<p>敝店於民國十七年在廣州創辦。十九年推而至香港。旋又籌設分店於滬濱。計滬店自開業以來。瞬届週歲。備荷各界不棄。惠臨光顧。同人等非常感慰。惟檢視過往之種種設施。尙多簡陋未周之處。良用赧愧。此後當益加奮勉。力圖精進。冀有以報各界愛護之熱忱。敬求大雅君子。不吝珠玉。示我周行。俾敝店得日漸改善。略樹旅館之規模。是豈特同人等所韾香祝禱。我國旅業前途。實利賴之。謹佈愚誠。伏維公鑒。再此次辱承黨國柱石。各界名耆。寵錫鴻詞。増光篇。幅。並此誌謝。　　　　　　賓玉如</p>
<h3 id="c2">從新亞創辦的動機説到奮鬥的成功　杜重遠 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>社會的改進，是需要多數有新思想，有自信力的人；從各方面來努力，來和惡社會奮勇搏鬥！</p>
<p>旅館是社會事業中的一種，一般經營的人向來趨重於牟利主義，社會上有许多不良的惡習，放在旅館裏，爲投客人的所好，從中漁利，旅客們於舟車劳頓之餘，極需要一個寗静的處所，休息他們或她們的身心，但是據個人的經歷，中國無論到任何地方，旅館裏總離不了煙·賭，瓖·娼三種惡習，一入其中，立時被惡濁喧囂的空氣所包圍，令你發生</p>
<p>極端的厭惡與痛苦，所以旅館予人的印象，是藏垢納污的總滙，是社會的病態源泉。　　民國廿一年，敝人在華南漫游的時候，偶然投宿在鍾君經營的新亞大酒店，偌大的旅館，無論職員和店夥，態度精神，都異常肅穆，鎭日價寂静無譁，覺得在國内各地，得未曾有，當時很景慕這位開旅館的主人。　　以後在上海認識了鍾君準先生，據鍾先生説；他創辦旅館的動機，是因爲在某年，有幾位英國朋友到中國來游歷，請他介紹一家眞正的中國旅館，鍾君當時很爲難，以爲中國旅館的種種腐敗情形，怎能介紹於外友，後來總算支吾了事，可是當時鍾先生受了極大的刺激，認爲中國其他重大事業，不及外人，猶可說也，難道連一個像樣的旅館，都建設不起來？覺得非常可恥，乃糾合同志，在廣東首創新亞大酒店，他經營旅館的目的，旨在矯正社會的惡習，和一般旅館專事牟利者，逈乎不同，店内不備鴉片煙，不許嫖妓和賭錢，這在一般人看來，自然以爲過於徧重理想，事實上不曾得到勝利的，而鍾君對於改進社會工作，抱有最大信念，他當時有兩句很堅决，値得紀念的話，他説；「新亞若失敗，不是新亞的失敗，是表示了中國的社會無法改良，新亞若成功，也不是新亞的成功，是證明了中國的社會，尙可救藥，」現在廣東新亞大酒店的營業，蒸蒸日上，而上海的新亞大酒店，又舉行盛大的週年紀念日了，這自然是鍾先生和惡社會奮鬥的勝利，同時充分證明了中國舊社會，倘有革新的可能，</p>
<p>敝人雖不是新亞的投資人，但是感於有思想有自信力的人，無論在某種惡環境下，只要百折不回，總可成功的，所以乘新亞舉行周年紀念的時候，很願意以笫三者的立塲，在百忙中，極興奮地來説幾句話，替他們介紹宣傳，並以區區所感，貢獻於創造新社會的同志！</p>

<p>丨談談中國的旅館丨</p>
<p>前年有八個月的時間，我過著旅行生活，東南西北各省行，足跡殆遍，住過的旅店，不下二百間，規模大小，雖不相同，可是裏面的情形，却没有多大分别，住後也就忘了，其中具有特點，在記憶中留有印象的，可以舉出四間。</p>
<p>第一間：在陜西永壽縣，寒冬的一夜，投宿當地最大的客寓。土墙圍着院子，是騾馬牲口起臥之處。稍進只得土房一間，丨其實是土窟：裏面一座土坑，坑内燒馬糞取暖，土房連板門都没有，只好把蘆席掛起當門簾，倦而就寢。夜半醒來，只見院子滿地白雪，反射着寒光，原來門簾已被北風吹下，土坑的火早熄了，人到天明，不能再睡，次日害了一塲傷風。</p>
<p>第二間：在廣西貴陽縣。小輪泊碼頭，踏上就是旅館。原來西江多浮筏，上蓋板房，似屋非屋，似船非船，别具風味，寓此亦頗有趣，入夜憑欄，江楓漁火，令人起天涯遊子之思！</p>
<p>第三間：與其説特别，不如説是最普通的各大商埠的旅館，幾乎完全一樣，那是在澳門的一夜，木板間隔的房，四壁通聲，前後左右，麻將牌嘩啦嘩啦的響，洋煙臭味，陣陣傅來，麻將的聲剛停，接着男女怪聲，又在叫了，閙得人整夜不能安睡，在那些旅館裏，嫖妓宿娼，本來亦難苛責，怪的何必嚷得那麽厲害；</p>
<p>以上三間，是比較不易忘記的旅館，但異日旅行，我决不想再次投宿領敎了，此外的一間，却與衆不同，我覺得要像這様才是旅客所需要的旅館，那就是廣州的新亞大酒店，因爲這旅館的物質設備，足使我們的精神舒暢，起居安適，管理的嚴密，招呼的妥善，使人感到一種親切的情誼，忘却身在逆旅之中，這種親切的感情，你是在任何旅館裏也得不到的，此點給我的印像最深，也令我最能忘記，至其三不主義，嚴厲地執行，免除了一般旅館裏喧擾雜亂，不潔的通病，最近蔣委員長所提倡各地所盛行的新生活運動，新亞大酒店，却已實行了多年了。</p>
<p>新亞大酒店，曾在港粤設立分店，經營数年，已獲得成功，去年來上海開設支店於北四川路，我虔誠地希望牠將來更遍設分店於全國各通都大邑，樹立旅館的新典型，我想這决不是我個人的希望，慣於出門的旅客們；都有同感吧。</p>
<p>蜚聲馳譽</p>
<h3 id="c4">我對於上海新亞大酒店之傾倒及貢獻　崔通約滄海 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>百凡事業，無不欲藉之以生利，此天下人心之同然也，然利之所在，人争趨之，於是有但求目的，不擇手段者，於是有爲求利故而害社會害人羣｜｜馴至害國家之荣譽者。輒曰·不營業則已，旣營業安有賢人，晚近間吾嘗習聞斯語矣，噫！不知幾許人甘由天堂而葬墳墓矣，尤其以經營旅業者爲甚，尤其以我粤人長袖善舞，善於經營偉大旅業者爲甚：　　吾於此雅不欲直揭旅業之名，更不欲直指新業者之如何宗敎信仰，惟問以我旅業專求私利之故，因而損害人類個體德性不顧焉，損害世風整個人道不顧焉，甚者阻礙人羣進化||傷及國家光榮亦不顧焉,亦何貴乎有此偉大旅業,尤何貴乎講道德説仁義者之厚集鉅資||而經營此偉大旅業也：　　滄海無似,古稀年届,自四十後薄遊歐美,略考察工商事業,知彼邦人士果皆聖賢乎,非也,彼邦旅業者果皆純潔</p>
<h3 id="c5">亞酒店亞新 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>無疵可議乎，非也，但揆之我國有一句「賓至如歸」之古訓，凡彼所經營旅業者，不論大小，求其最低限度，從無「擾及旅客清夢·」恐問之先後遊歷家，當亦衆口一詞所共信矣，若夫宿私娼，玩撲克，閙竹戰，深宵達旦，罔顧公徳，則雖自鄶以下之人所恥爲，曾有士夫商賈過問耶，至層楼大厦，仕女如雲，土木被錦繡，侍役具衣冠，更遑論哉：</p>
<h3 id="c6">上海新亞大酒廣厦同歡 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>雖然，世界之號稱大都會，實不　刹羅場活地獄之變相，上海其尤著，一般靑年男女，立足不牢，薰淘漸染，因而墮落敗徳，何可縷指，而旅館益爲藏垢納污之淵藪，苟操斯業之商界鉅子，不爲大者遠者計，徒爲小者近者謀，不爲商業道徳計，徒爲歌舞徴逐謀，當此江河日下，國運淪胥，猶不肯大刀闊斧，破釜沉舟，豈惟旅業名譽一落千丈，抑亦工商同歸於盡也：</p>
<p>或者曰，人之欲善，誰不如我，果如子言，人醉獨醒，人濁獨清，善則善矣，其如營業不振何，其如旅館之生涯無以爲活何，吾於此不得不五體投地，先傾倒崇拜粤港之，新亞大酒店之特樹一幟焉，吾於此不得不三鞠躬九叩首，復傾倒崇拜今日上海之新亞大酒店之再樹一幟焉，吾於此更希望新亞大酒店股東當事以至職員夥計，具大眼界，認定旅館爲人生之第二家庭，中國旅館尤當樹立指導百業之模範，大着胆量，向着光明之前途走，更向着打破因襲弊陋之邁步進，誠以上海爲今日世界著名之最大都會，登高一呼，衆山皆應，風聲所樹，賢者景從，滄海不敏，規之以因果律，推之以人心審義性，吾敢武斷可以藉是感動同業，且可以藉是開旅業之新模範，行見賓至如歸，營業發逹，殊堪操左劵也，爰貢獻新詩二章，聊作頌祝，詞曰：</p>

<h3 id="c46">論英法談話協調　恒 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>英法此次談話。必能迅速成功。早在論者意料之中。蓋一則英人祈望歐洲和平之心理。不殊於法人。二則英人意想中之敵人。在德不在法。包爾温所謂英國之邊疆。當在萊茵河岸。其意可知矣。三則薩爾歸屬問題解决之後。英國艾登更望各國爲進一步之行動。藉以奠定歐局。至在法國方面。亦以聯英爲必要條件。英若與法合作。則歐西方面之顧慮。卽可完全消釋。故法國外交。無論如何勝利。與國無論如何衆多。然仍必以聯英爲制德之關　。有此數點。故英法之恊調。實爲極自然之結果。不足爲異也。</p>
<p>就外電而觀今次英法談話之結果。不外三點。㈠爲訂立天空公約。㈡爲中歐問題。英國贊同羅馬恊定之辦法。㈢爲軍縮問題遵照一九三二年之五强宣言。第一種天空公约。卽所以補洛迦諾公約之不足。保西歐之和平。良以近日空戰。日見進步。英德之間。相去僅一衣帶水。易受襲擊。法德之間。壤地逼處。更爲可虞。英法此一計劃。實不啻爲空軍合作之變相。第二種中歐公約。依照羅馬恊定辦法。目的不僅在保障奥國之獨立。更在維持中歐之現狀。英國同意於此。足使中歐杌陧不安之局。轉危爲安也。第三軍縮問題。依照五强宣言。其卽謂於不危害各國。之安全中求軍備之平等。亦卽謂徳國若欲增加軍備。必須以加入上述二種公約。與復返國聯爲條件也。故今後歐洲外交舞　上之問題自必集中於此數點。再則若依五强宣言爲討論基礎。則奥匃等國。亦有重行武装之權利。如此。則歐洲之和平。雖因笙種種公約之締結而日見鞏固。然軍備之數量則將大事增加矣。</p>
<p>英法之談話。旣有若是結果。則今後之問題。自在德國矣據昨日歐電觀察。德國對於此次英法會談結果。殊爲满意對於中歐公約。亦有凖備討論之表示。由此而觀德國之態度似已抛棄其宿昔唯仗武力之觀念。以求國際之恊調若中途不生變化。則德之復返國聯。實爲意中事。唯德法之間。抵觸尙多全然恊調恐尙須長時期之折衝與談判耳。</p>
<p>歐洲一年以來。險象環生。陰霾四起。慘案之夥。遠過於大戰之前夕。而之虊庫之多。亦不减於當年。故關心時事者。莫不驚心動魄。以爲二次大戰。行將爆發。不謂危機屢見。皆能消弭於無形。及至今日。歐局大體已定前此歐洲國家之矛盾衝突。亦皆减少。其最著者。一爲法國與小恊約對俄關係之改善。二爲法意矛盾之消除。三爲英法恊調之重建。由此而觀此一年來雖爲歐洲最危險之時機。按之實際。實爲歐洲時局一轉危爲安之時期也。</p>

<p>（海參崴通信）</p>
<p>開發鑛藏　實施電化</p>
<p>過去幾世紀間、尤其是沙皇專制、革命運動甫經展開的時代、提到西比利亞一般俄國人、都不免寒噤失色、認爲那是人間的活地獄、因爲西比利亞地方、氣候險惡、人烟稀少、雖然西比利亞大鐡道修成之後、帝俄政府曾竭力獎勵民、但移植移的人民、還是很少、而被處流刑的人很多、所以一般人民對西比利亞的恐怖心理、直到如今、還相當的普遍、蘇聯政府在第一五年計劃期中、卽對比非常注意、第二五年計開始以來、更見要實行開發了、所以在徵税方面、特别减低税率、在供給方面、又格外予以優惠、</p>
<p>國防上遠東赤軍司令官蒲魯赫爾、在去年革命紀念節公言、『···我可以斷言遠東赤軍當擁護祖國國境的安寗、可以很鞏固的鎖着遠國境···』、這樣的詞句、表面是很和緩、但已强烈暗示其防禦的堅實、在海軍方面、有遠東海軍司令官兼遠東海軍軍事革命會議主席維克脱洛夫、指導指導如何改造海參崴軍港的建築、及潛水艦的補充、準備萬一有事變時、可以從容應付政治經濟、是由洛連切夫以共產黨遠東地方委員會書記名義、從事指導、還有一位决定最高指導方針的遠東地方執行委員長克爾多夫、這四個人、除蒲魯赫期（卽加倫將軍）比較知名外、其餘都是新鋭之士、在國外恐怕很少人知道、遠東地方、總面積約二百三十三萬二千平方公里（有現時德意志的五倍）、而人口則僅一百六十多萬、蘇聯政府鑑於遠東地方的重要、自九·一八事變後、更明白遠東方面所處的危境、所以除力修戰備以防萬一之外、更進一步考究各地方的特殊情形、天然物產、和民族狀况、并且將沿海省劃作遠東地方中的產業區、要開發它的煤炭·鐵·金·鋅·銀·等鑛藏、和漁業·森林、</p>
<p>沿海省要以「蒲勒亞」炭田爲鑛的中心、摢專家調查該處炭田埋藏量、約有一千億噸、算蘇聯第二大炭田、完全開發以後、不但阿本爾江沿岸的輪船、要用它的煤炭、卽伯力·柯木梭莫里斯克·畢洛比彊·等預定要建設的都市、都要由該炭坑供給燃料、沿海省本來是一個没有動力事業的地方、因此阻碍着一般事業的發展、現在正計劃着建設一所大發電廠、其發電能力要有十萬啓羅瓦特（KiloWatt）、工程費預定爲一萬萬盧布、現時從事工作的工人、爲二千五百名、完工時期要一年零兩個月、</p>

<p>（左）僞十軍國長劉疇西（右）僞　　十軍長兼僞十九師長王如痴</p>
<p>交通方面、從前烏蘇里鐡道、因爲交通需要不很大、所以「錯車」問題、并不曾感到十分嚴重、但是近來在軍事上、產業開發上、因「錯車」而躭誤時間、已覺十分不經濟、這纔敷設複軌、今年可完全成功、不過她還顧慮到將來、如果蘇日兩國發生萬一事變、烏蘇里鐡道及西比利亞鐡道、難免不被遮斷、所以又决定建築ＢＡＭ大鐡道、把貝加爾北部·阿木爾江下游·與廟聯絡起來、同時空中交通、由歐洲至廟街·庫頁島·北氷洋的「契柯脱加」·</p>
<p>等處一齊聯絡、就文化敎育關係而論、從前遠東地方、是極閉寒的、現在也漸次發逹了、他們不但有初級的讀本、并且有辭典之類的書籍了、例如沿海省、每一千人口中、就學兒童有一百三十五人、成人識字的占百分之八十五、在那裏的專門學校·大學勞工豫科·技術學校·工廠徒弟學校·等共有三十處、學生計八千一百餘人、因爲天產物的開發、人口的增加、文化程度的向上、所以一般消費、也同時　增漲、一九三三年比三一年加增百分之二百三十、一九三四年一月到十月增加到一九三一年的百分之四三○、可是消費品仍舊不足、一般社會的消費力和生產力、還是在向上增長、（一月十九日）</p>

<p>主席麥西報告、略謂、各位來賓、今天本會總會所舉行開幕典禮、承蒙各位蒞臨參加、不勝欣幸之至、鄙人謹代表本會理事部、向各位表示歡迎和谢意、按本會的發軔、早在去年七月間、當時工部局人力車務委員會就想從事於改善公用人力車夫生活、良以他們的生活、實在痛苦到極點、他們對於現代文明社會中人類多少所應享有的福利、都享受不到、此種情形、在一年前、工部局所出版的人力車研究季員會報告書中、已講得極詳細清楚、人力車務季員會、就受工部局董事會的付託、負責實施、經董事會通過的人力車研究季员會建議、當前尙有許多問題、不過今天鄙人的目的、並不要詳細報告各位、該會對於人力車研究委員會建議、究竟已經做了多少或者還有多少未辦、以及以後所希望做的是什麽等等、而乃是該會發起本會的目的、究竟什麽、人力車務委員會覺得負有計劃改善人力車夫生活的使命、亟宜成立社會保險的計劃、期使車夫及其家屬、因傷所受的災難、可以减輕、現在界内雖然已有不少的慈善機關、也從事此類工作、但他們多因財力有限、只能稍涉邊際、同時我們覺得要完成什麽事情必須要有確實的經費、所以我們决定唯一的方法、便是從受福利者的身上、自己拿出來、關於此點、一般而言、似乎很難實行、但是恰巧本會發軔之時正逢工部局實行核减車租、並因爲當時工部局决定、每日車租、必須减少約百分之二十五、我們就想到不妨每日由車夫自己拿出若干來、以給他們、辦理福利事業之用、可是車夫大多數缺乏知識、很難要他們自己組織起來、辦理自己的事情、所以我們又想到應該由他人來帮助他們、替他們辦理自己不能做的事情、講到這裹、本人覺得十分愉快的、便是當時工部局就想到有成立本會的利益、再毅然樂予倡遵提携、且願意幫助征收車夫的互助會費、而促成現在有效而完善的收欵辦法、不過鄙人覺得在此地必須聲明的、就是工部局對於本會、並無何種經濟上的責任、我們向車夫征收會費的辦法、是由車主每月毎輛、先替車夫代繳一元五角、工部局才准車主每日向車夫加收洋七分、車主繳納欵項、並不繳給工部局、乃直接繳給本會所擇定的銀行、不過工部局在每月發給車主執照的時候、要車主先呈騐已付互助會費的銀行收據後、才准予發給、同時工部局對於互助會財政、也有一種保管監察的權力、照本會章程規定、本會的保管委員、須由工部局聘請、本會一切費用、必須保管委員批准、才可拔付、後來工部局便推荐現任人力車務委員會三位委員、担任本會第一任三位保管委員、保管委員第一椿職務、就是聘請社會上熱心此種福利事業的人士、請他們組織理事部、關於此事、我們是已經成功了、不過這多是承蒙各位熱心人士參加、並且在過去六個月間、他們又積極恊助本會的成立、鄙人謹以主席的資格、向他們道謝云云、（下略）</p>

<p>從無不規則行爲、回答胡如必要接洽者、本人女流、不懂世故、可與我丈夫見面接洽、電話遂即掛斷、同日下午七時許、胡曉東（年廿七歲、皖人、）偕其同伴廣告員朱文檜（年卅三歲甬人、）同至盛家、與盛炳如見面、談論刊載此項新聞問題、并出油印新聞底稿一紙、男女合攝之照片一張、盛驟覩底稿照片、驚駭痛恨、請胡等留下、約以容待商量之後、明日答覆、胡·朱·二人</p>

<p>而去、盛將新聞稿及照片示其妻方氏、氏覩及照片、對夫立誓、生平絶無與男子合拍肖照之事、至此、盛炳如始知胡·朱·兩人之來、實係蓄意敲詐、損人名譽、一笑置之、至次日、胡·朱·二人又至盛處聽回音、即由盛報告法捕房、由探目錢裕民·包探鍾本昌·赴盛家、將胡·朱·二人拘案、訊據胡等供出此項新聞及照片、由北四川路四百八十五號頋鄉酒排間主甬人李義（即李家仁、年卅二歲、）指使、照片</p>

<p>等語、該探等即會同公共捕房派探赴北四川路四八五號頋鄉酒排間、將李義拘獲、并在李處抄出李拍照片所穿之西裝衣服一套、又往派克路恊和里二十號剛報館内抄出新聞底稿、照相銅板、帶回捕房後、方氏憶及於十三年前、曾與鄰居小姊妹即李妻及李妹等游城隍廟有興三人偶攝一照片以外别無拍過照片、即設法找出原照片、送交捕房核對、與李處抄出之銅板、</p>

<p>顧應賠償損失一萬四千五百餘元</p>

<p>被告請求駁回原告全部控訴之最重要理由、即因所訂契約、純係賭博行爲耳、緣該三紙契約、均規定買主應先交付保證金、賣方始能代爲定貨、倘證金不先交付、自無代爲定貨之義務、而該約不能認其成立、現無論任何一紙所規定之保證金、被告皆未交付、則該約顯未成立、原告尤無代爲定貨之義務、况其字裏行間、復含賭博性質與類乎交易所之行爲、如其申九月四日所訂</p>

<p>致政府無法施行統一經濟之政策、今乃除銀行外、更增交易所、引誘國要人往外國投機賭博、誠堪痛心、故本案所争數額、雖甚細微、而關係前途極鉅、應請明察、宣告各約無效云云、原告律師斐斯、旋予駁復、謂本案並非外人在中國經營交易所、而係華人委託外人向外國定貨、實與中國交易所法風馬無關、且類本案性質之交易、日所恒有、貿易自由、向不受何限制、若以本案之交易爲違法、</p>

<p>郭公使闡揚中國畫特點</p>
<p>中央社倫敦通訊、吾國藝術家劉海粟、前年由政府派赴柏林辦理中國美術展覽會博得不少佳評、歐洲各國多敦請劉氏巡迴展覽、先後至漢堡萊河茵、及荷蘭之海牙、阿姆司脱達姆瑞士之日内瓦泊爾納法京捷京等十餘大城展覽、我國駐英公使郭泰祺、以劉氏此次所徵集之作品、足以代表吾國現代各畫派、故於去年三月、即電請劉氏來英展覽且英京地大人衆、尤多東方學者於吾國文化之宣揚、關係切要、後以劉氏與各國當局有約在先、故遲至去年十一月劉氏始由日内瓦來英劉氏到英後、即勘定新百靈敦畫院NewBurlingtonGallery爲會場、並歷訪藝術家及文藝批評家倫敦大學美術研究院、UniversitvofLondonCourtauldInstiluteofAct院長康司推勃爾敎授Prof·Coustable見劉氏作品後、尤爲推重、而與以種種助力去年十二月十二日、郭使柬邀英大學委員會鄢友敎授Prof·Ｐ·Yotts亞特士敎授Prof·Adaws婁司爵士SirDonison·Ross·等十二人、至中國使館舉行籌備會議、當决定（一）二月二十二日開幕、二十一日預請報界文藝界參觀、（二）請皇太子行揭幕禮、（三）將代表作品陳列館於十二月二十九日柬邀外交團文藝名流報界學術界評判、（四）請敎育部總長赫萊法克士LordHalifax爲會長、威廉爵士SirWcllihneDenrlly康士福爾特子爵夫人CauntessGasford　詹姆士爵士sirjamesLockhart　皮寗敎授Prof·LaurenceBinyon康司推勃爾敎授ProfW·G·Conslable等二十餘人爲季員十二月二十九日、中國公使郭泰祺招待各界預展中國畫茶會與會者、有各國駐英大使公使文藝界報界名流二百餘人、很多是老年人、也有中年人、均極熱烈愛好中國藝術、非常高興來會參加｀讚賞中國名畫、英國現代文藝批評家中、觀察精透至藝術方面達到最高之完成者、當首推羅蘭别寗LaurenceBinyon伊著作甚多、又係是最大詩人、關於批評中國畫、有PaintinginheForEas　t一書曾透澈發表中國畫中之哲學思想及中國人之人生觀、以及歷史人物典型、伊對於劉氏之作品、亦異常欣贊、郭使對於展覽會更始終烈熱贊助、曾作有一篇闡明中國畫之序文云、東方藝術、實以中國爲代表、蓋日本文化皆由中國輸入、即美術史之年歷、亦僅中國三分之一、故其繪畫作品、多諠染中國之色彩、惟無中國畫之氣韻耳、印度雖爲古代文明之邦然自唐代而後佛敎寂滅、藝術亦漸消沉、故欲知東方之藝術、均當以中國爲代表此邦人士有鑒於、</p>
<p>此、爰發起大規模分别展覽中國古美術及現代名畫、今中國現代名畫展覽會、將於二月二十一日起在新百靈敦畫院開幕、爰略述其要旨如左、</p>
<p>此次所集名作、是由中國政府委托蔡元培院長、葉恭綽部長、劉海粟敎授所蒐集、皆中國各地各派大使之傑作、而劉先生本人之精品、亦有數十幅之多、此次作品自一九三四年一月起、先後在柏林漢堡杜塞特而夫Dusseldorfer·敏興、海牙阿姆斯特達姆日内瓦泊爾納Berne巴黎諸城展覽而得佳評者、</p>
<p>中國繪畫不僅着眼於寫形、更注意於心靈之表現、畫派多以水墨爲上、畫法多以氣韻生動爲主是也、六法之目、劈頭即舉氣韻生動、洵謝赫之卓見、歷代美術史家、批評家皆祖述之、氣韻之解釋、各家雖不必皆同、吾今作一最易領會之説明、則所謂氣者、即神氣氣魄氣味意趣｀即作者自己之個性及感想、所謂韻者爲節奏内在之深味、生者爲生生活潑之氣、動者即動的精神活躍顯著之謂也、明畫家董其昌曰一氣韻不可學生而知之、自然天授讀萬卷書、行萬里路、勉强學之耳」畫無氣韻與照相機何擇焉、中國畫之氣韻、欲掩而不能掩、不經意之中自現於筆墨之表、如照相派之寫實製品、則毫無氣韻、不僅爲機械之作用、且全爲自然所役使、將以眼爲鏡頭、以心爲暗箱矣、藝術之作品、單以現實爲　志、其乾燥無味、則與照相機何異、故中國畫家、多爲文人、能書能詩、始能成爲大家、從書詩的含養中、流出無垢無塵、流出獨特之風趣、有意到筆不到之妙味、宋蘇東坡曰、「當其下筆風雨快、筆所未到氣已吞」、即此之謂也、又在中國、不特畫家能詩能書、即歷代有名之大政治家、亦多能詩能畫能書、且有大畫家而兼政治家者、如唐之王維李思訓、宋之蘇東坡、元之趙之昂、明之蓋其昌、乃其顯著者也、「所謂畫中有詩詩中有畫」蓋詩歌文學繪畫、均有密切之關係、流風所被、至今綿綿不絶、此亦中國文化上特殊現象也、</p>
<p>余今持節此邦、闡揚中國文化乃吾之職、爰略述中國畫之特殊點、以爲觀衆介紹、至於陳列品之究竟如何、尙待專家之高評焉、駐英全權大使郭泰祺、</p>

<p>上海各界公定今年爲學生國貨年，我以爲應該改爲敎師國貨年，來得切實些。</p>
<p>因爲學生平日的言動，一以敎師的言動爲依歸；假如敎師拚命地以身作則，愛用國貨，嚴訓學生也用國貨：學生的腦筋，當然深印「國貨」二字，而厭棄洋貨了。</p>
<p>我們地方有一句俗語，呌做：「手不動廿四，」不知是何意義，但究其語氣，是譏人横豎不肯工作的形容詞。</p>
<p>我因此希望大家務要在今年各就本位，伸起手來苦幹，實幹以救國，不要應了這句俗語才好。</p>

<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>陰雨了幾天，氣候很和暖，滿以爲廢曆歲暮，再不能見太陽，再不會河冰下雪了；然而一夜西風，狂掃滿院乾葉，水缸凍成玻璃，金魚的游影不復能見，連滿天的雪花也飛得起勁。</p>
<p>昨天含苞的梅語，却在風雪偷偷地中開出那樣媚人的紅花。自家獨坐在牕　下，静静地找尋殘冬的詩料，只聽得幾頭雲雀踏在雪花上的足音，聽得隔墻飄來的風　的歌唱，也聽到了自家心房跳躍的微聲。</p>
<p>看梅花的紅瓣，慢慢地消失，空間盡是粉一樣的雪花，儘一點一點的飛，一簇一簇的堆積，把梅樹的椏枝上，裝飾得純白了，愈白愈肥，愈肥也愈白。而不怕寒涷的麻雀，跳到東，跳到西，把頸項一摇，低頭去啄雪，啄一口，又抬起頭來環顧四面。那姿態眞是悠閒愉快得曼妙！</p>
<p>忽然，一個隣家的女孩子，從那茅房的邊門溜出，伊穿着短靴，身披一襲白羊毛衫，輕輕地走到雪地上，黑亮的長髮，因了跳躍的步武，在掀動，在浪舞；而却幽手幽脚她躡在麻雀之後，伸着雙手，似乎要捉捕的樣子。可是不待走近，小麻雀好像有着靈感般的，銜着一片雪，拍翼很快地飛上了梅花樹去，回過身，向女孩了槎槎地呌。孩子眼巴巴的望着樹上，恨不能生出翅膀的神情；而一朶梅花，恰恰給雀啄下，爲在孩子底眼睛裏，被伊捉住，便微笑了。</p>
<p>雪越下越大，孩子在雪中漫步，滿身已全是茫茫的白花；只露出半個涷紅了的小脸，脸上有兩顆閃亮的眼珠，和掩蔽了額角的黑潤的髮浪。·········天氣已是春天了！</p>
<p>這些這些，我從牕隙裏看得很清楚，然而无不敢咳一次嗽！</p>
<h3 id="c268">伸手將軍 <a href="#c268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>照例，將軍的手是該用來握指揮刀，抓望遠鏡的！要是用來鬥牌，摟女人，已是辱没了將軍的手！然而伸手將軍却專用着它向人要錢，且又要不到整千整萬的錢，你想，這是多麽丢「將軍」的臉！</p>
<p>你有時也得停留在電車站口守候電車吧，那你總該認識伸手將軍的了！他們雖不能追踪伍員，吹箫行乞，但沿門托缽的倒也很少，並且也不像唱「鄭板橋灘簧」的不肯用手接錢那般假裝清高；他們老實不客氣的伸着手討，氣槪倒是够雍容的！</p>
<p>將軍中有斷手的，有瞎子，有啞子；品級雖説各異，「釘功」却同樣的高明！祇要看到你從烟紙店掉得銅元跑向電車站來，他們就預備招待你啦！擎着半截手臂或是吚吚呀呀東衝西撞地老纏着你。你當然覺得討厭，但你是在候電車的，未便遠離站口，你祇能把隻臉躱東閃西的避開他，他也就左右逢源地聲聲「老爺發財」的奉承着你，你又未便光火，而電車又老不見到，局促的情勢使你不得不破費個子兒把他打發開去。這種要錢的手叚眞硬！不硬，他們怎能稱得起「將軍」！</p>
<p>「釘功」有時也須兼用「腿功」。我曾很榮幸地給一位將軍從八仙橋恭送到西新橋，這纔「禮成」而退！我當時雖因受寵若驚而感到局促不安，但現在想來能在將軍面前顯一顯腿力，給他一個「望塵興歎」，這倒是値得自豪的！</p>
<p>將軍下「釘功」時據説也有「口號」。口號的目的當然在要錢。但遇到兩個女人，他就會喊「兩個太太，給一個吧」！這却有些混帳！但「兩個太太」却又未便和他理論，而他又死釘着在後方喊口號，於是銅元鏘琅琅摔到地上，將軍也就很知禮的「鞠躬」而退了！</p>

<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>在我們這屋子裏，没有水汀管，没有火爐，甚至，連一個起碼的炭盆都没有。是很寛暢的古老的屋子呢，門窗都不完整了，在這隆冬，風，尖刻地打布幔裏和没有了明瓦的窗格窟窿裏竄進來，把那架吊在堂屋中間的紫銅座，白壳罩，保險燈也吹得震蕩起來了。鄰居和親友們是常常替我們擔着心事的。「你們這屋子太泠了吧！」</p>
<p>「泠嗎，不覺得。」</p>
<p>「我們倒還微微感到一些暖意呢！」</p>
<p>每晚，我們一家子就全在這屋子裏會聚着了。爹爹打舖子裏携着他唯一的心腹丨水烟袋，一張老是帶着微笑的嘴躱在八字鬚下面，回來。媽媽總很高興地報告一些白天的經過，菜市上什麽東西貴了或賤了，門口的走路人跟走路人打起架來，又怎樣被伊勸開，怪有勁地。我和弟弟最遲亦在六點鐘到家了，有時會在路上買些爹媽愛吃的東西回去，也跟自己的妻丨一心，另外包一些，預備夜間在房裏交給伊。</p>
<p>我們圍在一張桌子上吃睌飯，談天，讀報，講社會新聞，個個的嘴巴，眼睛，鼻子，在不同的方式下動作着，有時，連我們的眼睛亦會笑了起來，我們忘記了這寒泠的季節，也不知道朔風的厲害。</p>
<p>充溢在我們這寛暢古老的屋子裏的，是丨</p>
<p>父母之愛，兄弟之愛，夫妻之愛，有那麽熱烈哪！</p>

<p>他有了這一點微意，倒不肯含糊過去，在屋子裏睡一會子，坐一會子，静静的去想着，如何能够借了程志前的力量，可以去找一個好位置，而且是不會挨打的。他默念了許久，到底想出一個辦法來了。今天這宴會塲上，也許有那高廳長在内，我就臨時寫一個字條，由茶房交給程志前，求他介紹我和他見見。他今天受了我這樣重的禮品，這一點小小的要求他總不好意思不理。這年同在外面求差事，有縫就得鑽上前去，那裏容得仔細的考量？他將辦法想妥了，就静等時候的到來。一到這天下午六點鐘，天色還不怎樣的黑。前面大餐廳裏，兩盞汽油燈依然同時點着。那呼呼呼的火燄聲，在後院廊子下，都聽得清十分的扎耳。在這没有電燈的世界裏，隔着窗子，看那通明的光亮，就可以理想到那邊是一種如何鋪張的情形了。漸漸的男女喧笑之聲，由窗户裏透了出來，想必是赴宴會的人，已經來到，張介夫背了兩手，在廊子上踱來踱去，看看程志前屋子裏，混黄色的煤油灯光，依然亮着，想必是他還没有去赴席。當然是必等他去了，才可以談到自己所要求的事。踱了好幾個來回，他還在煤油燈下看書。雖然窗子外有人踱來踱去，他也不抬頭看一眼。介夫本想打他一個招呼，又念到别人赴席與否，與自己何干，又何必多那個事，只索罷休，且走出後院去看看。這院外是　個大敞院，是預備遠路客人，停長途汽車的所在。（一二七）</p>

<p>太后一提到這事，便立卽變换了很憤懣的態度，説話也不像先前那樣的温和了。「然而我們怎麽知道呢！伊的外貎一般也長得非常端正秀麗啊」！誰想到伊的性格是那樣的拙劣！伊對於我們只當敵人一般的仇視着，從不曾有過絲毫的好感！」</p>
<p>依照普通人家的情形而論，婆婆和媳婦往往是家庭中最不易調和的敵對份子，而且理由總是非常複雜，不易研究的。就像慈禧太后和嘉順皇后的不睦，差不多久已成爲一件公開的事實，但所以不睦的理由，却又傳説紛紜，莫衷一是。據我所知道的是爲着嘉順根本瞧不起慈禧的緣故。伊爲什麽要瞧不起伊丈夫的母親呢？實在是因爲伊在未進宫之前，早已知道慈禧年輕時曾經和榮祿發生過戀愛關係的秘密，不免就存着輕視之心。尤其是當咸豐升天之後，太后便馬上把榮祿的官職擢升起來的一回事，丨其實太后雖把榮祿升了官，但他們依舊是不能接近的，連握手的機會也可以説是絶對的没有。丨更使嘉順心中不滿；伊認爲一個母儀天下的女人，除掉自己的丈夫之外，無論如何，决不能再對别個男人發生什麽情感。於是太后在伊的心目中，便看做是一個不値得尊敬的人了！「譯者按：這一節叙述，新奇固然很新奇，但可信的成分，是很低的！容　郡主爲本報所寫的序文中，已特别的加以糾正了。（二三七）</p>

<p>儘管政府當局三令五申命老百姓過陽歷年，可是本牌的中國人是喜歐過土產的陰歷年的，卽就是把「陰歷」叫做「廢歷」也没有用，大多數國民是樂意廢物利用的。這情景，尤其是過年節時可以比較出。陽歷年節除掉機關學校放三天假外，是與一般民間的實際生活不發生關係的。可是一到廢歷年關，情形就大不相同了，尤其是在這古色古香的北平，隨處揚溢着年節的景象，不論是寛廣的大街上，或是狹窄的胡同口。</p>
<p>倘然你吃飽了「花捲兒」没有正經事，坐在家裏又嫌火爐烘得燥嗓子，那麽你不化錢的消閒辦法就是閒蹓踛，你蹓躂到北平數一數二的熱閙去處，像東安市塲，西單商塲，前門大街，大栅攔等等地方，那你就可以碰到擠擠攘攘的人羣，那人羣的社會成分又是光怪陸離的那般複雜，有把眉毛畫得新月樣的姨太太，口紅塗得鮮血般的高貴小組，戴金絲眼鏡皮帽子的寓公，穿藍布大褂的大學生，着男西裝褲的女學生，有大餅樣的髮髻，小脚裹得椎子樣的老式太太，蹈厚底鞋披紅風帽的遺少，樸質的商人，短衣的苦力，·········五花八門，眞是人物大展覽。他們有的是在舉辦「年貨」，有的是在「趕熱閙」，亂烘烘的叫賣聲，討價還價聲，組成都市的交響樂。商店照例是堆足了貨色，標貼着「大减價」「不顧血本大出清」的幌子，誘惑他們的主顧。</p>
<p>所謂年貨，無非是把蜜棗，花生，柿餅，靑梅等等混合在一塊兒的「雜拌」紙糊的花燈，長毛　　的兎兒爺燈，送灶皇用的灶皇殿，長線香，紅蠟燭，香瓜子，西瓜子，花生，香果，柿子等等，這些東西，花費不多，大家小户多要舉辦，買回去燒羹，祭祖供神騙小孩，度過一年一度的年節。雖然世界的不景氣以及華北政局的動盪，把他們苦壞了。但商人們小販們是不甘心把年節的「旺季」輕易放鬆的，依然得强打精神硬張羅。可是像我們閒蹓躂的人們是冷眼看得很清的，市塲上的人們雖然擠得這樣緊，而挖腰包「滿不在乎」購買貨色的闊老究屬是少數，大多數人多是抱着看熱閙的心情來趁高興。</p>
<p>「故都年節的景象是熱閙的，可是大多數過年人的心是同苦惱的」。當我離開市塲走在風沙瀰漫的胡同裏時心頭默默的想。</p>

<h3 id="c274">藝術的槪括 <a href="#c274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— 孟加</p>
<p>關於「藝術的槪括」，企君的「現實的與浪漫的」一文也稍曾涉及；然而在那裏作者祇是一般地泛論牠，並不曾把牠作爲現實主義創作方法底中心問題而處置着：</p>
<p>所謂「槪括」並不祇是藝術上的特殊用語，在科學上「槪括」也同樣地發揮着極大的作用，惟因兩者表現方法不同，故其槪括的表現結果也異，在這裏「槪括」正是現實底認識方法底一個主要的契機，作者在許多人物或事件中，抽出其本質的典型的若干面而與以綜合的表現，所謂特徵的强調」也卽指此。</p>
<p>一般地説來，科學與藝術的差别，主要地是在於表現方法之不同，卽前者是借助於抽象的槪念之現實底認識，而後者則借助於具體的形象；科學的方法是從抽象進於具體，而藝術的方法則從具體進於抽象，然而這種區别可不是絶對的，科學的方法是從抽象進於具體，但科學離開具體與直感卽不能存在；藝術的方法乃由具體（直感）出發，然而這也並不就是説科學底抽象的方法於藝術中全然不能適用，科學由於抽象並槪括現實底多樣性，個别性而被構成，藝術則原原本本地描寫出現實之中的多樣性個别性，這話在一般上是正確的，然而却不是絶對的，爲的藝術也時常槪括現實之故，例如作家當描寫人物時，决不是一個個的描寫，乃是在許多人物中，屏棄其偶然的非本質的差異，抽取其典型的，特質的若干面（如習慣趣味，欲望，信仰，語法等等）綜合而成爲一個典型底的人物的。</p>
<p>然則藝術的槪括與理論的槪括兩者的差别在什麽地方呢？通常以爲科學的（理論的）槪况是抽象的，而藝術的槪况則是具體的，這種見解可是錯誤的。因爲就是科學的眞理也好，藝術的眞理也好，都祇不過是存在於現實中的客觀眞理底表現，而眞理却始終是具體底的，故而藝術的槪况與理論的槪括的差别，並不在於兩者所表現的眞理底抽象性或具體性，不在於眞理之内容，而在於表現形式的不同上。科學眞理之所以是具體的，並不是因爲牠原原本本地存在於現實中，而是因其適應現實底本質之故；然而僅以此仍不成其爲藝術底的眞理，藝術的眞理必須在存在於現實中的直接的姿態上再現實的本質，藝術的槪括也以不失現實底直接性爲前提，在這一點上，所謂感性的形象性乃成爲問題。</p>
<p>藝術跟科學同樣，其任務乃在於現實生活之認識，因而，爲着集中認識的力量，乃必須滌清一切偶然和非本質和現象於現實之外，而進一步掘發現實底本質。在這裏藝術的槪括也正同科學和槪括一樣，其目的在於現實生活底本質底掘發，卽作爲現實底認識方法和一個主要的契機而被處理着的。故而藝術的槪括之正確性或眞實性不但被决定於作家底認識的觀點底性質，同時也被决定於作家底表現和能力之充分與否，决不如企君所説和那末簡單，是一個「屬於作家底創造的想像力或幻想」的問題，卽使藝術的槪况有時成爲一種卓絶的「預言」預見了未來的時代底典型，這也並不如企君所説的是被决定於作家底豐富的想像力或幻想，而是被决定於作家對於現實底認識底深　的程度上的，因爲或一作家要是想理解歷史法則底未來的進展形態，首先就非深刻地理解歷史法則之過往及現在的發展形態不可；蓋前者也無非後者之發展底更高形態而已。</p>
<p>關於槪括在藝術上的作用，俄國批評家柏林斯基曾精警地説過如下的話：</p>
<p>「有才能的藝術家在畫布之上所創造的風景，比在自然中之一切繪畫底的眺望還要來得優美。爲什麽呢？因爲在其中没有什麽偶然的殘餘的東西，一切部分都從屬於整體，一切都傾向於一個目的，一切都形成一個美底的全體的，而且個别的東西。</p>
<p>現實自身是優美的。然其所以美，乃在其本質，其諸要素，其内容，而不在其形式。在這一意味上，現實乃是像還未被清滌和礦石和土的塊狀物的純金似的東西。丨科學與藝術即洗清這一現實底金塊而賦與以優美的形式。」</p>
<p>從而偉大的藝術决不是無差異地記錄現實底現象，而是應該從正確的前進的觀點加以整理統一再現的。</p>
<p>藝術的槪括是條件底的。而這種條件是被决定於槪括的對象的。作家在施用藝術的槪括這一方法時，必得注意被槪括的兩種以上的現象底差别是本質的還是偶然的。所謂藝術的槪况乃是指後一者差别而説的。藝術的槪括不能超越時代（如指時代的事件底槪括）也不能超越階層（如人物底典型的槪括）。作家决不能槪括不同時代的事件，也不能槪括不同階層，不同生活的現實的人物。</p>
<p>人物底典型是具體的，因時代之不同而呈現不同的面貌。「八十年代的（俄國）智識份子，一方面對於革命運動的破壞，發生失望，不滿；另一方面又感到資本主羲發展遲滯的痛苦。智識份子在這樣急遽轉變的時代里，要找尋自己的地位和快活，於是大都墮入「小事件」理論的迷夢中，只圖獲到自己個人的快活，經營自己個人生活中的瑣碎細事、不然便跑到托爾斯泰理論的旗幟下，反抗文明的發展，只注意私人道德的修養完成」。然而跟着九十年代的來臨，跟着資本主義的向前發展，整個平民智識份子階層的社會地位的改變，那些「］不思索的，缺乏感情的」，感到「生活的彩衣已經褪色，只留下些暗淡的雜色斑跡」，而希望到墓墳中去找尋一些「幸福的幻影」的八十年代的智識份子，也就漸漸的减低他們的厭世思想和頺廢和情緒，而在靈魂着燃燒着生活的樂趣和對於未來光明的憧憬了。九十年代契可夫的作品中的典型的人物，大都是「昻着頭大膽地瞻望着前面」的。「訂婚」中抛棄了家鄉，跑到莫斯科讀書的娜黛，也正是作爲新象徵的代表者而呈現的。過去的空虚的情緒在新的人物底生活中消失了，現在在他們心頭燃燒着的，是未來的光明丨平民式的自由底憧憬。</p>
<p>一句话：藝術的槪括是條件底的；因而所謂典型的性格的形象也該是時代底的，階級底的。在這種意味上，掘發了歷史底特定階段氏本質的偉大的作品，也該是劃期的勞作的吧。</p>

<h3 id="c276">菩提寺 <a href="#c276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— 香山</p>
<p>懷戀於開着寂寞之花的菩提寺。</p>
<p>住在市外，從太陽掛在寺裏井户的樑上時，我就潛進寺後的墓塲。在這　　的孤墳的夾道裏，帶着一顆修道院僧尼的心，來回地徘徊着。</p>
<p>寺裏没有和尙，祇有看廟的年老人，淡淡焉的拿着掃箒，清閑的掃着雞啄爛了的白梅花。</p>
<p>菩提寺的可戀之處，是在寺後的墓塲，墓塲有一種無韻的寂静，是一首素樸感傷的詩；在那大理石或花崗石的墳碑上，鐫刻着亡去了的人間之名，這能使人憶起所謂可歌可泣的歷史的興衰。何况那簇生了靑苔的碑口，更能使人感到荒漠的愁緒。</p>
<p>活着時，都是陌生的人呵，可是在瞑了目後，陌生的人都聚集在這小小的墓塲裏了，同樣地被梅花的殘花，落滿了墓石，同樣的聽看廟人敲起鐘梵之音，没有喜悦，更無論妬嫉，都安静地撫慰在冬天的陽光裏。</p>
<p>在墓碑的前面，放置着石刻的石盆，清澄的水，映着蒼穹之雲，當寒風蕭蕭從枯枝間漏下來，飄過水面時，那漪漣的小紋，把雲塊給摺亂了。而那挿在水盆裏的草花之影，也微微顫動，凝在草花上的水滴，似珠的墜入盆裏，這水滴是否謁墓人的眼淚，誰知道呢？這水滴是晶瑩的呵！</p>
<p>在菩提寺的正堂的屋脊上，有無數羽的麻雀，晒着冬陽，那喧閙之音，啼破了墓塲的午後这静寂。如果在寺外的　　裏，響起來汽槍的獵音時，麻雀就似烏芝麻似的，飛舞在清澄的空中，當羽翼振搏之謦消失了的時候，則墓塲裏更顯得寥寂，單調；使徘徊於夾道上的自己，感到可恐的静穆；把微温的太陽，疑是清凉的月亮了。</p>
<p>去年冬天，在伊豆半島的伊東温泉鄉避寒時，曾宿在某菩提寺的近隣下宿裏。伊東是水鄉，前窗即面着碧清的海原，後窗下即是菩提寺後的墓塲，墓塲的後面，即是漸漸峻高上去的枯黄了的冬山。到了黄昏，從海原上瀰漫起霧般的夜幕，而後山的温泉的蒸氣，也漸漸地沉向山脚，渡過墓塲垂掛在後窗上了；這時，我獨自地耽於冥想之中，盤着膝兀坐，而心裏感到有𡯓尶的蔭影，從後窗裏鑽了進來，覺得是種犀利的的膽寒的快味。</p>
<p>這座寺裏的看廟人，是個風流的老人，每當夜闌時常有種激厲荒凉的淒幽的謦音，從老人的屋裏飄了出來，這是老人唯一的道樂之「尺八」的音曲呵！「尺八」常能發出怨絶愁絶哀音，好像是塞外的羗笛，這能勾起鄉愁，但有時常被這聲音所魅惑，無由的可以落起淚來，這淚是温馨的，容我妄喻吧！這流淚的心情，宛似有罪的孩子，在慈母的懷裏懺悔時的心情一樣呵。</p>
<p>常常在睡夢中醒來的時候，聽到後窗下墓塲裏有凄凄的禽聲：心不能耐時，就披衣　開後窗的「雨　」，則滿　　　着明月，清冽似白刃地舞在眼前，墓碑都染得晶白，祇有正堂的濃蔭，落在霜上，黑白相映，有種　道的情趣；而那山麓地帶的梅樹叢的花，却像白靄似地，低低地　着地面，黄香雜着海的微腥，使自己感到特殊的滋味。而由是對於菩提寺的懷戀之情，却愈更深切了。</p>
<p>無論是寺裏的一株花，一隻鐘，都含有使人感慨與瞑想的魔力，尤其在寺裏的角隅，或樹叢下，孤地立着的石雕之地藏像，尤能使人凝然而忘却痛苦。地藏像是微笑的微胖的頭陀，滿身都印着風雨的剥蝕之痕，然而臉上的笑痕，還依舊地笑向着萬人；披着紅色的施毛捨與之斗蓬，身上垂着烏雀的糞跡，却還平凡地笑着，在人間能找到如此的笑臉，恐怕祇有這石雕的地藏吧！</p>
<p>看了這地藏，能憶起古典的舞誦劇「御夏狂亂」來，一個被棄的女人御夏，如何地在地藏像前瘋狂，而地藏却依舊微笑而不語的情景來，石雕的地藏爲什麽不能與御夏以熱情和安慰呢，這微笑是冷笑嗎？使我竦然了。</p>
<p>現在是住在離有菩提寺極遠的僻巷裏了，每日倦於市聲與機械聲的身子，在憑窗默坐，或夢裏時，常感到自己還徘徊於菩提寺的墓塲裏，看碑石，水盆，井户和微笑的地藏，而尤其默默地背誦那塊石板曾留了我的足跡，那條夾道曾徘徊了幾百回的事情，與心中苦痛時，以一鎭痛的安静的良藥。　　　我是懷戀着菩提寺的，菩提寺還常盛開着寂寞之花，在初春時，還溢盈着比酒還醇芬的空氣的。</p>
<p>菩提寺是寥寂的，寺後的墓塲是更寥寂的　　，孤墳都無言的佇在樹蔭之下。</p>

<p>— 馬克特温作立波譯</p>
<p>答應我一個朋友從東方寫信來的要求，我去訪問一位温良的，饒舌的老人西門。威勒，問訊我的朋友的朋友，内安尼逹斯·史密吕，這就是我的朋友的要求，這訪問的結果我將寫在下面。我有個隐隐的疑慮，我懷疑内安尼逹斯·史密吕是想像中人；我的朋友並不曾認識這麽一個人物；他只是計算着我如果向那老威勒問起他的時候，會使他想起他那醜惡的金姆·史密吕，而他會開始講述一些又臭又長，對於我毫無用處，使我煩厭要命的他的誇張的回憶。如果這就是目的，那是逹到了。</p>
<p>在衰敗的安琪爾鑛山幕地的一家破陋的酒店裏，我找到了西門·威勒，這老頭子正在酒排間的火爐邊上安適地打盹。我注意他是肥胖的，秃頭的，在他的恬静的面容上露着一種可愛的温厚和簡單的表情。他跳起來，和我道了日安。我告訴他我有一位朋友叫我來探問他一個童年的親暱的朋友名叫内安尼逹斯·史密吕，可敬的内安尼逹斯·史密吕，一位年輕的傳敎師，他聽到他曾經做過安琪爾幕地的居民。我加着説，如果威勒先生能够告訴我一些關於這位可敬的史密吕的什麽時，我將非常感谢他。</p>
<p>西門威·勒把我向後推到一個角落裏，用他的椅子把叙下面那單調的故事。他從不笑，他從不縐眉，他從不换一换彈出那第一句話的圓潤的樂鍵，他從不洩露一絲絲熱情的嫌疑；可是在這整個的不盡的故事裏、流貫一種動人的熱心和眞摰的脉搏，明白地顯示我，一點也没有想像他的故事裏有什麽奇異或可笑的東西，他把牠當作一種眞實的重要的事，而且讚歎着那裏面的兩位主人公在權術上是了不起的天才。我隨他自己的便利講去，從來没有打斷過他一次。</p>
<p>「可敬的内安尼逹斯，唏，可敬的内丨丨不錯，這裏曾經住過一個名叫金姆·史密吕的人，是在一八四九年冬天，或者也許是在一八五○年春天吧丨丨我記不清楚了，總是這兩個時間的那一個，因爲我乾得他初到幕地時，山溪還没有乾，但是他眞是一個最好奇的人物，在你所看到的一切東西身上，他總要發賭，如果有人做他的反面對乎的話；而且如果找不到反面對手時，他願意換邊來賭。無論怎樣，合人家的意的總合他的意丨丨無論怎樣，他只要找到了赌，他就心滿意足。但是他也幸運，非常幸運；他老是赢家。他老是準備賭機會；没有一樣想得到的東西他不願意賭，而且，我剛剛告訴過你，他隨便你賭在哪一邊。如果有賽馬，在散塲時，你總會看到他或者是滿臉通紅，或者是興高采烈；如果有鬥狗，他也來賭；鬥貓，他也來賭；鬥小雞，他也來賭；呵，如果圍牆上落了兩隻鳥，他一定和你賭：哪一個先飛；如果這裏有集會，他是照例要賭在拍孫華卡身上，這人，他斷定是這裏的勸敎者，而且也是一個好人。如果他看到一個跨立着的臭蟲在動身到什麽地方去時，他也要和你賭：他究竟會走多遠丨丨走到他要去的無論什麽地方，而且如果你眞和分他他來，他一定要明白那臭蟲，到底到什麽地方去，路程有多遠，就是到墨西哥，他也要跟去的。這裏的許多孩子都看見過那位史密吕，而且可以告訴你關於他的事。但是這和他没有關係，他無論什麽都賭丨丨這位最危險的人物。拍孫華卡的老婆有一次病了，病了很久，而且他們似乎不能救活她了；但是一天早晨，拍孫華卡來了，史密吕起身問她怎樣了，他説，她好了許多丨丨谢谢上帝的無限仁慈丨丨因爲主的賜福，情境這麽順遂，不久她就會好的。而史密吕，還没有想，就説「不，她决不會好，我賭兩塊半錢。」</p>

<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>在過去一年中，交通部所創辦之國際無綫台，除原有電路外，計開放中英中日直逹，營業方面，顯有進展，電政收入，亦見增加。</p>
<p>新近中意通報，亦告成立，上海與羅馬間，傅遞消息，經由該台，瞬息可逹。國際無綫電台，年來籌畫與世界通信之無綫電綱，經過不少的努力，截至現在，全球重要各城市，無不有直接之電路可通，縱不能謂爲已盡能事，但其成績，亦殊値得吾人欣慰。</p>
<p>查中意通報之聲，去年卽甚囂塵上。籌備期間，比較稍久，斯胭最初試騐，結果未嘗不佳，所感缺點，卽羅馬電台之電僌稍弱，收受方面，不無影響。在開放之前，不能不逾格愼重，於是於技術上再加改良，再度試騐，迨雙方認爲圓滿，乃自上月二十一日起，正式營業，經過情形，實係如此。</p>
<p>中意通報之最初發動，不在我國而在意政府之要求，係與他處通報，情形稍異；蓋意與我國，關係較切，年來商業亦多發展，又復鑒於我國國際電台辦理海外通信，頗著聲譽，故中意通報，意方極具熱望，而經我方考慮，亦表同情，因得隨以决定。今茲實施，中意雙方之滿意，自無待言。</p>
<p>歐洲諸國，若英若法若德若俄，均莫不先後與我國電台，直接通報。羅馬爲歐南政治中心，上海爲我國通商要埠，彼此僑民，均屬不少。國際貿易，全頼電信之靈通，而政務方面，意國對我，先升便格，足見中意邦交，愈見進步。謀兩國之親善並爲我國國際無綫電業務上着想，中意通報，所關係者，不可謂非重大。茲舉出之，希國人之深加注意焉。</p>

<p>試觀右表，可知電話欠費問題之嚴重，並不下於官電欠費問題。而電話欠費之原因，除少數不肖主管人員營私舞弊者外，（自經交部嚴加整頓後此風已戢）尙有下列數點：甲·時局變遷，被欠之機關團體，已不存在者；乙·各機關團體，因主管人員前後更换，以致月租無着者；丙·軍事影響，各用户倉卒搬遷，無從徵收者：丁·商家倒閉，致無着落者；戊·機關或商家用户，雖然存在，但以經費困難或營業不振爲詞，而任意拖欠者。查甲·丙·丁·三項，係變起倉皇，用户異動，致無從徵收，但事出偶然，係臨時性質，而非永久情形，係少數用户，而非普遍現象，話局主管人員，事前應嚴密注意以妨避之，事後應妥爲設法以補救之，不得以時局變遷，而推諉責任。乙·戊·兩項，用户所持理由，殊不充足！舊機關主管人員交替，何時蔑有，連帶負責，律有明文，至於經費困難或營業不振，卽係實情，均爲該機關或商家内部之事，與話費毫無關係者也。在該機關未經取消以前，或該商家未經倒閉以前，話局自應從嚴催收，以重公帑，而用户决不能以片面理由，或他項飾詞，以爲搪塞抵頼，而置國營事業於不顧也。　　　　　　　　　　又查話用機料，多係購自外洋，價値甚鉅，用户所裝話機一具之價，自働式約六七十元，共電式約三四十元，故於裝機之時，照章應繳押機費及裝機費。此項押機費，各機關照繳者固多，而延不存付者亦復不少。甚至因時局關係，該機關人員星散，而話機亦不翼而飛。及有他種機關起而代之，需要電話設備，急於星火，當時話局旣無話機儲用，又無押機費抵補，勢必呈請交部，另購新機，公文往還，遷延時日，而需要電話之用户，見其久不裝設，深感不便，且或謾駡話局辦事不力者。蓋不深知話局因欠費纍纍，致一籌莫展之苦衷者矣。</p>
<p>電話機料，旣較電報爲昂，押機繳費，又較報費可靠，每月租金，多者不過十餘元，少者僅數元，不若報費之有一電收費至十餘元或百元之鉅者。且市内通話，不過數里或數十里之遥，而通話時間，亦絶無「特急」「限卽刻到」之冠語。此電話業務與電報業務性質之不同，而辦理繁易之有别也。故在用户方面，須體念電話事業之艱難，每月區區十餘元或數元租金，應按期照付，否則寗願拆機以免拖累。在話局方面，一面應遵照部章，嚴加催繳。一面須與用户多方接近，用口頭的或文字的將局中困難情形，和盤托出，并説明國營事業與國家人民之關係，得其同　，然後能收通力合作之效。</p>
<p>聞交通部對於電話欠費，已規定辦法兩項，令飭各局遵辦：（一）對於舊欠有着落者，應加緊催收，其實無着落者，應將户名欠費數目及有無押機等項列表呈部核辦。（二）以後收費，應嚴行照章請理，其未繳押費者，並應卽補繳，不得再有拖欠情事。自經一番整理後，電話欠費，當可告一段落，而話局收入，或有起色乎？</p>

<p>查中意通報，早有其議，惟因當初意京羅馬電臺與上海國際電臺試騐通報之後，感覺意臺所發電浪太弱，波長不及，我方所收電符不甚清晰，卽經羅馬電政當局竭力改良，增强電力，擴充設備，再加試騐，成績遂佳，音符旣清晰異常，速率又迅捷無比，遂於上月二十一日起正式開始通報，業務甚形發逹，爰書所感，以慶成功。</p>
<p>我國西洋文化之輸入，濫觴於明萬歷時意大利利嗎竇之來華傳敎，嗣後意人南懷仁湯若望於清乾隆時繼續東來，介紹天文數學等科學，同時將東方文化介紹於泰西。故中意兩大古國，實握溝通東西洋文化之權威。自去年互升大使以來，邦交更形敦睦，夫以兩國關係如此之密，而竟無直逹通信之設備，不免有美中不足之感，今兩國間電信交通已有直逹電路可通矣，行見兩國邦交，將因此而愈益親切也，此其一。以前中意間電信交通，無論無綫電或水綫電，必須轉輾傳遞，時間太不經濟，自今以後，上海與羅馬間電報可以直逹，中意兩國所屬其他各處電報由該兩處接轉，亦較以前之轉輾傳遞爲迅捷，斯於兩國之商務大有裨益者也，此其二。查中意兩國間每年所耗電報費，奚止鉅萬，此項報費，以前因無直逹電路之故，不免利權外溢，俯仰由人，有茲直逹電路之後，兩國間往來電報，均可自行辦理，不如假手於人，漏巵旣塞，國富斯充，證以近年來兩國國民國家思想之發逹，拍發電報斷無舍己芸人，自損權利之理，此於兩國電信前途玛有關係者也，此其三。有此三因，謂爲中意報務不能發逹者，未之有也丨是爲祝！</p>
<h3 id="c283">怎樣利用電報？（續） <a href="#c283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— 仲華</p>
<p>上面所説的「跟送電報，發報人往往急於要知道在什麽時候可以送妥。那末，電局也有一種便利的辦法。就是：發報人可以要求電局於送妥後，立刻用電報或郵函通知他，如用電報通知的，發報人除了在原電的收報人姓名住赴前，加一個PC字樣作爲納費標識外，祇須另外預付六個字的尋常電費。如用郵函通知的，發報人祇須預付一封掛號信的郵資，和加一個ＰＣＰ字樣作爲納費標識。有的時候，發報人爲了得不到收報人的回電，非常焦慮，那末也可以利用這種送妥通知，證明收報人確已收妥，這是很有利益的。</p>
<p>電報的内容，電局方面，向來絶對保守秘密的，故電報局按照收報人姓名住址派差投送的時候，必須收報人簽名蓋章，以免被僕役或其他關係人所拆閲，以致洩漏電文。電報局爲尊重收報人利益起見另訂有一種「面交電報」的辦法，救濟上述的弊病。這種「面交電報」，拍發手續很爲簡單，祇須加一個ＭＰ字樣的納費標識就行。在收報一端的電報局看見有ＭＰ字樣的電報，會在電封上寫明「面交」安樣，吩吩報差，必須當面送交收報人，照這樣，電報的秘密性，也就多加一層保障了。</p>
<p>有些人認爲「面交電報」還是不十分妥當，因爲收報人不能終日守在辦公室或寓所裏，那末「面交電報」，很容易躭擱很久的時間才收到　普且電局報差，除非事前有過接洽，也不能確切地證明收報人的眞僞這種事實上的困難，委實無法避免。所以電局又另外訂有一種「留交」的辦法，就是收報人自己到電局去領取，不經過報差投送的手續，那末，收發報人可以絶對地保守秘密，不再有所過慮了。這種「留交電報」，還有種便利，例如：發報人明知收報人尙未到逹或是已經他往，就可以讓所發的電報暂留收報局，聽候本人或其代表親到電局領取，以免投送不到。假使收報的地方，祇有郵局而没有電局，那末可以交該地郵局留交，郵局留交的電報，以ＧＰ字樣爲納費標識。電局留交以ＴＲ爲納費標識。倘若須交郵局掛號寄去者，須另加掛號郵資，同時改用ＧＰＲ字樣爲納費標識。</p>
<p>通信的秘密，固然很重要，但是有些塲合，並不需要保守秘密或者因爲保守秘密的緣故，反而發生種種不便。例如：甲乙兩人同在一個機關中辦事，甲循例在星期六的晚上乘車返家，因爲臨時發生事故，拍一通電報給乙，託他請假數天，恰好那天乙也有事請假，所以電報放在乙的辦公桌上無人顧問，機關中的同事，因爲尊重他們兩人間通信的秘密起見，當然也未便拆閲，所以甲的請假手續，無人替他代辦，終於受着長官的申斥。在這種情形之下，電報局又有一種「露封」的辦法，彌補上述的缺憾。所謂「露封」，就是電封並不封緘，可以任人拆閲，以便任何人看見了，可以立刻依照電文的意思去辦理，不必一定要等待收報人親自處理，這種露封電報以Ouvert字樣爲納費標識。</p>
<p>最後，記者要介紹一種「價廉物美」的特種電報，這種電報，並不由發報人直接拍發，但是直接，减輕發報人的負擔，讀者諸君都可以亨受這種特殊權利。這就是「郵匯電報」！交通部前爲减輕用電報匯欵人的電費起見，特地訂定了一種廉價的匯欵電報，不論你匯欵的數目是多少，祇要向郵政匯業局去匯欵，除了付相當的匯水以外，只須付六角大洋的電報費。國内電報，除了交際電以外，没有再比六角錢更廉的電報，這種優待的辦法，一般到銀行裏去匯欵的人所享受不到的。讀者諸君不妨一試何如？（安）</p>

<h3 id="c285">天津永增合銀號私設電台案私訴部份和解經過述評 <a href="#c285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— 地佑</p>
<p>天津永增合永立兩銀號私設電臺一案，其刑事部份審判經過，已迭誌本刊。其私訴賠償部份，除永立銀號一部尙未解决外，茲聞永增合方面已自知悔過，挽人調停，業經成立和解，茲將經過情形，略述如次：</p>
<p>本案刑事部份自經津法院判决後，天津電報局卽開始進行私訴賠償手續，狀請法院依照民訴法第四八八條四八九條將永增合永立兩銀號之現有營業收入，及一切動產准予裁定假扣押；並另行撰狀，正式提起私訴。上項假扣押正在法院法裁定中，永增合銀號卽一面挽天津市錢業同業公會致函電局，瀝陳該銀號悔過情形，情願賠償損失；一面並委託蒯晋德律師，致函津局委任律師周澤轉函津局，略稍；「永增合銀號現爲請求撤銷假扣押起見，特指定以劉朝卿户頭，在天津交通銀行於十月十一日所存之半年定期存欵兩萬元，作爲擔保金，在賠償訴訟判决確定前，或和解成立前槪不動支，如蒙准許，請由貴局在法院聲明該部份之假扣押暂時停止，僅就永立銀號假扣押部份先予定期執行，以符手續，如何之處，應請察核辦理，」等語，津局據函，以該銀號指定劉朝卿所存天津交通銀行之兩萬元半年定期存欵爲担保金，核與該銀號請求賠償數目兩萬一千元，相差無幾，此種辦法，於法尙無不合，且該銀號復挽託錢業公會出面請求和解，情訶懇摰，爲息事寗人，並保全該銀號營業信譽起見，卽慨然接受其請，據情轉呈交通部准予繳納保證金，撤銷該銀號部份之假扣押，同時並進行和解手續，結果由該銀號認繳洋一萬七千元，作爲賠償津局營業損失，遂將訴狀部份撤回，和解於焉成立。</p>
<p>查津局電信交通，極稍完備，收發電報，迅捷凖確，素爲中外人士所稍譽，乃該商號拍發電報，舍此正當完美之機關而不由，備知貪圖微利，不惜甘蹈法綱，私設電台，自經破案之後，號中員役，或畏罪逃匿，或身陷縲絏，身體精神，旣遭痛苦，營業信譽，亦受影響，而平時所有私發電報，仍須付欵賠償，損失之大，非該銀號初料所及，經茲懲創，深悔前非，私設電臺者儻亦知所炯戒歟？</p>
<p>再聞交部方面，自經此案破獲之後，對於私設電臺，取締更加認眞，業經重申明令飭由各地電信機關，隨時嚴密偵查，並由各大埠電報局登報廣告，懸賞奬勵密告，（對於告發人姓名絶對嚴守秘密）。查私設電臺小則擾亂金融，破壞市面，大則散播謡言，影響治安，甚或資爲敵用，危及邦國，爲害之大，書不勝書，尙望社會人士，共體斯旨，羣起恊助，凡耳所聞，目所見，有涉及私設電臺之情弊者，請隨時密函報告當地交通部電報局或無綫電臺，或逕報南京交通部電政司，以慿查抄，嚴申國法。想亦熱心愛國者所樂爲也。</p>
<h3 id="c286">談談兩種爲社會服務的電報 <a href="#c286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— 清華</p>
<p>電報分政務，加急，尋常，新聞，交際，公務等數種，除公務電報係電局内部因公而發，並不計費外，其餘各種電報，均一律收費，不過價目多　不同而已。此外尙有兩種電報，均係由電局免費傳遞，一爲氣象電報，一爲賑務電報。此兩種電報，前者與航航行安全均有重要關係，後者與災區賑務有關，電局特許免費傳遞，蓋有爲社會服務之意存焉！</p>
<p>惟上述兩種電報，因免費之故，不免失之冗濫，致電局不僅多耗材料，且亦擁塞電路，影響他種電報之傳遞速率。故就電局立塲言，如果發見冗濫，惟有嚴格加以限制耳。</p>
<p>先談氣象電報</p>
<p>氣象電報乃氣象機關報告氣象觀察或氣象務測之電報。國際間往來者，按照國際電報規則第七十三條之規定，應照尋常電報半價收費。國内往來者，因交部鑒於我國氣象機關之少數，且大半經濟不足，故特許免費拍發。惟近數年來氣象機關逐漸增多，除上海靑島等處原有之天文台觀象台外，現有中央氣象研究所，航空委員會，山東及江蘇建設廳所辦之　候所，山西農業專科學校等氣象機關。上述各氣象機關爲辦理氣象預測之故，須收集各地氣象觀察之報告，故拍發氣象電報之機關爲數極多，如各地海關，航空站，縣政府等，共計約有二百餘處，每日每一機關拍發氣象電報二次，共計卽有四百餘次。尙有同一機關同時發致兩個氣象機關者，電報次數更形繁多，以是電局對之，因免費之故，不免先傳拍收費電報，而後膞拍氣象電報，因此氣象電報難免有少數遲延者，而氣象機　因是表示不滿。交部最近有鑒及此，認爲氣象電報關係航行安全，旣准免費，則應迅速傳遞，俾可及時發生効力，否則到逹氣象機關時，已屬明日黄花，在氣象機關得之無用，在電局則徒耗人工材料，實屬太不經濟，惟全國氣象機關應有系統之組織，以免各自爲政。如蘇魯兩建設廳所辦之測候所，與中央氣象研究所不相聯絡，於是各處拍發之氣象電報多屬重複，卽不免於冗濫，現聞交部正與中央氣象研究所及航空委員會函商氣象通信網之組織，使氣象電報費以最小之代價，得最大之效力，庶雙方均感利便。在此項通信網未組成以前，交部已先飭各電局迅速傳遞氣象電報，並爲各收報氣象機關規定縮寫字樣，如普通氣象機關爲ＯＢＳＥＲ，航空氣象機關爲ＯＢＳＡＶ，使電報字數减少，傳遞自可迅速。同時又飭南京電報局與收報最多之中央氣象研究所接洽裝設專綫電話，以便電局收到各地發來之氣象電報時，利用電話傳送，較報差投送更形迅速，此爲電局服務之最大努力，尙望國内各氣象機關，由中央研究院出而謀一有系統之組織，並竭力减少不必要之氣象電報（指避免重複等事），則裨益於氣象觀測者當匪淺鮮也！</p>
<p>次言振務電報</p>
<p>振務電報原爲辦理臨時急振而設，凡發寄振務電報者，必須先向交通部凊發振務電報免費報照，期限至多以六個月爲限，每次發電至多不得逾一百字，限制原屬甚嚴，但年來我國天災人禍，接踵而來，以致各慈善團體及振務機關辦理振務，永無終了之期，發寄振務電報執照因之一再展期。近來振務機關更見增多，以是振務電報，日益充斥。照章振務電報應關於緊急振務爲限，如係普通不急要之振務，儘可用代電接洽，但事實上現在各振務機關動輒發電，辭句冗長，電局不僅耗費材料，且使其他收費電報大受影響，殊違免費優待之本旨！嘗考各國國内電報章程内，並無振務電報之設，初以爲歐美日本諸國災饉少見，故無振務電報之規定。但考之實際，民國十二年間日本東京大地震，爲害甚烈，當時日本慈善團體辦理急振所發電報，均照尋常電報付費，並無要求免費情事。歐美各國水災旱災亦每年有之，未聞有免費發電之辦法。再查國内鐵路局對於振務人員乘車，均收全費，運載振衣振糧，亦均付半價。郵政局對於振務函件，亦照章收費。由此可見振務電報之免費，實爲國内外之獨例，甚望各振務機關善爲利用，自動减省發電之次數字數，庶免費優待辦法不致因冗濫而有所變更也。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊</p>
<p>談言</p>
<h3 id="c288">寒假六日中 <a href="#c288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— 龍</p>
<p>在此寒假本報停刊六日中，世界的，或國内的，小而至於本埠的，其間發生變化的情形，足爲談言的資料的，當然不在少數，茲擇較有價値的數事，略爲談談。</p>
<p>一是本埠的市面，自近年以來，大有一落萬丈的趨勢，尤其是廢曆的年關，最爲緊張，在未曾過到年關的當兒，預料去年的年關，不知將發生若何不景氣的景象，但是去年年關，除幾家銀行發生小小風潮外，亦因凖備金的充足，風潮漸告平息，仍得於　鼓聲，恭喜發財聲中安然渡過了，此外進路節後，必定有許多店家開不出門，但此是後話，現且不談。</p>
<p>二是日本侵察問題，起初形勢非常緊張，嗣因外交家的努力折衝開成了一個大灘會議，察東形勢，頓見和緩，至於討論的，結果如何，我國權利的損失如何，茲亦可以不問，不過聞日軍於會議後，全部可以撤退，如是則察事也算告一段落，事件不致再形擴大，也可算爲得過且過矣。</p>
<p>三是歐洲大局問題，英日兩國，方於二月三日（卽我國廢曆除日）成立倫敦恊定，此事關係歐洲和平問題，極關重要，因爲歐洲的强國，便要算英·法，意，德，四國，而德實處於三國敵對地位·且其野心勃勃，行動乖張，人盡側目，但是英法意三國因立塲的不同，利害的互異，不能完全一致對付，現經法外相頼伐爾的努力，與意成立羅馬恊定，於英成立倫敦恊定，於是則三國共同合作，遏止强敵，則勝算可以操，故羅馬外長謂「一九三五年可謂係和平建設之重要年份矣」其意卽在於此。</p>
<h3 id="c289">流浪者 <a href="#c289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— 徐盈</p>
<p>像夏天一樣的，天色　那麽清澈，閃鑠着亮晶晶的星星。可是天冷了，行道樹脱掉了葉子，大地在精光的暴露着　渤海的風也凉了，沿着白河流進來，刺人毛孔像刀子。流浪者，没那正情倚躺在水門汀的短牆，嘴吹着無韻的調子，把心沉到黑暗的深幽處，静悄悄地數晴空上的星星。</p>
<p>寒凉的動力打消了流浪者的樂觀。東一羣，西一羣，或零零落落地，從公園，從街頭，從没有人的茶館，從那冰窖一般的客棧，慢慢地集中到閙市。都市的繁囂可以震顫着飢寒的心，那矯龍一般地年紅登稍使人體細胞觸發一絲兒温暖。</p>
<p>寒風撫摸着大地上的一切，從高樓大厦一顆細微的土粒都是一視同仁的。寒風使閙市减色，寒風使行人却步，寒風使重裘的人覺得縰然坐在汽車裏也要僵化的。寒風把半數以上的街頭行人捲到夜市去。</p>
<p>夜裏面，流浪者只好在夜市裏享受一霎時的温暖了。</p>
<p>從電燈開亮時候起，夜市便上人了。小販們也便燃着他們那盞暈黄的油燈，使他所出售的貨物都帶着一個淺淺的影子。他是無組織而又像有組織似的，每個在行上道上的小攤子都有一定的位置。夜飯的時間過了，警察便背着白布的大口袋，來收地攤捐了，這捐是以一個大銅板起碼，</p>
<p>人羣集中在這裏，這裏便有了熱，有了力，有了活氣。小飯舗特别把炒勺敲得山響，爐火噴出來映得路人臉發紅；估衣攤的啞嚨一個賽一個的呌着，像幾把失掉了松香的胡琴奏樂；賣主和買主都在提高聲音講話，等到買主走了幾步時，賣主又出了更高的聲音呌他回來，買主不肯回頭，兩個人把在一百米突的距離内再議價。</p>
<p>嘈雜中的人是多的，可是來買東西的並不多，流浪者羣是成心在取暖，有時候，也許機會好，順便　來一點錢，若是東西則手傳手的送進當舗去换錢，江湖上朋友多義氣，有錢大家吃喝，完了一哄而散。</p>
<p>夜市上，臭氣中混雜着香氣。雜貨而外，宵夜食品也是多的。冷肉攤上，大敎的則是擺着慈眉善目的整　頭，清眞的則是大塊的獸肉，黑黑地像一堆水牛糞；稀飯担子周圍是濔漫着一重薄霧，人羣是在朦朧裏來來去去。此外，羊腸子攤，餛飩攤，燒餅攤，各有各個的氣味與姿態。</p>
<p>有時候，正是弟兄們在這些攤上吃得興高彩烈。黑衣警察會同着眼線灰大褂，走進那薄霧的氣圍裏，拍着一位流浪者的肩頭説；</p>
<p>「這位弟兄，你的案子白了！」</p>
<p>這位弟兄便很自然地吃了最後一杯酒，一聲不嚮地讓别人把白繩緊在胳臂上，會意的，把有神的眼飄一飄四周，知會一下别的流浪者羣。爲什麽，江湖上的規矩。</p>
<p>若不幸，一隻手在别人口袋裏，便被人抓着胳脯，這是最不露臉的事。這時候，這人一定得死命逃，如果順了風，有人打接應，流浪者羣會阻礙了交通，人擠得到處都是，車，馬，人，嘈雜成一片時候，三隻手的捕手，也只好望洋興嘆。</p>
<p>流浪者羣，年年夜裏看月亮，如果問今年有幾個流星，他們最先知道。只是地方不同了，今年是在渤海濱，去年却在古城頭，明年呢，也許會到揚子江口吧。</p>
<p>無論是渤海濱，無論是古城頭，無論是揚子江口，只要有夜市，這一姿態總會出現的。</p>

<p>「流浪出身的孩子，是永遠不慬得任何的擊念的啊！」</p>
<p>離開了病着的媽，離開了她，離開了凋殘的故鄉，離開了夜夜的古銅色的月亮，終於，我又一次地飄出來了。</p>
<p>生活對我像特别存着徧惡，然而，却也像特别存着徧愛似的，那麽小小的年紀，當别人正給生活的母親安放在軟軟的摇床中的年代，而我却給她用了一種更奇特的眼光照燿着了，我是永永無休止地在她的懷裏扭動着的丨她使我快活，也使我悲哭；使我勇敢，也使我沮喪，她對我慈祥地微笑，也對我獰狰地瞪視：是一個没有辦法的，倔强的孩子啊。</p>
<p>不錯，自家兒挺明白：從生活的爐子裏，從荒蕪的原野裏滚過來的孩子，是不很容易妥恊，也不是十分依順的啊。</p>
<p>這可用不到自己發現，就是連親自安排我底長成的母親，和從六歲起就在一起玩泥娃娃的她，都驚奇地那麽説着了：</p>
<p>「怪哪：竟變得那麽殘酷了嗎？什麽都引不起他底依戀，什麽都賺不到他底繫念了哪。」</p>
<p>是實在的啊，都少幼年時代的依戀，沈醉，愛好，在流浪的過程中已完全化成了碎片；家的親切的調子，她底年</p>

<p>靑的笑，門前的山腰裹的茶花，古廟的雜色的屋尖，黄昏的掛在樹枝頭的太陽······就是在魂夢裏出現的當兒，也祇是呌人露　是扮一次苦臉吧啦。那麽一年一年地，我活過來了，我有了一種像浮雕那廢朦朧而扁平的知覺：我學會了用愚昧去應付一個笑，一種刺激，一次憂傷，正像用直覺來接受一座山，一條水，一堆枯枝同樣······意念是給壓扁了的，麻木了的啊。</p>
<p>於是，我明白了：我終究是幸福的我是幸福的啊。</p>
<p>有一個日子　是深秋啊，我在野外漫步，一堆枯枝的灰燼横在我的前面，我看着，又看着，幾種意象在我眼前發生了奇特的連擊：一撒種子，同叢幼芽，一排嫩枝，一片落葉，一叚殘幹，一堆灰燼丨從種子與灰燼的惨劇中，我彷彿得到了啟示：流浪的出身，流浪的結束丨我希望吹起了一陣北風，我希望看到在空中打旋的灰粒；於是，我幻想到一粒灰燼，飄浮地，無目的地，不自知地，棲息在一片驀生的土地上了：人踐踏它，人疎忽它，人遺忘它，一天天地，便那麽地給積壓到深遠的地層中去了。是自然界的悲劇啊。</p>
<p>便那麽地，我開始學會了踐酷，我學會了冷漠，我學會了自然界的悲劇的原則。</p>
<p>這樣，便連自己都有些糊塗啦：什麽是値得繫念的呢？笑嗎？太陽嗎？這流動着的小川與紫色的山峯嗎？還是人世間的不可靠的熱情的化裝，與作爲慘劇之演出的自然界呢？</p>
<p>眞的，你説，一個流浪出身的孩子，他能繫念什麽呢？</p>
<p>那麽便：忘掉了感受，忘掉了依戀，忘掉了思索，忘掉了繫念吧。在流浪的過程中，殘酷便是愚昧；而愚昧却始終是幸福的。</p>
<p>戰抖着，把一切都抛在後邊，我終於又一次地浪出來了，我記憶着一個語句：</p>
<p>「赤條條來去無牵掛！」</p>
<p>它的偉大使我發科。</p>

<h3 id="c292">想從文學上求出路 <a href="#c292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是一個十八歲的孩子，現　正生活在困苦的環境裏，我雖想向前途奮鬥，但又不知道這樣奮鬥下去，有没有成功的一天。所以特把我的現况，和前進方針告訴先生，想請先生給我一個明確的指示。</p>
<p>我自七歲起，由父親送我到一艘專航長江的帆船上去，做燒飯的工作。辛辛苦苦的做了幾年，在十三歲時，才開始當一個撑篙拉繩的船伙。在這個時期，曾數次被波浪所捲，常有失去生命的危險。</p>
<p>在十四歲時由寗波搬到上海，船伙不做了，父親供給學費，我便成爲一個學生。但一二八之後，又宣告輟學，後幸由父友的介紹，到交通部所辦不要學費的學校去讀了二年書，終算畢業了。但也是生活的困難向我進攻的時候了。我不希望再繼續求學了，因爲事實上是没有能力求學了。但我又没有事情可做。先生，我一家六七口吃飯，而我的父親不過是一個販襪的小販，我又不做事，這怎能維持下去呢？所以生活困難的情形，實在不堪設想。至於我個人却天天是賦閑，瞎跑，而最感與趣的就是到申報流通圖書館去。因爲在那裏可以不費一錢看到很多的書籍。又因爲我連一二元的保證金拿不出，所以只好天天跑到去。但是有時今天看不完的好書，明天却被人借去了，自己便不能繼續看下去，那時内心是多末的痛苦啊！當然無論如何，看了一點好書，總比一點也不看是好得多了。</p>
<p>最近我很歡喜看文學書，我拼命的看那些　中外名家的作品，同時便好像激起我心中的希望一樣，我便試騐寫作了。而爲了經濟問題，便又開始投稿了，想得到一點稿費，維持生活。但是，結果却都是一封封的退回來了，大槪是技巧太不行吧？所以我現在還要繼續努力創作，我想從文學方面抄出一條生路來。但是能不能逹到我的目的呢！</p>
<p>先生，我現在附上我的最近作品，想請你給我一個嚴正的批評，並希望你指示一點關於作文方面的方法，爲盼！專上，敬請</p>
<p>撰安　龍臣上</p>
<p>編者按：接讀來信，知道你生活上痛苦的實情，我心裏正爲你十分難過。同時，我看出你正在十分艱苦的向環境奮鬥，絲毫没有厭世或悲傷的態度，使我又覺得你非常的可佩。</p>
<p>你現在正研究文學，這是很好的；不過有一點你要了解，就是研究文學不是專爲解决個人吃飯問題的，假使僅爲了個人吃飯而努力，那文章便没有大的出息了。當然，一個人總是要吃飯的，但是，研究文學，絶不可專爲個人的吃飯設想。</p>
<p>要研究文學，單是在文學的範圍裏面研究還是不够的，一定要同時研究一點社會科學。你要明白地認識了這個社會，然後才看得清你在社會上的地位；這樣，你的文章才會有很好的内容。假使你單在文學本身或其技巧上研究，那末你的文章至多是在技巧上有一點進步，流於虚華，内容一定是不充實的。</p>
<p>你的三篇稿子，我已經看過，文字的技巧上是有了相當的成績了，然而内容上還是不够的。因此，你以後還該專在讀書和做事上下功夫，多學習些理論，多經歷些事故，内容才能漸漸的充實咧。關於投稿的失敗，你不要灰心，你還要一面學，一面寫，只要自己肯努力，則將來總有逹到成功的希望。</p>
<p>生活上的困難，在現在是一個很普遍的現象，比你還要來得困難的人，也知道多少咧，所以你不必爲了生活的壓迫，而失去前進的精神，你應繼續向環境奮鬥，則絶没有不能解决的事。</p>

<p>— 黄影呆</p>
<p>報載洛杉磯電，法院已准銀幕情侣范朋克曼麗璧克馥分居，這一事件在好萊塢一九三五年電影明星的離婚史上，是佔據着重要的一頁。我們回想起來，范朋克和曼麗璧克馥自一九二○年結婚之後，直到現在，已有十五年的同居史一般的人們都以爲這一對情侣，可以白頭偕老了。那知事有出人意外，這離婚案的主角，在十五年的中間，没有决裂，而到了暮年時節，倒會分居起來，眞所謂銀色情侣變幻無常，隨時有離婚的可能了！</p>
<p>我們如果回想起來，在這十五年中，曼麗璧克馥和范朋克，在初結婚的時期就有謡言傳出，説是他們要分居了但事後經當事人否認之後這種謡言，也就熄滅了。在好萊塢這個銀國之中，銀色情侣的分離聚合，本是動定無常，而關於結婚離異的謡言，也是每天都有傳説的，所以對於范朋克夫妻的仳離，一般的人也不過視爲一種普通的謡言而已。可是在最近的三年之中，謡傳更甚，而到了一九三五年的開始，這離婚案竟由謡傳而成爲事實了。</p>
<p>當他們結婚的時候，曼麗璧构馥和范朋克都在黄金時代；一個是電影皇后，一個是電影皇帝在電影界，她和他都是很紅的；而且他們俩都是明星中的財富。他俩結合之時，在職業上，在心弦上，都有同樣的興趣；他們都是好萊塢第一流的明星；他們在電影界，地位很穏固。他們俩都是有名譽的人，都是愛好結交朋友，都醉心於電影事業；他們的結合，豈不是合於理想的配偶嗎？這證諸結婚之後，夫婦俩臨上攝影塲之前，總要來幾個甜吻，范朋克遠出旅行，曼麗總要含涙送别，范朋克和曼麗結婚之後，十多年没有和其他女人跳舞，他們俩婚後的愛情如何濃厚也就可想而知了。</p>
<p>過去的謡傳無非是無稽之談，但在最近的三五年中，范朋克和　曼麗璧克馥又迭有離異的謡傳，而且在這幾次的謡傳之中蛛絲馬跡，我們都可看出他們的情感没有以前的融洽了。關於曼麗和范朋克的離婚，究竟爲了什麽原因？雖是傳説紛紜，但，「馴悍記」的拍攝，却是一大結癓。范朋克和曼麗璧克馥結婚以來雖已有十五年之久，但合攝的影片，祇有「馴悍記」一張，可是結果就因攝此影片，雙方主張不同，各執已見，引起了重大的衝突。此後兩人的意見，便更覺不合，而結果竟使夫婦間的愛情破裂，遂至宣告分居了。</p>
<p>這離婚案當然是由曼麗璧克馥主動，而將要走入暮年的范朋克，無論如何，總想維持他們的婚約的；因此，他和曼麗璧克复發生裂痕之後，便跑到英國去。目的無非在緩和衝突，使曼麗的氣憤會低抑下去，待他回美之日，再言歸於好，不難舉案齊眉。那知范朋克倫敦之行，却不能消除曼麗的盛怒，回美之後，雖有圈内人奔走調解，曼麗依然堅執着離婚的主張，终於在這一九三五年的幕展未久，洛杉磯的法庭，以三分鐘的時間，判决了這件離婚案的有效。從此這一對所謂理想的銀幕情侣，勞燕分飛，而過去的一切，只不過在人生上增加些回憶的資料而已。</p>

<h3 id="c298">評「新婚的前夜 <a href="#c298" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e298" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">298</a></h3>
<p>— 尤兢</p>
<p>丨巴黎映丨</p>
<p>在道外侮頻仍，民氣銷沉的時候，「新婚的前夜」給我們聽到了「戰戰戰，一齊上前綫···</p>
<p>報仇雪恨，奮勇争先」與「殺殺殺，大戰已爆發，國事垂危，快救中華」這支悲壯，雄偉，而熱烈的戰歌，乃是値得我們尋求與推荐牠的意義的。</p>
<p>可惜的，乃是由於題材的抓取與表現的手法之陳舊，不但糢糊了牠所給予觀衆的有意義之印象，而且在主要人物軍官袁星海的性格矛盾上，使觀衆疑懷，因此影響了作者所企圖與努力着該得的效果了。</p>
<p>袁星海這人的性格矛盾，在他親口所唱出的兩支歌丨湖上輕舟曲與戰歌丨中，極顯明地表現着。前者寫出他那種如西洋所謂的「朱古力糖軍官」與中國俗話所説的「吊鎯鏜軍人」的曲型：追逐女性，閙三角戀愛等。後者又説得他是那麽「抱着犧牲的决心去幹」，居然完成他那「男兒死沙塲」，「馬革裹屍」的意志。中間没有適當與充份的過程，兩個不同的個性的典型人物，前後突兀也矛盾着，正負之下，化入「烏有幻境」中去了。</p>
<p>這兒我們來討論一下「新婚　前夜」之技術方面吧。因爲牠是「全部聲白歌唱」片，那末先從配音與對白等説起：</p>
<p>説到配音，以中國有聲電影之物質與技術同受着限制的現在，音響方面有着若干缺點，原是不能過份苛求的，但所配音響之欠妥却是不可忽略的事實。比如在這「新婚的前夜」中如黎明暉剛被袁叢美追逐回家睡覺那塲　，在黎氏高架粉腿而微笑時，配着那麽不柔和的强烈音響，不知是什麽作用？這兒音響與畫面不但不能相乘而且在相損了。</p>
<p>對白方面，除了幾處不通，如把「没有人格」説成「没有資格，没有人道」等，便是不妥，如兩主角在讀情説愛時的對白，音調太没有抑揚，以致形成了生氣與吵嘴的口氣與語法。以及爲對話而對話地説來没有時間空閒的必要，對話與書面前後重複地不能起相乘相益的作用。</p>
<p>書面織接上也不免失之於滯澀，煩冗；鬆懈，如軍官對女父説他犧牲一切來愛他女兒時，門外的姑丈，樓上的女兒，四人的表情都不能作同時的，統一的不同反映，以及結婚前夜軍官與愛人，女父話别時，三張臉不能織接在一個畫面上等等。</p>
<p>全片以戰争的幾個塲面處理得較好。</p>
<h3 id="c299">評「新女性」丨丨金城 <a href="#c299" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e299" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">299</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>以前，曾經有過「三個摩登女性，」以嶄新的姿態出現於中國影壇，使中國電影開始有了新的轉變，它有着劃時代的意義，乃是人們所不能忽視的。該片的劇作者提出了三個不同的女性：一個是縱慾享樂的交際花，一個是戀愛至上主義的小有產者的女性，另一個便是女工了。這三種女性誰是最現代（Modern）的呢？劇作者很明白的指示着女工是時代的寵兒，在她身上担負起歷史的任務，而小有產者女性戀愛迷夢的幻滅，以及資本主義的交際花的縱慾享樂，那都是諷刺而咒咀了的。丨丨在這一方面説，那是一部成功的作品。</p>
<p>二年以後的現在，我們又看到了這内容和「三個摩登女性」頗爲相似的新女性了。劇作者也提出了同一時代而不同本質的三個女性：一個是向做買辦的丈夫吵着要汽車坐，和戲子勾搭的王太太，同個是女工阿英，而另一個却是有着若干程度之自覺性，而又經不起社會的折麽，在矛盾生活中自殺至死的女作家。</p>
<p>那末，在這裏誰是新女性呢？劇作者雖然盡力描寫女作家的自覺性，但是生活和意志的矛盾，到底使她自殺，到最後她雖然有着努力生活下去的信心，希望和她依人生活的姊姊一同吃苦自立，可是已經太遲了，她給時代淘汰了。而王太太的淫糜，給劇作者毒辣的諷刺着。新的女性的暗示，自然是在女工阿英身上，而主題歌的「新女性歌」也正面的説明了這一點：「新的女性，是生產的大衆；······是社會的勞工，······是建設新社會的前鋒。新的女性，要和男子們一同······不做奴隷，天下爲公！無分男女，世界大同！新的女性，勇敢向前衝！「是的，新女性的生活單純，不做戀愛夢，當韋明死後，她們踐踏着報紙上的死訊，向前猛進。</p>
<p>和「三個摩登女性」一樣，「新女性」的劇作者對於女性之羣的分析和理解乃是正確的，這對於知識婦人的敎訓，自然是很有力量的。因此，我們祇要求作品内容的充實，至於和其他的作品之主題的相同，當然不能作爲「新女性」的缺點。不過在題材方面似乎是俗套一些，以致於不能顯示作品的特殊性，面且在劇作技巧上也還不免有若干缺點，同樣也有許多非常戲劇的地方。</p>
<p>從整個的作品來估價，因着客觀環境的關係，也因着阮玲玉對於知識婦人的姿態把握得還不够深刻，而配音方面除了最後的汽笛聲有着很好的刺戟性之外，也有若干缺點，都不能使作品逹到完全成功的程度。但是我們决不能否認它是相當成熟的影片，編劇，導演，攝影，作曲，配音置景，以至於每一個演員，都是以最大的努力從事自己的工作，我們期待他們今後更偉大的成功。</p>

<p>— 羅夫</p>
<p>從舞臺恊會在金城公演的消息公佈之後，這不能不使人們覺着欣慰。在這一九三五年的開頭，由舞臺走上銀幕的人們，以及大多數上戲劇方面活動的人們，能够如此通力合作，大規模的公演，舞論如何是可以使人興奮的了。</p>
<p>以一二八爲界綫，中國電影有了新的轉變，這原因的一部份，便是舞臺人走進電影領域，使作爲一種動力而活躍着。但是另一方面話劇本身却因之沉寂起來，一方面固然因着經濟環境等關係，阻滯了戲劇的進路，而另一方面，專事戲劇的人們給電影引收了去，也是一個主要的原因。正因爲上述二原因，中國戲劇運動始終没有給觀衆充分的認識，爲的是在技術上没有可愛的成功。</p>
<p>現在，有着很好的客觀條件，海派京戲積極的没落下去了，一般影戲院常以歌舞賣座的也不能號召了，都要求着話劇上演，這對於提高話劇空氣是有很好的帮助的，於是便喊出了一九三五年是戲劇年的口號。</p>
<p>舞臺恊會第一次公演，自然是一九三五年的第一砲，廣大的觀衆們都在熱烈的期望着這一次公演能有偉大的成功。是的，我們期待着，如此人材濟濟的公演，至少在技術上應該是比較標準一點兒的活動。電影與戲劇的交流，我們預祝着他們偉大的成功！</p>

<p>大衛考伯菲而第一次看見麥得斯東先生，是在禮拜堂内。到後來，他才漸漸想起，怎樣和他相見，偏偏在那談仁説義的塲合，豈不是造化的顚倒無常。那是一個暖烘烘的夏天禮拜日。他的已寡的慈親，和仁厚的壁各德，他們的一個女僕，在一個很小的禮拜堂内，很快樂地團聚著。大衛是很快樂的，直等到他看見了麥得斯東在看他的母親。他雖是一個小小年紀的孩子，但他却已覺得那人是親近不得的。他第一次看見了他，就打了一個寒噤，緊緊地靠近了他母親的裙際，好像怕他來抓他似的。</p>
<p>他低聲向著他母親道：「媽媽，那個人，他像我動物讀本裏的一隻黑豹。」他母親連忙禁止他道：「低聲些！他是媽媽的一個朋友，快不要那樣説。」從此以後，他每次看見麥得斯東，他就想起那本書裏，使他看了心悖的那隻陰險可怖的黑豹。但是他不久就明白，他那時的害怕，還不算什麽，直等到麥得斯東來住到他和他親愛的母親的家中，那才是眞正的可怕哩。他使他時心驚胆戰。</p>
<p>他覺得有些莫名其妙，爲什麽他的母親要將他怱怱忙忙地送到車子裏，由一個巴格斯駕御著，叫他去到鴉墨司，和壁各德的親屬暂住。大衛不明白，他的母親爲什麽留在家裏不去，但是壁各德告訴他，她亦要去到她的朋友家裏住幾天。大衛接受了這個解釋，亦就儘量地亨受著這次旅行，却不知這是他在多少年之中，最後一次的得到些快樂。</p>
<p>他在壁各德家裏，却是很快樂的。和他同處的，除了壁各德之外，有漢姆壁各德的姪子，密昔司根密友，永遠是悉眉苦眼的，丹壁各德，就是老漁壁各德的哥哥。此外在大衛心目中，是覺得可愛的，還有一個小愛密柳，她常和大衛一起在海濱上玩的。但是他覺得最有趣味的，就是他們住的房子。不過那亦不能算是一所房子。那實在不過是一隻破船高高地安放在岸上，船底是向天的，頂上直立著一個鐵筒，就是屋子的烟囱。還有很美觀的小門，小窗，都是在船身的旁邊開著的。大衛心想，在平地上住在船裏，那是多麽有意思呀！</p>
<p>大衛來到鴉墨司的時候，壁各德雖然曾經告訴他，不可多問話，但是他不久已經探聽明白，那個粗魯壯健，而宅心仁慈的老漁，中一個老𩹌夫。他養著這許多人，漢姆是他弟兄的�子，愛密柳是他姊妹的女兒，密昔司根官支是他同伴的女人。這許多人的父親或是丈夫，都是死在那怒　奔騰，白浪滔天的無情的海中的。</p>
<p>但是這許多已往的慘劇，並没有沮喪大衛和愛密柳的心情，當他們在沙灘上作汗漫遊的時候。愛密柳並且告訴他，她衷心所懷想的志願，倘將來一且能爲命婦，她一定要替壁各德老伯伯買一件藍色的外衣，鑲著金剛石的紐扣。</p>
<p>最後，他的旅行期滿了，他和壁各德一定要回去見他的母親去了。他一路歸心如箭，想念著他的慈母。等到他的車子，一到家門口，他從車上一躍而下，直奔進屋子去，要看他的母親。但是他一進門，就兀然地站住了。他的母親正在屋子裏，照常地坐在那火爐旁邊的老地方，但是在那一邊坐的，却就是那隻黑豹，他在禮拜堂裏看見的那個人，麥得斯東先生。他不覺驚疑不定地看着壁各德的臉。壁各德低聲説道：「那就是你的新爸爸。」（未完）</p>

<p>Our establishment was founded in Guangzhou in the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928). In the 19th year (1930), it expanded to Hong Kong. Subsequently, preparations were made to establish a branch in Shanghai. Counting from the opening of the Shanghai branch, a year has quickly passed. We are deeply grateful for the patronage and support from all sectors of society. However, upon reviewing the various facilities of the past, we are ashamed to find many shortcomings and inadequacies. In the future, we will work harder and strive for excellence, hoping to repay the enthusiasm of all sectors. We humbly request esteemed gentlemen to offer valuable suggestions, guiding our path so that our establishment can gradually improve and achieve the scale of a proper hotel. This is not only what we colleagues earnestly pray for, but also what the future of our country's hospitality industry relies on. We respectfully present our sincere intentions for your consideration. Furthermore, we are honored to receive congratulatory messages from pillars of the party-state and prominent figures from all walks of life, adding luster to our publication. We hereby express our gratitude. Bin Yu-ru</p>
<h3 id="e2">From the Motive of Founding the New Asia Hotel to the Success of the Struggle Du Chongyuan <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Social improvement requires many people with new ideas and self-confidence to work hard from all aspects and bravely fight against the evil society!</p>
<p>Hotels are a type of social enterprise. In general, those who operate them tend to prioritize profit-seeking. Many undesirable habits in society are placed in hotels to cater to guests' preferences and profit from them. Travelers need a quiet place to rest their bodies and minds after the hardships of travel. However, based on personal experience, hotels in China, no matter where you go, are always inseparable from the three evils of opium, gambling, and prostitution. Once you enter, you are immediately surrounded by a foul and noisy atmosphere, causing you to feel extreme disgust and pain. Therefore, the impression of hotels is that they are a cesspool of dirt and filth, a source of social ills. In the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), when I was traveling in South China, I happened to stay at the New Asia Hotel run by Mr. Zhong. In such a large hotel, the attitude and spirit of both the staff and the employees were exceptionally solemn. It was quiet and silent all day long, which I had never experienced in various parts of the country. At that time, I greatly admired the owner of this hotel. Later, I met Mr. Zhong Zhun in Shanghai. According to Mr. Zhong, his motive for founding the hotel was because in a certain year, several British friends came to China to travel and asked him to recommend a truly Chinese hotel. Mr. Zhong was very embarrassed at the time, thinking about the various corrupt practices in Chinese hotels and how he could possibly introduce them to foreign friends. In the end, he managed to muddle through, but at the time, Mr. Zhong was greatly stimulated. He believed that it was understandable that China's other major undertakings were not as good as those of foreigners, but could it be that even a decent hotel could not be built? He felt very ashamed, so he gathered like-minded people and founded the New Asia Hotel in Guangdong. His purpose in running the hotel was to correct social evils, which was very different from the general hotels that specialize in profit-seeking. The hotel does not provide opium, and prostitution and gambling are not allowed. In the eyes of ordinary people, this is naturally considered too idealistic and has not been successful in practice. However, Mr. Zhong has the greatest faith in the work of improving society. At the time, he had two very resolute words that are worth commemorating. He said: "If the New Asia Hotel fails, it is not the failure of the New Asia Hotel, but it shows that Chinese society cannot be reformed. If the New Asia Hotel succeeds, it is not the success of the New Asia Hotel, but it proves that Chinese society is still curable." Now, the business of the New Asia Hotel in Guangdong is flourishing, and the New Asia Hotel in Shanghai is also holding a grand anniversary celebration. This is naturally the victory of Mr. Zhong's struggle against the evil society, and at the same time, it fully proves that the old Chinese society still has the possibility of reform. Although I am not an investor in the New Asia Hotel, I feel that people with ideas and self-confidence, no matter what kind of bad environment they are in, as long as they are persistent, they can always succeed. Therefore, on the occasion of the New Asia Hotel's anniversary celebration, I am very willing to speak a few words from a third party's point of view in the midst of my busy schedule, to introduce and promote them, and to contribute my humble feelings to comrades who are creating a new society!</p>
<p>New Asia Hotel is a great place to relax and travel.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Different from Others Liang Desuo <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>| Talking about Chinese Hotels |</p>
<p>Two years ago, I spent eight months traveling, going to various provinces in the east, south, west, and north. I have almost traveled all over. I have stayed in no less than 200 hotels. The scale may be different, but the situation inside is not much different. After staying, I forgot about them. Among them, there are four rooms with unique characteristics that have left an impression on my memory.</p>
<p>The first room: In Yongshou County, Shaanxi, on a cold winter night, I stayed at the largest inn in the area. A dirt wall surrounded the courtyard, which was where mules, horses, and livestock rested. A little further in, there was only a dirt room, | actually a dirt cave: | Inside was a dirt kang (platform bed), which was heated by burning horse manure. The dirt room didn't even have a wooden door, so I had to hang up a reed mat as a curtain. I fell asleep tired. I woke up in the middle of the night and saw the courtyard full of white snow, reflecting the cold light. It turned out that the curtain had been blown down by the north wind, and the fire in the dirt kang had long gone out. I couldn't sleep until dawn, and the next day I caught a cold.</p>
<p>The second room: In Guiyang County, Guangxi. The small boat docked at the pier, and the hotel was right there. It turned out that there were many rafts floating on the West River, with board houses built on them, which were neither houses nor boats, with a unique flavor. It was quite interesting to stay here. At night, leaning on the railing, the river maples and the fishing lights evoked the thoughts of a wanderer at the end of the world!</p>
<p>The third room: Rather than saying it is special, it is better to say that it is the most common hotel in major commercial ports, almost exactly the same. That was one night in Macau. The rooms were separated by wooden boards, and the walls were soundproof. The sound of mahjong tiles could be heard all around. The smell of foreign cigarettes wafted in from time to time. As soon as the sound of mahjong stopped, strange noises from men and women followed, keeping people awake all night. In those hotels, it is difficult to criticize prostitution, but why do they have to shout so loudly;</p>
<p>The above three rooms are relatively unforgettable hotels, but I will definitely not want to stay and learn from them again in future travels. The other room is different from the others. I think this is the kind of hotel that travelers need, that is, the New Asia Hotel in Guangzhou, because the material equipment of this hotel is enough to make our spirits comfortable and our lives comfortable. The strict management and the proper greetings make people feel a kind of cordial friendship, forgetting that they are in a temporary place. You can't get this kind of cordial feeling in any hotel. This point gave me the deepest impression and made me the most unforgettable. As for its Three No's policy, it is strictly enforced, eliminating the common problems of noise, mess, and uncleanliness in general hotels. The New Life Movement advocated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and popular in various places has been implemented by the New Asia Hotel for many years.</p>
<p>The New Asia Hotel has established branches in Hong Kong and Guangdong and has been successful for several years. Last year, it opened a branch in Shanghai on North Sichuan Road. I sincerely hope that it will set up more branches in major cities across the country in the future, establishing a new model for hotels. I think this is definitely not just my personal hope. Travelers who are accustomed to going out; have the same feeling, right.</p>
<p>Famous and Reputable</p>
<h3 id="e4">My Inclination and Contribution to the New Asia Hotel in Shanghai Cui Tongyue Canghai <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>All undertakings want to use it to generate profits, which is the same desire of people all over the world. However, where there is profit, people will compete for it, so there are those who only seek the goal and do not choose the means, and there are those who harm society and harm people for the sake of profit || until they harm the honor of the country. He always said, "If you don't do business, that's all. If you do business, how can there be virtuous people?" In recent years, I have often heard these words. Alas! I don't know how many people are willing to be buried in the cemetery from heaven. Especially those who run the hotel industry are the most, especially those who are good at dancing with long sleeves and are good at running great hotels. | | I don't want to directly reveal the name of the hotel industry here, and I don't want to directly point out how the New Asia industry believes in religion. I only ask because my hotel industry only seeks private interests, so it damages the individual morality of human beings, disregards it, damages the entire humanity of social customs, disregards it, and even hinders the evolution of human beings || It also disregards the glory of the country. Why is it worth having this great hotel industry? Why is it worth talking about morality and benevolence for those who gather huge sums of money || and operate this great hotel industry: Canghai is unworthy, and the year of ancient times has arrived. After the age of forty, I traveled to Europe and the United States and slightly investigated industrial and commercial undertakings. Do you know that the people of that country are all sages? No, are all the hotels they operate pure</p>
<h3 id="e5">Asia Hotel Asia New <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Is it flawless and debatable? No, but I know that there is an ancient motto in our country, "Guests feel at home." All the hotels they operate, regardless of size, seek the minimum limit, and there is never "disturbing the sweet dreams of travelers." I am afraid that the travelers who have traveled before and after will also believe in the same words. If you stay with private prostitutes, play poker, and make bamboo battles, late into the night, regardless of public morality, even the people below Huai would be ashamed to do it. Has a scholar or merchant ever asked about it? As for tall buildings and mansions, ladies like clouds, earth and wood are covered with brocade, and servants are dressed in official uniforms, let alone:</p>
<h3 id="e6">Shanghai New Asia Hotel Happy Together <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Although, the world is known as a big city, but it is not a disguised form of the battlefield and living hell. Shanghai is especially famous. Generally, young men and women have unstable footing, and they are gradually infected and fall into depravity and morality, which is innumerable. The hotel is even more a breeding ground for dirt and filth. If the business giants who operate this industry do not consider the big and distant, but only the small and near, do not consider commercial morality, but only consider singing, dancing and fighting, when the river is going down day by day, and the national fortune is ruined, they are still unwilling to make drastic changes and sink the boat. It is not only the reputation of the hotel industry that has plummeted, but also the end of industry and commerce:</p>
<p>Perhaps, people's desire for goodness, who is not as good as me? If it is as you say, people are drunk and I am alone, people are turbid and I am alone, goodness is goodness, but what if the business is not prosperous? What if the hotel's life cannot be lived? I have to kneel down on the ground here, and first admire and worship the New Asia Hotel in Guangdong and Hong Kong, which has set a banner. I have to bow three times and kowtow nine times here, and then admire and worship the New Asia Hotel in Shanghai today, which has set another banner. I hope that the shareholders and parties concerned of the New Asia Hotel, as well as the staff and employees, have a broad vision and recognize that the hotel is the second home of life, and Chinese hotels should set an example for guiding all industries, and boldly move towards a bright future, and even more towards breaking the traditional malpractices and moving forward. Sincerely taking Shanghai as the largest metropolis in the world today, calling out from a high place, all the mountains will respond, the wind is established, and the wise will follow. Canghai is not sensitive, and judges it with the law of cause and effect, and promotes it with the public's sense of justice. I dare to assert that it can be used to move the industry, and it can also be used to open a new model for the hotel industry. Seeing guests feel at home, and business is booming, it is especially worthy of holding the left voucher. Therefore, I offer two new poems to express my praise and blessing, and the words say:</p>
<h3 id="e7">New Asia Hotel Guests feel at home <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>I wish the New Asia's tall buildings soaring!</p>
<p>First built in Guangdong and Hong Kong: Opening a model era for the hotel industry! Re-operated in Huangpu: The model is not lonely, there must be neighbors: Great! Clouds follow the dragon, wind follows the tiger:</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>I wish the New Asia's layout is magnificent! Casting a model in Shenjiang: A happy home for guests and travelers! Hongshudao is in Kangzhuang: Sincerity in the heart must be expressed outside! Beautiful! The moon spits out brightness and the sun spits out light.</p>

<p>To Resolve the Hala-ha Temple Conflict</p>
<p>Official Meeting Location Still Under Dispute</p>
<p>Both Sides Will Raise Several Important Demands</p>
<p>Mongolian Authorities Explain the Truth of the Conflict</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to foreign sources here, Outer Mongolia has accepted the proposal of the puppet state to hold a meeting to discuss border issues. It has dispatched a team to attend the preliminary meeting, which is to be held at a certain military headquarters in the puppet state's Xin'an Province. Representatives from both sides are fiercely disputing the location of the formal meeting. Changchun insists on holding the meeting at Hala-ha Temple, but Outer Mongolia firmly demands that it be held in Kulun. If the meeting is held in the future, the puppet state plans to make two demands: 1. Compensation for losses; 2. A guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again. As for an apology, since Outer Mongolia is unwilling to discuss this matter, it will not be mentioned for the time being. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to news from Changchun, the commander of the Northern Xing'an Province Defense Army and the Outer Mongolian authorities have begun preliminary negotiations to resolve the Hala-ha Temple conflict. It is reported that both Japan and Mongolia will make several important demands at the beginning of formal negotiations, including compensation and guarantees that there will be no more border disputes. The Mongolian side now proposes to hold the meeting in Kulun, but the "Manchukuo" side insists on holding it at Hala-ha Temple. The Kwantung Army Headquarters also insists on holding the meeting at Hala-ha Temple, saying that the border has already been sealed off, making it difficult to hold it in Kulun. (6th Reuters Dispatch) Kulun The Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the Mongolian People's Republic, Genden, made the following statement to a TASS reporter here: "After the incident in the Halha-hin-Sume district on January 24th, there was a period of silence for several days. At 8:00 AM on January 31st, Mongolian troops stationed at Lake Baikal suddenly saw a convoy of military trucks from the Manchurian territory, carrying soldiers and accompanied by fifty cavalrymen. The team immediately occupied Gu-xi-er-Ao-bu (transliteration) and further invaded Mongolian territory. To avoid bloodshed, the Mongolian border guards retreated slightly within Mongolian territory, entering the trenches of No-lie-Nuo-er. This peaceful and restrained attitude ultimately completely avoided a conflict with the invading troops. Neither side fired a single shot. To explain its illegal actions, the Manchurian authorities have widely announced to the world that the Halha-hin-Sume area belongs to Manchuria. At the same time, to make various groups believe that its actions are legal, it has declared that it has proposed negotiations to the Mongolian side to resolve the boundary issue in the area. The Mongolian authorities, considering that the Halha-hin-Sume area has historically belonged to Harha Mongolia, are also willing to conduct these negotiations with the Manchurian government," he said. (5th TASS Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Newspapers here have widely published the speech of Genden, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the Mongolian People's Republic. Genden cited various documents held by the Mongolian government to confirm that the Halha-hin-Sume area and its surrounding areas belong to Mongolia and have never belonged to Barga. "We absolutely cannot agree with the seizure of Halha-hin-Sume by the Japanese and Manchurian troops, as this is an invasion of the Mongolian border and the seizure of a portion of our country's territory. However, in order to restore Mongolian rights peacefully, the General Command, in accordance with the general policy of the Mongolian government, has ordered the border guards not to fire on the Japanese and Manchurian troops invading Mongolian territory and to retreat to a certain front line. Japanese and Manchurian newspapers have repeatedly falsely claimed that they are obviously seeking a peaceful resolution to the January 24th incident, but the Mongolian authorities have never accepted or ignored their proposals. In fact, the agencies of the Mongolian government have never refused to meet with special envoys from the Manchurian authorities or to accept formal documents from the Manchurian side. The Mongolian government will never oppose negotiations with the Manchurian side to prove that there is no basis for any party to seize the area," he said. (5th TASS Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Outer Mongolian government authorities issued a statement regarding the Halha incident, stating that the Halha Temple has historically been Mongolian territory, etc. The Army authorities, regarding this matter, insist that the actions taken by the "Manchukuo" government are justified, and express their views as follows:</p>
<p>1.  It is not known on what basis it is said that the Halha Temple and its surrounding areas have historically belonged to Mongolian territory and have never belonged to Hulunbuir, etc. However, "Manchukuo" firmly believes that it is its territory. 2. An investigation into the Halha Temple incident reveals that the problem arose on January 8th when Outer Mongolian troops invaded the area and drove out the "Manchukuo" [security team]. However, the "Manchukuo" side was extremely eager to resolve the case peacefully, demanding that the Outer Mongolian troops withdraw automatically. On January 23rd, when the "Manchukuo Army" and a unit of the Kwantung Army, which went to negotiate, reached a point ten meters away from the Hala-ha Temple, the Outer Mongolian troops suddenly opened fire all at once, daring to kill one of our army officers and one soldier. The Kwantung Army still wants to make every effort to resolve this illegal behavior peacefully. 3. As a result, negotiations were proposed to the Mongolian government, but the Outer Mongolian side refused. If the Mongolian government refuses the fact of the proposal, then it is the Outer Mongolian officials in the area who arbitrarily refused the proposed negotiations. This is clear evidence that the orders of the Outer Mongolian government have not yet reached the border areas. 4. The Halha Temple area is indeed the territory of "Manchukuo". In order to determine the national boundaries of the other areas, if the Outer Mongolian government acknowledges the proposal made by the "Manchukuo" government, it would be extremely effective in avoiding future disputes. (6th Japan United Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Changchun) According to a confirmed report from the Halha side, regarding the aftermath of the Bo-yi-er-Nuo-er incident, the "Manchukuo" side handed over its opinions to Zha Gang on the 3rd to be conveyed to the Outer Mongolian side. The Outer Mongolian Halha captain replied at 3:30 PM on the 4th as follows: I am ordered by the Outer Mongolian government to negotiate with you regarding the border issue. The official negotiation documents can be submitted to you on the 5th. It is reported that the negotiation location is expected to be Hala-ha Temple. (5th Japan United Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e46">On Anglo-French Talks and Coordination - Heng <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>That the Anglo-French talks would quickly succeed was anticipated by commentators long ago. This is because, first, the British desire for peace in Europe is no different from the French. Second, the enemy in the British mind is Germany, not France. Baldwin's statement that Britain's frontier is on the Rhine reveals his intentions. Third, after the Saar issue was resolved, Britain's Eden hoped that all countries would take further action to lay the foundation for the European situation. As for the French side, it also considers alliance with Britain a necessary condition. If Britain cooperates with France, then concerns on the Western European side can be completely dispelled. Therefore, regardless of how successful French diplomacy is and how many countries are allied, alliance with Britain is still the key to controlling Germany. Given these points, the coordination between Britain and France is a natural result and not surprising.</p>
<p>Looking at the results of the current Anglo-French talks based on foreign dispatches, there are three main points: 1. Establishing a "Sky Pact"; 2. Addressing the Central European issue, with Britain agreeing to the Rome Accords; 3. Addressing disarmament issues in accordance with the Five-Power Declaration of 1932. The "Sky Pact" is to compensate for the shortcomings of the Locarno Pact and ensure peace in Western Europe. In recent days, air warfare has been developing rapidly. Britain and Germany are separated only by a narrow strip of water and are vulnerable to attacks. France and Germany are even more at risk due to their close proximity. This Anglo-French plan is no less than a disguised form of air force cooperation. The Central European Pact, based on the Rome Accords, aims not only to guarantee the independence of Austria but also to maintain the status quo in Central Europe. Britain's agreement on this will turn the precarious situation in Central Europe from danger to safety. The disarmament issue, in accordance with the Five-Power Declaration, means seeking equality in armaments without jeopardizing the security of each country. It also means that if Germany wants to increase its armaments, it must do so on the condition of joining the above two pacts and returning to the League of Nations. Therefore, future issues on the European diplomatic stage will inevitably focus on these points. Furthermore, if the Five-Power Declaration is used as a basis for discussion, then Austria, Hungary, etc., also have the right to rearm. In this way, although peace in Europe will be strengthened due to the conclusion of various pacts, the quantity of armaments will greatly increase.</p>
<p>Since the Anglo-French talks have yielded such results, the problem from now on lies with Germany. According to yesterday's European dispatches, Germany is quite satisfied with the results of the Anglo-French talks and has also expressed a willingness to discuss the Central European Pact. From this, it seems that Germany has abandoned its former concept of relying solely on military force and is seeking international coordination. If there are no changes along the way, Germany's return to the League of Nations is within expectations. However, there are still many conflicts between Germany and France, and full coordination may require a long period of negotiations and compromises.</p>
<p>Over the past year, Europe has been fraught with danger, with ominous clouds gathering and numerous tragedies occurring, far exceeding those on the eve of the Great War. The amount of ammunition stockpiles is also no less than in those years. Therefore, those who care about current events are all alarmed, believing that a second world war is about to break out. Unexpectedly, the crises have repeatedly been averted, and by today, the European situation has largely stabilized. The contradictions and conflicts between European countries have also decreased. The most notable examples are the improvement of relations between France and the Little Entente with Russia, the elimination of the Franco-Italian conflict, and the reconstruction of Anglo-French coordination. Therefore, although the past year has been the most dangerous time for Europe, in reality, it has been a period of transformation from danger to safety in the European situation.</p>

<p>(Geneva) The 69th session of the administrative body of the International Labour Bureau began on January 29th and closed on February 2nd. My representative, Li Pingheng, was absent, and Bao Huaguo represented. In an important closed-door meeting held today, after the discussion, a Central News Agency reporter was told that the agenda of this session was extremely heavy, with a total of 18 proposals. Among them, two were particularly important in relation to China. One was the issue of the eight seats for the world's major industrial countries. After the United States and the Soviet Union joined the International Labour Organization, they should be given important permanent seats in the administrative bodies. Therefore, the International Labour Organization has re-selected the eight major industrial countries. The selection criteria used this time are: (1) the total number of people actually residing; (2) imports and exports; (3) the annual dues borne to the League of Nations; (4) industrial activity. It is found that the above four listed standards are more favorable to China than those set in 1922. However, there are a total of 62 member states of the International Labour Organization, and experts have compared only 20 for selection. The Chinese representative in the meeting advocated supporting the selection criteria but did not agree with the comparison method adopted. After fierce debate, the proposals put forward by the Chinese and other government representatives were finally passed. The second was the selection of the agenda for next year's general meeting. Because next year's agenda is too heavy, a part of the proposals must be removed. Among them, the proposal submitted by the Chinese representative in 1933 regarding the seeking and placement of immigrant workers was also under discussion as to whether it should be removed. The Chinese representative and representatives of some governments and workers all advocated including it in the agenda, but the employer representatives and most government representatives were afraid of insufficient time and advocated making it a backup. It has been passed by the meeting, it is said. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 5th)</p>

<p>Annual payment of forty-two units starting this year</p>
<p>All arrears from the previous four years are completely waived</p>
<p>Past arrears are amortized over thirty years</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Chinese government, due to financial and economic difficulties and frequent disasters over the years, specifically requested the League of Nations to reduce its membership dues and waive the accumulated arrears year by year. This request was reviewed by the Fourth Committee of the League of Nations General Assembly last year and handed over to the Secretariat of the League of Nations for handling. Now, the League of Nations Expenditure Allocation Committee and the Special Committee for Organizing Arrears of Membership Dues, established by the Secretariat, unanimously resolved that from 1935 until a new chapter is drafted for the membership dues, China will pay 42 units of membership dues each year, with each unit amounting to 30,294 gold francs and 65 centimes. As for the arrears from 1931 to 1934, they will be exempted. The old arrears from previous years before 1930, which were organized by the agreement established in 1930, will be paid off in 30 years starting from 1935, it is said. Sixth Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>Soviet Russia has the right to protest</p>
<p>(Moscow) According to a Japanese news agency, the Japanese authorities believe that the Soviet Union has no right to raise the issue of the strength of the Japanese garrison in Manchuria. Izvestia commented on this, saying, "The Soviet Union's automatic abolition of the rights conferred upon it by the Treaty of Portsmouth has not deprived that constraint of its power to bind Japan. Tokyo seems too vague about this obvious truth. It should be known that the Soviet Union cannot grant Japan any new rights, and at the same time, it will never allow Japan to relax its obligations under the Treaty of Portsmouth (further confirmed by the Sino-Soviet Beijing Agreement of January 2, 1925). The fact that the Soviet government is unwilling to station troops on the Chinese Eastern Railway does not give Japan any right to station troops in Manchuria several times larger than allowed by the Treaty of Portsmouth," it said.

<p>Implement independent armament after the naval conference breaks down</p>
<p>Does not hesitate to compete with the United States in building ships and increasing defenses</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At the fourth subcommittee meeting of the budget this afternoon, Naval Minister Osumi explained the attitude of the Japanese Navy in response to questions from various members. The summary of his responses is as follows: In the initial naval reduction negotiations, Japanese representative Vice Admiral Yamamoto presented the figures of the tonnage held by various countries to the British representative in a private meeting, but this was Vice Admiral Yamamoto's private proposal and did not show the actual tonnage that Japan wanted to build. However, if the naval reduction conference breaks down, we originally wanted to establish an independent armament plan, but it has not yet been started. Also, regarding the Pacific defense issue, if the United States builds air and naval bases in the Aleutian Islands, Japan will expand its armaments in Taiwan and other places. The United States is now starting to build battleships, and Japan is scheduled to retrofit battleships and aircraft carriers next year (from April this year to March next year), and retrofit some auxiliary ships the following year, it is said.

<p>(Washington) The United States will soon hold a World Cotton Conference in Washington. It invited Brazil to send a delegation to participate last week, and now it has informally invited Britain to invite India and British Sudan to send representatives to the meeting. Senators from the cotton-producing states in the southern United States advocate finding ways to remedy the situation of the American cotton industry and insist that the government choose one of the following two methods: (1) Require other cotton-producing countries that compete with the United States to reduce production; (2) Or abolish the measures to reduce domestic production. Most senators even demand that the American cotton industry implement a dumping policy to make other cotton-producing countries submit. In 1933, the combined cotton planting area of Brazil, India, and Egypt was 10,100,000 hectares, while last year it was 11,300,000 hectares.

<p>Göring Will Be Ordered to Visit London</p>
<p>Discussing the Sky Pact Plan</p>
<p>The Modalities of Establishing Regional Pacts Await Questioning</p>
<p>(London) The agreement reached between Britain and France this time is of great help to European peace. Today, the French and German governments are paying attention to this move. German leader Hitler, Foreign Minister Neurath, and other important officials held an emergency political meeting to discuss this matter for a long time. After the meeting, no official announcement was issued. Roughly, Germany's second step will be to have the German ambassadors to London and Paris raise some questions regarding the actual meaning of certain items in the London proposals. Hitler had originally scheduled to meet with Archbishop Mueller today, but the meeting was temporarily postponed due to the convening of the emergency political meeting. The atmosphere in Paris discussing this agreement is completely different from that in Berlin. Premier Flandin and Foreign Minister Laval were sincerely congratulated by cabinet members. President Lebrun also praised them greatly, saying that the London talks had achieved gratifying results. Flandin explained the London proposals in the Chamber of Deputies today, saying that the agreement between the two sides would never interfere with the League of Nations' efforts to establish a universal disarmament treaty. The agreement between Britain and France, in short, is to deal with issues concerning Germany's rearmament, and involves the maintenance of Austria's independence and territorial integrity, the Sky Defense Pact, and Germany's return to the League of Nations, it is said. (Reuters dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(London) According to the report of Sir Phipps, the ambassador to Germany received by the government, Germany will be able to submit a response to the joint proposal of Britain and France to the countries concerned after half a month. (Havas dispatch on the 5th) (Berlin) The Berlin correspondent of the Daily Mail now believes that if British Foreign Secretary Simon and Lord Privy Seal Eden do not come to Berlin, then Prussian Governor General Göring will go to London in his capacity as Minister of Aviation to discuss with the British government the plan to conclude a Sky Defense Pact contained in the recent British-French agreement. This matter is currently under consideration by the Berlin government. (It is said that Simon and Eden's visit to Germany has been denied by British officials.)</p>
<p>(Havas dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The cabinet held a small group meeting, chaired by Hitler, to study the declaration issued by Britain and France after the end of the London talks, in order to determine the meaning of the various possible ways contained therein. German political figures seem to have an attitude that is not as optimistic today as it was yesterday, but they all admit that before Britain and France issued the declaration, the ambassadors of the two countries to Germany informed Berlin of its contents, which shows that the two countries did not want to create a fait accompli first and then ask Germany to recognize it. In general, it is believed that the spirit of cooperation expressed in the London declaration, if it is to be translated into reality, must be negotiated, but in order to determine the outline of this negotiation, it is necessary to hold long-term negotiations in the diplomatic field. German figures have raised some objections to the proposal to conclude a Sky Pact, saying that Britain and France are asking Germany to sign a Sky Pact, which assumes that Germany has an air force. However, it should be known that "Germany is bound by the Treaty of Versailles and does not have an air force." In addition, the question of regional pacts (Danube Pact and Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact), what status will they have within the scope of the future general agreement, and the right to equal armament, which is only proposed in principle without concrete explanation, in what form will it be realized within the scope of the general disarmament treaty in the future, are all questions that Germany wants to hear in detail. Therefore, regarding the various methods mentioned in the British-French statement, the German government will soon raise questions to Britain and France. (Havas dispatch on the 5th)</p>

<p>Premier Explains the Importance of the Air Defense Pact</p>
<p>(Paris) This afternoon, the Chamber of Deputies discussed the results of the recent British-French talks. Premier Flandin replied to the question of Socialist member Léon Blum and issued a declaration, saying that France has no intention of abandoning the League of Nations on various international issues. The purpose of the London talks is only to consolidate European peace and to express the complete common opinion of the two governments on peace organizations. Although an international security organization is not available without an international defense organization, air raids are the most worrisome for security. Therefore, Britain and France both agree to conclude a regional pact to provide mutual assistance in the air when necessary. The French side advocates expanding the scope of this Sky Pact, and all Western European countries that are willing to have peace should join this pact to jointly avoid the danger of the sky. However, after the British and French governments decided to invite Germany, Italy, and Belgium to hold negotiations first, it was because these three countries and Britain and France are the signatories of the Locarno Treaty. If they are asked to sign the pact, it is not to increase new constraints, but only to make the actions stipulated in the Locarno Treaty more resolute and faster to implement. Moreover, this kind of action is not punishment, but a warning. When a dispute occurs, once the countries with air forces express cooperation to jointly defend peace, the dispute can be resolved through negotiation without hostile actions occurring. Flandin continued, saying that the British and French governments will hold consultations again after receiving replies from the countries concerned. In short, we deeply hope to build a new dike that is more effective than the old one, so that all attempts to endanger peace will fail. This is the gist of the British-French talks this time, it is said. After Flandin's speech, there was a big applause in the whole place, and the discussion ended. (Havas dispatch on the 5th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Regarding the point in the British-French agreement that advocates abolishing Part V of the Treaty of Versailles (i.e., the military clauses), it is now heard that the British government has inquired of US Ambassador Bingham about the attitude of the US government. However, according to the State Department, it has not yet received any official report from Bingham, it is said. According to the post-European War, the United States and Germany separately concluded a peace treaty, and included all the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles. Now, if this clause in the Treaty of Versailles is to be changed, then the consent of the United States should be indirectly sought by Britain and France. Generally speaking, this move is to promote the conclusion of a disarmament treaty, so there will be no difficulties on the part of the US government. However, this matter cannot be discussed until the Berlin government replies, it is said. (Havas dispatch on the 5th)</p>

<p>Observations of New Yorkers</p>
<p>(New York) According to those familiar with diplomatic situations here, the most important feature of the British-French coordination is the Air Defense Mutual Assistance Pact. This Air Defense Pact indicates that Britain has gradually become suspicious of the increasing German aviation power. It is deeply believed here that Britain has had to effectively abandon its policy of avoiding involvement in continental disputes. Observers believe that since the European War, Britain has always refused to guarantee France to give it assistance in wartime, and France has been demanding this guarantee for fifteen years. By this point, Britain began to grant the guarantee because of the increasing danger of Germany, it is said. (National News Agency dispatch on the 5th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) The "Evening Eight O'Clock" newspaper commented on the proposals made by Britain and France, demanding that the clauses in the Treaty of Versailles regarding the demilitarization of the Rhine River (the area 50 kilometers wide on the right bank and the entire left bank) be abolished. It said that the demilitarized zone is not important in military terms, but it concerns German sovereignty and cannot be left unchanged for a long time.

The Italian Daily newspaper said, "The results of the London talks have made the Rome Agreement between Italy and France even stronger. Italian-French cooperation has expanded to become Italian-French-British cooperation. Italy now hopes that Germany will participate directly, so that the scope of cooperation can be expanded to four countries." The newspaper mentioned the issue of the military clauses in Part V of the Treaty of Versailles, saying that Italy supports the movement to amend the treaty, but rejects those who seek to amend the treaty through unilateral actions. If the military clauses in the Treaty of Versailles are abolished, then Austria and Hungary also have equal rights, which cannot be denied. This is also the main point of cooperation among the Danube countries, it is said. The "Stampa" newspaper commented on the plan for the Sky Pact, saying that its nature is more progressive than the Locarno Pact. "Il Popolo d'Italia" warned Germany, saying that the various agreements in London and Rome will not be overturned even without Germany's participation, which is what Germany should understand, it is said.

<p>(Moscow) Izvestia commented on the British-French agreement, saying, "First, the London agreement does not stipulate that Germany's return to the League of Nations can reopen talks on the legalization of German armaments. On the contrary, London has decided that Germany has no right to unilaterally cancel the armament clauses of the Treaty of Versailles. The London compromise decision allows this decision to be changed, but its provisions cannot be considered accurate, because it does not mention the negotiation procedure, and does not stipulate the exact obligation to conclude an Eastern Regional Pact in accordance with the method proposed by the Soviet Union. The French press, which received news from the French delegation, said that these decisions were sufficient to prove that if Germany refused to join the Eastern Regional Pact, then German armaments could not be legalized. If this interpretation of the London compromise proposal is correct, then this compromise can indeed strengthen the position of France and all friends of peace. The London agreement also proposed to conclude a Western Regional Pact, including France, Britain, Belgium, Italy, and Germany. However, it is not appropriate to regard this as a "Aviation Locarno Pact," because in the Locarno Treaty, Italy, Belgium, and Britain are responsible for helping France if Germany attacks France, and helping Germany if France attacks Germany. This pact includes all war preparations, so there is no need to make a special agreement on air strikes. However, according to the new London proposal, if France, Britain, and Belgium encounter a conflict between Italy and Germany over the issue of Austria, and Italy suffers an air strike by Germany, then they must assist Italy. Similarly, if France encounters an air strike by Germany in Britain, then they must assist Britain. This is the new case of the so-called Western Regional Pact. This proposal can be said to be a loss for France, because the Locarno Treaty has already stipulated that if Germany attacks France, then Britain and Italy must come to France's aid. The new addition to this pact is that France must assist the former when Britain and Italy are in conflict with Germany. This proposal is a major new political event, and we should pay attention to whether Germany will also use the weapons it has been accustomed to using in opposing the Eastern Regional Pact. If we pay attention to the German press's reaction to this case, it will be very meaningful. They will surely be mesmerized by the singing in the Four Powers Pact theater, but in general, the London agreement has clearly told Germany that its armament rationalization cannot succeed without agreeing to the work of consolidating peace in Eastern, Western, and Southern Europe. "As for the Soviet Union, it must observe the results of the London negotiations with the greatest calmness. Soviet diplomacy, on the one hand, is based on the protocol signed with France on December 5, and on the other hand, is based on the support of the Little Entente and the Balkan Entente, and must continue to strive for peace. We firmly believe that peace is indivisible. If there is no peace in the East, then the traces of peace will not be in the West," it is said. (TASS dispatch on the 5th)</p>

The government also granted it tax-free rights for exporting oil production and its by-products and importing machinery. Recently, the Mexican government issued an order accusing the company of not enjoying de facto patent rights, and said, "All activities of the company have made important national resources private, which endangers Mexico's development." The previously granted transfer rights and tax-free rights should be revoked, it is said. (Havas dispatch on the 5th)</p>

<p>A fee of four jiao is charged per parcel outside the pass.</p>
<p>The maximum amount for drafts is one thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Tianjin Communication: Postal communication between inside and outside the pass has been open for more than two weeks. During these two weeks, apart from the Shanhaiguan Transfer Bureau, which experienced a bombing on the 16th of last month at 6:30 PM, the operations of the responsible handling agencies have been relatively smooth. On average, more than 30,000 items are sent daily from the Tianjin post office to Shanhaiguan for transfer, and more than 5,000 items are transferred via Gubeikou. Among them, Western newspapers average around 2,000 items per day, and postal items from the Northeast reaching foreign countries in Europe and Asia consistently number around 300. When postal communication was initially opened, the Hebei Postal Administration issued a notice stating that items with false organizations or place names written on the envelope would be refused delivery and returned to the original sender. If they could not be returned, the county bureau would hold them for collection. Chinese senders were able to comply and actively avoided writing false organization or place names. Western senders, if it was unavoidable, often wrote "Manchuria" instead. Only the Japanese and Koreans, in an attempt to force us to practically acknowledge the puppet organization, deliberately submitted letters with the titles of false organizations or false place names and, fearing that we would refuse delivery, prominently printed in Japanese newspapers that our post office was deliberately delaying and obstructing communication for foreigners. To clarify the truth, the Hebei Postal Administration issued a notice refuting the false accusations. Previously, the Japanese Kwantung Army, because our post office refused to accept letters with the titles of false organizations, had protested to us through Iga Seiya, the chief of the Shanhaiguan Special Affairs Agency. After Yin Tong and Tao Shangming discussed remedial measures with Iga, it was decided that after postal items destined for outside the pass arrived at the Huitong Transfer Bureau, they would be handed over to the puppet South Suizhong Post Office. When they were transferred from the Gubeikou Huitong Transfer Branch to the puppet South Luanping Post Office, the place names on the mailbags could be altered, and the names of the puppet organizations could be written separately. Iga then went to Changchun to report this matter. It is not yet known whether the Japanese Kwantung Army is satisfied with this arrangement. As for remittances and parcels, the Hebei postal area had prepared everything properly and implemented them on February 1st. The parcel postage fee is slightly higher than before the suspension of postal service, with a fee of four jiao charged for each item sent from outside the pass to Yukou as the final destination, with additional fees for overweight items. Items sent from Yugu to our interior are charged according to our postal rates. Settlements are made every three months, with the Huitong Transfer Bureau responsible. According to Cao Jianting, the head of the Hebei postal service, "After the implementation of remittances and parcels, the expected boom will be in February and early March. However, as the names of the puppet post offices for parcels and remittances are all different from before, it is no longer possible to strictly adhere to the policy of not using puppet organization or agency names. After the opening of postal communication, postal items from outside the pass are handled poorly by the puppet organization and delivered very slowly. Therefore, the section outside the pass is more delayed than postal items within the pass. Those who do not know the truth believe that there is a backlog within the pass, which is not the case." In the Shanhaiguan Huitong Transfer Bureau bombing case, on the 18th of last month, the Shanhaiguan Public Security Bureau arrested eleven suspects, but there was no conclusive confession. On the 27th, a student named Zhang was arrested in Qinhuangdao, admitting that out of patriotic jealousy and hatred, he had contacted his comrades to throw the bomb. There are still two others, one hiding in Ping and one hiding in Qinhuangdao. The Public Security Bureau has dispatched personnel to arrest them separately.</p>
<h3 id="e85">General Accounting Period, Guangzhou's Market is Depressed <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce petitions the Provincial Government for Relief</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: The market's depression recently is unprecedented in recent years. In previous years, several days before the lunar New Year's Eve, business accounts were busy settling, and all goods sold well. This year, it is the opposite. Many stores in the city have closed down, and the purchasing power of the people has been greatly reduced. In previous years, at the end of the year, the flower markets on Jianglan Street in the west of the city, Shiqipu, and Shuangmendiqnei in the city, with their campanula flowers, narcissus flowers, chrysanthemums, and plum blossoms, bloomed brilliantly and lined the roads, making it dazzling. Citizens chose the best ones to buy, displayed them for events, and adorned the peace. This year, the situation has changed. The above-mentioned locations have sparse floral arrangements, and there is no longer the grand scene of previous years. During this accounting period for merchants, hardly one in a hundred can overcome the difficulties. Therefore, they are mutually implicated and running around to arrange things, but there is no solution. The Economic Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce held a meeting yesterday to discuss measures to relieve the market. The chairman declared on the spot that in this urgent and declining year, the city's finances are depleted, the money market is extremely tight, and several merchants go bankrupt every day due to insufficient turnover. If relief is not urgently sought, the future of Guangzhou's business community will be unimaginable. It was decided to submit a presentation to the government, requesting that the provincial and municipal banks accept commercial warehouse receipts as much as possible so that merchants can turn over cash. At the same time, the government is requested to postpone the collection of merchant debts. As for the settlement of accounts for each store, if the debtor is indeed unable to pay due to business difficulties, accommodation should be provided. In the event of a dispute, the government is also requested to instruct the public security bureaus and branches to properly mediate in order to stabilize commerce and maintain the overall situation. Finally, it was resolved that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce would present to the Provincial Government and the Finance Department, requesting permission to handle the matter in accordance with the above-mentioned situation, and the presentation was drafted and submitted immediately. The original text is as follows: "Presenting for the purpose of petitioning. This Chamber has approved the second meeting record of the Economic Design Committee, which states that Committee Member He Shaohai proposed, 'Now that the Lunar New Year is approaching, the city's commercial financial turnover is difficult. How should it be relieved? Please make a public decision on the case.' It was resolved: (1) Please instruct the provincial and municipal banks to accept commercial warehouse receipts as much as possible to facilitate circulation. (2) The government should postpone the execution of all debt collections from merchants for one month after the Lunar New Year to relieve commercial difficulties, etc. Please forward the matter to the authorities for handling. In view of the fact that commercial transactions are settled at the end of the lunar year, and at this time, the economy is depleted and turnover is difficult, and those who urge the collection of debts are coming one after another, making it impossible to cope, bankruptcies and escapes are more common than usual. Regarding the method of relieving finances, this Chamber has already issued commercial warehouse receipts, and recently the payment of security deposits for use has been waived. Many merchants and people are happy to accept them. If the provincial and municipal banks are accommodated in accepting them, circulation will be easier. As for the current state of the city's finances, it is urgent to maintain it. It seems that the public debts of various merchants should be postponed in order to relieve commercial difficulties, which is also in line with the spirit of cooperation between officials and people. It is reasonable to present this petition to your government and department for examination. We respectfully request that you approve it as requested and order the provincial and municipal banks and all subordinate agencies to comply, in order to provide relief. We will await your instructions and comply. It is for the public good." (January 31)</p>
<h3 id="e86">Serious Rice Famine in Huizhou Prefecture, Southern Anhui <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Harvests Sharply Reduced, Source Cut Off</p>
<p>Huizhou Communication: The counties of Huizhou Prefecture in southern Anhui are located in remote mountainous areas with little arable land. Local grain production has never been sufficient to feed the people, and most of it has relied on Wuhu, Taiping, Yicheng, Jingde, Raozhou, and other ports. Last year, rice fields in various counties suffered from a widespread drought, and the harvests were sharply reduced. In addition, there was a limited surplus of grain in neighboring areas, or even a ban on exports, cutting off the source, resulting in the current rice famine. Although the special commissioner's office and local authorities in various counties have sent numerous telegrams to the provincial authorities and Shanghai, and Chinese and foreign gentry and merchants have jointly raised funds for relief, the cost of purchasing and transporting grain is considerable. With little porridge and many monks, poor and hungry people are still difficult to benefit from it. The future famine is becoming increasingly serious. The famine situation in each county is explored and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Qimen: This month, Qimen County is experiencing a complete panic in public food supplies due to the cut-off of grain sources from Jingdezhen River and Jiangxi. Rice prices have soared to five or six sheng per yuan, and there is nowhere to buy it. Flour prices have also soared and there is a shortage in the market. Most of the poor people cook only once every two or three days, half eating sugar powder and vegetables to fill their stomachs. Although the local authorities have distributed 1,000 dan of disaster relief grain, they have not yet sent staff to receive the distribution, and the cries of pain are everywhere. Hoping for the distribution and a quick relief, they are eagerly awaiting food and are extremely keen.</p>
<p>Yi County: Yi County suffered a catastrophic drought last year, and the autumn harvest was very small. The county's grain production is not enough to maintain the supply for one month. The county relies solely on grain transportation from Taiping and other counties for assistance. Recently, due to bandit troubles that have just been quelled, grain merchants from Taiping have not entered the county for a long time. The rice in the city and rural rice shops that should be on sale has been bought and supplied as military food due to the passage of soldiers. As a result, there is no rice on the market in the city recently, and the price of rice has soared to more than 14 yuan per stone. Ordinary poor households have nowhere to buy rice every day and can only fill their stomachs with flour, sweet potatoes, and other miscellaneous grains. Soon there will be a shortage of food.</p>
<p>Jixi: Jixi County has always been known as a rice-producing area, and in previous years there was still surplus grain that was transported and sold to various places in southern She County. Last year, it suffered a severe drought, and the harvest was less than 30%. In addition, the stationed troops have recently needed a large amount of rice. Households in neighboring areas that lack grain have come to Jixi to search for it. Families that have a little surplus know that they must store it for disaster relief, but due to the needs of the end of the year, they have to sell grain to make ends meet, causing the price of rice to rise with the trend, soaring to 12 yuan per stone. Currently, the grain reserves in the city and market are very low, and prices must rise. The area around the third district has suffered bandit attacks repeatedly, and the food shortage is even more panicked. Residents of various villages have slaughtered and salted all the piglets they raised to save on food.</p>
<p>Xiuning: After last year's drought in Xiuning County, the harvest in the rice fields in the four rural townships was very good. There is very little grain stored in the city and rural areas, and the price of rice in the township market has soared to 12.56 to 13 yuan per stone. Poor households without land have long been digging ferns and picking dregs to survive. Even Wan'an, which is known as a rice-producing area, is experiencing a supply shortage, and the price of rice has risen from 11 yuan to 12.8 yuan. In order to relieve the future rice famine, the Xiuning County government has ordered each district to instruct rice merchants to register and quickly raise funds to transport rice from Hangzhou and Shanghai to maintain the food supply. A transport committee has been organized in the township to discuss transport regulations. Currently, rice merchants in various cities and rural areas are raising huge sums of money to purchase rice from ports and transport it to the township for assistance.</p>
<p>She County: After suffering a severe drought last year, the local grain reserves in She County are empty. At the beginning of the month, the price of rice soared to 14 yuan per stone. In addition, the neighboring counties have banned the export of rice, and the source is not sustainable. Merchants are using wheat flour as a substitute food, while farmers are grinding corn flour and mixing it with vegetables to make a thin soup, eating two meals a day to survive. In dozens of villages in the third district of the county, such as Xucun, Chengkan, Shangfeng, Shimen, Wangcun, and Luotian, poor people are mostly emaciated and pale, lying in the mountains and forests, digging up grass roots and bark to eat every day. Men and women in various villages in Qiankou in the fourth district go to the deep mountains every day to collect fern roots, make mountain powder to fill their stomachs, and sell them for money to make a living.

<h3 id="e87">Overview of Xuzhou's Market <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The entire port's commerce has plummeted</p>
<p>There are seven reasons for the decline</p>
<p>Xuzhou Communication: Xuzhou Port, with its convenient transportation, has always been known for its developed commerce. Datong Street, which connects the city and the station, is especially a new commercial center. Gongqia Road has many stores with strong capital and a long history. Since the accident on Datong Street the year before last and the mutual bankruptcy of grocery stores last spring, the entire port's commerce has plummeted. At this end of the lunar year, various industries are closing down. The survey is summarized as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e88">Commercial Situation Survey <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Xuzhou's industry is not prosperous, and residents who are considered well-off have all started out in business. Therefore, when faced with natural disasters or man-made calamities, the people's purchasing power disappears, and there is a shortage of resources. The silver and money industry is the mother of all industries. Since last year, various silver firms have not been lending money externally. The reason is that the money lent before last year is difficult to recover due to the bankruptcy of various industries. Therefore, silver merchants also feel the losses. This year, only the National Bank has a slight surplus. Other banks, such as the China Bank, the Communications Bank, and the Jiangsu Bank, are operating at a breakeven level. The local money industry, since the collapse of Gongyu and various ticket shops, has not been able to clear the debts to date. The auction of the ticket merchants' assets has also failed to attract buyers. Various ticket merchants are still sitting firmly in prison. The grocery industry largely collapsed last spring. Creditors from Shanghai firms jointly commissioned lawyer Zhu Shaowen to sit in Xuzhou and demand payment, repeatedly litigating and detaining, but there is no hope of clearing the debts. Only Shunji remains, while most others have closed down for liquidation. Only a few silk shops on Datong Street are barely surviving, attracting customers with price reductions, and the market is slightly active, but it is still outwardly strong but inwardly weak. Even Cai Yuanxing, which has the longest history, has closed down. The market for department stores is quite active, but it is only concentrated in Tiancheng, Huafeng, Taiyu, Taixiang, and other stores on Datong Street, and others are not worthy of mention. The sales of cotton yarn have always been the highest in rural areas. Since the bankruptcy of the countryside and the disappearance of farmers' purchasing power, this industry has felt the decline. Moreover, most of the goods are Japanese goods, and the supply route has been blocked, so the goods naturally feel scarce. Exhaustion is mostly competitive sales. Business, China, the world, Datong, and others have all suffered losses. The Western medicine industry has not been affected in any way. The combination of books and medicine compensates each other, but there is no profit to be made. These are all the main commercial industries in Xuzhou. Other industries, such as printing, brokerage, teahouses, and tourism, are only enough to make ends meet.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Reasons for Decline <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce believes that the decline in commerce this year is unprecedented. It has specifically announced the reasons for its depression: (1) The bankruptcy of the countryside is a common phenomenon in China. The United States and Europe dump their surplus food in China. China's food production cannot meet the demand, resulting in a reduction in farmers' purchasing power, which is a natural trend. (2) Xuzhou is a commercial area, not an industrial area. Since the tenth year of the Republic, although Xuzhou's commerce has been booming, it is only a selling behavior. The profit is small and the expenses are high. The past and present are very different. Without a production base, commerce has plummeted. (3) Financial depletion: The flood in the twentieth year of the Republic made people's eyes full of suffering. Finance was already insensitive. The outbreak of the Shanghai War caused the financial community to implement a tightening policy, which made the situation even more depleted. The collapse of the ticket shops made it impossible for small businesses to borrow money. The financial turnover was insensitive, and commerce fell into desperation. (4) Dumping of foreign goods: Most of the department stores in Xuzhou are Japanese goods. Since the boycott, the prices of foreign goods have fallen and dumped. Those with too many goods have not reduced half of their capital, and they are fundamentally on the verge of bankruptcy. (5) The scope of sales has shrunk: Xuzhou has always been the commercial center of northern Anhui, eastern Henan, southern Shandong, and northern Jiangsu. Since Xuzhou's economy is insensitive and there is a lack of goods, it can no longer supply the goods. The scope has shrunk, and the business is even more declining. (6) The industry rules are not complete, and the losses from pawned goods are too great: After the flood and the Shanghai War, Xuzhou merchants did not know to reduce the scope of their business and continued to borrow money to buy goods. When they could not sell the goods and were under financial pressure, they mortgaged them to the bank. At the time when the price of goods was falling, the amount of the mortgage was already small, and interest was added. Therefore, those who pawned goods lost almost all of their capital. (7) Huge expenses: The standard of living in Xuzhou has gradually increased, but the level of production has not increased. The two are weighed against each other, and the income does not cover the expenses, so they are gradually moving towards bankruptcy. The above are all the main reasons for the decline in commerce in Xuzhou.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Relief Strategies <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>After the Chamber of Commerce announced the reasons for the depression, it formulated the following relief strategies: Xuzhou's commerce is so depressed, and commerce is the backbone of Xuzhou's social organization. The situation is declining day by day, which is worrying. The Chamber of Commerce specifically announced the relief strategies to all industries: (1) For stores that are not currently bankrupt, the situation is relatively reliable. Banks should try to plan loans to facilitate turnover. (2) The banking industry's tightening is due to the loss of social credit. In the future, all stores should try to restore their reputation to strengthen the bank's credit. (3) Reduce expenses to maintain the status quo. (4) The real prosperity of Xuzhou's commerce should pay attention to the development of industry to consolidate the foundation of business. (5) Xuzhou is originally an industrial area. Foreigners are not aware of the situation in Xuzhou and have not dared to invest. The government should pay attention to the use of foreign capital and provide it with considerable guarantees. (6) The prosperity of commerce lies in the revitalization of the countryside, and the revitalization of the countryside should pay attention to production and construction. The government should especially promote and assist it. Some of the above strategies may be beyond the power of the commercial forces, so they require the expression of political forces, so that production and construction can be used as the basis for revitalization and prosperity.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Northeastern Anti-Japanese Volunteers Fighting Hard in the Severe Winter <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Zhaoshangzhi's Troops in Yanji</p>
<p>Kong Xianrong's Troops in Dongning</p>
<p>Volunteers in Fuyu Also Active</p>
<p>Harbin Communication: Three years have passed since the Japanese army occupied our Northeast. The anti-Japanese volunteers in various places have fallen one after another, but the spirit of killing the enemy has not diminished. The recent situation of the volunteers fighting bravely and the activities of the Japanese and puppet troops is recorded as follows: The most active volunteers in the area along the puppet "Jingtu Line" are Zhaoshangzhi's troops. The area near Yanji has long been occupied by the volunteers. Although the Japanese and puppet police have repeatedly attacked, the volunteers have not only not suffered losses, but have been able to obtain guns and ammunition every time they fight. The Japanese and puppet troops have been repeatedly severely damaged, and they falsely accuse our volunteers of being the Red Army. It is reported that Zhaobu has only a few hundred people, but the morale is very high. The Dongning and Ning'an counties in the Suining area of the puppet Fourth Military Region have long been occupied by the volunteers' leaders Kong Xianrong, Chai Shirong, Zhong Jiusheng, Zhang Yuting, Li Sanlai, and others. There are about 10,000 volunteers in that area, and they are currently concentrating on training. Last fall, they fought with the Japanese and puppet troops several times. The Japanese army was defeated, and hundreds of puppet troops were disarmed. Therefore, the Japanese army also falsely accuses the volunteers in that area of having a considerable background. The area of Huaxin Dingzi in the Eighth District of Liaoning's Changfeng County has been recovered by the volunteers. In addition, Hailong, Qingyuan, and other county volunteers' leader Hailin led more than 400 people to Dongfeng, where the puppet troops stationed in the county went to attack. The two sides fought fiercely. The police and armor of Hu Xiantang in Hengdaohezi all assisted the puppet troops. However, the volunteers concentrated their elite troops and broke through the encirclement in the middle of the night. As a result, both sides suffered casualties. In addition, in Huanren County, there are Commander Mi, Zhan Dongbian, and Dongbian Army, who are cooperating with the Korean People's Revolutionary Army to resist Japan. The army is very strong. In addition, there are also more than 100 volunteers in Faku County, who are fighting hard against the puppet police. The leader is unknown. In the third district of Jilin's Fuyu County, more than 200 volunteers from Binjianghao, Danye, Laolaihao, Shengping, and other troops suddenly came and advanced into the seventh district. The puppet authorities have divided the military and police to defend. However, the volunteers attacked the puppet Fourth Police Station in Jiangjia Wobao in the seventh district at 6:00 AM on the 13th, and all the guns and ammunition of the more than 80 puppet police and self-defense corps were confiscated. The strength of the volunteers has greatly increased. The volunteers are planning to unite with the Dadongyang Department, which has more than 100 people, complete with guns and horses, and the number of people has increased sharply. They are planning to change their strategy to take Fuyu County to plan a major move. The Japanese puppets are setting up defenses.</p>

The opening price for the British-American exchange rate was $4.883125, which is 0.0625 higher than yesterday's closing price for the US-British exchange rate. It rose another 375 at noon, and another 375 at 2:00 PM, to $4.890625. Also, one US dollar is equal to 4 shillings and 1.073 pence in British gold. British and French: The opening price was 74 francs and 40 centimes, which is 3 pounds higher than yesterday's closing price. At 2:00 PM, it rose 13 pounds to 74 francs and 53 centimes, a total increase of 10 pounds compared to yesterday's closing price. American and British: The opening price for the American-British exchange rate was $4.89, which is 75 higher than yesterday's closing price, showing the upward trend of the pound sterling. American and French: The American-French exchange rate, on the other hand, showed an improvement in the US dollar, with an opening price of $6.56125, which is 125 lower.</p>

<p>American Cotton: Cotton market transactions were also very small, with an opening price about 2 pounds lower than yesterday's closing price. British Cotton: The price in the Liverpool cotton market at 1:00 PM today was 6.72, which is the same as yesterday's price. British Wheat: The price of the May futures in the Liverpool wheat market at 1:00 PM today was 4 shillings and 11 pence, the same as yesterday's price. American Wheat: The Chicago wheat market had a slight rebound, but in terms of the ground, the market situation has improved. The slight drop in prices today is probably due to the good weather in the southwestern wheat region. The trend of miscellaneous grains is the same as that of wheat.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Rubber <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>London: The London rubber market was quiet, with prices loosening in the morning.

The price for the March period was 12.66, which is a sharp drop of ten Zhejiang pounds compared to yesterday's closing price.</p>

<p>New York: The reason for the unease in various U.S. markets is solely when the Supreme Court's verdict on the gold clause case can be expected to be announced. Not only the stock exchange but also the commodity markets were affected at the opening today, resulting in generally sluggish trading without any highlights. Operators are temporarily unwilling to buy or sell. Although various markets have procedures to protect their interests, market sentiment still feels uncertain. The stock exchange authorities are now preparing to take necessary actions after the court's verdict is announced to prevent or limit price volatility. Commodity markets are also considering similar actions. These protection plans have indeed reassured speculators and restored some confidence, but the wait-and-see trend remains. The stock market opened sluggishly, and it is expected that today's market conditions will remain mixed throughout, with a lack of interest, slow trading, and minimal price fluctuations without any notable changes. The various prices are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e99">Active Construction in Eastern Siberia <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>(Vladivostok Correspondence)</p>
<p>Mineral Development, Implementation of Electrification</p>
<p>In the past few centuries, especially during the Tsarist autocracy and the initial stages of the revolutionary movement, the mention of Siberia generally sent shivers down the spines of Russians, who considered it a living hell on earth. This was because Siberia had a harsh climate and a sparse population. Although the Imperial Russian government made great efforts to encourage the settlement of civilians after the completion of the Trans-Siberian Railway, the number of people who migrated there was still very small, while the number of people sentenced to exile was very large. Therefore, the general public's fear of Siberia is still quite prevalent today. The Soviet government paid special attention to Siberia during the first Five-Year Plan period, and since the beginning of the second Five-Year Plan, it has been determined to implement development. Therefore, in terms of taxation, tax rates were specially reduced, and in terms of supply, extra preferential treatment was given.</p>
<p>In terms of national defense, Commander of the Far Eastern Red Army Blyukher publicly stated during last year's revolutionary anniversary, "...I can assert that the Far Eastern Red Army can safeguard the peace of the motherland's borders and can firmly secure the distant borders..." Such words, on the surface, are very mild, but they strongly imply the solidity of its defense. In terms of the navy, Viktorov, Commander of the Far Eastern Navy and Chairman of the Far Eastern Naval Military Revolutionary Council, is directing the reconstruction of the Vladivostok naval port and the replenishment of submarines, preparing to cope calmly in case of emergencies. In terms of politics and economy, Larentsov is providing guidance in the name of the secretary of the Communist Party's Far Eastern Regional Committee. There is also Kirdov, Chairman of the Far Eastern Regional Executive Committee, who decides the highest guiding principles. These four people, except for Blyukher (i.e., General Galen) who is relatively well-known, are all emerging talents. It is feared that very few people abroad know about them. The Far Eastern region has a total area of approximately 2,332,000 square kilometers (five times the size of present-day Germany), while the population is only slightly more than 1.6 million. The Soviet government, recognizing the importance of the Far Eastern region, and after the September 18th Incident, even more clearly understood the dangerous situation in the Far East. Therefore, in addition to vigorously strengthening war preparations to prevent any emergencies, it further investigated the special circumstances, natural resources, and ethnic conditions of various regions, and designated the coastal province as an industrial zone within the Far Eastern region, aiming to develop its coal, iron, gold, zinc, silver, and other mineral deposits, as well as fisheries and forests.</p>
<p>The coastal province will use the "Bureya" coalfield as the center of its mining industry. According to experts' surveys, the coalfield has reserves of approximately 100 billion tons, making it the second-largest coalfield in the Soviet Union. After full development, not only will the ships along the Amur River use its coal, but the cities planned to be built in Khabarovsk, Komsomolsk-on-Amur, Birobidzhan, etc., will also be supplied with fuel from this coal mine. The coastal province was originally a place without a power industry, which hindered the development of general industries. Now, there are plans to build a large power plant with a generating capacity of 100,000 kilowatts (KiloWatt). The construction cost is estimated at 100 million rubles. Currently, 2,500 workers are engaged in the work, and the completion period is one year and two months.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Recently Captured Communist Bandit Leaders by the National Army <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>

<p>(Left) Liu Chouxi, Pseudo-Commander of the Tenth Army (Right) Wang Ruchih, Pseudo-Commander of the Tenth Army and Concurrent Commander of the Nineteenth Division</p>
<p>In terms of transportation, the Ussuri Railway did not feel the "passing trains" problem very seriously in the past because the transportation demand was not very large. However, recently, due to delays caused by "passing trains" in military and industrial development, it has been deemed very uneconomical. That's why a double track is being laid, and it will be fully completed this year. However, they are still considering the future. If an emergency occurs between the Soviet Union and Japan, the Ussuri Railway and the Trans-Siberian Railway will inevitably be cut off. Therefore, it has been decided to build the BAM Railway, connecting the northern part of Lake Baikal, the lower reaches of the Amur River, and Nikolayevsk-on-Amur. At the same time, air traffic connects Europe to Nikolayevsk-on-Amur, Sakhalin Island, and the "Chekotka" of the Arctic Ocean.</p>
<p>In terms of culture and education, the Far Eastern region was extremely closed in the past, but now it is gradually developing. They not only have elementary textbooks but also books like dictionaries. For example, in the coastal province, there are 135 school children for every 1,000 people, and 85% of adults are literate. There are a total of 30 specialized schools, universities, workers' preparatory courses, technical schools, factory apprentice schools, etc., with more than 8,100 students. Because of the development of natural products, the increase in population, and the improvement of cultural standards, general consumption has also increased simultaneously. In 1933, it increased by 230% compared to 1931, and from January to October 1934, it increased to 430% of 1931. However, consumer goods are still insufficient. The general social consumption power and productivity are still increasing. (January 19)</p>
<h3 id="e101">Gradual Improvement in Freight Transportation on the Wuhu-Xuancheng Section of the Jingwu Railway <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Completion of the Dangtu River Bridge Project, Local Products Along the Route Transported to Wuhu for Export</p>
<p>Tunxi Correspondence: Since the construction of the Jingwu Railway by the Jiangnan Railway Company began, the progress of the project has been very rapid. Although the rainy weather for more than 20 days in early January has hindered progress to some extent, work has continued as usual without interruption. Currently, the track-laying project has reached the bank of the Dangtu River. Material vehicles travel back and forth several times a day, and passenger cars are attached to carry passengers. Three stations have been set up from Wuhu to Dangtu, and ticket sales began in the early part of the month. However, due to the transportation of materials, there is no accurate departure time, and there are few passengers. The Dangtu River Bridge project is currently 80% complete. It is being rushed day and night, and it is expected to be completed by mid-October. After the bridge is completed, not only will trains be able to pass through, but also the automobiles traveling on the Jingwu Highway will pass through, which will save the difficulty of crossing the river. As for the Wuhu-Xuancheng section, it has been open to traffic for half a year, and the business is mediocre. In addition, last year, various counties in southern Anhui suffered from drought and banditry, and the vitality of the rural areas was greatly damaged, which greatly affected the railway's business. At the beginning of the opening of freight transportation, the business was extremely light. In addition to expanding publicity in various ports along the line to promote its responsible transportation efficiency, the company also provided merchants with various conveniences. In the past two months, freight transportation has gradually improved. Xuancheng, Shuidong, Wangzhi, and other places' Xuancheng paper, tribute dates, rice, and other products are transported by train to Wuhu and then reloaded for export. Local products from Tunxi and Huining are mostly transported to Xuancheng via the Wuhu-Tunxi Road and then loaded onto trains to Wuhu. Recently, the coal from Huishan near Sunjiabu has also been transported by train. Therefore, the railway's freight transportation has been more developed than before. The freight revenue for the past two months has also gradually increased. (February 1)</p>

<p>Bandits Shot Dead on the Spot</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: The Anhui Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau reported on the morning of the 1st that gunshots were heard outside the South Gate, according to a report from the Nan River Patrol Police Station. The station chief immediately ordered Inspector Zhang Rujia and Detective Team Leader Xie Lizhong to lead team members and police officers to rush to the scene, and also telegraphed Qian Ruiting, the director of the Second Branch Bureau, to lead the police to take action. It was immediately discovered that bandits were robbing Yuan Yinji's plaster shop at No. 9 Xicheng Street outside the South Gate. When asked about the shopkeeper's son, he claimed that the bandit was about thirty years old, spoke with a Hanshan County accent, and had two gold teeth. After entering the shop, he turned around and closed the door, holding a pistol in his hand, and forbade anyone to make a sound. He claimed that he was short of travel expenses and had come to borrow 100 yuan. He immediately ordered the money counter to be opened, and took away all the bank notes inside: one 5-yuan note from the Bank of China, two 5-yuan notes from the Central Bank, 7 or 8 yuan in silver dollars, three 1-yuan notes, and about 1 yuan in small denomination notes. He fired a shot when he left, and the bullet hit the counter. After the bandit left the shop, he fired three more shots as a warning and fled towards Xicheng Lane. At that time, the residents along the street were extremely frightened, and the shopkeeper's son followed behind the bandit, shouting "Catch the thief!" The police officers on duty followed and chased after him. It happened that police officer Huang Yezeng of the Second Branch Bureau encountered the bandit in Xicheng Lane and intercepted him. The bandit fired several shots in a row, and the bandit also returned fire. The bandit was shot dead on the spot. A divorce document was found on the bandit's body, with the name Cao Xulai, a native of Hanshan County, residing in Wuhu. There was also an eight-shot pistol, four bullets, and more than 20 yuan in banknotes and silver dollars robbed from Yuan Yinji's shop. (February 2)</p>

<p>Since Zhejiang suffered a drought disaster last year, about 2,000 refugees have been stranded in Songjiang. The Songjiang Red Cross Society, witnessing this miserable situation, gathered local comrades and established a shelter at Chao Gu Temple. It has been accommodating refugees for days, with already 1,300 to 1,400 people. The management is gradually taking shape. The county government's official letters to the relief institute are listed below: (1) Letter from the Songjiang County Relief Institute: Responding directly: "Upon receiving your society's Letter No. 7, which states, 'To whom it may concern, recently, disaster victims from Zhejiang Province have been arriving in Songjiang in an endless stream, all without clothing or food. Our society, witnessing this miserable situation, cannot bear to sit idly by. Therefore, we plan to establish a temporary shelter for Zhejiang drought disaster refugees. We have decided to start accommodating them at Songjiang Chao Guo Temple on the 31st of this month. Your institute aims to provide relief and shares the same charitable goal as our society. We dare to write to request your assistance at any time and also request a copy of the situation of the disaster victims in Songjiang and the register of disaster victims, so that we can learn from it. We are extremely grateful,' etc. Approved. Upon investigation, refugees from western Zhejiang are fleeing famine to Songjiang one after another.

<p>Yang Xingqin's family, a farmer in Dongyu Village, Zhangjiawan Township, Qitu, Tianma Mountain, was broken into by eight or nine bandits at 12:00 on the night of the 31st of last month. They robbed three and a half stones of white rice, 3,000 copper coins, New Year's cakes, fresh meat, and other items. Before leaving, they hit Yang Xingqin's biological father, Jiang Defu, with an iron bamboo shoot shovel, piercing his skull, and he died instantly. The next day, the Tianma Mountain Branch Station was informed, which reported it to the County Public Security Bureau, which sent detectives to investigate. Fei Gongxia, the captain of the Water Patrol Team, also went to investigate and questioned the victim in detail about the process. Yang's relative, Lai Pi A Bu, had a recent quarrel with Jiang Defu, and it was believed that A Bu was highly suspected. A Bu was arrested in Songjiang and sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. However, according to A Bu's statement, on the night of the incident, he stayed at a certain family's house in Songcheng. Further investigation is pending.</p>

<p>The Gu family, a farmer in Hushu Pass, Suzhou, about three miles from the town, had considerable assets, so they were coveted by bandits. On the night of the last day of the lunar year, many bandits suddenly came with weapons to rob.

<p>Discovery of the Coffin of Di Qing of the Song Dynasty</p>
<p>Townspeople in Huangtutang Town, District 7 of this county, automatically dredged the river in the town for the sake of planning for this spring before the rains, due to the severe drought last summer. Unexpectedly, when plowing the mud at the bottom of the river, they suddenly could not plow down, and there was a clanging sound on the ground. They loosened the surrounding mud and dug at the place where the sound came from, and found a huge red coffin, more than fifteen feet long, five feet wide, and as high as a person's shoulders. One end of the coffin was engraved with the twelve characters "The Coffin of General Di Qing, Grand Chancellor of the Song Dynasty", and the coffin wood from time to time emits a strange fragrance, presumed to be made of Agarwood. The townspeople were shocked and happy. They uncovered the lid to examine it, but unexpectedly, there were no clothes, quilts, or corpses inside, only two jade cups, crystal clear and lovely. According to Di Qing, he was from Xihe in the Northern Song Dynasty, known as Han Chen. He was proficient in military strategy and repeatedly made military exploits during the reign of Emperor Renzong, and was appointed as the Privy Councilor and Grand Chancellor. After his death, he was given the posthumous title of Wu Xiang and was once granted jade mandarin ducks. The above-mentioned jade cups may be the jade mandarin ducks that have been passed down from generation to generation, but the words of unofficial historians should not be taken as complete evidence.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of winter in this county, the weather has been warm, and the Fahrenheit thermometer has been above 50 degrees, and there has been no snowfall. The farmers are quite worried. The day before yesterday was the Beginning of Spring Festival, and the temperature was even higher. Walking in a fur coat felt sweaty and breathless. At the same time, the sky was blue, and the breeze was gentle and the sun was bright. Chong'an Temple and other places were filled with an endless stream of tourists. The business of various entertainment venues was also quite good. Yesterday, after dawn, the weather turned cold, and the thermometer dropped to 44 degrees. From 8:00 AM, snow suddenly began to fall, and after 9:00 AM, it became slightly larger, mixed with drizzle. The sky was covered with dark clouds, indicating a heavy snowfall.</p>

<p>Overview of the Closure of Various Industries at the End of the Lunar Year</p>
<p>After last year's drought disaster in Wujin County, the rural economy was on the verge of bankruptcy, purchasing power was weak, and business was declining, presenting an unprecedented situation. It was already difficult to barely maintain and pass through peacefully. During this period, closures due to poor turnover and losses were frequently heard. The best performance among industries was beans and cotton, which were able to make a profit under such a bleak situation. The bean industry had already made a considerable profit in 1933. In 1934, the goods arriving by land and water were extremely crowded, all concentrated in the Dou Shihe area, and the trading was very extensive. Regardless of the size of the firms, all had a surplus. As for local cotton, which is produced in Wujin County, factories have been established in recent years to improve production, and the factory cloth produced has been increasing year by year, and the distant ones are sold to the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong. Last year, the industry worked hard and the business was booming, so it was able to make a profit at the end of the year. Other industries, such as wood, oil mills, and rice, had a slight profit. The silk and foreign goods industries suffered from low prices and high expenses, and some suffered losses and closures. The clothing industry found it difficult to maintain due to cheap silk cloth and outdated inventory. As for the money shops, they have all closed down since the January 28th Incident. Last year, only HSBC, Hongxiang, and Taicheng remained, and there was no surplus profit to be made. It is feared that it will be difficult to maintain this year. With the decline of money shops, banks have risen. In addition to the branches established by foreign banks, Wujin Bank, which is in this county, has been open for only a little over a year and already has a profit to speak of.</p>

<p>Registration of Household Registration in Lawsuits</p>
<p>The Provincial Government recently announced to the counties of Jiangbei that most of the Baojia system has been completed, and the counties of Jiangnan are also in the process of implementation. It specially instructed all counties and requested the Higher Court to forward the instructions for compliance. From now on, when the people file lawsuits with the government and autonomous organs, or enter into contracts with each other, they must register their household registration in the nationality column in accordance with the current Baojia organization (for example, the number of districts, townships, Bao, Jia, and households in a certain county) in order to train the general public to recognize the importance of the Baojia and further understand the close relationship between the government and each other.</p>

<p>Security Branch Executes Five Pirates by Firing Squad</p>
<p>Five pirates, Hua Zhongxian, Chen Meixian, Chen A Luo, Yang Simei, and Chen Meijie, and the bandit leader San Laoda and others, gathered in the Donglang Sea Mountain area of the former Taiwan jurisdiction, resisted government troops, robbed passing merchant ships, and kidnapped as many as thirty-eight or nine passengers. They hid in the Donglang Mountain cave. In July of this year, the Yongping warship of the Water Police Team, together with the Linhai Cadre Team, went to encircle and suppress them. The bandits resisted stubbornly, injuring six police officers and water police. Subsequently, the Water Police and others launched a fierce attack, killing seven bandits at the time, capturing Hua Zhongxian and others alive, and rescuing thirty-eight refugees. After the bandits were captured, they were sent to the Second Security Branch and sentenced to death according to law. Yesterday (the 31st), upon receiving the order from Chairman Chiang, the branch immediately extracted the bandits Hua Zhongxian and others and tied them to Fengcao Horse Road in Jiangbei for execution by firing squad.</p>

<p>The Scene at the Start of the Abandoned Lunar Year</p>
<p>Here, various businesses, except for teahouses and the like, followed the usual practice of closing for three days at the start of the abandoned lunar year. The three banks in the North City—China, Local, and Farmers—also closed for three days. Theaters opened everywhere, and due to the clear weather and low prices, most were fully booked. As for the overall financial outcome of businesses in the Jiaxu year, according to investigations, accounts received only amounted to sixty to seventy percent. Moreover, with the exception of rice businesses, which had some profit, all other industries suffered losses. Many businesses were uncertain whether they could continue operating due to insufficient capital turnover. Furthermore, the Dingtai clearinghouse on Middle Street declared liquidation the day before yesterday, with debts reaching over ten thousand yuan. However, its remaining inventory was only worth two to three thousand yuan, making the liquidation quite difficult.</p>

<p>Zou Boyang, a revenue officer from the Third District Revenue Bureau, suddenly disappeared on February 2nd, just as the bureau was about to settle tax payments. The bureau sent people to search for him, but his whereabouts remained unknown. They inquired at his home, but his family also did not know where he had gone. An inspection of the tax tickets he carried revealed that over 1,700 yuan had been taken. According to his colleagues, Zou had been continuously misappropriating collected taxes, amounting to over 400 yuan, which he could not make up, leading to his departure. It is now known that the bureau has received a letter from him from Pukou, requesting that they not pursue the matter, promising to repay the money later, and asking that they not pursue his guarantor. The bureau has now sent someone, along with his guarantor Zou Yixiang, to Pukou yesterday to search for him.</p>

<p>Post Office Remittance Department Director Flees with Large Sum of Money</p>
<p>Wang Pingkun, from Huaining, aged over thirty, the director of the remittance department of the Hefei Post Office, had incurred significant debts while serving as the postmaster of the Sanhe Post Office due to excessive indulgence. After being transferred to the Hefei Post Office, he embezzled public funds. When the new postmaster Qi Rongqing took office and began working diligently, Wang feared exposure and punishment. Taking advantage of the Lunar New Year season, when businesses in the city were remitting large sums of money to various ports along the Yangtze River for settlement, on January 29th, he suddenly fled with over 21,000 silver dollars. His mother, wife, and five children also left the area at the same time. Postmaster Qi Rongqing was shocked upon discovering this and immediately telegraphed the Postal Administration Bureau, which forwarded the report to the Ministry of Transportation, notifying the governments of all provinces and ordering all cities and counties to conduct thorough searches of arriving passengers to prevent anyone from escaping. At the same time, he notified the local military and government authorities to conduct a strict search. The county government has ordered the First District Office to conduct a census of the entire city. So far, he has not been found. It is reported that Wang had received a letter from a friend at a post office outside the customs pass a few days earlier, urging him to go there. Wang may have fled outside the customs pass this time.</p>

<p>He is 65 Years Old</p>
<p>Married Just Last Year</p>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, Dr. Voronoff, a renowned surgeon who invented the rejuvenation technique of grafting ape gonads into humans, has arrived in Shanghai and is staying at the Cathay Hotel. The doctor is 65 years old and full of energy. Born in Russia, he moved to Paris at the age of 17. He speaks fluent English when talking to people. The doctor said, "I have been engaged in experiments for many years. I believe that it is a mistake for doctors to only treat diseases. Old age and physical weakness should be strengthened, and the inability of men and women of middle age to resist diseases is not a good sign. Look at the newspapers, famous people aged 65 to 70 often die in winter. This is because they are unable to resist the cold. Once their physical strength declines, any accident can kill them, which is inevitable. Therefore, they die. My entire work is to restore people's normal life expectancy. If we can repair the human body like repairing a car, replacing old parts with new ones, then we can achieve this goal. You cannot replace the brain or heart with new ones, but you can replace the mechanism that operates these organs. Glands without transporting tubes are the mechanism that controls the so-called essential organs. We can replace these glands with new ones because the problem lies with the glands themselves, not the heart of the glands. Only the heart may be diseased, but if healthy, it can last forever." The doctor continued, saying that after many years of experimentation, he performed the first experiment on humans in 1920, grafting the gonads of healthy apes into humans. The result was to increase human lifespan, eliminate some deep wrinkles, strengthen the necessary resistance to disease, and make people energetic. After five or six years, a 70-year-old man who has undergone the procedure looks like he is about 50 years old and feels that way himself. However, after six years, the procedure must be performed again. Therefore, the number of times the procedure is performed to maintain health cannot be limited. After continuing to research, he discovered that in addition to the gonads, there are other things that maintain youthfulness. The adrenal glands and thyroid gland also play a major role in human decline. Five years ago, he discovered the classification of ape blood, which is the same as human blood. However, ape blood only contains the third and fourth types. Therefore, men and women belonging to the first or second blood types cannot benefit from the procedure. When asked by reporters about the success rate of the procedure, the doctor replied that only five or six out of a hundred people who adhere to all the rules of the procedure and are thorough without any omissions can obtain absolute and satisfactory results. Healthy life can be extended for 10 to 12 years. The doctor also explained that removing the thyroid gland will result in idiocy, and removing the adrenal glands will immediately stop the heart. Therefore, grafting these three glands can restore the strength of the human body through the action of the heart and brain. Reporters then asked why the effect of the surgery does not last long. The doctor replied that humans can only imitate the Creator. God created a complete vascular tissue to nourish the organs and glands of the human body, reaching every pore. We cannot imitate this so completely. Therefore, when the blood vessels we graft into the human body have completed their work, the glands with insufficient nutrition will lose their function and must be operated on again. Reporters asked the doctor to try his skills while staying in Shanghai. The doctor and his wife both smiled. The doctor concluded, "We were married eight months ago and are currently on our honeymoon tour. After leaving Shanghai, we will also travel to Japan and the United States."</p>

<p>Shanghai-Minhang Long-Distance Phone Service Opened</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, in order to facilitate communication for residents of Minhang and to improve transportation to Shanghai and other places, requested permission from the Ministry of Transportation to establish a Minhang branch. After the required pole and line materials were delivered in November of last year, the bureau sent workers to install them. After three months, at great expense, it is heard that the initial main line project, as well as the public telephones at the Minhang Telephone Branch, the Beiqiao County Government, and the Zhuanqiao Public Education Center, were completed a few days ago. Director Xu Xueyu, Chief Engineer Yu Bingjian, and others from Shanghai and Minhang connected and tested the phones from the long-distance station in the Zhabei Telephone Branch. The sound waves were quite clear. It is heard that the bureau is scheduled to open the phone service first on the 6th and that the Ministry of Transportation has stipulated the following rates for public telephones between Minhang and Beiqiao, between Minhang and Zhuanqiao, and between Beiqiao and Zhuanqiao: five cents per call, as well as the rates for calls between Shanghai and Minhang, and between Minhang and other places. The rate table for calls between Minhang, Beiqiao, Zhuanqiao, and other places is copied below: Shanghai Wusong 25 cents, Pudong Zhenru 25 cents, Shanghai Concession Nanxiang Baoshan 30 cents, Kunshan 45 cents, Suzhou 60 cents, Taicang 65 cents, Changshu 75 cents, Wuxi 85 cents, Jiangyin 1.10 yuan, Jingjiang 1.15 yuan, Taixing 1.30 yuan, Nantong 1.50 yuan, Tangjiazha 1.55 yuan, Tianshenggang 1.55 yuan, Changzhou 1.10 yuan, Danyang 1.35 yuan, Zhenjiang 1.40 yuan, Yangzhou 1.60 yuan, Longtan 1.55 yuan, Nanjing 1.65 yuan, Xinzhen 50 cents, Songjiang 45 cents, Sijing 50 cents, Qibao 55 cents, Qingpu Zhujiajiao 55 cents, Guanxing 1.35 yuan, Liuhe 75 cents, Wujiang 85 cents, Pingwang 95 cents, Hupu 95 cents, Fushan 85 cents, Liyang 1.55 yuan. According to Chief Engineer Yu of the Bureau, the Minhang branch is currently installing telephones for town residents and will register them in order of priority. In addition to collecting the installation deposit fee according to the general bureau's regulations, the monthly rental fee for users within the Minhang area is 4 yuan for shops and 3 yuan for residences. Long-distance call fees to Shanghai and other places will be calculated separately according to the above rate table.</p>

<p>Reuters, Shanghai, 6th: Last week, it was widely reported in the city that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Affairs Commission convened an important meeting in Beijing to draft a plan to immediately reform China's currency and financial system. Reuters issued a news report on January 31st stating that the authorities denied such news. According to the highest authority, not only was no such meeting held, but the claim that a Currency Advisory Committee had been established as a result of this meeting was also incorrect. In fact, this action was decided by the Minister of Finance several months ago and was not the result of the Finance Minister's recent visit to Beijing. A Reuters reporter interviewed Finance Minister Kong in Shanghai, who said that he decided to appoint a Currency Advisory Committee several months ago to establish a regular body so that the Finance Minister could at any time seek the opinions of leading bankers in the country. The committee has only recently been formed and has not yet put forward concrete recommendations on the specific actions to be taken to deal with the current financial situation, nor has it developed a plan to reform the currency system. Outside reports about the relationship of the appointment of this Advisory Committee are clearly exaggerated. Even if the committee makes suggestions on currency reform in the future, it is impossible to predict what decisions the central government will make at this time. Any decision on this matter will depend on the situation.</p>

Those who instigate the smuggling will be severely punished. (2) After the confiscated silver coins or silver-related exports are sold, bonuses will be awarded according to the following methods: A. If the seizure is made solely by customs or military and police agencies, the bonus will be doubled according to the customs' reward method for those without informants, that is, 60% will be awarded for extraordinary merit and 40% for ordinary merit. For example, if 10,000 silver coins are smuggled and seized, military police or customs officers with extraordinary merit will be awarded 6,000 yuan, and those with ordinary merit will be awarded 4,000 yuan. B. If customs receive information from an informant and the seizure is made with the assistance of military and police agencies, the bonus will be doubled according to the customs' reward method for those with informants. Military police and informants will each receive 40%, and customs officers will receive 20%.

These provisions must be followed and will be implemented from January 15th of this year. However, the reward and punishment measures do not apply to smuggled silver subsidiary coins in domestic ports seized by customs or military and police agencies. The bonus for military and police agencies should be regarded as a collective and distributed accordingly, not issued to the military and police agencies separately in the prescribed amounts. This is hereby proclaimed.</p>

<p>The Hai'ning County Public Security Bureau sent this newspaper an urgent letter on the 3rd, stating that the case of Shanghai Shenbao General Manager Mr. Shi Liangcai and Deng Zixun being ambushed and killed by bandits at Shangkou, on the western border of Hai'ning County, has been under repeated orders from the Zhejiang Provincial authorities to be solved by Xu Yan, the Chief of the Hai'ning County Public Security Bureau. Chief Xu has traveled to Shanghai three times to purchase leads and supervise the investigation. He has reported the clues obtained to superiors at all levels. It is now known that Chief Xu personally investigated and confirmed that Yu Gang, also known as Yu Xiaoren, who opened the Yunquanxuan opium den and ran the Youmin business in Shenzhuang, Pudong, is highly suspected of being involved in the Shi case and has connections with the bandit Liu Guitang and a certain Communist. It is also reported that Yu Gang and others received large sums of money from the Shi case and spent them. Chief Xu continued to secretly investigate. Chief Xu returned to Ning on January 30th due to urgent bureau affairs, but left a detective and several informants in Shanghai to ensure that the suspect was apprehended and brought to justice. At 11:00 AM on the 2nd of this month, Yu Gang and Song Miaosheng, who was dining with him, were apprehended at the Shenzhuang opium den. A Browning pistol with serial number 241529 and more than a dozen bullets were seized on the spot. Yu Gang was escorted back to Hai'ning overnight. However, the guns, ammunition, and Song Miaosheng were taken away by the Nanhui County police team. After Yu Gang is interrogated, a document will be sent to Nanhui to request their transfer.</p>

<p>After the end of January, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, due to the continuous collapse of four native banks, on February 2nd, once again released funds with collateral to facilitate financial circulation. It is reported that on the 2nd and 3rd, a total of 5 million yuan was released, of which 1.96 million yuan was collateralized with deed documents. Because deed documents must be processed by the authorities before they become effective, the Native Bankers' Association acted as guarantor. The rest was collateralized by warehouse receipts for goods, etc. This helped to overcome the difficulty of the final accounting and stabilized the market.</p>

<p>Strict Suppression of Unregistered Institutions</p>
<p>Prior Filing Required for Branch Establishment</p>
<p>Ta Kung Pao reports that although most banks and financial institutions established by merchants and people in various provinces and cities have applied for registration according to regulations to be supervised and directed by the government, some are still hesitant and may violate government orders. To emphasize supervision, the Ministry of Finance has compiled a detailed list of banks, native banks, financial companies, and trust companies that have been approved for registration, and has sent notices to the provincial and municipal governments to instruct their respective competent authorities to conduct thorough investigations. Any unregistered banks, native banks, financial companies, or trust companies should be ordered to register with the Ministry of Finance immediately, while supervision should continue at all times. As for banks and companies that have already been approved for registration, if they establish branches in various provinces and cities, they should submit films of documents approved by the Ministry to the local government for review and filing. Those who establish branches without approval from the Ministry should be reported to the Ministry by the local government for investigation and handling to be suppressed. This collaborative effort aims to ensure comprehensive supervision of financial operations, to provide reliable protection for the people's economy. The municipal government of this city has already received the Ministry of Finance's notice and has instructed the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to pay attention to investigation and reporting at all times.</p>

<h3 id="e148">Railway Bureau Builds Office Buildings for the North Station <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Decision Made at the Baoshan Road Intersection</p>
<p>Borrowing from the Pension Savings Fund</p>
<p>The headquarters of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration was originally at the Shanghai North Station. After being destroyed in the January 28th Incident in 1932, it temporarily rented office space, incurring huge annual rental costs. Furthermore, some departments were scattered in other locations, making communication inconvenient. In the autumn of the previous year, there was a proposal to rebuild the headquarters. The Ministry of Railways sent personnel to survey the site, with the principle of utilizing the existing railway land to save land purchase costs. Three locations were surveyed: one near the Maigen Road freight station, one at the Baoshan Road intersection, and one near the Shanghai West Station (i.e., Fanwangdu Station). The Baoshan Road location was the most suitable for management due to its connection with the current North Station. The Shanghai West Station location had the best environment and convenient transportation. The Maigen Road location was inferior in terms of both environment and transportation. After discussion, it was decided to use the Baoshan Road intersection as the new headquarters site. In terms of funding, it was negotiated that the Pension Savings Fund Committee of the two railways would allocate 700,000 yuan, which would be repaid annually with principal and interest using the current rental costs of the Riverside Mansion. At the same time, the bureau negotiated with the China-British Bank for agreement. Dong Dayou, an architect, was hired to be responsible for the architectural design and supervision of the project. A contract has been signed, and Deputy Director Pu and Director Ying have been designated as representatives for coordination, with specific responsibilities. However, the land at the Baoshan Road intersection was originally leased to the Shengshun Company to build the Shengshun Lane houses for rent. According to the lease agreement, negotiations were held with the company to recover a portion of the leased land, with an area of ​​approximately three mu. Recently, both parties reached an agreement. Due to the construction of the bureau's office, the old houses that need to be demolished include six three-story buildings, numbered 9, 39, 47, 53, 59, and 65, and seven two-story buildings, numbered 10, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24. All of them will be purchased by the railway bureau at an estimated price according to the contract and returned by the end of March. A portion of the purchase price has already been paid, and the Shengshun Company has notified all tenants to vacate before the end of March. Therefore, the railway bureau expects construction of the new headquarters to begin in April of this year.</p>

<p>Comes to China to Inspect the Actual Situation</p>
<p>According to yesterday's "Nisshin Mainichi Shimbun," a 13-member China Observation Group from the Kiryu City Textile Industry Association, led by Chairman Hikobe Komao, arrived in Shanghai on the Shanghai Maru on the 5th and stayed at the Towa Yoko. According to Chairman Hikobe, the export of textiles from Kiryu City to Manchuria has been very large recently, and sales are growing. However, the situation in Manchuria is the same as that of the Chinese people. This time, they came to China to study the psychology of the Chinese people and conduct on-site inspections of textile production areas in Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other places. After the inspection, they will be able to cater to the preferences of the Chinese people in order to imitate styles and dump goods in China after returning to their country.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Last Year's Tung Oil Exports Increased Sharply <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Commodity Inspection Bureau Releases Report on Reasons</p>
<p>The Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, considering that Chinese merchants have not paid attention to improving the quality of foreign trade and often adulterate goods, resulting in a decline in reputation, has specially followed the inspection procedures and requires all export goods to be inspected separately according to the regulations. Last year, after the Bureau's inspection of tung oil, the report showed that exports accounted for 100,000 metric tons, or about 160,000 dan in the old unit, which is the most seen in history. In 1933, it was 33,000 dan, which had increased by more than three times compared to 1932. Last year, it exceeded four or five times. The reasons released by the Commodity Inspection Bureau are recorded as follows: Last year, Zhejiang produced more tung oil, totaling 160,000 to 170,000 dan. However, due to the impact of rural bankruptcy, domestic sales were sluggish, and the spring market price was 3 to 4 yuan lower than in Hankou. Therefore, foreign merchants purchased Zhejiang oil in Shanghai, and the export volume was therefore larger than in previous years. Subsequently, due to the reduction in inventory in Shanghai and Hangzhou, the price began to resemble Hankou in June and July. In August and September, the Shipping Industry Europe-America Association reduced freight rates, and foreign merchants took the opportunity to purchase, and the market price rose to 33.6 yuan. In October, freight rates increased, exports were scarce, and the market price was also flat, falling to 28 yuan. However, there was not much inventory in the producing areas, so there were not many transactions. In November, new oil was put on the market. Due to drought, the harvest was generally only 50% to 60%. Most of the arrived goods had insufficient refractive index and could not pass the inspection for export, so oil merchants did not dare to sell. Foreign firms only traded slightly. The prices in Hankou and Changde were therefore low. This is the general reason for the increase in tung oil exports last year compared to previous years.</p>

<p>Capital of 7 Million, Jointly Operated by Government and Merchants</p>
<p>Training Center to be Established in This City to Recruit Students</p>
<p>According to Guomin She, the Jiangxi Provincial Government, recognizing that the porcelain industry in the province is sticking to old ways and has not been improved, resulting in a sharp decline in business, and that it has been mostly captured by foreign goods when it used to be the main export of China, has hired porcelain expert Du Chongyuan to investigate and propose improvement plans. The reporter of Guomin She specially visited Mr. Du to inquire about everything. According to him, the Jiangxi Provincial Government has decided to establish a large-scale porcelain company to improve Jiangxi porcelain, named Guangda Porcelain Company, with a fixed capital of 7 million yuan, jointly operated by the government and merchants. The government shares account for 2 million yuan, as determined by the Jiangxi Provincial Government, and the merchant shares account for 5 million yuan, to be raised in Shanghai. It is expected that all the funds can be raised within March. After the company is established, it plans to use scientific methods to improve the porcelain industry and plans to establish a Porcelain Industry Administration Bureau in Jiangxi to coordinate the improvement of porcelain factories and the porcelain industry.

<p>Yang Xiaobo Appointed as Manager</p>
<p>Banknotes to be Issued After Formal Opening</p>
<p>In order to adjust the financial situation in Sichuan Province and facilitate the merchants and people, Mr. Kong Xiangxi, President of the Central Bank, appointed Yang Xiaobo, Deputy Director of the Issuing Bureau of the Bank, to go to Chongqing last year to organize a branch. At present, the preparations for the branch have been completed. President Kong has officially appointed Mr. Yang Xiaobo as the manager of the Chongqing Branch. The internal staff has also been finalized and will be transferred from the head office. In order to adjust the financial situation in Sichuan Province, the branch plans to extract 10 million yuan from the old exchange coupons, add the words "Chongqing," and distribute it to the Chongqing Branch. The procedure for adding the words has been completed. The reporter of Xinxin She visited Mr. Yang Xiaobo at the Central Bank yesterday and asked about the opening date of the Chongqing Branch. He replied that the head office hopes that the Chongqing Branch can open as soon as possible. However, due to the inconvenience of transportation between Shanghai and Chongqing, transportation is extremely difficult. The branch needs about 20 to 30 staff members, all of whom are transferred from the head office. The ship travel is slow, and it is difficult to arrive in time. In addition, all kinds of account books and the branch's exchange coupon reserve fund must also be transported from Shanghai. The loading procedures must be extra cautious. Therefore, he has been in Shanghai for several days to contact various parties to solve transportation problems. If there is no suitable solution, he may telegraph Chairman Liu Xiang of Sichuan to send a warship to pick them up. As soon as the staff and all kinds of application items are transported to Chongqing, it can be officially opened. It is expected that the earliest time will be in early March.</p>

Unexpectedly, when the rickshaw passed the Guandi Temple on Zhaojiabang Road inside the old Ximen, a bandit suddenly jumped out of the roadside, intercepted the woman, forcibly snatched a gold earring from her ear, and ran into the center of the alley towards Hederi on Jingxiu Road to escape. It happened to be seen by policeman Gai Yushan, who saw him running away in a panic. He was intercepted. Just as he was being questioned, Zhang Chen shouted wildly to catch the thief and also followed. She identified the bandit as having robbed a gold earring at the above-mentioned location. Therefore, Gai Yushan found the stolen goods on the bandit's body on the spot and took him to the police station together. After questioning by the director of the police station, Tang Qianhuan, the robber confessed, "Jiang Fulin, 36 years old, from Danyang, lives at No. 37, Mingde Lane, Houjie, French Concession. He used to run a noodle shop, but is now unemployed. I have taken this wrong step, please forgive me." Director Tang, because the case was a daylight robbery, in addition to returning the stolen goods to Zhang Chen for receipt, he also ordered a document to be prepared and sent to the General Bureau for handling.</p>

<p>Wang Murders Yongde over Drinking Spree</p>
<p>Yongde Dies Unjustly</p>
<p>Jiang Yongtai and Yongde, two brothers from Shandong Province living at No. 19, Lane 60, Yangjiazhai, Pudong, are both laborers at the Xiangsheng Iron Factory in Lujiazui. At 6:00 p.m. on the 2nd of this month, they were invited by a friend surnamed Zhang to Zhang's house for New Year's Eve dinner. Yongde also brought his son. Yongtai, because of his nephew, gave Yongde's son two silver dollars as New Year's money. The child was only ten years old and was playing with the silver dollars in his hand when he suddenly lost one dollar. Yongde discovered this and looked for it with a candle, but to no avail. At that time, Wang Dui, another Shandong native who worked in the same factory as Yongde and was known to him, was also present. He was drunk from drinking and was very unhappy to see Yongde searching for it. He thought that one yuan was not worth making such a fuss about. He scolded Yongde with harsh words. Yongde had no place to vent his anger and became even more resentful when he heard this. The two started arguing, then fighting. Wang Dui felt that he was losing out and left in a rage. He went outside to get a knife and ran back to retaliate. He happened to see Yongde standing at the door and, taking him by surprise, slashed Yongde on the left face, cutting deep into his brain. Yongde was injured and fell to the ground. Wang saw that he had achieved his goal and ran away without a trace. Yongtai quickly sent his injured brother to Pudong Hospital for treatment. Due to his serious injuries, he died late at night. After the incident, the Third Detachment of the police was informed and sent police to Wang's house to wait. At 1:00 a.m., Wang suddenly sneaked home and was caught and taken to the Pudong Public Security Bureau for questioning. The next morning, the bureau summoned the local guarantor, Lu Shunlong, to report to the local court. After sending someone to inspect the body, he ordered the body to be handed over to the family for collection. The murderer, Wang Dui, was sent to court for legal proceedings.</p>

<p>On January 20th of the Gregorian calendar, a large whale about 46 to 47 feet long and weighing about 25,000 to 26,000 catties was suddenly found stranded on the beach in Chongming County, Jiangbei (at Lao Yaokou). The township head, Lu, sent a telegram to the Director of the Municipal Animal Institute of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education. The Director negotiated with the Bureau of Education to offer a price for the purchase and asked Mr. Yu Aichen, the factory director of the First Factory of the Oriental Books and Instruments Company, to send personnel to prepare it, preparing to make a specimen. In addition, another skeleton specimen was made. It is now heard that the whale has been shipped from Chongming to Shanghai and will be displayed at the First Factory of the Oriental Manufacturing Company in Gaochang Temple tomorrow. More than a dozen famous preparation experts, such as Liang Shanjiao and Lin Chaopin, have been hired to start work. However, this preparation requires a lot of labor and may take a month to complete.</p>

<p>China Huamei Tobacco Company has always been praised for revitalizing industry and serving society. Its Guanghua, Maisigan, and Ginseng brand cigarettes have long been popular and widely sold. Last year, the company's General Manager, Jing Yimeng, returned after inspecting the national goods industry throughout the country. He realized that although domestic cigarettes had produced various grades to meet the needs of society, there was still a lack of high-end cigarettes, which was not a way to promote domestic goods and plug the leaks. Therefore, the company collected the most expensive raw materials and used scientific methods to manufacture "Longevity Brand" name brand cigarettes, taking the meaning of "Happy Flowers, Full Moon, Longevity and Abundant Harvest." The tobacco silk of this cigarette is yellow and tender, the taste is sweet, and the golden decoration is the top grade of domestic cigarettes.</p>

<p>More than 80 people including Chinese Director Yuan Lvdeng attended</p>
<p>Macy Reports on the Organization's Progress and Mission</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, together with rickshaw merchants and pullers, organized the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association, which held its opening ceremony at the headquarters on Dong Jiaxing Road at 2:00 PM yesterday. A total of more than 80 people attended, including the association's directors Macy, Wang Zhiren, Zhu Cheng, Yin Zhiling, Chinese Director Yuan Lvdeng, and rickshaw puller representatives. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e173">Opening Ceremony <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>The venue was located in the auditorium of the headquarters on the upper floor of the small vegetable market at the intersection of Dong Jiaxing Road and Fengtian Road. A horizontal banner reading "Inauguration Ceremony of the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association" was hung in front of the door. In the middle of the auditorium were hung the national flag of China and the association's emblem. Flags of various countries around the world were hung around the perimeter, and the stage was decorated with flowers and trees. The arrangement was neat. Around 2:00 PM, the directors and rickshaw pullers arrived one after another, and the ceremony began. First, Chairman Macy reported on the progress of the organization, followed by speeches by Chinese Director Yuan Lvdeng, Shanghai University President Liu Zhanen, and YMCA General Secretary Lu Ganchen. Finally, rickshaw puller representative Zhu Liuhe gave a speech. The meeting adjourned around 4:00 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e174">Chairman's Report <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Macy's report briefly stated: "Distinguished guests, I am extremely pleased that you have attended today's opening ceremony of the headquarters of this association. On behalf of the board of directors of this association, I would like to express my welcome and gratitude to everyone. The origins of this association can be traced back to July of last year, when the Public Concession's Rickshaw Affairs Committee wanted to improve the lives of public rickshaw pullers, because their lives were extremely painful and they did not enjoy the welfare that human beings in modern civilized society should enjoy. This situation was explained in great detail in the report of the Rickshaw Research Committee published by the Public Concession a year ago. The Rickshaw Affairs Committee was entrusted by the board of directors of the Public Concession to be responsible for the implementation of the recommendations of the Rickshaw Research Committee approved by the board of directors. There are still many problems at present, but today my purpose is not to report to you in detail how much the committee has done on the recommendations of the Rickshaw Research Committee, or how much is yet to be done, and what it hopes to do in the future, but rather what the purpose of the committee's initiation of this association is. The Rickshaw Affairs Committee felt that it had the mission of planning to improve the lives of rickshaw pullers and should establish a social insurance plan to reduce the suffering of rickshaw pullers and their families due to injuries. Although there are already many charitable organizations in the concession that are also engaged in this type of work, most of them are limited by their financial resources and can only touch on the periphery. At the same time, we feel that to accomplish anything, we must have reliable funding, so we have decided that the only way is to take it out of the pockets of those who benefit. In general, this seems difficult to implement, but it so happened that the establishment of this association coincided with the Public Concession's reduction of rickshaw rents. Because the Public Concession decided at that time that the daily rickshaw rent must be reduced by about 25%, we thought that it might be possible for the rickshaw pullers to take out a certain amount of money from their own pockets every day to manage welfare services for them. However, most rickshaw pullers lack knowledge, and it is difficult to ask them to organize themselves and manage their own affairs, so we also thought that others should help them and manage things they cannot do themselves. Speaking of which, I feel very happy that the Public Concession thought of the benefits of establishing this association at that time, resolutely and happily advocated compliance, and was willing to help collect the mutual aid fees from the rickshaw pullers, and promoted the current effective and perfect method of collecting money. However, I feel that I must state here that the Public Concession has no economic responsibility for this association. The method of collecting membership fees from rickshaw pullers is that the rickshaw owners first pay 1.5 yuan per month per rickshaw on behalf of the rickshaw pullers, and the Public Concession then allows the rickshaw owners to collect an additional seven cents of foreign currency from the rickshaw pullers every day. The rickshaw owners pay the money directly to the bank selected by this association, not to the Public Concession. However, when the Public Concession issues licenses to the rickshaw owners every month, the rickshaw owners must first present the bank receipt for the mutual aid fee that has been paid before they are allowed to issue it. At the same time, the Public Concession also has a kind of power of safekeeping and supervision over the finances of the mutual aid association. According to the articles of association of this association, the safekeeping committee members of this association must be appointed by the Public Concession. All expenses of this association must be approved by the safekeeping committee members before they can be paid. Later, the Public Concession recommended three current members of the Rickshaw Affairs Committee to serve as the first three safekeeping committee members of this association. The first duty of the safekeeping committee members is to invite people from the society who are enthusiastic about this kind of welfare work to organize a board of directors. We have already succeeded in this matter, but this is mostly thanks to the participation of enthusiastic people, and in the past six months, they have actively assisted in the establishment of this association. In my capacity as chairman, I would like to thank them." (The rest omitted)</p>
<h3 id="e175">Headquarters Facilities <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>The headquarters of the Mutual Aid Association is located on the second floor of the small vegetable market on Dong Jiaxing Road. The top is triangular and occupies a large area. Most of the buildings are used as dormitories for rickshaw pullers, with three large rooms, each equipped with double iron beds, mattresses, sheets, and quilts. The rest are divided into classrooms, auditoriums, clinics, bathrooms, recreation rooms, conference rooms, meeting rooms, offices, doctor's rooms, infant bathrooms, baby bathrooms, laundry rooms, washrooms, and storage rooms. The facilities are perfect, and it is stipulated that the lodging fee for rickshaw pullers is 60 cents of silver per month, 20 cents of silver per week, and 10 copper coins per day.</p>

<p>The exchange rate of silver dollars to copper coins in this port was once over 3,300 wen per dollar last year, and silver dimes also reached around 12 dimes and 400 wen. Later, after a period of decline, it fell to 3,000 wen at the Customs, and then gradually increased until February 2nd of this month, when each silver dollar could be exchanged for 3,125 copper coins, and silver dimes could be exchanged for 12 dimes and 256 wen (calculated according to the market rate). Unexpectedly, the next day (i.e., Lunar New Year's Eve), at around 10:00 AM, various tobacco and exchange shops received a report from the foreign exchange house stating that the market rate was 250,000 wen for every 100 yuan, so the retail exchange rate was 2,500 wen per dollar and 12.1 dimes and 100 wen per silver dime. For a time, various tobacco and exchange shops hung small exchange rate signs, with rates ranging from 2,450 wen to 2,700 wen per dollar and 12 dimes and 30-40 wen per silver dime. Double dimes were only exchanged for 400 wen. For a time, the market was so chaotic that the livelihood of the common people was unbearable.</p>

<p>The dedicated double-deck steel pontoon built by the Municipal Ferry Management Office of the Shanghai Municipal Government's Xingye Trust Company at the Bund on Beijing Road has been well-received by passengers since it was put into use on the 28th of last month. Moreover, because the number of passengers increased particularly during the Lunar New Year holiday, the terminal's well-equipped facilities and orderly management made it feel less crowded. For days on end, the number of people from all walks of life who came to visit during the holidays was endless. The office provided uniform reception and sent staff to guide and explain in detail. All visitors expressed satisfaction. It is reported that the terminal is the only building of its kind at sea, with a novel and sturdy structure, exquisite and magnificent equipment, and clean and tidy facilities. Furthermore, it faces the Huangpu River and is adjacent to the park on the left, with a quiet and secluded scenery and fresh air, which adds to its appeal. It is truly worth a visit for leisure during the holidays and convenience for suburban excursions.</p>

<p>Yesterday, an order was issued to the Transportation, Mechanical, and Police Departments</p>
<p>The Two-Way Railway Administration issued an instruction to the Transportation Department, Mechanical Department, and Police Department yesterday, stating: "Every year during the winter vacation, a large number of laborers in Shanghai often take the railway train back to their hometowns. During this winter vacation, the Transportation Department temporarily allocated vehicles and added special third- and fourth-class trains every night on the routes with particularly heavy passenger traffic between Shanghai and the towns, and dispatched personnel in advance to explain all the measures to the laborers in major factories. The Police Department dispatched additional senior police officers to do their best to maintain order, and the Mechanical Department was also able to arrange the required vehicles in the shortest possible time. This was largely due to the hard work of the personnel involved, which enabled these laborers to avoid the pain and danger of crowding. It is deeply gratifying and should be commended by a circular order to show encouragement. You are hereby notified."</p>
<h3 id="e179">Italian Sculptor Sues Socialite Tang Ying <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Obtained Tang's Photo Five Years Ago for Promotion</p>
<p>Recently Demanded 3,000 Yuan in Construction Costs, Sued in Court</p>
<p>Mrs. Li Zufa, Ms. Tang Ying, is the sister of Tang Yunlu, the secretary of Song Ziwen, the current standing committee member of the National Economic Commission, who was assassinated at the North Railway Station when he followed Song from Beijing to Shanghai in the past. She is known for her social skills, talent, and beauty, and has been praised as a social butterfly. Five years ago, when Ms. Tang's name was well-known, a sculptor named Shang Qi, an Italian who came to Shanghai from Europe, was still unknown and unremarkable after staying in Shanghai for a long time. No one cared about him, and his door was deserted. Moreover, the cost of living at sea was high, and his pockets were gradually depleted. He felt that it was not easy to live in Chang'an and sighed that he could not return home. Just when he felt trapped, he suddenly heard of Tang's name and thought that if he could obtain this beauty's patronage, he would be able to win the support of all sectors of society. Then, his art would be perfected by the person, and his profits would be guaranteed. Therefore, he obtained a photo of Ms. Tang through various channels, sculpted an image with plaster as the material, and there was no difference between the likeness and the real person. However, this sculpture was not initiated by Tang herself, so after giving the photo, she never asked about it and even forgot about it. Recently, the Italian suddenly sent a letter to Ms. Tang, informing her of the likeness and demanding a construction fee of 3,000 yuan. Tang believed that the original photo was given at the request of a certain person, which was difficult to refuse. Now, after several years, he has made an unexpected extravagant request, so she ignored it. The Italian then hired a lawyer to submit a complaint to the civil mediation office of the First Special District Court, requesting that Tang Ying be summoned to court for mediation. It is alleged that he has been in China for many years and specializes in sculpting stone statues. Five years ago, Tang entrusted him to sculpt a statue with her photo. At that time, because Tang and her husband, Li Zufa, were both well-known figures in society, there would be no problem with the construction cost, so he did not make an agreement immediately and started working. After the statue was completed, he notified her and repeatedly sent letters urging her to pay the price and pick up the statue, but she ignored him. The construction of this statue took several months, and the materials consumed were enormous. The mental energy expended was also immeasurable. Now, even if Tang does not pick up the statue, she should still pay the remuneration and material costs totaling 3,000 yuan. Therefore, he specifically applied for mediation in accordance with the law, requesting that she be ordered to pay. A mediation hearing was recently opened by Judge Zhao Guangju, and Tang Ying also hired lawyer Yang Ruinian to represent her. She stated the reason for giving the photo, saying that Shang Qi used Tang's beautiful appearance to sculpt a statue as an exhibit in order to increase its artistic value and develop his sculpting business. He first asked Tang for a photo as a model, not Tang asking him to sculpt according to the photo. If this work was indeed requested by Tang, why did she not pay the price or pick up the statue for several years, and how could Gao Qi be willing to allow Tang to delay for so long? Judge Zhao then questioned Gao Qi and found that the statements of the two parties were greatly contradictory and could not be reconciled through words. He then announced that the mediation was unsuccessful. Therefore, Gao Qi has now taken a further step and will formally file a lawsuit against Tang Ying.</p>

<p>Sheng Bingru, a native of Jingjiang, is about 40 years old and is currently a shipbuilding technician at the Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. He resides at No. 22 Cais Shou Lane, Julai Road, French Concession. Two years ago, he married a local woman, Mrs. Fang, as his second wife. On the 29th of last month, Mrs. Sheng Fang suddenly received a phone call at home. A man who claimed to be the editor-in-chief and manager of Gang Bao Newspaper, Hu Xiaodong, claimed in the phone that the newspaper had recently received a news article about Mrs. Fang's disreputable news, with a photo attached. If she wanted to stop the publication of this news, she could quickly discuss a solution, etc. Mrs. Fang was shocked and horrified, because she had always</p>

<p>And had never had any irregular behavior. She replied to Hu that if it was necessary to contact her, she was a woman who did not understand the ways of the world and could meet with her husband. The phone was then hung up. On the afternoon of the same day, at around 7:00 PM, Hu Xiaodong (27 years old, from Anhui) and his companion, advertising agent Zhu Wenhui (33 years old, from Ningbo), came to Sheng's house and met with Sheng Bingru to discuss the issue of publishing this news article. They presented a mimeographed news draft and a photo of a man and a woman. Sheng was shocked and hateful when he suddenly saw the draft and photo. He asked Hu and others to leave it behind and promised to reply tomorrow after discussion. Hu and Zhu</p>

<p>And left. Sheng showed the news draft and photo to his wife, Mrs. Fang, who swore to her husband that she had never taken a photo with a man in her life. At this point, Sheng Bingru realized that the arrival of Hu and Zhu was actually a deliberate attempt to extort money and damage his reputation. He dismissed it with a laugh. The next day, Hu and Zhu came to Sheng's house again to hear the reply. Sheng immediately reported it to the French police. Detective Qian Yumin and Detective Bao Zhong Benchang went to Sheng's house and arrested Hu and Zhu. According to Hu and others, this news article and photo were instructed by Li Yi (i.e., Li Jiaren, 32 years old, from Ningbo), the owner of Gu Xiang Wine Shop at No. 485 North Sichuan Road.

<h3 id="e183">Was Also Provided by Li <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Etc. The detectives immediately went to Gu Xiang Wine Shop at No. 485 North Sichuan Road in conjunction with the public police to arrest Li Yi and confiscated a set of Western-style clothes that Li wore in the photo. They also went to Gang Bao Newspaper at No. 20 Xiehe Lane, Pike Road, and copied the news draft and photographic copper plate and brought them back to the police station. Mrs. Fang recalled that 13 years ago, she had taken a photo with her neighbors, young sisters, Li's wife and Li's sister, etc., when they visited the City God Temple. Other than that, she had never taken a photo. She immediately tried to find the original photo and sent it to the police station for verification. The copper plate copied from Li's place</p>
<h3 id="e184">Was Exactly the Same <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The police chief immediately ordered Hu, Zhu, and Li to be detained and sent to the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court on the first day of this month. Judge Li Changnian interrogated them. First, he asked the three defendants for their names, hometowns, ages, and occupations. Then, the police lawyer Gu Shouxi stated the case, saying that the defendants were arrested for crimes such as attempted extortion, defamation, and intimidation. It was found that the third defendant, Li Yi, had committed a kidnapping case on January 16, 1929, which was investigated by the Provisional Court. The second defendant, Zhu Wenhui, had been arrested three times for smoking red pills. Because the police station still needs to conduct a detailed investigation and arrest fugitives, he requested a postponement and temporarily detain the defendants until the case is clarified before requesting a trial. He also presented the news draft, photo, and copper plate as evidence. Then, the plaintiff, Sheng Bingru, briefly described the Hu and Zhu defendants bringing the news draft and photo to</p>
<h3 id="e185">Discuss the Process <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>The court verified the report and ordered a postponement for another hearing soon. The defendants were returned to custody. Li Yi's defense lawyer requested that Li be allowed to be released on bail pending trial. The judge ruled that the police station had not yet filed a lawsuit in this case and that the case was still under investigation, and it was not yet determined whether it would be under the jurisdiction of the local or primary court, so bail could not be granted. The bailiffs took the defendants down and sent them back to the police station for investigation. The police station has completed the investigation. At 11:00 AM yesterday, Judge Li came to the Criminal Division and interrogated them. First, the police lawyer Fei Xizhen stated the police station's investigation process and filed a lawsuit in accordance with Articles 325 and 328 of the Criminal Law for crimes such as attempted fraud, defamation, and intimidation, requesting</p>
<h3 id="e186">Legal Trial <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Then, the plaintiff, Sheng Bingru, stated that the third defendant, Li Yi, and his wife, Mrs. Fang, were neighbors for many years. In June of last year, Li came to his wife to borrow several thousand yuan, because his wife's family was quite wealthy. At that time, his wife refused to agree. Li continued to call twice to borrow money, saying that if she did not agree, it would be detrimental to her reputation. However, his wife always told him everything in detail, so she also told him about Li's borrowing situation. Recently, on the 29th of last month, his wife suddenly received a phone call from Hu Xiaodong, who claimed to be the manager of Gang Bao Newspaper, saying that he had received a news article and a</p>
<h3 id="e187">Joint Photo <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Of his wife and Li Yi. So his wife replied that she would bring it to Mr. Sheng for discussion. After a while, the first defendant, Hu Xiaodong, and the second defendant, Zhu Wenhui, came with the news draft and photo. After his wife examined it, she was very surprised, because she had never taken a photo with Li Yi. However, his wife thought of the photo she had taken with Li's wife and sister at the Chenghuang Temple ten years ago when she was recovering from illness. At that time, his wife wanted to understand the facts and urgently looked for the previous photo, but it had been lost. She then went to Li's sister's place to obtain this photo, and only then did she understand that Li Yi had used</p>
<h3 id="e188">Scientific Methods <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>To splice his own photo with his wife's photo and create a photo of them together. He put his left hand on his wife's right shoulder, and then wrote a news article and sent it to Gang Bao Newspaper, hoping to extort money and destroy his reputation. Therefore, he reported it to the police station, and Chinese and Western detectives first arrested Hu and Zhu. However, Detective Bao asked him to send 50 yuan in banknotes to Hu and Zhu as a reward. Hu and Zhu refused to accept it. Detective Qian Yumin also reported that after the plaintiff reported to the police station, Western detectives and he went to his home to arrest Hu and Zhu, and then went to their newspaper office to copy a photographic copper mold and a draft paper.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Sent by Post Office <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Afterwards, Li Yi was arrested, and a set of Western-style clothes that looked like the clothes worn in the photo was found in Li's house and brought to court as evidence. When questioned, Hu Xiaodong confessed that he was the director of Gang Bao Newspaper and that the draft and copper plate were actually sent by the post office. After he observed that this article damaged the reputation of others, he first notified the plaintiff by phone. A woman answered the phone and asked him to go to Mr. Sheng's house at 7 or 8 o'clock to discuss the matter. So he and his staff member Zhu Wenhui went as scheduled and explained the situation to Mr. Sheng. At that time, Mr. Sheng said that this matter</p>
<h3 id="e190">Concerned Reputation <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>And that they should not publish it blindly. They could first ask Li Yi for the facts and then report back to him after Li replied. He also wrote a note with Li's address and gave it to him. He went to Li's house to ask Li, who completely denied it. He then went to Sheng's house again to state the process. Unexpectedly, Sheng wanted to send him a roll of banknotes, which he refused to accept. He was arrested by Detective Bao when he went out. Zhu Wenhui confessed that he was a staff member of Gang Bao Newspaper and that Hu asked him to go to Sheng's house to interview the facts that day. He did not dare to extort money. The rest of his testimony was the same as Hu's. Li Yi confessed that he did not know Hu Xiaodong and Zhu Wenhui at all and that he did not know anything about this photo and</p>
<h3 id="e191">News Article <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>The plaintiff's mother-in-law was his godmother. In May of last year, he asked the plaintiff's mother-in-law to join a share of the meeting because he was opening a coffee shop. He did not borrow money from the plaintiff's wife. The official asked, "Then why is there this joint photo?" Li replied that this photo was taken at school when he was 19 years old. He did not know how it was spliced with the plaintiff's wife. It was obvious that someone who was at odds with him was making trouble and slandering him. Moreover, he was very surprised when Zhu Wenhui from Gang Bao Newspaper came to investigate. At that time, he repeatedly told them not to publish it and asked for a clear investigation. Finally, after the defendants hired defense lawyers to defend them, the court announced the end of the debate and scheduled the sentencing for 9:00 AM on the 11th.</p>
<h3 id="e192">The Gu Liancheng Futures Cotton and Wheat Case Judgement <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Gu Ordered to Compensate Losses of Over 14,500 Yuan</p>
<p>Contract Specifies Delivery of Actual Goods, Not Fictitious Trading</p>
<p>Gu Liancheng, a wealthy merchant from Nanxun, signed three futures cotton and wheat contracts with the American company, Meisheng &amp; Co., in September of last year. The contracts stipulated that if the market price decreased before the due date and the buyer failed to pay the margin and sell, the account could be closed at any time, and the buyer would be liable for the losses in full. By mid-November, the company claimed that the prices of cotton and wheat had both fallen, and Gu had failed to pay the margin. Therefore, they closed the account, resulting in a loss of over 14,900 yuan, and filed a lawsuit against Gu for compensation. The First Special District Court summoned the parties and ordered the plaintiff to submit the bills for further review, as reported previously. Recently, Judge Shen Hong held another hearing. The plaintiff's lawyer presented the American</p>
<h3 id="e193">Cotton and Wheat Market Price <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>telegram from November 17, a newspaper published in Chicago containing wheat prices, a letter from the Zhejiang Industrial Bank regarding the US dollar to national currency exchange rate, and the articles of association of the American Exchange. They claimed that the plaintiff, acting as a broker of the American Exchange, accepted Gu's commission to place orders, and all procedures were carried out according to the exchange's regulations. The contract clearly stated the intention to deliver actual goods, and it was by no means fictitious trading. The defendant's defense was untenable, they said. The defendant's lawyer, Yang Linzhi, stated that the bills and other documents submitted by the plaintiff were not official market price reports from the New York Stock Exchange and were difficult to believe. However, this was merely a factual dispute, not the</p>
<h3 id="e194">Main Defense <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>The most important reason the defendant requested the dismissal of the plaintiff's entire lawsuit was that the contract was purely a gambling act. All three contracts stipulated that the buyer should first pay a margin before the seller could place an order on their behalf. If the margin was not paid in advance, there was no obligation to place an order, and the contract could not be considered valid. Since the defendant had not paid the margin stipulated in any of the contracts, the contract was clearly not established, and the plaintiff had no obligation to place an order on their behalf. Moreover, the contract contained gambling characteristics and resembled exchange activities, such as the</p>
<h3 id="e195">Cotton Contract of September 4 <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>The delivery date was the end of March, more than half a year away, which did not comply with the exchange's regulations that futures contracts should not exceed six months. The lawyer then cited precedents from the former Dali Court and the Supreme Court regarding fictitious trading and gambling speculation, as well as Article 4 of China's Exchange Law, which prohibits foreigners from establishing exchanges or acting as brokers. He requested that all three contracts be declared invalid. Finally, he solemnly stated that China's economic development was hindered by foreign merchants relying on unequal treaties to engage in economic aggression. For example, foreign-owned banks were not subject to China's</p>
<h3 id="e196">Legal Restraints <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>This prevented the government from implementing a unified economic policy. Now, in addition to banks, exchanges were being established, enticing national dignitaries to speculate and gamble abroad, which was truly heartbreaking. Therefore, although the amount in dispute in this case was very small, it had a huge impact on the future and should be carefully considered, and the contracts should be declared invalid, he concluded. The plaintiff's lawyer, Feisi, immediately refuted this, stating that the case did not involve foreigners operating an exchange in China, but rather Chinese people commissioning foreigners to place orders abroad, which had nothing to do with China's Exchange Law. Transactions of this nature were common, and free trade was not subject to any restrictions. If the transaction in this case was deemed illegal, it would be</p>
<h3 id="e197">Too Far-Fetched <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>The various precedents cited by the defendant were also inconsistent with the facts of the case. In short, the contract contained a "genuine intention to deliver goods," a clear stipulation that proved it was not fictitious trading and did not involve gambling speculation. Because the defendant's attitude was malicious, the plaintiff, in order to prepare for defense, requested that when the judgment was announced in favor of the plaintiff, immediate execution should be declared to avoid difficulties in future execution, he said. The defendant's lawyer immediately opposed the application for immediate execution, adding that</p>
<h3 id="e198">There Was Once a British Merchant <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Who had a dispute with the Gold Exchange in the British office in this port. The British official ruled that he did not recognize China's Exchange Law. Now, the plaintiff, acting as a broker of the American Exchange, was involved in a lawsuit in our court, and we could also invoke the precedent of not recognizing the American Exchange Law. The plaintiff's lawyer continued to argue for a long time. As a result, Judge Shen declared the debate closed and adjourned for deliberation. At 2 p.m. yesterday, the date for the judgment was announced, and the lawyers representing both sides were present. Judge Shen then ascended the bench and announced the judgment, ordering the defendant to compensate the plaintiff for the loss of 14,508 yuan and to bear the litigation costs. The</p>
<h3 id="e199">Reasons for the Judgement <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>were then summarized and announced, stating that the ordering contract signed by the two parties clearly stated that there was an intention to deliver actual goods upon maturity, which was clearly not fictitious trading. However, because the delivery period was long, the plaintiff stipulated in the contract that the margin should be increased to provide protection and avoid losses in the event of a price decline before maturity. This could not be hastily regarded as fictitious trading. Meisheng &amp; Co. was commissioned by Gu Liancheng to place orders in the United States, so Meisheng acted as Gu's agent. Moreover, the</p>
<h3 id="e200">Goods Transaction <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>took place in the United States, so China's Exchange Law did not apply. Therefore, the loss claimed by the plaintiff was proven by the plaintiff's submission of accounts and should be deemed valid. The defendant, Gu Liancheng, should be held liable for compensation according to the contract. As for the plaintiff's request for the defendant to pay interest of over 400 yuan, the court, after investigation, considered it inappropriate and rejected this part of the request.</p>
<h3 id="e201">The Dredging Bureau Ordered a Large Dredger from Germany to Come to Shanghai <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Scheduled to Depart from Danzig, Germany on the 8th</p>
<p>The Dredging of the Shentan Project Can Begin Immediately</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reported that the world's largest dredger ordered by the Shanghai Dredging Bureau from Germany has been completed and is scheduled to depart from Germany on the 8th of this month to Shanghai. A Datong News Agency reporter learned that the dredger was ordered for dredging the Shentan outside the Wusongkou, which is closely related to the entry and exit of ships in this port. Yesterday, he interviewed Dr. Chatri, the chief engineer of the bureau, in detail and recorded the details below.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Sailing to China on the 8th <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>The large dredger was built by the German Schiar Shipbuilding Company. The Schiar Shipbuilding Company is the most famous shipbuilding company in Germany, with a machine factory in Elblng and a shipyard in Danzig. After the machine parts of the dredger were completed in Elblng last year, they were transported to Danzig to assemble the hull, which has now been completed. The bureau has also received a notice from the shipbuilding company that it is scheduled to depart from Danzig on the 8th of this month to Shanghai. The estimated journey will take about two months. At that time, Siemens, the agent for the ship, will deliver the goods.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Capacity and Speed <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>The ship was designed by Dr. Chatri, the chief engineer of the Dredging Bureau. The entire ship is 360 feet long and 60 feet wide. The speed is 11 miles per hour when sailing. The speed is only 2-3 miles per hour when fully loaded with mud. The draft is 11 feet when empty and 18 feet when fully loaded with mud. The amount of mud dredged per hour is 3,000 tons according to the contract. The cost is calculated in British pounds, but converted into Chinese currency, it is about 2.5 million yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Dredging the Shentan <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>The sole purpose of the Dredging Bureau ordering this large dredger is to dredge the Shentan outside the Wusongkou. The Shentan is located in the center of the Yangtze River estuary (about 20 miles from the mouth of the Yangtze River and has a large area). The depth is only 17 feet at low tide, so the Jianghai ships entering and exiting the Wusongkou are obstructed. Even Jianglun ships with shallow drafts cannot pass until high tide.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Completion in Five Years <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>After years of research by the chief engineer, it was determined that most of the Shentan was made of mud and could be dredged. Therefore, after the large dredger arrives in Shanghai, the depth at low tide will first be dredged from 17 feet to 26 feet, and the width will be 1,000 feet. The above dredging project is scheduled to be completed within five years, and dredging will continue to be carried out to achieve the plan of dredging a width of 20 miles. The mud dug up will be placed on a beach two miles away from the Shentan.</p>

<p>Guowen News Agency reported that the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, in order to address the loss of national tax revenue due to private cigarette manufacturing in various places, had submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance and jointly established the Cigarette Smuggling Assistance Committee with Shanghai Chinese cigarette manufacturers. Since its establishment, the committee has sent personnel to various places to investigate private cigarette manufacturing organizations and the lives of hand-rolled cigarette smokers. It has also found that the cigarette paper sold by British and American merchants is indeed Japanese. Because Japanese merchants do not sell openly, they are distributed by British and American merchants, and the price of the paper has increased accordingly. Chinese merchants cannot bear the pressure, so the committee has come forward to purchase directly from Japanese merchants. Recently, in order to fully understand the manufacturing and transportation of Japanese cigarette paper, the committee specially sent its advisor, Wu Chengtingsheng, to Japan for investigation to learn from their experience.</p>

<p>The Qiyuan Buddhist Association on Annakin Road in the French Concession has been holding winter relief activities for many years, with the association and Xuan raising funds to set up a porridge kitchen at the Yongxitang address in Xieqiao to provide relief to the common people. This year, it continues to follow the old example and provide relief as usual. Since its opening, the number of people receiving porridge has been increasing daily, reaching more than 10,000. There is less porridge than people, and those who arrive later are given half a catty of white rice. About 20-odd dan of rice are burned every day to make porridge and distribute rice. Because the location is narrow and there are too many common people, it is not enough to accommodate them, and there are fears of danger. On the 23rd day of the twelfth lunar month, the number of people suddenly increased greatly, and the crowds were extremely crowded. The association, fearing the difficulty of management and the lack of funds, had to temporarily suspend operations and discuss better solutions. Later, the great philanthropist He Zhongxiao suggested that the association should continue to distribute rice vouchers at the end of the year, as in previous years, to help the common people get through the year. It was decided to distribute rice vouchers as usual on the 27th day of the twelfth lunar month. More than 8,000 people, large and small, received the vouchers. The association sent many staff to take care of the different sections, and the order was very orderly. The director of the factory, Yu Yuanjue, and Ping Liantang have been consulting with various Xuan and philanthropists to discuss the continuation of the spring relief porridge distribution method, which is still scheduled to be open as usual, which is a blessing for the common people of Hunan in Shanghai. However, the association's financial resources are weak, and the cost of distributing porridge is extremely high. It is hoped that the wealthy gentlemen in Shanghai will generously donate and work together for this good cause. The merit will be immeasurable.</p>

<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau believes that the general public tends to indulge in gambling during the Lunar New Year due to habit. As a result, gamblers take the opportunity to profit and cause harm. Therefore, yesterday, it issued instructions to all sub-bureaus and police stations to strictly prohibit gambling. The document stated, "Gambling is the greatest harm to the local area. Ruin, dissipation of time, and unemployment all stem from this. The adverse effects lead to bandits and affect public security. However, every Lunar New Year, the folk custom of crazy gambling has not changed. It should be strictly prohibited to reverse this decline. In addition to the separate order, all must comply and promptly issue a notice prohibiting gambling. This order."</p>

<p>Sentenced to Imprisonment and Fines</p>
<p>The Gan Tai Candy Company on Megao Bao Road in the French Concession, the Ri Xin Coffee Company in Nanshi, Yu Huanzhang, Yang Jiyou, and others used the names "Yixing Jinxing" and "Xingxing" for coffee and tea, falsely claiming to be the Xingxing brand coffee and tea produced by the Guangzhou Company of Dongxinqiao, and selling them in the market. On the 29th of last month, the case was transferred to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, and Judge Sun Penghang still presided over the hearing. The police filed a public prosecution through lawyer Fei Xizhen. The judgment was announced on the morning of the 6th, and the defendant Yang Jiyou was sentenced to three months in prison and fined 200 yuan for forging the Xingxing coffee and tea trademark with the intention of deceiving others. The "Yixing Jinxing" and fake Xingxing signs and printing plates were confiscated. The Gan Tai Candy Company was fined 300 yuan for knowingly selling counterfeit Xingxing brand coffee and tea, falsely claiming to be produced by the Guangzhou Company. If dissatisfied, they may appeal. The plaintiff, represented by lawyer Xu Qinfu, requested compensation for losses of 3,000 yuan, and the case was transferred to the civil court.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Agricultural Products Lag Behind, Imports Exceed Exports, Except for Horticultural Products, Which Have a Large Export Surplus <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>The Total Export Value Reaches 19,104,26 Guanliang</p>
<p>However, Transportation and Packaging Methods are Defective and Must be Improved</p>
<p>China is an agricultural country, with farmers accounting for about 80% of the population. The cultivated area is 1,248,781,000 mu. However, the agricultural products produced are not enough for consumption. According to customs statistics, the amount of rice, wheat, flour, etc. imported each year is extremely large. However, vegetables and horticultural products have a large export surplus, with the total export value reaching more than 19.1 million Guanliang each year. This is very gratifying. A Zhonglian News Agency reporter found out the customs statistics as follows. It is reported that from 1927 to May 1931, the average value of imported oranges, fresh fruits, pepper, apples, raisins, agar, other fresh fruits, and confectionery materials, fragrant mushrooms, betel nuts, star anise, longan, lemons, asparagus, dried tangerine peel, lychees, other unlisted fruits, vegetables, spices, nuts, etc. was 9,770,052 Haiguan taels. The total export value of vegetable seeds, walnut kernels, dried walnuts, fresh salted vegetables, almonds, fresh fruits, garlic, melon seeds, oranges, unlisted dried fruits, confectionery, fragrant mushrooms, daylily, canned vegetables, red cabbage, potatoes, fruits, and other horticultural products was 19,104,261 Haiguan taels. In China's foreign trade, imports exceed exports in every category. Now, the export of vegetables and horticultural products actually exceeds imports, which is a great thing to celebrate. However, backward production technology, defective transportation and packaging methods, and inaccurate grading methods all pose a risk of existing products being rejected in foreign markets. It is hoped that domestic horticulturists will pay special attention.</p>

Since the various branches of the association began preparations one after another, the work has become more intense. The Shangnan branch, which was the last to begin preparations, also held a meeting on January 31, by the preparatory members Yang Hongyi, Lu Ziming, Qian Linhai, Cheng Kainan, Lu Xiaofu, etc., to decide on the next steps. Registration has now begun. As for the Wusong, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and Suzhou branches, through the efforts of the preparatory members, the registration procedures have been largely completed. The group leaders and branch secretaries have been elected one after another, and various branches have been established. Among them, the Wusong branch has the most, with six branches already established. The Changzhou, Shangbei, Zhakou, Jiaxing, and Ningbo branches are also dividing branches and appointing branch preparatory members, quickly handling the registration of members, and starting elections. They are not stopping for the Lunar New Year holiday. The reorganization office has been sending personnel to various branches to guide and assist, which is also extremely busy.</p>

The first prize was announced on January 25 as "Shi's Beauty Lotion." It has been decided to use this name from now on. Also, "Shi's Beauty Snow (i.e., high-quality vanishing cream) has also been launched. The quality is excellent and the fragrance is elegant. It is a unique color in the field of domestic cosmetics.

<p>This morning, several Chinese newspapers published reports that the India Mercalli Bank was about to liquidate. This statement is completely false. The fact is that the India Mercalli Bank and several other banks have petitioned the court to appoint a liquidator to handle the liquidation of a certain business that was insolvent. It is also said that the Mumbai manager of the business has passed away. As for the employees of Mercalli Bank, no one has died. We are deeply afraid of confusing the hearing and respectfully request your newspaper to publish this letter to clarify the truth. January 31 Shanghai Mercalli Bank Qi Press This newspaper also published this news, but the punctuation is clear and the wording is obvious, so a supplementary statement is made.</p>

<p>Hong Kong Says Shanghai Has Hope of Winning</p>
<p>But With Weak Strength, There May Be Little Certainty</p>
<p>The Shanghai Interport Football Team went south to Hong Kong this time for the annual Interport Games. Due to its weak strength and the inability of Dai Linjing, Sun Jinshun, Wan Xianghua, etc. to go south, the Interport Games on Lunar New Year's Day were defeated by Hong Kong by a large score of 7-1. In the first half, Hong Kong led 6-1. After Shanghai was scored two goals in a row by the Hong Kong team, it was fortunate to have a penalty kick opportunity, which was scored by Li Yichen, so as to avoid the humiliation of the entire army being wiped out. The Hong Kong team's scoring record is as follows: (1) Tan Jiangbai (2) Lie Li (3) Cao Guicheng (4) Hou He (5) Badu (6) Tan Jiangbai (7) Hou He. On the 5th, Shanghai played against the Hong Kong Chinese Federation. The generals of the Chinese Federation, Feng Jingxiang and Ye Beihua, did not play. Shanghai drew 2-2. Today, Shanghai's last game is against the Hong Kong Military Federation. According to Hong Kong's observations, it said that there is hope of winning, but it is feared that there is still no certainty. The weakness of the Shanghai team going south is probably no greater than this time. The details of the Interport defeat have been seen in yesterday's extra edition.</p>

<p>All Jiangnan Southbound Games Postponed</p>
<p>In the Western Youth Women's Basketball Championship, the Green team defeated the American Women's team 21-11 last night, creating a record of three wins in three games.

The team is tall, accurate in shooting, and agile in action. The championship is generally undoubtedly theirs. The Liangjiang team is going south to the Philippines. All games have been postponed. If the team can return within one month, we will find a way to make up the games. During the winter vacation, the results of all the association's competitions are summarized as follows:</p>

<p>The basketball team of Liangjiang Girls' Sports School in this city received a letter from the Philippine Chinese Overseas Sports Association, inviting them to participate in the carnival competition. This matter concerns international sports honor and is a great achievement for women. Principal Lu of the school immediately agreed to the request and departed from Shanghai yesterday morning on the President Jefferson. It is reported that the Liangjiang basketball team has previously traveled north to Tianjin, Shenyang, Dalian, and Qingdao, south to Min, Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Guangdong, and east to the three islands of Japan. Wherever they went, victory flags were displayed, which attracted the deep attention of people in those areas. Their contribution to promoting women's sports domestically and demonstrating the spirit of women's sports overseas is immense. Now, they have been invited to participate in a competition in the Philippines. Judging from their past efforts, they will surely bring glory to the country.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Principal Lu of the school believes that there are a large number of our overseas Chinese in the various regions of Southeast Asia, and it is difficult to understand the current situation of their education without personally visiting and conducting a detailed investigation. This time, he specifically traveled to the Philippines on the same ship as the school's basketball team, taking the opportunity to investigate and inspect the service of the school's graduates in Southeast Asia. During his absence from the country, the school affairs will be temporarily handled by Dean Zhang Yuansheng.</p>

<h3 id="e235">Chinese Modern Painting Exhibition Scheduled to Open in England <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>丨Starting February 11丨</p>
<p>The Embassy Hosts Two Tea Parties to Entertain Various Circles</p>
<p>Ambassador Guo Explains the Characteristics of Chinese Painting</p>
<p>Central News Agency, London Dispatch: Our country's artist, Liu Haisu, was dispatched by the government to Berlin two years ago to organize a Chinese art exhibition, which won much praise. Many European countries urged Mr. Liu to conduct a traveling exhibition, which successively took place in more than ten major cities such as Hamburg, Rhine, The Hague in the Netherlands, Amsterdam, Geneva in Switzerland, Berna, Prague, etc. Guo Taiqi, our country's ambassador to England, believed that the works collected by Mr. Liu this time were sufficient to represent the modern schools of painting in our country. Therefore, in March of last year, he telegraphed Mr. Liu to exhibit in England, and because London is a large city with a large population, and there are many oriental scholars, the promotion of our country's culture is of utmost importance. Later, because Mr. Liu had prior agreements with authorities in various countries, Mr. Liu did not arrive in England from Geneva until November of last year. After Mr. Liu arrived in England, he immediately designated New Burlington Gallery as the venue and visited artists and art critics, Courtauld Institute of Art of the University of London. Professor Constable, the director of the UniversitvofLondonCourtauldInstiluteofAct, highly respected Mr. Liu's work and provided him with various assistance. On December 12 of last year, Ambassador Guo invited Professor Yan You, Professor P. Yotts, Professor Adaws, Sir Donison Ross, and twelve others from the British University Committee to hold a preparatory meeting at the Chinese Embassy. It was decided that (1) the opening ceremony would be held on February 22, and the press and literary circles would be invited to visit on the 21st; (2) the Crown Prince would be invited to perform the unveiling ceremony; (3) the representative works would be displayed in the museum; on December 29, the diplomatic corps, literary celebrities, the press, and the academic community would be invited for evaluation; (4) Lord Halifax, the Minister of Education, would be invited to serve as the chairman, and Sir Wcllihne Denrlly, Countess Gasford, Sir James Lockhart, Professor Laurence Binyon, and Professor W.G. Conslable, etc. About twenty people were appointed as members. On December 29, Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi hosted a tea party at the Chinese Embassy to preview the Chinese paintings for various circles. More than 200 people attended, including ambassadors and ministers from various countries stationed in England, celebrities from the literary and press circles. Many were elderly, and some were middle-aged, all of whom were extremely enthusiastic and fond of Chinese art and very happy to attend the meeting and praise the famous Chinese paintings. Among the modern British literary and art critics, Laurence Binyon, who is insightful and has achieved the highest level of completion in the artistic field, is the most notable. He has written many books and is also the greatest poet. Regarding the criticism of Chinese painting, he has thoroughly published the philosophical thoughts and Chinese people's outlook on life in his book PaintinginheForEas t, as well as the typical historical figures. He also exceptionally appreciated Mr. Liu's works. Ambassador Guo has always enthusiastically supported the exhibition and has written a preface clarifying Chinese painting, saying that Eastern art is represented by China, Japan's culture is imported from China, and the historical timeline of its fine arts is only one-third of China's. Therefore, its paintings mostly echo the colors of China, but lack the charm of Chinese painting. Although India is an ancient civilized country, Buddhism has declined since the Tang Dynasty, and art has gradually declined as well. Therefore, to understand Eastern art, China should be taken as the representative. People in this country have realized this and have launched large-scale exhibitions to showcase ancient Chinese art and modern famous paintings separately. Now, the Chinese Modern Famous Painting Exhibition will open at the New Burlington Gallery on February 21. The main points are briefly described below:</p>
<p>The famous works collected this time were entrusted by the Chinese government to President Cai Yuanpei, Minister Ye Gongchuo, and Professor Liu Haisu, and are all masterpieces of ambassadors from various schools of painting in various parts of China, and Mr. Liu himself also has dozens of his own masterpieces. These works have been exhibited in Berlin, Hamburg, Dusseldorfer, Munich, The Hague, Amsterdam, Geneva, Berne, Paris, and other cities since January 1934 and have received good reviews.</p>
<p>Chinese painting not only focuses on depicting form, but also pays more attention to the expression of the soul. The painting schools mostly regard ink painting as superior, and the painting methods mostly focus on charm and vitality. The first item of the Six Principles is charm and vitality, which is indeed Xie He's insightful view. Art historians and critics of all dynasties have followed it. Although the interpretation of charm and vitality may not be the same in all schools, I will now give a most easily understood explanation, that is, the so-called "qi" refers to spirit, aura, flavor, and interest, that is, the author's own personality and feelings. The so-called "yun" is rhythm, the inner depth of taste. "Sheng" refers to the vitality of life. "Dong" refers to the spirit of movement, which is vivid and prominent. The Ming Dynasty painter Dong Qichang said, "Charm cannot be learned, it is naturally endowed. Read thousands of books and travel thousands of miles to barely learn it." What is the difference between a painting without charm and a camera? The charm of Chinese painting cannot be concealed and naturally appears on the surface of the brush and ink unintentionally. Realistic products of the photographic school have no charm at all and are not only mechanical functions but are also entirely at the mercy of nature, taking the eye as a lens and the heart as a darkroom. Works of art that focus solely on reality are dry and tasteless, so what is the difference between them and a camera? Therefore, Chinese painters are mostly literati who can write and compose poetry, only then can they become masters. From the cultivation of books and poetry flows out purity and uniqueness, flowing out the wonderful taste of intention reaching beyond the brush. Su Dongpo of the Song Dynasty said, "When he puts down his brush, the wind and rain are swift, and the spirit has swallowed what the brush has not reached," that is what it means. Furthermore, in China, not only can painters write and compose poetry, but also the famous politicians of all dynasties can write poetry, paint, and write calligraphy, and some great painters are also politicians, such as Wang Wei and Li Sixun of the Tang Dynasty, Su Dongpo of the Song Dynasty, Zhao Ziyang of the Yuan Dynasty, and Gai Qichang of the Ming Dynasty, are the most prominent examples. "The so-called 'poetry in painting and painting in poetry'" means that poetry, literature, and painting are closely related. This tradition has continued to this day, and this is also a unique phenomenon in Chinese culture.</p>
<p>I am now holding a festival in this country and promoting Chinese culture is my duty. I will briefly describe the special points of Chinese painting as an introduction for the audience. As for what the exhibits are like, it is still up to the experts to evaluate. Guo Taiqi, Ambassador Plenipotentiary to England.</p>

<p>The case of shortening school holidays and shortening the school year proposed by President Sun of the Legislative Yuan, etc., was previously submitted by the Executive Yuan to the Ministry of Education for review and reply. The Ministry of Education considered that the matter concerned changes to the school year, semester, and holiday dates and should be studied in detail by major educational conferences, education departments, and educational research groups.

<p>The Ministry of Education issued an order to the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities, stating that the statistics of the social education funding amounts reported by various provinces and cities for the 23rd year have been completed. It is calculated that the following eight regions have reached the standard amount: Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Guangxi, Fujian, Henan, Nanjing, Weihaiwei, and the three provinces of Shaanxi, Hubei, and Suiyuan, and Qingdao City. Although they have not yet reached the standard, they are all above 9%, not far from the standard amount. It is expected that they will reach the standard in a short period of time. In terms of the funding amount, Jiangxi Province increased by more than 200,000 yuan, Hubei and Guangxi provinces each increased by more than 100,000 yuan, and Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, and Hunan provinces each increased by more than 30,000 yuan. The educational administrative agencies in the respective provinces and cities have made efforts in fundraising and are commendable. As for the percentages of other provinces, some are close to the standard, and some are far away. They should all effectively increase their funding in the next year to meet the needs. In addition to compiling and printing a table and a sequence table of the above reporting materials and issuing them separately, 20 copies of the table and the sequence table of social education funding for the 23rd year of each province and city are enclosed for reference. Furthermore, the number of social education funding for the 21st and 22nd years of the counties and cities under the jurisdiction of the provinces has also been compiled into a table and a sequence table for reference.

<h3 id="e253">A Review of the Cotton Market in the Year 23 of Spun Yarn Flowers <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>Highest and Lowest Transaction Prices and Delivery Quantities of Zheng Biao</p>
<p>Arrival and Sales Volumes of Raw Cotton and Their Monthly Highest and Lowest Prices</p>
<p>The state of cotton in the 23rd year presented a rather active atmosphere in January. It advanced from a low peak towards a high peak. Upon investigating the reasons for its rise, it was said that the United States would forcibly control cotton production, and Penhaide also proposed a plan to limit cotton fields, with the output not exceeding 10 million bales. All kinds of news favored buyers. The meeting on the issue of the Japanese-Indian cotton industry reached a compromise. Indian cotton first tended to rise. On January 3rd, Broach cotton rose directly from 186 rupees to 215 rupees 25. American cotton rose from 1.045 cents to 1.175 cents. The world cotton industry unanimously rose, arousing the activities of speculators. Buyers gathered, and the atmosphere was once heated. Standard cotton rose from over 39 yuan to the highest price of 45 yuan and 10 cents for the May term on February 9th (per picul, based on the Sima scale). By the middle of March, April, and May, unexpectedly, a large tree attracted the wind, and high prices attracted distant customers. Inland sources were crowded, and arrivals increased. Hankou yellow-grade cotton was sold enthusiastically. Unfortunately, the spring sales of cotton yarn were disappointing again. The price of yarn was bleak, and manufacturers felt particularly difficult to operate. Shanghai's stock of yarn was substantial, and the market price was difficult to consolidate, and an unprecedented new low price of 163 yuan was discovered, forming an inverse proportion with the price of cotton. As a result, the cotton market, which was closely related, was constrained. At this time, the American and Indian cotton markets also rose, turning flat after the high. Yarn factories were becoming increasingly concerned about reducing working hours due to the high price of cotton and the low price of yarn. Indian cotton prices weakened further due to the strike of more than 20 yarn factories in Mumbai. Broach cotton fell back to 185 rupees on May 3rd. The low peak of standard cotton for the April term was 40 yuan and 65 cents. By mid-June, coarse yarn sales in North China suddenly became smooth. After the cotton price fell, factories needed to develop, and Shanghai's cotton stocks gradually became thin. Mr. Wang of Tongji Company, in view of the era of old cotton, and with the American and Indian cotton markets and the yarn market moving upwards, organized a very large bullish company. The rumor of short squeezing sang loudly, greatly exciting the weak and sluggish cotton market. The price increase of standard cotton intensified, and Japanese merchants were also in a bullish position. The highest price of standard cotton for the June term was 47 yuan and 55 cents, higher than the similar Indian cotton by 5 to 6 yuan, fully demonstrating the mighty power of the buyers. It was heard that the bullish company made huge profits. By mid-July, August, and September, since the beginning of summer, drought raged in the central provinces. Ponds and streams dried up, and fields cracked. Floods flooded the Northwest and Southwest. When the cotton trees were developing, they suffered such devastation. In addition, on July 1st, the central government implemented new tax regulations, increasing the import tax on cotton from 3.5 gold units per 100 kilograms to 5.0 gold units. With these two factors, the market's sentiment was激昂, and everyone was bullish. The high peak for the August term was over 38 yuan (per picul, based on the market scale). Subsequently, the US government's first estimate was released on August 8th, reducing the output to 9.195 million bales. However, the Shanghai market was unable to pick up. Because Tongcheng Company and Mr. Huang of a certain yarn factory vigorously threw out 100,000 to 200,000 piculs, firmly bearish on new cotton. Therefore, they sold short when American cotton rose, and the market suffered even greater pressure. The reason was that agricultural products were surprisingly cheap last year, but only the price of cotton was high. Farmers changed their crops, and the acreage must increase. The new cotton for the October term fell twice to 37 yuan and 10 cents, then turned downwards. For a time, people were extremely alarmed. On August 20th, the China Cotton Production Statistics Association reported that the acreage was 44,441,047 mu, an increase of 5,283,601 mu compared with the same period last year. As a result, the sellers' morale was even stronger. Afterwards, in mid-October, the United States implemented a policy of buying silver. The silver market soared, and the price of gold tended to shrink, which was unfavorable to our country's prices. During the period when new cotton entered the market, the pressure from sellers became stronger. Therefore, the market situation was unusually weak, with a long period of sideways movement. The lowest price of standard cotton was 33 yuan and 30 cents on October 7th. However, as prices fell, sources from all sides became scarce. Although the cotton stock in the Northwest was thick, most of the goods were absorbed by the cooperative. Another theory was that farmers were firmly determined to hoard and were unwilling to sell. Therefore, although the environment was bad, arrivals were scarce. On October 18th, the national government increased export taxes and added equalization taxes to prevent the outflow of silver. The price of gold soared, and all prices rose together. Paper money rumors rose repeatedly, and rumors of currency inflation were rampant. The market sentiment was greatly shocked. Tongcheng Company reversed from short to long, and the highest price rose again to over 38 yuan. The sharpness of the rise was rarely seen in the past. The situation in November and December slightly weakened. Because the price of yarn was suppressed by the low price of Japanese yarn, the cotton market wanted to rise but stopped. However, Tongcheng and Tongji companies purchased large quantities to go long, kept them closed. Also, because the Indian cotton harvest was poor and the short squeeze was severe, the price increase intensified. The high peak of standard cotton for the April term was once 38 yuan and 75 cents. Recently, the disease of yarn factories due to the high price of cotton and the low price of yarn has become increasingly serious. Cases of factories closing down because they could not maintain operations were heard from time to time, indicating the decline of the yarn factory industry. Cotton industry statistics The last estimate on November 15th showed that the output increased to 11,172,553 piculs, an increase of 1,398,346 piculs compared with the previous year. However, in reality, the price ratio of foreign cotton was too high, and speculators held on without moving. The price of cotton still maintained its outstanding state. The following table lists the highest and lowest prices and delivery prices and delivery quantities of standard cotton throughout the year for reference.</p>

<p>The Local Silk Market is on Holiday</p>
<p>With the US Gold Bar Bill still undecided and people unsettled, stock prices across the board are trending downwards. The silk market has also been considerably affected, so overseas actual sales dare not buy more, and hoarders are all watching and waiting. The Lyon side is even more unmoved, while in Shanghai, because the majority of export firms have not yet opened, silk shops and silk firms are also on holiday, so the silk market remains quiet. Red Plate trading will depend on tomorrow's (the 5th) market conditions.</p>
<h3 id="e260">Overview of Japanese Silk Production and Sales Statistics <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, the conditions in the Chinese silk market have followed Japanese prices as the standard for ups and downs, so Chinese silk merchants are extremely concerned about the Japanese silk situation. The production and sales situation for this term (June 1934 to May 1935) deserves attention due to poor production and increased demand. The following is a special introduction of the entire picture to readers, and the general silk industry should also review it.</p>
<p>Japanese Silk Statistics from June 1934 to the End of May 1935 (Unit: Bales)</p>
<p>(1) Production Section</p>
<p>Inventory In Japan 28,745 In the US 53,245 Unreeled Cocoon Combined Silk 42,345</p>
<p>Total Production This Term 669,121</p>
<p>Stored Production in Korea and Taiwan 25,000</p>
<p>Total 818,456 Bales</p>
<p>(2) Consumption Section</p>
<p>From June to December 1934 US Sales 251,699 Europe and Asia 43,197 Domestic Consumption 140,000</p>
<p>Estimated Consumption from January to May 1935 330,000</p>
<p>Total 764,896 Bales</p>
<p>The estimated quantity from January to May 1935 is extrapolated from the average of the previous seven months, which is 310,610 bales. In addition, with the recent increase in consumption in various countries, it is estimated that 330,000 bales can be sold, so the total consumption for this year is 764,856 bales. The difference between production and sales is 53,600 bales, which is the actual inventory when Japanese silk changes over from old to new this year. It can be seen that Japanese silk production is still excessive.</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm's New York Stock Market Report, yesterday (the 5th), showed a downward trend led by railroad stocks. This was because the railroad industry's expenditures were increasing daily, while income was not increasing. In addition, there was the issue of being taken over by government management, so everyone sold. Utility stocks were still strong in the morning, but then fell back because the Federal Trade Commission's report pointed out that utility companies used reorganization methods, including asset inflation, to avoid paying income tax to the federal government. Bonds, except for US government bonds, tended to weaken. Small exchange stocks also fell. The Chicago grain market rebounded at the close due to reports of a large storm in the Southwest. The total transaction volume for the day was 560,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left:</p>

<p>When Chicago wheat prices fell, external purchases also increased. The weather in the Southwest was dry, so the market's underlying strength has become slightly stronger.</p>

<p>Shanghai's various circles have officially designated this year as the Student National Goods Year. I believe it should be changed to the Teacher National Goods Year for it to be more practical.</p>
<p>Because students' words and actions usually follow those of their teachers; if teachers desperately set an example by using national goods and strictly train students to use national goods, the students' minds will naturally be deeply imprinted with the words "national goods" and they will reject foreign goods.</p>
<p>There is a local saying in our area that goes, "Hands don't move twenty-four," I don't know what it means, but judging from the tone, it's a description of people who refuse to work no matter what.</p>
<p>Therefore, I hope that everyone will do their duty this year, roll up their sleeves and work hard, really work hard to save the country, and not live up to this saying.</p>
<h3 id="e268">Casual Writing by the Snow Window <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— Huo Xueming</p>
<p>It has been raining for a few days, the weather is very warm. I thought that at the end of the lunar year, I would not see the sun again, and there would be no more river ice and snow. But a night of west wind swept away the dry leaves in the yard, the water tank froze into glass, the swimming shadows of the goldfish could no longer be seen, and even the snowflakes in the sky were flying vigorously.</p>
<p>The plum blossoms that were budding yesterday secretly bloomed with such charming red flowers in the wind and snow. I sat alone under the window, quietly searching for poetry material for the end of winter, only hearing the footsteps of several skylarks treading on the snowflakes, hearing the singing of the wind drifting from the wall, and also hearing the faint sound of my own heart beating.</p>
<p>Watching the red petals of the plum blossoms slowly disappear, the space is full of powder-like snowflakes, flying little by little, piling up in clusters, decorating the branches of the plum tree purely white, the whiter the fatter, the fatter the whiter. And the sparrows, unafraid of the cold, jump to the east, jump to the west, shake their necks, lower their heads to peck at the snow, take a bite, and then raise their heads to look around. That posture is truly leisurely, pleasant, and graceful!</p>
<p>Suddenly, a girl from the neighbor's house slipped out from the side door of the thatched cottage. She was wearing short boots and a white wool sweater, and walked lightly on the snow. Her bright black hair was stirred and waved by her bouncing steps. She quietly tiptoed after the sparrows, reaching out her hands as if to catch them. But before she could get close, the little sparrows, as if they had a sixth sense, pecked a piece of snow, flapped their wings and quickly flew up to the plum tree, turning around to chirp at the girl. The child stared at the tree eagerly, wishing she could grow wings. And a plum blossom happened to be pecked down by the sparrow, and in the child's eyes, it was caught by her, and she smiled.</p>
<p>The snow is getting heavier and heavier, and the child is walking in the snow, her whole body covered in a vast expanse of white flowers, only revealing half of her small face, which is red from the cold, with two shiny eyes and black, moist waves of hair covering her forehead. ········· The weather is already spring!</p>
<p>I saw all of this clearly from the gap in the window, but I didn't dare to cough once!</p>
<h3 id="e269">General Reaching Out <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Yu Sheng</p>
<p>As a rule, a general's hands should be used to hold a command knife and grab binoculars! Using them to play cards or hug women is already an insult to the general's hands! However, the General Reaching Out specializes in using his hands to ask people for money, and he can't even get thousands or tens of thousands of dollars. Think about how embarrassing this is for a "general"!</p>
<p>You sometimes have to wait at the tram stop for the tram, right? Then you should know the General Reaching Out! Although they can't track Wu Zixu and beg by playing the flute, they rarely go door to door begging. And unlike those who sing "Zheng Banqiao Tanhuang" and pretend to be noble by refusing to accept money with their hands, they honestly and impolitely reach out their hands to ask for money, their demeanor is quite dignified!</p>
<p>Some of the generals are missing hands, some are blind, and some are mute. Although their ranks are different, their "nailing skills" are equally brilliant! As long as they see you dropping a copper coin from a cigarette shop and running towards the tram stop, they are ready to greet you! Holding up half an arm or stumbling around and clinging to you. Of course you find it annoying, but you are waiting for the tram and can't leave the station, so you can only dodge your face left and right to avoid him, and he will flatter you from all directions, saying "May you get rich, sir!" You can't get angry, and the tram never arrives, so the cramped situation forces you to spend a small amount of money to get rid of him. This kind of money-grabbing skill is really tough! If it weren't tough, how could they be called "generals"!</p>
<p>"Nailing skills" sometimes need to be combined with "leg skills." I once had the honor of being escorted by a general from Ba Xian Bridge to West New Bridge, and only then was the "ceremony" completed and he retreated! Although I was flattered and felt uneasy at the time, thinking back now, being able to show off my leg strength in front of the general and give him a "longing sigh" is something to be proud of!</p>
<p>It is said that there are also "slogans" when generals use their "nailing skills." The purpose of the slogans is of course to ask for money. But when he encounters two women, he will shout "Two ladies, give one!" This is a bit outrageous! But the "two ladies" can't be bothered to argue with him, and he keeps shouting slogans from behind, so the copper coins clang to the ground, and the general politely "bows" and retreats!</p>

<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>In our house, there are no radiators, no stoves, not even a basic charcoal basin. It is a very spacious, old house, the doors and windows are not complete. In this harsh winter, the wind sharply penetrates the cloth curtains and the window frame holes where the glass is missing, causing the purple copper lamp with a white shell shade hanging in the middle of the living room to shake. Neighbors and relatives often worry about us. "Your house is too cold, isn't it!"</p>
<p>"Cold? I don't feel it."</p>
<p>"We still feel a little warmth!"</p>
<p>Every night, our whole family gathers in this house. Father brings his only confidant, the water pipe, from the shop, a mouth that always wears a smile hiding under a figure-eight mustache, comes back. Mother always happily reports on the day's events, what things in the vegetable market are expensive or cheap, and how pedestrians at the door fought and how she persuaded them to stop, with great enthusiasm. My younger brother and I arrive home no later than six o'clock. Sometimes we buy some things that our parents like to eat on the way back, and we also wrap some separately with our wives, intending to give it to them in the room at night.</p>
<p>We sit around a table for dinner, chat, read newspapers, talk about social news, everyone's mouths, eyes, and noses move in different ways. Sometimes, even our eyes laugh. We forget about this cold season, and we don't know the severity of the north wind.</p>
<p>What fills our spacious, old house is丨</p>
<p>The love of parents, the love of brothers, the love of husband and wife, so passionate!</p>
<p>"We are not cold, on the contrary, we still feel a little warmth."</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>He had this little idea, and he didn't want to gloss over it. He slept in the room for a while, sat for a while, quietly thinking about how he could borrow Cheng Zhiqian's power to find a good position that wouldn't get him beaten. He pondered for a long time and finally came up with a solution. Maybe the high-ranking director is at the banquet today. I'll write a note on the spot and have the tea boy give it to Cheng Zhiqian, asking him to introduce me to him. He received such a heavy gift from me today, he wouldn't be embarrassed to ignore this little request. In this year when everyone is looking for a job, you have to squeeze forward whenever there is an opportunity, there's no room for careful consideration. He thought about the solution and waited quietly for the time to come. At six o'clock that afternoon, the sky wasn't very dark yet. In the large dining room in front, the two gasoline lamps were still lit at the same time. The whooshing sound of the flames could be heard clearly in the back yard corridor. In this world without electric lights, looking at the bright light through the windows, one could imagine how extravagant the situation was over there. Gradually, the sound of men and women laughing came through the windows. Presumably, the people attending the banquet had already arrived. Zhang Jiefu, with his hands behind his back, paced back and forth in the corridor, looking at the yellowish kerosene lamp light in Cheng Zhiqian's room, which was still on. Presumably, he hadn't gone to the banquet yet. Of course, he had to wait for him to leave before he could talk about what he wanted. He paced back and forth several times, but Cheng Zhiqian was still reading under the kerosene lamp. Even though someone was pacing back and forth outside the window, he didn't even look up. Jiefu wanted to greet him, but then he thought that it was none of his business whether others attended the banquet or not, so why bother with that, so he gave up and went to take a look outside the back yard. Outside this yard was a large open yard, which was where long-distance cars parked for guests from afar. (127)</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>As soon as the Empress Dowager mentioned this matter, she immediately changed to a very indignant attitude, and her tone was not as gentle as before. "But how do we know! Her appearance is also very upright and beautiful!" Who would have thought that her personality was so clumsy! She treats us as enemies and has never had the slightest goodwill towards us!"</p>
<p>According to the situation of ordinary families, mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law are often the most difficult to reconcile opposing forces in the family, and the reasons are always very complicated and difficult to study. Just like the discord between Empress Dowager Cixi and Empress Jiashun, it has almost long been a public fact, but the reasons for the discord are varied and inconclusive. What I know is that Jiashun fundamentally looked down on Cixi. Why did she look down on her husband's mother? In fact, before entering the palace, she had already known the secret that Cixi had been in love with Ronglu when she was young, so she couldn't help but feel contempt. Especially after Emperor Xianfeng ascended to heaven, the Empress Dowager immediately promoted Ronglu's official position丨In fact, although the Empress Dowager promoted Ronglu, they still could not get close, and even the opportunity to shake hands could be said to be absolutely non-existent.丨Even more dissatisfied Jiashun in her heart; she believed that a woman who was the mother of the world should never have any feelings for another man other than her husband. Therefore, the Empress Dowager, in her mind, was seen as a person who was not worthy of respect! "Translator's note: This section of narration, novelty is certainly very novel, but the credible component is very low! Princess Rong's preface written for this newspaper has specifically corrected it. (237)</p>

<h3 id="e274">The New Year in the Old Capital <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Xia</p>
<p>Although the government authorities have repeatedly ordered the people to celebrate the Gregorian New Year, the Chinese people in this place prefer to celebrate the indigenous Lunar New Year, even if the "Lunar Calendar" is called the "Waste Calendar," it's useless. Most citizens are happy to make use of waste. This situation is especially noticeable during the New Year festivals. The Gregorian New Year holidays are only three days for institutions and schools, and have no real relationship with the actual life of the general public. But when the Lunar New Year arrives, the situation is very different, especially in this quaint Beijing, the atmosphere of the New Year festival is overflowing everywhere, whether it is on wide streets or narrow alleyways.</p>
<p>If you are full of "steamed buns" and have nothing serious to do, and you feel that the stove is making your throat dry at home, then a way to pass the time without spending money is to stroll around. If you stroll to Beijing's most lively places, such as Dong'an Market, Xidan Market, Qianmen Street, Dashilar, etc., then you can encounter crowds of people. The social composition of the crowds is also bizarre and complex. There are concubines with eyebrows painted like new moons, noble young ladies with lipstick smeared like fresh blood, retired officials wearing gold-rimmed glasses and leather hats, college students wearing blue cloth gowns, female students wearing men's trousers, old-fashioned ladies with pancake-like buns and feet bound into awl shapes, young masters wearing thick-soled shoes and red capes, simple merchants, coolies in short clothes,········· a variety of characters, it's truly a grand exhibition of people. Some are buying "New Year's goods," some are "joining in the fun." The chaotic shouts of vendors and the sounds of bargaining form an urban symphony. Shops are always piled high with goods, labeled with "big discounts" and "selling out at a loss," tempting their customers.</p>
<p>The so-called New Year's goods are nothing more than "mixed sweets" made of honey dates, peanuts, persimmon cakes, green plums, etc., paper lanterns, rabbit-god lanterns with long fur, stove-king palaces for sending off the stove king, long incense sticks, red candles, melon seeds, watermelon seeds, peanuts, candied fruits, persimmons, etc. These things don't cost much, and most families, big and small, buy them to cook soup, worship ancestors, offer to gods, and fool children, to get through the once-a-year New Year festival. Although the global recession and the turbulence of the North China political situation have made them suffer, the merchants and vendors are not willing to easily let go of the "peak season" of the New Year festival, and they still have to force themselves to cheer up and make arrangements. But those of us who are strolling around can see it very clearly with a cold eye. Although the people in the market are squeezed so tightly, the wealthy old men who are "carelessly" buying goods are ultimately a minority. Most people are just there to join in the fun with a happy mood.</p>
<p>"The scene of the New Year festival in the old capital is lively, but the hearts of most people celebrating the New Year are full of suffering." I thought silently in my heart as I left the market and walked into the dust-filled alley.</p>

<h3 id="e275">Artistic Generalization <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Jia</p>
<p>Regarding "Artistic Generalization," Qi Jun's article "Realistic and Romantic" also touched upon it slightly; however, in that piece, the author only discussed it in general terms and did not treat it as a central issue of realistic creative methods.</p>
<p>The so-called "generalization" is not only a special term in art; in science, "generalization" also plays a significant role. However, because the methods of expression are different, the results of their generalization also differ. Here, "generalization" is a key opportunity for realistic understanding. The author extracts the essential, typical aspects from many characters or events and presents them in a comprehensive manner. The so-called "emphasis on characteristics" refers to this.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the difference between science and art lies mainly in the different methods of expression, that is, the former relies on abstract concepts for realistic understanding, while the latter relies on concrete images. The method of science is to proceed from the abstract to the concrete, while the method of art is to proceed from the concrete to the abstract. However, this distinction is not absolute. The method of science proceeds from the abstract to the concrete, but science cannot exist without the concrete and the intuitive. The method of art starts from the concrete (intuition), but this does not mean that the abstract method of science cannot be applied at all in art. Science is constructed by abstracting and generalizing the diversity and individuality of reality, while art depicts the diversity and individuality in reality as they are. This is generally correct, but not absolutely so, because art also often generalizes reality. For example, when a writer describes characters, he does not describe them one by one, but rather discards the accidental, non-essential differences in many characters and extracts the typical, characteristic aspects (such as habits, interests, desires, beliefs, grammar, etc.) to synthesize into a typical character.</p>
<p>Then, what is the difference between artistic generalization and theoretical generalization? It is often thought that scientific (theoretical) generalization is abstract, while artistic generalization is concrete. This view is incorrect. Because whether it is scientific truth or artistic truth, it is only a manifestation of the objective truth existing in reality, and truth is always concrete. Therefore, the difference between artistic generalization and theoretical generalization does not lie in the abstractness or concreteness of the truth they express, nor in the content of the truth, but in the difference in the forms of expression. Scientific truth is concrete not because it exists in reality as it is, but because it conforms to the essence of reality. However, this alone does not make it an artistic truth. Artistic truth must reproduce the essence of reality in a direct form existing in reality. Artistic generalization also takes not losing the directness of reality as a prerequisite. In this regard, the so-called sensory imagery becomes an issue.</p>
<p>Art, like science, has the task of understanding real life. Therefore, in order to concentrate the power of understanding, it is necessary to cleanse all accidental and non-essential phenomena from reality and further excavate the essence of reality. Here, artistic generalization is the same as scientific generalization, its purpose is to excavate the essence of real life, that is, it is treated as a key opportunity and a method for realistic understanding. Therefore, the correctness or truthfulness of artistic generalization is not only determined by the nature of the writer's point of view, but also by the adequacy of the writer's expression and ability. It is not as simple as Qi Jun said, a matter of "the writer's creative imagination or fantasy." Even if artistic generalization sometimes becomes a brilliant "prophecy" that foresees the archetype of a future era, this is not determined by the writer's rich imagination or fantasy, as Qi Jun said, but by the depth of the writer's understanding of reality, because if a writer wants to understand the future development form of historical laws, he must first deeply understand the past and present development forms of historical laws; after all, the former is nothing more than a higher form of development of the latter.</p>
<p>Regarding the role of generalization in art, the Russian critic Belinsky once said the following incisive words:</p>
<p>"The landscape created by a talented artist on canvas is more beautiful than all the picturesque views in nature. Why? Because there is nothing accidental left in it, all parts are subordinate to the whole, everything tends to one purpose, everything forms a beautiful whole, and so do individual things.</p>
<p>Reality itself is beautiful. But its beauty lies in its essence, its elements, its content, not in its form. In this sense, reality is like pure gold in a lump of ore and earth that has not yet been cleansed. Science and art are like washing away this real gold nugget and giving it a beautiful form."</p>
<p>Therefore, great art is never a non-differentiated record of real phenomena, but should be reorganized and unified from a correct and progressive point of view for reproduction.</p>
<p>Artistic generalization is conditional. And this condition is determined by the object of generalization. When a writer applies the method of artistic generalization, he must pay attention to whether the difference between the two or more phenomena being generalized is essential or accidental. The so-called artistic generalization refers to the difference of the latter. Artistic generalization cannot transcend the era (such as referring to the generalization of era events), nor can it transcend the class (such as the typical generalization of characters). Writers can never generalize events from different eras, nor can they generalize real people from different classes and different lives.</p>
<p>The archetype of a character is concrete and presents different faces depending on the era. "In the 1880s (Russia), intellectuals were disappointed and dissatisfied with the destruction of the revolutionary movement on the one hand, and felt the pain of the slow development of capitalism on the other. In such a rapidly changing era, intellectuals wanted to find their place and happiness, so most of them fell into the dream of the 'small events' theory, only seeking to obtain their own personal happiness, managing the trivial matters of their own personal lives, or running under the banner of Tolstoy's theory, resisting the development of civilization, and only paying attention to the cultivation and completion of private morality." However, with the arrival of the 1890s, with the forward development of capitalism, and the change in the social status of the entire civilian intellectual class, those "unthinking, unemotional" intellectuals who felt that "the colorful clothes of life have faded, leaving only some dull mottled marks," and hoped to find some "happy illusions" in the grave in the 1880s, gradually reduced their misanthropic thoughts and decadence and emotions, and in their souls, burned the joy of life and the longing for a bright future. The typical characters in Chekhov's works in the 1890s are mostly those who "look ahead boldly with their heads held high." Nadezhda, who abandoned her hometown and ran to Moscow to study in "The Betrothed," is also presented as a representative of the new symbol. The emptiness of the past has disappeared in the lives of the new characters. What is burning in their hearts now is the bright future 丨 the longing for civilian freedom.</p>
<p>In a word: Artistic generalization is conditional; therefore, the image of the so-called typical character should also be era-based and class-based. In this sense, great works that excavate the essence of a specific stage of history should also be epoch-making labors.</p>

<h3 id="e277">Bodhi Temple <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— Xiangshan</p>
<p>Longing for the Bodhi Temple, where lonely flowers bloom.</p>
<p>Living outside the city, from the time the sun hangs on the beam of the temple well, I sneak into the cemetery behind the temple. In this aisle of lonely graves, with the heart of a monk or nun, I wander back and forth.</p>
<p>There are no monks in the temple, only an old man watching the temple, languidly holding a broom, leisurely sweeping the white plum blossoms pecked apart by chickens.</p>
<p>The loveliness of the Bodhi Temple lies in the cemetery behind the temple. The cemetery has a kind of unrhymed silence, which is a simple and sentimental poem; on the marble or granite tombstones are engraved the names of people who have passed away, which can make people recall the rise and fall of the so-called touching and tragic history. Moreover, the moss-covered mouths of the tombstones can make people feel the sorrow of the wilderness.</p>
<p>When alive, they are all strangers, but after closing their eyes, strangers gather in this small cemetery, equally covered with fallen plum blossoms, equally listening to the sound of the temple keeper striking the bell, without joy, let alone jealousy, all quietly comforted in the winter sunshine.</p>
<p>In front of the tombstones are placed stone basins, carved with stone, the clear water reflects the clouds of the sky, when the cold wind howls down from the withered branches, passing over the water surface, the ripples of small lines, fold the clouds. And the shadow of the grass flower inserted in the water basin, also trembling slightly, the water droplets condensed on the grass flower, like beads, fall into the basin, whether these water droplets are the tears of the mourner, who knows? These water droplets are crystal clear!</p>
<p>On the roof ridge of the main hall of the Bodhi Temple, there are countless sparrows, basking in the winter sun, the noisy sound, breaks the afternoon silence of the cemetery. If the sound of the shotgun rings out in the distance outside the temple, the sparrows will fly in the clear sky like black sesame seeds, and when the sound of flapping wings disappears, the cemetery will appear even more desolate and monotonous; making myself, wandering in the aisle, feel a terrifying stillness; mistaking the warm sun for the cool moon.</p>
<p>Last winter, when I was avoiding the cold in Ito Onsen Township on the Izu Peninsula, I stayed in a boarding house near a certain Bodhi Temple. Ito is a water town, the front window faces the clear blue sea, and the back window is the cemetery behind the Bodhi Temple. Behind the cemetery is the gradually steep, withered yellow winter mountain. At dusk, the fog-like night falls from the sea, and the steam from the hot springs in the back mountain gradually sinks to the foot of the mountain, crossing the cemetery and hanging on the back window; at this time, I indulge in meditation alone, sitting cross-legged, and I feel a kind of grey shadow in my heart, drilling in from the back window, feeling a kind of sharp and chilling pleasure.</p>
<p>The temple keeper in this temple is a suave old man. Whenever the night is late, there is often a kind of intense, desolate, and sad sound coming from the old man's room. This is the old man's only pleasure, the sound of the "shakuhachi"! The "shakuhachi" can often emit sounds of resentment, sorrow, and grief, like the Qiang flute outside the Great Wall, which can evoke homesickness, but sometimes I am often fascinated by this sound, and I can't help but shed tears. These tears are warm. Let me make a rash analogy! This mood of tears is like the mood of a guilty child repenting in the arms of a loving mother.</p>
<p>Often when I wake up in a dream, I hear the mournful sound of birds in the cemetery under the back window: when I can't stand it, I put on my clothes and open the "rain door" of the back window, and the ground is full of bright moon, clear and sharp like a white blade dancing in front of my eyes, the tombstones are dyed crystal white, only the dense shade of the main hall falls on the frost, black and white contrast, there is a kind of indescribable interest; and the plum trees in the foothills, like white mist, low on the ground, the fragrance of yellow and the faint smell of the sea, make me feel a special taste. And thus the longing for the Bodhi Temple is even deeper.</p>
<p>Whether it is a flower or a bell in the temple, it contains the magic power to make people feel emotional and meditate. Especially in the corner of the temple, or under the trees, the stone statue of Jizo, standing alone, can make people forget their pain. The Jizo statue is a smiling, slightly fat ascetic, his body is covered with the traces of wind and rain erosion, but the smile on his face still smiles at everyone; wearing a red alms hair and a cape, with traces of crow droppings on his body, but still smiling plainly, in the human world, I am afraid that only this stone statue of Jizo can find such a smiling face!</p>
<p>Looking at this Jizo, I can recall the classic dance recitation drama "Otsuya Kyoran," how Otsuya, an abandoned woman, goes crazy in front of the Jizo statue, and the Jizo still smiles without saying a word. Why can't the stone Jizo give Otsuya passion and comfort? Is this smile a sneer? It made me shudder.</p>
<p>Now I live in a remote alley far away from the Bodhi Temple. Every day, I am tired of the noise of the city and the sound of machines. When I sit silently by the window or in my dreams, I often feel that I am still wandering in the cemetery of the Bodhi Temple, looking at the tombstones, water basins, wells, and smiling Jizo, and especially silently reciting the fact that the stone slab once left my footprints, and that I have wandered back and forth hundreds of times in the aisle, and when I am in pain in my heart, it is a soothing and peaceful good medicine. I am longing for the Bodhi Temple. The Bodhi Temple still often blooms with lonely flowers, and in the early spring, it is still overflowing with an air that is more mellow than wine.</p>
<p>The Bodhi Temple is desolate, and the cemetery behind the temple is even more desolate, the lonely graves stand silently under the trees.</p>
<h3 id="e278">The Celebrated Jumping Frog (1) <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— Mark Twain, translated by Libo</p>
<p>Complying with a friend's request in a letter from the East, I went to visit Simon Wheeler, a gentle, loquacious old man, to inquire about my friend's friend, Leonidas W. Smiley—as my friend requested—the result of which visit I will write below. I have a nagging suspicion that Leonidas W. Smiley is an imaginary person; my friend has never known such a person; he is simply calculating that if I ask old Wheeler about him, it will remind him of that wicked Jim Smiley, and he will start to tell some long, foul stories that are useless to me and make me terribly annoyed. If that was the purpose, it was achieved.</p>
<p>In a dilapidated hotel in the decaying Angel's Camp mining district, I found Simon Wheeler, the old fellow dozing comfortably by the fireplace in the saloon. I noticed that he was fat, bald, and that his placid face bore a charming expression of kindness and simplicity. He jumped up and greeted me with a "Good day." I told him that I had a friend who asked me to inquire about a childhood intimate friend named Leonidas W. Smiley, the Reverend Leonidas W. Smiley, a young missionary, who he had heard had once been a resident of Angel's Camp. I added that I would be very grateful if Mr. Wheeler could tell me anything about the Reverend Smiley.</p>
<p>Simon Wheeler pushed me back into a corner and began the following monotonous story with his chair. He never smiled, he never frowned, he never changed the rounded key from which he had plucked the first word, he never betrayed a single suspicion of emotion; but throughout the entire endless story there ran a poignant ardor and a sincere pulse, plainly showing me that he had not the slightest idea that there was anything strange or ridiculous about his story, that he regarded it as a real and important matter, and that he admired the two protagonists in it as remarkable geniuses in chicanery. I let him go on at his own convenience, never interrupting him once.</p>
<p>"The Reverend Leonidas—why, the Reverend—well, there used to be a fellow here named Jim Smiley, in the winter of '49, or maybe it was the spring of '50—I don't remember exactly, anyway it was one or the other of them two times, because I do recall him coming to the Camp when the creeks hadn't dried up yet—but he was a most curious man, always wanting to bet on anything he saw, the opposite way from other folks, mind you; and if he couldn't find anybody to bet against him, he'd change sides. Anyway that suited him, I reckon—anyway, so long as he could get a bet, he was satisfied. But he was lucky, uncommon lucky; he always come out winner. He was always ready to bet on any opportunities; there warn't any get-at-able thing that he warn't ready to bet on, and I told you he'd as lief bet on one side as t'other. If there was a horse-race, you'd find him either flush or busted at the end of it; if there was a dog-fight, he'd bet on it; if there was a cat-fight, he'd bet on it; if there was a chicken-fight, he'd bet on it; why, if there was two birds settin' on a fence, he would bet you which one would fly first; or if there was a camp-meetin', he would be there regular to bet on Parson Walker, which he judged to be the best exhorter about here, and so a good man. If he see a straddle-bug start to go anywheres, he would bet you how long it would take him to get wherever he was going to, and if you took him up, he would foller that straddle-bug clear to whatever place he was bound for, or clear to Mexico. Lots of the boys here has seen that Smiley, and can tell you about him. However that don't signify—it was just a natural gift. Pahrson Walker's wife laid very sick once, for a good long time, and it seemed as if they warn't going to save her; but one morning he come in, and Smiley asked how she was, and he said she was considerable better—thank the Lord for his infinite mercy—and coming on so smart that, with the blessing of Providence, she'd get well yet; and Smiley, before he thought, says, "Well, I'll risk two-and-a-half that she don't."</p>

<h3 id="e281">Sino-Italian Communication Report <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>In the past year, the International Radio Station established by the Ministry of Communications has opened direct lines to the United Kingdom and Japan in addition to the original circuits. There has been obvious progress in business, and telecommunications revenue has also increased.</p>
<p>Recently, the Sino-Italian Communication Report was also established. News transmission between Shanghai and Rome can be achieved in an instant through the station. The International Radio Station has been planning a wireless network for communication with the world for years. After a lot of effort, as of now, all important cities in the world have direct circuits that can be connected. Although it cannot be said to be exhaustive, its achievements are also very gratifying to us.</p>
<p>It is found that the sound of Sino-Italian communication has been very loud last year. The preparation period was relatively long. The initial test results were not bad. The perceived shortcomings were that the electrical power of the Rome radio station was slightly weaker, which had an impact on reception. Before opening, we had to be extra cautious, so we technically improved it again and re-tested it. After both parties considered it satisfactory, it was officially opened for business on the 21st of last month. The situation is actually like this.</p>
<p>The initial launch of Sino-Italian communication was not at the request of our country, but at the request of the Italian government. It is slightly different from the situation of communication with other places. The relationship between Italy and our country is closer, and business has developed a lot in recent years. In addition, it is noted that our country's international radio stations have a good reputation for handling overseas communications. Therefore, the Italian side is very eager for Sino-Italian communication, and after consideration by our side, it also expressed sympathy, so it was decided to follow. Now that it has been implemented, the satisfaction of both China and Italy is self-evident.</p>
<p>European countries, such as England, France, Germany, and Russia, have all communicated directly with our country's radio stations one after another. Rome is the political center of Southern Europe, and Shanghai is an important commercial port in our country. There are quite a few expatriates in each other's countries. International trade depends entirely on the intelligence of telecommunications, and in terms of political affairs, Italy has promoted us in precedence, which shows that Sino-Italian relations are becoming more progressive. For the sake of friendship between the two countries and for the sake of our country's international wireless telecommunications business, the Sino-Italian communication report is undeniably important. This is brought up in the hope that our countrymen will pay close attention to it.</p>
<h3 id="e282">On Telephone Arrears <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>In the fourteenth issue of this publication, the author once wrote an article "On Government Telegram Arrears," outlining the general amount of government telegram arrears and the reasons for the arrears. The conclusion was that the economic difficulties of the telecommunications administration were due to the accumulation of government telegram arrears, and the solution lay in strict enforcement. In recent years, the Ministry of Communications has strictly investigated and seized private matters sent through government telegrams, and has also made every effort to collect cash at half price for government telegrams. Except for military telegrams for bandit suppression, which only require the cost of materials, no other telegrams can be sent on credit. This has been repeatedly ordered and followed by the National Government, and government and military agencies have also shown considerable understanding, and people in society have even more sympathy. Therefore, it is not difficult to start the reorganization. However, telephone arrears have not yet been noticed, and the amount owed is huge, reaching 2,500,934 yuan and 89 cents as of June of the 23rd year of the Republic [1934]. Such a figure is quite alarming! The total amount of monthly rental fees owed by users of each telephone bureau is as follows:</p>

<p>Looking at the table above, it can be seen that the problem of telephone arrears is as serious as the problem of government telegram arrears. The reasons for telephone arrears, in addition to a few unscrupulous supervisors engaging in corruption and malpractice (this trend has been curbed since the Ministry of Communications strengthened rectification), also include the following points: A. Due to changes in the current situation, the indebted organizations and groups no longer exist; B. Various organizations and groups have not paid monthly rental fees due to changes in supervisors; C. Due to military influence, users have moved in a hurry and cannot be collected from; D. Businesses have closed down, resulting in no collection prospects; E. Although government agencies or businesses exist, they arbitrarily delay payment on the grounds of financial difficulties or business downturn. It is found that items A, C, and D are caused by sudden changes and user mobility, making it impossible to collect. However, these are accidental events of a temporary nature, not a permanent situation, and involve a small number of users, not a widespread phenomenon. Telephone bureau supervisors should pay close attention in advance to prevent them and take appropriate measures afterward to remedy them, and should not shirk responsibility due to changes in the situation. Items B and E do not have sufficient reasons! There have always been changes in supervisors of old agencies, and joint responsibility is clearly stipulated in the law. As for financial difficulties or business downturn, even if they are true, they are internal matters of the agency or business and have nothing to do with telephone fees. Before the agency is cancelled or the business closes down, the telephone bureau should strictly urge collection to value public funds, and users must not use one-sided reasons or other pretexts to evade and rely on them, disregarding the state-owned enterprise. Furthermore, the materials for telephone equipment are mostly purchased from overseas and are of great value. The price of a telephone set installed by a user is about 60 to 70 yuan for an automatic type and about 30 to 40 yuan for a common battery type. Therefore, a deposit and installation fee should be paid according to regulations at the time of installation. Many agencies pay this deposit as required, but there are also many who delay payment. Even due to the current situation, the personnel of the agency are scattered, and the telephone set also disappears. When another agency arises to replace it and needs telephone equipment urgently, the telephone bureau has no telephone sets in storage and no deposit to offset, so it is bound to submit a request to the Ministry of Communications to purchase new sets. The exchange of official documents delays the time, and users who need telephones see that they have not been installed for a long time, feel greatly inconvenienced, and even scold the telephone bureau for its ineffective handling. They do not deeply understand the telephone bureau's predicament due to accumulated arrears and the inability to do anything.</p>
<p>Since telephone equipment is more expensive than telegrams, and paying a deposit is more reliable than telegram fees, the monthly rental fee is usually only a few yuan to more than ten yuan, which is not as large as the telegram fee, which can be more than ten yuan or hundreds of yuan for one telegram. Moreover, local calls are only a few miles or tens of miles away, and the call time never includes the phrases "urgent" or "immediate arrival." This is the difference in the nature of telephone and telegraph services, and the difference in the ease of handling. Therefore, users must understand the difficulties of the telephone business and pay the monthly rental fee of only ten or so yuan or a few yuan on time. Otherwise, it is better to have the telephone removed to avoid dragging down the business. On the telephone bureau's side, it should strictly urge collection in accordance with the regulations of the ministry. On the other hand, it must approach users in various ways, verbally or in writing, to fully disclose the bureau's difficulties and explain the relationship between state-owned enterprises and the country and its people, to gain their understanding and then achieve the effect of concerted efforts.</p>
<p>It is heard that the Ministry of Communications has stipulated two measures for telephone arrears and ordered the bureaus to comply: (1) For old arrears that have collection prospects, collection should be stepped up. For those that have no collection prospects, a list of the user's name, amount of arrears, and whether there is a deposit should be submitted to the ministry for approval. (2) In the future, fees should be strictly collected according to regulations, and those who have not paid the deposit should immediately pay it, and there should be no more delays. After this reorganization, telephone arrears should come to an end, and the telephone bureau's revenue may improve?</p>
<h3 id="e283">Congratulations on the Success of Direct Communication Between China and Italy <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— Zhongming</p>
<p>I have learned that there have long been discussions about direct communication between China and Italy. However, because the Rome Radio Station in the Italian capital and the Shanghai International Radio Station initially felt that the radio waves emitted by the Italian station were too weak and the wavelength was insufficient after testing communication, and the radio signals received by our side were not very clear, the Roman telecommunications authorities worked hard to improve, increase power, expand equipment, and conduct further tests. The results were excellent, the audio signals were exceptionally clear, and the speed was extremely fast. Therefore, formal communication began on the 21st of last month [October 21, 1934], and the business has been very prosperous. Therefore, I write what I feel to celebrate the success.</p>
<p>The introduction of Western culture to our country began with the arrival of the Italian Matteo Ricci in China during the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty for missionary work. Subsequently, Italians Ferdinand Verbiest and Johann Adam Schall von Bell continued to come east during the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, introducing sciences such as astronomy and mathematics, and at the same time introducing Eastern culture to the West. Therefore, the two great ancient countries of China and Italy hold the authority to communicate between East and West. Since the mutual elevation of ambassadors last year, the diplomatic relations have become even more cordial. Given the close relationship between the two countries, it is inevitable to feel that the lack of direct communication facilities is a flaw. Now that there is a direct telecommunications circuit between the two countries, it is expected that the diplomatic relations between the two countries will become even closer as a result. This is one reason. In the past, telecommunications between China and Italy, whether wireless or submarine cable, had to be relayed, which was too uneconomical in terms of time. From now on, telegrams between Shanghai and Rome can be sent directly, and telegrams from other places belonging to the two countries can be relayed by the two places, which is also faster than the previous relay. This is of great benefit to the business of the two countries. This is the second reason. It is estimated that the annual telegram fees spent between China and Italy amount to hundreds of thousands. In the past, due to the lack of direct circuits, these telegram fees inevitably leaked out and were at the mercy of others. With the existence of direct circuits, telegrams between the two countries can be handled by themselves, rather than relying on others. Since the leak has been plugged, the country will become richer. In view of the development of national and national thought among the people of the two countries in recent years, there is no reason to harm one's own interests for the benefit of others and damage one's own rights. This is very relevant to the future of telecommunications in both countries. This is the third reason. With these three reasons, it cannot be said that the telegraph services between China and Italy will not develop! This is my wish!</p>
<h3 id="e284">How to Use Telegrams? (Continued) <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Zhonghua</p>
<p>Regarding the "follow-up telegram" mentioned above, the sender often wants to know when it can be delivered properly. In that case, the telegraph bureau also has a convenient way. That is: the sender can ask the telegraph bureau to notify him immediately by telegram or mail after the delivery is completed. If a telegram is used, the sender only needs to add a "PC" to the recipient's name and address in the original telegram as a fee-paying mark, and only needs to prepay the ordinary telegram fee for six words. If a letter is used, the sender only needs to prepay the postage for a registered letter and add a "PCP" as a fee-paying mark. Sometimes, the sender is very anxious because he does not receive a reply from the recipient, so he can also use this delivery notification to prove that the recipient has indeed received it, which is very beneficial.</p>
<p>Regarding the content of the telegram, the telegraph bureau has always kept it absolutely confidential. Therefore, when the telegraph bureau sends a telegram to the recipient's name and address, the recipient must sign and stamp it to avoid being read by servants or other related people, which would lead to the disclosure of the telegram. In order to respect the interests of the recipient, the telegraph bureau has also formulated a "personal delivery telegram" method to remedy the above-mentioned shortcomings. The procedure for sending this "personal delivery telegram" is very simple. Just add a "MP" as a fee-paying mark. When the telegraph bureau at the receiving end sees a telegram with the "MP" mark, it will write "personal delivery" on the envelope and tell the messenger to deliver it to the recipient in person. In this way, the confidentiality of the telegram will be further guaranteed.</p>
<p>Some people think that "personal delivery telegrams" are still not very appropriate, because the recipient cannot stay in the office or residence all day long, so the "personal delivery telegram" can easily be delayed for a long time before it is received. Moreover, unless there has been contact beforehand, the telegraph bureau messenger cannot accurately prove the authenticity of the recipient. These practical difficulties are indeed unavoidable. Therefore, the telegraph bureau has also formulated another "hold for delivery" method, that is, the recipient goes to the telegraph bureau to pick it up himself, without going through the messenger's delivery procedure. In that case, the sender and receiver can absolutely maintain confidentiality and no longer have any worries. This "hold for delivery telegram" also has a convenience. For example, if the sender knows that the recipient has not yet arrived or has already left, he can allow the telegram to be temporarily held at the receiving bureau, waiting for the person or their representative to come to the bureau to pick it up in person, to avoid non-delivery. If the place where the telegram is to be received only has a post office and no telegraph bureau, then it can be handed over to the local post office for holding. The telegram held for delivery by the post office uses "GP" as a fee-paying mark. The telegram held for delivery by the telegraph bureau uses "TR" as a fee-paying mark. If it needs to be sent by registered mail by the post office, a separate registered postage fee must be added, and at the same time, "GPR" is used as a fee-paying mark.</p>
<p>The confidentiality of communication is certainly very important, but in some cases, it is not necessary to keep it confidential, or because of the need to keep it confidential, various inconveniences may arise. For example: A and B work in the same agency. A, as usual, returns home by car on Saturday night. Because of a temporary accident, he sends a telegram to B, asking him to ask for leave for a few days. It just so happens that B also asks for leave that day, so the telegram is placed on B's desk and no one cares about it. The colleagues in the agency, because they respect the confidentiality of communication between the two, of course do not want to open it. Therefore, A's leave procedures are not handled by anyone on his behalf, and he is eventually reprimanded by his superiors. Under these circumstances, the telegraph bureau also has a "sealed telegram" method to make up for the above-mentioned shortcomings. The so-called "sealed" means that the telegram envelope is not sealed and can be opened by anyone, so that anyone who sees it can immediately follow the meaning of the telegram and handle it, without having to wait for the recipient to handle it in person. This kind of sealed telegram uses "Ouvert" as a fee-paying mark.</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter wants to introduce a "cheap and good" special telegram. This kind of telegram is not directly sent by the sender, but it directly reduces the burden on the sender, and all readers can enjoy this special right. This is the "postal money order telegram"! In order to reduce the telegraph fees for people who use telegrams to remit money, the Ministry of Communications specially formulated a cheap money order telegram. No matter how much money you remit, as long as you go to the postal money order bureau to remit money, you only need to pay the appropriate exchange fee and a telegraph fee of six dimes. Among domestic telegrams, except for diplomatic telegrams, there is no telegram cheaper than six dimes. This preferential method is not enjoyed by people who go to banks to remit money. Readers, you might as well try it. (Ann)</p>

<p>— Jian</p>
<p>1. Michael Faraday</p>
<p>Faraday was born in 1791 AD. He was an English scientist who made many inventions in chemistry, electricity, and magnetism, and was known for his time. In 1821, he first advocated that the rotation of a magnetic needle around an electric current was based on the theory of electromagnetism invented by Oersted in 1820. In 1831, he invented electromagnetic induction, and then created the basic principle of generator structure; in 1838, he invented the dielectric constant; in 1847, he invented the magnetic pole of light; the following year, he invented diamagnetism. He was a famous experimenter, and his contribution to modern electricity was particularly great.</p>
<p>2. Joseph Henry</p>
<p>Henry was born in 1797 AD and was an American physicist famous for his research on electromagnetism. After Sturgeon of England invented the electromagnet, Henry studied it in depth and made it a tool for extremely large electricity. In 1831, Henry used a thin copper wire about one mile long and an electromagnet to make the current attract the armature and strike a bell, thus forming the principle of modern telegraph application. In 1832, Henry was hired as a professor by Polingston University. In the school's laboratory, he used the principle of telegraph relay to configure the position of storage batteries and electromagnets, so that long-distance telegrams could be transmitted. He was the first to measure magnetic self-induction. In 1842, he specialized in oscillating discharge and studied other electrical phenomena. In 1846, he was elected as the secretary of the Washington Smithsonian Society. When he was working in the US Lighthouse Department, he also made important experiments such as maritime signals. Henry also conducted in-depth research on meteorology, geomagnetism, and acoustics. Henry has won international honors and is known as one of the most famous scientists in the United States.</p>
<p>3. William Thomson, Lord Kelvin</p>
<p>Kelvin was born in Belfast, England in 1824 AD. He entered Glasgow University at the age of ten. He graduated from Cambridge University in 1845. At the age of only twenty-two, he was hired as a professor of natural philosophy at Glasgow University and maintained his chair for fifty years with his outstanding talent. Around the age of forty, he was revered as a master of mathematics and science in England. His reputation was further enhanced by his important inventions in electrical telegraphs, compasses, and nautical instruments. He was awarded a knighthood in 1866 and a baronetcy in 1892. He died in 1907.</p>
<p>4. James Clerk Maxwell</p>
<p>Maxwell was born in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1831. He studied at Edinburgh and Cambridge Universities. From 1856 to 1869, he served as a professor of natural philosophy at Aberdeen University. From 1860 to 1865, he served as a professor of physics and astronomy at Kings College in London. In 1871, Maxwell was the first professor of experimental physics at the newly established Cambridge University. In his later years, Maxwell wielded the greatest authority in physics. His fame became more prominent after his death. Maxwell made many contributions to wireless telegraphy, especially electricity, which was his main research science throughout his life. In 1867, his first important paper, On Electromagnetic Theory, was praised by the Royal Society. In 1873, his immortal work, Electricity and Magnetism, was published. In the book, he explained the Electromagnetic Theory of Light and his Theory on Electric Waves, which was later verified by Hertz's experiments and created modern wireless telegraphy and telephones.</p>
<h3 id="e286">A Review of the Private Settlement of the Case of the Private Radio Station Set Up by Yongzengho Bank in Tianjin <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— Diyou</p>
<p>The trial of the criminal part of the case of the private radio station set up by Yongzengho and Yongli Banks in Tianjin has been repeatedly recorded in this publication. As for the private compensation part, except for a part of Yongli Bank that has not yet been resolved, it is heard that Yongzengho has realized its mistake, sought mediation, and has reached a settlement. The situation is briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>After the criminal part of the case was sentenced by the Tianjin Court, the Tianjin Telegraph Bureau immediately began the private compensation procedures, requesting the court to provisionally seize the existing business income and all movable property of Yongzengho and Yongli Banks in accordance with Articles 488 and 489 of the Civil Procedure Law; and separately drafted a complaint to formally file a private lawsuit. While the above-mentioned provisional seizure was being ruled by the court, Yongzengho Bank immediately requested the Tianjin Bankers' Association to send a letter to the Telegraph Bureau, elaborating on the bank's remorse and willingness to compensate for the losses; at the same time, it entrusted Lawyer Kuai Jinde to send a letter to Lawyer Zhou Ze, the attorney of the Tianjin Bureau, to forward it to the Tianjin Bureau, briefly saying: "Yongzengho Bank has now designated the two million yuan of fixed deposits in Tianjin Bank of Communications under Liu Chaoqing's account on October 11 as security deposit in order to request the revocation of the provisional seizure. No withdrawals will be made before the compensation lawsuit is determined or the settlement is reached. If approved, please declare by your bureau to the court that the provisional seizure of that part will be temporarily suspended, and only the provisional seizure of Yongli Bank will be executed on a fixed-term basis to comply with the procedures. How should this be handled, please review and handle," etc. The Tianjin Bureau, according to the letter, considered that the two million yuan of fixed deposits in Tianjin Bank of Communications designated by the bank as a security deposit were not much different from the amount of 21,000 yuan requested by the bank for compensation. This method is not inconsistent with the law, and the bank also entrusted the Bankers' Association to come forward to request a settlement. The situation was sincere. In order to settle the matter and preserve the bank's business reputation, the bureau readily accepted the request and submitted a report to the Ministry of Communications for approval to pay the security deposit and revoke the provisional seizure of the bank's assets. At the same time, settlement procedures were carried out. As a result, the bank agreed to pay 17,000 yuan as compensation for the Tianjin Bureau's business losses, and the lawsuit was withdrawn, and the settlement was reached.</p>
<p>The Tianjin Bureau's telecommunications are extremely complete, and the transmission and reception of telegrams are fast and accurate, and has always been praised by Chinese and foreign people. However, the business house sent telegrams without using this legitimate and perfect institution, knowing that it was greedy for petty profits and did not hesitate to violate the law by setting up a private radio station. After the case was solved, the members of the number were either absconded for fear of crime, or were imprisoned. The body and spirit have suffered pain, and the business reputation has also been affected, and the private telegrams sent at ordinary times must still be paid for compensation. The magnitude of the loss was not what the bank initially expected. After this punishment, they deeply regretted their previous mistakes. Could those who set up private radio stations also know what to avoid?</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is heard that since the Ministry of Communications solved this case, the crackdown on private radio stations has become more serious. It has reiterated a clear order to telegraph institutions in various places to conduct strict investigations at any time, and the major telegraph bureaus in the major ports have published advertisements and offered rewards to encourage secret reports (the names of informants are kept absolutely confidential). It is found that private radio stations, on a small scale, disrupt finance and damage the market, and on a large scale, spread rumors and affect public security, or even provide resources for the enemy, endangering the country. The harm is too great to describe. It is hoped that people in society will share this understanding and help together. For everything heard and seen that involves the illegal establishment of radio stations, please report it at any time in a confidential letter to the local Ministry of Communications Telegraph Bureau or Radio Station, or directly report it to the Telegraph Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications in Nanjing, so as to conduct investigations and confiscate them and strictly enforce national laws. It is thought that this is also what those who are enthusiastically patriotic are happy to do.</p>
<h3 id="e287">Discussing Two Types of Telegrams Serving Society <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— Qinghua</p>
<p>Telegrams are divided into several types, such as government affairs, urgent, ordinary, news, social, and official business. Except for official business telegrams, which are sent internally by the telegraph office for official purposes and are not charged, all other types of telegrams are charged uniformly, but the prices vary. In addition, there are two other types of telegrams that are transmitted free of charge by the telegraph office: meteorological telegrams and disaster relief telegrams. The former is of great importance to navigation safety, and the latter is related to disaster relief in disaster areas. The telegraph office is specially authorized to transmit them free of charge, with the intention of serving society!</p>
<p>However, due to the free nature of the above two types of telegrams, redundancy is inevitable, which not only consumes more materials for the telegraph office, but also clogs the circuits, affecting the transmission speed of other types of telegrams. Therefore, from the perspective of the telegraph office, if redundancy is found, strict restrictions are the only option.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about meteorological telegrams.</p>
<p>Meteorological telegrams are telegrams in which meteorological agencies report meteorological observations or meteorological forecasts. International telegrams are charged at half the price of ordinary telegrams in accordance with Article 73 of the International Telegraph Regulations. For domestic telegrams, the Ministry of Communications, in view of the small number of meteorological agencies in China and their mostly inadequate finances, has specially authorized free transmission. However, in recent years, the number of meteorological agencies has gradually increased. In addition to the existing observatories in Shanghai and Qingdao, there are now the Central Meteorological Research Institute, the Aviation Committee, meteorological stations run by the Shandong and Jiangsu Construction Bureaus, and the Shanxi Agricultural College. In order to carry out meteorological forecasting, the above-mentioned meteorological agencies need to collect reports of meteorological observations from various places. Therefore, the number of agencies sending meteorological telegrams is extremely large, such as customs houses, aviation stations, and county governments, totaling more than 200. Each agency sends meteorological telegrams twice a day, totaling more than 400 times. Some agencies even send telegrams to two meteorological agencies at the same time, making the number of telegrams even more numerous. As a result, the telegraph office, due to the free nature of meteorological telegrams, inevitably transmits fee-based telegrams first, and then meteorological telegrams, so a small number of meteorological telegrams are inevitably delayed, and meteorological agencies express dissatisfaction as a result. The Ministry of Communications has recently taken this into account, believing that meteorological telegrams are related to navigation safety. Since free transmission is allowed, they should be transmitted quickly so that they can be effective in a timely manner. Otherwise, when they reach the meteorological agencies, they are already outdated, useless to the meteorological agencies, and waste labor and materials for the telegraph office, which is very uneconomical. However, there should be a systematic organization of national meteorological agencies to avoid each acting on its own. For example, the meteorological stations run by the Jiangsu and Shandong Construction Bureaus are not connected with the Central Meteorological Research Institute, so most of the meteorological telegrams sent from various places are redundant, which is inevitable for redundancy. It is now heard that the Ministry of Communications is discussing with the Central Meteorological Research Institute and the Aviation Committee on the organization of a meteorological communication network, so that meteorological telegrams can achieve the greatest effect at the smallest cost, so that both parties feel convenient. Before this communication network is formed, the Ministry of Communications has first ordered various telegraph offices to quickly transmit meteorological telegrams, and has stipulated abbreviations for various receiving meteorological agencies, such as OBSER for ordinary meteorological agencies and OBSAV for aviation meteorological agencies, so that the number of telegram words is reduced and transmission can be faster. At the same time, it also ordered the Nanjing Telegraph Office to contact the Central Meteorological Research Institute, which receives the most telegrams, to install a dedicated telephone line, so that when the telegraph office receives meteorological telegrams from various places, it can use the telephone to transmit them, which is faster than sending them by messengers. This is the greatest effort of the telegraph office to serve, and it is hoped that the Central Research Institute will come forward to seek a systematic organization of meteorological agencies in China, and strive to reduce unnecessary meteorological telegrams (referring to avoiding duplication, etc.), which will undoubtedly be of great benefit to meteorological observations!</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about disaster relief telegrams.</p>
<p>Disaster relief telegrams were originally set up for temporary emergency relief. Anyone sending disaster relief telegrams must first apply to the Ministry of Communications for a free disaster relief telegram permit, with a maximum period of six months. Each telegram must not exceed 100 words. The restrictions were originally very strict, but in recent years, natural and man-made disasters have come one after another in China, so that charitable organizations and disaster relief agencies have never ended their disaster relief efforts, and the disaster relief telegram permits have been extended again and again. Recently, more disaster relief agencies have emerged, so that disaster relief telegrams are becoming increasingly numerous. According to regulations, disaster relief telegrams should be limited to emergency relief. If they are ordinary and not urgent relief matters, they can be contacted by proxy telegrams. But in fact, now various disaster relief agencies send telegrams at every turn, with lengthy sentences. The telegraph office not only consumes materials, but also greatly affects other fee-based telegrams, which violates the original intention of free preferential treatment! It has been found that there is no provision for disaster relief telegrams in the domestic telegram regulations of various countries. It was initially thought that disasters and famines were rare in European, American, and Japanese countries, so there were no provisions for disaster relief telegrams. However, in fact, the great earthquake in Tokyo, Japan in 1923 caused great harm. At that time, the telegrams sent by Japanese charitable organizations for emergency relief were all paid for at the price of ordinary telegrams, and there was no request for free treatment. Floods and droughts occur every year in European and American countries, and there is no method of sending telegrams free of charge. Furthermore, domestic railway bureaus charge full fares for disaster relief personnel to ride trains and charge half price for transporting disaster relief clothing and grain. The post office also charges fees for disaster relief correspondence in accordance with regulations. It can be seen that the free disaster relief telegram is actually a unique example at home and abroad. It is hoped that various disaster relief agencies will make good use of it and automatically reduce the number of telegrams and the number of words, so that the free preferential treatment will not be changed due to redundancy.</p>

<p>The Guangdong Provincial Telegraph Bureau Stops Charging Line Repair Fees</p>
<p>The telegraph bureaus in Guangdong Province previously believed that the telegraph lines in Guangdong Province were severely damaged and urgently needed to be repaired in order to maintain communication. However, the telegraph funds were insufficient, and it was not easy to raise funds for line repairs. Therefore, it was specially stipulated that domestic telegrams would be charged an additional 30% of the line repair fee per word (i.e., ordinary telegrams would be charged 1.3 yuan per word) to be used for line repair fees. The Ministry of Communications believed that although the additional line repair fee was prepared for proper line repairs, it increased the burden on the public and was different from the telegram prices in other provinces, which was unfair. Therefore, it has ordered the telegraph bureaus in Guangdong Province to stop charging the additional fee from January 1 to ensure uniformity.</p>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3 id="e289">Six Days of Winter Vacation <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— Long</p>
<p>During the six days of this newspaper's suspension for the winter vacation, there were certainly many changes in the world, at home, and even in this city that could serve as material for discussion. Here are a few of the more valuable events, briefly discussed.</p>
<p>First, the market in this city has been on a downward spiral in recent years, especially during the Lunar New Year, which is the most tense. Before the Lunar New Year, it was expected that the Lunar New Year last year would bring about an unprecedented economic downturn. However, last year's Lunar New Year, except for a few banks experiencing small-scale turmoil, was gradually calmed down due to sufficient reserves. It was still able to be celebrated peacefully amidst the sounds of drums and congratulations. In addition, after the holiday, many stores will inevitably fail to open their doors, but that is a matter for later, so let's not talk about it now.</p>
<p>Second, the issue of Japan's invasion of Chahar initially seemed very tense. Later, thanks to the efforts of diplomats, a large-scale conference was held, and the situation in eastern Chahar eased. As for the results of the discussion and the extent of the loss of our country's rights, we can ignore them for now. However, it is heard that the Japanese army can withdraw completely after the meeting. If so, the Chahar incident can be considered to have come to an end, and the incident will not expand further, which can be considered getting by.</p>
<p>Third, the issue of the European situation. On February 3 (i.e., Lunar New Year's Eve), the United Kingdom and Japan established the London Agreement. This matter is of utmost importance to the issue of European peace. Because among the European powers, the strongest are the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Germany, and Germany is in a position of antagonism with the other three countries. Moreover, its ambitions are high and its actions are perverse, causing everyone to look askance. However, the United Kingdom, France, and Italy cannot fully agree on how to deal with Germany due to their different positions and conflicting interests. Now, thanks to the efforts of French Foreign Minister Laval, the Rome Agreement was established with Italy, and the London Agreement was established with the United Kingdom. Thus, the three countries jointly cooperate to contain the powerful enemy, so the chances of success can be grasped. Therefore, the Italian Foreign Minister said, "1935 can be said to be an important year for peace building." That is the meaning of this.</p>
<h3 id="e290">Vagrants <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Ying</p>
<p>Like summer, the sky is so clear, sparkling with bright stars. But it's cold, the roadside trees have shed their leaves, the earth is exposed in its bareness. The Bohai Sea wind is also cold, flowing in along the Bai River, stinging the pores like knives. Vagrants, without proper leisure, lie on the short cement wall, blowing a tuneless tune, sinking their hearts into the dark depths, quietly counting the stars in the clear sky.</p>
<p>The cold driving force dispelled the vagrants' optimism. Groups of them, scattered here and there, or scattered sporadically, slowly gathered in the city center from the parks, from the streets, from the empty teahouses, from the ice-cellar-like hostels. The hustle and bustle of the city can shake the hearts of the hungry and cold, and the neon lights that twist like dragons can trigger a trace of warmth in human cells.</p>
<p>The cold wind caresses everything on the earth, treating the skyscrapers and the smallest grain of soil equally. The cold wind detracts from the color of the city center, the cold wind makes pedestrians hesitate, the cold wind makes people in heavy fur coats feel stiff even sitting in cars. The cold wind sweeps more than half of the street pedestrians to the night market.</p>
<p>At night, the vagrants have to enjoy a moment of warmth in the night market.</p>
<p>From the time the electric lights are turned on, the night market is populated. The peddlers also light their dim yellow oil lamps, giving their wares a faint shadow. It is unorganized, yet seems organized, with each stall on the street having a fixed location. After dinner time, the police carry large white cloth bags to collect stall donations, which start at a large copper coin.</p>
<p>The crowd gathers here, and here there is heat, there is strength, there is vitality. The small restaurants especially bang their frying pans loudly, and the flames from the stove make the faces of passersby turn red; the hoarse voices of the used clothing stalls are louder than each other, like several violins playing music without rosin; sellers and buyers are talking in raised voices, and when the buyer takes a few steps, the seller calls him back in an even louder voice, but the buyer refuses to turn around, and the two renegotiate the price at a distance of one hundred meters.</p>
<p>There are many people in the noisy crowd, but not many people come to buy things. The vagrant groups are deliberately warming themselves, and sometimes, perhaps if the opportunity is good, they can incidentally earn a little money. If it is goods, they are passed hand-to-hand to the pawnshop to exchange for money. Friends on the streets are righteous, everyone eats and drinks when they have money, and then they disperse in a rush.</p>
<p>In the night market, the stench is mixed with fragrance. In addition to groceries, there are also many late-night snacks. On the cold meat stalls, the halal stalls display whole pig heads with kind and benevolent eyes, while the Muslim stalls display large pieces of animal meat, which are black like a pile of buffalo dung; the congee vendors are surrounded by a thin mist, and people come and go in the hazy atmosphere. In addition, there are stalls selling sheep intestines, wontons, and sesame cakes, each with its own smell and posture.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it is precisely the brothers who are eating happily at these stalls. The black-clad police, together with the gray-clad informants, walk into the misty atmosphere and pat a vagrant on the shoulder, saying;</p>
<p>"Brother, your case is over!"</p>
<p>This brother then naturally drinks the last cup of wine, and without saying a word, lets others tie the white rope tightly on his arm, knowingly glancing around with his expressive eyes to inform the other vagrant groups. Why? The rules of the streets.</p>
<p>If, unfortunately, a hand is in someone else's pocket, he will be grabbed by the arm, which is the most disgraceful thing. At this time, this person must escape desperately. If the wind is favorable and someone is covering him, the vagrant groups will obstruct traffic, and people will be squeezed everywhere. When cars, horses, and people are all noisy, the pickpocket's catcher can only sigh in vain.</p>
<p>The vagrant groups watch the moon in the night year after year. If you ask how many shooting stars there are this year, they will be the first to know. It's just that the place is different. This year it's on the Bohai Sea coast, but last year it was on the ancient city walls. Next year, maybe it will be at the mouth of the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Whether it is on the Bohai Sea coast, whether it is on the ancient city walls, whether it is at the mouth of the Yangtze River, as long as there is a night market, this scene will always appear.</p>

<p>— Ye Jian</p>
<p>"A child born of wandering will never understand any yearning!"</p>
<p>Leaving my sick mother, leaving her, leaving my desolate hometown, leaving the bronze-colored moon every night, finally, I wandered out again.</p>
<p>Life seems to harbor a special hatred for me, but it also seems to harbor a special love. At such a young age, when others were being placed by their loving mothers in soft cradles, I was being illuminated by a more peculiar gaze. I am forever writhing in her arms. She makes me happy, and she makes me cry; she makes me brave, and she makes me frustrated. She smiles kindly at me, and she glares fiercely at me: I am a helpless, stubborn child.</p>
<p>Yes, I understand very well: a child who has rolled out of life's furnace, from the barren wilderness, is not easily compromised, nor is he very obedient.</p>
<p>I didn't even need to discover this myself. Even the mother who personally arranged my growth, and she who had been playing mud dolls with me since I was six years old, said in amazement:</p>
<p>"How strange: has he become so cruel? Nothing can arouse his yearning, nothing can earn his attachment."</p>
<p>It is true. All the childhood longings, infatuations, and hobbies have been completely shattered in the process of wandering. The family's intimate tone, her youthful</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>young smile, the camellias on the hillside in front of the door, the multicolored roof peaks of the ancient temple, the sun hanging on the branches at dusk... even when they appear in my dreams, they only make people reveal a bitter face. So, year after year, I have lived through it, and I have a kind of perception like a bas-relief: hazy and flat. I have learned to use ignorance to cope with a smile, a stimulus, a sorrow, just as I use intuition to accept a mountain, a river, a pile of dead branches... my thoughts are flattened, numbed.</p>
<p>So, I understand: I am ultimately happy, I am happy.</p>
<p>One day, it was late autumn, I was walking in the wilderness, a pile of ashes from dead branches lay in front of me. I looked at it, and looked at it again, and several images occurred in a peculiar succession before my eyes: a scattering of seeds, a cluster of seedlings, a row of tender branches, a falling leaf, a section of dead trunk, a pile of ashes. From the tragedy of seeds and ashes, I seemed to receive an enlightenment: a wandering origin, a wandering end. I hoped that a north wind would blow, I hoped to see the ashes swirling in the air. So, I fantasized about a grain of ash, floating, aimlessly, unknowingly, settling on an unfamiliar land. People trample on it, people neglect it, people forget it, and day by day, it is so pressed into the distant strata. It is a tragedy of nature.</p>
<p>So, I began to learn cruelty, I learned indifference, I learned the principles of the tragedy of nature.</p>
<p>In this way, even I became a little confused: what is worth yearning for? A smile? The sun? This flowing stream and purple mountain peaks? Or the unreliable disguise of human passion, and nature, which is the performance of tragedy?</p>
<p>Really, you say, what can a child born of wandering yearn for?</p>
<p>Then: forget the feelings, forget the attachments, forget the thoughts, forget the yearnings. In the process of wandering, cruelty is ignorance; and ignorance is always happiness.</p>
<p>Trembling, throwing everything behind me, I finally wandered out again. I remember a sentence:</p>
<p>"Coming naked and going without attachments!"</p>
<p>Its greatness made me shudder.</p>

<h3 id="e293">Wanting to Find a Way Out Through Literature <a href="#e293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am an eighteen-year-old child, currently living in a difficult environment. Although I want to strive for the future, I don't know if there will be a day of success in striving like this. So, I am telling you my current situation and my direction of advancement, hoping that you can give me a clear indication.</p>
<p>Since I was seven years old, my father sent me to a sailboat dedicated to sailing on the Yangtze River to do cooking work. After working hard for several years, at the age of thirteen, I started working as a boatman pulling poles and ropes. During this period, I was rolled by waves several times, and there was often a danger of losing my life.</p>
<p>At the age of fourteen, I moved from Ningbo to Shanghai. I stopped being a boatman, and my father provided tuition, so I became a student. But after the January 28th Incident, I was declared to have dropped out of school. Later, fortunately, through the introduction of my father's friend, I went to a school run by the Ministry of Communications that did not require tuition and studied for two years, and finally graduated. But it was also the time when the difficulties of life attacked me. I don't want to continue my studies anymore, because I really don't have the ability to study. But I have nothing to do. Sir, my family of six or seven people eats, and my father is just a peddler selling socks, and I don't work, how can this be maintained? So, the situation of life difficulties is really unimaginable. As for myself, I am idle every day, running around aimlessly, and what I am most interested in is going to the Shen Bao Circulation Library. Because there I can see many books without spending a penny. Also, because I can't afford the one or two yuan deposit, I have to run there every day. But sometimes, the good book that I can't finish reading today is borrowed by someone else tomorrow, and I can't continue reading it, how painful is that at that time! Of course, no matter what, reading a little good book is better than not reading at all.</p>
<p>Recently, I have been very fond of reading literature books. I desperately read those works by famous Chinese and foreign writers, and at the same time, it seems to arouse the hope in my heart, so I tried writing. And for economic reasons, I started submitting articles, hoping to get a little稿費to maintain my life. However, the results were all returned one after another, probably because the skills were too bad? So, I am now going to continue to work hard on writing, I want to抄出a way out from the literary aspect. But can I reach my goal!</p>
<p>Sir, I am now attaching my recent works, hoping that you can give me a stern criticism, and I hope you can give me some instructions on the writing method, hoping for it! Respectfully, respectfully</p>
<p>Write and rest, Long Chen 上</p>
<p>Editor's note: After reading your letter, knowing the truth about your painful life, I am very sad for you in my heart. At the same time, I see that you are struggling very hard to the environment, and there is no attitude of厭世or sorrow, which makes me feel that you are very admirable.</p>
<p>You are now studying literature, which is very good; but there is one thing you need to understand, that is, studying literature is not specifically to solve the problem of personal food, if you only work hard for personal food, then the article will not have great promise. Of course, a person always has to eat, but studying literature must never be specifically for personal food.</p>
<p>To study literature, it is not enough to study only in the scope of literature, you must also study a little social science at the same time. You must clearly recognize this society, and then you can see clearly your position in society; in this way, your article will have very good content. If you only study literature itself or its techniques, then your article at most has a little progress in technique, flowing to虛華, and the content must be unfulfilled.</p>
<p>I have already read your three manuscripts, and the writing skills have achieved considerable results, but the content is still insufficient. Therefore, you should still focus on studying and doing things in the future, learn more theories, experience more events, and the content will gradually be fulfilled. Regarding the failure of submitting articles, don't be discouraged, you should continue to learn and write, as long as you are willing to work hard, then you will always have the hope of success in the future.</p>
<p>The difficulties of life are now a very common phenomenon, and there are so many people who are more difficult than you, so you don't have to lose your spirit of progress because of the oppression of life, you should continue to fight the environment, and there is absolutely nothing that cannot be solved.</p>

<h3 id="e298">Examining the Hollywood Divorce History of 1935: A Review of the Fairbanks-Pickford Divorce <a href="#e298" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c298" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">298</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>According to a Los Angeles dispatch, the court has granted a separation to screen couple Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford. This event occupies an important page in the history of Hollywood film stars' divorces in 1935. When we recall that Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford had been married since 1920, and have now lived together for fifteen years, most people thought that this couple would grow old together. Who knew that things would turn out unexpectedly? The protagonists of this divorce case did not break up in the middle of those fifteen years, but instead separated in their later years. It is truly said that silver screen couples are fickle and can divorce at any time!</p>
<p>If we recall, in those fifteen years, rumors of separation between Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks had already emerged in the early years of their marriage. But after the parties denied it, these rumors died down. In Hollywood, this silver kingdom, the separation and reunion of silver screen couples are inherently unstable, and rumors about marriage and divorce are spread every day. Therefore, the public regarded the Fairbanks' divorce as just another common rumor. However, in the recent three years, the rumors have become even more intense, and at the beginning of 1935, this divorce case has turned from rumor into reality.</p>
<p>When they got married, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks were both in their golden age; one was the Queen of Cinema, and the other was the Emperor of Cinema. In the film industry, both were very popular; moreover, they were both among the wealthiest stars. At the time of their union, they shared the same interests in their careers and in their hearts; they were both first-class stars in Hollywood; their positions in the film industry were very stable. They were both reputable people, both loved making friends, and both were devoted to the film industry. Wasn't their union the ideal match? This is evidenced by the fact that after their marriage, the couple always shared a few sweet kisses before going to the film set, and Mary always bid farewell with tears in her eyes when Douglas went on long trips. After Douglas and Mary got married, they did not dance with other women for more than ten years, so one can imagine how deep their love was after marriage.</p>
<p>The past rumors were nothing but unfounded gossip, but in the recent three to five years, there have been repeated rumors of divorce between Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford, and in these rumors, we can see that their feelings are no longer as harmonious as before. What were the reasons for Mary and Douglas's divorce? Although there are various rumors, the filming of "The Taming of the Shrew" was a major sticking point. Although Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford had been married for fifteen years, they had only co-starred in one film, "The Taming of the Shrew," but as a result of filming this movie, the two sides had different opinions and insisted on their own views, causing a major conflict. After that, their opinions became even more incompatible, and as a result, the love between the couple broke down, leading to their separation.</p>
<p>This divorce case was of course initiated by Mary Pickford, and Douglas Fairbanks, who was approaching old age, wanted to maintain their marriage at all costs; therefore, after the rift between him and Mary Pickford, he ran to England. His purpose was nothing more than to ease the conflict and reduce Mary's anger, so that when he returned to the United States, they could reconcile and easily live in harmony again. Who knew that Douglas Fairbanks' trip to London could not quell Mary's anger. After returning to the United States, although people within the circle mediated, Mary still insisted on her divorce proposal. Finally, not long after the curtain rose on 1935, the Los Angeles court, in three minutes, ruled the divorce case valid. From then on, this so-called ideal silver screen couple went their separate ways, and everything in the past was just adding some memories to their lives.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e299">Review of "The Night Before the Wedding" <a href="#e299" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c299" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">299</a></h3>
<p>— You Jing</p>
<p>丨Paris Projection丨</p>
<p>At a time when foreign aggression is rampant and the people's morale is declining, "The Night Before the Wedding" allows us to hear the tragic, magnificent, and passionate war song: "Fight, fight, fight, all rush to the front line...</p>
<p>Avenge our hatred and snow, and bravely strive to be first" and "Kill, kill, kill, the great war has broken out, the country is in danger, quickly save China," which is worthy of our seeking and recommending its meaning.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to the outdated selection of themes and expression techniques, it not only blurs the meaningful impression it gives to the audience, but also makes the audience doubt the personality contradictions of the main character, the officer Yuan Xinghai, thus affecting the effect that the author attempts and strives to achieve.</p>
<p>The personality contradictions of Yuan Xinghai are clearly expressed in the two songs he sings himself: "Light Boat on the Lake" and "War Song." The former writes out the type of "chocolate candy officer" as the West calls it and the "hanging dandy soldier" as the Chinese vernacular says: chasing women, making triangle love, etc. The latter says that he is so "determined to sacrifice himself to do it," and actually completes his will of "men die on the battlefield" and "wrapped in horsehide." Without a proper and sufficient process in between, the two different personality prototypes are abrupt and contradictory before and after, and under the positive and negative, they are transformed into a "non-existent illusion."</p>
<p>Here, let's discuss the technical aspects of "The Night Before the Wedding." Because it is a "full sound white singing" film, then let's start with the dubbing and dialogue:</p>
<p>Speaking of dubbing, with the current material and technical limitations of Chinese sound films, some shortcomings in sound are originally not too demanding, but the impropriety of the dubbing is an undeniable fact. For example, in this "Night Before the Wedding," such as the scene where Li Minghui was chased home by Yuan Congmei to sleep, when Li raised her powder leg and smiled, accompanied by such an unharmonious and strong sound, I don't know what its function is? Here, the sound and picture not only cannot multiply each other, but also damage each other.</p>
<p>In terms of dialogue, in addition to a few places that are incomprehensible, such as saying "no personality" as "no qualifications, no humanity," it is improper, such as the dialogue between the two protagonists when reading love and love, the tone is too uninflected, resulting in a breath and grammar of anger and quarrel. As well as the unnecessary time and space for the dialogue, the dialogue repeats before and after the book and cannot play a role of multiplication and benefit.</p>
<p>The book weaving is also inevitable to lose to sluggishness, annoyance; slackness, such as when the officer tells the woman's father that he will sacrifice everything to love his daughter, the expressions of the uncle outside the door, the daughter upstairs, and the four people cannot make simultaneous, unified and different reflections, and when the officer and lover say goodbye to the woman's father on the night before the wedding, three faces cannot be woven into one picture, and so on.</p>
<p>The whole film deals with several scenes of war better.</p>
<h3 id="e300">Review of "New Woman" 丨丨 Jin Cheng <a href="#e300" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c300" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">300</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Previously, there was "Three Modern Women" that appeared on the Chinese film scene in a brand new posture, making Chinese films begin to have new changes. It had epoch-making significance, which is what people cannot ignore. The playwright of the film put forward three different women: one is a pleasure-seeking social flower, one is a petit-bourgeois woman who believes in love first, and the other is a female worker. Which of these three women is the most modern? The playwright clearly indicates that the female worker is the darling of the times, shouldering the historical task, while the disillusionment of the petit-bourgeois woman's love dreams and the pleasure-seeking of capitalist social flowers are all satirized and cursed. 丨丨 In this respect, it is a successful work.</p>
<p>Two years later, we have seen this new woman with a content that is quite similar to "Three Modern Women." The playwright also put forward three women of the same era but of different essence: one is Mrs. Wang, who quarrels with her comprador husband for a car to ride in and hooks up with actors, the same as the female worker Aying, and the other is a female writer who has a certain degree of self-awareness, but cannot withstand the torment of society, and commits suicide in contradictory life.</p>
<p>So, who is the new woman here? Although the playwright tries his best to describe the female writer's self-awareness, the contradiction between life and will ultimately leads her to commit suicide. In the end, although she has the confidence to work hard to live, hoping to endure hardship and become independent with her sister who lives with her, it is too late, she has been eliminated by the times. And Mrs. Wang's licentiousness is given a poisonous satire by the playwright. The suggestion of a new woman is naturally on the female worker Aying, and the theme song "New Woman Song" also directly explains this point: "The new woman is the production masses; ······ is the social labor, ······ is the vanguard of building a new society. New women, want to be with men······ Don't be slaves, the world is for the public! Regardless of men and women, the world is one! New women, bravely rush forward! "Yes, the new woman's life is simple, she doesn't dream of love. After Wei Ming died, they trampled on the news of her death in the newspaper and rushed forward.</p>
<p>Like "Three Modern Women," the playwright's analysis and understanding of the female group is correct, which is naturally very powerful for the lessons of intellectual women. Therefore, we only require the enrichment of the content of the work, and as for the similarity of the theme to other works, it cannot of course be regarded as a shortcoming of "New Woman." However, the theme seems to be more clichéd, so that the particularity of the work cannot be displayed, and there are still some shortcomings in the drama skills, and there are also many very dramatic places.</p>
<p>From the evaluation of the entire work, due to the relationship of the objective environment, and because Ruan Lingyu's grasp of the posture of intellectual women is not deep enough, and the dubbing has some shortcomings except for the final steam whistle that has a very good stimulus, it cannot make the work reach a completely successful level. But we can never deny that it is a fairly mature film. The screenwriter, director, photography, composer, dubbing setting, and even every actor are doing their work with the greatest efforts. We look forward to their greater success in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e301">The Exchange of Film and Drama <a href="#e301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Fu</p>
<p>Since the news of the performance of the Stage Association in Jin Cheng was announced, this cannot but make people feel gratified. At the beginning of this 1935, it is exciting that people who have gone from the stage to the screen, and most of the people who are active in drama, can cooperate so closely and hold large-scale public performances.</p>
<p>Taking January 28 as the dividing line, Chinese films have undergone new changes, and part of the reason is that the stage people have entered the film field, making them active as a driving force. But on the other hand, drama itself has been silent because of this. On the one hand, economic environment and other relations have hindered the progress of drama, and on the other hand, the fact that people who specialize in drama have been attracted by films is also a major reason. It is precisely because of the above two reasons that the Chinese drama movement has not given the audience a full understanding, because there is no lovely success in technology.</p>
<p>Now, there are very good objective conditions. The Shanghai-style Peking opera is actively falling into decline, and the general movie theaters that often sell seats with song and dance can no longer be summoned. They all demand that spoken dramas be staged, which is of great help to improving the drama atmosphere, so the slogan that 1935 is the year of drama is shouted.</p>
<p>The first public performance of the Stage Association is naturally the first shot of 1935, and the broad audience is eagerly expecting this public performance to have a great success. Yes, we expect that such a public performance with so many talents should at least be a more standard activity in terms of technology. The exchange of film and drama, we wish them great success!</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3 id="e302">David Copperfield (1) <a href="#e302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Cun</p>
<p>Produced by MGM, starring Lionel Barrymore, Louis Easton, etc.</p>
<p>David Copperfield first saw Mr. Murdstone in the chapel. Later, he gradually remembered how he met him, but it happened in a place of benevolence and righteousness, wasn't it the reversal of nature's impermanence. It was a warm summer Sunday. His widowed mother and the benevolent Peggotty, one of their maids, were happily gathered in a very small chapel. David was very happy, until he saw Mr. Murdstone looking at his mother. Although he was a very young child, he already felt that that person was not to be approached. The first time he saw him, he shivered and clung tightly to his mother's skirt, as if afraid that he would grab him.</p>
<p>He whispered to his mother: "Mom, that person, he's like a black panther in my animal book." His mother quickly forbade him: "Lower your voice! He is a friend of Mom's, don't say that." From then on, every time he saw Mr. Murdstone, he thought of that treacherous and terrifying black panther in the book, which made him feel uneasy. But he soon realized that his fear at that time was nothing, until Mr. Murdstone came to live in his and his dear mother's house, that was truly terrible. He made him tremble with fear.</p>
<p>He felt inexplicably why his mother hurriedly sent him into the car, driven by a Barkis, and asked him to go to Yarmouth and stay with Peggotty's relatives for a while. David didn't understand why his mother stayed at home and didn't go, but Peggotty told him that she was also going to stay at her friend's house for a few days. David accepted this explanation and tried his best to enjoy this trip, but he didn't know that this was the last time he had some happiness in many years.</p>
<p>He was very happy at Peggotty's house. In addition to Peggotty, who lived with him, there was Ham, Peggotty's nephew, Miss Gummidge, a close friend, who was always frowning, and Dan Peggotty, who was the brother of the old fisherman Peggotty. In addition, what David felt was lovely in his mind was little Em'ly, who often played with David on the beach. But what he found most interesting was the house they lived in. But that can't be considered a house. It was really just a broken ship that was placed high on the shore, with the bottom of the ship facing the sky, and a steel pipe standing upright on the top, which was the chimney of the house. There were also beautiful small doors and small windows, all opened on the side of the ship. David thought, how interesting it is to live in a boat on the ground!</p>
<p>When David came to Yarmouth, although Peggotty had told him not to ask too many questions, he soon found out that the rude and strong, but benevolent old fisherman, was an old bachelor. He supported so many people, Ham was his brother's son, Em'ly was his sister's daughter, and Miss Gummidge was the woman who accompanied him. The fathers or husbands of these people all died in the ruthless sea of anger and torrents, white waves and滔天.</p>
<p>But these past tragedies did not depress David and Em'ly's mood when they were wandering on the beach. Em'ly also told him that her heartfelt wish was that if she could become a noblewoman in the future, she would definitely buy Uncle Peggotty a blue coat with diamond buttons.</p>
<p>Finally, his trip was over, and he and Peggotty had to go back to see his mother. He was eager to return all the way, thinking of his loving mother. When his car arrived at the door, he jumped out of the car and ran straight into the house to see his mother. But as soon as he entered the door, he stopped abruptly. His mother was in the house, sitting in the old place by the fireplace as usual, but on that side was sitting the black panther, the person he saw in the chapel, Mr. Murdstone. He couldn't help but look at Peggotty's face in suspicion. Peggotty whispered, "That's your new dad." (To be continued)</p>
