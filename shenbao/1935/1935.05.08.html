<p>時評</p>
<h3>中國國際貿易之平衡</h3>
<p>— 仁</p>
<p>我國國際貿易。自前淸同治初年以還。無年不爲入超。所幸海外他種欵項之收入。差堪相抵。故往日除一部分人外。鮮有注意於此入超增加之可畏者。迨至昨年。銀價高騰。白銀外流。舉國惶惶。一若中國經濟難　。自此方始。實則此種白銀之所以外流。無非皆種因於歷年之入超。耳查去年報關出口之白銀共二億六千萬元。其中百分之九十以上。係由洋商銀行流出。夫洋商銀行之所以能有此巨量白銀供外流者。皆因近年來全國各地均須付進口貨之代。價之。卽暫存於洋商銀行庫中之入超欵項也。</p>
<p>國人旣因此刺戟。漸覺中國國際貿易情况。應求改善於是千方百計求入超之减少。前日（六日）實·財·外·三部且以國際貿易平衡之研究爲中心。會商討論。旣定其治本之道。爲一方宜極力培植國內生產。以期自足自給一方宜注意海外市塲。以廣推　並擬由各關係部會。共組一國際貿易委員會。研究進行。足徵政府之講求减少入超。已有積極進行之趨勢矣。</p>
<p>顧我國入超之所以增加者。其大原因有四。我國生產落後。製品不能滿足一般人之需求。一也關稅稅率過低。致使外貨得廉價暢銷。二也。我國進口貿易。多爲洋商直接經營。　使中闕人僅爲被動的銷貨者之勢。三也。出口貨减少。相對的形成入超增多。四也。故在今日而欲言减少入超。培植國內生產與注意海外市塲。固不失爲重要之辦法。而關稅之逐漸提高。與夫貿易之須由國人自營。要亦不可忽視之治本方策也。</p>
<p>不特此也。所謂生產之培植。所謂海外市塲之開拓。所謂關稅之提高。所謂貿易之自營。又莫不須以政治之統一爲推進力。蓋生產之培植。必求其能多方面之發展。而尤須有一統制全國之機關。使之不陷於矛盾。不陷於傾軋。方能著其明效。以我國過去之情形而論。省與省之間。毫無相當之聯絡。往往同一商品。甲省方在增稅。乙省則遽行免稅。或同一生產品。甲省提倡製造。乙省亦同時製造之。共甲省不製造者乙省亦不製造。如此而欲求調整國際貿易。培植國內產業。着手之難可以知矣。</p>
<p>今日我國國際貿易固亟應求共平衡。整個經濟固亟應求其獨立。但於此急迫之中。似仍不能不出之以鎭靜之態度。先研究共最根本之具體方策。然後竭全力以赴之。果能上下一心共　治本。「新中國」之產生。庶有望乎。</p>

<h3>中國文化運動之動向</h3>
<p>（意淵一講）</p>
<p>多年中輟之中國文化運動、近以受國靴之激刺、又呈重振旗鼓之氣象、一年以來、文化運動之波浪、將動　全國、而於日趨消沈之國民心理上、又將起新的感應、誠能倡導得方、不蹈覆轍、純本精誠、不尚虛浮、實未始非我民族復興運動中之一大轉機也、愚愧無似、去歲承文化學會邀請講演、人事卒卒、迄未整理講稿、就正賢達、歲月如流、忽屆五四、際此時會、倍增感慨、爰復追述大意、期與邦人共勉焉、</p>
<p>十年以來、愚苦心孤　、淡泊自勵、凡所爲文、直接間接、均爲推動吾國文化運動之發展、區區愚裏非敢立異、誠以文化者、乃一民族生命力與爭存力之表現、就其一體一而觀之、則爲一民族應付環境、改善環境、努力奮鬥所得之物質精神的總成績、就其「用」而言之、則又爲任何民族求生圖存、繁榮發展、所不可須臾或離之生活素、遠稽史乘、近察世變、古往今來、一切民族、興衰存亡之山、强弱優劣之判、莫不以其民族文化之盛衰爲總因緣、吾國過去之歷史、所以光華燦爛盛極一時者、即因文化之發展、今日所以沒落衰微、慘遭厄運者、即因文化之衰亡、中國民族於歷史上、雖亦曾一　亡於異族、而仍　不立　者、即因文化之勝利、而近百年來所以慘遭列强之屈辱者、則因文化鬥爭之失敗也、　近代世界、有一順之者生、逆之者亡、光芒萬丈、不可一世之突出現象、斯即科學文化之發展、日本初因不明此理、故亦備受列强壓迫、維新以後、亟起直追、且被迎頭趕上、故其政治·經濟·軍事·敎育、均能發生强大的力量、與歐美列强相抗衡、不幸吾國民衆、未明近代民族爭存之原理、且將吾國固有創造文化之能力、完全消失、處處不目振作、在在依賴他人、舉凡一切民族生存之方法與需要、均無創造改進之能力、此實民族褻落、以及召致國難之根本原因、吾人於此、自當深識此民埃盛衰之歷史的鐵則、亟謀民族文化之發展、以求民族生力之健强與充實、</p>
<p>雖然、文化運動、固亦貧轟動一時、顧其實效、又何在乎、此種懷疑、不可不辨、蓋以往文化運動之所以失敗、自有其無可諱飾之錯誤、初不可以其錯誤、從而抹煞文化之眞値、以往吾國文化運動所以失敗之由、舉要言之、可分三點、</p>
<p>一曰破壞的——以往文化運動者、狀其文化曰新、不知新者乃無形孕育於舊者之中、而決非無因突出於舊者之外、從而感情沖動、一味厭「舊」、凡舊者均在毀滅之例、一味趨新、而新卒離舊而　馳、至於何者爲新、羣旣無確切之印象、如何能新、羣尤無具體創建之辦法、流弊所及、吾國固有文化之優性、旣均蕩然無存、而所謂新文化者、仍渺不可得、遂使精神界大亂、鬱鬱悵悵之象、充塞天下、躁妄者、悍然莫顧是非、謹厚者、萬然喪其所守、嗚呼、此綱紀之所以失墮、而人心之所以好亂乎、</p>
<p>二曰盲從的——以往之文化運動、旣爲感情用事、盲目趨新、故新文化運動者、所稗販輸入中土者、如自由主義、如共產主義、類都未能適合於我民族之需要、近年社會·經濟·政治、各方所呈之病態、未始非可謂此種盲從的、反民族的文化運動所貽之惡果、</p>
<p>三曰虛浮的——昔楊杏佛民嘗評新文化運動有言曰、「新文化本身旣始終不曾實現、新文化運動、更是「曇花一現」久無消息的幻夢、新文化運動者、也都是一些「四方雜湊」「逢塲作戲」「各獻神通」的客串、鑼鼓散塲、仍是一個麻木不仁的社會」、故以往文化運動的結果、雖於表面上喧嚷一時、實際上則並未能推動社會、使一般民衆受其實益、易言之、新文化運動之理想、與全國民衆間、仍有極大之距離、更確切言之、即全國民衆之知識技能、　並未因文化運動而有所提高增進也、此則更應取以猛省痛改者已、</p>
<p>前事不忘、後事之師、今日從事文化運動者、首應記取以往文化運動失敗之敎訓、而正確把握今日文化運動應取之動向、今請進而分論之、</p>
<p>一爲建設的——文化之本質、既爲一民族生侖力與爭存力之表現、故文化運動之目的、不在消極的破壞、而貴在積極的建設、僅事破壞、有傷民族之元氣、勤謀建設、始能培植民族之實力、惟此之所謂建設、有兩方面之意義、把握現實、創建新制、固爲建設應有之事、然若對於吾闕固有文化優性之撿討與保存、要亦爲眞正有心於吾國文化建設者所不容漢視、</p>
<p>二爲自覺的——文化之於民族、猶諸食料之於人身、藥劑之於病人、若狼呑虎嚥、藥石亂投、非特無益身體、抑艮足以喪身、中國過夫之文化運動、即犯此弊、民族生命、危在朝夕、謹愼調養、猶虞不測、倘再不愼、危險孰甚、故今日之文化運動者、所最應警覺者、實萬不能一誤再誤、重蹈以往之覆轍、任何外來之文物制度、主義學說、祗有合於我民族精神、歷史背景、社會需要者、始有其眞值、亦准有爲我民族所消化後、始能發揮其功用、此又今後從事文化運動者所應　意而覺悟者也、</p>
<p>三爲務實的——過去之文化運動、旣未能彌補民衆程度與社會制度間之鴻講、故一般民衆之智識技能、仍未達到一般的水準、此吾國文化運動之所以虛有其表、而未能推展團運也、今日之文化運動者、首應力去其空疎浮　之弊、脚踏實地、深人民間、以謀全國民衆衣·食·住·行·實際生活之改善、生活能力之增進、大如一國政治經濟社會之制度、固應妥謀積極之創建了、推而至於全國人民生產之技能與工具、即如工人農夫、一針一鋤之微、亦應爲謀切實之改進、務使全國人民、無論士·農·工·商·男·女·老·幼、均能深受文化運動波浪之影響、而沾其實益、此則尤應切實注意之要點也、</p>
<p>總之、今日吾國文化運動、應力避以前破壞、盲從、虛浮少覆轍、而另確立其新的動向、循建設的、自覺的、務實的坦道而邁進、庶能迎合民族之需要、培養民族之元氣、提高全國民衆之智能、實充民族爭存之實力、</p>
<p>抑尤有進者、一切運動、其運動之本體、並非吾人之目的、而僅爲推行某種目的之方法、故開會演講、登報官傳、僅爲運動之手段、而非運動之目的、倘主持運動者、僅以開會演講、登報宣傳爲能事、盜虛聲、驚空名、而忘其運動固有之目的、眞實之使命、甚至怠於其平日應盡之職守、不務正業、酬酢、奔競、大言欺世、究其性行、則實不堪聞問、則一切運動、惟有驅使民衆、盡趨虛驕卑鄙之歧途、而我偉大純正之民族、亦惟有日趨墮落而已、復興云乎哉、復興云乎哉、</p>
<p>國運垂危、覆亡無日、憂時心切、不覺言之重而資之周、世之賢豪、其取吾說而力行之、雖爲執鞭所欣幕焉、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （錢澐）</p>
<p>戀愛和幸運</p>
<p>有見識的女子，不會輕易談戀愛；有見識的女子，一談戀愛，死不肯放；這種女子「幸運」固然屬了伊；但「不幸」也常緊隨了伊。</p>
<p>愛柴米的妻　　沒有柴米就想離婚的女性，諒伊一上床即呼呼地睡着了，　伊的丈夫有多量的柴米時，一定會擺架子，而這位妻子也一定會反現笑臉樂於承受。</p>
<p>初吻</p>
<p>注意你的初吻，細味你的初吻，紀念你的初吻。初吻是你人生史上，最有量，最興實，最光榮的一頁。</p>
<p>男子心腸不盡硬</p>
<p>女子們常覺男子的心腸硬得可怕，但自己有意志時：男子心腸即硬有什麽可怕；何況男子當然也不是個個壞心腸的，不壞心腸的男子，女子楚能得着眞實的帮助。</p>
<h3>別離</h3>
<p>— 蕉心</p>
<p>「生離」一向是和「死別」同爲人們所悲傷的。但是死了不可復活，別了可以重聚。最傷心的是別的時候很鮮健，等到回來時已經是一棺附身了。</p>
<p>你不要怨恨別離的悽楚，須知沒有悽楚的別離，那來甜蜜的晤聚！</p>
<p>稚年時代是不肯別離他的父母，靑年時代是不願別離他的愛人，老年時代又爲兒女的別離而老淚縱橫了。</p>
<p>別的時候怨恨着火車或輪船爲什麽不多停一刻，回來的時候又怨恨着火車或輪船的爲什麽不快些開了。</p>
<p>車站輪埠，揮者帽子和羅巾惜別的情景，最爲悽涼，所以我常說在車站輪埠上做事的人，見了這種情景而無動於中的，他們的情威簡直是麻木了。</p>
<p>獨個兒垂着頭，沒精打彩地，踽踽地踱着離開車站的，這定是剛剛送別的。</p>
<p>劉備的伐木送徐庶，固然是他的情重，但是我說一半還是他用的權術。</p>
<p>伍尚因爲念於要和他的父親見面，以致與其父同罹於難；當時如果聽了他老弟的話，他又何至於死，就是他的父親也不見得就會送命。別與聚雖然是小事，卻也不能不以理智來尅制情感啊。</p>
<h3>扒手趣談</h3>
<p>— 汪瘦秋</p>
<p>提起扒手來，眞可以說是名滿天下，無論什麽人，對於他總有相當的認識，或者還有不少的讀者，曾經被他扒過呢！尤其是輪船碼頭；火車站上；以及熱鬧的戲院：遊藝塲等處，更是若輩　集的地方。所以旅行的旅客；熱　塲所的觀客，隨時有被扒的可能。</p>
<p>據說：扒手也有訓練的，他們扒到的東西，必須等待三天以後，才能夠變換，因爲恐怕失主是個一提起此馬來頭大」的人，那末所扒的東西，還得要提給他。大概是王瑚吧？他在江蘇省長任內，曾被扒手光顧過　　　　還是他才到南京，還沒有接任的時候，因爲他衣服很是儉樸，所以扒手們竟認做十老兒，把他的一個皮篋扒去。於是這位王省長勃然大怒，立傳警察廳長來斥責，並且限期追還原物，沒有幾小時，居然人贓並獲，有眼不識泰山，難怪要大觸霉頭了！</p>
<p>任何人都知道扒手是秘密的勾當，但是蘇俄却有一種公開的扒手，這種扒手時做國際扒手，當地政府來利用他們偵查旅客，這種在表面上雖然是不檢查旅客，而實際上倒反比檢查來得厲害。當然啦—這種扒手—其實是竊賊—是有月薪可拿的，而且還有政府的保護，眞可以傲視我國的扒手了！</p>
<h3>來源不暢！</h3>
<h3>水獄優於地獄</h3>
<p>— 契重</p>
<p>本刊上，前有一篇德孚先生的水獄」，說是在澡堂裏做者擦背工作的人，一天到晚浸在水蒸氣中，其苦比之一般人稱爲最苦職業之「打鐵，撑船，磨豆腐」還要苦，所以稱他們——擦背的人——是在水獄之中，是的，擦背工作，確比打鐵撑船磨豆腐的職業還苦；因爲，打鐵之人，在夏天雖似受着砲烙之刑，但到了冬天，因爲有火驅寒，終算過着幾天快樂生活的；撑船之人雖在冷咧的嚴冬喝着西北風，可是，在月白風淸的夏夜，確也過着幾天詩人的生活；磨豆腐呢，現在因科學發達，有許多已利用電氣，不必深夜工作了；卽是深夜工作，白天也得睡覺，比之浸在水蒸氣中的擦背朋友當然比較要好一些。但我以爲在水獄中的人，苦則苦矣，其苦還不如在地獄中之人也。所謂地獄中人，卽在地獄中工作之人，也卽是礦工是也。礦工走進坑去採礦，坑中異常黑暗，可以算得進了不見大日的地獄。而且坑中空氣異常污濁，且又十分潮濕，故礦工之身體不但因得不到淸潔的空氣而衰弱不堪，並且還大都患有濕病。他們走進坑去工作，常常一進去要半個月才能到地面上來見見太陽，則比之擦背的每天可以走到澡堂門外，其苦樂相差正不知有千萬倍！擦背之人，疲乏時可以抽一口紙姻，而礦工是根本不能的。不幸而地面陷落，則礦工就活葬地獄之中，要逃也無法逃的。所以，採礦工人之入坑工作，他也就抱着犧牲性命之心，若在工作了半月而再到地而，如得再生，故必狂嫖火飲的來快樂一下。因爲他們的苦比之水獄中還要苦到幾十百倍，而他們工作處又是在地下，稱礦穴爲地獄，想來終無人會加以反對吧！</p>
<p>風土小誌</p>
<h3>日本木屐</h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>在日本住居，不論任何地方，耳朵裏總是聽得閣閣閣的太屐聲音。尤其是一個日本女子穿了木屐，在水門汀的人行道上走着，其聲淸脆，使人起異樣的情感。我國古時爬山賞雪也穿木屐，現在內地鄉下，或還有人在下雨天穿着自製的木展罷。日本的木展，總稱爲「下駄」種類　多，全世界中沒有一個國家的靴子，和日本相同的。所以說「下駄」是日本的代表物，也無不可。</p>
<p>「下駄」分有齒和平底兩種，上面都有兩條帶子，扣着腳趾。在兩條帶交义的地方，就是嵌在大趾二趾的縫裏。天冷了，他們便穿一種特製的短襪，名「靴下」用單層或夾層的布縫成的。很像乎套一樣，大趾和其他的足指分開，於是可以夾住「下駄」的帶子。男子襪子的都是黑色，女子大都穿白色或其他顏色，但是並無花紋。</p>
<p>農夫穿着「草鞋一，在田中耕作，形式和我國人力車夫所穿的相像，也有繩子扣住腳跟。普通所着的「草履」，又不司了。並不用稻草做成，是以很細的草鞭編成。價值稍貴，有幾十元一雙的富貴品。像草履履的樣子，還有用木製　軟木製的兩種。木製的上面有漆和美麗的花紋，是女子特用的。</p>
<p>天晴所穿的「下駄」，種類很多，有「駒下駄」，」日和下駄等名稱。這屐齒很短，是整塊木頭有時加上一塊皮，以防泥污。女子所穿的，大都用各色皮革護足，普通有紅綠兩種。摩登和裝女子，也穿木屐，很像一片高跟皮鞋的鞋底。還有一種木屐，下面　去一部，走路的時候，發出殼殼殼的聲音，大抵未成年女子所穿的。普通木屐，價在半元以上，可用年餘。</p>
<p>沒有漆有的木屐，男女並無分別，五色帶子的大都是男子和中年以上的女子所用。做木屐都用桐木，軟而較輕。齒上常釘著橡皮，以減少聲浪，可見日人自己也覺得行走的聲音太大了。日人家裏都舖蓆子，淸潔異常。凡是回到家裏，都要脫去「下　」，地襪走進室內。房室較大的人家，還要換了拖鞋，走過通路，於是再脫去拖鞋，地襪進房。從前日本並無拖鞋，所以名之曰Slippcro中國人沒有換鞋子的習慣初到日本，無不叫苦連天。</p>
<p>現在日本人穿皮鞋西裝的很多，摩登女子穿高跟鞋的也不少，因脫換便利起見，都買很大的尺寸，鞋條也扣得很鬆。加之拖慣木展，雖然穿了皮鞋，也是一拖一拖，滑稽之至。我國市上常有日本套鞋出售，那知日本人並不穿用。那里另有一種長統套鞋，和軍隊裏馬靴一樣，價兩元餘，穿的人很少。有一種橡皮底黑布面的快靴，那是工人和人力車夫所穿的。</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十二回　慚愧沒衣裳垂帷避各辛勤省膏火拂曉抄書</p>
<p>我現在有點小小的志願，打算邀合一些同志，編輯那帶地方性的教科書，以及成人敎育的書籍。你想，那二十多歲的人，讓他受兒童教育，偏在西北高原上的人，讓生長江南的編輯先生，在書上吿訴他一些江南社會的情形，那怎能適宜？周有容昂着頭回了屋頂，歎一口長氣，然後向志志前道：程先生，你是有心人。可是有什麽用？譬如我，雖不是賢吏，至少也不是貪官，可是我就讓八大爺打跑了。我一肚做縣長的計盡，一樣沒辦，只是和人家籌了大半年的軍餉。説畢，又歎了口氣。志前道：現在各省軍人，都有些覺悟了，政治或者在不久有上軌道的一天……周有容伸手將臉用勁一抹，表示把剛才的話取消，笑道：不要提到我，還是說你的罷。說了半天，你都是說到學生方面的，關於先生方面的，又是怎麽樣呢？志前想了一想，微笑道：我們同在陝西作客，究竟還有不能明暸之處，關於這一層，請我們這位老弟報吿罷。他有親戚在內地教書，他可以報吿一點材料。說著，望了王北海。他在未說話之前，竟也是　歎一口氣，似乎說出來，又是一篇淒　文章呢。（一九九）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>有一天的早上，我們都準備好了，快要隨太后出去上早朝的時候，突然有一個太監氣急敗壞的撞將進來，滿臉堆着一種了不得的鄭重的意態，似乎惟恐誤了什麽大事般的急忙：地帶來了一個報吿。</p>
<p>「老佛爺」！他興奮得像一頭猴子一樣，跪在地上嚷道：「奴婢方才　見那黑竇玉已生了四頭小狗了，所以趕着來稟報」。</p>
<p>太后一聽，眸子裏立刻就閃出一種表示喜悅的光芒來。這裏所說的「黑寶玉」，乃是一頭狗的名字：狗是太后所癖愛的東西，至少也可以說是太后所癖愛的許多東西中的一種。伊旣然愛狗，自然就要養狗，而伊的養狗，却又和尋常人大不相同；伊把這事看得非常的重大，一些不輕忽，伊特地教人搜集了許多講論怎樣選擇狗種，怎樣分配飼料，和怎樣訓練小犬等等各項專門技術的書來，讓伊自己在閑暇的時候閱讀研究，所以伊的狗可說無一不是譜系分明，久著良譽的佳種。</p>
<p>太后也曾問過我，究竟我對於狗這一種畜生，又沒有什麼興趣？我吿訴伊我也是跟伊一般的愛弄狗；這倒是眞話，我至今還是很歡喜狗咧！而我當日在太后那裏所見的那些狗，尤其覺得名貴可愛，它們多半是眞正的北京小種狗，頭和鼻子都是很短的，不過它他的毛片卻並不一律，各種花色都有。（三〇九）</p>

<p>金雞補空活動</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、近月市氣仍滯、形勢漫散、多數心理看小、然有一部分、因底盤已枯、拋賣之意未見濃烈、故塲中交易又見冷寂、塲中空頭、視形勢一定、活動抵補、結果各月均比上日收盤價漲二·三·四·五·角、午後開盤較堅、因現紗銷路尚有一千四百包之譜、豫粵兩帮採辦最多、人氣略緊、但拍至收盤、突然轉疲、因裕大賣出、市盤忽鬆、各月回跌二·三·角、足見人心尚挫、結果各月比上午收盤價漲跌一·二·角、查賣出大豐三百五十包、穗隆三百五十包、泰昌三百五十包、長豐一千五百包、裕大一千一百五十包、德記四百包、昶記四百五十包、潤康六百包、恒昌五百五十包、買進、通記三百五十包、合興三百包、協成三百五十包、信誠七百五十包、益大四百五十包、大豐三百五十包、永昌六百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>北地云旱　棉花多方屹然不動</h3>
<p>花邇來棉市日形堅硬、塲上買氣較濃、實因一般棉商心思看好、拉力殊強、查其心意謂各廠存貨不旺、比高價時已跌四五元光景、且華北一帶、天時太旱、新棉難以耕種、然西商在十月期步步拋空、已超過萬擔以外、</p>
<p>鄭標籌碼時現枯象</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、各月平平、但美棉趨跌、印棉英皇紀念停市但標金市價稍漲、拍至三盤、市價步開步硬、因一般浮空、拋額太多、檯面一緊、買者愈增、近來北方天時久早無雨、對於新棉殊覺不利、人心尤堅、結果各月比上日收盤價均漲</p>
<p>角至二角、午後開盤仍挺、賡豐又來補空、塲中籌碼絞枯、多方屹然不動、各月又漲角至一角半、詎至收盤時、紗市轉軟、廠家需要不旺、海外棉市消息看疲、各月回落一角半、結果本月比上午價漲角、遠月均勿動、查賣出大豐一千六百擔、梅記四千三百担、森康九百擔、永大一千一百擔、明德一千四百擔、潤康一千七百擔、長和一千三百擔、買進裕康一千四百擔、大孚一千五百擔、通記千五百擔、錦昌二千二百擔、合興三千一百擔、慎昌一千擔、長豐一千六百擔、賡豐四千一百擔、源興昌一千五百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>糧食　期麥頓受天時支配</h3>
<p>故見先漲後跌</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、先漲後跌、以洋麥報價、芝加哥好八分至一角零、坎拿大停市、當開價後、因前日粉銷仍好之餘風、人心頗見昂貴、各月份喊價、均好二分左右、以後各廠、則以粉市逺期回跌、天時又極良好、故人心轉軟、較初開回跌一二分、迨至下午開盤、各月份市面、盤旋之中、仍帶鬆動、因天時旣好、於新麥前途、仿彿有間接之感想、人心之疲、當又關時令矣、結果七月份小一分、九月份小一分、餘未動、現麥市面見交仍暢、價亦穩固、高貨又喊起二分、因到貨雖仍接續、銷亦活絡、開宿州煽動麥四元零二三分、河南麥三元九角七分、蚌埠麥三元九角九分、江北麥三元九角一分、駐馬店麥三元八角一分、由　新去一千五百包、阜豐去一千包、信大去四千包云、</p>
<p>海外小麥、春麥之展望頗佳、陳麥月份未有壓力、市況似有盤旋之勢、上週可見供給減消二百零六十八萬斛、</p>

<p>砟日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、初穩繼則近堅遠跌、以洋麥報價、芝加哥好八分至一角零、坎拿大無市、當開價時、本月份因北洋帮銷胃接淡、各廠之貨、須按批軋裝、因此人心逐步續好、遠期初開、以近期之故、曾昂起一分左右、至二盤以後、本月份市面、依然緊張、高至四角八分、四月份以下、則以天時良好、廠家及浮多、一致猛出、故市面遂步步反跌也、迨至下午開盤、各月份趨勢、仍見鬆動、本月份因客帮停乎、亦稍回　、遠期史以臼暖風和、又復繼軟、至北洋帮之動辦不已、半因　糧價仙亦昂、各地之粉存不厚、今在青黃時節、故有貪求之現象也、結果本月份仍好七厘半、六月份小二厘半、七月份小七厘半、八月份小一分二厘半、九月份小分半、十月份小、分七厘半云、</p>
<h3>紅糧逐步上漲</h3>
<p>芝麻底積豊厚</p>
<p>昨日黃豆行情無甚軒輊、惟市場中交機易比較活絡、共計做開各豆六七千包、由廠家本街內地辦去所以一部份人心看好、苞米行請立定、紅糧東洋帮銷化不新、內地亦不懈、故市面逐步上升、咋歸德糧已開三元三角九、成交三百餘包、毫州糧一車、價爲元九角一、蚌埠糧一車、價爲二元八角八、　溪口糧一百餘包、價爲三元一角、洋莊芝蔴自怡和寶隆沙遜等辦進一千噸淨貨後、（價自八元八角三至八角半、）近幾日因英商慶祝休假已多日無市、市塲中毛貨有東洋帮及本街華南等去路、故市面平定、但其大局因底積豐厚（約近二十萬包）致市不易挺榮耳、</p>
<h3>客秈內地云胃復活</h3>
<p>洋米初以連日到頭不絕、而咋今又有新到、三號西貢及米　米采等尚有路貨及新定續到、故市士人心不免搖動、但內地去胃始終不衰、咋日胃口仍濃、北洋長江及本街等亦稍應酬、市面因此復歸穩定、全市售開現洋米一萬六千多包、路貨一萬包、客秈亦開糙米等三千包左右、客秈以內地去胃復活、市而略帶俏一二分、其他均居平站云、</p>
<p>杜米（滬南）咋日各帮來源到三十號、（貸近六千石、）銷塲如本街程懈、包胃有秦皇島帮辦四五儎、數共五百餘包、大勢似成判銷兩平、而市色居平足之局、若各厚　及薄稻價悉無榮辱、觀後市形勢、似乎盤盤血已、陰變元亦無甚上落、（滬北）昨日河下各路來源約二十號、市上各貨去　轉淡、白粳高料售價勉立、中次疲去數分、早薄稻明定暗疲、白元高定、中次　修數分、具餘各色平庸之勢、</p>

<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、形勢突趨熱鬧、英商協和錦隆天裕等行、及華茶公司、對於遂安溫州土莊等路之珍眉綠茶、均因新茶出貨不湧、船　將届、進　異常濃厚、全市共計成交一千三百餘箱、交易頗形旺盛、其中路莊遂安貨、市盤開至九十元、較前堅漲一二元、到貨業已完全銷罄、此外祁門紅茶、已有六百餘箱運抵杭州、日內當可到滬云、</p>
<h3>糖市　加稅實行說又起　轉口荷精白漲角半</h3>
<p>昨日糖市、以六月一日加　有實行之說、故人心復趨活動、市勢轉緊、公會劃盤二四荷粗白初劃十六元四角、後升四角二分、出戶亦缺、比升二分、轉口貨五月十八日可到者五元三角、現貨五元三角半、比升角半角其計成交千餘包、太古糖B　本棧貨叫十七元四角、本廠綿白亦帶緊、振裕號呌十五元九角、四明一號十五元八角、　三四號均照退、四明一號冰廿元七角、二號念元六角、晚盤有潮帮開出海南赤二百六十餘包價爲十元○五角、無變動、</p>
<h3>南北貨　黑瓜子繼漲增高</h3>
<p>黑瓜子自廣帮採辦大批後、閩帮繼之亦有收採、故趨勢大爲振奮、號盤逐步轉堅、如上檔濟魁子開十一元六角至八角、高徐魁子開一百包、九元九角、普通二百數十包、九元四五角至九　、明光子叫八元卡成、查統市存底尚有二萬五十包、爲數已薄、故行盤濟魁子呌十二元、高徐魁予呌十元、普通九元半至九元一二角、宜防續緊，　現在去　旣暢、行家復從小數抬價、故漲勢較盛、</p>

<h3>「女界文明燈」</h3>
<p>— 寒峰</p>
<p>晚淸彈詞小說，近來又得到一種書名一繪圖二十世紀女界文明燈彈　，著者署名鐘情心靑，平權閣主人校，宣統三年六月明明學社出版，石印橫本，大約是常時門板書攤發賣的讀物。書前有平樣閣主人弁言，其論彈詞云：</p>
<p>「方今社會，無論何等人，均競尚彈詞小說。以滬上論，不下數百處。而彈詞尤爲婦女所信用，往往履　交錯，笑語相關。而隅坐者唱開場，則肅然無一譯者。旣畢，口講指劃，津然其書，不過三笑姻緣落金扇等淫奔苟合之事，而美其名臼才子佳人，使聽者目眩神移，傳爲美談，轉相仿效，此社會所以墮落也。故改良良徐建一司，不啻編一女學敎科書」。</p>
<p>彈詞影響之廣大，書場之衆多，售彈詞之惡效果，改良之必要，於此均足見之。作者在書裏，也一樣的論到這舊彈詞之不適宜於當世，以及這一本改良「女界文明燈」的好處：</p>
<p>女學沉淪千載久，教科書要算七言腔。妙不過，教忠教孝教貞節，就是有些過當，也是他未脫經生論幾章。任姒餘風猶未熄，這　詞算得魯靈光。只愁惡果重重結，才子佳人事佈揚。果報錄，描寫採蘭兼　　：雙珠鳳，提倡竊玉與偷香。蓀生花，一夫多婦倫常壞；再生緣，女扮男妝亂紀綱。那有此，七字築成平等界，一聲喚醒綺羅香。平添百兆完人格，不數三千粉黛行。</p>
<p>作者對於這部彈詞是很自負的，所以道白中也有：「特撰女界文明燈彈詞，專爲改良女子社會起見。憑著法鼓海螺，發人猛省：或者可挽回大局，扭轉乾坤」。「文明斐疊調鏗鏘，最合閨中女兒腸」的話。不過，雖並不能如作者所說，有那樣的影響，但他這一種另拓新境的精神，是可貴的。因為在彈詞小說中，舊的作品，除很少很少的面外，是始終跳不出「才子佳人」，「英雄兒女」兩型，而作者能有這樣的眼光，總算是難能。</p>
<p>書凡八　：立敎，天足，遊藝，迷信，童養，破獄，茶會，拒約。用美　批茶女士的精靈到東方，在曲阜訪孔母，輸送歐西的文明開場。每齣內容，就回目里大體能以看出，要加說明的，就是「破獄」是寫把童養媳從黑暗的家庭裏搶出來，「拒約」是寫美國的華工禁約，中國的排貨運動，「茶會」寫開通風氣的男女自由聚會。第一，齣開塲云：</p>
<p>解釋國民責任，要盡自由本分。莫道是裙</p>
<p>釵，男女出來平等。平等平等，閒讀盧梭政論（旦上引，如夢令）</p>
<p>此頗可說明當時寫作界中的一種風氣，就是要盡量的運用新名詞，新術語，以炫其新學之深。小說「新孽鏡」裏，曾經把這一傾向，挖苦得很厲害，說有一個新學家，把新名詞錄成秘册，稿子寫成後，就秘冊檢出可用的，把它一一地嵌進去，換掉原稿的舊用語。此固未免過分，但傾向之盛，是可見的。「文明燈」雖也運用新名詞，大處雖是很自然的。其餘而的例外，如「夫婿多才，識得梵王之字；室家安靜，閒翻盧梭之書一，却並不多。全書之中，「拒約一裏的唱詞，是最可讀：</p>
<p>一木屋幽囚新入境，夢魂淒斷舊家鄉。想起那美洲初闢虧誰力，斬棘除荊是俺黃種當。到今日土地廣開忘汗血，便把俺同胞凌虐似半羊。想起來，一般都是他洲客，不過是別種無如白種強。只要像日本近來能自立，便逢迎到處廣稱揚。今番苛約從新訂，莫道吾民容易逞剛強。且喜紳商謀抵制，不銷美貨拒重洋。</p>
<p>關於「華工禁約」的文學作品，我見到的，有梁啟超「新大陸遊記」（新民叢報臨時增刊）裏的一章，小說「拒約新譚」，「苦社會」等，在彈詞方面，此是第一種。像這樣文字的效力，毫無疑意的，是比咬文嚼字的作品來得大。「文明燈一的內容，確是如作者所說，是一部教科學，介紹女性維新的新智識。</p>
<p>我所見到的這八齣書是上卷，下卷出否不可考，因當時出書，大都是分次的，同時印一部的很不多。但即此也能窺到全體了。此書現在是比「庚子國變彈詞」更難得，「國變彈詞」出通人手，又是綫裝，尚有人收藏，像此類門板書，恐怕並收藏者也無了。逐回有挿圖一幅，間有佳者。</p>
<p>附記：前作「又和團彈詞」一義，後得「國變彈詞」，始知前者卽是讀書首二十回，係冒名翻印的本子，事實上並非兩書，望讀者注意。</p>
<h3>生的疲困</h3>
<p>— 已而</p>
<p>負着生活的重擔，我辛苦地走了將近十年的人生旅途，到現在，已覺得筋疲力窮，無法再繼續趕上這未完的前程！</p>
<p>世途是平坦的還是崎嶇的？或許是平坦的呢？我看見有些人走得旣輕鬆又舒暢，一絲痛苦的樣子都沒有。就是我自己，在十年前的十幾年中，當我給別人帶着走，肩上的生活的擔子，送未壓下來的時候，不是也一樣走着一條平坦的世途嗎？然而又分明是崎嶇的。十年來的我，和合我同一運命的一羣，就喫了這崎嶇的世途的無限苦味。受盡風霜雨露的侵襲打擊不消說，兩隻足又那一刻那有給路上的荊棘刺得發痛流血！</p>
<p>想是因爲當時年少力壯的緣故吧，或者因爲生活的擔子輕一點，初上征途的幾年中，我的精神是興奮的，心情是快樂的，氣概是勇敢的，意志是堅強的，希望是光明的。在路上，無論受着最大的痛楚，碰着最重的阻得，都不能使我的前進的腳步畏難而退縮。可是現在却怎樣了呢？</p>
<p>現在，我在這人生的旅途上，感到了極度的困倦了！我也知道，人生的旅途，是只有去道，而沒有後路的。我們應該奮發地向前進，才是辦法。向後退，就會滅亡。但是要前進，我委實太辛苦的了！肩上日漸加重的擔子，已沒有氣力去掮負了。身心所遭受的磨折，是磨折夠了。便是再要掙扎，也有點艱難了。我承認我是怯弱！我得暫時在這半途旁邊，停下足來喘息一下。然而我可能這樣嗎？</p>
<p>我伸仰着脖子向前望去，前程的遠近，不得而知。牠阻隔着山和水，雲和霧，重疊而且渺茫。可是呵，卽使是這遠近不可如，重疊而且渺茫的路程，我也不能不勉強地振作起我的已消散了的精力，負起這生活的重擔。喘着氣，滴着汗，辛辛苦苦地向前一步一步的走上去，走到這人生旅途的盡處，當我還活着的時候。我眞不敢回過頭去看那跟在我背終鞭策着我的生活的惡魔的猙獰可怕的面目！</p>
<h3>決鬬</h3>
<p>— 凡海</p>
<p>我和你的仇，</p>
<p>仇過殺父之仇！</p>
<p>天上，</p>
<p>沒有兩個太陽；</p>
<p>地上，</p>
<p>沒有兩個帝王，</p>
<p>請你到那廣塲，</p>
<p>我一定要和你决鬬，</p>
<p>你把人類涂灰，</p>
<p>你這好無忌憚的混蛋！</p>
<p>請你不要裝起那懦怯的可憐相，</p>
<p>現在，</p>
<p>我和你要算一算賬！</p>
<p>讓你想一想過去的耀武揚</p>
<p>威吧！</p>
<p>總算是幾多年來，</p>
<p>我喘着氣匍匐在地下，</p>
<p>如今，</p>
<p>我要豎起鐵　的頭髪，</p>
<p>我要衝破地壳，</p>
<p>來和你爭奪曬在地上的太陽！</p>
<p>懦怯漢，走去！</p>
<p>到那廣塲！</p>
<p>有靑天作證，</p>
<p>我來和你决團！</p>
<p>二，八，一九三五！</p>
<h3>悼（上）</h3>
<p>— 枕石</p>
<p>我應當以哭泣來代替一切追悼你的言詞。但是，當我知道了你的死訊的時候，我也並沒有哭泣，我祇是　默，靜默，就在這　默之中，我心中演着極大的隱痛。我自己也很覺得奇怪，幾年來殘酷的磨折，我完全失去了哭的本能。一切對於我，都祇有憤恨，你知道，憤恨嚙着我的心，那疼痛的程度是比哭泣還要難受的啊！</p>
<p>去年的這個時候，我們的母親是給疾病糾纏着死去了。那時我也幾乎哭不出眼淚，哭不出聲音，祗是母親一生爲兒女受罪的往事重重，無休七的湧上心頭，像是一根　銳的鑽針，刺着我的心，刺着我身上的每一塊肉。在母親死去的一剎那時分，當她紋痛得大聲嘶喊到沒有了聲音也沒有了氣息的時分，我們的老父是痛哭着，　妹是痛哭着，我的妻是痛哭着，甚至於我的幼子也在夢中痛哭着。但是啊！二弟，你是不知道當時母親死去的慘狀，雖然她在臨終的前一天，並不曾忘懷幾年來昔信全無的你，可是到現在，我才知道你已經是先母親一年死去了。</p>
<p>當夕陽陽荒草，暮鴉飛鳴的瓦爍塲中，黃塚壘壘，我將何處覓尋的屍骨？而且無形的欄柵阻隔了我的歸程，我又怎能走向你的墓地膜拜呢？哦！人間無限恨，何處哭孤魂？二弟啊！我祗合仰望蒼天，讓眼淚水逺向心頭流去！永逺，永遠，又是淒涼，又是憤恨，</p>
<p>幾年來的磨折，使我變成消失了情感的不完全的人，但是深刻的印象，有時仍能喚起我的回憶。記得是一個中秋日的晚上，我開始逃弁，開始漂流到天涯海角去做一個流浪的人。</p>
<h3>偷芋</h3>
<p>— 李三郎</p>
<p>黑的夜，南方的郊野是廣漠地展開着一個大而黯黑的布幕似地，疏疏的村莊都在夜色裏悄悄地沉沒了，像巨大的惡魔似的樹林沙沙地作響，是可怕的悲哀的怒吼聲和女人們灑着淚似的悽切，高低不平的山崗還可以隱約地給人的眼晴捉模着，水田間的禾稈跟着路邊的荒草輕輕地飄盪。</p>
<p>人們在都夢裏似地，只可以疏遠地聽到多事的狗兒們在吠。</p>
<p>沒有月亮，天空盡是悽愴。幾粒還在掙扎着似的小星兒吐出一種哭着的光芒。</p>
<p>阿乾嫂悄悄地挑着　箕和鋤子在慣熟的叢生着荒草的山徑上輕聲地跑着。躡手躡腳的，生怕給人家看見了似地。雖然那麽黑而冷靜的山野裏，他毫不担心有鬼魔或野獸噬了她的，她頂怕的還是在綠林里　出了一個人來。——唉，偷芋，偷芋的賊。萬一會給人家捉住了的話，不但罰十塊而且還要出醜呢！然而，出醜倒不怕，這日子，偷東西的夠多，像那麽有錢的二嬸，還請了許多人來耕種，偷別家的就沒良心，呸！偷她家的誰說不該？不過，萬一，十塊錢那裏拿？根本就是沒有喫，丈夫病着才這樣幹的。</p>
<p>想着，跑着，心兒忐忑地跳。——一擔也得三五塊……</p>
<p>田野裏是死了的，沒有動盪的聲音，只是風，只是掠人心胸的風，好像尖利的箭子，一根一根地穿過她的緊張的心頭。她那一雙深着的疲倦而飢餓的眼睛，在黑夜裏放着光芒。</p>
<p>在一條一條的高凸着的芋田上，她忙手忙腳地翻鋤有浮鬆的泥土。跟着一個一個的像野鼠似的有着皮毛的芋頭滾出來，圓的，長的，小的，成雙的，像黃金一般動盪了她底心；是的，她從沒有這樣興奮地微笑過，在黑夜裏可以隱約地露出了她那長長的臉兒底笑痕。</p>
<p>大地上沒有聲，她很害怕自己的鋤子會驚動了隔一個山林的看更的男子漢。——馬上，幾個模糊的可怕的血似的臉兒放出了獰笑，幾桿槍向她描準似地，粗大的繩子，還有二嬸那胖胖的嘴把，老是不斷氣地嘖嘖地罵，爛臭貨，老　　（註：卽妓女），那怪難看的樣子，蛇似的聲息不斷地湧出她底腦袋。半個月前阿四嫂不是那麽地給他們拖進團保局去嗎？——咦！多麽可怕的哪。</p>
<p>心神鎮定了，急速地裝進畚箕里，三四十斤的鮮芋在她的肩膀上是感不到沉重的，可是，她感到擔子後面有什麼可惡的傢伙拖着似的，她越害怕給人追上，兩個腿越要拚命地飛跑着，口里喘着氣，人兒好像激流似地盪動，等到她把擔子挑到自家的厠坑里的時候，心里才安定地，她連忙地把芋頭埋進每天從家里挑出來的一大堆的火灰里，扔下擔子，才裝作平常到厠坑里撒了屎歸來的樣子走了。</p>
<p>第二天的早上，村里就傳遍了有人偷了二嬸家的芋的消息，那胖胖的女人，就像失了黃金似的罵着：</p>
<p>「偷了我的芋的會有天雷打死他，不是死亡八就是爛臭貨，你！吃了我的芋的一定不吉利……」</p>
<p>管她呢，阿乾嫂暗里微笑，而且還計劃着怎麼樣挑到市塲里去賣了。</p>
<h3>三天（五）</h3>
<p>— 羅洪</p>
<p>黃忠樸又露出了上排的焦黃牙齒，額角上六七條皺紋緊緊的擠在一起，一副嘴臉可憐得怕挨打似的，好像他就是有發或是有才，陸大爺一句話他就恭恭敬敬地接應一下。他最明白陸大爺的脾氣，別人跟他執拗了，他決不肯輕易放着過去：有發他們如果不答應這個條件，陸大爺生起氣來，非但不肯借錢，也許再有別的手段，醫如……</p>
<p>他黃忠樸眞好比做了陸大爺肚子裏的迥蟲，陸大爺果然站起身子，忽忽丟了二分長的烟屁股，小聲兒向他說：</p>
<p>「今天一十七是不是？」</p>
<p>「昨天二十六——對的，今天時二十七。」</p>
<p>「那麽他向龍會借的二百塊錢，只有三天就到期，哼，龍會的錢那一個敢拖延一天半天，他們總得想法子。我說，忠樸——」</p>
<p>陸大爺又向黃忠樸走近一步，怪親熱的樣子。「你去對地保說一聲，呌他到有發家去催得緊一點，看他們強到那裏去！」</p>
<p>黃忠樸連聲應着。他心上有股膩膩的感覺，每逢陸大爺跟他表示點親熱，就覺得心上怪膩膩地，像是給女人的手撫摸着似的。他做了陸大爺的心腹，靠陸大爺每年貼補他五六十塊錢，到現在已經有二十多年，那種膩膩的感覺却只有過三次。一次是鬧蟲荒那年，做成龍會的時候，縣裏王師爺他們要把存米放在鄉公所裏，算是積穀的地方，陸大爺急得什麼似的，要黃忠樸想法子。他才出了個主意，呌地保他們對王師爺那些人說，穀子放在鄉公所靠不住，鄉公所裏的人嘈雜，也許有什麽差兒，沒人負資。陸大爺家裏有寬大的穀倉，只要分出兩間就夠用了，而且陸大爺素來熱心公益，他决不疼着這兩間屋子不肯借用。這樣幾次一說，事情果然成功了，那時候陸大爺曾誇他能幹，很親熱地贊他。第二次是去年的事，陸大爺做過五十歲的壽，還沒得個兒子，娶上三房姨太太，都只生女的，陸大爺很看重「無後爲大」這個不孝的罪，所以對這椿事是十分憂鬱的。黃忠樸明白他的苦衷，便做了個媒。他常聽陸大爺說周四的女兒很美的，要是衣着好一點，比他三個姨太太都美，於是他再三跟周四商量，本來許的親化一百塊錢解了約，那瓜子臉的周四的女兒，便做了陸大爺第四房的姨太太了。也算這毛頭姑娘有福份，居然生了個男孩子，於是在滿月那天請酒的時候，陸大爺曾親熱地敬過他杯酒。現在這一次，便算是第三次了。</p>
<p>「只有三天的期，大爺你放心，他們逃不到那裏去的，沒有你大爺他們偕不到錢。有才那小子再倔強些也沒用，龍會的錢到期總得還，不怕他　住老婆不許做奶媽！」他也學着陸大爺那　說　的樣子，好像讀文章那樣，把每個字抱得很長。</p>
<p>「唔……唔唔，」陸大爺在喉頭　着，兩隻乎筒在袖管裏，低下頭踱着方步。　這樣子黃忠樸知　不必再跟他說什麽話，陸大爺已經想到了什麼心事。於是黃忠挨便告辭着走了出來。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>太原妓女實行燙髮和穿高跟鞋</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>山西省大家知道是一個風氣很純樸的地方。然而現在聽說，太原妓女要一律燙髮和穿高跟鞋起來了，這倒有點異樣。</p>
<p>妓女燙髮和穿高跟鞋，本不算希罕。所奇怪的是，太原妓女的實行燙髮和穿高跟鞋，並不是妓女自己的願意，而是人家迫她們必須如此。</p>
<p>可是你不要誤曾，以爲山西省的風氣，是快要變了。須知現在太原妓女的燙髮和穿高跟鞋，不僅不是有意要趨向奢華，而是想使本來純樸的風氣，更加純樸起來。</p>
<p>原來太原妓女要一律燙髮和穿高跟鞋，其用意是在：「與良家婦女有所識別」。</p>
<p>燙髮和穿高跟鞋。是一種摩登的裝束。我從來沒有到過山西省。太原這地方。有沒有摩登女子，而那裏的摩登女子，又是不是也燙髮和穿高跟鞋，不大明白。但從「與良家婦女有所識別」一句話推想，太原的女子，卽使是摩登的也算在內，大約是沒有燙髮和穿高跟鞋的。故有人爲要使山西省純樸的風氣更加純樸起見，就呌妓女實行燙髮和穿高跟鞋，以免有魚目混珠之虞。</p>
<p>自然的，妓女不是良家婦女，而是非良家婦女。妓女旣是非良家婦女，裝束自不能不和良家婦女有別。那末太原妓女之實行一律燙髮和穿高跟鞋，倒是很有意義的。何況在燙髮和穿高跟鞋之外，還須佩上一個桃花章」。這又象徵着她們是一種野草閒花。</p>
<p>然而有人說，呌妓女燙髮和穿高跟鞋，這對於妓女只有好處，而沒有壞處。因爲妓女出賣的是肉體，裝束必須時髦，才會有人要。現在太原妓女個個燙髮和穿高跟鞋起來，這在引誘一班狂蜂浪蝶上，不無收多少「以廣招來」的效力</p>
<p>不過我的看法和這不同。現在太原的婦女，恐漸漸時髦起來，也有燙髮穿高跟皮鞋者，因此當局令妓女盡燙髮和穿高跟皮鞋，使良家婦女不敢再去燙髮再穿高跟皮鞋，假定良家婦女而再穿高跟皮鞋而燙髮者，卽爲妓女，這是禁止奢侈的絕妙方法也，然而眞正時髦的良家婦女决不怕有妓女嫌疑而不穿高跟皮鞋和燙髮。</p>
<h3>夜泊</h3>
<p>— 野菲</p>
<p>船纔過黃鶴門，天就下起雨來了；並且據舟子說，今晚恐怕還要發一次大風，那不是我們又要遭一次厄運了麽！每個人的心中像壓進了幾十斤重鉛，一顆心儘是往下沉，沉；望望天，天却在漸漸地暗下來了。如果在這暴風雨下繼續前進，那末非但今天依然達不到目的地，而且前途說不定還有許多危險：就是現在這樣任它駝着二十多個人。在這白浪滔滔的潮面上飄浮，也實在很可躭心的。</p>
<p>一隻不十分大的船，淌在偌大的湖面上，仿彿一片樹葉子載了幾十匹螞蟻在河裏飄，祇要一震動就有傾覆之虞；我們在這情況之下，每個人的臉上似乎都罩上了一層恐怖的色彩。但是雖急也是沒用。除了極力把動盪的心設法鎮靜下去，自己安慰自己之外，也只好將整個生命付之這隻民船了。</p>
<p>現在大家唯一的希望便是天馬上晴下來，要是不下雨沒有風，那末卽使開夜航船也是無妨的。</p>
<p>「船家怎麽辦呢？我們在這樣的風</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>雨裏，飄流在半湖中，身上又冷，肚子又餓，想法找一條小港裏去停泊一下吧！」大家都不約而同的，向船老大發急。</p>
<p>「這是天時，呌我有什麽法好想呢？你們不要急，且進了香山港再說」。船老太一手倚在舵牙上，一面呼着阜烟，很和氣的安慰着大家。</p>
<p>「這裏離開香山港還有多遠」？這是一個女人的聲音。</p>
<p>「快啦！」他說着用一支旱姻管向　頭門裏指通去，固然有一堆黑越越的影子，漸漸地在朝船頭上移過來。「那個山影就是香山港了」。</p>
<p>二十多個人踡伏在油布篷底下，船身是像跑馬般的在激浪裏顛簸，雨點子打在篷布上面，發出克克克的聲音；乘客中有幾個吸姻的，拚命用香姻來解除這苦悶，姻霧彌漫在篷子裏，使許多人都刺激得咳嗆不休，有三位女太太却因爲不堪船身的顛簸，所以已伏在船舷上嘔吐了。</p>
<p>船慢慢地在雨中航行，四遭全給黑夜之神來統治着了；然而這時周圍的湖面上，除了我們的船以外，却找不出第二條船來。篷上的雨聲和船底的水花聲正在很和諧的伴奏着，船中每一個人的情緒却全浸沉在苦悶和煩躁裏面，彼此祇凝視着這　半明不暗的桅燈發怔。燈光反射在各人的臉上，大家都一樣的蒼白而無神，在每一雙眼睛却全在放着懊惱的光。</p>
<p>在黃昏，船總算　進了香山港裏，於是就在一株大楊樹下　了纜，準備在這裏躲一夜了。</p>
<p>各人心中已覺得輕鬆了許多，但一天沒有裝過東西的肚子却不由自主地搗起亂來，我終於禁不住的向船家交涉，　他們去想法些東西來充充饑才好。</p>
<p>「船老大，我們今天一天沒有吃東西，此刻實在餓得慌了，可有什麽法子好想。」我向船家問。</p>
<p>「今天要呌船老板替我們端正夜飯，空了肚子過夜總是不行的，反正吃了飯大家出飯錢就是了。」衆人也這樣附和着。可是總因爲米不夠，人太多的原故，所以祇燒了兩鑊子粥，大家都餓極了，因此沒有菜，白粥也喝得下去，兩鑊子粥，只不多時侯就搶了個精光，有幾個還似沒有夠飽似的。</p>
<p>癟的肚子雖然總算裝滿，但是睡却又要發生問題了。在這長不及一丈，寬不過五尺的船面上，怎樣能夠容許得下二十多個人呢？並且大家都沒携帶舖蓋；雖說現在已是春末夏初的時候，可是到夜來仍舊是那末寒意襲人的，所以除了有幾個已呼呼打鼾甜然入睡外，大部份的人都跌坐着不曾闔過一回眼。</p>
<h3>花轎的誘惑</h3>
<p>— 亦菴</p>
<h3>生命像一盞孤燈</h3>
<p>— 程銓</p>
<p>生命像一盞孤燈，牠，祇是許多個連成一串，或者便是三三兩兩地，飄浮在一望無邊際的時間之巨流中，明滅着，閃霎着，又聚散着。光是微弱的，朦朧的——而有的時候，也許還有一兩顆刺目地放出強大的火光來的吧，可是在時間之巨流中，在整個的宇宙間，仔細地看起來，却也不過僅是像隕星那麽一閃吧啦；跟着這強頑的悲劇的一閃而來的，還是那難以避免的粉碎與死滅，而留在這時間之巨流中的，也僅僅是一堆沒有用處的灰燼吧了。假如有一個日子宇宙間起了狂風，時間之流中有着一二個一甚至是極　弱的波浪吧，到那時，誰有勇氣敢担保那些死滅了的灰燼不會被沈掩到大川的底層——無窮盡深的底層中去呢？</p>
<p>但是，這些被掩沒了的死滅的灰燼，僅僅在十分之一秒鐘以前，還曾用生命的幽光照澈過一二點灰塵，與甚至是千分之一方寸的狹小的空間的呢！像曠野裏的幽靈那樣地。</p>
<p>（難道你竟能承認，這悲劇是頂公平的嗎？）</p>
<p>可是，讓我們像植物學者觀察一小片子葉那麽地，且仔細地看一看吧：生命，卽使在世間的巨流中，微弱如一盞孤燈也好，然而對於繁殖在面上的生物，牠是依舊有着多動人的堅強的媚力啊！牠的光是暗淡的，然而郤祇有牠才可以說是眞正地懂得怎樣使人們耐着性子活下去的方法呢！牠用了微弱得僅僅可以照見一顆碎米的光亮，而且却永遠把這幽靈般的光亮放在人面前一寸的地方，不斷地在誇示着，引誘着；於是，讓人們迷觀地跟着走去，直到消盡了千百份之一秒的時間，與生命的幽光同時死滅了爲止，同時淹沈了爲止……！</p>
<p>說生命僅是一盞頂微弱的孤燈吧，但是對於整個的人類，牠却是一個頂深奧的謎呢。人們看着牠，正像一個天文學家用了不可靠的儀器觀察遠處的星球，當他給許多細密的條紋與紛雜的色米所驚奇的時候，也便是給難解的謎所迷惑的時侯了。誰曾記起過，那橫在星火之底部的暗淡了的金色，便是國去了好久的童年的嬉笑；而綠的靑春興紫的戀情，也還有誰更敢去翻動昔臼的影子呢？於是，存在在這幽微的孤光中的，最鮮朋而最難擦去的，便祇有暗紅色的苦難的陷阱，與黑沈沈的老年的　影了。</p>
<p>好像是無邊的垂久了，人在生命的孤燈下面向了不同的方向跳躍着，勞作着，建設着，忍受着，陳列在生活的道路上的景物一簇地行過去，人經過山川，也經過河澤，在泥坑中打滾，也在荊棘上攀爬，可是誰會放棄過生命的力，誰曾忘掉過生存的本能，而最後，也有誰曾仔細地去端詳過仲夏夜的一顆瞬息的隕星呢？</p>
<p>生命是像一盞微弱的孤燈，可是就讓我們學着去頌讚這縱然是微弱，但是却有着強大的媚力的孤燈吧；祇有牠，才能呌人懷着更熱切的好意活下去；祇有牠，才能把自己的微弱的幽光敗在我們前面一寸的地方，引誘着，誇耀着。我們是一步步地走着了，卽使最後在等着的是墳墓，是灰燼；卽使生命是在千份之一秒中閃霎的幽火；一切都任地去吧！生命，是時間之巨流中的一盞孤燈啊！</p>

<h3>大上海不日公映北極探險遇難記</h3>
<p>「北極探險遇到難記」，係記錄一九三四年蘇聯北極探險之史寶。當探險目俄出發後，各國報章騰載，咸認爲近代探險事上一大事。按全體探險隊一零四名，係乘破冰船「芝魯斯金」號出發，歷盡種種艱難險阻，不幸「芝魯斯金」中途爲浮冰壓破，探險隊員逃難冰上，漂流至兩閱月之久，卒賴蘇聯航空隊冒險救援，始獲生還。</p>
<p>本片即係隨同探險隊出發之著名攝影師沙伏伏蘭實地攝成者，故全片均屬眞情實景，實爲探險影片中所不可多覯者，談片業已决定於八日起，在本埠大上海大戲院公映，聞與該片同時開映者，尚有最近梅蘭芳赴俄演劇，與蘇聯國際電影展覽會兩新聞片云。</p>
<h3>徐來胡笳都墮落了</h3>
<p>沈西苓導演的「船家女」，描寫農村破產，以及社會經濟恐慌，使那些善良的靈魂，在不良的環境逼迫下，終於變成了壞人。徐來胡茄這兩眞的鄉姑，被人拐到城市裏來，而賣給了妓院只好做起妓女來了。當那些喝醉了的嫖客，舉起了滿杯的酒迷笑道：「姑娘！看大爺的面子喝一杯吧？」雖然她倆已經喝得飽醉了，但不得不苦笑着，接過杯了狂飲着。</p>
<p>當拍這個塲面的時候，沈西苓哭喪着面孔，到處請求別人揮教，據說自己的經騐不足。</p>
<h3>「自由神」中的關公與看護</h3>
<p>一間整潔的客廳裏面，淡紅色的燈光，　軟地塗在白色的紗窗上。由紗窗的縫隙中望過去，可以看到一問寫字問！同時也做診室用的。壁上掛上幾　人體的生理解剖圖。楊醫生　周伯動滿面紅光的在開麥拉下用心地做戲。他的臉上，因爲在化裝室裏塗上了一層火漆般的油彩，室上去好像京劇中的關公，可是在銀幕上却顯出一副幾經滄桑的顏色。</p>
<p>在診室的另一個角落裏，站着一位看護吳湄小姐，兩眼感情地逼視着楊醫生，吳湄，也是話劇界的一員健將，在擠滿了話劇人材的電通公司裏，她是受到異常的重視。咋晚的一個塲面，許多觀衆都驚異她的演技，以五處女聞名的電通，又添一處女了。</p>
<h3>黎莉莉演唱京戲</h3>
<p>黎莉莉是歌舞能手，是銀幕明星，已是婦孺皆知，然而她會演京戲，大概還沒有人曉得。當聯華開拍「秋扇明燈」法庭內景時，她扮的是律師，穿着那寬袍大袖的律師制服一搖三擺地踱着已經有演京戲的台型，受了各人的慫恿來一段繫鼓罵曹，居然聲容并茂，采聲四起，連尊嚴的法官也聽得得意忘形，幾乎從公座上翻下來咧。</p>

<p>這幾年來。美國汽車市塲上最大的變遷。就是輕車的勃興和重車的衰落。在從前。重車的銷路差不多佔着汽車總數的百分之八十。這種暢銷的主要原因。大概是因爲一般工程師對於重車的設計。特別來得精密。重車的車身。多麼的堅固和流綫化。同時牠們內部的裝飾。是多麼的富麗。反觀那個時候的輕車。眞是相形見拙了。</p>
<p>的確重車的設計。因爲質量大的緣故。重心的分布問題。比較的容易解决。計劃時祗要稍微留意一點。就能够得到適當的重量和體積比例。使車身行駛時非常穩固。絕對不發生任何影響。</p>
<p>但是在輕車上。情形就不同了。重心的分配。最感困難。每每一輛輕車設計時很好。但是實地行駛起來。經過了猛烈的加速率作用。每每會發生傾覆的危險。美國過去長途競車賽中。爲了輕車傾覆而殞命的駕駛員。比比皆是。這種輕車過去的失敗。實在是很値得研究的。</p>
<p>工稈師經過了種種失敗。已漸漸的研究出牠們癥結的所在。新式的輕車。已把重心儘量的減低。同時車身下沉。踏板離地面很近，這是近年來輕車實際設計上的最大成功。</p>
<p>這幾年來各國都市因爲人口的繁殖。空間的體積問題。已漸趨嚴重。龐大的重車。行駛在交通複雜的通衢。不但耗費地位。幷且凋轉不靈。這是近年來輕車勃興的主要原因。</p>
<p>一般車主採用輕車後所得的經濟。有很大的滿意。第一輕車的行動靈活。第二日常的視察很簡單且便利。第三遇有故障發生。輕車能够很快的修理而恢復原狀。這一切的一切。都給車主以深刻的印象。</p>
<p>去年福特廠八匹至十匹馬力的輕車。銷數竟達百分之六十八。這種輕車構造的完備。的確値得贊美。車頂已採用全鋼。極度的流綫化這在過去的輕車上。已屬少見。幷且速率的變更。有五個的步驟。掣動的迅速。加速齒輪動作的敏捷。尤其餘事。</p>
<p>馬律司去年輕車的暢銷。亦堪驚人。重車僅銷百分之三十。喜臨門小寳寳車的傾銷。已風行一時。據應用者宣種。採用輕車時平均每哩的汽油和修理費用。要比應用重車時减去百分之二十五。普通工程上的習慣。引擎愈大。則能力捎失愈少。而今輕車的小引擎倒來得經濟。這實在是最奇怪的一個問題。</p>
<p>現在美國各都市的通衢內。大部分的汽車都是在十匹至十五匹馬力之間。其次是十五匹至二十匹馬力。最少的要算二十五匹馬力以上的車輛了。公路上行駛的。差不多完委是十匹至二十匹馬力的輕車。這種新的趨勢。實在是從前所未嘗見的。</p>
<p>在從前。一般車主不信任輕車的另原因。就是速率的低微。因爲輕車的引擎很小。汽缸體積有限。壓縮比率很小。結果引擎的能力减少。很高的速率就不能够得到。但現在已不成問題。引擎雖小。壓縮比例卻大大的增高。同時再採用配合極佳的齒輪。速率的增加。不知凡幾。現在且把這幾年來輕車速率的增加。列表如下。</p>
<p>年份馬力最高速率（每句鐘英里數）</p>
<p>一九二九　十匹　五〇</p>
<p>一九三〇　十匹　八〇</p>
<p>一九三一　十匹　九〇</p>
<p>一九三二　十匹　九五</p>
<p>一九三三　十匹　一〇五</p>
<p>一九三四　十匹　一五〇</p>
<p>一九三五　十匹　二〇〇</p>
<p>由上表。可知近年來輕車速率的遞增。因爲速率的高超。汽缸的構造也儘量的改進。汽缸的金屬。現在已採用特製的合金。質硬而抗拒酸性。散熱器的優良。爲一般重車所不及。</p>
<p>美國各車廠今年來對於輕車製造之狂熱。殆已不成問題。處目前狀况而論。重車雖然未被輕車完全排棄。但是將來的汽車市塲。將完全屬於輕車。殆無疑義的啊。</p>
<h3>奧斯摩別爾新車</h3>
<p>— 敷</p>
<p>—膝關動作輪及其他特色—</p>
<p>膝關動作輪。爲歷來關於汽車乘坐舒適方面之最大貢獻。此蓋由千萬車主年來所親歷之經騐證明之者。奧斯摩別爾汽車工程師。旣於一九三四年度。由千萬輛奧斯摩別爾汽車。證實膝關動作之效用。爰决繼續應用於一九三五年所出之每輛奧斯摩別爾。籍使其成爲標準特色。而售價則不另增加。</p>
<p>嘗考奧斯摩別爾。所以因膝關動作之應用。而益臻舒適者。蓋其前輪可各自單獨上下。而不復相互牽制。向經前軸而傳播。以徧及於全車其餘各部之撞碰顚震。膝關動作輪今可使其消滅於無形。如行經涸轍或突遭這碰。則該前輪之螺絲彈簧。自能吸受顚震。而不復傳至車上或乘客。至於輪之對準程度。且因而益臻準正。於是胎之壽命。亦因而彌永。</p>
<p>尤足稱者。膝關動作亦且大有裨於安全。蓋此種前輪之應用。使中央管理轉向成爲可能。故每逢緊要關頭。自然得心應手。彌便操縱。再爲關心安全起見。一九三五式奧斯摩別爾新車。且皆裝有改良盡善之自行接力加大超等水壓塞車。其制動面積。增加百分之十四。動作敏妙凖正。運用靈便無比。</p>
<p>奧斯摩別爾六缸與八缸新車之又一優點。厥爲隔絕聲音。其車身底盤與引擎。完全採用合乎科學原理之不透聲音方法。如飛顯整幅堅實鋼頂。以及車門鑲板等處。概用特優絕緣體。藉使一切聲浪。絕對不致侵入。此外如完全無聲之諧動變速機。三點橡皮墊承引擎托架。以及特別設計之减聲器等。種種特色。奧斯摩別爾。兼而有之。此其所以爲唯一安靜無聲之優美汽車也。</p>
<h3>辣斐又一批新車展覽</h3>
<p>— 篔</p>
<p>納喜汽車廠出品又一批辣斐新車。茲已到申。本埠經售商赫金公司。卽將於本星期杪。陳列樣子間。以供衆覽。此項新車。售價屬於最低價類。但其七粒軸承拐軸。與十八匹馬力引擎。以及其餘三十九種精優特色。則爲辣斐所獨有。若其餘低價車輛。决無兼備之者。赫金營業部經理格林白氏語人曰。此項新車。實已以納喜引擎之一切優點。貢獻於一般新車主。按以若斯之低價。如在昔日。决難製成如此盡美盡善之汽車。今以廠方出產方法之進步。原料市塲交易之相巧。以及其餘種種關係。始能成此空前傑搆。新車引擎採用五點橡皮墊承。故其動作旣無響聲。且不致發生顚震。完全壓力潤滑。以壓力加油於活塞梢與汽缸壁。凡此均爲大汽車之特色。而竟於若斯低價之汽車見之者。新車全部長廣一八九寸半。極寬長舒適之至。四門轎車。自屏風至後窗。其內部長度八十六寸。新車之又一特色。卽新式通風是也。不論何種天氣。均可享受極安靜之通風。旣無碍於乘客之視綫。且無風陣侵襲之虞。新車以如此低價。而有如許優點。故一經問世。必為一般人所熱烈歡迎。此蓋可斷言也。</p>
<h3>汽車零訊一束</h3>
<p>— 虞</p>
<p>汽車和女人的係　英國納菲勛爵最近在牛津演講。他對於婦女駕駛汽車。表示推崇。他不承認她們是予人以憂脅的。他們和男子駕駛汽車者。實在不相上下。納菲說。「如果你們以爲婦女汽車駕駛人中間。有不少的是神經質的。這個我可以同意。不過你們倘若說她們都是惡劣的。那末我是完全不同意的」納菲勛爵繼續說。駛用汽車的人們。對於女人。有許多地方應該表示謝意。因爲她們對於目前汽車的進展。有很大的帮助。這是爲向來人所忽視的。所有汽車的顏色·車廂裝飾·零附件·駕駛的便易和車身式樣等。可以說無一而不受她們的影響的。關於英國馬律斯車廠的活動力。納菲也曾講及。他說馬律斯出品達到每分鐘一具車的時候。已經不遠了云。</p>
<p>德國汽車產量增加一九三四年的時候。德國共總製造汽車一三〇，〇〇〇輛。這個數目。較之一九三三年增加了百分之五十八。可是對於政府所冀希的數額。還沒有到達哩。自從馬力稅取銷之後。一九三三年的德國汽車產量。增加已達一倍。不過去年的秋天。節季上的需要衰落。爲向來所未有的。雖然生產量並不充分上增。可是大衆的需要還在續進中。這是可以從兩點來看。一是一九三四年的國內產量較前年加增百分之五十八。一是在德國銷售的外國汽車。銷路增加至百分之七十三。至於德國汽車生產量之所以跌落。其最大原因是在原料的缺乏。</p>
<p>美車產量續有增進一九三四年二月份。美國的汽車產量平均每星期達六萬五千輛。今年二月份產額已逾每星期八〇，〇〇〇輛之數。所以預計本年第一季的三個月。美國汽車和運貨汽車的產量將逾一，〇〇〇，〇〇〇之數。一年以前。第一季的三個月汽車產量爲七五〇，〇〇〇輛。一九三〇年以來。每年第一季的汽車產量。雖然增進遲緩而常在增進之中。一九三四年的第一季汽車生產量。若然和一九三三年同時期相比較。那末更能顯出他的增進了。因爲一九三三年的首季。各牌汽車的產量總數不過三六八，二六五輛。關於汽車實業前途的光景如何。我們可從五家大公司中的三公司——司蒂倍克。批士亞羅。惠廉士——恢復活動而測定。這三家大廠從前因爲受着不景氣的影饗。曾經一度停滯。其中司蒂倍克一家法院已認可其改組的計劃。其他的兩家也在進行計議之中。將來生產量的增加。都是可以預卜的哩。</p>
<h3>談化油系之熱的供給（續）</h3>
<p>— 鷺</p>
<p>現代高貴的汽車。爲求汽油圓滿的蒸發起見。其標準的方法。是將汽油與空氣的混合料未入汽缸之前。使之與被排氣所熱的體面（Suface）接觸而加熱之。假使未入化油機本身的空氣。先在被排氣所熱的體面的周圍低速度的經過。藉此溫熱。則汽油當然也更易蒸發。這種情形之下。在實用上。熱的體面就在排氣管的外面。此外。還有個方法。就是在化油機浮筒的蓋上。裝一個氣套。使從汽缸中被排出來熱的廢氣。一部份經過此氣套以熱浮筒室內的汽油。以上所述幾種利用排氣未加熱的方法。較之裝水套利用冷却系裏水來加熱。實一極大的改進。因爲在此種方法運用之下。加熱供給的熱度很高。但爲求汽油蒸發最佳的結果計。還得用以下的方法來補不足之處。就是用排氣套的進氣管。或借熱的進氣管。再或聯合式排氣進氣館。總之。假使要想使用尋常商業汽油更求經濟的話。在今日的化油機上。必連帶着加熱的設備。（此種設備特指加熱氣管而言。）</p>
<p>有許多舊時的汽車。在製造的時候。因爲那時汽油品質好。所以化油系的工作很使人滿意。但是到現在。汽油的經濟與發動機的工作—尢其是在發動樓尙未全熱以前—已令這種車子的司機人或車主覺得非常不滿意了。在這種舊式的許多車子要。化油系可以使之現代化。而且所費也不多。如果在市面上可以購到現成的話。祇須換裝一個聯合式排氣進氣管。或者將原來的進氣管裝以排氣套也可以。還有一種方法。所得的効果也是一樣。就是將未入化油機的空氣。經過相當的裝置。先行加熱。不過。對於舊式的汽車化油系如何使之現代化。可沒有一般的定律可言。須按照每一輛車子的特殊情形而定奪。就一般而論。大凡在進氣管不裝在外面的發動機裏。能使化油系現代化的地方很少了。所可以着手的。不過裝個加熱未入化油機的空氣的設備。或則換個現成有水套或排氣套的化油機而已。</p>
<p>我們知道。加熱空氣或混合料。是要使這空氣或混合料澎漲而變輕。我們也知道。這加熱後的空氣或混合料。較之冷的空氣或混合料於同樣的發動機或喉門開張之下。被吸入汽缸裏的重量要輕得多。這一層。照學理上說來。會减弱爆炸時所加於活塞的壓力。但是實際上。加熱後的混合料所生的爆炸壓力。與未加熱的混合料所生的爆炸壓力比較。相差極微。幾於實用上無重要的意義？除非設計一種爲特別任務的發動機。譬如說像競賽汽車。計及於此。不僅如此。用未加熱之混合料。非但是燃料</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>不經濟。並且發動機的工作—或許在盛暑的天氣時例外—也十分不均。</p>
<p>從前差不多各種美國製造的汽車。都裝着化油機爐（Carbureter　Stove）。用以加熱進化油機的空氣。這種裝置。直到有了改良的氣管以後。才成不需要。下圖所示。卽係此類化油機爐的一種。茲略述其工作原理於下。（甲乙二圖的同樣部份以同樣字母表明之）環繞排氣管A外面的是個鐵筒B。鐵筒的內徑比排氣管的外徑須大出若于。鐵筒因筒腳C的支持和排氣管並不接觸。而離開有相當的空隙。D是根管子。一頭接着筒C。另一頭接述化油機的空氣入道。當發動機在吸氣行程的時候。外界的空氣卽從入口E進至鐵筒內。再由管子d通入化油機。因爲筒是圍在排氣管的外面。所以空氣經過的時候。就爲之溫熱。此溫熱的空氣進入化油機後。卽令已噴爲霧狀的汽油油更易蒸發。有幾種車子。化油機爐並不另行裝置。直接和排氣鑄成整個的一組。至於接連化油機爐與化油機空氣入道的管子。尋常都以專供此用的可彎曲的鋼管任之。遝有其他的化油機爐。形式上雖有不同。工作原理則都是一樣的。</p>
<p>爲免除利用排氣經過排氣管供給化油系加熱有不足或過度起見。無論什麽車子。都裝有管理的機關。最簡單而最普通的。就是用一個蝶形氣門。這個蝶形氣門的位置。卽在連接排氣管與排氣套的管子裏。運用時可由司機人在車前板（卽錶板）上經過相當的機械作用而管理之。這種裝置很是普遍。無論是聯合式排氣進氣管或者是借熱進氣管的加熱方法都有。</p>
<p>總之。爲求燃料經濟。與發動機工作完美。化油系需熱之供給。已毫無異議的肯定了。而以往汽車家努力的功績。固然已使汽車的服務愈臻完善。但將來的改進。也眞前無北境。讀我們來等待着吧。</p>

However, there were changes in the defense area of the Luan and Yu districts. Both sides had already agreed that at noon on the 7th, Yi Wo and Da Mu would go to the Japanese barracks in Haiguang Temple to report to Commander Umezu on the progress of the meeting between the two sides in Hebei Province. Yin Rugeng and Tao Shangming planned to meet with Yi Wo, Gao Qiao, Da Mu, Tanaka and others in Tianjin again on the night of the 7th for a final discussion, and then separately leave Tianjin to return to Ping and Tang, to prepare for the eastward passage of the new special police force. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the night of the 6th, at around 9:00 PM, the Chinese and Japanese personnel responsible for negotiations met in Room 10 of the Tokiwa Inn in the Japanese Concession. The Japanese participants were Da Mu, the two staff officers Do Kyo and Tanaka, Consul Tanaka, Yi Wo, head of the special affairs agency, and Gao Qiao, military attaché. The Chinese side was represented by Tao Shangming and Yin Rugeng. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Hebei Province has stipulated that each of the more than 500 soldiers remaining after the reorganization of Li Yun's Security Supplementary Team in the Yanjiao Xiadian war zone will be given ten yuan for repatriation. Those who have guns will have them purchased back at a price to prevent them from falling into the hands of bandits. Li Yupeng, staff officer of the 51st Army, and Li Yun are supervising the reorganization and repatriation. It is expected to be completed within a week. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the rotation of the security team in the war zone, the representatives of both sides met in Tianjin last night, and the result was satisfactory. Yi Wo, Da Mu, and Gao Qiao had a meeting at the Japanese garrison headquarters in Tianjin this morning. They will meet with our representatives again in the afternoon to make a final decision. Yin Rugeng, Tao Shangming, Zhu Shiqin, and others will take the same car to Beiping to report the results of the meeting to the authorities. As for the date of the security team's rotation, it is generally speculated that it will begin on the 10th of this month, which is almost certain. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tongxian) A telegram from Tongxian says that Li Yupeng, representative of the Hebei Provincial Government, You Shijie from the Ji-Mi District Office, and Li Yun, head of the Special Affairs Corps, took a car to Yanjiao Town this morning to begin reorganizing Sun Peilin's First Battalion. They are scheduled to return to Tongxian that evening. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Qingyu and Zhang Yantian, the newly appointed commanders of the security team, and the commanders of the old security team in the war zone, including Yang Yucheng, have all been summoned to Tianjin from their defensive positions. At 2:00 PM on the 7th, they went to the provincial government to discuss the rotation. It is reported that Yang's troops will be transferred to Junliangcheng and incorporated into Li Zhentang's division for training. Zhou Yuying's troops will be transferred out after the bandits in Yutian are eliminated. (7th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) After the date for the rotation of the newly formed war zone security team was agreed upon, related parties are actively preparing. Tao Shangming told reporters on the 7th that the date of departure was originally set for the 10th. If it cannot be completed in time, it may be delayed by a day or two. He will return to Tangshan on the morning of the 8th and come to Tianjin after the rotation is completed to report to the provincial government. (7th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Five Banners of Suiyuan Request to be Reassigned to Chahar Province; The Twelve Banners of Chahar Request to be Reorganized into a League</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The residents of the Twelve Banners of Chahar have twice petitioned the central government's relevant departments to be reorganized into a league. The central government believes that county governments have been established in these banners for many years, and their administrative efficiency is relatively complete. Therefore, the residents' request for reorganization into a league has been rejected. Currently, the residents of the Twelve Banners are still continuing to request. The Five Banners of Suiyuan are requesting to be assigned to Chahar. The residents of these banners are willing to sell their land to the Suiyuan Provincial Government at a price. The matter is currently being negotiated between Chahar and Suiyuan. Fu Zuoyi, chairman of the Suiyuan Provincial Government, previously visited Song Zheyuan to discuss the matter. The five banners were originally under the jurisdiction of Chahar Province. Previously, because Yan Xishan transferred more than a dozen counties, including Xuanhua in Hebei Province, to Chahar Province, the banners were also transferred to Suiyuan. The residents of the banners believe that although the land belongs to Suiyuan, their personal relationships with the banners in Chahar Province are frequent. Recently, they requested to be reassigned to Chahar. After He Yingqin returned to Beiping from Tianjin last night, Song Zheyuan and Fu Zuoyi paid visits this morning to report on the matter. Song will personally escort his mother back to Tianjin the day after tomorrow, and then accompany Qin Dechun and Xiao Zhenying back to Zhangjiakou. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhao Chengyi, representative of the Twelve Banners of Chahar, arrived in Beijing and said that the commissioner of the Twelve Banners of Chahar, in order to facilitate contact with the central government, sent him as a representative stationed in Beijing to facilitate close contact. The Twelve Banners of Chahar have more than 200,000 Mongolian residents, and the land area is 1,500 li in length and width. The area is vast, and there is a need to change the banners into a league. The special officials of the Twelve Banners jointly submitted a request to the central government, but it was not approved. After the current session of the Mongolian Political Council is completed, they will send representatives to Beijing to petition and seek to achieve the goal of reorganization into a league.

<h3>The Xiamen Currency Fell Sharply; Most Banks Suspended Cash Redemption; The Municipal Government Issued a Notice Strictly Prohibiting Manipulation</h3>
<p>(Xiamen) On the 6th and 7th, cash transactions in the city were almost non-existent. On the 7th, the currency rebounded slightly, using prices ranging from 11.678 to 11.878, which was extremely chaotic. As the currency depreciated, all banks except the Bank of Communications temporarily suspended cash redemption. Those who took it to redeem could only exchange it for banknotes from other banks, such as the Bank of China paying with Zhongnan banknotes, and Zhongnan exchanging for Shiye banknotes. Only the Bank of Communications normally redeemed, but there were very few banknotes. As a result, the amount of silver dollars in the market decreased sharply, banknotes depreciated, and small foreign coins rose. As for the reason for the suspension of redemption, it was to prevent smuggling. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) The municipal government issued a notice on the 7th that recently, money changers and merchants have been buying silver and manipulating market prices, resulting in a difference of one or two dimes between the current silver dollar and the banknotes. In addition to the Public Security Bureau and the Chamber of Commerce taking measures, in the future, the current silver dollar and banknotes will be at par. Anyone who deliberately raises or lowers the price will be strictly arrested and prosecuted. The Chamber of Commerce, upon the order of the municipal government, will hold a general meeting on the 9th to provide relief.

<h3>Residual Bandits Between Guangshi and Ningjian Have Lost Contact; Wei Jianlong's Bandits Were Completely Eliminated; The Provincial Government Rewarded the Brigade with One Thousand Yuan</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou) Lu Xingrong telegraphed that Li Huirong, the leader of the pseudo-Guangchang Guerrilla Team, led 32 bandits with 20 weapons to surrender to Zhang's regiment in Anyuan. According to the confession, the remaining bandits between Guangshi and Ningjian have lost contact with the pseudo-military region and plan to flee to Jiangle to seek a way out. It is found that the Han brigade stationed in Jiang has been blocked and suppressed as necessary, and the bandits will never succeed. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) Wei Jianlong's bandits, who had been disrupting the banks of the Minjiang River, were severely suppressed by Liu's brigade of the 87th Division, leaving only a hundred or so people. They fled to Gutian and were chased by Li's camp of the brigade. They were completely wiped out near Dakeng in Gutian. Wei was killed on the spot. The provincial government specially rewarded the brigade with one thousand yuan on the 7th to encourage them. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Balance of China's International Trade</h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>Since the early years of the Tongzhi reign in the late Qing Dynasty, China's international trade has been in deficit every year. Fortunately, the income from other overseas items has been able to offset the deficit somewhat. Therefore, in the past, except for a few people, few people paid attention to the frightening increase in this deficit. Until last year, when silver prices soared and silver flowed out, the whole country was panicked, as if China's economy was in dire straits. Only then did it begin. In fact, the outflow of silver was caused by the trade deficits of previous years. It was found that the silver declared for export last year totaled 260 million yuan, of which more than 90 percent flowed out from foreign banks. The reason why foreign banks can have such a huge amount of silver for outflow is that in recent years, all parts of the country have to pay for imported goods. That is, the deficit funds are temporarily stored in the vaults of foreign banks.</p>
<p>Having been stimulated by this, the Chinese people gradually feel that the situation of China's international trade should be improved. Therefore, they tried every means to reduce the deficit. The three ministries of Industry, Finance, and Foreign Affairs even focused on the study of international trade balance yesterday (the 6th) to discuss. It has been decided that the fundamental way to solve the problem is to vigorously cultivate domestic production in order to achieve self-sufficiency and to pay attention to overseas markets in order to promote exports. It is also planned that various relevant departments will jointly form an international trade committee to research and implement the plan. This shows that the government's efforts to reduce the deficit have a positive trend.</p>
<p>The major reasons for the increase in China's trade deficit are fourfold. First, China's production is backward, and products cannot meet the needs of the general public. Second, the tariff rate is too low, which allows foreign goods to be sold cheaply. Third, most of China's import trade is directly operated by foreign merchants, which makes the Chinese people only passive sellers. Fourth, exports have decreased, which relatively leads to an increase in the deficit. Therefore, if we want to reduce the deficit today, cultivating domestic production and paying attention to overseas markets are indeed important measures. However, the gradual increase of tariffs and the operation of trade by the Chinese people themselves are also fundamental strategies that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Not only that, but also the so-called cultivation of production, the so-called development of overseas markets, the so-called increase of tariffs, and the so-called self-management of trade all require the unity of politics as a driving force. The cultivation of production must seek its development in many aspects, and especially must have a unified national organization to prevent it from falling into contradictions and infighting, so that it can have a clear effect. Judging from China's past situation, there is no considerable connection between provinces. Often, the same commodity is being taxed in Province A, while Province B immediately exempts it from tax. Or the same product is being promoted in Province A, while Province B is also manufacturing it at the same time. Provinces that do not manufacture are also not manufactured in Province B. It can be known how difficult it is to adjust international trade and cultivate domestic industries in this way.</p>
<p>Today, China's international trade urgently needs to seek its balance, and the entire economy urgently needs to seek its independence. However, in this urgency, it seems that we still cannot help but adopt a calm attitude, first study the most fundamental and concrete strategies, and then devote our full efforts to them. If the top and bottom can work together to seek the root cause, the emergence of "New China" is promising.</p>

<h3>Three Phases of Japanese Expansion Abroad: Minister to Visit Manchuria for Inspection</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of the Army, Hayashi, gave a talk on the afternoon of the 7th regarding the requests for meetings from the National Unity Committee and other situations, as follows: "Regarding the request for a meeting, there is no issue in a private capacity. However, concerning national defense and Manchurian issues, it would be best to exchange opinions after returning from Manchuria. Therefore, I have instructed them to respond accordingly. However, if they wish to meet before my departure, I do not think it is necessary. Today, in the Cabinet meeting, all my fellow ministers agreed to my visit to Manchuria. Approximately after my return, the Minister of Colonial Affairs and the Foreign Minister will also visit Manchuria for inspection in turn. It is considered necessary for cabinet members to visit Manchuria in person for on-site inspection, and my colleagues all agree. Now that this has been proposed, to deepen understanding, I feel that this is an excellent move. I also believe it is appropriate," and so on. (Jiji News Agency, 7th)</p>
<h3>Buckingham Palace: British Monarch's Broadcast Speech Recalls the Past, Cares About People's Hardships, and Hopes for Unity and Trust Between Upper and Lower Classes</h3>
<p>(London) At 8 PM tonight, the British Monarch delivered a broadcast speech at Buckingham Palace, which was transmitted by various radio stations and agencies to all parts of the world.

My feelings cannot be expressed in words. I can only say that the Queen and I sincerely thank you all. Looking back, I am grateful to Heaven that my people and I have gone through so much hardship together. However, these difficulties have not yet passed. Many are still unemployed, which saddens me. I am thinking of ways to help them. The disabled should also be helped. Furthermore, there are many things that worry me. However, I feel that with God's help, if we can face these difficulties with trust, courage, and unity, then these difficulties can be overcome. Therefore, I have full trust and hope for the future."

Finally, the British Monarch expressed gratitude for the congratulatory messages from all parties. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3>Celebrating the Anniversary of the British Monarch's Accession to the Throne: London Stays Up All Night; Lights and Electric Torches Light Up the Sky; The People Sing, Dance, and Revel Until Dawn; The Prime Minister Takes to the Skies to View the Spectacular Scene</h3>
<p>(London) The scene in London last night was unprecedented since the European armistice. The revelry in the West End continued until dawn. People in the streets sang or cheered, sometimes hugging the police, sometimes jumping onto the steps of passing cars. At 3 AM this morning, Piccadilly was blocked at both ends, with no fewer than two thousand cars stopped. Around Nelson's Column at Trafalgar Square, several couples were dancing for joy. The joyous scenes everywhere cannot be fully described. At 1 AM this morning, there were still crowds gathered in front of Buckingham Palace, even though the palace lights had been turned off early. Many others went to the British War Memorial this morning to respectfully present wreaths. Prime Minister MacDonald took off from Croydon Airport at 12:15 AM this morning and circled the entire city and suburbs for one hour and twenty minutes.

<p>(London) From the smallest island to the largest dominion, and the British communities in major foreign cities, today warmly celebrate the silver jubilee of the British Monarch's accession to the throne. Tonight, the streets of London's West End are teeming with people, parading to see the lights. The scale of the lights reaching up to the clouds is unprecedented. Crowds also gathered in front of Buckingham Palace. When the British Monarch and Queen appeared on the brilliantly lit balcony, cheers resounded like thunder. The Monarch and Queen stayed on the balcony for twelve minutes, waving to the crowd with smiles. The people shouted "Long live the King and Queen!" Some waved handkerchiefs, some waved flags, and some threw hats into the air, finally singing the national anthem and dispersing. At 11 PM, the British Monarch lit a small electric torch in Luton, and at the same time, celebration bonfires throughout the British Isles were lit, totaling over two thousand. No accidents occurred during the celebration. It is reported that this morning, when the British Monarch and others went to St. Paul's Cathedral, a total of seven thousand people fainted along the way and were given first aid by medical teams.

<h3>Dominion Representatives Gather on Downing Street to Discuss the Current International Situation with British Cabinet Members; Both National Defense and Economic Issues Are Involved</h3>

It is reported that further meetings will be held this week. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) Overseas representatives, gathered in London to celebrate the 25th anniversary of King George V's accession to the throne, held a meeting with British Cabinet members the other day to discuss the European situation. From today, they will resume their meetings to discuss imperial defense and economic issues. According to press reports, at today's meeting, representatives of the various Dominions raised a number of questions regarding the Far East, which Foreign Secretary Simon answered one by one, to the satisfaction of all parties. It is noted that this meeting does not decide British international policy, but only provides explanations to the representatives of the various Dominions, so that the British government still has the freedom to decide international policy. At today's meeting, what the overseas Dominions are most concerned about is the issue of British-Japanese relations. There are currently two major issues in British-Japanese relations: one is the competition from Japanese cotton textiles, and the other is the threat of Japanese naval expansion. Will Britain continue to be friendly with Japan, regardless of these issues? This is what should be discussed at the meeting. It is reported that the results of the discussion are that the first issue can be resolved if the Dominions can cooperate with the mother country. The second issue is related to the United States. The British government has reportedly assured the Canadian representative that Britain will not resolve this issue alone without the participation of the United States. From the British government's recent attitude towards Japan's promulgation of the Petroleum Law, which hinders the business of foreign merchants, we know that Britain is treating Japan in good faith.

<h3>Canada Restricts Imports of Japanese Goods; Japanese Foreign Ministry Considers Countermeasures</h3>

<h3>Germany Plans to Approach Britain and Strengthen the Guarantee of the Locarno Treaty; This Will Be the Main Goal of Its Future Diplomacy</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The German Foreign Ministry is now trying to approach Britain and wants to strengthen the guarantee of the Locarno Treaty. German Head of State Hitler sent a telegram of congratulations on the occasion of King George V's accession jubilee, in which he praised Britain's aspiration for peace. This is noteworthy. It is generally believed that Germany's pro-British attitude is clearly due to the reaction to the Franco-Russian mutual assistance treaty, which makes Germany uneasy. The German Foreign Ministry seems to be asking Britain for a detailed explanation of the Franco-Russian mutual assistance treaty and declaring that maintaining the Locarno Treaty is the main goal of German diplomacy. However, because Italy is busy with its colonies and fears that it cannot fully fulfill its obligations under the Locarno Treaty, it is using this as a reason to demand an increase in the guarantee of the Locarno Treaty. In addition, the German Foreign Ministry will ask France and Italy for a detailed explanation of the Franco-Russian mutual assistance treaty. Furthermore, the German Parliament was originally scheduled to convene on May 9, but has now been postponed to May 15 due to the King's accession anniversary. At that time, Hitler will deliver an important speech explaining German foreign policy. Hitler is now discussing German foreign policy with the newly built Scharnhorst large postal ship, the Minister of Defense, Blomberg, the Minister of Economic Affairs, Schacht, the disarmament representative, Ribbentrop, the party representative, Hess, and the Minister of Propaganda, Goebbels.

<h3>The Economic Influence of Soviet Russia in Northern Manchuria Declines Sharply; The Result of the Sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>Osaka: According to a telegram from Harbin received by the Osaka City Industrial Department, with the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway, the entire Soviet influence has begun to retreat. As for the Soviet economic organizations in Harbin, only the Trade Representative Office and the Far Eastern Bank Turg Star and a few other places remain. It is learned that the above-mentioned places are gradually closing down due to various circumstances. The reasons are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Petroleum companies simultaneously announced their abolition due to the enactment of the Petroleum Monopoly Law by "Manchukuo." (2) The Pito firm attached to the Trade Representative Office has been reorganized and is liquidating its remaining goods and closing its doors. The Food Export Department has also completed its reorganization and has recently been abolished.</p>
<p>(3) The Trade Representative Office is scheduled to decide whether to retain or abolish it in two or three months. If the "Man" Soviet trade relationship can still be developed, it may be possible to reactivate it with special trade preferences. However, according to the current situation, the Soviet Union has no new commodities to import. (4) The Turg Fruit is the Soviet exchange agency in Manchuria. There are still many people who remit money to their relatives and friends in their home country, or it may be able to continue to exist as necessary. (5) The Far Eastern Bank has reduced its scale since the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway. It is expected that it will be closed by September at the latest, after the railway bureau staff has completely withdrawn. (Jiji News Agency, 5th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Currency Plan to Be Broadcast on the Radio Next Monday; The Gold-for-Silver Proposal Is Not Being Considered</h3>

At the same time, the price of silver in New York remained unchanged at 73 cents per ounce. (Guomin News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>(New York) According to the expectations of major traders in the New York Stock Market, the U.S. government will raise the purchase price of newly produced silver in the coming days, but the market has no active activity and is taking a wait-and-see attitude. According to figures published by "Steel" magazine, the working rate of the steel industry is 44 percent, a decrease of two points from the previous week. The automotive industry has also decreased somewhat from the previous week, with only a slight increase in scattered transactions. (Denstu, 6th)</p>

<h3>Graduation Ceremony of the Red Army Officer School; Stalin Delivers an Important Speech; The Period of Technical Hunger Has Now Been Overcome; Continue to Advance Toward Industrialization and Collectivization</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Graduates of the Red Army Officer School gathered at the Kremlin on the 4th of this month. Stalin delivered a speech on the spot as follows:</p>
<p>"The legacy we inherited from the past was a technically backward, dilapidated, and impoverished country. Our country has experienced four years of the imperialist war and three years of civil war, so it has been almost completely destroyed. At that time, most of our people were illiterate, the level of technology was extremely low, and a few industries were like small islands in the ocean of agricultural farms. This is the legacy we inherited.</p>
<p>"Our task was to lead our country out of the track of the Middle Ages and ignorance and onto the track of modern industry and mechanized agriculture. This task was both heavy and difficult. The question at the time was as follows: Will we solve this problem in the shortest possible time and strengthen our country's socialism, or will we not solve this problem? In that case, our country will maintain its weak culture and ignorant culture, and will lose its independence and turn into a sacrifice of the imperialist powers. "At that time, our country went through a period of extreme lack of technology. Industry lacked machinery, and agriculture and transportation lacked machinery. At that time, we had no basic technical base, so there was no talk of industrialization. But we were finally able to move towards industrialization and collectivization with firm belief and enthusiasm. Today, this stage can be said to have been completed. Today, anyone can admit that we have made great achievements on this road. Today, anyone can admit that we have a strong and superior industrial organization, strong and mechanized agriculture, increasingly developed means of transportation, and a well-organized and well-equipped Red Army. All of this can show that we have largely overcome the period of technical hunger. "Although the period of technical hunger has passed, we have entered a new period in which all technical personnel should make further use of technology. Today, we have factories, collective and state-owned farms, and armies. We have all the technology, but our people do not have enough experience to make full use of this technology. Previously, we always said, "Technology determines everything." Today, our attention should be focused on the talents who can master technology. Therefore, the slogan "Technology determines everything" can only reflect the past period of technical hunger. As for today, it should be replaced by the slogan "Technical cadres determine everything." This is our main idea today. This slogan requires our country's leaders to give the greatest care and consideration to workers of all sizes in all aspects, to educate them, to assist them, to care for them, to encourage them if they have any requests, to supervise them if they have preliminary success, and so on."</p>
<p>Finally, Stalin raised a glass to congratulate the graduates of the military school and hoped that they would be successful in national defense organization and leadership. (TASS, 6th)</p>
<h3>End of the Italy-Austria-Hungary Conference; Obstacles to the Rome Conference Removed; Hungary Agrees Not to Raise Demands for Military Reorganization and Treaty Revision; Agreement Reached on the Danube River Convention to Facilitate</h3>
<p>Small Entente Foreign Ministers to Meet in Rome Next Tuesday</p>
<p>Venice—The foreign ministers of Italy, Hungary, and Austria held a conference here last Saturday and Sunday to discuss far-reaching European affairs. It concluded today. According to a press release, the three countries reached a consensus during the conference and paid special attention to the Torri del Lago talks to be held in Rome on May 20, in order to implement the Rome Protocol signed by France and Italy on January 7. The main provision of the Protocol is to guarantee Austria's independence with a Central European Convention, which will be discussed at the Rome talks. Participants include representatives from nine countries: France, Italy, Austria, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>Venice—The Torri del Lago Conference will be held next month in Rome. The preparatory meeting of representatives from Italy, Austria, and Hungary concluded this afternoon. An official statement said that the negotiations were conducted in an atmosphere of amity and cooperation, and that all key points had been resolved and the goals of the three governments were fully aligned. Political circles here indicated that future developments will be determined by other countries, especially the Little Entente. Representatives of the Little Entente countries will convene a preliminary meeting in the Romanian capital on May 14 to discuss the Danube River issue. According to reliable sources, the Hungarian demands for military equality and antagonism towards the Little Entente are major obstacles to the ultimate success of the Rome Conference. Hungary has now agreed to participate in the Torri del Lago Conference, but reserves the right to refuse to sign the Torri del Lago Convention. It is reported that Hungarian Foreign Minister Kánya declared that Hungary is prepared to sign a military treaty guaranteeing the independence of Austria and Hungary, but does not want to fight against Germany under any circumstances. It is heard that Hungary is now seeking to obtain the right to implement conscription, cancel accusations unfavorable to Hungary in the Marseille assassination case, and not to restrict Austria's right to revise the borders stipulated in the Treaty of Versailles in the non-interference agreement with Austria, as conditions for participating in the Danube River Convention. (National News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>Venice, Italy—Representatives from Italy, Austria, and Hungary held their third meeting today, which concluded in the afternoon. After today's meeting, the prospects for the nine-nation conference in Rome seem to be gradually improving. An official press release stated that Italy, Austria, and Hungary, in a spirit of friendship and cooperation, jointly held talks and proved that the goals of the three countries were completely consistent. They firmly believe that the preparatory work currently underway is sufficient to facilitate understanding among the countries involved in the Danube River Conference. The main result of the three-nation meeting was to enable Hungary to participate in the Danube River Conference. Hungary requested that the issues of military equality and the possibility of revising the treaty be considered in conjunction with the Torri del Lago Convention. After discussions at the Venice Conference, it seems that an agreement has been reached that the issue of military rearmament will not be discussed at the Rome Conference. However, Italy is solely responsible for suggesting that a special meeting be convened separately after the Rome Conference to discuss the issue of military rearmament. It is generally believed that Italy's attitude towards the Hungarian issue will not bind other countries, and the purpose of the non-interference agreement is solely to guarantee Austria's independence and prevent Austria's political system from being changed due to foreign propaganda. Therefore, after the non-interference agreement is signed, it will be even more difficult to restore the Habsburg dynasty. This should be satisfactory to the countries of the Little Entente. Regarding economic issues, it is reported that at the Venice Conference, Italy and Austria have agreed to renew trade agreements with Hungary and purchase Hungarian wheat. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Budapest, Hungary—It is generally believed that at the Venice three-nation conference, the Hungarian government has disregarded all difficulties and made all kinds of concessions to the maximum extent, but hopes that the three Little Entente countries will also make similar concessions at the Rome Conference. According to unconfirmed official sources, Hungary has agreed that if the countries concerned recognize that, in accordance with Article 19 of the Covenant of the League of Nations (which stipulates that outdated treaties may be submitted to the League of Nations Assembly for review by member states), certain territorial clauses in the treaty with Hungary may be amended in the future, Hungary will not raise the issue of treaty revision at the Rome Conference. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>(Rome) In order to ensure the success of the Torri del Lago Conference, the Italian government has decided to follow the resolutions of the Italy-Austria-Hungary conference in Venice and invite the foreign ministers of the Little Entente countries to Rome for the same preparatory meeting, so that the important issues to be discussed at the Danube River Conference can first be adequately understood. The date of this preparatory meeting has not yet been determined, but it will probably be held after the foreign ministers of the Little Entente countries meet in the Romanian capital on May 14. (National News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) News from Venice received by various newspapers here mostly stated that Italy will issue a formal declaration before the Danube River Conference, recognizing Hungary's military equality, but the way to achieve this will be through diplomatic negotiations. Furthermore, several newspapers believe that the reason why the joint declaration of the three countries after the Venice Conference did not mention maintaining the status quo in Central Europe is that they did not want to block Hungary from achieving its treaty revision claims through peaceful means. All parties in France are extremely satisfied with the results of the Venice Conference. (National News Agency, 7th)</p>

<h3>Franco-Soviet Pact Contains Secret Clauses; French Foreign Ministry Issues Denial</h3>
<p>(Paris) German newspapers claim that the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact contains secret clauses. Today, the French Foreign Ministry stated that this claim is completely unfounded. The Foreign Ministry also denied the issue of loans to Soviet Russia, as well as the claim that Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu agreed to allow Soviet Russia to pass through Romania to assist France in attacking Germany if necessary. It also stated that the clauses of the treaty have been fully published and there are no secrets. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) German newspapers reported that the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact contains secret clauses, the purpose of which is solely to deal with Germany, and that France will lend 500 million francs to cover Soviet military expenses. The Foreign Ministry has formally denied this claim, and stated that the issue of loans to Russia has never been mentioned. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>Baltic States Foreign Ministers Meet to Discuss Situation Created by Franco-Soviet Pact; Marshal Piłsudski Sends Confidant to Participate</h3>
<p>Kaunas—The news that Captain Beki, aide-de-camp to Polish Army Chief of Staff Marshal Piłsudski, will arrive here today has caused a stir in Lithuanian political circles, as the foreign ministers of the three Baltic states are currently meeting here.

<h3>Mixed Government Formed in Spain; Lerroux as Premier, Gil-Robles as Army Minister; Radical Party Joins Hands with Three Right-Wing Parties; Generally Regarded as Good Omen for Political Peace</h3>
<p>Madrid—People generally believe that Lerroux's formation of a mixed cabinet is a good omen for political peace, as the government now occupies 240 of the 439 seats in parliament, forming a majority. The list of cabinet members has already been decided and is as follows:</p>
<p>Premier: Lerroux; Foreign Minister: Roche; Army Minister: Gil-Robles; Navy Minister: Villlanueva; Justice Minister: Carceno Nova; Education Minister: Doder; Labor Minister: Salmon; Transportation Minister: Rusiia; Public Works Minister: Maracco; Agriculture Minister: Vanlai Yu; Commerce Minister: Arsben.</p>
<p>It is worth noting here that the Catholic Party occupies five cabinet seats, the Radical Party occupies four cabinet positions, and other cabinet members are from the Farmers' Party, the Liberal Democratic Party, and the Independent Republican Party. Therefore, this new cabinet has brought together all parties from the Republican center to the Republican right wing. The Catholic Church has a relatively superior influence, so it is possible that the policies of the new government will be more proactive than before. The parliament, which met yesterday, will meet again until Thursday to await the completion of the list of cabinet members. (National News Agency, 7th)</p>

<h3>New Incidents Emerge in East Africa; Italy Continues Mobilization; Three Army Divisions Ordered to Depart</h3>
<p>(Rome) Italian Premier Mussolini issued a new mobilization order today in order to ensure the security of the Italian territories in East Africa. According to a press release, the reasons for this move are: (1) Several European arms manufacturing plants have shipped large quantities of weapons to the capital of Abyssinia; (2) The Abyssinian government has adopted a mobilization plan; (3) The Abyssinian King's recent remarks are quite strong. One army division stationed in Sardinia will depart immediately due to today's order. Two divisions of the Fascist militia will also be dispatched. Reservists born in 1914 who have only served six months will also be called up. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to opinions in official circles here, the unfriendly relations between Italy and Abyssinia may become increasingly tense due to the recent incident of the murder of an Italian. It is heard that an Italian soldier was killed by an Abyssinian while going to the river to fetch water in the Ergogna area, and the weapons he was carrying were also robbed. The body was found on the Italian border, and the footprints of the murderer led directly into Abyssinian territory. This incident occurred on Saturday. Rome only received this news recently. Official circles regard this as an indication that Abyssinia cannot and does not want to maintain border order. It is expected that Italy will negotiate with the Abyssinian government regarding this matter. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>Swedish Military Supplies Exports Increase Year by Year</h3>
<p>Capital of Sweden—According to official statistics, the export value of Swedish military supplies in 1934 reached 18,911,142 kronor (Swedish currency) (17,642,000 kronor in 1933 and only 15,784,071 kronor in 1932).

<h3>Japan Pays Attention to US Shipbuilding Plan; Next Year's Japanese Army Budget to Exceed 500 Million Yen</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The US House of Representatives has approved the budget for 1935 to 1936, which includes funds for building new warships, and is currently under consideration by the Senate. The Japanese naval authorities are paying attention to the Senate's attitude. If this budget is passed by the Senate, the United States will begin building 24 new warships next year. Because 44 ships were already built last year, the United States will build 68 ships in two years, which is several times the number of ships built by Britain, France, and Italy. The main points of its shipbuilding plan are recorded as follows: Those started last year: (1) Two aircraft carriers, (2) Seven Class B cruisers, (3) Twenty-nine destroyers, (4) Six submarines, a total of 44 ships. Those to be started this year: (1) Fifteen destroyers, (2) Six minelayers, a total of 24 ships. In addition, there is one Class A cruiser stipulated by the treaty. Comparing this with the shipbuilding situation of Britain, France, and Italy, it can be seen how large the plan is.</p>
<p>Britain</p>
<p>Those started in fiscal year 1934: One aircraft carrier, four Class B cruisers, nine destroyers, two submarines, a total of 17 ships. Those started in fiscal year 1935: Three Class B cruisers, nine destroyers, three submarines, a total of 15 ships.</p>
<p>France</p>
<p>Those started in fiscal year 1934: One capital ship, one destroyer, six patrol ships, a total of nine ships. Those started in fiscal year 1935: One destroyer, three submarines, a total of four ships.</p>
<p>Italy</p>
<p>Two capital ships. (Japan United Press, 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Okada Cabinet has now begun to study the guiding principles for compiling next year's budget. The core of next year's budget is the Army's Capital Improvement Fee (i.e., the so-called Second National Defense Enhancement Fee). The balance of the first Capital Improvement Fee after next year is only 27 million yen, but judging from the current international situation, the Capital Improvement Fee for the next two or three years must be at least 120 million yen each year. According to the Army's estimate of next year's budget, its content is as follows: (1) Standard budget of 280 million yen, divided into a general budget of 200 million yen, an emergency preparedness fee for air defense forces of 68 million yen, a fee for improving various systems of 6 million yen, a fee for reforming education and training of 3 million yen, and a fee for reorganizing the Korean garrison division of 4 million yen. (2) Capital Improvement Fee of 100 million yen. (3) Manchurian Incident Fee of 140 million yen. (4) Several other new budgets. From this perspective, next year's Army budget will exceed 500 million yen. (Japan United Press, 7th)</p>
<h3>US Supreme Court Rules Railroad Pension Act Unconstitutional</h3>
<p>(Washington) The US Supreme Court today declared the Railroad Pension Act unconstitutional. This ruling is related to more than one million railway workers. Justice Roberts expressed the court's opinion, saying that this act is invalid because it violates due process of law. This act has no purpose or effect of regulating commerce and exceeds the power of Congress. It is said that this statement has established a principle, and the court's ruling on the National Recovery Act in the future may be affected by this. Chief Justice Hughes dissented alone, saying that this ruling deviates from sound principles and places inappropriate restrictions on the Constitution's commerce clause. One provision of the act made it enforceable on all interstate carriers, even those not directly related to interstate trade. This section was particularly disliked by the court. The court believed that the act could not be severed, so the court had no choice but to recognize that the entire act was invalid. Furthermore, this act was not designed to regulate interstate trade, so it is also invalid for this reason. In addition, the court also pointed out that railway workers who have voluntarily left freight service, or who have been dismissed for incompetence or misconduct, and those who have served for a full term and are naturally dismissed, must all be given a pension. When Roosevelt signed this act last June, he said that this case was hastily drafted and that the next Congress would have to make various revisions to it. In this court ruling, five justices agreed and four opposed. If this act was supported by the court, railway companies would increase their office expenses by 60 million yuan each year.

<h3>Overseas Chinese in Dutch East Indies Receive Unequal Legal Treatment; Blow to Emigration; Those Concerned with Overseas Chinese Affairs Should Not Overlook This</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Hague Correspondence: The Dutch East Indies is where most of our overseas Chinese gather, with a population of about 1.2 million. The businesses they run occupy an important position in the area, and the interconnected relationship with domestic economic institutions is also inseparable. For several years, the central government has repeatedly dispatched high-ranking officials to conduct inspections, with the aim of enhancing commerce and economy between China and the Dutch East Indies. The relationship between the two countries will become increasingly complex, and the various issues between the two countries must be resolved quickly. The most important issues are the Dutch East Indies' restrictions on immigration and the legal status of overseas Chinese. The origins of these two issues are summarized as follows: (1) Immigration Restriction Issue: Since 1933, the Dutch East Indies has been affected by the world economic crisis. The year before last, it proposed immigration restriction measures to provide relief. The content of the measures is: 1. The total number of immigrants entering each year must be specified. 2. If the number of entries is less than the quota, the number of immigrants may be increased by each ethnic group, but it must not exceed one-tenth of the total number of immigrants of that ethnic group into the Dutch East Indies in the ten consecutive years before the implementation of the new regulations. 3. After the quota limit is reached, only ethnic groups whose number of immigrants has not reached the limit are allowed to continue to immigrate. When this regulation was submitted to the Dutch East Indies National Assembly, our country believed that if this article were passed and implemented, not only would our country's emigration policy be hit, but also the economic status of overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies would be fatally shaken. If based on the new immigration law, the legal quota for Chinese to immigrate each year is only 800 people. The former acting representative of our embassy in the Netherlands sent a note to the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the same year, urging it to consider not allowing the regulations to be passed hastily. More than 30 Chinese chambers of commerce in the Dutch East Indies also jointly petitioned the Dutch Governor, hoping that he would find a way to revoke or amend it. The Dutch East Indies National Assembly passed the regulations and the Dutch government approved them. After Minister Jin Wensi took office, he repeatedly negotiated with the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs and urged it to respond as soon as possible. On December 14, 1933, he once again sent a note to the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, explaining our government's views and declaring the reservation of the right to raise this issue again in the future. This note was sent by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Ministry of Colonies and forwarded to the Dutch East Indies Governor. After the new regulations were implemented in January 1934, according to the report of our country's Consulate General in Batavia, based on the report of the Dutch East Indies Immigration Bureau, the number of Chinese entering the country in the past eleven months of last year has reached 6,771, which is more than the number of Chinese entering in 1932 (5,980 people) and 1933 (4,954 people). From this point of view, although the Dutch government has not formally recognized our country's demands in writing, it has in fact given us full sympathy. This year, the Dutch East Indies government explicitly announced that the total number of foreign nationals entering the country is still 12,000. It is still unknown whether the number of Chinese entering the country can maintain the original number of last year. Those concerned with overseas Chinese affairs should not overlook this. (2) Legal Treatment Issue: Article 163 of the Dutch East Indies Constitution stipulates that all Europeans and Japanese are collectively referred to as Europeans, while Chinese and Arabs are referred to as Eastern Foreigners. There are many points of unequal treatment. For example, European cases are tried by judges, but this is not the case for Eastern Foreigners. In criminal suspected cases, Europeans are arrested by the court, while Eastern Foreigners are detained by the police station. The facilities in European detention centers and prisons, and the treatment they enjoy, are superior to those of Eastern Foreigners. Our overseas Chinese have endured all this unequal treatment. When our national government established its capital in Nanjing, the former Dutch Governor (i.e., the current Foreign Minister Graeff) declared at the opening of the 11th regular meeting of the National Assembly on June 15, 1929, that the Chinese national government would promulgate family law on January 1 of the following year. If it can be implemented, the legal treatment of overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies can be equal to that of the Dutch. However, our laws on family and inheritance have been implemented successively since May 5 of the 20th year (i.e., 1931), but the legal treatment of our overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies has never been equal to that of Europeans, Americans, and Japanese. Our embassy in the Netherlands has continued to negotiate with the Dutch government. On May 2 of last year, the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to our embassy stating that the legal status of overseas Chinese, except for aspects of criminal procedure law that still need to be improved, can be treated equally with Europeans in terms of civil law, civil procedure law, commercial law, and criminal law. The legal treatment of overseas Chinese has indeed made progress, but to obtain the most satisfactory results, more efforts are still needed. (Central News Agency, 7th)</p>

<h3>Guangdong Province Promotes Local Autonomy</h3>
<p>Focuses on training people to exercise the four rights, land surveying and population census nearing completion</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence. Since the promulgation of local autonomy laws and regulations in July 1931, Guangdong Province has dispatched local autonomy assistant officers from the Department of Civil Affairs to assist various counties in preparing for local autonomy. Over the past four years, 95 county and municipal councils have been established, as well as 773 district offices, 12,546 township offices, and 688 town offices throughout the province. Neighborhood offices have not yet been counted. The Provincial Council was also established on August 15, 1934. However, due to the lack of education or economic backwardness in Ling Shui, Ganen, Changjiang, and Daoxian counties, the progress of local autonomy is relatively low. Other counties have made considerable progress. However, the first step in preparing for local autonomy is to train the people to exercise the four rights. If the people do not understand the exercise of the four rights, they may be easily manipulated by local gentry. Therefore, this training should be carried out in a gradual manner, starting with the training of cadres. Therefore, since July 1932, the Guangdong Provincial Local Autonomy Staff Training Institute was established to transfer autonomy personnel from district offices in various counties and cities to the institute for training. After completing their studies, they are sent back to serve, so as not to overstep or make mistakes. Subsequently, county councilor training classes were opened, and councilors from various counties and cities were drawn to attend training, so as to ensure that councilors from various counties and cities have a further understanding of the principles of self-governance. Furthermore, the rotational training method for autonomy personnel in counties, townships, and villages was revised, and autonomy trainers were dispatched to various counties to train the heads and deputy heads of townships and villages in various counties on a rotational basis. Up to now, the Local Autonomy Staff Training Institute has gone through ten terms, with approximately over 2,000 graduates. The County Councilor Training Class has also gone through two sessions, with approximately over 100 graduates. As for the training of the heads and deputy heads of townships and villages in various counties, the counties that have completed the training include Sanshui, Dongguan, Shunde, Jieyang, Boluo, Lingshan, Lianjiang, Xinyi, Guangning, Sihui, Gaoyao, Luoding, Qiongshan, Danxian, and other counties. Future work will continue. After the autonomy personnel at all levels in each county and city have received considerable training, ordinary people will be trained to understand the exercise of the four rights, so that they can gradually establish a model of local autonomy. As for the population census, a provincial population census implementation plan and implementation procedures have been formulated. In 1933, all counties were ordered to set up population census offices. October 1, 1933, was the date for the provincial population census. Up to now, more than 50 counties have completed the investigation and will soon be able to conclude the announcement. Once the investigation is completed, household registration control zones can be established in various counties in accordance with the Household Registration Law, with the heads of townships and villages concurrently serving as household registration directors to carry out personnel registration. Land surveying is also progressing gradually. Initially, the Provincial Government established the Guangdong Provincial Land Administration Personnel Training Institute to recruit and train students. After graduation, land surveying teams were formed. There have now been five graduating classes, and 44 surveying teams have been formed successively, which have been sent to Nanhai, Panyu, Xinhui, Taishan, Hepu, Gaoyao, Shunde, Dongguan, Qingyuan, [unclear]ping, Maoming, Shantou, and other counties and cities to carry out surveying. At present, a total of 354,504 houses and 850,059 mu of farmland have been surveyed. Future work will continue. Once the surveying of each county is completed, land registration can be compiled, and land taxes can be abolished and land taxes can be levied. The equalization of land ownership, which is a part of the Principle of People's Livelihood, can also be gradually implemented. Other aspects, such as the reorganization of local guards and the construction of roads, are also progressing. Recently, in order to promote the early completion of local autonomy, the Provincial Government has also revised the Guangdong Province Township and Village Autonomy Training Officer Dispatch Method and added township and village autonomy training officers, who are dispatched from graduates of the political advanced studies class of the Guangdong Military and Political School. The province is divided into five regions: Central, Eastern, Southern, Northwestern, and Qiongyai. Except for the counties that have been convened and trained by previous autonomy trainers, training officers will be assigned to the counties that have not been trained. Four groups are assigned to the central region, six groups to the eastern region, four groups to the northwest region, four groups to the southern region, and two groups to the Qiongyai region, with each group having more than 10 people or 8 or 9 people, and each group having a group leader and a deputy group leader. The work of the trainers includes: (1) training township and village autonomy personnel; (2) examining the actual situation of township and village autonomy; (3) publicizing the essentials of local autonomy. They can also provide guidance and supervision on other autonomy matters within their scope when necessary. The subjects for training autonomy personnel include: (A) Party ideology; (B) General principles of local autonomy; (C) Current autonomy laws and regulations; (D) Methods of exercising the four rights; (E) Elementary principles of people's rights. Additional subjects can be added as necessary. When trainers arrive in each county, they are divided into several small teams, with at least four people in each team, and they train in rotation. When they arrive at a district office, they convene the heads and deputy heads of the townships and villages under its jurisdiction for training. The training time is one week, and it can be extended if necessary. The training situation is reported at any time. If there are any difficult problems, the group leader convenes a meeting of group members to solve them, and a report must be submitted. Trainers receive food and lodging expenses and must not accept gifts from the public. The training methods and service regulations are roughly as described above. The main point is to promote local autonomy by starting with training in order to cultivate good autonomy personnel, which lies in engaging in practical work.</p>
<h3>Record of the Capture and Execution of the Bandit Leader "Black Face Zhang" in Southern Shandong</h3>
<p>Special Detectives from Shandong Arrest Zhang in Anhui; Executed After Interrogation by Han Fuqu</p>
<p>According to dispatches from Southern Shandong, Zhang Heilian (Black Face Zhang), a notorious bandit leader in the Yinan and Southern Shandong area, rivaling Liu Guitang and known as one of the "Two Blacks of Southern Shandong," once led tens of thousands of men, occupying the border area between Jiangsu, Shandong, and Anhui provinces for nearly two years.  Almost all the bandit leaders of Southern Shandong came from his ranks, considering themselves his followers. The counties of Teng, Yi, Lin, Cao, Ju, Yi, and Ri in Southern Shandong were all within his sphere of influence, earning him the title "King of Ten Thousand Mountains."  When Liu Guitang was incorporated into the government forces in 1932, Xia Ziming was sent to negotiate Zhang Heilian's incorporation as well.  He boarded a train in Teng County, but when the train reached Liangbudian Station, Zhang rebelled again, getting off the train midway and escaping into Mount Culaishan, then to Mount Mengshan. His subordinates scattered. In recent years, the Shandong authorities had been rigorously pursuing him. Zhang Heilian then left Shandong with a gun, hiding in Xinmaqiao, 70 li north of the city of Anhui, disguised as a farmer. He dug the ground, collected manure, feigned deafness and acted foolish.  Liu Yaoting, the leader of the Third Route Special Detective Team, upon discovering Zhang's hiding place, led his detectives there himself to make the arrest.  After four hours of searching, they captured Zhang and his bandit followers Sun Yewen and Liu Yuzhen in the area. At 8:00 AM on the fifth day, they arrived in Jinan. A major threat of many years was eliminated in one swoop, bringing great joy to the hearts of the people. The details of what happened are described below:</p>
<p>After Zhang Heilian's attempted incorporation failed in 1932 and he fled to Mount Mengshan, his subordinates died, scattered, deserted, and gradually disappeared. Feeling that the environment was unfavorable, he left Shandong for Anhui. He had four different residences. Zhang's father, Zhang Yunrang, lived in Pukou. Zhang's sister and his adopted son lived in a coal kiln in Huaiyuan County, 90 li west of Bengbu. Zhang's wife and daughters lived in Xinzhi, Anhui. Zhang himself traveled around, his whereabouts uncertain. Recently, he lived in the home of his adopted son, the bandit Sun Jiwen, in Xinmaqiao, 70 li north of Bengbu. Sun made a living by building houses and selling oil. Zhang lived there, disguised as a farmer, collecting manure every day, and acting crazy. The villagers called him a fool. Another bandit, Liu Yuzhen, also lived in the area, nicknamed "Pockmarked Liu the Second," living beyond the reach of the law. This was reported to Liu Yaoting, the leader of the Third Route Special Detective Team, who, at 8:50 PM one evening, took the director, Cai Licen, and four detectives, along with an informant, from Jinan to make the arrest. After arriving in Bengbu, they secretly investigated and learned that Zhang Heilian had recently moved from Xinji to Xinmaqiao. On the night of the third day, they departed from Bengbu Station and arrived in Xinmaqiao at 1:00 AM on the fourth day. After contacting the local security team in advance, the team surrounded Xinmaqiao. At that time, they went to the home of Zhang's adopted son, Sun Yewen. The informant went forward to knock on the door, falsely claiming to be Sun's brother-in-law, sent to deliver a message saying that the officials had sent people to arrest the "commander" (Zhang Heilian) and ordering him to prepare to escape. Sun Yewen was also afraid that it was a trick. After listening carefully, he realized that there were indeed the sounds of soldiers moving outside the village (the security team was indeed in the village). Sun hurriedly went to where the bandit was staying. The messenger pushed the door open. At this time, Liu Yaoting and the hidden detectives also followed. Liu shined a flashlight into the room, illuminating the bed, and the informant pointed to the person in the bed as Zhang Heilian. The detectives then pointed their guns at him, effortlessly arresting Zhang. His adopted son, Sun Yewen, was also captured at the same time. Zhang still denied being a bandit. Liu Yaoting falsely claimed that Liu "Pockmarked" (who had once been Zhang's regimental commander) had used 500 silver dollars to expose him. Knowing that he could not hide the truth, Zhang finally admitted that he was Zhang Heilian and said that Liu "Pockmarked the Second" was also a bandit living in the same village. Zhang then led the detectives to Liu "Pockmarked"'s house, where they captured Liu. Then, Liu Yaoting personally escorted them to the station. Zhang's wife and three daughters all came to the station to see him off. His wife cried, and his daughters cried too. The oldest daughter was over ten years old, and the younger ones were all under ten. They were all in tears, sobbing uncontrollably. Zhang told his wife and daughters, "You don't have to cry. I'm not coming back this time. Do whatever you have to do." His wife also said to Zhang, "You didn't bring any money. I borrowed for half a day in the village and couldn't borrow any." Zhang said, "I don't need money," and earnestly told his daughters, "You must be filial to your mother and listen to her." At this point, the detective team escorted Zhang onto a freight car heading north. After arriving in Xuzhou, they transferred to the Jinpu Line Train No. 22 and arrived in Jinan at 8:00 AM on the fifth day. They were then taken by car to the headquarters of the Special Detective Team on Xiaowei Sixth Road. At 9:00 AM, Liu went to the provincial government to report to Han Fuqu. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Wuxi Suzhou Tax Committee Holds Meeting in Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Donation and Tax Management Committee held a meeting last time and resolved to investigate the true situation of local donations and taxes in various counties. Each committee member was assigned a responsibility. Zhang Yunbo of Wu County was responsible for investigating twelve counties, including Su, Kun, Xi, Chang, Cheng, Yi, Yu, Ao, and Wujiang.

<h3>Resolution to Strengthen Public Security Forces</h3>
<p>The Wuxi County Public Security Bureau has recently experienced frequent cases in the urban area. The police force is too weak. Once something happens, they are unable to handle everything. They urgently need to strengthen their forces and purchase more guns and ammunition for defense. They also need to install telephones to facilitate communication. The bicycle fleet of the patrol team is old and damaged and cannot be repaired. They should also be replaced to facilitate duty. All of this was reported to the county government. It was discussed at the County Affairs Council meeting yesterday. It was resolved to approve the purchase of twelve bicycles, sixty White Lingham pistols, and six thousand bullets. As for the installation of telephones, it was decided to first install them at the five city gates of the east, west, south, north, and Guangfu, and at the eight ferries, including Du Gang. A special request was submitted to use the surplus funds from the 12th fiscal year and to add telephone operating expenses.</p>
<h3>Changshu Rickshaw Pullers' Strike Quickly Resolved</h3>
<p>More than 500 rickshaw pullers in the county suddenly went on strike on the morning of the fifth, forming a team to petition the Party and government agencies. The reason was that recently, some rickshaw puller foremen organized a union, requiring each rickshaw puller to donate five copper coins per day as membership fees. Recently, the rickshaw pullers have had little business, making it difficult to bear the burden. Furthermore, the large amount of money donated to the union was useless and only used by a few people. Therefore, they rebelled together. After persuasion by the Party and government agencies and the guarantee that the donation would be canceled, the result was very satisfactory. Some of the rickshaw pullers resumed work at 3:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Changzhou Student Crushed to Death at Wansheng Iron Factory</h3>
<p>Shu Wanniu, an eighteen-year-old student from the Wuyi Xinximen Road Wansheng Iron Factory, a resident of Dong'an Township, Ninth District, was working the night shift at the factory at around 8:00 PM on the evening of the sixth. He accidentally touched the machine shaft, resulting in both legs being crushed and the brain also being crushed, with fluids pouring out. The factory manager, realizing the accident, immediately stopped the machine and sent the injured person to Wujin Hospital for treatment. However, due to the severity of the injuries, he died soon after.</p>
<h3>Nantong Public Memorial for Martyrs Who Died Fighting Japanese Pirates</h3>
<p>All sectors of Nantong will hold a public memorial on the 59th National Humiliation Day at Langshan Road for Cao Ding, a martyr of the Ming Dynasty who died fighting Japanese pirates. Zhang Gongren, the Party Affairs Instructor of the Fourth District of Jiangsu Province, will preside over the ceremony. Nantong and the counties of the area have raised 30,000 yuan to rebuild a special ancestral hall for the martyr and to establish a memorial elementary school, which will also be built within days.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Detective Team Captures Bracelet Robber</h3>
<p>Zhongxing, the four-year-old son of Zhu Songyuan, the director of Gongbu Xinda Transport Company, was crying alone along the Datong Canal yesterday (the sixth) evening. Shen Jiang, a boatman of the company, noticed him and took him home. While walking along the river near Majiaqiao, a bandit suddenly came from behind and robbed the silver bracelet from the child's wrist. At that time, Hong Jingru, the captain of the detective squad stationed in Gongbu of the Public Security Bureau, and squad member Li Qishu passed by and, after hearing the news, gave chase. They captured a robber named Ding Baoshan. The victim and the child confirmed that he was the robber. He has been sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Haimen Villager Shot to Death by Thieves</h3>
<p>Mao Xianrong, a villager near Hezhen in the Fifth District, was moderately wealthy. At around 9:00 PM the day before yesterday, more than ten bandits suddenly broke into his house, looting extensively. They stole more than 30 yuan and more than ten pieces of clothing. As they were leaving, Mao shouted for help and was shot in the abdomen by the thieves and died on the spot. Mao's son, Shimin, who is studying at the Nengren Middle School in the county, reported to the county government yesterday after receiving the news. Chen Chengshen went to examine the body and instructed the family to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>

<h3>Banks Increase Lending to Industry and Commerce; Member Banks Increase Commitment by 500,000 Yuan; Money Trade Association to Meet on 10th to Discuss</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, after the amount of 5 million yuan for lending to industry and commerce was determined, the Bankers Association held a meeting to discuss it and recommended Chairman Ye and Wang to report to Finance Minister Kong. The association has agreed to raise 1.5 million yuan and will contact the major banks separately. The Money Trade Association is scheduled to meet on the 10th to discuss it. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Three Banks Comply with Order to Undertake</p>
<p>After Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi planned to change the method of underwriting the 5 million yuan loan to industry and commerce to 1 million yuan from the Central Bank, 1 million yuan from the Bank of China, 500,000 yuan from the Bank of Communications, 1.5 million yuan from the Bankers Association, and 2 million yuan from the Money Trade Association, the Central Bank has complied, handled by Xi Demao, the manager of the Business Bureau. The Bank of China will immediately hand over the 1 million yuan to Bei Songsun, the manager of the Shanghai branch. The Bank of Communications will add 100,000 yuan to the already committed 400,000 yuan and hand it over to Zhang Peishen, the manager of the Business Bureau. (New Life News Agency)</p>
<p>Bankers Association to Issue Notice</p>
<p>The amount of 5 million yuan for lending to industry and commerce has been generally decided. The Bankers Association convened an executive committee meeting the day before yesterday and invited representatives from member banks to attend. As a result of the discussion, the association decided to raise 1 million yuan and asked the banks that had already committed to double their commitment. Those who had not committed or committed less were asked to increase their commitment. The association has drafted a letter based on the proceedings of the meeting and will notify the member banks. After the letter is finalized and signed by the standing committee members, it will be issued today. (Central News Agency below)</p>
<p>Chairman Ye and Wang Report to Kong</p>
<p>As for the remaining 500,000 yuan, the association originally planned to ask Finance Minister Kong to contact non-member banks to commit. There are still 50 to 60 banks in Shanghai that have not joined the association. Expanding the scope would make it easier to raise funds. Therefore, it was decided, and the two standing committee members, Ye Fuxiao and Wang Yansong, were recommended to report to Finance Minister Kong and state this intention. Ye and Wang went to the Central Bank after the meeting to report to Kong.</p>
<p>500,000 Yuan Successfully Negotiated</p>
<p>According to a written reply from Ye to a reporter from the Central News Agency, "As a result of reporting to Kong, the remaining 500,000 yuan will still be committed by member banks." According to Lin Kanghou, the secretary-general of the Bankers Association, he received a telegram from Ye stating that Finance Minister Kong found it cumbersome and difficult to conduct separate negotiations with non-member banks, and this matter could not be delayed any longer. Therefore, the Bankers Association was asked to try its best to raise the funds. The Bankers Association will fulfill the purpose of the Ministry of Finance to rescue industry and commerce and practice the function of regulating finance. It has now agreed to find a way to raise funds again. However, some banks with less capital have already committed as much as they can. Therefore, the association has decided to have the responsible person negotiate with banks with strong capital to increase their commitment in order to raise the funds as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Money Trade Association Schedules Meeting to Discuss</p>
<p>The Money Trade Association had previously resolved to participate in the commitment of 250,000 yuan, which would be shared equally by the member money shops. However, Finance Minister Kong requested an increase to 1 million yuan. Although the chairman of the association, Qin Runqing, accepted at the time, the amount was four times the original amount and required the approval of all members. It is reported that the Executive Committee meeting originally scheduled for the 10th (Friday) will invite representatives from the member money shops to attend in order to report on the proceedings of the tea party attended by Finance Minister Kong and to discuss ways to collect the funds.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Plans to Implement Grain Control</h3>

Liang Jingzhong, Zhou Dian, Wu Zengnian, and Huang Jiangquan have been appointed as management committee members, with Liang Jingzhong as the director. The control regulations and the organizational rules of the management committee have been drafted and submitted to the Executive Yuan for submission to the Legislative Yuan for review.

<h3>Aviation Association Squadron Leader's Office Sends Letters Urging Wealthy Individuals to Donate; Squadron Leader Cai Jingjun Obtains 5,000 Yuan in Contributions</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Search Team Squadron Leader's Office of the Chinese Aviation Association previously stated that the micro-contribution campaign was a major undertaking, and if they did not pool their strength, they would not succeed. They sent letters to the wealthy individuals in the city, setting four types of donations based on their economic situation: 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, and 10,000 yuan. It is reported that the wealthy individuals have mostly successively sent the original amount to the office for collection. A few have not yet done so. The office sent another letter yesterday urging them to quickly donate the predetermined amount to achieve the great cause. It is believed that the wealthy individuals are all enthusiastic patriots and will step forward courageously and generously donate to contribute to the cause.</p>
<p>The Squadron Leader's Office has received dues and donations from various squadrons very enthusiastically, as reported previously. It is reported that yesterday they received 300 yuan in dues from Tang Jiji, the squadron leader of the 242nd squadron, and a report from Zhu Yinjiang, the squadron leader of the 214th squadron, that they had received more than 100 yuan in contributions.

He will report on his success later. It can be seen that Squadron Leader Cai is enthusiastically and diligently promoting the aviation and national salvation campaign. It is hoped that other squadrons will follow suit and work together to achieve a great cause.</p>
<h3>Guangxi Provincial Government Did Not Borrow Money from British-American Tobacco Company</h3>
<p>Foreign Reports Are Not True</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Yang Chuo'an, a member of the Economic Commission of the Guangxi Provincial Government and director of the Statistics Bureau of the province, came to Shanghai a few days ago to investigate industry and commerce and has already left Shanghai. Foreign reports stated that Yang borrowed 20 million yuan from the Shanghai British-American Tobacco Company, to be paid in four years, as construction expenses for the province, using tobacco raw materials produced in Guangxi as collateral, and that the company would have exclusive rights to purchase tobacco in the province for 15 years. According to inquiries from various relevant parties, the rumor of this loan is not true.</p>
<h3>Summer House Tax Scheduled to Be Collected in the City</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau, in order to improve the system of collecting house taxes, submitted a request to the municipal government for approval from the central government to amend Articles 13 and 16 of the House Tax Regulations. For all commercial and residential households with quarterly house taxes of 10 yuan or more, the tax collection office will issue a notice before the start of each quarter. After receiving the notice, taxpayers must bring the notice to the tax collection office to pay within 15 days. If they have not paid within 10 days after the deadline, staff will be sent to collect the tax at their door, and a penalty of 2% of the tax due will be added. For households with house taxes of less than 10 yuan, staff will still be sent by the tax collection office to collect the tax. Those who wish to pay at the tax collection office themselves may do so. The house tax for this summer is scheduled to begin on May 16.</p>
<h3>International Radio Station Expands Facilities</h3>
<p>Zhenru Transmitting Station Adds High-Power Transmitter; Shanghai-Guangdong-Hankou Wireless Telephone Equipment to Be Completed Soon; Expansion of Teleprinter Telephone Receiving and Sending Business Report Equipment</p>
<p>The Shanghai Ministry of Communications International Radio Station has its general management office and central receiving and sending office in the Sassoon Building at the Renji Road intersection, and its transmitting stations are located in Zhenru and Fenglinqiao. Due to the station's thriving southern business and a large increase in external communication lines, the original equipment was insufficient. A 20-40 kilowatt shortwave transmitter was purchased from the United States. The station staff rushed to install the equipment, and the Ministry of Communications ordered Yu Ruxin and Shen Shuren to come to Shanghai to inspect and accept the equipment. It is now officially in use, which has greatly facilitated the station's communication with Europe and the United States. The Ministry of Communications originally designated the Shanghai-Guangdong-Hankou wireless telephone communication affairs to be under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, but for the sake of economic position and convenience in engineering, the Shanghai portion of the equipment was attached to the internal facilities of the International Radio Station and ordered to be installed by the station. This is now generally ready. However, the construction of 16 iron towers in Zhenru and Liuhang to prepare for hanging antennas is still in progress due to the large scale of the project.</p>
<p>In order to improve the speed of telegraph delivery for various merchants in the city, the station installed a telephone line exchange in the central receiving and sending room of the station at Renji Road, Shanghai, so that major merchants can use teleprinters or telephones to directly contact the station's telegraph room. A single room is used to allow telegrams to be received and sent as soon as possible, which is extremely fast. Currently, the number of major merchants applying to the station to use this dedicated line is increasing daily, and they are all praising its convenience.</p>
<h3>International Problems Research Association: Yesterday's Speech on the Truth of Anti-Chinese Sentiment in Siam, Suppression of Education and Ruin of Industry and Commerce, No Stone Left Unturned; Miscellaneous Grain Association to Discuss Boycott of Siamese Rice Today</h3>
<p>To clarify the truth about the Siamese government's active anti-Chinese sentiment and the plight of overseas Chinese, and to show support, the International Problems Research Association invited a certain petition representative of overseas Chinese returning from Siam to make a detailed report at the Bank Club at 5:30 PM yesterday. More than 30 people attended, including Cao Yunxiang, Guo Bingwen, Shen Xinqing, Chen Liting, Zhang Xianglin, He Dekui, Cheng Haifeng, Tu Youyu, etc. Chen Liting presided over the meeting.</p>
<p>Abuse of Overseas Chinese: Various Harsh Regulations</p>
<p>Mr. So-and-so first stated that after the completion of the Siamese constitutional government, they have been making every effort to assimilate overseas Chinese. All measures are aimed at making the more than 3 million overseas Chinese in Siam, who account for a quarter of the total population of Siam, completely become Siamese people. Next, he elaborated on (1) amending the immigration law to reject illiterate people from entering, restricting the southward migration of laborers and women, and arranging for overseas Chinese in Siam to marry Siamese women so that their offspring will forget their motherland; (2) suppressing overseas Chinese education, having already closed more than 60 overseas Chinese schools one after another, restricting those under the age of 14 to study in Siamese public schools and forbidding them from learning Chinese; (3) ruining overseas Chinese industry and commerce by heavily taxing various industries, attempting to reclaim the alcohol industry to be managed by the government, and recently planning to control foreign exchange, so that overseas Chinese cannot remit money back to their country; (4) the newly promulgated fisheries regulations limit fishing licenses to Siamese citizens, so overseas Chinese fishermen have to have their Siamese wives obtain the licenses, and the Siamese government also issued regulations restricting the workers employed by fishermen to be 75% Siamese; (5) children of overseas Chinese under the age of 14 are in the period of compulsory education and are not allowed to leave Siam, and upon reaching the age of 18, they are subject to military service and must serve, otherwise they will be punished for evading military service. This regulation was originally scheduled to be implemented on April 1, but because many overseas Chinese planned to send their children back to their home country, the Siamese government temporarily postponed it and will implement it near September 1.</p>
<p>Banning Siamese Rice: No Harm to Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>Subsequently, Mr. He Dekui asked whether boycotting Siamese rice would affect overseas Chinese in Siam. Mr. So-and-so replied that most overseas Chinese in Siam are engaged in industry and commerce and do not grow grains. Although there are more than 100 rice mills, most also operate other businesses. Recently, Siamese rice mills have been losing money due to farmers hoarding rice. If our country stops dealing in Siamese rice, it will not only not harm overseas Chinese who run rice mills, but it can also reduce losses. The farmers are the ones who will suffer the losses, and the current rulers of Siam, who want to gain the trust of the farmers, are deeply afraid of losing the support of the people and shaking their political position, so they will definitely be willing to sign a trade treaty with our country, and so on. The association decided to submit the aid plan to the board of directors for discussion.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grain Association to Discuss Today</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of Siam discriminating against overseas Chinese, the Overseas Chinese United Association put forward opinions, requesting the rice industry in this city to ban the import of Siamese rice to boycott and urge the Siamese government authorities to pay attention. They also sent representatives to meet with Mr. Gu Xinyi the day before yesterday to inquire about his opinions. The Miscellaneous Grain Association specifically scheduled a meeting to be held at 4:00 PM today to discuss the matter and plan to send a telegram to the Siamese government requesting improvement in the treatment of overseas Chinese. The above telegram is currently being drafted and will be submitted for discussion at today's meeting. It will be sent after it is passed, it is said.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Submits to the Ministry of Finance: Requesting Exemption from Export Tax on Chinese Medicine</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a memorial to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating, "Regarding the matter of submitting a petition, according to a letter from the Pharmaceutical Industry Guild dated the 4th of this month, our country's medicinal materials are produced in Sichuan, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Guangxi, and other provinces. They are first collected in cities and then transported to other places. Shanghai is a commercial hub, so medicinal materials from various places must first be concentrated and then transferred. Therefore, the number of medicinal herbs re-exported and exported in a year is quite large. Now, when the government is formulating tax regulations, the various re-export taxes have been exempted from June 1, while the various export taxes are still under review. According to the regulations, there is a distinction between tax exemption and no tax exemption. However, for our medicinal materials, there is a surplus in our country that can be transported overseas, and there is also a need for our country's medicinal materials overseas. Often, due to the payment of taxes, the price is not suitable, resulting in the suspension of transportation. Therefore, the payment of taxes hinders the export of our country's medicinal materials, which is a pity. For this reason, we especially request your esteemed council to forward this memorial to the Ministry of Finance, taking advantage of the fact that the standards for reducing and exempting export taxes are still under negotiation, to request that all export medicinal materials be exempt from taxes, in order to maintain business difficulties and to promote domestic goods. We await orders with trepidation." After investigation, Chinese medicinal materials are exported to places where overseas Chinese gather. For example, in Vietnam, the export of domestic medicinal materials at its peak reached more than 800,000 taels of silver per year. Later, French pharmacists, envious of its benefits, instigated the government to obstruct it in various ways, and the exports have gradually decreased year by year. This matter is related to the needs of overseas Chinese medical treatment and is also a natural product that can cultivate the population. It is urgently necessary to exempt taxes to encourage exports in order to increase by-products, help save rural areas, and plug loopholes. According to the previous situation in the letter, it is reasonable to submit a memorial. We request your ministry to review and approve the inclusion of exported medicinal materials in the tax exemption list, which would be of public benefit.</p>
<h3>The Special Party Department of the Chinese Seamen Convenes: The National Seamen Party Department Holds a Meeting</h3>

To clarify the number of illiterate people in the city in order to allocate the number and location of schools, survey committees have been organized in various districts, and the survey work will begin today. The survey is scheduled to be completed by the end of the month. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Closed Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the beginning of Literacy Promotion Week on May 1, industry, agriculture, commerce, schools, radio broadcasting, film, entertainment, and other sectors have expanded publicity on a daily basis, which has enabled the citizens of this city to have a considerable understanding of the significance of literacy education and the methods of the municipal government in promoting literacy education. The promotion week closed yesterday, and the association also stipulated continued publicity measures to avoid short-term efforts. The main points are as follows: (1) Surveyors should carry books and leaflets with them when surveying out-of-school people and distribute them at any time. They should also add advice when questioning the people; (2) literacy schools should hold more parent-teacher conferences or recreational activities and should contact local community groups and schools to carry out literacy campaigns; (3) when the Public Security Bureau conducts household registration checks or when newly relocated residents come to the bureau to register, it should inquire at any time whether there are illiterate people and should guide them to nearby literacy schools to contact for enrollment; (4) this association also paints books or texts about literacy education on the walls of main streets; (5) this association contacts film companies to produce one or two films of the literacy movement for screening at any time.</p>
<p>Organize a Committee to Investigate</p>
<p>In order to clarify the situation of out-of-school people in the city so that literacy education can be implemented, a survey committee was specially established in each district to assist the district office in handling the survey of out-of-school people. Since the establishment of district offices on May 1, survey committees have been organized. The committee members are selected from the principals of public and private schools in each district, the directors of public and private social education institutions, the heads of the Public Security Bureau, party committee members, municipal committee members, defense regiment leaders or captains, and those who are enthusiastic about public welfare and enjoy popular support. A survey director is also appointed.

<p>In addition to the Jiangwan Experimental District, which has completed the survey, and the Confucius Temple Experimental District, which has begun the survey, the other ten districts have all scheduled to begin the survey at the same time today. Survey forms have been distributed to each district. In addition to the items of name, gender, age, and occupation, there are also literacy level (divided into completely illiterate, knowing one-half, four-sixths), free time to go to literacy schools, which month is the most inconvenient, detailed address, and the number of literate and illiterate people in the family must be filled in. Surveyors also carry a 600-word list. When surveying, they first ask each person whether they are literate and ask them to try to read the 600-word list. If they can read one or two lines in a row without difficulty, they are considered literate people. Otherwise, they are considered illiterate people, and they start filling out the survey form. If the surveyor cannot decide, they should ask them to read a few more lines or read the entire list. If they know more than five-sixths, they are considered literate people.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Writes to the Money Industry Guild Urging Discussion of the Bill Discounting Method</h3>
<p>Since the Silk and Satin Industry Guild advocated holding commercial acceptance bills, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has actively promoted it and published a special issue in the Commercial Monthly, explaining it in detail, which has attracted the attention of the financial market. However, regarding the discounting method, the Bankers Association has already protected six principles and designated Jing Runshi and Xue Yisheng as representatives to discuss it at any time. However, the Money Industry Guild has not yet replied. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce specially urged it yesterday, stating, "According to a letter from the Silk and Satin Industry Guild in this city dated the 6th of this month, we learned that the commercial acceptance bills have been approved for rediscounting by the Central Bank, but it is necessary to first discuss the discounting method with the banking and money industries, etc. We have also read in the newspaper that your meeting has decided to send letters to the banking and money industry guilds to formulate methods, and to designate representatives to jointly discuss the progress, etc. We are very pleased to see your association's enthusiastic promotion of this bill. However, more than a month has passed, and all discounting methods have been formulated. Your association is discussing the progress. We urgently hope to receive a letter of instruction so that we can follow suit." Based on this, this case was approved in the Central Bank's reply letter on March 21. Later, letters were sent to the banking industry and your association to inquire about it under the letter Pu No. 1892. Later, the Bankers Association replied with six methods, which were submitted to the 40th Standing Committee meeting for resolution. After the money industry replied, they will be transferred to the Central Bank for a meeting on rediscounting. In view of the previous situation, we urge you again, hoping that your association will promptly reply with the commercial acceptance bill discounting method so that we can send a letter to the Central Bank to discuss rediscounting. We deeply hope for your assistance.</p>
<h3>Wu Hua Bank Case: Fan Shaoliang Appeals Against the Original Judgment</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai branch of the Guangzhou Wu Hua Industrial Trust Bank at 130 Ningbo Road in the Public Concession and the Wu Hua Branch branch at the intersection of Gao Baolu Road and Xiafei Road in the French Concession closed down in August of last year, the depositors, savings depositors, and ten other creditors of the two banks filed a complaint with the criminal court, stating that the bank had been closed for a long time and there was no indication of the creditors' rights. They appointed a lawyer to accuse Fan Shaoliang, Jian Yu, Ye Haitian, Wu Yousan, Xie Zhizhi, Tang Yushan, Counselor Tang Shoumin, Chen Bingqian, and others, managers and deputy managers of the two branches of the Wu Hua Bank, of fraud and breach of trust, and requested legal action to be taken against them in accordance with the banking regulations issued by the Ministry of Finance. After repeated hearings and investigations by Judge Zhang Chaozu of the Special Court, a verdict was rendered on the 15th of last month. Fan Shaoliang and Ye Haitian (deputy manager of the branch) were each fined 1,000 yuan for operating a savings bank business without the approval of the Ministry of Finance, which could be commuted to one day of imprisonment for every three yuan. They were found not guilty of the charges of fraud and breach of trust, and the remaining defendants were found not guilty. These details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that Fan and Ye are dissatisfied with this judgment and have appointed lawyers Jiang Yiping and Hua Maosheng to file an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court with the Second Court, requesting that the case files be sent to the High Court. A hearing will be held soon.</p>
<h3>The Fisheries Protection Office Intercepts Fishing Boats; The Haihu Patrol Ship Sinks Pirates</h3>
<p>The fisheries patrol ships of the Fisheries Protection Office of the Ministry of Industry have been sparing no effort in arresting pirates. Recently, they discovered a fishing boat with 15 hostages in the Mazi waters. The details are as follows: The Jin Xiangmao ice-fresh fishing boat was buying fresh fish in the outer sea on the 4th of this month and was fully loaded to return to Shanghai. When passing through the Yangshan waters, a pirate ship with more than 20 pirates suddenly approached the Jin Xiangmao ice-fresh fishing boat, threatened it with guns, and forced the ship to sail to Mazi in an attempt to rob it. Unexpectedly, on the 5th, when it arrived in the Mazi waters, it encountered the Haihu patrol ship of the No. 2 Fisheries Protection Office of the Ministry of Industry, which was patrolling the waters. The patrol ship found the two ice-fresh fishing boats suspicious and ordered them to stop for investigation. Unexpectedly, the pirates ignored the order and accelerated to escape. The Haihu ship opened fire to stop them. The pirate ship also opened fire in response. After an hour of fierce fighting, the patrol ship's firepower was fierce and hit the mast of the pirate ship. The pirates were finally outnumbered and fled back to the original ship, abandoning the Jin Xiangmao fishing boat. At that time, the sky was already dark, and the wind and waves were strong. The ship still tried to pursue them, but the pirates had already left on the fishing boat and shouted for help. Because the boat needed to protect the equipment of the Yu Zuomao fishing boat, it did not pursue them. In this interception, one Jin Xiangmao ice-fresh fishing boat and 15 crew members were captured. According to the crew, one or two pirates were shot and fell into the water during the fierce battle, and at least five or six people were injured. As the pirates were eager to escape, the ship's life and property were not lost at all.</p>
<h3>Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, Tie Lisheng, Dies After Falling from a Horse</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Tie Lisheng, Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, has been following Minister Kong for many years and has always been favored by Kong. Recently, he has been assisting Kong in Shanghai and is known for his ability. As a reporter, I had several elegant encounters with him during official business. I was very surprised to hear of Mr. Tie's sudden death, as he was usually in good health. I went to the office of the Ministry of Finance in Shanghai to inquire about the details, which are recorded as follows: Mr. Tie's brief resume: Mr. Tie's name is Guanjun, his style name is Lisheng, and he is 34 years old this year. He is from Jin County, Hebei. He served as the head of the New Recruit Replenishment Regiment of the Northwest Border Defense Command, the law enforcement officer of the Former Enemy General Law Enforcement Department, and the section chief of the Ministry of Industry. He is currently the secretary of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>Cause of Death: Mr. Tie has always valued physical education. In his spare time, he always does various sports. A friend recently brought a horse from Shanxi and Bei. On the afternoon of the 3rd of this month, Mr. Tie and several followers went to Hongqiao to try the horse. Unexpectedly, the horse was unruly, and Mr. Tie was thrown to the ground, injuring his brain. He was unconscious at the time and was sent to Hongqiao Hospital by his followers. Due to his serious injuries, he died at 2:00 AM on the 4th after unsuccessful treatment.</p>
<p>Posthumous Honor: After Mr. Tie's death, his colleagues in Shanghai transferred his body to the Shanghai Funeral Home, where a grand funeral was held in the afternoon. Minister Kong was very saddened to hear of Mr. Tie's death. In the afternoon, he personally went to the Shanghai Funeral Home to pay his respects and expressed his condolences to his family. Zhang Zhijiang, the former Director of the Western Jiang Defense, was Mr. Tie's former superior and also made a special trip to offer condolences. Many of Mr. Tie's classmates and old friends in Shanghai went to offer condolences after hearing the news. The funeral arrangements were organized by Li Qingxuan and other counselors from the Ministry of Finance, who will hold a funeral service at the Shanghai Funeral Home on Fenglin Bridge, Xujiahui Road, in the French Concession, on the 12th of this month. A memorial service will be held on the morning of the same day.</p>
<h3>The Taxpayers Association Asks the Public Works Department to Pay Attention to the Safety Equipment of Public Buses: Repeated Indulgences Have Led to Another Accident Involving the No. 9 Bus</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association wrote to the Public Works Department yesterday, stating, "According to a letter from the Fenghua Native Place Association in Shanghai, 'According to our fellow villager Fei Hu's crying to the association, his son Fei Ran, aged 18, worked as a carpenter to make a living. Unfortunately, on the morning of the 9th of April, at 8:30 AM, while walking along Broadway Road and Hua Ji Road with Fei Sen's mourners, a No. 9 public bus sped by and was unable to avoid it, causing him to be knocked down and seriously injured. The patrolman on duty at the scene rushed to the scene and sent the injured person to Tongren Hospital, but he died of internal injuries before arriving in Shanghai. The court has already inspected the case on April 20. Now, the victim has an elderly grandmother and two other family members who depend on him for support. Now that he has died unexpectedly, the family has lost its reliance and is in a desperate situation. Therefore, we earnestly request you to find a way to assist and forward a letter to the public bus company for compensation.' Based on this, reports of public buses injuring people have been frequently recorded in newspapers. The reasons are nothing more than (1) drivers relying on foreign merchants, treating human lives like child's play, and not paying attention; (2) competing with trams to reach the station first, thereby disregarding pedestrians and causing accidents; (3) the Public Works Department often favors public buses that injure pedestrians, not initiating public prosecutions, making drivers bold and reckless. Regarding the above three points, we should ask your association to find a way to negotiate with the Public Works Department. And regarding the case of Fei Ranyuan being knocked down and killed, we also request your association to provide relief so that the company will provide generous compensation and avoid freezing to death." In view of this, the accidents caused by public buses have become commonplace, and the authorities of the bus company are indulging them. They are stingy and irresponsible for compensation and consolation. There is a need for sanctions. The association has repeatedly informed you of the safety equipment of buses, but your bureau still allows them to remain the same, which is a betrayal of the trust of taxpayers. Approving the previous letter, we hereby request your bureau to immediately order the company to be responsible for compensation and consolation for all injury and death incidents and to install safety equipment. This is of the utmost importance."</p>
<h3>Suspected Wife's Infidelity, Committing Suicide with a Sharp Blade, Death So Swift, Case So Strange</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning around 9 o'clock, a bloody incident occurred inside an unnumbered tile-roofed house adjacent to the West Zhongxing Cotton Mill on Zhongxing Road, Zhabei. The deceased, named Shen Jifeng, was 35 years old and from Yancheng. He had a wife, Ms. Qi, 26 years old, who was of fair appearance. Shen usually made a living pulling a rickshaw. The day before yesterday, around 5 PM, he went out to pull a night shift, and his wife also went out. According to Ms. Qi, she went to her mother's house in Hongkou. When Shen returned home early yesterday morning around 7 AM, he was extremely angry to find his wife not at home. After 9 AM, Ms. Qi returned from outside, and Shen immediately grabbed and beat her, though not severely. After the beating, Ms. Qi cried at the Lin shop. Shen Jifeng forbade his wife from crying and later threatened her with a sharp blade. Somehow, Shen did not injure his wife, but stabbed himself in the left side of his chest. He immediately bled and fell to the ground. Someone reported the incident to Ning Kaiging, officer number 59 of the Taiyangmiao Police Station of the Xinzha branch. The injured man, accompanied by Ms. Qi, was sent to Pushan Hospital on Xinmin Road for treatment. However, by the time they arrived at the hospital, he had already lost too much blood. After examination, the doctor determined that he was beyond saving and ordered Shen to be taken home immediately. Upon returning home and entering the door, he breathed his last and died. Officer Ning then took Ms. Qi to the station for questioning and transferred her to the Xinzha branch. He also instructed the local guarantor, Wang Shaoting, to report the incident to the Shanghai Local Court for an autopsy. Yesterday evening, the deceased was seen lying on a plank door, wearing one each of blue, white, and black cloth short jackets, with a flannel shirt underneath. There was a knife wound on his chest, about a few fractions of an inch wide. He wore black cloth leggings, white cloth shoes, and gray thread socks, and had a Western-style haircut. There were others living with the deceased, but they had all fled. The guarantor sent someone to guard the door. According to neighbors, the deceased had brothers in his hometown, and a 13-year-old daughter named Abao from his previous wife. It is said that someone has already sent a letter to the deceased's hometown to inform them.</p>
<h3>Large Quantity of Red Pills Discovered at the South Railway Station, Suspicious Traveler Abandoned Two Suitcases and a Bedroll Unclaimed, 113,211 Red Pills Confiscated</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 10 AM, the Shanghai South Railway Station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, the station police and railway police jointly inspected two suitcases and a bedroll abandoned by a passenger, containing a large quantity of poisonous red pills, totaling 113,211 pills. They were sent to the Songhu Garrison Command for processing. The details are as follows: On the 4th of this month, at approximately 7 AM, a passenger, around 20 years old, carrying two suitcases and a bedroll, arrived at the station and purchased two third-class through tickets from the Shanghai South Station to Yiwu Station, Zhejiang. When the passenger presented the ticket and went to the baggage room to purchase baggage tickets, the baggage clerk, Jiang Xianting, informed the passenger that the suitcases must be inspected according to regulations before they could be weighed and loaded onto the baggage car. The passenger replied that the suitcase keys were with another passenger, and he had forgotten to bring them. He would bring them later to open the suitcases for inspection. After he left, he did not return to claim the suitcases for over three hours. Therefore, the baggage clerk informed the on-duty railway police patrol leader, Xu Ximing, who searched everywhere without success. Subsequently, the baggage clerk, Jiang Xianting, and patrol leader, Xu Ximing, separately reported the matter to their superiors for handling. Han Shangying, the chief of the police section, together with stationmaster Yu Dewen, sealed the abandoned suitcases and bedroll with fire lacquer for safekeeping and temporarily stored them in the police section. In addition to temporarily storing the passenger's two through tickets with the stationmaster, police were dispatched to search everywhere. Like a crane seeking a phoenix, they waited until the morning of the 7th of this month. Because three days had passed without any passenger coming to the station to claim the items, it was deemed suspicious. Therefore, yesterday morning at 10 AM, the police chief Han Shangying, together with the deputy chief of the traffic section Li Guan · and the stationmaster Zhou Binwu jointly opened the suitcases for inspection. The suitcases were found to contain 80 bags of red pills wrapped in cotton quilts, each bag containing approximately 1,000 pills. The other suitcase also contained 39 bags of red pills wrapped in cotton quilts, totaling 119 bags with 113,211 pills. The brand was "Nanyang Company Old Lion Horse Brand." There was also a bedroll, which contained no prohibited items. Because the case involved concealed prohibited poisonous red pills, the police section was not authorized to handle it. In addition to dispatching police to investigate, the 119 bags of red pills, totaling 113,211 pills, two suitcases, and a bedroll were sent to the Songhu Garrison Command for handling at 5 PM yesterday.</p>

<h3>Married Woman Sues for Division of Inheritance, Both Parties Should Present Relevant Evidence, Court Orders Out-of-Court Reconciliation, Reschedules Trial</h3>
<p>Yao Jingmin, a local woman, 21 years old, whose husband is Mr. Yin, currently the Chinese deputy head of the Public Concession Police Department, residing at No. 32, Lane 455, Jingzhou Road, through her lawyers Jiang Yiping and Li Gengxiang, filed a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the First Special District Court against her elder brother, Yao Shihao, requesting a division of their late father's inheritance. The lawsuit states that their late father, Yin Sheng, had four children: the defendant, Yao Shihao, the plaintiff, Yao Jingmin, Jingmei (female, 16 years old), and Shixiong (male, 14 years old). Yin Sheng passed away on the fourth day of the first lunar month of the 17th year of the Republic of China, leaving behind a residence on Huade Road, nine bungalows on Huishan Road, four acres and five tenths of land, one bungalow on McKinley Road, one acre and three tenths of land on Pingliang Road, two pieces of reclaimed land in Yinxiang Port, a piece of land in Zhenru, and joint ownership of land and savings, worth over 100,000 yuan. All of this is managed by her elder brother, Shihao, who has not divided it according to the law. Therefore, she is filing a lawsuit, requesting a division of one-fourth, totaling 25,000 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, the First Special Court Judge Peng presided over the hearing. Judge Peng first summoned Yao Jingmin to the case and questioned her about the facts of the lawsuit and her economic situation. Because the plaintiff had not paid the litigation fees, although she requested litigation assistance, observing the plaintiff's clothing and assessing her situation, she was not a person unable to pay the fees. Therefore, she was ordered to pay them. Then, Attorney Feng stated that Yao Shihao, 24 years old, from Shanghai, residing at No. 320 Huade Road, could not attend court today due to illness, and refuted the facts, stating that the houses and land listed in the plaintiff's statement did exist. However, the bungalows on Huishan Road were jointly owned with an uncle, and the land on Pingliang Road was his personal property. Therefore, the actual value of the property was only over 26,000 yuan. After deducting the grandmother's alimony, it was only 20,000 yuan. The plaintiff's one-fourth share was only 5,000 yuan. He also filed a counterclaim, requesting the deduction of 2,550 yuan taken by the plaintiff when she got married, and one-fourth of the 6,960 yuan owed for the grandfather's funeral and debts. Furthermore, the reclaimed land was jointly owned by the public and should not be divided. Yao Jingmin admitted that she did receive 2,550 yuan, but claimed that 2,000 yuan was given by her mother, Ms. He, as a loan that she had collected to buy wedding clothes, etc. The court stated that both parties should provide relevant evidence and adjourned the trial, ordering them to reconcile out of court.</p>
<h3>West Gate, 50th Anniversary of the Women and Children's Hospital, Hoping for Donations from All Sectors</h3>
<p>The Women and Children's Hospital in the West Gate, renowned as the "Red House," was established in 1885. This year marks its 50th anniversary, and a commemorative meeting will be held this Saturday. The hospital is the largest and oldest women's hospital in Shanghai, established initially with a donation of 5,000 yuan from Ms. McGregor Williamson. It started with a basic structure and has grown to its present state through 50 years of hard work and constant reforms. Its contributions to the Chinese people are truly significant. Although the hospital is most famous for its obstetrics department, its internal and external medicine departments are also highly skilled, with specialized physicians in charge of diagnosis and treatment. Since 1885, the number of patients treated by the hospital has exceeded 1.5 million, and over 1,000 babies are born at the hospital each year. Therefore, over the years, 40,000 babies have been born at the hospital. The hospital currently has three sections: one is the Shanghai Women's Medical College and the affiliated Nursing School, with an outpatient department on the ground floor that provides daily diagnosis and medication, which is extremely crowded. The second section is the obstetrics department with the latest equipment, and the third section is the internal and surgical department, which is well-organized, demonstrating the management's meticulous efforts and dedication. The hospital was established entirely for charitable purposes. Most patients only pay 50 cents per day, while the hospital's expenses amount to 2.5 yuan. Therefore, in addition to regular funding and external donations, the hospital must rely on income from private rooms. However, due to the poor market conditions, patients are tightening their expenses. Those who used to stay in private rooms are now staying in second-class rooms, and those who used to stay in second-class rooms are now staying in third-class rooms. As a result, the hospital's income has greatly decreased, and it must rely on external donations for support. Fortunately, there are many charitable individuals in all sectors who can take advantage of the hospital's 50th anniversary to generously donate. A donation of 1,000 yuan can provide two weeks of hospitalization for 15 impoverished patients, a donation of 500 yuan can provide one week of hospitalization for 15 patients, and a donation of 250 yuan can cover the expenses of 10 mothers in the hospital's obstetrics department. If 100 people each donate 100 yuan, it can offset the hospital's annual funding shortfall. Those who donate not only contribute to the development of this charitable cause but also bring blessings to themselves and safety to society. The names of donors of more than one yuan will be engraved on plaques for permanent commemoration.</p>
<h3>Journalists Association Statement, No Solicitation of Construction Donations from All Sectors, Anyone Encountering Imposters Should Be Immediately Handed Over for Investigation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Journalists Association recently received reports that unscrupulous individuals are using the name of the association to solicit funds for the construction of a clubhouse. The association convened an emergency standing committee meeting yesterday (the 7th) to discuss the matter and unanimously decided to thoroughly investigate it. In addition to sending personnel to investigate, the association also declares to all sectors that it has not solicited donations. Anyone encountering imposters should be immediately handed over to the police for investigation.</p>
<h3>American Lumber Prices to Increase</h3>
<p>The Damei Evening News reports that lumber importers in Shanghai have received letters and telegrams stating that the lumber workers' strike in the northwestern states of America is spreading widely. The American lumber export industry may be greatly affected. If so, the price of lumber in Shanghai may increase from US$2.50 per thousand board feet to US$3.00. It is estimated that the strike involves approximately 1,000 lumber mills in five states, with a total of 75,000 to 100,000 workers. They are demanding increased wages and shorter working hours, but have been unsuccessful. According to local lumber merchants, if the workers win this strike, the price of sawn lumber, which usually sells for US$5.00 per thousand board feet, may increase to US$7.50 or more. Therefore, the price in China will also increase accordingly. Although Canadian lumber can take advantage of this opportunity to promote sales, its price will also increase.</p>

<h3>Public Works Department Discusses Telephone Issues, Advocates for a Usage-Based System</h3>
<p>At the Public Works Department Board meeting on the 24th of last month, the Public Utilities Committee submitted a report on the discussions regarding telephone issues (committee meetings were held before the taxpayers' annual meeting). The minutes of the meeting were approved and recorded by the Board of Directors. The following is a summary of the contents of the minutes:</p>
<p>The current taxpayers (foreign nationals' annual meeting) passed a resolution requesting the Board of Directors to negotiate with the telephone company to postpone the price increase and to form a special committee to conduct investigations. However, the Public Utilities Committee had already considered the expert investigation and believed that hiring experts would be costly. Based on detailed research, it was known that the company's request was not excessive. Moreover, the company's operational efficiency was not a problem, so it seemed unnecessary. The franchise agreement between the Public Works Department and the company allows the company to earn a profit of one percent of the investment. The Public Works Department made a decision last month that if the French Concession authorities also agreed, the company would be allowed to increase prices from April 1 of this year, with a maximum increase of 12.5%. The Public Utilities Committee then convened a meeting to review the price list, changing the company's original proposed increase of 20.89% to 12.5%, and comparing the impact on users at all levels under the two plans. According to the company's report, commercial and residential telephones in Hong Kong cost 146.25 yuan per year, while in Shanghai, commercial telephones cost 146.85 yuan and residential telephones cost only 90.91 yuan. The former is equivalent, while the latter is 61% more expensive in Hong Kong. The Director of Finance proposed using a usage-based system, proposing to change the residential telephone fee from the originally planned 8 yuan to 8.5 yuan, with the minimum fee for commercial telephones remaining at 10 yuan, but presenting several levels of classification for usage-based calculation. The committee's discussion focused on how to evenly distribute the burden to be commensurate with the company's service. If a usage-based system is adopted, large users will bear more, while small and medium users will benefit more. The company had previously pointed out the economics of the usage-based system, stating that if the current level of communication continues unchanged, an additional capital of 3.5 million yuan is needed to purchase additional equipment. One committee member also said that the telephone fee calculation method should not be simplified by retaining the flat-rate system, but should be charged proportionally, as is the case with other public utilities. The company also stated in a letter that if the usage-based system is implemented and the number of calls is reduced by no less than half, it is willing to allocate all the profits to the telephone fee revision account for a period of one year. According to the General Manager's report, the former telephone company implemented a partial usage-based fee system in 1925. The former company also proposed to revise the telephone price and charge by usage in 1930. Mr. Ansen, an investigative expert hired in 1929, also advocated adopting a usage-based fee system or a tiered pricing system. When the committee met on April 1, it specially invited company representatives Bao De, Chuan Lan, and Fuli Chiman, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Yu Zuoting (accompanied by Xie Fusheng), and Mr. Windsor (bill broker) to attend the meeting. The Director of Finance stated that the usage-based system is now widely used and should be adopted in Shanghai, but the impact should be tested for at least one year before a decision can be made. Then, the company representatives described the advantages of the usage-based system, but temporarily planned to only apply it to commercial telephones. Since the introduction of automatic switchboards, the number of calls has increased sharply, requiring more equipment. If this continues unchanged, the burden on small users will inevitably increase. Currently, the average number of calls per line per day is 18.33. Therefore, the central station, which was originally designed for 10,000 lines, can now only handle 6,000 lines. After the initial implementation of the usage-based system, the company's revenue will decrease. However, in the long run, it is still worthwhile for both the company and small users. One committee member advocated that the flat-rate system should still be used, as it is more convenient; otherwise, users may decrease. The company representatives stated that the usage-based system is more fair. For example, if a certain family's communication needs suddenly decrease, it would be difficult to reduce fees under the flat-rate system. Also, the counters used by the company are extremely accurate and reliable. The partial use in the past year has been very satisfactory. Mr. Windsor stated that based on six years of research, he strongly advocates adopting a usage-based system, but there are still a few inconveniences to be resolved. The reduction in the number of calls may be about a quarter, and will not reach a half; the latter should not be used as a calculation standard. As for those who currently have five lines and make as many as 10,000 calls per month, and those who make more than 100 calls per day in businesses, accounting for one-fifth, this is too cheap. In short, the allocation of telephone fees should be carefully determined. Xie Fusheng, representing the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, spoke, requesting the Public Works Department to take into account the situation and keep the price increase as low as possible. Shanghai is different from other places, and the usage-based system should be considered carefully and implemented slowly. With the flat-rate system, everyone can predict how much they will pay, and it should not be compared to electricity and gas. The so-called abuse of telephones is an overstatement. When the committee met again, the company stated in a letter that assuming the number of calls will be reduced by 37.5%, a revised fee schedule is as follows: (1) Commercial telephones: 10 yuan per month for up to 150 calls, 3 cents for each additional call, 5 yuan for each additional line; (2) Residential telephones: 8.4 yuan; (3) Private dedicated lines: 2 yuan for every half-mile, 1 yuan for every tenth of a mile, 1 yuan per telephone; (4) Same (5) Socks, 50 cents each; (6) Installation and relocation are 10 yuan each; (7) Branch lines are 1 yuan each; (8) Private switchboards: 5 yuan for one line, 7 yuan for fifteen lines, 10 yuan for twenty-five lines, 12 yuan for thirty-six lines, 14 yuan for forty-seven lines, and 16 yuan for fifty-eight lines; (9) Reconnection fee: 2 yuan. According to the company's written opinion, excluding various unresolved issues, the company's net profit would still be no more than 9.22%. If the number of calls is reduced to 40%, the net profit will be less than 9%, but it seems to still be able to obtain 8%. In this way, only the general reserve fund company will suffer a slight loss of interest. However, the usage-based fee system is fair to users and avoids the hassle of revising the price list in the future. Moreover, this system is uniformly adopted by major cities, so it is willing to help the Public Works Department to realize it. As for the number of commercial machine calls, the company still estimates that it will decrease by 40% to 50%, because Chinese people often handle business outside of office hours and can use their home telephones. According to current predictions, about 40% of businesses will not increase their telephone bills or may even reduce them compared to the old system. Subsequently, the Director of Finance reported that the company's revised calculation basis seemed reasonable. The US income tax and the headquarters' management remuneration were not included, and the depreciation amount was reduced by 150,000 yuan. These issues will be resolved separately. According to experience elsewhere, it seems quite possible that the number of calls will be reduced by 37.5%, and the company can obtain a profit of 9.22% in the year before the end of March next year. The average increase in telephone fees is 11.09%. At that time, the committee decided not to put forward a specific proposal for the telephone case, as the taxpayers' annual meeting would propose a telephone case, and would discuss it later.</p>
<h3>Traveler in Ningbo Merchant Hotel Attempts Suicide by Poison</h3>

<h3>French Police Ban Rumors</h3>
<p>Recently, in the evenings, ignorant and idle people have been gathering near the Sino-French School in the Eight Immortals Bridge area, watching the red light on the school's glass windows.

The ignorant and foolish people have spread the rumors, believing them to be true.

<p>Special Report</p>
<h3>Bank of Communications Business Report (10)</h3>
<p>From the above observations, it can be seen that the Bank's efforts in agricultural investment this year are significant. Regarding rural lending, the former was handled indirectly in conjunction with various banks because the cooperative organization was not yet sound and the Bank's institutions had not penetrated the interior. The amount was not large. This year, branches in the Northwest, Qin, and Shaanxi have been successively established, and the organization of cooperatives has gradually become complete. The opportunity to start direct lending is complete. In addition to the Northwest branches actively lending to cooperatives, it is also planned to jointly establish the China-America Agricultural Loan Syndicate with the Shanghai JinCheng and Zhejiang Industrial Banks and other provincial farmers' banks. A head office will be set up in Shanghai, and offices will be set up in Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Hebei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other places. The main focus will be on cotton and wheat lending. The fund is tentatively set at five million yuan, shared by each bank according to its share. The syndicate will be established soon, and offices in various regions are also being planned separately. (6) Assisting National Goods Industry</p>
<p>In recent years, the national goods industry has gradually emerged. As a bank for developing industry, the Bank should allocate a portion of funds to provide practical assistance to this emerging industry. This year, larger domestic textile factories, dyeing factories, flour mills, sugar mills, paper mills, and chemical factories that are operating steadily but lack working capital are selected for lending more than in previous years. Regarding investment methods, in addition to striving for strict procedures and solid repayment funds, special attention is paid to the factory's operating income and expenditure.</p>
<p>(7) Promoting Transportation Construction</p>
<p>The Bank has a long history of relationship with the transportation industry. Since its reorganization into a bank for developing industry, it has realized the necessity of promoting transportation construction due to the interrelationship between transportation and industry. This year, it continued to follow this policy and make progress. On the one hand, it provides convenience of deposit, remittance, and exchange to completed projects, and on the other hand, it connects with other banks to jointly invest in uncompleted projects to promote their realization. In total, the amount of joint investment with various banks in transportation construction this year reached 70 million yuan, of which the Bank participated with an investment of more than 7 million yuan. In addition, the Bank's separately extended loans to local transportation authorities were not few.</p>
<p>(8) Promoting Cooperation Among Banks</p>
<p>In recent years, social and economic organizations have become increasingly complex, and the scope of banking business has also expanded. To adapt to the trend and jointly ensure safety, it is necessary to promote cooperation among banks. Significant progress has been made in actively pursuing this over the past year. In Shanghai, joint lending and lending with the Central and China Banks to rescue the market, and cooperation with various banks to handle rural loans. In Jinan, joint investment with the China and Shanghai Banks to jointly operate warehouses, and the establishment of lending conventions to be followed. In Wuhu, jointly leasing land on the riverside of Wuzha Road with the China and Shanghai Banks to set up public warehouses. In Hangzhou, the establishment of a clearing house with various banks and joint financing of silk and silk products. In Nantong, jointly building warehouses with the Bank of China. The uniformity of loan values and interest rates for supervised and secured loans, the public deliberation of railway bill of lading mortgages, and the prudent handling of procedures are all manifestations of the spirit of interbank cooperation.</p>
<p>(9) Improving Personnel Management</p>
<p>In recent years, the Bank has focused on investment in production enterprises, and its business scope has been increasingly expanded. Not only must there be a deep understanding of the situation of various industries, but specialized academic knowledge in factory management and manufacturing technology is also necessary to cope with. Considering that the Bank's branches are located all over the country, it is difficult to equip such talents in all locations. The head office has the responsibility of comprehensively overseeing the Bank's business and guiding and assessing the branches. It is appropriate to recruit talents to facilitate the facilities. Therefore, several commissioners have been transferred and assigned to four groups: cotton industry, salt industry, transportation industry, and economic research, to be responsible for investigation and design matters. At the same time, in view of the increase in the Bank's institutions and the shortage of existing personnel for deployment, various probationary employee regulations have been formulated, using screening methods and examination systems as the criteria for recruiting talents. Examinations have been held twice this year, and graduates have been selected from various universities once. All recruited employees have undergone rigorous training to seek further improvement.</p>
<p>All of the above have been implemented. How effective it is cannot be determined. At this time when world trends continue to evolve and the domestic economy is expected to improve, the continued improvement of the Bank's business depends on future efforts.</p>

<h3>Dutch East Indies Government Orders Chinese Schools to Prohibit Registration with the Ministry of Education and Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission</h3>
<p>(Batavia News) Chinese schools in the Dutch East Indies were originally restricted by the Dutch East Indies government's regulations on private schools. In view of the fact that various Chinese schools have registered with the Ministry of Education and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the National Government, the Dutch East Indies government recently issued an order to all Chinese schools prohibiting registration with government agencies in our country. The text is as follows: "The majority of private Chinese schools in the Dutch East Indies have been persuaded to register with Chinese government agencies and have registered. Regulations stipulate that those who promote Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People and Kuomintang believers will be recognized for registration. The basis for registration by the Chinese government is contrary to the principle of 'no politics in schools.' Because the registration regulations require the promotion of the Three Principles of the People and the hiring of teachers who can achieve this goal, I sincerely inform the Dutch East Indies government that it is forced to stop. All Chinese teachers and staff who have been registered with the Chinese government will be expelled from the territory of the Dutch East Indies. Because they are employed in Chinese government-registered Chinese schools, it is obvious that they want to promote the above-mentioned politics prohibited by the Dutch East Indies government in the schools. The above-mentioned items will be implemented in all Chinese schools three months later, or the teachers who will be teaching will be limited to three months. The school board affairs must state their attitude towards registration with the Chinese government. Regarding the statement that the registration with the Chinese government has been abandoned, evidence must be provided, which is the official document from the school board to the Chinese Ministry of Education or the Nanjing Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission." According to this, the education of overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies is about to be completely destroyed. It is hoped that the people of the country will protest and strive for it.</p>

<h3>After the Promulgation of the Degree Awarding Law, University Graduation Certificates Will Be Revised</h3>
<p>The Legislative Yuan passed the twelve articles of the Degree Awarding Law. After it was promulgated by the National Government, the Ministry of Education recently ordered it directly to all colleges and universities and the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities for compliance. Hu Shuhua, president of Hunan University, also telegraphed to inquire whether the word "Bachelor" should be filled in on the certificates of university graduates this summer. The Ministry of Education is currently reviewing and replying. However, it is found that the university graduation certificates that have been submitted by various provinces and cities to the Ministry of Education for inspection and printing in the past have the words "After completing the study period in a certain department and passing the examination, graduation is approved and may be called a certain Bachelor" in the certificate. According to the provisions of Article 3 of the now promulgated Degree Awarding Law, there is a statement that "Anyone who has studied in a public or registered private university or independent college, has completed the study period, has passed the examination, and has been reviewed by the Ministry of Education without objection, will be awarded a Bachelor's degree by the university or independent college." Therefore, the words "may be called" in the graduation certificate of university or independent college graduates in the future will be canceled and simply changed to "is a certain Bachelor." It is heard that the university graduation certificates before that will be revised, and new-style revised university graduation certificates can be implemented this summer.</p>

<h3>White Goose Art School Moves Into New School Building</h3>
<p>The White Goose Art School, affiliated with the renowned art organization the White Goose Painting Society, has suffered repeated fires in recent years, but it continues to struggle and strive tirelessly. Recently, it selected a building at No. 445 Gordon Road (intersection of Wuding Road) as its new school building and moved in on the 5th of this month. The location is quiet and ideal for studying art, and the transportation is very convenient, with buses and trams providing direct access. The facilities within the school are being gradually organized to achieve perfection. The former prosperity of the White Goose can be witnessed again today.</p>
<p>Special Article</p>
<h3>The Trend of the Chinese Cultural Movement</h3>
<p>(A Lecture by Yi Yuan)</p>
<p>The Chinese cultural movement, which has been interrupted for many years, has recently shown signs of revival due to the stimulation of national humiliation. In the past year, the waves of the cultural movement will move throughout the country, and on the increasingly depressed national psychology, it will also create a new response. If we can advocate properly, avoid repeating the same mistakes, be purely sincere, and not value superficiality, it may indeed be a major turning point in our nation's revival movement. I am ashamed of my insignificance, and last year I accepted an invitation to lecture at the Cultural Society. Due to the urgency of personal matters, I have not yet organized the lecture notes to seek correction from the wise and learned. Time flies, and suddenly it is the May Fourth period. At this time, my feelings are doubled, so I will restate the general idea in the hope of encouraging my fellow citizens.</p>
<p>For the past ten years, I have been working hard and diligently, living a simple and self-disciplined life. All my writings, directly and indirectly, have been aimed at promoting the development of the Chinese cultural movement. I dare not be different in my humble opinion, because culture is the expression of a nation's vitality and competitive power. From a holistic perspective, it is the total material and spiritual achievement of a nation in responding to and improving its environment and striving hard. In terms of its "use," it is an essential element for any nation seeking survival, development, and prosperity. Looking back at history and observing current events, the rise and fall, survival and death of all nations, the judgment of strength and weakness, superiority and inferiority, are all due to the prosperity or decline of their national culture. The reason why China's past history was brilliant and prosperous was due to the development of its culture. The reason why it is now declining and suffering misfortune is due to the decline of its culture. Although the Chinese nation has been conquered by foreign races in history, it has never been eradicated because of the victory of its culture. The reason why it has suffered humiliation from the great powers in the past century is due to the failure of cultural struggle. In the modern world, there is a phenomenon of those who follow the trend surviving and those who resist it perishing. This is the development of scientific culture. Japan initially did not understand this principle, so it was also oppressed by the great powers. After the Meiji Restoration, it quickly caught up and even surpassed them. Therefore, its politics, economy, military, and education were all able to generate powerful forces to compete with the European and American powers. Unfortunately, our people do not understand the principles of modern national survival, and they have completely lost their ability to create culture. They do not strive for self-improvement and rely on others in everything. They have no ability to create or improve any methods or necessities for national survival. This is the root cause of national decline and the summoning of national disaster. We must deeply understand this historical iron rule of national prosperity and decline and strive to develop national culture to strengthen and enrich national vitality.</p>
<p>However, what is the real effect of the cultural movement, which has been sensational for a while? This kind of doubt must be distinguished. The reason why the past cultural movement failed has its own undeniable mistakes. It is not possible to deny the true value of culture because of its mistakes. The reasons for the failure of the past cultural movement in our country can be divided into three points:</p>
<p>First, it was destructive - those who promoted the past cultural movement described their culture as new, but they did not know that the new is invisibly conceived in the old, and it is by no means a sudden emergence outside the old. Therefore, driven by emotional impulses, they blindly hated the "old," and everything old was to be destroyed. They blindly pursued the new, but the new ultimately broke away from the old and ran wild. As for what is new, the masses have no clear impression, how can they be new? The masses have no concrete way to create it, and the resulting abuses are that the advantages of our country's inherent culture have disappeared, and the so-called new culture is still nowhere to be found. This has caused great chaos in the spiritual world, and a gloomy and melancholy atmosphere fills the world. The impetuous are reckless and disregard right and wrong, and the cautious lose their principles. Alas, this is why the moral principles have been lost, and the hearts of the people are prone to chaos.</p>
<p>Second, it was blindly following - the past cultural movement was driven by emotions and blindly pursued the new. Therefore, those who peddled and imported into China, such as liberalism and communism, all failed to meet the needs of our nation. The pathological state of society, economy, and politics in recent years may be said to be the result of this kind of blindly following and anti-national cultural movement.</p>
<p>Third, it was superficial - Yang Xingfo once commented on the New Culture Movement, saying, "The New Culture itself has never been realized, and the New Culture Movement is even more of a fleeting dream that has long disappeared. Those who promote the New Culture Movement are all 'temporary performers who gather from all directions,' 'playing roles in a market,' and 'each showing their own talents.' After the gongs and drums are scattered, it is still a numb and indifferent society." Therefore, the result of the past cultural movement, although it was noisy on the surface for a while, did not actually promote society and enable the general public to benefit from it. In other words, there is still a huge distance between the ideals of the New Culture Movement and the national masses. To be more precise, the knowledge and skills of the national masses have not been improved or increased due to the cultural movement. This is what should be taken as a strong reflection and painful correction.</p>
<p>Learning from the past is the teacher of the future. Those who engage in the cultural movement today should first remember the lessons of the failure of the past cultural movement and accurately grasp the direction that the cultural movement should take today. Now, let us discuss it in detail:</p>
<p>First, it should be constructive - since the essence of culture is the expression of a nation's vitality and competitive power, the purpose of the cultural movement is not negative destruction, but lies in positive construction. Only engaging in destruction harms the nation's vitality, and only striving for construction can cultivate the nation's strength. This so-called construction has two aspects of meaning. Grasping reality and creating new systems are indeed things that construction should have. However, the review and preservation of the advantages of our country's inherent culture should also not be overlooked by those who are truly concerned about the cultural construction of our country.</p>
<p>Second, it should be self-aware - culture is to a nation what food is to the human body and medicine is to a patient. If you swallow it greedily and throw medicine indiscriminately, it will not only be useless to the body, but also enough to lose your life. The cultural movement of the Chinese past has committed this mistake. The nation's life is in danger, and careful recuperation is still uncertain. If you are not careful again, what could be more dangerous? Therefore, those who are engaged in the cultural movement today should be most alert to the fact that they must not repeat the same mistakes and repeat the mistakes of the past. Any foreign cultural relics, systems, doctrines, and theories only have their true value if they are in line with our national spirit, historical background, and social needs. It is also permissible to exert its function after it has been digested by our nation. This is also what those who engage in the cultural movement from now on should pay attention to and be aware of.</p>
<p>Third, it should be pragmatic - the past cultural movement failed to bridge the gap between the level of the masses and the social system. Therefore, the knowledge and skills of the general public have not yet reached the general level. This is why our country's cultural movement is nominally existing and has failed to promote group transportation. Those who engage in the cultural movement today should first try to eliminate the abuses of emptiness and shallowness, be down-to-earth, and go deep among the people to improve the actual lives of the national masses in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and increase their living ability. As for the political, economic, and social systems of a country, they should be properly and actively created. Extending this to the skills and tools of production of the people throughout the country, even the slightest improvement of a needle and a hoe for workers and farmers should be sought. It is necessary to ensure that all the people in the country, regardless of scholars, farmers, workers, businessmen, men, women, old, and young, can be deeply influenced by the waves of the cultural movement and benefit from it. This is also an essential point to pay close attention to.</p>
<p>In short, today's Chinese cultural movement should strive to avoid the past destruction, blindly follow, and repeat the superficial mistakes, and establish a new direction for it. It should move forward along the path of construction, self-awareness, and pragmatism in order to meet the needs of the nation, cultivate the nation's vitality, improve the intelligence of the national masses, and truly enhance the nation's strength to survive.</p>
<p>Moreover, all movements, the body of which is not our purpose, but only a method of promoting a certain purpose. Therefore, meetings, lectures, newspaper reports, and official announcements are only means of movement, not the purpose of movement. If the organizers of the movement only take meetings, lectures, newspaper reports, and propaganda as their ability, steal false fame, and forget the inherent purpose and true mission of their movement, or even neglect their daily duties, do not engage in their proper business, socialize, compete, and deceive the world with big words, then the nature of their actions is actually unbearable to hear. Then, all movements will only drive the masses to go down the wrong path of vanity, pride, and inferiority, and our great and pure nation will only become increasingly degenerate. Revival? Revival?</p>
<p>The fate of the country is in danger, and destruction is imminent. Worried about the times, I cannot help but say it in a heavy and detailed way. May the virtuous and heroic people of the world take my words and act on them, and I will be happy to be their humble follower.</p>

<h3>National Games Funding: National Government Subsidizes 70,000; The Shortfall Will Be Raised by the Shanghai Municipal Government</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 7th: The budget for the 6th National Games has been prepared by the Shanghai Municipal Government, totaling more than 120,000 yuan. Part of the funding was requested from the government as per usual practice. The Executive Yuan meeting on the 7th has resolved to subsidize 70,000 yuan. The Shanghai Municipal Government will be responsible for raising the remaining shortfall. Nanjing, 7th: The Executive Yuan meeting on the 7th has resolved to subsidize 70,000 yuan for the 6th National Games. According to Chu Minyi, speaking to the Central News Agency after the meeting, the budget for this year's National Games is 380,000 yuan. Assuming that the ticket sales for the Games will be 50,000, then the total budget is 330,000 yuan. However, a large part of the funding is for the construction of new stadiums and stands, so the amount completely used for the National Games is 150,000 to 160,000 yuan, which is an increase of about 20,000 to 30,000 yuan compared to the 5th National Games.</p>
<h3>Baseball League Second Game: Nanyang Defeats Shanghai University in a Landslide, Resulting in 20-0</h3>

As a result, Nanyang won a landslide victory with a score of 20-0. Nanyang's pitcher Li Beiliang and catcher Shi Shouchun were both very steady. First baseman Chen Gongyu and shortstop Liu Youzhang have promising baseball skills. The team's talent is average, so it was very easy to win. The Shanghai University team lacked practice, so they were defeated. But both sides were in high spirits. It is hoped that Nanyang will work hard in the future. When they face John's College next week, there will be a bloody battle. The scores of Nanyang and Shanghai University are recorded below:</p>

<h3>East Asia and Fudan Track and Field Competition Results</h3>
<p>Jia Lianren's 1500 meters in four minutes and twenty-two seconds, only four-tenths of a second off the national record.</p>
<p>For the sake of mutual learning and friendship, the track and field teams of the East Asia Physical Education College and Fudan University held a friendly competition at the Zhizhi College sports field on Shuidian Road at half past one yesterday afternoon. Jiang Xiangqing, Shen Kunnan, Dong Chengkang, Qu Yue, Chu Bomian, Wu Shijie, Zhou Jun, Hu Xidi, and others served as referees. Jia Lianren, a famous middle-distance runner from East Asia, focused all his energy on the 1,500 meters yesterday and completed the entire course in an excellent time of four minutes and twenty-two seconds, less than half a second off the national record (four minutes and twenty-one seconds and four-tenths). If someone were to compete with him, this old record would have long been broken. After a 45-minute break, he competed in the 800-meter race. Jia's physical strength was slightly diminished, and there were few competitors, so he only completed the race in two minutes and ten and a half seconds in a very natural manner. This person is of moderate build, full of vitality, and his future prospects are just beginning. He will surely display his great ambitions in the Double Tenth National Games. Zhou Shunsheng of East Asia's shot put of 12.06 meters, Li Zipu's javelin of 45.15 meters, and Jiang Huairen's triple jump of 12.90 meters were all quite good. Fudan's Qiu Guangxie's high jump has ample elasticity, but unfortunately, he only practiced twice this season, resulting in awkward movements, failing to attract attention from all parties. If he could put in a little more effort, he would definitely be able to dominate the country and not let Wu Bixian have all the glory. If you don't believe it, please wait and see what happens next. (According to general observations, with one month of practice, he should be able to achieve a score of 1.90 meters or more.) In terms of short distances, East Asia no longer has Su Xiaoru, who has already graduated, and Fudan also has no outstanding talents, so the results are particularly poor. However, overall, this competition was quite satisfactory. Fudan is preparing to go to Beijing tomorrow to participate in the Jiangda Sports Association Games. The complete results are listed below:</p>

<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Qian Yun)</p>
<p>Love and Luck</p>
<p>An insightful woman does not fall in love easily; an insightful woman, once in love, refuses to let go. Such a woman is certainly "lucky"; but "misfortune" often follows her closely.</p>
<p>A Wife Who Loves Firewood and Rice A woman who wants a divorce without firewood and rice will probably fall asleep as soon as she gets into bed. When her husband has plenty of firewood and rice, he will definitely put on airs, and this wife will definitely show a smiling face and be happy to accept it.</p>
<p>First Kiss</p>
<p>Pay attention to your first kiss, savor your first kiss, commemorate your first kiss. The first kiss is the most important, most prosperous, and most glorious page in your life history.</p>
<p>Men's Hearts Are Not Entirely Hard</p>
<p>Women often feel that men's hearts are terribly hard, but when they have their own will, what is so terrible about men's hearts being hard? Besides, men are certainly not all bad-hearted. Women can get real help from men who are not bad-hearted.</p>
<h3>Separation</h3>
<p>— Jiao Xin</p>
<p>"Living separation" has always been as sad as "death separation." But death cannot be reversed, while separation can be reunited. The most heartbreaking thing is when you are healthy when you leave, but when you come back, you are already in a coffin.</p>
<p>Don't resent the sadness of separation, you must know that without the sad separation, where would the sweet reunion come from!</p>
<p>In childhood, one is reluctant to leave one's parents, in youth, one is unwilling to leave one's lover, and in old age, one sheds tears for the separation of one's children.</p>
<p>When separating, one resents the train or ship for not stopping for a moment longer; when returning, one resents the train or ship for not leaving faster.</p>
<p>The scene of waving hats and scarves in farewell at the station and wharf is the most desolate, so I often say that people who work at the station and wharf are emotionally numb if they are unmoved by this scene.</p>
<p>One who hangs one's head alone, dejectedly, and walks away from the station alone is definitely the one who has just said goodbye.</p>
<p>Liu Bei's felling of trees to send Xu Shu off was certainly because of his deep affection, but I say that half of it was still the tactics he used.</p>
<p>Wu Shang suffered misfortune together with his father because he was thinking of meeting his father. If he had listened to his younger brother at that time, he would not have died, and his father would not have lost his life. Although separation and reunion are small matters, emotions must be restrained by reason.</p>
<h3>Funny Stories About Pickpockets</h3>
<p>— Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>Speaking of pickpockets, it can be said that they are famous all over the world. No matter who they are, they have a considerable understanding of them, or many readers may have been pickpocketed by them! Especially at ship docks, train stations, and lively theaters and amusement parks, these places are where these people gather. Therefore, traveling passengers and spectators at lively venues are always at risk of being pickpocketed.</p>
<p>It is said that pickpockets also undergo training. The things they pickpocket must wait three days before they can be exchanged, because they are afraid that the loser is a "big shot." Then the things pickpocketed still have to be returned to him. Was it Wang Hu? When he was the governor of Jiangsu Province, he was once patronized by pickpockets. Or it was when he had just arrived in Nanjing and had not yet taken office, because his clothes were very simple, so the pickpockets actually mistook him for an "old man" and pickpocketed his leather suitcase. So, this Governor Wang was furious, immediately summoned the police chief to scold him, and set a deadline to recover the original items. Within a few hours, the stolen goods and the thief were caught. Not knowing Mount Tai with their eyes, no wonder they touched bad luck!</p>
<p>Everyone knows that pickpocketing is a secret activity, but Soviet Russia has a kind of public pickpocket, this kind of pickpocket sometimes acts as an international pickpocket, and the local government uses them to investigate passengers. Although this does not check passengers on the surface, it is actually more severe than checking. Of course, this kind of pickpocket - actually a thief - has a monthly salary and is protected by the government, which can really make our country's pickpockets envious!</p>

<h3>Water Prison is Better Than Hell</h3>
<p>— Qi Zhong</p>
<p>In this publication, there was previously an article by Mr. Defu, "Water Prison," saying that those who work as back scrubbers in bathhouses are immersed in water vapor all day long, and their suffering is more bitter than the "blacksmith, boatman, and tofu grinder," which are generally regarded as the most bitter occupations. Therefore, they - the back scrubbers - are said to be in a water prison. Yes, back scrubbing is indeed more bitter than the occupations of blacksmithing, boating, and tofu grinding. Because blacksmiths seem to suffer the punishment of burning in summer, but in winter, because there is fire to drive away the cold, they can finally live a few happy days; boatmen, although they drink the northwest wind in the cold winter, they also live a few days of poetic life on summer nights with a bright moon and clear wind; as for tofu grinding, now because of the development of science, many have used electricity and do not need to work late at night; even if they work late at night, they also have to sleep during the day, which is certainly better than back scrubbing friends immersed in water vapor. But I think that people in the water prison, although suffering, are not as bitter as those in hell. The so-called people in hell are those who work in hell, that is, miners. Miners walk into the pit to mine, and the pit is unusually dark, which can be regarded as entering the hell where they cannot see the sun. Moreover, the air in the pit is unusually turbid and very humid, so the miners' bodies are not only weakened because they cannot get clean air, but also mostly suffer from damp diseases. They walk into the pit to work, and often have to spend half a month before they can come to the ground to see the sun, which is tens of thousands of times different from the back scrubbers who can walk outside the bathhouse door every day! Back scrubbers can smoke a cigarette when they are tired, but miners cannot at all. Unfortunately, if the ground collapses, the miners will be buried alive in hell, and there is no way to escape. Therefore, when the mining workers enter the pit to work, they also have the heart to sacrifice their lives. If they work for half a month and then return to the ground, it is like being reborn, so they must indulge in prostitution and drinking to be happy. Because their suffering is tens or hundreds of times more bitter than that in the water prison, and their workplace is underground, it is certainly no one will object to calling the mine a hell!</p>

<h3>Japanese Wooden Clogs</h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>Living in Japan, no matter where you are, you can always hear the clacking sound of wooden clogs. Especially when a Japanese woman wearing wooden clogs walks on the cement sidewalk, the sound is clear and crisp, arousing a strange emotion. In ancient times, people in our country also wore wooden clogs when climbing mountains and enjoying the snow. Now, in the countryside of the mainland, or perhaps some people still wear self-made wooden clogs on rainy days. Japanese wooden clogs, generally called "Geta," come in many varieties. No country in the world has boots that are the same as Japan's. So, it is not impossible to say that "Geta" is a representative of Japan.</p>
<p>"Geta" are divided into two types: those with teeth and those with flat bottoms. Both have two straps on top, which fasten the toes. The place where the two straps cross is where they are embedded in the gap between the big toe and the second toe. When it gets cold, they wear a special kind of short socks called "Tabi," which are sewn from a single or double layer of cloth. They are very much like a sock, with the big toe and the other toes separated, so they can clamp the straps of the "Geta." Men's socks are all black, and women mostly wear white or other colors, but there are no patterns.</p>
<p>Farmers wear "straw sandals" when cultivating in the fields. The style is similar to what rickshaw pullers in our country wear, and there are also ropes to fasten the heels. Ordinary "Zori" are different again. They are not made of straw, but are woven from very thin grass whips. The value is slightly more expensive, with wealthy products costing tens of dollars a pair. Like Zori, there are also two types made of wood and cork. The wooden ones have lacquer and beautiful patterns on top and are especially for women.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of "Geta" worn on sunny days, with names such as "Koma Geta" and "Hiyori Geta." These clogs have very short teeth and are made of a whole piece of wood, sometimes with a piece of leather added to prevent mud. The ones worn by women mostly have leather of various colors to protect the feet, usually red and green. Modern women also wear wooden clogs, which look very much like the sole of a high-heeled leather shoe. There is also a kind of wooden clog with a missing part at the bottom, which makes a shell-shell-shell sound when walking, mostly worn by underage girls. Ordinary wooden clogs cost more than half a yuan and can be used for more than a year.</p>
<p>Wooden clogs without lacquer are no different for men and women. The five-color straps are mostly used by men and women over middle age. Wooden clogs are all made of paulownia wood, which is soft and light. Rubber is often nailed on the teeth to reduce noise, which shows that the Japanese themselves also feel that the sound of walking is too loud. Japanese homes are all covered with mats, which are unusually clean. Whenever you return home, you have to take off your "Geta" and walk into the room with socks on. In larger homes, you also have to change into slippers, walk through the passage, and then take off your slippers and enter the room with socks on. In the past, Japan did not have slippers, so they were called "Slippers." Chinese people do not have the habit of changing shoes, so they all complain endlessly when they first arrive in Japan.</p>
<p>Nowadays, many Japanese wear leather shoes and suits, and many modern women wear high-heeled shoes. For the sake of easy putting on and taking off, they buy very large sizes, and the shoelaces are also fastened very loosely. In addition, having been accustomed to dragging wooden clogs, even if they wear leather shoes, they still drag them, which is extremely funny. Japanese galoshes are often sold in our country's markets, but the Japanese do not wear them. There is another kind of long galoshes there, which are like army boots, costing more than two yuan, but very few people wear them. There is a kind of rubber-soled black cloth quick boots, which are worn by workers and rickshaw pullers.</p>
<h3>Small Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Episode 12 Ashamed of having no clothes, avoiding each other behind curtains, diligently saving lamp oil, copying books at dawn</p>
<p>I now have a small ambition, planning to invite some comrades to edit textbooks with local characteristics, as well as books for adult education. Think about it, letting people in their twenties receive children's education, and letting an editor from Jiangnan tell people on the Northwest Plateau about the social conditions of Jiangnan in books, how can that be appropriate? Zhou Yourong raised his head back to the roof, sighed a long breath, and then said to Zhizhiqian: Mr. Cheng, you are a person with a heart. But what's the use? For example, I, although not a virtuous official, am at least not a corrupt official, but I was driven away by the Eighth Master. All the plans I had for being a county magistrate were useless, I just raised military pay with people for more than half a year. After speaking, he sighed again. Zhizhiqian said: Now the military men in various provinces are somewhat enlightened, and politics may be on the right track one day soon... Zhou Yourong reached out and wiped his face vigorously, indicating that he would cancel what he had just said, and smiled: Don't mention me, let's talk about yours. After talking for a long time, you are all talking about the student's side, what about the teacher's side? Zhizhiqian thought for a moment and smiled slightly: We are all guests in Shaanxi, and there are still some things that we cannot understand clearly. About this, please let our old brother report it. He has relatives who teach in the interior, and he can report some materials. Saying that, he looked at Wang Beihai. Before he spoke, he sighed, as if what he was about to say was another sad article. (199)</p>
<h3>Misty Records of Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>One morning, when we were all ready to go to the early court with the Empress Dowager, suddenly a eunuch rushed in in a panic, with a kind of terribly solemn look on his face, as if he was afraid of missing something important: he hurriedly brought a report.</p>
<p>"Old Buddha!" He shouted on the ground, excited like a monkey, "This servant just saw that Hei Baoyu has given birth to four puppies, so I rushed to report it."</p>
<p>As soon as the Empress Dowager heard this, a light of joy immediately flashed in her eyes. The "Hei Baoyu" mentioned here is the name of a dog: dogs are something the Empress Dowager loves, or at least it can be said that it is one of the many things that the Empress Dowager loves. Since she loves dogs, she naturally wants to raise dogs, but her raising dogs is very different from ordinary people; she regards this matter as very important and does not neglect it at all. She specially asked people to collect many books that discuss how to choose dog breeds, how to allocate feed, and how to train puppies, and other specialized technical books, for her to read and study in her spare time, so it can be said that none of her dogs are not of clear pedigree and long-standing reputation.</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager also asked me if I had any interest in the animal dog? I told her that I also liked dogs like her; this is the truth, I still like dogs very much! And those dogs I saw at the Empress Dowager's place that day, especially felt precious and cute, most of them are real Beijing small breed dogs, their heads and noses are very short, but their fur is not uniform, there are various colors.

<h3>Finance Spring Racing Season Mid-Term, Bullish Trend in Bullion Bidding</h3>
<p>Public Sentiment Stimulated by Spot Market, Results in Further Increase of 6.6 Yuan</p>
<p>The gold market has recently been flourishing due to public sentiment being stimulated by the spot market. Yesterday, it continued to rise. However, because the foreign exchange market was inconsistent, it was strong at first but then weakened. Due to the Spring Racing season, trading was only conducted for half a day as usual, so the market situation was quite calm. In the early morning, during the mid-term of the closing period, overseas calls indicated that both the British and American silver markets and forward silver prices had risen slightly, but the amount was very small, and public sentiment was not affected. The pre-market trading closed and immediately rose to 87.8 yuan. Due to a lack of supply, it broke through the 90 yuan mark. Although there was a reversal after entering, the Central Bank's listing was announced. The pound was flat and the US dollar rose, and the customs gold unit increased by one li. The standard price of bullion bidding rose to 828.7 yuan. Public sentiment reversed to become bullish, causing a further rise. The morning opened with high prices and remained stable after opening. However, the foreign exchange market was inconsistent, and banks rushed to sell. HSBC's listing also remained unchanged, gradually retreating within the 90 yuan mark. Major players aggressively bought at lower prices, and HSBC also quickly placed orders, causing a temporary rebound. However, banks continued to sell, and sellers actively traded at higher prices. The Guangdong banking group sold bars in unison, temporarily halting the upward trend, and then retreated within the 90 yuan mark. However, due to major players still coming in to replenish their positions, banks slightly bought at cheap prices, which helped maintain the price. The announcement of the market closure had already been made public, and the market lacked special supply and demand, so the market situation turned calm, with narrow fluctuations. The market situation was mostly sideways, and public sentiment had not turned bearish. The underlying trend was still promising, leading to a stable closing. The half-day market situation was stable. Although there was much fluctuation in the middle, the future held a hidden upward trend. Due to spot market conditions, the swap spread narrowed to five yuan yesterday. After recording the half-day market situation today:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 793.7 yuan, a further increase of 8.5 yuan compared to before the close. Yuanchangyong, Shenkang, and Fuyu accepted bars, rising to 4.5 yuan. Banque Sino-Belge released June US dollars at 75, and Fuxingyong, Dadecheng, and Wanxing sold at 3 yuan. Hengyu, Fuyu, Huixiang, and Fuxingyong even reached 5 yuan. Yingxiang, Yongli, Hengyu, Dadecheng, Yifengyong, Dacheng, Jiarun, and Wanxing sold them off. The foreign exchange market was not satisfied. Mitsui released June sterling at 1875, plus the prior knowledge that HSBC's listing would not change, and retreated within the 90 yuan mark, falling to 89 yuan. Huixiang worked hard to accept bars, rising to 90 yuan. Hengyu, Hengchangyong, and Qianchangxiang sold again at 88.7 yuan. Shanghai and HSBC bought spot sterling at 375 and June at 25. Huixiang, Hengyu, and Changda rushed in, rising back to 92.5 yuan. After fluctuating, Huixiang and Changda advanced to 4 yuan. Banque Sino-Belge released June US dollars at 8125, and Qianchangxiang, Wanxing, Dadecheng, Shengda, and Hengxing took the opportunity to sell off, reducing to 90 yuan. Yixiang still advanced to 1.7 yuan. Mitsui released July US dollars at 6875, Hengyu and Hengxing sold to 89.7 yuan, and Hengyu, Hengxingyuan, and Huixiang took the opportunity to buy at low prices up to 91.9 yuan.

After entering, Yicheng, Hengyu, and Dafayong once advanced to 2.3 yuan. Zhejiang and MacKay sold July US dollars at 6875, and Hongxing and Hengyu sold at high prices, reducing to 0.6 yuan. Fuxingyong and Hongkangyong still accepted, slightly replenishing their short positions, and rose again to 2.1 yuan. After fluctuating, the midday closing was 791.8 yuan. After the close, although Hengyu and Yuanyi sold to within 1 yuan, Fuxingyong, Fuyu, Hengyu, and Houchangyong all held firm, and finally rose to around 2 yuan. It was found that the highest price during the half-day was 795 yuan, and the lowest price was 789.7 yuan, a fluctuation of 6.3 yuan. As a result, it rose by another 6.6 yuan compared to before the close. The market was closed in the afternoon due to the Spring Racing season.</p>
<p>The closing price was announced as 828.7 yuan for the Central Bank's standard bullion price, about 37 yuan weaker than the closing price, about 6 yuan less weak than last Saturday. The registration price for this month was 799 yuan, and for June was 792 yuan. The supplemental water in the morning was 799 yuan, and the price of pure gold was about 13 yuan higher, at 806.7 yuan. The spot market situation was stable. Tianjin goods were about 16.25 yuan higher, sold by the Tianjin banking group to Yingfengheng for 700 taels, and Dafengheng and Tongfengheng each for 350 taels. As for pure gold, it was sold by Yingfengheng to smaller silver shops, 19 yuan and 20 yuan higher. Due to spot market conditions, the swap premium was slightly weak. Tongfengheng paid Huiyuan 49 bars at 7.6 yuan, Huiyuan paid Shenkang 49 bars at 6.5 yuan, Fuxingyong paid Renfayong 70 bars at 5.5 yuan, and also paid Yingfengheng 70 bars at 5 yuan.

<h3>Uneven Bank Supply and Demand, Foreign Exchange Market Results in Slight Tightening</h3>
<p>After the foreign exchange market was closed for one day the day before yesterday, overseas calls in the past two days indicated that London's large cables rose by 1875 each for near and far terms, New York silver prices rose by half a point, and the Montreal forward silver market also rose by 2 li to 5 li. London's raw gold rose by one and a half pennies, the pound against the US dollar shrank by 375, the pound against the French franc rose by 2 pounds, the US dollar against the pound rose by 1.25 points, and the US dollar against the French franc rose by a small half point.

Public sentiment was positive and trending tight. The Central Bank's listing was announced, with the pound flat and the US dollar rising by 125 points, and the customs gold unit rising by 1 li. After opening, banks rushed to sell at high prices, gradually returning to flat. HSBC's listing was announced, with both the pound and the US dollar flat, and public sentiment had also stabilized. Banks had uneven appetites for buying and selling. However, because HSBC once bought, it was still good, and banks still sold when responsible. China also slightly sold, still showing calm. Finally, although public sentiment was good, there was still a supply from banks, and it still fluctuated, with the trend being extremely mediocre. The midday closing selling price for the near-term British exchange was 1 shilling 8 pence 3125, and the US exchange rate was 41 yuan, which was slightly tighter for both British and US exchanges compared to before the close. Banks had uneven appetites for buying and selling, with HSBC buying sterling and the Bank of England selling. The Bank of China slightly sold US dollars, and Chinese merchants had some arbitrage.

<h3>Limited Silver Settlement During the Spring Racing Season</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the Western merchants' Spring Racing season. As usual, foreign banks closed in the afternoon. Although Chinese accounting houses settled as usual, it was similar to a normal Saturday. The settlement of various remittances and collateral was ultimately minimal, resulting in a sluggish situation. The interbank lending rate in the market was still 1.2 fen.

Yesterday's subsidiary currency market was also unusually calm. The price of small Tinnan silver dollars was 834.5 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, a slight increase of 5 jiao compared to the previous day, with only 3,000 jiao of transactions in the early market. There was no news in the market.

<h3>Securities Bond Market Lacks Confidence from Both Bulls and Bears</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market of the Chinese Securities Exchange saw no significant changes. Trading was relatively active, but the 96 contract's activity declined, the trend remained sideways, still in a period of incubation. Various syndicates are taking a wait-and-see attitude, wanting to take action only after the market moves. The market became sluggish. Bulls thought the market price was too high, waiting for a small correction before buying again. Shorts thought the market was too stagnant, and taking a loss on the swap, so they were unwilling to take bold actions. Without fresh troops joining the line, the positions of both bulls and bears are not easily shaken. The 96 contract returned up after a small correction, but still failed to break through 9 yuan. The bulls' recent concern is the identification of counterfeiting, so most are unwilling to take delivery this month. The shorts currently show no signs of covering. If it cannot break through 9 yuan again and return near 8 yuan, it is not impossible. Yesterday, swap transactions were slightly more active, seemingly with more bulls turning into swaps. The near-term market price was lower than the far-term, with sales still raising by 1 jiao to 3 jiao. The 96 contract also returned up about 2 jiao. The total number of transactions was 5.79 million, with the 96 contract estimated at 2.355 million yuan. The result of its rise and fall is compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3>Pension Fund Case Ruling, New York Stock Market Still Soft</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported: Although the US Supreme Court ruled yesterday (6th) that the railway workers' pension fund case was unconstitutional, the stock market was still mixed with softness. The court's ruling had no impact on the market, as this matter had long been anticipated, and the market had already discounted it. Proponents of the pension fund law claimed that they intended to draft other new laws, causing speculators to feel uneasy. At the same time, the market rose under the leadership of railway bonds as a result of the pension fund case ruling. Stocks on small exchanges were still firm. The total daily trading volume was 1.03 million shares. The Dow Jones New York index is listed below: 4th 6th</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 20.83 110.53 Down 0.30</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Auction Market Initially Firm, Then Weakened</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to be stable. Due to the good sales in the spot yarn market and the strong demand from the Guangdong banking group, public sentiment became more consolidated, attracting those who had profited to cover their short positions. However, new buyers still lacked interest, as a certain merchant still had to settle 100-200 bales this month.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Covering Short Positions</p>
<p>In the opening of the yarn auction market, the near-month market atmosphere was still stagnant, the situation was scattered, and most were bearish. However, a portion, because the base was already dry, did not show a strong intention to sell, so the trading in the market became even more deserted. Short sellers in the market, seeing the situation as fixed, moved to cover their positions. As a result, each month rose by 2, 3, 4, and 5 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening was firmer. Because the spot yarn sales were still around 1,400 bales, with the Henan and Guangdong banking groups purchasing the most, the atmosphere became slightly tighter. However, when shooting to the closing, it suddenly turned weak, because Yuda sold out, and the market suddenly loosened. Each month fell back by 2 and 3 jiao, indicating that public sentiment was still frustrated. As a result, each month rose or fell by 1 and 2 jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Dafeng sold 350 bales, Suilong sold 350 bales, Taichang sold 350 bales, Changfeng sold 1,500 bales, Yuda sold 1,150 bales, Deji sold 400 bales, Changji sold 450 bales, Runkang sold 600 bales, and Hengchang sold 550 bales. Those who bought included Tongji with 350 bales, Hexing with 300 bales, Xiesheng with 350 bales, Xincheng with 750 bales, Yida with 450 bales, Dafeng with 350 bales, and Yongchang with 600 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices of the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Auctioned Yarn Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Change Compared to Previous Day's Balance</p>
<p>May Contract 174.3 173.9 174.3 Up 0.40 35,650</p>
<p>June Contract 176.1 175.4 176.1 0.30 37,600</p>
<p>July Contract 177.0 176.5 176.8 0.20 42,150</p>

<p>October Contract 178.3 177.7 178.1 0.20 21,500</p>
<p>Total 189,150</p>
<p>Henan and Guangdong Banking Groups Purchasing Spot Goods</p>
<p>The sales of spot yarn are still considered smooth. It was found that the actual purchases by various groups throughout the day totaled 1,545 bales, and the market situation was similar to the previous day. The purchase amount of each group is as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 685 Changsha 35 Shantou 45</p>
<p>Inland 105 Weihaiwei 15 Northern Banking Group 50</p>
<p>Xuzhou 60 Henan 500 Jiangxi 10</p>
<p>Haizhou 15 Fujian 3</p>
<h3>Drought in Northern Regions, Cotton Bulls Stand Firm</h3>
<p>The cotton market has recently been firming up day by day, and the buying atmosphere on the market is relatively strong. This is actually because cotton merchants are optimistic, and the pulling force is particularly strong. It is said that the inventory of various factories is not strong, and it has fallen by 4-5 yuan compared to the high price. Moreover, in the North China area, the weather is too dry, and it is difficult to cultivate new cotton. However, Western merchants have been selling short in October, exceeding 10,000 bales.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao's Chips Showing Signs of Exhaustion</p>
<p>In the opening of the cotton auction market, each month was flat. However, US cotton trended down, and Indian cotton and British Royal Memorial markets were closed, but the market price of bullion slightly rose. When shooting to the third round, the market price gradually rose as the number of floating shorts were too large. When the floor tightened, buyers increased. Recently, the weather in the north has been dry for a long time without rain, which is particularly unfavorable to new cotton. Public sentiment is particularly firm. As a result, each month rose compared to the previous day's closing price.</p>
<p>Jiao to Erjiao, the afternoon opened still strong. Gengfeng came to cover the short position again, the number of chips on the floor was exhausted, and the bulls were standing still, each month rose again by Jiao to Yijiao Ban. However, until the time of closing, the yarn market turned soft, the demand from the factories was not strong, and the overseas cotton market news was bearish. Each month fell back by Yijiao Ban. As a result, the current month rose Jiao compared to the morning price, and the distant months were not moved. It was found that Dafeng sold 1,600 bales, Meiji sold 4,300 bales, Senkang sold 900 bales, Yongda sold 1,100 bales, Mingde sold 1,400 bales, Runkang sold 1,700 bales, Changhe sold 1,300 bales, and Yugang bought 1,400 bales, Dafu bought 1,500 bales, Tongji bought 1,500 bales, Jinchang bought 2,200 bales, Hexing bought 3,100 bales, Shenchang bought 1,000 bales, Changfeng bought 1,600 bales, Gengfeng bought 4,100 bales, and Yuanxingchang bought 1,500 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices of the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Yarn Prices Not Rising, Factory Needs</p>
<p>Strengthen</p>
<p>The sales of spot cotton are extremely sluggish. Various factories use less raw materials due to the yarn prices not rising. The source is estimated to be 850 bales of Tonghua and 2,000 bales of Yaohua.</p>
<p>Shashi Cotton 42.25 Hengda Factory enters 150 pieces Spot goods sent to the factory</p>
<p>Yaohua 30.65 Yongan Factory enters 400 bales Also Stack Exchange</p>
<p>Shanghai Tip 41.50 Shenxin Factory enters 100 bales Also Sent to the factory</p>
<p>Zhengzhou Fine Velvet 43.15 Shenxin Factory enters 13 pieces Also</p>
<h3>US Cotton Bulls Settle, Prices Retreat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened without much fluctuation. The market situation was quiet and firm due to the scarcity of sellers and the tight spot market. However, spot demand was sluggish, so it formed a sideways trend. There was heavy rain in the central area, which was unfavorable for cotton harvest. Unfortunately, the drought-stricken area received rain, lacking any attractive power. Later, the July bulls settled, and the public sold, causing the market situation to turn weak. It was widely rumored in the market that Joan will issue a statement tomorrow. The exchange estimates that the worldwide cotton consumption from August 1 to March 31 will be 17,044,000 bales, compared to 17,109,000 bales in the same period last year. The closing was flat and weak, with spot falling by 15 points, and futures falling by 7 to 15 points. British and Indian cotton were both closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 7th):</p>
<p>US Cotton Compared to the previous Jiao Equivalent to National Currency</p>
<p>5 2.74 Down 14 31.80</p>
<p>7 2.75 15 31.90</p>
<p>10 2.49 10 30.90</p>
<p>12 2.55 10 31.10</p>
<p>1 2.60 10 31.30</p>
<p>3 2.69 7 31.60</p>
<p>Spot 12.15 15 32.70</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for white cotton in the July-August period on the 7th was 237 rupees, a decrease of 1.75 rupees compared to the previous day's closing.</p>
<h3>Final Revised Estimate of National Cotton Production in the 23rd Year</h3>
<p>The China Cotton Production Statistics Association announced the final revised estimate of national cotton production in the 23rd year as follows:</p>
<p>Cotton field area 44,971,264 mu</p>
<p>Ginned cotton production 11,201,999 dan</p>
<p>Abandoned field area 664,140 mu</p>
<p>This estimate is based on (1) the final total report of Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, eleven provinces, and Shanghai and Tianjin, reviewed and compiled, (2) 60 square zhang per mu, 100 jin per dan. The first estimate for the 23rd year was announced on August 20, the second estimate was announced on December 15. The revised estimate is compared with the two estimates and the revised estimate for the 22nd year below:</p>
<p>Cotton Field Area (mu) Ginned Cotton Production (dan)</p>
<p>Revised estimate for the 23rd year 44,971,264 11,201,999</p>
<p>Second estimate for the 23rd year 44,807,579 11,172,553</p>
<p>First estimate for the 23rd year 44,441,047 10,497,924</p>
<p>Revised estimate for the 22nd year 40,454,023 9,774,207</p>
<h3>Grains: Wheat Futures Influenced by Weather</h3>
<p>Hence the Initial Rise, then Fall</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market opened higher in the morning, then fell. Foreign wheat was quoted with Chicago up 8 to 10 points, while Canadian wheat was not trading. After the opening price, due to the remaining momentum from the previous day's strong flour sales, sentiment was quite bullish. Bids for all months were up about 2 points. Later, various factories, noting the decline in forward flour prices and extremely favorable weather, softened their stance, falling back 1 to 2 points from the initial opening. In the afternoon session, the market for all months fluctuated, still with a loosening trend. Because the weather was favorable, there seemed to be indirect speculation about the prospects for new wheat, and the weariness in sentiment was related to the seasonal factors. In the end, July was down 1 point, September was down 1 point, and the rest were unchanged. The spot wheat market remains active, with prices stable. High-quality wheat bids were up 2 points because while arrivals continued, sales were also brisk. Opening prices were: Suzhou wheat at 4.023 yuan, Henan wheat at 3.97 yuan, Bengbu wheat at 3.99 yuan, Jiangbei wheat at 3.91 yuan, and Zhumadian wheat at 3.81 yuan. Xinxin took away 1,500 bags, Fufeng took away 1,000 bags, and Xinda took away 4,000 bags.</p>
<p>The outlook for overseas spring wheat is quite good. There is no pressure on old wheat months, and the market seems to be fluctuating. Last week, supply was seen to decrease by 2,068,000 bushels.</p>
<p>Chicago</p>
<p>Wheat  4th 6th Up/Down</p>
<p>July 96.25 96.500 Up 0.250</p>
<p>September 96.75 96.875 Up 0.125</p>
<p>Spot No market 104.00</p>
<p>Canadian Wheat</p>
<p>July 89.00 No market</p>
<p>Spot 87.50 Ditto</p>
<h3>Flour Also Affected by New Wheat</h3>
<p>—Imagining a Bountiful Wheat Harvest—</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market opened in the morning, initially stable, then near-term contracts firmed while distant contracts fell. Foreign wheat was quoted with Chicago up 8 to 10 points, while Canadian wheat was not trading. When opening, because sales to the Beiyang merchants were weak this month, factories had to mill and pack goods in batches. Therefore, sentiment gradually improved. The initial opening for distant months, due to recent conditions, had risen about 1 point. After the second session, the market for this month remained tight, rising to 4.48 yuan. For April and later months, because of favorable weather and many manufacturers and speculators aggressively selling, the market gradually declined. In the afternoon session, the trend for all months continued to loosen. This month, because the merchants had stopped, also retreated slightly. The long-term history is one of gentle breezes and warm weather, and it softened again. As for the Beiyang merchants' continued actions, half is because grain prices are also high, and flour stocks in various places are not thick. Now, in the lean season, there is a phenomenon of seeking. In the end, this month was up 7.5 li, June was down 2.5 li, July was down 7.5 li, August was down 1.25 fen, September was down 0.5 fen, and October was down 0.75 fen.</p>
<h3>Red Grains Gradually Rising</h3>
<p>Sesame Has Abundant Inventory</p>
<p>Yesterday's soybean market did not have much change. However, trading in the market was relatively active, with a total of 6,000 to 7,000 bags of various beans traded. Factories and domestic merchants were buying, so some people were bullish. The corn market should stabilize. Sales of red grains to the Dongyang merchants are not new, and domestic demand is also consistent, so the market is gradually rising. Yesterday, Guide grain opened at 3.39 yuan, with over 300 bags traded. Haozhou grain was one cart, priced at 1.91 yuan. Bengbu grain was one cart, priced at 2.88 yuan. Xikou grain was over 100 bags, priced at 3.10 yuan. After foreign sesame was imported by Jardine Matheson, Pao Lung, Sassoon, etc., with 1,000 tons of clean goods (priced from 8.83 to 8.85 yuan), there has been no market in recent days due to the British merchants' holiday celebrations for many days. The market for raw goods has outlets to Dongyang merchants and South China merchants in this city, so the market is stable. However, the overall situation is that because the inventory is abundant (approximately 200,000 bags), it is not easy for the market to rise.</p>
<h3>Local Indica Reviving in the Interior</h3>
<p>Foreign rice initially had continuous arrivals, and yesterday there were new arrivals. Saigon No. 3 and other rice still have goods on the way and new orders continuing to arrive, so market sentiment is inevitably shaken. However, domestic demand has not weakened, and yesterday's appetite was still strong. Merchants in Beiyang, the Yangtze River, and this city also responded slightly, so the market returned to stability. The city sold over 16,000 bags of spot foreign rice, 10,000 bags of goods on the way, and approximately 3,000 bags of local indica rice. Because domestic demand for local indica rice is reviving, the market is slightly firmer by 1-2 fen. Other aspects are generally stable.</p>
<p>Sticky rice (South Shanghai) had arrivals from various merchants yesterday, about 30th day (nearly 6,000 piculs), and sales, such as Cheng Xie in this city, had customers from Qinhuangdao merchants taking four or five loads, totaling over 500 bags. The overall trend seems to be balanced between sales and supply, and the market is stable. The prices of thick rice and thin rice did not change. Looking at the future market situation, it seems that it has been stable, with little change in the prices of glutinous rice. (North Shanghai) Yesterday's arrivals from various sources in Hexia were about 20th day. The market's sales of various goods turned weak. The selling price of high-quality white japonica rice was maintained with difficulty, while medium-quality rice was down several fen. Early thin rice was nominally stable but actually weak. High-quality white japonica rice was fixed, while medium-quality rice was down several fen. The rest of the varieties were generally average.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Strong Trading in Fine Eyebrow Green Tea</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign tea market in this port suddenly became lively. British merchants such as Jardine Matheson, Jardine Skinner, and Union Insurance, as well as the China Tea Company, saw strong demand for fine eyebrow green tea from Sui'an, Wenzhou, and local areas because new tea shipments were not surging and the ships were approaching. A total of over 1,300 chests were traded in the city, and trading was quite active. Among them, Sui'an goods from local estates opened at 90 yuan, a firm rise of 1-2 yuan compared to before, and the arrivals have been completely sold out. In addition, over 600 chests of Qimen black tea have arrived in Hangzhou and should arrive in Shanghai within days.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Talk of Implementing Tax Increase Resurfaces - Re-Exported Dutch Refined White Rises by 5 Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw renewed activity and a tighter market trend due to rumors that the 6/1 excise tax would be implemented. The guild set the price of No. 24 Dutch raw white sugar at 16.40 yuan, then rose to 16.42 yuan, and there was also a shortage of ex-warehouse goods, which rose by 2 fen. Re-export goods arriving on May 18th were 5.30 yuan, and spot goods were 5.35 yuan, a rise of 5 jiao. Approximately 1,000 bags were traded. Taikoo Sugar B-grade from this warehouse was quoted at 17.40 yuan, and Taikoo refined white sugar was also tighter. Zhenyu Hao quoted 15.90 yuan, Siming No. 1 quoted 15.80 yuan. Nos. 3 and 4 were sold according to rebates. Siming No. 1 rock sugar was 27.70 yuan, and No. 2 was 26.60 yuan. In the evening session, Chaozhou merchants offered over 260 bags of Hainan red sugar at a price of 10.05 yuan, with no change.</p>
<h3>Dried and Fresh Goods: Black Melon Seeds Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>After Guangdong merchants purchased a large quantity of black melon seeds, Fujian merchants also followed suit, so the trend was greatly boosted. Listed prices gradually firmed, such as top-grade Jikui seeds opening at 11.60 to 11.80 yuan, high-grade Xu Kui seeds opening at 9.90 yuan for 100 bags, ordinary seeds opening at 9.45 to 9.50 yuan for 200+ bags, and Mingguang seeds quoted at 8 yuan each. An inventory check showed there were still 25,000 bags in stock, a small amount, so merchants quoted Jikui seeds at 12 yuan, high-grade Xu Kui seeds at 10 yuan, and ordinary seeds at 9.50 to 9.20 yuan. Tightness should be anticipated. Because current sales are brisk, merchants are also raising prices in small increments, so the rise is relatively strong.</p>

<h3>"Civilization Lamp for Women"</h3>
<p>—Han Feng</p>
<p>Late Qing dynasty storytelling novel, recently obtained a book called Illustrated 20th Century Civilization Lamp for Women, by Zhong Qingxin Qing, revised by the owner of Pingquan Pavilion, published by Mingming Xue She in June of the Xuantong third year, a lithographed horizontal book, probably a reading material sold at roadside stalls. The book includes a preface by the owner of Pingquan Pavilion. The preface said of the storytelling:</p>
<p>"In today's society, people of all kinds are competing for storytelling novels. In Shanghai alone, there are no less than hundreds of places. And storytelling is especially trusted by women, often their shoes and socks intertwined, laughing and talking related. And the storyteller sitting in the corner sings the opening, then no one is translating. Once completed, mouth-speaking gestures, with relish to the book, but three smile marriage, falling gold fan and other adultery matters, and beautify its name talented scholars and beautiful women, so that listeners are dizzy, spread as good talk, turn to imitate, this is why society is decadent. Therefore, improving Liang Xu Jianyi Si, no less than compiling a female school textbook."</p>
<p>The wide influence of storytelling, the numerous book fields, the bad effect of selling storytelling, and the necessity of improvement are all evident here. The author in the book also discussed the old storytelling being unsuitable for the present day, and the benefits of this revised "Civilization Lamp for Women":</p>
<p>Female education has been in decline for a thousand years, textbooks should be in seven-character verses. Wonderful, teach loyalty, filial piety and chastity, but some are excessive, and he has not escaped a few chapters of his study. The remaining customs of Ren and Si have not died out, this tune can be counted as Lu Lingguang. Only worry about evil consequences repeatedly, talented scholars and beauties spread matters. Fruit report, depicting picking orchids and cheating with concubines; Shuangzhufeng, promoting stealing jade and stealing fragrance; Sun Shenghua, one husband and many wives ruin ethics; Rebirth fate, women dressing as men disrupt discipline. That's it, the seven characters build an equal boundary, a sound wakes up the silk incense. Adding hundreds of millions to complete personality, not counting three thousand powder Dai lines.</p>
<p>The author is very proud of this story, so the dialogue also includes: "Specially wrote the Civilization Lamp story for women, designed to improve the women's society. Relying on the Dharma drum and conch, making people wake up: or can salvage the overall situation, reverse the universe." "Civilization is piled up, the tune is sonorous, most suitable for boudoir daughter's intestines." However, although it can not be as the author said, has that kind of influence, but his spirit of opening up new territory is valuable. Because in storytelling novels, old works, with very few exceptions, are always unable to jump out of the "talented scholar and beautiful woman", "heroic sons and daughters" two types, and the author can have such a vision, is always difficult.</p>
<p>The book has eight acts: Education, Unbound Feet, Arts, Superstition, Child Brides, Breaking Prison, Tea Party, Rejection of Treaty. Using Ms. Beauty-Pi's spirit of tea to the East, visiting Confucius' mother in Qufu, transporting the civilization of Europe and the West to open the scene. The content of each scene can be seen in the synopsis. It should be added that "Breaking Prison" is about rescuing child brides from dark families, "Rejecting Treaty" is about the Chinese Exclusion Act in the United States, and the anti-foreign goods movement in China, and "Tea Party" is about free gatherings of men and women to open up the atmosphere. The first scene, the opening:</p>
<p>Explain the national responsibility, to fulfill the freedom of duty. Do not say it is the skirt</p>
<p>Hairpin, men and women out equal. Equal equality, idle reading Rousseau's political theory (Dan quoted, like a dream order)</p>
<p>This can explain a trend in the writing world at that time, that is, to try to use new nouns, new terms, to show the depth of their new learning. The novel "New Karma Mirror" once satirized this tendency very fiercely, saying that a new scholar recorded new nouns into a secret book, and after the manuscript was written, he took out the useful ones from the secret book and embedded them one by one, replacing the old terms in the original manuscript. This is certainly excessive, but the prevalence of the tendency is visible. Although "Civilization Lamp" also uses new nouns, most of it is very natural. The other exceptions, such as "Husband is talented, knows the words of Brahma; family is quiet, idle to turn Rousseau's book one", but not much. Among all the books, the lyrics in "Reject Treaty" are the most readable:</p>
<p>A wooden house is imprisoned with new entry, the dream soul is tragically broken in the old hometown. Thinking of who lost the power of the early development of the Americas, cutting thorns and removing thorns is our yellow species. To this day, the land is wide open and the sweat is forgotten, and we treat our compatriots like half sheep. Thinking about it, they are all guests from other continents, but other kinds are not as strong as white. As long as Japan can be self-reliant recently, it will meet everywhere and be widely praised. This time, the harsh treaty is revised, do not say that our people are easy to show strength. Fortunately, the gentry and merchants are seeking to boycott, not selling American goods and rejecting the ocean.</p>
<p>Regarding literary works about the "Chinese Exclusion Act", I have seen a chapter in Liang Qichao's "Travel Notes of the New World" (New People's Cong Bao temporary supplement), novels such as "New Story of Rejecting Treaty", "Bitter Society", etc., and this is the first kind in storytelling. The effectiveness of such writing, without doubt, is greater than that of works that are pedantic. The content of "Civilization Lamp", is indeed as the author said, is a textbook, introducing new knowledge of female innovation.</p>
<p>The eight acts I have seen are the upper volume, and it is not possible to verify whether the lower volume has been published, because most of the books were published in installments at that time, and very few were printed at the same time. But even this can glimpse the whole. This book is now more rare than "Gengzi National Change Storytelling", "National Change Storytelling" is made by the hands of learned people, and is thread-bound, and there are still people collecting it. I am afraid that there are no collectors of this kind of door-panel book. There is an illustration in each act, some of which are good.</p>
<p>Appendix: The previous work "Another Boxer Storytelling" one meaning, after getting "National Change Storytelling", began to know that the former is the first twenty chapters of reading, is a falsely printed edition, in fact, not two books, I hope readers pay attention.</p>
<h3>The Weariness of Life</h3>
<p>—Already</p>
<p>Bearing the burden of life, I have walked nearly ten years of my life journey with great hardship, and now I feel exhausted and unable to continue to catch up with this unfinished journey!</p>
<p>Is the path of the world flat or rugged? Perhaps it is flat? I see some people walking easily and comfortably, without any sign of pain. Even myself, in the decades before ten years ago, when I was being led by others and the burden of life was not yet pressed down on my shoulders, wasn't I also walking a flat path in the world? However, it is clearly rugged. The past ten years, I, and the group who share the same fate with me, have tasted the infinite bitterness of this rugged path of the world. It goes without saying that we have been subjected to the attacks of wind, frost, rain, and dew. At what moment have our feet not been pricked and bleeding by the thorns on the road!</p>
<p>I think it was because I was young and strong at that time, or because the burden of life was lighter. In the first few years of setting out on the journey, my spirit was excited, my mood was happy, my spirit was brave, my will was strong, and my hope was bright. On the road, no matter how much pain I suffered or how many obstacles I encountered, they could not make my advancing footsteps shrink back in fear of difficulty. But how is it now?</p>
<p>Now, on this journey of life, I feel extremely tired! I also know that the journey of life only has a path to go, and there is no way back. We should strive to move forward, that is the solution. To retreat is to perish. But to move forward, I am really too tired! I no longer have the strength to carry the burden that is getting heavier on my shoulders. I have suffered enough of the grinding of body and mind. Even if I want to struggle again, it is a bit difficult. I admit that I am cowardly! I have to temporarily stop my feet and take a breath beside this halfway. But is it possible for me to do this?</p>
<p>I stretch my neck and look forward. The distance of the journey is unknown. It is separated by mountains and rivers, clouds and fog, overlapping and vast. But oh, even if this is a journey that cannot be reached, is overlapping, and is vast, I cannot but reluctantly rally my dissipated energy and take on this burden of life. Panting, dripping with sweat, walking forward step by step with great difficulty, to the end of this journey of life, when I am still alive. I really don't dare to look back at the hideous and terrifying face of the demon of life that is whipping me from behind!</p>
<h3>Decisive Battle</h3>
<p>— Fan Hai</p>
<p>My hatred for you,</p>
<p>Hatred beyond the hatred of killing my father!</p>
<p>In the sky,</p>
<p>There are no two suns;</p>
<p>On the ground,</p>
<p>There are no two emperors,</p>
<p>Please come to that square,</p>
<p>I must have a decisive battle with you,</p>
<p>You smear humanity,</p>
<p>You unbridled bastard!</p>
<p>Please don't put on that cowardly, pitiful look,</p>
<p>Now,</p>
<p>I have to settle accounts with you!</p>
<p>Let you think about the past show of force</p>
<p>Okay!</p>
<p>After all these years,</p>
<p>I was panting and crawling on the ground,</p>
<p>Now,</p>
<p>I want to raise my iron hair,</p>
<p>I want to break through the crust,</p>
<p>Come and fight with you for the sun shining on the ground!</p>
<p>Coward, go away!</p>
<p>To that square!</p>
<p>With the blue sky as a witness,</p>
<p>I will have a decisive battle with you!</p>
<p>2, 8, 1935!</p>
<h3>Mourning (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Pillow Stone</p>
<p>I should replace all the words of mourning with crying. However, when I learned of your death, I did not cry either. I just remained silent, silent. In this silence, great hidden pain played out in my heart. I myself also find it strange that after years of cruel torment, I have completely lost the ability to cry. For me, there is only hatred. You know, hatred gnaws at my heart, and the pain is even more unbearable than crying!</p>
<p>At this time last year, our mother was entangled by illness and died. At that time, I could hardly cry out tears or sounds, only the past events of my mother suffering for her children repeatedly, endlessly涌上心頭, like a sharp drill, piercing my heart, piercing every piece of flesh on my body. In the moment when my mother died, when she纹痛得大聲嘶喊到沒有了聲音也沒有了氣息的时分, our old father was crying, our siblings were crying, my wife was crying, even my young son was crying in his dream. But oh! Second brother, you do not know the tragic state of our mother's death at that time, although she did not forget you, who had no news for years, on the day before her death, but now, I know that you have died a year before our mother.</p>
<p>When the setting sun is on the barren grass, and crows are flying and crowing in the tile rubble field, where the tombs are scattered, where can I find your bones? Moreover, the invisible fences block my return journey. How can I go to your grave to worship? Oh! Infinite hatred in the world, where to cry for the lonely soul? Second brother! I should only look up to the sky and let the tears flow far to my heart! Forever, forever, it is desolate and hateful,</p>
<p>The torment of the past few years has made me an incomplete person who has lost his emotions, but deep impressions can still evoke my memories. I remember it was an evening on the Mid-Autumn Festival. I began to flee, and began to drift to the ends of the earth to be a wandering person.</p>
<h3>Stealing Taro</h3>
<p>— Li Sanlang</p>
<p>The black night, the southern countryside is vastly unfolded like a large and dark curtain, and the sparse villages are quietly submerged in the night, the trees rustle like huge demons, the terrible sounds of mourning and the women's tearful sobs. The uneven hills can still be vaguely captured by people's eyes, and the rice stalks in the paddy fields sway gently with the weeds by the roadside.</p>
<p>People are like in a dream, and only the busy dogs can be heard barking in the distance.</p>
<p>There is no moon, the sky is full of sorrow. A few small stars that are still struggling emit a kind of crying light.</p>
<p>A-Qian's wife quietly carries a dustpan and a hoe, and runs lightly on the familiar mountain path overgrown with weeds. On tiptoe, for fear of being seen by others. Although in that dark and calm mountain field, she does not worry about being devoured by ghosts or beasts, she is most afraid of meeting someone in the green forest. ——Alas, stealing taro, a thief of stealing taro. If she gets caught, she will not only be fined ten yuan but also be humiliated! However, it is not afraid of being humiliated. There are enough people stealing things these days. Like that rich second aunt, she even hired many people to cultivate the land. Stealing from other people's homes is unconscionable, bah! Who says it is not right to steal from her home? However, in case, where to get ten yuan? There is basically nothing to eat, and her husband is sick, so she does this.</p>
<p>Thinking, running, her heart jumping uneasily. ——A load also gets three or five yuan...</p>
<p>The field is dead, there is no turbulent sound, only the wind, only the wind that sweeps the hearts of the people, like sharp arrows, piercing her tense heart one by one. Her tired and hungry eyes, which were sunk, emitted light in the dark night.</p>
<p>On one high taro field after another, she was busy turning over the loose soil with her hands and feet. Following that, one by one, like field rats, hairy taro rolled out, round, long, small, in pairs, swaying her heart like gold; yes, she had never smiled so excitedly, in the dark night, she could vaguely reveal the smile marks on her long face.</p>
<p>There was no sound on the earth, she was afraid that her hoe would disturb the male watchman who was watching over another mountain forest. ——Immediately, several blurred, terrible blood-like faces released a sneer, and several guns aimed at her as if drawing, thick ropes, and the second aunt's fat mouth, always endlessly,啧啧 ground cursing, rotten smelly goods, old 　　(Note: that is, prostitute), that strange ugly look, snake-like sounds constantly pouring out of her head. Wasn't A-Si's wife dragged into the group security bureau like that half a month ago? ——Hey! How terrible it is.</p>
<p>She calmed her mind and quickly loaded it into the dustpan. She could not feel the weight of the thirty or forty pounds of fresh taro on her shoulders, but she felt as if some hateful guy was dragging behind the burden. The more she was afraid of being caught up, the more desperately her two legs had to run, panting, and the person seemed to be swaying like a torrent. Only when she carried the load to her own toilet pit, did she feel at ease, and she hurriedly buried the taro in a large pile of ash that she picked out from her home every day, dropped the load, and pretended to be normal and walked away as if she had returned from urinating in the toilet pit.</p>
<p>The next morning, the village spread the news that someone had stolen the second aunt's taro. The fat woman cursed as if she had lost gold:</p>
<p>"The one who stole my taro will be struck by lightning, either dead or a rotten smelly thing, you! Eating my taro will definitely be unlucky..."</p>
<p>Never mind her, A-Qian's wife smiled secretly, and also planned how to pick it to the market to sell it.</p>
<h3>Three Days (5)</h3>
<p>— Luo Hong</p>
<p>Huang Zhongpu revealed his upper row of yellowed teeth again, and the six or seven wrinkles on his forehead were squeezed tightly together, his face looking pitiful as if he were afraid of being beaten. It was as if, whether Youfa or Youcai had any ideas, Master Lu would respond to them respectfully with a single word. He understood Master Lu's temper best; if others argued with him, he would never let it go easily. If Youfa and the others didn't agree to this condition, Master Lu would get angry and not only refuse to lend money, but might also resort to other means, such as...</p>
<p>Huang Zhongpu was truly like a roundworm in Master Lu's stomach. Sure enough, Master Lu stood up, flicked away the two-fen-long cigarette butt, and said to him in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Is today the seventeenth?"</p>
<p>"Yesterday was the twenty-sixth - that's right, today is the twenty-seventh."</p>
<p>"In that case, the two hundred yuan they borrowed from the Longhui will be due in only three days. Hmph, who dares to delay payment to the Longhui by even half a day? They'll have to find a way. I say, Zhongpu—"</p>
<p>Master Lu took another step closer to Huang Zhongpu, looking strangely intimate. "Go tell the local constable to press Youfa's family a little harder. Let's see how tough they can be!"</p>
<p>Huang Zhongpu agreed repeatedly. He had a greasy feeling in his heart. Whenever Master Lu showed him some intimacy, he felt a strange greasiness in his heart, as if he were being stroked by a woman's hand. He had been Master Lu's confidant, relying on Master Lu to supplement him with fifty or sixty yuan each year, for over twenty years now, but he had only had that greasy feeling three times. Once was during the locust plague, when the Longhui was being formed. Magistrate Wang and the others wanted to store the grain in the township office, as a place to accumulate grain. Master Lu was terribly anxious and wanted Huang Zhongpu to come up with an idea. He came up with the suggestion to have the local constables tell Magistrate Wang and the others that storing the grain in the township office was unreliable because the township office was noisy, and if something went wrong, no one would take responsibility. Master Lu's family had spacious granaries, and dividing out two rooms would be enough, and Master Lu had always been enthusiastic about public welfare, and he would certainly not begrudge those two rooms and refuse to lend them out. After saying this several times, the matter was successfully resolved. At that time, Master Lu had praised him for being capable and praised him very intimately. The second time was last year when Master Lu celebrated his fiftieth birthday but didn't have a son. He had married three concubines, but they had only given birth to daughters. Master Lu valued the "lack of descendants being the greatest act of unfilial piety," so he was very worried about this matter. Huang Zhongpu understood his concerns and acted as a matchmaker. He had often heard Master Lu say that Zhou Si's daughter was very beautiful, and if she were dressed better, she would be more beautiful than his three concubines. So he repeatedly discussed it with Zhou Si, and the engagement that had been promised for one hundred yuan was canceled. Zhou Si's daughter, with her melon-seed face, became Master Lu's fourth concubine. It could also be said that this young girl was fortunate enough to give birth to a son. So, on the day of the full moon celebration, Master Lu had intimately toasted him a cup of wine. Now, this time was considered the third time.</p>
<p>"Only three days left. Don't worry, Master, they can't escape. Without you, Master, they wouldn't be able to borrow money. It's no use if that kid Youcai is stubborn. The Longhui's money must be repaid when it's due. I'm not afraid of him stopping his wife from being a wet nurse!" He also imitated Master Lu's way of speaking, as if reciting an article, drawing out each word.</p>
<p>"Mmm... mmm," Master Lu hummed in his throat, with his hands tucked into his sleeves, pacing back and forth with his head lowered. Seeing this, Huang Zhongpu knew that he didn't need to say anything more to him; Master Lu had already thought of something. So Huang Zhongpu bid farewell and walked out.</p>

<p>Brief Comments</p>
<h3>Taiyuan Prostitutes Implement Perming Hair and Wearing High Heels</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Shanxi Province is a place with a very pure social atmosphere. However, now I hear that prostitutes in Taiyuan are all going to perm their hair and wear high heels, which is a bit unusual.</p>
<p>Prostitutes perming their hair and wearing high heels is not uncommon in itself. What's strange is that the implementation of perming hair and wearing high heels by prostitutes in Taiyuan is not the prostitutes' own desire, but rather they are being forced to do so.</p>
<p>But don't mistakenly think that the social atmosphere in Shanxi Province is about to change. It should be known that the current perming of hair and wearing high heels by prostitutes in Taiyuan is not intentionally trying to become extravagant, but rather to make the originally pure social atmosphere even purer.</p>
<p>Originally, the intention behind requiring all prostitutes in Taiyuan to perm their hair and wear high heels was to "distinguish them from respectable women."</p>
<p>Perming hair and wearing high heels is a modern style of dress. I have never been to Shanxi Province or Taiyuan. I'm not sure if there are modern women in Taiyuan, and whether the modern women there also perm their hair and wear high heels. But judging from the phrase "distinguish them from respectable women," even the modern women in Taiyuan, presumably, do not perm their hair and wear high heels. Therefore, some people, in order to make the pure social atmosphere in Shanxi Province even purer, have ordered prostitutes to perm their hair and wear high heels to avoid the risk of confusing the genuine with the fake.</p>
<p>Naturally, prostitutes are not respectable women, but rather non-respectable women. Since prostitutes are non-respectable women, their attire naturally cannot be the same as that of respectable women. In that case, the implementation of all prostitutes in Taiyuan perming their hair and wearing high heels is very meaningful. Moreover, in addition to perming hair and wearing high heels, they must also wear a "peach blossom badge." This also symbolizes that they are a kind of wild grass and idle flowers.</p>
<p>However, some people say that asking prostitutes to perm their hair and wear high heels only benefits the prostitutes and does no harm. Because what prostitutes sell is their bodies, their attire must be fashionable in order to attract customers. Now that all the prostitutes in Taiyuan are perming their hair and wearing high heels, this will undoubtedly have some effect in attracting a bunch of lecherous men.</p>
<p>However, my view is different from this. Now, women in Taiyuan are probably gradually becoming fashionable, and there are also those who perm their hair and wear high-heeled leather shoes. Therefore, the authorities have ordered prostitutes to perm their hair and wear high-heeled leather shoes, so that respectable women dare not perm their hair or wear high-heeled leather shoes again. If a respectable woman wears high-heeled leather shoes and perms her hair again, she will be considered a prostitute. This is an excellent method of prohibiting extravagance. However, truly fashionable respectable women are not afraid of being suspected of being prostitutes and will not stop wearing high-heeled leather shoes and perming their hair.</p>
<h3>Night Berth</h3>
<p>— Ye Fei</p>
<p>The boat had just passed the Yellow Crane Gate when it started to rain; and according to the boatman, there would probably be a big storm tonight, wouldn't we suffer another misfortune! Everyone's heart felt like it was weighed down by dozens of pounds of lead, and it kept sinking, sinking; looking at the sky, it was gradually darkening. If we continued to move forward in this storm, not only would we still not reach our destination today, but there might be many dangers ahead: even as it is, letting it carry more than twenty people and floating on this white-crested tide is really worrying.</p>
<p>A not-very-large boat was floating on a huge lake, like a leaf carrying dozens of ants floating in the river; with just one jolt, there was a risk of capsizing. Under these circumstances, everyone's face seemed to be covered with a layer of fear. But even if we were anxious, it was useless. Besides trying our best to calm our restless hearts and comforting ourselves, we could only entrust our entire lives to this civilian boat.</p>
<p>Now everyone's only hope was that the sky would clear up immediately. If it didn't rain and there was no wind, then even sailing at night would be fine.</p>
<p>"Boatman, what should we do? We're adrift in the middle of the lake in this wind and</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>rain, and we're cold and hungry. Let's find a small port to dock in!" Everyone unanimously urged the boatman.</p>
<p>"This is the weather; what can I do? Don't worry, let's get into Xiangshan Port first," the boatman said, leaning one hand on the tiller and puffing on his pipe, comforting everyone gently.</p>
<p>"How far is it from here to Xiangshan Port?" This was a woman's voice.</p>
<p>"It's close!" he said, pointing with a dry pipe toward the bow of the boat. Sure enough, a pile of dark shadows was gradually moving toward the bow. "That mountain shadow is Xiangshan Port."</p>
<p>More than twenty people were huddled under the oilcloth awning. The boat was bumping through the waves like a running horse, and the raindrops hit the awning, making a clattering sound. Several of the passengers were smoking desperately to relieve this depression, and the smoke filled the awning, causing many people to cough incessantly. Three ladies, however, were vomiting over the side of the boat because they couldn't stand the rocking.</p>
<p>The boat slowly sailed in the rain, and the surrounding area was entirely ruled by the god of darkness; however, at this time, we couldn't find a second boat on the surrounding lake besides ours. The sound of the rain on the awning and the sound of the waves under the boat were harmoniously accompanying us, but everyone's mood in the boat was immersed in depression and restlessness. They were only staring blankly at the dim mast light. The light reflected on everyone's faces, and everyone was equally pale and listless. In every pair of eyes, however, was a light of annoyance.</p>
<p>At dusk, the boat finally entered Xiangshan Port and tied up under a large poplar tree, preparing to hide there for the night.</p>
<p>Everyone felt much relieved, but the stomachs that hadn't been filled all day couldn't help but rebel. I finally couldn't help but negotiate with the boatman, asking them to find something to fill our stomachs.</p>
<p>"Boatman, we haven't eaten anything all day, and we're really hungry now. Is there any way to solve this?" I asked the boatman.</p>
<p>"Today we have to ask the boat boss to prepare dinner for us; it's not okay to spend the night on an empty stomach. Anyway, everyone will pay for the food," the crowd echoed. But because there wasn't enough rice and there were too many people, they only cooked two pots of porridge. Everyone was extremely hungry, so even without vegetables, they could drink the plain porridge. The two pots of porridge were quickly snatched clean in no time, and several people still seemed not to have had enough.</p>
<p>Although our empty stomachs were finally filled, sleeping was another problem. How could the deck, which was less than ten feet long and no more than five feet wide, accommodate more than twenty people? And everyone had not brought bedding; although it was already late spring and early summer, it was still so chilly at night. So, except for a few who were snoring and sleeping soundly, most people sat slumped and hadn't closed their eyes once.</p>
<h3>The Temptation of the Bridal Sedan Chair</h3>
<p>— Yi An</p>
<h3>Life is Like a Lonely Lamp</h3>
<p>— Cheng Quan</p>
<p>Life is like a lonely lamp. It is just many of them strung together, or perhaps in twos and threes, floating in the boundless torrent of time, flickering, flashing, gathering and scattering. The light is faint, hazy—and sometimes, perhaps, there are one or two that glaringly emit a strong light, but in the torrent of time, in the entire universe, carefully looking, they are merely like shooting stars flashing by; following this stubborn, tragic flash is the inevitable shattering and annihilation, and what remains in this torrent of time is merely a pile of useless ashes. If one day a strong wind arises in the universe, and there are one or two or even extremely weak waves in the stream of time, then who has the courage to guarantee that those annihilated ashes will not be submerged to the bottom of the great river—to an infinitely deep bottom?</p>
<p>But these submerged, annihilated ashes, just a tenth of a second before, had illuminated one or two specks of dust, or even a tiny space of a thousandth of a square inch, with the faint light of life! Like a ghost in the wilderness.</p>
<p>(Can you really admit that this tragedy is supremely fair?)</p>
<p>But let us, like a botanist observing a small cotyledon, carefully look: Life, even if it is as weak as a lonely lamp in the torrent of the world, still has a moving and strong charm for the creatures that multiply on its surface! Its light is dim, but only it can be said to truly understand how to make people live patiently! It uses a faint light that can barely illuminate a grain of rice, and it always places this ghost-like light an inch in front of people, constantly boasting and enticing; thus, it makes people confusedly follow it, until they exhaust hundreds of thousands of a second of time and the faint light of life dies out at the same time, and they are submerged at the same time...!</p>
<p>To say that life is just a supremely weak lonely lamp, but for all of mankind, it is a supremely profound mystery. People look at it just as an astronomer uses unreliable instruments to observe distant planets; when he is amazed by many fine lines and mixed colors, he is also bewildered by an unsolvable mystery. Who has ever remembered that the dim gold at the bottom of the starlight is the laughter of a long-gone childhood; and who else dares to turn over the old shadows of green youth and purple love? Thus, what exists in this faint lonely light, the freshest and most indelible, is only the dark red trap of suffering and the dark shadow of old age.</p>
<p>As if endlessly, people are jumping, working, building, enduring, and displaying in different directions under the lonely lamp of life. The scenes on the road of life pass by in clusters. People pass through mountains and rivers, rolling in mud pits and climbing over thorns, but who has ever given up the power of life, who has ever forgotten the instinct to survive, and finally, who has ever carefully scrutinized a fleeting meteor in midsummer night?</p>
<p>Life is like a weak lonely lamp, but let us learn to praise this lonely lamp, even if it is weak, but has a strong charm; only it can make people live with more fervent goodwill; only it can place its weak light an inch in front of us, enticing and boasting. We are walking step by step, even if what awaits us in the end is a grave, ashes; even if life is a flickering fire in a thousandth of a second; let everything be! Life is a lonely lamp in the torrent of time!</p>

<h3>Great Shanghai Will Soon Screen "Arctic Exploration Disaster Record"</h3>
<p>"Arctic Exploration Disaster Record" is a historical treasure that records the Soviet Arctic exploration of 1934. When the exploration team set off from Russia, newspapers from various countries reported it, recognizing it as a major event in modern exploration history. The entire exploration team of one hundred and four members set off on the icebreaker "Chelyuskin", experiencing all kinds of difficulties and obstacles. Unfortunately, the "Chelyuskin" was crushed by floating ice midway, and the exploration team members escaped to the ice, drifting for two months. Finally, they were rescued by the Soviet Air Force at risk and were able to return alive.</p>
<p>This film was actually taken by the famous photographer Shavlovran, who accompanied the exploration team. Therefore, the entire film is a true-life scene and is a rare find among exploration films. The screening of the film has been decided to begin on the 8th at the Great Shanghai Grand Theater in this city. It is heard that along with the film, there will also be newsreels of Mei Lanfang's recent performance in Russia and the Soviet International Film Exhibition.</p>
<h3>Xu Lai and Hu Jia Have Both Fallen</h3>
<p>Director Shen Xiling's "Boatman's Daughter" depicts rural bankruptcy and social economic panic, causing those kind souls to eventually become bad people under the pressure of a poor environment. Xu Lai and Hu Jia, these two true country girls, were abducted to the city and sold to a brothel, forcing them to become prostitutes. When those drunken customers raised their glasses full of wine and smiled vaguely, "Girl! Drink a glass for Grandpa's sake!" Although they were already drunk, they had to smile bitterly, take the glass, and drink wildly.</p>
<p>When filming this scene, Shen Xiling, with a mournful face, asked others for advice everywhere, saying that his own experience was insufficient.</p>
<h3>Guan Gong and the Nurse in "The God of Freedom"</h3>
<p>Inside a clean living room, pale red light softly painted the white gauze curtains. Looking through the gaps in the gauze curtains, one could see a writing room! It also served as a clinic. Several human physiological anatomical charts hung on the wall. Dr. Yang and Zhou Bo, both beaming, were earnestly acting under the camera. His face, coated with a shellac-like oil paint in the makeup room, resembled Guan Gong in Peking opera, but on the screen, it displayed a weathered and experienced look.</p>
<p>In another corner of the clinic, stood Miss Wu Mei, a nurse, her eyes filled with emotion as she gazed intently at Dr. Yang. Wu Mei, also a stalwart member of the drama circle, received exceptional attention in the talent-filled Dian Tong Company. The night before, many audience members were amazed by her acting skills. Dian Tong, known for its five virgins, has added another.</p>
<h3>Li Lili Performs Peking Opera</h3>
<p>Li Lili is a master of song and dance, a film star known to all, but few probably know that she can perform Peking Opera. When Lianhua was filming the interior scene of the "Autumn Fan and Bright Lantern" court, she played the role of a lawyer. Wearing the wide-sleeved lawyer's uniform, she swayed back and forth with the bearing of a Peking Opera performer. Encouraged by everyone, she performed a section of "Xigu Ma Cao," captivating the audience with her voice and demeanor. Even the solemn judge listened with unrestrained delight, almost falling off the bench.</p>

<h3>New Trends in American Heavy and Light Cars</h3>
<p>— Zhenmin</p>
<p>In recent years, the biggest change in the American automobile market has been the rise of light cars and the decline of heavy cars. Previously, the sales of heavy cars accounted for almost 80% of the total number of cars. The main reason for this popularity was probably that engineers designed heavy cars with particular precision. The bodies of heavy cars were extremely sturdy and streamlined, and their interiors were very luxurious. In contrast, light cars at that time were truly inferior.</p>
<p>Indeed, the design of heavy cars, due to their large mass, made the problem of center of gravity distribution relatively easy to solve. With a little attention during planning, an appropriate weight and volume ratio could be achieved, making the car very stable during driving, without any impact whatsoever.</p>
<p>However, the situation was different for light cars. The distribution of the center of gravity was most difficult. Often, a light car would be well-designed, but when actually driven, it would be prone to overturning under strong acceleration. In the past, in American long-distance racing, many drivers lost their lives due to light car rollovers. These past failures of light cars are truly worthy of study.</p>
<p>After various failures, engineers have gradually discovered the crux of the matter. New light cars now have their center of gravity lowered as much as possible, and the body is also lowered, with the pedals close to the ground. This is the greatest success in the practical design of light cars in recent years.</p>
<p>In recent years, the problem of space has become increasingly serious in cities around the world due to population growth. Large heavy cars, driving on busy roads, not only take up a lot of space, but are also difficult to maneuver. This is the main reason for the rise of light cars in recent years.</p>
<p>In general, car owners are very satisfied with the economic benefits of using light cars. First, light cars are flexible in operation. Second, daily inspections are simple and convenient. Third, in the event of a breakdown, light cars can be quickly repaired and restored to their original condition. All of this has left a deep impression on car owners.</p>
<p>Last year, Ford's 8 to 10 horsepower light car sales reached 68%. The completeness of this light car's construction is truly admirable. The roof is now made of all steel, and it is extremely streamlined, which was rare in the past for light cars. Furthermore, there are five steps for changing speeds, rapid braking, and agile acceleration gear action, especially.</p>
<p>Morris's best-selling light car last year was also astounding. Heavy cars only accounted for 30% of sales. The sale of the Hillman Minx has been popular for a while. According to users, the average gasoline and repair costs per mile when using a light car are 25% less than when using a heavy car. In ordinary engineering practice, the larger the engine, the less power is lost. Now, the small engine of a light car is economical. This is indeed the strangest question.</p>
<p>Currently, most of the cars on the streets of American cities are between 10 and 15 horsepower. The next most common are 15 to 20 horsepower. The fewest are vehicles with 25 horsepower or more. Cars traveling on highways are almost entirely light cars with 10 to 20 horsepower. This new trend has never been seen before.</p>
<p>In the past, another reason why car owners did not trust light cars was their low speed. Because light cars have small engines, limited cylinder volume, and a small compression ratio, the engine's power is reduced, and a high speed cannot be achieved. But this is no longer a problem. Although the engine is small, the compression ratio has been greatly increased, and with the addition of well-matched gears, the speed has increased significantly. Now, let's list the increase in light car speeds in recent years as follows:</p>
<p>Year Horsepower Top Speed (Miles per Hour)</p>
<p>1929 10 hp 50</p>
<p>1930 10 hp 80</p>
<p>1931 10 hp 90</p>
<p>1932 10 hp 95</p>
<p>1933 10 hp 105</p>
<p>1934 10 hp 150</p>
<p>1935 10 hp 200</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be seen that the speed of light cars has been increasing in recent years. Because of the high speed, the structure of the cylinders has also been greatly improved. The metal of the cylinders is now made of a special alloy, which is hard and resistant to acid. The excellence of the radiator is unmatched by ordinary heavy cars.</p>
<p>The craze for light car manufacturing among American car factories this year is almost unquestionable. Given the current situation, although heavy cars have not been completely abandoned by light cars, the future automobile market will undoubtedly belong entirely to light cars.</p>
<h3>The New Oldsmobile</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>—Knee-Action Wheels and Other Features—</p>
<p>The Knee-Action wheel is the greatest contribution to driving comfort in the history of automobiles. This is proven by the experience of millions of car owners over the years. Oldsmobile engineers, having verified the effectiveness of Knee-Action through millions of Oldsmobile cars in 1934, decided to continue to apply it to every Oldsmobile produced in 1935, making it a standard feature without increasing the price.</p>
<p>When considering why Oldsmobile has become more comfortable with the application of Knee-Action, it is because its front wheels can move up and down independently without being constrained by each other. The bumps and vibrations that used to be transmitted through the front axle to all other parts of the car are now eliminated by Knee-Action. When driving over ruts or encountering bumps, the coil springs of the front wheels can absorb the vibrations without transmitting them to the car or the passengers. Furthermore, the alignment of the wheels is also more precise, which extends the life of the tires.</p>
<p>What is particularly noteworthy is that Knee-Action also greatly enhances safety. The use of these front wheels makes central management steering possible, making handling natural and easy in critical situations. For added safety, the 1935 Oldsmobile also features improved self-energizing hydraulic brakes with increased braking area of 14%. The action is sensitive, precise, and extremely easy to operate.</p>
<p>Another advantage of the Oldsmobile six-cylinder and eight-cylinder models is sound insulation. The car's chassis and engine are completely soundproofed using scientifically sound principles. The Fisher all-steel solid top and door panels are made of excellent insulation material to prevent noise from entering. In addition, features such as a completely silent helical gear transmission, three-point rubber-mounted engine brackets, and specially designed mufflers are all found in the Oldsmobile. This is why it is the only quiet and beautiful car.</p>
<h3>Another Batch of New LaFayette Cars on Display</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>Another batch of new LaFayette cars produced by Nash Motors has arrived in Shanghai. The local dealer, Hejin Company, will display them in the showroom at the end of this week for public viewing. These new cars are priced in the lowest category, but their seven-bearing crankshaft, 18-horsepower engine, and 39 other fine features are unique to LaFayette. Other low-priced vehicles certainly do not have them all. Mr. Greenblatt, the sales manager of Hejin, told people that these new cars truly offer all the advantages of a Nash engine to new car owners. At such a low price, it would have been difficult to manufacture such a perfect car in the past. Today, due to advancements in the factory's production methods, favorable raw material market transactions, and various other factors, this unprecedented masterpiece can be achieved. The new car's engine uses a five-point rubber mount, so its operation is silent and does not cause vibrations. Full pressure lubrication, with pressurized oil supplied to the piston pins and cylinder walls, are all features of large cars, which are now found in cars at such a low price. The new car is 189.5 inches long overall, extremely spacious and comfortable. The four-door sedan has an interior length of 86 inches from the partition to the rear window. Another feature of the new car is its new ventilation system. Regardless of the weather, one can enjoy extremely quiet ventilation without obstructing the passenger's view or being exposed to gusts of wind. With so many advantages at such a low price, these new cars will undoubtedly be warmly welcomed by the general public once they are released. This can be stated with certainty.</p>
<h3>A Collection of Automobile News</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>The Relationship Between Cars and Women: Lord Nuffield of England recently gave a speech at Oxford, praising women's driving. He did not admit that they were a threat. They are really no different from male drivers. Nuffield said, "If you think that there are many neurotic women drivers, I can agree. But if you say that they are all bad, then I completely disagree." Lord Nuffield continued, people who use cars should express their gratitude to women in many ways, because they have greatly helped the current development of cars. This has always been overlooked. All car colors, interior decoration, parts, ease of driving, and body styles, it can be said that none of them are not influenced by them. Regarding the activity of the British Morris Motor factory, Nuffield also mentioned that the time when Morris production reaches one car per minute is not far away.</p>
<p>Increased German Automobile Production: In 1934, Germany manufactured a total of 130,000 cars. This number increased by 58% compared to 1933. However, it has not reached the amount hoped for by the government. Since the abolition of horsepower tax, German automobile production in 1933 has doubled. However, last year's autumn seasonal demand declined, which was unprecedented. Although production did not increase sufficiently, public demand continued to advance. This can be seen from two points: First, the domestic production in 1934 increased by 58% compared to the previous year; Second, the sales of foreign cars in Germany increased to 73%. As for the reason for the decline in German automobile production, the biggest reason is the lack of raw materials.</p>
<p>Continued Increase in American Car Production: In February 1934, the average weekly automobile production in the United States reached 65,000 vehicles. This year's February output has exceeded 80,000 vehicles per week. Therefore, it is estimated that the production of American cars and trucks in the first three months of this year will exceed 1,000,000 vehicles. A year ago, the automobile production in the first three months was 750,000 vehicles. Since 1930, the automobile production in the first quarter of each year has been increasing slowly but constantly. The increase in automobile production in the first quarter of 1934 is even more evident when compared with the same period in 1933. Because in the first quarter of 1933, the total production of all brands of cars was only 368,265 vehicles. Regarding the future prospects of the automobile industry, we can measure it by the resumption of activity of three companies out of the five major companies—Studebaker, Pierce-Arrow, and Willys-Overland. These three major factories were once stagnant due to the impact of the recession. Among them, the reorganization plan of Studebaker has been approved by the court. The other two are also in the process of deliberation. The increase in future production can be predicted.</p>
<h3>On the Heat Supply of the Carburetor System (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Lu</p>
<p>For modern, high-quality cars, the standard method for ensuring complete gasoline vaporization is to heat the mixture of gasoline and air before it enters the cylinder by bringing it into contact with a surface heated by the exhaust. If the air entering the carburetor itself is slowly passed around a surface heated by the exhaust to warm it, then the gasoline will naturally vaporize more easily. In this case, in practice, the heated surface is on the outside of the exhaust pipe. In addition, there is another method, which is to install an air jacket on the carburetor float bowl cover and allow a portion of the hot exhaust gas from the cylinder to pass through this air jacket to heat the gasoline inside the float bowl. The above-mentioned methods of using exhaust to heat are a great improvement over using a water jacket and cooling system water to heat, because with this type of method, the heat supplied is very high. However, to achieve the best results for gasoline vaporization, the following methods must be used to make up for deficiencies: Use an exhaust jacketed intake manifold, or a heated intake manifold, or a combined exhaust and intake manifold. In short, if you want to use ordinary commercial gasoline more economically, today's carburetors must be equipped with heating equipment (this equipment specifically refers to heating manifolds).</p>
<p>Many old cars, when manufactured, had satisfactory carburetor system operation because the gasoline quality was good at that time. However, now, the gasoline economy and engine operation—especially before the engine is fully warmed up—have made the drivers or owners of these cars feel very dissatisfied. In many of these old cars, the carburetor system can be modernized, and it does not cost much. If a ready-made combined exhaust and intake manifold can be purchased on the market, it can simply be replaced. Alternatively, the original intake manifold can be fitted with an exhaust jacket, which yields the same effect. Another method is to preheat the air entering the carburetor through appropriate devices. However, there is no general rule for how to modernize the carburetor system of old cars. It must be determined according to the specific circumstances of each car. In general, there are few places to modernize the carburetor system in engines where the intake manifold is not mounted on the outside. The only thing that can be done is to install a device to heat the air entering the carburetor, or to replace it with a ready-made carburetor with a water jacket or an exhaust jacket.</p>
<p>We know that heating air or a mixture causes it to expand and become lighter. We also know that this heated air or mixture, compared to cold air or a mixture, is drawn into the cylinder in a much lighter weight under the same engine or throttle opening. In theory, this will weaken the pressure exerted on the piston during the explosion. However, in reality, the explosion pressure generated by the heated mixture is very slightly different from the explosion pressure generated by the unheated mixture, and it has almost no significant practical significance? Unless designing an engine for a special task, such as a racing car, consider this. Not only that, using an unheated mixture is not only fuel</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>uneconomical, but also the engine's operation—perhaps with the exception of hot summer weather—is very uneven.</p>
<p>In the past, almost all American-made cars were equipped with a carburetor stove to heat the air entering the carburetor. This device became unnecessary only after improved manifolds were developed. The following diagram shows one such carburetor stove, and its working principle is briefly described below. (The same parts in Figures A and B are indicated by the same letters.) Surrounding the outside of exhaust pipe A is an iron cylinder B. The inner diameter of the iron cylinder must be slightly larger than the outer diameter of the exhaust pipe. The iron cylinder is supported by the cylinder feet C and does not contact the exhaust pipe, leaving a considerable gap. D is a pipe, one end connected to cylinder C and the other connected to the carburetor's air intake. When the engine is in the intake stroke, outside air enters the iron cylinder from inlet E and passes through pipe D into the carburetor. Because the cylinder surrounds the exhaust pipe, the air is warmed as it passes. This warm air enters the carburetor and causes the gasoline that has already been sprayed into a mist to evaporate more easily. In some cars, the carburetor stove is not installed separately, but is directly cast as a whole unit with the exhaust. As for the pipe connecting the carburetor stove to the carburetor air intake, it is usually made of a flexible steel pipe specially used for this purpose. Although other carburetor stoves have different forms, their working principles are all the same.</p>
<p>To avoid insufficient or excessive heat supply to the carburetor system from the exhaust passing through the exhaust pipe, all cars are equipped with a management mechanism. The simplest and most common is a butterfly valve. The position of this butterfly valve is in the pipe connecting the exhaust pipe and the exhaust jacket. The driver can manage it from the front panel (i.e., the dashboard) through appropriate mechanical action. This device is very common, whether it is a combined exhaust and intake manifold or a heated intake manifold.</p>
<p>In short, to achieve fuel economy and perfect engine operation, the need for heat supply to the carburetor system has been unequivocally affirmed. While the efforts of past automobile manufacturers have made car service more perfect, the future improvements are truly boundless. Let's wait and see.</p>
