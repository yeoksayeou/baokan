<p>時評</p>
<h3>德國擴張軍備後之英國對德態度</h3>
<p>— 緯</p>
<p>當德國宣言成立空軍。與實行强迫軍役法後。法國輿論卽謂「最近由倫敦協定所獲得英法密切之合作。今已破壞。巴黎現擺動於兩極之間。一為莫斯科。一為倫敦。苟英法合作不能實現。則法俄合作。自然將繼之而成立。」此種論調。頗切事實。蓋英法有倫敦協定。法俄之交離而英法之交密。法所以不惜與英締結天空安全公約。願以法國空軍保障英國安全者。實希望英國贊助法國立塲。共同對付德國也。無如英國外交家。口惠而實不至。依然徘徊於兩者之間。不為左右袒。此在英固有其客觀與其主觀之原因。不得不出此。然而法之對英。未免因此失望矣。夷考英國之傳統政策。正如英國孚勒中將（Major-Ｇeneral　Fuller）所謂。（一）以民主政治之立塲。建立國內和平。（二）對於國際維持勢力均衡。（三）建文邊境安金。（四）維持海上覇權。（五）有自衛能力之自治殖民地任其自治。英國雖為世界民主政治之先進。然自世界經濟恐慌　擊英倫後。卽有舉國一致之內閣出現。而所謂政黨政治。已呈跛形。舉國一致內閣之目的。本在集中權力。應付國內經濟逆勢。然自成立以來三。載於茲。經濟昭蘇尙難如願。至於尾大不掉之自治領。如澳洲。加拿大等。在經濟上。有其個別利益。在政治上有其個別立塲。在外交上。有其個別政策。與母國之步調。不能完全一致。他如愛爾蘭。則獨立運動狂潮。迄未平靖。印度則其自治運動又突飛猛晉。凡此種種。皆足使不列顚政治家坐臥不安。故就英國國內情况而言。目下英實無暇他顧。亦不願他顧也。再就英國之。對外政策言之英國對歐陸維持勢力均衡與其本身之海軍優勢。早為世人共知之事實。自十六世紀英國戰勝西班牙之Armada以來。其大陸政策。常扶乙抑。甲如十九世紀之助普傾法。與二十紀初之助法傾德。乃其最顯著者也。大戰告終。法國獨霸歐陸。自英所不喜。英於此又施其傳統之政策。暗中抑法揚德。德國始而要求解除德國賠欵束縛。英則從中斡旋。洛桑協定吿成。德終如願以償。德國繼又要求軍備平等。英又從而附和。謂德應有其軍備平等權。及倫敦協定吿成。德亦終如願以償。此二者於德誠為有得。然於法則殊不利。故法為其自身安全計。為防制德國複仇計。遂不得不嚶鳴求其同好。此法俄互助協定之所以經過幾度波折而終於最近成立也。</p>
<p>法俄互助協定之成立。雖名義上根據盟約而產生。然按之互助協定條文第三條。「簽約國如未經挑釁。遭受侵略時。應依照國聯盟約第十六條（卽對於侵略國施行財政經濟及軍事制裁。）第十七條第三項（對於非會員國亦得施行第十六條之規定）之規定實行互助。」實際上乃一含有軍事同盟性質之條約也。此次法俄互助協定之成立。直接固為德國所促成。而間接實亦為英國所助成。蓋英國態度如果不如此之捉摸不定。則法國之態度未必如斯之堅决。而法俄互助公約亦未必能如此汛速吿成也。今法俄互助協定已告成文矣。英國是否猶持其光榮孤立之政策。此實値得注意之問題也。德國在重整空陸軍後。復重整海軍。其建造十二艘之潛水艇。乃勢所必然。德國重整陸軍。大不列顚之政治家。猶叮强自鎭定。至其重整海軍則必反對。可斷言也。</p>
<p>吾人細察目前歐洲形勢。英國外交。不外兩途（一）與法合作。如一九一四年之前事。德國海軍。欲壓倒英國。因而與法有默契。共同對德。（二）卽仍與德舉行談判。以最大之容忍。最寬之條件。滿足德國之願望。使其投向英國所主張之集體安全旗幟下。今就英外相前日（五月三日）在國會竭力主張與德妥協維持歐洲和平之。演說觀之英國外交之政策。仍趨向後者而不變。特不知德國今後能否如不列顚之所願而就範耳。吾人猶憶一九一四年大戰之前夕。英外相格雷爵士。猶致書當時駐德大使高期泰。命其向德國當局進行調解。然而為時不久。奧國宣戰矣。德國動員矣。俄國動員矣法國應戰矣。英國乃終於捲入戰爭之漩渦。今英國之國內困難。亦猶戰前。英國之不顏戰爭。亦如戰前。所不可知者。乃德國今後之措施如何耳。故「火戰之機决於德國」一語。雖不免言過其實。然確含相當之眞理也。</p>

<p>河北全省二十四年度總預算、一再改編、求收支適合、但全省收入、不足一千八百萬元、支出則為二千三百萬元、相差約五百餘萬？財廳召集全省各關係機關會議多次、擬從裁員减政方面、撙節適符、惟其結果、各機關均聲述困難、員不能再裁、政亦無法可减、推延數月、財　始籌得一策、卽緩付本年各到期外債、此種欵項總計約五百萬元以上、支出旣省、預算乃得編訂適合，上週內經省屬各廳開會審核通過、轉呈財部核示、一俟批准之後實施、冀省收入大宗、計田賦每年為六百飭萬元、牙雜各　為五百餘萬元、營業稅為六十餘萬元、牙稅於卜年度起、改徵牙行營業稅、雜稅取消包商制、改制後、收入或將减少、春來各地旱風大作、禾稼多損、直接影響農村經濟、間接則影響田賦之徵收、各縣商業亦極凋幣、故本年度財政難關、雖已渡過、下年恐仍不免掣襟見肘矣、（二日）</p>

<p>市長播音</p>

<h3>盛毓常　被妾控案訉結　盛妾患病甚重　傭婦扶持到庭</h3>
<p>廣東子女林玉金、今年廿七歲、早年在粵妓院爲妓、於十六歲時、經蘇石痴之介紹、下嫁清末宮保武進人杏蓀之長孫盛毓常（今年三十八歲、佳貝常路一號、）為妾、至民國十四年十九歲時、因盛之姬妾擠軋下堂、脫離後因生活艱難、入大滬舞場充當舞女、一二八滬戰後、盛往大滬舞場跳舞、與林女意見、廻念舊情、盛又給資重收覆水、租賃霞飛路一百九十一號（即仁和里西首貝勒路口已開進化藥房樓上）、按月由盛給與生活費用、不是前往盤玩、智商年四月止、盛忽</p>
<p>絕跡不去</p>
<p>對日用費亦斷絕不給、而女又患肺病、經屢次找盛、難見其面、從此恨盛喜怒無常、乃延華懋生律師代理理具狀特二法院刑庭、對盛毓常提起遺棄罪之自訴、請求依法訊辦、并附帶民訴、法院據狀、於本年一月十二日、有章朝佐推事開庭、傳集兩造到案詳訉、被告否認脫離後再在舞場遇見租屋同居之事、自訴人方面、提出二房東陳張氏同居之曹福生等到案作證、庭論改期著雙方</p>
<p>在外和解</p>
<p>各情已詳誌翌日本報、在自訴人林玉金之肺病、比前增重、又患心臟病、因無力醫治、經人介紹入中德醫院、免費留院治療、此案昨日又奉章推事開庭續審、雙方各偕律師到案、但自訴人因病精神萎靡。由舊傭婦王愛寶攙扶到案、坐而受訊、據自訴人稱、於十六歲嫁與被告、至民國十四年十九歲時脫離、由被告寫好筆據、逼勒我簽字、脫離之後、我向小姊妹借錢度日、不得已入</p>
<p>大滬舞塲</p>
<p>充舞女、至一二八後、被告偕一女人同至大滬舞塲跳舞、與我見面、被告命彼同來之女人給我洋二百元、至第二次被告來時、我始向被談話、求他憐念處景困苦照應、被告即允許租屋同居、給與生活費用、旋與被告同去租借霞飛路一百九十一號、他允許恢復舊情原狀、將前立筆據取銷、約我暫住一陣之後、再接到宅內同住、至上年四月起、他見我病重、即絕跡不來、棄之不顧、請求依法辦他應得之罪云云、并據其代理律師向庭聲稱撤回附帶民訴、訊之被告、承認</p>
<p>娶自訴人</p>
<p>爲妾、當時出資三千元、至十四年、她自願無條件脫離而去、一二八以後、外間時事不好、我在家深居簡出、從未到過舞塲、問、你共有幾個女人是同居一處的麽、答、共有三個女人分局的、問、上次命你外出和解的、答、上次開庭之後、我屢接恐嚇電話、代理律師亦接到恐嚇信、因之無從進行和解、問、自訴人現在病至這樣狀態、你能於道德上援助他麼、答、她有種種不利於我及恐嚇、故庭上又傳訊證人即扶伴自訴</p>
<p>不願援助</p>
<p>人之傭婦王愛寶據供、在原告處幫傭、被告於上年四月以前時常來的、四月以後、即不來了、有一次他命我買雪芥烟、我買錯香烟回來、他還責駡我的云云、至此、庭上命開辯論、據自訴代理人華懋生律師等辯論關鍵、稱被告既與自訴人恢復舊地位、而同居、則自訴人妾之地位仍在、乃被告見自訴人患病如此是之重、竟棄之掉首不顧、若旁人見自訴人病至如此、無依無靠、於道德上人情上亦應援助救濟之、而況被告耶、故被告應該負刑事責任、請求依刑法三百十條第二項遺棄罪判處被告罪刑云云、繼由被告律師辯護後、庭上即宣告終結、定期八日宣判、論畢退庭、</p>

<h3>怎樣做一個小科學家？</h3>
<p>— 象子</p>
<p>小朋友！你喜歡科學嗎？你羨慕牛頓，愛迪生的偉大嗎？我想，有志氣的小朋友回答我的一定是：「喜歡的，羨慕的，我也要做一個小科學家。」</p>
<p>但是，匠人要造一所屋子，他必須預先打好了基礎。然後，再把屋子架上去，不然這屋子准會塌下來，永遠沒有成功的一天。</p>
<p>所以，要做小科學家，先要把科學的基礎弄結實了才行，但是科學的基礎是什麼呢？就是你們在學校裏唸的算學，自然和勞作諸科。科學上最重要的是精密和準確，一絲一毫都不能夠弄錯：况且有許多學理都從算學裏推測來的，所以科學和算學處處須相輔而行的，缺了它可不成功。自然裏包括的是動物，植物，礦物，和物理化學，這些都是科學上研究的對象，尤其是後面幾種更見重要，因爲是基礎的主要原料。勞作是帮助你思想的發展，和養成實習的習慣，科學是晚不了「想」和「做」二項的。</p>
<p>現在，你應當在學校裏，很用心的注意這幾項，那末，做小科學家的基礎已經打好，就夠資格做一個小科學家了。</p>
<h3>不要工資的鐘表匠</h3>
<p>— 沈承昭</p>
<p>親　愛的小朋友們，世界上不論那一種工匠，沒有不要工資的，可是，美國的汽車大王亨利福特在幼年時候却做過不要錢的鐘表匠。有一次他的爸爸很嚴厲地責備他，說：</p>
<p>「亨利，你不要這麼愚笨，世界上那有一件酬勞都沒有的事情，也甘心情願幹嗎？」</p>
<p>「爸爸，我覺得修理鐘表有無限的愉快呵！」亨利回答着說。</p>
<p>亨利的爸爸很是動怒，最後把他禁錮在家中，不放他出門去了。然而亨利如何肯拋棄他那心愛的機械呢？一到晚上全家睡覺的當兒，他就悄悄地爬下床來，到降近人家修表去了。一直到深更半夜才回家。</p>
<p>有一次，他幹到隣村修表，等到把表修好，已經到了晚上二點多鐘。他匆匆地走回家去，不料天忽下起大雨來了，河中水漲到橋梁上來啦！亨利稍不留神便跌了下去，幸虧掙扎得上岸，但衣服却濕透了。回到家裏，給父親大罵一頓。從此他便不能偷着出去修理鐘表了。</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友們，不論研究甚麽技能，總得非常熱心和努力工作，絕不可稍有報酬的心理。亨利福特便是這樣研究科學的。</p>

<h3>灰塵從哪裏來？</h3>
<p>— 何公超</p>
<p>在前期的本刋上，登過一篇講「灰塵的稿子，不過好像沒有講起灰塵是哪裏來的。現在我來講一講：</p>
<p>世界上哪一個地方沒有灰塵？這些灰塵大部份是從火山裏噴出來的：山上的石頭受風雨的剝蝕，也會變成微細的灰塵：天空裏面，每天有許多許多的隕星，一面燃燒，一面就變成灰塵，像撒鹽一般落到地面上來，不過我們的眼睛看不見罷了：還有，城市裏面的灰塵比鄉下多，因爲城市中姻囱多，鄉下姻囪少，姻囱也是出產灰塵的地方。</p>
<p>灰塵自己沒有翅膀，而是由風吹送着，吹送到仳界各處，所以世界各處沒有一處沒有灰塵。並且，灰塵還會合成一大羣一大羣的飛，你不相信麽？我講一件故事給你聽：</p>
<p>據說在二十世紀的初年，北非洲發生了一次大風，它把一百八十萬噸的灰塵吹到歐洲，使它散佈於全個歐洲大陸，有些灰塵一直飛到離開它出身的地方有二千五百英里之遠。</p>
<p>那末，灰塵究竟有害於人類呢，還是有益於人類，說來奇怪，人類竟是少不了灰塵的。空氣裏的灰塵太多了，於衛生上有妨碍，這是大家知道的。但是我們更要知道：沒有灰塵，就不會下雨。爲什麽呢？因爲空氣中的水蒸氣變爲雲的時候，都是以塵埃爲中心，凝集攏來而生水滴的，如果沒有灰塵，不是就凝不成雨了麽？</p>
<h3>紙的來源</h3>
<p>— 之萬</p>
<p>一天，寶哥問爸爸說：</p>
<p>『爸爸！我每天看見垃圾堆裏有許多小孩子很當心的在找什麽東西？』</p>
<p>『孩子他們是在找紙的原料啊！』</p>
<p>『什麽，這般骯髒的破布堆，怎樣可以製造紙呢？』</p>
<p>『是的，你的練習簿上的潔白紙張，都是由個一個孩子所收集的　布屑做成的。他們先把破布聚在一起後，分出可以做好紙頭或做粗紙　種。它們先經過充分的浸洗，然後放在機器裏，使它們變成細片，再在磨石下磨成細碎，於是放在水裏，把它們弄成一種湯漿一樣。</p>
<p>爸爸呷了一口茶，又繼續下去。</p>
<p>『可是這漿是灰色的，要成功自色，必須經漂白這步手續。再在另一部機器裏把這漿的水在篩裏濾去，破布湯又變成一種氈般的東西。還有一部像圓柱的壓力機把這氈壓平，壓得極薄，等它乾後，再經過機器的磨光，就變成美麗的紙了。』</p>
<p>賓哥方才完全明瞭，紙是怎樣做的。他自言自語道：『我們不要忘記拾破布的孩子才好呀！』</p>
<h3>對話</h3>
<p>— （養浩）</p>
<p>母：「好孩子，誰欺侮了你而哭呀？」</p>
<p>孩子：「哥哥將我的洋囡囡打碎了」。</p>
<p>母：「哦！哥哥這樣頑皮的！他怎樣打碎的呢」？</p>
<p>孩子：「我用洋囡囡打他的頭，他的頭就把我的洋囡囡打碎了」。</p>
<p>母：「……」</p>
<h3>兒童科學講座火</h3>
<p>— 林蔭</p>
<p>我　們生活上所離不開的東西，當然很多，火就是其中之一。說到火，眞是伴希奇的東西。火的用處，大家一定都想得到（圖一）：晚上不點火，黑暗得不能行動，煮飯沒有火，飯米生硬不能吃。濕的東西，可以用火烤乾，冷的天氣可以生火取暖。要是沒有火的話，我們也許要活不成了！</p>
<p>原始時代的聰明人，發明了火。有的擊石取火，有的鑽木取火。（圖二）在我們現在看起來，他們是多笨拙呀！不像我們現在只要把火柴一劃，就生了火。（圖三）其實，他們正是我們的恩人呢？假如那時，他們不發明火我們恐怕不會，利用火來增加，我們生活上的幸福例！</p>
<p>聰明的小朋友也許會問我：「火是怎樣來的呢？」是的，這是一個有趣的問題。我簡單的回答：「物質在空氣中，和養氣化合而燃燒，發生出光和熱來，這現象就是火！」所以火沒有餐氣，就不會燃燒。養氣好像是火的生命。你把燃着的火柴，放進呵過氣的玻璃杯去，這火柴立刻會熄掉。圖四）因爲從我們嘴裏呵出來的空氣，已經沒有養氣的綠故呀！</p>
<p>火在燃燒的時候，必有火焰。而這火焰內外口的熱度，溫熱完全不同，火焰近外部，溫度最高，因爲外部的空氣供給很足，內部離空氣遠，溫度就較低了。（圖五）</p>
<p>火是我們生活中不可缺少的東西，但我們必須善於利用它，而且也必須小心防範他。否則，一不當心的時候，發生火災的時候，小則燃燒衣服物件，大則焚燒房屋，灼傷人體，那就很危險了！（圖六）</p>
<h3>玩泡泡</h3>
<p>— 張友鑑</p>
<p>一·肥兒和榮兒到店裏去買橡皮泡泡，榮兒買了一個小的，肥兒却要買一個最大的。</p>
<p>半路上，肥兄見榮兒也和自己一樣在玩着泡泡，於是格外走得快些，想使榮兒慌忙了，把泡泡拍碎。</p>
<p>三·不料正這樣的想着，脚下被一塊石頭絆住，便跌了）交，自己的大泡泡却破碎了。</p>
<h3>小妹妹奏凱歸來</h3>
<p>— 汪瘦秋</p>
<p>前幾天，江蘇全省禁姻委員會，爲着宣傳禁姻起見，特地舉辦了一個江蘇全省中學生禁姻演說比賽，江蘇各地的中學，都派着代表去參加。</p>
<p>江蘇省立的南京女子中學初中三年級乙班裏，有一位張淑寶小姐，今年纔十四歲。伊是湖南人，但是生長在北平，所以她的北平話講得很流利。這一次，伊被全校的師生選作參加江蘇全省中學生禁姻演說的代表，在全省好幾位代表中，伊竟以正確的姿勢：流利的國語；動人的講題：而獲得第一名，並且得到十幾種獎品，我們勞苦功高的軍事委員會蔣委員長，也獎給伊一座「苦口婆心」的銀盃，中央黨部執行委員會和監察委員會獎給伊一面「除惡務盡」綢旗：小朋友們！你想這是多麼榮譽的一件事啊！</p>
<p>在幾十位代表中，張小姐的年齡最小，但是伊竟獲得第一，可知無論什麽事情，小朋友們並不弱於大朋友，所以希望小朋友們不要自暴自棄，以爲我的年紀還小哪！</p>
<h3>動物瑣話</h3>
<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>虎形像貓，全身作黃金色，有濃黑色的橫紋，是最兇猛的食肉獸，喜歡殺害他獸而食，雖然壯腹已經食飽，也常常要去把弱小獸咬殺的。虎的身體比獅子爲大，性亦比獅子爲兇很，它常利用其毛色的保護，躱在草藪密林中，伺候他獸。雄虎尾端無鬣毛，頭比雌爲圓，生產於印度朋加爾地方的虎，毛色尤爲美麗，東三省朝鮮所產的，稍帶白色。因爲便利行走於雪林之中，能耐酷寒，到了冬季，毛更緊密而長，波斯產的虎與馬來半島產的虎，體形稍小，，但非常獰猛，普通等捕殺羚羊野猪鹿等爲食物，食量很大，一週間能食肥牛兩頭，如野牛在林中被殺，它一次吃不完時，食後就用草葉遮　在剩下來的骸肉上，以防到別處去後，爲他獸所吃。記憶力很强，到了肚飢時，仍舊回到原地方，所以獵人倘若看見有死默殘骸的地方，就可以設計捕到的。虎看見人類，不會先來害人，倘若人類突然的去驚嚇它，那末，就要爲其所害，又在饑餓的時候，要吃人的。獵虎的方法甚多，大概多用網與陷阱二法爲最相宜，陷阱法先在林旁掘好一十尺深的洞，洞底密挿銳利的竹槍，洞口上面遮蓋草葉，與草原同樣，虎出去覓食時，看見有人來，急急想避到草原，於是陷人洞裏去了。平時在太陽未出以前，與日沒後夜間，出而覓食，白天棲臥洞中不出。虎胎每次可生二三小虎，初生時背部爲鮮黃色黑紋，胸部辛顎爲純白色。母虎對小虎，非常親暱，敎以種種敎育，如用舌舐脚洗面與捕鳥獸方法，所以從小捕來的小虎，可以在家中飼養馴良，與貓狗一樣的。前年到上海表演的德國海京伯馬戲團、稱海京伯爲猛獸的爸爸，他曾經把養熟的虎，送給美國的動物園，過了兩年，他到動物園去遊玩，那虎突然看見海京伯來，立刻爬上鐵欄干，好像有無限的感傷樣子，這是猛獸不忘舊誼的表示啊。</p>
<h3>機關手槍的製法</h3>
<p>— 凱立</p>
<p>小　朋友！我知道你們是很愛玩具的，所以想出了一個簡單而有趣的機關手槍的製造方法。我現在拿這奇怪的勞作，用淺近的圖畫和文字來說明它的內容及構造稈序。</p>
<p>材料，約半寸直徑的竹管一支，舊鐘發條一根，鐵絲一根，和普通木料少許　裝置，將竹管截成三寸長，如圖（一）。將一寸長之鋼條挿入一三分直徑的木旋軸上，如圖（二）。任意製一木手槍柄，務使適合自己的手。然後拿一塊圓柱體的木料，長要在三寸以內，用刀挖空。在距離底八分左右處，結一根鐵絲。裝上木柄，如圖（三）。取零星木料，削成七分長三分直徑的木彈十數顆，彈頭須成尖銳形，如圖（四）。裝置後如圖（五）。</p>
<p>用法，先拿木彈裝入放彈口中，約五顆，於是搖動木旋軸，鋼條因受鐵絲的阻止前進，彈力漸漸增加，等到脫出鐵絲的障礙，它就能狠力的向木彈頭上猛擊了一下。因此木彈就從竹管裏很快的飛了出去。如果旋軸不斷地搖着。那末彈也能不斷地向外飛了。</p>
<h3>水手辛白德傳（一六）</h3>
<p>— 心青</p>
<p>在二三天內有一艘船駛過。我立時將頭巾的布做了一面旗子，借此給船上的人知道我正在求助。</p>
<p>那班人瞧見了我，便派一艘小艇來載我上船去。我並不告知他們放入壙中的事，只和他們說兩天以前從一艘破船上冲激到海邊，但是設法將我帶的黃金寶石保住了。</p>
<p>我們開駛出去，屆時就到了甘拉島上，在那邊我們發見了很好的鉛鑛，又見許多產生障的樹。住任此地的人民，是吃人肉的。</p>
<p>末後我們回到了巴克達，身體康健，而貨物富足。我爲了表示感謝上帝的保佑我起見，出錢布施窮人，於是在家庭生活的樂趣中銷磨我的光陰了。</p>
<p>辛白德的第五次航行</p>
<p>但是這種生活於我太覺呆滯了，因此我决意再出去一次。這回我造了一艘船供自己之用，將我所帶的貨物都放在艙中。可是那船中還有餘地，我就帶了幾個人和他們的貨物一同上船</p>
<p>我們開駛時恰是順風，不多時便到了一座美好的島上。有幾個人跑上海岸去，在那邊我們便發見了一個大鵬的蛋，簡直像我在那寶石的山谷中所見的那個蛋一樣大。蛋中有一頭小鵬在着，那嘴突出在殼外。</p>
<p>同我在一起的那些人瞧見了這個，便取了一柄斧頭打破了蛋殼。於是他們取出那小鵬來吃了一餐。任是我說着，他們儘是做這件事；在他們宴畢之前，天已漸漸地暗了，在相去若干遠的所在，我們所瞧見的，以爲是兩抹很大的雲。</p>
<p>我那水手中的頭領知道這兩抹雲是甚麼。</p>
<p>他呼道，『快快上船去！這些暗雲是維鵬雌鵬，要是它們瞧見了我們，便得傷害我們了』。</p>
<p>我們急急。的上了船，立時開行：然而我們仍是太遲了。那些鵬見它們的小鵬死了，部悲哀欲狂；它們立刻飛開去，抓了大石塊在它們的脚爪中。</p>
<p>於是它們飛在船的上面，我們可以瞧到它們的計劃是要使石塊落在船面上沈沒我們。有一塊石落在水中激起很大的浪來，但有一塊擊在船上，只爲勁兒太大，竟使伊破裂而立時沈沒了。</p>
<p>那些人在大石落下時沒有喪命的，便和那船一同沈下。這便是我的命運，但我再浮起來時，就抓了一塊木，堅持着以保名貴的性命。風和潮水掃我前去，末後便拋擲在一座海島的邊岸上。</p>

<h3>對意大利獎勵早婚的感想</h3>
<p>— 蔡恒</p>
<p>世界大戰，使歐洲參戰的國家减少了千百萬個的壯丁，一方面因爲戰後百業凋弊，德法意等國，這種情形更加嚴重，獨身生活者，日益增加，人口　形减少，這不是靑年男女們沒有結婚的的需要，而賽因戰後經濟困難和近年來深刻的不景氣的影響。在現在社會制度之下，一般女子以結婚爲生活的出路，婚後的日常一切消費，大部由男子負担，並且婚後的生育兒女，更足以加重負担，窮困靑年，以結婚爲異途，因之晚婚，永遠的獨身，與人口减少，形成了戰後歐洲的嚴重問題。政府當局爲謀民族的生存和準備世界第二次大戰爭，不能不極力地獎勵結婚，提倡早婚，和獎勵多產主義了。</p>
<p>最近報載國民社羅馬電：「意大利今日成爲蜜月國，　有二千對以上之新夫婦，由法西斯黨供給費用，共度假日也。新婚夫婦，每對可得五百呂拉，此係政府獎勵結婚計劃中之一部。」又路透社電：「昨日羅馬共有二千三百五十三對男女行給婚禮，蓋遵行法西斯「早婚」與「大家庭」之標語也。新夫婦大都年不滿二十五歲，且有若干，年僅十六者。」</p>
<p>實行早婚，和大家庭制度，這不是我國的封建制度麽？而這種制度，居然提倡在二十世紀的法西斯蒂的意國，這不能不說是近代的「奇觀」，但是當我們考察一下實際情形之後，便覺得這也有他的社會的根原：因爲近來國際形勢，列强競爭軍備，爭奪領土，頂備第二次世界大戰爭，所以加　度的繁殖意大利民族，也不外是準備戰爭的一面，因此才有「婦女們回到家庭裏去」的標語！回到家庭裏去，加緊地製造未來的「砲灰」和「肉彈」在帝國主義者的心目中，這是婦女們唯一的工作，婦女們是不用參加社會上的事業的，祇要埋頭在家庭裏，趕快製造「砲灰」和「肉彈」就是了。在意大利民族主義下的婦女們，可以說：巳成了造軍用「肉彈」的機器了！</p>
<p>但是，我們還是不能沒有疑慮：新夫婦得到政府的獎金，固然可以度過蜜月旅行，可是今後的生活問題呢？在全世界嚴重的失業漩渦裏面，這幾千對的新婚夫婦，婚後都能得着相當的職業麽？要不然，今天是快樂的蜜月旅行的神仙，明天也許就變成失業地獄的桎梏了的囚犯的。</p>
<p>意大利當局爲着要在表面上裝飾昇平，同時鼓勵生育，加强戰備，於是就有了這種「二千三百五十對」集團結婚的空前盛舉，可是這種表面的花絮，對於失一業問題和勞苦婦女的生活究竟有些什麽利益？世界的不景氣依然如故，大戰的危機依然如故，社會的根本問題，是不能用表面的　飾而掩蓋的。</p>
<h3>劉景桂情殺案判决感言</h3>
<p>— 茲九</p>
<p>三月十六日劉最桂在北平志成中學槍殺逯明的妻子滕爽一案，現經北平地方法院宣判：對劉景桂的「預謀殺人」認爲情狀可憫，依法减原刑（死刑）二分之一，處以最低徒刑十二年。逯明無罪。對逯的判决，聞檢察官方面，將不服上訴，對劉的判决，似乎巳公認了。</p>
<p>然而社會人士中，也有對劉景桂案的判决，認爲未免寬容的。理由是：「所謂預謀殺人，本是深謀遠慮的意思，所以刑法規定，處以極刑的。且對景桂與逯明訂婚不久，即從事發生肉體關係，此後逯明與滕爽結婚，逯劉間又經過相當手續——解除婚約。受取償金。但仍會與逯姦宿旅舍，有數日之久，自己浪漫不檢，反集怨毒於無辜的滕爽，一再尋殺，連擊七槍。殘酷凶狠，實無可悲憫。這種减刑，將會給社會以獎勵犯罪的惡影響。」這些話，組看，似乎很對：劉景桂的殺人，事前的深謀遠慮，事後的從容不迫，被審時的侃侃而言，似乎值得說：「其情狀至爲可惡」，當處以極刑。另一方，劉景桂的行爲，似乎不免浪漫，以自己的浪漫行徑，不得逯明的專愛，而一再尋殺無辜的滕爽，配稱「凶人」。這種可惡的凶人，似乎眞應該殺一警百，給後來者一個借鑑。其實每偶人的行爲，都受環境的支配，劉景桂一方旣受封建思想的支配，覺得一經與人發生肉體關係，非嫁他不可，讀她的供詞，有「我自已是失掉了貞操的人」，我决定同他拚個你死我活，」以及「親友們總以爲僅訂婚約，解除無妨，實不知我們巳超過了婚姻關係。」等話就是明證。另一方面，男女戀愛，本來只要一到相當年齡，誰也會知道的，劉逯當不能例外。然而社會上的封建勢力，依然處處作怪。男女間的戀愛，依然不能自由。這里受害最大的，當然是女子。所以，我們寗可說，劉景桂就是這新舊衝突，矛盾百出的時代社會的犧牲品。因此，社會若依舊如故，殺一不足以警百的。</p>
<p>不過社會本可支配人，同時人也可以創造社會。靑年男女，以戀愛的精神，殺人自殺的勇氣，來創造社會。不難有實現的一日吧。有人以爲現在的少爺小姐，他們的生活環境，只許可他們談淡戀愛，興興醋海，此外他們已無所要求了。這裏我想借柯崙泰的一句名言：「事業大於戀愛」來奉勸靑年，尤其女靑年。至於什麽是我們的事業，只得讓每個人自己去求索了。</p>

<h3>第三節封建的家庭婦女與結婚</h3>
<p>— 君慧</p>
<p>「一切宗敎，祗不外是支配人類日常生活的外部的力，空　地反映於人類底頭腦裏面的東西，換句話說，就是地上之力採天上之力的形態的一種反映物」。（反杜林論）</p>
<p>中世紀的基督敎，也正是當時的領主和晨奴，貴族和賤民的絕對隷屬的生活關係，空想地反映於他們的頭腦裏面的東西。換言之，地上的封建領主權力採取天上的上帝權力的形態的一種反映物。</p>
<p>基督敎的偶像神——上帝，在中世紀，的確是一唯我獨尊一的最高權力者，牠統治中世社會，正如希特勒統治現代德國一樣，是絕對的，獨裁的！人們對上帝是祗許信仰而不准批判，只有服從而不得反抗！可是這偶像權力的直接行使者乃是地主，貴族，佾侶，三位一體的封建國家！上帝是魄儡而巳！</p>
<p>就基督敎的起源看來，基督自身，無疑的是爲解放猶太被壓迫民族而犧牲共性命的偉大的革命者。可是到後來，他們不肖門徒們却把他的乎心中流出來的血，向當時的統治階級廉價出賣，於是乎基督敎便成了封建國家川以統治被壓迫大衆的工具。一切敎會的制度，儀式及敎義，都使之適合於支配階級的胃口，而對於被壓迫大衆，尤其婦女，則遂行了最大的欺騙與侮蔑的任務。</p>
<p>基督敎對於婦女的侮辱和欺騙，是最刻面可惡的，上帝在愛典樂園創造了亞當　娃的第二天，便把一切的罪惡加在夏娃身上。說女人是誘惑男子的罪惡之根源。女人是不凈者，招世界的罪惡，招男子的禍害的誘惑者。</p>
<p>有名的敎父泰爾特利安（Terulien）對於婦女的宣言中，有如下的一段話：</p>
<p>「你們應當曉得，你們是夏娃。上帝對於女人的判决。到今日還存在着：因此，你們的罪也仍然存在着！你們是惡魔的支配之門！你們是破壞了禁戒的樹果，你們是最於犯了神的法律，你們是誘惑了惡魔也不敢接近的男子，你們是弄壞了神的形像的男子。」</p>
<p>基督敎是不僅把女人當作罪惡之機源，並且把娣女當作同牛馬一樣的男子的所有物。舊約的十誠中第九誡這樣寫着：</p>
<p>「不可貪戀人家的房屋，也不可貪戀人家的妻子，僕婢，牛馬以及其他一切所有物」。</p>
<p>這樣把妻子和牛馬放在一起，婦女是屬於男子的牛馬一樣的物件！</p>
<p>特別有趣的，是紀元五八五年在馬孔（Macou）的長老會議中，討論婦女有沒有靈塊的問題，發生爭執，但僅以一票的多數决定女子也有靈魂的人類。但敎會法仍然規定「婦女並不是仿照神的原型而創造的東西。」</p>
<p>基督敎對於封建的親族法，亦盡其侮辱婦女的能事。基督敎是在婦女對男子的絕對的隷屬關係上面，設定了一夫一妻制的婚姻制度，這在男子方面，自然是名目上的一妻制，而實際上是多妻制。中世紀英國的婚姻法中有如下的規定。</p>
<p>「若女人犯奸通罪的時候，其處罰權一任於該女人的丈夫之乎？」</p>
<p>可是男子犯奸通罪的時候，其處罰權却屬於神的意思。關於這點，英國的敎父葉爾布利克是很巧妙的加以解釋。</p>
<p>「如同夫處罰奸通的妻一樣，上帝也處罰姦通的丈夫一。</p>
<p>可是上帝如何處　奸通的丈夫呢？這是無從知道的謎！而丈夫處罰奸通的妻是嚴酷的肉體的刑罰。據謝西夸夫的話，封建領主在出外期中爲防止妻的奸通，特別用貞操帶附在女人身上，倘有不貞行爲，則將她毒打或處死！</p>
<p>基督敎是一手傘着侮蔑婦女的聖經，一手撫摩女人的額頂，說「你們是罪惡之淵藪，贖罪之道只有順服，現世的順服乃是來世的天堂！」這種說敎對於絕對被壓迫者的歸女是很有效果的！因爲對於現實世界已經絕望了的中世紀的婦女們，是很容易接受夾世的「安眠藥」自行麻醉！這樣基　敎是要把婦女解放到來世的天堂上去，這裏有牠的獨特的欺騙性質！</p>

<h3>大晚報「女學生座談會」讀後感</h3>
<p>— 茜</p>
<p>記得數星期前，大晚報婦女週刋曾出過了一次「女店員座談會」讀後，並不覺有什麼特點。三月二十六日晚又讀着它的「女學生座說會」，覺得這一次非說幾句話不可。</p>
<p>一個標題爲「女學生生活之面面觀」的女學生座談會的主要成員，却只有四個人，而這四位又只是代表兩個學校，這兩個學校中，一個是敎會學校。當然在這宗敎大抬其頭，超現實的勢力，巳漸次恢復它們過去榮耀的地位的今日，把敎會學校的實生活對人揭示一些，也未免不是很有意義的。不過，該座談會中，敎會學校的學生DC二女士竟在乘機對記者先生們說敎，而我們堂堂的記者先生對於宗敎竟一點正確的發揮也沒有，我敢說，這不得不說是該座談會所以失敗的原因。</p>
<p>我們。且看作爲敎徒的CD二女士如何爲敎會學校以及她們的宗敎鼓吹宣傳，同時亦可看出二女士所受的麻醉到了若，何程度。（以下全錄該座談會原文）</p>
<p>「D　我最歡喜宗敎科學及社會學。因爲研究宗敎的人，以服社會爲前提，所以我們必須研究社會學，我們以宗敎爲背景，對社會事實，加一點的研究，我們相信宗敎的力量，可以改造社會一。</p>
<p>「C　我們研究社會科學，研究宗敎，目的就是要爲社會謀福利，爲社會工作。」</p>
<p>「D　人家以爲敎會學較裏是很束縛的，可是我們只覺得很忙，不覺得束縛。」</p>
<p>「D　諸位先生，都是對於文學有研究的，我可以提出一個問題來嗎？我覺得一個人如果沒有信仰，一個人是很容易消極的，譬如新女性影片的新女怪，她要是有了信仰，决不至於自殺。」。</p>
<p>當然有正確知識的人，對於「信仰」决不會像被麻醉了的D女士那樣以爲所謂「信仰」就只有「信耶穌信上帝」的信仰，我們知道除信神以外，還可有更好的信仰呢。</p>
<p>讀書CP兩女士的談話，令我們知道了帝國主義文化侵略的力量，即是麻醉作用，在各敎會學校的學生中是如何的深入。她們幾乎人人都可作一個街頭宜敎師了。最近基督敎在中國的更抬頭　深入。我們還可舉出一個確　的證據。大晚報二十六晚「日日談」攔有這麽一段記事：</p>
<p>「聖經銷數激增　英國與外國聖經公會去年　在世界各處，共售去聖經一〇·九七〇·六〇九册，而中國一處的銷數竟達四·二九六·四九五册，較前年增三九四·二〇〇册。去年的中國，百業蕭條，達於極點，聖經的銷數，却如此景氣。」</p>
<p>最後關於所謂在華作一爲社會謀福利，爲社會工作」的牧師們的眞實面目，我想借一個外國人所發表的言論來作結束罷：</p>
<p>大晚報四月十三日，載有倫敦路透電，謂英馬萊動　提出動議，題爲「中國應令自由聽其决定自已前途。」馬萊發言，對於在華之歐人牧師抨擊頗烈，有「敎士以世界所罕聞之一種極欺編能事的國際行爲，攪有在華之地位的天主敎某敎士所起草之中法文條約，規定約文意義以法文爲準者，載有一條，讀法文有之，而不見於華文，此條卽準許敎會置地是也。於是敎會購置最好地基，而以武力維持其所有權。又謂聞所未聞最惡劣的開擴行爲，更於安南見之。」云云。</p>
<h3>投奔</h3>
<p>— 子岡</p>
<p>「那麽，這可怎麽安排呢？」</p>
<p>這兩天，在一個裁縫店裏當女縫工的孫二嬸時常這樣嗟嘆，瞅着她發呆的孫二和他們的十四五歲的女兒也跟着太息起來。</p>
<p>「你們知道，我在這裏是傘着比男工少一半的工錢啊，要不然掌櫃的就肯用我？幾天的吃喝怎麼辦？你想的不錯，要家裏少個吃口就把順子送到我這兒來——她輕着聲音：一萬一掌櫃的再歇了我呵……」她留神着爲了丈夫和女兒的借住而惹來的白眼。</p>
<p>孫二抽抽着那紅鼻頭，抹抹乾皺的額角，用了不怕厭煩的勁兒和女人解釋：</p>
<p>「我有辦法也不送她出來了，就路費就花了五六塊，够多少糧食錢？可是，今年的地，哦，今年的地呀……」他用假作的嗆咳蓋住了由心底裏發出的悽傷，手指頭捻着靑布襖的破邊緣：去年秋麥沒政多種，怕又像頭兩年一樣由辛苦了不够，還被通得要死，但結果不是差點連自家吃的都還乾凈了麽？上月春麥稱上了，也沒敢多租地多賠人工，雖然這馬上又要種高粱種亞子，但也是彌補不過來的。」</p>
<p>放下正在繚邊的大褂，孫二嬸揉揉自己的老花眼睛，她想到順子底下的三個女兒，最小的才九歲。</p>
<p>「眞也呌不爭氣哩，四個賠錢的丫頭！」</p>
<p>「全是二眠過後的蠶一樣，正是吞飯的時候了啊，小四吃糙麵饅頭能一頓小半斤！怎麽養活！」孫二在慨嘆裏夾雜着喜悅地這麽唸道着，兒子與女兒在他倒是一樣，生活的艱苦磨剩了一個豁達的心胸，什麼子息香烟的他滿不在乎，自己只像寗靜地抽完一口快熄了的旱烟一樣，在等待着自己的睜眼睛的日子結束。</p>
<p>「有活兒給順子找一個也好啊，縫的布褂布　不壞啊！」</p>
<p>十五歲的順子安靜地坐在坑上，似懂似不懂地諦聽着爸媽的商議。最後不知怎麽迸出了一句：</p>
<p>「媽，我也　祿子媽一樣，伺候人去！」她只聽說同村的祿子媽是上城裏伺候人去的，有時還能往家裏稍帶個三塊四塊。</p>
<p>「沒有的事，沒出門子就給人使喚去？除非是賣了身價的丫頭，可是！」她紅了眼梢　下了一句話。。「孩子，媽能有方法是不把你往火坑十喪送的。」</p>
<p>孫二的紅鼻頭又動了：</p>
<p>「出門子吧，十五，哽，十五，說小也不小啦，湊合着行了！一撫着腦門子想：「你嫁過來時是十六吧？一</p>
<p>女人嘴角上的笑站住了不到！分鐘：「還提那個，早出門子也是多吃　頭，人沒長大先受多少層罪，公婆的，丈夫的，孩子的：如果命裏倒羅的話。」</p>
<p>「來說的倒不少，有的太大，有的太小，那回王大嫂要把順子說給她十三歲的牛子時候，順子哭了一宵理！」</p>
<p>女孩子捻着辮子梢，默默地不嚮，眼前糢糊地　現着一個拖鼻涕的淘氣孩子，那就是王大嫂預備說給順子作丈夫的小牛哩。</p>
<p>晚上，孫二嬸犧牲了夜工，和順子爹在街角商量定了一條沒有路的路。</p>
<p>「找婆家吧，好也罷，歹也罷，家裏去了一個吃飯的人總好點，一接着，當爸爸的又自解自慰地說：</p>
<p>「這年頭，姑娘大了在家也是担心，鬧起兵來沒處躱，出了門子　由人家操心去罷。」</p>
<p>女人蹙着眉，沒有眼淚。回到店裏把自己積着的八九塊錢和一副銀鐲子打點了出來，當第二天當着順子父女倆又走出胡同口時沉下嗓子，揉揉紅眼：</p>
<p>「各自投奔吧，顧不了那些了，怨誰！」</p>
<p>孫二嬸楞楞地站在台階上，往前面探望着，一重重的景象印出來：</p>
<p>十五歲的孩子坐了破紅轎，剩下的三個女孩張着三張空空的嘴，而孫二，又要仲着黃瘦的　臂到地裏忙着淋汗去了。</p>

<h3>對於科學玩具之希望</h3>
<p>— 吳鐵城</p>
<p>國有國風，政有政風，風者，一時一風氣，國民之風度，社會之風尙，羣衆之風格。其所表現者。縱爲一言一行，一事一物，極渺小平凡之至，第旣習與成風，蔚爲風尙，則風之所趨，縱有大力，莫之能摧。故憂時之士，無不以改良國家社會之風尙，爲救亡圖存之念務：而欲改良國家社會之風尙，則善培全國兒童之趣味風氣，若上海市科學玩具展覽恊會會所倡導之科學玩具運動，實不失爲極有意義之舉動也！</p>
<p>良以兒童者，國家未來之主人，民族繼起之生命，兒童天性好動，無不生機活潑，視「玩」爲其第二之生命。中國科學落從，敎育者於兒童玩具，未嘗視爲敎育上有力之工具，因陋就簡，不加改良，不思利用，一般兒童之所「玩」者，非粗惡之臉譜，則泥塑之菩薩：非泥塑之菩薩，則極無敎育意義之日常用具之典型而已！求其能富於近代思想，科學觀念，國家意識，民族精神者，渺不可得！斯誠兒童之不幸，抑亦敎育之奇恥已！</p>
<p>今當科學玩具展覽大會舉行之日，鐵城不敏，敢致其誠摯之希望：</p>
<p>第一，希望政府社會，特別是敎育家，深切認識兒童玩具與培養國風學風之密切關係，一致致力於科學玩具之提倡！</p>
<p>第二，希望兒童玩具與近代之工業藝術，發生極密切之聯繫，使兒童玩具科學化，工業化，藝術化！</p>
<p>第三，希望社會能承認兒童玩具爲兒童敎育之有力工具，而充分利用之。譬如吾民族所缺乏者爲近代的思想，科學的觀念，則當介紹最新科學利器之模型，寓反封建之思想於玩具，以貫輸而改善之。吾民族所需要者，爲國家的意識與民族的精神，則當取近代戰具，溶民族精神，製爲玩具，以激發兒童勇敢之精神，培養兒童愛國之情緒，增爲兒童自衛之本能，栽植兒童優良之性格，俾貢獻於吾民族之復興焉！</p>
<h3>兒童玩具展覽與兒教育之重要</h3>
<p>— 潘公展</p>
<p>國家的强弱盛衰，要以救育的優劣爲轉移；敎育的優劣，又要以兒童敎育措施的適當與否爲轉移。因爲兒童是國家的命脈，民族的萌芽。</p>
<p>在世界上的强國中，沒有不注重兒童敎育的。德意志要復興民族，希特勒則力倡兒童軍事化敎育：蘇俄是新興的國家，史太林於五年計劃中則增加兒童敎育的經費。這些都足以表示出兒童敎育的重要性。</p>
<p>本來敎育的目的，是在解除人生的缺憾，而達於眞美，善的境地。兒童敎育，是基礎敎育，是在餐成完善國民的發端。因爲兒童是天眞爛縵的，其本性是善的，如敎育得法，則可以發展其「善性，」而使他將來成爲國家有用的人物：如果敎育不當，則易使他染上惡習，而淹沒了他的「善性，」於是也就難免將來成爲社會上的害馬了。所以說：兒童敎育，就是「做人」的敎育的開始。進言之，兒童敎育，就是要養成兒童對於國家民族的基礎觀念，使兒童長成後服務社會，都能跟着合於國家民族需要的觀念去行動。</p>
<p>因此，我們就要注意到中國，是怎樣一個國家，然從可以知道環境的需要及採取的圖存方策。以中國現在的敎育來論，敎育是落後的。以經濟來論，經濟更陷於破產的地步，生產旣無發展，而泊來品日益激增，民生亦因之而日形凋敝，長此以往，不待帝國主義　　其銳利的武器，施行其殘暴的屠殺，中國也難免於滅亡的。</p>
<p>中國的情勢，旣如此其嚴重，那末，我們怎樣纔可以敎亡圖存呢？在此文化競爭，生產發達的時代，自非敎育不足以自救：更非發展工業，則無以　存。但是在此經濟破產，敎育落後的情况之下，將從何處着手？這沒不能不先從兒童敎育開始，而兒童敎育，又不能不從科學化着手。過去對於兒童敎育，多忽略了兒童科學情緒的啟發，致兒童天眞的心靈，活潑的身手都斷送犧牲於桎梏敎育之下，而科學技術亦遂陷於無從發展的境地了。</p>
<p>今後對於兒童敎育，應注意兒童的心理，在啟發其情緒，而不在機械式之敎授，蓋灌輸兒童科學的學識時，需要偏重於誘專而漸養成其科學頭腦觀念。無論家庭與學校，都應廣置科學玩具，　盡，以供兒童的玩賞，無形之中使其了解科學的功用與重要。此種功效，雖非具體：但此種無形的勢力，較之機械的敎授；要高强得多了。</p>
<p>此次舉行的上海市科學玩具展覽會，深悉兒童敎育過去錯誤之癥結與現在應採取的方後。自表面看來，此種展覽會雖是關於兒童玩具的陳列，但是意義上，則至深且鉅。因爲這已經是指明了中國民族復興的途徑，是要注重兒童科學化的敎育，以及培養工業上需要的科學人才爲目的。所以此次展覽會的作用，不但祇限於協助敎育的局部份之修正，乃是推進敎育根本之改良。這恰如西洋中古時代以神學爲敎育基礎，其後更代之以人文主義與古典主義；及近代蘇俄以工業爲全部敎育制度建設的基礎，是一樣的重要！因此，我們應當將此次展覽會精神推廣之，而普及於全國，以期養成全國科學化的兒童。</p>
<p>兒童們科學頭腦的養成，纔是國家轉强，民族復興的根本要圖！</p>
<h3>舉辦科學玩具展覽會的意義</h3>
<p>— 陳蓋民</p>
<p>科學是人類文明的靈魂，已有鈞一般的事實可以證明，這裏也用不到多說廢話。中國二千年來停滯於小農經濟社會及小手工業社會，所以科學上沒有驚人的供獻，也是理所必然勢所必至的。現在令人不解的就是興辦新敎育已經有三十餘年的歷史了，自從前淸時代開始努力於聲光化電之學以後，受過科學洗禮的人，不算很少的了，不但在小學校中就有什麽幾小時的自然科，而且一年年還有許多直接到科學發達的歐美各國去留學的，算來也已不少了。但是到現在世界科學史上，仍沒有中國人的份兒，（但偉斯的科學叢談中歷述世界各與發明科學的故事中國僅有幾椿傳說而沒有一樣發明）不要說發明就是在一般人對於科學智識的幼稚，也是可憐到萬分，任何一方而？都表現着反科學的現象，在這二十世紀科學世界的年代，科學這樣幼稚，一切都談不到，即使沒有列強來壓迫，即使沒有軍閥來割摒，這樣落後的民族，也是不能存在的。听以要復興中國，先從提倡科學始。</p>
<p>因爲數十年的新敎育，在科學上仍得不到些微的效果，於是便有人以爲中國人沒有科學的天才，中國民族不會學得好科學的。這種觀念根本是錯誤的。日本在六十年前第一次看見外國輪船駛入驚慌到幾於激成事變，這和中國在前淸末年上海人把淞滬鐵路的鐵軌和車輛沉諸打狗港中一樣可笑，不料過了數十年，日本已經趕上歐美各國了，而中國還如和從前一樣這不能說現在日本人的生理上與腦　上巳經和五六十年前換過樣子了。又如北美之黑人，原和非洲土人一樣愚蠢，可是北美自從解放黑奴以來，黑人在學術界上也漸漸　其頭角：再如印度民族，原與英德民族的雅利安種同出一源，近數世紀來，英德二國不住的飛躍，印度則陷於深淵，永不自拔，這樣看來可知民族的優劣在文化的前進或是落後，沒有什麽關係的，那麽中國沒有科學上的發盼，不在民族性格方而已　可以證明了。</p>
<p>既經不是關於民族性格的擾劣，他的原因　等是什麽呢？原因是什沒有科學的環境，沒有科學的訓練，僅僅在有限的學校生活階段中，僅僅靠幾本呆板的敎科書，不會引起科學的興趣，不會陶育科學的大才，更不會養成研究科學“心理。在童年時代沒有把他訓練好，到了成年就是　些科學智識結果祗有得些死的智識，不會成功活的應用。試看外國的孩子們，他們的舉動和習慣，根本和我國「少年老成」的孩子大不相同，他們好破壞，也好建設，他們不但在幼稚園和小學校中便有許多科學的環境訓練他，就是在家庭裏，在田野中，他們拿了竹頭木屑刀劍釘錘，隨便做，隨便毀，三經充分表現着有科學性的創造力；並且他們不擔在書籍　畫標本模型方面，到處有豐富的科學的意味，就是日常的玩具，眞是五花八門，爭奇鬥巧有許多東西，在落後的中國成年人看來，也許莫名其妙，而他們五六歲的孩子們，已經很是明自各種玩具的使用了，他們從小便這樣去訓練，再到學校　裏便可發揮他們科學的天才，到社會上也便有科學的創造了。</p>
<p>回頭一看我們中國，在普通家庭裏不必說，在學校裏也提不起科學的興趣，就是呆板的科學的讀物，也是貧乏到極點，在一年前有人把三十七家書店出版的目錄統計一下，兒童科學書祇有二百九十種，其中一百九十六種是屬於理論方面的，關於實用的書，可使兒童看了便會做的，祇有九十四種，最能啓發兒寬理智和興趣的工藝機械方面的書祗有九種，而此九種中，最合寬用祇有一種。在這可貴的統計數字中，便可知道中國對於兒童，自少不能養成他們的科學興趣和工作習慣，所有的敎育祇能使他們讀書考試，而不知其他：在讀書時候，也祇有被動的聽講，無自動的創作，在這樣的環境下面，即使把歐美各國的孩子敎餐起來，也要和科學絕緣的，所以中國科學不進展，不是中國民族的不好，而長沒有科學的訓練。</p>
<p>在兒童讀物方面，巳有少數人注意到了、可是和讀物佔有同樣重要的玩具，還沒有多少人理會，其實玩具是訓練兒童科學天才的基本工具，因爲模仿性與劍造性表現最豐富時期，是在童年時代，而實物的引人入勝，又遠過於書本，故提倡科學玩具，乃是提倡科學的首要工作，這是我們邊次舉辦科學玩具展覽會的唯一目的，也是我們科學化運動最大的使命。</p>
<p>我們微集各種含有科學化的玩具公開陳列，除了招待兒童們，以引起其對於科學玩具的興趣外，更有下列五種意義：</p>
<p>（一）家長們看了以後，知道玩具的重要，什麼是科學化的玩具，並借此可以作爲選購科學玩具的南針。</p>
<p>（二）師長們看了以後，知道書本以外，還有玩具，一樣是敎育兒童的軍要工具。</p>
<p>（三）工藝美術家看了以後，知道培養　族高尙的興趣，還應注意到後一代國民的重要工具，應當分出一部分力量來努力於此。</p>
<p>（四）科學家看了以後，知道要在試騐室中得到民好的成績，先應在家庭裏增養好科學天才，而改良玩具，亦是科學家應有的資任。</p>
<p>（五）製造玩具家看了以後，知道玩具有關國家民族，不是小玩意的商品，應當如何　精益求綺。</p>
<p>除此五種意義外，在本會自身，也有重大的目的，就是把徵集的許多玩具，請專家來總合批評，提出改進的意見，可使裂造者得到改良進展的機會。</p>
<p>最後要鄭重聲明的，就是這一次籌備時間和人手都是盛到不够，所以還不能照理想的表現出來。希望對於此事關心的人們，不客氣的予以指導和批評，可使以後第二次舉辦時，得以有所改進。</p>

<p>業餘漫談</p>
<h3>談奢侈</h3>
<p>— 范星</p>
<p>根據學理，奢侈起淤慾望。慾望是本能的，先天的，假使人類沒有慾望，就不想推進社會，社會再也不會有進步了。慾望不限於一種，有的是物質的慾望，就想消費，有的是精神的慾望，就想創造，發表。大凡文明社會中，文明或文化的程度愈高，慾望的需要也愈高，所以文明人類中的較高享受，往往是由慾望提高之後所產生出來的現象，這現象就使人類文明隨之增高。我們只希望人類普遍的一般的把生活享受提高起來，把一切以前認爲是奢侈的物品，都自然的變成大家的必需品。譬如以前一隻牙刷，雖然所費並不多，但在以前只是生活在水平綫以上的人能够使用，一般人都黃牙黑齒，，不用牙刷，但現在因文明程度的提高，漸漸有趨向普及之勢。可是現在還明明尙有不能使用牙刷的下層羣衆，如老農，如勞工，這，我只能說是人類的不幸，歷史的污點！假使將來每個家庭中都有一架收音機開開，那不是更好嗎？</p>
<p>假使說世界能够有一天犬家都過着奢侈的生話，我只覺得人類的向上，不覺得人類的墮落。但如果將多數人所應得的最低限度的需要，來完成一兩個人超特多數人的享受，則這種奢侈確實是人類的墮洛，證實了人類毀滅的必然。</p>
<p>孟特斯鳩說：如果富人不自由用錢，窮人就都要餓死了。這種話，似是而非。窮人不餓死，並不因爲富人肯用錢，窮人餓死，却也並不因爲富人肯用錢，倒是因爲富人拿了窮人的錢。所以，今日市塲的不景氣，購賣力的薄弱，並不是因爲大家把錢用窮了，實在是多數人沒有錢來化的綠故。因之，反對奢侈，實無充分的理由，而反需要大家都能够奢侈奢侈，才能眞正把市塲振與起來。這裏，就是一個能力問題，怎樣才能「能」，是一個問題。</p>
<p>我想，如大家可能的話，在物質上奢侈一點，不是壞事，只是「時間」上的奢侈，則實在要不得。某名人曾說：「中　是一個最奢侈的國家，」驟聽之，覺得這簡直是笑話，明明中國人大多生活在水平綫的最下層，怎樣說是最奢侈的國家呢？其實中國人的奢侈時間，確實是天下第一！梁啓超不說過嗎？提着鳥籠，啣着水姻筒，人家問他：你近來幹些什麽，回答的總是無聊消遺！你想，這樣的人民，這樣的國家，還不糟糕「意埋斯」，要待阿日？</p>

<h3>番族的漁獵生活</h3>
<p>— 宇</p>
<p>台灣通訉</p>
<p>台灣的番族，至今仍保存着一種特別的原始社會的氏族共同體。在那裏有兩個組織極爲完備的種族，卽塞脫族和索烏族。這種番族的社會組織，有所謂「番社」爲其基本形態。在前淸時代，台灣是淸朝的藩屬，當時曾經規定有一定的行政組織。自被日本奪去以來、又有一些變化。可是·這些外界所給予的制度不是自然發生的；現在不必叙述它。在這裏，我們所要介紹的，是關於番族社會生活和組織的自然形態所依以成立的漁獵生活。</p>
<p>塞脫族和索烏族的土地是氏族的共有物。氏族的各成員，在互不妨害他人的限度內，可以使用一部分公地。氏族各成員有如次之權利：（一）可以在公地內任意狩獵；（二）可以開墾山林原野；（三）開通道路，採伐竹木，可以採取各種天然產品作爲交換品；</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>（四）可以建築房屋居住。在番族中間，公地很多；農耕使地力用盡時，卽可休耕，將該地退還，歸公管理，而另領新地。</p>
<p>以上所述的公地制度是怎樣發生的？那是氏族的血綠關係形成的嗎？不是的！氏族各成員雖是共通地崇拜一個祖先人，而且舉行團體共祭：可是，那種習慣關係，不是經濟的所有制度之基礎。因爲經濟的所有制度，是關聯於勞動的生產過程——這是有下面的事實可證明的。</p>
<p>番旅狩獵的一般方法，有火獵，狩出，邀擊，追擊，壓殺，圈套，竹針，縛頸，陷穽等。這許多方法之中，火獵，狩出，縛頸是需要部落全體共同勞勁；邀擊和追擊需要三五個人一齊勞動；其他的，通常是一個人卽可成功的。從這裏我們可以看出一種重大意義的要點，就是，在多數塲合，不是一個人可以成功；共同狩獵是他們番人生活的主要內容。</p>
<p>番人有所謂「獵團」，是公共團體，是由親友及意志相投者臨時組織的。原始的獵團形態的殘留形骸，便是現今的公共獵團。每年照例在祭祀前後的狩獵，是由公共獵團舉行的。這種公共獵團不僅是從事狩獵工作，而且還負有軍事上的任務在活動。對於外來侵略的敵人，有時是全賴他去抵抗的。</p>
<p>塞脫族的獵塲，直到現在，還是全體成員所公有的。不管成員的姓氏，任何人都可任意在裏面狩獵。而且，獵團雖然是由一個「番社」的成員或一個部落的成員組織而成；但其組織不是番族所特有，那是從原始的氏族獵塲和獵團所演變而成的。</p>
<p>至於索烏族的獵塲，也是由各氏族所共有的。這裏不必重複叙述了。</p>
<p>狩獵所得的物品，在塞脫族是這樣規定的：最初追出野獸的獵犬，咬獸的獵犬及射獸的人，得首先取得野獸的一部份；所餘之肉，均分與獵團的各成員。</p>
<p>索烏族也有迄樣類似的習慣：在共同狩獵的塲合，是把獸肉之一部給與射殺者和逐獸的獵犬之主人；其餘則平分給各團員。據說，在北部索烏番族，對於同社的各家，雖然他們沒有去參加狩獵，也要獲得分配的東西。</p>
<p>另外有一個亞米斯族，當其其同狩獵的時侯，有如次的習慣。卽，首先第一次打擊野獸的人，可以取得該獸的頭顱，肋骨五根以內的肉及獸皮。第二次打擊野獸者，可得前腿一隻。暈初把獸捕獲者，可得後腿二隻；如果那野獸是雄性，還要把陰囊割給他。獵犬有特殊勳勞的時候、牠的主人卽分得特殊的物品。譬如，第一個發現野獸而追逐的犬，其主人可得後腿二隻；第一次咬傷野獸的獵犬，其功與第一次打擊者相等，其主人可得頭顱，肋骨肉及獸皮。以上的規則，是施行於獵獸當時的。在狩獵完畢而集合於一地時，以上所述的受賞者中，其取得前後腿者，卽將獸腿分爲二部，從膝關節割斷，將大的部分提供給獵團，其餘仍歸自己所得。至於脊肉及內　，則平分給同行之人；受賞者僅僅取得比較一般團員所得略小一點的肉。</p>
<p>由上述的實况，可知這樣的事情，卽所獲得的物品是完全明白地屬於獵團的共有物。有功勞的成員不過是受賞而已。由此，可得如次的兩個原則：第一，恊同勞動的所得物是「番社」中人人共有的：第二，對於爲共同生產而有功勞的成員，視其功勞的大小而給與相當的報酬。這兩個原則，恰與古代原始共同體的情形一樣，從實際生活上分析起來，是自然發生的。</p>
<p>除了狩獵團之外，還有所謂「撈魚團」的組織。這也是一種很自然的生活狀能）。</p>
<p>撈魚的方法很多。譬如鈎魚，籠魚，摸魚，都是一個人單獨可行的；只是這種個人所得的收獲很有限。主要的方法，還是這些方法：一種是用魚籘搾取液汁傾入河或海水中使魚麻醉後在水面上抬魚：另一種是把河塘的水徘乾或阻止溪溝的流水，然後在淺水或沙石上拾魚；再一種是張網或打網捕魚……這些方法，常需要很多的人共同工作。這種共同撈魚，是和共同狩獵一樣的有意義。共同撈魚的所得物、仍是依各成員所盡的勞力而適當均分的。</p>
<p>番民的狩獵和撈魚，不僅搆成番族原始社會的生活關係，而且，因爲狩獵和撈魚都富於集團的娛樂性，所以在番民「各取所得，各盡其能」的共同生活中，造成了極其親密而樸實的風氣。由於這種親密而樸實的優點，使番族的農業生活及土地公有制度，獲得極其必然的關係。</p>

<h3>相人之術</h3>
<p>— 錢鈞</p>
<p>每一個人都不能孤獨地生活，每一個人又都必定要生活於社會之中，所以認識自己的朋友乃至當代的時人，都是有十分必要的，因爲他們都能對自己的生活發生直接的影響。相人之術，不但對於個人很是重要，並且也是最難的一件事。中國數千年來，都曾以有無「知人之明」作爲評定個人賢愚的標凖，這不是沒有原因的。而許多賢哲聞人也往往有失於知人的地方，便可見這的確是一種很重要和很困難的學問。唐太宗要算歷史上最英明的君主，他却以錯用楊國忠高力士一流人物而把自己的天下鬧得糟透。以飽學知理的蘇老泉，亦不能認識王安石的才能，反作辨奸論以譏之，便是明證。</p>
<p>相人之術也有着許多的準備。在命相術士者流，他們是專從一個人的自然機體上去評斷一個人的命運善惡的，這一種的相人術，自然用不着去理會他。但在習慣上乃至歷史上，那種雖不基於命相術士的迷信方法去相人，却仍同樣單從個人的自然機體上去判斷個人的，亦頗不乏其例。此如以貌取人而失之子羽的孔老先生就是一個著名的實例。人的意識行爲都是社會的產物，絕少和　人的自然機體有關係，是很明白的，所以這種相人術的毫無用處，幾乎可以不言而喻。</p>
<p>其次是根據個人的意識行爲去判斷那一個人的方法。這種相人術雖然不能說在任何情形下都是絕對錯誤的，但一般的習慣是把那被判斷的個人，和他的社會相隔離起來去審判他，是限於從他的意識行爲本身去判斷他個人。所以在一般人評論他的朋友和當代的時人時，總只能聽到他們說些這個人思想如何，行爲如何，他的思想行爲在批判者的評價上是怎樣正確和錯誤，而不大聽到他們追述到社會和環境怎樣决定他走生這種思想和行爲的話。像這樣的相人方法，我們也可以斷定它是完全錯誤的。因爲人的思想行爲旣都是社會的產品，他的思想行爲必定要代表與他相應的社會金圖，如果你在觀察他時只看他個人和其意識行動，而不深究到發出他那種思想行爲的根源，無論如何你也不會懂得他的思想行爲之所以然。一個人的思想行爲，如果刮除了牠的社會意義，那牠就都只簡單地成爲生理的自然機能的單調活動，成爲生物的一般的物質機能的表現，在這種活動的本質上，在他的個人的獨立單位上，都無所謂善惡。狗對主人搖尾歡迎沒有甚麼善行的意義，而牠咬傷客人也沒有甚麽罪惡的意義，其理由就在於動物的單純的自然機能之感情和行爲的爆發，是沒有社會的意義的，我們不能判別其爲善爲惡。如果我們觀察人的行爲思想只限於以他個人爲單位，從他的思想行爲本身去批判他，那就等於對狗的搖尾咬人强加它一種善惡的估價，是一樣的多餘和無聊。不但如此，個人的思想行爲是變換的，因此自己前後常相矛盾，拿坡崙曾革過法國皇室的命，然而拿坡崙自己也當過皇帝。如果你單從拿坡崙個人本位去觀察他，那就莫明其妙。倡使你從法國的社會　化，從和他相應的社會變化與他個人的地位變化上去判斷他，那你就能知道他的思想行爲並不自相矛盾，而這矛盾是法國社會的矛盾，是法國社會擔化中所產出的矛盾。更進一層說，在一定社會要求之實現的過程中，往往那最高目的是隱匿在浮表的外觀之裏面的，外觀上的迂迥曲折不過是達到目的的手叚而已。這正等於我們航海的最後目的是東京，如果遇有海盜或暗礁橫亘在我們的航綫中途，那我們就把船撥向左灣右拐，但這只是臨時的策略，目的還是不變地存在的。因爲如此，所以每一個人的臨時的思想，言論，行爲之外面的表現，往往和其內心不相一致，甚至有時是有意識地要以此爲掩飾其眞面目，使人不至疑惑他的一種必要手叚。做賊人也呌賊，就是這個道理。所以我們觀察個人，若只注意其言行思想之臨時的外表，不從他的社會背景，生活基礎去找出他的過去未來的必然過程，我們便不能認識這個人。如此則我們也就只有把口蜜腹劍的　甫當作好人，把與世常件的斯賓諾莎當作瘋子。總之，如果我們相人只從他的個人，他的意識本身去判斷他，則我們必不能認識這個人，而且將反爲他的冠冕堂皇的外表言行所迷惑，會把他對你所作的最有害的事當作最好的事，在你被他殺了的時候也還不知道是他殺的。當然，更不必說想預見到這個人的行徑之必然趨向，以此去準確地判斷他以後的究竟了。</p>
<p>因爲這樣，所以我們如果企國對於我們的朋友和時人都能加以正確的判斷和認識，那麽，在相人術的講求上就必須要採取科學的方法去解剖每一個人。這方法，就原則上說，是以社會科學的知識爲基礎，卽從整個社會的發展的歷史的作用上，從被觀察者的社會基礎和環境上，從現實的社會事變上去觀察社會的變化，在那裏去找每一個人的意識行爲的根源，與這些意識行爲臨時變化的原因。這樣，便不管被觀察者的言行怎樣變化百出，我們都可以認識他，都可以斷定他的過去未來，也可以不至爲他的外表的粉飾和做作所迷惑了。舉例來說，比如我們觀察胡適博士的有限的維新的生命，是得從他的受美國敎育，從他的博士地位，敎授地位，乃至他所</p>

<h3>男女同學問題</h3>
<p>— 李俊文</p>
<p>在一星期以前的報紙上，刋載着北平市政府下令嚴厲取締私立中等學校男女同學，以維風化的消息。這雖是僅限於北平一地的一種敎育行政上的變更，但在我們看來，這種失當的，不，簡直是荒謬的措置，牠的影響所及，不僅使北平一地的敎育界蒙到不良的名譽，而且使整個的中國敎育界同樣留下了一個開倒車的大　點。</p>
<p>男女同學，本是美國爲便於敎學而創設的一種制度，嗣後經一般學者認爲迅種制度確乎具有多種的優點，於是遂爲各國的敎育界所採用。至於這種制度之於中國，尤爲重要，那更是任何人所不能否認的事實。男女同學，主要的約有四個優點。一·可以節省敎育經費。興辦敎育最感到困難的便是經費問題，傻如男女不能同學，那末，要使一地的人　　　　　　　，　　　　　　踴　　　　　　　而在這敎育程度低落，敎育經費支絀的我國，是否能允許我們這樣辦呢？但若男女同學，就可以避免這種困難。二，减少兩性間的不道德行爲。我國向來是男女分開的，在這種隔離的情形之下，對於異性往往會引起一種異乎尋常的興味，甚至做出有傷風化的事情來。男女同學在起初或許也有些異樣，但是經過了相當的時間後，因彼此間已習爲常態，便不足爲奇了。三，養成女子的獨立心。中國女子未受敎育者固然不必去說他，卽使受過敎育的女子，也往往存着女子是永久附屬於男子的觀念，以爲男子的能力總是比女子强。其實這是極大的錯誤。要打破這種觀念，多受敎育固然需要；然而，若能男女同學，那競更可以使她們眞實的明瞭男子並不怎樣的了不得，女子未必一定遜色於男子。四，鞏固自由結婚的甚礎？在目前雖有不少的男女，大家在盲目的呌　着，　行　　　　　，可是結婚後的結果　　　　了　　　　　，　　　　　　　　　女靑年够不上自由結婚，而是因爲他們間的認識還沒有十分的眞切，也就是因爲社交公開還沒有抵於成熟，於是就有不少靑年做了這時代的犧牲者。欲補救這種缺陷，自非有賴於男女同學不可。</p>
<p>不過，在少年時代，正是情慾旺最盛的時期，所謂「有傷風化」的事情，自然也難保沒有，誠然，就是這一點，也已足以造成名流們取締的口實了，但我們却祇覺得當局的這種舉動，未免有些近於因噎廢食，同時，我們假如從反面着想、卽使把男女分開了，是否就不會有有傷風化的事情發生呢？</p>
<p>就是素來守舊的土耳其婦女現在也在飛躍的進步着，從前土耳其沒有男女同學，現在也有了，而我們中國却在這新文化的策源地——北平，有這種極不合理而足爲外人訕笑的事情發生；難道讀經救國的倒車開得不够，還要來一個男女授受不親，把女子　回家庭　不成？</p>

<p>屬社會等等去看他的、只要能把這些過去歷史與社會的狀態弄淸楚，我們就能判斷和認識他。我們觀察廿地和其不抵抗主義，只要能懂得印度社會之宗敎的歷史作用，懂得印度的工商業者對於英國的統治想反抗而又不敢反抗的社會情形，亦卽可以明白甘地的爲人和其思想　便是以些例子。是的，相人　有　的，但不是相命的術士的相人法可以使我們認淸一個人，而是要以社會科學的方法作爲我們日常的相人法。知人在每個個人都有必要，因爲我們以外的個人，其思想　爲都能直接影響到自己的生活。大家都來學點科學的相人法罷。</p>

<h3>我怎樣學世界語？</h3>
<p>— 基</p>
<p>從賬桌上領了八塊錢——一個月的薪水，我充滿了歡喜與疑惑的心搭上到卡德路的電車（半年來爲了求一點知識，給一般野鷄補習學校（自然也有辦理完善的）騙去的汗血錢已很可觀了，然而「知識」一點也沒有進步。「這一會應該愼重些了，」在電車上我自己對自己說着</p>
<p>下了車，按址找到了藏在弄堂深處的上海世界語者恊會，推進門去向職員要了一份章程，坐着細細的看。當時就有一位「世界語者服務團」的團員跑過來對我解釋幾個疑點，例如國際共通語的可能性咧。從理想主義的世界語到現實主義的世界語咧……他的誠懇而且富於煽動力的言辭堅固了我的學世界語的决心。當時就不再躊躇的拿出三塊錢繳了講習班學費並買了一本敎科書回家去約約的看了一個黃昏。</p>
<p>自從這一天起，我便開始做一姻世界語者了。我們這一期講習班的敎師姓　，是一位溫和熱誠和永不疲倦的中年人，課外導師姓D，也是一位非常謙虛和有聞必答的先生，靠了他們的活潑指導，我們這一班的同學大家都在短短的三個月裏學畢了世界語的基礎。在學習過程裏，我有一次因爲幾處文法上的困難而想把研究中輟，但幸賴敎師先生和其他老同志們用茶訢會，壁報等等方式不斷的鼓舞我們的興趣，我終於克服了困難，繼續讀下去。在這三個月的苦鬥中，我不但學會了一種新的語言，同時自已覺得思想方面也有了很大的進步，因爲世界語是全世界被壓迫民族彼此互相聯絡團結的最好工具。</p>
<p>現在，我靠了宇典的帮助，已能自由閱讀書報了。已經讀過的書有屠格湼夫的「父與子」，尤利巴基的「萬歲」，高爾基的「我怎樣讀書」，布格達諾夫的「紅星球」，正在讀的是格拉特可夫的「怒吼吧中國」，並且還定了四份雜誌·蘇聯的「在哨崗」，日本的「前進」，匈牙利的「文學世界」，美國的「科學雜誌」。至於應用世界語方面我也開始和國外同志通信，收到的信已有六十多封，其中包含十七個國家，二十幾種職業，從通信上我知道了許多向來所不知道的東西。</p>
<p>事實上，世界語使我拋棄了過去的陳舊思想，開始認識這個世界。對於我，世界語雖然只學了不到一年，但是它給我的帮助和啟示，比較過去在學校裏所學習到的全部更要豐富得多。</p>

<h3>腦袋的地位</h3>
<p>— 韓琦</p>
<p>人的腦袋不是很顯明地居方全身之上的嗎？然而這裏却提出『腦袋的地位』問題來討論，乍看起來似乎是很奇怪，其實一點也不奇怪。就人的自然的理組織說，不錯，腦袋是居於全身之首的，但若就腦袋的作用說，那能够正確地估量牠的地位的人就非常的少了。</p>
<p>宗敎家說人是上帝的兒子，是神生的。他把人與動物界劃分開來，把人和自然界隔絕起來。這就是說，他不但把腦袋高抬在自然物以上，並且把人也高抬在自然界以上去了。直至文藝復興以後，特別是生物進化論出世以後，人們纔知道了人亦由動物進化而來，那久已離開自然界的人，從那時起，是仍然回到他的原來的地位上去了，仍然成爲自然界物類之一，歸於動物的行列中去了。可是，在許多哲學家看來，人類的思維是特殊的靈物，它有不受自然進化變遷的法則所支配的原理，道德律，理性等等。這些東西，在他們看來，在宇宙中是先天的，甚至在一切萬物存在之前就有了它們。然而，思維明明是出於腦子的作用，思維旣然可以脫離人的自然的有機體而存在於另一世界，那麼腦子是不能存在在人的自然機體的身體上，這是當然的邏輯。腦子不居於自然界，牠是居於另一世界的東西。不但如此，照許多哲學家說來，要有主觀的思維才有天地日月等自然物，沒有思維它們就都不存在了，所以思維是至上的。思維旣然出於腦子，那麼腦子更是至上的，沒有腦子也就沒有一切。這樣，人的腦袋這東西，其地位不但居於人身之首，而且牠的至上的地位是過分崇高的，高出於世界萬有之上了。牠是唯一的首先存在的東西，不是自然物質的進化創造腦子，而是腦子創造世界的一切。根據上面的說法，那麽我們正確地來估量一下腦子的地位，不是很有必要的嗎？</p>
<p>照世界進化的程序來說，原子電子我們雖不知道它是甚麼時候存在的，但至少可以斷定我們的太陽系存在以前，還有別的太陽系存在過；我們的太陽存在了好多萬萬年以後才有了地球。地球存在了好多萬萬年以後才有生物，單細胞生物存在以後，更經過幾千萬年的進化，然後才由下等動物到高等動物，再產生出人類。人類在開始時雖已有居於全身之上的腦子，但那時的腦子和動物的腦子大槪還是相差不遠的。就是說思維能力還很不發達。思維在腦子裏逐漸發達起來，這是幾千年的社會生活逐漸進步的結果。如此，則腦子這東西雖在人的自然機體上居於首位，但牠也是自然物的進化把牠產生出來的。至於思維，不但是腦子的產物，而且還是社會的產物、。思維不能高抬在自然世界以上，不能先於自然物質而存在，腦子也不能高抬其地位於自然物之上，不能先於自然物質而存在。不特如此，思維和人的腦子，還不能抬高到社會以外，先社會而存在。如果離開了社會，則人的思維和人的腦子便都會沒有的，所有的只是動物的生命力和動物的腦子罷了。照這樣說來，腦子的地位雖在人身之首，但牠只能在自然界之中與別的自然物佔一同等的地位，佔一同等的時空，不能高出於世界一切的。</p>
<p>不錯，人類腦子所產生出來的思維是偉大的，它能認識和思想一切，能指導人的行動，根據這行動去創造社介的全般生活，也改造自然界。但是，無論對於自然的認識，對於社會的認識，都不能一次構成永久不變的完美的圖式和知識。這就是說它仍有缺陷須得隨時來改正和補充，科學的進步正是在指明這點。因爲如此，所以說人的思維在一定的時空中就是至上的，這話是完全不對的。因爲它所包含的因素，其需要改進的地方，從無限的進程一點上來說，遠較其不需要改進的部分多得多。自然，人類運用其腦子以思維，是無限向前發展的，因此人類思維在這種觀點上說，仍是至上的。然而，卽使如此，我們也須知道，社會的思維乃是過去，現在與將來的若干萬萬人的思維之綜合的成果，而不是個人的成效。並且這種綜合的成效仍屬有限，要限於在人類自身能够充分長期存在的範圍以內才有可能，是很明白的。</p>
<p>這樣看來，人類的腦袋是隨其所發生的思維之作用而成爲至上的，同時又是非至上的。因爲在一般的世界進化上，思維是腦子的產物，而腦子自身則又是自然的產物。牠能認識自然，改造世界，但它只能依照自然法則和社會法則去改造世界，此種改進還要限於在人類自身之延續上才有可能，並且也只有在這延續的進步中有其無限的進程，表現其至上性。人類的腦袋在人之自然機體上是居於首位，在字宙的進化上，牠仍然只能被還原於原來的人的動物的機體的位置上，還原於自然物的地位。牠不是先於一切而存在的東西，也沒有高出於一切之至上的神聖的地位。腦袋是人和自然的所有物，牠並不能獨立地站在世界之外盡其指導世界的地位。自然的進化倒要來產生改造牠，自然倒是給牠以資料，法則命令牠思維和工作的主人</p>

<h3>介紹「社會評論」</h3>
<p>— 方容</p>
<p>—福州路二九〇號發行，定價每期四分—</p>
<p>社會評論，是一個小小的半月刊。它是完全用美麗的仿古字印成的；在每篇文字的標題上面，都挿有新奇美妙的圖畫；無論誰看了之後，都要很自然地稱贊它印刷精良，外觀美好。的確，我們看這小刊物時，單是它的外觀給我們的印象也很暢快，不像那些亂七八糟地用濫字釘印成的刊物那麽令人討厭。至於內容，我可以說是與它的名字「社會評論」完全相合的。凡是現實社會所發生的一切與我們有密切關係的社會現象，這小刋物都能及時地把握着，給以正確的評判。最近社會上所發生的自殺殺人的問題，失業和犯罪的問題，與夫那些敬神信鬼的光怪陸離的社會現象，在「社會評論」中，我們都可看到精確的說明。同時，這個小刋物還闢有「時事解說」，「生活素描」，「國內外通訊」，「不幽默小品」，「通俗學術講座」等欄，其中文字都是活潑有意義的：就是「不幽默小品」，也和那些流行的只想博取貴婦人的微笑的幽默文章不一樣，它是不僅有「笑料」，而且還是有深刻的社會意義的，如「三纏救世論」（第一期），如「鬼世界的進化」（第二期）……等文，是與林語堂派的幽默文章在本質上全不相同的。此外，在「社會評論」的尾後，還有「半月社會」一欄，這中間所載的，都是半月間社會上所發生的矛盾而又可笑可泣的事情，看起來，不僅使人威到有讀「論語」似的「輕鬆」，而且還可使人在這「輕鬆」中正確地認識出目前的社會究竟是怎樣的一個社會。</p>
<p>「社會評論」這個小刊物的文字都很淺顯有趣，讀起來毫不費力，牠的確是一般中小職員，失業失學的靑年朋友以及中學生們的良好讀物。所以，我特地在指導一般職業人員生活的「業餘週刋」上寫一個簡單的介紹，將這小刋物貢獻給它的讀者們。同時，據說這小刋物的作者都是文壇上的「名人」的化名：爲了一般讀者，爲了中國社會，我們希望這刋物的作者更加努力，使這刋物日益充實起來。若依我們的「奢望「社會評論」能改爲周刋更好，因爲像現在這樣的半月刋還不能使人滿足。這個「奢望」，不知道「社會評論」的先生們能於最近辦到否？</p>

<h3>純情詩人雪萊（四）</h3>
<p>— 日本鶴見祐輔作周樂山戚俊夫譯</p>
<p>五</p>
<p>回到倫敦時的雪萊，照例是囊空如洗。他一生困於金錢，但未曾餓死，這是件奇怪的事。他終生之所以貧乏，是因爲他對於金錢很不關心的緣故。</p>
<p>盛怒之下，他父親和海麗的父親說，分文不給這對年靑的夫婦。然而最後，照例的又是他舅父的討情，他父親才允許照舊的每年給他二子元。每麗的父親也年給她二千元。他們才得從餓死綫上逃出。</p>
<p>這時的他，作了許多非常識的不可思議的事情。他的思想越發越發的革命化。當時和拿破崙戰爭的英國，以鐵般的壓力　壓國內的自由思想。因此雪萊把他自己所寫的革命論文，裝在小木箱裏乏之於海，或者乘風船在大空中散揚，或者裝於啤酒空瓶中，流之於川。他患用這種方法使拾着的人門　。他生怕自己的書陳列在牛津大學的書店的店頭，使書店主人受累·所以用這種不牽累他人的方法，企圖傳播自己的思想於社會。他的愛他的精神和所採取的實行這精神的孩子般的手段，令人禁不住微笑。這便是他的一生。</p>
<p>他是某人評淪他所說的「誤從天之一角墜下來的大空的情」以的明朗的純情的人，是沒有毒心惡意，一塵不染的人。以少年似的天眞爛漫處世，這在世間說起來便是所謂非常識。這種純情和非常識也便是這位Apollo神似的秀美的天才兒的淚的一生之因。</p>
<p>他像隻迷入狠羣的羊。</p>
<p>六</p>
<p>這時候，他和他少年以來所愛讀的政治的正義的著者哥特文交際。哲人哥特文過着和他所發表的哲學簡直是相反的生活。但私淑崇拜他的雪萊並未留意到這些。他以自己的純情和正直，把普天之下的人都當做善人看待。</p>
<p>哥特文的家裏有三個異父異母的女兒和二個兒子。這些娘兒們對雪萊起了很大的騷動。她們的鄰家是一家呌着牛頓的。那家的夫人和姑娘們也特別喜歡雪萊。雪萊的行之所至，都受孩子們的歡迎。</p>
<p>映在女性們的眼裏的，不單是雪萊的美貌和天才，而且還有他那玉般的性質。但他是無我的，寬大的，無慾的這點，她們却不曾觀察到。哥特文的姑娘們呌他是「淘氣鬼」，「精王」；牛頓家的姑娘呌他是「空精」和「物精王」。</p>
<p>他什麼時候來訪是不知道的。來的時候便像大風一樣的吹進來。於是便興致淋漓，滔滔不絕的講起故事。但正說着故事，忽然又開始講說他的哲學論，痛論理想的社會。這樣在不知不覺之中，東方已經晨曦微露，他伴着姑娘們到街上去散步。</p>
<p>婚後的一二年，「酒店娘」的本性在海麗的身上現出來了。她的愛聽雪萊的詩論哲理，不過是一種努力而已，她本性所愛好的是美麗的衣裳和繁華的社交。乘着徹宵語詩的丈夫不在，便和許多惡男友們出去遊要。（未完）</p>

<h3>「民族魂」中難民多</h3>
<p>Allstarcast的作品「女兒經」受到了廣大的觀衆的歡迎，明星公司為子適合社會人士的需要，又攝製了這部以反帝為題才，全體　演明星合作的「民族魂」。這其中還穿插了一段，以徐錫麟刺恩銘的推翻滿淸的民族革命的史實，希望能　起了民衆皮帝的情緒，收復東北的失地。</p>
<p>日前該片攝製難民收容所一塲，數百名臨時演員，擠滿了整個的露天攝影塲，把廣大的難民的苦痛在鏡頭前面表現出來，高占非襲稼農鄭小秋等，他們都捨棄了家，熱情地勇敢地領導着廣大的難民，走上了反帝的戰綫。這一塲戲的導演者是程步高。</p>
<h3>顧夢鶴演技總結算</h3>
<p>一個成功的演員不能只有一方面的演技，可是要在一部戲　裏面能有盡量發展其多方面的演技的機會也很難。最近顧夢鶴却得到了這麼一個機會。他出現在「秋扇明燈」之中開頭是學生，後來變成浪子，結果做囚犯，而且流為癟三。這幾層階段無疑地是包涵着正派與反派的作風，軟性和硬性的表演，是一方面的演技的總結算，多說也可算是一部演技大全哩。</p>
<h3>藝華花絮</h3>
<p>應雲衛所編之「時代英雄」複審劇本已通過。</p>
<p>外傳唐納將任某公司新片之主角，實屬不確。</p>
<p>袁叢美自導演「暴風雨」以來，體重已减少五磅半。</p>
<p>好萊塢有梅蕙絲脫，中國則有葉娟娟，葉娟娟在「人之初」中之「熱」的表情，就與梅蕙絲脫在「儂本多情」中之作風相同。</p>
<p>鄭應時已放棄「苦兒流浪記」劇本，另編成一新劇本，並已送京檢查。</p>
<p>藝華露天攝影塲中，近搭成昔日之閘北街道商店佈景，除人工外，單材料費已費去四千餘元，係備「人之初」戲中應用，聞此佈景將來不拆去，而用火　之，使化成灰燼，蓋其中亦有一段因果也。</p>
<p>小明星陳娟娟在「人之初」中有極好的演技。</p>
<p>素有酒仙之稱的吳六言，在袁叢美的「暴風雨」中飾一酒鬼。</p>
<p>魏鶴齡近患背痛，但仍「力疾拍戲」。</p>
<p>章志直在「暴風雨」中客串一工頭角色</p>
<p>關胖子在「人之初」中大吃耳光，計吃二打之多，最妙的是他喊那個打他耳光的女人，要用力的打。因用力的打，他的表情才可做得深刻，結果，關胖子的兩頰紅腫了三天。</p>
<p>卜萬蒼已銷假，「凱歌」繼續工作。</p>
<p>「時代英雄」俟「人之初」全部完竣後，卽上塲（攝影塲）工作，主角在嚴密遴選中。</p>
<h3>李阿毛開糧食行</h3>
<p>新夜報李阿毛信箱的主答徐卓呆，最近又在藝華公司攝製中，　萬蒼導演的有聲片「凱歌」中客串一相當滑稽角色，他所說的對白，就與在李阿毛信箱回答問者的話，有着同樣的幽默，俏皮的風味。</p>
<p>現在的徐卓呆，是新聞界中的人物，要知道幾年前的徐卓呆，却是在話劇界中，很負聲名的，個呢，所以，他能够以過去在話劇界所得到的經騐，而現身銀幕。</p>
<p>在「人間仙子」中他是飾一個代表現社會專事追求女人的富有者，「新婚的前夜」中是飾一個男性拜金主義者。現在「凱歌」中是一個鄉間糧食行的老闆了。</p>

<h3>Complete Resolution of the Sino-French-Vietnamese Issue: Schedules A and B Signed Yesterday, Other Annexes Exchanged Simultaneously</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Sino-French-Vietnamese and Chinese Border Province Relations Treaty was negotiated and signed on May 16, 1930, by the former Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Zhengting and the former French Ambassador to China, Madé. However, due to the failure to agree on Schedules A and B within the first annex, the procedures were incomplete and the treaty could not be implemented. After five years of repeated negotiations, Schedules A and B were finally agreed upon completely. Other related annexes were also negotiated and completed simultaneously. At 4 PM in April, Acting Foreign Minister Wang and French Ambassador Wilden formally signed the protocol on the establishment of Schedules A and B at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and simultaneously exchanged other related documents, thus completely resolving the case. (Central News Agency dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Sino-French-Vietnamese and Chinese Border Province Relations Treaty, signed by China and France on May 16, 1930, had been stalled for several years due to unresolved implementation methods. In recent months, French Ambassador Wilden negotiated with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and reached an agreement. After being approved by the Central Political Council yesterday, the full text of the agreement was signed at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 4:30 PM today by Acting Foreign Minister Wang and French Ambassador Wilden. The agreement stipulates the methods for trade between China and Vietnam and resolves various difficulties in the implementation of the 1930 Sino-French Treaty, which is beneficial to both China and France. The agreement includes a protocol, a detailed list of Chinese goods permitted to enjoy the lowest import tax rates in Vietnam, and a detailed list of Chinese and Vietnamese goods permitted to be imported into China at the current tax rates. In addition, it includes an exchange of letters between the Chinese and French governments to resolve certain economic issues. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>

<h3>British Attitude Towards Germany After German Expansion of Armaments</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>When Germany declared the establishment of an air force and implemented compulsory military service, French public opinion immediately stated, "The close cooperation between Britain and France achieved through the recent London Agreement has now been destroyed. Paris is now swaying between two poles: Moscow and London. If British-French cooperation cannot be realized, then Franco-Russian cooperation will naturally follow." This view is quite close to reality. Because Britain and France have the London Agreement, the relationship between France and Russia is distant while the relationship between Britain and France is close. The reason France spared no effort to conclude a sky security pact with Britain, willing to use the French air force to protect British security, was to hope that Britain would support France's position and jointly deal with Germany. However, British diplomats offer lip service but do not deliver in practice, still hesitating between the two, without taking sides. There are objective and subjective reasons why Britain has to do this. However, France cannot avoid disappointment in Britain because of this. Examining Britain's traditional policy, as British Major-General Fuller said: (1) Establish domestic peace on the basis of democratic politics. (2) Maintain the balance of power internationally. (3) Build secure borders. (4) Maintain maritime hegemony. (5) Autonomous colonies with self-defense capabilities are allowed to govern themselves. Although Britain is a pioneer in world democratic politics, after the world economic panic struck Britain, a cabinet of national unity emerged. Party politics has become crippled. The purpose of the national unity cabinet was to concentrate power to cope with the adverse domestic economic situation. However, it has been three years since its establishment, and economic recovery is still difficult to achieve. As for the autonomous territories that are too big to fail, such as Australia and Canada, they have their individual interests in economics, their individual positions in politics, and their individual policies in diplomacy. Their steps cannot be completely consistent with the mother country. In addition, Ireland's independence movement has not yet been pacified. In India, its autonomous movement has suddenly made great strides. All of these are enough to make British politicians uneasy. Therefore, in terms of the domestic situation in Britain, Britain has no time to care for other things, nor is it willing to care for other things. Furthermore, in terms of Britain's foreign policy, Britain's maintenance of the balance of power in Europe and its own naval superiority are facts well known to the world. Since the 16th century, when Britain defeated the Spanish Armada, its continental policy has always supported one while suppressing the other. For example, helping Prussia against France in the 19th century and helping France against Germany in the early 20th century are the most obvious examples. After the end of the Great War, France monopolized Europe, which was not liked by Britain. Britain then implemented its traditional policy of secretly suppressing France and promoting Germany. Germany initially demanded the lifting of the restrictions on German reparations. Britain then mediated, and the Lausanne Agreement was concluded. Germany finally got its wish. Germany then demanded equality in armaments. Britain then echoed, saying that Germany should have the right to equality in armaments. When the London Agreement was concluded, Germany also finally got its wish. These two were indeed beneficial to Germany, but very unfavorable to France. Therefore, for the sake of its own security and to prevent German revenge, France had to seek like-minded allies. This is why the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Agreement, after several twists and turns, was finally established recently.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Agreement was nominally based on the covenant, but according to Article 3 of the Mutual Assistance Agreement: "If a signatory country suffers aggression without provocation, it shall implement mutual assistance in accordance with Article 16 of the Covenant of the League of Nations (i.e., implement financial, economic, and military sanctions against the aggressor) and Article 17, Paragraph 3 (the provisions of Article 16 may also be implemented against non-member states)." In practice, it is a treaty that contains the nature of a military alliance. The establishment of this Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Agreement was directly facilitated by Germany, and indirectly facilitated by Britain. If Britain's attitude were not so uncertain, France's attitude might not be so firm, and the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Pact might not have been concluded so quickly. Now that the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Agreement has been completed, it remains to be seen whether Britain will still adhere to its policy of splendid isolation. After Germany reorganizes its air and land forces, it will reorganize its navy. It is inevitable that it will build twelve submarines. The politicians of Great Britain can still try to calm themselves after Germany reorganizes its army, but it can be asserted that they will oppose its reorganization of the navy.</p>
<p>Carefully examining the current European situation, British diplomacy is nothing more than two paths: (1) Cooperate with France, as before 1914. The German navy wanted to overwhelm Britain, and thus had a tacit understanding with France to jointly deal with Germany. (2) That is, continue to hold negotiations with Germany, with the greatest tolerance and the most generous conditions, to satisfy Germany's wishes and make it join the banner of collective security advocated by Britain. Now, judging from the speech given by the British Foreign Secretary in Parliament the other day (May 3), in which he strenuously advocated compromise with Germany to maintain European peace, the policy of British diplomacy is still trending towards the latter without change. It is just unknown whether Germany will be able to comply with the wishes of Great Britain in the future. We still remember that on the eve of the Great War in 1914, British Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey still wrote to the then-Ambassador to Germany, Sir Edward Goschen, instructing him to mediate with the German authorities. However, before long, Austria declared war. Germany mobilized. Russia mobilized. France responded. Britain finally became involved in the vortex of war. Now, Britain's domestic difficulties are the same as before the war. Britain's unwillingness to face war is also the same as before. What is unknowable is what Germany's future actions will be. Therefore, the saying that "the opportunity for war rests with Germany" is admittedly an exaggeration, but it does contain considerable truth.</p>
<h3>Judicial Yuan Interpretation: Doubts about the Application of Criminal Procedure</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the legal department of the Shanghai Concession Public Works Department's request for interpretation, regarding doubts about the application of the law for punishing sending threatening letters, the Judicial Yuan interpreted, "The 'Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits and Robbers' mean that if a threatening letter is sent to defraud property, it must be that the matters threatened meet the bandit behavior recognized by the regulations, and that the result causes damage to others. Otherwise, it belongs to the attempted or completed crime under Article 350 of the Criminal Law, or constitutes other crimes. If the threatened person puts silver coins into the package according to the threatening letter, and the defendant takes the package away, it is considered a loss, which is irrelevant to whether the stolen goods are recovered later, and the law of Article 370 of the Criminal Law is based on Article 320 of the Criminal Procedure Law to judge whether it is completed, and it can be changed for the behavior that has already been prosecuted." [This] instruction was forwarded to be known. (4th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Judicial Yuan recently interpreted the application of simple procedures in Book VII of the Criminal Procedure Law as follows: According to Article 42 of the Revised Provisional Regulations for County Magistrates Handling Lawsuits, county governments concurrently handling judicial affairs may apply it mutatis mutandis, and may omit the procedure of the prosecutor's application in accordance with Article 10 of the same regulations.

<h3>Guangxi Requests Reduction of Cattle Export Tax: Finance Minister Replies That It Is Inappropriate to Approve</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Guangxi Chairman Huang Xuchu telegraphed a request to reduce the cattle export tax rate. Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi replied that the cattle export tax is 7.5% of the value, which is no heavier than the previous old tax rate of 5% of the value and 2.5% surtax. Although cattle exports from our country have decreased in recent years, the quantity is still more or less the same as those exported before the 20th year, which is enough to prove that the reason for the decrease is not related to the tax rate. According to the records of Hong Kong trade, most of the imported cattle are transported from South China, and very few are imported from various parts of Southeast Asia. According to research, although the number of cattle imported from Annam has increased slightly in recent years, the number is far less than that transported from South China in the past. Last year, Hong Kong's cattle imports decreased by more than 2,000, and the degree of reduction from Annam was greater than that from South China, which proves that although there are cattle transported to Hong Kong for sale from various parts of Southeast Asia, the impact on domestic exports is still light. Farmers mostly raise cattle for cultivation, which is different in nature from domestic animals for heaven's use. In recent years, the countryside has declined, and farmers often sell plowing cattle to relieve urgent needs. The government has ordered the protection of plowing cattle, prohibiting slaughter, maintaining agricultural affairs, and preventing excessive sales of plowing cattle. Therefore, it is not appropriate to reduce the cattle export tax rate, and a special telegram is sent to reply. (4th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Orders All Agencies to Substantially Reduce Budget Numbers</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan decided at a temporary meeting on the 24th of last month that the expenses under the management of various ministries and commissions in the budget should be substantially reduced by the various ministries and commissions, with specific methods and general items. Those involving two or more agencies should be resolved at separate meetings. Orders have already been issued to comply with this. Now, because the Budget Planning Committee of the Central Political Conference has scheduled a meeting for the 7th, a special order has been issued to all subordinate agencies to send the reduction methods and numbers of all expenses under their management to the Secretariat of the Central Political Conference for verification before the 6th, and to report to the Yuan for handling.

<h3>Agreed to Accept Bills of Exchange: Request to Exempt from Stamp Duty Not Approved</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Shanghai Silk Industry Association and others advocated the issuance of commercial acceptance bills of exchange and petitioned the Ministry of Finance for approval to exempt them from stamp duty. The Ministry replied that these bills of exchange are a type of bill of exchange, and since the Provisional Regulations on Stamp Duty stipulate that bills of exchange should be affixed with stamps, it is not appropriate to follow the example of checks and postpone the affixing of stamps. The request should not be approved. (4th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Manila Gradually Returns to Calm: Philippine Rebels Disintegrate: Police Patrol All Streets and Markets All Night: Several Ring Leaders Have Been Arrested</h3>
<p>Manila: The Philippine rebellion in Manila has gradually calmed down tonight. Personnel from the Police Intelligence Bureau declared that this riot was unprecedented in the island's history. It is said that the rebels planned to rob Chinese and Japanese shops, the military storage bureau, destroy public buildings, and occupy government treasuries. The Philippine newspaper "News" reported that the radical party leader Ramos was the instigator of the rebellion. Yesterday, 56 people died and more than 50 were injured in the rebellion. It is rumored that Japanese people were agitating behind the scenes. Many rebel leaders and their subordinates have been arrested. The government has been able to control the overall situation. The rebels have now disintegrated due to the large number of deaths and the capture of their leaders. The army is now preparing to deal with any new incidents. News from the United States is increasing the calm of the situation. Philippine Senate President Quezon told the New York press that most Filipinos do not sympathize with this rebellion and do not agree with the radical party leader's request for immediate independence. Quezon does not believe in the claim that the Japanese were plotting behind the scenes. (4th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Manila: The situation in Manila and neighboring provinces, after a day and night of rebellious panic, was still tense last night. However, judging from the phenomenon, the chaos seems to be gradually subsiding. Cavite and San Ildefonso were the most violent places for the riots. More than 200 people have now been accused of treason. Last night, the police patrolled the streets of Manila all night to prevent unexpected events. There was a heavy thunderstorm after midnight, so the people's hearts were slightly at ease. In yesterday's battle, two military policemen were killed and twelve were injured, and 55 rebels were killed and 22 were injured. (4th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Rebels Have No Discipline</p>
<p>(Manila) The authorities searched for the leaders of the riot all day and have arrested several of them. The rest have fled. The rebels' will was not very firm. After losing their leaders, they disintegrated as a whole. The rebels had no discipline at all. For five yuan, you could buy a so-called "lieutenant colonel" position. The rebels had no uniforms. Most of them wore yellow pants and miscellaneous shirts. The weapons they carried were various guns and sharp knives for cutting sugarcane. This rebellion was one of the most violent in the modern history of the Philippines. The situation in Manila suddenly became tense, as rumors spread that the rebels planned to attack the city together. The fiercest battle was in Cavite, where 60 rebels were killed. The authorities now claim that the police force is capable of containing the rebels and does not need the assistance of 18,000 British troops stationed near Manila. (3rd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Advocating Continued Rule</p>
<p>(Washington) A government spokesperson declared today that the US Army Department has not officially learned of the Philippine riots, nor has it formally paid attention to this minority rebellion caused by people being exploited. The Senate Territories Committee has also not formally paid attention to this matter, but all the members are now paying attention to the current situation as reported in the newspapers. Senator Kopeyren said that the Philippine independence case cannot be implemented. If the United States wants to prevent a second rebellion, it must take rapid changes. We can only continue to rule the Philippines, otherwise it will cause endless disputes. (3rd National Telegram)</p>
<p>The U.S. Did Not Express Surprise</p>
<p>(Washington) The Philippine riots did not cause surprise to Washington officials. Anyone who knows the situation in the Philippines expected this incident. Some parties believe that the life of the Philippine Republic may be hit by this. The situation in the Philippines after it becomes independent can be inferred from this. However, some people also say that once public sentiment is disturbed, this kind of incident can occur anywhere. Philippine Governor-General Murphy, who is on leave in the United States, expressed regret after hearing about the change, but said that the riots would not spread. Espalla, the leader of the radical party of Filipinos in the United States, spoke in Stockton, California today, denying that the riots were caused by the radical party, saying that the party in power now wanted to destroy the radical party, hence this claim. Senator McKeller, one of the Philippine inspection committee members, is now submitting a minority report to the Senate, saying that the people of the Philippines should abandon their independence plan, because Filipinos are not yet suitable for a republican system, and the new constitution is suitable for establishing a dictatorship. The committee chairman Tadings has not yet submitted a majority report. (3rd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Currency Experts Criticize U.S. Government Silver Policy: Forcibly Increasing the Price of Silver Will Eventually Lead to a Terrible Fall: Peruvian Government Prohibits Silver Exports</h3>
<p>(New York) Currency expert Balb published an article today, strongly criticizing the government's silver policy, claiming that the actual value of silver is only 25 cents per ounce, and the Treasury Department's raising of the price of silver is unfounded. Any commodity price can be raised by means of purchase and hoarding, but it will eventually lead to a terrible fall. The true value of silver is actually falling, for two reasons: (1) The production of by-products such as copper and other metals has increased. (2) The public buys less silver than before. Balb claims that the Treasury Department's plan, in addition to the silver already purchased, still needs to purchase 1,120,000,000 ounces of silver, which is actually oversupply. The world silver price rose again today. Heintz &amp; Harman Company set the price of this large ingot of silver at 72.5 cents per ounce, up 1 1/4 cents from yesterday's listed price. This increase was caused by the rise in silver prices in London and Montreal, and the rise in silver prices in London was caused by continued purchases of silver from India and the sudden liquidation of silver. (3rd National Telegram)</p>
<p>Lima: Peru today banned the export of silver to prevent unscrupulous merchants from melting silver coins for profit. According to the government decree, newly mined silver can still be exported, but melting silver coins is prohibited. All exported silver must be marked with its source. Silver coins are decreasing day by day in the market, and commerce is greatly hindered. The government took this action, which is the same as the one recently implemented in Mexico.

<h3>World Naval Conference to be Convened in October: Plan of the British Naval Minister: U.S. Has Not Received Official Report</h3>
<p>(Paris) Naval Minister Pietri returned from London today, saying that a world naval conference will be convened in October. Pietri discussed the German submarine construction plan with the British Naval Minister in London. Pietri declared that the idea of convening a world naval conference of various countries in October was decided during his meeting with British Naval Minister Monsell. He and the British authorities discussed the German submarine construction issue in detail. Britain and France have the same views on Germany's violation of the Treaty of Versailles, but France will probably take a neutral attitude towards this matter, and Britain will be responsible for protesting to Germany, because this matter is closely related to Britain. (4th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Paris telegram said that the news of the convening of a world naval conference in October is of great interest to U.S. officials. However, it is said that no official report has been received yet. Naval officials said that the United States welcomes the reconvening of the London Conference. British Naval Minister Monsell may have this plan, but he has not notified the U.S. government. (3rd National Telegram)</p>

Although the price of this purchase of silver by the Treasury Department was fluctuating recently, the average price was 68 cents per ounce. (3rd National Telegram)</p>
<h3>French Foreign Ministry Officially Announces the Full Text of the Franco-Soviet Agreement: Divided into Two Parts: Treaty and Protocol: Effective Period Stipulated as Five Years: Limited to Europe, Not Involving the Far East</h3>
<p>(Paris) After the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty was initialed yesterday by Foreign Minister Laval and Soviet Ambassador Potemkin, the full text has now been officially announced by the French Foreign Ministry. The agreement is divided into two parts: one is the treaty, which consists of five articles in addition to the preamble, and the other is the protocol, which consists of two articles. The following is a summary:</p>
<p>1. Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty</p>
<p>The French Republic and the Soviet Union, in order to consolidate peace, guarantee the implementation of the Covenant of the League of Nations, and conclude a European agreement, have signed the treaty as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: France and the Soviet Union agree that if threatened by a European country, they shall immediately consult each other on the steps to be taken in accordance with Article 10 of the Covenant of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Article 2: In accordance with Article 15, Paragraph 7 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, if France and the Soviet Union are attacked without provocation, the two countries agree to immediately assist each other.</p>
<p>Article 3: Article 16 of the Covenant of the League of Nations stipulates that a member state that engages in aggression in disregard of the provisions of Articles 13 and 15 of the Covenant shall be regarded as committing a crime against all member states of the League of Nations. In such a case, France and the Soviet Union agree to immediately assist each other. If a non-member state of the League of Nations engages in aggression and targets France and the Soviet Union in accordance with the provisions of Article 17, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Covenant, then France and the Soviet Union also agree to immediately assist each other.</p>
<p>Article 4: This treaty does not restrict the steps that the League of Nations should take to guarantee peace.</p>
<p>Article 5: This treaty shall be ratified by the governments of the signatory countries as soon as possible after it is signed and registered with the Secretariat of the League of Nations. The effective period of this treaty is set at five years. If one of the signatory countries does not declare its termination within one year before the expiration date, this treaty shall be effective indefinitely, but the signatory countries may terminate it later with one year's advance notice.</p>
<p>2. Franco-Soviet Protocol</p>
<p>Article 1: In accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of this treaty, if the Administrative Council of the League of Nations passes a recommendation to resolve the dispute in accordance with Article 15 of the Covenant, then one of the signatories has the obligation to prepare to immediately assist the other party in accordance with the recommendation of the Administrative Council. For this reason, the signatories agree that in such cases, the signatories should act jointly to ensure that the Administrative Council submits a recommendation within the necessary and rapid time. If the Administrative Council does not issue a recommendation or the recommendation is not unanimously adopted, then the obligation of mutual assistance of the signatories shall still apply. The signatories also agree that the mutual assistance agreement stipulated in the treaty refers specifically to the actual invasion of the territory of one of the signatories.</p>
<p>Article 2: The signatories agree that if the provisions contained in the treaty contradict the treaty obligations borne by one of the signatories, and are sufficient to cause one party to suffer international sanctions, then the provisions shall not apply.</p>
<p>Article 3: The signatories mutually recognize that, at a considerable period of time and after mutual agreement, they may freely participate in similar agreements, whether directly or indirectly, depending on the appropriate circumstances. After participating in this agreement, the constraints arising from the various agreements shall replace the constraints arising from this treaty. The government of the signatory countries declares that this treaty is the result of previous negotiations. Previous negotiations have sought to establish a security agreement that includes all countries in Northeast Europe, such as the Soviet Union, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the Baltic countries adjacent to the territory of the Soviet Union. In addition, a tripartite mutual assistance agreement should be concluded by the Soviet Union, France, and Germany, stipulating that if one of the three countries invades another country, then the other country should assist the invaded country. Although this agreement is still hoped for by the signatories, the situation in all parties has not allowed it to be established so far. For this reason, the signatories agree that the constraints stipulated in the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty may only apply within the scope of the above-mentioned tripartite mutual assistance agreement. Furthermore, France and the Soviet Union concluded a non-aggression treaty on November 29, 1932. The restraint of this non-aggression may be extended to make it universally applicable. For this reason, if one of the signatories is attacked, and the aggressor is not a country listed in the above-mentioned tripartite mutual assistance agreement, then the other party shall not provide any assistance to the aggressor in the event of a conflict.

<h3>U.S. President Makes Explicit Statement: Will Not Invade Canada; Recently Warned House Military Affairs Committee That Their Statements Do Not Represent the Government</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt today explicitly stated here that the United States will not take defensive or aggressive actions against Canada. President Roosevelt recently sent a letter to the House Military Affairs Committee, warning them that, if necessary, he will exercise his authority as Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy to prohibit the publication of any statements that could be viewed as unfriendly by other countries. Someone asked President Roosevelt about this, so President Roosevelt made this statement today in response. President Roosevelt also said that he considers the incident arising from the statements made by key officials of the War Department to the Military Affairs Committee to be over. However, he hopes that the Canadian and other governments and people will read his warning to the Military Affairs Committee.

President Roosevelt immediately warned the committee and stated that such statements do not represent the policy of the government or the Commander-in-Chief. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<h3>Mandate Issue</h3>

Therefore, it has nothing to do with the withdrawal issue. This is a well-known fact. Japan will continue the mandate according to the established policy, which is natural. No matter how Germany expresses its opposition, Japan can only adhere to the magnanimity of a great power, resolutely move forward according to the established policy, and not confront this opposing argument.

<h3>Situation of Bandit Suppression in Sichuan and Hubei</h3>
<p>Zhang Xueliang and Wang Jialie Arrive in Hankou from Guiyang. He Long Flees Back and is Immediately Surrounded and Suppressed. Hankou Dispatch. Zhang Xueliang flew to [illegible] from Hankou yesterday to visit Chairman Chiang and report on his inspection of the Shaanxi troops representing the inspection team and his meetings with Liu Zhi and Yang Hucheng, as well as to request instructions on suppressing the remnant bandits. On the 3rd, he flew back to Hankou from Guiyang. Wang Jialie, the former chairman of the Guizhou Provincial Government and the current commander-in-chief of the Second Route Army for Bandit Suppression, also arrived in Hankou by plane from Guizhou on the same day. They will go to Beijing in the coming days. Since Zhu and Mao's main force fled west into Yunnan, Zhenfeng, Xingren, and Luodian in Guizhou have been successively recovered by the Guizhou army. There are no more bandit traces within the territory. Chairman Chiang is urging the new provincial government to handle local post-disaster relief. Wang Jialie's Second Route Bandit Suppression Army has also been reorganized and is ready for use in preventing Zhu and Mao and pacifying the local area. Xu Xiangqian's force in northern Sichuan has repeatedly attacked [illegible]Jiang without success and is now in decline. There are no remnant bandits in Qingchuan and Pingwu. Deng Xihou's troops took advantage of the exhaustion of the bandits and launched a full-scale attack on the 30th. Within two days, they went south to Zitong and north to Zhao Hua. The left and right wings of the bandits were completely shaken. They have abandoned their plan to attack Jiangyou and retreated with their main force to Jiange and Jianmen Pass. The Sichuan army and Hu Zongnan's troops are currently flanking the bandit area in both Jian, and they can meet in the coming days. Although the bandits are trapped in a corner and have mountainous terrain for defense, it is difficult to hold out for long. Heavy troops are stationed in the north and south, and there is the solid defense of the Jialing River [illegible]Jiang in the east and west, making it difficult to break through. At the time of the total collapse of the remnant bandits in Sichuan and Guizhou, the He Long and Xiao Ke bandit forces in western Hunan suddenly fled back, and the fighting has been fierce in recent days. The bandits originally planned to enter Sichuan and transfer to Guizhou from Yongshun and Baojing to join forces with Zhu and Mao, but because the defenses of Youyang and Xiushan were solid, they could not break in. They then attempted to detour through western Hubei, but Xu Yuanquan advanced to Enshi to supervise the deployment of defenses in Laifeng and Xianfeng, giving them a head-on blow. Both the northwest roads were difficult to pass. It has recently been reported that Zhu and Mao fled west to the Yunnan border, and their reinforcements have been cut off. If they flee into Guizhou again, the army will gather and they will inevitably be completely annihilated. They urgently fled back from the Longshan-Sangzhi border towards Dayong and Cili, attempting a final struggle. The Hunan and Hubei bandit suppression forces are dividing into two routes to surround and suppress them, and the bandits are very numerous. He Long himself is now based in Tiangu, E, and Liao Village. Xiao Ke is based in Malou and Mujiatang. Their losses are about 70-80% compared to before. The commander-in-chief of one route of the pursuing army, He Jian, is still stationed in Changde to supervise the suppression. The pacification commissioner in Hubei, He Chengjun, flew to Shashi from Hankou on the 3rd to make some arrangements, and then flew to Changde from Sha on the 4th to discuss plans to eliminate the bandits with He Jian, and then went to Enshi to meet Xu Yuanquan and give instructions.

<h3>Hebei Provincial Government Postpones Moving South</h3>
<p>- Completed This Year's General Budget -</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence. It was previously said that the Hebei Provincial Government would be moved to Baoding in May. After inquiring with relevant parties, it is known that it cannot be realized in the short term. In late last month, Provincial Commissioner Cha Yao was ordered to go to Baoding to deliver a military training speech on behalf of Yu Xuezhong and to survey the new site of the provincial government. According to his report upon his return, the available buildings in Baoding are the Cao Family Garden, the former Governor's Office, and the former Qing Dynasty Baoding Imperial Palace. The Imperial Palace is old and dilapidated, with collapsed walls and many leaking roofs. If repairs are made, it will cost more than 400,000 yuan. The old Governor's Office is relatively tidy, but it also requires more than 300,000 yuan to transform it to be suitable for joint office work. The provincial treasury this year feels even more empty, and it is difficult to raise such a huge amount of money in a short time. The province is exhausted from rushing to handle post-yellow disaster relief and agricultural assistance, as well as repairing the dikes, all of which require funds. Therefore, this non-essential plan can only be delayed. The central government has not adopted a positive attitude towards the southward move of the provincial government, so the province plans to wait until the treasury funds are slightly more abundant before proceeding with the southward move and joint office work. The regulations have all been drafted, but there is currently no need to implement them, so they will be implemented after the move. After the move south, a provincial government headquarters and a Tianjin Garrison Command will be established in Tianjin. The commander may be concurrently held by Yu Xuezhong, so as to unify military and police power for convenient command in emergencies. The location will be within the current provincial government.</p>
<p>The general budget for the entire province of Hebei for the 24th year has been repeatedly revised to balance revenue and expenditure, but the total revenue of the province is less than 18 million yuan, while the expenditure is 23 million yuan, a difference of about 5 million. The Finance Department has convened meetings of various relevant departments in the province many times, planning to save money by reducing personnel and streamlining government. However, as a result, all departments stated that they had difficulties, that personnel could not be further reduced, and that there was no way to streamline government. After postponing for several months, the Finance Department came up with a plan, which is to delay the payment of this year's due foreign debts. The total amount of such funds is more than 5 million yuan. With the savings in expenditure, the budget was able to be drafted and balanced. It was reviewed and approved by the provincial departments last week and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval before implementation. The major sources of income for Hebei Province include land tax, which is 6.6 million yuan per year, miscellaneous taxes, which are more than 5 million yuan, and business tax, which is more than 600,000 yuan. Starting from the next fiscal year, the broker tax will be changed to business tax for brokerages, and the miscellaneous tax will cancel the contractor system. After the change, income may decrease. Since spring, droughts and winds have raged in various places, damaging many crops, which directly affects the rural economy and indirectly affects the collection of land tax. Commerce in various counties is also extremely depressed. Therefore, although the financial difficulties of this year have been overcome, there may still be financial constraints next year. (2nd)</p>
<h3>Chao-Shan Judiciary Arrests Many Lawyers</h3>
<p>- Due to Lawyers Accusing Judges of Corruption -</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence. In recent years, there have been many unsatisfactory things in the Chaozhou-Meizhou judiciary. It is common to see lawsuits dragging on for years without resolution. Sometimes, both parties cannot even settle the case if they want to. The county sub-courts have more than ten kinds of fees, such as copying fees, delivery fees, court attendant fees, sandal money, message fees, tea money, and wine money. All sub-court officials issue announcements abolishing these malpractices when they take office, but with little effect. As the saying goes, "It's good to fight a lawsuit, it's good to eat dog feces." Sometimes a case enters the yamen and is never resolved. Therefore, the dignity of the judiciary is swept away. Recently, the Chamber of Commerce, by order of the provincial government, the East District Commissioner's Office, and the municipal government, cleared the assets of the bankrupt Chen Yuan Da store. It was scheduled to be auctioned on April 23. However, on the day of the auction, the Chaozhou-Meizhou court suddenly issued a preliminary injunction, prohibiting the auction, causing the Chamber of Commerce's credibility and the government's prestige to be lost. Also, there are more than 150 lawyers in Shantou City in Chaozhou-Meizhou counties, 70 lawyers in Meixian, and 40 to 50 in other counties. The lawyers' business is quite busy. Among the lawyers in Shantou, there is Lin Kai from Jieyang, who recently accepted a lawsuit involving a certain Huang, which has been dragging on for a long time. Last month, Xie Yingzhou, the president of the Guangdong High Court, came to Chaozhou-Shantou to inspect. Lin wrote to Xie, stating that Tan Rongsheng, the judge who interrogated Huang's case, was greedy and vile, and had sent someone to solicit bribes from him unsuccessfully, so he favored [the other party], causing the case to be delayed and not resolved fairly. The letter also stated that this was a letter for which he took responsibility, and could be viewed as an ordinary friendly letter or as an indictment. After reading it, Xie was furious and immediately issued an order to the Shantou High Court Branch and the District Court to thoroughly investigate the case. Unexpectedly, on April 12, the District Court Procuratorate sent a letter inviting Lin Kai to the court for a discussion. Lin was immediately arrested and detained. There was no summons or bailiff involved at the time, so few people knew about it. On the same day, Prosecutor Zhong Yingchun also said that lawyer Lin Gong was invited to the court for a discussion and was also detained. Lin Gong had previously served as the chief prosecutor of the Shantou Municipal Procuratorate and a clerk in the High Court Branch. It is said that he was involved in Lin Kai's accusation against Tan Rongsheng. It is also heard that in his testimony in court, Lin Kai said that Judge Tan sent someone to solicit 1,000 yuan, and he offered 300 yuan at the time. The case now has very large ramifications, and the legal community is paying close attention to it. There is also lawyer Tan Bingkui from Fengshun County, who accused Li Bingzhong, a judge of the Chaoan Court, of corruption last month and presented various pieces of evidence. On April 14, Tan Bingkui went to Fengshun to appear in court to defend a certain case and was detained and shackled. On the 18th, he was escorted to Jieyang. Some saw Tan sitting in a long-distance bus with iron chains clanking. On the 19th, he was interrogated by Labor Tenglan, a prosecutor of the Jieyang Court. After asking a few questions, he was sent to the county government for detention. On the 22nd, he was escorted to the Shantou High Court. It is heard that the court believes that Tan and Lin's cases are related, so they were exchanged for detention in order to facilitate the investigation. The Shantou Bar Association was outraged by the above two cases. Since lawyers cannot protect themselves, how can they protect others? A general meeting was held on the evening of the 18th to discuss the matter, but they kept it secret. On the 19th, they sent representatives Ma Zongjie and Zheng Ruizhang, etc., six people, to the court to question them, orally proposing that the people in the case should be investigated together and dealt with impartially. Wang Yingjie, the president of the District Court, agreed with them. On the 20th, Tan Rongsheng, who was specifically responsible for the matter, was temporarily suspended from his post, but it is not yet known how it will be resolved in the future.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Protects Silkworm Cocoon Markets</h3>

Article 5: All funds returned by [blank] merchants via land routes should be escorted by police teams dispatched by the counties along the routes, and those via waterways should be escorted by boats dispatched by the nearest Provincial Water Police. If it is necessary to pass through both land and water routes, it should be escorted alternately by the county and the Provincial Water Police. However, each cocoon merchant should notify the number of funds, the starting and ending points of transportation, the places and dates of alternation in advance for thoroughness.

<h3>Suzhou Famous Opium Pill Seller Arrested</h3>
<p>Ren Lao Si (Hong Chang), a famous seller of red pills (opium pills), who lives at No. 12 Wuren Pier, outside the Chang Gate, was discovered by the Security Team Brigade Headquarters. On the afternoon of the 3rd, a team was dispatched to the address together with Chen, the patrol officer in charge of the third branch bureau, to arrest Ren Lao Si and found more than one hundred red pills, ten taels of opium, letters, and other items. He was taken to the team for interrogation and confessed that the red pill headquarters was located in a certain place in Wuxi. The Brigade Headquarters immediately dispatched personnel to Wuxi that night to search for the headquarters.</p>
<h3>Major Conflict Between Wives and Concubines of Color Material Tycoon</h3>
<p>Chen Xueqing, a color material tycoon residing at No. 6 Wuchang Lane, Chengdu Road, Shanghai, is 64 years old. Two years ago, he met a prostitute named Ye Xiuying at the Tianyunlou in the Shui'an Company. She was only 18 years old. He fell in love with her at first sight. Chen paid 500 yuan to redeem Xiuying and rented a house for her to live with him at Tianfuli No. [illegible] near Xiaonanmen. Xiuying disliked Chen's old age and became acquainted with a young man. Last month, she left without saying goodbye and fled to Suzhou with her lover, hiding at No. 5 Lime Kiln outside Fengmen, her mother's home. Chen Xueqing heard about this and secretly came to Suzhou on the 3rd, opened a room at the Dalu Hotel, and brought Xiuying to talk about everything. Chen's wife, Mrs. Wang, learned about this and followed him to Suzhou, accompanied by several younger sisters. They went directly to the Dalu Hotel. Upon meeting each other, they disagreed and the women started fighting. Mrs. Zhang Wang, Mrs. Wang's sister, was hit in the head by glass and bled profusely. The police on duty learned about this and separated the two sides and took them to the branch bureau for interrogation. On the 4th, they were transferred to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. It is heard that someone is now mediating, hoping for a peaceful resolution.</p>
<h3>Motor Dispute Mediation Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>The Suzhou Silk Weaving and other ten industries' trade associations strongly disputed with the Electric Company over shortening the motor electricity fee. After the Central Construction Committee formulated a fee reduction plan, the industries considered it satisfactory, but the Electric Company believed that it suffered too much loss and could not agree. The county Chamber of Commerce convened representatives of various industries, Liu Fuqing and Lu Jigao, etc., yesterday (4th) afternoon to hold a meeting for mediation. Chairman Cheng [illegible]xiang, due to the disagreement between the two sides, dispersed without any good results.</p>
<h3>Jiading City Experiences Yellow Terror</h3>
<p>The County Public Security Bureau has emphasized public health and banned open-air latrines. They have issued announcements and ordered the police to advise residents to add pit covers within a limited time, but few residents have complied. When the deadline expired some time ago, thousands of open pits throughout the city were overturned by the police dispatched by the bureau. However, there are only two public toilets in the city, and most residents' chamber pots are full and have nowhere to be dumped. The problem of excretion, which is as important as diet, cannot be solved. Street gossip and discussions abound, and people are criticizing it, resulting in yellow terror. Recently, many people have been dumping feces into the river at night.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Fire Scare Kills Old Man</h3>
<p>Zhou Genrong's residence at No. 5, Gaoyang Lane, Houtaiping Lane, outside Guangfu Gate, suddenly caught fire at about 10:00 pm on the [3rd]. Thick smoke billowed up immediately. By the time Zhou and others woke up, the fire had already broken through the roof, affecting the neighboring houses of Genquan, Fan Amao, Ma Jinyu, Wang Tongchen, and five other families. The fire was eventually extinguished after the fire brigades of various sections arrived and used water pumps to put it out. However, the five households, including Zhou's, were completely destroyed, and no belongings were salvaged. The fire also spread to Wang Qingji's rickshaw shop in the front alley, burning two coffins. A total of six rooms were burned, with losses amounting to about 5,000 yuan. When the fire broke out, Hui Shenchun, a 63-year-old resident of No. 7 who worked in the anti-smuggling camp, suddenly heard the fire alarm. He was so terrified that his expression changed drastically, and he collapsed and died shortly after.</p>
<h3>Joking Argument Leads to Sibling's Fatal Stab</h3>
<p>Wu A'jin, a resident of Meiji Shang Village near Fu Bridge in the Ninth District, has one son and one daughter. The son, A'rong, is 15 years old, and the daughter, Quan'yun, is 17 years old. Both are students at Gaoqiao Public School. One afternoon, after school, the siblings each took a sickle and went to the fields to gather grass. At first, they were joking with each other, but then they started fighting. A'rong, in a moment of anger, stabbed Quan'yun in the anus with the sickle he was holding. Quan'yun immediately fainted and fell to the ground, her trousers soaked in blood, unconscious. A'rong, realizing the disaster, rushed to tell his parents. They carried Quan'yun to the city and took her to Puren Hospital for treatment. Unfortunately, due to the injury being in a vital area, she died at about 1:00 pm yesterday. It was truly tragic.</p>
<h3>Model District Vandalized</h3>
<p>Due to the lack of spring silkworm eggs this year, there was great panic. The Sericulture Model District purchased Japanese silkworm eggs for the market. This county was allocated 18,000 sheets. However, when they were sold at Wuxi Hotel and Dadong Hotel on the morning of the day before yesterday, thousands of villagers scrambled to buy them, causing the roads to be blocked. Because the supply could not meet the demand, disturbances arose. Dadong Hotel was completely vandalized, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that because the villagers could not obtain the silkworm eggs, they flocked to the Sericulture Model District outside the East Gate to demand to buy silkworm eggs. They waited until about 7:00 pm. The Model District could not cope, so a few unscrupulous individuals took the lead, and everyone followed suit, completely vandalizing the Model District office. The few security guards present were unable to stop them. They rushed to report to Feng Ziqian, the leader of the Third Squad, who led all the armed squad members to the scene to suppress the unrest. The villagers then dispersed. After this incident, some opportunistic individuals took the opportunity to sell silkworm eggs they had previously purchased at low prices to the villagers at high prices. The villagers, in urgent need, had to buy them at a painful price. These people made a considerable profit. Zhou Yuanxun, the head of the Model District, and Cai Jingde, the director of the office, went to the provincial capital yesterday to seek instructions on how to handle the aftermath. It is said that this shortage of silkworm eggs is unprecedented and involves complex internal issues that outsiders cannot understand.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: Gu Shan Town Busts Opium Dealers</h3>
<p>Yong Rongsheng, a resident of Gushan Township in the Fifth District, is strong and skilled in martial arts. He is a known dealer of opium pills. The other day, Yang [Officer's Title], a patrol officer from the Yang [Area] Public Security Third Substation, led police to search his house. They found more than three hundred opium pills in Yong's wife, Zhang's, bag. Yong and his wife were arrested on the spot. They also found sixteen opium pills and several smoking paraphernalia in the house of Lu [Area] Lu. It was claimed that Lu Sang and Fei Xu in the same town were also selling opium pills. They were all arrested. Officer Lu then took more than one thousand confiscated opium pills to the county on the 2nd for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Jingjiang: Jingjiang Daily Newspaper Suspended</h3>
<p>The Jingjiang Daily published a short story on the first of this month, the content of which completely described love and had no improper actions. County Magistrate Li Jinfang believed that it harmed the reputation of Zou Jinong, the director of the midwifery department attached to the opium suppression office, and his personal reputation, and was furious. At 3:00 pm, he arrested Liu Jianfan, the editor of the newspaper, and detained him in the detention center. He was later transferred to the local prison and forbidden from seeing his family. In the middle of the night, he sent several armed security team members to tie up Liu Jianfan with ropes and escort him to the newspaper office for a search, prohibiting pedestrians and cutting off traffic. All the manuscripts of the newspaper were searched thoroughly. Yesterday, he sent armed security team members to force the newspaper to stop publishing. It is not known how this matter will be resolved in the future.</p>
<h3>Mingguang: Completion of Eight Main Roads in Sixian County</h3>

<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Government Negotiates Spring Loan with Shanghai Banks; Yesterday, the Banking Group Decided to Lend 1.8 Million First</h3>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, in the autumn of last year, the Construction Department and the Finance Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Government borrowed 3 million yuan from Shanghai China, Jiaotong, and 14 other banks to alleviate the drought and promote autumn silkworm farming. This year, the Zhejiang Construction [Area] Silk Control Committee has drafted a 24-year spring silk control plan and is negotiating with the Hangzhou branch of the Bank of China in Hangzhou to borrow another 3 million yuan, following the example of the autumn silkworm loan, to implement control and improvement of silk using political power and scientific methods to restore prosperity.

<h3>Fifth Day of Literacy Promotion Week: Today’s Film Propaganda: Republic World and Other Theaters Screen Literacy Education Films; All City Cinemas Add Specially Made Slides</h3>
<p>Today is the fifth day of the literacy campaign promotion week in this city, and it is Film Promotion Day. All city cinemas are participating in the promotion. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Entertainment Promotion</p>
<p>Yesterday was Entertainment Promotion Day. In addition to all performers on stages and in amusement parks throughout the city incorporating literacy campaign content into their performances, the Municipal Education Center held a makeup lecture in its lecture hall at 10:00 AM. The play, titled "Opening the Eyes of the Blind," featured Xu Yajie, Zhang Shuzhen, Qian Jinglu, and others portraying the suffering of illiteracy. The story revolved around A-Da, a villager who, due to illiteracy, mistakenly used counterfeit tickets, accidentally wandered into an area with rabid dogs, and was bitten. Later, due to illiteracy, he mistakenly took poison, leading to his death. The performance was quite captivating.</p>
<p>Film Promotion</p>
<p>Today is Film Promotion Day. The Literacy Education Committee has contacted cinemas to screen films with literacy education significance. In addition to the Shanghai Grand Theater, which already screened films early yesterday, today from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, the Republic Grand Theater will screen "Golden Age" by Yi Hua Film Company, and the World Grand Theater will screen "The Way of a Woman" by Ming Xing Film Company, inviting illiterate members of the public to attend free of charge.</p>
<p>Slide Screenings</p>
<p>The committee has notified all cinemas to add specially made slides with the following messages: (1) Having eyes but not knowing how to read is like being half-blind. (2) Only because you don't know how to read do you suffer all kinds of hardships. (3) Using both your hands and your brain is the mark of a great old man. (4) Opening a book is beneficial; practice makes perfect. (5) There is a municipal literacy school nearby, offering free books; graduate in two months. Please spend a little time each day to study. (6) Employers should give their employees the opportunity to become literate. (7) Those who are literate should take on the responsibility of teaching others to read. (8) Teach others as soon as you know, don't be a knowledge hoarder. (9) Teaching others to read is more virtuous than building a seven-story pagoda. (10) The literacy movement is a patriotic movement with unexpected benefits.</p>
<p>Mayor’s Broadcast</p>
<p>Mayor Wu gave a radio address on the Shanghai Broadcasting Station the night before, titled "The Basic Movement for Saving and Building the Nation." What follows is a summary of his speech: Today is the first day of the Literacy Education Promotion Week held by the Shanghai Literacy Education Committee. The purpose is to enable citizens from all walks of life in Shanghai, whether literate or illiterate, to understand and fully grasp the meaning and purpose of implementing compulsory literacy education in this city. Regarding this aspect, I have already given public lectures at the Municipal Government in the past two weeks, and major newspapers in this port have also reported on it. Today, I am taking this opportunity to add a simple supplement. In the current stage of China, there are truly a hundred holes and a hundred things waiting to be done. From the perspective of national salvation, there is simply nothing that does not require us to make urgent efforts. However, in the steps of nation-building, these many arduous and important tasks waiting to be done must be prioritized and ordered. Therefore, the first of the six patriotic movements stipulated by the Nationalist Party was the literacy movement. From this point of view, the implementation of literacy education is truly the starting point for the construction of a new China and the most basic task that those who bear actual political responsibility today should complete first. The development of a nation, the progress of culture, and the evolution of all human history are fundamentally driven by knowledge. The level of knowledge not only affects the rise and fall of culture but also determines the prosperity and decline of a nation. Therefore, in the context of historical evolution, education is not only the initial stage of nation-building but also the starting point of human civilization. The decline of national fortune stems from the neglect of education, while national strength is rooted in the popularization of education. Under this principle, the literacy movement is undoubtedly the urgent task that should be prioritized today to save the nation and revive the nation. Leaving aside abstract theories, and considering the current situation in reality, countries with universal education, such as Germany, not only have their scientific and cultural development admired by various countries, but also their national resilience and the rising tide of their national revival are astonishing to various countries. Secondly, the rise of Italy after the war and the completion of the Soviet Union's five-year plan, if fundamentally analyzed, are not simply the effects of totalitarianism or planning but are due to the sharp reduction in the proportion of illiterates. Conversely, the illiteracy rate in our China averages over 80%. The majority of the people are fundamentally ignorant and unable to fulfill their responsibilities as citizens, thereby depleting the vitality of our entire nation. Therefore, previous patriotic movements have failed to be understood and supported by the general public, and have failed to achieve widespread and great practical results. Therefore, our principles for saving and building the nation today should, on the one hand, catch up from behind, and on the other hand, address the root of the problem by implementing literacy education. This is the work of addressing the root cause of the Chinese nation today. Based on this principle and this belief, we will implement compulsory education with the greatest determination and perseverance, starting from July 1st this year, and strive to completely solve the problem of illiteracy in this city within a year. Shanghai is the central hub of culture and economy in our country. The success or failure of this literacy education movement, or the quality of its effectiveness, can truly affect the perceptions of people across the country and can serve as a test of whether future patriotic movements in China can succeed. Therefore, on the one hand, we must do our best to find ways to enable the illiterate people in this city to recognize at least one character, and at the same time, we earnestly hope that the literate citizens in this city will also do their part, jointly cooperate to persuade and promote, and teach people to read, in order to create a warm and enthusiastic atmosphere of literacy learning in this city and complete this basic movement for saving and building the nation.</p>

<h3>Wang Shiying and Hu Jianzhong Returned Home Yesterday After Inspecting Japanese Cooperative Enterprises; Hu Also Inspected News Industry in Japan</h3>
<p>The China Cooperative Society previously sent four people, Wang Shike, Hu Jianzhong, Hou Houpei, and Hou, to Japan to inspect cooperative enterprises, starting on April 3. It has been more than a month now. It is learned that Mr. Hou and others returned early two weeks ago due to matters. Mr. Wang and Mr. Hu, as well as Mrs. Hu, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. The regions inspected by the two gentlemen this time include dozens of places such as Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, Kyoto, Yokohama, Aichi, Shizuoka, Nagano, and Fukuoka, and as far as Sapporo and Hakodate in Hokkaido. In addition to inspecting the actual situation of local cooperative enterprises, they also met with entrepreneurs and scholars. Famous Japanese agricultural economists, such as Sato Tsuguji, Nasu Hiroshi, Kodaira Kenichi, Tobata Seiichi, Sengoku Kota郎, Makino Terutomo, Hatano, and Tanaka Sadame, have all been consulted to exchange opinions. According to the two gentlemen, cooperative enterprises in Japan have been established for decades, and their history is far earlier than that of our country. At present, cooperative organizations (called industrial associations in Japan) are spread all over the country and are extremely developed. Their strength is particularly strong. The government is fully supporting the development of cooperation. The Japanese government's Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has specially established the Economic Regeneration Department, whose work is mostly focused on cooperative enterprises and agricultural finance. The economies of general farmers have gradually become stable due to the development of cooperation, and the production industry relies particularly on cooperation and is becoming increasingly prosperous. In Hokkaido and other places, which have suffered from disasters and crop failures in recent years, farmers have mostly been spared from freezing and starvation thanks to cooperative enterprises. The production of Japanese silk and citrus fruits is even more surprising due to the use of cooperative organizations, with the amount of exports to foreign countries every year being extremely surprising. However, there are also many shortcomings in Japanese cooperative enterprises. For example, the duplication of systems and the divergence of regulations cannot be said to be perfect. This point is also admitted by famous Japanese scholars. Mr. Wang and Mr. Hu have obtained a large amount of important information on this trip and plan to compile an inspection report for printing within two or three months. The two gentlemen will stay in Shanghai for about one or two days and then return to Hangzhou.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Jianzhong also inspected the news industry in Japan on this trip. He visited most of the large and small newspapers and the News Agency in Tokyo, Osaka, Hokkaido, and Fukuoka. He also visited the Journalism Research Room of Tokyo Imperial University, the most prestigious in Japan, and met with Ono Hideo, a Japanese theorist of journalism. According to Mr. Hu, Japanese newspapers tend to be large-scale enterprises. It goes without saying that newspapers in large cities are large, and even local newspapers are very large in scale. Among them, the Osaka and Tokyo Asahi and Mainichi newspapers dominate the Japanese news industry. Their capital power makes it difficult for local newspapers to survive. The two newspapers have as many as 20 or 30 local editions, and the number of issues is six times for morning editions and three times for evening editions. The sales volume of each newspaper is more than 800,000 or 900,000 copies, and some even reach 1.2 million. The number of newspaper readers across the country, except for the north, where education is not yet widespread and is relatively backward, has almost reached saturation in other places. The reasons why the Japanese news industry has reached this point are that in addition to the efforts of the newspaper industry itself, the use of large capital, the popularization of education, and the special convenience of transportation are all important factors. Its current situation is quite different compared to the news industry in our country. However, if reporters across the country can catch up quickly, it is not too late.</p>

Since the beginning, citizens in this city have joined very enthusiastically, and there have been several applications every day from as far away as Tianjin, Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, which shows that the people across the country enthusiastically support the aviation-saving movement. Regarding the collection of aviation-saving donations from various groups, the collection will begin within days, such as the freight car industry and the brick and ash transportation industry. Other industries are still in progress. The Aviation-Saving Airplane Model Exhibition will be held within the month. In addition to the aviation authorities providing materials, airplane models and machinery propaganda products have been solicited from various foreign firms. In addition to the chief secretary being responsible, Zhang Yuliang, Chen Shuo, Wei Jianxin, Bao Lengxue, Song Zheng, and Liu Songtao have been assigned to prepare. In addition, Xiao Youmei, the captain of Team 692, plans to hold a Jin Music Concert, and the proceeds will be used for aviation-saving funds. Preparations have begun, and all staff of this office are responsible for preparations and selling tickets. The Fudan Drama Society of Fudan University plans to hold two days of plays, and the proceeds will be used to help aviation-saving funds. A letter of approval has been sent, requesting them to specify the date, time, and location so that preparations can begin. Then, the discussion focused on various issues related to solicitation and fundraising propaganda. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Tax Bureau Replies to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: Warns Stamp Inspection Officers to Refrain from Any Harassment in the Future</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously forwarded a letter from the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association to the Ministry of Finance, ordering the Stamp Tax Bureau to carefully examine various account books when stamp inspection personnel go to stores for inspection. Account books that do not require stamps should not be taken to the court to avoid innocent people being implicated. The association sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance on the 11th of last month, requesting that the competent authorities be ordered to handle the matter in accordance with the law and not to act rashly, so as to avoid causing trouble to businesses. The association received a reply from the Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance yesterday. The original letter is as follows: It is hereby informed that the Ministry of Finance has issued a telegram from your association on April, stating that the stamp tax inspectors of the Cigarette Investigation Office arbitrarily searched the account books of the Zhongfa Pharmacy, and their actions were excessive, which is inconsistent with Articles 4 and 7 of the Stamp Tax Inspection Regulations. Please order the competent authorities to handle the matter in accordance with the law and not to act rashly, so as to avoid causing trouble to businesses. Upon investigation of the Stamp Tax Inspection Regulations, although the local Shanghai Special Zone has separate regulations and cannot be applied, it is a discipline that inspectors should abide by not to act rashly when performing their duties. Last year, the Shanghai Biscuit, Candy, and Canned Food Industry Association submitted a report stating that the inspectors of the Special Zone went to Taikang Company for inspection and arbitrarily harassed them. When the office received the report, it ordered the Shanghai Concession Cigarette Investigation Office to investigate the facts and inform the investigation personnel under its jurisdiction to be careful and not to engage in any harassment. In addition to ordering the office to strictly correct the matter again, this letter is sent to inform you for your reference.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Held a Meeting of the Industrial and Commercial Laws and Regulations Research Committee Yesterday</h3>
<p>Discussing the Draft Bankruptcy Law</p>
<p>The Industrial and Commercial Laws and Regulations Research Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce held its fourth plenary committee meeting in the meeting room of the Chamber of Commerce yesterday. More than ten committee members attended, including Guo Shouyi, Wang Xiaotong, 　Xu Lun, Xu Yongzuo, Xi Yushu, Jiang Wanping, Xie Chunpu, Li Wenjie, Yu Chengxiu, Wang Xiaowen, and Sun Xiaolou. Li Wenjie was elected as chairman, and Xi Yushu recorded the minutes.

It was generally agreed that there were no inconsistencies. The five points of opinions proposed by the Standing Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the draft bankruptcy law, and the opinions submitted by Committee Members Fang Jiaobo and Lu Jun were studied. Pan Xulun, Wang Xiaotong, Guo Shouyi, Xi Yushu, Jiang Wanping, Xu Yongzuo, and others expressed many opinions. The attending committee members discussed in detail for three hours. Finally, it was decided that the Standing Committee would compile all the arguments into a written opinion and send it to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for submission to the Civil Law Committee of the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<h3>British Ship "Kent" Breaks Giant Chain of Pontoon</h3>
<p>The British cruiser Kent recently sailed on the Huangpu River, intending to dock at the British naval pontoon near the Bund of Edward Road, so that it could light up with a big burning electric light at night on the 25th anniversary celebration day of the British Royal 御　on the sixth of this month, and shoot searchlights in all directions to enhance the gathering. Unexpectedly, just after passing the Suzhou River, the tide was rapid and the wind was tight, causing the crowd to approach Shanghai and break the giant chain of the pontoon where it was to dock. The ship then moved to the Blue Funnel Line wharf on the Pudong side. Under the pontoon, there is an eight-ton iron 鐙, which is sunk at the bottom of the river, which is twenty-two feet deep, and covered with thick mud, so it is strong and can hit a giant ship. Now, a dredger needs to dig up the mud and then lift the iron 鐙 out of the water, connect the broken chain, and sink it back to the bottom of the river, covered with thick mud, so that it can hit and dock the giant ship. It is estimated that the project will take a month, so the British ship Kent may not be able to carry out its celebration arrangements at the original place on the celebration day.</p>
<h3>Postal Savings Bureau Actively Prepares for Simple Life Insurance</h3>
<p>Since the Legislative Yuan passed the Postal Simple Life Insurance Law at the end of last month, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation has been working very hard on the preparations in the Insurance Department because this project was originally proposed and initiated by the bureau. Moreover, since the simple life insurance methods largely draw from Japan, most of the materials are Japanese publications. Therefore, the bureau has specially added three Japanese translators to be responsible for translation work. Zhang Mingxin, deputy director of the Insurance Department, is directing everything, and the situation is very tense. The bureau has recently expanded the adjacent rooms into the office because the number of people is large and the rooms are small, which is insufficient for office work. Although the establishment is set for July 1, the official opening may still be awaited. Simple life insurance is very developed in various countries, especially in Japan. Our 　　is the first to create it, but considering the situation in our country, the vast majority of common people have no guarantee of life. Once they die, the hardship of their families is even more unspeakable. Since simple life insurance is operated by the government, the only purpose is to seek the happiness of the public, which cannot be compared with those who specialize in making profits. However, this matter is of great importance, and it is hoped that all sectors will pay attention to it and study it together, in order to stabilize the people's livelihood.</p>

<h3>Pre-Announcement of the Opening of "Small" Insurance</h3>
<p>The United States Life Insurance Company of Shanghai Hankou Beach, a legally registered life insurance company with a reserve system registered by the US Delaware government, has been operating in Shanghai for 14 years. Its capital is strong and its business is developed. Recently, due to social needs for "small" insurance, it specially sent Ren Zuojun, manager of the business department, to Europe and the United States for investigation last year. Mr. Ren has returned from his investigation. The company has set up a branch company at 666 Huade Road, with Ren Zuojun as the manager, specializing in weekly savings insurance (ie, employee insurance in Europe and the United States). All scattered savings and small insurance are accepted uniformly, and a large number of agents are set up to collect premiums from policyholders' addresses every week. It is very thoughtful for the convenience of policyholders. According to what Mr. Ren said to people, weekly savings insurance is still a pioneering work in China. The premium starts from five cents per week, and shop employees and workers can insure. It is expected that the company has been renovated and will open on the 6th. However, since May 1, no less than hundreds of people have requested insurance regulations every day. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at the opening.</p>
<h3>Two Factions of Small Workers in Xiaoshadu Beat Fiercely for Supporting Foremen</h3>
<p>Thirty-four people were arrested.</p>
<p>At about 11:00 PM the night before, the Xinzha Branch of the Zhabei Public Security Bureau, according to patrol officer Li Qingjie of the Tanziwan Police Station, sent police officers Yuan Yao, Lu Wenxing, and Quan Daoren to escort the thirty-four defendants, including Zhong Guixin, who were brought in from Fuxin Warehouse in Xiaoshadu, for fighting in public to support the foreman, causing injuries to both sides, with broken heads and bleeding. Please investigate and verify. After questioning by Bureau Officer Ouyang Liu, Zhong Guixin confessed that Wang Jinfu is the foreman in our factory. We have thirty small workers who deposit a portion of their monthly wages in his hands, totaling 300 yuan. Now we want to take this money back, but Wang Jinfu refuses, which led to the fight. Yang Jirong, Gao Bilou, Zhu Zineng, Zhang Baogui, Wang Shuyuan, Gao Jinsheng, Cao Changmao, and other seven people confessed to the same facts. Han Zaifa, Liu Shunan, Cao Si, Zhai Baogen, Chen Zhengjun, Han Yinzhi, Zhong Si, Gu Wenshan, Zhao Tianqiao, Zhang Xueyuan, Zhang Rongju, Wang Xiaolin, and other twelve people confessed that they did not help the Zhong surname fight, but just watched them from the side. According to Huang Defu, he has no grievances with the Zhong surname. Because they wanted to overthrow Wang Jinfu as the foreman and support Han Zaifa as the foreman, I thought that Wang's brain was an old man who had been around for many years and treated us very well, so I couldn't bear to see him go far away. The Zhong surname and others thought that they could not overthrow Wang Jinfu, so they considered it a failure, gathered many people, and used iron and wooden sticks, axes, and other weapons to fight. When the police arrived, they had already hidden the weapons and broke their own heads, falsely accusing us of hitting them. Please investigate. He Defa, Zhou Songlan, Hu Changlin, Shan Zaimi, Yin Wenlin, Xu Fanghai, Lu Yuanqing, Ju Guanghe, Li San, Liu Yushan, Wang Rongxiang, Du Wenmei, Cao Liren, and other thirteen people confessed similarly to Huang Defu. After the interrogator verified the confession, he decided to send the case involving injuries to the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau for transfer to the Shanghai District Court for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Dissolute Business Music: Three Bureaus Jointly Prohibit It</h3>
<p>Playing Mournful Music at Celebrations is Absurd; Funerals Play Popular Tunes Instead</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Safety Bureau, Education Bureau, and Social Bureau of this city jointly issued a public notice yesterday, stating, "Based on the instructions from the Municipal Government, it was found that the laboring music bands in this city not only have bizarre costumes but also play inappropriate music. Sometimes, mournful music or foreign national anthems are played at celebrations and banquets, while popular tunes are played at funerals. This is absurd and ridiculous, making us a laughingstock at home and abroad. The government has ordered the relevant bureaus to formulate and implement registration measures for these music bands. However, it has been found that while a few have complied and improved, many still do not research and continue with these practices. Recently, some funeral cars have even installed radios and play songs at will along the way, which is even more unacceptable. In addition to separately ordering the Public Safety Bureau and the Education Bureau to strictly prohibit these practices, it is ordered that these bureaus immediately comply and strictly prohibit these practices to promote solemnity and improve customs." Based on this, in addition to ordering the subordinate Public Safety Bureau to strictly prohibit these practices, we are jointly issuing this public notice to inform all business music bands and funeral car rental businesses in this city to strictly comply. Sincerely, this notice.</p>
<h3>### A Husband Murdered by His Lover and Adulteress - The Criminals Arrested</h3>
<p>Yu Xinming, from Ning, only eighteen years old, lived in his ancestral home outside the South Gate and made a living by farming. He married Jia, who is seventeen years old. On the night of the ninth day of the sixth lunar month, Yu Xinming was somehow brutally murdered by his wife Jia, her mother Jia Fu, and Jia Fu's lover, Yu Hengning, who strangled him with a rope. Then, they stabbed him three times in the chest. Such cruel means are chilling. The criminals then fled without a trace. It was not until the next day that the family discovered the crime and reported it to the Funing County Government, which sent personnel to verify the death and prepare the coffin, awaiting the arrest of the criminals. It has been learned that this case has been outstanding for ten months since the incident, and the criminals are still at large. The deceased's elder sister, Yang Yu, learned from Funing that the criminals were hiding in Shanghai and that her brother's wife, Jia, had remarried. Yang Yu was deeply saddened by her brother's tragic death at the hands of his wife and others and felt that the injustice had not been redressed. Moved by the deep bond between siblings, she came to Shanghai last month and stayed temporarily with relatives near the Sun Temple. She searched for days and finally, the day before yesterday, she learned that the criminals, including Yu Hengshan, were hiding in a shed near the North Shanghai Dayang Bridge (Yu made a living by pulling a rickshaw). Yang Yu secretly reported this to the New Zhabei Police Station, which immediately ordered the head patrolman to proceed quietly to arrest them. Yu Hengshan, Jia Fu, and Yu Jia, three male and female criminals, were all arrested and taken to the station. Yesterday, they were transferred to the local court for interrogation. After a preliminary interrogation by the prosecutor, the criminals were ordered to be detained separately, pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>### Young Woman Commits Suicide by Poison</h3>
<p>Her Husband Was Unaware When She Left Home; Why She Committed Suicide is a Mystery</p>
<p>At around 11 PM the night before last, a young woman, dressed in a gray cloth cheongsam, leather shoes, and jade-colored silk stockings, speaking with a local accent, came to the Eastern Hotel on Xizang Road and checked in. The receptionist led her to room 603 on the sixth floor. She gave her name as Wang Huimin, 20 years old. Shortly after, she went out, but soon returned, closed the door, and went to sleep. At around 7 AM yesterday morning, the hotel tea server knocked on the door to ask if she needed to extend her stay. When there was no response for a long time, he found a way to open the door and enter. He found the young woman lying stiff in bed, on the verge of death. Alarmed, he immediately reported this to the hotel, which sent a car to take her to the hospital for treatment. However, she had taken too much poison and could not be saved. She soon died. A fountain pen and a gold ring with her name engraved in English were found on her person. After investigation, it was discovered that her real name was Zhao Peiying, 19 years old, and she lived on Broadway in Hongkou. Her husband is a dentist. She did not inform her family when she left home the night before last. The reason for her suicide is unknown. The body has been claimed by her husband, who was notified by the hotel to identify the body and arrange the funeral.</p>
<h3>### Strange Tea Table in an Opium Den</h3>
<p>The Tabletop Opens Upwards, and Inside Are All Opium Paraphernalia</p>
<p>Chief Patrolman Lu Dagong and Detectives Wang Bocheng and Chen Yaoting of the General Patrol discovered that someone was secretly running an opium den in room 23 of the Jiangxin Hotel at No. 40 Shanxi Road. The furnishings were quite luxurious, and the organization was very strict. Therefore, they rented room 25 in the hotel on the first and second of this month to investigate their activities. After discovering that the opium den was indeed run by Jin Yingsun, the Zhejiang owner of the Jiangxin Hotel, they requested a search warrant from the First Special District Court. At 10:30 PM the night before last, they secretly went to arrest them. They arrested Jin, his common-law wife Jin Xu, and opium smokers Ding Tongsheng and Chen Hongyuan in the room. They seized two opium pipes, one opium lamp, ten large bags of opium, and one jar of opium. One of the opium pipes was made of jade. At that time, Chief Patrolman Lu and others found a strange tea table in the corner. After looking all over it without finding a drawer, they discovered that it was hollow inside. By lifting the tabletop upwards, all the opium paraphernalia were revealed. They brought everything back to the station and detained them separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Branch of the First Special District Court, and the patrol's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, filed charges against them according to Articles 10 and 11 of the Anti-Opium Law. After a brief interrogation by Judge Feng Shide, Jin Xu claimed to be the wife of Ding Tongsheng. However, the patrolmen confirmed that she was indeed Jin Yingsun's wife. The court then sentenced Jin Yingsun to nine months in prison and a fine of 100 yuan. Ding Tongsheng and Jin Xu were each fined 20 yuan, and Chen Hongyuan was found not guilty. All opium paraphernalia were confiscated.</p>
<h3>### Ministry of Railways Rewards Fenghua Needle Factory</h3>

<h3>### Inheritance Lawsuit of Late Shanghai Merchant Shen Xingshan</h3>
<p>Rescheduled for May 17</p>
<p>The late former Chief of Anti-Smuggling Camp and Haimen native, Shen Xingshan (also known as Ru Lin), built his Zhenping Estate on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. He had a son named Yaocheng. In the late Qing Dynasty, Shen Xingshan cohabitated with a woman named Shen Hanying. On January 17, 1932, Xingshan committed suicide by poison due to debts amounting to more than 163,000 yuan. Shen's son, Yaocheng, negotiated with Hanying regarding his father's estate. While relatives and friends were mediating, Yaocheng suddenly hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court, requesting confirmation of his identity and the return of the inheritance. The court issued a notice, and Judge Li Liang presided over the hearing in the Civil Court No. 7 yesterday. The defendants did not appear in court and were represented by lawyers. The plaintiff's lawyer first stated the purpose of the lawsuit, stating that Shen Yaocheng, 35 years old, from Haimen, lives at No. 19 Zhenping Lane, Avenue Joffre. Shen Hanying lives at No. 19 Minguo Lane, Minguo Road. The defendant cohabitated with the plaintiff's father. After the plaintiff's father, Shen Xingshan, died, all of the estate was in the possession of the defendant. Now, the plaintiff requests confirmation of Shen Yaocheng as Xingshan's heir and the return of 97,975 yuan, 8 jiao, and 0.4 li, as well as the receipts for all property rights and income from Xingshan's estate, from January 17, 1932, to January 16, 1935, totaling 36 months, 15,348 yuan, 4 jiao, 5 fen, and 6 li. The plaintiff is also requesting the return of 7,600 yuan from the auction of movable property, furniture, trucks, and rent from Zhenping Lane. Xingshan originally lived at Nos. 18 and 19 Zhenping Lane. After Xingshan's death on January 17, 1932, the movable and immovable property was estimated to be worth about 100,000 yuan. When the inheritance began, the plaintiff's mother, Fan, had already died. Xingshan's direct bloodline only included the plaintiff. According to the law, the plaintiff is naturally Xingshan's sole heir. Therefore, the lawsuit was filed according to the law, etc. The defendant's defense lawyer then argued that Xingshan's debts exceeded his assets. After reviewing the evidence, Judge Li Liang announced that the case would be rescheduled for further hearing at 10 AM on May 17.</p>

<h3>### Shanghai Bank Deputy Manager Yang Dunfu Dies</h3>
<p>Shanghai Bank Deputy Manager Yang Dunfu suddenly passed away at the Shanghai Sanatorium at 4:15 AM on May 4 at the age of 54. Friends at home and abroad deeply mourned his death, believing that it was a loss of talent, not only a misfortune for the Shanghai Bank but also a loss for society. Yang was from Jiangning. He graduated from Wuchang Wenhua School in his early years and worked in the Postal Bureau. He then worked as the chief translator at the Shanghai Sanxin Textile Company for many years. After the Republic of China was established, he studied banking and worked at the Jiangsu Bank founded by Chen Guangfu. He then served as the manager of the Wuxi branch of the Bank of China. In 1915, Chen Guangfu founded the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, and Yang served as Deputy Manager for 20 years. His contributions were great. Unfortunately, he went to Beijing to recuperate due to high blood pressure last year for five months. This year, his old illness recurred, and he was hospitalized for more than a month. He then returned to his residence in Qishan Village, Yu Garden Road, to recuperate. On May 2, he was admitted to the Shanghai Sanatorium temporarily.

<h3>### The West Gate Women and Children's Hospital Celebrates Its 50th Anniversary</h3>
<p>The West Gate Women and Children's Hospital has been established for 50 years. The operators have worked hard and made many improvements, achieving what it is today, which is admirable. On the occasion of this anniversary, the details of the hospital are described below.</p>
<p>The founder of the hospital was Ms. McGrille Wickinson, who lived frugally and selflessly. She was generous to those in need. In 1882, Ms. Wickinson became a founding member of the Missionary Association and donated 5,000 yuan to establish a women and children's hospital. Unfortunately, she passed away the following year. She still thought of the hospital when she was dying. Later generations believed that Ms. Wickinson's contributions were immeasurable, so they named the hospital after her.</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the hospital has been operating diligently. The buildings have been built gradually, resulting in today's scale. The current buildings are divided into three parts. One part is the Shanghai Women's Medical College and the Concord Nursing School, with an outpatient department on the ground floor. One part is the newly built obstetrics department, with the latest equipment. The third part is the internal medicine and surgery department, which is grand in scale and the largest women's hospital in China.</p>
<p>The outpatient department was established in 1883 and provides daily consultations. Over the years, the department has been divided into internal medicine, surgery, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, and has successively established pediatrics, tuberculosis, dermatology, venereology, prenatal care, infant care, and vaccination departments. Since 1885, it has treated more than 1.5 million patients, and its service to society can be imagined.</p>
<p>The hospital's obstetrics department is the most famous. It was rebuilt in 1931 and can accommodate 100 maternity patients and infants. A total of 40,000 infants have been born in the hospital, with more than 1,000 births per year.</p>
<p>The hospital established the Shanghai Women's Medical College in 1924 to cultivate talent. It hired many teachers and provided strict training. The school is registered in Columbia, USA, and is legally authorized to grant doctoral degrees in medicine. The Concord Nursing School, established in 1921, specializes in training nurses and is also very developed.</p>
<p>The hospital also has a public health department to provide continuous service to patients who have been hospitalized and treated in the clinic. It was established in 1927 and has achieved remarkable results after seven years of effort, providing convenience to patients. The hospital plans to gradually rebuild new buildings due to the outdated and unsuitable old buildings. The required funds are estimated to be 200,000 yuan. The hospital authorities hope that all sectors of society will donate generously so that it can be realized as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The hospital's establishment is completely charitable. It provides many subsidies and meticulous treatment to the poor and sick. The hospital spends 2.5 yuan for each patient who pays 5 jiao per day. The hospital's funding comes from three sources: the regular expenses remitted from the United States, and external donations to make up for the shortfall. Since this year, income has decreased sharply, and the regular expenses from the United States are also limited. Therefore, it has to rely on donations from all sectors of society. If 100 people each donate 100 yuan, the hospital's funding shortage can be made up. Therefore, on the occasion of its 50th anniversary, the hospital hopes that people from all walks of life will recognize its 50 years of hard work and dedication to society and donate generously to cultivate this emerging institution and enable it to develop rapidly and gradually realize its current plan, so that it can provide more services in the future.</p>
<h3>### Dr. Yen Fuqing's Agency at the Hongqiao Sanatorium Sees a Surge in Consultations</h3>
<p>Liu Ruiheng and Wang Shijie Visit; Writer Sun Deqian Writes in Praise</p>
<p>The Hongqiao Sanatorium in Western Shanghai has beautiful architecture, a quiet environment, complete facilities, and ample sunlight and air. The exquisite taste of Chinese and Western meals are its characteristics. Since Dr. Yen Fuqing took over as director, he has spared no effort in improving the hospital's affairs. The consultations have become increasingly developed, and the number of inpatients has increased daily. The doctors and the X-ray department are quite busy. The hospital has also reduced its fees as the number of inpatients has increased in order to implement the purpose of serving society. Director of the Department of Health Liu Ruiheng and Minister of Education Wang Shijie visited the hospital, where they were received by Yen, who took them on a tour. Both praised the hospital highly. Writer Sun Deqian also recently wrote in praise, saying, "The Hongqiao Sanatorium is far from the city and is located in the suburbs, away from the dust. It has a clear and empty atmosphere and is full of wildness. The scenery is excellent. It is a natural and excellent area for health preservation. It has a grand scale, complete facilities, clean meals, high and bright courtyards, carefully selected medicines, famous doctors providing regular diagnosis and treatment, and nurses providing diligent service in three shifts day and night. The director visits every day and strictly supervises. Patients feel as comfortable as they are at home. The hospital was founded by Mr. Ding Zhongyou, and his spirit of serving society is admirable."</p>

<h3>The Case of Sheng Yuchang Being Accused by His Concubine Concludes; Sheng's Concubine Is Seriously Ill and Supported to Court by a Maidservant</h3>
<p>Lin Yujin, a 27-year-old woman from Guangdong, worked as a prostitute in a brothel in Guangdong in her early years. At the age of 16, she was introduced by Su Shichi and married Sheng Yuchang (38 years old this year, residing at No. 1, Jiabei Chang Road), the eldest grandson of the late Qing Dynasty official Sheng Xingsun from Wujin, as his concubine. In 1925, at the age of 19, she was forced out of the house due to the squabbles with Sheng's other concubines. After leaving, she faced hardship and became a dancer in the Great Shanghai Ballroom. After the January 28th Incident, Sheng went to the Great Shanghai Ballroom to dance and rekindled his old feelings with Lin. Sheng provided her with money to reunite and rented No. 191, Xiafei Road (the building above the Jinhua Pharmacy at the west end of Renhe Lane, near the intersection of Beile Road). Sheng paid her living expenses monthly and frequently visited her. However, starting in April of that year, Sheng suddenly</p>
<p>disappeared and stopped providing her with daily expenses.</p>
<p>Lin also suffered from lung disease and repeatedly sought Sheng, but was unable to see him. She resented Sheng's erratic behavior and hired lawyer Hua Maosheng to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing Sheng Yuchang of abandonment and requesting a trial according to the law, along with a civil lawsuit. The court accepted the lawsuit and on January 12th of this year, Judge Zhang Chaozuo held a hearing, summoning both parties to investigate the matter. The defendant denied the meeting at the ballroom and cohabitation after the separation. The plaintiff presented evidence from the second landlord, Chen Zhangshi, and Cao Fusheng, who lived with them, to testify. The court adjourned the hearing and instructed both parties</p>
<p>to reconcile privately.</p>
<p>The details have been reported in this newspaper the next day. The plaintiff, Lin Yujin's lung disease has worsened and she also suffers from heart disease. Unable to afford treatment, she was introduced to the Sino-German Hospital for free treatment. This case was resumed yesterday by Judge Zhang. Both parties and their lawyers were present, but the plaintiff was mentally exhausted due to illness. She was supported to court by her former maid Wang Aibao, and was questioned while seated. According to the plaintiff, she married the defendant at the age of 16 and was forced to leave in 1925, at the age of 19, when the defendant wrote an agreement forcing her to sign. After leaving, she borrowed money from her female friends to survive and had no choice but to enter the</p>
<p>Great Shanghai Ballroom</p>
<p>as a dancer. After the January 28th Incident, the defendant went to the Great Shanghai Ballroom with a woman to dance and met her. The defendant ordered the woman who accompanied him to give her 200 yuan. The second time the defendant came, she spoke to him, begging him to have pity on her and take care of her difficult situation. The defendant agreed to rent a house together and provide her with living expenses. They then went together to rent No. 191, Xiafei Road. He promised to restore their old relationship and cancel the previous agreement, asking her to live there temporarily before taking her back to his residence. However, starting in April of last year, seeing that she was seriously ill, he disappeared without a trace, abandoning her. She requested that he be punished according to the law. Her lawyer stated to the court that she was withdrawing the civil lawsuit. The defendant admitted to</p>
<p>marrying the plaintiff</p>
<p>as his concubine, spending 3,000 yuan at the time. In 1925, she voluntarily left without conditions. After the January 28th Incident, the situation outside was bad and he stayed at home, never going to the ballroom. He was asked, "How many women do you have living together?" He replied, "I have three women living separately." He was asked, "Last time you were instructed to reconcile privately." He replied, "After the last hearing, I received threatening phone calls, and my lawyer also received threatening letters, so it was impossible to reconcile." He was asked, "The plaintiff is now in such a state of illness, can you help her morally?" He replied, "She has done things that are detrimental to me and threatening, so I</p>
<p>do not want to help."</p>
<p>The maid Wang Aibao, who supported the plaintiff, testified that she helped at the plaintiff's place, and the defendant used to come often before April of last year, but stopped coming after April. Once, he asked her to buy "Snow Mustard" cigarettes, and when she bought the wrong brand, he scolded her. At this point, the court ordered closing arguments. The plaintiff's lawyer, Hua Maosheng, argued that since the defendant had restored the plaintiff's former status and cohabited with her, the plaintiff's status as his concubine remained. However, the defendant, seeing that the plaintiff was so seriously ill, abandoned her completely. If others saw the plaintiff so ill, helpless and without support, they should help and provide relief morally and humanely, let alone the defendant. Therefore, the defendant should be held criminally responsible and be punished according to Article 310, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law for abandonment. After the defendant's lawyer defended him, the court announced the conclusion and scheduled the verdict in eight days, then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Alumni in Japan Welcome President Kinoshita of Meiji University</h3>
<p>Kinoshita Tomosaburo, the president of Meiji University in Japan, visited China this time and was warmly welcomed by various parties. On the 3rd, at the invitation of famous universities, he, along with Professor Shida Kotaro of the Faculty of Commerce, Marquis Matsudaira Yasumasa, and Kinoshita Kenji, gave lectures at the universities. At 7 p.m., the Meiji University Alumni Association held a welcome reception at the Datong Jiulou Restaurant to fulfill the friendship between teachers and students. More than 40 alumni attended, including Hu Zang, Chen Jinrong, Chen Peide, Shi Zhuoren, Liang Ruojie, Mei Qingshan, Jiang Pan, Yang Bilang, Wen Zong'e, Yang Guoshu, Jiang Zongpan, Shen Qichang, Jin Yu, Jiang Zhenshan, Li Zhaofu, Su Liban, and Liang Fuchu. Liang Fuchu delivered a welcoming speech, followed by President Yamamoto's address, which stated that he was happy to accept the invitation and travel across the ocean to meet with them. Some of the alumni had returned to China from their alma mater more than 30 years ago, while others were recent graduates. Although their times varied, they were all able to use their knowledge to contribute to the improvement of the Republic of China, which he was pleased to hear. He had heard that the alumni lacked unity and that those in higher positions were arrogant and did not consider themselves Meiji University alumni. This situation was deeply regrettable. He emphasized that all those who came from Meiji University should connect with each other. After the speech, they took a group photo and dispersed. It is said that Dr. Kinoshita went to Beijing yesterday. In addition to visiting the Mausoleum of President Sun Yat-sen and presenting a wreath, he plans to meet with President Wang Jingwei. Many important figures in the central government in Beijing are from Meiji University and are also preparing to hold a welcome reception. He is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 7th and go to Hangzhou on the 8th. If the alumni in Hangzhou have any matters to discuss, they can contact Hu Yizang at No. 95, Sida Lane, Shigaota Road, Shanghai.</p>

<h3>New Information from the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Association: Essential Living Needs Are Being Met; Branch Construction Is Imminent</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Association in Shanghai has been actively involved in work patrols for about half a year. The Executive Director, Zhang Dengying, arrives at the association every day to handle all matters, both large and small, with great enthusiasm. As a result, a large number of rickshaw pullers, averaging more than 1,500 or 1,600 people, come to the association every day to enjoy various facilities. Future developments can be predicted. The association's recent arrangements for the living needs of rickshaw pullers are summarized below:</p>
<p>"Food"</p>
<p>Establishment of a public canteen, operated entirely according to the "Mutual Aid Hospitality" method. Meal tickets are divided into three types: 15, 30, and 1 yuan. Ticket holders can purchase food and choose any dish, striving for nutrition and hygiene at affordable prices. The daily cost of food is offset by the revenue from meal tickets. If there is a surplus, the meals will be increased the next day to compensate. If there is a deficit, the meals will be reduced the next day to cover the loss. Accounts are open to the public and the method is serious. Wages and all operating expenses are paid entirely by the association. Therefore, the canteen is bustling with people, and everyone is satisfied.</p>
<p>"Clothing"</p>
<p>At a time when all industries are in decline, ordinary rickshaw pullers can't even get enough to eat, let alone afford new clothes. Therefore, most of them are dressed in rags. Although the association is trying to provide relief, its resources are limited and cannot reach everyone. Most recently, the association's relief department sent letters to all sectors of society, requesting donations of clothing and shoes and socks, both new and old, regardless of size or quality, to benefit the rickshaw pullers.</p>
<p>"Housing"</p>
<p>Establishment of a dormitory, clean and hygienic, equipped with iron beds and cotton quilts. The daily cost of lodging is an average of 5 copper coins, and staff are assigned to manage it. Recently, nearly 200 people have been lodging there every day. The association will use 16,000 square feet of the flat roof on the third floor to build a wooden shed as a summer dormitory and recreation ground. This measure will greatly benefit the mental well-being of hardworking rickshaw pullers.</p>
<p>Other activities such as mobile clinics for rickshaw pullers' families, distribution of rice and financial assistance by the relief department, sanitation, health, and hygiene campaigns and living condition surveys by the social education department, as well as children's schools, adult schools, clinics, tea rooms, libraries, and bathhouses, have all achieved significant results. It is also reported that the association's board of directors has decided to prepare to build a branch association in the Kangti Road area of Nanshi to benefit rickshaw pullers living in Nanshi. The existing branch association in Tailai Lane in West Shanghai is a temporary measure and will soon need to be expanded to achieve greater work efficiency and promote the development of the association's affairs.</p>

<h3>A Conflict Occurred Among Porters at the North Station Yesterday Morning; Unofficial Porter Injures Foreman; Culprit Arrested and Injured Person Sent to Hospital</h3>
<p>At the Shanghai Jinghu Railway Station, a large number of porters are employed to facilitate passengers and speed up the loading of goods. The porters are managed by several foremen, who in turn employ multiple porters, who are not directly under the stationmaster, commonly known as "unofficial workers." At 9:40 a.m. yesterday, more than 10 unofficial workers had a conflict with the foremen over the amount of porterage, resulting in a clash inside the station. They used loading hooks to stab the foreman, Gao Ge, from Gaoyou (45 years old), in the left and right temples and cheeks, with the hook tips penetrating about five or six centimeters, causing Gao to bleed profusely. This was noticed by the police officers of the 3rd Branch of the Su Song Police Department, who blew their whistles, causing the workers to disperse. However, the culprit, Li Guangjin (33 years old, from Qinghe), was unable to escape and was arrested and taken to the police station. After questioning by Director Zhong, it was decided to hand him over to the local court for legal proceedings. The injured person was sent to the Lianglu Hospital by the railway bureau for treatment.</p>
<h3>Kidnapper from Changzhou Arrested in Shanghai; Victim's Mother Suffers Wrongful Imprisonment; Truth Revealed After Drunken Confession</h3>
<p>Zhou Haotang, a 31-year-old man from Changzhou, conspired with others to kidnap and hide a child four years ago in his hometown. Later, due to lack of ransom, he killed the child. To avoid arrest he fled to Shanghai and hid at No. 41, Xiangyu Lane, Yuanfang Road, Hongkou. He is currently working as a worker at the Great China Machinery Well Drilling Company at the intersection of Lincoln Road, Daxilu, West Shanghai. His mother, Chen, has been imprisoned in the Changzhou District Court for four years because Haotang has not been arrested. The day before yesterday afternoon, Haotang and the foreman of the company, Wang Jiachen (37 years old, from Shanghai, residing at No. 4, Yongxing Lane, Avenue Edward VII), were drinking and talking at the construction site. Zhou became intoxicated and revealed the details of kidnapping a child and his mother's imprisonment in Changzhou four years ago. Wang Jiachen was shocked and feared that he would be implicated in the future. He secretly reported the matter to Inspector Li of the Daxilu branch police station. After receiving the report, Police Chief Cao Rongxiang and detective Wu Yihe, along with plainclothes police officers, quietly went to the address and arrested the kidnapper Zhou Haotang, taking him to the Xuhui Police Station. After questioning by Director Hong, the suspect tried to deny the charges. Later, Zhou's uncle, Zhou Yongming, was summoned to the station and confirmed the story, at which point Zhou Haotang confessed. The director, after obtaining the confession, believed that the case involved kidnapping and extortion, which was extremely illegal. Therefore, he prepared a document and handed him over to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Pedestrian Crushed to Death by Tram</h3>
<p>At around 10 p.m. last night, the rear car of tram number 165 on Jing'an Temple Road, Huangjiasha Road, crushed a pedestrian in the middle of the road, crushing their face and causing a bloody mess, killing them instantly. The Chinese police officer number 1196 from the Xinzha Police Station arrived, recorded the number, and transported the body to the Renji Hospital and then to the morgue for examination.</p>
<h3>Car Accident on the Way to Zhenru; Car Overturns into a Ditch and Passengers Injured</h3>
<p>Li Guoliang, 37 years old, who works for Yushun Company outside Xiaodongmen, borrowed a new racing car, number 5863, from a friend at around 3 p.m. yesterday. Li acted as the driver and drove four or five friends, including Yuan Guoliang, to Zhenru, West Shanghai, for fun. On the way, because Li was unfamiliar with driving skills, he accidentally overturned the car into a ditch next to the road. Everyone in the car fell into the river and suffered injuries to their heads and faces. They then called their fellow villagers to help lift the car out of the ditch. Fortunately, the machinery was not damaged, so they were able to drive it to Baolong Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Male Corpse on the Beach in Wusong</h3>
<p>At 6 a.m. yesterday, an unidentified male corpse was found on the beach of the Wusong Fort. He was wearing long clothes, and his clothes and shoes were wet. There were traces of blood on his head, but his body was not swollen, so it did not appear to be a drowning death. Therefore, it was very suspicious. The Chinese police officer from the Customs Water Patrol Tongfang discovered the body. As it was a murder case, he reported it to the police station, who dispatched detective Huang Songsheng to investigate. Seeing that there were no obvious injuries on the surface of the body, it was difficult to determine the cause of death. Therefore, he reported it to the local court before noon, requesting an examination. He also waited to find out who the corpse was and then investigate further.</p>
<h3>Feng Xiangbing and Zhou Jimin are Involved in the Robbery of the Bank of China; Public Security Bureau Requests Transfer</h3>

On April 3rd, Shang Wu, a detective from the police station, escorted the suspect Zhou Jimin to No. 172, Gulu Road, and recovered four Browning pistols, 216 bullets, five magazines, and jewelry such as gold rings, which were taken back to the police station. After interrogation and judgment, Feng Xiangbing, Zhou Jimin and the other two criminals were taken back to the local court for detention. It has now been determined by the Public Security Bureau that the criminal Dong Aping was a major criminal involved in the robbery of the Bank of China in Xiaodongmen in June 1931, and was wanted. It is necessary to interrogate him strictly. Therefore, squad leader Gu Liancheng, foreman Gao Wannian, and wanted officer Li Siquan were dispatched yesterday noon to report to the local court and request the transfer of Zhou Jimin and Feng Xiangbing for strict investigation. The prosecutor in charge of the case stated that the case of the two criminals, Zhou and Feng, had already been transferred to the Criminal Court and that no transfer could be made pending a public trial.</p>

<h3>Weather Forecast</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated: Shandong and its surrounding areas are cloudy, but the weather is still fine. The wind is coming from the northeast to the southeast. The middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River are sunny and warm, with occasional clouds and a light breeze from the southeast to the southwest. The area south of Ma'an Island is cloudy and sunny, with morning fog and a warm northeasterly wind. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 80.4 degrees and the lowest was 52.5 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 64.8 degrees and the lowest was 57.1 degrees.</p>
<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>Traffic Bank Business Report (7)</h3>
<p>According to the above table, the remittance outflow and the purchase of drafts this year have increased the most in the Shanghai area, accounting for approximately 3.09%. Other regions, such as Shandong, Zhejiang, Henan, Shaanxi, Fujian, and Guangdong, have also achieved good results. This is because the financial situation in the southern and northwestern regions has gradually become more active in the past six months, and the Bank has also paid great attention to establishing institutions in the southern and northwestern regions. Currently, the number of remittance locations throughout the country has reached more than 330, making remittance transfers more convenient. Therefore, the remittance item has made progress. As for the northern region, the financial situation is tight due to high water levels. In the areas outside the customs, the traffic with the areas inside the customs is blocked, and trade is hampered. Therefore, the remittance business in the Tianjin, Shenyang, and Harbin regions is somewhat inferior. This is due to the unfavorable environment and is a special local situation.</p>
<p>(4) Savings The total balance of savings deposits of the Bank in the thirteenth year was more than 30,028,000 yuan, which is an increase of more than 11,608,000 yuan compared with the twelfth year. Compared with the balance of 21,756,000 yuan in the twenty-first year, there was an increase of more than 10,331,000 yuan in the twenty-second year, and an increase of more than 16,440,000 yuan compared to the twenty-first year. The balance of current savings deposits was more than 8,272,000 yuan, which is an increase of more than 1,277,000 yuan compared to the twenty-second year, and an increase of more than 3,298,000 yuan compared to the twenty-first year. Observing the trend of increasing savings balances over the years, fixed deposits are much higher than current deposits, perhaps only one-tenth or one-twelfth of fixed deposits. This is not unrelated to the promulgation of the Savings Bank Law. Because the law stipulates that checks may not be used, except for ordinary current deposits that are received and paid based on vouchers, which are not restricted and can still be transacted as usual. All special current deposits that originally used checks should close old accounts and stop opening new accounts in accordance with the law. Therefore, there was only a net increase of more than 1,277,000 yuan. In the future, the Bank's efforts should focus on the fixed deposit item in order to comply with the purpose of promoting savings and to be in line with the government's good intentions. As for the use of savings, the principle of striving for stability is still the main focus. The total investment balance for the year, excluding the current deposit placement of funds, was more than 1.11 million yuan, which is an increase of more than 3.664 million yuan compared to the twenty-second year. Among them, investments in government bonds and treasury bills totaled more than 9,938,000 yuan, and the underwriting of deposit certificates, passbooks, securities, and real estate mortgages totaled more than 4,172,000 yuan. These are the larger items. (To be continued)</p>

Then, chaired by Dr. Chen Xuanshan, twelve points regarding the issue of shortening vacations and school years were proposed and discussed one by one. The debate was extremely fierce at the time, with supporters and opponents evenly divided. As a result, a conditional approval was given to this issue. Everyone believed that today's schools urgently need to improve efficiency, while shortening vacations and school years is a secondary issue. In the near future, it seems necessary to first focus on enriching teaching and utilizing vacations. It is also reported that the editorial department of the society has compiled a book on the "Issue of Shortening Vacations and School Years," which will be published soon.</p>

<h3>How to Be a Little Scientist?</h3>
<p>— Xiang Zi</p>
<p>Little friends! Do you like science? Do you admire the greatness of Newton and Edison? I think the ambitious little friends will answer me: "I like it, I admire it, and I want to be a little scientist too."</p>
<p>However, a craftsman must build a solid foundation before he can build a house. Then, he can put the house on it. Otherwise, the house will collapse and never succeed.</p>
<p>Therefore, to be a little scientist, you must first solidify the foundation of science. But what is the foundation of science? It is the subjects you learn in school: arithmetic, nature, and manual labor. The most important things in science are precision and accuracy, and even the slightest error is not allowed. Moreover, many theories are deduced from arithmetic, so science and arithmetic must complement each other. Without it, you cannot succeed. Nature includes animals, plants, minerals, and physics and chemistry. These are all objects of scientific research, especially the latter few, which are even more important because they are the main raw materials of the foundation. Manual labor helps you develop your thinking and cultivate practical habits. Science cannot do without "thinking" and "doing."</p>
<p>Now, you should pay attention to these items carefully in school. Then, the foundation for being a little scientist has been laid, and you are qualified to be a little scientist.</p>
<h3>The Clock Repairman Who Doesn't Want Wages</h3>
<p>— Shen Chengzhao</p>
<p>Dear little friends, no matter what kind of craftsman in the world, none of them don't want wages. However, Henry Ford, the American automobile king, worked as a clock repairman who didn't want money when he was young. Once, his father severely rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>"Henry, don't be so stupid. How can anyone be willing to do something without any reward?"</p>
<p>"Dad, I feel infinite joy in repairing clocks!" Henry replied.</p>
<p>Henry's father was very angry and finally confined him at home, not letting him go out. However, how could Henry abandon his beloved machinery? One night, when the whole family was asleep, he quietly climbed out of bed and went to repair clocks for people. He didn't return home until late at night.</p>
<p>Once, he went to repair a clock in a neighboring village. By the time he finished repairing the clock, it was already past 2 a.m. He hurried home, but it suddenly started raining heavily, and the water in the river rose to the bridge! Henry lost his footing and fell in. Fortunately, he struggled to get ashore, but his clothes were soaked. When he returned home, he was scolded by his father. From then on, he could no longer sneak out to repair clocks.</p>
<p>Dear little friends, no matter what skill you study, you must be very enthusiastic and work hard, and you must never have a mentality of wanting rewards. This is how Henry Ford studied science.</p>
<h3>Children's Military Song</h3>
<p>— Lu Eryu</p>
<p>I have a pair of hands,</p>
<p>I have hot blood flowing,</p>
<p>Look at me carrying a rifle,</p>
<p>Walking on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Who says I'm young,</p>
<p>My ambition is the same,</p>
<p>I want to kill ten thousand enemies,</p>
<p>And often use the enemy's head as a ping-pong ball.</p>
<p>Don't fear the mist!</p>
<p>Don't hear the sound of mourning!</p>
<p>Arise! Hundreds of millions of children soldiers</p>
<p>Let's raise the righteous flag of saving the country!</p>
<h3>Where Does Dust Come From?</h3>
<p>— He Gongchao</p>
<p>In a previous issue of this publication, there was an article about "dust," but it didn't seem to mention where dust comes from. Now I will talk about it:</p>
<p>Where in the world is there no dust? Most of these dusts are ejected from volcanoes: rocks on the mountains are eroded by wind and rain and will also turn into fine dust: in the sky, there are many meteorites every day, burning and turning into dust, falling to the ground like sprinkling salt, but our eyes can't see it: also, there is more dust in cities than in the countryside, because there are more chimneys in cities and fewer chimneys in the countryside, and chimneys are also places where dust is produced.</p>
<p>Dust does not have wings, but is blown by the wind to all parts of the world, so there is no place in the world without dust. Moreover, dust can also form large groups and fly. Do you not believe it? I will tell you a story:</p>
<p>It is said that at the beginning of the 20th century, a big wind occurred in North Africa, which blew 1.8 million tons of dust to Europe, spreading it throughout the European continent. Some dust flew as far as 2,500 miles away from its place of origin.</p>
<p>Then, is dust harmful to humans or beneficial to humans? Strangely, humans cannot do without dust. Too much dust in the air is harmful to health, which everyone knows. But we must also know that without dust, it would not rain. Why? Because when water vapor in the air turns into clouds, it all condenses around dust particles to form water droplets. If there is no dust, wouldn't it not condense into rain?</p>
<h3>The Source of Paper</h3>
<p>— Zhi Wan</p>
<p>One day, Bao Ge asked his father:</p>
<p>"Dad! I see many children carefully looking for something in the garbage heap every day?"</p>
<p>"Child, they are looking for the raw materials for paper!"</p>
<p>"What, how can these dirty piles of rags make paper?"</p>
<p>"Yes, the clean white paper in your exercise book is made of the cloth scraps collected by one child after another. After they gather the rags together, they separate them into those that can be used to make good paper and those that can be used to make coarse paper. They are first thoroughly soaked and washed, then placed in a machine to make them into small pieces, and then ground into small pieces under a grindstone. Then they are placed in water to make them into a soup-like pulp."</p>
<p>Dad sipped his tea and continued.</p>
<p>"But this pulp is gray. To make it white, it must go through a bleaching process. Then, in another machine, the water in the pulp is filtered out through a sieve, and the rag soup becomes a felt-like thing. There is also a cylindrical press that flattens this felt, pressing it very thin. After it dries, it is polished by a machine, and it becomes beautiful paper."</p>
<p>Bin Ge finally understood how paper is made. He said to himself: "We must not forget the children who pick up rags!"</p>
<h3>Dialogue</h3>

<p>Mother: "Good child, who bullied you and made you cry?"</p>
<p>Child: "Brother broke my foreign doll."</p>
<p>Mother: "Oh! How naughty your brother is! How did he break it?"</p>
<p>Child: "I hit his head with the foreign doll, and his head broke my foreign doll."</p>
<p>Mother: "......"</p>
<h3>Children's Science Lecture on Fire</h3>
<p>— Lin Yin</p>
<p>There are many things that we cannot live without, and fire is one of them. Speaking of fire, it is really a wonderful thing. Everyone must be able to think of the uses of fire (Figure 1): Without fire at night, it is too dark to move. Without fire to cook, the rice is raw and cannot be eaten. Wet things can be dried by fire, and on cold days, fire can be used for warmth. If there were no fire, we might not be able to live!</p>
<p>The clever people of primitive times invented fire. Some struck stones to make fire, and some drilled wood to make fire (Figure 2). From our current point of view, they were so clumsy! Unlike us now, we can make fire with just a match (Figure 3). In fact, they are our benefactors! If they hadn't invented fire at that time, we probably wouldn't be able to use fire to increase the happiness in our lives!</p>
<p>Clever little friends may ask me: "How does fire come about?" Yes, this is an interesting question. I will simply answer: "When a substance combines with oxygen in the air and burns, it emits light and heat. This phenomenon is fire!" So fire will not burn without oxygen. Oxygen is like the life of fire. If you put a burning match into a glass that has been breathed into, the match will immediately go out (Figure 4) because the air breathed out of our mouths no longer has oxygen!</p>
<p>When a fire is burning, there must be flames. The temperature inside and outside the flames is completely different. The temperature near the outside of the flame is the highest because the air supply outside is sufficient. The temperature inside is lower because it is far from the air (Figure 5).</p>
<p>Fire is an indispensable thing in our lives, but we must be good at using it, and we must also be careful to prevent it. Otherwise, if we are not careful, when a fire occurs, it is dangerous if it burns clothes and objects, or even burns houses and injures people! (Figure 6)</p>
<h3>Playing Bubbles</h3>
<p>— Zhang Youjian</p>
<p>One. Fei'er and Rong'er went to the store to buy rubber bubbles. Rong'er bought a small one, but Fei'er wanted to buy the biggest one.</p>
<p>On the way, Fei'er saw Rong'er playing bubbles like himself, so he walked faster, wanting to make Rong'er panic and smash the bubbles.</p>
<p>Three. Unexpectedly, while thinking this, he was tripped by a stone under his feet and fell. His own big bubble broke.</p>
<h3>Little Sister Returns in Triumph</h3>
<p>— Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>A few days ago, the Jiangsu Provincial Anti-Smoking Committee specially held a Jiangsu Provincial Middle School Student Anti-Smoking Speech Competition to promote anti-smoking. Middle schools from all over Jiangsu sent representatives to participate.</p>
<p>In Class B of the third grade of junior high school at the Jiangsu Provincial Nanjing Women's Middle School, there is a Miss Zhang Shubao who is only fourteen years old this year. She is from Hunan, but she grew up in Beiping, so she speaks fluent Beiping dialect. This time, she was selected by the teachers and students of the entire school to participate in the Jiangsu Provincial Middle School Student Anti-Smoking Speech Competition. Among the several representatives from the province, she won first place with her correct posture, fluent Mandarin, and moving topic, and received more than a dozen prizes. Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Commission, who has worked hard and made great achievements, also awarded her a silver cup of "Well-Intentioned Words," and the Executive Committee and Supervisory Committee of the Central Party Department awarded her a silk flag of "Eradicating Evil Thoroughly." Little friends! Do you think this is a very honorable thing!</p>
<p>Among the dozens of representatives, Miss Zhang was the youngest, but she won first place. It can be seen that in anything, little friends are not weaker than big friends, so I hope little friends will not give up on themselves, thinking that I am still young!</p>
<h3>Animal Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>The tiger is shaped like a cat, with a golden body and thick black horizontal stripes. It is the most ferocious carnivore, likes to kill other beasts for food, and often bites and kills weak beasts even when its belly is full. The tiger's body is larger than the lion's, and its temperament is more fierce than the lion's. It often uses the protection of its fur color to hide in the thick grass and dense forests, waiting for other beasts. The male tiger's tail has no mane, and its head is rounder than the female's. The tiger produced in Bengal, India, has particularly beautiful fur color, while those produced in the three northeastern provinces and Korea are slightly white. Because it is convenient to walk in the snowy forest, it can withstand severe cold. In winter, its fur is tighter and longer. The tigers produced in Persia and the Malay Peninsula are slightly smaller in size, but very fierce. They usually hunt antelopes, wild boars, deer, etc. for food, and their appetite is very large. They can eat two fat cattle a week. If a wild buffalo is killed in the forest and it cannot finish eating it at one time, it will cover the remaining bones with grass leaves after eating to prevent it from being eaten by other beasts after going elsewhere. Its memory is very strong. When it is hungry, it still returns to the original place, so if hunters see a place with dead and残骸 remains, they can design to catch it. When tigers see humans, they will not harm them first. If humans suddenly startle them, then they will be harmed by them. Also, they will eat people when they are hungry. There are many methods for hunting tigers. Generally, the two methods of nets and traps are the most suitable. The trap method first digs a hole ten feet deep next to the forest, densely inserting sharp bamboo spears at the bottom of the hole, and covering the hole with grass leaves, the same as the grassland. When the tiger goes out to forage for food and sees someone coming, it quickly wants to escape to the grassland, so it falls into the hole. It usually comes out to forage for food before sunrise and at night after sunset, and rests in the cave during the day. A tiger can give birth to two or three cubs each time. When they are first born, their backs are bright yellow with black stripes, and their chest and jaw are pure white. The mother tiger is very affectionate to the cubs and teaches them all kinds of education, such as licking their feet to wash their faces and methods of catching birds and beasts, so small tigers captured from childhood can be raised and tamed at home, just like cats and dogs. The German Hagenbeck Circus, which performed in Shanghai the year before last, called Hagenbeck the father of fierce beasts. He once gave a tamed tiger to the American zoo. Two years later, he went to the zoo to play. The tiger suddenly saw Hagenbeck coming and immediately climbed onto the iron railing, as if with infinite sadness. This is a sign that fierce beasts do not forget old friendships.</p>
<h3>How to Make a Machine Gun</h3>
<p>— Kaili</p>
<p>Little friends! I know you love toys very much, so I came up with a simple and interesting way to make a machine gun. I will now use simple drawings and words to explain the content and structural sequence of this strange work.</p>
<p>Materials: one bamboo tube about half an inch in diameter, one old clock spring, one iron wire, and a little ordinary wood. Device: Cut the bamboo tube into three inches long, as shown in Figure (1). Insert a one-inch long steel bar into a wooden rotating shaft with a diameter of three minutes, as shown in Figure (2). Make a wooden pistol grip at will, making sure it fits your hand. Then take a piece of cylindrical wood, no more than three inches long, and hollow it out with a knife. Tie an iron wire about eight minutes from the bottom. Install the wooden handle, as shown in Figure (3). Take a few pieces of wood and cut them into more than a dozen wooden bullets seven minutes long and three minutes in diameter. The bullet head must be sharp, as shown in Figure (4). The device is shown in Figure (5).</p>
<p>Usage: First, put about five wooden bullets into the bullet loading port. Then, shake the wooden rotating shaft. The steel bar is prevented from moving forward by the iron wire, and the elastic force gradually increases. When it breaks free from the obstacle of the iron wire, it can hit the wooden bullet head hard. Therefore, the wooden bullet will fly out of the bamboo tube quickly. If the rotating shaft is constantly shaken, then the bullets can also fly out continuously.</p>
<h3>The Adventures of Sinbad the Sailor (16)</h3>
<p>— Xinqing</p>
<p>Within two or three days, a ship passed by. I immediately made a flag with the cloth of the headscarf to let the people on the ship know that I was asking for help.</p>
<p>Those people saw me and sent a small boat to take me on board. I did not tell them about being put into the tomb, but only told them that I had been washed ashore from a broken ship two days ago, but managed to save the gold and jewels I was carrying.</p>
<p>We set sail and arrived at Ganla Island, where we found good lead mines and many trees that produce camphor. The people living here are cannibals.</p>
<p>Finally, we returned to Baghdad, healthy and with abundant goods. In order to express my gratitude to God for protecting me, I spent money to give alms to the poor, and then spent my time in the joy of family life.</p>
<p>Sinbad's Fifth Voyage</p>
<p>But this kind of life felt too dull to me, so I decided to go out again. This time I built a ship for my own use and put all the goods I was carrying in the cabin. But there was still room in the ship, so I took a few people and their goods on board with me.</p>
<p>We set sail with a fair wind and soon arrived at a beautiful island. Some people ran ashore, where we found a Roc's egg, just as big as the one I had seen in the valley of gems. There was a small Roc in the egg, with its beak protruding from the shell.</p>
<p>Those who were with me saw this and took an axe to break the eggshell. Then they took out the small Roc and ate a meal. No matter what I said, they just did this thing; before they finished their feast, the sky gradually darkened, and in a place some distance away, we saw what we thought were two very large clouds.</p>
<p>The leader of my sailors knew what these two clouds were.</p>
<p>He shouted, "Quickly get on the ship! These dark clouds are the Rocs, male and female. If they see us, they will harm us."</p>
<p>We hurriedly got on the ship and set sail immediately; however, we were still too late. Those Rocs, seeing that their small Roc was dead, were sad and mad; they immediately flew away and grabbed large stones in their claws.</p>
<p>Then they flew above the ship, and we could see that their plan was to make the stones fall on the ship and sink us. One stone fell into the water and stirred up a large wave, but one hit the ship, only because the force was too great, it broke and sank immediately.</p>
<p>Those who were not killed when the big stone fell sank with the ship. This was my fate, but when I floated up again, I grabbed a piece of wood and clung to it to save my precious life. The wind and tide swept me forward, and finally threw me on the shore of an island.</p>

<h3>Dried Up Financial Market Chips; Easily Aroused Bidding Sentiment</h3>
<p>The market rose for most of the half-day session, but ultimately rebounded by $6.40.</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold market was characterized by a depletion of chips, easily aroused buying sentiment, and a lack of smooth flow of spot goods. Swap rates were unfavorable for sellers, large players went long, and sellers were inactive, creating a positive atmosphere. As a result, the market fell and then rose again. In the morning, overseas silver markets rose in unison, and big players predicted a very firm close, with prices higher than the closing price. The forward silver price in Montedeiro also rose by 1.5 to 2.3 fen. Exchange rates slightly contracted, and London spot gold fell by 4.5 pence. The over-the-counter preliminary trading opened at $80, but quickly fell to $74 due to eager sellers, before recovering slightly. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates were announced, with both British and American currencies rising, and the Customs Gold Unit falling by 2.4 li. The benchmark gold bidding price dropped to $828. The morning opening was also low, and the market was slightly weak after the opening. Banks rushed to buy at low prices, gradually driving the market up, which triggered buying sentiment. Slightly favorable news came from overseas, and the market became so dry that it broke through the $80 mark. It was predicted that the HSBC exchange rate would rise by 0.25 for British currency and $0.50 for American currency. The Central Bank also slightly released funds, which slightly suppressed the upward trend, but the market did not break below $80. Banks still had a healthy appetite, and buyers maintained their positions at low prices, keeping the market firm. However, there were many reversals in the middle, as the Central Bank took the opportunity to release funds at high prices. Nevertheless, the general sentiment was positive due to the favorable swap rates, and the market demand exceeded supply. Short sellers also came in to cover their positions. Although many longs took the opportunity to close their positions, there was still insufficient supply, and the market continued to rise. Foreign firms placed advance orders, twice approaching the $90 mark. Banks took the opportunity to release funds at high prices, but the foreign exchange market, although tight, did not show much strength.

With no transactions in the afternoon market, it returned to 834 yuan, so there was no change in the end. Only 4,000 jiao of transactions were made in the morning market. Guangdong small silver dollar fell by 0.5 jiao in the morning market to 733.8 yuan, and then fell by 0.6 jiao in the afternoon market to 712.3 yuan. In the end, it fell by 1.1 yuan compared to the previous day. 145,000 jiao of transactions were made in the morning market and 60,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins fell by another 1,000 cash compared to the previous day to 337,000 cash. The transaction amount was 30,330 strings of cash, equivalent to 9,000 foreign dollars. The total exchange amount at the local clearing house on the 4th was 7,523,200.089 silver dollars, including 3,442,757.47 silver dollars and 4,080,443.42 silver dollar transfers.</p>
<h3>Securities: 96 Bonds Rebound by 5 Jiao After a Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese securities market was very sluggish, and transactions were extremely thin. This is a common phenomenon every Saturday. However, the 96 public bonds actually began to rebound, as predicted by the reporter. Because sales stopped on the 4th, and there was some buying, and also on the 11th, there were more entries than exits, the difference between the recent highest and lowest prices has been as much as 4 yuan. The rebound should have been 8 jiao or 1 yuan higher, but yesterday's consecutive four-round increase was only about 0.5 yuan. The forward market was mostly equivalent to the current month, and it was ultimately unable to break through the 9 yuan mark. Because of too many rumors in recent days, counterfeit old tickets were enough to mislead. There was some caution in arbitrage transactions. Retail sales and the emergence of the Northern Gang's No. 14, etc., were quite enthusiastic, and the rising trend was frustrated. If the future situation cannot break through the 9 yuan mark, the rebound may return to within 8.5 yuan. In this case, the turbulent situation may not stop immediately, so the future is still uncertain. Other bond markets were increasingly sluggish, and remained in a trading range. Each round only fluctuated by 5 fen or 1 jiao. Only the first round of No. 48 increased for demobilization, which suddenly raised the price by 4 jiao, but public sentiment did not improve as a result. The market prices generally increased by 5 fen, 1 jiao, or 2 jiao. 96 bonds increased by 4 to 5 jiao. The total turnover was only 7,955,000 yuan, including 5,495,000 yuan of quick 96 bonds. The results of their increases and decreases are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3>Three Factors in the New York Stock Market</h3>
<p>Xin Feng foreign firm reported that yesterday's (3rd) New York stock market trended upward. One reason was the rebound in silver prices. The second reason was that the government did not allow the merger of Republic Steel Corporation and Corigan McKinley Steel Corporation. After Cleveland Federal Judge Rayman ruled the merger valid, it caused the market to rise. The third factor was a report from a subsidiary of American Telephone and Telegraph, stating that the number of users continued to increase. The bond market and the small exchange market also turned firm. The total turnover for the day was 950,000 shares. The Dow Jones indices are listed below.</p>
<p>Date | May 2 | May 3 | Change</p>

<h3>Yarn &amp; Cotton</h3>
<p>Slight Rebound in Yarn Market After Bidding</p>
<p>After a sharp drop in the yarn market the previous day, there was a slight rebound today. The situation in the market still feels sluggish. Because there is a lack of receivers this month, most people are inclined to sell. At the same time, spot yarn sales are very low. Total turnover for the day was only slightly less than 300 bales. In the afternoon, the three-ply yarn rebounded, and public sentiment was aroused.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Dafu Buys In</p>
<p>At the opening of the yarn bidding market, the momentum from the previous day had not subsided, and the selling pressure was particularly heavy. All months were sluggish. However, when the second and third rounds were auctioned, Rui Da and some profitable shorts covered their positions, and the market price became soft but firm. As a result, all months rose or fell by 1 to 2 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening rose slightly. Because Dongyang three-ply yarn rebounded, and Dafu came to buy 1,650 bales. However, Da Ji shorts increased their positions and sold 1,950 bales. The market price was calm. As a result, all months rose by 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 jiao compared to the morning closing price. The sales included Ji Feng 750 bales, Yu Da 650 bales, Gu Da 750 bales, Chang Feng 1,950 bales, Heng Chang 400 bales, Da Ji 1,950 bales, Jin Chang 600 bales, Da Chang Cheng 300 bales.

<h3>Cotton Bidding Reveals Uncertain State</h3>
<p>The cotton market is fluctuating again, but American cotton has risen by 10 points, Indian cotton has fallen by 1 rupee, and the bidding price has risen. The market is showing a weak but firm trend. However, most people think that the cotton price is falling step by step, the demand for spot cotton is decreasing, and the cotton market is small. Although there are 37,200 piculs of new cotton in storage in October, according to the survey, Western firms have sold short 20,000 piculs, and Japanese firms have also bought 20,000 piculs.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao's Difference is Minimal</p>
<p>At the opening of the cotton bidding market, the market condition was uncertain in all months, but public sentiment was still weak. However, American cotton rose by 13 points, Indian cotton fell by 1.2 rupees, and although silver rose by more than 100 points, the bidding price turned upward, so the new selling trend in the market was not strong, and the bulls remained calm and unmoved. As a result, all months rose by 0.05 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. At the opening of the afternoon market, the market suddenly rose sharply, and it was heard that the price of three-ply cotton rose by more than 1 yuan, and public sentiment was slightly higher. However, Yuan Yi sold a large amount, and the market price was suppressed by it. When the second and third rounds were auctioned, the price fell again. As a result, June and October each rose by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan, and the remaining months were unchanged. The sales included Mei Ji 2,100 piculs, Da Feng 700 piculs, Shen Chang 800 piculs, Yi Cheng 1,000 piculs, Run Kang 1,600 piculs, Sheng Yuan 1,200 piculs, Yi Feng 1,000 piculs, Chang He 1,500 piculs, Sui Long 900 piculs, Yuan Yi 5,100 piculs, and Da Chang Cheng 1,900 piculs. The purchases included Da Fu 2,500 piculs, Tong Ji 1,700 piculs, Yuan Da 1,700 piculs, Chang Feng 1,400 piculs, Xin Cheng 800 piculs, Da Chang 1,000 piculs, and Sheng Yuan 1,000 piculs. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows.</p>
<p>Month | High | Low | Close | Change | Stock</p>

<p>May | 33.35 | 33.25 | 33.3 | Down 0.05 | 140,300</p>

<h3>US Cotton Recovers by Over Ten Pounds</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton opened with a calm and firm market. Prices for all months rose by one to three pounds. Trading was moderate, mostly involving adjustments between July and October. Subsequently, silver prices strengthened, and the stock market showed vigor. Spot merchants bought in, and sellers were few, leading to a gradual price increase. On the export side, due to the scarcity of spot goods, there was a strong hope that Johnston could imitate the release of stockpiled cotton to regulate the market. In the afternoon, some new outside players entered the market, but industry insiders were still awaiting developments from Washington. Hester estimated mill consumption for the week at 189,000 bales, and Liverpool stocks at 274,000 bales. The market closed firm, with spot prices rising by ten pounds and futures prices rising by eleven to thirteen pounds. British cotton spot prices fell by four points, while futures prices rose by five to seven points. Indian cotton initially rose due to purchases by operators and rising silver prices, but later fell due to selling by speculative experts. Pinggole fell by 1.25 to 2.25 rupees, Aomula fell by 0.5 to 1.25 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 0.5 to 1 rupee. The original telegram records are on the left (dated the 3rd):</p>

<h3>Grains: Period Flour Fluctuates with Firmness</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the prices for each month fluctuated and turned sparse, with quotations for foreign wheat. Chicago was slightly better by four to eight points, and Canada had reciprocal quotations for four wheats, with a fluctuation of four points above and below. After the opening, trading for each month appeared sluggish. Most of the chips for this month were held by clients, with very few ins and outs. Although the weather is good for the distant months, the factories are generally watching and waiting. Without outside participation, the market remains stable, so the opening price is slightly firm. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, trading was slightly smoother, and prices fluctuated, still showing slight improvement. The main reason is that large factories have not released their stocks, and outside speculation is mostly constrained by economic conditions, so there are few sellers, and the market feels stable. It is said that if the wheat land receives good flood control this year, there will be an 80-90% harvest, so the next two weeks will be a crucial point for the year. As a result, this month's value is slightly better by 0.25 cents, June is better by 0.5 cents, July is better by 0.75 cents, August is better by 1.25 cents, September is better by 0.5 cents, and October is better by 0.25 cents.</p>
<h3>Wheat Afternoon Flour Leads</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market saw extremely sluggish trading for all months after the market opened in the morning. This is because there were no recent auctions, and for the distant months, the new wheat has not yet been harvested, and there is little certainty about the harvest. Although foreign wheat is priced reasonably, those who make fixed orders dare not sell short, so both buying and selling are silent. In the afternoon, trading was still sluggish, but the flour market turned firm, and the market was also slightly lifted. As a result, July and August each improved by three points, and the rest did not open. Spot wheat is slightly better by one or two points because the factory appetite is still active. Shandong wheat opened at 3.98 yuan, Nansuzhou wheat at 3.97 yuan, Yingzhou wheat at 3.96 yuan, and Henan wheat at 3.90 yuan. Fuxin took 2,500 bags, and Fu took 1,000 bags.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat 2nd 3rd Up/Down</p>

<p>Spot Goods 87.750 87.625 Fall 0.35</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Trades Another 5,000-6,000 Tons</h3>
<p>River Rice, Only Thick Japonica Improves by a Cent or So</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice customer transactions were extremely旺, the entire city opened with current rice, road goods, futures, weighed, returned to cage etc. totaling around 40,000 bags. Saigon was the smoothest, accounting for three-quarters of the total. The main destination was the inland, and after the drought in Beiyang, the appetite gradually became active. Yesterday's shipments reached 10,000 sentences. Since the market was so lively, prices rose by five or six points to nearly a cent. Large squeezed rice has been out of stock for a long time. A new batch arrived the day before yesterday and was sold through the same day, making the market even tighter. Yesterday, customers sold 2,000 bags of return to cage goods, which initially opened at 9.55 yuan, and has risen by 5 cents, then rising from 9.56-7 yuan to 9.62 yuan, 1.2 cents higher than the previous market price, but demand is still strong, but unfortunately there is no spot goods to meet the market. However, according to rice merchants, in the past two days, rice merchants have also finalized orders with foreign firms for a total of 5,000-6,000 tons of large squeezed and Saigon No. 3 rice and other broken rice. (South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various gangs were still not many, with only twenty or so ships arriving (a total of 4,000 stones). The market was stable, but sales were still weak, and the bagging appetite did not move, so although sellers took advantage of the scarcity of goods to raise prices, only thick japonica was slightly accepted by the local market, with a slight increase of a cent. The price of late rice was completely stable, and there was not much change in Yinbianyuan.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were fifteen or sixteen ships from various gangs downstream. White japonica on the market was sluggish in the early morning, but turned active in the evening. The market was flat and tired in the early morning, but turned tight in the afternoon. The appetite for early thin rice was still acceptable, and the price opened with a fixed price for thin rice, while flat rice was high, and medium-grade rice was slightly weak. White Yuan scattered transactions were active, and the price increased by nearly a cent. The prices of other goods also showed an upward trend.</p>
<h3>Southern Regions Begin to Handle Mung Beans</h3>
<p>Shanxi Soybeans Arrive for the First Time, Over 300 Bags</p>
<p>The mung bean sales market has been quiet for a long time due to seasonal factors. Recently, the southern gangs have begun to handle shipments, so the market has become more active, and the market is close to a cent higher than when it was cheap. Yesterday, a total of 180 bags of Niuzhuang tea beans were traded at a price of 5.58 yuan, 200 bags of Henan beans at a price of 4 yuan, 165 bags of Xiaoxihe mung beans at a price of 4.5 yuan, and 34 bags of Mingguang large-grain mung beans at a price of 4.9 yuan. There has been no change in soybeans for the time being. Yesterday, only Changde Oil Factory purchased 1,450 bags of Quanhe beans at a price of 3.7 yuan, 1,200 bags of Yingzhou beans at a price of 3.65 yuan, and 300 bags of Shuixikou beans at a price of 3.54 yuan. There were also more than 320 bags of Shanxi beans that were seen in the market for the first time, with a price opening at 3.9 yuan. The beans were shipped from Tianjin. According to industry insiders, the beans are of good quality, with round grains and black mouths, which can meet the appetite of oil factories and small grinding shops. If the cost can be reduced and the selling price is compatible, the beans will definitely sell well in the market.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: New York Silk Sales Remain Quiet</h3>
<p>Recently, the New York silk market has seen sluggish net sales, and the appetite of machine households has been dampened. Silk transactions are very light. General retailers hope that the silk sales will pick up at the beginning of the summer, so raw silk transactions can tend towards prosperity. Last month, New York's raw silk consumption decreased by 4,590 bales compared to the previous month, so European and American silk markets are mostly sluggish. The following is a report on New York's raw silk stocks in April:</p>
<p>Imports Consumption Stocks</p>
<p>Japanese Silk 40,335 38,872 35,540</p>
<p>European Silk 36 312 492</p>
<p>Russian Silk —— 31 29</p>
<p>Guangdong Silk 50 57 401</p>
<p>Shanghai Silk 340 485 1,125</p>
<p>Total 40,761 39,757 37,587</p>
<h3>Suian Zhenmei Green Tea Opens</h3>
<p>34 Yuan Lower Than Last Year</p>
<p>The first batch of new Suian Zhenmei green tea from Luzhuang was shipped to Yongxinglong Public Lift Yong and other tea shops yesterday, with more than 100 boxes of new goods. After the new samples were released, the China Tea Company and Tianyu Foreign Firm opened the market, with a price of 86 to 88 yuan. Due to the excessive exchange rate, the price per load was 34 yuan lower than last year. Tea merchants from various regions have sent out telegrams to tighten their purchases, predicting that the number of box teas will be reduced by one-third compared to last year.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Guangdong Gang Buys Melon Seeds and Raw Peanuts Vigorously</h3>
<p>Recently, black melon seeds have suddenly seen active sales in Guangdong, and the trend is quite active. In recent days, a total of more than 4,000 bags of ordinary Xukui seeds and Mingguang seeds have been purchased at prices ranging from 8.8 yuan to 7.2 yuan. After this move, the market immediately became tight. Although the goods purchased by the Guangdong gang are of low price, it is not easy to collect them. Moreover, the fourth quarter has passed, and credit is slightly looser, and the intention to enter the market is stronger, and the opening price has risen by two or three cents. After a transaction of 1,200 bags, the market seems to have a tightening trend. Since the number plate insists, the firm may take the path of raising prices.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the raw peanut market turned tight, and the Guangdong gang continued to purchase a batch, with Kaifeng Ren at 7.5 yuan and Dangshan Ren at 6.5 yuan, with a transaction of 70 tons, which was two or three cents higher than the previous market. Further increases are expected.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Talk of Adding Unified Tax; Over 10,000 Bags of Dutch Coarse White Sugar Open</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of the sugar market was flat. The public association divided the goods after the 24 coarse sand white, and the price was called 16.5 yuan the day before yesterday, which was not successful. Yesterday, it was divided at 4 cents, with a slight drop. Transshipment goods were transacted at 5.1 yuan. It is said that the sugar goods will be subject to a unified tax increase on June 1, so foreign firms are again active in dumping goods recently. Yong and opened 300 tons of Dutch coarse white that can arrive on May 18 at a price of 3.15 Dutch guilders, and Dachang opened more than 7,000 bags of customs warehouse goods at a price of 3.125 yuan, all new tax included. The market may have a chance to turn into an enterprise.</p>

<h3>Thoughts on Italy's Encouragement of Early Marriage</h3>
<p>— Cai Heng</p>
<p>The World War reduced the number of able-bodied men in the European countries involved by millions. On the one hand, due to the economic depression after the war, this situation was even more serious in countries such as Germany, France, and Italy. The number of single people is increasing day by day, and the population is decreasing. It is not that young men and women do not need to marry, but because of the impact of the economic difficulties after the war and the severe recession in recent years. Under the current social system, marriage is the way out for most women. After marriage, all daily expenses are mostly borne by men, and the birth of children after marriage will further increase the burden. Poor young people regard marriage as a different path, so late marriage, permanent singleness, and population decline have formed a serious problem in Europe after the war. In order to seek the survival of the nation and prepare for the second world war, the government authorities cannot but vigorously encourage marriage, promote early marriage, and promote pro-natalism.</p>
<p>Recently, it was reported that a dispatch from National News Agency in Rome said: "Italy has become a honeymoon country today. More than 2,000 new couples are provided with expenses by the Fascist Party to spend their holidays together. Each newly married couple can get 500 lira. This is one of the government's plans to encourage marriage." A Reuters dispatch also stated: "Yesterday, a total of 2,353 couples held weddings in Rome to follow the Fascist slogan of 'early marriage' and 'large families.' Most of the new couples are under the age of 25, and some are only 16 years old."</p>
<p>Is the implementation of early marriage and large families not our country's feudal system? And this system is actually promoted in the Fascist Italy of the 20th century, which cannot but be said to be a modern "spectacle." However, after we examine the actual situation, we feel that this also has its social origin: Because in recent international situations, the powers compete for armaments, seize territories, and prepare for the Second World War, so increasing the reproduction of the Italian nation is also one aspect of preparing for war. Therefore, there is the slogan "Women, return to the family!" Returning to the family, intensifying the manufacture of future "cannon fodder" and "meat shields." In the eyes of imperialists, this is the only work for women. Women do not need to participate in social undertakings, just bury themselves in the family and hurry up to manufacture "cannon fodder" and "meat shields." It can be said that women under Italian nationalism have become machines for creating military "meat shields!"</p>
<p>However, we still cannot but have doubts: The new couple can certainly spend their honeymoon trip with the government's bonus, but what about the future life problems? In the world's serious unemployment vortex, can these thousands of newly married couples get a decent job after marriage? Otherwise, today they may be happy honeymoon travel gods, but tomorrow they may become prisoners shackled in the unemployment hell.</p>
<p>The Italian authorities, in order to decorate prosperity on the surface and at the same time encourage childbirth and strengthen war preparations, have organized this unprecedented group wedding of "2,350 couples." But what benefits do these superficial tidbits have for the problem of unemployment and the lives of working women? The world's recession remains the same, and the crisis of war remains the same. The fundamental problems of society cannot be covered up by superficial decorations.</p>
<h3>Reflections on the Verdict of the Liu Jinggui Murder Case</h3>
<p>— Zi Jiu</p>
<p>The case of Liu Jinggui shooting and killing Teng Shuang, the wife of Lu Ming, at Zhicheng Middle School in Beiping on March 16, has now been sentenced by the Beiping District Court: Liu Jinggui's "premeditated murder" is considered to be pitiful in circumstances, and the original sentence (death penalty) is reduced by one-half according to law, and he is sentenced to a minimum of twelve years in prison. Lu Ming is innocent. It is heard that the prosecutor's office will appeal against Lu's verdict, and Liu's verdict seems to have been publicly recognized.</p>
<p>However, some people in society also believe that the verdict in the Liu Jinggui case is too lenient. The reason is: "The so-called premeditated murder is the meaning of deep planning and long-term consideration, so the criminal law stipulates that it should be punished with the death penalty. Moreover, Jinggui and Lu Ming were engaged not long ago, and they engaged in physical relations. After that, Lu Ming married Teng Shuang, and Lu and Liu went through considerable procedures - canceling the engagement and receiving compensation. But they still would have adultery with Lu in hotels for several days. She was romantic and unchaste herself, but instead accumulated resentment against the innocent Teng Shuang, and repeatedly sought to kill her, shooting her seven times in a row. She was cruel and ruthless, and there was nothing to be pitied. This kind of reduced sentence will give society a bad influence of encouraging crime." These words, when examined, seem to be very correct: Liu Jinggui's murder, the deep planning and long-term consideration beforehand, the calmness afterwards, and the eloquence when being interrogated seem to deserve to be said: "The circumstances are extremely abominable," and should be punished with the death penalty. On the other hand, Liu Jinggui's behavior seems to be inevitably romantic. She could not get Lu Ming's exclusive love because of her own romantic behavior, and repeatedly sought to kill the innocent Teng Shuang, deserving the title of "fierce person." This kind of abominable fierce person seems to really deserve to be killed as a warning to hundreds, giving later generations a lesson. In fact, every occasional person's behavior is dominated by the environment. On the one hand, Liu Jinggui was dominated by feudal ideas, and felt that once she had physical relations with someone, she had to marry him. Reading her confession, there are "I am a person who has lost her chastity," and "I am determined to fight him to the death," as well as "Relatives and friends always thought that it didn't matter to cancel the engagement, but they didn't know that we had exceeded the marital relationship." These words are clear evidence. On the other hand, men and women fall in love, and originally anyone would know when they reach a certain age, and Liu and Lu cannot be exceptions. However, the feudal forces in society are still acting strangely everywhere. Love between men and women is still not free. The biggest victim here is of course the woman. Therefore, we would rather say that Liu Jinggui is a victim of this era of new and old conflicts and contradictions. Therefore, if society remains the same, killing one is not enough to warn a hundred.</p>
<p>However, society can control people, and at the same time, people can create society. Young men and women, with the spirit of love, the courage to murder and commit suicide, can create society. It will not be difficult to have a day of realization. Some people think that the current young masters and young ladies, their living environment only allows them to talk about light love, get jealous, and they have nothing else to ask for. Here, I would like to use a famous saying from Kollontai: "Career is greater than love" to advise young people, especially young women. As for what our career is, we can only let everyone seek it for themselves.</p>

<h3>Section 3: Feudal Housewives and Marriage</h3>
<p>— Jun Hui</p>
<p>"All religions are nothing more than the external forces that dominate human daily life, empty and reflected in human brains, in other words, they are a reflection of earthly forces taking the form of heavenly forces." (Anti-Dühring)</p>
<p>Medieval Christianity was also a reflection in their minds of the life of absolute servitude between lords and serfs, nobles and commoners at that time. In other words, the power of earthly feudal lords took the form of the power of God in heaven.</p>
<p>The idol god of Christianity—God—was indeed the supreme power holder in the Middle Ages, ruling medieval society as Hitler ruled modern Germany—absolute and dictatorial! People are only allowed to believe in God and not criticize him, only to obey and not to resist! But the direct executors of this idol power are the landlords, nobles, and priests, the trinity of the feudal state! God is just a puppet!</p>
<p>Looking at the origin of Christianity, Christ himself was undoubtedly a great revolutionary who sacrificed his life to liberate the oppressed Jewish people. But later, his unfilial disciples sold the blood flowing from his heart cheaply to the ruling class at the time, and Christianity became a tool for the feudal state to rule the oppressed masses. All church systems, rituals, and doctrines were made to suit the tastes of the ruling class, and the task of deceiving and insulting the oppressed masses, especially women, was carried out to the greatest extent.</p>
<p>The insult and deception of women by Christianity is the most despicable and hateful. The day after God created Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, he placed all the sins on Eve. It is said that women are the root of evil that tempts men. Women are impure, inviting the sins of the world, and are temptresses who bring disasters to men.</p>
<p>The famous Church Father Tertullian (Terulien) made the following statement to women:</p>
<p>"You must know that you are Eve. God's judgment on women still exists today! Therefore, your sins still exist! You are the gate of the devil's domination! You are the fruit that broke the commandments, you are the most guilty of God's law, you are the one who tempted the men whom the devil dared not approach, you are the men who ruined God's image."</p>
<p>Christianity not only regards women as the source of sin, but also regards girls as the property of men, just like cattle and horses. The ninth commandment of the Old Testament is written like this:</p>
<p>"You shall not covet your neighbor's house, nor shall you covet your neighbor's wife, servants, cattle, horses, or anything else that belongs to your neighbor."</p>
<p>Putting wives and cattle and horses together like this means that women are objects belonging to men, like cattle and horses!</p>
<p>What is particularly interesting is that at the Council of Macon in 585 AD, there was a debate over whether women had souls, but it was only decided by a majority of one vote that women were also human beings with souls. But church law still stipulates that "women are not created in the image of God."</p>
<p>Christianity has also done its best to insult women in feudal kinship law. Christianity has established a monogamous marriage system on the basis of women's absolute servitude to men. For men, this is naturally a monogamous system in name, but in fact it is polygamy. The marriage law in medieval England had the following provisions:</p>
<p>"If a woman commits adultery, is the right to punish her at the disposal of the woman's husband?"</p>
<p>But when a man commits adultery, the right to punish him belongs to God's will. Regarding this point, the English Church Father Yerbrik cleverly explained it.</p>
<p>"Just as a husband punishes an adulterous wife, God also punishes an adulterous husband."</p>
<p>But how does God punish an adulterous husband? This is an unknowable mystery! And the husband's punishment of an adulterous wife is a cruel physical punishment. According to Xie Xikuaifu, feudal lords specially attached chastity belts to women during their absence to prevent their wives from committing adultery, and if there was unchaste behavior, they would beat her to death or execute her!</p>
<p>Christianity holds a Bible that insults women in one hand and caresses women's foreheads in the other, saying, "You are the abyss of sin, and the only way to atone for your sins is to obey. Obedience in this world is the paradise of the next life!" This kind of preaching is very effective for women who are absolutely oppressed! Because the medieval women who have already despaired of the real world can easily accept the "sleeping pills" of the next world and anesthetize themselves! In this way, Christianity wants to liberate women to the paradise of the next life, which has its unique nature of deception!</p>

<h3>After Reading the "Female Student Forum" in the Ta Evening News</h3>
<p>— Qian</p>
<p>I remember several weeks ago, the women's weekly of the Ta Evening News published a "Female Shop Assistant Forum" after reading it, and I didn't feel there was anything particularly special about it. On the evening of March 26th, after reading its "Female Student Forum," I felt compelled to say a few words.</p>
<p>A female student forum with a title of "A Glimpse into the Life of Female Students" only had four main members, and these four only represented two schools, one of which was a mission school. Of course, in today's world where religion is raising its head high, and the supernatural forces are gradually restoring their past glory, it may not be without significance to reveal some of the real life of mission schools to people. However, in the forum, the two female students, Misses D and C, from the mission school actually took the opportunity to preach to the reporters, and our dignified reporters didn't have any correct understanding of religion. I dare say, this has to be said to be the reason for the forum's failure.</p>
<p>Let us see how the two female students, C and D, as believers, promoted and advertised for mission schools and their religion, and at the same time, we can see to what extent the two ladies had been anaesthetised. (The following is a full transcript of the original forum)</p>
<p>"D: I like religion, science, and sociology the most. Because those who study religion take serving society as a prerequisite, so we must study sociology. With religion as our background, we add a little research to social facts. We believe that the power of religion can transform society."</p>
<p>"C: Our purpose in studying social sciences and religion is to seek welfare for society and work for society."</p>
<p>"D: People think that church schools are very restrictive, but we only feel very busy and don't feel restricted."</p>
<p>"D: Gentlemen, you are all experts in literature. Can I ask a question? I feel that if a person has no faith, it is easy for them to become passive. For example, the 'New Woman' in the New Woman movie, if she had faith, she would never have committed suicide."</p>
<p>Of course, people with correct knowledge will never think of "faith" like the anaesthetised Miss D, believing that the so-called "faith" is only the "faith in Jesus and God". We know that besides believing in God, there can be better faiths.</p>
<p>The conversation between the two female students, C and P, let us know how deeply the power of imperialist cultural aggression, that is, anaesthesia, has penetrated into the students of various mission schools. They can almost all be street preachers. Recently, Christianity has been rising and penetrating more deeply in China. We can also cite a definitive piece of evidence. The "Daily Talk" column in the Ta Evening News on the 26th had this passage:</p>
<p>"The number of Bibles sold has surged. Last year, the British and Foreign Bible Society sold a total of 10,970,609 copies of the Bible worldwide, and the number of copies sold in China alone reached 4,296,495, an increase of 394,200 copies compared to the previous year. Last year in China, all industries were in extreme depression, but the sales of the Bible were so prosperous."</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the true faces of the so-called pastors in China who "seek welfare for society and work for society," I would like to end with a statement made by a foreigner:</p>
<p>The Ta Evening News on April 13th carried a Reuters dispatch from London, saying that the British Mr. Maley proposed a motion entitled "China should be allowed to freely decide its own future." Maley spoke out, severely criticizing European pastors in China, saying, "Clergymen, with an extremely deceptive international behavior rarely seen in the world, stirred up their position in China. A Sino-French treaty drafted by a certain Catholic priest stipulated that the meaning of the treaty should be based on the French text. There is a clause in the French text that is not found in the Chinese text. This clause allows the church to acquire land. Thus, the church purchased the best land and maintained its ownership by force. Furthermore, the most evil expansion behavior ever heard of is seen in Annam."</p>
<h3>Seeking Refuge</h3>
<p>— Zi Gang</p>
<p>"So, how can this be arranged?"</p>
<p>These past two days, Second Aunt Sun, who works as a seamstress in a tailor shop, often sighs like this. Seeing her daughter, Shunzi, who is fourteen or fifteen years old, staring blankly, Sun Er and their daughter also sigh along with her.</p>
<p>"You know, I'm being paid half the wages of a male worker here. Otherwise, would the shopkeeper be willing to hire me? What about the food and drink for a few days? You're right, to reduce the number of mouths to feed at home, you sent Shunzi here to me --" She said in a low voice, "What if the shopkeeper dismisses me again..." She was mindful of the cold looks she had received for her husband and daughter's lodging.</p>
<p>Sun Er sniffed his red nose, wiped his dry, wrinkled forehead, and explained to the woman with a patience that defied boredom:</p>
<p>"I wouldn't have sent her out here if I had a way. The travel expenses alone cost five or six yuan, enough for how much grain? But this year's land, oh, this year's land..." He used a pretended cough to cover up the sadness from the bottom of his heart, his fingers twisting the broken edge of his blue cloth jacket: "Last year's autumn wheat didn't yield much grain. I was afraid that, like the previous two years, all the hard work would be in vain, and we would be squeezed to death. But in the end, we almost didn't even have enough for our own consumption, right? Last month, we planted spring wheat, but we didn't dare to rent more land and lose more labor. Although we're about to plant sorghum and castor beans, it won't make up for the losses."</p>
<p>Putting down the lined gown she was working on, Second Aunt Sun rubbed her presbyopic eyes. She thought of Shunzi's three younger sisters, the youngest of whom was only nine years old.</p>
<p>"It's really disappointing. Four money-losing girls!"</p>
<p>"They're all like silkworms after their second sleep, just when they're eating the most! Little Si can eat half a catty of coarse flour steamed buns in one meal! How can we support them!" Sun Er chanted this with a mixture of lament and joy. Sons and daughters were the same to him. The hardships of life had worn away at him, leaving a broad-minded heart. He didn't care about descendants or incense offerings. He was just waiting for the end of his life with his eyes open, like quietly finishing a puff of his almost extinguished dry tobacco.</p>
<p>"It would be good to find Shunzi a job. She sews cloth jackets and trousers well!"</p>
<p>Fifteen-year-old Shunzi sat quietly on the earthen bed, listening to her parents' discussion, understanding and not understanding. Finally, she blurted out:</p>
<p>"Mom, I'll go serve people like Aunt Lizi!" She had only heard that Aunt Lizi from the same village had gone to the city to serve people and could sometimes bring back three or four yuan for the family.</p>
<p>"Nonsense, send you to work for someone before you're married? Unless you're a girl who's been sold, but!" Her eyes reddened as she made that statement. "Child, if I had a way, I wouldn't send you into a fire pit."</p>
<p>Sun Er's red nose twitched again:</p>
<p>"Let her get married. Fifteen, uh, fifteen, is not too young. Just make do! —" He stroked his forehead and thought: "You were sixteen when you got married, right?"</p>
<p>The smile on the woman's lips froze in less than a minute: "Don't mention that. Getting married early means suffering more. Before a person has grown up, they have to endure so much hardship from their in-laws, their husband, and their children. If they have bad luck."</p>
<p>"There are plenty of matchmakers, some too old, some too young. Last time, when Sister Wang wanted to marry Shunzi to her thirteen-year-old Niuzi, Shunzi cried all night!"</p>
<p>The girl twisted the end of her braid, remaining silent. She vaguely pictured a snotty, mischievous child, the little Niuzi that Sister Wang was preparing to marry Shunzi to.</p>
<p>That evening, Second Aunt Sun sacrificed her night work and discussed a pathless path with Shunzi's father on the street corner.</p>
<p>"Let's find her a husband. Good or bad, it's better to have one less person to feed at home." Then, the father said self-comfortingly:</p>
<p>"These days, it's also worrying to have a grown-up girl at home. When the war starts, there's nowhere to hide. Once she's married, let others worry about it."</p>
<p>The woman frowned, without tears. Back in the shop, she collected the eight or nine yuan she had saved and a pair of silver bracelets. The next day, when she walked out of the alley again with Shunzi and her father, she lowered her voice and rubbed her red eyes:</p>
<p>"Let's all seek refuge separately. We can't worry about so much. Blame who!"</p>
<p>Second Aunt Sun stood blankly on the steps, looking ahead. A series of scenes imprinted themselves:</p>
<p>A fifteen-year-old child sat in a dilapidated red sedan chair, the remaining three girls opened their empty mouths, and Sun Er would have to stretch his sallow and emaciated arms to the fields, sweating profusely.</p>
<p>Special Issue of the Shanghai Science Toy Exhibition</p>
<h3>Hopes for Scientific Toys</h3>
<p>— Wu Tiecheng</p>
<p>A country has its customs, and a government has its policies. Customs are the prevailing trends of the time, the demeanor of the people, the fashion of society, and the style of the masses. What they express, even if it is a word, an action, a thing, no matter how small and ordinary, once it becomes a habit, a trend, the direction of the trend, even with great force, cannot be stopped. Therefore, those who are concerned about the times all take improving the customs of the country and society as their duty to save the nation and seek survival. To improve the customs of the country and society, we must cultivate the interests and customs of children throughout the country. The scientific toy movement advocated by the Shanghai Science Toy Exhibition Association is truly a very meaningful undertaking!</p>
<p>Because children are the future masters of the country and the rising life of the nation. Children are naturally active, full of vitality, and regard "play" as their second life. China's science is backward, and educators have never regarded children's toys as a powerful tool in education. They make do with what they have, do not improve, and do not think of using them. What children generally "play" with are either crude and evil masks or clay sculptures of Bodhisattvas. If not clay sculptures of Bodhisattvas, then they are just typical daily necessities with no educational significance! It is impossible to find anything that is rich in modern thought, scientific concepts, national consciousness, and national spirit! This is truly the misfortune of children and also the shame of education!</p>
<p>Today, on the day of the Science Toy Exhibition, Tiecheng, despite his lack of talent, dares to express his sincere hopes:</p>
<p>First, I hope that the government and society, especially educators, will deeply recognize the close relationship between children's toys and the cultivation of national and academic customs, and work together to promote scientific toys!</p>
<p>Second, I hope that children's toys will have a very close connection with modern industry and art, so that children's toys can be scientific, industrial, and artistic!</p>
<p>Third, I hope that society can recognize children's toys as a powerful tool for children's education and make full use of them. For example, what our nation lacks is modern thought and scientific concepts. Then we should introduce models of the latest scientific tools, embed anti-feudal ideas in toys, to instill and improve them. What our nation needs is national consciousness and national spirit. Then we should take modern weapons, melt national spirit, and make them into toys to inspire children's courage, cultivate children's patriotic sentiments, increase children's self-defense instincts, and cultivate children's excellent character, so as to contribute to the revival of our nation!</p>
<h3>The Importance of Children's Toy Exhibitions and Child Education</h3>
<p>— Pan Gongzhan</p>
<p>The strength or weakness, prosperity or decline of a nation depends on the quality of education. The quality of education depends on whether the measures taken for children's education are appropriate or not. Because children are the lifeblood of the nation and the sprouts of the race.</p>
<p>Among the strong countries in the world, there is none that does not pay attention to children's education. Germany wanted to revive the nation, so Hitler strongly advocated the militarization of children's education. Soviet Russia is a newly emerging country, and Stalin increased the funding for children's education in the Five-Year Plan. These all show the importance of children's education.</p>
<p>Originally, the purpose of education is to eliminate the shortcomings of life and reach the realm of truth, beauty, and goodness. Children's education is basic education, the beginning of cultivating perfect citizens. Because children are innocent and pure, their nature is good. If education is proper, then their "goodness" can be developed, and they can become useful people for the country in the future. If education is improper, it is easy for them to pick up bad habits and submerge their "goodness," and then they will inevitably become social pests in the future. Therefore, it is said that children's education is the beginning of "being human" education. In other words, children's education is to cultivate children's basic concepts of the nation and the country, so that after children grow up and serve society, they can act according to the concepts needed by the nation and the country.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must pay attention to what kind of country China is, and then we can know the needs of the environment and the survival strategies to be adopted. Judging from the current education in China, education is backward. Judging from the economy, the economy is even more bankrupt. Production has not developed, and imported goods are increasing day by day, and the people's livelihood is deteriorating as a result. If this continues, without waiting for imperialism to wield its sharp weapons and carry out its brutal slaughter, China will inevitably perish.</p>
<p>The situation in China is so serious, so how can we save the nation and seek survival? In this era of cultural competition and developed production, education alone is not enough to save ourselves, and only by developing industry can we survive. But under the current situation of economic bankruptcy and backward education, where should we start? This cannot but start from children's education first, and children's education must start from science. In the past, children's education mostly neglected the enlightenment of children's scientific emotions, so that children's innocent minds and lively skills were all sacrificed under the shackles of education, and science and technology also fell into a situation where they could not be developed.</p>
<p>In the future, for children's education, we should pay attention to children's psychology, enlighten their emotions, and not teach in a mechanical way. When instilling scientific knowledge in children, we need to focus on inducing specialization and gradually cultivating their scientific minds and concepts. Whether in the family or in the school, we should widely place scientific toys, to the greatest extent, for children to play with, so that they can understand the function and importance of science in an imperceptible way. Although this effect is not concrete, this invisible force is much stronger than mechanical teaching.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Science Toy Exhibition being held this time deeply understands the key to the past mistakes of children's education and the strategies that should be adopted now. From the surface, this exhibition is about the display of children's toys, but in terms of significance, it is profound and great. Because this has pointed out the path for the revival of the Chinese nation, which is to pay attention to the scientific education of children and to cultivate scientific talents needed in industry. Therefore, the role of this exhibition is not only limited to assisting the correction of a part of education, but to promote the fundamental improvement of education. This is just like the Middle Ages in the West, when theology was the basis of education, and later it was replaced by humanism and classicism; and in modern Soviet Russia, industry is the basis for the construction of the entire education system, which is equally important! Therefore, we should promote the spirit of this exhibition and popularize it throughout the country, so as to cultivate scientific children throughout the country.</p>
<p>The cultivation of scientific minds in children is the fundamental key to the strengthening of the country and the revival of the nation!</p>
<h3>The Significance of Holding a Scientific Toy Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Chen Gaimin</p>
<p>Science is the soul of human civilization, and there are already countless facts that can prove this, so there is no need to say more here. For two thousand years, China has stagnated in a small-scale peasant economy and a small-scale handicraft industry society, so it is inevitable and inevitable that there have been no amazing contributions in science. What is puzzling now is that new education has been established for more than 30 years. Since the late Qing Dynasty began to work hard on the study of sound, light, electricity, and chemistry, the number of people who have received scientific baptism is not small. Not only are there several hours of natural science in elementary schools, but also many people go directly to European and American countries with developed science to study every year, which is quite a few. However, there is still no Chinese person in the history of world science. (However, in Weiss's "Scientific Talks," which lists stories of scientific inventions from all over the world, China only has a few legends and no inventions.) Not to mention inventions, even the immaturity of the general public's scientific knowledge is extremely pitiful. Anti-scientific phenomena are manifested in all aspects. In this 20th-century world of science, science is so immature that nothing can be discussed. Even if there are no powers to oppress us, even if there are no warlords to partition us, such a backward nation cannot exist. Therefore, to revive China, we must start by promoting science.</p>
<p>Because decades of new education have still not achieved the slightest effect in science, some people believe that Chinese people do not have a scientific talent and that the Chinese nation cannot learn science well. This view is fundamentally wrong. Sixty years ago, when Japan first saw foreign ships entering, it was so frightened that it almost triggered an incident. This is as ridiculous as when the people of Shanghai in the late Qing Dynasty sank the railway tracks and vehicles of the Songhu Railway in Dagou Port. Unexpectedly, after several decades, Japan has already caught up with European and American countries, while China is still the same as before. This cannot be said that the physiology and brain of the Japanese people have changed from 50 or 60 years ago. Also, like the black people in North America, who were originally as foolish as the natives of Africa, since North America liberated slaves, black people have gradually begun to show their talents in academic circles. Furthermore, the Indian people, originally from the same Aryan race as the English and German peoples, in recent centuries, while the English and German countries have been leaping forward, India has fallen into the abyss and cannot extricate itself. Looking at it this way, we can know that the merits of a nation have nothing to do with the progress or backwardness of its culture. That China has no scientific hopes is not in the inferiority of the national character, but can be proven.</p>
<p>Since it is not about the inferiority of national character, what are its causes? The reason is that there is no scientific environment and no scientific training. Only in the limited school life stage, only relying on a few rigid textbooks, will not arouse scientific interest, will not cultivate scientific talents, and will not develop a "scientific mind" for research. If they are not trained well in childhood, even if they gain some scientific knowledge in adulthood, they will only gain some dead knowledge and will not succeed in living applications. Look at the children of foreign countries. Their actions and habits are fundamentally different from those of our country's "young adults." They like to destroy and build. Not only do they have many scientific environmental trainings in kindergartens and elementary schools, but also in their families and in the fields, they take bamboo heads, wood chips, knives, swords, nails, and hammers, and do and destroy as they please, fully expressing their scientific creativity. Moreover, not only in books, paintings, specimens, and models are there rich scientific implications everywhere, but the daily toys are really varied and ingenious. There are many things that adults in backward China may find inexplicable, but their five- or six-year-old children already understand the use of various toys very well. They are trained this way from an early age, and then they can give full play to their scientific talents in school and have scientific creations in society.</p>
<p>Looking back at our China, in ordinary families, not to mention schools, we cannot arouse scientific interest. Even the rigid scientific readings are extremely poor. One year ago, someone statistically analyzed the catalogs published by 37 bookstores. There were only 290 types of children's science books, of which 196 types belonged to theoretical aspects. There are only 94 types of practical books that children can make after reading. There are only 9 types of books on crafts and machinery that can best inspire children's reason and interest, and among these 9 types, only one is most suitable for children. From these valuable statistics, we can know that China cannot cultivate children's scientific interest and work habits from an early age. All education can only make them study and take exams, and know nothing else. When studying, they only passively listen to lectures and have no automatic creation. Under such an environment, even if the children of European and American countries are taught, they will be isolated from science. Therefore, the lack of progress in Chinese science is not because the Chinese nation is bad, but because there is no scientific training.</p>
<p>Some people have already paid attention to children's reading materials, but toys, which are equally important as reading materials, have not been taken care of by many people. In fact, toys are the basic tools for training children's scientific talent, because the period when imitation and creation are most abundant is in childhood, and the appeal of real objects is far greater than that of books. Therefore, promoting scientific toys is the primary task of promoting science. This is the only purpose of our Science Toy Exhibition, and it is also the greatest mission of our scientific movement.</p>
<p>We gather various toys containing science and display them publicly. In addition to entertaining children to arouse their interest in scientific toys, there are also the following five meanings:</p>
<p>(1) After parents see them, they will know the importance of toys, what scientific toys are, and can use this as a compass for selecting scientific toys.</p>
<p>(2) After teachers see them, they will know that in addition to books, there are toys, which are also important tools for educating children.</p>
<p>(3) After arts and crafts artists see them, they will know that in order to cultivate noble interests for the nation, they should also pay attention to the important tools of the next generation of citizens and should devote a part of their strength to this.</p>
<p>(4) After scientists see them, they will know that in order to get good results in the laboratory, they should first cultivate scientific talents in the family, and improving toys is also a responsibility that scientists should have.</p>
<p>(5) After toy manufacturers see them, they will know that toys are related to the nation and the country, not just small commodities, and should strive for excellence.</p>
<p>In addition to these five meanings, the association itself also has a major purpose, which is to ask experts to summarize and criticize the many toys collected and put forward suggestions for improvement, so that manufacturers can have the opportunity to improve and progress.</p>
<p>Finally, what I want to solemnly state is that the preparation time and manpower for this time are not enough, so it cannot be expressed as ideally as possible. I hope that those who care about this matter will not hesitate to give guidance and criticism so that it can be improved when it is held for the second time in the future.</p>

<h3>On Extravagance</h3>
<p>— Fan Xing</p>
<p>In theory, extravagance stems from desire. Desire is instinctive, innate. If humans had no desires, they would not seek to advance society, and society would cease to progress. Desire is not limited to one type; some are material desires, leading to consumption, while others are spiritual desires, leading to creation and expression. Generally, in civilized societies, the higher the degree of civilization or culture, the higher the need for desire. Therefore, the higher enjoyments of civilized humans are often phenomena arising from the elevation of desire, and this phenomenon causes human civilization to increase accordingly. We only hope that humanity universally raises the general enjoyment of life, and that all items previously considered luxuries naturally become necessities for everyone. For example, a toothbrush, though not very expensive, was once only accessible to those living above the poverty line. The general population had yellow and black teeth and did not use toothbrushes, but now, due to the increase in the level of civilization, there is a growing trend toward popularization. However, there are still clearly lower-class masses, such as old farmers and laborers, who cannot afford to use toothbrushes. This, I can only say, is the misfortune of humanity, a stain on history! Wouldn't it be better if every family had a radio playing in the future?</p>
<p>If the world could one day live a life of extravagance, I would only feel that humanity is moving upward, not that humanity is falling. But if the minimum needs that the majority deserve are used to fulfill the excessive enjoyment of one or two individuals, then this kind of extravagance is indeed a fall of humanity, confirming the inevitability of human destruction.</p>
<p>Montesquieu said: "If the rich are not free to spend money, the poor will starve to death." This statement is specious. The poor do not starve because the rich are willing to spend money, and the poor do not starve to death because the rich are willing to spend money, but because the rich have taken the money of the poor. Therefore, today's market downturn and weak purchasing power are not because everyone has spent all their money, but because the majority of people do not have the money to spend. Therefore, there is no sufficient reason to oppose extravagance, but rather, it is necessary for everyone to be able to be extravagant in order to truly revitalize the market. Here, it is a question of ability. How to "be able" is the question.</p>
<p>I think that if everyone can afford it, being a little extravagant in material things is not a bad thing, but being extravagant in "time" is really unacceptable. A certain celebrity once said: "China is the most extravagant country." At first hearing, this seems like a joke. It is clear that most Chinese people live at the lowest level of the poverty line, so how can it be said that it is the most extravagant country? In fact, the Chinese people's extravagance of time is indeed the best in the world! Did Liang Qichao not say: Carrying a birdcage, holding a water pipe, when people ask him: What have you been doing lately, the answer is always boring leisure! You think, such people, such a country, isn't it terrible? When will it be good?</p>

<h3>The Fishing and Hunting Life of the Indigenous Tribes</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Taiwan Correspondence</p>
<p>The indigenous tribes of Taiwan still preserve a special form of primitive social clan community. There are two particularly well-organized tribes there, namely the Seediq and the Thao. The basic form of this type of indigenous tribal social organization is the so-called "indigenous village." In the pre-Qing era, Taiwan was a tributary state of the Qing Dynasty, and at that time, there were certain prescribed administrative organizations. Since being seized by Japan, there have been some changes again. However, these externally imposed systems did not arise naturally; there is no need to describe them now. What we want to introduce here is the natural form of indigenous tribal social life and organization based on fishing and hunting.</p>
<p>The land of the Seediq and Thao tribes is the common property of the clan. Each member of the clan can use a portion of the communal land to the extent that they do not interfere with others. Each member of the clan has the following rights: (1) to hunt freely within the communal land; (2) to cultivate mountain forests and wilderness; (3) to open roads, harvest bamboo and wood, and collect various natural products as items for exchange;</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>(4) to build houses for residence. There is a lot of communal land among the indigenous tribes; when farming exhausts the land, it can be left fallow, returned to public management, and new land can be claimed.</p>
<p>How did the communal land system described above arise? Was it formed by the blood relationship of the clan? No! Although each member of the clan commonly worships an ancestor and holds collective sacrificial ceremonies, that kind of customary relationship is not the basis of the economic ownership system. Because the economic ownership system is related to the labor production process – this is demonstrable by the following facts.</p>
<p>The general methods of hunting by indigenous tribes include fire hunting, drive hunting, ambush hunting, pursuit hunting, crushing, traps, bamboo needles, noose traps, and pitfalls. Among these many methods, fire hunting, drive hunting, and noose traps require the joint labor of the entire tribe; ambush hunting and pursuit hunting require the joint labor of three to five people; the others can usually be accomplished by one person. From this, we can see a significant point, which is that in most cases, one person cannot succeed; communal hunting is the main content of their indigenous life.</p>
<p>Indigenous tribes have what is called a "hunting group," which is a public organization temporarily formed by relatives, friends, and like-minded people. The remaining vestige of the primitive hunting group form is the current public hunting group. Every year, the hunting around the time of the sacrificial ceremonies is carried out by the public hunting group. This kind of public hunting group not only engages in hunting work but also has military tasks in its activities. Sometimes, it is entirely relied upon to resist invading enemies.</p>
<p>The hunting grounds of the Seediq tribe are still owned in common by all members to this day. Regardless of the member's surname, anyone can hunt freely within them. Moreover, although the hunting group is organized by the members of a single "indigenous village" or the members of a single tribe, its organization is not unique to the indigenous tribes; it evolved from the primitive clan hunting grounds and hunting groups.</p>
<p>As for the hunting grounds of the Thao tribe, they are also owned in common by each clan. There is no need to repeat the description here.</p>
<p>The disposition of items obtained from hunting is stipulated as follows among the Seediq tribe: the hunting dogs that first chase out the wild animal, the hunting dogs that bite the animal, and the person who shoots the animal first obtain a portion of the wild animal; the remaining meat is divided equally among the members of the hunting group.</p>
<p>The Thao tribe also has a similar custom: in the case of communal hunting, a portion of the meat is given to the person who shoots the animal and to the owner of the dog that chases the animal; the rest is divided equally among the members of the group. It is said that among the northern Thao indigenous tribes, each family in the village also receives a share of the spoils even if they did not participate in the hunt.</p>
<p>There is another tribe, the Amis, which has the following customs when hunting together: that is, the person who first strikes the wild animal can obtain the animal's head, the meat of the ribs within five ribs, and the hide. The person who strikes the wild animal the second time can get one front leg. The one who initially captures the animal can get two hind legs; if the wild animal is male, the scrotum must also be cut off and given to him. When a hunting dog has special merit, its owner receives special items. For example, the owner of the dog that first discovers the wild animal and chases it can get two hind legs; the hunting dog that first bites the wild animal is equal in merit to the first striker, and its owner can get the head, rib meat, and hide. The above rules are implemented at the time of hunting the animal. When hunting is completed and everyone gathers in one place, among the recipients of the awards described above, those who obtained the front and hind legs divide the animal legs into two parts, cutting them off from the knee joint, and offer the larger part to the hunting group, and the rest remains their own. As for the spinal meat and internal organs, they are divided equally among the companions; the recipients of awards only get slightly less meat than the average member of the group.</p>
<p>From the facts described above, it can be known that the items obtained are completely and clearly the common property of the hunting group. The meritorious members are only being rewarded. From this, the following two principles can be derived: first, the proceeds of joint labor are shared by everyone in the "indigenous village"; second, members who have contributed to the joint production are given appropriate compensation based on the size of their contribution. These two principles are exactly the same as the situation in ancient primitive communities, and they arise naturally from practical life analysis.</p>
<p>In addition to hunting groups, there is also an organization called "fishing groups." This is also a very natural state of life.</p>
<p>There are many methods of fishing. For example, fishing with hooks, fishing with cages, and feeling for fish can all be done by one person alone; however, the harvest from this kind of individual work is very limited. The main methods are still these: one is to extract sap from fish vines and pour it into rivers or seawater to anesthetize the fish, then scoop the fish from the surface of the water; another is to drain the water from rivers or ponds or block the flow of streams and then pick up fish in shallow water or gravel; still another is to cast nets or seine nets to catch fish... These methods often require many people to work together. This kind of communal fishing is as meaningful as communal hunting. The proceeds from communal fishing are still appropriately divided according to the labor exerted by each member.</p>
<p>The hunting and fishing of the indigenous people not only constitute the living relationships of the primitive society of the indigenous tribes, but also, because hunting and fishing are rich in group entertainment, they create an extremely close and simple atmosphere in the communal life of the indigenous people where "each takes according to their needs and each does according to their ability." Because of this close and simple advantage, the agricultural life and communal land system of the indigenous tribes have acquired an extremely inevitable relationship.</p>

<h3>The Art of Judging People</h3>
<p>— Qian Jun</p>
<p>Everyone cannot live in isolation, and everyone must live in society. Therefore, it is very necessary to know one's friends and even the contemporary people, because they can directly affect one's life. The art of judging people is not only very important for individuals, but also the most difficult thing to do. For thousands of years in China, the possession of "the ability to recognize talent" has been used as a standard for evaluating the wisdom and foolishness of individuals, and this is not without reason. And many virtuous and wise people have often failed to recognize people, which shows that this is indeed a very important and difficult subject. Emperor Taizong of Tang can be counted as the most brilliant monarch in history, but he ruined his own empire by mistakenly using figures like Yang Guozhong and Gao Lishi. The fact that Su Laoquan, who was full of learning and knowledge, could not recognize Wang Anshi's talent and instead wrote the "On Identifying Traitors" to ridicule him is clear evidence.</p>
<p>There is also a lot of preparation involved in the art of judging people. Those who practice fortune-telling judge a person's fate and fortune solely from their natural physical body. This kind of art of judging people naturally does not need to be taken into account. However, in custom and even in history, there are also many examples of people who do not base their judgment on the superstitious methods of fortune-tellers, but still judge people solely from their natural physical body. For example, Confucius, who judged people by their appearance and lost Ziyu, is a famous example. It is very clear that people's consciousness and behavior are products of society and have very little to do with people's natural physical body. Therefore, the uselessness of this kind of art of judging people is almost self-evident.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the method of judging a person based on their individual consciousness and behavior. Although it cannot be said that this kind of art of judging people is absolutely wrong in any situation, the general habit is to judge the person being judged in isolation from their society, limited to judging them based on their consciousness and behavior itself. Therefore, when people comment on their friends and contemporary people, they can only hear them say things like how this person thinks, how they behave, and how correct or wrong their thoughts and behaviors are in the critic's evaluation, but they do not hear them trace back to how society and the environment determine that they produce such thoughts and behaviors. We can also conclude that this kind of method of judging people is completely wrong. Because people's thoughts and behaviors are all products of society, their thoughts and behaviors must represent the social landscape corresponding to them. If you only look at the individual and their conscious actions when observing them, and do not delve into the root of where their thoughts and behaviors come from, you will never understand the reason for their thoughts and behaviors. If a person's thoughts and behaviors are stripped of their social meaning, then they simply become the monotonous activities of the physiological natural function, becoming the expression of the general material function of organisms. In the essence of this activity, in his individual independent unit, there is no such thing as good or evil. A dog wagging its tail to welcome its owner has no meaning of good behavior, and it biting a guest has no meaning of evil, the reason is that the simple natural function of animals, the outbreak of emotions and behaviors, has no social meaning, we cannot judge it as good or evil. If we observe people's behavior and thoughts only with the individual as the unit, and criticize them from their thoughts and behaviors themselves, then it is equivalent to adding an evaluation of good and evil to the dog's wagging its tail and biting people, which is equally superfluous and boring. Not only that, but individual thoughts and behaviors are changeable, and therefore often contradict themselves before and after. Napoleon once revolted against the French royal family, but Napoleon himself also became emperor. If you observe Napoleon from the individual standpoint alone, then it is inexplicable. If you judge him from the social evolution of France, from the social changes corresponding to him, and from the changes in his personal status, then you can know that his thoughts and behaviors are not self-contradictory, but that the contradiction is the contradiction of French society, the contradiction produced in the evolution of French society. Furthermore, in the process of realizing the requirements of a certain society, often the highest purpose is hidden inside the superficial appearance, and the appearance of circumvention is only a means to achieve the purpose. This is exactly like our ultimate goal of navigation being Tokyo, but if there are pirates or reefs lying in the middle of our route, then we will steer the ship to the left and right, but this is only a temporary strategy, and the goal is still unchanged. Because of this, the outward expression of each person's temporary thoughts, speech, and behavior is often inconsistent with their inner heart, and sometimes it is a necessary means to consciously use this as a cover for their true face, so that people will not suspect them. Even thieves say they are thieves, which is the same reason. Therefore, if we observe individuals and only pay attention to the temporary superficial appearance of their words, deeds, and thoughts, and do not find out their inevitable process of the past and future from their social background and life foundation, we cannot know this person. In this way, we can only regard the sweet-talking and treacherous as good people, and regard Spinoza, who is at odds with the world, as a madman. In short, if we judge people only from their individual, their consciousness itself, then we will not be able to know this person, and instead will be deceived by their magnificent outward words and deeds, and will regard the most harmful things they do to you as the best things. You will not even know that you were killed by them when you are killed. Of course, there is no need to talk about wanting to predict the inevitable trend of this person's actions in order to accurately judge what will eventually happen to them.</p>
<p>Because of this, if we want to be able to make correct judgments and recognitions of our friends and contemporary people, then in the study of the art of judging people, we must adopt scientific methods to dissect each person. This method, in principle, is based on the knowledge of social sciences, that is, to observe the changes in society from the historical role of the development of the entire society, from the social foundation and environment of the observed, and from the real social events, and to find the source of each person's conscious behavior and the reasons for these temporary changes in conscious behavior there. In this way, no matter how changeable the words and deeds of the observed are, we can recognize them, we can determine their past and future, and we can also not be deceived by their outward embellishments and affectations. For example, if we observe Dr. Hu Shih's limited reformist life, we must start from his education in the United States, from his doctoral status, professorial status, and even what he</p>

<h3>The Issue of Coeducation</h3>
<p>— Li Junwen</p>
<p>In the newspapers of a week ago, there was a news item stating that the Beijing Municipal Government had issued an order to severely ban coeducation in private secondary schools in order to maintain social morality. Although this is only a change in educational administration limited to the city of Beijing, in our opinion, this inappropriate, no, simply absurd measure not only casts a bad reputation on the educational circles of Beijing, but also leaves a major blemish of going backward on the entire Chinese educational community.</p>
<p>Coeducation was originally a system created in the United States to facilitate teaching. Later, it was recognized by general scholars as indeed having many advantages, and therefore adopted by the educational circles of various countries. As for this system in China, it is even more important, and this is a fact that no one can deny. Coeducation mainly has about four advantages. One: It can save educational expenses. The most difficult thing in running education is the issue of funding. If men and women cannot study together, then to make people in a region , , while in our country, where the level of education is low and educational funding is insufficient, can we allow ourselves to do this? But if men and women study together, this difficulty can be avoided. Two: It reduces immoral behavior between the sexes. China has always separated men and women. Under this isolated situation, one will often arouse an unusual interest in the opposite sex, and even do things that are harmful to social morality. Coeducation may be somewhat different at first, but after a considerable period of time, because the two sides have become accustomed to the norm, it will no longer be surprising. Three: It cultivates women's independence. Chinese women who have not received education certainly do not need to be mentioned. Even women who have received education often have the idea that women are permanently subordinate to men, and believe that men's abilities are always stronger than women's. In fact, this is a huge mistake. To break this concept, more education is certainly needed; however, if men and women can study together, it can make them truly understand that men are not that great, and women are not necessarily inferior to men. Four: It consolidates the foundation for free marriage. Although there are many men and women who are blindly calling for , , the result after marriage is , . It is not that young men and women are not qualified for free marriage, but because their understanding of each other is not thorough enough, that is, because social interaction has not matured, so many young people have become victims of this era. To remedy this defect, we must rely on coeducation.</p>
<p>However, in adolescence, it is the period when lust is at its peak. So-called "immoral" things are naturally difficult to guarantee that they will not happen. Indeed, this point alone is enough to create an excuse for celebrities to ban it. However, we only feel that the authorities' move is somewhat like throwing away food for fear of choking. At the same time, if we think about it from the opposite perspective, even if men and women are separated, will things that are harmful to social morality not happen?</p>
<p>Even Turkish women, who have always been conservative, are now making rapid progress. In the past, Turkey did not have coeducation, but now it does. Yet in China, in this source of the new culture – Beijing – such an extremely unreasonable thing that is enough to be ridiculed by foreigners has happened. Could it be that the retrograde move of saving the country by reciting classics is not enough, and we want to have men and women not touching hands and returning women to the family?</p>

<p>belongs to society, etc. As long as we can clarify these past historical and social states, we can judge and recognize him. If we observe Gandhi and his policy of non-resistance, as long as we can understand the historical role of religion in Indian society, and understand the social situation in which Indian industrialists and merchants want to resist British rule but dare not resist, we can understand Gandhi's personality and his thoughts. Yes, there is an art of judging people, but it is not the art of fortune-tellers that can enable us to recognize a person, but we must use the methods of social science as our daily art of judging people. Knowing people is necessary for every individual, because individuals other than ourselves, their thoughts and behaviors, can directly affect our lives. Let's all learn a little scientific art of judging people.</p>

<h3>How Did I Learn Esperanto?</h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>I received eight dollars from the account book – a month's salary, and with a heart full of joy and doubt, I boarded the streetcar to Kadelu (for half a year, I had been swindled out of hard-earned money by general unaccredited cram schools (of course, there were also well-run ones) in search of a little knowledge, but "knowledge" had not progressed at all. "This time, I should be more careful," I said to myself on the streetcar.</p>
<p>After getting off the car, I found the Shanghai Esperanto Association hidden deep in the alley according to the address. I pushed open the door and asked the staff for a copy of the charter, and sat down to read it carefully. At that time, a member of the "Esperantist Service Corps" ran over to explain a few doubts to me, such as the possibility of an international common language. From the idealism of Esperanto to the realism of Esperanto... his sincere and inspiring words strengthened my determination to learn Esperanto. At that time, I no longer hesitated to take out three dollars to pay the tuition for the lecture class and bought a textbook to go home and read it vaguely for an evening.</p>
<p>Since that day, I began to be an Esperantist. The teacher of our lecture class was surnamed , a gentle, enthusiastic and tireless middle-aged man. The extracurricular tutor was surnamed D, also a very humble gentleman who answered every question. With their lively guidance, all of us in this class completed the basics of Esperanto in just three months. In the process of learning, I once wanted to interrupt my studies because of some grammatical difficulties, but fortunately, the teacher and other veteran comrades constantly encouraged our interest through tea parties, wall newspapers, etc., and I finally overcame the difficulties and continued to study. In these three months of hard struggle, I not only learned a new language, but also felt that my thinking had made great progress, because Esperanto is the best tool for oppressed nations all over the world to contact and unite with each other.</p>
<p>Now, with the help of the dictionary, I can freely read books and newspapers. I have already read Turgenev's "Fathers and Sons," Yuli Barki's "Hurrah," Gorky's "How I Learned to Read," Bogdanov's "Red Star," and I am currently reading Gladkov's "Roar, China!" I have also subscribed to four magazines: the Soviet "On Guard," the Japanese "Advance," the Hungarian "Literary World," and the American "Scientific Magazine." As for the application of Esperanto, I have also started corresponding with comrades abroad, and I have received more than sixty letters, including from seventeen countries and more than twenty kinds of occupations. From the correspondence, I learned many things that I had never known before.</p>
<p>In fact, Esperanto made me abandon my old ideas in the past and began to understand this world. For me, although I have only studied Esperanto for less than a year, it has given me more help and inspiration than all the things I have learned in school in the past.</p>

<h3>The Status of the Brain</h3>
<p>— Han Qi</p>
<p>Isn't the human brain quite obviously located at the top of the entire body? Yet here we are discussing the question of 'the status of the brain,' which at first glance seems very strange, but in reality, it is not strange at all. From the perspective of the natural organization of the human body, it is true that the brain is the head of the entire body, but in terms of the function of the brain, very few people can accurately assess its status.</p>
<p>Religious people say that humans are the sons of God, born of the divine. They separate humans from the animal kingdom, isolating humans from the natural world. This means that they not only elevate the brain above natural objects but also elevate humans above the natural world. It was not until after the Renaissance, especially after the emergence of the theory of biological evolution, that people realized that humans also evolved from animals. Those who had long departed from the natural world, from that time on, returned to their original position, once again becoming one of the objects of the natural world, belonging to the ranks of animals. However, in the eyes of many philosophers, human thought is a special spiritual entity with principles, moral laws, reason, and so on that are not governed by the laws of natural evolution and change. In their view, these things are innate in the universe, even existing before all things. However, thought is clearly a function of the brain. If thought can exist in another world separate from the natural human organism, then it is logical that the brain cannot exist in the natural organic body of a human. The brain does not reside in the natural world; it is something that resides in another world. Not only that, according to many philosophers, natural things such as heaven, earth, the sun, and the moon only exist because of subjective thought; without thought, they would not exist. Therefore, thought is supreme. Since thought comes from the brain, then the brain is even more supreme. Without the brain, there would be nothing. Thus, the status of the human brain is not only at the head of the human body, but its supreme status is excessively elevated, rising above all things in the world. It is the unique, first-existing thing. It is not natural matter that evolves and creates the brain, but the brain that creates everything in the world. According to the above statement, is it not very necessary for us to accurately assess the status of the brain?</p>
<p>In terms of the process of world evolution, although we do not know when atoms and electrons came into existence, we can at least determine that other solar systems existed before our solar system. The Earth came into existence only after our sun had existed for hundreds of millions of years. Life came into existence only after the Earth had existed for hundreds of millions of years. After single-celled organisms existed, it took tens of millions of years of evolution for lower animals to become higher animals and then to produce humans. Although humans had a brain located at the top of the body from the beginning, the brain at that time was probably not much different from the brains of animals. That is to say, the ability to think was not very developed. Thinking gradually developed in the brain as a result of the gradual progress of thousands of years of social life. Thus, although the brain is at the head of the natural human organism, it is also produced by the evolution of natural things. As for thinking, it is not only a product of the brain but also a product of society. Thinking cannot be elevated above the natural world, cannot exist prior to natural matter, and the brain cannot elevate its status above natural things, cannot exist prior to natural matter. Not only that, thinking and the human brain cannot be elevated outside of society, existing prior to society. If separated from society, human thinking and the human brain would cease to exist; all that would remain would be the vitality of animals and the brains of animals. According to this, although the status of the brain is at the head of the human body, it can only occupy an equal position with other natural things within the natural world, occupy the same space and time, and cannot rise above everything in the world.</p>
<p>Indeed, the thinking produced by the human brain is great. It can recognize and think about everything, guide human actions, and create the overall life of society based on these actions, as well as transform the natural world. However, neither the understanding of nature nor the understanding of society can create a permanent and unchanging perfect schema and knowledge in one go. This means that it still has flaws that need to be corrected and supplemented at any time, and the progress of science is precisely pointing out this. Because of this, it is completely wrong to say that human thought is supreme in a certain space and time. Because the factors it contains, the areas that need to be improved, from the perspective of the infinite process, far outweigh the parts that do not need to be improved. Naturally, human beings use their brains to think and develop infinitely forward. Therefore, human thinking is still supreme in this sense. However, even so, we must know that social thinking is the comprehensive result of the thinking of tens of millions of people in the past, present, and future, and not the achievement of an individual. Moreover, this comprehensive effect is still limited, limited to the extent that human beings themselves can fully exist for a long time, which is very clear.</p>
<p>From this perspective, the human brain becomes supreme with the effect of the thinking it produces, and at the same time, it is not supreme. Because in the general evolution of the world, thinking is a product of the brain, and the brain itself is a product of nature. It can recognize nature and transform the world, but it can only transform the world according to natural laws and social laws. This kind of improvement is limited to the continuation of human beings themselves, and only in this continuous progress does it have its infinite process, expressing its supremacy. The human brain is at the head of the natural human organism. In the evolution of the universe, it can only be reduced to the original position of the human animal organism, reduced to the status of natural things. It is not something that exists prior to everything, nor does it have a supreme and sacred position that rises above everything. The brain is the property of humans and nature; it cannot independently stand outside the world and fulfill its position of guiding the world. Natural evolution has to produce and transform it; nature gives it the data and laws, commanding it to think and the master of work.</p>

<h3>Introducing "Social Critique"</h3>
<p>— Fang Rong</p>
<p>—Published at 290 Fuzhou Road, priced at four cents per issue—</p>
<p>"Social Critique" is a small bi-monthly publication. It is entirely printed in beautiful imitation antique characters. Above the title of each article, there are novel and wonderful illustrations. Anyone who sees it will naturally praise its exquisite printing and beautiful appearance. Indeed, when we look at this small publication, its appearance alone gives us a pleasant impression, unlike those publications that are cluttered with poorly printed characters, which are so annoying. As for the content, I can say that it is completely in line with its name, "Social Critique." This small publication can grasp in a timely manner and provide correct judgments on all social phenomena that occur in the real world and are closely related to us. Recently, the problems of suicide and homicide, unemployment and crime, and those strange and bizarre social phenomena of worshiping gods and believing in ghosts that have occurred in society, can all be found in "Social Critique" with accurate explanations. At the same time, this small publication also has columns such as "Current Affairs Commentary," "Life Sketches," "Domestic and Foreign Correspondence," "Non-Humorous Essays," and "Popular Academic Lectures." The writing in these columns is lively and meaningful. Even the "Non-Humorous Essays" are different from those popular humorous articles that only aim to win the smiles of wealthy women. They not only have "laughs" but also have profound social significance, such as "On Saving the World with Three Wounds" (first issue), such as "The Evolution of the Ghost World" (second issue)...etc., which are essentially different from the humorous articles of the Lin Yutang school. In addition, at the end of "Social Critique," there is also a column called "Bi-Monthly Society," which contains contradictory, laughable, and tragic events that have occurred in society in the past half-month. Reading it not only makes people feel as "relaxed" as reading the "Analects," but also allows people to correctly understand what kind of society the current society is in this "relaxation."</p>
<p>The writing in "Social Critique" is very simple and interesting, and it is effortless to read. It is indeed a good reading material for general junior clerks, unemployed and out-of-school young friends, and middle school students. Therefore, I specially write a brief introduction in the "Amateur Weekly," which guides the lives of general professional personnel, and contribute this small publication to its readers. At the same time, it is said that the authors of this small publication are all pseudonyms of "celebrities" in the literary world. For the sake of the general readers and for the sake of Chinese society, we hope that the authors of this publication will work harder to make this publication more and more substantial. If we have our "extravagant hope," it would be better if "Social Critique" could be changed to a weekly publication because the current bi-monthly publication cannot satisfy people. I don't know if the gentlemen of "Social Critique" can do this recently?</p>

<h3>New Facilities at the Shanghai Esperanto Association Training Class</h3>
<p>Although Esperanto has been introduced to China for more than twenty years, the number of people in the country who are proficient in Esperanto is still not widespread. A few scholars only rely on self-study or correspondence to obtain this treasure of knowledge of the times. The Shanghai Esperanto Association, in view of this, has spared no effort in setting up classes to teach. Since its establishment less than three years ago, the association has held eleven training classes. The twelfth class will begin on May 7th. The Education Committee of the association has decided that, starting from this class, self-edited textbooks will be used to eliminate the drawbacks of using various textbooks published in Europe and Japan that are not suitable for Chinese people. It was also decided to set up tutors in addition to lecturers to enhance teaching effectiveness. This can be said to be a major advancement in the history of the Esperanto movement in China. The location is in Yongping Lane, Kad Road. The class time is from 7 PM to 9 PM. Those who are interested in learning Esperanto can go to obtain applications and register.</p>
<p>Biography of a Celebrity</p>
<h3>The Pure Poet Shelley (4)</h3>
<p>— Written by Japanese Tsurumi Yusuke, translated by Zhou Leshan and Qi Junfu</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>Shelley, upon returning to London, was as per usual, penniless. It's a strange thing that he was troubled by money all his life, but never starved to death. The reason he was poor his whole life was because he wasn't concerned about money.</p>
<p>In a fit of anger, his father and Harriet's father said that they wouldn't give the young couple a penny. However, in the end, as usual, it was his uncle who interceded, and his father allowed him to continue to receive two hundred pounds a year. Harriet's father also gave her two thousand yuan a year. Only then were they able to escape the line of starvation.</p>
<p>At this time, he did many absurd and incredible things. His thinking became more and more revolutionary. At that time, England, which was at war with Napoleon, used iron-fisted pressure to suppress free thought in the country. Therefore, Shelley put his own revolutionary essays into small wooden boxes and threw them into the sea, or scattered them in the air by sailboat, or put them in empty beer bottles and floated them down the river. He used this method to enlighten the people who picked them up. He was afraid that his books would be displayed in the stores of the Oxford University bookstore, causing trouble for the bookstore owner, so he used this method of not implicating others in an attempt to spread his thoughts to society. His loving spirit and the childlike means he took to put this spirit into practice cannot help but make people smile. This was his life.</p>
<p>He was, as someone commented on him, "a spirit of the vast sky who mistakenly fell from a corner of the sky," a person of bright purity who had no malicious intent and was spotless. Dealing with the world with a childlike innocence, in the world's eyes, is what is called absurd. This purity and absurdity were the cause of this Apollo-like beautiful genius child's tearful life.</p>
<p>He was like a sheep that had strayed into a pack of wolves.</p>
<p>VI</p>
<p>At this time, he associated with Godwin, the author of Political Justice, whom he had loved to read since he was a child. The philosopher Godwin lived a life that was completely contrary to the philosophy he published. However, Shelley, who privately admired and worshiped him, did not notice these things. With his own purity and integrity, he regarded everyone in the world as good people.</p>
<p>Godwin's house had three half-sisters and two sons. These women caused a great commotion for Shelley. Their neighbors were a family named Newton. The lady and girls of that family were also particularly fond of Shelley. Wherever Shelley went, he was welcomed by children.</p>
<p>What was reflected in the eyes of the women was not only Shelley's beauty and talent, but also his jade-like nature. But they did not observe that he was selfless, generous, and desireless. Godwin's daughters called him "rascal" and "king of sperm"; the Newton girls called him "empty sperm" and "king of material sperm."</p>
<p>No one knew when he would come to visit. When he came, he would rush in like a gust of wind. Then he would become excited and tell stories incessantly. But while telling a story, he would suddenly start talking about his philosophical theories, denouncing the ideal society. In this way, without realizing it, the east was already dawning, and he would accompany the girls to go for a walk in the street.</p>
<p>A year or two after the marriage, the nature of the "hotel girl" appeared in Harriet. Her love of listening to Shelley's poems and philosophy was only an effort. What she loved in her nature was beautiful clothes and luxurious social gatherings. While her husband, who was talking about poetry all night, was away, she went out to play with many bad boyfriends.

<p>Movie News</p>
<h3>"National Soul" with Many Refugees</h3>
<p>Allstarcast's work "Daughter's Classic" has been widely welcomed by audiences. In order to cater to the needs of people in society, Star Film Company has also produced this film "National Soul" with anti-imperialism as its theme, in which all the performing stars cooperate. It also interspersed a section on the historical facts of Xu Xilin assassinating Enming and overthrowing the Manchu Qing dynasty's national revolution, hoping to arouse the public's anti-imperialist sentiment and recover the lost territory of the Northeast.</p>
<p>A scene of the film being shot at a refugee camp a few days ago, with hundreds of extras crowding the entire outdoor studio, brought the suffering of the vast number of refugees to the screen. Gao Zhanfei, Xi Jianong, Zheng Xiaoqiu, and others gave up their homes and bravely and enthusiastically led the vast number of refugees to the front lines of anti-imperialism. The director of this scene is Cheng Bugao.</p>
<h3>Gu Menghu's Acting Summary</h3>
<p>A successful actor cannot only have one aspect of acting, but it is also difficult to have the opportunity to develop as many aspects of his acting as possible in a play. Recently, Gu Menghu has gotten such an opportunity. He appeared in "Autumn Fan Mingdeng", starting as a student, then becoming a prodigal son, and eventually becoming a prisoner, and then a beggar. These several stages undoubtedly contain both upright and villainous styles, soft and hard performances, which is a summary of one aspect of acting. One can even say it is a complete acting compendium.</p>
<h3>Yihua Tidbits</h3>
<p>The script of "Hero of the Times," written by Ying Yunwei, has passed the re-examination.</p>
<p>Rumors that Tang Na will play the leading role in a new film by a certain company are untrue.</p>
<p>Yuan Congmei has lost five and a half pounds since directing "Storm."</p>
<p>Hollywood has Mae West; China has Ye Juanjuan. Ye Juanjuan's "hot" expression in "The Beginning of Man" is the same as Mae West's style in "I'm No Angel."</p>
<p>Zheng Yingshi has abandoned the script of "The Adventures of a Poor Boy" and has compiled a new script, which has been sent to Beijing for inspection.</p>
<p>In Yihua's outdoor studio, the old Zhabei street store scenery has recently been built. Excluding labor, the material cost alone has cost more than four thousand yuan. It is prepared for the use in the play "The Beginning of Man." It is said that this scenery will not be demolished in the future, but will be burned to ashes, because there is also a cause and effect in it.</p>
<p>Little star Chen Juanjuan has excellent acting skills in "The Beginning of Man."</p>
<p>Wu Liuyan, known as the "Wine Immortal," plays a drunkard in Yuan Congmei's "Storm."</p>
<p>Wei Heling has recently suffered from back pain, but still "forcefully acts."</p>
<p>Zhang Zhizhi makes a cameo appearance as a foreman in "Storm."</p>
<p>Fatty Guan was slapped many times in "The Beginning of Man," more than two dozen times in total. The most wonderful thing is that he told the woman who slapped him to hit him hard, because only by hitting hard could his expression be profound. As a result, Fatty Guan's cheeks were red and swollen for three days.</p>
<p>Bu Wancang has returned from vacation, and "Victory Song" continues to work.</p>
<p>"Hero of the Times" will start working on the set as soon as "The Beginning of Man" is completely finished, and the leading actor is being selected carefully.</p>
<h3>Li Amao Opens a Grain Store</h3>
<p>Xu Zhuodai, the answerer of the Li Amao mailbox in the New Evening News, has recently made a cameo appearance in a rather humorous role in the sound film "Victory Song" directed by Bu Wancang at Yihua Company. His dialogues have the same humor and wit as his answers to questioners in the Li Amao mailbox.</p>
<p>The current Xu Zhuodai is a figure in the news world, but one must know that the Xu Zhuodai of a few years ago was a very famous figure in the drama world. Therefore, he can use his experience in the drama world in the past to appear on the screen.</p>
<p>In "The Fairy in the World," he played a wealthy man who specializes in pursuing women on behalf of modern society; in "The Night Before the Wedding," he played a male gold digger. Now, in "Victory Song," he is the owner of a rural grain store.</p>
