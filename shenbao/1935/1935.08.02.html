<h3 id="c14">悼惠廉博士 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— 昂</p>
<p>美國密蘇里大學新聞學院院長惠廉博士。以七十衰翁。抱病數月。竟於七月二十九日在其本國之哥倫比亞。溘然長逝。惠廉博士畢生從事於新聞事業。學問道德足爲舉世模範。其門人遍天下。我國之留美習新聞學者。尤多受其敎益。博士三度遊華。對於我國新聞事業。關懷至切。滬津等處若干報紙。曾蒙指示。而有所改進。北平燕京大學之創設新聞學院。博士亦與有力。今者吾人驟聞噩耗。殊不能無黯然之哀思也。</p>
<p>惠廉博士自高等學校畢業後。卽投身報界。初任報館手民。旋升記者。歷主若干地方報紙筆政。一九〇八年由密蘇里日報公會推任密蘇里大學新聞學院院長。其後又任該大學校長。今春以衰老多病。不克兼顧。始辭校長職務。單獨主持其手創之新聞學院。博士畢生心力。盡瘁於新聞事業。嘗謂從事新聞事業者應以此爲終身事業。不應視此爲獵官致富之捷徑。年前民主黨一再欲。推博士爲密蘇里州長候選人。彼均固辭。羅斯福總統就職伊始。華盛頓方面有以惠廉博士任駐華公使之議。但博士又以不願晚年入仕途而婉謝。可見其所信之堅而所行之篤矣。</p>
<p>惠廉博士人格之偉大。學識之淵博。在新聞學方面。固不僅爲美國之導師。抑亦全世界之導師。今者不幸謝世。自爲新聞界之莫大損失。吾人於哀悼之餘。願就博士所手訂之「記者信條。」摘記大意。爲吾輩從事於新聞事業者勗。</p>
<p>「記者信條」乃惠廉博士一生敎學思想之結晶。其關於寫作及編輯者。如曰。「簡潔之思想及簡潔之陳述。確實及公正。爲高尚新聞學之基本要素。」又曰。「心所謂眞。筆之於書。非爲社會福利而隱蔽新聞者。不可恕。」關於記者及報紙之品格者。如曰。「君子所不爲者記者亦不爲之。以自己之爲財行賄。與以他人之錢財行賄。均所不取。」又日。「廣吿·新聞·及評論。均應以讀者最高尚之利益爲前提。」又曰。「最成功之新聞事業應畏天敬人。獨立不倚富貴不淫。威武不屈。建設的容忍的但决不疏忽。能自制。不操切。恒以讀者爲懷。但絕不畏縮。見不義卽憤。愛國而不忘敦忘邦交。是爲今世人道的新聞學。」又曰。「公衆之日報爲公衆之信托事業。從事於此之一切人員則爲受公衆之信托者。有於公衆服務一點稍虧厥職者。卽爲此種信托之叛徒。」凡此所云。均足資吾人深省焉。</p>

<p>（東京）本日閣議决定任命松岡洋右爲滿鐵總裁、請求日皇裁可、明日正式發令、同時改革滿鐵職制、新設最高顧問、以松方幸次郎任其職務、（一日日聯社電）</p>
<p>（東京）滿鐵公司總裁林博太郎三十一日晨會見岡田首相提出辭表、政府採用關東軍司令官南大將意見、决以松岡洋右繼任其職、岡田首相於本日與松岡正式交涉就職事宜、得其允諾、卽行發令、松岡業於三十一日晚到東京入其自宅、其接受首相就任總裁之提議殆已確定、關東軍當局擬新設外交顧問一職、任命松岡兼任該職、滿鐵總裁史迭後、副總裁亦將調更、現任滿鐵理事宇佐美昇任副總裁之說最有力、</p>
<p>政府今次起用松岡洋右繼任滿鐵總裁、其內幕略有如次事情、卽南大將本年初奉命就關東軍司令官赴任之際、對岡田首相及林陸相力說建設日滿經濟聯盟之最大急務、並表示其有重大决意實現此計劃、又關於滿鐵改組問題、南林兩大將意見完全一致、正待其機會之到來、至今廢止滿洲治外法權之準備工作着着進行、日滿經濟共同委員會設立恊定亦成立、於是實行滿鐵改組之時期已到、南司令官認實行改組之前、應先調換總裁、於是决定推舉曾在日內瓦國聯大會爲日本退盟問題活躍之松岡洋右、南氏就任司令官當時旣有起用松岡之决意、然松岡以環境不適爲理由、謝絕就職、現今周圍一切工作全部完成、機會旣熟、南氏起用松岡之意志遂見實現矣、</p>
<p>松岡洋右曾任滿鐵理事及副總裁、縱橫發揮其靈敏手段、其所計劃之滿蒙鐵路網計劃現已成功、且滿鐵管轄滿洲全國鐵路及中東路、以與軍部有好感情之松岡爲其總裁、將來開發經濟實業及發展華北經濟之手段、殊堪注目云、（一日日聯電）</p>

<p>（東京）滿鐵總裁之更迭早在豫料之中、林陸相於渡滿時曾與南司令官懇談此事、歸京後得岡田首相之諒解、决定起用松岡洋右、陸軍所以推薦松岡者、以松岡以前曾任滿鐵副總裁、精通滿鐵實情、今後須與華北實現經濟提携、其總裁必須如松岡有外交手腕之人物、方能應付、由此見地、故力薦松岡、且松岡與軍部情感甚佳、卽南司令官亦熱心推舉、此為重要原因、氏就任後、或着手懸案中之滿鐵改組、目下則應現地之狀勢、完全以白紙之態度臨之、（一日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）林滿鐵總裁之更迭、已屢次傳說、近始實現、林總裁係內由康哉伯由滿鐵總裁轉任外相時繼其後任者、與現地關東軍之關係素欠圓滿、反之、八田副總裁與關東軍關係比較密切、故林總裁早已不安於位、兼之林總裁前次入京訪問高橋藏相、關於華北投資問題協議滿鐵應採之方針時、藏相暗中表示反對之意、謂滿鐵向華北活動、須絕對愼重、但現地之狀勢、完全與藏相之意見相反、益使林總裁陷於進退兩難、南司令官到滿就任後、確立日滿經濟團體、行將改組滿鐵、於是外與軍部內與八田副總裁關係益欠圓滿、故林總裁遂下此最後之决心、至於松岡洋右之起用、林陸相渡滿時、南司令官曾言及之林陸相對於滿鐵之人事、以從南司令官之意向爲方針、故亦力保松岡云、（一日電　電）</p>
<p>（東京）松岡洋右昨夜由御殿塲歸京、在自宅語記者曰、余與滿洲不知有何姻緣、關係素深、至今日止、己四次違反本人意志、服務滿洲、前任滿鐵副總裁、卽其好例、余現在無不可離之事、卽政黨解消聯盟、其基礎已大體成立、余雖離此赴滿亦無困難、總裁問題俟政府前來交涉時、回答之、但亦難保無意外之事、原來人生位置、有一瞬卽變者、卽如僕年五十、仍不能例外、（一日電通電）</p>

<p>（東京）此次陸軍之定期異動、部內外於發表前均非常注意、對於犧牲眞崎大將與秦中將、謂係林陸相已達統制强化軍之目的、其他雖未使社會注意、但分配膽力兼備之人材於各要職、得鞏固正攻法陣容之處、實可謂為得宜、新陣容之主要者乃石原大佐之參謀本部課長、今統石原氏將爲參謀本部之核心而活躍、又對陸軍心臟之軍務局軍事課長任用武藤中佐、滿蒙班長任用影佐中佐、更引用柳田中佐及其他等、實可謂爲絕佳之措置云、（一日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）日陸軍省今日正式發表全陸軍之官佐調動命令、關於此次之調動、事前曾起大風波、則林陸相之調動案、受眞崎敎育總監之大反對、秦中將之待命問題為衝突之主要點、據東報載稱、此次之大調動、係欲恢復滿洲事變後已失之部內統制、杜　陸軍內之朋黨行動、並取適材適所主義、以期陸軍之強化、關於林陸相此次調動、各界批評如左、</p>
<p>（一）上下兩院之批評</p>
<p>自五一五案靑年軍殺犬養首相以來、軍部之上層毫無統制、　使下層之將校支配全陸軍、至少亦予世間有此種感想、國民從來對軍部均抱尊敬、信賴及親愛之情感、而靑年軍官竟以秘密出版及各種文書、使國貪及國民起畏怖、社會不安之大部從此而生、由尊敬信賴親愛而變爲恐怖、所以此次之調動、可以减少大半之社會不安、此事比齋藤岡田兩內閣、對於政治的動向、予國民之影響更爲偉大、林陸相重責已盡其犬半、値人注目者還是今後之指導勢力問題、</p>
<p>（二）報紙之批評關於此次之調動、　京各大報紙多稱讚林陸相之英斷、素稱爲軍部之喇叭之東京日日新聞云、今次之調動還有美中不足之感、菱刈松井兩大將之待命中、松井大將之待命令人感意爲意料之外、（讀賣新聞亦作同樣之記載、並謂林陸相對松井之行動、係出於揮淚斬馬謖、）因松井大將在陸軍部外組織大亞細亞主義協會、作種種之政治行動、致受各界之誤會、竟被認爲有紊亂統制而被迫勇退、其實松井其贊助林陸相之統制、松井所以不得不退者、爲林陸相考慮眞崎退　之勢力均衡、竟爲其犧牲、秦中將之待命爲今次調動中、國民所抱發大關心者、秦在憲兵司令職中之行動、早已有許多風說、眞崎大將勇　之後、秦自然站不住、統制派之建川小磯兩中將及東條少將、原定進出中央、結果仍留在地方、說是並非林陸相之本心、部內亦引以爲憾、或堪稱爲美中之不足、至於滿洲事變之功勞者石原大佐任參謀本部之作戰課長、關東軍謀石本大佐之任調查班長、影佐武官調任陸軍省軍事課滿蒙班長、花谷中任關東軍參謀等、均爲淸年軍官派之重用、亦爲林陸相第四回調動案之白眉、十二月之定期調動將爲林陸相之人事政策之點晴工作云、</p>
<p>（三）社會民主主義者之批評社會民主主義者之機關報時局新聞云此次之調動並非西斯派之退却、實為偽裝强硬派之敗退、其要旨謂、眞崎大將之辭職、如果認爲法西斯派之退卻、則錯誤偽裝强硬派之巨魁、在實質上全陸軍更加硬化、如滿變之石原大佐任作戰課長、影佐中佐之滿蒙班長、石本中佐任調查班長等、陸軍之最强硬派已進出中央部、陸軍此後之動向、將爲此等中堅階級所决定、此與花谷中佐重任關東軍參謀相對照、其趨勢更可令人注意、（一日華聯電）</p>

<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄（宗海）譯</p>
<p>那所房子裏似乎充塞了童子們，他們正以各種娛樂方法消度運微雨的黃昏。分明地童子們是充塞了各處，『樓上，樓下，以及女東家的房裏，』因爲從幾處開着的門可以見到羣羣快樂的大童子，小童子，以及不大不小的童子，都　從事各種消遣，雖然各式不同，其結果都巳是十分喧鬧。右面兩個大房間顯然是敎室，因爲這裏祗見課桌，地圖，黑版和書籍散佈着。爐上燃着熊熊的火，幾個懶意的男孩子竟仰臥在墻壁火爐旁邊，在討論一個新的球戲場，興奮得祗見他們的靴子在空中亂舞。一個高高的靑年卻儘自在一個裏練習吹簫，毫不為他四周的喧鬧所擾亂。另外有兩三個在跨桌子，問或停歇下來，透一口氣，更有一個小滑稽家，以他們全體同伴爲對象，作了幾幅詼諧的漫畫，引起了不少的笑樂。</p>
<p>左邊一間房裏擺了一個長長的餐桌，上面已放着幾大瓶新鮮的牛奶，幾堆黃的和白的麵包，更有耀目的薑汁餅，整整齊齊堆稍着，這些在童子的心靈裏，是何等的珍貴啊，空氣裏忽然聞到一些烘麵包的香氣，又加雜了焙蘋菓的氣息，這些又怎能不引惹着一個機餓的小肚子和小鼻子呢？</p>
<p>不過最使他欣慕的景物，卻還在那門內的小開裏，即樓梯間裏。在這裏的最上層，種拔河的競技，是在活潑地進行着，某一叚的上頂平台是用作石子戲的塲所，另一個用作棋盤，至於各個階梯上，則有一個男童在讀書，一個女童對牠的囡囡兒唱着催眠曲，二隻小狗，一隻小貓，一連串的小男孩沿着扶梯滑下來，也不管這件事是大不利於他們的衣服，並且也容易危及他們的肢體呢。</p>

<p>市長致詞</p>
<p>吳市長致開會詞云、主席團、各位先生、各位小朋友、今天是國定兒童年開幕、全上海兒童代表在此慶祝兄童年之開幕、上海市民認爲莫大之榮幸、因爲兒童年是上海市提議、經國民政府核定、二十四年度爲國定兒童年、自今天起至明年七月三十一日止、全國各地行政機關各公團在此一年中、要努力提倡努力推行兒童的事業、兄童是中華民族的種子、是延綿中華民族之生命的、中華民族前途之興衰、全在今日中國兒童之有無希望而定、今日兒童之有無希望、其責任在今日之父母、今日之社會及政府、政府社會父母要負敎養兒童的責任、所以國府定今年爲兒童年、就是要給全國國民以慈幼觀念、同時使兒童知道本身地位之重要、中國對於民族觀念太淺、對於家族觀念太深、如能拿對家族打算的觀念、轉移爲民族打算、相信中華民族不會有今日之遭遇、即有今日之遭遇、亦可打破此困難、最不幸的是全國人民到今日還是祗爲家一族打算、而不爲整個民族打算、故雖有四萬萬五千萬人、佔全世界人口四分之一、還是　少數民族來壓迫、欺侮和支配、這道理即是四萬萬五千萬人等於盤散沙、毫無團結、祗爲個人家族打算、不爲整個民族打算、這是第一個原因、第一個原因是我們祇知傳種、不知培養種子、人多不受教育、有何月處、反而被人少而受敎育的民族壓迫、欺侮和支配、我們因不知培養、祗知傳種、故人多不能發生人多的力量、韓非子說、愚民百萬、謂之無民、即是斯理、古語云不孝有三，無後爲大、我們即爲一家傳後、如不敎養、即變成敗家子、爲民族傳後、如沒有智識、即變成亡國種、故今後之政府社會父母負敎養兒童之責任、使不僅興發一家、同時復興民族、否則不負責敎養即成敗家子亡國種、所以我們在這國定兒童年中不但要努力提倡和推行兒童事業、同時要喚起全國人民注意、對兒童有新的觀念、喚起全國兒童注意、使認識今日兒童、即中國將來的主人翁、是繼續中華民族生命的份子、要自己重視地位、所以今日全市兒童代表在此慶祝兒童年開幕、意義即在此、市府關於兒童事業在可能範圍內一定要努力推行、尤其關於貧民兒童事業、市府已計劃在建築三千間平民住宅、在貧民新村中有簡易治療所、及小學校、兒童樂園·兒童寄托所等、使貧苦兒童、有適當敎養、但兒童事業是偉大的、非政府獨力所可辦到、希望社會人士、一致努力推行云、</p>
<p>蔡氏演說</p>
<p>市黨部代表蔡洪田演說、略謂、今天是國定兒童年開始一天、兒童是民族的根基、我們對於兒童的敎養保護、必須特別注意、因此政府規定二十四年爲國定兒童年、今天舉行開幕典禮、即要把兒童事業從今天起開始推行、兒童是將來國家的主人翁、我們要培養兒童有工匠的精神、使將來保護國家、如工匠保護房屋園亭樣、但要培養其工匠的精神、須鍜鍊健全的體格、和灌輸豐富的智識云、</p>
<p>兒童答詞</p>
<p>（一）西成小學陳珠庭答詞云、諸位小朋友、今天是兒童年開幕的一天、是最值得紀念的一天、是市長和各機關長官費了很多的精神和財力、才有今日的典禮、我們應如何感議、我們兒童是人類社會的中心、必須愛護社會國家以至於人類、對社會國家　　服務的貴任、方而希望社會人士的　挈、方而要我們自己努力云、（二）商務印書　童工陳　通云、各位夾賓、今天以兒童代表的資格上來貢獻意兌、非常榮辛、政府規定兒童年、及今天舉行隆重典禮、是有重大的意義、完全是改良我們的環境、提高我們的生活、現在的兒童即將來的成人、輕視現在的兒童、即　視將來的成人要國家强盛、一定要有强有力的兒童產生强有力的成人、來担負重大責任、今天我們兒童一方感謝政府之重視、同時我們自己要用功讀書、鍛鍊身體、服用國貨、實行新生活運動云、（三）夏令兒童健康營沈濟川云、各位先生、各位同學、在現在時期誰也不能否認、今日兒童是將來國家的主人翁、但我們要用功讀書、鍜鍊體格、將來才能担負起主人翁來、希望大家致努力、將來國家的强弱全在我們身上云、</p>

<p>私立中學聯會代表堅欲索敎部指示原電</p>
<p>（北平特訊）北平市男女合校問題、愈鬧愈大、市政府堅持不准男女同學、訓令社會局轉飭各私立中學嚴厲取締男女合校、私立中學聯合會呈敎育部、請制止平市當局取締男女合校、以免與中學規程衝突、私立中學聯合會今日在中山公園開秘密會　討論進一步之辦法但事實尙未成功以前、儀決案絕對嚴守秘密、敎育部態度尤堪注意、現秋中方而、甚盼敎部有所指示、以便早日解决糾紛、而市府方面、則始終抱定「取締男女合校一之主　、故一時不易解紛爭、茲分誌各方情形如次、</p>
<p>敎育部態度</p>
<p>北平男女合校糾紛發生一星期後、敎育部曾電北平敎育當局、有所指示、社會局因某種關係、未將原電公佈、僅表示敎部對男女分校問題、原則上巳贊同、私中代表則謂敎部並未贊同市當局之主張、私中聯合會前曾電敎部、請維持男女同校原案、刻敎部已有批令到平、原文錄下、一呈悉、查此案近據社會局呈送方案到部、當經予以詳細指示、仰靜候該局遵令辦理可也、此批、一私中聯合會對於敎部原電所謂一予以詳細指示、」及「仰靜候該局遵令辦理』兩點、表示疑問、故有向社會局素閱敎育部原電之必要、但社會局截至發稿時止、尙未允予閱電、究竟眞相如何、仍無從探悉、</p>

<p>— 蘇欽</p>
<p>在夏天里，到玄武湖，會使人錯覺時節是初秋的。到處是一片濃綠，到處是密層層的樹陰，景色總是那樣幽沉，四限的房尾也靜默得沒有人聲。</p>
<p>可是，你要說它太鬱悶，太冷落麼，却又不是。看，那邊的湖上，不是有許多孩子和女人們在划着船兒麽？那邊的茶座上，還不是擁着幾十來個，百來個人麽？不過，聽不着譁噪聲音罷了。</p>
<p>靠着豐潤門的城根，盡是淸冽的湖水。不知名的水草，當你划槳時擦過去，夾在新生的荷葉和初放的荷花中間，飄在水面，微微的抖動一下。那種粗綫條的媚態，你總得欣賞的。</p>
<p>再不然，你揀着一個晴明的下午，如果你不怕太陽的話，跑到鷄鳴寺的樓上，或者，簡直走到臺城上去，你對玄武湖作一個閒淡的眺望。你看見那遠遠的蔣山，岡巒起伏的，一片紫金色的峯影，好像直撲到湖心里去。那種偉壯的而又奇秀的景緻，你去想像吧。</p>
<p>那時，那豪邁的奔放的情緒，是你所獨有，雖然太陽晒得你滿身是汗。在春天或者是秋天，這眺望並非不可以去做，但春天的時候，湖里的倒影沒有濃重的色彩，秋天的時候，湖上又太蕭條，只有夏天，有這樣的奇趣。</p>
<p>至於月夜下的湖景，我倒想不談。倘然你有「月夜游湖」的經騐，總可知道一些。乾脆說，比較夫子廟夜市中和秦淮河上，多少有不同的趣味吧。要是在星光下，或許更好些。因爲夜景是迷離的，那周圍並不多大的淺水湖，會使你感覺是茫茫的大海，前途是那樣黑森森的　一片，一片。</p>

<p>因爲那撫台老爺自從奉了上諭，充軍往黑龍江去之後，不久便在那邊死了；他的家屬雖說還是很平安地留在他的家鄉，可是他的財產已全部給太后抄沒了，所餘的至多只能維持一家人的日用，再加所有的人都知道他們是罪人的家屬，不免很輕視他們，不特無從再得富貴，簡直到處還要丟臉。</p>
<p>記得兩三年之前，其時距離滿淸的覆亡巳有二十多年了，我正在上海，有一天，無意中走進一家綢緞公司去選了幾段衣料，當塲因爲不便自己携回去，便寫下了我的姓名和住址，要他們打發人給我送來。晚上，他們果然派了一個位置很低的夥訐把東西送來了，這人却很古怪，待我收了東西，還不就退出去，紅着臉向我問道：</p>
<p>「夫人以前是不是在宮裏頭住過的嗎？」</p>
<p>這一問當然是使我很詫異的，但我實在也無須隱瞞，便立卽點頭應承，接着他就繼續的告訴我，說他自己當初也是一個做官的人家的子弟，並且和我家是世交，可是二十多年來無日不處於很艱窘的境地中，加以人人都在旁邊訕笑着，使他們不能再有出頭的日子，以致他自己才因無可如何而流落爲綢緞店的小夥計。</p>
<p>我聽他說了姓氏，便恍然大悟？原來他就是當初給太后充軍往黑龍江去的那個作惡的巡撫的小兒子；想不到事情已經隔了二十多年，而太后所給予伊那叛臣的公正的處罰，却兀是不曾失效，依舊像昨天才發生的一樣！（三七九）</p>

<h3 id="c167">全世界注目的一胎五兒 <a href="#c167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>加拿大盎太里沃地方，有居民狄盎尼氏之妻，去年一胎生了五兒，在臨產的時候，自然非常艱難，幸虧名醫達福博士手術高妙，五個胎兒都安然下地，產母也平安無恙。胎產生五兒，兒體自然比尋常嬰兒弱小，所以在最初幾個月，極難　育，但經醫士特别保護，居然個個長得玉雪可念，現在已經一歲多了。原來盎太里沃政府因爲一胎五兒，是世界上希有之事，生怕他們父母保養不周，難獲安全，所以在五兒下地之　，便商得他們父母的同意，歸國家養育。在他們父母寓所不遠，造了一所極合衛生的育兒所，聘了專門看護基里林夫人並幾位助手專任保養，還派了兩名精幹的警察，日夜守衛，以防意外損害。</p>
<p>狄盎尼夫婦家道素寒，近來竟有人向他們運動，把五兒向當局收回，借以賺錢，所得的錢，八成歸狄氏夫婦，經理人只取其餘一成，並且還對狄氏夫婦說道：「你們倘若有個金鑛，政府能否奪了去呢？自然許你們隨意開採，那末，你們五個孩子，政府怎麽有權奪了去呢」？盎太里沃的公共幸福大臣克羅爾氏和他的同僚聽了這話，却大不爲然，克氏說：「這五個孩子，不能和金鑛相比，這是科學歷史上所未有的事，加拿大視爲國瑞，政府有神聖義務保護這五個和世界有關係的小寶貝，阻止被人利用，損害他們的安全。無論如何，不能讓他們離開現在適合衛生的住所，作爲奇物供人觀看。」</p>
<p>自從五兒生下之後，一時轟動全國，再加五兒生得活潑可愛，所以社會士女，人人希望一觀，以飽眼福起初經保護人商妥，每逢星期日下午二時到三時，許人隔着玻璃窗觀看，這個消息傳出之後，人人爭先恐後，每次來看的，總有四五百人，但是現在已不許人看了。因爲這九個小孩已稍懂人事，他們見許多陌生人擠在窗外，擾擾攘攘的張望，也睜圓了小眼，向外注視，因此夜裏睡時，發生神經上的反動，頗不安寗，所以達福醫士便命連星期日也不許人觀看，同時對於稍能妨害五兒幸福的事情，一槪禁絕。但是五兒的父母仍可自由探望，他們的母親並可和五兒嬉戲，帮助洗澡穿衣等事，自前五兒的身體，雖極壯健，但據達福醫士的意見，五兒都是未臨月便產生的，所以今後幾個月，還須特別小心保養，才能一帆風順</p>
<p>這五個小孩，現在已能咿晤說話，在地爬行，他們終日聚在，處，互相玩笑，使人見了那滑稽狀態，站着數小時，也不生厭。他們面貌相似，使人很容易認錯，他們每晨五時，便醒在床上，呀呀地唱着，用小手嬸弄，並且由喉中發出種聲音，好像催看護替他們換衣服似的。早晚洗浴一次，在水中能拍水遊戲，他們進食之後，換好衣服，便由看護抱置廊下小車之中，聽他們或玩或睡，到午時再行進食，一到晚間七時，便一齊入睡。據未任看護基里林夫人聲稱，這五個孩子，很爲幽默，若你給他們吃不喜歡的東西，他們會假裝有病的神氣，他們常常用眼角瞧着你，是否注意他們，若是你去抱他們，他們便哈哈大笑，撲在你的身上，眞令人可愛啊！</p>
<p>這五個孩子，幸虧有手術高妙的達福醫士替他們接生，還有注重兒童幸福的政府，小心將護，否則我們常常聽見一胎一兒，但總是生下便死了，或生下幾天便死了，一胎五兒，能保養得個個身體壯健，這不能不算世上的奇聞了</p>

<p>在喝茶的時候，他眉毛動了兩動，這就放下茶杯來笑道，據程先生看，這件事怎麽樣？志前道：我有一個笑話，可以打比。聽說冤屈死了的鬼，一定要找一個替身，然後……浣花不等他說完，就紅了臉笑道：是的，爲了把他的媒作成功，賈先生才都助我一筆火車費，我得以回江南去。好像捉住了這朱姑娘當替身。其實這采姑娘是非嫁不可的，我就不作媒，他也要嫁人。而且我在西安，幹的是什麽？他現在有了主子，不愁穿，不愁吃，和我的情形，那可又大不相同了。志前眼看他許久，沒有作聲。覺得他那不粘脂粉的皮膚上，今天却透出了一片紅量。便想到了月英的臉子，却在健康的顏色中，透市了一綫蒼白。天下事就是這樣，永遠的相反而相成，浣花見他老是這樣的看着，倒有些不好意思，勉强的鎮定着道：我也知道程先生是很喜歡那姑娘的，但是我們出來作媒的時候，你總不肯說要。志前連連搖着手笑道：差之遠矣，差之遠矣！說到這裏，我們就放下這　事不談罷。浣花又喝了兩口茶，眼睛注視了茶杯子裏頭，因道：我還不能算走得了呢。明天這裏有一輛到潼關去的汽車，賈先生說好了，讓人家帶我去。另外給了十幾塊錢，也就只好剛買張三等車票，說不定，還是不够。路上就算不吃不喝，若出一點什麽小事，我零錢都拿不出來，這怎麽敢放膽走。（二七九）</p>

<p>前列各價尙好一角左右　金短遠期而下跌勢突起</p>

<p>紗市續挫、漸現不安、忽升忽降、殊乏把握、此種情形、完全因一般投機商之心思不定、忽而買進、忽而放出、據市塲上傳言、某方面之多額、在近月稍有出籠、於是附和者搶先了結、同時現紗益覺岑寂、市盤愈跌愈熾、</p>
<p>金鷄狂瀉兩元外</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、因上日一般同業大量購進、看漲心思狂熱、頭盤近漲一元外、遠漲七·八角二盤形勢仍緊、又高七·八角、拍至三盤、聞現紗交易淸澹、且做開日紗佔多數、收盤忽然狂落、市塲情形大變、因某方面之主持者、將自已之多額一·二·千包、獲利吐出、一時消息走露、人心震盪、一般附和者羣爭了結、市盤狂瀉二元外、結果本月比上日收盤價漲三角、遠跌一元一·四角、午後開盤、市塲依然衰弱、塲中傳說多頭吐出、消息利於空方、而長豐又來拋出、包額殊巨、有三千餘包、箱面大爲鬆濫、結果本月比上日跌二元、遠跌八·九角至一元三角、查賣出大豐一千包、通記九百包、明德一千二百包振大八百五十包、合興五百包、仁豐一千四百包永昌九百包、永大六百包、長豐三千五百五十包、潤康一千一百包、慎裕七百包、買進錦昌一千八百包、達記九百包、慎記二千包、益昶二千四一百五十包、潤康七百包、賡豐一千三百包、瑞大四百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>
<p>現銷祇有五百餘包</p>
<p>現紗銷路清光澹、查全日各幫買去統計五百五十三包、各幫買額如下、</p>

<p>美棉同業買進趨跌</p>
<p>昨美棉開盤、因同業買進十月、賣戶缺乏、市況平靜而堅、各月漲一至四磅音、新棉借欵消息不定、同業乃候華盛頓方面之聲明、天氣及收成消息均形順利、現需呆滯、廠存不多、午後股市及麥市有力、本地　補空、利物浦拋售吸多頭了結之額、均爲吸收、最後空頭抵補、華盛頓買進漲風又起、計現貨漲十磅音、期貨漲十至十六磅音、印棉交易不多、散戶及大衆略有買進、計平果爾漲半羅比、奧姆辣漲〇·二五羅比、白羅溪漲〇·五至〇·七五羅比、原電錄左、（三十一日電）</p>

<p>自由談雜論「十日談」  孟加　　十四世紀的意大利，在經濟狀態上巳遙遠地超過但丁的時代，特別是在佛羅稜斯，這種資本主義萌芽期的經濟關係更表現得異常明顯，因而產生出了職人，商人，船員，以及其他的都市小有產者等新的社會集團。意大利新興文化的確立，中世的詩歌樣式，但丁的「神曲」—那種充滿着唯心的象徵心義，濃烈的禁慾主義的氣氛，那種以爲「地上的生活是悲嘆和罪障之淵谷，凡是地上的東西都是架空的。人生之主義與目的，是包含於一切地上物之否定中，宗敎中，神之靜觀中，」而在其中閃爍着敎會之偉大的師父們，修道院的始視們底嚴肅的姿影的封建的，敎會文化的詩篇，已經不適於新內容的成長，而爲散文小說所代替了。在這一意味上，薄伽丘（Boccacio的「十日談」Decameron），自然會代替了「神曲」的地位。　　當然，我們决不能忽視那被但丁創造於成長的新文化環境中的「神曲」的特徵，—如以「個性」爲人生的中心，及其反乎中世詩歌之不拘束的荒唐無稽的幻夢性，而在這一莊重的象徵的唯心的藝術搆成中透洩出現實主義創作方法的嫩芽等等—然而但丁的「神曲」，在其主要的內容上說，還是中世紀末期人間社會底精神的形式表現，是精神的靈的生活底記錄，它描寫着帝王，法王，騎士，聖者，謳歌禁慾主義的精神，極端鄙夷一切肉的享樂，以爲地上的愛慾是罪惡，對於虛僞的僧侶的「崇高」還是衷心思慕讚美的。由此，我們之確定但丁的「神曲」是封建的宗敎文化的詩篇，是不爲過言的。　　和這相反，意大利現實主義文學史上的第一人薄伽丘則在其「十日談」中，大膽地宣佈肉慾的快樂乃是人類之自然的權利，謳歌着物質和肉慾，確信那些只要一披上袈裟便以爲在事實巳與一切世俗的東西絕緣的人們，只是「一些傻子」，他以肉慾的快樂是人類自然的權利，這一敎義來和敎會的禁慾主義相對立，他頗痛切地嘲笑愚劣的僧侶社會的虛偽，他把他們描寫成欺騙者和「愚蠢的俗物」，他把這些「血色滿面長得異常肥滿，像雄鷄般揚着一鷄冠，傲慢地挺着胸脯行走，一自身連耳朶都浸在罪惡里向，却又偏偏板起那天國的主人面扎，視金額的多少而把天國的地方和主的祝福分給人們「高貴的」僧侶們，描寫成使人發笑的像現在咱們中國那些鼻頭抹粉却又掛着長鬚扮老生唱高調的丑角。他剝落了僧侶們的假面具，—在口頭提倡禁慾主義，如何崇高的把它說得天花亂墜，而却又在自己的房里暗藏着酒和種種香料，給予以致命的辛辣的諷刺。他描寫着那些由赤貧而暴富的富於冒險的精神和元氣的常時商人們的氣質，描寫着這些新社會階層的世態心理，及其肉慾的，物質的日常生活。其作品之一切士人翁，不管他們地位的高低，都是因肉體的健康和現世的悅樂而感到興奮，感到新生的歡喜—在此處我們可以聽得出「那在物質的滿足中生活着的人們，從黑暗的幻影和痛苦的悔恨的壓迫中解放出來的人們，並不將希望繫在神及天使們的身上。而完全繫在自己的聰明，發明，繫在自己的能力和胃險心」，總之，繫在自己對於新的生路的開拓的豐滿的潑刺的生命力上的人們底健康的笑聲·這種感到生的歡喜而發生的愉悅的洪浪的笑聲，正像晨曦剛出時的鷄啼聲一般，宣告了薪時代的來臨·在這一點上「十日談」的調子是和「神曲」那種抒情詩的哀調截然不同，典型地表現著兩個截然不同其命運的階級的感情的。　　關於「十日談」的形式、我們可以說是一種卑俗的，即從藝衛的意味上說，是不完整的瑣碎的。在一百篇故事中，雖然說主題是多樣而豐滿的，但它所採用是一種說話的講故事方式，因而在故事的發展過程上及其藝術的構成上，是缺少一種嚴整性和建築學性的。故事的主人翁的性格是不明顯的，平面的，非生動的，同時在心理描寫上也是不深刻的，因此，薄伽丘在「十日談」雖然宜布了新的社會層的誕生，却並不曾完美地描寫出這種新人物底典型，在點上，薄伽丘是僅抽象地平面地表現出一種新興社會集團的人生觀而不曾具體地在其現實生活上，在其活躍的動作上，在其內心的精神生活上表現出這些新的典型底整個姿態，這該是最主要的一個原因吧。然而薄伽丘之利用並深刻化其以前的意大利的「具有幻想內容的極短小的故事」這種型式而使之確立其在意大利一文學史上的地位，及其主張以自我爲中心，以全然不含有象一徵意味的「現實的事件及現實的人物」來代替了以前的宗敎的對於「天國」的思慕和幻想的詩篇中，那種富於抽象性寓意性的人物這一點上，他將可以說得是最初的舊現實主義文學家吧。在這里，我們之强調着薄伽丘的偉大性，與其說是為了他的可驚的形式洗鍊，優美，及藝術的完整性，母寗說是爲了他的創作方法之劃期的性質，爲了他的是最初的舊現實主義文學家，爲了是他開拓意大利乃至於歐洲的現實主義文學的第一人吧。夜過丹徒  沈聖時　　火車拉着啞嗓子吼了一聲，從山洞裏爬出來了。　　一片山村的夜景。　　一座座黑壓壓的茅屋，排列在山坡上。偶而有茅屋的木板窗內漏出一點兩點黃澄的燈光。　　深靜的午夜裏，蛙聲像擊着一面脆薄的皮鼓，從村舍的草塘裏透起來。　　一天像輕紗縐疊的雲彩，擁着一彎下弦月，月亮領着一羣活躍的星星，悠舒地在天際緩緩遊過去。　　火車像一條巨大的怪獸，喘着吼聲，從一片悄靜幽寂的郊原上爬過去。　　洶湧的江水，翻着浪；月光悄靜的倒映在江水上，遠遠一片燈光，一炷炷映在水心跳動。　　我凝神望着，車窗外初夏的夜景，火車載着我的心，從一片淸靜的月光的郊野上滑過去。　　擊着一枝紙烟，我默默體味着夜的幽味；下弦月悄然地昇上中天，再打窗口望時，丹徒的原野早在車窗口飛逝過去了。賭塲里  李三郎　　——東方的蒙特卡羅散記之一　　囂張的，這兒充塞了緊張而鬰悶底氣息，雖然澳門是靠着巨浪的大海之濱，一排一列的賭塲的旗子在海濱上給海風飄揚，然而，一跨進賭塲里，就好像埋進了地獄里似的，從沒有享受到一點的新鮮底氣息。　　里面高掛着白皚皚的燈光，奪目的，然而，因爲塲里的人們盡是有勁兒或耐心地抽香烟的緣故，一股一股的白灰色的烟圈子向上散開充塞着小小的廳子里，會給人家懷疑，這不他人底世界，而是魔鬼底世界了。、　　人，雜混的，有的穿着華麗的公子，或有錢的商人底樣子，有的却只穿着破壞的衣裳，毫不分彼此的混在一塊兒，團團地圍着長方形的檯子里。又好像一羣飢餓的羔羊等候人家把食物塞進他們的嘴巴里一樣的，張着狂大的慾望的眼珠子他們的臉孔盡是在跳躍與痙攣地跟時間的秒針而動着。　　在夏天，這兒有的是猛烈底電風扇，然而，無論怎麼在沒有太陽的南方的賭塲里，總是悒鬱與炎烈的。人們淌着汗，但是，眼睛還是定定地的迷在攤手的動作里，或是檯子上四方格上的金錢或鈔票上面。好像連自己底生命也忘記了似的，盡是犧牲在劍刀一樣的金錢底權威里了。　　在冬天，這兒雖沒有暖氣機，但是假如穿了厚厚的衣裳，進來的時候，總會熬不住悶熱的要把衣裳除了開來。實在，這兒永遠是道樣的，一種不是太陽的炎烈而是可怕的悶熱底氣息。　　這兒沒有白天和夜里的區分，這兒有的是耐心的賭徒，也許從早上就埋着腦袋在賭塲里，金錢的使者會把他的腦袋浸上了不醒的藥，會一直的不知疲乏與飢餓的捱過了白天，又挨到黑暗的夜里，高掛在壁上的時鐘好像成爲虛僞的影子似的，從來沒有一個眞正的賭徒會注意到時辰的溜過去的。這樣他們熬過了白天，又捱過了黑夜，雖然他們贏得他的本錢十倍百倍以上，然而，無論怎麼的突然暴富了起來，他們依然貪婪地，忘記了自己的生命似的沈醉下去，一直等到所有的金錢又安穩地溜到別人的手里的時候，他午才帶著咀咒和悔恨的心，疲乏的身子，昏亂的腦袋，一擺一拐地跨出了門檻，他們又設法等到一些欵子，縱使是賣妻賣子，也都只爲了賭的慾望而犧牲的。也有些聰明的賭徒，在這兒贏了一大筆金錢的時候，就跑到艷麗的女子底圈子里，把他們的生命迷醉着，等到他們巳沒有生的可能的時候，就悄悄地跳進了黑的海濤里。或是做了流氓，實在到這兒來的從沒有一個好果的人，只有把人的生命浸在毒藥里。　　東方的蒙特卡羅的澳門永遠是這樣不息地輾轉着的呀！太行山的一角（上）  蘆焚　　天氣晴朗，三兩朶白雲在遠處山腰間移動，山色蒼靑，襯得雲的白色竟無可比擬，太陽光愉快的照着山林村落，昨夜的露氣尙未消盡。汲水人將桶放進池裏，發出淙—的一聲響，濺出淸亮的水珠。娘婦在池邊浣衣，一面笑語；孩子驅羊到山上去，不停的抽着響鞭。驢不時引吭大呌，猪仔蹣跚着在道傍走過。四圍是這樣甜蜜蜜的寗靜淸和，催人欲醉！　　呌作「老弟」的人倍我到市鎭盡頭的小山上去，不消說，我懷着不少奇異的念頭，聽他同居民一路打招呼。　　爬到山頂，「老弟」還在山脚下立着，正同一個人閒話什麼。那人約摸四十歲左右年紀，頭剃得很光，衣灰袍，脇下佩帶着手槍，說不淸是那一流人物。不似痞棍，也不是紳士，却鑲着一顆光亮的金牙齒，在居民中總還算文雅的，他不遠的後面還立着一個靑年漢子，臉刮得像剛割過的一片草地，而臉色只是靑暗，並不見什麽光彩。他生得很出色，似乎發聲喊就可以同狼賽跑的。一雙眼怔怔的，放出殘酷的光芒，表示他要殺人或者被害，樣子生得利落的像一匹小獸。他肩頭荷着一杆德國「僧帽牌」的步槍，我聯想到戰壕裏的兵丁。　　那漢子從容的摘下槍枝，毫無目的放了一響。這似乎是一件平常事。一羣馱子正從他身邊經過，鈴鐸得冬得冬響着，騾同驢搖了搖大耳朶，趕鴃人仍然抽着響鞭。擔水人擺動着身子，極淸潔的水花潑在地上。誰也不暇顧那槍聲的走過去了。　　據「老弟」說，剛才同他說話的是一個地主，弟兄三人分居，一天夜裏，長兄的一家八口被一位卸任區長宰了一個光，而只因爲祖先們的一點小怨隙。現在徙居在這鎭上，那漢子是他家佃戶又兼充保鑣。大學時代（三六）  德國施托謨著陳隱之譯　　我也看見了『土伯爵』，他像疲乏樣子，盤着腿坐在大廳另一邊。—我站在他近旁。當音樂家拿起樂器時候，一個年輕學生走到他面前來。『讓我這次同娜麗跳舞可以麽？』他胆怯地說。『下一次吧，「後輩」！「土伯爵」回答，并把他那美好而蒼白的頭靠牆仰着。昔樂開始了，但他幷沒有站起來去邀請他的女舞伴，祇懶懶地舉起手，用旨頭向他故固手勢。我看見他用一種憤怒的眼光向他飄過來，然後把眼睛掩在那隻支起的手內，沒有立起身來。『土伯爵』皺起額頭，過一會之後才起身，走過大廳，直到她面前站着。—此時她旣然沒有抬起頭來，他便用臂膀圍繞她并用一種迅速的運重把她抱起來。他似說了兩句氣憤的記，那時我站得太遠，不能够聽得出來。然後他攙挽她站在其餘各對跳舞人前頭，并開始跳舞。　　她已經是身裁甚高的姑娘了，但腦殼祇及他的胸前。我長久地注視他們；她頭向後仰，身子彷彿祇靠他手臂支持一樣，僅用足尖接觸着地板；他低下頭看她，他那像鷙鳥般眼睛不動地注視她的面孔，這面孔是閉起眼皮對着他的。跳舞完後，他送她到她的坐位去並讓她輕輕地從手臂裏滑落到椅子上。　　這次休息得並不長久。不久全廳起了一陣紛擾，音樂奏出急速的調子，跳舞的人迅速地一對對配列起來。　　跳舞又開始了，笑聲和放縱的喊聲佈滿了整偭圈子；我看見那些輕鬆的小脚一急一次地從那些黑斑上面滑過去。愈轉愈快，到最一次週旋舞時，因爲轉得過快了，那些可憐的孩子們一定會跌倒地下的。　　然後，音樂突然一下停止了；當學生們跨過她們身上笑着走開時候，那些舞女們才紅起面孔從地板爬起來，抹過額上頭髮，或者打落她們費了好多勞力得來的舞衣上面的灰塵，我不知道，這究竟是由於小孩子搗亂性底殘餘呢，還是由於一切人們本有的衛動，要對那不能脫離其魔力的東西表示一種反抗？似乎這些大學生又覺得他們對於女性的侮辱還做得不充分了　　我的眼睛總沒有離開娜麗，她們祇孤獨地坐在「土伯爵」送她去的那個坐位上。她似乎壓制着自己，使得在那次跳舞中沒有人來邀請她同舞。　　不久之後，人們又莊嚴持重地跳起『對舞』來，彷彿故意表示同那次跳舞相反的性質。此時我就同一個相識走進側房去。我們碰見許多老學生，不久各人面前放着一杯啤酒了，我們便大談特談關於這次考試能有甚麽結果的事情。　　當隔壁音樂停止時候，還有幾對跳舞的人走近我們，坐在棹子旁邊。『土伯爵』和娜麗也在他們中間。街頭夏景之一呌哥哥  天基小品文與敎育  欽文　　如果文學的確是「敎養」的；小品文至少有一大部分具備文學的要素，那末同敎育有着關係，是不成問題的了。而且，在文學的範圍內，同敎育的關係，小品文還比小說和劇本等來得密切；不說別的，只要一查敎科書和活葉文選，無論是那個書局出版的，可知小品文的篇數，都比小說和劇本的多；在古文方面，總也選着許多篇「雜說」。這固然因爲小品文短巧，容易使得學生了解而感趣味；也因爲小品文是精練的，句句有勁，處處出色醒目，能够於無形中引起學生嘗試的慾望，不象小說和劇本，要長長的整篇讀完，才可以領會作意；如果只看得一部分，有些地方難免莫名其妙，覺得平凡無味，在課堂裏是不便把長篇大頁的作品一氣讀畢的，所以小品文占了優勝的地位。　　上面只對課本而說，其實小品文，也很適宜於課外的閱課；簡單明了，便於自修：娓娓動人，看了一點以後，自然會得不忍釋手；「歷史小品」，「科學小品」，不但在文字有益，對於各種功課也都有用，可謂「補助敎育」的利器。且更有功於「社會敎育」，這從一般報章雜誌刋載小品文的多，便可以明了。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言上海又要舉行盂蘭盆會了  行安　　陰曆七月又降臨了，上海人又在鬧着舉行孟蘭盆會。上海人居住在這全國唯一的通商大埠，得世界風氣之先，照理習俗應該變換一點。實情却不然。民國改曆，已由政府三令五申，厲行了好幾年，上海人仍然陽奉陰違，過其陰曆的新年。國慶國恥日儘可以不必揭國旗，一逢迎神賽會，他們就不能不興高彩烈的出來參加。現時孟蘭盆會之期到了，上海人不免又要忙碌一番，大打其醮。這幾天，上海一班游手好閒之徒，正在各處大活動，挨戶捐錢，提倡盛會。各馬路各里衖，亦張燈結綵，準備熱鬧。上海人的迷信心，眞是牢不可破。　　自然，上海人的舉行孟蘭盆會，也自有其愚不可及的用意，爲的是祈求地方的太平。其實依我看，上海地方的太平，已經是太平得可以了。目前各省大水泛濫，幾十萬災民，正陷於水深火熱之中，號天哭地。這種不太平的景象，才夠你傷心慘目！然而對於這，上海人恐怕就熟視無睹，不關痛癢了。　　先日馬相伯先生，發出一勸告國人節約拯災書，爲災民請命。我以爲國人能眞正發動惻隱之心，節衣儉食，慷慨解囊的，一定不多。因爲這直接就影響及個人生活。還是上海人把這一個月要打醮的無用糜費，節省起來，捐到災區去助拯。倒是一件功德無量之舉！救濟活人，豈不比超度死人，慈善得多。不過我的提議，也是一種奢望？說不定上海人大都抱着災民可以不救，醮不可以不打的决心。　　那麼這陋俗，就有取締的必要了。昨聞社會局以本市舉行盂蘭盆會，實屬提倡迷信，勞民傷財，莫此爲甚，當此各省水災慘酷，災民待救孔殷，豈宜以血汗之金錢，作無益之消耗，應設法取締，以挽頽風，業於日前派員會商公安局，除由兩局會銜佈告外，並由公安局備令通飭所屬，一體從嚴查禁云。且看今年上海的太平公醮是怎樣。磨刀人  村因　　我的一把小刀子銹壞了。　　爲了沒功夫去磨銳它，所以請了一個磨剪刀的老頭子來替我做這件工作。　　那個老頭子的衣裳，是褸襤得好像一頭在街上亂奔的沒有歸宿的野狗的枯毛。他的臉孔上，滿攀着筋攀。頷下的一堆灰色的短鬚，時時隨着二瓣紅白的嘴層翁動；從他的二顆沒神的眼珠里衡量下來，眞不知他會遭到過幾許的不幸呢。　　他接受了我的那把小刀子後，便跨到他自己的那棹狹長的骯髒的凳子上去。細細地把小刀子看了一看，皺着二條蒼老的眉毛，萬難似的說：　　「先生，七個銅板吧！眞不容易磨呢。」　　這句話，顯明是想向我多要幾個銅子而已。他的態度，非常誠摯，非常畏縮。由於他的模樣兒可憐的緣故吧，我一點兒不遲疑的允諾了。　　「這把刀子的鋼，倒很好！先生。　　裝了個笑臉，他這樣　懃地來向我說話，使我不好意思起來啦。「何必這樣呢，老頭子，我拿出的是錢，而你費去的是氣力！何必這樣獻慇懃呢，我們的交換是多麼公平呵。……」想這樣跟他說，一時給一個什麼意識阻止住了。只得在自己的臉孔上，報復了一個微笑給他。　　於是，一塊磚頭上，喀咕喀咕地饗了。（我的小刀子在它上面徘徊的聲音呵。）　　他的枯色的筋肉，着胸裸的前，幾根骨頭，黃的皮，全跟隨着這喀咕喀咕的怪刺心的聲音蠕動了。我似乎看見一架破舊而過時的機器。　　站在旁邊，瞧着這架活的機器的一仰一後的動着，有些不耐煩了。我到了他的耳朶上的一個圓小的洞，很是奇異的，就問他：　　「耳朶上的洞，生得眞奇怪吓。」　　「是的，那已經有四五年了。」他的那種沉苦的聲音，是沒有悠長的氣息的。他的憐憫的眼珠，旋過來看了我一眼後，就把眼珠投向雙手推動動着的小刀子的身上去。接着，獨自個兒喃喃地向着那把在磚頭上徘徊着的小刀于，說：「那一年，我住的地方開始了戰爭。—先生，我們江北人，苦命的太多了。—兵隊一排一排的，打我的草屋前經過，後來，我們聽到了槍聲，砲聲。後來，我們看見了滿天的紅光，四週的房屋，還有我們的一徘草屋也都給兵士們燒掉了。我們逃命！我們想逃出這種可怕的地方，我們踏着還在呻吟的屍體，我們的鞋子給地上流的血浸濕了，我們逃命吓！就在那個時候，我的耳朶邊穿過了一粒彌子。當時，我一點都不覺着痛，及到息下來，躲在一個陰溝裏的時候，才發覺肩上的衣服都給血水浸濕了。…」　　他的手停止了，他的腦袋也抬了起來。他對我嚴厲的看了一看，瘋一般的說：　　「那時死了倒也干淨呢，先生。省得吃這樣苦了。」　　「你太幸運了，你還有氣力，你不會吃苦的。」我只能這樣去安慰他，除了這個，我還能說些什麼呢？說的話雖然多極了，可是一時又給一個什麼意識阻止住啦。太苦痛了，我不能把我的話直截地說出來。　　喀咕喀咕的聲音遲緩了。他把我的那把小刀子已經磨得很明亮很銳利。　　「這樣好麼，先生。這麼快的刀子，可以殺死許多我們的仇敵呢。」　　」你也懂得仇敵嗎？」這麼地我諷刺似的說着。　　他苦笑了，沒回答。　　付了他七個銅板，背起了那棹凳子，背起了無限的苦痛。我們大家都苦笑着分開。分開了呵！受難女  劍碧　　她在尼菴裏十年的內心經騐，比她唸經穆拜尤爲重要，以前不崇敬任何宗教的思想在目前她認爲絕大的荒謬，因爲由「絕大的荒謬」而生出了「懺悔行好事」的志願，她現在是祈禱，苦行，痛悔唸經以求得救。但人的意志終是薄弱的，經不住強力的誘惑，在十年之內沒有事，在十一年的春天她又受到懲罰般地被神擲出於苦修得道之門外。　　「任你有堅強的意志總克服不了自然的衝動的呀！」馬丁路德的話又很確切地告訴她的行爲的必然性。　　生活於波浪起伏似的環境裏，二十年人世的冷熱味，回憶中的辛酸佔有一大半，對於她自己莫可解釋的生活史，一頁頁全濺滿了血淚，一頁頁全是荒謬　　難耐的寂寞逼她理智地信仰了宗教，祖代母代的頌經膜拜於香霧中，現在是笑她們的聰明而鞭打着愚蠢了的她自己，祖父的娶妾，父親的外遇原是促成祖代母代的信仰「神的理由」了；至於她自己，那母寗說由於愛得太多而反覺得空虛來得確當吧！</p>

<p>然而尼菴究竟是佛者聖地，拼命克制情感以寄託於木魚各各聲中的不能持久，她明暸其所以了，於是某一篇故事她想起來，那是種花匠男子一個人被衆尼集中目的的所由來，靜止的心湖跳動了起來。　　在一個淸朗的月夜，在銀白色的月光吻着滿地樹蔭時，當春夜溫情的愛神拍着輕翅降臨時，她輕微地吟着一首名詩：　　「力量與生命已遠遠的飛去了，　　朋友是沒有了，歡樂是死了；　　從前餧養的榮譽也去了，　　信仰是在我脆弱的星上了。　　人們短促的生命的時問，是沒有結果的。　　所有生命所紛予我的好東西，　　乃是安慰我淚的心的洪永，　　所有的東西都要回到塵土中去，　　除了那齊整秀幽的美的東西—大自然的春夜。」　　像小說中描寫着的逼眞，動人，神奇地的，由黑暗的屋角邊探出一個頭，細聲地：　　「親愛的，走吧！時候差小多了，火車已輾動着輪子，聽吧……」　　兩個影子惶張地印在月光的大地上，男人的帽子像一柄小傘那麽，在月亮下移動着。　　從此她又一次的蒙塵世之難於以後今子曰店（風物篇之一）  秦鑒　　天氣像燒一樣的熱起來，蟬兒又在樹枝上殺豬般地叫噪了；這時候，在充寒着無量數的尋求生活的靈魂的都會裏，在街角的牆上，夾雜在調經丸與戲院廣告的招貼中，一些狹小而歪斜的「弄堂小學」的秋季招生廣告，又將成堆地出現了；它們，到處張貼着，散發着，用了「普及敎育，减收學費，隨到隨考」等動人的，迎合的字樣，來代替了商店的「優待顧客，薄利多賣。」　　於是，走在街上，走在住家與商店繁盛的區域中，在一條條的街子裏，在醫生或命相館箏的招牌中，人是很容易找出一個小學的牌子來的，在那兒，附近的居民，那些過着不甚舒適的生活的居民，便在就近興便利經濟的原則下，化了六七塊錢一學期的學費，便把自己的孩子們送去作爲主顧的一分子了。在那兒他們是被敎育着，被訓導着，被形成着，像一片被仍（不，被託咐）在一爿劣等的木匠店裏的缺乏營養與關心的，流浪的小木片一樣，生活着，長成着。　　在住家繁盛而地點適中」的任何一條衖子裏，盤算一下，人可以租下一所住宅房子來，讓客堂做了校長辦公室，樓上下的二個廂房隔做四個敎室，（也許要辦完全小學罷？但也不妨，可以採取「複式敎育法」，而實行「併班制的啊），把上下的亭子問作爲校長與敎員的宿舍；最後，餘下的一個樓中間——寫了一張召租，租給人家，撈回點血本不算，如果那未來的房客也有孩子的話，不是又多了點學生，不是一切事務辦起來也許會更順利，更「平穩」了嗎……？　　於是，在這惹大的都會中，在這擠塞着大最的人口的繁盛區域中，我們就看得到那種近代化了的「子曰店」了。從那裏，人可以看到：從客堂到扶梯口的小道是被標作「民生路的，大門的進口是定作「博愛路」的天井是被利用作健身房與操塲的，年靑的敎員在生活的指使下，從半生不熟的敎育中落了下來，從平靜的故鄉（然而，現在是已經衰落得不可想像的了）裏像探險般地走出來，從細微，甚至像學徒式的苛刻的待遇中，用打雜差式的勞動去換取一二滴艱難的生活；每天做着八九小時的工作，從常識到體育音樂，從國文到英語與勞作。此外，改卷子，劃表格，這些是全得放在校中所僅有的二三個敎員身上的；校長，下了本錢，劃辦了「事業」，他不是早夜地在打算一點錢，一點經費的嗎？日夜地在盤算：怎樣，改良」，怎樣做廣告，怎樣……可是，現在的世界，什麽車都不容易，就連辦敎育」都難了！要立案，要設備，敎員又吵着索取欠薪，這些，在他（校長）看來全是不容易辦到的事情；先說，那麼簡陋的設備，難道還華立案嗎？再說，付給敎員的薪水，也是一件困難的事情！爲了一家的生活，祗得勉强地敷衍着這一家「子曰店」，要不，又有什麽事情可以做得呢？他自己是挺明白自己的。　　然而，一切都不好辦啊！就是連這一點：小「店」的存在都似乎不再能長久地延續下去了；市面那麼不好，人家也把大部分的注意力放到找尋生活的上面去，而對於孩子們的「上學堂」的事情已經沒有多大的能力了，也許……　　也許，只有在牆上多貼幾張招生廣告了吧。竹嗡嗡（下）  天鵠　　他引起了我的注意，我呆立了半天，我覺得這時他的心裏一定很酸苦，他的眼光裏含有羞恧與强悍的意味，他在覺出我注視他的時侯，又傻笑了一下，帶着痛苦的臉去了。　　黃昏，我到老坤和茶館裏買包紙烟去，巧的，小火根也踁踱的走在前面，他也走到了坤和茶館裏。　　老坤和先看了我，笑着對我道；『靑叔叔，叨你的福，這次我好玩從城裏催了十隻竹嗡嗡來，你那天給四小哥買去了一隻，村裏的幾個「小拆天」都來買了，到今天已只存一隻了，你們會掙錢的隨便起什末利市都好！呵呵！」　　我正想答話，忽地從身邊發出一種細弱的聲音，「買嗡嗡……」，　　側轉頭一看，却是小火根，塡起了脚跟爬在櫃口上，老坤和他異常似的翻了翻眼皮，他看淸楚了這吊眼的小孩懷疑地問：「你要買嗎？」　　「買一只……」小火根從破衣袋裏摸出了幾油膩的銅子，塞到櫃上，重用凝視的目光，睨着那架上僅勝的一副竹嗡嗡。　　「想勿穿……」老坤和似乎欲對這個無知的孩子說出許多他所活了這末大年紀經騐下底諷刺一個不知高下的人的話，一種流活的感覺很快的推動了我，我便笑着道：「你把這個給了吧，錢我來給。」　　老坤和用勢利的手法把那竹嗡嗡伸到小火根面前道：「小拆天，也算你有額角，拿去吧！」　　可是小火根他沒有接受他用陷深的眼光對我看了看，那不可形容的臉一橫，搶過了自己的銅子，「唔」的一下走出去了。　　帶着沉壓的心，回出到家去，在塲外田埂上，見圍着一羣人，當我上去看時，啊，是一件可怕的事啊！　　小火根給寶龍的爺抓住着，他顫悚的手裏拿着個竹嗡嗡，寶龍在一邊拭着臉哭，寶龍爺咬着牙指着他在說：「你爺娘不見得養你做小强盜吧，你搶了人家的東西還要打人，叫你爺娘出來評理。」　　這是所襲擊着我腦殼的，不是眼前的情形，我忍着悽痛的神思上前去拉開了寶生的爺的手，我想仔細對小火根詢問幾句，可是僅僅當我的手按在他的頭上時，他已掩面痛哭起來了。播音節目歌唱　　夜鶯藝社　　中華（一一四〇）下午四時一刻至五時　　龍翔鳳舞（前奏曲）喜相逢（曼娜）鮮花新婚（露茜）風雨歸舟（流朗）窮富姻緣（綠茵）人間仙子（曼娜）戀愛明星（露茜）　　敦本（八〇〇）下午八時至九時　　夜鶯曲（前奏曲）人面桃花（曼娜）雙料情人（綠茵）求愛秘訣（露茜）我的愛人就是你（曼娜王蝶）吹泡泡（綠茵）戰地之花（露茜）　　星星歌唱社　　新新（七八〇）下午六時至七時　　重返故鄉（玲琍）抗敵歌（飛亞飛虹）新催眠曲（白燕）浮雲掩月（飛亞）淸早起來（玲琍）紙窗夜雨（飛虹）紅顏軍士（白燕）穴衣曲（飛虹）　　美玲團　　航業（一一八〇）下午六時至七時　　舞伴之歌（前奏曲）大路歌（全體）節儉歌（程英英）妹妹我怪你（程瑩）等一等吧（黃韻）漁村之樂（程英英）舟中曲（程瑩）再見吧故鄉（黃韻）永遠親愛（頓玲）　　李樹德（九四）下午六點十分到七點　　「雜景談話」　　飛音社　　中西（一〇四〇）下午六時至七時　　娘子軍（俞月明）我不能忘記你（姚瑤）鳳陽花鼓（姚莉）新木蘭詞（佈德）鳳求凰（俞月明）回憶（姚瑤）粉紅色的夢（姚荷）滿江紅（佈德）　　玫瑰團　　東方（一〇二〇）下午六時十分至七時　　舟中曲（前奏）人間仙子（文仙）新鳳陽歌（張如）好妹妹（吳芳）賣花女（曼麗）我的愛人就是你（文仙）喜相逢（張如）新婚之夜（玲玲）　　市音（一三四〇）下午八時一刻至九時　　三潭印月（前奏）心琴曲（文仙）擱樓上小姐（吳芳）風雨歸舟（玲玲）芭蕉葉上詩（曼麗）勇士凱歌（張如）光明之路（全體）麗華我眞需要你（張如）　　利利（一二四〇）下午十時十分至十一時　　小桃紅（前奏）紅顏軍士（張如）太平花（玲玲）妹妹我怪你（文仙）粉紅色的夢（吳芳）淸早起來（張如）摩登小姐（玲玲）愛神的箭（曼麗）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Breach in the Yutai Embankment: Water Flows South in Two Streams; Feng and Pei Counties Simultaneously Alerted; Shao Hanyuan Orders Strict Defense; Han Sends Zhang Honglie to Tengji to Summon County Magistrates for a Meeting <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) Special Commissioner's Office News: The breach in the Yutai Embankment has caused the water to flow south in two streams, simultaneously alerting Feng and Pei counties. Special Commissioner Shao has issued orders to strictly defend. Investigations reveal that the Yutai Embankment is too close to the shore of Nanyang Lake, causing it to be breached by the surging lake water. Whether there will be a large Yellow River water flow later is still difficult to predict. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Feng County telegraphed this afternoon that the water from the breach in the western Yutai Embankment is flowing directly towards northern Feng, at a speed of approximately three to four *li* per hour. The leading edge of the water has entered Feng territory, and northern Feng is suddenly facing a critical situation. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Pei County urgently telegraphed the Special Commissioner's Office this morning, reporting that the breach in the Yutai Embankment near the Qianzhuang area is causing the water to flow directly into northern Pei. It has now reached a point seven *li* north of Longguji, with the water level at one meter high. The situation in northern Pei is serious. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Shao Hanyuan went to Lijiaba this afternoon to inspect the sluice gate. The construction of the dam has been completed. After Shao's inspection, he returned to Xuzhou that evening and telegraphed the provincial authorities requesting funds to install the gate, in order to complete the project. Wang Gongyu also went to Lanjia Dam again to supervise the construction of the Jingshan transverse embankment and to comfort the people. The provincial government sent Jiang Zhankui from the Grand Canal flood control area to Xuzhou to discuss the plans for the Shuangzha sluice gates at the Wenhu estuary with the Special Commissioner's Office. As the location of the gate is in southern Shandong, negotiations with the Shandong side are still being planned. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Chen Guofu and Shen Baixian replied by telegram to the various agencies in Xuzhou, stating that they originally intended to personally come to Xuzhou to offer encouragement for the construction of embankments for Yellow River flood control, but due to simultaneous flood alerts in various parts of the province, it is difficult to leave temporarily. A flood control area has been established in Tongshan, under the responsibility of Special Commissioner Shao, with Technician Yu assigned by the provincial government to assist in the planning. It is hoped that everyone will provide assistance for the project to proceed. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Special Commissioner Shao Hanyuan, in order to explain the construction of embankments in northern Jiangsu and the plugging of the breach in western Shandong, recently telegraphed Commissioner Wang Guanjun of Jining, stating that the scope of the embankment construction is limited to western Hubei, and the embankment site is more than twenty *li* away from the lake shore, which is far from the lake embankments of Zhaoyang and Lianghu in southwestern Shandong. Not only will it not forcibly suppress the nature of the water, but it will also increase the capacity of Weishan Lake. Yesterday, the magistrate of Heze County inspected the embankment and his doubts were dispelled. Furthermore, he knows that the only way to resolve the crisis in western Shandong is to quickly plug the breach, which has nothing to do with the western embankment of Weishan Lake. If the breach is not plugged, the disaster in Shandong will worsen day by day, and northern Jiangsu will inevitably follow suit. At this time, the only option is to cooperate sincerely to promote the early closure of the breach, which would be fortunate for both provinces. As for the breach plugging project, assistance will be provided to the best of our ability within the possible scope. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han believes that since the Yellow River breach has not been plugged and Jiangsu is building embankments, the water has nowhere to go, and the disaster area will expand further. The diversion and rescue of various rivers and lakes in western and southern Shandong is extremely important. He has now specially dispatched Construction Department Head Zhang Honglie with technical personnel to Teng County to summon the magistrates of Zou, Teng, Yi, Zi, and Yang counties for a meeting, and to Jining to summon the magistrates of Jinxiang, Yutai, Chengwu, Juye, and Jiaxiang counties for a meeting to discuss flood prevention and rescue measures. After the merging of the five and six Yellow River breaches, the total width is 1,876 meters. The remaining four breach mouths have been silted up and have no water, with a total width of 345 meters. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) A tributary of the Grand Canal in Dongping breached at Dajia Pavilion, flooding more than 60 villages and sending water directly to Wenshang. Today, more disaster victims are transported north on two trains via the Jibei Canal, where the water has risen and the embankments have collapsed in Wucheng. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Jining telephone report: On the 1st at noon, two streams of Ziyang water flowed into Jining, entering the territory from Jinqitun in the northeast. The leading edge of the water is two *chi* deep and two *li* wide, flooding Malou, Zhao Zhuang, and other places. Efforts are being made to plug the breach. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Yongding River Water Recedes <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Yongding River water level was nine *chi* and five *cun* this morning. It dropped another five *cun* at 1 PM, and remained at nine *chi* until 8 PM. The water flow is stable. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lugouqiao telephone report: The Yongding River's Huilongmiao water level was one *zhang* on the 1st, a decrease of five *cun* compared to the 31st. The submerged flats are nearly full.

<h3 id="e14">In Memory of Dr. Walter Williams <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Ang</p>
<p>Dr. Walter Williams, Dean of the School of Journalism at the University of Missouri in the United States, passed away on July 29th at the age of seventy in Columbia, his home country, after battling illness for several months. Dr. Williams dedicated his life to journalism, and his scholarship and morality serve as a model for the world. His students are all over the world, and many Chinese students studying journalism in the United States have benefited from his teachings. Dr. Williams visited China three times and was deeply concerned about China's journalistic endeavors. Several newspapers in Shanghai and Tianjin have improved due to his guidance. Dr. Williams also played a significant role in the establishment of the School of Journalism at Yenching University in Beiping. Today, we are suddenly saddened by the news of his passing and cannot help but feel a deep sense of sorrow.</p>
<p>After graduating from university, Dr. Williams immediately entered the newspaper industry. He initially worked as a typesetter in a newspaper office and then rose to become a reporter. He successively served as the editor of several local newspapers. In 1908, he was recommended by the Missouri Daily Newspaper Association to serve as the Dean of the School of Journalism at the University of Missouri. Later, he also served as the President of the University. This spring, due to old age and illness, he was unable to manage both positions and resigned from the presidency to focus solely on the School of Journalism that he had founded. Dr. Williams dedicated his life and energy to journalism. He believed that those engaged in journalism should treat it as a lifelong career and not regard it as a shortcut to obtaining official positions and wealth. Years ago, the Democratic Party repeatedly wanted to nominate Dr. Williams as a candidate for Governor of Missouri, but he firmly declined. When President Roosevelt took office, there was a proposal from Washington to appoint Dr. Williams as the Minister to China, but Dr. Williams again declined, not wishing to enter officialdom in his later years. This shows the strength of his beliefs and the sincerity of his actions.</p>
<p>Dr. Williams' great personality and profound knowledge made him not only a teacher of journalism in the United States, but also a teacher of the world. Today, his unfortunate passing is a great loss to the journalistic community. In addition to mourning him, we would like to extract the main points of the "Journalist's Creed" he drafted as an encouragement to those of us engaged in journalism.</p>
<p>The "Journalist's Creed" is the culmination of Dr. Williams' lifelong teaching philosophy. Regarding writing and editing, it states: "Clarity of thought and clarity of statement, accuracy and fairness, are fundamental to good journalism." It also states: "What the heart believes to be true, write it down. Those who conceal news, except for the welfare of society, are inexcusable." Regarding the character of reporters and newspapers, it states: "What a gentleman does not do, a reporter should not do either. Bribery with one's own money, as well as bribery with the money of others, is unacceptable." It also states: "Advertisements, news, and commentary should all be based on the highest interests of the reader." It also states: "The most successful journalism should fear Heaven and respect people, be independent and unyielding to wealth and power, be constructive, tolerant but never negligent, be able to control itself, not be hasty, always keep the reader in mind, but never shrink back, be angry at injustice, love the country but not forget the importance of international relations, and be a humane journalism for the present age." It also states: "A public daily is a public trust. All personnel engaged in this are trustees of the public. Anyone who neglects their duty to the public is a traitor to this trust." All of this is worthy of our deep reflection.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Cabinet decided today to appoint Yosuke Matsuoka as President of the South Manchuria Railway and requested imperial sanction. The official order will be issued tomorrow. At the same time, the South Manchuria Railway's system will be reformed, and a new position of Supreme Advisor will be established, with Kojiro Matsukata appointed to that position. (1st Day Japanese Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) President of the South Manchuria Railway Company, Hirotaro Hayashi, met with Prime Minister Okada on the morning of the 31st and submitted his resignation. The government has adopted the opinion of Commander of the Kwantung Army, General Minami, and decided to have Yosuke Matsuoka succeed him. Prime Minister Okada formally negotiated the matter of assuming office with Matsuoka today and obtained his consent. An official order will be issued immediately. Matsuoka arrived in Tokyo at his home on the evening of the 31st. His acceptance of the Prime Minister's proposal to assume the presidency is almost certain. The Kwantung Army authorities plan to establish a new position of Foreign Affairs Advisor and appoint Matsuoka to concurrently hold that position. After the stepping down of the South Manchuria Railway President, the Vice President will also be replaced. There are strong rumors that the current Director of the South Manchuria Railway, Noboru Usami, will be promoted to Vice President.</p>
<p>The government's current appointment of Yosuke Matsuoka as President of the South Manchuria Railway has the following background: When General Minami was ordered to assume office as Commander of the Kwantung Army at the beginning of this year, he strongly advocated to Prime Minister Okada and Army Minister Hayashi the urgent need to establish a Japanese-Manchurian economic alliance and expressed his strong determination to realize this plan. Regarding the reorganization of the South Manchuria Railway, the opinions of Generals Minami and Hayashi were completely consistent, and they were waiting for the opportunity to arrive. To date, preparations for the abolition of extraterritoriality in Manchuria are steadily progressing, and the agreement to establish the Japanese-Manchurian Economic Joint Committee has also been established. Thus, the time to implement the reorganization of the South Manchuria Railway has arrived. Commander Minami believes that before implementing the reorganization, the President should first be replaced. Therefore, it was decided to recommend Yosuke Matsuoka, who was active in the League of Nations General Assembly in Geneva regarding the issue of Japan's withdrawal from the League. When Mr. Minami assumed office as Commander, he already had the intention of appointing Matsuoka. However, Matsuoka declined the position, citing an unsuitable environment. Now that all surrounding work has been completed and the opportunity is ripe, Mr. Minami's will to appoint Matsuoka has been realized.</p>
<p>Yosuke Matsuoka has served as a director and vice president of the South Manchuria Railway and has brilliantly demonstrated his agile skills. His planned Manchurian-Mongolian railway network plan has now been successful. Furthermore, with the South Manchuria Railway managing the entire Manchurian railway and the Chinese Eastern Railway, having Matsuoka, who has a good relationship with the military, as its president will draw significant attention to future means of developing economic enterprises and expanding the North China economy.

<h3 id="e16">Inside Story of the Change of Presidents of the South Manchuria Railway; The Key Lies Entirely in the Military's Strategy <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The change of presidents of the South Manchuria Railway was expected long ago. Army Minister Hayashi had a candid discussion with Commander Minami on this matter when he traveled to Manchuria. After returning to Tokyo, he obtained Prime Minister Okada's understanding and decided to appoint Yosuke Matsuoka. The reason why the army recommended Matsuoka is that Matsuoka had previously served as Vice President of the South Manchuria Railway, is well-versed in the actual situation of the South Manchuria Railway, and needs to realize economic cooperation with North China in the future. The President must be a person with diplomatic skills like Matsuoka in order to cope. From this point of view, Matsuoka was strongly recommended. Moreover, Matsuoka has a very good relationship with the military. Commander Minami is also enthusiastic about recommending him, which is an important reason. After taking office, he may begin the reorganization of the South Manchuria Railway, which is a pending issue. For the time being, he should face the situation in the field with a completely blank slate attitude. (1st Day Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The change of presidents of the South Manchuria Railway, which has been rumored many times, has finally been realized recently. President Hayashi was the one who succeeded Count Yuko Uchida as Foreign Minister when he transferred from President of the South Manchuria Railway. His relationship with the Kwantung Army in the field was not satisfactory. On the other hand, Vice President Hatta had a relatively close relationship with the Kwantung Army, so President Hayashi had long felt insecure in his position. In addition, when President Hayashi visited Finance Minister Takahashi in Tokyo last time to discuss the policy that the South Manchuria Railway should adopt regarding investment in North China, the Finance Minister secretly expressed his opposition, saying that the South Manchuria Railway's activities in North China must be absolutely cautious. However, the situation in the field is completely contrary to the Finance Minister's opinion, which further made President Hayashi feel caught in a dilemma. After Commander Minami arrived in Manchuria to establish the Japanese-Manchurian economic group and was about to reorganize the South Manchuria Railway, his relationship with the Kwantung Army externally and with Vice President Hatta internally became increasingly unsatisfactory, so President Hayashi made this final decision. As for the appointment of Yosuke Matsuoka, Army Minister Hayashi mentioned it when Commander Minami traveled to Manchuria. Army Minister Hayashi's policy regarding the South Manchuria Railway's personnel was to follow Commander Minami's intentions, so he also strongly supported Matsuoka. (1st Day Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Yosuke Matsuoka returned to Tokyo from Gotemba last night. He told reporters at his home, "I don't know what fate I have with Manchuria. The relationship is very deep. To date, I have violated my own will four times to serve in Manchuria. My former position as Vice President of the South Manchuria Railway is a good example. I don't have anything that I can't leave now. That is, the dissolution of the political party alliance, its foundation has been largely established. Even if I leave here to go to Manchuria, there is no difficulty. The presidency issue will be answered when the government comes to negotiate with me. But it is difficult to guarantee that there will be no unexpected events. Originally, a person's position in life can change in an instant, even I, at the age of fifty, am no exception."

<p>(Tokyo) This regular reshuffle of the army has been closely watched both inside and outside the ministry prior to its announcement. The sacrifice of General Masaki and Lieutenant General Hata is said to be due to Minister of the Army Hayashi having achieved the goal of strengthening military control. Although other aspects have not attracted public attention, the allocation of talented and courageous individuals to key positions to consolidate the orthodox approach can be considered appropriate. A key figure in the new lineup is Colonel Ishiwara's appointment as Chief of the General Staff Headquarters Section. It is said that Ishiwara will now be at the core of the General Staff Headquarters and play an active role. Furthermore, the appointment of Lieutenant Colonel Muto as Chief of the Military Affairs Section of the Army Ministry, the heart of the army, and Lieutenant Colonel Kagezo as head of the Manchuria-Mongolia Section, as well as the inclusion of Lieutenant Colonel Yanagida and others, are considered excellent measures. (1st dispatch from the Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese War Ministry today formally announced the reshuffle order for all army officers. Regarding this reshuffle, a major upheaval had occurred beforehand, with Minister of the Army Hayashi's reshuffle proposal being strongly opposed by Inspector General of Military Education Masaki. The issue of Lieutenant General Hata being placed on the waiting list was the main point of conflict. According to the Tokyo Newspaper, this major reshuffle aims to restore internal control within the ministry that had been lost since the Manchurian Incident, to prevent factionalism within the army, and to adopt the principle of using talent appropriately in order to strengthen the army. Regarding Minister of the Army Hayashi's reshuffle, criticisms from various sectors are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Criticisms from both Houses of Parliament</p>
<p>Since the May 15th Incident, in which young military officers assassinated Prime Minister Inukai, the upper echelons of the military have lacked control, allowing lower-ranking officers to dominate the entire army. At least, this is the impression that the world has. The public has always held the military in respect, trust, and affection, but young military officers have used secret publications and various documents to instill fear in the nation and its people, leading to a great deal of social unrest. This shift from respect, trust, and affection to fear means that this reshuffle can reduce a great deal of social anxiety. This matter has a greater impact on the political landscape and the public than the Saito and Okada cabinets. Minister of the Army Hayashi has fulfilled half of his heavy responsibilities. What deserves attention is the issue of future leadership.</p>
<p>(2) Criticisms from Newspapers</p>
<p>Regarding this reshuffle, major newspapers in Tokyo mostly praise Minister of the Army Hayashi's wise decision. The Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun, known as the mouthpiece of the military, states that the current reshuffle still has some shortcomings. The waiting list status of Generals Hishikari and Matsui is unexpected for Matsui. (The Yomiuri Shimbun also makes a similar statement, saying that Hayashi's actions towards Matsui were like "shedding tears to execute Ma Su.") Because General Matsui established the Greater Asiaism Association outside the army and engaged in various political activities, he was misunderstood by various sectors and was forced to retire due to being perceived as disrupting control. In fact, Matsui supported Minister of the Army Hayashi's control. The reason why Matsui had to retire was that Minister of the Army Hayashi considered the balance of power after Masaki's resignation and sacrificed him. The public is most concerned about Lieutenant General Hata's waiting list status in this reshuffle. There had been many rumors about Hata's actions while serving as Commander of the Kenpeitai. After General Masaki's resignation, Hata naturally could not remain in his position. It was originally planned that Lieutenant Generals Tatekawa and Koiso, and Major General Tojo of the Control Faction would advance to the central government, but they remained in their local positions. It is said that this was not Minister of the Army Hayashi's intention, and it is a regret within the ministry. It can be described as a shortcoming. As for the promotion of Colonel Ishiwara, a meritorious figure in the Manchurian Incident, to Chief of the Operations Section of the General Staff Headquarters, the appointment of Colonel Ishimoto of the Kwantung Army as head of the Investigation Unit, the transfer of Military Attaché Kagezo to head of the Manchuria-Mongolia Section of the Military Affairs Section of the Army Ministry, and the appointment of Lieutenant Colonel Hanaya as a staff officer of the Kwantung Army, all of which represent the heavy use of young military officers, are the highlights of Minister of the Army Hayashi's fourth reshuffle plan. It is said that the regular reshuffle in December will be the finishing touch to Minister of the Army Hayashi's personnel policy.</p>
<p>(3) Criticisms from Social Democrats</p>
<p>The Shikyoku Shimbun, the organ of the Social Democrats, states that this reshuffle is not a retreat of the "Western Faction" but a defeat of the "disguised hardliners." Its main point is that if General Masaki's resignation is seen as a retreat of the fascist faction, it is a mistake. The head of the disguised hardliners is in fact making the entire army even more rigid. The strongest hardliners in the army have advanced to the central government, such as Colonel Ishiwara of the Manchurian Incident being appointed Chief of the Operations Section, Lieutenant Colonel Kagezo as head of the Manchuria-Mongolia Section, and Colonel Ishimoto as head of the Investigation Unit. The future direction of the army will be determined by these middle-ranking officers. This, coupled with the reappointment of Lieutenant Colonel Hanaya as a staff officer of the Kwantung Army, makes the trend even more noteworthy. (1st dispatch from the Chinese League)</p>
<h3 id="e19">Finance Minister Takahashi Advises Japan to Exercise Restraint: Necessary Military Expenses Can Be Approved <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Hayama – Finance Minister Takahashi, who is staying at his villa in Isshiki, Hayama, made a statement on the current situation on the 31st, saying, "The budget must be examined and determined through practical negotiations. Demands that are approved during practical negotiations and then subsequently requested again are useless. The truly necessary items should be approved from the beginning. Reinstatement requests will not be approved in principle, except for those within the scope of the troop budget that are mutually flexible between the expenses of each ministry. National defense expenses, which are absolutely necessary in light of the international situation, must be approved. However, if the army and navy compete for unnecessary expenditures in the name of national defense, then we should be humble towards the people. The war between Bolivia and Paraguay for two years caused the people to suffer terribly, which can serve as a warning. The Abyssinian problem should not lead to war. If Europe is stable, then European power will gradually reach East Asia. Therefore, Japan should exercise restraint and not make too many enemies. Regarding low interest rates, I believe that the trend of the financial world is the right one. I have no preconceived notions about this. The Bank of Japan is well aware of interest rate policies, and its judgment will be fair." (1st dispatch from the Domei News Agency)</p>

<p>(Washington) Navy Secretary Swanson stated today that after the current naval treaty expires, the issue of naval bases and fortifications on the Aleutian Islands and US islands in the Pacific Ocean must be considered. He also said that any international naval conference must discuss this issue. Swanson believes that after the Washington Naval Treaty expires at the end of 1936, the current restrictions on fortification will become invalid. Also, if the United States loses the Philippine Islands, the navy may have to be stationed elsewhere, so this issue must be considered. However, the Navy Secretary also solemnly stated that these actions will only be considered after the Washington Treaty expires. Swanson stated that the Navy Department is fully aware of Britain's shipbuilding plans, but the US shipbuilding plan will aim for the strength allowed by the treaty, at least until 1942. Regardless of the actions of other countries, the United States will not change its plans. As for the issue of replacing battleships, no decision has been made yet, but if Britain and Japan have other shipbuilding plans in 1937, the United States may also follow suit. At the same time, President Roosevelt also stated in a conversation with the press that defense issues must be considered after the naval treaty expires. Undersecretary of State Phillips said that there are no new developments in naval issues and that the State Department has not recently discussed fortification and other issues with other countries.

<h3 id="e29">Soviet International Trade <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>(TASS Moscow dispatch, July 10) Soviet foreign trade became a surplus in 1933, and debt has been reduced to a minimum. Recently, due to increased Soviet exports and long-term credit, imports have also greatly expanded. According to the figures for the past four months of this year, Soviet exports are decreasing, while imports are increasing due to the favorable conditions of foreign orders. The decrease in exports is due to improved domestic living conditions and increased demand. However, in the past four months, Soviet foreign trade still had a surplus of 18.4 million rubles. Recently, the nature of Soviet foreign trade goods has undergone great changes. Almost all imported goods can now be manufactured domestically, so foreign imports only supplement domestic shortages and accelerate the completion of economic plans. They do not play a major role in any economic sector. For four years, machinery imports have greatly decreased, while raw materials and ordinary commodities have increased (commodities increased from 6.8% in 1931 to 15% in 1934).</p>
<p>Among Soviet export goods, industrial products are increasing day by day. Please see the table below:</p>
<h3 id="e30">Soviet Heavy Industry Export Goods <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The export of machinery has increased rapidly in both absolute and relative numbers. In the first four months of last year, machinery exports were 831,000 rubles, and in the same period this year, they increased to 3.16 million rubles. Last year was the first year that the Soviet Union exported pig iron. In the first four months of last year, pig iron exports were 1,400 tons, and in the same period this year, they were 86,400 tons. Last year, Soviet pig iron exports accounted for 7% of the world's pig iron exports.</p>
<p>Some goods were originally imported but have become export goods due to industrial development, such as machinery, steel, cement, coal, rolled steel, electric bubbles, fertilizers, clothing, and various chemicals. From this, it can be seen that the Soviet economy is developing rapidly, and the structure of its foreign trade is also undergoing major changes.</p>

<p>(Geneva) The resolution drafted by Eden and Laval to resolve the Italian-Abyssinian dispute has been opposed by the Italian side. As a result, this afternoon's 5 PM public meeting has been postponed until tomorrow, with the time yet to be determined. At the same time, Laval has asked Mussolini not to raise objections for the time being. It is reported that the Italian government does not want the Council to be involved in Italian activities in any way. It is believed that the draft resolution submitted to the Italian and Abyssinian sides today represents the minimum requirement of the British. It is reported that the British explanation of the French original draft contains an agreement that if negotiations based on the 1906 treaty fail, the entire problem should be studied in September. The resolution lists the following five points:</p>
<p>(1) The League of Nations Council should interpret the scope of work of the Conciliation Committee and confirm Italy's view that the Committee is not responsible for surveying boundary lines. (2) Appoint a fifth arbitrator and ask the Conciliation Committee to follow the precedent of 1928 so that a solution can be agreed upon by September 1.</p>
<p>(3) The three countries that signed the 1906 treaty should immediately begin negotiations to facilitate a solution. This solution, with the cooperation of the Abyssinian government, can ensure good relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>(4) Both sides should conduct negotiations and submit a report on September 4.</p>
<p>(5) The League of Nations Council, regardless of the situation, must meet on September 4 to discuss the entire situation. It is not yet certain whether the obligation not to resort to force will be included in the resolution, but in any case, it will contain this meaning. Some quarters are quite optimistic that a compromise can be reached within 24 hours. The main obstacles to a compromise are Italy's failure to concede and announce that it will not resort to force, and Rome's opposition to the 1906 treaty. (1st dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<h3 id="e33">League of Nations Meeting the Other Day: Italy and Abyssinia Present Their Cases; Representatives of Various Countries Focus on Behind-the-Scenes Negotiations <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Executive Council meeting to discuss the Italo-Abyssinian issue convened at 5:00 PM today amidst a tense atmosphere. The first meeting was held in the former Disarmament Conference venue in utmost secrecy, lasting less than an hour, allowing the representatives to continue negotiations behind the scenes during the break. After the meeting, the Executive Council issued a communiqué stating that the meeting would continue tomorrow afternoon, and the countries concerned would strive to find a way to continue the arbitration and mediation work. Today's meeting began with the Abyssinian representative, Mr. Jeze, speaking first, followed by the Italian representative, Mr. Aloisi, and the British representative, Mr. Eden. All three presented preliminary information on mediation. The Chairman of the Executive Council, Mr. Litvinov, stated that the Executive Council meeting was limited to the League of Nations Covenant. The French representative, Mr. Laval, proposed adjournment. Sources with inside information claim that efforts are currently underway to find a formal solution to the Italo-Abyssinian dispute within the framework of the League of Nations, and to invoke the 1906 Tripartite Treaty to seek a basis for practical mediation. Prior to today's meeting, representatives of the countries concerned held preliminary talks. The French delegation expressed optimism, claiming that a compromise solution on procedural issues was imminent, but this optimism may be somewhat artificial. It is widely rumored here that Mr. Eden has stated that he would only agree to continue mediation if Italy guarantees not to resort to force before the League of Nations Executive Council convenes in August. (31st National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Although Abyssinia is not a member of the Executive Council today, its League of Nations representative, Mr. Hawaaryat, was invited to attend, assisted by Dr. Jeze, the legal advisor to the Abyssinian delegation. First, Chairman Litvinov read the agenda and a telegram from Italian Prime Minister Mussolini regarding reservations on the scope of discussion. The Abyssinian representative then stood up to state Abyssinia's reasons and insisted that the issue of sovereignty over the seven territories should be included, and that Abyssinia reserved the right to raise all issues. Mr. Laval then proposed an adjournment to facilitate informal negotiations. Mr. Eden expressed his agreement, but stated that the Executive Council's right to expand the scope of discussion should not be restricted in any way. The attitude taken by the Abyssinian representative today was quite weak, and he did not protest the crucial point of limiting the agenda to discussing the Walwal incident, which surprised everyone. When Mr. Laval proposed adjournment, Italian representative Aloisi jumped up and said that his attendance at the meeting was only for discussing the mediation issue. After the adjournment, Mr. Litvinov, Mr. Laval, Mr. Eden, and Mr. Aloisi immediately held an informal meeting. If a consensus could be reached through private talks, the United Kingdom would accept it. However, if a consensus could not be reached, Mr. Eden would strongly request the Executive Council meeting to conduct a comprehensive discussion of the dispute. (31st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Messrs. Avenol, Litvinov, Laval, and Eden convened in Mr. Avenol's private office after the adjournment of the League of Nations Executive Council, seeking a satisfactory way to achieve some kind of resolution that the Executive Council must pass. It is said that Mr. Laval insisted that negotiations should be as swift as possible, as he must return to Paris on Friday or Saturday. Mr. Eden seemed less optimistic about the outcome of today's meeting. According to those close to the British delegation, the British delegation was quite dissatisfied with the lack of enthusiasm among the representatives of various countries for supporting the League of Nations. Mr. Aloisi's long conversation with Abyssinian representative Professor Jeze after the adjournment attracted general attention. (31st National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beijing) An article in an Italian newspaper reveals Mussolini's hand and is detrimental to the peace efforts in Geneva. A key sentence reads, "Italy will move forward with Geneva, or without Geneva, or even in opposition to Geneva." "The solution to the Abyssinian problem must be a comprehensive solution. Opening up and assisting with force, or guaranteeing territory without accompanying military plans, will inevitably lead to a second Adowa." The article explains the security of Italian colonies, stating that only Italy can be the judge, and says, "When danger comes, we will not be assisted by anyone, and we may even be kicked when we are down. Italy does not fight under the pretext of abolishing slavery, but the abolition of slavery will naturally be the logical consequence of its policies." (1st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa The King of Abyssinia has ordered the Abyssinian representatives in Geneva to strictly adhere to the instructions they have received and not to make any concessions. The King told news reporters that this instruction actually opens the way for a peaceful resolution. The Abyssinian bishops also sent a telegram to Geneva appealing for peace, saying that the attention of the world is focused on Geneva in the hope of avoiding bloodshed. (1st National Telegram)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa The British "Times" published a message stating that the United Kingdom, France, and other countries advocate placing Abyssinia under the trusteeship of the League of Nations and have made suggestions to the Abyssinian Emperor. Mr. Heruy, the Abyssinian Foreign Minister, has formally denied that the Abyssinian Emperor has had any contact in this regard. Those in charge further stated that this suggestion is unacceptable to Abyssinia. (31st Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa Abyssinia is prepared to fight to the end. The whole country is filled with the spirit of war, and people of all levels are rushing to practice military skills. The formal troops are prepared to fight back vigorously when the Italian army attacks. Officials are paying close attention to the attitude of the United Kingdom in Geneva. The government is most concerned about the inability to import arms. Therefore, it is widely rumored that Abyssinia will sign a commercial treaty with Sweden on August 7, thereby canceling the Swedish arms embargo. A spokesperson for the Abyssinian government stated that Abyssinia is willing to make economic concessions to achieve mutual benefit, but if political concessions are desired, they must first come through war. (31st National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare recently stated in the House of Commons that there are a total of 163 British missionaries, expatriates, and their families residing within the borders of Abyssinia. The government is discussing with the British Minister to Abyssinia and the French government to seek proper solutions to protect the safety of these expatriates. Overseas Trade Minister Mr. Colville stated that the government has not prohibited the export of raw materials used for manufacturing munitions to Abyssinia. (31st Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>The Hague Prime Minister Dr. Colijn stated to the press today that the Dutch government is determined to maintain the gold standard. He also said that an international conference on commerce and monetary stability should be convened as soon as possible. (31st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>The Hague After the news of the formation of Mr. Colijn's new cabinet spread, business circles were greatly relieved. Business circles had been feeling uneasy about the large outflow of gold and hoped that the establishment of a responsible government would eliminate this crisis. Mr. Colijn's choice of new cabinet members, all of whom were veterans, has drawn various criticisms from opposition newspapers. Socialist newspapers claim that the cabinet has not changed and that the previous dangerous policies will continue. The Catholic Party is taking an extremely reserved attitude, saying that the new government should be judged by its actions. Political circles predict that Mr. Colijn does not want to submit the list of new cabinet members to the parliament immediately but will suspend the parliament and submit a report when the parliament reconvenes, explaining the government's measures. At the same time, he will issue emergency orders to reorganize national affairs. The Dutch currency has gradually become stable. (31st National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) Mr. Colijn, the newly appointed Prime Minister of the Netherlands, recently stated to the correspondent of the Paris Economic and Financial News Agency stationed in the Dutch capital, "The Dutch political unrest was quickly resolved in a matter of days, so that the guilder was not forced to devalue. Under unstable political conditions, the devaluation of the guilder would be enough to shake the economic life of the country. The activities of speculators attacking the guilder have completely failed. The government is determined to continue its past policies on monetary issues. As for restoring normal international trade relations and stabilizing international currency prices, both are urgent tasks at hand and must be completed in a short period of time. All countries should jointly negotiate to seek solutions to these two issues. If there are any serious efforts on the part of the international community regarding these issues, such as convening an international conference on currency stability, the Dutch government will naturally cooperate and will not delay."

<p>(Vienna) Prince Starhemberg, leader of the Home Guard and Deputy Prime Minister, recently issued an order to the cadres of the Home Guard in Tyrol, strictly prohibiting the Home Guard from engaging in all political activities. He stated, "All soldiers should abide by the precept of non-interference in politics. For example, regarding the issue of the restoration of the Habsburg dynasty, the Patriotic League must not be divided by this issue. In the future, all informal armed groups that cannot abandon political activities will be dissolved by the government. The government is now strong and does not fear such armed groups." Starhemberg continued, "Austria's diplomatic position is not yet consolidated. Soon, Austria's independence will be guaranteed by all countries and will not be disputed.

<p>(Washington) It is now apparent here that Germany's protest regarding the New York incident has placed President Roosevelt's government in a dilemma. If it apologizes to Germany, there are four difficulties: (1) The voting power of American Jews and Catholics is very large; (2) There is a strong and active minority in Congress that wants to sever diplomatic relations with Germany and will seize the opportunity to make demands if an apology is made; (3) The government itself is somewhat displeased with the Hitler government, partly because of Hitler's religious and racial policies, and partly because Germany has violated treaties and discriminated against American products and American holders of German bonds; (4) The Bremen postal ship brought this on itself because the police were in a difficult position. The government first and foremost wants to abide by all treaties and protect the flags of other countries. Secondly, it dislikes the Communist Party and does not want to condone its actions. At the same time, the New York Police Department has prepared a detailed report for the State Department's reference. The State Department's reply to Germany will probably be sent on Sunday.

According to a staff member of the German Embassy, ​​Mr. Mueller and British journalist Jones left Duolun on the 27th and encountered bandits in Guanaamagou, 50 miles northeast of Baochang, at 11:00 AM on the 28th. There were more than 1,000 bandits who rushed out of the sorghum fields on both sides with complete weapons. If the Deutsch-Hua Automobile Company's vehicle they were traveling in had not been hit in the water tank, it might have escaped danger. After Mr. Mueller, Mr. Jones, etc. were kidnapped, the bandits released the driver and Mr. Liang, Mr. Mueller's servant, ordering them to report to the Baochang County Government and prepare 100,000 silver dollars, pistols, 20 machine guns, and 40 rifles, each with 20,000 rounds of ammunition, to redeem them. After Mr. Liang, etc. reported to Baochang, they went to Zhangjiakou to report to the British and German embassies separately. After Mr. Mueller was kidnapped, he was released due to language issues. British journalist Jones is still in the bandit den. It is not yet known whether Jones will be able to escape safely in the next few days. Mr. Mueller is grateful for the concern and efforts to rescue him from the Chinese government and Chinese and foreign friends after experiencing this extraordinary incident. According to semi-official sources, the Chahar Provincial Government ordered Squad Leader Zhang of the Baochang Security Team to negotiate with the bandits to rescue Jones. The process is going well, and a satisfactory result may be obtained in the next day or two. Mr. Shah and Mr. Wei, the two military attaches sent by the British Embassy, ​​are still in Zhangjiakou, assisting in everything. Mr. Xiao Zhenying will not return to Beiping for the time being due to the incident. (1st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>The German journalist Mueller Arrived in Beiping Yesterday</p>
<p>(Beiping) Mr. Mueller stated that this dangerous situation was caused by a prior agreement with the bandits that he would be temporarily released, leaving Jones in the bandit den as a hostage. After he went out, he could work with all parties concerned to redeem Jones. He also agreed with the bandits that he would fulfill their demands within the specified time to rescue Jones from danger. Otherwise, he would have to return to the bandit den and stay with Jones to the end. Therefore, if Jones can return safely within the specified time, there will be no problem. Otherwise, in order to fulfill his previous words and uphold his personal integrity and friendship, he will still leave Beiping, follow the original route to Baochang, and return to the bandit den. (1st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Dr. Mueller, the German journalist who was kidnapped and then released, stated today that he deeply believes that Mr. Jones, a journalist from the Manchester Guardian, can also be released within 44-48 hours. Dr. Mueller arrived here in Zhangjiakou this morning to assist in the rescue of Jones. It is said that Jones's life is not in danger. Mueller also recounted the kidnapping to a Reuters reporter, saying that on Saturday, while traveling from Zhangjiakou to Duolun, soldiers resembling security guards suddenly opened fire on their car. Fortunately, everyone in the car was unharmed. The car was hit by two bullets. After he and Jones were kidnapped, they were placed in separate rooms. The bandits offered him tea, but threatened to hang Jones by tying one end of a rope to a beam and wrapping it around Jones's neck. This was just a threat and was not carried out. Soon after, they were placed in the same room. All their belongings were taken away. The bandit leader demanded a ransom of 100,000 silver dollars, 40 rifles, 20 pistols, and 60,000 rounds of ammunition. Mr. Jun, the Russian driver, and Mr. Hua, his servant, who were kidnapped with Mueller, were released immediately and sent north. The bandits treated them well, providing them with food and cigarettes. The next day at dusk, they took a circuitous route into the mountains. They saw two Chinese, one in a police uniform and one claiming to be a security team officer, riding horses. They spoke to the bandits. The person claiming to be an officer shouted to them, "We are here to rescue you!" Mueller also said, "I don't know if this statement is true, but the next day I was sent away, accompanied by the person claiming to be a security team officer and three bandits in police uniforms. The bandits instructed me to pay the ransom at the British and German embassies in Beiping. If it is not paid within ten days, Jones will be killed." At the same time, the bandits reduced the ransom to 50,000 silver dollars. Before leaving, Jones asked him to find a way to rescue him. Although Jones is young and is his first time in China, he was not alarmed or disoriented. When he arrived not far from Baochang, the bandits accompanying him asked him to ride his horse on his own. When he arrived in Baochang, the person claiming to be the security team officer was actually waiting on the road. Later, he learned that the person's name was Zhang Zhongzhi (transliteration), who seemed to have a lot of influence with the bandit leader. After Mueller arrived in Zhangjiakou, he reported the situation to Xiao Zhenying, who immediately telephoned Zhang Zhongzhi, asking him to contact the bandits and persuade them to release Jones. Xiao promised to compensate Mueller and Jones for their losses. After Mueller arrived in Beiping, he reported everything to the British and German embassies. He will go to Zhangjiakou tomorrow and, if necessary, to Baochang to assist in the rescue. Mueller firmly believes that although the bandits threatened to kill Jones if the ransom is not paid, they will definitely not harm him. Jones will be out of danger soon, or may be released within 48 hours. (1st Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Chengdu Communication: The Sichuan Provincial Government's move to Chengdu has been largely arranged. The central task at present is political reform. If we want to achieve political reform, personnel management and financial management are the two most urgent tasks. In terms of personnel, the provincial government has decided to expand the powers of the Civil Service Qualification Review Committee. The appointment of administrative personnel at all levels must first be reviewed and decided by the committee to prevent the appointment of unqualified people. Financial management is the responsibility of the Financial Reorganization Committee. The first step is to determine provincial and county expenditures and prepare budgets to eliminate waste. The provincial budget has been prepared by the Department of Finance and submitted to the Military Headquarters for review. The standards for county budget preparation and transitional measures were drafted at a joint meeting of the Provincial Government Financial Reorganization Committee on July 26. The provincial government has made precise revisions, focusing on considering the people's resources and striving for austerity. Yesterday, it issued a circular to all commissioners, instructing the county magistrates under their jurisdiction to strictly comply. The original order, budget preparation standards, and transitional measures are listed below.</p>
<p>Provincial Government Circular: "According to the ancient practice, all grains were included to determine national expenditure. This is the legacy of the budget and the constant principle of establishing a country. The county government's duty is to shepherd the people, so it should understand the people's resources and make arrangements accordingly. In the past, the counties had no governance, and expenditure was chaotic and could not be assessed. All industries were withered. This is the crux of the problem. At this time, when everything is being renewed, financial management is especially urgent. Living within our means is an iron rule that must be followed at present. However, since this is the beginning, there are no precedents to follow. It is difficult to cut off the water to quench the thirst in transitional finance. This government has solemnly discussed with the Financial Reorganization Committee and has separately discussed and decided on the budget standards for the counties this year and the hesitant period measures. These measures are issued so that county finance can be put on the right track on the one hand, and adapt to the facts on the other hand to avoid obstacles in implementation. It must be known that the people are poor and their resources are exhausted, which has reached its extreme. Saving one cent of public funds for the government is reducing one cent of suffering for the people. The salaries and income of the county magistrates are all the lifeblood of the people. You should search your conscience and not be willing to indulge in waste. The county government expenditure budget proposed by the Civil Affairs Department, although it has been submitted for review, has not yet been finalized. You should still consider the people's resources and tighten up the budget. You do not have to allocate and spend all of the estimates. Even during the hesitant period, you should avoid redundancy. You must ask the commissioner and county magistrate to consider the difficulties of the times, love the people, and be frugal. Within three days of receiving this order, you should prepare a budget and submit it to the District Commissioner's Office for review and transfer to this government for compilation before September 15. This matter concerns financial legislation and is the foundation for promoting all administration. You must strictly comply and do not treat it as a mere formality. If you delay, you will be severely reprimanded. This order."</p>
<p>Standard Measures: Instructions on Budget Preparation Standards and Transitional Measures for Each County. (1) The hesitant period for each county to prepare a budget and for the Special Office and Provincial Government to review the budget is limited to three months, from August 1 to October 31. (2) During the hesitant period, for local administrative affairs that have special funds, such as county administrative subsidies, judicial expenses, educational expenses, and construction expenses, the county magistrate should supervise the finance committee to temporarily audit and disburse expenses in accordance with the county government expenditure budget proposed by the Department of Civil Affairs (which has been reported for review but has not yet been finalized), ensuring that there is a surplus. The remaining funds will be used for emerging businesses. (3) During the hesitant period, for local administrative affairs that do not have special funds, such as public security expenses, finance committee expenses, the joint security office expenses, and Baojia expenses, the county magistrate should supervise the finance committee to investigate the regulations stipulated by the Military Headquarters and the provincial government, and consider the local financial situation to the extent that they can afford it. The required funds should be allocated from the remaining funds in the previous paragraph. (4) This year's budget should be prepared in accordance with the above two methods. The outline of the preparation should follow the regulations of the Military Headquarters for reorganizing local finances in bandit suppression areas, and refer to local conditions. (5) During the hesitant period, all previous surcharges should be temporarily allowed to continue to be levied for expenditure. (6) All funds collected in the lower quarter of this year during the hesitant period should be levied at half the rate. In addition to the expenditure for July, August, September and October, the remaining funds should be included in the budget income as legitimate expenditure. (7) Improper income and expenditure and wasteful expenditure should be abolished. (8) All funds collected this year should be kept by the Finance Committee. Except for legitimate expenditure from July onwards, they must not be misappropriated for other purposes or to repay old debts. (9) The old debts of Gu County should be thoroughly investigated and dealt with in a separate case. (10) Educational expenses should be based on legitimate income. If they come from taxes and there are no other funds to be allocated, they should continue to be levied as before. However, all exorbitant taxes must not be used in the name of educational expenses in the hope of preserving them. (11) The expenses of the Joint Security Office and the Baojia expenses may be budgeted at the lowest amount, limited to pens, ink, paper, and necessary office expenses. (12) If the finance committees of each county have not been established, they must be established within five days of receiving this document. (13) All illegal income from villages and districts below the county level should be stopped. (14) After the budget proposals of each county are prepared, they should be submitted to the Special Commissioner's Office for review and transfer to the Provincial Government before September 15. (15) The total amount of budgeted expenditure for this year must not exceed the previous year.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Serious Flooding in Northern Jiangsu; Yellow Water Reaches North of Pei; Copper Border Still Building Embankments <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Xuzhou Communication: The breach of the Yellow River in Western Shandong and the influx of yellow water has caused Weishan Lake to rise three times. It is now gradually showing a tendency to become serious. Because the people of Western Shandong believed that the overflow of the Shandong water had nowhere to go and that the reeds in Nanyang Lake were blocking the flow, they cut them all down, resulting in a smooth flow of water and an unobstructed discharge. In addition, because large embankments were built in Northern Jiangsu, in addition to the Shandong Provincial Government's telegram to the Central Government, the people of Western Shandong entrusted Sun Zerang, a branch director of the Shandong Rural Construction Research Institute, to come to Xuzhou with two representatives of the people to inspect Pei. At this time of urgent flooding, the people of Northern Jiangsu are only preventing them from randomly observing and guiding. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Water Level of Weishan Lake Rises Sharply: After the yellow water initially flowed into Nanyang Lake in Southern Shandong, Weishan Lake rose in conjunction. Because the reeds in the two lakes blocked the flow, and the south bank of Nanyang Lake was slightly higher than the north bank, very little water flowed into Weishan Lake. Recently, because the people of Western Shandong were overflowing with Shandong water, they cut down all the reeds in Nanyang Lake, so the downstream was unobstructed. Also, because of the full water in various places in Western Shandong, only Weishan Lake can be injected, so the water level suddenly rose sharply. On the morning of the 29th, it rose sharply by one meter, and then continued to rise. According to yesterday's news, the water head has reached the Sanshui Building in the north of Pei, and is continuing to irrigate from the north bank to the south bank. It is found that the diameter from Nanyang Lake to the south bank of Weishan Lake is 300 li, and the reeds in Weishan Lake are still there, so the south bank is not very tight for the time being, but the north bank has been hit by the disaster. Xia Zhen, on the northeast bank of the lake, belongs to the sixth district of Pei County and is the channel of the waterway. The small embankment that the residents are rushing to block along the lake has been washed away, and the water has risen to the shore, turning the tidal flats into a swamp. Residents on the lake shore are fleeing one after another. Yang Guantun, on the northwest bank of the lake, also belongs to the sixth district of Pei County. The new embankment passes through the area. The water has risen far above the tidal flats, and the water level is half a li away from the embankment at the closest point. Pei City is safe for the time being, but the areas along the lake are in a state of emergency. The Pei County Government sent a clerk Wang to Xuzhou on the 29th to purchase sacks. Peng, the section chief of the Tongshan County Government, handled everything on his behalf. Yesterday, they were transported to Pei by long-distance bus for use in rushing to block the dike. Commissioner Shao is in Pei, supervising the construction of the embankment day and night, which is expected to be completed in about three or four days. It is found that the fifth and sixth breaches at the breach of Linpuji have been washed into one by the water. Although there is no large torrent at present, and the autumn floods have not passed, it is still in danger. If the breaches are not connected, the harm to Northern Jiangsu is far from over.</p>
<p>Representatives from Western Shandong Go to Pei: The people of Western Shandong suspect that the large amount of water flowing into Western Shandong is blocked by the large embankment built in Northern Jiangsu. In fact, the embankment is only built on the west bank of Weishan Lake, a straight embankment running from northwest to southeast, not a horizontal embankment running from east to west. It is still far from the tidal flats of Weishan Lake. Although Weishan Lake has risen several times, the water level has never reached the embankment. This is because the embankment is named the Northern Jiangsu Dike, which caused a misunderstanding. The people of the thirteen counties belonging to Heze recommended Sun Zerang, director of the First Branch of the Shandong Rural Suggestion Research Institute, to come to Xuzhou to conduct an on-site investigation. Sun, who formerly served as the magistrate of Heze County, is very familiar with the situation in Western Shandong. He and two representatives of the people transferred to Kaifeng and came to Xuzhou. After arriving in Xuzhou yesterday morning, he contacted Zhou Xiaoxi, the secretary of the Special Office, and Jian Hua, the secretary of the County Government. He took a bus to Pei to meet Commissioner Shao and asked him to send someone to guide him to inspect the embankment. After inspecting the embankment, Sun and others learned that the function of the embankment was to prevent the lake from overflowing at will, and that it was by no means blocking the water and causing it to flow backward. After the yellow water enters Weishan Lake, if it reaches a certain water level, it can be discharged through the Hulou Shuangzha and Linjiaba in two ways, one directly into the canal and the other around Jingshan in the copper border into the canal. At present, Linjiaba is repairing the embankment and sluice gate, and the Hulou Shuangzha is also planned to be renovated. The Jiangsu Provincial Government will also guide the treatment of the canal to smooth its flow and avoid damage along the way. Sun and others seem to have fully understood this. After the inspection is completed, they will return to Western Shandong to announce and explain to the people to avoid misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Copper Border Dike Project Completed: The Weishan Lake Dike along the copper border has been constructed at an extremely rapid pace since County Magistrate Wang Gongyu led the people to build it at the Wuduan Tuocheng site. Today (31st), it has been fully completed. Wang believed that the people were enthusiastically building the dike, and the township chiefs were supervising the construction. After the embankment was completed, Wang also believed that the embankment and sluice gate of Linjiaba were being repaired, and this gate was the mouth of the south bank of Wei, which was of great importance. If the Wei water level is high, there will be no obstacles to going down the sluice. But if the water force is impacting, it will break the imperial dyke. Therefore, it is planned to build a horizontal dyke in Jing Mountain outside Lanjia Ba to prevent the water force from breaking through horizontally. After the Comfort Conference was opened, the project of repairing the sluice gate at Lanjiaba began immediately. Chief of the Third Section Liu Xinyuan is currently going to supervise the repair, and it is decided to use construction funds to set up an iron plate gate to strengthen it and facilitate the opening and closing of the gate. However, the Hulou Shuangzha project is grand, and the provincial government will send someone to survey it and plan it separately.</p>
<p>All Circles Jointly Telegraph the Provincial Government: Various circles in Xubu telegraphed to the Provincial Government, saying, "Extremely urgent! Chen, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and Shen Junjian, Director of the Construction Department, the Yellow River in Shandong burst its banks and flooded south, turning the counties in Southern Shandong into a country of water. Our Ninth District Commissioner Shao and the magistrates of Tong and Pei counties, fearing the arrival of the Yellow River disaster, are conscripting hundreds of thousands of civilians to rush to block the Northern Jiangsu Dike day and night to prevent and control it. And the Yellow River water is coming with great force, and is now rushing straight into Weishan Lake from Nanyang. The lake water has increased by two meters in one day and night. The lake has been silted up for a long time and it is difficult to contain it. If the water level increases by one day, and the big torrent scours the new dike, it is worrying whether it can defend it. It is found that Weishan Lake is a giant reservoir in Jiangbei. If the defense project is not strong, there is a possibility of seizing it and entering the Huai River. Not only will the guiding of the Huai River project fail, but the flooding and submergence of the counties in Northern Jiangsu will be ten times greater than in Southern Shandong. Therefore, we dare to telegraph the Chairman and Director of the Department to personally inspect the dike defense, and instruct how to save the overall situation in Northern Jiangsu. The telegram from Lin is extremely urgent and waiting for orders. Talk Minghua, Standing Committee of the Tongshan County Party Department, Su Qiliu, Construction Committee, and representatives of various groups Li Fengru, Wu Xiaogan, Lan Bohua, Liu Zhiyuan, etc." (July 31)</p>
<h3 id="e82">Devastating Floods in Chaoshan: Han River's White Waves Seal Off Chaozhou City, Turning Coastal Villages into Swamps <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The Chaoshan region has been experiencing scorching heat for days. On the 24th evening, the weather suddenly changed, bringing torrential rainfall that continued until the 27th. As a result, the Han River's water level rose dramatically, turning the coast into a marsh. The excessive rainfall in the bordering counties of Fujian and Jiangxi has led to a surge of water flowing downstream to the Chaoshan region, making the Han River the final recipient.</p>
<p>Around Shantou Station on the Chaoshan Railway, over ten *li* from Qishan to Yueqing is submerged. As far as the eye can see, the fields have become lakes and swamps. Fortunately, the early rice harvest was completed, and the autumn rice was just about to be planted, minimizing the losses to the farmers. In the Shuangxi Bridge to Anbu station area, the water level is only four to five feet below the bridge. If it rises further, the trains will have to stop running. In the lower reaches of the Han River, the water flow is rapid. Due to the slippery mud on the embankment, bus services along the levee road were suspended on the 25th. Electric boats traveling from Shantou to Chenghai Donglong were suspended on the 26th due to the dangerous rapid currents. The Chenghai Epu dike, which had previously collapsed due to water erosion, has been repeatedly repaired but remains unstable. Residents from Qishan and Chijiao in the Shantou suburbs are guarding the dike day and night. On the 25th, the dike in Fulong Dongdun village suddenly collapsed, sending water towards Chenghai. The Shantou-Zhangzhou light railway was submerged, slightly easing the water situation in Anbu. Downstream from Anbu station, the fields are mostly filled with yellow, muddy water. Rainwater has accumulated in the fields along the road from Anbu to Chaoan City due to the rising Han River, preventing proper drainage and causing inundation. Citrus fruits, sugarcane, and other agricultural products along the railway have suffered extensive damage from wind and rain, resulting in incalculable losses. Villages along the Han River under the jurisdiction of the Qidu Public Office have also been affected. Strong men are taking turns guarding the dike. Fir wood and sandbags are stockpiled on the dike for emergency rescue. In Chaoan City, the streets and alleys along the West Lake Road and inside the city are filled with accumulated water, creating a desolate scene. Many shops remain closed, and pedestrians wade through the water. Areas like Juying Lane and in front of the county government office are knee-deep in water. At this time, the people inside and outside the city are effectively sealed off by the flood. The east, south, and north city gates, built along the river with sturdy walls, stand over thirty feet tall from the base to the battlements, serving as flood defenses. The terrain outside the city is about six to seven feet to ten feet lower than inside, causing the most hardship for residents outside the walls, who are already submerged in the flood. Whenever the water rises, wooden planks are dropped into the Bamboo Gate, Upper Water Gate, and Lower Water Gate of Chaozhou City to prevent water from entering. Each plank is eight inches high and fourteen feet long, matching the size of the city gate. After the first layer of planks is in place, the second layer of planks inside the city is also prepared in case the water breaches the first layer, providing a second line of defense. Sandbags are placed behind the planks. On the 26th, fifteen planks were lowered, with the water reaching the eighth plank, about six feet above ground level. Without the city walls, Chaoan City would be completely flooded. The embankment stretches over fifty thousand feet and stands five *zhang* above the land, but the riverbed has been silted up with mud and sand over the years, making the river bottom higher than the land inside the embankment. If the embankment were to collapse, the Han River could change its course and flow into the sea from Jieyang. Chaoan, Chenghai, and Jieyang counties would be the first to suffer damage. Therefore, during days of high water levels, the eighteen floating bridge boats in the middle of the surging waves were unmoored. Each of the twenty-four large bridge piles, which originally had two to four shops on them, now only has the corners of the roofs above the water. The sound of the water washing them away is deafening, and the entire bridge is submerged. Only whirlpools mark the location of the bridge piles. Further away, only tree branches above the water are visible. It is reported that many places along the river have become swamps, but thankfully, there have been no reports of dike collapses. The current in the river is swift, and the distance between the two banks is about ten *li*. A few ferries provide transportation, but fares are very expensive. People walk slowly. Zhumenzhijie Street, which leads to the river, is like a stream or river. The tall waterfront wharves cannot operate due to the high water. Boats are moored on the uneven city wall, creating a natural dock. Outside the Zhumen Gate, the shops and houses are mostly inhabited by poor people and are very small. Poor men, women, and children huddle on the tiled roofs, eating, resting, and sleeping on the uneven tiles, using umbrellas to shield themselves from the wind and rain, looking pathetic. Some women and children squat and wail, creating a truly miserable scene.</p>
<p>The Tragic Robbery Cases in Songjiang and Punan</p>
<p>Lu Yunlian, head of the Seventh Bao of the Nineteenth Tu of the Seventh District of Punan, was robbed. She is the head of the seventh bao. She returned home the night before last after working in Songjiang. That night, more than ten robbers suddenly broke into her home and robbed her. The robbers found gun bullets and demanded the location of the firearm, even using fire to burn her. Eventually, they stole a self-defense pistol with the county seal No. 274 and more than thirty rifle bullets. They also took fox and sheepskin robes, gold and pearl jewelry, resulting in significant losses. Also, the home of Jiang Siquan, the third household of the second Jia of the second Bao of Xihutang Township in the Eighth District, was attacked by more than ten robbers at one o'clock in the morning on the 30th. They broke down the door and entered. The victim and his nephew, A Mao, stepped forward to resist but were beaten with wooden sticks. Jiang Siquan and A Mao were severely beaten. The robbers stole three *dan* of white rice, four pieces of clothing, five yuan in banknotes, six bolts of cloth, and nine sacks before fleeing. The County Public Security Bureau received a long-distance telephone report from the Ninth Sub-Bureau Director that Jiang Siquan suffered chest injuries from the robbery and had died from his injuries before he could be treated. His nephew, A Mao, also sustained serious leg injuries.</p>
<p>Suzhou: New President of the District Court Takes Office Yesterday</p>
<p>Ying Shi, the President of the Wuxian District Court, was ordered to exchange positions with Lu Yimei, the President of the Jinan District Court. Mr. Lu arrived in Suzhou from Jinan the day before yesterday. After meeting with President Ying, he officially took office at the Wu District Court at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 1st). The former President Ying left Suzhou for Shanghai on the afternoon of the 31st and is scheduled to take office in Jinan on the 10th of this month.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Labor unrest at Zhenxin Yarn Factory flares up again</p>
<p>The Zhenxin Yarn Factory in Taibaodun, outside the West Gate, experienced a strike on May 17th. Some people were injured and property was damaged. Workers wages were withheld. Up to the present, four wage periods are owed to workers. On the morning of the 31st, the families of the workers, twenty three in total, requested payment from the factory due to difficult living conditions. The factory agreed to pay forty dollars to each family and two dollars per mother, as a temporary solution. However, the factory's wage payments, were scheduled to be paid from the 9th to the 25th of each month, totaling over ten thousand yuan. The factory has not yet paid the wages for July. The workers repeatedly demanded payment from the factory, but the factory insisted on postponing payment until August 15th. The workers refused and began a work stoppage at 4:00 PM. That night, representatives of the factory's branch labor union, Wu Zhenxiang, Liu Borong, You Quangen, and others, led more than four hundred day-shift workers to the County Party Headquarters to petition. Xiao Ruoqian met with them and advised the workers to return first and wait for the County Government to convene representatives from both labor and management for mediation. The workers were satisfied with this. However, the manager, Jiang Shiqing, avoided meeting with them, forcing them to wait outside the door, sleepless and unfed, in a pathetic state. The remaining thousand night-shift workers gathered in the factory square, maintaining order. The heads of the First and Fourth Public Security Bureaus sent police to suppress the unrest. The situation calmed down yesterday morning, and the dispute was resolved. However, the factory is facing tight credit due to the high price of cotton and low price of yarn, and may temporarily suspend operations.</p>
<p>Changshu: Three Male and Female Corpses Discovered in Hengjing Pond</p>
<p>On the morning of the 31st, three male and female bodies were discovered in the Hengjing Pond along the Shanghai-Nanjing Highway outside Xiaodongmen in our county. One man was found embracing a woman, not separating even in death, creating a peculiar sight. The news spread quickly, drawing crowds of onlookers. The village police reported the incident to the Public Security Branch, which in turn reported it to the County Government. Investigator He Cheng was dispatched to the village to examine the bodies. Since there were no family members present, the police station launched an investigation to identify the deceased and determine the cause of death. The village police then collected the bodies for burial.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang: Opening of Jiangsu Province Children's Year</p>

The Provincial Party Headquarters also presented books and goods. The Provincial People's Education Center will also screen the film "Joy of Family" at the Provincial Stadium at 8:00 PM tonight. Shops selling children's products are offering special prices today to show their support.</p>
<p>Ningbo: Five Native Banks Collapse on the Same Day</p>
<p>The native banks in this city have always been known for their reliability. At the end of last month, as financial turmoil tightened in Shanghai, the Ningbo native banks were not affected because of their strong financial standing. Unexpectedly, at the end of this month, five banks including Da Tong Hengyuan, Xinyuan, Yongyuan, Taiyuan, and Wuyuan all declared liquidation on the same day, representing an unprecedented blow to the local banking industry. Hengyuan Bank, which had been in operation for over twenty years, had a capital of 33,000 yuan, with total annual receipts and payments reaching 1,000 yuan. The amount for receipts and payments was approximately 700,000, with deposits of 400,000 yuan and loans of approximately 1 million yuan. It owed 130,000 yuan to public banks. Yongyuan Bank had a capital of 27,500 yuan, an attached capital of 17,500 yuan, and annual receipts and payments of approximately 1 million yuan. After offsetting debts, there was still a surplus of over 100,000 yuan. Taiyuan Bank had a capital of 50,000 yuan, with total annual receipts and payments of approximately 1 million yuan. Wuyuan Bank had a capital of 50,000 yuan, an attached capital of 50,000 yuan, and total annual receipts and payments of approximately 500,000 yuan, deposits of 130,000 yuan. After offsetting various transactions, there was still a surplus of over 10,000 yuan. Huida, an exchange house, also declared liquidation through a lawyer due to financial difficulties. The Bankers Association urgently convened a meeting yesterday to discuss the situation.</p>

<h3 id="e83">American Railroad Magnate Mr. Bernadet Arrives in Shanghai for a Tour. He States That This Is His First Visit. He Will Leave Shanghai Tomorrow Morning to Return Home. <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>American railroad authority Mr. Bernadet arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday with his wife for a leisurely tour. Mr. Bernadet is an American railroad magnate whose railroad operations exceed the total length of railroads in our entire country. A Central News Agency reporter visited him yesterday and learned the following details:</p>
<p>First Visit to the Far East</p>
<p>Mr. Bernadet first stated that he and his wife are taking advantage of the summer vacation to tour the Far East. They departed from San Francisco by ship on the 2nd of last month, first arriving in Yokohama, Japan, then touring major Japanese cities. They then went to Korea, passing through the three northeastern provinces before arriving in Shanghai by train from Beiping. This is his first visit to the Far East, but it is a whirlwind tour with insufficient time to stay. The countries of East Asia are all making great progress, and their railroad industries are also developing. He met with railroad leaders from both China and Japan, but he has no other missions here besides touring and observing.</p>
<p>Glimpses of Operations</p>
<p>The railroads he operates total 13,500 miles, connecting California, Mexico, Chicago, San Francisco, Illinois, Ohio, Minnesota, Virginia, Florida, and other places. The headquarters are in Chicago. There are currently 316 passenger cars, 200 of which are sleeping cars. He began operating railroads in Indian Territory in 1895. He is old now, but is determined to continue working until he is satisfied before retiring.</p>
<p>Opinions on Developing Transportation</p>
<p>Mr. Bernadet believes that transportation development should be promoted by land, sea, and air in coordination. He also stated that trains are convenient for transportation and mentioned that American airline companies also operate railroads, showing that transportation development should be complementary. China's railroad industry has been progressing since the end of the European War, but much more effort is still needed.</p>
<p>Leaving Shanghai Tomorrow Morning to Return Home</p>
<p>Mr. Bernadet concluded that his company's economic situation has been unremarkable in recent years. A large portion of the railway is used to pay for taxes and operating expenses. While there is some profit, it is only enough to cover expenses. A small portion is profitable, but those funds are used for equipment and development. He has decided to take the Chichibu Maru to Japan and return to his duties, as his vacation is over. The ship is scheduled to depart from Shanghai tomorrow morning at 5:00 AM.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Swiss National Day Celebrated Yesterday. Swiss Officials and Residents in Shanghai Celebrate Together. <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was Swiss National Day. Swiss officials and residents in Shanghai all took a holiday to celebrate. Mr. and Mrs. Etienne Lardy, the Swiss Chargé d'Affaires and Consul General to China, hosted a grand tea party at the new consulate address, No. 1496 Avenue Joffre, from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM, inviting all Swiss residents in Shanghai. Following the tea party, at 7:00 PM, a dinner dance was held at the Swiss General Association on Lucerne Road in West Shanghai. At the same time, prizes were awarded to the winners of the Swiss residents' shooting competition held last Sunday at the rifle range in Hongkou Park.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Industrial and Commercial Loans Implemented Yesterday; General League of National Products Discusses Fundamental Solutions <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee's 20 million yuan relief loan program was implemented yesterday. The General League of National Products Committee held a membership meeting to discuss fundamental solutions. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Relief Loans Begin Yesterday: The Ministry of Finance allocated 20 million yuan in national treasury bonds, establishing the Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee to manage them and administer the relief loans. (1) The total amount for small credit loans is limited to 5 million yuan. Over 1,500 application forms have been requested after the City Chamber of Commerce forwarded them. However, only a few have been completed and submitted to the committee for review. The committee has decided to first dispatch specialists to investigate the two joint liability firms listed on the forms and the assets of the borrowers before submitting them to the committee for review and approval, and then notifying them of payment. (2) The total amount for mortgage loans is limited to 15 million yuan. Factories and trading firms are independently negotiating. After reaching an agreement, they will submit the applications to the committee for review. If approved, national treasury bonds will be issued as secondary collateral.</p>
<p>National Products Groups Meeting for Discussion: The General League of National Products Committee held its 50th regular meeting yesterday. They discussed fundamental solutions for rescuing industry and commerce. In addition to the representatives who had previously contacted the loan committee reporting on the progress and the Ministry of Finance's approval, the committee also proposed issuing public bonds to stabilize the financial market and providing loans to rescue industry and commerce. However, those were deemed only as temporary measures. The fundamental solution, according to the committee, would be to find an alternative to cash and reform the currency system by having the government issue paper money backed by goods, which would allow for the concentration of cash for national defense and construction. Therefore, they expressed support for the recently published "Theory of Currency Reform" by Chu Huiseng and decided to distribute it to member factories of the national products organizations for detailed study and response within a specified period of time, before further consideration.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Eurasia Company Pioneers New Shaanxi-Chengdu Route; Test Flight Yesterday Morning; Departed at 8:40 AM and Arrived in Xi'an in the Afternoon; To Test Fly from Shaanxi to Hanzhong and Then to Chengdu This Morning <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>In order to facilitate transportation between Sichuan and Shaanxi, the Ministry of Communications specially ordered the Shanghai Eurasia Aviation Corporation to pioneer a new Shaanxi-Chengdu air route last month. After receiving the order, the company's general manager, Li Jingzong, began active preparations and personally inspected the route from Pingliang to Shaanxi last week. After returning to Shanghai, he prepared for the test flight. Now that everything is ready, the company's deputy head of the aviation group, He En'er, Xi'an station director Yang Xingzhong, and pilot Count Pastell, flew a Junkers 34 large aircraft from Longhua Airport at 8:40 AM yesterday to test the entire route. Mr. Li Jingzong originally planned to accompany the flight and inspect the route along the way, but he cancelled his plan due to many important public affairs in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Arrived in Xi'an After 4:00 PM: A reporter from the Huadong News Agency inquired with a company representative at 6:00 PM yesterday, who said that the test flight took off from Longhua Airport at 8:40 AM. The weather was favorable yesterday, making the test flight very smooth. The aircraft was equipped with radio communication equipment and had been reporting its location to Shanghai via telegraph along the way. It passed the capital at 10:05 AM, Zhengzhou at 1:10 PM, and arrived at Xi'an Airport at 4:31 PM, arriving 59 minutes earlier than previous flights, setting a new record.</p>
<p>Overnight in Xi'an, Flying to Chengdu This Morning: According to the company's Secretary Cha, the company already had a route from Luoyang to Xi'an, making the test flight relatively simple. The distance was 1,290 kilometers. However, the company did not have a route from Xi'an to Chengdu, making the test flight more difficult. The distance is unknown due to the lack of test flights, but it is estimated to be around 600 kilometers. The route is mountainous. If the test flight goes smoothly, it will take three hours to complete. The test flight aircraft that departed yesterday will stay overnight in Xi'an and will test fly from Xi'an via Hanzhong to Chengdu at 8:00 AM this morning without stopping.</p>
<p>No Definite News on Formal Opening: The reporter from the Huadong News Agency inquired about the formal launch date after this test flight. According to Secretary Cha, it was rumored the outside had already decided to launch the route on the tenth of this month, but the company would postpone that date if the preparations fell behind.</p>

<h3 id="e94">The Postal and Remittance Bureau Supervisory Committee Established Yesterday; All Supervisors Simultaneously Took Office...Then Held the First Meeting <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Supervisory Committee of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau was established yesterday morning. The supervisors arrived at the bureau to take office, without holding a ceremony. They then held their first meeting. The Ministry of Communications sent Vice Minister Zhang Daofan to attend and provide guidance. During the meeting, they discussed and passed the procedural rules and the next meeting date, adjourning at noon. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Supervisors Take Office: The supervisors who took office at the bureau yesterday were Song Ziliang, Lin Jinyu, Shen Zao, Wu Dajun, Fen, Wang Xiang, Qian Xinzhi, Zhou Pei, and eight others. Huang Zongxiao did not participate due to being abroad. After the supervisors arrived at the bureau, Director Shen Shuyu and others received them in the office to rest. At that time, banking leaders Chen Jian'an, Bei Songsheng, Shen Qing, Qu Jigang, Gu Yigu, Xi Demao, Rao Taoshu, and Zhang Peishen went to offer congratulations, led by Song.</p>
<p>First Meeting: After the supervisors took office, the first meeting was held in the Supervisory Committee room. In addition to the supervisors, the Ministry of Communications sent Vice Minister Zhang Daofan to attend and provide guidance. Postal and Remittance Bureau Director Shen Shuyu and Deputy Director Zhou Shouliang also attended. The meeting recorded the procedural rules and decided to hold the next meeting on September 6th, adjourning at noon. The committee has submitted a document to the Ministry of Communications reporting the process of taking office and holding the first meeting.</p>
<p>Vice Minister Gives Instructions: Vice Minister Zhang delivered an instruction, saying, "I am honored to have been ordered to attend this grand meeting. The Supervisory Committee has a long history before its organization. It was discussed when the Postal Economic System Research Committee was established in the 20th year of the Republic. Recently, the government formulated the organization. The members are leaders in the industrial, commercial, auditing, and accounting fields. Under your guidance and supervision, the savings and remittance business will surely achieve greater results and contribute to the country. However, the savings and remittance business is of great importance to the national economy and should not be aimed at ordinary business methods. Even from the perspective of the savings business alone, our country currently has only over 40 million yuan in savings, which is far behind England and Japan. There is much that needs to be designated and promoted by the members. Today, Minister Zhu is unable to attend due to official business and has asked me to express his gratitude to you and hopes for more guidance and strict exercise of supervisory powers."</p>
<p>Committee Chairman's Speech: Chairman Song delivered an opening speech, saying, "This committee was included in the organizational law at the beginning of the establishment of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau as a special bureau. Due to personnel changes, it has not been realized for a long time. For several years, the savings and remittance business has achieved remarkable results and made daily progress due to the strong position and credibility of the post office and the planning and management of previous authorities. Minister Zhu believes that it is necessary to establish this committee, so he entrusted it to the colleagues of the conference. This committee is officially established today. Although I feel that my talents are limited and the task is heavy, because the savings and remittance business is state-owned and closely related to society and the people, I cannot refuse. I plan to do my best to follow you and collect ideas to benefit the public and contribute to the people. The post office has been operating savings for sixteen years and has improved several times. The savings bureau has expanded to more than 640 branches, and the total amount of savings has reached more than 42.2 million yuan, which can be said to be progress. However, based on the national population, each person saves only one jiao (1/10 of a yuan), which is far behind the average savings of 70 yuan per person in the United Kingdom and 50 yuan per person in Japan. Even in terms of savings, compared with the amount of savings in foreign-run savings institutions in China, we are far behind. Moreover, in terms of percentage, urban savings account for 70%, while rural areas account for only 30%, which is an abnormal development. This is not due to poor planning, but simply because the percentage of rural savings in our country can make rapid progress. The remittance business was established even earlier, but it has not made significant progress in 30 years. According to the statistics of the 22nd year of the Republic, the total amount of remittances was approximately 17.5 million yuan. Although the exchange rate has been reduced, the amount of remittances has not increased sharply. Although there are more and more banks, and all of them are engaged in remittance business, the fees are low, and the procedures are simple, it seems that the savings and remittance bureau is difficult to compete with. In fact, the nature of postal savings and remittance is different from that of ordinary banks. Ordinary banks mostly operate commercial savings and commercial remittances, while postal savings and remittance serve the common people in remote rural areas. Most of our country's banks are located in cities, while rural towns are often absent. As for post offices, they penetrate into the people and are everywhere. It seems that we should use this point to encourage the savings of small people as much as possible and store and transport them to various national construction projects. All countries use savings deposits, and postal savings are one of the sources of funds. Our country has many things to be done and is just in its infancy, so it is difficult to compare. However, if we determine the direction and put the funds into reliable public construction projects and industrial and commercial industries, if we can implement it properly, the development of transportation, the relief of rural decline, and the prosperity of industry and commerce will surely benefit greatly. But on the other hand, we must be especially cautious about the use of funds, because postal savings and remittances are mostly the hard-earned money of the working people, accumulated bit by bit through saving and frugality. This type of savings should be given the greatest possible protection to avoid any loss, so that the public will have a deeper faith in postal savings, which will also encourage people to save. The mission of this committee is extremely important. In terms of responsibility, it is not only responsible to the government, but also to the people who deposit savings, so that the savings and remittance bureau takes the interests of the people and uses appropriate methods to apply it to the people. The greatest mission of the savings and remittance business is to seek welfare for the people, not just to make profits. The postal savings and remittance business has achieved remarkable results since the establishment of the special bureau. At present, Director Shen, Deputy Director Zhou, and the colleagues in the bureau are making every effort to operate and regulate the bureau, and the future development is immeasurable. This is indeed a very fortunate thing. Today, this committee is established, which happens to be in the hot summer. We are grateful to Minister Zhu for sending Representative Zhang Daofan to participate and guide, and colleagues from afar have come to participate in the ceremony. I am very happy. I am not well-versed in scholarship, and I am willing to follow you and encourage each other to live up to the government's appointment and the expectations of the people who deposit savings."</p>

All civilian ships in a region, regardless of their nature or transportation, should be gathered under one organization. Currently, the civilian shipping industry associations in this city, which are engaged in water transportation, are organized separately according to the different natures of patrol transportation, which is not in accordance with the law and should be completely abolished. The Shanghai Civilian Shipping Industry Association should be merged and organized to achieve unity. In addition to sending a letter to the Social Bureau for reference and ordering Xu Hantong and other fifteen people to be preparatory members of the Civilian Shipping Industry Association, and issuing orders to the Sand Boat Industry, Coal and Stone Barge Transportation Industry, Fishing Boat Sand Transportation Industry, and Lime Transportation Industry to abolish the organization and report, a list of the preparatory members of the Civilian Shipping Industry Association is also issued, ordering the associations to comply with the order, immediately abolish the organization, handle the handover, and report the abolition of the previously issued license and the instruction to prove the sound organization.

<h3 id="e98">The Insurance Society Will Be Established Tomorrow <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Insurance Society was first initiated by Mr. Luo Beichen, manager of the Wuhan District of the Life Insurance Department of the China Insurance Company, and others in Hankou. After three months of preparation, it began to take shape. In early July, Mr. Luo came to Shanghai and, after more than ten days of effort, invited dozens of people, including Song Hanzhang, Zhang Mingxin, Ding Xuernong, Lu Yuequan, Liang Chenlan, Hu Yongqi, Zhu Rutang, Xu Kesheng, Wang Xiaowen, and Zhang Sumin, to participate in the initiation. The inaugural meeting is scheduled to be held tomorrow (3rd) at 4:00 PM at the Hua An Building on the second floor. The origins and the inaugural meeting notice are as follows:</p>
<p>Origins: Theory is the guide of facts, and facts are the evidence of theory. This is undeniable. Therefore, with a new theory, the old environment will always be transformed and new theories will be produced. The two are mutually causal, because theory without facts is empty talk, and facts without theory are difficult to exemplify. People in Europe, America, and Japan understand this principle very well. In their countries, scholars and entrepreneurs always communicate and work together, organizing various societies for joint research, so that all careers and academics can move forward along a certain right track. Our country lags behind in everything. Fortunately, in recent years, we have gradually begun to transform various emerging social undertakings, exploring principles and building realities. The number of great scholars and entrepreneurs is gradually increasing, but scholars are scholars, and entrepreneurs are entrepreneurs. Theory and facts are often incompatible, or even go in opposite directions. It is not easy to get the two to complement each other. This is the main reason why our country's facts cannot progress rapidly. Now, taking the insurance industry as an example, through the mutual efforts of scholars and entrepreneurs in Europe and the United States, the general public has deeply realized that the insurance industry is a perfect economic organization, a mutual social service, a national strategy for establishing oneself and others, and a financial system with solid assets. Therefore, the insurance industry is booming and has grasped the world's great economic authority and established a solid foundation for people's livelihood. Our country's insurance industry has also made considerable progress, but it is still far behind Europe and the United States. When our country's national economy is bankrupt and national construction is backward, we deeply feel that the insurance industry has the need to rise up and take on the responsibility of reversing the situation. Because the insurance industry is a stabilizing technique, transforming the real environment, and establishing the country's permanent economic security. We hope that scholars and insurance entrepreneurs will enthusiastically participate and work hard to make the society flourish and promote the success of the national economic construction movement. This is what we sincerely pray for. Initiators: Song Hanzhang, Zhang Minghuang, Gong Xuernong, Lu Yuequan, Liang Chenlan, Xu Kesheng, Wang Xiaowen, Wei Beichen.</p>
<p>Notice: Dear Sir/Madam, the Chinese Insurance Society is now ready for establishment. It is hereby scheduled to hold the inaugural meeting at 4:00 PM on Saturday, August 3rd (this Saturday) at the Hua An Building on Jing'an Temple Road. Please arrive on time to celebrate the grand occasion. Sincerely, the Preparatory Office of the Chinese Insurance Society.</p>

Mr. Hu's concern for the disaster victims is meticulous and admirable. The municipal government plans to distribute the above-mentioned medicines to various disaster areas as soon as they arrive.</p>
<h3 id="e101">The Taxpayers' Association Re-requests the Municipal Council to Collect General Rates Based on Actual Rent <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Settlement wrote to the Municipal Council, stating, "Dear Sirs, according to a letter from lawyer Cai Guangxu, 'Our client, the Guoxin Bank, leased two ground-floor rooms in the south of the Securities Building at No. 422 Hankou Road from the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange in March of this year as its business address, stipulating a monthly rent of 800 silver dollars, or 9,600 yuan per year, and paying property rates (commonly known as police rates) at 14%, which should be 112 silver dollars per month, or 1,344 yuan per year. Unexpectedly, the Municipal Council's Rates Office did not collect rates according to the actual rent, but insisted on estimating and raising the value to 16,000 yuan per year, requiring a monthly payment of 186.66 yuan, or 2,242 yuan per year, which is almost double the actual rent. Our client naturally could not agree to this according to the law. After discussing with them, there was no effect. Our lawyer then consulted with Mr. Bourne, the director of the Rates Office, several times, and he once agreed to reduce the estimated value of 16,000 yuan by 20% (i.e., to 12,800 yuan), but our client believed that this violated the law and could not accept it. Then, our lawyer sent a written statement to the Municipal Council, stating that this dispute could be resolved by the court, but the Council ignored it and instead sent a letter stating that the case had been sent to the Property Rates Assessment Committee for review. Unexpectedly, on July 11th, we received a letter from Mr. Phillips, acting secretary-general of the Council, stating that the committee had assessed the rent of the Guoxin Bank at 17,000 yuan per year. After reading this, we were shocked. Afterwards, our lawyer went to the Municipal Council's Rates Office to inquire about this method and the reasons for the decision, but was told that the assessment of the committee did not announce the reasons. In the future, if the Guoxin Bank resists the rates, they will have other methods to enforce them without requesting the court. However, in order to save the bank's face, they may report to senior officials (referring to the secretary-general) that due to the current economic downturn, the rates will be collected at the original rate of 16,000 yuan for the time being, and the full amount will be collected when business gradually improves. Our client has several doubts about this method of the Municipal Council, which we will try to explain to your Council: (1) The Property Rates Assessment Committee is neither an independent body nor recognized by our Chinese Ratepayers' Association. The committee is actually under the direction and payroll of the Municipal Council. Its nature is merely an advisor to the Council. No taxpayer in the settlement should be bound by it, especially since the assessment does not include reasons, which obviously lacks a legal basis; (2) The Municipal Council collects property rates, except for self-owned property, which is calculated at 14% of the actual rent. Now, it is forcibly estimating the value for our client, exceeding the regulations by almost double, which is undoubtedly arbitrary and excessive; (3) The amount of the value is based on a certain object (movable and immovable property), and the value is determined by both the seller or lessor and the buyer or lessee. There is a transaction, and there is also a market price. The Guoxin Bank's address has been vacant for more than two years since its completion, and no one has consulted it. During this period, it can be said that there is no value standard. Now, our client leases it from the landlord at a monthly rent of 800 yuan, which is the standard value of this address. Both parties have a contract, and there are rent receipts and account books for reference. If there is an intention to take profits outside the law in order to reduce property rates, our client is willing to be punished according to the law; (4) The Municipal Council has issued notices and distributed forms to all landlords and property management offices to investigate the actual amount of rent as the standard for collecting property rates. Therefore, the Municipal Council's collection of rates should be based on rent, which is undoubtedly true; (5) The Council even said that it has other methods to enforce it, which is nothing more than stopping the supply of water and electricity. Regardless of whether this method is legal, the public utilities that serve the public interest are used as weapons by the Council to oppress taxpayers, which also violates the public opinion of taxpayers. If it is implemented, the losses suffered by our client as a result should be borne by the Council. The above points are all that we cannot refrain from saying. This Council's increase in the assessment of rent and the increase in the collection of property rates, which exceeds 24% of what should be paid, is shocking. If we do not find a way to stop it, not only will the Council use it as an example in the future, but it will gradually increase property rates for other Chinese and foreign residents, and even the owners will increase rents based on the Council's assessment. Once this trend starts, disputes will arise repeatedly. In this autumn of declining industries and impoverishment of the people, how can we bear the burden of repeated oppression, or incidents may occur as a result, and the consequences may be difficult to deal with. This is not just a matter of concern for our client. Therefore, we hereby report to your Council, requesting your Council to seriously negotiate with the Municipal Council to cancel the illegal increase in rates.' After the above situation was reported to the Council, the Council found that the collection of municipal general rates without following the actual rent has been repeatedly corrected by the Council. If your Council, for the sake of the taxpayers, considers the number of rents estimated by the land price regulations to be lower than the market price (i.e., the actual rent), and this was done more than ten years ago, although the Council believes that it should collect rates based on the actual rent according to law and reason, it does not object to your Council's benevolent governance. However, now, without collecting rates based on the actual rent, you want to overestimate the rent in order to increase the rates, which means that your Council is only considering financial interests and disregarding law and reason, which the Council finds very regrettable. The Council saw several years ago that the Shanghai market would inevitably decline day by day, and the number of vacant houses would inevitably increase day by day. It sent a letter requesting your Council to make changes to its financial plan to avoid becoming a sequel to Chicago. In order to reduce the expenses of the useless and unprofitable music team for the vast majority of taxpayers, the Council also considered the financial situation of your Council and resolved at the Congress in the 13th year of the Republic of China that 'general rates should be collected for vacant houses,' as the regulations on the land of the Yangjingbang do not prohibit the collection of general rates for vacant houses, just as land must also be taxed. However, your Council does not implement this, and it must overestimate the rent for the general rates that have actual rent in order to increase it. Is it necessary to make the houses rented by the few remaining businesses become the houses of Hardoon Yanghang on Nanjing Road and Pingzhiming Yanghang on Hankou Road and make taxes protect them? As for the Valuation Committee, it wastes taxpayers' taxes and has no basis in fundamental law. In the opinion of the taxpayers, it is equal to a court's judgment. The issue of authority is very serious and should be given special consideration by your Council. According to the letter, please send a letter to your Council as soon as possible, unless there is a notarized report, to collect the general rates of the Guoxin Bank according to the actual rent."</p>
<h3 id="e102">Various Charity Groups Receive Pleas for Aid <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>News from the Sino-Foreign Relief Committee: (A) Chairman Han of Jinan Replied: "To the esteemed Sino-Foreign Relief Committee, your telegram of the 30th has been received. The Yellow River has burst its banks, causing widespread flooding and disaster. Starving refugees cry out across the desolate landscape. We are deeply grateful that the Daode Society Relief Group has not abandoned us and has come to Shandong to provide relief. Our government and all the affected people are profoundly moved. We will follow your instructions and provide sincere hospitality. Please convey our heartfelt thanks. Day and night, until the afternoon of the 7th, the water depth on the plains reached four to five feet. The next day, mountain floods erupted, and the Dan and Xi Rivers surged simultaneously, rushing violently. The water level rose to over twenty feet. Furthermore, due to the narrow mountain rivers downstream and poor communication, the water accumulated higher and higher, eventually engulfing mountains and hills, creating a boundless expanse. Within our county, from Xizhen in the west to Liguanqiao in the east, a total distance of over one hundred *li* (approximately 30 miles) became a vast ocean, turning into a state of flooding. Residents either clung to trees, wooden houses, or fled to the mountains. Those who were old or weak and unable to escape were swept away with their homes, livestock, and food. In total, over one hundred villages in the county were affected, with none spared. Among them, Zhangzhuang, Wangying, Shuanghezhen, and over one hundred other towns suffered particularly severe inundation, with former dwellings transformed into raging torrents. In Liguanqiao Town, the flood breached the walls, and the water depth inside the walls exceeded ten feet, resulting in the deaths of no less than four thousand people. In areas such as Bating, hailstorms occurred simultaneously, killing trees, injuring people and livestock, and the situation is beyond description. The water depth in the city reached five to six feet, and most of the houses collapsed. The county government only has a dozen or so remaining civilian houses. As one can imagine, the current water level has slightly decreased, but all the people in the county are on the verge of starvation and death. The cries of the afflicted fill the land, a scene of unparalleled devastation, causing heartache and tears. In addition to submitting a request to various organizations in the province for immediate relief, we are sending this special telegram to implore you to provide generous aid." (B) A telegram from Wang Shiliu, the Sixth District Administrative Director of Hubei Province, states: "Investigations reveal that continuous rain has caused a disaster, with the Xiang River rising sharply and floods reaching thirty to forty feet, turning the plains into swamps. Guanghua, Gucheng, Xiangyang, Yicheng, and other counties along the river have suffered severely from the floods. Ripening crops have been completely submerged, and countless lives have been transformed into fish and shrimp. The cities and towns of Laohekou and Fancheng, known as the commercial centers of northern Hubei, have seen more than half of their houses collapse, and goods have been completely washed away. The devastation is unprecedented. Although the floods have subsided, countless displaced persons are without clothing or food. In Fancheng alone, there are still over thirty thousand people. The situation elsewhere can be imagined. The cries of the starving fill the land, awaiting immediate assistance. We are sending this special telegram to appeal for urgent relief to save the dying people."</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Donations from All Sectors. Upon hearing the news of the floods in the Yellow River and Yangtze River regions, various sectors at home and abroad have automatically donated funds for relief, which have been remitted to the committee for distribution. This demonstrates a warm spirit of charity. Furthermore, Zhou Hongen of Anhui County wrote a letter stating: "Respectfully, due to the bandit Sun's attack on Bozhou in October of the 14th year of the Republic (1925), the entire city was in difficulty. Fortunately, the Sino-Foreign Relief Committee, the Relief Association, and the World Red Swastika Society, organized by various philanthropists, and the Yuan Daoyin, who presided over the temporary emergency relief efforts, rescued the people, allowing them to survive and the dead to be buried. At that time, I received five yuan in relief funds from your organization to bury my late father. I am deeply grateful. Now, I am sending ten yuan via the post office to be allocated to the severely affected disaster areas to save the survivors."</p>
<p>China Relief Society. We have recently received a report from Zhang Lanfen, chairman of the embankment engineering committee of Huaining County, and committee member Song Shancheng, and others, stating that in the Hushan Township area of the First District of Huaining County, Anhui Province, from Majiadian, Laohuta, Zhujiadun, Shuanghekou, Jiangjiadian, Liushulin, Jijiadun, Changbujia, and other places, totaling thirty *li* (approximately 9 miles) along the river, ten large and small embankments have been breached by violent tides since the beginning of last month until the end of the month. The people, who had already suffered greatly from last year's drought, made extraordinary efforts to repair the embankments, working day and night, but were unable to prevent the breaches. The loss of embankment materials is estimated to be over ten thousand yuan. The embankments have still collapsed, resulting in widespread flooding, inundating countless fields and houses, and carrying away people, livestock, and coffins in uncountable numbers. There is not a single dry spot within the flooded area. The affected people are climbing onto roofs and trees for temporary shelter. Last year there was a drought, and this year there is flooding, disaster upon disaster, an unprecedented occurrence. This has led to the tragedy of the young and strong fleeing, and the old and weak perishing in ditches. Currently, the affected people are unable to get a full meal every day and are desperately hoping for relief. We are sending a special telegram to implore you to provide generous assistance, quickly allocate large sums of money, and send personnel to provide relief to save the remaining survivors." According to previous reports, the disasters in Hubei, Henan, and Shandong provinces are severe. Many embankments in Anhui Province have been breached and urgently need rescue. In previous years, the society has spent no less than hundreds of thousands of yuan on relief efforts in various counties of Anhui, including Yi, Wu, Anqing, and northern Anhui. Now, another severe flood has occurred. It is hoped that benevolent compatriots will generously donate to save these helpless survivors.</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday notified various trade guilds, stating: "Respectfully, we received a letter from the Chinese National Cigarette Maintenance Association on the 30th of this month stating: 'In recent years, the business of domestically produced cigarettes has been declining day by day. The association, as a pioneer in promoting domestic products and a driving force in protecting domestic industries, was officially established on the 19th of this month and has been guided by your esteemed chamber. However, this matter is of great importance and involves many aspects. It relies on collective wisdom and effort to overcome difficulties. It is hoped that you will inform your respective member guilds to rise up together and work together to maintain the domestic cigarette industry, so that the future of domestic products will become brighter and more prosperous. The beneficiaries will not only be the domestic cigarette industry.' The chamber has instructed the personnel in charge of purchasing cigarettes for customers to only purchase domestic products, and this has been implemented for many years. As the saying goes, 'A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.' This is not difficult to achieve. If the chairmen and standing committee members of various guilds can sincerely instruct their personnel to only purchase domestic cigarettes for customers and pay close attention to this matter at all times, and if there are any violations, they should be instructed to make a change, and if they themselves set an example by only smoking domestic cigarettes, then the trend will change imperceptibly and spread to all members of the industry. In the future, whenever various guilds hold general membership meetings and the chamber sends personnel to provide guidance, attention should also be paid to this matter to see whether the guilds are handling things in a practical manner."</p>

<h3 id="e104">Taxpayers' Association Asks the Municipal Council to Correct Illegal Electricity Charges; Letter from the Chinese and Western Merchandise Trade Market Reveals That the Electricity Company Charges are Not Based on Regulations <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "Respectfully, according to a letter from the Chinese and Western Merchandise Trade Market, 'Our market officially opened at the intersection of Zhian Temple Road and Xizang Road in this city on June 15th. All electricity was supplied by the Shanghai Electric Power Company starting on June 12th, and the market closed on July 14th. The electricity was used for a month and two days, totaling 5,949 kilowatt-hours. The number of kilowatt-hours on the bill sent by the company matches, but the electricity price is calculated at 1.2 silver yuan per kilowatt-hour. According to the company's electricity price list, the first 1,000 kilowatt-hours are charged at 1.2 silver yuan per kilowatt-hour, the next 1,000 kilowatt-hours are charged at 1 silver yuan per kilowatt-hour, the next 1,000 kilowatt-hours are charged at 6.5 *li* (0.0065 silver yuan) per kilowatt-hour, and the next 10,000 kilowatt-hours are charged at 5.5 *li* (0.0055 silver yuan) per kilowatt-hour. According to the above regulations, our market used a total of 5,949 kilowatt-hours, which should cost 501 taels and 1.1 silver yuan. However, the bill sent by the company is calculated at 1.2 silver yuan per kilowatt-hour, totaling 713 taels and 8.88 silver yuan, a difference of 211 taels and 6.8 silver yuan. We have sent a letter stating that we should correct the charges according to the electricity price regulations in order to resolve the matter. However, the company not only withheld the deposit paid by our market, but also replied on the 24th in a letter from the Deputy Secretary and Assistant General Accountant Mr. Hammon, stating, "I have received your letter of the 21st of this month regarding the temporary electricity bill for the New World building at No. 1 Jing'an Temple Road. I understand. After investigation, the bill is indeed calculated based on the price of this type of lighting. In this case, the company is unable to modify the bill. We are replying accordingly." The electricity price problem was still unresolved, so on the morning of the 26th, Mr. Dong Juesun, director of our market, personally went to the company to negotiate with the person in charge. However, the Chinese staff of the company did not know what regulations this calculation was based on, so they could not answer. Later, we went to the person in charge, a Westerner, who said that this electricity fee was calculated entirely according to Article 32 of the Shanghai Electric Power Company's Electricity Supply Rules. However, after checking the text of Article 32 of the rules, it concerns the method of electricity supply, but the calculation of electricity fees should still be based on the terms listed in the company's electricity price list. According to these regulations, the electricity fee should be charged according to the amount stipulated in the electricity price list, which is the correct method. However, the company relies on its monopoly power and disregards the regulations. Although we have repeatedly requested according to the regulations, it has refused to accept. Therefore, we have no choice but to attach a copy of the company's electricity price list and a copy of the company's electricity supply rules, and to inform you of the various situations in which our market has been illegally oppressed and forced to pay more for electricity. We implore your council to review the matter and immediately request that the Shanghai Electric Power Company, a public utility under your supervision, correct its illegal charges in accordance with the electricity price list and electricity supply rules, so as to prevent such illegal incidents from happening to the people of the city, and to resolve the dispute over the illegal mandatory surcharge on electricity fees for our market as soon as possible.' Article 32 of the Shanghai Electric Power Company's Electricity Supply Rules states, 'For temporary, short-term, or special electricity supply, this type of electricity supply can only be provided based on the terms listed in the price list and when the company has surplus power, transformers, generators, and other equipment that have not been sold.' Now that the time for supply has passed, the phrase 'and' to 'when' is not a problem. The problem is the price list on which it is based. If the Shanghai Electric Power Company only has one price list, which has been approved by your bureau, then even if this is short-term, it should be charged according to commercial lighting, which is undoubtedly legal. It is difficult to avoid miscalculations in calculating prices. The company does not correct the error even after the user has corrected it. It is obviously relying on the special privileges granted by taxpayers to seek illegal income or unjust enrichment. Based on the above, we hereby request that your bureau exercise the supervisory powers conferred by taxpayers in accordance with the law and immediately correct the above-mentioned errors of the Shanghai Electric Power Company to protect the legal interests of users. This is our earnest hope. Furthermore, the Shanghai Electric Company should use silver yuan as the standard for pricing. This is addressed to Mr. Fei, Acting Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession."</p>

<p>Shop Employees Describe What They Witnessed; All Three Thieves Give Evasive Testimony</p>
<p>The Great Prosperity Foreign Goods Store at 2063 Yangshupu Road, the Yuan Tai Chang Southern Goods Store at 2057 on the same road, and the Shanghai East Shoe and Hat Store at 15 Linqing Road were robbed of goods worth over 400 yuan by a large number of robbers at 8:30 PM the day before yesterday. The robbers fired warning shots when fleeing, and stray bullets injured a woman passing by. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Subsequently, Hua Detective Sun Afu, Detective Supervisor Su Yinggen, and Detective Wang Renzhong of the Yangshupu Police Station arrested three robbers, Zhao Baosheng, Xia Shoushan, and Gao Zikui, all from Funing, in the Lan Road and Hejian Road area. Fifteen yuan and two jiao were found on Zhao, seven yuan and two jiao on Xia, and nine yuan and seven jiao on Gao. All were taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer for the Municipal Council, stated the previous circumstances and requested a postponement. Following this, a report from the Chinese and Western detectives explained the circumstances of the arrest of the three defendants. A bullet found in the Great Prosperity Foreign Goods Store and the stolen money were presented to the court. Mi Xiangsheng, an employee of the Yuan Tai Chang Southern Goods Store, stated that three robbers entered at the time, two of whom had pistols, and identified the defendant Xia Shoushan as having robbed the store. Xiao Shousheng, an employee of the Great Prosperity Foreign Goods Store, stated that three robbers entered at the time, one of whom was outside the door acting as a lookout, and fired a shot when fleeing. The defendant Zhao Baosheng was present at the scene. Furthermore, an employee of the Zhang Maochang store stated that the appearance and clothing of the robber who was acting as a lookout outside the door were similar to those of the defendant Gao Zikui. At the time, a customer came to the store to buy goods, and the robber was watching him, preventing him from leaving. An apprentice in the store tried to move to the outside, and the robber fired a shot, but fortunately, it missed. Wu Dekun, an employee of the Linqing Road Shanghai East Shoe Store, stated that six robbers came at the time, all of whom had pistols, and identified the defendant Gao Zikui as being at the scene. When questioned, the three defendants gave evasive denials. Judge Xiao Xiefei ordered them to remain in custody for further investigation.</p>

<p>Includes Powerful Dum-Dum Bullets; Three Thieves with Illegal Intentions Arrested</p>
<p>Hua Detective Shang Wu and Detective Supervisor Wang Youshan of the Huishi Police Station learned at around 7:00 AM on the 31st of last month that a gang of thieves was gathering at the intersection of Xiamen Road and Zhejiang Road, plotting illegal activities. They immediately went to the location with Western detectives and arrested three thieves, Li Caigen, from Tongzhou, Xia Jinsheng, a local, and Du Atong (also known as Tong ?, from Pudong). Two pistols and thirteen bullets, including five Dum-Dum bullets, were found in a shoebox behind Li's No. 16948 bicycle. The bullets are very powerful, exploding upon firing. All were taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer for the Municipal Council, stated the previous circumstances and charged the three defendants with violating Article 1 of the Regulations for the Prohibition of Military Firearms and Weapons, and stated that the defendants said at the police station that the guns and bullets belonged to Yan Changgen, who lived at 1639, Lane 586, Yinxiang Port.

Chen Mengyu was sentenced to three years' imprisonment for attempted extortion, but was found not guilty of the charge of manufacturing explosives. Song Nianhong and Zhu Wangshi were each sentenced to three months' imprisonment, suspended for three years. Wu Depei was found not guilty. Song and Zhu were each released on bail pending appeal.</p>

<p>Court Autopsied Yesterday</p>
<p>At noon the day before yesterday, a well-digging fire occurred at the home of Mr. Harris, a manager at the British American Tobacco Company, at 251 Yuni Gan Road, at the western end of Daxi Road in Shanghai. Two laborers were burned, one fatally and one injured. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper.

They were sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment. Wu Arong died at around 4:00 PM yesterday, and Li Zhifu died at 7:30 AM this morning. He therefore reported to request an autopsy. After receiving the report, the court immediately commissioned Prosecutor Zhao Chuanjia and Examiner Xuan Zhiming to conduct an autopsy, confirming that the deaths were caused by burns. The families were instructed to arrange for coffins and burials.</p>

<p>The leaders of the kidnappers, Yan Shibiao and Yan Shiqing from Suqian, are brothers. They had committed numerous crimes in their hometown and were wanted by the authorities. Knowing that it was difficult to gain a foothold in their hometown, Yan Shibiao and others fled to Shanghai last month and remained at large. Zou Zhendong and Wang Rongzhang, officers of the District Court, learned that the two bandits were hiding in the countryside of Gaoqiao and Donggou in Pudong. They quietly notified the Donggou Police Station and sent police to arrest them. Yan Shiqing was arrested first and immediately taken to the station for detention. Next, Officer Zou and Wang went to the Gaoqiao Branch Bureau, stated the situation, and requested additional police to arrest the bandit leader Yan Shibiao. The police chief of the station approved the request. Yesterday morning, the police chief ordered several armed police officers to escort the bandit leader Yan Shibiao to the District Court for questioning. Prosecutor Kong Xianglin questioned him and ordered him to be held in custody.</p>
<h3 id="e115">French Concession Police Raid Rickshaws Yesterday <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Rickshaw Company Representatives Petitioned the City Government, Rickshaw Pullers Held a Meeting Yesterday Vowing Strong Opposition</p>
<p>According to sources in the rickshaw business, since the French Concession announced rickshaw registration, a month has passed. Rickshaw pullers are dissatisfied with the registration process, and the registration fees are too burdensome. They unanimously refused to register. The French authorities took coercive measures and decisively acted, dispatching a large number of detectives starting at 9:00 AM yesterday morning to seize rickshaws and order pullers to register. The pullers abandoned their rickshaws and refused to register. The police stations were filled with impounded rickshaws, totaling seven to eight hundred. Having lost their livelihoods after their rickshaws were seized, the pullers, leading the old and young, requested assistance from the Rickshaw Trade Association and various charities along the way.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Company Meeting</p>
<p>Regarding the French Concession seizing rickshaws, rickshaw owners held a large meeting at 9:00 AM yesterday on Sanguantang Road to discuss countermeasures. Over three hundred owners attended. Resolutions were passed: (1) To sympathize with the pullers' demands to protect their business, a united action will be taken. (2) The obligation of rickshaws in business is to pay taxes. Rickshaw puller registration is a separate issue. Vehicle taxes have not been reduced, yet the French Concession is preventing rickshaws from operating because of the puller registration problem. The French Municipal Council should bear the responsibility for the resulting damages and disputes. (3) To oppose the French Concession's high-handed measures. (4) Representatives Qiu Chunshan, Zhang Huaiyang, and Yu Dajin were elected to petition the city government.</p>
<p>Representatives' Petition</p>
<p>The rickshaw company representatives Qiu Chunshan, Zhang Huaiyang, Yu Dajin, etc., took a petition to the Municipal Government's Bureau of Social Affairs at 2:00 PM yesterday. Representatives were sent to meet them. The representatives stated the rickshaw companies' difficulties and requested the government to consider the pullers' livelihoods and protect the rickshaw companies' business. The Bureau of Social Affairs representatives agreed to forward their concerns to the French authorities for consideration. The representatives left satisfied.</p>
<p>Petition</p>
<p>The petition is excerpted below: Submitted regarding the French Concession Police Department forcing rickshaw puller registration, impounding rickshaws, and prohibiting operation, leaving pullers unable to settle down, and the situation is tense, requesting negotiations to stop this to prevent accidents. The French Concession Police Department announced that since the public rickshaw puller registration began last month, the association believes the pullers are ignorant and, upon hearing the news, unanimously expressed that they would rather beg than register. After repeated requests, the association asked them to stop this but the French authorities ignored public opinion and did not change the method. They intensified their actions against the 1,100 French-licensed rickshaws (numbers 16001 to 17100) that were not registered last month. From today, the police will impound them one by one and force the pullers and owners to register at the police station, with 700 to 800 rickshaws being seized. More than 1,000 pullers suddenly became unemployed, and public sentiment reached a boiling point. They came to the association requesting relief. The association has repeatedly and earnestly advised them to wait for a solution, but the situation is urgent, and social order is greatly affected. Therefore, we specially recommend representatives Qiu Chunshan, Zhang Huaiyang, and Yu Dajin to petition Your Excellency (Bureau) to immediately negotiate with the French Concession authorities to stop this and prevent accidents to maintain social order, in anticipation of your urgent orders.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers' Meeting Following the rickshaw seizures by the French police, the number of unemployed has increased dramatically, and the situation is extremely serious. A mass meeting was held at 1:00 PM yesterday at the South Wharf. Shi Changsheng was elected chairman. Resolutions were passed: (1) To unanimously oppose registration. (2) To elect representatives to request assistance from party and government organizations and the rickshaw trade association. (3) In secret. It is also heard that the rickshaw pullers' representatives will hold a large petition at the Municipal Government's Bureau of Social Affairs and relevant parties today.</p>
<p>News from the French Police Station. The French Concession authorities, because rickshaw owners are organized to obstruct rickshaw puller registration, implemented the measures published in the newspapers on the 26th of last month, seizing 215 rickshaws that should have been registered in July. Because French police officers used peaceful means, no accidents occurred. After questioning by police officers at the police station, some pullers said they did not receive orders from their owners, so they did not register, or said they did not know registration had started. Some said their owners did not allow them to register. The Chinese and foreign newspapers have recently published many reports on this issue, but they are not entirely accurate. They are presented separately as follows: (1) The French Concession authorities have no intention of restricting the number of rickshaws and have explained to rickshaw owners that all pullers will be registered, regardless of the number of pullers. (2) The French Concession authorities have proven through various sources that the rickshaw pullers' resistance to registration and various incitements and rumors are caused by rickshaw owners, and not the pullers' own intention. Rickshaw owners are simply misunderstanding that once rickshaw pullers are registered, their power to inspect the pullers will be deprived. However, yesterday, many rickshaw pullers voluntarily registered according to the regulations set by the French Concession authorities.</p>

<p>Violates the Original Intention of National Legislation Restricting It</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, saying: "To the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing: As a result of the implementation of our country's new criminal law on July 1, the International Savings Society has closed its inland branches in non-treaty ports. Depositors everywhere are very anxious about their previous deposits and have repeatedly sent letters to the association to inquire about news. The association forwarded inquiries to the International Savings Society, which replied that it hopes depositors will deposit their due deposits at local branches. Although the inland branches have been closed, the inland deposits have not been ended, and the collection has not been stopped. Depositors must send their deposits monthly to their branches, which are relatively far apart, resulting in more trouble and expense. It has been found that foreign merchants operating inland business has always been strictly prohibited by treaties. Now, by closing branches, the name of inland business is cleverly avoided, but the deposits have not been ended, and the reality of inland business is still maintained, which is not permitted by the treaty. For the sake of depositors and the treaty, Your Ministry should have a way to properly handle this situation; otherwise, it will only cause suffering to the inland depositors, and it will not help the original intention of national legislation restricting it. Should negotiations be held with the French side to order the end of the collection of inland deposits and the return of the deposits? We await instructions for compliance.

<h3 id="e122">Conclusion of Trial of Two Women Arguing Over Child <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Will Be Pronounced on the 5th of This Month Who Will Ultimately Have Custody Is Unknown</p>
<p>Chen Zhou, the wife of the late real estate tycoon and Catholic Chen Yide, residing at No. 260 Belle Road, French Concession, was sued in the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court by Chen Yipei, his husband's mistress residing at No. 2 Jiusili, Pushi Road, through lawyer, to return her biological son, Xiong Guan (also known as Nengyi). After repeated hearings by Judge Ma Yishu of the court, because the testimonies of both parties insisted that the child was their own biological child, it was decided that both parties should bring the child and send them to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for scientific identification. The result was that both defendants had the possibility of giving birth to Chen Xiong Guan, and it was proven that the defendant Chen Zhou had indeed been pregnant and given birth before. After replying to the court, the plaintiff requested an investigation into the Ten Thousand Years Book at the Catholic Church to prove whether Chen Zhou had given birth to children, since Chen Yide was a Catholic and should have registered his children in accordance with church regulations. This matter has been reported in the newspapers many times. This case was again heard by Judge Ma of the Second Special District Court yesterday. The plaintiff Chen Yipei and her lawyer were present in court. The defendant Chen Zhou was represented by a lawyer. The court announced that after the court had investigated the Catholic Church, the reply stated that Chen Yide was not a member of the church, and there was no way to investigate the child's registration. The plaintiffs' representatives, Zhang Ding, Ma Nangeng, and Peng Qixiu, stood up one after another and stated that during the trial, obstetrician He Cuizhen had testified, proving that the plaintiff had given birth and that she had delivered the baby. Photos of the plaintiff and Chen Yide when they lived together and with Xiong Guan were presented. The appraisal report of the Forensic Institute is vague on all points of the appraisal, saying that both parties can produce Chen Xiong Guan, and the result has no basis and can be ignored. As for the appearance and skeletal structure, although it is recognized in science that there is no accurate identification by Jiaoxue Qian, it can be found that the First Special District Court has a case in which Zhang Zhuying and Zhou confirmed their biological son. The institute identified the appearance and anatomical position as essential elements of heredity, which is obviously unfair and difficult to convince. It is requested that another expert be selected for re-identification, and that the defendant be ordered to bring Xiong Guan to the court for comparison with the plaintiff in court, so that the court can freely determine who to believe. Judge Ma ruled that the Forensic Institute is sponsored by the Ministry of Justice and Administration, and there is no need for further inspection. Chen Xiong Guan's photos have also been presented, and there is no need to summon him to court. At this point, the court considered the investigation of evidence to be complete, the facts to be clear, and then ordered the start of the debate. The lawyers of both sides debated each other, and the arguments were quite fierce. It took an hour before they stopped. The court declared the debate over and scheduled the pronouncement for 10:00 AM on the 5th of this month, and then adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Shanghai Public Organizations Present Cai Kong to Maintain Wang Binyan <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Preserving the Local Area and Bankrolling Was Approved by Jiangsu Province</p>
<p>Xu Mao, Lin Kanghou, and Shen Yongshi, representatives of public organizations in Shanghai, presented to Cai Kong regarding Wang Binyan, head of the Zhabei Defense Corps, preserving the local area and bankrolling, and the contract establishing State Manufacturing Bureau property as collateral, because Wang's bankruptcy has been forced. The original text reads: (Omitted above) The investigation found that in October of the 13th year of the Republic of China, on the night the Jiangsu-Zhejiang war ended, more than 40,000 troops and more than 10,000 refugees suddenly came to Zhabei. People were panicked, and order was chaotic. Wang Binyan, head of the Zhabei Defense Corps, repeatedly received telegrams from Han Guojun, the former governor of Jiangsu Province and the director of military rehabilitation, ordering him to maintain the local area, provide rations for the troops, and raise funds for cooking, which was approved as a regular expenditure item. At that time, local officials had fled, and the police wages had not been paid. The Chamber of Commerce had not yet been established, and all factories had stopped work. In the name of the Zhabei Charity Corps, he appealed for loans, which were all handled by Wang Binyan, with great results. The local area was spared from ruin, and the people were spared from disaster. The total amount of bankrolled silver dollars was 228,649.70, which was registered and reported for approval. Subsequently, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance was sent to Shanghai to sign a contract and inform the Ministry of the Army for the record, with all the land of the State-owned Shanghai Manufacturing Bureau as collateral. To date, no money has been returned. However, in this bankrolled amount, Wang Binyan mortgaged his personal residence property deed to Guangdong Bank, Hong Kong National Bank, and Cunde Qianzhuang for 10,000 taels of silver each. To date, more than ten years have passed, and calculated at one principal and one interest, he owes a total of 60,000 taels of silver, equivalent to 84,000 yuan. It has been mortgaged repeatedly, and now the three villages have been terminated. Unless the money is returned in full, the property will be seized and sold and he will be unable to live there. The businesses were located in Zhabei and handled this matter together. The eyes of Wang Binyan are sharp. He was forced to act in the public interest, preserving the local area. He has served as the director of the Zhabei Charity Corps and the head of the Defense Corps throughout his life. He has been honest and has no savings. Under the pressure of this predicament, he is facing the worry of his entire family going bankrupt. According to public opinion, they are all willing to appeal for him. It has been explained to Shanghai Local Association President Du Yuesheng, who also said that as a public duty for all of Shanghai, there are many who have taken on local responsibilities, and it is too unjust to allow Wang Binyan to be in such a difficult situation without help. In addition to asking President Du to personally ask the minister for relief, this public presentation has been prepared, with a photographic contract attached, requesting Your Ministry to consider that the Shanghai Manufacturing Bureau is state-owned property, which has already been mortgaged on record. Could you please approve the prior return of a portion, which Wang Binyan will claim, and the rest will be settled later when the finances are more prosperous. The merchants are speaking out righteously to prove for Wang Binyan that it was indeed his private property that was hastily mortgaged and transferred for local public use. There is a contract with the seal and signature of Han Guojun, the former governor of Jiangsu Province and the director of military rehabilitation, and there is also a contract stating that the Ministry of the Army was informed for the record, with no fabrication. We hereby declare and present this to Minister of Finance Kong, with a photographic contract attached.

<p>Chuan Yihao from Yin County, Zhejiang Province, is only in his early twenties. In the spring of the previous year, he married Ye Xiuzhen through a matchmaker. At that time, Ye was only sixteen years old and had been especially loved by her parents since childhood. Therefore, since her marriage with Chuan, she had not been accustomed to the etiquette that the old family should abide by. Although the couple was very harmonious, the relationship between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law was not. Last spring, Chuan wanted to please his beloved wife and moved to his wife's house, which made his old mother feel even more lonely. In January of this year, Chuan found a job at the De Cheng Silk Store in this city and brought Ye and their two-year-old child to Shanghai, renting a house at No. 21 Jingxingli, Avenue Edward VII, thinking that she had finally fulfilled her long-cherished wish to form a small family and could be harmonious. Unexpectedly, she became more and more dissolute. If Chuan occasionally added pressure, she would use fighting. One day, while Chuan was away from home to go to the store, she took her clothes and went to the Jiliang Institute on Guizhou Road, reporting to the institute that Chuan had abused her and made it impossible to cohabitate and begged for assistance. The institute notified Chuan to go for mediation, but Ye's attitude was even stronger. Chuan rushed back to his hometown, asking his relatives and friends and his old mother to come to Shanghai, hoping to persuade her to return to peace. Ye initially asked her husband to write a voluntary cohabitation note and return on time. However, when the deadline arrived and Chuan went to the institute to welcome her, she went back on her word and insisted on divorcing Chuan, leaving the peacemakers helpless. Chuan hired lawyer Cao Lin to file a request with the Civil Mediation Office of the First Special District Court to order her to continue to cohabitate, but the result was still ineffective. Now he has formally filed a lawsuit for cohabitation. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang opened the court. The defendant Ye Xiuling was lying in the hospital due to illness and failed to report to the court. The plaintiff's representative lawyer finished stating the meaning of the prosecution, and Judge Zhang ruled to postpone the hearing to another day.</p>

<p>The previous morning around ten o'clock, Tongren Hospital sent over a man named Xie Chuxian from Shaoxing. Due to some reason, he secretly consumed opium in an attempt to end his life. The Hongkou police station was notified, and detective Zhang Yunxing was dispatched to investigate. It was discovered that Xie was an apprentice at the Xin Ken bookstore at No. 45 Haining Road. Two weeks prior, a fountain pen went missing from the store. The manager, Zhang Muhan, suspected Xie of stealing it and intended to dismiss him. Upon hearing this, Xie felt extreme resentment. He then asked his neighbor, a maid named Xie Lu, to purchase opium for three jiao from Bian Chungui, a Jiangbei resident at No. 766 Ren Zhi Lane on North Sichuan Road, which he swallowed, leading to this incident. The incident was reported to the head of the police, who secretly went to the address with Chinese and foreign officers to arrest Bian. Five small containers of opium, weighing one liang, were confiscated, along with silver coins and copper coins. The person was taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special District Court. Lawyer Wang Yaotang of the Public Works Department detailed the case, stating that the defendant claimed at the police station that the opium was delivered daily by a certain person from the French Concession. However, he only bought it from his associate, as he was indeed the boss. He requested an investigation. Subsequently, detective Zhang presented the confiscated evidence for inspection. Judge Xiao Xiefen questioned the defendant clearly and precisely, sentencing Bian Chungui to one year of imprisonment and a fine of one hundred yuan, with the confiscated items confiscated.</p>

<p>Yesterday around 2:10 AM, a sudden accident occurred in a shantytown inhabited by Li Jinchang from Tongzhou, located across from Changcheng Village on Connaught Road in West Shanghai. Flames erupted instantly, spreading to neighboring residences. After the public's desperate efforts to extinguish the fire, it was finally put out in about half an hour. A total of seven thatched houses were destroyed. Police Chief Qian from the Singapore Road police station went to arrest Li Jinchang, the originator of the fire. Li claimed that the fire was set by Zhuang Longgen, and so Zhuang was also detained and taken to the Caojiadu Public Security Sub-bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>On the 29th of last month, a brawl involving thugs occurred in the area of the Zhabei Sun Temple, as previously reported. It is now learned that after being escorted by the Xinzha Sub-bureau to the Public Security Bureau, the case was sent to the Shanghai District Court the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning around 11 AM, the Prosecutor's Office conducted an investigation, and because Zhang Gongqi, Zhang Yongsheng, and Wang Abin were severely injured, the court ordered each individual to post bail and seek medical treatment, to be reviewed after recovery.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Murderer Tao Yongchang Continues to Cause Trouble in Prison; One Wave Subsides, Another Rises; Demands Transfer and Insults Warden <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Murderer Tao Yongchang, nicknamed Xiao Xizi, along with accomplices Xiao Taizhou and Wang Wangjiao Ahu, shot and killed Cao Adi, a Jiangyin dockyard ruffian, at a small general assembly hall on Minguo Road outside the Xiaodongmen in the French Concession at the end of June 1933. After the incident, Tao immediately went into hiding, and the French police issued an arrest warrant but were unable to apprehend him. In the summer of last year, Tao was passing by Tangshan Road in Hongkou when he was spotted by the wife of the deceased, Cao Adi, who raised the alarm and had him arrested and handed over to the Public Concession police, who transferred him to the French police and the Special District Court for prosecution. The trial concluded with a fifteen-year prison sentence. The convicted criminal refused to accept the ruling and appealed to the Third Branch of the Higher Court, which upheld the original verdict. The criminal still refused to accept the decision and appealed to the Supreme Court for a first instance appeal. During the appeal period, the criminal was held in the detention center of the Special District Court. However, in June of this year, the criminal dared to collude with fellow inmates Wang Deyu and Wang Yuhe, who were also murderers, to extort money from Wang Xinggao, the mastermind behind another murder case, who had been sentenced to life imprisonment and was currently appealing. Wang Xinggao sent a letter to the French Police Department reporting the extortion. The French police took Tao Yongchang, Wang Deyu, Wang Yuhe, and the informant Wang Xinggao into custody for investigation and handed them over to the Special District Court for prosecution. Judge Zhang Chaozuo concluded the investigation, sentencing Tao Yongchang to six months in prison. Wang Deyu and Wang Yuhe were found not guilty. Tao still refused to accept the verdict and is currently appealing to the Third Branch of the Higher Court. The Supreme Court has already announced its judgment on the criminal's murder case, reducing his sentence by one year. Once the judgment and case files are sent to the Third Branch of the Higher Court, he will be transferred to prison to serve his sentence. However, the criminal has been quite restless in the detention center. Last month, he participated with other inmates in a ritual of worshipping Li Guocheng as the "old man," throwing away slop buckets and causing a disturbance by hitting people. After being taken for investigation by the French police, he was sent back and placed in heavy shackles. Unexpectedly, the criminal recently stirred up trouble again. Because of the hot weather recently, Tao was held in the West Wing, where the air was not circulating and was very stuffy. He requested that the warden of the detention center transfer him to the East Wing, which is attached to the Special Prison on Masnan Road, because it was more spacious than the West Wing. The warden refused his request, and Tao harbored resentment but did not express it verbally. Instead, he wrote insulting notes inside the prison, calling the warden and other officials "lackeys." The detention center discovered the notes and reported them to the warden, who questioned Tao. Tao not only refused to submit but also used abusive language and was defiant. The warden ordered Tao to be transferred to the French police for investigation and prosecution. The day before yesterday, the police sent Tao to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special District Court, where Judge Zhang Chaozuo questioned him. A lawyer from the Police Department, Chen, explained the case and prosecuted him for insulting public officials. Judge Zhang was furious at the offender's audacity in acting lawlessly within a place of law and stated that he deserved no mercy. According to Tao's confession, the notes were written by a Mr. Zhang, a former opium addict who had just been released from prison. He claimed that he had been well-behaved in prison before, but he was now demanding improved treatment because the current conditions in prison were too harsh. The court reviewed the confession and ordered further investigation and interrogation. The defendant was remanded to custody.</p>

<p>Yang Xunshi, a woman from Baoying, Jiangbei, is sixty-three years old. She originally farmed for a living in her hometown and had two sons. Because her husband's older brother, Yang Shunkang, had no children, she gave him her eldest son as an heir. In 1930, Yang had disagreements with Shunkang, and over time, their animosity deepened. She then plotted to harm him but had no opportunity. On June 8th of that year, while Shunkang was working in the fields, Yang led several people, grabbed Shunkang, beat him severely, and pushed him into the river, where he drowned. His family managed to retrieve his body and place it in a coffin. Yang fled without a trace. Subsequently, her clan reported the incident to the county, and an autopsy confirmed that he had been murdered. An arrest warrant was issued for Yang. Ding Ziwen, the local bailiff of the county, came to Shanghai with Xun Guizhen, a member of the clan, and discovered that Yang Goushi was hiding in a straw shed at the lime kiln in Xiaoshadu, West Shanghai. The day before yesterday afternoon, they went to the Caojiadu Public Security Sub-bureau, which dispatched police to the address and arrested Yang, taking her back to the bureau. After an interrogation by Officer Liu, she was transferred to the main bureau for further investigation due to the case involving the murder of her husband's brother.</p>

On the morning of the 30th of last month, around 6 AM, she was going to school. Because the lesson time had not arrived, she went to a classmate's home on Fuxu Road to the south. As she was about to reach the sidewalk, she was suddenly struck by a self-owned car No. 6474, driven by Qiu Feihai, which was traveling west. It is unknown how, but he mistakenly drove south, knocking Cuizhen down and seriously injuring her. He did not rush her to the hospital for treatment. By the time the police medical car arrived and transported Cuizhen to the hospital for treatment, she had lost too much blood and died without receiving adequate medical care. The prosecutor dispatched by the First Special District Court conducted an autopsy, confirming that she had died from the injuries sustained in the collision. Huang Hanting has retained lawyers Fan Gang and Huang Xuanzhang to file a criminal lawsuit to seek legal protection.</p>

<p>Kong Xiangxi Gives Four Instructions</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st) At the opening ceremony of Children's Year in the capital, Kong Xiangxi delivered a speech, the gist of which is as follows: "The meaning and purpose of Children's Year is to cultivate healthy citizens and save the country from its precarious situation. However, the foundation of the nation is children, so education is the most important thing for children, and training is the second. Whether children are of school age or not, they should be effectively educated by schools or families, and children should be trained with the inherent virtues of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace of our nation. I would like to put forward a few points that should be noted in all aspects of Children's Year for reference: (1) The Party and government should formulate laws and regulations to protect children, support appropriate child welfare organizations, and prohibit the abuse of children in society; (2) Society should be enthusiastic about child welfare undertakings and organize activities that are beneficial to children as much as possible; (3) Families should fully understand how to strengthen children's physique and increase their knowledge, so as to fulfill their parents' responsibility of education; (4) Children should know how to endure hardship, be self-reliant, and strive to be good citizens. In the family, they should start by being filial and fraternal, and only in this way can they shoulder great responsibilities for the country in the future. The above four points are just an outline. I hope everyone can implement them practically, so that the foundation of the country can be consolidated, the nation can be revived, and we will not fail the meaning of today's meeting."</p>

<p>— Originally written by Ms. Alcott of the United States, translated by Zheng Xiaocang (Zonghai)</p>
<p>The house seemed to be filled with children, who were spending the misty, drizzly evening in various forms of entertainment. Clearly, the children filled every corner—"upstairs, downstairs, and in the landlady's room"—because through several open doors one could see happy groups of big children, little children, and children of all sizes, all engaged in various pastimes. Although the styles differed, the result was very noisy. Two large rooms on the right were clearly classrooms, because here only desks, maps, blackboards, and scattered books were visible. A roaring fire burned in the stove, and several lazy boys were reclining near the stove by the wall, discussing a new ball game, so excited that only their boots could be seen flailing in the air. A tall youth was practicing playing the flute at his leisure, undisturbed by the noise around him. Two or three others were straddling desks, pausing occasionally to catch their breath, and one small comedian was making humorous cartoons of all their companions, eliciting much laughter and joy.</p>
<p>In a room on the left, a long dining table was set up, with several large bottles of fresh milk, piles of yellow and white bread, and dazzling gingerbread neatly stacked on top. How precious these were in the hearts of the children! Suddenly, the aroma of baked bread wafted through the air, mixed with the scent of baked apples. How could these not tempt a hungry little tummy and little nose?</p>
<p>However, the scene that impressed him the most was in the small opening inside the door, that is, in the stairwell. At the very top, a lively tug-of-war was in progress. The top platform of one section was being used for a game of jacks, another for a chessboard, and on each of the steps, a boy was reading a book, a girl was singing a lullaby to her doll, two puppies, a kitten, and a string of little boys were sliding down the handrail, regardless of the fact that this was very detrimental to their clothes and could easily endanger their limbs.</p>

<p>Ceremony Held</p>
<p>The opening ceremony was held at 9:00 AM. The presidium consisted of Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Xingya, Director of the Education Bureau Pan Gongzhan (represented by Jiang Jianbai), Director of the Health Bureau Li Ting'an, Director of the Public Security Bureau Cai Jinjun (represented by Su Liping), and Cai Hongtian from the Municipal Party Headquarters. Wang Guangqing served as the master of ceremonies. The ceremony was performed as usual. First, Mayor Wu delivered an opening speech, followed by a speech by Cai Hongtian, the representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters. Child representatives Chen Zhuting from Xicheng, Chen Zhitong from Commercial Press, and Shen Jichuan from the Health Camp then gave responses. The Children's Year song was sung before the event concluded.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech</p>
<p>Mayor Wu said in his opening speech: "Members of the presidium, ladies and gentlemen, children, today is the opening of the nationally designated Children's Year. It is a great honor for the citizens of Shanghai to celebrate the opening of Children's Year here, because Children's Year was proposed by the city of Shanghai and approved by the National Government. From today until July 31st next year, administrative agencies and public organizations across the country will strive to promote and implement children's affairs during this year. Children are the seeds of the Chinese nation, and they are the continuation of the life of the Chinese nation. The rise and fall of the future of the Chinese nation depends entirely on whether today's Chinese children have hope. Whether today's children have hope depends on the responsibility of today's parents, today's society, and the government. The government, society, and parents must bear the responsibility of educating children. Therefore, the National Government has designated this year as Children's Year to instill the concept of caring for children in the people of the whole country, and at the same time to make children aware of the importance of their own position. China has too shallow a concept of the nation, and too deep a concept of the family. If we can transfer the concept of planning for the family to planning for the nation, I believe the Chinese nation would not have today's situation. Even if we have today's situation, we can break through this difficulty. Unfortunately, the people of the whole country still only plan for their families and clans, and not for the entire nation. Therefore, although there are 450 million people, accounting for a quarter of the world's population, they are still oppressed, bullied, and dominated by a small number of ethnic groups. The reason for this is that the 450 million people are like a plate of loose sand, with no unity, only planning for individuals and families, and not for the entire nation. This is the first reason. The first reason is that we only know how to pass on the seeds, but we don't know how to cultivate the seeds. What is the use of having many people if they are not educated? Instead, they are oppressed, bullied, and dominated by ethnic groups with fewer people but more education. Because we only know how to pass on the seeds and don't know how to cultivate them, so more people cannot generate more strength. Han Feizi said, 'Millions of ignorant people are called no people.' This is the principle. The ancient saying goes, 'There are three unfilial acts, and having no descendants is the greatest.' If we only pass on descendants for a family, but do not educate them, they will become prodigal sons. If we pass on descendants for a nation, but they have no knowledge, they will become a nation-destroying seed. Therefore, from now on, the government, society, and parents must bear the responsibility of educating children, so that they can not only prosper a family, but also revive the nation. Otherwise, not taking responsibility for education will result in prodigal sons and nation-destroying seeds. Therefore, during this nationally designated Children's Year, we must not only strive to promote and implement children's affairs, but also awaken the attention of the people of the whole country to have a new concept of children, and awaken the attention of children across the country to recognize that today's children are the future masters of China, and they are the ones who will continue the life of the Chinese nation. We must value our position ourselves. Therefore, it is meaningful for representatives of children from all over the city to celebrate the opening of Children's Year here today. The Municipal Government will strive to promote children's affairs within its capabilities, especially children's affairs for the poor. The Municipal Government has planned to build 3,000 houses for the poor. In the new villages for the poor, there will be simple clinics, elementary schools, children's parks, and children's nurseries, so that poor children can receive appropriate education. However, children's affairs are great, and cannot be done by the government alone. I hope people from all walks of life will work together to promote them."</p>
<p>Cai's Speech</p>
<p>Cai Hongtian, the representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, said in his speech, "Today is the first day of the nationally designated Children's Year. Children are the foundation of the nation, and we must pay special attention to the education and protection of children. Therefore, the government has designated 24 years as the nationally designated Children's Year. Today's opening ceremony is to start promoting children's affairs from today. Children are the future masters of the country. We must cultivate children with the spirit of craftsmen, so that they can protect the country in the future, just like craftsmen protect houses and gardens. But to cultivate their spirit of craftsmen, they must forge a healthy physique and instill rich knowledge."</p>
<p>Children's Responses</p>
<p>(1) Chen Zhuting from Xicheng Elementary School said, "Children, today is the opening day of Children's Year, and it is the most memorable day. The mayor and officials from various agencies have spent a lot of effort and financial resources to make today's ceremony possible. How should we be grateful? We children are the center of human society, and we must love society, the country, and even humanity, and take responsibility for serving society and the country. I hope for the care of people in society, and I hope we will work hard ourselves." (2) Chen Zhitong, a child laborer from the Commercial Press, said, "Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honor to be here today to contribute my opinions as a child representative. The government's designation of Children's Year and the holding of today's grand ceremony are of great significance. It is entirely to improve our environment and raise our living standards. Today's children will be tomorrow's adults. Disregarding today's children is disregarding tomorrow's adults. If a country wants to be strong, it must have strong children to produce strong adults to take on major responsibilities. Today, we children thank the government for its attention, and at the same time, we must study hard, exercise our bodies, use domestic products, and implement the New Life Movement." (3) Shen Jichuan from the Children's Summer Health Camp said, "Ladies and gentlemen, students, in the current era, no one can deny that today's children are the future masters of the country, but we must study hard and exercise our bodies, so that we can shoulder the responsibility of being masters in the future. I hope everyone will work hard, the strength or weakness of the country in the future depends entirely on us."</p>

<h3 id="e154">The Dispute Over Co-educational Schools in Private Middle Schools in Beiping Has Not Ended <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Representatives of the Private Middle School Federation Firmly Demand the Original Telegram of Instructions from the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping) The issue of co-educational schools in Beiping is getting bigger and bigger. The Municipal Government insists on not allowing co-education and ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to strictly ban co-educational schools in all private middle schools. The Private Middle School Federation submitted a petition to the Ministry of Education, requesting the Ministry to stop the Beiping authorities from banning co-educational schools, so as not to conflict with the middle school regulations. The Private Middle School Federation held a secret meeting in Zhongshan Park today to discuss further measures, but before the facts are successful, the deliberation resolutions must be kept absolutely confidential. The attitude of the Ministry of Education is particularly noteworthy. At present, Qiuzhongfang hopes that the Ministry of Education will give some instructions so as to resolve the dispute as soon as possible. The Municipal Government has always insisted on the "banning of co-educational schools", so it is not easy to resolve the dispute for a while. The situation of all parties is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attitude of the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>One week after the Beiping co-educational school dispute occurred, the Ministry of Education sent a telegram to the Beiping Education Authorities, giving some instructions. The Social Affairs Bureau did not publicize the original telegram due to certain reasons, and only stated that the Ministry of Education had approved the issue of gender-separated schools in principle. Representatives of private middle schools said that the Ministry of Education did not approve the Beiping authorities' proposal. The Private Middle School Federation had previously telegraphed the Ministry of Education, requesting that the original plan for co-educational schools be maintained. The Ministry of Education has now issued an approval to Beiping. The original text is as follows: "I have received the report. I have given detailed instructions on the plan submitted to the Ministry by the Social Affairs Bureau. Please wait for the Bureau to comply." Regarding the two points of the original telegram of the Ministry of Education, "detailed instructions" and "wait for the Bureau to comply", the Private Middle School Federation expressed doubts, so it is necessary to read the original telegram of the Ministry of Education to the Social Affairs Bureau. However, as of press time, the Social Affairs Bureau has not allowed access to the telegram, and the truth is still unknown.</p>
<p>Private Middle School Representatives Speak</p>
<p>According to representatives of private middle schools, the Beiping Social Affairs Bureau, based on the instructions of the Municipal Government, banned co-educational schools and founded the Second Municipal Girls' Middle School, enrolling students in the second grade and above, which is an illegal act. Article 23 of the Ministry of Education's Middle School Regulations states that "newly established middle schools shall not enroll students in the third grade or above in the first year, and shall not enroll students in the third grade or above in the second year." Therefore, the newly established Beiping Municipal Second Girls' Middle School violated the Ministry of Education's Middle School Regulations by enrolling female students from the second and third grades of various private middle schools in the first year. Co-educational schools are consistent across the country, why is Beiping unique? Private middle schools in Beiping have vocational commercial or normal courses, but the Municipal Girls' Middle School does not have such courses, only ordinary classes. Now the Beiping authorities are forcing female students from private middle schools to transfer to the Municipal Girls' Middle School. How can they be accommodated? In short, even if the Social Affairs Bureau violates the intentions of the Ministry of Education, private middle schools will still enroll female students and maintain Beiping's inherent educational achievements before the Ministry of Education has expressly abolished the middle school regulations.</p>
<p>Circular from the Social Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>It has been found that this city has strictly implemented gender-separated schools in middle schools and has ordered all private boys' middle schools (note: the authorities call them boys' middle schools, but private middle schools only call themselves a certain private middle school, such as Northern Middle School, North China Middle School, Wenzhi Middle School, etc., and no school is specifically called a boys' middle school) not to enroll female students, and ordered all co-educational private middle schools to report the female students in the second and third grades, and the female students of each school may apply to this bureau for registration, so as to find ways to accommodate them. Now it is found that some schools still publish advertisements for enrollment that also accept female students. I am afraid that female students who should go to school do not understand the truth and still go to apply. This is a further announcement that the student status of female students who are admitted to various private boys' middle schools will not be approved by this bureau. In addition to strictly ordering each private middle school to stop this practice, it is appropriate to announce it to the public, and each should pay attention to it and apply to the Municipal Private Girls' Middle School to avoid harming themselves.

After drafting the methods, it was designated that the Municipal Nongtan, Caotang, Tanzhen, Caonan, Jingcun, and Yucai six schools be the places where training classes for private school teachers are held in different districts. It is now scheduled to be held from August 10th to August 20th as the registration date, and from September 1st to December 30th as the training date.

<p>The Japanese Ritsumeikan University table tennis team competed with the Shanghai powerhouse Post and Telecommunications Workers Team at the Central Auditorium last night. The battle was lively and wonderful. Therefore, even in the hot summer, the audience was still extremely crowded (details of the victory or defeat will be revealed in this newspaper tomorrow). Tonight is one of the last battles of the Ritsumeikan team in Shanghai. The opponent is the Shanghai United Team. It is known that the Shanghai United Team is organized by the elites of various teams in Shanghai. Its strength is strong. It is expected that it will defeat Ritsumeikan. However, all team members still hope not to be arrogant or complacent in order to be able to win. The Japanese are brave and resolute, and the spirit of the competition is admirable. The list of Shanghai United team members is recorded below (Shanghai United Team) Lu Zhongqiu, Zhu Kui Sheng, Chen Zhensheng, Lu Hanjun, Rong Deneng, Zhu Wenlin, Zou Guofan, Deng Guofu (one person is still undecided)</p>

<h3 id="e164">Summer at Xuanwu Lake <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Su Qin</p>
<p>In the summer, going to Xuanwu Lake will make people mistakenly believe that it is early autumn. Everywhere is a lush green, everywhere is a dense layer of shade, the scenery is always so quiet, and the ends of the four houses are silent without any sound.</p>
<p>But, do you say it is too depressed and too deserted? But it is not. Look, on the lake over there, aren't there many children and women rowing boats? On the tea seats over there, aren't there dozens or hundreds of people? However, you can't hear any noise.</p>
<p>Relying on the city root of Fengrun Gate, there is full of clear lake water. Unknown aquatic plants, when you paddle past, are sandwiched between newly born lotus leaves and newly blooming lotus flowers, floating on the water, shaking slightly. You must appreciate that kind of rough-line charm.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you pick a sunny afternoon, if you are not afraid of the sun, run to the upper floor of Jiming Temple, or simply walk to Taicheng, and you will have a leisurely look at Xuanwu Lake. You see that distant Jiangshan Mountain, the undulating ridges and peaks, a purple-golden peak shadow, as if it is rushing straight into the heart of the lake. Go and imagine that kind of majestic and beautiful scenery.</p>
<p>At that time, that heroic and unrestrained mood is unique to you, even though the sun makes you sweat all over. This look can be done in spring or autumn, but in spring, the reflections in the lake do not have heavy colors, and in autumn, the lake is too desolate. Only in summer, there is such fun.</p>
<p>As for the lake scenery under the moonlit night, I don't want to talk about it. If you have the experience of "lake tour on a moonlit night", you can always know something. Let's just say, it has a different interest compared to the night market in Confucius Temple and on the Qinhuai River. It might be better under the starlight. Because the night scene is hazy, the shallow lake around it will make you feel like it is a vast ocean, and the future is so dark and dark, all of it.</p>

<p>— Yan Yun</p>
<p>Modern science is prosperous, and the precision of machines is not only ingenious, but also can promote human marriage. As I have heard, it is a good story. A certain female student of a certain university in the ancient capital, born with beauty, has a famous reputation for a while. The pursuers of the opposite sex are all from Gansu Province, and they respect her as the Queen of the Frontier. Gu Hou's seat is abundant and her nature is high and arrogant, despising the masses and seldom allowing it. One day, she received an electric report saying that her mother was seriously ill and urged her to return immediately. The woman thought that she was separated by thousands of miles and it was difficult to fly. So she sought a plan from the China Travel Service. The people in the company told her that Eurasia Airlines had a scheduled flight taking off the next morning and could reach Lanzhou the next day. The woman was overjoyed upon hearing the news and immediately bought a ticket and returned to school to pack her luggage. There was a student named Ling who was also one of the pursuers of the lady on weekdays. At that time, he learned about the matter and bought a ticket to go there before the woman the next day. When the woman boarded, she saw Ling sitting side by side and asked in surprise where she was going. Ling smiled and said: Knowing that you are forced by filial piety, flying alone for thousands of miles, I specially came to be a follower. The woman initially thought it was a joke, but when she saw that his words were sincere and the ticket he was holding pointed to the same place as her own, she suddenly felt that there was a companion on the journey and was quite interested. When the plane took off, Ling diligently protected her and was meticulous in every way. Then the plane suddenly rose and fell, almost suspecting that she was in the midst of stormy waves. The woman was inevitably dizzy because it was her first flight. Ling became more protective and careful, and pointed out the sights and scenes along the way to encourage her. The woman gradually felt at ease and had more fun. That night, she stayed at the Xi'an Northwest Hotel. The woman missed her mother's illness and turned over all night. When the night was about to end, she still saw a figure wandering outside the window and recognized it as Ling. She called out and asked why she didn't sleep. Ling Yun: The inn is lonely and quiet. I am afraid that you are afraid of insomnia, so I specially patrol remotely. The woman couldn't bear it very much and urged her to go to bed frequently. Ling responded slowly. The next day, Ling's eyes were all red because he hadn't slept all night. After arriving in Lanzhou, the woman went home with Ling. Her mother's illness had improved slightly. In addition to being happy, she deeply felt Ling's thousands of miles of following and became more cordial. After returning to school, she made a marriage contract with him. Recently, the reporter went to Ping for some business and happened to attend their wedding banquet. The guests were shocked by the bride's beauty and asked to announce the history of their marriage. Ling Sheng then happily recounted the process as described above. The woman's surname is Huo, and her father is an industrialist, a descendant of General Huo Qubing of the Han Dynasty.

<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Because that Governor of the Province, after receiving the imperial decree, was sent to Heilongjiang as a soldier, he soon died there; although his family was still safely left in his hometown, his property had been confiscated by the Empress Dowager, and at most only the daily needs of the family could be maintained. In addition, everyone knew that they were the family members of criminals and could not help but despise them. Not only could they not get rich again, but they would lose face everywhere.</p>
<p>I remember two or three years ago, which was more than 20 years after the demise of the Manchu Qing Dynasty. I was in Shanghai. One day, I accidentally walked into a silk company and selected several pieces of clothing material. Since it was inconvenient to carry them back myself, I wrote down my name and address and asked them to send someone to deliver them to me. In the evening, they sent a very low-level clerk to deliver the things. But this person was very strange. After I received the things, he didn't just go out. He blushed and asked me:</p>
<p>"Has the madam lived in the palace before?"</p>
<p>This question was of course very surprising to me, but I really didn't need to hide it, so I immediately nodded in agreement. Then he continued to tell me that he himself was also a son of an official family and had been a family friend with my family, but for more than 20 years, he had been in a very difficult situation, and everyone around him was mocking him, making it impossible for them to have a future, so he himself was reduced to being a clerk in a silk shop because he had no other choice.</p>
<p>When I heard him say his surname, I suddenly understood. It turned out that he was the youngest son of the evil governor who was sent to Heilongjiang by the Empress Dowager; I didn't expect that more than 20 years had passed, and the just punishment that the Empress Dowager gave to the rebel minister had not failed, and it was still like it had just happened yesterday!

<h3 id="e168">The World's Attention on Quintuplets <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Special</p>
<p>In Ontario, Canada, the wife of a resident named Dionne gave birth to quintuplets last year. During labor, the process was naturally very difficult. Fortunately, the renowned Dr. Dafoe's surgery was highly skilled, and all five babies were safely delivered. The mother also remained safe and sound. Babies born as quintuplets are naturally weaker than ordinary infants, so it was extremely difficult to raise them in the first few months. However, with special care from doctors, each of them grew up to be adorable. They are now over a year old. Originally, the Ontario government, considering quintuplets a rare occurrence in the world and fearing inadequate care from their parents, which would jeopardize their safety, obtained the consent of the parents immediately after the babies were born and placed them under state care. A highly sanitary nursery was built not far from the parents' residence, and Mrs. Kirilenko, a dedicated caregiver, along with several assistants, was hired to provide specialized care. Two capable policemen were also assigned to guard them day and night to prevent any unexpected harm.</p>
<p>The Dionne couple's family was originally poor. Recently, some people have been trying to persuade them to take back the quintuplets from the authorities to make money. Eighty percent of the profits would go to the Dionne couple, with the manager taking the remaining ten percent. They even said to the Dionne couple: "If you had a gold mine, would the government be able to seize it? Naturally, they would allow you to mine it as you please. Then, how can the government have the right to take away your five children?" Mr. Croll, the Minister of Public Welfare in Ontario, and his colleagues disagreed with this. Mr. Croll said, "These five children cannot be compared to a gold mine. This is an unprecedented event in scientific history. Canada regards it as a national treasure, and the government has a sacred duty to protect these five little treasures who are related to the world, and to prevent them from being exploited and endangering their safety. Under no circumstances can we allow them to leave their current sanitary residence and be displayed as oddities for people to see."</p>
<p>Since the quintuplets were born, they caused a sensation across the country. Furthermore, the quintuplets were born lively and adorable, so people from all walks of life hoped to see them and feast their eyes. Initially, after consultation with the guardians, it was agreed that people could watch them through the glass window from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM every Sunday afternoon. After this news spread, everyone rushed to be first, and each time, there were always four or five hundred people coming to see them. However, viewing is no longer permitted now because these nine children can now understand things. They see many strangers crowding outside the window, looking and talking noisily, and they also open their small eyes wide, staring outward. As a result, they experience neurological reactions at night when they sleep, making them quite restless. Therefore, Dr. Dafoe ordered that people should not be allowed to watch them even on Sundays. At the same time, anything that could harm the well-being of the quintuplets is strictly prohibited. However, the quintuplets' parents can still visit them freely. Their mother can play with the quintuplets and help with bathing and dressing them. Currently, the quintuplets' bodies are very healthy, but according to Dr. Dafoe's opinion, the quintuplets were all born prematurely, so in the coming months, they still need special care to ensure everything goes smoothly.</p>
<p>These five children can now babble and crawl on the ground. They spend their days together, playing with each other, and seeing their comical state makes people stand for hours without getting bored. Their faces are similar, making it easy to mistake them. They wake up in bed at five o'clock every morning, singing and playing with their small hands, and making sounds from their throats, as if urging the caregivers to change their clothes. They bathe once in the morning and evening, playing and splashing in the water. After eating, they change their clothes and are placed in a stroller in the hallway by the caregivers, allowing them to play or sleep. They eat again at noon, and by seven o'clock in the evening, they all fall asleep. According to the current caregiver, Mrs. Kirilenko, these five children are very humorous. If you give them something they don't like to eat, they will pretend to be sick. They often look at you out of the corner of their eyes to see if you are paying attention to them. If you go to hug them, they will laugh heartily and throw themselves into your arms, which is truly lovely!</p>
<p>These five children are fortunate to have Dr. Dafoe, whose surgery skills are superb, deliver them, and a government that values the well-being of children to carefully care for them. Otherwise, we often hear of single births, but the babies always die soon after birth, or die within a few days. To raise quintuplets to be healthy in every way is undoubtedly a miracle in the world.</p>

<p>While drinking tea, he twitched his eyebrows twice, then put down his teacup and smiled, saying, "In Mr. Cheng’s opinion, how is this matter?" Zhichian said, "I have a joke that can be used as an analogy. I heard that the ghost of someone who died unjustly must find a replacement..." Before Huanhua could finish speaking, she blushed and smiled, "Yes, in order to make his match successful, Mr. Jia helped me with train fare so that I could return to Jiangnan, as if catching this Miss Zhu as a replacement. In fact, this Miss Cai has no choice but to marry. Even if I didn't act as a matchmaker, she would still marry someone. Moreover, what was I doing in Xi'an? She now has a master and doesn't have to worry about food or clothing, which is very different from my situation." Zhichian looked at him for a long time without saying a word. He felt that on her skin, which usually didn't wear makeup, a flush was showing. He thought of Yueying's face, which, in its healthy color, revealed a hint of pallor. That's how things are in the world, always opposing and complementing each other. Huanhua, seeing him staring like that, felt a little embarrassed and forced herself to calm down, saying, "I know Mr. Cheng likes that girl very much, but when we came out to be matchmakers, you never said you wanted her." Zhichian waved his hands repeatedly and laughed, "Far from it, far from it! Let's drop this matter and not talk about it anymore." Huanhua took two more sips of tea, staring into the teacup, and then said, "I can't count myself as gone yet. There is a car going to Tongguan tomorrow, and Mr. Jia has arranged for someone to take me. He gave me a dozen or so dollars, which is only enough to buy a third-class train ticket, and maybe not even enough. Even if I don't eat or drink on the way, if anything small happens, I won't have any spare money to take out. How can I dare to leave boldly?" (279)</p>

<h3 id="e170">Finance: Foreign Banks Unchanged, Bullion Rebounds High <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>—Good Start at $5.80—</p>
<p>After the sharp decline in the gold market the previous morning, the foreign banks in yesterday's market remained inconsistent. In addition, there were rumors of a certain bank purchasing strips in the after-hours market, causing sentiment to rebound, rising to above $90. After the opening, sentiment eased as the central bank sold foreign exchange, leading to a slight decline. However, the Hong Kong market was flat, and after the initial drop, there was a considerable rebound. The trend was erratic. According to yesterday's foreign dispatches, London's large strips were nearly flat in the long term, but the local market indicated that the market was stable in the near term but sluggish in the long term. American silver was flat, and forward silver prices in Montreal showed little change. Exchange rates slightly contracted. London's raw gold rose by three pence, and sentiment turned bullish again. Pre-market informal trading opened and immediately rose to $87.80, then rose again to above the $90 mark before large players supplied the market, causing it to fluctuate. After the opening, the central bank's postings were revealed, with both British and American exchange rates flat, and the customs gold unit rose by 1.1 fen. The standard bullion price only rose to $908.80 (?), which boosted sentiment and led to repeated rises above the $90 mark. However, because the standard price was inconsistent with the customs gold price, some doubts arose, causing sentiment to become chaotic, with frequent ups and downs, which was extremely erratic. Later, the Central Bank and HSBC successively released spot pounds sterling, causing the market to turn downward. However, because banks were still absorbing the cheaper currency, and the HSBC exchange rate postings were flat for both British and American currencies, there were frequent struggles during the process. Ultimately, the exchange rate market hardened, Shanghai sold off, and the market ended lower. HSBC took advantage of the low prices to cover its positions. Reports from the Hong Kong market were normal, and buyers quickly became active, gradually improving the market, but it did not break through the $90 mark. Chinese merchants continued to sell foreign exchange, and the domestic market eased again.</p>
<p>There was still latent selling pressure. Banks took advantage of the low prices to maintain the market. Predictions for Indian silver suggested a decrease of one anna, but the market was still able to rally, briefly breaking through the $90 mark.</p>
<p>But soon it weakened again. At noon, the trend was wavering. The market in the afternoon was peaceful, and the fluctuation stabilized. Later, the Chinese Merchants Bank again sold foreign exchange, causing sentiment to turn downward for a time and slightly decline, but the selling was only temporary. Buyers were active at the lower prices, and the exchange rate market turned flat. Soon, it rallied again. Reports from Indian silver indicated a decrease of three annas, causing a slight increase in the market. The market situation was mediocre. Finally, Indian silver rose by one anna, but because sentiment was stable, the market remained firm. The day's market situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening was at $889, a rise of $7 compared to the previous closing. The central bank's postings initially reported that the customs gold price had risen by 0.3 li. Yongli, Hengyu, Dafa, Yonglai, and Jin rose to $92. Dadecheng, Dalianbang, Jiarun, Yuanyi, and Yingxiang took advantage of the high prices to sell off, causing the price to fall to $88. Huixiang, Hengyu, and Yongli still rose to $9.2. Fuxing, Yongyuansheng, Yongtiancheng, and Xiang sold off, causing the price to fall to $8. Before long, the central bank's customs gold postings rose by 1.1 fen, and Dafa, Yonghengyu, and Yongli again rose to $91.5. However, because the exchange rate market was not tight, the standard bullion price rose only slightly, which confused the industry. Tianchengxiang, Dadecheng, Wanfeng, Hengyu, and Yingxiang all sold, retreating to $87. Chunyuan, Yonghongxing, Fuxing, and Yonghengyu continued to maintain the market, rising to $90. The central bank and HSBC released spot pounds sterling, prompting Chunyuan, Yongwanfeng, Yuanyi, Wanxing, Fuxing, and Yongyifeng to sell off their strips, falling to $85. Anticipating that the HSBC postings would be flat for both British and American currencies, Hengyu, Yingxiang, Dada, Fuxing, and Yongjin rose to $7.5.

However, because the standard bullion price and the customs gold closing price were not consistent, the sentiment of Chinese merchants was confused and unsettled. Shanghai sometimes had a market but no transactions, and the situation fluctuated. Later, the Central Bank and HSBC successively released spot pounds sterling, and sentiment was tired, and the process turned hard.

<p>Previous Prices Are Still Good at About 1 Jiao, Gold Short-Term and Long-Term Fall Suddenly Rose</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market of the Chinese Stock Exchange was gradually dominated by short sellers. Since the emergence of the No. 48 bull, people's hearts have been scattered. The previous rumors have become a bubble, and it has been heard that a certain bull is also about to emerge, and the pulling power has been exhausted. The future will not decline in a straight line, and it will also fluctuate for a while. The so-called borrowing is just a rumor, and expansion is also a nervous reaction. A very large rift has suddenly emerged in the financial circles of Ningbo, and the public bond market has been closely hit. The temporary trend is mostly dominated by small faces. Only the 96 public bond has broken the 10 yuan level after the sale of No. 4 in the previous two days, but No. 4 is making up for the low, and it does not seem to be reduced urgently.

<p>New York Stock Market Rises Again</p>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported yesterday (31st) that the New York stock market rose again, and the transaction was as smooth as it had not been since May 28th. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose to its highest point since 1931, and the Public Utility Index also created a new record in 1935. Individually, most utility stocks have risen to new highs this year. Galelli's production has surged, and it has been heard that legislation unfavorable to public utilities is unlikely to be implemented. The bond market is slightly higher, and the small exchange market has also risen. The total number of shares traded throughout the day was 1.91 million shares.

<p>The Origin of the Saying About Opening Auctions for Foreign Wheat</p>
<p>Foreign Wheat Could Originally Be Received and Released, But Japanese Merchants Will Now Conduct Open Transactions</p>
<p>The claim that the Grain Exchange is opening auctions for foreign wheat is not factual. According to the Exchange's long-standing practice, foreign wheat has always been handled for delivery according to standard procedures. The grades of wheat from places like Canada and Australia are also reviewed and determined annually. Therefore, there is no need to establish separate standards. In reality, it's a return to the old practice, where foreign wheat transported by Japanese ships and stored in Japanese warehouses can be received and released as usual without rejection. This means the secret of Japanese merchants hawking foreign wheat is now out in the open.</p>
<p>Chips Will Increase, the Flour and Wheat Market Is Quite Volatile</p>
<p>The flour market has turned weak. Foreign wheat quotations fluctuate up and down within two days, but are still up by about 35 cents overall. Market sentiment is quite uneasy. Initially, rumors of inflation were considered unlikely to materialize. Then, it was thought that transportation costs for foreign wheat shipped by Eastern vessels might be lower. As a result, market sentiment has loosened, and opening prices have fallen by 1.01 cents compared to the closing price at the end of last month. For January deliveries, the market has shown an inverted pattern, because inland factories in the Yangtze River region start to join the standard, expanding the chips. However, speaking practically, this view may not hold true. Subsequent trading in all contracts remains active, with most bulls frequently unloading their positions and sometimes going short, causing market sentiment to waver. Foreign wheat bids have reached around $5.00 due to exchange rate issues, so the outlook seems cautiously optimistic. As a result, this month's price fell by 1.25 cents, September's fell by 2 cents, October's fell by 1 cent, November/December's fell by 1.25 cents, and January's opening price was 45 cents with a closing price of 6 cents, showing a gain of 1 cent.</p>
<p>The wheat market has seen a sharp drop in opening prices for all months. Although foreign wheat quotations have shown improvement, market sentiment is downbeat due to the unconfirmed inflation rumors and the talk of opening auctions for foreign wheat. Therefore, after the opening prices, market sentiment for all months has been weak, especially for the current month, as customers with inventory frequently hedged, leading to unstable positions. For distant months, prices are relatively favorable due to contracts with Eastern merchants for foreign wheat, causing a somewhat subdued sentiment. However, this is currently just speculation and may not reflect reality. As a result, this month's price fell by 8 cents from the end of last month, September/October's fell by 6 cents, and November's fell by 5 cents.</p>
<p>The Spot Wheat Market: High-quality wheat is unaffected by the standard, only intermediate wheat is slightly softer. Shandong Yaowan wheat opened at $3.64, Gaoyou wheat at $3.59, Jiangyan wheat at $3.57, and Danyang wheat at $3.53. Xinda shipped out 4,500 bags, and Fufeng shipped out 2,000 bags.</p>
<p>Local and Foreign Rice Sales Are Brisk, Prices Are Up</p>
<p>Local rice (from South Shanghai) saw limited arrivals from brokers yesterday, with only ten-odd firms (totaling over 2,000 piculs). This led to increased bullishness. Sales on the local street were quite brisk, creating a tight situation and a positive market sentiment. Prices for various grades of thick粳 (jīng) rice rose by 10-20 cents, and there was continued demand for various grades of thin秈 (xiān) rice. Brokers from Qingdao, Yantai, and Qinhuangdao purchased over 400 bags, with sluggish retail sales. Prices increased by 10 cents to over 10 cents. Dongxin (東新) led with 2-尺 (chǐ) rice, and芦尖 (lú jiān) rice remained fresh. The market on the north side of the river was unaffected by陰變元 (yīn biàn yuán).</p>
<p>Local rice saw 11-12 firms arriving from various routes. There were 40-50 boats docked at 河下 (Héxià). Sales of various types of white粳 (jīng) rice were brisk due to low inventory in stores. Retail sales were quite active, and prices suddenly jumped by 30-40 cents. Arrivals of early稻 (dào) rice were low but sales were active, and prices followed suit with a 20-30 cent increase. After early薄稻 (báo dào) rice sold out, the market tightened. There was little inventory of 白元河 (bái yuán hé) rice, and retail sales were average. However, buyers were quite firm, causing prices to increase by 20-30 cents. Other types of rice also showed tightening. Dongxin粳 (jīng) rice has been strong for several days, with approximately 500 piculs sold, and retail sales were active, with prices rising by 20 cents.</p>
<p>The foreign rice market was quite lively yesterday. As it was learned that the city's foreign rice inventory was dwindling and orders had all been fulfilled, and with gold prices high and legal goods unprofitable, both sellers and hoarders were setting high bids. Market sentiment was upward. Yesterday, buyers were very eager, with Jiujiang actively buying first, followed by Nanjing, and local streets and hoarders were even more active. Morning prices immediately jumped by 15 cents. In the afternoon, local buyers continued to be active, with inquiries coming not only from the three aforementioned areas but also from inland and northern regions. Rice prices continued to jump by another 10 cents, resulting in a significant increase of 20-30 cents compared to the previous day. Transaction volumes were also higher than usual, with 17,500 bags of Saigon rice, 7,000 bags of Xiaojiao (小絞) rice, and 5,000 bags of Sujing, Dimindang, and Siamese rice. The total volume was close to 30,000 bags, and sentiment remained optimistic. If local buying continues to be strong, prices may gradually increase.</p>
<p>Scarce Arrival of New Jiangxi Soybeans Causes Market to Rise</p>
<p>Since the arrival of new Jiangxi soybeans on the market, arrivals have been scarce, with only a few dozen bags per batch, leading to a supply shortage. As a result, market sentiment has trended upward. Yesterday, two shipments of Jiangqiao (江橋) soybeans arrived, totaling only 99 bags, priced at $3.84, up 4 cents from the previous batch. 66 bags of 城門 (Chéngmén) soybeans were priced at $4.00, up 10 cents, but the quality was better than the previous batch. The goods were still being purchased by Ningbo merchants, and local streets had demand but no goods. If no substantial shipments arrive in the future, the market is likely to improve.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Hainan Brown Sugar Opening Prices Tighten</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trended steady. There was little change in the prices of granulated and refined sugar, as well as Taikoo sugar and native cotton white sugar in public board quotations. However, over 2,800 bags of domestic Hainan brown sugar, previously offered at lower prices, had been sold, and brokers showed strong interest. The market gradually saw a turnaround, with reports of prices rising by 20-30 cents in open trading and some transactions in after-hours trading.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: Luxiang Zhenmei Continues to Trend Firm and Rise</p>
<p>Sales of Luxiang and Zhenmei green tea continued to be brisk. Yesterday, companies such as Yingzhuang, Xiehe, Jinlong, Tongfu, and Fushi continued to make every effort to purchase. Total transaction volume for Zhenmei, Xiaomu, Mazhu, Zhenmei, Gongxi, and other items reached over 4,300 boxes. High-quality Zhenmei was priced as high as $95-96, up $2-3 from previous levels, and other items also showed a generally firm trend. However, the black tea market remained stagnant, with particularly sluggish sales of medium and low-grade teas from areas such as Lianghu and Ningzhou.</p>
<p>North-South Goods: Preserved Mustard Tuber Sales Rebound, Rising $2</p>
<p>Since the introduction of new Sichuan preserved mustard tubers, sales have been slow, leading to occasional price declines. It was found that the lowest opening price for sub-grade goods was no more than $8. Specializing merchants, who had previously suffered significant losses, took the opportunity to replenish their stocks. However, buyers have also sold over 10,000 jars of goods before and after, leaving approximately 12,000 jars in inventory. Yesterday, the market saw a $2 increase in opening prices.</p>

<p>Free Talk Miscellaneous Essays "The Decameron" by Mengjia</p>
<p>In 14th-century Italy, the economic situation had far surpassed that of Dante's time. Especially in Florence, the economic relations of this nascent capitalist era were particularly pronounced, giving rise to new social groups such as craftsmen, merchants, sailors, and other small urban property owners. The establishment of a new Italian culture meant that the medieval poetic style, Dante's "Divine Comedy"—with its idealistic symbolism, intense asceticism, and the belief that "earthly life is a valley of sorrow and sin, and all earthly things are baseless. The meaning and purpose of life lie in the negation of all earthly things, in religion, in the contemplation of God"—and the solemn figures of the great teachers of the Church and the founders of monasteries that flickered within it, were no longer suitable for the growth of new content and were replaced by prose novels. In this sense, Boccaccio's "Decameron" naturally replaced the position of the "Divine Comedy."</p>
<p>Of course, we must not overlook the features of the "Divine Comedy," created by Dante in the growing new cultural environment—such as taking "individuality" as the center of life, and its unrestrained and absurd dreamlike quality, which was the opposite of medieval poetry, and the sprouts of realistic creative methods that were revealed in this solemn symbolic idealistic artistic composition, etc. However, Dante's "Divine Comedy," in its main content, is still a spiritual form of expression of human society at the end of the Middle Ages, a record of the spiritual and soul life. It depicts emperors, kings, knights, saints, praises the spirit of asceticism, extremely despises all carnal pleasures, believes that earthly desires are sinful, and still sincerely admires and praises the "sublime" of hypocritical monks. From this, we can say without exaggeration that Dante's "Divine Comedy" is a poem of feudal religious culture.</p>
<p>In contrast, Boccaccio, the first person in the history of Italian realistic literature, boldly declares in his "Decameron" that carnal pleasure is a natural right of mankind, sings the praises of matter and carnal desire, and is convinced that those who believe that they are divorced from all worldly things as soon as they put on a cassock are just "fools." He opposes the asceticism of the Church with the doctrine that carnal pleasure is a natural right of mankind. He bitterly ridicules the hypocrisy of the foolish monastic society, portraying them as deceivers and "stupid philistines." He portrays these "red-faced, extremely fat, crowing like roosters, walking proudly with their chests puffed out, steeped in sin even to their ears, yet putting on the face of the master of heaven and dividing up places in heaven and the blessings of the Lord according to the amount of money" "noble" monks as laughable figures, like those clowns in China today who put on powder on their noses but wear long beards and pretend to be old men singing high-pitched tunes. He peels off the masks of the monks—who verbally advocate asceticism, praising it to the skies, but secretly hide wine and various spices in their rooms—giving them fatal and biting satire. He describes the temperament of those merchants who became rich from poverty, full of adventurous spirit and vigor, describes the worldly psychology of these new social classes, and their carnal and material daily life. All the characters in his works, regardless of their status, are excited and feel the joy of new life because of their physical health and worldly pleasures—here we can hear "the healthy laughter of those who live in material satisfaction, who are freed from the oppression of dark phantoms and painful remorse, who do not pin their hopes on gods and angels. But rely entirely on their own intelligence, invention, their own ability and adventurous heart," in short, on their own full and vibrant vitality in opening up new avenues of life. This laughter of joy arising from feeling the joy of life, like the crowing of a rooster at dawn, announces the coming of a new era. In this respect, the tone of "The Decameron" is completely different from the lyrical elegy of the "Divine Comedy," typically expressing the feelings of two classes with completely different fates.</p>
<p>Regarding the form of "The Decameron," we can say that it is base, that is, in the artistic sense, it is incomplete and trivial. In the one hundred stories, although the themes are diverse and rich, it uses a speaking storytelling method, so in the process of story development and its artistic composition, it lacks a sense of integrity and architecture. The characters of the protagonists are not obvious, flat, and not vivid, and the psychological descriptions are not profound. Therefore, although Boccaccio declared the birth of a new social stratum in "The Decameron," he did not perfectly depict the typical characters of this new character. At this point, Boccaccio only abstractly and plainly expressed the worldview of an emerging social group without concretely expressing the entire attitude of these new types in their real life, in their active actions, and in their inner spiritual life. This may be the most important reason. However, Boccaccio's use and deepening of the earlier Italian "extremely short stories with fantastic content" and making it establish its position in the history of Italian literature, and its advocacy of taking the self as the center, and using "realistic events and realistic characters" that do not contain symbolic meaning at all to replace the previous religious longing for "heaven" and the abstract allegorical characters in the poems of fantasy, he can be said to be the first old realist writer. Here, we emphasize Boccaccio's greatness not so much for his amazing formal refinement, elegance, and artistic completeness, but rather for the epoch-making nature of his creative methods, for his being the first old realist writer, for his being the first person to open up realistic literature in Italy and even Europe.</p>

<p>The train let out a hoarse roar, climbing out of the tunnel.</p>
<p>A night scene of a mountain village.</p>
<p>Rows of dark, oppressive thatched cottages lined the hillside. Occasionally, one or two points of amber light leaked from the wooden plank windows of the cottages.</p>
<p>In the deep, quiet midnight, the sound of frogs, like striking a fragile drum, seeped up from the grassy ponds of the village.</p>
<p>A piece of cloud, like delicately folded gauze, embraced a crescent moon. The moon led a group of lively stars, leisurely and slowly traveling across the sky.</p>
<p>The train, like a giant monster, panted and roared, climbing across a quiet and secluded countryside.</p>
<p>The surging river water, churning with waves; the quiet moonlight reflecting on the river, a distant patch of light, leaping like a candle flame in the heart of the water.</p>
<p>I gazed intently, at the early summer night scene outside the train window. The train carried my heart, gliding across the quiet, moonlit countryside.</p>
<p>Striking a paper cigarette, I silently savored the quiet taste of the night. The crescent moon quietly ascended to the mid-sky. When I looked out the window again, the plains of Dantu had already flown past the train window.</p>
<p>In the Gambling Den by Li Sanlang</p>
<p>——One of the Sketches of the Oriental Monte Carlo</p>
<p>Arrogant, this place is filled with a tense and stifling atmosphere. Although Macau relies on the vast sea coast, and a row of gambling den flags flutter in the sea breeze, once you step into the gambling den, it feels like being buried in hell, without enjoying any fresh air.</p>
<p>Inside, white, glaring lights are hung high, dazzling. However, because the people in the place are diligently or patiently smoking cigarettes, puffs of white-gray smoke rings spread upwards, filling the small hall. It makes people suspect that this is not a human world, but a world of demons.</p>
<p>People, mixed together, some dressed like elegant young men or wealthy merchants, while others wear only tattered clothes, mixing together without distinction, surrounding the rectangular tables. It's as if a group of hungry lambs are waiting for someone to stuff food into their mouths, their eyes wide with wild desire. Their faces are constantly jumping and convulsing, moving with the second hand of the clock.</p>
<p>In the summer, there are fierce electric fans, but no matter what, in the sunless southern gambling den, it is always depressing and fiery. People sweat, but their eyes are fixed on the action of the dealers, or on the money or banknotes on the square grids of the table. It's as if they have forgotten their own lives, sacrificing themselves entirely to the authority of money, which is like a sword.</p>
<p>In the winter, although there are no heaters, if you wear thick clothes and come in, you will always be unable to bear the stuffiness and heat and want to take your clothes off. Indeed, this place is always the same, a kind of heat that is not from the sun but a terrible stifling atmosphere.</p>
<p>There is no distinction between day and night here. There are only patient gamblers, perhaps burying their heads in the gambling den from morning. The emissaries of money will have soaked their heads with an anesthetic, and they will continuously, tirelessly, endure through the day and into the dark night. The clock hanging on the wall seems to have become a false shadow, and no real gambler ever notices the passage of time. In this way, they endure through the day and the night. Although they win ten or a hundred times their capital, no matter how suddenly they become rich, they still greedily, forgetting their own lives, sink down until all the money has safely slipped into the hands of others. Only then, with curses and remorse in their hearts, weary bodies, and confused heads, do they hobble out of the threshold. They then try to find some money, even if it means selling their wives and children, all sacrificed for the desire to gamble. Some clever gamblers, when they win a large sum of money here, run to the circles of glamorous women, intoxicating their lives. When they have no possibility of living, they quietly jump into the black sea. Or become gangsters. In reality, no one who comes here has a good outcome, only immersing one's life in poison.</p>
<p>The Oriental Monte Carlo of Macau is forever spinning like this without stopping!</p>
<p>A Corner of the Taihang Mountains (Part 1) by Lu Fen</p>
<p>The weather is clear, with two or three white clouds moving in the distant mountains. The mountain color is verdant, making the white of the clouds incomparably beautiful. The sunlight happily shines on the mountains, forests, villages. The dew of last night has not yet completely dissipated. The water carrier puts the bucket into the pond, making a gurgling sound, splashing clear water droplets. The wife washes clothes by the pond, chatting and laughing. The child drives the sheep up the mountain, constantly cracking the whip. The donkey occasionally brays loudly, and piglets waddle past on the roadside. All around is such a sweet, quiet, and peaceful scene, intoxicating!</p>
<p>The person called "Old Brother" took me to the small mountain at the end of the town. Needless to say, I had many strange ideas, listening to him greet the residents along the way.</p>
<p>Reaching the top of the mountain, "Old Brother" was still standing at the foot of the mountain, chatting with someone. That person was about forty years old, with a shaved head, wearing a gray robe, and carrying a pistol at his side. It was unclear what kind of person he was. Not like a thug, nor like a gentleman, but he had a shiny gold tooth, and was considered elegant among the residents. Not far behind him stood a young man, his face shaved like a freshly cut lawn, but his complexion was dark and lackluster. He was very handsome, and seemed like he could race with wolves if he shouted. His eyes were blank, emitting a cruel light, indicating that he was about to kill or be killed. He looked as agile as a small beast. He carried a German "Monk's Cap" rifle on his shoulder, and I was reminded of soldiers in the trenches.</p>
<p>The man calmly took off his rifle and fired a shot without any purpose. This seemed like a normal thing. A group of porters were passing by him, the bells ringing dong-dong, the mules and donkeys shook their big ears, and the drivers continued to crack their whips. The water carriers swayed their bodies, and clear water splashed on the ground. No one bothered to look at the gunshot and walked past.</p>
<p>According to "Old Brother," the person he was talking to was a landlord. The three brothers lived separately. One night, the eldest brother's family of eight were all slaughtered by a former district chief, simply because of a small ancestral grievance. Now they had moved to this town, and that man was his tenant and bodyguard.</p>
<p>University Days (36) by Storm, translated by Chen Yinzi</p>
<p>I also saw the 'Count of Dithmarschen', looking tired and sitting cross-legged on the other side of the hall. – I stood near him. When the musicians picked up their instruments, a young student came up to him. 'May I dance with Nellie this time?' he asked timidly. 'Next time, "youngster"!' the 'Count of Dithmarschen' replied, leaning his fine, pale head against the wall. The music began, but he did not stand up to invite his partner, only lazily raising his hand and gesturing to her with his fingers. I saw an angry look flash across her face, and then she hid her eyes inside the hand she was propping up, without standing up. The 'Count of Dithmarschen' frowned, and after a while got up, walked across the hall, and stood in front of her. – As she still did not look up, he put his arm around her and quickly lifted her up. He seemed to say two angry words, but I was standing too far away to hear them. Then he escorted her to the front of the other couples and began to dance.</p>
<p>She was already a tall girl, but her head only reached his chest. I watched them for a long time; her head was tilted back, her body seemingly only supported by his arm, only her toes touching the floor; he looked down at her, his hawk-like eyes fixed on her face, which was closed against him. After the dance, he took her back to her seat and let her gently slide from his arms onto the chair.</p>
<p>This rest was not long. Soon the whole hall was in commotion, the music played a quick tune, and the dancers quickly lined up in pairs.</p>
<p>The dancing began again, laughter and raucous shouts filling the entire circle; I saw those light little feet sliding quickly again and again over those dark spots. Faster and faster, and at the last spin, the poor children would have fallen to the ground, for they were spinning too fast.</p>
<p>Then, the music stopped abruptly; the dancing girls blushed and got up from the floor as the students laughed and walked away over their bodies, wiping the hair from their foreheads or shaking the dust off their carefully-made dancing dresses. I don't know whether this was due to the remnants of childish mischief or to the instinctive movement of all people to show resistance to something they cannot escape the magic of? It seemed that these college students did not think they had sufficiently insulted the women.</p>
<p>My eyes never left Nellie. They sat alone in the place where the 'Count of Dithmarschen' had taken her. She seemed to suppress herself so that no one invited her to dance in that dance.</p>
<p>After a while, people solemnly and deliberately danced the 'contre-danse', as if intentionally indicating the opposite nature of that dance. At this time I went into the side room with an acquaintance. We met many old students, and soon a glass of beer was placed in front of everyone, and we talked a great deal about what the results of this exam might be.</p>
<p>When the music next door stopped, several couples came up to us and sat down at the table. The 'Count of Dithmarschen' and Nellie were among them.</p>
<p>Summer Scene on the Street: Calling "Brother" by Tianji</p>
<p>Essays and Education by Qinwen</p>
<p>If literature is indeed "cultivation," and essays at least have a large part of the elements of literature, then its relationship with education is not a problem. Moreover, within the scope of literature, the relationship between essays and education is closer than that of novels and plays. Not to mention anything else, just check the textbooks and selected readings, no matter which bookstore publishes them, you can see that the number of essays is greater than that of novels and plays. In classical Chinese, many "miscellaneous sayings" are always selected. This is certainly because essays are short and clever, making it easy for students to understand and feel interested, and also because essays are refined, every sentence has force, and every place is outstanding and eye-catching, which can unconsciously arouse students' desire to try. Unlike novels and plays, which require reading the entire long piece to understand the intention, if only a part is read, some places are inevitably inexplicable and feel ordinary and tasteless. In the classroom, it is inconvenient to read long works in one breath, so essays occupy a superior position.</p>
<p>The above is only about textbooks. In fact, essays are also suitable for extracurricular reading; simple and clear, easy for self-study; gentle and moving, after reading a little, one will naturally be reluctant to put it down. "Historical essays" and "scientific essays" are not only beneficial in writing but also useful for various subjects and can be called a powerful tool for "supplementary education." Moreover, it is even more beneficial to "social education," which can be understood from the large number of essays published in general newspapers and magazines.</p>

<p>Shen Bao Local Supplement</p>
<p>Speaking of Shanghai Hosting the Ghost Festival Again by Xing An</p>
<p>The seventh lunar month has arrived again, and Shanghai people are making a fuss about holding the Ghost Festival. Shanghai people live in this unique commercial hub in the country, taking the lead in the world's trends. Logically, customs should change a bit. The change to the Gregorian calendar has been rigorously implemented by the government for several years, but Shanghai people still feign compliance while actually disobeying, celebrating their lunar New Year. National Day and days of national humiliation can be skipped over, but when it comes to welcoming gods and holding festivals, they cannot help but happily participate. Now that the time for the Ghost Festival has arrived, Shanghai people will inevitably be busy again, holding grand Taoist rituals. These days, a bunch of idle people in Shanghai are actively going around collecting money from house to house, promoting the grand event. The streets and alleys are also decorated with lanterns and colored banners, preparing for the excitement. The superstitious beliefs of Shanghai people are truly unbreakable.</p>
<p>Naturally, Shanghai people have their own incredibly foolish intentions for holding the Ghost Festival, which is to pray for the peace of the area. But as I see it, the peace of Shanghai is already as peaceful as it can be. Currently, the provinces are suffering from major floods, and hundreds of thousands of disaster victims are in dire straits, crying out to heaven and earth. This kind of unpeaceful scene is enough to make you feel sad and miserable! However, Shanghai people are probably indifferent to this, not concerned at all.</p>
<p>The other day, Mr. Ma Xiangbo issued an appeal to the people of the country to save and help disaster victims, pleading for the lives of the disaster victims. I believe that there will not be many people in the country who can truly mobilize their compassion, save on clothing and food, and generously donate. Because this directly affects personal life. It would be a truly meritorious act if Shanghai people saved the useless waste of holding Taoist rituals this month and donated it to the disaster area to help rescue the victims! Saving living people is much more charitable than saving dead people. However, my proposal is also a kind of extravagant hope? Maybe Shanghai people are mostly determined to save the Taoist rituals at all costs, even if the disaster victims go unsaved.</p>
<p>Then there is a need to ban this bad custom. Yesterday, I heard that the Social Affairs Bureau believes that holding the Ghost Festival in this city is promoting superstition and wasting money and manpower to the extreme. At a time when the provinces are suffering from terrible floods and the disaster victims are waiting for help, how can we use the money earned with blood and sweat for useless consumption? We should find ways to ban it to reverse the decadent trend. It was reported that officials had been sent to consult with the Public Security Bureau a few days ago. In addition to the two bureaus jointly issuing a notice, the Public Security Bureau will also issue orders to all subordinates to strictly prohibit it. Let's see what the state of the Shanghai Public Ritual for Peace will be this year.</p>
<p>The Knife Sharpener by Cun Yin</p>
<p>My little knife was rusty.</p>
<p>Because I didn’t have time to sharpen it, I asked an old scissors sharpener to do the job for me.</p>
<p>The old man’s clothes were tattered, like the dried fur of a stray dog running wild on the street with no home to go to. His face was covered with veins. The gray stubble under his chin moved with the two red and white lips. Judging from his two lifeless eyes, I really didn’t know how much misfortune he had suffered.</p>
<p>After he accepted my little knife, he straddled his narrow, dirty stool. He looked at the knife carefully, frowned his two old eyebrows, and said with great difficulty:</p>
<p>"Sir, seven copper coins, please! It's really not easy to sharpen.”</p>
<p>This sentence was clearly intended to ask me for a few more coins. His attitude was very sincere, very timid. Perhaps because of his pitiful appearance, I agreed without hesitation.</p>
<p>"The steel of this knife is very good, sir!"</p>
<p>With a smile on his face, he spoke to me so diligently that I felt embarrassed. "Why be like this, old man? I'm taking out money, and you're expending effort! Why be so ingratiating? Our exchange is so fair..." I wanted to say this to him, but some kind of consciousness stopped me. I had to return a smile on my face to him.</p>
<p>So, on a brick, it resonated with a "Kagukagu" sound. (The sound of my little knife hovering above it).</p>
<p>His dry muscles, bare chest, several bones, and yellow skin all wriggled with the strange, piercing sound of "Kagukagu". I seemed to see an old, outdated machine.</p>
<p>Standing next to him, watching this living machine moving back and forth, I became a little impatient. I saw a small, round hole in his ear, which was very strange, so I asked him:</p>
<p>"The hole in your ear, it's really strange.”</p>
<p>"Yes, it's been four or five years." His painful voice had no long breath. His pitiful eyes turned to look at me, then he cast his eyes on the little knife that his hands were pushing. Then, he murmured to himself towards the little knife hovering on the brick: "That year, the place where I lived started to have war. -- Sir, we Jiangbei people have too many hard lives. -- Soldiers passed in rows in front of my thatched house. Later, we heard the sound of guns and cannons. Later, we saw the red light all over the sky, and the surrounding houses, and our row of thatched houses, were all burned down by the soldiers. We ran for our lives! We wanted to escape this terrible place. We stepped on the still groaning corpses. Our shoes were soaked with the blood flowing on the ground. We ran for our lives! It was at that time that a stray bullet passed through my ear. At that time, I didn’t feel any pain at all, and when I rested and hid in a ditch, I realized that the clothes on my shoulder were soaked with blood..."</p>
<p>His hands stopped, and his head also lifted up. He looked at me sternly and said frantically:</p>
<p>"It would have been better to die at that time, sir. It would have saved me from such suffering."</p>
<p>"You are so lucky, you still have the strength, you will not suffer.” I could only comfort him like this. Apart from this, what else could I say? Although there was so much to say, some kind of consciousness stopped me again. It was too painful, I couldn't say my words directly.</p>
<p>The "Kagukagu" sound slowed down. He had sharpened my little knife very brightly and sharply.</p>
<p>"Is this good, sir? Such a fast knife, can kill many of our enemies."</p>
<p>"Do you also understand enemies?" I said ironically.</p>
<p>He smiled bitterly, without answering.</p>
<p>I paid him seven copper coins, and he carried his stool on his back, carried endless pain. We all parted with bitter smiles. Parted!</p>
<p>The Suffering Woman by Jian Bi</p>
<p>Her internal experience of ten years in the nunnery was even more important than her chanting and worship. Previously, she had not revered any religious thoughts, but now she considered it utter absurdity because "utter absurdity" had given rise to the desire to "repent and do good." She was now praying, practicing asceticism, and repenting to seek salvation. But human will is ultimately weak and cannot withstand strong temptations. After ten years without incident, in the eleventh year, she was thrown out of the door of asceticism and enlightenment as if being punished by God.</p>
<p>"No matter how strong your will is, you can't overcome natural impulses!" Martin Luther's words once again accurately told her the inevitability of her behavior.</p>
<p>Living in a fluctuating environment, the cold and warm tastes of twenty years of life were mostly occupied by the bitterness in her memories. For her own inexplicable life history, each page was splattered with blood and tears, and each page was absurd.</p>
<p>Unbearable loneliness forced her to rationally believe in religion. The chanting and worship in the incense mist of her ancestors and mothers now made her laugh at their cleverness and whip herself for being foolish. The grandfather's concubine and the father's extramarital affair were originally the "reasons for belief in God" of the ancestors and mothers. As for herself, it was more accurate to say that she felt empty because she loved too much!</p>
<p>Page 20</p>
<p>However, the nunnery was ultimately a sacred Buddhist site. The desperate attempt to restrain emotions by entrusting them to the wooden fish could not last. She understood the reason for this. Then she remembered a certain story about why a male gardener had been the target of many nuns. The still lake of her heart began to ripple.</p>
<p>On a clear moonlit night, when the silvery moonlight kissed the shadows of the trees on the ground, when the amorous god of spring night descended with light wings, she gently chanted a famous poem:</p>
<p>"Power and life have flown far away,</p>
<p>Friends are gone, joy is dead;</p>
<p>The honor that once nourished me is also gone,</p>
<p>Belief is on my weak star.</p>
<p>The time of people's short lives is fruitless.</p>
<p>All the good things that life has given me</p>
<p>Are the floods of tears that comfort my heart,</p>
<p>All things must return to dust,</p>
<p>Except for that neat, beautiful, and secluded thing – nature's spring night."</p>
<p>Like the realism, moving, and magical descriptions in novels, a head poked out from the dark corner of the house, whispering:</p>
<p>"Darling, let's go! It's almost time, the train is already rolling its wheels, listen..."</p>
<p>Two shadows were printed in horror on the moonlit earth. The man's hat moved like a small umbrella under the moon.</p>
<p>From then on, she was once again covered in the dust of the world.</p>
<p>After Today I Am Going to Close the Store (One of the Features) by Qin Jian</p>
<p>The weather is getting hot like fire, and the cicadas are screaming like slaughtering pigs on the branches again. At this time, in a metropolis filled with countless souls seeking a living, on the walls of street corners, mixed in with posters for menstrual pills and theater advertisements, a pile of small and crooked autumn enrollment advertisements for "alleyway elementary schools" will appear again. They are posted and distributed everywhere, using moving and accommodating words such as "popular education, reduced tuition fees, enrollment at any time" to replace the store's "preferential treatment for customers, small profits and quick sales."</p>
<p>So, walking on the street, walking in the prosperous area of residences and shops, in street after street, among the signs of doctors or fortune-tellers, it is easy to find the sign of an elementary school. There, the nearby residents, those living a not-so-comfortable life, will send their children to become part of the clientele under the principles of proximity, convenience, and economy, paying tuition fees of six or seven yuan per semester. There they are being educated, being guided, being formed, like a piece of wood that is left (no, entrusted) in an inferior carpenter's shop, lacking nutrition and care, drifting and growing up.</p>
<p>In any alleyway that is "prosperous and conveniently located," after a little calculation, one can rent a residential house and let the living room serve as the principal's office, the two厢房 (xiāngfáng) rooms upstairs and downstairs are divided into four classrooms (maybe you want to run a complete elementary school? But it doesn't matter, you can adopt the "multiple-grade education method" and implement "combined classes"), and the upper and lower亭子間 (tíngzijiān) rooms are used as the dormitories for the principal and teachers. Finally, the remaining楼中間 (ló</p>

<h3 id="e176">Yarn: Marked Yarn Experiences Drastic Drop <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to decline, showing signs of instability. Fluctuations are frequent, making it difficult to predict. This situation is entirely due to the wavering minds of speculators who alternately buy and sell. According to market rumors, some large positions have been released recently, leading followers to rush to close their positions. At the same time, the spot yarn market is becoming increasingly quiet, and the market is falling more and more sharply.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Plummets by More Than Two Dollars</p>
<p>At the opening of the marked yarn market, due to the massive purchases by peers the previous day, the sentiment was extremely bullish. The near-term contract rose by more than one dollar, and the distant contract rose by seventy or eighty cents. The situation in the second round remained tight, rising another seventy or eighty cents. By the third round, it was heard that spot yarn transactions were sluggish, and most transactions were for Japanese yarn. At the close, the market suddenly plummeted. The market situation changed drastically, because the person in charge of a certain party profited from releasing their own long positions of 1,000-2,000 bales. When the news broke, people were shaken, and followers rushed to close their positions. The market plunged by more than two dollars. As a result, the near-term contract rose by thirty cents compared to the previous day's close, while the distant contract fell by one dollar and fourteen cents. At the afternoon opening, the market remained weak. Rumors spread that the bulls were releasing positions, which was favorable to the bears, and Changfeng also began to dump a significant volume of over three thousand bales, causing the market to loosen significantly. As a result, the near-term contract fell by two dollars compared to the previous day, while the distant contract fell by eighty or ninety cents to one dollar and thirty cents. According to the investigation, the sellers included Da Feng with 1,000 bales, Tong Ji with 900 bales, Ming De with 1,200 bales, Zhen Da with 850 bales, He Xing with 500 bales, Ren Feng with 1,400 bales, Yong Chang with 900 bales, Yong Da with 600 bales, Chang Feng with 3,550 bales, and Run Kang with 1,100 bales, and Shen Yu with 700 bales. The buyers included Jin Chang with 1,800 bales, Da Ji with 900 bales, Shen Ji with 2,000 bales, Yi Chang with 2,450 bales, Run Kang with 700 bales, Geng Feng with 1,300 bales, and Rui Da with 400 bales. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Spot Sales Only Exceed 500 Bales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are sluggish. According to statistics, various guilds purchased a total of 553 bales throughout the day. The purchase volume of each guild is as follows:</p>
<p>The cotton market is weakening, and the downward trend is intensifying. Because the bulls have been pushing up prices too aggressively for several days, they are now closing their positions when faced with unfavorable conditions, causing the downward trend to sharpen. However, large-scale bulls have not yet released their positions. Nevertheless, market rumors have subsided, and marked gold prices are stable. New buyers are temporarily stopping.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Zheng Marked Cotton Continues to Decline <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>At the opening of the marked cotton market, buyers gathered, because the bulls had been actively buying and adding to their positions the previous day, and their volumes were quite large, so they were bidding up prices even more aggressively. The current month broke through the six-dollar mark, and the distant months rose by twenty or thirty cents. By the second and third rounds, prices turned downward because rumors subsided and marked gold prices stabilized. As a result, prices for all months fell by one and a half to three cents compared to the previous day's close. In the afternoon, the bulls continued to close their positions, and sentiment was weak, with prices rising but then loosening. However, the bulls for the August contract remained strong. As a result, the current month fell by one and a half cents compared to the morning close, while the distant months fell by two and a half to three and a half cents. According to the investigation, the sellers included Tong He with 1,400 dan, Chang Feng with 1,500 dan, Tong Ji with 1,600 dan, Ji Feng with 1,400 dan, Ming De with 1,100 dan, Ren Feng with 2,000 dan, Yuan Yi with 1,000 dan, Sheng Yuan with 2,100 dan, Yong Chang with 4,600 dan, Yi Feng with 4,300 dan, and Chang He with 2,800 dan. The buyers included Chang Yu with 1,200 dan, Geng Feng with 1,500 dan, Yuan Da with 1,300 dan, Da Fu with 4,000 dan, Shen Chang with 1,400 dan, Rui Da with 1,800 dan, Shen Ji with 3,500 dan, Yi Chang with 3,300 dan, Chang Feng with 2,500 dan, Rui Yuan with 1,300 dan, and Yong Da with 1,400 dan. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Factory Demand is Slightly Improving</p>
<p>Spot cotton sales are slightly more active. The sources include 236 bales of Yao cotton and 200 bales of Tongzhou cotton.</p>
<p>Good Forecast for New Tongzhou and Ningbo Cotton</p>
<p>"Tongzhou": This year's cotton crop in Tongzhou is expected to be abundant based on the current conditions. It is estimated that it can produce 2 million dan. The cotton fields have increased by about 10% compared to last year. "Ningbo": Regarding Yao cotton, the cotton fields in the area have increased this year, and cotton cultivation has improved. In addition, the weather is favorable. It is estimated that 600,000 dan can be harvested. According to the investigation, the actual harvest last year was 400,000 dan.</p>
<p>American Cotton Traders Buying as Prices Decline</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with quiet and firm conditions due to traders buying October contracts and a lack of sellers. Prices for all months rose by one to four points. The news regarding the new cotton loan was uncertain, so traders waited for Washington's statement. The weather and harvest news were favorable. Spot demand was stagnant, and factory inventories were low. In the afternoon, the stock market and wheat market were strong, and local firms covered short positions. Liverpool's selling absorbed the long liquidation. Finally, short covering emerged, and Washington's buying caused prices to rise again. Spot prices rose by ten points, and futures prices rose by ten to sixteen points. There was little trading in Indian cotton. Retailers and the public made slight purchases. Plain Goel rose by half a rupee, Olm La rose by 0.25 rupees, and White Row Creek rose by 0.5 to 0.75 rupees. Original telegraph recorded to the left (dated 31st).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for White Row Creek cotton for the April/May term on the 1st was 219 rupees, up two rupees from the previous day's close.</p>
