<p>— 恒</p>
<p>英現首相包爾溫上月下句曾稱英美兩國苟能合作卽爲世界和平最有效之保障此言至確然英美合作傳之已久而實現似尚有待溯自東省事變發生美之史汀生卽請英國共同行動去年倫敦海軍預備談話後英美又有合作之傾向今春以來此種空氣尤見濃厚如李頓訪美力言英美有合作之必要南菲斯墨茨將軍同時亦謂英美非合作不可此種論調往往隨遠東時局而起落每當時局緊張則合作聲浪忽高及至時局緩和合作空氣卽趨沉寂故其意雖善而無補事實最近華北事起英美兩方又有將運用九國公約以資應付之說然亦迄未有何動作此中癥結何在誠值得注意之問題也　依我人觀察英美對於合作一事所以僅具空洞之意向遲遲未有行動者蓋有數因一爲歐洲局面法德尚在對峙意亦雄心勃勃隨時有危及歐洲和平之虞歐洲不靖英國勢難他顧二則英美合作之目的無非欲約束日本之行動設日本不受約束勢必取决於戰爭然此種戰爭適資蘇俄以發展之機會亦非英美之所願故英美對俄若無控制之把握自必不欲開罪日本此種畏俄之心理以英爲尤甚良以蘇俄勢力一旦膨脹英國亞洲寶藏之印度首將蒙受極大之威脅也三則。美國貨幣貶價之行動使英蒙受甚大之損失同時英國對於戰債之延不償付。形同賴債亦使美國大感不快深以再蹈上次參戰之前轍爲戒此皆英美難以切實合作之原因也</p>
<p>基上數因可知英美合作之關鍵一在歐洲集體和平制之能否確立二在英美對蘇俄今後勢力之膨脹將爲若何之處置三在英美自身間之經濟關係能否調整據最近外電所傳英德海約成立後英國仍圖進行訂立二月三日英法倫敦宣言中之各種公約以推動歐洲之集體和平制度歐洲和平如能確立英之目光卽可移於遠東。又據近日消息英美又有再度召開國際貨幣會議之醞釀英美間之經濟關係因此或亦有恊調之望是則英美合作其有成爲事實之可能歟唯我人所當注意者英美合作卽使一旦實現亦未必有將日本勢力剷除之作用就現勢推測合作前途至多亦不過將今日歐洲淮行之集體和平制度推行於遠東使有關遠東利益之國家共同參加以抑制其中任何一國之自由行動而已觀於目下英人對日仍以維持親善關係爲言而美國海軍幹部主張儀對日本採取防守政策羅斯福總統且屢屢吿誡軍人勿作危害邦交之言論則英美遠東政策之分量亦從可知矣</p>
<h3 id="c19">英法談話順利結束　仍合作以定歐局　一般問題英允法保證　德國現有重返國聯說 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>（巴黎）英法合作最近所生之裂痕、今日英國不管部閣員艾登開始其修治工作、艾登抵巴黎後卽由法總理賴伐爾設宴欵待、宴舉卽作海軍軍備談話、嗣賴氏發表文吿如下、「英德兩國近所訂之海軍協定、茲具完全誠意研究、艾登以英政府所以作此决議之理由爲吿、而余乃重行聲明法政府關於此事之保留、余與艾登個人之關係殊足證明談話之友好性質、吾人並共同研究歐洲大局所呈現於吾人兩政府之各種問題、吾人承認兩國政府有密切合作之必要」云、談論進行中、雙方所發表之友誼之強烈精神使人咸感樂觀、覺英法間因英德海軍協定之結果而密播之陰霾行將歸於消滅、法國仍堅持西歐天空公約速同東歐公約與多瑙河公約爲一不可分裂之整個物、其中數部或可分開談判、但僅能同時成立、聞賴伐爾曾問艾登英國是否仍守此原則、蓋此爲本年二月間兩國在倫敦所商妥者、英國當時尤願天空公約早日完成、勿待中歐東歐問題解决後再事此舉、而英國今似不循此途徑也、艾登答稱、渠須先行商諸政府云、雙方談話明日將繼續進行、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）現在巴黎之英國不管部大臣艾登頃與英國政府互通電話、關於法國提出之意見有所詢問、聞英國政府表示、關於天空協定與海軍協定兩項擬與法國以若干保證、關於天空協定、非經羅加諾公約各簽字國全體參加、英國决不與德國單獨締結、至於英德海軍協定成立後、如法國增加海軍造艦、則英國不應以此爲理由而增造軍艦、此層亦爲英國所承認云、（二十二目哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）此間今日得悉、希特勒大概已允重返國聯、以爲英國贊同其重整軍備之交換條件、此間一般人咸信艾登已向賴伐爾總理陳述此事、並視爲英國簽訂對德海軍協定之一部份理由、聞艾登與賴伐爾談話時、曾要求賴伐爾考慮下列四項建議、（一）西歐各國卽行締結空軍公約、德國或可包括在內、（）二艾登撮述英德海軍協定簽字前希特勒之讓步、（三）德國重整軍備已成事實、英國之目的在於竭力遏止之、英國希望此舉能制止歐洲之軍備競爭、（四）要求英法意三國繼續合作、一般人信艾登又獲一外交勝利、而挽回英法决裂之危機、法國對於英國簽訂對德海軍協定初雖表示駭異、惟認準一步談判德國軍備問題之門戶現已開啟矣、（二十一日國民電」</p>
<h3 id="c20">賴伐爾之宣言　考慮合作方式辦法　信守集體和平制度 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>（巴黎）英法談話業於本日午後三點十五分告竣、英國不管部大臣艾登卽將啟程赴羅馬、自羅馬返國時、當經過巴黎、與賴伐爾總理作再度之會晤、按今晨艾登在電話中與英國內閣磋商後、談判前途已趨於順利、惟英國政府以爲法國所提出之問題、性質甚爲嚴重、故須俟內閣會議加以討論後、方可作切實之决定、英法談話吿畢後、賴伐爾總理發表宣言謂、「吾人業將目前國際局勢引起之各項問題、加以考慮、吾人並參照二月三日之英法宣言書、審議兩國政府合作之方式吾人咸認爲尋覓實際方式以解决倫敦宣言書所提出之各項問題、實有必要、則以此項問題、不僅有關兩國、且興歐洲其他國家、亦均有關也、」賴伐爾繼復聲明、兩國政府對於集體安全政策、當信守不變云、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）據可靠方面消息英國雖邀請法國海軍專家前往倫敦舉行談話但法國不擬派遺專家赴英、至少在目前不擬作此種談話、惟在本年年底舉行之海軍會議、則法國當可參加、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）法國政府曾於六月十七日照會英國政府、對於英德海軍協定、提出若干意見、茲悉英國政府已以答覆法國之照會一件、送交法國駐英大使戈爾平轉遞法國政府、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>英大使請俄參加會議</p>
<p>（莫斯科）英大使季斯敦已將英德海軍會議結果通知蘇俄外交委員長李維諾夫、並稱英國希望俄亦參加海軍會議、以期完成質及量之戴軍、英政府與關係國談判之進行情形亦將隨時通知蘇俄政府、李維諾夫當答稱、允將英國建議呈報人民委員會、並悉蘇俄已令倫敦巴黎及羅馬之蘇俄大使將本國政府對海軍問題以及空軍公約問題之意見吿知駐九俄國政府、（二十一日國民社電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）蘇聯重工業委員會公報論英德海軍協定、謂「無論如何、有一事已明瞭、卽縱令英國外長如何聲明、英德海軍恊定旣未裁減海軍軍備、亦未鞏固歐洲之安全」、（二十一日塔斯社電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）眞理報指出英德海軍恊定對於全部國際現勢將有更大之後果、謂「德國軍備之增加將用作英國擴充海軍之藉口、於是法意等國亦將步其後塵、故此恊定之目的確爲開發一軍備競爭、此協定實爲海陸空裁軍思想之棺上之最後一釘」、（二十一日塔斯社電）</p>
<p>英德代表議造艦程序</p>
<p>（倫敦）德國海軍首席代表里本特洛浦午後與外相霍爾爵士再度會談、並與海軍大臣孟塞爾及海軍總參謀長郤德飛會晤、大抵英德兩國海軍專家、若能儘明日之內、將德國造艦程序確實擬定、則德國代表團將於星期日返國、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）「時報評論英國不管部大臣艾登巴黎這憲、謂「海軍與空軍、關係英國最為重要、為英國計、當首先予以解决、此層固爲菩人所瞭解、然德國之陸上軍備、不僅關係法國安全、最為重要、且亦有關大陸各國之安全、此層則希望吾英國友人亦能加以瞭解、蓋英國目前之外交方策、與斯德萊柴及日內瓦之各國合作政策、本已格格不相入、而吾法國則尤深感惶惑與不安、艾登於歐洲局勢、洞若觀火、未有不明此理者也」云、「強硬報」亦作同樣論調、謂英國倘表裏一致、眞正希望英法兩國合作、則艾登此行、自必向法國聲明、凡關於當前各項國際問題、英國均願與法國合作、夫合作本無問題、問題乃在於如何合作、假使英國不能與法國切實合作、則法國卽無須與英國合作、關於此層、艾登實負有明白解釋之責、吾人其企而待之」云、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）各報對於英法兩國巴黎談話、大體表示樂觀、每日電聞報謂、「吾人有良好理由、足以相信明晚必有進展、截止目前為止、英法兩國對於答復德國備忘錄之詞語、業已商得同意、德國此項備忘錄、對於法俄互助條約、提出異議、謂興羅卡諾公約所規定之義務相抵觸、要求羅卡諾公約各簽字國加以說明、」泰晤士報謂「法國賴伐爾總理昨日與不管部大臣艾登談畢之後、會謂法車所提保留、仍繼續存在、由此可見法國政府仍以英德海軍協定、無論在精神上或在文字上、均與英法意三國聯合陣綫相背馳、所幸艾登應付適當、能使法國方面發生深刻印象、雙方淡話、明日當有成功之望」云云、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）英德海軍協定之成立、此間認為係德車外交之最大成功、且為各項國際談判之一新出發點、德國外交部人士、力稱此項協定、係外交上之一大勝利、而國社黨方面則以為五月二十一日希特勒演說中所主張達到權利平等之程序、已獲得具體之承認、且謂此次英德海軍談話、係由希特勒新信里本特洛浦一手辦理、故德國與英國接近、亦即係希特勒個人之成功、半官式方面並以爲希特勒所著「我的鬥爭」一書中、曾抨擊大戰前之德國海軍政策而主張與英國協調、今希特勒此種主張、業已成爲事實、德國旣承認英國海軍之優勢、則英國對於德國在中歐之企圖、自亦可以鮮加顧問矣、國社黨方面現正紛紛議論、謂里本特洛浦或可赴巴黎一行、俾設法與法國訂結與英德恊定相類似之協定云、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞問題不談</p>
<p>（羅馬）英國出席國聯專員艾登將於今晚或明晨蒞此、據政界確息、艾登會晤墨索里尼首相時、決定不談阿比西尼來問題、其使命僅以接洽海軍問題爲限、卽國聯對於阿比西尼亞最近提出之新照會、亦將無形擱置、蓋調解委員會現正研究意阿爭案、不宜另生枝節云、（二十二日國民社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）艾登對新聞記者之談話、證明彼與賴伐爾確未提及阿比西尼亞問題、更由各報評論而觀、法國實不欲予意人以干涉意阿爭端之印象、法國此種態度、一爲英德海軍協定簽字後之直接結果、亦爲法國報紙屢次警吿當局勿再逼迫意國退出國聯所致、艾登吿新聞記者、待彼自羅馬返英後、將主張與法談判阿意問題云、（二十二日國民電）</p>

<p>「但願能這樣。」</p>
<p>「你還不該爲我賀喜麽？」羅菲扯走話頭。「你該歡喜呀。」</p>
<p>陸文果然笑了，不但只是笑，他還跳了跳脚。</p>
<p>「我自然該爲你賀喜的，等一會我替你買件謝體。」</p>
<p>兩個人沿着馬路左邊又在人行路上走起來，他們往家裏走，人雖有此累，此時却平添了很多的氣力，他們的樣子很傲然，天也似乎故意顯得明亮來光照着他們的前路。</p>
<p>「我還忘記問你了，你從什麽時候正式開始作事？」陸文忽然想起來事情。「什麽時候開始？」</p>
<p>「明大九點。」</p>
<p>「明天你就是憫有職業的人了。一</p>
<p>「明大我們的生活就有點着落了。」</p>
<p>可是陸文又想到別有居心的事情上。爲什麽他偏要想起這一套？他難過。他認爲妻子的求業絕對不是技藝成功的，實在是和妓女黃色相差不多。然而把妻子關在家裏作良妻賢母又不是他的主張，他一向是贊成女子跟男子同樣要爲社會服務，女子跟男子同樣要作些事情的。</p>
<p>沒有職業時，怕尋不到職業，有了職業，又想到別的枝節問題上，多麽矛盾啊。</p>
<p>羅菲也正在回想經理家中過去的一刻，一想起來，她就有些爲後日的自己躭心。經理的輕薄如果繼續下去，她可怎樣對付？她這個職業的存留，也繫在他的手中，只要他一時不高興，她就可以作犧牲品。看來她不能違背著他的意思作事，但這樣一來，以後的問題就多了。想來想去想不出穩妥的辦法，最後的决定還是像他回答陸文的詁去作：事在人爲。她還加上一番解說：合則留，不合則去。</p>
<p>陸文走着走着買了兩包花生米，自己留下一包，另外一包遞給他的妻子，笑着說：</p>
<p>一菲，這就是我慶賀你的禮物。」</p>
<p>「太薄了。好，禮薄義重。」</p>
<p>羅菲也笑天了。</p>
<p>海關大鐘正指十二點，公司銀行的小職員們有乘公共汽車的，有乘電車的回到家裏去用餐，還有到就近的飯館去飽腹。每部車子都擠得很厲害，「後頭一部，一賣票人大聲喊呌着。</p>

<p>劉主席·各位同志、今天我們成都各界領袖、仍舊集合在這裹舉行總理紀念週、我所要對各位說的話、就是繼續上次紀念週所講的意思、將我們各界領袖應該怎樣使一般所有受我們教導的人、無論是家裹的子弟、學校裹的學生、以及各機關各軍隊裹的部屬、都能明折在天地間做人的道理、和對於社會國家應負的責任、而能各盡其才為社會國家而用、我們要能做到這一步、必須各界負責的領袖、能夠以身作則、並且教導得法、講到教育的方法、從前我們古人教人、無論家庭教育·學校教育·社會教育、都是文事與武藝並重、文武合一、術德兼修、不僅要使受教的人、懂得文事、並且要使他懂得武藝、因爲一個人如果不懂得武藝、就不能自衛、不能保護鄉里、更不能保衛國家、和民族、可是現在的教育、忘掉了這個最緊要的道理、文武完全分途、文人不學武藝武人不知文事、馴至養成重文輕武的惡習、結果、每個人最多也祇知道一半的道理、因此就沒有完全的學問、也沒有完全的人格、不能完全盡到他做人的責任、所以我們社會國家要弄到這般積弱的情形、和危亡的地步、大家要知道現在世界上凡是一等強國他們的教育、未有不文武合一而並重兼修的、可以說是他們教育的方法、與我們古人的方法、完全相同、例如英美法意日所謂五大強國、無不如此、尤其是現代各新興國家、如德·如俄·如土·更無不首重武藝、不僅男子要習武、就是女子也要習武、所以他們能夠發揚剛健強毅的民族精神、造成磅礴偉大的民族力量、完成他們復興國家民族的事業、由此、可見我們要做現代的國民、要從衰敗危亡之中、復興我們的國家民族、就是矯正過去重文輕武的惡習、恢復古人「文武合一」的教育、要使全國同胞、無論男男女女老老少少、都有武藝、都能自衛衛國、其次、我們學習武藝、應當從什麼地方着手呢、唯一緊要之事、就是先要銀鍊強健的體魄、因爲國民如果沒有強健的體魄、便沒有強健的精神和充足的力量、可以來盡國民的責任、如此、國家便不能強盛、民族便不能復興、要使國家強盛、民族復興、就非先使國民的體魄強健不可、至於鍜鍊體魄的方法、當然很多、現在我可以提出一個最扼要的原則、就是和自然界「日光·空氣·水·」這三伴東西奮鬥、我們無論在家庭裏教育子弟、在學校裏教育學生、或是在軍隊裏教育士兵、都要以身作則、使在家時時刻刻和「日光·空氣·水·」這三種東西來奮鬥、從嚴寒酷暑狂風驟雨霜雪抖霰各種惡劣的氣候之中、不斷鬥爭來鍛鍊我們的體魄、普通一般人、到了熱天就怕熱、到了冬天就怕冷、在炎天烈日之下、便怕蒸晒、在大雨大雪的時候、便怕濕怕凍、不敢出去工作、這簡直是爲自然界所屈服了、我們要克復天然、越是在最冷最熱的時候、越要出外工作、越是大風大雪的時候、越要興奮努力、日光·空氣·水·這三伴東西如果我們不能制服他、就要受制於他、這種人就不會有什麼作爲、凡是有志之士、無論遇着氣候怎樣冷熱、日光怎樣厲害、雨雪怎樣大、總是相他們來鬥爭、如此、一定可以克復他們、鍜鍊成銅筋鐵骨的體魄、就可以頂天立地、成功立業、但是現在不僅一般文學校對於這種鍜鍊身體的重要方法、沒有注意、就是普通視爲專講武藝的軍隊、也沒有確實做到這一點、大家旣然都不知道用這種方法來鍜鍊身體、所以我們一般國民的體魄和精神、一天天衰弱下來、無怪國家民族、也就一天一天的衰敗了、因此、今後無論文的武的、或農工商學各界的領袖、都要知道教人的第一要務、在於鍛鍊其體格、使其一天一天的臻於強健、這一點、比較其他任何事情、任何學問、都更重要、當然我們要使一般國民身體強健、對害於一切足以戕身體的惡劣嗜好、如鴉片嫖賭之類、都先要使他們戒絕、但是要我們以身作則、對他們講明一個人在世界中競生圖存、必須先求健身的道理、而使他們和日光水等自然界去鬥爭、他們當然就不會再去吸烟或嫖賭了、我們教人總要從這種鍜鍊體魄的工夫做去、然後才可以教到其他的學問道德、也必須體魄健強、才可以發揮其一切聰明才力、來爲社會國家担當大事、以上是講鍜鍊一體魄以最好的方法、武藝不僅可以鍛鍊一體魄、實爲保國衛民不可少的本領、現在不僅文人不懂武藝、老實講一句、就是一般武人也不懂武藝、雖然戴了軍帽、穿了軍服、形式上好像是一個軍人、但是不僅不懂文事、連對於武藝的道理、都不明白、在外國人看來、都是不三不四·不文不武·不死不活·的半死人、我所謂「武藝」、是什麽呢、不僅是指打槍放砲等技術、而最重要的尤在運用武藝的精神、卽古人所謂智·信·仁·勇·嚴·之武德、我們做了一個武人、必須「機智」「信義」·「仁愛」·「勇敢」·「嚴重」·五者兼備、才算一個眞正的武人、如果只知道一點打槍放砲等技術、而沒有武德、這只是野蠻、不能算懂武藝、這種人就是禍國殃民的假武人、我們戴了軍帽、穿了軍服、做了一個武人、單是知道用武術、能夠作戰、絕對不夠、一定要具備武德、盡到保國衛民的天職、這樣才能成一個眞正的武人、也這是眞正的完人、一般國民、對於這種武人、正愛戴之不暇、絕對不會存一點厭惡的心思、現在一般國民、爲什麽厭視我們軍人呢、就是因爲一般軍人、雖然戴了軍帽、穿了軍服、而不知武德、不知道爲國爲民盡到軍人的責任、完全是假的武人、不是眞武人、何以我們國家如此缺乏眞武人呢、就是因爲過去一般負軍事教育責任的人、不懂得做武人的道理、所以不能教好一般學生或部下、一般學生、自考進陸軍學校到果業爲止、一般軍隊、自入伍訓練到能夠作戰爲止、都只教他一點武術、沒有同時講究武德、將全般武藝傳授給他們、因此他們就不能發揚軍人的眞精神、造成軍人的眞力量、來保國衛民、以致國家弄到如此危急存亡的地步、所以我們要在宇宙做成正正堂堂的軍人、就非先具備武德不可、所以希望各界領袖、無論教子弟·教學生·或是教部下、都應當注意道一點、要使他們做成現代的國民、必須具備武藝、要具備武藝、必先具備武德、如果大家能夠發揚武德、增進武藝、則國家民族、未有不能轉弱爲強、轉危爲安的再次、要講到教育的主要內容、古人教育學生、有所謂禮·樂·射·御。書。數·六藝、由此可見我們中國古代的教育、本來是文武合一術德兼修的、現在一般人以爲文學校、只講文事、不講武藝、這完全是錯誤了、今後學校教育、還是要根據古人「文武合一」的精神·與「六藝兼修」的原則來辦、不過教育內容、更要充實進步而已、因爲古人所講的六藝、實在是現代國民所必須具備的基本修養和技能、在學生士兵入校或入伍之初、就要拿這些科目來教他們、這些科目、任何人都能學會的、所謂「禮」乃是統括持躬接物一切合理的態度與規矩而言并不是依狹義解釋專指鞠躬舉手這些儀節、這些普通的儀節、只能算是小禮、我們所謂要做到無論飲食起居言語舉比、無時無地不是有規矩守秩序、每天二十四小時的生活、無不在禮之中、如果我們有一時一刻不守禮、家庭學校軍隊乃至社會國家、就要亂起來、所以古人說「禮者事之治也」、又說、「禮所以立」、由此可見禮之重要了、現在一般人不明這個重要的道理、以爲講禮教、是封建制度的遺留、是不適合現時代東西、那曉得禮是立身處世的根本條件、無論古今中外、實不可以須臾離、如果學校教師或軍隊官長、不以禮教育自己學生或部下、他們便要爲一個無禮亂法的人、不僅本身不能成材做人、而且社會國家遝要受他們的禍害、大家要曉得、一個人以至一個國家文野的標準、就是看他的國民循禮的程度如何、守法的精神如何、現在外國罵我們不是現代國家、就是說我們　一般國民不重禮、不守法、無秩序、無組織、其實只要我們負教育責任的人、能夠以身作則、注意教育、禮是人能知人人易行的一回事、例如學生初進學校、就教他在學校裏對先生要尊敬、對同學要和愛、在家庭裏對父母要孝敬、對兄弟姊妹要親愛、在社會上、無論到那裏要敬長上、愛同胞、有禮節、守秩序、這些事他們未有不懂、懂了未有做不到的、我們無論教學生、教士兵、一定要將最緊要而且最易知易行的道理先來教訓他們、現在所講的「禮」字、就是最緊要而且易知易行的道理、大家能夠以禮爲教、就可以使一切受教的人成功正正堂堂的現代國民、所謂「樂」、就是音樂、好的音樂、可以陶冶性情、振作精神、慰藉勞苦、和樂心志、使人生活調暢、情趣優美、無形中養成個人的人格、與社會純正的風俗、其重要不特關係個人德性的修養、且可影響於社會國家之興替、一個人如果沒有音樂的修養、其生活往往很容易失之枯燥、流於偏激、而威不安、變亂或竟由此以生、反之、如果我們有音樂的修養、在煩悶的時候、便可以得到安慰、在嘈雜紛擾的時候、就可以轉爲安定肅穆、悲哀的人、可使轉爲歡樂、狂暴的人、可使變爲溫和、沉悶的人、可使忽然興奮、由此可見樂的功用、非常重大、如果一個人不懂音樂、就不知喜怒哀樂之節、不能實現完美人生、如果一個學校軍隊或一個社會國家沒有樂、亦不成其爲完善學校軍隊或社會國家、尤其軍隊對於音樂、最爲重要、我們平時要和洽軍心、整齊步伍、團結精神、在戰時要慰籍疲困、激勵士氣、振作軍威、都有賴於軍樂、我在江西剿匪的時候、編了一個剿匪要訣歌、這個歌便發生了很大的效力、所以你們一般高級將領、對於軍樂軍歌、務必特別注意、大概音樂第一個要件、是要求和諧、節調的高低、輕重長短、總要整齊劃」、合乎音律和節奏、才能發揮音樂的作用、今天各位唱黨歌音調、就不和諧、大家都是各界領袖、尚如此唱得前前後後高高低低參差不齊、實在是一伴不應該的事情、今後大家要注意改進、并且要教好一般學生部下都懂音樂、將來才能夠成爲全才、我們人類、個個都有音樂的天才、就是三歲小孩、我們教他唱歌、他就會唱、所以任何人都會的、現在我們社會上太不注意音樂、學校裏除了音樂專科以外、一般師生、也都不注意、我們現在旣然明白音樂對於人心風習、對於社會國家、有如此重大的關係、今後就不可不極力的提倡、所謂「射」、在古時就是射箭、是個個人所要學習的武藝、而且時常還要舉行盛大的射禮、舉行射禮的時候、那個人能夠射中靶子、是非常榮耀的一伴事情、古人所謂「君子無所爭、必也射乎、揖讓而升、下而飲、其爭也君子」、由此可見古人對於射的重視、而射的精義、亦可於此略見其一二了、其所謂射、是指射箭、到現在槍砲發明、射字又指射擊而言、這種技術的修養、關係於民德民智與社會國家之興衰很重要、現在外國各地、都有射擊、無論家庭學校軍隊、以及各種機關裏面的人、都參加這種組織、無論男男女女、都能射擊、反觀我們一般國民、不僅不會射擊、連看都未有看過、處在現代世界上、國民對於這種重要的修養、尙如此欠缺、試問如何可以做現代的國民、不被人家侵略壓迫嗎、所以大家要知道射擊之重要、必極力提倡起來、使各地都能夠組織射擊會、使一般國民個個人都能夠精習射擊的技藝、以爲保國衛民之甩、所謂「御」、便是講騎馬駕車、現在許多人、以爲這是一種很卑賤的事情、那曉得這也是從前古人很講求的一種技能、例如孔子的門生、常常替長者執鞭駕車、我國古時一般子弟、很多替他們的父母師長駕車、無論文人武人、都會騎馬習武、現在大家都不做這些事情了、並且提都提不到、不特不替父母和長者駕車、有許多子弟出外讀書、還要父兄替他挑行李、這還算是有禮的人嗎、現在飛機汽車發明、駕飛機汽車、也稱爲御、雖然前後工具與技術、有所不同、而「御」的意義和重要、仍無二致、大家要知道「御」者、駕御控制事物之理、自廣義而言、就可包括人類全部的智能、由狹義而言、專指活動工具的駕駛、亦是現代國民尤其是軍人必要的技能、所以大家不要以爲「御」是卑賤的事情、而要注意以此教育一般學生部下、此外、所謂「書」與「數」兩者、「書」是指關於書寫文學等、「數」是指數學統計測量和其他種種與數學相關的技藝、這是普通一般人都知道要注重的、我現在不必多講、總之、禮·樂·射·御·書·數·六藝、是文武合一的教育之重要內容、也是現代國家所不可或缺的智能、凡是負責教學生部下的人、如果不以此六藝教人、使受教的人成爲人材、使不能算是完全的師資、要爲人師表、就要六藝並重、都有相當的素養、要以六藝的道理、同時傳授於一般受教的人、要按受教者的程度、依六藝並重的原則、授以相當的智能、我們個個人要懂禮樂、要習射御、要通書數、不要視此爲專門的學術技能、要知道六藝乃人人所能知與人人所應習的東西、我們今後要使一般學生部下、能夠成爲健全的人材、建設起現代的國家、就要實施文武合一·術德兼修·的教育、今天在此的各位同志、都負有教人的責任、所以我今天特別將教人的道理、吿訴大家、從此以後、大家應當知道我們要能教導一般學生部下、乃至一般國民、都能成材、第一、先使其與自然界鬥爭鍜鍊他們的體魄、第二、要教以智。信。仁·勇·嚴·之武德、第三、一切教育、要以古人所謂禮樂射御書數六藝爲其主要內容、我所提倡的新生活的根本精神、是禮義廉恥、禮義廉恥就可與智信仁勇餒相通、亦卽六藝之根本精神所在、所以大家要實施文武合一的教育、最切實的一點、就是要努力推行新生活運動、今天我籍此機會、特別將教人的方法、吿訴各位、大家如果能夠照這個意思、力行不懈、不但四川的教育、可收事半功倍之效、四川的社會習風、可以蓬勃向上、而且整個的國家民族的前途、亦必有無限之光明、」（中央社六月二十日）</p>

<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>人各有志，就是：每一個人，有每一個人的「志向。」甲的「志向，」不能強乙同。乙的「志向，」也不能強甲同。譬如，甲的「志向，」是在務農。乙的「志向，」是在做工。如果，呌務農的甲去做工，固然不可以。就是呌做工的乙去務農，也是不可能。</p>
<p>因爲，凡事要就「志向」所近的做起來，纔會感到興趣，能彀感到興趣，纔可以有所成就。否則，如果沒有「志向，」隨便去做，那麼，要想有所成就，這正好比一隻沒有指南針的船，航行於海洋之中一樣！茫無邊際，不知方向的隨處瞎撞，要想達到目的地，是談何容易！</p>
<p>這樣看來，「人貴立志，」確非「瞎三話四。」那麼，請問諸位親愛的小朋友，你們將來的「志向」在那裏？在務農呢？在做工呢？還是在經商呢？要知道，天下之大，事業之多，本不止這農工商三業而已。其它還有許多的事業哩！這全靠要你們立下了「志向」去幹啊！</p>

<p>當天空中有軋軋的機聲震動的時候，你會抬起頭來，看那隻蜻蜓似的飛機，在空中疾馳，我想，飛機誰都知道是在一九〇五年，美人萊脫阿韋爾和萊脫韋伯爾兄弟二人所發明的。但是飛機上的發動機是誰發明的？就是這位卡奇司、小朋友或許知道的很少吧！現在介紹一些他的小史在下面：</p>
<p>公元一八七八年五月二十一日，卡奇司生在紐約的小村中，這村子是四面環山丘，出入必須繞道，所以行走不便。他少時見到這個情形，便想有一輛自行車乘着往來，那是何等便利，又多麽省力！於是將積下的錢，買了一輛自行車。後來他又不滿足，想在自行車上裝了發動機，那是更要快萬倍了。因此找了關於發動機的原理和構造的書籍，加以研讀，幾次失敗才得成功比普通的車子，要快好多倍，然他仍舊努力改良</p>
<p>卡奇司的福運來了。——一九〇七年，美國佛魯理達三十舉行全美自行車的競技會，他便去參加，結果獲得第一，從此全美都知道了。隨後更大的福運又來了。這時發明電話的倍爾，正在做美國航空恊會的總裁，他知道卡奇司的發動機精良無比，便親自拜望卡奇司，請他加入航空恊曾，又請他把自己發明的發動機，做成精良的飛機，得此機會，使美航空界一日千里，有無限的進展。</p>

<p>— 陳治</p>
<p>小朋力，你們看見過金魚嗎，它的渾圓的身子，鮮紅的鱗片，凸出的大眼，蓬鬆的尾巴，是多麼的美麗呀！假如你們歡喜的話，可以利用蠟燭油做成和眞的一模一樣的金魚來玩玩。下面就是做金魚的方法：</p>
<p>把紅白兩種蠟燭油拌和，做成背部紅色腹部淡紅色的金魚模型。在腹部黏上些鐵屑，分量要適當，不可多也不可少，以在水中的任何位置都能靜止爲合度。鐵屑上面再蓋上一層蠟燭油，使看不出鐵屑來。這樣，活動的金魚就做成啦</p>
<p>玩時，把金魚放在盛水的玻璃杯裏，另外拿一塊磁石在杯外上下左右慢慢移動，金魚就會跟著磁石在杯內往來沉浮，粗看起來，活像一條眞的金魚。</p>
<p>小朋友，你們覺得奇怪嗎？爲什麽金魚的身子能豎直？爲什麽金魚會跟着磁石往來沉浮？這個道理是很容易明白的，因爲金魚的腹部黏着鐵屑，它的重心，就在腹部，身子便能豎直；並且磁石有吸引鐵屑的能力，所以磁石在杯外移動，金魚就在杯內游行。</p>

<p>— 公超</p>
<p>在海洋裏，有一種飛魚，它能夠跳出海面，一直飛到五百呎之遠。原來它的胸鰭特別長，長得好像鳥的雙翼一樣。當它一跳出水面，就張開邊兩個胸鰭，飛得和輪船一樣快</p>
<p>它是非常不幸的：在海裏，有貪食的騐和海豚要吃它，它被它們追遂的時候，就逃到空中，但是空中的信天翁和別的鳥正張開饞嘴，一見它從水裏逃出，就拚命地追它，因此，它是常常在兩種敵人的夾攻之中而逃着命的。</p>
<p>這飛魚是一種銀色的大眼睛的東西。</p>
<p>剛剛相反，在鳥類裏，却有不會飛而會游水的東西，其中的一種就是企鵝。企鵝產於南冰洋，它的翼變成鰭狀，所以能夠在水中游泳。游水的時候，用這鰭狀的翼劃水，在水裏忽上忽卜，初看時眞不知道它是魚呢，還是鳥。它的頭和背脊是黑的，肚皮是白的，脚短。</p>
<p>它常常直立着，好像企望着什麽東西似的，所以呌做企鵝。</p>
<p>看了上面這兩個例子，我們可以明白動物爲了適應環境起見，能够把自己身體的一部分，慢慢地變成更有用的樣子，以求滴宜於生存的。</p>
<h3 id="c211">鉛筆 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— 真</p>
<p>「哥哥，鉛筆裏的黑炭條，是不是用鉛質做的？」祥兒顯出一些懷疑的樣子，同時手裏拿着一枝鉛筆。</p>
<p>「你弄錯了，我們把它時做鉛筆，其實裏面不是鉛質，是一種石墨造成的東西。」吉兒是笑嘻嘻地這樣的回答。</p>
<p>「旣然裏面是石墨造成的東西，我們爲什麽不呌它石墨筆，而偏偏要時它鉛筆呢？」</p>
<p>「一般人以爲石墨很像鉛質，所以呌它鉛筆，並且鉛筆比石墨筆容易呌。」</p>
<p>「哥哥，那麽鉛筆是怎樣製造的？你可能吿訴我？」</p>
<p>「鉛筆的製造（一）把石墨研成粉末，然後用泥和水混合起來。（二）把這石墨的混合物，壓成粉團，再經過榨機裏的長管，便成一條細長形的條子。那時還沒有木片。（三）鉛筆的木條，大都是柏樹，因爲這種樹，條紋直，質地軟，容易割削，先把它截成木段，然後用機器把它切成長短一律的小方形的木條。（四）木條經了切過後，同時上面刻有一條凹槽。先把石墨塗上一層膠水，對這凹槽裏一根一根嵌了進去，才會粘牢。然後再把另外一塊木條合上去，便成了一根方鉛筆。（五）把它放在削圓形機器上去，便成一根長的圓鉛筆了。（六）塗漆相磨擦，使外貌美觀，染好之後，等它乾燥，再放在機器裏，做成適當的長短。於是再刻印鉛筆的文字。弟弟，你瞧！一枝鉛筆必須經過這樣繁雜的手續。你下次用起鉛筆來，須得節省一些呀！」</p>

<p>弟弟對姐姐說：「這幾天，因爲要開運動會，我們的學校裏，天天學體操。我們的團體操，已練熟好幾種，排起隊來，是非常的整齊可觀的。」</p>
<p>姐姐道：「這算什麽希奇哩我能夠請數目字排隊哩！」你不相信，你叫拿鉛筆和紙來。」</p>
<p>弟弟飛也似的跑去，飛也似的拿了鉛筆和紙跑回來，對姐姐道：「請你快點說來，怎樣可使數目字排隊？」</p>
<p>姐姐道：「你用三十七，去乘三，用三十七去乘六，去乘九，數目字都會排隊的。」</p>
<p>弟弟依了姐姐的話，就這樣的乘起來</p>
<p>弟弟乘好之後，看了一看，不覺快活起來道：「姐姐！你的話眞不錯，乘出來的數目字，眞是排着整齊的隊伍哩！」</p>
<p>姐姐道：「不但1，2，3，三個數字會排隊，其他4，5，6，7，8，9，都一樣會排隊的。」</p>
<p>弟弟忙着要求姐姐說出來，姐姐就說道：「仍舊都用三十七去乘好了。你記住：用三十七去乘十二，十五，十八，二十一，二十四，二十七。你只要不乘錯，它們就都會排出整齊的隊伍來。」</p>
<p>弟弟就照着姐姐所說的數目，一一去乘，乘下來這個樣子：</p>
<p>弟弟乘好一看，忍不住拍手大喜道：這種算術遊戲，實在巧妙極了！」</p>

<h3 id="c215">關於「大海捕魚」的話 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 吳淞水產學校漁人</p>
<p>五月十　日，我在春秋見兒童週刋裹讀到「大海捕魚」一篇文字，作者把水產常識傳佈到兒童陣中去，這當然是值得我們佩服的，不過在那篇文字的附圖中所繪之事物與實物不無稍有出人，就我所知的把它改正一下子，也許是提倡水產教育的原文作者所樂聞的吧？</p>
<p>在原圖中我們看到一隻漁輪拖着網在前進着，另有一口網張在海中。這兩樣東西都有錯誤</p>
<p>第一，先講漁輪拖綱的錯誤：漁輪拖網分兩種，就是：拖綱漁輪和乎操綱漁輪，能者用　只船拖一隻綱，後者用兩只船拖一隻綱（船和網的構造當然是各別的）。原圖上是一隻拖網漁輪，祗是曳綱和網有些錯誤：曳綱有兩根，每根通長一百二十尋，綱的直徑一吋，由六股網絲繩所絞成。曳網的一頭繫在船面上的曳綱車上（分左右二曳網車），另外一頭則繫在網口的網板上。捕魚開始時將網同鎖於曳綱東鎖，由二網所成之角度可知番網口張開之大小，所以若是要網口張大，祇要把角度放大，要網口收小，祇須把綱所成之角度收小罷了！輪船拖網作業時間每次約三小時，普通一畫夜祇可採捕六七次；每次航海出漁約需十餘日。</p>
<p>第二，再講那口張在海中的網，那種網就是所謂刺網，像捕躋魚（有子的叫做拷子魚）的網也是其中的一種。網上除網身，浮子之外，還有沉子和浮標簡，因爲有了浮子和沉子，網身上面被浮子浮向上去，下而被沉子沉向下去，這樣子一上一下網就張了開來。另外再用浮標筒繫於網的一頭，捕魚船大都是帆船。</p>
<p>以上不過就原圖的錯誤點改正了一下。不過各位小朋友也許還不明白，因此我想到最好請您們的老師領着到漁輪，漁船，水產試騐塲或是水產學校裏去參觀一下，那末要比書上，文字上所見聞到的常識更確實而多了！</p>

<h3 id="c217">中國婦女運動的檢討 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 羅瓊</p>
<p>兼論王教英先生「寄給「婦女青年」主筆釋因」</p>
<p>王孝英先生曾於本刊六十八期發裏了「寄給」婦女靑年「主筆釋因」的一封信，內容是討論中國婦女運動存在的理由及其意義。在「烏烟瘴氣」的現階段中國婦女運動中，對這個問題的重新估量，實大有其必要。這裏除掉敬佩王先生對婦運注意之外，筆者亦不敢藏拙，擬追隨王先生之後，遵循「我們婦女們似乎應該有注意這封信的責任」的指示，略陳愚見，敬質於王先生：</p>
<p>（一）現階段中國婦女運動的分析：</p>
<p>在現階段中國婦運動中，最普通流行的主張大概有下列兩種。。</p>
<p>（甲）取消婦女運動，在這裏又流行着三種不同的意見。首先像釋因先生所謂：</p>
<p>「男女根本不能獨立分離，爲什麽「婦女運動」要單獨成一個名詞呢，儼然有他獨立可做的事業呢？很淺顯的，女子有「婦女會」我們視爲當然不足怪，若果男子亦同樣的有「男子會」不是滑稽可笑嗎？我想這是所謂「婦女運動」的根本錯誤，要把男女分成兩個階級來對抗。至於「女權運動」以「權」字引人爭奪自然更無足取」（婦女靑年一四一期）</p>
<p>這種意見，倒不是由於目前『中國「婦女運動」不澈底或有名無實』而發生的「誤解」，顯然是由於釋因先生對社會問題認識不足，乃至有意蒙蔽社會問題而產生的曲解。無可否認的，在現社會上，男女地位有其一般的共同點；同時誰都會承認，雖然婦女們已經獲得了空洞的「男女平等」的原則，但就實際而論，無論在政治上社會上經濟上，男女地位的不平等，依然存在。這裏當然不能把「男女分成兩個階級來對抗」，但只要「不平等」的一個特殊事實存在時，釋因先生就不能這樣溶解特殊於一般之間，而否認婦女運動有其存在的必要。至於「婦女運動」是否應採取「女權運動」的方式，容於下節討論。</p>
<p>第二種意見，以爲從五四高唱婦運到現在，其結果只是爲學校添了「校花」爲機關添了「花瓶」並且以爲這種結果，完全是婦運的產物，而就肆意高叫婦運取消。這種企圖，倘然不是有意使「女子永遠隸屬於男子」，就是「因噎廢食」。筆者以為才去婦運所以獲得如此結果，原因不在婦運本身，而在整個社會問題未能適當解决。這種事實並未證明婦運不能存在，而只證明婦女問題不能離開整個社會問題而單獨解决。這樣看來，現階段的婦女解放以後，所以墮落腐化，完全由於想在現狀之下求出路的結果。所以假使前一主張是用一般抹煞特殊，那末這一主張就是想用特殊抹煞一般本身：等到特殊本身不能解决問題時候，就連特殊本身也被抹煞。</p>
<p>第三種意見，更是「直捷爽快」，並不像上述兩種那樣，掩蔽在某種面具之下，完成其「婦女回家」的企圖；而是明目張胆的拿出「賢妻良母」的旗幟，喝令「婦女回家」，或是用「婦女問題的解决，在於家庭幸福的獲得，如果在家庭中能夠明白道德上的責任，明白諒解，忍耐，平心靜氣，自然會得到幸福了。」這樣「和顏悅色」的話來麻醉婦女，使她們「心願意服」地去做家奴。道一類人表面上倒也掛着婦運的照牌，但其取消婦運，出賣婦女利益，已屬有目共睹，不用再加批評；上述三種主張，不論是直接地或間接地取消婦運，總之是用復古的手段，來麻醉靑年婦女前進的意識，都企圖犧牲婦女，暫時緩和現在經濟的政治的危機。</p>
<p>（乙）承認婦女運動有存在的必要，同時以爲中國現階段的婦運，還停滯在「女權運動」這一時期。王先生就是這種主張的堅持者。在她給釋因先生信中，曾說「你說「女權運動」以「權」字引人於爭奪，是不應該的。這話表面上看來，彷彿是對的；但是現在男子剝奪女子的權利自由，我們似乎不應該抱着不抵抗主義，而使女子屈服於男子鐵蹄之下，任其宰割」。從這幾句話中，顯然可以領略王先生是抱着「挪拉的勇氣」，從五四到現在，本着一貫的主張，百拆不回地想澈底地完成男女「平等的原則」。其奮鬥的精神，固可欽佩；但是一先生在此地已把婦運從整個社會問題中間孤立起來，沒有看到女權遝動的時代背景；因而中國婦女運動應有的發展，亦被疏忽，結果永遠抱着「五四時代」的女權運動，白頭偕老，不知不覺地做了時代的犧牲。</p>
<p>（二）婦女運動的社會背景</p>
<p>根據上面的分析，對於取消婦運的各種意見，此地已母須發述。而對於女權運動，實有詳細檢討，以確定其意義的必要。爲着更明晰地瞭解這「問題起見，筆者擬分三點敘述：一·婦女運動的發生，二·女權運動的時代性，三·資本主義社會的婦女問題。</p>
<p>根據王先生的意見，婦女運動的發生，亦就是婦女運動存在的理由，是因「男子對於女子……已經成了一個特殊階級」，而婦女運動的目的，就是「要喚醒女子自身的覺悟，和抵抗男性所給與的一切壓迫，她要消除兩性間的階級，而造成男女絕對平等的世界」。這種抽象的觀念，芷像王先生所說的，「表面上看去，彷彿很對，」但一究實際，又覺似是而非。一切社會問題的產生，都有一定的經濟機構爲其基礎；同時一切社會問題的解决，也要在經濟發展的一定階段，即在經濟發展容許着的限度以內，才有可能。在歷史上，自從男女平等的黃金時代——原始民挨公社崩潰以後，女子不得參加社會的生產勞動，而被限制於家庭以內，男子靠着自已的私有財產權，強迫女子隸屬於自己權威之下。因此婦女在政治上經濟上社會上都同男子不能平等。此種情形到封建時代，更是登峯造極」。倘使依照王先生的說法，這時婦女一定要起來「抵抗男性所給與的一切壓迫」。可是事實並不這樣；那時顯然沒有什麼婦女運動，有的只是「三從四德」等類騙人的禮教。誰都不能否認，婦女運動乃是資本主義發展中的特殊產物。爲什麼這時才有婦女運動產生？或許有人以爲由於這時有了「先知先覺」起來「喚醒婦女自身的覺悟」。就算這是對的話；我們還要追問這些「先知先覺」，爲什麽不降生於奴隸社會及封建社會，而獨降生於資本主義社會？或者爲什麼她們在奴隸社會及封建社會必被當作叛逆而受嚴刑峻罰，但到資本主義社會就會受人稱頌，甚至可厠身於男子之林而「爲官就職」等等？</p>
<p>原來在產業革命以後，資本主義大規模的發展，自由勞動者的需要亦愈急切。首先是通過了「農奴解放」而消滅多數男子出賣勞動力的束縛。更進一步，數千年來被監禁在家內的囚徒——婦女，不因資本主義的繼續發展，而有大批的把她們逐出家庭，拖入工廠去的必要。分工的進步和機器的採用，漸使婦女勞動已有普遍採用的可能：同時女工工資的低廉，更迎合着廠主們的貪慾。但封建道德的重重束縛，阻滯「婦女離家」運動的進行；婦女問題就是這樣矛盾中的產物而女樣運動也就爲解决這矛盾而獲得其存在的條件。</p>
<p>例如法國大革命時期的婦女運動，是因爲在十五世紀到十八世紀時，同業公會的嚴格規定，將婦女職業的領城，束縛得非常狹小，生產運動領域，完全爲男子所佔有：於是勞苦婦女們要求「在勞動上與男子享同等權利」，換句話說，就是「勞動的絕對自由」。她們亦很淸楚地知道，要「勞動自由，根本須廢棄封建制度，破壞同業工會組織。爲了達到這種目的，她們也會打著自由平等的旗幟，熱烈地參加黨時資產屆的民主革命。</p>
<p>隨着資本主義的發展，各國女權運動，相繼獲得或多或少的成功；男女平等的原則至少在理論上已被承認。不過女權運動雖得相當成功，婦汝問題顯然仍未澈底解決。因婦女脫離了封建束縛，又受資本束縛，她們解放以後，仍不能做一個理想中的健全女子，甚至迫得去做「花瓶」「舞星」等等。在資本主義社會內所能政權，本來不過是爲保障特殊地位的利益而設的：因此婦女在女權運動之中所得的權利，自然亦不能夠超過一般之上。並且由於種種傳統關係（主要的如財產權等一般仍被男子所壟斷）一婦女無論在政治上經濟上文化上，一般都比男子驟然落後；工作範圍遠比男子來得狹小，而且所受待遇也不如男子。所以在資本主義社會中，婦女們一方面部份地脫離了家庭束縛，參加社會生產工作，而受資本家的掠奪；另一方面又或多或少地受封建殘餘的影響，仍然困頓在男子們的支配之下。在這兩重束縛之中，產生了現階段的婦女問題。因此這問題的解决，當然已不是前一階段的反封建的女權運動所能完成。只有與這孕育婦女問題的整個社會關係聯繫起來，纔能獲得澈底解决現階段的婦女問題的鎖鍮。</p>
<p>（三）中國的社會變遷與婦女問題</p>
<p>歸女運動之史的發展，特別是女權運動的時代性，旣然明晰以後，這裏再來觀察現階段中國婦女問題的核心及其辨决。爲求正確隙解這點，必須先來分析中國社會變遷，而後及於問題的本身。</p>
<p>自從鴉片戰爭以後，資本主義的萌芽開始在中國成長起來，與這緊隨着的婦女解放運動，亦漸見其端倪。世界大戰時期，列強經濟侵略，暫時緩和，於是中國民族工業飛運的發展。這時新興資產份子反抗封建勢力乃至解除列強經濟束縛的要求日益監強；同時男女平等的思想也就彌漫全國。轟轟烈烈的五四運動，就是這種社會變化的產物。跟着五四運動的相當成功，尤共是此後的五卅及十六年的國民革命，女子在教育上職業上婚姻上的禁錮，漸被開放，女子參政樣及遺產權也被法律所承認。中國的女權運動，於此已吿一結束。</p>
<p>自然，中國的女權運動，非但不能超過各國的一般的成就，甚至更在一般以下。因爲中國是個半殖民地國家：列強的經濟侵略，使中國民族資本的發展特別困難，因它的反封建的任務也不能夠澈底完成，，與此相應中國婦女所受的封建束縛，實際上是遠過於英美各國。另一方面，在這外國資本的支配之下，中國的民族資本極難發展因此他們不得不用更落後更利害的手段來對付勞動婦女，王先生說「現在中國政治的中心是男子，社會的中心是男子」，至於家庭的中心呢？同時指出政治上經濟上社會上種種不平等的事實，這些固然不錯；相是這種現象，我們已經不能單純地婦結到女權運動的尚未成功，也决不是靠着女權運動所能解决。前汞里述婦女解放以後去做「花瓶　舞星」尤其是工廠婦女和農村婦女在這都由蕭條農村破綻，中，所忍受的種種非人生活，都不是參政權，「遣產承繼權以及一切「自由平等」等類別號所能解决。女權運動的不能解决中國現階段婦女問題已是明若觀火。</p>
<p>綜上所述，我們知道中國婦女問題也同其它各國一樣，是以一般社會問題爲其基礎，同時在這一般之中，婦女問題的有它特殊的意義，仍然可以成爲一個獨立的婦女解放運動，不過婦女問題旣以整個社會問題爲其基礎，那末婦女問題自然亦不能脫離了整個社會問題而單獨解决，在這世界資本主義沒落時期，尤其這半殖民地的中國，要想單獨靠女權運動「本着（男女）平等的原則，來共同發展其知識能力，造成一種美滿自由的家庭和社會」，恐怕只是一種超現實的幻想。王先生不以個人成就爲滿足，仍然大聲疾呼「爲二萬萬可憐的女子痛哭」，這種精神，至可欽佩；但是時至今日，再來提倡狹隘的女權運動，就算不是有意掩飾更重要的社會矛盾，恐怕仍不免於徒勞無功。古話說得好：「愚者千慮，必有一得」，不知道王先生是否願意接受這點或許可以稱爲「一　得』的「愚見」？</p>

<p>— 高鴻壽</p>
<p>笑因君在「寄給婦女靑年主筆釋因」的一封信中（見六月九日申報婦女園地），因釋因君曾說：「女權運動以權字引人於爭奪，自然更無足取」一言，引起她的一番異議說：「男子剝奪女子的權利自由，我們似乎不應也抱着不抵抗主義，使四萬萬女子，屈服於男子鐵蹄之下，任其宰割吧！」，原因是她看見到現在中國政洽社會和家庭的中心都是男子，可是她所見的未免偏窄了。</p>
<p>姑論由男女兩性—一夫一妻—共同組織而成的家庭，不論是夫是妻，都可以指這兩人合創的家庭，抽人說是他或她的家庭，可是却因一個家庭，往往祇由男子一人在外工作，把所換得的錢，供給整個家庭的消費，（特殊情形在外），所以男子便取得家庭的中心，這是先據事實而後定各僩人的身份，何嘗是男子霜佔了各方的中心？分明是女子自己無能而放棄的，不單是中國，各國也都是這樣。</p>
<p>再則我們都知這：「能者用而智者謀；勞力者役於人而勞心者役人；」的常理，所以除非智識的不同，分出尊卑的地位，此外誰也不能支配他人，因此我認爲笑因君所說「男子對於女子呢；他已經成了一個特殊的階級—婦女運動就是要消除男女間的階級—他是處於支配女性的地位，他對於女性的權威，已經達於極點」的話，是不確實的。</p>
<p>笑因君似乎可以不必民法親屬篇裏摘錄出：「女子結婚以後，應從夫姓，以夫之住所爲住所，所生兒女，應從父姓……」等，作爲有力的例證—賽是丈夫的所有物，她所操理的是丈夫的家庭：她所撫育是丈夫的兒女—女子一切的活動，都離不開男性支配，她的生活與農家所養蓄的牛馬相同，其實妻從夫姓，因爲夫是代表家庭和外界交接的機會較多關係，用以使外界認識統一而已；所謂夫之住所，實就是與妻共同組織的家庭，所以妻住的是自己的住所；妻所操理的是自已的家庭；二點俱無爭的必要</p>
<p>至於所生的兒女，亦從父姓，此節不過是依附妻從夫姓而產生，但是萬一兒女可以不從父姓而從母姓，於理男女仍不能絕對平等，所以最好合父母兩姓爲姓，倘而實行，傳到孫子一代，就要有四個字爲姓了至於撫育兒女爲夫的處於被生理限止的情形之下，當然由妻負擔，不過要明白，所生的兒女，是夫和妻二人共有的結晶品，所撫育的並非是夫一人的兒女，總之，一切的一切，是夫和妻本着互助的精神，取各人特長的能耐，而自願盡的義務，斷無男子支配女子做牛馬般勞作的道理。</p>
<p>經濟方面，笑因君也把民法親屬編裏所說：「由妻之原有財產所生孳息，共所有樣歸屬於夫，夫對於妻原有財產有使用牧益之權……」等，認爲是男子經濟侵略的例證，此點男子確乎是過分之處，我希望能把此點糾正，免得因夫破產面累及妻也破產，可是像現在的女子，多數仍不做生產工作，經濟根本沒有來源，倘使祇爲父母或公婆所遺傳的財產，而爭奪產權，那是可醜的一件事</p>
<p>笑因君又說：「男子除了用政治經濟的侵略以外，他還要用文化侵略像各地紛紛主張良女賢母教育，…」可是倘不如此，爲人妻而不良；爲人母而一不賢；怎能符合男女平等原則，而造成美滿的家庭呢？所以說到這一層，不是男子施的信略政策，祗有質問男子，不應該使女子單獨進行，同時也該主張良夫賢父教育，並無侵略可言，基七理由，女子確仍有其掙扎可能，可惜大多數自己不肯掙扎，和掙扎不得其所響</p>
<p>末了，當我讀完笑因君的全文後，認爲她多少是一位比較達觀的女子，却希望她多多喚起女子，從事生產工作，替女子樹立較好的地位，不要再在言語間，作浮泛的爭奪女權運動吧。</p>

<h3 id="c221">「小農戶聯合生產」救農村 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 郭鏡</p>
<p>全國百分之八十的農民是我們民族的生命，全國一百萬個農村是我們民族的靈魂，然而試一考今日的所謂民族的生命，實已只剩最後的一息，所謂民族的靈魂，也已趨向於死滅的危途。農邨破產，呌得震天價響了，可至今還沒有一個眞正能拯民於水火的辦法，給事實得一些裨益。</p>
<p>今日農民生活困苦的造因，實非常錯綜複雜，如土地分配的不均，社會制度的不良，帝國主義經濟勢力之巨掌的伸入，皆爲原因之一，但農業生產技術的落後，尤爲促使農民生活瀕於死亡線的最大原因。故我人在今日與其高唱什麽什麽救國而徒成畫餅，母寗先從如何改良生產技術增加生產效率下手，為創傷中的農民找一條生存之路，使崩潰中的農邨見」條光明的大道，較爲得計。</p>
<p>那末，如何改良生產技術，如何增加生產效率呢？我以爲最好的辦法是「小農戶聯合生產」。</p>
<p>向來，農民被决於智識的囿限，保守的惰性，自利的私心，加以缺乏指導援助，故農民只會墨守成法，不知新式生產技術爲何物，自然更不知道聯合生產的便利，經濟及其效能如何了。他們各別經營自己農田的結果，不但浪費了勞力，浪費了金錢，而且還得到一個不能維持生活的痛苦結局。</p>
<p>有人調查江南某縣普通農家的收入：</p>
<p>計耕田十畝。夏作稻平均每畝收一石半，平均每石八元，計得一百二十元：冬作麥平均每畝收八斗，平均每石六元，計得四十八元：稻麥桿計得二元：共計收入一百七十元。除去每畝肥料三元，收支相抵，實得一百四十元。另加蔬菜畜牧養蠶共收五十四元，其他副業共收四十元。總計全年收入二百三十四元。</p>
<p>又根據顧復先生統計，凡老幼合計五口之家，每年的生活費支出：</p>
<p>（一）飲食費米麥每日三角，每月九元，全年一百零八元，蔬菜肉類每日一角，全年三十六元，薪炭鹽醬每年三十六元；（二）衣服費每人每年四元，計二十元；（三）房屋修理或房租全年十二元；（四）教育費全年六元；（五）親友婚喪應酬每年十元；（六）醫藥每年十元：（七）婚喪費十元（平均十年一次，每次百元，每年攤十元）；（八）賦稅六元；（九）雜費二十元：總計全年支出二百七十四元。</p>
<p>根據上列統計，這樣一個農家每年至少尚有四十元沒有着落。並且，我們還要認淸，這裏所指的還是士地肥沃的地方，年成還是平常的時候，若士味瘠薄，或遇水旱虫災，那他們的生計更可想而知了。</p>
<p>所以我們若要解救農民的痛苦，謀全民族的繁榮，非趕快打算有效的增加生產方法不可，非趕快在聯合生產的旗幟之下共同努力不可。</p>
<p>語有云：「衆擎易舉，孤掌難鳴」，又謂：「衆志成城，力薄難勝」，凡事如此，農業尤甚。以往我國農民，因爲個別經營農業，一切農具，都須自備，所以，如果要採用新式農業機械，在個別的農民就因缺乏資本而無力舉辦，於是生產效果便降低了。如前年江南久旱成災，小河乾涸，因宋能聯合舉辦吸水滂浦，祗得坐待稻田成爲枯搞。此猶如患病的人，因無九延聘醫生診治，終至一命鳴呼，這是何等可憐可嘆的事！平時，多數農民都只能醫得眼前瘡，不想再去改良舊式農具，故每逢天時較旱，全靠人力或畜力去轉動戽水，一般農民往往將長夏消磨於戽水之勞。結果，耗費雖大，而效力却有限，如遇大旱，則效果農等於零！</p>
<p>我人敢鄭重高呼於國人之前曰：我們要救農民生活的困苦，穩定民族的基礎，應該一致主張將一切各別耕種的舊法從速廢棄，聯合起來向「合作生產」的新路上邁進。只有聯合生產才能破滅亞細亞式的生產技術，只有聯合生產才能蓮用科學的生產方式。</p>

<h3 id="c222">即將完成的新加坡軍港 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 華美</p>
<p>馬來半島通訊</p>
<p>新加坡是馬來半島南部的一個小島，在五百年前它還是一個荒涼的漁村；可是，自歐洲勢力侵入以後，在最近百年內，這個荒涼的漁村竟一變而爲世界第九大港。現在了英國正在努力建設新加坡軍港，強化新加坡海軍根據地，大約在本年內卽可完工；據英國的軍事記者推測，在完工之後，新加坡軍港便是世界第四的優秀的作戰根據地了。</p>
<p>遠在一九一九年，吉利可提督巡察東洋之後，卽建議英政府建築新加坡軍</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>港，至一九二三年四月，保守黨內閣乃正式决定，開始進行。但一九二四年麥唐納的工黨內閣成立，在軍縮和極東和平的理由下，又中止了建築新加坡軍港的實施計劃。迨一九二五年保守黨再行登台，於是建築新加坡軍港之議又行複活了。不過，開始積極進行的時間乃是在一九三二年以後，更具體地說。乃是在日本奪取東北事件發生以後。</p>
<p>英國在新加坡建築軍港，最初的　算是一千百萬鎊，後來又減少為七百七十五萬鎊，但去年的豫算又增加爲八百九十三萬鎊了。這個築港的地方，水很深，無風浪，可以容納大批的巨艦。同時，這裏還有大規模的海陸飛機塲各一，計劃至少能容一千架飛機。最近幾年來，英國已化了很多的錢，在這裏完成了防波堤，無綫電，浮船碼頭，儲油棧，以及大規模的陸上要塞。現在，這個巨大的築港工程正在積極進行，原來所雇用的工人只有五千，此刻已增至一萬四五千人了；其中有八千中國人？四千馬來人，二千印度人。爲着「軍事上的秘密」，要塞和軍港地帶是禁止麥觀的，所以我們在這裏所能看到的，只是這些工人成羣地在運輸鐵條鋼柱之類的材料，只是許多「皇家飛機」不時地在天空飛翔，只是大英帝國的陸海空軍的行動，只是通夜照着的探海燈。</p>
<p>新加坡是歐亞航路的中心，是南洋羣島的樞紐，距英國主力艦隊的根據地摩爾遂計六〇〇〇逕，距日本的佐世保只有一六〇〇滙，如果把新加坡與佐權保或長崎的距離和從眞珠軍港到橫濱的距離（三四〇〇浬）相比較，則前者還要近許多。所以，在日本看來，英國之建築新加坡軍港，除了防衛其在太平洋和印度洋上的諸領土外，同時更是在威脅佐世保，台灣，威脅日本。事實上，近年以來，由於日本勢力之積極向中國向南洋發展，英國確是早已大　不安，新加坡軍港的積極建築，確是在企圖維持其者遠東的覇權，同時也是在防衛日本。單以這個建築工作是在東北事件發生之後。才積極開始實行一事來說，也可看出大英帝國的用心如何了。近來聽說東京方面有借欵與暹羅政府在暹羅境內克拉地峽開擊運河的計劃。若這條運河一旦完成，不僅新加坡在商業上的一切價值會被奪去，而且新加坡軍港在軍事上的價值亦將爲之減少了。英國下院保守黨議員對於這件事曾發表了這樣的言論；「暹羅建築運河的計劃，實有討論之必要，因聞係由日本借與經費而從事建築的。這個計劃如果實現，對於我們在馬來半島的軍事要塞將有極大的影響。我們不要忘記巴拿馬運河的開通，在西半球上具有絕大的海軍與軍事的重要性。」由此我們不僅可以見到英人對於共「在馬來半島的軍事要塞」的童視。而且也可以看出英日兩國在遠東的衝突情勢了。</p>
<p>最近以來，日本在新加坡非常活動，同時英國的防範也特別加嚴。所以，這兒在表面上雖很「安靜」，但在實際上却好像太平洋大戰已經爆發了一樣，空氣是非常緊張的。</p>
<p>新加坡其有四五十萬居民，共中三分之二是中國人，但是，這些中國同胞在大英帝國的統治之下，不僅未曾注意到祖國的國難，而且連中國話也不會說了！他們所用的語言，是英語和馬來土話，假使你不懂英語和馬來土話，走到新加坡來時，那你是不能和這兒的中國同胞談話的。</p>

<p>— 沈千里</p>
<p>是一個晴天的下午，我和榮宗敬先生在他的寫字間裏見面了。一位身材矮小，面貌並不驚人，服裝又是那麽樸素的老年人，坐在一張寬大的爲字檯跟前，這呌任何人走進去也不敢相信這就是擁有九個紗廠和八個麫粉廠的「麪粉大王」，無怪我見了他本人，還要問一聲：「榮宗敬先生在這裏麽？」</p>
<p>當我走進這佈置很簡單的寫字間，榮氏便站起身迎着我走了過來。</p>
<p>「有什麼事麼？」他滿臉露着歡悅的笑。</p>
<p>「我特地來拜訪他的，並且想知道他創業的經過情形。」</p>
<p>「啊！」他又笑了一下，帶着滿口的無錫土音說：「我就姓榮呵！」</p>
<p>「唔……失敬得很；因爲平素沒見過，當面都不認得了。」我感到自己的渺小，臉上熱辣辣地，像吃過了辣椒似的。</p>
<p>「隨便坐罷！」他說時在壁上按了一下電鈴。一會兒茶房送了兩杯茶進來·他又和我客氣了一陣。</p>
<p>「不必客氣，」我微微移動了一下身子，說：「榮先生每天都到這裏來辦公吧？」</p>
<p>「每天都來的：我也和他們（指職員們）一樣，早上九點鐘，下午兩點鐘上寫字間，直到上午十二點鐘和下午六點鐘才回去吃兩頓飯。」</p>
<p>「那也很辛苦的。」我說。</p>
<p>「這倒也不覺得，幾十年來都是如此，現在已變成了習慣，倒是整天地登在家裏閒着反而有點過不來了。」</p>
<p>「當然，做這樣大的事業，是籠要耐勞的精神的。對於上海的各廠，榮先生每天也都要去巡視一次麽？」</p>
<p>「不，因爲　邊都有人負責的，所以不必一定要每天都去，而且在時間上也來不及。我設在上海的紗廠和麫粉廠一共有十幾爿，假如每爿廠都去巡視一次？就費一天的工夫也還是不行的。」他不禁自豪地哈哈大笑起來。</p>
<p>「榮先生辦那裏多紗廠，怎麽倒還是以麫粉而出名？」我好奇地問者。</p>
<p>「這也有原因的，多謝他們呌我麫粉大王。」他喝了一口茶，繼續地說：「說起這段歷史來，話就長了。從前我在無錫經營的商業規模很小，可是每年都還賺點錢；不過自已總覺得這種生意雖然賺錢，究竟不是直接有利於民生的事業。後來跑到上海，眼見得外貨大量的輸入，尤其是關乎民衣民食的紗布麫粉佔大多數；而廻顧國內，對於這種工業簡直是無人注意，因此我便東拼西凑地邀集了幾萬元的股本，開始組織了福新麫粉公司。起初祇開辦一個廠。當然囉！那時的規模是非常的幼稚，還談不到和外貨競爭，不過至少在外貨的入超上已經是挽回了一點漏扈。自福新第一廠開辦後，幾年間每年都還有點錢可賺，於是就靠這筆盈餘的利潤，由一廠擴充到二，三，四各廠。不久歐戰爆發，各國的輕重工業都受了戰爭的影響，紛紛宣吿歇業，外貨的輸入也不像先前那麽多了。尤其是麫粉和紗布。因當時要供給軍需，後來不僅沒有剩餘的可運到中國，甚且反而要到中國來購買了。總計在歐戰四年中，福新售出的麫粉竟有九百萬袋之多。那時每袋麫粉的價格，僅較銷售於國內的高出一元。當然，由歐戰的賜予，福新是賺了幾百萬元的錢的，而我的「麫粉大王」的徽號也就從此出名了。可是當時國內紗布的產量却尚不够供給，外貨又沒有多的進來，紗布的價格便一天比一天的高昂起來了，而直接受到這種影響的還是一般穿不起綢緞的平民。在這一年裏，我便倡議開辦申新紗廠，想從這上面來解决當前的困難問題。事情是進行得很順利，在第一年中便成立了七個紗廠。可是到了第二年，因爲所有的資金都集中到紗廠上面，有一個時期竟至缺乏現金週轉，而且負債又是幾百萬；一般旁觀者這時都替我躭着很大的心，恐怕我的事業前途將會遇到不可解救的危險。我自己對這種情形也很明白，不過我一些也不感到慌張；我在這一年中，只是埋頭苦幹，應付這當前的困難環境，果然，在第二年的總結算期間，竟出乎意外的賺了幾百萬元，把所有的負債還淸之後，流動資金也就跟着多起來了。正在這時英商三新紗廠出賣了，我便花了幾百萬元把牠接收過來。現在的申新第九廠，就是從前三新紗廠的化身。不過，我把牠接收過來之後，又用了二百四十多萬元把所有的廠房和工人住宅從新建築了一番。」他說着，喝了口茶，輕輕地呷着舌頭，似乎還有不少的回味。</p>
<p>我像聽故事般地愈聽愈感到興趣，便笑着說：「榮先生不僅是「麫粉大王」，而且還是一個紗業的領袖哩！」</p>
<p>「這倒不敢說，」他搖了搖頭，說；「不過我總想多做點和老百姓直接發生關係的事業；醫如紗布和麪粉我都感到很大的興味，將來如有機會的話，也許還要多做一兩樣與民生經濟更有利的工業呢」</p>
<p>「榮先生現在擁有這麽大的資產，個人的生活方面當然是……」</p>
<p>「個人的生活麼？」他不等我的話說完便哈哈地笑了。「我除了出進比普通人多了一輛汽車，什麼都是和人家一樣。你看，我身上穿的差不多都是本廠的出品，可以說這幾年來就沒有上布店扯過一尺衣料。其餘如買零碎用品，都是家裏辦好的，我自已一年也還用不了十塊錢。」</p>
<p>「聽說還有幾位少君，大概也都受了榮先生的薰陶，生活是很簡樸的吧？」</p>
<p>「共有三個孩子，兩個現在都還管點事，還有一個小的在讀書；他們弟兄都還不亂來。我對於子弟，都不願意他們擺出少爺的架子，因爲目前中國正需要能苦幹的人。我從前開始辦福新廠時不知道遇到過多少困難，可是也沒有、一次不是從容應付過去的；而且一椿事業如不經這幾次的失敗，人們就要把牠看得很平凡，面不背下死功夫去幹了。」</p>

<h3 id="c224">法國民主政治的沒落 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 章普</p>
<p>法國是民主革命最徹底的國家·是近代民主政治的發祥地，因之向來法國都是尊重「人權」「自由」的。大戰以後。法國更借着凡爾賽和約的統制力量，內則因爲得到了許多賠欵和別的利益而使國家經濟和財政比較安定·外則因凡爾賽統制的效能與國聯的作用而使其稱覇歐洲，所以，在戰後德奧等國發生危機時，法國的政局還比較安定，所謂兩極端政治的傾向還未發生。但是，好景未能常存，自一九二九年世界經濟恐慌發生後，資本主義的法蘭西的繁榮竟被這恐慌的潮流所掃蕩。於是，生產過剩，貿易衰落，失業增加，農村恐慌，信用凋疲，銀行倒閉，財政危機等現象，便日益在法國發生並發展起來了。同時，在外交上法國也常常遇到不如意的事情。很顯然的，英國在戰後因爲不願法國獨覇歐洲，便常在各方面與之爲難。如它在暗中扶助德國重整軍備，公然贊成法意海軍平等。反對白里安的多瑙河聯盟計劃，便是顯然的例証。希特勒登台以後，凡爾賽統制更被摧毀。使法蘭西的覇權更見動搖。拿法國與歐洲各國的關係來說，如波蘭本是其最好的興國，但近年來華沙的外交完全與巴黎的意旨相達背，德國和波蘭成立了同盟，在許多地方都是一致的；又如奧匈也是與法國最親近的國家，但因法德衝突的日益尖銳，法國爲要對付德人，便不得不睜着眼睛看到意大利的勢力向中歐發展，把奧匈拉過去了；再如小恊約國，向來是被稱爲法國的衛星的，但近來南斯拉夫與法國的離心力已在日益發展，所謂小協約國的體系，已有逐漸解體的危險，自戈林往遊巴爾幹，與南斯拉夫要好後，這一危險更將有成爲現實的可能；現在，與法國要好的只有蘇聯，但蘇聯是否眞正與法國站在同一戰綫上，還是一個很大的疑問。由此我們可以說近幾年來法國在外交上是失敗的。最近以來，由於德國的重整軍備，東歐公約的難產，英德海軍協定的成立，更使法國在歐陸上的地位大受威脅。在英德海軍恊定成立後，法人蘇爾芝曾著論文說：「三月前德國未得法國之同意，逕自改編其軍隊，並實施徵兵制，此舉使戰勝國及條約之尊嚴受一嚴重打擊；今日德國復獲得英美日三國之同意，重整海軍，使法國更感創鉅痛深！他國漠視法國利益，法國今欲強迫德國接受其意志，時已不及！」這的確是說的老實話。——這樣，法國旣戚於國內經濟恐慌與財政危機，又在外交上迭遭失敗，不必說其政局必然不能安定。如照最近的情形看來，恐怕法國政治將有走上極端的道路之可能，其民主政治的生命將有斷絕的危險。</p>
<p>法國與英美等國的情形不同，它沒有很大的政黨，它是許多小黨並存的國家。以這些小黨的組成份子及其所行的政策來說，可以將它們分成左翼右翼和中翼三大勢力。過去因爲法國社會比較安定，對外又芷需要國際恊調主義，所以比較溫和的代表自由市民的社會急進黨曾歷次組閣。但近年以來，在經濟恐慌，財政危機，外交困難的情況之下。社會念進黨的內閣也不能保存了。首先是赫里歐內閣在戰債問題上倒台，其次是彭古內閣爲預算案而辭職，隨着便是達拉迪，薩勞，旭當等內閣的相繼崩潰。在達拉迪二次祖閣之後，法國右傾各團體便以巴容盧及斯達維斯基案在巴黎舉行暴動，伺時左翼的社會黨等也來了一個反示威，把個素稱安靜的法關西鬧得滿城風雨了，這結果是達拉迪內閣倒台，隨後便出現了政黨休戰與舉國一致的杜美內閣，因爲杜美是比較右傾的人物，所以杜美內閣的組成，不僅是社會急進黨繼續組閣的中斷，而且是法國右傾政治的開始抬頭。</p>
<p>杜美內閣在成立不久之後，因憲政改革案遭到了社會急進黨的反對而崩潰。繼之而起的是佛蘭亭內閣。但最近佛蘭亭內閣又以財政全權案被推倒了。隨着出現的蒲伊松內閣，僅僅存在了三天，在財政全權案上以兩票之差而斷送了壽命。現在，賴伐爾內閣已吿成立，財政全權案也已在參衆兩院通過，在表面上，法國的閣潮雖暫吿平息，但就在最近的過去的閣潮中，也可以看出法國兩極端勢力爭鬥的嚴重局面了。</p>
<p>從杜美內閣到賴伐爾內閣，雖在形式上有些變換，但在實際上可說是法國右傾政治的發展。很顯然的，社美是接近右翼的人物，佛蘭亭更是巴黎事件的指使者，賴代爾乃是佛蘭亭內閣的外長。據巴黎某報所載，賴伐爾政府擬自七月一日起，頒佈國會所授權之代法律命令，其內容如下：（一）削減或取銷若干種恩給金。（二）取銷現任軍職之參戰軍人退職金，（三）取銷次要之鐵道支綫，減用鐵道人員，（四）逐漸裁汰冗員，取銷兼職及若干種公費，取銷額外時間之工作獎金，（五）裁撤若干行政機關，（六）修改社會保險制度。如果這個消息是事實的話，那麽單就這一點我們也可說賴伐爾內閣的右傾表現已比佛蘭亭內閣更進一步了。</p>
<p>現在，由於賴伐爾內閣的財政全權案被通過，法國政局在表面上雖較安定，但其政治危機却正在日益發展着。事實上，帝制派所組織的「法蘭西行動派」已在最近舉行示威運動，搗毀了主張法郎貶價的小日報；退伍軍人所組成的「火十字會」現正在全國遍貼標語，大呌「國庫現已空虛，和平岌岌可危，人民希望工作與麵包，欲圖防止投機之政府，已爲議會於二十四小時內推翻，資本主義奴隸之右翼議員與馬克思奴隸之左翼議員兌正準備內戰，我人主張立卽加以阻止」！前總理泰狄歐也反對議會制度，主張建立強有力的政府以應付今日的「經濟難局」；同時，左翼的社會黨的領袖也明白宣稱彼等能應付一切事變，在左派各黨聯席會議中也已討論了改選國會以期產生多數黨的問題；社會急進黨因見於「火十字會」與「國民志願隊」等的積極活動，在最近的黨團會議上已决定於國會休假期中黨團仍行開會，並要求國會各委員會於假期中亦繼續開會。—形勢的嚴重。於此可見！</p>
<p>在這樣嚴重的形勢中，我們很顯然地可以看出法國兩極端衝突正在發展。這個發展的前途。必然是兩極端之某一方面（左面或右面）的勝利，因爲照目前法國的國內外情勢看來，中間的溫情主義實無勝利的可能。所謂近代的「德謨克拉西政治」在法國恐亦有斷絕生命的危險；而且，這一危險之成爲現實，據目前情形看來，還不能說是在怎樣遙還的時候，說不定就在目前呢！</p>

<h3 id="c225">語文問題一夕談 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 曹菊</p>
<p>甲　前天答應了今晚和你談談語文問題，因爲很忙，沒有好好的準備，頂好你提出問題，我來答覆。</p>
<p>乙　謝謝你，勞你特地跑來。你坐了談吧！我第一要問的是，中文拉丁化的目的是什麼？</p>
<p>甲　它的目的是要　　字運動易於奏效，使只會說話不會看書寫字的文盲大衆得到一種文字。我們知道，中國的象形文字實在太……</p>
<p>乙　太難了，是不是？</p>
<p>甲　對了，太難了。一塊一槐畢起來要好幾年功夫才能識得幾千塊字。要能自由看書作文，大概非十年功夫不行吧。而一般人的生活又不大好，實在沒有時間和經濟條件來學這種文字。這是第一。</p>
<p>乙　第二呢？</p>
<p>甲　漢字的缺點不單在於「難」，而且在於「壞」。漢字不適於普通一般人的使用，它呌人「望文生義」，它不能和口頭語符合，不適宜於阿兒連萬，不</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>能接受國際化的語根。這就是第二點。</p>
<p>乙　你說咱們中國人，把幾千年來的漢字廢掉，倒央學外國人的鬼子話不成？</p>
<p>甲　不錯，拉丁化要廢除漢字，可是拉丁化了的文字依然是中國話。話是中國話，不過用拉丁字母來拼音罷了。所以拉丁化了的中國文字决不是你所說的「鬼子話」。這是第一。第二，拉丁字母决不是外國人獨有的東西。</p>
<p>乙　不是洋鬼子的，那又是誰的呢？</p>
<p>甲　它是大家的東西。拉丁字、母經過了許多次的演變，而現在已成爲國際東西了。不單我打學代數要A+B+C……，就是醫生開的藥名，中國日本鐵路上的站名，郵局的戳子，打字機，旗語，……都少不得拉丁字母。你能說它不是國際的嗎？哈哈，連你身上穿的襯衫也是ABC公司的呢!</p>
<p>乙　但是我不懂，拉丁化爲什麼不採用一種標準語來統一全國，却去把方言拉丁化，這不是把中國人分裂起來了嗎？</p>
<p>甲　第一，你要知道，人們並不是靠了語言纔統一的。人們之間的統一和對立，是由他們物質的利害來决定的。在利害一致的人羣中，無論你用了什麽方法也不能阻止他們的「統一一，相反，在利害上矛盾的人們之間，卽使講相同語言，也不得不「對立」的。第二，中國目前並無一種全國統一的口頭語。目前還「沒有」的東西你立刻要它「有」，不但拉丁化做不到，無論什麽化都做不到的</p>
<p>乙　那麽漢字不是全國統一的嗎？</p>
<p>甲　不錯，漢字是全國統一的。但是懂得漢字的在十個中國人中只有兩個，漢字的存在與否和一般人幾乎沒有關係。因爲漢字的存在，他們並未沾過什麽光，倒反而吃了許多苦！</p>
<p>乙那麼假定有一天，一般人的生活好起來了，時間呀，錢呀都有了，那時候是不是可以來獲得漢字了呢？</p>
<p>甲　我看也不然，即照你說的那樣，他們也無如此做的必要。因爲我已經說過了，漢字的毛病不單在於「難」，而且還在於一壞」。我們旣有着很好的東西，何必再要這個壞東西呢？正像有了汽船帆船，可無需再坐獨木船樣。</p>
<p>乙　那麽你們一輩子就不要統一語了嗎？</p>
<p>甲　那又不然。拉丁化不但不反對，而且還主張要有統一語的。可是拉丁化的統一語，並非以一地的土話來強制全國。拉丁化的辦法是發展方言，促進它們之間的交溶，來助畏統一語的形成。方言不是拉丁化的永久的目標，我們不是「爲方言而方言」的。方言是歷史的範疇，隨着社會經濟的進展，方言必然消滅而形成統一語，最後以至於全世界共通語。所以拉丁化的方言，乃是達到統一、民族語的暫時的過渡的手段。</p>
<p>乙　你的意思是讓方言去自然發展，等待它來形成統一語嗎</p>
<p>甲　决不是如此。統一語的形成，是有它的客觀的條件的—社會經濟結構的改變，交通的發展，名地人們相互接觸及經騐交換（口頭的，書面的）的頻繁。但也須有主觀的條件—這就是文化和教育的進步，而在這方面必須以厲行方言拉丁化並交溶方言作爲最有力的因素。客觀條件固然是基本的，但若只憑客觀條件的進展而不加以主觀的推動和控制，則結果往往是遲緩的，但靠經騐而無理論的，甚荼走冤枉路而多受不必要的犧牲的。</p>
<p>乙　可是，假使一旦廢除漢字，各地都用起拉丁化來，那我們不是要回復到沒有文字的時代了嗎？比方說：上海人到廣東去考察或游歷。在有漢字的時候，他還可以籍漢字之助，讀當地的報紙，看得懂旅館裏電車上的價目表，菜館裏的菜單，他可以暢快地考察或者游歷。但是在實行拉丁化以後，他會弄得寸步難行，好像到了外國一樣！</p>
<p>甲　第一，拉丁化並不打算立刻廢止漢字，在拉丁化實行之初，漢字還能存在一個時期，懂得漢字的人自然不妨繼續使用，雖然漢字的使用範圍會逐漸狹小而終於被　棄的。所以，以爲拉丁化了以後會回到沒有文字的時代去，完全是一種不必要的杞憂。第二，我要問你所說的上海人，是怎樣的一種人？如果你說的是那些生活不大好的人，那麼他們目前何嘗有到廣東去考察」和「游歷一的福氣？而且苦力走進小飯館去吃飯，也從來不看菜單的。所以即在尚有漢字的目前，漢字也並未給他們一點方便，爲了漢字而吃虧的事倒是常見的。至於說到將來拉丁化普及之後吧，一則那時各區方言的傳習會總得極容易，二則即使只簡本區文字；報紙價目表及菜單到那時不妨用各區文字來印刷或書寫，目前上海不是就有五六種文字的報紙，電車裏也有英法漢文的價”表，俄國大菜館的藝單也是中俄文俱備的嗎？目前假定眞有個上海苦力能到廣東去「考察」，雖有漢字，他也會「寸步難行，好像到了外國一樣」的，而在拉丁化實行以後，即無漢字，他亦「可以暢快地考察或者游壓」的。如果你說的上海人是個洋行買辦，那更不成問題了。他們即使眞的「到了外國」，也能隨身帶着翻譯，决不會「寸步艱行」。但是對於他們的便利與否，拉丁化本來無意過問的。總而言之，看你的口氣，你似乎還在替已識漢字的人着想，而不是替文盲大衆着想。我們要知道：漢字的存在旣與普通一般人無關，他們也决不會因漢字的廢除而吃虧，在拉丁化的過程中，他們一無所失，反有所獲：那是明明白白的事。乙聽你的口氣，似乎主張馬上用拉丁化文字來教授文盲了，但是試問學會了拉丁化之後能有什麼用呢？目前的日報雜誌書籍不是多用漢字印的嗎？甲你這一問問得極有理！但是我要反問你一下：目前漢字印刷的日報，究有多少截連合於大衆閱讀的呢？適合於他們閱讀的雜誌書籍究有那幾種呢？他們即使吃了一顆仙丹，從明天起就能閱讀漢字了，他們也會覺得沒有東西可讀。所以即使文盲全識了漢字，問題也是沒有完全解决的。拉丁化還在推行時期，所以目前和漢字一樣的沒有什麼東西可供他們閱讀。但是隨着拉丁化的普及，從事於拉丁化的人如能積極編印一些大衆讀物，只要一年之後，恐怕已略識漢字的大衆，不舉拉丁化倒要無書可讀的了。</p>
<p>乙　那麼你對於胡愈之主張的「別字」，有什麽意見呢？</p>
<p>甲　他的主張雖然有一二人擁護過，但連他自己都沒有用「別字」寫過第二篇文章，從這點上也可看出他的辦法之難於實行的了，而且，我始終覺得他的所謂「別字」，並非真的別字，乃是簡筆字。比方他用「賈直」代「價值」，而不用筆劃更少的「介之」，便是一例。我曾經把他在「太白」上發表的那篇文章細細做過統計，結果祇有兩個不知三個詞兒是全部用別字寫的，如「擁護」之寫做「永戶」，其他都是由簡筆字或一個別字一個正字組成的。可惜我那張紙不在身邊，否則我可以給你具體的數字的。他的辦法行到極點，即到最理想的時候，就是漢字的字母化，每羣同音的漢字中各以一個漢字爲代表。然而，在北方話中同音的漢字羣約有四百五十左右，也就是說，他的那副字母表要有四百五十個字母，比拉丁化要多四百二十多個！</p>
<p>乙　最後，我還想聽聽你對於手頭字的意見呢。</p>
<p>甲　手頭字混入漢字（正宇）的陣營，搗亂漢字的後方，撕破它的尊嚴的外衣，促進它的解體——在這點上它可以說是拉丁化的友軍。但是它的作用也就盡於此了，此外並無積極的意義。而且手頭字有一個極大的危機，便是它一出來，有些人便給以過高的評價，好像手頭字一普及，中國語文問題便解决了似的。其實字形的改變，而且大部份還祇是筆劃的減少，除了祇能給已識稍識及將識漢字的人書寫上的若干便利之外，再沒有別的了。——喔，時間不早了，明兒再見吧。</p>
<p>乙　正是「聽君一夕話，勝讀十年書」。咱們明兒冉見吧。</p>

<p>— 雲</p>
<p>到湖社的時候纔八時有半，而觀衆已經是滿座了。很費一點時間才找到一個座位。我用一種懷疑的目光，在等待着這悲劇的演出。祗訓練了三個月的這個劇中的演員，我看過了這次試演以後，眞覺得有點兒驚奇！詳細的情形是這樣的：</p>
<p>劇本：雖只是一個戀愛的故事，但因爲編制手法的高妙，在藝術的成就上自有它相當的價值。</p>
<p>演員：飾沈秀娟的洪瑛演來很合身分，那種放蕩潑辣的舉止很夠味兒。飾秀娟丈夫的呂平，動作表情自然而且沉着，但那天的聲音彷彿啞了些。飾鄒翊生的戴浩，他天生一副滑頭的臉，演來亦能體貼入微。其次像楊鐸，程靜子，白雄長，范演甫，黃雲，徐麗琳，錢風，在他們所担任的角色上均極能稱職。總之，在整個的演出，在每個演員的表現上，我可以說是有相當的成功的。</p>
<p>燈光：據說是臨時租借的，但成續還不壞。</p>
<p>佈景：也沒有什麽可以指責的地方，只是在兩幕接替時動作過於遲緩一點，略略使人感到不愉快。</p>
<p>其他：在配音方面，和劇情也很能夠吻合。不過，第五幕那一個悲慘的塲面，如果能再以音樂的力量來滋助觀衆同情心的增長，那恐怕還可使劇情生動些哩！</p>
<h3 id="c227">看了「人之初」 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 欽</p>
<p>最近在金城大戲院開映的藝華聲片「人之初」，在各方面都可以說是一張值得一看的好片子。特別使我感到興味的，乃是這張片子還觸到了語言文字的問題。</p>
<p>船夫張榮根夫婦，爲了求生的艱難，把落地不久的孩子仁弟送給富紳黃子敬去做兒子。把「自己的肉」送給人家，榮根失婦的悲痛是不用說的。把孩子抱到黃家後，一回兒黃老爺拿着一張寫就的契約出來了，問道：「榮根，你識字嗎？」</p>
<p>「稍稍識幾個字，老爺，請你念一遍吧！」眼淚在發着光。</p>
<p>在黃老爺的莊嚴的朗讀聲中，榮根夫婦在發抖，晞噓。他們不懂：這上面寫了些什麽。他們是無需懂的，終于是畫了押。握慣櫓的粗魯的手一把握住了一枝細細的筆，手在打顫，忍住了眼淚，在老婆的低泣聲中畫了個十字。</p>
<p>榮根的老婆在黃老爺的廠裏做了十多年的工，已經成了個癱子，整天在床上害病，嘴裏呌着已經做了少爺的仁弟的名字。榮根爲了安慰快要死去的老婆，打算到賬房要去偷張少爺仁弟的照片，結果被當作小賊抓到法庭上去審。榮根把少爺是自己的兒子的話說了出來。法官問了：</p>
<p>「有什麼瞪據呢？」</p>
<p>「有一張紙的。」榮根答。</p>
<p>「怎樣寫的呢？」法官問。</p>
<p>「……」榮根答不出，他連那張紙也找不到了。於是他當作小賊吃官司　了。</p>
<p>這正是目前漢字最大的效用，是象形漢字服役於黃老爺之類的人們的　具體的例子。</p>
<p>此外，小根和金弟戀愛時配着的蘇白的小調，無綫電中放出來的蘇白的說書，也可見導演對於方言採用得很得當。榮根在燈下看連環圖畫「薛仁貴征東」這一個畫面，也是使我感到很大與味的。</p>

<p>— 辰</p>
<p>研究哲學的人常怕被人考問「哲學是什麼」，但更怕被人考問「哲學有什麽用」。這是哲學史上的問題。從希臘大哲蘇格拉底起，一直到專在三段論中玩把戲而不向外研究實際問題的經院學派的中世紀止，哲學是一種生的學問：牠研究宇宙問的一切，受人的尊重，尊爲立身處世的指針，尊爲科學的皇后。但經過中世紀後，哲學是變成死的了。笛卡兒說「我思故我在」，他是把宇宙一切放在思想上，再把思想通過非物質的靈魂「我」，這樣一來，於解决人生問題能嗎？哲學自專在認識論的象牙塔裏作論爭後，不但牠的領土被科學佔將殆盡了，並且遭了人們的冷眼和遺忘。你看在現代哲學中，不再是研究切實的人生問題，却變爲乾枯的心與物的問題，實體與現象的問題，理性與感覺的問題</p>
<p>以上接第五版</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>，忘了真理和智慧的搜求，忘了對於人生的意義的影響，哲學是日在毀滅的途中。</p>
<p>現在再來看一看現實的人生吧！從十九世紀科學昌明和產業革命後，人們居於瑣碎的騷擾的機械世界中，自然的偷理道德與宗教信仰破壞了，奢侈與肉慾的生活替代了苦行主義，不安的刺戟替代了安分的知足心，化學的戰爭到處都潛伏者，一切性關係上的新見解以至靈魂上的幻影擺脫都在地球上蠕動着，除掉機械論和宿命論外，人們是再也摸索不到一個生命的歸宿了。至於哲學本身呢，昔之宇宙論已變爲天文學與地象學，昔之「自然科學」已變爲生物學與物理學，今之「精神哲學」又將變爲心理學。「哲學完了！」大家也許都會同聲地這樣喊着吧！</p>
<p>但是，哲學眞的完了嗎？不！你看數理學家所指示的只是些抽象的理論和乾枯的程式，生物學家所爭論的是「漸變」「突變」「先天」「後天」的問題，心理學家雖重於行爲的分析，但也祇是些「腦」「腺」「感官」「筋肉」「反應」「刺戟」等等名詞，對於實際的人生問題都難有貢獻。這任務是祇有哲學能担當了。哲學將界敘整個的見地，囊括全生命，欲自混沌的狀態中，求出一致性的心靈上的企圖，包括各種可以影響於生活的價值與意義的問題。哲學須同科學一樣，用或種方法去「彌補」人生的「缺憾」，如醫學彌補疾病一樣，而這缺憾是由慾望而起的。</p>
<p>現在有句口號，就是沒有哲學祗有人生哲學。其實他祇觀察到了一部分而沒有整個地加以深究。我們知道宇宙間的一切與人類慾望發生關係時方有價值——正同研究經濟學一樣——；但慾望是變遷無常的，要使之變成一致性或協調，則惟有哲學；這在知識與工具（科學）是很難奏效的。這就是科學與哲學的問題。譬如說，科學家對於氣氣，他祇說氯氣的化合物或成分怎樣，效用怎樣：但對於生活上的終結問題，如是否應該破壞人類的文化，美德，知識，藝術品，以及一切建設等問題的研究，這却是哲學的任務了。又如明明是膚黑唇黑的黑婦，同族中的偉男子却以爲是奇美：沉浸於財富中的生活甜蜜呢？抑是沐浴於創造中的生活甜蜜呢？這幾多問題都非科學所能昭示的。這就是科學與哲學的分別。那末哲學可以不要科學而成爲經院學派了？這又是錯誤的。因爲人類的智慧若沒有科學作爲基礎，就不能發長成熟，甚至變爲腐朽與不誠實，日與人類生活游離。同時，科學若沒有哲學意義，就變成殘酷與無意義的東西。牠倆是相互依賴的。歸納以上所說，哲學的任務約有這幾種：（一）用綜合的見地，來研究最後與終局問題：（二）以各種科學作萬有全體的基礎，居於科學之上，用踞高臨下的「態度」，解决科學所不能解决的問題（如宇宙與人生）：（三）撥開現象而研究本體（科學所研究的是現象，如自然現象，社會現象，哲學所研究的是本體，如心與物）。（未完）</p>

<p>這次「娜拉」公演，非但演員全是影界及劇壇的明星宿將，即舞台工作人員，亦全是上海舞台工作的第一流人物，如樊伯滋歐陽山尊的燈光，宋小江的化裝，鄭山尊的道具，朱今明的裝置，楊齊明的攝影，王琪的服裝，皆爲曾經各次大小公演之工作員，可爲集影劇最優秀之工作人員於一堂云。</p>
<p>舞台裝置放一異彩</p>
<p>中國歷來的舞台裝置，大概是採自日本或美國的，最近乘美國式送置景更流行於中國的舞台上，看這種置景時常沒有演變，是會顯示演出淺薄及低級味來的，這次「娜拉」公演，好像雷音哈特劇團似的，採集多方面的舞台設計，完成一眞實的十九世紀的佈景，牆上的彫刻及窗飾等，無不細心考究，可謂打破目前舞台設計的紀錄。</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Cao Yujian, navigator of the Haiqi, said on the 22nd that the Haiqi and Haishen passed Hengtang at 6:45 PM on the 21st and encountered the Ninghai, Hairong, and Haichou sailing in a character shape. The Ninghai was in the lead, raising the commander's flag and firing more than 30 cannons. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Ninghai arrived in Hong Kong late at night on the 21st and anchored in Kowloon Bay at 2:00 AM on the 22nd. At 8:00 AM, Xue Yu, the commander of the Hong Kong Navy, sent his chief of staff to visit Chen Jiliang, the commander of the Haiqi. At 9:00 AM, the two sides exchanged gun salutes to pay their respects. Acting Governor of Hong Kong, Shaw Dun, also visited the ship at 12:30 PM. It is heard that the Ninghai will add coal and water and lead the Haiqi and Haishen north. (22nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Haiqi, Haishen, and Zhaohe ships of the navy stationed in Guangdong suddenly left Guangdong on the 15th due to a dispute over funding. The Zhaohe temporarily did not leave due to engine damage. The details have been reported in the newspapers in recent days. After receiving reports from Chen Jitang and the escaped ships, the Central Government sent warships currently conducting naval exercises to monitor them to avoid accidents. However, those with ulterior motives fabricated rumors, intending to provoke, falsely claiming that the Central Government had instigated the situation beforehand and had threatened to blockade Guangzhou. It is not known that warships belong to the country and cannot be divided by their location. A reporter from the Central News Agency asked a senior naval official about the cause of this incident. According to him, the navy should be unified and obey the Central Government and the Navy Department. This is the case in all countries with navies. Due to various complex circumstances, China's navy has failed to follow normal procedures, resulting in an abnormal situation. It is heard that the Haiqi and Haishen will return to the naval establishment to realize naval unification. Warships currently conducting naval exercises have been dispatched to handle the matter. (22nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) The local authorities here are paying close attention to the news of the new developments outside Hong Kong last night. It is heard that Gan Jiai-hou has been sent to Hong Kong to closely monitor the situation. It is likely that the authorities will not decide on any action until they receive a report from Hong Kong. According to official sources, Chen Jitang did ask the Hong Kong government to detain the two rebel ships. Jiang Xiyuan and others are still in prison. The authorities have also arrested several more people, reportedly related to the Dapeng Bay case. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Forty naval cadets on the Haiqi and Haishen are currently detained by the rebels of the two ships as a guarantee for the safety of Jiang Xiyuan's life. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) It is heard that the Navy Department will soon publish an article explaining the course of negotiations between Nanjing and the commanders of the Haiqi and other ships. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The strange cruiser encountered by the Haishen and Haiqi outside Hong Kong yesterday sailed into the harbor after midnight. Everyone saw that it was the newest cruiser in the Chinese fleet, the Ninghai. This ship was ordered by the Navy Department to come here to escort the Haiqi and other two ships north. Chen Jiliang, Vice Minister of the Navy Department, and British consultant to the Navy Department, Morse, are both on the Ninghai. Ninghai crew members told reporters that they had ordered the Haiqi and Haishen to return to Hong Kong and wait for orders after the rebel ships had contacted the Central Government. The Ninghai Line will accompany them north within a few days. The Ninghai was originally patrolling in Xiamen and was later ordered by Nanjing to come to Hong Kong to clean up the two escaped ships. At the same time, two other Nanjing warships, the Haichou and Hairong, also sailed to a bay several miles from Hong Kong. In total, there are six Nanjing warships near Hong Kong, including the Tongji. It is not yet known what mission the Tongji has after entering the harbor yesterday. It is speculated that the Tongji came here to report the actions of the two rebel ships to the warships guarding outside the harbor via radio. The commanders of the two ships, in talks with Reuters interviewers, confirmed the story of the Ninghai firing cannons. It is said that Chen Jiliang raised a signal after firing a cannon warning, and the two ships immediately sailed back to Hong Kong to await orders. Their relationship with Nanjing remains harmonious. According to the Englishman guarding the Waglan Lighthouse, the Ninghai fired a total of twelve cannons, and the escaped ships also returned fire. Nanjing can now ask the Hong Kong government to return the two ships through diplomatic channels. At the same time, one British submarine and one destroyer had all personnel who had been granted shore leave recalled, and another British destroyer sailed to Kowloon Bay to monitor the two ships and prevent anyone from landing. The sailors on the two ships are now obviously divided, and some have detained Chen Hao, the commander of the Haiqi, hoping to use him as a hostage to exchange for Jiang Xiyuan, who is being detained in Guangdong. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Japanese Consulate here denies rumors that naval rebels will sell the Haiqi and other two ships to the Japanese. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Reuters has learned that the British authorities will continue to treat the Haishen and Haiqi as part of the Chinese fleet until the British government receives a note from the Nanjing government declaring them as rebel ships. (13th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e18">The Future of Anglo-American Cooperation <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Baldwin stated last month that if Britain and the United States could cooperate, it would be the most effective guarantee of world peace. This statement is indeed accurate. The talk of Anglo-American cooperation has been ongoing for a long time, but its realization seems yet to come. Tracing back to the Manchurian Incident, Stimson of the United States requested joint action from Britain. After the London Naval Preliminary Talks last year, there was a tendency for Anglo-American cooperation. Since this spring, this atmosphere has become even more pronounced. For example, Lytton's visit to the United States emphasized the necessity of Anglo-American cooperation, and General Smuts of South Africa also stated at the same time that Anglo-American cooperation is indispensable. These arguments often rise and fall with the Far Eastern situation. Whenever the situation becomes tense, the call for cooperation suddenly becomes loud, and when the situation eases, the atmosphere of cooperation subsides. Therefore, although the intention is good, it does not help the facts. Recently, with the events in North China, Britain and the United States have again discussed using the Nine-Power Treaty to deal with the situation, but so far there has been no action. What is the crux of this? It is indeed a question worth noting.</p>
<p>According to our observation, the reason why Britain and the United States only have empty intentions for cooperation and have been slow to take action is due to several reasons: First, the situation in Europe, where France and Germany are still in opposition, and Italy also has great ambitions, posing a threat to European peace at any time. With Europe unstable, Britain can hardly attend to other matters. Second, the purpose of Anglo-American cooperation is nothing more than to restrain Japan's actions. If Japan is not restrained, it will inevitably resort to war. However, such a war would provide the Soviet Union with an opportunity to develop, which is also not what Britain and the United States desire. Therefore, if Britain and the United States do not have a firm grasp on controlling Russia, they will certainly not want to offend Japan. This kind of fear of Russia is especially strong in Britain, because once the power of the Soviet Union expands, Britain's Asian treasure, India, will be the first to suffer a great threat. Third, the United States' currency devaluation has caused great losses to Britain, while Britain's delay in repaying war debts, which is tantamount to defaulting on debts, has also made the United States feel very unhappy, and they are deeply wary of repeating the mistakes of joining the war last time. These are all reasons why it is difficult for Britain and the United States to cooperate effectively.</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, it can be seen that the key to Anglo-American cooperation lies in whether a collective peace system in Europe can be established, what measures Britain and the United States will take regarding the future expansion of Soviet power, and whether the economic relations between Britain and the United States themselves can be adjusted. According to recent foreign news reports, after the establishment of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, Britain is still planning to proceed with the various conventions in the Anglo-French London Declaration of February 3 to promote a collective peace system in Europe. If European peace can be established, Britain's attention can be shifted to the Far East. Also, according to recent news, Britain and the United States are again brewing to convene an international monetary conference, and the economic relations between Britain and the United States may therefore have a chance of coordination. Is it then possible for Anglo-American cooperation to become a reality? However, what we should pay attention to is that even if Anglo-American cooperation is realized, it may not have the effect of eradicating Japanese power. Based on the current situation, the future of cooperation will at most push the collective peace system currently being implemented in Europe to the Far East, so that countries with interests in the Far East can participate together to restrain the free actions of any one country. Considering that the British are still maintaining friendly relations with Japan, and that American naval officers advocate taking a defensive policy against Japan, and that President Roosevelt has repeatedly warned the military not to take actions that would harm diplomatic relations, the weight of Anglo-American Far Eastern policy can also be understood.</p>

<p>(Paris) The recent rift in Anglo-French cooperation: British Minister Without Portfolio Eden began his repair work today. After Eden arrived in Paris, he was hosted at a banquet by French Prime Minister Laval. Immediately after the banquet, naval armament talks began. Subsequently, Laval issued a statement as follows: "We have studied the naval agreement recently concluded between Britain and Germany with complete sincerity. Eden informed us of the reasons why the British government made this decision, and I reiterated the French government's reservations regarding this matter. The personal relationship between me and Eden is sufficient to prove the friendly nature of the talks. We also jointly studied various issues presented by the European situation to our two governments. We recognize the necessity for close cooperation between the two governments." During the discussions, the strong spirit of friendship expressed by both sides made people feel optimistic, feeling that the haze that had been secretly sown between Britain and France as a result of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement was about to dissipate. France still insists that the Western European Air Pact must be an indivisible whole with the Eastern European Pact and the Danube Pact. Some parts may be negotiated separately, but can only be established simultaneously. It is reported that Laval asked Eden whether Britain still adheres to this principle, as this was agreed upon by the two countries in London in February of this year. Britain at that time was especially willing to complete the Air Pact as soon as possible, without waiting for the resolution of the Central and Eastern European issues before doing so. Now it seems that Britain is not following this path. Eden replied that he must first consult with the government. Tomorrow, talks between the two sides will continue. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) British Minister Without Portfolio Eden, who is currently in Paris, has recently communicated with the British government by telephone and inquired about the opinions put forward by France. It is reported that the British government has indicated that it intends to give France certain guarantees regarding the Air Pact and the Naval Agreement. Regarding the Air Pact, Britain will never conclude a separate agreement with Germany unless all signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty participate. As for the establishment of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, if France increases its naval shipbuilding, Britain should not use this as a reason to increase its warships. This point is also recognized by Britain. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) It was learned here today that Hitler has probably agreed to rejoin the League of Nations as an exchange condition for Britain's support for his rearmament. People here generally believe that Eden has stated this to Prime Minister Laval and regard it as part of the reason for Britain's signing of the naval agreement with Germany. It is heard that Eden, when talking with Laval, requested Laval to consider the following four suggestions: (1) The Western European countries should immediately conclude an air force convention, in which Germany may be included. (2) Eden summarized Hitler's concessions before the signing of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. (3) Germany's rearmament has become a reality, and Britain's purpose is to try its best to curb it. Britain hopes that this move can stop the arms race in Europe. (4) Request that Britain, France, and Italy continue to cooperate. People generally believe that Eden has won another diplomatic victory and averted the crisis of a break between Britain and France. Although France initially expressed shock at Britain's signing of the naval agreement with Germany, it recognized that a door for negotiating German armament issues has now been opened.

<p>(Paris) The Anglo-French talks ended at 3:15 pm today. British Minister Without Portfolio Eden will soon depart for Rome. When returning to his country from Rome, he will pass through Paris and meet with Prime Minister Laval again. According to reports, after Eden consulted with the British cabinet by telephone this morning, the future of the negotiations has become smoother. However, the British government believes that the issues raised by France are very serious in nature, so it must wait for the cabinet meeting to discuss them before making a concrete decision. After the Anglo-French talks ended, Prime Minister Laval issued a declaration, saying, "We have considered the various issues raised by the current international situation. We have also reviewed the Anglo-French Declaration of February 3 and discussed the ways in which the two governments can cooperate. We all believe that it is necessary to find practical ways to resolve the various issues raised in the London Declaration, as these issues are not only related to the two countries, but also to other countries in Europe." Laval continued to declare that the two governments will remain committed to the collective security policy. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to reliable sources, although Britain has invited French naval experts to London for talks, France does not intend to send experts to Britain, at least not for such talks at the moment. However, France will participate in the naval conference to be held at the end of this year. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) The French government sent a note to the British government on June 17, raising some opinions on the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. It is learned that the British government has sent a note replying to France, which has been delivered to the French Ambassador to Britain, Corbin, for transmission to the French government. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>The British Ambassador Asks Russia to Participate in the Meeting</p>
<p>(Moscow) The British Ambassador, Seeds, has informed the Soviet Russian Foreign Minister, Litvinov, of the results of the Anglo-German Naval Conference, and stated that Britain hopes that Russia will also participate in the naval conference, in order to complete the qualitative and quantitative disarmament. The British government will also notify the Soviet Russian government of the progress of negotiations with related countries at any time. Litvinov replied that he would report the British proposal to the People's Committee, and that the Soviet Union has ordered the Soviet Russian Ambassadors in London, Paris, and Rome to inform the governments of the stationed countries of their country's opinions on the naval issue and the air force convention issue. (National News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The bulletin of the Soviet Union's Heavy Industry Committee commented on the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, saying, "In any case, one thing is clear: no matter how the British Foreign Minister declares, the Anglo-German Naval Agreement has neither reduced naval armament nor consolidated European security." (Tass, 21st)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Pravda pointed out that the Anglo-German Naval Agreement will have even greater consequences for the entire international situation, saying, "The increase in German armaments will be used as an excuse for Britain to expand its navy. Therefore, the purpose of this agreement is indeed to initiate an arms race. This agreement is the last nail in the coffin of the idea of disarmament on land, sea, and air." (Tass, 21st)</p>
<p>British and German Representatives Discuss Shipbuilding Procedures</p>
<p>(London) The chief German naval representative, Ribbentrop, met with Foreign Secretary Sir Hoare again in the afternoon, and also met with Naval Minister Monsell and Chief of Naval Staff Chatfield. Generally, if British and German naval experts can finalize the German shipbuilding procedures within tomorrow, the German delegation will return to their country on Sunday. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Times commented on the visit of the British Minister Without Portfolio Eden to Paris, saying, "The navy and the air force are most important to Britain. For the sake of Britain, they should be resolved first. This point is certainly understood by people. However, Germany's land armament is not only related to French security, but is also most important and related to the security of all countries on the continent. It is hoped that our British friends can also understand this point. The current British diplomatic policy is already incompatible with the cooperation policies of Stresemann and Geneva. We French feel particularly confused and uneasy. Eden, who has a clear understanding of the European situation, cannot be unaware of this." The Intransigeant also made a similar argument, saying that if Britain is consistent and truly hopes for cooperation between Britain and France, Eden's visit will certainly declare to France that Britain is willing to cooperate with France on all current international issues. Cooperation itself is not a problem. The problem lies in how to cooperate. If Britain cannot cooperate effectively with France, then France does not need to cooperate with Britain. Regarding this point, Eden has a clear responsibility to explain it. We will wait and see." (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) The newspapers are generally optimistic about the Anglo-French talks in Paris. The Daily Telegraph reported, "We have good reason to believe that there will be progress tomorrow night. So far, Britain and France have agreed on the wording of their response to the German memorandum. This German memorandum raises objections to the Franco-Russian mutual assistance treaty, saying that it conflicts with the obligations stipulated in the Locarno Treaty and requests that the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty clarify it." The Times said, "After Prime Minister Laval of France finished talking with Minister Without Portfolio Eden yesterday, he said that the reservations put forward by France still exist. From this, it can be seen that the French government still believes that the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, whether in spirit or in words, is contrary to the united front of Britain, France, and Italy. Fortunately, Eden responded appropriately and was able to make a deep impression on the French side. The talks should be successful tomorrow." (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The establishment of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement is considered here to be Germany's greatest diplomatic success and a new starting point for various international negotiations. People in the German Foreign Ministry strongly claim that this agreement is a great diplomatic victory, and the National Socialist Party believes that the procedure for achieving equal rights advocated in Hitler's speech on May 21 has been concretely recognized, and that the Anglo-German naval talks were handled single-handedly by Hitler's new confidant Ribbentrop. Therefore, Germany's rapprochement with Britain is also Hitler's personal success. Semi-officially, it is believed that Hitler's book "Mein Kampf" criticized Germany's naval policy before the war and advocated coordination with Britain. Now Hitler's idea has become a reality. Since Germany recognizes Britain's naval superiority, Britain can also reduce its intervention in Germany's attempts in Central Europe. The National Socialist Party is now discussing that Ribbentrop may go to Paris to find ways to conclude an agreement with France similar to the Anglo-German Agreement. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>The Abyssinian Question is Not Discussed</p>
<p>(Rome) The British Commissioner to the League of Nations, Eden, will arrive here tonight or tomorrow morning. According to reliable political sources, when Eden meets with Prime Minister Mussolini, it has been decided not to discuss the Abyssinian question. His mission is limited to contacting naval issues, that is, the new note recently submitted by the League of Nations on Abyssinia will also be shelved indefinitely, as the mediation committee is currently studying the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, and it is not appropriate to create additional complications. (National News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Eden's conversation with reporters proves that he and Laval did not mention the Abyssinian question. Moreover, from the comments of various newspapers, it can be seen that France does not want to give the impression of interfering in the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. This attitude of France is a direct result of the signing of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and is also due to the repeated warnings from French newspapers to the authorities not to force Italy to withdraw from the League of Nations. Eden told reporters that after he returns to Britain from Rome, he will advocate negotiating the Italian-Abyssinian issue with France. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italy recently recruited 8,000 workers in Egypt, preparing to send them to work in Italian colonies in East Africa. This matter was prohibited by the Egyptian government authorities.

<p>(Rome) A few days ago, some Abyssinians insulted the Italian flag outside a cinema in Addis Ababa. According to the Italian side, these people were members of the Abyssinian Air Force who tore off the Italian flag on the car of the First Secretary of the Italian Embassy and cursed the Italians. After the Italian Embassy negotiated with the Abyssinian government, the Abyssinian government formally apologized today. The Italian Embassy expressed satisfaction, but it still needs to see how the Abyssinian government punishes the criminals. (Reuters, 20th)</p>

The most important ones are as follows: (1) Strive for reconciliation with Germany. (2) Cooperate with the United States. (3) Britain's attitude towards Japan's progress in China will no longer be as tolerant as before. As for diplomatic personnel, there will also be a large number of changes. Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Vansittart will succeed Lindsay as Ambassador to the United States. The vacant Under-Secretary of State will be filled by the current Ambassador to France, Clerk. (Havas, 21st)</p>

<p>Brussels Belgian Prime Minister Theunis replied in writing to the questions of members of parliament today, saying that Belgium and the Soviet Union have not yet had formal negotiations on restoring diplomatic relations. However, regarding the issue of whether there have been informal negotiations, the Prime Minister stated that it was inconvenient to make any announcement, only saying that this was unavoidable. It is reported that Vandervelde, the leader of the Second International, is the de facto Prime Minister of Belgium at present. He recently discussed the issue of restoring Russian-Belgian diplomatic relations with Soviet Russian Ambassador Potemkin in France. However, Vandervelde requested that the Soviet Union first stop its communist propaganda that hinders the Belgian Socialist Party. The informal negotiations mentioned by Theunis may refer to this.

<p>Belgrade Prince Regent Paul received Maček, the leader of the Croatian opposition party, in the afternoon. The conversation lasted for one and a half hours. It is heard that the content of the conversation is extremely important. Since January 5, 1929, when former King Alexander ordered the abolition of the constitution, Maček has only come to the capital twice to confront the State Protection Court's accusation that he was suspected of endangering the country. In addition, Maček has never come to the capital to meet with government authorities. Now that the regent summoned Maček and inquired about him, it is not only a victory for the Croatian Peasant Party, but also a victory for the joint group of Croatian and Serbian opposition parties, as Maček is the leader of the opposition group. Maček declared to the Havas News Agency, "I am not speaking here on behalf of the Croatian nation, but on behalf of the opposition group." Maček also visited the Minister of the Army and Navy, Jevtić. According to general opinion, the new cabinet may be a nationally concentrated cabinet, with Stojadinović, the Minister of Finance of the Jevtić cabinet, serving as the Prime Minister, and cooperating with various old political parties. If not, a neutral cabinet may be organized, with General Jevtić serving as the Prime Minister, because the parties of the Croatian nation have not opposed Jevtić personally. However, according to Maček's declaration, the opposition cabinet, no matter how it is organized, will demand the restoration of civil liberties and legal guarantees, or even demand the adoption of a free and secret voting system to re-elect the parliament. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>Belgrade Maček, the leader of the opposition group, recently declared to a representative of the Havas News Agency, "In my conversations with Prince Regent Paul and Minister of the Navy General Jevtić, I sincerely stated what necessary measures should be taken to create a new situation and a new atmosphere, so that various domestic issues, especially the Croatian national issue, can be effectively resolved." In addition, Maček declared to other reporters, "In any case, we will never attend this session of the House of Representatives, but we are currently on the path to understanding." (Havas, 22nd)</p>

In Vienna alone, there are 2,000 attempted suicides each year, three times higher than before the European War. The newspaper believes that although Austria's economic difficulties are not unrelated to the increase in the suicide rate, the main reason seems to lie in the psychological and spiritual suffering of the Austrians.

<p>—Japanese and Puppets Respond with Air Squadrons—Jilin Correspondence, the headquarters of the puppet Second Military District, whose defense area is the two puppet provinces of Jilin and Jiandao, is currently facing fierce activity from the Righteous Army. The Japanese and puppet troops have repeatedly launched joint attacks, but to no avail. The Righteous Army, on the other hand, disintegrates into smaller units and reassembles, adapting to the circumstances, which has left the joint Japanese and puppet forces struggling to cope. Ground security has not yet been established. In addition, due to disasters, the number of poor farmers is increasing, and large numbers of Korean farmers are moving in. Conflicts have erupted fiercely between Han and Korean farmers. As a result, many have joined the Righteous Army to resist the puppet regime and hope to restore their homeland. The Japanese and puppets regard these elements as agricultural bandits under the Righteous Army system, with underlying forces opposing the puppet organization driving them. Therefore, they are actively attacking. However, due to inconvenient transportation and difficulties in communication for the Japanese and puppet troops, they have decided to use small unit guerrilla tactics - a combined land-air response strategy. The advisory department (composed of Japanese officers) of the Southeast Defense Area Security Maintenance Association of the puppet Second Military District has suggested establishing a flight squadron in Jilin, stationing permanent security aircraft to coordinate with ground troops, detect explosions, and provide operational cover. However, the Righteous Army remains extremely active. (Northeast News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e99">General Chiang Kai-shek's Speech on National Salvation Education in Chengdu - Implementation of Education Combining Civil and Military Affairs Is Essential - <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Chengdu Correspondence, the 17th, 9:00 AM. The third expanded memorial week of General Chiang Kai-shek's visit to Chengdu was held. Attendees included General Chiang Kai-shek</p>
<p>"It all depends on human effort," Luo Fei smiled, trying to cheer up Lu Wen. "Is that right?"</p>
<p>"I hope so."</p>
<p>"Shouldn't you be congratulating me?" Luo Fei changed the subject. "You should be happy."</p>
<p>Lu Wen indeed smiled, and not just a smile, he even jumped with joy.</p>
<p>"Of course, I should congratulate you. I'll buy you a thank-you gift later."</p>
<p>The two of them walked along the left side of the road on the sidewalk. They were heading home. Although they were tired, they felt a lot more energetic. They looked proud, and the sky seemed to deliberately brighten up to illuminate their path ahead.</p>
<p>"I forgot to ask you, when do you officially start working?" Lu Wen suddenly remembered. "When does it start?"</p>
<p>"Tomorrow at nine."</p>
<p>"Tomorrow you'll be a person with a job."</p>
<p>"Our life will be a little more settled."</p>
<p>But Lu Wen thought of something else with ulterior motives. Why did he have to think about this? He felt bad. He felt that his wife's employment was not a success of her skills, but rather similar to the yellow aspect of a prostitute. However, confining his wife at home to be a good wife and mother was not his idea either. He had always advocated that women, like men, should serve society and do things.</p>
<p>When there is no job, you are afraid of not finding one. When you have a job, you think of other side issues. How contradictory!</p>
<p>Luo Fei was also recalling the moment in the manager's house earlier. When she thought about it, she was worried about her future. If the manager continued to be frivolous, how would she deal with it? The continuation of her job also depended on him. As long as he was unhappy for a moment, she could be sacrificed. It seemed that she could not act against his wishes, but if she did, there would be more problems later. After thinking and thinking, she couldn't come up with a safe solution. The final decision was still to act as she had answered Lu Wen: It all depends on human effort. She added an explanation: Stay if it suits, leave if it doesn't.</p>
<p>Lu Wen walked along and bought two packets of peanuts. He kept one for himself and handed the other to his wife, smiling and saying:</p>
<p>"Fei, this is my congratulatory gift to you."</p>
<p>"Too meager. Well, a small gift with great meaning."</p>
<p>Luo Fei also smiled.</p>
<p>The customs clock was pointing to twelve o'clock. Small clerks from companies and banks took buses or trams to go home for lunch, while others went to nearby restaurants to fill their stomachs. Every vehicle was very crowded. "Another one behind!" the ticket seller shouted.</p>
<p>Lu Wen and Luo Fei were also a little hungry and wanted to hurry home to cook. After walking for a while, Lu Wen led his wife onto a bus. After they sat down, he whispered:</p>
<p>"Anyway, we've got a job, let's join the hustle and bustle." Director He, Chairman Liu, Director Kang, Secretary-General Yang, Living Buddha Nuona, and military generals, party and government officials, and representatives from all walks of life, about 1,300 people, were presided over by General Chiang Kai-shek. After performing the rituals, General Chiang Kai-shek gave a speech, the original text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman Liu, comrades, today our leaders from all walks of life in Chengdu are gathered here again to hold the Memorial Week of the Premier. What I want to say to you is to continue the meaning of what I said in the last Memorial Week, how our leaders from all walks of life should make all those who are taught by us, whether they are children at home, students at school, or subordinates in various institutions and armies, understand the principles of being human in the world and the responsibilities they should bear to the society and the country, and be able to do their best for the society and the country. To achieve this, responsible leaders from all walks of life must be able to lead by example and teach effectively. When it comes to teaching methods, in the past, our ancestors taught people, whether it was family education, school education, or social education, they all emphasized both literary and martial arts, combining civil and military affairs, and cultivating both skills and virtues. They not only wanted to make the educated people understand literary affairs, but also wanted to make them understand martial arts, because if a person does not understand martial arts, he cannot defend himself, protect his neighbors, let alone defend the country and the nation. However, today's education has forgotten this most important principle. Civil and military affairs are completely separated. Literati do not learn martial arts, and warriors do not know literary affairs. It has led to the bad habit of valuing literature and despising martial arts. As a result, each person at most only knows half of the truth. Therefore, there is no complete knowledge, no complete personality, and they cannot fully fulfill their responsibilities as human beings. Therefore, our society and country have been brought to such a state of weakness and danger. Everyone should know that in today's world, all first-class powerful countries have their education that combines civil and military affairs and emphasizes both. It can be said that their education methods are exactly the same as those of our ancestors. For example, the so-called five major powers, Britain, America, France, Italy, and Japan, are all like this. Especially modern emerging countries, such as Germany, Russia, and Turkey, all prioritize martial arts. Not only men have to learn martial arts, but women also have to learn martial arts. Therefore, they can promote the strong and vigorous national spirit, create a magnificent national power, and complete their cause of national revival. From this, it can be seen that if we want to be modern citizens and revive our country and nation from decline and danger, we must correct the bad habit of valuing literature and despising martial arts, restore the ancient education of "combining civil and military affairs," and make all compatriots, regardless of men, women, old or young, have martial arts and be able to defend themselves and the country. Secondly, where should we start learning martial arts? The only important thing is to first forge a strong physique, because if the people do not have a strong physique, they will not have a strong spirit and sufficient strength to fulfill their national responsibilities. In this way, the country cannot be strong and the nation cannot be revived. If we want the country to be strong and the nation to be revived, we must first make the people's physique strong. As for the methods of forging a physique, there are of course many. Now I can put forward a most important principle, which is to fight against the three companions of nature: "sunlight, air, and water." Whether we are educating children at home, educating students at school, or educating soldiers in the army, we must lead by example and make them fight against these three things "sunlight, air, and water" at all times. We must continuously fight against various harsh climates such as severe cold, hot summer, strong winds, heavy rain, frost, and snow to forge our physique. Ordinary people are afraid of heat in hot weather and afraid of cold in winter. They are afraid of being exposed to the hot sun in the hot sun and afraid of getting wet and cold in heavy rain and snow. They dare not go out to work. This is simply being conquered by nature. We must overcome nature. The colder and hotter it is, the more we must go out to work. The stronger the wind and snow, the more excited and hardworking we must be. If we cannot control these three things, sunlight, air, and water, we will be controlled by them. This kind of person will not have any achievements. All ambitious people, no matter how cold or hot the weather is, how strong the sunlight is, or how heavy the rain and snow are, always fight against them. In this way, they will definitely be able to overcome them, forge a physique of bronze muscles and iron bones, and be able to stand tall and achieve success. However, now not only general literary schools do not pay attention to this important method of forging the body, but even the army, which is generally regarded as specializing in martial arts, has not really done this. Since everyone does not know how to use this method to forge the body, the physique and spirit of our general people are weakening day by day. No wonder the country and nation are also declining day by day. Therefore, from now on, whether they are leaders in literature or martial arts, or in agriculture, industry, commerce, and academia, they must know that the first priority of teaching people is to forge their physique, so that it becomes stronger and stronger day by day. This is more important than any other thing or any other knowledge. Of course, if we want to make the general people physically strong, we must first make them quit all the bad habits that harm the body, such as opium and gambling. However, we must lead by example and explain to them that in order to survive and thrive in the world, one must first seek to be healthy, and make them fight against nature such as sunlight and water. Of course, they will not go back to smoking or gambling. We must always start teaching people with this kind of forging of the physique, and then we can teach other knowledge and morality. We must also have a strong physique in order to exert all our intelligence and talents to take on major tasks for the society and the country. The above is about forging a physique with the best method. Martial arts can not only forge a physique, but it is also an indispensable skill for protecting the country and defending the people. Now not only literati do not understand martial arts, but to be honest, even general warriors do not understand martial arts. Although they wear military hats and military uniforms, and formally look like soldiers, they not only do not understand literary affairs, but they do not even understand the principles of martial arts. In the eyes of foreigners, they are all nondescript, neither literary nor military, and half-dead people. What is "martial arts" that I am talking about? It not only refers to techniques such as shooting guns and cannons, but the most important thing is the spirit of applying martial arts, that is, the martial virtues of wisdom, faith, benevolence, courage, and strictness, as the ancients called them. We, as warriors, must be equipped with "resourcefulness," "trustworthiness," "benevolence," "courage," and "strictness" in order to be considered true warriors. If we only know a little bit of techniques such as shooting guns and cannons, but do not have martial virtues, this is only barbarism and cannot be considered understanding martial arts. This kind of person is a fake warrior who harms the country and the people. We wear military hats, military uniforms, and are warriors. It is absolutely not enough to just know how to use martial arts and be able to fight. We must have martial virtues and fulfill our duty to protect the country and defend the people. Only in this way can we become true warriors and true complete people. The general people will love and support this kind of warrior, and will never have any aversion to them. Why do the general people despise our soldiers now? It is because the general soldiers, although they wear military hats and military uniforms, do not know martial virtues and do not know how to fulfill the responsibilities of soldiers for the country and the people. They are completely fake warriors, not true warriors. Why does our country lack true warriors so much? It is because the people who were responsible for military education in the past did not understand the principles of being warriors, so they could not teach the general students or subordinates well. From the time general students enter military academies to the time they graduate, and from the time general troops enter the army for training to the time they are able to fight, they are only taught a little bit of martial arts, and martial virtues are not taught at the same time, and the entire martial arts are not passed on to them. Therefore, they cannot promote the true spirit of soldiers and create the true strength of soldiers to protect the country and defend the people, which has led the country to such a critical state of survival. Therefore, if we want to be upright and honorable soldiers in the universe, we must first have martial virtues. Therefore, I hope that leaders from all walks of life, whether teaching children, teaching students, or teaching subordinates, should pay attention to this point. If we want to make them modern citizens, they must have martial arts. If we want to have martial arts, we must first have martial virtues. If everyone can promote martial virtues and increase martial arts, then there is no reason why the country and nation cannot turn from weak to strong and from danger to safety. Secondly, when it comes to the main content of education, the ancients educated students in the so-called six arts of ritual, music, archery, charioteering, writing, and mathematics. From this, it can be seen that the education of our ancient China was originally a combination of civil and military affairs and a cultivation of both skills and virtues. Now, most people think that literary schools only teach literary affairs and do not teach martial arts, which is completely wrong. In the future, school education should still be based on the ancient spirit of "combining civil and military affairs" and the principle of "cultivating the six arts," but the content of education should be enriched and advanced. Because the six arts that the ancients spoke of are actually the basic qualities and skills that modern citizens must possess. At the beginning of students and soldiers entering school or joining the army, these subjects should be used to teach them. These subjects can be learned by anyone. The so-called "ritual" is to summarize all reasonable attitudes and rules for conducting oneself and dealing with others. It does not specifically refer to bowing and raising hands in a narrow sense. These ordinary rituals can only be regarded as small rituals. What we mean is that whether we are eating, living, speaking, or acting, we must have rules and order at all times. Our lives for twenty-four hours a day are all within the bounds of ritual. If we do not observe ritual for a moment, families, schools, armies, and even the society and the country will be in chaos. Therefore, the ancients said, "Ritual is the governance of things," and also said, "Ritual is the foundation." From this, it can be seen the importance of ritual. Now, most people do not understand this important principle and think that preaching ritual education is a legacy of the feudal system and is not suitable for modern times. They do not know that ritual is the fundamental condition for establishing oneself and dealing with the world. Whether in ancient or modern times, at home or abroad, it cannot be separated for a moment. If school teachers or army officers do not educate their students or subordinates with ritual, they will become rude and lawless people. Not only will they themselves not be able to become talented and be good people, but the society and the country will also suffer their harm. Everyone should know that the standard of civilization of a person to a country is how well their people follow ritual and how well they follow the law. Now, foreigners scold us for not being a modern country, which means that our general people do not value ritual, do not abide by the law, have no order, and have no organization. In fact, as long as those of us who are responsible for education can lead by example and pay attention to education, ritual is something that people can know and that everyone can easily practice. For example, when students first enter school, they are taught to respect teachers and love classmates in school, to respect parents and love siblings at home, and to respect elders and love compatriots in society, wherever they go, to have etiquette and observe order. There is nothing they do not understand in these things, and there is nothing they cannot do when they understand them. Whether we are teaching students or teaching soldiers, we must first teach them the most important and easy-to-know and easy-to-practice principles. The "ritual" we are talking about now is the most important and easy-to-know and easy-to-practice principle. If everyone can use ritual as a teaching method, they can make all those who are taught successful and honorable modern citizens. The so-called "music" is music. Good music can cultivate temperament, invigorate the spirit, comfort labor, and harmonize the mind, making people's lives smooth and their interests beautiful, and invisibly cultivating personal personality and pure social customs. Its importance is not only related to the cultivation of personal morality, but also affects the rise and fall of society and the country. If a person does not have musical cultivation, their life is often easily dry and extreme, and instability, chaos, or even chaos can arise from this. Conversely, if we have musical cultivation, we can be comforted when we are bored, and we can turn to peace and solemnity when we are noisy and disturbed. Sad people can be turned into happy people, violent people can be turned into gentle people, and depressed people can be suddenly excited. From this, it can be seen that the function of music is very important. If a person does not understand music, they will not know the occasion for joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness, and cannot achieve a perfect life. If a school, army, or society and country does not have music, it cannot be a perfect school, army, or society and country. Especially for the army, music is the most important. We usually need to harmonize the military's mind, align the steps, unite the spirit, and in wartime, we need to comfort the tired, inspire morale, and boost the military's prestige, all of which depend on military music. When I was suppressing bandits in Jiangxi, I compiled a song for suppressing bandits, and this song had a great effect. Therefore, you general senior generals must pay special attention to military music and military songs. Roughly speaking, the first element of music is to require harmony. The pitch, intensity, length, and shortness of the rhythm must be neat and in accordance with the rhythm and beat to play the role of music. Today, the tone of everyone's party song is not harmonious. Everyone is a leader from all walks of life, and they still sing so unevenly, which is really something that should not happen. Everyone should pay attention to improving in the future, and they must teach their students and subordinates to understand music, so that they can become all-rounders in the future. We humans all have musical talent. Even a three-year-old child, if we teach them to sing, they will sing. So anyone can do it. Now our society does not pay much attention to music. Except for music majors in schools, general teachers and students do not pay attention to music. Now that we understand that music has such a significant relationship with people's hearts and customs and with society and the country, we must vigorously promote it in the future. The so-called "archery" in ancient times was archery, which was a martial art that everyone had to learn. And they often held grand archery ceremonies. When the archery ceremony was held, it was a very glorious thing for the person who could hit the target. The ancients said, "A gentleman has nothing to compete for, but archery. He yields and ascends, and drinks when he descends. His competition is gentlemanly." From this, it can be seen that the ancients attached great importance to archery, and the essence of archery can also be seen from this. The so-called archery refers to archery. Now that guns and cannons have been invented, the word archery also refers to shooting. The cultivation of this skill is very important for the people's morality, people's wisdom, and the rise and fall of society and the country. Now there is shooting everywhere abroad. People from families, schools, armies, and various institutions participate in this organization. Both men and women can shoot. Looking back at our general people, not only can they not shoot, but they have never even seen it. In today's world, the people are so lacking in this important cultivation. How can they be modern citizens and not be invaded and oppressed by others? Therefore, everyone must know the importance of shooting and vigorously promote it, so that shooting associations can be organized everywhere, and the general people can master the art of shooting to protect the country and defend the people. The so-called "charioteering" is about riding horses and driving carriages. Now many people think that this is a very lowly thing. They do not know that this is also a skill that the ancients valued very much. For example, Confucius' students often held whips and drove carriages for the elders. In ancient China, many children drove carriages for their parents and teachers. Both literati and warriors could ride horses and practice martial arts. Now everyone does not do these things, and they do not even mention them. Not only do they not drive carriages for their parents and elders, but many children still ask their parents and brothers to carry their luggage when they go out to study. Are these people still considered polite? Now that airplanes and cars have been invented, driving airplanes and cars is also called charioteering. Although the tools and technologies have changed, the meaning and importance of "charioteering" remain the same. Everyone should know that "charioteering" is the principle of driving and controlling things. In a broad sense, it can include all of human intelligence. In a narrow sense, it specifically refers to the driving of moving tools, which is also a necessary skill for modern citizens, especially soldiers. Therefore, everyone should not think that "charioteering" is a lowly thing, but should pay attention to using it to educate general students and subordinates. In addition, the so-called "writing" and "mathematics," "writing" refers to writing and literature, and "mathematics" refers to mathematics, statistics, measurement, and various other skills related to mathematics. This is what general people know they should pay attention to. I do not need to talk much about it now. In short, the six arts of ritual, music, archery, charioteering, writing, and mathematics are the important content of education that combines civil and military affairs, and they are also the indispensable skills of a modern country. All those who are responsible for teaching students and subordinates, if they do not teach people with these six arts, so that the educated people become talents, they cannot be considered complete teachers. To be a model teacher, they must have considerable cultivation in all six arts, and they must teach the principles of the six arts to the general educated people at the same time. They must teach the corresponding skills according to the degree of the educated people and the principle of emphasizing all six arts. We must all understand ritual and music, practice archery and charioteering, and master writing and mathematics. We should not regard this as a specialized academic skill. We must know that the six arts are something that everyone can know and everyone should learn. In the future, if we want to make the general students and subordinates become sound talents and build a modern country, we must implement education that combines civil and military affairs and cultivates both skills and virtues. Today, all the comrades here have the responsibility of teaching people. Therefore, today I specially tell you the principles of teaching people. From now on, everyone should know that if we want to be able to teach the general students and subordinates, and even the general people, to become talents, first, we must make them fight against nature to forge their physique; second, we must teach them the martial virtues of wisdom, faith, benevolence, courage, and strictness; and third, all education must take the six arts of ritual, music, archery, charioteering, writing, and mathematics as its main content. The fundamental spirit of the New Life Movement that I advocate is propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame can be connected with wisdom, faith, benevolence, courage, and strictness, which is the fundamental spirit of the six arts. Therefore, if we want to implement education that combines civil and military affairs, the most practical point is to strive to promote the New Life Movement. Today, I take this opportunity to tell everyone the methods of teaching people. If everyone can follow this meaning and work tirelessly, not only will education in Sichuan achieve twice the result with half the effort, and the social atmosphere in Sichuan can be thriving, but also the future of the entire country and nation will be infinitely bright."

<p>The Wanyuan Money Shop, located south of the Shengxiang Bridge in the city, was established by Chen Yitang as his sole proprietorship and has been in business for more than ten years. Its business scope includes small loans, public bond treasury bills, purchase of unpaid yarn coupons from various places, and sales of various prize-winning securities. Its business was considered to be quite developed. In recent years, Chen suffered repeated failures due to speculative business operations and was also affected by the market downturn, resulting in internal emptiness and poor turnover.

<p>Qin Mingyuan, a local vendor from Meili Township in this county, died suddenly after being searched by Liu Chunnan and other anti-opium association investigators. He died within two hours of being detained. The county autopsy determined that he had committed suicide by poisoning to escape punishment. However, Qin's relatives, including his wife Gui and sister Wu Qin, claimed that the deceased had no opportunity to take poison and accused the investigators of extortion and fatal assault. They requested a second autopsy. The Jiangsu High Court dispatched coroner Xuan Fang to Changshu, and the exhumation took place on the 21st at Zhua Pa Wan outside the North Gate. More than ten thousand men and women attended as spectators. County Magistrate Zhai Huan also personally attended the site to supervise the examination. The examination began at 2:00 PM that day. However, due to the decomposition of the body, it was impossible to determine whether he had taken poison or suffered injuries. It was decided to perform a bone examination. At that moment, the deceased's sister, Wu Qin, seeing the dark face and decaying flesh of the deceased, fainted and collapsed, losing all pulse. It nearly resulted in another fatality. Wu Qin pleaded with the County Magistrate to send her to a certain hospital for treatment. After two injections of cardiac stimulant, she gradually recovered. She then cried loudly. As the bone steaming could not be completed in a short time, it was postponed to the morning of the second day. The truth may be revealed by the evening.</p>

Director Wu presided over the meeting. First, Zhao Jinqing, chairman of the first group that reviewed the proposals, and Ding Chungao, chairman of the second group, reported on the review process. Then, they discussed the proposals separately and adjourned at 1:30 PM.</p>
<p>Resolutions Passed</p>
<p>The resolutions of the General Meeting for the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Conference are as follows: (1) To strictly determine quotas and vigorously implement performance assessments. (2) To implement both rewards and punishments to rectify tax collection. The above two proposals were discussed together and resolved to pass in accordance with the original proposals. However, the revision of the budget range was changed to be based on the actual collection of each provincial branch bureau in the past three years as the warp, and the recent local production and sales situation and the current collection system as the weft. (3) To implement a contracting system for tobacco and alcohol tax to ensure tax revenue. (4) To fix quotas and restrict collection and delivery with reference to the election committee method to increase tax revenue. The above two proposals were discussed together and resolved to be reserved. (4) The quota of tobacco and alcohol tax in Shandong Province should be allocated according to peak and off-peak months. (5) To set up bureaus by region to facilitate organization. (6) Starting from the 22nd year (of the Republic), the local tobacco tax of Deng County, Xichuan, and other counties should still be collected by the Henan Bureau to clarify jurisdiction and facilitate organization. For the above three proposals, it was resolved that the original proposing provinces should submit special requests for approval. (7) To request that the provincial bureaus prepare tables of the quotas and actual deliveries of each sub-bureau and request the supervisors and staff to submit them in advance. It was resolved to pass in accordance with the original proposal. (8) Which types of alcohol can be changed to a single collection method? It was resolved to pass in principle. Trial implementation will begin in Jiangsu (Taixing, Taixian, Suzhou Hengjing, etc.) for local brews, Hubei (Hanfen), and Zhejiang (Shaojiu). The department will formulate a method and implement it on a regular basis. (9) The tobacco and alcohol tax and fees in Shandong Province should be collected under the same name. (10) To unify tobacco and alcohol prices to maintain commerce and increase tax revenue. (11) To formulate measures for organizing the collection of tobacco and alcohol tax to increase tax revenue. For the above three proposals, it was resolved that the original proposing provinces should submit special requests for approval. (12) To hold a tobacco and alcohol merchant registration in Anhui Province. It was resolved that the regulations on the fixed tax for local alcohol in the Tobacco and Alcohol Merchant Regulations already have provisions. The provincial bureaus can follow the regulations to implement them properly. There is no need to set up a separate organization. (13) To levy taxes separately on duty-paid tobacco leaves that are made into tobacco shreds for non-cigarette use. (14) To change the special tobacco leaf tax to a tax on tobacco shreds. For the above two proposals, it was resolved that the Taxation Department would send them to the provincial bureaus for review. (15) To propose a new tax rate for local tobacco leaves in Anhui Province. It was resolved that the original proposing province should submit a special request for approval. (16) The fixed tax payment and zero-catty duty-paid certificates for local tobacco will be implemented within the next year. (17) Local tobacco should be changed to a fixed tax certificate to facilitate verification. For the above two proposals, it was resolved that the Taxation Department would send the original proposals to the provincial bureaus for review before implementing them. (18) To request a redesign of the duty-paid certificate. It was resolved to pass in principle. The Taxation Department is requested to consider modifications. (19) To prohibit alcohol from being used as a beverage to protect the livelihoods of brewing households. It was resolved to pass in accordance with the original proposal. The Ministry will submit it to the Executive Yuan and hand it over to the competent authorities for review of the measures. (20) To increase the expenses of each sub-bureau. (21) To increase the expenses of each tobacco and alcohol sub-bureau in each district, verify and fill in the licenses to facilitate progress. The above two proposals were discussed together and resolved to provide reasons in principle, but since the national treasury is currently stretched, it should be postponed for further discussion. (22) For the excess amount of tobacco and alcohol tax collected by each sub-bureau, in addition to the 16% commission expense that should be paid, an incremental commission will be used to encourage it. (23) To request the department to stipulate an annual collection bonus method for branch bureau chiefs of tobacco and alcohol inspection and local tobacco special tax to encourage it. The above two proposals were discussed together and resolved to take the provincial bureau's total budget as the standard for awarding bonuses for exceeding the quota. Since the expenses of the branch bureau are already difficult, in order to ensure that the provincial bureaus seriously reorganize, at the end of each year, if the amount of tax collected and delivered by the provincial bureau exceeds the quota set by the Ministry, in addition to the expenses being paid, it is proposed that the Ministry approve the extraction of 20% of the surplus as a bonus to be allocated by the competent provincial bureau for encouragement. (24) To specifically set up inspectors to strictly enforce the pasting of alcohol duty-paid stamps and local tobacco print certificates and prevent the mutual circulation of various branch bureaus. It was resolved that this case is an essential plan at present and can be handled according to the original proposal. (25) To seriously investigate and handle control cases. It was resolved that control cases are related to the rights of merchants and the quality of tax administration. It should be thoroughly investigated. Moreover, in recent years, merchants' control cases have often been submitted to the Control Yuan and the Executive Yuan. It should be seriously investigated so that the Ministry can truthfully reply. This case can be handled according to the original proposal. However, the control procedure should be handled in accordance with the methods promulgated by the Xingying (Northwest Suppression Headquarters). (26) To request all provinces to assist in anti-smuggling. It was resolved that the tobacco and alcohol tax bureaus of each province belong to the national tax authorities and originally have no distinction between each other. They should cooperate fully and assist in contact at any time to connect and prevent evasion. It is proposed that the Ministry of Finance issue an order to all bureaus to investigate and handle it. (27) To request the Ministry to consult the provincial governments of each province to include the officials of the county magistrates who assist the tax authorities in the county magistrate's performance appraisal. (28) To clearly stipulate the reward methods for local officials who have effectively assisted in the collection of tobacco and alcohol taxes and the penalty regulations for tax evasion and promulgate them as soon as possible. The above two proposals were discussed together and resolved to include the county magistrate's assistance in the performance appraisal and to clearly stipulate the reward methods. It is proposed that the Ministry of Finance consult with the Ministry of Interior to handle it. (29) To request the training of tax police to eliminate long-standing malpractices and benefit inspection and collection. It was resolved that the patrol situation varies from province to province. The Taxation Department is planning a whole anti-smuggling method and plans to compile a unified tax police. The case of the Hubei Bureau's plan to compile tax police can be submitted to the Ministry for approval by the Hubei Bureau. (30) To strictly implement spot checks and re-examinations of tobacco and alcohol license taxes in accordance with regulations to re-emphasize tax revenue. It was resolved that the spot checks and re-examinations of license taxes by the provincial tobacco bureaus are the regulations of the Provisional Regulations and Implementation Rules for Tobacco and Alcohol Business License Taxes. It should be handled in accordance with the regulations. However, it should be requested that the Ministry first consult with the provincial governments of each province to order the finance departments to send the register of license taxes collected by each county to the Ministry so that it can order the bureaus to conduct spot checks. For the re-examination section, it can be requested that the Ministry of Finance consult with the provincial governments to order the departments to handle it in accordance with the regulations. (31) To request to modify the penalty rules for fixed local alcohol tax. It was resolved that the original proposal's first, second, fourth, and fifth four items should be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for consideration and adoption when revising the regulations. The third item, if the merchant submits an inconsistent transportation license, it should be investigated and dealt with in accordance with the regulations if it is intentional. If it is an unintentional mistake, it can be exempted from discussion. The regulations in the original regulations on penalty regulations that include inconsistent cargo certificates or transportation licenses and re-transportation certificate are broad and difficult to cancel. The sixth item, the method of supplementing tax and punishing tobacco and alcohol that are smuggled into other provinces, Article 29 of the Jiangsu Alcohol Fixed Tax Implementation Rules is very clear. Each province can stipulate it in the detailed rules of each province. For those who have evaded production tax and those who have evaded sales tax, they should be supplemented separately. However, the penalty can only be imposed concurrently and cannot be imposed separately. The scope of the seventh item of the original proposal seems too broad. If each province encounters tax evasion cases that are not stipulated in the regulations, it may propose methods for handling special cases and report them to the Ministry for approval and the Ministry will issue an order to the provincial bureaus to handle them with reference to them. (32) To change the fine rules to benefit tax revenue. It was resolved that Article 37 of the Local Alcohol Fixed Tax Inspection Regulations stipulates that the confiscated and priced items will be released from the treasury, half of which will be divided into ten shares, and the informant will receive four shares. All fines will be divided into ten shares, and the informant will receive four shares, which is better for rewarding. Shandong Province and other provinces that have not handled fixed tax can handle it with reference to it. It is proposed that the Ministry of Finance issue an order to comply. (34) To request the Ministry to dispatch agricultural technology experts to the tobacco-producing areas to seek all improvements. It was resolved to suggest that the Ministry of Finance handle it appropriately. (35) To form an organization jointly by officials and merchants to lend money to rural areas, improve tobacco seeds, and lend money to brewers and tobacco merchants to advance the purchase of brewing materials and tobacco leaves to benefit production. It was resolved to suggest that the Ministry of Finance hand it over to the provincial bureaus to draft opinions and report for review.</p>

<p>After the proposals submitted by the Taxation Department and the provincial bureau chiefs are passed by yesterday's general meeting, they will be implemented separately.

The most important are the proposal by consultant Wang Yansong to establish an Industrial and Commercial Revitalization Committee to investigate the actual situation of industry and commerce, study revitalization plans, and the proposal by supervisor Luo Qinghua to petition the government to control import trade and manage international exchange rates to prevent import surpluses and safeguard the national foundation. These will be the focus of the assembly's discussions. The original text of the two proposals is recorded below: (1) Mr. Wang Yansong's proposal states: "Since the outflow of silver and the contraction of currency, credit has declined daily, and all industries have suffered. The financial sector lacks the means to circulate funds, and industry and commerce are at a loss. Shanghai, located in the economic and industrial center of the country, is more severely affected than other places. In the past six months, dangerous situations have occurred frequently, and bankruptcies have followed one after another. The perilous situation cannot be ignored. In terms of the current situation in the financial sector, what was once called a shortage of chips has now become a phenomenon of credit disappearance. What was once difficult to circulate and transfer has now become a fact of liquidation and bankruptcy. Although the government has allocated 2.5 million yuan in financial bonds to help overcome the current difficulties, temporary relief cannot compensate for the future circulation of funds in the banking industry. The effect of the allocation is only enough to prolong life. As for the current situation in industry and commerce, the unemployed masses are everywhere. Everything seen and heard, and reported in newspapers, is filled with panic about the severity of the situation, and there is a desire for effective relief from the government. The whole country is in a state of panic and doesn't know what to do. However, after investigating the truth, the extent of the industrial and commercial decline and the crux of the problem have never been thoroughly investigated or analyzed in detail for reference. Other groups are not to blame, but even the industry and commerce themselves, who are suffering, can only sit and wait for death while shouting and clamoring. Speaking of decline in this way is no different from the clamor of the blind. Speaking of revitalization in this way is no different from climbing a tree to catch a fish. It is impossible to prescribe the right medicine to revive and save the situation. Shanghai is the essence of the country's industry and commerce, and this Chamber of Commerce is the highest representative body of Shanghai's industry and commerce. It should have a detailed and clear path for the current decline of various industries. I dare not presume to be foolish and propose the establishment of an Industrial and Commercial Revitalization Committee, inviting economic experts from all parties and extending invitations to leaders of industrial and commercial enterprises to gather together and jointly devise remedies. The result will be to provide guidance for various industries to respond and to provide the government with corresponding choices. I respectfully request that representatives from various industries carefully consider and then decide on the principle of establishing the committee and submit it to the executive committee for prompt implementation to witness its success. Industry and commerce will be fortunate, and the country will be fortunate. Is this appropriate? I respectfully await your decision." (2) Mr. Luo Qinghua's proposal states: "I have investigated that since the records of foreign trade in our country, there has been an import surplus every year, and the number is often between 200 and 300 million customs taels. In the past, we relied on remittances from overseas Chinese, foreign investment, and other intangible income to offset the deficit and make up for the temporary shortage. However, since the wave of the world economic panic in 1929 began to counterattack the globe, all industrialized countries have fallen into the heavy group of overproduction and increasing unemployment. As a result, 'economic nationalism' prevailed internationally for a time. In order to maintain their own domestic markets, countries have built high tariff barriers to restrict the import of foreign goods. In order to expand overseas markets, they have also used monetary policies to implement foreign dumping, scheming against each other and competing for consumer markets. Our country, with its underdeveloped industry and backward production, is not self-sufficient and has become the tail end of foreign dumping. In addition, years of disasters have arrived, and agricultural production has been poor. Large quantities of people's food rely on foreign imports, resulting in a sharp decline in exports and a sharp increase in imports. The import surplus figures have become even larger. Turning through the customs trade records for the past six years, we know that the import surplus in 1929 was only more than 390 million yuan. By 1930, it suddenly increased to more than 647 million yuan. By 1931, it increased even more sharply to more than 818 million yuan, an increase of more than twice that of the previous eight years. In 1932, due to the large-scale import of foreign rice and wheat, the import surplus figures soared even higher, creating a record of more than 866 million yuan. Although there was a slight decrease in 1933, the number was still as high as more than 733 million yuan. Last year, due to the extreme weakness of domestic consumption and the continued decline in the exchange rate of foreign currencies, both imports and exports declined. The total amount of foreign trade was 1,564,897,503 yuan, of which imports amounted to 1,029,665,224 yuan and exports amounted to 535,214,279 yuan. After offsetting the imports and exports, the annual import surplus was 494,450,945 yuan. As for the trade situation in the first quarter of this year, from January to April, the total amount of foreign trade was 535,155,245 yuan, of which the net value of imports was 357,796,813 yuan and the net value of exports was 177,358,432 yuan. After offsetting the imports and exports, the import surplus was 180,438,381 yuan. The trade deficit for the past six years is unknown in the thousands of billions. The continued continuation of this trade reversal is the greatest underlying cause of the huge outflow of silver. If we do not seek remedies urgently, the day when domestic silver is exhausted will be the time when the entire people's economy goes bankrupt. Thinking about the future of the country, how can we not be terrified? The only ways to balance international trade are to increase exports and reduce imports. Since our country is backward in production and silver prices are high, we cannot imitate other countries and implement foreign dumping. Therefore, in addition to encouraging exporters to export local products as much as possible within a possible range, the only way to offset the trade deficit is to reduce the number of imports of goods. A detailed examination of my country's imports last year shows that cotton textiles, miscellaneous grains, oil candles, machinery, and metals were the largest. Transportation equipment, sugar, tobacco, chemical products, dyes, and pigments were the second largest. The import situation in the first quarter of this year is roughly the same, with rice ranking first, followed by hardware, followed by machine tools, wheat, cotton, wood, dyes and pigments, chemical products, sugar, paper, transportation equipment, cotton cloth, kerosene, and gasoline. Among them, in addition to productive products such as machinery and transportation equipment, the remaining types of imported goods can either be sought domestically, or their quantity can be reduced, or their import can be prohibited. There is room for flexibility in the amount of imports. All countries in the world have already implemented controls on import trade. Moreover, as the country is backward in production and not as good as others in everything, there is even more need to manage it. However, controlling import trade is not only related to the country's economic structure, but also involves foreign trade relations. It cannot be implemented immediately unless the government comes forward to preside over it. The Association is the highest leading body of the entire Shanghai industrial and commercial sector. It should take the interests of the country as the premise and suggest that the government authorities specially establish an import and export trade control agency, or order other competent authorities to select appropriate control methods to implement the management of import and export trade. At the same time, in order to strengthen the power of control, the Central Bank should be authorized to manage international exchange rates and stabilize foreign exchange rates, so as to prevent the outflow of domestic capital, avoid the dumping of exchange rates by various countries, so that the endangered national foundation will not suffer more harm, and the national industry may gradually develop. Benefiting the country and the people are all supported by this. Is this appropriate? I respectfully await your decision."</p>

<h3 id="e122">The Directorate General of Telecommunications Notifies Free Inquiries about Ambiguous Telegrams Relief for Telegram Errors <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau received a letter from the Department of Transportation and Communications stating: "When the recipient of a telegram has doubts about the telegram or believes that there is an error, they should, according to regulations, inquire with the receiving bureau. If there is no error on the part of the receiving bureau, they may use a public telegram to inquire with the sending bureau and notify the recipient of the result. This method was originally set up to provide relief for telegram errors. However, in fact, recipients often do not know how to use this method, or allow the error to stand, and are deeply dissatisfied afterwards, or directly send a telegram to the sender to inquire. If it is found that the error was made by the telegraph bureau, they will request a refund of the round-trip inquiry fees. After the telegraph bureau refuses according to regulations, misunderstandings arise again. Both of the above situations have a significant impact on business reputation. In order to improve the situation, the following two measures are now established: (1) Bureaus with business inspectors should have these inspectors explain the benefits of free telegram inquiries to each sending and receiving user at any time, so that telegram efficiency can be fully realized and business reputation can be increased. (2) If receiving operators in each bureau encounter a recipient who does not understand how to inquire about ambiguous characters and directly sends a telegram to the sender to inquire, or if the sender receives a telegram from the recipient and directly sends a telegram to reply, they should tactfully inform them of the detailed method of inquiring with the telegraph bureau for free, without having to send a telegram themselves, so as to avoid requesting a refund afterwards and causing misunderstandings. Please follow these instructions."</p>

It is now heard that there are more than 700 schools that have reported to the headquarters for record and are carrying out preparations. More than 200 schools have been officially established and have begun classes as of yesterday. The rest can be established within one or two days. All textbooks used by the schools are divided into two volumes, upper and lower, and are scheduled to be read in two months. Therefore, even on Sundays, the schools must hold classes as usual, otherwise they will not be able to complete the courses on time. It is also learned that most of the literacy schools run by the municipal Party headquarters on behalf of various social organizations have been established, and the school signs have also been made. Those who have received the school signs can claim them from the municipal Party headquarters.

<p>The Shanghai Office of the China Aviation Association Mobilization Team convened a meeting at 3:00 PM on the 21st, on the ninth floor of the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge, to discuss fundraising with representatives from the city's dance hall industry. Attendees included Wang Xinhe and Zhou Shihun from the St. Anna Dance Hall, Gu Shiqi from the Dahua Xinhua Dahua Garden Company, Yan Bingxian from the Vienna Dance Hall, Hu Wenhui from the Dadong Dance Hall, Chen Weifang from the Lafayette Dance Hall, Ye Changgen from the Liangyou Dance Hall, Zhu Panjin and Li Yaosheng from the Xiaoyao Dance Hall, Gao Shouyu from the Hongkou Dance Hall, Yue Gen from the Shengli Dance Hall, Liu Genshen from the Dalu Dance Hall, and Pan Xunzhi, Wang Kan, and Zhang Zhongkun from the Yuegong, Shunfeng, Laodahua, and Nightclub representatives. Also present were Li Dachao, Chief Secretary of the Mobilization Team Office, and Secretaries Zhang Yuliang, Chen Shuo, Lu Zhangyan, and Li Wenyao. Chief Secretary Li chaired the meeting, with Chen Shuo as the recorder. The chairman reported that the previous mobilization campaign in the city relied heavily on the support of various sectors, who contributed enthusiastically, resulting in excellent achievements. Various industries, based on their business income, have been collecting a 5% donation, including the hotel industry, fresh meat industry, fresh pork vending industry, freight car industry, brick and ash industry, brick and tile transportation industry, and sand and gravel industry. These initiatives have progressed smoothly. A letter was previously sent regarding the collection of donations from the dance hall industry, and various dance halls expressed their support. Today, everyone was convened to discuss the implementation and exchange ideas. The dance hall business in the city is quite extensive, and if assistance is provided, the results will be considerable. Patrons should not be concerned about this small donation, which will not affect the dance hall business and will support the aviation mobilization campaign. It is hoped that everyone will make an effort and offer suggestions for joint discussion. Subsequently, representatives from the Dahua Company, St. Anna, Vienna, and Xiaoyao dance halls, including Gu Shiqi, Wang Xinhe, Yan Bingxian, and Li Yaosheng, successively expressed their opinions, stating that various industries have previously collected donations according to their business income, and this industry should follow suit to support the mobilization campaign. However, this industry differs from others, and collecting according to income standards would be very troublesome. It was requested that the process be simplified by selling tickets to customers entering the dance hall, which would save on procedures. Finally, after discussing the matters, it was decided on the spot: (1) A ticket will be sold to customers entering the dance hall at a price of one dime (大洋一角). There is no limit on the collection time or amount, which will be determined after a trial period. (2) Actively investigate the business conditions of each dance hall. (3) The Shanghai Office of the China Aviation Association Mobilization Team will dispatch several people, and each dance hall will nominate nine representatives to jointly form a committee to assist in the implementation. St. Anna, Vienna, Dahua, Lafayette, Dadong, Yangzi, Yuegong, Dahua, and Dadu will be nominated on the spot to form the committee with the Mobilization Team Office. The China Aviation Association will build a clubhouse and exhibition hall near the museum in the city center. Architect Dong Dayou, consultant of the City Center Construction Committee, was commissioned to design it, and bids were invited through newspaper advertisements. The bids were publicly opened on the 27th of the previous month at the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge, as reported in previous newspapers. It is heard that the executive board decided in a meeting to appoint directors Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Yao Xijiu, and Li Dachao to be responsible for the preparations. The association has also requested the Public Works Bureau to investigate the situation of construction companies and decided to have Jiutai Construction Company undertake the construction, which is estimated to cost 64,000 yuan. The contract was signed at the association a few days ago and construction will commence immediately.</p>

<p>According to Shiyeshe, the Shanghai Guohuo Company has been closed for more than a decade. Over two hundred employees, facing difficult living conditions, organized a relief association, sending representatives Yan Shoufu, Cai Juntang, Hu Qinglian, Zhou Bao, Yan Dinglun, and Chen Leguan to appeal for assistance from all sides and to request Hong Yanbin to implore Mr. Du Yuesheng to take charge, in order to enable the company to resume operations as soon as possible and maintain the livelihoods of the employees. Subsequently, after Mr. Du contacted various parties, he concluded that the company's debts were too large to be remedied, and the founder, Wu Zhihao, had left Shanghai for other places, making it difficult to intervene. Therefore, the prospect of resuming operations has become a pipe dream. Upon hearing the news, all employees were greatly alarmed. Yesterday, they specially sent representatives such as Yan Shoufu to negotiate with the company's liquidator, demanding payment of back wages for May and June, as well as severance pay, to enable them to return to their hometowns and seek a living. The company's attorney, Wang Jian, is currently investigating the amount of back wages owed to the employees and trying to find a solution.</p>

<p>Farmers' Speculation</p>
<p>Checking the seasonal timing, yesterday happened to be the Summer Solstice. Farmers speculate about the weather, saying, "If the southwest wind doesn't bring rain on the Summer Solstice, there will be few bridges," meaning that if there is rain with a westerly wind today, there will be plenty of rain this year. However, it is said that yesterday's rain was entirely caused by a low-pressure system from Jiangxi. Currently, it is an easterly wind, and if it turns to a westerly wind, it may clear up. Yesterday morning, the water level of the Huangpu River was 0.12 feet 4 inches at 8:00 AM, which is lower than the 13.2 feet on the 20th. This tide level needs to be reduced by 1.73 feet according to the Public Works Bureau's baseline.</p>
<p>Flights Suspended</p>
<p>The continuous rainy and foggy weather in this city has inevitably affected transportation. The Shanghai-Guangdong southbound flight of China National Aviation Corporation was not able to fly the day before yesterday due to weather conditions and was postponed to yesterday morning. However, due to the adverse weather, it was still unable to depart. The Shanghai-Beijing northbound flight was also affected by the weather yesterday morning and remained at Longhua Airport. It did not fly out in the afternoon. The Shanghai-Hankou westbound flight was delayed until 8:10 AM yesterday morning before departing from Shanghai.</p>
<p>Grain Prices Fall</p>
<p>After three heavy rains, this city has received 3.8 inches of rain. Therefore, the cotton and rice in the suburbs can fully recover because of this. According to market news, rice crops in various counties of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces have recovered in recent days, and a good autumn harvest can be expected. Yesterday, the price of rice fell by more than 2 dimes, with the highest price only around 12.5 yuan. The price of wheat was 3.4 yuan, and the price of flour was only 2.512 yuan. It is expected that prices will continue to fall in the coming days.</p>

<p>According to Shenshi News Agency, China's abundant products have always been renowned in the world. However, due to backward technology, it has been unable to find its own way out. The International Trade Bureau is making every effort to promote direct trade, emphasizing the advantages of China's products to the outside world and striving to support domestic producers. The bureau introduces domestic goods to foreign countries. The following is a detailed list of the domestic products recently needed by various countries, as announced by the bureau's guidance office:</p>
<p>Various Products</p>
<p>The Washington State of America, Qiumaerjun, needs magnetic butterfly brooches. These butterflies are made of magnetic material, painted in various colors, and lifelike, inlaid with beryllium metal edges and a bottom plate with a pin attached to be pinned on suit ties and women's hats as decorations. Glassford Brothers Company of Canada specializes in the import of small appliances and is now planning to trade with the manufacturer. Allen Company of the United States needs hair. The Nai Si Kai Leather Goods Company is willing to trade with leather goods merchants in Tianjin and Shanghai.</p>
<p>Promoting Domestic Products</p>
<p>Sun Zhengjun of London, on behalf of a trading company in India, requested American-style carpets, floral slippers, silk shirts, floral women's handkerchiefs, women's necklaces, and jewelry for direct trade. The Gu Ba Guo Mi Guan Da Company needs tablecloths, lace gold straw hats, etc. Qiumaerjun of the United States needs magnetic piggy banks. A certain company in this city needs 200 tons of green lead ore per month. The ore must be above 50 degrees and traded in Shanghai. Domestic lead mines are requested to send ore samples and prices to the International Trade Bureau. The bureau is willing to introduce manufacturers for direct foreign trade to benefit the promotion of domestic products.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Rong Zongjing Talks About the Xinkangzhuang Lawsuit <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>According to Central News Agency, Rong Zongjing, a magnate in China's cotton yarn and flour industry, mortgaged a warehouse receipt from Shenxin Third Cotton Mill in Wuxi to Xinkangzhuang (which went bankrupt on February 6 this year) in this city for 60,000 yuan and signed a mortgage contract. When the term expired, Rong had no funds to repay, so the principal sent a letter to Shenxin Third Cotton Mill in Wuxi according to the agreed terms, instructing them to hand over 400 bales of cotton yarn specified on the pledged warehouse receipt as collateral. Subsequently, the mill replied, requesting to continue contacting the original handler. Xinkangzhuang then filed a lawsuit with the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court in the name of shareholder Sun Bosheng, accusing Rong of fraud. The court hearing was held the day before yesterday. Rong did not attend, and the hearing was postponed to the afternoon of the 28th of this month. However, according to Rong, who spoke to the Central News Agency reporter, he has been doing business with Xinkangzhuang for more than 20 years and is also one of its shareholders (Xinkangzhuang has a capital of 300,000 yuan, of which Rong accounts for 60,000 yuan). Due to the failure to receive interest and principal over the years, the total has reached more than 200,000 yuan. Rong originally had 100,000 yuan in business dealings with the bank, which was purely a credit loan. At the end of the year before last, he repaid 41,000 yuan. On the eve of the abolished lunar New Year's Eve (ie, February 2), the paper was used as a guarantee and immediately handed over to the bank by Shenxin's accounting department (however, the warehouse receipt was not signed by Shenxin's general manager (ie, Rong)). Unexpectedly, Xinkangzhuang went bankrupt on February 6. The bank once contacted Rong to repay the loan, and Rong agreed to repay it in installments. Unexpectedly, Sun Bosheng suddenly filed a criminal fraud lawsuit. The reason why Shenxin Third Cotton Mill replied to the bank, requesting to contact the original handler, was because the headquarters did not notify the mills of various matters. Rong continued, stating that the reason why he did not appear in court the day before yesterday was because the plaintiff had expressed a willingness to settle and instructed him not to appear in court. Moreover, the plaintiff also said that he would no longer appear in court, which was actually a deception. Currently, Rong has hired lawyer Guo Shouyi to file a defense with the Special District Court, fundamentally requesting the dismissal of the plaintiff's fraud lawsuit. As for the issue of repaying the loan, it will be discussed after the lawsuit is over.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Someone Threw a Bomb at the Home of Famous Doctor Ding Jiwan; Six Letters Demanding Extortion of 50,000 Yuan; One Bandit Arrested While Arranging a Meeting <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Ding Jiwan, a descendant of the late famous doctor Ding Ganren, inherited his father's practice at No. 32, Lane 60, Baker Road, and his life was quite prosperous, attracting the attention of bandits. Since last month, he has been receiving threatening letters demanding 50,000 yuan. Ding initially ignored them, but the bandits dared to throw a real explosive bomb into his house through a window one evening. Ding's family was playing mahjong in the living room when they suddenly heard a loud explosion in the kitchen. Greatly shocked, they stopped playing mahjong and rushed to the kitchen to investigate. They saw iron fragments of the bomb scattered on the ground, the glass on the window was shattered, and the walls around the window were also covered with cracks, indicating the intensity of the bomb's explosive power. Fortunately, it was late at night, and the cook and kitchen maids had finished their work and were not in the kitchen, so no one was injured. However, after this incident, Ding became cautious and took the bomb fragments and the threatening letters he had received in recent days to the police station for investigation and requested an investigation. After throwing the bomb, the bandits thought that Ding might soften and continued to send letters to Ding demanding extortion. Ding used a ruse and pretended to agree to meet at 6:30 PM yesterday evening near the Guanghua Grand Theater on Edouard Road. Otherwise, he would report to the police station. The police chief sent detectives Ma Zhongrong and Ye Yushan disguised as vendors to the agreed location. At the appointed time, Ding sent his accountant Xiao Quan disguised to the location. As expected, a bandit named Xia Qingyuan came forward and was arrested by the disguised detectives Ma and Ye. He confessed that another accomplice, Li Sheng (also known as Wu Yongxing, nicknamed "Little Dongyang"), was hiding in Room 34 of the Huxi Hotel on Carter Road. The detectives then went to the address and arrested Wang. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Local Court. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu prosecuted them for extortion under Article 370, Section 1 of the Criminal Law and Article 1, Section 2 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits and explained the process of solving the case. The victim Ding Jiwan and his accountant Xiao Liquan went to court to clarify that they had received a total of six threatening letters and that the walls and windows were damaged by the bomb thrown by the bandits the night before. Judge Liu Yugui questioned Xia and Wang, and they confessed that they were formerly electricians and had the skills to make bombs. The bomb they threw was made by them, and the raw materials were purchased from pharmacies. However, the two bandits did not admit to writing the threatening letters. The court decided that the case required further investigation and ordered the defendants to be detained pending verification of the handwriting of the threatening letters before further trial.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Tianjin Major Fraud Case; Another Criminal Arrested in Shanghai; Fraudulently Obtained a Large Sum of Money from Chinese Merchants Under the Pretense of Releasing Gold from Warehouses <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The Russian, Po Laiwen, and his accomplices recently defrauded a large sum of money from Xu County in Tianjin. Po has already been arrested by the Tianjin authorities, and his accomplices fled to Shanghai. On the 20th of this month, the Public Concession General Inspectorate sent detectives to arrest the accomplices in the case, the Russian, Xi Huashi Ji, and the Russian woman, Ri Sha Huasha Wen. They were sent to the First Special District Local Court for questioning and detention. It is understood that the criminals in Tianjin used the excuse of investing in Russian gold to swindle the money from the Chinese merchants in Tianjin who were engaged in the sale of gold, collected the gold, and smuggled it elsewhere. The Russians then took the opportunity to sell Russian gold to the buyers. In fact, the Soviet Union strictly prohibits the outflow of gold. Even the small amount of gold needed for dental fillings must be applied for to the government for sale. How could their citizens be allowed to freely export large amounts of gold? The Chinese merchants who were selling gold only knew how to make profits and did not bother to consider the situation, so they fell for Po Laiwen's fraud. At that time, the Russian initially handed over a gold bar to the buyer for testing, and it was deemed to be of the appropriate fineness. After agreeing on the price, the Russians delivered a large number of gold bars, as many as thirty or fifty, to the buyer's location, and the test process was still satisfactory. Therefore, the transaction was completed. Unexpectedly, in that instant, the Russians quickly replaced the real gold with counterfeit gold and fled with the obtained gold price of 50,000 yuan in cash and 31,000 taels of silver in checks. When the buyer discovered that all the gold they had purchased was fake, they quickly reported it to the authorities. Po Laiwen was first found. According to his confession, his accomplices had all left Tianjin and fled to Shanghai. The Public Concession police station urgently telegraphed this city and subsequently arrested the two men and women. At 8:00 AM the day before yesterday, another person, Fu Kesi, was arrested by Xitan at No. 31, Taishan Lane, Shengmu Yuan Road. Fu is the brother-in-law of the Russian woman who was arrested a few days ago and is also heavily involved in the fraud case. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special Court. Judge Ping Shide brought him in for interrogation. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin briefly described the case and then requested an extension to jointly investigate with Xi Huashi Ji and others. Judge Ma questioned the defendant and ordered the defendant to pay a 3,000 yuan security deposit and change the case to a joint review.</p>

<p>Xuehua Creek in Pusan Town (also known as Beixinjing Town) in western Shanghai was originally a river channel that was more than a hundred feet long, located in the center of the town and running east-west. Recently, due to years of disrepair, it has become increasingly silted up, causing garbage to fill it up and emitting a foul odor that makes people want to vomit. Although the merchants in the town have dredged it themselves, it has still become silted up. Now that summer has arrived, it poses a significant health hazard. Because the creek does not have an important position, only due to water discharge problems, the merchants have repeatedly discussed and decided to fill in the river channel and build a large culvert underneath for water discharge. The necessary expenses will be covered by the sale of the filled-in land, which can also be used to widen the streets in the future. It is truly a win-win situation. They are currently working on the plan and will implement it soon.</p>

<p>Shen Miaosheng, a local resident, is 41 years old. He lives at No. 39 Chengqing Lane, Bair Road, Taiping Bridge, French Concession. He runs a tofu shop for a living. His wife, Lai, is about the same age as Shen. They have a son named Xiaomao, who is three years old this year. Last month, Xiaomao suddenly fell ill with measles. After seeing a doctor and taking medicine, he recovered. However, at the beginning of this month, the child's illness suddenly relapsed with chills and fever. The fever was very high and did not subside for a long time. The child's mother, Shen Lai, heard from a neighbor that there was an Immortal Hall at No. 11 Ziyang Lane, No. 64 Lafayette Road, that could cure illnesses. Taking their Immortal prescription was very effective. Lai, being a woman,</p>
<p>Lacking Knowledge</p>
<p>is usually very superstitious. She often heard people say that there was a Five Saints Bodhi Temple, and wealthy families often came by car to ask for Immortal prescriptions and burn incense. On the morning of the 3rd of this month, she took incense, candles, and ingots and went there piously to ask for an Immortal prescription. When she arrived, Lu Xiangtian, a Jiangbei Yancheng native who called himself an Immortal (nicknamed Xiaoliuzi, 34 years old), came out to greet her. He told her to quickly buy several walnuts in preparation for obtaining an Immortal pill. Lai immediately turned around and went out, bought twenty walnuts from a nearby dried goods store, and then went to the Immortal Hall to register, paying six jiao in small coins and ten copper coins, and handing over all the walnuts</p>
<p>To the Immortal</p>
<p>Lu Xiangtian held the walnuts in front of the Five Saints Bodhisattva and silently chanted a mantra. When Lai was not paying attention, he took out a walnut he had hidden in his sleeve and mixed it with the walnuts Lai had handed over. Unexpectedly, his technique was not skillful, and Lai saw it from the side. However, she still firmly believed that the Bodhisattva was efficacious and did not expose Lu's trick at the time. After Lu recited strange incantations, he picked out the walnut he had put in, smashed the shell with a hammer, and several pills made of incense ash rolled out. He handed them to Lai to take back and give to the child to swallow, saying that the illness would be cured immediately. Lai did not consider the consequences and took them home, giving them to her son as instructed. But</p>
<p>Her Son's Illness</p>
<p>not only did not improve, but worsened. Two days later, she went to the Immortal Hall again to beg the Immortal Lu Xiangtian to ask the Bodhisattva to save her son's illness. Lu took the opportunity to tell her to pay fifteen yuan in foreign currency to buy tin foil and sandalwood for praying to the gods. She paid the amount as requested. After several days, her son's illness still did not improve. On the 9th of this month, Lai went to beg for an Immortal pill again. Lu told her to buy a special, thicker incense stick for use. She went to all the incense and candle shops but could not find this special incense. She told Lu this, and Lu claimed that he had this kind of incense for sale, but it had mantras recited on it and required a fee of twenty yuan in foreign currency. At that time, Lai was anxious to cure her son's illness as soon as possible, so she ignored everything and</p>
<p>Did Not Guard Against Fraud</p>
<p>and paid the amount in full. Lu took the incense, lit it in front of the Buddha, and chanted incantations. When the incense burned to more than half, a pre-hidden mud pill fell out. Lu claimed that this pill was an Immortal pill bestowed by the Bodhisattva, picked it up, and handed it to Lai to take back and give to her son to swallow. However, her son, Xiaomao, had taken pills that had no effect several times and had not received proper medical treatment, so his illness became more dangerous. The child's father, Shen Miaosheng, learned that his wife was superstitious about clay and wood idols and had been defrauded of money, causing the illness to be delayed and not cured. He sent Xiaomao to the Red Cross for treatment and reported to the French Concession police, accusing Lu of scheming</p>
<p>To Defraud Money</p>
<p>and requesting an investigation. The police chief approved the request and sent detectives to the Immortal Hall at No. 11 Charity Lane on the afternoon of the day before yesterday to arrest the Immortal Lu Xiangtian. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special Second Court for questioning. After Judge Qiu Huan Ying asked the defendant about his age and place of origin, Lu stated that he was 34 years old, from Jiangbei, and lived at No. 11 Charity Lane. He owned a woodworking shop at No. 163 Dongzilaihuo Street and had not committed any crimes before. (According to records, Lu was accused of embezzling the money of a Buddhist nun last year and was beaten and injured when he demanded it back. He was detained by the French Concession police and sent to court. The result was an acquittal.) Yuan Jiahuan, a lawyer from the Police Department, stated that the defendant was detained on charges of fraud and obtaining property. The police had not yet investigated the case and requested that the</p>
<p>Defendant Be Detained</p>
<p>and the case be investigated at a later date. Then the plaintiff Shen Miaosheng testified about his wife being deceived due to their child's illness, and said that the child's condition was still dangerous and might not be saved, and he had hired a lawyer to represent him in the case and filed an attached civil suit. The judge listened to the testimony and told Shen, "This is because your own brains are too muddled in treating the illness. In this world, no one has died because of this." He then questioned the defendant Lu Xiangtian, who said that Shen's wife came to ask him to pray to the Bodhisattva on her behalf and he had not taken any money from her. He also hired lawyer Zhu Dianqing to defend him. The judge then told Lu, "You are praying to the Bodhisattva for people to cure illnesses. You must know that this is not saving people, but harming people!" At this point, the court adjourned the case to the 16th for further questioning and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody.</p>

<p>Qin Wu (also known as Shouquan), a notorious bandit from Shuyang, and his accomplices Xu Aizi (Fengjie), Jiang Yongsheng, Ding Zhaohuai, Yang Zhongshan, Wang Jinbiao, and Hu Daoyi, etc., committed murder, arson, kidnapping, and extortion in their hometowns. They fled to Shanghai. In the middle of last month, the Zhenjiang Garrison Headquarters sent personnel to Shanghai to work with the Public Security Bureau and the Public Concession Police to arrest Qin and other bandits. They were transferred to Zhenjiang for interrogation and trial. Jiang Futian, a detective supervisor, Zheng Zhulin, a chief detective, Zhang Daorong, a deputy detective, Wang Dongwan, Guo Shaorong, and other detectives from the French Concession Police also arrested</p>

<p>Han Jinmao (also known as Junmou, alias Zhang Yitang) and his brother Han Jinhua (alias Zhang Shaoting), natives of Shuyang, at No. 34 Xu Shilisha, Julai Road, at 0:30 a.m. on the 29th of the same month. They also rescued Xu Danshi, a young woman from Shuyang who had been kidnapped and forced into marriage by Han Jinmao. They continued to arrest seven other individuals: Wang Guanyi, Wang Shirong, and Hu Feihu and Jiang Guangyan from Anhui, who sold pistols to the Han bandits. After sending them to the Special Second Court for interrogation and detention, it was found that Wang Shirong and Jiang Guangyan were not involved in the case, and the court was petitioned for their release. Regarding the crimes committed by the Han bandits, because the investigation was not yet completed, an extension for questioning was requested. This has already been reported twice in this newspaper. When</p>
<p>The Han Bandits Were Arrested</p>
<p>Later, based on their confessions, detectives continued to arrest Zhang Dingshi (also known as Han Dingshi), the wife of Han Jinhua, and Jiang Yushi, the wife of Jiang Shuisheng, on Qi Qihar Road. More than 300 yuan in foreign currency was found on the two women. The detectives in charge of the case found that the Han bandits had confessed that Qin Wu, Wang Jinbiao, Yang Zhongshan, Jiang Yongsheng, and Zhong Xuecheng, who was shot and killed by a detective in Guangdong Road on May 20 while trying to rob a target, had participated in the robbery of Yitai Watch Shop at No. 615 Fade Road on February 18 of this year, obtaining 160 yuan in stolen goods. On March 18, they robbed Meifeng Silk Store at No. 424 Fade Road, obtaining 108 yuan in stolen goods. On March 29,</p>

<p>Rixin Sheng Foreign Goods Store at No. 160 Fade Road was robbed again, and 450 yuan in cash was found. They also forced the accountant to sign a check for 3,000 yuan, which they cashed at a money shop and fled. On April 20, Chunhuaqin Store at No. 28 Kaizier Road was robbed, obtaining 218 yuan in stolen goods and hats and shoes, etc., and fled. Detectives gathered the victims to the police station to identify the bandits' faces and submitted a request to the court to prepare a document and send detectives to the Zhenjiang Garrison Headquarters to transfer Wang Jinbiao, Yang Zhongshan, and Jiang Yongsheng, the accomplices who had been previously arrested and taken away, to Shanghai for interrogation and trial. However, the main criminal, Qin Jiu, was not</p>

<p>brought over because the circumstances were important. Zhong Xuezai, a Shuyang native, was also extradited from the Special First Court as a suspect and brought in for joint investigation. Several pieces of original stolen gray cloth, a top hat, and several watches were seized. A box cannon, which the bandits had abandoned and hidden in the wall of Yang Shupei's Seventh Lane, was also obtained from the Yulin Road Police Station (according to reports, the gun was discovered by Li Linhai, a resident of the area, and sent to the police station). The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhang Chaozuo of the Special Court, accompanied by clerk Gao Yanmao, sat in the First Criminal Court for interrogation. Gu Shouxi, a lawyer representing the Police Department, stated that the case was complex and the police investigation procedures were not yet complete. He requested that a later date be set so that the police could</p>
<p>Complete the Procedures</p>
<p>and then request a trial. The Zhenjiang Garrison Headquarters also prepared a document and sent four personnel to Shanghai to surrender the case, requesting that the defendants be transferred back for interrogation and trial. The court stated that the case had not yet been prosecuted by the Police Department, so it could not be transferred. It would have to wait until the Intermediate Court had concluded the trial and made a judgment before notifying them to come and take them away. The personnel then withdrew. The plaintiff Xu Danshi was not present because her child was ill and she was accompanying the child in Guangci Hospital. However, Danshi's mother commissioned lawyer Huang Xiubo to appear in court and requested that she be allowed to take her home. Representatives from the four victimized businesses, Yitaixiang, Wanfeng, Rixinsheng, and Chunhua, appeared in court and stated the circumstances of the robbery at that time. Detective Lu Zhulin reported on the investigation process and presented the seized stolen goods, silver coins, box cannons, etc., to the court. After verifying the report and questioning each defendant one by one, the court adjourned the case to the 29th for further questioning and ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Public Bus Driver and Ticket Seller in Zhabei Severely Beaten by Three Foreigners <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>According to a message from the China Business Public Bus Company, around 7:00 PM on the 21st of this month, China Business Company's Route 5, Bus No. 4936, was returning from the Municipal Government to the North Station when, upon arriving near the Kailin Company on West Tiyuhui Road, driver Gao Sanhou suddenly stopped the bus to avoid pedestrians in front of the vehicle. As a result, three foreigners in their private car, who were approaching from the opposite direction, also stopped. Infuriated, they severely beat both the bus driver and the ticket seller. The company, seeing that its employees had been beaten for no reason and that the bus's progress had been delayed, sent a letter to the North Station Branch requesting that the perpetrators be investigated. The letter is recorded as follows: Respectfully, our company's Transportation Section Chief Shi Guanfen reported that on the afternoon of the 21st of this month at 7:50 PM, driver Gao Sanhou, No. 72, was driving Public Bus No. 4936 along West Tiyuhui Road from south to north. Upon reaching the vicinity of the Kailin Paint Company, he turned the wheel slightly and immediately stopped to avoid pedestrians in front of the vehicle. At that time, a private car with city license No. 1430, a black license plate, (the owner of the car is reportedly an American, Mr. R.N. Harris) was approaching from the opposite direction and also stopped. Unexpectedly, three foreigners emerged from the vehicle. One of them climbed into the driver's seat through the eastern window, while the other two boarded the bus, and together they severely beat driver Gao Sanhou, No. 72, and ticket seller Pan Linyun, No. 58. As a result, the driver suffered a severe head injury, and the ticket seller also sustained head injuries. After finishing the beating, the three foreigners immediately returned to their private car and drove away. However, there were no police officers present at the time, and there was no way to call for help. They endured the pain and recorded the license plate number of the private car. They reported the incident to the Qujiaqiao Police Station. Upon hearing the news, the company reported it to your bureau and sent the two injured employees to Renji Hospital in the Concession for treatment. According to Gao Sanhou's medical certificate No. 5538, he needs to stop working for five days and visit the hospital for eight days before he can fully recover. The ticket seller's medical certificate No. 5537 states that he needs to be treated for one day. According to the report, the company's driver and ticket seller were severely beaten by the three foreigners for no reason. This is a violation of justice and an infringement on people's livelihood. We are sending this letter along with the two medical certificates, requesting your bureau to forward it to the superiors to investigate the perpetrators associated with city license No. 1430 and to give the three foreigners a warning and compensate the driver and ticket seller for all the losses they suffered from the injuries in order to maintain the safety of the people and protect commerce. We would be deeply grateful.</p>

<p>The Longcheng Silk Factory at No. 74, Lane 43, No. 1111, East Youheng Road, Aerkaok Road, suddenly caught fire at about 2:30 a.m. yesterday morning. Because it was in the middle of the night, it quickly became a raging fire, spreading to the neighboring buildings at Nos. 76, 78, 80, and 82. The residents were awakened from their dreams and fled in panic, causing great chaos. Fortunately, the fire brigade, alerted by a patrolman's telegraph, rushed to the scene with fire trucks and extinguished the fire, preventing it from spreading further. At the same time, the relevant police station also sent detectives to maintain order.

As a result, the Longcheng Silk Factory was completely destroyed by the fire, and the neighboring buildings also suffered losses. There are various rumors about the cause of the fire, so the police are still investigating.</p>

<p>Zhang Laosan, a woman from Changzhou, owns a brothel at No. 230 Guangxi Road and keeps two prostitutes, Xu Cainu and Wang Fengying. Recently, she lured Zhang Jinhua, a 15-year-old girl from her hometown, to Shanghai, intending to force her into prostitution. Because Zhang Jinhua was still a virgin, Zhang Laosan took her to room 5010 of the Nanfang Hotel on Jiangxi Road on the 2nd of this month. The hotel's tea attendant, Lu Jinlin from Taicang, was paid two yuan by Zhang Laosan for Zhang Jinhua to have her 'cherry broken'. Because the girl struggled, she was accidentally injured in the urethra by Lu, causing continuous bleeding and unconsciousness. Zhang Laosan sent her to Renji Hospital for treatment. This was learned by Zhang Jinhua's mother, Zhang Li, who went to the hospital and made a scene. The Laoza Police Station was notified by the hospital, and detectives Zhang Yuanjing and Jiang Linxiang arrested Zhang Laosan and Lu Jinlin, along with the two prostitutes Xu Cainu and Wang Fengying. They were sent to the Special First Court for trial. Lawyer Ru Baoqi, relying on Articles 240, 246, 247, and 315 of the Criminal Law, filed charges against Zhang Laosan and Lu.

<p>Yang Wei, a native of Nanjing at No. 485 Shanxi Road, is currently 20 years old. His father runs a store, and Yang assists in the store. In the autumn of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, he was introduced by a matchmaker and engaged to Jinling, a woman with the surname Zai from Suzhou. Jinling is twenty years old and beautiful. In October of that year, Yang held a formal wedding at the Yuandong Hotel on Xizang Road. Initially, the relationship between the two sides was harmonious. However, since the 16th day of the ancient lunar new year this year, Jinling suddenly took her clothes and ornaments and returned to her mother's home in Suzhou, claiming that she was going to celebrate the new year. Then, she suddenly went to her aunt's house at No. 2 Hekang Lane, Xintangjia Lane, and has been living there for four months without returning. Yang has asked his aunt to pick her up three times, but she has been refused. Yang has now hired lawyer Xu Jie to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Local Court, requesting that the defendant Jinling be ordered to cohabitate with him. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Qiao Wanxuan opened the seventh civil court for trial. Both the plaintiff and the defendant, along with their lawyers, appeared in court. According to the plaintiff Yang Wei, he requested cohabitation and had tried mediation, but it was unsuccessful, but there had been no maltreatment. The defendant's lawyer, Hu Fenglian, stated that the defendant was an old-fashioned woman who did not want a divorce, but if she were to cohabitate, the plaintiff should pay her a monthly allowance of 70 yuan in foreign currency. Judge Qiao advised both parties to reconcile, and the court adjourned the case to a later date for further investigation.</p>

<p>Wang Xiaodi, a native of Ningbo, was attacked with an ax and seriously injured outside the Yijia Gate at No. 59 Bouton Road on March 15 at 9:15 AM. Xie Jingen, also a native of Ningbo, was arrested and sent to the First Special District Court for trial and sentenced to eight months of imprisonment. He confessed that his accomplice, Shen Jinfal (also a native of Ningbo), was at large. An arrest warrant was issued. On the 12th of this month, Chinese detective Hu Guangrong of the Hongkou Police Station arrested Shen on Parker Road and sent him to the Third Criminal Court for detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi came to court for interrogation. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated that it was found that they had a feud over the sale of morphine and suspected that the victim Shen Xiaodi had informed the police, hence the attack. The defendant was being questioned on this basis. According to his confession, he went with the defendant to question Wang Xiaodi, which led to an argument. However, the defendant did use the ax handle to hit him. Questioned about this, the defendant's confession was evasive. Judge Jiang sentenced Shen Jinfal to eight months of imprisonment as a warning.</p>

<p>Tao Shirong, a native of Yangzhou, has been unemployed and unable to make a living recently, and has been secretly selling counterfeit money in a tea house at No. 567 Xizang Road for profit. On the 15th of this month, this was discovered by Chinese detective Ni Jiagui of the Hongkou Police Station. That night at about 9:00 PM, he sent an informant to act as a customer, agreeing that each counterfeit 100 yuan bill would be sold for 25 yuan in genuine foreign currency. Detective Ni paid 50 yuan, ordering 200 of the one yuan bills, promising to deliver the remainder the next morning after acquiring them from a ringleader named Lao Peng on Wuding Road. When the arrest was made, another counterfeit one yuan bill was found in his brass basin straw hat, and he was sent to the First Special District Court for trial. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi continued the trial in the Third Criminal Court. Lawyer Yu Yaotang of the Public Works Department stated that the leader Lao Peng could not be apprehended during the adjournment. Recently, such cases have occurred frequently in both the Chinese and Concession areas. The harm to society caused by these people is countless, and heavy punishment is necessary to prevent others from imitating them. Questioned by the defendant, he confessed that Xu Hong and two other fugitives had framed him and that he had nothing to do with it. Judge Jiang said that the evidence was solid and that there was no room for evasion, and sentenced Tao Shirong to two years and six months of imprisonment in court. The number of days spent in detention before the judgment was confirmed would be used to offset the imprisonment at a rate of two days for one day. The 101 counterfeit bills were confiscated and destroyed.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Berlin World Games: New Hurdle Structure Announced; Game Tickets on Sale from July 1; Venue to be Completed in Full by May Next Year <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin Dispatch) The 11th World Games, Berlin is actively preparing, sparing no effort. Regarding the new rules for hurdles, the General Assembly has officially announced its adoption. The German Ministry of the Army has also issued a welcome letter, welcoming athletes from all countries. The latest news is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>New Hurdle Structure</p>
<p>At this year's Stockholm International Amateur Athletics Federation meeting, regarding the hurdle issue, anyone who knocks down one or several hurdles will not have their results or qualifications canceled. However, in the past, when hurdles were knocked down, they often tripped runners' legs or fell onto the running tracks of others. The new hurdle rules will be used at next year's World Games. Therefore, the structure of the hurdles must be greatly changed. The new hurdle, as shown in the figure, is constructed of wood or steel bars. At both ends of a base, two columns stand upright. The ends of the columns are fitted with one or two horizontal bars that can be raised or lowered at will to meet the required height. During raising and lowering, a spiral can be used to make it stand firmly without falling. The total weight of the hurdle must be over 22 pounds. The horizontal bar must have a resistance of at least eight pounds to be knocked down. The height of the 110-meter high hurdle is 1.06 meters (formerly 1.067 meters). The height of the 200-meter low hurdle is 76.2 centimeters, and the 400-meter medium hurdle is 91.4 centimeters. The hurdle is 1.20 meters wide, and the base is 70 centimeters long. The upper horizontal bar is painted black and white.</p>
<p>Venue Completion Deadline</p>
<p>Due to the very good weather in May, work at the venue is being stepped up, with 2,300 workers. It is scheduled to be completed before May 1 next year. The large swimming pool and open-air theater can be completed by next autumn. The first completed field will be the hockey field.</p>
<p>Tickets on Sale</p>
<p>Tickets for various competitions will go on sale starting June 1. These tickets include track and field, swimming, boxing, equestrian, football, fencing, wrestling, weightlifting, hockey, handball, and gymnastics. Prices range from six to forty marks, with a total of 25 different types of tickets. Tickets for the opening ceremony on August 1 and the demonstration of baseball between the United States and Japan, and the closing ceremony on August 16, will be sold separately. Therefore, there are a total of 40 types. Various German travel agencies, the German-American Hamburg Shipping Company, and the North German Shipping Company will all be selling them starting July 1.</p>

<h3 id="e190">Finance: Guangdong Merchants Covering Short Positions, Gold Prices Soaring – Breaking Through the 800 Yuan Mark – Rising Twelve Yuan and Ninety Cents in Half a Day, Stakes Increase to Sixteen Thousand <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>The gold market has been steadily firm in recent days, and people's hearts are extremely excited. Yesterday, rumors of various bullish factors suddenly spread within the market, triggering a large number of buy orders. The short side was forced to close out positions in pain. Large traders widely bought to cover short positions, and the rise was so rapid that it broke through the 800 yuan mark. The morning began with the overseas silver market, where the British and Americans were flat. Large traders said that the United States and speculators had bought above the closing price of 0.625 after the market closed. The forward silver market in Monterrey was one to two cents higher. Exchange rates were slightly higher. London spot gold rose by one penny. The over-the-counter trading opened and immediately retreated to 86.7 yuan, and soon dropped to 5.5 yuan. Buyers took advantage of the low prices to become active and stabilized. The central bank's posted prices were announced, with both the British and Americans shrinking. The customs gold unit rose by one point and one tenth of a cent. The standard price for gold was posted at 843.2 yuan, and people's hearts were settled. After the opening, the market gradually recovered. Later, Guangdong merchants began to cover short positions, and rumors of inflating currency spread, fueling the rise. However, because HSBC's posted prices for both the British and Americans were flat, the long side cashed out. Although the rise occurred midway, there were many trades. The short side was already in a desperate situation, and retail investors had to scramble to buy bars, breaking through the 800 yuan mark and rising to 805 yuan. A major bank dumped shillings, and sellers took advantage of the high prices to become active, and the market retreated. Although Guangdong merchants strongly advanced, HSBC and China Merchants Bank repeatedly sold foreign exchange, the foreign exchange market loosened, and arbitrage activity increased. The government bond market did not rise, people's hearts calmed slightly, and selling pressure increased, retreating to within the 100 yuan mark, and the fall was close to the previous yuan. Guangdong merchants continued to advance, and foreign exchange also continued to stabilize due to the strong buying of China Merchants and Guangdong merchants. The supply side was no match. Afterwards, the market repeatedly broke through the 800 yuan mark. However, the banks' selling pressure was strong, and there were many trades after the rise, fluctuating around 800 yuan. Later, Reuters and Associated Press reported that Senator Thomas of the American Banking Association stated that 46 people in the Senate had jointly requested the government to increase the silver purchase policy. Although slightly weak, the short side's buying was still strong, and the market ultimately remained above the 800 yuan mark. The market situation in the first half of the day was extremely strong. If the banks had not taken the opportunity to suppress prices, the rise would not have been limited to this level. The market situation in the first half of the day is recorded below:</p>

After the opening, the market loosened slightly, but because the Central Bank's posted rate was revealed, sterling narrowed by 0.25 and the dollar fell by 0.25. Customs gold rose by 1 fen and 1 li, stabilizing the sentiment of Chinese merchants. Rumors of positive news resurfaced, and Chinese merchants suddenly rushed to cover their short positions. Due to a lack of supply, although the HSBC's posted rate was flat, the process was extremely tight again and again. Later, the Central Bank took advantage of the high prices to release shillings, slightly stabilizing the situation. HSBC, the Central Bank, and others worked diligently to release US dollars and shillings, gradually easing the market. However, with the vigorous buying of Cantonese banks and Chinese merchants, the market was maintained. Thereafter, the market fluctuated between tightness and looseness, remaining unstable. The gold market remained firm, leading to hedging activities by Chinese merchants. Despite the large-scale selling by banks, the market was able to hold up. The situation was tight for forward months and slightly closer for swap rates. Finally, Reuters and the Associated Press reported that US banks had sent 46 senators to jointly petition the government to raise the silver price, slightly loosening the trend.

<p>Yesterday at the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce Securities Exchange, with only the last two days remaining for trading this month, both bulls and bears were heavily involved in rollovers, and the market should have stabilized temporarily. Unexpectedly, groundless rumors suddenly emerged in the market, causing considerable shock at this approaching settlement. Bullish parties dumped their holdings, while retail investors made some new sales, resulting in a sudden drop of over one yuan. Later, due to strong buying by large investors and support from arbitrage trading, the market gradually stabilized, and shares in demand flourished at the close. For the future trend, with only the last day remaining for trading this month, some squeezing is inevitable, but both bulls and bears are generally prepared, and there should be no drastic changes. At the opening yesterday morning, rumors suddenly spread in the market that the 14th issue would be abandoned, causing the price to plummet by half a yuan. After that, due to the absorption by issues 4, 47, the market turned slightly calmer. However, later, due to the rush selling by sellers, the downward trend resumed. Issues 70, 53, and 48 all experienced selling, with the gold shorts suddenly dropping by over one yuan, and the rest uniformly dropping by several jiao. In the second session, leading issues were sluggish by about five fen to four jiao, while the rear issues, particularly 4, 47, turned upward due to strong demand. At the opening of the afternoon session, arbitrage trading became increasingly active, with issues 35, 43, and 46 continuing to be absorbed, and the market price continued to rise by five fen to three jiao. At the close, due to good news in the evening paper, issues 74 and 4 continued to be bought, while issues 11, 53, and 78 also experienced considerable selling. As a result, the market recovered by a few jiao. Overall, the final market price for the day was uniformly down by two or three jiao to five or six jiao, with a total transaction amount of 24,760,000 yuan. The high, low, and final results are listed and compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>According to a report from Sun Fung Yang Hang, yesterday (the 21st), the New York stock market rallied, completely recovering the losses of the previous two days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a new high since 1931. The fear caused by Roosevelt's wealth distribution plan has been eliminated.

<p>The soaring situation in the yarn market is unusually strong, due to the emergence of rumors in the market that a certain old matter would be brought up again, and that yarn factories would resume reducing production, causing excitement. Short sellers covered their positions, and bulls added to their positions, with both sides advancing in tandem. As a result, the upward momentum became stronger and stronger. In fact, the market has been falling for a long time, and once it rebounds, it is difficult to stop.</p>
<p>Futures Yarn Soars by Two and a Half Yuan</p>
<p>At the opening of the front market for standard yarn, the situation this month was extremely chaotic. Rumors were rampant in the market, saying that the standard gold had broken through the 800 yuan level. Tat Kee was bidding to buy in this month, calling out 170 yuan. After the bulls spat out some, the market recovered slightly. The opening jump was 2.8 yuan, and the far months followed with a rise of 0.9 jiao. In the second and third sessions, foreign merchants sold short again, and the market quickly reversed. As a result, the near month rose by 1.2 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day, and the far month rose by 7.8 jiao. At the opening of the afternoon session, the current month was still flat, down by 0.5 jiao. When the market was snapped up to the far month, it suddenly became tight. Discussions were rampant in the market, and all the news was positive. The market price rose step by step, and the market sentiment was extremely sharp. As a result, all months rose by 1.2 yuan to 1.78 yuan compared to the morning closing price.

<p>The cotton market is trending firm, and the price increase is sharp. Due to consecutive days of decline, today's rumors are positive. Sellers are covering their positions, and bulls are buying more. At the same time, rumors about the currency issue are also prevalent, and the market is soaring. However, foreign merchants are still selling, and it is difficult to predict the future.</p>
<p>Standard Cotton Jumps by Five or Six Jiao</p>
<p>At the opening of the front market for standard cotton, all months showed an upward trend. The atmosphere was chaotic in the market. Because the standard gold soared, many rumors were beneficial to the bulls. However, some were selling high, and the market fell back slightly in the second and third sessions. As a result, the near month rose by 1.5 jiao, and the far month fell by 0.5 fen. At the opening of the afternoon session, the yarn market rose sharply, and the buying frenzy in the market was high. There were many saying that the future standard gold was looking up. As a result, buyers came like a tide. All months rose by 4.5 to 6 jiao compared to the morning closing price.

<p>Spot Cotton Sales Remain Quiet</p>
<p>The spot cotton market is becoming more and more silent. Factory demand is completely absent, and the futures market has risen sharply, making spot cotton even more difficult to sell. It is estimated that Yao Hua has 1,185 bales, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened. Due to rain in Arkansas and Oklahoma, with forecasts of continued showers, Liverpool banks bought, and all months rose by one to two points. Then, due to sales in New Orleans, the July contract was exhausted and weakened. Brokers and short sellers absorbed the cotton. Poor textile conditions, lower government loan predictions for new cotton, and factory sales all caused anxiety. Hester estimated that factory use this week would be 277,000 bales, and Liverpool's inventory was 231,000 bales. The closing was flat and weak, with spot prices falling by five points and futures prices falling by five to eight points. Spot English cotton rose by one point, and futures prices rose by seven points. The Indian cotton market was calm, with little speculative demand. Pink Gold rose by 1.5 rupees, Oomra rose by 1 rupee, and White Rowse rose by 1.25 rupees. The original electric recording is on the left (21st electricity):</p>

<p>A telegram from New York on the 21st reported on the cotton market for the week: The cotton market was uneven this week. The price sometimes fell because bulls liquidated their positions, the weather was good, the new cotton crop was starting well, cotton goods were stagnant, and there was a possibility of further reductions in factory work in mid-July. However, purchases by brokers and short covering provided support. The export incentive money for agriculture adjustment bill proposed by the House and the difference between the market price here and abroad caused the investor to be uncertain leading to liquidation of the bullish investor or cross-selling with Liverpool. Although this bill must be approved by the Senate, some people doubt whether export subsidies can be used even if the bill is finally adopted. There was no mention of new cotton loan, which depends on the development of new cotton. The clear weather throughout the week relieved some of the worries about the west, but warm weather is still needed. Weekly statistics are as follows (unit: 1,000 bales):</p>

<p>Yesterday in the flour market, the atmosphere had stabilized in the morning, because imported wheat from Chicago was good by about 1-2 jiao, and Canadian wheat was good by 0.25. Although actual sales were small, factory production also decreased accordingly. The selling of all futures contracts was on hold due to fear of future risks. Demand therefore turned solid leading to market stabilisation. At the opening in the afternoon, both near-term and forward contracts became more expensive. There were rumors about changes in the cargo structure, so some short sellers were eager to cover their positions, and the bulls also took advantage of the situation, with considerable absorption. Due to credit conditions this month, the degree of increase was still slight, and the forward contracts were particularly enthusiastic. Observing the future, both drought and flooding are a concern, and the ups and downs of the market may depend on this. As a result, the current month rose by 1 fen, July rose by 1 fen and 2.5 li, August rose by 1 fen and 1.5 li, September rose by 2 fen, October rose by 1 fen and 1.5 li, and November rose by 2 fen and 7 li.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market was stable, because quotations for imported wheat were slightly better, and the Saskatchewan Grain Board and the treaty ports were not as enthusiastic as in previous years due to credit conditions. At the opening in the afternoon, the market atmosphere improved, because the flour market rose sharply, and rumors were favorable to rising prices. Short sellers were uneasy and covered their positions smoothly. New wheat this year, except in the Jiangnan area, was still inexpensive. Wheat from Jinpu above Bengbu, due to the relatively high value, was mostly transported north. The market had a bullish outlook. The result was that July rose by 3 fen, August rose by 4 fen, and September and October each rose by 5 fen. The spot wheat market remained unstable, and arrivals were unseen. The industry estimates that they will arrive in about a month. Kai Ming Guang Guan Dian held wheat at 3.48 yuan, second grade at 40. The price of Wu Yi wheat was 3.5 yuan, Tang Shi wheat was 3.45 yuan, Hu Shu wheat was 3.345 yuan, Peng Lai wheat was 3.323 yuan, Jiang Xin Zhou wheat was 3.367 yuan, Nanjing and Zhou Zhi Tang wheat was 3.31 yuan, and Kun Shan wheat was 3.5 yuan. Jiu Qian San Bai Bao from You Feng Xin Shen Da Feng Xin Da He.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat: Continued rain in the west delayed harvesting, so short sales were also extended. If prices fell low, the government might step in to maintain them, but there were very few buyers, so prices might still be difficult to avoid falling.</p>

<h3 id="e199">Rainy Season and Farm Work Result in Quiet Rice Market <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, only about ten sources arrived in the Hu Nan area, (goods totaling nearly 3,000 shi. Because merchants were absent due to the rain, sales came to a halt. Although there were a few purchases, prices fell by a jiao. The rice market in Hu Bei was also experiencing continuous rain, with few river shipments and only a few sellers listing. Although the rain stopped at noon, there was some activity, and the price of white rice fell by another jiao, with thin rice and white rice prices dropping, and most other goods falling slightly.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the imported rice market was slack, and people were at ease. The farm busy season is approaching, and procurement from various routes has been slow. There is a trend toward gradually shrinking. In the morning, the price of various imported rice fell by five or six fen, and after the price decline, the Changjiang gang had some good appetite. The general market was stabilized, but it is still difficult to predict the future market.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Oil Cake and Soybeans Rise Simultaneously <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the oil cake market was smooth. It could rise again, barring unexpected issues. The amount of peanut oil was 200 pieces and the prices are up 0.5 yuan. Soybean oil was more than 850 pieces and the prices continued to rise 0.2. One thousand pieces of cake and prices rise. The price of soybeans has been rising. It is calculated that the factory has taken the whole river beans. The Sipingjie bean was used by Yongjie. Seven to eight cart from Fanjiatun beans. In Western Chengzhen, a few carts of each.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the refined sugar market was trending upward due to the increase in customs duty. However, sales remained thin, and there was no power to rise. The Public Association called out 16 yuan for a lot of one rough raw sugar and white freight to rise by seven fen, and it called for five yuan for the re-exported goods, but no transactions were made. The price of Taikoo Sugar B Mark fell to 17.1 yuan, and then the price of 0.3 was not made. Yesterday, it traded at 17.2 yuan, up 0.1 yuan. The price of Mian Bai, which has been increased by the Ben Chang's Yuying, is 15.3 yuan, and the amount of 234 remains unchanged. There were only bids for the lot of goods, and none were opened. On the previous day, a shipment of 140 bags of Quanzhou Chishi were imported by the Huaping Wheel.</p>

<p>The sea noodles produced in Xiamen have recently been mostly transported to the two ports due to sluggish sales in Shanghai. If Shanghai has needs, it will also purchase from Tianzhu. Therefore, it is difficult to cut off arrivals here. Yesterday, I heard that Tianfang had transported more than 30 pieces of noodles, which are still dry and green, which is considerable. The quoted price is 13 yuan per piece, but it has not yet been made a sale.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the green tea market continued to be active. European merchants, in view of this year's low prices and reduced supply, and because the exchange rate has been favorable recently, were eager to buy. Transactions of rough-grade, stripped, common Zhenmei were strong. Medium- and high-grade goods rose back by five or six yuan. The market turned firmer. The rough-grade Pingshui and the two types of Pearl Tea were also very active in the market yesterday. The stock of Shexian Zhuang goods on the market, not less than 1,400 boxes, was almost completely swept away by Jinlong Foreign Company. Other Pingshui Earth Zhuang and other kinds of goods are also under negotiation by XIEHE Huacha. However, the black tea market was slightly quiet compared to before.</p>

<p>Recently, the demand for narrow strip tinplate of one inch or more from local manufacturers in this area has been low, resulting in a quiet market. Consequently, businesses have had to focus on traders from other regions. Xi'an, as a major commercial hub of the future, requires a large quantity of prime tinplate and narrow strip tinplate. Over the past few days, shipments of three to four hundred boxes have been sent. Narrow strip tinplate is particularly popular in that city, accounting for about seventy to eighty percent of the purchases. The price is around twenty yuan for narrow strips and twenty-eight yuan for prime tinplate. Additionally, traders from Hankou, Sichuan, and Changsha are also placing substantial orders for narrow strip goods. Although prices haven't increased, the quality and sturdiness are far superior to what they used to be.</p>

<h3 id="e205">Ambition <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Yi Cottage Owner</p>
<p>Everyone has aspirations; that is, each person has their own "ambition." A's "ambition" cannot be forced upon B, nor can B's "ambition" be forced upon A. For example, A's "ambition" might be in farming, while B's "ambition" is in craftsmanship. If you were to force A, who is inclined to farming, to do craftwork, it would certainly not work. Similarly, forcing B, who is inclined to craftwork, to farm would also be impossible.</p>
<p>Because, one should always pursue endeavors that align with their "ambition" to feel interested. Only by feeling interested can one achieve something. Otherwise, without "ambition," doing things randomly is like a ship without a compass sailing in the ocean! Boundless and without direction, aimlessly drifting about, how easy would it be to reach the destination?</p>
<p>From this perspective, "It is important for a person to have ambition" is indeed not "empty talk." So, dear little friends, where lies your future "ambition"? In farming? In craftsmanship? Or in commerce? Know that the world is vast, and there are more than just these three industries of agriculture, craftsmanship, and commerce. There are many other careers! It all depends on setting your "ambition" and pursuing it!</p>
<h3 id="e206">The Childhood of Kettering <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Peng</p>
<p>When you hear the rumbling sound of an engine in the sky, you look up and see an airplane like a dragonfly speeding through the air. I think everyone knows that airplanes were invented in 1905 by the American brothers Orville and Wilbur Wright. But who invented the engine in the airplane? It was Kettering. Perhaps few of the children know about him! Now, let me introduce some of his early history below:</p>
<p>Charles Kettering was born in a small village in New York on May 21, 1876. The village was surrounded by hills, and it was inconvenient to get in and out because one had to go around. When he was young and saw this situation, he thought how convenient and effort-saving it would be to have a bicycle to ride back and forth! So he saved up his money and bought a bicycle. Later, he was not satisfied and wanted to install an engine on the bicycle, which would be ten thousand times faster. Therefore, he looked for books on the principles and structure of engines, studied them carefully, and succeeded after several failures, making it many times faster than ordinary bicycles. But he still worked hard to improve it.</p>
<p>Kettering's good fortune came. - In 1907, the All-American Bicycle Competition was held in Florida, and he went to participate, winning first place, and from then on, the whole of America knew about him. Soon, even greater good fortune came. At this time, Bell, the inventor of the telephone, was the president of the American Aviation Association. He knew that Kettering's engine was incomparably excellent, so he personally visited Kettering and asked him to join the Aviation Association and to make his invention of the engine into a refined airplane. This opportunity enabled the American aviation industry to advance by leaps and bounds and have unlimited progress.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Candle Goldfish <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Zhi</p>
<p>Little friends, have you seen goldfish? Their round bodies, bright red scales, protruding eyes, and fluffy tails are so beautiful! If you like them, you can use candle wax to make goldfish that look exactly like the real thing to play with. Here is how to make goldfish:</p>
<p>Mix red and white candle wax to make a goldfish model with a red back and a light red belly. Stick some iron filings on the abdomen, in the right amount, not too much or too little, so that it can remain still in any position in the water. Cover the iron filings with another layer of candle wax so that they cannot be seen. This completes the active goldfish.</p>
<p>When playing, put the goldfish in a glass of water, and then take a magnet and slowly move it up, down, left, and right outside the glass. The goldfish will follow the magnet and sink and float in the glass. At first glance, it looks like a real goldfish.</p>
<p>Little friends, do you find it strange? Why can the goldfish's body stand upright? Why does the goldfish follow the magnet and float up and down? This principle is easy to understand, because the goldfish's abdomen is attached with iron filings, its center of gravity is on the abdomen, and the body can stand upright; and the magnet has the ability to attract iron filings, so when the magnet moves outside the glass, the goldfish swims in the glass.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Little Sapling <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>

Grows longer, grows taller, blooms beautiful flowers, bears sweet peaches; look! The whole garden is full of vitality, all thanks to this little sapling. Little friends! You are little saplings, studying hard every day, exercising all the time; the strength of your motherland depends on you little saplings.</p>

<p>——Performance——</p>
<p>These four story pictures are very interesting. (1) Several children are watching the performance, and their faces all look very happy. (2) The performance suddenly fails. (3) Several watching children are alarmed. (4) The children have already seen the inside story of the performance clearly.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Flying Fish and Swimming Birds <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Gong Chao</p>
<p>In the ocean, there is a kind of flying fish that can jump out of the sea and fly as far as five hundred feet. Originally, its pectoral fins are particularly long, as long as the wings of a bird. When it jumps out of the water, it spreads its two pectoral fins and flies as fast as a ship.</p>
<p>It is very unfortunate: In the sea, there are gluttonous sharks and dolphins that want to eat it. When it is chased by them, it escapes into the air, but the albatrosses and other birds in the air are opening their greedy mouths. As soon as they see it escape from the water, they desperately chase it. Therefore, it is often escaping for its life in the double attack of two enemies.</p>
<p>This flying fish is a silvery, large-eyed thing.</p>
<p>Just the opposite, in the birds, there are things that cannot fly but can swim, one of which is the penguin. Penguins are produced in the Southern Ocean. Its wings have become fin-shaped, so it can swim in the water. When swimming, it uses these fin-shaped wings to paddle, going up and down in the water. At first glance, it really doesn't know whether it is a fish or a bird. Its head and back are black, its belly is white, and its feet are short.</p>
<p>It often stands upright, as if looking forward to something, so it is called a penguin.</p>
<p>After reading the above two examples, we can understand that animals, in order to adapt to the environment, can slowly transform a part of their body into a more useful shape in order to adapt to survival.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Pencil <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>"Brother, is the black carbon strip in the pencil made of lead?" Xiang'er showed some suspicion, while holding a pencil in his hand.</p>
<p>"You're wrong. We call it a pencil, but it's not actually made of lead. It's made of graphite," Ji'er replied with a smile.</p>
<p>"Since it's made of graphite, why don't we call it a graphite pencil and insist on calling it a pencil?"</p>
<p>"Generally, people think that graphite is very similar to lead, so they call it a pencil, and pencil is easier to call than graphite pencil."</p>
<p>"Brother, how is a pencil made? Can you tell me?"</p>
<p>"Pencil manufacturing (1) Grind graphite into powder, then mix it with clay and water. (2) Press this graphite mixture into a dough, and then pass it through a long tube in a squeezer to make a thin, elongated strip. There are no wooden pieces at that time. (3) The wooden strips for pencils are mostly cypress, because this kind of tree has straight grain, soft texture, and is easy to cut. First cut it into wooden sections, and then use a machine to cut it into small square wooden strips of uniform length. (4) After the wooden strips are cut, a groove is carved on them at the same time. First apply a layer of glue to the graphite, and then embed it one by one into this groove to make it stick firmly. Then put another piece of wood on top to make a square pencil. (5) Put it on a rounding machine to make a long round pencil. (6) Apply paint and rub it to make the appearance beautiful. After dyeing, wait for it to dry, and then put it in the machine to make it the appropriate length. Then engrave the text on the pencil. Brother, look! A pencil must go through such complicated procedures. You must be more economical when you use a pencil next time!"</p>

<p>— Yi De</p>
<p>The younger brother said to the elder sister: "These days, because of the sports meet, our school practices gymnastics every day. Our group gymnastics has been practiced several times, and the lineup is very neat and spectacular."</p>
<p>The elder sister said: "What's so strange about that? I can ask the numbers to line up! If you don't believe me, you call for a pencil and paper."</p>
<p>The younger brother ran away like flying, and ran back with a pencil and paper like flying, and said to the elder sister: "Please tell me quickly, how can the numbers be lined up?"</p>
<p>The elder sister said: "You use thirty-seven to multiply by three, use thirty-seven to multiply by six, to multiply by nine, and the numbers will line up."</p>
<p>The younger brother followed the elder sister's words and multiplied like this</p>
<p>After the younger brother multiplied, he took a look and couldn't help but be happy and said: "Elder sister! What you said is really good, the numbers multiplied out are really lined up in neat lines!"</p>
<p>The elder sister said: "Not only can the three numbers 1, 2, and 3 line up, but the other numbers 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 can also line up."</p>
<p>The younger brother hurriedly asked the elder sister to tell him, and the elder sister said: "Still use thirty-seven to multiply. You remember: use thirty-seven to multiply by twelve, fifteen, eighteen, twenty-one, twenty-four, twenty-seven. As long as you don't multiply wrong, they will all line up in neat lines."</p>
<p>The younger brother followed the numbers that the elder sister said and multiplied one by one, multiplied out like this:</p>
<p>After the younger brother multiplied and took a look, he couldn't help but clap his hands and said with great joy: "This kind of arithmetic game is really extremely ingenious!"</p>

<p>— (Tu Hongxia)</p>
<p>"Hands," everyone has two. There are a few things that these two should pay attention to:</p>
<p>(1) Nails should be trimmed often to avoid hiding dirt.</p>
<p>(2) Wash hands before eating to avoid germs following food into the stomach and causing illness.</p>
<p>(3) Wash hands after eating to avoid the greasy food staining hands and clothes.</p>
<p>(4) Fingers should not be put in the mouth.</p>
<p>(5) Do not scratch the skin arbitrarily, as it can cause skin diseases.</p>
<p>(6) Dirty things should not come into contact with hands.</p>
<p>(7) Wash hands often with medicated soap.</p>
<p>(8) If a knife punctures a finger, disinfect and stop the bleeding quickly.</p>
<p>Little friends! Above are eight points regarding hand care. I hope everyone will keep them in mind at all times.</p>

<p>— Chao Yi</p>
<p>The Chinese Children's Culture Association, which had been in preparation for a long time, held its founding conference on the sixteenth. The meeting place was on the third floor of the Continental Department Store on Nanjing Road. It was arranged very neatly and elegantly. Many people attended, including several children. I looked at everyone's smiling faces and the place where the association was born, and I felt unspeakable joy in my heart.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the meeting, Mr. Huang Jiping, a reporter from this newspaper, presided. He said that this association was established to build a beautiful cultural landscape for our country's children and to seek happiness for the children. He showed a kind of enthusiastic emotion when he spoke. Then, Mr. Lin Yin reported on the work of the preparatory period: holding literacy service groups with little teachers, broadcasting children's music, etc. At this time, I suddenly remembered the "New Children's Song" a few days ago, and the singing seemed to still be in my ears.</p>
<p>Originally, there were also speeches by Mr. Pan Gongzhan and Tao Zhixing, but they could not come because of something. Later, the charter was discussed. Many proposals were also passed: holding children's book and newspaper exhibitions regularly, organizing children's libraries, setting up children's book and newspaper cars, ... I hope everyone will implement them quickly.</p>
<p>In addition, I heard that there are news of various places asking to organize branches. In the future, I really want to ask my younger brother and younger sister to join the association nearby and do this great work together.</p>
<p>When the meeting adjourned, the lights all around were on. I went home in the light. Although I walked a long way, I didn't feel tired at all.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Remarks on "Fishing in the Sea" <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Fisherman of Wusong Fisheries School</p>
<p>On May 10th, I read an article titled "Fishing in the Sea" in the Spring and Autumn Children's Weekly. The author's dissemination of fisheries knowledge to children is certainly worthy of our admiration, but the objects depicted in the illustration accompanying that article are somewhat different from the real thing. From what I know, I will correct it a little bit, which may be welcome by the original author who advocates fisheries education?</p>
<p>In the original picture, we saw a fishing vessel towing a net forward, and another net stretched out in the sea. Both of these things have errors.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the error of the fishing vessel towing the net: There are two types of fishing vessels towing nets, namely: trawl fishing vessels and double-trawl fishing vessels. The former uses one vessel to tow one net, and the latter uses two vessels to tow one net (the structure of the vessels and nets is of course different). The original picture is a trawl fishing vessel, but there are some errors in the towing cable and the net: there are two towing cables, each with a length of one hundred and twenty fathoms, and a diameter of one inch, twisted from six strands of net silk rope. One end of the towing net is tied to the towing cable car on the deck (divided into left and right towing cable cars), and the other end is tied to the net board at the mouth of the net. When fishing begins, the net is locked to the east lock of the towing cable. From the angle formed by the two nets, the size of the opening of the turning net can be known, so if you want the opening of the net to be large, just enlarge the angle, and if you want the opening of the net to be small, just reduce the angle formed by the cable! The operating time of the vessel towing the net is about three hours each time, and usually only six or seven catches can be made in one day and night; each voyage out to sea for fishing takes about ten days.</p>
<p>Second, let's talk about the net stretched out in the sea. That kind of net is the so-called gill net, and the net for catching anchovies (those with eggs are called kaozi fish) is also one of them. In addition to the net body and floats, there are sinkers and float tubes on the net. Because of the floats and sinkers, the net body is floated upwards by the floats, and sunk downwards by the sinkers, so that the net is opened up and down. In addition, a float tube is tied to one end of the net, and most of the fishing vessels are sailing vessels.</p>
<p>The above is just a correction of the errors in the original picture. However, the little friends may not understand, so I think it would be best to ask your teachers to lead you to visit the fishing vessels, fishing boats, fisheries experiment fields, or fisheries schools, then the knowledge you see and hear in the book and on paper will be more accurate and more!</p>

<p>At the end of this sixth voyage, I returned home, and I resolved to spend the rest of my life in my hometown.</p>
<p>One day, I was hosting a banquet for some friends when a servant came to inform me that a merchant from the court wanted to speak to me. I got up and went out to see him.</p>
<p>"The king sent me to say that he must speak to you," he said.</p>
<p>Naturally, I had to leave my guests and go to court immediately. I was led into the king's chamber, I kissed the ground before him, and he spoke to me.</p>
<p>He said: "Ah! Sinbad, I have something for you to do. I want you to send a letter and a gift to the King of Serendib."</p>
<p>I said, "Your Majesty, I have sworn never to leave my home in Baghdad again. If you can find someone who is worthy of doing this for you, I will be happy; if you cannot find anyone, then I am here to obey your command."</p>

<h3 id="e217">A Review of the Chinese Women's Movement <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Qiong</p>
<p>Also Discussing Mr. Wang Jiaoying's "Letter to Editor Shi Yin of 'Women and Youth'"</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Xiaoying published a letter in the 68th issue of this journal, "Letter to Editor Shi Yin of 'Women and Youth,'" discussing the reasons for and significance of the Chinese women's movement. In the current "smog-filled" stage of the Chinese women's movement, a re-evaluation of this issue is indeed very necessary. In addition to admiring Mr. Wang's attention to the women's movement, I dare not hide my own views. I intend to follow Mr. Wang's lead, adhering to the instruction that "we women seem to have a responsibility to pay attention to this letter," and humbly offer my ignorant opinions for Mr. Wang's consideration:</p>
<p>(1) An Analysis of the Current Stage of the Chinese Women's Movement:</p>
<p>In the current stage of the Chinese women's movement, the most common prevailing arguments are roughly the following two:</p>
<p>(A) Abolish the women's movement. Here, there are three different opinions circulating. First, as Mr. Shi Yin says:</p>
<p>"Men and women cannot be independent and separate. Why should 'women's movement' become a separate term, as if it has its own independent cause? It is very obvious that we regard it as natural and not strange for women to have 'women's associations,' but if men also have 'men's associations,' wouldn't it be ridiculous? I think this is the fundamental mistake of the so-called 'women's movement,' to divide men and women into two classes to confront each other. As for the 'women's rights movement,' the word 'rights' leads people to struggle, so naturally it is even more unworthy" (Women and Youth, issue 141).</p>
<p>This opinion is not due to "misunderstandings" arising from the current "Chinese 'women's movement' being incomplete or nominal," but is clearly a distortion produced by Mr. Shi Yin's insufficient understanding of social issues, or even his deliberate obfuscation of social issues. Undeniably, in the current society, men and women have common ground in their status. At the same time, everyone will admit that although women have already obtained the empty principle of "equality between men and women," in reality, whether in politics, society, or economics, the inequality of status between men and women still exists. Here, of course, we cannot "divide men and women into two classes to confront each other," but as long as the specific fact of "inequality" exists, Mr. Shi Yin cannot dissolve the specific into the general and deny the necessity of the women's movement. As for whether the "women's movement" should adopt the "women's rights movement" approach, I will discuss it in the next section.</p>
<p>The second opinion believes that since the women's movement was loudly advocated from the May Fourth Movement until now, the result has only been to add "campus belles" to schools and "vases" to institutions, and believes that this result is entirely the product of the women's movement, and so it recklessly shouts for the abolition of the women's movement. If this attempt is not deliberately intended to make "women forever subordinate to men," it is simply a case of "throwing the baby out with the bathwater." I believe that the reason why the women's movement has achieved such results is not in the women's movement itself, but in the failure to adequately solve the entire social problem. This fact does not prove that the women's movement cannot exist, but only proves that the women's problem cannot be solved separately from the entire social problem. In this light, the reason why the women's liberation of the current stage has degenerated and become corrupt is entirely the result of seeking a way out under the current situation. Therefore, if the previous proposition uses the general to obliterate the specific, then this proposition wants to use the specific to obliterate the general itself: when the specific itself cannot solve the problem, even the specific itself is obliterated.</p>
<p>The third opinion is even more "straightforward and blunt," and does not, like the previous two, hide under some kind of mask to complete its attempt to "send women home"; instead, it openly brandishes the banner of "virtuous wife and good mother," ordering "women to go home," or using "pleasant" words like "the solution to the women's problem lies in obtaining family happiness. If one can understand moral responsibility, understand tolerance, patience, and calmness in the family, one will naturally obtain happiness," to anesthetize women, making them "willingly serve" as domestic slaves. People of this kind superficially hang up the sign of the women's movement, but their abolition of the women's movement and betrayal of women's interests is already obvious to all and needs no further criticism; the above three propositions, whether directly or indirectly abolishing the women's movement, are all using restorationist methods to anesthetize the progressive consciousness of young women, all attempting to sacrifice women to temporarily alleviate the current economic and political crisis.</p>
<p>(B) Acknowledging that the women's movement has a necessity to exist, while at the same time believing that the current stage of the Chinese women's movement is still stagnating in the "women's rights movement" stage. Mr. Wang is a staunch advocate of this view. In her letter to Mr. Shi Yin, she said, "You say that the 'women's rights movement' leads people to struggle with the word 'rights,' which is not right. This sounds right on the surface; but now that men are depriving women of their rights and freedoms, we should not embrace a non-resistance doctrine and make women succumb to the iron hooves of men and allow them to be slaughtered." From these few words, it is clear that Mr. Wang is embracing "Nora's courage," from the May Fourth Movement to the present, sticking to a consistent position, and stubbornly wanting to thoroughly complete the principle of "equality" between men and women. Her spirit of struggle is certainly admirable; however, she has isolated the women's movement from the entire social problem, failing to see the historical background of the women's rights movement; as a result, the due development of the Chinese women's movement has also been neglected, and the result is that she will forever embrace the women's rights movement of the "May Fourth era," growing old together, and unknowingly becoming a sacrifice of the times.</p>
<p>(2) The Social Background of the Women's Movement</p>
<p>Based on the above analysis, there is no need to elaborate on the various opinions on abolishing the women's movement. However, it is necessary to conduct a detailed review of the women's rights movement to determine its significance. In order to understand this issue more clearly, I intend to describe it in three points: 1. The occurrence of the women's movement, 2. The temporality of the women's rights movement, 3. The women's problem in capitalist society.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Wang's opinion, the occurrence of the women's movement, which is also the reason for its existence, is because "men... have become a special class" to women, and the purpose of the women's movement is "to awaken women's own consciousness and resist all the oppression given by men, to eliminate the class between the sexes and create a world of absolute equality between men and women." This abstract concept, just as Mr. Wang said, "seems to be very right on the surface," but once you look at the reality, it feels as if it is right and wrong. The emergence of all social problems has a certain economic structure as its basis; at the same time, the solution to all social problems must also be at a certain stage of economic development, that is, within the limits allowed by economic development, before it is possible. In history, since the collapse of the golden age of equality between men and women – the primitive communal society – women were not allowed to participate in social productive labor and were restricted within the family. Men, relying on their private property rights, forced women to be subordinate to their authority. Therefore, women cannot be equal to men in politics, economics, and society. This situation reached its peak in the feudal era. If we follow Mr. Wang's argument, at this time, women must rise up to "resist all the oppression given by men." But this is not the case; at that time, there was clearly no women's movement. What existed was only deceptive etiquette such as "three obediences and four virtues." No one can deny that the women's movement is a special product of capitalist development. Why did the women's movement only emerge at this time? Perhaps some people believe it is because at this time, there were "pioneers" who rose up to "awaken women's own consciousness." Even if this is correct, we still have to ask why these "pioneers" were not born in slave society and feudal society, but only in capitalist society? Or why would they be treated as rebels and severely punished in slave society and feudal society, but praised in capitalist society, and even be able to join the ranks of men and "hold official positions," etc.?</p>
<p>Originally, after the Industrial Revolution, with the large-scale development of capitalism, the need for free laborers became more and more urgent. First, the shackles of the majority of men selling their labor were eliminated through "serf emancipation." Furthermore, as capitalism continued to develop, the prisoners who had been imprisoned in their homes for thousands of years – women – had to be expelled from their families and dragged into factories in large numbers. The progress of the division of labor and the adoption of machines gradually made it possible for women's labor to be widely adopted; at the same time, the low wages of female workers catered to the greed of factory owners even more. However, the heavy shackles of feudal morality hindered the progress of the "women leaving home" movement; the women's problem was thus a product of this contradiction, and the women's movement gained its conditions for existence to solve this contradiction.</p>
<p>For example, the women's movement during the French Revolution was because, from the 15th to the 18th centuries, the strict regulations of the guilds confined the field of women's occupations to a very narrow space, and the field of productive activity was completely occupied by men. Thus, working women demanded "equal rights with men in labor," which, in other words, was "absolute freedom of labor." They also knew very clearly that "to have freedom of labor, it is essential to abolish the feudal system and destroy the guild organizations." In order to achieve this goal, they also enthusiastically participated in the bourgeois democratic revolution of the time, under the banner of freedom and equality.</p>
<p>With the development of capitalism, the women's rights movement in various countries has successively achieved more or less success; the principle of equality between men and women has at least been recognized in theory. However, although the women's rights movement has achieved considerable success, the women's problem has clearly not been thoroughly solved. Because women have broken away from feudal bondage, they are also bound by capital. After their liberation, they still cannot become healthy women in the ideal sense, and are even forced to become "vases," "dance stars," etc. The political power that can be obtained in capitalist society is originally only established to protect the interests of special positions; therefore, the rights obtained by women in the women's rights movement naturally cannot exceed the general level. Moreover, due to various traditional relationships (mainly property rights, etc., which are generally still monopolized by men), women are generally more backward than men in politics, economics, and culture; their scope of work is far narrower than that of men, and the treatment they receive is also not as good as that of men. Therefore, in capitalist society, women on the one hand partially break away from the shackles of the family and participate in social production work, and are exploited by capitalists; on the other hand, they are also more or less affected by the remnants of feudalism and are still trapped under the control of men. The women's problem of the current stage has emerged from these two layers of shackles. Therefore, the solution to this problem is of course not something that the anti-feudal women's rights movement of the previous stage can accomplish. Only by linking it to the entire social relationship that gives rise to the women's problem can we obtain the key to thoroughly solving the women's problem of the current stage.</p>
<p>(3) China's Social Changes and the Women's Problem</p>
<p>Now that the historical development of the women's movement, especially the temporality of the women's rights movement, is clear, we will now observe the core of the Chinese women's problem at the current stage and its solution. In order to correctly understand this point, we must first analyze China's social changes before addressing the problem itself.</p>
<p>Since the Opium War, the sprouts of capitalism have begun to grow in China, and the women's liberation movement that closely followed has also gradually begun to emerge. During World War I, the economic aggression of the great powers temporarily eased, and China's national industry developed rapidly. At this time, the demands of the emerging bourgeoisie to resist feudal forces and even lift the economic shackles of the great powers became increasingly strong; at the same time, the idea of equality between men and women also permeated the country. The vigorous May Fourth Movement was the product of this social change. Following the considerable success of the May Fourth Movement, especially the subsequent May 30th Incident and the National Revolution of 1926-27, the restrictions on women in education, occupation, and marriage were gradually opened, and women's participation in politics and inheritance rights were also recognized by law. The Chinese women's rights movement came to an end at this point.</p>
<p>Naturally, the Chinese women's rights movement not only cannot exceed the general achievements of various countries, but is even below the general level. Because China is a semi-colonial country: the economic aggression of the great powers makes the development of China's national capital particularly difficult, so its anti-feudal task cannot be thoroughly completed. Correspondingly, the feudal shackles suffered by Chinese women are actually far greater than those of Britain, the United States, and other countries. On the other hand, under the control of this foreign capital, it is extremely difficult for Chinese national capital to develop. Therefore, they have to use more backward and more harmful methods to deal with working women. Mr. Wang said, "Now the center of Chinese politics is men, the center of society is men," and what about the center of the family? At the same time, she pointed out various facts of inequality in politics, economics, and society. These are certainly correct; however, we can no longer simply attribute these phenomena to the fact that the women's rights movement has not been successful, and it certainly cannot be solved by the women's rights movement. The "vases and dance stars" that I mentioned before, especially the various inhuman lives endured by factory women and rural women in this bleak and dilapidated countryside, cannot be solved by the right to participate in politics, "the right to inherit, and all kinds of 'freedom and equality' slogans." It is as clear as fire that the women's rights movement cannot solve the current stage of China's women's problem.</p>
<p>In summary, we know that the Chinese women's problem, like those of other countries, is based on general social problems, and at the same time, in this general context, the women's problem has its own special significance and can still become an independent women's liberation movement. However, since the women's problem is based on the entire social problem, then the women's problem naturally cannot be solved separately from the entire social problem. In this era of the decline of world capitalism, especially in this semi-colonial China, wanting to rely solely on the women's rights movement "based on the principle of (men and women) equality, to jointly develop their knowledge and abilities and create a beautiful and free family and society" is probably just a surreal fantasy. Mr. Wang is not satisfied with personal achievements and still loudly cries out "weeping for the two hundred million pitiful women." This spirit is most admirable; however, at this time, to promote a narrow women's rights movement, even if it is not intentionally concealing more important social contradictions, I am afraid it will still be in vain. As the old saying goes, "Even a fool has something to offer in a thousand thoughts." I wonder if Mr. Wang is willing to accept this "foolish opinion," which may be called a "gain"?</p>
<h3 id="e218">After Reading "Letter to Editor Shi Yin of 'Women and Youth'" <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Hongshou</p>
<p>In a letter "To Editor Shi Yin of 'Women and Youth'" (see Shen Bao's Women's Corner, June 9th), Xiao Yin-jun (Mr. Wang Jiaoying) argued against Shi Yin-jun's statement, "The term 'women's rights movement' stirs up strife and is therefore not worth pursuing," saying, "Now that men are depriving women of their rights and freedoms, should we simply remain passive and allow 400 million women to be trampled under men's iron hooves?" She sees that men are at the center of politics, society, and family in China, but her view is narrow.</p>
<p>Considering the family unit—a husband and wife—created by two sexes, either the husband or wife could claim the family is his or her own. However, often, the husband alone works outside the home and provides for the family (exceptions exist). Thus, the husband is at the center of the family. This is based on the reality, not that men are occupying all the centers. It is women who are incapable and give up their role. This is true not only in China but in other countries as well.</p>
<p>We all know the saying: "The capable are employed, and the wise advise; those who labor with their hands are ruled by others, and those who labor with their minds rule." Unless there are differences in knowledge that create social hierarchies, no one can dominate another. Therefore, I disagree with Xiao Yin-jun's statement: "Men have become a special class toward women. The women's movement seeks to eliminate class between men and women. Men are in a dominant position, and their authority over women has reached its peak."</p>
<p>Xiao Yin-jun need not cite examples from the Family Law in the Civil Code, such as "After marriage, a woman should take her husband's surname and residence. Children should take their father's surname…" as strong evidence—as if she is her husband's possession, managing his household, and raising his children—that women's activities are controlled by men, and her life is like that of a domesticated animal in a farming family. In fact, the wife takes her husband's surname because the husband is more likely to represent the family and interact with the outside world, unifying the family's identity. The husband's residence is the family he and his wife created together, so the wife is living in her own home. There is no need to argue about these two points.</p>
<p>The children also take the father's surname, which is simply a consequence of the wife taking her husband's surname. However, even if children could take the mother's surname, men and women would still not be absolutely equal. Therefore, it is best to combine both parents' surnames. If this were implemented, the grandchildren would have four-character surnames. As for raising children, due to the husband's biological limitations, it is naturally the wife's responsibility. However, it should be clear that the children are the creation of both husband and wife, and the wife is not raising the husband's children alone. In short, everything is a voluntary obligation undertaken by the husband and wife in the spirit of mutual assistance, using their respective strengths. There is no reason for the husband to dominate the wife and make her work like an animal.</p>
<p>In terms of economics, Xiao Yin-jun also sees the Civil Code's statement that "Profits from a wife's property belong to the husband, who has the right to use her property…" as evidence of male economic aggression. Men are indeed excessive in this respect. I hope this can be corrected to prevent a husband's bankruptcy from causing the wife to go bankrupt as well. However, most women still do not engage in productive work and have no source of income. To fight over property inherited from parents or in-laws is ugly.</p>
<p>Xiao Yin-jun also says, "Besides political and economic aggression, men also use cultural aggression, such as advocating the education of 'virtuous women and good mothers'…" But if a wife is not virtuous and a mother is not good, how can they achieve gender equality and create a happy family? Therefore, this is not an aggressive policy by men. Instead, men should be questioned for not allowing women to act independently, and there should be an advocacy for the education of "virtuous husbands and good fathers." There is no aggression to speak of. Based on these reasons, women still have the potential to struggle. Unfortunately, most do not struggle or struggle in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>In conclusion, after reading Xiao Yin-jun's article, I believe she is relatively optimistic. However, I hope she will encourage women to engage in productive work and establish a better position for women, instead of engaging in superficial disputes about women's rights.</p>

<p>— Shen Zijiou</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Women's Corner, thanks to the help of friends and the correction of readers, although it cannot be said to have grown into a lush forest with a garden full of fruits, at least it has revealed some tender buds and green leaves.</p>
<p>Recently, with the efforts of our friends, we have opened up another new territory, named "Women's Life." It is a small monthly magazine of eighty to ninety thousand words. The news about it was disclosed in this publication a long time ago, and I think readers can still recall it. It will meet readers who love it around the beginning of July. In addition to the regular writers of the Women's Corner, such as Junhui, Baiwei, Biyao, Muhui, Qian, Biyun, Luo Qiong, Suwu, Zhanquan, Zigang, Guanlu, Fanying, Zhenyi, and Xianliang, Mr. Jin Zhonghua and Mr. Zhang Xichen are also helping me plan the road of development, and Mr. Shen Zhiyuan, Mr. Chen Fangzhi, and Mr. Xueyuan are lecturing us on the necessary knowledge of life; Mr. Zhang Yucai and Mr. Ren Yuan are collecting current events and facts and pictures about women's life abroad for us, Mr. Mao Dun is giving us short stories, and Mr. Xiling is giving us movie stories. These are not available in the Women's Corner. As for the detailed scenery, I hope readers will appreciate it themselves in the inaugural issue. The publisher is Shanghai Magazine Company, and for the benefit of readers, there is a special pre-order price, which will end at the end of July.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Editor's Note <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>"Which path should the Chinese women's movement take at the current stage?" Regarding this question, the 68th issue of this publication published an open letter from Mr. Wang Xiaoying, "A Letter to Editor Shi Yin of 'Women and Youth'," which I think readers can still recall. Within two weeks of the publication of the letter, we received as many as ten manuscripts discussing the issue. Among them, seven generally agreed with Mr. Wang Xiaoying's loud call, but believed that Mr. Wang Xiaoying's women's movement theory still had room for supplementation. The other three fundamentally opposed Mr. Wang Xiaoying's proposition, believing that the inequality between men and women today is natural. Now, we have selected one article from each of these two schools of thought and published them here. "The benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom," and readers will naturally be able to understand. In addition, Mr. Lin Gengbai sent "A Non-Critical Critique," which is a reply to Mr. Wang Xiaoying and Mr. Xu Zexiang of Chen Bao's "Contradictions in the Women's Liberation Movement." Due to space limitations, it will be published in the next issue.</p>

<h3 id="e221">"Small Farmer Cooperative Production" to Save the Rural Villages <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Jing</p>
<p>Eighty percent of the country's farmers are the lifeblood of our nation, and the one million rural villages across the country are its soul. However, examining the so-called lifeblood of our nation today, it truly only has its last breath remaining. And the so-called soul of our nation is already tending towards the dangerous path of death and extinction. The bankruptcy of rural villages has been shouted about with earth-shaking clamor, but to this day, there is still not a truly effective method to rescue the people from fire and water, or offer some benefit in reality.</p>
<p>The root causes of the difficult lives of farmers today are indeed extraordinarily complex. Such as the uneven distribution of land, the defects of the social system, and the extension of the giant claws of imperialist economic forces, all of which are contributing factors. However, the backwardness of agricultural production technology is the biggest factor contributing to farmers' lives nearing the brink of death. Therefore, instead of loudly singing about saving the country and merely creating empty promises, it would be better to start with improving production technology and increasing production efficiency, finding a path to survival for the wounded farmers, and allowing the collapsing rural villages to see a road of light. This would be a more sensible approach.</p>
<p>So, how can we improve production technology? How can we increase production efficiency? I believe the best method is "small farmer cooperative production."</p>
<p>Farmers have always been limited by the confines of their knowledge, their conservative inertia, and their self-interested selfishness, coupled with a lack of guidance and assistance. Therefore, farmers only adhere to old methods and do not know what new production techniques are, and naturally, they do not know the convenience, economy, and effectiveness of cooperative production. The result of them operating their own farms separately is that they not only waste labor and money, but also end up with a painful outcome of being unable to maintain their livelihoods.</p>
<p>Someone investigated the income of an average farmer's family in a certain county in Jiangnan:</p>
<p>They cultivate ten mu of land. The summer rice crop yields an average of one and a half shi per mu, averaging eight yuan per shi, totaling one hundred and twenty yuan. The winter wheat crop yields an average of eight dou per mu, averaging six yuan per shi, totaling forty-eight yuan. Rice and wheat stalks yield two yuan, totaling one hundred and seventy yuan in income. Subtracting three yuan per mu for fertilizer, the actual income after offsetting expenses is one hundred and forty yuan. An additional fifty-four yuan is earned from vegetables, livestock, and silkworm rearing, and forty yuan from other side occupations. The total annual income is two hundred and thirty-four yuan.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to Mr. Gu Fu's statistics, the annual living expenses for a family of five, including the elderly and young, are:</p>
<p>(1) Food expenses: rice and wheat cost thirty cents per day, nine yuan per month, and one hundred and eight yuan per year; vegetables and meat cost ten cents per day, thirty-six yuan per year; firewood, charcoal, salt, and soy sauce cost thirty-six yuan per year; (2) Clothing expenses: four yuan per person per year, totaling twenty yuan; (3) House repairs or rent cost twelve yuan per year; (4) Education expenses cost six yuan per year; (5) Socializing with relatives and friends for weddings and funerals costs ten yuan per year; (6) Medical expenses cost ten yuan per year; (7) Funeral expenses cost ten yuan (averaging one hundred yuan every ten years, amortized to ten yuan per year); (8) Taxes cost six yuan; (9) Miscellaneous expenses cost twenty yuan. The total annual expenditure is two hundred and seventy-four yuan.</p>
<p>According to the above statistics, such a farmer's family still has at least forty yuan missing each year. Moreover, we must recognize that this refers to places with fertile land, and years with average harvests. If the soil is barren, or if they encounter floods, droughts, or insect plagues, then their livelihoods are even more unimaginable.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we want to relieve the suffering of farmers and seek the prosperity of the entire nation, we must quickly plan effective methods to increase production, and quickly work together under the banner of cooperative production.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Many hands make light work, a single hand cannot clap," and "United will stands like a fortress, a single force cannot prevail." This is true for everything, but especially for agriculture. In the past, Chinese farmers, because they operated agriculture individually, had to provide all agricultural tools themselves. Therefore, if they wanted to adopt new agricultural machinery, individual farmers lacked the capital and were unable to do so, and thus the production effect was reduced. For example, during the severe drought in Jiangnan the year before last, the small rivers dried up, and because they could not jointly organize water pumping, they could only sit and wait for the rice fields to become withered. This is like a sick person who cannot afford to hire a doctor for treatment, and ultimately loses their life. How pitiful and lamentable is this! Normally, most farmers can only treat the immediate symptoms and do not think about improving old-fashioned agricultural tools. Therefore, whenever the weather is relatively dry, they rely entirely on manual or animal power to turn water scoops. Farmers often spend the entire summer wasting away from the labor of scooping water. As a result, the cost is high, but the effectiveness is limited, and in the event of a major drought, the effect is almost zero!</p>
<p>I dare to solemnly shout to the people of the country: If we want to save the suffering of farmers' lives and stabilize the foundation of the nation, we should unanimously advocate that all old methods of individual cultivation should be abolished as soon as possible, and that we should unite and move towards the new path of "cooperative production." Only cooperative production can destroy Asian-style production technology, and only cooperative production can utilize scientific production methods.</p>

<h3 id="e222">The Soon-to-be-Completed Singapore Naval Base <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Mei</p>
<p>Malaya Peninsula Correspondence</p>
<p>Singapore is a small island in the southern part of the Malaya Peninsula. Five hundred years ago, it was still a desolate fishing village. However, since the invasion of European powers, in the last century, this desolate fishing village has transformed into the world's ninth-largest port. Now, Britain is working hard to build the Singapore naval base, strengthening Singapore's naval base, which is expected to be completed within this year. According to British military journalists, after completion, the Singapore naval base will be the fourth most excellent combat base in the world.</p>
<p>As early as 1919, Admiral Jellicoe, after inspecting the Far East, suggested that the British government build the Singapore naval</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>base. In April 1923, the Conservative cabinet formally decided to begin construction. However, in 1924, when MacDonald's Labour cabinet was formed, the implementation plan for building the Singapore naval base was suspended on the grounds of arms reduction and peace in the Far East. When the Conservative Party returned to power in 1925, the proposal to build the Singapore naval base was revived. However, the time when active construction began was after 1932, or more specifically, after the Japan's seizing of Northeast China incident.</p>
<p>The British initially budgeted 11 million pounds for the construction of the Singapore naval base, which was later reduced to 7.75 million pounds, but last year's budget increased to 8.93 million pounds. The location of this base is very deep, with no wind or waves, and can accommodate a large number of giant ships. At the same time, there are large-scale naval and air force airfields, planned to accommodate at least 1,000 aircraft. In recent years, Britain has spent a lot of money here to complete breakwaters, radio stations, floating docks, oil storage tanks, and large-scale land fortresses. Now, this huge construction project is actively underway. The original number of workers employed was only 5,000, but has now increased to 14,500. Among them, there are 8,000 Chinese, 4,000 Malays, and 2,000 Indians. For the sake of "military secrecy," the fortress and naval base areas are prohibited from being observed, so all we can see here are groups of workers transporting materials such as iron bars and steel columns, many "Royal Air Force" planes flying in the sky from time to time, the actions of the British Empire's army, navy, and air force, and searchlights shining all night long.</p>
<p>Singapore is the center of the Europe-Asia shipping route and the hub of the South Seas islands. It is 6,000 nautical miles from the British main fleet's base at Moorshead, and only 1,600 nautical miles from Japan's Sasebo. If the distance between Singapore and Sasebo or Nagasaki is compared with the distance from Pearl Harbor to Yokohama (3,400 nautical miles), the former is much closer. Therefore, from Japan's perspective, Britain's construction of the Singapore naval base is not only to defend its territories in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, but also to threaten Sasebo, Taiwan, and Japan. In fact, in recent years, due to the active development of Japanese power towards China and the South Seas, Britain has indeed felt greatly uneasy. The active construction of the Singapore naval base is indeed an attempt to maintain its hegemony in the Far East, and also to defend against Japan. The fact that this construction project only began to be actively implemented after the Northeast China Incident shows the intentions of the British Empire. Recently, it has been heard that Tokyo has plans to lend money to the Siamese government to build a canal across the Kra Isthmus in Siam. If this canal is completed, not only will all of Singapore's commercial value be taken away, but the military value of the Singapore naval base will also be reduced. Conservative members of the British House of Commons have made the following remarks about this matter: "The plan for Siam to build a canal is worthy of discussion, as it is said to be built with funds borrowed from Japan. If this plan is realized, it will have a great impact on our military fortress in the Malay Peninsula. We must not forget the opening of the Panama Canal, which has great naval and military importance in the Western Hemisphere." From this, we can not only see the importance the British attach to their "military fortress in the Malay Peninsula," but also the conflict between Britain and Japan in the Far East.</p>
<p>Recently, Japan has been very active in Singapore, and Britain's defenses have also been tightened. Therefore, although it seems "quiet" on the surface, in reality it is as if the Pacific War has already broken out, and the atmosphere is very tense.</p>
<p>Singapore has four to five hundred thousand residents, two-thirds of whom are Chinese. However, these Chinese compatriots, under the rule of the British Empire, have not only failed to pay attention to the national crisis in their motherland, but even cannot speak Chinese! The languages they use are English and Malay dialects. If you do not understand English and Malay dialects, when you come to Singapore, you will not be able to talk to the Chinese compatriots here.</p>

<p>— Shen Qianli</p>
<p>It was a sunny afternoon when I met Mr. Rong Zongjing in his writing room. A short old man with an unremarkable appearance and plain clothes was sitting at a large desk. Anyone who walked in would not believe that this was the "King of Flour" who owned nine yarn factories and eight flour mills. No wonder I asked, "Is Mr. Rong Zongjing here?" after seeing him in person.</p>
<p>As I walked into this simply furnished writing room, Mr. Rong stood up and walked towards me to greet me.</p>
<p>"What can I do for you?" he asked with a cheerful smile on his face.</p>
<p>"I've come especially to visit you and to learn about the process of how you started your business."</p>
<p>"Ah!" he smiled again, saying in his thick Wuxi accent, "My surname is Rong!"</p>
<p>"Oh... I'm very sorry. Because I've never met you before, I didn't recognize you in person." I felt small, and my face was hot, as if I had eaten chili peppers.</p>
<p>"Please sit down!" he said, pressing a doorbell on the wall. After a while, a servant brought in two cups of tea, and he exchanged courtesies with me for a while.</p>
<p>"You don't need to be so polite," I said, slightly shifting my body. "Mr. Rong, do you come here to work every day?"</p>
<p>"I come every day. I'm the same as them (referring to the staff). I come to the writing room at nine o'clock in the morning and two o'clock in the afternoon, and I don't go back for meals until twelve o'clock in the morning and six o'clock in the afternoon."</p>
<p>"That's very hard work," I said.</p>
<p>"It doesn't feel like it. I've been doing this for decades, and now it's become a habit. I'd rather be here than idle at home all day."</p>
<p>"Of course, doing such a big business requires a hardworking spirit. Mr. Rong, do you have to inspect the factories in Shanghai every day?"</p>
<p>"No, because there are people in charge on the side, so I don't necessarily have to go every day, and I wouldn't have enough time. I have more than a dozen yarn factories and flour mills in Shanghai. If I had to inspect each factory once, it would take a whole day." He couldn't help but laugh proudly.</p>
<p>"Mr. Rong, you run so many yarn factories, how is it that you are famous for flour?" I asked curiously.</p>
<p>"There's a reason for that. I thank them for calling me the King of Flour." He took a sip of tea and continued, "It's a long story. I used to run a small business in Wuxi, but I still made some money every year. However, I always felt that this kind of business, although profitable, was not directly beneficial to the people's livelihood. Later, when I came to Shanghai, I saw that a large number of foreign goods were being imported, especially yarn, cloth, and flour, which are related to people's clothing and food. Looking back at the country, no one was paying attention to this industry, so I pooled together several tens of thousands of yuan in capital and started the Fuxin Flour Company. At first, I only opened one factory. Of course! At that time, the scale was very rudimentary, and there was no question of competing with foreign goods, but at least I had recovered a little bit of the leakage in the import surplus of foreign goods. After the first Fuxin factory opened, there was still some money to be earned every year, so I relied on this surplus profit to expand from one factory to two, three, and four factories. Soon, the European War broke out, and the light and heavy industries of various countries were affected by the war and declared closure one after another. The import of foreign goods was not as much as before. Especially flour and cloth. Because they had to supply military needs at that time, later not only was there no surplus to transport to China, but they even had to buy from China. In the four years of the European War, Fuxin sold as many as nine million bags of flour. At that time, the price of each bag of flour was only one yuan higher than that sold in the country. Of course, thanks to the European War, Fuxin earned several million yuan, and my title of "King of Flour" became famous from then on. But at that time, the domestic production of cloth was not enough to supply the demand, and there were not many foreign goods coming in, so the price of cloth became more and more expensive, and the general civilians who could not afford silk were directly affected by this. In this year, I proposed to open the Shenxin Yarn Factory, hoping to solve the current difficult problem from this aspect. Things went very smoothly, and seven yarn factories were established in the first year. But in the second year, because all the funds were concentrated in the yarn factories, there was a period when there was a lack of cash flow, and the debt was several million. The general onlookers were very worried about me at this time, fearing that the future of my business would encounter insurmountable dangers. I myself was very clear about this situation, but I was not flustered at all. In this year, I just buried my head in hard work to cope with the current difficult environment. Sure enough, in the second year's final settlement period, I unexpectedly earned several million yuan, and after paying off all the debts, the working capital also increased. At this time, the British-owned Sanxin Yarn Factory was selling, and I spent several million yuan to take it over. The current Shenxin No. 9 Factory is the reincarnation of the former Sanxin Yarn Factory. However, after I took it over, I spent more than 2.4 million yuan to rebuild all the factory buildings and workers' residences." He said, taking a sip of tea and lightly smacking his lips, as if there was still a lot of aftertaste.</p>
<p>I became more and more interested as I listened, as if listening to a story, and said with a smile, "Mr. Rong is not only the 'King of Flour,' but also a leader in the yarn industry!"</p>
<p>"I wouldn't dare to say that," he shook his head and said, "but I always want to do more businesses that are directly related to the people. Like cloth and flour, I am very interested in them. If there is an opportunity in the future, I may do one or two more industries that are more beneficial to the people's livelihood."</p>
<p>"Mr. Rong, you have such a large fortune now, so your personal life must be..."</p>
<p>"My personal life?" He laughed before I could finish my sentence. "Except for having a car more than ordinary people, everything else is the same as everyone else. Look, almost everything I wear is produced by my own factory. It can be said that I haven't bought a foot of cloth from a cloth shop in the past few years. As for buying odds and ends, the family takes care of it. I myself don't even spend ten yuan a year."</p>
<p>"I heard that you have several young masters, who have probably also been influenced by Mr. Rong and live a very simple life, right?"</p>
<p>"There are three children in total. Two of them are still in charge of some things, and the youngest is studying. My brothers don't mess around. I don't want my children to act like young masters, because China currently needs people who can work hard. When I first started Fuxin Factory, I don't know how many difficulties I encountered, but I have never failed to deal with them calmly. And if a business does not experience these several failures, people will take it very ordinary and will not put in the effort to do it."</p>

<h3 id="e224">The Decline of French Democracy <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Pu</p>
<p>France is the nation where the democratic revolution was most thorough and the birthplace of modern democracy. Therefore, France has always respected "human rights" and "freedom." After the Great War, France further leveraged the control power of the Treaty of Versailles. Internally, it benefited from substantial reparations and other advantages, leading to relatively stable national economy and finances. Externally, the effectiveness of the Versailles system and the role of the League of Nations allowed it to dominate Europe. Thus, while crises arose in Germany, Austria, and other countries after the war, France's political situation remained relatively stable, and the so-called tendency towards extreme politics did not yet emerge. However, good times do not last forever. Since the global economic panic of 1929, the prosperity of capitalist France has been swept away by this wave of panic. As a result, phenomena such as overproduction, trade decline, increased unemployment, rural panic, credit depression, bank closures, and financial crises have increasingly occurred and developed in France. At the same time, France often encountered setbacks in diplomacy. It is evident that Britain, unwilling to see France dominate Europe after the war, frequently created difficulties for it in various aspects. For example, it secretly supported Germany's rearmament and openly advocated for naval equality between France and Italy. Its opposition to Briand's Danube Union plan is a clear illustration. After Hitler came to power, the Versailles system was further destroyed, making France's hegemony even more precarious. Considering France's relations with other European countries, Poland, once its best ally, has seen its foreign policy in Warsaw completely diverge from Paris's intentions in recent years. Germany and Poland have formed an alliance and are aligned in many areas. Similarly, Austria-Hungary was also a country closest to France, but as the conflict between France and Germany intensified, France had to turn a blind eye to Italy's growing influence in Central Europe, drawing Austria-Hungary over. Furthermore, the Little Entente, historically known as France's satellites, has seen centrifugal forces between Yugoslavia and France increasingly develop in recent years, and the system of the Little Entente is in danger of gradually disintegrating. Since Göring's visit to the Balkans and his friendship with Yugoslavia, this danger is even more likely to become a reality. Currently, only the Soviet Union is on good terms with France, but whether the Soviet Union truly stands on the same front as France remains a significant question. From this, we can say that France has suffered diplomatic failures in recent years. Recently, due to Germany's rearmament, the stalled Eastern European Pact, and the establishment of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, France's position in Europe has been greatly threatened. After the establishment of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, the Frenchman Soulzhi wrote an article stating: "Three months ago, Germany reorganized its army and implemented conscription without France's consent, an act that severely struck the dignity of the victorious nations and the treaty. Today, Germany has obtained the consent of Britain, the United States, and Japan to reorganize its navy, making France feel even more deeply wounded! Other countries disregard France's interests; it is now too late for France to force Germany to accept its will!" This is indeed speaking honestly. Thus, France, afflicted by domestic economic panic and financial crisis, and repeatedly failing in diplomacy, inevitably faces an unstable political situation. Judging from the recent situation, it is likely that French politics will take an extreme path, and the life of its democratic politics is in danger of being cut off.</p>
<p>France's situation differs from that of Britain, the United States, and other countries. It does not have large political parties; instead, it is a country where many small parties coexist. In terms of the composition of these small parties and the policies they pursue, they can be divided into three major forces: the left wing, the right wing, and the center wing. In the past, because French society was relatively stable and only needed international coordination externally, the more moderate Radical Socialist Party, representing the liberal citizenry, had repeatedly formed cabinets. However, in recent years, under conditions of economic panic, financial crisis, and diplomatic difficulties, the cabinets of the Radical Socialist Party could not be maintained. First, the Herriot cabinet fell on the issue of war debts, and then the Penggu cabinet resigned due to the budget bill. Following this were the successive collapses of the Daladier, Sarraut, and Chautemps cabinets. After Daladier's second cabinet formation, various right-leaning groups in France held riots in Paris over the Bayonne-Stavisky affair. At the same time, left-wing parties such as the Socialist Party staged a counter-demonstration, turning the normally tranquil France into a turbulent city. The result was the fall of the Daladier cabinet, followed by the formation of the Doumergue cabinet, representing a truce among political parties and national unity. Because Doumergue was a relatively right-leaning figure, the formation of the Doumergue cabinet not only interrupted the Radical Socialist Party's continued cabinet formations but also marked the beginning of the rise of right-leaning politics in France.</p>
<p>Shortly after its formation, the Doumergue cabinet collapsed due to the Radical Socialist Party's opposition to the constitutional reform bill. It was succeeded by the Flandin cabinet. However, the Flandin cabinet was recently overthrown due to the financial plenipotentiary bill. The ensuing Bouisson cabinet lasted only three days, its life cut short by a two-vote difference on the financial plenipotentiary bill. Currently, the Laval cabinet has been formed, and the financial plenipotentiary bill has been passed by both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. On the surface, the cabinet turmoil in France has temporarily subsided, but even in the recent past cabinet turmoil, one can see the serious situation of the struggle between the two extreme forces in France.</p>
<p>From the Doumergue cabinet to the Laval cabinet, although there have been some changes in form, in reality, it can be said that it is the development of right-leaning politics in France. It is clear that Doumergue was a figure close to the right wing, Flandin was even the instigator of the Paris events, and Laval was the foreign minister of the Flandin cabinet. According to a Paris newspaper, the Laval government plans to issue substitute legal decrees authorized by the parliament from July 1, with the following content: (1) Reduce or abolish certain types of pensions. (2) Abolish retirement pensions for current military personnel who participated in the war. (3) Abolish secondary railway branch lines and reduce railway personnel. (4) Gradually reduce redundant staff, abolish concurrent positions and certain types of public expenses, and abolish overtime work bonuses. (5) Abolish certain administrative agencies. (6) Revise the social insurance system. If this news is true, then just from this point alone, we can say that the right-leaning performance of the Laval cabinet is even more advanced than that of the Flandin cabinet.</p>
<p>Currently, although the political situation in France is relatively stable on the surface due to the passage of the Laval cabinet's financial plenipotentiary bill, its political crisis is developing day by day. In fact, the "Action Française" organized by the monarchists has recently held demonstrations, destroying the small newspaper advocating for the devaluation of the franc. The "Croix-de-Feu" composed of veterans is now posting slogans all over the country, shouting: "The national treasury is now empty, peace is in jeopardy, the people hope for work and bread, the government that wants to prevent speculation has been overthrown by the parliament within 24 hours, the right-wing members who are slaves to capitalism and the left-wing members who are slaves to Marx are preparing for civil war, we advocate stopping it immediately!" Former Prime Minister Tardieu also opposes the parliamentary system and advocates establishing a strong government to cope with today's "economic difficulties." At the same time, the leaders of the left-wing Socialist Party also explicitly declared that they can cope with all events, and the joint meeting of left-wing parties has also discussed the issue of re-electing the parliament to produce a majority party. Seeing the active activities of the "Croix-de-Feu" and the "National Volunteers," the Radical Socialist Party has decided at its recent caucus meeting to continue holding caucus meetings during the parliamentary recess and to request that the parliamentary committees also continue to meet during the recess. The severity of the situation is evident!</p>
<p>In such a serious situation, we can clearly see that the two extremes of conflict in France are developing. The future of this development will inevitably be the victory of one aspect of the two extremes (left or right), because judging from the current domestic and international situation in France, there is no possibility of victory for moderate sentimentalism. The so-called modern "democracy politics" in France is also in danger of being cut off, and the realization of this danger, judging from the current situation, cannot be said to be in the distant future; perhaps it is happening right now!</p>

<h3 id="e225">An Evening Chat on Language Problems <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Ju</p>
<p>A: I promised to talk to you about language problems tonight, but because I've been very busy, I haven't prepared well. It would be best if you raise the questions and I answer them.</p>
<p>B: Thank you for making the special trip. Please sit down and talk! The first thing I want to ask is, what is the purpose of Latinizing Chinese?</p>
<p>A: Its purpose is to make the literacy movement easier to succeed so that the illiterate masses who can only speak but not read and write can have a writing system. We know that Chinese pictographs are really too…</p>
<p>B: Too difficult, right?</p>
<p>A: That's right, too difficult. It takes several years to learn a few thousand characters. To be able to freely read and write, it probably takes at least ten years of effort. And most people's lives aren't very good; they really don't have the time or financial means to learn this kind of writing system. That's the first thing.</p>
<p>B: What's the second?</p>
<p>A: The shortcoming of Chinese characters isn't just that they're "difficult," but also that they're "bad." Chinese characters are not suitable for ordinary people's use; they make people "interpret words literally," they can't match spoken language, they're not suitable for children, and they can't accept internationalized roots. That's the second point.</p>
<p>B: Are you saying that we Chinese should abandon thousands of years of Chinese characters and instead learn the foreign devils' gibberish?</p>
<p>A: That's right, Latinization wants to abolish Chinese characters, but the Latinized writing system is still Chinese. The language is Chinese, but it's spelled with Latin letters. So the Latinized Chinese writing system is definitely not the "gibberish" you mentioned. That's the first thing. Second, Latin letters are by no means something that foreigners exclusively own.</p>
<p>B: If they're not the foreign devils', then whose are they?</p>
<p>A: They belong to everyone. Latin letters have gone through many evolutions, and now they have become international things. Not only do I have to use A+B+C... when learning algebra, but also the names of medicines prescribed by doctors, the names of train stations in China and Japan, post office stamps, typewriters, signal flags, ... all need Latin letters. Can you say it's not international? Haha, even the shirt you're wearing is from ABC Company!</p>
<p>B: But I don't understand. Why doesn't Latinization adopt a standard language to unify the whole country, but instead Latinize dialects? Isn't this splitting the Chinese people?</p>
<p>A: First, you need to know that people are not unified by language. The unity and opposition between people are determined by their material interests. Among people with consistent interests, no matter what method you use, you can't prevent their "unity." Conversely, among people with conflicting interests, even if they speak the same language, they have to "oppose" each other. Second, there is currently no nationally unified spoken language in China. You want something that "doesn't exist" to "exist" immediately; not only can Latinization not do it, but neither can any other -ization.</p>
<p>B: Then aren't Chinese characters nationally unified?</p>
<p>A: That's right, Chinese characters are nationally unified. But only two out of ten Chinese people understand Chinese characters. The existence or non-existence of Chinese characters has almost nothing to do with ordinary people. Because of the existence of Chinese characters, they haven't benefited in any way, but have suffered a lot!</p>
<p>B: Then suppose one day, ordinary people's lives get better, and they have time and money. Would it be possible to learn Chinese characters at that time?</p>
<p>A: I don't think so, even if it's as you said, they wouldn't need to do so. Because I've already said that the problem with Chinese characters isn't just that they're "difficult," but also that they're "bad." We already have very good things; why would we want this bad thing again? It's like having steamboats and sailboats; there's no need to sit in a dugout canoe anymore.</p>
<p>B: Then are you saying that you don't want a unified language for the rest of your lives?</p>
<p>A: That's not right. Latinization not only doesn't oppose it but also advocates having a unified language. But the unified language of Latinization is not to force the local dialect of one place on the whole country. Latinization's method is to develop dialects, promote their intermingling, and help the formation of a unified language. Dialects are not the permanent goal of Latinization; we are not "for dialects for the sake of dialects." Dialects are a historical category. With the progress of society and the economy, dialects will inevitably disappear and form a unified language, and finally even a universal language for the whole world. So the Latinization of dialects is a temporary transitional means to achieve a unified national language.</p>
<p>B: Do you mean to let dialects develop naturally and wait for them to form a unified language?</p>
<p>A: Definitely not like that. The formation of a unified language has its objective conditions—changes in the socio-economic structure, the development of transportation, frequent mutual contact and exchange of experiences (oral and written) between people in different places. But there must also be subjective conditions—and that is the progress of culture and education, and in this regard, the vigorous implementation of dialect Latinization and the intermingling of dialects must be the most powerful factors. Objective conditions are certainly fundamental, but if you only rely on the progress of objective conditions without adding subjective promotion and control, the result is often slow, relying on experience without theory, and even taking detours and suffering unnecessary sacrifices.</p>
<p>B: But suppose once Chinese characters are abolished and all places start using Latinization, won't we be returning to an era without writing? For example, if someone from Shanghai goes to Guangdong for investigation or travel, when there are Chinese characters, they can still use the help of Chinese characters to read local newspapers and understand the price lists in hotels and trams, and the menus in restaurants. They can investigate or travel freely. But after the implementation of Latinization, they will find it difficult to move even an inch, as if they have arrived in a foreign country!</p>
<p>A: First, Latinization does not plan to abolish Chinese characters immediately. In the early stages of Latinization, Chinese characters can still exist for a period of time. People who understand Chinese characters will naturally continue to use them, although the scope of use of Chinese characters will gradually narrow and eventually be abandoned. So, to think that after Latinization, we will return to an era without writing is completely an unnecessary worry. Second, I want to ask you what kind of person the Shanghainese you mentioned is. If you're talking about those people whose lives aren't very good, then how can they have the blessing to "investigate" and "travel" to Guangdong? And coolies never look at the menu when they go into small restaurants to eat. So even when there are still Chinese characters, Chinese characters have not given them any convenience, and it is common for them to suffer because of Chinese characters. As for when Latinization becomes widespread, firstly, the transmission and learning of dialects in each region will be extremely easy at that time, and secondly, even if only the writing of the local area is simple, newspapers, price lists, and menus can be printed or written in the writing of each region at that time. Doesn't Shanghai currently have newspapers in five or six languages, and aren't there price lists in English, French, and Chinese on trams, and aren't the menus of Russian restaurants in both Chinese and Russian? Currently, if there is really a Shanghai coolie who can "investigate" in Guangdong, even with Chinese characters, they will find it "difficult to move even an inch, as if they have arrived in a foreign country." But after Latinization is implemented, even without Chinese characters, they can still "investigate or travel freely." If the Shanghainese you're talking about is a comprador in a foreign firm, then it's even less of a problem. Even if they really "arrive in a foreign country," they can bring a translator with them and will definitely not find it "difficult to move even an inch." But Latinization originally had no intention of meddling in whether or not it is convenient for them. In short, judging from your tone, it seems that you are still thinking about the people who already know Chinese characters, and not about the illiterate masses. We must know that since the existence of Chinese characters has nothing to do with ordinary people, they will definitely not suffer because of the abolition of Chinese characters. In the process of Latinization, they have nothing to lose, but something to gain: that is obvious. B judging from your tone, it seems that you advocate immediately using Latinized writing to teach the illiterate, but may I ask, what use is it after learning Latinization? Aren't most of the current newspapers, magazines, and books printed in Chinese characters? A Your question is very reasonable! But I want to ask you in return: how many of the current newspapers printed in Chinese characters are really suitable for the masses to read? What kinds of magazines and books are suitable for them to read? Even if they ate an elixir and could read Chinese characters from tomorrow, they would feel that there is nothing to read. So even if all the illiterate knew Chinese characters, the problem would not be completely solved. Latinization is still in the promotion period, so currently there is nothing for them to read, just like with Chinese characters. But with the spread of Latinization, if those engaged in Latinization can actively compile and print some popular reading materials, after just one year, I'm afraid the masses who already know a little Chinese characters will have nothing to read if they don't pick up Latinization.</p>
<p>B: Then what are your opinions on the "variant characters" advocated by Hu Yuzhi?</p>
<p>A: Although one or two people have supported his advocacy, even he himself has not used "variant characters" to write a second article. From this point, it can be seen how difficult his method is to implement. Moreover, I have always felt that his so-called "variant characters" are not really variant characters, but simplified characters. For example, he uses "贾直" (jia zhi) to replace "价值" (jia zhi, value), instead of using "介之" (jie zhi), which has fewer strokes, is one example. I once carefully did a statistic of the article he published in "Taibai," and the result was that only two or three words were written entirely in variant characters, such as writing "拥护" (yong hu, support) as "永户" (yong hu), and the rest were composed of simplified characters or one variant character and one correct character. Unfortunately, I don't have that piece of paper with me, otherwise I could give you the specific numbers. The most that his method can achieve, that is, the most ideal situation, is the alphabetization of Chinese characters, with each group of homophonic Chinese characters represented by one Chinese character. However, in the Northern dialect, there are about 450 groups of homophonic Chinese characters, which means that his alphabet would have 450 letters, which is more than 420 more than Latinization!</p>
<p>B: Finally, I would also like to hear your opinion on handwritten characters.</p>
<p>A: Handwritten characters mix into the ranks of Chinese characters (correct characters), disrupt the rear of Chinese characters, tear off its dignified coat, and promote its disintegration—in this respect, it can be said to be an ally of Latinization. But its role is limited to this, and it has no active significance beyond that. Moreover, handwritten characters have a very big crisis, which is that as soon as they come out, some people give them too high an evaluation, as if once handwritten characters become popular, the Chinese language problem will be solved. In fact, the change in the shape of the characters, and most of them are just a reduction in strokes, can only provide some writing convenience for people who already know, slightly know, and will know Chinese characters, and there is nothing else. —Oh, it's getting late, see you tomorrow.</p>
<p>B: It's truly "listening to you for one evening is better than reading books for ten years." Let's see each other tomorrow.</p>
<p>Art Scene</p>
<h3 id="e226">Watching the Rehearsal of "Modern Lady" <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>When I arrived at the Lakeside Society, it was only half-past eight, but the audience was already full. It took a bit of time to find a seat. I was waiting for the performance of this tragedy with a skeptical gaze. The actors in this play had only trained for three months, but after watching this rehearsal, I really felt a bit surprised! The detailed situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Script: Although it is just a love story, it has considerable value in artistic achievement due to the ingenuity of the composition technique.</p>
<p>Actors: Hong Ying, who plays Shen Xiujuan, performs very fittingly, and her dissolute and bold behavior is very tasteful. Lu Ping, who plays Xiujuan's husband, has natural and calm movements and expressions, but his voice seemed a bit hoarse that day. Dai Hao, who plays Zou Yisheng, has a naturally slippery face and can also perform with great attention to detail. Others, like Yang Duo, Cheng Jingzi, Bai Xiongchang, Fan Yanfu, Huang Yun, Xu Lilin, and Qian Feng, are all extremely competent in the roles they play. In short, in the entire performance, in the performance of each actor, I can say that there is considerable success.</p>
<p>Lighting: It is said that it was temporarily rented, but the results were not bad.</p>
<p>Set design: There is also nothing to criticize, except that the movements were a bit too slow when the two acts were replaced, which slightly made people feel unpleasant.</p>
<p>Other: In terms of dubbing, it is also very consistent with the plot. However, if the tragic scene in the fifth act could be aided by the power of music to increase the audience's sympathy, it would probably make the plot more vivid!</p>
<h3 id="e227">After Watching "The Beginning of Man" <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>The Yihua sound film "The Beginning of Man," which recently premiered at the Jincheng Grand Theater, can be said to be a good film worth watching in all aspects. What particularly interested me was that this film also touched on the issue of language and writing.</p>
<p>Boatman Zhang Ronggen and his wife, due to the difficulty of making a living, sent their newly born child, Ren Di, to the wealthy gentleman Huang Zijing to be his son. The grief of Ronggen and his wife in sending away "their own flesh" to someone else is needless to say. After taking the child to Huang's house, Mr. Huang came out with a written contract and asked, "Ronggen, can you read?"</p>
<p>"I know a few words, sir, please read it once!" Tears were shining.</p>
<p>In Mr. Huang's solemn reading, Ronggen and his wife were trembling and sobbing. They didn't understand what was written on it. They didn't need to understand; in the end, they affixed their seals. The rough hands accustomed to holding oars tightly grasped a thin pen, the hand trembling, holding back tears, and drew a cross in the low weeping of his wife.</p>
<p>Ronggen's wife had worked in Mr. Huang's factory for more than ten years and had become a cripple, sick in bed all day, calling out the name of Ren Di, who had already become the young master. Ronggen, in order to comfort his dying wife, planned to go to the accounting room to steal a photo of the young master Ren Di, but was caught and taken to court as a petty thief. Ronggen said that the young master was his own son. The judge asked:</p>
<p>"What evidence do you have?"</p>
<p>"There is a piece of paper," Ronggen replied.</p>
<p>"What does it say?" the judge asked.</p>
<p>"..." Ronggen couldn't answer; he couldn't even find the piece of paper. So he was put on trial as a petty thief.</p>
<p>This is precisely the greatest effect of the current Chinese characters, a concrete example of how pictographic Chinese characters serve people like Mr. Huang.</p>
<p>In addition, the Suzhou dialect folk song that Xiaogen and Jindi sang during their love affair, and the Suzhou dialect storytelling broadcast on the radio, also show that the director used dialects very appropriately.

<h3 id="e229">The Revival of the Queen of Science (Part 1) <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>Those who study philosophy often fear being asked, "What is philosophy?" but they fear even more being asked, "What is the use of philosophy?" This is a question in the history of philosophy. From the great Greek philosopher Socrates onwards, all the way to the medieval scholastic school, which specialized in playing tricks with syllogisms without studying practical issues externally, philosophy was a living science. It studied everything in the universe, was respected by people, regarded as a guide for personal conduct, and revered as the queen of science. But after the Middle Ages, philosophy became dead. Descartes said, "I think, therefore I am." He placed everything in the universe in thought and then passed thought through the immaterial soul, "I." Could this solve the problems of life? Since philosophy began engaging in debates within the ivory tower of epistemology, not only has its territory been almost entirely occupied by science, but it has also been met with cold looks and forgotten by people. You see, in modern philosophy, it no longer studies practical life issues, but has become dry questions of mind and matter, questions of substance and phenomena, questions of reason and sensation.</p>
<p>The above continues from page five.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>Forgetting the search for truth and wisdom, forgetting the influence on the meaning of life, philosophy is on the road to ruin.</p>
<p>Now, let's take another look at real life! Since the flourishing of science and the Industrial Revolution in the nineteenth century, people have lived in a trivial, disturbing, and mechanical world. The natural principles of morality and religious belief have been destroyed. Luxurious and sensual life has replaced asceticism, and restless stimulation has replaced contentment. Chemical warfare is lurking everywhere. All new perspectives on sexual relationships and even illusions of the soul are wriggling on the earth. Except for mechanism and fatalism, people can no longer find a destination for life. As for philosophy itself, the former cosmology has become astronomy and geophysics, the former "natural science" has become biology and physics, and the current "spiritual philosophy" will become psychology. "Philosophy is finished!" Everyone may shout in unison!</p>
<p>But, is philosophy really finished? No! You see, what mathematicians indicate are just abstract theories and dry programs. What biologists are debating are the issues of "gradual change," "mutation," "innate," and "acquired." Although psychologists emphasize the analysis of behavior, they are also just terms such as "brain," "glands," "senses," "muscles," "response," and "stimulus," etc., which are difficult to contribute to practical life issues. This task can only be undertaken by philosophy. Philosophy will delineate the entire perspective, encompass all of life, and seek a consistent spiritual endeavor from a chaotic state, including various issues that can affect the value and meaning of life. Philosophy must, like science, use some method to "compensate" for the "deficiencies" of life, just as medicine compensates for diseases, and these deficiencies arise from desires.</p>
<p>There is a slogan now, which is that there is only a philosophy of life, not philosophy. In fact, it only observed a part and did not deeply investigate the whole. We know that everything in the universe only has value when it is related to human desires—just like studying economics—; but desires are changeable and impermanent, and only philosophy can make them consistent or coordinated; this is difficult to achieve with knowledge and tools (science). This is the issue of science and philosophy. For example, a scientist, regarding chlorine, only says what the compounds or components of chlorine are and what its effects are. However, the study of the ultimate issues in life, such as whether human culture, virtues, knowledge, works of art, and all constructions should be destroyed, is the task of philosophy. Also, for example, a black woman with dark skin and lips is clearly considered extremely beautiful by a great man of the same race. Is a life immersed in wealth sweet? Or is a life bathed in creation sweet? These many questions cannot be illuminated by science. This is the difference between science and philosophy. Then can philosophy become a scholastic school without science? This is also wrong. Because if human wisdom does not have science as a foundation, it cannot grow to maturity, and may even become corrupt and dishonest, and become alienated from human life. At the same time, if science has no philosophical meaning, it becomes cruel and meaningless. They are mutually dependent. To sum up the above, the tasks of philosophy are roughly these: (1) To study the ultimate and final questions with a comprehensive perspective; (2) To use various sciences as the foundation of the entirety of the universe, reside above science, and use a condescending "attitude" to solve problems that science cannot solve (such as the universe and life); (3) To peel away phenomena and study the noumenon (science studies phenomena, such as natural phenomena and social phenomena, while philosophy studies the noumenon, such as mind and matter).

<p>Moonlight's first all-singing, all-talking giant film "Sound Madness" will be released simultaneously in four ports. As the release date approaches, the four new copies are being rushed out. Due to time constraints, the coloring work in the film cannot be as extensive as expected. However, everything in "Sound Madness" will surely satisfy the audience.</p>
<p>The Moonlight Special Issue was originally scheduled to be released with "Sound Madness," but due to the busy schedules of various departments, the photography and plate-making cannot be completed on time, so it will be delayed by one or two periods before meeting readers.</p>
<p>With the release of "Sound Madness," the "Sound Madness" song will be broadcast on the air. The record is No. 34919, issued by the Baidai Company, and is available in various record stores.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Paris Premieres Spring Light of Formosa <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>The film "Spring Light of Formosa" is a great production of Paramount Company in 1935, costing more than 800,000 gold to complete. The entire film is colorful and dazzling. The plot tells that the people of Bali Island in India are bound by religion. If a young girl is rejected by a man's love, she is considered a great shame and must be cremated. The film was a sensation at its premiere at the Da Guangming. This time, it's making a comeback and is said to be playing at the Paris Theater starting yesterday. The audience is very crowded, so those who want to see the film should not miss it.</p>

<p>First-Class Staff</p>
<p>Not only are the actors in this "Nora" performance all stars and veterans from the film and theater circles, but the stage staff are also all first-class figures in the Shanghai stage. For example, Fan Bozi and Ouyang Shanzun's lighting, Song Xiaojiang's makeup, Zheng Shanzun's props, Zhu Jinming's installations, Yang Qiming's photography, and Wang Qi's costumes are all members of various large and small performances, which can be said to be a collection of the most outstanding staff in the film and theater circles.</p>
<p>Stage Installation Releases a Special Radiance</p>
<p>Chinese stage installations have generally been taken from Japan or the United States. Recently, American-style scenery has become more popular on Chinese stages. Watching this kind of scenery that often does not change will show the superficiality and low-level taste of the performance. This "Nora" performance, like the Reinhardt Theater, collects multifaceted stage designs to complete a realistic 19th-century set. The carvings on the walls and the window decorations have all been carefully studied, which can be said to break the current record of stage design.</p>
<p>The Trilogy of Lights</p>
<p>The lighting of the Nora performance is the responsibility of Ouyang Shanzun and Fan Bozi. The three acts are divided into morning, dusk, and snowy night. Now, the effect of the lights distinguishes these three time periods.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Serenade in Nostalgia <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>Dusk has arrived;</p>
<p>Little stars shine high,</p>
<p>The light is faint,</p>
<p>The sound is quiet,</p>
<p>As if guarding people to sleep.</p>
<p>Children rest,</p>
<p>Mothers smile;</p>
<p>There are trees by the pond,</p>
<p>Many birds perch,</p>
<p>Dense leaves face the wind,</p>
<p>Low branches cover the dew,</p>
<p>As if people are resting at home,</p>
<p>The door will not open until tomorrow.</p>
