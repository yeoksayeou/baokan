<h3>遠東危機與海軍會議</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>海軍會議將於十二月六日在倫敦舉行。吾人鑒於遠東局面之危急。歐洲和平之無望。於此項會議。雖明知其成功希望至微。然際此國際和平。已無其他出路。而人類命運。漸近最後决定之期。頗認日英美三國之海軍談判。或有助於解决目前問題於萬一。蓋目前問題。乃集體和平之勝利或破產之問題。而除集體和平以外。惟有國際戰爭之一途也。</p>
<p>海軍會議之欲討論者。不外乎諸海軍國之海軍力數量及質量之限制問題。而此問題本身。無討論之可能。英國主張限制主力艦之噸數及砲之口徑。日本主張廢除主力艦及航空母艦等。美國則主張廢除潛艇。此質量方面問題也。英國以國防關係。主張有世界最大之海軍總噸數。日本主張廣除五五三比例。而願與美國平等。美國則主張維持美日五三此率。而與英國維持平等。此數量方面問題也。然數量質量之問題。以何標準而求解决乎。大的噸數。富於侵略性之武器。果何為而存在乎如軍備之原因未廓淸。則徒談裁减軍備。無結果之可言也。</p>
<p>故海軍會議。如不談政治問題。如不解决目前英美日三國在遠東之政治爭執。必無成功之任何希望。曩者哈定總統召集。海軍會議於華盛頓。以九國公約及四國公約。為海軍條約之根據。九國公約維持中國之領土完整及主權獨立。四國公約維持太平洋之現狀。各不侵犯。而不再設海軍根據地。有此二約。諸國始稍獲安全。而肯犧牲其已有軍備之一部分。以為和平努力之表示。今九國公約。已破壞無餘。東四省旣為日本所佔。華北又在動搖之中。在中國方面。日英美勢力均衡。早已動搖。太平洋方面。因日本經濟力政治力及武力之擴充。美國之退出菲列賓及英國之無暇東顧。均勢亦難保持。政治之基礎巳失欲談裁軍。戞乎共難也。</p>
<p>欲海軍會議之順利進行。必自政治之談判始。欲政治談判之有可能。必自日本之改變態度始。如日本在華北之野心。積極發展。而所謂亞洲門羅主義之口號。不肯放棄。則與諸國談裁减軍備。直為與虎謀皮。日本如何可以改變態度耶。曰。此則有賴於外力之推動。所謂外力者何。英美之合作。中國之自覺。蘇聯之積極皆是也。日本當政者已為黷武主義所沈醉。非有外力之壓迫。决不肯稍退一步。三種力量之中。以中國自覺為最要。使吾民族有衛國之决心。呈犧牲之勇氣。則可以博世界之同情。促和平之實現。海軍會議之成敗。遠東和平之能否維持。端在吾四萬萬人民之努力及决心如何耳。</p>

<p>（倫敦）倫敦人士今主張十二月十二日十八人委員會開會時、英國當力促其通過禁油運意之議、惟英國僅將參加集體之决議、而不欲作單獨禁油行動、消息靈通之非政界現咸覺如國聯不能實行對意油禁則必將在美國發生不滿意之反動、因美國對於此項制裁、巳表示贊助之態度也、（二日路透電）</p>
<h3>羅馬尼亞對意禁油　以中立國均能合作為條件</h3>
<p>布楷勒斯　此問今日消息、全世界煤油輸出國以前中立國、如皆能合作對意禁令、則羅馬尼亞始元禁油運意、（一日國民電）</p>
<h3>英國內閣會議　保真意阿和議　認為機述成熟</h3>
<p>（倫敦）國聯旣將禁油運意問題展至下星期討論、故今日下午舉行之英內閣會議、僅將依照常態討論外交事務、衆料閣議並將通過明日正午在上院發表之英皇對新國會訓詞、（二日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）鮑爾溫首相今日召集閣議、以資重行確定英國遵循日定方針、應付意阿戰事、而置墨索里尼之恫嚇於不顧、會議時討論禁油問題及採取海陸空軍事計畫、以防衛英帝國、並悉英帝國之政策雖切心於不曲辱意國之下促進和議、惟如有外交上之讓步、則必須意國為之、內閣將於星期五再開會議、而明日則意內閣亦將舉行重要閣議、據消息靈通方面所知、和議基礎現在未成、居間最出力者仍為法外長賴伐爾、惟聞意方態度巳頗軟化、倫敦方面現認今後兩星期將為歐洲最後緊急關頭、（二日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）聞明日內閣會議、不僅將决定英國對於禁運煤油問題之最後態度及政府訓令、俾付託不管部大臣艾登、以出席十二月十二日之十八國小組委會會議、此外並將討論英法專家在巴黎會同起草之意阿議和計劃、按英國團外部阿比西尼亞問題專家潘德遜與法國外部東菲司長聖岡且最近在巴黎所起草之議和計畫、雖並不能使英國受其約束、然英國政府能否接受此項計畫、目前急須一加研究、如經內閣研究認為叮以接受、則或將在十八國小組委員會通過實行禁運煤油之前、由英法兩國共同向意國政府提出、亦未可知也、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）英法兩國現方草擬解决意阿爭端之建議、關於此事、意國官方人士說明意國準備進行談判、但不將提出任何要求足以妨害英國在阿國之利益、此在英國則雖亦承認該國利益、並未感受威脅、但另一方面、則輒以尊重阿國皇帝主權為託辭、實足妨礙妥協之成立、截至目前為止、墨索里尼與英國大使德魯蒙爵士談判未獲成功職是故也云云、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>對意行施制裁　美國態度堅強　除限制戰具供交戰國　不欵採取更嚴峻計畫</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）國務院對意制裁之態度今日頗為堅强、故美國政府將繼續保持限制運往交戰國家之「主要」物產、不得起過平時數量之政策、官塲方面對於加拿大之聲明、不願批評、惟稱此項行動、不致影響美國之政策、此間觀察者以為哇太華之聲明、不過為說明加拿大之政策、而糾正厲德爾在日內瓦之言論而已、（一日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）傳聞駐美意大使巳向國務院提出抗議、反對美國中立程序所採偏袒國聯之趨向、據紐約美利堅報云意大使會警吿國務院、如擴大限制戰具對意供給之現有舉動、則美國適中英國之計、而使歐洲戰事愈有爆發之可能云、但可恃方面則謂美國除設法勸人勿輕以戰具供給交戰國外、并不擬有何舉動、蓋現行之上立法案不許採行更嚴峻之計畫也、（一日路透電）</p>
<h3>阿比西尼亞　擬在美京設置使館</h3>
<p>開羅　此間阿比西尼亞使館秘書柴菲洛今日宣布、彼奉政府命令、將於十二月七日起程赴美、省府得息羅斯福總統、據悉柴氏此行、或為阿國擬在華盛頓設置使館之先聲、因美國雖在阿皇加冕之時、曾派蘇石特為駐阿公使、現在阿京亦有恩格脫為代辦、然華盛頓迄無阿國使館云、（一日國民電）</p>
<h3>阿政府　向美岱山欵行不由徑實　紐約著名經紀人宣稱　已獲阿國油礦議與權</h3>
<p>（巴黎）紐約著名經紀人却托克、卽前來英倫與阿國駐英公使瑪爾丁博士接洽煤油礦讓與權問題者頃已偕同阿國使館秘書柴費洛與倫敦前往美國、外傳阿國擬向美國借欵一百萬鎊之說、據巴黎迥聲報駐倫敦訪員宣稱、業經正式瞪實、却托克於瀕行時發表談話、謂渠在阿國西南部獲有煤油礦讓與權、其所需之全部資金、係在英國籌措、使美國政府不致出而干涉、一如其前此對於李凱特事件所為云（按李凱特於本年九月間、代表美國美孚煤油公司與阿國政府簽訂煤油礦讓與權、嗣美孚公司接受國務院勸吿後、終於放棄是項讓與權、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>制裁有損國家體面　意精神感痛苦　抵抗運動高唱入雲　限制消費徴募藏金</h3>
<p>（羅馬）聞意國政府現擬繼續進行談判、以謀解决意阿爭端、但以保全有關意國生存之利益及榮譽為其先决條件、至於國聯會實行禁運煤油後、究將引起何種反應、則意國政府方面以為此際尙難定、但謂禁運煤油一舉、在意國將視為損國家體面、蓋至目前為止、實施制裁所予意國之痛苦、在精神方面實較甚於經濟方面也、自國聯會實施制裁後、意國人</p>

<h3>英帝國新聞機關　倫敦建九層巨廈　規模宏大設備完美　路透興英聯社密切合作　世界新聞交換開新時代</h3>
<p>倫敦通訊、倫敦佛里街現將起築大厦一所、供路透通訊社及英國新聞聯合社之用、凡與路透社有關之英帝國與外國通信機關、及與聯合社有直接接觸之報館機關、亦皆附入、此為世界前所未有規模最宏設備最完之新聞交換塲所、新屋圖樣由魯顏爵士規畫之、</p>
<p>查十二年前倫敦路透社以事業擴張、非其原有之百年舊屋所能容、故將總管理部及國際新聞部移至白拉克佛萊附近之新屋、當時頗覺地位寬暢、儘有擴張餘地、但不及數年、事業日增、覺新舊社址又不足以應其需要、於是有另築新厦之議、不獨兩處社務歸併一處、且將其英帝國與外國通訊機關亦隸入焉、</p>
<p>同時英國新聞聯合社亦戚同樣困難、其所置之擺倫厦近已過嫌擁擠、不敷應用、不得不遷地為良、聯合社產生於七十年前、最初卽向路透社採用英帝國與外國新聞、故雙方關係密切、由來已久、後乃愈臻親密、雙方主持者皆以積極合作為政策、而不碍其各自活動之範圍、亦不失其各樹一幟之本性、蓋路透社為英帝國與外國新聞機關、而聯合社則為採訪國內新聞之負責總機關也、</p>
<p>雙方携手共同應付館舍難題、自屬天然結果、於是設法購置擺倫厦後面之地基、俾與擺倫厦連成一片、自佛里街而達沙利斯堡路、同時聘建築師魯顏爵士設計繪圖、新地之購置與圖樣之繕擬、費時幾及一載、今則擺倫厦及其隣屋行將拆除矣、</p>
<p>新屋九層、四面臨街、正門設於佛里街、內部將置有收發新聞之最新式雷機、及其他裝置、而研究多時之若干發明工具、亦將備置、路透社與新聞聯合社在新屋內將以最密切之合作共同經營交換消息、庶聯合社對於英國各報館、路透社對於英帝國歐陸遠東與世界他處、皆可以量高之效率為之服務焉、</p>
<p>英國海外通信機關及外國通信機關凡與路透社有關者、其駐倫敦之辦事員皆將設事務所於此新建之大厦內、而路透社與聯合社在每日四十八小時中所接源源不絕之國內外消息、可隨時立卽分送各事務所、庶各地消息傳遞神速轉瞬遍及世界而無延擱、</p>
<p>總之、新屋吿成後、制度一新、工作方法與前不同、世界新聞合作交換之新時代將從此開始矣、（路透社）</p>

<h3>明月投懷（下）</h3>
<p>— 張鈺哲</p>
<p>從此看來地球的確是月兒的母親了。眼前遠處天涯，恐怕也難免離別之感。一旦明月下墜可算是游子歸家，當可稍慰倚閭之望。尤其是月兒在衆衛星間，肥胖出衆。太陽若能含飴弄孫，月兒必定是最得寵的一個了。太陽最大的兒子木星少爺，重量還不到他母親的千分之一。木星有九子繞膝，其最大兒子的重量也只有木星萬分之一的光景。士星那一房裏的大兒子，只有十星重量四千分之一。但是我們這個月兒的重量，可有地球八十分之一那麽重，自然可以算做一位出類拔萃的孫兒。因為月兒有這特別肥胖的體格，我們懷疑當他生產下來時候所受的手術，和其他各衛星稍為有點不同。根據那創說進化論之達爾文的文孫意見，月亮的產生是在地球尙未凝固自轉非常迅疾的時侯，再加上太陽生潮作用，便從地球本體分裂出來。當時地球還是流質所以會被太陽激起一道壁立千仞的高峯。等到高峯中斷的時候，他的上端便凝成月亮，和地球相距已經很遠。可是和現在月地的距離比起來，才只有二十四分之一。</p>
<p>那麽月兒為什麽要離開地球，越跑越遠呢，難道是遊蕩成性。追究起來，海洋裏的潮汐不能不尸其咎。地球是要轉動的，而潮汐總在那裏橫加障礙。當年地球只要四小時便能轉了一週，那是何等的靈捷。現在自轉一次便非二十四小時不可。但消長倚伏自然界也不免這種現象。地球自轉弛緩下來，太陰繞地的行動，便越跑越起勁。地球對於月兒的管束，也只得逐步放鬆任他遠去。不過到了地球自轉一週的時問，延長到和太陰繞地一周的時問相等的當兒，便要否極泰來有新的轉機了。那時候地球上只有一邊能够舉杯邀明月，另一邊的人民將要連太陰都不認得。現在還不曉得這抱明月以長終的幸運，將要落到那一個半球手裏。細想這幸運雖非空頭支票，將來不免也要大打折扣。因為月亮旣是越跑越遠，那時的淸輝必定是遠不如今的。</p>
<p>據說那時一畫夜和一朔望的期間，大約都等於現在的四十七天。從此之後潮汐的行徑，要完全痛改前非。他再也不拖累地球而且要帮助推着地球，使旋轉加快。再按照着盈虛倚伏之理（用科學的土話說，便稱作角動量之不變），月亮跑圈的速度，便逐漸鬆懈。於是這久羈天涯的遊子，就不得不漸漸地投向慈母懷中來了。從月兒那方看來，這舉動總可算是孝思的表現。提倡忠孝仁愛信義和平的人們，自應加以鼓勵。不過這個等於數千百座崇山的石球，從半空落下，世上人們不被壓死，也被震死。恐怕就是道德家也難被饒下，去向月兒傳達人們嘉許的意思。</p>
<p>生怕有人實備我以關謠始以造謠終，我在此趕緊聲明一句，當月亮决要落到地上來的時光，必定有個救星出現，把人類這塲大刦數，一筆勾消。但是事難兩全，這救星雖是人類之福，而月亮便不免遭殃了。因為地球對於月亮也同樣地有生潮的力量。地球憑藉着他那較為魁梧的體魄，當月亮和他過於靠近的時候，地球的力量能把月亮逐步撕碎，使他化成無數小月亮，圍繞地球飛奔，而不再衝撞下來。大家若是不信這個說法，請你抬頭望一望十星。他和木星一樣地有福氣？也有九個衛星繞着。可是最靠近士星身旁的，便非月亮而是幾層極為美觀的光環（凡胎肉眼需要望遠鏡才可看見）。這光環非他，便是粉身碎骨的衛星的榜樣。我們月兒如果聽明，應當知道引以為前車之鑒。依據數學的估計，月兒呱呱墜地約在四十萬萬年前。但是從現在直到明月重行回到地球懷裏，所要經過的年代，還不止這區區四十萬萬年的一剎那。我們若想欣賞這將來衆月蔽天的偉觀，那就不能不步武秦皇，去追尋那不死之方了。</p>

<h3>歌史豔冬重登歌台　喘疾旣愈貌益豔麗　鶯喉乍囀餘音繞樑</h3>
<p>距滬不遠之某市三餘社羣芳會唱。共有歌史十餘名。就中以艷冬為台柱。因其貌旣姣好。唱工尤佳。孰料艷冬日前起居不愼。致為風寒所侵。始則喉部發炎。繼而咳嗽微作。終則成為喘病。以是不能登臺淸唱。該社平日顧客大失所望。相率不赴該社聽歌。於是營業一落千丈。嗣艷冬就醫滬上。醫囑其服用華商新華行經理之英國新發明治喘聖藥「醫肺星」藥片。果然效騐神速。大有藥到喘止之妙。近日咳嗽完全不作。喉音可稱完全復原。玉容更顯艷麗。三餘社主人聞之。乃請其重復奏曲。艷冬因於前日重行登台。照常淸唱。鶯喉乍轉。餘音繞樑。聽衆報以熱烈掌聲至三分鍊之久。艷冬受此激厲。更為唱得起勁。此數日來。該社顧客擁擠幾無隙地可容云。</p>

<p>捷克斯拉夫台維斯杯代表孟瑞爾海許二人、此次在日本表演、歸返歐洲、昨日過滬、搭日輪淸國丸抵此、本埠中國網球會特請孟海二人出塲表演、由卡遜德孚二人伴賽、表演單雙打各一塲、中西網球迷慕名往觀者甚衆、約到一千餘人、其中以西人為多、天時寒冷、能有此盛況、足見其號召力矣、單雙打俱為捷選手所勝、精彩之處、掌聲不絕、孟氏今晨離滬赴香港、或將赴印度一游云、</p>
<p>球藝</p>
<p>孟氏為全世界草地綱球男子單打第七名選手、去年惠勃爾登、到達單打最後八人、昨日表演、妙技迭出、不愧名手、其以直落三勝卡遜、尙未盡展其長、最惹人注意者、為出手敏速非凡、高壓厲害、勝許承基多多、其反手之準確、神妙無匹、大率皆以反手得勝、正手反見平平、時見上網、網前之斜射與半空球、亦為其特長、未遜之表演、亦有不少妙射、惜乎名手當前、膽量太小、其後發現孟之弱點、曾屢攻孟之正手、得分不少、海許年事尙輕、球術純熟、雖無特殊之點、各式俱能、純熟非凡、前途可造、二人之雙打、似不及單打之佳、合作功夫、尙未臻佳境、第一盤卡德大有機會得勝、惜乎德孚錯誤勾多、重要關頭、常常失誤、故精彩反不多、</p>
<p>自右至左德孚卡遜海許孟瑞爾　（朱順麟攝）</p>
<p>單打</p>
<p>單打為孟瑞爾對卡遜孟瑞爾首先發球、峻急異常、左攔右抽、卡遜應付乏術、被其净勝一局卡努力振作、利用底綫長抽、孟稍一疏忽、遂成各一、壯後孟一帆風順、遙遙遠抽、球均深入邊綫、時而上前攔網、或輕或斜或壓或挑、卡雖有佳妙演出、但終難得逞、兼之自誤又多、遂以一比六終第一盤、孟乘戰勝餘威、秉其純熟球藝、運用球拍、劈削有勁、連獲三局、至第四局時卡遜施展所長、經過數度平手、獲勝、孟發球雖急、但欠準確、高球壓殺、却有獨到之處、卡賴其長抽、乘孟呈現軟弱疲憊之時、又獲兩局、但終以技藝不敵、孟又以六比三勝二盤、第三盤卡先發球、卡努力應戰、迭有佳作、獲第二局後競爭劇烈、但實力懸殊、終以六比一敗績、</p>

<p>第七屆公展杯國際手球賽、昨日舉行第二循環、共賽五塲、中華隊以三對二勝、倘今日之單打仍能佔優、則雙打賽可不成問題、而獲得本屆錦標、</p>
<p>朱球王力雪前恥　朱寬之手球與李惠堂之足球、均有球王之稱、第一循環中不幸被於却克力、實因抱病登塲、有以致之、昨日巳恢復健康、故以二對一克服却克力、而言前日之恥、開賽後即處佔優、而其角球又為却克力之致命傷、劈擊壓殺、尤俱神效、第二局雖為却克力所得、然結果終歸朱寬獲勝、</p>
<p>孫家祿不幸敗北　中華隊孫家綠出戰第三單打、孫之體格極佳、擊球亦好、於第一循環中對馮斯、極為裕如、昨戰禮納於第一局中、曁勢甚大、以廿一對十四獲勝、第二局以二分之差見敗、甚屬可惜、在緊要關頭之第三局竟一蹶不振、左各手之並用亦不能致禮納於死地、結果以二對〇敗北、</p>
<p>丁炳耀一籌莫展　西人隊之薄利利斯、擊球佳妙、且機巧過人、丁炳耀眞不堪為之一擊、全在薄氏之控制之下、一籌莫展、難得分數、偶有一二球之獲得、亦無補於大局、〇對二大敗、</p>
<p>嚴培秋奮勇異常　嚴培秋曾為牛皮糖之斯密士所敗、然昨日對來金之賽却頓改舊觀、奮勇異常且擊殺亦頗適當、斯密士完全在其掌握之中、故勝來毫不費力、</p>
<p>來金為寳琦所困　第九單打孫寳琦出塲作戰、來金全為所困、四對廿一、十五對廿一、完全失敗、孫風雲叱咤、勇猛非凡、前次之敗、實屬不幸之故、非戰之罪也、茲將昨賽各局成續及今日秩序分誌於下、</p>

<p>兒童敎育小説</p>
<h3>小男兒</h3>
<p>— Louisa　M．Alcott原著鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>這使羅勃深信不疑，於是南恩就領導他度淺灘，越危石，他也就盲目跟從，經過了許多迂週曲折，才領他到大盤石的一個小洞，這裏薰焦的石頭，分明見得有人曾在此處舉過火的。</p>
<p>「呀，這不是有趣嗎？」南恩問道，隨手從她的袋裏取一點拌着油的麵包，可是巳不像個機子，因為已與釘子，魚鈞，石頭和其他雜物夾拌了。</p>
<p>「是的，但是你想他們不就會找到我們的嗎？羅勃問道，他覺得那幽僻的山坳實是無聊，開始想着他其餘的同伴了。</p>
<p>「不，我不：因為我如果聽見他們來了，我要藏過，看他們怎樣找我才有趣呢，」</p>
<p>「他們也許不再來了。」</p>
<p>「我不管；我自已能够回去，」</p>
<p>「這不是很遠嗎？」羅勃問道，相着他的一雙小小粗矮的靴子，經過了長途的跋涉，巳是渴透而且布滿了抓破的痕跡。</p>
<p>「我想大概有六英里。」南恩對於距離的觀念甚糢糊，而她對於自己的能力却又自信很堅的。</p>
<p>一我想我們還是現在回去罷」羅勃不久又出這個主意道，</p>
<p>「我還不去，我再要揀黑莓哩；」說後南恩就開始去揀，羅勃等得眞是不耐煩了。</p>
<p>忽然太陽落在山背後去了，他嘆息道，「呀，你說過要好好照顧我的。」</p>
<p>「我是在照顧你，而且盡我的心力呢。不要煩躁，小孩子；我一會兒也就去了，」南恩說着，她以為一個六歲的羅勃和她相比，不過是個嬰兒罷了。</p>
<p>於是小羅勃儘自坐着，環顧四周中心惴惴，可是還忍耐等着，因為他雖然頗懷疑懼，然而對於南恩覺得是很可信托的。</p>
<p>「我想不長久就要夜了，」他彷彿自言自語道，其時一個蚊子巳咬了他一口，而隣近池塘裏的亂蛙，却巳開始在吹起那黃昏的合奏曲了。</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （周瘦鵑）</p>
<p>從前越國被吳國所滅，越王勾踐和他的王后也做了俘虜。吳王夫差要他匍匐稱臣，就鋪匐稱臣，把他幽禁石室，就幽禁石室；甚至逼他嘗　就嘗　，喚他養馬就養馬，低首下心的受盡了種種的屈辱，眞可說是極大的忍耐了。可是他後來仗著伯嚭之助，被釋回國，便茹苦含辛，臥薪嘗膽，十年生聚十年敎養的埋頭苦幹；又加上了范蠡西施爲著祖國，抱定犧牲的决心，終於報仇雪恥，把吳國滅了。這一箇古老的故事，正是我們一箇很好的敎訓，很好的榜樣，大家都應當記在心上，把越王勾踐當做偶像般膜拜信奉的。最近在蘇州看了上海劇院所表演的「西施」，使我興奮得了不得，表演者如程靜子女士的西施，徐麗琳女士的鄭旦，呂平君的夫差，范寅甫君的勾踐，錢風君的范蠡，邢錦湖君的伍子胥，白雄飛君的伯嚭，都十二分的努力，使我們得了一箇極深刻的印象，這更不得不佩服陳大悲顧文宗二君的編導之功了。蘇州演罷之後，聽說他們還須到無錫常熟去表演，這眞是功德無量的事。可愛的藝人們哪！我敬以一瓣、心香，祝你們爲國珍重，走萬里，演萬遍，好喚醒那些醉生夢死的國人，旣做過了前半部的勾踐，可不要忘了做後半部的勾踐啊！</p>

<p>故鄉有個種田大戶，由一老翁統率了五個年富力强的兒子和雇來的三個長工，其耕種一百數十畝田。一家男女老幼力作，更加異乎尋常的省吃省用，所以年年大有積蓄，雖然表面上誰也看不出他們如有錢人，可是遠近數十里，誰也料他們是個巨富，老翁生平不愛鈔票，祗是愛着白白的銀子，他又不信任銀行，所以都一一埋藏在家裏，而秘密得連五個媳婦也不知道究藏何處。三年之前的某一個月白風高之夜，數十暴客，武裝撞入這大戶人家，一家人都得逃避，惟有老翁不幸被執，衆盜逼翁說出藏銀之所，翁那裏肯把一家人的血汗拱手讓人呢？堅說沒有。盜便施刑，由束縛敲打，以至水灌其頂，火炙其下體，他所抵死不說，這時他的兩媳逃伏於前面的屋脊上，遙見後面屋中阿翁被刑之慘，不覺脫口高呼，勸他趕速供出藏銀。一再高呼，翁也覺得不能忍了，方始吐露出來。原來他家大天井中，有一用磚築成的台，台上置一大缸自製醬汕。移缸毀台，裏面盡是堆着現銀。衆盜於是取了麻布袋，把它裝起來，抬槓了而去。事後據翁告訴人，損失約一萬多塊錢哩</p>
<p>山西人藏銀之風更甚，有一人家在家中秘密處築一地窖，把所有的現洋，燒熔成了銀漿傾入。固結之後，變成了一大銀塊，更便保存而不愁被刦了。某年不幸爲變兵知道這秘密，乃蜂湧而去，打開了地窖。可是眼看着白白的銀子，而改有方法取到手。敲了一陣，依然空手而去。</p>
<h3>有人跳水</h3>
<p>— 水冗</p>
<p>那的人已被救起來了，這時　　　在一把椅子上嘔吐。我們不知道他還吐出一些什麽別的東西來，除了水之外。這兒是多麽黑暗！今晚沒有月亮。那從白燈射來的光又給看客們遮住了。一個巡捕揮着手喊：「跑開，跑開呀！」沒有人聽他。那站在後面的拼命往前擠。</p>
<p>有人在擦洋火了。大家立刻伸長勃子，想看看那消極的人是個怎樣的人。在短命的火焰下，我祇獲得一個輸廓：黑色的布掛，黑色的紗襪，黑色的舊運動鞋。他的體格和打扮使我相信他是二十歲左右。「那麼年靑呵！」我不禁叫了出來。</p>
<p>幾個美國人凭着欄杆，在議論救命圈的位置相距太遠的事。一個問我：「他可有朋友在這兒？」我回答他說：「沒有」。</p>
<p>恐怖的沉默統治着空間。那厭世者已不作聲了。我害怕有什麽不好的事將發生。秋風在梧桐上嗚咽着。</p>
<p>終於救護隊來了，一陣騷亂。瞧着他們把那垂死的人放在那舁牀上，扛出園子去；看客們有說有笑的散了。</p>
<p>我獨個兒站在這個地方，望望地上那堆物事，再望望茫茫的黑油油的黃浦，感覺莫名的悲哀。爲什麼一個人企圖毀滅自己的生命？每個人不有他的生的欲望嗎？而且他是那麽年靑，我瞧他的樣子不像是爲了失戀，那最可能的原因該是受着經濟壓迫了。假使眞是如此，我—我們不是有一部分責任嗎？人類的進步是每個人生活的向上，自殺的發生不是我們人類的恥辱是什麽？想起那些看客們的說笑的態度，我又該作怎麼解釋呢？</p>
<p>讓我爲那個不幸的人祈禱吧！</p>
<p>文藝消息：近年來國人對於摩登歌曲，漸感興趣，歌曲書之銷數，亦日盛一日，最近美術書店出版之「憶秋歌曲集」，係前中華歌專敎授殷憶秋君之新作，如「浪花」「新小放牛」「勞工神聖」等新曲二十餘，以及過去新作之「國花」「愛情是什麼」「我不能忘記你」等共三十四曲，均經殷君親自校對三次以上，故已絲毫無訛，聞現已出版，由四馬路中慶記書局發行，本外埠各書局均有出售云。</p>
<h3>民間素描</h3>
<p>— 涓隱</p>
<p>酒幾斤，莫幾盆，高談濶論，一事無成！</p>
<h3>三國演義</h3>
<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>說部枝談</p>
<p>三國演義這部小說，在中國眞可算得家弦戶誦的了。要是說看過紅樓夢的男子想學做賈賣玉女子想學做林黛玉，那末，我敢武斷的說一句：看過三國演義的定在想學做諸葛孔明！</p>
<p>因爲三國演義的讀者都同情蜀漢，希望劉玄德能够「重整山河」！而孔明又是蜀漢的柱石，他們的目光就很自然的注重於他個人！因此有人說三國演義看到五丈原孔明歸天的一回，就不忍再看下去！就是看下去也徒然加重悲歎！人心的向背眞是够玄妙的哪！</p>
<p>其實，看到五丈原孔明歸天就廢卷輟讀的人們，還算是有耐性的！要是我，呂子明白衣渡江之後，三國演養的下文是可以不必讀的了！因爲自荊州失而蜀漢椅角之勢絕，縱有孔明之才，僅能廻旋祁山左右，終成偏安之局，而卒不免於覆亡！這是「漢賊不兩立」的事實證明。</p>
<p>這些都是孔明早就料到的！看他隆中决策，那篇文字，他明確地斷定天下是個三分之局，然而他仍是跟着劉玄德拚命的想討賊！想興復漢室！鞠躬盡瘁！死而後巳！孔明之所以能萬古留名，不在他的功業，不在他的才智，而在他痴到極度忠到極度的心腸，這是現在我們許多不長進的後輩所應痛自淬勵的！」</p>
<p>讓我再向諸位複述孔明的幾句名言吧！在隆中决策時他曾對劉玄德說「北讓曹操得天時，東讓孫權得地利，將軍可取西川佔入和。」可見劉阿斗所以能在四川做四十多年昏庸皇帝，全憑「人和」的力量！假使一個國家旣失天時！復失地利！又失人和！我要請問諸位，它憑什麼力量可以生存在這個弱肉强食的世界！</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第二十一回　婉轉依人過庭憐月貌激昂訓壻隔室聽獅聲</p>
<p>那婦人讓道：我偏要管，姓賈的若是是虐待了他，金融學　要和他打官司。好在這小西天裏面，住了有一位專查人間善惡的專員，要告狀在本飯店裏告他就行。那局長道：喂，這位嫂子，你不必在這裏打攪，你去罷。隨了這句話以後，就見那位胡嫂子，手扶了墻壁，由窗子面前經過，低了頭是慢慢的走着的。可是那個穿西裝的女人，立刻跑得高跟皮鞋，得得的嚮，順手一把，將胡嫂子拉住。這時，可以看淸他的臉了，像石灰一樣的，敷了一層厚粉。可是在那厚粉之中，凹凸不平的，佈滿了的紫色疙疸。兩道眉毛都箝乾凈了，却還剩了兩道粗的肉痕，在肉痕上再畫了一道墨綫，兩隻胡桃大眼，右眼皮上，還有一個蘿蔔花兒。鼻子倒是很高，可是鼻子下面，兩個大厚嘴唇皮，向外翻了出來，由那翻嘴唇裏，露出兩排亂七八糟的牙齒來。他道：你怕什麽？我不叫你走，什麽人也不敢叫你走。你以爲他是一個老爺嗎？那算不得什麽。假使他沒有我，他那老爺也做不成的。你只管跟我進來說話。那胡嫂子是有名的小脚，如何受得了他這樣有力的拉扯？所以顚倒着身禮，就趣他到屋子裏去了。北海聽到那太太問胡嫂子的話時，本來臀反，繃得很緊的，及至胡嫂子跑了出來，倒不由得洩了一口氣。臀上自然也帶了幾分失望的樣子。這時胡嫂子又進去了，他把那沮喪了的臉色，重新又振作起來，這就向志前笑道：這樣子，他倒是可以想一點法子的。（三七〇）</p>
<p>拉雜話</p>
<h3>空院坐雨</h3>
<p>— 羅甸</p>
<p>心情正像幽　的雨天，即使有一鱗藍雲，不久被風吹散，化爲蒼茫的淡姻，滿全身，給層層的淡烟包圍，瞧不見太陽的微笑，聽不到人間的呼吸，因爲老大的空院落裏，只剩下了我一個。如果說蘆簾下的畫眉，不時也唱出媚人的新歌，但這近於譏笑的聲音，益加形容出中午的寂靜，我有些兒不敢聽到。眞的，再沒有比海岸上偶而撥動莎草那種暗澹的希噓，更感孤獨了的。這環境，我也懂得，最好就坐近窗前，斟一盃苦茶，看水蒸從茶葉片上騰起，慢慢消逝，不必研究物理的壓力，也不須找覓雅馴的詩句，更不可思憶過去或瞻卜前途；也許暫時會忘掉自己，而滲進了更神奇更深沉的夢裏，因此得到幸福。然而，我雖孤獨，我又寂寞，我感到了凄凉，怎知有人正爲了我的無力，在這大衆假期裏，還要跑到很遠很遠的滬西敎書去呢！難道要在陰沈的初冬，風已生了芒角，雨正發瘋地下着，忍心呌伊離開家？離開我？伊又忍心離開家和我？悠悠地想吧：奔走在雨街上的人。尚且不曾憎恨過伊所担負下來的過分忙碌的功課，而倒坐在家裏不做半些事情，敢訴御孤獨？寂寞？即使當眞厭悶，也只配活受！能嚼半個字？得驚醒自己的良知，一個年輕的　孩子正在這時候替我找覓着糧食！伊難道不懂得「影子的悲哀」？而伊并沒有半句廣州語！</p>
<p>於是我微笑，幸福的雨花，洒滿了我的前額。帶着一朶比本香更輕匠心靈，漸漸踱向院落裏去，院落的白石上，全跳着珍珠的閃光，使我呼到一口爽利的甜風，四肢與雙眼，就覺舒服和明朗。一種淸爽的冷氣，跟着兩顆，打上頭髮，飛進皮膚，深入心扉，尤其感到精神健發，意興亢奮，恰如剛從苦獄中脫逃出來的眼珠，被金色的太陽射中了一箭似的。</p>
<p>凡是憎恨自已或別人，就因爲不肯寬恕所致。沒有一件事情，當你能够退一步想時，不可以解决。甚且世界可以沒有戰爭。但不管所謂聖賢或流氓，極少興趣來考慮「寬恕」，所以鬥爭的血，永遠諷刺着文明的甲胄，人與人間，不見「眞愛」露臉！</p>
<p>多謝這一塲淸新的冬雨，啟示我以不平凡的智慧，我便拉一個籐椅，靠荷花缸邊坐下，讓一天靈雨，灌漑着愚昧人的腦袋。</p>
<p>荷花，誰都聽到了，會想起六月的香風。在這木葉亂飛的季節，好像不必提及。但就爲了這緣故，我更願注意到它。還記得，初搬來時，這院落裏開滿了荷花，每個花缸的泥水之間，有着小金魚游來游去，掩映於翠莖紅花中，非常好看。每逢天雨，荷葉上瀉出雨珠，滴下缸去，小金魚張開嘴唇，本能地一嚥，就把尾巴一撥，很玲瓏的游遠了。這美妙的印象，實在不容易使我忘記。但現在，藕早磨成了粉，給人當作食料；荷梗被折斷，送向藥材店去；那裏還有什麽花？就連那些精緻的金魚，也漸漸夭殤，所剩無幾。而且所剩的幾尾，又因爲忍不住寒凍，巳搬進書齊的白磁碗裏，作爲文牕點綴品，當然吸收不到天然的泉露，好像現出了衰頹的神情，怕再過幾天，那運命要它生存到過年，就很難料吧？花，魚，在這雨天，不能不呌我愴傷起自己來！而况乾涸了的荷花缸，漸漸地承着淸水，正反映出一副消瘦的面容？</p>

<h3>糧食　實銷帮不動　麪粉出入甚少</h3>
<p>昨日粉市呈初疲繼穩之態、上午初開因洋麥報價、芝加哥跌三四分、坎拿大跌四五角不等、並以北方時局混亂、人心不免虛弱、故各月份開價、曾較前月底收價、小去二分外、惟至二盤後疲勢巳定、且以廠方不出、業外多頭、利用洋麥難定之說、依然吸收、故市面又回漲一分外、迨至下午開盤、交易初尙見暢、後因實銷帮不動、出入甚少、價亦盤旋、最後結果、較前月底收價、計好二釐半至一分、五月份暫停開拍、因靑黃不接、麥底空虛、洋麥又不能確定、交易所爲减免危險起見、暫時不拍云、</p>

<h3>期麥竟盤盤空拍</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤、交易淸淡異常、多數月份、均盤盤空拍、半因國歷年關巳近、業中人均預備結束、半因北方時局明寬暗緊雖未臨頭、人心未免不安、不過洋麥報價國內存底依然步稀、是以人心反覺轉佳耳月份較前月收價、計好三五分、現麥市况、見交尙暢、價趨平穩、開山東明光頴州蚌埠沙河集麥五元另六分、丹陽麥五元、計四千包由福新辦去云、</p>

<h3>客秈本街銷路稍活　客囤忽又停頓</h3>
<p>昨日客秈到頭甚旺、湘贛漢沙皖閩浙各省均有到埠、存貨亦足、而囤戶在前昨略爲試辦後旋即停手、北帮連日採辦河下杜粳、乃無意於客秈、因此形勢甚軟、繼有本街趁此平檔收買、市面仍可站足、全日辦去贛米二千五百多包、湘米二百包、沙漢五百包、南陵二百包、甬江溫台各米二千一百多包、南京秈八百五十包、閩米二百五十包、行情均與前市相似、惟洋米貨乏、價好三分、售開西貢一號一百包、價十一元零三分、由本街辦去、</p>
<h3>薄稻北銷不斷</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源四十餘號、（貨共八千餘石）本街銷塲似稍活絡、包胃續有天津·靑島·威海衛等帮辦四千餘包、故薄稻市色略見轉緊、行情回起六七分、而厚早等粳則尙難提升、杜洋尖無榮辱、陰變元高者秀而中市平、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源頗旺、約有八十餘號、市上白粳去路依然平常、市價小一二角、薄稻到頭續有、零化呆滯、價短角外、，羊埠尖到銷兩和、價亦定局、杜尖貨稀挺立、客尖平定、其餘各貨略呈軟勢、</p>
<h3>糖市　粵糖標售原價未成</h3>
<p>昨日糖市以實銷淸寂、無甚變動、公果劃盤二四粗砂白、現貨二十一元八角、轉口貨六元九角、均少受手、本廠綿白振記一號二十元八角、二號五角、三號一角、四號十九元九角、五號七角、糖業合作公司五牟粵粗白、標價二十一元八角、轉口荷粗白六元九角、二號五羊綿白二十一元〇五分、四號二十元八角半、因行方無進意、臻未成交、其他號貨亦僅呌價而巳、市象至覺疲弱、</p>
<h3>南北貨　川榨菜再升五六角</h3>
<p>四川榨菜近來到貨仍少、行方續有吸收、曾以十三四元至十二元半、比升五六角、成交千餘　、查客貨存底亦祇千數件、故趨勢至爲堅挺、有再緊象、</p>
<h3>絲茶　路莊綠茶歡銷轉暢</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊茶市、婺源屯溪等路之珍眉針眉等綠茶、歐銷轉暢、英莊怡和洋行、因摩洛哥來電訂購、頗有鉅量進胃、永興同孚等行、亦均有零星補進、全市成交一千五百餘箱、珍眉價開五十元、針眉售價自二十元至三十二元、較前見跌三四元、查現市活動原因、實係茶價减低所致云、</p>

<h3>旅業公會劃一房價</h3>
<p>— 子南</p>
<p>月是在上海有五年以上的歷史的，我想，對於上海旅館業的興起，一定能够知道一些。我們試到西藏路去瞧一下，滿目在望的，差不多儘是些旅館，這些旅館，在五年前是並沒這麽多，有之，也决沒有像現在那樣的堂皇富麗。</p>
<p>而在四五年前的深夜，我們要是從西藏路經過，它所給我們的印象是什麽呢？籠統一點說來，是「城開不夜」四個字。憑你是深夜二三點鐘了，猜拳聲，骨牌聲，絃索中夾雜着的女人的歌聲，還是滿街飛揚；每個窗子裏，總是燈光雪亮的。</p>
<p>（上海的旅館是並不給「旅客」住的，旅館祗是給上海人作爲消遣娛樂的營寨，而所謂娛樂消遣，又總是姻酒嫖賭這一套。）</p>
<p>現在呢，在晚上十二點鐘經過那兒，你便可以顯著的感到，四五年前每個窗子裏的雪亮的燈光，現在是難得見到了。雖然，門口的燈光依舊，甚至是加甚，但這並不足以顯示豪華，那些燈光裏，大槪是都包含着「買一天住一天」或照碼×折的。</p>
<p>不景氣的浪潮襲來之後，最先露形的是農村；上海因爲是所謂經濟中心，商業中心，以及文化，政治中心的緣故，在不景氣的浪潮最先襲到的時候，一時還顯現出充血的景象，這充血的景象，不久之後因爲別部份的貧血症日益加深，所以充血便成了浮腫，表面上雖好像依舊如此，而實際上，可和農村並不有什麽上下。</p>
<p>而最近，這症象便無法隱瞞的暴露了出來。漸漸地，這不景氣的狂風，也由別種事業而進展到旅館業。</p>
<p>在世紀未的年代裏，小有產及有產者的放浪形骸，原是特徵之一，他們眼看到自己這一羣的沒落，掙扎無從，於是便一歲而已享樂主義者，瘋狂地去迫求物質上的精神上的享受，刺激，而作爲姻酒嫖賭的營寨的旅館，便成爲最好的去處。</p>
<p>可是，近年來，因爲經濟恐慌的日益加深，小有產者已有力不從心之苦。於是，大飯店便不得不用「買一送一」及照碼×折」來作爲號召。</p>
<p>更因爲這種「買一送一」或買一送二」及「照碼×折」的辦法，擾亂了同業間的房價，於是，旅館業同業公會便有「劃一同業房價」及「折扣實施」的六條辦法。</p>
<p>不過，房價的劃一，是否由同業公會的議决案而平定呢？這是很難樂觀的。「實行照碼八折後不得以贈品等類似方法作變相之破壞標準折扣一，雖可由同業公會的議决案來制止，但又何以能保證各個同業的削低原價？再說，卽使房價規定，由　業公會一按照成本之多寡議定平衡價目」，但　於營業上，是否就能保證有起色？</p>
<p>不然，於根本問題旣未解决，僅僅做到「勰一房價」又有何用？</p>
<p>而所謂根本問題，又是隨社會組織而來的。</p>
<h3>冬小景</h3>
<p>— 貝華</p>
<p>夜是那麽長……</p>
<p>江面上是靜寂的。水面泛起銀灰色的光，盪漾着，發出微弱的聲息。船隻停在江心像一幢怪物，遮着半邊月亮的是那黑姻囱，拖下一大朶陰影。江海關前的馬路除了偶然駐過一輛或者兩輛汽車之外，也不太發現生物的影子了，對着大自鳴鐘，值崗的巡捕噓着氣。</p>
<p>在霧似的氣里，他那惺忪的眼睛恍惚看到一些什麽——是的，他看到家裏的妻睜着一雙多情的龍眼核一般的眼珠子躺在床上，等候着他的歸來。還有兒子的小臉蛋，那麽溫甜地入了夢。他是有一個溫和的家的哪，然而他却站在這裏，面着凜冽的江風。</p>
<p>風帶着浦東田野的私語吹過和平之神的肩胛，在風的呼哨中，他終於淸醒過來了。抬起頭望一下時間：大自鳴鐘正打着三點半。</p>
<p>噹地一聲兒嘈醒了在貨棧角落裏打磕睡的流浪兒，揩揩眼睛，覺得很冷，不知怎麽再也睡不去啦。用于推了一下旁邊的小六子，這傢伙却死了半截似地不醒轉來。這時候，他的銳利的感覺告訴他有誰來了——脚步聲愈近愈淸楚。於是他就出力打了小六子一記耳光！「巡捕來啦！」那麽拉着小六子就往外迷。</p>
<p>世界雖然大，然而沒有他們安息的地方。在公園外的慘白的燈光下，這兩個小靈魂有一對蒼黑的臉。飢寒使他們發抖。破舊而又單薄的衣衫怎能抵得住這十一月末的夜寒呢？</p>
<p>這正是一些享樂的人們和被人享藥的人們坐着車子回家去安息的時侯。我們到那邊橋頭去弄幾個子兒明天買大餅吧！」小六子說。他們得到在橋頭拉黃包車的機會是很費了一段苦鬥的；現在，這成了他們唯一的生路。一面走一面望着蘇州河發黑的水，小小的心凝成一塊冰那麽冷了。</p>
<p>在橋的這一邊，等着車子拉到那一邊，從夜行人的手中得到一個或者兩個銅子，就收於在半破的衣袋裏。沒有誰給他們予同情，在誰都缺乏一顆同情心的現在。從夜總會中冒着夜寒走出來，坐在車上鬆一鬆被摟得酸軟了的身子，那年靑的舞女憐惜自己還來不及，她能給小六子什麽呢？喝醉了的水兵把帽子弄得斜下來，遮去了一隻眼睛，莫明其妙地哈哈大笑着，小六子只好躱在一邊，爲那在一雙皮靴之下掙扎着的車夫難過。一個面貌奇醜，始終拉不到客的妓女在橋上楞着，望望天，又望望河水，好像找不到一個去處似地，無論是天堂或者地獄…</p>
<p>夜是那麽長；像永遠不會有黎明的樣子，寒氣更加地重了。</p>
<p>人家瓦上的霜不到明朝太陽出來的時候是不會融散的。觀綫桿和街燈陪伴着都會的寂寞。遠遠的轉角處彷彿有誰走過，脚步聲衝破街頭的死寂。睡着了都會　醒來吧！</p>
<h3>擦皮鞋的孩子</h3>
<p>— 林娜</p>
<p>（Manila的故事篇）</p>
<p>是一個爽朗的早晨，載重的貨車，巴經開始在多灰塵而且滿洋溢着煤臭的柏油道上，哄咚哄咚地嚮着了。西洛，一個沒家的孩子，這時也正從市民第一公園底水門汀板凳上醒了轉來。他輕輕的睜開那枯澀而含滿了倦意的眼睛，太陽柔和的光綫，刺得他不住地霎着。他想：不早了！嚇，該死……，於是便念急的爬起水門汀板凳，用髒袖口揩去眼睛上的眼屎和面上還沒乾掉的露濕。突然他覺得肚子裏有一種奇異的嚮聲，伸手去摸一摸才知道是餓了。</p>
<p>這時管園的鈴洛老頭底單調的乾咳聲，已經從一列梧桐樹下沈悶的響了過來。他心裏覺得非常不安和恐怖，便急急的抓住他底藏在水門汀板凳下的小木凳和木匣，站起想繞着一條通到街道的路上跑。但還沒跨開步時已經聽見管園人鈴洛老頭那熟稔了，兇狠而有點沙啞的吆喝聲：</p>
<p>看你替老子站着！</p>
<p>他剛一掉頭，管園人底粗木棍已在柔和的陽光下閃動了。他輕輕的顫抖着，也忘記了該是向管園人裝鬼面或伸一伸舌頭慣常動作的時候了，却跨開步一溜姻的向出口處奔過去。</p>
<p>街上擠滿了上辦公廳，工作塲底憂鬱了的人們，油金的汽車在街心大聲叫着：「都」，便飛也似的溜走，而駕着一架破篷車的馬則鳴着鼻子，尖聲的嘯着，豎起尾巴，踢着後脚，可是當車夫憤怒地在牠底背脊上狠狠的抽上幾下，便又靜寂寂的站着不動了。</p>
<p>西洛現花是在人羣中了，他感到了可怕的疲憊和憂悒，好些回幾乎要在人行道上絆倒，但總算是靠了上帝底庇祐，他被忽忽忙忙趕着跑路的人們擠住了。他腦子裏胡胡沉沉的，也不知道怎的却想起了幾年前底事來。</p>
<p>那時是一個不寗靜的六月天，Manila流散着虎列那，爸是馬車夫一天回家得很早，喊是頭痛過了三天便死了。而媽也受了傳染，是在爸死的隔天死的。這樣十二歲的西洛便沒了家。隔舍的五十二歲的摩洛老婆婆說是爲着上帝，拐着者邁的是偉向將近二一戶的隣居們哀求道：</p>
<p>看在仁慈上帝的面上，救救這個沒家的孤兒……</p>
<p>馬車夫扶西老人，慷慨地從他乾癟的袋子裏摸出了錢，捐了；接着大家也都捐了。這樣摩洛老婆婆便替他備辦了一隻小木凳，一個漆黑的木匣子，（而這漆黑的木匣子便藏着一些刷子，鞋膏和布條）叫他帶着上街去替人擦皮鞋，討生活。</p>
<p>而現在呢？家是摩洛老婆婆看在上帝的面上，帶着她八歲的小孩子搬去住了。他便只得退到市民第一公園去過夜。……</p>
<p>他慢慢的沿着羅沙禮的大街走，又轉過普洛克廣塲，然而，沒有一個客人向他叫道：「西洛，來！」於是他便跪在地底下細心的替他擦呀擦的，然後他丟下價值五仙的一個銀幣走了。</p>
<p>他開始覺得有點着急，肚子餓的使他皺眉尖，發抖，而且想哭泣，然而眼淚是不會塞飽人們空了底肚皮啊！</p>
<p>「擦皮鞋！」一個很嚮的聲調，我們底西洛得救了。他忙抬着頭看遠速的電車站上有一個上辦公廳的洋老爺在向他招手，於是他一面忙答應，一面飛也似的奔過云。</p>
<p>現在是洋老爺坐在他底小木凳上，兩脚伸得直直的在他底漆黑的小木匣上，嘴裏得意的抽着雪姻。而西洛則跪在他底面前，細心地替他在皮鞋上慢慢的塗鞋膏，刷，擦；於是那髒污的皮鞋漸漸的光亮起來，閃着光‘洋老爺滿足地從嘴角摘下雪茄姻頭丟在地下，一掉頭却已經在另一個人底嘴上了。西洛跪在前面，昻着頭用髒污的袖口揩着面上的汗珠。他很快活，因爲馬上便可以得到一頓飽足的早餐。</p>
<p>電車從遠地裏呻吟着飛奔過來，到站前停下了。洋老爺昻然地跨上車去，却忘了西洛擦皮鞋的工錢。西洛吃驚地</p>
<p>「老爺你忘了，擦皮鞋的工錢！」</p>
<p>却沒防在自己瘦削的屁股上反吃了那光亮鞋尖狠狠的一脚，他急往後退，還想追上去，電車却已呻吟着開走了，從那煤臭的空氣裏便拋下了一陣輕蔑的笑襲，有一個同胞却還從窗口伸出一個光滑的油金頭，向他狠狠的駡着了。</p>
<p>「小癟三，活該！」</p>
<p>「活該？我也是有氣有力去換來的啊！」西洛想着，便傷心地帶着他底小木凳和漆黑的木匣，到僻靜的地方去，偷偷的哭了。</p>
<h3>女神</h3>
<p>— 江敉作</p>
<p>那兩條鬥狗顓頊和共工，爲的要爭做元首，南面稱尊，在那裏爭執相將，一個說：我本是奉天承命的人，上帝特命我來統一天下！一個說：我不知道誇說甚麽上天下地，我是隨着我的本心想做皇帝。這兩條鬥狗，都抱着天無二日，民無二皇的决心，咆哮的結果，當然是引用武力，较箇長短。（七）</p>

<p>今朝呀，只有今朝我還能忍受這苦痛的煎熬。明朝呀，明朝我的歌喉破了，我的皮肉腐了，那時候，便是無用的煤渣，被棄在寂寞的荒郊。都是一樣父母生要分貴和賤，有錢的享盡榮華福，無錢賣身入勾欄，挨不盡打駡和飢寒，受不盡　辱和摧殘。憑我這嘶啞的歌喉，憑我這殘破的身體，去迎合那有錢的游蕩漢，去給那貪婪的鴇母，賺取血肉錢。今朝呀，只有今朝我還能忍受這苦痛的煎熬。明朝呀，明朝我的歌喉破了，我的皮肉腐了，那時候，便是無用煤渣，被棄在寂寞的荒郊。</p>

<p>開篇「才情」</p>
<p>一分才調一分情·到得才高情也深·佳人無不憐才子。才子由來愛美人。竟又一端可恨處。爲什麽。情長情短不均勻。想變過情。非是今朝起。當初不少故來人。也有的。始則亂之終則棄。也有的。前成仇敵後成姻。可知曉李益無情忘前約。王魁負意誤前盟。學不得。宋宏不棄糟糠婦。學不得。六昌公主不重婚。非是人情分厚薄。祇緣才淺與才深。可曉得。夢到柳邊皆好合。詩題葉上也婚姻。可笑世人迷不悟。把竊玉偷香當正經。露水夫妻算算眞。爭風吃醋成何禮。徒惹風波不太平。然而。風情一事人難免。總又交情誤幾分。呌得陶情處且陶情。</p>

<p>滅寇功成衣錦回。朱春登奉旨返鄉關。那知。不見慈親妻子面。忙呼嬸母問行爲。很心婦。有口才。道一雙婆媳赴泉台。聞言好比轟雷打。哭斷肝腸恨滿懷。開墳吊週濟貧窮輩。超度亡靈好事爲。又誰知。婆媳二人猶在世。連遭家縫避深山。牧羊人共羣羊住。眼望家庭不敢歸。含淚忍悲同乞食。相逢夫婦在墳台。觀眉目。各驚猜。一番盤問理應該。方知嬸母良心傷。哭抽萱堂淚不干。當塲易服變　誥。苦盡甜來一轉眉。惡婦此時心着急。跪中央設誓解疑猜。那曉得。誓言未畢蒼龍至。頃刻之間骨化灰。自家作孽不可違。</p>

<h3>古代浴園建築的探討（上）</h3>
<p>— 孫宗文</p>
<p>—羅馬國家建築藝術結晶品之一—</p>
<p>「浴園建築」（ThermaeArchitecture）是一個似乎比較生疏的名詞；雖然它亦是世界建築物中之一種藝術品。其所以一般人所不甚注意者，考其原因，不外二點：一、就歷史方面而言：因建築就是「歷史的記錄」；所以有某一類建築物之出現，就足可代表這一個國家的興盛，及其　族的特性；所以可說它是時代，環境，和民族性的結晶品。古今中外，世界上的人類最受到好威的，就是宗敎？所以建築物中挺偉大挺華麗，而人民最喜歡去建築的也就是「宗敎的建築」。我們看吧！從有世界一直到現代以來，那一時期一般人民不時時刻刻致力於宗敎方面的建築呢！自誕生到現在巳經有數千年星霜的金字塔以來，繼着就有古埃及神秘的廟堂，希臘宏麗的神廟，羅馬莊嚴的寺院，一直到現代偉大幽靜的基督敎堂爲止；其中有無其數的宗敎建築物出現於世界！並且更奇怪的，我們的建築藝術，也好像就是一種宗敎的藝術之替身，因爲其每一部份，莫不象徵宗敎精神意味來。其原因就是在過去的歷史上，左右意匠勢力最大的，就是宗敎。建築我們旣證明了它是一種「歷史的記錄」，所一部世界建築史的中心，就以宗敎的建築爲主體：而現在所要談的「浴園建築」旣同宗敎無關，那也何怪乎要被一般人所忽視了。二、就藝術方面而言；世界的建築，旣以宗敎爲重心，所以藝術的技巧，就特別注力於宗敎的建築物上而。「浴園」旣是一種冷門的東西，如以從古以來又極少偉大可觀的代表作出現，所以其對於藝術本身上講，更少供獻；因之世界上一般研究建築藝術的，對於它就减少不少的興趣；其結果就成了一頁不十分重要的材料，留存在我們的建築史上面了。</p>
<p>浴園旣是一個不重要的建築物，那麽我們又何必要去研究呢？不錯，近代的浴園，故不值得去探討的；但是古代的浴園，是實在有研究的價值在着。在古代有同宮殿一樣的偉大，同廟堂一樣的神秘，同神廟一樣的華麗的浴園在，並且或許比宗敎的建築有更珍奇，更鮮麗，更纖巧，的作品在呢！這些藝術的結晶品藏在何處？那我們可以不用思索的說出來：「美麗的羅馬」，好，我們就以羅馬的浴園建築藝術，作爲探討的重心罷！</p>
<p>羅馬的文化，雖是承繼希臘的文化；然而也有不同的地方；因爲羅馬人是一個重實行的民族；他們的想像力遠不如希臘人的覺富，但是他們的頭腦冷靜，鎭定，富於常識，却是其民族性特質之一；並且羅馬人富於公衆性的，所以公共的建築特別地發達。並且當時的公共衛生也很創明；因之，浴園之建築，亦先後在各地出現了。並且羅馬時代，可說是「浴園建築」的黃金時代；其技巧之精，藝術之美，不亞於希臘之「神廟」；而况牠又是羅馬國家建築藝術結晶品之一呢！</p>
<p>羅馬人尤重服從性，所以於他們的皇帝，特別地服從；他們認為皇帝的權力，大於一切，因之，各地之宮殿建築，特別的偉大壯麗了。而浴園爲宮殿的附屬建築，所以浴園之建築，亦跟着興起；此浴園所以發達原因之一也。查浴園的起始，在埃及已經有了；然而規模粗具，迨希臘市府開幕，人民生活增高，社會注重衛生，故浴園極力提倡之；一至羅馬崛起，則浴園可算得眞正的建築時期了，因當時偉大的代表作先後出現了不少，尤其在尼羅（Nero）帝君時代，其浴園規模之宏偉，材料之採自萬國，技藝之窮於百工，洵足以代表羅馬帝國之尊榮。記得從前有一張影片，名叫「羅宮春色」的；內景有幾慕係皇宮的浴園，其佈景之富麗，雕刻之精美，眞令人觀嘆不化呢上從銀幕中，我們亦可想見當時浴園建築藝術之一斑了。雖近今歐美人士講求技藝，然一見羅馬之港園，想亦要驚嘆不止呢！</p>
<h3>家屋的利用法</h3>
<p>— 乾眞介著　張廣正譯</p>
<p>家屋，卽生活的容器。然，在此容器中的家庭生活情况，是時行變遷。例如隨年代的前進，於是家長發生更替。若一家的收入增加，便會引起趣味及愛好的向上。對家屋方面，常會進而請求兒童住房與父兄書壽的設立或隔離</p>
<p>因此，卽使以前是在極周到的計劃下建築的家屋，若稍經時問，從而自然會感到不足使用。何况現時薪水生活者的大多數所住的，類多租來的住宅。則其在日常生活上所感到的不便，可想而知。</p>
<p>然，家屋經一次建築以後，卽爲不動產。此後所需的手續，便祇是照料。而一般屋主於住客遷居之際，因深恐此等照料修改費用的補償，發生麻煩，故雅不欲租客隨意修改家屋，因而往往對這點加以限制。由於此等關係，故卽使欲企圖將不滿足的部份加以修改，以順應自己的生活，而求達到更快適的情度，亦不可能。</p>
<p>這樣，在改造或大加修理不可能的範圍中，難道沒有一更巧妙的住居方法嗎？以下所述，就是不費多金，僅靠良好的佈置，而能快適佳良地住居家屋的簡單方法。</p>
<p>（一）門口的關鎖式</p>
<p>爲了愼防意外，最好是裝西式的門。於門板或墻壁某一部位開一小穴，裝上玻璃，以作看窗，裏面最好披蓋上一塊薄麗的絹綢。來訪者爲何人，經此一看，就可極安心地開門延入了。</p>
<p>其次，關於鎖鑰。若門式爲單扇的，則有一種叫做「正鎖」。將把手的中央，扣於側面，從內面下鍵，外面决不易弄開。其處理方法亦極便利，祇要當人出入時，隨手帶上，外面便不會給推開了。</p>
<p>還有一種叫做安全鎖的，其優點是不易自外弄開。且門口的開張，有一定闊度。鎖爲金製的。紐約的住戶多用之</p>
<p>（二）裝上紗窗</p>
<p>在新建築地帶，每當夏夜，蚊蟲成羣結隊飛來，討厭已極。若於窗口裝上細鐵絲網，便可防止。能如是，則旣可接受夏夜的凉風，同時，亦可防禦蚊蟲的襲擊。且裝置費用不大，獲益則甚爲不淺。製成紗網框，於不用時亦易除下。</p>
<p>又，如裝置百葉窗與玻璃窗的家屋，若以紗窗代替玻璃窗，則亦可達到如上的目的。</p>
<p>（三）廚房效能的增進</p>
<p>在廚房方面，於煮燒用的煤氣器具及竈上設備包裹型鉛皮製的蓋，將之導至姻突，而於其端裝一換氣機，將臭氣排除戶外。換氣作用，若裝一小型電扇，可得良好效果。</p>
<p>魚骨，肉骨，菜屑等廢物，處理非常麻煩細碎，且極易穢污廚房。從廚房內用念傾斜的鉛管，貫穿牆壁，通出外面。先置備一大桶，集放廢物，時時自管中傾去，此亦一較善辦法。</p>
<p>（四）洗面室，浴室及便所</p>
<p>有特築的洗面室設置的家屋，類多已相當完備。至於一般小住宅，每朝洗臉，多利用廚房從事。然，於處理食具及食料的塲所，諸多不潔及不便。故最好能在浴室一隅，設置洗臉器具。若浴室不備或狹小，最好於外廊一端，在水管旁設置洗面器具。旣極簡單，且亦並不難看。尤其是對於養成兒童餐前洗手的習慣這點，更爲適合。</p>
<p>在浴室壁上，掛一與牆壁同顏色的布袋，可用作放置牙刷，牙膏，肥皂等物，亦至適合。</p>
<p>便所若有三五方尺廣闊。可於其一隅置一能放花盆，花束及香爐等物的架子。這麽一來，將不潔的塲所，便改成較爲良好愉服的地方了。香氣固爲蒼蠅所嫌惡的，因之，亦可將蒼蠅驅除不少</p>
<p>（五）書齋及兒童住房</p>
<p>有效地使用狹小的書齊，不防多放書架。祗要把書籍能有條不紊地擺好，而不致阻碍門的開閉及出入便得。</p>
<p>致於兒童住房，擺設最好簡單而又時時變換。於出入口，設較大的壁鏡及洗手具等，使兒童養成淸潔習慣。誠然，兒童們的搬砂運石，拖泥帶水，常會將房屋內部弄成不潔。但此乃兒童好動天性，亦一不可過於勉强的事。</p>
<p>（六）窗檐下的利用</p>
<p>向東南隅的窗戶，在家屋中，乃一日光射入最良好的路徑，可盡量使之空闊。且新式的家屋，多在這方面開窗。夏季旣可引入凉風，冬季亦可避免直襲的寒風，保持適當的溫度。反之，向西北方面的窗檐下，最妙的是能植些花木，可使環境更形美化。</p>
<h3>工廠建築之設計（下）</h3>
<p>— 伯屏</p>
<p>（一）平房而論，牠佔的面積最大，如果在地價極高的上海，馬上就不合算了，但是因爲牠的建築，是互相連接的，這一部分的東西做好了，送到這二部分，這樣一來，製造很有程序，極易於管理，並且光綫總是比較的充足，空氣也很新鮮。</p>
<p>（二）樓層！因爲地價太貴的緣故，所以我們的工廠建築，就有幾層以至數十層不等，這樣一來，工作的塲所就多了，不過鍋鑪引擎等等，必定要安置在地下一層，以免危險，就是樓上的塲所，也只適宜於輕便的工作。</p>
<p>（三）大間式！這種建築，最適宜於多人工作之工廠，如打鐵等。</p>
<p>（四）分離式—危險性工廠的建築，最好一部一部的分開，因爲一間發生了危險，免得影響到其他的部分，如火藥廠及火柴廠等等。</p>
<p>（三）材料之選擇</p>
<p>近世工廠建築，以安全爲主要設計，故各國對於工廠建築的材料，都有一定的規定，普通應用的，有木，石，鐵及鋼骨混凝土四種：</p>
<p>（一）木—不十分堅固，但價格極廉，建築迅速，易於修理，短期而無危險性之工廠，多樂用之。</p>
<p>（二）石—不着火，抗力極强，但運輸不易，視當地出產石料遠近而定。</p>
<p>（三）鐵—鐵式建築，在中國是很少的，着火當然不易，但是很容易傳熱，牠的好處，就是建造迅速，修理很少而已</p>
<p>（四）鋼骨混凝土，這是最新式的建築材料，堅固之外，又不易着火，不要修理，不過價格太貴了一點。</p>
<p>（四）光綫之設計</p>
<p>光綫的設計，也要很重要的，最好是夭然的太陽光，所以對於屋頂及天窗的設計，應愼重去考慮，屋頂的設計，就是爲這個目的，普通所用的有鋸形屋項（Sawlype）式，談到窗的設計，務使（一）光綫充足，散佈全室（二）避免太陽直射，使有反射光。</p>
<p>（五）安全設備之設計</p>
<p>（一）太平門—每座建築，根據建築法規的規定，應有三個至五個的太平門，門是向外一推就開的。</p>
<p>（二）太平桶—五個至十個的太平桶，滿滿的貯藏着水。</p>
<p>（三）太平梯—這是樓層式的建築物所必需的。</p>

<h3>The Fifth Plenary Session Opens Yesterday; All Central Committee Members Take the Oath of Office; After the Ceremony, a Preparatory Meeting Is Held; The Presidium and Secretary-General Are Elected</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Fifth Central Executive and Supervisory Committee Members held a memorial ceremony at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum at 8:00 a.m. on the 2nd. Around 7:00 a.m., they traveled out of the city by car and gathered at the mausoleum. From Zhongshan Gate to the surroundings of the mausoleum, the area was heavily guarded by military police. At 8:00 a.m. sharp, in the open space in front of the mausoleum's memorial hall, they stood in rows according to age. Under the leadership of Chairman Yu Youren, they performed the ceremony and presented wreaths. Then, they entered the spirit chamber to pay their respects to the deceased leader's remains. After the ceremony, they returned to the Central Party Headquarters to take a group photo. At 9:30 a.m., they jointly held the weekly memorial service for the late Premier and the oath-taking ceremony, as well as the opening ceremony of the First Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Committee. After Chairman Wu Jingheng conducted the ceremony, all Central Committee members, under Wu's supervision, raised their right hands and recited the oath. They then signed and stamped the oath forms, which were sent to the Secretariat for filing. Wu then delivered the opening address. The ceremony concluded at 9:40 a.m. At 10:00 a.m. in the First Conference Hall, ten members, including Ren Yiren, Zou Lu, Gu Mengyu, and Ding Weifen, were elected to form the Presidium of the First Plenary Session. (2) Ye Chucang was elected as Secretary-General. (3) The session was scheduled to last from the 3rd to [illegible]. The Presidium decided on the candidates for the various review committees for the five groups: politics, economy, education, and military and reported them to the general assembly. The meeting adjourned at 10:20 a.m. The general assembly was scheduled to hold its first meeting at 9:00 a.m. on the 3rd. The Presidium had already discussed the agenda after the preparatory meeting on the 2nd and decided on the list of members for the proposal review committees. The group review meetings will be held on the afternoon of the 3rd. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Wu Jingheng's Opening Speech</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman of the Assembly Wu Jingheng delivered the opening speech. The original text is as follows: "Fellow comrades, today is the swearing-in ceremony of the Fifth Central Executive and Supervisory Committee members of our party, and at the same time, we are holding the opening ceremony of the first plenary session of the Fifth Central Executive and Supervisory Committee. This Fifth National Congress can be regarded as the most united meeting of our party. All comrades with strength within the party have been enriched into the central government. Now the situation is difficult, and it also requires many comrades with strength to support the critical situation. Today we are holding the first plenary session, and I hope that all comrades will actively find ways to realize the various proposals submitted by the congress. This is the first point. Secondly, I hope that all the phenomena of our party's past that were not very vigorous will be reorganized in this meeting. I also hope that everyone will think of ways to support the current difficult situation, so that everything will be more enriched and satisfactory at the Sixth National Congress in the future, so as not to fail the trust of this congress."

<h3>The Far East Crisis and the Naval Conference</h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>The Naval Conference will be held in London on December 6. Given the urgency of the Far East situation and the hopelessness of peace in Europe, we know that the chances of success for this conference are minimal. However, at a time when international peace has no other way out and the fate of mankind is approaching its final decision, we believe that the naval negotiations between Britain, the United States, and Japan may help to resolve the current problems in any case. The current problem is the victory or bankruptcy of collective peace, and other than collective peace, there is only the path of international war.</p>
<p>The naval conference wants to discuss nothing more than the limitation of the quantity and quality of the naval forces of the naval powers. But this problem itself cannot be discussed. Britain advocates limiting the tonnage and caliber of guns of battleships. Japan advocates abolishing battleships and aircraft carriers, etc. The United States advocates abolishing submarines. This is a matter of quality. Britain, based on its defense relations, advocates having the world's largest total naval tonnage. Japan advocates abolishing the five-five-three ratio and is willing to be equal to the United States. The United States advocates maintaining the five-three ratio between the US and Japan and maintaining equality with Britain. This is a matter of quantity. But what standard should be used to solve the problem of quantity and quality? What is the purpose of large tonnage and aggressive weapons? If the cause of armaments is not clarified, then merely talking about disarmament will lead to no results.</p>
<p>Therefore, the naval conference, if it does not discuss political issues, if it does not resolve the current political disputes between Britain, the United States, and Japan in the Far East, will have no hope of any success. Previously, President Harding convened the naval conference in Washington, using the Nine-Power Treaty and the Four-Power Treaty as the basis for the naval treaty. The Nine-Power Treaty maintained the territorial integrity and sovereignty of China. The Four-Power Treaty maintained the status quo in the Pacific, with each country not invading each other and no longer establishing naval bases. With these two treaties, the countries felt somewhat safer and were willing to sacrifice part of their existing armaments as an expression of their efforts for peace. Now the Nine-Power Treaty has been completely destroyed. The four northeastern provinces have already been occupied by Japan, and North China is also in turmoil. In China, the balance of power between Britain, the United States, and Japan has long been shaken. In the Pacific, due to the expansion of Japan's economic, political, and military power, the withdrawal of the United States from the Philippines, and Britain's lack of time to look east, the balance is also difficult to maintain. The political foundation has been lost, and talking about disarmament is extremely difficult.</p>
<p>To ensure the smooth progress of the naval conference, political negotiations must begin first. To make political negotiations possible, Japan must change its attitude. If Japan's ambitions in North China are actively developing and it refuses to abandon the so-called Monroe Doctrine of Asia, then talking about disarmament with other countries is like seeking skin from a tiger. How can Japan change its attitude? The answer is that it depends on the promotion of external forces. What are these external forces? The cooperation of Britain and the United States, China's self-awareness, and the positive role of the Soviet Union are all external forces. The rulers of Japan are already intoxicated with militarism. Without the pressure of external forces, they will never take a step back. Among the three forces, China's self-awareness is the most important. If our nation has the determination to defend the country and the courage to sacrifice, it can win the sympathy of the world and promote the realization of peace. The success or failure of the naval conference and whether peace in the Far East can be maintained depends on the efforts and determination of our 400 million people.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Plans to Mint Subsidiary Coins</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Financial circles report that when the Ministry of Finance announced the implementation of the new currency, the public, not understanding the underlying reasons, was inevitably suspicious for a time.

<p>(Nanjing) The impact of the implementation of the new currency system on all sectors of society and the government's ongoing plans are of great concern to the people of the country. The reporter recently learned the following from relevant sources: (1) When the Ministry of Finance initially announced the implementation of the new currency system, the public, not understanding the underlying reasons, was inevitably suspicious for a time. After the government's earnest explanation and the mutual praise of friendly countries, prices and exchange rates have returned to normal. However, the exchange rate of copper coins in Beiping and Hankou is still rising. The Ministry of Finance is now planning to issue copper coin notes to adjust the situation, which should reduce the exchange rate. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance is minting new subsidiary coins in silver, nickel, and copper, which will soon be in circulation. In the future, the exchange of legal tender will be more convenient due to the circulation of new subsidiary coins, and the exchange rate will be more stable.

<h3>Canada Announces Opposition to Expanding Sanctions Scope; Sudden Change in Attitude After Cabinet Reshuffle; Goes Back on its Word, Cancels Oil Embargo Recommendation; London and Geneva Greatly Surprised</h3>
<p>Ottawa: The Canadian government, wishing to avoid any connection with suggestions that could provoke war, announced today that it "does not recognize any promises that bind Canada to take military sanctions," and solemnly declared that the remarks made by the Canadian permanent representative to the League of Nations, Riddell, in Geneva regarding the oil and coal embargo against Italy, "are Riddell's personal opinion and do not represent the Canadian government." The government has denied external reports that Canada advocated expanding the scope of the arms embargo to include all major products, stating that "although the government supports economic sanctions against Italy, it does not recognize any promises that bind Canada to accept military sanctions, as no such promises can be made before being approved by Parliament." The Canadian government is very willing to assist the League of Nations in testing the effectiveness of economic sanctions, but it must not involve military sanctions. The government also does not wish to take the lead; it must observe the actions of other countries before deciding whether to follow suit. The government also stated that Italy has declared that banning oil transportation is a military sanction that could provoke war. Therefore, the most important point of the government's statement today is to deny Riddell's position in Geneva and to indicate that Canada has not formally promoted the suggestion to expand the scope of sanctions to include major products such as oil and coal. (1st National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The Canadian government's rejection of its representative to the League of Nations' suggestion to expand sanctions against Italy to include oil, coal, and steel has greatly surprised diplomatic circles here. The British Cabinet is likely to convene a special meeting to discuss this statement. However, official circles are unwilling to make any criticism before a clear explanation of this declaration. Diplomats believe that this is a warning from Canada to Britain, meaning that if Britain and Italy provoke war by strengthening sanctions, Canada does not want Britain to assume that Canada is morally obligated to assist Britain. However, critics in Britain believe that this interpretation seems excessive. Official circles here believe that since the League of Nations Eighteen-Nation Committee has already approved in principle the proposal to expand the scope of the arms embargo, Canada cannot possibly withdraw its proposal. Therefore, unless Canada's statement can overturn the entire proposal, the League of Nations will still announce the coal and oil embargo, and the announcement will be made before Christmas. Once the coal and oil embargo is announced, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will try to resume peace talks. Observers here generally believe that Mussolini, being a clever person, will not risk a suicidal war with fifty countries. (1st National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Canada's announcement of opposition to expanding the scope of sanctions to include an oil embargo, and its denial of its League of Nations representative's statement, has shocked the member states of the League of Nations today. The chairman of the League of Nations Sanctions Committee, the Portuguese representative Goncalves, stated that the Canadian government's statement will not affect the resolution of the Eighteen-Nation Committee. However, other representatives also stated that since Canada's attitude has changed, the expansion of sanctions at the meeting of the Eighteen-Nation Committee on December 12 will be hindered. As for the Canadian representative Riddell, he could not be met today, so it was not possible to inquire about his opinion on the statement issued by the Ottawa government. It is generally believed that Riddell's proposal for a coal and oil embargo was instructed by the former Prime Minister Bennett's Conservative government. Now that the government has changed, the Liberal cabinet's Prime Minister King has not given him new instructions. (1st National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Using Recuperation as a Pretext, Hoare Will Visit Paris to Meet with Laval to Discuss the Situation in Abyssinia; Eden to Serve as Acting Foreign Secretary</h3>

Therefore, he is scheduled to depart for Switzerland on Saturday, with a short stopover in Paris to meet with French Prime Minister Laval. The naval conference, which will open on December 9, will be attended by Lord Stanhope, the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in Hoare's place. During Hoare's absence, the duties of Foreign Secretary will be assumed by Eden, a Minister without Portfolio. (2nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Canada's Statement Does Not Affect the League of Nations; Oil Embargo Against Italy Has Been Approved in Principle; Britain Expresses Unwillingness to Take Military Action Alone</h3>
<p>(Geneva) League of Nations officials believe that it is no longer important whether Canadian representative Riddell's advocacy of an oil embargo against Italy represents his own opinion or that of his government. This is because the draft resolution on the oil embargo has been approved in principle by the Eighteen-Nation Committee, and the governments of Soviet Russia, Romania, and other countries have also sent letters expressing their approval. People here believe that the origin of the oil embargo proposal can no longer affect the establishment of this case. When the Eighteen-Nation Committee meets on December 12, it will only study how to make this resolution effective. It is generally believed that Canada will not adopt an opposing or obstructing attitude. (2nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) People in London now advocate that when the Eighteen-Nation Committee meets on December 12, Britain should strongly urge its passage of the oil embargo against Italy. However, Britain will only participate in collective resolutions and does not want to take unilateral oil embargo action. Informed non-political circles generally feel that if the League of Nations cannot implement an oil embargo against Italy, dissatisfaction will inevitably arise in the United States, because the United States has expressed its support for this sanction.

<h3>British Cabinet Meeting to Preserve Peace Negotiations Between Italy and Abyssinia; Believes the Opportunity Has Matured</h3>
<p>(London) Since the League of Nations has postponed the issue of an oil embargo against Italy until next week for discussion, the British Cabinet meeting held this afternoon will only discuss diplomatic affairs as usual. It is expected that the Cabinet meeting will also pass the British Emperor's address to the new Parliament, which will be published in the House of Lords at noon tomorrow. (2nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Baldwin convened a Cabinet meeting today to reaffirm Britain's adherence to its established policy in dealing with the Italian-Abyssinian war and to disregard Mussolini's threats. The meeting discussed the oil embargo issue and adopted military plans for the defense of the British Empire. It was also understood that while the British Empire's policy is sincerely committed to promoting peace negotiations without humiliating Italy, any diplomatic concessions must be made by Italy. The Cabinet will meet again on Friday, and the Italian Cabinet will also hold an important Cabinet meeting tomorrow. According to informed sources, the basis for peace negotiations has not yet been established. The most active mediator is still French Foreign Minister Laval. However, it is heard that the Italian side's attitude has softened considerably. London now believes that the next two weeks will be the final critical moment for Europe. (2nd National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) It is reported that tomorrow's Cabinet meeting will not only determine Britain's final attitude towards the oil embargo issue and the government's instructions to be entrusted to Minister without Portfolio Eden to attend the meeting of the Eighteen-Nation Committee on December 12, but will also discuss the Italian-Abyssinian peace plan jointly drafted by British and French experts in Paris. According to the peace plan recently drafted in Paris by Sanderson, an expert on Abyssinian issues from the British Foreign Office, and Saint-Quentin, director of East African affairs from the French Foreign Office, although it does not bind Britain, the British government urgently needs to study whether it can accept this plan. If the Cabinet studies and believes that it can be accepted, then it may be jointly proposed to the Italian government by Britain and France before the Eighteen-Nation Committee passes the implementation of the oil embargo. (1st Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) Regarding the fact that Britain and France are now drafting proposals to resolve the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, Italian officials explained that Italy is prepared to negotiate, but will not make any demands that would harm British interests in Abyssinia. Although Britain also recognizes its interests in Abyssinia, it does not feel threatened. However, on the other hand, it repeatedly uses respect for the sovereignty of the Abyssinian Emperor as a pretext, which actually hinders the establishment of a compromise. This is why Mussolini's negotiations with British Ambassador Drummond have not been successful so far. (2nd Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>The United States' Attitude Toward Sanctions Against Italy is Strong; In Addition to Restricting War Materials to Belligerent Countries, It Does Not Plan to Adopt More Severe Measures</h3>
<p>(Washington) The State Department's attitude towards sanctions against Italy is quite strong today. Therefore, the United States government will continue to maintain its policy of restricting "major" materials shipped to belligerent countries, not exceeding normal quantities. Official circles are unwilling to criticize Canada's statement, but stated that this action will not affect the United States' policy.

<p>(Washington) It is rumored that the Italian Ambassador to the United States has lodged a protest with the State Department against the tendency of the United States' neutrality procedures to favor the League of Nations. According to the New York American, the Italian Ambassador warned the State Department that if it expands its existing actions to restrict the supply of war materials to Italy, the United States will fall into Britain's trap and make the European war more likely to break out. However, reliable sources say that the United States does not plan to take any action other than trying to persuade people not to lightly supply war materials to belligerent countries, because existing upper legislative bills do not allow the adoption of more severe measures.

<h3>Abyssinia Plans to Establish an Embassy in Washington, D.C.</h3>
<p>Cairo: The secretary of the Abyssinian embassy here, Taffere, announced today that he will depart for the United States on December 7 on the orders of the government. The provincial government has learned that President Roosevelt reportedly welcomes Taffere's trip as a precursor to Abyssinia's plan to establish an embassy in Washington, D.C. Although the United States sent Soost as its ambassador to Abyssinia at the time of the Abyssinian Emperor's coronation, and there is now Engert as the chargé d'affaires in the Abyssinian capital, Washington has not yet had an Abyssinian embassy.

<h3>The Abyssinian Government Seeks Loans from American Banks by Indirect Means; Prominent New York Broker Claims to Have Obtained Abyssinia's Oil Mining Concession Rights</h3>
<p>(Paris) Keetok, a prominent New York broker who came to England to negotiate with Dr. Martin, the Abyssinian ambassador to England, about the coal and oil mining concession rights, has recently traveled with Taffere, the secretary of the Abyssinian embassy, from London to the United States. It is rumored that Abyssinia plans to borrow one million pounds from the United States. According to the London correspondent of the Paris Echo, it has been officially confirmed that Keetok issued a statement before leaving, saying that he had obtained the coal and oil mining concession rights in southwestern Abyssinia, and that all the funds required were raised in the United Kingdom, so that the American government would not intervene, as it did previously in the Rickett incident (Note: Rickett signed a coal and oil mining concession agreement with the Abyssinian government in September of this year on behalf of the American Mobil Oil Company, but Mobil Oil eventually abandoned the concession after accepting the advice of the State Department.)

<h3>Sanctions Harm National Dignity; Italy Experiences Spiritual Pain; Resistance Movement Sings Loudly to the Clouds; Restricting Consumption and Conscripting Hidden Wealth</h3>
<p>(Rome) It is reported that the Italian government now plans to continue negotiations in order to resolve the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, but with the prerequisite of preserving the interests and honor related to Italy's survival. As for what kind of reaction will be caused after the League of Nations implements an oil embargo, the Italian government believes that it is still difficult to determine at this time, but stated that the oil embargo will be regarded as harming Italy's national dignity. So far, the pain that sanctions have inflicted on Italy is spiritually greater than economically. Since the League of Nations implemented sanctions, the daily life of the Italian people</p>
<p>Continued on page 7</p>
<h2>Page 7</h2>
<p>has not undergone major changes. All the measures to restrict consumption were already being implemented before the sanctions were imposed, so the impact on the lives of ordinary people after the implementation of sanctions is very limited. The market prices of various foods have not risen significantly. People still go to theaters and cinemas to watch plays as usual in the evenings, but instead of closing at midnight as usual, they now close one hour earlier, at 11:00 p.m. In addition, the market price of coal and oil has increased from 2.5 lire per kilogram to 5.5 lire. The people are enthusiastically participating in the resistance movement against sanctions and are unanimously proud of it, because more than 50 countries have implemented sanctions. This is "the most powerful united front in history," and it is being used to deal with Italy, but Italy has not yet surrendered. Therefore, Italians are taking pride in it. The domestic movement to conscript gold and other metals is still ongoing. The authorities are also using multiple trucks with national flags hanging on them to collect scrap iron in various places. In addition, members of the Fascist Party are appealing to those who own jewelry to hand over their jewelry to the state or at least not to flaunt it in public places in order to avoid the habit of extravagance. Foreign books and newspapers are no longer seen in bookstores, and foreign languages are also being excluded. Advertisements for whiskey and ginger ale sold in pubs have been hidden, because both names are in English. "Sandwiches" (i.e., bread with ham, chicken, or fish) were originally a popular English name. If you ask a waiter for a "sandwich" in a Roman pub, the people sitting next to you will look at you askance. In addition, the streets in Rome that used foreign place names have also been changed uniformly. In the midst of this resistance movement singing loudly to the clouds, although the general public still expresses calmness, they are sometimes inevitably uneasy. (2nd Havas News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) Mussolini spoke today to a group of 846 mothers from the 94 provincial committees representing the widows of soldiers, saying that economic sanctions are not enough to harm Italy, because Italy today has unprecedented abundance of raw materials. This action only makes Italy spiritually unhappy. Mussolini received these people in the famous Palazzo Venezia, earnestly requesting them to help him resist this dishonorable economic encirclement of Italy. (1st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Abyssinian Road Army Occupies and Withdraws from Magar; Italian Army's Withdrawal from Magar is Feared to be an Enemy Enticement Strategy</h3>
<p>Harar: According to Abyssinian news received here today, the Abyssinian army has occupied the town of Amar, near the territory of Webi Shebeli in Italian Somaliland. One army under the command of Abyssinian General Taysta is currently engaged in a major battle with the Italian army near Webi Shibeli. (1st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa Special Correspondent O'Shaughnessy reports that good news has been spreading here about the Abyssinian army on the Ogaden front, saying that General Nasibu, the commander-in-chief of the Abyssinian army on the southern route, and his troops, along with Turkish General Wehib, are advancing rapidly along the only route from Harar to Gola Hai, traveling 30 kilometers per day. General Nasibu's troops are now only 80 kilometers away from the city of Sassabane. It is also said that the Abyssinian army has repeatedly invaded Somaliland and has occupied the area of Amara, near the Italian city of Abhya. (1st Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: Political circles today expressed fear about the Italian army's withdrawal from Magal, deeply worried that this is a cunning plot by the Italian army to lure the Abyssinian army into a trap and destroy it. The Abyssinian Minister of the Army has warned General Seyoum to be careful not to fall for the trick. Informed sources are highly skeptical about whether the claim that the Italian army has completely withdrawn from the southern route is reliable. It is generally believed that the main purpose of the Italian army is to advance north in order to avoid the extreme heat and smelly water of Ogaden, coupled with the plague of camel ticks, which afflicts both humans and animals. General Taysta, who is currently stationed with a large army of 20,000 men on the southwestern front, reported that he has curbed the northward advance of the Italian mechanized units from Dolo along the Ganale Dorya River.

<h3>Italian Army Transports 100 Aircraft to East Africa</h3>

<h3>Italian Bombs Fail to Explode Upon Landing</h3>
<p>(London) A Reuters war correspondent telegraphed from a location south of Jijiga, saying that a large batch of war supplies is now being transported to the army of Abyssinian General Nasibu. When Italian planes attacked Dakaba, they dropped bombs worth thousands of pounds, but they did not achieve any results. Many bombs did not explode upon landing. Also, two planes were shot down by Abyssinian soldiers while flying low near Webi Shibeli. Italian planes, realizing that flying low is very dangerous, now no longer fly at altitudes below 3,000 feet, making it very difficult to take accurate aim. The health conditions of the Abyssinian army are excellent, with three-quarters of the beds in the battlefield hospitals empty. The Abyssinian army has no fear of lacking food, as the supply of dried wheat is very abundant. This is the main food for the Abyssinian army, and bullets are also very plentiful.

In addition to General and Mrs. De Bono and their entourage, the ship was also carrying 420 soldiers who were returning home on sick leave. (1st Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>After the Implementation of Our Currency Policy, Foreign Exchange Remains Stable, and Silver Prices are Gradually Stabilizing, As Expected; The United States Decides to Give Our Country a Chance to Experiment</h3>
<p>(Washington) Financiers here believe that the continued stability of the exchange rate between Chinese currency and the US dollar and the British pound proves that China, even in the midst of this uncertain political situation in North China, is still able to manage its currency. Officials here indicated today that China must have made every effort in recent weeks to manage its currency and maintain the position of Chinese currency, otherwise Japan's attitude towards China's new currency policy would have caused drastic changes. According to a still unconfirmed report from informed sources, although Japanese private parties sold a large number of yen two weeks ago, the Chinese were able to maintain the stability of the currency price. The stabilization of silver prices today has confirmed the prediction published by the Associated Press in November, which stated that the United States would do its best to give China the opportunity to freely implement and test its new currency policy.

<h3>Japanese People Cause Trouble Drunk in Tianjin</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 2nd, a Japanese man named Nishimura came to Tianjin from Guye. In the British Concession, he shouted slogans such as "Realize the autonomy of North China" and "East Asian peace". He then took out a pistol and loaded it in the street. Fearing that people would see him, he entered the nearby Victoria Hospital. A nurse at the hospital saw him and asked what he was doing. Nishimura fired a shot into the air and chased the nurse upstairs, causing chaos in the hospital. Several American doctors worked together to seize the gun, resulting in a physical struggle. Nishimura then took out a dagger and attempted to stab them. A large number of British police officers arrived and arrested him. According to his statement, he had just arrived in Tianjin from Guye and intended to enter the Japanese Concession, but a misunderstanding occurred due to drunkenness. The British Municipal Council has protested to the Japanese Consulate. (Special dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<h3>The British Empire News Agency - London Builds Nine-Story Mansion - Grand Scale and Perfect Equipment - Reuters and the Associated Press Cooperate Closely - A New Era of World News Exchange Opens</h3>
<p>London Dispatch: A large building is about to be built on Fleet Street in London for Reuters News Agency and the British Associated Press. All British Empire and foreign communication agencies related to Reuters, as well as newspaper agencies that have direct contact with the Associated Press, will also be included. This will be the largest and best-equipped news exchange location in the world. The design of the new building was planned by Sir Edwin Lutyens.</p>
<p>Twelve years ago, Reuters in London expanded its business, and its original century-old building could not accommodate it. Therefore, the general management department and the international news department were moved to a new building near Blackfriars. At that time, the location felt quite spacious and had plenty of room for expansion. However, in less than a few years, the business increased day by day, and the old and new locations were no longer sufficient to meet its needs. Therefore, there was a proposal to build a new mansion, not only to merge the two offices into one, but also to include its British Empire and foreign communication agencies.</p>
<p>At the same time, the British Associated Press was also facing similar difficulties. Its current location at Byron House has become too crowded and insufficient for use. It had no choice but to move to a better location. The Associated Press was established 70 years ago. It initially used British Empire and foreign news from Reuters, so the relationship between the two parties was close and long-standing. Later, the relationship became even closer. Both parties' leaders adopted a policy of active cooperation without hindering their respective scopes of activities or losing their distinct personalities. Reuters is a British Empire and foreign news agency, while the Associated Press is the responsible general agency for domestic news gathering.</p>
<p>It was a natural result for the two parties to join hands to deal with the difficulty of finding premises. Therefore, they tried to purchase the land behind Byron House so that it would be connected to Byron House, reaching Salisbury Court from Fleet Street. At the same time, they hired architect Sir Edwin Lutyens to design and draw the plans. The purchase of the new land and the preparation of the drawings took nearly a year. Now, Byron House and its neighboring buildings are about to be demolished.</p>
<p>The new nine-story building faces the street on all four sides. The main entrance is located on Fleet Street. Inside, there will be the latest receiving and transmitting news equipment, as well as several inventions that have been studied for a long time. Reuters and the Associated Press will jointly operate and exchange news in the new building in the closest cooperation. This will allow the Associated Press to serve all British newspapers with high efficiency, and Reuters to serve the British Empire, Europe, the Far East, and other parts of the world with high efficiency.</p>
<p>British overseas communication agencies and foreign communication agencies related to Reuters will all have their London offices located in this new building. The continuous stream of domestic and foreign news received by Reuters and the Associated Press in 48 hours every day can be distributed to various offices at any time, so that news from all over the world can be transmitted quickly and spread around the world without delay.</p>
<p>In short, after the new building is completed, the system will be new, the working methods will be different from before, and a new era of world news cooperation and exchange will begin. (Reuters)</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Enter the Pass One After Another - Building a Large Airfield in Tianjin - Can Accommodate 70 Aircraft</h3>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: North of the Wan Guo Racecourse in Juzi, Dongju, Tianjin, there is a piece of open space belonging to the Beining Railway Bureau, about 700-800 mu. It is not known when it was investigated by the North China White Garrison Army. It intends to borrow it as a temporary airfield and expand it to the north, wanting to occupy 600 mu of land in Tianjin County. Initially, Major Dohyaku Mitsuo, a staff officer of the unit, went to see Chen Zhongyue, the magistrate of Tianjin County, and requested to borrow it, but Chen politely refused. Unexpectedly, on November 26, a team of about 60 soldiers from the Kwantung Army Air Force came from outside the pass. After getting off the train, they were sent to the aforementioned location, occupied it by force, and engaged in surveying. On the 27th, the Japanese army in Tianjin found more than 200 workers and transported rollers and other materials to start leveling. The Japanese surveyors occupied a part of the Wan Guo Racecourse building as a temporary garrison. Two mat sheds were built on the leveled ground for workers to rest. On the 28th and 29th, nearly one-third of the leveling was completed, and suddenly the nearby civilian land was occupied, expanding the ground to more than 3,000 mu. All the late rice planted in the farmland was removed. The workers were also increased by hundreds, speeding up the construction. Although there was heavy snow on the 30th, they still braved the wind and cold to level. The households whose land was occupied appealed to the Tianjin County Government, and the county magistrate forwarded it to the provincial government. Shang Zhen specially ordered Chen Dongsheng, the counselor of the provincial government's Tianjin office, to visit Tada, the commander of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin, and Kawagoe, the Japanese Consul General in Tianjin, to negotiate. Tada and Kawagoe said that it was a temporary loan and would be returned soon. However, after meeting twice, they could not get any results. Therefore, they can only let them build for the time being. According to military observers, the ground occupies more than 3,000 mu, and at least 50 aircraft can land at the same time. Adding the airfield built in front of the Balitai Okura Farm, if about 70 aircraft come to Tianjin, they can all be parked comfortably. Since the discovery of a fake people's movement in Tianjin on the 25th, Japanese aircraft have been flying over the city continuously from morning to night, or investigating the situation outside the city. Several aircraft were parked at the Balitai airfield, flying back and forth every day, picking up and dropping off senior Japanese military officers, which was very busy. The tense situation makes the people of Tianjin uneasy.</p>
<p>The North China Japanese Army stationed in Shanhaiguan and the Japanese Army in Tangshan Luanxian are all under the command of Tada. Since the 26th, they have successively opened up to Pingjin. The Beining East Section left behind is taken over by the newly arrived Japanese Kwantung Army. The North China Garrison Army totals more than 1,600 people. The Matsui Brigade, which opened up from Shanhaiguan, reached about 5,000 people. On November 29 and 30, soldiers from the Suzuki Brigade took 17 trains and opened up to Yuguan. Eight of these trains have stopped at Yuguan Station, and the other nine trains are currently stopped at the East Station in the former section outside the pass because there is no housing to live in inside the pass. They can open up into the pass in about one or two days. In the direction of Gubeikou, the Kawagishi Brigade has repeatedly increased, and a regiment has arrived. Xifengkou and Malanyu also have increases. The Japanese side plans to transfer a division and a brigade of the Kwantung Army into the pass and arrange them at various passes of the Great Wall within a week. Including the North China Garrison Army, the total number of soldiers reaches more than 18,000 people. Starting on the 30th, the Japanese army in Tianjin has been looking for houses near Ningyuan, which are suitable for stationing 3,000 people. They went to inspect the old rear defense hospital of the 51st Army, but they did not decide because the houses were broken and dilapidated. They are still looking for them. (1st) (Hai)</p>
<h3>Suzhou - Silver Industry Argues About Silver Fineness</h3>
<p>The Wuxian Gold and Silver Industry Association, in view of the report that the Ministry of Finance stipulates that the silver used by silver shops in silver ornaments must be 7 parts of copper, if implemented, will be very related to the credibility of the industry and will greatly affect the business. A meeting was held recently to discuss this issue. All members expressed dissatisfaction and decided to request the Ministry of Finance to provide relief to maintain the business and credibility, and to continue to use pure silver. It is heard that the Changshu County Gold and Silver Industry also has this view and has submitted it to the Ministry for relief, still using pure silver.</p>
<h3>Wuxi - Long Xin, the Magistrate of Longxin County, Will Come to Wuxi on Schedule</h3>
<p>Wuxi County Magistrate Wang Baoxuan resigned due to illness, which was approved by the provincial government. The vacancy was filled by the current Baoshan County Magistrate Long Tiyao. Magistrate Long turned over the seal in Baoshan on the 1st and is scheduled to come to Wuxi on the 6th. The important officials have been internally appointed. Secretary Zhu Rongsan, Chief of the First Section Xu Yingtu (from Nantong), Chief of the Second Section Huang Pei (from Hubei), and Chief of the Third Section Fang Guoding (from Yunnan) have all been preparing separately. Magistrate Wang is still in Shanghai due to illness and has asked Secretary Xia Dingwen to rush to handle the handover.</p>
<h3>Ningbo - Shenjiamen Will Have a Market</h3>
<p>The fishermen and merchants of Dinghai Shenjiamen, in view of the fact that the fisheries in Zhejiang Province have been declining year by year, believe that the reason is the reduction in production and the narrow sales channels. Therefore, they plan to set up a fish market in Shen in the short term. When it is realized in the future, it will be linked with the Shanghai Fish Market. The price of fish can be increased, which will not only benefit the fishermen greatly, but also give the fish industry a surplus and increase its external credit. It can also be used to borrow loans to help the fisheries, increase production, and be effective. It is a win-win situation.</p>
<h3>Nanchang Jiangxi Donation Supervision Committee Chairman Xu Suzhong Requests Resignation</h3>
<p>Xu Suzhong, Chairman of the Donation Supervision Committee of this province, recently telegraphed the Executive Yuan, saying, "To the esteemed Wang, President of the Nanjing Executive Yuan: I, Suzhong, am dull and have long abandoned hope of distinction. Unexpectedly, Your Excellency's esteemed Yuan mistakenly adopted undeserved praise and appointed me as a member of the Jiangxi Donation and Tax Supervision Committee. I was perplexed for months, fearing I would be unable to fulfill the task. Later, due to the earnest urging of the provincial government and the eager expectations of the people, I reluctantly heeded the loyal advice of my colleagues and jointly planned the establishment of the committee. Unexpectedly, I received excessive affection and was undeservedly granted the position of Chairman. The responsibility is great and the task heavy, making me feel even more inadequate. Since taking office, although relying on the cooperation of my colleagues, I have fortunately avoided failure. However, because I also hold the concurrent positions of President of the Shanghai Jiangxi Advanced Vocational School and Shanghai Jiangxi Middle School, I cannot reside at the committee permanently and devote myself to my duties. Reflecting on myself, I realize that I have made many mistakes. Recently, the Ministry of Education promulgated the Middle School Law and the Vocational School Law, both of which stipulate that school principals shall not hold concurrent positions. I should respectfully comply with these regulations to avoid dereliction of duty. I earnestly request Your Excellency to approve my resignation from the position of Jiangxi Donation and Tax Supervision Committee member so that I may dedicate myself to education and seek ways to repay your kindness in the future. This telegram expresses my eagerness to await your command." Xu Suzhong bows respectfully.</p>

<h3>The Moon Returns to Mother's Embrace (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yuzhe</p>
<p>From this, we can see that the Earth is indeed the Moon's mother. It is likely inevitable that there will be a feeling of separation from the distant horizon. Once the bright moon falls, it can be considered a wanderer returning home, which should slightly console the mother's longing gaze at the village entrance. Especially among the many satellites, the Moon is remarkably plump. If the Sun could enjoy the joy of having grandchildren, the Moon would surely be one of its most favored. Jupiter, the Sun's eldest son, weighs less than one-thousandth of his mother's weight. Jupiter has nine children surrounding his knees, and the weight of his largest child is only about one ten-thousandth of Jupiter's. The weight of the eldest child in Saturn's family is only one four-thousandth of Saturn's. However, our Moon weighs as much as one-eightieth of the Earth's weight, so it can naturally be considered an outstanding grandchild. Because the Moon has this particularly plump physique, we suspect that the "surgery" it underwent when it was born was slightly different from that of other satellites. According to the opinion of Darwin's great-grandson, the originator of the theory of evolution, the Moon was produced when the Earth had not yet solidified and was rotating very rapidly, coupled with the tidal effect of the Sun, and was split off from the Earth's body. At that time, the Earth was still a liquid, so it would be stirred up by the Sun into a towering peak. When the peak broke off, its upper end solidified into the Moon, which was already very far away from the Earth. However, compared to the current distance between the Moon and the Earth, it was only one-twenty-fourth.</p>
<p>So why did the Moon leave the Earth and run farther and farther away? Is it because it has a wandering nature? Upon investigation, the tides in the ocean cannot escape blame. The Earth is rotating, and the tides are always hindering it. Back then, the Earth could rotate once in just four hours. How agile that was! Now it takes twenty-four hours to rotate once. But waxing and waning are unavoidable phenomena in nature. As the Earth's rotation slowed down, the Moon's orbit around the Earth became more and more energetic. The Earth's control over the Moon had to be gradually relaxed, allowing it to go further and further away. However, when the time it takes for the Earth to rotate once is equal to the time it takes for the Moon to orbit the Earth once, then things will take a turn for the better. At that time, only one side of the Earth will be able to raise a glass to invite the bright moon, while the people on the other side will not even recognize the Moon. It is not yet known which hemisphere will have the good fortune of embracing the bright moon for eternity. Thinking carefully about this good fortune, although it is not a blank check, it will inevitably be greatly discounted in the future. Because the Moon is running farther and farther away, its clear radiance will surely be far less than it is now.</p>
<p>It is said that at that time, the duration of a day and night and a synodic month will be approximately equal to the current forty-seven days. From then on, the behavior of the tides will completely change its past mistakes. It will no longer be a drag on the Earth, but will help push the Earth to speed up its rotation. Then, according to the principle of waxing and waning (in scientific terms, it is called the conservation of angular momentum), the speed of the Moon's orbit will gradually slow down. Thus, this wanderer who has been away from home for a long time will have to gradually throw himself into the embrace of his loving mother. From the Moon's perspective, this action can be regarded as an expression of filial piety. People who advocate loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, harmony, and peace should encourage it. However, this stone ball, equivalent to thousands of towering mountains, falling from mid-air, the people in the world will either be crushed to death or shaken to death. I am afraid that even moralists will hardly be spared to convey people's approval to the Moon.</p>
<p>Fearing that someone will accuse me of starting with rumors and ending with rumors, I must quickly declare here that when the Moon is about to fall to the Earth, a savior will surely appear to erase this great calamity of mankind in one stroke. However, it is difficult to have both. Although this savior is a blessing to mankind, the Moon will inevitably suffer. Because the Earth also has the power of tidal forces on the Moon. Relying on its more robust physique, when the Moon is too close to it, the Earth's power can gradually tear the Moon apart, turning it into countless small moons, flying around the Earth, and no longer crashing down. If you don't believe this, please look up at Saturn. Is he as fortunate as Jupiter? He also has nine satellites orbiting him. However, closest to Saturn's side are not moons, but several extremely beautiful rings (the naked eye needs a telescope to see them). These rings are none other than examples of satellites that have been crushed to pieces. If our Moon is wise, it should know to take this as a warning. According to mathematical estimates, the Moon was born about 4 billion years ago. But from now until the bright moon returns to Earth's embrace, the age to be passed is more than just a fleeting moment of these 4 billion years. If we want to admire the grand spectacle of the future when many moons cover the sky, then we must follow in the footsteps of the Qin Emperor and pursue the method of immortality.</p>

<h3>Opera Star Yandong Returns to the Stage After Recovering from Asthma, Her Beauty is More Exquisite, and Her Nightingale-Like Voice Lingers Around the Beams</h3>
<p>At a singing competition in a certain city not far from Shanghai, there were more than a dozen opera stars. Among them, Yandong was the mainstay, because she had both a beautiful appearance and excellent singing skills. Unexpectedly, Yandong was careless in her daily life a while ago, which led to a cold. At first, her throat became inflamed, then she coughed slightly, and finally she developed asthma. As a result, she could not go on stage to sing clearly. The regulars of the club were very disappointed and did not go to the club to listen to the opera. As a result, the business plummeted. Later, Yandong sought medical treatment in Shanghai. The doctor advised her to take "Medical Lung Star" tablets, a British medicine for asthma sold by the China Merchant Xinhua Company Manager. The effect was indeed rapid and miraculous. Recently, her cough has completely stopped, her throat sound can be said to be completely restored, and her jade face is even more exquisite. The owner of the club heard this and asked her to repeat the performance. Yandong returned to the stage the other day and sang as usual. Her nightingale-like voice turned, and the lingering sound reverberated around the beams. The audience responded with enthusiastic applause for as long as three minutes. Yandong was encouraged by this and sang even more energetically. In recent days, the club has been so crowded that there is almost no room to stand.</p>
<p>"Medical Lung Star" tablets are specially designed to treat asthma and bronchitis cough. It is suitable for both the elderly and children. For detailed instructions, please write to China Merchant Xinhua Company, 367 Jiangxi Road, Shanghai. (Six)</p>

Fortunately, Comrade Wang soon recovered from his illness, and I was relieved of my responsibility. Unexpectedly, at the beginning of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, Comrade Wang was suddenly attacked, and I was entrusted to act again. At this time of crisis, I cannot decline for both public and private reasons. However, I, Xiangxi, am in charge of accounting and politics, and the responsibility is heavy and the task is complex. The operation and planning take up all my time. Fortunately, the First Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Committee has opened, and the central authorities are reorganized according to law. All positions of Vice President and Acting President of the Executive Yuan should be approved for resignation, and other capable people should be selected to take over.

<h3>Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau's Simple Life Insurance Officially Opened Yesterday, Over 300 Guests Arrived to Congratulate, Leaders from All Walks of Life Joined the Insurance</h3>
<p>The simple life insurance business of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau officially opened on December 2nd. From 10:00 AM, the Bureau's front was bustling with guests arriving in an endless stream. Those who went to congratulate from all walks of life included Sir Frederick Maze, Inspector General of Customs, Zheng Lai, Director of the Customs Administration, Lin Jinyu, Director of the Audit Office, Huang Boqiao, Director of the Two Roads Bureau, Xu Yuanfang, Director of the General Affairs Department, Bao Keyong, Director of the Telegraph Bureau, Xu Xueyu, Director of the Telephone Bureau, Wen Yuqing, Director of the Telecommunications Bureau, Wu Qiding, Director of the Tax Bureau. From the banking sector, there were Tang Shoumin, Chen Guangfu, Xu Xinliu, Zhu Ziliang, Lin Kanghou, Yang Yinsun, and from other sectors, there were Hu Yongqi, Mu Ouchu, Liang Chenlan, Liu Jingshan, Zhao Yuntai, Ding Xuenoong, Li Sihao, etc., as well as yesterday's Shanghai Postal Administration Director Pei Lin. They all arrived one after another. The Director of the Bureau, Shen Shuyu, the Deputy Directors, McLaren and Zhou Shouliang, accompanied them. The reception room was crowded and bustling, reaching a peak for a while. A total of about 300 guests came. Leaders from all walks of life who joined the insurance to promote it included Lin Kanghou, Chen Guangfu, Xu Xinliu, Song Ziliang, Mu Ouchu, Huang Boqiao, Wu Qiding, Ding Xuenoong, Liu Jingshan, Wang Zhixin, Hu Yongqi, Shen Yangyi, etc., as well as the Director of the Bureau, Shen Shuyu, the Deputy Director, Zhou Shouliang, and the Directors of various departments, secretaries, and Bureau members, dozens of people in all. There were also many outsiders who went to the Bureau to join the insurance. This national business is beneficial to society and has four characteristics: (1) Simple insurance procedures; (2) Low premiums; (3) No medical examination required; (4) People are sent to collect fees. As for the difference between simple life insurance and ordinary life insurance, ordinary life insurance calculates the premium based on the insured amount, while simple life insurance calculates the amount based on the premium, which is the opposite. It is hoped that people from all walks of life and the general public will work together to promote and join the insurance. Given the vastness of our country's territory and the large number of people, if it is promoted nationwide in the future, the results should not be difficult to surpass those of Europe, America, and Japan.</p>

The original letter is as follows: "Article 1 of the measures for implementing legal tender announced and implemented by the Ministry on the 4th of this month states, 'From November 4th of this year, the banknotes issued by the Central, China, and Transportation Banks will be designated as legal tender. All receipts and payments of food, taxes, and all public and private funds will be limited to legal tender. Cash cannot be used. Violators will have all of their money confiscated to prevent the smuggling of silver. If there is any intentional hoarding or concealment with the intention of smuggling, they should be punished in accordance with the Emergency Punishment Law for Harming the Republic of China,' etc. In addition, the Ministry formulated eight measures for exchanging legal tender, all of which were submitted to the Executive Yuan for submission to the National Government for compliance and announcement on file. Recently, confidential reports have repeatedly been received that in the Shanghai area, there are unscrupulous people who are privately buying silver coins and silver types at high prices, intending to smuggle and evade export, and with the approval of the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Public Security Bureau has reported that many cases have been seized and sent to the court for trial. These criminals, at this time of financial crisis and serious national crisis, dare to violate laws and regulations, engage in private gain, and disrupt social economy and endanger national survival. Your court is requested to severely punish them in accordance with the law to warn those who are treacherous and to provide for prevention. I hereby send this letter, and I hope that you will check it out."</p>
<p>Transfer of Association Affairs Separately</p>
<p>The Association's affairs are most focused on investigation and training. The investigation work has been transferred to the Business Section for takeover. The training work includes the establishment of a research class on practical problems in industry and commerce, which was originally co-organized with the Commercial Night School. The speakers are all experts, and the results are excellent. It is now completely taken over by the Night School. All personnel transferred from various departments have also returned to their original positions in their respective departments to work.</p>
<p>Expand the Business Committee</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that the members of the Revival Association are very enthusiastic about their past work, and all reforms in business in the future still need to rely on them. It has been decided to expand the organization of the Business Committee and add the original expert members of the Revival Association, Pan Xulun, Xu Yongzuo, Zhang Naiqi, Pan Yangyao, Li Wenjie, Xi Yushu, Yang Yinpu, Shou Yicheng, Cai Chengxin, He Qingru, Wang Xiaowen, and Xu Xiaochu, and 16 other people to the Business Committee in order to gather ideas and benefit from them.</p>
<p>Soliciting Opinions on Relief</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce, based on the letter from the Shipping Industry Association, believes that the depression of industry and commerce, taking advantage of the currency reform, is the only opportunity for economic revival. It should request the government to quickly implement the establishment of special banks and determine the minimum interest rate to avoid missing the opportunity. In addition to immediately submitting it to the Ministry of Finance, the Chamber of Commerce sent letters to various industries to solicit opinions for compilation and handling.</p>
<h3>Public Security Bureau Thoroughly Eliminates Opium; Opium Dens Within the Territory Must Close by a Deadline; Those Discovered After the Deadline Will Be Punished According to Military Law; Extensive Publicity Urges Opium Addicts to Repent</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Public Security Bureau began the mandatory registration of opium addicts, which will end at the end of this month, the bureau, determined to eliminate opium, began a second round of investigations yesterday. It is scheduled to conduct a joint land and water operation from the 5th, with strict investigations. All privately established opium dens within the territory must close by the end of the month. Those discovered after the deadline will be punished according to military law. Our reporter has learned the following details:</p>
<p>Strict Land and Water Operation</p>
<p>To complete the registration of opium addicts and thoroughly eliminate opium, the bureau began its second round of investigations yesterday. Starting the day after tomorrow (the 5th), the staff of the Opium Addict Registration Section of the bureau, together with police officers from various district offices and water patrol police, will be fully mobilized to conduct district-by-district investigations. Once discovered, offenders will be punished according to the promulgated regulations and ordered to register. Those unable to pay the fines will be sent to drug rehabilitation centers for compulsory treatment.</p>
<p>Opium Dens Within the Territory Must Close by a Deadline</p>
<p>The bureau has discovered that some unemployed people are privately running opium dens within the territory, providing opium for others to smoke, totaling no less than 2,000 establishments. At a time when opium prohibition is being strictly enforced, privately running opium dens is illegal. Considering their ignorance, police officers have been dispatched to advise them to close down by the end of this month. If any opium dens are discovered thereafter, the main offenders will be detained and handed over to the Garrison Headquarters for legal action. The landlords (or second landlords) will also be severely punished to achieve the goal of thorough elimination.</p>
<p>Extensive Publicity Urges Repentance</p>
<p>The Municipal Anti-Opium Committee and the Opium Addict Registration Section of the Public Security Bureau are conducting anti-opium work, starting with official propaganda to urge opium addicts to repent voluntarily. Therefore, in addition to sending staff from the Opium Addict Registration Section of the Public Security Bureau to conduct district-by-district propaganda, the Anti-Opium Committee is also using written propaganda, which has been quite effective. These two anti-opium agencies, realizing that the registration of opium addicts is about to end, are deeply concerned that some ignorant opium addicts are still waiting and seeing. Therefore, they have decided to jointly send staff to broadcast on various radio stations and screen anti-opium films within the next few days to urge opium addicts to repent and register as soon as possible during this period to avoid violating the law.</p>
<p>Punishment According to Military Law for Those Discovered After the Deadline</p>
<p>Our reporter interviewed Dai Lizhen, the director of the Opium Addict Registration Section of the Public Security Bureau, yesterday. According to him, the registration of opium addicts will end as scheduled at the end of this month and will not be extended. Starting on January 1st of next year, spot checks will be conducted on those who have quit opium to see if they still have opium addiction. Those found to still be addicted will be severely punished. As for opium addicts who are discovered without registration after the deadline, they will be detained and handed over to the Garrison Headquarters for legal action and will not be pardoned.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Instructs Banking Industry Yesterday to Accept Real Estate Mortgages According to Regulations; The Three Banks Are Instructed to Prepare for the Establishment of a Specialized Bank According to Regulations; and to Consult with the Central Bank to Expedite Rediscounting</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance yesterday instructed the two associations of the banking industry, stating that, according to a report from the Shanghai Cotton Yarn Industry Association, the end of the year is approaching, and business is in danger. They respectfully request a review and implementation of the current temporary relief measures. The case found that on November 4th of this year, your ministry issued a public announcement designating the banknotes of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications as legal tender, stating, "The above measures are an essential plan for economic revival and are not intended to use finance as a goal. The organization of the Central Bank will also strive to improve to fulfill the functions of a bank. The general banking system must be reformed and sound, and under stable conditions, methods should be found to increase its liquidity so that it can supply the needs of legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises with sufficient funds. Real estate mortgage loan banks will be added, and real estate mortgage laws will be revised to revitalize real estate." Your ministry also recognizes that today's financial institutions are insufficient to save the declining market and allow it to recover. Therefore, it indicates that after the implementation of the new currency policy, a new economic policy will be implemented at the same time to remedy the situation. After hearing this order, the industrial and commercial sectors eagerly await its realization and express their grievances and want to express their humble opinions. Today, under the centralized reserve system, the funds for the issuance sector cannot be used due to centralization, and the funds for the operating sector cannot be recovered due to stagnant accounts. Therefore, the currency in the market has a tightening phenomenon, making it more difficult for industrial and commercial sectors to circulate. In addition, real estate remains stagnant. The hundreds of millions of credit chips used in the past are almost worthless. Recently, the credit chips launched, such as acceptance bills, cannot be fully accepted and discounted by the financial industry because the rediscounting system has not been implemented, and the power of bill circulation is still limited. Shanghai, known as the first city in the country, has hundreds of millions of old chips that are ineffective, and new chips have not been born. How can the industrial and commercial sectors not fall into a state of exhaustion? Therefore, they dare to jointly express the crisis and urge implementation, and publicly elect Wen Lanting, Lao Jingxiu, Gu Xinyi, Ma Jiliang, Jin Runxiang, Ke Ganchen, Zhu Wenqi, Luo Qinghua, Zhou Bangjun, etc., to submit petitions, respectfully requesting review and approval, and instructing them to handle it separately, which is convenient. In addition to the difficulties mentioned, your ministry has already considered them and has repeatedly ordered them to maintain them for a year, and each settlement period has been safely passed. The recent implementation of the legal tender policy is an essential plan for economic revival. Since its implementation, finance has gradually become more active, and the market has turned around. Your ministry is also actively drafting and revising various financial laws and regulations to improve the banking and financial system and facilitate the development of enterprises, and has sent a letter to the Central Bank to recruit commercial shares according to law and reorganize to fulfill the responsibilities of the bank. Real estate mortgage banks are also actively being prepared, and in order to activate land credit, a petition has been submitted to the Executive Yuan to transfer and discuss with the Legislative and Judicial Yuans to revise real estate mortgage laws and land and factory bases, which can facilitate mortgage loans. At the same time, it has also consulted with the Central Bank to expedite the rediscounting of bills to facilitate the circulation of funds, which is in line with the meaning of the association to activate old chips and circulate new chips. Those who request the transfer of land deeds for mortgages should be done as much as possible, which is inconsistent with the regulations of the Three Banks. It has been instructed to prepare for the establishment of a real estate mortgage loan bank by the deadline to meet the needs. As for the order to instruct all banks to accept mortgages of factory bases and factory properties, it has been transferred to the banking industry association to inform all banks. It is urgently ordered that the association be informed and that all members of the industry be notified that they should handle the requests for mortgages of factory bases and factory properties from manufacturers in accordance with the regulations, which is most important. This order.</p>
<h3>Joint Association for Rent Reduction in Various Districts Sends Letter to Real Estate Association; Urges Consideration of the Livelihood of the Poor in the City and Voluntary Rent Reduction; Two Rent Reduction Committees Hold Meetings Separately Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, since the rent reduction movement occurred in this city, although some landlords have voluntarily reduced rents, they are still a minority. The rent reduction associations in various districts sent another letter to the Real Estate Association yesterday, warning them to consider the social market and the livelihood of the poor and to promptly order members to voluntarily reduce rents. The original letter and the progress of various parties are recorded below:</p>
<p>District Associations Warn Landlords</p>
<p>The rent reduction associations in various districts of the city sent a letter to the Real Estate Association yesterday, stating, "Dear Sirs, Shanghai has been affected by the economic downturn, all industries are in decline, prices have fallen sharply, and finance has lost its circulation, but rents remain high, making it difficult for the general public to bear this heavy burden. Therefore, they request that landlords in various places appropriately reduce rents to provide relief. We have organized a Rent Reduction Committee to reduce the burden on citizens and restore the market and save it from danger. We use righteous words to promote the awareness of landlords, so that they know the original intention of coexistence and common prosperity. In the past two years, although there have been landlords who are aware of the righteousness and consider the social environment and voluntarily or passively reduce rents, there are also many landlords who are blinded by profit and only know how to profit without knowing the overall situation. After careful investigation by our association, we have learned that the landlords who voluntarily reduce rents are all individual in nature and are not members of your association. Our association is suspicious of this. At this time, Shanghai, which has survived the disaster, is further affected by the economic tide of the world, resulting in the collapse of industry and commerce and the decline of the market. We should jointly come together to rescue the market. Your association should be aware of this. Now, the member landlords of your association not only do not know the overall situation and put the rescue of the market behind their minds, but even after repeated earnest requests from tenants, they still refuse to listen and even use economic power to enforce the law, disregarding human feelings, and often file lawsuits to oppress poor tenants, disregarding coexistence and common prosperity. This is truly a loss of reason due to greed and is regrettable. We believe that your association, as the leader of the real estate industry, should have the obligation to restrain member landlords to alleviate the people's difficulties. Now, rent reduction lawsuits are heard every day, and the poor are unbearable. In order to prevent unexpected events, the strong take risks, and the weak commit suicide. Your association disregards the social environment and allows member landlords to disobey public opinion. Our association hopes that your association will quickly realize this, consider the overall situation, and promptly order your members to voluntarily reduce rents, so as to reduce the burden on citizens and help restore the market. Then the tenants will be fortunate, and society will be fortunate."</p>

<h3>A Gale Suddenly Occurred on the Sea; Both North and South Ocean Liners Were Affected; According to Reports from All Parties; Fortunately, No Danger Occurred</h3>
<p>Since the night before last, the weather has been unusually cold, and the tide in the Huangpu River in Shanghai has also risen. The Sichuan Road and Guangdong Road area has been flooded with tide water from the sewers for several days. At the same time, a gale occurred on the sea, hindering merchant ships. The situation is described as follows:</p>
<p>Taishun</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's Taishun ship loaded cargo and passengers on the night of November 30th and set sail for Yantai and Tianjin. On the 1st of this month, the ship went out of the Wusongkou, and at first there was nothing wrong. Then a gale occurred on the sea. The captain of the Taishun ship, considering the excessive wind and waves and the danger of navigation, chose a sheltered place near ShilanSland to anchor and stop navigation to wait for the weather to change. Yesterday, the captain telegraphed Shanghai to report that he would set sail as soon as the wind and waves subsided.</p>
<p>Haixiang</p>
<p>The Haixiang ship is sailing to Laoyao. The captain of the ship telegraphed Shanghai yesterday, saying that when the ship reached the sea area between 122 degrees 24 minutes east longitude and 32 degrees 32 minutes north latitude, there was a sudden gale on the sea, which was very fierce. Our ship still struggled forward, and the speed was greatly reduced. After a long battle, it telegraphed yesterday that it had escaped danger. At the same time, there were many ships that encountered the wind on the sea and anchored to avoid it.</p>
<p>Gongping</p>
<p>Another Gongping ship was sailing from Qingdao back to Shanghai and was scheduled to enter the port yesterday morning and load cargo today. The ship reported that when it reached the sea area of 123 degrees 29 minutes east longitude and 29 degrees 38 minutes north latitude, the gale came and struck. The gale was so strong and the range of the wind was so large that the Gongping ship had no time to stop and avoid it, so it sailed against the wind and went through the danger of turbulent waves. Yesterday afternoon, it telegraphed that it had escaped danger and was heading to Shanghai. There was also the Nanhua liner Haiyuan, which sailed from Shantou and also encountered a gale on the way. Many of the north-south ocean liners of Taikoo and Jardine encountered wind and waves on the sea route in the past two days, but they were all reported to be safe. Now the wind has blown elsewhere, and the ships can arrive in Shanghai one after another.</p>
<h3>Vegetable Vendors on Kangti Road Temporarily Allowed to Set Up Stalls by the French Municipal Council; Seeking Relief Before the Construction of the Vegetable Market</h3>
<p>The vegetable stalls on Kangti Road in the French Concession of this port have been banned by the French Concession authorities for several months and have not been restored. Because of the interruption of their livelihoods, the stallholders have repeatedly sent representatives to the party and government organs of this city and Mr. Lu Bohong, a Chinese director of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the French Concession, to petition and request negotiations for restoration. However, the French authorities are planning to build a vegetable market and are unable to allow stalls to be set up on Kangti Road. Therefore, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the French Concession sent a letter to the vegetable vendor representatives a few days ago, and the stallholders were extremely panicked. Yesterday, they sent representatives Zhou Wenxian and others to petition Mr. Lu, a Chinese director, again, requesting relief. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Petition Situation</p>
<p>Yesterday at around 10 am, the stallholders publicly elected representatives Zhou Wenxian, Yue Yigui, Zuo Henghe, etc., three people, carrying a petition to the Huashang Tram Company in Nanshi to petition Mr. Lu Bohong. Mr. Lu personally received them and received the petition and stated the difficult situation of the stallholders' lives and requested that the French authorities be negotiated for relief. Mr. Lu immediately telephoned the French Municipal Council and negotiated with Director Wei Zhiren. The council agreed to temporarily allow the establishment of stalls before the construction of the vegetable market to provide relief. The representatives of the stallholders were satisfied and left.</p>
<p>Petition</p>
<p>The petition submitted by the representatives of the stallholders, Wenxian, etc., yesterday is recorded as follows: Dear Sir, Regarding the case of the French Concession authorities banning stalls on Kangti Road, the stallholders have repeatedly petitioned you to uphold justice and asked you to negotiate. We are grateful for your approval and asked the French Municipal Council to find a way to handle it so as to maintain our livelihood. However, it has been several months, and there is still no news of restoring the stalls. The stallholders and their families have been in extreme panic due to the interruption of their livelihoods, and some have even gone on hunger strike and are waiting to die. The miserable situation is understood by you. Now it is the end of the year and the cold season, and the lives of the poor are even more difficult. The stallholders feel that a great disaster is imminent. If there is no hope of setting up stalls, they will all become starving corpses. At that time, it will affect society and be related to security, which will be serious and great. You are charitable and generous and are admired by the world. You will definitely grant relief to the poor vendors. Therefore, we publicly elect representatives to express our suffering and beg you to negotiate with the French Council again to temporarily allow the establishment of stalls on the road. As soon as the construction of the vegetable market is completed, we will move in to avoid starvation. We are impatiently awaiting your orders.</p>

(4) Water meters, such as those installed in exposed positions, and their upper and lower water pipes, should be kept warm with straw or other materials to avoid freezing. As for the water consumption due to freezing or any other reason, the water fee recorded by the water meter shall be paid in full. The company is very willing to help users protect water pipes and other equipment, but only to the extent that the water pipes are not affected.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Notice: Overseas Chinese Entering Villages for Reclamation, Qualification Will Be Cancelled if They Fail to Arrive Within One Month</h3>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, overseas Chinese expelled in recent years have arrived in Shanghai in batches. Due to livelihood difficulties, their situation is extremely miserable. Gentlemen such as Xu Jizhuang have petitioned the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission for permission to send overseas Chinese to Qiaole Village, Anhui, for reclamation in batches. More than 100 people have already gone. Some overseas Chinese, including Chen Xialian, who have not yet entered the village, received a notice yesterday from the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. Chen Zhenglian, Lin Yuzhai, Zou Deming, Yang Shunrui, Zheng Liubao, Zheng Mengying, Lin Riyin, Xu Shanggu, Zhou Deming, Pan Hongguang, Wang Zhouxing, Ye Yandi, Chen Chonggeng, Wu Dengyun, and others are required to enter the village within a limited time. The notice stated: "It has been found that the overseas Chinese previously applied voluntarily to enter Qiaole Village for reclamation. After review and approval, permits were issued allowing them to enter the village for reclamation. However, it has been eight months and the overseas Chinese have not reported to the village. According to the first phase of the reclamation outline, the number of recruited reclaimers is limited to 200. After receiving the permits, the overseas Chinese hesitated and waited for a long time without going to the village. Their qualifications as reclaimers should be cancelled immediately. However, out of consideration for the overseas Chinese, an extension of one month is granted, until December 31 of this year. If they still fail to arrive beyond the deadline, it will be considered their own fault, and their reclaimer slots will be filled by others. As for the travel documents submitted by the overseas Chinese and the receipts and permits issued by the former Relief Committee, they must be returned within the deadline for collection. Once the deadline has passed, this Commission will not be able to keep them for the overseas Chinese for a long time. This notice is hereby issued."</p>

<h3>Landlady Accuses Elementary School Teacher of Seducing and Raping Her, and Instigating the Murder of Her Husband. Liu Chenshi Comes to Shanghai to Seek Justice and Encounters Song Pinshan by Chance. The Previous Causes and Effects are Like a Miniature "Imperial Girl," Each Party Holding Different Accounts.</h3>
<p>Liu Chenshi, also known as Chen Chengzhen, a woman from Suzhou, is 35 years old. She is the stepmother of Liu Xiangtai, a 51-year-old native of Haimen and the owner of the Liu'an Hotel in Haimen Guild Hall Street, Jiangsu. They have been married for more than ten years and have a daughter named Lanying, who is 16 years old. Recently, Chenshi filed a lawsuit with the Haimen County Government against Song Pinshan (also known as Song Jinrong, Song Haojiang, Jingneng, etc.), the young owner of Song Hengfeng Distillery on Haimen Main Street (29 years old this year), accusing him of seduction and rape, instigating murder, and fraud. When Song heard of the accusation, he fled to Shanghai and hid at No. 525, Xiude New Village, Chengdu Road, Public Concession, and served as the Director of Teaching Affairs at Jixian Elementary School, No. 30, Lane 62, Ganshi East Road, French Concession. After the Haimen County Government learned of this, it sent a letter to the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court requesting assistance in arresting him. However, because Song was well-informed and hid, he was not captured. Recently, Liu Chenshi came to Shanghai to seek justice. On the afternoon of the 29th of last month, Chenshi happened to meet Song on Xinzha Road. She grabbed Song and reported him to the police for investigation. Yesterday, the Law Enforcement Department escorted Song to the Criminal Court 1 of the Second Special District Court, where Judge Zhang Chaozuo interrogated him. Fei Xizhen, the lawyer representing the Law Enforcement Department, stated the case and claimed that the defendant had committed crimes under Article 240 and Article 339 of the Criminal Law, and filed a lawsuit against the defendant according to law, requesting a trial. The plaintiff, Liu Chenshi, testified that she met the defendant in September of the 22nd year of the Republic of China because he often came to her shop. In November of that year, a guest named Sun Huimin committed suicide due to unrequited love. The defendant helped her submit the report to the government so that the matter could be resolved. From then on, the defendant further flattered and seduced her. In December of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, her husband came to Shanghai to buy New Year's goods. The defendant broke into her bedroom the night before her husband left, molested her, and threatened her, saying that if she did not agree to him, he would follow Sun Huimin's example and commit suicide in her room. So she obeyed his adultery. Not long after, she went to the Wujiazhen Temple to seek a fairy prescription, and the defendant followed her. He told her that he and she should each make a contract promising to be together forever. After her husband died, they could live together until old age, and he said that he would never change his mind. At that time, she did not agree until January of the 23rd year of the Republic of China that she agreed to sign. In March of the previous year, the woman and her daughter went to Suzhou for medical treatment, and Song also followed them to Suzhou and stayed for several nights and took photos together. Later, the woman went to Shanghai and lived with her eldest daughter, Meiying, on Huanlong Road (Meiying was born to her husband's ex-wife and married Deng Fu, a native of Hubei and the former commander of the 13th Division, also known as Deng Jianhao). At that time, Song did not follow her. In April, the woman returned to Haimen, but heard that Song had fled to Shanghai because of something. However, he often wrote letters. In May, her daughter Lanying returned to Haimen from Shanghai. From then on, all the letters were opened and read by Lanying. In July, Song returned to Haimen and borrowed 300 yuan from her, falsely claiming that he wanted to go to Fujian to find a job. She lent him 250 yuan. Later, in October, he came again, falsely claiming that he was not used to living in Fujian, and then gave her a bottle of poison, instructing her to murder her husband. At that time, she did not agree and threw away the bottle. Then he borrowed 200 yuan from her, claiming to go to Beiping to find a job. He left Haimen at the end of October and returned in December. He came to Haimen and borrowed 500 yuan to open Jixian School in Shanghai. Because the woman had no cash, she gave him gold jewelry worth 800 yuan. In the first month of the lunar year this year, he came to Shanghai and wrote to seduce her daughter Lanying to come to Shanghai. The two lived together at No. 6, Tongfuli, Julai Road. Later, her husband came to Shanghai to look for her but could not find her. Her daughter Lanying was delayed at her brother-in-law Deng Jianhao's house last year and was seduced by Deng into committing adultery and became pregnant. She returned to her home in Haimen to give birth. In March of this year, the defendant Song Pinshan instigated Lanying to file a complaint in the Criminal Court of your court accusing Deng Jianhao of rape. When Deng heard the complaint, he fled to the East Asia Hotel in the British Concession. Later, Song Pinshan, together with Gao Yubao and Wu Sibao, extorted money from Deng, resulting in Deng entrusting someone to mediate and spending 8,000 yuan to settle the matter as compensation for Lanying's loss. In June of this year, Song Pinshan returned home. The woman asked him to return the borrowed money and jewelry, but he ignored her and fled to Shanghai with his wife. The woman had no choice but to sue the Haimen County Government. Yesterday, she sent a telegram to the Haimen County Government requesting them to send someone to Shanghai to escort the defendant. Someone will come to pick him up soon, etc. When questioned, the defendant Lai Pinshan confessed that he was 29 years old, from Wuyuan, Anhui, and had graduated from Haimen Middle School. He also opened Song Hengfeng Distillery in Haimen and worked as a reporter for the Shanghai Review, submitting articles to various newspapers. He had worked as the Director of Teaching Affairs at Jixian School run by Cai Xianping on Ganshi East Road. He resigned because of disagreements. He had also worked as a reporter for a newspaper in Haimen. Because of news interviews, he often played in the plaintiff's hotel. In November of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, a guest committed suicide in the plaintiff's hotel. The plaintiff and his wife asked him to write a report and submit it to the county government, requesting exemption from inspection. The report was approved. At that time, Chenshi was extremely grateful. Chenshi was born as a prostitute. Because she disliked her husband for being old and incompetent, and admired the talent of young civilians, she flattered him in every way, giving him rewards under the pretext of giving him rewards. They often came and went. But she was born as a prostitute with special charming skills. She said that her husband was old and weak, and if he died one day, no one would take care of her. So no matter what, she wanted him to succeed her. People are not made of stone, and civilians are young and have little knowledge, so a relationship developed. He never gave her poison to kill her husband, nor did he defraud her, nor did he seduce her daughter and extort money from the Deng family. Moreover, her husband, Liu Xiangtai, once sued the civilian in the Shanghai Local Court for abducting his daughter, and the court ruled that it would not be accepted. There is a case to check. He asked for a clear investigation, etc. The court verified the confession and then discussed whether the case should be transferred to the Haimen County Government for trial. The documents will be reviewed before verification, and the hearing will be adjourned to the morning of the 6th. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Schedule to Cancel Chinese Language Allowance Totaling 250,000 Yuan Annually</h3>
<p>Foreign employees of the Public Works Department, including Japanese and Indian staff of the Police Department, are given a monthly allowance for learning Chinese, ranging from several taels to dozens of taels. In addition, there are lump-sum bonuses for passing the Chinese language proficiency test. These two expenses are quite considerable, amounting to 250,000 yuan annually based on the current total amount. The police department accounts for two-thirds of the total. Recently, the authorities, in order to reduce expenses, have issued a notice to their subordinates, indicating their intention to cancel it. The lump-sum bonus for passing the exam will also be changed to prizes or medals in the future, and the level of the exam will be raised. Those with excellent results will be given prizes and medals, and it will not be enough to just pass. These measures will be gradually implemented among Japanese and Indian police officers. However, in view of the impact on the interests of lower-level employees, the implementation of the entire plan will be postponed for five years. In addition, long-term employees of the Public Works Department and the police department whose appointments were before 1931 have been entitled to child allowance. This allowance has also been decided to be cancelled at the end of this year. However, the above-mentioned Chinese language allowance does not conflict with the original regulations of the Public Works Department, which stipulate mandatory Chinese language learning, and will not be changed. Because in certain positions, the degree of proficiency in Chinese is an important criterion for promotion. It is reported that the above-mentioned proposal for change was first drafted by the Director of the Finance Department of the Public Works Department, submitted to the Personnel Committee for review, and then submitted to the Board of Directors for approval and implementation.</p>
<h3>Fraud Case of Fictitious Company Names The Case is Complex and Awaiting Investigation. The Police Request a Special Hearing. Those Unrelated Were Released Yesterday.</h3>
<p>Yuxingyong Company at No. 10, Weishui Lane, Ningbo Road, Shunchang Company at No. 30, Pintang Lane, Shanxi Road, Yusheng Money Shop at No. 40, Renmei Lane, Ningbo Road, and Yuchanglong Company at No. 10, Xinkang Lane, Wuchang Road, are organizations specializing in defrauding others of their property. Many people have been deceived. The case has been cracked by the Lao Zha General Patrol Chengdu Road and other police stations. The main offenders and accomplices, Chen Guorui, Li Yongnian, Lou Jirong, Bao Futong, Gu Bingrui, Xue Shixiong, Xu Zhiqing, Chen Chusheng, Zhou Yimei, Pan Wusan, Zhang Caitai, Ge Ahai, Shen Yunfeng, Tong Wenzhang, Ma Tianji, Rong Wangyun, Wang Yaoliang, and 17 others have been arrested and escorted to the First Special District Court for interrogation and custody. This has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the case was continued to be heard. Qian Hongye, the Chief Judge of the Criminal Court, opened the Criminal Court 1 for interrogation. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated that because the police had been arresting the criminals last week, they had not yet begun to investigate the facts of the crime. Therefore, he asked the court to postpone the hearing again and requested a special hearing because the case was a little complicated. However, Bao Futong among the defendants was found by the police to be unrelated to the case. Therefore, he was asked to be released and stopped from being detained. Judge Qian approved the report and ordered the case to be adjourned for hearing. Bao Futong was released.</p>
<h3>After the Death of Female Professor Zhang Duanzhen, the Estate Dispute Has Not Ended. She Suffered Unfair Treatment During Her Lifetime. Wang Wenyu Knows the Most Details.</h3>
<p>Zhang Duanzhen, a woman from Minhou, was well-versed in both Chinese and Western learning and had served as a professor at various universities. Unfortunately, she died of illness on July 26 of this year. During her lifetime, she strived to encourage herself, studied tirelessly, and accumulated assets of more than 10,000 yuan. On her deathbed, because she had many sisters, she made a will in advance, stating that in case of any misfortune, all her estate would be managed entirely by her brother, Zhang Xifan. Later, Ms. Zhang died of illness. Zhang Xifan, fearing opposition from others, hired lawyer Cheng Xiuling to file a lawsuit with the Local Court against his elder sisters, Zhang Meizhen, Lin Zhang Shuzhen, Li Zhang Wanzhen, and others, seeking confirmation of the will. The defendants, Zhang Meizhen and others, hired lawyer Suan Yaoxian to file a defense. After receiving the report, the court held several hearings and considered it necessary to summon witnesses. Therefore, it was not concluded. This has been reported in previous newspapers. At 11:00 AM yesterday, Chief Judge Pang Shurong specially opened the First Court for trial. The plaintiffs and defendants, each accompanied by a lawyer, arrived in court one after another. Chief Judge Pang briefly questioned both parties. The defendant's lawyer stated that the defendant, in addition to the defense, also filed a counterclaim, alleging that the plaintiff forged the will and should be deprived of the right to inherit the estate according to law. According to the testimony of the witness, Ms. Lin Chen Shuduan, 47 years old, from Fuzhou, who is a relative of both the plaintiff and the defendant and was also a classmate, when asked whether Zhang Duanzhen made a will before her death, she replied, "Yes, and there were four of us present." Then the plaintiff's lawyer stated that the defendant, Zhang Meizhen, had recently written a letter to Ms. Wang Wenyu and the witness Lin Chen Shuduan, who is present in court, and asked the court to question them. Chief Judge Pang questioned Lin Chen Shuduan accordingly. She replied, "Zhang Meizhen wrote a letter to me, instructing me on how to testify in court and asked me to sign. I didn't think it was right and refused to sign. So this original letter was returned by my cousin Chen." At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that Ms. Wang Wenyu is currently a teacher at Jinghai Women's School in Suzhou and knows the details of how Zhang Duanzhen was driven out and treated by the defendants during her lifetime. Zhang Xifan submitted a notebook written by Bao Guobiao as supporting evidence for the will, which contained all the facts of Zhang Duanzhen's life. Chief Judge Pang examined it and ordered Bao Guoliang to testify in court. He said that he was from Zhejiang and the defendants were his wife's aunts. His wife's father was the defendants' brother. The notes he wrote were records of the deceased's oral accounts and were responsible proof. He said, "I am here today to speak the truth. I may offend my aunts." Chief Judge Pang then ordered Wang Wenyu and others to be summoned to court for further trial. Then the court adjourned.</p>

The second landlord, Ms. Yang Mao, testified that the defendant repeatedly used rattan sticks to beat her daughter and even forcibly inserted the object into the girl's genitals. She said that she had repeatedly advised her, but she did not listen. Such abuse was truly unbearable to witness.

<h3>36th Meeting of the Shanghai City Aviation Association Headquarters Discusses Revising Collection Methods for Aviation Donations from Dance Halls</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Solicitation Team Headquarters of the China Aviation Association held its 36th office meeting at its office at 2:00 PM on the 30th of last month to discuss the overall direction of solicitation and fundraising. Those present included Chief Executive Li Dachao, Secretaries Zhang Yuliang, Zhou Songhe, Chen Shuo, Li Jimin, Liu Songtao, Song Zheng, Zhu Shengyang, Lu Zhangyan, Gu Shangrui, Zhang Xiamin, Wei Jianxin, Bao Lengxue, Yang Xinwen, Li Huiran, etc. Chairman Li Dachao and Recorder Chen Shuo. Chairman Li reported briefly that since the office sent a circular to each solicitation team asking them to step up their efforts, the team leaders, deputy team leaders, and team members have worked very hard. In recent days, the results reported and paid have been extremely crowded. Field secretaries should do their best to assist in promoting and complete the dance hall industry in stages, collecting donations for national aviation salvation. A trial run began in August, with part of the collection being handled by the dance halls and the rest by the office's collectors. The results were excellent. For convenience, it was decided to entrust each dance hall to collect it when opening the bill. For dance halls with less than six tickets per yuan, one corner of ocean is collected per guest, and for those with more than six tickets, five cents of ocean is collected per guest. Since the dance guests are enjoying themselves, they should not care about this small amount. Collecting small contributions will help the great cause of national aviation salvation. It is hoped that the principals of each dance hall are enthusiastic patriots and will always be able to do their best to assist. The collection method has been approved by the municipal government for filing and a notice has been issued, which will be distributed to each venue for posting and will be implemented immediately. The collection of aviation rescue donations from the hotel industry has been handled diligently by the industry. People from all walks of life have generously donated, and the results have been excellent. It is hoped that the donations in October will be more than in September. It is hoped that each secretary responsible for careful investigation should promote it in a practical manner so that the results can be greatly improved and the mission of the hotel industry's aircraft can be completed as soon as possible. The results of the collection of donations from the brick and tile industry, sand and gravel industry, freight car industry, and private shipping industry have been excellent. After each field secretary reported on the situation of contact and inspection, a number of solicitation and fundraising plans were discussed and the meeting was adjourned at 4:25 PM.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Stipulates Measures for Investigating Violations of Stamp Tax in Other Provinces, to be Handled Separately by the Competent Authorities of Those Provinces</h3>
<p>The personnel sent by the Ministry of Finance to supervise and inspect stamp tax in various provinces and cities have already begun their work separately. It has been learned that when performing their duties, the inspectors often discover cases of violations of the stamp tax law in other provinces or counties, so they have presented petitions to the Ministry asking how to handle them.

Therefore, 2,000 sets were allocated to discuss the distribution with the responsible personnel of the office. (2) Vice President Wan Binlai wrote that Heze has no shelter, so the victims are crying for hunger and cold and have nowhere to go. They can only be temporarily housed in the hospital run by our office, but there are no cotton clothes. Please allocate relief clothes to avoid freezing and starvation. Therefore, 400 sets of relief clothes were allocated, and Mr. Wan distributed them locally. (3) The victims from Jinan are coming one after another, and the relief clothes are not enough to distribute. Therefore, 480 sets were allocated to the newly arrived victims without clothes. (4) The First and Second Hospitals run by our office have also established a pharmacy in Zhangqiu. There are extremely miserable victims without clothes who are sick and hospitalized for treatment.

<h3>Austrian Professor Lectures on the Mysteries of Chinese Characters</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Yesterday afternoon at 5:30 PM, at the International Theatre Association on the fourth floor of the Young Women's Christian Association at No. 55 Yuanmingyuan Road, the "Old Shanghai Exhibition," which began on the 26th of last month, invited Austrian national Mr. Leifler (Chinese name Luo Yimin) to lecture on "The Mysteries of Chinese Characters." Mr. Luo, aged 33, holds a PhD in Political Economy from the University of Vienna in Austria. Sixteen years ago, while at the University of Vienna, he studied Chinese with Luo Shide, a former Austrian envoy to China. He came to China in 1932 and is currently a German professor at Wentong University. Mr. Luo speaks fluent Chinese and is proficient in Chinese writing. He said that studying Chinese is not a difficult task. Although the Kangxi Dictionary contains more than 40,000 characters, only 3,000 to 4,000 characters are actually used. He then listed several characters such as "river" (河), "jiang" (江), and "brush" (筆) on the blackboard and explained their origins and meanings in detail, giving a lecture that lasted for more than an hour. Most of the attendees were female members of the association, about 50 people in total, and they were all very interested. It is said that a Westerner will be hosting a "fortune-telling session" on the afternoon of the 5th (the day after tomorrow) at 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Owners Overcharging Fares: Reasons for Committee Penalties</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Rickshaw Affairs Committee, in view of the numerous cases of rickshaw owners overcharging fares, has had no choice but to take measures to stop this practice. Therefore, any rickshaw owner or contractor who violates the license regulations and overcharges fares will be subject to suspension of license issuance upon verification. Some of the rickshaw owners petitioned the trade association, which then sent a letter to the Rickshaw Affairs Committee days ago, requesting that it withdraw its order and be lenient, alleging that the Committee had listened to inaccurate reports from a few rickshaw pullers and arbitrarily punished the owners. The Chairman of the Rickshaw Affairs Committee issued a statement yesterday regarding this matter, strongly refuting the accusation that the Committee arbitrarily punishes without thorough investigation. He said that the Committee makes every effort to investigate after receiving a report, and before taking action, gives the rickshaw owner the opportunity to hear the evidence presented by the puller. In most cases, the contractor also admits to the offense. Therefore, the Committee never arbitrarily punishes rickshaw owners without solid evidence. Furthermore, the Committee believes that it is regrettable that some rickshaw owners have no sense of responsibility to abide by the conditions of license issuance. Although there are some sensible rickshaw owners who have done their best to advise their contractors to make every effort to maintain order, the Committee, in view of the limited effectiveness of their advice, feels that it has no choice but to exercise its disciplinary powers. However, the Committee believes that the financial burden of being penalized should be borne by those rickshaw owners who violate the regulations. The purpose of the penalties is to prevent overcharging of fares. Therefore, it hopes that people in the rickshaw trade association can consider the hardships of the rickshaw pullers and sincerely cooperate in this matter. In addition, the Hongkou Rickshaw Puller Licensing Office has now closed. From now on, all matters will be handled by the New Zhapu/Shunde Road Public Works Department district licensing office. Furthermore, owners of private rickshaws whose pullers' licenses expired at the end of September are also requested to have their pullers renew their licenses as soon as possible, as new regulations will soon be enforced, and anyone without a current arm badge will not be allowed to operate.</p>

<h3>Li Zhentai Arrested for Smoking Opium: Fellow Villager Takes Advantage to Defraud, Sends Letter to Father-in-Law Claiming Arrest for Theft, 500 Yuan Remittance Embezzled</h3>
<p>Li Zhenqin, a Shandong native, 52 years old, residing at No. 44, Nanyongjili, Wangzhi Road, French Concession, who runs a pharmacy, was arrested on August 16th for smoking opium, handed over to the court for prosecution, and sentenced to a fine of 20 yuan and one month of mandatory detoxification. However, Li Benzheng, a fellow villager, 40 years old, who previously resided upstairs at the Shanji Barber Shop, No. 140 Beidili Road, French Concession, and now resides at No. 2, Zhenqingli, New Guangdong Street, Chuan Highway, Hongkou, falsely used the name of Li Zhenqin's wife, née Li Yuan, and sent a letter to Yuan Guoshan, Li Zhentai's father-in-law in Shandong, stating that his son-in-law had been detained in Shanghai for theft and needed 500 yuan to be sent abroad in order to find a way to avoid punishment, that he was unable to raise the money in Shanghai, and therefore wrote to borrow the money immediately. Upon receiving the letter, Yuan Guoshan, knowing that something had happened to his son-in-law in Shanghai and concerned about family ties, immediately gathered the full amount of 500 yuan and entrusted the Shandong Zhuqiao Telegraph Bureau to remit it to the Tianhexing Remittance Agency on Tiantang Street, Aiduya Road, French Concession, Shanghai. After receiving the reply telegram from Yuan Guoshan of Shandong, Li Benzheng immediately carved a seal in the name of Li Zhentai and, with the guarantor of the owner of the Shanji Barber Shop at No. 140 Beidili Road, where he originally resided, fraudulently withdrew the money from the Tianhexing Remittance Agency and embezzled it. Later, after Li Zhentai completed his one-month opium detoxification period, paid the fine, and was released from prison, he returned home and immediately went to his hometown in Shandong to meet his father-in-law, Yuan Guoshan, and learned that someone had taken the opportunity to impersonate him and commit fraud. He immediately came to Shanghai, investigated the person who withdrew the money from Tianhexing Remittance Agency, and learned that it was guaranteed by the Shanji Barber Shop, knowing that it was Li Benzheng who had done it. When he went to look for Li Benzheng, he had already moved away. He immediately reported the information to the French Police and requested an arrest. Detective Li Liansheng and Bao Detective Yu Wenzhi investigated and learned that Li Benzheng had moved to No. 2, Zhenqingli, Chuan Highway. They went to arrest him together with the local police, but Li was not at home. On the 30th of last month at noon, Li Benzheng happened to be passing by Beiler Road in the French Concession, and was encountered by Detective Li and Detective Yu, who immediately arrested him and took him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was handed over to the Criminal Division 1 of the Special District 2 Court, presided over by Judge Zhang Chaozuo. Attorney Fei Xizhen of the Police Department stated the case, stating that the defendant was arrested for forging documents and committing fraud, that the Police Department's investigation was incomplete, and that a fugitive accomplice needed to be arrested. He requested a postponement and that the defendant be detained temporarily pending a detailed investigation of the case and a request for a hearing. The court verified the report and questioned the defendant Li Benzheng, who admitted that he had written the letter in the name of another person and committed fraud. The court ordered a rehearing on the 6th and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Dancer Huang Aizhen Sues for Indecent Assault: No Withdrawal of Charges Allowed, Trial Concluded Yesterday</h3>
<p>Huang Aizhen, a dancer from Huzhou at the New York Dance Hall, previously had her father, Huang Wenkui, as her legal representative, retain a lawyer to sue Jiang Bifeng, a shareholder of the Xiaoyao Dance Hall, in the First Special District Court for indecent assault. The case had been heard twice. Because the two parties had reached a settlement outside of court, the attorney representing the plaintiff requested to withdraw the charges. However, Judge Jiang Shuzi, presiding over the case, ruled that withdrawal was not permitted because the alleged violation of Article 240 of the Criminal Code, as claimed by the plaintiff, was not subject to settlement, and rescheduled the hearing. Details were previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon was the date for the continuation of the hearing. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were present in court awaiting instructions. The plaintiff, Huang Wenkui, claimed to be a 47-year-old native of Huzhou, currently residing at the home of a relative at No. 4, Yikangli, Xinkai Road, and that Aizhen was his 16-year-old daughter who had been betrothed to someone in her hometown but had not yet married. He was suing the defendant for seducing his daughter, but that the details needed to be asked of Aizhen. Furthermore, as the case had already been settled, he did not wish to pursue the matter further. Huang Aizhen then claimed to be 16 years old, born in December, initially claiming to be a "sheep" (肖羊) and then a "monkey" (肖猴). She began working as a dance partner at the Xiaoyao Dance Hall on July 1st of this year. She subsequently had a relationship with the defendant and rented a house together at No. 10, Chengqili, Race Course Road. They had now written a document severing the cohabitation relationship. The defendant, Jiang Bifeng, claimed that the plaintiff Huang Aizhen was already 21 years old and previously cohabitated with her lover, Zhou Ziyu, at No. 50, Xiangfen Lane. When she joined the Xiaoyao Dance Hall in July of this year, Huang also claimed to be 21 years old. As he was a shareholder of the dance hall, he became acquainted with Huang. On the night of August 17th, Huang was arguing with her lover at the entrance of the dance hall and they went to the Chengdu Road Police Station together, where she also reported that she was 21 years old. These facts could be investigated. Later, Huang Aizhen fell ill and did not have the money for medical treatment, so he provided it. After recovering, she voluntarily cohabitated with him and sent a letter to her father, Huang Wenkui, who replied and permitted it. Therefore, on September 18th, he signed a cohabitation agreement with Huang, with lawyer Cao Lin as the witness. The agreement stated that Huang Jinbao (Aizhen) was 21 years old. He submitted the agreement to the court. Huang Aizhen also stated that when she was a dancer at Xiaoyao, she claimed to be 21 years old because according to the dance hall's regulations, those under 16 were not allowed to dance. After Judge Jiang verified the statements, he made the following pronouncement: "Today, this court received an anonymous letter stating that the plaintiff and his daughter colluded to extort the defendant, and that the name Huang Wenkui is false and that there is actually no such person." He then asked Huang whether the person present today was her father named Huang Wenkui, and the woman replied that he was indeed her father Huang Wenkui. Judge Jiang then questioned the defendant Jiang Bifeng whether he had written the letter, to which Jiang replied that he did not know. After arguments by the defendant's lawyer, Zhou Yongding, the court ordered the case to be continued and the verdict to be announced next Monday. Jiang Bifeng paid a bail of 500 yuan.</p>

<h3>Typesetter Threatens Shop Owner After Losing Job: Prosecutor Believes He Should Be Punished for Infringement of Freedom</h3>
<p>Gu Qi, also known as Shao Rong, a 19-year-old native of Pudong, previously worked as a typesetter at a printing shop opened by Li Haigen, a native of Nanhui, at No. 111, Oujia Road, Hongkou. He lost his job this autumn for some reason, and then sent a letter to Li Haigen in August, containing many threats and demanding 500 yuan. Li initially ignored it, and Gu did not take further action. However, on the 27th of last month, Gu suddenly wrote another letter to Li, with even more intense threats, but without mentioning the demand for money. Li still did not respond. On the 30th, he learned that Gu had been arrested by the New Zhapu Police Station for other matters, and then reported the matter to the Jiaxing Road Police Station. The police chief dispatched detectives to the New Zhapu Police Station to inquire and learned that Gu had been charged with fraud, but it had been determined that there was no connection. Therefore, the detective brought Gu back to the Jiaxing Road Police Station. Yesterday morning, he was handed over to the First Special District Local Court. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu prosecuted Gu under Article 346, Section 3 of the Criminal Code for attempted extortion, and Li Haigen appeared in court to testify about receiving the two letters. However, he was unable to produce the first letter he received, and only presented the most recent letter. Judge Xiao then questioned the defendant, and Gu admitted that the letter presented by Li was written by him, but denied the first letter received by Li, and claimed that the letter only contained angry words and did not contain any intention to forcibly demand 500 yuan. Prosecutor Song then rose to argue that the defendant's actions did not constitute the crime of extortion, and requested that he be punished for infringement of freedom under Article 305 of the Criminal Code. Judge Xiao then ordered the conclusion of the arguments, and the defendant was detained pending sentencing on Friday.</p>
<h3>Family Disputes Continue After the Death of Fei Keming: Fei Yusheng Sues Brother for Defamation Again</h3>

All of these were separately judged by the court. Fei Yusheng, because his brother Fei Fuksheng had distributed pamphlets accusing him of embezzling property, believed that it constituted defamation. He retained lawyer Hong Weimei to sue Fei Fuksheng in the First Special District Court for defamation, requesting that he be punished under Article 310, Section 2 of the Criminal Code. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ye Shengchao of Criminal Division 5 summoned them. The defendant, Fei Fuksheng, retained lawyer Huang Zongxun to defend him. His defense was that the pamphlets were advocated by four siblings, and were intended to request friends and relatives to uphold justice, and did not have the intention to defame. Judge Ye then interrogated both parties and ordered the start of arguments, and then concluded them, scheduling a date for sentencing. Fei Fuksheng posted bail of 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Attention of Russian Émigrés: Murder Case – More Than One Hundred Spectators – The Murderer's Account of the Incident</h3>
<p>The forty-eight-year-old Russian, Botkilian (transliteration), the owner of a Russian bakery and confectionery shop at No. 234-6 Avenue Albert, French Concession, became enraged because his employed fellow countryman, Semianov, thirty years old, had committed an indecent act against Botkilian's seven-year-old daughter. After the fact, the child told her mother, who then informed Botkilian. Unable to contain his anger, Botkilian confronted Semianov on the upper floor of the shop at 2:00 PM on the 26th of last month. Semianov not only refused to admit wrongdoing but also became aggressive. This further enraged Botkilian, who then took a beef-carving knife and stabbed Semianov to death. The deceased suffered ten stab wounds all over his body. Afterward, Botkilian surrendered himself to the French police station. The police detained him and transported the body to the coroner's office, requesting the Special No. 2 Court to send personnel to examine it. Botkilian was then sent to the Special No. 2 Court for interrogation and preliminary investigation. All these details have been reported in this newspaper. The case was concluded by the French Police Department, and the defendant was brought before the Special No. 2 Court for further interrogation yesterday afternoon. More than a hundred Russians, men, women, and children, attended the court hearing. At 11:00 AM, Judge Zhang Chaozuo presided over the hearing in the First Criminal Court. Attorney Fei Xizhen of the Police Department presented the case, charging the defendant with murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Code. Subsequently, the Western detective in charge of the case from the Police Department reported on the investigation process. The defendant was interpreted by Zhang Qingchun, the Russian translator of the High Court. According to the translated testimony, the deceased committed an indecent act against Botkilian's daughter. When Botkilian questioned the deceased, he became threatening, so Botkilian grabbed a sharp knife, intending only to scare him. However, the deceased forcefully seized the knife from his hand, resulting in an injury to his own throat, which led to his death. The defense lawyers, including Premier Lawyer, were hired to defend him. The court also summoned the defendant's wife and daughter for questioning. The court then adjourned, scheduling a later date for further proceedings. The defendant remains in custody.</p>

<h3>Medical World</h3>
<p>The Effective Medicine for High Blood Pressure, Rest-Quell Spirit – High blood pressure is the cause of stroke, and there has never been a good treatment. Since British doctors invented the effective medicine for high blood pressure, "Rest-Quell Spirit," it has been highly valued by the medical community in various countries. Articles on the results of "Rest-Quell Spirit" in medical journals have been continuously published. The first users of this medicine in our country were hospitals in various church groups. Four years ago, when the Chinese Medical Association held a national conference, members presented articles on Rest-Quell Spirit. However, this medicine had no distribution point in China and had to be ordered from the United States, which was very inconvenient. Since the beginning of the year, the American pharmaceutical factory has entrusted the Zhongxi Pharmacy on Four Horses Road in Shanghai as the general manager for China, making it convenient for buyers. Initially, due to the price of gold, the selling price was quite high. When the price of gold was lowest this summer, the pharmacy re-ordered a new price, greatly reducing it. Recently, the price of gold has risen again, and the price of many imported goods has risen again. However, the pharmacy has sufficient stock of Rest-Quell Spirit and does not raise prices.

<h3>Czech Davis Cup Player Meng Ruier Performed in Shanghai Yesterday – Wonderful Shots in Succession, Worthy of a First-Class Player – Performing Two Singles and Doubles Matches, Departing for Hong Kong Today</h3>
<p>Czechoslovakian Davis Cup representatives Meng Ruier and Haixu, who were performing in Japan, passed through Shanghai yesterday on their way back to Europe. They arrived here on the Japanese ship Qingguo Maru. The Shanghai Chinese Tennis Club specially invited Meng and Haixu to perform, with Carson and Defu as their partners, performing one singles and one doubles match each. Many Chinese and Western tennis fans went to watch, about a thousand people, mostly Westerners. The weather was cold, but there was such a grand occasion, which shows their appeal. The singles and doubles were won by the Czech players. The wonderful parts were met with continuous applause. Mr. Meng left Shanghai this morning for Hong Kong, or may visit India, it is said.</p>
<p>Skill</p>
<p>Mr. Meng is the seventh-ranked male singles player in the world on grass courts. Last year, in Wimbledon, he reached the last eight in singles. Yesterday's performance showed wonderful skills in succession, worthy of a famous player. He defeated Carson in straight sets, without fully displaying his strengths. The most noticeable thing was his extraordinary quickness, with a powerful high-pressure, much better than Xu Chengji. His backhand accuracy is unparalleled, and he mostly wins with his backhand. His forehand is rather average. He often goes to the net, and his volleys and half-volleys in front of the net are also his strengths. Wei Xun's performance also had many wonderful shots, but unfortunately, in front of a famous player, his courage was too small. Later, he discovered Meng's weakness and repeatedly attacked Meng's forehand, scoring many points. Haixu is younger and has refined tennis skills. Although he has no special points, he is capable in all aspects and refined. He has a promising future. The doubles performance of the two is not as good as their singles. Their cooperation is not yet in a good state. In the first set, Card was very likely to win, but unfortunately, Defu often made mistakes, often making mistakes at important moments, so there was not much excitement.</p>

<p>Singles</p>
<p>The singles match was Meng Ruier vs. Carson. Meng Ruier served first, extremely sharp. Carson was unable to cope with the left and right blocks, and was defeated in a single set. Carson tried to cheer up, using long shots from the baseline, Meng slightly negligent, and each scored one point. After that, Meng sailed smoothly, with long shots far away, the ball deep into the sidelines, and sometimes he went to the net to block, or lightly or obliquely or pressed or picked, and although Carson had a good performance, but it was difficult to succeed, and there were many errors, so he lost the first set with a score of 1 to 6. Meng took advantage of the winning streak, using his refined tennis skills, using his racket, with powerful cuts, and winning three consecutive sets. By the fourth set, Carson displayed his strengths, winning after several ties. Although Meng's serve was fast, it lacked accuracy, and his high-ball smash was unique. Carson relied on his long shots and took advantage of Meng's weakness and fatigue, winning two more sets, but in the end he was defeated by his inferior skills. Meng also won the second set with a score of 6 to 3. In the third set, Carson served first. Carson worked hard to fight, with good performances, winning the second set after fierce competition, but the strength was disparate, and he finally lost with a score of 6 to 1.</p>
<p>Doubles</p>
<p>The doubles match was held after the singles, Meng Ruier, Haixu vs. Carson, Defu. At the beginning of the battle, the line-up of both sides was quite loose. Meng Ruier was tall, Haixu was short, and the cooperation was not good. Carson and Defu were also as expected, with more errors. The Czech team first won two sets, and then lost one set by suicide. After that, there were errors on both sides from time to time, and the Shanghai team chased to four to four. The Czech team relied on Meng to win. Back and forth, and equal again, and finally Meng's skills were superior, and the Czech team won the first set with a score of nine to seven. After this, the Czech team still dominated. Defu Carson made mistakes in succession, and the offense and defense were not appropriate. Meng's serve was like a cannonball, and Haixu gradually got into the groove, handy. They won the second set with a score of 6 to 2. In the third set, Carson took the lead in serving, winning one set, and then pressed hard. Meng and Hai were very negligent, and Shanghai won the last set with a score of 6 to 2. The performance of the two sides gradually improved, the situation was tense, the score was quite close, and Meng still won with a score of 6 to 4.</p>

<h3>Western Youth Basketball Opened Last Night – Jinan First Wins Over Youyou – B Group Mingqiang Wins Over Yuezhong – There are Two A Group Games Tonight</h3>
<p>The annual Western Youth Basketball Championship opened last night, with a total of two A and B group games. The B group game between Mingqiang and Yuezhong started first. Mingqiang won with a score of 47 to 30 due to its agility and the integrity of the whole team. The first half was 25 to 8. The A group game between Youyou and Jinan followed. As a result of the fierce fight, Jinan won with a score of 48 to 19 due to the youth of the team. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Jinan Wins Over Youyou</p>
<p>As soon as the two armies touched, there was a fierce and compact melee. After holding for about four minutes, Jinan's forwards became more active, and Han Zhenyuan shot three times and three times. Youyou urgently called a truce. In the sound of the rematch, Youyou Sun Huifei's long shot was successful, and there was a slight turning point, but Jinan still occupied the upper hand due to its pure connection. Youyou could not shoot under the basket due to the strict defense of the opponent's guard. For this reason, the result of the first half was that Jinan still won with a score of 18 to 5. In the second half, Jinan's momentum was even stronger, and the forwards almost never failed to shoot. Youyou tried its best to defend, but there was still a trend that it could not keep up. The final result was 48 to 10.</p>

<h3>Public Exhibition Cup Handball Second Round: China Ahead Three to Two Yesterday; Ball King Zhu Shows His Strength, Shames Past Defeat, and Overcomes Chuckle; Hopeful for Championship if Singles Effort Continues Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The 7th Public Exhibition Cup International Handball Tournament held its second round yesterday, with a total of five matches played. The Chinese team won three matches to two. If they can maintain their advantage in today's singles matches, the doubles will not be a problem, and they will be able to win this year's championship.</p>
<p>Zhu, the Ball King, Avenges Previous Humiliation: Zhu Kuanzhi in handball and Li Huitang in football are both known as "Ball Kings." In the first round, he was unfortunately defeated by Chuckle because he was playing while ill. Yesterday, he had recovered his health and overcame Chuckle with a score of two to one, avenging his humiliation from the previous day. He was dominant from the start, and his corner kicks were Chuckle's Achilles' heel. His smashes and kills were particularly effective. Although Chuckle won the second game, in the end, Zhu Kuanzhi emerged victorious.</p>
<p>Sun Jialu Unfortunately Defeated: Sun Jialu of the Chinese team played the third singles match. Sun has an excellent physique and hits the ball well. In the first round, he had an easy time against Fons. Yesterday, he played against Ryle and had great momentum in the first game, winning 21 to 14. He unfortunately lost the second game by two points. In the crucial third game, he collapsed and was unable to defeat Ryle, despite using both hands. In the end, he lost two to zero.</p>
<p>Ding Bingyao Overwhelmed: Borrelli of the Western team hits the ball well and is very skillful. Ding Bingyao was truly unable to mount any effective resistance, completely under Borrelli's control and unable to score many points. The occasional point or two he scored did not make a difference to the overall situation, and he lost by a large margin of zero to two.</p>
<p>Yan Peiqiu Exceptionally Courageous: Yan Peiqiu was previously defeated by the "sticky" Smith. However, yesterday's match against Lai Jin showed a complete turnaround. He was exceptionally courageous, and his kills were also very effective. Smith was completely under his control, so he won easily against Lai.</p>
<p>Lai Jin Troubled by Baoqi: In the ninth singles match, Sun Baoqi took the court and troubled Lai Jin. He completely failed with scores of 4-21 and 15-21. Sun was vigorous and extraordinarily brave. His previous defeat was truly due to misfortune and not for lack of trying. The scores of yesterday's games and today's schedule are listed below:</p>
<p>Scores of Each Game</p>
<p>Today's Schedule:</p>
<p>Second Singles: Hua Fenggang vs. Cleman</p>

<p>Sixth Singles: Cai Shoutong vs. Ke Xu Nan Neng Ke</p>
<p>Eighth Singles: Huang Kesu vs. Greston</p>

<h3>Recent Situation of Colleges and Universities in Peiping and Tientsin: Education Association Decides to Lead Students to Petition the Authorities; Presidents Bai and Xu of Peida Negotiating with the Ministry of Education in Nanking</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Peiping) The national colleges and universities and private universities in Peiping and Tientsin are extremely concerned about the current situation. The presidents of the four universities, Jiang Menglin, Xu Boming, Mei Yi Qi, and Li Zheng, as well as professors Hu Shi and Jiang Tingfu, visited Song Zheyuan, the garrison commander of Peiping and Tianjin, twice to inquire about the truth.</p>
<p>The Joint Association of Faculty and Staff of National Colleges and Universities in Peiping and Tientsin held a meeting at the Zhongnan East Fourth Office at 10 AM today (the 1st). Committee members Li Xiaoyan, Xu Zhi, Ma Zhidao, Wang Yongquan, Mu Mo, Wang Jixu, Jia Chengzhang, Cai Zengtang, and Yang Likui attended. The chairman first reported on the progress of past association affairs and the work to be carried out in the future, and then reported in detail on the recent situation in North China. After the meeting, the committee members went to the Shuai Fu Yuan Yi Yuan in Dongcheng for a dinner. During the dinner, Yang Likui and Xu Zhi were designated as representatives to contact the authorities of National Peking University, Peiping University, Normal University, and Tsinghua University separately in the next two days, and all faculty, staff, and students will participate in the work. The Education Association representatives plan to petition Song Zheyuan soon and send a telegram regarding the current situation. According to a committee member, given the situation in the North, the central government should make stabilizing people's hearts one of its main tasks. However, the funding for the colleges and universities has not yet been remitted. The Peiping-Tientsin Higher Education Funding Management Committee sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Education today (the 1st) to urge the payment of the funds, as the arrival of the education funds in Peiping would also help stabilize the hearts of the education community. The text of the telegram urging the payment of funds is recorded below: Nanjing Ministry of Finance: The November education funds have not yet been remitted. The colleges and universities are in urgent need of funds. Please remit the funds to Peiping as soon as possible so that they can be disbursed. Peiping-Tientsin Higher Education Funding Management Committee.</p>
<p>Since Bai Pengfei, the dean of the College of Law and Commerce of National Peiping University, and Xu Shoushang, the dean of the Women's College of Arts and Sciences, went to Nanking, the students in each college have been attending classes well. According to professors, rumors of the relocation of Peiping University colleges to the south are not true, considering the overall situation of Peiping University. The students are currently attending classes in compliance with the Ministry of Education's order not to slack off. When Presidents Bai and Xu return to Peiping, there will be a concrete plan. On the day before Presidents Bai and Xu went to Nanking, the professors of each college initiated a professors' meeting, which resulted in two points: (1) Presidents Bai and Xu, representing the entire Peiping University, should go to Nanking to express the sincere attitude of Peking University and ask the Ministry of Education for instructions on all matters. (2) The Peiping University Professors' Conference will publish a letter to the students, praising the drafter. The content of the letter will make an overall and accurate statement to the students. However, whether this letter to the students will be issued will be decided after Presidents Bai and Xu return to Peiping.</p>

<h3>Little Boy</h3>
<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>This made Robert completely convinced, so Nancy led him through the shallow waters, over dangerous rocks, and he followed blindly. After many detours, she led him to a small cave in a large rock, where the scorched stones clearly showed that someone had made a fire there before.</p>
<p>"Isn't this interesting?" Nancy asked, taking a little bread mixed with oil from her bag. However, it no longer resembled a machine because it was mixed with nails, fishhooks, stones, and other debris.</p>
<p>"Yes, but do you think they won't find us?" Robert asked, feeling that the secluded mountain ravine was boring and starting to think about his other companions.</p>
<p>"No, I don't, because if I hear them coming, I'll hide and watch how they look for me. That would be fun."</p>
<p>"They might not come anymore."</p>
<p>"I don't care. I can go back myself."</p>
<p>"Isn't it very far?" Robert asked, looking at his small, rough boots, which were thirsty and covered in scratches after the long journey.</p>
<p>"I think it's about six miles." Nancy's concept of distance was vague, but she was very confident in her abilities.</p>
<p>"I think we should go back now," Robert suggested again soon after.</p>
<p>"I'm not going yet, I want to pick more blackberries," Nancy said, and started picking them. Robert was getting impatient.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the sun went behind the mountain, and he sighed, "You said you would take good care of me."</p>
<p>"I am taking care of you, and doing my best. Don't be fussy, little boy. I'll go in a while." Nancy said, thinking that a six-year-old Robert was just a baby compared to her.</p>
<p>So little Robert sat still, looking around with a worried heart, but he waited patiently, because although he was quite apprehensive, he found Nancy to be very trustworthy.</p>
<p>"I think it will be night soon," he muttered to himself, just as a mosquito bit him and the frogs in the nearby pond began to play their twilight ensemble.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— by Zhou Shoujuan</p>
<p>In the past, when the state of Yue was destroyed by the state of Wu, King Goujian of Yue and his queen were also taken prisoner. King Fucha of Wu ordered him to crawl and acknowledge his submission, so he crawled and acknowledged his submission. He was imprisoned in a stone chamber, so he was imprisoned in a stone chamber. He was even forced to taste excrement, so he tasted excrement, and he was ordered to raise horses, so he raised horses, humbly enduring all kinds of humiliation. It can truly be said that he showed great patience. However, later, with the help of Bo Pi, he was released back to his country. He endured hardship and bitterness, sleeping on brushwood and tasting gall, diligently working in obscurity for ten years to build up resources and ten years to educate the people. In addition, Fan Li and Xi Shi, for the sake of their country, were determined to sacrifice themselves. Finally, he avenged himself, wiped out the humiliation, and destroyed the state of Wu. This ancient story is a very good lesson and a very good example for us. Everyone should keep it in mind and worship King Goujian of Yue as an idol. Recently, I watched the Shanghai Theater's performance of "Xi Shi" in Suzhou, which greatly excited me. The performers, such as Ms. Cheng Jingzi as Xi Shi, Ms. Xu Lilin as Zheng Dan, Lu Pingjun as Fucha, Fan Yinpu as Goujian, Qian Feng as Fan Li, Xing Jinhu as Wu Zixu, and Bai Xiongfei as Bo Pi, all worked very hard, giving us a very deep impression. This makes me even more admire the directing skills of Chen Dabei and Gu Wenzong. After the performance in Suzhou, I heard that they will also perform in Wuxi and Changshu, which is truly a meritorious deed. Lovable artists! I offer you a pinch of incense, wishing you well for the country. Travel thousands of miles, perform thousands of times, to awaken those compatriots who are living in a drunken dream. Having already played the first half of Goujian, don't forget to play the second half of Goujian!</p>
<h3>Hidden Silver</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>Amidst the clamor to abolish silver, two stories of hidden silver, long buried in the depths of my mind, were stirred up.</p>
<p>In my hometown, there was a large farming household, led by an old man with five strong sons and three hired laborers, cultivating over a hundred mu of land. The entire family, young and old, worked diligently, and were unusually frugal, accumulating significant savings each year. Although outwardly they appeared no different from anyone else, those within dozens of miles suspected them to be immensely wealthy. The old man had no love for paper money, only for white silver. He also distrusted banks, so he secretly buried his silver at home, concealing its location even from his five daughters-in-law. One moonlit night three years ago, dozens of armed bandits broke into the household. The family scattered, but the old man was captured. The bandits demanded he reveal the location of the hidden silver, but he refused to hand over his family's hard-earned wealth. The bandits then subjected him to torture, from binding and beating to pouring water over his head and burning his genitals, but he remained steadfastly silent. At this time, two of his daughters-in-law, hiding on the roof ridge, watched the horrific torture of their father-in-law in the rear house. They cried out, urging him to reveal the silver's location. The old man, unable to endure any longer, finally relented. It turned out that in the middle of the main courtyard, there was a brick platform on which sat a large jar of homemade soy sauce. Removing the jar and demolishing the platform revealed a hoard of silver. The bandits filled burlap sacks, hoisted them onto poles, and made off with their loot. Afterwards, the old man told others that they had lost over ten thousand dollars.</p>
<p>In Shanxi, the practice of hiding silver was even more prevalent. One family built a secret cellar in their home, where they melted all their silver dollars into liquid silver and poured it in. Once solidified, it formed a huge silver ingot, easier to preserve and less likely to be stolen. One year, unfortunately, news of this secret reached some mutinous soldiers, who swarmed to the house and broke open the cellar. However, faced with the solid silver, they could find no way to take it. After some futile hammering, they left empty-handed.</p>
<h3>Someone Jumps into the Water</h3>
<p>— Shui Rong</p>
<p>The person has been rescued and is now vomiting on a chair. We don't know what else he threw up besides water. How dark it is here! There's no moon tonight. The light from the white lamp is blocked by the onlookers. A police officer waves his hand, shouting, "Move back, move back!" But no one listens. Those in the back are desperately trying to push forward.</p>
<p>Someone is striking a match. Everyone cranes their necks to see what kind of person this suicidal individual is. In the brief flame, I only catch a glimpse: black cloth jacket, black socks, old black sneakers. His physique and attire make me believe he is around twenty years old. "So young!" I couldn't help but exclaim.</p>
<p>Several Americans are leaning against the railing, discussing how the life preservers are positioned too far away. One asks me, "Does he have any friends here?" I reply, "No."</p>
<p>A terrifying silence reigns over the space. The world-weary person is no longer making a sound. I fear something bad is about to happen. The autumn wind is sobbing through the plane trees.</p>
<p>Finally, the rescue team arrives, causing a stir. Watching them place the dying man on a stretcher and carry him out of the park, the onlookers disperse, talking and laughing.</p>
<p>Alone in this place, I gaze at the pile of discarded belongings on the ground, then at the vast, dark, oily Huangpu River, feeling an inexplicable sorrow. Why would someone try to end their own life? Doesn't everyone have a desire to live? And he is so young. He doesn't seem to have been driven to it by love, so the most likely reason must be economic pressure. If that's the case, aren't we—aren't we all partly responsible? Human progress means the improvement of everyone's life. Isn't suicide a disgrace to humanity? And what am I to make of the onlookers' laughter and chatter?</p>
<p>Let me pray for that unfortunate person!</p>
<p>Literary News: In recent years, the public has become increasingly interested in modern songs, and the sales of songbooks have increased daily. The "Collection of Songs of Autumn Memories," recently published by the Fine Arts Bookstore, is the new work of Mr. Yin Yiqiu, a former professor at the China Conservatory of Music. It contains over twenty new songs, such as "Waves," "New Little Shepherd Boy," and "Labor is Sacred," as well as thirty-four older works such as "National Flower," "What is Love," and "I Cannot Forget You," all proofread by Mr. Yin himself more than three times to ensure accuracy. It is now available from the Zhongqingji Bookstore on Four Horses Road, and all bookstores in this city and other locales have it for sale.</p>
<h3>Folk Sketches</h3>
<p>— Juan Yin</p>
<p>Several catties of wine, many pots of tea, talking grandly, accomplishing nothing!</p>
<h3>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</h3>
<p>— Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>Random Notes on Storytelling</p>
<p>The novel *Romance of the Three Kingdoms* can truly be considered a household name in China. If one says that men who have read *Dream of the Red Chamber* want to emulate Jia Baoyu, and women want to emulate Lin Daiyu, then I dare to assert that those who have read *Romance of the Three Kingdoms* all want to emulate Zhuge Kongming!</p>
<p>Because readers of *Romance of the Three Kingdoms* all sympathize with the Shu Han, hoping that Liu Xuande can "rebuild the mountains and rivers"! And Kongming is the pillar of Shu Han, so their attention naturally focuses on him. Therefore, some say that after reading the part in *Romance of the Three Kingdoms* where Kongming dies at Wuzhang Plains, they can't bear to read any further! Even reading on will only deepen their lament! The direction of people's hearts is truly profound!</p>
<p>In fact, those who stop reading after Kongming's death at Wuzhang Plains are still quite patient! If it were me, after Lü Ziming crossed the river in disguise, the rest of *Romance of the Three Kingdoms* wouldn't need to be read! Because after the loss of Jingzhou, the Shu Han's foothold was gone. Even with Kongming's talent, he could only maneuver around Qishan, ultimately leading to a partial peace and inevitable downfall! This is the factual proof that "Han and traitors cannot coexist."</p>
<p>Kongming foresaw all of this long ago! In his Longzhong Plan, he clearly determined that the world would be divided into three parts, but he still followed Liu Xuande desperately to fight the rebels! To restore the Han Dynasty! Giving his all! Until his death! Kongming's ability to leave a lasting name is not due to his accomplishments or his talent, but to his extremely devoted and loyal heart. This is what many of our unmotivated descendants should deeply encourage themselves to emulate!</p>
<p>Let me repeat a few of Kongming's famous words to you all! During the Longzhong Plan, he said to Liu Xuande, "The north allows Cao Cao to gain the opportune time, the east allows Sun Quan to gain the geographical advantage, and the general can take Xichuan and occupy the people's harmony." It can be seen that Liu Adou was able to be a muddle-headed emperor in Sichuan for more than forty years entirely relying on the power of "people's harmony"! If a country loses both the opportune time and the geographical advantage, and also loses the people's harmony, I want to ask you all, what power does it rely on to survive in this dog-eat-dog world!</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty-One: Gently Relying on Others, Passing the Courtyard to Admire the Moon's Beauty; Ardent Teaching of the Son-in-Law, Listening to the Lion's Roar from the Next Room</p>
<p>The woman yields the path: I insist on interfering, if the one with the surname Jia is mistreating him, I, Jin Rongxue, will file a lawsuit against him. Fortunately, there is a specialist stationed here in Little Western Paradise to investigate human morality. If one wants to file a complaint, one can do so here at the hotel. The bureau chief says: Hey, sister-in-law, you don't need to interfere here, you should leave. Following these words, the Hu sister-in-law grabbed the wall, passing the window, slowly walking away, head bowed. However, the woman in the western suit immediately ran with the sound of her high heel shoes, grabbing the Hu sister-in-law’s hands. One can see her face clearly now, covered in a thick layer of powder like lime. However, amidst the thick powder, uneven purple bumps are scattered all over. Both eyebrows are cleanly plucked, but two thick scars of skin remain, and she painted ink lines on top of the scars. Her eyes are as big as walnuts, with a radish flower on her right eyelid. Her nose is quite high, but below her nose, her two thick lips are flipped inside out, revealing two rows of messy teeth. She says: What are you afraid of? If I don't let you leave, no one would dare to make you leave. Do you think he is a boss? That is nothing. Without me, he could not be a boss. Just come in with me to talk. The Hu sister-in-law had famously small feet. How could she endure such a powerful tug? In an unbalanced position, she was tugged into the house. When Bei Hai heard the wife asking the Hu sister-in-law, his bottom, was tense and tight. As the Hu sister-in-law ran out, he exhaled a breath of air. His bottom revealed a hint of disappointment. As the Hu sister-in-law re-entered, he lifted his dejected face again, and smiled to Zhi Qian: At least like this, he can come up with some way. (370)</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Remarks</p>
<h3>Sitting in the Empty Courtyard in the Rain</h3>
<p>— Luo Dian</p>
<p>My mood is like a gloomy rainy day. Even if there is a sliver of blue sky, it is soon blown away by the wind, turning into a vast, pale haze. My whole body is enveloped in layers of pale mist. I cannot see the sun's smile, nor can I hear the breath of the human world. Because in the vast empty courtyard, only I remain. If the thrush under the reed curtain occasionally sings a charming new song, this almost mocking sound only further emphasizes the stillness of midday. I am somewhat afraid to hear it. Truly, there is nothing more lonely than the faint sighs of the reeds occasionally rustling on the shore. I understand this environment. It is best to sit near the window, pour a cup of bitter tea, and watch the steam rise from the tea leaves and slowly dissipate. There is no need to study the physics of pressure, nor to seek elegant verses, much less to reminisce about the past or predict the future. Perhaps I can temporarily forget myself and seep into a more magical, more profound dream, thus finding happiness. However, though I am lonely, I am also alone. I feel the chill. How can I know that someone is rushing to a school far away in western Shanghai during this public holiday because of my powerlessness! Is it right to call him away from home, away from me, in the gloomy early winter, when the wind has grown sharp and the rain is falling madly? And does he have the heart to leave home and me? Let me think leisurely: the person running on the rainy street does not hate the excessive amount of work he is carrying. And I, sitting at home doing nothing, dare to complain of loneliness? Isolation? Even if I am truly bored, I deserve to suffer! Can I chew half a word? I must awaken my conscience. A young child is searching for food for me at this moment! Does he not understand the "sadness of shadows"? And he doesn't even speak Guangzhou dialect!</p>
<p>So I smile. Happy raindrops shower my forehead. Carrying a spirit that is lighter than benzoin, I gradually stroll into the courtyard. On the white stones of the courtyard, pearls of light dance, and I breathe in a refreshing, sweet breeze. My limbs and eyes feel comfortable and clear. A refreshing cold air, along with two droplets, strikes my hair, flies into my skin, and penetrates deep into my heart. I feel especially energetic and excited, as if my eyes, having just escaped from a bitter prison, have been struck by a golden arrow of sunlight.</p>
<p>All hatred of oneself or others is caused by unwillingness to forgive. There is nothing that cannot be resolved if you can take a step back. Even the world could be without war. But regardless of so-called sages or rogues, few have any interest in considering "forgiveness," so the blood of struggle forever satirizes the armor of civilization. "True love" is nowhere to be seen between people!</p>
<p>Thank you for this refreshing winter rain, which has enlightened me with extraordinary wisdom. I pull up a rattan chair and sit by the lotus flower pot, letting the spiritual rain of the day irrigate the brains of ignorant people.</p>
<p>Everyone who hears of lotus flowers will think of the fragrant breeze of June. In this season of scattered leaves, it seems unnecessary to mention them. But precisely for this reason, I am even more willing to pay attention to them. I still remember when I first moved here, this courtyard was full of lotus flowers. In the muddy water of each flower pot, small goldfish swam back and forth, shimmering among the green stems and red flowers, very beautiful. Whenever it rained, raindrops poured from the lotus leaves, dripping into the pot, and the small goldfish would open their mouths, instinctively swallowing, then flick their tails and swim away gracefully. This beautiful impression is truly difficult for me to forget. But now, the lotus roots have long been ground into powder and used as food; the lotus stems have been broken and sent to pharmacies. Where are the flowers now? Even those exquisite goldfish have gradually died, leaving very few. And the few that remain have been moved into the white porcelain bowls in the study, as ornaments for the windows, because they cannot bear the cold. Of course, they cannot absorb natural spring dew and seem to show signs of decline. It is hard to say if their fate will allow them to survive until the New Year. Flowers and fish, on this rainy day, cannot help but make me feel sad for myself! Moreover, the dried-up lotus pot is gradually filled with clear water, reflecting a thin face?</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn and Raw Cotton: Local Cotton Resists European Winds, Cotton Prices Soar by Over One Yuan, Speculators Suddenly Buy: Market Advances Steadily</h3>
<p>The cotton market is experiencing a sharp rise, with a very strong market sentiment. This is due to continuous purchases by foreign merchants, creating strong upward pressure and causing the market to dry up. According to market sources, Fook Cheong &amp; Co. shipped cotton purchased last month to Germany. This news has further fueled market enthusiasm, with widespread buying interest driving prices up by over one yuan across all months.</p>
<p>Difficult to Match, with Rapid Advance</p>
<p>At the opening of the cotton market, prices across all months jumped sharply. Strong buying interest prevailed, leading to a tense situation. Market rumors suggested that Chinese cotton was being shipped to Germany, and that goods purchased by Mei An last month were also being exported. These rumors, all favorable to buyers, fueled intense speculation. Speculators suddenly made concerted efforts to buy, causing the market to become extremely tight and prices to advance steadily. As a result, prices for all months rose by 80 fen to 1.05 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon, buying interest remained strong, with especially strong buying of the May contract, pushing it past the 5 yuan mark. However, as Cheung Woh dumped large quantities, prices eased slightly. Ultimately, prices for all months rose by 5 to 30 fen compared to the morning closing price. Sales included 2,400 bales of Da Fu, 1,500 bales of Yi Yu, 4,000 bales of Da Feng, 5,000 bales of Yuan Da, 2,000 bales of Chang Ji, 4,900 bales of Shen Chang, 2,400 bales of Tai Chang, 2,600 bales of Yi Chang, 2,600 bales of Chang Feng, 4,300 bales of Yi Kang, 4,100 bales of Yuan Xing Chang, and 11,100 bales of Cheung Woh.

<h3>Cotton Prices Soar, Yarn Market Gains Momentum, May Contract Reaches a High of 209 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending upward, with a remarkably strong upward momentum and an exceptionally favorable situation. As cotton prices strengthen and cotton yarn costs continue to rise, the yarn market is entering a favorable period. According to another source, a key figure has gone north, raising hopes for improved conditions, which has boosted market confidence. Speculators are once again buying heavily, driving the market higher and higher. The opening price for the May contract today was 205.4 yuan, 11.4 yuan higher than the previous month's contract price.</p>
<p>Golden Roosters Rise by Three to Four Yuan</p>
<p>Before the opening of the yarn market, there was widespread discussion among market participants that the tense situation in North China would lead to a decline. As a result, the opening prices for the nearest two months fell by 5, 7, and 8 jiao. However, prices for the distant months were strong, rising by several jiao. By the second and third rounds of trading, the cotton market was soaring, and the yarn market gained even more momentum. The December contract rose sharply by 3.3 yuan, and prices for the distant months also rose sharply. By the closing, there were reports of active spot yarn sales, further bolstering market sentiment. As a result, prices for all months rose by 2.6 to 3.4 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon, market sentiment followed the morning's price increases, with speculators continuing to push prices higher. Although Yi Chang sold off positions, market enthusiasm remained high. By the closing, prices had fallen back slightly by several jiao. Ultimately, prices for all months rose by 2.7 to 8 jiao compared to the morning closing price.

<h3>Increased Arrivals, Indian Cotton Slightly Weak</h3>
<p>The trend last week was unstable. Pirgol cotton was relatively weak due to numerous arrivals. Brokers and exporters sold short on rallies, while futures traders bought on dips. European demand is reportedly active, and the renewed activity in France is also noteworthy. Japanese inquiries are limited, and Chinese interest is non-existent. In the spot market, Japanese trading of Pirgol rain and Omra cotton is very active. The footing of Benjemen cotton is slightly weak. Collection is rapid, and arrivals are increasing daily. However, the collection of Omra cotton is not very strong. The appended statistics for the past week are as follows (in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>1934 1935</p>
<p>Cumulative collections from September 1 181 190</p>
<p>Weekend inventory 494 376</p>

<h3>Securities: Bonds Continue to Rise, Many Bulls Cashing Out at High Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was established, and Broker No. 33, acting on behalf of a bank, bought to push up prices. Unfortunately, those selling were either bulls cashing out or spot goods being released. For example, Bulls No. 35 and 48 were cashing out, taking advantage of the price increases to get good prices. Northern firms and retail investors were mostly releasing spot goods, making the future outlook for market prices a cause for concern. Yesterday's trading consisted of four sessions. At the morning opening, it was already known that there would be another round of price manipulation, and No. 35 and 48 seized the opportunity to cash out, a very good opportunity. No. 7, 8, and retail investors also sold slightly. The main buyer was No. 33, supported by No. 4, 16, 40, and 54. Prices were pushed up by several jiao to 1.15 yuan. In the second session, selling remained strong, especially from No. 48 and 54, while buyers continued to push up prices, raising them by another several jiao to 1 yuan. At the afternoon opening, although No. 31, 16, and 47 were still buying, selling from No. 4, 5, 24, and 48 gradually increased, and No. 33 began to struggle to cope, leading to a general decline of 30 to 50 fen. News at the close was not good, and firms like No. 35 and 43 were selling, but trading was light and few were willing to buy. Market prices fell further by 20 to 50 fen. The future will depend on changes in the overall situation. In the end, market prices rose by several jiao to over one yuan, with the December 22nd Customs bond showing the largest increase, rising sharply by 1.35 yuan. The total trading volume was 25.74 million yuan. The results of the price changes are compared and listed in the table on the left (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3>Grains: Spot Sales Stagnant, Little Trading in Flour</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market initially showed weakness but then stabilized. At the morning opening, prices were lower than the previous month's closing prices by a little over 2 fen, due to declines in Chicago wheat futures of 3-4 cents and Canadian wheat futures of 4-5 jiao, as well as concerns about the chaotic situation in the north. However, the weakness subsided after the second round, and with factories not selling, speculators took advantage of the uncertainty in foreign wheat prices to continue buying, causing the market to rebound by a little over 1 fen. At the afternoon opening, trading was initially active, but later stalled due to stagnant spot sales and little trading. Prices fluctuated, and the final results showed prices up by 2.5 li to 1 fen compared to the previous month's closing prices. Trading in the May contract has been temporarily suspended due to the transition between old and new harvests, low wheat inventories, and uncertainty in foreign wheat prices. The exchange has temporarily suspended trading to reduce risks.</p>

<h3>Futures Wheat Empty Trading in Every Session</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market saw extremely quiet trading in both the morning and afternoon sessions. Most months saw empty trading in every session. This was partly due to the approaching Lunar New Year, with traders preparing to close out positions, and partly due to concerns about the tense situation in the north, even though it had not yet materialized. However, foreign wheat prices and low domestic inventories supported market sentiment. Prices for the near-month contract were up by 3-5 fen compared to the previous month's closing price. The spot wheat market saw active trading, with prices trending steadily. Shandong Mingguang, Yingzhou, Bengbu, and Shaheji wheat opened at 5.06 yuan, and Danyang wheat opened at 5 yuan, with a total of 4,000 bags purchased by Fuxin.</p>

<h3>客秈 (Ke Xian) Rice Sales Slightly Active in Local Market, 客囤 (Ke Tun) Suddenly Stalled</h3>
<p>Yesterday, arrivals of 客秈 (Ke Xian) rice were very strong, with rice from various provinces including Hunan, Jiangxi, Hankou, Shashi, Anhui, Fujian, Zhejiang arriving at the port, and inventories were also sufficient. However, after briefly attempting to operate in the previous two days,囤户 (Tun Hu) immediately stopped. Northern merchants have been continuously purchasing 河下杜粳 (He Xia Du Geng) rice, showing no interest in 客秈 (Ke Xian) rice, leading to a very soft market. Subsequently, local merchants took advantage of the low prices to buy, which helped stabilize the market. A total of over 2,500 bags of Jiangxi rice, 200 bags of Hunan rice, 500 bags of Shashi and Hankou rice, 200 bags of Nanling rice, and over 2,100 bags of rice from Ningbo, Wenzhou, and Taizhou, 850 bags of Nanjing秈 (Xian) rice, 250 bags of Fujian rice were traded, with prices similar to the previous market. However, foreign rice was scarce and prices were good by 3 fen, with 100 bags of Saigon No. 1 sold at 11.03 yuan, purchased by local merchants.</p>
<h3>薄稻 (Bo Dao) Rice Continues to Sell in the North</h3>
<p>(沪南) (Hu Nan): Yesterday, sources from various firms numbered over forty (goods totaling over 8,000 shi). The local market seemed slightly more active. Firms continued to purchase over 4,000 bags for Tianjin, Qingdao, Weihaiwei, and other destinations, causing the market for 薄稻 (Bo Dao) rice to tighten slightly and prices to rebound by 6-7 fen. However, it remained difficult to increase prices for 厚早 (Hou Zao) and other 粳 (Geng) rice. 杜洋尖 (Du Yang Jian) showed neither honor nor disgrace, and the ones with阴变 (Yin Bian) were priced higher, while the ones in the central market were priced the same.</p>
<p>(沪北) (Hu Bei): Yesterday, the source from various routes of 河下 (He Xia) was quite strong, numbering approximately eighty firms. The outflow of 白粳 (Bai Geng) in the market remained normal, with prices slightly lower by 1-2 jiao. There continued to be arrival of 薄稻 (Bo Dao), with retail sales sluggish and prices short by a corner. 羊埠尖 (Yang Bu Jian) had balanced sales, and the price was also stable. 杜尖 (Du Jian) was scarce and strong, 客尖 (Ke Jian) was flat, and the remaining goods showed a slightly soft trend.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Guangdong Sugar Tender Offer Unsuccessful at Original Price</h3>
<p>The sugar market yesterday saw little change due to sluggish spot sales. Public fruit plate two four coarse granulated white sugar was quoted at 21.8 yuan for spot and 6.9 yuan for re-export, but there were few takers. 本厂 (Ben Chang) Mian Bai sugar, Zhen Ji No. 1 was 20.8 yuan, No. 2 was 5 jiao, No. 3 was 1 jiao, No. 4 was 19.9 yuan, and No. 5 was 7 jiao. The Sugar Industry Cooperative's Five Mou Guangdong coarse white was tendered at 21.8 yuan, re-export Dutch coarse white at 6.9 yuan, No. 2 Five Yang Mian Bai at 21.05 yuan, and No. 4 at 20.85 yuan. Due to the lack of interest from merchants, the transaction failed. Other grades of sugar were only quoted, and the market appeared weak.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Sichuan Pickled Mustard Tuber Rises Again by Five to Six Jiao</h3>
<p>Sichuan pickled mustard tubers have continued to arrive in small quantities recently, and merchants have continued to absorb them. It has been purchased at prices from 13-14 yuan to 12.5 yuan, up by 5-6 jiao, with over a thousand deals made. The existing inventory of 客货 (Ke Huo) is only a little over a thousand pieces, so the trend is very strong and there is a sign of further tightening.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: 芦庄 (Lu Zhuang) Green Tea Sells Smoothly, Sales Turn Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign trading houses in the tea market saw increased sales of green teas such as 婺源 (Wu Yuan) and 屯溪 (Tun Xi) grades such as 珍眉 (Zhen Mei) and 针眉 (Zhen Mei) for European sales. British trading house Ewo Yih &amp; Co. received orders from Morocco and purchased in large quantities. 永兴 (Yong Xing), 同孚 (Tong Fu), and other firms also made scattered replenishments. Total city transactions were over 1,500 boxes. The price of 珍眉 (Zhen Mei) opened at 50 yuan, and 针眉 (Zhen Mei) sold for prices ranging from 20 to 32 yuan, a drop of 3-4 yuan compared to the previous price. The reason for the activity in the current market is the decrease in tea prices.</p>
<h3>Survey: Cost of Living Index for Workers in This City</h3>
<p>(November)</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau announced the cost of living index for workers. The cost of living index for workers in Shanghai in November was 101.49, an increase of 4.05% compared to the previous month and a decrease of 2.41% compared to the same month last year. After the Ministry of Finance announced the implementation of monetary policy on the 4th of this month, prices in this city rose sharply. Although retail shops that traded in copper coins or small silver dollars did not formally increase prices, prices actually felt higher due to the exchange rate. Therefore, with the exception of rice, which fell once, all other prices rose, especially those of flour, bean oil, kerosene, and white sugar. The comparison of various category indices is listed below:</p>
<p>Category November 1934 October 1934 November 1933</p>
<p>Food 90.63 88.49 94.55</p>

<h3>Uniform Hotel Room Rates Established by Hotel Association</h3>
<p>— Zi Nan</p>
<p>Having been in Shanghai for over five years, I believe I have some knowledge of the rise of Shanghai's hotel industry. If we take a stroll down Tibet Road, we'll see that it's almost entirely lined with hotels. Five years ago, there weren't nearly as many, and certainly none as grand and luxurious as they are now.</p>
<p>Four or five years ago, passing through Tibet Road late at night, what impression would we get? Broadly speaking, it was a city that never slept. Even at two or three in the morning, the sounds of dice games, dominoes, and women's songs mixed with stringed instruments filled the streets, with bright lights shining from every window.</p>
<p>(Shanghai's hotels don't cater to "travelers." Hotels are merely havens for Shanghai residents to indulge in entertainment and leisure, which invariably involves drinking, prostitution, and gambling.)</p>
<p>Now, if you pass through there at midnight, you'll notice that the bright lights in every window that were common four or five years ago are now rarely seen. Although the lights at the entrances remain, even brighter than before, they are hardly a sign of luxury. Instead, they probably signify "pay by the day" or a discount rate.</p>
<p>After the economic downturn hit, the countryside was the first to suffer. Shanghai, being a so-called economic, commercial, and cultural-political center, initially showed signs of hyperemia when the downturn first arrived. This hyperemia, however, soon turned into edema as anemia in other sectors deepened. While things might appear the same on the surface, the situation is actually no better than in the countryside.</p>
<p>Recently, these symptoms have become impossible to conceal and have gradually spread from other businesses to the hotel industry.</p>
<p>In the closing years of the century, the extravagance of the petty bourgeoisie and the wealthy was a defining characteristic. Seeing the decline of their class and unable to resist, they embraced hedonism, desperately seeking material and spiritual enjoyment and stimulation. Hotels, as havens for drinking, prostitution, and gambling, became the best places to go.</p>
<p>However, in recent years, with the increasing economic panic, the petty bourgeoisie has found it increasingly difficult to sustain their lifestyle. Consequently, large hotels have had to resort to offers like "buy one night, get one free" and "discounts" to attract customers.</p>
<p>These "buy one, get one free" or "buy one, get two free" and "discount" schemes have disrupted room rates within the industry. As a result, the Hotel Association has established six measures to "uniform hotel room rates" and "implement discounts."</p>
<p>However, whether the standardization of room rates can be achieved through the Hotel Association's resolutions remains to be seen. While the resolution to "prevent disguised standard discount violations, such as gifts, after implementing an 80% discount rate" can be enforced by the Hotel Association, how can we guarantee that individual hotels won't lower their original prices? Furthermore, even if room rates are set by the Hotel Association "based on cost considerations to determine a balanced price," can this guarantee improvement in business?</p>
<p>If the fundamental problems remain unresolved, what is the use of merely achieving "uniform room rates"?</p>
<p>And these so-called fundamental problems arise from the social structure.</p>
<h3>Winter Scene</h3>
<p>— Bei Hua</p>
<p>The night is so long...</p>
<p>The river surface is silent. The water reflects a silvery-gray light, rippling and making faint sounds. Ships are anchored in the middle of the river like monsters, their black smokestacks obscuring half the moon, casting large shadows. The road in front of the Jianghai Customs House, except for the occasional passing car or two, shows little sign of life. Facing the Great Clock Tower, the patrolling police officer sighs.</p>
<p>In the misty air, his drowsy eyes seem to see something—yes, he sees his wife at home, her affectionate, almond-shaped eyes wide open, lying in bed waiting for his return. And his son's little face, so sweetly dreaming. He has a warm home, yet he stands here, facing the biting river wind.</p>
<p>The wind, carrying whispers from the fields of Pudong, blows past the shoulders of the God of Peace. In the wind's whistling, he finally wakes up. He looks up at the time: the Great Clock Tower is striking half past three.</p>
<p>The chime awakens a homeless child who has been dozing off in a corner of the warehouse. Rubbing his eyes, he feels cold and finds it impossible to fall back asleep. He nudges Xiao Liu Zi next to him, but the boy remains half-dead, unresponsive. Just then, his keen senses tell him that someone is approaching—the footsteps are getting closer and clearer. So he slaps Xiao Liu Zi hard! "The police are coming!" he shouts, grabbing Xiao Liu Zi and running away.</p>
<p>The world is vast, yet they have nowhere to rest. Under the pale lights outside the park, these two small souls have dark, gaunt faces. Hunger and cold make them shiver. How can their tattered and thin clothes withstand the cold of this late November night?</p>
<p>This is the time when people who enjoy pleasure and those who are used for pleasure are riding home in cars to rest. "Let's go to the bridge over there and make a few cents to buy flatbread tomorrow!" Xiao Liu Zi says. It took a lot of hard work for them to get the chance to pull rickshaws at the bridge; now, it has become their only means of survival. As they walk, they stare at the black water of the Suzhou Creek, their small hearts frozen cold.</p>
<p>On this side of the bridge, they wait for customers to take them to the other side, earning one or two copper coins from the late-night travelers, which they pocket in their half-torn clothes. No one shows them any sympathy, in this world where everyone lacks a sympathetic heart. A young dancer, emerging from a nightclub into the cold night, sits in a rickshaw and relaxes her body, sore from being embraced. She has no time to spare for Xiao Liu Zi. A drunken sailor, with his hat askew, covering one eye, laughs inexplicably. Xiao Liu Zi has no choice but to hide to the side, feeling sorry for the rickshaw puller struggling under the sailor's boots. A prostitute with an unusually ugly face, unable to find any customers, stands blankly on the bridge, looking at the sky and then at the river, as if unable to find a place to go, whether it be heaven or hell...</p>
<p>The night is so long; it seems like dawn will never come, and the cold intensifies.</p>
<p>The frost on the roofs will not melt until the sun rises tomorrow. The power lines and streetlights accompany the loneliness of the city. In the distance, around the corner, it seems someone is walking by, the sound of footsteps breaking the silence of the street. The sleeping city, wake up!</p>
<h3>The Shoe-Shining Boy</h3>
<p>— Lin Na</p>
<p>(A Manila Story)</p>
<p>It was a clear morning. Heavy trucks had already begun to rumble down the dusty, coal-reeking asphalt road. Xi Luo, a homeless child, was just waking up from a slumber on a cement bench in the First Municipal Park. He gently opened his dry, weary eyes, the soft sunlight piercing them, causing him to blink constantly. He thought: It's late! Damn it..., and then he hurriedly got off the cement bench, using his dirty sleeve to wipe the sleep from his eyes and the dew from his face. Suddenly, he felt a strange noise in his stomach and realized he was hungry.</p>
<p>Just then, the monotonous cough of the park keeper, old Ling Luo, echoed dully from under a row of plane trees. Feeling uneasy and frightened, he quickly grabbed his small wooden stool and wooden box, hidden under the cement bench, stood up, and tried to run along the path leading to the street. But before he could take a step, he heard the park keeper, old Ling Luo, shout his familiar, fierce, and slightly hoarse command:</p>
<p>"Stop right there, you little brat!"</p>
<p>As soon as he turned his head, the park keeper's rough wooden stick flashed in the soft sunlight. Trembling slightly, he forgot his usual habit of making faces or sticking out his tongue at the park keeper, and instead took off running towards the exit.</p>
<p>The streets were crowded with office workers and factory workers with worried faces. Shiny cars honked loudly in the middle of the street and sped away, while horses pulling broken carriages snorted and whinnied, raised their tails, and kicked their hind legs, but when the angry drivers whipped them hard on their backs, they stood still and silent.</p>
<p>Xi Luo was now lost in the crowd. He felt terribly tired and depressed, and almost stumbled on the sidewalk several times, but thanks to God's grace, he was pushed along by the hurrying pedestrians. His head was heavy and muddled, and he couldn't help but think of things from a few years ago.</p>
<p>It was an unsettling June day. Manila was rife with cholera. His father, a coachman, came home early one day, complaining of a headache, and died three days later. His mother also caught the infection and died the day after his father. Thus, twelve-year-old Xi Luo became an orphan. The fifty-two-year-old Mrs. Moro, who lived next door, said she was doing it for God's sake, and limped around, begging his close and distant neighbors, saying:</p>
<p>"For the sake of the merciful God, save this homeless orphan..."</p>
<p>The elderly coachman, Fu Xi, generously took out money from his shriveled pouch and donated it. Then everyone else donated too. So Mrs. Moro prepared a small wooden stool and a black wooden box (which contained brushes, shoe polish, and rags) for him and told him to go out into the streets to shine shoes for people and make a living.</p>
<p>And now? His home, Mrs. Moro, in the name of God, had moved into, with her eight-year-old child. He was now forced to retreat to the First Municipal Park to spend the night…</p>
<p>He slowly walked along Rosario Avenue, then turned into Brooke Square. However, not a single customer called out to him, "Xi Luo, come here!" Then an American gentleman in a suit gestured for him to come over. He hurriedly agreed and ran across.</p>
<p>Now, the American gentleman sat on his little wooden stool, his legs stretched straight out on his black wooden box, smoking a cigar contentedly. And Xi Luo knelt in front of him, carefully applying shoe polish, brushing, and shining his shoes. Gradually, the dirty shoes became shiny and gleaming. The American gentleman, satisfied, took the cigar butt from his mouth and threw it on the ground, where another person immediately picked it up and put it in his mouth. Xi Luo knelt in front of him, looking up and wiping the sweat from his face with his dirty sleeve. He was very happy, because he would soon have a full breakfast.</p>
<p>A tram rumbled loudly from afar and stopped at the station. The American gentleman proudly stepped onto the tram, but forgot to pay Xi Luo for shining his shoes. Xi Luo was shocked.</p>
<p>"Sir, you forgot, the money for shining the shoes!"</p>
<p>But before he could react, he was kicked hard in his skinny butt by the shiny shoe tip. He stumbled backward, still wanting to chase after him, but the tram had already rumbled away, leaving behind a contemptuous burst of laughter in the coal-reeking air. One of his compatriots even stuck a slick, oily head out of the window and cursed him harshly.</p>
<p>"You little wretch, serves you right!"</p>
<p>"Serves me right? I earned it with my own strength!" Xi Luo thought, and sadly took his little wooden stool and black wooden box to a quiet place, where he cried secretly.</p>
<h3>Goddess</h3>
<p>— Jiang Mi</p>
<p>The two fighting dogs, Zhuanxu and Gonggong, were fighting to become the leader, to be revered in the south, and they argued there, one saying: I am a man ordained by heaven, God specially ordered me to unify the world! One said: I don't know what to boast about heaven and earth, I just want to be the emperor following my heart. These two fighting dogs, both holding the determination that there can be only one sun in the sky and only one emperor among the people, the result of the roar is, of course, to use force to compete in length.

<p>Today, oh, only today can I still endure the torment of this pain. Tomorrow, oh, tomorrow my voice will be ruined, my flesh will rot, and then I will be useless coal ash, abandoned in a desolate wilderness. Born of the same parents, but divided into rich and poor, the rich enjoy glory and fortune, the poor sell themselves into brothels, suffering endless beatings and hunger, enduring endless shame and torment. With my hoarse voice, with my broken body, I cater to the wandering wealthy men, and earn flesh and blood money for the greedy madam. Today, oh, only today can I still endure the torment of this pain. Tomorrow, oh, tomorrow my voice will be ruined, my flesh will rot, and then I will be useless coal ash, abandoned in a desolate wilderness.</p>

<h3>Ballad Singing</h3>
<p>Cheng Fangzhou Li Liansun Mao Jiashu</p>
<p>Huamei (1060) 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening: Talent and Sentiment</p>
<p>One point of talent, one point of sentiment, the higher the talent, the deeper the sentiment. All beautiful women pity talented men. Talented men have always loved beauties. However, there is one more hateful thing. Why? The length of sentiment is not even. Want to change sentiment, it didn't start today. There were many deliberate people in the beginning. Some are chaotic in the beginning and abandoned in the end. Some become enemies first and then become married. One knows that Li Yi is heartless and forgets the former agreement. Wang Kui is ungrateful and mistakes the former alliance. One cannot learn from Song Hong who does not abandon his wife. One cannot learn from Princess Liu Chang who does not remarry. It is not that human feelings are divided into thick and thin, it is only because talent is shallow and talent is deep. One knows that dreams of willows are all good matches. Poems written on leaves are also marriages. It is laughable that the world is confused and considers stealing jade and stealing fragrance as proper. Calculate the truth of dewy couples. What is the etiquette of fighting for love and jealousy? Only causes trouble and is not peaceful. However. It is hard to avoid the matter of amorous feelings. All have friendships that are mistaken by a few points. Call to amuse the emotions and amuse the emotions.</p>
<p>Xia Hesheng Three Smiles</p>
<p>Dunben (800) 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM</p>
<p>Opening: Herding Sheep Scroll</p>
<p>With the success of destroying the bandits, he returned home in brocade clothes. Zhu Chundeng was ordered to return to his hometown. Who knew? He could not see the faces of his kind mother and wife. He hurried to call his aunt to ask about his behavior. A very quick-witted woman. Talked about a pair of mother-in-law and daughter-in-law going to the Springs. Hearing the words, it was like being struck by thunder. Crying and breaking his intestines, he felt full of hatred. Open the grave to mourn and help the poor. Transcend the dead soul to do good deeds. Who knew? The mother-in-law and daughter-in-law are still in the world. They have been avoiding the deep mountains. The shepherds live with the sheep. Looking at the family, they dare not return home. Containing tears, they endure the same food. The husband and wife met at the grave. Looking at the eyebrows. Everyone guesses. A series of questions should be right. Only then did I know that my aunt's conscience was hurt. Crying and pulling Xuan Tang, the tears did not dry. Changing clothes on the spot becomes an edict. Sweetness comes after suffering. The evil woman is now anxious. Kneel in the center to swear to clear up doubts. Who knows. Before the oath was over, the dragon arrived. In an instant, the bones turned to ashes. One's own evil cannot be violated.</p>

<h3>Lotus Film Snippets</h3>
<p>The soon-to-be-released "Filial Piety" has indeed garnered immense attention from people nationwide and theaters everywhere. The reason for this lies in the outstanding performances of its many excellent actors and the proven track records of its director and screenwriter.</p>
<p>Cai Chusheng's new work, "The Lost Lamb," is currently filming its model scenes on a grand scale. However, this model is neither a beauty emerging from a bath nor a nude exercise; rather, it's a group of homeless, impoverished children nakedly drying their clothes by a fire on a rainy night.</p>
<p>"Wild Geese Descending on the Sandy Banks" can be described as an unparalleled tragedy. When Chang Ma and Xu Weibang's "Pear Blossoms in a Rainstorm" was premiered, many praised its refined and unconventional style. Seeing "Wild Geese Descending on the Sandy Banks" today, it is even more filled with poetic and artistic flair, and its poignant and sorrowful aspects are even more pronounced than the previous film.</p>
<p>Yang Xiaozhong's new script, "Wildcat," has been completed.</p>
<p>To act in a way that one naturally sheds tears during a sad scene is inherently difficult. Among Chinese actors, only a few can achieve this. Wang Hanlun, who had been away from the silver screen for a long time, recently filmed a tragic scene for "Tears on the Faded Red." Ms. Hanlun actually burst into tears, crying so sorrowfully that it truly moved people's hearts.</p>
<p>Han Langan has taken a ten-day leave of absence to return home. As a result, "Three Modern Men" only has two modern men working on the set.</p>
<p>Fei Mu's work, "Fragrant Snow Sea," is being dubbed and prepared for release in France due to demand from French theaters. All musical arrangements and necessary textual preparations have been completed and will be sent abroad within days. The music for the film is entirely Eastern in style.</p>
<p>Hong Jingling is famous for playing insidious characters. Recently, he was borrowed by Xinhua Company to film a movie. It is said that Liu Jiqun mentioned that Lianhua and Xinhua have a contract stipulating that after use, he must be returned intact, without damage.</p>
<p>"Little Angel" is now being reprinted in small film format by the Jiangsu Provincial Government for screening by educational groups in various counties. The essay contest initiated by Lianhua has concluded and is currently in the judging process.</p>
<p>In "Song of a Loving Mother," Ge Zuoqia plays Jin Yan's childhood, while Chen Yanyan's childhood is played by Chen Juanjuan.</p>
<p>The work on "Going to Nature" is extremely intense. The newly completed No. 3 studio is fully occupied with the film's sets. The outdoor studio is dominated by the film's grand desert island scenery. Anyone passing by the Xietu Road on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road can see this mountain island standing tall from afar.</p>
<p>Fei Mu is engaged in preparations for filming "Childhood China." Fei Mu recently said to people, "I hope to make this film more watchable."</p>
<p>Shen Fu, playing Shen Cihang in "The Lost Lamb," has a scene where he is drunk and falls into the water. It will be filmed soon. Because Shen is not good at swimming and the weather is cold, he is extremely apprehensive due to the "double dilemma." Director Cai Chusheng often speaks sternly to him, and Shen says, "I only hope I can float and not sink."</p>
<h3>Silver Jottings</h3>
<p>—Zhi Er</p>
<p>Lan Ping, who has no roles in "Resurrection," is currently suffering from poverty and illness.</p>
<p>Rumor has it: Diantong will suspend operations for three days after filming "Streets and Alleys" to reorganize.</p>
<p>Or it is rumored: Seeing that Diantong had already come to a standstill, even "Streets and Alleys" has temporarily suspended filming.</p>
<p>Some, declaring themselves not paranoid, predict that Yuan Muzhi will return to Diantong in three months. The position of director of the General Affairs Department will definitely be Zhao Bangying, not Zhou Bozhu.</p>
<p>Saying that Ma Dejian is discouraged is not as accurate as saying that Zhao Bangying is discouraged. The two are essentially one and the same. Or it could be said that neither of them is truly discouraged, because Zhao Bangying's discouragement is motivated, while Ma Dejian's discouragement is out of feeling. "Heaven fears the east wind, people fear the bedside ghost." Similarly, film company owners also fear close confidants who constantly say things aren't going well.</p>
<p>Anyone who can work at a film company for three years will not fear being squeezed out anywhere else. The statement may be exaggerated, but it contains some truth.</p>
<p>Alas, the truth.</p>
<h3>"Clouds Over Abyssinia" Premieres</h3>
<p>—Abyssinia's Strange Customs and Exotic Scenes All Captured on Film—</p>
<p>The long-awaited topical and realistic epic "Wings Over Ethiopia" has been scheduled to premiere at the Grand Theater today. The film's content, concerning Abyssinia, can be said to depict everything from modern to ancient warfare, from civilized to savage regions. All the strange customs and exotic scenes of Abyssinia are captured in the film. The most peculiar and interesting is a special custom of the natives in southern Abyssinia: a woman can have one husband and five lovers. On the fifth day after the wedding, the groom must leave his room, allowing the bride's first lover to enter. When the husband sleeps at home, he must place his long spear in front of the door to indicate that someone is inside, preventing others from intruding. In short, those who care about world affairs should appreciate this work.</p>
<h3>"Star Semi-Monthly" Boat Girl Special Edition Published</h3>

<h3>An Exploration of Ancient Bath Garden Architecture (Part 1)</h3>
<p>—Sun Zongwen</p>
<p>—One of the Crystallizations of Roman National Architectural Art—</p>
<p>"Bath Garden Architecture" (Thermae Architecture) is a seemingly unfamiliar term; although it is also an artwork among the world's buildings. The reason why it is not generally noticed by people is due to two factors: First, in terms of history: Because architecture is a "historical record"; so the appearance of a certain type of building is sufficient to represent the prosperity of this country and the characteristics of its people; so it can be said that it is a crystallization of the times, environment, and national character. Throughout history, both in China and abroad, the thing that mankind is most affected by is religion? Therefore, the most magnificent and splendid buildings, and the ones that people most like to build, are also "religious buildings." Let's look! From the beginning of the world until today, which period of time has the general public not devoted themselves to religious buildings? Since the pyramids, which have existed for thousands of years, there have been the mysterious temples of ancient Egypt, the magnificent temples of Greece, the solemn temples of Rome, and the great and quiet Christian churches of modern times; countless religious buildings have appeared in the world! And what is even stranger is that our architectural art seems to be a substitute for religious art, because every part of it symbolizes religious spiritual meaning. The reason is that in the past history, the greatest force influencing design was religion. We have proven that architecture is a "historical record," so the center of a world architectural history is based on religious architecture; and the "bath garden architecture" that we are talking about now has nothing to do with religion, so it is no wonder that it is ignored by the general public. Second, in terms of art; the world's architecture is centered on religion, so artistic skills are particularly focused on religious buildings. "Bath gardens" are a niche thing, and few great and impressive masterpieces have appeared since ancient times, so they contribute little to art itself; as a result, those who study architectural art in the world have reduced their interest in it; the result is that it has become a not very important material, left in our architectural history.</p>
<p>Since bath gardens are not important buildings, then why should we study them? That's right, modern bath gardens are not worth exploring; but ancient bath gardens are really worth studying. In ancient times, there were bath gardens that were as magnificent as palaces, as mysterious as temples, and as splendid as shrines, and perhaps even more precious, more beautiful, and more delicate works than religious buildings! Where are these crystallizations of art hidden? Then we can say without thinking: "Beautiful Rome." Okay, let's take the bath garden architectural art of Rome as the focus of our exploration!</p>
<p>Roman culture, although inherited from Greek culture, also has different aspects; because Romans are a practical nation. Their imagination is far less abundant than that of the Greeks, but their calm, composed, and common-sense minds are one of the characteristics of their national character; and Romans are rich in public nature, so public buildings are particularly developed. Public hygiene was also advanced at that time; therefore, bath garden architecture appeared in various places one after another. The Roman era can be said to be the golden age of "bath garden architecture"; its exquisite techniques and beautiful art are no less than the "temples" of Greece; moreover, it is one of the crystallizations of Roman national architectural art!</p>
<p>Romans especially value obedience, so they are particularly obedient to their emperors; they believe that the emperor's power is greater than everything, therefore, the palace buildings in various places are particularly grand and magnificent. As bath gardens are subsidiary buildings of palaces, the construction of bath gardens also flourished accordingly; this is one of the reasons why bath gardens developed. The beginning of bath gardens can be traced back to Egypt; however, the scale was rudimentary. By the time the Greek city government opened, people's living standards improved, and society paid attention to hygiene, bath gardens were strongly promoted; when Rome rose, bath gardens can be regarded as the true construction period, because many great masterpieces appeared one after another at that time, especially during the reign of Emperor Nero (Nero), the grand scale of its bath gardens, the materials collected from all countries, and the craftsmanship exhausted by all craftsmen, were sufficient to represent the honor of the Roman Empire. I remember there was a movie called "Romance in the Palace"; several interior scenes were bath gardens of the imperial palace. The splendor of the set and the exquisiteness of the carvings were truly breathtaking. From the screen, we can also imagine a glimpse of the architectural art of bath gardens at that time. Although Europeans and Americans today pay attention to skills, when they see the port gardens of Rome, they will probably be amazed!</p>
<h3>How to Utilize a House</h3>
<p>—Written by Qian Zhenjie, Translated by Zhang Guangzheng</p>
<p>A house is a container for life. However, the family life within this container is constantly changing. For example, as time progresses, the head of the household changes. If the family's income increases, it will lead to an increase in interests and hobbies. Regarding the house, there will often be requests for the establishment or separation of children's rooms and the father's study.</p>
<p>Therefore, even if the house was built under extremely thorough planning, after a period of time, it will naturally feel insufficient to use. Moreover, most of the salary earners nowadays live in rented houses. The inconvenience they feel in their daily lives can be imagined.</p>
<p>However, once a house is built, it becomes real estate. The only procedures required after that are maintenance. However, when tenants move out, most landlords are afraid of the trouble of compensating for these maintenance and repair costs, so they are unwilling to allow tenants to modify the house at will, and often impose restrictions on this point. Due to these reasons, even if one wants to modify the unsatisfactory parts to adapt to one's life and achieve a more comfortable degree, it is impossible.</p>
<p>In this way, within the scope where remodeling or major repairs are impossible, is there no more clever way to live? The following are simple methods of living in a house comfortably and well without spending a lot of money, relying only on good arrangement.</p>
<p>(1) The Locking Style of the Doorway</p>
<p>In order to prevent accidents, it is best to install a Western-style door. Open a small hole in a part of the door panel or wall, install glass to act as a peephole, and it is best to cover it with a thin and beautiful silk cloth on the inside. After seeing who the visitor is through this look, one can open the door and welcome them in with peace of mind.</p>
<p>Next, regarding locks. If the door style is single-leaf, there is a type called a "positive lock." Fasten the center of the handle to the side, lower the key from the inside, and it will be difficult to open from the outside. The handling method is also extremely convenient, as long as one takes it along when entering or exiting, the outside will not be pushed open.</p>
<p>There is also a type called a safety lock, which has the advantage that it is not easy to open from the outside. And the opening of the door has a certain width. The lock is made of gold. Many households in New York use it.</p>
<p>(2) Install Screens</p>
<p>In new construction areas, mosquitoes fly in swarms every summer night, which is extremely annoying. If fine wire mesh is installed on the window, it can be prevented. If so, one can both enjoy the cool breeze of summer nights and defend against mosquito attacks. And the installation cost is not high, and the benefits are very considerable. Made into a screen frame, it is easy to remove when not in use.</p>
<p>Also, if the house has shutters and glass windows, replacing the glass windows with screens can also achieve the above purpose.</p>
<p>(3) Improving Kitchen Efficiency</p>
<p>In the kitchen, cover the gas appliances and stove equipment used for cooking with a lead-skin cover, lead it to the chimney, and install a ventilation fan at the end to remove odors outdoors. If a small electric fan is installed, the ventilation effect can be good.</p>
<p>Fish bones, meat bones, vegetable scraps, and other waste are very troublesome to handle, finely broken, and very easy to contaminate the kitchen. Use a lead pipe inclined from the inside of the kitchen, through the wall, to the outside. First, prepare a large bucket to collect waste, and pour it from the pipe from time to time. This is also a better way.</p>
<p>(4) Washroom, Bathroom, and Toilet</p>
<p>Houses with specially built washrooms are mostly quite complete. As for general small residences, most people use the kitchen for washing their faces every morning. However, it is unclean and inconvenient to use the place where tableware and food are handled. Therefore, it is best to set up washing utensils in a corner of the bathroom. If the bathroom is not equipped or is small, it is best to set up washing utensils next to the water pipe at one end of the outer corridor. It is very simple and not unsightly. Especially for developing children's habit of washing hands before meals, it is more suitable.</p>
<p>Hang a cloth bag of the same color as the wall on the bathroom wall, which can be used to place toothbrushes, toothpaste, soap, etc., which is also very suitable.</p>
<p>If the toilet is three to five square feet wide, a shelf that can hold flower pots, bouquets, and incense burners can be placed in one corner. In this way, the unclean place will be changed into a better and more pleasant place. The fragrance is hated by flies, so it can also drive away a lot of flies.</p>
<p>(5) Study and Children's Room</p>
<p>To effectively use a small study, it is not wrong to put more bookshelves. Just make sure that the books can be arranged in an orderly manner without hindering the opening and closing of the door and access.</p>
<p>As for children's rooms, the furnishings are best simple and constantly changing. At the entrance, set up a larger wall mirror and washing utensils to cultivate children's cleanliness habits. Indeed, children's moving sand and carrying stones, dragging mud and water, often make the interior of the house unclean. But this is the nature of children's activity, and it is not a matter of being too forced.</p>
<p>(6) Utilization Under the Eaves</p>
<p>The southeast-facing window is the best way for sunlight to enter the house in one day, so try to make it as spacious as possible. And most new-style houses have windows open in this direction. In summer, it can introduce cool breezes, and in winter, it can avoid direct cold winds and maintain an appropriate temperature. On the contrary, the best thing under the eaves facing northwest is to plant some flowers and trees, which can make the environment more beautiful.</p>
<h3>Factory Building Design (Part 2)</h3>
<p>—Bo Ping</p>
<p>(1) Speaking of single-story buildings, they occupy the largest area. If it were in Shanghai, where land prices are extremely high, it would be immediately uneconomical. However, because their structures are interconnected, once one part is completed, it can be sent to the second part. In this way, manufacturing is very procedural, easy to manage, and the light is always relatively sufficient, and the air is also very fresh.</p>
<p>(2) Multi-story! Because land prices are too expensive, our factory buildings have several or even dozens of floors. In this way, there are more workplaces, but boilers, engines, etc., must be placed on the first floor to avoid danger. The upper floors are only suitable for light work.</p>
<p>(3) Large-span type! This type of building is most suitable for factories with many workers, such as ironworking, etc.</p>
<p>(4) Separate type - It is best to separate the buildings of dangerous factories part by part, because if one room has a danger, it will avoid affecting other parts, such as gunpowder factories and match factories, etc.</p>
<p>(3) Choice of Materials</p>
<p>In modern factory construction, safety is the main design consideration. Therefore, countries have certain regulations on the materials for factory construction. The commonly used ones include wood, stone, iron, and reinforced concrete:</p>
<p>(1) Wood - Not very strong, but the price is extremely cheap, construction is rapid, easy to repair, and many factories that are short-term and have no dangers are happy to use it.</p>
<p>(2) Stone - Does not catch fire, has extremely strong resistance, but transportation is not easy, depending on the distance of local stone production.</p>
<p>(3) Iron - Iron-style buildings are rare in China. It is certainly not easy to catch fire, but it is very easy to conduct heat. Its advantage is that construction is rapid and repairs are few.</p>
<p>(4) Reinforced concrete is the latest type of building material. In addition to being solid, it is not easy to catch fire and does not require repairs, but the price is a bit too expensive.</p>
<p>(4) Light Design</p>
<p>The design of light is also very important. It is best to use natural sunlight. Therefore, the design of the roof and skylights should be carefully considered. The design of the roof is for this purpose. The common one used is the sawtooth roof. When it comes to the design of windows, it is necessary to ensure (1) sufficient light that is spread throughout the room, (2) avoid direct sunlight, so that there is reflected light.</p>
<p>(5) Safety Equipment Design</p>
<p>(1) Emergency exit - Each building should have three to five emergency exits according to building regulations. The door can be opened outward with a single push.</p>
<p>(2) Fire buckets - Five to ten fire buckets are fully stored with water.</p>
<p>(3) Fire escape - This is necessary for multi-story buildings.</p>
