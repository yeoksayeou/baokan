<p>時評</p>
<h3>所得稅與義敎秉</h3>
<p>上月報載。所得稅原則及應課應免之稅率範圍。均經稅則委員會規定。現正在中央審查中。並聞所得稅之徵收。决於明年元旦日開始實行。雖二十四年度總預算歲入部分列所得稅之數。僅五百萬元。但預計是項收入。每年實有二千萬元云。夫所得稅。之為良稅略窺計學門徑者類能言之。使經濟上確有擔負能力之國民咸對國家盡其義務。於情至允。於理至公。又復不取比例制而採累進制。足以節制投機壟斷者之奇贏。而劑貧富於不甚懸殊之境。是實有效之社會政策。宜為具有公民觀念之國民所贊許。雖徵收方法。途徑非一。抉擇弗愼卽滋流弊。國情特殊。異於他邦。審度弗周立見罅漏。然我人雅不欲作因噎廢食之論。惟期當局者為妥帖精詳之謀。他日流弊無聞罅漏無見。納稅者皆欣欣然有喜色而相吿曰。「是誠良稅也凡我人之所納。一　一銖。胥歸於至當之途。用盡其量。罔或　糜。是誠良稅也。」則亦足以誇行政之效率慰徵稅之初意矣。</p>
<p>由前之說。所調良稅者自其。用意甚善。立法至公而言。而猶不北此也。必就其用途觀之。取之當而用之亦當。然後謚為良稅。庶無遺憾。設或一方徵收所得稅而一方並不計劃正當之用途徒以賽駢枝之機關充無益之浮費。則其為良稅。殆將人人而致疑之矣。我國方事建設。百端待舉。但患無源源之收入。决。不愁無正當之用途。始每年二千萬元之稅欵。將分配於何種急要之事業。俾收最大之功能。端在當局者之炯眼朗照。通盤籌算。而我人今所欲言者。卽義務教育之推行。宜得此欵以為助力也。</p>
<p>義教之必需推行。其故甚明。無俟疏說教部今規定推行步驟為三期。自本年八月始。推廣短期小學。漸進而至民國三十三年八月。始臻於四年制之義務教育。其所以不求一蹴而至。雖有師資不敷設備不及等原因。要以經費不給為主。卽就今開始時期而言。據教部雷震君之播音演講。謂各省市呈報實施計劃。約需經費一千八百萬元以上。各省自籌。預計可得九百萬元。中央補助。本年度確定為二百四十萬元。又據最近消息。中英中美中法三庚欵機關决定撥補助費二十萬元。出納相抵仍。尙不足六百餘萬元。夫各省自籌九百萬元。僅預計耳。實現與否未。可必卽令實現。必已滿頭大汗。甚費氣力。而况義教之推行也以漸進。明年之所需。自必加甚於今年。時移歲遷。其將更形竭蹶。不難想。見苟此不足之數終無術彌補。非特第三期之完成。斷難如期卽第一期之功績。亦且折扣。此大可注意者也。</p>
<p>查二十四年度總預算。其義教費二百四十萬元。係屬特增之教育經費。當各事求其撙節之際。而此項乃得特　。中央之重視義教。有貫澈計劃之决心。已可概見。顧不足之數。猶在二倍以上。倘所得稅之收入不充別用。取為挹注。假令年有二千萬元。則彌補不足而外。尙綽有餘裕。卽如總預算所列。僅有五百萬。亦復相差無幾。所得稅取之至公。義教費用之至溥。以此應彼。則義教之推行。經費方面已少阻障。而所得稅之為良稅益覺不虛矣。</p>
<h3>國聯全體大會　對意阿爭議　英外相闡明立塲　就能力範圍旅行盟約義務　擁護集體安全制保障和平　我代表痛言國聯已往失敗</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）英外相霍爾今日對國聯大會會議說明英國對意阿爭議之度、其扼要語為英國不遜於他國、欲在　能力範圍內履行國聯盟約加諸英國之義務、霍爾開始發言時、為午前十一時十二分、會塲人甚擁擠、霍爾聲稱、苟謂英國之動機、非為對於國聯之忠貞、但為一種卑下的目的、或謂英國縱有此忠貞、但亦不可恃、則此說實屬不公允而有危險性的誤會、須知英政府之態度、始終忠於國聯、卽在今日依然如故、英國輿論巳表示國人如何贊助政府完全接受其國聯會員之義務、以此為共外交政策之主旨矣、</p>
<p>集體安全含議廣泛</p>
<p>集體安全乃一種繁複見　、其所含之意義、較所謂、裁者為多、蓋不獨盟約第十六條、卽盟約全部與夫各種條約義務之尊重、無不包括在內也、其所根據者、為衆所承　的基木義務、此義務　何卽一招國聯盟約　載置手續用和平方法解决爭　是也、如會員國有不應盟約而訢諸戰爭者、卽最後有集體行動以制止戰爭之義務在焉、盟約義務如須擔任、則必須集合擔任之、多數之安全、不能專賴少數人之努力而獲保障、必須有所作為、以袪除戰爭易起之原因、又必須覓取舍戰爭而外之方法、以整理國際力量之天然表演、惟要求改變之公道、未必與國民情感相　合、蓋國民情戚乃被敲起以擁護此要求者、且共所需要之改變、亦常常足以造成更多之不公道、甚於其所欲袪除者、此種改變必俟時機成熟時為之而不可於未　熟時為之、更不可用片面行動或用戰爭威脅為之、此種國際事件中少定例如欲成立、而為人公認、國聯會員必須注意及此、及其他安全辦法云</p>
<p>願共開發世界富源</p>
<p>霍爾承認英國之誠意與思想、起於開明的自利觀念、並舉善用世界利源之可能性為證、又謂以殖民地原料而言、目前事態、容可引起專利行將成立而有損於未有殖民的國家之惶恐、此種惶恐誠不免侈言過甚、而含有他種作用、惟吾人若置諸不理、則未免不智、英國固準備參加此種事件之調查也、吾人確信各國對於人類、皆可作有價值之貢獻、而進步落後之國、無礙其獨立與土地完整、亦得期望前進國家助其發展利源、而造成其國家生活云、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）英外相霍爾有國聯大會會議致詞之初、謂余非謂有國聯大會歷史中有較今日更難發言與討論之時期、當此世界對於意阿爭議羣情驚惶之際、言論稍一不愼、易使時局更為嚴重、國聯工作、更為困難、國聯在成立之初、卽有若干强國未曾加入、此后又有數國出惠、普遍性之缺乏、當然引起一種不寧之元素、而使國聯維持和平之工作、是否可依賴全世界之贊助、發生疑問、吾人之議席已多空虛、不欲再由虛席云、十一日路透電）</p>
<p>經濟較政治尤重要</p>
<p>霍爾至此、乃提出結論、謂經濟問題實較政治問題尤為重要、英國政府現準備與各國會同研究世界富源、與各委任統治地重行分配方法、幷立稱英國政府對於國聯會、實仍保持忠實態度云云、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>我顏代表繼起發言　贊助集體安全制度</p>
<p>（日內瓦）今晨國聯會大會舉行會議時、英國代表卽該國外相霍爾發表演說之後、中國代表顏惠慶博士卽繼起發言云、國聯會中堅計有三十國之多、均知世界和平能否加以維護、當視國聯會能否獲得新生命以為斷此點實堪欣幸國聯會若因振其威權而冉度失敗、則其效率、卽世界和平所由以維繫者靡有孑遺、往者各國曾在日內瓦倫敦羅馬斯德萊柴莫斯科各處簽訂種種恊定、均足以增進集體安全、國聯會因而成為安全保障之別名、任何會員國不論其為强為弱、凡遭遇其他會員國或非會員國之侵略者國聯會均當出而維護之、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>國聯組織具世界性　不當忽視非歐事件</p>
<p>顏氏旋對於各國政治家過分重視歐洲事件、而忽略非歐洲事件加以非議、謂一般入以為遠處所可發生之事變對於歐洲關係較為微小、此種觀念實非眞確、流弊所至可使國際衝突相繼而生、抑知國聯會組織、必當具有世界性、世界任何地方、往昔發生戰爭之處、國聯會雖曾出而干涉、但因缺乏勇氣之故、對於違反盟約各項原則之國、未能强其就範、因而歸於失敗至中國人民酷愛和平仍堅决以國聯會為歸宿並準　與各國合作、以促進集體安全制度、英國外相霍爾有云、自東徂西各國均當合作、俾促成中國之穩定與進步、余對此說完全同意、要知繁榮與强盛之中國、對於全世界實具有重大關係云云、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>對日德何懦弱乃爾</p>
<p>（日內瓦）此間意人對於央外相霍爾今日在國聯大會會議中所發之演說、咸其痛苦之印象、某意員詢問路透訪員曰、「英國曷為對待老友之意國、如此强硬、而對待德日兩國、則何懦弱乃爾」、某有名法國評論家聲稱、渠意英外相此次演說、實為日內瓦歷來所聞最有聲色者之一、令人回憶已故寇松勳爵之時代、英國已由其深謀遠慮中露其面目、而復為外交中不可爭辯之領袖云、（十日路透電）</p>
<h3>英法談話和洽</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）官方宜稱、賴伐爾與霍爾昨晚舉行第二次談話、歷一小時、再度表示雙方之和洽及友善精神、關於討論之事項、則消息靈通方面稱、意阿爭議之全部事實均在詳細討論之中、但尙未有何决定、法國方面盛傳英政府决心援引盟約第十六條、但英國代表團以為對意談判尙未結束、對於此項謠言不欲發表任何聲明、（十一日國民電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）聞法國頗以明日英外相將在國聯大曾所發演說引起之影響為慮、聞賴伐爾巳勸請和緩立言、深恐英外相率直之官言、將迫意國退出國聯也、據法人方面消息、英外相與賴氏會談時、切實聲明英國注重集體安全制、並擬維護國聯不使失敗、此舉關係恭重云、（十日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）事業報推測賴伐爾之意向、謂一賴伐爾已擬有一種新建議本日午後賴氏將先與霍爾會談、然後再行會晤意國首席代表阿洛錫、而向意國提出此項新建議、據吾人所知、賴伐爾對於爭端之和平解决、並未保有何種希望、但為良心所驅使、故不得不作最後交涉、彼將設法先使英國承認意國軍事佔領阿比西尼亞之可能性、然此則固為英國內閣所不願聞者也、倘英國對於此點能作最後之讓步、則賴伐爾方可根據此種讓步、以向意大利有所提議」云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>五人特委會　調解陷於僵局　意代表態度强硬　定下週二集議</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）五人特委會因意總代表阿洛錫能度强硬、今日已陷於僵局、特委會今晨集議、聆主席瑪逹里亞迦報吿興阿洛錫談話之經過、此項報吿全屬消極的、因意代表之態度絕對强硬、毫不讓步、故瑪氏不能獰得意代表之任何意見或鼓勵、特委會處此情勢、乃决議今淮行探討實屬無益、俟審查意國申責阿國不配為國聯會員之備忘錄之小組委員會提出報吿書後、再定進行方計、該報吿書在後三十六小時內可望提出、苟無意外之事端發生、則特委會星期四日將再集議、草擬致行政院之報吿書、臚舉諸委員之意見、衆信此項意見、將不外乎國聯盟約第十五條所規定之「建議」、特委會會議之際、從未越出巴黎三國會議所提出建議之範圍、並未議及軍事與政治統制建議、其談話迥旋於集體的與經濟的對阿扶助問題、衆覺該會絕少商决任何調解方法之希望、（十日路透電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）此間政界人士對於處理意阿爭端五國小組委員會之前途、頗抱悲觀、哈瓦斯社記者頃探悉小組委員會中若干代表、對於該委員會是否尙能繼續進行和解工作、深致疑盧、則以小組委員會主席西班牙代表瑪德里加迭次與意國代表阿洛錫舉行談話、輒感意國方面缺乏合作精神故也、聞阿洛錫、始終保持消極態度、拒絕提出意國之最後要求、因此據消息靈通方面所稱、英國不管部大臣艾登曾向小組委員會提議、小組委員會僅紀錄因意國態度缺乏合作精神、致委員會不克履行其任務、如是則小組委員會卽可卸資、反之、法國總理兼外長賴伐爾則堅主小組委員會應繼續進行和解工作、勿作忽促之决定、必俟一切足以促成雙方接近之企圖完全用盡以後、方可有此種决定云、小組委員會議結果、則已採取賴伐爾之主張、决定小組委員會延至下星期二日續行開會、在同事期內、小組委員會所組織之專家股員會、則應將意阿雙方提出之各項文件整理完竣、作成詳備之報吿、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>對意制裁問題　英工黨與工會意見不一　勃萊頓大會作最後決定</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英國工黨與工會、對於向意大利行使制裁之一問題、意見不能一致、步調頗為紊亂、大概項俟九月二十四日工黨在勃萊頓城舉行常年大會時、方可作最後之决定、按英國總工會會長西脫利納最近發表演說、主張對意實施制裁、雞因此引起戰爭亦所不恤、此則遠較工黨多數國會議員之意見更為急進、反之工黨國會黨團領袖藍斯堡、則完全採取和平主義之立塲、認為制裁足以引起戰爭、不足為訓、此則在工黨方面主張應使日內瓦决議發生效力者、亦視為過分軟弱、難加接受、日前工會大會開會時、倉卒間引起此種爭辯、未及從長討論、嗣以若千領袖反法西斯之情感、甚為强烈、遂乃多數通過决議案、主張向政府建議以任何適宜方法、執行國聯會盟約之規定、旣云「任何適宜方法」則戰爭自亦在其內、工會大會此項决議案、其性質之近於偏激、從可知矣、然在工黨方面、則對於此一問題大感理論上之困難、蓋工黨悉採極端和平主義之主張、上次大戰峙、卽有「良心反對從戎者」、此層自亦不可不加以顧及、總之就制裁問題之意見、現可分為三派、一派反對强制制裁、一派主張採取極溫和之制裁、務勿引起武力衝突、最後一派則趨極端、雖引起戰爭亦所不恤、總工會會長西脫利給卽屬此最後一派也、至於工黨方面大多數傾向何派、則當俟九月二十四日之工黨大會始可分曉、就目前形勢加以推測、則工黨大多數似反對極端和平主義、主張行使制裁、但所用方法則不至若工會大會决議案之嚴屬云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>廣東　省營蔗糖事業　已成立新造市頭平淡三廠　每日產量約在二百噸以上　幷從事改良蔗種充足原料</h3>
<p>廣州通訊、廣東天氣溫和、土地肥沃、、原是生產蔗糖之區、從前廣東之蔗糖出口、年逹三千萬元以上、嗣以機器生產洋糖出現以後、土糖製法不精、且成本較高、不能與洋糖競爭、以致被洋糖攙奪市場、土糖事業、遂一蹶不振、影饗於農村經濟甚大、近年來洋糖輸入、全國約計、年達六萬萬餘元、單以廣東而論、亦年逹一萬萬元有奇、漏巵之鉅、殊足驚人、廣東省政府自實施三年施政計劃後、對於蔗糖事業頗爲積極、現由省政府所經營者、有新造市頭兩廠、新造·市頭·位於番愚縣、前臨珠江、交通便利、附近農田有數十萬畝、均適宜於種蔗、省府乃設二糖廠於其間、新造糖廠為檀香山洋商所承建、每日可榨糖五十噸、市頭糖廠為捷克斯可達公司承建、每日可榨糖一百噸以上、兩廠均於二十三年十二月開始榨糖、現時出品、有甲種白糖·乙種白糖·一號粗砂·二號粗砂·四號幼砂·火食糖·糖霜·方糖等、成績頗佳、較勝於爪哇糖以上、至於人材問題、則該兩廠之技術人員、在經營之初、聘有美國·檀香山·及捷克等外國工程師、在廠負責、並有由外國畢業回來之機械化學工科留學生·及國內各大學之化學工稈畢業學生、在廠實習、另有高中畢業百餘人在廠見習、一俟工程熟練後、卽可不必再聘外人、工人方面、大多數為香港太古糖廠工人、回省服務、故該兩廠之技術人員、甚為熟練、惟原料則尙有積極改良之必要、現時原料問題、（一）尙感覺原料供給之不足、（二）蔗種尙需改良、蓋廣東雖為甘蔗生產之區、但年來因土糖事業衰落、蔗田多已荒廢、且機器榨糖、生產量旣增甘蔗之需要亦大、以普通榨糖之木蔗而論、每担蔗僅能榨糖十斤、而新造市頭兩廠、每日能產糖一百五十噸、每噸十六担、計二千五百二十担、則每日需要甘蔗當在二萬五千二百担、查普通農田、每畝生產木蔗七十担至九十担、則非有十數萬畝農田稱蔗、不能使原料源源供給、而新造市頭兩糖廠附近三角洲之農田、平日經已種稻、一旦令其改種甘蔗、則農民多存觀望、况在農村經濟崩潰之時、選購蔗種及肥田料、多缺資本、如墾關荒地種蔗、則更不易做到、當局早已觀察及此、在糖廠籌備之初、卽着手以低利息貸資農民種蔗、每畝貸予農民二十五元、並不需要若何抵押品、祇採十人聯保辦法、手續極其簡便、除貸資農民種蔗之外、並優予蔗價、每担木蔗給價九毫、以農田種木蔗而論、每畝在第一期速買蔗種、成本在六十元左右、第二期不必再買蔗種、成本約四十餘元、而種蔗收獲、則每畝得蔗七十担至九十担、以九毫算、可得六十餘元至八十元之間、一般農民、以有利可圖、紛紛貸資改種、年來農村以賤穀傷農之故、今將種蔗機會、稍為振奮、此未嘗非復興農村經濟之辦法、但現時除三角洲附近蔗田約有數萬畝外、他處農田、因水路較遠或交通未便、輸運需費較多、尙未改種甘蔗、但當局刻正計劃推廣、以求原料之充份供給、以單純推廣蔗田、尙非根本辦法、因三角洲一帶、多爲稻田、倘紛紛改種甘蔗、勢必影響糧食、因此當局乃積極向改良蔗種方面、以圖發展、在糧廠未成立之前、曾聘有外人金格教授、主持蔗種之蕃殖與改良金格教授爲斐列濱大學蔗糖部主任、經騐豐富當其來粵時、肴携有蔗種五十二種、經一年之試騐、結果有七八種適宜於粵省氣候土壞、尤以　”“Pot　2553”“Padaea”三種爲佳、不僅蔗量之生產增加、每畝可獲蔗百餘擔至二百擔、比木蔗增加一倍、且蔗質所含糖分較高、每擔蔗能榨糖十四斤、亦比木蔗增加三分之一、如此、則不僅農民增加收穫、廠方亦不虞原料中斷、且糖分較高、則成本亦可減輕、現時以木蔗榨糖、每擔糖成本約十二元、倘以此項改良種榨糖、則成本約八九元而已、於於農民廠方、兩均裨益、故積極推廣蕃殖、現有改良蔗種十二萬株、已交農民試種、在不久之將來、可以完全改種、則原料問題、當可解决、且成本减輕、亦易與舶來品競爭也、</p>
<p>惠州方面、則有平淡製糖廠、乃第一集團軍軍懇處所籌辦、據聞軍墾處籌辦之目的有四（一）增加政府之歲收（二）鞏固糖業基礎（三）容納殘廢軍人、（四）補救人民懇荒不足、該廠規模與市頭糖廠無異、每日生產量一百噸、技術人員、亦甚熟練、所差異者、乃蔗田由軍墾處指定荒地開墾、並由軍部被裁汰之老弱及殘廢軍人、墾殖種蔗植蔗塲內、敷設輕便鐵路、規模頗大、但仍戚原料不足、遂勸導附近農民種蔗、由糖廠給價收買、其價格照市頭辦法、每祖九毛、刻下出品頗多、成績亦佳、</p>
<p>目下廣東糖廠、除上述三廠已有出品者外、街籌備在潮汕區設立揭陽糖廠、由建廳派彭國瑞負責籌備、其機器為每日生產量七十噸、籌備行將就緒、不日將有出品、次為順德霞村之糖廠、亦正在籌備中、其糖廠仍由捷克斯可逹承建、其機器每日可生產糖一百噸、現已鳩工建築、又軍懇處在瓊崖擔縣、亦擬墾荒種蔗、幷在該地計劃辦一糖廠、省政府方面、對於蘆糖事業、仍積極進行擴充、現計劃在全省各屬設立糖廠十五個、蔗田四百萬畝、故粵省前途、正方興未艾也、</p>

<h3>大中華慘案　工部局報告彙錄　廢料自得燃燒爲起火最大成分</h3>
<p>小沙渡路大中華賽璐珞玩具廠、本年六月二十八日下午八時餘、因不戒於火、致肇焚如、幷延燒附近永慶里之房屋、焚斃二十餘命、灼傷五十餘人、此事迭經特區法院研訊、工部局亦曾提供一切有關證據之事實、以供法院之參考現該案已由法院判决、廠方負責人名各處罰金三百元、其餘一人、無罪開釋、茲特將工部局各關係部份、關於此案所是報於董事會之事實彙錄如下、</p>
<p>廠址房屋</p>
<p>部局工務處會於一九二九年十二月十八日頒發執照准許該廠建築隔離不連屬之廠至三所、復於翌年三月二十七日頒給執照准其建築附屋五所、各自隔離、不相連屬每屋四週、留有廣大曠地、其中所在建築圖樣上、標明「燥室」、並未建築、故該屋之建築執照、不久即喪失效力、嗣後該廠即在燥室原址、私自建業無照會之房屋一所、該屋　為上述時日發生火警之所也、該屋近附近復有房屋一所、曾於去歲八月中、發生火警次、</p>
<p>棧室內容</p>
<p>上述發生火警之屋、係單層方形建築、鋼骨水泥築成、並砌磚墻、原約十吋、在靠隣衖處高約十二呎餘、直逹屋　、東北西北二九、墻高九呎餘、其上各有窗位　扇、長闊約各三呎餘、惟其中每面祇留　扇、其餘悉用磚砌沒、屋內並無電氣設備、屋內並砌有砌墻為一室、其較小者復隔為小窒、留為貯藏之用、上述房屋除四窗及一門之外、別無其他流通空氣之設備、並據管棧人言、即該因窗亦永不開啟、並為防止日光之射入起見、各窗均用木板對釘、該屋頂平、水泥築成、故亦不透空氣、該屋內部有於近屋項處、裝有墊汽管一根、其用途係由該廠之鍋爐、輸送熱汽、至住廠工人所用之浴室、誌項汽管外裹不灰木繩及包皮、尙屬完固、惟有分管一支、其連屬之處、是否有支撑之物、則不得肉知、倘無支撑之物、則分管之重量、即可召致總管報汽之洩露也、</p>
<p>眝藏大概</p>
<p>該發生火警之屋、平時大</p>
<p>抵作為貯藏室之用、而貯藏大部份、係賽璐珞之廢料、據事後調查之所得、該屋在發生火警之日、計貯有（一）賣璐珞廢料四萬三千三百九十一磅、（二）一部份巳製成之玩具若干、（三）全部已製成之玩具若干、（四）德製賽璐珞片二十餘箱、（五）樟腦若干、（六）機器零件等、</p>
<p>廢料多寡</p>
<p>在去年八月、該廠存有廢料二萬七千九百磅、惟自第一次火警發生之後、該廠當局即有發售廢料之意、計自去年八月始、至本年六月、該廠售給南市中興賽璐珞廠之廢料、不下四萬四千餘磅、惟在本年第二次火驚發生之時、廠內所存廢料、仍有四萬三千餘磅之鉅、且在本年月、大中華南市分廠、復與小沙渡路本廠合併、工作增加、廢料堆積亦愈速、故在四五六等月之中、該屋內存入廢料、恒逹五萬磅左右、由此可知大中華廠　有陸續發售廢料之舉、而廠內之堆積、嘗不為之稍减、此等廢料均盛於蔴袋之中、而堆積之高、在火警發生之時、一部份竟逹屋頂、</p>
<p>化學成份</p>
<p>商用賽璐珞內具氮化賽璐珞絲（織維素）百分之五十至七十、氮氣百分之十至十一、樟腦百分之二十五至三十五、及其他軟化品顏色等成分不一、樟腦融化於攝氏一七七度、而在平時亦極易蒸發、賽璐路極易着火、燃燒時發生濃烟、熱度可升至攝氏一千五百度及一千七百度且延燒極速、據化學專家言、氮化賽璐珞絲、有自行腐蝕分化、成為　璐珞絲及硝酸一物之可能、惟能否自行燃燒人爆發、則不一其說、但　貯藏之處、空氣阻塞、該物氧有時所發生之熱度、不易發散、再加以外來之熱、其有增加燃燒點之可能、則至明顯也、故國際勞工局對於賽璐珞　料支置方法、有貯房屋、空氣流通、電燈裝置、均有規定、目每處堆　數量、以八千至一萬磅為限、而存貯之器應用鐵筒云、</p>
<p>廠方措置</p>
<p>根據上述之學理而論、廠方之措置則可發覺許多不合之處、如廢料堆積之　量、竟超過普通規定者四五倍、空氣流通之設備、可云毫無、廢料存貯之器、不以鐵筒、而以蔴袋等是也、惟工部局方面、爲保持工人安全起見、已令廠方裝置室外保險梯、重建室內原有樓梯、樓上噴漆室加以隔離、以上廠方均已一一照辦、廠方並巳允將廢料還原室內容改良、惟不幸火警竟發生於改良進行之前、</p>
<p>火警原因</p>
<p>火驚原因、傳說不一、綜計大略可分二端、（一）謂發生於貯藏室之外者、計有（甲）廠內鍋爐烟囱火星波及、及（乙）廠外鄰屋起火　火星散佈所致、（二）謂係發生於貯藏室之內者、計有（甲）因在貯藏室工作或工人吸烟所致、（乙）因熱汽管熱汽洩露之所致、（內）廢料之自行燃燒、以上該說鍋爐火星散佈、甚屬不可能、因東南近鍋爐虛窗戶常關、並川木板釘沒也、鄰街先行肇火之說、尤不可靠、因該廠西南部均砌有高牆、並門窗均閉、火星實無飛入之可能、可見此說、係山關係方面所揑造、藉以卸資者、若再以火警原因發生於貯藏室之內而言、則謂由於工人工作或吸烟云云、亦不可信、因該屋下午四時半即閉關、並無工人在內、否則火警發生、留於其中勢必喪生也如是則汽管熱汽排拽及廢料自燃、遂成為最後之二原因、惟據事後調查、該處熱水管事前似已關閉、故以情形而論、廢料自行燃燒、遂佔火原最大之成分、雖賽璐珞廢料究否能自行燃燒、尙屬疑問、但倘與油質相接觸、即有起火之可能、此則為衆所共認者、復查該室中堆積之廢料、均係由地上掃起、再貯於蔴袋之內、則頗有沾着油質之可能、再則火警發生之後、當山該廠工作室中提出廢料一袋、檢視有無油漬痕跡、不意竟發現油漬棉紗一綴、及油污之棉布一塊、是可見油質並非絕無、且蔴袋堆積如山、悶置斗室之中、天氣酷熱、溫度增高、在在有致廢料自焚之可能、且亦意中事也、故起火原因、可云係因油漬之廢料、堆積過多、月無流通空氣之設備所致、</p>
<p>火警情形</p>
<p>大約賽璐珞燃燒之後、因該物爆發性强之故、立即將東北部小室之門轟去、西南部墻　繼之崩塌、火箭四射、遂致殃及隔鄰永慶里、該里共有房屋八十六所、中間除一狹街外、僅隔一竹籠、故火箭侵襲之時、瞬忽即成燎原之勢、計房屋之完全焚燬者七所、大部份焚燬者四所、一部份焚燬者四所、灼死男女共二十七命、傷者四五十人、而該處居民之密集、亦為事實之一、計該里房屋、均係一上一下、平均每幢居十人、至少四人、多者十六人、據云死者有睡於擱樓上、致火驚發生後、一時無法逃生者</p>
<h3>瞿亞宏女醫　接生救護母兒兩命　橫生產危迫眉睫　施手術敏捷脫險</h3>

<p>生係難產中之難產、通常須行開腹、或將兒體截斷、方得取出、殺一命、救一命、巳屬產家幸事、今亞宏醫師竟獲救全兩命、誠不愧為將門之子也、</p>

<h3>福履理路　拐匪機關規模宏大　房屋兩幢一廂前後四通八達　茄勒路旅館中又拘獲一女匪</h3>
<p>海關水巡捕房探員、於前日上午十一時許、會同救濟婦孺總會調查員陳小遷、在日淸公司香港班嵩山丸輪船上、破獲拐婦兩人、起出被拐男孩二名、其情會載昨報、惟該捕房以拐匪機關之組織决不如是簡單、蓋　祇此兩老嫗而　將三孩拐帶出口販賣兩嫗目互相指駡、頗屬不近情理、故不厭求詳、於昨日上午、復將二孩由救濟會帶同研究、其較大之魏長生施金海兩孩、見各探和藹可親、漸敢</p>
<p>吐露眞相</p>
<p>據謂昨日所稱隔夜由蘇州乘夜車來滬之說、係拐婦所教、實則渠等數孩來滬、已十餘日、住於某處樓房內、且小孩不祇三人、拐犯中尙有男子數人、渠等日常由拐婦硬嚇軟騙、强迫呼拐婦張湯氏為母親如不從命、即用木板責打手心、呼之則有糖果玩具等為酬、在滬數日、畫夜不許外出、因小孩共有五六人、相處稍久、亦</p>
<p>並不見苦</p>
<p>、惟尙有兩三男孩、於數日前被男拐領出、我等祇知係被領至大世界看戲、惟迄未回來等話、又六歲幼孩阿炳、亦漸敢發言、據稱伊名方炳生、家件蘇州閶門附近父親在街上擺設香烟攤、伊巳在幼稚園諸書云云、惟詢之乃父名字、則不能對、女探員得此綫索、復將拐婦張湯氏提出嚴詰、初尙狡賴、經一再盤詢、始稱誘拐總　關係在法租界</p>
<p>福履理路</p>
<p>錫賢坊五號、該捕房當派幹探程永年·李文錡·沈長珊·梁慎卿·等、帶同湯氏及小孩魏長生·施金海·兩名、同至盧家濤捕房、會同探捕按址前往抄查、見錫賢坊五號係兩幢一廂房、前後門均已緊鎖、如由後門走出、財係別弄、此處可四通八逹、為拐匪惟·逃避之最佳處所、各探乃由前弄破扉而入、見內部</p>
<p>規模頗大</p>
<p>置有行軍牀·板榻·六七隻、該拐婦自稱係事供拐來之小孩睡覺、若輩並有切口、稱拐來爲拾來、如出錢將小孩買來、稱爲做來、　稱被拐之小孩爲石數、言詞頗為發噱、其時同去之兩孩、指出廂房樓後面之一榻、為伊兩人同睡、至是復在牀底下檢出玩具多種、均係拐匪所給、施金海且指</p>
<p>一洋鐵罐</p>
<p>為其山家中被拐時帶出、探等復巡視一週、見匪等遣下飯　頗多、如白葉結一碗蠶豆板椒菜等、均已乾硬、　米粥半鍋、亦巳發　、觀此情狀、藉知匪黨見嵩山丸上秘密敗露時、即行逃避他去、探等再詢張湯氏別處有無附屬機關、湯氏又供出法租界唐家　附近茄勒　三百三十五？共和旅館內、匪黨常去租開房間、各探乃再往該</p>
<p>旅館搜查</p>
<p>果在亭子房間內、拘獲專行代藏被拐小孩之紹興婦人王周氏（五十一歲）一名·當仍一併提回柿房、據王周氏供稱、伊只管看守小孩、不做別事、以惟該捕房以施孩家中鄰居五號門牌、尙有業木匠之浦東人馬錫根、其七歲子名阿大、係與施孩同時被拐、隔昨乃妻嚴氏曾投捕房查認、見三孩中並無伊子、故痛哭而去、現此孩尙無下落、仍有</p>
<p>深究必要</p>
<p>復將湯氏盤詰、始又供出實情、據稱該拐小孩機關、已有許久歷史、因行動詭秘、終未敗露、所做交易、（即拐販小孩）已有多起、最近除起出之三孩外、尙有七歲·十二歲·及十五歲·一孩、已於數日前由兩男一婦、乘輪帶往汕頭販賣矣等語、探等以十二歲、十五歲·兩孩、雖不明</p>
<p>何家子弟</p>
<p>但七歲一孩、頗似馬錫根之失蹤子無疑、惟旣已出口、除電請汕頭當局追查外、實無他法、當由捕頭復訊一過、飭將先後所獲三婦、仍留押捕房、二孩亦送救濟會暫宿一宵、　今日併送地方法　訊究、並着原辦各探、嚴組在逃匪黨、　案究辦、</p>

<p>全國地政會議特刊</p>
<h3>內政部召集全國地政會議籌備經過</h3>
<p>自土地法施行法明令公布，同時並奉院令，關於十地法各編之施行日期及區域，應如何分別規定，以及前送估計專員任用條例草案，現經立法院决議，毋庸經立法程序，應否照原草案以命令公布，飭部妥議呈核。</p>
<p>本部意見，土地法每篇含義甚廣，條文甚繁，按照目前各地方實際情形，不如就土地法各部份明定施行標準，暫不以分編為限，以資各地方政府之依據。遂參照中央法令及各地方事實，另定各省市地政施行程序大綱，為地政實施之標準。又以各省市以前舉辦之土地行政，辦法各殊，與土地法原則多未吻合，尤應依法厘整，以期中央地方，法令事實聯絡貫通。擬召集各省市主辦地政人員曁各關係部會代表，舉行全國地政會議，以期集思廣益，羣策淮行。</p>
<p>乃於本年四月呈奉行政院指令，應准由部召集全國地政會議，將關於土地法各編之施行日期及區域，曁應否另定各省市地政施行稈序大綱各問題與估計專員任用條例等草案，一併交由該會議詳愼審議。</p>
<p>本部依據此案，擬訂地政會議各項規則，呈准以部令公布，定於六月中旬在本部舉行第一次全國地政會議，並擬具草案四種，分咨各關係部會曁各省市政府，詳加研究，簽具意見，連同所擬提案及派定代表姓名，限五月三十日以前咨部，以便彙　整理。</p>
<p>經此次咨行以後，大多省份均能及期咨復，中有少數省份，不免愆期，以致未能如期召集。遂於本年六月二次通咨，確定九月十日為本會議開幕之期。其未將提案意見曁代表姓名咨報者，務在七月三十一日以而咨送到部，已咨送者，如有補充之　，亦限七月一律送齊彙辦。又鑒於九月十日係星期二，為行政院行政會濟例會，於政務恐有未便，復將本會議改定為九月十二日午前八時在本部舉行開幕典禮，當經呈院備案，並通電各關係機關轉知各出席代表，準時出席。</p>
<p>在會議期前，於各省市最近地政實施狀况，務在明瞭情形，乃派技正王瀛蛟專赴豫皖贛鄂湘五省，派科長駱力學等赴南京市政府，實地視察，搜集材料，均具有詳細報吿，可供參考。</p>
<p>八月初旬本會　秘書處照章組織，派駱力學為秘書主任，並派定其他職員，開始籌備。綜計在本會內，各關係部會，曁各省市政府，以及　術機關，派定會員六十八人，收到提案五十一件，簽具意見十七　，均經分別整理。此本會義籌備經過之大槪情形如此。</p>
<h3>地政會議開會詞</h3>

<p>第一十　法施行業行　明令公布，土地法及施行法各編如何施行，依法應由中央地政機關分別厘定其施行區域及日期，呈由國民政府以命令定之。本部意見，與其就十地法各部分，一一以命令規定其施行之地域與日期，不但手續太繁，且就事實關察，各編中亦間有全編實行，尙不無窒碍者，似不如就土地法各部分，以條文擬定其施行之標準，呈准公布，以資各省市政府之依據。惟茲事體大，亟應召集各省市政府及關係部會共同商討。以期施行便利。</p>
<p>其次在士地法尙未施行以前，各省市為地方需要，不乏提前辦理土地行政之地方。各地辦法多不相同。雖經本部於民國二十三年擬具各有市舉辦地政程序大綱，呈院核定公布；以資各地方之依據，然在該大綱公布以前各省市業經舉辦之事業，大都與法定原則，未能吻合。土地法及施行法旣卽將次施行，各地方已辦之士地行政，自應依法厘整。如何根據法令，顧全事實，期得辦理妥善，尤有召集各地方負責辦理土地行政人員，詳加研討之必要。</p>
<p>再查各地方辦理土地行政之共同困難，厥為經費之不敷或全部無着。如何於不增加人民負但之原則下，確定各地方地政經費之來源，亦需廣徵各省市政府之意見，訂定共同之辦法。</p>
<p>以上為本部召集此次地政會議之重要原因。至於各地方政府辦理土地行政有年，大都積有豐富之經餘，尤願借此機會，典同討論。中央已定之法令，是否間有在事實上杆格難行之處，亦可盡最提出，作成公共意見，本部自可代為轉陳，以便酌加修正，期於盡善。</p>
<p>今日本會開幕之初，尤望中央各機關多所指導。會議期間，各出席人，對於各方提案多加研究。庶使本會之决議案，不落空泛，全國地政前途，得有共同之南針，利賴無窮，本部實深祝之。</p>
<h3>地政會議之使命</h3>
<p>— 許修直</p>
<p>整理土地，為實現民生主義之重要政策。我國農產貧乏，益以豪强兼併，土地糾紛頻仍，農村不安，多由土地利用之不臧，經界紊亂，分配不當，負担失平所致。欲加改善，土地整理自為首要之圖。是以總理以整理土地為地方自治開始實行之基本工作，而尤以地盡其利，並使人民有平均享用土地權利，為創立三民主義國家之建國綱領。</p>
<p>國民政府遵奉經理遺教，於十九年制定士地法，期能逐漸平均地權，以逹耕者有其田之目的。祇以施行法未能　即製定公布，不克早日推行各省市迫於整理地籍之必要，間有先行擬訂單行法現，提前舉辦者。惟各地辦法旣多不同，步驟亦難一致。內政部適奉令暫管中央土地行政，愛依照土地法原則，擬訂各省市舉辦地政程序大綱，呈院核定頒行，以為各省市在土地法未施行前舉辦地政之依據。同時遵令擬具土地法施行法草案，呈院核轉立法院審議。</p>
<p>茲土地法施行法業經公布，內政部復有召集全國主管地政人員，在京舉行第一次全國地政會議之舉。良以各省市地政事宜，先後舉辦者，已逹二十餘處。進行　速者，且逹土地登記及估價徵枕之程序。惟因各地情形不同，人力財力各異，辦理情形，殊欠整齊。就淸厘地籍而言，有正式辦理測量者，有舉行田畝查丈者，有辦理土地陳報者；就確定產權而言，有正式登記者，有發照註册者。凡斯種種，士地法施行之後，如何依法厘整，實有召集全國從　土地行政之人員，共加研討之必要。加以土地行政，事屬創舉，工作繁難，需費亦鉅。值此國步艱難之時，各省市地政經費如何統籌，技術人員如何訓練，如何以最經濟之辦法，收最妥善之效果，在在有需於本屆地政會議詳加討論，期能次第實行，則國家與人民咸所利賴。全國地政事業，方在萌芽筆路業縷，本屆全國地政會議，實啟其端。所負使命，極為重要，願與諸君共勉之焉！</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （朱人一）</p>
<p>可憐閨裏月，偏照漢家營。」在這戰雲密佈的世界上，所謂二十世紀的文明時代，正不知道打動了多少可憐老的心　呢？</p>
<p>詩歌最容易使人引起同樣的情感，而月光最容易使人發生情感作用。在秋夜的月光下，有多少人悲愁哭泣？更有多少人輕歌軟語啊！</p>
<p>「金劍已沉埋，壯氣蒿萊。晚凉天凈月華開，想得玉樓遙殿影，空照秦淮！」李後主的詞句，借着月光的傳遞，深地印在我們的腦膜上了。</p>
<p>「月有陰晴圓缺，人有悲歡離合。」夫而，我們在快樂的時候，大多不會想到殘缺的月亮。當我們逢到了別離的時候，見着團圓的月亮，才會發生無限的愁緒。</p>
<h3>中秋談月</h3>
<p>— 秋郎</p>
<p>春花的嬌豓，和秋月的妍麗，同是供人欣賞的至寳，尤其是中秋的一輪皓月，分外鮮明，晶瑩圓潤，彷彿玉鏡冰盤，使各種意境不同的人望着，發生了悲，愁，歡，樂，的許多感想，，雖然中秋的典實是很多的，但總離不開蟾宮月窟的話兒，足見月之於人類，實有深切的印象哩。</p>
<p>歷來詩人對於詠月的佳句，不勝枚舉，其中最是傳育人口的，要數李太白的：「小時不識月，呼作白玉盤，」和「與其他專咏中秋月的如：「月至中秋分外明」「一年明月今宵多」又是贊譽倍至，這些都是千古名句，為月兒增光不少。</p>
<p>稗官家言如搜神記載：「后羿請不死之藥於西王母，嫦娥竊之以奔月，」又天寳遺事載：「唐明皇與申天師，中秋夜遊月宮」等，雖都屬無稽之談，然而含有不少趣味，令人發生幻想。</p>
<p>月中的神秘亦很多，如：「月為七寳裝成，常有二萬八千戶修之」，又「吳剛伐月中桂，斧起樹合」，又「月中有玉兔畢歲搗玄霜，」凡此種種神話，僅博得小兒女的笑樂，在這二十世紀科學昌明時代，科學家的很中之月，不過是行星之一，比轉動為地球繞日，月又澆地球，一九二〇年美國克拉克大學科學教授哥達氏，他依據科學的研究，欲製造一種火箭，射入月球，至一九二二年德國科學家屋布氏，復擬依據哥氏計劃，更製一用輕氣與酒精之飛機，飛入月中，但是結果都為了所費太鉅，未竟全功！所以月中的秘密，至今還沒有詳確報告。</p>
<p>總之，中秋這個團圓滿月，是大公無私普照大地的，上海的人看了，自然不盡欣賞，可是災區的人望着，也許正在落淚吧！</p>
<h3>他的繁忙</h3>
<h3>去年中秋夜</h3>
<p>— 憶秋</p>
<p>丹桂飄香的中秋佳節，又姍姍地駕臨了，使我悽然地回憶起一件往事。</p>
<p>是去年的中秋夜，我在琴妹家吃晚飯，伊親自燒了兩樣我最愛吃的乾菜鴨和麵拖蟹，還替我買了一瓶桑子葡萄酒，　鳴九卜，德弟鐘兄也都趕到，於是一齊上桌大嚼起來，席間，大家商議晚飯以後的玩意。琴殊提義去看大光明的一張名片，德弟主張到辣斐花園去跳舞，鐘兄說還是叉八圈吧，我一律反對，要到龍華去走月亮。正在紛紛爭　的時候，琴妹忽然哈哈哈地大笑不止，大家審視一番，原來八仙桌上坐了九位仁兄，怪不得活潑善笑的琴妹要閉不攏嘴了。</p>
<p>飯後，最知己的琴妹德弟附和了我，才實現了我的主張——走月亮——大家頭戴着皎潔的月亮，緩緩地向着龍華進發。</p>
<p>不多一會，可愛的月姊將我們領到一個幽靜的去處，龍華路旁的幾棵丹桂樹下，於是，大家都席地而坐，德弟取出口琴，琴妹放開嗓子：「凉風似小舟，駕到了中秋……」一曲『花好月圓，一令人悠然神往。我舒適地躺在草地上，仰望着晶瑩的明月，側聽那柔去的歌聲，使我志却了這是人間，志却了這是一個憂患苦痛的人間！啊！琴妹和德弟的賜予！雖說，僅僅是那末一剎那的幸福，愉快，　成了我生命史上最珍貴的一頁了。</p>
<p>今年，唉，不幸的今年，琴妹是遠走南洋，到那離我一萬餘里的爪哇去了，可憐的德弟，在今年的四月間病死在杭州，已長眠地下了！唉唉！一個生離，一個死別，今年的中秋夜，我將用什麼方法來挨過呢？</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十八回　感黨高攀逢迎斥小吏雌威大作嘈雜惱夫人</p>
<p>他越說越生氣，聲音也大了起來，在這樣夜深，自然是樓上也會聽到，這又聽到樓上好幾個人大聲叫着樓下茶房。馬三聽到，走出房來趕快的轉吿那些同事，千萬不可以上樓。在樓上叫了幾陣，不見有茶房上樓去，就有兩個專員的聽差，一路喊着下了梯子來，只嚷茶房不出來，找賑房去。賈多才嚷着在先，聽差們嚷着在後，早是把旅館裏的人，都已驚動了出來，羣園在過廳裏。到這夜深，聲音是更顯　嘈雜了。藍太太吩付茶房下去，不但沒有把環境肅淸，而目是更嘈雜起米，就扳了臉向藍專員道：這種情形，也太給你面子上下不來了吧？你能忍受，我不能忍受。說着，將脚在樓板上一頓。藍專員　？等賬房來了，我來質問他，你不用忙。藍太太道：我們在南京，也沒有受過人家這種侮辱，到了西安，我還要受人家的欺侮嗎？不成不成！說着，將手連連在桌上拍了兩下。恰好賬房先生被兩個聽差押着走進房來，遠遠的站定，行了一個鞠躬禮。藍太太搶先便問道：你是小西天的賬房嗎？賬房答應了是。藍太太道：你們太不够開旅館的資格了。這樣的公衆塲所，能容得人深夜在這裏哭嗎？那的旅客是個幹什麼的？好像他不服，還在樓下駡茶房，他自己違犯公共秩序，他不知道嗎？你去對他說，他若不服，有什麼理由，對我們來說。說喻了，他細誧蓋行李走路。賬房陪笑道：我們作買賣的，可不敢同客人去說這種强話。藍太太喝道：　混帳！我們這是說强話嗎？賬房淡笑道：夫人！我以前也混過小差事，什麼大人物也見過，我怎麼混帳？藍太太述連拍着桌子道：混帳混帳，偏要　　你混帳。兩個聽差，見夫人嘴唇發抖，知道這氣就大了，而張房大喝一聲，舉拳就打。賬房看看敵不過，扭身就跑。（三一三）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>這樣一說，伊倒笑起來了。</p>
<p>「你旣然愛它，你就拿了去吧！」伊老人家爽快又給了我一個特殊的恩典，於是我的　　中便又多了一件值得誇耀的御賜品了。不過伊這一次的賞這玉棍給我，却决非因為我做了什麼好的事情，而以此為獎，更不是忽然高興而有此賞賚，實在是為了這玉棍已給我偷用過了一次，伊老人家心中有所厭惡，不顧再使用的緣故。然而不管它，我終於又到手了一件寳玩！我自問在宮中的時候，每逢見到有什麼可愛的東西，心上雖極羨慕，但總竭力耐着，不輕易流露出來；否則在我二年半的服務期間內，像太后那樣專好把東西賞人的脾氣，再加伊又特別的重視我，我必能弄到許多的東西了，而且其中儘多值價極鉅的寳物，正可使我終生享用不盡咧！</p>
<p>還有一件東西也是太后信以為極能增美人的容色的．我想太后的所以要那樣的注重伊的容色，也許多半是受了我們這些女官的影響；　因為太后生平有一種很壞的脾氣，就是專愛以貌取人．伊對於伊的廷臣尙且如此，那末伊　於我們自然更注意了！所以我們八個人中，委實是沒有一個可以給人稱為「醜陋」的．（四一三）</p>
<p>拉雜話</p>
<h3>中秋瑣話</h3>
<p>— 尤愛梅</p>
<p>月明萬里，又是中秋；回憶兒時，門庭頗盛。每當此夜，舉室歡　。設筵祀嫦娥後，嬌憨不寢，必待月華；先君或有嗔責，畏極則啼。先王母素溺愛，攬予入懷，食以月餅，輙復坐伴許時，直至夜深露冷，疲極自眠。此情此景，如在目前。及今家境蕭索，　興闌珊，惟餘　勞母子。相依為命；雖逢佳節，亦復何　？緬想當年，不勝感慨無已！</p>
<p>又憶：「五年前，先　識一婦，一女，遇合之緣，俱與中秋有關；而曾幾　時，一則千里長征，空寄還珠之淚；一則九原不作，難招倩女之魂。人孰無情，誰能遺此？憧憬所至，彌覺愴懷。借問：廣寒仙子—玉立雲邊，明眸所睞，亦嘗及此傷心人，而憐念之否？</p>
<p>前記兩則，語語牢愁，重累讀者不歡。固予心緒使然，亦殊不能無歉。茲移找筆尖，為稽舊籍，得艷關神話，雜記之，以贖否愆。宣室志：「周生者，有道術，中秋夜，謂坐客曰：我能梯雲取月，置之懷袖。因取傷數白條，繩而駕之，曰：找梯取此月。俄以手舉衣，懷中出月寸許，光色色燦爛，寒氣入肌骨。」皇甫牧三水小牘：「趙　徵，有道術，中秋積陰不解，知微曰：可　酒殺，登天柱峰翫月。旣出門，天色開雲；及登峰，月色如畫；比下山，凄風苦雨，陰晦如故。」傳奇錄：「書生文蕭，中秋夜，遊鍾陵西山，覩一妹，其麗；歌曰：若能相伴陟仙山，應得文簫駕彩鸞。生意其仙女。植足不去，姝亦相盼。歌罷，秉燭相引，至絕頂。俄有仙童待天判曰：吳彩鸞，以私慾洩天機，誦為民妻一紀。妹乃與生下山，歸鐘陵。」入蜀記：「神女峯，每八月十五夜，月明時，有絲竹之音，往來峯頂。」他如唐明王與鴻都道士。入月宮，聽霓裳羽衣曲事，則盡人而知之者，故不贅。</p>
<p>關於中秋所獨有之天然奇景，如：「太如縣，耳河東岸，有分水厓，自岸下分水為雨，—南河，北海。—八月望夜，河，海，正中，有珊瑚樹，出水面，漁人往往昆之，世傳：海龍獲寳。內典云：珊瑚撑月即此。」見名勝志。又如：「杭之鳳凰山，有石如片雲，拔地高數丈，巔有一竅，尺餘，名日月巖，惟中秋之月，穿竅而出，餘時則斜出竅外矣。」見七修類　。予未嘗遊杭、此所謂「日月巖」，未知即今傳之「三潭印月」否也？</p>
<p>昔東坡作中秋月詩，有：「嘗聞此宵月，萬里陰晴同。」句注云：「故人史生為予言，嘗見海賈云：中秋有月，則是歲珠多而圓，賈人常以此候之。雖相去萬里，他日會合相問，則陰晴無不同有。」予按：天之氣候，因地而異，　如所言，亦奇徵已！</p>
<p>陳蜨　兄，不喜啖月餅，作　眉散記，甚詆其無味。而予則酷嗜厥物，以為絕美。孟子謂：「口之於味，有同嗜焉」。此正未可信也。</p>
<p>前人咏中秋詩，流轉佳句甚多。如曹松云：「無雲世界秋三五，共看蟾盤上海涯」。韓愈云：「一年明月今宵多」．王建　：「夜深盡放家入睡。直到天明不炷燈。趙嘏云：「一色千里中秋月。」股文圭云：「萬里無雲鏡九州，最團圓夜如中秋，」徐放云：「玉露中秋夜，金波碧落開。」李洞云：「四十五秋宵，月分千里豪。」羅隱云：「一半秋光此夕分」。趙　云：「秋氣平分月正明。」偶就憶記　得，錄以殿吾文焉。</p>

<p>推鉛球　二區沈天驥、力大如牛、成績逹十公尺四一、連日練習甚勤、仍有進步、冠軍穩矣、五區黃震為舊紀錄之保持者、成績較沈稍差、但人定勝大、未嘗不可出奇制勝、三區王榮季、八區曹金　、一區魏榮燾、”續在水平綫上、紀錄板上均有得分希望、</p>
<p>擲鐵餅　八區曹金鐵、有三三·五五米、優越成績、舊紀錄二八米八七之魏榮襯、亦有進步、但冠軍無望、二區劉泳川、二區張錫、四區徐樹模、五區周鴻飛、企圖榜上留名、</p>
<p>擲標槍　一區黃良興成績超過四十米、寳椅穩坐、三區朱瀚亞軍不愁、一區王良興、四區潘世榮、五區雷駿謙、六區朱慶餘、共爭三四名、</p>
<p>（二）男徑賽</p>
<p>百米　本屆短跑大王程金冠代表三區出席、為大會出色不少、冠軍一席、捨程莫屬、二區之葉潔、三區之吳禮本、四區之吳子靜、八區之曾榮忠、競爭位置、</p>
<p>二百米　此項比賽、仍為程君傑作、豈容他人染指、二區葉潔、三區吳禮本、四區吳子靜、八區曾榮忠、均有得分希望、</p>
<p>四百米　斯比人材薈萃、跑王程金冠固無論天、八區之曾榮忠李延祥、均為滬上能手、前年會代表滬市出席全運、此次出席省運、將為各該區爭取分數、一塲血戰、為不可免、將為全塲觀衆最注意之一項、</p>
<p>八百米　二區葛敬德、二區朱球、八區李延祥、最高成績、均在二分十二三秒之間、鹿死誰手、殊　預測、以經騐論之、李延鮮、希望較多、老將金仲康及時努力、入選不難、</p>
<p>千五百米　談到長距離、老將金仲康、則不老　、冠軍有望、　八區之王好發、成績不弱、老將須當心、三區固芷礽、四區傳元祥、五區楊細根、得分心切、好自為之、</p>
<p>萬米　老將金仲康長勤利害、全國紀錄雖難保持、省紀鋒本届仍將連任、成續一六分六秒、已打破本人三七分八秒五一之省紀錄、二區吳漢章、出足吃奶氣力、以與老將一爭、不妨試試</p>
<p>高欄　本屆成績平均、二區張紫影有十八秒四之成績、四區　漢民十八秒六、一區陳天和十九秒、競爭必烈、新紀錄或可出現、誰家天下、看當時的努力、</p>
<p>中關　程金冠不彈此調久　、此次名列其中、有無特殊成績尙不可知、惟以程之四百米論之、首席亦不難獲得、三區陶劍萍、為程勁敵、須要當心、</p>
<p>綜觀徑賽全局、三區因跑王參加、佔絕對優勢、</p>
<p>（三）全能</p>
<p>五項　二區蔣懷仁有二千分成績、實力最雄、冠軍當無問題、三區王團楨為亞軍、一區吳泰廣、如能臨塲加油、亞軍未必無望、</p>
<p>十項　一區吳泰廣、成績猛進、縣運會上超過四千分以上、首席已為的定、一區潘絳年、四區吳玉琪競爭亞軍、舊紀錄保持者魏榮壽參加區運臨塲傷腿、中途放棄、黃拔時竟遭落選、一區全能錦標、因之無望、</p>
<p>接力　三區書力雄厚、四百米接力穩居首座、二區次之、千六百米接力以三區佔優、但八區擁有中距離各將兩員、定不甘示落、必出全力競爭</p>
<p>（四）女田徑</p>
<p>五十米　　區常熟小姐、龐媛玉雅人能敵、區運成績　七秒、省運司破全國、一區陳梅仙、三區瞿美英亦可破省紀錄、為爭奪亞軍、</p>
<p>百米　鰲頭仍為龐媛玉獨占、一區吳菊心、陳梅仙、三區續惠珍、一區蔣芝蘭、屆時競爭必烈、祀分板上不知誰有幸運、</p>
<p>二百米　此項無特出人材、可見中國女子缺乏長力、僅一區吳菊心有三十一秒餘之成續、餘如三區陳蕙珍、四區蔣月皎、實力均在三十四五秒之間、惜常孰龐已參加四項、否則省紀錄又可打破、</p>
<p>八十米欄　此項亦不景氣、二區徐碧雲、有十六秒六成續、冠軍如囊中探物、其他各區、均在十七秒以外、</p>
<p>跳高　龐小姐亦屬此中能手、當仁不讓、一區陳海仙雖實力不差、終　讓龐一着、丹陽女子王桂鄉、雄心不小、想搶亞軍、</p>
<p>跳遠　龐小姐拿手傑作、演來定必不凡、區運破全國、省運或可再進步、此爲大會最精彩之一幕、十一日下午三時半、觀眾必爲此節目所迷、到那時再夾報吿、</p>
<p>推鉛球　一、區邵維榮、二區馮玉珍、八區孫德芳、成績在八米之間、破省紀錄非難事、誰屬冠軍、等待　們的各個努力、</p>
<p>擲鐵餅　三區馮玉珍、有二十四米八六之成績、距全國紀錄不選、誰敢與爭、但亞軍為邵維榮與八區孫德芳所必爭、</p>
<p>壘球　一區王桂卿區紀錄為四五·五〇米、與全國差五八分、省運固無敵手、惟冀其能破全國耳、二三兩區成續不過四十米、亞軍未知誰屬、</p>
<p>擲標槍　八區孫德芳成績二十四米、冠軍已無問題、一區士桂卿、三區周其崑爭亞軍、</p>
<p>四百米接力　女田徑錦標、看一三兩區娘子軍之鬥法、二區人才平均、三區兵少將精、錦標誰屬、須着接力結果、故此項比賽、不僅一三兩區之爭、一區亦虎視在旁、</p>

<h3>本市參加全運會　女網球昨初賽　蘇剪花黃志方表演較精彩嚴敬委何祚惠均獲複賽權</h3>
<p>本市參加全國運動會女子網球　選、於昨日下午二時起、在中國網求會舉行初賽、由選拔委員會主席張子靈到塲主持、共賽單打四組、結果蘇剪花、嚴敬委、何祚惠、黃志方等獲得複賽權、定本月十四日下午一時仍在中國網球會舉行複賽、茲將昨賽結果分錄如下、</p>
<p>蘇剪花勝王世琨</p>
<p>前會代表閩省女子網球參加上屆全國運動會之蘇剪花女士、此翻來滬、就讀大夏、昨日二時出馬與王世琨交鋒、畢竟久戰沙塲、資格老練、不慌不忙、遠擊近攻、均有可取、開賽速取兩局、惟王亦不弱、常出其不意制蘇死命、一轉瞬閒奪回兩局、至此雙方表演漸見精彩、三比三後、蘇更見神男、連獲三局、第盤遂以六比三佔先、第一盤中王難精神不弱、但錯球其多、而蘇則愈戰愈為得手、卒又以六比一獲勝、</p>
<p>嚴敬委勝陳愛貞</p>
<p>嚴陳之戰亦於二時同時開始兩人均嫌軟弱、戰來頗少精彩、嚴以身材較高、常在發球中見勝、惟其姿勢則頗不自然、行動較爲呆滯、倘能加意練習、利用其身長力大、亦屬良材、陳雖較爲活潑、然氣力見遜、致不能獲勝、其成績如下、</p>
<p>黃志方勝陸美雲</p>
<p>黃小姐為本市上　出席全運會之女子網球代表、其球藝與蘇剪花不相上下兩人同在大夏讀書、時相切磋、頗見進步、發球銳利異常、底綫拍球亦頗有功夫、陸小姐新自南洋來滬、擊球勁力甚硬、姿勢亦自然可觀、惜以練習較少、出球無把握、致兩盤均為黃小姐以光盤獲勝、</p>
<p>何祚惠勝陳美波</p>
<p>何祚專與陳美波之比賽、亦於三時與黃陸同時開始、兩人球藝相埒、戰來難分勝負、小陳發球銳利、行動活潑、初戰大有取勝之處、惟本被何小姐以智取勝、二被於奔命、氣力漸見不足、兩局均以六比三爲何祚惠獲勝、</p>
<p>複賽秩序已排定</p>
<p>複賽定十四日下午二時起在中國網球會舉行、名將如新自澳大利亞歸國這魏氏姊妹、以及林寶華夫人梁佩瑜女士、曁本市上屆出席全運女子網球代表茅於文等、均出塲應戰、以昨日球勢觀之、嚴敬委何祚惠希望較少、嚴蘇剪花黃志方則將出全力、以應職魏氏姊妹、屆時必有一翻劇戰也、其秩序如</p>
<p>化對魏麥谷（二時）</p>
<p>嚴敬委對梁佩瑜（二時）</p>
<p>黃志方對魏祖同（三時）</p>
<p>何祚惠對茅於文（三時）</p>

<h3>小男兒（四）（三）</h3>
<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄（宗海）譯</p>
<p>乃德聽了，臉上也發出驚異之色，說道，「我本以為你喜歡有窮苦孩子來和你一塊住，並且會好生看待他們，像你對我一般的」。</p>
<p>「這倒是眞的，可是我也願意先知道他們是怎樣的人。我不得不揀擇一下，因為世間窮苦的孩子也太多了。我的地方不夠盡行收留。如其能夠，不是頂好嗎」？</p>
<p>「我呌他來因爲我想你也會喜歡的，但假如沒有地位，他還可以回去」，乃德戚然說道。</p>
<p>這孩子對她善待孤苦的信心使斐膚人聞而感動，她拿不起心來使他失望，打碎了他好心腸的小計劃，因此她說道：</p>
<p>「道個唐恩到底是什麼一個人，你千訴我罷」。</p>
<p>「我也不知道什麼，只曉得他沒親沒眷，又窮，待我很好，所以我也願意盡我的力好好待他。</p>

<p>『他可以睏在我的床裏，我可以到睏穀倉裏去。那邊並不冷，我不在乎的；我以前常和父親隨處宿夜的」，乃德充滿了熱情說來。</p>

<h3>國貨小談天</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>中秋月餅，小道也，然非有大學問大見識大本領，斷不能立於優勝地位。某日參觀冠生園，訪洗冠生君談天。洗君大談其月餅之道津津有味。洗君之言曰：做月餅不難，難在適合顧客口味，販賣月餅不難，難在恰到好處。冠生園每逢中秋令節之前十天，卽須全神貫注於月餅工作。設計者，製造者，調查者，進料者，配貨者，售賣者，聯合呼應，息息相通，某種暢銷，某種滯銷，某種應多做，某種宜少做，多固虛耗，少亦不行；總之供求相應，恰到好處，月餅之學，思過半矣。洗君之言雖為月餅言，其實國貨出品，何莫不然？</p>
<p>橡膠工業，人人認為無可經營矣。顧橡膠工業，豈僅套鞋而已。大量需要，在乎車胎。大中華橡膠廠薛福基吳哲生二君，獨能見到此點，努力打開新路，獨製汽車，包車，自由車之輪胎。觀　出品，駕舶來而上之，為各地公路所樂用。可見事業無好壞，在乎人力之如何耳。</p>
<p>國貨界之新出路，當不忘南洋貿易。日前劉士木先生談及日本人之注意南洋貿易，無孔不入，無微不至，以南洋為日本之生侖線，以全力對付之，返視吾國工商界，目光如豆，只顧眼前，事事落後，着着失敗，可為痛哭。深望有眼光有見識之國貨界，今後當放大視線。展拓區域，使國外貿易，不受制於外人，則國貨界一線生機，不致減絕。語車心長，我國貨界當永永不忘。</p>
<p>光明熱水瓶廠梁伯枝君，於努力推廣出品工作之外，獨注意於店員與推銷員之訓練，廣延事家，切實訓練。梁君之言曰：推銷工作，一半得力於貨品，一半得力於推銷人才。並獎勵推銷員之補習學識，給以獎學金，以資鼓勵；此種用意，尤可敬偑。吾知梁君本此旨趣，努力淮行，以後所得之成續，固小可限量也。</p>
<h3>國貨與「中秋節」</h3>
<p>— 肖白</p>
<p>節序像飛一般地過去，今天又是舊歷的中秋佳節，中國人是總不能忘舊的，我們只要看這幾天來各大商店·公司中購節品者的擁擠，每個家庭中相互送禮的忙碌，足見得大家是在充分地準備過節，這是毫無疑義的。</p>
<p>不過，在這兒，我又要像神經過敏地想到，並且·這也是事實，恐怕在國人普遍的崇拜洋貨心埋下，每一個節的到臨，却正是又給洋貨以傾銷的好機會。所以，在這時候，我深深地恐懼，只怕這一個節中的消耗，又將送去不少大好的金錢：而東西洋的巨商·大腹賈，却反捧腹大笑了·</p>
<p>本來，在國人心目中，對於端節，新年，和中秋，這是一年中最重視的三大節季：往往　許多人家，的們平常很是節儉，但到節上却也要豪奢一番，請客呀！家宴呀！大吃一頓，並且還要送禮，成了一種牢不可破的習慣。而在這吃的。送的之中，却正是往往在做「洋貨推銷員」？像洋貨的烟酒呵！舶來的糖果·餅乾·罐頭食品呵！於我們的記憶中，不是都在這節中，正是它盛銷的時候嗎？所以，在今天，我還要鄭重地向大家提出兩個希望：第一是要大家努力提倡國貨禮品，再不要將洋貨送給人家，致被人家輕視自己同時也侮辱了人家。我們是中國人，怎麼可用洋貨來禮尙往來呢！第二是要大家努力提倡國貨飲食，無論在節宴中，請客時，千萬不要再採用舶來的，而在貪圖口腹之中，就糊裏糊塗做龐大入超的製造者，亡國破家的罪魁，這是我所最馨香祝禱的。</p>
<p>看月兒高高掛在天空，皎潔可愛，我願今天大家把愛月的心，更愛到精美的國貨上來。並且，在今天，大家也正可想想，「學生國貨年」又降臨到了秋季，時代的輪子，已快把他輾去了三分之二的日子：我們　得自已檢討一下，在過去八個月中，我們對於國貨運動的工作，是否努力，推行國貨的功效，有否成績？我想這是很有意義的。</p>
<p>今夜的月色，是最光明不過的，但我更願今年我們提倡國貨的成績，將更成國貨史上最燦爛的一頁，</p>
<h3>送禮與國貨</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>梧桐樹上的蟬聲，漸漸地和人們吿別了。樹枝上的葉子，也漸漸由靑靑的而轉變為枯黃的了。天氣告訴我們說：「時候已是入於秋的季節了。」在這新秋降臨的時候，一般人最忙的一伴事，除了準備秋天的衣衫物品之外，恐怕中秋的送禮，也算一伴很够人麻煩的事吧。</p>
<p>送禮，原來是人與人之間一件正當的交際，我們對於送禮的本身問題，絲毫沒有什麼可以非議；不過，我們所認為有討論價值的，有研究必要的，是在送禮的實質問題。換一句話說：我們對於朋友親戚間的送禮，應該送些什麼東西，揀怎樣的東西去送贈？才是合理，才是正當，這是在送禮之先，應該注意到的一個問題。</p>
<p>現在，時候已是到了中秋送禮的時節了，許多人大家都在預備着送禮。報紙上的廣吿，以及大街小巷中的旗幟，一古腦兒的都被秋季大减價，和中秋送禮的字樣點綴着。</p>
<p>然而我們對於中秋的送禮。究竟怎樣辦呢？就我看來，送禮的人以及受禮的人，必須要注意下面兩個原則：</p>
<p>（甲）送國貨的禮品——送禮這一件事，表面上看來，似乎是個人的小事，但仔細想來，於國計民生，民族前途，實有極大的關係。當此社會經濟非常拮据，國內工商業如此不景氣的時候，我們送禮務須以國貨為百標。例如中秋的送禮，食品方面，應該送冠牛園泰康…公司的月餅，禮物方面，應該送中國國貨公司的禮券，或三友實業社的禮券等。這樣的送禮，一方面是推銷國貨，替垂危的國貨界，打開一條生路，同時，也大大可以的表示出送禮的人，是一個愛國的同胞呢。</p>
<p>（乙）受國貨的禮品——送禮的意義，一方面固然是把禮品贈給親戚朋友，同時，在受的人方面說來，是接受別人的誠意，接受親戚朋友的東西。所以，在受禮的人，固然應該以國貨的東西，為送禮的標準，而在受禮的人，也應該時時刻刻注意到送來的東西，是不是國貨。就我的意見說來，我們對於國貨的禮品，大可以謝而受之，而對於非國貨的禮品，應該抱謝而却之的態度，（注意：在拒絕禮物的時候，應該說明拒絕的理由，使送禮的人，知道拒絕的理由，這樣，他下次送起禮來，一定屏棄洋貨而採辦國貨了。）大家都能這樣，大家都能抱這種爽直的態度，我相信，其收效一定是非常偉大的。</p>
<p>總而言之，中秋是一個送禮的時節，我很希望大家多多採用國貨，購辦國貨，替垂危的國貨事業，創造一個活躍的姿態；那末，中秋這個佳節，也未始不是一個國貨前途轉變到好的情形的時節呢。</p>
<h3>一得之言</h3>
<p>— 涂紅霞</p>
<p>現在一部分的靑年，購買物品的時候，只知道漂亮，美觀，絕對不會顧及到是國貨還是外貨？</p>
<p>購買外貨的人，最遲早要受良心制裁的，良心的制裁，是永久，是制裁人的精神的。較之法律暫時制裁人的形體，其痛苦要增加千百倍。</p>
<p>購買一件外貨，而能立刻天良發現的人，和始終不悔悟，或悔悟而不澈底的人我們可以很簡單的批評一句：「前者是知恥的君子，後者是不知恥的小人。」</p>
<p>鄉村裏的人，不知道有外國貨，都市裏的人，不知道有中國貨；所以談到愛國，還是鄉村裏的人來得眞摯！</p>
<p>地方越偏僻，外賃越稀少；反之，越繁華的地方，外貨越多。在表而上好像交通的便利與閉塞，關係外貨的充斥與否？其實不然。因為繁華的地方，人們的「虛榮心太甚，所以外貨的銷路廣大，說來說去，還是「虛榮心害了人。</p>
<h3>讀「布畫」後希望中國綢廠</h3>
<p>— 孟昭</p>
<p>舊雨范烟橋君，撰「布畫」一文於報端。他說：在六七十年前，蘇州有一個畫家，嘗試用洋布作畫，却吿成功的，並引葉調生的鷗陂漁話說：「余偶以洋布極細密者，索顏朗如作墨山水。朗如言，其質較組稍堅，視宣紙則和潤，頗能發筆墨之趣，而氣韻又覺醇雅，同人咸以為新奇可喜」云云。末了，老友獨鶴先生說：「用布作畫，假定是可能的，最好用中國布，否則等於寫字用洋紙一樣，又要多一種漏巵了。」獨鶴之言甚是，引起我寫此篇的動機來。</p>
<p>我以為「布畫」，固然要用中國布，但是現在蠶絲價，也賤到了極點，國貨工廠如美亞等，也不妨聯絡中西著名畫家，計劃出畫布尺幅分寸，用絲紗夾織，務要做到光緻易落筆，能够保存到幾百年而不壞！無論油畫，山水畫，定比宣紙等好得多，名畫與名織品相輝映，恰如錦上添花！不獨行銷國內，國外展覽和推銷的成功，可操左券！而國貨織物，多一出路，中國綢廠當局，易不興起？</p>
<h3>在鄕村中提倡國貨的幾個要點</h3>
<p>— 陸叔昂</p>
<p>有人說：在鄉村中不必大聲疾呼的提倡國貨，因為鄉下老百姓，着的是自織的士布，吃的是自種的米麥，住的是自蓋的茅屋；旣享受不到外來的香水花粉，也夢想不到歐美的鮮艷綢緞，更希望不着外洋的山珍海味；他們所衣的，食的，住的，都是國貨，用不到我們再去提倡。這幾句話，說得都切合事實，但以吾看來，鄉村中不能說沒有洋貨的足跡，不過比較少些耳。若他們口頭所常常喊出的洋紗，洋綫，洋油，洋釘，洋松，洋火等等，已洋洋大觀了。吾現在把此較重要而要注意的幾點來說說。</p>
<p>第一為棉紗　鄉人對於棉紗的認識，不論國產，外貨，統稱為洋紗。棉紗在鄉村中推銷極廣，因為鄉間婦女，農隙之際，沒有一人不從事織布的，雖尙有自紡棉紗的，然究占用途的少數，因其費時太多。鄉人購買棉紗，鮮有注意到是否國貨者，國產棉紗的不能暢銷，此為一大原因。各廠紗包內本有根優美的商標，倘全國紗廠，能聯合起來，將這商標印成月份牌方式，凡國產的棉紗，其名稱，支數，商標式樣，無不列入，分送內地，使鄉民一望而知其某紗某廠，都是國產，智識份子，亦有依據，可以從旁指導，此種辦法，所費小而收效實大。照目前情形，不但鄉民辨不出若為國產，若為外貨，卽熱心提倡者，亦無所依據也。</p>
<p>第二為肥料　向來農民所採用的肥料，不外草肥，獸肥，人糞，豆餅，菜餅，花餅，等幾種。自人造肥料出世後，鄉人取其便利而價低，競相採用。嗚呼！愚昧的鄉民，只知目前，怎顧將來？農村已破敗到這樣地步，再加以鉅大的外來肥料侵入，其禍害豈堪設想？是以對於關係重大的肥料問題，一方面希望農業專家，加以深切的研究，改良農人所最需要的肥料，一方面希望負指導農民責任的同志，痛切說明其利害，不要輕視我國固有的肥料，更不宜貪一時少數的便宜，為其利誘，為之推銷提倡。</p>
<p>第三為建築材料　鄉間房屋，不若都市的高大，且都係平房，我國固有的木材，儘够應用。要領導鄉民注意這點，應先從學校和機關做起。然試觀現在內地的各種建築物，大部份不是國產材料，損失之大，不可計算。吾深慨乎此，是以最　建造一所千元左右的，舍，除大家認為沒有辦法，採用三根外來材料外！不敢諱言然已損失二十餘元！其餘完全用國產。這個問題，目前大家還少注意，故特表而出之。尤其希望天天高喊提倡國貨熱心愛國的教育界同志，要來頒導農民，做個好榜樣。</p>
<p>第四為香烟　吾對於農民，總是這樣說，吸烟是有害的，如必要吸烟，還是用中國舊式的水烟旱烟。然而事實確不是如此。小小一個市鎭，紙烟的銷路，一日之間，要有數百匣之多。或談話時，或作工時，或行走時，常有許多人吸着紙烟，不以為奇。而考究其所吸之烟，大都又是外貨，不但勞働界如此，卽智識份子，亦多喜吸外烟。吾並不提倡吸紙烟，但事實旣不易勸阻，惟有希望吸烟的人們，至少限度，要吸中國烟。吾持此說，必然受人非議，不過就事論事，目的在多推銷一些國貨，為國家多留一分元氣而已。</p>
<p>吾天天和農民一同過生活，所見所聞，比較確切，故提出上面四個問題，以供熱心提倡國貨者做參考。倘能引起大家的注意，一方面宣傳，一方而改淮，對於國貨的推銷，必可受到極大影饗。並且還可明白提倡國貨，不宜僅注重於都市，廣大的農村，恐怕比都市尤為重要。今後倘能在內地多舉行國貨巡迥展覽，必能喚起多數民衆愛用國貨的熱忱，以逹到推銷國貨的最大目的。</p>

<p>標紗前市開盤、本月突見疲勢、因長豐賡豐兩號獨賣、據云有十七支紗交解、故堅硬之九月期、忽形軟化、但拍至遠月、略為緊俏、因邇來現紗客銷起色、有一部分人心傾向做多、漲四·五角、旋至二三盤、以本月期無力、市情疲憊、遠月牽入下游、結果本月份比上日收盤價跌七角、遠跌而·四角、午後開盤尚帶堅昂、聞上午現紗成交尚在一千包光景、拍至二三盤、據日方消息、靑島價趨落、且該處存紗濃厚、故日商心思看低、結果近平、遠跌二·三角、查賣出同孚四百包、錦昌三百五十包、賡豐一千二百包、森康三百包、同和三百包、信誠一千一百五十包、大孚四百包、通記五百包、益昶七百五十包、長豐六百包、買進瑞大一千三百五十包、同豐四百五十包、慎記九百包、仁豐六百五十包、益昶四百五十包、大豐五百五十包、達記三百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列左、</p>

<h3>新花登場標棉平弱</h3>
<p>棉市始漲繼跌、趨勢尙堅、以美棉產額减縮、市價上昇、印棉漲風亦熾、致多方安然不動、午後聞各路新棉一致上市、目出貨日湧、紗廠停頓者迄今仍無開工消息、消費缺乏、市情乃轉衰弱、</p>

<p>昨美棉開盤、市况較活、因利物浦堅定、同業及利物浦買進、棉區大部有雨、各月漲五至十磅音、套賣不多、現貨頗有脚地、買戶方面、恐天晴後套賣增加、依然觀望、其後因本地帮賣出、一部份發現回風、終以空戶抵補及紐奧崙買進、又復回昂、計現貨漲十磅音、期貨漲九至十四磅音、英棉現貨漲三點、期貨漲一點、印棉先因空戶抵補及期貨商買進而堅、後因歐洲出口商跨賣略回、計平果爾漲二羅比、奧姆辣漲四·七五羅比、白羅溪漲五·二五羅比、原電錄左、（十日電）</p>

<h3>糧食　業外囤戶突起暢辦　期粉麥一致昂騰</h3>
<p>粉昨日粉市突起變化、自晨間開市後、近遠各月份一律上升、近期以各廠存底不豐、而實銷又見活動、遠月統　業外囤戶暢辦所激起、廠方拋套逐步减少、昨日出胃完全停止、又以洋麥步漲、故市上人心大部看好、一經大戶收買買風更旺、全日成交數亦逾六十萬包以上、浮空抵補亦為有力、遠月被囤買與抵補爭辦、市氣史俏、收價本月十一月各大二分、十月大一分半、十二月大二分半、一月大三分半、二月大三分、</p>
<p>麥昨日麥市晨開市後、以洋麥報價續漲、美麥漲一二角、檻麥漲二三角、且尚在濃續望好中、因此行販賣戶均為觀望、而浮空抵補與業外囤戶突起活踡、遠月買氣更旺、蓋以國麥存底已枯、洋麥始終難定、大衆心思均　看好、遠月尤為囤戶注意、收市價一月份飛升一角、十二月漲八分、九十月各大五分、十一月大四分、現麥貨主本為望好、今以粉市活潑、喊高一角、以致廠方嫌大未曾妥交、即有少數行販配廠者、亦極為細云、</p>

<h3>本米行市已見堅穩</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各幫來源仍祗到十二三號（貨共二千四五百石）市面平定見緊張、本街銷化難暢、包胃昨抵青島幫辦百餘包、人心已穩、故若各頗粳及薄稻價、結果定中已有同起數分者、而各新粳更以高貨缺乏轉上一二角、僅中關者較為見定、至如洋川等新尖及團尖等、遂皆續　數分至一角、陳陰變元、仍以銷呆滯疲近尺、（附吿）今日荳米行南北市各同業因秋節從事大結束特各休業一天故無市、</p>

<h3>客秈下疲洋米勉站</h3>
<p>昨客秈續到、適在中秋節邊貨主多願隨市脫手、而進戶並不食　、目河下米　　　　　　　辦胃更淡、故客秈高次各檔績見疲小五六分、全日開出甬秈六百多包、京糙二百包、由本街與北洋分去、</p>
<p>洋米浮存已稀、行囤仍主擯守、故市面已可站定、昨客秈雖疲、洋米依然立定、惟市上少數浮存及由外埠退還者多隨市脫手、昨售開西貢暹邏各米二千多包、價與前市相似、亦為北洋帮與本街分去、</p>

<h3>茶市愈趨沉靜</h3>
<p>昨洋莊茶市、愈趨沉　、歐美各莊行家、對於市上剩存之珍眉蝦目各種綠茶、上遇雖均發出大批電報、但杳無回音、形勢非常不利、昨僅祗恊和福時同孚錦隆等行、買進珍眉鳳眉秀眉等貨、共計二百餘箱、均係補充缺額性質、並無躉批需要、市盤一致趨跌、</p>

<h3>五金　節前五金愈形呆滯</h3>
<p>廢曆中秋節已屆、五金交易愈形呆滯、因此市塲上除收賬者較形忙碌外、買賣一項殊無足記、惟各貨行情以到貨寥少、尙覺挺硬、如會司鐵馬口鐵平白鐵新鉛絲剪口鐵新洋元竹節鋼條工字鐵等各花色均有繼續看好之勢、惟客戶因銀根緊急、無力添辦、實交在擯持停頓狀態、故昨除開出七八百担外、殊未聞有大批之訂交者、據熟悉五金內幕者云、茍節後銀根稍鬆、出路方面、定有可觀、况到源斷檔、存貨有被購告罄之勢、則市面之欣欣向榮、定可預卜也云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　新生仁首批登場</h3>
<p>生仁首批新貨、有臨淮關仁八包到申、貨品尙佳、當為本街帮辦去、約價十元、頗覺稀罕、但數少不足視為正市、並據靑島電訊、該處生仁亦已見新、現貨為八元、後市防鬆、</p>

<h3>五四的霉菌</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>自由神那影片的故事，托始於五四時代的學生運動。影片中杭州學生聯合會辦公處的簡陋和女學校教室的狹小，我看了不禁失笑。作者心目中的五四運動人物，大概都是新式的英雄，眞肯刻苦為社會犧牲；英雄的對手——美人也必產生於簡陋的教室中。談說「五四」故事的人，右的是身與其事的；他們為着保持自己的榮譽和地位，當然不肯說穿內幕。有的是得之傳聞的，總以為那麼光榮的社會運動，參加那運動的人總必是光明磊落的，可是事實上是凡是我們現在所聽到所看見的卑鄙手腕，在那時早已其體而微地試用着；霉菌是在五四時代下了種子的。</p>
<p>以自由神所說的杭州學生聯合會而論，應該是一所富麗的小洋房；那洋房現在依舊是杭州新市塲北角上第一等好房子。而很少的幾個女學生代表，都是橫河橋邊上大觀園中的「美人」。我吿訴你一件小事：就州學生聯合會的代表往來滬杭，坐的都是頭等車，全國學生聯合會的代表到杭州來，住的是新新旅館（杭州最闊的旅館），吃的是聚豐園，坐的是包車；這樣我們可以明白學生會有那麼富麗的會所並不足為奇了。（北京的學生代表，每天時常有十來處飯局，比國會議員還要闊，那更不必說。）</p>
<p>當時的實情是如此：有些政治上的人物，比較明自時代趨勢的，他們知道這新生的羣衆運動，勢力大不可侮，想設法利用來做他的政治活動的後盾。利用的方式很多，用金錢來收買必然是第一件同有的事。學生會代表賣身投靠的方式很多，但不一定比當時那些猪仔議員純瀿一點。種種錯綜捭闔的把戲，只要我們在政治舞台上可以找到的，在學生聯合會裏一樣可以找到。自然在講台上慷慨激昂痛哭流涕的玩意兒，也和一般政客一樣的穿了各種外套扮演出來。那些學生代表，手法玩得高妙一點的，就做了時勢所產生的英雄。南宋周密齊東野語記南宋的游士：（當時的大學生）「多無檢東，羣居率以私喜怒軒輊人。甚者以植黨撓官府之政，叩閽攬黜陟之權，或受賂覥詆朝紳，或設局騙脅民庶。」五四時代的學生代表，這幾句話可以約略包括了。</p>
<p>但是，大家不要因為我揭穿了學生代表　的黑暗面，就蔑視五四運動的時代意義。五四運動顯示時代靑年的光明迫求，顯示小市民的反抗意識，掀起中華民族求解放的巨浪。所以我們應向這一而去注意，而千萬不要看重那幾個滿身霉菌，時勢所造成的英雄！</p>
<p>因此自由神那影片，完全是理想主義的。</p>
<h3>野原</h3>
<p>— 勞心</p>
<p>當我給盧偽的人們激刺得受了傷的時候，要是會把我原來和野獸一模一樣的野性勃發起來的。於是憤怒，鬰悶，而至狂吼般嗥叫。然而，我是明白我的地位是如何地渺小，弱者的呼號是永遠得不着回響的，因此我雖然眼看着那無恥而又卑鄙的敵人——一匹豺狼，它在張牙舞爪地裝成了那勝利的得意的模樣，我也一般地沉默着，不作聲。正如忍受着這百度以上的苦熱的太陽力一樣地忍受着。</p>
<p>可是，我也是一個血肉的動物，而且我也會如一般斯文的紳士們所詆毀過的野蠻種族一樣地沒有理性的野蠻過，我怎可以給困着在沉默的籠子里哪。親愛的朋友，你是明白我的，我們曾經有過一個時侯是怎樣娛快地處理着我們的生活啊。你說，在這樣的一個時候里，你叫我怎能不想起了你。</p>
<p>對的，你曾對我說過叫我不要想你，你也曾勸勉過我在這虛偽的社會里不要太認眞，你　曾教我對付那些虛偽傢伙的許多方法，你也千囑萬咐地叫我不要太暴噪，和從前一樣。一切的一切我都依了你，然而在這于年，事實是會給我一點什麼好處哩，你用來誘惑我的「那一天」，我們還連影子也看不到一點哩，而我的曾受過箭傷的胸膛，血漬還未乾涸的時候又染上了第二箭了，你叫我怎可以再忍耐，你又叫我怎樣不再想起你咧。</p>
<p>然而，無論在什麼時候我還是相信你的話的，而且我始終沒有走過和我們在野原里海濱里所交付的將來相反的路，道個你可以到末後也可以相信我的。</p>
<p>『你看蒼鷹，它是那樣地飛翔着；你看浪花，它還是接二連三地不斷地盡了它微弱的力量和責任。我們，我們難還該象豺狼一樣地奸詐，欺騙着人類，欺騙着朋友，欺騙着自己嗎？不，我們决不！……」</p>
<p>我們决不！對的，親愛的朋友，我相信你的，請你也和我相信你一樣地相信我。然而，你又會想到我和你分別以後，我像蒼鷹那樣不埋怨地飛翔着，又像浪花那樣不退縮地番動着，在這樣的時候我的胸膛的戰傷却從未乾個過，然而，相信我的一對有力的臂膀還一樣地可以負我們負上的責任。……但是，這怎能叫我不想起你咧？我知道，你是更有力而且自信，我知你也决不會走那在野原里在海濱上所交付的將來相反的路；你會記起，我們已經一年沒有見面了，也許我們都淸瘦了吧。這怎能叫我不想起你哪，當我身邊滿佈着可怕而又奸詐的豺狼的時候？</p>
<p>也許是夢吧，在這樣的一個沒有月亮的夏夜里，我又再次踏進我們相唔過的野原里了。可親愛的野原，還是一樣，一片廣漠，除了一些不知名的小東西在黑暗里摸索之外，便再不看見別的什麼東西。近海濱的一塊石上，是會經有遇我們的印跡的，我在那里坐了和我們那時候坐的那許多時侯。蒼鷹還是沒有埋怨的飛翔着，浪花還是那樣不退縮的前進着，然而石上却只剩得了我。你咧，朋友？你到了什麼地方去了？你的周圍全是豺狼嗎？</p>
<p>便中吿訴你：野原是無恙的。</p>
<h3>車站附近</h3>
<h3>這里是上海（上）</h3>
<p>— 東籬</p>
<p>這里是上海，是××路××　大厦二百〇四號。房間一共兩小間連在一起，月租銀子二百兩，合銀元二百六七十元呢。主人藍眼珠黃頭髮，他自己說是美國人，但有時又自稱是英國人，年紀在三十歲左有。穿一身挺呌響的西裝，不，不只是『一身」呌響的西裝，而應該說每次穿的一身西裝都是很呌響的。你們明白了吧？再說一句，他每套西裝都是很漂亮的，不僅西裝呌響而已，那光亮得連蒼蠅落上去都要跌交的「拔佳」皮鞋，那同樣可以使一個蒼蠅滑交的油光的頭髮，還有那一副修整的面孔，白白的臉皮——都在表明他是一個美男子。他是作什麼的呢？你們一定要問了，那就吿訴你們罷，他是一個醫生。說得再角切一點，他是畫花柳的醫生，還可以說是專替我們的高等姨太太們醫花柳病的外國醫生。</p>
<p>門外，一個中英文全有的洋瓷脾子探出長長的脖子，英文字母是速成很長的一串，字母有高有低的。中文××××頓。下面注明是德國和比國的醫學博士。跟你們說，你們若是白大來看病，那才算　霉頭，自碰釘子，因為這位德比醫學博士診病的時間是定在夜里的。覺着奇怪麼？用不到那樣，如果你們相信醫生的醫道旣然各有巧妙不同，同樣應診時間定在夜里是沒有什麼不可以的。夜里，不正是姨太太們出來冶遊的時間麼。</p>
<p>講起生意，難然說不上門庭若市（這裏是大厦，照理說也不容許有市，）但你總可說看病的人是絡繹不絕的。這些主顧們，哼，常她們坐着黑牌白字的福特八缸轎車或是別克新車來到大厦門口時，那看門的紅頭阿三才够恭敬呢，很小心地趕過去打開車門，彎身行禮。她們不是太太便是小姐，由於她們那隨身飄蕩着的香氣，你絕對不會想到她們的身上還有某一部分染上了一個待治療的污點。但這又有什麼要緊呢，病畏在她們這流人的身上本不算一回事，要醫治，有一疊一疊的鈔票用！再說，這病說起來不是也很好聽麼。呌什麼——啊，呌什麼「風流症」吧？不，還有一個時髦的名字，不是你們也知道麼，呌作「文明病」的？到底是文明人才長得用「文明病，」我們高攀不來。單只說我們的衣著就　開「文明」兩字遠得根呢。」</p>
<p>她們走在甬道上時，高跟鞋踏着水門汀地發出淸脆的響聲，大衣，旗袍幾重衣服悉索地響着，她們的精神都是十足的，但是。一等到走進這位大醫學博士的門口時，就另變成一秤樣子；以前，她們是目空一切的怪傑，這一時却要向醫生說好話買好了。就是這樣大醫生的臉還少有發笑的時候。說到大醫生的醫費，自然很大，並且還不能馬虎一文錢，一馬虎，就顯出生意不振地位低下了。所以，打一針六〇六，頂賤的價錢還要二十五元，說起來比藥價不知實到多少倍。哪　話，這並不算貴，博士和他的主顧都在想：藥錢賤的醫生是自不好病的。</p>
<p>現在，都市的高樓巨　把西方還有一丈多高的太陽給遮住了，這×××大厦里已然開始了夜生活。這位德比醫學博士坐一部最新的「司蒂增克」轎車來到大厦門外了。進部車子是兩月前一個讓他醫好初期花柳病的某公館三姨太太送過來的。進車子的喇叭才有越呢，撳起來有兩三種聲責　騷刀米騷。當大醫生神神氣氣走進自己的診室坐定之後，眼望着明亮的燈光，內心里不由就想到近幾天遭逢到的一件艷遇。請想想，這樣一位大醫生，夜夜和他的女主顧往還，機會不是很多麼。雪茄在他的手指中夾着，輕輕散着烟。侍褚已經把屋子打抪乾凈了。他沒有助手，一個人裏外照顧着。其實他道里也不需多餘的人，來的主顧旣然不掛號，打針手續也不複雜，何况他醫病的手法只是千篇一律打針那一件事。打針，針費大有不同，二十五元一針，五十元一針，還有一百元一針的。</p>
<p>天已然全黑了，屋子里的燈光更顯得亮了些，左近無綫電播昔機正在播送着女腔歌曲。甬道處傳來一陣皮鞋聲，大醫生的遐想給打斷了。他猜得出道一定是自己的主顧來了。一點沒有錯，皮鞋聲止在他的門口，有人，在門上扣門了。</p>

<p>二三年前×部長的一位小姐失踪了，×部長自然急得非凡，夫人哭，鬧，餓，拼命，原因是只有這一位掌上珍，×部長的公事都忘了，這是為私而忘公的精神的表現。每日只在家中乾急，警察局聽說是×部長的小姐失了踪，自然是大批探捕出發，然而訪了許久，仍是消息毫無。急得沒有辦法，碰巧之來找到這位趙神仙。趙大麻子由秀才而變為神仙，也有個小小典故的。原來一個大熱的天，別人都在街巷口乘凉，趙大麻子可就和別人不同，他穿起夾衣關了門，在屋子裏，人家笑他有些痴氣。不一會兒，誰知烏雲四佈，大雨傾盆，冷得異常，大家方嘆趙大麻子確有先見之明。</p>
<p>自這事發生之後，趙大麻子素性大吹大擂，口口聲聲說自己會相面，會算命，會起皇極神數，還會……，也是他運氣來到了，居然有許多被他說得一中二着，打道兒起儼然自以為像活神仙一個樣般，C鎭上的人也以為顯黨顯聖，都不呌他趙大麻子；，而改口呌他趙大神仙，他還常常地答應着，：嗯！當十部長派了汽車到C鎭上，可把趙大麻子嚇昏了呦，臉蛋兒白得沒了血。</p>
<p>「這……這是甚麽東西？我的天喲！」</p>
<p>「回神仙的話，這是汽車，部長派來接神仙的。」兩個衛兵舉手行禮向趙大麻子這樣的說。</p>
<p>趙大麻子的身子不由得連退了兩退，他當是大兵不該他說那話，舉手打他呢，後來聽淸是接他的　又稱他是神仙，便不由得膽壯了。</p>
<p>過了幾天，趙大麻子回來了，部長的女見找到沒有找到，人家不燒得，可是趙大麻子却更一變而為C鎭的紅人，全鎭人去歡迎他不計外，並且警察局也替他放起鞭炮來。趙大麻子眞威風，眞抖，單看他去的時候一套衣裳，和回來的一套衣裳，都够使人眼睛紅。從此趙大麻子在C鎭上更肆無忌憚了。</p>
<h3>夢（一）</h3>
<p>— 臧克家</p>
<p>光芒寒短的冬陽離西邊的地平綫丈來高了。在這慕地裏，陰森森的古柏却更早的攏來了暮色。烏鵲喳喳地從四邊的天際向這兒打旋，一個個的窩巢挑在百尺的自揚上被晚風吹得一擺一搖的像在向它們的主人招呼。</p>
<p>看林的王二嫂子揚開半截毛草劈拉笆門子向外一探頭，一陣冷風又把她噎回去了。「是時候了」她想著便二次衝出門來小跑著向東邊的小草塲上抱了一抱松枝，風把她吹到門裏去了。</p>
<p>鍋裏添兩瓢水，溜上幾僩紅餅子，預備丈夫好回來。吃晚飯，是的，該是回來的時候了。外面的風這麼大，他溜明穿一件翅薄老套子襖，這時一定很冷。想著，她自己身上打了一個寒戰。</p>
<p>松枝在鍋底下，畢凹的響，松令子燒得像一個火球。她坐在一堪木板上，屢　　著，眼盯住火頭，呌它正　著鍋底中心。忽然，左眼皮跳起來了，她一經覺到，一種憂煩和恐懼，便抓住了她的心。她迷信這個，好似迷信夜貓子（注）的呌聲能給人帶來不幸一樣。她明自有點不祥的什麼要迫近來，經騐吿訴過她，道一點也不含糊。可是她不敢向道方面想。用手折斷一根松針濕上了點嘩沫壓在跳著的眼皮上，可憐的自哄自的向好處圖：「右眼跳喜，左眼跳食，」她用祈禱一般的低聲說著。可是這松針一點也不管事，好似一個巫女降不了作崇的妖精。她心下更煩而害怕的成分也頓然擴大起來。她歎一口氣，眼還是叮著鍋底心的火，火紅紅的像魔鬼的舌頭向她伸縮著，道道增加了她的害怕。她為了制止自己的心，合上了眼數著一呼吸眼皮跳動的次數，一下兩下：她默默的祈禱着皂王呌它漸漸的平靜下來。誰也不知道她的眼閉了多少時，而越數次數越多她自己却數得千眞萬確。早晚鍋裏的沸永騰騰的呌，才把她的雙眼拉開了。</p>
<p>『怪不得昨天夜裏做郝樣一個夢哩。」她心裏又把夜來的夢和現在眼皮的跳拉在一起了。『兩個居天立地的大黑漢子，抬頭望不見臉，只覺得一邊「隻蒲扇的大手狠狠的捉住我的手，一掣，我覺得澈心的痛，便倒在血裏了，早晚暈過來，那兩個大人早沒影了；自己却成了沒有路膀的一個血肉糢糊的肉蛋。」夢　來，全身的肉　哆梭，心更不用提了。連丈夫也沒敢開口吿訴他，一想起來就彷彿看見那兩條漢子站在臉前。</p>
<p>她本是胆子正當的；終年處在這陰氣迫人的古墓間聽白揚的簫肅，從沒感到壓這或寂實，今天可不行了。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>美共黨撕毀德輪國旗案的判决</h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>事情離現在不久，大家想遷記得七月二十六日，美國會發生一件共產黨員撕毀德國輪船國旗案。綠是日德國大郵船「白里門」號，將由紐約啟椗駛回歐洲時，突有美國共產黨員，　擁上船，舉行反國社主義示威運動，並將船上德國國旗扳去，擲入海中，德國大使遂向國務院銀出抗議，在場有多人被捕。當時會掀起一點微波，觀察者預料結局美政府必能對暴徒判些罪，以平德憤慨。那知事情竟出乎意料之外，這案件巳於近日由法院審理，認被捕五罪，卽日釋放。不但如此，更奇怪的是，紐約地方法院法官白羅咨基，審理之時，並申斥希特勒政治，指「白里門」號為懸掛黑色盜旗的盜船，謂卍字旗之飛揚於紐約港中，被吿等或視為興美利堅主義相敵對的象徵。惟他聲明他所言者，並不作庇護暴動之解云，只第六被吿一人，執有軍火，未領護照，略受處分。</p>
<p>國社主義與共產主義為死對頭，發生衝突，勢所必然。但美國共產黨員舉行反國社主義示威運動，而至於撕破德國國旗，投入海中，這對於德國顯然是一種侮辱。蓋國旗卽國家的代表，侮辱國旗，也等於侮辱國家。要是這案件發生在別的比德國弱的國家，說不定會因此引起一個重大的糾紛。好在美國現在比德國還有勢力，故德國只能提出抗議而已，也無奈他何。殊不知這案不判猶可，一判更使德國難堪。法官白羅咨基幾句話，實在說的太過火。　字旗在德人眼中看來，是何等的尊嚴。白氏竟指為海盜標識，且謂該旗之飄揚於紐約港中，被吿或視為與美利堅主義相敵對的象徵。這種處置，怪不得德國要大為震怒，認為對於德國的極大侮辱。聞這事德國各報，甚望美政府能取必要步驟，以糾正此項侮辱友邦的行動。而德國駐美大使，亦已向美國務院提出口頭抗議，大使事後不允發表交涉眞相，但云這次談話頗有趣味云。這確是國際關係中一件別緻的事。</p>
<p>記得不久前，德元首希特勒，曾對國社黨員演說，謂以後五百年內，卐字旗在德國人民心裏，不能扳去。足見卍字旗在德國勢力，是如何雄厚。今不幸受美國這般侮辱，未知希氏將作何感想。</p>
<h3>筏</h3>
<p>— 羅之華</p>
<p>從鉅野縣往濟寗去，計算起來有九十里的路程，當中經過很少的市鎭，必須走完四十五里要才能到達嘉祥縣。</p>
<p>孫二那一夥將近十個人共同乘用的筏已經向前走了老半天，嘉祥縣的影子還沒看見，就是那一帶靑碧色的山嶺也望不到。四周全是沙黃的濁流，像陷在敵人的領土中，他們掙扎着，往前面走。但是他們測不出正確的方向跟路線，茫茫地往前面走。</p>
<p>站在筏尾的孫二，一個三十來歲的大漢子，跟小方兩個人，執爭篙，但是水的深度常常是勾不到底的。</p>
<p>孫二用捲好的袖子抹下額角的汗珠，回頭看他的夥伴們，疲倦好像一條鐵鍊，墮低下他們的頭的墮低下他們的眼皮。他把視線落到有名的慳吝人齊雅齊身上，齊雅齊穿着一身粗藍布長衫，頭戴黑緞子「帽墊」，戴着小片的眼鏡，一張信紙捏在手里，還有一個信封，塞在懷裏了。他坐在小包袱上，展讀他的信。孫二明白他在盤算到濟寗以後的事；就問他：齊大爺，你預備……」</p>
<p>猛古丁地聽到呼喚他，愛理不理地：「找親戚，找親戚，；……你哩？……」</p>
<p>「俺還有什麼指望，還不是去買力氣……」</p>
<p>說時篙向地下一觸，船向前進了，小方很憂愁地望向前方：怎麼還看不到那山嶺呢？連村落也沒有。</p>
<p>八十歲的老媽媽子宋嬸嬸，腿累得發麻，想站起來，脚小不得不能支持，再加上筏的掂簸頭有些暈眩，只好又坐下，閑煞眼睛，嘆聲氣。</p>
<p>挨她坐的是孫二家媳婦，年紀也不過二十來歲，跟前都已有三個孩子，懷裏的不過三來個月，近前蹲着的是兩生日的二孩子，再一個孩子也僅只三週歲的樣子。</p>
<p>「娘，我餓的慌！」大孩子抱住孫二媳婦的膝蓋低微地說。兩隻無神的眼睛帶着祈求和希望瞅娘的臉。這神氣叫作娘的心要起着一陣悲酸。眼看在家病瘦了，再加水來後的飢餓與恐懼，皮膚變作烟黃與鰲黑。跟死亡的距離恐怕不會太遠。她用手拍着剛剛睡在懷里的孩子，又來哄這兩個。孩子佔有了她生活的全部。</p>
<p>她被孩子說的想起來遠空著肚子。筏上的人全被孩子說的想起來還沒吃東西，但是，他們沒有方法來滿足自己的要求。</p>
<p>就在這時侯，小方用手指住左邊的遠方說：</p>
<p>「那邊還有屋子哩，說不定有人………」</p>
<p>筏轉了方向，走不多遠，已能看到有人影搖動；再向前就能够聽見呼喊的、聲音了。那是一座座房舍的頂子，有的已經塌去，只剩下棟樑，木經聯接這些房舍之間。人們就期待救生者的到來。筏走近這里的時候，齊雅齋拍拍腰裏的盒包，說：「要弄着飯吃俺姓齊的出錢！」兩隻眼滴溜溜地轉了好幾遭。孩子們的飢餓不曾被哄騙跑，老是吵吃東西，聽到齊雅齋的與奮的話，無神的眼裏也像增添了許多光彩。宋家嬸嬸，跟她的閨女，免强地站立住，別的人也都根新鮮似的注視這一片屋頂，和丢在身後的無力的沙黃的濁流。</p>
<p>但是，齊雅齋第一個失望了。他有錢買不出飯來：這里的人們也絕食幾天了。自然，一羣空肚子子的人都沉默住了。</p>
<p>「弟兄們講交精，這裏呆不住，咱都往濟寗去吧！」</p>
<p>齊雅齊反對似的對說話的一個傢伙說：「這可不行，這筏不結實，再上人還能行嗎？……」他認為錢是他拿木材作的，權利就當該屬於他。事實上，小方跟孫二都願意帶幾個人逃出這水圍住的災難，他也不能多問什麼了。筏是在兩天前紮好的，很結實，上去人並不顯得怎樣叫人擔心。齊雅齋答應能上來四個人。</p>
<p>路途是遠長的。……</p>
<p>前面的方黑胡胡的像是柳樹，長　那裏，成一圓形。孫二早就想到這一定是個深坑，把篙拿穩了，平安地何前進行。……</p>
<p>猛可地，當他把簡向水里挿時，一陣風旋着浪頭，筏身失了平衛，孫二的寵大體軀，栽向水裏去，筏上的人們被猛來的動作搖得失去注意力，小方跌坐在筏上，筏就在風的漩渦裏車軸似的轉，最胘和冰凉的水將他們淹埋住。……</p>
<p>後邊又過來幾隻黑的船影，也許是到濟寗去的，但是嘉祥的山巒還見不到彩子。</p>
<h3>博多</h3>
<p>— 元元</p>
<p>——東瀛游痕——</p>
<p>車到福岡的博多，那時天剛亮。因為未曾預先定旅館，大家便入車站的待合室中去，靜候引率者去辦旅館的交涉。</p>
<p>車站的待合室中佈置得很好，我坐在那舒服的沙發上，睡眼朦朧一心想睡。同行的有的未及在車中洗臉，見着待合室的鄰室寫着化裝室三字，便都去化裝了。化裝室裏面一切都很完備，佈置得也整潔；皮皂，木梳，一切零碎用具都有，實在於我們旅行者是很便利，於此也可見日本的國家是為國民辦一些事的。</p>
<p>一會，引導者在車站上備着的旅行指南中找定了一家旅館，便打電話去接洽。電話打去不久，旅館裏卽派了人來領我們。旅館中人穿着黑色的和服，態度的和氣，招待的殷勤，眞使我們驚異，我們見到了他的老老實實的容貌，不覺對他們的旅館憑空的起了信仰和好感。</p>
<p>我們跳進電車，在買票的時候，車夫都給我們各人一張，經引率者的說明，　知日　　他電　　　動　　　　　早上七時半前乘車的多給一張優待券這券在下午乘車時可用。公司的用意獎勵一般早起者，但能够受他們的優待，大槪是勞働者和學生。</p>
<p>下電車後穿過一個像古廟一樣的屋，出來便是一條很淸潔的柏油路，因為時侯尙早，往來的行人不多，但已很可見這興盛的地方，和長崎一比，眞有天壤之別。</p>
<p>旅館卽在我們穿過的古屋的對面。完全是一家日本式的旅館，門口只有一小方地，是可以不脫鞋踏上去。那一小方地便是預備我們把鞋脫下放在那裏，然後踏到他們離地約高一尺多的席地上去。</p>
<p>席地上跪着四五個穿得很整齊的下女，但歲數都已不小了。她們口中不住的說着歡迎話。為我們提小東西，引路。我們走到樓上，覺得暗沉沉十分的陰鬰，光綫不足，又兼之是帶黑色的木造屋。我們佔了二間房。房內佈置的簡單，使我起了一陣蕭條之感。一隻低脚桌，桌上一個電話分機；筆墨，硯，信紙。還有一面鏡子放在屋角；在這些上面，我門知道那雖不是貴族的旅館，却也不是　　的　大概　　　星　　　的　館，預備高尚的人住的。</p>
<p>早上還沒有吃過東西，大家便議定吃牛乳麵包。下女卽來為我們圍圍的放了十二個蒲團。我們便圍着坐起來下。女捧了茶跪進在中央，給我們分茶。日本式的兩膝盤曲坐着，本來是使心靜的一法，如今又得了一杯淸茶，一口口喝着，眞是別有風味。</p>
<p>博多地方最有名的出產是「人形」，人形實在便是我們說的泥菩薩，不過他們塑的不一定是佛菩薩，是很多樣式的，泥好，塗上的白粉和顏色也好。並且開臉有專門的人，他們和畫家一樣，不是隨隨便便畫上二條眉毛，二隻眼，一雙嘴便算事；他們塑時注意面部的曲綫，描貌時注意不相同的表情。那樣的「人形」自然有藝術上的價值的高低。</p>
<p>吃過午食後，我們在旅館附近找着了一爿人形店。那裏新式的人形很多。所謂新式的，是指近代服飾的塑像，或者也有塑西洋人形的，那些價值都很高，差不多每個要一元至三四元不等。我們見一個電影明星羅克的塑像，一看價目為二元，覺得太貴了。</p>
<p>中數生童的　　　個穿西裝的　子，非常殷懃等守着我們的挑選。問他價格時，總是諾諾連聲的吿訴我們。我看了多時，要買的人形，價目實在太貴了。不買又不好意思結果挑了價錢最低的一個可以掛的「懺悔時的耶穌的頭。一化五十錢，值中國的五毛大洋。</p>

<h3>The Dike of the Bulao River Breached</h3>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) According to the Flood Prevention Office, the dike of the Bulao River in Pixian County breached at noon on the 10th, flooding 47 villages and 12,000 hectares. (Special Dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Last night, a strong wind passed over Weishan Lake, with the wind blowing from east to west. The west dike of Weishan Lake was under pressure, and water seeped through five sections. Wang Gongdu urgently telegraphed the Anti-Yellow River Association to transport 1,000 sacks and supervised the reinforcement of the dike overnight. Fortunately, there was no accident. The wind has subsided this morning, and the dike is safe. After the breach in the lower reaches of the Bulao River in Tongdong, the water level at Jingshan Bridge is dropping. However, Pixian is under severe pressure due to the intense flooding. The large dike south of the city is still under construction, and Pixian City is still safe. (Special Dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) The western section of the water-retaining dam of the Shuangjinzha Shuishiba in Yangzhuang, Huaiyin, which is over three zhang high, collapsed into the water on the night of the 8th due to the high top load and heavy soil, resulting in broken piles and cables. At the same time, the eastern dam was also affected by the rapid current. After the authorities hired divers to investigate, they found that the foundations were stable and there were no capillary holes. Over the past few days, they have been rushing to use forty zhang long hemp ropes in pairs, plus four waistbands, to secure all sides, which has stabilized it. Rumors that the eastern dike was torn and in danger of collapsing are inaccurate. (Special Dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) Huaiyin is suffering from drought and the weather is very hot. The thermometer reads 91 degrees, unlike late autumn. (Special Dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) Today, the micro-water level dropped by 9 centimeters, remaining at 36.877 meters. The Yao涨 increased by 7 inches, remaining at 243 inches.

<p>(Nanjing) Xu Kai, the chief engineer of the Huai River Conservancy Commission, returned to Nanjing after inspecting the water situation in northern Jiangsu. He said that the entire river system in northern Jiangsu is now a diversion route for the floodwaters from the Yellow River breach. All rivers are eroding the banks. The dikes of the Grand Canal and the Bulao River above Pixian have already breached, turning the area into a swamp. The lower Grand Canal and the Liutang River are also in critical condition. Fortunately, officials and civilians in various counties are doing their best to protect them. Northern Jiangsu is not yet completely submerged, but if the Yellow River breach is not quickly blocked, the disaster area will expand and it will be difficult to avoid. I will report this to the Economic Committee in detail. The construction of the Huai River ship lock project is still continuing. Embankments have been added around each ship lock for protection, so there is no danger. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 11th)</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang's Proclamation on Reorganizing the Monetary System of Sichuan Province</h3>
<p>(Chengdu) The monetary system in Sichuan Province has been chaotic for a long time, and the suffering of the people of Sichuan is profound. Chairman Chiang issued a proclamation on the 10th, ordering the full recovery and destruction of all local banknotes. Starting from September 15th, all public and private transactions in Sichuan Province will be based on the Central Bank's banknotes. Local banknotes will be exchanged for Central Bank banknotes at a rate of 8 yuan for every 10 yuan. The exchange is limited to be completed by November 20th. All recovered local banknotes will be publicly destroyed. Sichuan silver coins will be assayed for their fineness and exchanged for Central Bank banknotes accordingly. At the highest, the exchange rate for Sichuan local banknotes has reached over 700 yuan per 1,000 yuan, and at the lowest, it has been over 100 yuan. On average, the price of local banknotes is about 250 yuan lower than Central Bank banknotes per 1,000 yuan. Moreover, local banknotes cannot represent Sichuan currency due to the exchange rate spread, and the fineness of Sichuan currency is about 5% worse than that of national currency. Local banknotes are now being exchanged for Central Bank banknotes at 80% of their face value, which is a measure to weigh the actual situation and provide a fundamental solution to the financial and economic problems of Sichuan Province. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) After the Executive Headquarters issued the measures for the recovery and destruction of local banknotes, there was very little transaction in the money industry.

<p>(London) Regarding the rumor that British merchants in Shanghai are lending 10 million yuan to the Chinese coal industry, neither political nor business circles in London know anything about it. Those here who are concerned about Chinese affairs say that the Japanese Vice Minister of Finance informed British government economic advisor Sir Leith-Ross that Japan considers assisting China to stabilize the political situation as the most important thing, more important than international loans. Japan's intentions can be seen from this. People here earnestly declare that the various fears raised by Japanese newspapers regarding the mission of Sir Leith-Ross and British railway expert Major General Hammond (who is currently in Japan after investigating Chinese railways for six months) are unfounded and claim that British policy will never make the existing disputes and hostilities in the Far East worse.

<h3>Wang Yongbin Discusses the General Situation of Justice in Various Provinces of North China</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Yongbin spoke to a Central News Agency reporter on the 11th about the general situation of justice in various provinces of North China as follows: Among the courts at all levels in North China that accept lawsuits, the provinces of Hebei and Shandong have the most, with Hebei Province having the most cases. The courts in the two regions of Chahar and Suiyuan have fewer cases. Moreover, litigation is accepted by League and Banner Mongolian officials, so the number of cases accepted by the courts in those provinces cannot be compared with those in Hebei and Shandong. Consequently, there are not many backlog cases. The performance of Shanxi and Henan provinces is relatively good. Among the courts in Luoyang, Kaifeng, Xuzhou, and Zaozhuang, Kaifeng has the most backlog cases, and the case handling performance of the others is only average. Furthermore, in terms of the nature of cases in each province, criminal cases are more numerous than civil cases, and among criminal cases, murder and robbery cases are particularly prevalent in the provinces of North China. This clearly shows that rural areas are bankrupt, people's lives are difficult, and they are resorting to desperate measures. Regarding prisons, generally speaking, prisons are better than detention centers, and new prisons are better than old prisons. Specifically, the performance of Shandong prisons is remarkable, and Hebei Pingbao also has its strengths. Shanxi is relatively simple, and Shaanxi is also crowded. The old prison in Xuzhou was originally only able to accommodate one hundred people, but now it exceeds six hundred. Inmates squat everywhere inside the prison, including in the toilets, next to the steps, and beside the stove. However, more than four hundred of them are prisoners detained by the administrative commissioner's office and are not under the jurisdiction of the court. He has discussed with Commissioner Shao to expedite trials or transfer prisoners to avoid overcrowding. (Central News Agency dispatch, 11th)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Income Tax and Compulsory Education</h3>
<p>Last month, it was reported that the principles of income tax and the scope of taxable and tax-exempt rates have been stipulated by the Tariff Commission and are currently under review by the central government. It is also heard that the collection of income tax will definitely begin on New Year's Day next year. Although the revenue section of the general budget for the 24th year lists only 5 million yuan for income tax, it is estimated that this revenue will actually be 20 million yuan per year. In fact, anyone with a basic understanding of economics can talk about income tax as a good tax. It is perfectly reasonable and just for citizens who are economically capable to fulfill their obligations to the country. Furthermore, the adoption of a progressive system rather than a proportional system is sufficient to curb the extraordinary profits of speculators and monopolists and to bring the rich and poor closer to a less disparate situation. This is truly an effective social policy that should be approved by citizens with a sense of civic duty. Although there is more than one method and path for collection, a careless selection will cause malpractices. National conditions are special and different from other countries. If the assessment is not thorough, loopholes will be seen immediately. However, we certainly do not want to make a point of giving up eating because of choking. We only hope that the authorities will come up with a proper and detailed plan, so that in the future, there will be no malpractices and no loopholes. Taxpayers will all be happy and tell each other, "This is truly a good tax. Every penny that we pay goes to the most appropriate path, making full use of its value, without any waste. This is truly a good tax." Then it will be enough to boast of the efficiency of administration and to comfort the original intention of taxation.</p>
<p>Based on the previous statement, the so-called good tax is said to be very good in its intention and extremely fair in its legislation. But it is still not complete. It must be viewed from its use. It is appropriate to take it and it is also appropriate to use it. Then it can be called a good tax without any regrets. Suppose income tax is levied on one side, but there is no plan for a proper use on the other side, merely to set up redundant agencies and fill useless expenses. Then, it will be doubted by everyone whether it is a good tax. Our country is currently engaged in construction, with a hundred things waiting to be done. We only worry about not having a continuous source of revenue, and we certainly do not worry about not having a proper use. Initially, how will the 20 million yuan in tax revenue be allocated to what kind of urgent and important undertaking, so as to achieve the greatest function? This depends entirely on the keen eyes and clear judgment of the authorities and overall planning. What we want to say now is that the promotion of compulsory education should receive this money as assistance.</p>
<p>The necessity of promoting compulsory education is very clear and does not require further explanation. The Ministry of Education now stipulates that the implementation steps should be in three phases. Starting in August of this year, short-term primary schools will be expanded, gradually progressing until August of the 33rd year of the Republic of China, when four-year compulsory education will be achieved. The reason for not seeking to achieve it all at once is due to insufficient teachers and inadequate facilities, but the main reason is insufficient funds. Even in the current starting period, according to the radio speech by Lei Zhen of the Ministry of Education, the implementation plans reported by various provinces and cities require more than 18 million yuan in expenses. The provinces will raise their own funds, and it is estimated that 9 million yuan can be obtained. The central government will subsidize 2.4 million yuan this year. According to recent news, the Sino-British, Sino-American, and Sino-French Boxer Indemnity Funds have decided to allocate subsidies of 200,000 yuan. After offsetting, there is still a shortfall of more than 6 million yuan. The provinces raising their own 9 million yuan is only an estimate. It is uncertain whether it will be realized. Even if it is realized, it will definitely be a strenuous and difficult task. Moreover, the promotion of compulsory education is gradual. The needs of next year will inevitably be greater than this year. As time passes, it will become more difficult. It is not difficult to imagine that if this shortfall cannot be made up, not only will the completion of the third phase be difficult to achieve as scheduled, but the achievements of the first phase will also be discounted. This is something that deserves great attention.</p>
<p>Upon checking the general budget for the 24th year, the 2.4 million yuan for compulsory education is a specially increased educational expenditure. At a time when everything is being sought to be economical, this item has been specially approved. The central government's emphasis on compulsory education and its determination to implement the plan can be seen in general. However, the shortfall is still more than double that amount. If the income tax revenue is not used for other purposes, it can be used to make up the deficit. If there is 20 million yuan per year, there will be more than enough to make up the shortfall. Even if there is only 5 million yuan as listed in the general budget, the difference is not much. Income tax is taken in the most equitable manner, and the expenditure on compulsory education is the most widespread. Using this to support that, the promotion of compulsory education will have fewer obstacles in terms of funding, and the fact that income tax is a good tax will be more apparent.</p>
<h3>General Assembly of the League of Nations: British Foreign Secretary Clarifies Stance on the Italo-Ethiopian Dispute; Fulfil Treaty Obligations Within Capabilities; Uphold Collective Security System to Guarantee Peace; Our Representative Bitterly Laments Past Failures of the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Geneva) British Foreign Secretary Hoare explained the British attitude towards the Italo-Ethiopian dispute at today's meeting of the League of Nations General Assembly. His main point was that Britain is no less willing than other countries to fulfill the obligations imposed on Britain by the League of Nations Covenant within its capabilities. Hoare began speaking at 11:12 AM. The venue was very crowded. Hoare stated that it would be an unfair and dangerously misleading misunderstanding to say that Britain's motives are not out of loyalty to the League of Nations, but for some base purpose, or that even if Britain has this loyalty, it cannot be relied upon. It must be known that the British government's attitude has always been loyal to the League of Nations, and it remains so today. British public opinion has expressed how the people support the government in fully accepting its obligations as a member of the League of Nations, and taking this as the main purpose of its foreign policy.</p>
<p>Collective Security Has Broad Implications</p>
<p>Collective security is a complex concept that has broader implications than so-called disarmament. It includes not only Article 16 of the Covenant, but also respect for the entire Covenant and various treaty obligations. It is based on the basic obligations recognized by all. What is this obligation? It is to handle disputes by peaceful means as stated in the League of Nations Covenant. If a member state does not comply with the Covenant and resorts to war, there is ultimately an obligation to take collective action to stop the war. Treaty obligations must be undertaken collectively. The security of the majority cannot be guaranteed solely by the efforts of the minority. Action must be taken to eliminate the causes of war and to seek methods other than war to regulate the natural expression of international forces. However, the fairness of demanding change may not coincide with national sentiments, because national sentiments are aroused to support this demand. Moreover, the changes they need often create more injustice than they seek to eliminate. Such changes must be made when the time is ripe, and not when it is not yet ripe, and never by unilateral action or threats of war. If such precedents are to be established in international affairs and recognized by all, members of the League of Nations must pay attention to this and other security measures.</p>
<p>Willing to Jointly Develop World Resources</p>
<p>Hoare acknowledged that Britain's sincerity and thoughts stem from an enlightened self-interest, and cited the possibility of making good use of world resources as proof. He also said that in terms of colonial raw materials, the current situation may cause concerns among countries without colonies that monopolies are about to be established and are detrimental to them. These concerns are indeed exaggerated and contain other effects. However, it would be unwise for us to ignore them. Britain is prepared to participate in the investigation of such events. We firmly believe that all countries can make valuable contributions to mankind, and that both advanced and backward countries, without prejudice to their independence and territorial integrity, can expect advanced countries to help them develop their resources and create their national life. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) At the beginning of his speech at the League of Nations General Assembly, British Foreign Secretary Hoare said, "I do not mean that there has been a more difficult time to speak and discuss in the history of the League of Nations General Assembly than today. At a time when the world is alarmed by the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, a slight lack of caution in speech can make the situation more serious and the work of the League of Nations more difficult. At the beginning of its establishment, some strong countries did not join the League of Nations, and later several countries withdrew. The lack of universality naturally caused an uneasy element and raised questions as to whether the League of Nations' work of maintaining peace can rely on the support of the whole world. Our seats are already mostly vacant, and we do not want to be empty again." (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Economics More Important Than Politics</p>
<p>Hoare then came to the conclusion, saying that economic issues are actually more important than political issues. The British government is now prepared to join with various countries to study world resources and methods for re-distributing the entrusted territories. He also stated that the British government still maintains a faithful attitude towards the League of Nations. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Our Representative Yan Speaks Next: Supports Collective Security System</p>
<p>(Geneva) At this morning's meeting of the League of Nations, after British Representative and Foreign Secretary Hoare delivered his speech, Chinese Representative Dr. Yan Huiqing spoke next, saying, "The core of the League of Nations consists of as many as thirty countries. They all know that whether world peace can be maintained depends on whether the League of Nations can obtain new life. This point is truly gratifying. If the League of Nations fails again in restoring its authority, then its efficiency, on which world peace depends, will not be left intact. In the past, various countries have signed various agreements in Geneva, London, Rome, Stresa, Moscow, etc., which are all sufficient to enhance collective security. The League of Nations has therefore become another name for security guarantees. Any member state, whether strong or weak, that encounters aggression from other member states or non-member states should be protected by the League of Nations." (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>The League of Nations Organization is Universal: Non-European Events Should Not Be Ignored</p>
<p>Yan then criticized politicians for paying too much attention to European events and neglecting non-European events, saying that the general public believes that events that occur far away have a smaller impact on European relations. This view is not accurate, and the resulting drawbacks can cause international conflicts to occur one after another. It must be known that the organization of the League of Nations must have universality. Wherever war has occurred in the world in the past, the League of Nations has intervened, but due to a lack of courage, it has failed to force countries that violate the various principles of the Covenant to comply, thus leading to failure. The Chinese people are peace-loving and still firmly regard the League of Nations as their destination and are willing to cooperate with various countries to promote a collective security system. British Foreign Secretary Hoare said that all countries from east to west should cooperate to promote China's stability and progress. I fully agree with this statement. It should be known that a prosperous and strong China is of great importance to the whole world. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Why So Cowardly Towards Japan and Germany?</p>
<p>(Geneva) Italians here have a painful impression of the speech given by Foreign Secretary Hoare at today's meeting of the League of Nations General Assembly. An Italian official asked a Reuters reporter, "Why is Britain so tough on Italy, an old friend, but so cowardly towards Germany and Japan?" A famous French commentator claimed that he believed that the British Foreign Secretary's speech was one of the most impressive ever heard in Geneva, reminiscent of the era of the late Lord Curzon. Britain has revealed its face from its far-sighted plans and has once again become the indisputable leader in diplomacy. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>British and French Talks Harmonious</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Officials declared that Laval and Hoare held their second talk last night, lasting one hour, and once again expressed the spirit of harmony and friendliness between the two sides. Regarding the matters discussed, well-informed sources said that all the facts of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute were discussed in detail, but no decision has been made. It is widely rumored in France that the British government is determined to invoke Article 16 of the Covenant, but the British delegation believes that negotiations with Italy have not yet ended and does not want to issue any statement regarding this rumor. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is heard that France is quite concerned about the impact of the speech that the British Foreign Secretary will give at the League of Nations General Assembly tomorrow. It is heard that Laval has advised him to moderate his language, fearing that the British Foreign Secretary's frank official words will force Italy to withdraw from the League of Nations. According to French sources, the British Foreign Secretary stated firmly during his meeting with Laval that Britain attaches importance to the collective security system and intends to maintain the League of Nations to prevent failure. This move is a matter of great importance. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The "L'Ère Nouvelle" newspaper speculates on Laval's intentions, saying that Laval has prepared a new proposal. This afternoon, Laval will first meet with Hoare and then with Italian Chief Representative Aloisi, and present this new proposal to Italy. As far as we know, Laval has no hope of a peaceful resolution of the dispute, but he is driven by conscience and must make a final effort to negotiate. He will try to get Britain to recognize the possibility of Italy's military occupation of Abyssinia first, but this is something that the British Cabinet does not want to hear. If Britain can make a final concession on this point, then Laval can make a proposal to Italy based on this concession. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>The Five-Member Special Committee: Mediation Reaches Stalemate; Italian Representative's Attitude Tough; Meeting Set for Next Tuesday</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Five-Member Special Committee has reached a stalemate today due to the tough attitude of Italian Chief Representative Aloisi. The Special Committee met this morning to listen to Chairman Madariaga's report on his conversation with Aloisi. This report was entirely negative, because the Italian representative's attitude was absolutely tough and uncompromising, so Madariaga could not obtain any opinions or encouragement from the Italian representative. Faced with this situation, the Special Committee decided that it would be useless to explore the matter now. After the subcommittee reviewing Italy's memorandum accusing Ethiopia of not being qualified as a member of the League of Nations submits its report, the committee will determine its course of action. The report is expected to be submitted within the next thirty-six hours. If no unexpected events occur, the Special Committee will meet again on Thursday to draft a report to the Executive Council, listing the opinions of the members. It is generally believed that these opinions will be nothing more than the "recommendations" stipulated in Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant. The committee's meetings have never gone beyond the scope of the proposals made at the Paris Three-Power Conference, and have not discussed military and political control proposals. Their discussions have revolved around collective and economic assistance to Ethiopia. It is generally felt that the committee has very little hope of reaching any conciliation methods. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Political figures here are quite pessimistic about the future of the Five-Power Subcommittee dealing with the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. A Havas reporter has learned that some representatives on the subcommittee have serious doubts about whether the committee can continue its work of reconciliation, because subcommittee chairman and Spanish representative Madariaga has held successive talks with Italian representative Aloisi, and always feels that the Italian side lacks a spirit of cooperation. It is said that Aloisi has always maintained a passive attitude and refused to put forward Italy's final demands. Therefore, according to well-informed sources, British Minister Without Portfolio Eden proposed to the subcommittee that the subcommittee should only record that the committee was unable to fulfill its mission due to the Italian attitude lacking a spirit of cooperation. In this case, the subcommittee can resign. On the contrary, French Premier and Foreign Minister Laval insisted that the subcommittee should continue its work of reconciliation and not make a hasty decision, but should wait until all attempts to bring the two sides closer together have been exhausted before making such a decision. The result of the subcommittee's meeting was that Laval's proposal was adopted, and it was decided that the subcommittee would continue to meet next Tuesday. During the same period, the expert committee organized by the subcommittee should organize all the documents submitted by Italy and Ethiopia and prepare a detailed report. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations General Assembly: Adds a Vice-Chairman; Given to Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Presidium of the League of Nations General Assembly met today and resolved to add a Vice-Chairman, and give this seat to Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov. According to this election of Vice-Chairmen, the chief representatives of Britain, France, Italy, Spain, Belgium and Mexico were all elected, and the Soviet Union was the only one missing. Therefore, the Presidium had this adjustment. At the same time, the Presidium has cancelled the resolution to appoint a committee with Litvinov as chairman to review the current situation of the Disarmament Conference. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Presidium of the League of Nations General Assembly met at 6:00 PM today, chaired by Czech Foreign Minister Beneš. It was decided that the League of Nations General Assembly will elect a successor to the late Japanese judge Adachi of the International Permanent Court of Justice on September 14, and elect three non-permanent council members of the Executive Council on September 16 to replace Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Mexico, whose terms have expired. In addition, the Presidium meeting also decided to invite Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov to attend the Presidium meeting as Vice-Chairman of the General Assembly. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Italy's All-Out Fascist Mobilization Against Abyssinia; Expected Two Million Participants; Spiritual Unity Declared to the World</h3>
<p>(Rome) The government gazette announced today that a national Fascist Party general mobilization will be held soon. All Fascist Party members, Fascist trade union members, and Fascist youth league members will all participate once the mobilization order is heard. It is expected that there will be 2 million participants at that time. The purpose of this general mobilization is to respond to the demonstrations of the International Anti-Fascist United Front. It is generally believed that the date when this mobilization order is issued will be the day when Italy declares war on Abyssinia. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The news that Mussolini will soon order a test mobilization of national and colonial troops has caused a great stir here. All newspapers have posted this news with large headlines. The "Giornale d'Italia" said that there are a total of one million people mobilized. This move is the concrete expression of what Mussolini called, "We will go straight to our goal." The "Tribuna" said that this grand exercise has two meanings. On the one hand, it is to show Italy's order and training, indicating that Italy is different from second-rate countries. On the other hand, it is to make it a tool of authority and true international justice. In addition, it will show the world the existence of a spirit and power of unity. This unity will be tested in Africa, and at the same time, it will determine the revival and indisputable value of the Fascist Revolution. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>

<h3>US Secretary of War Predicts: Italian-Abyssinian War Inevitable; US Will Not Be Drawn into the Vortex</h3>
<p>New York. Secretary of War Dern stated today in Salt Lake City that the current state of affairs in Abyssinia is bound to lead to war, but asserted that the United States will not be endangered and will absolutely not be drawn in, as it will use every possible means to avoid the European vortex. He also stated that the American reception of the Empress of Abyssinia's broadcasted speech from Addis Ababa, advocating for peace, was unclear due to atmospheric conditions, and therefore, from the American perspective, the broadcast was a complete failure. The Empress's speech will be issued tonight, translated into English by her daughter, but according to reports from the broadcasting station, the sound is extremely unclear. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>Abyssinian Government Refuses: Italian Request to Send Troops to Protect Embassy</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa, September 11th. The Abyssinian government today replied to the Italian envoy Vinci, stating that the request to dispatch a detachment of Eritrean troops to Addis Ababa to protect the embassy could not be approved. (Reuters) The Italian minister to Addis Ababa protested this morning to the Abyssinian Foreign Ministry because the Abyssinian authorities made many difficulties for Italian people residing in Abyssinia's inland territory and protected by Italy, when the Italian consul wished them to move to Addis Ababa together with the Italian consulate staff. Previously, the Italian envoy had requested the Abyssinian government to approve the dispatch of 180 Italian soldiers to protect the Italian embassy, but so far there has been no approval. It is reported that the King of Abyssinia has permitted Italy to build a railway from Eritrea to Gondar, or to employ many advisors recommended by the League of Nations, including Italians, but the Italian embassy is completely unaware of this. It is also heard today that the King has given his private residence in Harar to the Red Cross, which has already begun operations there. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>British Navy: Strengthens Defense in the Mediterranean; Five Newly Formed Air Force Squadrons: Guarding West London</h3>

<p>London. The naval correspondent for the "Daily Telegraph," Mr. B. Wardell, recently wrote an article outlining the British government's plans to strengthen and modernize the British Navy, which include the following: (1) Building fortified naval bases, with underground oil storage, and stationing several battleships to wait for the enemy's main fleet to appear and then attack. In the North Sea, destroyers and submarines will act as guards. In addition, old and unusable large warships will be moored inside naval bases to avoid damage from enemy forces. (2) Constructing four "Hawkins-class" cruisers of 9,770 tons. (3) Naval officers will have the largest promotions since the war, especially personnel on cruisers and destroyers will see the most increases. The number of naval soldiers must be increased by 5,000. Furthermore, it is stipulated that the funds needed to increase naval purchases of fuel and ammunition will be increased.

<p>Athens. Italian warships suddenly appeared today in Pylos, Ithaca, and Syros, causing great consternation among the Greek authorities. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>Athens. The Greek government has lodged a protest with Italy against Italian warships occupying Greek military ports. The number of Italian warships near Greek military ports has recently increased dramatically. The most recent incident occurred in the port of Syros, where an Italian warship entered without the permission of the Greek government. It is said that twenty British warships will soon arrive at that port as well. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>Rome. Yesterday it was reported that several Italian warships had entered Greek ports without the permission of the Greek government. According to semi-official sources here, these ships were used to transport fresh water and were not warships. At that time, the maritime weather was severe, and they had to seek shelter in Greek ports. Regarding this matter, the Greek government has not filed a protest. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<h3>Disagreement Between British Labour Party and Trade Unions on the Issue of Sanctions Against Italy; Final Decision to be Made at Brighton Conference</h3>
<p>London. The British Labour Party and trade unions cannot agree on the issue of imposing sanctions against Italy, and their steps are quite disordered. It is likely that a final decision can only be made when the Labour Party holds its annual conference in Brighton on September 24th. According to the recent speech by Mr. Citrine, the head of the British Trades Union Congress (TUC), he advocated for the implementation of sanctions against Italy, even if it leads to war. This is far more radical than the views of most Labour MPs. Conversely, Mr. Lansbury, the leader of the Labour parliamentary party, has adopted a completely pacifist stance, believing that sanctions are sufficient to cause war and should not be followed. Even those on the Labour side who advocate for the resolutions of Geneva to be effective view this as excessively weak and difficult to accept. During the recent TUC conference, this kind of dispute arose in haste and there was no time for lengthy discussion. Later, due to the very strong anti-fascist sentiments of several leaders, a resolution was passed by a majority to advise the government to implement the provisions of the League of Nations Covenant by any appropriate means. Since it says "any appropriate means," war is of course included. It can be seen from this that the nature of this TUC resolution is close to being radical. However, on the Labour side, there is a great theoretical difficulty with this issue, because the Labour Party fully adopts an extreme pacifist stance. During the last war, there were "conscientious objectors," and this aspect must also be taken into consideration. In short, on the issue of sanctions, opinions can now be divided into three factions: one opposes compulsory sanctions, one advocates for the adoption of very moderate sanctions, taking care not to cause armed conflict, and the last faction is extreme, not caring even if it causes war. Mr. Citrine, the head of the TUC, belongs to this last faction. As for which faction the majority of the Labour Party tends towards, this will only be known when the Labour Party Congress is held on September 24th. Based on the current situation, it seems that the majority of the Labour Party opposes extreme pacifism and advocates for the use of sanctions, but the methods used will not be as strict as the resolution of the TUC conference.

<h3>Greek Internal Affairs Take a Sharp Turn for the Worse; Restoration Seems Inevitable; President and Interior Minister Resign; Serious Disturbances Brewing Domestically</h3>
<p>Athens. Premier Tsaldaris made a statement today, saying that a constitutional monarchy is indeed the political system that Greece should have, and suggested holding a public referendum to decide on his proposal. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>Athens. Greek President Zaimis resigned today in protest against the restoration movement. The restoration movement has been inevitable since Premier Tsaldaris's declaration yesterday in favor of reinstating the deposed King George. It is generally believed that the President's expression may further widen the cracks in the army, navy, and air force, while officials still intend to maintain unity to avoid events similar to the March revolution this year. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>Athens. It is generally believed that Interior Minister Lavris will submit his resignation. The position of Interior Minister will be temporarily held concurrently by Premier Tsaldaris. According to news reports, if President Zaimis submits his resignation, he will be replaced by Speaker of the House Voultsos. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Athens. The internal affairs of Greece have taken a sharp turn for the worse, with developments as follows: (1) It is heard that the National Assembly will directly restore the monarchy without waiting for a general vote by the Greek people. (2) Pro-monarchists will abandon the vote. (3) Interior Minister Lauris has resigned, so policing has also been suspended in an invisible way. (4) The navy has been recalled to Athens from Salonica, indicating that the government expects disturbances to occur soon. (5) Republican and monarchist members of parliament staged a large-scale brawl in front of the National Assembly building, with the monarchists being temporarily defeated and driven away. (6) Strikers in Patras clashed with police, resulting in several injuries. (7) Major General P. Ginniotis, commander of the 1st Division stationed in the Athens area, was dismissed from his position due to a conflict with Minister of the Army Gonatas. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>Nuremberg Congress Hall: German Social Democratic Party Congress Closes; Hitler's Trusted Aide Hess Delivers Speech: Recounting the Process of Restoring Military Freedom</h3>
<p>Nuremberg. The National Socialist Party's "Freedom Congress" held its first general meeting in the Congress Hall today. The ceremony was quite solemn, with party soldiers lined up as honor guards. The hall was brightly decorated and could accommodate 20,000 people, with not a single empty seat. At eleven o'clock, the Fuhrer Hitler, accompanied by his trusted aide Hess, stepped into the hall, and the string orchestra immediately played the opening music. The troops stood at attention and raised their rifles, and all the people in the hall stood up spontaneously, singing the German national anthem together. During the singing, Fuhrer Hitler slowly walked to the podium, which was hung with swastika flags. After the singing, the crowd cheered "Long live Hitler!" with a deafening roar, followed by a flag parade, led by the blood flag of November 9, 1922. Everyone in the hall stood up and followed Hitler and the ministers in raising their hands in a party salute. Hitler then expressed his welcome to the diplomatic corps. The string orchestra played several more famous pieces. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>Nuremberg. After Hitler's representative Hess solemnly announced the opening of the Congress, a welcoming speech was delivered amidst thunderous cheers. He then recounted that on March 16th, Germany announced the restoration of national conscription, regaining the armaments for self-defense that any free nation should have for its freedom and independence. Today, Germany is on an equal footing with other free countries in terms of rights and status. Today, the state concludes treaties with other countries, not only voluntarily, but also from the standpoint of defending national interests. At the same time, it has voluntarily concluded a naval treaty with the world's largest naval country, obtaining maritime defense security. The National Socialist Party is the military force to protect domestic freedom, while the National Defense Army is the military force to maintain external security. The National Socialist Party and the National Defense Army are the two pillars of the country. The National Defense Army is not a military force for external aggression, and the National Socialist Party does not want foreign believers. After a long period of cheering, Hess returned to the Comintern Congress in England, saying that the victory achieved by the National Socialist movement in leading the victory over communism must not be easily lost. Germany is determined not to let domestic communist elements gain power again. After the elimination of the power of German Jews, communism will also disappear. The humiliation of 1918 has been washed away, and Germany has regained its freedom under Hitler's leadership. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<h3>New Army Fires Salutes: Welcoming Hitler's Arrival</h3>
<p>London. The German army, created in violation of the Treaty of Versailles, fired salutes here today to welcome German Fuhrer Hitler's arrival to attend the opening ceremony of the 3rd Congress of the National Socialist Party. The Mayor of Nuremberg, a close friend of Mr. Hitler, presented Mr. Hitler with a sword, which was modeled after Charlemagne's sword. Mr. Hitler replied to the welcome speech, saying that the gift was a symbol of national power. Mr. Hitler spoke in a very clear voice, and the audience on each street was extremely crowded, no less than 400,000 people. There were 13,000 soldiers lining the streets, 50,000 National Socialist Party youths, 100,000 party members, and 52,000 laborers. The National Socialist Party Congress is scheduled to open tomorrow, and the anti-Semitic newspaper "Der Stürmer" has published a special edition to celebrate the occasion, detailing various incidents of murder and robbery committed by Jews from ancient times to the era of the Soviet Russian secret police. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>Mayor's Sword: A Symbol of National Power</h3>
<p>Nuremberg. Premier Hitler arrived at the city hall at 6:00 PM today, and the sound of salutes and church bells suddenly sounded together to show welcome. Mr. Hitler first inspected the honor guard on the square, which was surrounded by a large crowd, and then stepped into the city hall, accompanied only by Hitler's confidant Hess, local leader Streicher, and the Mayor of Nuremberg. They gradually stepped onto a specially built high platform, chose a high chair and sat down. The mayor represented Nuremberg in giving a welcome speech, saying that last year the city exhibited a thousand-year-old German sword and said that the first Germany had become a thing of the past, and the second Germany had also been tragically destroyed, but the third Germany created by our Fuhrer is powerful, consistent inside and out, and has once again joined the ranks of great powers. At this point, the mayor presented Mr. Hitler with a photo of the ancient sword and said that he would like to offer the ancient sword to the Fuhrer, and that Germany's strength and freedom are all due to the Fuhrer. Mr. Hitler immediately thanked the mayor for the warm welcome from the residents of Nuremberg and described the progress of the National Socialist Party Congress venue and new buildings, saying that the ancient art capital is now rapidly becoming a rising German city. The new venue can accommodate large-scale political groups and military exercises, which makes us particularly happy. This kind of manifestation of German national power always reminds me of the great gathering in the third year of the National Socialist revolution and the establishment of the new German freedom. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>"Victory of Freedom" Is the Slogan of This Congress</h3>
<p>Nuremberg. The National Congress of the National Socialist Party is scheduled to open here tomorrow. Fuhrer Hitler has arrived here this afternoon and has been warmly welcomed by the crowd. This Congress is the third largest congress of the National Socialist Party after it came to power. Each Congress has a special slogan. The slogan of the first Congress in 1933, after Hitler came to power, was "Victory of Faith." The slogan of the second Congress after the purge on June 30 last year was "Victory of Will." The slogan of this year's Congress is "Victory of Freedom," which is intended to express the restoration of Germany's military freedom. The main feature of this year's Congress is a military demonstration. As usual, the work of the National Socialist Party Congress is divided into two parts: one is the public meeting, which is prohibited from debate but has important political significance, and the other is the non-public meeting, which studies the National Socialist Party program and decides on the political activity plan for the next year. However, the current environment of the National Socialist Party is very bad. In terms of political factions, the National Socialist Party has made more and more enemies, such as conservatives, the Stahlhelm, the Catholic Church, and the Jesus Church, all of which have become enemies of the National Socialist Party. In terms of policies, there is a lack of solutions to national economic difficulties and raw material shortages. As for the internal affairs of the National Socialist Party, it is divided into two factions: the radical faction leaders advocate a thorough solution, demanding to maintain the slogans of "overthrowing the bourgeoisie" and "rejecting reactionary forces." Conversely, the moderate faction leaders support the "national rationality" advocated by Economy Minister Schacht. As for Hitler himself, he vacillates between the two tendencies and takes a compromise attitude. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>Huey Long's Death: The Entire United States Mourns Together; The Remains Are Scheduled to Be Buried Next Thursday; Radical Politics Can Serve as a Warning</h3>
<p>New York. The news of Senator Long's death has been heard across the country, and people are mourning. Even those with different political views are saddened by it. Interior Minister Ickes, who has always opposed Long, said today that Long's death is extremely regrettable from all standpoints. He always thought that the United States had long abandoned the means of assassination to solve political problems, but he did not expect that this kind of change would still occur. Former National Recovery Administration Director General Johnson, Postmaster General Farley, and other important people who have always been Long's political enemies have all sent telegrams to express their condolences to the family of the deceased. At the same time, the state of Louisiana is now in a state of political uncertainty. The large structure created by Long during his lifetime is now like a ship without a rudder. Long's comrades are constantly discussing how to find a way to escape this dilemma, but the opposition party now has calls to abolish all authoritarian laws. It is unlikely that Long's faction will find someone who can inherit Long's legacy. The date of Long's funeral is now scheduled for Thursday. According to the news from the Secretary's Office of the Governor of Louisiana, he may be buried in the gap in the state capitol. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Lester, the leader of the anti-Huey Long faction, issued a statement here today, saying that "Huey Long's murder is extremely regrettable, but now that the person who single-handedly created all kinds of laws that enslaved us is gone, state legislators should immediately find ways to abolish these laws. If they cannot, then they should take Huey Long as a warning." (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>Los Angeles. Sinclair, a writer and politician, issued a statement here today, saying that Senator Huey Long's assassination was the result of the struggle against the concentration of wealth in the nation's class struggle. "Historically, protecting the poor and opposing the rich has always been the most dangerous. The simplest way for the rich to not want to share wealth equally with the poor is to murder those who advocate for equal wealth. Now we have abundant wealth, in fact, everyone can be rich, but the gap between the rich and the poor is becoming apparent, so I am deeply afraid that there will be endless killings in the history of class struggle in the United States in the future." (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Senator Huey Long's corpse is not yet cold, and his political enemies are already planning to eliminate his political organization, while his friends are also discussing how to continue this empty seat. Louisiana Governor Allen, formerly a Sunday school teacher at a Baptist church, is weak and has no prejudices, and will probably resign to let the Lieutenant Governor Nance take his place, while Allen may be appointed as a senator to replace Huey Long. Political observers say that Huey Long's dictatorship in Louisiana and its attached wings have no common interests other than loyalty to the leader. However, it is difficult to predict what will happen in the political situation during next year's re-election. Currently, the garrison is still stationed here to guard against the unexpected. The general public believes that Huey Long's death will greatly hit the radical political movement in the United States. The entire political world is waiting for the collapse of Huey Long's dictatorial organization. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>

<h3>Disputes over the Tai Kee Mine in Liujiang. Four Agencies Assist Liujiang in Negotiating the Purchase of Mining Rights with Tai Kee, Which Has Become a Done Deal.</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Since Liujiang issued a declaration regarding the mining dispute between Liujiang and Tai Kee, Japanese officials stationed in North China generally believe that Tai Kee is illegal. The Japanese Consul in Tianjin, Kawakita Shigeru, and the head of the Kwantung Army's Shanhaiguan Affairs Agency, Takeshita Yoshiharu, advocate a more peaceful approach. The reason for this is that Isegi Seiichi, who was also the head of the Shanhaiguan Affairs Agency, acted without the consent of the Japanese military when he was in office, but it is clear that he was wrong. However, since things have progressed this far, there is no way to reverse it, so it has become an obstacle in diplomacy. As for Tai Kee, at the beginning of the dispute, it originally planned to sell Liujiang to Mantetsu (South Manchuria Railway), but Mantetsu later felt that it was unable to handle this project due to its management of various mines in the Northeast. Tai Kee felt that if it continued to occupy the mine, its sales to China would not be strong. If it gave up, it would be unwilling. It intended to cooperate with Liujiang but was rejected by Liujiang. Unable to do so, it had to mine on its own, producing about 100 tons of coal per day, which could only be sold retail in the Qinhuangdao and Shanhaiguan areas. The Unified Tax Inspection Office received a notice from Liujiang stating that the mine had been occupied and that all coal produced after August 24th should not be inspected and released. The office approved Liujiang's request, so Tai Kee's newly mined coal could not be transported for export. Even the 6 million tons of coal stored by Liujiang in the Qindao Wharf warehouse could not be sold as desired. Before the end of the Pingzheng Rectification Committee, it specially telegraphed the Tianjin Municipal Government, the Hebei Provincial Government, and the Linyu Supervisory Commissioner's Office to jointly handle this matter. In addition to ordering Chen Dongsheng, a counselor at the Hebei Provincial Government's office in Tianjin, to be responsible for assisting in the negotiations, the Hebei Provincial Government also ordered the Construction Department to send a special person to Tianjin to coordinate. Lv, a technician from the Construction Department, will arrive in Tianjin next week. At that time, the heads of the four agencies will directly discuss the matter with Kawakita Shigeru, the Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin. Recently, Tai Kee Company asked Yin Rugeng to mediate, proposing to buy all of Liujiang's mining rights and assets for 650,000 yuan, paying 300,000 yuan in cash at once, and the rest will be returned gradually after the coal is mined, transported, and sold. The 6 million tons of coal stored by Liujiang in the Qindao Wharf will be divided according to a ratio of one to one, with Liujiang getting two parts and Tai Kee getting one part. Liujiang does not reject the sale of mining rights in principle, but the mine's capital is 1.4 million yuan, and the value of machinery and construction equipment over the years exceeds twice the capital. If Tai Kee buys it, the price must be negotiated separately, and the payment must be cleared at once to avoid future problems. Tai Kee does not agree to this. The matter has become increasingly difficult, and it is expected that the negotiations by the four agencies will not be effective. On the Liujiang side, Fang Zhiwu is still preparing all legal procedures in Tianjin to initiate litigation. Another representative, Zheng Songhua, is stationed in Qinhuangdao to monitor the transportation and sales of Tai Kee's forced mining, as evidence for the accusation of encroachment. (9th)</p>
<h3>Investigation of Embankment Breaches in the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River: A Total of 33 Breaches in Eight Counties, Stretching 376,900 Meters</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: During this year's Yangtze River flood, the embankments in Hubei Province were breached extensively. The provincial government repeatedly ordered various counties to investigate the breaches in order to repair them. Among them, the number of civilian embankments is too large, and there is no accurate report for the time being. In terms of the main embankments, only the area under the jurisdiction of eight counties from Hanyang to Songzi has a total of twenty-three breaches, a total of thirty-three breaches, stretching 376,900 meters. The provincial government issued an order on the 10th to the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to rush to repair them. The locations of the breaches are listed as follows: (1) The Jiangdi Yudun north bank of the Fengle Dyke in Hanyang was breached due to overflowing for 18,800 meters. (2) The Shanghekou north bank of the Fengle Dyke in Hanyang was breached due to overflowing for 10,200 meters. (3) The Yejiabian north bank of the Hongen Jiangdi Dyke at the junction of Hanyang and Mianyang was said to have been breached by illegal digging for 42,000 meters. (4) The Damulin north bank of the Hongen Jiangdi Dyke in Mianyang was breached by combined collapse and overflowing for 10,200 meters. (5) The Ruanzizhou south bank of the Liuhe Dyke in Jiayu was breached by bandits for 15,500 meters.

The cost will be even more staggering. (September 10th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Provincial Government's Sugar Cane Business Has Established Xinzao, Shitou, and Pingdan Factories, with a Daily Production of Over 200 Tons, and Is Engaged in Improving Sugar Cane Varieties and Ensuring Sufficient Raw Materials.</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Guangdong has a mild climate and fertile land and was originally a sugar cane producing area. In the past, Guangdong's sugar exports reached more than 30 million yuan annually. Later, with the advent of machine-produced foreign sugar, local sugar production methods were not refined, and the cost was higher, making it unable to compete with foreign sugar. As a result, the market was seized by foreign sugar, and the local sugar business declined, greatly affecting the rural economy. In recent years, imports of foreign sugar nationwide have reached more than 600 million yuan annually. In Guangdong alone, it has reached more than 100 million yuan annually, and the huge leakage is alarming. Since the implementation of the three-year administration plan, the Guangdong Provincial Government has been very active in the sugar cane business. Currently, the provincial government operates two factories in Xinzao and Shitou. Xinzao and Shitou are located in Panyu County, facing the Pearl River and with convenient transportation. There are hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland nearby, all suitable for sugar cane cultivation. The provincial government set up two sugar factories there. The Xinzao Sugar Factory was built by Hawaiian merchants and can squeeze 50 tons of sugar per day. The Shitou Sugar Factory was built by the Czechoslovak Skoda Company and can squeeze more than 100 tons of sugar per day. Both factories started squeezing sugar in December of the 23rd year. Currently, the products include grade A white sugar, grade B white sugar, grade 1 raw sugar, grade 2 raw sugar, grade 4 fine sugar, fire-cooked sugar, icing sugar, and cube sugar. The results are quite good and better than Javanese sugar and above. As for the personnel issue, at the beginning of the operation, the two factories hired foreign engineers from the United States, Hawaii, and the Czech Republic to be responsible at the factory. There are also mechanical and chemical engineering students who graduated from foreign countries and chemistry and engineering graduates from domestic universities practicing at the factory. There are also more than a hundred high school graduates learning at the factory. Once the engineering is proficient, there is no need to hire foreigners again. On the worker side, most of them are workers from the Hong Kong Taikoo Sugar Factory who have returned to the province to serve. Therefore, the technical personnel of the two factories are very skilled, but the raw materials still need to be actively improved. The current raw material issues are: (1) There is still a feeling of insufficient raw material supply. (2) The sugar cane variety needs to be improved. Although Guangdong is a sugar cane producing area, the sugar cane fields have been mostly abandoned in recent years due to the decline of the local sugar business. Machine squeezing of sugar has increased the production volume, and the need for sugar cane has also increased greatly. Taking ordinary squeezing sugar with wooden cane as an example, each load of cane can only squeeze ten pounds of sugar, and the two factories in Xinzao and Shitou can produce 150 tons of sugar per day, 16 loads per ton, totaling 2,520 loads. Then the daily need for sugar cane should be 25,200 loads. It is found that ordinary farmland produces 70 to 90 loads of wooden cane per mu. Then, without tens of thousands of acres of farmland growing cane, it is impossible to supply raw materials continuously. The farmland in the delta near the two sugar factories in Xinzao and Shitou usually grows rice. Once they are ordered to change to sugar cane, the farmers are mostly watching. Moreover, when the rural economy collapses, it is difficult to buy cane seeds and fertilizer due to lack of capital. It is even more difficult to reclaim wasteland to grow cane. The authorities had already observed this. At the beginning of the preparation of the sugar factory, they started to lend money to farmers at low interest rates to grow cane, lending 25 yuan to farmers per mu, without needing any collateral. Only a joint guarantee method of ten people is adopted, and the procedures are very simple. In addition to lending money to farmers to grow cane, the price of cane is also preferential, with a price of 9 hao per load of wooden cane. Taking farmland growing wooden cane as an example, the cost of buying cane seeds per mu in the first phase is about 60 yuan. In the second phase, there is no need to buy cane seeds again, and the cost is about 40 yuan. The harvest of cane growing is 70 to 90 loads per mu. At 9 hao per load, it can get between 60 and 80 yuan. Generally, farmers find it profitable and have borrowed money to change to cane growing. In recent years, due to the fact that cheap grain has harmed farmers in rural areas, the opportunity to grow cane has been a little encouraging. This may not be a way to revive the rural economy. However, at present, in addition to the tens of thousands of acres of cane fields near the delta, other farmland has not been changed to sugar cane because the waterways are farther or the transportation is inconvenient, and the transportation cost is higher. However, the authorities are currently planning to promote it to ensure a sufficient supply of raw materials. Simply promoting cane fields is not a fundamental solution, because the delta area is mostly rice fields. If they are all changed to sugar cane, it will inevitably affect food production. Therefore, the authorities are actively developing improved sugar cane varieties. Before the establishment of the Grain Factory, Professor King, a foreigner, was hired to preside over the breeding and improvement of sugar cane varieties. Professor King is the director of the Sugar Cane Department of the University of the Philippines and has rich experience. When he came to Guangdong, he brought 52 kinds of sugar cane varieties. After a year of testing, it was found that 7 or 8 kinds were suitable for the climate and soil in Guangdong Province, especially "Pot 2553" and "Padaea" are the best. Not only has the production of cane increased, with each mu yielding more than 100 to 200 loads of cane, which is double that of wooden cane, but the sugar content of the cane is also higher, with each load of cane being able to squeeze 14 pounds of sugar, which is also one-third more than wooden cane. In this way, not only will farmers increase their harvest, but the factory will not have to worry about raw materials being interrupted, and the higher sugar content will reduce costs. At present, the cost of squeezing sugar with wooden cane is about 12 yuan per load. If this improved variety is used to squeeze sugar, the cost will be about 8 or 9 yuan only. It benefits both farmers and factories. Therefore, the breeding is actively promoted. There are currently 120,000 improved sugar cane plants that have been delivered to farmers for trial planting. In the near future, they can be completely replaced, and the raw material problem can be solved, and the reduced cost will make it easier to compete with imported products.</p>
<p>In Huizhou, there is the Pingdan Sugar Factory, which was established by the First Army Corps Military Reclamation Office. It is said that the purpose of the military reclamation office is fourfold: (1) to increase the government's revenue; (2) to consolidate the foundation of the sugar industry; (3) to accommodate disabled soldiers; (4) to make up for the people's insufficient wasteland reclamation. The scale of the factory is the same as that of the Shitou Sugar Factory, with a daily production of 100 tons. The technical staff is also very skilled. The only difference is that the cane fields are reclaimed from designated wasteland by the military reclamation office, and the old, weak, and disabled soldiers eliminated by the military are used to cultivate and plant cane in the planting field. Light railways are laid inside the field, and the scale is quite large, but there is still a shortage of raw materials. Farmers in the vicinity are persuaded to grow cane, and the sugar factory pays for the purchase. The price is the same as the Shitou method, 9 hao per load. At the moment, there are many products, and the results are also good.</p>
<p>At present, in addition to the above three Guangdong sugar factories that have products, the Jieyang Sugar Factory is being prepared in the Chaoshan area. Peng Guorui from the Construction Department is responsible for the preparation. Its machinery has a daily production of 70 tons. The preparation is about to be completed, and there will be products soon. The next is the sugar factory in Xiacun, Shunde, which is also being prepared. The sugar factory will still be built by Czechoslovak Skoda. Its machinery can produce 100 tons of sugar per day. Construction is underway. The Military Reclamation Office also plans to reclaim wasteland and grow cane in Dan County, Qiongyai, and plans to build a sugar factory there. The provincial government is still actively expanding the sugar cane business, and is currently planning to establish 15 sugar factories and 4 million mu of cane fields in various counties throughout the province. Therefore, the future of Guangdong is just beginning.</p>

<h3>Songjiang: Home of Both Head of Baojia and Village Chief Suffers Robbery</h3>
<p>The home of Chen Fengqi, the head of the 2nd Baojia, 1st household in Pankou Township, Caojing, 8th district of Punan, was suddenly broken into around 11 PM on the 7th by over ten robbers speaking the local dialect. They carried flashlights, broke down the door, and committed a robbery. They used the flashlight to injure the victim's face slightly. The victim did not dare to resist. The robbers stole two sacks with the words "10,000, Yu Fengqi" printed on them, three bamboo baskets, over ten pieces of single-layer clothing, and replaced their worn shoes with new ones before fleeing. They left behind a flashlight and worn shoes. In Hutang Township, same district but close to Pankou Township, at around 12 AM on the same night, the home of He Caigen, the head of the 5th Jia, 9th household of the 3rd Baojia, who is sixty years old, and his son A-Tu, was also robbed by eight robbers carrying box guns. Four entered the house while four stood guard outside. The robbers stole two dou of white rice and two padded blankets before fleeing. The branch offices have already investigated and reported to the Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Anti-smuggling Patrol Boat Seizes Smuggled Salt</h3>
<p>Two anti-smuggling patrol boats, numbers three and four, are stationed at the Shihudang port to inspect passing ships for smuggled salt. On the night of the 9th, they suddenly saw three sailing ships speeding west. The patrol boats fired warning shots to order the ships to stop for inspection. Unexpectedly, the sailing ships also fired back, clearly showing they were bandits. The two sides exchanged fire for about an hour. The sailing ships did not dare to linger and two turned south to escape, while one went north, each fleeing separately. However, the patrol boats firmly pursued. As a result, the sailing ship going north ran aground. The sailors abandoned the ship and fled ashore. Upon inspection, 17 large packages of smuggled salt were found, as well as the body of a bandit killed by gunfire. He was wearing a willow-bark cloth shirt and blue cloth pants, with a flat-top haircut and bare feet. The patrol boat reported to the team headquarters, which in turn reported to the Nanxiang general team headquarters, and also reported to Prosecutor Liu of the Songjiang District Court. Prosecutor Liu went to the countryside on the 11th to examine the body, confirming one gunshot wound in the back of the head and two in the lower abdomen. The coroner's report has been completed, and the township police have been ordered to provide a coffin.</p>
<h3>Jiading: Order Restored in Police Assault Case</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the police going on strike due to the pear skin incident, it is now known that no police were seen on the streets on the morning of the 10th, and no police were stationed at the patrol stations at Zhouqiao and the South Gate. This was because five police officers who were assaulted the previous evening were temporarily unable to serve, resulting in a temporary absence. Outsiders thus spread rumors of a strike. On the 11th, the bureau had already dispatched other police officers to the stations, and order was completely restored. Regarding the assault on the police, the county government's judiciary interrogated the relevant police officers on the afternoon of the 10th and is now ordering detectives to investigate the principals and accomplices in the case.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Convening of Flood Relief Meeting</h3>
<p>The county government convened a flood relief meeting on the 10th. County Magistrate Wu Qiyun presided. Resolutions: (1) The desired total amount is 10,000 yuan, divided into eleven categories: public servants donate 5 jiao each, yielding 500 yuan; (2) The middle class, defined as those owning 1,000 mu of land or buildings worth 100,000 (yuan) or more, donates 10 yuan each, assuming 100 people, yielding 2,000 yuan; (3) Each trade association donates 20 yuan, yielding 1,600 yuan; (4) Law society members donate 1 yuan each, yielding 700 yuan; (5) Chinese and Western doctors donate 2 yuan each, 500 people, yielding 1,000 yuan; (6) Each Beijing opera and movie theater donates 100 yuan, yielding 600 yuan; (7) Each rickshaw owner donates 5 jiao per vehicle, yielding 1,625 yuan; (8) Each house construction project donates 10 yuan, from September 16th to June 16th of the following year, assuming 50 projects, yielding 500 yuan; (9) Each steamship and automobile company donates 20 yuan, assuming 10 companies, yielding 200 yuan; (10) Teachers and staff of middle schools and above donate 5 jiao each, yielding 120 yuan; (11) Middle school students donate (amount unclear, likely 1) jiao each, yielding 1,200 yuan; (2) Fundraising methods: except for public servants managed by the county magistrate and trade associations managed by the chamber of commerce, the middle class and rickshaw owners are managed by the taxpayer association. Beijing opera and movie theaters without trade association organizations will jointly elect three committee members to manage.</p>
<h3>Joint Transportation Between Xihu Road and Railway</h3>
<p>The Xihu Road has been open to traffic for a month. Among the various sections, the passenger traffic on the Suzhou-Changzhou and Xihu Road Changshu-Taicang sections is the highest. Zhu Kaichou, the general manager of the Xihu Long-Distance Bus Company, believes it is necessary to cooperate with the railway for joint transportation. He has contacted Huang Boqiao, the director of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, several times. Once the contract is signed, it can be implemented. At that time, he also plans to set up an office at the Suzhou Railway Station, the center of the joint transportation, to handle ticket inspections, luggage unloading, and other matters.</p>
<h3>Opposing Long-Distance Telephone Price Increase</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Communications revised the regulations for Beijing-Shanghai long-distance telephone lines, the Wu County Chamber of Commerce stated that the fee for a three-minute call between Suzhou and Shanghai was 6 jiao, which was actually double the old regulations. Merchants and residents could not bear the burden. They planned to join forces with chambers of commerce in various places to strongly argue with the Ministry. Now, the Wu County Banking Association also stated that after the new regulations for long-distance telephone lines were revised, users in Suzhou and Shanghai suddenly faced double the burden, which went against the original purpose of developing public utilities. Therefore, they have telegraphed the Ministry of Communications requesting that the original plan be temporarily maintained to protect the business community and benefit transportation.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Autumn Cocoon Market to Open Today</h3>
<p>The autumn silkworms in the four rural areas initially thrived due to suitable climate and adequate rainfall. However, recently, the weather has been fluctuating between cold and hot, with intermittent rain, which has had a significant impact on the development of the silkworms. Symptoms such as dense disease and fluid retention have been observed, and the harvest is expected to be reduced. Currently, the majority of autumn silkworms have entered their cocoons, and the autumn cocoon market is scheduled to officially open on the 12th. A total of 149 cocoon markets have reported opening this year. The standard cocoon price is 20 yuan per dan. In addition, the Central Guidance Station in Anzhen and other places in the 7th district of this county is advocating the rearing of late autumn silkworms because the weather is still hot and there are many remaining mulberry leaves. Farmers in the four rural areas are enthusiastically ordering late silkworms.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Financial and Construction Department Loan Established</h3>
<p>To cope with the Mid-Autumn Festival, the Zhejiang Financial Department requested a loan of 100,000 yuan from the Zhejiang Local Bank, using short-term loan bonds as collateral, with a monthly interest rate of one percent, to embellish the disbursement of government funds. In addition, the Zhejiang Construction Department sent Secretary Wang Guohua to Shanghai to jointly borrow 600,000 yuan in cocoon purchase funds from nine banks in Shanghai, including China, Transportation, Xingye, Shanghai, Shanghai Commercial, Continental, Jincheng, Salt, and Zhongnan. It also borrowed another 100,000 yuan from the Bank of China to meet the needs of paying off overdue public funds for highways. Wang and Jin Runquan, the manager of the Hangzhou branch of the Bank of China, returned to Hangzhou together the night before last. They agreed on the procedures on the afternoon of the 11th and signed the contract on the same day to provide funds to meet the needs.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Sets Standard Cocoon Prices</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Construction Department Silk Monopoly Association held its fifth standing committee meeting yesterday, chaired by Wei Xihong. They approved the establishment of 116 cocoon inspection houses in various counties and decided to continue opening the market starting from the 13th. The standard prices are calculated based on 440 yuan for cocoon cost and 100 yuan for reeling labor: (1) 180 jin of waste silk, fresh cocoon price 26 yuan; (2) 410 jin of waste silk, cocoon price 24 yuan; (3) 410 jin of waste silk, cocoon price 22 yuan; (4) 470 jin of waste silk, cocoon price 20 yuan; (5) 500 jin of waste silk, cocoon price 18 yuan. A central price of 22 yuan per dan is used as the basis for negotiation, with adjustments made according to the quality. The directors of the eight district offices were also decided and announced, including (1) Shen Huaru, (2) Yu Danping, (3) Wu Zhen, (4) Sheng Lianxin, (5) Zhu Xinyu, (6) Xu (name missing), (7) Chu Huiyi, (8) Xu Xingbin. They will immediately go to organize and establish the offices.</p>
<h3>Nantong: New Nantong District Commissioner Xu Takes Office</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Administrative Inspector Commissioner and concurrently Security Commander of the Nantong District, Xu Zhen (Zi Shida, from Liaoning), arrived in Nantong by boat from Shanghai on the 9th. Accompanying him were Secretary Sheng Guishan and Zhang Gongren, the instructor of the 4th District of Jiangsu Province. Commissioner Xu is scheduled to take over on the 11th.</p>
<h3>Ningbo: Fire at Pharmacy Causes Losses of 10,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Qingyizhai Pharmacy, located at No. 264 Gongyuan Road in Ningbo, has been in operation for over a hundred years and has been quite successful in its business. In June of this year, a fire suddenly broke out in a medicine bucket under the ladder on the drying platform. It was discovered and extinguished in time. Afterwards, sporadic fires would occur either upstairs or downstairs, or every few days, totaling eight times. The manager of the store, seeing these strange occurrences, had no choice but to pray to the gods for a solution. Later, things were quiet and nothing happened. Unexpectedly, at around 7 PM on the 9th, a fire suddenly broke out again in the cargo room upstairs in the shop. In an instant, the fire pierced through the roof and was unapproachable. It was spotted by the Gulou observation tower, which immediately rang the bell to alert the fire department. The Jing'an Fire Brigade, located nearby, was the first to arrive to extinguish the fire. Subsequently, the Public Security Bureau fire brigade and various volunteer fire brigades also arrived to assist in the rescue. The fire was finally extinguished after half an hour. Fortunately, the pharmacy was surrounded by high walls, so it did not spread to neighboring houses when the fire was raging. It is reported that the losses from the fire are estimated to be over 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, the Maojia Great Hall in Yizicao in the western suburbs, which consists of three front, middle, and rear sections of flat-roofed houses, houses over 40 households of different surnames. One of them, nicknamed "Fanbai A-San," who works as a porter, has a wife named Wang who suffers from mental illness. At midnight on the 9th, she got up to cook tea and rice because she was hungry. Unexpectedly, a spark landed on a flammable object. At around 1:30 AM on the 10th, a fire suddenly broke out. The observation tower rang the bell to alert the fire department. Various water dragons (fire engines) rushed to the scene, but the winding paths made it difficult to find the way. Fortunately, there was a river nearby, so there was no need to search for water. The fire was extinguished in a short time. Over ten households were affected, including Zhu Guozhen, Hu A-jia, Mao A-zhong, Mao A-mao, Mao Yongshou, and Li A-guan. Over 20 flat-roofed houses were destroyed. The total losses are estimated to be over 10,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>European and Asian Giant Plane Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday: Flew 15,200 Kilometers from Germany, Only 8 Days of Flying Sets New Sino-German Flight Record, Chinese and Foreign Guests Welcomed Enthusiastically</h3>
<p>The Junkers Ju 52 giant aircraft ordered by the European and Asian Aviation Company from Germany, piloted by German aviator Lude and others, took off from Berlin and arrived in China, landing at Longhua Airport at 3:20 PM yesterday. It only took eight days of flying en route, breaking last year's nine-day record for long-distance Sino-German flight by Baron Gobel. Yesterday, hundreds of Chinese and foreign men and women went to welcome the plane, creating a grand scene for a time. A reporter from Xin Xin News Agency filed the following detailed report:</p>
<p>Airport Arrangement</p>
<p>Inside and outside Longhua Airport, police officers from the Public Security Bureau were responsible for security. Chinese and foreign guests were required to present a circular admission pass issued by the company to enter the airport. A temporary shed made of reed mats was erected on the right side of the airport. The Chinese party-state flag, the German National Socialist Party flag, and the European and Asian Aviation Company flag were hung high in front of the shed, arranged separately, fluttering in the wind, creating a magnificent sight. More than a hundred seats were prepared inside the shed for guests to rest, and tea and snacks were provided to entertain the guests. The arrangement was simple and orderly.</p>

<p>Landing Situation</p>
<p>Yesterday at 3:00 PM, Chinese and foreign guests had arrived at the airport one after another and stood waiting for about an hour. At 3:20 PM, the plane was spotted in the eastern clouds. At that time, the company's Shanghai-Ping aircraft on the eastbound route to Shanghai was arriving on schedule, and they met en route and served as guides. In about two minutes, the two aircraft had reached the airspace above the airport. The sound of the engines rumbled, shaking the entire airport. The Shanghai-Ping eastbound aircraft landed first, and the giant plow plane followed suit, landing safely. Huang Jiangquan, chairman of the company's board of directors, and Chinese and foreign guests moved forward in droves, crowding around the plane. Before long, the plane door opened, and the famous aviators Lude and Kesak, and five others, emerged one by one. Everyone was wearing white flight suits. Miss Shi Yongyi presented flowers to each of them, and they took a group photo with Huang Jiangquan and others next to the plane. They then went to the tent, where Huang Jiangquan delivered a welcome speech. (Li Jingcong, general manager of the European and Asian Company, was unable to return to Shanghai due to matters in Rong.) Finally, everyone drank champagne until about 5:00 PM before dispersing.</p>
<p>Flight Record</p>
<p>The medium-sized aircraft took off from Berlin, Germany, on the 3rd of this month. On the same day, it flew to Safi, on the 4th to Bo Gutokta, on the 5th to Yuakank, on the 6th via Glagik to Zhupu, on the 7th to Anandabai Dongcheda, on the 8th to Hamke, on the 9th to Hanoi, and on the 10th at 1:25 PM it arrived in Guangzhou. On the 11th at 9:00 AM it took off from Guangzhou and arrived in Shanghai at 3:20 PM in the afternoon. The aircraft's voyage was 15,300 kilometers and it took a total of nine days of flight. However, it was delayed for one day in Hanoi due to a hurricane. In reality, it only flew for eight days, so this long Sino-German flight broke Baron Gebes' nine-day record from last year.</p>
<p>Aircraft Features</p>
<p>The aircraft is silver-gray, with the German flag and the National Socialist Party flag painted on the tail, with the letters "Daban" in the middle and the letters "Jutbansa" in small print at the front. It is equipped with three engines with 1,980 horsepower, a top speed of 290 kilometers per hour, a working speed of 260 kilometers per hour, and a payload of 13,255 pounds. The special feature is that the aileron is complete, so it descends quickly and at a large angle. It has a maximum of 24 seats. With a load of 200 pounds, the descent rate is 98 kilometers. The flight altitude is a maximum of 21,325 feet, and the normal flight altitude is 8,900 feet. The length of the aircraft is 62 feet, the height is 18 feet, and the width is 96 feet, so it appears quite large when it lands on the ground.</p>
<p>Six People on Board</p>
<p>When the aircraft departed from Germany, the personnel on board were the chief pilot Lude, the co-pilot Kesak, the mechanics Nawenzos and Ewlek, and four others. When they arrived in Guangzhou, He En, the head of the airline group who went to welcome them from the European and Asian Company, and Deng Gaozhang, the station master of the Guangzhou station, boarded the plane and came to Shanghai, for a total of six people.</p>

<p>Huang's Speech</p>
<p>Huang Jiangquan, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the European and Asian Aviation Company, delivered a welcome speech in German yesterday, saying: I am honored to welcome you in my capacity as chairman. The new German nation's aviation is quite developed. This flight of the 52 is proof of this. Although this is not the first time a German aircraft has flown to China for a long-distance flight, the enthusiasm of the welcome is even more enthusiastic than before. This is a sign of close cooperation between the two major nations of Germany and China. It is expected that the addition of the 52 to the company's fleet will achieve even better results and help Chinese aviation transportation a lot. It will also greatly improve China's economic life, and indirectly benefit the world economy. The cooperation between Hansa Company and the European and Asian Aviation Company will further increase the feelings between China and Germany. I offer this champagne to wish you good health, and so on.</p>
<p>Soon to Fly to Chengdu</p>
<p>The European and Asian Company is now planning to assign the giant aircraft to the new route from Xinjiang to Chengdu, so the aircraft will make some arrangements in Shanghai before flying to Xi'an in Shaanxi and then to Chengdu, where it will be based for the route. If time permits, before the aircraft leaves, it will arrange to invite people from all walks of life to take a test flight and tour the city for a week.</p>
<p>Two More Aircraft to Arrive</p>
<p>The European and Asian Aviation Company has ordered three aircraft from Germany. Two are Junkers Ju 52 giant aircraft, and the other is a Junkers Ju 160 aircraft. In addition to one Ju 52 aircraft that flew to Shanghai yesterday, there is one more scheduled to fly directly from Germany to Shanghai this month. The Junkers Ju 160 aircraft was shipped from Germany to China in mid-month. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai at the end of this month, and it has been decided to assign it to various routes.</p>
<h3>Minister Kong Comes to Shanghai</h3>
<p>He took the overnight express train from Beijing last night and arrived in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>Minister Kong's Birthday Has Passed: No Birthday Gifts Received, Various Rumors Are Inaccurate. If You Wish to Help Relief Efforts, There Is No Need To Use The Name Of Birthday Gifts</h3>
<p>Because the reporter saw in yesterday's (10th) newspapers that today (11th) was Kong Xiangxi's birthday, and that the Ministry of Finance staff and affiliated institutions would send birthday gifts amounting to 100,000 yuan, which would be transferred to disaster relief, the reporter specially visited a senior official of the Ministry of Finance to inquire about the truth. According to him, Minister Kong's birthday was on the seventh day of the eighth month of the old calendar, which has already passed. At that time, Minister Kong was on his way to Xuzhou and Jining to inspect the disaster, and there was no action of any kind, let alone the receipt of birthday gifts. The outside rumors are because at the time of his birthday, someone suggested sending birthday gifts to be transferred to disaster relief. Later, because the central government already had a resolution on public servants deducting salaries to help disaster relief, the matter was dropped. The information reported in the newspapers is actually a rumor. Furthermore, it was heard that Minister Kong, upon reading the newspaper reports, was quite alarmed and expressed that it is the freedom of the officials under his command to care about the flood and intend to donate to help the disaster relief and benefit the disaster victims. As the chairman of the Charity Relief Association, he also expressed his welcome to this act, but it is not necessary to use the name of sending birthday gifts.</p>
<h3>Water Disaster Relief Association: Discussion Meeting to Be Held the Day After Tomorrow to Discuss Fundraising Methods</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fundraising Association for Flood Relief in Various Provinces has completed all procedures for borrowing relief funds from the banking sector. With the disaster areas in five provinces urgently needing assistance, the investigators appointed by the association for various provinces will depart within days. Mr. Xu Shiying, Vice President of the association, recently went to Beijing to discuss investigation and relief matters with President Wang and Presidents Kong and Ye. He returned to Shanghai the night before last and went to various parties yesterday to discuss the progress of association affairs. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Xu Shiying Returned to Shanghai the Night Before Last</p>
<p>Xu Shiying, Vice President of the Relief Association, went to Beijing the other day on official business to negotiate with the authorities on relief matters. He also contacted President Kong and Vice President Ye to discuss fundraising and investigation methods. He completed his official duties and returned to Shanghai the night before last. Yesterday, Mr. Xu visited the persons in charge of various groups of the association to report on the situation in Beijing and inquired about the progress of the association's affairs in Shanghai. Letters and telegrams from various provinces requesting prompt investigation and relief and official documents reporting on the disaster situation have accumulated to a considerable height, so he has been extremely busy all day.</p>
<p>Investigation Directors to Depart Within Days</p>
<p>The investigation directors for the various provinces were previously appointed by the Joint Meeting of Standing Directors and Supervisors. Except for He Hengfu in Hubei and Yang Zigong in Hebei, who are already in their designated provinces and have begun preparations to start work, the investigation directors for the other provinces will depart within days. The Relief Association has already notified the chairmen of the governments of the respective provinces. After the bank transfers are settled, the investigation directors can depart and handle the investigation and relief matters.</p>
<p>Relief Funds Can Be Transferred Immediately</p>
<p>Regarding the future investigation methods, the banks will first lend relief funds, which will be deposited separately in the Central Bank. The Central Bank will then transfer the allocated amount to the branches in the respective provinces. The provincial disaster relief headquarters and the investigation directors sent by the Relief Association will withdraw the funds from the Central Bank branches. The funds borrowed and advanced by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications have all been deposited into the Central Bank. The funds borrowed and advanced by the member banks of the Bankers Association will also be transferred to the Central Bank within days. Therefore, once all the banks have made their payments, the funds can be transferred to the branches in the respective provinces for withdrawal at any time.</p>
<p>Discussion Meeting to Be Held the Day After Tomorrow</p>
<p>The fundraising group of the Relief Association, in order to enable various groups and organizations to assist in the fundraising work, has scheduled a discussion meeting to be held at 3:00 PM on the 14th of this month in the auditorium of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. In addition to reporting on the disaster situation in various provinces and the progress of association affairs, there will also be a thorough discussion of fundraising methods. The original letter sent to various organizations is as follows: Esteemed Sir/Madam, this year's flood disaster is extremely severe, surpassing even that of the 20th year of the Republic [1931]. The disaster situation is almost beyond description. The disaster reports and photos from the disaster areas are shocking. We believe that you share the same feelings. Compassion exists in everyone's heart. How to provide relief to the tens of millions of compatriots who are mired in deep water and are waiting for help is an urgent matter. Due to the economic recession in recent years and the stagnation of all industries, fundraising in various places is more difficult than it was four years ago. However, even though society is poor and the country is in greater danger, we should demonstrate the spirit of mutual help and self-help among our countrymen. Moreover, today's Shanghai society, with its extravagant consumption, still has the ability to economize and has spare capacity. If we, who live safely by the sea, with clothes to wear and food to eat, do not have compassion for our compatriots in Hubei, Shandong, and other places who are suffering in the floods and after the floods, and do not provide relief, who else will have compassion and provide relief? We, after considering our limited resources, are unable to bear this huge burden. Based on the resolution of the second board meeting of the association, we have decided to convene the leaders of public organizations and all industries in this city to discuss fundraising methods, hoping to achieve positive results through extensive mobilization. We have scheduled a meeting at 4:00 PM on the 14th of the month in the auditorium on the ninth floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA (no refreshments will be provided) to discuss everything. Please be sure to attend on time and help us with this undertaking. We eagerly await your presence.</p>
<p>Citywide General Donation Plan Established</p>
<p>The Water Disaster Relief Association believes that the disaster situation in various provinces this year is extremely severe, surpassing even that of the 20th year of the Republic [1931]. The disaster victims are crying out for relief. In addition to appealing to all parties to generously donate to provide assistance, the association also convened the second joint meeting of directors and supervisors on the 4th of this month to discuss citywide general donation methods. The plan is based on salary calculations: (1) Those earning over 400 yuan will donate one-half; (2) Those earning 301-400 yuan will donate one-third; (3) Those earning 200 yuan will donate one-quarter; (4) Those earning 100 yuan will donate one-fifth; (5) Those earning 90 yuan will donate one-sixth; (6) Those earning 30 yuan will donate from two to four jiao.</p>
<p>General Affairs Group Members Reassigned</p>
<p>In other news, the entire staff of the General Affairs Group of the association has been reassigned. Yesterday, Deputy Director Li Dachao convened a group meeting to discuss various important cases regarding the group's overall direction.</p>

<h3>Lin Kanghou Discusses the Banking Sector's Smooth Passage Through the Mid-Autumn Festival</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter met with Mr. Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Bankers Association, at the Hong Kong Road Bankers Club yesterday to inquire about the state of the banking industry in Shanghai before the Mid-Autumn Festival. According to Mr. Lin, the banking industry in Shanghai has passed the Mid-Autumn Festival smoothly. Since the Dragon Boat Festival, the banks have been very cautious in their lending. However, businessmen inevitably feel constrained. As for the creditors of the Shanghai branch of the Guangdong Bank, their request for separate liquidation is legally untenable. All I can say is that the Shanghai branch of the bank is indeed insolvent. In the future, the liquidation will likely follow the same method as the head office. In addition, a foreign cable was received yesterday afternoon regarding the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia, which is on the verge of erupting. The reporter further inquired about the impact on China's financial market. According to the reply, if Italy and Abyssinia fight a separate war, the impact will be minimal. However, if the war expands, the financial sector will inevitably be affected.</p>
<h3>Our Newspaper Received Flood Relief Donations Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 11th), our newspaper received the following donations for flood relief in various provinces: Mr. Qian Guoyong, 20 yuan; the colleagues of the Dazhong Coal Mine Company, 20 yuan from the Mid-Autumn Festival banquet; Mr. Rong Wenxin, 10 yuan; Mr. Wang Binhou, 5 yuan; Mr. Zhang Rian, Mr. Zhang Yongsai, Mr. Feng Guangyu, Ms. Yang, and Ms. Ye, 5 yuan in total; Mr. Deng Zhifu, 3 yuan; Mr. Zhu Juxiang, Mr. Li Bolong, and Mr. Jin Jieshen, 3 yuan in total; Mr. Qin Meiying, 3 yuan; Mr. Wen Lu and Ms. Dai Xiufang, 2 yuan each; Mr. Yang Youwu and Mr. Zhang Xiling, 2 yuan in total; Mr. Shui Miao and an anonymous donor, 2 yuan each; Mr. Gu Ziting and Mr. Yu Jiarou, 2 yuan in total; Mr. Chen Tianzhen, 1.3 yuan; Mr. Wang Youhao, 1 yuan; Mr. Wei Yulin, 0.5 yuan. The total amount received was 83.8 yuan. The original letter from the Dazhong Coal Mine Company colleagues is attached below: Esteemed Sir/Madam, our colleagues are saddened by the severity of the flood disaster in the country. Not considering our efforts as insignificant, we respectfully transfer the Mid-Autumn Festival dinner expenses of 20 yuan to assist with disaster relief. We hereby enclose the donation for your review and collection. We hope that you will forward it to the disaster area to provide a small measure of assistance. We respectfully pray. Addressed to the Shen Bao Newspaper, from the colleagues of the Dazhong Coal Mine Company Preparatory Office, September 11th.</p>
<h3>Chinese Members of the Central Boundary Survey Committee to Postpone Departure for Boundary Survey</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Liang Yugao and Yin Mingde, the Chinese members of the Sino-British Joint Survey Commission for the southern section of the Yunnan-Burma border, along with their staff, were originally scheduled to leave Beijing for Shanghai on the 10th and take the Clipper ship to Hong Kong on the 14th, and then proceed to the Yunnan border to conduct the boundary survey with the British members. It is now learned that Mr. Liang and Mr. Yin have not yet completed their preparations in Beijing. Moreover, Colonel Islam, the neutral member of the commission, has telegraphed our side, stating that he is busy with League of Nations affairs and will postpone his departure for a few days. Therefore, Mr. Liang and others have temporarily rescheduled their departure from Beijing for Shanghai on the 15th to await departure. It is expected that they will gather in the Yunnan-Burma border area with the neutral member and the British members in late November to conduct the survey.</p>

<h3>Prominent Overseas Chinese Businessman Pan Zhiwo Visited Various Factories in Shanghai, After Which He Will Go to Japan Before Returning to Shanghai and Beijing</h3>
<p>Mr. Pan Zhiwo, a prominent overseas Chinese businessman residing in the Nanyang region, visited Mr. Xie Zhongfu, a member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission in Shanghai, and visited various industrial factories in Shanghai after arriving in Shanghai from overseas the other day. Mr. Pan's return to China this time is to inspect the domestic situation in order to prepare for future investments in China. He originally planned to go to Beijing to pay respects to Minister Chen Gongbo and Chen Shuren, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. However, Mr. Pan urgently needs to go to Japan first to inspect his business operations there. Therefore, he has decided to take a ship to Japan on the 17th and stay for about ten days before returning to China and Beijing.</p>
<h3>Li Liejun Scheduled to Go to Wuxi for Recuperation, Will Stay Until Mid-October Before Returning to Beijing to Attend the Plenary Session</h3>

However, as the Sixth Plenary Session has been postponed to November 1st, he has decided to go to Wuxi with his secretary, Mr. Zhang Migong, on the 13th. He will stay at Yuantouzhu for recuperation. According to Mr. Zhang Migong, the duration of Mr. Li's stay has not yet been determined. If the living environment is good, he will stay until mid-October before returning to Beijing to attend the Sixth Plenary Session.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Telegram Does Not Allow Abolition of Bran Tax; Grain Industry Held a Meeting Yesterday and Resolved to Continue to Strive for Abolition</h3>
<p>After the Oil Cake and Grain Industry Association received a telegram from the Guangdong Financial Commissioner's Office stating that the abolition of the bran surcharge was not allowed, a meeting was held yesterday to appoint representatives to go to Guangdong to petition for the abolition based on reason. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong Financial Commissioner's Office Telegram Replied That Abolition Is Not Allowed</p>
<p>The Grain Industry Association and other organizations received a telegram from the Guangdong Financial Commissioner's Office yesterday stating: "We have received your telegram regarding the concerns of the Shanghai Grain and Oil Cake Association, the Hankou Grain and Oil Cake Association, the Wuxi Wujin Kunshan Oil Factory Association, and the Shanghai Sugar Industry Association. The bran fertilizer surcharge for the construction of Zhongshan University was implemented by order of the Southwest Political Affairs Committee. The previous surcharge of 8 jiao per 100 jin has been reduced to 2.5 jiao, which is an extremely light burden. The merchants and people of this province have already complied with the surcharge. As the matter concerns the cost of constructing Zhongshan University, the request for abolition should not be discussed." Guangdong Financial Commissioner's Office, September 4th, 24th year of the Republic of China [1935].</p>
<p>Suspension of Raw Materials Affects Rural Areas</p>
<p>Since the oil factories in Shanghai, Hankou, Wuhuai, Shan Kunshan, Wuxi, and other places implemented a work stoppage on September 1st to protest the Guangdong bran surcharge, the raw materials for making cakes, such as soybeans, peanuts, and other grains, have been greatly affected. The production areas along the Longhai, Pinghan, Jinpu, and Jinghu railways are particularly affected. The amount of these raw materials transported to the above-mentioned oil cake factories each year is considerable. Now that the factories have stopped work, these raw materials cannot be sold. Moreover, the factories have already telegraphed the production areas to suspend purchases, so the inventory in the production areas is piling up, prices are plummeting, and no one is interested. The livelihoods of farmers are greatly affected, and the freight revenue of the Longhai and other railways is indirectly reduced. In addition, more than 10,000 oil workers have lost their jobs, and their livelihoods are precarious. If they are not given relief, it will have an impact on social stability.</p>
<p>Joint Meeting Appointed Representatives</p>
<p>The executive and supervisory committee members of the Grain and Oil Cake Association and representatives of manufacturers and transporters held a joint meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday. Those who attended included Zhu Jingan, Zheng Zenan, Cai Yukun, Zhu Zixiang, Yan Xiaoxiang, Yu Bingwen, Zhang Xiande, Cao Xingeng, Jiang Hongbin, Ye Tingfan, Chuan Changyu, Xia Xingcun, Luo Rongzhou, Tang Wenxiong, Wu Yongkang, Chen Yunqing, Wu Zisheng, Lu Shaoming, Chen Ziyi, He Yaosheng, Chen Yuming, Gu Xinyi, Xie Boqin, Yang Heqing, and others. Gu Xinyi chaired the meeting, and Kong Rulin served as the recorder. First, the chairman reported on the petitioning trip to Beijing. Then, Zheng Zenan reported that Chairman Xiong of the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce had agreed to provide assistance when the petitioning representatives arrived in Guangdong. Discussions then began on (1) future steps to be taken. It was resolved that, in addition to the previous petitioning representatives to Beijing being appointed as petitioning representatives to Guangdong, a letter should be sent to the Chaozhou Sugar and Sundries Association to request that the Shan Gang appoint representatives to go to Guangdong to jointly petition. Also, if representative Chen Ziyi is unable to go to Guangdong due to illness, it was resolved that Zhu Yunchang should replace him. (2) The issue of the manufacturers' work stoppage was discussed. It was resolved that, as there is no outlet for bean materials, the grain industry will face destruction if the goal of abolition cannot be achieved this time. The only option is to stop work. The meeting adjourned at around 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Hardware Industry Forms a Delegation to Japan, Scheduled to Depart on the 14th</h3>
<p>According to the New Voice Press, Mitsui &amp; Co., Ltd. of Japan has recently organized a sightseeing delegation to Japan in order to promote sales and seek to connect with Chinese businessmen. The delegation is inviting Chinese businessmen who have regular business dealings to visit Japan. The iron industry has already been organized and will depart on the Nagasaki Maru on the 14th of this month. The travel expenses will be provided by the Japanese company. The Iron Industry Association held a meeting to discuss the matter and appointed eight people, including Zhuang Juntang of Yichang, Zheng Shiming of Kechi, Cai Zu'an of Puyi, and Ding Jinhua of Yuanchun. After landing in Nagasaki, they will go directly to the Yawata Iron Works to visit. They will also travel to Osaka and Tokyo for a week before returning to China by ship from Yokohama. It is said that the association will also allocate a subsidy of 2,000 yuan to support the trip.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Registers War Zone Disaster Relief Recipients</h3>
<p>The second batch of relief funds will be issued directly. After the first batch of 20,000 yuan of fire insurance relief funds for the Zhabei war zone was distributed, the Social Affairs Bureau did not issue the second batch because all the accounts had not yet been cleared. The Fire Insurance Compensation Promotion Association of the disaster area requested the Chairman of the Military Commission to instruct the early release of the funds, and the approval was given to request the city government directly. The Social Affairs Bureau, considering the hardship of the disaster victims, intends to distribute the funds itself. Yesterday's announcement of disaster victim registration stated: "It is hereby announced that this bureau has been ordered to handle the case of disaster relief for war zone victims insured by the former Shanghai War Zone Fire Insurance Compensation Promotion Association. The Shanghai Insurance Industry Association and the foreign fire insurance associations have donated 20,000 yuan each, totaling 40,000 yuan. On February 1st of this year, 20,000 yuan was allocated in advance and handed over to the Promotion Association for distribution in accordance with the list of insured disaster victims, with each household receiving 6 yuan in relief funds. The submitted account books and receipts are currently being audited in detail. The remaining funds should have been released after the 20,000 yuan received by the former Promotion Association had been verified. However, in order to show compassion for the disaster victims who have not yet received funds, this bureau will directly issue the remaining funds first. We are first conducting communication registration and will then assign personnel to distribute the funds at a suitable address in the north and south of the city. The communication registration methods are listed below. All registered disaster victims who have not yet received funds must comply. Do not delay. This announcement. (1) Date: From September 11th to September 30th of this year. Late applications will not be accepted. (2) Mailing address: Second Section, Social Affairs Bureau, City Center District. (3) Registration content: (1) Name of household (the name registered with the Promotion Association); (2) Address where the disaster occurred; (3) Current address; (4) Whether or not there is an insurance policy and a receipt for advance payment.</p>

<h3>Municipal Rent Reduction Committee Sends Letters to Various Courts to Suspend Provisional Seizures to Seek Social Stability and Market Recovery</h3>
<p>According to Dagong News, the Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee sent letters to the First Special District, Second Special District, Jiangsu, and Shanghai District Courts stating: "It is respectfully submitted that Shanghai has suffered greatly since the January 28th Incident. Moreover, it has been hit by floods and droughts in recent years, destroying villages and leading to the bankruptcy of the countryside and the decline of the social economy. In this environment, it has become a collapsing image. Factories and stores have closed one after another, and unemployed workers are wandering and impoverished. Although there are those who are struggling to maintain their businesses, many are outwardly strong but inwardly weak. Therefore, rent arrears lawsuits have arisen one after another. The real estate that used to be speculatively priced is now without takers. Compared with the price index, the decline in real estate value is undeniable. Therefore, those who want to barely maintain the status quo are calling for rent reductions, which are appropriate in terms of human feelings and law. However, people are generally self-serving, and landlords who do not understand the situation are unwilling to voluntarily reduce rents. As a result, tenants are forced to default on rent payments, resulting in dozens of rent lawsuits every day. The officials in the courts enforce the law strictly and seize the tenants' property to preserve the landlords' rights. Reducing rent in this environment is generally recognized as necessary. If provisional seizures are imposed in every rent dispute, then most of the industries and commerce in Shanghai will be at risk of provisional seizure. This committee has witnessed this situation, which is related to the stability of the entire society. Therefore, it is requested that your court pay special attention to requests for provisional seizure in rent disputes and suspend them to seek market recovery and thereby stabilize society."</p>
<h3>Distressed Overseas Chinese from Belgium Returned to Their Hometowns Last Night on the Hai'an Ship. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau Issued Relief Funds of Three Yuan Per Person by Name. Except for One Representative Who Stayed in Shanghai, All Others Returned to Their Villages.</h3>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, the distressed overseas Chinese from Belgium were in financial difficulty and had difficulty making a living. They elected a representative to go to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau to appeal for relief. The bureau, seeing the plight of the overseas Chinese, took pity on them and telegraphed the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to request instructions. An instruction was received yesterday approving a reasonable amount of relief. The bureau immediately sent Hou Can and others to the Oriental Hotel to issue temporary relief funds of three yuan to each person. Two yuan of the relief funds were handed over to the Public Security Bureau to pay for room and board and to purchase tickets. After receiving the funds, the overseas Chinese, except for representative Lin Dipu, who remained in Shanghai to negotiate everything, were escorted to the China Merchants Wharf by personnel from the Public Security Bureau last night to take the Hai'an ship back to their hometowns to make a living.</p>

<h3>Construction Deadline Set for Released Land in the City Center</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai Municipal Government has released land in the city center area three times. The first release was as far back as June of the 20th year of the Republic [1931], which is four years ago. Currently, although all the land has been completely released, the construction of houses has not been very active. Therefore, at the 267th municipal meeting in September of last year, regulations were made regarding the deadline for construction on the released land. Land recipients who hold land use permits in the city center area but have not constructed houses in accordance with the land release regulations by the end of September of the 24th year of the Republic [1935] will be charged a monthly abandonment fee of one percent of the land price starting from October 1st of this year, in accordance with Article 6 of the land release regulations. It is now heard that the Land and Public Works Bureaus are actively preparing to implement all the above-mentioned measures as scheduled. According to the regulations in the Land Requisition Method, the construction area in the commercial area must not be less than two-tenths of the total area of the land, and the construction area in the residential area must not be less than one-tenth of the total area of the land.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Board Meeting of the Sino-Foreign Relief Association</h3>
<p>The Sino-Foreign Relief Association on Renji Road, concerned about the Yellow River flooding in the south and the extreme danger in northern Jiangsu, had previously dispatched Father Jacquinot, the president of the Western Section, to personally inspect the disaster situation in Xuzhou. Upon his return to Shanghai, he convened an emergency meeting of Chinese and foreign directors, scheduled for 5:00 PM yesterday. Attendees included Song Hanzhang, Gu Jisheng, Father Jacquinot, Wang Yiting, Lu Bohong, Zhu Yinjiang, Huang Hanzhi, Yan Chengde, Qin Runqing, Zhang Xianqing, Chen Liangyu, and others. President Jacquinot reported on his trip: (1) The disaster area around Weishan Lake requires relief for at least 150,000 people. The cause of the disaster in northern Jiangsu is that the Yellow River has no way to discharge, Shandong is willing to let it out, but Jiangsu is blocking it. A way to discharge into the sea should be found immediately, otherwise, the southward flow of the river will further endanger northern Jiangsu. Floating corpses are a common sight. The flood victims are holding onto their rooftops, unwilling to escape. They are in urgent need of warm clothing. This situation is likely to last for five or six months, which will lead to the failure to plant crops. The aftermath is unimaginable. (2) Funds should be allocated quickly for emergency relief. (3) In the disaster area, epidemics are rampant. Quinine (a Western medicine) must be transported quickly to save lives. (4) Houses have been washed away, crops have been flooded, and future storms will cause even more damage. (5) The Yellow River has now shifted east to the tributaries of the Dahe River. All the old Yellow River embankments are high-lying, so it may not flow south. Everyone was deeply moved upon hearing this. After discussion, it was decided to allocate 20,000 yuan to northern Jiangsu and appoint Father Jacquinot to oversee the relief efforts. Lu Bohong was appointed to be in charge of the Shandong disaster area, with a provisional relief fund of 50,000 yuan. 30,000 yuan was provisionally allocated for the Yangtze River disaster area. It was also heard that 10,000 yuan would be allocated to the Guangdong disaster area. Whether the relief funds need to be increased or decreased will be determined after the relief personnel have investigated the situation.</p>
<h3>Report on the Tragic Disaster in Tongcheng, Anhui</h3>
<p>The China Jishang Association recently received a letter from Lei Mingqi and others, representatives of the disaster victims in the 85 Bao of Laoshan Township, Tongcheng County, Anhui Province. The letter stated that Yonggu Weizi in Tongyi is located on the banks of Sunjia River in Caizi Lake, with inner and outer dikes totaling 400 mu and a population of over 700 people, all of whom depend on the dike fields for a living. A flood occurred twenty years ago, and a drought occurred last year. This summer, the wheat harvest failed. People were looking forward to the autumn harvest, but unexpectedly, summer rains continued for days, and the river tides poured inward, rising day by day. The Bao chiefs, dike directors, and others led the dike residents day and night to protect and reinforce the dike. After years of unprecedented disasters, the people had nothing to live on, with no surplus funds to purchase building materials. They used floorboards, door panels, and pillar posts to block the dangers, vowing to coexist with the dike. Unexpectedly, the north wind howled, and the tides were like mountains. Over 380 zhang of the inner dike collapsed. The southern dike also breached. The newly ripened rice fields were submerged. The disaster victims, who were already eating duckweed and chaff, desperately tried to save the dike. Now that the dike is gone, how will the people live? The dike resident Wu Da Han died while saving the dike. The Bao chiefs, dike directors, and others are at a loss as to what to do for Yang Genfa, Lei Yangshi, Jiang Zhangshi, who are starving to death, and hundreds of other disaster victims who cannot survive without relief. They have no choice but to jointly request the association to send someone to investigate and provide relief. It is hoped that all charitable circles will jointly provide assistance to save the remaining lives and prevent them from ending up in ditches.</p>

<h3>The National Goods Cigarette Exhibition Opens Today. All Cigarette Factories in the City Participate. It Will Be Held at the Great World from Today to the 21st. Public Chess Tournament Starts Today, Nanyang Cigarette Company Donates Cigarettes</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the China National Goods Cigarette Maintenance Association on the Eighth Day of the Eighth Month for National Goods Cigarettes, the atmosphere of the cigarette factories in each industry has been completely renewed. Recently, to further expand its publicity, an exhibition will be held at the Great World from today to the 20th, so that those who love to smoke national goods cigarettes can truly recognize the brands of national goods cigarettes. First, the standing committee members Yuan Lvdeng, Shen Weiting, Shen Xingde, Lao Jingxiu, Ding Yuanqing, Jing Yimeng, Bao Gengsheng, Wu Linzhi, Sun Daosheng, Ding Zhenbo, Shen Xuewen, etc., formulated the outline, and invited Lang Tingsheng, Xi Yushu, Zhang Shankun, Ren Jinping, Lu Shoulun, etc. as consultants to participate in the meeting. In addition, with the support of chess experts Bao Zibo, Chen Shuchun, Ye Huishi, Yang Rujun, Xie Bingyi, Huang Yinchu, Tao Qingquan, Zhao Shiying, Guan Ganzhong, etc., it will be able to open on the Mid-Autumn Festival today. The details of the exhibition are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Origin of the Exhibition: The sale of cigarettes in our country has a long history. Recently, sales have gradually increased, and manufacturers have competed with each other, creating a grand scene. In the beginning, the tobacco was actually controlled by foreign merchants. Since the May 30th Movement, the advocacy of using national goods has been overwhelming, refreshing the audience. At that time, Chinese merchants set up factories and competed with each other, inevitably fighting for market share. In addition, they were all affected by the economic downturn. If fellow countrymen do not rise up to maintain and promote them, it will be difficult to achieve great development. However, the products of Chinese and foreign tobacco companies are complex and numerous. Their names and patterns are confusing. If you are not careful, you will easily be misunderstood. There is no concept of comparison between rupees and money, or you are limited by what you have seen and heard, and there is no precise analysis. Alas! The Association is aware of this, and from September 12th to 21st, it will hold a National Goods Cigarette Exhibition at the Great World in Shanghai. All products from Chinese factories, including those whose trademarks are still mixed with foreign elements, will be marked with their qualities and displayed separately so that visitors can easily understand and translate them. At the same time, major newspapers in Shanghai will be invited to publish special issues on a daily basis to promote Chinese goods with large-scale publicity, so that patriotic compatriots who use national goods cigarettes can also get detailed and accurate guidance. Yuan Lvdeng, Shen Weiting, Shen Xingde, Lao Jingxiu, Jing Yimeng, Ding Houqing, Bao Gengsheng, Wu Linzhi, Sun Daosheng, Ding Shenbo, Shen Xuewen, Standing Committee Members of the China National Goods Cigarette Maintenance Association, sincerely invite you.</p>
<p>Full Participation: Since the organization of the association, the member cigarette factories in Shanghai have embraced the concept of coexistence and common prosperity, cooperating as one. In the exhibition, each member factory sells or displays products. The full list is as follows: Nanyang, Huacheng, Fuxin, Dadong, Zhonghe, Hexing, Dachunghua, Youcheng, Dexing, Sanxing, Huadong, Huada, Zhongnan, Liyu, Minzhong, Huapindelong, Ruilun, Cuizhong, Dingyi, Donghai, Huaxing, Dada, Jiangzhe, Youli, Xinmin, Meixing, Ximen, Jiuyi, Yazhou, Dachunghua, Huamei, Xinhua, Huabi, Dayou, Luxin, Daxing, Jiangnan, Huafu, Huafi.</p>
<p>List of Exhibits: For this exhibition, each cigarette factory invited experts to arrange and express the characteristics of their products in art as much as possible. This feature has never been seen in previous exhibitions. The location numbers are determined by the standing committee members Yuan Lvdeng and Shen Weiting. The order is as follows: No. 1 Huamei, No. 1 Lixing, No. 2 Nanyang, No. 4 Huading, No. 5 Dadong, No. 6 Huacheng, No. 7 Cuizhong, No. 8 Hexing, No. 9 Dadongnan, No. 10 Huadong, No. 11 Zhongnan, No. 12 Dexing, No. 13 Huafi, No. 14 Fuxin.</p>
<p>Four Major Features of the Exhibition: In a very short period of one month, after the enthusiastic preparation of the staff and the joint design of artists, in addition to the chess competition, four unprecedented features were created: (1) A national goods cigarette model, eight zhang and eight chi long, soaring into the clouds, can be called the world's first largest cigarette. (2) The national goods cigarettes displayed in each room are all arranged ingeniously and originally, with colorful lights, creating a grand scene. (3) A specially made rotating lantern, as big as a wheel, exquisite and translucent, filled with electric lights, the characters are especially humorous and lively. (4) Various cigarettes are displayed and sold at the exhibition site, allowing ladies from all walks of life to purchase and try them.</p>
<p>Chess Competition: In order to promote national essence and advocate for legitimate entertainment, the association will hold an open chess championship at the chess hall on the fourth floor of the Great World from today. The competition time is from 7:00 PM every night. Each game consists of three rounds, with the winner of one round being the winner. Today, the elimination system will be adopted. A total of 160 people will participate in the competition. At that time, there will be an extraordinary sight of intrigue. Chess experts Xie Bingyi and Huang Xuanchu will replay the chess scores of Chess Saint Xie Xiaxun against various players in Nanyang and other places to enhance interest. All registered players are requested to attend on time. If non-amateurs are found to be participating at that time, the competition will be stopped to comply with the regulations.</p>
<p>Overview of Cigarette Donations: During the exhibition period, national goods cigarettes will be given away with the Great World admission tickets every day, one pack per ticket. The sequence is as follows: First time, 12th, "Nanyang donates Hongjinlong or Flying Boat brand; second time, 13th, "Huacheng" Golden Mouse brand; third time, 14th, "Fuxin" Jiabao brand; fourth time, 15th, "Huamei" Hongmaisi; fifth time, 16th, "Hexing" Hongmei brand; sixth time, 17th, "Dadongnan" Gaorifu or Yaerai; seventh time, 18th, "Huadong" Haijingbo; eighth time, 19th, "Huafi" Black Girl; ninth time, 20th, "Lixing" Kekai brand; tenth time, 21st, "Dexing" Sanbei brand.</p>
<p>Today Nanyang: The opening today is by Nanyang Cigarette Company. A box of Hongjinlong or Flying Boat brand cigarettes will be given to each person with the ticket. Nanyang has the longest history in the history of Chinese cigarettes. It was the first factory to advocate for Chinese cigarettes, and the first factory that Chinese people loved to smoke. In the exhibition, a strange human head is displayed, which can automatically smoke cigarettes all day long, which is also a special display in the exhibition.</p>
<h3>The Fourth Day of the Public Catholic Action Congress, Discussing the Development of Public Catholic Education and Running a Public Catholic Newspaper to Promote Doctrines</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the fourth day of the National Diocesan Congress of the Chinese Catholic Action. In the morning, there were speeches and discussions on public Catholic education. In the afternoon, in addition to the meeting of the Pre-trial Committee, Archbishop Cai led the bishops of various dioceses across the country in a joint meeting. The content of the bishop's meeting could not be known because it was not open to the public. At 5:00 PM, a speech and discussion meeting on the public Catholic press was held. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Discussion of Educational Issues in the Morning</p>
<p>Yesterday, the representatives of the Catholic Action went to the hall at 5:30 AM to listen to the doctrine, attended the Mass of Archbishop Pu Yu Tang at 6:00 AM to receive the Holy Body, and then went to Pu Yu Tang at 7:30 AM to attend the Mass of Bishop Hu of Taizhou. At 9:00 AM, a seminar on educational issues was held in the main hall of Zhengxiu. Chairman Lu Bohong reported on the congratulations received, Zhang Huai drafted the speech, and Niu Yiwei gave a speech on how to Catholicize schools. He first stated the importance of education and the characteristics of public Catholic education, and then discussed public Catholic education and Catholic schools based on the Code of Canon Law. He also mentioned neutral schools in our country's educational laws. He also discussed how to Catholicize schools in the current situation, as well as the criticisms of church schools by non-Catholics, and the efforts that should be made in public Catholic education. Next, Jiang Chentao gave a speech on behalf of Li Zhengfu, on the government's educational laws and public Catholic schools. The speech was roughly divided into six points: (1) The relationship between Catholicism and education; (2) The restrictions of government educational laws on religious education; (3) An overview of the restrictions of government educational laws on religious education; (4) The reasons for the restrictions of government educational laws on religious education; (5) The true meaning of public Catholic education; (6) The key points for the development of public Catholic schools. In addition, Aurora University, Fu Jen Catholic University, and Tianjin Industry and Commerce University successively released school reports. Yu Bin, the director of the National Catholic Schools Inspection, also gave a report. It is estimated that there are three universities, more than 200 middle schools, and more than 4,000 elementary schools in national Catholic education. They are currently on the road to development. It is hoped that the members of the Catholic Action will work hard and discuss educational issues. More than ten proposals were all approved after review, in order to follow the national government's policies, carry out public Catholic education, and serve the people of the whole country. Finally, Bishop Shi gave a speech and dismissed the meeting.</p>
<p>The Press Rescues the People</p>
<p>At 2:30 PM, the Pre-trial Public Review Committee was held. In addition, all the bishops also held a joint meeting, which was not open to the public, so the content could not be known. The seminar began at 5:00 PM. Dai Rihui spoke on "Chongguang Communications Agency", Xu Chongze spoke on "The Public Catholic Publishing Industry in Our Country in Recent Years", Wen Zhenhua spoke on "Discussion on Public Catholic Magazines", Cai Renyu spoke on "National Catholic Action Publications" "Observation", and Liu Huoxuan spoke on "How to Run a Public Catholic Newspaper". Finally, Archbishop Cai gave a speech, saying that the Pope once said that the press is the breath of Catholicism. In other words, Catholicism cannot live its life without a press. Today's bishop's meeting discussed this issue. The bishops believe that it is not easy to achieve the goals of evangelizing, protecting the church, and saving China without a good press. Therefore, Luke Er said that the press can be used to destroy the people. The bishop also believes that the press must also be used to rescue the people. I hope that all the representatives will work hard in the press, actively evangelize and save China and the people. Later, Bishop Gu gave a speech and passed five proposals for the development of the press, and dismissed the meeting. At 8:00 PM, the students of Zhengxiu Middle School performed the ancient sacred drama of Bisser to entertain the representatives.</p>
<p>General Public Catholic Higher Education</p>
<p>Public Catholic higher education in China is quite noticeable to the society. Yesterday was the fourth day of the National Diocesan Congress of the Chinese Catholic Action. The congress specifically discussed public Catholic education, and there were reports from the three public Catholic universities, Aurora University, Fu Jen Catholic University, and Tianjin Industry and Commerce University. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency briefly recorded the report, hoping to gain a general understanding. "Aurora University" was founded in Shanghai by Mr. Ma Xiangbo in 1903. In 1904, when Governor-General Zhou Fu opened the government in Jiangnan, he submitted a case for approval. In 1912, the Beijing government approved the filing. In 1932, the National Government re-approved the establishment of the school. Aurora University is now divided into three colleges, six departments, and one specialty: (1) The College of Law is divided into the Department of Law and the Department of Political Economy; (2) The College of Science and Engineering is divided into the Department of Physics, the Department of Electrical Engineering, the Department of Civil Engineering, and the Department of Chemical Industry; (3) The College of Medicine is not divided into departments, and there is a special dental specialty. In addition to the university, there are also high and junior high school divisions. Outside the school, there are three attached middle schools in Yangzhou, Nanjing, and Songjiang. In Shanghai, there were 650 students and 80 faculty members in the last academic year. The College of Law and the College of Medicine are the best. Because the Special Zone Court is nearby, there is the opportunity to recruit excellent teachers to serve as professors. The College of Medicine has the convenience of Guangci Hospital for internships. "Fu Jen" was founded in Beijing in 1925, initially called Fu Jen Society. Two years later, it was changed to a university. In 1929, the Ministry of Education issued an order that all universities must have three colleges. Therefore, Fu Jen only had a College of Liberal Arts first. In the same year, it added a College of Science and a College of Education. It is now divided into twelve departments. There are affiliated high and junior high schools. The university department has more than 700 students and more than 150 faculty members. The middle school department has more than 400 students and more than 80 faculty members. The school's characteristic is that it plans to establish eight research laboratories, four of which have been completed: (1) Chemistry, specializing in the study of soil in North China; (2) Physics, specializing in the study of ultrasound; (3) Biology, specializing in the study of typhoid fever; (4) Sinology, specializing in the study of ancient Xiaoxue texts. "Tianjin Industry and Commerce" College was founded in Tianjin in 1922, initially as a university. In 1931, an affiliated middle school was added. In August, it was approved by the Ministry of Education and renamed College. The College of Engineering includes civil engineering and mechanical engineering, and the College of Commerce includes finance, economics, and commerce. The affiliated middle school includes high and junior high schools. The school has more than 700 students, and most of the students work in industry and commerce. The school has the North China Museum, which collects a wide range of agricultural, mining, geological, and animal and plant materials from the two major river basins of the Yellow River and the Hai River, which has great scientific value.</p>
<h3>Hu Ganqing's Son, Hu Ji'an, Is Accused of Embezzling Inheritance. The Plaintiff Admits to Being Ganqing's Adopted Son, Claiming to Have Been Taken Back from an Orphanage as a Child</h3>
<p>Hu Ganxiang, a native of Hangzhou who was the owner of Boda Dechang Jiuchu and other ginseng shops in Shanghai, passed away on June 18, 1929. All his businesses and the residence at No. 132 Guling Road were inherited by his son, Hu Ji'an (35 years old). Now, a man from Hangzhou named Hu Shengyan hired lawyer Wang Lushiang to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court, accusing Hu Ji'an of embezzling inheritance. The reason for the lawsuit is roughly as follows: The plaintiff was adopted from the Suzhou Orphanage when he was young. Shen Jifang introduced Hu Ganxiang and his wife, Zhu, to take him back from the orphanage as their son, and named him Hu Sheng. Later, the defendant was born. They ate and studied together. Later, the defendant saw that his parents loved the plaintiff very much, so he became jealous and found a way to make the servant take him out. The servant secretly returned and abandoned the plaintiff in Suzhou. Although he was able to return to Shanghai later, the defendant did not allow him to meet his parents, causing the plaintiff to wander outside and suffer a lot. In the spring of 1928, his father died, leaving behind ginseng shops such as Boda Dechang Jiukang, housing on Guling Road, and shares in Hu Qingyu Tang. The plaintiff happened to be working outside and could not take care of it, causing all the inheritance to fall into the hands of the defendant. Repeated requests for analysis were rejected, which constituted a crime under Article 335, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and he should be ordered to return the inheritance that should be analyzed to the plaintiff. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Daxii of the First Special District Court opened the Second Criminal Court for questioning. The defendant Hu Ji'an hired lawyers Lin Qing and Xi Yafu. According to Hu Sheng's statement, he was adopted by Hu Ganqing when he was young, and then he was abandoned, causing me to be very distressed and unable to maintain my life. Therefore, I asked the defendant to give me some money. The court asked whether he wanted to punish the defendant criminally. He replied, "My purpose is money, and I don't want to punish the defendant." Judge Huang said that according to the plaintiff's statement, it was obviously contrary to what was stated in the lawsuit, and he repeatedly questioned the plaintiff and his representative lawyer Wang Lushiang about everything. The defendant stated that the plaintiff's real name was Li Yu, and he was brought from the orphanage by Li Chunnian, the father's accountant, and then he ran away. Recently, he met him at the entrance of Zhang Yongchang Wuquanhai on Huaihai Road and borrowed 200 yuan from him. At first, he could not recall it, but later he remembered it. Now he is falsely using the name of Hu Sheng to file a lawsuit against me, which is obviously instigated by others and intends to extort money. The attorney for the defendant believed that there was suspicion of instigation, and verbally filed a countersuit for false accusation against the plaintiff. And his lawyer replied that according to the plaintiff's own statement, he is 37 years old this year. He was taken back by Hu Ganqing in his infancy. If we examine the year, it should be in the 27th year of Guangxu. However, according to the investigation, the Suzhou Orphanage was founded in April of the first year of the Republic of China, which is obviously inconsistent with the facts. After the two parties debated in court, it was decided that the verdict would be announced on the afternoon of the 16th.</p>
<h3>Litigation over Moving Disputes, Opinions Arising from Public Bonds, Unable to Sleep Due to the Establishment of a General Assembly - Good Friends Actually Have Opinions</h3>
<p>Hui Ning Huang Zansu, an old man, studied medicine and practiced medicine on Tibet Road, where he also lived. Because he had extra rooms in his house, he sublet them to Zhao Hanqing, who moved in with his family. Although Huang and Zhao only met by chance, they were close friends. In addition to being a doctor, Huang also ran a business, but he did not do it himself. His nephew, Huang Yunxin, was responsible for planning and calculating. In the summer, Yunxin and his friends jointly invested in customs tax treasury bonds. Zhao heard about it and was envious, so he asked Yunxin to buy bonds with a face value of 10,000 yuan. He used the 500 yuan loan that his friend gave him during the day as collateral to pay the deposit. Later, the market price of public bonds gradually declined. When the settlement period arrived, the accounts were settled, and Zhao lost more than 790 yuan. Yunxin used the exchange bills to urge him to quickly repay the debt. Unexpectedly, Zhao suddenly became unreasonable, saying that the power of attorney was difficult to verify, but other procedures were not prepared, and he only had 900 yuan of financial resources. Now, the debt exceeded his ability to pay, so it was difficult to recognize it, and the 500 yuan would have to wait until his friend returned it before he could pay it back, so it had not been settled. Last month, Zhao suddenly claimed that Huang had leased the remaining house to others to establish a general assembly, resulting in prostitutes gathering and gambling, which made his family unable to sleep day and night. He wanted to return the lease and move elsewhere. At that time, Huang's family members asked him to pay off the rent he owed and the public debt loss together before moving. Zhao did not want to repay the debt, but instead filed a complaint with the First Special District Court, accusing Huang Zansu of illegally restricting his move, obstructing his freedom, and fraud. The complaint also stated that Huang's family had three younger sisters, all of whom were bought by Huang at his expense to serve as maids. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui opened the court to hear the case. First, Zhao Hanqing gave his statement, admitting that he had entrusted the purchase of treasury bonds, but he was unwilling to bear the loss. He also denied owing rent, saying that according to his calculations, he had overpaid dozens of dollars. As for his desire to move, it was because he had an 80-year-old mother who could not bear the disturbance day and night, and he could not bear to watch his mother die, so he decided to move. He was temporarily stopped by the defendant, so he is still living in the original place. When questioned by Huang Zansu, the old man seemed to be uncaring about household affairs. He could not answer any questions asked in court, and his hands were trembling. Later, he asked to question his nephew. The court then questioned Huang Yunxin in detail about the public bond situation. The defendant's lawyer then presented a marriage certificate, stating that the three women in Huang's family were Yunxin's wife, his wife's younger sister, and Huang's adopted daughter. The defendant's statement that they were maids was defamatory, so the defendant filed a countersuit. Judge Liu ruled that this point should be filed in another case, and then ordered both parties to wait for the verdict to be announced on a scheduled date.</p>
<h3>Murder of a Widow: Police Investigation Reveals Truth, Not a Love Affair But a Plot to Seize Her Property</h3>
<p>The widow, Madam Gu Xu, a local resident living at No. 140 Tonglefang, Pu'an Jishi Road, French Concession, is 30 years old. Her husband, Gu Zhiming, died of illness two years ago. She has endured hardship to maintain her chastity. On October 31st, at 11 p.m., while she was sitting at the entrance of the Shun Yu Restaurant at No. 142 next door to enjoy the cool air, she was suddenly attacked by a thug wielding a sharp axe. Without saying a word, he struck Madam Xu in the head with the axe and ran away. Madam Xu fell to the ground unconscious. Neighbors reported the incident to the French police station by telephone. Other neighbors who were also enjoying the cool air helped to chase after the assailant. They chased him to the intersection of Pu'an Jishi Road and Manshi Road, where they encountered French police detectives Zhang Ziying and Zuo Qihong, who were patrolling in a police car. Seeing a man running towards them with an axe in his hand, the detectives stopped the car and arrested him. Under interrogation, he confessed that his name was Qian Maozhao, 31 years old, from Haizhou, residing in a shed on Yangshupu Road. He admitted that he had used the axe to wound Gu Xu. He stated that Li Fenggang (40 years old), from Siyang, residing at No. 29, Lane 255, Taihe Lane, Yangshupu Road, had instructed him to do so. Li had first pointed out Gu Xu to him so that he could clearly see her face, and then he went up and injured her. Li had now fled back to his home. At the time, Li had promised to give him 100 yuan after the job was done, etc. The detectives took Wang back to the police station. After reporting the information to the police chief, they immediately took Wang Maozhao to the Yangshupu police station to request that detectives be dispatched to assist in arresting his accomplice, Li Feng. They drove to Li's house in a car, and the journey was very fast. However, Li Fenggang had walked home after the incident, which took him a considerable amount of time. The detectives waited in his house for about an hour before they saw Li slowly return from outside. They arrested him and brought him back to the French police station for interrogation. According to Li Fenggang's confession, he was instructed by the fugitive, Zi Ping. The reason was that Li Ziping had previously had an affair with Gu Xu, but recently Xu had abandoned the old and made new friends, falling in love with a plasterer. Therefore, he harbored resentment and was willing to pay 400 yuan to have someone kill Xu. It is currently unknown where Li Ziping has fled. The next day, the police station sent the two suspects to the Special First Court on charges of attempted premeditated murder and requested their detention for further investigation. The victim, Gu Xu, was ordered by the police station to be sent to the hospital for treatment. Fortunately, her injuries were minor, and she was discharged from the hospital in a few days to recuperate at home. Wang and Li, the two suspects, have been closely investigated by the French Police Department. The investigation concluded that the confessions of the two suspects were untrue. It was determined that the case was not due to a love affair, but because the victim had some assets, which were coveted by members of her clan. They fabricated scandalous accusations against her in order to seize her property. Yesterday morning at 10 a.m., Wang Gangxu, the criminal court judge of the Special Second Court, and clerk Zheng Rong came to the First Criminal Court for interrogation. Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the Police Department, explained the circumstances of the investigation and filed charges based on the crime of attempted premeditated murder under the criminal law. The victim, Gu Xu, also appeared in court to describe the incident of being attacked and hired lawyer Wang Qizong as her agent to present her family background and the circumstances of the attack. When questioned, the first defendant, Wang Maozhao, still claimed that he had been invited by Li Fenggang to commit the crime. The second defendant, Li Fenggang, gave the same confession as he had given at the police station, admitting that he was instructed by Li Ziping to invite Wang to kill the victim. After reviewing the confessions, the court decided to adjourn the hearing for two days to appoint a defense lawyer for further interrogation. The two defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Jardine Matheson's Large Iron Barge "St. Albans" Sinks Again</h3>
<p>The Jardine Matheson's iron barge "St. Albans" was sailing on the Huangpu River at 4:45 a.m. on March 8th, approximately 800 feet upstream from the No. 11 buoy, about 600 feet from the Shanghai shore, intending to tow the wooden ship "Argyll." Unexpectedly, it collided head-on with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Jiangshun" steamer. The "St. Albans" hull was caught on the iron anchor hook of the "Jiangshun's" bow, causing the hull to be pierced. Before it could be dislodged from the "Jiangshun's" anchor, the "St. Albans" immediately sank into the Huangpu River. The "Jiangshun" also suffered damage at the time. The iron barge had a very strong hull and a good engine, capable of towing large passenger ships of 30,000 tons in and out of the Huangpu River. Jardine Matheson spent more than 200,000 yuan on its construction, so after it sank, they decided to salvage it. The company sent technicians and divers, as well as barges, to the location where the "St. Albans" sank to carry out salvage work. They overcame various difficulties, first clearing the mud and sand from the cabins, and then using cement and wooden planks to fill the holes. Then, they pumped the water out of the cabins to make it float back to the surface of the river. From the start of the salvage operation to patching the holes and raising it to the surface, it took a total of five months, and the various costs amounted to a huge sum of 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Just yesterday, while it was being towed into the dock, it suffered another accident.</p>
<p>Second Sinking. Since the "St. Albans" was salvaged from the river, the Jianghai Customs had issued a notice rescinding the restrictions on shipping traffic on the Huangpu River. Jardine Matheson had also decided to tow the barge to the Ruirong Shipyard for major repairs in the dock. Yesterday at around 10:30 p.m., Jardine Matheson ordered the "St. Albans" to be towed to the Ruirong Shipyard. Unexpectedly, when it reached the river surface near the Ruirong Shipyard, the barge had to turn around before entering the dock as usual. Unexpectedly, the cement used to patch the holes suddenly gave way, and river water rushed back into the cabins of the "St. Albans" barge, causing the hull to sink rapidly into the Huangpu River again. Five months of rescue efforts were ruined in a single day, which is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>Continued Rescue Planned. This reporter visited Jardine Matheson yesterday to inquire about the situation. The "St. Albans" barge is now submerged in the river in front of the Ruirong Shipyard, slightly higher than the first sinking. The smokestack, mast, and bow are all above the surface of the river, and can be seen as soon as you reach Yangshupu. The company still plans to continue the salvage operation for the second sinking of the "St. Albans" and will not stop its rescue efforts. However, the cost of the loss will be even greater.</p>
<h3>Young Unemployed Man Attempts Suicide with Poison: Cries of Anguish Emanate from Room, Treatment is Prompt and Hopeful</h3>
<p>At around 9 p.m. last night, a young man, approximately 20 years old, wearing a white serge suit, accompanied by a fashionably dressed young woman, checked into the Central Hotel on Guangdong Road. The hotel clerk led them to room 127 for their accommodation. The young man wrote his name as Shao Caiping, 24 years old, from Hangzhou, a businessman, in the registration book. After the tea server brought in tea, the two closed the door and talked privately. It wasn't until around 11 p.m. that the young woman left and went downstairs. Unexpectedly, a short while later, the tea server heard cries of anguish coming from the room. He immediately knocked on the door and peeked inside, and saw the young man swallowing poison, trying to commit suicide. The tea server rushed forward to snatch it away, but it was too late. He reported the incident to the front desk, who in turn reported it to the police station and had him taken to the hospital for treatment. Fortunately, he was discovered very early, so he is expected to be out of danger. Three suicide notes were found on his person, mostly expressing that he was suffering from economic hardship. It was also learned that the young man had worked in the remittance department of the Jiande Bank on Tianhougong Bridge. Since the bank went bankrupt, he had also become unemployed, unable to find a way to make a living, and therefore took this desperate measure.</p>
<h3>Russian Man Swallows Tranquilizer Pills and Dies: Suicide on Bifang Road</h3>
<p>On the western outskirts of Shanghai, in the cotton fields behind Bajiatang, east of Bifang Road at the Feijiachang Airport, at around 5 p.m. the day before yesterday, a Russian man (male), approximately 40 years old, was seen wandering in the fields. He was confused and seemed ill. Not long after, he collapsed on the ground and died. A suicide note was found on the body, stating that he was suffering from economic hardship and therefore swallowed tranquilizer pills to commit suicide. Yesterday, the village head Zhang Xuegen, since the deceased had no family, took the initiative to collect and bury the body.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways Standardizes Timetable Times for All Routes</h3>
<p>China's railways are currently under active construction and are gradually expanding westward. The territory is vast, making it difficult to use a single time standard across the country. In light of this, the Ministry of Railways, during the ninth National Railway Transport Conference, resolved to standardize timetable times for all routes and to regulate the timing of connections in order to ensure accuracy. It also adopted the five time zones for the country determined by the Astronomical Research Institute and issued an order to all railway bureaus to follow them. The time zones and ministry orders are extracted below.</p>
<p>Standard Time Zones</p>
<p>The five time zones for the entire country designated by the Astronomical Research Institute are: (1) The Central Plains Zone, which uses the time of 120 degrees east longitude as the standard. It includes the fifteen provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangdong, Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei, Henan, Jehol, Chahar, and Liaoning, as well as Longkou, Nenkou, Aihui, Hanhe, and Hulun, west of these regions in Heilongjiang. (2) The Sichuan Zone, which uses the time of 105 degrees east longitude as the standard. It includes the eight provinces of Suiyuan, Ningxia, Gansu, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangxi, and Yunnan, as well as Mongolia, Xining in Qinghai, and Dege in Xikang. (3) The Tibet Zone, which uses the time of 90 degrees east longitude as the standard. It includes Xinjiang, Tibet, Mongolia, Changdu in western Xikang, western Qinghai, and Anxi in western Gansu. (4) The Kunlun Zone, which uses the time of 82.9 degrees east longitude as the standard. It includes Suiding, Yining, and Liufu in Xinjiang, and western Tibet. (5) The Changbai Zone, which uses the time of 137.5 degrees east longitude as the standard. It includes Dalail, Lindian, and Qikete in eastern Jilin and Heilongjiang.</p>
<p>Ministry Order to Comply</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways instructed all railway bureaus: "It has been found that the time at the Xi'an Station on the Pinghan Railway and the Longhai Railway differs from the time in Hangzhou by about 40 minutes. As the Longhai Railway continues to extend westward, the difference in distance will become even greater. If the train schedules on the western sections of these two routes are not adjusted, the difference between the schedules and the local time will be too great, which is not appropriate. The Pinghan Railway and the Longhai Railway should immediately adopt the times of the Central Plains and Sichuan zones. All other routes should use the time of the Central Plains zone. The Pingdiquan Station on the Pinghan Railway and the Tongguan Station on the Longhai Railway should be designated as the changeover stations for each route. The times at each station and all stations west of each station should uniformly use the time of the Sichuan zone. The stations east of each station should use the time of the Central Plains zone. All trains traveling from east to west on these two routes should reduce the time by one hour when arriving at the Pingdiquan and Tongguan stations before continuing westward. When trains traveling from west to east depart from Pingdiquan and Tongguan, the time should be increased by one hour. In the train schedule, a horizontal line should be added under the name of the changeover station, and the words 'Sichuan Zone Time' or 'Central Plains Zone Time' should be added to the notes for clarity. In addition, the standard clocks at the changeover stations should use two hands (one red and one black). The black hand indicates the time in the current zone, and the red hand indicates the time in the Central Plains Zone for reference. The method of synchronizing the time should still be carried out in accordance with the instructions in General Order No. 2561 issued on July 18th of this year, which stipulates the time dissemination method. After each route receives the Central Plains Zone time broadcast by the Ministry, those using Central Plains Zone time should carefully synchronize the time chain. Those using Sichuan Zone time should immediately subtract one hour from the broadcast Central Plains Zone time and carefully synchronize the time. In addition, the timepieces used by train and shunting personnel must first be inspected by a designated inspector and be given a certificate before they can be worn. The certificate must be replaced after six months. Before starting work each day, each employee must synchronize their timepiece with the standard clock in the station. If there is no standard clock at the work location, they should synchronize their timepiece with another train employee who has a standard timepiece. They should also synchronize with all relevant employees before starting work to avoid discrepancies. A map of the Chinese time zones and explanations of the map as determined by the Astronomical Research Institute are attached to the order for reference, and are separately ordered for compliance. This order." (Time zone map and explanations omitted)</p>

<p>Issuing of Viewing Tickets</p>
<p>The enthusiastic participation in this marriage shows the society's eagerness for group weddings. It's more than expected. The organizers are extremely pleased with the results. However, the Municipal Government Auditorium can only accommodate 1,000 seats. If each participating couple is given four viewing tickets, plus two for the officiant, there are more than 1,000 people already. In order to maintain order in the auditorium, it is said that viewing tickets will not be issued additionally. However, those who want to watch can still watch most of the ceremony in the square in front of the government building. It is anticipated that the streets will be extraordinarily lively on the day of the wedding.</p>
<p>5th Session Registration</p>
<p>The 5th group wedding will be held in the Municipal Government Auditorium on December 4th. Registration will begin on October 1st and end on October 21st. It is said that due to the limited capacity of the auditorium, only 100 couples will be allowed to participate. Citizens who wish to participate can enclose postage and write to the Public Welfare Section of the Social Affairs Bureau to request information and application forms for early preparation.</p>
<h3>Insurance Industry Association Sends Representatives to Petition in the Capital</h3>
<p>Reducing Stamp Duty on Insurance Policies: The Insurance Industry Association, because the new stamp duty rate requires insurance policies to be stamped according to the amount of insurance, which is vastly different from the previous provisional regulations that stamped according to the actual premium received, making it difficult to bear, has repeatedly petitioned the central government agencies to approve a reduction. It is now heard that the Ministry of Finance has agreed to submit a request to the Executive Yuan to transfer it to the Legislative Yuan for review. The association convened an extraordinary meeting, and four representatives, Xu Kesheng, Tao Tingxuan, Xiang Xinwu, and Zai Shumei, set off for the capital immediately to personally present their grievances to the central government agencies, hoping for a prompt decision to alleviate the commercial difficulties.</p>
<h3>Newest Invention: Automatic Anti-Theft Device, Good News for Sea Travelers</h3>
<p>In recent years, cases of pirates looting along China's coastal routes have emerged frequently. Although various ships are equipped with weapons, in reality, the effectiveness of the defense is still not apparent. Wireless expert Mr. Baigeman, in view of this, has been diligently researching methods of using wireless signals to defend against pirates in his self-created Wireless Engineering Research Institute. Recently, after several tests, success has been achieved. He has submitted the design and instructions for the automatic anti-theft wireless signal device to the Ministry of Transportation for sale in the country. After various ships are equipped with this device, in the event of a robbery, by moving the main switch, a powerful signal will be automatically emitted into space. Upon hearing the signal, anti-piracy speedboats from all directions can quickly sail to the location of the incident to rescue them. Therefore, equipping this device is not only effective, but also more economical than equipping weapons. This new invention is undoubtedly good news for all ships at sea.</p>
<h3>Preparatory Staff of National Games Purchase Large Quantity of Leonidas Stopwatches</h3>
<p>The Shuanglong Foreign Company, located at No. 44 Nanjing Road, has been in business for more than 50 years, specializing in the sale of various high-quality clocks and watches, as well as jewelry, silverware, and optical mirrors. The goods are genuine and the prices are fair, and it has a good reputation. Yesterday, several members of the preparatory committee of this year's National Games specifically purchased 28 Swiss Leonidas stopwatches from the company for use during the National Games, because their mechanism is strong and their timekeeping is accurate, which is beyond what ordinary stopwatches can provide.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Dahua Hotel Opens for Business</h3>
<p>The newly built Dahua Hotel, located at the intersection of Jiangjun Road and Hubin Road in Hangzhou, has been completed. The interior is decorated in a novel style, and the management by experts makes it even more perfect. Now that the tide season has arrived, it is said that many people have booked rooms in the hotel. Therefore, it will open for business today to meet the needs of all sectors.</p>
<h3>Great China Tragedy: Report Summary from the Public Works Department - Scrap Material's Spontaneous Combustion as the Biggest Cause of the Fire</h3>
<p>On June 28th of this year, at approximately 8 PM, a fire broke out at the Da Zhonghua Celluloid Toy Factory on Xiaoshadu Road due to carelessness with fire, causing a conflagration that spread to nearby Yongqing Lane. Over twenty people were burned to death, and over fifty were injured. The Special District Court has repeatedly investigated this matter, and the Public Works Department has also provided all relevant evidence to the court for reference. The court has now rendered its judgment, fining the factory's responsible parties three hundred yuan each. One other person was acquitted. The Public Works Department's relevant departments' report to the Board of Directors regarding the facts of this case are summarized below:</p>
<p>Factory Site and Buildings</p>
<p>The Public Works Department issued a permit on December 18, 1929, allowing the factory to construct three separate and unconnected factory buildings. Subsequently, on March 27th of the following year, a permit was issued for the construction of five attached buildings, each separate and unconnected, with ample open space around each building. On the construction plans, a building was marked as a "drying room," but it was never built. Therefore, the building permit for that structure soon expired. Afterward, the factory privately constructed an unpermitted building on the original site of the drying room. This building was the location of the fire mentioned above. There was another building nearby where a fire occurred once in mid-August of last year.</p>
<p>Warehouse Contents</p>
<p>The aforementioned building where the fire occurred was a single-story, square structure made of reinforced concrete and brick walls. The walls were originally about ten inches thick and about twelve feet high on the side bordering the alley, reaching the roof. The northeast and northwest walls were over nine feet high, each with window openings. Each window was about three feet in length and width. However, only one window was left open on each side; the others were bricked up. There was no electrical equipment inside the building. A brick wall was also built inside, dividing it into a smaller compartment for storage. Besides the four windows and one door, there were no other means of air circulation. According to the warehouse manager, the windows were never opened, and to prevent sunlight from entering, the windows were nailed shut with wooden boards. The roof was flat and made of concrete, so it was also airtight. Inside the building, near the roof, a steam pipe was installed, used to transport hot steam from the factory's boiler to the workers' bathhouse. The steam pipe was wrapped with asbestos rope and covering, and was still intact. However, it was not known if the branch pipe had any support. If there was no support, the weight of the branch pipe could cause the main steam pipe to leak.</p>
<p>Storage Overview</p>
<p>The building where the fire occurred was primarily used as a storage room, and it mostly stored celluloid scrap. According to post-incident investigations, on the day of the fire, the building contained: (1) 43,391 pounds of celluloid scrap, (2) some semi-finished toys, (3) some finished toys, (4) over twenty boxes of German-made celluloid sheets, (5) some camphor, and (6) machine parts.</p>
<p>Quantity of Scrap</p>
<p>Last August, the factory had 27,900 pounds of scrap material. However, after the first fire, the factory management intended to sell the scrap. From last August to this June, the factory sold no less than 44,000 pounds of scrap to the Zhongxing Celluloid Factory in the southern district. However, at the time of the second fire this year, the factory still had a substantial 43,000 pounds of scrap. Moreover, in this month, the Da Zhonghua branch factory in the southern district merged with the main factory on Xiaoshadu Road, increasing production and accelerating the accumulation of scrap. Therefore, in April, May, and June, the building contained around 50,000 pounds of scrap. This shows that although the Da Zhonghua factory did sell scrap materials continuously, the accumulation inside the factory was never significantly reduced. These scraps were stored in burlap sacks, and the height of the piles, at the time of the fire, some even reached the roof.</p>
<p>Chemical Composition</p>
<p>Commercial celluloid contains 50-70% nitrocellulose, 10-11% nitrogen, 25-35% camphor, and varying amounts of other softeners and colors. Camphor melts at 177 degrees Celsius and evaporates easily at room temperature. Celluloid is extremely flammable, producing thick smoke when burning, with temperatures rising to 1500 to 1700 degrees Celsius, and it spreads very quickly. According to chemical experts, nitrocellulose can decompose into cellulose and nitric acid. Whether it can spontaneously combust or explode is disputed. However, if the storage area is poorly ventilated, the heat generated may not dissipate easily. With additional external heat, the possibility of increasing the ignition point is obvious. Therefore, the International Labour Organization has regulations regarding the storage of celluloid scraps, including the need for well-ventilated storage buildings, electrical installations, and limiting the amount of material per pile to 8,000 to 10,000 pounds, stored in iron drums.</p>
<p>Factory Measures</p>
<p>Based on the above theory, many non-compliant aspects of the factory's measures can be discovered. For example, the amount of scrap piled up exceeded the usual regulations by four or five times. There was virtually no ventilation equipment. The scrap was stored in burlap sacks instead of iron drums, etc. However, to maintain worker safety, the Public Works Department ordered the factory to install an outdoor escape ladder and rebuild the original indoor staircase, and to isolate the spray-painting room on the upper floor. The factory had complied with all these requests. The factory had also promised to improve the storage of scrap and modify the interior of the room, but unfortunately, the fire occurred before these improvements were implemented.</p>
<p>Cause of the Fire</p>
<p>There are varying accounts of the cause of the fire. Broadly, they can be divided into two categories: (1) those that occurred outside the storage room, including (a) sparks from the factory's boiler chimney, and (b) sparks spreading from a fire in a neighboring building outside the factory; (2) those that occurred inside the storage room, including (a) caused by workers working or smoking in the storage room, (b) caused by a leak in the steam pipe, and (c) spontaneous combustion of scrap. The theory about boiler sparks spreading is highly improbable because the windows near the boiler on the southeast side were always closed and nailed shut with wood boards. The theory that a fire started in a neighboring street is even more unreliable because the southwest side of the factory had high walls, and all doors and windows were closed, so there was no possibility of sparks flying in. It is clear that this theory was fabricated by the related parties to shirk responsibility. If we consider the causes of the fire occurring inside the storage room, then the claim that it was caused by workers working or smoking is also unbelievable because the building closed at 4:30 PM, and there were no workers inside; otherwise, they would have died in the fire. Thus, hot steam escaping from the steam pipe and spontaneous combustion of scrap become the two final possible causes. However, according to post-incident investigations, the hot water pipe seemed to have been shut off beforehand. Therefore, in terms of the situation, spontaneous combustion of the scrap accounts for the largest component of the cause of the fire. Although whether celluloid scrap can spontaneously combust is still questionable, it is generally accepted that if it comes into contact with oily substances, it is possible for it to ignite. Furthermore, the scrap piled up in the room was swept up from the ground and then stored in burlap sacks, so it was quite possible that it was contaminated with oily substances. Moreover, after the fire, a bag of scrap was taken from the factory's workshop and examined for traces of oil stains. Unexpectedly, a piece of oil-stained cotton gauze and a piece of oil-stained cotton cloth were found. It can be seen that oil was not completely absent. Furthermore, burlap sacks were piled up like mountains in a stuffy room, and the weather was extremely hot, increasing the temperature, making spontaneous combustion of the scrap possible. Therefore, the cause of the fire can be said to be due to the excessive accumulation of oil-stained scrap and the lack of ventilation.</p>
<p>Fire Situation</p>
<p>After the celluloid burned, due to its explosive nature, it immediately blew the door of the small room in the northeast. The southwest wall then collapsed, and rockets of fire shot out, causing disaster to the adjacent Yongqing Lane. There were a total of eighty-six houses in the lane. A narrow street separated it, and it was only separated by bamboo cages. Thus, when the rockets of fire struck, they instantly became a prairie fire. A total of seven houses were completely burned down, four were largely burned down, and four were partially burned down. Twenty-seven men and women were burned to death, and forty to fifty people were injured. The dense population of the area was also a factor. The houses in the lane were all two-story buildings, averaging ten people per building, with at least four and as many as sixteen. It is said that some of the dead were sleeping on the mezzanine floors, making it impossible to escape when the fire broke out.</p>
<h3>Female Doctor Qu Yahong Delivers and Saves Both Mother and Child</h3>
<h3>Breech Birth Imminent Crisis - Surgical Skill Leads to Safe Escape</h3>
<p>At one o'clock on the afternoon of the 9th of this month, a pregnant woman surnamed Xin from Ningbo, Zhejiang, arrived at the Lai Yibo Pudong Hospital. Her husband, who worked in shipping, was away. The woman had been in labor pains for three days, but the baby had not yet been born. The midwife had tried everything, but the family could only call for help. A neighbor then carried her to Pudong Hospital. Dr. Cheng Linhong, the director of obstetrics, diagnosed a transverse presentation (commonly known as "shoulder presentation"). The baby's arm was already in the birth canal. If surgery was not performed, both mother and child would be lost. She immediately telegraphed the director of medical affairs, Dr. Qu Shaohong, president of the Shengsheng Hospital on Sapore Road in Shanghai, for instructions. Upon hearing the news, Dr. Qu immediately led his two daughters, Dr. Qu Yahong (a graduate of the Beiping Women's Obstetrics School in 1929, and who graduated this summer from the Tongde Medical College), and seven students, to Pudong Hospital overnight. When Dr. Qu and his party arrived at the hospital, the pregnant woman was crying out in agony. After examining her personally, Dr. Qu ordered his daughter, Yahong, to perform surgery (footling breech extraction). Before long, she extracted the baby's foot, and then the trunk, upper limbs, head, and placenta followed in rapid succession. However, because the baby had been compressed in the birth canal for too long, resuscitation efforts were made for two hours before it finally cried out. According to obstetrics experts, this birth was one of the most difficult kinds of dystocia. Usually, a laparotomy must be performed, or the baby's body must be cut off in order to remove it. Saving one life while sacrificing another is already a fortunate outcome for the family. Now, Dr. Yahong has managed to save both lives, truly a worthy descendant of a great family.</p>
<h3>Interpretation of the Chinese Bankruptcy Law to be Published</h3>
<p>China's bankruptcy law has now been promulgated and is scheduled to take effect on October 1st of this year. It is heard that Mr. Wang Qufei, a professor of law in Shanghai, has recently drawn on his experience with over ten years of research and teaching on this law to write a book, "Interpretation of the Bankruptcy Law," which will be published by the Shanghai Law Research Society. The contents of the book provide a systematic interpretation of the new bankruptcy law, and it makes extensive deductions regarding the latest legal principles related to the law, which will serve as a reference for academics and practitioners. Moreover, the binding is beautiful, and the front of the book includes a recent photograph of the author, as well as handwritten manuscripts and inscriptions by He Shizhen and Zhang Zhiben, etc., making it exceptionally valuable. Once it is published, it is expected that universities, judges, and lawyers across the country will each want a copy. Its sales are certainly expected to be high. The book is expected to be published around mid-May and will be sold by the Qixin Bookstore on Henan Road in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Fuli Road - Trafficker's Organization is Large-Scale</h3>
<h3>Two Houses and One Side Room with Four-Way Access</h3>
<h3>Female Trafficker Also Detained in a Hotel on Kadoorie Road</h3>
<p>The customs water police investigators, along with Chen Xiaoqian, an investigator from the Women and Children Relief Association, broke up a trafficking ring on the Hong Kong-bound Songshan Maru ship of the Nissin Company on the morning of the day before yesterday, recovering two abducted boys. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. However, the police believed that the organization of the trafficking ring was definitely not that simple, because it was hardly reasonable for only two old women to be taking three children out of the country for sale, and the two women were cursing each other. Therefore, they made detailed inquiries, and yesterday morning, they took the two children from the relief association for further investigation. The older children, Wei Changsheng and Shi Jinhai, gradually became more willing to reveal the truth when they saw that the detectives were kind and approachable.</p>
<p>They claimed that the story that they had taken a night train from Suzhou the night before, which was previously claimed, was what the traffickers had taught them. In reality, they had been in Shanghai for over ten days with several other children, staying in a certain building. Moreover, there were more than three children; there were also several men among the traffickers. The traffickers forced them to call the trafficker Zhang Tangshi "mother" by scaring or coaxing them. If they did not obey, they would be beaten on the palms with wooden boards. If they did obey, they would be rewarded with candy and toys. They were not allowed to go outside day or night for several days. Because there were a total of five or six children, after spending some time together, they</p>
<p>did not feel miserable</p>
<p>. However, there were still two or three boys who were taken out by the male traffickers several days ago. We only knew that they were taken to the Great World amusement park to see a show, but they have not returned yet. The six-year-old child, A Bing, also gradually dared to speak. He said that his name was Fang Bingsheng, and his family lived near the Cangmen Gate in Suzhou. His father set up a cigarette stall on the street. He was already studying books in kindergarten, etc. However, when asked for his father's name, he could not answer. The female investigator obtained this clue and brought Zhang Tangshi back for strict interrogation. At first, she still tried to deny it, but after repeated questioning, she finally admitted that the trafficking headquarters was located in the French Concession on</p>
<p>Fuli Road</p>
<p>at No. 5 Xixian Fang. The police sent detectives Cheng Yongnian, Li Wenqi, Shen Changshan, Liang Qingqing, etc., along with Tangshi and the two children, Wei Changsheng and Shi Jinhai, to the Lujiawan police station to jointly search the address. They saw that No. 5 Xixian Fang was two houses and one side room, with both front and back doors tightly locked. If you went out through the back door, you would be in another alley, which was a four-way access, the best place for traffickers to escape. The detectives broke through the door from the front alley and entered, finding that the interior</p>
<p>was quite large</p>
<p>with six or seven army beds and wooden bunks. The trafficker claimed that they were used for the abducted children to sleep on. They also had slang terms, calling abducting "picking up," calling buying children with money "doing," and</p>
<p>referring to the abducted children as "stones."</p>
<p>The two children pointed out one of the bunks behind the wing room as the one they slept on together. Then, they found many toys under the bed, all given by the traffickers. Shi Jinhai also pointed out</p>
<p>a tin can</p>
<p>as the one he had brought out from his home when he was abducted. The detectives then inspected the area and saw that there were many leftovers that the criminals had eaten, such as dried white cabbage, broad beans, chili peppers, etc., all dried and hard, and half a pot of rice porridge, which had already fermented. Observing this situation, they knew that when the gang saw that their secret had been exposed on the Songshan Maru, they had fled elsewhere. The detectives asked Zhang Tangshi again if there were any affiliated organizations elsewhere. Tangshi then confessed that the gang often rented rooms in the</p>
<p>Republic Hotel</p>
<p>at No. 335? Kadoorie Road, near the Tangjia Alley in the French Concession. The detectives went to the hotel again to search, and they arrested Wang Zhoushi (51 years old), a woman from Shaoxing who specialized in hiding abducted children, in the pavilion room. She was immediately taken back to the police station. According to Wang Zhoushi, she only took care of the children and did nothing else. However, the police believed that Ma Xigen, a carpenter from Pudong who lived at No. 5 next door to Shi's house, had a seven-year-old son named A Da who had been abducted at the same time as Shi. Yesterday, his wife, Yan, had gone to the police station to identify the children and cried bitterly when she saw that there was no son among the three children. Currently, the child is still missing, and there is still a</p>
<p>need for in-depth investigation</p>
<p>. They interrogated Tangshi again, and she finally confessed the truth, claiming that the child trafficking organization had a long history, but it had never been exposed because its actions were secretive. There had been multiple transactions (i.e., trafficking of children). In addition to the three children they had found, there were also children aged seven, twelve, and fifteen, who had been taken to Shantou for sale by two men and a woman several days ago. The detectives thought that although the identities of the twelve-year-old and fifteen-year-old children were</p>
<p>unknown</p>
<p>, the seven-year-old child was most likely Ma Xigen's missing son. However, since they had already left the country, there was nothing they could do except to send a telegram to the Shantou authorities requesting an investigation. The police chief interrogated them again and ordered the three women who had been arrested to be detained in the police station, and the two children were sent to the relief association for the night. They will all be sent to the local court for</p>
<p>interrogation today</p>
<p>. He also ordered the original detectives to strictly organize the remaining members of the ring to bring the case to justice.</p>

<p>Special Issue of the National Land Administration Conference</p>
<h3>Preparations for the National Land Administration Conference Convened by the Ministry of Interior</h3>
<p>Since the promulgation of the Land Law Enforcement Act, and concurrently with the issuance of a decree from the Executive Yuan regarding the separate regulations for the implementation dates and regions of each section of the Land Law, as well as the previously submitted draft of the Appraiser Appointment Regulations, which the Legislative Yuan has now resolved do not require legislative procedure and should be promulgated by decree as per the original draft, the ministry was ordered to deliberate and submit a proposal for approval.</p>
<p>The Ministry's opinion is that each section of the Land Law contains broad meanings and numerous articles. Considering the current actual situation in various localities, it would be better to clearly define implementation standards for each part of the Land Law, without temporarily limiting it to divisions by section, so as to provide a basis for various local governments. Therefore, with reference to central laws and local facts, a general outline of land administration implementation procedures for each province and city was separately formulated as the standard for land administration implementation. Furthermore, as the land administration methods previously implemented in various provinces and cities differed and were mostly inconsistent with the principles of the Land Law, they should be rectified according to the law to ensure the connection and coordination of laws and facts between the central and local governments. It was proposed to convene a national land administration conference with the heads of land administration from each province and city, as well as representatives from relevant ministries, to gather diverse opinions and plan for its implementation.</p>
<p>Consequently, in April of this year, the Executive Yuan issued a directive approving the Ministry's convocation of the National Land Administration Conference to thoroughly deliberate on issues related to the implementation dates and regions of each section of the Land Law, whether to separately formulate a general outline of land administration implementation procedures for each province and city, and the draft of the Appraiser Appointment Regulations.</p>
<p>Based on this case, the Ministry drafted various rules for the land administration conference and presented them for approval to be promulgated by ministerial order. It was decided to hold the first National Land Administration Conference at the Ministry in mid-June. Four types of draft proposals were prepared and sent to relevant ministries and provincial/municipal governments for detailed study, requesting them to sign opinions, together with their proposed motions and the names of designated representatives, to be submitted to the Ministry before May 30 for compilation and arrangement.</p>
<p>After this consultation, most provinces were able to reply on schedule, but a few provinces inevitably delayed, resulting in a failure to convene as scheduled. Subsequently, a second circular was issued in June of this year, confirming September 10 as the opening date for the conference. Those who had not submitted their proposed motions, opinions, and representative names were required to submit them to the Ministry by July 31. Those who had already submitted them were required to submit any supplementary materials by July 1. Furthermore, considering that September 10 was a Tuesday, the day of the Executive Yuan's regular administrative meeting, which might cause inconvenience to political affairs, the conference was rescheduled to begin at 8:00 AM on September 12 at the Ministry. This was reported to the Executive Yuan for record and communicated by telegram to relevant agencies to inform all attending representatives to attend on time.</p>
<p>Before the conference, it was necessary to understand the recent land administration implementation situation in each province and city. Therefore, engineer Wang Yingjiao was specially dispatched to the five provinces of Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan, and section chief Luo Lixue and others were sent to the Nanjing Municipal Government for on-site inspections and material collection. They all submitted detailed reports for reference.</p>
<p>In early August, the secretariat of the conference was organized in accordance with regulations. Luo Lixue was appointed as the chief secretary, and other staff members were appointed to begin preparations. In total, the conference designated 68 members from relevant ministries, provincial/municipal governments, and academic institutions. 51 motions and 17 signed opinions were received and separately organized. This is a general overview of the conference's preparatory process.</p>
<h3>Opening Address of the Land Administration Conference</h3>
<p>— Tao Luqian</p>
<p>The Ministry has been ordered to convene this first National Land Administration Conference. I am very pleased that everyone and representatives have come from afar, and that representatives from higher-level agencies have been sent to guide the conference. The Ministry's intention in convening this land administration conference is as follows:</p>
<p>Firstly, the Land Law Enforcement Act has been formally promulgated. The manner in which each section of the Land Law and the Enforcement Act should be implemented, in accordance with the law, requires the central land administration agency to separately define its implementation regions and dates, and to submit them to the National Government for determination by decree. The Ministry's opinion is that rather than stipulating the implementation region and date of each part of the Land Law individually by decree, which would not only be too cumbersome but also, based on factual observation, may encounter obstacles when implementing the entire section in some cases, it seems better to formulate the implementation standards for each part of the Land Law by article, and present them for approval and promulgation, so as to provide a basis for various provincial and municipal governments. However, this matter is of great importance and requires convening all provincial and municipal governments and relevant ministries for joint discussion to facilitate implementation.</p>
<p>Secondly, before the Land Law was implemented, many provinces and cities had proactively carried out land administration for local needs. However, the methods used in each area varied greatly. Although the Ministry had formulated a general outline of land administration procedures for various provinces and cities in 1934 and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation, so as to provide a basis for various localities, the projects already carried out by various provinces and cities before the promulgation of this outline were largely inconsistent with the statutory principles. Now that the Land Law and the Enforcement Act are about to be implemented, the land administration already carried out in various localities should be rectified in accordance with the law. How to consider both the law and the facts, and ensure proper handling, necessitates convening the personnel in charge of land administration in various localities for detailed discussion.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the common difficulty in land administration in various localities is the insufficient or complete lack of funding. How to determine the source of land administration funding in various localities without increasing the burden on the people requires extensively collecting the opinions of various provincial and municipal governments to formulate a common method.</p>
<p>The above are the important reasons for the Ministry's convocation of this land administration conference. Furthermore, as various local governments have been engaged in land administration for many years, they have accumulated rich experience, and I hope to borrow this opportunity for joint discussion. Whether there are any laws and regulations already established by the central government that are difficult to implement in practice can also be fully raised to form a common opinion. The Ministry can then forward these to facilitate appropriate revisions to achieve perfection.</p>
<p>At the beginning of today's opening session, I especially hope that the various central agencies will provide more guidance. During the conference, I hope that all attendees will carefully study the proposals from all parties, so that the resolutions of this conference will not be empty and that the future of national land administration will have a common compass, bringing limitless benefits. This is what the Ministry sincerely wishes.</p>
<h3>The Mission of the Land Administration Conference</h3>
<p>— Xu Xiuzhi</p>
<p>Land consolidation is an important policy for realizing the Principle of People's Livelihood. The scarcity of agricultural products in our country, coupled with the encroachment by powerful landlords, frequent land disputes, and rural unrest, are mostly caused by the improper use of land, disordered boundaries, unfair distribution, and unbalanced burdens. To improve this situation, land consolidation is the primary plan. Therefore, Sun Yat-sen took land consolidation as the basic work to be implemented at the beginning of local self-government, and especially took making the best use of land and enabling the people to have the right to evenly enjoy land as the guiding principles for building a nation based on the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>The National Government, following Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, formulated the Land Law in 1930, hoping to gradually equalize land rights and achieve the goal of "land to the tiller." However, because the enforcement regulations could not be formulated and promulgated immediately, they could not be promoted early. Provinces and cities,迫於整理地籍之必要,间有先行拟订单行法现,提前举办者。惟各地办法旣多不同，步骤亦难一致。内政部适奉令暂管中央土地行政，爱依照土地法原则，拟订各省市举办地政程序大纲，呈院核定颁行，以为各省市在土地法未施行前举办地政之依据。同时遵令拟具土地法施行法草案，呈院核转立法院审议。</p>
<p>Now that the Land Law Enforcement Act has been promulgated, the Ministry of Interior has also convened the first National Land Administration Conference in Beijing with the heads of land administration from across the country. This is because more than 20 provinces and cities have successively implemented land administration matters. Those with faster progress have even reached the procedures of land registration and valuation for taxation. However, due to the different conditions in each region and the varying human and financial resources, the implementation situation is quite uneven. In terms of land registration clarification, some have formally conducted surveys, some have carried out field measurement investigations, and some have conducted land reporting; in terms of determining property rights, some have formally registered, and some have issued certificates and registered. After the implementation of the Land Law, how to rectify all these things according to law requires convening people from all over the country engaged in land administration to discuss together. In addition, land administration is a pioneering undertaking with difficult and complex work and huge costs. At this time of national difficulty, how to coordinate the land administration funding in various provinces and cities, how to train technical personnel, and how to achieve the most effective results with the most economical methods all require detailed discussion at this land administration conference, hoping that it can be gradually implemented, so that the country and the people can benefit. The national land administration business is still in its infancy, and this National Land Administration Conference is the beginning. The mission it shoulders is extremely important, and I would like to encourage everyone together!</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Zhu Renyi)</p>
<p>"Pitiful is the moon in the boudoir, which shines especially on the Han's camp." In this war-clouded world, the so-called civilized age of the twentieth century, I wonder how many pitiful old hearts are being touched?</p>
<p>Poetry most easily evokes the same emotions in people, and moonlight most easily evokes emotional reactions. Under the moonlight of an autumn night, how many people grieve and weep? And how many more sing softly?</p>
<p>"The golden sword has been buried, heroic spirit in the weeds. The evening is cool, the sky is clear, and the moonlight is bright, I imagine the shadows of the jade pavilions and distant palaces, shining emptily on the Qinhuai River!" Li Houzhu's lines, transmitted by the moonlight, are deeply imprinted on our minds.</p>
<p>"The moon has its phases of waxing, waning, fullness, and emptiness; people have their times of sorrow, joy, separation, and reunion." However, when we are happy, we mostly do not think of the incomplete moon. When we encounter parting, seeing the full moon, we will have endless sorrows.</p>
<h3>Talking about the Moon during Mid-Autumn Festival</h3>
<p>— Qiulang</p>
<p>The delicate beauty of spring flowers and the exquisite beauty of the autumn moon are both precious things to be admired. Especially the bright moon of Mid-Autumn Festival is extraordinarily bright, crystal clear, and round, like a jade mirror and ice plate, causing people with different moods to have many feelings of sadness, sorrow, joy, and happiness. Although there are many allusions to the Mid-Autumn Festival, they always revolve around the words "moon palace." This shows that the moon has a profound impression on human beings.</p>
<p>Throughout history, there are countless beautiful lines of poetry praising the moon. Among them, the most widely circulated are Li Bai's: "When I was young, I didn't know the moon, and called it a white jade plate," and phrases dedicated to Mid-Autumn Festival such as "The moon is especially bright during Mid-Autumn Festival" and "The brightest moon of the year is tonight." These are all timeless famous lines, adding much luster to the moon.</p>
<p>Historical anecdotes, such as the Records of Searching for the Gods, record: "Houyi asked the Queen Mother of the West for the elixir of immortality, and Chang'e stole it and fled to the moon." Also, the Precious Remains of the Tianbao Era records: "Emperor Xuanzong of Tang and Celestial Master Shen visited the moon palace on the Mid-Autumn Festival." Although these are all unfounded rumors, they contain a lot of fun and inspire fantasy.</p>
<p>There are also many mysteries in the moon, such as: "The moon is made of seven treasures, and there are always 28,000 households repairing it." Also, "Wu Gang cuts down the cassia tree in the moon, and the tree closes as the axe rises." Also, "There is a jade rabbit in the moon pounding mysterious frost all year round." All these myths only win the laughter of children. In this era of the flourishing of twentieth-century science, the moon in the eyes of scientists is just one of the planets. It is more about the earth revolving around the sun, and the moon revolving around the earth. In 1920, Professor Goddard of Clark University in the United States, based on scientific research, wanted to build a rocket to shoot into the moon. In 1922, German scientist Ubisch also planned to build an aircraft using light gas and alcohol based on Goddard's plan to fly into the moon, but the result was that the costs were too high, and the project was not completed! Therefore, the secrets of the moon have not yet been accurately reported.</p>
<p>In short, this full moon of the Mid-Autumn Festival is impartially shining on the earth. People in Shanghai will naturally enjoy it, but people in disaster areas may be shedding tears while looking at it!</p>
<h3>His Busyness</h3>
<h3>Last Mid-Autumn Night</h3>
<p>— Yiqiu</p>
<p>The Mid-Autumn Festival, with its fragrant osmanthus, has gracefully arrived again, causing me to sadly recall a past event.</p>
<p>It was last year's Mid-Autumn Festival night. I had dinner at Qinmei's house. She personally cooked two of my favorite dishes, dried vegetable duck and flour-coated crabs. She also bought me a bottle of mulberry wine. Mingjiu Bu and Brother Zhong also rushed over, and we all sat down at the table and feasted. During the meal, everyone discussed what to do after dinner. Qinmei suggested seeing a famous movie at Da Guangming, Didi suggested going to the Lafayette Garden to dance, and Brother Zhong said let's play mahjong. I opposed everything and wanted to walk in the moonlight at Longhua. While everyone was arguing, Qinmei suddenly burst into laughter. Everyone looked at her and realized that there were nine people sitting at the Eight Immortals table. No wonder the lively and cheerful Qinmei couldn't close her mouth.</p>
<p>After dinner, Qinmei and Didi, my closest friends, agreed with me, and my proposal was realized - to walk in the moonlight - everyone wore the bright moon on their heads and slowly set off towards Longhua.</p>
<p>Before long, the lovely Moon Sister led us to a quiet place, under several osmanthus trees along Longhua Road. So, everyone sat on the ground. Didi took out his harmonica, and Qinmei opened her voice: "The cool breeze is like a small boat, sailing to Mid-Autumn..." A tune of "Auspicious Flowers and Full Moon" made one yearn for it. I lay comfortably on the grass, looking up at the crystal clear moon, and listening to the soft singing, which made me forget that this was the human world, and forget that this was a world of worries and pain! Ah! Qinmei and Didi's gift! Although it was only a moment of happiness and joy, it has become the most precious page in my life's history.</p>
<p>This year, alas, this unfortunate year, Qinmei has gone far away to Nanyang, to Java, more than 10,000 miles away from me. The poor Didi died of illness in Hangzhou in April of this year and has been sleeping underground forever! Alas! One living separation, one death. How will I get through this Mid-Autumn Festival night this year?</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 18: 感黨高攀逢迎斥小吏雌威大作嘈雜惱夫人</p>
<p>The more he spoke, the angrier he became, and his voice grew louder. Naturally, at this late hour, the people upstairs would also hear him. Then several people upstairs were heard loudly calling for the tea boy downstairs. Ma San heard it, walked out of the room and quickly informed his colleagues that they must not go upstairs. After calling for a while upstairs, when no tea boy came upstairs, two orderlies of the commissioner came down the stairs, shouting that if the tea boy didn't come out, they would find the treasury. Jia Duocai shouted first, and the orderlies shouted after him, which had already alarmed everyone in the hotel. They gathered in the lobby. At this late hour, the sound was even more noisy. Mrs. Lan instructed the tea boy to go down, but not only did it not quiet the environment, but it became even noisier. She frowned and said to Commissioner Lan: "This situation is too much for you to handle, isn't it? You can tolerate it, but I can't." As she spoke, she stomped her foot on the floor. Commissioner Lan? Wait for the clerk to come, and I'll question him. You don't need to be busy. Mrs. Lan said: "We have never been insulted like this in Nanjing. Do you think I will be bullied when I come to Xi'an? No way!" As she spoke, she tapped the table twice with her hand. Just then, the accountant was escorted into the room by two orderlies, standing far away and bowing. Mrs. Lan asked first, "Are you the accountant of Little Western Paradise?" The accountant replied yes. Mrs. Lan said, "You are too unqualified to run a hotel. How can a public place like this allow someone to cry here late at night? What kind of person is that traveler? It seems he is not convinced and is still scolding the tea boy downstairs. Doesn't he know he is violating public order? Go and tell him that if he is not convinced, what reason does he have to tell us. If he understands, he will pack his luggage and leave." The accountant said with a smile, "We businessmen dare not say such harsh words to the guests." Mrs. Lan shouted, "You bastard! Are we saying harsh words?" The accountant smiled faintly, "Madam! I used to be a small official and have seen all kinds of big shots. How am I a bastard?" Mrs. Lan kept slapping the table and said, "Bastard, bastard, I insist on calling you a bastard." The two orderlies saw that the madam's lips were trembling and knew that she was very angry. The accountant shouted loudly, raised his fist, and was about to punch her. The accountant saw that he couldn't beat her, turned around, and ran. (313)</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>He said that, he burst out laughing.</p>
<p>"If you love it so much, just take it with you!" He frankly gave me another special grace, so there was another royal gift for me to brag about. However, this time he rewarded me with this jade rod, not because I had done anything good to be rewarded, nor was it because he was suddenly happy to give me a reward. It was really because I had secretly used this jade rod once, and he was disgusted with it and didn't want to use it again. But no matter what, I finally got another treasure! I asked myself, when I was in the palace, whenever I saw something lovely, although I was very envious in my heart, I always tried my best to endure it and did not easily reveal it; otherwise, during my two and a half years of service, with the Empress Dowager's temperament of especially liking to give things away, and with her especially valuing me, I would have been able to get many things, and many of them would have been extremely valuable treasures, which could have allowed me to enjoy them for the rest of my life!</p>
<p>There was also something that the Empress Dowager believed could greatly enhance a woman's beauty. I think the Empress Dowager's reason for paying so much attention to her appearance was probably influenced by us female officials; because the Empress Dowager had a very bad temper all her life, that is, she especially loved to judge people by their appearance. He was so concerned about his courtiers, so naturally he paid more attention to us! So, among the eight of us, there was really no one who could be called "ugly". (413)</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Remarks</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Talks on the Mid-Autumn Festival</h3>
<p>— You Aimei</p>
<p>The moon shines ten thousand miles, it is the Mid-Autumn Festival again; recalling childhood, the family was quite prosperous. Every year on this night, the whole family rejoiced. After setting up a feast to worship Chang'e, I would stubbornly refuse to sleep, insisting on waiting for the moonlight; my late father would sometimes scold me, and I would cry out of fear. My late grandmother always doted on me, taking me into her arms, feeding me mooncakes, and sitting with me for a long time until the night was deep, the dew was cold, and I would fall asleep from exhaustion. This scene is as vivid as if it were happening right now. Now, the family is desolate, my spirits are low, and only my hard-working mother and I remain, depending on each other for survival; even when a festive season arrives, what is there to be happy about? Thinking back to the old days, I cannot help but be filled with endless emotion!</p>
<p>I also recall: "Five years ago, my late father met a woman and a daughter, and their fates were both connected to the Mid-Autumn Festival; but how long has it been since then? One is on a long journey thousands of miles away, sending only tears of regret; the other will never return from the land of the dead, it is difficult to summon the soul of a beautiful woman. Who is without feelings, who can forget this? The more I think about it, the more grief I feel. May I ask: Fairies of the Moon Palace—standing gracefully by the clouds, whose bright eyes survey the world, do they ever notice such heartbroken people and show them pity?"</p>
<p>The two previous passages are filled with sorrow, causing readers unhappiness. This is due to my own state of mind, and I cannot help but feel apologetic. Now, I will shift my pen, consult old records, and transcribe a few myths about the beautiful Moon Palace, to atone for my fault. Xuan Shi Zhi: "Zhou Sheng was a Daoist with magical skills. On the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, he said to his guests: 'I can climb the clouds and take the moon, and place it in my sleeve.' Then he took several white strips of paper, roped them together, and said: 'I will climb this ladder to take the moon.' Soon, he lifted his sleeve with his hand, and from his sleeve emerged a moon about an inch in size, with brilliant light and color, and a cold air that penetrated to the bones." Huangfu Mu's San Shui Xiao Du: "Zhao Xingzheng was a Daoist with magical skills. On Mid-Autumn Festival, there were lingering clouds. Zhi Wei said: 'One can prepare wine for killing insects and ascend Tianzhu Peak to enjoy the moon.' As soon as they left the door, the sky cleared. When they reached the peak, the moonlight was like a painting. By the time they descended the mountain, there was a bitter wind and rain, and the sky was as gloomy as before." Chuan Qi Lu: "A scholar, Wen Xiao, on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, traveled to West Mountain in Zhongling and saw a beautiful girl. She sang: 'If you can accompany me to ascend the immortal mountain, you will surely ride a colorful phoenix with Wen Xiao.' He thought she was a fairy. He stood still, unwilling to leave, and the beauty looked at him expectantly. After singing, she held a candle and led him to the summit. Suddenly, an immortal boy waited with a decree from heaven, saying: 'Wu Cailuan, for revealing celestial secrets due to personal desires, is sentenced to be a mortal's wife for twelve years.' The girl then went down the mountain with the scholar and returned to Zhongling." Ru Shu Ji: "At Goddess Peak, every year on the night of the fifteenth of August, when the moon is bright, there is the sound of silk and bamboo instruments coming from the top of the peak." As for the story of Tang Minghuang and the Daoist priest of Hongdu entering the Moon Palace and listening to the Rainbow Skirt Feather Gown Dance music, it is known to everyone, so I will not repeat it.</p>
<p>Regarding the unique natural wonders of the Mid-Autumn Festival, such as: "In Tai Ru County, on the east bank of the Ear River, there is a Water Dividing Cliff. From below the cliff, the water divides into two rivers—the South River and the North Sea. On the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, in the center of the river and the sea, a coral tree emerges from the water. Fishermen often catch it. It is said that the Sea Dragon obtained a treasure. The Buddhist scriptures say: 'Coral supporting the moon' refers to this." See Famous Sites Records. Another example: "Phoenix Mountain in Hangzhou has a stone shaped like a floating cloud, towering several feet above the ground. There is a hole on the top, about a foot in size, called the Sun-Moon Rock. Only the Mid-Autumn moon shines through the hole, while at other times it shines obliquely outside the hole." See Seven Compilations of Categories. I have never traveled to Hangzhou, and I don't know if this so-called "Sun-Moon Rock" is the same as the "Three Pools Mirroring the Moon" that is talked about today?</p>
<p>In the past, when Su Dongpo wrote a poem about the Mid-Autumn moon, there was a line: "I have heard that on this night, the moon is clear or cloudy in the same way for ten thousand miles." The annotation says: "My old friend Shi Sheng told me that he once heard a sea merchant say: 'If there is a moon on the Mid-Autumn Festival, then the pearls of that year will be numerous and round. Merchants often use this to predict.' Although they are separated by ten thousand miles, if they meet and ask each other later, the weather will be clear or cloudy in the same way." I think: The climate of the sky varies from place to place, but if what he said is true, it is indeed a strange sign!</p>
<p>My brother Chen Diexian does not like to eat mooncakes and wrote the "Scattered Notes on Crooked Eyebrows," severely criticizing them as tasteless. But I have a strong liking for them and think they are absolutely delicious. Mencius said: "The mouth has the same preferences for taste." This is simply unbelievable.</p>
<p>In the past, many beautiful lines of poetry flowed on the subject of the Mid-Autumn Festival. For example, Cao Song said: "In a cloudless world, on the fifteenth of autumn, we look together at the toad disc over the sea." Han Yu said: "This year's moon is the brightest tonight." Wang Jian said: "Late at night, everyone is allowed to sleep. Until dawn, no lamps are lit." Zhao Gu said: "One color fills a thousand miles of Mid-Autumn moon." Gu Wen Gui said: "Ten thousand miles without clouds mirror the nine provinces, the most complete and round night is like the Mid-Autumn Festival." Xu Fang said: "Jade dew on the Mid-Autumn night, golden waves open in the blue sky." Li Dong said: "On the forty-fifth autumn night, the moon is divided into a thousand miles of grandeur." Luo Yin said: "Half of the autumn light is divided on this evening." Zhao Dian said: "Autumn air evenly divides, the moon is perfectly bright." I just recalled them from memory and recorded them to grace my text.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Games to Open This Morning; Ball Games to Begin This Afternoon After Opening Ceremony; Strong Men's Track and Field in Districts 1 and 3; Women's Track and Field Competition Between Districts 2 and 3</h3>
<p>(Zhenjiang Correspondence) The Fourth Jiangsu Provincial Games are scheduled to open at 8:00 AM this morning (the 11th) at the Provincial Stadium. The president and vice presidents of the Games, Chen Guofu, Zhou Fohai, and Yu Jingtang, will all be present to give speeches. Athletes from all districts have arrived in Zhenjiang; the male athletes are staying at Zhenjiang Normal School, and the female athletes are staying at the Women's Vocational School. The command platform of the Games was completed last night, and the arrangements inside the venue were all completed by the evening. The Games officials worked hard. At 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Director Zhou of the Education Department convened a meeting with the leaders and instructors of each district. At 8:00 PM, all referees held a meeting at the Dahua Hotel. After the opening ceremony this morning, the preliminary rounds of the ball games will begin. The men's and women's track and field events will both be held in the afternoon. A general review of the strength of each district in track and field is provided below:</p>
<h3>General Review of the Strength of Each District</h3>
<p>(1) Men's Field Events</p>
<p>High Jump: Chen Tianhe from District 1 has the potential to reach 1.75 meters. He competed while ill at the district games, and his performance was poor. Zhu Mingsheng from District 2 has a respectable score. Jiang [name]chen from District 3 and Ge Chunan from District 5 both have considerable strength and are not to be underestimated. It will take some competition to determine the winner. However, the top four can break the Games record of 1.65 meters.</p>
<p>Pole Vault: Zhou Bingzheng from District 5 has the best score and may win the championship. Xu Weishi from District 3 is ambitious and unwilling to fall behind and will definitely compete with all his strength. Tan Yuzhong from [missing district] and Chu Cizhi from District 3, and Zhou Kai from District 1 all intend to score points.</p>
<p>Long Jump: Xiaolu Yaxiong of District 2 and [missing character] Hong [unclear] are likely to win the championship. However, according to athletes from that district, Wang has a cold and is scheduled to come to Zhenjiang by car on the evening of the 11th. Whether his performance will be affected depends on whether he has recovered. Zhu Zhang [unclear] from District 3 and Sun Shishan from District 5 are not weak. Wu Youcheng from District 2, Huang Chengdong from District 4, and Wang Guoliang from District 8 are also not weak. However, it will be difficult to break the record of Zhang [unclear] from the previous games.</p>
<p>Triple Jump: Wang Hong [unclear], Wang Guozhen, and Huo Jinquan from Districts 2 and 3 all have scores between 12.05 meters and will have a fierce battle to determine the winner. Wang Bingyin from District 1 and Sun Baoshan from District 5 are watching intently and also want to gain a position.</p>
<p>Shot Put: Shen Tianji from District 2 is as strong as an ox and has a score of 10.41 meters. He has been practicing diligently in recent days and continues to improve. He is sure to win the championship. Huang Zhen from District 5 is the holder of the old record and has a slightly lower score than Shen, but determination can overcome anything, and he may surprise everyone. Wang Rongji from District 3, Cao Jin [unclear] from District 8, and Wei Rongtao from District 1 all have scores on the same level and have hopes of scoring points on the record board.</p>
<p>Discus Throw: Cao Jin Tie from District 8 has an excellent score of 33.55 meters. Wei Rong [unclear], who has the old record of 28.87 meters, has also improved, but has no hope of winning the championship. Liu Yongchuan from District 2, Zhang Xi from District 2, Xu Shumo from District 4, and Zhou Hongfei from District 5 are trying to leave their names on the list.</p>
<p>Javelin Throw: Huang Liangxing from District 1 has a score of over 40 meters and is sitting pretty. Zhu Han from District 3 is guaranteed the second place. Wang Liangxing from District 1, Pan Shirong from District 4, Lei Junqian from District 5, and Zhu Qingyu from District 6 are competing for the third and fourth places.</p>
<p>(2) Men's Track Events</p>
<p>100 Meters: This year's sprint king, Cheng Jinguang, represents District 3, adding a lot of color to the Games. The championship belongs to Cheng. Ye Jie from District 2, Wu Liben from District 3, Wu Zijing from District 4, and Zeng Rongzhong from District 8 are competing for position.</p>
<p>200 Meters: This event is still Cheng Jinguang's masterpiece; how can anyone else get their hands on it? Ye Jie from District 2, Wu Liben from District 3, Wu Zijing from District 4, and Zeng Rongzhong from District 8 all have hopes of scoring points.</p>
<p>400 Meters: There is a wealth of talent in this race. The sprint king Cheng Jinguang is undoubtedly the best. Zeng Rongzhong and Li Yanxiang from District 8 are both experts from Shanghai. They represented Shanghai in the National Games two years ago. This time, they are attending the Provincial Games and will be fighting for points for their respective districts. A bloody battle is unavoidable and will be one of the most watched events by the audience.</p>
<p>800 Meters: Ge Jingde from District 2, Zhu Qiu from District 2, and Li Yanxiang from District 8 all have top scores between 2 minutes and 12-13 seconds. It is difficult to predict who will win. Based on experience, Li Yanxiang has more hope. Veteran Jin Zhongkang has worked hard and it is not difficult for him to be selected.</p>
<p>1500 Meters: Speaking of long distances, the veteran Jin Zhongkang is still going strong. He has a chance to win the championship. Wang Haofa from District 8 has a strong score and the veteran needs to be careful. Gu Zhiheng from District 3, Chuan Yuanxiang from District 4, and Yang Xigen from District 5 are eager to score points and should do their best.</p>
<p>10,000 Meters: The veteran Jin Zhongkang is very good at long-distance running. Although it is difficult to maintain the national record, he will still serve as the provincial record holder this year. His score of 16 minutes and 6 seconds has already broken his own provincial record of 37 minutes and 8.51 seconds. Wu Hanzhang from District 2 should put all his effort to compete with the veteran and give it a try.</p>
<p>High Hurdles: This year's scores are average. Zhang Ziying from District 2 has a score of 18.4 seconds, [missing character] Hanmin from District 4 has 18.6 seconds, and Chen Tianhe from District 1 has 19 seconds. Competition will be fierce. A new record may appear. Whose world it will be depends on the effort they put in at the time.</p>
<p>Middle Hurdles: Cheng Jinguang has not played this tune for a long time, and it is not yet known whether there will be any special achievements this time. However, based on Cheng's 400 meters, it is not difficult to obtain the top spot. Tao Jianping from District 3 is Cheng's strong enemy and needs to be careful.</p>
<p>Overall, due to the participation of sprint king Cheng Jinguang, District 3 has an absolute advantage.</p>
<p>(3) All-Around</p>
<p>Pentathlon: Jiang Huairen from District 2 has a score of 2,000 points and has the strongest strength. The championship should be no problem. Wang Tuanzhen from District 3 is the runner-up. Wu Taiguang from District 1, if he can cheer on the field, may have a chance to win the runner-up.</p>
<p>Decathlon: Wu Taiguang from District 1 has made rapid progress and exceeded 4,000 points at the county games. The top spot has already been determined. Pan Jiangnian from District 1 and Wu Yuqi from District 4 are competing for the runner-up. The old record holder, Wei Rongshou, injured his leg during the district games and dropped out midway. Huang Ba Shi was even eliminated. The all-around championship of District 1 is therefore hopeless.</p>
<p>Relay: District 3 has a strong force and will steadily win the 400-meter relay. District 2 is second. District 3 is dominant in the 1,600-meter relay, but District 8 has two players in the middle distance and will definitely not show weakness and will compete with all their strength.</p>
<p>(4) Women's Track and Field</p>
<p>50 Meters: Miss Changshu from District [missing number], Pang Yuanyu is elegant and can compete. Her score in the district games was 7 seconds. In the Provincial Games, she will break the national record. Chen Meixian from District 1 and Qu Meiying from District 3 can also break the provincial record and compete for the runner-up.</p>
<p>100 Meters: The top spot will still be monopolized by Pang Yuanyu. Wu Juxin and Chen Meixian from District 1, Xu Huizhen from District 3, and Jiang Zhilan from District 1 will definitely compete fiercely. I don't know who will be lucky enough to be on the scoreboard.</p>
<p>200 Meters: There is no outstanding talent in this event, which shows that Chinese women lack endurance. Only Wu Juxin from District 1 has a score of over 31 seconds. The strength of Chen Huizhen from District 3 and Jiang Yuejiao from District 4 is between 34 and 35 seconds. It is a pity that Chang Shu Pang has already participated in four events, otherwise the provincial record could be broken again.</p>
<p>80-meter Hurdles: This event is also not promising. Xu Biyun from District 2 has a score of 16.6 seconds. The championship is like taking something out of a bag. All other districts are outside 17 seconds.</p>
<p>High Jump: Miss Pang is also an expert in this field and will not give way. Although Chen Haixian from District 1 is not bad, she will ultimately let Pang take the lead. Wang Guixiang, a woman from Danyang, has great ambition and wants to snatch the runner-up.</p>
<p>Long Jump: Miss Pang's masterpiece will definitely be extraordinary. She broke the national record in the district games, and may make further progress in the Provincial Games. This is one of the most exciting scenes of the Games. At 3:30 PM on the 11th, the audience will be fascinated by this event. More reports will be published in the newspapers then.</p>
<p>Shot Put: Shao Weirong from District 1, Feng Yuzhen from District 2, and Sun Defang from District 8 have scores between 8 meters. It is not difficult to break the provincial record. Who will win the championship depends on their individual efforts.</p>
<p>Discus Throw: Feng Yuzhen from District 3 has a score of 24.86 meters, not far from the national record. Who dares to compete with her? However, Shao Weirong and Sun Defang from District 8 must compete for the runner-up.</p>
<p>Softball Throw: Wang Guiqing's district record in District 1 is 45.50 meters, 58 points away from the national record. She is undoubtedly invincible in the Provincial Games. It is hoped that she can break the national record. The scores of Districts 2 and 3 are only over 40 meters. It is not known who will win the runner-up.</p>
<p>Javelin Throw: Sun Defang from District 8 has a score of 24 meters and the championship is no problem. Shi Guiqing from District 1 and Zhou Qikun from District 3 are competing for the runner-up.</p>
<p>400-meter Relay: The women's track and field championship depends on the battle between the women's army of Districts 1 and 3. District 2 has average talent, and District 3 has fewer soldiers but more capable generals. Who will win the championship depends on the result of the relay. Therefore, this event is not only a competition between Districts 1 and 3, but District 1 is also watching from the sidelines.</p>

<h3>This City Participates in the National Games Women's Tennis Preliminary Round Yesterday, Su Jianhua and Huang Zhifang's Performance was More Exciting, Yan Jingwei and He Zuohui Both Obtained Rights to the Second Round</h3>
<p>The city participated in the National Games women's tennis selection, held at 2:00 PM yesterday at the China Tennis Association. The selection committee chairman Zhang Ziling arrived to preside over the event. A total of four groups of singles matches were held, and as a result, Su Jianhua, Yan Jingwei, He Zuohui, Huang Zhifang and others obtained the right to the second round. The second round is scheduled to be held at 1:00 PM on the 14th of this month at the China Tennis Association. The results of yesterday's competition are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Su Jianhua Wins Against Wang Shikun</p>
<p>Ms. Su Jianhua, who represented Fujian Province in women's tennis at the previous National Games, returned to Shanghai and is now studying at Datong University. She took to the court at 2:00 PM yesterday to compete against Wang Shikun. After all, she has been fighting on the court for a long time, is experienced, and not in a hurry. Both long-range and close-range attacks are commendable. She quickly took two games at the start, but Wang was not weak either, often unexpectedly attacking Su's vital points. In the blink of an eye, she won back two games. At this point, the performance of both sides gradually became exciting. After 3-3, Su became more spirited and won three consecutive games. The first set was won 6-3. In the first set, Wang Nan's spirit was not weak, but she made many mistakes, while Su became more and more successful in the battle, and finally won again with 6-1.</p>
<p>Yan Jingwei Wins Against Chen Aizhen</p>
<p>The battle between Yan and Chen also started at the same time at 2:00 PM. Both of them were rather weak, and there were few exciting moments in the battle. Yan won often in serving because of her tall stature, but her posture was quite unnatural and her movements were relatively sluggish. If she can practice more and take advantage of her height and strength, she is also a good talent. Although Chen was more lively, her strength was inferior, resulting in her inability to win. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Huang Zhifang Wins Against Lu Meiyun</p>
<p>Miss Huang is the women's tennis representative from this city to attend the National Games. Her tennis skills are comparable to those of Su Jianhua. The two study at Datong University together and often learn from each other, making great progress. Her serve is extremely sharp, and her baseline shots are also quite skillful. Miss Lu came to Shanghai from Nanyang recently. Her shots are very powerful and her posture is also natural and admirable. Unfortunately, she had less practice, and had no control over the ball, resulting in Miss Huang winning both sets easily.</p>
<p>He Zuohui Wins Against Chen Meibo</p>
<p>The competition between He Zuohui and Chen Meibo also started at 3:00 PM at the same time as Huang and Lu. The two players' tennis skills were comparable, and it was difficult to tell who would win. Little Chen's serve was sharp and her movements were lively. At first, she had a good chance of winning, but she was defeated by Miss He's intelligence. She was defeated twice and her strength gradually became insufficient. He Zuohui won both games 6-3.</p>
<p>The Second Round Order Has Been Set</p>
<p>The second round is scheduled to be held at the China Tennis Association starting at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 14th. Famous players such as the Wei sisters who have just returned from Australia, as well as Mrs. Lin Baohua, Ms. Liang Peiyu, and Mao Yuwen, the city's women's tennis representative at the previous National Games, will all be on the court to compete. Judging from yesterday's momentum, Yan Jingwei and He Zuohui have less hope, while Yan Su Jianhua and Huang Zhifang will do their best to respond to the Wei sisters. There will definitely be a fierce battle at that time. The order is as follows:</p>
<p>Hua vs. Wei Maigu (2:00 PM)</p>
<p>Yan Jingwei vs. Liang Peiyu (2:00 PM)</p>
<p>Huang Zhifang vs. Wei Zutong (3:00 PM)</p>
<p>He Zuohui vs. Mao Yuwen (3:00 PM)</p>
<h3>Wang Wenzheng vs. Lin Baohua Advanced Singles Second Round Starting at 2:30 PM This Afternoon at the French Chamber of Commerce on Avenue Joffre</h3>
<p>The advanced singles of the Shangzhang Gedi Tennis Club is scheduled for the second round this afternoon. There are two groups, starting at 1:30 PM at the French Chamber of Commerce court. Wang Wenzheng has a good chance of winning against Lin Baohua. Wang was last year's hard court singles champion, defeating Carlson in the final. He still has great hope this year. The order for today is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Lin Baohua vs. Wang Wenzheng Starting at 2:30 PM</p>
<p>(2) Defu vs. Carlson Starting at 4:00 PM Enter and exit from Avenue Joffre. Tickets are one yuan per person.</p>

<h3>Current Status of Jiangsu Province Education Funds The August Funds Have Been Issued Recently, Study Abroad Funds and Temporary Funds Have Been Issued Teacher Retirement Pension Has Been Implemented</h3>
<p>In the past two or three years, the Jiangsu education system, the provincial government and education administrative authorities have worked hard to plan for fees, issuing them monthly. They have improved the salaries of teachers and staff, selected outstanding talents, and sent them to study abroad for research, providing opportunities for further study. They have also implemented a teacher retirement pension system, which not only respects teachers but also inspires action. In the past two years, Jiangsu education funds have spent 9,000 yuan annually on teacher retirement pensions, approximately 800 yuan per month. It can be seen that the Jiangsu education administrative authorities treat teachers and staff with courtesy, which is commendable. It is also heard that in the 23rd year, the months of payment for middle schools, normal schools, vocational schools, and social education institutions in Jiangsu province were half a month different, and there was a one-month difference with rural teachers and primary schools. Since the 24th year, all types of schools and institutions have been completely unified. Recently, on September 9, the full amount of funds for all types of schools and social education institutions in Jiangsu province for August was cleared. The study abroad funds for Europe and the United States are issued every three months. The funds for July, August and September of this autumn have been remitted. On the afternoon of September 10, the Jiangsu Education Fund Auditors Committee held a meeting, and the teacher retirement pensions and temporary fees for various schools that should be issued this year have been signed by the auditors and will be issued soon.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Education Orders the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education to Handle Private Medical, Legal, and Political Specialized Schools</h3>
<p>Based on inspection reports, the Ministry of Education issued an order to the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education on the 10th of this month. The original order stated: "The Ministry previously sent personnel to inspect private medical, legal and political, art, fine arts, physical education, and other specialized and vocational schools in Sichuan Province. Based on the reports, after detailed review, the handling of these schools does not comply with the regulations, and they should be reorganized or closed. Specific suggestions are presented as follows: (1) The Private Southwest Fine Arts Vocational School has financial difficulties, simple equipment, few vocational students, and many unqualified admissions. In addition, there is a lack of excellent teachers. It is difficult to approve the continuation of vocational education. However, the school's assets and school buildings have a basic foundation and can be used. An order should be issued to cancel the name of the vocational school, raise funds, and reorganize a practical fine arts vocational school (such as design, decoration, and plate making) to strive for development in applied fields. (2) The Private Sichuan Art Vocational School has been in operation for a long time and has some equipment, but it has financial difficulties, a lack of teachers, and many unqualified student admissions. In addition, management is lax, and even student records are missing. Based on a comprehensive review of the school's handling, the physical education department should be closed, and the name of the vocational school should be cancelled and changed to an art training center or value training center, enrolling students for free study. (3) The Private Sichuan Medical Specialized School requested the Ministry to register in the 22nd year. The director of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education and the president of Sichuan University were ordered to inspect it. According to the report, key points should be revised and ordered to be followed. It has not been reported yet. In the 23rd year, it was reported that it had been changed to a military medical school, but it was not approved. According to the report, the school has no funding, simple equipment, and lacks responsible full-time personnel in both administration and teaching. It is very unsuitable and should be ordered to close immediately. The original school buildings were transferred from the Army Medical School and are public property. They should be taken over by the department for use in running other schools. (4) The Private Chongqing Law and Politics Specialized School is actually a middle school and an old-style law and politics specialized school. The Ministry had already ordered it to close, and all provinces have complied. The school should be ordered to close immediately, and the original 6,000 yuan in provincial subsidies should be transferred to subsidize other schools. (5) The Private Chongqing Art Vocational School, the Private Oriental Fine Arts Vocational School, the Private Minben Physical Education Vocational School, and the Private Xingqun Physical Education Vocational School all have management situations that do not comply with the regulations, lack funding, and have empty equipment, and do not have the scale of a school. An order should be issued to close them all. The department should be ordered to separately transfer the order to be followed."</p>

<h3>Recent Instructions from the National Academy of Music</h3>
<p>The National Academy of Music has been relocated to the new campus on Nanjing Road in the city center since July of this year, and it has been more than a month so far. In order to facilitate the fact that the school buildings have not been completely completed, the Ministry of Education has approved the postponement of the start of this semester to October 15.

The east practice room and dormitory cannot be built for the time being. Now, on the one hand, houses are rented on Minxian Road as dormitories for teachers and students, and on the other hand, the government is requested to quickly allocate temporary funds and conduct fundraising in order to complete the construction plan as soon as possible, so as to establish the foundation of music education in our country.</p>
<h3>Little Man (4)(3)</h3>
<p>— Original by Ms. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang (Zonghai)</p>
<p>When Ned heard this, his face also showed surprise. He said, "I thought you liked poor children to come and live with you and would treat them well, just like you treat me."</p>
<p>"That's true, but I would also like to know what kind of people they are first. I have to pick and choose a little, because there are too many poor children in the world. My place is not enough to accommodate them all. If I could, wouldn't that be great?"</p>
<p>"I called him here because I thought you would like him too, but if he doesn't have a place, he can go back," Ned said sadly.</p>
<p>The child's faith in her kindness to the orphaned and poor moved Mrs. Pei. She couldn't bear to disappoint him or break his kind little plan, so she said:</p>
<p>"Tell me, what kind of person is this Donn?"</p>
<p>"I don't know anything, except that he has no relatives and is poor and treats me very well, so I am willing to do my best to treat him well."</p>
<p>"Every one of those is a very good reason; however, Ned, the house is really full, and I don't know where to put him," said Mrs. Pei, but she was gradually inclined to prove that she was indeed the shelter for the poor that he thought she was.</p>
<p>"He can sleep in my bed, and I can go to sleep in the barn. It's not cold there, and I don't care; I used to sleep anywhere with my father," Ned said with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Mid-Autumn Mooncakes are a small item, but without great learning, great insight, and great ability, one cannot stand in a superior position. One day, I visited Guanshengyuan and interviewed Mr. Xi Guansheng for a chat. Mr. Xi talked eloquently about the way of mooncakes with great interest. Mr. Xi said: Making mooncakes is not difficult, the difficulty lies in suiting the taste of customers; selling mooncakes is not difficult, the difficulty lies in doing it just right. Guanshengyuan must concentrate all its attention on mooncake work ten days before the Mid-Autumn Festival. Designers, manufacturers, investigators, material purchasers, distributors, and sellers unite and respond to each other, keeping in close contact. Which kind sells well, which kind sells poorly, which kind should be made more of, and which kind should be made less of, too much is wasteful, and too little is not enough; in short, supply and demand should be corresponding, and just right. Thinking about the study of mooncakes is more than half the battle. Although Mr. Xi's words are about mooncakes, in fact, isn't that the case for all national goods?</p>
<p>Everyone thinks that the rubber industry is impossible to operate. But the rubber industry is not just overshoes. A large amount of demand lies in tires. Mr. Xue Fuzhi and Mr. Wu Zhesheng of the Great China Rubber Factory were able to see this point, worked hard to open up new paths, and exclusively manufactured tires for cars, chartered cars, and bicycles. Looking at the products, they surpass imported goods and are happily used on roads all over the country. It can be seen that there is no good or bad business, it depends on how people do it.</p>
<p>The new way out for the national goods industry should not forget South Seas trade. The other day, Mr. Liu Shimu mentioned that the Japanese pay attention to South Seas trade, penetrating every aspect, without paying attention to the slightest detail, regarding the South Seas as Japan's lifeline, and dealing with it with all their strength. Looking back at our country's industry and commerce, they are short-sighted, only caring about the present, falling behind in everything, and failing in every aspect, which is a cause for great sorrow. It is deeply hoped that people in the national goods industry with vision and insight will broaden their horizons in the future. Expand the region so that foreign trade is not controlled by foreigners, so that a glimmer of hope for the national goods industry will not be extinguished. These words are heartfelt, and our national goods industry should never forget them.</p>
<p>Mr. Liang Bozhi of the Guangming Thermos Bottle Factory, in addition to working hard to promote the sale of his products, pays special attention to the training of store clerks and salesmen, extensively extending his career, and earnestly training them. Mr. Liang said: Sales work is half due to the goods and half due to the sales talent. He also encourages salesmen to make up for their knowledge and gives them scholarships to encourage them. This kind of intention is especially admirable. I know that Mr. Liang, based on this purpose, will work hard to implement it, and the achievements he will achieve in the future are limited.</p>
<h3>National Goods and the "Mid-Autumn Festival"</h3>
<p>— Xiao Bai</p>
<p>The seasons pass like flying, and today is again the traditional Mid-Autumn Festival. Chinese people can never forget the old ways. We only need to see the crowds of people buying festival goods in major stores and companies in recent days, and the busy exchange of gifts in every family, to see that everyone is fully preparing for the festival, there is no doubt about this.</p>
<p>However, here, I want to think, like someone with a nervous disposition, and this is also a fact. I fear that under the common worship of foreign goods in the hearts of Chinese people, the arrival of each festival is precisely giving foreign goods a good opportunity to be dumped. Therefore, at this time, I am deeply afraid that the consumption during this one festival will send away a lot of good money: while the giant merchants and wealthy magnates of the East and West will be laughing up their sleeves.</p>
<p>Originally, in the minds of Chinese people, the Dragon Boat Festival, the New Year, and the Mid-Autumn Festival are the three most important festivals of the year: often many families are usually very frugal, but when the festival comes, they have to indulge in extravagance, inviting guests! Family banquets! Having a big meal, and also giving gifts, has become an unbreakable habit. And in this eating and giving, are we not often acting as "foreign goods promoters"? Like foreign wines and spirits! Imported candies, biscuits, canned foods! In our memory, aren't they all at their peak sales precisely during these festivals? Therefore, today, I want to solemnly put forward two hopes to everyone: the first is that everyone should strive to promote domestic goods as gifts, and no longer give foreign goods to others, so as not to be despised by others and also insult them. We are Chinese people, how can we use foreign goods for reciprocal gift-giving! The second is that everyone should strive to promote domestic food and beverages. Whether it is for festival banquets or inviting guests, please do not use imported goods again. While indulging in the pleasures of the palate, do not become confused manufacturers of huge trade deficits, and culprits of national ruin and family destruction. This is my most sincere prayer.</p>
<p>Looking at the moon hanging high in the sky, bright and lovely, I hope that today everyone will love the moon with their hearts, and love the exquisite domestic goods even more. Moreover, today, everyone can also think about it, the "Student National Goods Year" has also arrived in autumn. The wheels of time have almost crushed two-thirds of its days: we must examine ourselves and see whether we have worked hard in the past eight months for the national goods movement, and whether the effectiveness of promoting national goods has been achieved. I think this is very meaningful.</p>
<p>Tonight's moonlight is the brightest possible, but I hope even more that this year our achievements in promoting national goods will become the most brilliant page in the history of national goods.</p>
<h3>Gift-Giving and National Goods</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>The sound of cicadas in the parasol trees is gradually bidding farewell to people. The leaves on the branches are also gradually changing from green to withered yellow. The weather tells us, "It is already the season of autumn." When this new autumn arrives, the busiest thing for most people, besides preparing autumn clothes and articles, is probably preparing Mid-Autumn gifts, which is also a very troublesome matter.</p>
<p>Gift-giving is originally a legitimate social interaction between people. We have nothing to object to the issue of gift-giving itself; however, what we consider to be of value for discussion and necessary for research is the substantive issue of gift-giving. In other words: what kind of things should we give to friends and relatives, and what kind of things should we choose to give? That is reasonable and proper. This is a question that should be noted before giving gifts.</p>
<p>Now, the time for Mid-Autumn Festival gift-giving has arrived, and many people are preparing to give gifts. The advertisements in newspapers and the flags in the streets and alleys are all decorated with the words "Autumn Big Sale" and "Mid-Autumn Festival Gift-Giving."</p>
<p>However, how should we deal with Mid-Autumn Festival gift-giving? In my opinion, both the gift-giver and the recipient must pay attention to the following two principles:</p>
<p>(A) Giving gifts of national goods - This matter of giving gifts, on the surface, seems to be a personal matter, but upon careful thought, it has a great relationship with the national economy and people's livelihood, and the future of the nation. At a time when the social economy is very tight and domestic industry and commerce are so depressed, we must regard national goods as the standard for giving gifts. For example, for Mid-Autumn Festival gifts, in terms of food, we should give mooncakes from Guan Niu Yuan Tai Kang… companies; in terms of gifts, we should give gift certificates from the China National Goods Company, or gift certificates from the Sanyu Industrial Society, etc. Such gift-giving, on the one hand, is promoting national goods, opening up a lifeline for the endangered national goods industry, and at the same time, it can also greatly show that the gift-giver is a patriotic compatriot.</p>
<p>(B) Accepting gifts of national goods - The meaning of giving gifts is, on the one hand, to give gifts to relatives and friends, and at the same time, from the perspective of the recipient, it is to accept the sincerity of others, and to accept things from relatives and friends. Therefore, while the gift-giver should take national goods as the standard for giving gifts, the recipient should also pay attention at all times to whether the things sent are national goods. In my opinion, we can gratefully accept gifts of national goods, and we should adopt an attitude of thanking but refusing gifts of non-national goods. (Note: when refusing gifts, you should explain the reason for the refusal so that the gift-giver knows the reason for the refusal. In this way, the next time they give gifts, they will definitely abandon foreign goods and purchase national goods.) If everyone can do this, if everyone can adopt this straightforward attitude, I believe that the effect will definitely be very great.</p>
<p>In short, Mid-Autumn Festival is a time for giving gifts. I hope that everyone will use more national goods, purchase national goods, and create an active posture for the endangered national goods industry; then, this Mid-Autumn Festival may not be a time when the future of national goods turns for the better.</p>
<h3>A Word of Advice</h3>
<p>— Tu Hongxia</p>
<p>Nowadays, some young people only know to buy things that are pretty and beautiful, and absolutely do not care whether they are domestic or foreign goods?</p>
<p>People who buy foreign goods will sooner or later be subject to the condemnation of their conscience. The condemnation of conscience is permanent, and it is a condemnation of the spirit of man. Compared to the temporary punishment of man's body by the law, its pain is increased a hundredfold.</p>
<p>For a person who buys a foreign good and can immediately discover his conscience, and a person who never repents, or repents incompletely, we can simply criticize them with a sentence: "The former is a gentleman who knows shame, the latter is a villain who does not know shame."</p>
<p>People in the countryside do not know that there are foreign goods, and people in the cities do not know that there are Chinese goods; so when it comes to patriotism, people in the countryside are more sincere!</p>
<p>The more remote the place, the fewer the foreign goods; conversely, the more prosperous the place, the more foreign goods there are. On the surface, it seems that the convenience and blockage of transportation are related to the abundance or lack of foreign goods? Actually not. Because in prosperous places, people's "vanity is too great," so the sales of foreign goods are extensive. In the end, it is still "vanity that harms people."</p>
<h3>Hoping for Chinese Silk Factories After Reading "Cloth Painting"</h3>
<p>— Meng Zhao</p>
<p>My old friend Fan Yanqiao wrote an article entitled "Cloth Painting" in the newspaper. He said: Sixty or seventy years ago, there was a painter in Suzhou who tried to paint on foreign cloth and succeeded. He quoted Ye Diaosheng's "Oubei Fisher's Talk," saying: "I occasionally asked Yan Ruru to paint ink landscapes on a very fine foreign cloth. Ruru said that its texture is slightly harder than silk, and more harmonious and moist than rice paper. It can bring out the interest of brush and ink, and the charm is more mellow and elegant. Everyone thinks it is novel and delightful." In the end, my old friend Mr. Du He said: "If it is possible to paint on cloth, it is best to use Chinese cloth, otherwise it is like writing with foreign paper, which is just another source of leakage." Mr. Du He's words are very true, and aroused my motivation to write this article.</p>
<p>I think that "cloth painting" should of course use Chinese cloth, but now the price of silk is also extremely cheap. Domestic goods factories such as Maya and others may also contact famous Chinese and Western painters, and plan the size and dimensions of the canvas, using silk gauze interwoven, and strive to be smooth and easy to write on, and able to be preserved for hundreds of years without damage! Whether it is oil painting or landscape painting, it must be much better than rice paper, etc. Famous paintings and famous fabrics complement each other, just like icing on the cake! Not only will it sell well in China, but the success of exhibitions and promotions abroad can be guaranteed! And for domestic goods fabrics, with one more outlet, should the authorities of Chinese silk factories be easily roused?</p>
<h3>Several Key Points for Promoting National Goods in the Countryside</h3>
<p>— Lu Shu'ang</p>
<p>Some people say: There is no need to loudly advocate the promotion of national goods in the countryside, because the peasants wear homespun cloth, eat self-grown rice and wheat, and live in self-built thatched huts; they can't enjoy foreign perfumes and powders, they can't dream of European and American bright silks and satins, and they don't hope for foreign delicacies; what they wear, eat, and live in are all domestic goods, so there is no need for us to promote them again. These few words are all in line with the facts, but in my opinion, the footprints of foreign goods cannot be said to be absent in the countryside, but they are relatively few. If the foreign yarn, foreign thread, foreign oil, foreign nails, foreign pine, foreign matches, etc., that they often shout about, are already quite a sight. I will now talk about the few more important and noteworthy points.</p>
<p>The first is cotton yarn. Farmers' understanding of cotton yarn, whether domestic or foreign, is collectively called foreign yarn. The sales of cotton yarn are extremely wide in the countryside, because among rural women, no one does not engage in weaving during the slack season, although there are still those who spin cotton yarn themselves, but they account for a small minority of uses, because it takes too much time. Farmers rarely pay attention to whether the cotton yarn they buy is domestic. The failure of domestic cotton yarn to sell well is a major reason. The yarn packages of each factory originally have beautiful trademarks. If the national yarn factories can unite and print these trademarks in the form of monthly calendars, all the domestic cotton yarn, its name, count, and trademark style, are listed, and distributed to the inland, so that the villagers can know at a glance that a certain yarn from a certain factory is domestic, and intellectuals also have a basis for guidance from the side. This kind of method costs little and has great effect. According to the current situation, not only can the villagers not distinguish whether it is domestic or foreign, but even those who are enthusiastic about promoting it have no basis to rely on.</p>
<p>The second is fertilizer. The fertilizers used by farmers have always been nothing more than grass fertilizer, animal fertilizer, human manure, bean cake, and vegetable cake. Since the advent of artificial fertilizers, the villagers have competed to use them for their convenience and low price. Alas! Ignorant villagers only know the present, how can they care about the future? The countryside has been ruined to this point. If we add the invasion of huge foreign fertilizers, how can the harm be imagined? Therefore, for the fertilizer problem, which is of great importance, on the one hand, we hope that agricultural experts will conduct in-depth research and improve the fertilizer that farmers need most, and on the other hand, we hope that comrades who are responsible for guiding farmers will thoroughly explain the advantages and disadvantages, and do not underestimate the fertilizers inherent in our country, and it is even more inappropriate to be greedy for a small number of cheap things for a while, and be tempted by their interests, and promote them.</p>
<p>The third is building materials. Rural houses are not as tall as those in the city, and they are all bungalows. Our country's inherent timber is enough for application. To guide the villagers to pay attention to this point, we should start from schools and institutions. However, if we look at the various buildings in the interior now, most of them are not domestic materials, and the loss is incalculable. I am deeply saddened by this, so I want to build a house that costs around a thousand dollars. Except that everyone thinks there is no way and uses three foreign materials! I dare not deny that the loss has already been more than twenty dollars! The rest are completely domestic. Everyone still pays little attention to this issue, so I specifically express it. In particular, I hope that the educational comrades who shout every day about promoting national goods and are enthusiastic about loving the country will come to lead the farmers and set a good example.</p>
<p>The fourth is cigarettes. I always say this to the farmers, smoking is harmful, if you have to smoke, you should use the old Chinese style water pipes and dry tobacco. However, the fact is not so. In a small town, the sales of cigarettes amount to several hundred boxes a day. Whether talking, working, or walking, many people often smoke cigarettes, and they don't think it is strange. And if you examine the cigarettes they smoke, most of them are foreign goods. Not only is this true in the laboring class, but many intellectuals also like to smoke foreign cigarettes. I do not advocate smoking cigarettes, but since the fact is not easy to discourage, I only hope that people who smoke will, at least to a limited extent, smoke Chinese cigarettes. I will inevitably be criticized for holding this view, but it is just a matter of fact. The purpose is to sell more domestic goods and keep more vitality for the country.</p>
<p>I live with the farmers every day, and what I see and hear is relatively accurate, so I put forward the above four questions for those who are enthusiastic about promoting domestic goods to use as a reference. If it can attract everyone's attention, on the one hand, promote it, and on the other hand, improve it, the sales of domestic goods will definitely be greatly affected. Moreover, it can also be clearly understood that the promotion of domestic goods should not only focus on the city. The vast countryside is probably more important than the city. In the future, if we can hold more domestic goods roaming exhibitions in the inland, we will surely awaken the enthusiasm of the majority of the people to love and use domestic goods, so as to achieve the greatest purpose of promoting domestic goods.</p>

Indian silver was predicted to continue rising, and banks continued to sell without hesitation. As a result, it continued to fall. Trading was even flatter in the morning, and the market situation was unusually boring. In the early morning, overseas silver markets in both the UK and the US were flat, and the forward silver price of Monterrey rose by between 3 and 4.5 basis points. The exchange rate had already rebounded, and London's raw gold fell by 6.5 pence, but sentiment was difficult to recover. Outside the market, the prepared transaction opened and retreated to 86 yuan.

It was pre-known that the HSBC exchange rate would be posted, the UK was flat and the US rose by 0.0625. After the high, it turned the disk. However, as banks were doing quite well against each other, Sassoon also scaled back, and the domestic disk seemed tight and easy to pull up. After that, the foreign exchange market was mediocre, and there was a lack of large amounts of supply and demand in the market, resulting in a sluggish market situation for a long time. The ups and downs were limited, and the situation was calm. Later, the banks' appetites tended to be blocked, gradually becoming unsustainable. Foreign telegrams said that Italy had issued a mobilization order and refused the UK to participate in mediation, and sentiment was slightly tired and fell, but large households saw the low and maintained it, and there was still the same rise. When it was predicted that Indian silver would rise by 8 annas, the foreign exchange market became even harder, and the selling pressure was also strong, and it finally fell again. After closing, it was slightly stable. Due to the Autumn Festival, there was not much activity in the market. The predicted forward premium was about 4 yuan or so for the short side.

The current term rate will be held on Saturday, and the short side is predicted to post about 4 yuan. There are only 7 slips left for this month, and the short side is Tong Tai Chang and the long side is Shen Feng.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was extremely flat. In summary, Yi Feng Yong Yong Li Yong Feng Da Da Ying Feng Heng Fu Yu Heng Chang Yong Fu Xing Yong Yu Qing Yong Yuan Chang Yong Chun Yuan Yong Yong Feng Fu Tai Yong, etc. were on the buying side.

<h3>Sentiment is Slightly Weaker, Foreign Exchange Continues to Harden</h3>
<p>According to foreign telegrams yesterday, London's large strips were flat in both the near and far terms, and the New York silver market did not change either. The forward silver price of the De Li rose by between 3 and 4.5 basis points. London's raw gold disc was 6.5 pence, the pound against the dollar rose 200, the pound against the franc rose 3 pounds, the dollar against the pound rose 625, and the dollar against the franc shrank 25.

Compared to the previous closing, the British was 0.0625 weaker and the US was 125 harder. The Central Bank's licensing revealed that both the UK and the US were flat, and the customs gold unit fell by 7 basis points. Although the psychological state of the industry and commerce was tired, the banks took the opportunity to do against each other cheaply, and the demand side was relatively strong, and it was peaceful after the opening. Sassoon's scaling back once tightened, and it was known in advance that the HSBC exchange rate would be posted, the UK was flat and the US rose by 0.0625, and the trend circled. After that, sentiment was calm, and the banks' appetites were also greatly blocked, resulting in a lack of change and a very necessary detour. After that, foreign telegrams said that Italy had issued a mobilization order and refused the UK to participate in the dissolution committee, and sentiment was slightly tired and lacked maintenance. The banks were selling again, and the prediction of Bombay's long eight annas made the process step hard. Traffic still came to block the exit, so it was difficult to recover. At noon closing, the recent selling price was 1 shilling 6 pence 1875 for the British exchange rate and 37 yuan 4375 for the US exchange rate. Compared to the previous closing, the British was 0.0625 weaker and the US was 1875 harder. Chinese merchants scaled back the plug unevenly, and their appetites were ordinary.

<h3>Lower Exchange Rate for Foreign Silver, High Price for Copper Coins</h3>
<p>The Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching, and the incoming and outgoing commercial accounts are usually trivial and complicated. However, due to the poor market this year and weak purchasing power, all kinds of accounts have decreased sharply. Furthermore, collecting outstanding debts has been particularly difficult, resulting in an exceptionally sluggish situation. Money exchange businesses feel that their handling of settlements during this festival will be far inferior to previous years. The exchange rate for foreign silver in the early market still shows no vitality. Yesterday, the market price went down instead, decreasing by a small fraction compared to the previous day, calculated at one dime and four cents. Silver dollars with added mercury have no market price at all and are all marked down to zero. Transactions in exchange tickets have also decreased recently. Yesterday, the morning market transfer was only over 2.3 million, with new transactions over 400,000. The afternoon market transactions were only over 100,000, and transactions in small associations were over 900,000. Foreign silver collateral transactions were over 200,000 for redemption and over 100,000 for new transactions. The small amount of business is unprecedented, which shows the scarcity of market inflows and outflows. The amount of banknotes received was over 1.4 million, and the amount issued was over 1.2 million, with few secretly marked notes and mostly circulating notes.

<h3>Securities: Public Bonds Slightly Settle Futures Transactions in the Afternoon Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock exchange was particularly deserted due to the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday. The sluggishness of both buyers and sellers meant that transactions were rare. Even when there were transactions of 30,000 to 50,000, there were often no counterparties, so the market became even more stagnant. The number of people gathered in the market also decreased significantly, and the market atmosphere was cold and dull, which was unprecedented. If this stalemate continues repeatedly, the coming changes will be even more severe. The afternoon market was relatively lively with slight settlements and futures transactions, but they were also done opportunistically, as the term was still sufficient, so there was no urgency. Morning transactions were extremely quiet, with very few listed prices. The market price still fluctuated between five cents and one dime, with buyers finding an increase of five cents too expensive and sellers finding a decrease of five cents too cheap, resulting in mutual rejection and increased stagnation. If more than one hour passes, it is not easy to make any movement. To expand the situation, there must be new transactions or large-scale futures trading. The market results were slightly stronger, mostly slightly better by five cents, one dime, or two dimes. The total number of completed transactions was 3,265,000 yuan. The results of the increases and decreases are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>U.S. Industrial Stocks Reach New High Prices</h3>
<p>According to a report from Xin Feng Foreign Firm, yesterday (the 10th), the New York stock market continued to advance under the leadership of Chrysler Motors, with industrial stocks rising to their highest peak since 1931. Railway stocks have approached their highest peak this year, utility stocks are still flat, and the bond market is firm. Small exchange stocks rose, and the total volume for the day was 1.98 million shares.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Prices Suddenly Soften This Month</h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending flat, and the situation is becoming increasingly mediocre. The environment has not improved significantly, and it is still difficult to generate much interest. Fortunately, the sales of spot yarn have been prosperous recently, which supports the market. As for this month, Changfeng has released more stock, making the market particularly weak. It is said that 1,000 pieces of 17-count yarn have already been released into the warehouse.</p>
<p>Difficult for Jin Nan Changfeng to Dump</p>
<p>The opening of the bidding for yarn futures saw a sudden weakness this month due to the exclusive selling by Changfeng and Gengfeng. It is said that 17-count yarn will be delivered, so the firm September contract suddenly softened. However, bidding for distant months was slightly tighter, as the recent increase in spot yarn sales has inclined some people to go long, rising 4.5 dimes. Then, in the second and third rounds, the weak short-term contracts pulled the distant months down. As a result, the current month fell 7 dimes compared to the previous day's closing price, and the distant months fell 4 dimes. The opening in the afternoon was still firm and expensive. It was heard that the spot yarn transaction in the morning was about 1,000 bales. According to Japanese sources, Qingdao prices are falling, and the yarn inventory there is heavy, so Japanese merchants are bearish. As a result, it was nearly flat, and the distant months fell 2.3 dimes. Sold: Tongfu 400 bales, Jinchang 350 bales, Gengfeng 1,200 bales, Senkang 300 bales, Tonghe 300 bales, Xincheng 1,150 bales, Dafu 400 bales, Tongji 500 bales, Yichang 750 bales, Changfeng 600 bales. Bought: Ruidai 1,350 bales, Tongfeng 450 bales, Shenji 900 bales, Renfeng 650 bales, Yichang 450 bales, Dafeng 550 bales, Daji 350 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Are Smooth</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are good. It is estimated that all parties bought a total of 1,225 bales throughout the day. The market is similar to the previous day. The buying volume of each party is as follows:</p>
<p>Henan 153, Inland 190, Changsha 155, Guangdong 95</p>
<p>Datong 5, Wuhu 10, Yunnan 405, Peers 2</p>
<p>Nanjing 5, Xuzhou 30, Shantou 15, Tianjin 100</p>
<p>Jiangxi 60</p>
<h3>New Cotton Appears on the Market, Bidding for Cotton is Weak</h3>
<p>The cotton market initially rose and then fell, with the trend still strong. Due to the reduced output of U.S. cotton and the rise in market prices, and the fierce rise in Indian cotton, many parties remained still. In the afternoon, it was heard that new cotton from all regions was on the market, with a surge in daily shipments. Factories that were shut down still have no news of reopening. Due to the lack of consumption, the market situation turned weak.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Market Turns Soft in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The opening of the bidding for cotton futures saw a consistent rise across all months, with family names in demand. As U.S. cotton continued to rise by ten pounds and Indian cotton rose even more fiercely, many parties were even more bullish. All months rose by 1.5 to 2 dimes. In the third closing round, as the yarn market turned flat and weak again, it fell back by 5 cents to 1 dime. As a result, all months rose by 5 cents to 1.5 dimes compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon opening, the market turned weak. It was heard that new cotton from all parties was entering the market one after another, and factory purchases were not strong. Japanese merchants also dumped, and the market was more sluggish. As a result, all months fell by 5 cents to 2 dimes compared to the morning closing price. Sold: Tongji 1,000 dan, Jinchang 1,300 dan, Zhenda 1,800 dan, Hexing 1,100 dan, Changfeng 1,700 dan, Hengchang 700 dan, Yongda 700 dan, Yikang 2,600 dan, Shengyuan 1,200 dan, Changhe 3,100 dan.

The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below. Ningbo cotton arrivals increase daily.</p>
<p>Spot cotton sales have turned sluggish again. The daily arrival of Ningbo cotton is increasing. Sources estimate: Peach Blossom 2,172 bales, Tonghua 5</p>
<p>Fire Engine Flower 57.00, Shenxin Factory Import 500 bales, September Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Also 56.75, Also 500 bales, Also Also</p>
<p>Peach Blossom 29.00, Guangdong Gang 800 bales, Spot Delivery</p>
<p>Also 29.00, Miscellaneous Gang 700 bales, Also Also</p>
<h3>U.S. Cotton Spot Prices Are Still Stable - Buyers Remain Cautious</h3>
<p>Yesterday's opening for U.S. cotton was relatively active. Due to Liverpool's firmness and purchases by peers and Liverpool, there was rain in most cotton areas, and all months rose by 5 to 10 points. There was not much short selling, and spot prices were quite stable. Buyers were still watching, fearing that short selling would increase after the weather cleared. Later, local gangs sold, and a part of it was discovered to be a return. It was finally driven up again by short covering and New Orleans purchases. Spot prices rose by ten points, and futures rose by nine to fourteen points. British cotton spot prices rose by three points, and futures rose by one point. Indian cotton was initially firm due to short covering and purchases by futures merchants, but later slightly retreated due to cross-selling by European exporters. Plain Gur rose by two rupees, Aumra rose by 4.75 rupees, and White Luo Creek rose by 5.25 rupees. The original telegram is on the left (10th telegram).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for White Luo Creek cotton on the 11th was 201 rupees, the same as the previous day's closing.</p>
<h3>U.S. Cotton Exports Decline Sharply Last Season</h3>
<p>According to the U.S. Bureau of Statistics, the total amount of U.S. cotton exported during the 1934-35 cotton season ending at the end of July this year was 4,795,000 bales, a decrease of 2.7 million bales compared to the previous season and a decrease of 3.7 million bales compared to the season before that. This is due to the decline in the world cotton industry and the U.S. government's increase in cotton prices. The quantities of major exporting countries in the past three years are listed on the left (unit: thousand bales).</p>
<h3>Grains: Non-industry Speculators Suddenly Emerge, Smoothly Buying, Futures for Flour and Wheat Rise Consistently</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the flour market suddenly changed. Since the morning opening, the near and far months have risen across the board. The near months are due to the factories' low inventory and the active spot sales. The far months were stirred up by the smooth purchases of non-industry speculators. Factory short selling has gradually decreased, and yesterday's shipments were completely stopped. Furthermore, as foreign wheat rose, most people in the market were bullish. Once large buyers started buying, the buying trend became even stronger. The total transaction volume for the day also exceeded 600,000 bags. Short covering was also powerful. The far months were competed for by speculators and short covering, and the market atmosphere was hot. The closing price for this month and November was two cents higher, October was one and a half cents higher, December was two and a half cents higher, January was three and a half cents higher, and February was three cents higher.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, after the wheat market opened in the morning, foreign wheat prices continued to rise, with U.S. wheat rising by 12 cents and Canadian wheat rising by 23 cents. Furthermore, the market is still expected to continue to be good. Therefore, merchants and sellers were all watching, and short covering and non-industry speculators suddenly became active. The buying interest in the far months was even stronger, as the domestic wheat inventory has dried up and foreign wheat prices are still difficult to determine. Most people are bullish, and the far months are especially noticed by speculators. The closing price for January soared by one dime, December rose by eight cents, September and October each rose by five cents, and November rose by four cents. Spot wheat holders were originally bullish. Now, due to the lively flour market, they raised the price by one dime, which made the factories feel that the price was too high to make a deal. Even the few merchants who supplied the factories were extremely cautious.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat: The market was stagnant, waiting for the government's estimate to be released. After the close, the government announced that the spring wheat production was 163 million bushels, the same as expected.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat September 9 September 10 Change</p>
<p>December 93.475 93.625 Up 0.250</p>
<p>May 94.875 95.000 Up 0.125</p>
<p>Spot 22.500 12.750 Up 0.250</p>
<p>Canadian Wheat September 9 September 10 Change</p>
<p>December 88.250 88.750 Up 0.500</p>
<h3>Local Rice Market Has Seen Stability</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various gangs only arrived from the 12th and 13th (a total of 2,450 stones of goods). The market was stable and tense. Sales in this street were difficult. Yesterday, Baowei arrived in Qingdao and arranged for over 100 bags, and people's hearts were stable. As a result, the prices of Ruo Ge Po Jing and Bo Dao have started to rise by several cents. The higher-quality Xin Jing are even higher by 1-2 dimes due to the lack of high-quality goods. Only those in the middle range are more stable. As for the new Jian and Tuan Jian, they have continued to increase by several cents to one dime. Chen Yin Bian Yuan is still sluggish and close to a foot. (Announcement) Today, due to the Mid-Autumn Festival, the northern and southern businesses of the soybean rice industry will be closed for a day for major year-end closures, so there is no market.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from the lower reaches of the river were from the 14th and 15th. The various goods on the market were selling out, and the broken Jing continued to sell. The market price gathered and rose by nearly one dime. The Bo Dao was stable. Dong Xin Jing arrived in small quantities, and sales turned active. The price shape increased by two dimes. The sales of Xin Tuan Jian were active, and the price increased by another dime. The new Yang Jian had ordinary sales, and the market shape was high and firm. The medium-quality was soft. Bai Yuan was stable. Xin Ke Jian had slightly better sales, and the market shape was stable. The prices of the other goods were stable.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian Falls, Foreign Rice Barely Stands</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Ke Xian continued to arrive. Just in time for the Mid-Autumn Festival, many cargo owners were willing to sell at the market price, but importers did not buy in. The arrangements for Baowei rice from the lower reaches of the river were even more sluggish. Therefore, the high and low grades of Ke Xian continued to fall by a small amount of five or six cents. A total of more than 600 bags of Yongxian and 200 bags of Jing Cao were opened for sale throughout the day, and were distributed by this street and Beiyang.</p>
<p>The floating stock of foreign rice is scarce, and traders and speculators are still holding on, so the market has stabilized. Although Ke Xian was weak yesterday, foreign rice remained stable. However, a small number of floating stocks on the market and those returned from foreign ports were mostly sold at the market price. Yesterday, more than 2,000 bags of Saigon and Siamese rice were sold, and the prices were similar to the previous market. They were also distributed by the Beiyang gang and this street.</p>
<h3>New Sesame Opens for the First Time, Foreign Businesses - Jardine Matheson Buys 800 Tons</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign businesses opened the new sesame market for the first time. Jardine Matheson bought 800 tons at a price of 8 yuan and 2.5 cents, with delivery in November and December. 400 tons of old goods were also traded the day before yesterday at a price of 8 yuan and 1 dime (all of the above quotations are based on the old scale). At the moment, only one company is making arrangements, and it is a new goods transaction, so it does not dare to raise the price, so the market remains stable. The future situation depends on the situation of the year's harvest, which is abundant, so the future is flat.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: U.S. Silk Sales Start Up Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market was lively again. As the exchange rate shrank again and U.S. sales were still high, although the selling price remained the same, there were many transactions. The best-selling were white factory silks with an average grade of 78 and 20-23 denier. Sinfu, Jardine Matheson, Lienart and other companies bought 490 bales. Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival, and silk shops and foreign firms are closed for the holiday.</p>
<h3>The Tea Market is Becoming More and More Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market became increasingly quiet. European and American companies all sent out a large number of telegrams for the remaining Zhenmei, Xiami and various green teas on the market, but there was no reply, and the situation was very unfavorable. Only Xiehe, Fushi, Tongfu, Jinlong and other companies bought Zhenmei, Fengmei, Xiumei and other goods, totaling more than 200 boxes. They were all replenishing shortages and there was no need for wholesale. The market has fallen across the board.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Not Many Guangdong Coarse White Sugar Bids</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the bidding period for the Sugar Industry Cooperative Company again. The original amount was 2,400 bags of Wuyang coarse white sugar, with a bid price of 17 yuan and 2 dimes, and 300 bags were sold. In addition, there were 1,083 bags of Huizhou coarse white sugar, with a bid price of 16 yuan and 9.5 cents, and only 10 bags were sold. In addition, there were 1,000 bags of Guangdong Medium white sugar, with a bid price of 16 yuan and 5 cents, and 100 bags were sold. In addition, there were 2,000 bags of Dutch coarse white sugar, with a bid price of 17 yuan and 2 dimes, and 20 bags were sold. The total was 430 bags, which was less than before. The price lacked ups and downs. The association's prices for 24 coarse white sugar and re-exported goods were all quoted at the original price, and there were no transactions. No. goods were also not opened. Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival and the market is closed for one day.</p>
<h3>Metals: The Metal Market Becomes More Stagnant Before the Festival</h3>
<p>The Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching, and the metal trade is becoming more stagnant. Therefore, apart from those collecting debts being busier in the market, there is nothing worth mentioning in terms of trading. However, due to the scarcity of arrivals, the prices of various goods are still firm. Such as the Company's iron, Mako iron, flat white iron, new lead wire, cut iron, new foreign silver bamboo steel bars, I-beam iron and other varieties, all have a continued bullish trend. However, customers are unable to add to their stocks due to the urgent need for silver, and actual deliveries are at a standstill. Therefore, apart from opening 7-800 dan yesterday, there was no news of large orders. According to those familiar with the inside story of the metal industry, if the silver supply loosens slightly after the festival, the sales channels will definitely be promising. Moreover, as the source of supply is cut off and the inventory is about to be sold out, the prosperity of the market can be predicted.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: The First Batch of New Sheng Ren Appears</h3>
<p>The first batch of new Sheng Ren, with eight packages of Linhuai Pass Ren arriving in Shanghai, the goods are still good and should be arranged by the local gang at a price of about ten yuan. It is quite rare, but the small amount is not enough to be considered a formal market. According to Qingdao telegraph, Sheng Ren has also appeared in that area, and the spot price is eight yuan. The market may loosen later.</p>

<h3>The Mold of the May Fourth Movement</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>The story of the film "The God of Freedom" begins with the student movement of the May Fourth era. I couldn't help but laugh when I saw the simplicity of the Hangzhou Student Union office and the smallness of the girls' school classroom in the film. The characters of the May Fourth Movement in the author's mind are probably new-style heroes who are truly willing to endure hardship and sacrifice for society; the heroes' opponents - beauties - must also be born in simple classrooms. Those who talk about the "May Fourth" story are either involved in it themselves; in order to maintain their own reputation and status, they are of course unwilling to reveal the inside story. Some are derived from hearsay, always thinking that such a glorious social movement, the people who participated in that movement must be upright and open, but the fact is that all the despicable methods we now hear and see were already being tried in their subtle forms at that time; the mold was sown in the May Fourth era.</p>
<p>Taking the Hangzhou Student Union mentioned in "The God of Freedom" as an example, it should be a magnificent small Western-style house; that house is still the best house in the north corner of the Hangzhou New Market. And the few female student representatives are all "beauties" in the Grand View Garden by the Henghe Bridge. I'll tell you a small thing: the Hangzhou Student Union representatives traveling between Shanghai and Hangzhou all took first-class cars, the National Student Union representatives came to Hangzhou and stayed at the New New Hotel (the most luxurious hotel in Hangzhou), ate at Jufengyuan, and took chartered cars; this way we can understand that it is not surprising that the Student Union has such a magnificent clubhouse. (The Beijing student representatives often had ten or so banquets a day, even more lavish than members of Congress, not to mention.)</p>
<p>The real situation at the time was this: some political figures, who were more aware of the trend of the times, knew that this new mass movement had a great and irresistible force, and wanted to find ways to use it as a backing for their political activities. There are many ways to use it, and using money to buy it over must be the first thing everyone has. There are many ways for student representatives to sell themselves, but they are not necessarily more pure than those piglet parliamentarians at that time. All kinds of intricate intrigues that we can find on the political stage can also be found in the Student Union. Naturally, the things that were passionately impassioned and tearful on the podium were also acted out in various coats, just like ordinary politicians. Those student representatives who played the tricks more skillfully became the heroes produced by the situation. Zhou Mi's "Qi Dong Ye Yu" of the Southern Song Dynasty recorded the traveling scholars of the Southern Song Dynasty (college students at that time): "Most of them were unrestrained, and they lived in groups and used their private joys and angers to evaluate people. Some even used party affiliation to disrupt the government's policies, knocking on doors to seize the power of demotion and promotion, or receiving bribes to slander court officials, or setting up traps to deceive and threaten the people." These few words can roughly include the student representatives of the May Fourth era.</p>
<p>However, everyone should not despise the era significance of the May Fourth Movement just because I have exposed the dark side of the student representatives. The May Fourth Movement showed the bright pursuit of the youth of the era, showed the anti-resistance consciousness of the petty bourgeoisie, and set off a huge wave of the Chinese nation seeking liberation. Therefore, we should pay attention to this point, and never value those heroes with mold all over them, who were created by the situation!</p>
<p>Therefore, the film "The God of Freedom" is completely idealistic.</p>
<h3>野原</h3>
<p>— Laboring Heart</p>
<p>When I am provoked and wounded by the deceitful people, it awakens the wild nature within me, just like that of a beast. Hence, anger, depression, and even wild, howling roars. However, I understand how insignificant my position is, and that the cries of the weak will never be answered. Therefore, even as I watch that shameless and despicable enemy—a jackal—flaunting its teeth and claws, pretending to be victorious and triumphant, I remain silent, not uttering a sound, enduring it as I would the scorching heat of the sun above a hundred degrees.</p>
<p>But, I am also an animal of flesh and blood, and I, too, can be as irrationally savage as the barbaric races scorned by civilized gentlemen. How can I be confined within a cage of silence? Dear friend, you understand me; we once had a time when we handled our lives with such joy. You tell me, at a time like this, how can I not think of you?</p>
<p>Indeed, you once told me not to think of you. You also exhorted me not to be too serious in this hypocritical society. You taught me many ways to deal with those hypocritical fellows, and you repeatedly urged me not to be as quick-tempered as I used to be. I obeyed you in everything. However, over these years, has reality brought me any benefit? "That day" that you used to entice me with is still nowhere in sight, and my chest, already wounded by arrows, is now struck by a second arrow before the bloodstains have even dried. How can you ask me to endure any longer? How can you ask me not to think of you?</p>
<p>However, I still believe your words no matter what, and I have never strayed from the path we vowed to take together in the wilderness and on the beach. You can trust me on this until the very end.</p>
<p>"Look at the hawk, soaring so freely; look at the waves, ceaselessly striving and fulfilling their meager strength and duty. Should we, then, be as treacherous as jackals, deceiving mankind, deceiving friends, deceiving ourselves? No, we must not!..."</p>
<p>We must not! Yes, dear friend, I believe in you, and please believe in me as I believe in you. However, do you ever think of me, after we parted, soaring like the hawk without complaint, and surging like the waves without retreating? In such times, the battle wounds on my chest have never truly healed. Yet, believe me, my pair of strong arms can still bear the responsibility we have taken on... But how can this keep me from thinking of you? I know that you are even stronger and more confident. I know that you will never stray from the future we pledged in the wilderness and on the beach. You will remember that we have not met for a year. Perhaps we have both grown thin. How can this keep me from thinking of you, when I am surrounded by terrible and treacherous jackals?</p>
<p>Perhaps it is a dream. On this moonless summer night, I once again set foot in the wilderness where we once met. Ah, dear wilderness, it is still the same, vast and boundless, with nothing to be seen except for some unknown small creatures groping in the darkness. Near the beach, on a rock, there are still traces of our meeting. I sat there for as long as we sat there back then. The hawk is still soaring without complaint, and the waves are still advancing without retreating, but only I remain on the rock. Where have you gone, my friend? Are you surrounded by jackals?</p>
<p>Just wanted to let you know: the wilderness is unharmed.</p>
<h3>車站附近 (Near the Station)</h3>
<h3>這里是上海（上） (This is Shanghai, Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Dongli</p>
<p>This is Shanghai, No. 204, ×× Road, ×× Mansion. The room consists of two small interconnected rooms, with a monthly rent of two hundred taels of silver, equivalent to two hundred sixty or seventy silver dollars. The landlord has blue eyes and yellow hair. He claims to be American, but sometimes he also claims to be British, and he is about thirty years old. He wears a very flashy suit. No, not just "a flashy suit," but rather every suit he wears is very flashy. Do you understand? To put it another way, every one of his suits is very beautiful. Not only are the suits flashy, but also the "patent leather" shoes that are so shiny that even flies would slip and fall on them, the equally slicked-back hair that could make a fly slip, and the well-groomed face with its white skin—all indicate that he is a handsome man. What does he do? You must be asking. Well, let me tell you, he is a venereologist. To be more precise, he is a foreign doctor who specializes in treating venereal diseases for our high-class mistresses.</p>
<p>Outside the door, a porcelain sign with both Chinese and English characters sticks out its long neck. The English letters are a long string of abbreviations, with letters of varying heights. The Chinese characters read: ××××ton. Below, it is noted that he is a Doctor of Medicine from Germany and Belgium. Let me tell you, if you, a layman, come to him for treatment, you'll be out of luck and hitting a brick wall because this German-Belgian medical doctor's consultation hours are set at night. Strange, you think? It shouldn't be. If you believe that doctors' medical skills each have their own unique aspects, then it's perfectly acceptable for their consultation hours to be set at night. Isn't nighttime precisely when the mistresses come out for entertainment?</p>
<p>Speaking of business, while it can't be described as "crowded like a marketplace" (this is a mansion, after all, and marketplaces aren't allowed here), you can certainly say that the patients are coming in an endless stream. These patrons, hmph, when they arrive at the mansion in their black-licensed, white-lettered Ford V8 sedans or Buick cars, the doorman with the red turban is respectful enough, carefully rushing over to open the car door and bowing. They are either wives or young ladies, and due to the fragrance that wafts from them, you would never imagine that some part of their bodies is afflicted with a treatable blemish. But what does it matter? A disease on these fashionable people is not a big deal; they have stacks upon stacks of banknotes to spend on treatment! Besides, the disease itself sounds quite pleasant. What's it called—ah, what's it called "a romantic disease"? No, there's a more fashionable name, which you all know, called "a civilized disease"? After all, only civilized people get "civilized diseases"; we can't compare. Just our clothing alone keeps us far, far away from the word "civilized."</p>
<p>As they walk on the pavement, their high heels make crisp sounds on the terrazzo floor. Their overcoats and qipaos rustle in multiple layers. They are full of energy, but... as soon as they walk through the door of this great medical doctor, they become something else entirely. Before, they were eccentrics who looked down on everything, but now they have to speak nicely to the doctor and flatter him. Even so, this great doctor rarely smiles. Speaking of the great doctor's medical fees, they are naturally very high, and not a single penny can be skimped on. To do so would make the business seem sluggish and the status lower. Therefore, one injection of 606, even at the cheapest price, costs twenty-five dollars, which is many times more than the actual cost of the medicine. But, as they say, this is not considered expensive. The doctor and his patrons both think: doctors whose medicine is cheap are unlikely to cure diseases.</p>
<p>Now, the tall buildings in the city have blocked the setting sun, which is still more than a foot above the western horizon, and nightlife has already begun in this ××× Mansion. This German-Belgian medical doctor arrives outside the mansion in his newest "Studebaker" sedan. This car was given to him two months ago by the third mistress of a certain mansion, whom he had cured of early-stage venereal disease. The car's horn is quite something; when you press it, it makes two or three different sounds: Sao dao mi sao. After the great doctor confidently walks into his consulting room and sits down, he looks at the bright lights and cannot help but think of a recent romantic encounter. Just think, such a great doctor has opportunities to associate with his female patrons every night. A cigar is clasped between his fingers, lightly emitting smoke. The attendant has already cleaned the room. He has no assistant, taking care of everything inside and out. In fact, he doesn't need extra people. Since the patrons don't register and the injection procedures aren't complicated, and besides, his method of treating diseases is simply giving injections in a uniform manner. The price of injections varies greatly, twenty-five dollars for one injection, fifty dollars for one injection, and even one hundred dollars for one injection.</p>
<p>It is already completely dark, and the lights in the room seem even brighter. The nearby radio is broadcasting female vocals. A sound of leather shoes comes from the corridor, interrupting the great doctor's reverie. He guesses that it must be one of his patrons. He is not wrong. The sound of leather shoes stops at his door. Someone is knocking on the door.</p>
<h3>神仙 (The Immortal)</h3>
<p>— Wang Zhengyu</p>
<p>Zhao the Pockmarked was known and respected by everyone in Town C, because he was a scholar from the late Qing Dynasty and had also done something important: a Minister of Finance had bowed to him. Being a scholar was outdated now, but Zhao the Pockmarked often told people about his airs as a scholar in the past, which made people listen, respect, and admire him.</p>
<p>Two or three years ago, a young lady of Minister × disappeared. Minister × was naturally extremely anxious. His wife cried, made a scene, starved herself, and desperately tried to find her, because she was their only beloved daughter. Minister × forgot all about his official duties. This was a manifestation of putting personal matters before public duties. He was just frantically worried at home every day. When the police station heard that Minister ×'s daughter was missing, they naturally dispatched a large number of detectives, but after searching for a long time, there was still no news. In desperation, someone came to find this Immortal Zhao. Zhao the Pockmarked's transformation from a scholar to an immortal also had a little story behind it. It turned out that on a very hot day, everyone else was enjoying the cool air in the streets and alleys, but Zhao the Pockmarked was different. He put on a lined coat, closed the door, and stayed in his room. People laughed at him for being a bit foolish. Before long, who knew that dark clouds would gather, and there would be a torrential downpour, making it extremely cold. Everyone then sighed that Zhao the Pockmarked had indeed had foresight.</p>
<p>After this incident, Zhao the Pockmarked began to boast and brag, claiming that he could read faces, tell fortunes, calculate the Huangji Divine Numbers, and even more. He was also lucky, and many of the things he said turned out to be accurate. He began to think of himself as a living immortal, and the people in Town C also thought that he was displaying his divine powers and renamed him Zhao the Great Immortal instead of calling him Zhao the Pockmarked. He often responded to them: "Hmm!" When Minister × sent a car to Town C, Zhao the Pockmarked was so scared that he fainted. His face turned as white as a sheet.</p>
<p>"Wh... what is this thing? My heavens!"</p>
<p>"Reporting to the immortal, this is a car. The minister sent it to pick up the immortal." Two guards saluted Zhao the Pockmarked and said this to him.</p>
<p>Zhao the Pockmarked couldn't help but retreat a couple of steps. He thought that the soldiers were going to hit him for saying that. Later, he heard clearly that they were picking him up and calling him an immortal, and he became emboldened.</p>
<p>After a few days, Zhao the Pockmarked returned. Whether or not the minister's daughter had been found was not something people cared about. However, Zhao the Pockmarked had become an even more popular figure in Town C. Not only did the entire town welcome him, but the police station also set off firecrackers for him. Zhao the Pockmarked was truly imposing and proud. Just looking at the clothes he wore when he left and the clothes he wore when he returned was enough to make people jealous. From then on, Zhao the Pockmarked became even more unscrupulous in Town C.</p>
<h3>夢（一） (Dream, Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Zang Kejia</p>
<p>The short, cold winter sun was only a few feet above the western horizon. In this cemetery, the gloomy ancient cypresses had already gathered the twilight even earlier. Crows and magpies chattered as they swirled towards this place from all directions. Each nest was perched atop hundred-foot-tall white poplars, swaying in the evening wind as if greeting their masters.</p>
<p>Wang Er's wife, who looked after the forest, pushed open the half-broken straw-woven door and peeked out, but a gust of cold wind choked her back inside. "It's time," she thought, and ran out of the door a second time, trotting to the small grassy area to the east to gather an armful of pine branches. The wind blew her back into the door.</p>
<p>She added two ladles of water to the pot and slipped in a few red cornbreads, preparing a good meal for her husband's return. Yes, it was time for him to come back. The wind outside was so strong, and he only wore a thin old padded jacket. He must be very cold now. Thinking this, she shivered herself.</p>
<p>The pine branches crackled under the pot, and the pine resin burned like a ball of fire. She sat on a wooden plank, fiddling with the wood, and stared at the flames, calling to maintain its position beneath the center of the pot. Suddenly, her left eyelid started to twitch. As soon as she felt it, a sense of worry and fear gripped her heart. She was superstitious about this, just as she believed that the hooting of an owl (note) could bring misfortune. She knew that something inauspicious was about to approach; experience had told her that it was never ambiguous. But she dared not think in that direction. She broke off a pine needle, wet it with saliva, and pressed it on her twitching eyelid, pathetically trying to comfort herself: "The right eye twitches for joy, the left eye twitches for food," she said in a low, prayerful voice. But the pine needle didn't work at all, as if a witch could not subdue the haunting spirit. Her worries and fears suddenly increased. She sighed and kept her eyes on the fire beneath the center of the pot. The fire was red, like the tongue of a devil stretching out to her, further increasing her fear. To restrain herself, she closed her eyes and counted the number of times her eyelid twitched with each breath, once, twice. She silently prayed to the God of the Stove to gradually calm it down. No one knew how long her eyes were closed, but the more she counted, the more the numbers increased, yet she counted them meticulously. Only when the water in the pot was boiling loudly did she open her eyes.</p>
<p>"No wonder I had such a strange dream last night," she thought, again connecting the dream of the night before with the twitching of her eyelid now. "Two giant, towering black men, I couldn't see their faces when I looked up. I only felt one of them grasp my hand firmly with a fan-like hand and pull. I felt a piercing pain and fell into blood. When I finally came to, the two giants were long gone, but I had become a bloody, shapeless mass without arms or legs." Recalling the dream, her whole body trembled, not to mention her heart. She hadn't even dared to tell her husband about it. Just thinking about it made it seem as if those two men were standing in front of her.</p>
<p>She was normally quite courageous; she had spent years in this gloomy cemetery, listening to the rustling of the white poplars, and had never felt oppressed or lonely. But today, it was different.</p>

<p>Discourse</p>
<h3>美共黨撕毀德輪國旗案的判决 (The Verdict of the Case of the American Communists Tearing Up the German Ship's Flag)</h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>The incident happened not long ago, and everyone should remember that on July 26th, an incident occurred in the United States in which members of the Communist Party tore up the flag of a German ship. On that day, when the German mail ship "Bremen" was about to set sail from New York back to Europe, American Communist Party members suddenly surged onto the ship to hold an anti-National Socialist demonstration. They tore down the German flag on the ship and threw it into the sea. The German ambassador then lodged a protest with the State Department, and many people were arrested at the scene. At the time, it caused a slight ripple, and observers predicted that the US government would definitely convict the rioters of some crimes to appease German indignation. However, the matter turned out to be completely unexpected. The case has recently been tried in court, and the five defendants who were arrested have been released immediately. Not only that, but even more strangely, Judge White Law Zeski of the New York District Court, when hearing the case, also denounced Hitler's politics, referring to the "Bremen" as a pirate ship flying a black pirate flag, saying that the swastika flag flying in New York Harbor was seen by the defendants as a symbol antagonistic to Americanism. However, he stated that his words should not be taken as an excuse for the riot. Only the sixth defendant, who possessed firearms without a passport, was slightly punished.</p>
<p>National Socialism and Communism are mortal enemies, and conflicts are inevitable. However, for American Communist Party members to hold an anti-National Socialist demonstration to the extent of tearing up the German flag and throwing it into the sea is clearly an insult to Germany. The national flag is the representative of the country, and insulting the national flag is equivalent to insulting the country. If this case had happened in a country weaker than Germany, it might have caused a major dispute. Fortunately, the United States is now more powerful than Germany, so Germany can only lodge a protest and has no choice. Little did they know that not judging the case would have been better than judging it, as the verdict only made Germany more embarrassed. Judge White Law Zeski's few words were really too excessive. The swastika flag, in the eyes of the Germans, is of such dignity. White Law Zeski actually referred to it as a pirate symbol and said that the defendants saw the flag flying in New York Harbor as a symbol antagonistic to Americanism. This kind of treatment is no wonder Germany was greatly enraged and considered it a great insult to Germany. It is said that German newspapers are hoping that the US government can take the necessary steps to correct this action that insulted a friendly country. And the German ambassador to the United States has also lodged an oral protest with the US State Department. The ambassador refused to disclose the truth of the conversation afterward but said that this conversation was quite interesting. This is indeed a unique event in international relations.</p>
<p>I remember that not long ago, German leader Hitler gave a speech to National Socialist Party members, saying that the swastika flag could not be removed from the hearts of the German people for the next five hundred years. This shows how strong the swastika flag's power is in Germany. Unfortunately, it has now suffered such an insult from the United States. I wonder what Hitler will think.</p>
<h3>筏 (Raft)</h3>
<p>— Luo Zhihua</p>
<p>From Juye County to Jining, the journey is calculated to be ninety li, passing through very few towns, and one must travel forty-five li to reach Jiaxiang County.</p>
<p>The raft that Sun Er and his group of nearly ten people were sharing had been moving forward for quite some time, but the shadow of Jiaxiang County was still nowhere to be seen, not even the azure-colored mountains in that area. All around were sandy yellow torrents, as if trapped in enemy territory. They struggled and moved forward. But they could not determine the correct direction and route, and vaguely moved forward.</p>
<p>Sun Er, a burly man in his thirties, stood at the stern of the raft with Xiao Fang, both of them holding poles, but the water was often too deep to reach the bottom.</p>
<p>Sun Er wiped the sweat from his forehead with his rolled-up sleeves and looked back at his companions. Fatigue seemed like an iron chain, weighing down their heads and eyelids. He turned his gaze to the famous miser Qi Yaqi. Qi Yaqi was wearing a coarse blue cloth long gown, a black satin "hat pad" on his head, and small glasses. He had a letter in his hand and an envelope stuffed in his pocket. He sat on a small bundle, reading his letter. Sun Er knew that he was calculating things after arriving in Jining, and asked him, "Uncle Qi, what are you planning...?"</p>
<p>Having suddenly and loudly heard him calling out to him, he replied noncommittally, "Visiting relatives, visiting relatives... What about you...?"</p>
<p>"What hope do I have? Still just going to sell my labor..."</p>
<p>As he spoke, the pole touched the ground and the raft moved forward. Xiao Fang looked ahead worriedly, "Why can't we see those mountains yet? Not even a village."</p>
<p>Old Granny Song, who was eighty years old, felt her legs numb from fatigue. She wanted to stand up, but her small feet could not support her, and the swaying of the raft made her dizzy, so she had to sit down again, her eyes idly looking around, sighing.</p>
<p>Sitting next to her was Sun Er's wife, who was no more than twenty years old. She already had three children. The one in her arms was only three months old, and the second child, who was only two years old, was squatting nearby. The other child was only three years old.</p>
<p>"Mom, I'm hungry!" the eldest child said weakly, hugging Sun Er's wife's knee. Two lifeless eyes looked at her face with pleading and hope. This expression made the mother's heart ache with sadness. She had been sick and thin at home, and now the hunger and fear after the flood had made her skin turn smoky yellow and sallow black. The distance from death was probably not too far. She patted the child who had just fallen asleep in her arms and then coaxed the other two. The children occupied her entire life.</p>
<p>What the child said reminded her that she had an empty stomach. What the child said reminded everyone on the raft that they had not eaten, but they had no way to satisfy their needs.</p>
<p>Just at this moment, Xiao Fang pointed to the distance on the left and said:</p>
<p>"There are houses over there. Maybe there are people..."</p>
<p>The raft turned its direction, and after moving not far, they could see figures moving. Further on, they could hear shouts and sounds. There were rows of houses, some of which had collapsed, leaving only the beams. People were waiting for rescuers to arrive. As the raft approached, Qi Yaqi patted the box around his waist and said, "If we need to get food, I, Qi, will pay!" His eyes darted around several times. The children's hunger had not been coaxed away and they were constantly clamoring for food. Hearing Qi Yaqi's excited words, the lifeless eyes seemed to add a lot of color. Granny Song and her daughter barely managed to stand up. Everyone else also gazed at this patch of rooftops with anticipation, forgetting the powerless sandy yellow torrent behind them.</p>
<p>However, Qi Yaqi was the first to be disappointed. He had money but could not buy food: the people here had also been without food for days. Naturally, a group of empty-bellied people fell silent.</p>
<p>"Brothers, let's be frank, we can't stay here. Let's all go to Jining!"</p>
<p>Qi Yaqi objected as if in disagreement to the person who spoke, "That won't work. This raft isn't sturdy. Can it handle more people?... He believed that since he had provided the money for the wood, the right to decide belonged to him. In fact, Xiao Fang and Sun Er were both willing to take a few people out of this water-besieged disaster, and he couldn't ask too much. The raft had been tied together two days ago. It was very sturdy and did not seem too worrying with more people on it. Qi Yaqi agreed that four people could come up.</p>
<p>The journey was long...</p>
<p>Ahead, it was dark and black, like willows, growing thickly there, forming a circle. Sun Er had long thought that this must be a deep pit, and he held the pole steady, proceeding safely ahead...</p>
<p>Suddenly, as he thrust the pole into the water, a gust of wind swirled the waves, and the raft lost its balance. Sun Er's large body fell into the water. The sudden movement caused the people on the raft to lose their balance, and Xiao Fang fell onto the raft. The raft turned in the whirlpool like an axle. The turbid and icy water submerged them...</p>
<p>Several black boat shadows passed by in the back, perhaps heading to Jining, but the mountains of Jiaxiang were still nowhere in sight.</p>
<h3>Hakata</h3>
<p>— Yuan Yuan</p>
<p>——Traces of a Journey to Japan——</p>
<p>The train arrived at Hakata in Fukuoka just as dawn was breaking. Because we hadn't booked a hotel in advance, everyone went into the waiting room at the station to wait while the guide negotiated with the hotels.</p>
<p>The station's waiting room was well-appointed. I sat on the comfortable sofa, my eyes heavy with sleep, wanting nothing more than to doze off. Some of my companions hadn't had a chance to wash up on the train, and when they saw a sign in the room next to the waiting room that read "Dressing Room," they all went to freshen up. The dressing room was complete with everything, and it was also clean and tidy; there was soap, wooden combs, and all sorts of small items available. It was really convenient for us travelers, and from this, you could see that the Japanese government does things for its people.</p>
<p>After a while, the guide found a hotel in the travel guide provided at the station and called to make arrangements. Soon after the call, the hotel sent someone to pick us up. The person from the hotel was wearing a black kimono, and their attitude was so gentle and their hospitality so attentive that we were truly surprised. Seeing their honest and sincere appearance, we couldn't help but feel a sense of trust and goodwill toward their hotel out of thin air.</p>
<p>We jumped into a tram. When buying tickets, the conductor gave each of us a ticket. After the guide's explanation, we learned that those who boarded before 7:30 in the morning received an extra discount coupon, which could be used for travel in the afternoon. The company's intention was to reward those who get up early, but those who could receive their discount were probably laborers and students.</p>
<p>After getting off the tram, we passed through a building that looked like an old temple, and then we were on a very clean asphalt road. Because it was still early, there weren't many pedestrians coming and going, but it was already clear that this was a prosperous place. Compared to Nagasaki, it was truly like heaven and earth.</p>
<p>The hotel was directly across from the old building we had passed through. It was a completely Japanese-style hotel. There was only a small patch of ground at the entrance where you could step without taking off your shoes. That small patch of ground was prepared for us to take off our shoes and place them there before stepping onto the tatami mats, which were about a foot or so off the ground.</p>
<p>Four or five neatly dressed maids were kneeling on the tatami mats, but they were all quite old. They kept saying welcoming words, carrying our small items, and leading the way. We walked upstairs and felt that it was dark and gloomy, with insufficient light, and it was also a dark wooden building. We took two rooms. The rooms were simply furnished, which gave me a sense of desolation. There was a low table with short legs, a telephone extension on the table, writing brushes, inkstones, and stationery. There was also a mirror placed in the corner of the room. From these things, we knew that although it wasn't a luxury hotel, it also wasn't a shabby inn, but rather a place prepared for respectable people to stay.</p>
<p>We hadn't eaten anything in the morning, so everyone decided to have milk and bread. The maids came immediately and placed twelve cushions around us. We sat around in a circle. The maids brought tea, kneeling in the center and distributing tea to us. Sitting in the Japanese style with both knees bent is originally a way to calm the mind, and now with a cup of clear tea, sipping it little by little, it really has a unique flavor.</p>
<p>The most famous product of the Hakata area is "Ningyo," which is really what we call clay figurines. However, they don't necessarily sculpt Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. There are many different styles. The clay is good, and the white powder and colors applied are also good. And there are specialized people who paint the faces. They are like painters and don't just casually draw two eyebrows, two eyes, and a mouth to get it over with. When they sculpt, they pay attention to the curves of the face, and when they depict the features, they pay attention to different expressions. Such "Ningyo" naturally have different levels of artistic value.</p>
<p>After lunch, we found a Ningyo shop near the hotel. There were many new-style Ningyo there. The so-called new-style refers to statues in modern clothing, or there are also Western-style dolls. Those were all very expensive, almost each one costing between one and three or four yen. We saw a statue of the movie star Rock and saw that the price was two yen, which we thought was too expensive.</p>
<p>Several young students wearing Western-style clothes waited on us very diligently, keeping watch as we made our selections. When we asked them the price, they always told us in a soft and respectful voice. I looked for a long time, but the Ningyo I wanted to buy was really too expensive. Not buying anything would have been embarrassing, so in the end, I picked the cheapest one, a hangable "Head of Jesus at the Time of Confession." It cost one yen and fifty sen, worth fifty cents in Chinese currency.</p>

<p>Opening "Emperor Yang of Sui Watching the Ring Flowers"</p>
<p>Emperor Yang of Sui was romantic. He did not worry about the country's plans and people's livelihoods. His indulgence in wine and women was excessive. Loyal ministers and righteous men did not agree with him. He cruelly disregarded reason and dared to plot against his father and ruler. Hearing that a ring flower was blooming, he immediately issued an imperial decree to visit Yangzhou. He wasted the people's labor and wealth and specially used land boats. The songs on both sides of the river were filled with hatred for thousands of miles. A ship's worth of lights caused the sorrow of ten thousand families. There were so many palace maids and eunuchs that shrimp whiskers were scattered all along the way. Traveling thousands of miles was truly a burden, and civil and military officials found it difficult to cope. Before the pleasure was exhausted, the beacon fire was already urgent. The loyal princes relied on the many princes. From then on, there was no end to the war. Even with great strategy, he could not plot. Li Mi and Li Yuan rebelled one after another. The ruler and his ministers soon became enemies. A chaotic country with an unprincipled ruler. It is most regrettable that the country of thousands of miles was lost all at once. It is said that there were more than three hundred autumns. I don't know if the Emperor Yang of Sui is underground. Such a monstrous crime is floating. How ashamed he would be to meet Brother Wen!</p>

<p>Opening "Mid-Autumn Festival"</p>
<p>Another year has passed easily and autumn is deep. Osmanthus fragrans is fragrant and the moon is full. The moon is more bright during the Mid-Autumn Festival. People are even more happy during the festive season. Let's strive together and supply fruit baskets. Incense smoke curls into the clouds. Although we celebrate the good night together, each person has their own circumstances and feelings. Some families are reunited to enjoy the Mid-Autumn Festival. The joys of family are the happiest. Some are setting up feasts with good friends. Clinking glasses to celebrate the good times. Some are boating on the night river to enjoy the moonlight. Two or three close friends are talking. Some are sweet lovers sitting in the park. I wish our relationship is as perfect as the round moon. Some are sisters who are appreciating the bright moon. Wearing skirts and scarves, they are cherishing the stories of Chang'e and playing the zither and trying to sing. Some are tourists separated from their hometown mountains and rivers. They miss their relatives every time they celebrate a festival. Some are couples standing shoulder to shoulder in front of the flowers. They are softly speaking sweet words. Some are young women in their boudoirs who are waiting for their husbands. The moonlight is like water, making them even more melancholy. Some are singing and dancing gracefully. They are like the music played by immortals in the Guanghan Palace. Even more, there are fishing boats with lights on the river. The sound of oars is hidden in the waves. Singing a moving song of the Great River Goes East. Every year we celebrate this day together. Every family burns incense tonight. I only hope that the flowers are beautiful, people live long, and the moon is always bright.</p>
