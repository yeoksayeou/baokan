<h3>三國會議成功之可能性</h3>
<p>— 恒</p>
<p>英法意之三國會議。現已進行預備談話不日卽　正式開幕。此會之召開。乃在最近國聯行政院集會前所决定。蓋行政院旣不能充分解决意阿問題。不得不於國聯以外。另尋一解决辦法耳。此項會議所根據者。大抵為一九〇六年英法意三國之對阿恊定。及一九二五年之英意交換牒文。前一協定。表面上承認尊重阿國之領士完整。實乃三國預備劃分阿國勢力範圍之契約。其最著者。卽該協定許意大利於阿國境內建造鐵路一點。至一九二五年之英意交換牒文。則英國更許意大利於鐵路經過之處獨佔種種經濟利益。故此會召開。後英國對意當比較的能以眞誠相見。不致徒唱高調矣。據最近歐電。英國準備依照一九二五年兩國互換牒文內所開條件。許意大利得在阿國獲取廣大之經濟利益。但不承認其政治的優惠權。英國此種建議。雖未必全為意所接受。然英國對意阿問題。已回至一九二五年之立塲。固已極為明顯就此以觀。設此會議竟能成功。意阿戰爭。或可避免然阿國之獨立主權。要不能不受幾分危害矣。</p>
<p>此會成功之可能性現尙在不可知之數。然其及於歐局之影響殊非淺鮮。良以英國今次行動。具有極大决心。若法意不能與英協調。則英且欲退出歐洲集體和平制度。無論法國受德威脅。或奧國受德侵犯。均將置之不問。（見十四日巴黎電）。英國此種步驟。足使法意威受極大不安。兩國顧慮及此。卽可增加此次會議成功之可能性矣。言法國。一九二五年英國對意之建議。法曾竭力反對。認為遠反一九〇六年三國協定維持阿國七地完整門戶開放之原則。（見一九二六年七月十四日白里安復英意之牒文。）近來法國所以處處迎合意大利之意志者。無非欲意國贊助其對德之立塲耳。然而歐洲集體和平制度之建立。尤有賴於英國之支持。設英國宣吿退出。則法國對德之立塲。必受極大威脅。雖有意大利之合作。亦無濟於事故法國於此。稍變其一味緩助意大利之政策。竭力斡旋。俾能成立三國恊調。實為意中事也。以言意國。觀於墨索里尼歷來宣。言大有吞滅阿國全疆之志。但若因三國會議破裂結果。英國退出歐洲集體和平制度。中歐局勢。卽將大變。此時意大利雖欲經營阿國。亦不能不有所顧忌。墨索里尼往時雖曾暗示與德國携手之一策然其前提有二。（一）德國承認奧國之獨立。（二）意國有割棄法國友誼之决心。觀于目前情勢。意國與德携手。殊無較大之利益可言。且就一九二五年英意互換牒文而觀意大利對於阿國之希望原不過如英人之所建議今若放棄對阿武力行動。屈就英人建議。亦不能謂為喪失體面。故意國對于此次英方建議大體上或能接受。亦未可知也。</p>
<h3>美財長再聲明　購銀隨市價進退　穩定銀價並防銀派活動　星期三購二千餘萬盎斯</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）財長毛根韜今日宣稱、財部於星期三日曾購進白銀二千五百萬盎斯、計此一日購進之白銀量、實較去年全國之生產量為尤大、財長更謂、財部購銀計劃、隨銀價之跌落而逐步增加、財長並謂、此次購進者皆在紐約倫敦兩處、此後更當繼續購進、毛氏同時否認近數日內怠於購銀之風說、至於政府購銀計劃　於市塲有何影饗發生、毛氏則稱不知、至銀幣流通額之大小、毛氏以為數前梢見減少、（十四日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）財長毛根韜今日在種種謠言及銀派參議員抗議後發表之言論、許多方面視為防免參院調查購銀程序及阻止世界白銀多頭鐵續了結之舉動、毛氏又稱、市價低落時、財部購銀增多、此乃好交易、此種政策使財部在價格平穩時不甚活動、但在投機家了結時極為活動、近來印度與中國有巨量售出、以致世界銀價暴跌云、（十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>倫敦銀市較穩　美財長一言之結果</h3>
<p>（倫敦）今晨銀市較為穩定、此乃美財長毛根韜昨在華盛頓發表言論聲明美國將繼續購銀、以期淘汰多頭所致、據衆估計、美國在過去三日內購進白銀約為五千萬至六千萬盎斯、金融時據稱、自白銀案通過以來、美國共已購得新出礦白銀三八·五〇五·〇〇〇盎斯、國有白銀一一二·九一二〇〇〇盎斯、又在公開市塲購進二七〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇盎斯、同時美國金準備、業已大增、故所存白銀在比較並不為多、故購銀案所定金三銀一之比率、目前相距猶遠、據專家估計、從美國從今不再購進黃金、美國尚須購八十萬萬盎斯白銀、始可適合此比率云、（十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）各報皆在前幅登載白銀新聞、以其交易極巨也、估計美國今日從多頭方面購得二千五百萬盎斯、印度與中國前從事多方者、因美國購銀政策未有新發展、故爭先售出、以期結東、昨日美國以較前稍低之價格巨量購進、今日多方鑒於昨日之跌價、紛紛　出、市價掛牌初較昨低一便士七五、繼又低二五、美國購銀旣多、不得不大購外匯、於是美元匯價以英鎊折合之、遂疲弱矣、昨今兩日賣風大熾、多方籌碼乃大减少、故銀市呈更穩健氣象、（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（紐約）垣街以為銀價之續跌、乃投機家失望之反映、蓋投機家覺財部不維持銀價、而國會又在休會之狀態中、故預料暫時未必有利於銀派之舉動、乃陸續了結、紐約市塲中有財部繼續購進之說、但據白銀商人云、財部對於交貨及時期特別認眞、故一般人以為財部此舉使投機家感受出售之困難、同時議塲對於銀價之低　不置一詞、惟參議員畢特門評論此事、謂渠毫不驚惶、因渠確信財部行動必有把握也云（十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>美參院銀派擬提案　調查政府行動　鑒於銀價低落而不安　總統核准社會安全法</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）參院銀派領袖湯默斯今日宣佈、彼擬要求參院農業委員會調查政府之購銀政策、湯氏謂銀價今復低落、故彼以為應有舉動云、惟此間中立之觀察者及專家則以為銀價之低落、有三大原因、（一）投機家以為財部暫時不欲積極購銀、（二）國會閉幕期近、促督政府加緊購銀之壓力將漸消滅、（三）最近美元對於英磅之比價暴跌、同時參議員麥卡倫已提出取消白銀利益稅作為股富稅案之修正案、如麥氏要求表决、　將於本星期中投票、惟麥氏稱、如無確實通過之把握、彼亦不擬要求表决云、（十四日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）民主黨參議員湯姆士為參院銀派之領袖、今日聲稱、渠現草擬一提案、請國會調查政府購銀程序、調查並非對於個人而作、但與政府全盤程序有關、如購銀程序果須實施、則應立卽實施之、因現政府並未有永遠秉政之擔保也、如此程序不須實施、則亦應立卽停止、不必久延、（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）羅總統今日批准社會安全案、並稱、此案乃尙未完成的新建築之基石、過去百年之文化與其工業方面之驚人變更、已使生活愈呈不安全之象、今日此案已實現多年希望之一大部份、將注意人類需要、並謂美國成立更穩健的經濟結構云、（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）參院今日討論羅斯福總統之殷富稅案、共和黨議員范登堡動議將此案留待下次國會集會時考慮、表决結果、范氏動議為五十五票對十九票否决、此為共和黨首次進攻現政府之失敗、（十四日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）農業整理處今日將一九三六年小麥調整契約中所需要之麥田减額由百分之十五减為百分之十、此項變史將使一九三六年美國麥田增多五百二十萬美畝、農長對記者稱、八月份麥產報吿表示美國麥產因黑銹病及氣候亢熱之傷害、大為减少、故至此報吿發表後、乃决定縮小减額、渠希望此舉可使美國在世界輸出市塲中立於堅强之地位云、（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）參議員彭海德今日預料當局將於本週杪前後宣佈一角二分之棉花借欵（十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>美與遠東經濟　有問羅斯福是否派調查團</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）今日有人詢問羅斯福總統、美國有無派遣經濟調查團至中國之意思、羅總統當將此問題轉交國務部、按此問題之提出、原因在美國對於英國派遺羅斯爵士赴華調查經濟、態度過於冷淡所致、美國方面更謂、最近由遠東返美之美國經濟調查團、及完全代表商業團體之私人組織、與政府絕無關係云、（十四日國民社電）</p>
<h3>斐律濱向美　要求維持市塲　准斐貨自由輸美</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）斐律濱副總督海登曾致函參院屬地事務委員會主席泰定斯、謂經過詳細研究一切事實之後、已知斐島物產、如不能繼續大批自由輸入美國市塲、則斐島之獨立政府將不能有充分之收入、以維持中央或地方政府之開支、斐島之生活程度、較之遠　各處、高出甚多、故其物產、除美國外、萬難與他國在任何市塲競爭、若經濟上發生困難、則政治上之不安自當隨之而起、故美國　實施全部對斐之進口稅率、則自治政府之試騐必將失敗、海氏以為美斐間最妥善之互惠商約、為使不與美國農工出品競爭之貨物、得自由輸入、同時美貨亦以同等條件、作為交易、目前美國方在全世界覓求貿易、是則對於斐島市塲又何不維持而發揚之耶云云、（十五日國民電）</p>
<h3>日滿經濟委會　日方委員隨員决定</h3>

<p>（長春）滿洲貿易近年來成為崎形的發展、卽自九一八後由歷年之出超、一變而為入超、輸入貨物、幾為日貨獨佔、本年上半年之輸入貿易、日貨竟佔七成以上、故滿洲已造成為日貨之專有市塲矣、斯波堪芒台那哀達胡與鄂利貢三州昆連處之森林地數千英畝失火、救火員千人刻正奮力施救、林中野獸如熊鹿兔類、為火熖被這、紛紛亂竄、恐野獸死者甚多、（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>查本年上半期之貿易、輸出為二億二千五百二十九萬二千元、輸入為二億九千八百二十四萬三千元、比之去年度、不特輸出大差、輸入更有三千十二萬九千元之急增、入超一躍為七千二百九十五萬一千元、再者輸入總額中之日本商品、竟佔二億一千四百二十五萬五千元、逾全額七成之上、今將九一八事變前一九三一年以來之滿洲貿易大勢、舉出數額以觀、（單位千元）</p>
<p>三一出超三九，七六二</p>
<p>三二出超二八〇，四八四</p>
<p>三三入超六七，三五四</p>
<p>三四入超一四五，一三五</p>
<p>三五（半年中）入超七二，九五〇</p>
<p>卽自入一九三三年以來、「滿洲」貿易驟由傳統的出超、轉變為入超、而逐年輸出漸减、輸入於增、至本年上半期、竟達到空前之入超、最値得注意者、卽日貨之進出關係驟增而入超所及、影響、「滿洲」之財政者亦大、</p>
<p>至於輸出减退之原因、主要者有二、卽（一）世界農業恐慌、（二）對華輸出不振貿易斷絕、因自九一八以來、「滿洲」之輸出、約减少六成、至於輸入之增多、則因日貨之充斥及由日本輸出之建設鐵路等材料增加之故、惟另有數種商品、則反招致輸出增加輸入减少者、計招致輸出增加者、為鋼鐵·硫黃·木材·及媒炭·羊毛·鹽·牛肉·亞麻等、輸入减少者、為小麥粉·洋灰·鐵器·媒油·啤酒·木材及其他棉花·麻袋。紙烟等、總之、近年來滿洲貿易、已成為崎形之發展、受日本經濟勢力之支配矣、（十五日華聯社電）</p>

<p>（南京）英國政府擬於本年秋舉行海軍軍縮會議、積極進行準備、英外交部參事官格萊基日前會見日本駐英代理大使藤井之結果、遂决意於本年十月在倫敦召開軍縮正式會議、最近非公式通達藤井代理大使、並請傳達本國外務省、英國曾與德國交涉海軍問題成立恊定、豫定於九月初與法意兩國進行交涉、完畢準備工作後、卽與美國開始交涉、而不待該項豫備交涉之成否、在十月召開正式會議、解决一切問題、日外務省十四日接到英政府非公式請貼、卽時傳達海軍省、外海兩省似將應允英國招請出席會議、在緊張空氣中進行準備矣、（十五日日聯電）</p>

<p>未蘭據派往摩來爾地方調查該處湖閘潰决原因之委員會報吿、水閘潰决原因係連日大雨、湖中水位較平時高出十五呎、對於石基壓力過大所致、唯此湖之主要水閘、以建築堅固、並未毀壞、僅近傍用作原動力之蓄水池、不勝壓力、先行潰决、待猛濤衝入位於其下之湖中、湖閘始為衝毀、蓄水遂一瀉而盡、以至平時一千八百萬立方公尺水量之湖水、至今僅剩二百萬立方公尺之水量矣、現雨水雖尙未停、但湖閘已無再行潰决之虞、按此湖及用作原動力之蓄水設備為十年前所建、水閘潰决今猶為第一次、調查委員會現已奉命研究補救方法矣、（十五日國日電）</p>

<p>（南京）林陸相於十五日閣議散會後與新聞記者團會見、對於永田軍務局長遭難後最初表示其心境、茲錄其所談於下、本月十二日永田中將突然遭難、此事在國軍名譽上實屬遺憾、千萬當係余之德薄有以致之、痛感責任之重大、關於此次事件、須講求相當之善後處置、以便確立今後部內之統制、殊覺係當前余之重大職責也、但在陸軍方面實為空前之巨案、故其影響所及亦甚嚴重、不能不處以深刻之關心、對於犯罪之內容等情、目下正由軍法會議審理、尙未便說明、至於善後處置、余今日在閣議席上、亦未有所陳述、但講求適當之善後處置、余亦正在考慮之中、岡田首相亦謂當極力設法、甚望此際考究善處之策、並作各種激勵之辭矣云云、（十五日日聯電）</p>
<h3>日閣議决定　取締奇怪文件　將製成法律嚴厲執行　林陸相昨訪岡田首相</h3>
<p>（東京）林陸相於十五日閣議席上說明永田局長遭難之原因時、據謂、「盲從奇怪文件之所說」、乃惹起此種不祥事件、該奇怪文件實為發難之原因、已甚明顯、故閣議亦對於取締此項奇怪文件、再三協議之結果、當將取締奇怪文件案須嚴厲執行、認為由關係各省如內務司法等省詳加研究後、决計作為法律案、向下屆議會提出、業經意見一致矣、並聞對於此項奇怪文件之發行者須處以相當之體刑、而執行嚴重之取締云（十五日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）林陸相十五日晨九時半訪問岡田首相、報吿永田少將遇刺事件眞相、及傳訊犯人相澤中佐之情形後、說明其决意、謂今次發生軍務局長暗殺事件、對於統制軍部至為遺憾、本人甚覺責任重大、然因時局嚴重、不欲拘泥區區責任論、决意積極進行善後辦法、肅正軍規以計强化統制軍部工作、待一切目的達到、而事件、解决後、將負一身責任、决定進退、岡田首相答謂、閣員一致希望陸相留任原職、並邀勵陸相、邁進統制國軍目的、（十五日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）林陸相於十四日在閣議席上說明永田少將被殺事件及其對於統制軍部之方針、及閣議散會、卽時招致橋本次官及今井軍務局長等至其官邸、恊議應以如何方法統制軍部問題、據林陸相意見一片形式的訓令、恐無効果、故命橋本次官早時研究最有効果之統制軍部具體方法、橋本奉命後、卽與今井軍務局長·山岡整備局長·後宮人事局長等、考慮具體方法、據聞其內容如下、（一）召開軍司令官師團長會議、（二）召開團隊長會議、（三）召開參謀長會議、（四）傳達三長官、關於肅軍訓令、然陸軍調動人員未久、且因永田急死、今井新任軍務局、繼任事務不能迅速進行、各項事務頗難辦理、故召開如上各種會議、必需相當時日、又林陸相認改革軍部上級人員為統制軍部之最緊急事件、擬於日內對其他二長官表示此决意實行改革、（十五日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）林陸相會見崗田首相時、微露事件吿一段落後、擬引咎辭職、因此各方面均甚注意、岡田首相及各閣員雖懇請林陸相留任、但林陸相辭意堅决、故其辭任恐為時期問題、（十五日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）傳林陸相於三長官會議時、曾表示辭意、故其辭任最已成為時期問題、惟此次事件最初善後措置之臨時軍司令官師團長會議、將於八月底開會、故本月內當不致提出辭呈、至於陸相之後任、已擬定由渡邊教育總監繼任、並擬以軍事參議官川島大將或同阿部信行大將繼任教育總監、又若二大將周辭時、將推舉台灣軍司令官寺內大將、（十五日電通電）</p>
<h3>英法先事商定　三國會議原則　以一九二九年英意換文　為意阿問題談判之基礎</h3>
<p>（巴黎）據可靠消息、英閣員艾登昨已與法總理賴伐爾商妥、阿比西尼亞問題之三國會議要點、卽（一）純在國聯機構內處理意阿爭議、（二）法國不干預英意間之談判、談話時兩人對於和平之維持與國聯義務之履行均表示深切之關心、並皆以為三國會議可供獻九月四日國聯集議前獲得和平解决之最後機會、艾登當時曾切實說明、菲洲之戰事一旦發作、則歐洲等處必將因以發生範圍更廣之事件、英國朝野關於竟阿爭議問題之意見可稱一致云、</p>
<p>法政府得悉英國所定由阿國以經濟讓予權給予意國之計畫、此項計畫之內容、迄今尙未宣露、惟聞其可適合（一）担保阿國士地完整及畫定三國勢力範圍之一九〇六年條約、（二）一九二八年意阿條約及國聯盟約、按一九二五年英意兩國曾交換公文、意國承認英國有處置柴那湖之權利、英國元不反對意國在愛利特里腹地與意屬索瑪里興築鐵路之計畫、此項公文今可為談判之基礎、第須勸喻意相墨索里尼接受英法為應意國開拓殖民事業而給與之權利、今料英法兩國將運用勢力、使阿皇允以此項權利給與意國、昨日之談話、賴伐爾有外交部政治指導員巴爾治頓為助、艾登則携外交次官樊西泰特爵士為助、</p>
<p>意代表阿洛錫男爵今日可抵巴黎、卽將會晤法總里、法英意三國代表將如豫定日期於星期五日開始正式談話、昨晚賴伐爾曾與駐巴黎之希臘公使波列蒂斯會談、按波氏已被聘為審查華爾華爾爭案調解委員會之第五仲裁員、該委員會前因雙方意見參差而停頓、今復繼續其工作矣、（十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>意代表抵巴黎　當即晤賴伐爾外長</h3>
<p>（巴黎）意大利代表阿洛亞西率同隨從人員於本日上午九時三十五分自意國抵此、參加英法意三國會議、阿洛亞西嗣於上午十一時赴外交部會晤法國總理兼外長賴伐爾、談話至十二時二十分始畢、（十五日哈瓦斯）</p>
<p>（巴黎）意總代表阿洛錫今晨抵此、旋往晤法總理賴伐爾、談一小時、又一刻鐘之久、當時無他人參加、談話內容未悉、法總理後告新聞記者、三强會議明日開始、賴氏將於今日午後再與英代表艾登晤談、（十五日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）據吟瓦斯社探悉、意國代表阿洛亞西、今晨與總理兼外長賴伐爾舉行談話時、曾竭力辯護意國之主張、謂意國因人口增多、在本國不能容納、故須在阿國獲得政治優惠、且為防衛意屬索謀里與愛利特里亞起見、亦有獲得此種政治優惠之必要、若僅獲得經濟優惠、實未能　足、意大利現已派遣陸軍十七萬入、集中東菲屬地、倘不能獲得滿意之和平解决、則準備隨時以武力干涉、至於意國解决爭端之要求範圍、則當俟明日三國會議開會後、方可提出、且昨日意國又動員陸軍五萬人、意國抱定决心、支持其原來主張、於此可見云、賴伐爾現將以阿洛亞西此項陳述、於午後報吿英國不管部大臣艾登、意國旣表示須獲得政治優惠、而英國則反對政治讓步、兩國主張、顯然背道而馳、一般人相信賴伐爾將調和英意兩國意見、另覓折衷辦法、主張和平解决意阿爭端、而予意國以實質的利益云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）半官式之「外交事務報」評論意阿爭端、謂『以紅海出海口畀予阿國也、限制阿國之經濟讓予權也、由國聯會委任統治也、凡此均屬用以掩飾英國在阿比西尼亞之代管權、今欲使意阿爭端妥協解决、則必捨棄以上各種方式而後可』、該報又謂意國雖承認由條約所產生之英國權利、然意國殊不願以意大利人之血、作擴大英帝國之代價、該報繼又縷舉英國方面對意缺欠友誼之種種行動、如唆使阿國動員軍隊也、以封鎖蘇彝士運河相威脅也、增加阿國附近英國屬地之駐防軍隊也、該報謂「英國所以不願意國勢力深入阿國、則以苟有機會可乘、英國卽將囊括阿國而佔有之也、英國用意在使意國一貧如洗、俾意國所需原料品、不得不仰給於英帝國、然意國對於此種威脅、並不畏懼、回憶一百零五年前、當法國遠征菲洲阿耳日里時、英國亦作類似之煽動、可見此乃英國之慣技、吾人亦何所憚哉」云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>意阿兩國　仍有軍事行動</h3>
<p>（羅馬）首相墨索里尼頃已核准僑居國外之意大利人組織志願黑衫隊、開往東菲、此項隊伍共計四營、每營一千人、由國外意大利人協會領袖巴利尼統帶、截至自前為止、全球各處意國僑民志願從軍者已有一萬一千人之多、惟因醫學檢騐甚為認眞、故正式編成隊伍者僅有四千人云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）墨索里尼首相已徵集一九一一年一九一三年及一九一四年三級後備兵二十萬人、該三級兵士以前已免服役、惟是否將開赴菲洲則未經發表、（十四日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）據此間接得阿比西尼亞京城電訊、阿比西尼亞政府昨日以大批軍械子彈運往哈拉爾省、尙有大批軍火、將陸續運往、阿國皇帝命令各省省長呈報所必需之軍需品數額、又集中阿國北部邊界之兵士、已達四十五萬人、均枕戈備戰、昨日並有大批機關槍自日本運到、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（柏林）國社黨機關報民衆觀察報、頃發表關於猶太人之統計、謂「居住德國之猶太人、其三分之一寄居柏林、德國全境共有猶太人四九九、六八二名、其中居住柏林者約佔柏林全城人口百分之四、其比率僅之於佛朗克孚城、緣佛朗克孚城為著名之猶太城、猶太人約佔全城人口百分之五、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）浮登堡政治警察當局、頃下令將勒勃朗·奈卡蘇·巴林根·及埃邦根等處之天主教靑年團體槪行解散、並禁止再有此項組織、此舉理由、係因該團體中若干團員、曾對國社黨靑年團團員動手毆擊云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （謝仲文）</p>
<p>只要聰明與傻氣使用得當，聰明人和優子便都是世界上可崇敬的人。</p>
<p>聰明教人節力省時以克服困難，優氣教人堅持猛進以克服困難。</p>
<p>聰明人的智慧，傻子的勇敢，同樣是創造萬類的泉源。</p>
<p>只要聰明與傻氣使用不得當，聰明人和優子便都是世界上可唾棄的人。</p>
<p>聰明只是作奸取巧的技倆，傻氣只是强行蠻幹的興奮劑。</p>
<p>而聰明人的詭譎，傻子的蠻橫，便同樣變成搗亂社會的因素。</p>
<p>我們需要的是聰明人的智慧而不是他的詭譎，是傻子的勇敢而不是他的蠻橫。</p>
<p>然而社會上只見詭譎害人的聰明人，不見勇敢肯吃虧的傻子！</p>
<h3>補記王均卿事</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>吳興詞人王均卿歸道山，予已為文以悼之，顧猶有未盡者，遂再記之於此。</p>
<p>詞人之築日辛獎於吳門也，移居之先，囑予紹介諸星社友，以為他日文酒之懽，不料有無賴少年，冒社兄金季鶴名，向詞人乞貸，詞人慨假若干金，致書述少年之狀態，詢予是否季鶴其人，予得書大詫，以季鶴頎然身長，神情瀟灑，絕不類書中所述之寒酸也，季鶴知之，更約詞人於某酒家以辨誣，且有認明長人為記，庶不　誤等語，此一齣雙包案，儕輩傳為趣談。</p>
<p>予識詞人於數年前，一見如故，交訂忘年，其時予適遭一二八之難，家室蕩然，而一片牢愁，洩諸楮墨。詞人因以懇摯之詞為慰曰：「如有急需，不妨見吿，當量力以為濟助也。」予婉謝之，然其盛情殊可感銘已。</p>
<p>詞人於民國初元，嘗發願輯　彤史，藉以增輝女界。如秋瑾華吟梅等，均收入其中。奈以某種關係，未能成為事實，甚可惜也。</p>
<p>中委褚民誼幼受詞人少訓誨，始終以師禮敬事之。說者以汪兆銘之於朱疆村，于右老之於沈兼巢媲美之。顧詞人從不有所委托，蓋襟懷冲淡，絕無些子利祿之想也。</p>
<p>詞人與程宗伊太史善。太史聞詞人噩耗，挽以二律，承太史囑代發表爰錄之以殿我文：「頓塘一見便心傾，風雨吳中訃乍驚，邀我無緣虛榻設，（君屢次請蒞蘇州）校警有術點金成，（君以編書起家）香山望子渾忘老，范式論交敢負生，勝有書碑辜宿諾（君重修明季黃九烟進士墓撰碑記屬書因濕氣纒繞兩掌未果）天涯流涕答君平。曙後星孤思悄然，飄零著作劇堪憐，咀含詩味雲崧集，（滬嘗謂詩學甌北）抉擇文心惜抱編。（謂評註姚選古文辭類纂）水竹平分軒面圃。滄桑不變硯為田。胡圖塚傍要離葬，猶有英風憶昔年。」詞人之梗槪，亦不難於詩中見之也。</p>
<h3>下他一番功夫</h3>
<p>— 涓隱</p>
<h3>談談脚尖舞</h3>
<p>— 憶秋</p>
<p>「舞蹈可以美化女子的一切姿態和動作，」記得曾有一位美術家這樣說過，在下從事歌舞界多年，從經歷中證明了這見解的確切。</p>
<p>脚尖舞是舞蹈藝術的最高峯，更可以使人婀娜多姿，因為這種舞蹈是富於彈性的，可以使任何笨重呆木的女子，變成了輕盈飄逸的美人。但是，在中國，眞正能够跳脚尖舞的人，嚴格點講，僅龔秋霞，潘文娟兩人。</p>
<p>有些表演魔術技擊的江湖班子裏，他們在開演的時候，也有一二個小姑娘出來跳脚尖舞，但那種僅提起了脚跟，前趾完全着地的躍動，絕對不能稱為脚尖舞。</p>
<p>在外國，用脚尖來舞是很平常的一伴事，一般的舞蹈，都是用脚尖步法來組合的。但是，在各種藝術都貧乏得可憐的中國—舞蹈當然不能例外！脚尖舞是着實覺得名貴了。</p>
<p>據魏縈波女士說：脚尖舞人才稀少的原因是，中國的歌舞從業員缺乏堅苦心，因為，用脚尖在舞台上跳上十來分鐘的玩藝兒，不是輕易可以得來，必須經過一番堅苦的功夫才得成功的。</p>
<p>龔秋霞女士已嫁了人，脫離歌舞界多年，僅潘文娟女士尙在邁進不已，現正獻藝南洋，聞華僑觀衆對潘女土之脚尖舞深致驚佩，熱烈歡迎，各地報紙均為潘女士出特刋，譽為中國眞才實藝的「歌舞聖手」，可謂紅極一時。據歌舞界某君云；中國歌舞在南洋，以團體論當推梅花之聲譽最隆，但以個人相比較，則潘文娟女士為最紅也。由此可知，眞眞的榮譽，不是偶然可以得來的，甚望一般歌舞女演員，切勿再存僥倖心，以為學會了幾個媚眼，笑功，就算了不起了。須知不久的將來，只有騷功夫，沒有眞本領的姑娘們都要自然的淘汰了。</p>
<h3>藕齋寓趣</h3>
<p>— （沈瘦若）</p>
<p>雲間名士楊幾園先生了公在日，襟懷曠達，風流　灑。嘗賞廡黃浦灘頭，比隣都有操神女生涯者，先生恬然居之，不以藏垢納汚為憾。因榜其寓居曰「藕齋」，人或詢其命意所在，先生輒樂為說明。蓋先生自比萍藕之高潔，雖處汚泥而不染也，其寓意可謂趣矣。</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十七回　莫問女兒身難言隱痛爭看貴人臉共仰高風</p>
<p>帳房笑道；張先生眞細心，事先還練習了許多呢。介夫將大栂指一伸，昇了頭道：我的字，藍專員一抬眼就認得的。我歇了兩個多月沒有寫大字，筆力有些退回去了。明天藍專員到了，若是說起字是我寫的，他見我的字寫回去了，我一定要受申斥的。有道是不怕官，只怕管，誰讓我的官此他小呢，那帳房聽他說出這種話來，更覺他和藍專員有了密切的關係，於是伺候他寫完了標語，立刻到前面店堂裏去宣傳，說是怪不得後院住的那位張先生，他要寫標語歡迎藍專員了，原來他就是藍專員手下的屬員呢，前天倒不該開了帳單子和他要錢。不過帳單子已經開過去，他還沒有給錢，以後對他放鬆一點就是了。論到小西天這旅館，是常常住着高級官吏的，來一個闊一點的人，倒算不了什麼，不過這次藍專員來，似乎他自己就宣傳了一陣，由南到北的報紙，都已登載過，西安本地的報，自然也是登載着的。有知識的人，覺得這不過是二三等要人，並不十分注意。這帳房先生，究竟對作官還是外行經不得介夫一再的說，他是中央大員。平常來了中央大員，都住在省城唯一的華貴招待所，新城大。這次大員來，不住新城夭樓要住旅館，他也像包文正私訪，要來查民間善亞的，倒是恭維一點的好。（二九一）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>伊的聲音說得非常的低，而且有些發抖，想必是因為伊此刻，已瞧得太高興了的緣故；人在太高與的時候，心是往往會顫的。</p>
<p>「讓我們趕快去把那幾朶淡緣色的探了下來，」太后又說道；「在我們未用早膳之前，儘先把它們用淨瓶盛起來供，到觀音菩薩的座前去。像這樣罕見的奇花，理該先去供菩薩！</p>
<p>太后對於觀音菩薩原是供奉得很虔誠的，我自已也頗有相當的信仰，可是此刻我的腦神筋上，却依舊在惦記那被發往黑龍江去的巡撫，因此不曾注意到這一點；但後來我决心擲開這椿煩惱的事情，儘一心瞧着那些奉了太后諭旨去採摘荷花的太監，駕着小舟，在荷叢中往來摘取。太后還不時叫人高聲傳話過去，這樣那樣的指點他們。在我們回宮之前，除掉供菩薩的綠荷之外，尋常的粉紅色的荷花也探滿了好幾筐，太后今天眞是得意極了！</p>
<p>第三十二章　太后的梳妝臺</p>
<p>遠在歐美人士以化裝術眩耀當世之前，我們的皇太后，已早就很透澈地發明了許多美容的秘訣，有幾種到如今可說還不曾給人家發現咧！所以我在當時就確認每次早朝之前，隨着太后上伊的梳洗室中去瞧伊慢條廝理的化裝起來，委實是等於去上一課「美容術」，而且是每次都能給我們得到新的體騐，决不會讓我們白白地站上半天的；因為伊老人家對於面部化裝的一件工程，始終是十二分小心地從事着的。（三九一）</p>
<p>短篇小説</p>
<h3>新生</h3>
<p>— 吳雅非</p>
<p>突然地，接到了明的一封信，他吿訴我，他現在已經到了長沙，在長沙一個農村實騐中學裏當訓育主任，他說：　—我對於教育界雖已灰心，教育飯也委實吃得有些厭倦了，然而我自己對自己也覺到有些懷疑；現在終於又給捲入了教育的漩渦里。如果是普通的中學呢，我或許會决心不願意幹的，但這是農村實騐中學，所以我情願犧牲了自已的主義，來做一個農村教育的拓荒者…</p>
<p>明是一個十足的抱消極主義者，開出口來總是一派消沉語氣，什麼悲哀，什麼煩惱！常常在他嘴角上掛着，而日常也不輕易看得見他一絲笑容的。平日他總整天躱在家裏，研究他的人生哲學：所以我雖和他是同學，而且也是同鄉，然而因為和他性情各異的緣故，彼此也就落落，但是比較其他朋友却是知巳得多了。</p>
<p>我雖反對他的消極主義，但却很了解他的苦衷，有時也剴切的勸解他一番，或安慰他一番，縱不能减少他的悲哀和煩惱的成分，可是他却也可以引我為知已的。</p>
<p>「菲，我生平知我者祗你一人而已！你纔算我的眞知己，除了你之外，便沒有第二個人了！就是父母兄弟，他們都不能了解我的！」他時常這麼對我說。</p>
<p>「明，做人原不過遊戲人間，過一天算一天，心裏要做的事便應當去做，不願做的事可不必去做，你何必這樣認眞？你也未免太會自苦了！原來天地間那會有完全稱心之事，完全愉快之人？」我總時常這樣的勸慰他。</p>
<p>他實自殺過三次，都為他家人設法救住的；我為了他的自殺，却不曾同情過他，反而着着實實地埋怨了他幾頓。後來他自已也彷彿有些覺悟了，所以每逢到我去埋怨他，他總對我表示着無限的慚愧！</p>
<p>「為人要勇敢，愈受磨折，其志愈堅，尤其是一個靑年，不應該氣餒，需要努力奮鬥，去剷除前面的障礙！」</p>
<p>眞的，他現在是轉變了，這一轉變，使他成了一個簇新的有志靑年；從他以前苦悶的網裏掙札了去來，去我取他的新生命了。他最近轉變的原因是：他近來有一位比我更了解他的愛人在鼓勵他，使他這顆將萎的心靈又活躍起來了。</p>
<p>上月，他由於那位愛人的慫恿，故離開了上海，同伊一起到了長沙去，做他們農村教育的拓荒者了；同時，更是他們純愛的幸福生活的開始。</p>
<p>當我得到這個喜訊的時候，該是怎樣的欣慰呵！</p>
<p>「他新生了，我們明的生命有了寄託了，這新人的靈魂有了歸宿了」！我不禁這樣默默地念着。</p>

<h3>小男兒（十六）</h3>
<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄（宗海）譯</p>
<p>龐韜摩做那進攻隊的前鋒，柏小橋固守他自己的房間，其勇敢與堅忍，殊足令人敬羨。他同時將丢來的枕頭隨到隨拾，直至圍攻的人軍火已竭，於是他們又復集隊前來，向他猛襲，來恢復他們旣失的兵器。雙方略有徵傷，然而大家均不在意，各以十分不打緊的神氣，去施予或接受振振有聲的拍擊，同時枕頭飛得竟如雪片一般，直到裴夫人看看她的錶喊道：</p>
<p>「時候已經到了，童子們，進床裏去，大大小小，要不然便當受罰。」</p>
<p>「什麼罰呢？』乃德問道，他坐着，急切想知道敢有不遵從這位最奇怪而又最熱心公益的女教師的，便該怎麼辦。</p>
<p>「下次便沒得玩。」裴夫人回答道。「我給他們五分鐘的時間去　下來，然後將火熄滅，那時秩序便得恢復了。他們是有名譽心的孩子，他們能守着他們的約言的。」</p>
<p>這確是巳分明了的。因為那秤戰鬥的停止正如興起時一般敏捷，—一二辭別的丢擲，一次最後的歡呼，—當小橋對着那退却的敵人，放着第七個枕頭的時候，—幾句看下次再比的豪語，然後秩序已完令恢復；惟有一些嗤嗤的笑聲與　　的低語，間或打破此喧開笑樂後的沉寂，裴夫人於是一吻她的新識實子，儘讓他去做梅莊生活的各種好夢了。</p>

<h3>紗花　標金跌風波及紗花　日人估計本年我全國棉產量銳減</h3>
<p>紗市上日大漲之後、今則反動、　起跌風、此種情形、完全受金潮打擊、多數心理、因美國對於白銀停購、預料銀市大跌標金必漲、昨日詎料反之、忽然下落、目跌勢狂暴、於是多頭大爲失望、市盤乃直綫下降、但現紗　帮顯現發展、不過其他帮口、尚無動辦氣象、</p>
<p>金雞多頭紛起出龍</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤前、羣衆因白銀趨縮、金價當長、毛盤　做達九百二十二元、未幾因大戶出籠、回跌迅速、致極紗開盤、各月一致下瀉、且跌風猛烈、因標金暴落、致浮　。神恍惚、斬結者頗不乏人、市盤愈難支持、　證劵帮努力購進、賴以維持、然時潮流洶湧、獨力難擋，二三盤仍弱、迨至收盤、聞上日蜀　現紗交易有一千四百五十包、人氣略振、回上五角、結果各月比上日收盤似均跌一元六七·八·角、午後開槃、形勢仍軟、內標金仍在低峰盤旋、但塲中成交不旺、結果本月比上午收盤價漲二角、餘月均跌一·二·三·四角、大阪三品紗漲一元六角至二元一角、查賣出梅記一千六百包、裕康四百五十包、大豐六百五十包、賡豐一千二百包、長餘六百包、元一一千五百包、長豐一千二百五十包、潤康一千八百五十包、信誠一千〇五十包、德記五百包、義成六百包、貿進吉豐五百包、益大二千二百五十包、裕大一千三百五十包、源大五百五十包、錦昌二千六百五十包、森康七百五十包、泰昌一千九百五十包、協成四百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<p>四川　一、四五〇　天津　五　廣東　六〇</p>

<p>棉市　疲、跌風亦熾、因標金猛跌三十元、最多頭失望、大起了結、以最　血鬆濫、市盤反動下墮、惟八月期多頭意態殊强、拉提頗急、跌勢較綏耳、據日人方而估計、本年我全國棉產佔計、約九百六十萬擔、較央年之一千零六十四萬　、减少一百零四萬擔云、</p>
<p>新花浮多失望</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、各月均趨下　、形勢異常虛弱、因上日多數預料、標金看漲、詎料狂跌、直低破進九百元大關、於是浮戶又現不安、市盤乃步步下落、　益虛、結果本月比上日收盤價僅跌一角、遠跌二角半至四角半、午後開盤、聞標金仍在低峯盤旋故賣者尚不乏人、遠月新棉突跌三角、打至二三盤略漲一二角、收盤尚平靜、惟大戶之多頭、尙鎭靜不動、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌一角至二角半、查賣出賡豐五千九百擔、梅記二千擔、大福一千二百擔、森康一千六百擔、同豐七千九百擔、長豐一千八百擔、潤康二千六百擔、源興昌三千擔、瑞大二千七百擔、長和二千擔、買進均昶二千擔、大孚二千四百擔、大豐一千一百擔、　昌一千三百擔、義成二千擔、泰昌五千七百擔、恒昌二千擔、信誠三千九百擔、大昶一千一百擔、益康一千四百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>糧食　麫粉廠商補近出遠</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、初居挺站、旋即銳落、惟本月份始終堅站、因現粉客化仍有零星去路、各廠存底均枯、大廠已經在市收補本月期、廠方對於本月雖有收進、但於遠月反有售出、市面乃見近堅遠平之局、繼以金價回跌、囤買觀望、廠方繼出、除本月份因現粉缺乏帶住外、餘月一致跌落、收市價九月小一分二五、十月小一分半、十一十二月各小一分七五、一月小一分二五、本月祇小二厘半云、</p>
<h3>麥市隨金價鋭落</h3>
<p>昨日麥市、晨盤開市以後、各月份立即趨下、午後開價更見逐步跌落、因金價在前日飛騰後、　日突降二三十元、業內外國戶進意巳淡、浮多新興新空頗有拋出、兼之業外囤戶向以洋麥與金價為趨向、今洋麥電訊雖漲、而金濟突落、匯水放長、倘再度狂跌、則定貨即可接近、囤胃呆、市即下趨、多頭回出、價即銳落、收市價八化月各小五分、十月小三分、十一月小四分、十二月小三分、現麥存到兩少、貨主繼續喊大、　廠方意在　小、以致全市停頓、由產地高昂、一時終不易壓</p>
<h3>食米去路昨又冷淡</h3>
<p>本業（滬南）昨日各　來源忽又稍多、計到二十餘號、（貨共四千餘石、）故人心　而銷塲續滯、包胃仍祇靑島等　辦四五百包大局形勢難以振作、市色再見貶跌、各厚粳及薄稻行情、悉落一二角不等、惟浦東新粳、以前朝連日天雨貨稀、續呈定局、而陰變元及　尖等各花色、俱無上落、（滬北）來源十四·五號、市上各貨去胃白粳依然呆滯、價疲數分至近角　薄稻去貨平常、價形疲勢、東新粳到六·七百石零化尙稱不惡、巿價定局、白允到銷兩平、價無榮辱、新客尖車運乏到、零拆續化、市形平定、其餘略軟、</p>
<p>洋米昨市更形軟弱、因日來甬秈一再裝到外皖秈亦由火車接連裝到、洋米存底雖少、而客化去胃日淡、昨泉州與北帮均已停辦、內地與甬帮略辦中次貨與碎米等、本街胃口均宏、但有新秈軋脚、因此各米一律跌去一角及五六分不等、甬秈到數雖微、市亦步下、全市開出西貢四千五百包、暹邏小絞高貢等一千八百包、甬秈三百多包、多數爲本街辦去云、</p>

<p>「朕早夜勤毖，研求治理，念生民之本，以衣食為天。嘗讀豳風無逸諸篇，其言稼穡蠶桑，緘悉具備，昔人以此被之管弦，制於典誥；有天下家國者，洵不可不留運三復於其際也。西漢詔令，最為近古，其言曰：『農事傷，則餓之本也；女紅害，則寒之原也。』又曰『老耆以壽終，幼孤得遂長。』欲臻斯理者，舍本務其曷以成。朕每巡省風謠，樂觀農事，於南北土疆之性，黍稼播種之宜，節候早晚之殊，蝗蝻捕治之法，素畫咨詢，知此甚晰。聽政時恒與諸臣工言之，於豐津園之側，治田數畦，環以溪水。阡陌井然在目，桔橰之聲盈耳，歲收嘉禾數千緟。隴畔樹桑，飭置蠶舍，絡繭繅絲，恍然加鄰簷蔀屋。因構知稼軒秋雲齋以臨觀之。古人有言：「衣帛當思織女之寒，食粟當念農夫之苦，」朕捲捲於此，至深且切也。爰繪耕織圖各二十三幅，朕於每幅製詩一章，以明論其勤苦，而出之於圖，自始事至終事，農人胼手胝足之勞；蠶女繭絲機秄之瘁咸備；極其情狀，復命鏤板流傳，用以昭子孫臣庶俾知粒食維艱，授衣非易……』</p>
<p>這序眞可謂做得體面之至。所以我把它抄了一大段。其中最使我們注意的，還是他能治幾畝田地，種幾吐桑樹，構些子蠶舍，親自來觀賞耕織以表示關心農事。可是四十六幅圖中，每幅的布景和人物的安排，都極其細密工緻。耕圖二十三幅為：浸種，耕，耙耨，耖，碌　，布秧，初秧，淤蔭，拔秧，挿秧，一耘，二耘，三耘，灌溉，收刈，登塲，持穗，春碓，麗，簸揚，磐，入　，祭神。織圖二十三幅，為：浴蠶，二眠，三眠，大起，捉績，分箔，採桑，上簇，炙箔，下簇，擇繭，窖繭，練絲，蠶蛾，祀謝，緯，織，絡絲，經，染色，攀華，剪帛，成衣，—雖則這種農事和蠶事的生產過程，是不錯的；但每幅的畫出，都太美化了。把鄕村畫成個詩的境界，幽閒而謐美。同樣，單就耕圖說，每一個農夫，都軟脚軟手的，有付豐滿的臉，淸麗的鬚眉，全像個文雅的紳士。如布秧一圖，二個農夫各提着一個籮筐，邊笑邊談，緩綏地把手里穀子，像餧鷄似的散下田去，彷彿有無限的工作樂趣。這無疑是歪曲了現實。就我所見的說，農人布秧時，是播那麼的，用勁地把穀子散成一田面一田面的，决沒有那麼邊散邊談的閒逸神情。然而正因為有這閒逸神情，却就適合皇帝御目了。要不然，作者眞的畫出個粗里粗氣使勁播穀的農人出來，那也許會便皇帝看了不快的。</p>
<p>又如在三耘，灌漑時，那正是大暑天氣，鄕下農夫大都是赤膊工作的。但在這里也還是衣服整然沒一個裸體的人。裸體那自然有穢凟御目之處了。雖然是事實，却還不得不加以掩蔽。能掩蔽，則能使皇帝看了高興，發得出詩興來，每首題得下詩去。雖然詩是極拙劣，但皇帝那份高興却顯然的，你看他那初秧一幅的題詩吧。</p>
<p>「春工正當時，下種看期度；乘閒携子遊，策杖臨堭路；看水汛西湖，臨風方日暮；農家事可知，應費心無數。」這里，雖然在末一句帶了一筆農事勞苦的話，但全首詩却畫出了農人快樂的情形—而皇帝彷彿也在這快樂中分得一份歡喜了。</p>
<p>其實，在這二十三幅耕圖裏，沒一幅不充滿了快樂，和諧的神情。—地主對於農人的和靄，農人與農人間的親密；以及娘兒們和孩子們的高興，全覺得這日子是過得和平而愉快的。—眞是一個和平而愉快的農村呵！於是天下也就昇平了，所謂藝術作為昇平的點綴的能事也盡了。</p>
<p>但現實總不容許作者過分掩蔽眞實的，藝術作品，應該是從現實生活里眞切地體騐而得的成果，才能偉大。如其把藝術作品，作為宮廷的奉仕之一，且用以粉飾太平，那麼作者底思想感情，是必須以宮廷里主人底思想感情為準則，對於現實不過是借取些材料，來利用一下吧了。因此發生了內容與形式的矛盾。如在這里將農村粗野的生活內容，表現成為優婉和柔的筆調，把藝術從現實游離開來。雖然皇帝看了，頗有心得；但呌農人自己來看，怕會疑心這是另一世界另一人間的事了。</p>
<h3>峽中行（下）</h3>
<p>— 方鄔</p>
<p>我便吿訴他，這原是不得巳的事情，因為在那些山里走路，若不自稱是做生意的，別人就不願意和你同路走，話也不高興和你講的。</p>
<p>「那末，你到底是做啥子的？」</p>
<p>「我麼，肚子逼我走路，只要能够活下去，都要作下去的人哪！</p>
<p>「喔！」</p>
<p>那位漢子便把腦袋歪着，對着我的旅伴譏刺地笑了起來。</p>
<p>「你簡直倒給人騙着了！……還呌你去騙啥子人，回家去看你的牛吧！」</p>
<p>我的旅伴頹然地坐在地上，也不開腔，也不回答，只是把嘴上的旱烟管叭得咬吱地發響。</p>
<p>這時覺得我的危險業已過去，我可以自由地走我的路了。但那漢子忽地拍一下大腿，向我呌道：</p>
<p>「好傢伙，你有本事騙着他，那你同我們一道吧：你又是不論啥子事，都願意作的。」</p>
<p>接着，忽然想起了什麼東西似的，抓着我的肩頭，猛力搖了兩搖，瞇小右眼，睜大左眼，像要看透人家的肺腑一樣地釘着我，大聲問道：</p>
<p>「你到底是怎樣跑到外面來的？吿訴我，老老實實地吿訴我！是不是像他一樣（指一下我的旅伴）拿鋤頭打傷了主人家呢？…吿訴我，你得老老實實地吿訴我！」</p>
<p>我搖搖頭，說我並不是這樣的。他挺一挺眉毛，現出深思的神情，低聲自言自語道：</p>
<p>「唔，是一隻還有窩巢的鳥兒哩」。</p>
<p>隨即現出决斷而靈活的樣子，對我揮一揮手，詼諧地向我說道：</p>
<p>「朋友，還是走你的路吧，祝福你，一路發財！」</p>
<p>到這時我才鬆爽地透了一口氣，好像立刻從水里鑽出頭的一般。等我提着包袱，向前走了一二十步的時候，那漢子驀地在後面大聲地呌道：</p>
<p>「喂，轉來！轉來！」</p>
<p>我吃驚了了但却不能不依從地走了回去。</p>
<p>我抱着由他擺佈的惴惴心情，走到他的面前，他這時已經盤着腿坐在大石上面了，嘴角上吊着吸了大半節的　烟捲，仍舊現出先前那種悠然自得的神情。他用手指一指他的對面，諷刺地笑着道：</p>
<p>「不要怕，坐下吧…，剛才還會過，現在應該是老朋友了。」</p>
<p>我不由得坐了下去，包袱却依然躭在背上。</p>
<p>「丟開你的爛包袱把！…唔，那樣寳貴着，一定還有一點…」</p>
<p>我只得把牠取下，心禁不住跳了起來，想道：</p>
<p>「這傢伙又要幹啥子哪！」</p>
<p>同時用眼睛偷偷瞟那鄕下人，他正彎着身子，朝迎春柳下面的草叢中，仲長着手腕在摸着什麼東西。</p>
<p>我面前的漢子呢，已把嘴上的烟枝摘來丟到江裏去了，現出不能等待的氣色，連聲催促着。</p>
<p>「快點快點，……你總是那樣慢！」</p>
<p>我的身上，有點冒出毛毛汗來了。</p>
<p>不久東西取來了，是一個包袱。那漢子一手抓過去，很快地就把牠打開，乾牛肉和乾麵餅的香味，馬上升騰起來。他一面喊着「吃吧」，便把一塊乾牛肉，撕來塞進嘴裏去。</p>
<p>我猶豫着。那位鄕下人却蹲在我傍邊，饕餮地大吃起來，彷彿昨天就沒吃過飯似的。</p>
<p>「吃呀，你獃痴痴的做啥子？……傻瓜麼？」</p>
<p>那位漢子把一塊牛　塞在我的手上，見我不敢接的樣子，就實備道：</p>
<p>「你不餓麼？吃呀　」</p>
<p>我紅着臉，口吃地說道：</p>
<p>「不要……不要同我開玩笑，我可付不起這頓飯的賬呀」</p>
<p>「扯，不要那樣傻！付得起，可就不要你吃了！」</p>
<p>漢子略帶生氣的樣子說，一面把掛在牙縫裏面的筋絲拉了出來，丟下江去．</p>
<p>吃飽了的時候，那漢子便向我笑着說道：</p>
<p>「老朋友，你可以動身哪！我們也要走了！」</p>
<p>跟着又莊重地吩咐道：</p>
<p>「一直走，可不要回頭看哪！……你可知道，我們說一句，算一句的！」、</p>
<p>我懂得這批人的規矩，說話就是法律，眞的，我頭也不回地便繞着山坡走了。</p>
<p>江聲一路荷荷地吼着，不斷地噴吐着白色的泡沫，彷彿一羣頑皮小學生，已從嚴格的學校裹放了出來，歡笑得發狂的樣子。</p>
<p>翡翠鳥在水上迅速地掠着，時而挨近了我走的路邊，時而又飛得遠遠的。野鴨拍着麻褐色的翅子，歡喜地呌着，三三五五地飛了起來，又三三五五地浮在水上追逐。</p>
<p>開着黃色小花朶的迎春柳，和一些麻柳樹的枝葉在颯颯吹着的江風裏，欣然地飄搖着，抖動着。</p>
<p>我飽吸着峽裹嫩凉的新鮮空氣，吹着口哨兒愉快地走着。</p>
<h3>投宿</h3>
<p>— 時玳</p>
<p>—齊東山野小景之一—</p>
<p>西沉的太陽含羞的漲紅着臉兒，向虎口山西坡躱藏，靑翠的山頭在夕陽光照不，格外顯得幽靜而肥胖了。披着密葉的柞　，高高地參出松林，探頭遙望着天際的晚　，細長的影子寂然無聲的按摩着松枝。松　暗淡了，模糊　落在士丘般的石硼上，漸漸地减退了顏色。</p>
<p>遠谷傳來陣陣牧雷聲，一忽兒雖給送晚的禪聲淹沒了。</p>
<p>「歇會兒再走吧！我實在累得要死！」</p>
<p>「眼看天就黑了，爽性我們走到山腰那座廟前在歇息好不好？說不定那兒就是娘娘廟呢？」珊姐指着西邊撇　山半坡的廟宇說。</p>
<p>「對了，到那里我們還可找宿呢！」</p>
<p>疲乏急激的燃燒着，拚着最後的氣力的殘餘，我們好容易轉過呌馿嶺，跨過一道深谷，崎嶇的山道倒臥在我們脚下，一不留神就給石塊碰一下子，或是踏蹭了石頭給跌一交。璇姐不時嘟嚕着，抱怨「何不該在石榴噇僱牲口騎」我跟珊姐却忍耐着不言也不語。</p>
<p>趕到廟前的碑座上坐下時，黃昏已在收縮它的淡影，我跑到廟跟前仰頭看那紅漆金字匾，果然是「娘娘廟」三字。愉悅像一朶含苞待放的夜來香一下子就掙開了花瓣，我老遠就喊：</p>
<p>「正是娘娘廟啊！」</p>
<p>彷彿疲乏畏懼了愉快，兩腿鷄毛似的輕飄，一溜風跑到碑前。我拍着璇姐的肩頭：</p>
<p>「我們不愁沒處宿了。」</p>
<p>我要去拍廟門，珊姐說不急。「等歇息過來呌門不遲，反正那尼姑看了三姑媽的信她不會不留咱們住宿！」死心塌地的歇乏吧，璇姐倒着鞋裏的沙子，我却被碑上一張小紅帖子吸引住了，我靠近仔細一看，上邊寫着：</p>
<p>「天皇皇地皇皇，我家有個哭夜郞</p>
<p>行路君子念三遍，一夜睡到大天亮。」</p>
<p>夜幕掩蓋了黃昏，暑熱也隨着羣山跌入黑暗的陷阱，鳴濺濺宛如寡婦夜　的石女河底流水，划破空氣的沉寂向山谷飄揚，草虫在深草叢中　　的敲擊翅膀，彷彿故意嚇我們探險似的旅行的女孩兒家。</p>
<p>「阿玳！去呌門吧！」</p>
<p>姐妹三個一齊走到廟階上，我用璇姐的手杖敲着門，裏邊的狗瘋狂的呌着跑來，爪抓着門檻狠命的咬，接着有人呵斥着狗。咆哮的狗呌停止了，門開處露出」位穿黑袈裟的尼姑，她的發光的臉上攤着詫異？眼光敏捷的打量着我們姐妹三個。</p>
<p>「師傳！貴處有位怡師傅嗎？」</p>
<p>「啊！啊……」</p>
<p>她躊躇着，顯然在懷疑着我們的來歷。</p>
<p>我見她那股勁兒，就忍不住急性的脾氣：</p>
<p>「我們也不是匪不是賊，你放心吧，我們姐妹三個都是打江南來的，全是學生子，請你吿訴我們怡師傳在不在這里？要不信我們還有介紹信！」</p>
<p>心直口直的人，幹嗎都得來個痛痛快快，阿姐都向我使眼色，不讓我再往下說什麼。</p>
<p>那老尼姑終於點頭讓我們進去。</p>
<p>黑暗籠罩了廟院，一切都是糢糊的，閃着光亮的眼睛底狗，在角落里汪汪的呌着。禪房靜悄悄的，微弱的燈光半晤不明的殘喘着，壁上的菩薩畫像幾乎給燈光遺忘了。</p>
<p>璇姐打開皮包把三姑媽的親筆信遞給那位老尼姑，她一看信皮的筆跡和署名就知道是她二十年前的老友時珂韻的信，她一邊拆信一邊笑嘻喀的對我們說：</p>
<p>「我就是靜怡。珂韻姐姐一向可好？」</p>
<p>「托師傳的福，姑媽平平安安。」</p>
<p>她讀完三姑媽的手書，就滿臉喀笑的招待我們，她進里屋把一個已經睡了覺的小小尼姑喊起來，她吩咐她生火燒水煮飯。</p>
<p>縱然疲憊在身上發酵，躺下去歇息是不可能的，怡師傳問長問短，姐妹三個總得用心的回答，講到三姑媽的身世，她便嘆息她自己的過去，做尼姑並非她的心願，她不是厭世主義者，更非逃避現實，不過是暫且借以安身而已，雖說現在是做了為娘娘廟的主持，但這種枯寂的生活一點不能引起她的興趣。</p>
<p>吃過飯時，夜益靜寂，山門深鎖着，遠遠山澗的瀑布嘩嘩的襲擊着溪流，呵欠催促我們早睡，當時我們躺下時，怡師傳却伏在燈下讀我們帶來的信了。</p>
<h3>海邊的悲劇（五）</h3>
<p>— 法國巴爾扎克原著王堅生譯</p>
<p>「你們曉得，我永記好這一切，柴勃拉梅也自然還記得」他在停了一會後說。</p>
<p>「當呷葵斯柴勃拉梅十五六歲的時候，他己是一個十足的小騙子。他常常出去愚弄人家，並且在居輪第和莎菲蘭地方靜候着。接着他就需要錢幣，因此從事去搶竊他的母親的，她不敢在丈夫面前露出一字，拉勃拉梅是一個誠實的男人，假使一個人在支票上多寫二個「蘇」雖然要趕跑二十里的路，也得如數歸還。」</p>
<p>「最後，一天當他的父親出外捕魚時，他的母親所有的東西都被搶刦一空；他們的兒子拿走了梳妝臺，陶器，被單，襯衣，他什麼也不給遺留一些，只賸下蕭蕭的四壁，他把所有席捲去的東西變賣後，獨自到蘭突斯暢飲去了。那可憐的婦人為着這件事日夜痛哭。當他的父親回來的時候，她要把這件事吿訴他，可是她畏懼着這孩子的父親——不是為了她自己——你們自然明白的！當辟銳柴勃拉梅回來後，他看見他家里陳設着他妻子借來的家具時，他說：「怎末一會事」？他的可憐的妻子眞是比死人多一口氣了，最後她說：「我們已經被搶刦一空了」。「呷葵斯到那兒去了」。「呷葵斯獨自去暢飲了」！沒有一個人知道這位亳無可取的活寳貝究竟潛逃到那兒去了。「他眞是太喜歡放蕩的了」！辟銳說：</p>
<p>「六個月以後，這位可憐的父親風聞他的兒子將被帶到蘭突斯城被審判。他步行到那里（步行比走海路還要近便，）找獲了他的兒子，把他帶回去。他並未問他「你犯了些什麼罪？」他只是說：「如果你不能和你的母親與我在一塊過活二年，行為端正，出外捕角為業，做一個誠實的人，你看我的顏色吧！」這位瘋狂的人，認為他的父母愚蠢，對他父親極力椰揄。因此辟銳在他頭邊重擊一下，使呷葵斯臥倒了六個月，同時那可憐的母親因憂傷而憔悴下去。</p>
<p>『一夜，正當她熟睡在她的丈夫的身旁，她聽見一陣囂聲，她從牀上爬起來，臂上給刺了一刀子。她哭喊起來，他們點了一個火，辟銳柴勃拉梅知道他的妻子是負傷了。他堅信着這一定是强盜—好像在我們這地方，眞有强盜似的。哎，你就是隨身携帶一萬金法郞從娜克羅亦錫克到聖那撒，不必担心有人問你帶些什麼東西。辟銳去尋找呷葵斯去了，但是到處也尋不到他的影蹤。翌日淸晨，小强盜眞的老了面皮地回來了，說他是住在拔突斯的。我應該先吿訴你，他的母親不知道她的錢應該寄存在什麼地方，柴勃拉梅把他的錢存到克羅亦錫克去和留蒲勒先生放在一起他們的兒子的惡作劇，耗費了好多金鎊，他們已經是一半傾家蕩產了，因為對於一個人有一萬二千「里佛爾」（法銀幣名）在身邊的人欲求揮霍自如，就有些難了。沒有一個人知道究竟柴勃拉梅在蘭突斯地方化了多少錢才把兒子贖回來。整個的家庭陷落在惡逆的命運中。柴勃拉梅的兄弟，也遭逢不幸，而求援助。為了要安慰他，辟銳吿訴他呷葵斯應當娶辟魯突為妻（辟魯突是柴勃拉梅兄弟的女孩兒，）於是帮助他謀生，他在捕魚時雇用他，約瑟·柴勃拉梅因為麵包問題也得屈身做苦工了。他的妻子巳患熱病而死，所以她必得付淸辟魯突斷乳中幾個月的工錢。辟銳柴勃拉梅的妻子為了鎮小孩，為了他的衣着，欠了人家一百法郞之多，又因替辟魯脫帶奶，欠了大福羅魯二三個月的工資，大福羅魯曾和西高德利養過一個孩子。柴勃拉梅的妻子在她的臥褥的羊毛中縫好一個西班牙金幣上面寫着「給辟魯突。」他曾經受過良好的敎育，她的字寫得和書記一樣的工整，她曾經敎他兒子讀書，就是這件事，使他破家。沒有人曉得這件事，但是大家曉得那位毫無可取的呷葵斯曾盜了金子，他拿到娜克羅亦錫拉克去胡調。</p>

<p>電信特刊</p>
<p>電界之聲</p>
<h3>行政院通令政軍機關繳納報話費</h3>
<p>— 楨</p>
<p>最近行政院以政軍警各機關，發寄電報，裝用電話，其應付報費話費，時有拖欠，如過新舊交替，新任接事之後，對於前任任內未付之報話費，往住藉詞推諉，不肯繳納，因此電政收和，日漸短少。特通飭各部會各省市政府並轉飭所屬，嗣後關於應付報費話費，務須按月繳納，遇有交替，前後任不得互相推諉，否則槪照報話局規章停止發報通話。此係行政院徇交通部之請，整頓報話欠費最有效之通令也。</p>
<p>夫電信乃國營事業，政軍機關爲國家機關，其和員爲公務人員，對於報話各費，應按定章繳付，毫無疑義，無待乎政府最三通吿者也。乃自軍興以來，政治未上軌道，政軍機關，濫發電報，濫裝電話，至所欠之費，無法淸償，而交通部每年因其所欠之費，不能收回，致各種改進與整理之計劃，均無法實行。交通部經濟上之損失，固已不貲，政軍機關不按定章發報裝話，繳付各費，事後又不遵政府功令，按月淸償，其道德上之損失，尤爲可惜者也。</p>
<p>近年國家多故，開支浩繁，政軍機關經費，未能十分充裕，吾人深所諒解。然試查政軍機關之預算决算中，每月若干之郵電費，固已赫然列和，此項郵電費，果能按月照付，自爲電政機關所歡迎，苟此固定之費，吝而不予，似不能以經費支絀爲政軍機關諒也。</p>
<p>查政軍機關所發之電報，事屬緊急者固多，事屬平常者，亦復不少。卽緊急電報中，故爲舖張者有之，過事冗長者有之，此之謂濫發電報，濫發以後，報費自必拖欠，拖欠以後，自難淸償。政軍機關，如能遵照蔣總司令二十一年十二月刪電「非萬難節省，不得長過一百字，非特急事件，不得濫加限卽刻到字樣，非緊急情事，尤應改用快郵，不應動輒發電」之規定，决無濫發電報情事，報費自可照付，决不至拖欠如今日之鉅。</p>
<p>至政軍機關新舊交替，係其內部情事，與電局無關，何得藉詞推諉，對於前任未付之報話費，不肯繳納。試問政軍機關如欠各機關或商店之欵項，能如此藉辭推諉乎？又各機關或商店如欠政軍機關之欵項，能如此藉辭推諉乎？明知不能如此推諉，而終於不肯繳納報話費者，因政軍機關狃於故習忽於功令之故，而電政機關懾於威權，疏於職責，對於政軍所欠報話費，不按月催收，亦爲主因焉。</p>
<p>今者行政院最有效之通令，旣經發出，嗣後政軍機關如不按月繳付應付之報話費，則電政機關，自可根據此令，停止發報通話，同時可呈報交通部轉呈行政院，對於該機關長官予以法律上應受之處分，電政機關經費有無整頓希望，在於政軍機關尊重此項功令與否而已。</p>
<h3>蕪湖米商與電局糾紛案的真相</h3>
<p>— 驊</p>
<p>前幾矢南京的中國日報和蕪湖的皖江及工商日報等，都登載着「蕪湖電報局遲送電報，被當地米商控訴法院，要求賠償損失」的新聞。案情是這樣的：安徽省政府在上年起，對於出境米糧，要徵取振米，在皖區各地設有徵取振糧辦事處，專司其事，後來該處奉省政府電令停徵，限期結束，可是當時因爲停徵的電報，被蕪湖電報局遲送了數小時，有幾家米商多繳振糧四百餘石，要求辦事處退還未果，所以米商認爲所蒙的損失，完全爲了電報遲送的緣故，特地聯合延請律師向蕪湖地方法院控訴電報局長過失罪，要求賠償。記者覺得蕪湖米商的損失，是否完全爲了電報遲送的緣故，固然尙有研究的餘地，但是停徵電報的遲送，旣是本案發生的主因，當然有首先檢討的必要。尤其在電報業務積極整頓聲中，發生了上面的不幸事件，更應該澈究其原因，與社會人士以共見。現在把記者探詢得到的延送原因，寫在下面，希望本刋讀者公正的指敎。</p>
<p>本來每張電報的收報地名，照章祇准有一處，若是有兩個收報地名，那末就是兩張電報，要納兩份報費，這個理由很簡單，因爲一張電報發到兩處，要費兩份的人工與材料，和兩張電文不同的電報，情形完全一樣。但是有些軍政機關所發的軍官電報，往往不受這種拘束，每份電報常有幾處或是十幾處的收報地名。電局在特殊情形之下，當然無法拒絕。不幸這次安徽省政府停收振糧的電報，就是因爲多處收報地名的混淆不淸，才發生延送的結果。原來皖省府停徵振糧電報的收報地名是這樣寫的：「蕪湖南京上新河送西梁山滁縣送陳家淺廣德送定埠明光送盱眙徵取振糧辦事處」，蕪湖電局當時以爲蕪湖南京兩地名之間，旣沒有收報人姓名住址和其他標識，認爲是「蕪湖南京上新河探送西梁山」，因爲蕪湖距西梁山僅三十餘里，而南京上新河距西梁山有一百二三十里之遙，並且平時發往西梁山電報，向來由蕪局專送，所以無疑地派差專送西梁山，後來經蕪局覆核人員研究的結果，覺得蕪湖本地或亦項抄送，故將電報重行檢出送往，但巳延擱了數小時的時間。所謂遲送的原因卽在此。</p>
<p>記者對於蕪湖米商這次重大的投失，表示十二分的同情，可是這種損失，果眞是電報遲送的原因嗎？安徽省府停徵振糧電報的內容，固然是局外人無從懸測，但是依常識判斷，一定有明白規定的期限，决不會說：「自電到之時起停徵」。况且徵取振糧的地方，並不是蕪湖一處，當然與省內各地受同等待遇，决不能使蕪湖一處獨受損失，這是要請蕪湖米商們認識淸楚，否則徒勞無功的。</p>
<p>聽說交部對於蕪湖局的延送電報，雖然有上而所述的原因，但是仍舊認爲是辦事人員疏忽，曾經把負責人員，加以相當的處分，並且竭力設法避免同樣事件的發生。至於蕪湖米商與電局涉訟是否合法，究竟電局應否負賠償的責任，法院自當根據交通部電報規則，秉公辦理，用不着記者多說了！</p>
<h3>敬告設置學術試騐電臺者</h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>自交通部在平律滬漢等處登報通吿，懸賞徵求密吿私設電臺以來，　密之函，紛至沓來，私設電臺之因而破獲者，爲數非尠。但其中設臺主旨，經查明純係試騐學術者，亦有數起，此其性質與一般私設電臺秘密通信者，迪然不同，自不能一概而論。</p>
<p>夫公私團體或個和爲供給學術上試騐之用而設置之電臺，本爲電信條例第三條第六欵所許可。交通當局且於上年七月有學術試騐無綫電臺設置規則之頒布，該項規則當時並曾周咨各關係機關及團體查照。故交通部對於學術試騐無綫電臺（以下簡稱試騐電臺）之設置，母寗謂爲具有監護與獎勵之旨。惟是項規則，施行迄今，轉瞬經年，各地試騐電臺之遵守規則聲請登記者固多，而因循觀望者仍復不少。交通當局對於此等未請登記之試騐電臺，自不負保雜之責，一旦經人吿發，查明屬實，爲維持法令威信計，自不能不斷然取締，執法以繩，深望設置試騐電臺諸君，迅行照章登記領照，母再猶豫徘徊，免蹈法網，俾可專心一志從事於無綫電學術之研究與試騐也。</p>
<p>至學術試騐無綫電臺設置規則計二十六條，頗爲完備。茲摘述其內容如次次，藉供關係方面之參考：</p>
<p>（甲）凡以研究無綫電信學術爲宗旨，專供試騐而設之收發無綫電信機器，稱爲學術無綫電臺。此項電臺凡國立火學學院，在國民政府教育機關立案之專門以上理工學校及理工科學學會等合法團體，以及從事於無綫電學術研究及改良，能在實際上有所貢獻之中華民國國民，經聲請交通部核准後，均可設置。聲請時應將下列各項詳細開明：（一）負責代表人及負責試騐人之姓名·履歷·地址：（此項人員遇有更動，應隨時報吿交通部，）（二）私立學校或學會之立案機關，及其立案年月；（三）電臺之名稱·地址·組織·槪算·及其機件來源，機件程式曁工程計劃等項。</p>
<p>（乙）試騐電臺之發信機發射電力，個人設置者，最大不得超過五十華脫；學會或國立暨私立專門以上學校設置者，最大不得超過一百華脫。所用電信機電波之週率，以左列規定者爲限，並應力求穩定，使與原定週率相差不過千分之二，並須避免多次波之發生：</p>
<p>（一）五六〇〇〇——六〇〇〇〇千週。（波長五·三五—五公尺）</p>
<p>（二）二八〇〇〇——三〇〇〇〇千週。（波長一〇·七—一〇公尺）</p>
<p>（三）一四〇〇〇——一四四〇〇千週（波長二一·四—二〇公尺）</p>
<p>（四）七〇〇〇——七三〇〇千週。（波長四二·八—四一公尺）</p>
<p>（五）三五〇〇——四〇〇〇千週。（波長八五—七五公尺）</p>
<p>（六）一七一五——二〇〇〇千週。（波長一七五—一五〇公尺）</p>
<p>（丙）試騐電臺應於呈准設置後六個月內裝置完竣，並開具機器程式，詳細接綫圖，發射電力，天綫最大電流及其高度，電波方式及其週率，通信方式與其通信電臺之地址·呼號·波上及電力，以及每日發射時間等，聲請交通部派員查騐，發給執照並爲指定呼號。上述各項經交部規定或核准後，不得自行變更。</p>
<p>（丁）試騐電臺除專供學術試騐之用外，不得作其他任何通信或廣播之用；並不得擾亂或妨礙陸海空軍通信，及國營或公衆通信機關之業務；對於其他電臺之通信亦不得截取，如屬於無意中取得，亦應絕對保守秘密，但遇有遇險呼吊時，不在此限。</p>
<p>（戊）試騐電臺如與其他電臺通信時，應依交通部所定學術試騐電臺通報紀錄表格式，詳細填註，按季彙寄交通部查考。並須將平時試騐成續於每年五月底及十一月底彙總報吿。</p>
<p>（己）交通部得隨時派員檢查電臺之機件·執照·及各項有關係之簿籍圖表，各電臺不得託故拒絕。如查有違反規則情事，得依情節之輕重，酌定期間，停止其試騐或撤消其執照，並得依照電信條例第二十一條之規定辦理。</p>
<p>上述六項爲該規則內容之簡括的叙述，讀者欲窺全豹，可逕函南京交通部電政司或本社索閱，當卽寄奉。</p>
<h3>新訂納費公電辦法之優點（續）</h3>
<p>— 葆眞</p>
<p>（四）發報人發出電報之後，如發覺電稿內尙有要言遺漏，或將電文某字誤繕，或誤譯者，或接到收報局發來查詢電文疑字之納費公電後，查明確係本人錯誤者，均可請求電局拍發納費公電通知收報局，補充電文或更正錯誤之字。此項納費公電，僅按請求人所請求之字付費。例如補充住址或電文二字，祇須付二字之報費，更正電文一字，僅須付一字之報費。較之向例應由發報人按全電所含字數納費，亦可减省一部份報費也</p>
<p>（五）發報人如因未知發出之電報，巳否送妥，發生疑慮，可往電局請求代發納費公電，查詢原電，係於何日何時送妥，其發出之公電，免予計費，僅須預付六字之回電報費，卽可接到收報局通幾於傳日何時送妥之回電。此項納費公電，在新訂辦法未實行以前，應由發報人按照去電所含字數按字付費，並須預織回電報費。現在僅須繳納六字之回電報費，亦係優待發報人之一端也。</p>
<p>（六）發報人因事發電，大都亟待收　人回復。　收報和竟擱置不復，未免令人焦急。但發報人如欲再發一電催促　方回電，勢必另納電報費，亦覺太不經濟。現新訂劃一納費公電收費辦法內，規定「發報人請轉知收報和速拍回電」之納費公電一種。　後撥報人如困所發電報亟待回復，而去電後竟未卽得復者，可向電局請求發一納費公電，至收報局轉　收報人催復，收報人接到催復之公電後，當然不能再行遲遲不復。且此項公電，僅須由發報人付一字之報費，較之自行發電催復，省費不少，確爲新訂納費公電收費辦法中之一種優點也。</p>
<p>（七）假定靑島某商號，甫發一電致上海某洋行或外國某廠家定購某種貨物一批，繼聞市塲確息，該項貨物之價格，有陸續猛跌之勢，倘照目前市價去電定購，將來貨到以後，勢必遭受意外虧損。欲圖補救，惟有將業已發出之電報，設法中止。發報人如遇上述情形，不必再發一電逕向收報人聲明，可委託電局代發納費公爾，通知收報局，將該電註銷。電局對於此項公電，祗收一字之報費，可謂低廉巳極，確予發報人以莫大之便利。再發報人對於請求註銷原電之納費公電，如須收報局復電證實者，亦可照辦，祗須預付六字之回電報費，俾收報局將原電註銷後電復發報局。在發報和方而所費，僅此區區六字之回電報費，而發出之電，旣巳由收報局電復蹬明，業經註銷，當可不至發生意外糾紛矣。</p>
<p>（八）設有發往淸苑一電，據電局通知，該電因收報人已往北平，無法投遞。倘發報和確知收報人之北平寓址，而願祖任原電之轉遞報費者，可請電局拍發納費公電，通知清苑電局，將該電轉遞至平。此項公電不論字數若干，僅須付六字之電費，亦頗便宜。</p>
<p>依據上述各節，劃一納費公電收費辦法之頒行，對於收發報人，確有莫大之便利。嗣後收發報人對於所收或所發電報之任何事項，欲向對方電局查詢，或通知對方電局者，均可利用納費公電，不必逕自發電，以免虛糜電費。且此項新訂辦法，對於國內國際電報一律適用。收發報人明瞭利用納費公電方法以後，對於國際電報，省費尤多。由此可見交通部電政司近來對於電報業務上一切設施，均以便利民衆爲前提，服務力求週到也。</p>
<h3>交通部最近對於廣播電臺之整頓</h3>
<p>— 馭周</p>
<p>近年以來，我國各地廣播電臺，時有增設，民衆裝用收音機者，爲數尤衆，鬧市通衢，固莫不歌聲喧雜，卽附近城市之鄕里，亦時見竹桿高豎，比比皆收音機之天綫也。交通部以廣播事業，關係一國之政治文化，至爲重大，矧在我國，民智未開，一般民衆具有讀書閱報之能力者，實居少數，關於社會敎育之推行，普通常識之灌輸，重要消息之傳遞，均有待於廣播電臺之補助，爲謀收正當功效而免意外流弊，對於廣播電賽，極為重視。至從前以我　廣播事樂，尙在萌芽時代，爲提倡起見，不得不稍予放任，現在情形旣有不同，亟應採取嚴格主義，以資整頓。茲將近來整頓情形，擇要縷述，諒亦留心廣播事業者所樂聞也。</p>
<p>（一）停止發給許可證交通部規定用於廣播電臺之週率，係自五百五十千過至一千五百千週，各辜應相差之數，並規定爲十十千週，故事實上計可設立電臺九十餘處。茲交通部以此項週率，業將分配罄盡，而巳成立各電臺，又函待整理，特於上月份規定一律停止發給民營廣播電臺許可體，並登載京滬各大報，諒爲閱者所已知悉。顧吾人尙須注意者，交通部此次停止發給許可證，其目的純在整頓廣播電臺，不可誤認作無故限制民營電信事業也。良以波長旣已分配罄盡，若猶繼續增設，勢必發生干擾現象，卽已成立之廣播電臺，亦將感受播音之困難矣。</p>
<p>（二）取締辦理不善各電臺交通部對於各廣播電臺於准許設立後，仍隨時嚴密稽查，關於機件方面，則指定專員，分赴各臺實地查騐，關於節目方面，則華南曁華北各部，分別由國際電訊局曁天津電報局注意查聽。其辦理不善者，分別懲處，如情節重大，卽予取締。最近實行取締之電臺，已有十餘處，其原因有係於準許設立後，迄未依限成立者，有係機件不良，迭經令飭改善未能遵辦者，有係播送淫詞邪曲復不遵令受罰者，有係私自轉讓頂替者，凡此各項，於交通部公佈之民營廣播無綫電臺暫行取締規則中，固皆明白規定應在禁止之列，各該廣播電臺違背規章，不服指導，遂受取締處分，固屬咎有應得也。</p>
<p>（三）整飭各臺播音節目關於各臺播音節目，交通部在民營廣播電臺暫行取締規則中，已有原則上的規定。惟各電臺每多疏忽，最近交通部通飭各電臺，在消極方面，不得迎合各界低級興趣。播送有傷風化之淫詞邪曲，在積極方面，爲發揚黨義提高人民智識程度激發民族精神起見，每日應劃出相當時間，輪流播送黨義，歷代民族英雄小史，公民常識，國際常識，以及我國固有善良道德等項節目，所有各項報吿，並應以國語爲主。一面飭令各臺將現行之播音節目，檢送一份，嗣後如有變更，並應於五日前呈報，以供稽核上之便利。此外尙有一事足供報吿者，交通部擬俟各臺播音節目收集齊全後，加以縝密之考究，對於一般廣播電臺應有之節目，及其時間之分配，作一具體之規定，俾各臺有所遵守。良以廣播節目之良否，直接關係廣播電臺之實際功效，不得不切實整頓也。</p>
<p>綜上以觀，交通部對於廣播電臺整頓之苦心，已灼然可見。抑吾人尙有不得已於言者，我國廣播事業，組織散漫，且從前以各地法權關係，難於管理，頗現紊亂狀况，社會上嘖有繁言，茲經交通部之努力整頓，已漸趨正軌，苟能依此前進，前途殊有希望。深望黨政各機關對於自設之廣播電臺，依法受交通部主管權之指揮，俾得收通盤籌劃之功效，而各民營廣播電臺，尤當認識責職之重大，與經營普通商業，迪不相同，必須在法令範圍以內，力謀改進也可。</p>
<h3>值得注意之一千萬元</h3>
<p>— 佑</p>
<p>國際無綫電開放後，爲公衆節省之國際報費數目。</p>
<p>自國際電臺，於民國十八年成立後，我國與世界各處往來電報報費價目，屢經接洽减低，計至本年三月底止，公衆因此節省之報費，近一千萬元，茲將詳細數目列表如左：</p>
<p>各界之注意電報情形者，有時或因國際電報銀元價目之增加，而於節省報費一節，發生疑問。查此項增加，係依照國際電信規則隨金法郞兌換率之變更而定，兌換率有所漲落，則銀元價目自不得不隨之增减。但不論此項銀元價目之或增或减，倘標準金法郞價目（見表內第一項）始終未曾減低，（表內第二項卽减低後之價目），則各界對於國際無綫電報費，卽將添增一千萬元之負擔，所謂節省報費者，蓋指此耳。至交通當局所以與各方接洽减低報價之故，良以電信事業服務大衆，不能以營利爲單純目的，故雖在電政經濟極端困難之中，仍將報價儘量减低，以輕公衆之負擔，値得國人稱贊者也。</p>
<h3>近年來世界電信技術上發展的動向</h3>
<p>— 王大椿</p>
<p>近數年來，世界各國的電信事業，在技術上，常有驚人的發展。尤以上年——西歷一九三四年——起，電信技術上有長足的進步，使電信傳輸的能率，益臻繁密而迅捷。所有昔日電信工程師們認爲尙在理想中的一切通信方式，現均次第達於實用的境地。簡言之，現在各國的電信事業，其通信方式，無論在有綫電或無綫電方面，均趨於應用較高的週波率（Higher　Frequencies）今試將各國最新採用的各種通信方式，加以研究時，其最可引人注意的，卽各種通信方式內的通信路（Channels）常包含有寬闊的週率帶（Bands　of　Frequency）。例如上年在歐洲各國採用的多信通信路式電話（Mlulti　channel　Telephone）因其回路內裝有新設計的反饋放大管（Feed-back　Amplifiers）及晶體濾波器（Crystel　Filterer），使此種通信方式，有寬闊的週率帶，足供應用，在通信上，發生極優美的成績。此種技術上的發展，迄今已有多種，雖其結果，各有不同，但能有滿意的成續，可稱一致。</p>
<p>今試將上年度各國電信技術的發展程序中，較爲重要的，先爲申述：其中以載波電話（Carrier　Telephone　System）之用於架空回綫上，較爲著名，以其應用寬闊的週率帶，做成補充通信路，而該項週率帶的閣度，並可用以傳送播音台的廣播節目。此種方式，在上年八月間，捷克的波拉蒂斯拉伐（Bratislava）及高塞斯（Cosice）兩城間，已經實用，卽在原有三通信路上，加一高通信路，該高通信路的週率帶闊度爲七千五百週波。</p>
<p>在原有的電信回路內，增加多量的通信路，爲上年度電信技術發展稈序中，較有意義的一事。其辦法，係將電報機回路內，原有的標準三通信路載波方式上，各加以十和個通信路的音頻電報（Voice　Frequency　Telegraph），如此，連同原有的電話通信路，在一回路的架空綫上，將增加至五十四個雙方收發的電報通信路了。此種裝置法，在南斐洲地角城（Cape　Town）及瓊納斯堡（lohannesburg）兩地，已經實施，其兩端距離，足達一千英里。</p>
<p>電親回路，電話中繼器及負荷綫輪（Loading　Coils）等，凡爲最近的設計，大都可以供給一個電話回路以上的用途，因此新設計的奇巧，在每一普通電話回路上，往往可以另加一載波回路，其週率帶可自三千五百週波起，用至七千週波。新裝的倫敦至格拉斯哥（Glasgow）間電纜，卽照此設計，其通信數量，實騐上可增進不少。由此可知，普通電話回路上，加一單路載波信路，固巳毫無困難，現更進而研究將三路以上的高速度載波通信路，用於極長距離的回路內，其實現期，諒不甚遠。最近澳洲至塔斯瑪尼亞島（Tasmania）間，新設計製造了海底電纜一條，其通信路卽爲多量的，所有週率帶的總闊度，擬定用四萬二千五百週波，兩端的機械設備，亦特別設計，使每一單綫，可以負擔二路（Two-way）電話通信路三個，週率帶達九千週波；一路（One-way）電話通信路三個，週率帶爲一萬一千至二萬週波；其回復通信路三個的週率帶，爲二萬一千至三萬一千週波：此外，再有一路的可換廣播通信路一個，其週波級，係用三萬四千至四萬二千五百週波。</p>
<p>至於陸綫電纜，在一九三三年，美國紐極賽州（New　Jersey）的瑪利斯城（Morristown），曾經做過幾次實騐，有極顯著的重要性：其辦法，將長二十五英里的地下電纜心綫，每兩對在前後兩端，互相環接，如此，將心綫假想的做成了長八五十英里的綫回路，用四至四十基羅週波（KC）的週波率，可得九個載波電話通信路。通信方式的應用同心綫（Coaxial　lines）者（同心綫係一中空的圓形導體管，管中置一較細的導綫，其功效在甚寬的週波級內，可傳輸電報電話或電視符遞），能傳輸更闊的週率帶，現各國正在研究中，所得試騐的結果，可將週率帶之闊度在一千基羅週波以上的，作有效的通暢傳輸，如用適宜的設備，更可將此週波級，分成二百個一路的電話通信路。惟同心綫上，常因週波級的增闊，其通信的衰量，亦將隨之增加，回路內中機器間的距離，在勢必須縮短，因此距離的縮短，中機站上所用中繼器的數量，反可减少，在應用同心綫的回路內，每中繼站得的中繼器，祇需二枚，數量旣經减少，對於技術的管理，可較簡易。（待續）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>五年中娶八十位老婆</h3>
<p>— 似</p>
<p>國民社十一日貝爾格勒電訊，據報載，五年內共娶八十個妻之馬尼亞，已於羅馬尼亞京城被捕，馬氏年僅二十八，據謂彼娶八十妻，曾耗資美金二十萬元，唯結婚後，即騙取女子金錢，旋即棄之，這真是值得注意的一件風流孽障案。</p>
<p>我細細替他考量，五年之中娶了八十位老婆，若平均計算，差不多二十天便要一位新娘，其誘惑異性的手段高明，實足今人驚駭，惟據其所稱，結婚後即騙取女郎金錢，旋即遺棄，彼娶八十位妻，也曾耗資二十萬美金，然則明明是以結婚為手段，以騙取金錢為目的，彼曾結婚八十位女子而耗資達二十萬美金之鉅，則該女子等受其欺騙者，當亦倍蓰於其所耗費，可以斷言，此真可謂天字第一號拆白黨員。</p>
<p>馬尼亞的人品怎樣，雖電文簡略，沒有說明，但觀其吸引女性魔力的偉大，必定是一個年少風流的小白臉無疑，但與其謂馬尼亞之竊玉手段高明，毋寧說是該女子等的智識程度薄弱，凡一女子而和人結婚，豈有對於對手人的人格，品性，學問，身世，完全絕不加以考慮，而一見傾心，貿然以終身大事相托，其愚真是莫及。</p>
<p>重婚有罪，不但我國有些規定，他國法律，諒亦如此，現在馬尼亞氏犯了七八十個重婚罪，不知法官對於該案如何判决，恐在法律上既沒有這樣的條文，在事實上也沒有這樣的先例，在審判該案的法官，倒也是一個難題，我國拆白黨人，號稱出產地，在社會中雖扮演着不少風流慘酷的歷史，但若以與氏案件較之，真還是小巫見大巫。</p>
<p>自從Adam與Eve闖下了彌天大禍以後，人世間便平添多少癡男怨女的風流孽冤，有的女子上煞了男子的當，有的男子上煞了女子的當，難分難解，糾葛不清，這原是一個宇宙之謎，倘有人若能把這謎團打破，社會上必定清凈得多，現在女子，雖說解放，但男女之間，總還隔閡着一重障碍，假定男女之間，果能澈底解放，把宇宙之謎，完全打破，此種孽障自無由發生。</p>
<p>但是現在還有人把男女分校等等主義，提倡起來，在表面上似乎光明一些，其實在實際上反而腐敗一些，因為宇宙之謎，不去打破，又從而神秘起來，簡直使謎者愈謎，而冤者愈冤，語曰私鹽越禁越好賣，徒然多此一舉。</p>
<h3>秋天到來的時候</h3>
<p>— 吉彖</p>
<p>也許大家都知道，每一次季節的循環，每一年，那被稱作「自然現象」的悲劇是在串演着的吧：</p>
<p>當夏天的太陽熏炙得透不過氣來，而在他自己底季節之末尾盡力地掙扎着，企圖來一次「迴光返照」的烈燄的時候，那兒，在天邊，淋來了一陣索落而寒冽的大雨，打在地上，像翻騰着的水老鼠那樣地，起來了，又下去了。</p>
<p>雨繼續地下了幾天，那種清凉的溫氣是多够叫人舒服啊！這之間，三伏裏的太陽開始慢慢地垂倒了頭，像一匹受了創傷的猛虎，也像一個從青年沈落到中年去的人，他底光燄，已經不再有少年時候的勇猛與熱烈，正相反地，却開始變得枯萎而沈着了。於是，讓天空慢慢地高起來，顯得像大海一樣的寂寞與空曠；讓雲慢慢地呈顯出更綺麗而變幻的金色來；讓月亮長成得更清晰而皎潔，讓大氣變得更遲緩而凉爽；這麼着，大自然已經完全佈置好了一個更適合於中年人居住的世界，於是，這褐色的，飽經世故而沈着的秋天，也終於像一位植着行仗的老者一樣的，無聲息地一步步走近來了。</p>
<p>秋天是終於那麼無聲息地潛來了，而山又是那樣的模糊，雲又是那樣的遼遠啊！</p>
<p>是的！在山裏，在樹枝上，在舊宅基的潮濕的磚墻的角落，在枝頭，在都會的商店的旗幟上，在人底心的一角裏，在一切微小的所在，都已經點點地撒下了秋天的影子了。白天吹起悠悠地小風，葉子優閑地落到地上；夜晚，青銅古鏡一樣的月亮掛在中天，一些不知的虫兒在陰濕的屋角裏斷續地聽着；人底心也變成了漠然的大海，一點點地空曠而沈着起來了；像儘在思索一件事物；可是不知道這是什麼；也像在聽着一種聲音，然而說不出是那一種的話語！覺得到的就只是：人底心，人底靈魂，也在跟着花木與果子的凋零而漸漸地老起來，老起來了！從過去的經驗，我知道這是秋天，是為一些沈落的靈魂所建造的秋天了。秋天是無言的，是靜寂與沈着的，他並不要求自然界的紅花綠葉之錦綉的花言巧語，像年青的春日那樣的；他所要求的只是老老實實的果子與收穫——一年來生長着的成績啊。他只是默默地伸出乾枯的手，在沈着的長者的聲音中給了我們一個可怕的要求：「哪！你且拿出你底果實來看，你要證明你曾長成了多少啊！」</p>
<p>這是叫人難以回答的問題：秋天給我們帶來了一個真正的「審判日」，而叫我們在一種無私的懔冽中去疚責着，戰抖着的！</p>
<p>真是難以描畫的，心竟是那樣地寂寞與空虛啊！看見有雁子向南方飛去，真想問一問，什麼地方有高的山——高得難以測想的山——想去登在最高的一個頂點上，對着世界，對着這整個的人間，做一次最粗野的原始的呼號啊！</p>
<p>是的，真想有一次瘋狂的呼號啊：我看見了陰沈的太陽，我看見了凋殘的樹木，我看見了年青人鬢髩上的灰白的點子，而最後，在這一堆殘酷的自然現象中間，我看見了秋天！</p>
<p>驚詫着，為什麼會有那種奇怪而難受的心情呢？也許在怕着，在担心着一些好天氣的不可挽回的凋落吧？然而這是不確切的；天與雲依然是那麼沈靜而明朗，「審判日」的天氣不一定是多風雨的，可是想一想那可怕的凋殘呢……</p>
<p>大自然是無私的，好的日子終究已經過去，而現在是秋天到來的時候了！</p>
<h3>孫富朝</h3>
<p>— 史維之</p>
<p>人物塑像之一</p>
<p>孫富朝，算起輩份來我應該稱呼他一聲舅公，但是因為他從小就在我家裏做活，年齡又衹差我十幾歲，所以稱呼他舅公，至反而在近乎開玩笑的時候，他聽了，不是臉紅紅的說：「別這麼叫，聽起來怪刺耳的」便是裝出一副長輩的架子，把聲音裝得滿正經的：「孩子，乖乖的不要鬧，舅公等會兒買糖給你吃」！</p>
<p>沒等到說完，他先就禁不住笑出聲來。</p>
<p>不論他臉紅紅的禁止我們叫他舅公，或是裝着長輩的身份來喊，我們是孩子，我們在既得高興的時候總歡喜叫他舅公，並且，因為他怕我們叫他的緣故，我們總一連聲的舅公的叫，一直使他答應了我們的才罷，而在他回答我們的時候，我們纔一齊聲的哈哈的笑了，笑得他怪不好意思的。</p>
<p>他愛渴酒，甚至飯可以不吃，酒可是每餐非有不興的，但是他怕父親，每</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>次喝酒總是背着父親偷偷地喝的，一聽到父親從樓上下來的足聲，他總是把酒藏了，把下酒的五香豆，花生之類團在一包的藏在衣袋裏，等父親到外面去的時侯再拿出來喝，因爲這樣，他有時候忽忽的吃一淺碗飯，有時甚至連飯都不吃，聽到父親的足聲，便把飯往飯桶裏一倒，捧起空碗來把飯屑吃個乾凈，讓父親看起來總是剛吃好飯似的，於是把飯碗一放，便回到他工作的竹椅子上去</p>
<p>但是他雖然愛喝酒，他勸別人可是以不喝酒爲妙的，他對待我們，五香豆，花生，牛肉之類會毫不吝嗇的儘讓我們抓着吃，他手裏的五茄皮或是虎骨木瓜酒，可是從來不肯讓我們喝的，這自然是他愛酒如命的緣故，但他深深的知道酒的害處。</p>
<p>從什麼時候起他嗜好起酒來，這我們是不知道的，但是他會什麼要喝酒，這原因却是我們所知道的。</p>
<p>喝飽了酒，他一面工作，一面便唱起小孤孀上墳或是什麼來，唱呀唱的，唱到後來總是唱鳳陽花鼓，「別人家老婆做綢又做布，我的老婆一雙大脚婆」，反復着，顚倒着老是唱這麼二句。</p>
<p>他的身體很結實，皮膚是帶些棕色的，胸前刺着一個黃天霸。他能移用二隻手亳不費事的爬到人家的凉棚頂上去。</p>
<p>在我們的眼光裏，他是樂天的，他不像父親整天的沒有笑容，他一天到晚總是有說有笑的，等到笑得倦了或是說得倦了他便喝起酒來，好像喝酒能够忘記什麼心事似的。</p>
<p>家裏時常有信來，他總是偷偷地吊我讀給他聽，信呢，老是向他要錢，他聽了老是一聲不響的把信撕得粉碎，然後又喝酒，又唱小孤孀上墳和鳳陽花鼓，唱的時侯，或是喝酒的時候，有時突然像記起了什麼似的，輕輕的向我說：「別向你父親說鄉下又有信來」。</p>
<p>漸漸地，我知道他有一個並不愛的家，和一個並不愛的妻子。</p>
<p>記得父親要爲我了他的終身大事的心愿的時候，他曾經鼓起勇氣向父親抗議過：「這是一生一世的事情，你要小心一點纔好」。背後，又偷偷地問我：」你歡喜不歡喜這頭親事？不要怕難爲情，老婆討不着「世苦呀」！</p>
<p>以後，我離開了家？帶了我的並不愛的妻子，到各處去找食去，關於他的消息也好久沒聽到了。</p>
<p>最近，聽到了關於他的消息，說是：富朝瘋了，身體是發酒瘋，變成痴痴癲癲的，哭笑無常，一有錢還是去喝酒，沒有錢，見到東西魷要偷。</p>
<h3>閑暇與雲</h3>
<p>— 程銓</p>
<p>天，漸慚地在凉起來，秋天彷彿又在眼前了。黃昏，帶着一身微微的汗，與多量的疲勞回來：天！也許這便是一點生活的懲罰吧？然而，難道眞的生活是一種過失，一種罪惡嗎？爲什麼呢？聖神沒這樣說過，天神也沒這樣說過：這樣說的，是社會啊！是的，還有是…</p>
<p>好，儘它把生活當作是一種過失，讓它去用種種方法來對無數的犯者來刑罰着，毒虐着吧；繼續要說的是，在一天的刑罪中，到晚來，帶了一個受傷的疲乏的身體，說，也居然有了一點休息，一點眞正的休息與閑暇啊！</p>
<p>在烏黑的房屋裏坐了下來，點起一支烈味的捲烟，讓它着了火，烟一絲絲地騰上去，一絲絲地，騰上去又消滅了，於是，我看到窗外的雲！那永遠是浮游在靑空中的，像烟一樣的雲！</p>
<p>（像烟一樣的雲哪！一堆一堆的，在像着了的色的畫布一樣的大空浮游着：赤金的，嫣紅的，紫羅蘭的！全是那麼地豐滿，那麼地饱吸了生命之精華的啊！一層層地堆疊着，遼遠像嚝野的關山；一個人—個流浪的人—是容易想念到他底家鄉，而分明地從雲的色彩上指出那一朶是曾經從自己故鄕的天空飄着過來的。於是，帶給它一千聲的珍重啊！然而它是淡泊的，流浪的，而終於在不斷的飄流中，它自身也儘是不斷地變幻着過去了，是的，雲是變幻的！）</p>
<p>變幻的啊！像受了針刺一樣地，猛地跳起來！已經不敢相信自己的理智了；然而，那有什麼用呢，眞理的鏡子會照出自己底多縐紋的臉，與蒼白了的鬢髮的；少年的生命在一天一天的老起來，世界已經走得那麼遠（也許在前進，也許在後退，可是，誰知道呢？），總之，生命飄游着，也像雲一樣已經變，幻了阿！</p>
<p>正像雲一樣地，從生活的灰空中飄着過來，靑春是怎樣去的？笑是怎樣在心裏絕了蹤跡的？這一切，已經完全糢糊得像宿年的夢了。而且，去追想它們是需要更大的冒險的勇氣的—不是近來，在遠處，在一所糢糊的遠處，一種沉重的足音又一步步地在踏向前來了嗎？沉滯的，灰暗的，打在人底心上，像喪禮行進中的鼓，它帶了人向一個不可知的地方走去，我想到了！那是中年！那是衰老！那是死亡啊！</p>
<p>全是義幻啊！生命，誰又能否定，它是像雲一樣的不斷地在飄流中變幻着的呢？</p>
<p>變幻着，直到黑夜的來臨，用他底黑色的喪服來掩沒了大地，掩沒了整個世界爲止！</p>
<p>有一個時候我讀過郞番羅底「生命之歌」，那生命的沉重的脚步是被感到了：「從泥士裏來的啊！你將回到泥土裏去！」而現在，生命像雲一樣地在幻變，在飄流，掛在一個年靑的孩子底面前的，在一秒鐘以後，已經不再是油綠的豐盛的葉子，而是一幅褐灰色的中年的幕子了！</p>
<p>接着來的將是一種什麼心情呢？彷彿小木船上的老船夫巳得了大海中的風浪的預示似的，好奇地等待着，準備着，却又不斷地顫抖着。</p>
<p>看着雲，我像沉落在冰窟裏那樣的，凜冽而失望了，我好像看見了生命之枯萎的容顏，也聽到了它底逐漸在微弱的脈搏！生命所給予人的，僅是與天空的雲一樣的，一團不可捉摸的虛空得像夢一樣的變幻阿！</p>
<p>（捲烟是，已經燃到了烟蒂的盡頭了，而餘下來的是，一些毀滅的灰燼啊！）</p>
<p>閑暇的時候是看雲的，而於今是，終於閑睱給帶來了難以述說的　怖了，是愚蠢的啊！</p>
<p>（黑夜來了！）</p>
<p>我怕，我甚至不敢入睡，我知道：今夜的夢定又會是可怕的一個。</p>
<p>我决定，以後不再看雲了。</p>
<h3>奔馬的感情</h3>
<p>— 真</p>
<p>又是「世紀末！世紀末！」</p>
<p>當我連今天的裹腹糧都要向綺麗都市的暗黑底角落裏去探尋的時候，便這樣沉重地發出一聲粗巨的慨嘆，同時心弦打足了滿弓，便像四重奏那樣繁複，迫促，繚亂，連神經系也有些漲痛！</p>
<p>感情裏雜着多量的火的原素，它操縱了我的喜怒哀樂，一剎那頃在笑一剎那頃又在哭，有時又哭笑不得的只是莫明其妙地直着眼在想，似乎有責任的要想一件事把哭笑不得的難題移轉去，然而想什麼呢？——一轉眼仍是那些哭笑不得的難題襲攏來。</p>
<p>仰頭看天，天是木然地和我腦神經一樣，幾片游雲，至低也只和我尙有一絲喘息罷了！我滿屋子跑，屋子自然是小了，我想縱使再大一點，也容不下我那龐大無朋的憤懣，因爲茫茫無邊的天空，在我眼前也是渺小得可憐，它實在渺小，連我容膝的地方也成了奢望。</p>
<p>馬路上便成了我感情的遊戲塲，那調子是激越的，它和狂風競賽，越過喜馬拉耶和阿耳卑斯山高原，越過地球上僅有的海洋系，也徘徊過天上羅列的星球系，靈魂無知而又似有意地離開了這具只算未僵的肉體，我在想着，天地只算是一樣卑狹的窮廬，絲毫找不着「我」的什麼，我想到天外去，有一種分外的想在天外發現極樂世界的希求。然當我靈魂與肉體重行結合時，始發覺我那伴白得像我吐出來的痰沫底顏色的上衣上，禮帽上，佈滿着不知何時從上層洋樓中扔下的香蕉皮和瓜子皮，我討厭牠們，我驅逐牠們，——一粒一片地。</p>
<p>我終究沒到天外，——很淸徹地我尙在人間，眼前的一切不會欺騙我。把饑荒的瞳子向着鱗櫛的小擺攤上掃去，不暇接的特有的香氛刺和我的嗅覺，我淌着口水來接受，但一回顧週遭，淌口水者尙大有人在，我不寂寞了，在茫茫的宇宙中，我生命尚不是孤獨的脆弱，絕望的淒涼。</p>
<p>我完全挾着留戀似的心情回到和間來了，從汗汁浸漬的背上，忽然感覺着一陣淸幽的凉意，我回頭時，是一位同我一樣閃着飢眼的被「盛世」遺棄了的老公公，——我這樣稱呼他是本能的，一點也不算是過分的恭維，而他有那柄蒲扇，也比我多一件生產工具，他實在比我富有，但他只是扇着我那只裝一枚銅子的上衣，眞是一椿出奇的寃枉！然而他仍是無感覺地而又熱烈地扇着，步子隨着我的快慢，扇子一張一弛地也吻合着我肺葉的伸縮，「君子成人之美」，於是一枚銅子，也輕輕地和我宣吿仳離了</p>
<p>而他又走到兩位摩登女郞的背後去了，扇着，扇着，可是那風絲只飄動了她們旗袍的下端，不曾襲進她們「慈善」的心園，同時分明那扇風也沒有永洪淋，冷氣趕走火素的魔力；而她們似乎此我還更慳吝，連一枚銅子也不曾留給老公公。但他絲亳不氣累，不惱怒，又轉</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>臉到長衫紳士那里去了，他追出着，掙扎着，仗着那件唯一的工具，似乎要活個痛快而澈底。</p>
<p>然而我有什麼呢？——我想；是，我仍不是一無所有，我有着無痛無憂的手足，我有一顆法律管不着的心兒，想到這里，我的情戚又如奔馬的飛越了，但不是渺茫的天外，而是現實的和間。</p>
<p>『從惡魔的手裏，救了靈的世界的人。「不論誰祇要繼續的努力，我們都可以使他超昇」。上天也有愛的同情，一切的神們，衷心地對他表示歡迎」。</p>
<p>歌德在「浮士往」中幻化了天使這樣歌着，我也這樣歌着，而且盲目似地篤信着。</p>
<p>播音節目</p>
<h3>新歌介紹</h3>
<p>滿目淒涼</p>
<p>（一）社會是這樣淫蕩，人心是這樣頹喪，抬頭一望滿目凄凉！屋子里裝滿顏色，屋子里裝滿肉香，不知多少靑年被埋葬！</p>
<p>（二）有了手，不去應用，就和沒有手一樣；魔宮呀！我的丈夫，活活被你埋葬！有了腿，不堂向上，就和沒有腿一樣，魔宮呀！我的丈夫，活活被你埋葬！年紅燈光，燦爛輝煌，麻醉了　的心房；酒的濃查，肉的芬芳，迷住了他的志向；失去孑，一切的希望；帶回了，一重重，怨恨懊喪；抬起頭，滿目凄凉，低了頭，遍地滄矣！</p>
<p>（三）有了腦，有去思想，就和沒有腦子一樣；沒有腦，殘廢一樣，一切都成了絕望！有了力，不去工作，就和殘廢瘋癱一樣；只享樂！不能久長，一生只有悲傷！情歌齊響，艷曲悠揚，蒙住了他的思想；眉的飛舞，色的奔放，埋葬了他的剛强；靑年啊！國家多難；已不是笙歌燕舞的時光！靑年啊！睜開眼來看一看！滿目凄凉！</p>

<h3>蝴蝶呌賣「夜來香」</h3>
<p>夜來香現在僅剩了舞塲一景，全部告竣，可指日而待了。</p>
<p>昨天明星攝影塲中，拍舞塲的最後一塲，胡蝶站在舞塲的門口呌賣「夜來香」。</p>
<p>這一天，大少爺孫敏，本來約好了一位女友來跳舞，誰知她竟失會跟了別的男人來，而且又特別的親熱，這眞够孫敏氣憤，他恨地跑出舞塲，恰巧這時胡蝶在正門口呌賣「夜來香」，他一發現胡蝶的模樣，非單不覺得討厭，而且對她特別地表示好感，給她一大捲鈔票，僅買了她一朶「夜來香」。</p>
<p>這一幕戲拍完了，胡蝶笑着說道：「一朶花能賣這許多錢，要是眞的賣夜來香就好了」</p>
<h3>談王瑩施超的演技</h3>
<p>「自由神」快公映了，在王瑩，可說是她在銀幕上最成功的一個作品，也是有聲片運動中的開口等一聲。據她說，「自由神」太使她感動了，全部的劇情，像是她身世的寫眞，在攝影塲中，她忘掉這是在做戲，銀幕上的悲歡，離合，喜怒，歌，哭，這是她內心的熱情流露。她想，人生不會再有這般的眞切了。這一點，是促成她的演技更深一層的收穫。至於施超，他是一九三五年電通擢取新人之一。在聲片運動年中，電通對他抱着極大的希望。這次「自由神」里，他飾一個然情的革命的青年，他的靈敏的動作，純眞的感情，百折不畏的精神，逼眞地表演了劇中人的個性。</p>
<h3>鄭正秋先生追悼會廿五日在湖社舉行</h3>
<p>鄭正秋先生之追悼大會，已由各團體籌備多時，昨日潮州旅滬同鄕會，將召集各團體開會討論，决定於本月二十五日在北京路湖社舉行云。</p>
<h3>「兩小無猜」公映</h3>
<p>「兩小無猜」是爲童星佛雷湯麥斯和海倫柏麗許初次合演，殊有異常驚人的成績，視「塊肉餘生」之佛雷巴塞羅密（飾大衛幼年時代者）未爲多讓，而故事亦頗耐人回味，同時特映之卡通名作「杖頭小鳥」和滑稽短片「未來法律」，都屬上乘俊品，現在南京公映。左爲兩小無猜一圖面。</p>

<h3>After the Central Executive Committee Resolution, A Telegram Was Sent to President Wang to Reassure Him and Urge Him to Stay. 'The Central Authority Bears a Heavy Responsibility and Depends on Your Leadership; Please Dismiss Your Thoughts of Resignation and Return to the Capital Quickly.' Wei Huai, Upon Receiving Orders, Visited Wang and Has Left Qingdao to Return to the Capital.</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding Wang's resignation from his positions as President of the Executive Yuan and concurrently as Minister of Foreign Affairs, after Secretary-General Ye reported to the Central Executive Committee on the 15th about his trip to Qingdao to reassure Wang, a resolution was immediately passed to urge him to stay.

All are of the opinion that the state of the nation is precarious, facing internal and external pressures. Your efforts to manage the situation have been extremely arduous. Now that the underlying illness has been addressed, a brief respite will surely lead to a full recovery. The central authority bears a heavy responsibility and depends on your leadership. We earnestly hope that you will dismiss your thoughts of resignation so that you may recuperate in peace. We especially hope that you will return to the capital quickly to strengthen the central government. We eagerly anticipate your arrival." (15th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>The Shuangcheng River in Yutian County: Three New Embankments Have Breached; The Flooded Area of the Huanxiang River Breach Is Extremely Large</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Three new embankments of the Shuangcheng River at Daijiazhuang, Yutian, have breached, each breach being fourteen or fifteen zhang wide. The water flow is rapid, making it impossible to block. The Li Guantuan dam is also in critical condition. Villagers tried to reinforce it but were swept into the river by huge waves, resulting in several deaths by drowning. The Huanxiang River has also breached, and the flooded area is extremely large. Over ten thousand victims are taking refuge in treetops and on rooftops, eating tree bark to stave off hunger. The county magistrate has telegraphed the province for aid. In the Dongguang County section of the Southern Grand Canal, five points of water seepage were discovered in the dikes, causing severe erosion and creating an extremely dangerous situation.

<p>The Three-Nation Conference of England, France, and Italy. Preparatory talks are currently underway, and the official opening is imminent. The convening of this conference was decided before the recent meeting of the League of Nations Executive Council. Since the Executive Council could not fully resolve the Italian-Abyssinian issue, it had to seek another solution outside of the League of Nations. This conference is largely based on the 1906 agreement between England, France, and Italy regarding Abyssinia and the 1925 exchange of notes between England and Italy. The former agreement superficially recognized and respected the territorial integrity of Abyssinia but was actually a contract for the three countries to prepare to divide Abyssinia's sphere of influence. The most notable point was that the agreement allowed Italy to build railways within Abyssinia. As for the 1925 exchange of notes between England and Italy, England further allowed Italy to exclusively enjoy various economic benefits along the railways. Therefore, after this meeting convenes, England will be able to meet Italy with greater sincerity and will not just pay lip service. According to recent European dispatches, England is prepared to allow Italy to acquire extensive economic benefits in Abyssinia in accordance with the conditions outlined in the 1925 exchange of notes between the two countries, but it will not recognize its political preferential rights. Although this proposal by England may not be fully accepted by Italy, it is very clear that England has returned to the position of 1925 on the Italian-Abyssinian issue. From this perspective, if this conference can succeed, the Italian-Abyssinian War may be avoided, but the independence and sovereignty of Abyssinia will inevitably suffer some harm.</p>
<p>The possibility of success for this conference is still unknown. However, its impact on the European situation is not insignificant. Because England's current actions demonstrate great determination, if France and Italy cannot coordinate with England, then England will withdraw from the European collective peace system and will ignore threats to France from Germany or invasions of Austria by Germany (see Paris dispatch, 14th). This step by England will cause great anxiety for France and Italy. Considering this, the two countries can increase the possibility of success for this conference. Regarding France, it strongly opposed England's proposal to Italy in 1925, believing that it went against the principles of maintaining Abyssinia's territorial integrity and open door policy in the 1906 Three-Nation Agreement (see Briand's reply to England and Italy, July 14, 1926). Recently, France has been catering to Italy's will in every way, wanting Italy to support its position against Germany. However, the establishment of a European collective peace system relies heavily on England's support. If England announces its withdrawal, France's position against Germany will be greatly threatened. Even with Italy's cooperation, it will not help. Therefore, France slightly changing its policy of assisting Italy in every way and working hard to mediate so that a Three-Nation Agreement can be established is something that France would naturally want to do. Regarding Italy, Mussolini has consistently declared his ambition to swallow the entire territory of Abyssinia. However, if the breakdown of the Three-Nation Conference results in England's withdrawal from the European collective peace system, the situation in Central Europe will change drastically. At this time, even if Italy wants to manage Abyssinia, it cannot help but be concerned. Mussolini once hinted at a strategy of joining hands with Germany, but there were two preconditions: (1) Germany recognizes Austria's independence. (2) Italy has the determination to abandon its friendship with France. Judging from the current situation, Italy joining hands with Germany would not be of much benefit. Moreover, judging from the 1925 exchange of notes between England and Italy, Italy's hope for Abyssinia was originally the same as England's proposal. If it gives up military action against Abyssinia and submits to England's proposal, it cannot be said to have lost face. Therefore, it is also possible that Italy will generally accept this British proposal.</p>
<h3>US Treasury Secretary Reaffirms Silver Purchases Will Rise and Fall with Market Prices, Stabilizing Silver Prices and Preventing Silver Faction Activities, Over 20 Million Ounces Purchased on Wednesday</h3>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau announced today that the Treasury Department purchased 25 million ounces of silver on Wednesday. The amount of silver purchased on this one day was even greater than the national production last year. The Treasury Secretary also said that the Treasury Department's silver purchase plan will gradually increase as silver prices fall. The Treasury Secretary also said that the purchases were made in New York and London, and that purchases will continue in the future. Morgenthau also denied rumors that he had been negligent in purchasing silver in recent days. As for what impact the government's silver purchase plan will have on the market, Morgenthau said he did not know. As for the amount of silver coins in circulation, Morgenthau thought the number had decreased slightly. (National Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's comments today, made after various rumors and protests from silver faction senators, are seen by many as a move to prevent the Senate from investigating silver purchase procedures and to stop the world's silver bulls from continuing to close out their positions. Morgenthau also said that when market prices are low, the Treasury Department increases silver purchases, which is a good deal. This policy makes the Treasury Department less active when prices are stable, but very active when speculators close out their positions. Recently, India and China have sold large quantities, causing world silver prices to plummet, he said. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<h3>London Silver Market More Stable, Result of US Treasury Secretary's Remarks</h3>
<p>(London) The silver market was more stable this morning, which was due to US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's statement in Washington yesterday that the United States will continue to purchase silver in order to eliminate the bulls. According to estimates, the United States has purchased approximately 50 million to 60 million ounces of silver in the past three days. The Financial Times reported that since the passage of the Silver Act, the United States has purchased a total of 38,505,000 ounces of newly mined silver, 112,912,000 ounces of nationally owned silver, and 270,000,000 ounces purchased on the open market. At the same time, the United States' gold reserves have greatly increased, so the silver holdings are not relatively large. Therefore, the ratio of one-third gold to three-thirds silver stipulated in the Silver Act is still far away. Experts estimate that if the United States no longer purchases gold from now on, it will still need to purchase 800 million ounces of silver to meet this ratio. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) All newspapers published silver news on the front page because of the huge volume of transactions. It is estimated that the United States purchased 25 million ounces from the bulls today. India and China, who were previously engaged in multiple positions, sold first in order to close out their positions because there was no new development in the US silver purchase policy. Yesterday, the United States purchased huge quantities at a slightly lower price than before. Today, seeing yesterday's price drop, the bulls rushed to sell, and the market price initially fell by one and three-quarters pence lower than yesterday, and then another quarter. The United States purchased a lot of silver and had to purchase a lot of foreign exchange, so the exchange rate of the US dollar in terms of pounds sterling was weak. The selling wind was strong yesterday and today, and the bulls' chips were greatly reduced, so the silver market showed a more stable atmosphere. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>(New York) Wall Street believes that the continued decline in silver prices is a reflection of speculators' disappointment. Speculators feel that the Treasury Department is not maintaining silver prices and that Congress is in recess, so they expect that there will be no favorable actions for the silver faction for the time being, and they are closing out their positions one after another. There is a saying in the New York market that the Treasury Department continues to purchase, but according to silver merchants, the Treasury Department is particularly serious about delivery and timing, so the general public believes that this move by the Treasury Department makes it difficult for speculators to sell. At the same time, the parliament is silent on the low silver price. Only Senator Pittman commented on this matter, saying that he was not alarmed at all because he was sure that the Treasury Department's actions would be sure to be effective. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<h3>US Senate Silver Faction Plans to Propose Investigating Government Actions, Anxious About Low Silver Prices, President Approves Social Security Act</h3>
<p>(Washington) Senate Silver Faction Leader Thomas announced today that he plans to ask the Senate Agriculture Committee to investigate the government's silver purchase policy. Thomas said that silver prices have fallen again today, so he believes that there should be action. However, neutral observers and experts here believe that there are three main reasons for the decline in silver prices: (1) Speculators believe that the Treasury Department does not want to actively purchase silver for the time being; (2) The near end of the congressional recess will gradually eliminate the pressure to urge the government to speed up silver purchases; (3) Recently, the ratio of the US dollar to the pound sterling has plummeted. At the same time, Senator McCarran has proposed an amendment to the estate tax bill to abolish the silver profit tax. If McCarran asks for a vote, the vote will be held in the middle of this week. However, McCarran said that he does not plan to ask for a vote unless he is sure of passing it. (National Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Democratic Senator Thomas, the leader of the Senate Silver Faction, said today that he is drafting a proposal to ask Congress to investigate the government's silver purchase procedures. The investigation is not aimed at individuals, but is related to the government's overall procedures. If the silver purchase procedures must be implemented, they should be implemented immediately, because the current government does not have a guarantee of being in power forever. If such procedures do not need to be implemented, they should also be stopped immediately and should not be delayed for a long time. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt approved the Social Security Act today and said that this act is the cornerstone of a new building that has not yet been completed. The amazing changes in culture and industry in the past century have made life more and more insecure. Today, this act has realized a large part of many years of hope, will pay attention to human needs, and will establish a more stable economic structure in the United States. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate discussed President Roosevelt's estate tax bill today. Republican Senator Vandenberg moved to leave this bill for consideration at the next congressional session. As a result of the vote, Vandenberg's motion was rejected by 55 votes to 19. This was the first failure of the Republican Party to attack the current government. (National Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Agricultural Adjustment Administration today reduced the wheat acreage reduction required in the 1936 wheat adjustment contract from 15% to 10%. This change will increase the US wheat acreage by 5.2 million acres in 1936. The Secretary of Agriculture told reporters that the August wheat production report showed that US wheat production was greatly reduced due to damage from black rust and hot weather. Therefore, after the release of this report, it was decided to reduce the reduction. He hoped that this move would enable the United States to stand in a strong position in the world export market. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator Bankhead predicted today that the authorities will announce a cotton loan of 12 cents per pound around the end of this week. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<h3>US and Far East Economy, Asked Whether Roosevelt Will Send an Investigation Team</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, someone asked President Roosevelt whether the United States intended to send an economic investigation team to China. President Roosevelt turned this question over to the State Department. The reason for this question is that the United States' attitude towards the United Kingdom sending Sir Otto Niemeyer to China to investigate the economy was too cold. The US side also said that the US economic investigation team that recently returned to the US from the Far East and the private organizations that fully represent commercial groups have no relationship with the government. (National News Agency, 14th)</p>
<h3>Philippines Asks US to Maintain Market, Allow Philippine Goods to be Freely Imported into US</h3>
<p>(Washington) Philippine Vice Governor Hayden wrote to Senator Tydings, Chairman of the Senate Territorial Affairs Committee, saying that after a detailed study of all the facts, it is known that if Philippine products cannot continue to be freely imported into the US market in large quantities, the Philippine independent government will not have sufficient revenue to maintain the expenses of the central or local governments. The standard of living in the Philippines is much higher than in other places in the Far East, so it is difficult for its products to compete with other countries in any market except the United States. If economic difficulties occur, political unrest will naturally follow. Therefore, if the United States implements the full import tax rate on the Philippines, the experiment of the autonomous government will fail. Hayden believes that the most appropriate reciprocal trade agreement between the United States and the Philippines is to allow goods that do not compete with American agricultural and industrial products to be freely imported, while US goods are also used as trade on the same terms. At present, the United States is seeking trade all over the world, so why not maintain and promote the Philippine market? (National Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Committee Members and Staff Decided for the Japan-Manchukuo Economic Committee</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The government issued an order today appointing Lieutenant General Nishio Toshizo, Embassy Counselor Tani Masayuki, Director-General of the Eastern Bureau Ono Rokuro, and Takeushi Kakichi, Fourth Rank, Third Class Order of Merit, as Japanese members of the Japan-Manchukuo Joint Economic Committee. It also appointed Embassy First Secretary Yamamoto Kumaichi, Army Infantry Colonel Nagatsu Sabiju, Army Infantry Lieutenant Colonel Akiyaga Getsuzo, and Director of the Kwantung Army Government Policy Department Takebe Rokuzo as Japanese staff members of the Japan-Manchukuo Joint Economic Committee. ((Japan Federation News, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Since Matsuoka Yosuke took office as the president of South Manchuria Railway (Mantetsu), he has been discussing various policies with the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Army, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Colonial Affairs. Because the work has been completed, he is scheduled to leave Tokyo on the 23rd at 9:00 AM to take office. (Japan Federation News, 15th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) Manchurian trade has become a deformed development in recent years, that is, since the September 18th Incident, it has changed from a surplus in previous years to a deficit. Imported goods are almost exclusively occupied by Japanese goods. In the first half of this year, Japanese goods accounted for more than 70% of import trade. Therefore, Manchuria has become an exclusive market for Japanese goods. Thousands of acres of forest land in the three states of Spokan, Mountana, Idaho and Oregon are on fire. A thousand firefighters are working hard to rescue. Wild animals in the forest, such as bears, deer, and rabbits, are being burned by the flames and are scurrying around. It is feared that many wild animals will die. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>An investigation of the trade in the first half of this year shows that exports were 225,529,200 yuan and imports were 298,824,300 yuan. Compared to last year, not only were exports much worse, but imports also increased sharply by 30,129,000 yuan. The deficit jumped to 72,951,000 yuan. Furthermore, Japanese goods accounted for 214,255,000 yuan of the total import amount, exceeding 70% of the total amount. Now, let's look at the overall trend of Manchurian trade since 1931 before the September 18th Incident, listing the amounts (unit: thousand yuan):</p>
<p>1931 Surplus 39,762</p>
<p>1932 Surplus 280,484</p>
<p>1933 Deficit 67,354</p>
<p>1934 Deficit 145,135</p>
<p>1935 (Half Year) Deficit 72,950</p>
<p>That is, since 1933, the trade in "Manchuria" has suddenly changed from a traditional surplus to a deficit, and exports have gradually decreased and imports have gradually increased. In the first half of this year, it reached an unprecedented deficit. The most noteworthy thing is that the relationship between the import and export of Japanese goods has suddenly increased, and the impact of the deficit on the finances of "Manchuria" is also great.</p>
<p>The main reasons for the decline in exports are two: (1) the world agricultural panic; (2) the decline in exports to China and the severance of trade. Since the September 18th Incident, "Manchuria"'s exports have decreased by about 60%. The increase in imports is due to the influx of Japanese goods and the increase in materials such as railway construction materials exported from Japan. However, for some commodities, they have caused an increase in exports and a decrease in imports. Those that caused an increase in exports include steel, sulfur, wood, coal, wool, salt, beef, and flax. Those that caused a decrease in imports include wheat flour, cement, ironware, kerosene, beer, wood, and other cotton, sacks, and cigarettes. In short, Manchurian trade has become a deformed development in recent years and is subject to the domination of Japanese economic power. (China United Press, 15th)</p>

<h3>British Official Denies Talk of Naval Conference, But Japanese Dispatch Says It Will Be Held in October</h3>
<p>(London) According to sources in Tokyo, the British government proposed that the five major naval powers of England, the United States, Japan, France, and Italy hold a naval conference in October of this year. Officials here recently firmly denied this statement, saying that regarding the naval conference, preparatory talks will be held first between England, France, and Italy to determine the basis for discussing naval issues. It is also unknown whether the Soviet Union will be invited to participate in the talks. Before these preparatory talks are completed, the naval conference will not be convened. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The British government is actively preparing to hold a naval disarmament conference this autumn. As a result of the recent meeting between Gray, Counselor of the British Foreign Office, and Fujii, the Japanese Charge d'Affaires in England, it was decided to convene a formal disarmament conference in London in October of this year. The British government recently unofficially notified Charge d'Affaires Fujii and asked him to convey it to the Foreign Ministry of his country. The British government has reached an agreement with Germany on naval issues and plans to conduct negotiations with France and Italy in early September. After completing the preparatory work, it will begin negotiations with the United States and convene a formal conference in October, regardless of whether the preparatory negotiations are successful, to resolve all issues. The Japanese Foreign Ministry received the unofficial invitation from the British government on the 14th and immediately conveyed it to the Navy Ministry. The Foreign and Navy Ministries seem to be willing to accept the British invitation to attend the conference and are preparing in a tense atmosphere. (Japan Federation News, 15th)</p>
<h3>British Commerce Continues to Improve</h3>

<h3>Monster of Mount Rosa, Switzerland</h3>
<p>More than Nine Feet Long and as Thick as a Giant Tree, Yellow-Green in Color. Dozens of people in Mount Rosa, Switzerland, have claimed that they have seen a monster in recent days. It looks like a dragon. This creature has lived in the nearby dense forest for four years and has been glimpsed from time to time. It has only recently hidden. According to an eyewitness, the creature is actually a giant python, yellow-green in color, more than nine feet long, and as thick as a giant tree. The farmers in the nearby village are extremely frightened. The authorities are now organizing a large team to capture this monster so that the villagers will not tremble when they go out at night.

<h3>Continuing Reports on the Italian Floods</h3>
<p>The scene in the vicinity of Milan and Ovada today is bleak. Yesterday's heavy rain has turned the plains into lakes. Many people and animals have drowned, and the loss of property is immeasurable. The villages of Marassi and Capriata are almost completely destroyed. In Ovada, over 130 houses have been washed away. Rescue efforts are continuing around the clock, but are hampered by muddy terrain and continuing rainfall. It is therefore difficult to ascertain the number of casualties in the coming days. Excessive rainfall from Monday night to Tuesday morning caused the water level in Lake Bassignana to rise sharply, from 5 million cubic meters to 15 million cubic meters. Finally, a 200-meter embankment collapsed with a loud crash. Because the lake level was higher than the surrounding plains, the floodwaters were extremely powerful, sweeping away everything in their path. The disaster area is 40 kilometers long and 2 kilometers wide. (14th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>According to a report from the committee sent to the Morèl area near Milan to investigate the cause of the lake gate collapse, the collapse was due to continuous heavy rain that raised the lake's water level 15 feet higher than normal, putting excessive pressure on the stone foundation. However, the lake's main water gate, built solidly, was not damaged. Only the nearby reservoir, used for power generation, could not withstand the pressure and collapsed first. Then, the torrent rushed into the lake below, and the lake gate was finally washed away, emptying the reservoir completely. As a result, the lake's water volume, which usually holds 18 million cubic meters, is now only 2 million cubic meters. Although the rain has not stopped, there is no longer a risk of the lake gate collapsing again. This lake and its power generation equipment were built ten years ago, and this is the first time the water gate has collapsed. The investigation committee has been ordered to study methods for repairs. (15th National Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Discusses Nagata Incident: A Truly Regrettable Matter for Military Reputation; Serious Impact on Tiger's Aftermath; Current Important Task within the Control Department</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After the cabinet meeting on the 15th, Army Minister Hayashi met with the press corps and initially expressed his feelings regarding the assassination of Military Affairs Bureau Chief Nagata. Here is a transcript of his remarks: "Lieutenant General Nagata's sudden death on the 12th of this month is truly regrettable for the reputation of the national army. I am deeply responsible, feeling that my lack of virtue has led to this. Regarding this incident, appropriate follow-up measures must be taken to establish control within the department going forward. I feel this is my major responsibility at present. However, this is an unprecedented major case for the army, and its impact is very serious. We must pay close attention to it. The details of the crime are currently being investigated by a court-martial and are not yet suitable for discussion. As for the follow-up measures, I did not make any statements on the cabinet floor today, but I am considering appropriate measures. Prime Minister Okada also said that he would do his best to find a solution and expressed hopes for a proper resolution and offered words of encouragement." (15th Japan United Press)</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Decides: Crackdown on Strange Documents; Will Be Made into Law and Strictly Enforced; Army Minister Hayashi Visits Prime Minister Okada Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) When Army Minister Hayashi explained the reasons for the assassination of Bureau Chief Nagata at the cabinet meeting on the 15th, he said, "Blindly following the contents of strange documents" led to this unfortunate incident. These strange documents were clearly the cause of the incident. Therefore, as a result of repeated discussions, the cabinet decided that the crackdown on these strange documents must be strictly enforced. It was agreed that relevant ministries, such as the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Justice, would study the matter in detail and then submit it as a bill to the next session of the Diet. It is also reported that those who issue these strange documents will be subject to substantial penalties, and enforcement will be strict. (15th Japan United Press)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Army Minister Hayashi visited Prime Minister Okada at 9:30 AM on the 15th to report on the details of the assassination of Major General Nagata and the interrogation of Lieutenant Colonel Aizawa, the perpetrator. He then explained his determination, saying that the assassination of the Military Affairs Bureau Chief was extremely regrettable for the control of the military. He felt greatly responsible. However, due to the seriousness of the situation, he did not want to be constrained by the issue of responsibility and was determined to actively implement follow-up measures to rectify military discipline in order to strengthen the control of the military. Once all goals have been achieved and the incident resolved, he would take full responsibility and decide on his future course. Prime Minister Okada replied that the cabinet unanimously hoped that the Army Minister would remain in his position and encouraged him to advance the goal of controlling the national army. (15th Japan United Press)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Army Minister Hayashi explained the assassination of Major General Nagata and his policy on controlling the military at the cabinet meeting on the 14th. After the meeting, he immediately summoned Vice-Minister Hashimoto and Military Affairs Bureau Chief Imai to his official residence to discuss how to control the military. According to Army Minister Hayashi's opinion, a perfunctory formal instruction would be ineffective. Therefore, he ordered Vice-Minister Hashimoto to study the most effective concrete methods for controlling the military as soon as possible. After receiving the order, Hashimoto immediately discussed concrete methods with Military Affairs Bureau Chief Imai, Chief of the Preparation Bureau Yamaoka, and Chief of the Personnel Bureau Koumiya. It is reported that the content is as follows: (1) Convene a meeting of army commanders and division commanders. (2) Convene a meeting of regimental commanders. (3) Convene a meeting of chiefs of staff. (4) Convey instructions on clearing the military to the three chiefs. However, as the army personnel had not been transferred for long, and because of Nagata's sudden death and Imai's newly appointed position as Military Affairs Bureau Chief, the successor affairs could not be carried out quickly, and various affairs were difficult to handle. Therefore, convening the various meetings mentioned above will take considerable time. Army Minister Hayashi also believes that reforming the upper-level personnel of the military is the most urgent matter for controlling the military, and he plans to express his determination to the other two chiefs within days to implement the reform. (15th Japan United Press)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Army Minister Hayashi hinted to Prime Minister Okada that he intended to resign after the incident had come to a close. As a result, all parties are paying close attention. Although Prime Minister Okada and the cabinet members earnestly requested that Army Minister Hayashi remain in his position, Army Minister Hayashi's intention to resign is firm. Therefore, his resignation may be a matter of time. (15th Den-tsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is rumored that Army Minister Hayashi expressed his intention to resign at the meeting of the three chiefs, so his resignation has most likely become a matter of time. However, the special army commander and division commander meeting for the initial handling of this incident will be held at the end of August, so he is unlikely to submit his resignation this month. As for the successor to the Army Minister, it is planned that General Watanabe, the Director-General of Military Education, will succeed him. It is also planned to have Military Councilor General Kawashima or General Abe Nobuyuki succeed as Director-General of Military Education. If the two generals decline, General Terauchi, commander of the Taiwan Army, will be recommended. (15th Den-tsu Dispatch)</p>
<h3>British and French First Agree on the Principles of the Tripartite Conference; Based on the 1929 Exchange of Notes between Britain and Italy; As the Basis for Negotiations on the Italian-Abyssinian Question</h3>
<p>(Paris) According to reliable sources, British cabinet minister Eden has agreed with French Prime Minister Laval on the key points of the tripartite conference on the Abyssinian issue, namely: (1) Handling the Italian-Abyssinian dispute purely within the framework of the League of Nations. (2) France will not interfere in the negotiations between Britain and Italy. During the talks, both expressed deep concern about maintaining peace and fulfilling the obligations of the League of Nations, and both believed that the tripartite conference could provide a final opportunity to reach a peaceful solution before the League of Nations' meeting on September 4. Eden clearly stated at the time that if war broke out in Africa, it would inevitably lead to broader events in Europe and elsewhere. British public opinion on the issue of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute can be said to be consistent.</p>
<p>The French government has learned of Britain's plan to grant Italy economic concessions in Abyssinia. The content of this plan has not yet been disclosed, but it is said to be consistent with (1) the 1906 treaty guaranteeing the territorial integrity of Abyssinia and delineating the spheres of influence of the three countries, and (2) the 1928 Italian-Abyssinian treaty and the League of Nations Covenant. In 1925, Britain and Italy exchanged notes in which Italy recognized Britain's right to dispose of Lake Tana, and Britain did not object to Italy's plan to build railways in the hinterland of Eritrea and Italian Somaliland. This document can now serve as the basis for negotiations. What is necessary is to persuade Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to accept the rights granted by Britain and France to Italy to develop colonial enterprises. It is now expected that Britain and France will use their influence to persuade the Abyssinian Emperor to grant these rights to Italy. At yesterday's talks, Laval was assisted by the political director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Bargeton, while Eden was assisted by the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Sir Vansittart.</p>
<p>Italian representative Baron Aloisi is expected to arrive in Paris today and will meet with the French Prime Minister. Representatives from France, Britain, and Italy will begin formal talks on Friday as scheduled. Last night, Laval held talks with the Greek Minister to Paris, Politis. Politis has been appointed as the fifth arbitrator of the arbitration committee for the Walwal incident. The committee had previously been suspended due to differences of opinion between the parties and is now resuming its work. (15th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Italian Representative Arrives in Paris: Will Meet with Laval Immediately</h3>
<p>(Paris) Italian representative Aloisi, along with his entourage, arrived here from Italy at 9:35 AM today to participate in the tripartite conference between Britain, France, and Italy. Aloisi then went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 11:00 AM to meet with French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval, and the talks ended at 12:20 PM. (15th Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) Italian chief representative Aloisi arrived here this morning and immediately went to meet with French Prime Minister Laval for an hour and fifteen minutes. No one else was present at the time. The content of the talks is unknown. The French Prime Minister later told reporters that the tripartite conference would begin tomorrow, and Laval would meet with British representative Eden again this afternoon. (15th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to sources from Havas, Italian representative Aloisi vigorously defended Italy's position during his talks with Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval this morning, saying that Italy, due to its increasing population, cannot accommodate it within its own borders, so it must obtain political privileges in Abyssinia. Furthermore, to defend Italian Somaliland and Eritrea, it is also necessary to obtain such political privileges. Merely obtaining economic privileges is not sufficient. Italy has now sent 170,000 troops to concentrate in its East African territories. If a satisfactory peaceful solution cannot be obtained, it is prepared to intervene militarily at any time. As for the scope of Italy's demands for resolving the dispute, it will only be put forward after the tripartite conference opens tomorrow. Furthermore, Italy mobilized another 50,000 troops yesterday. Italy is determined to uphold its original position, which can be seen here. Laval will now report Aloisi's statement to British Minister without Portfolio Eden this afternoon. Italy has indicated that it must obtain political privileges, while Britain opposes political concessions. The positions of the two countries are clearly divergent. It is generally believed that Laval will reconcile the views of Britain and Italy and find a compromise solution, advocating a peaceful resolution to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute and granting Italy substantial benefits.

<p>(Rome) The semi-official "Foreign Affairs Report" commented on the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, saying, "Giving Abyssinia an outlet to the Red Sea, restricting Abyssinia's economic concessions, and entrusting the League of Nations with governance are all means to disguise Britain's trusteeship in Abyssinia. To reach a compromise resolution of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, it is necessary to abandon the above methods." The report also said that while Italy recognizes the treaty-based rights of Britain, Italy is unwilling to use Italian blood as the price of expanding the British Empire. The report then enumerated various actions by Britain that lack friendship towards Italy, such as inciting Abyssinia to mobilize its troops, threatening to block the Suez Canal, and increasing the garrison troops in British territories near Abyssinia. The report said, "The reason why Britain does not want Italy's power to penetrate Abyssinia is that if there is an opportunity, Britain will engulf Abyssinia and occupy it. Britain intends to impoverish Italy, so that the raw materials needed by Italy will have to rely on the British Empire. However, Italy is not afraid of this threat. Recalling 105 years ago, when France launched an expedition to Algiers in Africa, Britain also made similar incitements, which shows that this is Britain's habitual trick, so what should we fear?"

<h3>Italy and Abyssinia: Still Undertaking Military Actions</h3>
<p>(Rome) Prime Minister Mussolini has recently approved the organization of volunteer Blackshirt units by Italians residing abroad for deployment to East Africa. These units will consist of four battalions, each with 1,000 men, led by Ballini, the leader of the association of Italians abroad. To date, as many as 11,000 Italians residing abroad have volunteered for military service. However, because medical examinations are very thorough, only 4,000 people have been formally formed into units. (14th Havas)</p>
<p>(Rome) Prime Minister Mussolini has conscripted 200,000 reservists from the classes of 1911, 1913, and 1914. These three classes of soldiers were previously exempt from service, but it has not been announced whether they will be deployed to Africa. (14th National Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Anti-Jewish Rally Held in Berlin: Over 40 Catholic Graves Destroyed</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Tonight, the Sportpalast in Berlin will host the largest anti-Jewish rally ever held in Germany. It is expected that 25,000 members of the National Socialist Party will attend. Julius Streicher, Germany's most famous anti-Jewish journalist, will address the crowd. The meeting is scheduled to begin at 8:30 PM, and all seats have been sold out. Tonight, there are four other anti-Jewish meetings being held in Berlin. Jewish leaders, fearing that their co-religionists are at risk of unexpected danger, have advised them not to enter cafes or even walk on the streets tonight. Today, a newspaper published an article stating that a total of 500,000 German Jews have registered, with about 160,000 in Berlin. (15th Japan United Press)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today, over 40 graves were destroyed in a Catholic cemetery in the town of Chamtauf in Upper Palatinate. The wooden crosses in front of the graves of poor Catholics were broken or uprooted. In Breslau, members of the National Socialist Party's stormtroopers paraded through the city in eight cargo trucks, carrying a giant paper-mâché effigy of a Catholic priest suspended from a guillotine. Those in the trucks shouted slogans denouncing Catholics and Jews. The mayor of Dortmund today prohibited Jews from pawning items at municipal pawnshops. The authorities in Waldenburg in southwestern Germany ordered Jews to be prohibited from participating in the sale of livestock. (14th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The National Socialist Party's official newspaper, *Völkischer Beobachter*, recently published statistics on Jews, stating that "one-third of the Jews residing in Germany live in Berlin. There are a total of 499,682 Jews in Germany, of which about 4% of Berlin's total population reside in Berlin. This ratio is only second to that of the city of Frankfurt, because Frankfurt is a well-known Jewish city, with Jews accounting for about 5% of the city's total population. (14th Havas)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The political police authorities in Württemberg recently ordered the general dissolution of Catholic youth groups in Leobrand, Neckarsulm, Balingen, and Eppingen, and prohibited any further such organizations.

More than 400 special trains will be needed. It is now believed that the congress will absorb 250,000 members of other organizations, so the total number of participants will be approximately 650,000, making it the largest congress ever held in Europe. Prime Minister Hitler has ordered that the congress be named the "Congress of Freedom." Last year's congress was named "Triumph of the Will." (14th National Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>Telegram from Tongling County, Anhui, Requesting Relief - To the Shanghai Shen Bao Newspaper Office: The people of Tongling have been afflicted by Heaven and are now suffering from floods. This summer, the upper reaches of the Yangtze River experienced torrential floods, and all the counties along the river in our Anhui have suffered. Tongling County has always been known as having "three mountains and seven weirs." The dikes of all sizes throughout the county are arranged like scales. Since (month omitted), officials and civilians have been guarding them day and night, sparing no effort. However, the water level increased day by day, and with the intrusion of strong winds, more than fifty large and small dikes eventually collapsed, inundating over 90,000 mu of land and causing approximately 800,000 yuan in agricultural losses. More than 8,000 households, totaling over 40,000 people, were affected, accounting for an estimated one-quarter of the county's population. 5,000 houses were destroyed, and countless livestock and farming tools were lost. People are scattered and displaced, eating in the wind and sleeping in the dew, their cries and lamentations unbearable to hear. Autumn is approaching, and our sorrow deepens. In the past, when the weirs and villages suffered disasters, they could still seek food in the mountain villages. But now, the mountain villages have not yet recovered from the severe drought of the previous year and cannot even take care of themselves. Moreover, there has been no rain for forty days, and a drought is looming, which is even more worrying. Therefore, although the water level may be lower than in the twentieth year of the Republic, the disaster is actually more severe. The county magistrate and others are heartbroken and are urgently seeking relief. In addition to establishing a disaster relief committee to actively handle relief work, we have prepared tables listing the affected weirs and respectfully request relief. We specially request your newspaper to appeal on our behalf so that charitable organizations and generous benefactors can provide aid and food to save the disaster-stricken people. We are filled with anticipation. Attached is a table (omitted). With respectful regards, the Tongling County Government, County Party Headquarters, People's Food Regulation Committee Branch, Finance Committee, Chambers of Commerce, Farmers' Associations, Educational Associations, Changpingcang Granary General Branch and various branches, Education Bureau, District Public Offices, all respectfully kowtow and stamp.</p>
<p>A Record of Inspecting Flood Conditions Along the Rivers - A Glimpse of the Disaster Along the Pinghan Railway</p>
<p>The steamer from Tianmen to Hankou departed at 3:00 AM. Passing by the Diaochahu Lake, bays intertwined, and reeds grew densely. It was once the nest of the Red area in central Hubei. Tianmen's four townships were also deeply infiltrated by communism in the past. Since its recovery three years ago, the local authorities have worked hard on construction and have earned a reputation as a model county. Unexpectedly, the god of the river caused trouble, and everything was swept away again. Such a huge change in fortune! In a country where human power cannot control nature, the consequences are unpredictable. Leaving the lake and entering the river channel, the villages on the shore that have not been washed away are already inhabited by returning disaster victims. Some are transporting bricks and shoveling mud to repair broken houses (the majority), while others are sunning and threshing spoiled wheat, hoping to satisfy their hunger with the remaining grains. Survivors of the disaster all wear sad expressions. Hawks and crows, looking around at the vast expanse of water, have all become waterfowl. I could only fly along the embankment to find special food, my beak dripping with muddy blood, I couldn't bear to think about what I was eating. I arrived in Hankou at dusk. The green willows and tall buildings on both sides of the river were bathed in the afterglow of the setting sun. The scenery was beautiful, and the men and women were enjoying the cool air, as if there was no sound of the Jianghan River converging and surging, which slightly moved people's hearts. I am afraid that those who are intoxicated by the leisurely life of brocade clothes and jade food in the city will no longer remember that there are still thousands upon thousands of starving disaster victims in the world. As the ship docked, before the passengers could disembark, more than a dozen male and female disaster victims rushed forward and squeezed their way onto the ship, eager to board. The ship police stopped them and asked, "Where are you going?" They replied sadly, "We want to go downstream (referring to various places downstream) to escape the disaster." The ship police continued, "There are also floods in the next few provinces. Where is a good place to go? Besides, this is a ship specifically for Tianmen, not a ship going down the Yangtze River." One person pleaded, "We also just escaped from Tianmen two days ago. We sat by the river for two days, and no one took us in. One of our companions went to beg for food and disappeared. The rest of us are afraid of getting lost and dare not leave. We are so hungry that we have to sell our clothes for two or eight hundred coins to buy rice to cook porridge. We really can't stand the hunger anymore, so we want to escape to a better place in the next few provinces. Please do a good deed." The ship police shouted angrily, "The ship is not doing good deeds. Get out of here!" A passenger interjected, "Why don't you (referring to the disaster victims) pull rickshaws?" Immediately, a rickshaw puller who was hustling for business replied, "Brother, I have been in Hankou for three or four years, and I am still not familiar with the streets of the concession. Newcomers from the countryside want to pull rickshaws? Humph, that's easy!" In addition, there were those who suggested registering with the Hubei Flood Relief Association, and those who advised them to beg for alms from various charitable organizations. The discussions were chaotic and resembled drawing cakes to satisfy hunger, and ultimately did not provide any practical help to the displaced disaster victims.</p>
<p>That night, I took the Pinghan train north. Near the Dazhimen station, no less than hundreds of residents were sleeping naked under the shade of the trees. The area was full of accumulated water and weeds, which easily bred flies and mosquitoes. Sleeping in the open air was certainly cool, but ultimately not conducive to hygiene. But compared to the disaster victims huddled together on the banks of the (omitted) water, exposed to the sun and steam during the day and fearing the arrival of storms again at night, these people were no less than resting in a peaceful paradise. A Mr. Wang from Huangpi in the seat, told of the flood in his county, saying, "On the seventh day of July, suddenly there was a strong wind and rain, and the rice seedlings by the lake were completely submerged. The Xiang River also suddenly rose sharply, rushing and surging, and successively washed away the Minsheng Sanyang and other (omitted) dikes. More than 100,000 mu of farmland in the southwest of the county town were inundated, and 150,000 to 60,000 people were affected. Some lived on the hills, exposed to the wind and dew, while others clung to the rooftops, shaken by the waves. Others gathered in the county town, overflowing the streets. Everyone was emaciated and covered in mud, in a terrible state. The men cried and the women wailed, which was unbearable to hear. Recently, as the water has gradually receded, the higher ground can be replanted with buckwheat, but the low-lying areas will likely be difficult to replant. If the soil is sandy, radishes and sweet potatoes can be planted, but seeds and fertilizer are a problem everywhere. I urgently hope that agricultural relief will arrive in time, or there may be a glimmer of hope."</p>
<p>At midnight, I arrived in Xiaogan. Disaster victims who had been waiting for a long time, supporting the old and carrying the young, swarmed into the military car. Although there were road police outside scolding and soldiers inside rejecting them, (omitted) the disaster victims struggled for their last chance of survival. Relying on the strength of the crowd, they used all kinds of methods, both soft and hard, and finally achieved the goal of riding the train for free without paying a fare. They were also fortunate enough to be among the soldiers who had previously wanted to reject them (soldiers also do not buy tickets for slow trains). It can also be said that there was a lot of luck. According to the first, second, and third districts of Xiaogan, which are located in the low-lying areas in the south, at the intersection of the Huanshui and Yunshui rivers, the water outlet for (omitted) the counties of Yunmeng, Yingcheng, and Tianmen. Wherever the lakes and streams reached, everything became a swamp. The Phoenix Terrace, one of the so-called eight scenic spots in Xiaogan, was built during the Xianfeng period of the Qing Dynasty. It towers into the clouds and has never been submerged, but this time the water level even reached the steps. The loss of fields, houses, livestock, and people in low-lying areas was naturally unavoidable. In addition, the stele of "The Hometown of Dong Yong, the Filial Piety of the Han Dynasty" is still intact outside the city. The disaster victims seemed to value historical sites more than their lives, so they praised it endlessly.</p>
<p>The next morning, passing through Wusheng Pass, the mountain was cut open and a tunnel was built, which is the first large mountain passed by the Pinghan Railway. The south of the tunnel is the territory of Yingshan County, Hubei, and the north of the tunnel is the territory of Xinyang County, Henan. In the past, the north and south were (omitted) governed separately, and this was once the boundary. Next to it is the Drumming Terrace. During the Spring and Autumn Period, King Zhuang of Chu refused to fight Yue Jiao and personally beat the drums here, hence the name. About ten miles north is the Xindian Station. Fourteen miles east of the station is Jigong Mountain, with towering peaks and verdant clouds and mist. Westerners have built many buildings on the top of the mountain in the name of the church, making it a summer resort comparable to Lushan Mountain. To the west of the station, there are giant rocks of fifty or sixty feet, scattered on the ridge in a soaring posture, hence the name Longpao Mountain (Dragon Running Mountain). It is said that there is still a fairy's boot in the belly of the mountain, a stone boot shape, ingeniously made by nature. At the foot of the mountain there is a stone drum, which makes a loud sound when struck. From here, the trees are shady, the fragrant grass covers the ground, and the red beans and yellow millet are especially beautiful and lovely.</p>
<p>The train passed through Xinyang and stopped for a long time. The county is the cultural and commercial center of southern Henan. Although mountain floods have erupted, it has not suffered from floods due to its superior terrain. Exports include grains, cotton, cowhide, bamboo ware, and chicken and duck eggs. For middle and high school education, there is one provincial senior normal school and one county junior middle school. The authorities of each school, in view of the fact that the four townships and neighboring areas of the county had been reduced to communist areas in the past, take an interventionist approach to extracurricular activities and a strict approach to all regular courses in order to prevent students from becoming radical in their thinking. Smoking is also prohibited on weekdays, and violators are severely punished. However, if teachers and staff do not lead by example, I am afraid that the results may not be satisfactory. In the city there is a tower called Chaoyang Tower, more than ten feet high, built during the Zhengde period of the Ming Dynasty. There is a well under the tower, which is rare in other places. A few miles west of the station is the Zigong Temple, with the words "The Former Sage Zigong was the Minister here" inscribed on the stele.</p>
<p>The train passed Queshan and arrived at Zhumadian, which is very prosperous in commerce and is a distribution center for goods in the vicinity. More than ten miles east of the station, the mountains are rugged, and there is a so-called ancient city. It is said that this is where Guan Yu beheaded Cai Yang. Cai Yang's tomb is still there today. There is a Zhang Mingfu Temple in the city, dedicated to Zhang Xi of the Eastern Han Dynasty. Xi was the magistrate of Pingyu in Caizhou. There was a great drought and he prayed for rain but it did not come. He burned himself with firewood, and then the sky rained heavily. The people were grateful for his virtue and built a temple to worship him. Although Xi's self-immolation was close to superstition, he was still a worthy official on the historical record. However, since Dayu's water control, which achieved great achievements, the history of disasters for thousands of years has been almost entirely a record of droughts and floods. Especially in this era of scientific advancement, water conservancy agencies in various places are springing up like mushrooms after rain, and spending increases every year to prevent floods and droughts, but droughts and floods still occur every year. The competent authorities are responsible and cannot shirk their responsibility. I don't know how they can justify themselves. A robbery occurred at the Xindian Station a month ago. First, bandits disguised themselves as passengers, bought tickets and entered the station. When the train arrived at the station, they each took out small pistols hidden in their sleeves, and divided up the key points of each car. The road police were caught off guard and could not respond, and eleven rifles were taken away. Fortunately, no other passengers were injured or lost property. Now, the Xinyang to Juan City section has been assigned additional road police to strictly prevent and control the situation, and there is no danger. Juan City has fertile soil and is all plains. This time, due to the floods of the Shahe and Luohe rivers, many fields and crops were submerged. As the train entered the county, there was standing water everywhere, and the roots of the crops were still submerged in the water by several inches. Those that were damaged by the rushing torrents have also been replanted with buckwheat where the water has receded. Fortunately, the county seat was not flooded, and only a few people and animals in the four townships were lost. However, there was a great loss of grain. Traveling north from Juan City, passing through Meng Temple Village to Xiaoshang Bridge, the roadbed of the railway had been washed away for more than 20 miles. In one section, about four miles long, the entire roadbed was washed away, and the rails were empty, like a bridge. Half a month ago, train traffic was blocked because of this. It has now been repaired with extra effort, but the roadbed has been filled and the stone ballast has not been laid, so the train runs slowly and softly. After passing this section, it speeds up again as before.</p>
<p>Commerce and education in Juan City are no less developed than in Xinyang in southern Henan. The Luowan River Town, about a mile southeast of the city, is crowded with boats, and hundreds of merchants gather, making it more prosperous than the county seat. The main exports are sesame, soybeans, cowhide, and paulownia wood. In the past, paulownia wood was sold exclusively to Japan, but in recent years it has declined. Primary and secondary schools in the city are well-developed, but the four townships are very conservative, and the custom of foot binding has not yet been completely changed. There is a Gui Village Town in the eastern township, which is where Confucius thought of returning while in Chen. Outside the east gate there is also a stele erected during the Qing Dynasty commemorating Confucius's thoughts of returning.</p>
<h3>Fujian Province - Relief for Floods and Plague - Wind and Rain Cause Disasters in Southern and Eastern Fujian - Plague Discovered in Northern and Western Fujian</h3>
<p>Fuzhou News, This time, due to wind and rain, the counties of Putian, Xianyou, Hui'an, Jinjiang, Nan'an, Yongchun, Tong'an, Anxi, Longxi in Southern Fujian, and Lianjiang and Nanri in Eastern Fujian, suffered disasters. People and livestock were swept away, houses collapsed, fields and crops were destroyed, trees were broken, roads were damaged, and countless bridges were destroyed. The provincial government has received reports from various counties every day. In total, no less than 100,000 people have been affected, and the losses are estimated at over 10 million yuan. The severity of the disaster and the extent of the affected area are unprecedented in recent decades. In terms of roads, the Construction Department has instructed the Putian-Hua'an, Quanzhou, and Zhangzhou Highway Engineering Offices to repair the roads in sections as quickly as possible, which is expected to take two weeks. In addition to the cost of labor and materials, which will require more than 200,000 yuan, the Chairman of the Provincial Government, Chen Yi, convened the Chairman of the Relief Committee, Chen Peikun, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department, Gao Dengting, and others to discuss relief measures. It was decided that the various counties should quickly investigate and report the actual situation of the disaster. The Civil Affairs Department should send two inspectors, He Jing and Chen Huanglin, to the various counties in Southern and Eastern Fujian to conduct on-the-spot investigations of the disaster situation, so as to plan relief measures in a coordinated manner. The Relief Committee should first raise 10,000 yuan to handle urgent relief, specifically to help the homeless disaster victims, with 2,000 yuan for Anxi, 1,500 yuan each for Hui'an, Tong'an, Jinjiang, Longxi, and Nan'an, 1,000 yuan for Lianjiang, and 500 yuan for Nanri. It will then report to the Central Relief Committee and request the allocation of a large sum of money for relief. The report stated, "Since the end of last month, Fujian Province has experienced two hurricanes and rainstorms. It only calmed down slightly on Geng day. According to reports from the Fourth and Fifth District Administrative Commissioners and the county magistrates of Hui'an, Anxi, Longxi, Jinjiang, Lianjiang, Nan'an, and other counties, after the wind disaster, there was a mountain flood with water over ten feet high, and the cities became swamps. People, livestock, food, and houses were swept away, and the disaster was extremely severe, unprecedented in decades. Telephone lines were damaged, ships were grounded, roads were washed away, and all transportation was cut off. The disaster situation in the coastal counties has not yet been fully reported, and it may be even more tragic. We have sent personnel to take detours to investigate and are planning to provide urgent relief. However, Fujian Province has suffered from banditry for many years, and the people are already deeply impoverished. Although it has been gradually settled, the wounds have not healed and vitality is depleted. They have suffered another partial disaster, how can the people bear it? The only thing to do is to quickly allocate a large sum of relief money to Fujian for relief and to ease their suffering. According to investigations, this flood occurred during the fruiting and ripening season of late rice and seasonal fruits, all of which were swept away by the typhoon. The farmers suffered the greatest losses, and their livelihoods in the second half of the year will be affected." In addition, a plague broke out in Yanping in Northern Fujian and Longyan in Western Fujian a month ago. In Northern Fujian, after the government and social organizations jointly established an epidemic prevention association to help treat the disease, the epidemic situation has gradually subsided in recent days. However, in Western Fujian, due to the major battles last year, corpses were scattered everywhere and many were not collected, causing the atmosphere to become increasingly severe, and the number of deaths increased daily. The provincial government has ordered all medical teams in Western Fujian to concentrate in Longyan to help treat the disease. It also telegraphed the Ministry of Health to send experts to Fujian to preside over the epidemic prevention efforts as soon as possible. Yesterday, the ministry sent Yang Yongnian, a technician from the ministry and director of the inspection institute of the Health Department of the Economic Commission, along with medical officers Lin Jiarui, He Zhiguang, and Wang Deying, carrying a large amount of medicine, to Fujian from Shanghai. They met with Chairman Chen, stated the epidemic prevention policy, and scheduled to take a boat to Xiamen on the 15th, then transfer to Western Fujian to engage in epidemic prevention work. The provincial government also telegraphed the Zhangzhou Pacification Command to assist in the progress after Yang arrives. (August 14th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province - Remaining Bandits in the Eastern District Eliminated - Time Limit for All Counties to Organize Baojia - Reorganization of Regular and Reserve Police Forces</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Communication, In recent days, Guangdong Province has vigorously implemented the Baojia system, conducted household registration in various villages, and reported bandits, so that bandits have nowhere to hide. At the same time, four Pacification Commands were established in the northwest, southeast, and central regions to carry out Pacification work. In the eastern district, because a few bandits from the Kun, Lian, and Jiangxi borders and the Fujian border fled to Phoenix Mountain in Raoping and Nanshan at the junction of Jieyang and Chaoyang, the defense forces of the eastern district have repeatedly sent teams to search and suppress them. It has now been found that a group near Raoping, after being surrounded and suppressed by Zeng Youren's Brigade of the First Independent Division under Huang Renhuan, captured more than 40 bandits and seized more than 100 rifles. They have recently been eliminated one by one. As for the bandits in Nanshan, the Ninth Division has also dispatched teams to search for them separately. Communist Party fake organizations such as the Dongjiang Special Committee, the County Soviet, and repair shops, grain bureaus, and post offices have all been destroyed. The bandit leader Gu Dacun has now fled, and more than 30 other notorious bandits, including Yuan Xinyun, Lai Yuheng, Xie Ronghua, Zeng Jiuhua, and Lin Sanji, have surrendered. Among those captured were Tao Yao, Chen Gengguang, He Fusheng, Xu Zigui, Tian Leguang, and the female bandit Wu Yingdi, totaling more than 70 people. Those killed included the female bandit Zeng Yulian and the bandit leaders Zhang Mukui, Gu Hanming, and Luo Pinghan. The Eastern District Pacification Command has now sent letters to the governments of all counties, setting a deadline of the end of August for the completion of the Baojia organization in each county. The steps for handling this are roughly divided into three items: (1) The county should immediately appoint personnel to supervise the district and township chiefs in the county to complete the Baojia organization before the end of August in accordance with the Baojia Regulations. (2) If district and township chiefs or people in the district delay or deliberately resist the organization of Baojia, they should be strictly investigated. (3) After the Baojia is organized in each county and district, the roster should be submitted to the government in charge for future reference, so that personnel can be sent to conduct random checks. As for the district and township guard teams, they have also been reorganized recently. If the captains of the regular guard teams in each middle and small team are deemed to have insufficient knowledge and are unqualified, they should be trained or replaced immediately. If the soldiers in the regular team are all of foreign nationality, efforts should be made to gradually promote the conscription system. The soldiers should be trained in rotation. As for the reserve team, the training in academic subjects should follow balanced instruction and should not focus on technical subjects, etc.</p>
<h3>Songjiang - The Reaction to the Brokerage Fee Demands of the Firewood Guild</h3>
<p>The residents of Songjiang County use rice straw and chaff as fuel. Farmers in the suburbs often carry firewood to sell, while farmers from further away transport it by boat to the urban area for sale. There are also people from Jiangbei who transport and sell it. However, the firewood guilds, relying on having a license from the Finance Department, would detain firewood boats and demand brokerage fees. The farmers could not bear this harassment. The County Chamber of Commerce discussed this at the 24th Executive Committee meeting, stating that there is a difference between farmers selling firewood and chaff and those who specialize in selling it. How can they be forced to pay brokerage fees, disrupting tranquility? It was decided to submit a request to the County Government to instruct the Public Security Bureau to send police to suppress this practice in order to provide relief.</p>
<h3>Suzhou - Old Man Sentenced for Rape of Young Girl</h3>
<p>The case of Wang Renchang, a 67-year-old man, raping Han Xingbao, a 13-year-old girl, has been investigated by the Public Security Bureau and handed over to the local court for trial. The trial has now concluded and the verdict was delivered yesterday. Wang Renchang was sentenced to three years imprisonment. Wang Renchang refused to accept the verdict and attempted suicide in court. The bailiffs took Wang away and sent him back to the detention center.</p>
<h3>Wuxi - Xinxin Fire Causes Tens of Thousands in Losses</h3>
<p>Yesterday (15th) morning at 6:00 AM, a fire broke out due to an electrical fault on the second-story loft of the Xinxin Silk Store on North Main Street. The fire spread to the floor below. Fortunately, the store had its own pump and water tank and immediately used fire hydrants to extinguish the fire. By the time the various fire brigades arrived to help extinguish the fire, the fire had already been brought under control. As a result, four rooms on the loft floor had their roofs burned through. Including the water damage, the losses were estimated at 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. Fortunately, the store had fire insurance worth 70,000 yuan from Baolong, Shenchang, Huanqiu, and other companies, so the losses were not too great. Yesterday, the store sorted out the goods and was temporarily closed for one day. It will reopen as usual today.</p>
<h3>Visiting Relatives and Being Humiliated Leads to Hanging Suicide</h3>
<p>Zhu Liu, a woman from Cangqiao Township, Yanqiao Town, Fifth District, was over 50 years old. She had three sons and one daughter. Her daughter, Rongxiu, was married to Gao A'shi, a resident of Gaojiaqiao. However, A'shi's mother, Gao, was quite fierce and often scolded Rongxiu. Rongxiu told her mother, Zhu Liu, about the abuse. Zhu went to negotiate, which started with an argument and then turned into a physical fight. As a result, both sides were injured. After being persuaded by neighbors, the conflict subsided. However, after Liu returned home, she became overwhelmed with anger and conceived a hatred for the world. She hanged herself the day before yesterday. The Fifth District Tutu Zheng, Zhou Longhui, reported this to the court for investigation. Yesterday (15th) morning at 8:00 AM, the acting prosecutor went to the countryside to conduct an autopsy. It was determined that she had committed suicide by hanging. It was ordered that the corpse's family prepare a coffin for burial, pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Wujin Second-Hand Clothing Stores Forced to Pay Brokerage Fees</h3>
<p>The Wujin County Chamber of Commerce has been negotiating with the Wujin Pawn Industry and the Fengji Second-Hand Clothing Store. Yesterday, it sent a telegram to the Provincial Government, the Department of Finance, and the Department of Construction, stating that the nature of a brokerage is to act as an agent for buying and selling, which refers to customers from outside the area, not to those who are already established in the area. It also implies that the brokerage guarantees outside customers for local businesses, so the commission is a matter of rights and obligations. If pawnshops sell goods that have been fully redeemed to clothing stores, both parties are already established businesses and should be free to buy and sell. Why should the brokerage force them to pay? This is obviously disrupting commerce. We dare to send a telegram to ask for your review and verification, to quickly order a strict prohibition to ensure the safety of the commercial market and to prevent others from following suit.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing: The Truth About the Disappearance of the Proprietor of a Business Going East</h3>
<p>Zhang Wenxin (17 years old), son of Zhang Guangfeng, proprietor of Litong Fengji Carriage Company at Chunbo Bridge, Jiaxing, went out on the morning of the 11th to collect carriage rentals and then disappeared. Guangfeng searched everywhere, but his whereabouts were unknown. At noon, a blackmail letter signed "Gao Xiaoguai" arrived, demanding 500 yuan. After reporting to the river and land police corps for investigation, river and land police officers arrested Xu Tingzhang's son Xu Demao, and Zhang Dingtong, who often associated with Wenxin, for questioning. Later, Xu Tingzhang (a Yancheng native who raises ducks) was arrested and interrogated. It was then learned that Zhang Wenxin was waiting at Xucun Station. An officer from the First Public Security Bureau took police officers on the 14th to bring Zhang Wenxin back for questioning. It was then learned that Wenxin's departure was masterminded by Xu Demao (because Zhang Wenxin had been beaten by his father a few days earlier). Wenxin's erhu (Chinese violin), a pair of leather shoes, and a 500-foot flashlight were also found in Xu's residence. The handwriting of the blackmail letter also resembled Xu Demao's. Therefore, the case has now become clear: it was entirely instigated by Xu Demao alone, and Zhang Dingtong seemed to have little involvement. Currently, the county government believes that because there is a blackmail letter in the case, all the witnesses must be sent to the court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Morphia Den Cracked in the North of the City</h3>
<p>A morphia-selling den was located at No. 16, Zhao Cheng North City Foot. It was cracked by the Chengqu Public Security Bureau. The seller, Xu Guangyuan, was arrested along with the evidence and transferred to the Main Bureau, which in turn transferred him to the Fourth District Security Command for military trial.</p>
<h3>Jinsha: Unclear Cause of Death of a Young Woman</h3>
<p>Gu Buou of Jinsha engaged Zhang Shuizhen as his wife. The wedding date was set, but Zhang suddenly died under unclear circumstances. After Gu inquired, he learned that his fiancée had been having an affair with his nephew, Zhang Zuyin, and had an abortion before the wedding, which led to her death. He sued the court. The prosecutor's office sent police to Jinsha to transport Zhang Shuizhen's coffin to the city for an exhumation and autopsy.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan: Bumper Harvest of New Grain, Rice Prices Plunge</h3>
<p>Farmers in the fourth district of Xiaoshan planted early rice everywhere. This summer, the weather was favorable, with adequate sunshine and rain, and the crops were not damaged by wind and rain during the flowering season. As a result, the grains are plump and the panicles are especially long. During the harvest a few days ago, each mu (unit of area) yielded three shi (unit of volume) of unhusked rice. The abundance of the harvest is rarely seen in previous years. Farmers are all overjoyed. Furthermore, rice shops in Linpu saw new grain from Zhuji and the local area entering the market due to the bumper harvest. Currently, the supply of goods is surging, and the price of rice has been reduced by 1.5 yuan. New rice is priced at 6.8 yuan per shi, and old rice is sold at 7.4 yuan per shi, a decrease of more than 3 yuan compared to last winter. This is good news for the future of people's food.</p>

<h3>Shanghai-Wuxi Highway Grand Opening Ceremony Yesterday; Ribbon-cutting in Nanxiang in the Morning, Banquet in Changshu at Noon; Chairman Chen Hosts Guests in Wuxi in the Evening; Long-distance Buses Scheduled to Start Operating on the 17th</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Wuxi Highway, jointly built by the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department and the Shanghai Municipal Government, is 140 kilometers long. Construction began last year in sections and has recently been completed. A grand ribbon-cutting ceremony was held at Guyi Garden in Nanxiang at 8:00 AM on the 15th. Three to four thousand people from Shanghai, Changshu, and Wuxi attended. The Shanghai-Wuxi Motor Company provided vehicles to welcome and transport guests. A banquet was held in Changshu at noon to entertain guests visiting Yushan Mountain and other scenic spots. Chairman Chen hosted a banquet for company directors Zhang Gongquan, Wang Xiaolai, and others at Yiyuan in Wuxi in the evening. The company's passenger buses are scheduled to begin operating on the 17th. The grand opening ceremony and the highway's construction situation are detailed below.</p>
<p>Cars and Dust Non-Stop on the Shanghai-Nanxiang Road</p>
<p>On the morning of the 15th, the weather was clear, and many people from all walks of life in Shanghai went to participate in the ceremony. The Shanghai-Wuxi Motor Company provided 60 public buses for pick-up and drop-off at the intersection of the public road. They started running continuously from 7:00 AM. Many people also went to the meeting in their own cars. For a time, cars and dust were non-stop on the Shanghai-Nanxiang Road. The road is paved with gravel. Although the road surface is narrow, it is as smooth as a whetstone. There is no bumpiness on the road. Small bridges along the way are guarded by military police. Passing through Luyang Town, it enters the territory of Jiading County. There are motor vehicle stations with colorful arches on both sides of the road, with banners hanging in the middle, reading "Welcome Chairman Chen and Director Shen to Jia". Before long, the colorful arch of Guyi Garden came into view. It had arrived in Nanxiang and was the location of the ceremony.</p>
<p>More Than One Thousand Guests Attended</p>
<p>Guyi Garden is a famous garden in Nanxiang with pavilions, bridges, mountains, and water, which is quite secluded and beautiful. The auditorium was set up in the hall behind the garden. In the hall, there was a horizontal plaque written by Dong Qichang, "Hua Yan Mo Hai". The hall was full of national flags. The Party and National flags were hung on the stage. In the middle was a portrait of the Founding Father, and the frame "The Revolution Has Not Yet Succeeded, Comrades Must Continue to Strive." On the table on the stage were two pairs of scissors for the ribbon-cutting, engraved with "Presented by Mayor Wu and Director Shen." The ceremony began at 8:30 AM. Attendees included Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Director Shen Baixian, Li Shizeng, Huang Boqiao, Pan Gongzhan, Ye Gongchuo, Zhang Gongquan, Yu Zuoting, Yu Qiaqing, Li Zhaohuan, Du Yuesheng, Lin Kanghou, Liu Zhanen, Wang Yansong, Pan Gengsheng, Mo Heng, Fan Shouzhi, Shen Tianxin, Zheng Yue from the Ministry of Judicial Administration, Zhang Ming, Rong Zongjing, Rong Desheng, Yang Hanxi, Wang Boqi, Xu Shiying, Huang Bodu, Huang Renzhi, Pan Yangyao, Lu Bohong, Wang Manyun, Cheng Shewo, Mao Heyuan, Pan Xulun, Xi Yushu, Xiao Youmei, Liu Haisu, Songhu Garrison Commander Li Duchu, Zhu Tingyu from the Ministry of Navy, Wen Chongxin, Ye Wenzheng from Changshu County Government, Shi Minyong, Cai Degong from the County Party Department, and the Education Bureau, more than one thousand people. The Shanghai Municipal Police Band played music, and a team led by Zhang Shichuan from the Mingxing Film Company, including cinematographer Dong Keyi, arrived at the scene to film along the way.</p>
<p>The Ceremony Began at 8:00 AM</p>

<p>Wu Reported on the Preparations</p>
<p>Chairman Wu Tiecheng reported on the preparation of the Shanghai-Wuxi Road. The Shanghai-Wuxi Highway, together with the Suzhou-Changshu branch road, has been completed. Now that the opening ceremony is being held, I would like to briefly report on the preparation process as follows: The Shanghai-Wuxi Highway and the Suzhou-Changshu branch road are important routes for connecting the inland areas of Jiangsu Province and connecting Shanghai and Wuxi. The areas through which it passes include Jiading, Taicang, Changshu, Wuxi, and Wuxian counties, which are all areas rich in products and densely populated. In the past, the travels between Suzhou, Changshu, Taicang, and Jiading, and between Wuxi and Changshu, all relied on waterways. Often, they were separated by dozens of miles, taking more than a day. Transportation was extremely inconvenient. Therefore, the construction of the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway is extremely important. Chairman Chiang was concerned about highway construction and telegraphed in September of the 22nd year of the Republic of China to prepare for the construction of Tan Road and complete it within a time limit. After receiving the order, I invited leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai to initiate the organization of the Shanghai-Wuxi Road Long-Distance Motor Company and first established a preparatory committee, with Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Gongquan, Chen Guangfu, Qian Xinzhi, Guo Hehui, Yang Hanxi, Qian Sunqing, Sun Zhizhai, Rong Zongjing, and myself as preparatory members, and Wang Xiaolai was elected as the director to prepare for all matters related to the construction of the road and the opening of traffic. However, the Shanghai-Wuxi Road is 140 kilometers long, and the Suzhou-Changshu branch road is 39 kilometers long, totaling 179 kilometers. The route is long, and the funding is huge. After actively raising funds, the provincial and municipal governments and the Shanghai-Wuxi Road Long-Distance Motor Company negotiated the road construction plan and signed a contract, granting the company the exclusive right to operate on the two roads. The entire road project was originally scheduled to be completed in May of the 23rd year of the Republic of China. Later, due to the impact of the sluggish market on the company, it was not easy to raise share capital, which caused the road construction project to be slightly delayed. However, thanks to the efforts of the shareholders of the company, two loans were borrowed to meet the needs of road construction, and the entire road project was completed today. The efforts of the shareholders and the speed of road construction by the provincial government are admirable. The company was officially established at the end of the 23rd year of the Republic of China. Fifteen directors and seven supervisors were elected. Zhang Gongquan was elected as chairman, and Wang Xiaolai and others were elected as standing directors. Wang Xiaolai was hired as the general manager to actively plan the vehicle equipment. After several months of preparation, everything was ready by the end of June of this year. Therefore, the opening ceremony was held today. It is hoped that after the opening of this road, the culture of the various places along the road will progress day by day, and passenger and freight transport will be more convenient. The land transportation between this city and Zhejiang Province, in addition to the railway, already has the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. Now, the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway has been built to connect with the inland areas of Jiangsu Province. In the future, if it can be expanded to complete the highway network of the provinces in the south of the Yangtze River, the prospects are truly unlimited. I am very grateful that the provincial and municipal governments and leaders from all walks of life have come to participate in the meeting. I will briefly report the situation of the preparations to you. I hope that all wise people will give instructions on the road construction and vehicle equipment at any time so as to achieve perfection. It is a great pleasure.</p>
<p>Shen Reported on the Construction Situation</p>
<p>Director Shen reported on the construction process. The Shanghai-Wuxi Road main line starts from Wuxi, passes through Changshu, Taicang, and Jiading counties, and reaches Shanghai, with a total length of about 140 kilometers. The length in Jiangsu is 130 kilometers, which is a major artery connecting the counties south of the Yangtze River to Shanghai. The branch line is from Changshu to Suzhou, with a mileage of 40 kilometers. Construction started in June last year and was completed in July this year. Now, I will report the summary of each project as follows: (1) Roadbed project: The width of the roadbed of the main line is 9 meters. Except for the Taicang section of the Taicang-Jiading section and the Jiading section of the Xiangzhen section, which have been built and only need to be repaired, the excavation and filling of the remaining earthwork is about 900,000 cubic meters. The width of the branch line is 7 meters, and the excavation and filling of the earthwork is about 500,000 cubic meters. (2) Bridge project: In addition to the original 22 bridges, 149 new bridges were built on the main line, with a total length of 2,080 meters. All of them are semi-permanent truss bridges, that is, the lower structure is made of reinforced concrete or stone masonry, and the upper part is made of wooden beams. Forty-five new bridges were built on the branch line, with a total length of 840 meters. (3) Culvert project: In addition to the original 30 culverts, 53 new reinforced concrete pipe culverts or stone masonry square culverts and 313 water pipes were built on the main line. Seventeen new culverts and 282 water pipes were built on the branch line, all in the same style as the main line. (4) Road surface project: The width of the road surface of the main line is temporarily 3 meters, which is a gravel road with a net length of 128 kilometers. When the subgrade is solid and there is a need for traffic, it will be widened and improved. The width of the branch line is 3 meters, which is a mud-bound crushed stone road with a net length of 39 kilometers. (5) Construction cost: The main line costs a total of 1.4 million yuan for new earthwork, bridges, culverts, pipes, and road surfaces. Among them, earthwork accounts for 10%, bridges account for 55%, road surfaces account for 25%, culverts and pipes account for 4%, and others account for 6%. The branch line costs a total of 500,000 yuan for new earthwork, bridges, culverts, and road surfaces. Among them, earthwork accounts for 10%, bridges and culverts account for 60%, road surfaces account for 20%, and others account for 10%. The total cost of the main and branch lines, excluding the original bridges, culverts, earthwork, and land prices, is about 2 million yuan. Among them, the Economic Committee allocated a loan of more than 289,000 yuan for construction costs, the Shanghai-Wuxi Long-Distance Motor Company allocated a loan of 744,000 yuan for construction costs, and paid a franchise driving security deposit of 68,000 yuan. The remaining amount was all allocated by Jiangsu Province. Thanks to the guidance and assistance of all parties and the joint efforts of the construction personnel, it was completed in one year. I am very grateful.</p>
<p>Wang Reported on the Company's Status</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, director of the Shanghai-Wuxi Company, reported that in order to save time, I will report on behalf of the company. Thank you all for coming from afar. The weather is very good today. It can be said that we have the right time, the right place, and the right people. The Yangtze River is to the north of this road, and the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway is to the south. The road is also very prosperous along the way. The road is jointly run by the government and the people, and everything can be done with sincerity and openness, resulting in good results. The motor company is a transportation agency. Domestic transportation is inconvenient. I hope that it can gradually develop to promote the development of culture and economy. Our company is commercial in nature, but we strive to reduce the car prices to serve the public. I hope that all sectors will give instructions to improve and achieve perfection.</p>
<p>Chen Qicai and Yu Zuoting Gave Speeches</p>
<p>Chen Qicai said briefly that I am very honored to participate in this grand meeting. After listening to the reports of Mayor Wu, Director Shen, and Mr. Wang, I deeply know its benefits and the difficulty of construction. Therefore, we should find ways to maintain it and work together to develop it on the one hand and maintain it on the other hand. I came by public bus, and there are many automotive professionals in the same car. In order to prevent the machine from changing, the driving should be slower. Yu Zuoting, chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, said that I am very honored to participate in this grand ceremony. Developing highways is strengthening national defense.</p>
<p>Mayor and Director Performed the Ribbon-cutting Ceremony</p>
<p>After the ceremony, the guests dispersed in the sound of military music and went to the ribbon-cutting ceremony near Guyi Garden on the Shanghai-Wuxi Road. The company had previously built a decorated archway with colorful ribbons. At around 9:00 AM, Mayor Wu Tiecheng and Director Shen Baixian performed the ribbon-cutting ceremony. After the ribbon-cutting, the cars drove westward to Changshu in an orderly manner.</p>
<p>Vehicles Drove to Changshu in an Orderly Manner</p>
<p>At 9:30 AM, after the ceremony, Shen and his wife and son took their own car first, followed by Mayor Wu and Wang Xiaolai, and finally the buses prepared by the company, which successively departed from Xiang. Passing through the two major counties of Jiading and Taicang, the ancient city loomed in the greenery, which was quite picturesque. The villagers in the towns of Malu, Shuangfeng, and Zhitang all stood on the banks of the fields to welcome the passing guests. From Xiang to Qin, it is 77 kilometers. The journey took more than two hours. There are many rivers and ponds along the way, so there are many bridges. The cars could not travel too fast. Fortunately, the road surface is flat and there are few twists and turns, so the journey is not bumpy.</p>
<p>Lunch and Sightseeing of Famous Scenic Spots</p>
<p>Arriving at the Shanghai-Wuxi Road, Changshu, it is a crossroads, with Wuxi to the west, Shanghai to the east, Suzhou to the south, and Changshu to the north. All guests got off the cars at the station. A temporary decorated archway was built there, with the words "Changshu County Government, County Party Department, and Various Organizations Welcome the Guests Participating in the Opening Ceremony" written on it. The number of Changshu people watching the excitement was no less than tens of thousands, which was rare in the past. All guests walked to the reception office on Nanjie Front Street for lunch. The hall of the Dadong Hotel was the reception office for foreign guests, the second floor was the rest area for female guests, and the second floor of the Deyi Building was the reception office. The upstairs of the Changle Tea Garden was the rest area for drivers and guards, and the second and third floors were the reception office. The second floor of the Greater China Tea House was the reception office for male guests. Lunch was all Changshu famous dishes from Shanjing Garden. After lunch, the guests visited Yushan Mountain. At the entrance of the mountain, the four big characters "Yushan Blessed Land" were written. (1) Yaji Pavilion: Located at the foot of the mountain west of the city, overlooking it, you can have a panoramic view of the scenery of the city. (2) Sword Gate: In front of the Fushui Temple, the mountain stone cliff is cracked like being split, with a cliff of more than ten feet, making people dare not look up.

<h3>Representatives of the First Special District Rent Reduction Association Petition Today, Requesting the Prompt Promulgation of Rent Reduction Regulations</h3>

<h3>Dredging Bureau Requests Approval to Exempt Export Goods from Dredging Tax, Reduce the Burden on Merchants and Promote the Export of Local Goods; the Ministry Has Approved a Trial Period of One Year</h3>
<p>Since Mr. Song Ziliang took office as the chief director of the Shanghai Dredging Bureau, he has spared no effort to develop port affairs and benefit merchants. Director Song believes that domestic commerce is declining and finance is exhausted. It is not enough to reverse the dangerous situation without finding ways to reduce the burden on merchants and encourage the increase in exports. Therefore, he requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance to approve the exemption of all dredging taxes levied on tax-free export goods and re-exported goods from Shanghai for a trial period of one year to see the effect. It is learned that the Bureau has received the joint order from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating, "We have received the report that the request to exempt dredging donations on tax-free export goods and re-exported goods is to reduce the burden on merchants and encourage the export of local goods, which is feasible. It should be approved for a trial period, which will be implemented from August 1st. In addition to ordering the (Ministry of Finance) to instruct the customs to comply with the regulations, you should immediately comply with the regulations." It is also heard that this move by the Bureau will result in a significant loss in its regular revenue each year, but it is still willing to consider the difficulties of merchants, which is admirable.</p>
<h3>Hydrographic Office Proclamation: There Are Submerged Reefs at the Mouth of the Xijiang River; Navigating Circles Must Pay Attention</h3>
<p>The customs patrol ship Chaxing recently patrolled the coastal ports and discovered submerged reefs in the northwest of Dalanggang at the mouth of the Xijiang River, namely at 113 degrees 18 minutes east longitude and 21 degrees 59 minutes north latitude, 315 degrees from the top of Dalanggang Mountain, at a distance of about four chains. The reefs are already two feet above the water surface, which poses a significant hazard to navigation. It has been reported to the Hydrographic Office of the Ministry of the Navy to be included in the nautical chart, with dangerous lines and annotations such as "Two Feet Dry" and "Approximate Location" to alert the navigating circles to avoid misjudgment and accidents. The Hydrographic Office has issued Proclamation No. 136 to notify all shipping companies to inform their crew members to check and take note.</p>
<h3>Continued Efforts in the Foreign Settlement to Prevent Cholera</h3>
<p>According to a recent report submitted to the board of directors by the Public Works Department's health division, the sanitation conditions within the settlement were highly satisfactory until the end of June this year. However, with the sudden arrival of extreme heat in mid-July, a slight deterioration was observed, leading to instances of heatstroke, sudden collapses, and the occurrence of contagious gastrointestinal diseases, resulting in a number of fatalities. Nonetheless, the most notable feature of this year is the complete absence of cholera cases. Although there were reports of cholera cases in the newspapers last month, these were based on irresponsible rumors. Furthermore, the organizational structure of the agencies currently investigating cholera outbreaks is extremely thorough. Upon conducting on-site inspections, it can be immediately proven that these rumors are entirely unfounded. Regarding the measures taken by the health authorities in the foreign settlement to prevent cholera, they have adopted two approaches: one focusing on individuals and the other on drinking water. In terms of individual measures, over 49,000 people have already received preventative vaccinations this summer, not including the more than 2,200 individuals who received a second dose. As for drinking water, approximately 15,000 gallons of clean drinking water are supplied daily by the waterworks company to areas where clean water is lacking. In addition, the 972 drinking wells in the suburbs are disinfected on average every six days. Furthermore, strict attention is paid to street vendors selling cut fruit and iced drinks. Those who sell ice cream and fruit juices on the streets and markets without a license are subject to crackdown. People transporting ice cream are also required to wear badges to prevent impersonation. Several hundred bottles of privately made, uninspected fruit juice have also been seized and confiscated. Furthermore, the flytraps used by various beverage manufacturers last month have been highly effective and the health department has directed various food establishments and vegetable markets to adopt them extensively.</p>
<h3>Central Mint Yesterday Begins Minting New Coins Old Coin Models Already Stored</h3>

<h3>Loan Committee Actively Reviews Applications More Than Sixty Companies Apply For Loans Many Applicants Still Unclear About Procedures Not Only Do They Not Meet Regulations, but They Are Also Impossible to Review</h3>
<p>Since the initiation of industrial and commercial credit loans in this city, some individuals have remained unclear about the true situation. Yesterday, our reporter specifically interviewed the person in charge of the loan review committee. According to him, the committee serves as an intermediary between the Ministry of Finance, the lending banks, and the borrowers. It hopes that all parties will cooperate sincerely to ensure smooth progress. If there are obstacles in the implementation of the loans, the committee will promptly propose to the Ministry of Finance methods to adapt to the environment. For example, the committee proposed to the Ministry of Finance to reduce the number of guarantors for credit loans from two shops to one, and to approve the dough industry association's method of joint and several guarantee. Lately, for the sake of the applicants, the committee is working with representatives of various banks to study the loan procedures, striving to make special accommodations within the realm of possibility. On the applicant side, the committee is also providing sincere guidance and has entrusted the accounting firm of Lisin to provide free guidance. However, most of the borrowers are small industrialists and businessmen, and their completed forms show that they have not previously had dealings with banks and money houses. They have little experience with business practices. This request for loans from the committee is like their first dealings with banks and money houses. Therefore, even with guidance, there are still many procedural errors, which not only fail to meet regulations but are also impossible to review. Although the committee is entrusted by the government to review loans, and has the nature of rescuing industry and commerce, it is not comparable to disaster relief. It cannot disregard regulations and make arbitrary loans in pursuit of the beautiful name of bestowing generosity and helping the masses. Currently, more than sixty companies have applied to the committee, and they are actively being investigated and reviewed. The committee will submit them to a meeting within days to decide on lending. However, the committee has entrusted the municipal chamber of commerce to issue more than four thousand blank application forms. There are many who have received the forms but have not yet applied. The reasons are nothing more than the following: (1) the Mid-Autumn Festival is not yet approaching, (2) difficulty in finding guarantors, (3) most lack business knowledge and are unclear about filling out the forms, (4) waiting and seeing. In addition to points (1) and (4), which are matters of time, there are remedies for points (2) and (3), as mentioned above. Therefore, the committee is always doing its best to achieve the goals of rescuing industry and commerce and stabilizing the market. It also hopes that those responsible for public opinion will clearly understand the committee's regulations and actual work situation, and provide reasonable supervision. If there are reasonable opinions, it is hoped that they will be contributed as much as possible so that the committee can forward them to the Ministry of Finance for adoption and implementation. Do not merely take passages out of context and make irrelevant criticisms, so as not to hinder the spirit of cooperation among all parties. In particular, it is hoped that assistance will be provided to guide borrowers who lack knowledge, as this is the most important point. It is like a doctor prescribing medicine, but if the patient does not know how to take it according to the prescription, it will ultimately be useless, and the responsibility is not entirely on the doctor. The letter from the committee to the municipal chamber of commerce regarding joint and several guarantees is extracted as follows: To: Municipal Chamber of Commerce Regarding your letter Shangzi No. 563, which stated that the Dough Industry Association requested that each member shop be given a loan according to the size of its capital, divided into several levels of one hundred yuan, fifty yuan, and thirty yuan, and that three shops would provide joint and several guarantees, and that the association would affix its seal to show credit, etc., requesting that the committee consider making changes to the regulations. Approved. The case has been resolved by the seventh meeting of the committee: "The requested small loans should be approved for modification to be guaranteed jointly and severally by three companies. Each industry association may also follow the example. After requesting instructions from the Ministry of Finance and obtaining approval, they will be approved for release." The minutes are on file. In addition to requesting instructions from the Ministry of Finance, a corresponding letter is hereby sent in reply. Please check and inform accordingly.</p>

<h3>Autumn Property Tax Self-Payment Period Expires</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Finance Bureau began collecting autumn property tax on August 1, those who paid on their own initiative and those who sent bank checks by mail have been very active.

The disaster children brought with them are all naked and the weather is turning cool, making it difficult for them to endure. "Do you have any clothes of this kind? If not, please collect them from outside. Whether single, lined, or cotton, any amount is welcome for distribution. This is also a meritorious deed."

<p>Huayang Yizhenhui has again received telegrams from disaster areas in Anhui and Shandong, which are recorded separately below: (1) A telegram from the Anhui Tongling County Government Party Department, Chamber of Commerce, and various bureaus states, "The people of Tongling have been struck by disaster and are suffering from floods again. This summer, the upper reaches of the Yangtze River have flooded, and all counties along the river in Anhui Province have suffered. Tongling County has the reputation of having three mountains and seven embankments. All large and small levees in the county are densely packed. For a month, they have been protected day and night. Unfortunately, the water level has increased day by day, and with the invasion of strong winds, more than 50 large and small embankments have collapsed, totaling over 90,000 mu of inundated farmland, with an estimated loss of over 800,000 yuan in agricultural products, more than 8,000 households of disaster victims, totaling more than 40,000 people, and 5,000 flooded houses, not to mention livestock and farming tools. In the past, when the Weixiang area was hit by a disaster, it could still seek food in the mountain areas. However, the mountain areas have not recovered from last year's severe drought and are unable to care for themselves. Now, the disaster victims are scattered and displaced, eating in the wind and sleeping in the open, crying out in a miserable way. As autumn approaches, we feel even more sorrow and pity. We are urgently seeking relief and jointly request that you allocate and distribute emergency relief to save the dying people." (2) A letter from the Shandong Yuncheng County Party Affairs Consolidation Committee states, "The people of Shanxi are unfortunate. For several years, disasters have been frequent, people's livelihoods have been exhausted, and the rural economy has collapsed. On July 10 of this year, the Yellow River burst its banks in Chenglingpu, and the rolling torrents directly flooded Yuncheng. Despite desperate efforts to block the breach, the water was too great to defend. The villages and fields that were flooded, houses were ruined, and miscellaneous supplies and food were all washed away. From the southern border of Shanxi to the northeastern border, a length of over 100 li and a width of 50-60 li, the water depth is 7-8 chi or 6-9 chi, a vast expanse of water, completely becoming a swamp. Of the nine districts in the county, eight have been affected. The number of villages affected is over 840, the number of disaster victims is over 300,000, and the loss of houses, equipment, food, etc. totals over 3 million yuan. The number of people and livestock who have died is still unknown. This is truly an unprecedented disaster for the people of Shanxi. All the flood victims are without food and clothing, and their cries are miserable to hear. The bodies of people and livestock are still being washed down the river from time to time. There are even bodies tied together in bundles of seven, eight, or even more than ten people. The sight is too terrible to see. The dead are gone, but what do the living rely on? The situation is dangerous, and relief is especially urgent. Please quickly allocate large sums to help the dying disaster victims."</p>

<h3>Prediction by the Whangpoo Conservancy Board The Greatest High Tide This Morning Predicted to Exceed Twelve Feet and Still Rising</h3>
<p>The high tide in the Whangpoo River at 0:40 yesterday morning also exceeded the amount predicted by the Whangpoo Conservancy Board, measuring 12 feet 3 inches (the prediction was 11 feet 9 inches). This high tide began to rise at 9:35 the night before last and did not completely recede until about 12:00 noon yesterday. According to the bureau's prediction, the highest tide of this month will occur at 1:20 this morning, measuring 12 feet 2 inches. However, based on the actual amounts recorded in the past two days, both have exceeded the predicted amounts, so the momentum will inevitably continue to increase. It is very close to the height of the 13-foot seawall at Outer Huangpu, which is worthy of attention. The following is a detailed list of the tide times: The high tide this morning began to rise at 11:40 last night. At 0:45 this morning, the rising trend was the most rapid, with a water flow rate of 2.2 nautical miles per hour. At 1:20, it reached its highest point, measuring 12 feet 2 inches (due to weather conditions, it will actually exceed this amount). It is expected to completely recede around noon today.</p>
<h3>German Second Express Ship The Potsdam Arrives Today Enters Port at Twelve O'Clock Docks at Kung Ho Hsiang</h3>

<h3>After the Settlement of the Great China Case Criminal Cases Separately Ended Yan Qishan and Others Not Guilty</h3>
<p>There were four or five lawsuits arising from the fire at the Great China Celluloid Manufacturing Factory and the disaster victims. Later, the entire dispute was resolved peacefully out of court, so these lawsuits were also settled, except for those whose self-accusations could not be withdrawn according to law. As for the cases whose self-accusations could not be withdrawn, they have been separately tried and sentenced by the First Special District Local Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Jiang also ruled in a case in which the defendants were the disaster victims Yan Qishan, Qin Bukun, Liu Jinbiao, Zhang Yucheng, Zhu Wei, Chen Yao, etc. They were self-accused by the factory manager Jiang Junyan of forcibly carrying coffins into the factory and destroying objects in the factory. Because the clauses of the accusation could not be withdrawn, Judge Jiang opened the trial some days ago, and now he has ruled that all the defendants are not guilty. This was originally the last case to be concluded by the factory.

<h3>Wei Tingrong's Eldest Son Will Surrender to the Court Embezzlement of Treasury Bond Case Opens This Morning</h3>
<p>Wei Yuansheng, the eldest son of Wei Tingrong, the current commander of the French Concession Volunteer Corps, used the name of Wei Yuanji to enter and exit the stock market. He initially became acquainted with Gan Denglai, a clerk at the Jinyu Stock Exchange in Qingyuanli, Beijing Road. They had cooperated in the buying and selling of various stocks, but Gan lost more than 10,000 yuan and was unable to make it up. On the 29th of last month, he took the opportunity to steal a huge amount of customs treasury bonds from Jinyu and hid at Wei Yuansheng's house at 994 Xujiahui Road. Later, Gan was arrested, and Yuansheng used the excuse of going to Hangzhou to disappear without a trace. The First Special District Local Court has issued a warrant for his arrest. It is now heard that Wei Tingrong, because his son Yuansheng has been named for arrest by the court, must appear in court no matter what. Therefore, he has decided to order Yuansheng to surrender himself as soon as possible to avoid delaying the case indefinitely. This morning is the date for the continued trial of the case. In addition to the detention of Gan Denglai, who will be escorted to court by the police, Wei Yuansheng also intends to surrender himself without waiting for arrest and face trial jointly with Gan. He has also hired a lawyer to defend him.</p>
<h3>Bank of China Employee Embezzles Huge Sum – Foolishly Takes 26,000 Yuan – Sentenced to Three Years in Prison After Interrogation</h3>
<p>Chen Jixian, an employee of the payment department of the Hongkou branch of the Bank of China at 894 North Sichuan Road, was a native of Tongxiang, Zhejiang Province. On the afternoon of the 5th of this month, at 5:30 PM, he embezzled 26,000 yuan in silver notes and fled. The incident was reported to various police stations, and a reward was offered in newspapers for his arrest. However, there was no trace of him. It wasn't until 11 AM the day before yesterday that Wang Zhenfang, the manager of the branch, learned that Chen was hiding in the Shanghai Sanitarium at 150 Robber's Road, Hongkou. Wang then reported it to the Hongkou police station, which dispatched Chinese Detective Wang Chonghao and Western Detective with warrant No. 167 from Court No. 1, and secretly went to the hospital. They arrested him in room 26. The stolen money was found hidden in a small leather suitcase in the bathroom. Upon opening the door to the bathroom and inspecting the suitcase, they found 25,750 yuan of the original stolen money, leaving 250 yuan missing. Chen claimed that he gave 200 yuan to the hospital for fees and spent 50 yuan himself. Four keys and two seals were also found on his person and were taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Court. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, recounted the previous events, stating that the defendant had been working at the head office for four years. In March of this year, he was assigned to the Hongkou branch as a payment clerk. That evening, a shop owner named Wang Ruitang saw him lingering in the restroom for ten minutes before leaving with a hat box. The next day, the defendant sent a letter declaring his resignation. Now, according to Article 232, Section 2 of the Criminal Law, the crime of embezzlement in business is brought to public prosecution, and a severe sentence is requested. The evidence was presented for inspection. Wang Zhenfang, the head of the branch, also provided evidence. When questioned, the defendant confessed that unfortunately, something happened at home in his hometown, and he was burdened with many debts, which led his parents and wife into great difficulty. This caused him to suffer a nervous breakdown, leading him to resort to such a desperate measure, and he begged for leniency. Judge Xiao Xieffen sentenced Chen Jixian to three years in prison and a fine of 500 yuan. If the fine is commuted to labor service, it would be calculated at three yuan per day. The keys were confiscated, and the stolen money was returned to the original owner.</p>

<h3>Zhabei Datong Road: Robbers Snatch Policeman's Handgun – Three Robbers Act Together – One Suspect Apprehended</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 4:50 AM, Zhao Yueyun, a police officer from the Taiyang Temple Police Station in Zhabei, was on duty at post number 38 at the railway crossing on Datong Road when he was suddenly attacked by three robbers. One robber grabbed Zhao around the waist from behind, while the other two pointed a handgun at the officer's chest, ordering him not to make a sound or move. One of the robbers then snatched the officer's handgun. Although Officer Zhao wanted to resist, he was outnumbered and helpless. After the incident, the robbers fled eastward towards Jingjiang Road. The officer followed the robbers but lost them at a side street of Jingjiang Road and returned to report to Inspector Zhang Zhongde. After receiving the report, Inspector Zhang immediately dispatched Police Chief Hu Lianbo, Zhu Liming, and Yang Jintang, leading several officers to pursue and search. However, the robbers were nowhere to be found. The officers returned to the station, and after Inspector Zhang questioned Officer Zhao, he found that the robbers had left behind a handgun case, a handgun belt, and a straw hat while robbing the officer. These items, along with Officer Zhao Yueyun, were sent to the Xinzha branch under the escort of Police Chief Hu. Upon receiving the report, Director Ruan of the branch immediately ordered Officer Ouyang Liu to interrogate Zhao Yueyun. Zhao Yueyun, age 28, from Hunan, gave a similar account. After reviewing the statements, Officer Ouyang and Director Ruan discussed the matter. Considering that the case involved robbers snatching a handgun from a police officer, they ordered subordinates to intensify the search for the robbers and bring them to justice. At the same time, Zhao Yueyun and the recovered items were sent to the main bureau for further investigation. It was also reported that the detective squad apprehended a suspect yesterday afternoon and is currently investigating the case.</p>

<h3>Pushi Road: Counterfeit Silver Manufacturing Den Broken Up – Various Smelting Implements Arranged Neatly – Fourteen Workers and Shop Employees Detained</h3>
<p>Jiang Futian, a detective inspector from the French Police, received a tip-off the day before yesterday, stating that at No. 117 Pushi Road (near the Sacred Heart Hospital), people were collecting double yuan silver coins and old items to melt and mix with lead to create silver bars and ingots for resale to small banks for profit, or so it was said, to be sold abroad. Inspector Jiang considered that damaging national currency violated the law. Based on the information, he reported it to the Western Detective Chief. On the morning of the 14th, at 3:00 AM, accompanied by Western Detective Chief Guli (transliteration), Liang Mu Wang Rusong, Zhang Daorong, Detectives Liu Jinrong, Guo Shaorong, Wang Dongwan, and other Chinese and Vietnamese police officers, they drove in police vehicles to No. 117 Pushi Road, the location of the operation. They first surrounded the building and then knocked on the door to enter. They found that the upper floors were all workshops, with various smelting and manufacturing implements arranged neatly. They arrested Ji Heshang from Shaoxing, Xie Laichao, Zhao Aquan, Zhou Shichao, Yu Qijin from Nantong, Yang Renchuan, Li Heshang, Zhou Guoan, Li Miaofa, Han Akang from the local area, Han Asheng, Wang Qingzhang from Ningbo, Liu A'er from Chongming, Chen Jianchu from Liuhou, Taicang, and 14 other people. These individuals were divided into workers responsible for melting, manufacturing, and other tasks, as well as tea servers, shop employees, and cooks. They confiscated 88 round silver lead blocks, 5 silver bricks, 12 lead bricks, as well as finished and unfinished blanks, and various equipment used for melting, with an estimated value of 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. They took all the witnesses and evidence back to the police station for investigation. They also dispatched detectives to guard the operation and arrest any remaining accomplices. After strict interrogation at the police station, the suspects confessed that the mastermind of the operation was Li Guoliang, a 26-year-old from Nantong, who lived at No. 364 Yongxing Road, Zhabei, and worked as the accountant in the Yichang Foundry. The front was run by Qi Runcai (age 33), the owner of the Wanshengxiang cigarette paper shop at No. 72 Huaxing Road, Zhabei, from Changshu. The French police immediately dispatched the original team of detectives to the Zhabei Public Security Bureau to request assistance in apprehending Li and Ni. The two suspects were arrested, and many privately manufactured silver bars were confiscated from their homes. They were taken to the Public Security Main Bureau for temporary detention. Yesterday, due to the Catholic Feast of the Assumption, the French Police Department was closed for the holiday and did not work, so they could not be sent to court. The 14 suspects arrested on Pushi Road will be sent to the Second Special Court this morning for questioning. At the same time, they will request the court to prepare a document to transfer Li and Ni from the Public Security Bureau to their custody for questioning. On Binlang Road, four robbers from Jiangbei, Cao Youxian, Yin Zixiang, Li Wangshi, and Liu Beipei, were arrested. Two handguns and 19 bullets were confiscated and taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special Court with a request for detention pending investigation. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the police station, rose and detailed the circumstances of the case, stating that on the morning of the 13th of this month, at 12:15 AM, Chinese Detective Inspector Qi Mengqing received a tip-off that a gang of thieves was hiding at No. 5 Junyi Lane, Binlang Road in the Chinese area, intending to rob the wealth of the St. Anna Dance Hall opposite the Zhaofeng Garden in West Shanghai that night. He, along with police detectives from the Sixth District Public Security Bureau, went to the address. Upon entering the room, they found Cao and Yin sleeping in the same bed and arrested them. They confiscated two handguns, 19 bullets, and two magazines from under the pillow, along with the woman Li Wangshi, and took them to the Public Security Bureau. Shortly after, Liu Depei arrived at the house and was apprehended by the Public Security Bureau officers guarding the house and transferred to the police station. When questioned about the source of the handguns, Cao Youxian confessed that the guns and bullets belonged to Sun Daerzi, who lived in Huazibang, Zhabei. The detectives went to arrest Sun, but he had already fled. They only confiscated a string of fake pearls. Then, based on Cao's confession, they arrested an accomplice named Wang in a bungalow on Guangfu Road, but he had also escaped. They confiscated a pawn ticket and retrieved a watch from a pawnshop. After investigation, they learned that the fake pearls and watch were the original stolen goods from the Zhao family at No. 25, Lane 49, Zhoujia Bridge Road, robbed at 8:00 AM on June 23rd of this year. The two confiscated handguns had also been sent to the Public Works Department for inspection. One of the handguns, No. [illegible], was found to be related to the robbery of a resident at No. 10 Dongjiatan, Yinxiang Port, at 2:00 AM on December 9th of last year, and the robbery and attempted murder of a resident at No. 143 Tangshan Road at 3:00 AM on April 3rd of this year. Since the investigation of this case is not yet complete, he requested permission to detain the suspects. It was also found that Cao Youxian, Yin Zixiang, and Liu Depei had all been convicted of theft. Cao was sentenced to 15 years in prison in the Chinese area, Yin was sentenced to 10 years in this court, and Liu was sentenced to 5 years in the French Concession. All three were repeat offenders. The four suspects all denied the charges. Judge Wu Zehan reviewed the confessions and approved the detention of the four defendants for seven days pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Five Murder Cases Occur in Nanshi, Zhabei, and West Shanghai</h3>
<p>Five murder cases occurred in Nanshi, Zhabei, West Shanghai, and other areas of the city in the past two days. The police stations have assigned local heads to report to the local court for corpse examination. The details of each case are listed below:</p>
<p>Died from Vomiting Blood: Wen Yuhong from Yangzhou, age 53, residing at No. 16 Yuelai Street, Xiaodongmen, Yuchangshou's residence, had been unemployed for a long time. Unexpectedly, at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, he suddenly vomited blood profusely on the way on Yuelai Street. His complexion changed rapidly, and he collapsed to the ground, barely breathing. When the police from Post No. 19 of the 16th Sub-bureau of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Fang Yulong, discovered the situation and rushed to investigate, he had already died. The incident was reported to Director Huang Junfu, who submitted a report to the General Bureau for filing. The local head was instructed to report to the court for a corpse examination. The deceased had no family members, only a friend named Luo Chunshan, who lives at the Garbage Bridge in the Public Concession.</p>
<p>Died in a Car from Illness: Ye Xianmei from Taizhou, Zhejiang, age 38, residing at No. 30 Wujiazhai, Jisi Feier Road, West Shanghai, made socks for a living. Ye had recently been ill and had no money for treatment. After borrowing a few yuan, he took a rickshaw to seek medical treatment at around 8:00 AM yesterday morning. Unexpectedly, when the rickshaw arrived at the entrance of the alley, Ye suddenly deteriorated and died inside the rickshaw. The police officer from the Caojiadu Public Security Bureau in West Shanghai noticed the situation and reported it to Inspector Long, who reported it to Sub-bureau Director Tan Baoshou. A report was submitted to the General Bureau for filing. The local head was instructed to report to the court for a corpse examination.</p>
<p>Hanging Himself Over a Dispute: Li Gendao, a local, age 36, lived in Guchazhai No. 14, Pengpei Town, and made a living by farming. At around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, he had a dispute with his elder brother, Li Rongfeng, who lived next door, over the problem of a thatched shed. After Gendao was reprimanded by Rongfeng, he turned and went home, harboring resentment and a desire to end his life. Late at night, he sneaked to the doorway of Li Rongfeng's house and hanged himself. A neighbor discovered the body and reported it to the Pupu Outpost of the Xinzha Sub-bureau of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, who reported it to the General Bureau for filing. The local head was instructed to report to the local court for a corpse examination.</p>
<p>Suicide Due to Quarrel: Zhu, who resided at No. 8 Youche Lane, Youche Wharf, Nanshi, married a woman surnamed Wang from Zhenhai, Zhejiang, last year (namely, Zhu Wangshi, age 19). After the marriage, the relationship between the couple was harmonious. Unexpectedly, the woman became upset with her husband over a minor matter the night before last, and secretly hanged herself. Her elder brother, Wang Rongding, discovered the body and tried to save her, but it was too late. He reported the incident to Dongjiadu Police Station Chief Yi Zuanshi, who sent Inspector Chen to investigate and reported the incident to the General Bureau.</p>
<p>Suicide Due to Stupidity: Jiang Jinhai (age 26, from Tongzhou), a colleague of Zhu Shengshi, who ran the Zhu Shunxing Copper Workshop at No. 17 Minzhu Street, Lao Beimen, was recently studying at the literacy school at No. 33 Lane, Houjia Road. However, Jiang Jinhai had a poor memory and found it difficult to write down the new characters taught each day. If he was asked to recite them, he would stare blankly and be unable to answer. Therefore, he felt sorry for himself. The night before last, while his colleagues were asleep, he hanged himself with lead wire on the mezzanine. It was not until about 5:00 AM yesterday morning that a colleague noticed the body and was shocked. He tried to untie the rope, but the body was already cold as ice. He reported it to the police station, instructing the ninth-district head, Jiang Pingyang, to report to the local court for an examination. It was also stated that Professor Wang Baoliang from the school had said that the deceased had not attended classes for several days. After receiving the report, the court immediately appointed Prosecutor Ouyang Shu and Examiner Xuan Zhiming to conduct an on-site examination and confirm the death.</p>
<h3>Brother Stabs Sister-in-Law to Death: A Bizarre Case of Family Misfortune</h3>
<p>Yue Zihong, age 21, who worked as a peddler, was from Shanghai. His elder brother, Zicheng, age 38, also worked as a peddler. The two brothers lived together at No. 12 Jukui South Lane, Jukui Street, Xiaodongmen. The brothers got along well on weekdays. They set up a stall at the street entrance, selling toys, and their lives were not bad. In December of last year, Zihong married a woman surnamed Shen (17 years old this year) from Changzhou with the help of a matchmaker. The couple's relationship was harmonious. Unexpectedly, Ms. Shen suddenly ran away from home without her husband's knowledge in April of this year. The Caojiadu Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested her and transferred her to the Shanghai Local Court for trial. Her husband, Yue Zihong, was then summoned to take custody of her. After Yue Zihong brought Ms. Shen back home, she suddenly said that her brother-in-law, Zicheng, had repeatedly flirted with her, and she ran away because she couldn't stand it. At around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, Zihong went out to sell toys. However, his elder brother, Zicheng, was sick at home. Unexpectedly, at around 9:00 AM, Zicheng suddenly jumped out of bed, took a triangular, sharp knife about eight inches long, and ran into Ms. Shen's room. He suddenly stabbed Ms. Yue Pan's left chest below the breast, about several inches deep. Ms. Pan screamed in pain and fell to the ground, blood gushing out like a spring. Zicheng's anger did not subside. He stabbed Ms. Pan's lower body three or four more times. Realizing that he had committed a serious crime, he hurriedly ran down the stairs. At this time, the second landlord of the house, Ms. Gao, suddenly heard a desperate cry for help from the Yue's room upstairs. Knowing that something was wrong, she immediately went upstairs to investigate and met Yue Zicheng. She only saw him rushing downstairs and did not know what had happened. When Ms. Gao went upstairs and saw Ms. Pan lying in a pool of blood, unable to speak, she was shocked. She immediately called the neighbors in the house to help chase after Zicheng. At that time, Zicheng had already fled out the door and disappeared. She immediately called Ms. Pan's husband, Yue Zihong, to report the incident to the Chenghuang Temple Police Station, who immediately dispatched an inspector to investigate. Ms. Pan had already died. A bloodstained murder weapon was found in the room and taken back to the station. The incident was reported to Director Liu of the police station. Considering that the case involved human life and the circumstances were bizarre, he instructed the local head to report to the local court and send someone to conduct an on-site examination. He also ordered the police to pay attention and investigate the suspect in the case and bring him to justice. After this case occurred, it spread far and wide, so many people went to watch, and Jukui Street was very crowded.</p>

At 12:05 PM, they hired a No. 1515 rowboat to cross the river. When they arrived at the Wuma Road dock in Puxi, the boatwoman Zhang Shi used her hand to pull the pier's outer fender. The people got ashore one after another, and the last apprentice, Xia Pengnian, was about to follow when Shi suddenly loosened her hands and the rowboat moved straight outward. Xia lost his footing and fell into the river on the spot. Although the people on the shore threw life buoys, it was impossible to save him, and Xia was submerged and disappeared. The partners reported to the Customs Water Police Station, who sent detectives to take the two women Zhang Shi and Yang Ma to the police station and asked them why they had fled and failed to rescue him. However, the two women suddenly pointed out that the deceased had jumped into the river to commit suicide. Considering that the case involved human life, they were instructed to wait for the court to investigate this morning. It is reported that the deceased was 16 years old, from Shaoxing, and was the only son. His family only had a mother, which is extremely tragic.</p>

<p>Hu Die Hosts Aviation Variety Show Tomorrow: Plot Summary of "Wife of the Republic of China"</p>
<p>Film star Ms. Hu Die has attracted much attention since returning from overseas. The Aviation Association, in order to expand the promotion of aviation and raise donations, specially sent Zhang Yuliang to contact her to hold an aviation variety show. Zhang Shichuan, the general manager of Star Film Company, expressed his strong support for this initiative. It was decided that Ms. Hu Die would lead the company's actors and actresses in a patriotic comedy, "Wife of the Republic of China". In addition to Hu Die, there are also Gao Qianping, Ye Qiuxin, Zhu Qiuhen, Wang Huijuan, Xu Lai, Yan Yuexian, Xuan Jinglin, Gu Lanjun, Huang Naishuang, Shu Xiuwen, Yuan Shaomei, and others. The plot is very relevant and contains the meaning of saving the country through aviation. Zhang Shichuan has been personally directing the play for several days, and it has been decided that it will be shown on the screen at the Lafai Garden tomorrow, so that the citizens of Shanghai can enjoy a feast for the eyes. It is reported that before the performance, there will be various novel song and dance performances, creating an unprecedented grand occasion. In order to facilitate the convenience of the audience, on the 17th and 18th, Yunfei and Xiangsheng automobile companies will provide free transportation. The crowds of spectators at that time will be beyond imagination. However, there are not many tickets, so purchase them as soon as possible. Ticket sales locations: Wing On, Sincere, New World, China National Goods, Fu An, Guanshengyuan, Ma Baoshan and other companies, International Hotel, National Goods Market, Baxianqiao YMCA Aviation Association, Renji Road Huwei Company, Fenglin Bridge Star Company. It is reported that each ticket costs two yuan. The plot summary of "Wife of the Republic of China" is listed below: Ling Ayun (played by Hu Die) is a female worker. She originally had a lover, Hu Xiangsheng (played by Gao Zhanfei), and they were engaged to be married. However, her mother (played by Shu Xiuwen) was unwilling to marry her to Xiangsheng because he had no money. But she did not think that her mother should interfere in her life's affairs. Ayun used the money she earned from her work, in addition to supporting the family, to buy an aviation lottery ticket, which won the first prize. The newspaper reporter (played by Gong Jianong Mei Xi) naturally came to visit immediately, and Xiangsheng was also very happy for her. People who used to dislike her for being poor and unwilling to marry her all came to propose marriage. However, although she won the first prize, she did not enjoy it herself, but donated it all to the government to buy two airplanes. Therefore, she said to herself, "I am still a poor person." But no one would believe her. Four self-proclaimed extraordinary people (Wang Xianzhai, Wang Jiting, You Guangzhao, Xie Yunqing) came to propose to Ayun. Ayun felt that such a thing was simply impossible to deal with, so she took advantage of this situation and issued another three million lottery tickets. All the ticket money was donated to the government to buy twenty airplanes. Whoever wins the first prize, she will marry. Then all the people who proposed to her went to buy lottery tickets, not only to win the prize, but also to marry Ayun. When Xiangsheng learned about this method, he was naturally a little sad, but after Ayun explained it to him, he understood that Ayun was marrying the country for the sake of righteousness, so how could he bear to take this "Wife of the Republic of China" as his own?</p>

<h3>Our Nation's Cinnamon: Can Be Used to Produce High-Quality Essences - Recent Invention by a French Technician - Ministry of Industry Orders Promotion of Planting</h3>
<p>China News Agency reports that our nation's cinnamon, produced in Yunnan, Guizhou, and various border counties of Guangdong and Guangxi, is cultivated both artificially and naturally. The annual total output accounts for 65% of the world's total. Since the opening of trade, sales have been very brisk, but it has only been used as a medicinal tonic. Recently, a French perfume chemist invented a method to produce special essences, which are a major ingredient for various high-quality perfumes, soaps, and face powders. Not only is the fragrance pure and rich, but it can also maintain the aroma of other mixtures and prevent them from dissipating. Therefore, recent sales have been increasingly active. After the International Trade Bureau reported this to the Ministry of Industry, in addition to ordering the relevant departments in the four provinces to actively promote planting, it also ordered the bureau to continue to pay attention to overseas promotion efforts.</p>

<h3>Ciyou Association and Hudong Public Society Jointly Organize: Graduation Ceremony Held at Nursery School - Today at 5 PM - Total of 12 Graduating Children</h3>
<p>On April 1, 1933, the China Ciyou Association and the Hudong Public Society, recognizing that the Yangshupu area is filled with factories and that female workers are burdened by work and have difficulty caring for their children, which is detrimental to the children's well-being, jointly established the Shanghai Ciyou Nursery School at 1519 Yangshupu Bridge to alleviate the suffering of workers, assist them in raising their children, and increase their work efficiency. The school's organization is divided into two departments: infant and kindergarten. The infant department admits boys and girls aged two to four, and the kindergarten department admits boys and girls aged four to six.

Children are sent to the school by their families at 10:00 AM every day (except Sundays) and picked up at 5:00 PM. Lunch and afternoon snacks are provided by the school. The education of children focuses on scientific childcare and enlightening teaching. The environment is beautiful and the equipment is suitable. The school's teachers visit the children's families once a week and hold a parent-teacher conference once a month to establish close contact and cooperation with the children's families. Since its establishment nearly two and a half years ago, it has been widely praised by the general working class due to its perfect management and outstanding achievements.

<h3>Brief Discussion on Lotus Blooming in Gu Garden</h3>
<p>The lotus pond in Gu Garden, located west of Kunshan Station and east of Zhenyi Station on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, has been known for its precious double-blooming lotus seeds for hundreds of years. After the descendants of the Gu family and celebrities such as Ye Gongchuo and Ren Xiaoshan jointly organized a management committee with the gentry of Zhenyi Town, they engaged in renovations. This spring, the committee opened another pond next to the original lotus pond and sought seeds of white lotus that had been growing for hundreds of years from the Wei family's garden west of the town and planted them there. As a result, this year's blooming of red and white lotus flowers is more magnificent than in previous years. The white lotus flowers each bloom with a single flower, which is as large as a large bowl, while the red lotus flowers, in addition to the double-blooming lotus (two flowers per stem) and the four-faced Guanyin (four flowers per stem), have up to nine flowers blooming on each stem, resembling peony flowers from afar. As a result, people from Shanghai, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Kunshan, and other places have come to visit and admire the flowers every day. It is said that the Ministry of Railways installed dozens of white stone chairs around the pond this year for visitors to rest. However, Xiao Wuxi, the worker who manages the pond and pavilion, took this opportunity to prepare tea and snacks for visitors to taste and drink, and his business has tripled since the lotus flowers bloomed. It is also said that the Wang Kai Photo Studio in Shanghai recently sent photographers to the countryside to take many films of the famous flowers for display in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Woman Casts Herself into the River Due to Grievances</h3>
<p>Zhang Quanmei, a young woman of 21 from Liyang, lived at 34 Minghua Fang, Tilanqiao, Huishan Road. Last month, her husband had her transport more than a hundred dan of rice back to Liyang for sale. After selling all the rice, she received more than 500 yuan in banknotes, which she hid in her handbag. She stayed at an inn that night, but at 11:00 PM, an acquaintance, someone named Jia, knocked on the door and entered to chat. Taking advantage of the opportunity, he stole her handbag, which contained the banknotes, a pair of gold bracelets, two gold rings, and a watch. When Zhang Quanmei discovered the theft, he had already disappeared. After returning to Shanghai, her husband did not believe her and beat and scolded her, causing her to become increasingly resentful and world-weary. The night before last, she left alone and walked to the Bund on Nanjing Road after midnight. She jumped into the river in an attempt to commit suicide. The sound of her jump alerted two sampan men nearby, who immediately went to rescue her. She was sent to the Customs Water Police Station, where she explained the reason for her suicide and claimed that she had swallowed a gold ring before jumping into the river. The police chief, seeing that she was determined to die, immediately summoned her husband to the police station and persuaded him. The two were sent to the local court yesterday morning, and the court was asked to request the Liyang government to arrest the original thief and investigate the matter.</p>

<p>An Incident in Purchasing the Song Dynasty Collection</p>
<p>Yunnan is remote and far away, but the people are very devout Buddhists. Abbot Haimen of Jianquan Temple in Shun Ning, who is diligent in practice and constantly striving, is especially respected by the public. Previously, he heard that the photoprinted Song Dynasty Qisha edition of the Great Tibetan Sutra was being sold in Shanghai. He made a special wish to purchase a copy for the temple, saving on food and clothing and mortgaging farmland to obtain 1,300 Yunnan coins, equivalent to 545 Shanghai coins, and entrusted the Kunming Changmeili Company to remit the funds for purchase. However, the company delayed for three years and embezzled the funds, failing to remit them. Abbot Haimen had no choice but to present the situation to the magistrate of Shun Ning County, who was greatly angered and has requested the mayor of Kunming to strictly pursue the recovery of the funds in order to fulfill the initial wish of completing the canon.</p>

<h3>Correspondence</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor: I have just read a news item in your newspaper of the 15th of this month, titled "Finance Department Forbids British-American Tobacco Company from Growing Tobacco in Xuchang." Upon investigation, the British-American Tobacco Company has not submitted a request to establish tobacco-growing facilities in Xuchang, nor has this office reported to the ministry to warn the company to cease growing. This is clearly based on inaccurate rumors. Therefore, I am writing to request that your newspaper promptly correct this matter to avoid misleading the public. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated. Respectfully, General Affairs Section, Taxation Department, Ministry of Finance. August 15th.</p>
<p>Furthermore, please note that "拱" in yesterday's newspaper should have been "烘." To the esteemed editor: I have examined a news article in your newspaper of the 15th of this month, under the local news section, titled "Carpenter Sues Doctor for Unwarrantedly Removing Hand." The article mentions that Lu Mingyao from Jiangdu graduated from Tongde Medical College. Upon checking, our college's past graduates do not include anyone named Lu Mingyao. This is clearly based on inaccurate rumors. I am writing to request a correction and hope it can be published in the "Corrections" column to clarify the truth. Respectfully, Tongde Medical College. August 15th.</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Xie Zhongwen)</p>
<p>When cleverness and foolishness are properly employed, both the clever and the foolish become admirable individuals in the world.</p>
<p>Cleverness teaches one to conserve effort and save time to overcome difficulties; foolishness teaches one to persist and advance bravely to overcome difficulties.</p>
<p>The wisdom of the clever and the courage of the foolish are both sources of all creation.</p>
<p>When cleverness and foolishness are improperly employed, both the clever and the foolish become detestable individuals in the world.</p>
<p>Cleverness becomes mere trickery, and foolishness becomes a stimulant for reckless action.</p>
<p>The cunning of the clever and the obstinacy of the foolish both become factors that disrupt society.</p>
<p>We need the wisdom of the clever, not their cunning, and the courage of the foolish, not their obstinacy.</p>
<p>However, in society, we only see cunning people harming others, and no foolish people willing to take losses!</p>
<h3>Supplement to the Biography of Wang Junqing</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>The Wuxing lyricist Wang Junqing has passed away. I have already written an article to mourn him, but there are still things left unsaid, so I write again here.</p>
<p>When the lyricist was building his Xinjiang Villa in Wumen, before moving, he asked me to introduce him to some fellow poets, hoping for literary gatherings in the future. Unexpectedly, a rogue youth, impersonating the poet Jin Jihe, asked the lyricist for a loan. The lyricist generously lent him some money and wrote to me describing the youth's appearance, asking if he was indeed Jin Jihe. I was greatly surprised upon receiving the letter because Jin Jihe was tall and slender, with a refined demeanor, unlike the shabby person described in the letter. When Jin Jihe found out, he invited the lyricist to a restaurant to clarify the matter, suggesting he bring someone to identify the tall man to avoid confusion. This double impersonation case became a humorous anecdote among our peers.</p>
<p>I met the lyricist several years ago, and we became close friends at first sight, forming a friendship that transcended age. At that time, I had just suffered through the January 28th Incident, losing my home and family possessions, and my sorrow was expressed in my writings. The lyricist comforted me with sincere words, saying, "If you have any urgent needs, please do not hesitate to tell me. I will do what I can to help." I politely declined, but his kindness was truly touching.</p>
<p>In the early years of the Republic of China, the lyricist vowed to compile biographies of women, aiming to add glory to the female world, including figures like Qiu Jin and Hua Yinmei. Unfortunately, due to certain circumstances, this project never materialized, which is a great pity.</p>
<p>Zhu Minyi, a member of the Central Committee, received early guidance from the lyricist and always treated him with the respect due to a teacher. Some compared this relationship to that of Wang Zhaoming and Zhu Jiangcun, or Yu Youren and Shen Jianchao. However, the lyricist never asked for any favors, as his mind was serene and detached, with no desire for personal gain.</p>
<p>The lyricist was on good terms with Grand Historian Cheng Zongyi. Upon hearing of the lyricist's passing, the Grand Historian composed two poems of condolence. At his request, I am publishing them here to conclude my writing: "I admired you at first sight in Duntang, the news of your passing in Wuzhong shocked me, I am saddened by my lack of opportunity to visit your home (You repeatedly invited me to Suzhou), Your ability to proofread and your touch to improve texts are impressive (You made a living by editing books), You had hoped for a son like Xiangshan to forget aging, Our friendship can be compared to Fan Shi, to take responsibility for life, There is still a promise unfulfilled to write the epitaph on the monument for a former colleague (You asked me to write the epitaph for the tomb of Huang Jiuyan, a Ming Dynasty Jinshi, but because of the humidity, my hands were unable to finish), Tears flow to the ends of the earth as a response. The stars are lonely after dawn, I quietly think of you, Your works and scattered writings are truly pitiable, I savor the flavor of poetry in the Yun Song Collection (People in Shanghai used to say that his poetry style was from Oubei), I carefully selected content for the Xibao Editorial (Referring to the annotated Yao Xuan's Selections of Ancient Prose). We shared the waters and bamboos of the Xuan Mian Garden, The writing desk still is always the fields, How could you buried next to Yao Li's tomb and still have English wind to remember the past." The lyricist's character can be seen in these poems.</p>
<h3>Put in Some Effort</h3>
<p>— Juan Yin</p>
<h3>Talking About Pointe Shoes</h3>
<p>— Yiqiu</p>
<p>"Dancing can beautify all the gestures and movements of a woman," I remember an artist saying. Having been involved in the world of song and dance for many years, I have proven the accuracy of this view through experience.</p>
<p>Pointe dancing is the highest peak of dance art and can make a person graceful, because this type of dance is elastic. It can turn any heavy or dull woman into a light and elegant beauty. However, in China, strictly speaking, only Gong Qiuxia and Pan Wenjuan are truly capable of dancing en pointe.</p>
<p>Some Jianghu troupes that perform magic and martial arts will have one or two little girls come out to dance en pointe at the beginning of their performances, but that kind of leaping that only raises the heel with the front toes fully touching the ground cannot be called pointe dancing.</p>
<p>In foreign countries, dancing on pointe is very common. General dances are composed of pointe steps. However, in China, where all arts are pitifully lacking—dance is no exception! Pointe dancing is indeed considered precious.</p>
<p>According to Ms. Wei Yingbo, the reason for the scarcity of pointe dance talent is that Chinese song and dance practitioners lack perseverance. It is not easy to dance on pointe on stage for ten minutes. It requires a lot of hard work to succeed.</p>
<p>Ms. Gong Qiuxia has married and left the world of song and dance for many years. Only Ms. Pan Wenjuan is still making progress. She is currently performing in Southeast Asia. It is said that overseas Chinese audiences are deeply impressed and warmly welcome Ms. Pan's pointe dancing. Local newspapers have published special articles on Ms. Pan, praising her as a "Song and Dance Master" with genuine talent and skills, so popular for a while. According to someone in the song and dance industry, in Southeast Asia, the most prestigious group of Chinese song and dance is the Voice of Plum Blossom, but Ms. Pan Wenjuan is the most popular individual. This shows that true honor is not something that can be obtained by chance. It is hoped that the general female song and dance performers will not rely on luck again, thinking that learning a few flirty glances and smiles is a big deal. It must be known that in the near future, girls with only shallow skills and no real ability will be naturally eliminated.</p>
<h3>The Amusements of Lotus Root Cottage</h3>
<p>— (Shen Shou Ruo)</p>
<p>The famous scholar of Yunjian, Mr. Yang Jiyuan, was broad-minded and elegant during his lifetime. He once appreciated the scenery of the Bund in the Huangpu area and lived next door to women of the goddess profession. Mr. Yang lived there peacefully, without considering it a disgrace to dwell in such surroundings. He named his residence "Lotus Root Cottage." When people asked about the meaning of the name, Mr. Yang happily explained that he compared himself to the pure and lofty lotus root, which remains untainted even when surrounded by mud. The meaning of this residence can be described as amusing.</p>

<p>The accountant smiled and said, "Mr. Zhang is truly meticulous, even practicing a lot beforehand." Jie Fu extended his thumb and raised his head, saying, "My handwriting is recognizable to Commissioner Lan at a glance. I haven't written large characters for more than two months, so my brushwork has regressed a bit. If Commissioner Lan arrives tomorrow and mentions that the characters were written by me, and he sees that my handwriting has regressed, I am sure to be reprimanded. There is a saying that one should not fear officials, only those who manage them. Who can help the fact that my position is lower than his?" Hearing him say such things, the accountant felt even more that he had a close relationship with Commissioner Lan. Therefore, after he finished writing the slogans, he immediately went to the front of the store to spread the word, saying that no wonder the Zhang gentleman living in the backyard was going to write slogans to welcome Commissioner Lan. It turned out that he was a subordinate of Commissioner Lan. He shouldn't have given him a bill and asked for money the day before yesterday. However, since the bill had already been given, and he hadn't paid yet, he should relax a little on him in the future. Speaking of the Little Western Paradise Inn, it often housed high-ranking officials. The arrival of a wealthier person was not a big deal. However, this time, Commissioner Lan seemed to have promoted himself for a while. Newspapers from south to north had already reported on it. Local newspapers in Xi'an had naturally reported on it as well. Knowledgeable people felt that he was just a second or third-rate important person and didn't pay much attention. This accountant was still an amateur when it came to officials, and couldn't resist Jie Fu's repeated statements that he was a central government official. Usually, when central government officials came, they stayed at the only luxurious guesthouse in the provincial capital, Xincheng Hotel. This time, a big official came, but he didn't stay at Xincheng Hotel, but at the inn. He was like Bao Zheng on a private visit, coming to investigate the good and bad of the people. It would be better to be more respectful. (291)</p>
<h3>Incense Drifting Record</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Her voice was very low and trembling, probably because she was too happy at the moment. When people are too happy, their hearts often tremble.</p>
<p>"Let's hurry and pick those pale green lotuses," the Empress Dowager said again. "Before we have breakfast, let's put them in a clean vase to offer them before the statue of the Guanyin Bodhisattva. Such rare and wondrous flowers should be offered to the Bodhisattva first!"</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager was very devout in her worship of the Guanyin Bodhisattva, and I myself had a considerable amount of faith. However, at this moment, my mind was still preoccupied with the governor who had been sent to Heilongjiang, so I didn't pay attention to this point. But later, I decided to let go of this troublesome matter and focus on watching the eunuchs who had been ordered by the Empress Dowager to pick lotuses, rowing small boats back and forth in the lotus bushes. The Empress Dowager kept having people shout loudly to guide them. Before we returned to the palace, in addition to the green lotuses offered to the Bodhisattva, several baskets were also filled with ordinary pink lotuses. The Empress Dowager was truly pleased today!</p>
<p>Chapter 32: The Empress Dowager's Dressing Table</p>
<p>Long before Westerners dazzled the world with makeup techniques, our Empress Dowager had long discovered many beauty secrets, some of which have yet to be discovered by others! So I confirmed at that time that every morning before the court, going with the Empress Dowager to her dressing room to watch her slowly and methodically put on makeup was equivalent to taking a "beauty class," and we could always get new experiences, and we would never stand for half a day in vain. Because the old lady was always very careful in the engineering of facial makeup. (391)</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>Rebirth</h3>
<p>— Wu Yafei</p>
<p>Suddenly, I received a letter from Ming. He told me that he had arrived in Changsha and was working as a Dean of Discipline in a rural experimental middle school. He said: "Although I have become disillusioned with the education field and am indeed a bit tired of the education profession, I also feel somewhat doubtful about myself. Now I have finally been drawn into the vortex of education again. If it were an ordinary middle school, I might have decided not to do it, but this is a rural experimental middle school, so I am willing to sacrifice my own principles and become a pioneer in rural education..."</p>
<p>Ming is a complete pessimist. When he opens his mouth, it's always with a pessimistic tone, talking about sorrow and worries! He often had them hanging on the corners of his mouth, and it was rare to see a smile on his face. Usually, he would hide at home all day, studying his philosophy of life. Although he and I were classmates and fellow villagers, we were very different in temperament, so we were aloof from each other, but we were more intimate than with other friends.</p>
<p>Although I opposed his pessimism, I understood his pain and sometimes sincerely tried to persuade or comfort him. Even if I couldn't reduce the amount of his sorrow and worries, he could take me as a confidant.</p>
<p>"Fei, you are the only one who knows me in my life! You are my true confidant. There is no one else besides you! Even my parents and siblings cannot understand me!" he often said to me.</p>
<p>"Ming, being a person is just playing in the world, living one day at a time. You should do what you want to do in your heart and not do what you don't want to do. Why are you so serious? You are too hard on yourself! How can there be anything completely satisfactory or anyone completely happy in the world?" I often comforted him like this.</p>
<p>He had attempted suicide three times, but his family managed to save him. I didn't sympathize with him for his suicide, but instead blamed him heavily. Later, he seemed to have realized something, so whenever I went to blame him, he always expressed infinite shame!</p>
<p>"One must be brave, the more one suffers, the stronger one's will becomes, especially a young person. One should not be discouraged but needs to work hard and struggle to remove the obstacles in front of you!"</p>
<p>Indeed, he has changed now. This change has made him a brand new and ambitious young man. He struggled out of the net of his previous depression and created his new life. The reason for his recent change is that he has a lover who understands him better than I do, who is encouraging him and revitalizing his withering soul.</p>
<p>Last month, due to the encouragement of that lover, he left Shanghai and went to Changsha with her to be pioneers in rural education. At the same time, it was the beginning of their pure and happy life.</p>
<p>When I received this good news, how happy I was!</p>
<p>"He is reborn, our Ming's life has a purpose, and the soul of this new person has a home!" I couldn't help but say silently.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Issues Instructions to National Northeastern University for Earnest Improvement</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued instructions on the 15th to National Northeastern University, stating in brief that the university had previously been instructed to comply with the key points for improvement suggested by the ministry. According to reports from inspectors, the university has paid attention to discipline and the students are diligent and hardworking. The teaching in the College of Engineering is conscientious, which is commendable. The university has complied with the previous instructions to reorganize the departments. The points that should be improved in the future are suggested below:</p>
<p>1.  The original classes in the Department of Foreign Languages, the Department of Law, and the Department of Education of the university have been terminated and should not be established again. The Departments of History and Geography, the Departments of Political Economy, and the Departments of Chinese and Border Administration should enroll students once every other year. This year, the Departments of History and Geography and Border Administration will enroll students. The Department of Border Administration already has groups studying Japanese and Russian. This year, it can enroll a Russian group at its discretion.</p>
<p>2.  Next year, the College of Engineering will only enroll freshmen in the Department of Civil Engineering. The Department of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering will be suspended, but it can set up an Electrical Engineering Specialty at its discretion. The original students in the Department of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering can be sent to other schools for further study or transferred to the Electrical Engineering Specialty at its discretion.</p>
<p>3.  There are too many part-time teachers. This should be greatly reduced and replaced with excellent full-time teachers to meet the requirement that part-time teachers should not exceed two-thirds of the total number of teachers. The selection and hiring must be prudent.</p>
<p>4.  The university's annual funding is 300,000 yuan. According to the minimum standards set by the ministry, 15% should be used for equipment expenses, i.e., 45,000 yuan per year, plus the special equipment subsidy from the Ministry of Finance of 20,000 yuan per year, totaling 65,000 yuan. This amount should be used for the purchase of books, instruments, and equipment for the colleges.</p>
<p>5.  There are too many administrative personnel in the university. This should be strictly reduced to save on expenditures. Matters related to the university's reforms should be submitted to the university affairs and academic affairs meetings for discussion and decision. The above is hereby ordered for compliance and reporting.</p>

They arrived in Shanghai on the 1st of last month from Quanzhou, visiting the Gongxue Tuan, Nian Er She, Huangdu Rural Teachers' School, and Lida Agricultural Science Education Center, among other places.

Chairman Han of the provincial government telegraphed the counties to provide protection, so the delegation's journey was very convenient. They also followed the Jinpu Railway to Dezhou, Jingxian in Hebei, Fucheng, Wuqiang, Raoyang, Anping, Boye, and Dingxian counties, and then along the Banhan Line to Baoding. In all the places they visited, they toured various construction projects and other social education organizations and groups.

<h3>Zhang Taiyan to Lecture in Suzhou; Lectures to Begin on September 16th</h3>
<p>Yu Hang Zhang Taiyan, a master of classical learning, has been enjoying himself writing books since he settled in Suzhou. This spring, the National Government sent him 10,000 yuan to show respect for the elderly. Zhang used the funds to prepare for a lecture series, building a lecture hall, providing seating, and inviting scholars from all directions to come to Suzhou to listen to the lectures and reside in the meeting hall. It is understood that the preparations for the meeting have been completed, and all lecture halls, dormitories, and lounges have been completed. The lecture classes set up during the summer vacation have also ended. From September 16th, a formal and large-scale lecture series will begin. Scholars from other provinces are being sought to register. The charter will be sent upon request. The address of the meeting is No. 50 Jinfan Road, Suzhou City. It is said that scholars from various places, even from remote provinces, are registering in an endless stream. In the future, the revival of national studies and the flourishing of culture will depend on this one line of hope. It is also heard that from September onwards, the association will publish a bi-monthly journal called "Zhi Yan," which will focus on elucidating national studies. The content will be classified, provisionally including categories such as "General Theory," "Special Studies," "Glossary," "Women's Garden," "Special Records," and "Miscellaneous Records."

<h3>Reorganization of Shanghai County Middle School; Former Principal Fan Chongheng Not Removed from Office</h3>
<p>A letter from the Shanghai County Education Bureau stated, "Dear Sirs, Today's education news column in your newspaper published an item on the county-run junior middle school, with the headline 'County-Run Junior Middle School Principal Removed from Office and Another Appointed.' Although the school is being reorganized according to the Education Department's order, there is no mention of removing the former principal, Fan Chongheng, from office. Moreover, the report issued by the provincial supervisor stated that 'administrative facilities are extremely serious.' The reorganization was only carried out because the graduation examination results of the students taking the provincial examination this year were relatively poor. It was not a suspension. We respectfully request that you make a correction to avoid causing confusion. Sincerely, Shanghai County Education Bureau, August 15, 24th year."</p>
<h3>Alumni of Liangjiang School to Meet Today; at Zhengxing Girls' Middle School on Seymour Road</h3>

Their origins are scattered throughout the provinces and cities of the country. Most of them serve at home and abroad, and their achievements have long been known to society. The school's reputation has grown in recent years due to its progress in construction and its efforts in promoting practical education. This year marks the 15th anniversary, and the alumni attach great importance to the school's hard work and difficult management over the years. A grand celebration is planned. A meeting will be held first in Shanghai by various schools, and then the entire group will be gradually contacted to carry out preparations. Huang Daping, the principal of Zhengxing Girls' Middle School, and Jiang Lixian of Great China University, both alumni of the school, have initiated and convened a meeting of alumni in Shanghai, scheduled for 3:00 PM today in the auditorium of Zhengxing Girls' Middle School on Seymour Road. The agenda for discussion will be divided into two main parts: (1) How to gather other graduates and carry out preparatory work for a grand celebration to mark the 15th anniversary of the school this winter. (2) How should the graduates maintain close contact with each other and discuss ways to contribute to the development of women's physical education? All will be discussed.</p>
<h3>American Legal Scholar Dr. Pound Arrives in Shanghai</h3>

<p>The excellent table tennis skills of Shanghai's female table tennis players, such as Zheng Lihua, Lü Chaofan, Zhang Jiazhen, Chen Yuanqing, and Zhang Juting, have long been recognized.

<h3>Little Men (16)</h3>
<p>— Original work by Ms. Louisa May Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang (Zonghai)</p>
<p>Pomponio was the leader of the attacking party, and Nat defended his chamber with a bravery and persistence worthy of all praise. He picked up the cushions as fast as they were thrown, till the besiegers’ ammunition was all gone; then they rallied for a final assault, to recover their lost arms. Some slight bruises were given and received, but no one minded, and every one took and gave resounding whacks with perfect good nature, while the pillows flew like snowflakes, till Mrs. Jo, looking at her watch, cried out,—</p>
<p>“Time’s up, boys! Into bed, great and small, or there’ll be a penalty.”</p>
<p>“What penalty?” asked Ned, sitting up, eager to know what would be done to any daring spirit who defied this most singular and philanthropic of schoolmistresses.</p>
<p>“No play next time,” answered Mrs. Jo. “I give them five minutes to settle down, then the lights go out, and order must be restored. They are boys of honor, and they will keep their word.”</p>
<p>Which, indeed, they did. For the cessation of hostilities was as sudden as the beginning,—a farewell fling, a final cheer,—as Nat launched a seventh cushion at the retreating foe,—a few boasts about what they would do next time, and then order was perfectly restored; only a few chuckles and whispers broke the silence which followed the uproar, as Mrs. Jo kissed her new boarder, and left him to dream all sorts of happy dreams of Plumfield life.</p>

<h3>Finance: Rumors of US Purchasing Large Amounts of Silver, Gold Market Suddenly Collapses, Heavy Selling Pressure Surrounds, Bank Notes Plunge, Breaks Through Four Major Levels, Plunges to 18.2 Yuan</h3>
<p>The gold market overseas experienced a sharp contraction yesterday due to rumors of the US halting silver purchases. However, major players in the market had already become suspicious. Indeed, after the market opened, news refuting the US Treasury Secretary's statement spread, causing gold prices to plummet repeatedly and struggle to recover. At the beginning of the morning, overseas silver markets in both the UK and the US reported sharp declines. However, market players stated that the market had continued to decline by 0.25 after closing and that the US had purchased silver at that price. The forward silver price in Montreux plunged by 1.52 to 1.72. Exchange rates generally increased. Spot gold in London contracted by 1.5 pence. In off-market pre-market trading, bids were called at 25.56 yuan, but there were no transactions. Chunyuan, Yongfuxing, Yongda, Fayongheng, Yu Dachangxiang, and Dada all sold. The price immediately dropped from 22 yuan to 19 yuan. This was due to the Reuters London silver market report, which stated that the US had aggressively purchased over 15 million ounces of silver during the sharp decline. The general psychology was that the report of the US stopping silver purchases was unfounded, fueling the fear of selling. However, although Shenfeng, Wanxing, Yongli, Huixiang, and others were still buying at lower prices, Yongchang, Yuanmao, Yongyuqing, Yongfuyu, Hengchang, and Yongheng were still selling, causing the price to fall to 17.18 yuan. After the market opened, the Central Bank's listing was announced, with both the UK and the US remaining unchanged. Customs gold units contracted by 0.03 yuan. The benchmark price for Standard Gold was reduced to 930.6 yuan, making it difficult to recover. Major players such as Hengchang, Yongfuxing, Yongfuyu, Yuanmao, and Yongchunyuan aggressively sold, causing the price to fall sharply. A Reuters report stated that the US Treasury Secretary announced that the amount of silver purchased today had exceeded 25 million ounces, indicating that the silver purchasing program would continue. Additionally, Thomas advocated for a thorough investigation into the silver purchasing program. The price then retreated into the 10 yuan range. Despite some fluctuations, the exchange market remained surprisingly tight. Bank notes were aggressively sold again. In addition, an Associated Press report stated that the US Treasury Secretary dismissed the rumors of stopping silver purchases as unfounded and said that the amount of silver coin coupons currently in circulation exceeded the silver reserves by a significant amount, and the government should continue to purchase enough silver. This further fueled the selling pressure, causing the price to break through the 900 yuan level again. Soon after, it retreated into the 890 yuan range. Banks continued to seek settlements. It was also reported that the Central Bank had started spot trading, and buyers were actively purchasing at lower prices, causing the selling pressure to subside slightly and the price to recover by about 8 yuan. Banks took advantage of the high prices to sell, but there was still congestion from the mainland. The predicted price increase for Indian silver was twelve annas, but the price increase was hindered. The afternoon trend weakened again. In the afternoon market, the forward premium fell after the sellers offered a half-yuan discount, causing sentiment to improve slightly and the price to rise to above 5 yuan. The Indian silver price was reported to have risen by nineteen annas, triggering a reversal. After the opening, the price was flat. HSBC sought some settlements. The market was weak but stabilized, and the forward premium gradually decreased. There were several attempts to pull up the price, but market sentiment remained depressed. After that, the price fluctuated intermittently without any significant changes. In the end, the market lacked support. In the afternoon, Reuters re-reported the negative news, causing a sudden drop in price and pushing it back into the 90-yuan range. The situation became more precarious. Banks continued to seek settlements. The market closed flat and stabilized. After the market closed, the Indian silver price was soft but stable. This session’s forward market saw the short side offer a discount of 1.3 yuan to 0.8 yuan. The day’s market conditions are recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 917 yuan, which was a slight increase of 0.3 yuan compared to the previous closing. However, it was significantly lower than the post-closing and evening dark trading prices. Fuyu, Fuxing, Yongda, Fayong, Chunyuan, and Yongjin still rose to 8 yuan. The Central Bank's listing was announced, with customs gold units contracting by 0.03 yuan. Hengyu, Fu and Yong, Huixiang, Yuanchang, Yonghengchang, and Yong Yongli Dadesheng Yisheng sold notes, causing the price to fall to 4.8 yuan. Huabi bought September US dollars at 0.0625.

Richang, Fuxing, Yongfuyu, Hengyu, Yingxiang, Lichang, and Hengchang Yong sold notes again, causing the price to retreat to 1.5 yuan. Shenfeng, Hengyu, and Dadesheng still rose to 2.7 yuan. Hengchang, Yongfuxing, Yongzhengchang, Wanfeng, Dafa, Yongfusheng, and Yong Dada Yuanmao Yongchunyuan and others repeatedly sold notes. It was anticipated that HSBC Bank's listing, although reduced by 0.0125 and 0.025 yuan, would break through the 10 yuan level to 0.06 yuan due to the Reuters report that the US Treasury Secretary announced that it would aggressively purchase more than 25 million ounces of silver today and that it would continue the silver purchasing policy. Fuxing Yongyicheng Dadesheng received notes. Maccari bought September US dollars at 5.625, causing the price to rise to 9.8 yuan. Hengchang Yongfuxing Yong sold at 8.1 yuan.

Chunyuan Yong Dada Dadesheng came in, causing the price to rise back to 901.5 yuan. An Associated Press report stated that the US Treasury Secretary indicated that the rumors were unfounded, that the number of silver yuan circulating tickets exceeded the amount of silver reserves by a lot, and that the silver purchase would continue. The selling pressure was still strong. Shenfeng Fuyu Wanxing Yuanyi Dada Huixiang Fuxing Yong competed to sell, causing the price to break through the 900 yuan level again, falling to 895 yuan. Yuanmao Yong Yongli Hanhang Yuxinxiang took advantage of the lower prices to replenish their positions. Huabi bought September US dollars at 0.0625 and 0.0125, causing the price to rise to 7 yuan. Yuanmao Yong Huixiang Dada Hongkang Yong Shunmao Tong Taichang Ran sold, causing the price to fall to 2 yuan.

Chunyuan Yong posted a premium and stabilized. The closing price was a seller's premium. After the market closed, Yongfeng Fuxing Yong Futaiting offered a premium. Although Hengxing offered a premium, it still rose to approximately 1.2 yuan. Dadesheng Yiyu Dafa Yong Fuxing Yong offered a premium. Finally, it was approximately 1 yuan with a high early and low later price dynamic, reflecting the impact of the Central Bank's spot market opening and subsequent decline.</p>
<h3>Chinese Merchants Frantically Dumping, Foreign Exchange Gradually Easing, British Gold Tightens by Half a Penny, US Increases by 1.0625 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign wires reported that the London large gold bars had all fallen 0.75. Market players stated that the market had further contracted 0.25 and that the US had purchased the gold at that price. The New York silver market contracted by 1.625. The forward silver price in Montreux also fell 1.52 to 1.72. Spot gold in London contracted by 2.5 pence. The pound rose 0.75 against the dollar. The pound remained unchanged against the franc. The dollar rose 0.375 against the pound. The dollar rose 0.75 against the franc. The opening price for recent sales was a price of 1 shilling and 5.25 pence for the pound and a price of 35.75 yuan for the US dollar, a tightening of 0.125 for the pound and a tightening of 0.3125 for the dollar compared to the previous close. However, due to the Chinese merchants' perception that the large market report stated that the US had aggressively purchased 25 million ounces during the sharp decline, it was difficult to confirm whether the report that the US would stop the silver purchasing program was true. As a result, the market weakened. The Central Bank's listing was announced, with both the UK and the US remaining unchanged. Customs gold fell 0.03 yuan. Chinese merchants then came to frantically sell, causing the market to loosen. Although the banks sought settlements, the supply was greater than the demand, making it difficult to maintain. As a result, although the HSBC listing contracted by 0.125 and 0.25, the Reuters report stated that the US Treasury Secretary and Thomas had both made favorable comments on silver prices, increasing the selling pressure. Chinese merchants, confident that there would be congestion from the mainland, became even more aggressive. Although there were struggles, the trend became increasingly loose and excessive due to unfavorable news reports from the Associated Press. Foreign banks took advantage of the low prices to maintain their positions, resulting in a stable market. Although there was a tightening in the afternoon, the potential trend was still difficult to be optimistic about at noon. The predicted increase for Indian silver was twelve annas, and there was still selling pressure from the mainland. The afternoon market was flat, and although the banks were buying, the Indian silver price increased by nineteen and twenty annas. Jewish merchants such as Qiao Zhifu made some sales, but the Chinese merchants' sentiment was still difficult to improve. In the end, they were unable to maintain and sold one after another, causing the market to tighten. At the close of trading, the selling price for recent sales was 1 shilling and 5.875 pence for the pound and 37.125 yuan for the US dollar, a tightening of half a penny for the pound and a tightening of 1.0625 yuan for the US dollar compared to the previous close. Chinese merchants unanimously dumped frantically. The Dalian gang, due to the sharp decline in the gold market, sold US dollars, with total selling of approximately 400,000 pounds and 1 million yuan. Chinese brokers also sold, and foreign merchants settled their accounts.</p>
<h3>Money Market Conditions Seem to Have Become Active</h3>
<p>The money market conditions during this month have been largely sluggish in the first half of the month, with no signs of activity. As a result, commercial firms generally felt depleted. Now, as the sluggish period of the first half of the month has passed, it seems that the market is slightly more active from what was observed. It is said that money lenders are willing to make concessions to trustworthy business firms, and although actual loans for small businesses haven't been made on a grand scale, they will reach their goals in the end, giving comfort to those who have been hoping for rain. The call loan interest rate in yesterday's market was 0.01 yuan better than the previous day, coming in at 0.19 yuan, however, the transaction volume was still not very high, because money lenders were unwilling to supply as much loans and interbank call loans as they could. Head balances were abundant, so it came out to nothing, even in the small associations there were some fluctuations, because supply exceeded demand, it always came out to nothing.</p>
<p>The transaction volume for call loans was 3.1 million yuan in the early market, the new transaction volume was 500,000 yuan, the afternoon transaction volume was 200,000 yuan, the small associations transaction volume was 300,000 yuan, the pawnshops money volume was 700,000 yuan, with only 400,000 in made goods. 700,000 yuan in banknotes were retracted, 500,000 yuan in memo cards were issued, and there was only 200,000 yuan circulating, 300,000 came from passenger traffic, and 150,000 was taken. 5.2 million in foreign public bonds were sold by the money shops, 5.34 million were sold by foreign head balances, 500,000 yuan in remittance loans came from various roads, and more than 100,000 were traded in spot trading. The banks collected 1.45 million in banknotes, 4 million for cargo, mortgages, and other miscellaneous fees, and more than 300,000 in exchange fees. 500,000 for electrical domestic remittances, 300,000 for domestic, and 1 million for storage, and 1.45 million for repayment of foreign rice. 1.9 million in banknotes were collected by the Chinese banks, 3.1 million for cargo, mortgages, taxes, and other miscellaneous fees, 890,000 in foreign exchange, 400,000 domestic for electrical remittances, 500,000 for foreign electrical remittances, 700,000 for special exchange fees, and 600,000 in warehouse release. 2.7 million in Feng loans were collected by the Japanese banks, a little under 4 million for cargo, freight, and other expenses, over 800,000 for electrical remittances, 700,000 for special fees, and 500,000 for foreign exchange and warehouse releases. It seems that the present air in the market is much better than that of the dog days of summer. The market for subsidiary coins has remained the same throughout, with the market for Xiaojiang small foreign exchange a little over 2 yuan, coming in at 835 yuan in the early market, then down 1 yuan at 834 yuan in the afternoon market, and compared to the early market it seems to be over 2.2 yuan. However, there is no appetite for buying, and the market price would soar immediately if there was a buying spree. 5,000 in early market trading and 2,000 in afternoon trading, The market for Guangdong small foreign exchange was 735.3 in the early market and 730 in the afternoon, and compared to the previous market, it seems to be 0.7 yuan. The early market traded 115,000 and the afternoon market traded 30,000. Copper coins gained 1,500 characters, to 343,000 characters, 51,450 transactions, worth 15,000 foreign exchange, again in this city 15,943,2393.3 yuan. The exchange volume was 4,939,498.28 yuan, the remittance volume was 7,871,099.7 yuan, and the collection volume was 3,408,145.9 yuan and 308,809.42 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities Large Investors Sell on Rises; Bond Market Experiences Initial Gains Followed by Setbacks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange continued to show strong market conditions. Northern investors were actively buying, with the 14th issue being the most sought after. The 2nd and 49th issues were also in strong demand. Other sporadic purchases were also quite lively. Although the volume of transactions was not large, the demand clearly exceeded the supply. However, issues such as 11, 21, 47, and 48 were being sold. While the 48th issue did not have a large amount released, it was sold whenever the price rose, or used for swaps. Generally, the trend has not broken out of consolidation. Market news is dull. If the 48th issue does not surge onto the market, the market price should not fall sharply. Yesterday's activity, with initial gains followed by setbacks, was due to large investors selling on rises. The overall trend is still struggling. At the opening, issues 14 and 49 were bought, while sellers such as issues 21 and 48 slowly sold off, tightening the market slightly. In the afternoon, the market weakened slightly, falling back about a dime. Issue 696 was relatively strong. As a result, the market price continued to rise, by 1.5 cents to 3.5 cents. The total turnover was 5,735,000 yuan. The results of the gains and losses are compared in the table below: (Unit: Yuan, Trading Unit: 100 Yuan)</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton The Plunge in Margin Prices and the Situation of Yarn and Cotton; Japanese Estimate a Sharp Decline in China's National Cotton Production This Year</h3>
<p>After the sharp rise in the yarn market the previous day, there was a reaction today, with a rise and fall trend. This situation was entirely affected by the gold rush. The majority of people expected that the silver market would fall sharply and margin prices would rise because the United States stopped buying silver. However, contrary to expectations, it suddenly fell yesterday, with the decline being violent. As a result, the bulls were greatly disappointed, and the market fell in a straight line. However, spot yarn dealers showed development, but other dealers did not show any signs of action.</p>
<p>Many Bulls Emerged in Jinji</p>
<p>Before the opening of the margin yarn market, the crowd believed that the gold price would rise due to the contraction of silver, and the asking price reached 922 yuan. Before long, due to large investors emerging, it quickly fell back, causing the opening of each month to decline consistently and sharply. Due to the sharp fall in margin prices, those with floating profits were panicked. Quite a few people were cutting losses. The market became increasingly difficult to support. Securities dealers worked hard to buy in, relying on this to maintain it. However, the tide of the times was turbulent, and it was difficult to resist alone. The second and third sessions were still weak. By the close, it was heard that there were 1,450 bales of spot yarn transactions in Sichuan the previous day, and sentiment slightly improved, rebounding by 5 dimes. As a result, each month seemed to have fallen by 1.6, 7, and 8 dimes compared with the previous day's close. The market remained weak after the afternoon opening. Margin prices were still hovering at low peaks, but trading in the market was not active. As a result, the current month rose by 2 dimes compared with the morning closing price, and the remaining months fell by 1, 2, 3, and 4 dimes. Osaka Sampin yarn rose by 1.6 yuan to 2.1 yuan. It was found that 1,600 bales of May Kee, 450 bales of Yu Kang, 650 bales of Da Feng, 1,200 bales of Geng Feng, 600 bales of Chang Yu, 1,500 bales of Yuan Yi, 1,250 bales of Chang Feng, 1,850 bales of Run Kang, 1,050 bales of Xin Cheng, 500 bales of De Kee, 600 bales of Yi Cheng, 500 bales of Mao Jin Ji Feng, 2,250 bales of Yi Da, 1,350 bales of Yu Da, 550 bales of Yuan Da, 2,650 bales of Jin Chang, 750 bales of Sen Kang, 1,950 bales of Tai Chang, and 450 bales of Xie Cheng were sold. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for one day are as follows:</p>
<p>Sichuan Dealers' Appetite for Spot Yarn is Still Smooth; Spot Yarn Sales are Still Good. It was found that all dealers bought a total of 1,780 bales, including the amount traded the previous day, and the market was flat. The amount purchased by each dealer is as follows:</p>
<p>Sichuan 1,450 Tianjin 5 Guangdong 60</p>
<p>Inland 140 Xuzhou 15</p>
<p>The cotton market was sluggish, and the trend of decline was also strong. Due to the sharp fall in margin prices by 30 yuan, most bulls were disappointed and began to close out positions, with the most chaotic selling, causing the market to react and fall. However, the bulls in the August period had a strong intention and pulled up urgently, and the decline was relatively slow. According to Japanese estimates, China's national cotton production this year is estimated to be about 9.6 million dan, a decrease of 1.04 million dan compared with 10.64 million dan last year.</p>
<p>Many Disappointments for New Cotton</p>
<p>Before the opening of the margin cotton market, each month tended to decline, and the situation was extremely weak. Because most people expected margin prices to rise the previous day, they were shocked to fall sharply, breaking through the 900 yuan mark. As a result, floating investors showed anxiety again, and the market fell step by step, becoming increasingly weak. As a result, the current month fell by only 1 dime compared with the previous day's close, and the far month fell by 2.5 dimes to 4.5 dimes. After the afternoon opening, it was heard that margin prices were still hovering at low peaks, so there were still many sellers. New cotton in the far month suddenly fell by 3 dimes, hitting a low. In the second and third sessions, it rose slightly by 1 to 2 dimes. The closing was still calm. However, the bulls of large investors remained calm and unmoved. As a result, each month fell by 1 dime to 2.5 dimes compared with the morning closing price. It was found that 5,900 dan of Geng Feng, 2,000 dan of Mei Kee, 1,200 dan of Da Fu, 1,600 dan of Sen Kang, 7,900 dan of Tong Feng, 1,800 dan of Chang Feng, 2,600 dan of Run Kang, 3,000 dan of Yuan Xing Chang, 2,700 dan of Rui Da, and 2,000 dan of Chang He were sold. 2,000 dan of Jun Chang, 2,400 dan of Da Fu, 1,100 dan of Da Feng, 1,300 dan of Chang Chang, 2,000 dan of Yi Cheng, 5,700 dan of Tai Chang, 2,000 dan of Heng Chang, 3,900 dan of Xin Cheng, 1,100 dan of Da Chang, and 1,400 dan of Yi Kang were bought. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for one day are as follows:</p>
<p>Small Amounts of Factory Demand Are Uninterrupted</p>
<p>Consumption of spot cotton is gradually becoming active, and the sporadic needs of various factories are still uninterrupted. The source is 920 bales of Yao cotton and 300 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<p>Hankou Fine Velvet Cotton 43.6 New Yu Factory enters 160 pieces of spot goods to the factory.</p>
<p>Hankou Fine Velvet Cotton 42.50 Da Kang Factory enters 100 pieces of spot goods to the factory.</p>
<p>Fire Engine Cotton 41.00 Shanghai Factory enters 300 bales of spot goods to the factory.</p>
<p>Australian Fine Velvet Cotton 42.25 Heng Da Factory enters 26 pieces of spot goods for warehouse delivery.</p>
<h3>Grains Flour Manufacturers Replenish Near and Sell Far</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market initially showed firmness after opening in the morning, but then fell sharply. However, the current month remained firm throughout because there were still sporadic sales of spot flour. The inventory of various factories was depleted, and large factories were already replenishing the current month on the market. Although the factories had purchases for the current month, they sold off the far month, resulting in a situation where the near month was firm and the far month was flat. Following the fall in gold prices, hoarding buyers watched and waited. The factories continued to sell, except for the current month, which was supported by the lack of spot flour. The closing price was down 1.25 cents for September, down 1.5 cents for October, down 1.75 cents for November and December, down 1.25 cents for January, and only down 0.25 cents for the current month.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Fell Sharply with Gold Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market immediately trended downward for all months after the morning opening. The afternoon opening price fell further step by step. Because the gold price suddenly fell by 20 to 30 yuan after soaring the day before, the intention of domestic and foreign households to enter was already weak. Floating bulls and new shorts threw out positions, and external hoarding households took foreign wheat and gold prices as their guide. Although foreign wheat telecommunications rose today, gold prices suddenly fell, and exchange rates were lengthened. If there is another sharp fall, the order can be approached. The hoarding appetite is sluggish, and the market trends downward. Bulls pull back, and prices fall sharply. The closing price for August was down 5 cents, down 3 cents for October, down 4 cents for November, and down 3 cents for December. The stock of spot wheat is small, and the owners continue to shout loudly. The factory intends to buy small, resulting in a standstill in the entire city. Due to high prices in the producing areas, it is difficult to suppress them for a while.</p>
<h3>Rice Sales Were Cold Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the source of various rice varieties in this business (South Shanghai) suddenly increased slightly, with more than 20 ships arriving (a total of more than 4,000 stones). Therefore, people's hearts fell, and sales continued to be sluggish. Package purchases were still only around 400 to 500 packages from Qingdao and other dealers. The overall situation was difficult to improve, and the market color depreciated again. The prices of various thick japonica rice and thin indica rice all fell by 1 to 2 dimes. However, the price of new japonica rice in Pudong remained stable due to the continuous rainy weather and scarce goods in previous days. The prices of various colors such as Yinbian Yuan and Jianjian remained unchanged. (North Shanghai) The source was the 14th and 5th. The sales of various white japonica rice in the market were still sluggish, and the price was weak by several cents to nearly 1 dime. The sales of thin indica rice were average, and the price trend was weak. The arrival of 6 to 700 stones of Dongxin japonica rice was still not bad, and the market price was stable. The arrival and sales of white rice were balanced, and the price was stable. New guest pointed car transportation was lacking, and zero demolition continued to be sold, and the market shape was flat and fixed, the rest was slightly soft.</p>
<p>The foreign rice market was even weaker yesterday. Because Yongxian rice has been repeatedly loaded in recent days, and foreign Anhui rice has also been loaded continuously by train, although the inventory of foreign rice is small, the appetite for customers is fading day by day. Yesterday, Quanzhou and Northern dealers have stopped buying, and inland and Yong dealers slightly handle medium and inferior goods and broken rice, etc. The appetite of this street is huge, but there is new indica rice rolling feet, so the price of each rice has fallen by 1 dime and 5 to 6 cents. Although the number of Yongxian rice arrivals is small, the market is also stepping down. The total number of Xi'an 4,500 packages, Siam small twisted high tribute and other 1,800 packages, Yongxian more than 300 packages were opened to the market yesterday, and most of them were taken away by the street dealers.</p>

<h3>Court Art and Reality</h3>
<p>— Qu Yi</p>
<p>Recently, I saw a collotype edition of the Geng Zhi Tu (耕織圖, "Illustrations of Agriculture and Sericulture") from the Kangxi imperial collection. It was painted by Jiao Bingzhen, an official of the Qin Tian Jian (欽天監, Imperial Astronomical Observatory). The entire book contains twenty-three agricultural paintings and twenty-three sericultural paintings. At the beginning of the book, there is a title page by Luo Zhenyu. And a five-page preface to the Illustrations of Agriculture and Sericulture by the emperor. According to the opinion of Emperor Kangxi, who wrote the preface, he ordered the Qin Tian Jian to paint forty-six paintings for him to look at, which he also called one of his ways of governing. His preface says:</p>
<p>"I have been diligent day and night, studying governance, and thinking that the foundation of the people is food and clothing. I have often read the poems of Bin Feng and Wu Yi, which are complete with descriptions of farming and sericulture. In the past, people used them to be played on instruments and made into canonizations. Those who have the world and the country must repeatedly consider them. The edicts of the Western Han Dynasty were the closest to ancient times, and they said: 'If farming is harmed, it is the root of starvation; if women's work is harmed, it is the source of cold.' It also says, 'The elderly can end their lives with longevity, and the young orphans can grow up.' Those who want to achieve this goal must focus on the fundamentals. Every time I inspect the customs and folk songs, I happily observe agricultural affairs. I know very clearly the nature of the soil in the north and south, the suitability of planting millet and sorghum, the differences in seasons, and the methods of capturing and treating locusts. When I listen to politics, I always talk about it with the officials. On the side of Fengjin Garden, I have cultivated several fields, surrounded by streams. The fields are well-arranged, and the sound of water wheels fills my ears. Every year, I harvest thousands of bundles of good crops. I plant mulberry trees by the fields and set up silkworm sheds. The cocoons are reeled into silk, and it is as if I am next door to a thatched cottage. Therefore, I built the Zhi Jia Xuan and Qiu Yun Zhai to observe them. The ancients said, 'When wearing silk, think of the cold of the weaving girls; when eating grain, think of the suffering of the farmers.' I am deeply concerned about this. Therefore, I painted twenty-three agricultural paintings and twenty-three sericultural paintings. I wrote a poem for each painting to show the hard work, and presented them in the paintings. From the beginning to the end, the hard work of the farmers and the exhaustion of the silkworm girls are all shown in detail. I have ordered them to be engraved and circulated to let my descendants and subjects know that grain is hard to come by and clothing is not easy to get..."</p>
<p>This preface can be said to be extremely well-written. That's why I copied a large section of it. What makes us most concerned about is that he can cultivate a few acres of land, plant a few mulberry trees, build some silkworm sheds, and personally observe farming and sericulture to show his concern for agricultural affairs. However, in each of the forty-six paintings, the setting and the arrangement of the characters are extremely detailed and delicate. The twenty-three agricultural paintings are: soaking seeds, plowing, harrowing, cultivating, rolling, transplanting seedlings, first seedlings, silting, pulling seedlings, transplanting seedlings, first weeding, second weeding, third weeding, irrigating, harvesting, threshing, holding ears of grain, spring pestle, threshing, winnowing, grinding, storing, and offering sacrifices to the gods. The twenty-three sericultural paintings are: bathing silkworms, second sleep, third sleep, great rising, catching spinners, dividing the cocoon frames, picking mulberries, placing on cocoon frames, roasting cocoon frames, removing from cocoon frames, selecting cocoons, storing cocoons, reeling silk, silkworm moths, offering sacrifices, weft, weaving, winding silk, warp, dyeing, picking flowers, cutting silk, and making clothes. Although the production process of these agricultural and sericultural affairs is correct, the depiction of each painting is too beautified. The countryside is painted as a poetic realm, secluded and beautiful. Similarly, just talking about the agricultural paintings, every farmer is weak and soft, with a plump face and clear eyebrows, completely like an elegant gentleman. For example, in the painting of transplanting seedlings, two farmers each carry a basket, smiling and talking while slowly scattering the seeds in their hands like feeding chickens, as if there is infinite work pleasure. This is undoubtedly a distortion of reality. As far as I have seen, when farmers transplant seedlings, they sow with force, scattering the seeds on a field surface by field surface. There is definitely no such leisure and ease of scattering and talking. However, it is precisely because of this leisure and ease that it is suitable for the emperor's eyes. Otherwise, if the author really painted a rough and hard-working farmer scattering grain, it might make the emperor unhappy.</p>
<p>Also, such as during the third weeding and irrigation, it is the hottest weather. Most of the farmers in the countryside work shirtless. But here, everyone is still neatly dressed, and there is not a single naked person. Nakedness would naturally be offensive to the emperor's eyes. Although it is the truth, it must still be concealed. Being able to conceal it allows the emperor to be happy, to develop poetic inspiration, and to write a poem for each painting. Although the poems are extremely clumsy, the emperor's happiness is obvious. Look at the poem he wrote for the first seedling painting:</p>
<p>"Spring work is just in time, look at the schedule for planting seeds; take the time to take your children out, leaning on a cane to the road; watch the flood in West Lake, face the wind in the late afternoon; the farmer's affairs are knowable, should take countless efforts." Here, although the last sentence mentions the hard work of farming, the whole poem paints the happy situation of the farmers—and the emperor seems to share a joy in this happiness.</p>
<p>In fact, in these twenty-three agricultural paintings, there is not one that is not filled with happiness and harmonious emotion—the landlord's kindness to the farmers, the intimacy between the farmers, and the joy of the mothers and children, all feel that this day is peaceful and happy.—What a truly peaceful and happy countryside! Thus, the world is also prosperous, and the ability of art to serve as an ornament of prosperity is also exhausted.</p>
<p>But reality does not allow the author to excessively conceal the truth. Artworks should be the results of truly experiencing from real life to be great. If artworks are used as one of the services of the court and used to decorate peace, then the author's thoughts and feelings must be based on the thoughts and feelings of the master in the court. Reality is just borrowing some materials to use. Therefore, a contradiction between content and form arises. For example, here, the rough life content of the countryside is expressed as a graceful and gentle style, separating art from reality. Although the emperor is quite enlightened after seeing it, if the farmers themselves come to see it, they may suspect that this is another world and another human affair.</p>
<h3>Journey in the Gorge (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Fang Wu</p>
<p>I then told him that this was something that could not be avoided, because when walking in those mountains, if you didn't claim to be doing business, others wouldn't be willing to walk with you, and they wouldn't be happy to talk to you.</p>
<p>"Then, what exactly are you doing?"</p>
<p>"Me, my stomach is forcing me to walk, as long as I can survive, I will do it!</p>
<p>"Oh!"</p>
<p>That man then tilted his head and smiled sarcastically at my traveling companion.</p>
<p>"You've simply been deceived! ... What kind of person do you think you can deceive? Go home and watch your cow!"</p>
<p>My traveling companion sat down dejectedly on the ground, not saying a word, not answering, just puffing on his dry tobacco pipe with a creaking sound.</p>
<p>At this time, I felt that my danger had passed, and I could freely walk my way. But the man suddenly slapped his thigh and shouted at me:</p>
<p>"Good fellow, you have the ability to deceive him, then come with us: you are willing to do anything."</p>
<p>Then, suddenly remembering something, he grabbed my shoulder, shook it hard, squinted his right eye, and widened his left eye, staring at me as if he wanted to see through my lungs, and asked loudly:</p>
<p>"How did you get out? Tell me, tell me honestly! Did you injure the master's family with a hoe like him (pointing at my traveling companion)?... Tell me, you have to tell me honestly!"</p>
<p>I shook my head and said I was not like that. He raised his eyebrows, showing a thoughtful expression, and muttered to himself in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Hmm, it's a bird that still has a nest."</p>
<p>Then he showed a decisive and flexible appearance, waved his hand at me, and said humorously to me:</p>
<p>"Friend, go your way, I wish you good luck and make a fortune all the way!"</p>
<p>At this time, I breathed a sigh of relief, as if I had just emerged from the water. When I walked forward a dozen or twenty steps with my baggage, the man suddenly shouted loudly from behind:</p>
<p>"Hey, come back! Come back!"</p>
<p>I was surprised, but I had to follow him back.</p>
<p>With a worried heart for his arrangements, I walked to his front. He was already sitting cross-legged on a large stone, with a half-smoked cigarette hanging from the corner of his mouth, still showing the same leisurely and contented expression as before. He pointed his finger at the opposite side of him and said with a sarcastic smile:</p>
<p>"Don't be afraid, sit down..., you just met, now you should be old friends."</p>
<p>I couldn't help but sit down, but the baggage was still on my back.</p>
<p>"Throw away your rotten baggage! ... Hmm, it's so precious, there must be a little bit..."</p>
<p>I had to take it off, and my heart couldn't help but jump, thinking:</p>
<p>"What is this guy going to do!"</p>
<p>At the same time, I secretly glanced at the villager. He was bending over, reaching into the grass under the Forsythia, reaching out his wrist and touching something.</p>
<p>The man in front of me had already taken the cigarette from his mouth and threw it into the river, showing an impatient look, and urged me repeatedly.</p>
<p>"Hurry up, hurry up,... you are always so slow!"</p>
<p>I was a little sweaty.</p>
<p>Soon, the thing was taken out, which was a baggage. The man grabbed it and quickly opened it. The aroma of dried beef and dry wheat cakes immediately rose. While shouting "Eat", he tore a piece of dried beef and stuffed it into his mouth.</p>
<p>I hesitated. The villager squatted beside me and devoured it, as if he hadn't eaten yesterday.</p>
<p>"Eat, what are you doing stupidly? ... Are you a fool?"</p>
<p>The man stuffed a piece of beef into my hand, and when he saw that I didn't dare to accept it, he said sincerely:</p>
<p>"Aren't you hungry? Eat!"</p>
<p>My face turned red, and I stuttered:</p>
<p>"Don't... don't joke with me, I can't afford this meal."</p>
<p>"Nonsense, don't be so stupid! If you can afford it, I won't let you eat it!"</p>
<p>The man said with a slightly angry look, pulling out the tendon stuck in his teeth and throwing it into the river.</p>
<p>When he was full, the man smiled at me and said:</p>
<p>"Old friend, you can leave now! We are going too!"</p>
<p>Then he solemnly instructed:</p>
<p>"Keep walking straight, but don't look back!... You know, we mean what we say!"</p>
<p>I understood the rules of these people, words are law. Really, I walked around the hillside without looking back.</p>
<p>The sound of the river roared all the way, constantly spitting out white foam, as if a group of naughty elementary school students had been released from strict schools and were laughing madly.</p>
<p>The kingfisher quickly skimmed over the water, sometimes approaching the side of the road I was walking on, and sometimes flying far away. Wild ducks flapped their brown wings and called happily, flying up in groups of three or five, and then floating on the water in groups of three or five to chase each other.</p>
<p>The forsythia with small yellow flowers and the branches and leaves of some ash trees swayed happily in the river breeze, fluttering.</p>
<p>I took a deep breath of the fresh air in the gorge, blowing a whistle and walking happily.</p>
<h3>Lodging</h3>
<p>— Shi Dai</p>
<p>— One of the Small Scenes of Qidong Mountain Wilds —</p>
<p>The setting sun blushingly reddened its face, hiding towards the western slope of Hugou Mountain. Bathed in the light of the evening sun, the verdant mountain peaks appeared especially tranquil and lush. The densely leaved oaks soared high above the pine forest, craning their necks to gaze at the evening glow on the horizon. Their slender shadows silently massaged the pine branches. The pine branches darkened, the blurred light landing on the mound-like stone mounds, gradually fading in color.</p>
<p>From the distant valley came bursts of pastoral thunder, momentarily drowned out by the evening chanting of the monks.</p>
<p>"Let's rest a while before moving on! I'm really exhausted!"</p>
<p>"It's almost dark. Why don't we just walk to the temple halfway up the mountain and rest there? Maybe it's the Niangniang Temple?" Sister Shan pointed to the temple halfway up the mountain to the west.</p>
<p>"That's right, we can even find lodging there!"</p>
<p>Fatigue burned fiercely, and with the last remnants of our strength, we managed to round the Jiao Lv Ridge and cross a deep valley. The rugged mountain path lay prostrate beneath our feet, and we would accidentally stub our toes on a rock or stumble over a stone. Sister Xuan kept grumbling, complaining, "Why didn't we hire mules to ride in Shiliu Chuang?" But Sister Shan and I endured in silence.</p>
<p>By the time we reached the stone base in front of the temple to sit down, dusk was already drawing in its faint shadows. I ran to the front of the temple and looked up at the red lacquered plaque with golden characters. It really was the "Niangniang Temple." Joy bloomed like a night-blooming cereus, its petals bursting open all at once. I shouted from afar:</p>
<p>"It really is the Niangniang Temple!"</p>
<p>As if fatigue feared joy, my legs felt as light as chicken feathers, and I ran to the stone base like a gust of wind. I patted Sister Xuan on the shoulder:</p>
<p>"We don't have to worry about finding a place to stay."</p>
<p>I was about to knock on the temple door, but Sister Shan said not to rush. "Let's rest first before calling at the door. Anyway, the nun won't refuse us lodging after she sees Third Aunt's letter!" We rested with single-minded determination. Sister Xuan emptied the sand from her shoes, while I was drawn to a small red notice on the stone base. I leaned closer to take a closer look. It read:</p>
<p>"Oh Heavenly Emperor, Oh Earthly Emperor, my family has a crying night lad,</p>
<p>Travelers, gentlemen, recite three times, sleep soundly until dawn."</p>
<p>Night concealed dusk, and the summer heat also plunged into the dark trap along with the mountains. The murmuring stream at the bottom of the Stone Woman River, like a widow's midnight sighs, sliced through the silence of the air and drifted into the valley. Grasshoppers clicked their wings busily in the deep grass, as if deliberately scaring us girls on an adventurous journey.</p>
<p>"A-Dai! Go call at the door!"</p>
<p>The three sisters walked to the temple steps together. I used Sister Xuan's walking stick to knock on the door. The dog inside barked madly and ran over, its paws scratching at the threshold as it bit fiercely. Then someone scolded the dog. The roaring dog stopped barking, and the door opened to reveal a nun in a black robe. Her glowing face wore a look of surprise, her eyes sharply sizing up the three of us sisters.</p>
<p>"Master! Is there a Master Yi here?"</p>
<p>"Ah! Ah..."</p>
<p>She hesitated, clearly suspicious of our origins.</p>
<p>Seeing her like that, I couldn't help but lose my temper:</p>
<p>"We're not bandits or thieves, don't worry. The three of us sisters are from Jiangnan, and we're all students. Please tell us, is Master Yi here or not? If you don't believe us, we have a letter of introduction!"</p>
<p>Why do straightforward people always have to be so blunt? Sister tried to signal me with her eyes, not letting me say anything further.</p>
<p>The old nun finally nodded and let us in.</p>
<p>Darkness enveloped the temple courtyard. Everything was blurry. The dog, with its shining eyes, was barking in the corner. The meditation room was quiet, the faint light of the lamp flickering dimly. The bodhisattva paintings on the wall were almost forgotten by the light.</p>
<p>Sister Xuan opened her leather bag and handed Third Aunt's handwritten letter to the old nun. As soon as she saw the handwriting and signature on the envelope, she knew it was a letter from her old friend Shi Keyun, whom she had known for twenty years. While tearing open the letter, she said to us with a smile:</p>
<p>"I am Jingyi. How is Sister Keyun doing?"</p>
<p>"Thanks to the Master's blessing, Third Aunt is safe and well."</p>
<p>After reading Third Aunt's letter, she entertained us with a smiling face. She went into the inner room and woke up a sleeping little nun, instructing her to start a fire, boil water, and cook rice.</p>
<p>Even though fatigue was fermenting in our bodies, it was impossible to lie down and rest. Master Yi asked us many questions, and the three sisters had to answer them carefully. When we spoke about Third Aunt's life story, she sighed about her own past. Becoming a nun was not her wish. She was not a pessimist, nor was she escaping reality. It was merely a temporary way to settle down. Although she was now the abbess of the Niangniang Temple, this kind of lonely life did not arouse her interest at all.</p>
<p>By the time we finished eating, the night was even quieter. The mountain gate was locked tightly, and the waterfall in the distant mountain stream crashed against the stream, urging us to sleep early. When we lay down at the time, Master Yi was still hunched over the lamp reading the letter we brought.</p>
<h3>The Tragedy by the Sea (5)</h3>
<p>— Original by French Balzac, translated by Wang Jiansheng</p>
<p>"You know, I will always remember all this, and Chabrame will naturally remember it too," he said after a pause.</p>
<p>"When Jaques Chabrame was fifteen or sixteen years old, he was already a complete little swindler. He often went out to fool people, and waited in the areas of Gironde and Saffran. Then he needed money, so he went to steal from his mother, who didn't dare to utter a word in front of her husband. Labrame was an honest man, and if someone wrote two extra 'sous' on a check, he would have to travel twenty miles to return the money in full."</p>
<p>"Finally, one day when his father was out fishing, his mother was robbed of all her possessions. Their son took the dressing table, pottery, bed sheets, shirts, leaving her nothing but the bare walls. After selling everything he had swept away, he went alone to Nantes to drink. The poor woman cried day and night over this. When his father returned, she wanted to tell him, but she feared the child's father—not for herself—you understand! When Pierre Chabrame returned, he saw his wife's borrowed furniture and said, 'What's going on?' His poor wife was barely alive. Finally, she said, 'We have been robbed!' 'Where did Jaques go?' 'Jaques went drinking alone!' No one knew where this worthless treasure had fled to. 'He really likes to be dissolute!' Pierre said.</p>
<p>"Six months later, the poor father heard that his son was going to be brought to Nantes for trial. He walked there (walking was closer than going by sea) found his son, and brought him back. He didn't ask him, 'What crimes have you committed?' He simply said, 'If you can't live with your mother and me for two years, behave properly, go out fishing for a living, and be an honest man, you'll see what I'll do!' This madman thought his parents were stupid and mocked his father. So Pierre struck him hard on the head, causing Jaques to lie down for six months, while the poor mother withered away with grief.</p>
<p>'One night, as she lay sleeping beside her husband, she heard a clamor. She got out of bed and was stabbed in the arm. She cried out, and they lit a fire. Pierre Chabrame knew his wife was injured. He was convinced it was a robber—as if there really were robbers in this place. Ah, you could carry ten thousand francs with you from Croisic to Saint-Nazaire without worrying about anyone asking you what you were carrying. Pierre went to look for Jaques, but he couldn't find him anywhere. The next morning, the little robber brazenly returned, saying he was living in Batteuse. I should tell you that his mother didn't know where to deposit her money. Chabrame deposited his money with Mr. Le Peule at Croisic. Their son's mischief cost them many pounds, and they were already half ruined, because it was difficult for a person with twelve thousand livres (French silver coins) to spend freely. No one knew how much money Chabrame spent in Nantes to redeem his son. The whole family was trapped in an evil fate. Chabrame's brother also suffered misfortune and sought help. To comfort him, Pierre told him that Jaques should marry Pierrot (Pierrot was Chabrame's brother's daughter) and thus help him make a living. He hired him when he was fishing. Joseph Chabrame also had to work hard for the sake of bread. His wife had died of fever, so she had to pay Pierrot several months' wages for weaning. Pierre Chabrame's wife owed more than a hundred francs to people for soothing the child and for his clothes, and she also owed Dafroux two or three months' wages for bringing milk for Pierrot. Dafroux had a child with Sigodel. Chabrame's wife sewed a Spanish gold coin into the wool of her bedding with the inscription "For Pierrot." He had received a good education. Her handwriting was as neat as a clerk's. She had taught her son to read, and it was this that ruined her family. No one knew about this, but everyone knew that the worthless Jaques had stolen the gold and taken it to Croisic to squander."</p>

<h3>Administrative Yuan's Order to Government and Military Organs to Pay Telegraph and Telephone Fees</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Recently, the Administrative Yuan noted that government, military, and police organs often delayed paying telegraph and telephone fees. When new administrations took over from old ones, new officials often made excuses and refused to pay the outstanding fees from the previous administration's tenure. As a result, telegraph revenue has been steadily decreasing. The Yuan has therefore issued a special order to all ministries, commissions, provincial and municipal governments, and their affiliated organs, stating that all telegraph and telephone fees must be paid monthly. In cases of changeover, outgoing and incoming officials must not make excuses and pass the buck. Otherwise, telegraph and telephone services will be suspended in accordance with the regulations of the telegraph and telephone bureaus. This is the most effective order issued by the Administrative Yuan at the request of the Ministry of Communications to rectify outstanding telegraph and telephone fees.</p>
<p>Telegraph communications are a state-run enterprise. Government and military organs are state organs, and their personnel are public servants. It is beyond doubt that they should pay all telegraph and telephone fees in accordance with the regulations, without the need for repeated government announcements. However, since the outbreak of military conflicts, and because politics has not been on the right track, government and military organs have been sending excessive telegrams and installing excessive telephones, to the point that they cannot pay off their debts. Because the Ministry of Communications cannot recover the fees they owe each year, various improvement and reorganization plans cannot be implemented. The economic losses to the Ministry of Communications are already considerable, but the moral losses are even more regrettable because government and military organs do not send telegrams or install telephones in accordance with the regulations, pay all fees, and then fail to comply with government orders to make monthly payments.</p>
<p>We deeply understand that the state has faced many crises in recent years, and expenditures have been enormous, so government and military organs may not have sufficient funds. However, if we examine the budgets and final accounts of government and military organs, we can see that monthly postal and telegraph fees are clearly listed. If these postal and telegraph fees can be paid monthly, the telegraph authorities will welcome it. If these fixed fees are begrudged and not paid, it seems that the claim of insufficient funds cannot be considered a reasonable excuse for government and military organs.</p>
<p>An examination of the telegrams sent by government and military organs reveals that many of them are indeed urgent, but many are also ordinary matters. Even among urgent telegrams, some are deliberately ostentatious, and some are unnecessarily lengthy. This is what is meant by sending excessive telegrams. After sending excessive telegrams, the telegraph fees will inevitably be delayed, and after being delayed, they will be difficult to pay off. If government and military organs can comply with Commander-in-Chief Chiang's telegram of December 1932, which stated that "unless absolutely necessary to save money, telegrams must not exceed one hundred characters, unless an especially urgent matter, the words 'immediate arrival' must not be used indiscriminately, and unless an emergency, express mail should be used instead of sending a telegram whenever possible," there will be no excessive telegrams, telegraph fees can be paid, and there will be no accumulation of debts as large as they are today.</p>
<p>The changeover of government and military organs is an internal matter and has nothing to do with the telegraph bureau. Why should they make excuses and refuse to pay the outstanding telegraph and telephone fees of the previous administration? If government and military organs owe money to other organs or stores, can they make such excuses? And if other organs or stores owe money to government and military organs, can they make such excuses? Knowing full well that they cannot make such excuses, but still refusing to pay telegraph and telephone fees, is because government and military organs are accustomed to old habits and neglect government orders, and because the telegraph authorities are intimidated by power and neglect their duties, failing to collect the outstanding telegraph and telephone fees from the government and military organs on a monthly basis is also a major reason.</p>
<p>Now that the most effective order of the Executive Yuan has been issued, if government and military organs fail to pay their telegraph and telephone fees on a monthly basis, the telegraph authorities can, based on this order, suspend telegraph and telephone services. At the same time, they can report to the Ministry of Communications and then to the Executive Yuan for the legal punishment of the head of the organ. Whether the telegraph authority's finances can be rectified depends on whether government and military organs respect this order.</p>
<h3>The Truth About the Dispute Between Wuhu Rice Merchants and the Telegraph Bureau</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Recently, the China Daily in Nanjing and the Wanjiang and Industrial and Commercial Daily in Wuhu published news about "the Wuhu Telegraph Bureau delaying the delivery of telegrams, being sued by local rice merchants in court, and being required to compensate for losses." The case is as follows: Starting last year, the Anhui Provincial Government levied a rice surtax on rice grains leaving the province. Surtax collection offices were established in various regions of Anhui to be responsible for this task. Later, the office received a telegram order from the Provincial Government to stop the collection and set a deadline to close down. However, because the telegram to stop the collection was delayed by several hours by the Wuhu Telegraph Bureau, several rice merchants paid more than 400 piculs of rice surtax, and their requests for the office to return it were unsuccessful. Therefore, the rice merchants believed that the losses they suffered were entirely due to the delayed delivery of the telegram. They specially jointly hired lawyers to sue the director of the Telegraph Bureau in the Wuhu District Court for negligence and demanded compensation. The reporter feels that whether the losses of the Wuhu rice merchants were entirely due to the delayed delivery of the telegram is, of course, still open to question, but the delayed delivery of the telegram to stop the collection is the main reason for the occurrence of this case, so it is certainly necessary to first examine the necessity. Especially in the midst of the active rectification of the telegraph business, the above unfortunate incident occurred, and it is even more necessary to thoroughly investigate the cause and share it with the community. Now, I will write down the reasons for the delay that the reporter inquired about, hoping that readers of this publication will give fair advice.</p>
<p>Originally, each telegram's receiving place name should only be one place, according to regulations. If there are two receiving place names, then there are two telegrams, and two telegraph fees must be paid. The reason is simple, because a telegram sent to two places requires two sets of labor and materials, and the situation is exactly the same as that of two telegrams with different texts. However, some military and government telegrams often are not subject to this restriction. Each telegram often has several or even a dozen receiving place names. Under special circumstances, the Telegraph Bureau certainly cannot refuse. Unfortunately, the Anhui Provincial Government's telegram to stop the collection of rice surtax was delayed because of the confusion caused by multiple receiving place names. The receiving place name of the telegram of the Wan Provincial Government to stop the collection of rice surtax was written like this: "Wuhu Nanjing Shangxinhe send to Xiliangshan Chuxian send to Chenjiaqian Guangde send to Dingbu Mingguang send to Xuyi Surtax Collection Office." At that time, the Wuhu Telegraph Bureau believed that there was no recipient's name, address, or other identifier between the place names Wuhu and Nanjing, and it was thought that it was "Wuhu Nanjing Shangxinhe sent to Xiliangshan." Because Wuhu is only more than 30 li from Xiliangshan, and Nanjing Shangxinhe is 120 or 130 li from Xiliangshan, and telegrams sent to Xiliangshan have always been sent exclusively by the Wuhu Bureau, it was undoubtedly assigned to a special delivery to Xiliangshan. Later, after the Wuhu Bureau's review staff's research results, they felt that Wuhu itself might also be copying the telegram, so the telegram was re-extracted and sent. But it had been delayed for several hours. That is the reason for the so-called delay.</p>
<p>The reporter expresses his sincere sympathy for the Wuhu rice merchants' major investment loss this time, but is this loss really due to the delayed delivery of the telegram? The content of the Anhui Provincial Government's telegram to stop the collection of rice surtax is, of course, impossible for outsiders to guess, but according to common sense, there must be a clearly specified deadline. It will never say, "Stop collecting from the time the telegram arrives." Moreover, the place to collect rice surtax is not just Wuhu, and of course it will be treated the same as other places in the province. Wuhu must not be allowed to suffer losses alone. This is what I want to ask the Wuhu rice merchants to recognize clearly, otherwise it will be a waste of effort.</p>
<p>I heard that the Ministry of Communications believes that the Wuhu Bureau's delayed telegram delivery, although there are the reasons described above, is still due to the negligence of the office staff. The responsible personnel have been given appropriate punishment and are trying to avoid the occurrence of the same incident. As for whether the Wuhu rice merchants' lawsuit against the Telegraph Bureau is legal and whether the Telegraph Bureau should be held liable for compensation, the court will, of course, handle it impartially based on the Telegraph Regulations of the Ministry of Communications, so there is no need for the reporter to say more!</p>
<h3>Notice to Those Who Set Up Academic Experimental Radio Stations</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Communications published announcements in Ping, Lu, Hu, and Han and other places, offering rewards for secretly reporting privately established radio stations, confidential letters have been pouring in, and the number of privately established radio stations that have been detected and seized is not small. However, among them, after investigation, some of the main purposes of setting up stations are purely for experimental research purposes, which are naturally different from ordinary privately established radio stations for secret communication, and cannot be generalized.</p>
<p>The establishment of radio stations by public or private organizations or individuals for academic research purposes is permitted by Article 3, Section 6 of the Telecommunications Regulations. The communications authorities even promulgated the Regulations for the Establishment of Academic Experimental Wireless Radio Stations in July of last year. At that time, the regulations were also consulted by various relevant agencies and groups for reference. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications' supervision and encouragement of the establishment of academic experimental wireless radio stations (hereinafter referred to as experimental radio stations) cannot be denied. However, since the implementation of these regulations, a year has passed in a blink of an eye. Many experimental radio stations in various places have complied with the regulations and applied for registration, but many are still waiting to see. The communications authorities are not responsible for guaranteeing the safety of these unregistered experimental radio stations. Once someone reports them and it is confirmed, in order to maintain the authority of the law, they will inevitably be banned and brought to justice. It is hoped that those who set up experimental radio stations will quickly register and obtain licenses in accordance with the regulations, and no longer hesitate and linger, so as to avoid falling into the legal net, so that they can concentrate on wireless radio research and experimentation.</p>
<p>The Regulations for the Establishment of Academic Experimental Wireless Radio Stations have 26 articles, which are quite complete. Now, the contents are summarized as follows, for reference by relevant parties:</p>
<p>(A) A radio station that aims to study wireless telecommunications academics and is dedicated to experimentation and testing is called an academic wireless radio station. This type of radio station can be established by national universities and colleges, specialized science and engineering schools and science and engineering societies legally registered with the education authorities of the National Government, and citizens of the Republic of China who are engaged in wireless telecommunications research and improvement and can make practical contributions, after applying for and being approved by the Ministry of Communications. When applying, the following items should be opened in detail: (1) Name, resume, and address of the person in charge and the person in charge of the experiment; (If there is any change in this personnel, it should be reported to the Ministry of Communications at any time.) (2) The registration authority of private schools or societies, and the year and month of registration; (3) The name, address, organization, estimate, and source of the radio station, the machine program, and the engineering plan.</p>
<p>(B) The transmission power of the transmitter of the experimental radio station shall not exceed 50 watts for personal installations; for installations by societies or national and private specialized schools, the maximum shall not exceed 100 watts. The frequency of the radio waves used by the telecommunications machine shall be limited to the following, and should be kept stable as much as possible so that the difference from the original frequency does not exceed two per thousand, and the occurrence of multiple waves must be avoided:</p>
<p>(1) 56,000-60,000 kHz (wavelength 5.35-5 meters)</p>
<p>(2) 28,000-30,000 kHz (wavelength 10.7-10 meters)</p>
<p>(3) 14,000-14,400 kHz (wavelength 21.4-20 meters)</p>
<p>(4) 7,000-7,300 kHz (wavelength 42.8-41 meters)</p>
<p>(5) 3,500-4,000 kHz (wavelength 85-75 meters)</p>
<p>(6) 1,715-2,000 kHz (wavelength 175-150 meters)</p>
<p>(C) The experimental radio station should be installed within six months after being approved for establishment, and the machine program, detailed wiring diagram, transmission power, maximum antenna current and its height, radio wave method and its frequency, communication method and the address, call sign, wave and power of its communication radio station, and the daily transmission time, etc. should be submitted to the Ministry of Communications for inspection, issuance of a license, and designation of a call sign. The above items shall not be changed by themselves after being stipulated or approved by the Ministry of Communications.</p>
<p>(D) The experimental radio station shall not be used for any other communication or broadcasting purposes other than for academic experimental purposes; it shall not disturb or interfere with the communication of the land, sea, and air forces, and the business of state-run or public communication organs; it shall not intercept the communication of other radio stations. If it is accidentally acquired, it must be kept absolutely confidential, but this restriction does not apply in the event of a distress call.</p>
<p>(E) When the experimental radio station communicates with other radio stations, it should fill in the form for the academic experimental radio station communication record in detail according to the format stipulated by the Ministry of Communications, and send it to the Ministry of Communications for inspection every quarter. The results of peacetime experiments must be summarized and reported at the end of May and November each year.</p>
<p>(F) The Ministry of Communications may send personnel to inspect the machine parts, licenses, and various related books and charts of the radio station at any time, and the radio station shall not refuse on any pretext. If any violation of the rules is found, the experiment may be suspended or the license revoked for a period of time depending on the severity of the circumstances, and the provisions of Article 21 of the Telecommunications Regulations may be followed.</p>
<p>The above six items are a brief description of the content of the regulations. Readers who want to see the whole picture can directly write to the Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Communications in Nanjing or to this newspaper to request a copy, which will be sent immediately.</p>
<h3>Advantages of the Newly Revised Public Telegram Fee Payment Method (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Baozhen</p>
<p>(4) After a sender has dispatched a telegram, should they discover that essential information has been omitted from the message, or that a character has been transcribed incorrectly, or mistranslated, or if they receive a paid public telegram from the receiving telegraph office inquiring about a doubtful character in the telegram, and after investigation, it is confirmed to be their own error, they may request the telegraph office to send a paid public telegram to notify the receiving telegraph office to supplement the message or correct the erroneous character. The fee for this type of paid public telegram is only charged according to the number of characters requested by the applicant. For example, if supplementing two characters for an address or the text of the message, only the fee for two characters needs to be paid; if correcting one character in the message, only the fee for one character needs to be paid. Compared to the previous practice where the sender had to pay for all the characters contained in the entire telegram, this can also reduce a portion of the telegraph fee.</p>
<p>(5) If a sender is unsure whether a telegram they have sent has been delivered successfully and has doubts, they can go to the telegraph office and request that a paid public telegram be sent on their behalf to inquire about the original telegram, asking on what date and time it was delivered. The fee for sending this public telegram is waived; only the return telegraph fee for six characters needs to be prepaid, and then they can receive a return telegram from the receiving telegraph office indicating the date and time of delivery. Prior to the implementation of the new method, the fee for this type of paid public telegram had to be paid by the sender according to the number of characters contained in the original telegram, and the return telegraph fee also had to be prepaid. Now, only a return telegraph fee for six characters needs to be paid, which is also a benefit for senders.</p>
<p>(6) Senders generally eagerly await a reply from the recipient after sending a telegram. If the receiving party neglects to reply, it is bound to cause anxiety. However, if the sender wants to send another telegram to urge the other party to reply, they would have to pay another telegraph fee, which feels too uneconomical. The new standardized fee payment method for public telegrams now includes a type of paid public telegram that says, "Sender requests that the receiving party be notified to send a reply telegram promptly." If a sender is urgently awaiting a reply to a telegram they sent, but has not received a reply promptly, they can request the telegraph office to send a paid public telegram to the receiving telegraph office to urge the recipient to reply. Upon receiving the public telegram urging a reply, the receiving party will naturally not be able to delay the reply any further. Moreover, the fee for this public telegram is only one character's worth, which saves a considerable amount compared to sending a telegram to urge a reply themselves. This is indeed one of the advantages of the newly revised fee payment method for public telegrams.</p>
<p>(7) Suppose a business in Qingdao has just sent a telegram to a foreign firm or manufacturer in Shanghai ordering a batch of goods. Subsequently, they hear reliable news in the market that the price of these goods is showing a continuous and sharp downward trend. If they were to order based on the current market price, they would inevitably suffer an unexpected loss when the goods arrive. To remedy this, the only option is to stop the telegram that has already been sent. If a sender encounters the above situation, they do not need to send another telegram directly to the receiving party to make a statement. Instead, they can entrust the telegraph office to send a paid public telegram to notify the receiving telegraph office to cancel the telegram. The telegraph office only charges the fee for one character for this type of public telegram, which can be considered extremely low and provides great convenience to the sender. Furthermore, if the sender requires the receiving telegraph office to reply with confirmation that the original telegram has been cancelled, they can also do so, but they must prepay the return telegraph fee for six characters so that the receiving telegraph office can reply to the sending telegraph office after cancelling the original telegram. The cost to the sending party is only these six characters' worth of return telegraph fee, and since the telegram they sent has already been confirmed by the receiving telegraph office as having been cancelled, unexpected disputes can be avoided.</p>
<p>(8) Suppose a telegram is sent to Qingyuan, and the telegraph office notifies that the telegram cannot be delivered because the recipient has gone to Beijing. If the sender knows the recipient's address in Beijing and is willing to bear the forwarding fee for the original telegram, they can ask the telegraph office to send a paid public telegram to notify the Qingyuan telegraph office to forward the telegram to Beijing. Regardless of the number of characters, this public telegram only requires the fee for six characters, which is also quite inexpensive.</p>
<p>Based on the above points, the promulgation of the standardized fee payment method for public telegrams undoubtedly provides great convenience for both senders and recipients. From now on, if senders or recipients want to inquire with the other party's telegraph office about any matter related to a telegram they have received or sent, or to notify the other party's telegraph office, they can utilize paid public telegrams instead of sending telegrams themselves, thus avoiding unnecessary telegraph fees. Furthermore, this newly revised method applies equally to both domestic and international telegrams. Once senders and recipients understand how to use paid public telegrams, they will save even more on international telegrams. From this, it can be seen that the Telegraph Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications has recently made all arrangements for telegraph services with the aim of facilitating the public and strives to provide thorough service.</p>
<h3>Recent Rectification of Broadcasting Stations by the Ministry of Communications</h3>
<p>— Yuzhou</p>
<p>In recent years, the number of broadcasting stations in various parts of our country has been increasing, and the number of people using radios is even greater. In bustling city thoroughfares, one cannot escape the noisy songs, and even in the countryside near cities, bamboo poles are often seen erected, each with a radio antenna. The Ministry of Communications believes that the broadcasting industry is of great importance to a nation's politics and culture. Furthermore, in our country, where public intelligence is undeveloped and only a small number of ordinary people have the ability to read and newspapers, the promotion of social education, the dissemination of common knowledge, and the transmission of important news all rely on the assistance of broadcasting stations. In order to achieve proper effects and avoid unexpected drawbacks, it attaches great importance to broadcasting stations. Previously, because our country's broadcasting industry was still in its infancy, a certain degree of leniency had to be granted for the sake of promotion. Now that the situation is different, strict principles should be adopted for rectification. The recent rectification situation is described in detail below, which is likely to be welcome news for those who are concerned about the broadcasting industry.</p>
<p>(1) Suspension of Issuing Permits. The Ministry of Communications stipulates that the frequencies used for broadcasting stations are from 550 kHz to 1500 kHz, and the difference between each frequency should be 10 kHz. Therefore, in fact, a total of more than 90 stations can be established. Now, the Ministry of Communications believes that these frequencies have been fully allocated, and the established stations are in need of consolidation. Therefore, last month, it stipulated that the issuance of permits for privately-operated broadcasting stations should be uniformly suspended, and this was published in major newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai, which readers are presumably aware of. However, what we should still pay attention to is that the purpose of this suspension of issuing permits by the Ministry of Communications is purely to rectify broadcasting stations, and it should not be mistaken as an unwarranted restriction on privately-operated telecommunications businesses. The reason is that since the wavelengths have already been fully allocated, if more stations continue to be established, interference will inevitably occur, and even the established broadcasting stations will experience difficulties in broadcasting.</p>
<p>(2) Banning Poorly Managed Stations. After a broadcasting station is approved for establishment, the Ministry of Communications still conducts strict inspections at any time. Regarding equipment, it appoints specialists to go to each station for on-site inspections. Regarding programs, the International Telecommunications Bureau and the Tianjin Telegraph Bureau pay attention to listening in the South China and North China regions, respectively. Those who are poorly managed are punished accordingly, and those with serious circumstances are banned. Recently, more than ten stations have been banned. Some were banned because they failed to establish the station within the time limit after being approved. Others were banned because of faulty equipment and repeated orders to improve it were not followed. Still others were banned for broadcasting obscene and lewd songs and failing to comply with orders to be punished. Others were banned for privately transferring or subletting the station. All of these items are clearly stipulated in the "Provisional Regulations for Banning Privately-Operated Wireless Broadcasting Stations" promulgated by the Ministry of Communications, and broadcasting stations that violate regulations and disobey guidance are subject to banning, which is their own fault.</p>
<p>(3) Rectifying the Broadcasting Programs of Each Station. The Ministry of Communications has already made principled regulations regarding the broadcasting programs of each station in the "Provisional Regulations for Banning Privately-Operated Wireless Broadcasting Stations." However, the stations often neglect this. Recently, the Ministry of Communications issued a notice to all stations, stating that on the negative side, they must not cater to the low-level interests of all sectors of society and must not broadcast obscene and lewd songs that harm public morals. On the positive side, for the sake of promoting Party principles, raising the level of people's knowledge, and inspiring national spirit, they should allocate a considerable amount of time each day to broadcast Party principles, short biographies of national heroes of past dynasties, common knowledge of citizenship, international common knowledge, and the good morals inherent in our country, etc. All reports should be mainly in Mandarin. At the same time, each station was ordered to submit a copy of its current broadcasting schedule, and any subsequent changes should be reported five days in advance for the convenience of verification. In addition, one more thing is worth reporting. The Ministry of Communications plans to conduct a thorough study after collecting the broadcasting schedules of each station, and make specific regulations regarding the programs that general broadcasting stations should have and the allocation of time for them, so that each station has something to comply with. The quality of broadcasting programs is directly related to the actual effectiveness of broadcasting stations, so it is necessary to rectify them seriously.</p>
<p>In summary, the Ministry of Communications' hard work in rectifying broadcasting stations is clearly evident. However, there is something we must say. Our country's broadcasting industry is disorganized, and in the past, due to the relationship between local jurisdictions, it was difficult to manage, resulting in a rather chaotic situation, and there were many complaints in society. Now, through the Ministry of Communications' efforts to rectify it, it has gradually become more standardized, and if it can continue to move forward in this way, the future is promising. It is deeply hoped that Party and government agencies will direct their self-established broadcasting stations to be subject to the command of the Ministry of Communications in accordance with the law, so that the effect of overall planning can be achieved, and that all privately-operated broadcasting stations should recognize the importance of their responsibilities, which are different from running ordinary businesses, and must strive to improve themselves within the scope of laws and regulations.</p>
<h3>A Noteworthy Ten Million Yuan</h3>
<p>— You</p>
<p>The amount of international telegraph fees saved for the public after the opening of international wireless communications.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the International Telegraph Administration in 1929, the rates for telegrams between our country and various parts of the world have been reduced through repeated negotiations. By the end of March of this year, the public had saved nearly ten million yuan in telegraph fees as a result. The detailed figures are listed in the table below:</p>
<p>Those who pay attention to telegram matters may sometimes question the savings in telegraph fees due to the increase in the silver dollar price of international telegrams. It is noted that this increase is determined in accordance with international telecommunications regulations based on changes in the exchange rate of the gold franc. When the exchange rate fluctuates, the silver dollar price must inevitably increase or decrease accordingly. However, regardless of whether this silver dollar price increases or decreases, if the standard gold franc price (see item 1 in the table) has never been reduced (item 2 in the table is the reduced price), then all sectors of society would have added a burden of ten million yuan to international wireless telegraph fees. The so-called savings in telegraph fees refers to this. As for why the communications authorities negotiate with all parties to reduce prices, it is because the telecommunications industry serves the public and cannot have profit as its sole purpose. Therefore, even in the midst of extreme difficulties in the telecommunications economy, it still reduces prices as much as possible to lighten the public's burden, which is worthy of praise by the people of the country.</p>
<h3>Recent Trends in the Development of World Telecommunications Technology</h3>
<p>— Wang Dachun</p>
<p>In recent years, the telecommunications industry in various countries around the world has seen remarkable technological developments. In particular, since last year—1934 in the Western calendar—there has been significant progress in telecommunications technology, making telecommunications transmission more efficient and rapid. All the communication methods that telecommunications engineers once considered to be only in the realm of ideals have now gradually reached the point of practical application. In short, the communication methods of the telecommunications industry in various countries, whether in wired or wireless communications, are tending to use higher frequencies. Now, when we try to study the various communication methods recently adopted by various countries, what is most noteworthy is that the communication channels within various communication methods often contain broad bands of frequency. For example, the multi-channel telephone system used in European countries last year had broad bands of frequency available for application because its circuit was equipped with newly designed feed-back amplifiers and crystal filterer, which resulted in excellent performance in communication. There have been many such technological developments to date, and although the results are different, they have all achieved satisfactory success.</p>
<p>Now, let us first describe the more important progress of the telecommunications technology of various countries in the past year. Among them, the use of the carrier telephone system on overhead lines is more well-known because it uses broad bands of frequency to create supplementary communication channels, and the width of the frequency bands can also be used to transmit the broadcasting programs of broadcasting stations. This method was put into practical use between Bratislava and Cosice in Czechoslovakia in August of last year, that is, adding a high communication channel to the original three communication channels, and the bandwidth of the high communication channel was 7,500 cycles.</p>
<p>Adding a large number of communication channels to the original telecommunications circuit is a more meaningful event in the development of telecommunications technology in the past year. The method is to add ten voice frequency telegraphs to each of the original standard three-communication channel carrier methods in the telegraph machine circuit. In this way, together with the original telephone communication channels, up to 54 two-way telegraph communication channels will be added on one circuit of overhead lines. This installation method has been implemented in Cape Town and lohannesburg in South Africa, and the distance between the two ends can reach 1,000 miles.</p>
<p>Telecommunications circuits, telephone repeaters, and Loading Coils, etc., all of the latest designs can provide more than one telephone circuit for use. Therefore, the ingenuity of the new design is that a carrier circuit can often be added to each ordinary telephone circuit, and its frequency band can be used from 3,500 cycles to 7,000 cycles. The newly installed cables between London and Glasgow are designed according to this, and the amount of communication can be greatly increased in practice. From this, it can be seen that it is no longer difficult to add a single-channel carrier channel to an ordinary telephone circuit. Now, we are further studying the use of high-speed carrier communication channels of more than three channels in extremely long-distance circuits, and the realization of this is expected to be not far away. Recently, a submarine cable was newly designed and manufactured between Australia and Tasmania Island, and its communication channels are numerous. The total width of all frequency bands is planned to use 42,500 cycles. The mechanical equipment at both ends is also specially designed so that each single line can bear three two-way telephone communication channels with a frequency band of 9,000 cycles; three one-way telephone communication channels with a frequency band of 11,000 to 20,000 cycles; three reply communication channels with a frequency band of 21,000 to 31,000 cycles: In addition, there is one replaceable broadcast communication channel with a frequency level of 34,000 to 42,500 cycles.</p>
<p>As for land cables, in 1933, the city of Morristown, New Jersey, USA, conducted several experiments that were of great significance: the method was to connect each pair of underground cable core wires 25 miles long to each other at the front and rear ends. In this way, the core wires were hypothetically made into a line circuit 850 miles long. Using a frequency rate of 4 to 40 kilo cycles (KC), nine carrier telephone communication channels can be obtained. The application of coaxial lines for communication methods (a coaxial line is a hollow circular conductor tube with a thinner wire placed in the tube, and its function is that it can transmit telegrams, telephones, or television symbols in a very wide frequency level) can transmit even wider frequency bands. Various countries are currently studying it, and the results of the experiments can be used to effectively and smoothly transmit frequency bands with a width of more than 1,000 kilo cycles. If appropriate equipment is used, this frequency level can be divided into 200 one-way telephone communication channels. However, on coaxial lines, the amount of communication attenuation will increase with the widening of the frequency level, and the distance between the machines in the circuit must be shortened. Therefore, the shortening of the distance can reduce the number of repeaters used at the intermediate stations. In the circuit using coaxial lines, each repeater at the intermediate station only needs two pieces, and the number has been reduced, making technical management easier. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Marrying Eighty Wives in Five Years</h3>
<p>— Si</p>
<p>A国民社 report from Belgrade on the 11th stated that Mania, who married a total of eighty wives in five years, has been arrested in the Romanian capital. Mania is only 28 years old. It is said that he spent US$200,000 to marry eighty wives, but after marriage, he would defraud the women of money and then abandon them. This is truly a scandalous case worth noting.</p>
<p>I carefully considered it for him. Marrying eighty wives in five years, averaging almost one bride every twenty days. His means of seducing the opposite sex are so brilliant that they are truly shocking to modern people. However, according to his claims, he would defraud the girls of money immediately after marriage and then abandon them. He spent US$200,000 to marry eighty wives. Then it is clear that he used marriage as a means and defrauding money as the purpose. He married eighty women and spent as much as US$200,000. Then those women who were deceived by him must have spent twice as much as he did. It can be asserted that this is truly the number one gigolo.</p>
<p>Mania's character, although the telegram is brief and does not explain it, but judging from the greatness of his magic to attract women, he must be a young and handsome gigolo. But rather than saying that Mania's means of stealing jade are brilliant, it is better to say that the intellectual level of these women is weak. If a woman marries someone, how can she not consider the opponent's personality, character, knowledge, background, and commit herself to marriage at first sight? Their stupidity is truly immeasurable.</p>
<p>Bigamy is a crime. Not only does our country have some regulations, but the laws of other countries are also like this. Now, Mania has committed seventy or eighty counts of bigamy. I don't know how the judge will rule on the case. I am afraid that there are no such provisions in the law, and there are no such precedents in fact. The judge trying the case is also a difficult problem. Our country is known as the place where gigolos are produced. Although they have played many romantic and tragic histories in society, if compared with Mr. Mania's case, they are really just a drop in the bucket.</p>
<p>Since Adam and Eve committed a catastrophic disaster, the world has added a lot of romantic grievances between foolish men and women. Some women are fooled by men, and some men are fooled by women. It is difficult to separate and resolve, and it is impossible to clear up. This is originally a mystery of the universe. If someone can break this mystery, society will definitely be much cleaner. Now women, although liberated, there is always an obstacle between men and women. Assuming that men and women can be completely liberated and the mystery of the universe can be completely broken, this kind of disaster will not occur.</p>
<p>But now some people are promoting the idea of separate schools for men and women, etc. On the surface, it seems brighter, but in fact, it is more corrupt. Because the mystery of the universe is not broken, it becomes more mysterious, which simply makes the mystery more mysterious and the grievances more aggrieved. As the saying goes, private salt is more popular the more it is banned, it is just a futile effort.</p>
<h3>When Autumn Comes</h3>
<p>— Ji Juan</p>
<p>Perhaps everyone knows that with each cycle of seasons, each year, a tragedy called a "natural phenomenon" is playing out:</p>
<p>When the summer sun scorches suffocatingly, and struggles with all its might at the end of its own season, attempting a final, brilliant "last burst" of flame, there, on the horizon, comes a rustling, cold downpour, hitting the ground, like water rats churning, rising, then falling.</p>
<p>The rain continues for several days, and that cool, damp air is so comforting! During this time, the sun of the dog days begins to slowly droop its head, like a wounded tiger, or like a person sinking from youth into middle age. Its flame no longer has the courage and fervor of its youthful days, and instead, it begins to wither and become calm. So, the sky slowly rises, appearing as lonely and vast as the sea; the clouds slowly present more beautiful and ever-changing golden hues; the moon grows clearer and more pure; the atmosphere becomes more sluggish and cool. In this way, nature has completely arranged a world more suitable for middle-aged people. And so, this brown, worldly-wise, and calm autumn finally approaches step by step, silently, like an old man with a walking stick.</p>
<p>Autumn has finally crept in so silently, and the mountains are so blurred, the clouds so distant!</p>
<p>Yes! In the mountains, on the branches, in the corners of the damp brick walls of old foundations, on the tips of branches, on the flags of city shops, in the corner of a person's heart, in every tiny place, the shadows of autumn have been sprinkled little by little. During the day, a gentle breeze blows, and leaves leisurely fall to the ground. At night, a bronze mirror-like moon hangs in the middle of the sky, and unknown insects listen intermittently in the damp corners of the house. People's hearts also turn into a漠然 vast sea, empty and calm, little by little, as if constantly contemplating something, but not knowing what it is; as if listening to a sound, but unable to say what kind of words it is! All that can be felt is: a person's heart, a person's soul, is also gradually aging along with the withering of flowers, trees, and fruits, growing old! From past experience, I know that this is autumn, an autumn built for some sinking souls. Autumn is speechless, silent, and calm. It does not demand the flowery rhetoric of brocade flowers and green leaves from nature, like the young spring day. All it asks for are honest fruits and harvests—the achievements that have grown throughout the year. It just silently stretches out its dry hands, and in the calm voice of an elder, it gives us a terrible demand: "Here! Show me your fruits, you must prove how much you have grown!"</p>
<p>This is a difficult question to answer: autumn brings us a real "Judgment Day," and makes us feel guilty and tremble in a selfless chill!</p>
<p>It is truly difficult to describe, the heart is so lonely and empty! Seeing geese flying south, I really want to ask, what place has a high mountain—a mountain so high it's impossible to measure—I want to climb to the highest peak and make the wildest, most primitive cry to the world, to this whole human realm!</p>
<p>Yes, I really want to have a mad cry: I see the gloomy sun, I see the withered trees, I see the graying hairs on the young people's temples, and finally, in this pile of cruel natural phenomena, I see autumn!</p>
<p>Surprised, why is there that strange and uncomfortable feeling? Perhaps afraid, worried about the irrecoverable withering of some good weather? But this is not accurate; the sky and clouds are still so calm and clear, the weather of "Judgment Day" is not necessarily stormy, but think about that terrible withering…</p>
<p>Nature is selfless, the good days have finally passed, and now it is when autumn comes!</p>
<h3>Sun Fuchao</h3>
<p>— Shi Weizhi</p>
<p>One of the Character Sketches</p>
<p>Sun Fuchao, according to seniority, I should call him grand-uncle, but because he worked in my house since he was little, and is only a dozen years older than me, calling him grand-uncle seems like a joke. When he heard it, he would either blush and say, "Don't call me that, it sounds awkward," or he would put on an elder's airs, making his voice sound very serious: "Child, be good and don't make trouble, grand-uncle will buy you candy later!"</p>
<p>Before he could finish speaking, he couldn't help but burst out laughing first.</p>
<p>Whether he was blushing and forbidding us to call him grand-uncle, or pretending to be an elder, we were children, and when we were happy, we always liked to call him grand-uncle. Moreover, because he was afraid of us calling him that, we would call him grand-uncle repeatedly, until he agreed to us, and only when he answered us would we all laugh together, making him feel very embarrassed.</p>
<p>He loved to drink wine, he could even skip meals, but he had to have wine with every meal, but he was afraid of my father. Every</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>time he drank, he would always secretly drink behind my father's back. As soon as he heard my father's footsteps coming down from upstairs, he would always hide the wine, and hide the spiced beans, peanuts, and the like that went with the wine in a package in his pocket. He would only take it out to drink when my father went outside. Because of this, he would sometimes hurriedly eat a shallow bowl of rice, and sometimes he wouldn't even eat rice. When he heard my father's footsteps, he would pour the rice into the rice bucket, pick up the empty bowl, and eat the rice crumbs clean, so that my father would always think he had just finished eating. So he would put down the rice bowl and return to his bamboo chair to work.</p>
<p>But although he loved to drink, he advised others that it was best not to drink. He would not be stingy with spiced beans, peanuts, beef, and the like for us, letting us grab and eat as much as we wanted. But the Wu Jia Pi wine or tiger bone papaya wine in his hand, he would never let us drink, which was naturally because he loved wine as much as his life, but he deeply knew the harm of wine.</p>
<p>We don't know when he started to like wine, but we do know the reason why he wanted to drink.</p>
<p>After drinking his fill of wine, he would sing "The Little Widow Visits the Grave" or something while working. He would sing and sing, and in the end, he would always sing the Fengyang Flower Drum, "Other people's wives make silk and cloth, my wife has a pair of big feet," repeatedly,颠倒ing, always singing these two sentences.</p>
<p>His body was very strong, his skin was somewhat brown, and he had a Yellow Tianba tattooed on his chest. He could use his two hands to climb to the top of people's awnings without any effort.</p>
<p>In our eyes, he was optimistic. He wasn't like my father, who never smiled all day long. He was always talking and laughing all day long. When he was tired of laughing or talking, he would start drinking, as if drinking could forget some worries.</p>
<p>The family often sent letters, and he would always secretly ask me to read them to him. The letters always asked him for money. After listening, he would always silently tear the letters to pieces, and then drink wine again, and sing "The Little Widow Visits the Grave" and "Fengyang Flower Drum". When singing, or when drinking, he would sometimes suddenly remember something and say to me softly: "Don't tell your father that there are letters from home again."</p>
<p>Gradually, I knew that he had a family he didn't love, and a wife he didn't love.</p>
<p>I remember when my father wanted to fulfill my lifelong wish, he once mustered up the courage to protest to my father: "This is a lifelong matter, you have to be careful." Behind my back, he secretly asked me: "Do you like this marriage? Don't be shy, it's hard to find a wife!"</p>
<p>Later, I left home and went everywhere with my wife, whom I didn't love, to find food. I hadn't heard from him for a long time.</p>
<p>Recently, I heard news about him, saying: Fuchao is crazy, his body is going crazy from drinking, becoming foolish and demented, crying and laughing unpredictably. If he has money, he still goes to drink, and if he doesn't have money, he steals things when he sees them.</p>
<h3>Leisure and Clouds</h3>
<p>— Cheng Quan</p>
<p>The weather is gradually getting cooler, and autumn seems to be just around the corner again. At dusk, I return with a body covered in slight sweat and a lot of fatigue: Heavens! Maybe this is a bit of life's punishment? However, is true life really a fault, a sin? Why? The saints haven't said that, the gods haven't said that: the society said that! Yes, and there is…</p>
<p>Okay, let it treat life as a fault, let it punish and abuse the countless offenders in various ways; what I want to continue to say is that in the crime of the day, at night, with a wounded and tired body, I say, I actually have a little rest, a little real rest and leisure!</p>
<p>I sit down in the dark house, light a strong-flavored cigarette, let it catch fire, and the smoke rises thread by thread, thread by thread, rises and disappears. Then, I see the clouds outside the window! Those clouds that are always floating in the blue sky, like smoke!</p>
<p>(Clouds like smoke! Piles of them, floating in the vast sky like a colored canvas that has caught fire: crimson gold, bright red, violet! All are so full, so full of the essence of life! Layers upon layers, as vast as the wild mountains and passes. A person—a wandering person—easily misses his hometown, and clearly points out from the color of the clouds which one has floated over from the sky of his hometown. So, give it a thousand sounds of cherish! However, it is indifferent, wandering, and finally, in the constant drifting, it itself is constantly changing into the past. Yes, the clouds are changing!)</p>
<p>Changing! Like being pricked by a needle, I jump up suddenly! I no longer dare to trust my own reason; however, what's the use, the mirror of truth will show my own wrinkled face and pale temples; the life of youth is getting old day by day, the world has gone so far (maybe forward, maybe backward, but who knows?), in short, life is drifting, and it has also changed like a cloud!</p>
<p>Just like a cloud, drifting over from the gray sky of life, how did youth go? How did laughter disappear from the heart? All of this has become completely blurred like a dream of yesteryear. Moreover, it takes even greater adventurous courage to recall them—isn't a heavy footstep stepping forward step by step in the distance, in a vague distance, not long ago? Sluggish, gray, hitting people's hearts, like the drums in a funeral procession, it takes people to an unknown place. I thought of it! That's middle age! That's old age! That's death!</p>
<p>All are illusion! Life, who can deny that it is constantly changing in drifting like clouds?</p>
<p>Changing, until the coming of the night, using its black mourning dress to cover the earth, to cover the entire world!</p>
<p>There was a time when I read Longfellow's "Song of Life", the heavy footsteps of that life were felt: "From the soil you came! You will return to the soil!" But now, life is changing like clouds, drifting, what is hanging in front of a young child is no longer a lush green leaf a second later, but a brown-gray middle-aged curtain!</p>
<p>What kind of mood will follow? As if an old boatman on a small wooden boat has received a premonition of the wind and waves in the sea, waiting curiously, preparing, but constantly trembling.</p>
<p>Looking at the clouds, I felt as cold and disappointed as if I had sunk into an ice cave. I seemed to see the withered face of life and hear its gradually weakening pulse! What life gives people is only a cluster of intangible emptiness like the clouds in the sky, a change as dreamlike as a dream!</p>
<p>(The cigarette has already burned to the end of the butt, and what remains are some ashes of destruction!)</p>
<p>Leisure time is for watching the clouds, but today, finally, leisure has brought unspeakable horror. It's foolish!</p>
<p>(The night has come!)</p>
<p>I am afraid, I even dare not fall asleep, I know: tonight's dream will definitely be a terrible one again.</p>
<p>I decided, I will never look at the clouds again.</p>
<h3>Emotions of a Galloping Horse</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Again, "End of the Century! End of the Century!"</p>
<p>When I even have to search for the food to fill my stomach today in the dark corners of the beautiful city, I let out such a heavy sigh, and at the same time, the strings of my heart are fully drawn, as complex, urgent, and chaotic as a quartet, and even my nervous system feels a little swollen!</p>
<p>My emotions are mixed with a lot of the element of fire, which manipulates my joy, anger, sorrow, and joy. In one moment I am laughing, in the next moment I am crying. Sometimes I just stare blankly and think inexplicably, as if I have the responsibility to think of something to shift the difficult problem that makes me laugh and cry, but what to think of? ——In the blink of an eye, those difficult problems that make me laugh and cry still come at me.</p>
<p>I look up at the sky, the sky is wooden like my brain nerves, a few wandering clouds, at the lowest, are only still breathing with me! I run around the room, the room is naturally small, I think even if it were bigger, it wouldn't be able to contain my huge and unparalleled resentment, because the vast and boundless sky is also pitifully small in front of me, it is really small, even a place for my knees to rest has become a luxury.</p>
<p>The road has become the playground for my emotions, the tune is impassioned, it competes with the gale, crosses the Himalayas and the Alps Plateau, crosses the only ocean system on the earth, and also wanders through the star systems listed in the sky. The soul unknowingly and seemingly intentionally leaves this body that can only be considered un-stiff, I am thinking, heaven and earth are only a humble and narrow poor hut, I can't find anything of "me" at all, I want to go outside the sky, there is an extra desire to discover the paradise in the outside world. But when my soul and body reunite, I realize that my white-haired top, which is as white as the phlegm I spit out, and my top hat are covered with banana peels and melon seeds that were thrown down from the upper foreign buildings at some unknown time. I hate them, I drive them away ——One grain at a time.</p>
<p>I didn't get to the sky after all ——Very clearly I am still in the world, everything in front of me will not deceive me. I sweep my famine-stricken pupils towards the small stalls with scaly combs, and the unique fragrances that are too much to take in prick my sense of smell, and I drool as I accept them, but when I look back around me, there are still many people drooling, I am not lonely anymore, in the vast universe, my life is not lonely, fragile, and desperately desolate.</p>
<p>I completely returned to harmony with a lingering mood, and from my sweat-soaked back, I suddenly felt a clear and faint coolness. When I turned around, it was an old man who had been abandoned by the "prosperous age" and was flashing with hungry eyes like me ——I call him that is instinctive, not at all an excessive compliment, and he has that palm fan, and he also has one more production tool than me, he is really richer than me, but he is only fanning my top that only contains one copper coin, which is really an odd injustice! But he is still fanning without feeling and enthusiastically, his steps following my speed, and the opening and closing of the fan also coincides with the expansion and contraction of my lungs, "A gentleman helps others achieve their beauty", so a copper coin also gently bids me farewell</p>
<p>And he went behind two fashionable girls again, fanning, fanning, but the wind silk only fluttered the lower end of their cheongsams, not invading their "charitable" heart garden, and at the same time, it was clear that the fanning did not have the magic power of Yonghonglin and the cold air to drive away the fire element; and they seemed to be even more stingy than me, not even leaving a copper coin for the old man. But he was not tired, not annoyed at all, and turned</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>

<p>his face to the gentleman in the long gown there, he was chasing out, struggling, relying on that only tool, it seemed that he wanted to live a happy and thorough life.</p>
<p>But what do I have? ——I think; yes, I am still not empty-handed, I have painless and worry-free hands and feet, I have a heart that the law can't control, thinking of this, my emotions are like a galloping horse flying over again, but not the vast outside world, but the realistic harmony.</p>
<p>"From the hands of the devil, save the people of the spiritual world. 'No matter who, as long as they continue to work hard, we can make them transcendent'. Heaven also has loving sympathy, and all the gods sincerely welcome him".</p>
<p>Goethe transformed the angel in "Faust" and sang like this, and I also sing like this, and I blindly believe it.</p>

<h3>New Song Introduction</h3>
<p>A Sight of Desolation</p>
<p>(1) Society is so licentious, people's hearts are so decadent, look up and see a sight of desolation! The room is full of colors, the room is full of the smell of meat, I don't know how many young people are buried!</p>
<p>(2) If you have hands and don't apply them, it's the same as not having hands; Demon Palace! My husband, was buried alive by you! If you have legs and don't go upwards, it's the same as not having legs, Demon Palace! My husband, was buried alive by you! The red lights of the year are brilliantly shining, numbing the heart; the thick smell of wine, the fragrance of meat, fascinated his ambition; lost his children, all hope; brought back, a series of resentments and annoyances; look up, a sight of desolation, lower your head, the world is full of vicissitudes!</p>
<p>(3) If you have a brain and don't think, it's the same as not having a brain; without a brain, it's the same as being disabled, everything has become despair! If you have strength and don't work, it's the same as being disabled and paralyzed; only enjoy! Can't last long, life is only sad! Love songs are singing together, beautiful songs are leisurely, covering his thoughts; the dance of eyebrows, the release of color, buried his strength; young people! The country is in trouble; it's not the time for singing and dancing! Young people! Open your eyes and take a look! A sight of desolation!</p>

<h3>Microphone Broadcasts</h3>
<p>The "Performing Arts Laboratory" founded by Lu Shi and Liu Yawei is said to have been ordered to be banned by the Education Bureau due to its unsound organization.</p>
<p>Zhang Shichuan and Hu Die of the Mingxing Film Company yesterday convened a meeting of all actors to discuss the methods to be carried out for the Aviation Arts Fair because of its date.</p>
<p>The location shooting of the new era's "Mr. Wang Goes to the Countryside" has been completed, and the protagonist Huang Naishuang returned to Shanghai from Suzhou yesterday.</p>
<p>Cartoonist Wan Laiming, Gu Chan, after arriving in Beijing (Chao Chen has not gone), are quite welcomed by the literary and art circles and relatives and friends, and are very busy with social engagements. It is said that the Central Film Studio also hosted a banquet to entertain them, and plans to hire them to produce a cartoon film.</p>
<p>Xu Xinfu's "Emerald Horse" is a full-fledged detective and martial arts masterpiece. Yesterday, the scene of detective pursuit was filmed, which was quite exciting, especially the shooting of real guns, which was daunting.</p>
<p>Shu Xiuwen and Mei Xi are busy rehearsing the play "Heroes and Beauties" these days. It is said that the director is Ying Yunwei, but the name under which it will be performed in the future will probably not escape the scope of the "Stage Association."</p>
<p>The "Film Tea Party" in Shanghai will die after two or three sessions, and the "Film Tea Party" in Nanjing has not moved after the eighth session. Now Peiping is also preparing a "Film Tea Party," and its fate is unknown.</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Evening News" recently plans to cancel "Volcano Silver Island" and open up a film, drama, and broadcasting section to enrich the content.</p>
<h3>Hu Die Sells "Evening Primrose"</h3>
<p>"Evening Primrose" now has only one scene left, the dance hall scene, which is about to be completed.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the Mingxing photography studio, the last scene of the dance hall was filmed, and Hu Die stood at the door of the dance hall selling "Evening Primrose."</p>
<p>On this day, young master Sun Min had an appointment with a girlfriend to dance, but she missed the appointment and came with another man, and they were particularly intimate. This was really enough to make Sun Min angry. He ran out of the dance hall in hatred. At this time, Hu Die was selling "Evening Primrose" at the front door. As soon as he discovered Hu Die's appearance, not only did he not find it annoying, but he also expressed a special affection for her, giving her a large roll of banknotes and only buying a "Evening Primrose" from her.</p>
<p>After this scene was filmed, Hu Die said with a smile: "A flower can sell for so much money, it would be great if I really sold Evening Primrose."</p>
<h3>Talking About Wang Ying and Shi Chao's Acting Skills</h3>
<p>"The Goddess of Liberty" is about to be released, and for Wang Ying, it can be said to be her most successful work on the screen, and it is also the first sound in the sound film movement. According to her, "The Goddess of Liberty" moved her too much. The entire plot is like a true depiction of her life. In the photography studio, she forgot that she was acting. The joys and sorrows, partings and reunions, joys and angers, songs and cries on the screen are her inner outpouring of passion. She thinks that life will never be so real again. This is what prompted her acting skills to reap a deeper level of harvest. As for Shi Chao, he is one of the new talents selected by Dian Tong in 1935. In the year of the sound film movement, Dian Tong had great hopes for him. This time, in "The Goddess of Liberty," he plays a passionate revolutionary youth. His agile movements, pure emotions, and indomitable spirit realistically portray the personality of the characters in the play.</p>
<h3>Mr. Zheng Zhengqiu's Memorial Service Will Be Held at the Lake Society on the 25th</h3>

Yesterday, the Chaozhou Shanghai Association of Fellow Townsmen convened a meeting of various groups to discuss and decided to hold it at the Lake Society on Beijing Road on the 25th of this month.</p>
<h3>"Games of Love" Released</h3>
<p>"Games of Love" is the first collaboration between child stars Freddie Thomas and Helen Parrish, and has achieved extraordinarily amazing results, not inferior to Freddie Bartholomew (who played David's childhood) in "David Copperfield," and the story is quite thought-provoking. At the same time, the specially screened cartoon masterpiece "Little Birds on Sticks" and the slapstick short film "Future Law" are both top-notch quality, and are now being released in Nanjing. The image on the left is a scene from "Games of Love."</p>
