<h3 id="c42">英德海軍協定簽字 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— 昂</p>
<p>英德海軍恊定業已簽字。此乃英國國家主義之具體表現。亦希特勒親英拒俄外交之初步成功。國家之圖自强者。其應付關繫本國安危之根本問題。必有其獨立不倚之方針。决不願輕易遷就他國之意旨。今英國不顧法意之非議。單獨與德妥恊。亦可作如是觀。此次談判之情勢。殆與一九二七年日內瓦海軍會議失敗後。英國與法單獨談判大遭德美疑懼之往事。如出一轍。所異者。此次談判尙與凡爾賽和約軍事條欵之存廢問題有所牽涉耳。</p>
<p>英國祇顧自己之利害。一再優容希特勒廢北和約條文。其是非姑不具論。茲僅就英德兩國之直接關係作大體之檢討。德之復興。經濟方面英實利之。軍備方面。則英國所感受之威脅。實不亞於法俄諸國。觀於英國會最近亟亟通過擴增空軍至千五百架一案。可見一斑。先言陸軍。德之恢復徵兵制。對英國防之威脅。不若法俄之甚。蓋英國軍略前綫。籍洛卡諾條約之保障。已自荷蘭比利時而進展至萊茵河以東。希特勒最近之外交宣言。且力以遵守該約爲言。陸地安全自可無慮。</p>
<p>至於海軍與空軍。則戰前海軍競爭之禍害以及戰時齊伯林飛艇夜　倫敦之恐懼。殷鑒不遠。英國方面自不能不感覺直接之危懼。今海軍問題。巳以三成五之噸數許德而臻妥恊。則尙待磋商者惟空軍耳。締結空軍公約以補充洛卡諾之議。鮑爾溫曾一再言之。新外相霍爾昨復告下院。謂政府現正審愼考慮此事。且深知其迫切重要。自應與關係各國交換意見云云。是則今後英國對歐洲之國際談判當以訂立空軍公約爲主要問題矣。</p>
<p>自華盛頓會議以來。英美日法意五海軍國之態度。形成二派。法意爲大陸派。主張海軍問題廳與一般軍備問題。聯合討論。與美日主張海軍問題儘可單獨解决者不同。英國則周旋於兩者之間。祗須與其所謂「必要」條件不悖。則左右皆可逢源。英海軍之所謂必要條件者。卽以全球言。其海軍力應與世界最强之海軍國相等。且至少須有輕巡艦五十艘。以維護海洋交通。以歐洲言。則其海軍應與大陸任何二國之聯合艦隊相等。此爲英國海軍確定之方針。至以何手段達此目的。非所計也。</p>
<p>英國今茲對德妥協。曾將其結果通知法意美日四國。美日對英德仍保持比率制。觀感雖異。然以其純爲歐洲問題。自樂於贊同。法意則於其覆文中仍堅持其海陸空相提並論之原來態度。對英德單獨妥恊表示反對。惟法意兩國間海軍均等問題。至今猶爲懸案。由是以觀。自英德妥協後。歐局之趨向殆不外兩途。一則斯特萊柴會議之陣綫。恐難免於破裂。各國關係將益陷糾紛複雜之局。一則各國或將力謀以個別談判。導致一般恊定。漸次促成集體和平之制。據最近消息。英政府爲海軍問題已派艾登於今日赴巴黎接洽。而法意俄三國亦允派海軍專家赴倫敦協同討論。是則國際合作之局。已因英德海軍協定之成立而漸見開展矣。</p>

<p>招商局滬甬班輪新江天號、局方爲整頓茶房、革除冷水班、宣吿停航、茶房等現已表示就範、遵令登記、故該局已擬於明日復航、茲將詳情、分述如下、</p>
<p>冷水班廢除</p>
<p>新江天輪中除正額茶房外、尚有所謂冷水班副手茶房、其名額轉較正額茶房、加增一倍、以致旅客上船、觸目盡是茶房、而正額茶房、反可不事所事、坐取巨利、局方爲改革茶房制、第一個主點、卽將船內爲改革茶房制、第一個主點、卽將額茶房、及事務員、限令該項非正式之冷水班茶房、尅日一律離船、此後不許再上新江天輪、此事現已辦到、</p>
<p>茶房允登記</p>
<p>該輪停航、卽爲各茶房抗拒登記而起、自星期一停班後、在輪各茶房、亦知非反對所能了事、故自昨日起、各正額茶房、已漸漸就範、不再堅决反抗、局方派員到輪責令各人餮記時、各茶房已表示容納、遵照局方所頒登記表、自動塡就送局、並在登記表內附粘各人照片、以資核對、</p>
<p>議定茶房額</p>
<p>新江天輪茶房名額、如照規定、祇許一百七十餘名、但今旣有二百八十餘人、局方爲暫維各人生活計、仍照二百八十餘人登記雇用、但不許再雇副手、此點亦均同意、惟據傳述、萬一船內不需要如許茶房時、局方或再抽出一部、留滬訓練、預爲將來派充他輪之地步、此事尙在協商中、</p>
<p>革除惡習慣</p>
<p>各茶房在船並無薪工、全恃乘客小賬酒資、爲收入之大部、但該局於各該茶房、並未收取押櫃及證金、故現由局議定新章、革除需索旅客酒資之惡習、茶房由局給發工薪、每月每人暫定薪洋十六元、另貼伙食洋五元、各茶房旣有工食、卽不許再向乘客需索分文、由局發貼通吿、並在船票上刋明、勸旅客勿再有私給小賬之事、破壞新制、該局如此辦理、每月約須支出五千餘元、</p>
<p>星期六復班</p>
<p>各項問題、旣巳解决、則改革新制巳可迎刃而解、昨日總經理劉鴻生、巳與各科主任商定、此次新江天停航、爲　除冷水班、改警茶房而起、今各茶房巳表示服從、自無繼續停航之必要、决議本嚴期六（二十一日）起照常開班行駛、一塲風潮、巳可吿一段落矣、</p>

<p>本埠各團體援助旅暹華僑聯合會、前派華僑聯合會黃建中、寗波同鄉會陳魯芹·廣東同鄉會鄭季楷·市商會張南印·潮州同鄉會郭啟明、等五代表、於十五日晋京、向中央請求早日與暹訂立商約、及交涉關於遝羅無理壓迫我華僑事宜、結果頗爲圓滿、該請願團茲以任務已畢、除鄭季楷·張南印·郭啟明·等三代表已於十九日返滬外、共餘陳魯芹·黃建中·二代表、亦於昨日先後返滬、茲悉該會定於明日（二十二日）召集執行委員會議、報吿晋京請願結果、及商討派員赴閩粵港各地、接洽實施禁運暹米事宜、申時社記者昨以暹羅遠東考察團否認暹政府排華事、叩詢華僑聯合會秘書陳魯芹氏於呂班路會所、承答如下、</p>
<p>在京請願結果圓滿</p>
<p>陳氏首報吿此次在京請願經過情形、略云、請願團代表五人、於十五日、搭十一時夜快車晉京、於翌晨七時卽抵首都當與京方歡迎代表會見、共商關於請願、及聯合投遞覺書於暹考察團辦法、嗣以沿途勞頓、遂闢中央飯店三六三號、略事休息、並計劃十七日請願所取步驟、十七日上午分向中央黨部·行政院·外交部·僑務委員等請願、中央黨部由葉秘書長楚傖接見、對該團援助僑胞之熱忱、深致嘉許、並允卽日轉陳中央、令駐日蔣大使繼續與暹交涉、復會同京市農工商學婦女各團體聯合會、至華僑招待所致覺書於暹考察團、請彼等將國人希望暹政府取消各種虐待華僑苛例、改善僑胞待遇等、轉達該國政府、午後、在中央飯店招待京市新聞界、到各報記者數十人、山黃建中報吿請願之目的及使命、與暹羅壓迫華僑情形，、各報代表亦先後發言、表示願盡輿論天職、會場空氣頗爲緊張、晚間僑委會常委蕭吉珊氏、亦設宴爲各代表洗塵、各代表在京連日呼號奔走、備極苦辛、所幸結果尙頗圓滿、聊足自慰、</p>
<p>否認排華文過飾非</p>
<p>陳氏次乃答復記者所詢暹考察團否認排華事伴、陳氏對於該團所談各節、大多抹煞現存事實、表示遺憾、渠暹方接得暹京華僑團體之報吿、可資證明、其報吿略云、據探悉暹京附近之吞武里武卡羅縣居民　他越氏、係暹電車工會領袖、前嘗奉暹民黨領袖命、鼓動華商米廠之米工、提出加薪條件、因而釀成大罷工、　氏乃利用華僑勞資糾紛機會、將華僑工廠收歸國營、使暹工人坐享其利、今又於五月二十三日、以便利營業及可救濟暹工人等爲理由、上呈暹勞工局、請求勞工局進　開設火礱及火鋸勞工局接得此項呈文後、以所呈各事、爲勞工局範圍以外之事、乃將呈文轉呈政府審查、可望通過、如上所述、則暹羅排華之舉動、方繼起不已、該考察團所言各節、爲飾詞掩非、殆無可諱言、</p>
<p>變通強迫徒事敷衍</p>
<p>關於取締華僑敎育事、陳氏云、暹敎部前因我國人共起反對、其所施於華僑之種種苛例、羣情激憤、甚且倡議抵制暹米、以施懲戒、爲謀緩和我民氣確曾一度提出强迫班折衷辦法、准予各華校重新註冊、呈請暹政府、在校內設立强迫班、乃暹京消息傳來、各華校前往敎部註冊者、槪未批准、因暹府對我國人、尙持觀望態度、至暹遠東考察團談話云、暹對外僑所辦學校、並未迫令盡敎暹文、僅每週支配遝文數小時云、對其文過飾非、有意欺瞞國人、實爲明甚、查暹敎部去年通令各華校辦强迫班、所訂課程表內、每週須讀暹文二十三小時、該敎部條例前譯登各報、國人所早共知悉其條例內且迫令華僑子弟、凡年在七歲至十四歲者、均須入暹校受强迫敎育、事實彰彰徒事掩飾、又復何用、</p>
<p>派員港粵謀抵暹米</p>
<p>陳氏最後云、　等五代表、擬於二十一日會集、作一度洽議後、明日决舉行常務委員會議、實行派員至廣州香港厦門各地、聯絡進行、實施抵制暹米入口、以促暹政府之覺悟、在兩國未訂交之前、務先達到下列三期望、（一）在政治上取消旅暹華僑之當兵服役、（二）在經濟上取消各種苛捐雜稅、（三）在教育上務達取消强迫華軍讀選文至二一十三小時之命令、華童應否讀暹文、應由我國敎部自行命令、並不得强迫華校敎員受暹政府之暹文考試、如以上三項、能如愿以償、則兩國國民之情感、自可日趨親善、而兩國間之互訂商約、庶幾亦可早達目的也云、</p>

<p>少時讀淸俞曲園貓睛篇，始知貓睛定時，旦暮晴雨，各不相同，若以之定時，實非準確，後以家中蓄貓驗之，信然。</p>
<p>茲特摘錄其篇中語，以吿諾世之一般信貓睛定時者：</p>
<p>「本朝無名氏調變類篇，有貓眼定時歌云：『子午綫，卯酉圓，寅申巳亥銀杏樣，辰戍丑未側如錢。」余載之茶香室讀鈔。</p>
<p>「王夢薇云：『貓睛夜明而畫眊。午時日光正烈，貓睛畏日，每閉目而眠。或啟視之，則爲陽光所逼，其睛歛如一綫。辰巳日威未熾，申酉日燄已裏，故皆縮而如棗核。然至夜則六時皆圓。惟捉向燈下觀之，亦如棗核然，畏燈光也。曾記有一日貓伏案頭，時正卓午，呼至後軒騐之，睛僅微纖耳；　向南窗，則緊閉其目，抉而觀之，頓縮如綫。又一日，風雨如晦，時亦正午，視其睛仍圓也。同一午時而晴雨異，同在一日而又以地之明暗異，可悟其理矣。昔人定時之歌，特因盡所見而推之於夜，實亦未嘗細騐之也。</p>
<p>「余按夢薇之說頗有理。酉陽雜俎云：「貓目睛旦暮圓，及午豎歛如誕。』則古人固以畫言耳。」</p>
<p>近見巴玲君有生命之地晷儀（見前兒童週刋）篇，所述亦不外說貓睛可以定時，言之鑿鑿，似係對小孩子說謊話矣</p>

<p>— 逸梅</p>
<p>無論都市鄕村，通都僻壞，沒有一處瞧不到醫生的招牌，實在醫藥和人生的關係太密切了，有不可或離之勢。鄙人平日頗多關於岐黃的趣聞，爰把它記載出來，以爲談助。</p>
<p>獨山金小巖，和名醫傳芝庭爲友。金貧不能自存，性喜藝蘭，庭中有蘭數十盆。某年冬，因病不自收拾，秋間所生的蘭蕊，完全冰僵，不能開放，金病到明年夏日纔痊，一天傅來瞧見了庭中冰僵蘭蕊，依然兀立，沒有拔去，因偶有所觸，對小巖道：「你處境很窘，今有一樓會，可以使你略有所潤。」金問他什麼事？傅說：「你快把庭中的泳蘭蕊，完全收藏起來，今巳乾燥，不致再爛。某官兒貪而不仁，現在他的兒子患病，很信任我，已服藥數帖，大約非藥百帖不爲功。今後爲定方寫藥引，用泳蘭蕊，他無從覓得，我可吿訴他你有收藏，矚他來買，索價儘昂，他爲愛子，必不吝惜。」後來某官兒果來買冰蘭蕊，每蕊兩錢，後遞加每蕊銀一兩，最後三蕊，竟售銀十兩，總計前後共得九十餘兩，小巖因得謀數月之糧呢。</p>
<p>孟河御醫診治慈禧太后的病，先納賄於太監，得見太醫院連日處方，什九補劑，深知痰湧氣急的原因。便親自煎藥以進，慈禧服後，果然日見起色，大加賞賜。歸來對至好說：所進不過蘿蔔汁罷哩。</p>
<p>陸土諤先生，他是小說家而兼醫家。所以他所著的幾種武俠小說裏面，動輒發揮醫藥的原理。因此有人說他小說而醫學化。近來他爲校經山房輯成「國醫新話」，出版後，承他惠贈一部，讀了醰醰有味，原來他是用寫小說的方法來寫醫書、便爲醫學而小說化。士諤二者兼擅，無怪得參互錯綜之妙哩。</p>

<p>第十五回　苦口婆心不平空拍案錢聲燈影可憐正賣人</p>
<p>只聽到胡嫂子說，這也不是作什麼買賣，天天說，也沒有多大意思。我們就是先頭那幾句話。北海心裏一動，便不願走。這進屋子中間，是天棚蓋着一個天井，中間擺了一張長桌子，放了幾分大小報紙在那裏，讓人隨便去看，北海也就將背對了那窗戶，伏在桌上看報，這就乘便聽他們說些什麼。賈多才接着說，並不是我作事好拖延，都因爲你們作事不利落。那天我一頭高興，請他吃飯，他滾了一身的泥，倒在姓程的床上睡了半天。胡嫂子就搶着說：喲！那要什麼緊，那程老爺也不在屋子裏。賈多才說。這個我倒也不去管他，爲什麼自那天以後、老不見面。胡嫂子說：一來是他爲了那天的事，有些害臊。二來賈老爺這兩天很忙，在家的時候少，所以他沒有來。賈多才說：就算你說得有理，爲什麼今天他不來呢？楊浣花說：這個，你也應當原諒人家。人家是一個大姑娘。常常坐在當面，聽了別人，提他的終身大事。事情若是一說就妥呢、那也不要緊。無如說來說去，總是不成交。你想想人家做女孩子的人，總也有些不好意思。賈多才說：什麼不好意思，他一絲不掛，在姓程的床上，也睡過的。現在我們說一句利落的話，他的家，我不能管。到底要多少錢身價，這位胡嫂子回去問一句。價目說的不大，自然有個商量。價目大了，就此一言了結，以後我再也不管。（二四五）</p>

<p>我想得很出神，良久才止住，抬起頭來，恰巧迎面所見的就是那一排建築在萬壽山邊的大殿，因此我又想起來了！我想：我方才所懸擬的那個譬喻，實在是很近情的。—因爲那些蓋着黃瓦的大宮殿是很可用以代表滿淸帝國的，在事實上，滿淸帝國確乎就是太后的保姆；所以伊此刻眞好算是一個小孩子，正在一條船上玩要，由他的保姆監護着。不過這個孩子未免太珍貴了，除却這個精神上的偉大的保姆之外，還得有許多的師傳，敎習，以及女管事們照料着伊，不使伊受半些的傷害。</p>
<p>我還待再想，太后巳將這一餐特別的午飯用完了，幷用着感嘆的語氣說道：</p>
<p>「今天，我們眞可說是快樂到極點了！」伊漱着口，一面這樣的說：「因此使我突然想起了我們的大聖人孔夫子的話來，他不是說過「樂不可極」，「樂極生悲」的兩句話嗎？別的古人也說過憂患和歡樂往往是更番着和人們周旋的；所以我想，我們今天這樣的過分的歡樂之後，立刻，或者在一小時之後，或者遲一些，在明天，也許那造化小兒也不免要把我們播弄一番了！』</p>
<p>伊這幾句話一送進了我的耳鼓中來，就發生了絕大的影饗，使我不由怦然心動，並且還担憂，伊因此將自尋煩惱起來；幸而伊也只是口頭說說而巳，並不就化樂爲悲。我瞧伊的意思大槪是因爲伊雖覺得這種顧慮是不無可信的，只是伊也知道像這樣輕鬆歡暢的時候，眞是伊所極不容易得到的；所以就存着今朝有酒今朝醉的念頭，且待那造化小兒明日弄出了什麼玄虛來再作理會了。（三四五）</p>

<p>可是今年全成例外了。</p>
<p>「十八九元一担的繭價，不撒午句謊，銅板好處都沒有！」一個滿臉皺紋的老農這樣咕噥着。「我預算這兩籮繭子賣六元六角，死命爭論只賣五元五角，贖了米顧不到贖衣服，贖衣服就顧不到米。」唉聲　氣地又一個在那裏自言自語。</p>
<p>收繭商人那麼焦急着，放了一天價，貨色一些也不見得擠，貨色收不足，準定虧本。職員們本來是最神氣不過的。在這樣的空氣裏，再也使不出勁兒來。</p>
<p>頂失望的要算是兩傍的小吃攤了，賣繭子的祇有這幾個，這幾個又這樣的慳吝，一個一個很迅速地走過去，怪難爲情似的儘着要避開攤主人的視綫。</p>
<p>興奮的，安慰的，展開着笑臉的，一切巳成爲過去之夢，再也不在今年的繭市裏留一些印象，蠶桑的確是失敗了。</p>

<h3 id="c191">一個被殘殺的女性（上） <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 尤愛梅</p>
<p>在這自殺案一天多似一天的當兒，我的表姊朱慶璋，也在兩個月前，自縊身亡了。這個兇耗，直到最近幾天，纔由我母親寫信吿訴了我，我和伊誼關至戚，情若同胞，自然感受到異常的悲哀，忍不着爲伊洒下兩行熱淚。同時，我對於伊的自殺，覺得與普通人的情形，有點兩樣；因爲，我曉得伊所以陷入不幸的環境，是吃人的禮敎所賜予的；伊所以走向減亡的道路，是封建的社會所逼迫的；因此，我以爲伊表面上是個自殺者，而實際上却是個被殘殺者！</p>
<p>伊的身世，說來眞是可憐：雖然生在一個中產之家，生活總算可過，可惜這個家庭，完全是十七世紀的規模，全家的男婦老幼，無一不具着一副頑固的頭腦，和莊嚴的面孔；加上伊又早年喪父，算來只有一個寡母，是慈愛可親的，其餘，無論見了祖父，祖母，或者叔叔，嬸娘，都是話也不敢多說一句的。所以，伊自幼兒，便在這死灰色的空氣裏，被束縛得將天置和活潑，消失凈盡；而養成了溫柔的性情，怯懦的意志，無論受着怎樣的難堪，伊只有背着人偷哭一塲了事。</p>
<p>更不幸的，是伊父親死了未久，伊母親又在吐血了；因了伊父親患的是肺病的緣故，有點疑心是受着了傳染。那時，伊母親呻吟牀褥，眼看着伊和伊的妹妹，心裏在想着：一假使自已一病不起，丟了這兩個弱小的女兒，是决沒有好日子過的，不如早作安排，替伊們許了婆家，算做伊們的生路吧」。就在這樣的意識之下，遂連忙憑了鳩媒的撮合，將伊許給林溪鄉下一個徐姓的家裏了。後來，伊母親並沒曾死，都想不到對於伊的終身，已因此鑄成了。大錯；於是，伊這一生最大的悲劇、從此一幕幕地向前展開了：</p>
<p>伊的丈夫，姓徐，是個鄉村的紈褲：他沒受過家庭敎育，以致性情乖戾，品行不端。成年以後，他父親曾一度送他到南京某中學去讀書，但未及一年，便又退學回來，學問兩宇，自然更談不到了。可是，他也有他的專長，吃，着，嫖，賭，四項的門檻，他却都是精通不過的呀。那時，他已姘識了一偭女郎，常常對着他母親大鬧，要同未婚妻解約，而娶他的情侶。後來，這種種的風聲，都傳到伊的家裏來了。伊的母親，也很後悔。然而，寳應的社會，是古道可風的，姓朱的門第，是詩禮傳家的！解約，是何等有傷風化，而玷辱鬥楣的事呀？至於男孩子的好壞，更不能成爲問題，嫁鷄尙要隨鷄，嫁狗也要隨狗，何况，他畢竟是個人呢？而且，只要女兒的命好，嫁到他家以後，他自然就會變做好人的。因此，反而想盡方法來，委曲求全。結果，在淸明節那天，趁着大家循例到松崗踏靑的熱鬧當兒，伊母親假裝着領伊前去遊玩，暗中却由媒人將伊的丈夫領着，從伊們面前經過，指點着他，看一看伊的容貌：果不其然，伊的丈夫，因爲比着自己的情侶更爲美麗，便拋棄了那女郎，而急急地訂期迎娶伊了。</p>

<h3 id="c229">果戈理的關於描寫人物的話 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 辜定</p>
<p>果戈理的「外套一，在寫到那主人翁阿加　維奇以外的一個人物的時候，他忽然挿入這樣一段話；</p>
<p>「關於這位裁縫自然倒不必多說，但是旣已提到他，爲使小說中每位人物的性格完全描寫得淸楚起見，沒法，只好也在這里來談談他罷、」</p>
<p>他把這裁縫介紹了幾句之后，寫到裁縫的妻時，又說：</p>
<p>「我們旣已扯到他的妻，關於她也得說兩句。」</p>
<p>這，曾經使我大大的思索了一番。因爲我讀了的當時，似乎發生了這樣的一個感想：這篇作品無疑地是好的；但一篇作品中，在介紹人物時是否好這樣挿入作者的「小說作法」之類似的意見，是否會因這樣而使作品的完整受到影響？自然，果戈理的年代離我們遠了，也許他在當時有所感觸，有使他不得不那樣寫的原因；但在現在的我們讀起來，總覺得有研究必要。思索了一番之后，結果似乎沒有甚麼結果；不過，因此倒使我得到另一方面的啟示：就是果戈理那對於寫作小說的寳貴意見。現在讀到他的「死靈魂」，那意見，更使我　到一個非常淸　的輪廓。在「第二章的開頭，他寫到主人翁乞乞科夫的家丁時這樣說：</p>
<p>「就在這里把我們的大角色的兩個家丁，給讀者來介紹一下，大約也不算多事的罷。當然，他們倆並不是什麼重要人物，僅僅是所謂第二流或者第三流的人們，而且這史詩的骨幹和顯著的展開，也和他們無關，至多　不過碰一下，或者帶一筆；——但作者是什麼事都喜歡精細的……</p>
<p>因此，使我想到大多數初學寫作的時候，常常容易犯這樣的毛病：就是在作品中沒有能把每個人物——無論重要的或不重要的——的面貌的性格或詳或簡地描寫出來；常常總是性急地只顧到故事的飛速發展，以致有許多人物只是寫出一個名字來就完事。那結果，當然容易使人發生是在讀着篇「新聞紀事」似的感覺，而不是藝術品、醫治這毛病，我覺得果戈理的這些話，確是一劑對症的良藥。</p>
<p>這還不算，果戈理在死靈魂中還更進一步給我們以更切實的提示：</p>
<p>「瑪尼羅夫便引他的朋友到屋里去。從大門走過前廳，走過食堂，雖然快得很，但我們却想利用了這極短的時間，成不成自然說不定，來講講　於這主人的幾句話。不過作者應該聲明，這樣的計劃是很困難的。還是用大排塲，來描寫一個性格的容易。這里只好就是這樣的把顏料抹上畫布去——發閃的黑眼睛，濃密的眉毛，深的額上的皺紋，儼然的搭在肩頭的烏黑或是血紅的外套——小照畫好了；然而這樣的到處皆是的，外觀上非常相像的紳士。是因爲看慣了罷，却大槪都有甚麼微妙的，很難捉摸的特徵的——這些人的小照就很難畫。倘要這微妙的、若有若無的特徵擺在眼面前，就必須格外的留心，還得將那用鑒識人物所練就的眼光，很深的射進人的精神的底里去。」</p>
<p>這一段最后的那幾句，更是非常的重要。他畫了一個人物給我們看；但他立刻又指明，這，還是不够的。重要的是：要把那「微妙的，若有若無的特徵擺在眼面前，」「還得將那用鑒識人物所練就的眼光，很深的射進人的精神的底里去。」</p>

<p>— 李三郎</p>
<p>躺在床上，那破壞了的帆布床總是劈劈拍拍的響個不停的，好像帶來一種異樣的影子，把我在白大的時候爲了生活的奔波而昏眩與疲乏的腦海盪動着，盡是可怕的紛亂。又好像悲劇在迅速的影片上閃動，一慕一幕地，忽而高歡，忽地痛苦、忽而流淚，似乎生活所給予我的都是可怕的影子，縱使我曾在岐途的山嶺里爬到平坦的地面，以爲從此就可以安寗地向着美麗的鄉境里大踏步前進了，那也許只是夢想、但是小孩子的時候做過了許多美麗而可愛的夢，那時的夢是夢着自己的將來是怎麼的偉大，是夢着自己的無限的幸福。然而，到了現在已完全地消失了。不但連夢想將來的機會都沒有、就是生活己不給我做夢，也好像連做夢的勇氣都消失了一樣，可不是嗎？我走下了高而險要的岐途的山嶺，在平靜的地面，以爲可以安寗地過着日子，但是，這時代已不是這樣的簡單或平凡，不到一會，我又感到平靜的環境實在不是平靜，一刹那，前面已不是平坦的大地，而又且可怕的山嶺，狂濤的茫茫的大海，飢寒的交逼又會駕臨旅人的我的身上，于是，我又得掙扎，祈望着太陽光照射着大地，我可以從中間慢慢地找尋出我的路，我又得爬過叢密的山嶺，或者遇着狂濤的海洋　，我得找到渡過海面的輕舟，飄呀飄的又飄過可怕的海洋。</p>
<p>這麼着，我不斷地，每個時刻地在這條走不完的忽平忽險的路上踏着，那目的還不過是爲了生活，爲了避免掉飢寒的鞭子盡端地把我鞭笞，那麼，還有像小孩子的時代一樣做夢的勇氣和機會嗎？</p>
<p>所以，當我躺下那跟自己一樣蹩脚的帆布床的時候，牠的陳舊而破裂的劈拍的聲息好像有意警吿我一樣，又好像太息似地哀求。不過，我因爲這樣的旅途給我飢寒的滋味已達到極深的程度，自己的不斷的奔波跟跳躍以後，得到這個機會躺下來，躺在破壞的帆布床上面的時候，我還有什麼心情來管牠也是淪於不幸的環境里呢？當然，牠的破壞的太息似的劈拍聲，我只當牠是跟我的夜里的生活混在一起，我越是轉輾，越是不能够安寗地睡去，牠就越是劈拍劈拍的響個不停的，當然，等到牠已沒有氣力把我乘得起的時候，我才擺開地躺在水門汀的地板上。</p>
<p>躺在水門汀的地板上跟躺在破壞的帆布床上一樣，我永遠是一樣的想着白天的奔波，想着怎麼可以避免了飢寒。然而，地面靜靜的沒有反響的聲息了。</p>
<p>到了明天，我又得帶着空空的心情爬有高嶺，飄着海洋。</p>

<p>— 魏中天</p>
<p>綠的原野，綠的天空、綠的枝頭，綠的天……</p>
<p>春天早經去得那麼遠遠地，春天留下了這綠的世界，到處都是一片碧綠、一片蔚藍，若不是想到生活的担子一天比一天重的話，這景色多少總會使人得點愉快的。</p>
<p>初夏的風，吹起了我好多回憶，這些回憶，一半惹人愛，一半也惹人恨。……</p>
<p>東京自從夏天來到以後，社會上就多了二種使人注目的東西，那就是女人的雨傘同紙扇，日本女人的雨傘實在是很講究的，有紅色的，綠色的，有花紋的、有紫藍色的，各種各樣都有，我以前沒有看見過，我相信有些人看見這雨傘，也許會聯想到女人靑春之艷麗吧。六月的太陽照在那紅色的雨傘下的少女，似乎更顯得美麗，許多人都說，日本的美麗少女太多了。</p>
<p>至若那紙扇也是很講究的，又小巧，又玲瓏，看起來總覺得有一種特別的風味似的。——異國的情調呵。</p>
<p>初夏的風吹得人有點倦倦的，使人感到日子的悠長，生活的疲倦。在上海，此刻大槪很熱了吧，而在東京天氣還不熱，風還是那麼溫柔的掠過你的臉，並沒有想到夏日之可畏。現在蟬聲還沒有，而蚊子却一天一天的多起來了。</p>

<p>— 柳湜</p>
<p>也許是嗜好有些流罷，記得到過一平湖秋月一的人總愛誇張那裏出賣的五香豆腐乾可口，但在我却並不如此。我吃不出它那所謂一可口」來。這大概是我吃它時沒有配上一杯眞的龍井，沒有開上一壺一九溪十八澗」的水，沒有一個古瓷的杯子，盛着的緣故罷！不！不僅沒有這些，大概也還缺乏一個窗明几靜像知堂先生那樣的苦雨齋一，那橡的一顆閑適的田園的心，以及二三能品茗辨味的高士罷！吃，在我們這類俗人，大半就是飽肚皮，舌條的辨味力以及臭覺，也許都比高人要低能一些的。所以我愛吃的豆腐乾却反是一種天天在街頭可以買到的臭豆腐。花了兩個銅子，站在油鍋邊，用絲竹篾往鍋內籤它一塊，加上一點辣醬，熱辣辣往口內送，我到感覺十分開味兒。若荷包內能有一兩個銀角，買它十塊八塊回到家內下夜飯，那不就是窮人無上的肴　麼？至於衛生與否，那到從未考校過，因爲吃了半生，却從來沒有得過什麼惡疾，就不科學的權當它不妨害衛生罷！是的，在沒有到「平湖秋月」的幸運，沒有閑適的心情細嚼五香衛生豆腐乾的福氣以前，暫時不要打倒這些賣臭豆腐的担子罷！我個人是這般的想。</p>
<p>不過，這些賣臭豆腐的担子却會觸犯「高級嗜味一的人的鼻孔，這是無足怪的。</p>
<p>知堂先生對「現今嚷嚷的科學小品」就比作「所謂衛生臭豆腐』，這是說臭豆腐是本不衛生的，現在加上「衛生」二字，這不是矛盾得幽默麼？但何不要以爲知堂先生就反對科學小品，這猶如知堂先生不反對豆腐干一樣。知堂先生反對的只是「現今嚷嚷的」，他對英國懷德的「色耳彭自然史」，法國法布耳的「昆蟲記」，湯木生的「動物生活的秘密」都愛慕得很，並慨　「却又不是四庫的那一部文選所能我得出的，眞是難能希有也」。「我們如想有點科學小品看看，還得暫時往外國去借。」難這說知堂先生還反對科學小品麼？是的，同一豆腐干有的可以供雅人品茗，有的亦能給　頭人飽　，知堂先生反對的明明是不能供苦雨齋座談的那種科學小品，也是明量的。</p>
<p>「所謂科學小品不知到底是什麼東西，據我想這總該是內容說科學而有文章之夢者。」雖然這在大體上的像說明了什麼，其實是朦朧的。科學小品在今日的意義上，不能是這樣抽象的東西，它若是用科學的　解釋當　實踐觀象的科學的片斷的文字，自然，要將科學的眞理表達得充分，文字是大衆的，有誘惑力的文藝性作品。所以，雖然法布耳，湯木生的傑作値得尊爲五香衛生豆腐干，但在今日的中國，客觀的要求上，却只是供學者座談或作者研究的東西，並不能飽街頭的空肚子。目前需要的科學小品，不能是借人家的光，而是運用科學法則去解　壓在每一個人頭上的現象，這些觀　當壓迫我們緊的是屬社會的，所以專寫昆蟲動物生活的東西，縱令如何優美，在現在也只是茶食，不是正餐。「畫過幾筆墨梅的文士，」爲什麼一定」要去明撰文藝復興的名畫」呢？中國科學小品就不能依存於自己的實踐去創造麼？</p>
<p>至於說不像法布爾那樣的科學家，沒有那樣的文字手段的人，就「應該免動尊手」這不明明是取消人們的努力麼？這在我是不致領敎的。說來可憐，所謂「現今咦嚷的科學小品」，還只在孩童時期，沒有好的貨色，却也是事實，但是在趨勢上明明看出是在生長中的。因爲生活的實踐已决定它的發展無論在內容或形上，都不能成爲雅人學士的苦齋品品茗的五香豆腐干，所以只能權當作「臭豆腐」而在街頭叫賣吧！所以知堂先生這種諷刺我們點，也不認爲刻毒，難受。倒是把科學小品那種高貴的外衣脫下了。</p>
<p>在街頭販賣的東西就可以不備衛生麼？那倒不然，臭豆腐倒底是一個諷刺的比喻，科學小品者要嚴防的是帶有毒素，不僅對於臭的要留心，就是香甜也得注意啊！香的東西也一樣能有毒的。所以，臭豆腐上加了衛生二字，實在妙不可醬油了。</p>

<p>— 德國施托謨著陳隱之譯</p>
<p>此時我才發現娜麗今晚穿着一套淺出有花的羊毛衣服。這同以前那套一樣，大概也是從市長夫人衣櫉裏出夾的，因爲去年冬天市長夫人底闊胸和紫銅面色，配着這套有顏色的玫瑰花衣服，竟引起別人有點滑稽的感覺。但現在這種花式恰正當行；鮮艷而褐色的女孩子面孔同這套衣服配得十分合式。</p>
<p>『瑪茲卡舞』跳完了娜　讓她那　頭和一雙瘦臂又垂了下來，我送她到她的坐位去。弗里茨和夏綠蒂也剛從舞塲退出來，恰坐在我們近旁。恰在此時，波力嘉太太拿着糕餅和茶也走了來；她沒有同她的女兒說話，祇拿微笑而驕傲的眼光看她一眼，彷彿表示在那位高貴小姐面前敬過茶餅之後還要敬她一樣。高貴小姐用她那特有的疏懶神氣已經把這母女二人人看了好一會了。「你的女兒今晚漂亮得很，波力嘉太太！」她說，同時把糖放進茶杯裏面去。</p>
<p>這位受人恭維的太太謙和地行了一個禮，「謝謝小姐，這也是受了市長夫人照應的。」</p>
<p>『呵哈！—原來如此！那套玫瑰花衣服！」她就用個長眼光向娜麗飄去。娜麗要回看她，但眼晴已經昏暗暗了；我看見一雙淚珠怎樣從她面頰滾將下來。</p>
<p>夏綠蒂好像沒有看見；她的注意力轉向那開着的門口：我吃了一驚，因爲我看見法國裁縫底黃面孔也在孔羣旁觀的伊役中間現出來了。他似乎是很高興的，那個鼻烟壺在他乎裏翻來覆去。他的黑眼睛很歡喜地向大堂裏面看。</p>
<p>「這是您的父親麼，娜麗小妣？」夏綠蒂指着門外說。</p>
<p>雷娜麗看了出去，不覺全身震。「母親」她喊，不知不覺抓着那還在我們面前敬客的老太　底臂膀。</p>
<p>波力嘉太太此時也看見她那高興得手舞足蹈的丈夫了，她並不高興，她卻提起精神出來。『他是從客棧來的，」她說，「他是來看你跳舞的。」</p>
<p>娜麗向門口走去，我也不知不覺跟着她定去；當她走近門邊時，市長已經走到她的父親面前，請他進大堂來喝一杯糖酒。但裁縫不肯移步。「謝謝您，我是您的忠順的奴僕啊，市長先生！」他說，同時把背灣下來，向後退了一步。「但願我能像我那在路易十六宮廷當差的祖父一樣啊！我是很知道我的身份的！」</p>

<p>— 宸</p>
<p>最近中國紙板廠同業聯合會，呈文蘇省府，請取締各地惜字會，這一篇呈文，從營業者的口中說出來，自然是「革除陋習，而惜物力」的大道理，裏面或者還包含不少的「生意經」；不過敬惜字紙」這回事，因其本身原來就是「拜物狂」的一種性質，確乎早就應當得到人們的抨擊。只因我國歷來一種奇怪的思想，說方塊字是聖賢的遺跡，凡係「斯文同骨肉」的人，都應敬之惜之，禱拜之，否則有凟聖賢，該遭天譴以前蒼頡所造下來這語言工具的「文字實在意料不到會被後來的「讀書人一，當作一種可以「鎮魔壓邪」的東西。</p>
<p>這些方法除了竭力咬文嚼字以賣弄玄虛之外，敬惜字紙」也是他們法實之一。觀乎以前「讀書人之對於字紙，不僅不能隨地拋擲，而且還須聚而焚燒，投灰於海，絕對不是爲了淸潔衛生，實在是與「左道奇門」的人之詭秘自己符咒印訣的行徑毫無差異。前者是「妖言惑衆」，後者則爲愚人炫已。</p>
<p>從中國紙板廠同業聯合會的呈文，使我們看到我國社會中還有這種潛勢力。政府從而取締之，固爲革除舊俗迷信的快舉，可是我們還有進一步的願望，卽如何設法打破少數「讀書人的迷信，因爲歷史昭示我們，這一怪事，不僅是產生許多罪惡，且於國家民族亦有不小的關係。</p>
<h3 id="c236">眼鏡 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 戈白</p>
<p>最先彷彿有位電影明星在公共塲所戴上一付墨晶眼鏡，現在的摩登女郎已是人各一付，成了普遍的現象了。在上海，影星們總是佔風氣之先，戴墨眼鏡又是時髦的風尚吧。</p>
<p>讀彈詞小說，知道中國老早有「單照」這東西的，現在的英國太太却是改用「雙照」罷了。那種看人的態度總是欠大方的。但是改成了眼鏡這樣式，鼻子和耳朵在開始時候却受到一種意外的拘束，況且橫制里躥出一個人來的時候，在眼鏡邊綠上看起來，近乎一座泰山壓近前來一樣，往往有些手足無措自己不幸也悉了極度的近視，記得在中學讀書時侯，我的坐位漸漸由後排而移最近一排，但是黑板的字老是那樣遙遠，要把自己的上下眼皮合成一條綫，才辨出一點糢糊的輪廓來。配置一付眼鏡老早就拒了的，同學中間也多着戴眼鏡的，却總不願意鼻子和耳朵被那種堅硬的東西夾起來。後來一位理科教員，他對於眼球下了很詳細的說明，擔心着自己將來瞎眼睛，偷偷地配置了一具，但是下課的時候還是裝進衣袋里去。這因爲有一層更大的理由在內。</p>
<p>那時候戴眼鏡是被認爲時髦人物的，讀過章回小說的總不會忘了當一位風流瀟灑的小生出場的時候，作者在他的面部上不至少寫一付金絲邊眼鏡；卽是後來風行一時的「啼笑因緣，」據說作者更把一付眼鏡和一枝墨水筆作爲鳳喜變卦的伏筆。這漂亮的妝飾品一旦在我的鼻樑上發現時豈不担心着自己也是個風流人物嗎？而且同學們决不會放過你的，在向你「戴上了眼鏡嗎？」那種特具的態度，顯然諷刺你是學時髦了。那末自已的鼻子和耳朵在犧牲之餘，再把自己的背脊都冒着冷汗，你說少看見一點事物，未始不是件快事吧？而且處世藝術是以不見不問爲最高秘訣的！至於後來終於架到鼻樑上來，實在是說不出的痛苦；起初看不見東西的時候，是可以把上下眼皮合攏來的，旣藉了那層凹坡璃的力量帮助我眼球不足之後，卽使從前以爲看得很淸楚的時候，也不禁從衣袋中取出來架到鼻樑上希望看得更淸楚一點。久而久之，，習慣成自然，人家問我「戴了眼鏡嗎？」我能別解他是同情我而發問的，我自然泰然答之：「近視！」</p>
<p>不過無論托力克，克羅克，玻璃片總是取白色的。教員在考試時架了墨晶眼鏡，不免被學生罵一聲「刻毒鬼」算命先生戴了黑眼鏡，大家知道他是個瞎子，而新嫁娘是公認有這權利的。從前大姑娘怕羞，在那末許多人鬧洞房的時候，她可以借兩塊黑坡璃避去那些輕薄的目光。其他墨晶眼鏡的銷路是微乎其微了。</p>
<p>去年夏天在廣吿知道有一種鏡外鏡的發明，廣吿上最動人聽聞的字句是可以「保護目光」但是先閉上眼睛想一想，夏天戴眼鏡已經是最苦的事，一付之不足，再套上一付，卽使的鼻子和耳朵不怕犧牲，額角上有汗珠潦下來的時候，不是太費手脚？雖然自己眼球不爭氣，這種說來是善意的腰迫似乎太甚吧！</p>
<p>現在黑眼鏡風行一時了，爲了自己不願意多一筆出賬去配置一具同樣深度的墨晶近視鏡，我總不贊成要避免強烈的太陽光祇有這種辦法，如果是學時髦，自然是例外。</p>
<h3 id="c237">竊案 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 平</p>
<p>上海房租之高貴，似乎母庸多說的了。雖然現在市面上十室九空，但是租價始終不肯「在跌賤賣」，於是所謂「石庫門」房子裏像猪欄似的滿坑滿谷住着人。自己是低級薪給生活者，毫無異議地是那些猪欄中的主顧。然而那一襲維持我們長衫階級特種生活的舊西服，總受到同居者異樣地注意：這包含着兩種意義，一種是嫉妬，這確使我萬分慚愧。在這大都市中雖然是以衣服的高下來區別這個人的分量的，但同居在猪欄中的一羣，等於在澡堂中赤裸了父母淸白之體，無分貴賤的。另一種—說得過分一點，或許是貧婪吧？其實亦由羨慕，嫉妬而來的。人類本來天賦有向上心，一個舊笑話中曾告訴我們有一個乞丐希望做皇帝，所不同的就是：有的一步步的向上爬；有的想一脚升天。在猪欄羣中的，自然是屬於上一類的。那末，在他們理想中的長衫階級，得值得由嫉妬而貪婪了。不過使我早晚不安的就在這兩種目光中，一方面我已被擠於高貴之流，他方面我幻想到了或許有不利的事情發生，結果果屬神經過敏，搬家之心却日益逼切了，</p>
<p>我開始請託朋友，因爲想從「召租」上發見一所我理想的安身之新希望是太渺茫了，同一類的長衫階級或者有相當的帮助。在半個月前，那樣稱心如意地搬家了。新居是一所大宅子，總之是超乎一切普通石庫門之上的，而且直接受租於大房束，租價少一個中間人的漁利，不致使我十分吃虧。是一間寬大的廂房，向南，陽光，空氣俱臻上乘，此外門戶底謹慎，一切電話等設備，都使我戚覺到自己是向上爬一層了。</p>
<p>然面不利的事情却會在新居中發生。一天早上起來，當我要穿衣服的時侯，我發見我的眼鏡卡片及一切瑣碎的紙條，都從衣袋中搬到衣架旁的帽籠蓋上，三襲西服中最新的一套不翼而飛了。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>這消息傳出之後，同居者異口同聲地說；「這里幾十年來沒有失竊過東西」！這話我是十分信任的，當初介紹人的朋友曾提到這一層，他推薦新居的種種的時候。但在幾十年後那一天突吿失竊，似乎關於我的命運底什麼了。</p>
<p>統計損失是新西服一襲，派克水筆一枝，及現銀四五元，我最重要的近視眼鏡及一張保單，感謝他都仔細地爲我安置在帽寵上了。現在如果一下子要去置辦的話，亦有六十元之鉅。</p>
<p>當時是議論紛紛，驚奇這次處女竊案，好在我不想追究，不然未免顯出自家的酸氣了：而且許多與我無關係的人反終日不安着　至此，我不由地不信命運的看了，　初想從猪欄羣中跳出來，一則我慚愧被目爲高貴之流，第二層就恐怕有更窮的人轉我窮光蛋的念頭：自己先存了卑鄙之心，這次失竊，似乎是咎由自取了，或者竟是報應，那多說些什麼呢？</p>

<p>蒼芒的黃昏，慢慢的籠罩下來。幽雅淸秀的花園內，花木輕柔閒靜的微掘着。給花本圍住的高巍幽秀的洋樓，悄悄的沉轉若，週遭是浸在甜蜜溫淸的氣氛裏。但國內這部嶄新一的黑色汽車‘內的車夫阿福，他剛才目送着主人們那種歡聚的夫妻母子間的溫柔的言笑、親密的互携的下車去，路着輕鬆的步調，像快樂的小　　似的閃進屋子裏，過那佳節夜晚的情景、良久還呆住着。酸軟無力的手兒、仍默默掘住開車的轉盤；沉落的目光，滿含着無限的憂傷悵鬱的神容。</p>
<p>夏天的傍晚的凉風、陣陣飄起，掠過輕搖的花木，吹到他的胸前來，他更禁不住心的顫動跳亂，溫柔凉爽的風，吹着快樂的人們是最甜適不過的；但這於阿福，却只是撩亂心情而已。</p>
<p>飄起主人們那快樂的影子，便立刻會相映的泛浮凄凉的自家的屋子內，那淸瘦焦灼、憂愁的妻的臉容，使自己的心頓然更像給重石壓着般、腦筋給更多的東西刺痛着—房租，飯錢、零賬等等的債主；而且，今晚是該快樂的佳節呵！人們都回家去過節了，獨遺下孤冷冷，說不定會埋怨得流淚的妻，遺落著自己這麼一顆痛苦焦迫的心。</p>
<p>「怎麼老不發薪水給你呢？一月二月，三個月了！你自己怎麼這未糊塗？他們有錢人、難道少了你這幾塊零錢，你自己想想，讓我們母子挨餓……唉唉，難道你是死人…爲什麼不向他們要呢？……哼，怕是自己拿去嫖堂子了！」而妻那帶哭帶駡的無情的聲音又鞭擊着他的心使他更冒火了！眞是天曉得、他們有錢人怎麼會少了我這車夫的幾塊錢薪水呢？一述三個月不發。妻還怨着，以爲錢領了多去嫖了呵！阿福想起這些，那握住轉盤的手，不住的向胸部挺着，胸部像要裂開來。</p>
<p>「那裏會少了幾塊零錢呢這又使他想起今天去那大醫院接少爺回來的情形了。少爺爲端端的偷懶上學，說是，喉嚨不大舒服，這才天曉得！不知道他是怎麼醫的，在醫院住了五天，今天老爺便交了一千元支票。太太那兩隻狗，一醫也就那麼七八十塊，阿福三個月的勞苦的代價還沒這麼多呢！還一點也不發給。今天鼓起勇氣，乘老爺發還那七十五元的獸醫費時，大胆的開口了，老爺却有點不舒服的看着他：「沒零錢、向太太拿、我不管這些瑣屑事！」這麼一個釘子，他忍耐的吞下去。下午等了老半天、找不到向太太開口的機會；直到客人散了，太太正獨個兒忙着自己的晚裝、和給少爺整理衣服，吩咐娘姨這個那個，阿福才偷偷進去，低聲的向太太說：「太太、借幾個……」太太沒等他說完、回過頭猛喝他一下：「什麼？」反倒把他呆住了！又才吃吃的接上：「請太太借幾個錢：」太太顯得非常厭煩？「明天！」</p>
<p>又是一個明天，使他不得不退出去，仍舊落在憂焦如焚的迫亂中。洋樓內那歡樂的過節的佳景，只更剩着他，使他渾身不安……。</p>

<h3 id="c240">畢蘇斯基奮鬥史（上） <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— 難</p>
<p>波蘭民族英雄畢蘇斯基上將軍的死，引起全世界的悲悼，蓋將軍偉大的人格，和爲國家民族艱苦奮鬥的精神，確値得人類的景仰，本月三日上午十時半，南京中央大學於舉行總理紀念週時，特請波蘭駐華公使魏登壽氏演講畢將軍的生平，魏氏恂恂有學者態度，與吾國學術界狠多往還，中波友誼築在文化學術上，故愈久愈密，這當然要歸功於魏使的努力，現在把魏使的演辭，撮要紀述下來，因爲我國目下環境，正需要全體國民爲自由復興而掙扎奮鬥，畢將軍的一生，就是我們最好的模範，波使演辭之要點日，我今日在孫總理紀念週中致辭，深覺此不謀而合之機會，殊屬難得，蓋此東西兩大偉人，其生平，功績，成功，和學說，實有極相似之點，兩氏均爲其國家犧牲一生，且均由幼年起開始爲改造其國家而奮鬥，作繼續不斷的努力，同時兩氏均獲兩國國民至高深之愛戴也，畢蘇斯基上將軍爲波蘭的改造者，爲波蘭全民族的導師，余今日所講的，爲將軍一生奮鬥的縮圖，其無窮盡的困難，無數量的阻力，始造成今日的將軍。</p>
<p>童年時的環境，於人們一生事業的成功，有最大的影響，將軍幼時，目擊波蘭受異族種種慘痛的壓迫，甚至不能自由作波蘭國語的談話，將軍的父親，更爲一眞摯的愛國志士，在將軍降生前數年，參加一八六三年革命獨立運動，故其家庭間充滿最高而忠實的愛國精神，將軍飽受薰陶，築成極穩固的來日成功基礎，將軍初入小學，校中强迫講述俄語，不准用波蘭語，在校數年，種植了將軍恢復祖國江山的秧苗，及長入大學，遂與少數波蘭同學秘密組織政治團體，與波蘭壓迫者的帝俄，開始實際抗爭，將軍愛國志切，初未計及前途困難和危險，未幾，將軍終以反俄，被大學開除學籍，此爲將軍首次遭遇的難關，然將軍之氣不少餒，仍努力爲自由而奮鬥，積極向最困難的路途邁進，亟返其威爾諾故里，集合靑年同志，予以主義的訓練，積極進行革命工作，乃益遭俄政府的忌恨，不久就被捕，判處徒刑五年，流放西伯利亞，帝俄主政波蘭凡一百二十五年，波蘭志士被流配西伯利亞者先後達數千人，當時將軍僅爲一二十歲的靑年。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Song Zheyuan Leaves Chahar for Tianjin; Expresses Full Obedience to Central Government Orders; Qin Dechun's Inauguration Date Undecided; Japanese Military Officers Confer on Countermeasures Against Chahar <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) This morning at 8:00 AM, Song Zheyuan, accompanied by Military Affairs Commission members Men Zhizhong and Chief of Staff Wei Lantian, arrived in Beiping by express train from Suiyuan. As Beiping had not received prior notice, no one was there to greet them at the station. After disembarking, Song returned to his private residence and declined to see guests due to severe back pain. He will proceed to Tianjin in the afternoon for treatment and recuperation. Song expressed four points: 1. He will henceforth obey all orders from the central government. Now that the central government has dismissed him from his post, he believes he should leave Chahar as soon as possible. 2. Regarding military affairs, his back pain has worsened and he needs medical treatment in Beiping and Tianjin. Therefore, he has entrusted the 28th Division Commander Zhang Zizhong to take over responsibility. 3. Regarding the so-called Zhangbei Incident negotiations, the Chahar Provincial Government already has someone responsible and should consult the central government at any time to negotiate everything. 4. Chahar has always adhered to the principle of "we will not attack unless attacked." In the future, we should strive for peace and stability. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qin Dechun returned to Zhangjiakou by special train at 12:30 AM on the 19th to meet with Song and discuss the aftermath of Song's dismissal. Before Qin's departure, Song received an urgent telegram summoning him, so he set off immediately. He had not yet received the National Government's order dismissing Song. He will comply with all orders from the central government. He has always followed Song and will advance and retreat with him. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A telegram from Zhangjiakou reports that Song Zheyuan left Chahar for Beiping and will come to Tianjin for recuperation after meeting with Wang Kemin. Military affairs in Chahar and the 29th Army are the responsibility of Zhang Zizhong, and political affairs are the responsibility of Qin Dechun. If local negotiations are possible, Qin will still talk with Matsui, the Japanese military liaison officer, and proceed in accordance with the central government's intentions. Before leaving, Song also instructed his subordinates to adhere to the principle of "we will not attack unless attacked" and maintain security throughout the province. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qin Dechun left Beiping by special train at 12:40 AM this morning and returned to Chahar. Before his departure, he reported his whereabouts to Song by telephone. Song and Qin agreed to meet in Kangzhuang. When Song and Qin's cars arrived in Kangzhuang at around 3:00 AM this morning, Song got out of his car and boarded Qin's car for a long conversation. After the conversation, Qin boarded his original car and went to Zhangjiakou. Song came to Beiping. It is said that Qin has been ordered to act as the chairman of Chahar Province and plans to stay in Zhangjiakou temporarily to handle political affairs. He will not come to Beiping and Tianjin for three to five days. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A telephone call from Zhangjiakou reports that Qin Dechun returned to Zhangjiakou at 9:00 AM on the 20th. Senior officials of the provincial government welcomed him at the station. Qin still went to the Civil Affairs Department to work. The date for him to take office as acting chairman of the province has not yet been determined. Zhangjiakou is as peaceful as ever. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It is rumored that Song Zheyuan plans to come to Nanjing for a report after the handover of political affairs in Chahar. He also plans to go to Sichuan to meet with Chairman Chiang for instructions. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Doihara arrived in Beiping from Tianjin tonight. Yu Jiaji, Secretary-General of the Political Readjustment Council, Zhu Shiqin, representative of the Military Affairs Commission, and others welcomed him at the station. After getting off the train, Doihara went to the Fuso Hotel to rest. It is said that he has no special mission here and plans to stay in Beiping for a while before returning to Tianjin. The date and location of the Zhangbei Incident negotiations and how to proceed have not been determined. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese side has decided to resolve the Zhangbei Incident as a local matter. Matsui has flown back to Tianjin from Changchun to report the results of the Changchun talks to Doihara. He will go to Beiping and then to Zhangjiakou within days to continue negotiations with Qin Dechun. (20th Dispatch) Matsui has arrived in Tianjin today. The date for him to come to Beiping and return to Chahar has not been determined. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Doihara and Matsui went to Beiping from Tianjin this afternoon. Hearing that Song Zheyuan had arrived in Beiping from Zhangjiakou, they rushed there, intending to meet Song of Chahar before meeting Wang Kemin. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Doihara will invite important Japanese figures in Beiping tomorrow morning to discuss countermeasures for the Zhangbei Incident negotiations. Since both China and Japan advocate a local solution to this problem, representatives from both sides may gather in Zhangjiakou within days to discuss it. It is said that the Japanese Kwantung Army sent a telegram to Doihara on the 18th, and Doihara will base his negotiations with the Chahar Provincial authorities on that telegram. Now that the situation in Chahar has changed slightly, this matter can be resolved peacefully. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) It is confirmed that Sakai Takashi, Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army in Tianjin, returned to Tianjin from Shenyang by Japanese plane on the afternoon of the 19th. On the morning of the 20th, Commander Umezu, Lieutenant General Banzai, Special Agent Chief Doihara, Military Liaison Officer Matsui, and Senior Staff Officer Oki gathered at the Japanese Concession Haiguang Temple Barracks to listen to Chief of Staff Sakai's plan for resolving the Chahar issue decided in Changchun. After the meeting, Doihara went to Beiping in accordance with the Kwantung Army's policy to talk with Wang Kemin after his arrival. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Doihara, Chief of the Special Service Agency of the Kwantung Army stationed in Shenyang, and Matsui, the Japanese military liaison officer stationed in Chahar, left Tianjin together at 4:00 PM on the 20th and took the Beining Railway train to Beiping to wait to meet Wang Kemin. Doihara will go to Zhangjiakou to visit Qin Dechun with Matsui if necessary. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan went to Tianjin by car at 1:30 PM. Doihara arrived in Beiping from Tianjin at 6:42 PM on the 20th. It is said that Matsui has arrived in Tianjin, and the location of the Zhangbei Incident negotiations has not been determined. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan arrived in Beiping with his entourage at 8:30 AM this morning. Song declined to express his opinions, but it is generally expected that he will go to Tianjin, as Song has a mansion in the British Concession in Tianjin. The Chahar incident is unlikely to change. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Matsui, the Japanese military officer stationed in Chahar, recently consulted with senior officials of the Kwantung Army in Changchun. He has now returned here.

From noon on the 13th to 6:00 PM on the 15th, after two days and nights of fierce fighting, more than 2,000 bandits were killed, and more than 1,000 guns were seized. On the night of the 15th, both bandit Xiao Ke and the bogus Tenth Division Commander were seriously injured. Bandit He led the remnants in a desperate flight. The National Army is still pursuing and suppressing them in separate routes. (20th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e42">Signing of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— Ang</p>
<p>The Anglo-German Naval Agreement has been signed. This is a concrete manifestation of British nationalism and a preliminary success of Hitler's pro-British and anti-Russian diplomacy. A strong nation plans for itself. Its response to fundamental issues related to its own safety must have an independent and unwavering approach. It is never willing to easily accommodate the intentions of other countries. Today, Britain disregards the criticism of France and Italy and reaches a compromise with Germany alone, which can be seen in this light. The circumstances of this negotiation are similar to the failure of the Geneva Naval Conference in 1927, after which Britain negotiated separately with France, a move that was greatly suspected by Germany and the United States. The only difference is that this negotiation is related to the existence of military clauses in the Treaty of Versailles.</p>
<p>Britain only considers its own interests and has repeatedly accommodated Hitler's abrogation of the Treaty of Versailles. Whether this is right or wrong is not discussed here. Here, we only make a general review of the direct relationship between Britain and Germany. Germany's revival is actually beneficial to Britain in terms of economy. In terms of military preparedness, the threat felt by Britain is no less than that felt by France, Russia, and other countries. This can be seen from the recent urgent passage of the bill to expand the British air force to 1,500 aircraft. First, let's talk about the army. Germany's restoration of conscription poses less of a threat to British defense than to France and Russia. Because the British military front line, with the guarantee of the Locarno Treaty, has progressed from the Netherlands and Belgium to east of the Rhine. Hitler's recent diplomatic declaration also strongly emphasized his commitment to complying with the treaty. Land security can be worry-free.</p>
<p>As for the navy and air force, the harm of naval competition before the war and the fear of Zeppelin airship raids on London during the war are not far away. Britain cannot help but feel a direct sense of danger. Now, the naval issue has been compromised by allowing Germany a tonnage of 35%. The only thing left to negotiate is the air force. Baldwin has repeatedly mentioned the conclusion of an air force convention to supplement Locarno. The new Foreign Secretary Hoare also told the House of Commons yesterday that the government is carefully considering this matter and is well aware of its urgency. It should exchange views with relevant countries, and so on. Therefore, the main issue in Britain's future international negotiations with Europe will be the conclusion of an air force convention.</p>
<p>Since the Washington Conference, the attitudes of the five naval powers, Britain, the United States, Japan, France, and Italy, have formed two factions. France and Italy are the continental faction, advocating that naval issues be discussed jointly with general armament issues, which is different from the United States and Japan, which advocate that naval issues can be resolved independently. Britain maneuvers between the two, and as long as it does not violate its so-called "necessary" conditions, it can be resourceful on both sides. The so-called necessary conditions for the British navy are that, globally, its naval power should be equal to the world's strongest naval power, and it must have at least 50 light cruisers to maintain maritime traffic. In Europe, its navy should be equal to the combined fleets of any two continental countries. This is the established policy of the British navy, and it does not matter by what means this goal is achieved.</p>
<p>Britain has now compromised with Germany and has notified France, Italy, the United States, and Japan of the results. The United States and Japan still maintain a proportional system with Britain and Germany. Although their views are different, they are happy to agree because it is purely a European issue. In their replies, France and Italy still insisted on their original attitude of discussing land, sea, and air together and expressed opposition to the separate compromise between Britain and Germany. However, the issue of naval equality between France and Italy is still pending. From this perspective, after the Anglo-German compromise, the trend of the European situation is likely to be nothing more than two paths. One is that the Stresa Front is likely to be broken, and the relations between countries will fall into a more complicated situation. The other is that countries may try to negotiate individually, leading to a general agreement and gradually promoting a collective peace system. According to recent news, the British government has sent Eden to Paris today to discuss the naval issue, and France, Italy, and Russia have also agreed to send naval experts to London to discuss it together. Therefore, the situation of international cooperation has gradually developed due to the establishment of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement.</p>
<h3 id="e43">British Diplomatic Activities: Eden Departs for Paris to Dispel French Concerns on Naval Issues and Promote the Organization of Peace and Security <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>(London) Minister without Portfolio Eden departed for Paris at 4:30 PM today. Before leaving, he was given detailed instructions by the cabinet to explain the reasons for the Anglo-German Naval Agreement to the French government and to dispel the concerns of the French, who are deeply concerned about whether the principle of cooperation among Britain, France, and Italy stipulated in the Anglo-French Declaration of February 3 and the subsequent Stresa Conference can be maintained in the future. After arriving in France, Eden will first exchange views on naval issues and propose to convene a conference of British and French naval experts. It is generally speculated that the most important goal of Eden's visit to France is to promote the negotiation of the Western European Air Mutual Assistance Pact so that it can be held as soon as possible, because the Western European Air Pact is directly related to Britain. As for the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Pact, although German leader Hitler believes that it is in conflict with the obligations of the Locarno Pact, the British government believes that it does not violate the Locarno Pact at all. It is generally believed that Britain has already notified the German naval representative Ribbentrop of this interpretation. (20th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Eden will meet with French Prime Minister Laval in Paris tomorrow for about two days. In addition to explaining the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and trying to eliminate French opposition, he will also focus on the issue of the Five-Power Air Force Convention. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) British Minister without Portfolio Eden is scheduled to leave for Paris tomorrow night. The length of his stay in France will depend on the situation. The purpose of Eden's trip is to explain the Anglo-German Naval Agreement to France and to explain that after the establishment of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, broader negotiations may be held on the topic of peace organization, and even Germany may return to Geneva. Regarding the issue of the Eastern European Pact, it is reported that after British cabinet members spoke with German Chief Representative Ribbentrop, Germany seemed to have expressed the possibility of first considering harmonizing the Eastern European Non-Aggression Pact and the Mutual Assistance Pact. Regarding the two issues of the Sky Locarno Pact and the restriction of Sky armaments, the current key point is to determine whether this pact should take a multilateral form, including all the signatory countries of the Locarno Pact, or whether only the signatory countries of the Locarno Pact should conclude bilateral treaties with each other. Britain advocates concluding a multilateral pact to define the obligations of various countries in the air force in accordance with the form of the Locarno Pact. Germany's attitude has not yet been decided, but according to what has been heard from the German delegation, Ribbentrop does not intend to negotiate a bilateral sky agreement with Britain, but advocates concluding a multilateral pact in accordance with the form of the Locarno Pact.

<h3 id="e44">Eden's Mission to France: Eastern European and Sky Pacts Resurrected; London Declaration Separately Seeks Solutions; Italian-Abyssinian Case Also Under Discussion <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>(London) The Anglo-German Naval Agreement is actually the first chapter of the British new cabinet's diplomatic action. Since the establishment of the Baldwin cabinet, it has engaged in large-scale diplomatic activities to make the European diplomatic situation take a sharp turn and move towards relaxation. In this way, the government can have a winning chance in the next parliamentary election and keep the national unity cabinet from falling. The first step of this diplomatic action is to conclude the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, and the second step is to send Minister without Portfolio Eden to France. The purpose is to establish the Eastern European General Pact, the Sky Locarno Pact, and the Air Force Restriction Treaty. After the establishment of the above-mentioned pacts, the last thing to do is to order Germany to return to Geneva. Apart from Europe, British diplomatic action also has a purpose, which is to prevent the war between Italy and Abyssinia. However, if you want to prevent the Italian-Abyssinian war, the prerequisite should be to obtain France's support. Therefore, the British cabinet specifically decided to order Eden to go to France to lobby the French government, saying that the British naval agreement is not only technically convenient for all countries, but also for France, and it is also a prelude to the establishment of a general reconciliation in the European continent and the establishment of lasting peace, and its benefits are innumerable. Moreover, Hitler has repeatedly expressed goodwill to Britain, and Britain should not reject people thousands of miles away. Based on past experience, negotiations on land armaments were held with Paris for a long time, but ultimately failed. It can be seen that multilateral negotiations on armament issues are not effective. According to what people generally hope, Eden will probably use this reason to lobby France to dispel France's doubts about the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, and then go further to realize the main purpose of British diplomacy. Eden will probably explain to the French government that Britain still firmly believes that the only way to achieve a general relaxation of the situation is to make the proposals in the London Declaration of February 3 a reality one by one. However, as far as the current situation is concerned, the British government believes that it is difficult to solve all the items listed in the London Declaration without dividing them. Therefore, for the sake of factual convenience, the proposals in the London Declaration have to be solved separately. British public opinion generally believes that after the establishment of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, the Sky Convention will be resolved first, but British diplomatic circles believe that this is not the case. British cabinet members and German representative Ribbentrop both advocate the establishment of the Eastern European Convention in the near future. Regarding the Eastern European Convention, Germany has repeatedly raised objections on legal grounds so far, saying that the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact and the Eastern European Multilateral Convention are actually in conflict. However, British cabinet members have strongly stated that the Eastern European Non-Aggression Pact proposed by Germany and the bilateral Mutual Assistance Pact are not impossible to reconcile. For this reason, when Eden goes to France, he will study the reconciliation methods of these two conventions with the French government, in order to establish the Eastern European Convention as soon as possible. Once the Eastern European Convention is established, the Soviet Union can rest easy. If so, the Soviet Union may consider no longer increasing its naval fleet in the Baltic Sea. If the Soviet navy increases again, Germany will invoke the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and will also demand to increase its naval tonnage again. This is also what Britain is trying to avoid.

<h3 id="e45">British Note to France: Endorsing French Reply to Germany; Mutual Assistance Pact Does Not Conflict with Locarno Pact <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) Germany has sent a note to the signatory countries of the Locarno Pact, stating that the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty conflicts with the obligations of the Locarno Pact. Regarding this matter, the British government recently sent a note to France, stating that the Mutual Assistance Treaty does not conflict with the Locarno Pact, and expressed its support for France's reply to Germany's note. Today, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval attended the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives, reported this note from Britain to the committee, and explained that the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty was originally the starting point for the conclusion of the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, and hopes that Germany and Poland can be included in it in the future. Laval then mentioned the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia, pointing out that there are no secret clauses in the Italian-French Rome Agreement of January 7 this year that allow Italy to act freely in Abyssinia. (19th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the Sky Locarno Pact and the Sky Armament Restriction Pact, it is generally believed that because the technical issues are extremely complicated, the establishment of an agreement between countries will be delayed. Although experts from various countries have studied it when the Council of the League of Nations met in Geneva last month, there has been no progress. Regarding the form adopted by this convention, there are currently three proposals: one is that the signatory countries of the Locarno Convention jointly conclude a multilateral convention, one is that the signatory countries of the Locarno Convention conclude bilateral conventions separately, and the other is to collect various bilateral conventions into a multilateral agreement. London believes that the obligation of sky mutual assistance should be limited to the signatory countries of the Locarno Convention, so it advocates concluding a multilateral convention. Therefore, it is expected that after Minister without Portfolio Eden goes to France, he will state to the French government that Britain cannot assume bilateral military obligations in the mainland, so the sky convention should be based on the Locarno Convention, and it is more appropriate to conclude a multilateral convention.

<h3 id="e46">Britain Acts Alone; France Expresses Deep Dissatisfaction; Laval Speaks Cautiously, Awaiting Explanation from British Representative <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) France's dissatisfaction with the Anglo-German Naval Agreement was also expressed at today's meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives, saying that the agreement violated the Treaty of Versailles. Prime Minister Laval explained the European situation at the time, admitting that the new agreement surprised him, and that this move violated the Anglo-French agreement in February, which aimed to prohibit both parties from recognizing the breach of the Treaty of Versailles. Laval spoke very cautiously about British Minister without Portfolio Eden's upcoming visit to Paris, without being conclusive. People in all walks of life in France now expect Eden to argue that when the Anglo-German Naval Agreement was signed, the clauses in the Treaty of Versailles regarding sky, land, and naval armaments no longer existed, because Germany had already unilaterally abolished them. Therefore, in this environment, it is better to sign a treaty with Germany to limit its naval power than to let it build ships freely to an unlimited extent. Eden may also explain that the combined strength of the British and French fleets can often defeat Germany in an emergency, because when Germany builds ships to the new limit, its tonnage will only be one-ninth of the combined tonnage of Britain and France. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee discussed the naval issue today. Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval made a statement that deeply impressed people here. Laval first said that Britain's cancellation of its obligations to Stresa and its direct establishment of a separate agreement with Germany is regrettable. Laval continued, saying that this action by Britain has given France the right to resume its completely free action, but in view of the fact that Sir Eden will soon come to France, we will remain silent for the time being and not discuss this issue in depth. It is reported that Eden will arrive in Paris today. (20th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Rome) Official sources today obtained confirmation that Mussolini will follow Britain's example in future international negotiations, acting directly without consulting the League of Nations. The Italian government believes that Britain's unilateral establishment of a naval agreement with Germany this time is the biggest blow to the League of Nations since Japan withdrew from the League of Nations. The British action has also tripled the German navy to 400,000 tons. Mussolini and the ministers believe that Britain should have consulted with the relevant countries on this issue first.

<p>(Rome) Italian newspapers are vying to report on the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. The tone of the newspapers overemphasizes the importance of Germany's restoration of its navy and criticizes Britain for acting arbitrarily before the time is ripe.

<p>(Rome) People here have harshly criticized the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, believing that this agreement (1) is contrary to the British, French, and Italian policy of contact determined at the Stresa Conference, (2) will affect all arms restrictions, and (3) according to the Anglo-German Agreement, Germany recognizes Britain's maritime hegemony, which means that Britain has restored its traditional policy on the European continent, in other words, it wants to use German naval tonnage to offset the naval tonnage of France, Italy, and Russia.

<p>(London) The German "pocket battleship" will still be classified as a battleship. This was decided today by British and German representatives when discussing technical issues at the Admiralty. Reclassification will have to wait for a future naval conference. Today, the German timeline and the types of various warships were also discussed. Judging from the situation, Germany seems to be planning to increase the construction of aircraft carriers. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Hitler's disarmament special envoy Ribbentrop met with British Prime Minister Baldwin at the Prime Minister's residence this morning for half an hour, after which Minister without Portfolio Eden also went to see Prime Minister Baldwin. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Nazi Party organ "People's Observer" published an article written by a naval expert, detailing the naval shipbuilding procedures that Germany will take in accordance with the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, which roughly states that the current total tonnage of the British Navy is 1,217,000 tons. According to this figure, the German Navy can account for 35% of Britain, which is 415,950 tons. Germany is now strictly adhering to the 35% ratio of all levels of warships in a reasonable and fair manner. Among them, the Washington Treaty, which is still valid, stipulates that each battleship is limited to 35,000 tons, but Britain advocates that the maximum tonnage of German battleships should be 25,000 tons. Germany has already agreed to this level. Germany currently has three 10,000-ton battleships (the so-called "Versailles type" pocket battleships). In addition to this, Germany can still build 153,750 tons of battleships, but the exact number to be built will depend on the maximum tonnage per ship to be specified in the future. Italy is currently building two 35,000-ton battleships, and France also plans to start building one this year. As for aircraft carriers, Germany plans to build two. The Anglo-German agreement stipulates that Germany can build 47,250 tons of aircraft carriers. The current naval treaty stipulates that the maximum tonnage of aircraft carriers is 27,000 tons, while the aircraft carriers built by Germany may be reduced to 22,000 tons each.

<p>Amsterdam The Dutch newspapers generally view the conclusion of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement as a victory for German diplomacy. The Dutch Daily commented that Britain, feeling it was more advantageous to deal directly with Germany, had abandoned the policy of appeasement. This sudden change in attitude is probably due to the difficulties Britain has encountered in its naval policy in Europe, which are not as concerning as those in the Far East, forcing Britain to resolve one issue first and shift its attention to the other. Moreover, in recent days, the situation in the Far East has become extremely tense. To protect the interests of the British Empire, Britain necessarily needs to resolve the European problem quickly. Therefore, from this point of view, Britain's change of attitude is very beneficial to the Netherlands, as the Netherlands also has pressing interests in the Far East. A Berlin correspondent for the Telegraph reported that Germany's international isolation is now a thing of the past. Germany's diplomatic victory is the result of Hitler's speech to the Reichstag making a good impression on Britain, and also the success of his advocacy of bilateral agreements to maintain a balanced policy. The People's Daily said that the question now is how Laval can recognize the current situation, seize the opportunity, and reach a compromise with Germany. (20th National News Agency)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Viewed from the perspective of the overall resolution of the European problem, and the only effective method of resolving it, the significance of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement is by no means limited to the benefits enjoyed by the signatory countries. This is what the Diplomatic and Political Review hints is the opinion of the German authorities. The newspaper also stated that it is particularly noteworthy that by using the method of free negotiation, the interests and defense of both countries are taken into account, and concrete disarmament is realized. Britain's maritime hegemony and Germany's naval protection of its coasts and the freedom to maintain traffic in its ports have been recognized. (19th National News Agency)</p>

<p>(Geneva) Perceptions of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement differ within the League of Nations, fearing that it may lead to a review of the results achieved at the Geneva Conference and new methods of direct negotiation between the two countries. It is generally believed here that the agreement will make it even more difficult for the Disarmament Conference to achieve any substantial results. The Geneva Daily stated that Germany has effectively obtained equal maritime rights. Britain differs from France in that it not only recognizes Germany's claimed equal rights in principle, but also fulfills its promise. (20th National Telegram)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Japanese naval circles are now paying close attention to the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun is particularly skeptical of Britain's plan to make the agreement a model for general naval limitations and its willingness to cooperate with the United States. It is evident that the United States still firmly adheres to the ratio method and classification restrictions. However, the newspaper stated that various countries now have strong objections to this method of restriction, fearing that France may confront Germany, leading to a naval arms race. (20th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The contents of the naval agreement concluded between the British and German governments were announced on the 18th. At the same time, the British Foreign Office sent it to Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira, requesting that it be transmitted to the Japanese government. The Japanese Foreign Ministry maintains the following view on the conclusion of the agreement: The Anglo-German Naval Agreement is a local European issue, and the 35% figure does not strengthen ratioism. Britain is attempting to use this local ratioism to limit the world's navies. We should pay close attention to its attitude with caution. The upcoming Anglo-French naval conference is also a European issue, but its importance is many times greater than the Anglo-German conference. The Anglo-German 35% ratioism has a great impact on the strength of French and German capital ships. France will definitely not acquiesce to this agreement. It is not difficult to imagine that Britain and France will compromise, and France will expand its navy.

<p>(London) Australian High Commissioner Bruce hosted a banquet today to bid farewell to Japanese Ambassador to Britain Matsudaira. British Foreign Secretary Hoare also attended the banquet. During the banquet, Bruce spoke, stating that in today's world, nothing deserves more attention than the Pacific, and the occurrence of various major problems in the future is likely to be in the Pacific. Therefore, he advocated that good relations should be maintained between Britain and Japan, and he deeply believed that the peace of the Pacific would depend on the relationship between Britain and Japan. After finishing his speech, British Foreign Secretary Hoare rose and deeply praised the maintenance of close relations between Britain and Japan, while acknowledging that there were indeed some difficulties. For example, the news coming from North China today is somewhat of an example of causing unease in the relations between the two countries. Finally, Matsudaira stood up and replied, stating that the good relationship between Britain and Japan has not been established in just one day. In recent years, due to various problems, the two countries have inevitably had misunderstandings and suspicions, but if sincerity and understanding can be shown, then any problem will be resolved sooner or later. (19th National News Agency)</p>
<p>(London) Japanese Ambassador to Britain Matsudaira will return to Japan in a few days. The Japanese Association held a special banquet tonight to bid farewell to Matsudaira and his wife. British Foreign Secretary Hoare was also one of the guests and gave a speech, saying that Britain views a just understanding and cooperation with Japan as an important means of ensuring the security of Asia and the prosperity of the world. He hoped that Matsudaira would tell his compatriots when he and his wife returned to their country, with the announcement of the British people, "We deeply know that we now have many things that are related to most of the world. We are both large island nations and still enjoy the unparalleled blessings of traditional monarchs. We are both brave nations and will leave our mark on the history of the world. If there are any difficulties, let us discuss them like friends who are eager to understand each other's opinions." The relationship between Britain and Japan, in recent times, has not been entirely free of disturbing factors. I will now only mention the information we have received from North China, and the difficulties that the two major industrial countries may encounter in conducting business in the world at any time. I hope Your Excellency will tell your countrymen that many men and women in Britain wish to see these difficulties eliminated. We dare to say that many men and women in Japan share this feeling. Matsudaira replied that the friendship between Britain and Japan has stood the test of time and remains as firm as tradition. In recent years, several problems have caused misunderstandings and unhappiness between us, but there are no difficult problems that cannot be resolved sooner or later with mutual goodwill and sincerity. Today, not only the Far East is unstable, but the whole world also presents this picture. This is indeed regrettable. Now, greater efforts are needed to eliminate misunderstandings between countries. This goal cannot be achieved solely through the efforts of diplomats and officials. Direct contact between countries is also necessary. Matsudaira further said that the International Cultural Association is currently discussing sending a university professor to Britain to lecture on Japanese art. He felt that a good understanding and friendship between Britain and Japan is essential to peace in the Far East. We must continue to make sincere efforts to seek this peace. Australian High Commissioner to London Bruce then declared that the place where the biggest problems in the world will occur in the future is probably in the Pacific, so a very happy understanding and harmonious relationship between Britain and Japan is essential.

<p>Brussels The president of the Association of Flemish War Veterans in Belgium issued a declaration to the Belgian and foreign press, opposing recent pro-French remarks in Belgium, stating that peace cannot be guaranteed by armaments and military alliances, but must rely on national understanding and the reduction of armaments. Therefore, the current Franco-Belgian military alliance must be abandoned. The defensive fortifications built by both sides and the implemented extension of military service law should be suspended immediately. He went on to say that the Association of Flemish War Veterans will launch a large-scale movement to oppose the Franco-Belgian military alliance and advocate that Belgium adopt a policy of voluntary neutrality. France has always regarded maintaining its superiority in the European army as its mission, and for a hundred years, it has always coveted the Rhineland, never diminishing. It is not a good way to ensure its own security for Belgium to conclude a military alliance with such a country, and if France can annex the Rhineland, then Belgium will inevitably be annexed by France.

<p>(Berlin) Germany is about to establish a fund for industrial dumping. Recently, all industrial and commercial enterprises in the country with a business volume of more than 20,000 marks have received confidential letters from various economic institutions, informing them that they must abide by the order of Economics Minister Schacht and pay 2% to 15% of their total business volume to form the dumping fund. As for the amount to be paid by major enterprises, it will be designated by the authorities. For example, the Chemical Industry Association, whose business volume last year was 5,650,000,000 marks, must pay as much as 50,000,000 marks. The announcement issued by various economic institutions stated that paying the fund is indeed a huge sacrifice for industrial and commercial enterprises, but "for the sake of Germany's economic interests, the supply of raw materials is necessary, and sacrifices must be made with pain."

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt today sent a special message to Congress, strongly advocating the levying of heavy taxes on the wealthy to equalize wealth and poverty. The President stated that he advocates a more widespread distribution of wealth in order to prevent unrest among American society, and stated that the United States must eventually simplify its corporate system through taxation. The first step should be to abolish useless holding companies in various industries. According to reports, the President's message greatly surprised most well-informed people. He also indicated that his opposition to holding companies is the starting point of a plan to equalize wealth and poverty. At the same time, he also strongly urged the amendment of the Constitution so that the federal government can issue securities to local governments in the future, and levy national taxes at the same time. Local governments can also levy local taxes on the securities issued by the federal government. The President also said that unrest in American society is becoming increasingly serious, so powerful methods must be used to reduce these dangers. People all know that the huge income of individuals is not only the result of talent and luck, but also greatly related to the opportunities given to them by the government. Therefore, it is only natural for the government to levy taxes to restrict them. Senator Long, who has always been the most enthusiastic supporter of wealth equalization plans, couldn't help but exclaim "Amen" when he heard the President's message today. Chairman Doughton of the House Ways and Means Committee said that the President requested that Congress be able to make a decision on his proposal during this session, so the Ways and Means Committee will consider it tomorrow. (19th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt sent a special message to Congress today, advocating increasing taxes, especially paying attention to large incomes, large estates, and corporate net profits. This message came suddenly and was unexpected by outsiders. Personal income tax will definitely increase greatly, and corporate net profit tax will also increase progressively, from 10.75% to 16.75%, to replace the current 13.75%. In addition to the existing property tax, President Roosevelt also advocated levying estate tax and inheritance tax, and in order to prevent tax evasion, he also advocated levying gift tax. President Roosevelt claimed that he is in favor of substantially increasing personal income tax on large incomes and said that a corporate net profit tax of 13.75% regardless of the amount of profit is an inappropriate measure for small-scale businesses and should be adjusted according to economic capacity. President Roosevelt also proposed amending the Constitution so that the central government can levy income tax on the bonds issued by various states or local governments in the future, and the states and local governments can also levy taxes on the securities issued by the central government in the future. This message also requested that Congress continue to approve the various emergency donations recently voted on by the House of Representatives. (19th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Washington) Most Democrats and some Republicans strongly supported the method of amending income tax advocated by President Roosevelt in his special message submitted to Congress this morning. However, a few opponents said that implementing this proposal would further hinder recovery. Senator Long, who has always been difficult with President Roosevelt, claimed today that he does not trust President Roosevelt's promises, but if President Roosevelt can break up the financial groups, then the United States can escape the recession within 24 hours.

<p>(Washington) The Social Security Act has been passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives, and will take effect once President Roosevelt signs it. Afterwards, in addition to agricultural workers and domestic servants, 25 million American elderly and unemployed people can receive monthly subsidies, ranging from ten to eighty-five US dollars per person. When the Act begins to be implemented, the required funding will be almost entirely taken from taxes. Later, employers and employees will donate funds separately each year, and the amount will increase year by year, reaching its maximum limit in 1950, but at most it will not exceed 300 million US dollars. Starting this July, destitute men and women in the United States aged 65 or older or who are blind, if they meet the prescribed conditions, can receive a monthly living allowance of 15 US dollars from the government. Starting in 1937, employers and employees nationwide should donate 1% of the wages earned by workers and deposit it into the National Old-Age Insurance Fund. This percentage of donations will increase year by year, and in 1949, both employers and employees should each pay 3% of wages. By 1950, the total amount of donations may reach 200 million US dollars. Companies that already have pension systems that have been approved by the government are exempt from paying this donation.

<p>(Washington) The House of Representatives recently passed the Labor Act proposed by Democratic Congressman Wagner, stipulating that labor-management disputes should be resolved through compulsory arbitration.

<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The rotation of Japanese troops in Beiping and Tianjin. Due to the tension over the Hebei issue, the new troops arrived as scheduled, but the old troops' return was delayed. Now that the situation has eased, the Japanese troops along the Beiping-Tianjin and Beining lines are being rotated starting from the 18th. The first batch of returning troops, consisting of 700 artillery soldiers stationed in Tianjin, received a farewell speech from Commander Umezu at the Haiguang Temple barracks at 6:30 a.m. on the 18th and then boarded the Beining Railway car to Tanggu. At noon, they boarded the Honghayabusa Maru transport ship to return home. On the same day, the second batch left Tianjin at approximately 9:00 a.m., also boarding cars to Tanggu and boarding ships to return home. The Japanese troops stationed in Beiping are scheduled to pass through Tianjin at 10:00 a.m. on the 19th and go directly to Qinhuangdao, joining 1,600 Japanese soldiers from Tanggu, Tangshan, Changli, Leting, and Yuguan to board the Imperial ship Minghai Maru to return home. It is expected that the transfer of the old troops will be completed on the 21st. The newly arrived Japanese troops consist of three battalions, one artillery unit, and one cavalry unit, with additional communication squads, logistics teams, and gendarmerie, totaling more than 2,400 troops. Except for the officers, who have not been changed, they have been transported to Beiping and Tianjin from Tanggu and Qinhuangdao between the 12th and 14th of this month and distributed to garrison locations. Tianjin is garrisoning 920 infantry, artillery, and cavalry soldiers, Beiping is garrisoning 380 infantry, cavalry, and artillery soldiers, Tanggu is garrisoning 450 cavalry, infantry, artillery, and logistics soldiers, and Tangshan is garrisoning 320 cavalry, infantry, and artillery soldiers. Changli, Aoxian, Haiyangzhen, Gubeikou, and Saheqiao are each garrisoning a small squad of approximately 40 soldiers. The rest are garrisoned in Qinhuangdao and Shanhaiguan. The new troops are selected from the Second, Seventh, and Twelfth Divisions and are known as elite troops in the Japanese army. Now that the rotation of Japanese troops in the Beiping and Tianjin area has been completed, a large number of Japanese troops have suddenly arrived at Shanhaiguan and Gubeikou on the Great Wall line. In Gubeikou alone, there are 8-9,000 troops from the Sugihara Battalion's Kawagishi Brigade stationed in Chengde. The streets of Gubeikou and the vicinity of the Eastern Tombs are full of Japanese military tents, with flags everywhere. Japanese troops are also stationed in the territories of Huairou, Miyun, and Shunyi counties. From the 16th, field exercises have suddenly been held in the Shunyi-Yanqing area. The Kawagishi Brigade's headquarters is located in Gubeikou. It is claimed that the exercises will last for one month. Residents along the border are anxious and restless, and those fleeing inland are coming in an endless stream. Several thousand Japanese soldiers have also newly arrived from the customs area. The East Luocheng and inns in the city are all full. The Linyu County Government and Public Security Bureau have also been occupied, and the county government has moved to Haiyangzhen to conduct its affairs. Electric nets and sandbags have been piled up near the Japanese military camp in Nanda Camp, and the situation is particularly tense. Fifteen military trains are stopped at Yuguan Station, each train with 20-30 freight cars, all fully loaded with Japanese soldiers. As of the 16th, two trains left Shanhaiguan and headed to Suizhong Station on the pseudo-Fengshan Road, while the remaining thirteen trains still show no sign of leaving. More than 20 Japanese aircraft are parked at the Yuguan Airport, conducting low-altitude reconnaissance along the Beining Line every day. No one can know what the intention of such a display is.

<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The former Bohai Fleet, after defecting to Guangdong, was reorganized into the Guangdong Naval Fleet in April of the 22nd year of the Republic. In the spring of this year, the Guangdong authorities detected a conspiracy and, as a precaution, reorganized the fleet again in April, simultaneously replacing the captains of the Zhaohua, Haichen, and Haiqi. Chen Jitang concurrently served as the Naval Commander, and the original fleet commander Jiang Xiyuan was changed to principal of the naval academy. Although the senior officers on the three warships were replaced after the reorganization, the latent influence in the warships remained. They inevitably felt a sense of shared sorrow over the replacement of officers and had thoughts of returning north from time to time, but because the time was not yet ripe, and the army and key fortresses were heavily guarded, recently, the Naval Headquarters, to unify salaries, changed the salaries of the Haiqi and other three warships to small silver dollars. The sailors of the three warships became more resentful and secretly discussed escaping. One theory is that the warships and others plan to go north to join the pseudo-organization. The plan was decided, so they set fire to the ships at 11 pm on the 15th, and departed from the Huangpu River. The nearby land defense forces, including Chen Yuguang's Second Special Operations Battalion of the Salt Police Team, Xie Songnian's Marine Training Camp, and a battalion of the Marine Special Operations Battalion, had been on guard against the three warships in advance. As soon as the Haiqi and others left, they were discovered by the sentries of the Salt Police Special Operations Battalion and reported to their superiors for instructions, while firing guns to stop them. The officers and soldiers on the warships also returned fire, and the sound of gunfire and cannons resounded for a time. The villagers near Huangpu, unaware of the inside story, moved away one after another. The Haiqi and Haichen fired cannons along the way in retaliation, causing the Second Battalion of the Salt Police on land to suffer one platoon leader and more than ten soldiers wounded. After the news reached the provincial capital, Chen Jitang telegraphed the coastal defense forces to strictly stop them and ordered the Humen Fortress Commander to open fire on the Haiqi and other ships to intercept them. That night, the Haichen and Haiqi also fired large cannons to counter the Humen Fortress, and traffic on the Humen sea was cut off for a time. On the morning of the 16th, the Guangzhou-Hong Kong ships entering the inner river from Hong Kong could not pass and returned to Hong Kong one after another. Passengers then changed to the Guangzhou-Kowloon railway to return to the province. The Haichen and Haiqi warships (the Zhaohua did not join because of machine damage) ran aground and could not proceed as they approached Humen. The Humen fortresses used new type artillery for shooting, and more than a dozen aircraft were dispatched from Guangzhou to pursue and bombard them at night, and the firepower was very fierce. The Haiqi and Haichen were forced to drop anchor in the sea near Lotus Mountain and wait for mediation. At about 9 p.m. on the 16th, Chen Vice Commander, Wu Deputy, and Wang Captain, as representatives, landed from the Yuzhu Fortress to contact the province. At the same time, the officers and soldiers of the Haiqi and Haichen warships also sent two telegrams to the Navy Department as follows: (1) "To Acting Commander Chen and Deputy Commander Zhang (Zhiying), we are preparing to sail for reasons of livelihood and to seek a new path. Heaven is above, and we have no choice but to do this. The soldiers have been under your command for two years, and you should know our hearts, and we have not touched anything about the Guangdong government. We are now fully remorseful and willing to return the fleet to you. We respectfully ask you to send representatives to the warships for contact, or representatives from the Haiqi and Haichen warships can come to the department. The entire staff and soldiers of Haiqi and Haichen bow down." (2) "(Title Omitted) The Haiqi and Haichen have dropped anchor, and the soldiers have realized their remorse. Please indicate how to contact us to ensure the safety of the sailors on the two warships and of Hao (Captain Chen Hao of the Haichen warship). We are grateful, otherwise people and boats will perish together, which would be shameful to the Chinese people. The entire staff and soldiers of Haiqi and Haichen and Chen Hao bow down." After receiving the telegram, Chen Jitang agreed to meet with the representatives of the two warships to discuss the aftermath. At the same time, Chen made a statement saying that Zhaohua's lack of blind adherence and continued berthing at Huangpu was deeply appreciated. The soldiers of the Haichen and Haiqi warships were threatened and committed treason, but now they are remorseful and not entirely unforgivable, and it is not impossible to give them a way to reform themselves. The two warships are old and have no combat power, and their retention has little to do with Guangdong's coastal defense, and their existence is only a waste of public funds. If they are truly remorseful, it may be possible to ask the Southwest Political Affairs Council to consider lenient treatment, etc. On the 17th, the two sides were still in contact, and Humen had not been relieved.

<h3 id="e115">Hankou's Commercial Decline. Losses Account for More Than 60%. Trade Associations Offer Six Relief Suggestions. <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Hubei Province has suffered frequent disasters, rural areas are declining, and urban commerce is greatly affected, and is trending towards collapse. Hankou is also destined to suffer the same fate. Now that the year 23 of the Republic is coming to an end, the settlements in various industries are showing a significant fact of commercial collapse. This is truly a serious social problem that cannot be taken lightly. According to the investigation, there are about 133 industries in Hankou, all with trade associations. There are a total of 8,109 shops that have joined trade associations, and 1,695 shops that have not joined trade associations. After analyzing and statistically analyzing the settlement situation of shops that have joined trade associations, only 685 shops have made a profit, accounting for 9% of the total, 2,396 shops can barely maintain, accounting for 29% of the total, 4,035 shops have suffered losses, accounting for 50% of the total, and 989 shops have closed down, accounting for 12% of the total. The decline can be seen. As for the reasons for the decline, there are several points: (1) rural bankruptcy and weak purchasing power, (2) inability to recover credit sales and many collapses, (3) too many businesses in the same industry do not join the trade association, competing to reduce prices, and everyone is affected, (4) too high donations, taxes and freight, (5) unable to resist foreign goods dumping. The trade association plans to offer six relief methods: (1) request the government to do its best to protect the interests of creditors, cooperation with the trade association, and find ways to recover debts from debtors, (2) ask the government to reduce taxes, donations and freight, and the trade association will save expenses on its own, (3) contact the trade association, rectify trade rules, standardize market prices, and crack down on businesses in the same industry that have not joined the trade association, (4) contact cooperatives to implement production and credit cooperation, (5) request the government to allocate funds for relief, or the commercial bank will provide credit loans with low interest, (6) advise businesses in the same industry to improve their business and improve the quality of goods. However, it is still uncertain whether it will be able to overcome this economic panic. (19th)</p>

<p>Anqing Correspondence: Since the beginning of summer, Anhui Province has experienced scarce rainfall, leading to drought conditions in various areas. People generally fear a recurrence of last year's drought. Fortunately, substantial rainfall occurred on the 14th and 15th, easing public anxiety. However, the provincial government recognizes that after successive disasters, rural areas are impoverished, and widespread displacement makes them vulnerable to famine. It previously directed the Finance Department to negotiate with the China Industrial Bank for an overdraft loan of 100,000 yuan, specifically for seed loans to the counties. This loan has now been processed, totaling 71,000 yuan. To prevent future interest charges, the government has formulated emergency drought relief measures and instructed the counties to implement them. The measures are as follows: (1) Opening dikes to divert water: Where there are no sluice gates for diversion, the dike-opening and water-diversion methods promulgated last year can be applied. When necessary, the water conservancy personnel in charge should assess the terrain and handle matters appropriately, also overseeing the dredging of ditches and canals within the dikes so that the diverted water can provide widespread irrigation. (Attached: Dike-Opening Methods) (2) Adding Equipment: Since last year, counties have been repeatedly ordered to purchase water pumps. If financial resources are insufficient, local artisans should be supervised to build dragon-bone waterwheels for use. (3) Utilizing Water Sources: Since last October, counties have been repeatedly ordered to build more waterways, ponds, and weirs, and to open up new water sources. The current need is for practical on-site investigations of water sources, guiding irrigation. (4) Aiding with Wells: Last year, counties were ordered to use well-digging as a means of drought prevention. Where water sources are insufficient, prompt supervision of the digging of ten wells is needed, with the full exploration of nearby areas rich in springs, to stimulate groundwater volume and ensure widespread irrigation. (Attached: Simplified Spring Exploration Methods) (5) Cooperative Irrigation: In applying the above methods, the following should still be noted: People often differ in their interests, lacking unity, and watch their crops wither, failing to take action. The problem lies not in the absence of water sources, but in the lack of farmer organization. Each district should be supervised to ensure that wherever there is a water source, efforts should be made to open waterways and divert irrigation, without fearing indirect routes. The manpower and tools required for water diversion and waterway opening can be collected and applied based on the benefiting acreage. If water pumps are needed, funds should be raised to purchase or rent them. Furthermore, during severe droughts, disputes over water for irrigation easily arise, so preventive maintenance should be a priority to avoid hindering cooperation. (6) Early Crop Switching: In particularly high and dry areas where irrigation is deemed difficult, prompt switching to drought-resistant crops should be ordered. (7) Diligent Weed Removal: Weeds consume the most water and compete with crops for growth, so they should be urgently removed. (8) Loosening Surface Soil: Loosening surface soil can disrupt the existing capillary structure of the soil, preventing moisture from rising, reducing evaporation, and maintaining the soil's inherent moisture. Furthermore, diligent weeding can also remove weeds, and the removed weeds can be used to cover the roots of crops to block direct sunlight. (June 17th)</p>

<p>In Ping'an, Sankan, and Liangxiang townships in the county's Fifth District, locust nymphs have recently proliferated in the area outside the dikes within the reed marshes, spreading rapidly over an area of four to five li. County Magistrate and Director of Agricultural Extension Chu Shangda have established a locust extermination office there to provide on-site guidance for elimination, and are purchasing locusts at a price of 160 cash per catty. It is said that over 300 yuan has already been spent. District Chief Xia seized the opportunity to utilize the Baojia system, recently summoning the Baojia chiefs of various townships to the office to discuss the matter. It was decided that each household would send one worker to jointly exterminate the locusts using ditch-digging and fire-burning methods. Most of the firewood is provided by the villagers, and the remainder is purchased with funds from the locust extermination office. Since the implementation of this method, it has been very effective, the locust infestation is gradually being eliminated, and the spread can be avoided.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Ministry of Finance's Taxation Department Convenes Meeting of Tobacco, Alcohol, and Stamp Tax Bureau Chiefs - Chiefs and Deputy Chiefs of Ten Provincial Tax Bureaus Attend Revenue Consolidation Meeting - Session Scheduled for Five Days <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency: In order to consolidate national tobacco, alcohol, and stamp tax revenues, the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance convened a meeting of the tobacco, alcohol, and stamp tax bureau chiefs of various provinces in Shanghai. The opening ceremony was held at 9 AM yesterday morning in the Junpu Bureau conference room on the fifth floor of the Jianghai Customs House. The session is scheduled for five days, with the closing ceremony to be held on the morning of the 24th. Minister of Finance Kong will also attend to give instructions. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Attending Bureau Chiefs</p>
<p>The opening ceremony of the meeting of the tobacco, alcohol, and stamp tax bureau chiefs of various provinces was held at 9 AM yesterday morning. The bureau chiefs from various provinces who attended included: Anhui (Chief) Jing Xuxin, Fujian (Chief) Wang Guanghui, Jiangxi (Chief) Jing Youyan, Henan (Chief) Liang Dacheng, Hubei (Deputy) Yang Duo, Shandong (Deputy) Fu Zhengshun, Zhejiang (Chief) Zhao Jinqing (Deputy) Huang Zupei, Jiangsu (Chief) Sheng Shengyi (Deputy) Xue Futian, Hunan (Chief) Tang Yan, Hebei (Chief) Ding Chungao, and others. The Taxation Department attendees included: Director Wu Qiding, Secretaries Dong Zhongding, Zhou Jiechun, Section Chiefs Fang Yunxian, Jiang Yongyi, Hong Yi, Chen Jun, Inspector Tang Shi, and others, for a total of 29 people.</p>
<p>Wu's Address</p>
<p>The meeting was presided over by Director Wu Qiding, who led the attendees in performing the usual formalities before giving his opening address. He said that the tobacco and alcohol taxes had been in place for a long time, with deep-rooted malpractices. In recent years, he had made great efforts to consolidate them, and tax revenues had increased year by year in the 21st and 22nd years, with gradual progress. He hoped to eliminate the dross and impurity, and make steady progress. However, in the 23rd year, the various bureaus reported that tax revenues as of March of this year, those that had met their quotas accounted for only one or two tenths. The rest fell short of the amount, with some only reaching thirty to forty percent. The huge shortfall was unprecedented. Tax systems are not easy to be made full, it must be a case of lax or strained implementation. The reason for this must be examined in detail and remedies sought urgently. Otherwise, the situation will become increasingly dire and irreversible. This is the fundamental purpose of convening this meeting. There are two ways to consolidate: one is to continue as before, and the other is to make a fresh start. The key is to adapt to the situation and proceed gradually in an orderly manner. The public sales fees and taxes in provinces such as Hebei and Shandong, and the fixed-amount taxes and special taxes in provinces such as Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the collection of receipts, the verification of transport documents, the tax amounts have to be compared with the amounts, and the submission of reports have fixed procedures, the legislation has never been made in secret, and the system has never been stringent, just that it has been accumulated over a long period of time, the power to tax has been abused, the tax thieves and cunning subordinates collude with each other, the statutes and regulations are regarded as insignificant, the rules and regulations are ignored, the malpractices are numerous, and cannot be investigated. Is this not a defect in the tax system, or a failure to implement it effectively? How should we reaffirm the existing regulations, strictly prohibit violations, and enforce the law without fault, establishing a fence? This is one aspect of adhering to the old regulations and strictly following them. Taxation should be based on the principles of simplicity and fairness. The current taxes on domestic tobacco and alcohol, whether inherited from old regulations or implemented under new systems, vary from place to place. This was originally a temporary measure. The types of taxes are becoming increasingly complex, and production and sales are changing frequently. What was suitable in the past may not be suitable today, and what is beneficial here may not be suitable there. A fundamental consolidation is urgently needed. However, a complete reform may not be possible in a hurry, and a sudden change may create obstacles. How should we select key issues to address and set an example? This is another aspect of planning for innovation and adopting a gradual approach. Which should be retained and which should be reformed? I hope everyone will express their views and create a plan that is neither conservative nor radical, and that is both feasible and workable. Once the standards are in place, the direction can be followed, and the future of the tobacco administration will be promising. Furthermore, laws cannot be implemented on their own. It is also important to have people to administer them. If we compare and weigh the successes and failures of the tobacco administration over the years, the changes in the system, and the amounts of revenue collected, we can deeply reflect on the reasons for the rise and fall. Gentlemen, you have experience both domestically and internationally, and have deep knowledge and expertise. After the meeting is over, bring the resolutions back with you, lead your staff, encourage each other, and put them into practice. Those who have already surpassed their quotas should not be complacent, but should strive for further progress. Those who have not met their quotas should be strictly supervised and urged to increase their revenue. By working together and overcoming the difficulties of the time, this meeting will not be in vain.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Copious Rainfall in this City Last Night and This Morning - Abrupt Drop in Temperature in this City to Only 70 Degrees - Slight Drop in Grain Market Prices and Stable Transactions <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Since the rainfall of 0.63 inches in this city on the 16th, people's hearts have been largely settled, and the anxiety in the market has also been slightly reduced. From 2:30 PM the day before yesterday until this morning, there was heavy rain again, totaling 30.5 mm. After the farmland received this irrigation, people were even more gratified. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Heavy Rain the Day Before Yesterday: From 2:30 PM the day before yesterday, the southeast wind in this city gradually tightened, followed by continuous rain. After 5 PM, the raindrops gradually increased, and after 8 PM, there was even heavier torrential rain. The wind also shifted from southeast to northeast, and the rain continued until 9 AM this morning, totaling 30.5 mm, or 1.2 inches. According to the Astronomical Observatory, if the wind direction shifts to the northwest, the sky will clear. The temperature this morning was lower than the previous day, with a minimum of 68 degrees and 70.5 degrees at 11 AM. The highest temperature the previous day was 84.2 degrees.</p>
<p>Farmland Rejuvenation: According to reports from various places, since the drought in Jiangnan and the north, more than half of the farmland has withered, cotton seedlings are difficult to sprout, rice seedlings are difficult to transplant, the soil is scorched, and the river water has dried up. Since the rainfall on the 16th, and the timely heavy rain the day before yesterday, the fields along the Jinghu, Huhangyong, and other areas, and the coastal ports in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, can all be rejuvenated. The farmers who rely on rain have been praying and making offerings for rain. This concept has been completely dispelled.</p>
<p>Transactions Trending Towards Stability: Before the rain, people in the rice and wheat markets were anxious and apprehensive. Speculators took advantage of the situation, causing considerable disruption to the market. After two heavy rains in a row this week, market transactions have stabilized. Yesterday, flour had already dropped by 0.03 to 0.05 yuan compared to the previous day, and three markets had already opened by 10:30 AM. The price of rice fell by 0.2 yuan, and the wheat market was also very stable. It is generally regarded as weak in the market, but in reality, it is stable.</p>

<p>The $3.5 million Shanghai Municipal Public Bonds issued by our municipal government on the 23rd year [of the Republic] held their first lottery redemption at the Bankers' Association yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. A total of 34 winning tickets with a face value of $5,000, 97 winning tickets with a face value of $1,000, and 130 winning tickets with a face value of $100 were drawn. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives</p>
<p>Including Cai Zengji, Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau; Lin Jinzi of the Auditing Department; Pu Ming of the Ministry of Finance; Lu Shuping of the Municipal Government; Xu Jiluan of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce; Liu Wuqiao of the Money Guild; Jin Wenyuan of the Central Bank of China; Cao Zhenming of the Bank of China; Mao Duan of the Bank of Communications; Wu Zhide of the Shanghai Municipal Bank; and over 20 staff members from the Finance Bureau.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Chairman Cai Zengji began by reporting, stating briefly: "The total amount of the Shanghai Municipal Public Bonds issued in the 23rd year of the Republic was $3.5 million, issued last July and underwritten by the [Syndicate] Bank, organized by [New] Foreign Bank. The revenue from the city's special automobile license fees is allocated to the bond fund, which is entrusted to the National Debt Fund Management Committee for safekeeping. It is stipulated that, starting from June of the 24th year of the Republic, the bonds will be redeemed by lottery over 12 years, with a lottery redemption held once every June. Today marks the first lottery redemption, with a total principal to be redeemed of $280,000. All winning bonds and matured interest coupons will be paid by the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications starting from June 30th of this year. I ask that everyone verify the winning numbers for execution of the lottery."</p>
<p>Lottery Instructions</p>
<p>1.  The public bonds are divided into three types: $5,000, $1,000, and $100. There are 427 $5,000 tickets, totaling $2.135 million; 1,207 $1,000 tickets, totaling $1.207 million; and 1,580 $100 tickets, totaling $158,000. The total amount is $3.5 million.</p>
<p>2.  This redemption is for $280,000, accounting for 8% of the total. However, because the numbers of each type of bond start from number one, ordinary methods cannot be used for the lottery.</p>
<p>3.  Based on the number of bonds issued, the average is calculated at 8%. There are 427 $5,000 bonds, so 34 tickets should win, totaling $170,000. The total amount of winning bond tickets is $280,000.</p>
<p>4.  The winning numbers are drawn sequentially from the total numbers of each bond. For example, 427 $5,000 bonds were issued, so numbers from 1 to 427, a total of 427, are placed in the lottery drum. 34 numbers are drawn sequentially, and the numbers drawn are the winning numbers for the $5,000 bonds. The winning numbers for the $1,000 and $100 bonds are drawn in the same manner.</p>
<p>Winning Numbers</p>
<p>After the Chairman's report, the numbers were inspected and the lottery began.

Chen Jitang and others have always supported the central government. As for the movements of the warships Haiqi and Haishen, I have only seen reports in the newspapers. The Nanjing office has not received any telegrams." Yang plans to stay in Shanghai for a few days before going to Nanjing.</p>

<h3 id="e134">The New Jiangtian Steamer; Cabin Steward Dispute Resolved; The Ship Is Expected to Resume Sailing Tomorrow <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Shanghai-Ningbo passenger ship New Jiangtian announced the suspension of its service to the reorganization of cabin staff, the removal of the "cold water gang". The cabin staff have now indicated compliance and registered as ordered, so the company plans to resume sailing tomorrow. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Abolition of the "Cold Water Gang"</p>
<p>In addition to the regular cabin stewards on the New Jiangtian, there was also the so-called "cold water gang" of assistant cabin stewards, whose numbers were twice that of the regular cabin stewards. As a result, passengers boarding the ship would see nothing but cabin stewards, while the regular cabin stewards could do nothing and pocket huge profits. The company's first point in reforming the cabin staff system was to limit the number of cabin stewards and clerks and order the informal "cold water gang" cabin stewards to leave the ship immediately and not be allowed to board the New Jiangtian again. This has now been done.</p>
<p>Cabin Stewards Agreed to Register</p>
<p>The suspension of the ship was caused by the cabin stewards' resistance to registration. Since the suspension on Monday, the cabin stewards on board have also realized that opposition will not solve the problem. Therefore, since yesterday, the regular cabin stewards have gradually complied and no longer resolutely resist. When the company sent staff to the ship to order everyone to register, the cabin stewards expressed acceptance and automatically filled out and submitted the registration forms issued by the company, attaching their photos for verification.</p>
<p>Agreed Number of Cabin Stewards</p>
<p>According to regulations, the number of cabin stewards on the New Jiangtian should only be over 170, but there are currently over 280 people. In order to temporarily maintain everyone's livelihood, the company still registers and hires over 280 people, but does not allow the hiring of assistants. This point has also been agreed upon. However, it is rumored that if so many cabin stewards are not needed on the ship, the company may select a portion of them to stay in Shanghai for training, in preparation for assigning them to other ships in the future. This matter is still under negotiation.</p>
<p>Eliminate Bad Habits</p>
<p>The cabin stewards on the ship do not have salaries and rely entirely on passengers' tips and alcohol commissions for the majority of their income. However, the company has not collected deposits or guarantee money from these cabin stewards. Therefore, the company is now discussing new regulations to eliminate the bad habit of demanding alcohol commissions from passengers. The cabin stewards will be paid wages by the company, provisionally set at $16 per month per person, plus a food allowance of $5. Since the cabin stewards have wages and food, they are not allowed to demand a single cent from passengers. The company will issue a notice and print it on the ship tickets, advising passengers not to give tips privately, to avoid undermining the new system. The company will spend over $5,000 per month in this way.</p>
<p>Resuming Service on Saturday</p>
<p>Since all issues have been resolved, the new system can be easily implemented. Yesterday, General Manager Liu Hongsheng discussed with the heads of various departments and decided that the suspension of the New Jiangtian was due to the elimination of the "cold water gang" and the reformation of the cabin stewards. Now that the cabin stewards have expressed obedience, there is no need to continue the suspension. It was decided to resume normal service starting on Saturday (the 21st), and the incident can be considered over.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Representatives of Overseas Chinese Aiding in Siam; Returned to Shanghai Yesterday from Nanjing; Refuting the Talks of the Siamese Delegation <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The United Association of Shanghai groups assisting overseas Chinese in Siam, previously sent five representatives - Huang Jianzhong of the Overseas Chinese United Association, Chen Luqin of the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association, Zheng Jikai of the Guangdong Fellow Villagers Association, Zhang Nanyin of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Guo Qiming of the Chaozhou Fellow Villagers Association - to Nanjing on the 15th to request the central government to sign a commercial treaty with Siam as soon as possible, and to negotiate the issue of Siam's unreasonable oppression of our overseas Chinese. The results were quite satisfactory. The petition delegation has now completed its mission. Except for Zheng Jikai, Zhang Nanyin, and Guo Qiming, who returned to Shanghai on the 19th, Chen Luqin and Huang Jianzhong also returned to Shanghai yesterday one after another. It is learned that the association is scheduled to convene an executive committee meeting tomorrow (the 22nd) to report the results of the petition in Nanjing and to discuss sending personnel to Fujian, Guangdong, Hong Kong and other places to negotiate the implementation of the embargo on Siamese rice. A reporter from Shen Shi News Agency asked Chen Luqin, secretary of the Overseas Chinese United Association, at the association's office on [Avenue] Dubail yesterday about the Siamese Far East delegation's denial of the Siamese government's anti-Chinese activities. Chen replied as follows:</p>
<p>Satisfactory Results of the Petition in Nanjing</p>
<p>Chen first reported on the details of the petition in Nanjing, stating briefly: "The five representatives of the petition delegation took the 11:00 PM express train to Nanjing on the 15th, and arrived in the capital at 7:00 AM the next morning. They immediately met with the welcoming representatives from Nanjing to discuss the petition and the joint delivery of a memorandum to the Siamese delegation. Later, due to fatigue from the journey, they opened room 363 at the Central Hotel to rest briefly and planned the steps to be taken for the petition on the 17th. On the morning of the 17th, they submitted petitions to the Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. Secretary-General Ye Chuqing of the Central Party Headquarters received them and expressed his appreciation for the delegation's enthusiasm in assisting overseas Chinese, and promised to forward the petition to the central government immediately, ordering Ambassador Jiang in Japan to continue negotiations with Siam. They also joined the Joint Association of Nanjing Municipal Agricultural, Industrial, Commercial, Academic, and Women's Groups to deliver a memorandum to the Siamese delegation at the Overseas Chinese Reception Center, asking them to convey to the Siamese government the Chinese people's hope that the Siamese government would abolish various harsh regulations that abuse overseas Chinese and improve the treatment of overseas Chinese. In the afternoon, they hosted the Nanjing news media at the Central Hotel, with dozens of reporters from various newspapers attending. Huang Jianzhong reported on the purpose and mission of the petition and the situation of Siamese oppression of overseas Chinese. Representatives of various newspapers also spoke one after another, expressing their willingness to fulfill their journalistic duty. The atmosphere at the venue was quite tense. In the evening, Xiao Jishan, a standing committee member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, also hosted a banquet to welcome the representatives. The representatives called, ran around, and suffered much in Nanjing for several days, but fortunately the results were quite satisfactory and somewhat comforting."</p>
<p>Denying Anti-Chinese Activities is Evading Responsibility and Covering Up</p>
<p>Chen then replied to the reporter's question about the Siamese delegation's denial of anti-Chinese activities. Chen expressed regret that most of the points mentioned by the delegation ignored the existing facts. "We have received reports from overseas Chinese groups in Siam, which can be used as evidence. The reports state briefly that Tuayue, a resident of Thonburi and Bukhalo districts near Bangkok, is the leader of the Siamese Tram Workers' Union. He had previously been ordered by the leader of the Siamese People's Party to incite Chinese rice mill workers to demand wage increases, which led to a major strike. Tuayue took advantage of the labor-management disputes of the overseas Chinese to nationalize the Chinese factories, allowing Siamese workers to enjoy the benefits. Now, on May 23, on the grounds of facilitating business and providing relief to Siamese workers, he submitted a petition to the Siamese Labor Bureau, requesting the Labor Bureau to establish rice mills and lumber mills. After receiving the petition, the Labor Bureau considered the matters presented to be outside the scope of the Labor Bureau and forwarded the petition to the government for review, which is expected to be approved. As mentioned above, Siam's anti-Chinese actions continue to arise. The various points mentioned by the delegation are excuses and cover-ups, which cannot be denied."</p>
<p>Changing the Compulsory Courses is Just Perfunctory</p>
<p>Regarding the suppression of overseas Chinese education, Chen said, "The Siamese Ministry of Education previously proposed a compromise of compulsory classes because our people rose up in opposition, and the various harsh regulations imposed on overseas Chinese aroused public indignation, and even advocated boycotting Siamese rice as a punishment. In order to ease the people's anger, they had proposed to allow Chinese schools to re-register, and petition the Siamese government to establish compulsory classes within the schools. However, news came from Siam that none of the Chinese schools that went to the Ministry of Education to register were approved, because the Siamese government is still taking a wait-and-see attitude towards our people. As for the Siamese Far East delegation's statement that Siam has not forced foreign-run schools to teach Siamese, only required a few hours of Siamese language per week, it is clear that they are trying to cover up and deceive the Chinese people. Last year, the Siamese Ministry of Education issued a notice to all Chinese schools to establish compulsory classes, and the curriculum required 23 hours of Siamese language per week. The regulations of the Ministry of Education have been translated and published in newspapers, and the Chinese people have long known about them. The regulations also force overseas Chinese children between the ages of seven and fourteen to receive compulsory education in Siamese schools. The facts are clear, and there is no point in covering them up."</p>
<p>Sending Personnel to Hong Kong and Guangdong to Boycott Siamese Rice</p>
<p>Chen finally said, "The five representatives plan to convene on the 21st for a consultation, and tomorrow they will hold a standing committee meeting to implement the dispatch of personnel to Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Xiamen and other places to coordinate the implementation of the boycott of Siamese rice imports, in order to promote the awakening of the Siamese government. Before the two countries sign a treaty, we must first achieve the following three expectations: (1) In politics, abolish the military service of overseas Chinese in Siam. (2) In economics, abolish various harsh taxes and levies. (3) In education, abolish the order to force Chinese soldiers to read selected texts for 23 hours. Whether Chinese children should read Siamese language should be ordered by our Ministry of Education itself, and Chinese school teachers should not be forced to take Siamese language exams by the Siamese government. If the above three items can be achieved, then the feelings of the people of the two countries can naturally become more friendly, and the mutual signing of a commercial treaty between the two countries can also reach its goal sooner."</p>

<p>The Siamese Far East Delegation, a group of seventeen people, arrived in Shanghai on the 18th from Nanjing. The mayor Wu met with them the day before yesterday, and the mayor has scheduled to host a banquet at the Municipal Government in the city center at 12:00 noon today, inviting more than 30 leaders from the financial and industrial sectors to accompany them.

Chairman Yu Qiaqing was absent due to business and asked Secretary-General Yang Youlong to receive them on his behalf. The representatives first stated that in this period of social recession, the sailors hold the spirit of labor-management cooperation and do not make demands, hoping to understand the lives of the workers. The proposal to pay 80% of the salary should not be implemented. As for the request to the government to issue a shipping public bond of 10 million yuan, the sailors are determined to make every effort to request the central government to approve the issuance. Secretary-General Yang promised to submit the written request to the general assembly for a public decision. The representatives left around 11:00 AM.</p>

<p>According to the Shanghai Times, the Shanghai Municipal Council has recently moved the Central Police Station to a new building on Fuzhou Road. Due to the poor market conditions and financial emergency in Shanghai, the original plan to rebuild the old building has been postponed indefinitely. However, it will not be left vacant for long. The Municipal Council has considered temporarily repairing it to house some police officers. When the market turns around, a new building will be rebuilt. Several suggestions have been submitted to the Municipal Council, but none have been definitively decided. One proposal was to build a municipal hall on the site of the old Central Police Station and the current Central Fire Department, with the Municipal Council's library attached. This proposal was well-received by the Municipal Council, but the cost is huge, and the Municipal Council's current financial resources cannot afford it. According to a member of the Municipal Council yesterday, there is hope of implementing it when financial resources are slightly more available in the future. The most urgent matter now is to move the Central Fire Department to a more suitable location. The Municipal Council has acknowledged that the current building is not only unsuitable for use, but also very dangerous, as the huge fire engines frequently enter and exit, and the vibrations have made the building shake greatly. The new extension of the [Wayside Jail] West Jail on Ward Road is about to be completed, and the foreign prisoners held in the West Jail on Xiamen Road will all be moved in. Therefore, the building on Xiamen Road will be demolished and a new building will be built to house the Central Fire Department. However, the new building will require several months to complete.</p>

<p>Due to financial difficulties, the Ningbo Industrial Bank announced a suspension of payments. Subsequently, its founder, Wu Zhihao, went into hiding, and there has been no news of resumption of business or liquidation. Creditors, led by Zhang Zilian, formed a creditors' association and began registration. Yesterday, they convened a meeting of creditors in the assembly hall of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, electing fifteen representatives to appeal to various parties, demanding the bank's repayment. The details of the meeting are recorded below:</p>
<p>Attendance of Creditors: The creditors' meeting of Ningbo Industrial Bank was held yesterday afternoon from 2:00 PM in the assembly hall of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Over 270 creditors attended, mostly small merchants and artisans from Ningbo, with a considerable number of fashionable young men and women. The atmosphere at the meeting was very tense, with a strong hope for repayment. When the chairman reported, "Demanding the bank's responsible parties to repay debts in full," the whole venue erupted in thunderous applause and cheers. Subsequently, it was decided to elect fifteen representatives to be responsible for negotiations. After the representatives were elected, the attendees firmly requested the representatives to take an oath, followed by a three-bow salute, to show the public's expectations and the importance of their entrustment.</p>
<p>Meeting Details: The presidium of the meeting consisted of Zhang Zilian, Chen Zhonggao, Hong Yanbin, Qiu Liangyu, Jiang Beiping, and others. Following formalities, Chairman Zhang Zilian and others reported that since the sudden closure of the Ningshi Bank, there has been no news of resumption of business or liquidation. To protect the legal rights of creditors and facilitate negotiations, the creditors' association was formed, and registration was initiated. Within a week, 2,358 households registered, totaling 513,467.98 yuan. The majority of creditors are small business owners, whose hard-earned money has been lost, a truly pitiful situation. Today's meeting was convened with enthusiastic participation, and we will discuss appropriate measures for further action, demanding full repayment. It was also found that the bank's liabilities amount to over 700,000 yuan. Although the person in charge has gone into hiding, we should appeal to society and ensure the achievement of our goal.</p>
<p>Election of Representatives: After discussion, the following fifteen representatives were elected to be responsible for negotiations: Zhang Zilian, Chen Zhonggao, Wang Beiping, Qiu Xubai, Wang Xiangqing, Hong Yanbin, Qiu Liangyu, Wu Peng, Zhou Kechuan, Zhu Shujian, Tong Xinqin, Wang Hongzhai, Chen Yuantong, Zhao Kuiyi, Xiao Chuhua. Zhang Zilian reported on the next steps, first visiting Yu Qiaqing and others, requesting their assistance, and then finding a way to find Wu Zhihao to discuss everything face-to-face. He hoped that everyone would await the results quietly during the process and not cause any twists and turns due to resentment. The representatives will act in good conscience and work hard to stabilize society. If there is any malfeasance, they will be "traitors." The meeting ended with laughter and cheers from the entire venue.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the liquidation officer of Mei Feng Bank, He Fu, will announce this Saturday the total amount of loans and overdrafts owed to the bank by various customers, excluding those owed by the Leiwen companies. He will also announce the total amount of overdue debts recovered in recent days. He Fu told a Shanghai Times reporter yesterday that he had notified all debtors before the 11th, requesting prompt repayment, but few responded, which was disappointing. Therefore, it may be necessary to resort to the courts to recover all debts as soon as possible. The announcement to be made on Saturday is not intended to alarm the public, but there are many who care about the liquidation matters, so he feels he should report the news from time to time. He also said that many have recently inquired about the status of the Zhouwen companies. The depositors' concerns are understandable, but he cannot answer them all at present. After the accounts of the banks, etc., are checked, he will consider answering them accordingly.</p>

<p>Eulogy</p>
<p>On this day, the 20th day of the sixth month of the 24th year of the Republic of China, Ding Mao, the Firefighting United Association of the Hu Nan District of Shanghai, with pure wine and simple dishes, offers sacrifices to the spirits of the pioneers of this association, saying: Preventing disasters and defending against calamities, we people take public welfare as our hearts; respecting virtue and rewarding merit, since ancient times, we have valued the ceremony of clarity. All those who have benefited society will not let their spirits be forgotten. Looking back since the establishment of our association, the years have changed repeatedly. How many generations of former sages have passed away, but their achievements remain. Some took righteousness with great courage, serving with their lives; others accumulated years of hard work, serving the public despite illness. Some started businesses with difficulty, planning and calculating; others provided regular subsidies, enthusiastically contributing. Alive, they benefited people, and their merits were fully realized. Dead, they can be sacrificed to the community. Feeling grateful together, at this time when the new summer wine is widely poured, and we are just at the time of the Dragon Boat Festival. Looking far away, Penglai Island can be reached, or we may encounter the day when the crane of transformation returns. Wearing copper crowns and leather shoes, in the past, we followed each other in labor. Riding the wind horse and driving the cloud carriage, today their voices and appearances are as if they were still here. With the sincerity of offering posthumous sacrifices, may the fragrant offerings reach far away. We especially open this memorial meeting, forever vowing never to forget. We present clean offerings of algae with piety, offering simple sacrifices, hoping that the spirits will come and protect us in times of rain and darkness, to reassure the gods.</p>

<p>Li Guanlin, a local resident of an unmarked bungalow on Route雷上达 in the French Concession, is over fifty years old. His only son, nicknamed Jinsheng, is only four years old. At around 7:00 PM on the 13th of last month, four bandits suddenly came, kidnapped Jinsheng, and took him away. Before leaving, they fired a shot from a handgun, fortunately without injuring anyone. However, a month has passed since and there has been no news. Yesterday afternoon, the French police safely rescued the hostage Li Jinsheng in the area of 交新沙 in Pudong, and arrested the kidnappers and suspects. The details are investigated separately below:</p>
<p>Negotiation of Location</p>
<p>After the bandits kidnapped Jinsheng, they repeatedly sent letters demanding a large ransom, without specifying an address. The day before yesterday (the 19th), Guanlin was replied to, stating that tomorrow (the 20th) at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, someone must wear a blue cloth long shirt, holding a sugar cane, and wait at the New Gate Bridge. At that time, someone will come to negotiate.</p>
<p>Three Captured</p>
<p>After receiving the letter, Li Guanlin reported to the Lujiawan Police Station. The police chief ordered Inspector Jin Jiulin, detective Zhang Ziying, Zhou Buguang, Deputy Detective Qin Youyu, and detective Dai Rongji to disguise themselves and rush to the area. Before long, three people came forward to negotiate. The detectives immediately stepped forward and captured them all in one fell swoop. According to them, the three are named Dong Aqing, Chen Qingsheng, and Zhao Taotao, local residents. The hostage is hidden in the area of 交新沙 in Pudong.</p>
<p>Hostage Rescued</p>
<p>After the French police received the confession, they urgently ordered the original team of detectives to escort Dong Aqing and others across the river to Pudong. They first went to the 3rd District Sub-bureau in Pudong for assistance. Sub-bureau chief Zhang ordered several detectives to assist in the destination. The hostage was then rescued, and the bandits Su Shaogen and Yang Hongde, who were guarding the hostage, were arrested on the spot. Afterwards, over 20 suspects were arrested in Fuxing Inn on Beller Road, Yangshupu, and Ziyang Road, and detained in the French police station. They will be sent to court for interrogation this morning.</p>

<p>According to the China News Agency, the domestic pigment industry in this city has recently adopted a tight fiscal policy and reduced external loans. Therefore, the association held a meeting to discuss it. Everyone agreed that the strength of the industry is limited, and it is difficult to trade on credit. The credit period for selling loans has been revised. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Full Agreement</p>
<p>A few days ago, the members of the Municipal Domestic Pigment Industry Association, including Xie Ji Xin, Tong Ren He, Jin Tai Chang, De Tai Cheng, Tong Xie Xiang, Tong Tai Xiang, Jiu He Xiang, Tai He Xiang, Yi Yu Chang, Cheng Mao, Yong Mao Xiang, Fuxing Heng, Tong Yuan Sheng, Tong Chang Xiang, Hui Chang, Run Chang Xiang, Tong He Xiang, Xie Mao Xiang, and other 20 companies, recently decided to revise the credit period for selling goods due to the reduction of loans in the financial sector and limited strength.</p>
<p>Reduced to Ten Days</p>
<p>All members agreed that the credit period for selling goods to customers in various places was originally divided into two types: cash and one-month term. Except for cash transactions that do not need to be changed, all one-month term notes will be changed to ten-day term notes from today, both locally and abroad. Overdue will be rejected, and all members have been notified to inform all customers at home and abroad.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Various Textile Mills Advocate the Use of Domestic Cotton; Foreign Cotton Sales Decline Daily; It Is Predicted That This Year's Sales Will Be at Most One Million Bales; Shaanxi Cotton Is Difficult to Sell Due to Merchants' Speculation <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, textile mills in this city have actively used domestic cotton, and imports of foreign cotton have decreased daily. According to news from the cotton industry yesterday, since the establishment of the Cotton Industry Improvement Society of the National Economic Commission, the output of cotton in our country has increased year by year, and the quality has become increasingly better. Therefore, various textile mills are happy to adopt it in large quantities, and sales are increasing by leaps and bounds. It is found that during the period of 1920-21, foreign cotton sales were very strong, with an annual volume of 4.5 to 6 million bales. From 1922-23, the sales volume was only 3 million bales, and last year, the sales volume was only 1.8 million bales. This year's sales volume, according to observations in the cotton industry, will not exceed 1 million bales at most. The most imported cotton is from the United States, followed by India, and then Egypt. It is heard that the sales volume of domestic cotton is more brisk this month than last month. The rumor that Shaanxi cotton is difficult to sell is due to the speculation of a few merchants and is not the whole situation.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Commodity Inspection Bureau Schedules Regular Livestock Inspection; Revises Inspection Fees and Formulates Inspection Certificates; All Implemented from July 1st <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau previously received instructions from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to prepare for livestock inspection, and preparations have now been completed. It is scheduled to implement it on July 1st. In addition, various inspection items, such as raw silk, tung oil, fruits and vegetables, sesame, etc., have been re-edited and new chapters have been made, and inspection fees have been collected. Various inspection certificates have also been re-formulated by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and ordered to all local commodity inspection bureaus to implement them uniformly from July 1st.</p>
<h3 id="e152">The Tung Yi Bank's Resumption of Business Is Uncertain; Zhang Danru Is Accused; Xu Xiaozuo Comes Forward to Mediate; The Hearing Is Postponed to the 28th <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The Tung Yi Bank, founded by Zhang Danru, a wealthy merchant from Nanxun living in Shanghai, closed on February 21st this year due to financial difficulties. At that time, all creditors were told that business was temporarily suspended for liquidation, so the general depositors were waiting for it. Unexpectedly, President Zhang Danru disappeared from then on, and it has been more than four months since then, putting debts behind him. The creditors of the bank realized that Zhang's statement of liquidation and resumption of business was actually a deception. Therefore, they actively planned to protect their creditor interests. First, Zhang Youxun and Pan Weiquan jointly hired lawyer Qian Tingan to criminally accuse Zhang Danru of embezzlement in the First Special District Local Court, requesting punishment in accordance with Article 356 of the Criminal Law, and to recover the principal and interest of the deposit with civil litigation. The indictment stated: The defendant's empty words about future business resumption are nothing more than delaying and absconding. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang held a court hearing. According to the written report of the bailiff, he followed the instructions to send the summons to the defendant's residence at No. 76 Jingan Villa on Jingan Temple Road, but the defendant himself was not seen. No one accepted the summons and a copy of the plaintiff's complaint. Subsequently, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that since the lawsuit was filed, accountant Xu Yongzuo, entrusted by Zhang Danru, came forward to mediate and requested that the case be adjourned. If reconciliation fails, the plaintiff knows the defendant's residence well and will naturally direct the summons to the case. The court then ordered the hearing to be postponed to the morning of the 28th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Fire in Jia Le Road; Four Deaths Burned to Death; Shi Wenbao and Two Sons Died While Visiting Relatives; Corpses with Broken Limbs and Legs, Gruesome to Look At <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The report that the house at No. 198, Lane 2, Yongxing Alley, Jia Le Road, French Concession, was rented to a second landlord as a workshop for manufacturing imitation jade and rosin combs, and a fire broke out the night before due to worker negligence, causing the owner and workers to escape on the spot and burning people to death, was briefly recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the second landlord of the house is Shi Zengqing from Jiaxing, 44 years old this year, who has been a waiter at the Huizhong Hotel for many years. In addition to living on the floor above, he recently rented the common room downstairs to an unknown jade rosin craft workshop. Recently, Shi Wenbao (32 years old from Jiaxing, wife of Shi Shaoshan, Shi's uncle), who had been inquired from his hometown, came to Shanghai three or four days ago with his eldest son Shi Qiaoguan, 9 years old, and his youngest son Hui Bao, 3 years old, to visit Shi Zengqing and his wife, temporarily residing in the back loft of the common room. When the fire broke out the night before, Shi and his wife were already asleep upstairs. Shi Wenfei, his two sons, and Zengqing's cousin Shi Qingbao, a total of four people, were also asleep. When the fire broke out, the owner and workers of the workshop who caused the fire all fled to avoid punishment. Shi Qingzeng and his wife jumped out of the upstairs window. Shi Qingbao and Shi Wenbao woke up from their dreams. Wenbao immediately took his two sons downstairs to avoid the fire and entered the kitchen shed. Because the house had no back door, and the fire blocked the door and burned, Shi Qingbao, Shi Wenbao, Shi Qiaoguan, and Shi Huibao, a total of four people, could not escape and died together in the fire. Afterwards, the Fire Brigade pulled out the corpses of Shi Qingbao, Shi Wenbao, and Shi Huibao. They had broken limbs and legs, ruptured abdomens and flowing intestines, and looked like charred wood, which was gruesome to look at. The police sent detectives to carry the corpses to the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-hall autopsy station, and brought the second landlord Shi Qingzeng to the case for questioning. Yesterday, the Criminal Court's Procuratorate was requested to dispatch ten prosecutors, including forensic doctor Wei and clerk Peng, to the station for inspection. The family member Shi Shaoshan arrived at the scene to identify the corpses. After the autopsy, he sat on the public case. According to the investigation report of detective Zhang Chunsheng, the officials interrogated Shi Qingzeng and Shi Shaoshan. They then ordered that the corpses of Shi Qingbin, Shi Wenbin, and Shi Huibao were indeed burned to death during their lifetimes, and the corpses were handed over to Shi Qingzeng and others to collect the corpses separately. The arsonist or arsonists will be arrested by the police department for investigation and interrogation. As for Shi Qingzeng's wife, who was slightly injured when she jumped down, she went to the hospital for treatment. The police are now sending detectives to investigate the fire starter and bring them to justice for interrogation. The corpse of Shi Qiaoguan was pulled out by the Fire Brigade at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon and taken to the autopsy station, waiting for today's autopsy report.</p>
<h3 id="e154">After Xu Yabo's Death, Concubine Sues for Property Division; First Wife's Side Claims Ignorance; Plaintiff Presents Identity Proof <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Xu Yabo, from Hubei, was the former district chief of the First Jiangsu Water Police District stationed in Minhang. After his resignation, he lived in Shanghai as a retired official. Several years ago, he was implicated in the robbery case of the notorious bandit Tai Bao Ashu, who had already been captured. After repeated appeals, he was finally declared innocent and returned to Shanghai to reside at No. 254 Juji Da Road in the French Concession. Due to his inner turmoil, he fell ill and passed away in April of this year despite medical treatment. Recently, Xu Lu Qiuyun, Xu Yabo's concubine residing at No. 497 Xin Dagu Road, along with her three sons, jointly filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court through a lawyer against Xu Wangshi, Xu's legal wife, seeking a division of property. The lawsuit stated that the legal representative, Xu Lu Qiuyun, at the age of fifteen, was seduced and defiled by Xu Yabo, who then took her as his concubine and housed her separately. The plaintiffs in this case, Xu Boli, Xu BoWei, and Xu Bosheng, were born from this union. All their living expenses were borne by Xu Yabo. Unfortunately, Xu Yabo passed away in April of this year. The defendant, Xu Wangshi, as Xu Yabo's legal wife, has completely seized all the inheritance, causing the plaintiff and her sons to live in great hardship. As co-heirs of Xu Yabo, they are suffering from unequal distribution of wealth. It is discovered that Xu Yabo owned properties during his lifetime, such as the "Ya Residence" in Minhang, land and houses in Zhuji, and cash, totaling 70,000 yuan. Xu Yabo's first wife had a daughter, and the defendant also had two sons. Together with the plaintiff's brothers and sister, there are seven heirs in total. The inheritance should be divided into seven shares, each share being 10,000 yuan. The plaintiff should receive 30,000 yuan. They request the court to order the surrender and distribution of the inheritance, etc. The court approved the case. Yesterday morning at 10:30, Judge Ma Yishu summoned both the plaintiff and the defendant in Civil Court No. 7. Both parties were represented by lawyers. First, the plaintiff's lawyer presented the case and stated a request to change the object of the lawsuit, dividing the 70,000 yuan inheritance into eight shares, including the defendant Xu Wangshi as one share. The three plaintiffs should jointly receive more than 16,000 yuan of the inheritance, etc. The defendant's lawyer, Xu Yannian, responded that the defendant was completely unaware that Xu Yabo had another concubine and children during his lifetime. Even if it were true, Xu Yabo's financial situation was dire after his discharge, burdened with debts. He was falsely accused of conspiring in a robbery case during his lifetime. When he was acquitted and released from prison, he borrowed money and rice from others, and there are letters that can prove this. As for the Ya Residence, it is only worth three or four thousand yuan, but it has already been mortgaged to the wife of Shen Baoyi. There is no other inheritance. He requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed, etc. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer presented photos of Xu Yabo with the plaintiff and school certificates, with Xu Yabo listed as the parent, which can prove the identity of the plaintiffs. The court verified the evidence and instructed both lawyers to debate the case before announcing the conclusion and scheduling the verdict for the afternoon of the 20th.</p>

<p>Li Zhangyu, a local, used to be a chauffeur. Since losing his job, he specialized in stealing car parts. His methods were clever and always successful. He made a living this way in both the British and French Concessions, with more than eleven households being victims of his thefts. The stolen car parts included car bells, horns, air pumps, angle irons, and other items. As the saying goes, "A thousand days of thieving, there will surely be a day of exposure." On the 12th of this month, he was caught near the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Route Dufour by Chinese Detective Shen Dehui of the Municipal Police and sent to the First Special District Court for investigation. During the investigation, it was discovered that between October 3rd of last year and June 11th of this year, he had stolen parts from cars belonging to: (1) a Westerner at No. 987 Tibet Road; (2) a Westerner at No. 1677 Avenue Haig; (3) a Westerner at the western end of Xin Zha Road near Hardoon Road; (4) a Westerner near the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Route Dufour; (5) a Westerner at No. 1187 Connaught Road; (6) Tang Shixuan, a Chinese resident of the French Concession outside Xiaoshadu Road No. 336; (7) Shi Yucun, a Chinese resident of No. 1087 Dagu Road; (8) Yao Jiakun, a Chinese resident of No. 1564 Xin Zha Road; (9) Xin Yaoyang, a Chinese resident of No. 3 Route Dufour; (10) a Westerner near the small vegetable market on Boone Road; (11) a Westerner near the Racecourse on Route Say Zo. The stolen parts were worth more than 400 yuan, which he spent. Yesterday, Judge Liu Yugui presided over the Eighth Criminal Court and clearly questioned him. Li Zhangyu was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment. The number of days of detention before the judgment was finalized will be deducted from the prison term at a rate of one day for one day. He was also allowed to be taken by the Special Second District Court police. After the interrogation, he was sent back to serve his sentence.</p>

They have also written a paper titled "Home Education in China" in English, describing China as a country that values family education, with countless virtuous mothers and righteous women throughout history, as well as the progress of new China in the field of home education, so that Representative Ding can read it at the conference and have it published in newspapers in various countries, so that people from various countries can understand the state of home education in China. In addition to the above English publicity brochure and English paper, the Chinese Association for the Protection of Children has also drafted the following five proposals for the conference: (1) In the future, the highest goal of home education in all countries of the world should be to "train children to be world citizens" (including understanding and respect for other races and other countries, as well as the virtues of striving for lofty ideals for mankind), in order to sweep away the darkness of the past world and establish the light of the original world. (2) The International Federation for Home Education should publish a periodical to promote home education in all countries of the world, and to enable parents in various countries to recognize each other, exchange opinions, understand each other's special problems, and the special methods to deal with these special problems. (3) The International Federation for Home Education should establish branches in various countries of the world to assist the General Assembly in completing its great achievements. (4) In the history of various countries in the world, we often find the handsome and wise faces of great parents. For example, in the history of the Hebrew nation, there are the mothers of Moses, Samuel, and Jesus. In the history of the Chinese nation, there are the mothers of Ji Chang (King Wen of Zhou), Mencius, and Yue Fei. All these people were able to cultivate virtuous children with their painstaking efforts and make significant contributions to mankind. The International Federation for Home Education should appoint a number of committees to collect the stories of great parents of this kind from various countries and compile them into "Biographies of Great Parents of the World" to distribute to various countries for parents to admire and emulate. (5) The International Federation for Home Education should at any time praise the achievements and express gratitude for the efforts of great fathers (who can train their children to become world citizens with painstaking efforts and make significant and special contributions to the world and mankind) in the modern world. All the above items have been compiled by Xu Jianping, the general secretary of the association, and sent to Geneva, Switzerland, yesterday, and handed over to Representative Ding Shujing for use at the meeting on July 31st.</p>

He is kind and amiable to passengers, and his colleagues get along well with him. Therefore, he is highly valued by the Westerners in the company, and his colleagues have always praised him.

<p>Baoxing Lane in Zhabei's Baoxing Road is surrounded by desolation, and the rent is expensive. The full details of the tenants' requests for rent reduction have been recorded in this newspaper. At 1:30 PM yesterday, another hearing was held. Forty-five tenants attended, represented by lawyers Yu Hualong and Chen Yi and agents Hu Yukang and Sheng Ruji. They immediately stated that the rents in the vicinity are lower. The cost and land price of Baoxing Lane are calculated to have a strong interest rate of 1.8%, which is difficult to bear due to such heavy exploitation. The market is declining and people's livelihoods are declining. They requested that the court order a 30% rent reduction. The judge asked the representative of the defendant, the Tongfu Company, lawyer Huang, how much the land price was and how many rooms could be built per mu. Huang replied that the Zhabei market is becoming more prosperous every day. As soon as a room is built, it will immediately open for business. The land price of Baoxing Lane is 30,000 yuan per mu, and 11 shikumen rooms can be built per mu. However, the tenants were enraged when they heard Huang's exaggerated words. Because they had to maintain order in court, they could not question him. After the court adjourned and went to the lawyers' lounge, the tenants asked lawyer Huang why he had exaggerated the Zhabei market to such an extent. The judge also asked because the defendant's lawyer Huang's answers were excessive. A reinvestigation will be carried out after a personal investigation.</p>

<p>Zhang Asong, a 46-year-old Suzhou native, has been running Zhang Ji Board/Brush Wholesale Shop at No. 372 Fangbin Road in the city for over ten years. Zhang's wife, Ms. Yu, and their children live upstairs, while fourteen employees and apprentices live downstairs.

<p>A scholar dies for one who understands him. The ancients said that one should not regret dying if one has a true friend. In the vast sea of dust, who can truly be called a true friend? Daily, I am with my shadow, and my shadow is with me.</p>
<p>"Once power is in hand, one should issue orders." Life is like morning dew. Do not miss the good opportunity in this one morning, this one moment when you are in command. It will be too late to regret it after death. Therefore, life is about "doing what is timely." (Fictitious Chen quote.)</p>
<p>Playing mahjong, "Pure One Suit" can be counted as three points. However, to get a "Pure One Suit" depends on luck and skill. Unless one cheats, it cannot be forced. Therefore, the "Pure One Suit" in mahjong can be called "Heavenly." In a corner of society, wherever people gather, if they use "artificial" means to create a "Pure One Suit," they must use mechanical means, and they also need to use handless squeezing and crowding to remove all the mixed colors, attracting "brothers-in-law," "cousins," "relatives," "fellow villagers," "neighbors," and so on. As long as they are from the same nest, they are all stuffed in, so that they can control everything with ease and teamwork. This is a "Pure One Suit" created by "artificial" means. This victory is even more impressive than the three points in mahjong, and it cannot be calculated in detail.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Cat's Eyes <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Yimin</p>
<p>When I was young, I read Qing Yu Quyuan's "Cat's Eyes" essay and learned that the cat's eyes change over time, with different shapes in the morning, evening, sunny, and rainy weather. If used to tell time, it is not accurate. Later, I verified this with the cats I kept at home, and it was true.</p>
<p>I am now excerpting some of the words from the essay to tell those who believe that cat's eyes can tell time:</p>
<p>"The anonymous 'Adjusting Types' of this dynasty has a 'Cat's Eyes Time-Telling Song' that says: 'A line at midnight and noon, round at mao and you, like ginkgo leaves at yin, shen, si, and hai, and like coins on their side at chen, xu, chou, and wei.'" I recorded this in the 'Tea Fragrance Studio Readings.'"</p>
<p>"Wang Mengwei said: 'The cat's eyes are bright at night but dim in the daytime. At noon, when the sunlight is strong, the cat's eyes are afraid of the sun and often close their eyes to sleep. Or if they open them, they are forced by the sunlight, and their eyes contract into a line. In the chen and si hours, the sun's power is not strong, and in the shen and you hours, the heat has already receded, so they all shrink like date pits. However, at night, they are round in all six hours. Only when viewed under a lamp do they also look like date pits, because they are afraid of the light. I remember one day a cat was lying on the desk, and it was exactly noon. I called it to the back porch to test it, and its eyes were only slightly thin. When I turned it to face the south window, it closed its eyes tightly, and when I pried them open, they immediately shrank into a line. Another day, the weather was gloomy with wind and rain, and it was also noon, but its eyes were still round. The same noon time but different due to sunny or rainy weather, the same day but different due to the brightness or darkness of the place. One can understand the principle. The ancients' song for telling time was based on what they saw and extrapolated to the night, but they never actually tested it in detail.'"</p>
<p>"According to my understanding, Mengwei's statement is quite reasonable. 'Youyang Miscellaneous Morsels' says: 'The cat's eyes are round in the morning and evening, and contract vertically like a thorn at noon.' So the ancients were indeed just speaking generally."</p>
<p>Recently, I saw Ba Lingjun's "Land Sundial of Life" article (see the previous "Children's Weekly"), which also says that cat's eyes can tell time. It is said with certainty, but it seems to be lying to children.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Anecdotes about Qihuang (Traditional Chinese Medicine) <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Yimei</p>
<p>Whether in cities or villages, in prosperous or remote places, there is no place where you cannot see a doctor's sign. Indeed, the relationship between medicine and human life is too close, with an inseparable connection. I usually have many interesting anecdotes about Qihuang, so I am recording them here to help with conversation.</p>
<p>Du Shan's Jin Xiaoyan was friends with the famous doctor Chuan Zhitin. Jin was poor and unable to support himself and loved orchids. Ting had dozens of pots of orchids in his garden. One winter, he was ill and unable to take care of himself, and the orchid buds that grew in the autumn were completely frozen and unable to open. Jin did not recover from his illness until the summer of the following year. One day, Fu came to see him and saw the frozen orchid buds in the garden still standing upright, not removed. He was touched and said to Xiaoyan: "You are in a difficult situation. Now there is a way to make you slightly richer." Jin asked him what it was. Fu said: "You should quickly collect all the frozen orchid buds in the garden. They are now dry and will not rot again. A certain official is greedy and unkind. His son is now ill and trusts me very much. He has taken several doses of medicine, and it will probably take a hundred doses to work. In the future, when I prescribe medicine, I will use frozen orchid buds as a medicinal guide. He will not be able to find them anywhere, and I can tell him that you have a collection and ask him to buy them. Ask for a high price, and he will not be stingy for the sake of his son." Later, a certain official did come to buy frozen orchid buds, at a price of two qian per bud, which was later increased to one tael of silver per bud. The last three buds were sold for ten taels of silver. In total, Jin earned more than ninety taels, which provided him with several months of food.</p>
<p>The imperial physician of Menghe treated Empress Dowager Cixi's illness. He first bribed the eunuch to see the prescriptions of the Imperial Hospital for several days. Ten out of ten were tonics. He knew the reason for the phlegm and shortness of breath. So he personally decocted the medicine and presented it to Cixi. After taking it, Cixi's condition improved day by day, and she rewarded him generously. He returned and said to his best friend: "What I gave was just radish juice."</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Tu'e is a novelist and a physician. Therefore, he often elaborates on the principles of medicine in his martial arts novels. Therefore, some people say that he medicalizes his novels. Recently, he edited and compiled "New Talk on National Medicine" for Xiaojing Mountain House. After it was published, he graciously sent me a copy. After reading it, I found it very interesting. It turned out that he was writing medical books using the method of writing novels, thus fictionalizing medicine. Tu'e excels at both, no wonder he can achieve such a wonderful combination of the two.</p>

<p>Chapter Fifteen: Bitterly Earnest Advice Does Not Fall Flat, the Sound of Money and Shadows Sell People</p>
<p>I only heard Mrs. Hu say that this is not a business, and it's not very meaningful to talk about it every day. We are just repeating the first few sentences. Bei Hai's heart stirred, and he didn't want to leave. In the middle of the room, there was a skylight covered by an awning, with a long table in the middle, with several newspapers placed on it for people to read at will. Bei Hai turned his back to the window and leaned on the table to read the newspaper, taking the opportunity to listen to what they were saying. Jia Duocai continued, "It's not that I'm slow to act, it's because you're not efficient. That day, I was very happy and invited him to dinner. He rolled around in the mud and slept on Mr. Cheng's bed for half a day." Mrs. Hu interrupted, "Oh! What's the big deal, Mr. Cheng wasn't in the house." Jia Duocai said, "I don't care about that, why haven't I seen him since that day?" Mrs. Hu said, "Firstly, he's a little embarrassed about that day. Secondly, Master Jia has been very busy these past few days and is rarely at home, so he hasn't come." Jia Duocai said, "Even if what you say is reasonable, why isn't he here today?" Yang Huanhua said, "You should also forgive him. He's a young girl. It's always sitting in front of people and listening to others talk about his marriage. If things were settled with just one word, that would be fine. But no matter how much you talk about it, it's always unsuccessful. Think about it, it's always a bit embarrassing for a girl." Jia Duocai said, "What's embarrassing, he's slept naked on Mr. Cheng's bed. Now let's say a straight word, I can't manage his family. How much money does he want for his freedom? Mrs. Hu, go back and ask. If the price is not too high, we can naturally negotiate. If the price is too high, we'll end this matter and I won't care about it anymore." (245)</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>I pondered deeply, and it took me a long time to stop. When I raised my head, I happened to see the row of halls built on the side of Longevity Hill, so I remembered again! I thought: the metaphor I just made is really close to the truth. – Because those great palaces covered with yellow tiles can very well represent the Manchu Qing Empire. In fact, the Manchu Qing Empire is indeed the Empress Dowager's nanny; so she can now be regarded as a child playing on a boat, guarded by his nanny. However, this child is too precious, and in addition to this great nanny in spirit, there are also many teachers, tutors, and governesses to take care of her, so that she does not suffer any harm.</p>
<p>I was about to think again when the Empress Dowager finished her special lunch and said in a tone of admiration:</p>
<p>"Today, we can truly be said to be extremely happy!" She rinsed her mouth and said: "This suddenly reminded me of the words of our great sage Confucius, who said 'extreme joy is not permissible' and 'extreme joy produces sorrow'? Other ancient people also said that worries and joys often take turns to deal with people; so I think that after we have such excessive joy today, immediately, or in an hour, or later, tomorrow, perhaps that god of creation will inevitably tease us again!"</p>
<p>These words of hers, once sent into my eardrums, had a great impact, causing me to palpitate involuntarily, and I was worried that she would cause herself trouble; fortunately, she just said it orally and did not turn joy into sorrow. I think that her intention was probably because although she felt that this kind of concern was not without credibility, she also knew that such a relaxed and happy time was really not easy for her to obtain; so she had the idea of ​​living for the moment, and waiting for the god of creation to come up with some mystery tomorrow before dealing with it.

<h3 id="e190">Quick Sketches of the Cocoon Market <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— (Meng Shuzu)</p>
<p>I. The usually quiet cocoon trade has suddenly become lively.</p>
<p>As usual, this scene should be exciting, comforting, and filled with smiling faces, whether from the seller or the buyer.</p>
<p>But this year, everything is an exception.</p>
<p>"A price of eighteen or nineteen yuan per 'dan' of cocoons, I'm not exaggerating, there's no profit to be had!" An old farmer with a face full of wrinkles grumbled. "I estimated these two baskets of cocoons would sell for six yuan and six jiao, but after arguing to the death, I only got five yuan and five jiao. Redeeming rice means I can't redeem clothes, and redeeming clothes means I can't redeem rice." Another person sighed and muttered to themselves.</p>
<p>The cocoon merchants are so anxious, lowering the price day after day, but the goods are still not being pushed. If they don't collect enough goods, they're sure to lose money. The clerks, who were originally the most arrogant, can't muster any energy in this atmosphere.</p>
<p>The most disappointed are the small food stalls on both sides. Only these few sell food to the cocoon sellers, and these few are so stingy. One by one, they walk past quickly, as if embarrassed, trying their best to avoid the stall owners' gaze.</p>
<p>Excitement, comfort, smiling faces – all have become a dream of the past, leaving no impression on this year's cocoon market. Sericulture has indeed failed.</p>

<h3 id="e191">A Murdered Woman (Part 1) <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— You Aimei</p>
<p>In this era where suicide cases seem to increase daily, my cousin, Zhu Qingzhang, also hanged herself two months ago. This tragic news only reached me recently through a letter from my mother. My friendship with her was like that of siblings, so naturally, I felt extraordinary sorrow and couldn't help but shed tears. At the same time, I feel that her suicide is somewhat different from that of ordinary people because I know that she fell into an unfortunate situation due to the man-eating ethics and that she walked toward the path of demise because of the oppression of feudal society. Therefore, I believe that on the surface, she is a suicide victim, but in reality, she is a murdered one!</p>
<p>Her background is truly pitiful. Although she was born into a middle-class family with a passable life, the family was entirely structured like something out of the seventeenth century. Every man, woman, old and young, possessed a stubborn mind and a solemn face. To top it off, she lost her father early, leaving only a widowed mother who was kind and loving. As for the rest, whether it was her grandfather, grandmother, uncle, or aunt, she dared not say a word. Therefore, from a young age, she was confined in this ashen atmosphere, losing all her naturalness and vivacity, and developing a gentle temperament and a timid will. No matter what kind of embarrassment she suffered, she could only cry in secret to resolve it.</p>
<p>Even more unfortunate, not long after her father died, her mother began to cough up blood. Because her father suffered from lung disease, there was some suspicion that she had been infected. At that time, her mother moaned in bed, looking at her and her younger sister, thinking to herself, "If I fall ill and am unable to recover, leaving these two weak daughters behind, they will definitely not have a good life. It's better to make arrangements early and betroth them to families, considering it their path to survival." Under this thought, she hastily entrusted a matchmaker to betroth her to a Xu family in Linxi Village. Later, her mother did not die, and no one would have thought that this had created a major mistake regarding her life. Thus, the greatest tragedy of her life unfolded scene by scene:</p>
<p>Her husband, surnamed Xu, was a dandy from the countryside. He had not received a family education, resulting in a perverse temperament and improper behavior. After becoming an adult, his father once sent him to a middle school in Nanjing, but he dropped out in less than a year, so there was no way to talk about academics. However, he also had his specialties: eating, dressing, whoring, and gambling. He was proficient in all four areas. At that time, he had already become involved with a village girl and often made a scene in front of his mother, demanding to break off the engagement with his fiancée and marry his lover. Later, these rumors spread to her family. Her mother also regretted it very much. However, the society in Bao'ying upheld ancient morals, and the Zhu family was known for its literary tradition! Breaking off the engagement would be detrimental to social morals and shame the family. As for whether the boy was good or bad, it was not a problem. A chicken should follow a chicken, and a dog should follow a dog; besides, he was still a person, after all. Moreover, as long as her daughter had good luck, he would naturally become a good person after marrying into his family. Therefore, she tried her best to compromise. As a result, on the day of Qingming Festival, taking advantage of the bustling atmosphere of everyone following the tradition of strolling in Songgang, her mother pretended to take her out for a stroll, but secretly had the matchmaker lead her husband past them, pointing him out for him to see her appearance. As expected, her husband, because she was more beautiful than his lover, abandoned the village girl and eagerly set a date to marry her.</p>

<h3 id="e193">Fujian Province Discusses Methods for Implementing Compulsory Education <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>(Fuzhou Correspondence) The central task of education in Fujian Province for the 24th year of the Republic (i.e., starting in July of this year) has been defined as promoting compulsory education and implementing mandatory literacy. Recently, the Department of Education, as the new year is about to begin, convened a discussion meeting on the 17th for education administrative personnel of various counties. Attendees included Zheng Zhenwen, Director of the Department of Education; Xu Shifeng, Counselor of the Provincial Government; Zheng Tan, Zhu Hanchuan, and Tang Shouqian, Section Chiefs of the Department of Education; He Erong and Wang Shuxian, Supervisors; Weng Zaihao and Xue Yidan, Clerks; Zheng Zhensen, Chai Lian, and Wu Lianlian, Directors of the Compulsory Education Committee; and education section chiefs from various counties, totaling 76 people. After performing the formalities, Director Zheng reported the purpose of the meeting and the process of contacting the central government for compulsory education funding, stating that the national treasury would subsidize one-third, the provincial treasury would subsidize one-third, and the counties would raise one-third, totaling approximately 375,000 yuan annually. It is proposed to establish a provincial and county compulsory education committee to handle the matter. After the report, discussions began on (1) the draft implementation details for compulsory education, totaling sixteen articles. It was resolved that after the Ministry's "Provisional Outline for the Implementation of Compulsory Education Nationwide" is sent to the province, this provincial single-line method will be submitted to the Provincial Government for approval and promulgation; (2) the draft implementation details for compulsory education, totaling thirty articles. It was resolved that the 8th article regarding teacher qualifications, the 12th article regarding private schools, the 17th article regarding the adoption of a class-based teaching system in short-term primary schools, the 23rd article regarding the treatment of teachers in short-term primary schools, and the 28th article regarding penalties for compulsory enrollment of children should all be revised; (3) the estimation of the number of short-term primary schools in each county was discussed. It was resolved that the estimation would be made after each section chief returned to their county to investigate the number of out-of-school children; (4) the establishment of graduation standards for compulsory education and the holding of exams for exemption from education were discussed. It was resolved that because Article 26 of the draft implementation details for compulsory education already provides for exemption methods, this proposal would be reserved. In addition, regarding vocational education, (1) the organizational law of the county compulsory literacy committee, (2) the use of the baojia system to promote social and popular education, and regarding social education, the question of whether to continue or discontinue the popular schools that have already been established after the implementation of compulsory literacy education, were all discussed in detail. Subsequently, thirteen points regarding general local education administration to be paid attention to were reported: (1) reorganizing education funding, (2) hiring qualified teachers, (3) increasing the salaries of primary school teachers, (4) earnestly implementing the teaching of the national language, (5) emphasizing physical education and school hygiene, (6) holding scholarships for poor students, (7) planning vocational schools and supplementary schools, (8) county governments should cooperate with normal school districts to study the status of teachers and guide primary schools, (9) district offices should be used to handle education supervision and urge supervisors to conduct universal inspections, (11) rigorously implement primary school sampling tests, (12) report various statistics and school status reports on time, and (13) plan for children's equality. Finally, Supervisor Wang Shuxian raised five points that should be paid attention to in education in various counties: (1) pay attention to rural education, (2) fill enrollment quotas, (3) pay attention to the equipment of vocational schools, (4) study teaching methods, and (5) the number of schools should be evenly distributed.

<h3 id="e198">Ministry of Education Orders Improvement of Vocational Education in Fujian Province <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued an order on the 20th to the Department of Education of Fujian Province, stating that according to the report on the inspection of vocational education in the province submitted by Inspectors Dai Xia, Special Commissioner Sun Guofeng, the number of vocational schools in the province is too small, and the content is not substantial enough to meet the needs. The subjects offered do not pay attention to the improvement of local agricultural and industrial industries, and improvements should be made. Furthermore, the province's previous submission of the establishment and funding allocation methods for secondary schools in the 23rd year of the Republic still included plans to establish a Putian agricultural vocational school, which has not yet been implemented. Earnest planning and implementation should also be carried out to meet the establishment and funding allocation standards for secondary schools on schedule. The relevant points for improvement are listed below for compliance and reporting:</p>
<p>(1) The improvement of various industries in the province is urgently needed, but the establishment of existing vocational schools is not sufficient to meet the needs. The actual situation should be considered, and schools should be established in accordance with the standards promulgated by the Ministry, using provincial funds, and at the same time, cities and private secondary schools should be supervised to establish or reorganize schools. (2) Existing provincial vocational schools place too much emphasis on industry, and the civil engineering subject is in high demand due to highway construction. However, except for one agricultural school, all vocational schools have this subject, and the future career paths of students will inevitably become a problem. The actual situation of various civil engineering projects in the region should be used as a standard for training technical personnel in this area. (3) Provincial vocational schools of an industrial nature have generally failed to focus on improving and promoting local crafts. Efforts should be made to establish them within the realm of possibility. (4) The majority of people in the province are engaged in agriculture, and agricultural development is lagging behind. The training of agricultural vocational talent is an urgent task. However, besides the Putian agricultural vocational school, which is still under preparation, there is only one Fuzhou senior agricultural vocational school in the province, which is insufficient to meet the needs. The Putian vocational school should be strictly supervised to ensure earnest preparation and establishment. At the same time, the industrial situation in various regions should be considered, and agricultural vocational schools should be added as soon as possible. (5) Existing provincial vocational schools have different histories and generally offer a wide range of subjects. The department should reorganize them based on local needs, focusing on centralized management as a principle. (6) It is estimated that the province needs 20 senior vocational school teachers in both agriculture and industry. It is proposed to send students to study at universities abroad, but for the sake of convenience, domestic colleges and universities can also be entrusted to provide training. (7) The distribution of academic and practical courses in the curricula of a small number of vocational schools differs from the standards promulgated by the Ministry. Corrections should be made and earnestly implemented in accordance with the standards. (8) The Fuzhou Senior Agricultural Vocational School has rural courses and the equipment is not substantial. The school is located in the city and has little contact with the rural environment. Efforts should be made to relocate the school to the suburbs and improve the equipment to improve the efficiency of education. Graduates face considerable difficulty finding jobs and should be assisted. According to the school's plan, canning manufacturing and horticultural seedlings, etc., should be added, and the school has made considerable achievements in raising livestock in recent years. It seems that the scope of the agriculture and forestry courses can be reduced and the focus shifted to agricultural manufacturing and by-products. (9) The Fuzhou Industrial Vocational School is generally well-managed, and the equipment is impressive. However, it has been established for a long time, and there has been a slight lack of supplementation over the years. The budget should be used to increase equipment expansion costs as much as possible, and the content should be enriched as much as possible, with electrical engineering, machinery, and civil engineering as the foundation. The manufacturing factories should also pay attention to the production and marketing of common commodities on the market. (10) The Fuzhou Vocational School has a considerable foundation, but it offers industrial, commercial, household affairs, midwifery, and nursing courses, and there are an equal number of male and female students. The allocation of equipment and the implementation of moral education are more difficult. The number of courses should be reduced, and training should be centralized. (11) The Xiamen Vocational School offers commercial courses, which are well-suited to local needs. Efforts should be made to find more internship opportunities for students to increase their experience. If necessary, women's vocational courses such as household affairs and sewing can be added. (12) The private Hui'er Yuan has achieved good results in lacquer work and rattan work. In the future, the styles and structures should be further improved. This order is issued.</p>

<h3 id="e200">Zhejiang Department of Education Promulgates Measures for the Examination of Vocational School Internships, Divided into Four Categories: Agriculture, Industry, Commerce, and Home Affairs <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Department of Education believes that internships in vocational schools are most important. Article 36 of the regulations for vocational schools promulgated by the Ministry stipulates that "internships should account for 50% in principle," and Article 41 stipulates that "the teaching of each subject in vocational schools should be based on the principle of practical training first and then lecturing." It can be seen that internships are extremely important in the curricula of vocational schools at all levels. Recently, it has been found that vocational schools at all levels have not paid much attention to internships, and there are no concrete examination measures for students' internship time on weekdays, so that the theory and practice learned by students cannot be combined, which has a profound impact on students' vocational skills. Therefore, the Zhejiang Department of Education has specially promulgated interim measures for the examination of vocational school internships, divided into four categories: agriculture, industry, commerce, and home affairs. Students who fail the internship examination shall not be allowed to graduate. A notice is issued to all city and county governments for compliance.</p>

Recently, it has created blind script and sign language, which has been initially approved by the association's committee. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Creating Blind Script and Sign Language: Recognizing the lack of uniformity in written language teaching in schools for the blind and deaf nationwide, the association specifically entrusted officers in various regions to conduct detailed investigations. The types of scripts are extremely diverse, encompassing both Chinese and Western styles, deemed unsuitable. Therefore, a committee was specifically organized to compile blind script and sign language, and it was decided to conduct preliminary trials. It is planned to recruit a number of deaf students to teach sign language and a number of blind students to teach blind script during the summer vacation this year. If the results are excellent, a request will be submitted to the Ministry of Education to issue an order for adoption by blind and deaf schools nationwide, it is said.</p>
<p>Summer Training in National Language: In order to assist teachers and staff of elementary schools in the Shanghai Nanshi area in utilizing the summer vacation to study standard Mandarin, the association is specifically organizing summer Mandarin training courses in both locations.

It is reported that the Shanghai course will commence on July 10th, and the Nanjing course will commence on July 11th, lasting for five weeks.</p>
<p>Elementary School Speech Contest: The association is scheduled to hold the Hankou Elementary School Students Speech Contest at the Hankou Civic Education Center on the 23rd of this month.

<p>Zhonghua Vocational School: The Xiaoximen Zhonghua Vocational School has two departments, industry and commerce. The industrial department is divided into mechanical and civil engineering. There is a mechanical practice workshop in the school. Other facilities such as surveying instruments, architectural specimens, and models are well-equipped. More than a thousand graduates have served in society. The school's business department has always accepted female students. It is now reported that the industrial department will also accept female students starting from this summer. In Europe and the United States, it is very common for women to study and serve in mechanical and civil engineering technical work, but in our country, it is still an innovation. From now on, it can greatly increase the opportunities for women in our country to serve and employ, promote equality between men and women, and especially promote the important initiative of industrial culture in our country, opening up the depressing atmosphere of recent years. In the midst of this national crisis, it is a good phenomenon.</p>

<p>The gold market, stable then firm yesterday, broke through the 80-yuan mark, thoroughly stirring up strong buying sentiment, with the public mood extremely robust.  Rumors spread within the market, suggesting a particularly favorable trend.  Despite continuous reports of increases in Indian silver, sentiment remained unmoved.  In the morning, influenced by the overseas silver market, with declines in both the UK and US, traders claimed that the US would increase by .0625 after the market closed, making large purchases, and that there were some transactions above the closing price of 1.25, causing some selling.  In the London forward silver market, declines ranged from 3.5 to 5.7 percent.  Exchange rate fluctuations were minimal.  London raw gold fell 2.5 pence.  Reports stated that American bankers would force the government to implement silver policies, but these floated psychologically and failed to rally.

The banks’ buying appetite gradually revived, allowing the buying side to maintain strong support.  Finally, both the Hong Kong and Shanghai markets softened, stirring up a buying wave.  After breaking through the 80-yuan barrier, short sellers scrambled to cover, and the trend was firm at noon.  In the afternoon market, although Indian silver rose by 6.7 annas, it lacked much downward pressure, and sentiment was unusually robust.  Buying sentiment was particularly strong, and soon the market trended upward again.  Banks and brokers rushed to sell US dollars, rallying after falling back but mostly fluctuating.  Later, when Indian silver rose another 2 annas, there was still little downward pressure and strong support.  The Central Bank, etc., found it difficult to raise prices again, so in the end, the bulls sold off slightly, causing a slight drop.

<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, due to the activation of arbitrage in the financial sector and large-scale absorption by two banks, the market situation changed rapidly. Therefore, retail investors who were waiting for an opportunity to move rose up to take action, with both short covering and new longs rising together. Each party detected a rebound and became even more energetic, but the key still lies in the current situation. This month's futures trading is already in the last three days, and the number of open positions has accumulated to a substantial 50 million. Both the bulls and bears have their own strengths. For the fourth position, the shorts in the twenty-second contract had over 3 million, in salt over 1 million, and in the forty-sixth contract over 1 million in the twenty-third contract, likely due to physical delivery. Contracts 32, 46, and 47 each had 1-2 million to 9 million. For the bulls, the fifty-fourth contract was the largest, taking in around 3 million short gold contracts in contracts 22 and 23, contract 16 absorbed over 2 million, with over 1 million in contract 22, and the twenty-first long position was around 2 million. Both sides' strengths are considerable. The market price resulted in a unanimous continuation of several jiao to one yuan and three jiao increases. The total transaction amount was 33.42 million.

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that yesterday (the 19th), the New York stock market experienced a reaction after a prolonged rise, and prices subsequently fell. Utility stocks rebounded because it was expected that the utility company management case of Wheeler Reyburn would be leniently amended. However, the abolition of industry regulations by the copper industry caused panic, and copper stocks plummeted. Soon, the decline spread to the entire market, and speculators believed that the market had bought too much recently, followed the trend, and engaged in selling. At the close, large investments were bought in, causing a slight increase. The price market had little fluctuation, and small exchange stocks were mixed with fatigue. The total daily transaction volume was 1.63 million shares. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left:</p>

<p>The yarn market trended stronger, and the price surge started abruptly, because of continued decline that triggered large-scale buying to cover shorts by those obtaining profits. At the same time, rumours abounded in the commercial market, and sales of the yarn soared. When trading opened yesterday, the market's momentum was greatly buoyed. Information gathered, the Henan guild bought several thousand bales of 17-count yarn, which had been previously sold around the middle of last week.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Up One Yuan and Three Jiao</p>
<p>In the morning, trading in the cotton yarn futures market had been sluggish across various months, because the overseas cotton market was quiet and the daily report continued to fall two yuan outside the market, so the market had few changes. When the market was auctioned for the 2nd and 3rd sessions, short positions scrambled to cover their positions. The market strengthened slightly until closing. The spot yarn market continued to be buoyant, with increased price. The results of prices across all months at closing were uniformly higher by three, four or seven jiao compared to the previous day. When trading began in the afternoon, the market condition appeared tight, rumours started to circulate that transactions were developing, and long positions were being built up, the Yueh guild's appetite for ten-count yarn sets remained good, other local guilds' actions were rare. Distant month foreign merchants came to the market to sell off. The results of prices across all months at closing were uniformly higher by seven, eight, or nine jiao to one yuan compared to the closing price in the morning. Reported sales of Dafulu one thousand one hundred bales, Dafeng one thousand bales, Changyu one thousand three hundred and fifty bales, Taichang one thousand three hundred bales, Run Kang one thousand two hundred bales Jifeng seven hundred and fifty bales, Suilong one thousand four hundred and fifty bales, Yuanda one thousand and fifty bales, Jun Chang one thousand five hundred bales, Yichang one thousand one hundred bales, Changfeng six hundred and fifty bales.

<p>The cotton market lacked deliveries this month, leading to the hedging of speculative positions, and distant months strengthened. On the other hand, in this time of economic emergency, recipients are still scarce, other than the stockpile of about 100,000 pieces of the Chenhuo Lingbao cotton.</p>
<p>Cotton Futures Short Covering</p>
<p>The opening prices in the cotton futures market this morning appeared on the expensive side in the local market, due to rumours of short squeezes this month, market sentiment looked strong, but long-term cotton prices fell due to rain, resulting in each month's prices rising five to two jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. This afternoon the market was still strong, due to the support from the cotton market, the speculative positions had to be balanced. As a result, prices in each month rose between one jiao and a half and three jiao compared to the previous closing price. Sales reported of Yicheng, one thousand loads, Renfeng one thousand seven hundred loads, Taixing one thousand loads, Yuanda one thousand six hundred loads, Dafu three thousand two hundred loads, Sui three thousand six hundred loads, Junchang five thousand two hundred loads, Taichang five thousand eight hundred loads, Yichang two thousand eight hundred loads, Yuanxingchang three thousand loads, Shuidai one thousand one hundred loads, Purchases reported of Mingde one thousand two hundred loads, Tongfu one thousand one hundred loads, Hexing two thousand eight hundred loads, Minghua one thousand one hundred loads, Gengfeng five thousand nine hundred loads, Xiecheng one thousand six hundred loads, Xinhua two thousand four hundred loads, Yifeng one thousand three hundred loads, Changfeng three thousand two hundred loads, Runkang two thousand one hundred loads, Changhe one thousand two hundred loads, High, low, and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market opened with steady prices. However, because of sales by Far East companies, and because the longs sold off on the basis of good weather, prices dropped. Subsequently, the weekly weather report stated that the weather in the western region was unfavourable, and at the same time, fellow merchants and New Orleans companies were buying, the market showed an upward trend, Liverpool was buying up for July futures, and Soviet Russia continued to be in a long position. However, demand was sluggish, the volume of transactions was small, the House of Representatives passed the Recovery Act, but this had no impact on the market, the market subsequently followed the grain market and dropped, and at the time of closing, short accounts were covered, which caused the market to be fairly strong. Spot prices did not move, futures prices rose by 1 to 2 pounds. U.K. cotton spot prices did not move, futures prices fell by 6 to 7 points, prices for Indian cotton fell due to the fact that the short accounts sold and the long volume of profits, due to beneficial rain in the cotton-growing regions, and these volumes were absorbed by merchants' needs. Pingguoer fell by 3.25 Rupees, Aomula fell by 3 to 3.25 Rupees, Bairuoxi fell by 3 to 3.75 Rupees. Original telex record below (electric telegram dated 19th).</p>

<p>After the opening price of flour, due to overnight rainy fog, the farmland was damp, market sentiment was unanimously soft, about one or two points lower than the previous day's closing price, and in this environment that was not smooth, the market did not really look stable. In the end, cargo from the factories was not strong, and a price drop was not easy either. Until the market opened this afternoon, and there was very little transaction volume, with only slightly more than 70,000 packages transacted half of the day. However, prices for the various items reversed into an increasing trend, market sentiment was stable, and when one observed the developments thereafter, if one saw buoyant sales of cloth, one would have to observe and solidify. The result was that this month did not move, July fell by 7.5 li, August fell by 1 point, September and October fell by 1 point, and November fell by half a point.</p>
<p>Due to the price quote for overseas wheat in the wheat market, Chicago Canada wheat both fell by 4 or 5 jiao. When the quote opened, the fall for overseas wheat was very high, and combined with damp rain, which sufficiently benefitted farmland, and although volume for each month was not high, the various months in the local markets were all soft, about three or four points lower than the previous day. Until the market adjusted this afternoon, the flour market appeared stable, and also the volume of cargo to hand was not buoyant, because harvest was taking place on farms, there was a limited capacity to transport the grain, so cargo on the market could not increase steadily. And because of this, market sentiment reversed into a firm stance. As a result, the prices for July and August performed one point better than the previous day, prices for September performed two points better, and prices for October performed three points better. The price for spot wheat: prime cargo was set, average and low grades had a price fall of two or three points, opening price for Kaiming Guangguan store wheat was three yuan four and a half jiao, Daqiao Wuyi wheat three yuan four jiao, Jiangxin Zhouzhenjiang wheat yuan three yuan three jiao half, Puyi town wheat three yuan three jiao two four points, and Hanzhou wheat three jiao two points, and the average price three jiao, Nanjing wheat three yuan three jiao one point, and secondary price one jiao seven points, Taiping wheat three yuan three jiao two points, Jiangyan wheat three yuan two jiao seven points, Hankou wheat three yuan, three yuan one jiao three points, Lujiabang Shipai wheat three yuan three jiao three points, Taicang wheat three yuan three jiao four points, and Penglai wheat three yuan three jiao two points, of which Fuxin took away 4,000 packages, Fufeng took away 3,000 packages, Shenda took away 1,500 packages, and Xinda took away 2,000 packages</p>
<p>Winnipeg Wheat (Canada) Mill was a soft market. The Balkans (Europe) and the Soviet Union had the feeling that wheat harvest would be greater than the previous year, so the buyers wanted to wait for the price to fall lower and move in. In regard to hedging, because the near and distant months are not very different at present, those who are long in July should swap over to December. Chicago Wheat June 18 June 19 Change</p>

<p>Local rice (Shanghai South): Although the supply from various merchants was small yesterday, only arriving at lots number seven and eight (a total of about 1,500-1,600 piculs), due to the continuous rain, people’s morale dampened, causing sluggish sales. The market was quiet, and prices for various thick japonica rice and late-season rice varieties fell by one to one and a half dimes. The overcast weather also presented a similar scene. (Shanghai North): There were over twenty arrivals; goods moved slowly. Due to the rain the previous night, which continued until yesterday morning, shops were quiet at the start of trading, resulting in sparse business. Market prices saw a slight drop of about a dime for white japonica rice and a small decrease of one to two dimes for early thin rice. The other goods also showed a weakening trend.</p>
<p>Imported rice: Both local and visiting merchants were hesitant. Because of the continuous heavy rain yesterday and the day before, the market remained cautious, and there was no activity from the Yangtze River merchants. The market continued to soften, with little trading throughout the day. Only over 4,000 bags of various imported rice were traded. Prices continued to decline by five to six cents to a dime. If the weather becomes suitable and rainfall is moderate, the market may need further adjustments.</p>

<h3 id="e231">Gogol's Words on Character Description <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Ding</p>
<p>In Gogol’s "The Overcoat," when writing about a character other than the protagonist Akaky Akakievich, he suddenly inserts this passage:</p>
<p>"Of course, there is no need to say much about this tailor, but since he has been mentioned, in order to fully and clearly describe the character of each person in the novel, there is no way but to talk about him here."</p>
<p>After introducing the tailor in a few sentences, when writing about the tailor's wife, he says:</p>
<p>"Since we have mentioned his wife, we must also say a few words about her."</p>
<p>This made me think a lot. Because when I read it at the time, it seemed like I had this feeling: this work is undoubtedly good; but in a work, when introducing characters, is it good to insert the author's "novel writing method" or similar opinions, and would this affect the integrity of the work? Of course, Gogol's era is far from us, and perhaps he had some feelings at the time that made him have to write that way; but when we read it now, we always feel that there is a need for research. After thinking for a while, it seemed that there was no result; however, it gave me another kind of inspiration: that is, Gogol's valuable opinions on writing novels. Now when I read his "Dead Souls," that opinion makes me see a very clear outline. At the beginning of "Chapter Two," he writes about the protagonist Chichikov's servants like this:</p>
<p>"It wouldn't be too much trouble to introduce the two servants of our main character to the reader here. Of course, they are not important figures, only so-called second- or third-rate people, and they have nothing to do with the backbone and significant development of this epic poem, at most touching it a little, or mentioning it briefly; -- but the author likes to be meticulous in everything..."</p>
<p>Therefore, it makes me think that most beginners often make such a mistake when writing: that is, they fail to describe the appearance and character of each character in the work--whether important or unimportant--in detail or briefly; they are always impatient and only care about the rapid development of the story, so that many characters are just written with a name and that's it. As a result, of course, it is easy to make people feel as if they are reading a "news chronicle" instead of a work of art. To cure this problem, I think Gogol's words are indeed the right medicine.</p>
<p>This is not all. Gogol further gives us more practical hints in "Dead Souls":</p>
<p>"Manilov then led his friend into the house. Passing through the gate, the front hall, and the dining room, although very quickly, we want to use this very short time, whether it can be done naturally is not certain, to talk about a few words about this owner. However, the author should state that such a plan is very difficult. It is easier to describe a character with a large stage. Here, we can only smear the paint on the canvas like this--shining black eyes, thick eyebrows, deep wrinkles on the forehead, and a black or blood-red coat solemnly draped over the shoulders--the small portrait is painted; however, such gentlemen who are everywhere and look very similar. Because we are used to seeing them, they probably all have some subtle, elusive characteristics--it is very difficult to draw portraits of these people. If you want these subtle, subtle characteristics to be in front of your eyes, you must pay special attention and use the eyes trained in identifying people to deeply shoot into the bottom of the spirit of people."</p>
<p>The last few sentences of this passage are very important. He paints a character for us to see; but he immediately points out that this is still not enough. The important thing is: to put those "subtle, elusive characteristics in front of your eyes," "and use the eyes trained in identifying people to deeply shoot into the bottom of the spirit of people."</p>
<h3 id="e232">Life <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Li Sanlang</p>
<p>Lying on the bed, the damaged canvas bed always crackles and pops incessantly, seemingly casting an odd shadow, stirring my weary mind, exhausted from the day's toil for life, a chaos of terrors. It's as if tragedy flickers in a rapidly moving film, scene after scene, now joyous, now painful, now tearful. It seems life has given me only terrifying shadows. Even when I climbed from the treacherous mountain paths to level ground, believing I could stride peacefully toward a beautiful countryside, that may have been just a dream. But as a child, I had many beautiful and lovely dreams, dreams of how great my future would be, dreams of my infinite happiness. Now, all of that has completely disappeared. Not only is there no chance to dream of the future, but life doesn't even let me dream. It seems even the courage to dream has vanished. Isn't that so? I descended from the high and dangerous mountain paths, and on the tranquil ground, I thought I could live peacefully. But this era is no longer so simple or ordinary. Before long, I felt that the tranquil environment was not really tranquil. In an instant, ahead was no longer flat land, but another terrifying mountain range, a boundless sea of raging waves, and the pangs of hunger and cold would once again descend upon me, the traveler. Thus, I must struggle again, hoping the sunlight will illuminate the earth, and I can slowly find my way in the middle. I must climb over dense mountain ranges, or encounter a raging ocean. I must find a light boat to cross the sea, drifting and drifting, crossing the terrifying ocean again.</p>
<p>And so, I constantly, every moment, tread this never-ending path of ups and downs, all for the sake of life, to avoid the whip of hunger and cold lashing me relentlessly. So, is there still the courage and opportunity to dream as I did in childhood?</p>
<p>Therefore, when I lie down on the canvas bed that is as awkward as I am, its old and torn crackling sounds seem to deliberately warn me, or imploringly sigh. However, because this journey has given me the taste of hunger and cold to a very deep degree, and after my constant running and jumping, I get this chance to lie down, lying on the damaged canvas bed, what mood do I have to care about its unfortunate situation? Of course, I treat its broken, sighing crackling sound as mixed in with my nightly life. The more I toss and turn, the more I cannot sleep peacefully, the more it crackles and pops incessantly. Of course, when it no longer has the strength to hold me up, I lie down on the cement floor.</p>
<p>Lying on the cement floor is the same as lying on the damaged canvas bed. I am always thinking about the day's running around, thinking about how to avoid hunger and cold. However, the ground is silent, with no echoing sound.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I must once again climb the high mountain, drifting across the ocean with an empty heart.</p>

<p>— Wei Zhongtian</p>
<p>Green fields, green sky, green branches, green sky...</p>
<p>Spring has long since gone so far away, spring has left this green world, everywhere is a patch of emerald green, a patch of azure blue, if not thinking about the burden of life is getting heavier day by day, this scenery will always make people a little happy.</p>
<p>The early summer breeze stirs up so many of my memories, these memories, half are lovable, half are hateful. ...</p>
<p>Since summer came to Tokyo, there have been two things that attract attention in society, that is, women's umbrellas and paper fans. Japanese women's umbrellas are really very particular, there are red ones, green ones, patterned ones, purple-blue ones, all kinds of things. I have never seen them before, I believe some people see these umbrellas, maybe they will associate with the beauty of women's youth. The June sun shines on the girl under the red umbrella, seems more beautiful, many people say, Japan's beautiful girls are too many.</p>
<p>As for that paper fan is also very particular, and small, and exquisite, looks always feel a special flavor. -- exotic flavor.</p>
<p>The early summer breeze makes people a little tired, making people feel the length of the day, the fatigue of life. In Shanghai, it must be very hot at this moment, but the weather is not hot in Tokyo, the wind is still so gentle across your face, did not think of the summer is terrible. Now the cicadas have not yet, but the mosquitoes are more and more every day.</p>

<p>— Liu Shi</p>
<p>Perhaps my tastes are a bit low, but I remember that those who have been to "Autumn Moon over the Calm Lake" always exaggerate the deliciousness of the spiced dried tofu sold there, but I don't feel that way. I can't taste its so-called "deliciousness." Perhaps it's because I didn't pair it with a cup of real Longjing tea, didn't open a pot of "Nine Creeks and Eighteen Gorges" water, and didn't have an ancient porcelain cup! No! Not only do I lack these things, but I probably also lack a bright and clean window like Mr. Zhitang's Bitter Rain Studio, a leisurely pastoral heart, and two or three connoisseurs who can taste tea and distinguish flavors! Eating, for us common people, is mostly just filling our stomachs. The taste and smell of our tongues are probably less capable than those of refined people. Therefore, the dried tofu that I love to eat is actually a kind of stinky tofu that can be bought on the streets every day. Spend two coppers, stand by the oil pot, use a bamboo skewer to pick a piece into the pot, add a little spicy sauce, and send it hot into my mouth, I feel very appetizing. If I have one or two silver coins in my pocket, buy ten or eight pieces and bring them home for dinner, wouldn't that be the ultimate delicacy for the poor? As for whether it is hygienic or not, I have never examined it, because I have eaten it for half my life, but I have never suffered any serious illness, so I will unscientifically assume that it does not harm hygiene! Yes, before I have the good fortune to go to "Autumn Moon over the Calm Lake," and before I have the leisurely mood to carefully chew spiced hygienic dried tofu, let's not overthrow those stinky tofu stalls for the time being! That's how I personally think.</p>
<p>However, these stinky tofu stalls may offend the noses of people with "high-class tastes," which is not surprising.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhitang compares "the scientific essays that are clamoring today" to "so-called hygienic stinky tofu." This is to say that stinky tofu is inherently unhygienic, and now adding the word "hygienic" is a contradictory humor, isn't it? But why not think that Mr. Zhitang is opposed to scientific essays, just as Mr. Zhitang is not opposed to dried tofu. What Mr. Zhitang opposes is only "what is clamoring today." He admires Wilde's "Natural History of Selborne," Fabre's "Souvenirs Entomologiques," and Thomson's "Secrets of Animal Life" very much, and laments that "it cannot be found in that "Siku Quanshu", it is truly rare and precious." "If we want to see some scientific essays, we still have to borrow from foreign countries for the time being." Is it difficult to say that Mr. Zhitang is still opposed to scientific essays? Yes, the same dried tofu, some can be used for elegant people to taste tea, and some can be used to fill the stomachs of hungry people. What Mr. Zhitang opposes is clearly the kind of scientific essays that cannot be used for discussion in the Bitter Rain Studio, which is also clear.</p>
<p>"I don't know what so-called scientific essays are. According to me, this should be something that dreams of science and has the dream of writing." Although this generally seems to explain something, it is actually vague. Scientific essays, in today's sense, cannot be such an abstract thing. If it is a scientific explanation of the practice of observation, or a fragment of scientific writing, then, in order to express the scientific truth fully, the language must be popular and have the appealing literary quality of a work of art. Therefore, although Fabre's and Thomson's masterpieces are worthy of being respected as spiced hygienic dried tofu, in today's China, objectively speaking, they are only things for scholars to discuss or for authors to study, and cannot fill the empty stomachs on the streets. The scientific essays currently needed cannot borrow from others' light, but must use scientific laws to explain the phenomena that are pressing down on everyone's heads. These observations, which are pressing us tightly, belong to society, so even if things that specifically write about the lives of insects and animals are beautiful, they are only tea snacks, not a main meal. "Why does a scholar who has painted a few strokes of ink plum blossoms" necessarily "go and write about famous paintings of the Renaissance"? Can't Chinese scientific essays rely on their own practice to create?</p>
<p>As for saying that people who are not scientists like Fabre and do not have such writing skills "should refrain from moving their honorable hands," isn't this clearly canceling people's efforts? I am not going to accept this. It's pitiful to say that the so-called "scientific essays that are clamoring today" are still in their infancy, and there are no good products, but it is also a fact, but the trend clearly shows that they are growing. Because the practice of life has determined its development, whether in content or form, it cannot become the spiced tofu for elegant scholars to taste tea in the Bitter Rain Studio, so it can only be temporarily regarded as "stinky tofu" and sold on the streets! Therefore, Mr. Zhitang's satire on us is not considered harsh or unbearable. Instead, it takes off the noble coat of scientific essays.</p>
<p>Can things sold on the streets be unprepared for hygiene? That's not true. Stinky tofu is, after all, a satirical metaphor. What scientific essayists must guard against is having toxins, not only should we be careful about the stinky, but also pay attention to the fragrant and sweet! Fragrant things can also be poisonous. Therefore, adding the word "hygienic" to stinky tofu is really wonderfully like soy sauce.</p>

<p>— Written by German author Storm, translated by Chen Yinzhi</p>
<p>At this moment, I discovered that Nellie was wearing a set of light-colored wool clothes with flowers tonight. Like the previous one, this set was probably also taken from the mayor's wife's closet, because last winter, the mayor's wife's broad chest and copper-purple complexion, matched with this set of colored rose clothes, actually caused others to feel a little funny. But now this style is just in vogue; the bright and dark-skinned girl's face matches this set of clothes very well.</p>
<p>After the "Mazurka" was over, Nellie let her head and thin arms droop again, and I sent her to her seat. Fritz and Charlotte had also just come out of the dance floor and were sitting near us. Just at this moment, Mrs. Polica also came over with cakes and tea; she did not speak to her daughter, but gave her a smiling and proud look, as if to show that she would serve her tea and cakes after serving them to that noble lady. The noble lady had been looking at these two mothers and daughters for a while with her unique lazy expression. "Your daughter is very beautiful tonight, Mrs. Polica!" she said, while putting sugar in her teacup.</p>
<p>The complimented lady bowed humbly, "Thank you, miss, this is also thanks to the mayor's wife's care."</p>
<p>"Oh ha! — So that's how it is! That set of rose clothes!" She then cast a long glance at Nellie. Nellie wanted to look back at her, but her eyes were already dim; I saw how a pair of tears rolled down her cheeks.</p>
<p>Charlotte seemed not to have seen it; her attention turned to the open doorway: I was taken aback, because I saw the French tailor's yellow face also appearing among the spectators in the crowd. He seemed to be very happy, and the snuffbox was being turned over and over in his hand. His black eyes looked happily into the hall.</p>
<p>"Is that your father, Miss Nellie?" Charlotte said, pointing outside the door.</p>
<p>Rena Li looked out and couldn't help but tremble all over. "Mother!" she shouted, unconsciously grabbing the arm of the old lady who was still serving guests in front of us.</p>
<p>Mrs. Polica also saw her husband, who was so happy that he was gesticulating, at this time, and she was not happy, but she cheered up. "He came from the inn," she said, "He came to see you dance."</p>
<p>Nellie walked towards the door, and I unconsciously followed her; when she approached the door, the mayor had already walked to her father and invited him into the hall for a glass of sugar wine. But the tailor refused to move. "Thank you, I am your loyal servant, Mr. Mayor!" he said, while bending his back and taking a step back. "I wish I could be like my grandfather, who served in the court of Louis XVI! I know my place very well!"</p>

<h3 id="e237">Banning the "Cherish Paper" Associations <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>Recently, the China Paperboard Manufacturers Association submitted a report to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, requesting the ban of "Cherish Paper" associations in various places. This report, coming from the mouths of business operators, naturally speaks of the great principle of "eliminating bad habits and cherishing material resources." Perhaps it also contains a lot of "business acumen," but "respecting and cherishing written paper," in itself, is a kind of "fetishism" and should have been criticized by people long ago. It is only because of a strange idea that has always existed in our country, that square characters are the relics of sages, and all people who are "scholarly and of the same flesh and blood" should respect, cherish, and pray to them, otherwise they would blaspheme the sages and be condemned by Heaven. The "characters," a linguistic tool created by Cangjie in the past, could not have anticipated that they would be regarded by later "scholars" as something that could "suppress demons and ward off evil."</p>
<p>Besides trying their best to quibble over words in order to show off their mysteriousness, "respecting and cherishing written paper" is also one of their actual practices. Looking at how "scholars" of the past treated written paper, they not only could not throw it away anywhere, but also had to gather it together and burn it, and throw the ashes into the sea. This was definitely not for cleanliness and hygiene, but was actually no different from the secretive behavior of people of "heretical ways and odd methods" who manipulated their own incantations and seals. The former "deceives the public with false words," while the latter dazzles fools with his own knowledge.</p>
<p>The report from the China Paperboard Manufacturers Association allows us to see that there is still such a latent force in our society. The government's ban on them is indeed a happy event for eliminating old customs and superstitions, but we also have a further wish, which is how to find a way to break the superstitions of a small number of "scholars," because history shows us that this strange thing not only produces many evils, but also has a not small relationship with the country and the nation.</p>

<p>— Ge Bai</p>
<p>It seems that a movie star was the first to wear sunglasses in public places, but now fashionable women each have a pair, which has become a common phenomenon. In Shanghai, movie stars always take the lead in fashion, and wearing sunglasses is a fashionable trend.</p>
<p>Reading Suzhou ballad novels, I know that the Chinese have long had something called "single lenses." Nowadays, British ladies have changed to using "double lenses" instead. That kind of way of looking at people always lacks generosity. However, changing them into the style of eyeglasses, the nose and ears are initially subjected to a kind of unexpected restraint. Moreover, when someone suddenly pops out from the side street, looking at them through the edge of the glasses, it's almost like a Mount Tai pressing down, often leading to a bit of helplessness. I myself unfortunately suffer from extreme nearsightedness. I remember when I was in middle school, my seat gradually moved from the back row to the front row, but the words on the blackboard were always so distant. I had to squint my eyelids into a line to make out a blurry outline. I had long refused to get a pair of glasses. Many of my classmates wore glasses, but I never wanted my nose and ears to be clamped by that kind of hard thing. Later, a science teacher gave a very detailed explanation about the eyeballs. Worried about going blind in the future, I secretly got a pair, but still put them in my pocket after class. This was because there was an even bigger reason involved.</p>
<p>At that time, wearing glasses was considered fashionable. Anyone who had read chapter novels would never forget that when a suave young man appeared on stage, the author would at least write about a pair of gold-rimmed glasses on his face. Even in the "Tale of Laughter and Tears," which was popular for a time, it is said that the author even used a pair of glasses and a fountain pen as foreshadowing for Fengxi's change of heart. Wouldn't I be worried about being a romantic figure myself when this beautiful ornament was discovered on my nose? Moreover, classmates would never let you go, asking you with a special attitude, "Are you wearing glasses?" clearly mocking you for trying to be fashionable. Then, after sacrificing my nose and ears, and also sweating on my back, wouldn't it be a happy thing to see a little less? Moreover, the highest secret of the art of living is to not see and not ask! As for finally putting them on my nose later, it was truly unspeakable pain. Initially, when I couldn't see things, I could squint my eyelids. After borrowing the power of that concave glass to help with my insufficient eyeballs, even when I thought I could see very clearly before, I couldn't help but take them out of my pocket and put them on my nose, hoping to see even more clearly. Over time, it became a habit. When people asked me, "Are you wearing glasses?" I could interpret it as a question of sympathy, and I would naturally answer calmly, "Nearsighted!"</p>
<p>However, whether it's Tolick, Crookes, or glass lenses, they are always white. When teachers wore sunglasses during exams, they were inevitably cursed by students as "cruel ghosts." Fortune tellers wear dark glasses, and everyone knows they are blind, while new brides are recognized as having this right. In the past, young girls were shy, and when so many people were teasing the newlyweds in the bridal chamber, she could borrow two pieces of black glass to avoid those frivolous gazes. The sales of other sunglasses were minimal.</p>
<p>Last summer, I learned from advertisements about an invention called mirror-outside-mirror. The most sensational words in the advertisement were that it could "protect the eyes." But first, close your eyes and think: wearing glasses in the summer is already the most painful thing. If one pair is not enough, and you put on another pair, even if your nose and ears are not afraid of sacrifice, wouldn't it be too much trouble when sweat drips down from your forehead? Although my own eyeballs are not up to par, this kind of well-intentioned compulsion seems too much!</p>
<p>Now that sunglasses are all the rage, because I don't want to spend extra money to get a pair of sunglasses with the same degree of nearsightedness, I don't agree that this is the only way to avoid strong sunlight, unless it's to be fashionable, of course.</p>

<p>— Ping</p>
<p>The high cost of housing in Shanghai seems to be self-evident. Although nine out of ten houses are empty now, rental prices still refuse to "drop and sell cheaply." As a result, the so-called "Shikumen" houses are filled with people like pigsties. As a low-income earner, I am undoubtedly a patron of those pigsties. However, that old Western-style suit that maintains the special life of our gentry class always receives unusual attention from the cohabitants. This contains two meanings. One is jealousy, which makes me extremely ashamed. Although in this big city, a person's weight is distinguished by the high or low of their clothes, a group living in a pigsty is like being naked in a bathhouse, with everyone showing their parents' pure bodies, regardless of status. The other—to put it a bit too much—perhaps is greed? In fact, it also comes from envy and jealousy. Human beings are inherently endowed with an upward-striving heart. An old joke once told us that a beggar hoped to become an emperor. The only difference is that some climb upward step by step, while others want to ascend to heaven in one step. Those in the pigsty group naturally belong to the latter category. In that case, the gentry class in their ideals is worthy of being envied and then coveted. However, what makes me uneasy day and night is in these two gazes. On the one hand, I have been squeezed into the noble class. On the other hand, I have fantasized that perhaps something unfavorable will happen. As a result, it is indeed nervous oversensitivity, and the desire to move is becoming increasingly urgent.</p>
<p>I started asking friends for help, because it is too unlikely to find a new hope for my ideal safe haven from "rental advertisements." Fellow members of the gentry class might be able to help. Half a month ago, I moved into such a satisfactory new home. The new residence is a large house, in short, it is above all ordinary Shikumen houses, and is directly rented from the main landlord. The rental price, with one less middleman's profit, does not make me suffer too much. It is a spacious wing room, facing south, with sunlight and air all in excellent condition. In addition, the careful security of the doors and all the telephone equipment make me feel that I have climbed up a level.</p>
<p>However, unfavorable things did happen in the new residence. One morning, when I was about to get dressed, I found that my glasses, cards, and all sorts of trivial notes had been moved from my pockets to the hat rack beside the clothes rack. The newest of my three Western-style suits had disappeared without a trace.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>After this news spread, the cohabitants said in unison: "Nothing has been stolen here for decades!" I have full trust in these words. The friend of the introducer mentioned this when he recommended the new residence. But the sudden theft on that day after decades seems to be related to my destiny.</p>
<p>The losses totaled a new Western-style suit, a Parker fountain pen, and four or five yuan in cash. He carefully placed my most important nearsighted glasses and an insurance policy on the hat rack. If I were to replace them all at once now, it would cost as much as sixty yuan.</p>
<p>At that time, there was a lot of discussion and surprise about this first-time theft. Fortunately, I didn't want to investigate, otherwise I would inevitably reveal my own sourness. Moreover, many people who had nothing to do with me were uneasy all day long. At this point, I couldn't help but look at fate with disbelief. I initially wanted to jump out of the pigsty group. First, I was ashamed of being seen as part of the noble class. Second, I was afraid that poorer people would have the idea of turning me into a pauper. I harbored a despicable heart first, and this theft seems to be self-inflicted. Or perhaps it is retribution. What more can I say?</p>
<h3 id="e240">The Chauffeur <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Jingfu</p>
<p>The vast twilight slowly enveloped everything. In the quiet and elegant garden, the flowers and trees gently and serenely swayed. The tall and graceful Western-style building surrounded by flowers and trees quietly sank into silence, surrounded by an atmosphere of sweet warmth. But Ah Fu, the chauffeur of that brand-new black car in the country, had just watched his masters, that gathering of husband, wife, and children, with their tender words and smiles, and intimate holding of hands, get out of the car and walk with light steps, like happy little birds, flashing into the house to spend that festive night. For a long time, he stood there in a daze. His sore and weak hands silently gripped the steering wheel. His sunken gaze was filled with endless sorrow and melancholy.</p>
<p>The cool breeze of the summer evening gently rose, brushing past the lightly swaying flowers and trees, and blowing against his chest. He couldn't help but feel his heart tremble and beat wildly. The gentle and cool breeze is most sweet and comfortable for those happy people, but for Ah Fu, it only stirred up his mood.</p>
<p>The happy shadows of the masters floated up, and immediately reflected the desolate image of his own house, the thin, haggard, and worried face of his wife, making his heart feel as if it were pressed by a heavy stone, and his mind was stabbed by even more things—rent, food money, creditors for small debts, and so on. Moreover, tonight is supposed to be a happy festive occasion! People are all going home to celebrate, leaving behind a wife who is lonely and cold, and who might be complaining and crying, leaving behind his own heart, which is so painful and anxious.</p>
<p>"Why don't they ever pay you your salary? One month, two months, three months! Why are you so muddle-headed? Those rich people, do they really lack those few coins of yours? Think for yourself, and let us, mother and son, starve... Alas, are you dead?... Why don't you ask them for it?... Hmph, afraid you'll take it to the brothel!" And his wife's heartless voice, filled with crying and scolding, whipped at his heart, making him even angrier! God knows, how could those rich people be short a few coins from their chauffeur's salary? It's been three months since they paid. His wife even complains, thinking that he took the money to visit prostitutes! When Ah Fu thought of these things, the hand gripping the steering wheel kept pressing against his chest, as if his chest were about to burst open.</p>
<p>"How could they lack those few coins?" This also made him think of the situation today when he went to the big hospital to pick up the young master. The young master was skipping school, saying that his throat was a little uncomfortable. Only then did he know! He didn't know how he was treated, but after staying in the hospital for five days, the master handed over a check for one thousand yuan. The two dogs of the mistress, one medical treatment cost seventy or eighty yuan. Ah Fu's three months of hard work were not worth that much! And they haven't paid him a single penny. Today, he mustered up his courage, and when the master returned the seventy-five yuan veterinary fee, he boldly opened his mouth, but the master looked at him a little unhappily: "I don't have any change, ask the mistress, I don't care about these trivial things!" He endured this nail and swallowed it. In the afternoon, he waited for a long time and couldn't find an opportunity to talk to the mistress. Until the guests left, the mistress was busy with her own evening dress and organizing clothes for the young master, instructing the nanny to do this and that. Ah Fu secretly went in and said softly to the mistress: "Mistress, lend me a few..." The mistress didn't wait for him to finish speaking and turned her head to shout at him: "What?" It stunned him! Then he stammered: "Please, mistress, lend me some money." The mistress seemed very annoyed. "Tomorrow!"</p>
<p>Another tomorrow, forcing him to retreat, still falling into the burning and frantic chaos. The joyful festive scene in the Western-style building only made him more uneasy...</p>

<h3 id="e242">The Struggle of Pilsudski (Part 1) <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Nan</p>
<p>The death of Polish national hero General Józef Piłsudski aroused worldwide condolences. The General's great personality and his spirit of hard struggle for the nation and people are indeed worthy of human admiration. At 10:30 a.m. on the 3rd of this month, Nanjing Central University specially invited Mr. Władysław Mazurkiewicz, the Polish Minister to China, to speak about the life of General Piłsudski during the Prime Minister's Memorial Week. Mr. Mazurkiewicz has the attitude of a scholar and has many exchanges with the academic community in our country. The friendship between China and Poland is built on culture and scholarship, so it becomes more and more intimate. This, of course, must be attributed to the efforts of Minister Mazurkiewicz. Now, the main points of Minister Mazurkiewicz's speech are recorded, because our country's current environment needs all citizens to struggle and strive for freedom and revival. General Piłsudski's life is our best model. The main points of the Polish envoy's speech are: I feel that this coincidence is a rare opportunity to give a speech during Dr. Sun Yat-Sen's Memorial Week, because these two great men in the East and West have extremely similar points in their life, achievements, success, and doctrine. Both sacrificed their lives for their country, and both started to struggle to transform their country from a young age, making continuous efforts. At the same time, both were loved by the people of their countries to the highest degree. General Józef Piłsudski was the transformer of Poland and the teacher of the entire Polish nation. What I am talking about today is a condensed picture of the General's lifelong struggle, his endless difficulties, and countless obstacles, which ultimately created the General of today.</p>
<p>The childhood environment has the greatest impact on the success of people's life careers. When the General was young, he witnessed Poland suffering all kinds of tragic oppression from foreign tribes, and even could not freely speak the Polish national language. The General's father was even a sincere patriotic man, who participated in the 1863 revolutionary independence movement several years before the General was born. Therefore, his family was filled with the highest and most loyal patriotic spirit. The General was fully influenced and built a very solid foundation for future success. When the General first entered elementary school, the school forced them to speak Russian and did not allow them to use Polish. In the years he spent in school, he planted the seedling of the General's restoration of the ancestral homeland. When he grew up and entered university, he secretly organized political groups with a small number of Polish classmates and began to actually resist Imperial Russia, the oppressor of Poland. The General's patriotism was so eager that he did not consider the difficulties and dangers of the future at first. Before long, the General was finally expelled from the university for being anti-Russian. This was the first difficulty the General encountered, but the General's spirit was not discouraged. He still worked hard for freedom and actively advanced on the most difficult road, urgently returning to his hometown of Vilnius to gather young comrades and give them ideological training, and actively carrying out revolutionary work. He was even more hated by the Russian government. Soon he was arrested and sentenced to five years of imprisonment, exiled to Siberia. The Tsarist Russia ruled Poland for one hundred and twenty-five years, and thousands of Polish patriots were exiled to Siberia one after another. At that time, the General was only a young man in his twenties.</p>

<p>For the purpose of rewarding customers, Yong An Tang (永安堂) is now giving away exquisite round fans. Anyone who accumulates three pieces of the skin paper from the packaging of the "Bagua Dan (八卦丹)" or "Wan Jin You (萬金油)" products can exchange them for one fan. If the words "Rose Fan (玫瑰團)" are marked on the skin paper, one piece can be exchanged for one fan. If the "Rose Fan" is directly sent, a special messenger will deliver it to your home, free of charge.</p>
<p>The World Peace Association, for the purpose of promoting peace efforts, broadcasts peace issues every Wednesday from 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM at the shipping radio station, lectured by the Secretary-General Sun Xiangzhong (孫翔仲). His lectures are concise and insightful, deeply appreciated by the audience. Mr. Sun went to Pingjin (平晋) last month to visit Mr. Duan Zhengyuan (段正元), resulting in the interruption of the broadcast. Recently, the association received letters from various circles at home and abroad, requesting Mr. Sun to continue his broadcasts. The association, considering the importance of its mission for peace, could not refuse and resumed broadcasting yesterday. The topic of his lecture was "The Dividing Line Between Harming the Country and Saving the Country (禍國與救國之分界綫)." He will provide a detailed explanation of the dividing line between political, military, and other proposals for promoting new culture and old morality, which aim to save the country but may mistakenly harm the country.</p>

<h3 id="e246">"The Old Dark House" Screening <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>"Zombies" and "vampires" are at least phenomena unacceptable in the scientifically advanced 20th century, but there are many exceptions in the universe. We must use reason to observe, explore, and experiment with these metaphysical forces. At the same time, we can also draw conclusions about whether "zombies" can absorb human essence and how to eliminate this harm. "The Old Dark House (古屋奇案)," now showing in Nanjing (南京), is a unique masterpiece by MGM, breaking all horror film records on the screen. It is the most successful and greatest supernatural creation of director Tod Browning, who once directed the banned film "Dracula (殭屍)," and lead actor Bela Lugosi. The original author is Guy Endore, who wrote "The Werewolf of Paris (巴黎人狼)," a book that caused a great stir in the philosophical and literary circles. In addition to Lugosi, the actors include Lionel Barrymore, Elizabeth Allan, Melvyn Douglas, and Raymond Hatton, all of whom are prominent stars. Especially Carroll Borland, who plays the female vampire Luna, has a sinister and terrifying appearance. The background lighting and atmosphere are chilling. The cinematographer is Huang Zongzhan, the only Chinese technician in Hollywood, and the film is accompanied by the latest masterpiece "Fra Diavolo (詐死)" by the comedic duo Laurel and Hardy. The picture on the left is a scene from the film.</p>
<h3 id="e247">"Forgotten Faces" Soon to be Released <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>Columbia's new film "Forgotten Faces (慾海遺恨)" is a significant creation in the world of cinema. With the theme of urban diseases, it writes about the dangers of sexual life, giving a profound stimulus to urban youth, pointing out the lost path on one hand, and exposing the pathological conditions and revealing the location of the disease without omission, truly a compassionate and meritorious work for the world and people's hearts, and will be released soon at the New Kwong Ta Theatre (新光大戲院).</p>
<h3 id="e248">News Regarding the Performance of "A Doll's House" <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>Nora's Great Fortune</p>
<p>This year can be said to be the year of "Nora (娜拉)". There have been more than six thousand records of the play being performed in various places. Many famous figures in the drama and film circles have also decided to perform this script. It is said that they have been secretly rehearsing for more than two months and will premiere it at the Jin Cheng Theatre (金城) at the end of this month.</p>
<p>The Actors of "Nora"</p>
<p>Speaking of the actors of "Nora", they are all well-known figures. Zhao Dan (趙丹), Jin Shan (金山), and Wei Heling (魏鶴齡) are all figures in the drama and film circles most welcomed by the audience. Ms. Lan Ping (藍蘋), who plays the role of Nora, is a star in the Peking drama circle. She recently came south to join Dian Tong (電通). Although she is extremely busy filming, she still works hard to rehearse "Nora" every day. Ms. Wu Mei (吳湄), who plays the role of Lin Dun (林敦), is a veteran on the Shanghai stage. Ms. Han Mansong (韓曼松), who plays the role of Anna (阿納), is an unparalleled old female impersonator. Even the role of Irene (愛蘭) is played by Ms. Wu Ling (吳玲), the main actress of "Zhi Kuang (旨狂)". It can be seen how careful the selection of the actors for this "Nora" is.</p>
<p>Stage Personnel Engaged in Archaeology</p>
<p>For this performance, the stage set and lighting costumes are all in the style of the 19th century. For the sake of caution, many stage workers and costume designers have buried themselves in archaeology. It is said that this time, costumes alone have cost more than two hundred yuan.</p>
