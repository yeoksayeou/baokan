<p>時評</p>
<h3>輿論之意義</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>平津衛戍司令朱哲元於就職後接見新聞記者時。發表感想四點。中有一點。則爲希望輿論界予以不客氣之批評。旨哉斯言。一何恢恢有君　之度乎。年來士氣頹茶。輿論銷沉。寒蟬仗馬之譏。常覺有忝面目。固由環境複雜。言事匪易。而吾新聞界之未靖厥職。亦誠有難自諉過者。宋氏此一語。固不啻予吾人以嚴重之鞭策也。</p>
<p>輿論界之責任。原在以民間之喉舌。謀上下之棣通。處今日錯綜之局面。遭社會邪惡之氣候。一切行政設施。均感不易着手。自非睿賢大聖。寗能措置咸宜。耳目未周。得失不彰。雖智者之千慮。亦難免乎一失。匡梂維護之道。端在藉輿論之指陳。爲懲毖之運行。積極方面得收集思廣益之效。消極方面可免壅　隔閡之弊。增團結之效能。輔在位之不逮。輿論界批評之意義。如是而已。</p>
<p>批評之動機。有出於善意者。有出於惡意者。尋疵摘。尤無關宏恉。此惡意之說也。就事論　。敷陳得失。此善意之說也。而在善意批評之中。或出以委婉之態度。或純取排觝之手段。惡意之攻訐。固爲軼出輿論之範圍。嚴切之諍言。亦常難邀受者之諒解。唯誠篤平允之貢獻。宜最易促當事之反省。顧國人通病。每多樂諛惡直。師心自用。認識不淸。一聞批判。卽生嗔今。非謂於我有嗛。即曰別具用心。矜持意氣。罔顧事實。雖有臧謀。忍與距逆。不悟批評足資借鏡。功用正同藥石。雖於味爲澀。而疾痰自蠲。昔禹聞善言則拜。大舜樂取樂人。與其認爲仁人之用心。毌寗視作賢者之手段。蓋必廣釆博咨。方能自躋閎。反之執褊狹之成見。强萬喙以從同。匪直示人以隘。亦複礙及進展。今宋氏公開表示樂聞批評。且願聞不客氣之批評。其注視輿論之殷切。正以見其自爲打算之精密。吾新聞界於汗顏承受之餘。又　可不思盡最大之努力以自祓濯乎。</p>

<h3>英意互相保証　海軍活動無敵意</h3>
<p>歐洲緊張局勢轉和緩　意相提最低要求四項　為解决東菲問題條件</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國已設法緩和英意兩國之緊張局勢、外部今日發表聲明、謂英國並無攻擊意國之意、且詳述英國駐意大使德魯蒙與意國外交次長蘇維克在羅馬談話互相保證之情形、謂德魯蒙大使曾言英國艦隊之調動及增援地中海之守衛侮「意國報紙最近猛烈攻訐英國、因而發生之自然結果」云、此間深信外部此項聲明、係欲使意相墨索里尼因之或可易於採取較爲妥協之態度、至於日內瓦方面、則墨氏之要求離似來勢洶洶、然旣有放棄戰爭最低限度之條件提出、空氣亦頓呈樂觀、按墨氏所提之條件計有下列三端、（一）意屬愛立德里及索馬里必須取得土地上之聯絡、由阿比西尼亞割讓西部一區歸意、（二）阿比西尼亞任何通海之道路、必須經過意國屬地之海口、（三）阿比西尼亞大部份之軍隊必須遣散、並解除武裝、其餘軍隊則須歸意國將領統制、據悉國聯代表現在惟英國之馬首是瞻、多數人皆不信英國能允許擴大五國委員會建議之範圍、並預料國聯本身亦不能接受此等條件、因接受之後、卽無異侵犯阿比西尼亞之主義也、（二十二日國民社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國各晨報對於意政府公報載拒絕五人特委會建議者之措詞、及其批評解决辦法之言論、認爲乃時局轉佳之象、據每日電聞云、意相墨索里尼最低要求包括下列四項、（一）割讓意國之土地、須視建議者爲多，（二）阿國通海之出路、必須經過伊里特里，（三）阿國陸軍必須解除武裝、而由意國改編之，（四）須以充分十地割讓意國、使伊里特里得與意屬索瑪里倫相啣接、每日電聞主張取忍耐政策以對意、謂國聯行政院與大會採取之堅强態度、已在羅馬發生顯然有力之印象、而英海軍集中於地中海、使此印象愈臻深刻云、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）自英國集中海軍於地中海後、英意關係緊張已極、然自英國聲明其海軍動作與制裁無關之後、此間人心爲之一舒、因是意阿衝突足以引起歐洲戰事之惶懼心理、亦無形消釋、同時英法意間之外交談判已復行繼續進行、假使國聯無法解决時局難關、此間希望英法意另開三國會議、屆時墨索里尼或當親自出席、各報對英態度、現皆趨於和緩、對於五國委員之建議、亦較能爲客觀之批評、（廿三日國民電）</p>
<h3>接獲意阿覆文　特委會昨集議</h3>
<p>承認調解已吿失敗　草擬報吿提交政院</p>
<p>（日內瓦）五國委員會今晨開會、决於明日續議、以便對國聯行政院草擬委員會調解失敗之報吿、據政界消息、意代表阿樂西送交委員會之墨索里尼覆文、委員會認爲不能接受、據墨氏要求、（一）由阿國割一地帶、俾意屬爰立特利與索謀里得以聯絡、同時更割阿京東部地若干與意（二）爲酬償阿國之割地計、由意大利於意屬殖民地中給以海口、（三）阿國完命解除武裝、（四）爲維持治安所必要之警察、須受意國支配、（二十三日國民電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）意國堅决要求必以毘連伊里特里之土地割與意國、並許意國對於阿國本部有一種管轄權、故意阿爭議現漸趨近破裂之點、衆認時局幾已無望、並料意國有退出國聯之可能、此間人士現抱悲觀、恐意阿觀念點永不能融洽、意國反對五人特禾會提議之態度、依然未變、據今日消息、阿國已接受五人特委會之提議、惟須保全其主權、詳則尚須討論、法總理賴伐爾今晨由巴黎抵此、卽與意代表阿洛錫特委會主席瑪達亞迦晤談、午前十一時舉行五人特委會會議、聞阿洛錫向之提出意國正式答覆特委會提議之文、會議時間極短僅數分鐘、後發出公佈、據謂五人特委會今晨集議、紀錄阿國依允本會建議之覆文、並研究附載意見之意國覆文、特委會决定向國聯行政院報吿從公文等而可顯見之一般局勢云、主席瑪達里亞迦午後將與意阿雙方代表會唔、明日再舉行特委會會議、以草擬致國聯行政院之報吿書、陳述調解失敗之經過情形、聞明日會議時特委會將研究國聯盟約第十五條之條文、俾作國聯此後行動之根據、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯會秘書處頃發表公報稱、意阿爭端小組委員會、頃於今晨舉行會議、當就阿比西尼亞接受該委員會建議案之復文、曁意國政府之答案加以討論、幷議决向行政院提出報吿書、用以說明時局情形云、一般人以爲該委員會因意阿兩國復文均已遞到、幷因現行爭端所牽涉之利益極其重要、實有請示行政院之必要、愛乃决定向行政院提出報告書、法國總理賴伐爾業於該委員會開會之前、與意國總代表阿洛錫相會晤、同時英國不管部閣員艾登、亦與該委員會主席瑪達里亞伽有所商談（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯會行政院意阿爭端小組委員會、定於明日舉行會議、並擬定報吿書送達行政院、此項報吿書當包括該委員會成立以來、所作各項談判一切關係文件、一般人預料行政院當於明日午後或後日舉行會議、討論此項報吿書、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）觀察家相信意阿兩國答復小組委員會之後、意阿爭端局勢業已臻於絕頂、緣阿國政府對於該委員會所提出之和平解决計畫旣已表示接受、則意國在法理上卽當遵守國聯會盟約第十五條第六項之約束、而不得向該國任意宣戰、但以意相墨索里尼昨日所提出各項要求而論、殆將阿國割歸意國管理、旣非國聯會所能接受、而在英國代表團方面、則以爲小組委員會所提出之建議、當認爲最大限度、决無再進一步之可能、蓋以此項建議案、對於意國所提要求、可謂已經滿足、該委員會主張改組阿國經濟機構卽所以符合意國願望也、加之此項建議若果提出行政院向之請示辦理、則行政院碍於本身資格、未必定能贊同、因而意國所可獲取者、當在小組委員會建議案之下矣云、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>意負責發言人稱　和解之門未閉　靜待國聯新提議</h3>
<p>（羅馬）負責發言人今日對路透訪員種、和解意阿爭議之門、現仍開放、意國刻待國聯方向之新提議、五人特委會近提議中所未載之最低的討論基礎、或可於新提議中見之、意國並未提出答案云、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）據此間聲稱、意國目前不致退出國聯、必俟被迫不得不退出時始擬出此、意國之態度、縱不和諧、而殊屬正當云、按此間報紙近來未倡意國當退出國聯之說、此節殊可注意也、（一十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）外國觀察家以爲意國人民對於意阿爭端、現正靜待國際局勢發展而安度其日常生活、此間幷無大戰前夕氣象、各報評論國聯會行政院小組委員會之建議案、類皆以爲該委員會雖已承認阿國機構、實有改組之必要、但所提計畫，僅以改組行政機構爲限、抑知改組行政苟無堅固之基礎、質言之、苟非將阿國全國澈底加以改造、殊鮮成功之望歟云云、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英反對意用兵東菲之內幕</h3>
<p>通遠東航路視為生命綫　非為弱小國家扶持正義</p>
<p>（紐約）據此間有力方面之意見、英國反對意相墨索里尼對阿比西尼亞用兵、其內幕實在非爲此菲洲之蕞爾小邦、保障正義、世人皆視歐洲於十年內當不致發生戰爭、然目前形勢己　然改變、英人以爲意國此次對阿之行動、係一種殖民政策之先鋒、倘能成功則菲洲全部殖民地之地位皆將受意國之威脅英國在地中海·菲洲及紅海之覇權如爲他人所奪則英帝國之基礎卽將搖動、因由直布羅陀海峽經及彝士運河·紅海·以達印度·遠東澳洲·紐西蘭之航路、實為英國商業之生命綫也、英國人民固反對戰爭、然保衛其帝國則爲另一問題、故英皇在此等時期、亦即可由被動之地位、一變而成爲效忠國家千萬十民之領袖、倘內閣一旦議决戰爭爲不可避避、英皇雖愛好和平、亦必贊成其决議、而全國人民將競起爲英皇之後盾、且如英意開戰、他國亦將捲入漩渦、蓋英法二國爲天然之友邦、且向來共同擁護國聯、法國在大陸上亦甚多聯　、一方面意國亦並不孤立也、（廿二日國民電）</p>
<h3>英意海軍　地中海佈防</h3>
<p>彼此保證不含侵略　英使訪晤墨索里尼</p>
<p>（倫敦）英意兩國政府已彼此保證其海軍在地中海之活動、並無侵略目的、據英外交部發表正式文告稱、九月二十日駐羅馬英大使德魯蒙爵士謁見意外次蘇維志、以英政府之名義、將地中海英艦隊之行動及增厚戍軍與戰品事告知之、並聲明英國此種舉措、並不含有侵略之意志、僅爲意國報章近數星期來作反英運動、故英國不得不取此戒備計畫、蘇維志答稱、渠奉命宣布意國在地中海所作之軍事準備、純爲戒防性質、非志在侵略云、聞德魯蒙爵士此次通知意政府、並非因羅馬方面有何正式抗議而出此、實由於英政府之自動、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英外部發表上項公報目的、在於消滅時局之緊張性、或且用以表示英意兩國間之衝突、實不成問題、關於此層、官方曾再三表示、英國海軍防範措置、其目的有二、一則使英國有所準備、俾國聯行政院一旦决定後、英國可實施國聯盟約之規定、二則遇發生緊急事變時、足以保護英國自身之利益、但不論環境如何變化、英國必須視國聯行政院之决議以爲轉移、至關於昨日意大利內閣發表之公報、則官方人士並未加以評論、僅謂至目前爲止、日內瓦方面談判仍有繼續進行之望云、總之官方意見對於時局尚抱樂觀、且相信今夜外交部發表之公報、當可使前途益趨順利云、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國駐意大使德魯蒙爵士頃奉政府訓令、晋謁音國首相兼外長墨索里尼舉行談話、此舉對於目前事變發展、有極重要之影響、蓋自最近爭端發生以來、駐意大使德魯蒙始終僅與意國外次蘇維區接洽一切、今與　相墨索里尼晤對一堂、則意國對阿比西尼亞是否有在政治方面覓求妥協之可能、英意兩國間之緊張關係、是否可設法緩和、不難就兩人談話而覷知矣、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>直布羅陀港　英國軍隊運送艦「那伐沙號」、由沙善墩裝運步兵一千六百名、於本日午後駛抵此間、明日復將裝運軍火駛往瑪爾秦島、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （朱慰萱）</p>
<p>一件簇新的衣服上，忽然染了一槐汚點，固然有失美觀，使人增恨，但是衣服上的污點，可以設法消除，就是不能，至多也不過犧牲一件衣服。只有人格上的污點：才是終身的缺陷，永久的穢跡，但是現社曾的人們，往往忽視人格上的污點，而反斤斤於衣服—的穢跡</p>
<p>在大都　的電車中，往往見一般西裝革履的少年，　坐　摩登）婦女。據說：這是因爲婦女體質　弱，不勝站　之勞，所以讓平是權禮貎的靑年應有的　動；但是我想這般懂禮貌的靑年，假使任游山的時候，見到一般拾轎上山的女與夫，不知作何　想？說不定自已坐五橋裏，還儘是說伊們足力不，走得不快哩！</p>
<p>一個人死了之後，假使眞容亭裏所掛的遺容，與本人身前的面貎稍有像，馬上會給人發　而絲毫不能掩飾；　是眞容亭旁邊所掛歌功頌德的輓聯，和自己訃開上大坎，擂的哀啟行述，雖與本人身前　實完　不　，却絕對不會有人指摘非　。這眞是一個絕大的疑問？</p>
<h3>惠山泥塑</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>無錫來的朋友，送給？惠山出產的泥人二件，一是鬈髮時裝的少女，一是乳凸臂的祼婦。愧我不是藝術家，沒　去賞鑒，祇好分給家裏兩個小孩去玩要。</p>
<p>講到錫山的泥人，在小工藝中也有悠久的歷史；而且也是遐邇馳名。記得在我小的時候，和鄰里小朋友「齋模佛」時，便是玩的這一種。有肥頭胖耳，頭梳　髻，大腹便便的大阿福；也有白面長鬚，身穿紅袍的文昌；更有一手持鞭，金面跨虎的趙玄壇。這些都是惠山的出產，我們小孩子當它拱璧般珍愛。現下時代是進步了，上邊所說的幾種祇供鄕下小孩子玩玩，而目下所塑的，也以模特兒，小孩子，時裝少女爲多；更有劉關張結義，福祿壽三星等。屬於戲劇方面的，如狸貓換太子，　蜡廟，白水灘等。還有是京角的戲臉，生旦凈丑，一應俱全；不過祗有頭臉而沒有身幹，祗供幾位戲迷們玩賞。</p>
<p>一件泥人的塑就，也有幾番手脚：先搗泥，二製胚，三着色，四上油，在惠山底下靠它生活的人，也有好幾百家咧！不過我希望他們更要改良，仿西洋的石膏像方法，塑成一切人物。色彩不要花花綠綠，務求高雅大方；姿態也要生動活潑，不要流入俚俗呆板，那末不憂不在藝術界中佔一席地咧！</p>
<h3>變態</h3>
<p>— 大木</p>
<p>老祠變了，動不動他就氣憤憤地說：「我從今不要朋友，朋友欺騙我够了，我的精神亦痛苦得够了，還是讓我孤獨吧。」他把房間從唐家弄搬到太陽廟去居住子，他不給人家信，人家寄他的信也不復。他在一家大旅館裏當　　，一天至夜有許多多花枝招展的女人打他眼前經過，他總是在喉嚨口肢咕着：『女人，靠不住的女人呵，你不是跟着洋錢跑，便是戀着小白臉，我老柯，唉，我老柯受盡了你們的……』</p>
<p>老柯年紀還不滿二十八歲，看去可像四十相近的人了，他從小就沒家沒道的飽經了世途風塵，天生一般豪爽好友的脾氣，滿腮短鬍子，具有「胡大海」的風格，但他會做瀟洒的香　詩，他常當隱隱向朋表示缺乏異性的安慰。後來由朋友的介紹亦認識了幾個女友！女職“，女詩人，女學生，歌唱明星……</p>
<p>然而，他都被中途奚落了，女友有些和他的男友跑在一塊了。於是，他駡盡他所有的朋友：「你們在精神上欺騙了我，你們騙走我的靈魂和忠實！」過去，他嘗爲女友而戒過酒，戒過烟，停做過詩……他做過一時期順從的隨役。現在，他粉紅色的夢醒了，老是獨個子躱在房間裏喝酒，喝酒……罵……</p>
<p>「老柯變了，發神經病了。」朋友都淡然地互相傳告。</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十九回　大員惜羽毛敲門有術新歡離骨肉探病無由</p>
<p>介夫一看他這情形，料着比藍專實還要急，這就笑道：那麽，我就去罷。談着，就向賈多才這邊走這時眞够受窘的，看那裘書記忠於主人翁之事，老在　上向人看着，不容退後，於是慢慢走到賈多才房門邊　，却看到他那屋子裏，燈光小得像豆子大，隔了昏黑的紙窗，最易看到這點火光。賈多才沒什麽聲息，却聽現那月英小姑娘，又在息率率的哭。這眞不好辦，叫起賈先生在這時說話，他第一不高興。而月英還在哭，若要隔窗說話，更怕人家說是探秘密來了。躊躇了一會子，再看樓上，料着則誠在高的亮處，看不到這黑的低處。於是踅到墻角邊，自言自語的，故意學着賈多才的口音，低聲道：旣是你來如這樣說了，我看你的面子，不計較了。隨着又用本音低聲道：多謝多謝，將來我請你吃飯。說畢，咕嚕了一陣，又大聲道：好！我們一言爲定了。這才離開墻角，故意經過樓梯下，又到周有容屋子那邊去。他的屋子，在一個小跨院裏，則誠雖是站東樓上，也看不到的。這就大方的多了，站在那小路院中間，向天空裏看了一回星斗，佔量着，也就有十分八分鐘了，才回身向院外走來。則誠似平把這事看得十分重要，他依然還在樓欄干邊站着。介夫忽然心裏一動，便有了妙計，放開脚步，一陣快走，跑上樓梯。（三二三）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>除了丹鳳朝陽以外，其他比較名貴些的菊花還有白龍鬚，紫金鈴，雪球，雨過天靑，好幾十種，一　也不及列與：　使　出來也沒甚興味，這裏便决意一概從略了。</p>
<p>太后的愛好花卉是很有利學家的風度的，伊决不僅以觀賞爲已盡愛好之能事：伊對於無論那一種花，都想充分的利用它們。譬如把各種鮮花採去給那些做繡作的女工當標本，把玫瑰花鳳仙花的液汁製成化裝用品等，都</p>
<p>很有意義的。那末太后對於菊花又是怎樣的利用呢？這個伊是用　當做食品的食法如下：</p>
<p>先把那一種名喚雪球的白菊花採下一二朶來，大槪是因爲雪球的花瓣短而密，又且非常潔淨，所以特別的宜於煮食；每次總是隨採隨吃的。採下之後，就把花瓣一起摘下，揀出那些焦黃的或沾有汚垢的幾瓣一起丟掉，再將留下的浸在溫水內漂洗上一二十分鐘，然後取出，再放在已溶有稀礬的溫水內漂洗，末了便把它們撈起，安在竹籃裏歷淨，這樣就算是端整好了。第二步當然便是煮食的開始了。太后每逢要嘗試這種特殊的食品之前，總是十分的興奮，像一個鄕下人快要去赴席的情形一樣。（四二三）</p>
<p>世界珍聞</p>
<h3>英國的刺花術</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>英京倫敦，有一位名滿歐洲的刺花專家，名白吉德，chtltBur他的事務所是在一條北蘭倍十街中，其門如市，每天前去請他刺花的人，終繹不絕，有靑年，有　人，但是好人，　富家翁，有美女郎，以至水手，商人，和鷄嗚狗盜之流，都去請他在他們的身上刺花或刺字，以留永久的紀念。凡是花或宇，經刺上之後，就永遠麼滅不去，倘要另換花樣，祇得設法在舊的花樣上，蓋上新的花樣，若是一定要除去它，那就需要很多的時間和很大的功夫，而那筆手續費也很可觀的了。</p>
<p>大凡在戀愛中的靑年，往往跑上白吉德的門去，請他在胸口或背上，刺上一個小愛神或兩顆心，更在旁邊刺着他的愛人的芳名，甚麽瑪麗哩，瓊痕哩，安那哩，不一而足。一般年少現美的女子，也很歡喜這刺花的玩意兒，曾有位二十歲左右的美女郎，因爲愛上了一個靑年白特，特地請白吉　在伊雪白的玉背上，刺了「我愛白特」幾個字，欣然的去了。過了一體拜，伊忽又氣噓噓地趕來找白吉德，說是白特惱了伊，他如今要把背上所刺的字除去了。白吉德勸伊耐心克等幾天，也許會恢復以前的情感，免得多費這一番手續。可是那文郎的態度非常堅决，非除去不可。白吉德沒奈何，足足費了兩星期的工天，用一隻電針和一種特製的藥水，細細的塗擦，纔磨去了。</p>
<p>白吉德對於這種磨去舊時的字樣或花樣的工作，視爲畏途，所以他有時總勸人家將字樣改成一束花朵，一個鮮果，一秤菜蔬，或一串長春藤的葉子，仗着他的技巧，能把那些字樣遮蓋得一些兒看不出來。這種工作，雖覺麻煩，然而比了全部磨去，却容易得多了。</p>
<p>據白吉德對一位倫敦某週刊的訊者說：「我做這刺花的工作，巳有三十五年之久，而最奇怪的經歷是：有一天，有一位中年男子，趕到我的店中來，要求我將他的全部遺囑給他刺在背上。從前名小小說家哈葛作先生作小說一玉雪留痕」，記一位女郎在肩背上刺遺囑，我以爲這是寓言八九，未必是實在的事。不道如今竟有人跑上我的門來，請我刺遺囑了。這一回的工作，費了我兩點半鐘的工夫，因爲字數是很多的。這遺囑中包含着一筆很大的資產，預備將來分給好幾個人。他的所以要刺在背上，因爲一則不會遺失，一二則在他死後，別人不能更改之故一。</p>
<p>據白吉們說：「薩摩亞島向有刺花的習慣，他們每生個孩子，總得在他們的　上刺上生日和姓名，任是到死也不會磨滅的。以後倘要知道他是什麽人，只須一看他身上就知道了。有一位國際間很有名的銀行家，要到印度幾處分行中去視察一切，他在肘子上面的腎上，刺上了他的名字，並指導他的屬員的詳細方略。要是有一位遠地的分行中人懷疑他的來歷，那麽他只須捲扣襯衫的袖；便可證明他確是他們的領袖了</p>
<p>白吉德又說，戀愛與戰爭，是刺花的兩個原動力。所以在戀愛中的男女，往往要在身上刺着愛人的名字，或紀念愛人的圖畫；而在歐洲大戰以後，受傷歸來的軍人，不知有多少，他們爲了要掩蓋那些傷痕起見，就紛紛的來請白吉德刺上一朶花或幾個字。因此白吉德的營業，異常發達，</p>
<p>白吉德補相的手段確是很高明的，曾有一個婦女，因面頰上生了外症，由外科醫生給伊開刀療治，然後將傷口縫合起來。但是那一綫痕迹，仍然是隱隱可見。那婦人玉一般的美頰上，有了這白圭之玷，以爲是生平莫大的憾事。有一天，伊便來訪問白吉德，請他設法彌補，不惜里酬。白吉德施展他神奇的手術，居然彌補得十分完美，有如天衣無縫，使那婦人歡喜讚嘆而去。</p>
<p>白吉德也是一個美容專家，他的夫人就給他做了一個極大的廣吿。伊在二十年前，曾由他在臉上施過一番手術，至今臉泛桃花，嬌滴滴的好似二個十六七歲的姑娘。最初白吉德本來在他夫人的臂上，刺了一些桃紅色的花樣，瞧去分外的嬌艷，給伊一位中年的女友看見了，就要求白吉德在伊的臉上，也刺上這樣一抹桃紅的色彩。白吉德如言做到，使這位女友彷彿恢復了靑春。伊滿意已極，就把他善於華容的令名傳了開去。</p>
<p>白吉德又說：「我的殺有趣的主顧，是位白頭髮的七十老翁，他趕夾瞧我，要我把他的臉上刺上抹桃紅的顏色。據他說：他是要像一個老水手般，顯得健康而有血色。我當然辦到，他老人家也滿意而去。我的最繁重的工作，是有一位澳洲的官員，將出國赴任，要求我在他的背上，刺一幅很繁複的圖畫，這一回，我從上午七時半開始，直到夜半方才完工。我的一件最艱難的工作，是有一個賭徒，剛在賭塲中，贏了一大注錢，很是高興，就來要求我在他的背上，刺上全副的紙牌，以誌紀念。我的一件最得意的工作，是有一位老紳士，來要求我在他光滑的禿頂上，刺上喬治王陛下的肯像，表示他忠君愛國的熱忱」。</p>

<p>從成都到重慶日記　九月十七日早晨、第六届全國運動會四川選手隊一行四十餘人、由總領隊劉愼旃率領、從民本體師前集合乘車出發、選手隊本定九一八日出發、因爲督辦署專車之便、就提前一天、汽車一共是一輛、女選手一輛、其餘職員和里選手分乘二車、雖然很擠、但每個人面上、都泛着笑容、大家都是高高興興的、三輛車、時十餘、浩浩蕩蕩接連着駛出東門、走上成渝大道、天氣很好、田野間樹草、一切都顯着快樂有聲氣、正和我們車上的人一樣、走到龍泉驛山頂、回頭看成都、這一片眞稱得起是沃野千里的盆地、躺在我們眼底、我們嚴肅地有點感動、我們天快黑子、汽車在暮色中疾駛晚風撲面、不時帶來一陣陣桂花的香味、七時餘到球溪河、就寢、全體分住兩家旅館、臨睡前職員和各隊隊長還開了一次會議、檢討出發途中第一天發現的缺點、和以後糾正的辦法、一天顚簸的疲勞、在夜裏都恢復了、第一天的早晨、才五點鏡、大家又爬上了車子、今天車子上却是靜靜的沒有人笑、沒有人多說話、大家的心情都拾九一八這三個字壓住了、我們記起了選手歡呼詞中的兩句、强敵壓境、我們去抵抗、東北失地我們去收復、是的我們無疑的願意做復興民族的戰士、車近內江、天下雨了、我們默默的讓雨淋、不動也不叫喚、第一二輛車先抵內江、第三輛到的時候、他們莊重的站起來聽了一遍選手隊的歡呼詞、然後從容的在兩車跳下車來、早餐就在內江的一家萬安旅館中用餐、依我的意思、不管天雨否吃完飯立即就走、但車夫說一定要等雨停、我們也沒有辦法、只好默默的希望着天晴、十二點鐘雨里然停了、車子又開動、到椑木鎭、渡河到榮昌進午餐、夜宿在永川、十九號一早、我們又離開永川、預計十一點鐘就可到重慶了、兩天來的辛勞、又給望重慶的念頭克服、大家又高興采烈的、</p>

<p>（十四日）對修德俱樂部足球隊、此隊係民生公司航務管理處用康旅行隊之精華、然連絡不佳、加之本隊合作工夫漸人佳境、故戰來頗欠精彩、作一面倒之勢、上下多半時本隊各進六球、而修德隊一無所獲、結果十一對是（）、本隊勝此戰在山立中校球塲舉行、</p>

<h3>小男兒（五五）</h3>
<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄（宗海）譯</p>
<p>有一天星期六的下午當一羣孩子來遊玩的時候，韜摩說道：</p>
<p>「讓我們跑到河邊，截得一些新的釣魚竿回來，」</p>
<p>「要兎披將它們拖回來，我們中間的一個可以騎了他過去，」太胖提議道，他是最怕走路的。</p>
<p>「這就是說你騎得去，我推想；也罷，快來，你這懶骨頭，「唐恩說道，一溜烟他去了，後夾截得了竿子，正要歸來，不幸小橋看見韜摩騎着兎披，手裏拿了一根長竿子，便說道：</p>
<p>「你看去倒像圖畫裏那個鬥牛的大佬，只是你沒有一塊紅巾，也沒有穿着艷麗的衣服，」</p>
<p>「我倒要看見這麼一個；來不麼」？韜摩脫道，同時搜着他的槍矛。</p>
<p>「那末就來一個；老黃花生那大草塲裏，衝過去，韜摩，看她怎樣跑，那慣於弄乖的唐恩提議道。</p>
<p>「不，不可以的，」小僑開始阻止道，他已知道唐恩的提議是不可靠的。</p>
<p>唐恩插入質問道，「為什麼不可以？你這不驚小丫頭，」「我　茀姨丈是不喜歡這個的。」</p>
<p>「他曾否說過我們不可以鬥牛？」</p>
<p>「倒不，我卻沒有聽到過」小橋也承認看。</p>
<p>「那末再不要開口，上去，韜摩，這裏有一塊紅條布好向那東西撲過去，我會帮助你去鼓動她；「唐恩說了，一躍而過那個牆頭，對於那新玩意兒眞是興高采烈，後面跟着一羣孩子，卻像一羣綿羊般的柔順便是小橋也在內，他坐在籬笆上看那遊戲的進行，也覺興味不淺。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>讀史有感</h3>
<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>改讀歷史這一個問題，很早就有人提出，中間還經過轉述，然而現在是冷落了。去年七月號的申報”刋上，徐懋庸先生主張學校應該從頭採用社會進化史作敎本，這意見，是很可注意的。社會進化史一類的書籍，對於現代中國的學生，實在還嫌太隔膜，我們只見「漢武帝雄才大略」，「××之世，比於成廣之治」等類的名句，在中學生的腦袋里打旋子，而對於歷史演變的因果，却反而非常糢糊，這實在不是好現象。</p>
<p>對於歷史，我以爲不但應該改讀，而且還應當改寫。社會進化史一類的書籍，固然是切要的，而漢武帝唐太宗輩的史蹟，實在也應該知道一點。不過過去的史書，可信的實在很少，就說漢晉時代私撰的史書吧，因爲限於見聞，無從廣採博記，那結果，只能畫出一點粗枝大葉米。到了唐朝，太宗以右文」自命，國家設局修史，材料的收集，雖然可以多一點，然而史書旣出官撰，就不免時時要打官話，　可信的成分，也越發少下去了。這時候，大家就只得掏野史。</p>
<p>不過我所以說歷史要改作或重作的原因還不止此。過去的史家，太着重於英雄的雕塑，而忽略了所以塑成這英雄的羣衆的力量，和社會的環境。他們所記的是一朝——其實也正是一家的歷史，而且這一家里，又只寫了幾　他們所認爲重要的脚色。</p>
<p>但事實上，歷史却並不是幾個人的歷史。</p>
<p>所以就必得要改作。所謂改作，當然不是「牛鬼蛇神」的胡亂去竄改，對於史事，是更加要求其眞實，可信的。不過一方面還得用新的方法，重新評價，注進進步的世界觀去。這樣，才能使過去的史實，和眼前的時勢發生相連的關係，而明白了現在的所以成爲現在的前因後果。這才是歷史的最大的意義。</p>
<p>淸朝中葉的時候，學者們對於歷史的改作和補作，是很起勁的。如湯承烈的季漢書，謝啟昆的西魏書，周濟的晉略，陳鱣的續唐書，邵晋涵的宋志，魏源的新元史等，其於舊史多所糾正，而寫法方面，也很有新的嘗試，這毅力，是値得佩服的。</p>
<p>但也還有缺點：他們雖然知道自己以外有紅毛人，然而知畢竟還沒有新的世界觀。</p>
<p>去年以來，著作界開始出現了所謂歷史小品，這自然是可喜的事情。不過寫這種小品的人並不多，寫得好的尤其少。這原因，我想：第一是作者必須有正確的世界觀；第二是要有豐富的歷史知識。前者主灌注，後者主理解，這對於想改寫歷史的人們，是必要的。</p>
<p>可是這樣的人材却根難得。在近世，我只知道一個韋爾斯（H．G．Wells）</p>
<p>然而對於中國，我不但希望他有好的歷史小品，也希望有韋爾斯，有正確的有着新的世界觀的整部史書，無論是改作也好，補作也好，重作也好。——我讀了一部近人編著的歷史書後，心里這樣迫切地想。　九月十六日。</p>
<h3>芙蓉鳥底主人</h3>
<p>— 張一蘋</p>
<p>芙蓉鳥底主人有一個漂亮的稱號叫花花太歲」。他對於這稱號是感到非常滿意和向傲的，雖然當他面前人家總是呌聲「大少爺。</p>
<p>暮春三月，郊外的桃花滿樹飛紅。春天是個旅行的李節，城里人都結隊到四郊去，鄕下有時候亦被城里人稱羨不止的。大少爺近來像生一點小病，他懶得大烟都不想抽，而偏偏自己一個心腹的僕人根福被老太爺」支使當什麼差去了。他終日困居在書房里，對着那頭善侍人意的芙蓉馬玩着。。他撅起了兩爿厚嘴唇學着他叫，高興起來，就划着兩手學做飛翔的樣子，把日子那樣艱難地打發遜去。天早晨，他偶然瞥見院子牆角的一株挑花，放着紅色的花朶，他用斯文的拳頭槌着窗櫺，如果根福在眼前，他早會想出方法來消磨這困懶的春天，郊外的桃花棣應該是遊人如　的時候了。大少爺想着抓過鳥範托在右手的手掌上，頓時踏是了腳步獨自向郊外去了。</p>
<p>但是歸來時候大少爺又像隻吃了敗仗的公鷄一樣，沒頭沒腦躺到烟榻上去，把那上好的土膏儘在火尖上滾着，最後嗤嗤的變成塊然炭。那頭芙蓉鳥却在節里蹦着跳着，把　音呌得更動聽，彷彿吿訴人家在郊外牠碰着一件十分得意的事情。但是牠不是頭八哥，誰都猜不透牠的意思，而會說話的大少爺反閉　鳥嘴，好像和芙蓉鳥相反地惱怒着。他燒够了烟，（沒有上得一口）從烟榻上跳起來，照島籠掛到屋檐下去。這楚他心愛的鳥，否則早已把牠摔了個半死，在大少爺惱怒的時候，是誰都不敢放一個屁的。他無聊耐地在地中央踱着圈子，鼓着腦愛。心里更迫切地想着根福，要是根福在身邊，哼，這件事不致如此棘手的！</p>
<p>有脚步聲停止在書房門口，大少爺唸了聲佛，但是他不立即車轉身來，大聲地問着誰？馬上又聳起耳朶，他想聽到一聲低微的，卑和的，「大少爺，是我。一果然，根福的聲音那　熟然地送進了他的耳朶。他心裏像開了花，面上郤還是那般綳得緊緊地問着：「事情幹好了？</p>
<p>根福像一個偷鷄賊，閃了進來。看過了少爺的面色，幽幽地說：「都是要命的事！幹了那宋許多日子，一個邊（錢）都沒有到手」！同時展了絲奸滑的笑容「心裏又想着少爺這幾大桃花棣的桃花開（，就是明天罷，根福空着二體來侍候少爺！</p>
<p>根福向後退着，無意似的坐　烟榻的另一端。一股濃厚的香味冒進他的鼻孔，根福聳了聳肩頭，「少爺，那陸家裏的土倒底是令淸貨。又裝了個　看的笑容，他等　着少爺的：根福，你香筒罷！</p>
<p>但是少爺沒有他想像地豪爽。他仰起了腦袋，用右手的食指向空劃着圈子，半晌，問根福：</p>
<p>「桃花棣向西轉了個灣，那邊有幾株大樹的是什麼地方，根福？一</p>
<p>「那是楊家棣。」</p>
<p>根福端詳看主人的臉，他知直幹了十來天差，「花花太歲」有些花性發動了。馬上坐得端正一點，祇要太歲再問下去，他可以弄牠筆來抵足十來天的白辛苦。</p>
<p>那地方你熟悉嗎？」</p>
<p>根福笑了起來：「少爺，城里城外，這團團幾十里的地方都在根福肚裏，不是吹句半，還報鬥」你聽：從桃花棣向西轉了個灣，碰面就是兩棵大樹下，一聯是二問草屋，那是朱崇卿老爺的佃戶。再過去有一家養鴨的，呌張佬頭，運裏聚豐館，得慶樓的鴨都是向他買的。再過去……」一根福掄着手指「唔，那是陸企才家了，他有個很漂亮的女兒…」</p>
<p>少爺突然跳了起來：</p>
<p>「是了！」</p>
<p>一股勁磁到烟榻上，一根福替我燒幾筒，我們慢慢地談！」</p>
<p>根福就等等着這句話·一仰身躺在烟榻下首，左　蹺到榻靠上，剛用抒子蘸起烟來，就喊着好香，好香，陸家裏的土倒底不多！</p>
<p>少爺在明白他的意思了，而上展開了一個得意的笑容。</p>
<p>「到我少爺面前裝什麼腔，香筒罷。不過這件事你要替我辦好的！」</p>
<p>「多謝少爺！根福抽出空着的一只手來拍了拍胸脯「根福沒有別的本領，這點小事倒是我的拿手戲！」</p>
<p>熟練地把烟在手指上捲着，裝上斗門，一下子抽足了兩筒，在橫頭的小茶臺裏叫了一口，彷彿驚異地呌了起火：</p>
<p>「呵，是參湯，我當是茶哩！」</p>
<p>「紙要你把事情辦妥，少爺什麼東西都捨得給你。吿訴我用什麼方法把那小妮子弄到手，愈快愈好！」</p>
<p>「便當得很。根福說着又　起烟來，一邊凑過頭去在少爺的耳邊嚕咕了一陣，「保你三天之內弄到手，不過，怎樣謝　？」</p>
<p>根福放出地痞的手段來，　着一只眼盯住少爺。少爺不耐煩地從烟榻跳起來：「你自己開價罷！」</p>
<p>「哈哈哈…」根福鷥驚似的笑了起來，「我吃了少爺這多年飯，這，點小事就要討賞？讓根福多抽一筒吧。」</p>
<p>少爺不去理會他，慢慢地踱到窗前，伸手到窗外把檐下的馬籠托了進來，彷彿逗引一個孩了似的撅起兩爿厚嘴唇呌着，那芙蓉鳥善侍主人的意思，撲着翅膀，一陣子「花花太歲，花花太歲……（完）</p>
<h3>夜的行進曲</h3>
<p>— 辛卓佳</p>
<p>在北伐的時候，曾有一次爲了避免和敵人的正面的衡突，我們繞了一個大圈子，退到一座險峻的高山。天已徑很夜了，但我們必須趁在黎明之前繼續地爬過山去，和我們的大隊滙合起來，我們的一連人　派着尖兵，但我們却疲倦得像一條死蛇一樣。三日三夜的饑餓和奔波的勞動，像個怕人的惡魔的巨手，緊緊地揑住着我們的咽喉。我們的眼睛失掉神光了，鼻空里冒着靑烟，四肢像被抽出了筋骨而且打得稀爛了似的。祇有一個共同的，明確的意念，那就是：睡，喝，和吃東西。喝水比吃東西重要，睡眠比喝水更加重要。</p>
<p>一個伙夫挑着鍋爐担子，一邊走，邊做夢，糢糢糊糊地，速人連担子統統跌入個發臭的溝渠。</p>
<p>但我們仍舊不能休息。而且更大的，夜的苦難又臨頭了。</p>
<p>橫在阻我們面前的黑默　的高山，究竟高達到如何的程度，我們全不知道。我們抬頭望着天，烏黑地，沒有星光也沒有月亮。不知道從什麼地方才能够劃分出天和山峯的界限。也許山峯比天還要高，也許我們望着的不是天，而僅僅祇是山的懸崖的石壁。總之——我們什麼都看不見。</p>
<p>我們盲目地，夢一般的模素着；個挨一個地，緊緊地把握着前一個弟兄的脚步。山路漸漸地由傾斜而倒懸，而窄狹，而迂曲，……尖石子像鋼刺一般的堅立了起來。</p>
<p>眼睛一朦朧，頭腦就覺得更加沉重而昏瞆了。要不是不時有尖角石子劃破我們的皮肉，刺痛我們的脚心，我們簡直就會不知不覺地站着或者伏着睡去了的。沒有歸宿的，夜的獸類底哀號，和山風的呼嘯，雖然時常振盪着我們的耳鼓，但我們全不在意；因爲除了饑渴和睡眠，整個的世界早就在我們的周圍消失了。</p>
<p>不知道是爬在前面的弟兄們中的哪一個，失脚踏翻了一塊大大的岩石什麼東西，轆轆地滾下無底洞般的山澗中了。官長們便大發脾氣地傳佈着命令：</p>
<p>「要是誰不能忍耐，要是誰不小心！……要是誰不服從命令！……」</p>
<p>然而接着：又是一聲，兩聲……夾着銳利的號呌，沉重而且柔韌地滾了下去！</p>
<p>這很顯然地不是岩石的墜落！</p>
<p>部隊立時停頓了下來。並目出於這驟然地奇突的刺激，而引起了龐大的喧鬧！</p>
<p>「怎樣的？誰？什麼事情？……」官長們戰聲呌着！因爲不能爬越到前面去視察，就祇得老遠地打着驚悸的訊問。</p>
<p>『報告：前面的路越加狹窄了！……總共不到一尺寬，而且又不看見！……連偵探兵做的記號我們都摸不着了！……跌下去了兩個人！……」</p>
<p>『不行！……不能停在這裏！』官長們更加粗暴地叫着，命令着：『要是誰不小心！……要是誰不服從命令！……』</p>
<p>『報吿——實在爬不動了！肚皮又餓，口又渴，眼睛又不看見！……』</p>
<p>『槍斃！誰不服從命令的？……』</p>
<p>三四分鐘之後，我們又惶懼，機械而且昏迷地攀爬着。每一個人的身子都完全不能自主了。祇有一個唯一的希望是——馬上現出黎明，馬上爬過山頂，滙合着我們的大隊，而不分晝夜的痛痛快快地睡他一整星期！</p>
<p>當這痛苦的爬行又繼續了相當久的時間，而摸着了偵探尖兵們所留下的——快要到山頂了的——特殊　記號的時候，我們的進行突然地又停頓起來了。這回却不是跌下去了人，而是給什麼東西截斷了我們的。艱難底前路！</p>
<p>『報吿——前面完全崩下去了！看不淸楚有多少寬窄，一步都爬不過去了！……」</p>
<p>『那麼，偵探兵呢？』長官們疑懼地反問。</p>
<p>『不知道！……』</p>
<p>一種非常不吉利的徵兆，突然地刺激着官長們的昏沉的腦子！「是的，」他們互相地商量，應當馬上派兩個傳令兵去報吿後面的大隊！……我們祇能暫時停在這里了。讓工兵連到來時，再設法開一條臨時的路徑！……也許，天就要亮了的！……」</p>
<p>我們認爲這是一個意外的，給我們休息的最好底機會，雖然我們明知危險性非常重大！……我們的背脊一靠着岩壁，我們的脚一軟，眼瞼就像着了磁石一般的上下吸了攏來。整個地身子飄浮起來了。睡神用了牠的黑色的，大的翅翼，捲出了我們的困倦的靈魂！</p>
<p>是什麼時候現出黎明的，我們全不知道。當官長命令着班長們各別地拉着我們的耳朶，捶着我們的腦壳而將我們搖醒的時候，我們已經望見我們的後隊蜿蜒地爬上來了。而且立時間從對面的山巓上，響來了一排斑密的，敵人底兇猛的射擊！……</p>
<p>我們本能地擎着槍，撥開了保險機，聽取着班長們傳誦的命令。因爲我不到掩護，便倉皇而且笨重地就地躺將下來，也開始兇殘地還擊着！……</p>
<h3>自殺者（一）</h3>
<p>— 千冬</p>
<p>夜深了。</p>
<p>藍醫生關門的聲音很淸脆地響着，砰！連已經駛出了醫院鬥外那乘救護車，在這裏急診間裏還聽得出沙沙沙輪子輾轉的聲音。夜是很寂靜啦。</p>
<p>藍醫生打個呵欠，皺着眉頭，正伸出手來到這急診間中間的五百燭電燈光下預備看一看手錶，現在究竟有幾點鐘了？忽然，他轉過頭去，似乎聽到什麼東西響着的樣子，眼睛驚了一下，立刻又恢復常態，把臉向着門外的電梯等待着。</p>
<p>電梯下來了。一個戴黑帽子，着黑色燕尾服，長着滿面長鬍鬚的牧師忽忙地走出來。左手緊緊夾着一個黑色的皮包，右手正拿着一塊手帕擦那血紅的大鼻子。這好像是他習慣的動作。擦了一下，大鼻子上暫時平靜了，一會兒又現出一顆顆的汗珠來，於是又擦了一下。</p>
<p>他動一動濃簇的眉毛，把皮包放在長凳上，在擦着鼻子的手帕下響着喜悅的有力的喉音。</p>
<p>「Dr．蓋，說是救護車出去了，又是一個自殺的人。是不？」</p>
<p>「是。」藍醫生又懶懶地打個呵欠，繞着手術床的周圍踱着。</p>
<p>「好，那末，你，」牧師很興奮地叫着，手帕又狠狠地擦了一下，「你得小心！一個自殺者當他悔悟的時候，是比常人更深切，囚爲自殺者是比普通人更能體會自己的罪惡！」</p>
<p>牧師笑了，這種笑容只有從天眞的小孩子的臉上才可以看到。而且聲音很洪亮，霍霍霍霍！藍醫生給他駭了一跳，停了一下，看他一眼，於是又繼續緩緩地一步步踱着了。</p>
<p>牧師覺得自己的話太聰明了，已經能够引得別人的驚奇，立刻更得意地叫起來：</p>
<p>「我又記得，我又肥得，早晨出院的那個鄉下人了　Dr．藍，你記得嗎？」</p>
<p>「那一個？」藍醫生淡淡然說着，還是繞他的圈子。</p>
<p>「就是昨天進來的那個鄉下人。用繩子吊在江灣路旁邊的樹上自殺，這蠢貨，要是那裏沒有路燈，他眞的可以達到目的了。不是嗎？當他在這裏淸醒過來的時候，你還問他：「你們爲什麼要自殺？弄得人家麻煩死了！』我還記得他苦巴己的說着，他是務農的，因爲鄕下水災跑到上海來，到上海也種過菜，當過小販，挑夫。現在連這些事情都沒有做了，只有自殺。就是那僩，就是那個呀！」</p>

<h3>兩椿驚人的大案件</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>最近國內發生二椿驚人的大案伴，一椿是壽光縣的大刦案，一椿是天津的大綁案。</p>
<p>濟南通訊：壽光縣縣立南河小學校，上月二十八日，突被土匪二十餘名闖進，並將該校包圍，時校長及各敎員等，均赴復興油房參觀新式機器，故未在校，匪等除女生六名外，餘五十餘人，均用細麻繩綑縛，臨行鳴砲二百餘響，及越圍墻，有十餘歲以下之兒童二十餘名，力弱不支，當被遣回，抵濁北莊時，逃回學生三人，抵營子莊時，又逃回一人，據云，匪因帶學生，行動異常遲緩，該案發生後，縣長頗爲焦灼，立卽派隊分別截堵追擊，終無相當營救方法，聞校長協同各學生家長，不日卽到省請願，以期早日救回。</p>
<p>天津訊：津英法日租界當局，十七日先後在立興里同善里竹遠里永豐里泰昌里等處，起出被匪綁架勒斃及活埋男屍七具，死狀甚慘，此案匪犯，上週內已經英法工部局，協同偵獲七名，內女匪一名，在偵查中，匪綁架肉票，均令婦女勾引至目的地殺斃，然後致函事主家屬勒贖，據警察調查，此批綁匪，在平津活動，已有兩年之久。</p>
<p>此兩椿案件，的確非常駭人聽聞。壽光縣士匪二十餘人，敢在靑天白日下，公然闖進南河小學校，據去學生五十餘名，此一事態的嚴重，是極値得關心的。擄入事伴在我國時有所聞，然未見有向小學校擄刦，且一刦刦至五十餘人者。此種無法無天的行爲，惟一輩罪大惡極的匪徒，有胆量冒險，考其擄人目的，殆欲刦往各地販賣，此事的發生，依情形看，破獲似甚容易。蓋一方匪衆因携帶學生，行動旣經遲緩，他方又有幾名學生逃回，當有一點綫索可尋。但縣府派隊分別截堵追擊的結果，竟終無相當營救方法，任令匪徒從容逃脫，眞屬憾事。今後當局若不早速設法營救，不惟幾十名小學生無法救回，此類刦案亦有重演之虞。責任問題，猶其餘事也。</p>
<p>至若天津大綁案，其情節的重大，亦有不容忽視者。本來綁匪架人，目的在勒贖，非至不得已，必不肯撕票。而此等匪徒之綁架肉票，則令婦女勾引至目的地殺斃，然後致函事主家屬勒贖，其行爲實屬殘酷之至。此案件的發生，有一事殊値得注意，即七具屍體，均於租界內起出。租界在我國，往往成爲一班匪徒作惡爲非之地。此關係於我國治安，眞非淺少。又此批綁匪，在平津一帶活動，旣有兩年之久，其規模之大，與組織的嚴密，可以想見。今當局已拘獲匪犯七名，自應嚴行偵查，以期肅淸匪衆，而絕後患。此我人所最希望者。</p>
<h3>輪下小唱</h3>
<p>— 綠葉</p>
<p>我的生涯和我的素性，顯然是在不同的界限裏面；那灰色的生涯時時在磨礪着我，靑春在輪子下葬送了歲月還時時在剝蝕我的生命。我心底，在玫瑰色的童年時代，所蘊藏着一種金鑛，裏面有着林擒色的生命憧憬，那是豪邁潑刺底放浪者的生活，只能永遠的潛伏着吧</p>
<p>（我想着我的願望，那有着美麗的金鑛藏着，在自由放浪者生涯中，我也想做一個海上的鼓手荒島上的流亡的盜賓者。）</p>
<p>何時可以忘去在皮帶輪子壓碎的呢？我也有着飛揚技扈偉大的氣概，這氣槪使我生出一種海外流亡的留戀，那生命將完全是在薔薇色的裏面，粗野而敦樸的生命哪！我可以同着一批粗野高大的放浪者們，一同拾着海濱金色的貝殼，或是開懷暢飲忘情地高唱，唱着這放浪者桃色的戀歌；想到那印度特有的產品的加厘，一種辛辣的滋味，可以刺痛了舌尖的新的刺激，和西伯利亞頗有趣的風光，永遠是朔風和凛寒佔了世界；再會繫念到赤道綫上面的南國風味的榴速和椰子，那一種甜美的味道，令人羨慕的吧。在這裏和那裏是沒有了那殘酷的皮帶輸子的束縛，我是一個自由的小鳥，我永遠懷戀着這粗擴的生活了。</p>
<p>輪子下，曾是磨朴了許多年靑小夥子的靈魂；相着，皮帶和輪子是永遠給我咀咒和詬詈的啊。墓地，一陣子的哆　和恐懼，一根根的白骨彷彿在我的眼前閃現；是時代埋沒的記憶吧，這時，已不能在這灰色的生涯裏，再記得那悠長的歲月中許多年靑男子的隕命了。</p>
<p>我企求着林擒色放浪者的生涯中，聽聆那荒島的松濤，和一片稀有秀樸的秋色；夜晚，看那海上美麗的星子，在天空密密麻麻的織着，似一羣樂園里的孩子們，那時我可以記憶那玫瑰色童年的憨情和歡樂，同一批放浪者互相絮話着舊情，一陣陣粗野率直的笑語在我們遭點綴。我們可以互相調笑着大家的痴情和女人們的趣話。這裏祇有着天眞和忠實。</p>
<p>提到星，我有些憂鬱，在我們這淋隘的屋子裏，後有一扇窗，或是一扇邊門，只有在屋頂上，框裝着一小方天窗，在淡有疎星之夜，可以望到三四點星子，嵌在天窗上面，有一二綫靑光射下來，織在輪子飛快的旋轉中，輸影在逐漸的擴大着，緩緩掩滿了全屋。</p>
<p>可是現在，在烏黑的髮照中也綴上了一二點稀疏星星的霜花了，在皮帶輪子下的過程中，我的靑春早已葬沒了，我始終是沒有得到一些季節的秋天和春天的溫馨的安慰。</p>
<p>心地已在灰燼的時侯了，沒有了溫馨，也沒有了光明，像岩石一般日久在逐漸剝落，時間的奔流裏捲去了我心底潛伏着馥郁而金鑛質的放浪者夢幻的生活。</p>
<p>輪子下的世界啊！……</p>
<h3>傷風之什</h3>
<p>— 胡思</p>
<p>每當季節交替的當兒，每每要犯着傷風。一來身體弱，先天旣不足，後天的保養也未全。近來因生活忙迫，身邊的瑣事更未遑照顧，對於切身的安全，竟不能顧及，那麼像「傷風頭痛」諸小病，自然容易侵入，而幾天的頭昏眼脹，竟是不能避免的了。</p>
<p>說傷風是小病，那自然因爲牠可以不吃藥便自瘉，沒有洋鈿的人病起來倒是沒有什麼相干的。雖然據說有錢的衛生家，主張傷風並非微小之症，因爲病一侵害着肺部，那可並不是玩的。然而以一個窮文友來說，與其犯着「醫院症」，（那是說：非入醫院不行。）母寗犯着像傷風般的「家中病」。因爲侵害肺部的事終究少有，而在窮措的時光，破起鈔來倒是事非小可的。</p>
<p>可是說傷風全於事無礙，那又未必盡然。一傷起風來，頭昏眼脹固不必說，便是眼淚鼻涕，也成天流個不完。閱書旣頭昏，毫無興味；寫文也不行，毫無靈感可說。便是勉强提起筆桿來，也</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>須一邊留着一條濕手巾，一邊抹眼淚鼻涕，一邊又要揮着筆桿在紙上進行。偶然打起個噴嚏來，還須留心；否則紙上噴了水點，寫文的工作定要受了許多沮礙。</p>
<p>恃賣文爲活的人，精神是不可少的生活資源。精神一缺乏，成日間無精打采，沈入昏濛濛的狀態，那麼文章寫不成，生活便失了保障了。傷風對於窮文友的災害，便是足使精神疲憊不振，腦筋衰弛，間接便是對於作品和生活有所打擊了。所以文友之怕傷風，說起來實和有錢的衛生家沒有兩樣。不過「雨害權其輕」，如果害起其他須要破鈔的病症，還不如傷風的好，那倒是窮人們的如意算盤，打得不會一差二錯的。——自然最好還是做只鐵牛，完全不會頭昏腹痛。可是　上有幾個人，尤其是營養不足和少得休養的窮小子的文友，能够完全免得病痛呢？</p>
<p>再有覺得討厭的，便是一傷了風，終要經過幾天才能復原。這是全無辦法的，你得儘讓眼淚鼻涕，不住地流和滴，直流爽快才行。你也得儘讓頭昏眼脹，昏脹個飽滿，然後才有辦法。可是這於一個一天不寫文章便沒有飯吃的人，你想這對於他將有什麼損害呢？</p>
<p>由於傷風，更容易令人兜起了傷感。人的脾氣是像風雲般的易起變幻的。平常溫和的性情，活潑的心性，一經過幾天的頭昏眼脹，和哭喪的臉孔，是會失意灰頹，而現出自暴自棄的心情和行動來的。自然是，人已不是小孩兒家了，那當然缺乏慈母之照顧；更加如果是獨身，或者愛人兒不在身邊，那時的戚傷將是更大，而或種可笑和可憐的動作，是會做出來的；或種無聊的感覺或　想，是會觸發出來的、這對於帶着濃厚的神經質的文人，更是不能避免的吧？我想有些偉大的文學家，在他們傷風的時光，或許會寫出有名的傷感的文章來吧？這並不完全是忘記和幻想，我敢斷定。</p>
<h3>馬六甲</h3>
<p>— 從龍</p>
<p>馬六甲素稱「椰國古城」，古蹟名勝，隨處皆是，風景秀麗，不讓六朝金粉的金陵，玩是玩不盡的。</p>
<p>據說太平湖風景甲於南島，可惜我沒有遊過，未得領略；但芙蓉却曾遊過多次，那兒雖缺少恬靜滿含着詩意的水色，然羣巒蒼翠，皇家山的蒼碧，幽靜，眞够說得上「山靈鍾秀」的呵！聽一般到過太平湖的人說：「芙蓉是勝太平一籌的」。因爲芙蓉的好處是在於山巒蒼翠；倘使你在皇家山的曲徑上漫步，你便可以領略「山窮水盡疑無路，柳暗花明又一村」的別有饒趣的風味。馬六甲雖則依山傍水，然而沒有芙蓉那樣蒼翠的丘陵，不然，這「椰國古城」的山光水色，怕不弱於南歐的瑞士呵！</p>
<p>馬六甲從來在歷史上，傅說上就很有名的，可是，現在航業發達，同時因爲它的海港太淺的綠故，不能停泊巨大的郵船，以致失去世界的交通大港的位置，但它在世界史上去佔着重要百一頁，祇從溝通近代東西文化這一點上的史蹟，那就不能湮沒和抹煞的。當一三七七年的時候，爪哇新興的Menjapahit王國，攻滅了獅島和Palempang王國，於是，馬六甲成爲馬來人唯一的避難所，同時，並在這兒建立馬六甲王國。當文化極盛的時侯，曾經名震遠近，我國也曾遣使來到這裏，據明史的記載，云明永樂三年（一四〇五年）鄭和南巡，曾冊封此地。馬六甲也是歐人東來最先取得的殖民地，一五一一年葡將亞比克克統率艦隊佔此，那時的建築，至今猶存，給遊人追懷，憑弔，所以，現在一般到南洋羣島的人，總要到馬六甲來逛一趟</p>
<p>「升旗山」是馬六甲的古績之一，這山的名字却時常變史，它原是跟山上的禮拜堂的名稱而異的。當葡屬時代，山項上建築、一聖母堂，因此，山名也就叫做聖母山了。直至荷屬時代，改建聖保羅堂，故這山也就改稱爲聖保羅山了。這座古敎堂於荷蘭攻佔馬六甲的時候，毀於砲火，現在僅存四壁和聖擠。當我們走進這古敎堂裏，但見　隙中長着蔓草靑苔，木禁油然地感到一種戰後的荒凉的可怕的意味。歷史學會爲保存這歷史上的古蹟，特在堂裏竪立一方古碑。聖壇的中央，有一地窑，上蓋鐵欄，相傳是神父方濟埋骨之所；又據熟悉馬六甲的老年人說，這神父的骸骨於一五五三年遷葬於印度的「哥亞」了。</p>
<p>古敎堂的前面，建燈塔一座，環山築有極堅固的城堡，這是葡人在東方的建築。城堡的中心是儲藏庫，建在面海近河的地方？以便與海上交通聯絡，以這兒爲中心，有六個稜堡掩護，其中的一個稜堡遺跋，晚近已在匯豐銀行處發見，現歷史學會正在匯豐銀行的對面山麓發掘，找尋葡屬時代的建築物的原址。目下經已證實，從前的海水能直達城下，桑田滄海，眞不勝今昔之慨！在山頭上展望，環顧四週，隱約可想像出當時的情景，柳陰人家，水繞城廓的盛况了。</p>
<p>政府公署前的小丘，特植一樹，名叫馬六甲樹，本坡原產極多，但近因砍伐殆盡，故特植以爲紀念。關於這樹，却有一有趣的傅說：謂當時貴族康丁蕭王在海濱打獵的時候，獵犬追鹿，反被鹿逐之入海，王驚叫起來：「此眞福地，雖鹿也勇」！於是建都於此，就以他所休息的這馬六甲樹名這新都。</p>
<p>從升旗山下來，沿海邊的福特路走去，有一座跨海的長橋，行不多遠，就看見一座用紅土磚砌成靈光獨存的城門，古木參天，這是本坡人士工餘閒眺的勝地，每當夕陽西下，在這兒悠然閒步，眞是再好沒有了，尤其是在靑龍木花盛開的時節，滿地黃花，乘凉風，低吟哦，白日間辛苦的勞動，這時却全都消逝得乾乾凈凈了。</p>
<p>「三保山」是本坡飲水的源泉，附近有許多水井，均名爲「三保井」，相傳謂鄭和曾至此，這些水井都是鄭和鑿出來的，然這也許是一種附會的傳說？三保山並不甚高，且山腰有許多壘壘的荒塚，山道也極崎嶇難行：山頂有氣象臺，全坡在望，前臨大海，港灣歷歷，背後羣巒蒼翠，與升旗山，約翰山遙相對峙，炊烟相望，鷄犬之聲相聞，風景之佳，織成這美麗的「椰國古城」。</p>

<h3>我與梅生</h3>
<p>— 趙丹</p>
<p>在銀幕上，我所飾演的角色，常常是很Sentimental的。</p>
<p>在「夜來香」裏，我還是做了這樣一個神經質的人；不過不是一向慣做的如識份子，而是一個感情單純的農家少年。</p>
<p>「夜來香」是一個戀愛的悲劇。這影片裏所描寫的，正如它的命名一樣，故事很多感艷成分。悲劇的主人翁，一個是賣花女阿香，（胡蝶飾）一個便是我所飾的少年梅生。梅生是和阿香戀愛着的，而另、一個村女阿金（舒繡文飾）却　單戀着梅生，後來，阿香卻被一個上海　的闊少，（孫敏飾）奪了去，梅生失了戀，終於悒悒不歡地和阿金結婚了；但結果，梅生還是爲阿香犧牲了自己。</p>
<p>像梅生那樣的靑年，自然是不足爲訓的。但我飾演這角色的時候：却深深地爲這可憐的靑年所感動。因爲這角色所表現的，不止是懲愛的酸辛，而是一抹濃烈的人生苦味；隱在這不平的黃金社會的戀愛悲劇後面的，又正是一個嚴重的社會問題。</p>
<p>我想：銀幕的梅生，假如不是我演得太不像樣的話，也許會得到觀衆若干的同情的吧？</p>
<h3>西施拾零</h3>
<p>— 多</p>
<p>二十二日上午九時上海劇院假座下爾登試演樂劇西施。</p>
<p>劇分五幕，新製佈景四堂（四五幕同景）均極富麗。</p>
<p>總導演陳大悲先生曾兩次到幕前來致「廢話」，記者因坐位太遠，聽得不大淸楚，大概說上次的」摩登夫人」有人批評是「文明戲」，其理由是什麼呢？因爲沒有歌，沒有舞，現在的「西施」可以稱為「野蠻戲」吧。</p>
<p>是的，一西加」是頗爲熱鬧的：有獨唱，合唱，男舞，女舞，陳歌辛和吳曉邦兩位先生的努力所致。</p>
<p>但是該劇除第一塲勾踐見吳王之外，頗有京劇氣味，如對白，動作，（服裝因爲是古裝戲，不能非議）有人提議該劇山麒麟童前飾勾踐，後飾伍員，當更”精彩，但是這是笑話。</p>
<p>最後一塲勾踐等在姑蘇台上向天高呼：「西施的靈魂是永遠不死！」、傳得掌聲不少。</p>
<p>「西施」是成功的？</p>
<p>該劇六日將在卡爾登公演，轉達陳先一生的「廢話，請諸位多多介紹親友。</p>

<h3>模範村之將來</h3>
<p>— 小昂</p>
<p>迈年來建築界，有一種新的趨勢，新的發展，就是模範村的設計和建築了，這種新事業的發源，是從上海起的，因為牠合乎中國人民的需要，尤其是在都市的人民，所以不到一二年的工夫，這種新的建築，也就風起雲湧了。現在的南京，北平，天津，廣州，漢口，靑島，以及其他比較繁華的地方，都有模範村的建築出現，誠然，這是中國最好的現象，也是建築界最好的機會，不過談到牠的設計方面不免過於洋化些，中國有中國的制度，人民有傳統的習慣，如果仿效西洋一切的辦法，結果總是不好的，我曾經參觀過上海幾個　範新村，建築可謂富麗，空氣可謂新鮮，這些都是貴族式的住宅，不是普通一班人民所需要的，所以我也來談談模範村的將來，中國人民所需要的模範村的將來。</p>
<p>（一）普通一般之設計</p>
<p>中國人有一個最不好的習慣，就是沒有團結心，猶如一般散沙，模範村的設計，要藉建築的連接，來使同住在一村的人民都有相互友愛的關係，然後使他們慢慢地團結起來，中國政府現在實行的保甲制度，就是一個最好的辦法，模範村的設計，應以一甲（卽十家）爲一小單位，以一保（卽百家）爲一村，十家的住宅，應當建築在一塊，還有一個小的辦公處，有甲長的寫字間，公共娛樂的處所，其他幾甲的住宅，也是一樣的設計，然後在適中的地方，建築一個保長的辦公處，其中包含保長的寫字間，公共集會的禮堂，公共醫院也可以附設在內，如果求學的兒童很多的話，初級小學也可以設立在內，這樣一來，同住在一村的人民，接觸的機會，一定很多，自然一天一天的親密起來，一年一年的團結了。</p>
<p>（二）位置之選擇</p>
<p>位置的選擇，是一個最重要的問題，因爲住在村裏的人民，他們不是資產階級，而是中下等的入民，他們很少自備汽車和摩托車，但是每天要去辦公，朝出暮歸，藉以代步的當然是公共汽車和電車了，新村的位置，應當在交通便利的地方，在上海這地方，交通太便利，地價一定很貴，空氣不一定新鮮，所以在滬西的大西路中山路和江灣的市府路一帶，是最好的了，其他要注意的，就是在附近一帶要有小小的市鎭，以便日常所需的食品，可以隨意購得，在一公里的地方，要有大小工廠，因爲許多婦女，白天也可以作工，能維持生計，電燈和自來水的問題，也應該考慮一下，如果沒有電燈，當然是不方便，如果自來水廠因爲種種關係不能供給飲水，那就是一個很嚴重的問題了，因爲飲料不潔，有碍衛生，那麼與建築新村的目的，背道而馳了。</p>
<p>（三）建築物之設計</p>
<p>模範村的住宅，是以小家庭爲單位，所以一樓一底的房屋，就可以夠用，一間客廳，膳堂當然在內，二間宿舍，一問洗滌室，和一問廚房，牠的平面面積是多不過16x4o，磚頭的顏色，最好是桃紅色和黃色，因爲早上太陽出來的時候，房屋的顏色，很有朝氣，也可以提起一部份人的精神來，窗戶和門戶，最好是朝東和朝南，這些都是淺而易見的東西，不過也値得研究牠的原理和法則，建築物的四周，應當廣植花木，桃柳是春天景色最適宜的，桂花樹和楓樌是秋天的點級，竹松是冬天最好的了，運動塲也要好好的設計，業餘的運動，以網球最適宜，小朋友的小球塲，那是絕對不可少的哩。</p>
<h3>住宅的最新構成（上）</h3>
<p>— 市浦健著　張黃正譯</p>
<p>（一）住宅的機能</p>
<p>住宅佔建築中最重要的地位，此盡人皆知。欲求用更貼切的文句表明住宅的本質，那就是法國有名建築家克爾畢安氏所謂的一家屋是住的機械」。這句話的意義，决不是說住宅必須機械地建造。其意思祗是說住宅的產生，無論如何，目的是爲了住居。</p>
<p>總而言之，起初當住宅成爲建築的起源而發生時，其最主要的目的，是避免自然界的威脅。在今日，這點同樣亦爲主要目的，不過此外更加上耐久性的要求，於是件宅便更趨發展。抵耐自然界的威脅如雨雪，寒暑，地震，水害及防火，耐濕等，因之極爲人們所注意。這樣看來，若欲求住居家屋內的人類生活快適，則家屋必需完備的構造。</p>
<p>然，因爲住宅完全是住的機械，故單祇構造完善，還未達充分滿意。一個機械，其設計興組合方面，是和該機械以怎樣優良的材料堅牢地製作，佔同樣重要的價値。故在一般建築上，必須知道佈置的設計及各種設備，其價値與構造有同樣的重要。尤其是與生活發生最密切關係的住宅，更不能不從事於全體統制的設計。</p>
<p>（二）住宅的構造</p>
<p>以下本打算對此等具體問題加以探討。然，爲簡單淸晰起見，茲祇就構造與設備一述。在一般的建築構造中，主要是積砌磚瓦作牆壁，柱上架梁，下舖地板。此種構造，與木造或鋼骨水門汀造有力學上的區別。</p>
<p>然，在今日，爲適應現代生活，便必然要求更完備的構造。向這方面的研求，是非常重要。至少必須能做到使防水，防熟，防火，防濕，防音的機能，有滿意的効果。不過同時更須注意到耐久性，修繕改造容易，且價格便宜。當然，求以一二種材料能兼具此等要求，是沒有道理而且不可能的事。故必須以多種材料分負此等責任，因而組合完善的建築物。在此意義中，便必然會引起人們注意於工業地製作材料的。由於工期縮短於是價格跟着便宜的「乾式構造」。這就是那所謂於建築塲所不使用水　祇張架鐵或木的骨架以作成建築物的構造。此種樣式，在住宅及工廠方面，已有不少被使用。不用說，乾式構造法當然仍有許多未完善的缺點。無疑的，將來必有更完善的構造法出現。</p>
<p>（三）住宅的設備</p>
<p>靠了構造，已能防禦自然界大部份的威脅。原始的住宅，不知構造以外的手段，不作文化程度以上的要求。但由於一般文化發展而造成生活的進步與科學的進步，除促進構造自身的發展外，同時更進而生出了種種設備。寒冷時的探煖法，夜間的照明，燃料動力供給與使用的方法，給水的方法，排泄物的處理方法等，使住宅全體成爲一複雜的機械及有機的組織體。</p>
<p>就中特別發達的是屋內氣候調節的技術。比諸外面氣候卽室內氣候的太古住宅，已逐漸興外面疎遠的近代住屋，爲了衛生的設施，於是乎而冬有煖房，夏有冷室，與煖房冷室同樣，更以各種方法自由調節空氣的溫度與濕度。關於取溫方法，用炭火固極便宜；但旣不合衛生，且諸多不便及危險，已不適於時代的需求。又，煤氣除了比較簡便這一點外，與炭火有同樣的缺點。於衛生及處理上可說是理想的電氣，其唯一缺點是非常高價，普及困難，欲求最初設備費用較省，經費低廉，快適而無危險，那祇有蒸氣或溫水煖房。尤其是溫水煖房，溫度旣不會過高，且處理簡單，最適合住宅使用。其燃料除煤外，還有簡便的重油；又，煤方面亦有自動給煤機，可以說是非常簡便的。</p>
<h3>中國古代建築之內部分析（下）</h3>
<p>— 穉雲</p>
<p>（五）柱——中國建築上面所用的柱，與別國完全不同而有它的特點。別國的造屋，必先建起了柱子而後於其上建築屋頂，中國的建築，却先作好了屋頂之結架，而定柱子的位置。所用的木材，大都是松木。結架和頂椽的堅實，完全是依賴柱子立在石磴上的力。但頂橡下却有托架支撐。托架的數目很多，且有裝飾性的。中國的柱，不論是寺院，牌樓，宮殿，民房，都是無雙的重要。猶如其他風格中，柱頭爲建築中最重要的一樣。柱子不論是如宮殿的自由獨立，或者是算爲墻壁的一部，都是沒有柱頭的，並且直接接於那垂直壓下之長方屋頂的頂椽。而這柱和頂，即爲宮殿式建築的主要物。其　半燒的墻，並沒有　築上的價値。</p>
<p>（六）雕飾——在中國，頂和柱爲主要的建築物；而且其建築，多爲磚石和木材。至於裝飾，則用疏璃瓦。在裝飾中，雕飾只佔一小部份。在事實上講，雕飾也和其他風格是一樣的，牆瓦伸入，則雕飾伸出，波形的，圓形的，方形的，剜形的，在木柱的銅基上可以看出，但因爲沒有柱頭，所以在柱身上也沒有了。簡單的雕飾，在托支頂橡的托架上，可以尋到，然而也不過施以奇異的雕刻。牠們也被用於嵌線的圓殿的附物上。但是在殿與塔上，這種浮雕，都可以在重疊的頂的特別翻轉向上的檐下，可以找到。</p>
<p>（七）裝飾——中國的裝飾，表演着一種國民的特性，東方的國民，都表演出一種對於色彩的自然本能，中國人當然不能例外。色彩計劃，形成了中國建築的大部。屋頂蓋了閃光的瓦。黃色的，施於宮殿；紅色的，施於官吏；藍的，綠的，紫的，施於其他各分。外露的屋脊，加以深色的龍，魚，及其一切異形怪狀琉璃瓦。</p>
<p>不論在什麼地方，畫上一些畫是算美觀的。不要說宮殿中要來裝飾；就是平民斯住的房屋，也何嘗不要。</p>
<p>在看了內地一設的建築，可以知道中國的國民性了。</p>
<h3>室內配光之研究（上）</h3>
<p>— 欽</p>
<p>室內光綫之配合，實爲建築中極重要之工作。同一房屋，同一佈置，若光綫之强度不等，色彩之配合有異，則往往邏更人之感覺使生喜悅或厭惡之心理。而工作其中者亦往往因光綫之刺激，或致易生怠惰之心，或使與奮有爲。故無論住宅居室，工廠學校及公共集合塲所皆應對於光綫之配合加以十二分之注意。</p>
<p>我人應知室內光綫配合適當時其利益實非淺鮮，簡略言之，則（一）可以减少目力之緊張，蓋過强過弱之光綫皆足以使目力緊張而耗費人之精神；（二）可以减少疲乏及精神上之刺激，蓋光綫配合相宜，自使人威到安適，精神就此振興；（三）可以减少意外事件之發生，此則如在工廠之中，工人因精神刺激過甚而生疲困，於是機件之應用失當，注意力漸次薄弱，而禍事卽容易發生矣；（四）可以增進人之道德觀念，人當愉快之時，其心理必存善念，反之當頹唐之時卽易起邪心，此光綫之配合所以必須使人感覺喜悅而增進其道德觀念也；（五）可以增加工作之效率，其理由實甚明顯，不外使人安樂而專心從事而已。然欲求光綫之配合適宜，非對於光學及心理學有相當之認識不可，同時於各種彩色之應用亦應有相當之研究，方能使室內之佈置與裝飾齊整美觀。</p>
<p>室內所需光綫可以普通與輔助兩種。普通之光綫應使其和平淸爽，令人覺戚安適，無强烈之刺激，其光綫之强度須視各室之應用不同而異。輔助之光綫亦可稱爲專一之光綫，蓋其應用乃爲對於室內特種工作情形而設，如讀書，圖畫，縫紉，或其他之工作。此種工作需要較强之光綫，與淸晣之視覺，故普通燈光實不足以適其需要，須另有輔助或專一之光綫設備而後可。此外應注意之點如（一）極强與眩目之光綫須完全避免，凡直射之日光，燈光，與自磨光面上反射來之光綫均須避免之；（二）利用白色牆壁與天花板等反射物體使光綫錯落不致耀目；（三）光綫應具日光色或極淺藍色所以保護目光，遇較强之燈光最好用乳白色燈罩或砂而燈泡以减其刺激性；（四）光綫强弱之分配亦須視物體之色彩如何而定，蓋吾人所見之光綫乃自物體反射而來者，若色暗之物體則必須有較强之光綫照射其上，反之，宜用較弱之光綫。</p>

<h3>Muyang Liutang River Embankment Breached; Donghai and Guanyun Also Report Critical Situation</h3>
<p>Villages near the breach have been submerged; laborers have retreated to defend the Chaimi River</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Hai Telegram: On the 19th night, the old embankment of the Liutang River in Muyang County breached. On the 20th night, the new embankment at Sanjie Village continued to breach in several places, making it impossible to repair the breaches. The laborers protecting the embankment have all retreated to defend the Chaimi River embankment as a last line of defense. The breach is located near the Fangmatou on the left bank of the Liutang River, measuring seventy meters in length. Villages nearby have been submerged. Donghai, located downstream of Muyang, faces a critical situation. The county government has sealed off civilian boats, mooring them at Xinpu and various inland river locations, in preparation for rescue efforts. In Guanyun, for over twenty li from Tanggou to Yangkou, the water is level with the banks. At Geji Guanzhuang and other places where the Lian River converges, there are over a dozen dangerous sections. Guanyun and Lianjiang plan to combine their labor forces to jointly reinforce the embankments and form a rescue team to patrol and guard the area. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Hai Telegram: For days, the Yellow River's floodwaters have surged, putting both Liutang and Guanyun counties in a tight spot. The Muyang embankment has repeatedly breached. In Guanyun, the water is level with the banks, and Donghai has sealed off boats in preparation for emergencies. In the future, all the Yellow River floodwaters will flow through Liutang, and the consequences for the Hai region are unimaginable. Although the water level north of Xuzhou has been relatively stable recently, it continues to rise, indicating that the inflow from upstream has not stopped. The water continues to be discharged along the canal without end. Xuzhou has already suffered disaster, and Hai will continue to suffer its effects. The Hai region has jointly telegraphed the central government to quickly block the breach in western Shandong to save the people of Hai and maintain salt tax revenues. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Tongshan Disaster Relief Branch was established yesterday, with Wang Gongyu, Dai Ziqiang, and Su Qiliu elected as standing committee members to oversee disaster relief efforts. Flat-price sales of grain will begin immediately to aid the disaster victims. The three counties of Pei, Feng, and Pi have also received orders from the Commissioner's Office to establish disaster relief branches simultaneously to oversee disaster relief affairs in their respective counties. The Commissioner's Office plans to select able-bodied men from among the disaster victims to handle embankment repair, road construction, and river dredging work to facilitate production and reconstruction. The plan is currently being drafted. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) According to information from the Department of Reconstruction, after the flow rate of the Middle Canal reached over 1,400 cubic meters per second, the flow rate of the Liutang River also increased, creating a critical situation. Thanks to the county magistrates of Shudong and Guanyun counties personally leading laborers to the work site for emergency repairs, the situation was reported to be under control. However, recently, due to high tides and the flooding of the Huai River being pushed back by the tide, causing poor drainage, the water level of the Liutang River suddenly rose. The Chailai River was also reported to be in an emergency, leading to a recent incident on the northern embankment of the Liutang River near Yangkou, causing a disaster in Shuyang County. Fortunately, it was not too severe. Currently, Shudong and Guanyun counties are mobilizing laborers to reinforce the embankments and provide relief to the disaster victims. Engineers have also been dispatched from the Huai River Diversion to the Sea Project Office to provide guidance, in the hope of preventing the disaster area from expanding. (23rd Dispatch, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) After the Yellow River floodwaters were diverted into the Liutang River, the water flow was quite turbulent. Shuyang and Guanyun are now rushing to reinforce the Yao embankment to prevent further flooding. The breaches within Huaiyin County have been repaired, and the embankment has been raised by one meter. They are now rushing to prepare accumulated soil. (23rd Dispatch, Central News Agency)</p>

The conversation lasted half an hour. Sir Frederick, speaking in the car, summarized his mission to China as an investigation of the financial and economic situation, which can be divided into three points: 1. To study issues related to British economic cooperation with China. 2. The British market in China has declined in recent years due to various reasons. He intends to study and find ways to rescue British merchants in China in order to revive the market. 3. To understand the current state of various economic organizations in China in recent years, as well as the progress of construction and production enterprises. The methods for possible consultations with China and how to proceed will be determined after the investigation is completed and a report is drafted and taken back to Britain to report to the government. Sir Frederick is a highly influential figure in British economic circles, so his report and insights will represent a portion of the opinions of the British economic community and are worthy of attention. Sir Frederick is scheduled to depart for Britain at the end of January or the beginning of February next year. Minister Kong hosted a dinner for Sir Frederick at his private residence in Gaolemen at 8:00 PM on the 23rd, inviting Presidents Wang Jingwei and Sun Ke, Gu Mengyu, Chen Gongbo, Wang Shijie, Zhu Jiahua, Qin Fen, Xu Mo, Tang Youren, Xu Kan, Zou Lin, Zeng Zhonghai, Chen Bingzhang, and British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen to attend. Sun Ke was unable to attend as he was in Shanghai. President Wang is scheduled to host a banquet for Sir Frederick at the Foreign Affairs Building on the evening of the 24th, inviting British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen, Minister Kong, Xu Mo, Tang Youren, Zou Lin, and others to attend. A reporter visited Sir Frederick at the Mausoleum Garden and was told that his visit was dispatched by the government, and he will stay in Nanjing for about three days. He will visit the relevant authorities and then go to Shanghai to conduct investigations. From Shanghai, he will first go to North China (Tianjin and Beiping), then to Central China (Hankou and Changsha), and then to South China (Guangzhou and Wuzhou). If necessary, he will return to Nanjing and Shanghai before returning to Britain via Hong Kong. Unless there are special circumstances, this itinerary will not change much. The approximate duration of his stay in China will be four months. It is learned that Sir Frederick has left his assistant, Rogers, in Shanghai to organize everything and prepare for the start of the investigation after his return to Shanghai. To facilitate consultation and investigation along the way, China has decided to have representatives from the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Railways, and two representatives from the Economic Council accompany Sir Frederick on his investigation of North, Central, and South China. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Accompanied by British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen and Secretary Chen Bingzhang of Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, Sir Frederick Leith-Ross and his wife arrived in Nanjing at 7:00 AM on the 23rd by special train from Shanghai. Tang Liu, representing President Wang Jingwei; Zeng Zhongfu, representing Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi; Xu Guomao, representing Qin Fen; and British Consul-General Peter Lee welcomed them at the station. After the train stopped, Tang and others boarded the train to meet them. After disembarking, Sir Frederick went to Kong's villa in the Mausoleum Garden New Village to rest. The reporter visited him and was granted an interview. He made the following remarks: "My mission to China is because the British government is paying close attention to the economic situation and financial conditions in China and has sent me to conduct a practical investigation. All steps will be decided after consultation with the British Embassy. I greatly admire and sympathize with China's economic revival and the rapid progress of its construction work. Therefore, within possible limits, the British government will provide economic assistance out of friendship. Regarding Sino-British trade issues, after meeting with Chinese authorities and representatives of British businesses in China, I will strive to improve them. I hope that the two countries will cooperate to achieve good improvements in China's foreign trade." Sir Frederick then stated that he would visit Finance Minister Kong at 11:00 AM on the 23rd for a courtesy call and a brief discussion on China's financial situation.

Kong received him and was accompanied by Zou Lin, Xu Kan, and Qin Fen. Leith-Ross first expressed his admiration for Kong and then thanked him for his hospitality. He briefly described his mission to China. Kong, in addition to wishing him a pleasant journey, expressed his willingness to fully assist in the investigation. Because Leith-Ross was making his first visit after arriving and had not yet investigated China's general economic and financial situation, no specific Sino-British economic issues were discussed during the meeting. Leith-Ross and others stayed at Kong's residence for about an hour before taking their leave.

<h3>Tianjin Authorities Crack Down on Private Economic Organizations</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The North China Economic Relief Association, organized by Tianjin gentry Gao Lingwei and Wang Shuangqi, has virtually dissolved because the Hebei Economic Association was established with the same purpose, and Takeo Takagi, the Deputy General Manager of the Sino-Japanese Industrial Company, has no intention of proceeding with the association. Only the name remains. The East Asia Economic Association, organized by Niu Chuanshan, Chen Dingyuan, Shen Tongwu, and others on Akashi Street in the Japanese Concession of Tianjin, has also stalled because there is nothing to do. Since the issue of North China economy has been loudly advocated, Japanese industrialists have come to Tianjin, Hebei, Chahar, Hebei, Shanxi, and Suiyuan to investigate, paying particular attention to cotton production, textiles, mining, and water conservancy. They are very willing to invest jointly with Chinese people, but because of the estrangement with our merchants and industrialists, many people have taken the opportunity to organize economic organizations to introduce and profit from them. The authorities, fearing unexpected disputes, have ordered the Bureau of Social Affairs to crack down on private organizations. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Pan Yansheng, Bian Shoujing, Niu Huiqing, and others initiated the organization of the East Asia Tonghui Trading Company.

<h3>Gang of Bandits Gathering in Increasing Numbers in Jiaoshan Area</h3>
<p>Linyu County Government Dispatches Troops to Suppress; Bandit Leader Liu Fuming Apprehended</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yuguan News: The gang of bandits entrenched in the Jiaoshan area of Linyu County is now gathering in increasing numbers, engaging in robbery and kidnapping every day. Since the Japanese students of Mantetsu were robbed, the Linyu County government has ordered its subordinates to strictly arrest them. On the 20th of this month, a bandit was captured in Dongjiafen. According to his confession, most of the bandits are scattered in Gaolian Village and other places. Based on the confession, the county government immediately dispatched the Chief Inspector of the Public Security Bureau, along with instructors and long-term police officers and public security teams, to Jiaoshan, Gaolian Village, Erlang Temple Teahouse, and other places to search and suppress them. They engaged in three fierce battles with the bandits, capturing more than twenty bandits. Bandit leader Liu Fuming was also arrested, and the remaining bandits scattered and fled. Many guns were seized. The captured bandits were taken to the county for interrogation. As a result, they confessed to robbing the Japanese students. (23rd Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Central Government and National Government Held Joint Memorial Week Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government and the National Government jointly held the Premier's Memorial Week at 9:00 AM on the 23rd. Ju Zheng, Ye Chucang, Hong Ludong, Li Zonghuang, and Chairman Lin of the National Government, as well as heads of various departments and bureaus Wei Huai, Lu Chao, Chen Qicai, Zhou Zhongliang, Wen Yiyou, Mao Zhongfang, Chen Xunyong, and all staff members of the Party Department, totaling about 600 people, attended. Ye Chucang presided over the meeting, and Ju Zheng reported on the difficulties of innovation and the difficulties of maintaining achievements. He briefly stated that the National Judicial Conference has now closed. All members have conducted thorough research on all proposals. Therefore, although the session was short, the results were excellent. After participating in this meeting, I had one thought, that the true value of the meeting lies in the implementation of the proposals. The proposals themselves must adapt to the times and suit the environment, and those who implement them must have the determination to avoid trouble and not be perfunctory in order to be implemented. The former is the difficulty of establishing a system, and the latter is the difficulty of maintaining achievements. If creation adapts to the needs of the times, then the established system should be good and feasible. Even with good laws and intentions, if the right person is not found, its use is still equal to no system. Our country is now not worried about the lack of innovators, but about the lack of effort in maintaining achievements. If we can make a painstaking effort in maintaining achievements in the future, then all strength will be born from this, and all achievements will be seen from this.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Meaning of Public Opinion</h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>When Song Zheyuan, the Garrison Commander of Peiping and Tianjin, met with journalists after taking office, he expressed four sentiments, one of which was the hope that the press would offer candid criticism. How admirable are these words, how broad-minded a leader! In recent years, morale has been declining and public opinion has been silenced. The criticism of people keeping silent out of fear of those in power is often considered a disgrace. It is indeed due to the complexity of the environment that speaking out is not easy, but the fact that our press has not fulfilled its duty is also something we cannot shirk responsibility for. Song's words are nothing less than a serious encouragement to us.</p>
<p>The responsibility of the press lies in being the voice of the people, seeking communication between superiors and inferiors. In today's complex situation, encountering the evil climate of society, all administrative measures are difficult to implement. Without the wisdom of sages, how can all measures be appropriate? If sight and hearing are not comprehensive, gains and losses will not be clear. Even the wisdom of a thousand thoughts is difficult to avoid a single mistake. The way to correct shortcomings lies in relying on the press's suggestions as a means of correction and prevention. In the positive aspect, it can collect ideas and broaden benefits. In the negative aspect, it can avoid obstruction and barriers, increase the effectiveness of unity, and assist the shortcomings of those in power. This is the meaning of criticism from the press.</p>
<p>The motives for criticism can be out of good intentions or bad intentions. Nitpicking and fault-finding are irrelevant to the overall purpose; this is the kind of bad intention. Discussing the matter based on facts, and setting forth gains and losses, is the kind of good intention. But within good-intentioned criticism, it can be expressed with a tactful attitude or with a confrontational approach. Malicious attacks are beyond the scope of the press. Severe words of advice are often difficult for the recipient to understand. Only sincere and fair contributions are most likely to prompt the party involved to reflect. However, a common problem among Chinese people is that they prefer flattery to honest words. They are self-opinionated and have a lack of clear understanding. Upon hearing criticism, they immediately become angry, thinking that it is either a personal attack or that the critic has ulterior motives. They maintain their own views, disregard the facts, and reject good advice. They do not realize that criticism can be used as a mirror, and its function is the same as medicine. Although the taste may be bitter, it can remove phlegm and disease. In the past, Yu bowed to good words, and Shun was happy to take them and please others. It is better to regard it as the intention of benevolent people than to see it as the means of sages. Only by extensively collecting opinions can one reach a higher level. On the contrary, insisting on narrow-minded views and forcing everyone to agree not only shows narrow-mindedness but also hinders progress. Now, Song openly expresses his willingness to hear criticism, and even wishes to hear frank criticism. His eagerness to pay attention to public opinion shows the precision of his own plans. In addition to feeling ashamed and accepting this responsibility, our press should also consider exerting the greatest effort to cleanse ourselves.</p>

<h3>Japanese General Matsui to Visit China Early Next Month with a Major Mission</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota has long been determined to adjust the overall relationship between China and Japan. When Ambassador Chiang returned to China, he conveyed his opinion that China should adopt a fundamental policy towards Japan and implement formal cooperation. Recently, former Military Councillor General Iwane Matsui is scheduled to visit China, and Foreign Minister Hirota intends to entrust General Matsui with adjusting the policy towards China. That is, General Matsui is scheduled to leave Japan for Shanghai in early next month. Although Matsui himself and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs claim that the purpose of his visit to China is to inspect the situation in China, Matsui is one of the most knowledgeable people in the army about Chinese affairs and has many powerful friends in China. The purpose of his visit to China is quite worthy of attention. It is reported that General Matsui has met with Foreign Minister Hirota repeatedly to exchange views, and his mission seems quite important. (United Press dispatch, 21st)</p>

<h3>Hubei Disaster Relief Joint Meeting Defines Relief Distribution</h3>
<p>(Hankou) The Water Disaster Relief Association, the Provincial Relief Association, and the Charity Relief Association held a joint meeting on the 23rd to define the counties for charity relief distribution. Tianmen and six other counties will each receive 30,000 yuan, and Songzi will receive 10,000 yuan. Counties not receiving charity relief will be given discretionary relief by the Water Disaster Relief Association to achieve effective division of labor and cooperation. Chiang ordered the Hubei Provincial Government that, because the disaster in western Hubei is severe and local despots are rampant, it should allocate funds for work relief on the one hand and eliminate corrupt local despots on the other to save the disaster victims and stabilize the local area. The Provincial Government previously submitted a request to the Hankou Provisional Headquarters to increase the surtax on special goods for disaster relief, but the Headquarters has now ordered that it be disallowed.

<h3>Disaster Relief Reserve Fund Management Committee Held Meeting Yesterday, Xu Shiying Plans to Implement Agricultural Relief</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The second meeting of the Shenyang Central Disaster Relief Reserve Fund Management Committee was held on the 23rd, chaired by Xu Shiying. He reported on the organization of the disaster relief reserve fund management committees in various provinces and the allocation of the total amount of the central disaster relief reserve fund. Then, the meeting discussed the amount to be listed in the national budget for the 25th fiscal year regarding the central disaster relief reserve fund. After detailed discussion, no concrete decision was made. It needs to be discussed with the Ministry of Finance before a decision can be made. It is understood that the disaster relief reserve fund for this year was initially listed at 2 million yuan by the Central Political Council. Due to the flooding in various provinces along the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers this year, one-half of it was legally used for disaster relief. In addition to the 90,000 yuan first allocated by the Ministry of Finance, the association actually received 910,000 yuan, which was transferred to the Relief Association for distribution and relief in one lump sum. Now that the national budget for the 25th fiscal year is about to begin, the disaster relief reserve fund item should be legally listed. According to Article 10 of the Disaster Relief Reserve Fund Law, the association should prepare a budget and submit it to the supervisory authority. However, the total amount of national recurring revenue for the 25th fiscal year cannot be predicted, so it is impossible to prepare the budget according to 1% of it. It is said that the association will submit a request to the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Finance to inform the association of the total amount of national recurring budget revenue as soon as possible, and then discuss and prepare the budget according to the proportion.

<h3>Civil Servants Donate Salaries to Help Disaster Relief, Kong Plans to Implement Measures</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance believes that the salary donations of central civil servants for disaster relief, as previously decided by the central government, should be collected as soon as possible. Therefore, it has prepared implementation measures for collecting donations, which Kong Xiangxi submitted to the Executive Yuan for discussion at this week's Executive Yuan meeting. It is said that the source of funds for various central agencies is originally divided into three types: (1) those directly paid by the Ministry of Finance, (2) those allocated by revenue agencies, and (3) those directly paid from the agency's own revenue. In Kong's proposal, regarding the collection of this salary donation, regardless of the source of funds for the agency, it is proposed that the national treasury manage it to unify and benefit disaster relief. It is said that the total amount of this salary donation should be at least over one million yuan. (Central News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<h3>Britain and Italy Mutually Assure Each Other, No Hostility in Naval Activities</h3>
<p>Easing of Tensions in Europe, Italian Prime Minister Raises Four Minimum Demands as Conditions for Solving East African Problem</p>
<p>(London) Britain has sought to ease tensions between Britain and Italy. The Foreign Office issued a statement today stating that Britain has no intention of attacking Italy, and detailing the mutual assurances exchanged between British Ambassador to Italy Drummond and Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Suvich in Rome. Ambassador Drummond stated that the movements and reinforcements of the British fleet to defend the Mediterranean were "a natural result of the recent fierce attacks on Britain by the Italian press." It is believed here that this statement by the Foreign Office is intended to make it easier for Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to adopt a more compromising attitude. As for Geneva, Mussolini's demands seem to be coming on strong, but the atmosphere has suddenly turned optimistic with the presentation of minimum conditions for abandoning war. The conditions proposed by Mussolini include the following three: (1) Italian Eritrea and Somalia must obtain territorial connections, with Abyssinia ceding a western region to Italy; (2) any sea route for Abyssinia must pass through a port in Italian territory; (3) the majority of the Abyssinian army must be dismissed and disarmed, with the remaining army under the control of Italian generals. It is understood that the League of Nations representatives are now following Britain's lead, and most do not believe that Britain can allow the expansion of the scope of the Five-Power Committee's recommendations, and expect that the League of Nations itself cannot accept these conditions, because accepting them would be tantamount to infringing on Abyssinia's sovereignty. (National News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) British morning newspapers believe that the wording of the Italian government's announcement rejecting the Five-Member Special Committee's recommendations and its criticisms of the solution are a sign of improving situation. According to the Daily Telegraph, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's minimum demands include the following four: (1) The area of land ceded to Italy must be more than that recommended; (2) Abyssinia's outlet to the sea must pass through Eritrea; (3) the Abyssinian army must be disarmed and reorganized by Italy; (4) sufficient land must be ceded to Italy so that Eritrea can be connected to Italian Somaliland. The Daily Telegraph advocates a policy of patience towards Italy, saying that the strong attitude taken by the League of Nations Council and the General Assembly has had a clear and powerful impression in Rome, and the concentration of the British Navy in the Mediterranean has made this impression even more profound. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) Since Britain concentrated its navy in the Mediterranean, relations between Britain and Italy have been extremely tense. However, since Britain stated that its naval actions were unrelated to sanctions, people here have felt relieved, and the fear that the Italian-Abyssinian conflict could trigger a European war has also dissipated. At the same time, diplomatic negotiations between Britain, France, and Italy have resumed. If the League of Nations cannot resolve the difficult situation, it is hoped here that Britain, France, and Italy will hold another tripartite conference, at which Mussolini may personally attend. The attitude of the newspapers towards Britain is now becoming more moderate, and they are able to make more objective criticisms of the Five-Member Committee's recommendations.

<h3>Special Committee Meeting Yesterday After Receiving Italian and Abyssinian Replies</h3>
<p>Recognizing Mediation Has Failed, Drafting Report to Submit to Executive Council</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Five-Power Committee met this morning and decided to continue deliberations tomorrow to draft a report to the League of Nations Executive Council on the failure of the Committee's mediation. According to political sources, the Committee believes that the reply from Mussolini delivered by Italian representative Aloisi cannot be accepted. According to Mussolini's demands, (1) Abyssinia must cede a strip of land so that Italian Eritrea and Somalia can be connected, and cede some land east of the Abyssinian capital to Italy; (2) in compensation for Abyssinia's territorial cession, Italy will provide a port in an Italian colony; (3) Abyssinia must completely disarm; (4) the police necessary for maintaining order must be controlled by Italy. (National News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Italy firmly demands that land adjacent to Eritrea must be ceded to Italy and that Italy be granted a kind of jurisdiction over Abyssinia proper. The Italian-Abyssinian dispute is now gradually approaching a breaking point. It is generally believed that the situation is almost hopeless, and Italy may withdraw from the League of Nations. People here are now pessimistic, fearing that the Italian and Abyssinian views can never be reconciled. Italy's attitude against the proposals of the Five-Member Special Committee remains unchanged. According to today's news, Abyssinia has accepted the proposals of the Five-Member Special Committee, but with the proviso that its sovereignty must be preserved, the details of which are still to be discussed. French Prime Minister Laval arrived here from Paris this morning and immediately met with Italian representative Aloisi and Special Committee Chairman Madariaga. The Five-Member Special Committee meeting was held at 11 am, and it is said that Aloisi presented the Committee with Italy's formal response to the Committee's proposals. The meeting time was very short, only a few minutes, and then a public announcement was issued, stating that the Five-Member Special Committee met this morning to record Abyssinia's reply agreeing to the Committee's recommendations and to study Italy's reply with attached opinions. The Committee decided to report to the League of Nations Executive Council the general situation that can be seen from the official documents, etc. Chairman Madariaga will meet with representatives from both Italy and Abyssinia in the afternoon, and the Committee will hold another meeting tomorrow to draft a report to the League of Nations Executive Council, stating the course of the failed mediation. It is said that the Committee will study the articles of Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant at tomorrow's meeting to serve as the basis for the League of Nations' future actions. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Secretariat has just issued a bulletin stating that the Italian-Abyssinian Dispute Subcommittee held a meeting this morning to discuss Abyssinia's reply accepting the Committee's recommendations and the Italian government's answer, and decided to submit a report to the Executive Council to explain the situation. It is generally believed that the Committee decided to submit a report to the Executive Council because the replies from both Italy and Abyssinia have been received, and because the interests involved in the current dispute are extremely important, it is necessary to seek instructions from the Executive Council. French Prime Minister Laval met with Italian representative Aloisi before the Committee meeting, and British Minister of State Eden also discussed with Committee Chairman Madariaga. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Executive Council's Italian-Abyssinian Dispute Subcommittee is scheduled to hold a meeting tomorrow and prepare a report to be sent to the Executive Council. This report will include all relevant documents relating to the various negotiations conducted by the Committee since its establishment. It is generally expected that the Executive Council will hold a meeting tomorrow afternoon or the day after to discuss this report. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Observers believe that after Italy and Abyssinia responded to the Subcommittee, the situation of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute has reached its peak. Since the Abyssinian government has expressed its acceptance of the peace plan proposed by the Committee, Italy should be legally bound by Article 15, Paragraph 6 of the League of Nations Covenant and may not arbitrarily declare war on the country. However, judging from the demands made by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini yesterday, which almost amount to placing Abyssinia under Italian administration, they cannot be accepted by the League of Nations. On the British delegation's side, it is believed that the proposals made by the Subcommittee should be considered the maximum extent possible and that there is no possibility of further progress. This is because the recommendations can be said to have satisfied the requirements proposed by Italy. The Committee's advocacy of reorganizing the Abyssinian economic institutions is precisely to meet Italy's wishes. In addition, if this recommendation is submitted to the Executive Council for instructions, the Executive Council may not necessarily agree due to its own qualifications. Therefore, what Italy can obtain should be less than the Subcommittee's recommendations. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Italian Spokesperson Says Door to Reconciliation Not Closed, Awaiting New Proposals from League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Rome) An authoritative spokesperson told a Reuters interviewer today that the door to reconciliation of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute remains open. Italy is currently awaiting new proposals from the League of Nations, and the minimum basis for discussion not included in the recent proposals of the Five-Power Committee may be seen in the new proposals. Italy has not submitted an answer. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) It is claimed here that Italy will not withdraw from the League of Nations for the time being, and will only consider this when it is forced to do so. Italy's attitude, though not harmonious, is quite proper. It is noteworthy that the newspapers here have not recently advocated that Italy should withdraw from the League of Nations. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) Foreign observers believe that the Italian people are currently calmly spending their daily lives, waiting for the development of the international situation regarding the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. There is no atmosphere of the eve of a great war here. The newspapers commented on the proposals of the League of Nations Executive Council Subcommittee, generally believing that although the Committee has recognized the necessity of reorganizing Abyssinian institutions, the proposed plan is limited to reorganizing the administrative institutions. However, if the reorganization of the administration does not have a solid foundation, in other words, if the entire Abyssinian nation is not thoroughly transformed, it is unlikely to succeed. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>The Inside Story of Britain's Opposition to Italy's Use of Force in East Africa</h3>
<p>Treating the Far East Route as a Lifeline, Not Upholding Justice for Small Nations</p>
<p>(New York) According to informed sources here, the real reason why Britain opposes Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's use of force against Abyssinia is not to protect justice for this small African country. The world generally believes that Europe is unlikely to have a war within ten years, but the current situation has changed. The British believe that Italy's current actions against Abyssinia are the vanguard of a colonial policy. If it succeeds, the status of all colonies in Africa will be threatened by Italy. If Britain's hegemony in the Mediterranean, Africa, and the Red Sea is seized by others, the foundation of the British Empire will shake, because the route from the Strait of Gibraltar through the Suez Canal, the Red Sea, to India, the Far East, Australia, and New Zealand is the lifeline of British commerce. The British people are firmly opposed to war, but defending their empire is another matter. Therefore, the British monarch can, in these times, transform from a passive position to become the leader of millions of loyal citizens of the country. If the cabinet decides that war is inevitable, the British monarch, although peace-loving, will also support its decision, and the entire nation will rise up to support the British monarch. Moreover, if Britain and Italy go to war, other countries will also be drawn into the vortex, because Britain and France are natural allies and have always jointly supported the League of Nations. France also has many allies on the continent. On the other hand, Italy is not isolated either. (National News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>British and Italian Navies Deploy in the Mediterranean</h3>
<p>Mutual Assurance of Non-Aggression; British Ambassador Visits Mussolini</p>
<p>(London) The British and Italian governments have mutually assured each other that their naval activities in the Mediterranean are not for aggressive purposes. According to an official statement released by the British Foreign Office, on September 20th, the British Ambassador to Rome, Sir Eric Drummond, met with the Italian Undersecretary of State, Suvich, to inform him on behalf of the British government about the movements of the British fleet in the Mediterranean and the reinforcement of garrisons and war materials. He also stated that these British actions did not contain any intention of aggression and were solely a response to the anti-British campaign in the Italian press in recent weeks. Suvich replied that he was instructed to declare that Italy's military preparations in the Mediterranean were purely defensive and not intended for aggression. It is reported that Sir Eric Drummond's notification to the Italian government was not prompted by any formal protest from Rome but was initiated by the British government itself. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) The purpose of the British Foreign Office's publication of the above communiqué is to alleviate the tension of the current situation, or perhaps to indicate that a conflict between Britain and Italy is not a real issue. Regarding this, officials have repeatedly stated that the British naval precautions have two objectives: first, to prepare Britain so that it can implement the provisions of the League of Nations Covenant once the League Council makes a decision; and second, to protect Britain's own interests in the event of an emergency. However, regardless of how circumstances change, Britain must consider the decisions of the League Council as a guide. As for the communiqué issued by the Italian Cabinet yesterday, officials have not commented on it, saying only that there is still hope for continued negotiations in Geneva. In short, officials hold an optimistic view of the situation and believe that the communiqué issued by the Foreign Office tonight should further smooth the way forward. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) The British Ambassador to Italy, Sir Eric Drummond, has recently received instructions from the government to meet with Italian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mussolini for talks. This move will have a significant impact on the development of the current situation. Since the recent dispute arose, Ambassador Drummond has only been in contact with Italian Undersecretary of State Suvich. Now that he is meeting with Prime Minister Mussolini, it will not be difficult to discern from their conversation whether Italy is seeking a political compromise on Abyssinia and whether the tense relationship between Britain and Italy can be eased.

<h3>Italian Troops Continue to Deploy to East Africa</h3>
<p>Naples: Italy is still sending troops to Africa. Last week, five transport ships, carrying over 6,000 soldiers and equipped with heavy vehicles, mules, artillery, and other war materials, departed for Africa. Among the officers was Captain Gillen, who is already sixty years old and participated in the Battle of Adowa (in which the Ethiopian army defeated the Italian army). He has volunteered to serve again. This week, another 3,000 people will depart for Africa. At the same time, troops from various parts of Italy continue to arrive here in a steady stream. The Governor of Rome, Bottai, is also one of the recent volunteers. He was received by Mussolini yesterday and will resign his post on the 28th to go on expedition. The Italian writer Gayda has also written an article published in a newspaper, saying that the plan formulated by the Committee of Five in Geneva does not involve the Abyssinian army. The Abyssinian army cannot be compared to the armies of other countries. Therefore, the Committee has not taken into account Italy's security. The tone of the article is much milder than his previous writings. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Initiator of the Kellogg-Briand Pact Resigns from Post as President of the Hague Court Due to Circumstances Preventing Attendance</h3>

<h3>Current Status of the French Navy: Two Battleships Under Construction</h3>
<p>(Paris) At a time when the world is paying attention to the military strength of various countries, a statement by Naval Minister Pietri to a reporter from "Le Journal" regarding the current state of the French Navy has attracted great attention. Pietri said that since the European War, no country has made as much effort to restore its navy as France. To date, France has a total of 426,000 tons of naval vessels available for deployment. This does not include the two 35,000-ton warships approved by the National Assembly. However, this is not an expansion of armaments. The tonnage of the French fleet is still one-third less than in 1914, as 140,000 tons were lost during the Great War, and efforts were not made to make up for the shortfall after 1915. Pietri also said that the main task at present is to build battleships, as France only has six old-style armored ships and three other old ships. However, this shortfall can be made up once the "Dunkerque," the "Strasbourg," and two other 35,000-ton ships are built. The construction of two 32,000-ton ships was approved at the beginning of this year. (National Press, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Reorganizes Army, Modeling After French Military System</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Central Executive Committee and the People's Committee of Soviet Russia have issued three orders to reorganize the Red Army, modeling it after the French military system. At the same time, a Red Army General Staff is being established, and the highest rank for officers is General, awarded exclusively to talented and outstanding officers and soldiers. Political circles explain that this new legislation means that the theory of equality has been abolished even in the Red Army. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Moscow) People's Commissar for Defence of the Soviet Union, Voroshilov, issued the following instructions regarding the recent Red Army exercises in the Kiev Military District: "The Soviet Red Army of the Kiev Military District reflects the victorious development of various constructions and demonstrates the tremendous success of its various military trainings. The political and mental level of the troops participating in the exercises is extremely high." Voroshilov also stated that this war exercise extensively applied the latest military technical equipment and demonstrated the complete nature of modern warfare. He also pointed out that a large number of personnel jumping from airplanes, their organization, technology, and skills were outstanding, and their military actions during and after landing were also commendable. In his order, Voroshilov expressed his gratitude to the Commander of the Kiev Military District, his deputies, and all personnel participating in the exercises and ordered that the names of personnel with outstanding performance be submitted for recognition and reward. (TASS, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Central Executive Committee and the People's Committee promulgated an order to define the ranks of Red Army generals and stipulate the regulations for generals' service. It stated that the socialist construction in recent years has been largely victorious, and the Red Army has undergone long-term improvements in organization and technology, thus transforming into an advanced and first-class army. It possesses the latest military technology, and its command cadres are cultivated by the Communist Party, making them the most valuable asset. The Party has a slogan: "Cadres decide everything." This slogan, when applied to the Red Army, creates various conditions to ensure the continued growth and completion of the Red Army's cadres and commanders. Red Army commanders, such as commanders and political workers, are increasingly becoming lifelong careers. This career has its own characteristics, so service in this role must be clearly defined by law. All commanders must bear a special responsibility, namely, to train and cultivate Red Army talent. Commanders have a guiding role on the battlefield, so various ranks must be clearly defined. Then, each individual's military and special qualifications, past experiences, and their power and position in the Red Army can be clearly expressed.</p>
<p>"The Soviet Central Executive Committee and the People's Committee have decided that the Red Army commanders should be divided into the following command and special military ranks: Land and Air Force commanders are divided into Lieutenant, Captain, Major, Lieutenant Colonel, Colonel, Brigade Commander, Division Commander, Corps Commander, First-Class Army Commander, and Second-Class Army Commander. In the Navy, they are divided into Lieutenant, Captain Lieutenant, Captain, Lieutenant Commander, First-Class Captain, Second-Class Captain, First-Class Flag Officer, and Second-Class Flag Officer. Other troops will implement new ranks. In addition, a 'Soviet General' rank will be established, exclusively awarded by the Soviet Central Executive Committee to the highest-ranking officers with outstanding merits." The above resolution instructs to review all commanders and assign them ranks separately. Another directive from the Soviet People's Committee will rename the Red Army Staff Department as the Red Army General Staff. (TASS, 23rd)</p>
<h3>US Army Chief of Staff Proposes Five-Year Military Expansion Plan</h3>
<p>Add 800 Aircraft Annually; Army Strives for Motorization</p>
<p>(Washington) US Army Chief of Staff General MacArthur submitted his annual report to President Roosevelt today, advocating that 800 aircraft should be added annually over the next five years. MacArthur was recently appointed by Roosevelt as a military advisor to the Philippine Commonwealth government. This major proposal to expand the air force can be seen as his farewell gift to the US Army. MacArthur's report also stated that the Army, now that Congress is no longer obstructing, has entered a fiscal year of developing into a sufficient defense force and adapting to the minimum needs of the country, for the first time since 1922. MacArthur also outlined his five-year plan for the Army in the report as follows: (1) Replace all livestock-based operations with motorization; (2) Equip every infantryman with a new semi-automatic rifle, followed by the guards; (3) Modernize all field artillery; (4) Equip each army with anti-aircraft artillery; (5) Continue to experiment with chemical warfare tactics; (6) Gradually accumulate munitions.

<h3>Italy's Wartime Economic Resources; Solely Depend on Raising Bonds</h3>
<p>(London) The "Financial News" published an article on Italy's economic resources in wartime, stating that "If a war breaks out, it goes without saying that the supply of various raw materials needed by the Italian army will face various difficulties due to economic sanctions. In addition, if the war lasts for several months, the gold reserves of the Italian National Bank will also be quickly exhausted. From this, it can be seen that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini intends for the war to end in a short period, even if a war breaks out. If so, although Italy's financial situation is quite depleted, it should not be difficult to raise public bonds domestically to finance military expenses. From past experience, countries can often rely on raising domestic debt to overcome difficulties during wartime and prevent financial bankruptcy. Although Italy has increased its domestic debt by a huge amount in recent years while peaceful, it can still be supported. Now, if a war breaks out, even if the domestic debt increases to an alarming amount, technically, it should not exceed the possible range." (Havas, 23rd)</p>

<h3>Shandong Branch of the Chinese Cultural Construction Association Opposes Land Collectivization</h3>
<p>Yan's Claims Violate Party Guidelines; Suggest Central Government Refrain From Discussion</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Yan Xishan, the Pacification Commissioner of Shanxi, advocated for land collectivization, which has attracted much attention from the people of the country. Today (the 21st), the Shandong branch of the Chinese Cultural Construction Association held its third cadre meeting at the Department of Education. Cadre Li Tianni proposed an impromptu motion, stating that Yan Xishan's recently published advocacy of land collectivization is greatly contrary to the Three Principles of the People of the Premier [Sun Yat-sen]. He requested that the branch thoroughly study the matter, formulate a suggestion, and submit it to the general association, which would then forward it to the Fifth National Congress to suggest that this proposal not be discussed. He also entrusted Branch Director He to suggest, when attending the Fifth National Congress, that the proposal not be discussed. Cadre Wu Zicheng spoke, elaborating on and supplementing Li's proposal, asserting that Yan Xishan's advocacy is tantamount to opposing the Party and should be corrected. Chairman He Siyuan put it to discussion. Many cadres spoke, all agreeing that the Party's Principle of People's Livelihood already has clear regulations regarding restricting capital and equalizing land ownership. Yan Xishan, as a member of the Central Committee, should naturally be aware of this. Yet, he now has such an advocacy that violates the Party's political guidelines. Some who do not know the inside story even express sympathy with him. If it is turned over to the association for study, what is the difference between that land collectivization method and that of the Communist Party? Moreover, with land collectivization, the number of people in this village and that village is different, and the amount of land is also different. Disputes between villages will inevitably arise. This method is fundamentally unworkable and will only increase national disputes. At this time of multiple national crises, this heresy should be corrected, and so on. The chairman put it to a vote, and it was unanimously passed. It was resolved that Li Tianni and Liu Daoyuan would draft the document and submit it to the general association, which would then forward it to the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee and the Fifth National Congress. The meeting then adjourned.</p>

<p>British Wheat: The Liverpool wheat market is still controlled by the international situation. Today's price fell because of news of rain in Argentina and reports of favorable private wheat harvests for deficiency parties. At 1 PM, the October price was 6 shillings and 6 pence, down 625.</p>
<p>American Wheat: The Chicago wheat market opened weak following overseas market conditions and then fell slightly due to estimates of private wheat production in Argentina, which were favorable for the deficiency parties.

<h3>Xiamen: Significant Tax Evasion on Sugar</h3>
<p>Smugglers Are Organized and Armed; Customs Authorities Are Unable to Investigate</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: In Xiamen, due to special circumstances, there are many operators who evade customs duties. Although customs authorities are making every effort to investigate and suppress them, these operators are organized, have backgrounds, and are a large-scale and well-funded group that has wide connections and unpredictable tactics. Although news of customs seizing smuggled goods is heard daily, only one out of ten is caught, and the losses are extremely minimal. Taking洋 sugar alone, Xiamen consumes at least 2,000 bags of sugar per month. However, according to customs statistics, from January 1st to September 19th of this year, only 4,969 bags of sugar were imported. These 4,969 bags of sugar were mostly transported to the Zhangzhou area for sale after import. In reality, not a single bag was imported into the city itself. Given that the city needs 2,000 bags of sugar per month and there is no local sugar production, it is all smuggled洋 sugar. This is an open secret in Xiamen, and people generally say, "Xiamen white sugar has no tax." According to reliable investigations, smuggled sugar arrives in Xiamen mostly from Qingyu and Gangwei outside Xiamen Port. It comes from the other side mostly loaded on large sailing ships or fishing boats. After reaching the destination, it is successively transported out using fishing boats, small sailing boats, and large double-oared boats. The transportation is disciplined, step-by-step, and has security. For example, when transporting by sailing ship or fishing boat, the one carrying the most cargo occupies a safe position and is supported by three other ships carrying less cargo. If they encounter a customs anti-smuggling ship, they will first use a ship with less cargo to deliberately create a panicked escape, attracting the attention of the customs ship. The other two ships will provide remote support. Even if one or two ships are caught, the loss is minimal. The heavily loaded ship has already landed on the other shore during this chaos. There must be bodyguards on this fully loaded ship, ranging from twenty to more than ten, all of whom are armed thugs. Whenever customs ships pursue these heavily loaded ships, they will inevitably open fire in resistance. The other three ships will also surround the customs ships. When customs ships encounter this, in the difficult situation of having to respond to the enemy, the fully loaded ship will set sail and fly away. The loading and unloading locations are Heshan, Wutong, and Fan Jiao on the Xiamen shore. This is in terms of Xiamen. In Quanzhou, it is on the coast outside Dongshi Port Nanmen. It is even more difficult for customs ships to fully investigate. In the Zhangzhou area, the situation was not as severe as in Xiamen and Quanzhou. The only income from sugar tax comes from this line. Recently, smuggled goods have also been pouring in from the seaport. Zhangpu has even more large-scale organizations, transporting and selling goods by car from Funan Bridge. Therefore, in August, Xiamen Customs transported 1,000 bags of sugar to the Zhangzhou area. This month, from the 1st to the 19th, there were only 100 bags in two weeks. These two places have become the main channels for the import of smuggled sugar into the Zhangzhou area.

<p>Strictly Preventing Dishonest Merchants from Roundabout Export; Transportation of Silver Within the Province Requires a License</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since Guangdong Province banned the export of silver, the large-scale export of silver dollars has virtually disappeared. However, since Guangdong Province is located near the ocean, there are still a few dishonest merchants who transport silver dollars into inland ports under the pretext of entering the mainland, and then转运 them overseas in order to conceal their activities from the outside world. The authorities have already formulated measures for the transportation of silver within the country, stipulating that transportation is only permitted if the local port chamber of commerce issues a license. However, difficulties sometimes arise due to procedural issues. Recently, the Guangdong Department of Finance, in order to cope with this situation, specially formulated measures for the transportation of silver coins within the province and the procedures for obtaining licenses, which were approved by the Southwest Political Affairs Committee and circulated to the Guangdong Customs and Shantou and Hainan Customs for compliance. The measures are as follows: (1) If merchants in this province transport毛洋 coins or big dollar coins within the province to areas where毛洋 coins or big dollar coins have always been in circulation, the ships carrying them must pass through the ocean outside of the province and then re-enter the province, or if the transportation destination is on the national border, they can leave the country immediately after arrival. If transporters may export them overseas by way of circumventing the law, in addition to being allowed to carry a limited amount of ten yuan in accordance with the 銀禁条例, carrying anything more will be handled in accordance with the supplementary measures to crackdown on the smuggling of hard currency from the mainland via roundabout routes, and the provisions of these regulations. (2) These regulations do not apply to the transportation of silver coins within the province that does not involve the circumstances mentioned in the preceding paragraph. (3) For the transportation of silver coins within the province, if the circumstances mentioned in the preceding paragraph exist, a reputable firm with a business license must be found in Guangzhou to provide a guarantee in accordance with the supplementary measures, and the Department of Finance will specify the number of silver coins that are permitted to be transported and issue a transportation license. If the Department of Finance entrusts the Customs Supervisory Office or a Customs branch to issue transportation licenses on its behalf, the local procedures will continue to be followed. (4) When declaring imports and exports, the license must be presented to the customs for verification. After the customs have completed the verification, the date of verification and release must be written on the license and stamped with a seal before it is released. After the goods have been transported to the destination, the merchant must submit the license to the original issuing agency for cancellation within the prescribed time limit. (5) Whether exporting or importing silver coins, merchants must be limited to locations where customs offices are established. Whether the silver coins are transported by ferry, they must be listed on the ferry's manifest and declared to customs for verification. (6) Regardless of which agency issues the transportation license, the Department of Finance may at any time secretly order officials of the relevant local agency to investigate whether a merchant has transported silver coins to that location and sold them abroad to profit from smuggling. If such circumstances exist, even if the original license has been canceled, the guarantor firm and the declaring merchant cannot be relieved of their responsibility. (7) Wuzhou is an inland commercial port outside this province, but the commercial relationship between this province and Wuzhou is close. These regulations specifically treat Wuzhou as the same as inland areas of this province. However, since the commercial relationship between Wuzhou and Guangzhou is in a position of import excess over exports, if a merchant transports silver from Guangzhou to Wuzhou, the reason for the need to transport silver should be reported in detail to the Department for approval before a license can be issued.

<h3>Completion of Huainan Railway</h3>
<p>Planning to Build Yuxikou Terminal Station; Joint Operations with Jiangnan Railway</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The Huainan Railway, built by the Huainan Coal Mining Bureau, starts from Tianjia'an, the location of the coal mine, and passes through Datong, Huaian, Shuijiahu, Zhuxiang, Xiatangji, Luoji, Shuangdunji, Hefei, Cuozhen, Qiaotouji, Jiongjiang River, Zhonggan, and finally Yuxikou on the opposite bank of Wuhu, with a total length of more than 180 kilometers. Since construction began, the project has progressed rapidly. The section from Tianjia'an to the county seat of Chaoxian was completed and opened to traffic at the end of last month, transporting coal and attaching fourth-class passenger cars. It has been operating for two weeks, and business is quite prosperous. As for the section from Chaoxian to Yuxikou on the opposite bank of Wuhu, the final destination, it is about 60 kilometers long. The earthwork for the roadbed has now been completely built. However, because there are more than 30 bridges, the project is more difficult and will take longer. As soon as it is completed within the deadline, track laying will begin. Yesterday, a person in charge of the road came to Wuhu from the mine to discuss matters with the Wuhu Jiangnan Railway Company. According to the conversation, Yuxi is the terminal station of the road and must operate jointly with the Wuhu Jiangnan Railway. Regarding the station foundation earthwork, the land has now been purchased and the construction is being planned. It is expected that all projects will be completed by the end of this year, and the entire line will begin operation. Passenger cars will be added in early March of next year to officially transport passengers. In order to facilitate the travel of merchants, joint operations will be carried out with the Jiangnan Railway. Wuhu to Yuxikou is a total of 25 Chinese miles. It is planned to purchase ferries to transport trains, similar to the Shanghai-Pinghu traffic plan, which can arrive in just half an hour. He went on to say that this light railway is extremely economical to build, costing less than other roads. After completion in the future, the transportation of Huainan coal will be convenient, and its sales will definitely be prosperous. Currently, coal from the mine is being transported to Chaoxian and then loaded onto civilian boats and towed to Wuhu by small轮ships for sale to various places upstream and downstream. In addition, according to Zhou Xiansong, the manager of the Jiangnan Railway Company, the surveying project for the expansion of the line from Sunjiabu has now reached the Hulesi Town area of Ningguo County. As soon as funds are raised, construction will begin. After reaching Tunxi in the future, Huangshan will inevitably become more prosperous. As for the Wuhu-Sunjiabu line, business has recently become increasingly prosperous. In order to facilitate the travel of passengers, after the newly purchased locomotives are transported to Wuhu, the number of trains will be increased from three to four per day, for a total of eight round trips.

<p>Jinshan: Jinshan Citizens Petition for Correction of Superintendent Yi's Inspection Report</p>
<p>Yi Zuolin, a superintendent of schools in Jiangsu Province, has a long-standing reputation for inspecting the education in various counties. However, people in various places have always regretted that Mr. Yi is too subjective, making more negative criticisms and less positive guidance. At the beginning of this semester, the Songjiang Seven County Women's Normal School suddenly announced its closure, and the Jinshan Qin Ming and Ren Cun Senior Elementary Schools were also abruptly abolished. Students have suffered from losing their schooling, and those with knowledge are all crying for the future of education. It is now known that Jinshan citizens Xuan You, Fang Chongzhi, Gong Bing, Bai Jiao, Chen Duanzhi, Zhang Xiaoshen, Yang Daohong, Yu Zhicheng, and others in Shanghai will jointly petition the province to correct this.</p>

<p>Jinshan Zhangyan Qin Ming Elementary School was founded more than 30 years ago by Yao Shizi, Gao Dunjian, He Xianchen, and others, giants of the Nanshe Society, and has achieved considerable results. However, at the beginning of this semester, the province suddenly ordered that the senior classes be abolished because the school buildings were narrow and the students were crowded. Local people were shocked upon hearing the news, saying that if the school buildings are narrow, they should find ways to add to them. Moreover, there is another senior school in the same place, but there is no vacant land to accommodate them. The provincial order ignores the facts and is tantamount to harming education. Therefore, after deliberation, they are petitioning the province to make every effort to preserve the school and are temporarily maintaining it with local funds.</p>
<p>Suzhou: Various Counties Plan to Build New Prisons</p>

<p>Changzhou: Rickshaw Dispute Still Needs Reconsideration</p>
<p>The dispute between rickshaw owners and rickshaw drivers in Wujin County has lasted for a long time and has not yet been resolved in a fair manner. On the afternoon of the 16th of this month, Public Security Bureau Chief Xu Baoguang and First District Chief Lin Jun met with representatives of both labor and capital from the rickshaw industry to discuss a solution to the rent issue. As a result, the capital party must ensure that the rickshaw body and all equipment are in perfect condition and must be inspected by the county government on a regular basis. The rent should still be calculated at 30 cents of silver dollar in accordance with the order from the Province. Both parties unanimously agreed on the spot, and Bureau Chief Xu and District Chief Lin reported to the county government for approval. Subsequently, some rickshaw drivers rose up and declared that they had not sent representatives to participate in the discussions, denied the agreement, and jointly petitioned the county party headquarters for assistance. Currently, the county party headquarters, in order to avoid disputes, strongly advocates that both management and labor should adhere to the principle of coexistence and co-prosperity in order to seek a balanced solution. On the 22nd, a letter was sent to the county government convening a party-government talk session for reconsideration.</p>
<p>Yangzhou: Investigating Police Who Aided a Fugitive, Punishing the County Seriously by Telegram</p>
<p>Zhou Wenliang, a lawyer from Taixian, was previously involved in a case in which he colluded with Zhou Yingjie to falsely accuse Wan Jiming of selling poisonous pills. The Zhenjiang Garrison Command investigated, tried, and sentenced him to be escorted to Taixian, where he was released on bail and detained separately. When he arrived in Taixian, the two escorting policemen Jiang Zhaoxin and Gao Jinbiao actually took Zhou Wenliang and others to the Zhou criminal's private residence for dinner. The Zhou criminal claimed to enter the room for a conversation and then escaped. By the time it was discovered, he could not be found. The Taixian county government temporarily detained the escorting Gao Jinbiao and Jiang Zhaoxin. It is now known that after the County Government received the news, it immediately sent a telegram to Taixian County Head Zhang, asking him to shackle the two policemen Jiang Zhaoxin and Gao Jinbiao with double shackles, strictly interrogate them to see if there were any other circumstances, and severely punish them according to law. He also asked them to order his subordinates to arrest the Zhou Wenliang and bring him to justice, and to give each of the team leader Liu Zonghan and the detective Hu Keyin of the Criminal Investigation Team of the County Public Security Bureau a major demerit for improper use of personnel in order to show punishment.</p>

<p>Pinghu: More than 40 Loads of Smuggled Salt Seized</p>
<p>At noon on the 21st, a large cargo ship full of charcoal baskets was passing through the Hongqiao in the urban area when a salt policeman happened to pass by. Seeing that the ship's load was very heavy, he was suspicious and ordered the ship to stop for inspection. The people in the boat fled in all directions by jumping into the water. The police boarded the ship, dismantled the baskets, and found smuggled salt, totaling more than 40 loads. They then escorted the ship to the salt public hall to report their功績.</p>
<p>Hangzhou: Jiangpu Highway Transportation Strike</p>
<p>The Jiang (Shan) Pu (Cheng) highway on the border of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces has always relied heavily on the transportation of goods from Fujian province, with annual revenues of approximately 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. Recently, the Fujian Provincial Government, in order to improve the Yanpu, Yansha Yong, and Jianshao Guang highway projects, has specially allocated highway stock bonds based on the volume of exported goods: 10 cents per case of kerosene, 5.5 cents per case of soap, 2.5 yuan per 100 kilograms of native cloth, and the same for yarn, wool, cotton textiles, and leather products. A general office has been established in Pucheng to begin allocating the bonds. Merchants believe that the burden is equivalent to doubling the freight rate and have all gone on strike to show their resistance. It has been a week and has not yet been resolved. Chen Ticheng, the director of the Fujian Construction Department, came to Hangzhou yesterday to visit Zhu Yaoting, the director of the Highway Bureau, to discuss the matter.</p>

Fortunately, after the summer, the rainfall was well-distributed, and the growth was quite lush. Unexpectedly, after the autumn equinox, the rain continued, coupled with the intense heat, most of the cotton bolls that had formed rotted, and those that had not formed were lost. The rice ears were just at the time of grain formation when they were suddenly devastated by wind and rain, drooping and collapsing, mostly showing white ears. In addition, with continuous flooding for days, most of them germinated, withered, and fell off, all of which are visible to the eye. It is now estimated that the harvest loss is quite large. The farmers' hard work throughout the year has suddenly been hit by a disaster, and they are extremely distressed. The rural areas have been on the verge of collapse for years, and with another poor harvest, what future troubles can be imagined? Witnessing the situation, it is difficult to remain silent. Therefore, we are sending a special telegram to request your office to quickly send officials to the countryside for inspection and to plan for compassion. We will not dare to be negligent.

<h3>Lu Bohong's Letter Reports the Process of Visiting the Disaster Area in Shandong</h3>
<p>Three Million Disaster Victims in More Than Ten Counties in the Disaster Area - Relief Funds Distributed, Half for Shelter and Half for Emergency Relief</p>
<p>The General Association for the Relief of Flood Victims in Various Provinces received a letter from Lu Bohong, the director of the inspection and relief efforts in Shandong Province, reporting on the process of visiting the disaster area in Shandong. The original letter is summarized below: "I departed from Shanghai on the afternoon of the 17th and arrived in Jinan on the evening of the 18th. I visited various disaster victim shelters. Jinan City has sheltered more than 20,000 disaster victims, divided into 27 shelters. I visited the 9th, 13th, 16th, 17th, and 18th shelters until 11:00 PM. I had discussions with the leaders of the Shandong Provincial Party and government on everything. Currently, the disaster area in western Shandong covers more than ten counties, with no fewer than three million disaster victims. About 300,000 people have been sheltered in various counties, so rescuing those who have not escaped is especially urgent. The allocation of funds is planned to use half to supplement the various shelter organizations and half to handle emergency relief in the disaster area. The Shandong Relief Association and the Public Education Progress Association will cooperate in distributing relief funds. It is now planned to establish an office in Jining. Please send clothing and other items for relief to Yanzhou, which has convenient transportation with Jinan and Jining. In Jinan shelters, women and children account for the majority, and there are records of children falling ill and dying. It is requested to establish medical institutions, and the mayor has strongly requested this. It has been decided to set up two temporary hospitals in Jinan. After I return to Shanghai, male and female doctors and dozens of female nurses will be sent. Caozhou, Jining, and other places will also need hospitals. I will report again after future inspections. I can return to Shanghai around the 25th to report in person. The Shandong relief funds should be remitted gradually after I return to Shanghai. I am now requesting Shandong Bishop Yang, Caozhou Priest Wan, and Yanggu Bishop Tian to help with the distribution of relief to avoid wasting the relief funds."</p>

<h3>Swire's Regular Northern Route Liner Yuezhou Suffers Engine Damage</h3>
<p>Haikou Ship Sent to Tow Back to Shanghai - Must Enter Dock for Major Repairs</p>
<p>The Swire Company's new ship Yuezhou, on its regular northern route, is the sister ship of the new Shuntian ship in terms of size and style, both operating on the North China route. Since arriving in Shanghai, this is the 23rd time it has sailed outwards, including this export trip. The ship was fully loaded with outbound cargo destined for Qingdao, Yantai, Tianjin and other ports for unloading. Because of its speed, the ship is very popular with passengers traveling north. Shanghai to Qingdao takes only 24 hours.</p>
<p>Mid-Trip Engine Damage. Initially, the voyage from Shanghai was quite smooth, but around dusk on the 20th, as it was approaching the outside of Qingdao port, the ship's engine suddenly broke down and the ship lost its ability to navigate, failing to enter Qingdao port. The shipowner telegraphed the Qingdao branch, which immediately dispatched a small steamship from Qingdao to attempt to tow the ship into Qingdao port to unload cargo and passengers.</p>
<p>Ship Sent to Replace. The Shanghai company received the telegram and immediately ordered the company's Hunan ship to transport the cargo and passengers of the Yuezhou ship to Yantai and Tianjin for unloading.</p>
<p>Tow to Shanghai for Major Repairs. Yesterday afternoon, the Shanghai office had already decided that the company's Haikou ship, which was transporting cargo south from Tianjin, would be telegraphed to Qingdao to tow the damaged Yuezhou ship back to Shanghai. According to reliable information from the company, the ship is expected to enter port around the afternoon of tomorrow (the 25th). After arriving in Shanghai, engineers must first inspect the extent of the engine damage before it can enter the dock for major repairs.</p>
<h3>Municipal Federation Sends Letter to Municipal Chamber of Commerce Urging Response to Rent Reduction Movement</h3>
<p>The Municipal Federation of Citizens of the First Special District sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday: "Dear Sirs, Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the vitality of the market in this city has been greatly damaged, and industry and commerce are exhausted to the extreme. The phenomenon of shops being unable to sustain themselves and declaring bankruptcy has become widespread. There are many reasons for this unfortunate situation, but the high cost of rent is also a major factor. However, most landlords are greedy and disregard the rent reduction movement, even relying on the law to oppress tenants, so that Shanghai, which is known as prosperous, has suddenly become a scene of desolation. Our Federation deeply knows that to revitalize the market, rent reduction must come first. Therefore, we are determined to make thorough efforts. Our organization believes that your chamber of commerce is the leader of the Shanghai commercial group, and you have a close relationship with the rise and fall of industry and commerce and the welfare of the citizens in this city. When our association gathers the strength of all citizens to promote the realization of rent reduction and urges Chairman Chiang to issue rent reduction standards, your chamber of commerce should understand that reducing rent will solve the entire social and economic problem, and come forward to respond, so as to relieve the merchants of the city from upside down and pull millions of citizens out of the water and fire. We eagerly await your reply."</p>
<h3>Chinese Ambassador to Germany Cheng Tianfang Scheduled to Sail</h3>

<p>Chinese Ambassador to France Cheng Tianfang, his family, and entourage, totaling thirteen people, originally planned to take the Norddeutscher Lloyd Company's second new ship, the Baden, to Europe when it left the US in the last voyage, but because the cabins were full, they had to postpone their departure. Now that the Norddeutscher Lloyd Company's first new ship, the Scharnhorst, has arrived from Europe, Ambassador Cheng has requested the company to reserve six first-class cabins and five second-class cabins on this ship, and it is scheduled to sail from Shanghai on November 20th.

<h3>Ministry of Industry Approves Establishment of Artificial Silk Factory</h3>
<p>If Funded by Commercial Parties, the Ministry Can Provide Rewards According to Law</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce proposed the establishment of an artificial silk factory to reduce outflows of currency, and has now received a response from the Ministry of Industry: "Received and noted. This case was previously submitted to the Ministry directly by the Shanghai Silk Fabric Industry Association. It was approved and noted that the establishment of an artificial silk factory is indeed a current necessity, and the six proposed methods are not without merit. However, given the current financial difficulties of the national treasury, it is difficult to raise funds for official shares, and it is not appropriate to approve them. If commercial parties raise funds to establish the factory, the Ministry can provide rewards according to law, etc." Based on the previous submission, please be informed accordingly. This is the reply.</p>

Saving a life is better than building a seven-story pagoda. Cultivating virtue and creating blessings is inconceivable. The miserable geese in the great marsh are looking forward to it.</p>

<h3>Representatives of Banking and Money Industries Return to Shanghai to Discuss the Problem of Exemption from Stamp Duty on Checks</h3>
<p>Wang Zhixin and Xi Jimin, the two representatives of the banking and money industries in this city, who were delegated to Nanjing to petition the Legislative Yuan for amendments regarding the stamp duty on checks, returned to Shanghai the night before. Yesterday morning, according to Mr. Wang, who spoke to a reporter from the Central News Agency, he met with Mr. Ma Yinchu, Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Legislative Yuan, in Nanjing and presented his views. The so-called two cents stamp duty on checks is a very small burden for the people, and the government's revenue is also small, but the procedures are very cumbersome, and the promotion of negotiable instruments in our country is not widespread, and the banking business is not very developed. If we want to develop China's economy, the government should actively assist. The issue of stamp duty, although small, is closely related to the development of the negotiable instruments system, and it is hoped that it can be revised. Mr. Ma expressed his acceptance of this idea and agreed to submit it to the meeting for reconsideration. The two representatives were satisfied and returned to Shanghai the night before to report back to the two associations. It is heard that the Stamp Tax Law is related to industry, commerce, finance and other industries. When the new law is promulgated, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce also believes that there are places that should be amended. The association is now soliciting opinions from various industries and drafting memoranda to submit to the Legislative Yuan. The insurance and shipping associations also have opinions to put forward. The Legislative Yuan will wait until the memoranda from various industries are submitted to the meeting before discussing them together.</p>

<h3>Wuxi's Huashanji's Enthusiasm for Disaster Relief - 10,000 Yuan Special Account for Shandong Disaster</h3>
<p>The Renji Road Overseas Relief Association recently received 10,000 yuan in national currency remitted from the Bank of China in Wuxi to Huashanji, stating that it was specifically for donating to Shandong disaster victims for support and emergency relief, with the accompanying condition that it should not be used to repay bank debts. This demonstrates the compassion for the severe yellow disaster in Shandong Province, where the cries of the victims are numerous, and the enthusiasm for rescuing disaster victims as if fighting a fire. It is heard that the association has publicly appointed Director Lu Bohong to be in charge of the Shandong inspection and relief efforts, and he is currently carrying out the efforts in Shandong. Having complied with this intention, this money will be remitted to Shandong immediately and handed over to Mr. Lu for handling.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Reply: Work Contracts Exempt from Stamp Duty, Not Within the Scope of Employment Contracts</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously received an inquiry from the Dachung Dong Match Company regarding how to affix stamps to labor employment contracts. The Chamber of Commerce verified that according to item 25 of the Stamp Tax Law rate schedule, except for appointment letters issued by government agencies and schools that are exempt, all other employment contracts require a stamp of two cents. However, ordinary employment contracts are issued by the employer or hiring party to the employed individual. The work contracts of the Dachung Hua Match Company's laborers, although held by both the employer and the worker, are actually documents established by the worker's side. This differs from the situation of employment contracts. In accordance with principle 4 of the Stamp Tax Law principles set by the Central Political Council, which aims to support farmers and workers, there was some doubt as to whether these contracts could be exempted from stamps. After reporting this to the Ministry of Finance via telegram, the Ministry of Finance issued reply No. 785, stating: "We have received and understood your telegram. Upon review, Article 16 and rate schedule item 25 of the Stamp Tax Law regarding employment contracts refer to documents for employing personnel to assume work. Upon examination of the work contracts for laborers used by the Dachung Hua Match Company, they are specifically for employing laborers and differ from employment contracts. Therefore, they are not within the scope of employment contracts. You should immediately inform them of this decision."</p>

<h3>An Overview of Municipal Public Works Construction in the Past Year</h3>
<p>Since the municipal authorities determined the Great Shanghai plan, the authorities have spared no effort in the construction of municipal public works. In the spring of this year, the municipal government dispatched Shen Yi, the director of the Public Works Bureau, to Europe and the West for inspection. Since Director Shen returned to China, he has carefully planned and strived to improve. The reporter has learned from the bureau the following overview of public works construction in the past year.</p>
<p>Central Urban Area: After the opening of the free central area, various buildings have been constructed one after another. Because the terrain in this area is relatively low, construction must first fill the soil. Therefore, the soil filling project is very large, estimated at more than 10,000 cubic meters. The second concession land and municipal government staff land total more than 1,000 acres, which can accommodate a total ditch of 30 to 90 cm, totaling more than 17,000 meters in length. In terms of road access, in addition to the newly opened Zhengjun East Road, the remaining roads have been gradually improved in order to achieve perfection. For example, Shiguang Road, Shixing Road, Minbei Road, and Minfu Road have all been successively repaved with cinder and gravel surfaces. As for Xiangyin Road from Shuidaidian Road to the central district branch of the Public Security Bureau, the original asphalt road surface was between 4 and 6 meters wide, and it had been severely damaged due to years of disrepair. The road surface has been widened to 9 meters with cold asphalt, and cement curbs have been built on the sides to tidy up the sidewalks. The road surface is smooth and wide, and it has been completely renewed. In terms of all public buildings, in addition to the sports field, swimming pool, gymnasium, and primary school projects, which have all been completed, the library, museum, municipal college, etc. will also be completed one after another soon.</p>
<p>Zhabei Area: Zhabei was severely damaged after the January 28th Incident. In recent years, it has been extensively renovated. For example, Hongjiang Road, Baoxing Road, Hongxing Road, Maichang Road, and Dongbaochang Road have all been rebuilt with asphalt road surfaces after being lighted, totaling more than 5,000 meters in length, and double curbs and cement sidewalks have been built. More than 1,000 meters of main ditches have been installed at Dongbaoshan Road and Jiaotong Road. Zhenda Road, Tonghe Road, Huasheng Road, etc., have more than 4,000 meters of cinder roads constructed. Jiangwan Wanshi Street, etc., have also been rebuilt with stone road surfaces. After the central part of the Zhabei district, since Baoshan Road and Qiujiang Road have been renovated and completed, the vertical and horizontal traffic has been greatly facilitated.</p>
<p>South Shanghai Area: In the South Shanghai area, Fangxie Road has low-lying terrain and no ditch facilities, and the road surface has been particularly damaged. Ditches and pipes have been constructed, the roadbed has been raised, and cold asphalt roads have been paved, covering 1,000 meters. Zhonghua Road originally had a stone road surface, and the trams running on it were particularly damaged. 1,800 meters of cold asphalt road surface were rebuilt. The Limar Road was originally a stone road surface, and the section near Dongmen was narrow and the traffic was heavy, which urgently needed to be improved. The section from Dongmen Road to the Dama Pier has been widened according to the prescribed route, and 500 meters of cold asphalt road surface have been rebuilt. Lujiabang Road was originally a cinder road surface, but as the city became more prosperous, the section east of Chezhan Road was paved with a stone road surface, 1,500 meters long, and the section west of Chezhan Road was paved with an asphalt road surface, 700 meters long. In addition, 500 feet of stone road surface were built on the Pubin Road.</p>
<p>Pudong Area: There were no heavy engineering projects in the Pudong area during the year, and most of them were improvements. For example, Chunshan Road was paved with stones and ditches were laid for more than 500 meters, Handu Road was paved with stones for more than 1,500 meters, Xiliqiao Road was paved with stones for more than 500 meters, and Zhanglou West Road and Lao Baitu were also successively rebuilt with stone road surfaces.</p>
<h3>Wanxiang Ship From Fujian Loads in Min Returns to Shanghai: Sending Back a Large Number of Workers and Refugees</h3>
<p>More Than 160 Northern Workers; 174 Hubei Refugees</p>
<p>Chen Yi, Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government, stated that the construction department of the province had previously recruited more than 160 northern workers to build roads. Because the road construction project had been completed, the workers needed to return to their hometowns. Therefore, he instructed Sun Dajun, the liaison officer of the construction department, to supervise the workers mentioned above, who arrived in Shanghai on the Wanxiang ship the night before, docked at Pier No. 1 south of the Sixteenth Pier in the South City, and landed ashore. Huang Junfu, the chief of the Sixteenth Pier Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau in charge, dispatched Inspector Su and police officers to escort them to the Sanguantang Temple in Qiaojiabang, where they spent the night. Yesterday (the 23rd), they moved to the Chaohuishan Villa on Chezhan Road. In advance, Chairman Chen telegraphed the municipal government of this city, instructing the Public Security Bureau to provide travel expenses and find ways to send them back to their hometowns. It is also learned that the Wanxiang also carries 174 Hubei Hanyang men, women, old and young refugees to Shanghai. Zhang Siwei, a representative of the refugees, went to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to request repatriation to their hometowns.</p>
<h3>British Military Officer: Assaults Korean Mistress</h3>
<p>Korean young woman Jiang Yexigu, also known as Mary, 24 years old, lives at No. 30 Hengchang Lane, Yuyuan Road. She had a bond with Anderson, a British military officer living at No. 7 Jing'an Villa, Jing'an Temple Road. Recently, due to disagreements, there have been frequent quarrels. At around 10 PM the night before, Mary and Anderson had another major conflict at An's residence, followed by mutual beatings. However, Mary was ultimately weak and was conquered by Anderson. At that time, Anderson, fearing that there might be an accident, called Mary's sister that night and asked her to take Mary back. Yesterday morning, Mary's sister also specially accompanied Mary to An's residence to mediate between the two, hoping that both parties would reconcile. However, Mary and An had another conflict over a word, and even started fighting. An was momentarily angry, forgetting the old love of the past. Under the force of the moment, he actually broke Mary's right arm, causing her to fall to the ground in pain and writhe in pain. At this time, Anderson, seeing that he had caused trouble and recalling the past, suddenly felt pity again. He automatically reported to the police station, dispatched a car to send Mary to the Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road for treatment, and stated the process, deeply regretting his rashness. As for why they fought each other, it is said that it was caused by a love affair.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Buddhist Association: Lawsuit Against Cihang Newspaper Expected to be Resolved; Shan Quyingguang and Others Come Forward to Mediate</h3>
<p>The Cihang Weekly newspaper office on the second floor of Juelin Vegetarian Restaurant, No. 254 Avenue Joffre, published news on June 17 this year about the replacement of abbots at the Li'an Temple in Hangzhou. The text involved damage to the reputation of the Hangzhou Buddhist Association. Therefore, Quefei (abbot of Lingyin Temple), Yuetao (abbot of Fajing Temple), and Benlian (abbot of Zhaoqing Temple), as standing committee members of the association and legal representatives, hired lawyer Gu Kenfu to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the Second Branch, suing Zhong Lida, Liu Wuxi, and Long Jianxing, the issuing manager and editors of Cihang Weekly, for defamation, requesting legal investigation and prosecution, and attaching a civil lawsuit, requesting a judgment ordering the publication of the judgment in major Shanghai and Hangzhou newspapers for three days, and compensation for damages of one yuan. The case has been repeatedly subpoenaed by the First Special Court. Because the defendants did not arrive, the date was changed. This newspaper has already recorded the details. Yesterday, Judge Chen Pusheng of the Second Special Court held a hearing to continue the interrogation. None of the parties involved were present. Only the plaintiff's lawyer, Gu Kenfu, arrived and said that the case is currently being mediated and reconciled by layman Qu Yingguang and Wang Yiting, and they are currently in contact. He requested the court to allow the date to be changed again. He also said that the defendant had previously stated in court that Quefei had a relationship with his fourth concubine. Upon investigation, it was actually Gu Lutao who impersonated a reporter from the Weifeng News Agency and published in the newspaper that Quefei had an affair with a certain nun. After Quefei saw the report, he also published a statement to defend himself. After Chen Xiaopu, the president of the Weifeng News Agency, learned about it, he investigated and prosecuted Gu Lutao in the Hangzhou Local Court. As a result, Gu was sentenced to three months in prison for two crimes of intimidation. Case file No. 93 of the 18th year can be checked. It is sufficient to show that the facts stated by the defendant are also inconsistent and deliberately defame the reputation, etc. After verifying the words, the court approved the change of date to 10:00 AM on the 30th of this month for another interrogation.</p>
<h3>Pawned a Friend's Clothes: Forced to Return Them, Ashamed and Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>Bao Yongsheng, a native of Ningbo, is 20 years old and works as a student at a certain electrical materials company on Zhapu Road.

He suddenly had the idea of dying. After getting up at 6:30 AM yesterday, he secretly took Lysol and committed suicide.

The important matters of the day were to amend the articles of association to comply with the Company Law for easy supervision and registration and to increase the number of directors. Chairman Liu Wanqing briefly reported that this mine is the only industry in the local area, with extremely rich coal reserves. Unfortunately, since the company started, it has suffered many setbacks. The biggest blow was in the twelfth year of the Republic, when the mine site was destroyed by war, resulting in more than eight years of unemployment. In other aspects, it has also been subject to various constraints, making it impossible to realize the company's plans and regrettably abandoning the great wealth on the ground. The current method of salvation is to find ways to recover management rights and raise funds for expanding production. Therefore, it is proposed to increase the number of directors and elect shareholders with prestige to jointly organize and promote the development of the business.</p>

<h3>Gave Birth Seven Months After Marriage</h3>
<p>The Child Was Found to Belong to the Brother-in-Law, Not Constituting an Offense Against Public Morality</p>

She lost her mother at a young age and has been living in her brother-in-law Zhou Bingrong's house at No. 6 Ping'an Lane, Yangjiazhai, Pudong, for the past few years.

However, she gave birth to a baby girl just seven months after marriage. Ji knew that something was wrong because the child was not yet a full term. He questioned Xiaomei, and she confessed that before she got married, she had been raped once by her brother-in-law Bingrong when her sister was out, resulting in pregnancy. Li was furious and sent the baby girl to Zhou's house yesterday morning, but Zhou refused to accept it, resulting in a dispute. The police arrived at the scene and took the plaintiff Ji Shiming, the defendant Zhou Bingrong, and Xiaomei to the Pudong Branch Bureau.

<h3>Shanghai National Products Merchant Zhang Liao and Others Found Zhejiang National Products Company</h3>
<p>Construction Contract Signed; Business Scope Divided into Five Major Parts</p>
<p>The Zhejiang National Products Company was founded by Shanghai national products magnates Zhang Ziqing and others. It has built a seven-story building covering more than seven acres. When the construction project was tendered in June, the prices bid by various construction companies exceeded the company's budget too much, so the contracting agreement has not been signed until now. Now, the Lin Tai Xinyi Construction Company has reached an agreement with the general manager of the Zhejiang National Products Company on the modified conditions, and the contract was officially signed the day before yesterday. As soon as the Hangzhou Exhibition Hall building is demolished and the company’s purchased government land on Ciyou Road is acquired, a groundbreaking ceremony will be held on a scheduled date to commence construction. The company's business scope includes five major parts: real estate, banks, commercial markets, hotels, and cinemas. The real estate part has already been organized and the shares have been fully paid up according to the law. It is now heard that the national products market is also starting to collect shares, and those who pay shares are extremely enthusiastic. After the construction of the National Products First Wharf is completed, matters such as local products, foreign trade, and transportation will be handled in advance. The company's general manager, Zhang Ziqing, plans to reside in Hangzhou permanently in order to actively carry out the work.</p>

<h3>Two Corpses, Blood Staining the Ground</h3>
<p>Mrs. Jin Was Already Dead; The Maid Was Barely Alive. Photography Studio Employee Pushed the Door Open and Shouted in Horror</p>
<p>The address at No. 459, the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and North Henan Road, is an old Western-style single-family house. The lessee is a Suzhou widow in her forties, with a son and a daughter aged about fifteen or sixteen. Her son is studying at the Public School in the Northern District of the Shanghai Municipal Council on Ke Neng Hai Road. People generally call the woman Mrs. Jin. Her second floor and the bottom floor are rented to Rong Kang Hua Xing and Xie Long Trading Company. She lives on the third floor, and only hires a maid to serve her. Her daily life seems to be that of a petty bourgeois family. At about 10:00 AM yesterday morning, when Mrs. Jin had not yet gotten up, a photography studio assigned an employee to deliver photos taken by Mrs. Jin some time ago. At that time, the employee saw that Mrs. Jin's door was closed, so he knocked on the door and called out. However, there was no response for a long time, so he pushed the door open, and the door was not locked. To his surprise, there were two corpses in front of his eyes. After careful examination, one was Mrs. Jin and the other was the maid. Blood stained the ground. At that time, the employee was horrified and shouted, quickly turned around and went downstairs, and rushed to the Huishi Police Station to report. After receiving the report, the police station immediately dispatched detectives to investigate and found that Mrs. Jin had already died, and the maid was dying, covered in knife wounds. They quickly sent the maid to the Sanatorium Hospital for treatment, and sent Mrs. Jin's body to the morgue for autopsy, and carefully examined the remains in the room and took pictures for filing. As for the reason for the murder, there are different opinions. If the maid can be saved, the case will not be difficult to solve.</p>

<h3>Zhang Mengzhou's Good Times Don't Last Long: Two Concubines Flee Simultaneously</h3>
<p>The youngest concubine, Shang Si, is asked to return, and the court reschedules the hearing.</p>
<p>Nanjing: Zhang Mengzhou, a clerk in Nanjing and a native of Sheng County, is forty-eight years old. His original wife, Cao, has borne him a son and two daughters, all over ten years old. However, Zhang, being a long-time resident in Shanghai, felt his life was rather dull. He then made every effort to find beautiful women to amuse himself. Through the efforts of pimps and matchmakers, he began cohabiting with Lin Cuiying, a woman from Xiangshan, in February of this year. Zhang was well aware that current laws do not allow concubinage, so although he had Lin to share his bed, he never gave her a formal title. Unexpectedly, after more than a month of cohabitation, Zhang suddenly became more ambitious and took in Pan Xiaofeng, also from Xiangshan, to fulfill his wish of having women on both sides. Miss Pan was in her prime, with a plump figure, still retaining her rustic charm. After joining Zhang's household, she and Lin were ranked as sisters, with Lin being the elder sister and Pan the younger. They got along quite well, and initially, they knew how to be good wives to Zhang. All of Zhang's friends envied him for having such good luck in his middle age, managing to achieve such a feat with one arrow. Unexpectedly, Zhang was unable to enjoy this kind of romantic life for long. On the morning of the 21st of last month, while Zhang was away at the pharmacy, the two women suddenly fled together, taking all the belongings in the residence. Upon receiving a phone call from the landlord, he rushed back to his residence at No. 3, Lane 1405, Rue Edouard VII, only to find that the women had disappeared. He immediately started investigating and learned the whole story of the two women's escape. It turned out that there was a third party directing things behind the scenes. However, he was worried that publicizing the matter would escalate the incident, and it would not only affect his reputation. But unwilling to let his belongings be sacrificed, he reported to the police station, requesting an investigation. At the same time, he hired lawyers Fan Gang and Fan Qisheng to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court, requesting that the two women be ordered to return to cohabitation and return the property. He claimed that at the beginning of their cohabitation, the two women were harmonious, but in the past month or two, their temperament had suddenly changed. They put on makeup and went out for fun. When he tried to persuade them, they retorted. On the 21st of last month, they suddenly took their clothes and belongings, loaded them onto four rickshaws, and fled together. Later, they even sent a letter through lawyer Wang, falsely claiming that the plaintiff had abandoned them, but they did not mention the items they had taken. The plaintiff believed that their actions were entirely influenced by others, so he sent a letter back, informing them to return home immediately and bring back the items, promising not to pursue the matter. Who knew that they ignored him, so he had to sue, and so on. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Peng Shi opened the court to summon the two defendants. Only Pan Xiaofeng arrived. Zhang Mengzhou recounted the process of taking the two concubines and presented two documents signed by the families of Pan and Lin as evidence. Then, he claimed that his original wife in his hometown already knew about the concubinage and that he had decided to give all his family property in his hometown to his wife and children, while the living expenses of the two concubines would be provided by his income in Shanghai, and so on. Questioned, the defendant Pan Xiaofeng testified that Zhu Yuying was the matchmaker, and negotiations began in December of last year. Zhu brought one hundred yuan and said that Zhang was marrying a substitute wife. On the fifth day of the first lunar month of this year, she went to Shanghai from her hometown with Zhu and her uncle and met Zhang in the inn. The next day, Zhu said that Zhang did not like her, and the matter was not successful. She returned to Xiangshan. On the seventh day of the first month, she was summoned by Zhang's letter, so she went to Shanghai again with her mother and uncle. Her aunt then signed the note in the hotel, and from then on, she became Zhang's concubine. Recently, Lin Cuiying repeatedly said that Zhang was going to sell her, so she ordered them to flee together, and she was deceived by her. She is now willing to follow Zhang. All her clothes and belongings were taken away by Lin. Lin is now at her cousin's place at 1765 next to the China Hotel on Guizhou Road, and she is staying at a relative's house of Zhu Yuying at Dadongmen, and so on. Judge Peng then instructed to reschedule the hearing and summon Lin Cuiying to court for further questioning. After the court adjourned, Pan Xiaofeng, lacking living expenses, wanted to return with Zhang immediately, but Zhang, with the lawsuit unresolved, not only did not immediately take her in but took out eight small coins and gave them to her.</p>
<h3>Taxpayers Association Asks the Municipal Council to Stop the Police from Inspecting Goods Entering and Exiting Warehouses</h3>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday, which stated: "We are writing to inform you that, according to a letter from Renyuhao, our company has been operating a Ningbo Hengfeng Factory cloth business at No. 3, Ruixingfang, North Wuxi Road, for many years. We rent a warehouse at No. 333, Hainning Road, North Fujian Road. Every day, goods entering and exiting the warehouse are inspected and fined by the police. Last year, we wrote to your council asking for assistance in resolving this matter, but unexpectedly, the police have suddenly resumed inspecting our warehouse. We are not sure why. Moreover, this warehouse area is located in a quiet area with a fixed flow of goods entering and exiting, and it does not obstruct the traffic of passersby in any way. Our limited scope of business is already suffering from the economic downturn. Any inspection would cause great alarm and distress. Therefore, we are writing to ask your council to help alleviate the hardship of businesses and instruct the police department to find a way to prevent future inspections, for which we would be eternally grateful." The letter stated that the warehousing of goods in Shanghai is a necessary practice for commerce. Without this practice, there would be no commerce, and no business, public or private, could operate. Reading the letter, every line is filled with fear and despair, making one feel that it is not easy to be a businessman. We are therefore writing to your bureau to ask you to find a way to prevent taxpayers from experiencing a situation where the government is more fierce than a tiger. We earnestly hope for this." Addressed to: Mr. Fei, Acting Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession.</p>
<h3>The French Municipal Council Denies Collecting Garbage Fees</h3>
<p>This issue of the French Concession Municipal Council's weekly municipal report denies the rumor that residents will have to pay extra for garbage disposal. It states that the garbage disposal regulations issued by the French Consulate in July 1932 have not been changed in any way. The garbage on the roads within the concession is cleaned up by the coolies dispatched by the Municipal Council, and no fees are charged. However, residents in the alleys who need the Municipal Council to clean up their garbage must pay 4% of the house tax every six months. It is reported that the Municipal Council's denial is because the Russian-language "Daily News" recently published a statement that the Municipal Council would collect garbage fees. The newspaper believed that the Municipal Council prohibited the sale of ten days in the concession.</p>

<h3>Youth Association's Youth Movement Work Team Departs</h3>
<p>The members of the Youth and Religious Movement Tour Work Team organized by the National Youth Association gathered in Shanghai last week, held a retreat, and are scheduled to depart tomorrow (the 25th) to visit various educational centers in China. The Youth and Religious Movement was initiated by the 12th National Congress of the Youth Association two years ago, with the aim of enabling educated youth in China to accept Christianity in their practical lives. Significant progress has been made in developing this activity. Many major cities in China have also established local committees to cooperate with the National Association and are responsible for carrying out this work. Participants include churches, conferences, and middle schools. The feature of the Youth and Religious Movement this fall is the organization of tour work teams. The team members include famous Chinese Christian leaders, including Dr. Chen Wenyuan, head of the Psychology Department of Fukien Christian University, Dr. Tu Yuqing, head of the Physics Department of Shanghai University, Miss Zeng Baosun, founder and principal of I-fang Girls' School, and Jiang Wenhan, Liang Chuanqin, and Shang Awu, secretaries of the National Association.

<h3>Request to Stop the Armed Drills of Railway Police at the North Station: Petitions from the Two Railway Party Headquarters and One District Branch</h3>
<p>The railway police under the jurisdiction of the Jinghu and Huhangyong Railway Police Department have recently been conducting armed drills in front of and behind the North Station Garden and on the North Station platform every day. The First District Branch of the Railway Party Headquarters believes that this is detrimental to traffic order and obstructs passengers. They have specially petitioned to request a stop. The original petition is extracted as follows: "Petition requesting that the Special Party Headquarters be forwarded to the Railway Bureau, ordering the Police Department not to send police to conduct drills at the North Station, in order to reassure travelers. On the 19th of this month, the Police Department staff led forty to fifty railway police officers in full armed gear, conducting drills on the North Station Garden outside the fence and on the platform inside the station. They shouted commands, creating a tense situation. Spectators gathered, and the arriving and departing passengers were shocked to see a large group of police officers. The staff of various agencies near the North Station frequently heard loud shouts, and their moods were disrupted. The North Station is the main station for the two railways, with tens of thousands of passengers arriving and departing every day. There are many vehicles, and it is often crowded. When the railway police conduct drills here, if people give way to the vehicles, the police team will not be in formation, and if the vehicles give way to the people, traffic will be obstructed. The police department has training grounds in Jiangwan, Tiantong'an, and the McGuinness Road car repair field, but they do not use them. They uniquely use the North Station, where traffic is congested, as a training ground. Their intention is difficult to understand. At a time when business is slow and rumors are rampant, this kind of action seems inappropriate. The 11th First Executive Committee meeting of this branch decided to petition for a letter to be forwarded to the Railway Bureau, ordering the Police Department not to send police to conduct drills at the North Station, in order to reassure people and maintain traffic. This document is respectfully submitted, and we hope that it will be forwarded to the Railway Bureau, ordering the Police Department not to send police to conduct drills at the North Station, in order to reassure people and maintain traffic."</p>
<h3>Child Run Over and Killed by Truck</h3>
<p>On the evening of the 3rd of this month at 7:50 PM, on Yangshupu Road opposite Meizhou Road, a truck (license plate number unknown) drove past and ran over a six-year-old child on the road, killing him. The driver, seeing that he had caused a disaster, did not stop the car. At that time, someone blew a whistle to summon the police. The driver then turned off the front and rear lights of the car and sped away. If anyone witnessed the accident at that time and can report the license plate number of the car to any police station, leading to the case being solved, the police station will reward thirty yuan.</p>
<h3>Ding Asong Stabs Two People for Failing to Support His Call for a Strike</h3>
<p>At a Western-style women's clothing workshop at No. 17, Anle Lane, Shian Temple Road, three workers from Pudong were employed: Ding Asong, Chen Youjiang, and Gu Wensheng. Recently, Ding Asong's work was poor, which led to his dismissal by the employer. After losing his job, Ding demanded that Chen and Gu follow him on strike. However, Chen and others did not agree to his request, and Ding held a grudge. At around 10:30 PM last night, Ding went to Chen's place alone. Without explanation, he took out a pair of scissors and stabbed Chen in the chest, causing blood to gush out like a spring. When he started to attack, Gu Wensheng witnessed everything on the spot and rushed forward to dissuade him. He was also stabbed by Ding, once in the left shoulder and once in the lower jaw. Fortunately, the injuries were minor. The two were then taken to Renji Hospital by the No. 34 patrolmen of the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station.</p>
<h3>Further Hearing in the Case of Chinese Police Officer Pei Xueshi Accused of Killing His Mistress: Adjourned Pending Summons of Key Witnesses</h3>
<p>Pei Xueshi, a Chinese police officer from Yancheng at the Jianghai Customs Water Police Station, had a relationship with a woman named Fan Asan (the concubine of the deceased Zheng Kaijun). They rented a house and lived together. Fan Asan suddenly disappeared in the winter of last year. Later, Fan Asan's body was found in a remote place on Mayushan Road, covered in knife wounds. At that time, the local court sent personnel to verify the body. Later, the deceased's elder sister, Zeng Fan, identified the body and arranged for the coffin. She claimed that her sister had private savings of more than one thousand yuan, which were almost all used up by Pei through deception. There were conflicts at the time, but they were resolved through mediation. Pei issued a note for five hundred yuan, and they reconciled. Zeng Fan kept the note. Since the tragedy occurred, the elder sister of the deceased, Zeng Fan, suspected Pei Xueshi. Based on the situation, she reported to the local court, and prosecutor Zhang Zi investigated and clarified the matter, and initiated a public prosecution for the crime of inciting murder. Judge Tan Zhuo held an open trial, which was not concluded. Pei Xueshi was detained and awaited further trial. All the details have been recorded in previous reports. Yesterday afternoon at 4:50 PM, Judge Zhong continued the trial in the 12th courtroom. The plaintiff, Zeng Fan, and lawyer Su Quya from the Soviet District were present, requesting to pursue a private prosecution for one thousand yuan in private savings, five hundred yuan in deposits, one thousand six hundred and eighty yuan in funeral expenses, and two hundred yuan in funeral expenses. The defendant, Lawyer Wu, was present to defend him. After the official went to the hall, he ordered Pei Xueshi, who was in custody, to be brought to the case and asked together. Pei repeatedly claimed his innocence and requested an investigation. Next, the witness Gu Zhuguan testified. At the end, the plaintiff, Zeng Fan, brought Zeng Shunjin, the six-year-old son of Fan Asan, to the case, requesting justice for the deceased. The official obtained the testimony and adjourned the debate because the key witnesses Zheng Wu and others had not arrived. He would summon the witnesses and continue the trial. The defendant was still in prison. When he left the court, the lights of thousands of families were already on.</p>

Among them, Ren Bonian's works are the most numerous and are all rare treasures, a dazzling array that is a feast for the eyes. All calligraphy and painting enthusiasts can feast their eyes.</p>

<p>Auction of Interior Equipment of the Mentua Ship Handled by Louis Moore &amp; Company</p>
<p>The British Union Shipping Company currently has three coal-fired seagoing vessels of more than 10,000 tons. The Mentua is one of them. It was built in 1909 at a cost of 500,000 gold pounds. At that time, it was proud of everything. However, as the ship aged, it became less suitable. It was decided to sell it to Maofeng Foreign Company for dismantling and auction the ship's interior furniture and other noble cups and utensils. The auction will be held on the ship this Saturday (the 28th) and will be handled by the well-known auctioneer Louis Moore &amp; Company. It will be conducted in two sessions, starting at 10:00 AM and 2:30 PM. Therefore, there will be small transfers at the New Customs Wharf at 9:30 AM and 2:00 PM to pick up people attending the auction to the ship. It seems that it is an unprecedented event to auction objects on such a large ship in Shanghai. There will definitely be a lot of excitement at that time. In this small news trend, a "Phenomenon Daily" will reappear in society with the latest attitude. The main contributors are Mao Zipei, and the editors are Chen Dieyi and Xie Tihong. The content focuses on current affairs news and essays. A "Symphony" supplement is opened, edited by Tang Yu, specializing in articles about the film, song, dance, and drama. In addition, famous writers are specially invited to write long novels and draw cartoons. All materials are based on adapting to the society. The founding meeting has now been established, located at No. 659, Lloyd Road, Ningbo Road, telephone number 93998.</p>

<h3>Special Item: Opinions on the Issue of Increasing Credit Instruments</h3>
<p>Four. Deformities in the Long-Term Capital Market's Credit Instruments: There are deformities in the long-term capital market. First, the predominance of foreign commercial securities; second, the imbalanced development of fiscal securities in the Chinese commercial securities market; and third, the high liquidity of real estate deeds. In short, the current long-term capital market is by no means an industrial and commercial long-term capital market under the Chinese national economic system. Please elaborate:</p>
<p>Before the silver crisis, foreign-owned public companies, with the assistance of foreign banks, actively bought and sold foreign commercial securities in China. There were as many as one hundred and several dozen types of listed stocks and corporate bonds. Prominent foreign commercial enterprises in China, such as the Shanghai Electric Power Company and the Shanghai Telephone Company, issued tens of millions of dollars worth of preferred stocks and bonds each time. Even Shanghai municipal bonds were handled by them. At that time, the average return on securities listed in the public exchange was only six to seven percent per annum, which was significantly lower compared to the returns on securities listed on the Chinese commercial securities exchange, which often exceeded one percent per annum. Chinese industrialists only knew to complain about the excessive burden of interest, but they were unaware that the deficiencies in the structure of the capital market had long created unfavorable conditions for Chinese industrialists. The phenomenon of foreign commercial securities predominating in the market, and the phenomenon of foreign dominance in commercial operations, had a direct causal relationship. Conversely, in the Chinese commercial securities exchange, stock listings were rare, and almost all transactions were the buying and selling of government bonds. As a result of this deformed development, the Chinese commercial securities exchange had become a purely fiscal securities market, rather than a long-term capital market for industry and commerce. Industrialists and merchants had no means to issue stocks and corporate bonds, and had to borrow short-term funds for long-term capital use. The drawbacks of this were that the financial industry had one more type of claim that was prone to freezing, while industry and commerce, in addition to bearing high interest rates, faced the risk of being forced to repay debts at any time. In short, if an industrial securities market is not established, the corporate organization will not be able to develop. It will be difficult to start new industries, and it will be difficult for existing industries to survive. Due to the deficiencies in the structure of the long-term capital market, foreign investment in China tended towards the real estate in the concessions. Chinese people followed suit, and the business policies of some foreign banks not only recognized the real estate deeds in the concessions as targets for long-term loans, but even considered them as collateral for short-term financing. Their high liquidity was almost the same as that of the first-class securities and bills in various countries, which was a rare phenomenon in the financial history of various countries. As a result of this deformed development, not only did Shanghai capital flow into real estate instead of productive industries, but even inland capital flowed into Shanghai for real estate speculation. At that time, real estate deeds were not only the most liquid credit instrument, but also the most valuable credit instrument. The value of real estate in the Shanghai Public Concession and the French Concession, based on land price alone, had reached 1.4 billion yuan according to the valuation of the municipal authorities. Even today, although times have changed, its serious impact on the national economy is still worthy of deep consideration. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Zhu Weixuan)</p>
<p>A brand-new piece of clothing, suddenly stained with a stain, is certainly unsightly and makes people hate it, but the stain on the clothing can be removed, and if it cannot, at most only one piece of clothing is sacrificed. Only a stain on one's character is a lifelong defect, a permanent blemish. However, people in today's society often ignore the stain on their character, and instead fuss over the blemish on their clothing.</p>
<p>In the trams of Beiping, it is often seen that young men in suits and leather shoes give their seats to (modern) women. It is said that this is because women are physically weak and cannot bear the burden of standing, so it is an action that polite young people should take; but I wonder what these polite young people would think if they saw women and their husbands carrying sedan chairs up the mountain while hiking? Perhaps they would be sitting comfortably in the sedan chair, and still be saying that they are not strong enough and do not walk fast enough!</p>
<p>After a person dies, if the portrait hanging in the True Likeness Pavilion is somewhat similar to the person's appearance before death, it will immediately be discovered and cannot be concealed at all; however, the elegiac couplets praising their merits hanging next to the True Likeness Pavilion, and the grand eulogy and mournful account of their deeds in their obituary, although completely inconsistent with the person's reality before death, no one will criticize them. This is truly a great question!</p>
<h3>Huishan Clay Figures</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>A friend from Wuxi sent me two clay figures produced in Huishan, one is a curly-haired fashionable girl, and the other is a naked woman with protruding breasts. I am ashamed that I am not an artist and have no way to appreciate them, so I have to give them to my two children at home to play with.</p>
<p>Speaking of the clay figures of Xishan, they also have a long history in small crafts; and they are also famous far and wide. I remember when I was a child, when I was "worshipping Buddha" with my neighborhood friends, I was playing with this kind of thing. There were Big Afu figures with fat heads and big ears, with a bun on their heads, and a big belly; there were also Wenchang figures with white faces and long beards, wearing red robes; and there were also Zhao Xuantan figures holding whips and riding tigers with golden faces. These were all products of Huishan, and we children treasured them like precious gems. Now that times have advanced, the kinds mentioned above are only for children in the countryside to play with, and the current sculptures are mostly of models, children, and fashionable girls; there are also Liu Guan Zhang's oath of brotherhood, and the Three Stars of Fortune, Prosperity, and Longevity. Belonging to the dramatic aspects, such as the civet cat for the prince, the wax temple, and Baishuitan. There are also Peking Opera faces, with all kinds of roles, such as sheng, dan, jing, and chou; but there are only heads and faces without bodies, only for a few opera fans to enjoy.</p>
<p>The shaping of a clay figure also involves several steps: first, mixing the clay, second, making the embryo, third, coloring, and fourth, applying oil. There are hundreds of families at the foot of Huishan who rely on it for a living! However, I hope that they will further improve, imitating the method of Western plaster statues, to sculpt all kinds of figures. The colors should not be gaudy, but should strive for elegance and generosity; the postures should also be lively and vivid, and should not fall into vulgarity and dullness, so that they will not worry about not occupying a place in the art world!</p>
<h3>Transformation</h3>
<p>— Da Mu</p>
<p>Old Ke has changed. He gets angry at the drop of a hat and says, "I don't want friends anymore. Friends have deceived me enough. My spirit is also suffering enough. Let me be alone." He moved his room from Tangjia Lane to the Sun Temple to live in. He doesn't write letters to people, and he doesn't reply to letters that people send him. He works as a (errand boy) in a large hotel. Many women with flamboyant outfits pass before his eyes all day and night. He always mutters in his throat: "Women, unreliable women, you either chase after foreign money or fall in love with pretty boys. Old Ke, alas, Old Ke has suffered enough from you..."</p>
<p>Old Ke is not yet twenty-eight years old, but he looks like he is close to forty. He has been through the hardships of the world since he was a child without a home or family. He has a natural and generous temperament with many friends, and his face full of short beards has the style of "Hu Dahai," but he can write unrestrained erotic poems. He often subtly expresses to his friends that he lacks the comfort of the opposite sex. Later, through the introduction of friends, he also met several girlfriends! Female clerks, female poets, female students, singing stars...</p>
<p>However, he was all abandoned halfway. Some girlfriends ran away with his friends. So, he cursed all his friends: "You have deceived me spiritually. You have stolen my soul and loyalty!" In the past, he had given up alcohol, quit smoking, and stopped writing poetry for his girlfriends... He had been a submissive follower for a period of time. Now, his pink dream is shattered, and he always hides alone in his room drinking, drinking... cursing...</p>
<p>"Old Ke has changed, he's gone crazy," friends all tell each other indifferently.</p>

<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 19: The High Official Cherishes His Reputation and Knows How to Knock on Doors, A New Love Leaves Her Flesh and Blood, Visiting the Sick is Impossible</p>
<p>When Jie Fu saw his situation, he knew that he was more anxious than Lan Zhuanshi, so he smiled and said: "Then, I will go." As he spoke, he walked towards Jia Duocai's side. This was really embarrassing enough. Seeing that Secretary Qiu was loyal to his master, always looking at people from above, not allowing him to retreat, he slowly walked to the door of Jia Duocai's room, but saw that the light in his room was as small as a bean. Through the dim paper window, it was easiest to see this little bit of light. Jia Duocai made no sound, but he heard the little girl Yueying crying again. This was really difficult to handle. If he called out to Mr. Jia at this time, he would not be happy. And Yueying was still crying. If he spoke through the window, he was even more afraid that people would say that he was exploring secrets. After hesitating for a while, he looked at the upstairs again, guessing that Ze Cheng was in a high and bright place, unable to see this dark and low place. So, he walked to the corner of the wall and, talking to himself, deliberately imitating Jia Duocai's accent, said in a low voice: "Since you have come and said this, I will give you face and not hold it against you." Then he said in his own voice: "Thank you, thank you, I will treat you to dinner in the future." After muttering for a while, he said loudly: "Okay! We have an agreement." Only then did he leave the corner of the wall, deliberately passing under the stairs, and going to the side of Zhou Yourong's room. His room was in a small courtyard, which Ze Cheng could not see even if he was standing upstairs in the east building. This was much more generous. He stood in the middle of the small courtyard, looked at the stars in the sky for a while, estimating that it had been eight or ten minutes, before turning around and walking out of the courtyard. Ze Cheng seemed to take this matter very seriously, and he was still standing by the railing upstairs. Jie Fu suddenly had a thought in his heart, and he had a brilliant plan. He quickened his pace and ran up the stairs. (323)</p>
<h3>Records of Imperial Incense Drifting</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>In addition to Danfeng Chaoyang, other more valuable chrysanthemums include Bailongxu, Zijinling, Xueqiu, and Yuguotianqing, several dozen kinds, one (page) is not enough to list them; (even if) they are listed, there is no interest, so here is determined to omit them all.</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager's love for flowers is very much in the style of a scholar. She certainly does not limit her love to mere appreciation: she wants to fully utilize them for every kind of flower. For example, she takes various fresh flowers to be used as specimens for the female workers who do embroidery, and she makes cosmetics from the juice of roses and phoenix flowers, all of which are very meaningful. So, how does the Empress Dowager use chrysanthemums? She uses (them) as food in the following way:</p>
<p>First, she picks one or two (blooms) of the white chrysanthemum called Xueqiu, probably because the petals of Xueqiu are short and dense, and very clean, so they are especially suitable for cooking; she always picks and eats them. After picking them, she plucks all the petals together, picks out those that are scorched yellow or have dirt on them and throws them away, then immerses the remaining ones in warm water for one or two minutes, then takes them out, and then puts them in warm water that has been dissolved with alum, and finally scoops them up, puts them in a bamboo basket to drain, and that is considered to be properly prepared. The second step is, of course, the beginning of cooking. The Empress Dowager is always very excited before trying this special food, like a villager who is about to attend a feast. (423)</p>

<h3>The Art of Tattooing in England</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>In London, the capital of England, there is a European-renowned tattoo expert named Gilbert, whose office is on North Lambeth Street. His door is like a market, and people come to him every day to have flowers or characters tattooed on their bodies to leave a permanent souvenir. There are young people, (middle-aged) people, good people, rich people, beautiful girls, even sailors, businessmen, and thieves, all going to ask him to tattoo flowers or characters on their bodies to leave a permanent memento. Once a flower or character is tattooed on, it will never disappear. If you want to change the design, you have to find a way to cover the old design with a new design. If you must remove it, it will take a lot of time and effort, and the handling fee will be considerable.</p>
<p>In general, young people in love often run to Gilbert's door and ask him to tattoo a little Cupid or two hearts on their chest or back, and even tattoo the name of his lover next to it, such as Mary, Joan, Anna, and so on. Young and beautiful women also like this tattooing game very much. There was once a beautiful girl of about twenty years old who, because she fell in love with a young man named White, specially asked Gilbert to tattoo the words "I Love White" on her snow-white jade back and left happily. A week later, she suddenly rushed back to find Gilbert, saying that White was angry with her and she now wanted to remove the words tattooed on her back. Gilbert advised her to be patient and wait a few days, perhaps she would regain her previous feelings, so as to avoid this trouble. But the girl's attitude was very firm and she had to remove it. Gilbert had no choice but to spend two weeks of labor, using an electric needle and a specially made potion to carefully rub it off.</p>
<p>Gilbert regards this kind of work of erasing old words or designs as a difficult task, so he sometimes advises people to change the words into a bunch of flowers, a fresh fruit, a scale of vegetables, or a string of ivy leaves. Relying on his skills, he can cover up those words so that they cannot be seen at all. This kind of work, although troublesome, is much easier than completely erasing it.</p>
<p>According to Gilbert's interview with a reporter from a London weekly, "I have been doing this tattooing work for thirty-five years, and the most strange experience is: one day, a middle-aged man rushed to my shop and asked me to tattoo his entire will on his back. I used to think that it was a fable when I read the novel 'Jade Snow Leaves Traces' by the famous novelist Haggard, which recorded a girl tattooing her will on her shoulders and back. I never thought that someone would actually come to my door and ask me to tattoo a will. This time, the work took me two and a half hours, because the number of words was very large. This will contained a large amount of assets, which were to be distributed to several people in the future. The reason why he wanted to tattoo it on his back was because he would not lose it, and secondly, others could not change it after his death.</p>
<p>According to Gilbert, "The Samoan Islands have the custom of tattooing. Every time they have a child, they have to tattoo the child's date of birth and name on their (body), which will never fade until death. If you want to know who he is in the future, you only need to look at his body to know. A very famous international banker wanted to inspect everything in several branches in India. He tattooed his name on the kidneys above his elbows and instructed his subordinates on detailed strategies. If a person from a distant branch suspects his origins, then he only needs to roll up the sleeves of his shirt; he can prove that he is indeed their leader.</p>
<p>Gilbert also said that love and war are the two driving forces behind tattooing. Therefore, men and women in love often tattoo the names of their lovers on their bodies, or pictures to commemorate their lovers; and after the European war, there were countless soldiers who returned injured. In order to cover up those scars, they came to Gilbert to tattoo a flower or a few words. Therefore, Gilbert's business is extremely developed.</p>
<p>Gilbert's patching skills are indeed very clever. There was a woman who had an external disease on her cheek and was treated by a surgeon who cut it open and stitched up the wound. But that line of trace was still faintly visible. The woman had this blemish on her jade-like beautiful cheek and thought it was the greatest regret of her life. One day, she came to visit Gilbert and asked him to find a way to make up for it, not hesitating to pay a generous reward. Gilbert used his magical surgery and actually made up for it perfectly, as if it were seamless, making the woman happy and amazed.</p>
<p>Gilbert is also a beauty expert, and his wife gave him a great advertisement. Twenty years ago, he had performed a surgery on her face, and her face still looks like a peach blossom, as delicate as a sixteen or seventeen-year-old girl. At first, Gilbert had tattooed some pink patterns on his wife's arm, which looked extraordinarily charming. When his middle-aged girlfriend saw it, she asked Gilbert to tattoo such a touch of pink color on her face as well. Gilbert did as he was told, making this girlfriend seem to have regained her youth. She was extremely satisfied and spread the news of his ability to beautify.</p>
<p>Gilbert also said, "My most interesting customer was an old man with white hair in his seventies. He rushed to see me and asked me to tattoo a touch of pink color on his face. According to him, he wanted to look like an old sailor, looking healthy and ruddy. I certainly did it, and the old man was satisfied and left. My most arduous task was when an Australian official was about to go abroad to take office and asked me to tattoo a very complicated picture on his back. This time, I started from 7:30 in the morning and did not finish until midnight. One of my most difficult tasks was when a gambler had just won a big sum of money in the casino and was very happy. He came and asked me to tattoo a full deck of cards on his back to commemorate it. One of my most proud works was when an old gentleman came and asked me to tattoo a likeness of His Majesty King George on his smooth bald head to express his enthusiasm for loyalty to the King and love for the country."</p>

<h3>Java Decides to Send Xu Chengji to Participate in the National Games</h3>
<p>Returning to the Country by Ship on the 25th of This Month; Zeng Duancai and Xu Chengwei Together</p>
<p>Java Correspondence: Mr. Xu Chengji, who was selected from Taiwan, returned to Java from Shanghai recently. The Chinese Tennis Federation of Batavia held a reception at the Zhongyuan Restaurant that evening to welcome Mr. Xu. During the gathering, the matter of sending representatives to this year's National Games was discussed. Although the leaders acknowledged the current economic downturn and the difficulty of raising funds, they believed that efforts must be made to promote sports in Java. As a result of the discussions, it was decided to send three people: Xu Chengji, Zeng Duancai, and Xu Chengwei. Zeng Duancai is the singles champion of Surabaya this year. He recently came to Batavia with Japanese student athletes for a performance. Although his strength is slightly inferior, he is still an outstanding talent in our overseas Chinese tennis community. Xu Chengwei is Mr. Xu Chengji's younger brother, young and strong, with a promising future. This year, he won the doubles championship in the Surabaya-Semarang inter-city competition. This time, he will also be attending the National Games as a doubles partner. Mr. Xu Chengji returned to Solo early this morning and is scheduled to come to Batavia on the 21st of this month for an exhibition match to raise funds. The date of his return to China is set for September 25th. His younger brother and Zeng Duancai will also come to Batavia on the 21st if possible. Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Xu practiced at the Chinese sports field. His hitting technique has improved significantly, and he often uses extreme speed. For example, when intercepting a shot, if the position is not good, most people will take a step back to hit a half-volley, but Mr. Xu instead takes a step forward to smash the ball. This is a matter of "timing." The saying "a difference of a hair's breadth leads to a difference of a thousand miles" has become important in modern tennis technique. His serving technique has also changed. His "style one" involves slightly bending at the waist when serving, aiming to make the ball swift and spinning. After practice, Mr. Xu briefly discussed the tennis atmosphere in the United States. He said that tennis has become widespread among American children. Those who are thirteen or fourteen years old hit the ball hard and powerfully. During practice, they generally use "Edison" brand tennis balls, which have weak elasticity but are sturdy. Unless one hits the ball with full force, it is difficult to get it over the net. Under these circumstances, when American children hit a ball, they almost "exhaust all their strength." Therefore, their wrist strength will be astonishing when they grow up. This kind of training method may be difficult to emulate due to the physiques of overseas Chinese children, but it is worthy of attention in our overseas Chinese tennis community. The reporter hopes that the authorities of the Chinese Tennis Federation of Batavia will, if possible, restrict the types of balls used by its members. Any tennis balls that are light and easily moved should be banned. This may make a significant contribution to the development of tennis among overseas Chinese. Recently, when Mr. Xu arrived at Tanjung Priok port, he was photographed on the ship. To the left of Mr. Xu was an American woman. This woman is the advertising director of the Charteris News Agency, named Weiss. After departing from the United States, she and Mr. Xu were on the same ship. Their itineraries were almost identical, from Shanghai to Hong Kong, and from Hong Kong to Java. They often gathered together. Over the long voyage, it seems that Mr. Xu has found a foreign companion, a truly rare and destined relationship. The reporter asked Mr. Xu about this, saying, "The falling flowers have intention, what about your feelings?" Mr. Xu shook his head repeatedly and said, "This is just a friendship from an encounter." Readers may still remember that when Mr. Xu returned to Shanghai years ago to attend a sports event, he once had a crush on Miss , but this matter has now become history. This time, Mr. Xu's return to China from the United States has brought another romance, which is enough to add to the gossip. It is said that the woman went to Bogor yesterday, and will "take a plane to Surabaya, and then travel from Surabaya to Malang." What will become of her after this, is unknown.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Athletes Participating in the National Games: Itinerary and Record; Football Team Achieves Complete Victory in Chongqing</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airmail) The Sichuan Athletes Team held a flag-presenting and oath-taking ceremony at the Provincial Government at 4:00 PM on September 6th. On the 17th, they set off eastward and arrived in Chongqing yesterday (the 19th). The situation of the team on the journey and the results of the football team's matches against various teams in Chongqing are reported below.</p>
<p>Diary from Chengdu to Chongqing: On the morning of September 17th, the Sichuan Athletes Team for the Sixth National Games, a group of more than 40 people, led by General Leader Liu Shenzhan, gathered in front of the Minben Sports Teacher's School and departed by car. The athletes team was originally scheduled to depart on September 18th, but due to the convenience of the Superintendent's special car, they advanced the departure by one day. There were three cars in total: one for the female athletes and two for the remaining staff and athletes. Although it was crowded, everyone had a smile on their face. Everyone was happy. The three cars drove out of the East Gate one after another, heading onto the Chengdu-Chongqing Avenue. The weather was good, and the trees and grass in the fields all looked happy and vibrant, just like the people in our cars. When we reached the top of Longquanyi Mountain, we looked back at Chengdu. This area truly deserves to be called a fertile basin for thousands of miles, lying at the bottom of our eyes. We were solemnly touched. It was getting dark, and the car sped through the twilight. The evening breeze blew on our faces, bringing the fragrance of osmanthus flowers from time to time. Around 7:00 PM, we arrived at Qiuxi River and went to bed. The whole team stayed in two hotels. Before going to bed, the staff and the team leaders held a meeting to review the shortcomings discovered on the first day of the trip and to discuss ways to correct them in the future. The fatigue of the day's journey was relieved during the night. Early in the morning of the first day, at only 5:00 AM, everyone climbed back into the car. Today, the car was quiet, no one was laughing, and no one was talking much. Everyone's mood was weighed down by the three words "September 18th." We remembered two lines from the athletes' cheering words: "A strong enemy is pressing on our border, we will resist; we will recover the lost territory in the Northeast." Yes, we undoubtedly want to be warriors for the revival of the nation. As the car approached Neijiang, it started to rain. We silently let the rain fall on us, without moving or making a sound. The first two cars arrived in Neijiang first. When the third car arrived, they stood up solemnly and listened to the athletes' cheering words again, and then calmly jumped out of the car. Breakfast was at the Wan'an Hotel in Neijiang. In my opinion, regardless of whether it rained or not, we should leave immediately after eating, but the driver said we had to wait for the rain to stop, so we had no choice but to silently hope for clear skies. At 12:00 PM, the rain finally stopped, and the car started again. We arrived at Beimuzhen, crossed the river to Rongchang for lunch, and spent the night in Yongchuan. Early in the morning of the 19th, we left Yongchuan again, expecting to arrive in Chongqing at 11:00 AM. The hardship of the past two days was overcome by the thought of reaching Chongqing, and everyone was happy again.</p>
<p>The car with the female athletes was in the lead, and they were very happy because they had left us behind. They showed a competitive spirit everywhere. But in terms of liveliness, our car was the most lively. At around 11:00 AM, the car arrived in Chongqing. We tidied up our clothes outside the city and then entered the city. We contacted the YMCA and used the auditorium as our dormitory. In the afternoon, our football team played against the Chongqing United Team, and the athletes' team won 3-0. If there is an opportunity, the men's and women's basketball teams will also prepare to play here once. The track and field team can also have a competition.</p>
<p>We also decided to leave Chongqing on the Minsheng Company's "Minggui" ship on the 24th and sail directly to Shanghai. Regarding our football team, they left the province on September 4th, arrived in Chongqing on the 5th, and stayed at the Yuzhong Hotel. The next day, they moved to the Public Sports Field. Everything went smoothly. The following is a report from football team captain Zeng Zhengqi to the general leader: (September 6th) During practice at 4:00 PM, they had a temporary match with a mixed team. Because the team members had been overworked in the car for many days and had not recovered their energy, they won 1-0.</p>
<p>(September 9th) They played against the Huashen Team at the Public Sports Field. There were many spectators and the order was good. The field was too small, so the players could not fully display their skills. The opponents' actions were sometimes excessive. For the sake of their own safety, the team members did not use full force. In the first half, they took the lead with a score of 2-0. In the afternoon, each team scored a goal, and the team won 4-2.</p>
<p>(September 14th) They played against the Xiude Club football team. This team is the essence of the Minsheng Company's Navigation Management Office's Kang Travel Team, but their coordination was poor. In addition, our team's cooperation was gradually improving, so the match was not very exciting. It was a one-sided game. In both halves, our team scored six goals, while the Xiude team did not score any. As a result, our team won 11-0. This match was held at the Shanli Middle School field.</p>
<p>(September 17th) They played against the Huatie Team. This team is an incarnation of the Huashen Team. Although our team won 4-0 in this match, ten team members were injured. (September 19th) They played against the Electric Power and Municipal United Team. This team is the essence of Chongqing City, and the talents of Chongqing also have ambitions to defeat our team. Because our team had too many injuries, they requested a postponement, but the other team refused on the grounds that it was difficult to gather their team members, and insisted on playing today. Our team had no choice but to reluctantly agree to start the match at 3:00 PM. The injured team members were injured even more, and they had to be replaced from time to time. Fortunately, there were still many substitutes, otherwise it would have been unimaginable. Neither team scored in the first half. After changing sides, our team changed its strategy and concentrated its attack. Sure enough, within ten minutes, they scored a goal. About five minutes later, they scored again from the left wing. At this time, the enemy was flustered, and our team took the opportunity to attack again and scored another goal. As a result, our team won 3-0. Although the team members were beaten black and blue in this match, they have successively defeated the teams in Chongqing. This is something that the team members are very proud of.</p>

<p>The Chinese Tennis Association announced the income from the disaster relief tennis account yesterday. The disaster relief tennis performance initiated by Wu Xingya, Sun Linfang, Tan Jing and others was held on the 14th of last month at the Chinese Tennis Association.

Seeing the public's desire to help, the victims were grateful and the people who sought help were also thankful. In addition to the number of tickets sold on the day, which has already been announced, there are still some who have temporarily left Shanghai among those who purchased honorary tickets, making it difficult to collect the money for a while. In addition, there are some who returned the tickets after the event, so it was difficult to handle the matter. Therefore, it was not possible to publish a detailed list immediately. Now the money has been collected, and the event has ended. The total number of tickets sold was 4,739 yuan (detailed list below). All of the money has been remitted to the National Government Disaster Relief Committee for inspection. After receiving the receipt, it will be photographed and published.

<h3>Little Boy (55) —Original Work by American Woman Alcott, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang (Zonghai)</h3>
<p>One day, a Saturday afternoon, when a group of children came to play, Tao Mo said:</p>
<p>"Let's run to the river and get some new fishing rods back,"</p>
<p>"We'll have Tu Pi drag them back, and one of us can ride him over," proposed Tai Pang, who was most afraid of walking.</p>
<p>"That means you're going to ride, I suppose; well, come on, you lazybones," said Tang En, and he dashed off, later intercepted the poles, just about to return, unfortunately Xiao Qiao saw Tao Mo riding Tu Pi, holding a long pole in his hand, and said:</p>
<p>"You look like that bullfighter in the picture, but you don't have a red scarf, and you're not wearing bright clothes,"</p>
<p>"I want to see one; come on?" Tao Mo blurted, while searching for his spear.</p>
<p>"Then come on; at Old Huang's peanut patch in that big meadow, charge over there, Tao Mo, see how she runs," that always misbehaving Tang En proposed.</p>
<p>"No, you can't," Xiao Qiao began to stop him, he already knew that Tang En's proposal was unreliable.</p>
<p>Tang En cut in and asked, "Why can't you? You little scared girl," "My uncle doesn't like this."</p>
<p>"Has he ever said we can't bullfight?"</p>

<h3>Finance Gold Market Buying Spree Continues Breaks Through 90 Yuan—Up 8.2 Yuan</h3>
<p>The gold market continued to flourish yesterday, driven by preparations to cover short positions. Sir Ross's visit to China has led to much speculation. The selling pressure has been exhausted, and the price broke through the 90 yuan level. In the morning, overseas silver markets saw a decline in British and American prices by half, while Montevideo forward silver prices fell by 2 haos and rose by 1.5 lis. Exchange rate fluctuations were mixed. London spot gold rose by one penny. Sentiment was weak, but strong buying interest from major players squeezed the shorts, causing further volatility. Off-market pre-market trading opened, immediately shouting 78.9 yuan, with a lack of supply and even stronger buying, major players such as Da Da Fu Xing Yong Yong Li Yu Qing Yong Ri Yu Shun Li Tong Tai Chang competing to buy, immediately rising to 86 yuan. The Central Bank's official exchange rate announcement showed that both British and American rates remained unchanged, and the customs gold unit remained unchanged. The standard gold price was listed at 920 yuan, but had little impact. The market opened high in the morning, then rose, then gradually declined, with a stable situation. Banks released supply, sellers became more active and prices trended down. Sentiment remained good, and the market was dry. News of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's official exchange rates, with British rates unchanged and American rates down by .0625, led to a recovery. However, because bank selling was active, the Hong Kong market opened strong, gradually moving downwards. The exchange rate hardened, and briefly weakened, but buyers maintained support at lower levels, and there was a lack of supply, soon gradually pulling back up. Indian silver was predicted to rise by 2 annas, but demand exceeded supply and continued to rise. Major players took advantage of the high prices to sell. The market stabilized at noon. The situation on the afternoon market was stable because banks continued to supply. Although there were fluctuations, the overall trend was fixed. Indian silver was reported up by 3 annas, and after a slight dip, it soon rose again due to strong demand. Bombay Sassoon continued to aggressively bid on the shilling. The exchange rate tightened and gradually broke through the 90 yuan mark. Indian silver rose again by one anna. Long positions were somewhat relieved and fell back, but after the close, Bombay continued to bid on the shilling and remained firm, approaching the 10 yuan mark.

<h3>Securities Recent Troop Reduction Slightly Lower by 4.5 Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the last two days of this month's futures on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange. According to the chips, there should not be much fluctuation, because most of the long and short positions in September have been adequately prepared. The Italian-Ethiopian dispute, in terms of the situation, is extremely bad, but the door to peace has not yet been bolted. Looking at their tone and the rescheduling of the maneuvers, they are clearly unwilling to offend Britain. Once there is a detente, the market price will easily rebound. The 96 rule has passed the storm and is gradually becoming quiet. The goal they looked forward to has been lost, but the long positions are still watching, so it is not easy to quickly restore the original price of nine yuan and several jiao. Today is the last day of the September futures, and there should be some back and forth. Looking at yesterday's progress, the selling of number 48 and others was very strong, and the market price was weak at first. The selling became stronger later, and the more it fell, the more there was. Gold short-term futures fell sharply, with a maximum drop of 4.5 jiao, because number 72 and others were buying, and the market price was maintained by it. The market price continued to fall in the second session, and troop reductions fell sharply by half a yuan. This was because there was no change in the first session. After entering the market, the gold short-term futures improved, and the market price turned firm, improving by one or two jiao. The 96 rule was tired and could not be revived. The two sessions in the afternoon mostly turned firm, and each session improved slightly by about one or two jiao. As a result, the market price fell slightly by one or two jiao to two jiao, but the near-term troop reductions were slightly lower by 4.5 jiao. The total number of transactions was 16,930,000 yuan. The results of the increases and decreases are compared in the table on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit hundred yuan)</p>
<h3>Gauze Flowers: Gauze Deliveries Flood the Market This Month</h3>
<p>The gauze market has weakened, and the market situation is increasingly sluggish. Deliveries are flooding the market, which has hit hard this month. According to market sources, as of the night before last, there were already 5,100 bales in warehouses. Yesterday, more than 1,000 bales continued to be delivered, some of which were deliveries on behalf of foreign merchants. At the same time, reports indicated that the European situation was easing, further dampening confidence. However, actual sales of cotton yarn are still strong, and customer demand is still high. Tomorrow is the last trading day of the month, and there may be a fierce battle between bulls and bears.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster: Front-Month Delivery Gauze Falls</p>
<p>The market opened weak this month due to ample deliveries, falling foreign cotton prices, and dampened confidence. Recent months have been sluggish, dragging the forward months into the whirlpool. Taifeng dumped more than 2,000 bales, and Japanese merchants continued to sell, easing market sentiment. As a result, all months fell by $1.40, with forward months falling by $0.69 and $0.80. The afternoon session opened with the front-month market weak and the situation relatively soft. However, forward months rose due to short covering for profit-taking, but trading was not very active. Later, at the close, it was heard that spot gauze sales were not bad, with 1,000 bales being sold. Osaka's Sanpin gauze fell by $3.58. As a result, the front month closed down $0.10 compared to the opening, and forward months rose by $0.23 and $0.40. The following firms were found to have sold: Taifeng 2,250 bales, Xinchang 700 bales, Jinchang 1,150 bales, Shenji 500 bales, Changfeng 1,150 bales, Runkang 770 bales, Dachang 450 bales, Guangfeng 900. The following firms bought: Shenchang 1,100 bales, Xinchang 350 bales, Dafu 600 bales, Tongji 500 bales, Zhenda 850 bales, Renfeng 750 bales, Dachangcheng 500 bales, Taichang 700 bales, Tonghe 750 bales, and Xincheng 550 bales. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day were as follows:</p>
<p>South China Purchases Spot Gauze</p>
<p>Spot gauze sales are developing again, with purchases from the South still strong. Statistics show that all regional merchants bought a total of 2,025 bales throughout the day, with prices rising by $1.00 and foreign gauze rising by $0.50. The purchase amounts by region were as follows: Guangdong 1.55, Inland 565, Hankou 125, Shantou 70, Xiamen 5, Nanjing 10, Wenzhou 50, Changsha 60, Henan 50, Wuhu 30, and Colleagues 5.</p>
<p>New Cotton Arrives in an Endless Stream</p>
<p>The cotton market is flat and the situation is still firm, while the US and Indian cotton markets are trending downward. The production of Tonghua and Yaohua cotton is booming due to favorable weather, and the supply is crowded. Spot cotton prices are beginning to ease, but the benchmark cotton market has not been affected at all.</p>
<p>Zheng Cotton: Situation Still Stable</p>
<p>The Zheng cotton market heard that the front-month market was slightly weak in the morning session, but the forward months were still firm. Overseas, US cotton fell by 15 points, and Indian cotton fell. The recent sunny weather has greatly benefited the cotton fields. Ningbo Yaohua cotton and Tongzhou cotton have arrived in unusually large quantities, and a large number are about to arrive in Shanghai. However, market sentiment is stable as usual and has not been affected at all. As a result, the near months fell by 5 points and the far months fell by 10 points. The afternoon market was calm, but a certain company made large purchases, which supported the market. Trading in the market was very thin. As a result, the near months rose by 5 points and the far months rose by 10 points. The following firms sold: Taifeng 1,000 dan, Yukang 900 dan, Tongxing 800 dan, Xincheng 1,400 dan, Xinting 1,400 dan, Changhe 2,000 dan, Shenji 3,700 dan, Renfeng 3,000 dan, and Yuan Yi 1,100 dan. The following firms bought: Dafu 5,800 dan, Tongji 4,400 dan, Changfeng 2,900 dan, Yuanxing 1,000, Hexing 900 dan, Shenchang 900 dan, and Changhe 3,400 dan. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day were as follows:</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Prices Gradually Fall</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption remains depressed, factories are sluggish, and supply is very smooth. More than 800 bales of Yaohua cotton have arrived, and more than 8,000 bales will arrive in Shanghai today. 5,228 bales of Tonghua cotton have arrived.</p>
<p>Recent Import Statistics of Foreign Cotton in This Port</p>
<p>Recent imports of foreign cotton in this port: 1,500 bales of US cotton, 6,700 bales of Indian cotton, 400 bales of Egyptian cotton, and no imports of Burmese cotton. Statistics show that the number of Indian cotton imports from September of last year to the present year was 10,879 bales in one year. The net import volume of Burmese cotton in one year was 5,400 bales, it is said.</p>
<h3>Grains: International Situation Eases; Flour and Wheat Prices Fall the Most in the Morning Session</h3>
<p>The flour market unanimously showed a sharp decline. Foreign wheat prices: Chicago fell by $0.34, and Canada fell by $0.33. Market sentiment is that there is a glimmer of hope for the Italy-Abyssinia problem, and it may be possible to return to good terms. This is why market sentiment is empty, and prices have fallen sharply. Near-term prices fell by one point, while forward prices fell sharply by $0.35. The near-term's stability is because a large number of hedging positions are being held, so there is little small-scale movement. However, many large bullish positions in the forward months have turned bearish, resulting in a sharp decline. By the time the afternoon session opened, customers were unanimously waiting and seeing, and there was not much trading. It is estimated that more than 500,000 bags were traded in the morning, and only more than 200,000 bags were traded in the afternoon. As a result, the situation stabilized and prices trended sideways.</p>
<p>Wheat: Morning Session</p>
<p>The market opened with a sharp decline in near-term prices. The price for this month opened at $0.85 and fell by $0.04. The price for October opened at $0.93 and fell by $0.07. The opening prices for other months also fell by $0.05 or $0.06. By the time the afternoon session opened, it was still flat at first. However, because short sellers in the industry rose up to cover their positions sharply, and at the same time, flour prices also turned calm, buying surged, and prices for each month recovered by $0.02 or $0.04. The future outlook still depends on changes in the international situation. The spot wheat market: because standards have fallen, customers have not bid up, and prices have also been pushed down by $0.02 or $0.03. Shandong Yanghe wheat opened at $3.92, Yaowan wheat at $3.90, sub-grade at $0.85, Tongzhou Nanjing wheat at $3.80, Jiangbei wheat at $2.88, and Jiangjiaba wheat at $3.90. Fuxin sold 5,000 bales, Shenda sold 500 bales, and Xinda sold 1,000 bales.</p>
<p>New Rice Production Gradually Increases</p>
<p>Downriver Rice Arrivals are High, Prices are Hard to Improve</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Arrivals from all regions are particularly strong, with more than 50 firms arriving (more than 10,000 piculs of goods in total). Sales in this street are completely sluggish, and the situation is gradually trending downward. The Tianjin, Yantai, Weihaiwei, and Qingdao groups continued to purchase more than 2,000 bags in the evening, which slightly improved the situation and allowed the weak market to stabilize. Early Nanbang rice is still sluggish, except for small sizes. Changzhou, Suzhou, and Tonghou rice showed no improvement. All kinds of new japonica rice, downriver goods, and factory rice fell by one foot yesterday. However, Baige rice alone remained flat because it has not been on the market for long. For other varieties, such as Xin Yangjian, the initial decline was quite sharp, but later, with 400 bales being traded, it managed to recover slightly. Lujian and Xin Chuan, etc., were slightly lower by about one foot. Xiang japonica rice fell by more than one foot, and Chen Baiyuan continued to be mediocre.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) There are 35 or 36 arrivals from downriver, and the market lacks the appetite to purchase. Sales from various inland sources have entered the market, causing sentiment to weaken. The quality is also not good, and white japonica rice prices have fallen slightly. The arrival of West Xin japonica rice is small and sales are active, and prices are stable. Although the arrival of East japonica rice is not much, sales are sluggish and the market situation is slightly lower. Xin Yangjian, Tuanjian, Bushi, etc. are priced a little lower. Bo rice is also close to a foot lower. Baiyuan is flat and tired. Xin Kejian is slightly soft, and other goods are also flat and tired.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice and Speculators Dump Their Holdings</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation for foreign rice tended to be sluggish. Due to the easing of the international situation, prices in the producing areas have eased, so speculators no longer look to prices to improve as they did before, and they intend to dump their holdings along with the market. Other cargo owners also want to sell, and the market immediately weakened, and transportation costs also decreased sharply. Yesterday, the market opened with 1,400 bags of Saigon rice and 700 bags of Xiaowen Siam rice, etc., and prices were also a little lower than the previous market. After foreign rice prices rose, arrivals gradually became active. Yesterday, shipments from Mingguang, Yongjiang, Nanjing, and other ports arrived, but the market on this street was already weak, and sales in the northern ports were particularly sluggish, so the market immediately fell slightly. A total of more than 700 bags of early-harvested Jiang, Nanjing, and Hunan rice were opened throughout the day.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Customs Gold Recovers, Sugar Market Turns</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw customs gold recover and trade above 17.90, so market sentiment tightened accordingly. The association set the price for No. 14 raw sugar spot at $17.00, but no transaction was made. The price for No. 1 cotton white sugar from this factory was $16.10, a slight increase of 10 cents. The prices for No. 2, 3, and 4 were reduced. The sugar industry cooperation company increased the number of tenders due to the rise in sugar prices. A total of 1,640 bags of Five Sheep Yue raw white sugar were tendered at $16.95 and sold out. 100 bags of Huizhou raw white sugar were traded at $16.75. 1,000 bags of Yuezhong refined white sugar were traded at $16.15, of which 20 bags were sold. 2,000 bags of Dutch raw white sugar were tendered at $16.95, of which 750 bags were sold. The Chao gang opened more than 500 bags of pure cotton red, with prices ranging from $12.00 to $11.60, and the price was reduced for lower grades. In addition, there were surplus bags of Huanggang Qingbai sugar at $9.30, dozens of bags of Zhiyang sugar at $13.30, and more than 80 bags of light-colored Hainan red sugar at $10.06.</p>
<p>Hardware: Black Sheet Iron Faces the Risk of Running Out</p>
<p>Black and White Iron: After the Tianjin gang purchased it wildly, the market felt a gap in supply. The price of "plump standard" has been rising steadily, reaching as high as $8.50 per bundle. It is heard that more than 700 bundles were delivered yesterday. However, since the market's goods have been bought up, there is a concern that the market will run out of supply. Because of this, the market outlook is expected to improve further.</p>
<p>Weiss Iron is Very Active</p>
<p>Weiss Iron has been very active recently, with more than 700 boxes traded throughout the city. It is found that it was purchased by a can-making factory in this street. Purchases from the Hakka gang seem to be relatively small due to the impact of eastern goods.</p>

<h3>Thoughts on Reading History</h3>
<p>-- Tang Tao</p>
<p>The issue of revising the way history is read was raised a long time ago, and it has been discussed in various forms, but now it has been neglected. In the July issue of the Shenbao last year, Mr. Xu Maoyong advocated that schools should adopt social evolution history as a textbook from the beginning. This opinion is very noteworthy. Social evolution history books are still too alien to modern Chinese students. We only see famous phrases such as "Emperor Wu of Han was a man of great talent and bold strategy" and "The era of ×× can be compared to the reign of Cheng and Kang" swirling in the minds of middle school students. However, they are very vague about the causes and consequences of historical evolution. This is really not a good phenomenon.</p>
<p>Regarding history, I believe that it should not only be revised in how it is read, but also in how it is written. Books on social evolution history are certainly important, but the historical deeds of Emperor Wu of Han, Emperor Taizong of Tang, and others should also be known to some extent. However, there is very little in past history books that can be trusted. Take the privately written history books of the Han and Jin dynasties as an example. Due to limited knowledge and a lack of wide and extensive records, the result can only be a rough sketch. By the Tang Dynasty, Emperor Taizong proclaimed himself to be "respectful of literature," and the state set up a bureau to compile history. Although the collection of materials could be more extensive, the history books were written by officials, so they inevitably had to speak the official line from time to time. The trustworthy component is even less. At this time, everyone had to dig into unofficial history.</p>
<p>However, my reason for saying that history should be revised or rewritten is more than just this. Past historians have focused too much on sculpting heroes and neglected the power of the masses and the social environment that shaped these heroes. What they recorded was the history of a dynasty - in fact, the history of a single family, and in this family, they only wrote about a few characters that they considered important.</p>
<p>But in fact, history is not the history of a few people.</p>
<p>So it must be revised. The so-called revision is certainly not a random alteration of "demons and monsters." Rather, it demands more truthfulness and credibility in historical events. However, on the one hand, it is necessary to use new methods to re-evaluate and inject a progressive world view. In this way, the historical facts of the past can be connected to the current situation, and the causes and consequences of why the present has become the present can be understood. This is the greatest significance of history.</p>
<p>In the middle of the Qing Dynasty, scholars were very enthusiastic about revising and supplementing history. For example, Tang Chenglie's "Book of the Ji Han," Xie Qikun's "Book of the Western Wei," Zhou Ji's "Outline of the Jin," Chen Zhan's "Continuation of the Book of Tang," Shao Jinhan's "Annals of the Song," Wei Yuan's "New History of the Yuan," etc., corrected many errors in the old history, and the writing style also had many new attempts. This perseverance is worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>But there are still shortcomings: Although they knew that there were "red-haired people" outside of themselves, they still did not have a new world view.</p>
<p>Since last year, so-called historical essays have begun to appear in the writing community, which is naturally a gratifying thing. However, there are not many people who write such essays, and even fewer who write well. The reason for this, I think: First, the author must have a correct world view; second, he must have rich historical knowledge. The former focuses on imparting, and the latter focuses on understanding. These are necessary for those who want to rewrite history.</p>
<p>But such talents are hard to come by. In modern times, I only know one: H.G. Wells.</p>
<p>However, for China, I not only hope that there will be good historical essays, but also that there will be a Wells, a complete history book with a correct and new world view, whether it is revised, supplemented, or rewritten. - After reading a history book compiled by a recent person, I thought this so urgently in my heart.

<h3>The Owner of the Lovebird</h3>
<p>-- Zhang Yiping</p>
<p>The owner of the lovebird has a beautiful title called "Playboy." He is very satisfied and proud of this title, although people always call him "Young Master" in his presence.</p>
<p>In the third month of late spring, the peach blossoms outside the city are in full bloom. Spring is a season for travel, and people in the city go to the suburbs in groups. The countryside is sometimes envied by the city people. The young master has been a little sick lately. He is too lazy to even smoke opium, and his trusted servant Genfu has been sent by "Old Master" to do some errand. He spends his days confined in his study, playing with the lovebird that is good at serving people. He pouts his thick lips and imitates its call. When he is happy, he waves his hands and pretends to fly, passing the days with such difficulty. One early morning, he accidentally glanced at a peach tree in the corner of the courtyard, with red flowers blooming. He pounded the window frame with his refined fist. If Genfu were in front of him, he would have figured out a way to while away this sleepy spring. The peach blossoms in the suburbs should be crowded with tourists. The young master thought, grabbed the bird cage and held it in the palm of his right hand, and suddenly set off alone to the suburbs.</p>
<p>But when he returned, the young master was like a defeated rooster, lying listlessly on the opium couch, rolling the finest opium paste on the tip of the flame, and finally turning it into a lump of charcoal. The lovebird, however, was jumping and hopping in its cage, singing even more beautifully, as if telling people that it had encountered something very pleasant in the suburbs. But it is not a myna, so no one can guess what it means, and the young master who can speak is shutting his beak, as if he is annoyed, contrary to the lovebird. He smoked enough opium (without taking a single puff), jumped up from the opium couch, and hung the bird cage under the eaves. It was the bird he loved, otherwise he would have smashed it half to death long ago. When the young master is angry, no one dares to fart. He paced back and forth in the center of the room, bored and annoyed, racking his brains. He thought more urgently of Genfu. If Genfu were by his side, hum, this matter would not be so tricky!</p>
<p>Footsteps stopped at the door of the study. The young master mumbled a Buddhist prayer, but he did not turn around immediately, asking loudly who it was. He pricked up his ears, wanting to hear a low, humble, "Young Master, it's me." Sure enough, Genfu's voice was familiar to his ears. His heart blossomed like a flower, but his face was still tense as he asked, "Is the matter done well?"</p>
<p>Genfu slipped in like a chicken thief. After looking at the young master's face, he said quietly, "It's all a matter of life! I've been working on it for so many days, and I haven't gotten a single penny!" At the same time, he showed a cunning smile, "I'm also thinking that the young master's peach blossoms are blooming (that's tomorrow), and Genfu will serve the young master with an empty body!"</p>
<p>Genfu retreated backwards, and sat unintentionally on the other end of the opium couch. A thick fragrance wafted into his nostrils, and Genfu shrugged his shoulders. "Young master, the opium from the Lu family is really pure. He put on a flattering smile again. He was waiting for the young master to say: Genfu, give me a pipe!</p>
<p>But the young master was not as generous as he imagined. He raised his head and drew circles in the air with the index finger of his right hand. After a long while, he asked Genfu:</p>
<p>"The peach blossom stream turns a bend to the west. What is the place with those big trees, Genfu?"</p>
<p>"That's Yang's village."</p>
<p>Genfu looked at the owner's face carefully. He knew that after doing errands for ten days, the "Playboy" was a little horny. He immediately sat up a little straighter. As long as the young master asked further, he could make it up for the ten days of hard work.</p>
<p>"Are you familiar with that place?"</p>
<p>Genfu laughed: "Young master, I know the city and the countryside, dozens of miles around, like the back of my hand. I'm not bragging. You listen: From the peach blossom stream, turn a bend to the west, and you'll see two big trees. There's a row of two-room thatched cottages. That's the tenant of Master Zhu Chongqing. Further past there's a duck farmer named Zhang Laotou. The ducks for Yulijufeng Hall and Deqing Building are all bought from him. Further past..." Genfu spun his fingers, "Uh, that's the Lu Qicai family. He has a very beautiful daughter..."</p>
<p>The young master suddenly jumped up:</p>
<p>"That's it!"</p>
<p>He rushed to the opium couch. "Genfu, make me a few pipes, and we'll talk slowly!"</p>
<p>Genfu was waiting for these words. He leaned back and lay on the lower end of the opium couch, his left leg crossed over the couch arm. As soon as he dipped the opium with a spoon, he shouted how fragrant, how fragrant, the opium from the Lu family is really rare!</p>
<p>The young master understood what he meant, and he displayed a proud smile.</p>
<p>"Don't act smart in front of me, give me a pipe. But you have to handle this matter for me well!"</p>
<p>"Thank you, young master! Genfu pulled out his empty hand and patted his chest, "Genfu doesn't have any other skills, but this little thing is my specialty!"</p>
<p>He skillfully rolled the opium on his fingers, put it on the pipe bowl, and puffed it twice. Then he called out in surprise in the small tea table nearby:</p>
<p>"Oh, it's ginseng soup, I thought it was tea!"</p>
<p>"As long as you handle things properly, young master will be willing to give you anything. Tell me what method to use to get that little girl, the sooner the better!"</p>
<p>"It's very easy. Genfu said, making opium again, while leaning over and whispering in the young master's ear, "I guarantee you'll get her in three days, but, how will you thank me?"</p>
<p>Genfu used the tricks of a rogue, squinting one eye and staring at the young master. The young master jumped up impatiently from the opium couch: "You name your price!"</p>
<p>"Hahaha..." Genfu laughed like a crow, "I've been eating the young master's food for so many years. Is there a need to ask for a reward for this little thing? Let Genfu smoke one more pipe."</p>
<p>The young master ignored him and slowly walked to the window, reaching out to the window to bring in the bird cage under the eaves. As if he were teasing a child, he pursed his thick lips and called out. The lovebird, good at serving its master, flapped its wings, and chanted "Playboy, Playboy..." (End)</p>
<h3>Night March</h3>
<p>— Xin Zhuojia</p>
<p>During the Northern Expedition, there was a time when, to avoid a direct confrontation with the enemy, we took a large detour and retreated to a steep mountain. It was already very late at night, but we had to continue climbing over the mountain before dawn to reunite with our main force. Our company, with scouts ahead, was exhausted like a dead snake. Three days and three nights of hunger and relentless marching were like the giant hand of a terrifying demon, tightly gripping our throats. Our eyes had lost their gleam, our nostrils were emitting a faint smoke, and our limbs felt as if the tendons had been pulled out and then beaten to a pulp. There was only one shared, clear thought: to sleep, to drink, and to eat. Drinking water was more important than eating, and sleep was even more important than drinking water.</p>
<p>A cook, carrying a pot on his shoulder pole, walked along, dreaming. Vaguely, he and his load tumbled into a foul-smelling ditch.</p>
<p>But we still couldn't rest. And even greater nocturnal hardships were upon us.</p>
<p>We had no idea how high the dark, silent mountain blocking our path actually was. We looked up at the sky, which was black, without stars or moon. We couldn't tell where the boundary between the sky and the mountain peaks lay. Perhaps the peaks were even higher than the sky, perhaps what we were looking at wasn't the sky at all, but merely the cliff face of the mountain. In short—we couldn't see anything.</p>
<p>We groped blindly, as if in a dream, one behind the other, tightly grasping the heels of the brother in front. The mountain path gradually went from sloping to overhanging, to narrow, to winding... Sharp stones stood up like steel thorns.</p>
<p>As our eyes blurred, our minds felt even heavier and more muddled. If it weren't for the sharp stones occasionally tearing our skin and stinging the soles of our feet, we would have simply stood or fallen asleep without realizing it. The aimless wails of nocturnal beasts and the howling of the mountain wind, though constantly vibrating our eardrums, went unnoticed; because, except for hunger, thirst, and sleep, the entire world had long disappeared around us.</p>
<p>We don't know which of the brothers climbing ahead lost his footing and dislodged a large rock or something, which rumbled down into the bottomless mountain stream. The officers then angrily issued orders:</p>
<p>"If anyone can't endure it, if anyone is careless!... If anyone disobeys orders!..."</p>
<p>However, next: Another sound, two sounds... mixed with sharp cries, heavily and flexibly rolled down!</p>
<p>This clearly wasn't the sound of rocks falling!</p>
<p>The troop immediately stopped. And this sudden, strange stimulus caused a huge uproar!</p>
<p>"What's wrong? Who? What happened?..." the officers shouted anxiously! Because they couldn't climb to the front to investigate, they could only shout anxious questions from afar.</p>
<p>"Report: The road ahead is getting narrower!... Less than a foot wide, and we can't see anything!... We can't even find the markings the scouts made!... Two people have fallen down!..."</p>
<p>"No!... We can't stop here!" the officers shouted even more harshly, ordering: "If anyone is careless!... If anyone disobeys orders!..."</p>
<p>"Report—we really can't climb anymore! Our stomachs are empty, our mouths are dry, and our eyes can't see!..."</p>
<p>"Shoot them! Who disobeys orders?..."</p>
<p>Three or four minutes later, we were climbing again, fearfully, mechanically, and deliriously. Everyone's body was completely out of their control. There was only one hope—that dawn would appear immediately, that we would climb over the mountain top, reunite with our main force, and sleep soundly for a whole week, day and night!</p>
<p>When this painful climb had continued for quite a long time, and we touched the special markings left by the scouts—that we were almost at the top of the mountain—our progress suddenly stopped again. This time, however, it wasn't that people had fallen, but that something had blocked our difficult road ahead!</p>
<p>"Report—the front has completely collapsed! We can't see clearly how wide or narrow it is, we can't climb a single step past it!..."</p>
<p>"Then, what about the scouts?" the officers asked with suspicion.</p>
<p>"We don't know!..."</p>
<p>A very ominous sign suddenly stimulated the officers' muddled minds! "Yes," they discussed among themselves, "we should immediately send two messengers to report to the main force behind!... We can only stop here for now. Let the engineering company arrive and then find a way to open a temporary path!... Perhaps, it will be dawn soon!..."</p>
<p>We considered this an unexpected, best opportunity for us to rest, although we knew the danger was very great!... Our backs leaning against the rock wall, our feet went weak, and our eyelids came together as if attracted by a magnet. Our whole body floated up. The god of sleep used his black, large wings, to draw out our weary souls!</p>
<p>We had no idea when dawn appeared. When the officers ordered the squad leaders to pull our ears and pound our heads to wake us up, we had already seen our rear troops winding up. And immediately, a row of dense, fierce enemy fire resounded from the opposite mountain peak!...</p>
<p>We instinctively held our guns, opened the safety, and listened to the orders recited by the squad leaders. Because I had no cover, I hurriedly and clumsily lay down on the spot and began to counterattack fiercely!...</p>
<h3>The Suicide (1)</h3>
<p>— Qian Dong</p>
<p>The night is late.</p>
<p>Dr. Lan closed the door with a crisp sound, bang! Even the ambulance that had driven out of the hospital could be heard, with the rustling of its tires turning on the sound of the emergency room. The night is very quiet.</p>
<p>Dr. Lan yawned, frowned, and reached out to the five hundred candlepower light in the middle of the emergency room, preparing to see what time it was now? Suddenly, he turned his head, as if he heard something ringing, his eyes startled, and he immediately returned to normal, his face waiting for the elevator outside the door.</p>
<p>The elevator came down. A pastor wearing a black hat, black tuxedo, and a full beard hurriedly walked out. His left hand tightly held a black leather bag, and his right hand was holding a handkerchief to wipe his blood-red nose. This seemed to be his habitual action. He wiped it, and the big nose was temporarily calm, and after a while, beads of sweat appeared again, so he wiped it again.</p>
<p>He moved his thick eyebrows, put the leather bag on the bench, and a joyful, powerful throat sound rang under the handkerchief wiping his nose.</p>
<p>"Dr. Lan, they said the ambulance went out, and it's another suicide. Is it?"</p>
<p>"Yes." Dr. Lan yawned lazily again, pacing around the operating bed.</p>
<p>"Good, then, you," the pastor shouted excitedly, wiping the handkerchief again, "you have to be careful! A suicide when he repents is more profound than ordinary people, because a suicide is more able to appreciate his own sins than ordinary people!"</p>
<p>The pastor smiled, a smile that can only be seen on the face of an innocent child. And the voice was very loud, Huo Huo Huo Huo! Dr. Lan was startled by him, stopped for a moment, glanced at him, and then continued to pace slowly step by step.</p>
<p>The pastor felt that his words were too clever and could already elicit other people's surprise, and immediately called out more proudly:</p>
<p>"I remember again, I also remember, that countryman who was discharged from the hospital this morning, Dr. Lan, do you remember?"</p>
<p>"Which one?" Dr. Lan said indifferently, still walking around in his circle.</p>
<p>"It's the countryman who came in yesterday. He hanged himself from a tree next to Jiangwan Road with a rope. This idiot, if there were no street lights there, he could really achieve his goal. Isn't it? When he woke up here, you asked him: "Why do you want to commit suicide? It's so much trouble for people!" I remember he said bitterly that he was a farmer, and because of the flood in the countryside, he ran to Shanghai, and he also grew vegetables and worked as a porter in Shanghai. Now he doesn't even do these things, only suicide. It's that man, it's that one!"</p>

<h3>Two Startling Major Cases</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Recently, two startling major cases have occurred in the country, one is the major robbery case in Shouguang County, and the other is the major kidnapping case in Tianjin.</p>
<p>Jinan News: On the 28th of last month, the Shouguang County Nanhe Elementary School was suddenly invaded by more than twenty bandits, who surrounded the school. The principal and teachers had gone to the Fuxing Oil Mill to see the new machinery, so they were not at the school. The bandits tied up more than fifty people, excluding six female students, with thin hemp ropes. Before leaving, they fired more than two hundred gunshots and crossed the surrounding wall. More than twenty children under the age of ten were too weak to support themselves and were sent back. When they reached Zhuobei Village, three students escaped and returned. When they reached Yingzi Village, another student escaped and returned. It is said that the bandits' movements were unusually slow because they were carrying students. After the case occurred, the county magistrate was very anxious and immediately sent teams to intercept and pursue them, but there was no suitable rescue method. It is heard that the principal, together with the parents of the students, will go to the province to petition soon, in order to rescue them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Tianjin News: The authorities of the British, French, and Japanese concessions in Tianjin successively exhumed seven male corpses who had been kidnapped, strangled, and buried alive by bandits in Lixingli, Tongshenli, Zhuyuanli, Yongfengli, Taichangli, and other places on the 17th. The deaths were very tragic. The criminals in this case were arrested by the British and French Municipal Council, with the cooperation of seven detectives, including one female bandit. In the investigation, the bandits lured the hostages to the destination for killing through the women, and then sent letters to the family members of the victims to demand ransom. According to police investigation, this group of bandits has been active in Pingjin for two years.</p>
<p>These two cases are indeed very shocking. More than twenty bandits in Shouguang County dared to openly break into the Nanhe Elementary School in broad daylight and take away more than fifty students. The seriousness of this situation is extremely worthy of concern. Kidnapping incidents are often heard in our country, but there has never been a case of looting an elementary school and looting more than fifty people at a time. Only extremely heinous bandits have the courage to take risks in this kind of lawless behavior. Judging from the purpose of kidnapping, it is probably to sell them to various places. From the point of view of the situation, it seems very easy to solve this matter. On the one hand, the bandits' movements have been slow because they are carrying students, and on the other hand, several students have escaped and returned, so there should be a clue to be found. However, the county government sent teams to intercept and pursue them separately, but in the end there was no suitable rescue method, allowing the bandits to escape calmly, which is really a pity. If the authorities do not quickly find a way to rescue them in the future, not only will dozens of elementary school students not be rescued, but such robbery cases may be repeated. The issue of responsibility is even more important.</p>
<p>As for the major kidnapping case in Tianjin, the seriousness of the situation is also not to be ignored. Originally, the purpose of kidnapping is to demand ransom, and bandits will never tear up the ticket unless it is absolutely necessary. However, these bandits lured the hostages to the destination for killing through the women, and then sent letters to the family members of the victims to demand ransom. Their behavior is extremely cruel. There is one thing that is particularly worthy of attention in the occurrence of this case, that is, the seven corpses were all exhumed in the concession. Concessions in our country often become places for a group of bandits to do evil. This is related to our country's public security and is truly not a small matter. Moreover, this group of bandits has been active in the Pingjin area for two years, and the scale and organization are undoubtedly strict. Now that the authorities have arrested seven bandits, they should conduct a rigorous investigation in order to eliminate the bandits and prevent future troubles. This is what we most hope for.</p>
<h3>Little Song Under the Wheel</h3>
<p>— Green Leaf</p>
<p>My life and my nature are obviously in different boundaries; that gray life is constantly honing me, and youth is buried under the wheels, and time is constantly eroding my life. In my heart, in the rosy childhood, there is a kind of gold mine hidden, which contains the life aspirations of forest-colored apples, that is, the life of a bold and unrestrained vagrant, which can only be hidden forever.</p>
<p>(I am thinking of my wish, that there is a beautiful gold mine hidden, in the life of a free and unrestrained vagrant, I also want to be a drummer on the sea, a wandering pirate on a deserted island.)</p>
<p>When can I forget the crushing under the belt wheels? I also have a flying, unrestrained, and great spirit, which makes me have a kind of nostalgia for exile overseas, and that life will be completely in the rose-colored inside, a rough and simple life! I can pick up golden shells on the beach with a group of rough and tall vagrants, or drink heartily and sing forgetfully, singing this pink love song of the vagrants; thinking of the curry, a unique product of India, a spicy taste that can sting the tip of the tongue with new stimulation, and the interesting scenery of Siberia, where the north wind and cold always occupy the world; and then remember the durian and coconut with the southern flavors of the equator, that kind of sweet taste, which is enviable. Here and there, there is no restraint of the cruel belt wheels, I am a free little bird, and I will always miss this rough life.</p>
<p>Under the wheels, the souls of many young guys have been ground. Thinking about it, the belts and wheels will always be cursed and scolded by me. Cemetery, a burst of shivering and fear, and the bones of the white bones seem to flash in front of my eyes; it is the memory buried by the times, and at this time, I can no longer remember the demise of many young men in the long years in this gray life.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to listening to the pine waves of the deserted island and a piece of rare and beautiful autumn scenery in the life of a forest-colored vagrant; at night, watching the beautiful stars on the sea, weaving densely in the sky, like a group of children in paradise, at that time I can remember the simplicity and joy of the rose-colored childhood, and chat with a group of vagrants about the old feelings, and bursts of rough and straightforward laughter are embellished in our encounters. We can tease each other about our infatuation and the interesting stories of women. There is only innocence and loyalty here.</p>
<p>Speaking of stars, I am a little melancholy. In our narrow house, there is a window in the back, or a side door. Only on the roof, a small skylight is framed. On a night with a few sparse stars, you can see three or four stars inlaid on the skylight. One or two lines of green light shoot down, weaving in the rapid rotation of the wheels. The shadow of the wheels is gradually expanding, slowly covering the entire house.</p>
<p>But now, one or two sparse stars of frost flowers are also decorated in the black hair, and in the process under the belt wheels, my youth has long been buried, and I have never received some warmth and comfort in autumn and spring.</p>
<p>The heart is already in the ashes, without warmth and light, gradually peeling off like a rock over time, and the torrent of time has swept away the life of the vagrant's dream that is hidden in my heart and has a rich and golden quality.</p>
<p>The world under the wheels!…</p>
<h3>Ode to a Cold</h3>
<p>— Hu Si</p>
<p>Whenever the seasons change, I often catch a cold. First, my body is weak, and I was born insufficient, and the postnatal maintenance is not complete. Recently, due to the urgency of life, I have not been able to take care of the trivial matters around me, and I have not been able to take care of my own safety, so small illnesses such as "cold and headache" are naturally easy to invade, and a few days of dizziness and eye swelling are unavoidable.</p>
<p>It is natural to say that a cold is a minor illness because it can heal itself without taking medicine. People who have no money do not care about getting sick. Although it is said that wealthy hygienists advocate that a cold is not a minor disease, because once the disease invades the lungs, it is not a joke. However, for a poor writer, it is better to suffer from a "home disease" like a cold than to suffer from a "hospital disease" (that is, it is impossible not to go to the hospital). Because lung involvement is ultimately rare, and in times of poverty, it is a serious matter to spend money.</p>
<p>But it is not necessarily true to say that a cold does not hinder anything. Once you catch a cold, it goes without saying that you will have dizziness and eye swelling, and you will cry and have a runny nose all day long. It is dizzy to read books and there is no interest at all; it is also impossible to write articles and there is no inspiration to speak of. Even if you reluctantly pick up the pen, you</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>You must keep a wet towel on one side, wipe your tears and snot on one side, and wave the pen on the paper on the other. You must be careful if you sneeze occasionally; otherwise, if water droplets are sprayed on the paper, the work of writing will be greatly hindered.</p>
<p>For those who rely on selling articles for a living, spirit is an indispensable living resource. Once the spirit is lacking, you will be listless all day long and sink into a hazy state, so you cannot write articles and your life will lose its guarantee. The disaster of a cold for poor writers is that it is enough to make the spirit exhausted and unmotivated, and the brain declines, which indirectly hits the works and life. Therefore, the fear of colds by writers is actually no different from that of wealthy hygienists. However, "the rain harms the right to be light." If they suffer from other diseases that require spending money, it is better to have a cold. That is the wishful thinking of the poor people, and the calculations will not be wrong. --Of course, it is best to be an iron bull, completely free from dizziness and stomach pain. But how many people are there in the world, especially writers who are malnourished and have little rest, who can completely avoid illness?</p>
<p>What is even more annoying is that once you catch a cold, it will take several days to recover. There is nothing you can do about this. You have to let the tears and snot flow and drip constantly until you feel refreshed. You also have to let the dizziness and eye swelling be full before there is a solution. But for a person who has no food to eat without writing an article a day, what do you think this will do to him?</p>
<p>Because of a cold, it is easier to feel sentimental. People's tempers are as changeable as wind and clouds. Ordinary gentle temperament, lively mind, after a few days of dizziness and eye swelling, and a crying face, will be frustrated and decadent, and show a self-abandoning mood and behavior. Naturally, people are no longer children, so of course they lack the care of a loving mother; what's more, if they are single, or their lover is not around, the sorrow at that time will be even greater, and or kinds of ridiculous and pitiful actions will be made; or kinds of boring feelings or thoughts will be triggered. Is this unavoidable for literati with strong nervousness? I think some great writers may write famous sentimental articles in their cold times? This is not entirely forgetting and fantasy, I dare say.</p>
<h3>Malacca</h3>
<p>— From Long</p>
<p>Malacca, known as the "Ancient Coconut City," is filled with historical sites and scenic spots. Its beautiful scenery rivals even Jinling, famous for its six dynasties of splendor. One can never tire of exploring it.</p>
<p>It is said that the scenery of Taiping Lake is the best in the South Seas, but unfortunately, I have not visited it and have not been able to appreciate it. However, I have visited Seremban many times. Although it lacks the tranquil and poetic waterscape, its lush mountains and the verdant Royal Hill are truly worthy of being called "blessed with the spirits of the mountains!" People who have been to Taiping Lake say that "Seremban is one notch above Taiping." This is because Seremban's beauty lies in its verdant mountains. If you stroll along the winding paths of Royal Hill, you can experience the unique and delightful feeling of "when you think you have reached the end of the mountains and rivers and there is no road, suddenly you see a village with willows and bright flowers." Although Malacca is surrounded by mountains and water, it does not have the lush hills of Seremban. Otherwise, the mountains and waters of this "Ancient Coconut City" would be no less than those of Switzerland in Southern Europe!</p>
<p>Malacca has always been famous in history and legend. However, with the development of shipping and because its harbor is too shallow, it cannot accommodate large mail ships. As a result, it has lost its position as a major international port. Nevertheless, it occupies an important page in world history. Just from the historical significance of its role in connecting modern Eastern and Western cultures, it cannot be ignored or erased. In 1377, the newly rising Menjapahit Kingdom of Java conquered the Lion Island and Palembang Kingdom. As a result, Malacca became the only refuge for the Malays and established the Malacca Kingdom here. During its cultural peak, it was famous far and wide. Our country also sent envoys here. According to the Ming History, Zheng He's southern voyages during the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty (1405) included the official recognition of this place. Malacca was also the first colony acquired by Europeans in the East. In 1511, the Portuguese general Afonso de Albuquerque led a fleet to occupy it. The buildings from that time still exist today, allowing tourists to reminisce and pay homage. Therefore, most people who visit the South Seas always take a trip to Malacca.</p>
<p>"St. Paul's Hill" is one of Malacca's historical sites, but the name of this hill has changed frequently. It originally varied according to the name of the church on the hill. During the Portuguese era, a church dedicated to the Holy Mother was built on top of the hill. Therefore, the hill was called St. Mary's Hill. During the Dutch era, St. Paul's Church was rebuilt, so the hill was renamed St. Paul's Hill. This ancient church was destroyed by gunfire when the Dutch captured Malacca. Now, only the four walls and the tombstone remain. When we enter this ancient church, we see weeds and moss growing in the crevices, and we naturally feel a sense of desolation and horror after the war. To preserve this historical site, the Historical Society erected an ancient monument inside the church. In the center of the altar, there is an underground vault covered with iron bars, which is said to be the burial place of Father Francis. According to elderly people familiar with Malacca, the remains of this priest were moved to "Goa" in India in 1553.</p>
<p>In front of the ancient church, there is a lighthouse. A very sturdy castle was built around the hill. This is a Portuguese-style building in the East. The center of the castle is a storage depot, built near the sea and the river, so as to facilitate maritime communication. With this as the center, there are six bastions for protection. The remains of one of the bastions were recently discovered at the HSBC Bank site. The Historical Society is now excavating on the hillside opposite the HSBC Bank, looking for the original site of the Portuguese-era buildings. It has now been confirmed that the seawater could reach directly under the city in the past. The changes of the land and sea are truly overwhelming! Looking out from the top of the hill, one can vaguely imagine the scene at that time, with willows shading the houses and water surrounding the city.</p>
<p>On the small hill in front of the government office, a tree called the Malacca tree is specially planted. It was originally very abundant in this area, but it has been almost completely cut down in recent years. Therefore, it is specially planted as a memorial. There is an interesting legend about this tree: it is said that when the nobleman Parameswara was hunting on the beach, his hunting dog chased a deer, but was chased into the sea by the deer instead. The king exclaimed, "This is truly a blessed land, even the deer are brave!" So he built a capital here and named the new capital after the Malacca tree where he rested.</p>
<p>Coming down from St. Paul's Hill, along Ford Road by the sea, there is a long bridge over the sea. Not far away, you will see a city gate made of red clay bricks, standing alone, with towering ancient trees. This is a popular place for locals to take a leisurely stroll after work. It is especially pleasant to stroll here when the sun sets, especially when the Golden Shower Trees are in full bloom, with yellow flowers covering the ground. Enjoying the cool breeze and reciting poetry, the hard work of the day is completely washed away.</p>
<p>"San Bao Hill" is the source of drinking water for this area. There are many wells nearby, all named "San Bao Wells." According to legend, Zheng He once came here, and these wells were all dug by Zheng He. However, this may just be a legend. San Bao Hill is not very high, and there are many mounds of abandoned graves on the hillside. The mountain road is also very rugged and difficult to walk. There is a weather station on the top of the hill, with a panoramic view of the entire slope. Facing the sea in the front, the harbor is clearly visible. Behind it, the green mountains stand opposite St. Paul's Hill and St. John's Hill, with smoke from cooking fires visible in the distance and the sounds of chickens and dogs audible. The beautiful scenery weaves together this beautiful "Ancient Coconut City."</p>

<p>Zhaojun goes far beyond Yanmen Pass. Holding a pipa, she plays it on horseback. Directly facing the land of the Xiongnu kingdom. Nothing but Rongdi and barbarians. The Han family has already issued a peace decree. Also expecting that this life may not return. The wild goose foot once conveyed a letter. A letter sent to the Han King. Seeing the face of the Xiongnu Chanyu in the palace court. Her posture is unparalleled and her character extraordinary. The harem from then on received grace and favor. People are happy, but I am ashamed. Putting the pipa again is not similar. It is troublesome to repair it in the Central Plains. Later generations still pass down the Amber Thoughts. Even today, the instrument is in the Hui Opera troupe. Unsentimental. Abandoned for a long time. Longing for hometown, locked in frown all day long. Looking at the same moon in the sky. Always misty smoke clouds surrounding Guanghan. Then the fragrant bones are buried in the Green Tomb. The fate of a beautiful woman is not willing to die. Empty to talk about the four great beauties</p>

<h3>Me and Meisheng</h3>
<p>— Zhao Dan</p>
<p>On the screen, the roles I play are often very sentimental.</p>
<p>In "Night Fragrance", I still played such a neurotic person; however, it was not the usual intellectual, but a simple-minded farm boy.</p>
<p>"Night Fragrance" is a love tragedy. What is depicted in this film, just like its name, has many sensual elements. The protagonists of the tragedy are a flower girl, A Xiang (played by Hu Die), and Meisheng, the boy I played. Meisheng is in love with A Xiang, but another village girl, A Jin (played by Shu Xiuwen), is in love with Meisheng. Later, A Xiang is taken away by a rich young master from Shanghai (played by Sun Min). Meisheng loses his love and eventually marries A Jin unhappily. But in the end, Meisheng still sacrifices himself for A Xiang.</p>
<p>Young people like Meisheng are naturally not role models. But when I played this role, I was deeply moved by this pitiful young man. Because what this role expresses is not only the bitterness of punished love, but a strong taste of life's bitterness; hidden behind this uneven love tragedy in the golden society is a serious social problem.</p>
<p>I think: if the Meisheng on the screen is not played too badly by me, perhaps he will get some sympathy from the audience?</p>
<h3>Picking Up Fragments of Xi Shi</h3>
<p>— More</p>
<p>At 9 AM on the 22nd, the Shanghai Theater held a trial performance of the musical drama Xi Shi at the Carlton.</p>
<p>The play is divided into five acts, with four newly made sets (acts four and five share the same set), all of which are extremely luxurious.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Dabe, the general director, came to the stage twice to deliver "nonsense". Because the reporter was sitting too far away, he couldn't hear very clearly. He probably said that some people criticized the previous "Modern Lady" as a "civilized drama". What is the reason? Because there is no singing and no dancing, the current "Xi Shi" can be called a "barbaric drama".</p>
<p>Yes, "Xi Shi" is quite lively: there are solos, choruses, male dances, and female dances, thanks to the efforts of Mr. Chen Gexin and Mr. Wu Xiaobang.</p>
<p>But in addition to the first scene where Gou Jian sees the King of Wu, the drama has a strong Peking Opera flavor, such as the dialogue and actions (the costumes are ancient costumes, so there is no fault to be found). Someone suggested that if the Qilin Child of the Mountains played Gou Jian first and then Wu Yuan, it would be even more "wonderful", but this is a joke.</p>
<p>In the last scene, Gou Jian and others shouted to the sky on the Gusu Terrace: "Xi Shi's soul is immortal forever!" which received a lot of applause.</p>
<p>Is "Xi Shi" a success?</p>
<p>The play will be performed publicly at the Carlton on the 6th. Please convey Mr. Chen's "nonsense" and ask everyone to introduce more friends and relatives.</p>

<h3>The Future of Model Villages</h3>
<p>— Xiao Ang</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been a new trend and new development in the construction industry, which is the design and construction of model villages. The origin of this new undertaking started in Shanghai because it meets the needs of the Chinese people, especially the people in the cities, so in less than one or two years, this new type of building has sprung up like mushrooms. Now, in Nanjing, Beiping, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Hankou, Qingdao, and other relatively prosperous places, model villages are appearing. Indeed, this is the best phenomenon in China and the best opportunity for the construction industry. However, when it comes to its design, it is inevitably too westernized. China has its own system, and the people have traditional habits. If we imitate all the Western methods, the result will not be good. I have visited several model new villages in Shanghai. The buildings can be said to be magnificent, and the air can be said to be fresh. These are all aristocratic residences and are not what ordinary people need. Therefore, I will also talk about the future of model villages and the future of model villages that the Chinese people need.</p>
<p>(1) General Design</p>
<p>Chinese people have a bad habit, which is that they have no sense of unity, like loose sand. The design of model villages should use the connection of buildings to make the people living in the same village have a mutual loving relationship, and then gradually unite them. The Baojia system currently implemented by the Chinese government is the best way. The design of the model village should take one Jia (that is, ten families) as a small unit, and one Bao (that is, one hundred families) as a village. The residences of the ten families should be built in one place, and there should also be a small office, with the Jia chief's office, public entertainment places, and other Jia's residences designed in the same way. Then, in a suitable place, build a Bao chief's office, which includes the Bao chief's office, a public assembly hall, and a public hospital that can also be attached. If there are many children attending school, a primary school can also be established. In this way, the people living in the same village will definitely have many opportunities to contact each other, and naturally they will become more intimate day by day and united year by year.</p>
<p>(2) Selection of Location</p>
<p>The selection of the location is the most important issue, because the people living in the village are not the capitalist class, but the middle and lower classes of people. They rarely have their own cars and motorcycles, but they have to go to work every day, going out early and returning late. The means of transportation they use are of course buses and trams. The location of the new village should be in a place with convenient transportation. In Shanghai, where transportation is too convenient, the land price must be very expensive, and the air may not be fresh. Therefore, the area around Great Western Road, Zhongshan Road, and Jiangwan's Municipal Government Road in western Shanghai is the best. Another thing to pay attention to is that there should be small towns nearby so that daily necessities and food can be purchased at will. Within one kilometer, there should be small and large factories, because many women can also work during the day to maintain their livelihoods. The problems of electricity and tap water should also be considered. If there is no electricity, it will of course be inconvenient. If the tap water plant cannot supply drinking water for various reasons, it will be a very serious problem, because unclean beverages will affect hygiene, which will run counter to the purpose of building a new village.</p>
<p>(3) Design of Buildings</p>
<p>The residences of model villages are based on small families as units, so a one-story house with a foundation is enough. One living room, and of course the dining room, two bedrooms, one laundry room, and one kitchen. Its floor area is no more than 16x40. The color of the bricks is best to be peach red and yellow because when the sun comes out in the morning, the color of the house is very energetic and can also lift the spirits of some people. Windows and doors are best to face east and south. These are all shallow and easy-to-see things, but it is also worth studying their principles and laws. Flowers and trees should be widely planted around the buildings. Peach and willow are the most suitable for spring scenery, osmanthus and maple trees are the highlights of autumn, and bamboo and pine are the best in winter. The sports field should also be well designed. Tennis is the most suitable for amateur sports, and a small ball field for children is absolutely essential.</p>
<h3>The Newest Composition of Residences (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Written by Kenichiichi Shiura, Translated by Zhang Huangzheng</p>
<p>(1) The Function of Residences</p>
<p>It is commonly known that residences occupy the most important position in architecture. To express the essence of residences with more precise wording, it is what the famous French architect Le Corbusier called "a house is a machine for living in." The meaning of this sentence is by no means to say that residences must be built mechanically. Its meaning is simply that the purpose of the creation of residences, in any case, is for habitation.</p>
<p>In short, when residences initially arose as the origin of architecture, their primary purpose was to avoid the threats of nature. Today, this point is still the main purpose, but with the addition of durability requirements, residences have become more developed. Resisting the threats of nature such as rain, snow, cold, heat, earthquakes, floods, fire prevention, and moisture resistance is therefore of great concern to people. From this perspective, if one wants the human life inside the residential house to be comfortable, then the house must have a complete structure.</p>
<p>However, because the residence is entirely a machine for living in, simply having a perfect structure is not fully satisfactory. The design and assembly aspects of a machine are as important as making the machine sturdily with excellent materials. Therefore, in general architecture, it is necessary to know that the design of the layout and various equipment are as important as the structure. In particular, residences, which are most closely related to life, must be engaged in the design of overall control.</p>
<p>(2) The Structure of Residences</p>
<p>Below, I intend to explore these specific issues. However, for the sake of simplicity and clarity, I will only discuss structure and equipment. In general architectural structures, the main thing is to pile up bricks and tiles to make walls, erect beams on pillars, and lay floors below. This type of structure has mechanical differences from wood or steel-reinforced concrete construction.</p>
<p>However, today, in order to adapt to modern life, a more complete structure is inevitably required. Research in this area is very important. At the very least, it must be able to achieve satisfactory effects on the functions of waterproofing, heat prevention, fire prevention, moisture prevention, and soundproofing. However, at the same time, attention must be paid to durability, ease of repair and transformation, and low prices. Of course, it is unreasonable and impossible to seek one or two materials that can meet all these requirements. Therefore, multiple materials must be used to share these responsibilities, thereby creating a well-assembled building. In this sense, people will inevitably pay attention to industrially produced materials. Due to the shortening of the construction period, the price follows with the cheaper "dry construction." This is the so-called structure in which water is not used at the construction site, but only iron or wooden skeletons are erected to create the building. This style has been used a lot in residences and factories. Needless to say, dry construction methods still have many imperfect shortcomings. Undoubtedly, a more perfect construction method will appear in the future.</p>
<p>(3) The Equipment of Residences</p>
<p>With the structure, it is possible to defend against most of the threats of nature. Primitive residences do not know any means other than structure and do not make demands beyond the level of culture. However, due to the development of general culture, the progress of life, and the progress of science, in addition to promoting the development of the structure itself, various equipment has also been created. Heating methods in cold weather, nighttime lighting, methods of supplying and using fuel power, methods of water supply, methods of waste disposal, etc., make the entire residence a complex machine and organic organization.</p>
<p>Among them, the technology of indoor climate regulation has been particularly developed. Compared to the ancient residences with outside climate = inside climate, modern residences that are gradually estranged from the outside world have winter heating and summer cooling rooms for sanitary facilities. Similar to heating and cooling rooms, the temperature and humidity of the air are freely adjusted by various methods. As for the methods of taking temperature, using charcoal fire is extremely cheap; however, it is not hygienic and has many inconveniences and dangers, and is no longer suitable for the needs of the times. In addition to being relatively simple, gas has the same shortcomings as charcoal fire. Electricity, which can be said to be ideal in terms of hygiene and handling, has the only disadvantage of being very expensive and difficult to popularize. If you want the initial equipment cost to be lower, the cost to be low, comfortable and without danger, then there is only steam or hot water heating. In particular, hot water heating, the temperature will not be too high, and the handling is simple, which is most suitable for residential use. In addition to coal, there is also convenient heavy oil for fuel; moreover, there is also an automatic coal feeder for coal, which can be said to be very simple.</p>
<h3>Internal Analysis of Ancient Chinese Architecture (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhiyun</p>
<p>(5) Pillars—The pillars used in Chinese architecture are completely different from those of other countries and have their own characteristics. When other countries build houses, they must first build the pillars and then build the roof on top of them. However, when Chinese architecture builds, they first make a frame for the roof and then determine the position of the pillars. The wood used is mostly pine wood. The firmness of the frame and top rafters depends entirely on the force of the pillars standing on the stone steps. However, there are brackets supporting the top rafters. There are many brackets, and they are decorative. Chinese pillars are of unparalleled importance, whether they are temples, archways, palaces, or folk houses. Just as in other styles, the capital is the most important part of the building. Whether the pillars are as free-standing as in palaces or are considered part of the wall, they have no capitals and are directly connected to the top rafters of the rectangular roof that is pressed down vertically. And these pillars and roofs are the main objects of palace-style architecture. The half-burned wall does not have any architectural value.</p>
<p>(6) Carvings—In China, roofs and pillars are the main buildings; and their architecture is mostly brick and stone and wood. As for decoration, glazed tiles are used. In decoration, carvings only occupy a small part. In fact, carvings are the same as other styles. When wall tiles extend in, carvings extend out, wave-shaped, round, square, and carved shapes can be seen on the copper base of wooden pillars, but because there are no capitals, there are no carvings on the pillars. Simple carvings can be found on the brackets supporting the top rafters, but they are only decorated with strange carvings. They are also used on the appendages of inlaid circular halls. However, in halls and pagodas, these reliefs can be found under the specially flipped up eaves of overlapping roofs.</p>
<p>(7) Decoration—Chinese decoration shows a national characteristic. Oriental people all show a natural instinct for color, and Chinese people are certainly no exception. Color scheme forms most of Chinese architecture. The roofs are covered with glittering tiles. Yellow is used for palaces; red is used for officials; blue, green, and purple are used for other sections. The exposed roof ridges are decorated with dark dragons, fish, and all kinds of strange-shaped glazed tiles.</p>
<p>No matter where it is, painting some pictures is considered beautiful. Not to mention that palaces need to be decorated; even the houses where common people live also need to be decorated.</p>
<p>After seeing the construction of a setting in the mainland, you can know the national character of the Chinese people.</p>
<h3>Research on Indoor Lighting (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>The coordination of indoor lighting is indeed an extremely important task in architecture. The same house, the same arrangement, if the intensity of the light is different, and the coordination of colors is different, it often changes people's feelings and creates a psychology of joy or disgust. Those who work in it are often prone to laziness or inspire them to work hard due to the stimulation of light. Therefore, all residential rooms, factories, schools, and public gathering places should pay twelve points of attention to the coordination of light.</p>
<p>We should know that the benefits of proper indoor lighting are not shallow. In short, (1) it can reduce eye strain, because too strong or too weak light can cause eye strain and consume people's energy; (2) it can reduce fatigue and mental stimulation, because proper light coordination will naturally make people feel comfortable, and their spirits will be revived; (3) it can reduce the occurrence of accidents, such as in factories, where workers become tired due to excessive mental stimulation, and thus the use of machines is improper, and attention gradually weakens, and disasters are likely to occur; (4) it can enhance people's moral concepts, people must have good thoughts when they are happy, and conversely, they are prone to evil thoughts when they are depressed, so the coordination of light must make people feel happy and enhance their moral concepts; (5) it can increase work efficiency, and the reason is very obvious, nothing more than making people feel at ease and concentrate on their work. However, to seek proper coordination of light, one must have a considerable understanding of optics and psychology, and at the same time, one should have a considerable study of the application of various colors, so as to make the indoor layout and decoration neat and beautiful.</p>
<p>The light required indoors can be divided into ordinary and auxiliary types. Ordinary light should be peaceful and refreshing, making people feel comfortable without strong stimulation. The intensity of the light must vary depending on the application of each room. Auxiliary light can also be called dedicated light, because its application is designed for special working conditions indoors, such as reading, drawing, sewing, or other work. This type of work requires stronger light and clearer vision, so ordinary light is not enough to meet its needs, and additional auxiliary or dedicated lighting equipment is required. In addition, the points to be noted are: (1) extremely strong and dazzling light must be completely avoided, and any direct sunlight, light, and light reflected from polished surfaces must be avoided; (2) use white walls and ceilings and other reflective objects to make the light scattered so as not to be dazzling; (3) the light should have sunlight color or very light blue to protect the eyes. It is best to use milky white lampshades or sandblasted bulbs for stronger light to reduce its irritation; (4) the distribution of light intensity must also be determined according to the color of the object, because the light we see is reflected from the object. If the object is dark in color, it must have stronger light shining on it; conversely, weaker light should be used.</p>
