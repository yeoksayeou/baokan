<p>— （德國通訉）</p>
<p>德國雖受着凡爾賽和約的限制、但她在軍備擴張聲中、决不肯後人、尤其對於空軍的軍備、更見努力、德國到底有多少飛機、卽駐在這邊很久的人也不大十分明瞭、據英國保守黨領袖包爾溫的估計、說有六百至一千、據法國航空部長的估計、是有一千一百架、「希拉勒是否將征服歐洲、」一書的著者愛倫斯特·安厘·說她有一千二百到一千五百架、他幷且還說現在德國製造飛機的工廠、全部製造能力、一齊發動的時候每月可造飛機二千架、雖則德國受着和約制限、不便隨意擴張空防、她却另自想出一種方法、就是發展民用航空、而民用航空是控制在航空部手裏的、例如去年以來柏林與東普魯士之間的夜行特別快車都停了、却以航空來代替、去年一年、航空綫距離有六百萬哩、搭乘旅客計十萬人、載貨數量一百萬公斤、其航行綫的長度幾乎要與英、意、和蘭二國航空綫長度的總和相等、現在德國航空部長戈林統率之下、有兩所製造飛機的大工廠、卽「戎克斯」和「德爾涅、」牠們現時都在建造優秀的商用載客飛機、但在一反手之間、就可改製軍用飛機、這是已經試騐過的事、「德爾涅」公司所造新機「D二〇〇〇」型、可載重五千公斤、速率每點鐘二百五十公里、績航力一千公里、又如「G三興登堡元帥」號除了上返同樣的載重特點以外、她還裝載二十米毛砲兩門、司令塔一座、機關槍數挺、這眞是一架空中的飛行艦、</p>
<p>這類的飛機、如果編成隊伍、用二百以至二百五十架、來編隊從漢堡飛到倫敦去、則一次所投下的炸彈、就可以等於歐洲大戰期中、德機投到倫敦城的全部炸彈——八百噸、而其所受損失、假如是夜間飛行、對方的高射砲高射機關槍都將失其作用、自已的損失至多亦不過百分之十五的犧牲而已、</p>
<p>我們又曉得空軍之所以不易擴張、不僅在飛機的製造、還有更重要的是飛行將校、要能駕駛、能投彈命中、德國現時有素養的飛機師計有二千五百人以上、因其國內航空網的擴展、所以他們對於國內、國境上、以至別國的天空情形、以及各地地理形勢、氣候變化等等、都很熟悉、一到戰時、這些他們就可立刻變成優秀的飛行將校、照戈林氏的計劃、將來要組織三十萬人的空中衝錄隊、他的航空政策、第一步是竭力宣傳防空的必要、使一般國民都明白防空的重大意義、再進一步引起全國人民的飛行趣味、並且鼓吹一般少年的航空熱、在各中等學校都敎授普通的航空術、把駕駛飛機技術轉化成一種游戲、這個政策到現在已有了相當的效力、學生間的飛行熱確已被他的政策引起來了、現在他們大家都想從事於飛行、</p>
<p>戈林氏的政策不特對男學生如此、近來又向婦女界伸手、所以航空學校近來新設了婦女部、敎她們防空的專門智識、關於毒氣的效力、防毒消毒的處置法也都敎她們、此外還有種種工作、如燃燒彈的災禍務令其延燒範圍最小、凡負傷者、中毒者的臨時特別治療、包紮法、臨時急造防護室的建築法等等、專門科學家的工作、木匠的工作、也都要婦女們去學、現在防空協會敎育部之下、已有八百個婦女學會了防空的種種方法、卽此一端、也可見德國對於防空和空軍軍備的努力了滿載、誠他路所未見、甚至車頭蓬上、時亦攀坐有人、副手更攀立跴板、讓一座以位二客、車載逾重、以致沿途出險、故路局亟應設法限制、倘能統盤計劃、嚴密組織、將所有車輛、完全收為公辦、於交通安全上當更有保障也、</p>
<p>記者於雪後由蘭起身、天氣非常晴朗、車由南門外大旅社開駛、將出東稍門、軍警檢查行李、見車底置靈柩、遠自新疆運來、疑藏麝香貴物、但又未便啟視、盤察多時、乃始放行、旁聚觀衆中、一水伕將捲烟頭、悮置衣袋間、棉襖被燃灼膚、驚疼為之失聲、衆觀檢查之視綫、遂一致移集其身、見彼倉猝脫襖、烟由襟領出、無不輾然失笑、旁置黃河水桶、水面已新結薄冰、於此可見蘭州之春寒、并證檢查之費時、同行尚有特貨車五輛、車上各坐槍兵三人、與胸　黃綢字條之押貨商一二人、車頭插甘省禁烟委員會小旗、皆後我過此（檢查處）、不僅不停、反風馳電掣而先去、車中究載何物、蓋檢查人可一望而知也、</p>

<p>蘭州學校甚多、惟師資殊感缺乏、小學尙無疵處、中等以上學校、則學年愈高、愈見促襟露肘、甘肅學院、為甘省最高學府敎職員數量、有時雖較學生為多、但質的方面、則絕不敢恭維也、且有一人兼敎四五校、每週認課達四十餘點、超出學生上課鐘點之數、因此只好時向各校輪流請假或缺課、畢業生轉考國立大學之插班生、往往資格有餘、而程度不足、他縣來省投考之學生、大多先考一中、次考一師及五中、三校皆名落孫山、乃以假文憑轉考甘院、反多徼倖錄取者、院費每年九萬餘元、社會上不無批評、倘敎育當局、果欲力加整頓、必須破除情面、裁汰陳腐、否則决難收效云、</p>

<p>新新社云、樓允梅·徐傑·律師為歸化我國之韓人崔英心（卽李明玉）被捕案、昨發表吿各界書、茲覓錄其原文如次、</p>
<p>崔曲心君　跑旱船捕經過</p>
<p>各界同胞均鑒、按我國國十內之有外國租界、乃基於國家行政權之運用、而許外籍人民有集團居留權、初非因此而失却我國在租界內之主權也、而就上海法租界警務處之設置、又係基於上海法租界設置中國法院之協定而成立、按照該恊定第六條、凡在租界逮捕之人犯、除休息日不計外、應於二十四小時內送達該管法院、逾時不送交者、應卽釋放、又第七條前段、任何人犯、非先經該管法院庭訊、不得移送於租界外之官廳、乃上海法租界薛華立路警務處、突於本年三月二十六日、在勞神父路協成里、無端逮捕於民國十四年六月十三日歸我國之韓人崔英心、（卽李明玉）當時崔為解釋誤會起見、曾將入籍證書提示、要求免拘、詎該警務處竟不為理、且將入籍證書併勒以去、</p>
<p>法總領署　尚無答復</p>
<p>後由崔妻委任敝律師等與之交涉、致無效果、而接准該警務處四月四日蓋伯烈君之復函、竟謂巳於當日解交日本駐滬總領事署矣、復經去謁法總領事白利翁氏理論、據稱對本案經過絕不知情、雖承其面允查明依法辦理、然時經旬餘、尙無答復、不禁為之遺無限之憾、查崔旣入籍中國、姑不問有無犯罪嫌疑、絕應依照上開協定拘束、移交上海第二特區地方法院審理、豈能擅捕擅解、此種行為、微特危害法租界居民安全、簡直破壞我國主權、凡我國民、豈甘默受、查該警務處無端逮捕入籍我國韓人、已非一次、金晳之舊恨未已、（按金晳於二十二年十月被駐滬法領事署簽拘、轉解駐滬日總領事署、）崔君之新創又臨、似此任意摧殘、將何以堪、而此次崔君之被捕、竟為法總領事署所未知、則其情節之離奇、更異乎往昔、姑不問法亦為獨立國之先進者、無論依法衡理、法警務處、不應受駐滬日總領事署之一紙委託、而逕為捕交、甘自居於他國附屬機關、而失大國立塲、而我國究非國亡、而主權全失者可比、豈能蔑視若是、</p>
<p>督促當局　盡力抗爭</p>
<p>竊念韓人年來之樂於歸化我國者、原以不甘亡國之辱、而共情革命、冀共趨於光明之域、則我國應如何秉承總理遺訓、聯絡弱小民族、共同奮鬥、今竟不能為最低限度之居住保護、在我國境內任受異國摧殘、易地而處、人將以我國為如何態度也、敝律師等在法言法、雅不願多所論列、好在國內不無名流、於中韓利害定多瞭解、對此不堪忍受之侵害、應如何督促當局、為强有力之抗爭、庶亡羊補牢、不能為崔君個人求實益、而中法協定已屆期滿、於主張收回警權時、不難為交涉之根據、敝律師等心有餘而力不足、用將本案經過臚列以陳、尙祈各界同胞、勿以此乃崔君個人之事而忽置也云云、</p>

<p>— 臧克家</p>
<p>這地方有個古怪的現象，熱鬧在西關而城圈環抱著一片冷寞。幾處疏零的戶落支撑在這曠闊的地面上好似稀疏的晨星綴點在靑空一樣。士地上撤滿了破瓦碎磚，這是當年的堂室，地頭上枕著一個個土塚，這裏面亂擠著的是堂室中的主人。這樣陰森森的一座古城似乎只合天陰雨濕時聽鬼聲啾啾。</p>
<p>「長毛陷城，城裏人芽沒剩，男女老幼死者不下十萬人！」</p>
<p>城裏城外的萬人塚一共不下五十個，如果每個塚子裏埋兩千死人，那麼所謂「十萬」便不算誇大其詞了。最大幾座是在北門外，兩廂各縱列二三長塚，男居左，女在右，儼然男女有別，對於死者似乎田不到妨嫌，所以猶得比鄰相望。塚前各有石碑一，上面說明了這些死者總樣被詭計多端的長毛用聲東擊西法從四鄉迫來城內而一網打盡。而碑文的妙處不在此鋪叙事實而在其發議論處。其盛稱男子秉天地之正氣，能臨危授命，死不屈節；女的見賊已破城情勢險惡，乃心志堅貞，寗死不辱，懸梁吞金，投井墜城，其死也慘烈而貞節可風的句子應該發圈。這文章是事後作的，執筆人一定是名士才子一流人物，抓住了這樣好題目，當然要在明窗净几白日遲遲之下運用其開花之筆而呈才一下了。至于這些不幸的死者在大難臨頭之際，對死之恐怖生之掙扎之不暇，是否心中死抓住個忠義貞節，似乎頗是問題。說到自盡，除了為避免求死的痛苦外別無法解釋。</p>
<p>天下本不少貓蓋屎的事，一經揭穿，似乎大煞風景。碑文原不是為死者而是為寫給生人看的，「貞節可風」這一句巳說的明明白白，呌活人去跟死人學好。天下的男子全成了忠義之士，天下的女子全能堅守貞節，天下自然可以久安長泰而皇帝便成為一個人子孫萬世之業了。明白了這一點，自然可以明白「欽命」之碑所以遍天下之原因了。</p>
<h3 id="c170">過日印象的追憶 <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— 光淮</p>
<p>正是一九三零年春犬，我們一班年輕人就在上海整裝待發，大家都歡喜，——尤其自己絕對沒有資力去外國讀書的貧窮的我。</p>
<p>初次坐畏途輪船的人，總會感覺得一點不自在，好在我們坐的是頭等船，不是三等船，而此兩者却有明顯的差別。船到長崎，許多日本的便衣偵探衝進我們艙裏，東西張望，好像猛虎在那一裏找人吃一樣，還好他們沒有把我一口吞下去。這是我第一次到日本所得到的第一個印象，其後我與同學回國，途經菲列濱，被海關檢查員拒絕登岸時，這第一個印象又在腦子裏浮現出來。登陸之後，朋友們帶我們到各處觀光一次，無意之中，有個朋友為我們指出從前的中國租界，使我不勝驚訝。這驚訝是當時還未以正確思想療好誇大病狂的我所不能免的。然而後來它却變成推促我向更深刻方面去探索的一種動力。長崎之遊玩等於走馬看花，我們還須趕東京火車，以便準時在橫濱搭原船往美。</p>
<p>東京與橫濱的觀察，確是我思想變轉的關鍵。我們所看到的東京（當然還有我們未及看到的）的確是美麗的，淸潔的，橫濱街市亦是按最新式的設計來建築的。引道者吿訴我們，經前次大地震，橫濱變成一片焦土，然而為期不及五年，新的橫濱比較舊的還要雄偉許多。由東京到橫濱的電車開駛時間極為準確，上車的人亦不爭先恐後擁擠得一塌糊塗。</p>
<p>由橫濱登原船以後，風平浪靜，眞如蘇東坡於前赤壁賦所描寫的：「縱一葦之所如，凌萬頃之茫然。」在船上毫無所事的時候，我便開始消化在日本觀察所得的材料。我想日本的確比我們進步，它有美麗的東京與橫濱。到底這進步由那裏得來？隋時，她派許多人來中國學習應用技術，如紡織之類；唐時，她整批的學生還是跑來中國首都學習經典，她人民的裝飾至今還帶有店朝遺風。就讓我們不提起那樣早的舊事吧，在明治沒有維新以前，中學的地位還遠超過西方荷學之上，在國力上中國當時亦勝過她，何以為時不及一世紀，而歷史的程序完全相反呢？我對於這個問題必定要找到一個滿意的解答，否則不會安心。</p>
<p>一個人當然採取他最熟悉的方法，來解間題。我當時是唯心論者，並且讀過一個日本通的唯心論者所著的日本論。我想所有日本的近代進步是以號稱大和民族性為其致因的。不過日本人都短小精悍，大都有一點武士道精神，勇於冒險任事麼？然而於我這樣一個解答太過簡單。我又回頭想：精悍，勇於冒險任事，和武士道精神不一定是日本人專有的。不錯，明來倭寇勾結日本國海盜，曾不斷地擾害中國沿海各省，但明初中國海盜何嘗沒有冒險南渡去擾害南洋，君臨其若干部落，確立中國與南洋的商業關係？不錯，日本有武士道，但中國歷史上何嘗沒有江湖的義俠，而且我們有許多事實可以設明日本武士在許多方面都是直接模仿中國的俠客的。不錯，日本有可誇耀的豐臣秀吉的武功，然而它若與中國盛朝的武功對比，只是微而又微。</p>
<p>如果說所謂大和民族性的優點是生物學上的優點　說大和人有比較我們史好的生理結搆，那麼我們便會問：為甚麼在隋唐時代，他們還要來中國學習最普通的生活技術？為甚麼百餘年前他們還是崇拜中國，還視中國為優於它自己的國家？</p>
<p>就生物學所昭示我們的智識講，生物機搆的變化，是積漸的，需要久長時間的。未脫離動物狀態的人類不知道經過多少時間，才放棄其四足行動的本色，兩個前足才變成由走動解放出來的兩隻手，至於腦重量增加亦為長期從事於腦的勞動之結果。雖則在生物學界有時我們亦可以找到突變的現象，但它是積許多量變而成的質變，亦受時間的限制。現在的日本人絕不會比他們隋唐時代的遠祖，或百年前的近祖更具有特出的生物學上優點，因為沒有魔術能够在這樣短的時間改造大和人的生理結搆，可見唯心論者依所謂優點的民族性來解釋日本的進步萬分不通的。</p>
<p>我自己愈推論愈跑到牛角尖裹去。最後我便放棄唯心論的立塲，採取唯物論立塲去思索。但我當時所知道的唯物論，只限於梁漱溟在其東西文化及其哲學所提出的布克地理决定說，即機械唯物論的一支。按着布克的暗示去想，日本的進步是出自她優越的地理形勢，——出自她的良好港灣，出自迫得人民不得不勤苦奮鬥的磽瘠地質。但這種解釋仍留了一個大漏洞，地形與地質的變遷亦是長時期積漸的，假如隋唐時代的日本地質地形和現在的可以相異到產生前後不同的文化與文明，我們决不能說明治維新到現在不及百年的地理條件會變到可以使前後的日本判若兩國。一個大地震可以使幾個島嶼完全沉沒，幾個島嶼山海中浮起，或一個驟然的氣候變更，可以生滅若干人類賴以生存的動植物，因而改變整個居民的生活形態，但日本在這一百多年內並未經騐過這樣的震動與變史。假如地理的變動可以解釋日本的准步，那麽在同時問內中國的地理環境亦並不是一點變動都沒有，為甚麽中國還在新舊過渡期中掙扎？如果說日本的地理變動是朝優的方面，那麽同是地理變動，為甚麽中國的偏會朝劣的力面？</p>
<p>我當時所了解的唯物論只是非常糢糊的環境决定論，我運用它來解釋日本的進步，還種解釋不能使我滿意，目為它留下幾個不能以此解答的疑問。及我更進一步研究時，我才知道怎樣彌補從前思索的漏洞。原來未脫動物狀態的入類和動物同樣地受環境支配。他只能順應外界自然，他的生活完全受决定於外界的自然環境。但當人類歷史開始時，卽云人類能製造並使用勞動工具時，他便脫離動物的狀態，他固繼續受外界自然環境所影響，但他却能用自巳發明，製造，使用的勞動工具來左右外界自然，他可以叫外界自然在不同程度上適應自己，這程度不同係取决於社會勞動技術的高低，——即云勞動工具系統的高低，百年前的日本所以會和現在的日本那麽不同者，無非機器與科學在那裏作用。</p>
<p>談到這裏，我們不勝為反科學機器意識蒙蔽的現在中國揑一把汗！</p>

<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>在魯河關口的地方停頓了一夜，第二天，K．P．M．公司的火輪裝飽了貨物，傍晚便趁着呌做「新加拉惹」的輪船起行了。</p>
<p>一點鐘行十二邁的火輪，在旅客是覺得很是遲鈍的。更以魯河不住地又打了幾個轉灣，使渴想再見大海的慾望屢被遏制着。三年來被禁錮在寂寞的K．地，一和近代文明的巨物—輪船握手，那心情的歡躍是不用說得。更以一雙本來是頗為銳利的眼睛從低矮的阿答屋內被暗小的媒油燈光磨成近視，一看到明亮的輪船上的電燈光，便突然像把人從十八九世紀突躍到二十世紀一樣，覺到了新奇和歡快。</p>
<p>可是船一到黎弄漁區，魯河便被吞進了大海，而黑暗却罩住了大地了。從獅島海濱和關仔崅海濱（檳榔嶼）所威到的「海之戀，」而今又嘗味不到，眞是「悵然久之！」</p>
<p>在短小的電燈光圈之外，大海是一片的黑暗。星光在高空閃爍，對於光明完全沒有盡些微的力量。船里客人稀少，更有早早地睡着覺的，故寂寞越來便越深。只有機器聲轟轟然刺着耳膜，那不往推進的力量，令人欽佩！</p>
<p>突然甲板上一個荷蘭少年發出了高歌，又拉起了樂器。方想從廣漠的大海中領受人間的美調，而歌聲和樂聲却又停止了，繼之以舞蹈。一個像蜜月中的荷蘭少婦，娓娓地在荷蘭少年的肩頭響着細語，而寂寞的舞蹈又突然停止了。</p>
<p>環境的力量使全船歸於完全的靜寂。</p>
<p>同林君正整理臥具，突然一個棕黑色臉孔的中年人又鑽出來。他用着令人親近的和藹的態度，低聲地不住地和我們攀談。林君用着一個深於世故的口吻，和他打着交道。到末來我才知道這位紳士風而又兼「頭家」型的中年先生，原來却是要向我們宣道。林君還繼續和他敷延着，我却側着耳朶去傾聽大海的雄壯的吼聲了。</p>
<p>傳道者似無所獲般地走開，不羈的野馬便在心頭跳蕩了：幾年來年靑的小夥子從熱情的信仰中喪失了生命和幸福的，便一一從我的腦筋中飄過。一陣狂惡的感覺又通過了我的神經，我想「上帝」只好被踢在海底。</p>
<p>林君蓋在紅毛氈下打算着他的事情，我却想着躺在阿沙漢病院里垂死的「炸彈」（一個友人）。海從船舷邊敲擊着鐵板，我的心却被這世界的信仰所咬嚙。</p>
<p>船首照射着一片黯淡的燈光，我想信仰只好聽受船頭的燈光所指示。在大海上，生命是異常黯晦；呼吸也會被死寂所吞沒的。讓船的舵機把我導到我的目的地去吧！</p>
<p>傳道者的面目和娓娓的美言從我的舒暢的心胸中完全滑溜出去，夜船在黑暗的大海中鼓進着，鼓進若。</p>

<p>— 雷鐵鳴</p>
<p>峇魯村靜靜地，沉隱在灰暗的濃霧裏。……</p>
<p>天邊已經閃耀着魚肚色，一朶一朶的淡白雲翳，在朦朧的蒼空上移動着。寂寞而廣大的山野間，輕微的晨風習習地吹着，帶了一點熱帶的凉意。</p>
<p>椰林裏，榕樹上，鳥雀開始快樂的歌噪着，跳躍着。草叢中的野蟲也嘶嘶地，低鳴着，蠕動着。</p>
<p>「喔喔喔……」</p>
<p>雄鷄歡呼似的啼聲，尖銳地，劃破了淸晨的寂靜。峇魯村漸漸地聽見小孩的哭聲，女人的說話聲，老年人的咳嗽聲，低微的脚步聲。……</p>
<p>在晨霧迷漢的河岸上，漁夫稀疏的影子走動了，當太陽還未出來之前，他們就要趕到海口去的。一隻一隻的漁船，向着攸曲的河面划去，傳來　　　的木漿聲。</p>
<p>「嗚！——」</p>
<p>火油山上工廠的汽笛噑呌了，獅吼一般可怕的回聲，驚醒了整個睡着的峇魯村。</p>
<p>「叮噹！叮噹！……」接着，峇魯村高坡上鐘架裏的大銅鐘也響了。</p>
<p>「斯馬，快起來啊！汽笛巳經呌過了！」</p>
<p>「亞倫！聽見鐘響嗎？」</p>
<p>婦人們批着自己的丈夫，急促地喊着。剛恢復了疲勞的男人們，睜開了充血的惺忪睡眼，便忽忽地爬下床來。</p>
<p>這時，全村的男人，女人，小孩子，老人們都起身了；他們機械地，有的簪丈夫泡咖啡茶，有的忙着整理水果担，有的唦唦地磨斧頭，有的正在駡見子，有的赤裸裸到井旁沖凉</p>
<p>在這充滿了喧擾和生氣的峇魯村裏的人們，第二次聽見山上汽笛的長啼聲了。</p>
<p>天空浮滿棉絮般的白雲，東角上巳經隱約地，閃映着太陽的紅影。迷漠的薄霧完全消散了，四周，都充溢着淸朗暖和的空氣！</p>
<p>平板的石橋上，崎嶇的石子路上，行人是一個，二個，三個地，漸漸多了；在這人羣裏有强壯的工人，嬌健的女子，活潑的孩童，結實的老頭兒，挑着祖子的小販，荷着繩索和斧頭的樵夫，揹着鐵鏟的路工，……。</p>
<p>「加新，你早呀！」</p>
<p>「奧，是你！阿里那非亞。』</p>
<p>「利雅，加壯的病還沒有好嗎？辣椒吃太多了！」</p>
<p>他們無論男女老少，都彼此打着招呼，臉上浮現出親熱和誠意的笑波，好像忘了疲怠和勞苦似的。走着，他們背了峇魯村走着，各人走向各人的工廠，深山，森林，街市，菜塲……</p>
<p>火炭似的太陽出來了，它和那漂浮的紅雲狂吻着，美麗的金色光芒，陋遍了遠近的椰林，屋頂，草野，小河，小河，整個峇魯村。</p>
<p>「嗚嗚——」</p>
<p>土油山的油塔上，巳經冒出濃厚的黑烟；石子路上跋涉着前進的人羣，也在血紅的陽光燦爛地照耀之下，遠遠地消失了。</p>
<p>朝陽鑽出了樹梢，煦光慢慢地灼熱起來了。峇魯村的「亞答屋」頂上，疏疏的炊烟輕　着；女人們忙着燒飯，洗衣，拾柴；龍鐘的老人坐在竹籬下喂雞，幾個乳臭未乾的小孩子在唱山歌；椰林中有幾隻狗走動；小河裏浮着一羣花鴨。……</p>
<p>馬來人的峇魯村，此刻又恢復深夜一般的沉寂了。</p>

<p>— 柯靈</p>
<p>一這種年代，我們做小生意的眞是沒得話說了。他們大好老鬥氣，晦氣的是旁人。我是啞子吃黃蓮，向那個靑天大老爺仲寃去，好得目下街上空房子多着，學堂裏的屋，再是金窠銀窠，我也不租了。現在做生意父難，要不是家裏大男小女要吃口苦飯，我眞不開這樣的撈什店了，」</p>
<p>停了一會。</p>
<p>「就為這個事，學堂裏至今還不上書；一般學生都野鬼似的整天浮來蕩去，眞不知鬧到什麼地步才好。我們小的，决計不讓他冉進學校去了，所以我來跟先生商量，請先生收留一下。」</p>
<p>巨卿先生一顆心突突的跳起來，勉强矜持着。他答應了福店王的請求，縐縐眉頭說：</p>
<p>一本來辦學堂就是個胡鬧，小孩子一天到晚不讀書，就顧着操體操，唱山歌，成什麽樣子！現在是更加越鬧越不成話了。</p>
<p>那一夜，巨卿先生回到家裏，高興得臉上展開了久已不見的笑容。</p>
<p>趁着這機會，　　先生又活動了好幾處地方。並且天天跑出去打聽區立小學校的風潮有沒有擴大。</p>
<p>塲面上人跟塲面上人打架，照例是有第三個塲面上人出來「打圓塲」的。這風潮堅持了七八天，終於平息下去了。等到校長章少雄先生召集學生宣布即日開課的時候，聽講的學生幾乎减少了一半。同時鎭上的幾家私塾，却都像加了油的殘燈，稍稍有了一點生氣。</p>
<p>成績最好的是巨卿先生。這一塲風潮的結果，竟使他增加了六七個學生，大家曳長聲音念起書來，那一片書聲居然有點鬧烘烘的樣子了。</p>
<p>二月初，簷頭屋角都飄着做夢似的東風。</p>
<p>跟着暖起來的天氣，巨卿先生的心裏彷彿也有些「萬象回春」了。比起從前，現狀雖說還有許多缺撼，他巳經感到了滿足。</p>

<p>凡是能够雄飛世界的任何民族，都有他的兩翼：其一是優越的精神力，又其一是優越的物質力。所謂精神力，就是智力，而物質力則包含體力，財力，物力主要素。目下的羣力主義者，都該重物質力而輕忽精神力，這是很大錯誤。因為如果沒有精神力做主宰，那就縱有雄壯的體力，富厚的財力，衆多的物力，都會陷於無統制無組織無管理的狀態，一旦要把他用在大規模的民族上面，便會發覺這種物質力，只是一盤散沙不是團結凝固的士敏士，只好讓人家各個擊破了。</p>
<p>增進精力的唯一方法，是求知，要求知，就要讀書。書是固有文化的總和，我們讀書可收溫故而知新的效果，書是西方文化的結晶，我們讀書可以得到迎頭趕上去的階梯。我們民族之所以不能雄飛於世界，甚且連生存都受着很大的威脅不讀書，不求知，實是一個最大的原因。不讀書，不求知，智慧的光照不到身邊的危險，精神的力不能統制自己的物質，那就難怪中國會成為外國人的次殖民了現在我们請大家來參加讀書運動，其最大的目的，就是希望大家能够多準備點有用的知識，來統制組織管理自己的物質力，來爭取我們民族的生存。</p>
<p>一部分的人們，都以為現在國家民族的需要，是飛機巨艦大砲炸彈，决不是不值一文錢的書。其實飛機巨艦大砲炸彈固然有用，而製造和使用這飛機巨艦大砲炸彈的學術就更有用，如沒有製造飛機巨艦大砲炸彈的智識，試問飛機巨艦大砲炸彈何從產生，如果沒有利用飛機巨艦大砲炸彈的智識，那就縱有飛機巨艦大砲炸彈，又有什麼用處？由此豈不可見屬於精神的智識力，實比屬於物質的體力財力物力都更重要麼？</p>
<p>法國人不是說他的收回亞爾薩斯羅蘭二州是小學敎師的力量麼？小學敎師手裏的敎科書都可做收回失地的法寶，那小學敎科書以外的書豈不有更偉大的效果？然則我們為什麼不也趕緊讀書求知呢？</p>
<p>親愛的國人，請移消耗於無的時間來讀書，移消耗於無用的金錢來買書罷，我們要知道用多數不學無術的人，來組織國家，是比用朽索來馭六馬更危險，現在不學無術的人遍於全國，我們靠什麼來爭取民族的生存呢。</p>
<p>我們敢斷言：不論是要充實人民的生活也好，是要發展國民的獨濟也好，是要爭取民族的生存也好、都和學術的興衰有密切的關係，而學術的興衰又和一般肯不肯讀書求知成為不斷的一環，所以讀書就是我們中國此時此地的需要。</p>
<h3 id="c176">怎樣讀書 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— 樊仲雲</p>
<p>「怎樣讀書」是個最普通不過的題目，好像「怎樣吃飯」一樣，凡是讀書的人大概沒有不知道的。例如眼到，口到，心到，手到，那已甚老生常談，用不着再說，卽是怎樣寫筆記，怎樣加綫條記號等等，也都是衆所共知的。所以這裏，還是寫一點我個人怎樣讀書的經驗罷。</p>
<p>說也慚愧，我竟沒有系地讀過什麼書，這原因的一半由於尚是讀時的年齡，就須為生活而勞動，沒有整叚的時間；一半則因為也沒有如古人那樣坦頭研究的精神。我的讀書，大抵是隨自已一時的興味，或者經了友朋的介紹而始動乎的。所以普通的書，我都瀏覽一過便算了事，只有覽得這本書在瀏覽之後值得重讀的，的是不僅每叚擇其要點，加錢加圈，或者加點，且於書上將每叚要點，也摘記下來。因為要摘取每叚的要旨，使我對於所讀的書，不得不有仔細的思素。因了這樣一再的思索，於是全書讀完以後，對于大體內容，乃到一個相當概念；待至作文記了起來，要想以為參考時，把那讀過的書翻開，一看眉上所摘的要旨，便可狠容易的找到我所需要的材料。我覺得這個方法，似乎比寫剳記好，因為省時間，當然，這是就我個人以言，倘然時問比較充分的，那末多用一分工夫，總是比偷懶的辦法有益的，</p>
<p>我的讀書方法，因為是在書上打圈點記號，再加眉批，摘取要旨，所以遇到是向他人或聞書館借來的圖書時，便感到不可能，所以雖然書已看過，往往為了摘取要點，自已再去買一本來，但是因為業已看過，結果對于這些標記的工作，却往往從此擱了下來。因為這本書旣未仔細讀過，迨過了幾時，再去翻閱，遂往往有狠生疏如未讀過樣的地方。這使我感到書單是讀是不够的，讀了之後，必定要有思索及摘記的工作，那末這本書的內容，才可給我受用。說起來這還是眼到，心到，手到的老法子，不過我是自己這樣由經騐而認識這老法子的。</p>
<p>還有一點經騐，我覺得如讀史地，甚至如閱報章雜誌，最好同時能備一本地圖。往往因地圖的帮助，使我對于事實的理解與記憶，更為容易。尤其是讀歷史，要記往古代地名，頗費心力，倘能對着地圖，以今證古，就很容易記着了。</p>
<p>又因服務書店之故，乃得時時到圖書室中，翻閱我所要讀的書。自然讀了多少，但是却給我認識了學海之浩汗無涯，有不少的書，從目錄序文的翻閱，到底也得了個大概。因此之故，使我覺得對于靑年子弟，讀書的機會也是很要緊的。現在，圖書館已沒有從前那機可以自由出入了，但為了要擴大對於圖畫的認識，於是只好常到中外的書店中翻閱圖書，這成為如看電影樣的一種消遣，有時遇到好書，便估量我的經濟買了回來。然而遇到囊中空空的時候，雖有書，只好戀戀不捨的走開，那時在盛情上可眞難受呢。</p>
<p>至如讀外國文，我的經騐大概是這樣：因為我對於英文日文都是出于自修，而我當時的目的，因旨在看書，所以發音怎樣，我是不大顧到的，甚至作文，我也置之不顧，我的用意，只求能明白文句的眞義。但欲明白眞正的意義，單是認識生字，講解句子，還是不够，我便藉此來練習我的翻譯，這使我對於一字一句都有仔細思素尋味的祝會。我所讀的，大抵是英文而有日文譯註的文學作品，因此，我得由日文以解釋英文，由英文以理會日文，從兩方面的比較對照，認取其意義所在。我頗想以此方法，自修德文，但是上了三十的年紀，雖然時間可以抽得出來，而少年時那種讀書的精神却大减了，結果德文還是不得其門而入。由此可知讀書在「怎樣讀書」以來，還得有讀書的精神才是。</p>
<h3 id="c177">怎樣研究哲學 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— 葉靑</p>
<p>讀書運動特刊要我寫一篇關於研究哲學的短文。我向來主張研究，尤主張研究哲學。而這個題目我並沒有寫過。所以不妨將就這個機會給研究哲學的人提供一種方法上的意見。</p>
<p>我覺得研究哲學一句話，包含有兩種意思。一種是把旣有的哲學弄了解，一種是建立個新的哲學。前者為預備的工作，後者為開拓的工作。眞正的說起來，還要後者纔配得上說是研究哲學，前者不過學習哲學或取得哲學知識而已。</p>
<p>因此，在哲學的研究方法上，也不分為兩種來說，先從第一種說起。</p>
<p>（一）讀哲學概論。這是必需的。不這樣，連哲學是甚麼東西，你都不知道。哲學概論就是吿訴你以一般的哲學知識的。所以先應該了解這個。</p>
<p>（二）讀哲學史。哲學是分了派的，也是分了家的。研究哲學的人對於過去的各派各家的學說，不能不知道一下。何說哲學的本身就是這派那派，這家那家的理論，根本沒有公共的一定內容呢？</p>
<p>（三）哲學。從哲學史中選出你認為正確的一派一家的哲學來談。凡屬該派該家的哲學書，盡量搜羅。須明白它的起源，發展和消滅。期能精通一家之言。</p>
<p>（四）甚麼是正確的哲學？我以為即合乎科學的哲華。甚麼是和乎科學的哲學呢？在我的張榮蓀哲學批判一書（在辛墾書店出版），的第一編Ⅱ上，有明白而詳細的說明，這裏沒有篇幅提及了。</p>
<p>以後說第二種研究方法。</p>
<p>（一）要創立一種哲學，首先須注意哲學的歷史的發展。一家哲學是一套邏輯，一派哲學是一套邏輯，一部哲學史也是一套邏輯。而創立　種哲學，則是哲學史這套輯邏的展開。那末，不懂哲學的發展怎能展開它的邏輯呢？</p>
<p>（二）其實這只是吿訴我們以努力之所在。怎樣展　邏輯呢？我以為只有熟讀哲學史做深思的工夫。所以方法不是別的，在這裏不外這三個：第一，思維；第二，思維；第三思維。</p>
<p>（三）怎樣的思維呢？我以為要對哲學的發展，作整個的歷史的邏輯的展望。這在最初是要從一時代一時代做起的。方法是把握各時代的特徵。而在這中間，須時時注章整個的綫索。要這樣，纔能明白這套邏輯　到我們現代時有甚麼問題須得我們去解决。</p>
<p>（四）怎樣解决呢？訴諸科學。即使你已從思維上獲得了解决問題的恢復，亦必求證於科學。在今天，離開科學是不能有哲學理論的。單純的思維，由哲學的思維來建立一個哲學的時代是過去了。</p>
<p>（五）甚麼科學呢？在本處論和宇宙論方面，是自然科學；在人生論方面是社會科學，而在前者中，物理和生物學最為重要，在後者中，經濟學和社會學最為重要。這自然不是說其他的學不必注意，哲學應該用科學作建築它的材料。</p>
<p>（六）怎樣研究科學呢？不是科學家的研究，即技術的研究，而應該採取哲學家的方式。換　句話說，就是對科學作純理論的探討。因此要特別注意富有理論意味的科學發現，如原子論，電子論，量子論，相對論，進化論，等。</p>
<p>（七）向且哲學在今天，我以為根本是與科學統一的，即科學由叙述階段，說明階段而達於最高的理論階段之總論或結論的形態。哲學的哲學已經消滅了，只有科學的哲學（詳見我的哲學到何處去一書，亦在辛懇書店出版。）研究哲學就是認識它，闡明它和發展它。</p>
<p>以上兩種方法，都是特深的方法，與研究一般的知識科目相同。這在我的怎樣研究理論一文上，說得很詳細。那篇文章在辛墾書店總代售的二十世紀第二卷第二期中，不贅述了。</p>
<p>最後聲明一句，因為篇幅的關係，不能盡言，同時也有不盡意，對於哲學的方法，以後當另文論究。但可斷言的，這些短話，可以供人們的參考。</p>
<h3 id="c178">我的讀書經驗 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— 蔡元培</p>
<p>我自十餘歲起，就開始讀書；讀到現在，將滿六十年了：中間除大病或其他特別原因外，幾乎沒有一日不讀點書的，然而我沒有什麼成就，這是讀書不得法的綠故。我把不得法的槪略寫出來，可以作前車之鑒。</p>
<p>我的不得法第一是不能專心：我初讀書的時候，讀的都是舊書，不外乎考據詞章兩類。我的嗜好，在考據方面，是偏於詁訓及哲理的，對於典章名物，是不大耐煩的；在詞章上，是偏於散文的，對於駢文及詩詞，是不大執心的。然而以一物不知為恥，種種都讀；並且算學書也讀，醫學書也讀，都沒有讀通。所以我曾經想編一部說文聲系義證，又想編一本公羊春秋大義，都沒有成書。所為文辭，不但駢文詩詞，沒有一首可存的，就是散文也太平凡了。到了四十歲以後我始學德文，後來又學法文，我都沒有好好兒做那記生字練文法的苦工，而就是生吞活剝的看書，所以至今不能寫一篇合格的文章，作一回短期的演說。在德國進大學聽講以後，哲學史、文學史，文明史，心理學，美學，美術史，民族學統統去聽，那時候這幾類的參考書，也就亂讀起來了。後來雖勉自收縮，以美學與美術史為主，輔以民族學；然而他類的書終不能割愛，所以想譯一本美學，想編一部此較的民族學，也都沒有成書。</p>
<p>我的不得法，第二是不能勤筆：我的讀書，本來抱一種利己主義，就是書裏面的短處，我不大去搜尋他，我正注意於我所認為有用的或可愛的材料。這本來不算壞，但是我的壞處，就是我雖讀的時候注意於這幾點，但往往為速讀起見，無暇把這幾點摘抄出來，或在書上做一點特別的記號，若是有時候想起來，除了德文書檢目特詳，尚易檢尋外，其他的書、幾乎不容易尋到了。我國現雖有人編「索引」「引得」等等，又專門的辭典，也逐漸增加，尋檢自然較易，但各人有各自的注意點，普通的檢目，斷不能如自己記別的方便。我嘗見胡適之先生有一個時期，出門時常常携一兩本綫裝書，在舟車上或其他忙裏偷閒時翻閱，見到有用的材料，就折角或以鉛筆作記號。我想他回家後或者尚有摘抄的手續。我記得有一部筆記，說王漁洋讀書時，遇有新雋的典故或詞句，就用紙條抄出，貼在書齋壁上，時時覽讀，熟了就揭去，換上新得的。所以他記得很多。這雖是文學上的把戲，但科學上何嘗不可以仿作呢？我因從來懶得動筆，所以沒有成就</p>
<p>我的讀書的短處，我已經經騐了許多的不方便，特地寫出來，望讀者鑒於我的短處，第一能專心，第二能動筆，這一定有許多成效。</p>
<h3 id="c179">怎樣研究經濟 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— 蔣白</p>
<p>一·何以要研究經濟？</p>
<p>「經濟「這個名詞，在社會科學事邊，要算佔極重要的位置了。原始社會呢，那些末開化的民族，或是漁獵，或是畜牧，誰非表示追求物質，以滿足他們物質生活的需要。現在社會呢，個人與家庭的物質生活，一致提高，那對經濟方面，更發生較為密切的關係。近代國家呢，觀察其一切立法與行政，均不能離開經濟的背景。最近國際呢，談到關係與合作，又要不以經濟為前提。這樣看來，經濟學一門，不但是專門學者，須當特別研究，即是普　的社民衆，也應明瞭一個梗概，纔能適應現代會。</p>
<p>二·研究經濟的材料</p>
<p>經濟的材料，固然複雜，如果用科學方法，歸納起來，也不過左列各種。初學經濟者，應該分門別類，尋序鑽研，由淺入深，自易彈精。如果有了研究門徑，對經濟科學有了相當認識，那也可以就個性之所好，從左列各門中找出一個系統，作進一步的研究，亦未嘗不可</p>
<p>（三）從經濟政策方面去研究：經濟政策，是經濟思想家的表現，經濟學者研究結果的方法，現在各國政府，採取為互助或敵對的手段的。經濟政策，細分之，有貨幣政策，關稅政策，國際貿易政策種種。然其主要的原動力，不外下列三種：（一）自由貿易政策；（二）保護關稅政策；（三）新重商政策。</p>
<p>（四）從經濟問題方面去研究：經濟問題，有國際的，有國內的。研究到這地步，那末對於經濟原理，經濟思想，經濟政策，均有相當的了解了。譬如拿最近的白銀問題來說；這個問題，牽涉經濟原理中貨幣論一部份，交換和分配都要談到；又牽涉到國際貿易政策的一部份，各國經濟槪况亦要了然；欲明瞭一個究竟，或找着一個結果，當然不是初學經濟者所能辦到呢。除此而外，經濟專題甚多，如關稅問題，美國金條文案問題，歐州法比意等國維持金本位問題，中國通貨膨脹問題等等。視學者性之所好，均可從事研究，以解決國內外之經濟恐慌，而追求一有效的救濟對策。</p>
<p>四。研究經濟的方法：</p>
<p>（一）從經濟原理方而去研究：經濟原理重在解釋或爭辯原則之當否為問題；包括四大部份，就是生產論，交易論，分配論，消費論。近代社會中的任何經濟現象，皆在這四部份裏邊，不入於此，則人於彼。初學經濟者，當先明白這原理；研究經濟論者，尤須追求這個原則</p>
<p>（二）從經濟思想方面去研究：經濟思想，為整個經濟學的來源，有些是片段的經濟觀。但這種片段觀念往往是後來有系統，有組織，而發揚光大的經濟學說。有些則包括經濟整個剖份雖然經濟思想未盡是經濟學說，然而有了經濟思想，纔會發生現在經濟組織，非解釋以往經濟現象十六世紀以來歐州經濟思想，不外兩大潮流　　曰自由主義；曰國家主義。前者認為經濟係由個人主動，國家不應干涉其發展；所以有人稱為個人主義。後者認為社會財富，應由國家權力支配，無論生產，交換，分配，或消費，個人自由活動降到零度。所以有人稱為干涉主義。就是現在所謂的社會主義，也包在內。茲列表於后，以便博覽旁搜易於研究：</p>
<p>經濟的材料，旣然知到分別觀察。然而研究起來；也要有方法，纔能明白透澈，得着圓滿的結果。　　把古人研究的方法，介紹於後</p>
<p>（一）分析法或演繹法：古典派的經濟學者，研究經濟，　用這個方法。有從心理學方面入手，把個人的愆望與需要種種的經濟定律加以演釋，形成今日心理學派的經濟學者。有些用數學或代數的方式去演繹，所以又稱為數學派的經濟學者。</p>
<p>（二）事實觀察法：用這種方法的經濟學者，注重事實的演進，忽視抽象的分析，恰與古典派的經濟學者相反。這裏邊又為三組：</p>
<p>甲·直接觀察法—法國Leplay學派；</p>
<p>乙·　史考證法—德國Hiletant　Koscher　Sctomlier　；</p>
<p>丙·經濟觀察法—現代立法家多屬之</p>
<p>古人的研究方法如此，我們應該採取那種呢？前者注重分析，那末對人類實際生活的遷變，和人生需要物質的動機，未免略視。後者祗顧事實，那也未免過懷成見，而缺乏客觀的熊度。我們如果研究，要擇兩種之長，併用兩個方法；先觀察經濟的現象，繼考核歷史上的事實，然後用演繹的方法去分析；那末研究任何方面的經濟材料，不難迎刃而解呢</p>
<p>（五）研究經濟的對象興希望：</p>
<p>生產，交換，分配，和消費，的各種經濟對象，不外　個人，社會，國家，與國際。我們研究過後，至少應具若干希望，說到個人呢，應該節約，纔能將勞力所獲的儲蓄，增加生產：個個如此，社會富量，也可因之加增說到社會呢，勞資兩方、均應互助，社會生產力，纔不因衝突而减少，大家物質生活。當漸進步說到國家呢，政府應取干涉主義，實行統制經濟；然後一國的財富生產，財富分配，均有整個計劃，不致顧此失波，引起社會。的紛擾，或列强的侵略。說到國際呢，惟有實行經濟合作，與經濟提携，不但世界鬥爭纔可消滅，而人類幸福，方得眞正的提高。否則此國富，彼國貧，東鄰物質發達，西鄰物質缺乏，那種畸形的現象，只是人類的不幸。</p>
<h3 id="c180">怎樣研究歷史 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 何炳松</p>
<p>這個題目範圍狠大，斷算一言可了。現在只好把讀史的功用和態度提出幾點愚見，供讀者的參考。</p>
<p>歷史是人類往事的紀錄，有同我們個人經騐的回憶。個人的經驗靠了回憶，能够指示我們前進的途徑；人類的往事靠了紀錄，能够指示我們行路的方針。同時我們讀過歷史，不但可以明白中外文化各有不同的特點和動向；而且可以明白中外文化都在時時　化，足以增加我們向前奮嗣的勇氣。</p>
<p>還有一點，凡是現代式的學者，無論他是文學家或者化學家，必須抱一種「歷史的態度一。所謂歷史的態度就楚遇事必窮究」源委。源委弄明白了。才可見到那件事的本末令體。　如治河，我們一定要從上流調查測景做起。如只在下流方面用功，就要毫無結果。我們要明白社會上一切人事的內容和價值，亦是如此。單憑現狀而不溯源流，就要陷於知二五而不知一十的武斷，斷不够用。這一個態度是現代學術上最要的一個熊度，唯有讀中才可培賽起來</p>
<p>研究歷史，和研究其他科學一樣，一面要博，一面要精。以博來擴大我們對於人類往事的認識，以精來集中我們對於某一時代，某一地域，或某一部門史事的注意。博然後大，精然後深。就大體上說，我們讀史應以博為主，有餘力時再求其精。博是常識的培養，精是專門的研究。研究某一種學術，總宜先來豐富的常識，再去做精究的專家。</p>
<p>研究歷史還有一個附帶的功用，就是排除成廷。所以現代科學的史學家總能竭力排除自已的成見。因為作史而有成見，就容易顚倒是非，喧賓奪主。失去了現代科學家那種平心雙氣，公正不倚的態度。凡是先立定主張，再雜凑史事以證實這種主張的歷史著作，都亦能當做一種宣傳個人主張的作品。我們自己作史固然不宜有成見，就是讀他人著作時亦須先看看著作人有無成見。</p>
<p>我們都是中國人，都應認識一點中國史。。我們亦都是現代人，亦都應讀一點外國史。我們讀中國史，可以明白世界上的最古最大文明國所以保存的原因。我們讀外國史，可以明白我們自己這個古文明國何以到如今要受外國的壓迫。同時我們讀中國史，可以使我們明白我們的文化是什麼，和怎樣改造他，使他適合現代的需要。我們讀外國史，可以使我們明白西洋的文化是什麼，和怎樣介紹過來，使之中國化了，以適合中國的需要。</p>
<p>總之，凡是現代中國的靑年，都應讀一點中國史和外國史，來增加必要的常識，培養「歷史的熊度，深切了解中外文化的異同和復興民挨文化的途徑，决心做一個創造中國本位文化的健全分子。</p>

<p>經濟專刊英鎊前途之推測  冷波　　在過去半年中，英鎊呈鬆弱之勢，以美元而言，由五·一〇元跌至四·八五元，以法郎而言，由七六·二五法郎跌至七三法郎。惟其跌落的步調，並非一致，時而緊張，時而弛緩，此乃因其所遭受的各種影響有所不同故也。如去年秋季對於美元的收買，去年十一月間金集團之政治與金融的紊亂，以及最近美國金條欺案尚未宣判以前的凌亂等是，英鎊之價值在此半年中僅跌百分之四，故較稱穩定。然而尚引起不良的批評，而金鎊在歐陸各令融中心在不久以前，亦失其信仰。　　欲找出最近英鎊跌落的根本原因，實非易事。據英國貿易局（Board　of　Trade）最近的估計，英國國際收支的不利差額僅為一百萬鎊，此種估計固難精確，但是耶使在英國有利的方面再多估出一二千萬鎊，而常此資金大量移動中的今日，其所估計之不利差額之數目，亦不足為影響鎊價主要的原因。再據一月份之貿易報吿所示，英國之貿易地位並未退步，其貿易不利差額，亦較去年同期减少。至於英鎊之購買力，若與一年前或去年八月間之法郎及美元的購買力相較，則英鎊以美元而言。其價值尚為高估，但最後美國物價之高漲及鎊滙之縮短，則此項價值的為估，遂歸消滅；惟以法郎而言，英鎊之價值，仍為低估，其低估之程度雖較八月間者稍大，但僅抵去年二月間者三分之二。　　吾人甚易誤視美元價值的低估與法郎價值的高估，其中間之差別是使英鎊跌落的主因。實則些三種貨幣間之差異，自去年起已大為减少也。且此種差異，即使無英鎊的跌價，亦可有同樣之减少。蓋因美元與法郎間的平衡已日趨接近，而英鎊在此二幣間所處之地位，則須由其本身的特殊因素而决定耳。其决定之原因究竟如何？有如下文所述：　　首先吾人須知英鎊與各種金幣（美元亦包括在內）間的關係，不僅是受英國國內的貿易情形所決定，而亦受英鎊集團整個酌貿易情形所決定。倘英帝國（包含加拿大澳洲南非等在內）阿根庭及其他金幣國家間的貿易衰落，而英鎊集團內部的滙兌率仍無變更時，則此種壓迫，即不免於英鎊滙價上表現。在英國的各統治邦中其地位亦有不如一年前的强固者，例如澳洲羊毛出口價值之縮减，即其一端。其次吾人對於倫敦與其他各國金融的中心的利息水準，亦應加以注意。英國政府所採行的低利政策Cheap　Money　Rolicy　,使短期利率降至最抵之紀錄。長期者亦降至三厘以下，實較巴黎現行之利率為低，但其低於紐約者之程度不若低於巴黎者之甚，按正統經濟學派的理論，倫敦資金將自然流入巴黎，吾人對於此種解釋，須　　第一為存於倫敦之外幣的數量問題，其準確數目，吾人不得而知，但可得而言者，為較一九三一年恐慌發生以前為少。倫敦之情况，固較四年前為鞏固。但倘政府不加干涉，即不甚激烈之提欵，亦可使其滙價跌落。吾人更應加以注意者，為倫敦與巴黎間短期利率之差額，久與遠期法郎的貼現相抵，蓋該貼現即至今日，仍等於年利一厘半也。是以法國銀行現在收買英國庫券（Treasury　Bill）可賺利二厘，興能，則英國之投資家對於在歐陸的長期投資，常取審愼之態度，固不僅視利息之厚薄而已也　　此外吾人對於心理上的形態，亦應加以注意。蓋當此他國資金大量兼容避之際，心理作用甚關重要。約於三星期前，外人對於英鎊之信心，因種種原因，突受搖撼。其原恩呢如樹脂與胡椒投機之失敗，而使國外金融受極大之影響。更甚者如因Wavertree地方的選舉與失業協助的計劃而造成政府行將改組及普選先期舉行之種利謠言；而其發生適當關於金集國各國幣制穩定與否的謠言叢生之時，故產生一種疑慮之觀念。念其觀為：凡一種不穩定之貨幣有時必將跌落，英國，欲一方採行無限制的低利政策，而同時又希望維持其鎊的穩定，實不可能　　此種心理上的原因，或為暫時的現象，但實予吾人一種警吿。是時英國政府證券適大漲價，而外國投資者，對英國在議會的生命能否持久，方有疑問。是以許多外國投資家，以為現在為拋資英國證券最宜之時，以便獲利，而將其資金再運還本國。對於工黨將來得權之推測，無論其為正確，或為錯誤，皆足減少英鎊之信用。該黨對於凡已經林用過的各種金本位皆拒絕復用，並希望用國際的動作以穩定滙兌，簡言之，該黨之方策尚未確定，然而其引起外人對於英鎊不信任之處，由於其貨幣政策者少，而由於其增加歲出所生之恐慌則更多也，故此種疑慮。只有該黨領袖始能使其消散。　　同時吾人所欲問者，為英鎊跌價是否易生有害之影響？英鎊每跌落一次，即增加金集團之困難一次，而上漲則為該團所歡迎，然英鎊的價值縱有最近之跌落，但若與一般貨幣比較。尚無十分低估之象。　　英鎊現狀雖不是發生恐慌，然亦不應聽其自然，凡由於投機及心理的關係而發生倫敦資金的外流，應自行抵消，蓋此種原因不合於眞正之經濟事實的情况，而不久即可自然矯正也。惟以往資金外流之所以不能抵消者，或因其當局者認為此乃資金之正當的减少，或因平準基金之來源，不足以維持此項困難工作。在第一種情形下，則不當用任何方法以停止其外流。在第二種情形下，則無方法能使其停止也。如提高銀行利率，則其擾亂國內外信用之影響，將較吸收外資流入倫敦者為甚。一九三二年至一九三三年聞所積累之現金，此時若有一部份輸出國外，尤其在此項輸出外復有外人提取倫敦之存欵時，則其為衰弱現象的表示，自較英鎊逐漸跌落者為尤顯著。　　但以上各種可能情勢，距今尚屬遼遠。現在英鎊之跌落，僅在與以前數月之穩定狀態比較而顯著。在英鎊仍未穩定，尤其是市塲仍為心理作用所波動之時，則最近數週所發生之各種現象，殆屬無可避免也。　汕頭通貨制度崩潰之研討  鄧邦傑　　汕頭銀業，自前年四月廿六日迄今，遭遇絕大之風險，覆亡者幾度其半，　時之士，　言救濟，因其觀察之不同，而其主張遂亦形成兩大派：其一，以為現象所以惡劣，在乎通貨運用之不足，故主張膨脹通貨，以救目前，此之謂通貨膨脹派。一則以為市塲之騷動，在乎產業保證紙幣信用之失　，其始則主張互助聯保以維信用，故有總兌換之主張，繼則主張通貨收縮，以安人心，是謂通貨收縮派。茲先主張及其實施而評議其得失。　　（一）通貨膨脹時期　　（一）意義　汕頭原為銀碼頭，民元之十年間，通用紋銀；民元十年前後，則用銀元折合紋銀。其間私家莊頗有發行紙幣，然未能推翻紋銀本位。民國十四年四月一日起改行大洋制，紙幣計算單位亦改從大洋，發行漸多，流通甚廣。因無現金準備之限制，且以其時銀元跌價，多被轉運他埠，遂致現洋缺乏，發行銀莊未能履行其兌現義務，以紙換紙，寖假而成紙碼頭。此處所言通貨膨脹者實即指軟幣（Paper　　（二）由來　查汕頭商塲，初亦頗重信用，操業之人不必擁有鉅資，而有無來往，俱重互信。其時市狹小，通貨尙敷週轉。及後市面日即繁榮，壽碼似感不足，故至民元之十年間，因有私家紙幣之發行。其始以無須產業或現金作準備，僅憑發行者之信用，大利所在，羣起濫發，最多時嘗達一千餘萬元。後經民十八政府之限制，發行紙幣，須提供產業作保證；其無保證者陸續收回，及因銀莊倒閉而自然消滅者，市面紙額乃减至五百餘萬元，年來發行銀莊倒閉屢見，乃復减至三百餘萬元。金融運轉，未免漸失圓滑；幸賴金價上漲，僑胞滙欵返汕者日多，民廿一閒，曾達五千餘萬元，造成最高紀錄。常年亦達四千萬元左右，得以補充其缺。近以南洋商業，亦受不景氣打擊，僑胞匯欵返汕者驛減四分之三，年不過千餘萬而已。通貨之補充旣失其泉源，而國際埠際之貿易，常居於逆勢，國外銀價又日見高漲，現洋遠引而去，存底日兔崽子柘竭，非亟謀通貨擴張，將不足以資週轉，此即通貨膨脹派所以抬頭也。　　（三）實施經過　前年四月廿六日，和慶銀莊因週轉不靈而倒閉，影響所及，殷實商號覆亡者甚衆，金融頓現捉襟見肘之狀。匯兌業同業公會乃議决發行聯保白票，每家一萬五千元，全市合共百有餘萬元，以產業作保證，不兌現，不貼息，行使期間為一月，以救當前之急，是為第一次通貨膨脹。及五月七日，信用素孚之寶盛·阜安兩莊，亦因週轉不靈而倒閉。滙兌業同業公會乃復於是日開會議决，再發行聯保白票百餘萬元，辦法同前，是為第二次膨脹，後經輿論反對，未實現。厥後因週轉不靈而續行倒閉者報不絕載，亦皆發行紙幣之銀莊，一倒之後，街前紙幣即不能流通，通貨愈感缺乏。市商會乃於五月廿六日開會議决白票之行使期間延長一月。七月廿六日屆滿，需要尚殷，未便收回，即八月一日匯兌業同業公會議决自動收回之議决案，亦迄無力照行。而永大成記莊又於二日因週轉不靈而宣吿淸理。核其賬面純值（Net　Worth），以之淸償債務，綽有餘裕，其非因營業失敗而為流動資金（Working　Capital）缺乏之所致，甚為明顯。九月三十日，湖陽幫最穩固銀莊源大·成茂·兩號復告爾閉，其發行之保證紙幣四十餘萬元驛成廢紙，市面籌碼益感不足，幸由馬合豐莊仗義代兌，金融市塲始免整個毀滅。十二月七日，澄帮最殷實銀號光發·智發·鴻發盛·三莊相率倒閉；八日乾興昌亦繼其後，籌碼復减數十萬元。經市商會議决之發保證紙廿五萬餘元，准加蓋「市商會流通券」戳記，照常流通，名曰流通券。並議决全市保證紙不論已倒未倒，四個月內一律不兌現，以救通貨之不足。是時核計市面保證紙約三百二十餘萬餘元，白票約一百二十餘萬元，現洋約一百餘萬元。舊歷年關迫近，區區六百萬餘元之通貨，不足以資運轉，匯兌業同業公會乃發行保證單，銀業公會亦發行輔助券，各一百餘萬元，是為第三次膨脹，銀業中人不無誤信通貨膨脹為萬應靈藥矣。先是在前年十一月廿七日，省財廳召開全省經濟會議，議决，准各縣市發行地名流通券，以資調劑金融，挽救危局。廣州方面首先獲准發行商庫證三百萬元。汕頭通貨膨脹派亦躍躍欲試，援例呈請准予發行商庫證一千萬元，函電交馳，往返籲請，直至去年七月廿三日始奉准發行八百萬元，是為第四次通貨膨脹。乃商庫證發行不久，九月十九日有全市拒收流通券，鬧兌保證紙之事件發生，十月十七日，復有全市保設紙三百餘萬元突吿停止流通之曠古未有之大恐慌。從事實上觀之，通貨膨脹政策只能圖苟安於一時，未能策治安於永久，其理明甚。　　（二）總兌換時期　　（一）意義　汕頭自有私家紙幣以來，因無現金準務之限制，紙幣未能兌換現洋，以紙換紙，旣成牢不可破之習慣。發行銀莊視為固然，持票之人亦安之不疑，故能保持此種惡劣風氣於數十年之久。年來整個銀業信用失墮，不論何家所發紙幣，市面一律拒收，以紙換紙之習慣乃為打破。銀業為謀紙幣流通起見，不能不籌集現金以備兌換，又恐陳容渙散，易為市民各個擊破，率一　而動全身，乃集中現金準備，聯合兌換各莊保證紙幣，以保信用，而維流通，此即總兌換政策之意義也。　　（二）由來　考保證紙幣之制度，原有各家聯保之規定，一家受擠，全體出救濟法本甚善。惟事實上，一家受擠之時，亦卽全體危險之時，自顧不暇，安能濟人，聯保制度所以空碍難行者在此。前年九月三十日，源大·成茂·兩號倒閉時，各號袖手旁觀，無敢加以援手，其中固有黨派感情之作用（汕銀業分捐·普揚：澄·潮饒兩派：源大等屬前派。）然而四十萬元之代兌，實亦能力上有所不及。惟是，年來倒閉相接，風浪險惡，自保亦亡，聯保亦亡，與其自保而亡，不如聯保以求不亡，乃憬然覺悟，重提聯保互助之　。　　（三）實施經過　自經九月十九日及十月十七日兩次之風潮後，銀業中人深知通貨膨脹政策之不足信賴，乃努力於保證紙幣信用之維持。九月十九日，銀業公會集議救濟辦法，議决發行保證紙各荘號應全體聯保。十月十七日復議决，先行互助以實現聯保，無淪何家發生擠兌，報吿公會後，卽轉知各發行莊號備欵互助兌換，十九日復議决改善互助辦法如下：　　一、將前互助辦法撤銷，改由依照紙額派現欵三成，彙集本公會，代兌臨時互助各莊紙幣，以昭信用，而安市面。　　一、該現欵三成，每日上午九時以前帶會齊集，以應兌換，至下午五時，各自照額領回。倘是日兌換紙幣有超過該莊紙幣六成以上時如該莊有欵換回該莊本幣，應將該紙封按，再將封按之現欵照額乎均分交全體各莊保留，又將該溢額紙幣由會封交各莊保管，至次日仍各帶會備用。　　一、自十月廿二日起，臨時互助各莊號保證紙幣一律在本公會兌換。　　一、試辦兩月，期滿，另行開會。　　一、臨時經費，按照紙額平均負擔。　　一、會中工作，由全體莊號分為六組輪流擔任，惟工作人員，須由該莊負資。　　是為總兌換政策之眞面目。市商會銀業聯席會議議决實行通貨收縮政策後，銀業亦於十一月一日開會，議决各發行莊除依照市商會銀業聯席會議議决案按發行額提供

<p>春秋點滴  肖白　　孩子生來本就是詩人，因為他最眞擎，沒為虛偽，在勢利塲中的人們，我是壓根兒也不會承認有偉大的詩人，因為他們的所謂熱情，奔放，大都是仍建築在金錢上的。　　現代那些藝術家的心靈，大都是脆弱的，因為他們不把人生看得太嚴肅，就是看得太隋從裡到外，自殺是成了他們「怯弱」和「無能」和最後　　，我們又有何值得大驚小怪呢！　　「一切都無希望，祗有等候一個奇蹟來更新一切」，這據說是世界某大文學家的話，可是。我對它就覺得有些懷疑，難道「奇蹟」是可等候的嗎？我們不努力，不前進，永遠停留在醜惡的現實中，「奇蹟」就會自己跑來嗎？花名五十客  拾玖　　花是人人所愛好的。以花喻人，見於古人文字者不勝述，而以宋程棨三柳軒雜識所喻為最完備。茲引其說如下，以告世之愛花者：　　花名十客，世以為雅戲，姚氏殘語演為三十客。其中有未當者，暇日因易其一二；且復得二十客幷著之：　　牡丹為佳客梅為淸客蘭為幽客桃為天客杏為艷客蓮為凈客桂為巖客海棠蜀客　躑躅山客　梨為淡客　　瑞香閩客木芙蓉醉客菊為壽客酴醿才客蠟梅寒客（改久）素香韻客　　瓊花仙客（改尊）丁香情客葵為忠客木槿時客（改莊）玫瑰刺客月桂痴客含笑佞客石榴村客（改霞天）鼓子田客曼陀羅惡客孤燈窮客棠梨鬼客棣棠俗客（改和）木筆書客　　以上皆姚氏所定，此下新添二十客：　　芍藥嬌客　鳳仙淚客紫微高調客冰仙雅客杜鵑仙客萱花歡客橘花雋客杷子禪客　來禽靚客山礬幽客　　楝花晚客菖蒲隱客枇梔粗客玉繡毯巾客茉莉神客凌霄勢客李花俗客（改潔）迎春僭客月丹豪客菱花水客　　按觀上所列，除「幽客，」「俗客」重複外，其餘花品，或褒或貶，均以一字槪之，頗見匠心。至改某云云，係從淸伍芝軒「讀書樂趣」本。石榴稱「霞天客，」固勝於「村客」，但石榴是張騫使西域所得故似亦可稱為「番客。」媽姐  闌刪　　那些媽姐們（就是廣東順德一帶的女子，聯絡每十人為一羣號為十姊妹，立志守貞，嫁後不與丈夫共雲雨，出外自行謀生的人。）你可不要輕看了；伊們纔是世界上最了解而又能實行「合作」的人。在上海，也有伊們最優越的出路，便是在旅滬粵僑中的富戶帮傭伊們精於烹飪，工價頗高，月薪在二十元以上。（蘇浙兩省女傭。有許多還不及伊們工價之半）　　伊們每十人共賃屋而居，費用由各人平均担負，有事做時便在東家處歇宿，解僱時便回到「公會」裏過日，伊也無容付費，有其他九人代為維持。　　伊們氣性最硬，東家有一句不順耳的話得罪了，伊便馬上辭職，不比他處女傭肯逆來順受。　　伊們的裝束是一致的，梳一個大大的髻，黑色衣服，其年靑而美麗者，別有一種丰韻。　　到菜市買小菜，並不提籃，帶一隻大蒲包，小菜買妥時，放在肩頭揹着，人人如是。　　有些媽姐是始終不曾嫁過的，有些雖然嫁了，伊們的丈夫仍然嘗不到禁臠。伊們的規矩是，寗願將自己帮傭所得，以一筆的欵，給伊們的丈夫娶妾，而本人却於摒棄了閨房之樂。　　伊們從年靑時帮傭直至年老，每人手頭都有二三千元的積蓄，有許多自購地產而生利的，亦有合股營業的，比我們這一羣沒出息的男子好得多了。　　伊們多數皈依觀世音菩薩，畢生食素，（帮傭時自己另治蔬食，）到中年時，都向各處有名的尼菴中拜有德行的尼姑為師，另以一千或數百元存在菴裏，等到倦勤時便入菴長住，終其殘生。　　有一位六十多歲的媽姐，精神極佳，仍在工作，擁有六千餘元，甚為儉樸，每年到普陀山進香一次。　　虹口武昌路一帶，多有伊們的寓處。小西天  張恨水著　　第十一回　夜話凄凉生涯原是夢履痕零亂風雨太欺人　　可是這西安城裏的地質，全是極細的黃土，在下過雨之後，不但是街上，就是人家院子裏，也沒有不是化爛得像漿糊一樣。小西天前面、屋子外都有走廊，向後面走出後院去，那就要經過個大空闊的院子。在院子中間，雖也舖了一路磚塊，無如這雨落得久而且大，將高處的浮土，冲刷着向低處流，把這行磚塊，都也掩蓋了，任憑放開脚步在石頭上跳着走，可是脚落下去，還是留下很深很深的雨行鞋印子。浣花手上，又不曾撑着傘，雨正下得牽絲一般，當他跳過這個院子，由頭上到脚底，已經沒有一寸乾的。這個院子裏面，還套着一個小院子，便是程志前住的所在。他也是感到十分無聊，站在廊檐下，由小門裏向外看着雨勢，也見一固時裝女子，這樣的在雨地裏跳着，很可詫異，就不由得注意起來。只見他跳到後面屋檐下，並不停住，只頓頓脚，又把透濕的衣襟，牽了兩下，繼續的走了。恰好有個茶房穿了套鞋，撐着雨傘，也向後面走去。志前便道：前面有個女客，在泥漿的地下走出去了，你何不將傘和他共撑了出去。茶房微笑道：也願意這樣，由也去罷。志前道：他為什麼願意這樣？茶房道：也搶着要去作媒呢。其實也和我借傘借鞋，也並不是借不到的，他要這樣忙着去搶功，我們只好由他去了。程志前道：作媒？替誰作媒呢？茶房笑道：就是胡小脚家裏去的那個小姑娘。（一七七）小學敎員和賣草紙的  不聊生　　昨日從弄堂小學拿了本月份薪金回來，一隻手在袋裏緊緊的握這十六大元，一面腦子計劃這個月的家用預算。左想也不够，右想也不够，心裏有點發燥起來。後來一想到我的朋友兼同行何先生，他在×立××小學當三年級敎師，薪水雖然比較我好點，可是去年十二月份的到現在還未發，家裏差不多連老婆的短褲也當了，不禁爽然自失。這樣一面行一面想的行到崑山花園附近，忽然天上下起雨來，而且越下越密。為着想保護那件唯一的門面長衫起見，我不得已避入崑山花園旁面的公厕裏。在那裏我聽到一段『勝讀十年書』的話。　　一個也是避雨躲在這裏工人模樣的男子，大約閒着無聊的原故，和公厕裏賣草紙的攀談起來。工人問；『賣草紙一日可賣得三吊錢麼？『賣草紙的哼了一聲說：『你不要看不起賣草紙，一日好賣二十多吊啦。就是給工部局每月也要九十元，遠要送一二十元禮給辦事先生。如果一日賣三吊錢，老婆也要蝕掉啦。像八仙橋等處，每日好賣一百五十吊，出三百元一月也承辦不到哩。』　　我在旁邊暗中替他算一算，每月竟最少有一百元進賬，比我們敎員好五倍多。我馬上向天立了一個誓，祇要我有機會，我改行賣草紙了。御香縹緲錄  淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯　　單是從事在這製造鳳鞋一項工作上的時間；至少也有二十多年了，所以太后對於伊們，比較上也是很優待的。在伊們手下工作的還有八個年輕的姑娘，伊們都曾經過一番嚴格的訓練：第一件伊們必須學習打樣，所謂打樣，就是在白紙上預先畫出各式各樣的鞋子來，以為着手製造的依據。這打樣的一部份工程，如其只需畫出一個約略的輪廓，自然是不很費事的；但伊們所打的樣，却必須非常的精細，而且在畫好之後，還得用極細極細的絲線，就在紙上粗具規模的界將起來。因此，每打一份樣兒，總得費許多的心力。再加從前時候的人，在工作的時候，對於光綫往往是絕不注意的；宮內旣沒有適當的燈光，特地為伊們配置，伊們自己也不甚介意，於是伊們的目力，便不免大受傷書，做不到二三年工夫，就得在鼻子上架起一副光度很深的老式眼鏡來了。　　太后對於製鞋這一部份工藝的興趣，雖沒有欣賞育蠶那樣的高，但也决非絕不注意，平均在一個月內，總得有一兩次親自走到伊們工作的所在去察看察看。可是當伊老人家才打御座上站起身來，打算開步走的當兒，早有一個太監忽忽的先自趕將出去，知照了那些製鞋的藝工們，好讓伊們凑早收拾好一切，並用心工作起來，靜待太后駕臨。（二八八）（晒絲）拉雜話鐘話  淸癯　　鐘考諸釋名云，「鐘空也。內空，受氣多，故聲大」是以聲名，而不以質取義。按周禮，又皆作鍾，與酒器相溷，斯亦異也。或以鐘名蒲牢，則更非是。東都賦：發鯨魚，鏗華鐘」。注　島有大獸，名蒲牢。蒲牢畏鯨魚，鯨魚一擊，蒲牢輒大吼。凡鐘欲令聲大，故作蒲牢於上，所擊者為鯨魚之狀」。然則蒲牢固非鐘也明甚。」　　昔嘉定城之東南隅，有鐘樓一所，相傳明萬歷十八年知縣熊密所建。以地城無谿山，而一望平衍，治之西偏，北有虞山馬鞍山泖上諾峯，遙峙三面，而東南接大海，萬里空闊，渺無屏障，人事相應，不可以為邑。乃建樓於城之卯位，駕巨鐘於其上，雉堞蜿蜓，有若龍蟠，危樓矗起，頭角崢嶸，欲上雲霄，噌硡鞺鞳，宣洩聲光，蕩滌陰滯。此雖不免涉於神話，而據故里父老云：當時　高數仭，上作丹樓，中施梯級，傍布欄楯登樓遙睇，汪洋萬頃，隱隱可睹，而晨夕鐘聲響起，尤令人若朱子宿金山寺，夜半聞鐘聲，心中把捉不住。鐘之為力亦偉矣！後此鐘於同治元年，為西人攫去，蓋在長髪軍佔領邑城，而洋兵自滬與官軍進剿之時，而鐘去樓空。或謂曩日三馬路之火鐘，即為此物，顧二十年前，愚與吾邑黃君銘之，及太倉朱君凱壽，會至最上層，欲一觀其所鑄之年月，而惜為鐘口所罩，不能昂視其旁，卒末由證其究竟是否為憾。今鐘已他徙，而吾邑之樓，亦無人發起興修，古跋云亡，為之一慨！　　寶山縣東南隅，奎星閣內，亦有一鐘，名「氽來鐘」。據云：「明時巡江御史朱吾弼建閣而土人在海岸撈獲一鉅鐘，遂懸於其中，以杵叩之，其饗可聞數里，歷良久始已。而其回音則特異，若非金類然，諦聽之，有如人言，如曰「懊惱來。」相傳中具精金喉舌，故聲淸越，不同凡響。嗣為遠道之骨董客所悉，被暗中翦去，音自是不及曩時之繚繞可聽矣。癸丑之役，游兵競以槍擬鐘，一彈飛射，適洞其緣，再擊之，竟無異啞鐘，至此始悟「懊惱來」云者，即為其讖語也。</p>

<p>申報醫藥周刊南京市立八卦洲農民敎育館衛生實施三年計劃  花新人　　八卦洲轄南京市，為長江中之一小島，南對燕子磯，北對六合縣，東毘巴斗山，西鄰下關，交通頗便利，由下關之老江口碼頭乘小火輪約四十五分鐘可直達，全境面積週圍約四十五方哩，計田八萬餘畝，地勢平坦無出，中有小河，而少森林，全洲輪廓頗為整齊，呈八卦形，因以之為名，戶口約七千，本洲昔為茅柴荒島，民十九年開始墾殖，居民均由安徽無為縣移居而來，民情古樸，風氣閉塞，但尚安居樂業，多為自耕田，物產以小麥，棉花，玉蜀黍，黃荳等為大宗。　　京市社會局以八卦洲為一新市區，乃於民二十三年二月成立一農民敎育館，綜攬全洲一切社會敎育事宜，後又成立一衛生組，設衛生室於總館及分館內，本衛生組之組織系統如下：　　敎育館因創辦不久，房屋又不敷分配，故衛生室設於餐室及閱覽室內，每日來室門診者甚夥，本館有民校二所，實為實施鄉村敎育之良好實騐區，社會局有鑒及此，因責成健康敎育委員會與本館合作訂定三年衛生敎育計劃，作實騐期中之實施。　　三年計劃　　（一）目標：以學校為中心，用以推行整個之公共衛生，由實施結果之經騐，考定一般鄉村衛生方案。　　（二）原則：鄉村衛生車業應以簡單而易於普及實施為原則，在實騐期中應尋求研究問題，以便由研究實騐中尋求實施方法，若果能使研究與實騐合一方能收事半功倍之效，而事業之進步必更速，成效亦必更多也，三年計劃應以衛生敎育作中心，其進步之步驟另表列之。　　（三）總述：三年衛生敎育計劃，可分三年完成之：　　第一年為「嘗試工作」，以實施治療為主，聯絡民衆感情，並作社會衛生之調查，以明瞭農民整個生活，注重衛生敎育，以學校為實施之中心，——作衛生與敎育之連鎖之研究與實施，——此期為完成治療與敎育之工作。　　第二年為「實騐工作」，注重環境衛生之改進，作預防疾病之實施，進一步訓練衛生隊，培養自動自主的單位衛生工作人員，此期為完成預防與保健制度之工作。　　第三年為「研究工作」，充分與各機關合作，以地方自治為基本研究實騐成績，推行全洲公共衛生並考察實施鄉村衛生之基本原則，此期為完成實施時期　　（五）實施計劃大綱　　A實施原則　　（一）宣傳科學化之新醫藥衛生常識。　　（二）使各個人之體格獲適宜之發育，並保持其天然健康。　　（三）消除及防止疾病之來源傳染，改良易於致病之環境。　　（四）减少全洲死亡率，延長平均壽命。　　B實施範圍　　第一項：學校範圍。　　查衛生敎育為吾人實施衛生第一步當注意者，其目的在使農民明瞭衛生常識，以促進國民之健康，吾國對於鄉村衛生事業最當注意者有二一。師大多數民衆缺乏衛生知褒與習慣之訓練，因此身體日漸衰弱，在農村中一般所發見者吉A清潔習慣之欠缺·B環境衛生之不良，C醫藥事業之幼身份證，D婦嬰衛生之缺如，E傳染病處置之欠妥，二卽無確定的適合農村生活，農民經濟之醫藥制度，有病無從就醫，遑論預防，因此宜充公注意於農民及農村實際生活的衛生敎育與確定適合於科學的醫藥制度。—卽社會的本位保健制—鄉村小學校為推廣衛生敎育之良好實騐處，欲普及鄉村衛生工作，當先由學校入手。各國學校口腔衛生過去史略（一）  司徒學　　司徒學君，為司徒博先生長公子，現留學日本齒科專校，刻在四年級，平日刻苦勤學，頗為師長所器重，課餘復從事著述，造詣正未可限量，他日學成歸國，於我國齒醫學界必有一番貢獻也。編者識　　學校口腔衛生應當設施之理由　　近時世界各國，對於學童之口腔衛生，英不深切注意。因欲普及口腔衛生，故於小學校設施口腔衛生敎育及齒科診療，一則敎授關於齒牙之衛生常識，一則預防學童齒牙之疾病，乃普及口腔衛生之最為重要者也。　　齲齒一症，患者最為普遍。現時文明各國，　蝕之羅患率，與文明之進化齊驅。兒童之罹患齲蝕者，約佔九十％以上，對於兒童身體之發育，影響殊深。故現時各國莫不盡力施行預防運動。所謂學校齒科診療所者，School　DentalClinic卽係欲達此目的而設，對於兒童之齒牙，不時加以澈底之保護，並實施口腔衛生之敎育，使兒童對於口腔衛生上有所涵養，得以養成健康之國民者也。　　預防齒牙　蝕，以兒童時期最為重要。故學校口腔衛生應當設施之理由，大約可分述如下。　　（一）自兒童時期養成正當口腔衛生之習慣，使可終生保守。　　（二）發育旺盛之兒童，若能嚴守養生法，及注重口腔衛生，則身體發育更為強壯。　　（三）注重口腔衛生，直接固可預防齒牙疾病，而間接亦可預防其他疾病。　　（四）於齒牙交換期，若能深加注意，則可防止將來齒列不正，或頸骨畸形。　　自學校設施齒科以來，雖僅三十餘年之歷史，但至今已日趨發達。所關學校齒科學School　Dentistry成兒童齒科學Pedodontia　W.等，新產生之學問，幾成一獨立分科矣。　　所謂學校齒科治療所者，乃學校口腔衛生實施之唯一重要機關，專為學童診療者也。茲將英美法德日，各國之學校口腔衛生過去廢達史略，略為分別述之。　　英國之學校口腔衛生　　世界之學校診辦所，創立最早者，本推比利士。（一八七七年三月）當時比利士對於學校衛生，較歐洲任何國家為注意，故對於齒牙衛生，亦較為進步，但至今日，比利士之齒科醫學甚為不振，殆因其齒科制度不良，故致衰落者也。　　彼時歐洲之口腔衛生，尚極幼稚，口腔衛生運動，寂寂無聞。其後約經七八年至一八八五年，英國齒科醫學會開會於劍橋，由MaCpherson　Fisher氏提議，「小學兒童之齒牙，須加以強制的保護，一由此動機，乃選出關於兒童齒牙之調查委員，而英國之口腔衛生運動，亦遂日見發展。及至一八九八年，乃組織學校齒科醫學會，School　DentistsSociety專門研究關於學校齒科事業，至今尚甚活動。在此過去二十年間，英國學校齒科衛生之發展，該會所言獻之功績，甚為偉大。而個人致力於此者，則有Cunningham氏及Pedley氏等，此實為英國口腔衛生運動史上不可　忘之人物也。　　現時英國之學校齒科設施，據一力二四年所調查，祇就倫敦一隅，已有五十四所，由五十四人之時間執務齒科醫，（有終日執務之區別），辦理約受二十五萬人以上之齒牙檢查，學童中約有十七萬人，須加治療者云。　　專任學校齒科者甚少，據一九二一年所調查，四百二十人之學校齒科醫中，專任者（卽終日執務者）僅百五十九人，而兼任者（時間執務者）有一百六十一人。故欲得充分之學校齒科醫，甚感困難，於是不得不由學校齒科助手之問題上着想，以謀補救。　　英國之學校齒科助手，於許可採用之一定條件下，由地方長官委任。自一九一八年Fisher氏提案以來，力謀學校齒科之發展，故學校齒科治療所增設日多，而學校齒科醫之需要亦日急，但英國之齒科醫數，終屬求過於供，故不得不養成齒科助手之人材，以供應社會之所處，至今學校齒科助手尚甚活動，蓋以此耳。　　美國之學校口腔衛生　　美國之學校口腔衛生運動，自一八九二年五月，由紐約州之Rochester市之齒科醫師團，先開端緒，於該市之市立病院，創設免費診療所，但惜經濟不充，未滿二年，卽吿停頓。其後經過十有餘年，該市之齒科醫有復興之計劃，得實業家Henry　Lomb氏之援助，得以再行實現，於一九零五年二月二十日，卽華盛頓誕生日，開始公診。此齒科治療所，乃專為一般貧困之民衆及學童檢查及治療之用。（美國此種免費齒科治療所，稱為The　free　Dental　Dispensary）及至一九一零年，該市之齒科醫師團，乘免費齒科治療所復興五週紀念之機會，更於該市之第十四公立小學校內，創設學校齒科治療所，此為美國學校齒科設立之嚆矢。Rochester市為美國口</p>

<p>腔衛生運動之發祥地。及至一九一七年，世界最理想的Rochester齒科病院成立，該院與波斯頓之Forsyih兒童診療院，（創於一九一四年）可稱為世界以兒童中心之最大齒科病院也。　　其次為Ohio州Cleveland市口腔衛生運動之發端，大約與Rochester市之運動不相前後，（一八九七年）係由該市之齒科醫師會，與市當局協商，製就關於口腔衛生敎育之宣傳品，分配各校學童，以喚起其對於口腔衛生之注意。及至一九零六年，乃創辦貧民免費齒科治療所。其後經過三年，卽一九零九年春，該市之齒科醫師會，口腔衛生委員長，W．G．Ebensol氏提倡，須實行檢查該市之學童口腔狀態，其計劃雖得市當局之認可，但當時民衆對於口腔衛生之常識，尚未普及，故單欲檢查兒童，已威相當困難。其後發展其檢查所得之成績，以促進市民之反省，高唱學校齒科治療所應有設立之必要，並竭力主張口腔衛生敎育之普及，於學童之敎育能率增進上，有重大之關係，得馬利安小學校校長Miss　Cordelin　Lo＇Neil之贊同於是編成口腔衛生史上最有價值之實騐學級。ExperimentaClass後將經過一年間實騐之成績發表，甚為可觀。疾病常識問答  程瀚章　　（五十五）壞血病（Scorbut）　　（問）壤血病是一種什麼疾病？　　（答）這是一種因為營養上缺乏丙種生活素而起的身體出血素因的疾病。　　（問）壞血病的原因是怎樣的？　　（答）壤血病從來早已知道他是一種營養障礙。當時把他的原因，歸之於航海時常吃鹹肉或缺乏新鮮的蔬菜。在今日知道他的原因就在食物中缺乏丙種生活素（Vitamin　C所以這種病，可以稱做丙種生活素缺損病。　　（問）患壞血病的人，那幾種人最多？　　（答）本病以少吃新鮮的植物性食品的人居多。所以多發生於船員，燈塔職工，或牢獄中的犯人。　　（問）發生壞血病的初始，現什麼病狀？　　（答）發病時，大都先現前驅病狀，就是全身倦怠，衰弱感，胸部壓迫苦悶感，心悸亢進，腰和上肢起風濕樣的疼痛，脛骨部有牽引性疼痛：這樣持續數天。這稱為前驅期。　　（問）到了病勢已進的時候，現出什麼病狀？　　（答）有出血及口腔黏膜的變化。　　（問）出血的情形怎樣？　　（答）身體的皮膚和軟部，都起自發的出血。皮膚的出血，槪現大小不同而稍隆起的暗赤色的斑點。其他，在軟部組織，皮下結締織，肌組織中或骨膜下起出血。又有作疼痛性的硬腫塊，也有一部分在皮下溢出血色素，現靑，綠，黃等着色。若肌肉內出血時過多時，小腿的腓髂肌，腫而硬，運動時發痛，於是步行的時候，一定要膝部屈曲。也有在各部黏膜面出血的。　　（問）口腔黏膜的變化怎樣？　　（答）口腔內黏膜的變化，最著明的是齒齦的變化。這時候齒齦現灰白色，腫脹，弛緩，有疼痛。容易出血。但沒有牙齒的齒齦，却不起出血。重的侵入深部，起壤死或形成潰瘍。　　（問）壞血病的病人，體溫和脈搏，有無變化？　　（答）體溫大都沒有變動；脈搏很緩慢，一分鈸約六十至四十次。　　（問）經過情形和預斷吉凶如何？　　（答）如果治療合宜，經過約數星期，可以全愈；但不免容易再發。預後佳良；可是重症的時候，往往合併腦出血，心包出血，敗血症和肺炎而致命。　　（問）怎樣療治壞血病？　　（答）第一，宜注意食品。多吃含有丙種生活素的鮮蔬菜，馬鈴薯，柑橋等。第二，對症療法，用氯化氫水（俗稱雙養水）漱口，齒齦面塗以收歛性藥液。對於皮膚出血，行濕布，溫罨法，塗以氤仿油。如有肌肉硬直疼痛等時，可行按摩法，水治法，或行運動的練習。（完）耳鼻喉眼衛生常識  唐仁縉　　（四十二）耳痛　　凡是有知覺的動物。自從脫離胎生以後。無論在什麼時候。都可以感覺到痛的。祇要有一個局部得着引起痛覺的機會。卽能隨時發生。我們人類旣是萬物之靈。所以無論那一種感覺。都比一切動物的感覺。來得靈巧。各種戚覺當中。尤以痛覺為最靈敏。而且非常複雜。痛的原因和部位。旣各不同。而痛的性狀。亦各有異。我們由痛的原因和部位。可以分為頭痛，眼痛，耳痛，鼻痛，喉痛，胃痛，腸痛，膽石痛，腎石痛，膀胱石痛，子宮痛，卵巢痛，尿道痛，荐骨痛，痔痛，四肢痛，及各種神經痛等等。至於痛的性狀。大略可以別為刺痛，絞痛，鈍痛，壓迫痛，痙孿痛，牽引痛，及持續痛，發作痛，間歇痛等等。關於這兩層的詳細情形。因為不是屬於本題。所以未便一一叙述。現在單就耳痛來討論一下。　　我們從耳痛的發生原因。可將耳痛別為（一）耳性耳痛，（二）放放散性耳痛，及（三）神經性耳痛的三大類。　　（一）耳性耳痛　在外耳及中耳疾病的時侯。都可發生耳痛。這種耳痛。均稱為耳性耳痛。外耳疾病，像耳翼及外聽道的外傷，急性濕疹，急性皮膚炎，耳翼匐行疹，丹毒，急性軟骨膜炎，耳血腫，耳翼及外聽道的潰瘍，急性外聽道炎　，外聽道異物，盯嚀拴，及假性珍珠腫等等。中耳疾病，像急性鼓膜炎，急性單純性及化膿性中耳炎，急性乳嘴突起炎，慢性化膿性中耳炎的急性增惡，乳嘴突起骨膜炎，及耳的惡性腫瘍等等。由這等疾病所發耳痛的性狀及强度。有種種的不同。譬如在耳翼及外聽道疾病的時候。往往因為局部的浸潤腫脹。而發生劇痛。且可從耳翼及她附近的腰迫牽引或咀嚼運動。而增强耳痛的程度。在急性中耳炎或慢性化膿性中耳炎的急性增惡的時候。耳痛大都劇烈。多為穿刺樣的疼痛。常由咀嚼，嚥下，噴嚏，咳嗽等運動而增劇。直待鼓膜一旦穿孔。或得充分的排膿後。則耳痛頓可輕緩。又可注意的。就是耳性耳痛屢能放散波及顱頂部，顳頸部，及頭部等處。這是我們應當要留意的。　　（二）放散性耳痛　放散性耳痛常可悮診為耳性耳痛。但是從她的原因疾病詳細診察起來。是不難辨別的。講到她的原因疾病。可以別為三類。卽甲，口腔疾患！如舌癌，舌的潰瘍，齲齒，智齒發生困難等等。乙，咽頭疾患—如歐氏管咽頭開口部和她附近的腫脹，咽頭癌，結核，梅毒（潰瘍），咽頭側索炎，扁桃腺炎，扁桃腺周圍炎等等。丙，喉頭疾患—如結核，癌等等。在有這等疾患的時候。她的疼痛。往往可以放散波及耳部。變為耳痛。但是耳部自己。並無病變的現象。完全是由被動放散而發的。所以稱為放散性耳痛。　　（三）神經性耳痛　神經性耳痛，常為三叉神經痛的一個分症。或在聽器各部，單獨發生神經痛。她的性狀。有持續的，發作的，及間歇的等等的耳痛。止痛的醫學（九）  李興　　有疝氣的如果忽然有劇烈疼痛不可不留意腸絞窄的危險。此時正當的止痛方法更是非常要緊的。用嗎啡鴉片是可以將病人麻醉起來呌他不曉得痛。試問用麻醉品止痛是不是含有危險性？合理的止痛法是要先顧及生命的安全後再採取適當的止痛方法，總以不妨害生命為大目的。要曉得怎樣去止這種危險的痛必須先明白腸絞紐的病理與認識病的變化。須知這種痛有時含有警吿性。現在用一個此方：美國公路與鐵路交义處多安置有大警號。每當火車行近與通過時警號就自動叮噹叮噹的饗。至於人注意這種警號與否也沒有人管。假設一個人不理會這種警號一定要開汽車越過鐵路，那末，他有時就不免要遭過粉身碎骨的慘事。　　這種痛也是一種警號，假設腸子沒有絞紐壤時當然沒有特別危險，但若是絞紐壞就不得了。絞紐壞時除止痛外須立時施行外科手術以挽救性命。萬不可單求數衍止痛拖延時間致成千古之恨。　　有人問遇見這種緊急腹痛時應當怎麼樣去止痛？打一嗎啡針或吸食鴉片可以將這種痛止住，但到底是不是正當的方法？麻醉品因麻醉神經的作用使病者覺不到痛。一個人有盲腸炎若麻醉他呌他不覺到痛，後來他的盲腸穿破引起全腹部發炎終至沉疴難挽他也不自知，這樣豈不是與檬住眼睛跳海一樣麼？　　現在科學醫學的方法卽遇見腹痛時第一就要先查出來是什麼樣的毛病呌腹痛。在不明瞭原因之前絕對不用麻醉品。如果證明了是盲腸炎就立時準備割去盲腸。在决定了施行手術，在施行手術前注射嗎啡臨時止痛也是屬於正當的方法。但不是注射了嗎啡因一時不痛就可免去外科手術。所以說較重的盲腸炎最好是動手術。動手術至少可以减去百分之九十的危險。所以外科手術也就是根本止痛的方法。　　還有一件須注意的就是平常人一有腹痛多以為服瀉藥使腹瀉一瀉就可全愈。服瀉藥為食物不消化則可，但與盲腸炎却有極大的危險。怎麼樣呢？瀉藥在腸內的作用是增加腸的蠕動。腸蠕動的越猛越快腹瀉的也越快。但是已經發炎發腫快要潰爛的盲腸經腸猛烈蠕動便立時破裂致盲腸內的膿水全流到腹腔內，腹膜炎因而發生，病危險的程度也加增十百倍。故腹痛時萬不可妄服瀉藥以送性命。　　膽石疫痛膽汁生於肝，經肝管下入膽囊，再由膽囊下經總膽管而入十二指腸。有人因身內新陳代謝作用不合正軌而生膽石。這些石子常大如蠶豆，數目由幾粒至數十粒不等。最通常生石子的地方是膽囊。其次在肝管內，有時經總膽管而入十二指腸。但石一入總膽管就發生一種很猛烈的痛。痛的地方在腹之右上部與腹之上部有時背後也覺到痛。這種痛是一陣一陣的，痛如刀刺故名為膽痠痛。痛歷數小時或數日之久患者每每呌苦連天。　　這種痛旣是短時間的當猛烈如刀刺痛時注射嗎啡亦是很正當的。其餘如用熱濕布敷腹之上部也是有益。貝拉當那與阿妥品可减去總膽管之痙孿性使總膽管收縮鬆弛使膽石快落到小腸內，膽石一到小腸內就可完全過去。以上為止膽石痠痛方法的大要。　　急性胰腺炎（Acute　Pancreatitis）胰腺是一種消化腺。胰腺在消化中也佔很重要的位置。胰是一長形腺，約重三英兩半，位於胃之下，橫過內脊骨。胰所生的消化汁是經一胰管流入十二指腸內。此管通十二指勝處是與胆管在同一終點，故胆石有時也可以阻塞胰管或胰管入十二指腸處。胰腺是一種很活動的腺，如於飯後胰腺管或受阻塞胰腺汁就可將胰腺消化去。有時胰腺稍微受傷胰汁流出也可把胰腺消化去一部分以致潰爛。　　急性胰腺炎是一種很疼痛很嚴重的毛病。因係急性炎故痛起於倉卒。痛也多起於飯後一兩小時間因飯後一兩小時間正是胰腺活動的時候！此時生出大量胰消化汁。痛是覺在腹之上部，與肚臍處，同時病者也嘔吐不止，面成土色，虛脫昏絕，病勢緊張達到一髮千鈞的地步。　　這種的痛是破壤的痛，有痛就顯明破壤正在進行，等時候越久破壞也越多，最末後腸胃也都可以消化去。如果腸胃都消化去了當然是沒有生活希望故用麻醉品止這種痛是有危險性的遷延，決不可行。唯一的治療方法是開腹使胰消化汁流出或兼用稀鹽酸使胰汁成中和性肺結核淺說  胡嘉言　　第十章　肺結核症的預後　　讀本編的人們，如果對於肺結核的症象和經過，已經有了大致的認識：那末，現在可以談談他的預後狀况了！怎樣呌做頭後呢？我們曉得，在每一個人患病就醫的時候，當頭第一重要問題，總是說：這病要緊不要緊？換句話說；就是：這病能不能痊愈？在這醫師方面，當然不能馬上貿然加以肯定否定的。但這一個問題，齊巧是包括在「預後，範圍以內的，照「預後，原文的字面解釋，是含有「預知」的意思；換句話說，就是：每一病症的經過和結局情形之預測。他的斷語，係有良，不良，極不良，不定，等種種分別的。但是我們要曉得，關於預後的斷語，决不是大衆們口耳相傳的「未卜先知」也不是舊醫們禮讚的「斷人生死」，前者固然是胡說亂道，後者也是沒有多大根據的。新醫方面預後之揣測，是完全兩樣的。他是先有了種種事實上的直正根據（病症的眞確認識）；然後方可以「已知而求未知」，用歸納的方法而下斷語的。結果卽使完全名實相符，固沒有什麼神秘的地方；萬一因症勢變化情形，捉摸不定，預後方面的斷語是不可能的，更用不着敝視。　　肺結核症的預後情形，是怎樣的斷語呢？這是非常困難的；就是極有經騐的醫者，也無不人同此戚的。我們曉得，本症是一個最複雜的病症，他的情形，幾乎是包羅萬有的。像症勢全部的住過，旣屬人人不同；種種症象的偏重，也是各自為別的；就是病症眞確的認識，也是未易言的，須用種種精密的檢查法方可了然的。這幾方面的情形，是洋見於本書七八九三章裏面的。此外，本症是很多發生其他合併症的，此中有發種是嚴重非常，有些則較次。在下預後的斷語以前，先要曉得是不是有合併症；如果有了，那末，更須曉得是何種病症；這都是重要的先决問題，醫者都應該不壓煩碎，一一加以辨別的。——所以本症預後之良與不良，决不能「簡捷了當」，整個答覆的。對於病症的究竟，像過去的症勢變化，現在的症象，以及病灶之性質，和大小多少，這種種眞想；都應該絲毫不苟，徹底明白，方足以語此的。此中的詳細答覆，现在且一一分述在下面。（未完）糞車當改良之處  沈錫元　　從衛生上着眼，處置糞便最

<p>申報本埠增刊談言傀儡皇帝溥儀訪日  行安　　「滿洲國」傀儡皇帝溥儀，前日已啟程到日本去了。關於他赴日的消息，截至現在，我們看見的已經不少，吾不必再拿他列舉出來，總之現在溥儀確是已經到了日本了。　　我們對於這次溥儀的赴日，並沒有多大的威想。我們但覺得這個傀儡皇帝一動身立刻就忙煞了好多人。一方面是偽滿官員的準備忙，戒嚴忙，歡送忙。另一方面是日本官員的準備忙，戒嚴忙，歡迎忙。還有一方面，亦有不少不相干的人，也跟着忙了記來。溥儀今番出門，我們旁人對之，雖然沒有發生什麼感想，可是他本人，一定是感想很多的。他也許是非常高興的，也許是不大願‘意的。或者他覺得很榮耀，或者他又覺得有些慚愧。總之，他的心裏，必然浮上了萬千的感想。　　關於這位身着陸軍大元帥通常禮服，襟佩大勳位菊花大綬章副和蘭花大綬章副章的偽國傀儡皇帝溥儀的御駕訪日，他身上究竟負有怎樣重大的任務，我們局外人是無從探知的。據報上載溥儀此行，打算在日本勾留二星期，除在東京訪問日皇外，就是要觀賞一下三島的春景了。這樣看來，他這回大動御駕，倒也沒有帶若什麼特殊的任務。不過從有些日人口裏傳出來的話，說溥儀赴日，對於日「滿」經濟提携的前途，關係十分重大。那麼，他的任務，却又是不小的了。　　有人說，溥儀今次親自到日本去，目的是想去謝謝聖恩。我以為這是一種胡言，溥儀自己不是一位惟我獨尊的「滿洲國」天子嗎？天子還要向誰去謝什麼聖恩呢。覺夫護國寺  覺夫　　——故都雜寫——　　這是一個佔地四五十畝的大廟。在若干年前，這里每年也許曾養活過不少出家人的生命，蹈過不少善男信女的脚跡；但是，現在呢，香火早已斷絕了，僧尼早已走散了，堂皇的建築，魁偉的佛像，也早已坍倒殘敗了。遺留在庭院中的幾棵凋松枯柏，寂寞地聳立在那里，好像是在對着行人，伸訴着它們過去的一段光榮的歷史似的。如果是在薄霧迷濛的黃昏，獨自蹈着淡紅的夕昭，到這殘破的廢墟上來徘徊着，舉頭看看七橫八堅的梁楝，東傾西斜的斷墻殘壁，老在松柏的枯枝上，一聲聲哀啼着的烏鴉，盡管你是個多麼忍心的人，這時恐也禁不住不起了今昔之感的！　　大槪是市民們看不慣這寂寞的塲面吧，這頹敗了的破廟，現在竟作為一個定期的市塲來了。　　『到護國寺去吧！』現在如果聽見這樣的話，準保不會有人聯想到進香禮佛這些事情上面去，因為『護國寺』這名字，在人們的腦子中，早已和『東安』，『西單』，……這些熱鬧的商業區連結在一起了。　　是在每月逢七逢八這幾個開市的日子吧，在這兒，攤子就直從山門起，緊緊地排列到廟宇的後梢。這中間，有賣解的，有說書的，有要拳棒的，有舊貨攤，新貨攤，有茶座，有露天戲塲，……凡是日常的用品，平民化的各種娛樂，都件件俱備；看來宛像一個龐大的，兼有游藝塲的百貨公司一樣。如果袋中有十多枚銅元，擠入露天戲塲聽一回戲，到說書塲聽一回說書，探探頭看一回變戲法，要拳棒，……那一天的時光，就能這樣舒舒適適地打發過去了。　　在這里，各種買賣的價目，是比旁的地方平宜一點的；就做買賣的人的品性，也好像比旁的地方的人老實些。商人們所特有的巧詐，在這兒是很少看見的。有一回，我在一個舊攤上買信封，花二毛錢，竟買得一百多費。生着滿顎鬍子的攤主，另外還包了一大打墓古的信封送給我說：　　『你拿去用吧，這是很好玩的！』　　我打開來數一數，一共就七八十隻。自己花了一二毛錢，得了這麼多的報酬，便宜是便宜的了，但敎人虧本這麼多，實也有些過意不去。所以我對他說　　『要送就送幾隻別的，這種名貴的信封，我用不着！』　　但是，他仍舊在堅持着他的意見：　　『要是別的，我也不送了！——不要緊，你拿去吧！』　　看樣子，這傢伙大槪也是因摹古慕壞了，才致銷路不大好的吧。但是，他寗願用來當為贈品贈與顧客，不願降低價格出賣，這也是怪得有趣的。大槪在一般未曾到過北平的人的腦子中，一想起『故都』這名字，總會述帶地想及這種老實得有點近於傻的人物來的吧。但其實，這種有趣的人，在這一個現代化的古城里，也並非到處都可以碰見的，護國寺之所以尚有這種人遺留着，也正就是在表明着這一個商業塲所，還是帶着濃郁的古代味的。　　因為這里有這數點的特色，一到了開市的日子，觀光者和顧客們，就像潮水似的；一大羣從這面擁上去，一大羣又從那邊擠下來；變戲法者的銅鑼聲，買唱者的胡琴聲，要拳棒者的吆喝聲，舊貨攤的拍賣聲，就把整個天空攪擾得一團昏亂。　　『誰說護國寺是冷落的？』看看這熱鬧的情形，是誰也會這麼的懷疑着的。　　但是，熱鬧的市集一完結了，寂寞的陰影，又漸漸地在這廢墟上擴展開來……枯萎的松柏，老在那兒默守着坍倒的宮殿，令人生厭的烏鴉，老在那兒凄切地哀啼着，……　　寂寞的護國寺，依舊是寂寞的！嘯天獅  方之中　　美妙的風水陶醉了老人的心靈，因此他感傷地瞪着濯濯山原又發舊夢。　　朦朧間，那古松閃着騎士胳膊的拱衛，那綠蔭黯黯地天織的一幅錦帳，那叢脞的蔓草紫荊為獅身裝點的外衣，那激越的風笛，那琤琮的幽泉，那可嗅得出的地氣蒸發的香氛，可聽得見的龍在爬行的行聲音，那……活龍活脈！活龍活脈！　　這一切全從他無感覺的眼珠子上飛過去。　　（「嘯天獅」這名詞眞不錯！是一隻雄獅，他在呼嘯，就是山神也在呼嘯，在呼嘯的震動弦上，先靈的遺骸是詡詡地生存着的；這奕奕的精神，便是自己一家人今後富貴榮華的血液！……絕大的氣運到來，至遲…至遲…）　　「有誰領會得到」！老人照例的對準自己大腿上一拍，自豪對風水有獨到的境地。但他一意識到映在眼簾的祖墳山「嘯天獅」仍只是些淺草矮樹時，對何新爺的盜伐樹木，更增强了他「警一戒百」和報復主義的意念。　　水磨骨金黃羅針盤，指針盪漾地像一道橫在江心的浮橋，指針在不住的搖曳，老人的心也在不住的戰慄，他担心這墓地復興的根緣，意外地遭了何新爺的摧殘。放下羅計盤，爛熟地把地理書</p>
<p>Page 22</p>
<p>中某一段咀嚼一遍，接着屈着指頭一算，這是「忌月」呀！這是「忌月」呀！抬起頭，被盜的幾株小松槐上的油水和粉屑，彷彿是先人的糢糊的而肉，涔涔的淚水！　　（活獅在掙扎，山神在呌喊，視宗在毒駡，駡誰？駡不孝的子孫——自己！）　　不孝！多麼大的罪名！假如這一趟再放過這些傢伙，那眞白做一世人，眞對不住地下的宗祖！於是把積壓的——連上次×××恊會强伐古樹的怒火，都全準備集中何新爺來燃燒。他把幾根疏落的麻白鬍鬚一捋、决定這樣答復午後來的和事老；　　　　至低得放鞭封山，担保三年內人口沒有疾病損害，否則送他坐牢去！　　憤然地把羅針盤裝入小靑布袋，鼓着衷殘的力掙起身來，拐着一根木杖轉到左側山麓上，細細撫摸那塊不知躺過多少年代的「犀牛望月石」。從那石上給風雨剝蝕的斑痕想到現在圯頽的山貌，凋零的人勢，他俯着頭，悻然而又潛然地淌下兩滴淸淚。隨後便蹣跚地尋着荒草殗殜的小徑走回家去。　　午餐時分，彷彿祖宗撬緊了老人的咽喉，飯也不想吃，經過老婆兒子再三勸慰，才走棹旁，剛一擎起碗，手一滑，碗碎然摔到地上，飯和碗屑紛飛在滿屋子裏。　　「媽的！這不是好兆頭啦！何新爺那雜種非嚴辦不可。快給我安排包裹！」　　飯沒吃成，老婆兒子急得儘揑着大腿。這時和事老汪團總和蔡戶長走進門了。蔡戶長有一張善于詞令的嘴，一進門便說着「久遂」和問候老人健康的話；汪團總也隨腔應板的來應酬，這使老人不得不轉笑臉歡迎了。他們喝過茶，便把話轉到正題：　　「何新爺不懂事，我們罵過好一趟。開爹，請你看在我們面上，馬虎點兒罷？」蔡戶長怪溫和地說。　　「應當，應當！不過上次我墳山的樹木伐得精光，結果我大兒子死了。這次再不能馬虎，至低得放鞭封山，担保三年內我一家再沒損傷！」老人吃吃地回答。　　汪團總接着說：「担保…我們可負不了這大的責任。」　　「那可不行，非送他坐牢去不可！」老人堅决地搖着頭。　　絕望的空氣逼着他們，便帶着不自然的笑辭了老人而去。老人喊着克子快把包裹拿出來。練江上  拓人　　春天的鄉村旅行，是會使人的心情燃燒着瑩瑩地熱力的。　　是午後，太陽的柔光，眩耀着人的眼睛在大地上跳躍。火車到了龍井，車站上就變成了熱鬧的市鎭，鄉下人的那種喧隻的聲音，在車站四週的每個角落裏響着。　　走出了車站的月豪們，沿着碎石子的小路走去，約莫有幾百步遠，就是開往練江上游去的輪船底船埠了。　　龍井港雖沒有航行大海的船隻，也沒有通商口岸那種建築得很壯觀的碼頭；可是却有着海關，規模很大的關卡。在岸邊，巡查的警士，個個都放大着脚步在走動，眼睛好似做賊般的注視着那些上下船的旅客的身上合行李。原因是龍井港可以一直的通出海外，報上常載的某國人在沿海私運貨品入潮的地方，這裏就是他門常走的路。　　兇猛的潮濤，從那緊夾着山峯的小港衝進來。水色是桃紅的，好似是一領紅色的毛鵝絨，蓋罩着這龍井港。當潮水又退回海去的時候，那廣闊的水面，會露出了一片片紅色的沙泥，好像船行在大海中，所着見的那大魚的腹，滾起在水面上，閃耀着太陽的金光。　　向練江上游去的小汽輪的是在午後就開行了。約莫有一個多鐘頭，才走進了練江。水也漸漸地由紅變綠。假如是站在一個較高的山峯上向下俯視，這條小河流的蜿延曲折，就好似一條放在地下的銀練，從上至下的在流着平靜地淸泉。水是一片的碧綠，沒有半點的波紋的有如一面用白粉擦過的玻璃那樣的光滑。綠色的竹叢、很茂盛地擁抱着兩岸，有的枝枒伸長在空間緊接着，倒印在水面上是一片黑色的陰影。假如舉頭向上望，廣漠的天海，變成了一條極小的銀河，與下面的綠水相暉映着。　　坐在船艙裏的人，到了中途的時候，一個個都爬上甲板來，談話的聲音，會像機輪，聲饗一樣，震動着這靜穆地河流的兩岸上的村莊。　　都市裏的人，是很少看到鄉村間的茅屋的，在這裏，却像展覽會一樣的擺現出幾個世紀以來的各色各樣的房屋。幾百年前遺存下來的石橋，走過的鄉下人，也對着這些站在甲板上的人們呆望，似乎是在說：鄉下有什滬好玩？　　船在江中行了幾點鐘後，兩岸上現出了很多破舊的房屋，高的矮的都成廢墟地躺在原野上。據船裏的鄉下人說：在幾年前這還是一個很熱鬧的村莊。近幾年，旱災水災弄得這裏都無人居住了。　　鄉下人說起話來是滔滔不絕的。他說着廢墟，又說着那原野上的田地。他繼續說：鄉下人是靠每年的收成的，你們看着岸上的那樣好的一片綠色稻笛，以為收成一定是好的。可是好年成的收獲還不够還債呢，所以現在連人都跑光了，種田人是少得多了。　　平靜的練江，美麗的練江，雖然它灌溉了無數的田野，但它給與鄉下人的恩惠，却是只有幾個得到。離別  胡慰雄　　隔夜和主人談天到　夜，遠遠的聽梆子聲打了三更，纔互道晚安歸寢。鄉間，夕陽西斜，已是炊烟四起，預備晚餐的時候了。往常用了飯後，老太太吸過一通水煙袋，虔誠地在佛龕前供上一柱香，就闔了眼睛，把一百另八顆佛珠繞在左腕上，低聲喃喃地誦經，右手掄着佛珠作數，大約一小時公德完事。我的小朋友在這個時間內溫讀祖母早上敎識的方塊字。那孩子很聰敏，許多筆劃較多或近乎相似的字讀過之後很少有認錯的時候。有時我們也講故事，及玩着他爸爸為他購來的敎育六面畫。自己雖然是個大孩子了、而且在生活之浪中學得了一些所謂做人的藝術。但是兩個月來孩和我混得很厮熟、他並沒有覺得我已是超過了做他伴侶的年齡！或許我的寶貴底稚氣沒有被巨浪吞噬殆盡吧？在這短短的養病期中、我記了兩厚册日記、每天能寫上近千字，這種勇氣被遺棄了許久許久了！里面十之七是記載着扶杖漫遊的情況，而記念我童心的復活亦上二萬字。如今這兩册日記我今藏在箱篋內。　　自從孝女寺之遊後，我不復再敢探訪勝景，知足常樂，我要把這極好的影像深藏在我的腦海里，永遠像親臨其地一樣地鮮明。而况我的假期亦近了、這顆脫了覊絆的心又將送到巨浪中去磨厲！三天之前我吿訴了主人歸期，老太太彷彿從前不忍兒子遠離的時候，計劃了許多近乎哄孩子的方法延長我的行期；自小被野風吹大了的我，幾乎想長居在母愛的暖房中了。當初一個旅客似地投宿到這異鄉的旅舍，誰料小朋友送我到埠頭的時候我吊了幾滴淸淚呢，在狂風巨浪從沒有滴過的淸淚呵！　　昨天午後我把帶來的書籍及簡單的行裝稍事整理，主人坐在窗前把紙吹燒盡了沒有想吸一袋煙、我竭力沉着頭避去她的視綫，但是那種壓迫的空氣使偎在祖母膝前孩子半嚮沒有舉動，最後我拉了孩子到附近去散步，勉强把太陽送回西山。　　昨夜晚餐特別豐盛、主人更把玫瑰花片浸着的酒勸飲、自己不知所以地盡了三杯，一點沒有酒醉的現象、平常恐怕早已不省人事了。餐罷、孩子捧了字盒出來的時侯，主人吩咐他自己拿積木來玩。，捧着水烟袋和我嘮嘮叨叨談起天來。主人本是健談的，可是昨天儘是重覆着二次以上舊事，紙吹一支支繼續着、上香的佛事都忘了。黃媽不時從應門後探頭窺望，她或者驚異着我們主客兩人的失了常態吧？　　精神異常興奮，簡直忘了睡眠這回事、聽見三更的梆子聲底時候，主人纔驚訝地、：「怎末？三更了！」這樣結束了我們的談話。　　回到臥室，始終沒有想睡的意思，把放進了旅行提箱里的日記簿取出來，溫習着，直到不能再支持疲憊的時候伏案睡着了。　　早上黃媽吿訴我太太昨夜受了感冒，今天不能起床，令她的孫兒送我到埠頭。我很想到她臥室辭行，但是我敏威地想到了要是主人好端端地坐着吸水烟袋呢？請黃媽代訴了逕自離別這兩個月來彷彿家似地溫暖的友人之居！自我職業介紹　　方熙君，現十九歲，常州人，小學程度，曾供職某大旅社，現亟思獲得茶役，西崽或自由車送貨送信人，或看門，接聽電話等職，希望月薪十餘元，請卽賜函上海西門，安瀾路八十六號居宅轉交。　　某君，現在某夜校攻讀，願於日間祖任抄寫，校對或繪畫廣吿助理員等職，待遇不計，通訊處卡德路一九九弄六號金徽先生轉交。　　某君，粵人，年三十二，舊制中學畢業，能操國語及粵滬方言，工小楷，能撰稿，熟悉公文程式，善寫鋼筆版，歷任小學校長，敎員及各機關，社團，律師書記等職，現願就上項職務，外埠亦可，具有舖保，通訊處閘北獎家宅路一七三號陳書記轉。　　顧超華君，江蘇人，年十九，高中程度，曾習新聞學，現願任報館通訊社或文化機關練習生職，津貼不計，具有股實舖保，合意者請函本市小西門陸家浜中華職業學校。　　楊方良君，浙江諸曁人，年二十五歲，高小畢業，幼時專習西樂，中文粗通，略知英語，曾任孤兒院軍樂隊敎導，順康洋行收發，現急欲謀一相當位置，如有學校需用軍樂敎導助手或公司機關收發人員以及茶役等職，均願擔任，薪金不計，通訊處法租界亞爾培路錢家塘吳家弄八十一號。　　徐君，寗波人，年二十七歲，中學畢業，前曾任公司行號賬席，並在某機關服務會計三年，對於中西賬略及珠算等頗有經騐，現願就上項職務，薪水不計，備有殷實舖保，如欲需用者請函至閘北新民路來安里三號。　　某君，年二十三，能操國語及閩滬方言，中學程度，曾任商號司賬有年，今願就公司機關職員或書記抄寫員等職，倘無上項使務，其他位置亦可，通訊處本埠呂班路萬宜坊六十四號二樓亭子間葉君轉。無綫電播音節目彈詞　　蔣如庭朱介生落霞孤驚　　中西（一〇四〇）下午一時至一時三刻　　開篇「春色」　　春回大地氣象新。拂拂和風陶醉人。你看那桃花紅。紅噴噴。楊柳綠。綠沉沉。更有麥苗碧波靑。寒梅開放行將謝。水仙含苞剛吐芬。滿園春色關不住。芳草滿庭綠似茵。見那紅男綠女成羣結。盡是遊山玩水踏靑大。天眞孩童曠野去。臨空引綫放風箏。春分節近社日。道旁寡婦上新墳。哭聲震天神為傷。如怨如慕動人魂。古人夜宴桃李園。所以春色最宜人。及時行樂無傷鴉。對此春色興更增。鄉人俗例把春牛打。說道今年五榖盡豐登。然而農村破產不堪言。豐年還比荒年貧。苛捐雜稅頻頻加。垂死農民苦不勝。無衣無食實可憐。我為農民來請命。願吾袞袞諸君子。速把農村來復興。諸君際此春光中。各宜努力向前程。一歲四季春為首。一日之計在於晨。一年之計在於春。歌唱　　上海歌劇社　　東陸（六四〇）下午五時三刻至六時三刻　　連環担（前奏曲）因為你太美（周璇）薔薇之歌（林鶯）國花（姚莉）關外高歌（徐健）城市之光（林鶯）好妹妹（姚莉）歸程（徐健）薔薇之蕊（周璇）　　新新（七八〇）下午七時至八時　　漢宮秋月（前奏曲）我們的皇后（周璇）逍遙調（徐健）擱樓上的小姐（林鶯）休息五分鐘（黃韻）情伴（姚莉）吹泡泡（周璇）漂泊者（徐健）你的一笑（林鶯）一封快信（黃韻）園裏圍外（姚莉）　　大中華（一一六〇）下午八時至九時　　餓馬搖鈴（前奏曲）夜深深（嚴斐）我願意（葉英）紙窗夜雨（黃韻）誰和我玩（葉紅）開路先鋒（嚴斐）桃李刦（葉英）春朝曲（黃韻）王女士的鷄（葉紅）　　永生（一〇八〇）下午九時至十時　　倒垂簾（前奏曲）衣戰塲（嚴裴）市上上歌（葉英）蝴蝶姑娘（黃韻）文明結婚（葉紅）晚香玉（嚴斐）漁光曲（葉英）圈兒信（黃　）勇士凱歌（葉紅）　　曼社　　國華（一二〇〇）下午六時至六時三刻　　（一）音樂（二）長記得（三）丁香山（四）慈母搖藍曲（五）夢來香（六）快樂家庭（七）開始的一吻（八）甜蜜的　　富星（九二〇）下午七時半至八時一刻　　丁丁當太太（曼英）寄給父親的詩（曼雄）蘇山不要哭（曼傑）我的妹妹（曼英）摩登戀愛（曼傑）花想容（曼雄）我要你的一切（曼英）南海美人（曼傑）口琴、沈志淸）　　敦本（八〇〇）下午九時至十時　　因為你太美（曼英）休息五分鐘（曼傑）紫蘭羅（曼雄）我要你的一切（曼英）丁香山（曼雄）雙料情人（曼傑）娘子軍（曼雄）城市之光（曼傑）口琴（沈志淸）　　飛音社　　中西（一〇四〇）下午六時至七時　　從軍別愛（俞月明）銀漢雙　（曼娜）戀愛歌（露茜）瞎子瞎算命（佈德）燕雙飛（金儀）大地行軍曲（淸風）歡迎聽衆點唱　　玫瑰團　　華美（一〇六〇）下午六時一刻至七時　　走馬（前奏）天倫之愛張如）可愛的中華（奧芳）開始的一吻（曼麗）後臺（周恭文仙）英雄夫婿（張如）小姐我要你一切（玲玲）警鐘（雯仙）　　安定（八六〇）下午十時至十一時　　水東流（前奏）山中美人（曼麗）知音之愛（張如）滿江紅（吳芳）小茉莉（雯仙）鐵馬金戈（張如）春朝曲（玲玲）侮蘭桃香（曼麗）　　明月社　　建華（七四〇）下午七時至八時　　甜心妹妹（白虹）紅豆新詩（英茵）淸雅令（白虹）走近前來（楊露茜）夜戰塲（英茵）花心曲（白虹）誰和我玩（楊露茜白虹）黃昏（英茵）給歌郎（黃瓊英）風雨琴歌（白虹）　　李樹德（九四〇）下午九時至九時三刻　　新漁光曲（白虹）鐘聲（

<p>申報本埠增刊　電影專刊出身低徵的歐美名導演  朱橫　　導演在影藝中可算是最重要的工作，它需要生活的經騐，和製片各部門的知識。歐美許多赫赫有名的大導演大都從低微的職業奮鬥出來，甚至有許多現在的紅導演並非出身於影界的。有的只是從事於舞臺的滑稽劇述舞台劇都不曾幹過的亦不乏共人。　　大名鼎鼎的劉別謙，遠在一九一三年，他在柏林當一個滑稽演員。因為當時他感到所演的戲缺乏適當的材料，所以就决意自己編劇本，並擔任導演。那次的嘗試居然給他成功了，公司方面因此也信任了他，而指派他編導兼主演一部兩本的喜劇短片。後來他在導演波拉尼格萊Pola　Neger的「卡門」時，他便拋棄了短片而做喜劇的導演了。　　法朗克卡普拉Frank　Capra從前是在專門攝製滑稽短片的哈羅起Hal　Roach　and　Mack　Sennet影片公司做滑稽演員。當著名的滑稽演員哈理蘭敦决定演長片時，就請卡普拉導演「强漢」The　Strong　Man而他的這一處女作曾被選為一九二六年十大巨片之一。　　「羅馬快車」和辱華巨片Jack　Ahoy的英國大導演華德福特Walter　Forde從前是個音樂團的演奏家。戰後他纔傾其所有的積蓄投入影界。結果導演了一本喜劇短片，雖然不幸破產，可是後來却因導演了一部長片Wonld　yor　BelieveIt？而成名。　　法朗鮑才琪在開始的時候，是專門導演美國西部生活片子的，後來，他却慢慢地轉變而成為著名的傷感戀愛片的導演聖手。其名作有「七重天」和MankCastle等。　　西席地密爾的第一次作品是The　Squaw　Man「淚海」這是一九一三年在好萊塢第一部攝製的片子。同年也就是他和傑賽拉斯基氏開始創立這派拉蒙公司的時候。　　法朗羅耶Frauk　Lloyd也是個電影界的先驅。一九一三年他在「人生的暗影」Shadows　of　Life中只做一個初上鏡頭的演員。後來就擔任短片的編劇者和導演。　　桃羅賽亞茨納Dorothy　Arzner是好萊塢女導演中之一，她在擔任導演以前，只是個接片員，後因得公司的信任而充導演。其處女作為「婦女的時髦」Fashions　for　Women。　　喬治古格George　Cukor可算是當代許多導演中的後起之秀，其傑作為「小婦人」。他的處女作係百老匯的貴族家庭」The　Royal　Fanily　of　Broadway。無疑的，他導演此片是再適當沒有了，因為他是紐約著名的舞臺監督。其實他在「百老匯的貴族家庭」一片中並非他第一次工作，因為他已經替「西綫無戰事」寫過很多的對白了。　　英國巨片「獨裁者」The　Dictator的大導演維克多莎菲爾Victor　Saville在戰前是個影片商。後來就替美國油公司導演一部廣吿影片而開始他的影片生活。他正式導演的片子是一部呌做Woman　to　Woman的默片。　　法國名導演雷尼克萊Rene　Clair在一九二二年前還沒有進影界時，是個新聞記者。其處女作為The　Orazy　Ray其成名的傑作卽為「意大利的草帽」。德國名導演G.W.柏伯斯G.W.Pabst是文藝電影「唐吉訶德」，「互助」和「白地獄」的大導演，他是在德國導演了嘉寶主演的「無聊之街」The　Joyless　Stree以後才享盛名的。影片談評評「蓬島一枝花」  尤兢　　Red　Morning—大上海映　　以南海的薰風熱浪，蓬島的麗色綺影為主要背景的影片，與其謂為滿足勞碌于寫字間，同時又懨膩了舞塲嬌窟的紳士們的娛樂的想求，倒不如說是一般被黃金貨物窒息得透不轉氣來的人，企望着再發現什麼新島，使他們有所作為，這一想念的反映。這從「香屑海」，「蓬島春光」，「珍珠島」「英雌歷險記」以及目前開映的這「蓬島一枝花」，都可以作如是觀的。雖然在這些影片中看上去好像是不曾主觀或直接地作露骨的表現，可是有意無意地適應着這些要求乃是顯然的。　　例如這「蓬島一枝花」，表面雖然是在戀愛的外衣下，表現了一個壤人到頭終必自滅的說敎故事；但在他那以南海荒島土人生活為穿挿的致力描寫中，却淸楚地暗示着這個出路的。譬如劇作者在片中以船主白萊莎的女兒卡蘭給土人打藥水針，把會長的兒子瑪約從死後救活為主要的關鍵，以指示她從俘虜地位而取得上賓的資格。又强調了放燄火的足以駭退千萬武裝的土人，讓卡蘭單身救出將被土人焚燒的情夫約翰，以及卡蘭只須擊板發聲，給土人的守候者擊鼓傳了出去，便有成千成萬的土人持矛駕舟來救她等塲面，都暗示了對於那些荒島中的土人，白人是如何容易地與他們發生關係，或者說忠厚無用的土人是如何急待着文明人去征服的。　　「蓬島一枝花」除了這些以外，我們從技術方面來看時，並不是怎樣了不起的作品。我們可以先打個比喻說！「蓬島一枝花」這片子的素材，弄得好本來可以製成一株樸素多姿，孤芳自賞的梅花的，可是現在却被弄成一枝出於十分平庸的花匠之手的盆景了。　　但這裏還有一些荒島土人的沉重的皮鼓聲和單純樸素的歌聲與步舞，以及野燎與茂林這些畫而與聲音的野趣。可是潑刺，獷野與强悍這些應有的動作，都由於剪接之不善，也非常的表現不够。所謂剪接不善，主要的是太亂，如土人來助卡蘭夫婦與壞人史丹幹等鬥爭的三方面的描寫時，就亂得失去了應有的緊急情緒，常用長長的遠景，以致减弱了短急的旋律。前而寫船觸礁後，應該是極快的調子的，但竟讓卡蘭提着燈兒悠悠地找尋失去的父親。　　比較成功的是情感流露的地方，在船觸礁的前一刻之晚問，卡蘭對父親的憶舊，父親死前與葬後的幾塲戲，以及和瑪約分別時，這些地方，都極成功地打動了觀衆，獲得了極好的效果。這並非導演華臘司福斯成功的手術，而是要歸功于女主角史蒂菲竇娜的。照她的面貌和身材而論，實在是以演凄凉素妍的角色，勝于航海探險的女英雄的，觀於這兒的成功與失敗之處，便是一個明證了。拍外景發現真正的桃花江　　幾天前天一攝影隊在滬西一帶拍「重歸」外景，在桃花林的前面，有一條小江，淸波綠水，風景異常幽美。我們平時愛唱「桃花江」，總以為「桃花江」是理想的；殊一不知今天拍戲的地方，却是眞眞的「桃花江」了！「彩虹曲」公映有期  雲山　　柯特妮瑛Cicely　Courtneidge，是歐洲舞台上和銀幕上的一個怪物，人家都叫她女卓別林，她所主演的片子，在上海映過的，有「梅柳江春」，「疑雲疑雨」，「杏花天」等片。這三部片子，在上海初次公映時，都曾得着很好的譽論，現在，我們又將看到她的新作品「彩虹曲」Aunt　Sally。和「梅柳江春」一樣，它也是一部帶有滑稽性的歌舞片。柯特妮琪，在這裏飾一位醉心歌舞藝術的姑娘。起初因為她不是一個有聲望的女伶，所以屢遭班主摒槳不用，但是她並不灰心，仍舊很努力的想盡方法，去祖任戲裏的主角，所謂有志者事竟成，終於獲得了最後的勝利。　　全片純用新鮮滑稽的材料組織而成，其中更有幾個歌舞塲面，非常新穎美麗，一切均不亞於柯特妮琪以前的作品，聞不日將出映於光陸云。天一化絮  白芸　　高梨痕病尚未痊。　　沈勇石七日前得一千金。　　蕭正中在「重歸」中飾醫生。　　新人林翠芳，余英均在「重歸」中演出了。　　據王斌說「母親」分幕工作日內即可吿竣。　　今年度預定開拍之新片中，將有一片全部以「海」為背景者。　　天一决努力培植新人，現正研究採取何種方針。　　「重歸」中之歌曲，亦將印就分贈各界。　　「重歸」，中之市街一幕，因雨尚未開拍。　　「重歸」中「艷陽天」一曲，富有詩意，極為婉轉動人。　　拍「重歸」醫院一幕，陳謨兒科醫院醫士數人前來參觀，對於一切設備佈置均極滿意。電影小說業餘記者（After　Office　Hours）（四）  彤雲　　彭尼斯德低着頭，將嘴凑在他耳邊道：「那是誰？我沒有會見過，你提我一提。」雪倫笑道：「或者他亦沒有看見過你，不過說說罷了。他是新聞紀載報的總編輯，傑姆勃郎却。他說認識你，或者是有用意的，你得小心些，……」彭尼斯德道：「雪倫，我想你不至於相信外面的謠言吧。」這時柏德森夫人，珠麗亞，看着他們二人正談得親密，未免醋意勃發。她却笑着駡雪倫道：「雪倫，你吊膀子的功夫倒眞不差。」　　傑姆偷偷看了柏德森夫人一眼，知道她心中的隱痛。這雖不關他的事，他却為她可憐。他念頭一轉，又走到雪倫那各脫的身旁，淡淡然若無其事的說道。。「明天早晨你到報館的時候，先到我的辦公室來。我要派你做一件特別的事。別的都不興，我想你做得一定好的。」雪倫不肯，她說：「世界上沒有第二件事可做，我亦不替你工作了。」這時院內鈴響了，最後一幕要上塲了，大家聚着談話的，都散了開來，紛紛進塲，各歸自己的坐位。傑姆却沒有進塲，他去打了一個電話到報館裏，呌賬房取消把停止雪倫那各脫工作的命令。給她每星期五十元的薪水。　　那天晚上，雪倫很晚的回到家裏，因為戲館散後，彭尼斯德又帶她去吃銷夜。那時祇有他們二人，彭尼斯德就在雪倫身上，用了一番功夫，花言巧語的吿訴她，他怎樣的愛了她很久了，將來亦將永久的愛她，但望將來有這麼一天，她自己發現了她亦是愛他的。雪倫聽了，得意非凡的眼睛裏發出光輝來。她到了家裏，她聽見她的母親，正和一個男子談着話。她一路想着彭尼斯德聽說的愛，到家的時候，心中還覺得有些得意揚揚。忽然她的母親喊住了她道：「雪倫！」雪倫走了進去，那男子原來就是傑姆勃郎却。她的母親道：「雪倫，怎麼你從來沒有和我提過勃郎却先生怎樣好法！」她說着，站了起來道：「我再去弄些咖啡來。」她說完了，就很知趣地走了開來。　　雪倫就在沙發上坐了下去，徐徐解着她肩上國的狐狸。傑姆走了過來，蹭在她的面前道：「雪倫，你聽我的話，回到報館裏來。我要叫你寫重要的新聞哩。如同今天晚上開慕第一夜所見的形形色色，都描寫出來，使社交界的人，都覺得他們是身壓其境的。寫些那七十多歲的老珠寶商人，每逢第一晚總要帶了他那位九十五歲的母親，去看一次戲的，還有許多社會上有名的人，如同海爾辛哩，倫斯登哩，還有珠麗亞柏德森和湯梅彭尼斯德在一起……」　　雪倫連忙爭辯道：「和珠麗亞柏德森在一起的，是亨利柏德森，湯梅彭尼斯德不過是他們的朋友。故意造作謠言，是可恥的，你說是不是？」傑姆聽了，一言不發地走到大菜檯上，檢了兩隻蘋果，和三隻橘子，捧在懷裏，笑着對雪倫道：「我是一下子生了五個孩子的母親，你來訪問我吧。」雪倫嘴彎着，欲笑不笑的看着他，他活像一個大孩子，怪討氣的，拿他有什麼法子呢？她不覺說道：「怪可憐的。」傑姆裝了女人的喉嚨道：「這算不了什麼。任何人處於我的地位，都要這樣的。」他說着，一隻蘋果從他懷裏滾了下來。傑姆喊道：「勵，密得麗跌下去了。」那隻蘋果一滾，滾到沙發底下去了，傑姆連忙跪下去尋，但是他懷中所有的都渡下來了。（未完）</p>

<p>Guiyang—The communist bandits in Guizhou Province are still retreating eastward, trying their best to avoid contact with the government forces. After being defeated near Xifeng, the bandits initially retreated southeast, then turned southwest, then again southeast, and then eastward to within 20 li of Guiding (transliteration). Hearing that government forces were stationed there, they turned northwest and fled, crossing the Wu River this morning. Many drowned. This group of bandits is now moving rapidly eastward, hoping to join forces with the bandit group led by He Long. The bandits are moving busily in the mountains, their purpose clearly being to avoid contact with government forces at all costs. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>(Changsha) Li Zongbao cabled the province from Yongxing on the 3rd to surrender. The cable was sent on his behalf by the county government. The original cable is as follows: Chairman and concurrently Security Commander He Jun: I, Zongbao, was forced into the wrong path by the communist bandits when I was not yet a young man. Over the years, I have acted perversely and accumulated many faults. Later, I felt the errors of the communist bandits' policies and mourned the peril of the nation. I believe that if we want to save China, there is no other way than to follow the Three Principles of the People. I have repeatedly wanted to leave the Red Army and serve the country, but I have been hampered by the strict supervision of the communist bandits and the obstruction of outside news. Until now, there has been no suitable opportunity to fulfill my aspirations. I hope for your pardon. This time, thanks to the recruitment of your envoy, I, Zongbao, went through many twists and turns and dangers to finally lead a company out of the sea of bitterness on the 1st. I am grateful for the excellent treatment given by Staff Officer Yang and County Magistrate Wu, and I am deeply ashamed. Zongbao respectfully offers his hot blood and dares not fail to exhaust his strength to follow you and repay your kindness. My wishes are as follows: 1. I will always support the Chinese Kuomintang and be the vanguard in suppressing bandits and eliminating communism, and prepare for the struggle against foreign aggression. 2. I am willing to take responsibility for recruiting and pacifying the remaining bandits in the Xiangnan border area to stabilize the local area. With all my sincerity, I humbly beg for your inspection and instructions. Li Zongbao bows respectfully. (Central News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>

<h3 id="e5">Fujian Provincial Committee, Lin Zhiyuan Arrives in Beijing Yesterday, Discusses Recent Situation in Fujian and Xiamen <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Lin Zhiyuan of the Fujian Provincial Committee arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 7th to discuss approximately two tasks: (1) To ask Chairman Lin to change the Fuzhou Mingluntang into a Zhongshan Hall. After President Sun Yat-sen resigned as Provisional President, he went to Fuzhou, where he gathered comrades and the masses in the province to explain his doctrine. This hall has been one of the places where the revolution originated. After years of disrepair, Chairman Lin once proposed rebuilding it as a Zhongshan Hall. Through the efforts of provincial and local figures, approximately 50,000 yuan has been raised, but the total construction cost is still insufficient. It is proposed to ask the central government for a small subsidy. (2) The budget for education expenses in Fujian Province is 1.44 million yuan per year. This sum is transferred from the salt tax to the national treasury and then allocated by the national treasury. Later, due to bandit and communist disturbances, the salt tax revenue fell short, and only 110,000 yuan was issued each month. At that time, the bandit areas had not been recovered, and the number of schools had decreased, so it could barely be maintained. Now, the counties in eastern, western, and northern Fujian have all been recovered, and the salt tax has returned to its original state, and the expenditure on education has also returned to its original state. The Education Expense Management Committee has pushed for a trip to Beijing, requesting the central government to continue allocating 120,000 yuan per month for education expenses in the entire province. He had an appointment with Finance Minister Kong in Shanghai, and they will meet in Beijing next Tuesday to discuss the matter face-to-face. After meeting with Chairman Chiang and Finance Minister Kong, he will stay in Beijing for a week and then return to Fujian. Fujian's political situation is gradually getting on the right track. After Chairman Chen took office, he managed it in stages. The first stage, in 1934, was dedicated to stability work. The second stage, in 1935, which is this year, is dedicated to rectification work. The third stage, in 1936, is dedicated to construction work. Stability work has been effective, and rectification work is underway. It is expected that there will also be satisfactory results by the end of the year. The financial situation has improved compared to before. The total annual expenditure of the province is approximately 20 million yuan, and the revenue is over 18 million yuan, with a deficit of only over 2 million yuan. The largest expenditure is the security expenses of the entire province, which requires 5 million yuan. The Director of Finance originally intended to tighten security expenses to match revenue and expenditure, but Chairman Chen is hesitant, fearing that tightening will affect stability work. Director Xu is currently traveling from Shanghai to Zhenhai and will come to Beijing in a day or two. As for the use of the 8 million yuan of construction bonds issued, 3 million yuan will be used for construction and the remaining 5 million yuan will be used to consolidate the old debts of the provincial treasury. Negotiations are currently underway. The atmosphere of bandits in Fujian is now cleared in eastern and northern Fujian, with only scattered remnants of bandits in western Fujian, which will not be difficult to eliminate. Order has also been restored in various places, but the vitality of the people needs considerable time to recover. The opium dens and gambling houses run by Taiwanese in Fuzhou have been negotiated to be banned. As a result, Fuzhou ordered all of them to close by the end of March. Due to various reasons, Xiamen has not yet achieved the purpose of banning them, but it is being done gradually. The Japanese Navy is also largely unsympathetic to the corrupt businesses run by the Taiwanese. However, the three powers of opium, gambling, and prostitution in the local area are completely in the hands of the Taiwanese, and it is expected that the prospect of banning them is still difficult. Many Chinese who run opium businesses use Taiwanese signs, even buying Taiwanese nationality with money as a protective charm for their business. There are no cases of false nationality in brothels, but the flower tax levied is too heavy. Prostitutes have to pay two yuan in flower tax for a ticket, but their income is only five yuan. Taiwanese brothels do not pay any taxes, so Chinese prostitutes cannot survive in Xiamen. After Xiamen was established as a city, Mayor Wang Guipan took office on the 1st of this month and plans to make a lot of efforts to reorganize the city. In the future, direct negotiations may be convenient, and it will not be necessary to transfer matters to the provincial government for resolution as before. (Special dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>— Hua</p>
<p>There is a Western proverb that says, "Knowledge is power." This saying is indeed true. In terms of an individual, a person lacking knowledge cannot undertake important tasks because of insufficient ability. Extending this to the entire society and nation, if scholars do not enjoy learning and the majority of the people are ignorant, then society will inevitably become numb and apathetic, and the national spirit will inevitably wither and decline. It would be difficult to expect it to be strong and powerful. An ancient person said, "Lack of soldiers is not a cause for deep concern; lack of provisions is not a cause for bitter weeping. The only thing to be concerned about is looking at this world and seeking someone who rushes to seize profits without first fulfilling his duty, and who fears being behind in loyalty and righteousness. Such a person is not readily found. This is something to lament greatly." Our country is in a dangerous international environment today. Dare we rephrase it? The oppression of foreign aggression is not a cause for deep fear; the impact of the economic panic and the tide of chaos is not a cause for deep concern. Only the weakness of the intelligence of our entire nation is insufficient to cope with the various difficult and complex internal and external problems, making my society and country embark on a bright way out, which is truly regrettable. Reading is a way to increase knowledge. If we want to remedy the problem of insufficient general intelligence in our country, we cannot but hope that students will read more, and that all literate people will also read more, using reading as a method to achieve the purpose of increasing knowledge. Now, for the purpose of enriching the national intelligence, the China Cultural Construction Association has launched a national reading movement and is holding a national reading competition, setting up registration offices in the provincial and municipal branches of the Cultural Construction Association (the details of which are detailed in the education news of this newspaper on March 26). It stipulates that the first reading period is from April 1 to the end of September. The association also prepares a bonus of 3,000 yuan to reward those who achieve excellent results in order to encourage them. This kind of movement and method really meets the needs of China today. "Starting is simple, finishing is huge." We deeply hope that it can produce great effects in the future.</p>
<p>The Reading Competition, in its first reading period, corrects the shortcomings of today's school system in a negative way, and cultivates a national atmosphere of love of learning in a positive way. We dare to believe that it should be helpful. However, there are many illiterate people in our country and very few good popular readings. In addition, relatively complete libraries are limited to a few large cities. If we want the effectiveness of the Reading Competition to increase and the practical effect of the reading movement to be universal throughout the country in the future, then the advancement of illiteracy eradication, the compilation of popular readings, and the expansion and addition of libraries must be carried out simultaneously. We secretly hope that the people of the country will also pay attention to and work hard on this.</p>
<p>At present, students and those who can participate in the Reading Competition are fortunate in terms of the comparison of the level of knowledge with the general illiterate. Therefore, we hope that on the one hand, we will read more books, and on the other hand, we will observe and study our entire society as a book. Do not adhere to the old and conservative, do not blindly follow suit, understand the real needs of today's society and country, and work hard. When research is successful, further uphold the principle of "establishing oneself and establishing others," and do our best to provide assistance to those with a lower level of knowledge. This is also our hope for students across the country and all those participating in the competition.</p>

<p>Gaberville Hill: Chinese Ambassador to the United States Shi Zhaoji said in a speech here today that the US silver purchase policy is causing substantial damage to China. Shi also stated that China has always supported US President Roosevelt's "good neighbor" policy. Although there are various disputes between China and Japan, China also hopes to apply this policy to Japan. Shi solemnly declared that all harmonious neighbors must understand the principle of equality, respect the rights and interests of others, and thoroughly understand the needs of others. People in the US Congress who believe that the silver purchase policy is beneficial to China are an example of not understanding the situation of their neighbors, because this policy is actually harmful and not beneficial to China. The American people have no intention of harming the Chinese people, and the reason for this is that they cannot understand it. The United States has always expressed goodwill towards China and declared that the cultures of the two countries are fundamentally compatible, so there is a union of knowledge and emotion between China and the United States.

<h3 id="e63">Congress Passes US President's Public Works Relief Bill Dedicated to Relieving Unemployed People Intense Debate During Discussion <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Congress today passed President Roosevelt's $4.88 billion public works relief bill. The government has also immediately planned to create jobs for 3.5 million unemployed people. There was intense and lengthy debate when the two houses finally passed the bill. The president even lost control of the Senate Democrats three times. However, the power granted to the president by the bill was greater than his original proposal. The president is now free to dispose of a portion of the funds for agricultural adjustment purposes. In this way, if the government deems it appropriate, all business taxes can be abolished. $880 million of the funds will be controlled by Federal Relief Bureau Director Hopkins and will still be used for direct relief to unemployed people. However, the president hopes that after the government employs a large number of people, the need for direct relief can be gradually reduced. The large amount of funds allocated by the bill is unprecedented in the United States in peacetime, and the president has the power to dispose of it freely. It is said that the president was very pleased to hear that the bill had passed. He has repeatedly said that if 5 million unemployed people in the United States regain their jobs, the US depression can be eliminated. Now that the bill has been passed, according to the methods it stipulates, the government must find a way to use at least one-third of the funds as wages, and there are no other restrictions. The various amendments proposed by the two houses during the discussion were not passed. (6th National Telegram)</p>

<p>(Washington) The House of Representatives today passed a bill increasing the total number of military personnel serving in the United States during wartime to 23 million. This bill is an amendment to the McSwain War Profits Cancellation Act. There was almost no opposition when it was voted on. Its content is to change the originally stipulated military service age from 21 to 31 years old to 21 to 45 years old. In addition, McSwain's proposal also has four amendments that have been passed as follows: (1) All "excessive" profits during wartime must be fully paid as national taxes. (2) Authorize the government to confiscate all domestic resources. (3) Guarantee that army and navy personnel receive wages equal to the minimum wage of unskilled workers. (4) Prohibit American soldiers from fighting in foreign countries. In the future, the American army can only defend American territory. (6th National Telegram)</p>

<p>(Paris) Foreign Ministry officials have drafted a memorandum and a draft resolution, which will be submitted to the government on Tuesday and forwarded to the Extraordinary Session of the Council of the League of Nations (scheduled to be held on the 15th of this month). This memorandum was typed, and the full text is about ten pages. Its content is to reiterate the protest made by the French government on March 20 due to Germany's resumption of conscription, and to state the intention of the Anglo-French London Declaration of February 3, which was originally intended to allow Germany to return to the scope of international rule of law, and British Foreign Secretary Simon has also decided to make suggestions that are both friendly to Germany and facilitate the , but the German government blatantly ignored it and resumed compulsory military service just as Foreign Secretary Simon was about to set off, causing unrest throughout the world. The responsibility should be borne by Germany. Therefore, the French government resolutely requests the Council of the League of Nations to condemn Germany's unilateral actions in violating the current treaty in spirit. The full text of the draft resolution is two pages, which is a suggestion to the Council of the League of Nations on sanction measures, some of which are said to be of an active nature. What should be noted at this time is that this kind of document has no definite form so far, and the State Council may revise it, especially the draft resolution, or the Stresa Conference may revise it, and it is rumored to become a joint plan of the three countries of Britain, France and Italy. It is generally believed that Foreign Minister Laval will set off for Russia on April 23, arrive in Moscow on the 25th, stay for three days, then go to Warsaw, and return home at the beginning of next month.

<p>Key Points of Eden's Report</p>
<p>(London) The Observer's diplomatic correspondent said today that he heard that the key points of the report that the Lord Privy Seal Eden intends to submit to the cabinet tomorrow are that Russia, Poland, France and the Little Entente are all prepared to accept the proposal for a collective security system based on military mutual assistance. It is now believed that Italy will also participate in it. Germany has rejected the Eastern European Convention and the Danube Convention in their current form, saying that it is willing to expand the principle of bilateral non-aggression pacts into multilateral pacts, but its obligations are limited to assuming that it will not assist aggressor countries. The opinions expressed by the capitals after British Foreign Secretary Simon's visit to Berlin are that Germany's contribution to European peace is even less than that of the League of Nations Covenant. The British government must now decide on the second step it will take in Europe, that is, whether to seek negotiations on a universal security system, or to allow Europe to conclude regional pacts and alliances on its own.

<p>Poland Opposes Solutions</p>
<p>(London) According to the Foreign Communications published in the Daily Telegraph, the conclusion of Eden's visit to Moscow is that although the international situation is very unsatisfactory, the danger of armed conflict is not as serious as generally suspected. The reporter of the Daily Telegraph also said that according to Eden's understanding, he deeply feels that there is still room for resolving the opposition group's guarantee in Poland, and according to the impression he gained in Berlin, Germany may not permanently insist on its current position. The countries visited by Eden have no aggressive intentions. On the contrary, they are praying for peace very earnestly. However, Britain must help Europe achieve its peace. The reporter also predicted that Italy and France will each have certain proposals to be submitted at the Stresa Conference, and Mussolini will also request a clearer explanation of Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant. Under the terms of that article, member states are responsible for military judgment against aggressor countries when necessary, and should at least have the power of economic judgment. In addition, the Rome correspondent of the London Daily Telegraph also stated that Mussolini will suggest canceling the restrictions on the military clauses of the peace treaties related to Austria, Bulgaria and Hungary, so that they can reorganize their armaments to "offset the disaster of Germany."</p>

The agreement was drafted yesterday by French Minister of Commerce Marchandeau and Belgian Prime Minister Chierante in Brusel. (6th National Telegram) The Franco-Belgian trade agreement in Brussels was approved by the Belgian Cabinet today. (6th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The main contents of the trade agreement established yesterday between France and the Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union are as follows: The governments of Belgium and Luxembourg, in view of the fact that Belgian goods may flood into the French market after the devaluation of currency, and that their low prices are sufficient to disrupt the French economy, have decided to take various beneficial measures to prevent this. This decision has been filed by the French government. The governments of France and Belgium have decided on the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Groups composed of producers of certain goods on both sides have reached an understanding, and this understanding has been recognized by both governments. They should be ordered to compromise with each other and take necessary restrictive measures. If these groups cannot reach a compromise, the governments of both sides should take necessary measures.</p>
<p>(2) For goods imported into France that are subject to quota restrictions, the seller should declare in writing that the price sold should not be lower than the usual price (the so-called usual price is the price before the devaluation of the Belgian currency), and then the French government will issue an import license. Violators will be prohibited from importing for a period of one year.</p>
<p>(3) For other goods, when necessary, the governments of Belgium and Luxembourg will be responsible for establishing a license system and conducting audits to ensure that the price of these goods imported into France is not lower than the usual price due to the devaluation of the Belgian currency.</p>
<p>(4) France and the Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union should immediately hold commercial negotiations based on this concrete approach.</p>
<p>(5) The term of validity of the above agreement is limited to six months. The two governments can adjust the prices of goods on their own. If they are satisfied, they can announce the termination before the expiration date. (6th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the devaluation of the Belgian currency, the prices of goods from this country calculated in French francs have become cheaper than before. Therefore, the French market has a place for Belgian goods to be dumped. In order to prevent this, the commercial authorities of France and Belgium signed a compromise this afternoon after very friendly negotiations. According to this agreement, Belgian goods imported into a certain country should not be lower in price than when the Belgian currency was not devalued without sufficient reason, and the amount of French goods imported into Belgium should not be reduced compared to before. In the future, Belgian goods imported into France will be priced in French francs. (6th Reuters</p>
<p>Dutch Currency Stable</p>
<p>Hague: Semi-official sources believe that there is no need to worry about the future of the Dutch currency. The speculator's short selling movement has now stopped. The National Bank's discount rate, which was previously increased from 2.5% to 3.5% on Thursday, has taken effect and is sufficient to prevent cash from flowing abroad. The government and the National Bank authorities have decided to maintain the current monetary policy and will use all means to prevent the Dutch currency from falling. It is generally believed that the impact of the Belgian currency devaluation has reached its peak and there is no risk of contagion. The Dutch currency will still follow the French franc, in other words, maintain the gold standard. (6th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Sufficient Gold Reserves</p>
<p>The Hague, capital of the Netherlands: The Dutch Telegraph Agency said that after the National Bank increased the discount rate from 2.5% to 3.5% on Thursday, it was originally scheduled to increase it again yesterday. The proposal was abandoned because most of the cash flowing out of the country had stopped. However, if speculators continue to attack the Dutch currency, the discount rate may still be increased. Although cash is still being continuously shipped to the United States at this time, financial figures believe that the future of the Dutch currency will not change. Even if speculators continue to manipulate it, the Netherlands will still maintain the current parity. The cash reserves of Dutch banks are very large, and the monetary position is still extremely strong compared to Belgium. (6th Havas Telegram)</p>

Goebbels also quoted the words of the great German philosopher Nietzsche, namely, "Living dangerously," saying that Germany already has the courage to put these words into practice. He also said that National Socialist Germany has already withdrawn from the League of Nations and, in a year and a half, has rebuilt its defeated army, because it has obtained justice, for might makes right.

<p>(Moscow) The famous Soviet political commentator Radek has an article, "After a British Cabinet Member's Visit," published in Izvestia. Radek first quoted a dispatch from the London Times correspondent in Berlin, saying that Hitler will never convince British politicians that the Soviet Union poses any threat to Germany. Radek further stated that German diplomatic circles once regarded Simon and Eden as mediators between Germany and France, and that Germany could use them to make France realize that France has nothing to fear from Germany. Radek then quoted an article from the March 30th issue of the Journal de Genève to prove that the intensification of military preparations in East Prussia is merely a disguise, and that the actual goal of German policy is France and its allies. Radek further pointed out that all of Germany's demands regarding increasing its army, navy, and air force are primarily aimed at the Western powers. Regarding Germany's opposition to Eastern European treaties, what it opposes is not only the Soviet Union, but also Poland. Radek continued, "The British Cabinet members will report their observations to the government, and the inferences they make will certainly not be detrimental to the Soviet Union. At the same time, they must ease the impressions of Berlin and Moscow so that the door for negotiations between the countries will not be closed. However, the current issue is not to establish the situation that already exists, but to establish the situation that must be established. Therefore, the main issue at present should be as follows: Germany cannot satisfy its demands after a war of fire. Today, Germany is again relying on its military power to make its demands. Currently, from a military point of view, Germany's economic resources are very limited and are still weaker compared to countries willing to maintain peace. However, today's Europe is clearly standing at a crossroads. If some individuals are given freedom, then the situation will develop towards military alliances and war. The second path is to reconsider and try to establish new relations of power in Europe after considering the existing changes. The European powers are now facing a problem, namely, reorganizing the League of Nations to make it consistent with the new relations of power. At the same time, if we wish to avoid a future world war, the League of Nations can settle some issues in an amicable manner so that they can be left unresolved. Is this method possible?" Radek reiterated the suggestion of strengthening Articles 10 and 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, saying that these articles had no power before the Manchurian Incident, so all those who cherish peace will certainly not oppose their revision. "However, we must remember that in the past, countries also wanted to accomplish this by specifying the general provisions of the Covenant. The League of Nations accepted the so-called Geneva Protocol proposed by France, but the British government did not ratify it because the constraints it listed were too strict. Conversely, the British government put forward its Western Regional Pact based on a concept, namely, that the major powers are more likely to accept certain definite obligations for certain definite issues, while these obligations do not bind the whole world, but bind a specific region. This pact was solemnly pointed out in the Anglo-French proposals of February 3, its Western Sky Pact, which stipulates that any Western European country that encounters an attack must immediately provide sky-based assistance. The Eastern European Mutual Assistance Regional Pact proposed by France and the Soviet Union is based on the belief that obligations that are accurately defined for certain specific and complex issues must be easier to accept than obligations to the entire world. Although we have encountered opposition from Germany and Poland, we are convinced that this viewpoint is not wrong. We believe that we must not lose heart in the face of difficulties. On the contrary, we will fight to overcome the difficulties. We must specifically consider where the danger zones that threaten peace are, which regional pacts are necessary, and at the same time, how to link them into an organization and insert them into the League of Nations Covenant. When the major powers consider the issue of defining the meaning of the League of Nations Covenant, they must also study other issues that are more concerning to other countries, especially the meaning of Article 19 of the Covenant (regarding the amendment of treaties that have become invalid and threaten war). "The Soviet Union will take a favorable attitude towards the presentation of all issues that can strengthen peace. However, such issues may not be decided by the three countries meeting in Stresa, because they require the cooperation and exchange of views of all relevant countries. We must demand that the Stresa Conference not add obstacles to the path of universal decisions. On the contrary, it must promote this work. The main task of the conference is to confirm that the situation studied by the British Cabinet members does not require the cancellation of the Anglo-French proposals of February 3, but is a resolute struggle to strive for their realization. In the current situation, if anyone believes that the problem of solving universal security can be achieved by concluding a sky mutual assistance pact in the West with Westerners, and the rest will be "continued efforts" (this is diplomatic language), then this decision will be detrimental to universal security. At the same time, a new situation will arise in European countries. It is not enough for us to only ask the Stresa Conference not to do harm. We must also demand that the representatives of the three major countries, with a calm and resolute attitude, convey the intentions of their respective governments to create a collective security organization. In this effort, they must consider the vigorous cooperation of the Soviet Union, which is as concerned as the other countries in maintaining peace, and which is less concerned than other countries about the work of isolating or discriminating against a certain country," he said.

The mutual friction between the two sides is becoming more and more intense. The People's Action Party is especially harsh in its attacks on President Zamora, saying that the exclusion of the party was done by Zamora, and announced that as soon as the parliament reconvenes on May 6, it will overthrow the government. The Lerroux cabinet is of a caretaker nature. Now, in order to extend its life and not let it collapse in a few days, it is doing everything possible to win over other parties so that when the parliament reconvenes, after the current cabinet is overthrown, it can reorganize a new cabinet on a broader basis.

<p>New Delhi: The Indian Legislative Assembly, ignoring the Governor-General's serious warning, today rejected the government's financial bill by a vote of 64 to 41. The Governor-General had previously stated that if the amendments unfavorable to the government proposed by the Legislative Assembly were passed, the government's revenue would be reduced by 3.75 million pounds. The Financial Secretary of the Indian government, Grigg, stated today that some of the amendments proposed by the Legislative Assembly are absolutely impossible to implement. The National Congress Party intends to implement its policy of forcing the government to exercise its emergency powers. If the opposition party is prepared to cooperate to seek the welfare of the people, the authorities are willing to consider its opinions as much as possible within the scope of possibility. As a result of the Legislative Assembly's rejection of the financial bill, it will be certified by the Governor-General and submitted to the meeting of the Executive Council on April 9. It is expected that the bill will be passed by the Executive Council at that time. (Sixth Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government has decided to start organizing a Cabinet Deliberation Council and a Cabinet Investigation Bureau. Prime Minister Okada and the three elders, Takahashi, Tokonami, and Machida, have agreed on the basic principles, and the two ministers, Tokonami and Machida, have decided to earnestly request Finance Minister Takahashi to serve as the vice chairman of the Deliberation Council. However, the president and former Seiyukai factions of the Seiyukai have expressed their opposition, so major obstacles may occur. Although the government hopes for Taro Yamamoto and Chikuhira Nakajima of the Seiyukai, it is still questionable whether they can sacrifice their future political positions and respond to the government's request. However, if the Seiyukai does not participate, it will be difficult to meet the needs of national unity, so the government will run around to smooth relations in the future, and at the same time, it will earnestly request the assistance of Seiyukai President Suzuki to achieve national unity. However, whether the Seiyukai can accommodate or not is quite doubtful. (Seventh Denchu Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e93">German Air Force Expansion <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— (German Dispatch)</p>
<p>Although Germany is restricted by the Treaty of Versailles, it is determined not to lag behind in the clamor for military expansion, especially in the armament of its air force. Even those who have been stationed here for a long time do not quite know how many airplanes Germany actually has. Conservative British leader Baldwin estimates there are between six hundred and one thousand. The French Minister of Aviation estimates there are one thousand one hundred. Ernst Henri, the author of "Will Hitler Conquer Europe?", says it has one thousand two hundred to one thousand five hundred. He also says that the current production capacity of all German aircraft factories, when fully mobilized, can produce two thousand airplanes per month. Although Germany is restricted by the treaty and cannot freely expand its air defense, it has devised another method, which is to develop civil aviation. Civil aviation is controlled by the Ministry of Aviation. For example, the overnight express train between Berlin and East Prussia has been discontinued since last year and replaced by air travel. Last year alone, the total distance of airline routes was six million miles, carrying one hundred thousand passengers and one million kilograms of cargo. The length of its routes is almost equal to the combined length of the airline routes of England, Italy, and the Netherlands. Under the command of German Aviation Minister Göring, there are now two large aircraft manufacturing factories, namely "Junkers" and "Dornier." They are currently building excellent commercial passenger aircraft, but with a quick turnaround, they can be converted into military aircraft, which has already been tested. The new "D-2000" model aircraft manufactured by "Dornier" can carry a load of five thousand kilograms, with a speed of two hundred and fifty kilometers per hour and a range of one thousand kilometers. For example, the "G-3 Hindenburg Marshal" also has the same payload characteristics, but it is also equipped with two twenty-millimeter cannons, a command tower, and several machine guns. This is truly an airborne flying warship.</p>
<p>If these types of aircraft are formed into a squadron, using two hundred to two hundred and fifty to form a team to fly from Hamburg to London, then the bombs dropped in one go could be equal to all the bombs dropped on London by German aircraft during the European War—eight hundred tons. And the losses suffered, if flying at night, the opposing anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns would lose their effectiveness, and their own losses would be at most a sacrifice of 15%.</p>
<p>We also know that the reason why it is not easy to expand the air force is not only in the manufacture of aircraft, but also, more importantly, in the training of pilots who can fly and accurately drop bombs. Germany currently has more than two thousand five hundred well-trained pilots. Due to the expansion of its domestic aviation network, they are familiar with the conditions in the skies above their country, its borders, and even other countries, as well as the geographical features, climate changes, and so on. In times of war, they can immediately become excellent pilots. According to Göring's plan, he will organize an airborne assault force of three hundred thousand people in the future. The first step of his aviation policy is to vigorously promote the necessity of air defense, so that the general public understands the great significance of air defense, and further arouse the public's interest in flying, and promote the aviation craze among young people. Ordinary aviation techniques are taught in all secondary schools, and the skill of piloting an airplane is transformed into a game. This policy has had considerable effect so far, and the students' enthusiasm for flying has indeed been aroused by his policy. Now they all want to engage in flying.</p>
<p>Göring's policy is not only for male students, but also extends to the women's community recently, so an women's department has been newly established in aviation schools, teaching them specialized knowledge of air defense. They are also taught about the effects of poisonous gas and the methods of detoxification and disinfection. In addition, there are various tasks, such as minimizing the spread of fire caused by incendiary bombs, temporary special treatment for the injured and poisoned, bandaging methods, and temporary rapid construction of shelters. Even the work of specialized scientists and carpenters must be learned by women. Currently, under the education department of the Air Defense Association, eight hundred women's associations have learned various air defense methods. This alone shows Germany's efforts in air defense and air force armament are fully loaded, which is truly unprecedented by others. Even on the locomotive hood, people sometimes climb and sit, and the co-driver stands on the footplate, letting one seat carry two passengers. The car is overloaded, which leads to dangers along the way, so the railway bureau should find ways to restrict it. If it can plan as a whole and organize strictly, and take all vehicles completely into public ownership, it will be more secure in terms of traffic safety.</p>
<p>After the snow, the reporter set off from Lanzhou. The weather was very sunny. The car started from the Grand Hotel outside the South Gate. Just as it was about to leave Dongshaomen, military police checked the luggage. Seeing a coffin placed under the car, transported from Xinjiang, they suspected it contained musk or valuables, but it was not convenient to open it for inspection. After a long time of investigation, they finally let it go. Among the crowd gathered nearby, a water carrier accidentally placed a cigarette butt in his pocket. His cotton-padded jacket was burned, and he screamed in pain. The gaze of the crowd's inspection was immediately focused on him. Seeing him hurriedly take off his jacket, smoke came out from the collar, and everyone couldn't help but laugh. A bucket of Yellow River water was placed nearby, and a thin layer of ice had just formed on the surface of the water. From this, one can see the coldness of spring in Lanzhou and prove the time-consuming nature of the inspection. There were also five special cargo trucks traveling with us. Each truck was carrying three soldiers and one or two freight merchants with yellow silk strips on their chests. The trucks had small flags of the Gansu Province Anti-Smoking Committee inserted on the front. They all passed us (the inspection point), not only without stopping, but also speeding away first. What exactly was loaded in the trucks? The inspectors probably knew at a glance.</p>
<p>The car left Lanzhou's Dongshaomen and traveled about seven or eight miles. The wind and dust were flying, making it difficult to breathe. The city tower with the atmosphere of an ancient capital and the beautifully scenic Five Springs Mountain were successively obscured and could not be looked back upon. There were barracks on the left side of the road, as large as a square city, with four gates opened facing south. Each gate had a screen wall in front of it, arranged in a straight line from east to west. Each wall had slogans written on it. Reading from east to west, they said "Revive the Chinese Nation," "Rectify Combat Readiness Actions," "Consolidate Northwest National Defense," "Recover the Lost Territories of the Northeast." The characters were in large fonts and clearly visible from a distance, with forceful tones. But what about implementing them? Twelve or thirteen miles to Donggang Slope, yellow slopes lined the road, winding slowly. Five miles to Yama's Ravine, the cliffs stood tall on the right, and the wells were deep and sunken on the left. The road was extremely narrow and dangerous, and robberies often occurred in the past. The cliffs were artificially cut, with green stones and yellow earth layered alternately, neatly and beautifully. The ravine was divided into three branches, and one of them was filled in, 120 meters high, which took more than 60,000 labor days and cost more than 10,000 silver dollars. When the car traveled here, it suddenly stopped. After a brief conversation with Mr. Someone from the Engineering Office, it was said that the construction of this ravine was done by a specially hired foreign engineer, otherwise there would be no such achievement. It was also said that the engineer's name was so-and-so, and that he was very friendly with him, and his words were quite complacent. Twenty miles to Zhujiazuizi (commonly known as Pig's Mouth), the mountains stretched far to the left, and the land was flat. Crossing the Majiasi River, the river water was frozen along the road, smooth and crystal clear, like crossing a jade bridge. Seventy miles to Gancaodian, there were more than four hundred households of residents, with earthen houses laid out flat, patches of residual snow, and several old trees, on which migratory birds with shrunken necks perched. The courtyards of the villages passed by were square and walled, with ancient moss and black spots on the northwest sides, while those facing southeast had no moss traces. Military science uses moss traces to identify directions, which can be said to be practical and based on evidence. After this, the journey became winding. The Baoweizhan's car ascended the first ridge, with high cliffs and deep valleys, allowing only one road to pass. In the past, the Ming general Xu Da defeated the Yuan bandit Wang Baobao at Chedao, which was located here. The terraced wheat fields on the mountain, along with the half-dissolved snow, contrasted the dark yin and the bright yang, creating an interesting scene. The farmers lived in caves dug out of the cliffs near their cultivated land, so there were no villages. Going downhill and crossing the stream, it was already night. There were very high ice ridges, and the car could not go up. Everyone got out of the car to pull it, but unexpectedly, bags and cushions fell into the water one after another. Everyone rolled up their sleeves and entered the water, stirring the ice and retrieving them, all exhaling and shivering. The reporter lost a map, which someone conveniently picked up, but it was covered in mud and sand and could no longer be used. Later, they traveled another thirty or forty miles at night and arrived at Dingxi City to stay. From Lanzhou to here, the distance was two hundred and forty miles, and the actual measurement was more than 113 kilometers. The hotel room had a round top and a square bottom, just like a kiln bridge, no different from living in a cave, called a cave dwelling. The walls and top were made of earth, cool in summer and warm in winter, but the light and air were quite lacking. Mr. Someone in the same car talked by the stove after dinner, discussing the lack of teachers in Lanzhou schools as follows:</p>
<p>There are many schools in Lanzhou, but the lack of teachers is particularly noticeable. Elementary schools are still flawless, but in secondary schools and above, the higher the grade, the more obvious the shortcomings. Gansu College, the highest institution of higher learning in Gansu Province, sometimes has more faculty members than students, but in terms of quality, it is absolutely impossible to compliment them. Moreover, one person teaches in four or five schools, with up to forty points of assigned classes per week, exceeding the number of class hours for students. Therefore, they often have to ask for leave or be absent from classes in rotation from various schools. Graduates who transfer to national universities as transfer students often have more than enough qualifications but insufficient level. Students from other counties who come to the province to take the entrance examination mostly take the entrance examination for the First High School first, followed by the First Normal School and the Fifth High School. If all three schools fail, they transfer to Gansu College with fake diplomas, and many are lucky enough to be admitted. The college fees are more than 90,000 yuan per year, and there is no lack of criticism in society. If the education authorities really want to strengthen rectification, they must break away from favoritism and eliminate the outdated, otherwise it will be difficult to achieve results.</p>

<p>Nanchang dispatch: The Jiangxi Red bandits have been eliminated through five encirclements and suppressions by the central government with all its strength. It has been eight years since then. The number of fallen soldiers and murdered civilians is unknown. The Jiangxi Provincial People's Association and other groups initiated a large-scale memorial service, which was prepared for three months and held on the Qingming Festival. Representatives from various central agencies, provinces, counties, and cities participated in the memorial service. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The memorial service was held at the newly completed Lishi Society. The society building, towering on the banks of the river, had colorful flower cloth arches erected on the main road in front, east and west. The passageway between the two arches was covered with elegiac couplets from various provincial, city, and county agencies and organizations. From a distance, it was a white expanse. At the entrance, there were three colorful arches, all with a solemn atmosphere. The auditorium was in the society's grand hall. Above it was the spirit tablet of the soldiers who died in the suppression of bandits in Jiangxi and the loyal martyrs who were martyred. In front was the main sacrificial platform, filled with incense, flowers, fruits, and offerings. Below were the seats for representatives from all walks of life, and the surrounding area was covered with eulogies and wreaths, which were extremely brilliant. On that day, the attendees included Cheng Tianfang from the Central Party Department, Gu Zhutong representing the Military Commission, Xue Yuesui representing the Executive Yuan, Xu Chonghao from the Examination Yuan, Lu Shizeng from the Judicial Yuan, Zheng Luosheng from the Control Yuan, Tu Weifan and other representatives from the military, naval, financial, and educational departments, Lin, Cheng Tianfang, Xu Shi, and other representatives from the provinces of Suiyuan, Jiangsu, Gansu, Fujian, Anhui, Shaanxi, Henan, Zhejiang, Shandong, Guangdong, various military divisions, and representatives from organizations and groups, totaling more than two thousand people. The participants all wore black gauze armbands. The ceremony was conducted by all in blue robes and black jackets, with the Central Party Department and ten other agencies forming the main sacrificial group.</p>
<p>At about 8:00 AM, the solemn and solemn opening ceremony began. Amidst the rumbling of cannons, mourning music was played, the flag was lowered to half-mast, and the rituals were performed. Chairman Yu Baiqing reported the significance of the meeting, stating that today is a day for the nation to sweep the tombs and commemorate the soldiers who died in the suppression of bandits and the loyal martyrs who were martyred, which is also a sacrifice for the revival of the nation, with great significance. He hoped that everyone would continue to work hard, sweep away the remaining bandits, and complete the work of revival. Next, the public memorial was held. Representatives from the Central Party Department, the National Government, the Military Commission, and other agencies offered sacrifices in turn, with the following rituals: (1) The chief officiant takes his place; (2) The participants take their places; (3) Mourning music is played; (4) Three bows are performed; (5) Wreaths are presented; (6) Libations are offered; (7) Fruits are offered; (8) The chief officiant retires; (9) The ceremony ends. From 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM, the Party, government, military, and police agencies held public sacrifices. From 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM, business and academic circles paid tribute. From 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM, mass organizations paid tribute.</p>
<p>There were no less than ten thousand elegiac couplets and eulogies from various places. The Central Party Department inscribed "Great Martyrs' Eternal Glory." Chairman Lin inscribed "Unyielding Heroic Spirits." Chairman Chiang's elegiac couplet read, "Pity the worms and sands in the dust, relying on your sacrifice for righteousness, jointly support justice, drum up thoughts for the soldiers, and see the remaining bandits about to be annihilated, enough to comfort the heroic spirits." President Wang's elegiac couplet read, "Stars and beautiful mountains leave their remaining brilliance, and wind and rain, the spiritual flag endows great recruitment." Zhang Xueliang's elegiac couplet read, "Peng Bo's clear report of virtue, Kuang Lu's fragrant atmosphere endows the call of souls." The rest are omitted.</p>
<p>It has been eight years since the suppression of the Red bandits in Jiangxi. The losses of the central government and local areas are no less than hundreds of millions. The division commanders who died include Hu Zuyu of the Fifth Division, Zhang Huizuan of the Eighteenth Division, Li Ming of the Fifty-second Division, and Guo Bingsheng of the New Thirty-sixth Division. There are also quite a few brigade and regimental commanders. Permanent monuments will be built to commemorate them forever. (April 6)</p>

<h3 id="e96">Northwest Inspection Report <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— By Our Special Correspondent, Geng Ya</p>
<p>On the Road Through Gansu and Shaanxi</p>
<p>The Xi'an-Lanzhou highway is still under construction, but commercial vehicles have been transporting goods and passengers between the two cities for years. This route is a vital transportation artery connecting Qin (Shaanxi) and Long (Gansu), impacting the prosperity of commerce in the Northwest. In the past, relay horse transportation was used, with eighteen horse stations. Now, by car, the journey takes five to six days. Once the entire line is completed, it is expected to be reduced to three to four days. However, currently, most of the vehicles operate as both passenger and freight carriers. There are as many as eighty or ninety car companies operating on the northern route. However, each company owns only one to three vehicles. The companies compete fiercely, arbitrarily lowering prices to attract customers. According to the Transportation Committee's designated price for the entire line, it should be over fifty yuan per passenger, but the actual ticket prices vary greatly. From Xi'an to Lanzhou, with congested freight, each ticket still sells for twenty-seven or twenty-eight yuan. From Lanzhou to Xi'an, with less freight, the ticket prices are even lower, sometimes selling for only fourteen or fifteen yuan. While this is economical for passengers, the passenger and freight</p>

<p>provinces and municipal governments, 1. To comply with, now recording the orders of the Office of the Commander-in-Chief and the measures to prohibit opium and narcotics as follows:</p>
<p>Orders from the Office of the Commander-in-Chief: Upon investigation, the anti-opium affairs in the ten provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Shaanxi, and Gansu were entrusted to the Military Affairs Commission for handling in July of last year, according to the National Government's Order No. 480. Regarding the prohibition of opium and narcotics, the Commission referred to the effective measures for investigating and prohibiting opium and narcotics that were piloted by the General Headquarters of the Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces in the bandit suppression areas. Rules and regulations were formulated, strengthened, and enforced with military law, which has become increasingly effective since its implementation. In the provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangsu, even in remote areas, opium seedlings are rarely found. Furthermore, in the Jiangsu Province, the registration of opium addicts, which was organized by the provincial government last year, has achieved remarkable results in just a few months of management of smoking and sales. A provisional ordinance strictly prohibiting highly addictive drugs was also promulgated and implemented in provinces such as Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, and cities such as Peiping and Tianjin, and its strict enforcement has had a significant impact, rescuing people from misery and gaining international sympathy. However, in the past, the scourge of drugs and opium spread too widely. Now, to thoroughly eliminate and ban them as scheduled, it is necessary to take a further step, strictly defining the procedures so that the inland and remote provinces can advance simultaneously and equally. Otherwise, if the root source is not blocked, and efforts are relaxed in one area while strengthened in another, it will greatly hinder the future of the anti-opium policy. Therefore, two implementation measures for the prohibition of narcotics and opium have been re-promulgated, adding to the various effective regulations that have already been issued, and strengthening cooperation with all sectors of society to jointly combat drugs and opium. For highly addictive drugs, it is stipulated that there will be a two-year deadline from the year 24 to the end of the year 25 to completely eliminate them. In the first year, severe criminal penalties will be imposed, and after the deadline, from the year 26 onwards, all offenders will be sentenced to death without leniency. As for the cunning criminals who manufacture and traffic drugs, they will be executed at any time. Even those who assist the criminals will be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment according to the standards of each year, without any exceptions. The aim is to achieve the effect of eradicating evil within the shortest possible time. Regarding the prohibition of opium, a six-year deadline is set, from the year 24 to the end of the year 29. For the prohibition of cultivation, it is stipulated that each province must conduct a general inspection of opium seedlings once a year during the period when they emerge from the soil. At that time, the Commission will also send special commissioners to the provinces to supervise the inspections, to ensure that there is no resurgence in the inland provinces where cultivation is absolutely prohibited, and that the standards for annual reduction in cultivation are practical in the remote provinces. Regarding the trafficking, sale, and consumption of opium, in addition to strictly controlling and managing them in accordance with the existing anti-opium regulations, more detailed measures for mutual association and deduction, which are reduced annually, are also stipulated to ensure that there is no room for embellishment or pretext. At the same time, the performance of local officials in enforcing the prohibition of narcotics and opium will be evaluated as a basis for rewards and punishments. Furthermore, local self-governance and self-defense organizations, as well as Party, government, military, schools, factories, and other institutions, will be tasked with promoting the prohibition of narcotics and opium to awaken the public. From the Office of the Commander-in-Chief to the provinces, cities, and counties, fair and dedicated individuals will be recruited to form anti-opium committees at all levels to jointly assist in the prohibition of narcotics and the cessation of opium, to ensure that officials are cautious and society follows suit, to encourage each other and work together to achieve success. It must be understood that the prohibition of narcotics and opium is vital to the nation and the people, and is related to the rise and fall of our entire nation. No matter what difficulties or obstacles there may be, we must do our utmost to eradicate them in order to achieve the goal of a two-year prohibition of narcotics and a six-year prohibition of opium. If this method is followed, and all provinces work together, the entire nation will join forces, and there is no reason why it cannot be achieved. It is hoped that the governors and mayors of each province will understand this intention, lead their subordinates, and strictly follow the procedures stipulated in these two measures. If there are still those who outwardly comply but inwardly defy, or who are perfunctory and neglect their duties, they will be severely punished for the crime of dereliction of duty and harming the people, once the facts are verified through random inspections. In addition to reporting to the National Government for record-keeping and issuing separate orders, the two implementation measures for the prohibition of narcotics and opium are urgently sent to the provincial and municipal governments for compliance, and the progress of compliance should be reported at any time. This order is issued.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Anhui Province Work Relief Begins—Dredging Rivers and Building Roads Simultaneously <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The two projects of dredging lakes and rivers and building roads in Anhui Province have begun to be implemented at the end of last month. In addition to the project funds that have been allocated by the Department of Finance, the relief grain has been distributed by Wuhu Grain a few days ago in accordance with the number, so various urgent projects are being actively carried out. Now, Pei Yixiang, Director of the Provincial Water Conservancy Project Office, has been awarded the regulations of Article 3 of the Work Relief Method, and the work relief is calculated according to the cubic foot, and 2 liters of grain are given for each cubic foot. However, the amount of relief grain is limited, and those who need both grain and silver will be combined with 1 dime of silver and 1 liter of grain for calculation. There are regulations for the price of ordinary cubic feet, either grain or silver. However, the construction sections are different, and the geological conditions are different. In the event of difficult work such as high banks on both sides, which takes time to send soil, and hard soil, which is difficult to excavate, the amount of soil that can be made in one day will inevitably be greatly reduced. If the price is still given according to the original regulations, it is not a fair way. Also, in ordinary places, the square price earned by each worker each day is only enough to feed themselves, and even if there is a surplus, it is not much. If there is no other remedy in case of continuous heavy rain that prevents work, there is bound to be a shortage of food. In view of the circumstances, two copies of the measures for adding grain to remote and difficult soil and for giving grain for rainy days when work is stopped have been prepared and sent to the Construction Department for review and filing. Director Liu Yiyan of the Department of Construction said that the proposed measures for adding grain to remote and difficult soil and for giving grain for rainy days when work is stopped are intended to consider the facts and supplement the original work relief method, and the review is still feasible. He specially signed a request to the Provincial Government for review and filing, which has been submitted to yesterday's standing meeting for resolution and approval. The two measures are recorded as follows: (Measures for Adding Relief Grain to Remote and Difficult Soil) 1. For those whose soil is far away more than 60 meters away, 5 liters to 1 liter of relief grain will be added for each cubic foot. 2. For those whose soil height is above 6 meters, 5 liters to 1 liter of relief grain will be added for each cubic foot. 3. For those whose soil is exceptionally hard and difficult to excavate, 5 liters to 1 liter of relief grain will be added for each cubic foot. 4. The above grain addition methods will be determined separately by the project offices within the limit according to the circumstances. (Measures for Giving Rations on Rainy Days When Work is Stopped) 1. If there is light rain during the work period, work shall not be stopped under any pretext. 2. If the work is completely stopped due to heavy rain for no more than two consecutive days, no additional grain will be given. 3. If the work is completely stopped due to heavy rain for more than two consecutive days, 1 liter of grain will be issued to each person per day from the third day. 4. If the number of days of work stoppage due to heavy rain is too long even if it is not continuous, the project offices will handle it according to the circumstances. (5th)</p>

<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Huangshan, the famous scenic spot in Southeastern China, has been opened up with the help of contemporary celebrities invited by the Anhui Provincial Government Construction Committee after the Wuhu-Tunxi and Huizhou-Hangzhou roads were opened. The Construction Department specially sent Secretary Xu Chuanyou and Technician Jin Youpeng to the mountain to supervise the work. It has been on a scale for a year, so-called preliminary construction is also. However, during the period when the Jiangxi bandits fled to Southern Anhui, the buildings that dotted the scenic spots on the mountain were slightly damaged. Now that the bandits have been pacified, they have been gradually restored, and the scattered bandits in the vicinity have also been cleaned up by the garrison troops, and the Huangshan area is as peaceful as ever. Therefore, Xu Shiying, the standing committee member of the Huangshan Construction Committee, went to the mountain to inspect the construction project. In the past two weeks, Zhang Zhizhong, the director of education of the Central Military Academy, Yao Wencai of Nanjing Anhui Middle School, Professors Wang Caibai, Zong Baihua, Zhang Shiqijia of Central University, Wang Songnian, the principal of Wuhu Guanzhong Middle School, and dozens of male and female students of the Department of Art of Central University have successively passed through Wuhu to Huangshan for sightseeing, which proves that the mountain is extremely safe. Xu Chuanyou and Jin Youpeng, the commissioners stationed in the mountain for supervision and construction, said that since Pu Bei entered the mountain in the middle of last month, the mountain peaches were in full bloom, and the orchids were fragrant, with both color and fragrance, which made people intoxicated. It is no different from a fairyland on earth, and the small birds are constantly playing music, which is even more moving and nostalgic. After a few days, the weather suddenly turned cold, and the spring snow suddenly fell. The Lion Forest cloud sea suddenly presented a vast and spectacular view. At that time, Cheng Guanlin, a staff member of the mountain, happened to be in the Lion Forest and wrote an article "Watching the Cloud Sea in the Snow" to record the different scenery. As for the construction plan of the mountain and the implementation plan for this year, Xu Jin will separately plan and implement them according to the economic urgency and the actual needs. (1) Transportation construction, 1. Repair the telephone, 2. Complete the road from Xiaoyao Pavilion to Xiaobu Bridge, 3. Open up the route surrounding the Taoyuan residential area, 4. Create the road along the stream of Ziyunji, 5. Select and repair the important embankment of Taoyuan Village and Ziyunji, (3) Survey and use land, 1.

Survey and draw a detailed map of the boundaries of each district, (3) Organize scenic spots, Taohua Peak is named for the peaches produced. In recent years, many mountain peaches have been killed by woodcutters. Xu Shiying has ordered them to be replanted in time, and ordered a plum forest to be built at the foot of Qingtan Peak, which is a grand view in the spring and autumn seasons. (4) Public buildings, 1. Repair the destroyed buildings, 2. Complete the unfinished projects of preliminary construction, 3. Construction Committee office buildings, 4. Raise funds to build barracks and bunkers, 5. Create parks and sports fields as a standard for construction. As for the expenses required, the Anhui Provincial Government will allocate them in stages so that the famous scenic spots in the Southeast can be completed as soon as possible. (5th)</p>

<p>Magistrate Ma, due to the frequent late arrivals and early departures of clerks in the One-Two-Three Counters and the Reed Tax Office, specially installed attendance books at each counter to ensure timely arrival and work.

<p>The Huainan salt production area was formerly divided into six fields: Xinshan, Wuyu, Anliang, Caodian, Fengjue, and Yuzhong. As the sea receded eastward and sandbanks expanded, the salt production in each field decreased daily, producing only 120,000 shi per year, which is less than one-fifth of the production in Huaibei. The field verification office has dispatched commissioners to inspect and decided on an improvement plan to move the fields closer to the sea and abandon the old "grass boiling" method, adopting the Huaibei solar salt production method. All former closed fields will be released for cultivation.</p>

<p>The Department of Finance telegraphed Nantong Magistrate Jin to, together with Director Bao of the Business Tax Bureau, take over the Nantong Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Office, which will be jointly collected by the Tax Bureau from now on.

They also submitted a request to the county government for subsidies for loaning capital and seeds. After investigating the existing farmers' loan capital of more than 3,000 yuan, it is proposed to allocate a loan capital of 3,000 yuan and 1,400+ shi of grain stored in the Food Management Office for loans and seeds, to relieve the urgent need for spring ploughing in the disaster-stricken area of Lake West. It is still ordered that each recipient provide proper guarantees and return the loans separately at the autumn harvest. A submission has already been made to the county for forwarding to the Civil Affairs and Construction Departments to expedite the allocation of relief funds.</p>

<p>The General Headquarters of the County Defense Corps, upon receiving orders to select the second training team for the 23rd year, was personally selected by County Magistrate Yang Zhanchun, who personally selected names from the roster. Those selected were all citizens of the intellectual class, preparing for three months of training to be appointed as Baojia chiefs and Defense Corps officers in the future. Therefore, all treatments are considered more favorable than the previous term. The food alone has been increased from 3.5 yuan to 5 yuan per person per month, and military uniforms and books are all free. However, the public misunderstood it as being conscripted into the army, and fled one after another, or feigned illness to avoid service. Therefore, although the quota was set at 170 people, as of yesterday, only 21 people had reported. The General Headquarters, considering that the deadline had passed and could not be extended any longer, specially dispatched personnel to the villages from yesterday onwards, limited to the shortest possible time, to gather at the General Headquarters, awaiting screening and team formation, and sending them to the province for training. If they continue to delay, they will be forced to carry out the order and seal up their houses.</p>

<p>The Shanghai preview of the London Exhibition of Chinese Art is now ready. Yesterday afternoon and morning, personnel from government agencies, Shanghai gentry, foreign guests, and related parties were invited to visit. The public exhibition will open today (the 8th) at 9:00 AM. Admission tickets are priced at two yuan per ticket and are sold at the Bank of China, the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank, the China National Products Company, and the China Travel Service Headquarters.</p>
<p>Exhibition Layout</p>
<p>The preview exhibition is located at the former site of the Bank of China on Shiji Road on the Bund. After the renovation by Huang Peijiang, the main entrance has been completely renewed. A banner with "Shanghai Preview of the London International Exhibition of Chinese Art" is hung over the entrance, with a flagpole and the national flag flying above it, making it extremely spectacular. Upon entering, there is a large lounge that can accommodate hundreds of people. Near the entrance is a guestbook for visitors to sign, and Chinese and English catalogs are available for sale. Around the room are displays of the Forbidden City Painting and Calligraphy Collection and the Forbidden City Weekly, which are available for sale during the exhibition. In addition, there is a cloakroom for guests to store clothing, hats, canes, and the like. Several kinds of flowers and trees are placed in the corners of the room, adding a lot of color. Exiting the room, follow the directional arrows to enter the first exhibition hall. On display here are paintings, calligraphy, folding fans, and embroidery from the Ming and Qing Dynasties. The second floor is divided into five exhibition halls. The second exhibition hall displays paintings and calligraphy from the Tang, Five Dynasties, Song, and Yuan Dynasties. The third hall displays bronzes. The fourth and fifth halls display porcelain from the Song, Jin, Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties. The sixth hall displays rare ancient books, jade artifacts, selected archaeological examples, cloisonné enamel, carved red lacquer, agate, and rhinoceros horn. The Peking Library has twenty ancient books that have not yet been delivered, so the hall has several slanting bone glass cabinets to display them when they arrive. Overall, there are no fewer than nine hundred items on display, ranging from the Shang and Zhou Dynasties to the Ming and Qing Dynasties, all of which are precious and extremely magnificent.</p>
<p>Grand Occasion Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 7th) at 8:00 AM, the exhibition hall opened its doors. Each member of the reception staff, wearing a blue gown and a black mandarin jacket with a reception badge, entered in an orderly manner and took up his position in each hall. The large lounge at the entrance and the small lounge inside were stocked with exquisite refreshments to welcome the guests. Key officials of the exhibition were also present to greet the guests. From 9:00 AM that day, the exhibition hall was busy with traffic and filled with Chinese and foreign guests. The exhibition presented each guest with a catalog for browsing. The grand occasion was unprecedented. In addition, dozens of people lingered outside the door without invitations, which shows the love of art in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Visiting Guests</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, those who were invited to inspect the Central Party and government committee members and heads of various ministries and commissions were Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, Yu Youren, Dai Jitao, Kong Xiangxi, Cai Yuanpei, Wu Tiecheng, Yang Shukan, Liang Hancao, Chen Guofu (represented by Yao Dingchen), Wang Zhengting (represented by Liu Yunfang), Xue Dubi, Zeng Zhongming, Wang Luyi, Gui Chongji, Luo Jialun, Zhang Daofan, Zhu Peide, Chen Shuren, Zhou Qigang, Tang Shengzhi, Wang Shijie, Chuan Rulin, and Zou Lin.

In the morning, the Minister of Education led the Education Department's director Lei Zhen and all reception staff to diligently greet the guests, presenting each person with a copy of the exhibition catalog.</p>
<p>Exhibition Arrangements</p>
<p>The exhibition hall is divided into two floors. The lower floor is for paintings and calligraphy, and part of the upper floor is also used for them. In front of each item, there is a wooden frame. To prevent the scroll from being too heavy, a silk ribbon is attached to the axis to secure it to the frame, avoiding damage. Books and albums are placed in glass display cases. Occupying most of the upper floor are bronzes, porcelain, jade artifacts, carved red lacquer, and other artifacts. Except for the scrolls, all items are displayed in glass cases. The display cases are sturdy and prevent fire. They can be disassembled, and there are small square seals on the screw joints, indicating strict security measures.</p>
<p>Overview of Paintings and Calligraphy</p>
<p>The reporter visited the preview twice yesterday, in the morning and afternoon. On the lower floor, the paintings and calligraphy of the Ming and Qing Dynasties were displayed, each with its own style in terms of brushwork and coloring. Among them, Shen Zhou's "Lu You Gao Tu," Chen Xianzhang's "Wan Yu Tu," Lu Ji's "Apricot Blossom and Peacock," Tang Yin's "Mountain Road Pine Sound," Qiu Ying's "Autumn River Waiting Ferry," Cui Zizhong's "Yin Bogu Tu," Guo Dian's "Crows and Geese at Dusk," Wang Hui's "Jiangcun Qingxia Tu" and "Yi Wu Xuan Tu," Yun Shouping's "Qiao Ke Xiu Zhu Tu," and Xue Tingxi's "Four Auspicious Celebrations," were particularly captivating, and visitors lingered, reluctant to leave. In the last room, glass cabinets displayed twenty folding fans, all the work of famous Ming and Qing artists such as Tang Yin, Qiu Ying, Wen Zhengming, and Dong Qichang. Ascending the stairs, the paintings and calligraphy from the Tang, Song, and Yuan Dynasties were displayed. First was Tang Xiaoli General (Zhaodao)'s "Luoyang Pavilion Diagram" and "Spring Outing Travel Diagram," as well as the works of an anonymous artist from the Five Dynasties. Preserved perfectly after a thousand years, they were truly rare sights. Next were the paintings and calligraphy of the Song Dynasty, such as Guo Xi's "Guan Shan Chun Xue," landscape paintings in color, Zhuang Gao Yi, Huizong's "Red Reed and White Goose," Li Di's "Returning Herdsman in Wind and Rain," Yan Cipings "Four Pleasures," an anonymous artist's "Moon Gazing in Empty Mountains," landscapes on cloth, Du Fu's "Beautiful Woman's Walk," and "Ruixue on Shanglin," and anonymous works. Yuan Dynasty works included Ni Yunlin's "Jiang'an Looking at Mountains" and an anonymous "Jiangtian Pavilion Tower". All of these works inspired countless sighs. In the glass cases were displayed the ink treasures and hand scrolls of famous figures from the Song, Yuan, and Ming Dynasties, such as the letters of the four great calligraphers Su, Huang, Mi, and Cai, Zhu Xi's letters, the hand scrolls of Zhao Mengfu and Huang Gongwang, and Xia Gui's "Ten Thousand Miles of the Yangtze River" scroll, which was over 33 feet long, a magnificent work depicting the entire Yangtze River from upstream to downstream. It was a pity that only a portion of it was displayed.</p>
<p>Song and Qing Embroidered Textiles</p>
<p>Next to the painting and calligraphy rooms, twenty-nine pieces of woven and embroidered silk from the Song and Qing Dynasties were displayed. Examples included Song Dynasty woven silk with water, flowers, and birds, especially white eagles, and Qing Dynasty woven silk depicting "Yu the Great Taming the Flood," "Zhou Chu Killing the Mosquitoes," "King Wu Receiving the Red Decree," and "Village Farmers Celebrating the Harvest." The exquisite weaving and embroidery were no different from paintings. Each scroll was imprinted with the Qianlong Imperial Treasure or added with an imperial postscript, making them extremely precious.</p>
<p>Bronzes, Porcelain, and Jade Artifacts</p>
<p>Next were the bronzes, classified and named with great precision, all from the Shang and Zhou Dynasties. The "Taotie Wen Lei," "Fang Lei Bu," "Zeng Bo Xi Hu," and "XX Gong Fang Zun" were all intricately carved. Their production dates were all over a thousand years before the Western calendar, five hundred years earlier than the Greek era, and a thousand years earlier than the Roman unification of Italy, proving that the culture and civilization of our country at that time were far ahead of Europe and the West. The bronzes from the Chu Kingdom unearthed in Shouxian, Anhui Province, were particularly rare and precious. Next were the porcelain pieces, all produced by famous kilns of the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties. There were many types, and the craftsmanship was exquisite, unmatched by modern times. Next were the cloisonné enamel and the jade artifacts. Among them, the yellow jade linked ring seal with three seals and a chain were all carved from a single piece of jade, making the workmanship quite difficult.</p>
<p>Ancient Books and Oracle Bones</p>
<p>Finally, there were oracle bones, oracle bone weapons, and bronze weapons from the Academia Sinica, arranged in order, providing insight into the history of early human evolution. Next to them were rare ancient books, including Southern Song carved editions and Jin XXX editions, the earliest printed books in the world, as Europeans only began to manufacture paper in 1276, more than a hundred years after printing in our country. Next to the cabinets was an empty cabinet reserved for the rare books selected by the Peking Library. These ancient books would arrive and be displayed in the coming days.</p>
<p>Opening Today</p>
<p>The preview exhibition will officially open this morning. There will be no ceremony, and the public will be able to visit. In response to requests from all parties, the preparatory committee decided to add items used by Emperor Gaozong of the Qing Dynasty to the display to satisfy the visitors' wishes.

<p>A dispatch from the Central News Agency reports that Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan, left Nanjing by night train at 11 o'clock the night before last and arrived at Zhenru at 7:10 yesterday morning. He went directly to his private residence on Bubbling Well Road to rest. President Wang's visit was to preside over the Shanghai preview of the London International Exhibition of Chinese Art and to host a reception for leaders from various circles in Shanghai. He returned to Nanjing by night train that evening. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning, Returned to Nanjing Last Night</p>
<p>President Wang, along with Zeng Zhongming, took a night train from Nanjing to Shanghai at 11 o'clock the night before last. He arrived at Zhenru Station at 7:10 yesterday morning. Those who came to welcome him included Yang Hu, Director of the Shanghai Security Bureau, and Wang Zhinan, Secretary, and many others. The Zhenru Station and the Zhongshan Road area were guarded by security teams and police squadrons, and security was very tight. After Wang got off the train, he and Zeng Zhongming changed to a car and went directly to his private residence on Bubbling Well Road to rest. In addition to Zeng Zhongming, Ma Chaojun and Zhu Peide also accompanied him. President Wang and Zeng Zhongming returned to Nanjing on a special train car attached to the 12 o'clock night train last night.</p>

<p>Wang Talks to Reporters</p>
<p>President Wang met with reporters from various newspapers at the Bank of China yesterday morning. According to him, the National Economic Construction Movement advocated by Chairman Chiang is what the people of the country should strive for recently. In the future, opinions from all parties will be gathered to formulate a complete plan. There is currently no special progress on international loans. As for the rumor that the government will convene a monetary conference, it is not accurate. This time, I am hosting leaders from various circles in Shanghai for ordinary social purposes and there is no other special significance.</p>

<p>The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee, in order to stabilize the market, planned to purchase 20 million silver dollars and transport them to Shanghai to regulate the financial market. It entrusted the Hong Kong branches of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to handle the matter. It successively purchased about 3 million Hong Kong silver dollars. Later, due to the shortage of cash in Hong Kong, it changed to purchasing from London, England. The first batch of 3 million silver dollars has arrived in Shanghai. The second batch, loaded on the British Steamship Company's Lunxi, arrived yesterday morning and docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf on Broadway Road. Yesterday was Sunday, and the customs office was closed as usual. It was decided that starting today, employees of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Bank of Communications would be dispatched to unload and store the silver dollars in the vaults of the three banks. As for the total amount, a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency met with a committee member of the committee last night, who said that it was more than 4 million silver dollars. As for the saying that another 1 million silver dollars would arrive tomorrow, he had not heard of it.</p>

<p>According to personnel of the Japanese Legation, the proposals of each consul had been sent to Shanghai in advance and had been classified and included in the conference agenda by the legation. However, most of them were reports, such as the diplomatic, commercial, and political situation in the areas where each consul was stationed, as well as the issue of anti-Japanese goods, with attached opinions for the conference to study. At the meeting tomorrow, Japanese Minister Ariyoshi Akira will preside, and the secretaries of the legation will be responsible for the records.

<h3 id="e126">Former Governor of the Philippines Arrived in Shanghai, Plans to Stay for Two Months Before Returning to the United States <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Harrison, the former American Governor of the Philippines, recently arrived in Shanghai from Europe with his fourth wife. He arrived at the port on the Italian ship Conte Verde the day before yesterday afternoon. After arriving in Shanghai, Harrison was unwilling to express any opinions on the issue of Philippine independence. He only said that since he left the Philippines in 1921, he had never done any research on the politics of the island, so it was inconvenient for him to talk about it. Harrison was born in New York, USA in 1873, graduated from Yale University in 1895, participated in the Spanish-American War, served as a member of the US Congress from 1903 to 1913, and was promoted to Governor of the Philippines in the same year, until he resigned in 1921. This time he came from Scotland, England, and will stay in Shanghai for two months before returning to the United States.</p>

<p>According to Hua Dong News Agency, Wang Zhiyuan, Secretary-General of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, came to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning. A reporter from Hua Dong News Agency met him at the Shanghai preview of the London Art Exhibition and immediately asked him about the current situation of overseas Chinese. According to Wang, in the past, overseas Chinese were affected by the world market recession, so it was difficult to maintain their businesses, and they returned to China one after another. However, recently, the industry and commerce in the Nanyang Islands and other places will enter a period of recovery, and overseas Chinese can still gain a foothold, so the current situation is still good. Recently, overseas Chinese going abroad have been very enthusiastic. Wang also said that the Qiaole Village set up by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission in Anhui has achieved good results, especially the returned overseas Chinese who can work hard to manage and develop the village. The village is currently limited to single overseas Chinese, and in the future, it is planned to allow overseas Chinese to live with their families and children.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Li Mingyu's Arrest Case, Lawyers Lou and Xu Write to Various Circles, The French Consul General Has Not Yet Responded, Which is a Deep Regret, Jin Xi's Old Hatred Has Not Ended, and Mr. Cui's New Creation Has Arrived Again, Hoping that Various Circles Will Urge the Authorities to Make Strong Protests <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, lawyers Lou Yunmei and Xu Jie released a letter to various circles yesterday regarding the arrest of Cui Yingxin (aka Li Mingyu), a Korean naturalized in China. The original text is excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Cui Quxin's Arrest Process</p>
<p>To all compatriots, please be aware that the existence of foreign concessions within our country is based on the exercise of the national administrative power and allows foreign residents to have the right to reside in groups. It does not mean that our country loses its sovereignty within the concessions. The establishment of the French Concession Police Department in Shanghai is based on the agreement on the establishment of a Chinese court in the Shanghai French Concession. According to Article 6 of the agreement, any criminal arrested in the concession, excluding holidays, should be sent to the competent court within 24 hours. If the court is not delivered after the deadline, the criminal should be released immediately. Furthermore, according to the first paragraph of Article 7, no criminal may be transferred to government offices outside the concession without first being interrogated by the competent court. However, the Shanghai French Concession Police Department suddenly arrested Cui Yingxin (aka Li Mingyu), a Korean naturalized in our country on June 13, 1925, at Xiechengli, Rue de la Mission in March 26 of this year. At that time, Cui presented his naturalization certificate to explain the misunderstanding and requested exemption from detention. However, the police department ignored it and confiscated the naturalization certificate.</p>
<p>The French Consul General's Office Has Not Yet Responded</p>
<p>Later, Cui's wife hired our lawyers to negotiate with them, but it was ineffective. We received a reply from Mr. Gable of the Police Department on April 4, stating that he had been handed over to the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai on the same day. We then visited the French Consul General Baili Ong to reason with him. He claimed that he was completely unaware of the incident. Although he agreed to investigate and handle the matter according to law, more than ten days have passed and there has been no response. We cannot help but feel infinite regret. Since Cui has been naturalized in China, regardless of whether he is suspected of committing a crime, he should be bound by the above-mentioned agreement and handed over to the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court for trial. How can he be arrested and handed over arbitrarily? This kind of behavior not only endangers the safety of residents in the French Concession, but simply destroys our country's sovereignty. How can all our citizens silently accept it? It is found that the police department has arrested Koreans naturalized in our country more than once without any reason. Jin Xi's old hatred has not ended (Jin Xi was arrested by the French Consulate in Shanghai in October 1922 and transferred to the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai), and Mr. Cui's new creation has arrived again. How can we bear such arbitrary destruction? And this time, Mr. Cui's arrest was unknown to the French Consul General's Office, so the strangeness of the situation is even more different from the past. Leaving aside the fact that France is also an advanced country of independent countries, whether legally or rationally, the French Police Department should not accept a letter of entrustment from the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai and hand over the criminal directly, willingly acting as an affiliated institution of another country and losing its status as a great power. Our country is not comparable to a country that has been subjugated and has completely lost its sovereignty. How can we despise it so much?</p>
<p>Urge the Authorities to Make Every Effort to Protest</p>
<p>We believe that the reason why Koreans have been happy to naturalize in our country in recent years is because they are unwilling to be humiliated by the subjugation of their country, and they share the same feelings for the revolution, hoping to move towards a bright field. Then, how should our country uphold Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions, unite with small and weak nations, and struggle together? Now, we cannot provide the minimum level of residence protection, and they are being destroyed by foreign countries in our country. If we were in their position, what attitude would people take towards our country? Our lawyers are speaking according to the law and are reluctant to make too many comments. Fortunately, there are still celebrities in the country who will definitely understand the interests of China and Korea. How should we urge the authorities to make strong protests against this unacceptable infringement? It is not too late to mend the fold after a sheep is lost. It is not possible to seek real benefits for Mr. Cui alone, and when the Sino-French agreement expires, it will not be difficult to use it as a basis for negotiation when advocating the recovery of police power. Our lawyers have more than enough heart but not enough strength, so we will list the details of the case to present it. We hope that all compatriots will not ignore it because it is Mr. Cui's personal matter.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Vocational Supplementary Night School for Muslims Established in Shanghai <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Muslim people in this city have made a lot of progress in education in recent years, but vocational supplementary education is still lacking. Now, there are enthusiastic people in the church who, in view of the fact that the huge waves of economic panic in recent years have hit Muslim workers not shallowly, the strategy to save them depends on the promotion of vocational education. They have established a Muslim Vocational Supplementary Night School. Preparations have been made for several months. It is reported that the first free enrollment of the school has begun, and the entrance examination will be held at 5:00 this afternoon (8th) and classes will begin on the 10th. The school is located in the China Islamic Association on Fangbang Road in the city. In addition to the board of directors organized by famous Muslims such as Jiang Hanzhai to supervise and guide the school affairs, the educational affairs are generally undertaken by experts such as Chuantongxian, Wang Yi, and Lu Zhongxiang. The declaration of the school is attached below. The survival of the fittest is the law of nature. The greater our ability to adapt to the environment, the more opportunities we have to survive. If we cannot adapt to the environment, we will be eliminated. This is the inevitable reason. The changes in the environment are endless. If we want to cope with this changing environment, we must increase our ability to adapt in order to survive. The economic recession has spread all over the world. Our country, with its immature education and sluggish industry, is particularly affected by the storm. Therefore, rural areas are bankrupt and business is declining. Those who are weak in their ability to cope with this environment are all severely affected, resulting in elimination. There are many Muslims in Shanghai, but most of them seek practical business experience. They have no time to take care of world business conditions and economic knowledge, and the lack of education and knowledge is a common situation. When this economic storm arrives, they are panicked and unable to cope with it, and can only wait for the natural distribution. How can those who know sit idly by and watch countless members of the church be destroyed by this reverse current without thinking of giving them a little ability to adapt to it in order to struggle? People like us are not sensitive, and we are willing to contribute a little bit of effort in our spare time to help the members of the church cope with this recessionary environment. Therefore, we have organized the Shanghai Muslim Vocational Supplementary Night School. Its basic work is to seek the infusion of general knowledge, and its ideal is to cultivate strong adapters. People like us are talented and shallow, and we cannot achieve this grand wish. We only hope to throw a brick to attract jade. One day, our Muslim church will have a more perfect and more beautiful similar movement and organization, then people like us will shout wildly to wish it eternal. The flagship Izumo will be repaired in Japan.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Government recently received an instruction from the Jiangsu Finance Department, stating that the county still has a so-called Original Public Funds and Public Property Management Office. What is its nature and why has it not been abolished as ordered? It was ordered to investigate and reply. County Magistrate Pan checked that the Original Public Funds and Public Property Management Office manages the original public funds and public property. At present, the public funds and public property shared by the city and county, although the Shanghai Municipal Government has ordered the Municipal Finance Bureau to reorganize the Evaluation Committee and convene a meeting of representatives of the city and county related agencies to divide them, the division has not yet been completed. Therefore, he reported to the Finance Department, requesting that after the division of funds and property is clear and each manages it separately, it should be abolished at that time. It has been approved by Director Zhao's instruction.</p>

<p>Busy Zi, the sixteen-year-old daughter of Madam Yuan Wei, a resident of No. 312 Zha Pu Road from Gaoyou, is beautiful and clever. Her mother cherishes her like a precious jewel. On the afternoon of the second of this month at 3:00 PM, Zhang Chunxiang, a twenty-year-old woman from the same hometown and a friend (working at a massage parlor near the Dongyang Garden on Dixiwei Road, known for being frivolous), lured Busy Zi out of her home. She did not return that night. Yuan Wei searched everywhere the next morning but could not find her. Later, she learned that it was Zhang who had taken her away, so she reported the situation to the Hongkou Police Station. The detective chief sent detectives to secretly go with her to the address around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday and bring Zhang Chunxiang to the police station. She was then transferred to the women's detention center. Yesterday, she was taken to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The lawyer of the Public Works Department, Li Zhishan, explained the situation and said that Yuan's daughter was invited by the defendant to watch a movie at the Rongguang Cinema on Haining Road. There, a tea server named Li Abao fell in love with her and secretly hid her to live together. However, whether this is true or not cannot be determined yet. He requested that the case be postponed for further investigation and that the defendant be detained. Then, Yuan Wei testified about the disappearance of her daughter, saying that the defendant often came to her house to chat with Busy Zi. She knew that the defendant’s behavior was improper, so she disliked her very much. She had never met Li Abao before. When questioned, the defendant claimed that Busy Zi had known Li Abao for a long time, and she did not call Busy Zi out or go there herself. However, she did see Busy Zi and Li Abao whispering to each other at the entrance of Kunshan Garden, but she did not know what they were saying. Her testimony was evasive. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered her to be remanded in custody for further investigation and verification.</p>

<p>Wei Tao Lan, a woman residing at No. 25, Lane 100, Henry Road in the French Concession, is twenty-two years old this year and a native of Nanjing, also known as Yangzhou. The day before yesterday afternoon, she was driving her own car, license plate number 11818, along Dada Road in the French Concession from east to west. When she reached the front of No. 409, west of the Dongzilaihuo Street intersection, an elderly man named Wang Huaiyu, about sixty years old, wearing monk robes, was crossing the road from south to north. Wei immediately braked, but the rear right fender of her car still collided with Wang, causing him to fall to the ground. A patrolman saw this, recorded the license plate number, helped Wang into Wei's car, and took him to the police station. The detective chief ordered him to be sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, Wang died at 3:30 AM the next morning due to his injuries. The hospital notified the police station, who sent detectives to transport the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Parlor for an autopsy. As no relatives of the deceased were found, the police station reported to the Second Special District Court, which appointed Prosecutor Wang Ren to come to the parlor with a forensic doctor and a clerk to examine the body. They then held a court hearing. First, the Western detective Kelaixi (transliteration) reported the investigation of the case. The official then questioned the defendant, Wei Tao Lan, and the witness, Wei Jiqing (thirty years old, from Yangzhou, the defendant's elder brother, working as a partner at a cigarette and paper shop at No. 90, Father Jin Road, who was also in the defendant's car at the time of the incident), about what happened. They ruled that Wang Huaiyu died from injuries sustained from being knocked down. The body was photographed and prepared for burial by the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Parlor. Whether the defendant was at fault would be investigated and dealt with by the police department. After the autopsy, the defendant, Wei Tao Lan, paid for a coffin and clothing, which were delivered to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Parlor for burial yesterday. The body will be transported to the cemetery pending family identification.</p>

Then, the Chinese and Western detective chiefs reported the details of the case. The evidence was presented for inspection. After Judge Wu Zehan questioned the defendants and obtained clear confessions, he sentenced Jiang Miaolin to one year and two months in prison, Qiu Agen and Shao Quangen to fifty days of detention each, and Wang Ahua to forty days.

<p>Hou Xiang Sheng, a native of this county, is over fifty years old and lives in Houjiazhai, Jiangwan, earning a living by farming. His wife, Li, only gave birth to one daughter, Xi Nv, who is twenty-four years old and cherished. Because Hou Xiang Sheng was worried about having no son, he sought a good son-in-law to rely on in the future. In December of the 21st year of the Republic of China, through an intermediary, he recruited Li Xiang Lin (twenty-five years old, a carpenter) to live with them. At the beginning, they got along well. Later, Li Xiang Lin had bad luck and lost his job, staying idle at home. Since then, the family has been uneasy. A young man sitting at home eating and doing nothing inevitably faced the disdain of Hou and his daughter. In society, a strong-willed daughter-in-law is pitied. Even the slightest mistake is criticized, leading to both laughter and tears. He attempted suicide several times without success. Recently, Li Xi Nv hired lawyer Hu Yuanjun to file for divorce from her husband, Li Xiang Lin, in the mediation court of the local court. The reason was that her husband did not engage in proper work, but instead ate and relied on others. If she slightly advised him, he would think he had lost face and start quarrels. He had previously injured himself and falsely accused her, but fortunately, the court saw through his trick and dismissed the case. Recently, he even tried to kill her with a knife, which was taken away by neighbors. Such situations were not uncommon. If this continued, the Hou father and daughter would suffer greatly. Therefore, they were forced to file a petition requesting permission to divorce. After receiving the petition, the court held a hearing yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Pang Shurong. The defendant, Li Xiang Lin, did not appear. Only the petitioner, Hou Xi Nv, and lawyer Hu appeared in court and testified about the situation. The judge said that since the testimony was one-sided, it was difficult to believe. He said that family lawsuits were different from other civil lawsuits and required the defendant to appear in person to express his intentions. Since the defendant did not appear today, mediation was impossible. He ordered that a formal lawsuit could be filed five days later. After the ruling, the court adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e140">China-Philippines Telephone Communications Actively Underway, China-Canada Communications Currently Stalled <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The International Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, in order to facilitate international telecommunications, has been actively negotiating with various countries around the world to establish telephone and telegraph communications. It has already achieved this with many countries. Currently, it is also in contact with Canada for telegraph communications and with the Philippines for telephone communications. According to a reporter from the Central News Agency who inquired with the bureau, the Canadian side has not yet responded to the request for telegraph communications, so it remains in a stalled state. Once the Canadian side agrees, it can proceed. As for telephone communications with the Philippines, it is actively underway and is expected to be realized in the near future. Previously, the bureau purchased approximately one hundred acres of land in Zhenru Liuhang for the purpose of expanding cable lines. It is understood that the construction project is currently in progress.</p>
<h3 id="e141">City Infectious Disease Hospital, New Building Officially Completed, Future Efforts to Expand and Improve, Further Construction of Kitchen and Wards Planned <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, recognizing that various infectious diseases are prevalent in the city, sought to protect the health of its citizens. Therefore, it obtained approval from the Municipal Government several years ago to establish an infectious disease hospital at the original site of the Zhabei Public Hospital. However, the old buildings inside were not suitable for use, so a new building was rebuilt. It has now been officially completed. In the future, it is planned to expand and add seven wards to make it complete. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>New Building Completed</p>
<p>The Municipal Infectious Disease Hospital was established on the original site of the former Zhabei Public Hospital. It began admitting patients on March 10th of last year. However, the health bureau authorities believed that the original hospital buildings were not suitable for isolation and could not accommodate a large number of beds. The buildings on the east side of the hospital were destroyed during the Shanghai War and could not be repaired. Therefore, to facilitate treatment and management, it obtained approval from the Municipal Government to allocate 37,000 yuan to plan and build a new building in conjunction with the Public Works Bureau in the spring of last year. Construction began in early July, including the construction of two new-style wards, each capable of accommodating thirty-five beds. The internal facilities were all new-style and easy to isolate and disinfect. The project has now been fully completed and officially opened.</p>
<p>Plans for Expansion</p>
<p>According to Wu Liguo, the director of the hospital, although the new building has been rebuilt and officially established, it has not been possible to expand as much as desired due to limited funds, which is regrettable. It is planned to gradually develop as the city treasury becomes more abundant. Currently, the most urgent need for improvement is the kitchen. Whether the kitchen of an infectious disease hospital is clean or not is of great importance. The current kitchen of the hospital is quite simple. It is planned to raise funds in the near future and immediately build it. As for the wards, seven more wards need to be added so that the nine statutory infectious diseases can each have their own place for isolation. In other aspects, such as disinfection, because the existing disinfection room is too small, it is also planned to build another corner. In short, the hospital will expand as much as its economic power allows to make the interior more complete.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Minsheng Company's Minquan Ship Launched Yesterday, Ship's Equipment is Extremely Perfect <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The Minquan ship, newly built by Minsheng Industrial Company, was launched for trial operation yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. It departed from the Qiuxin Factory on Jichang Street in the Nanshi District and traveled to Longhua, where it stopped on the river. The reporter also went on the ship. The Shanghai manager of the company, Mr. Zhang Shusen, gave a detailed account of the ship's situation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>History of the Minquan</p>
<p>The ship was originally named Longmao and owned by the British Longmao Foreign Firm. In the 13th year of the Republic of China, it was sold by Jiangmao Foreign Firm to Taikoo Foreign Firm and renamed Wanliu. In the 22nd year of the Republic of China, after it was sold to the company, it began to be rebuilt, which took more than ten months to complete. It is 29 feet and 11 inches long, 31 feet wide, 10 feet deep, and has a draft of 8.4 feet. The speed is approximately 14 nautical miles per hour. The gross tonnage is 1191.76 tons, and the net tonnage is 686.17 tons.</p>
<p>Capacity of the Ship</p>
<p>The ship can carry more than 1,900 bales of cotton yarn and accommodate 164 passengers. Each person has a comfortable berth. The need for steerage berths is greatest on direct voyage ships. The largest passenger cabin on a ship traveling on the Sichuan River is the Mingui of this company, which can only carry 112 people. Now the Minquan ship can accommodate 50 more people, especially in the steerage berths.</p>
<p>Layout of the Cabins</p>
<p>The large deluxe cabins are located on the third floor. The front section has five rooms, each accommodating two people, with complete equipment and everything available. The official cabins are located at the rear of the third floor and have nine rooms, each accommodating two people (most of the official cabins on ships have upper and lower berths, but on the Minquan ship, each person occupies one berth) and each has a wardrobe. The room cabins are located on the second floor. The front section has seven rooms, each accommodating four people. The steerage cabins are located at the rear of the second floor and are divided into male and female cabins. The male steerage cabin can accommodate 92 people, and the female steerage cabin can accommodate 16 people (ships do not usually have female steerage cabins, which is inconvenient for single female passengers. This is unique to the Minquan ship).</p>
<p>Air Circulation</p>
<p>The light and ventilation in the ship's cabins of all classes are very complete. Not only do the large deluxe cabins have ventilation windows, but the steerage cabins also have a ventilation window, all leading directly to the top floor for air circulation, making it cool in summer. In addition, all classes of cabins and lounges have heating equipment.</p>
<p>Sanitary Equipment</p>
<p>The large deluxe cabins have one male and one female bathroom each, and two male and two female toilets each. The official cabins have one male and one female bathroom each, and two male and two female toilets each. The room cabins have one male and one female bathroom each, and one male and one female toilet each. The steerage cabins have one male and one female bathroom each, five male toilets, and two female toilets.</p>
<p>Luxurious Lounges</p>
<p>The ship's fourth-class cabins all have lounges, so that guests have a place to relax after meals. The ones in the large deluxe cabins and official cabins are even more magnificent, with carpets, table covers, chair covers, curtains, vases, etc., all being domestic products. The lights in each lounge are installed around the edges of the ceiling, so that the light is emitted from all around, not too strong, and more aesthetically pleasing, and can also avoid the gathering of small insects in summer and autumn.</p>
<p>Sand Filtered Drinking Water</p>
<p>Most ships use alum to clarify and precipitate passenger drinking water, which is already considered elaborate, but it cannot be thoroughly clarified. This ship uses extremely fine sand to filter the water, making the filtered water extremely clean, emphasizing hygiene.</p>
<p>Legitimate Pastimes</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned features, the ship also has books, a radio receiver, a bulletin board, ordinary musical instruments, etc., for the entertainment of passengers.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Oriental Hotel, Man and Woman Both Poison Themselves, Promising Young People Should Not Commit Suicide, Sacrificing Marriage is Especially Undesirable <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>At about 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, a young man and woman suddenly arrived at the Oriental Hotel at the intersection of Xizang Road and Beihai Road, opening room number 410 on the fourth floor. They paid a deposit of three dollars. The man signed his name as Dai Hexiang, 23 years old, from Jiashan, a businessman. The woman signed her name as Yang Huizhen, 25 years old, from the same hometown as the man, and a top student at a certain school in Jiashan. When they went to bed that night, there was nothing unusual. However, at about 11:00 AM yesterday, when the hotel waiter routinely asked the guests whether they wanted to continue staying, there was no sound in the room. The waiter realized that something was wrong and managed to pry open the door. He saw the woman lying stiffly in the bed and the man lying upright outside the bed with his feet on the ground, barely breathing. He quickly reported to the Laozha Police Station, who sent detectives to take them to Renji Hospital by car. However, they both had been poisoned too severely and died shortly after. The bodies were sent to the coroner's office for examination. It is said that the reason for their suicide was that they could not control their own marriage.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Missing One Seal on a Transfer Slip, Attempting to Defraud One Thousand Yuan, Shen Heqing Suddenly Appeared, The Court Must Investigate the Case <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>There was business dealings between the Xie Feng Foreign Cloth Store at No. 2, Lane 249, Ningbo Road, and the Yongxing Money Shop at No. 11, Lane 120, Ningbo Road. If Xie Feng needed to draw cash from a check, it would instruct its apprentice to go to Yongxing to collect it with a transfer slip. However, the seals on the transfer slip for issuing checks and collecting cash were of two different styles. At 1:10 PM the day before yesterday, Xie Feng sent apprentice He Yaoliang with a transfer slip to Yongxing to collect a check paper worth 245 yuan with a ten-day term. However, when He was passing the intersection of Henan Road and Beijing Road, a man from Ningbo named Shen Heqing suddenly chased after him from behind and told He that he had just received instructions from the manager saying that he needed to collect another 1,000 yuan in cash. So, he took the transfer slip and filled out a receipt for 1,000 yuan in cash. He, unaware that it was a fraud, took the slip to Yongxing. After the shop examined the transfer slip, they suspected it because Xie Feng always had a different seal when collecting cash. So, they called Xie Feng, who told them that they had no request to collect 1,000 yuan in cash. Based on this, they questioned He, who told them everything. The shop then wrapped a package in paper, simulating a 1,000-yuan bill, and instructed He to return to the store along the same route, while sending someone to secretly follow him. However, when He was walking to the intersection of Henan Road, Shen Heqing indeed came forward again, intending to take the 1,000-yuan bill. He was then captured by the pursuers, patrolman Geng Debiao and Chinese constables No. 3358. Shen was arrested and taken to the general police station. Yesterday, he was taken to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, explained the case and prosecuted him under Article 226, Section 1 of the Criminal Law. When questioned, Shen Heqing only claimed that he was temporarily confused. Judge Feng Shide reviewed the confession and ruled that the case still needed investigation and ordered his detention. The case will be heard again at a later date.</p>

<p>Jin Jiulin, Inspector General of the Special Agency of the French General Police Department, detectives Zhang Ziying, Zhou Bingcheng, and Bao Tan Cui Zhenguo, etc., arrested the famous kidnapping gang Geng Huatang (from Jinan, former adjutant of the Songhu Military Governor's Office), Zheng Tangsheng (local, former practitioner at the Gold Exchange), Shang Zhen (from Henan, former division commander), Liu Yimin (from Yangzhou, first a car driver, then a soldier), Wu Shaoting (from Yangzhou, former employee on the Taikoo Yangtze River liner), and more than ten others in Tianjin in July of the 22nd year of the Republic of China. They were transferred to Shanghai and investigated for conspiring to kidnap Huang Yuqi, deputy director of the Zhongnan Bank, Chen Yanghe, associate of the Siming Bank, He Shaoting, owner of the Xinsenji Construction Factory, Gu Zelin, son of Yunnan Division Commander Gu Zizhen, Huang Baohua, a wealthy dye merchant, etc., from the winter of the 19th year of the Republic of China to the spring of the 22nd year of the Republic of China. They were also charged with murdering their partner, Xiao Shaoxing, and abandoning the body, and kidnapping Chen Zhuling and Liang Huiwu, compradors of Jardine Matheson, in Tianjin, tearing up the tickets and burying the bodies to destroy evidence, etc. They were sent to the Second Special District Local Court, and the police department filed a public prosecution in accordance with the Law on Punishing Bandits. At the end of the trial, while awaiting judgment, Geng committed suicide by hanging himself in the police station's detention center. A few days later, Zheng and Shang also committed suicide by hanging themselves in the detention center at the same time. The guards discovered and rescued them, and they were sent to the hospital for treatment. Subsequently, on October 14th of the same year, Zheng, Shang, Liu, and Wu were sentenced to death, with permanent deprivation of civil rights. The remaining defendants were declared innocent and released. Zheng, Shang, Liu, and Wu refused to accept the judgment and hired Zhu Dian and Fan Gang, lawyers, etc., to represent them. They presented reasons and submitted a petition to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, requesting a retrial. With the approval of the Civil Affairs Department of the Provincial Government, the case was sent back to the Second Special District Court for retrial. Wang Gangxu, the chief of the Criminal Division, repeatedly held court sessions for research and questioning. Each defendant overturned the original trial's confessions, denying participation in kidnapping for ransom, and presented various counter-evidence. The court, not being reluctant to seek details, transferred documents to Tianjin, Hangzhou, Yichang, Chuzhou, Putuoshan, and other organs, groups, and temples for investigation, and summoned the victims and witnesses presented by Zheng and others to the court for identification and cross-examination. The details have been previously reported. It is now learned that the retrial of this case began on November 8th of the 22nd year of the Republic of China and has lasted for one and a half years. The court has been held more than ten times. Although each defendant has overturned the original trial's confessions, the confessions made in each court session are also inconsistent and contradictory. At 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, Judge Wang held a court session for further trial. Fei Xizhen, a lawyer from the police department, appeared in court, and the defense lawyers hired by the defendants also arrived on time. The judge first ordered each defendant to be questioned one by one, and then summoned the abbot of the Baoben Hall of Putuoshan, Monk Xin Zheng, to court. After questioning Shang Zhen about his arrival and departure from the mountain, the court considered the investigation of evidence to be complete and ordered the debate to begin. After Fei, the lawyer from the police department, and the lawyers for each defendant debated in succession, the court declared the debate concluded and scheduled the sentencing for the 12th. Zheng was still remanded to the detention center to await instructions.</p>

<p>Tang Sanbian, a Cantonese residing at No. 117, Ronghua Lane, Xinjihang Road, is 44 years old and works at the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company factory, earning about one hundred yuan per month. Li Lin, a colleague of Tang's, died of illness in the 20th year of the Republic of China. Because Tang was a close friend of Li's, he often visited Li's home. Unexpectedly, he developed a relationship with Li's wife, Xie. He then rented a room at No. 45, Tongqing Lane, Broadway Road. On November 29th of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, she gave birth to a daughter named Ailian. Recently, Tang suddenly stopped visiting her. After she learned that Tang actually had another wife, she sued Tang for abandonment, etc., in the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. As a result, she lost the case. Now, Xie has hired a lawyer to file another lawsuit for support in the Civil Division of the First Special District Court. Yesterday, Judge Peng Shi held a hearing in the Fourteenth Court. Tang Sanbian claimed to be ill and did not attend. His lawyer attended on his behalf. Xie stated the details of her relationship with Tang and claimed that she was currently suing the defendant for four reasons: (1) to confirm that she is a member of Tang Sanbian's family, (2) to confirm that Ailian was born to Tang Sanbian, (3) to order Tang to pay her 2,500 yuan for living expenses, and (4) to order him to pay her 3,400 yuan for Ailian's education expenses. She also presented four letters written by Tang in his own handwriting to prove the relationship between the plaintiff and Ailian and the defendant. Tang's lawyer denied that the defendant had a cohabitation relationship with the plaintiff. Judge Peng ruled that the case still needed to be summoned and rescheduled the hearing.</p>

<p>Xin Xin News reports: Regarding the case of the city's rickshaw pullers requesting the British Works Department to cancel rickshaw registration and recover the rickshaw pullers' mutual aid society, the issue remains unresolved. On the 6th, the association again sent representatives to petition the city government, requesting them to negotiate with the British Works Department. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Representatives Petition</p>
<p>Rickshaw puller representatives Chen Guoxie and others, seeking to negotiate with the British Works Department authorities to cancel rickshaw registration and recover the rickshaw pullers' mutual aid society, so that labor and management can handle it themselves, went to the city center district on the morning of the 6th, to petition the city government authorities, requesting assistance. Secretary Guo of the city government and Yu Mingde, staff member of the Second Section, received them. Representative Chen Guoliang and others then detailed the significance of their petition, pointing out the various inappropriate measures of Zhu Liancheng and others. As a result, Mr. Yu indicated that the city government had received a communication from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and had ordered the Public Utilities Bureau to fully investigate and report on all matters handled by the Bureau, and then legally negotiate with the British Works Department, with the intention of recovering Chinese rights.</p>
<p>External Instructions</p>
<p>The rickshaw pullers' union received instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday. The original text is copied below: Instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs No. 3114. Original petitioner: Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers' Union. Presentation of a case requesting the Shanghai Municipal Council to hand over the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society to the labor and management of the rickshaw pullers themselves for self-management. The presentation and attachments have been reviewed. A communication has been sent to the Shanghai Municipal Government requesting investigation and verification. You are hereby notified. Attached for safekeeping. April 2nd, 24th year of the Republic of China. Minister Wang.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Puller Suicide</p>
<p>According to news from the union, Liu Dianyuan, a native of Funing, aged 43, earned a living pulling a rickshaw for the Miliji Car Company at No. 88 Dakang Lane in the French Concession. Recently, because rickshaw pullers must register to pull a rickshaw, he went to the rickshaw registration office of the Municipal Council twice to register, but failed to be admitted. The rickshaw puller was disappointed at not being able to register, and unable to pull a rickshaw. The livelihood of his family of five was cut off, causing him indescribable worry. Suddenly, yesterday, he hanged himself in the middle of the night. He has no clothing or coffin. The situation is tragic. His wife, Liu Hu, sought help from the rickshaw pullers' union yesterday afternoon. Chen Guoliang, the general representative of the rickshaw pullers, took the responsibility to find ways to assist in the funeral arrangements.</p>

<p>In addition to the main drainage ditches that have been built successively along Lujia Hong Road and Pu Zhao Road in the southern and western districts of Shanghai, the roads east of Rihui Port have traditionally relied on open ditches for drainage. Every summer and autumn, stagnant water accumulates in low-lying areas, making it difficult to drain, which directly affects the public health of citizens and indirectly harms the road surface. In view of this, the Municipal Works Bureau presented a proposal to the Municipal Government, which was approved to lay main drainage ditches in Xietu Road (from Manufacturing Bureau Road to Xiaomu Bridge Road), Manufacturing Bureau Road (from Xiqiao Road to Longhua Road), Dapu Road (from Xietu Road to Xie Xu Road), and Jumen Road (from Xie Xu Road to Xietu Road). The work has now begun. After the work is completed, not only can the appearance of the city be expected to be tidy, but also the residents along the road, who have suffered from the lack of a total drainage system in the past, can apply to the Engineering Management Office of the Bureau on Zhonghua Road, pay the fees according to the regulations, and connect to the ditch, which will greatly benefit public health.</p>

The competition rules and participation methods were drafted and submitted to the Municipal Education Bureau for approval, and the competition was scheduled to be held on the 14th of this month. Now, many island owners have written to say that the hibiscus is currently in the process of incubating eggs and raising chicks, requesting postponement. After discussion at the park's administrative meeting, it was approved to postpone the event to winter. Yesterday, a notice was sent to all participants, stating: "We hereby inform you that the Second Hibiscus Competition, originally scheduled for April 14th, has been postponed to winter this year due to the majority of bird owners stating that their hibiscus are currently incubating eggs and raising chicks, and requesting postponement.

<p>At noon on the 17th of last month, Xiao Di, the three-year-old son of Zhou Yu, a woman from Jiangbei living in a bungalow on Haizhou Road, was playing near the doorway when he suddenly went missing. Ms. Zhou reported this to the Yangshupu police station, which dispatched detectives to search for him, but without success. Subsequently, detectives Sun Afu and Li Zhenyuan successively apprehended the perpetrators, Meng Ersheng, Jin Shouming, his wife Xia, and Wang Bao (alias Lao Wu) from Anhui, and other persons involved. They were taken to the police station and sent to the First Special District Court for investigation. The other day, Judge Jiang Shuzi visited the Third Criminal Court to conduct a preliminary hearing. Mr. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Municipal Council, stated that in the course of the investigation, it was found that the defendant Meng Ersheng was near the victim's home when he saw Xiao Di playing with his older sister. He then devised a plan to send his older sister away to buy cigarettes. He then lured Xiao Di to Jin and his wife's house for temporary custody. Later, through a middleman, he sold Xiao Di to a Li family on Lloyd Road, agreeing on a price of 30 yuan, which was split and spent. However, the location of the Li family's residence could not be verified. The child has not been heard from to this day. He requested strict punishment. When questioned, the defendants shirked responsibility and gave evasive answers. Judge Jiang ruled that they should be returned to custody separately and that the sentence would be scheduled.</p>

<p>The Guangdong Fellow-Villagers Association in Shanghai held a grand opening ceremony for its membership expansion campaign at the Dadong Restaurant on Nanjing Road at 3 p.m. yesterday.

(4) The Chairman reads the Prime Minister's will. (5) The Chairman delivers the opening speech (Chen Bingqian). (6) Report on the preparations (Tang Haian).

Master of ceremonies: Yang Run.</p>
<p>Opening Speech: After the formal opening, Chairman Chen Bingqian delivered the opening speech, saying: "Today is the opening day of our association's membership expansion campaign, the significance of which is extremely profound and the mission extremely important. I am deeply grateful that my fellow-villagers have taken the trouble to come. I am unworthy, and have been wrongly promoted to be the general captain. I fear that I am unable to shoulder this responsibility, but because of our friendship as fellow-villagers and our affection for our hometown, I can only strive to do my best and live up to your expectations. I believe that it is not accidental that we are all in a foreign land. However, because we are all engaged in our own businesses, our feelings have become estranged. Today, we are fortunate to be attending this grand ceremony. I hope that my fellow-villagers will be determined to trust and believe in each other, and will be eager to love our hometown and our country. We must pledge our full support to this association. How to unite the spirit of our fellow-villagers, how to rescue our fellow-villagers from difficulties, how to protect the legal rights and interests of our fellow-villagers, and how to attempt to promote the production and construction of our fellow-villagers all depend on the collective wisdom and efforts of our fellow-villagers living abroad to achieve success together. All the facilities of this association in the past two years have been based on the premise of uniting fellow-villagers, and all have been based on the interests of fellow-villagers. Furthermore, my fellow-villagers are known to the world for their courage and creativity. Whether it is in Asia, Europe, America, or any other place, there are footprints of people from Guangdong, creating and establishing regulations, forming a grand sight. Shanghai is able to have its prosperity today, and the hard work of my fellow-villagers from Guangdong should not be forgotten. However, in the past, there was a lack of contact, and people acted on their own, with each dividing its own territory and not communicating with each other, forming a heap of loose sand, which was a major obstacle to the development of our careers. But the past is gone, and the future can be pursued. Shanghai is the center of economics and commerce for the whole country, so everything that happens in Shanghai affects the whole country. Therefore, the fellow-villagers in Shanghai must have a great spirit for the responsibilities they bear. Benefiting others is benefiting ourselves, and loving our country begins with loving our hometown. As the saying goes, "It is difficult to clap with one hand, but easy to lift with many hands." I firmly believe that the future of the association, the happiness of our fellow-villagers, and the revival of the country all depend on our efforts today. I hope that my fellow-villagers will unite as one, and then the future of society, the country, and the nation will be greatly benefited."</p>
<p>Mr. Tang's Report: Then, General Staff Tang Haian reported on the preparations, saying: "This association is the largest group of people from Guangdong in Shanghai, and people from the industrial, commercial, political, and academic circles are gathered here, so the responsibilities we bear are extremely important. In the past two years, thanks to the support of our fellow-villagers, the association's work has been thriving, which is gratifying. Now, in order to go a step further and concentrate our efforts, we have specially launched this membership expansion campaign to recruit 100,000 members, hoping to seek rapid progress in the association's work, so that we can organize various welfare and social undertakings. Since the preparations began, Mayor Wu and local people from Guangdong have generously agreed to serve as general captain and general staff, so that this membership expansion campaign has been prepared in a short period of time, and we are very pleased to be able to hold the grand opening ceremony today. The association should cherish the past history and career, and maintain and promote it." Finally, Yang Dezhao, Zheng Zhengqiu, Wen Zongyao, Liu Zhilu, Guo Shun, Yang Meinan, Jian Yujie, and others delivered speeches in succession (the length of the speeches is not recorded).

<h3 id="e158">The Inaugural Meeting of the Gaoqiao Rural Improvement Association <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The Gaoqiao Rural Improvement Association held its inaugural ceremony and its first membership meeting at Gao Xing Zheng Shi Elementary School on the 6th of this month. More than 20 people attended, including President Du, directors, and members of the association, as well as more than 60 guests and 13 representatives of the people from various work areas. After the formal opening, President Du delivered an opening speech, saying that rural work involves a myriad of tasks and cannot be done well in a short period of time, nor can it be achieved by shouting slogans and posting slogans. We must go deep into the people, and do it practically. I serve on the sea, and I am very busy, so I do not have time to take care of the association. I have specially invited Professor Wang of the former Zhijiang University to be responsible for handling the affairs. After half a year of operation, we have already achieved significant results, and we will make even greater progress in the future. Then, Mr. Yu Zhenhui, a representative of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, gave instructions, saying that China's rural areas are bankrupt and need to be improved. The Gaoqiao Rural Improvement Association's improvement of the rural areas of Gaoqiao is not only the dawn of the rural areas near Shanghai, but also the dawn of the rural areas of the whole country. In the shortest half-year, the Gaoqiao Rural Improvement Association has made considerable achievements in popularizing education, building roads, and improving agriculture. If this continues, the people in the Gaoqiao Rural Improvement District will be able to live and work in peace and contentment. I also hope that the rural areas of Shanghai can be like the Gaoqiao Improvement District. Next, General Manager Wang reported on the work of the association's office in the past half year, pointed out the locations of the work areas in the map, and briefly described the situation. He also pointed out the following points: (1) Promote rural handicrafts. (2) Train local youth in the summer, and plan to hold a rural improvement lecture. (3) Popularize education. After the report, the people's representatives from various districts, including Ling Sifei from Xilingjiazhai, Yang Caiqing from Gao Xing Shijiao District, Huang Kongzhao from Xinkang, Xia Xiufeng (a woman) from the Minjiao Training Ground, Guo Yuqing (a youth), and Xu Xiafang (a child), successively reported. Guest Huang Renzhi gave a speech, saying that the rural improvement in the past ten years has made progress in both theory and method. The world is a competitive world. How can China survive? It must rely on the majority of people to resist the enemy. Rural improvement is the starting point for doing this work. There are three recognized sentences for rural improvement: (1) Self-government and governance. (2) Self-sufficiency and supporting others. (3) Self-defense and defending the country. All that is taught, learned, and done is based on this principle, and then China's rural areas will have hope. Finally, I also hope that the people of Gaoqiao will all exert their own strength and not rely on Mr. Du alone. Mr. Du leads the way in the front, and we all follow Mr. Du and run up. Then, President Liu Zhanen of Shanghai University, Director Lu Shuoang of the Shanghai Suburban Agricultural Improvement District of the China Vocational Education Society, and Principal Chen Qun of Zhengshi Middle School gave speeches in succession. Then, General Manager Wang reported on the revenue and expenditure of the past six months, and asked to send personnel to audit the accounts. President Du designated Mr. Zou Bingwen and Mr. Wang Zhixin to audit the accounts. After the photograph was taken at the Zhengshi Elementary School playground, the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Life Bookstore's Special Arrangement for Free Bank Drafts: The Life Bookstore, in view of the difficulties and expenses faced by out-of-town readers in purchasing books and newspapers, has specially concentrated its efforts on handling purchases and subscriptions for all kinds of books and magazines nationwide. It was the earliest to start, and its reputation is most outstanding. Now, to further reduce the burden on readers and strive for convenience and efficiency, it has successively arranged with ten major banks with the widest branch networks nationwide, including "China," "Jiaotong," "Shanghai," "New Mei," "Zhejiang Industrial," "Dalu," "Overseas Chinese," "Juxingcheng," and "Fudian New," to provide free drafts for book purchases, providing meticulous convenience to readers. Moreover, in terms of book prices, except for special-priced pre-orders and other books, all others are offered at a 10% discount from the original publisher's retail price. During this "Reading Movement," the bookstore will also handle the half-price discounted books sold by various bookstores with the same preferential treatment as the original publishers, without adding any handling fees. This saves the time and expense of writing letters and remitting money, effectively making it no different from buying directly from the retail outlets of various original publishers in Shanghai. The bookstore has always strived to bridge cultural gaps, disregarding huge sacrifices, and is set to be a model in the book industry.</p>
<p>Expansion of the Buddhist Bookstore's Retail Department: The Buddhist Bookstore on Jiaozhou Road in this city has seen rapid business growth in recent years.

<h3 id="e170">Feeling After Seeking a Monument <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Zang Kejia</p>
<p>There's a peculiar phenomenon in this place: the hustle and bustle is in the west, while the city walls surround a desolate silence. A few scattered households support themselves on this vast land, like sparse morning stars adorning the blue sky. The ground is littered with broken tiles and shattered bricks, remnants of former halls and chambers. Atop the ground lie earthen mounds, crowding together the masters of those chambers. Such a gloomy ancient city seems only fit for listening to the chirping of ghosts on overcast, rainy days.</p>
<p>"When the long-haired rebels captured the city, no one was left alive, with at least ten thousand men, women, and children dying!"</p>
<p>There are no fewer than fifty mass graves inside and outside the city. If each mound contains two thousand dead, then the so-called "ten thousand" wouldn't be an exaggeration. The largest ones are outside the north gate, with two or three long mounds lined up on each side. Men are on the left, women on the right, as if even in death, the sexes must be kept separate. It seems that there is no impediment to the dead, so they can still look at each other as neighbors. In front of each mound stands a stone tablet, explaining how these dead were tricked by the cunning long-haired rebels, who used a feint to draw them from the surrounding villages into the city and capture them all in one fell swoop. But the brilliance of the inscription lies not in its description of the facts, but in its expressions of opinion. It praises the men for upholding the righteous spirit of heaven and earth, able to risk their lives in danger and die without surrendering; and the women, seeing that the rebels had broken into the city and the situation was dire, for their unwavering determination, preferring death to dishonor, hanging themselves, swallowing gold, jumping into wells, or falling from the city walls, with their deaths being tragic and their chastity worthy of emulation—these sentences should be highlighted. This article was written after the event. The author must have been a renowned scholar, seizing on such a good topic and naturally wanting to showcase his talent under bright windows, clean tables, and the leisurely daylight. As for whether these unfortunate dead, in the face of imminent disaster, with no time to spare for the terror of death and the struggle for life, truly held onto loyalty and chastity in their hearts, it seems quite questionable. When it comes to suicide, it can only be explained as an attempt to avoid the pain of seeking death.</p>
<p>There are plenty of cover-ups in the world, but exposing them seems to spoil the fun. The inscription was not written for the dead, but for the living to see. The phrase "chastity worthy of emulation" makes it clear that the living are being told to learn from the dead. If all the men in the world become loyal and righteous, and all the women can steadfastly maintain their chastity, then the world can naturally enjoy lasting peace and stability, and the emperor will have an empire that lasts for generations. Understanding this, one can naturally understand the reason why "imperial order" monuments are found all over the world.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Recollections of Impressions of Japan <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Guang Huai</p>
<p>It was in the spring of 1930 when a group of us young people were preparing to depart from Shanghai. Everyone was happy—especially myself, being poor and absolutely without the means to study abroad.</p>
<p>Those who travel by ship for the first time always feel a bit uneasy. Fortunately, we were traveling first class, not third class, and there is a clear difference between the two. When the ship arrived in Nagasaki, many Japanese plainclothes detectives rushed into our cabins, looking around as if tigers were searching for people to eat. Luckily, they didn't swallow me whole. This was my first impression of Japan. Later, when my classmates and I were returning home and passing through the Philippines, we were refused permission to land by customs inspectors, and this first impression resurfaced in my mind. After landing, friends took us sightseeing, and unintentionally, a friend pointed out the former Chinese concession, which greatly surprised me. This surprise was unavoidable for someone like me who was still overly enthusiastic and had not yet been cured by correct thinking. However, it later transformed into a driving force that propelled me to explore more deeply. Our tour of Nagasaki was superficial, as we had to catch the train to Tokyo in order to board our original ship to America on time in Yokohama.</p>
<p>My observations in Tokyo and Yokohama were indeed crucial for my intellectual transformation. What we saw in Tokyo (and of course, there were things we didn't see) was indeed beautiful and clean. The streets of Yokohama were also built according to the latest designs. Our guide told us that Yokohama had been reduced to ashes during the previous great earthquake, but in less than five years, the new Yokohama was even more magnificent than the old one. The trains from Tokyo to Yokohama ran extremely punctually, and people boarded without pushing and shoving.</p>
<p>After boarding the original ship from Yokohama, the seas were calm, just like what Su Dongpo described in his "Ode to the Red Cliff": "Drifting on a reed boat, across the vast expanse." With nothing to do on the ship, I began to digest the materials I had observed in Japan. I thought Japan was indeed more advanced than us, with its beautiful Tokyo and Yokohama. But where did this progress come from? During the Sui Dynasty, they sent many people to China to learn applied technologies, such as textiles. During the Tang Dynasty, entire groups of students came to the Chinese capital to study the classics. Even today, the attire of their people still bears the remnants of the Tang Dynasty. Let's not even mention those ancient events. Before the Meiji Restoration, the status of Chinese studies was far above that of Western studies, and China's national power was also greater than Japan's at that time. Why, then, in less than a century, did the historical trajectory completely reverse? I had to find a satisfactory answer to this question, or I wouldn't be at peace.</p>
<p>Naturally, one adopts the method they are most familiar with to solve problems. At that time, I was an idealist and had read a book about Japan written by an idealist who was also an expert on Japan. I thought that all of Japan's modern progress was due to what was called the Yamato national character. But aren't the Japanese all short and nimble, mostly with a bit of the samurai spirit, and willing to take risks? However, such an answer was too simplistic for me. I thought again: agility, willingness to take risks, and the samurai spirit are not necessarily unique to the Japanese. It is true that the Ming Dynasty pirates colluded with Japanese pirates and constantly harassed the coastal provinces of China, but in the early Ming Dynasty, Chinese pirates also adventured southward to harass Southeast Asia, ruling over some of its tribes and establishing commercial relations between China and Southeast Asia. It is true that Japan has Bushido, but hasn't China had chivalrous heroes throughout its history? Moreover, we have many facts that can show that Japanese samurai in many ways directly imitated Chinese knights. It is true that Japan has the commendable military achievements of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, but compared with the military achievements of China's prosperous dynasties, it is only insignificant.</p>
<p>If we say that the advantages of the so-called Yamato national character are biological advantages, if we say that the Yamato people have physiological structures that are better than ours, then we would ask: why did they still have to come to China to learn the most basic life skills during the Sui and Tang dynasties? Why, just over a hundred years ago, did they still worship China and view China as superior to itself?</p>
<p>As far as the knowledge revealed to us by biology is concerned, changes in biological structures are gradual and require a long period of time. Human beings who have not yet broken away from the animal state did not know how much time it took to abandon their quadrupedal behavior. The two front feet became two hands that were freed from walking. The increase in brain weight is also the result of long-term engagement in mental labor. Although we can sometimes find mutation phenomena in the biological world, it is a qualitative change formed by the accumulation of many quantitative changes and is also limited by time. The Japanese of today are certainly not more biologically superior to their ancestors in the Sui and Tang dynasties, or their close ancestors a hundred years ago, because no magic can transform the physiological structure of the Yamato people in such a short period. It can be seen that it is utterly untenable for idealists to explain Japan's progress based on the so-called advantages of the national character.</p>
<p>The more I reasoned, the more I ran into a dead end. Finally, I abandoned the idealist standpoint and adopted a materialist standpoint to think. But the materialism I knew at that time was limited to the geographical determinism proposed by Liang Shuming in his "Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies," which is a branch of mechanical materialism. Following Brooke's suggestion, I thought that Japan's progress came from its superior geographical situation—from its good harbors, from the barren geology that forced the people to work hard. But this explanation still left a big loophole. The changes in terrain and geology are also gradual over a long period of time. If the geology and terrain of Japan in the Sui and Tang dynasties could differ from the present so much as to produce different cultures and civilizations, we cannot say that the geographical conditions in the less than a century from the Meiji Restoration to the present could have changed to the point where the Japan before and after are like two different countries. A major earthquake can cause several islands to completely sink and several islands to float from the mountains and seas, or a sudden climate change can give birth to or destroy some of the animals and plants on which humans depend for survival, thereby changing the entire lifestyle of the residents, but Japan has not experienced such shocks and historical changes in the past hundred years. If geographical changes can explain Japan's progress, then why has China been struggling in the transition between the old and the new during the same period, even though China's geographical environment has not been without changes? If we say that Japan's geographical changes are towards the superior side, then since they are both geographical changes, why does China's trend towards the inferior side?</p>
<p>The materialism I understood at the time was just a very vague environmental determinism. I used it to explain Japan's progress, but this explanation could not satisfy me because it left several questions that could not be answered in this way. When I studied further, I realized how to fill the loopholes in my previous thinking. It turns out that humans who have not broken away from the animal state are, like animals, subject to the environment. They can only adapt to the external nature, and their lives are completely determined by the external natural environment. But when human history began, that is, when humans could manufacture and use labor tools, they broke away from the animal state. They were still affected by the external natural environment, but they could use their own invented, manufactured, and used labor tools to control the external nature. They can ask the external nature to adapt to themselves to varying degrees, and this degree depends on the level of social labor technology—that is, the level of labor tool system. The reason why Japan a hundred years ago was so different from Japan today is none other than the role of machinery and science there.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, we cannot help but sweat for the present China, which is blinded by anti-science and machine awareness!</p>
<h3 id="e172">新加拉惹輪中 <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>We paused for one night at the customhouse of the Lu River. The next day, a K.P.M. company steamer was fully loaded with cargo, and in the evening, it set sail on a ship called "Singaradja."</p>
<p>A steamer traveling twelve miles per hour felt very slow to the passengers. Moreover, the Lu River kept making turns, constantly curbing the desire to see the sea again. Having been confined to the lonely K. area for three years, shaking hands with a giant of modern civilization—a ship—brought unspeakable joy. Furthermore, a pair of eyes that were once sharp, dulled by the dim kerosene lamps inside the low huts, were suddenly exposed to the bright electric lights of the ship, feeling as if one had leaped from the eighteenth or nineteenth century to the twentieth century, experiencing novelty and delight.</p>
<p>But as soon as the ship reached the Lerong fishing area, the Lu River was swallowed by the sea, and darkness shrouded the earth. The "sea love" that was felt from the coast of Singapore and the coast of Tanjung Bungah (Penang) could no longer be savored, truly a "lasting disappointment!"</p>
<p>Beyond the small circle of electric light, the sea was all darkness. The stars twinkled in the high sky, offering no power to the light. Few passengers were on board, and even fewer were awake, so the loneliness deepened. Only the roar of the machinery pierced the eardrums, a force of relentless propulsion that commanded admiration!</p>
<p>Suddenly, a Dutch teenager on deck began to sing loudly and play an instrument. Just as I wanted to receive beautiful melodies from the vast sea, the singing and music stopped, followed by dancing. A Dutch young woman, like a newlywed on her honeymoon, whispered in the Dutch teenager's ear, and the lonely dance stopped abruptly.</p>
<p>The power of the environment brought complete silence to the ship.</p>
<p>While Mr. Lin and I were preparing our bedding, a middle-aged man with a dark brown face suddenly emerged. He used a friendly and approachable attitude, constantly chatting with us in a low voice. Mr. Lin used a sophisticated tone to deal with him. Eventually, I realized that this gentlemanly and "boss"-like middle-aged man was actually trying to proselytize. Mr. Lin continued to placate him, but I tilted my ear to listen to the majestic roar of the sea.</p>
<p>The preacher walked away seemingly empty-handed, and an unbridled wild horse began to gallop in my heart: young people who had lost their lives and happiness from fervent beliefs over the years flashed through my mind one by one. A wave of manic feeling passed through my nerves, and I thought "God" should just be kicked into the sea.</p>
<p>Mr. Lin, covered in a red blanket, was planning his affairs, but I was thinking of "Bomb" (a friend) lying dying in the Asahan hospital. The sea beat against the iron plates of the ship's hull, and my heart was gnawed by the world's faiths.</p>
<p>The bow of the ship was illuminated by a dim light, and I thought faith should only listen to the light indicated by the ship's bow. At sea, life is exceptionally obscure; even breathing can be swallowed by deathly silence. Let the ship's rudder guide me to my destination!</p>
<p>The preacher's face and his mellifluous words completely slipped out of my comforted mind, and the night ship surged forward in the dark sea, surging forward.</p>
<h3 id="e173">峇魯村的早晨 <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— 雷鐵鳴</p>
<p>Baru Village was quiet, hidden in the gray fog…</p>
<p>The horizon was already shimmering with the color of dawn, with clusters of pale white clouds moving across the hazy sky. In the lonely and vast mountains and fields, a slight morning breeze blew gently, bringing a hint of tropical coolness.</p>
<p>In the coconut groves and banyan trees, birds began to chirp and sing happily, hopping about. Wild insects in the grass also hissed and buzzed softly, wriggling.</p>
<p>"Cock-a-doodle-doo…"</p>
<p>The rooster's crow, like a joyful cry, sharply pierced the silence of the morning. Gradually, Baru Village heard the sounds of children crying, women talking, old people coughing, and faint footsteps…</p>
<p>On the mist-shrouded riverbank, the sparse shadows of fishermen moved about. Before the sun rose, they had to rush to the mouth of the sea. One by one, the fishing boats rowed toward the winding river surface, carrying the sound of *squish squish* of the oars.</p>
<p>"Woo!——"</p>
<p>The factory siren on the Mount of Petroleum howled, and its terrifying echo, like a lion's roar, awakened the entire sleeping Baru Village.</p>
<p>"Ding-dong! Ding-dong!…" Then, the large bronze bell in the bell tower on the high slope of Baru Village also rang.</p>
<p>"Sima, get up! The siren has already sounded!"</p>
<p>"Aaron! Do you hear the bell ringing?"</p>
<p>The women were nudging their husbands, calling out urgently. The men, having just recovered from their fatigue, opened their bloodshot, sleepy eyes and hurriedly climbed out of bed.</p>
<p>At this time, all the men, women, children, and old people in the village got up; they mechanically went through the motions, some brewing coffee and tea for their husbands, some busy tidying up fruit stalls, some grinding axes with a rustling sound, and some scolding their children, while others went naked to the well to take a cold shower.</p>
<p>In this Baru Village, filled with noise and vitality, the people heard the long wail of the mountain siren for the second time.</p>
<p>The sky was filled with cotton-like white clouds, and a faint red shadow of the sun was already glimmering in the eastern corner. The hazy mist had completely dissipated, and the surroundings were filled with clear, warm air!</p>
<p>On the flat stone bridge and the rugged pebble road, the number of pedestrians gradually increased, one, two, three; in this crowd there were strong workers, agile women, lively children, sturdy old men, peddlers carrying baskets, woodcutters carrying ropes and axes, road workers carrying shovels…</p>
<p>"Garsin, good morning!"</p>
<p>"Oh, it's you! Alie Napea."</p>
<p>"Liya, has Garzang's illness gotten better yet? Too many chilies!"</p>
<p>Whether men, women, old or young, they greeted each other, their faces showing warm and sincere smiles, as if they had forgotten their fatigue and toil. Walking, they left Baru Village behind, each heading toward their own factories, deep mountains, forests, markets, vegetable patches…</p>
<p>The sun, like a piece of burning charcoal, rose and kissed the floating red clouds passionately, and the beautiful golden light shone all over the distant and nearby coconut groves, rooftops, fields, streams, and the entire Baru Village.</p>
<p>"Woo woo——"</p>
<p>Thick black smoke was already billowing from the oil derricks on the Mount of Petroleum; and the crowd trudging forward on the pebble road also gradually disappeared in the blood-red sunlight.</p>
<p>The morning sun peeked out from the treetops, and the warm light slowly became scorching. From the rooftops of the "attap houses" in Baru Village, sparse wisps of smoke floated lightly; the women were busy cooking, washing clothes, and gathering firewood; a frail old man sat under the bamboo fence feeding chickens, and several unweaned children were singing mountain songs; there were a few dogs wandering around in the coconut grove; and a flock of ducks floated on the stream…</p>
<p>The Malay village of Baru, at this moment, returned to the same silence as in the middle of the night.</p>
<h3 id="e174">巨卿先生（九） <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— 柯靈</p>
<p>"In these times, it's really impossible for us small businesses to say anything. They, the big shots, love to quarrel, and the unlucky ones are the bystanders. I'm like a mute eating bitter herbs, who am I going to appeal to, to that great and impartial sky? Luckily, there are many empty houses on the street now. The classrooms in the school, no matter how precious they are, I won't rent them anymore. It's hard to do business these days. If it weren't for my big and small children needing to eat, I really wouldn't open this kind of lousy store."</p>
<p>He paused for a moment.</p>
<p>"Because of this matter, the school still hasn't started classes. The students are all wandering around like wild ghosts all day long. I really don't know when it will end. We, the little ones, have decided not to let him go back to school anymore. That's why I came to discuss it with you, sir, and ask you to take him in."</p>
<p>Mr. Juqing's heart began to pound rapidly, but he tried hard to maintain his composure. He agreed to Mr. Fu Dianwang's request, wrinkling his brow and saying:</p>
<p>"Running a school in the first place is just a joke. The children don't study all day long, they just focus on doing gymnastics and singing folk songs. What kind of behavior is that! Now it's even more of a mess."</p>
<p>That night, when Mr. Juqing returned home, he was so happy that a long-unseen smile spread across his face.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of this opportunity, Mr. Juqing also approached several other places. And he ran out every day to inquire whether the storm at the district-run elementary school had spread further.</p>
<p>When people in power fight, there is usually a third party in power who comes out to "mediate." This storm lasted for seven or eight days, and finally subsided. When Principal Zhang Shaoxiong announced to the students that classes would resume immediately, the number of students listening had decreased by almost half. At the same time, the several private schools in the town all seemed like dying lamps that had been refueled, showing a little bit of life.</p>
<p>The most successful one was Mr. Juqing. The result of this storm was that he gained six or seven more students. Everyone read aloud with drawn-out voices, and the sound of reading was actually a bit noisy.</p>
<p>In early February, the eaves and corners of the houses were filled with dreamlike east winds.</p>
<p>Following the warming weather, Mr. Juqing's heart seemed to have a bit of a "spring revival" too. Compared to before, although the current situation still had many shortcomings, he already felt content.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Manifesto of the Reading Movement Conference <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Any nation that can soar in the world has two wings: one is superior spiritual power, and the other is superior material power. The so-called spiritual power is intelligence, while material power includes physical strength, wealth, and material resources as major elements. Current collectivists tend to emphasize material power while neglecting spiritual power, which is a big mistake. Because if there is no spiritual power to dominate, then even if there is strong physical strength, abundant wealth, and numerous material resources, they will fall into a state of no control, no organization, and no management. Once you want to use them on a large-scale nation, you will find that this material power is just a pile of loose sand, not a united and solidified cement, and you can only let others defeat them one by one.</p>
<p>The only way to increase spiritual power is to seek knowledge, and to seek knowledge, you must read. Books are the sum of inherent culture. We can achieve the effect of reviewing the old and knowing the new by reading books. Books are the crystallization of Western culture. We can get a ladder to catch up by reading books. The reason why our nation cannot soar in the world, and even its survival is greatly threatened, is largely due to not reading books and not seeking knowledge. Not reading books and not seeking knowledge means that the light of wisdom cannot illuminate the dangers around us, and the power of the spirit cannot control our own material resources, so it is no wonder that China will become a neo-colony of foreign countries. Now we invite everyone to participate in the reading movement. Its greatest purpose is to hope that everyone can prepare more useful knowledge to control, organize, and manage their own material power, and to fight for the survival of our nation.</p>
<p>Some people think that what the country and the nation need now are airplanes, battleships, cannons, and bombs, not books that are not worth a penny. In fact, airplanes, battleships, cannons, and bombs are certainly useful, but the knowledge of manufacturing and using these airplanes, battleships, cannons, and bombs is even more useful. If there is no knowledge to manufacture airplanes, battleships, cannons, and bombs, how can airplanes, battleships, cannons, and bombs be produced? If there is no knowledge to use airplanes, battleships, cannons, and bombs, then even if there are airplanes, battleships, cannons, and bombs, what is the use? From this, can we not see that intellectual power, which belongs to the spirit, is more important than physical strength, wealth, and material resources, which belong to matter?</p>
<p>Didn't the French say that their recovery of Alsace-Lorraine was the power of elementary school teachers? The textbooks in the hands of elementary school teachers can be used as magic weapons to recover lost territories, so wouldn't books other than elementary school textbooks have even greater effects? Then why don't we also hurry up and read books to seek knowledge?</p>
<p>Dear compatriots, please move the time spent on nothing to reading books, and move the money spent on useless things to buying books. We must know that organizing a country with a majority of uneducated people is more dangerous than using rotten ropes to drive six horses. Now uneducated people are all over the country, what do we rely on to fight for the survival of the nation?</p>
<p>We dare to assert that whether it is to enrich the lives of the people, to develop the national economy independently, or to fight for the survival of the nation, it is closely related to the rise and fall of learning, and the rise and fall of learning is linked to whether people are willing to read books and seek knowledge, so reading is what China needs at this time and in this place.</p>

<p>— 樊仲雲</p>
<p>"How to Read" is the most common topic, just like "How to Eat." Everyone who reads probably knows it. For example, eye-to-eye, mouth-to-mouth, heart-to-heart, and hand-to-hand are all old sayings that don't need to be repeated. Even how to write notes, how to add lines and marks, etc., are all well-known. Therefore, I will just write about my personal reading experience here.</p>
<p>I am ashamed to say that I have never systematically read any books. Half of the reason is that I had to work for a living when I was still studying, and I didn't have a whole period of time; half of the reason is that I didn't have the spirit of hard research like the ancients. My reading is mostly based on my own temporary interest, or initiated by the introduction of friends. Therefore, I usually just browse ordinary books and leave it at that. Only if I find that a book is worth rereading after browsing it, I will not only select the main points of each paragraph and add money, circles, or dots, but also take notes of the main points of each paragraph on the book. Because taking the main points of each paragraph forces me to have careful thoughts about the books I read. Through such repeated thinking, after reading the whole book, I have a considerable concept of the general content. When I write an article and need to refer to it, I open the book I have read, and by looking at the main points I have taken on the eyebrows, I can easily find the material I need. I think this method seems better than writing notes, because it saves time. Of course, this is just my personal opinion. If there is more time, then putting in more effort is always more beneficial than being lazy.</p>
<p>My reading method is to make circles and marks on the book, and then add marginal notes and extract the main points. Therefore, when I encounter books borrowed from others or from the library, I feel that it is impossible to do so. So, even though I have read the book, I often have to buy a copy myself in order to extract the main points. However, because I have already read it, the work of marking it is often put aside. Because I have not read this book carefully, and after a while, when I reread it, I often find it very unfamiliar, as if I have never read it before. This makes me feel that it is not enough to just read a book. After reading it, there must be thinking and note-taking, so that the content of the book can be used by me. In other words, this is still the old method of eye-to-eye, heart-to-heart, and hand-to-hand, but I have come to know this old method through my own experience.</p>
<p>Another experience is that I think that when reading history and geography, and even when reading newspapers and magazines, it is best to have a map at the same time. Often, with the help of maps, I can understand and remember facts more easily. Especially when reading history, it takes a lot of effort to remember ancient place names. If you can compare the present with the past with a map, it is very easy to remember.</p>
<p>Also, because I work in a bookstore, I can often go to the library to browse the books I want to read. Naturally, I have read a lot, but it has made me realize the vastness of the sea of learning. There are many books that I have only browsed through the table of contents and the preface, but I have still gotten a general idea of them. Therefore, I feel that the opportunity to read is also very important for young people. Now, libraries no longer have the freedom of entry and exit as they used to, but in order to expand my understanding of pictures, I have to go to Chinese and foreign bookstores to browse books, which has become a kind of pastime like watching movies. Sometimes, when I encounter a good book, I will buy it back, considering my finances. However, when my pockets are empty, even if there is a book, I have to leave reluctantly, and it is really uncomfortable at that time.</p>
<p>As for reading foreign languages, my experience is probably like this: because I learned English and Japanese on my own, and my purpose at the time was to read books, I didn't care much about the pronunciation, and I didn't even care about writing. My intention was only to understand the true meaning of the sentences. But to understand the true meaning, it is not enough to just know the new words and explain the sentences. So, I used this to practice my translation, which allowed me to think and savor each word and sentence carefully. What I read was mostly literary works in English with Japanese translations and notes. Therefore, I had to explain English with Japanese, and understand Japanese with English, and compare and contrast them from both sides to recognize their meaning. I would like to use this method to learn German on my own, but after the age of thirty, although I can find time, the spirit of reading that I had when I was young has greatly diminished. As a result, I still cannot get into the door of German. From this, we can know that in addition to "how to read", you also need to have the spirit of reading.</p>
<h3 id="e178">怎樣研究哲學 <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— 葉靑</p>
<p>The special issue of the Reading Movement asks me to write a short article on the study of philosophy. I have always advocated research, especially the study of philosophy. But I have never written about this topic before. So, I might as well take this opportunity to provide some methodological advice to those who study philosophy.</p>
<p>I think the phrase "studying philosophy" contains two meanings. One is to understand existing philosophy, and the other is to establish a new philosophy. The former is preparatory work, and the latter is pioneering work. Strictly speaking, only the latter is worthy of being called "studying philosophy", while the former is just learning philosophy or acquiring philosophical knowledge.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the study of philosophy, I will also divide it into two to discuss, starting with the first one.</p>
<p>(1) Read an introduction to philosophy. This is necessary. Otherwise, you won't even know what philosophy is. An introduction to philosophy tells you general philosophical knowledge. So, you should understand this first.</p>
<p>(2) Read the history of philosophy. Philosophy is divided into schools, and it is also divided into families. Those who study philosophy cannot be ignorant of the doctrines of the various schools and families in the past. How can it be said that the essence of philosophy is the theory of this school and that school, this family and that family, and there is no common and definite content at all?</p>
<p>(3) Philosophy. Choose a school or family of philosophy that you think is correct from the history of philosophy to discuss. Collect as many philosophical books of that school or family as possible. You must understand its origin, development, and demise, so that you can master the words of one family.</p>
<p>(4) What is correct philosophy? I think it is the philosophy that is consistent with science. What is the philosophy that is consistent with science? In the first part II of my book "Critique of Zhang Rongsun's Philosophy" (published by Xin Ken Bookstore), there is a clear and detailed explanation, which I don't have the space to mention here.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the second method of research.</p>
<p>(1) To create a philosophy, you must first pay attention to the historical development of philosophy. A family of philosophy is a set of logic, a school of philosophy is a set of logic, and a history of philosophy is also a set of logic. And creating a philosophy is the unfolding of the logic of the history of philosophy. Then, how can you unfold its logic if you don't understand the development of philosophy?</p>
<p>(2) In fact, this is just telling us where to put our efforts. How to unfold logic? I think you can only read the history of philosophy carefully and do deep thinking. So, the method is nothing else, here it is nothing more than these three: first, think; second, think; third, think.</p>
<p>(3) What kind of thinking? I think you need to have a holistic, historical, and logical view of the development of philosophy. In the beginning, you need to start with one era at a time. The method is to grasp the characteristics of each era. And in the meantime, you must always pay attention to the overall thread. You must do this in order to understand what problems need to be solved when this set of logic comes to our modern times.</p>
<p>(4) How to solve it? Appeal to science. Even if you have obtained a solution to the problem from thinking, you must also seek evidence from science. Today, you cannot have philosophical theory without leaving science. The era of purely thinking and establishing a philosophical era from philosophical thinking is over.</p>
<p>(5) What science? In terms of cosmology and cosmology, it is natural science; in terms of life theory, it is social science. And in the former, physics and biology are the most important, and in the latter, economics and sociology are the most important. This naturally does not mean that other subjects do not need attention. Philosophy should use science as the material to build it.</p>
<p>(6) How to study science? Not the research of scientists, that is, technical research, but should take the approach of philosophers. In other words, it is to conduct purely theoretical exploration of science. Therefore, you should pay special attention to scientific discoveries with theoretical significance, such as the atomic theory, electron theory, quantum theory, theory of relativity, theory of evolution, etc.</p>
<p>(7) Moreover, I think that philosophy today is fundamentally unified with science, that is, the form of general theory or conclusion of science from the descriptive stage, the explanatory stage, to the highest theoretical stage. The philosophy of philosophy has disappeared, and there is only the philosophy of science (see my book "Where is Philosophy Going?" also published by Xin Ken Bookstore). Studying philosophy is to recognize it, elucidate it, and develop it.</p>
<p>The above two methods are both special methods, which are the same as studying general knowledge subjects. This is described in detail in my article "How to Study Theory". That article is in the second issue of the second volume of the twentieth century, which is sold by Xin Ken Bookstore, so I won't repeat it here.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to declare that because of the limited space, I cannot say everything, and at the same time there are things that I don't fully mean. I will discuss the method of philosophy in another article later. But it can be asserted that these short words can be used as a reference for people.</p>
<h3 id="e179">My Reading Experience <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Cai Yuanpei</p>
<p>I began reading when I was just over ten years old; now, nearly sixty years have passed. Except for major illnesses or other special reasons, there has hardly been a day when I haven't read something. Yet, I have not achieved much, and this is because my reading methods were flawed. I will write down a rough outline of my ineffective methods, which can serve as a warning to others.</p>
<p>My first shortcoming was the inability to focus. When I first started reading, I read mostly old books, primarily those dealing with textual research and literary composition. My preferences in textual research leaned towards exegesis and philosophical principles, while I lacked patience for institutions and nomenclature. In literary composition, I favored prose and was not particularly keen on parallel prose or poetry. However, I was ashamed to be ignorant of anything, so I read everything. I even studied mathematics and medicine books, but I never mastered any of them. I once intended to compile a "Phonetic and Semantic Exegesis of the Shuowen Jiezi," and also a "Grand Interpretation of the Gongyang Commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals," but neither came to fruition. As for my literary works, not only was there not a single piece of parallel prose or poetry worth preserving, but even my prose was too commonplace. After the age of forty, I began learning German, and later French, but I never diligently memorized vocabulary or practiced grammar. Instead, I just devoured books, so I still cannot write a passable essay or give a short speech. After entering university in Germany and attending lectures, I listened to everything: history of philosophy, history of literature, history of civilization, psychology, aesthetics, history of art, and ethnology. At that time, I also began to read a mishmash of reference books related to these subjects. Later, I勉forced myself to narrow my focus, concentrating mainly on aesthetics and art history, supplemented by ethnology. However, I could never bring myself to give up other types of books entirely. Therefore, I wanted to translate a book on aesthetics and compile a comparative ethnology, but neither came to fruition.</p>
<p>My second shortcoming was the inability to take notes diligently. My reading was driven by a kind of egoism, I didn't bother to seek out the shortcomings in the books I read. I focused on what I found useful or appealing. This in itself wasn't necessarily bad, but my flaw was that, while I paid attention to these points while reading, I often didn't take the time to jot them down or make special notes in the book in the interest of speed reading. If I later wanted to recall something, except for German books with detailed indexes, it was almost impossible to find in the other books. Although there are now people in China who compile "indexes" and specialized dictionaries, which are gradually increasing, making it easier to search, everyone has their own focus, and ordinary indexes cannot be as convenient as one's own notes. I once saw Mr. Hu Shih, during a certain period, often carrying one or two thread-bound books when going out, leafing through them on trains or in other moments of leisure, and marking useful material by folding the corner or making a note in pencil. I imagine that he would then make a copy when he returned home. I remember a notebook saying that Wang Yuyang, when reading, would write down new and brilliant allusions or phrases on paper strips and stick them on the walls of his study, reading them frequently, and then removing them when he was familiar with them, replacing them with new ones. That is why he remembered so much. Although this is a literary trick, why couldn't it be imitated in science? Because I have always been too lazy to write, I have not achieved anything.</p>
<p>I have experienced many inconveniences from my reading shortcomings and have written them down specifically, hoping that readers will learn from my mistakes. First, be able to focus; second, be able to take notes. This will surely bring many benefits.</p>
<h3 id="e180">How to Study Economics <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Bai</p>
<p>1. Why Study Economics?</p>
<p>In the realm of social sciences, the term "economics" occupies an extremely important position. In primitive societies, uncivilized peoples, whether they engage in fishing, hunting, or animal husbandry, all demonstrate a pursuit of material goods to satisfy their material needs. In modern society, where the material lives of individuals and families are consistently improving, the relationship with economics becomes even more intimate. In modern nations, all legislative and administrative actions cannot be separated from an economic backdrop. In recent international affairs, discussions of relationships and cooperation must take economics as a prerequisite. Thus, economics is not only a subject that specialized scholars must study in detail, but also one that the general public should understand in outline to adapt to modern society.</p>
<p>2. Materials for Studying Economics</p>
<p>The materials for studying economics are complex, but if scientific methods are used to synthesize them, they can be categorized into the following. Beginners in economics should classify and categorize them, studying them in sequence, from the simple to the complex, and it will be easy to grasp their essence. Once you have a path for research and a considerable understanding of economic science, you can also find a system within the following categories that suits your interests and conduct further research. This is also acceptable.</p>
<p>(3) Studying from the perspective of economic policy: Economic policy is the expression of economic thinkers and the method of economic scholars' research results, which governments of various countries now adopt as mutual assistance or antagonistic means. Economic policies can be further divided into monetary policy, tariff policy, international trade policy, and so on. However, the main driving forces behind them are no more than the following three: (1) Free trade policy; (2) Protective tariff policy; (3) Neo-mercantilist policy.</p>
<p>(4) Studying from the perspective of economic problems: Economic problems can be international or domestic. When you reach this point in your studies, you will have a considerable understanding of economic principles, economic thought, and economic policy. For example, take the recent silver problem; this problem involves a part of monetary theory in economic principles, and both exchange and distribution must be discussed; it also involves a part of international trade policy, and the economic conditions of various countries must also be understood. To understand the matter thoroughly or to find a result, it is certainly not something that a beginner in economics can accomplish. In addition to this, there are many economic topics, such as tariff issues, the American gold bill issue, the maintenance of the gold standard by European countries such as France, Belgium, and Italy, and the problem of inflation in China. Depending on the scholar's interests, they can all be studied to solve domestic and international economic panic and seek an effective rescue strategy.</p>
<p>4. Methods of Studying Economics:</p>
<p>(1) Studying from the perspective of economic principles: Economic principles focus on explaining or arguing whether principles are appropriate; they include four major parts: production theory, exchange theory, distribution theory, and consumption theory. Any economic phenomenon in modern society is within these four parts; if it does not fall into one, it falls into another. Beginners in economics should first understand these principles; those who study economic theory must pursue these principles.</p>
<p>(2) Studying from the perspective of economic thought: Economic thought is the source of the entire field of economics. Some are fragmented economic views. However, these fragmented ideas are often systematic, organized, and promoted into great economic theories. Some include the entire aspect of economics. Although economic thought is not entirely economic theory, it is the existence of economic thought that leads to the current economic organization. To understand the economic phenomena in Europe since the 16th century, there are two major trends: liberalism and nationalism. The former believes that the economy is driven by individual initiative and that the state should not interfere with its development; therefore, some call it individualism. The latter believes that social wealth should be controlled by state power, and individual freedom of action is reduced to zero, whether in production, exchange, distribution, or consumption. Therefore, some call it interventionism. What is now called socialism is also included. A table is listed below to facilitate browsing and research:</p>
<p>Now that the materials for economics are known to be observed separately, one must also have a method to study them in order to understand them thoroughly and achieve complete results. The methods that the ancients used to study are introduced below.</p>
<p>(1) Analytical method or deductive method: Classical economists used this method to study economics. Some start from psychology and deduce various economic laws from individual desires and needs, forming the psychological school of economists today. Some use mathematical or algebraic methods to deduce, so they are also called the mathematical school of economists.</p>
<p>(2) Method of factual observation: Economists who use this method focus on the evolution of facts and ignore abstract analysis, which is the opposite of classical economists. This can be further divided into three groups:</p>
<p>A. Direct observation method—French Leplay school;</p>
<p>B. Historical research method—German Hiletant Koscher Sctomlier;</p>
<p>C. Economic observation method—Most modern legislators belong to this category.</p>
<p>Since the research methods of the ancients are such, which one should we adopt? The former emphasizes analysis, so it inevitably overlooks the changes in human life and the motivation of human needs for material goods. The latter only pays attention to facts, which may be too biased and lack objectivity. If we want to study, we should choose the strengths of both and use both methods; first observe economic phenomena, then examine historical facts, and then use deductive methods to analyze. In this way, it will not be difficult to solve any economic material.</p>
<p>(5) The objects and hopes of studying economics:</p>
<p>The various economic objects of production, exchange, distribution, and consumption are nothing more than individuals, society, the state, and the international community. After our research, we should at least have some hopes. As for individuals, they should be thrifty in order to increase production with savings obtained from their labor. If everyone does this, the social wealth can also increase. As for society, both labor and capital should help each other so that social productivity will not be reduced due to conflicts, and everyone's material life will gradually improve. As for the country, the government should adopt interventionism and implement controlled economy, so that the country's wealth production and wealth distribution will have an overall plan, so as not to ignore one thing and lose another, causing social disturbances or the aggression of great powers. As for the international community, only by implementing economic cooperation and economic advancement can world struggle be eliminated, and human happiness can be truly improved. Otherwise, if one country is rich and another is poor, or if the material development of the east neighbors and the material deficiencies of the west neighbors, such a畸形abnormal phenomenon is only the misfortune of mankind.</p>
<h3 id="e181">How to Study History <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— He Bingsong</p>
<p>This topic is very broad and cannot be covered in a few words. Now, I can only offer a few humble opinions on the purpose and attitude of reading history for readers to consider.</p>
<p>History is a record of human past events, similar to our personal memories. Personal experience relies on memory to guide us on our path forward; human past events rely on records to guide our direction. At the same time, reading history not only allows us to understand the different characteristics and trends of Chinese and foreign cultures but also allows us to understand that Chinese and foreign cultures are constantly changing, which is enough to increase our courage to move forward.</p>
<p>Another point is that all modern scholars, whether they are writers or chemists, must have a "historical attitude." The so-called historical attitude is to "thoroughly investigate the origins" of everything. Only when the origins are understood can we see the whole picture of the matter. For example, when治理 governing a river, we must start by surveying the upstream. If we only work on the downstream, we will not get any results. The same is true if we want to understand the content and value of all human affairs in society. Relying solely on the present without tracing the origins will lead to the arbitrary knowledge of two-fifths while ignorant of one-tenth, which is not enough. This attitude is the most important attitude in modern scholarship, and it can only be cultivated by reading history.</p>
<p>Studying history is like studying other sciences. We need to be both broad and deep. Being broad expands our understanding of human past events, and being deep concentrates our attention on a certain era, region, or aspect of history. Breadth leads to greatness, and depth leads to profundity. In general, we should focus on breadth when reading history and strive for depth when we have the capacity. Breadth is the cultivation of common sense, and depth is specialized research. When studying any academic field, it is always advisable to first have a wealth of common sense before becoming a specialized expert.</p>
<p>Studying history also has a secondary benefit: eliminating prejudices. Therefore, modern scientific historians can always strive to eliminate their own prejudices. Because writing history with prejudices easily reverses right and wrong, reversing the order of importance. This loses the calm, impartial attitude of modern scientists. Historical works that first establish a proposition and then gather historical facts to prove that proposition can also be regarded as works that promote personal propositions. We should not have prejudices when writing history ourselves, and we must first see if the author has prejudices when reading other people's works.</p>
<p>We are all Chinese and should know something about Chinese history. We are also modern people and should also read some foreign history. Reading Chinese history allows us to understand the reasons why the oldest and largest civilization in the world has been preserved. Reading foreign history allows us to understand why our own ancient civilization is now being oppressed by foreign countries. At the same time, reading Chinese history can make us understand what our culture is and how to transform it to suit modern needs. Reading foreign history can make us understand what Western culture is and how to introduce it to China and make it Chinese, so that it suits China's needs.</p>
<p>In short, all modern Chinese youth should read some Chinese and foreign history to increase essential common sense, cultivate a "historical attitude," deeply understand the similarities and differences between Chinese and foreign cultures, and the path to the revival of national culture, and be determined to be a healthy member who creates a Chinese-based culture.</p>

<h3 id="e182">Ministry of Education Revises and Promulgates Two Regulations for Graduation Examinations for Middle School and Normal School Students <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education will revise the regulations for graduation examinations for middle school students and normal school students and issue orders to the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities. The orders were seen in yesterday's newspaper. The two regulations are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Revised Regulations for Graduation Examinations for Middle School Students</p>
<p>Article 1 The educational administrative agencies of each province, city, and district shall, for the graduating students of the middle schools under their jurisdiction, after the original school's examination of their graduation grades and determination of their eligibility, hold graduation examinations.</p>
<p>Article 2 The graduation examinations for public and established private middle schools in provinces, counties, and cities shall be handled by a committee organized by the educational administrative agencies of the respective provinces.</p>
<p>The graduation examinations for public (excluding those established by the province) and established private middle schools in cities (municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan) and districts (special administrative regions) shall be handled by a committee organized by the educational administrative agencies of the respective cities and districts. Article 3 The regulations for the graduation examination committee for middle school students shall be separately determined by the Ministry's order.</p>
<p>Article 4 The subjects for the examination are tentatively set as follows:</p>
<p>1. Senior High School: Civics, Chinese, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, History, Geography, Foreign Language.</p>
<p>2. Junior High School: Civics, Chinese, Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry, Biology (Zoology and Botany), History and Geography, Foreign Language.</p>
<p>Article 5 The semester examinations for the second semester of the third year for the graduating students of the schools participating in the examination should be held within two weeks before the date of the examination.</p>
<p>Article 6 One month before the examination, each school shall submit a roster with photos of graduating students to the competent educational administrative agency, and the graduation grade reports for each subject shall also be submitted before the start of the examination.</p>
<p>Article 7 The method for calculating the grades for each subject in the graduation examination should be based on the school's graduation grades for each subject (i.e., the average of the grades for the three years) accounting for 40% and the examination grades for each subject accounting for 60%, which are combined for calculation.</p>
<p>The grades mentioned above should be calculated using the percentage method, and 60 points should be used as the passing standard.</p>
<p>Article 8 The graduation examinations in various regions should be held within the last week of June and the first week of January each year. The location of the examination shall be determined and announced by the competent educational administrative agency. In areas with a wider area and a large number of students, the examination should be conducted in different areas for the convenience of students, but it must still be held in accordance with the prescribed dates.</p>
<p>The questions used in the examination shall be determined by the question-setting committee of the examination committee, and the test papers shall be prepared and sealed by the competent educational administrative agency.</p>
<p>Article 9 Students must pass all subjects in the graduation examination to graduate. The graduation certificate shall be issued by the school after being stamped by the provincial or municipal educational administrative agency and affixed with the "Graduation Examination Passed" seal.</p>
<p>Article 10 Those who fail in three or more subjects in the examination should be ordered to repeat the grade. Those who cannot repeat the grade due to special reasons may be given a certificate of completion by the original school, stating the grades of each subject in the graduation examination, and affixing the "Graduation Examination Failed" seal.</p>
<p>Article 11 Those who fail in one or two subjects in the examination shall be allowed to continue to participate in two graduation examinations of various subjects for two sessions. Only after passing can they graduate. If there are still subjects that fail, they should take the examination for all subjects.

Not a single day's work can be relaxed and time wasted. If something is done wrong, it should be corrected immediately. Progress should be made day by day. This is the true spirit of doing things, so-called "renewing it day after day, and again day after day." One must not make the bad habit of just getting through the day.

<p>英鎊前途之推測  冷波</p>
<p>Speculation on the Future of the British Pound by Leng Bo</p>
<p>在過去半年中，英鎊呈鬆弱之勢，以美元而言，由五·一〇元跌至四·八五元，以法郎而言，由七六·二五法郎跌至七三法郎。惟其跌落的步調，並非一致，時而緊張，時而弛緩，此乃因其所遭受的各種影響有所不同故也。如去年秋季對於美元的收買，去年十一月間金集團之政治與金融的紊亂，以及最近美國金條欺案尚未宣判以前的凌亂等是，英鎊之價值在此半年中僅跌百分之四，故較稱穩定。然而尚引起不良的批評，而金鎊在歐陸各令融中心在不久以前，亦失其信仰。</p>
<p>In the past six months, the British pound has shown a weakening trend, falling from $5.10 to $4.85 in terms of the U.S. dollar, and from 76.25 francs to 73 francs in terms of the French franc. However, the pace of the decline has not been consistent, sometimes tight and sometimes relaxed, due to the different influences it has been subjected to. These include the purchase of U.S. dollars last autumn, the political and financial turmoil of the gold bloc last November, and the recent chaos before the verdict in the U.S. gold bar fraud case. The value of the British pound has only fallen by 4% in the past six months, so it is relatively stable. However, it has still attracted negative criticism, and the gold pound has also lost its credibility in various European financial centers not long ago.</p>
<p>欲找出最近英鎊跌落的根本原因，實非易事。據英國貿易局（Board　of　Trade）最近的估計，英國國際收支的不利差額僅為一百萬鎊，此種估計固難精確，但是耶使在英國有利的方面再多估出一二千萬鎊，而常此資金大量移動中的今日，其所估計之不利差額之數目，亦不足為影響鎊價主要的原因。再據一月份之貿易報吿所示，英國之貿易地位並未退步，其貿易不利差額，亦較去年同期减少。至於英鎊之購買力，若與一年前或去年八月間之法郎及美元的購買力相較，則英鎊以美元而言。其價值尚為高估，但最後美國物價之高漲及鎊滙之縮短，則此項價值的為估，遂歸消滅；惟以法郎而言，英鎊之價值，仍為低估，其低估之程度雖較八月間者稍大，但僅抵去年二月間者三分之二。</p>
<p>It is not easy to find the root cause of the recent fall in the British pound. According to the recent estimates of the British Board of Trade, the unfavorable balance of the British international payments is only one million pounds. Although such estimates are difficult to be accurate, even if the favorable aspects of the British side are overestimated by ten or twenty million pounds, the estimated amount of unfavorable differences is insufficient to be the main reason for affecting the pound price in today's large-scale movement of funds. Furthermore, according to the trade report in January, the trade position of the United Kingdom has not deteriorated, and its trade imbalance has also decreased compared with the same period last year. As for the purchasing power of the British pound, compared with the purchasing power of the franc and the U.S. dollar a year ago or in August last year, the value of the British pound is still overestimated in terms of the U.S. dollar, but the final surge in U.S. prices and the shortening of the pound exchange rate have eliminated this value's estimation; however, in terms of the franc, the value of the British pound is still underestimated, although the degree of undervaluation is slightly larger than that in August, but only two-thirds of that in February last year.</p>
<p>吾人甚易誤視美元價值的低估與法郎價值的高估，其中間之差別是使英鎊跌落的主因。實則些三種貨幣間之差異，自去年起已大為减少也。且此種差異，即使無英鎊的跌價，亦可有同樣之减少。蓋因美元與法郎間的平衡已日趨接近，而英鎊在此二幣間所處之地位，則須由其本身的特殊因素而决定耳。其决定之原因究竟如何？有如下文所述：</p>
<p>It is easy for us to mistakenly view the undervaluation of the U.S. dollar and the overvaluation of the French franc, and the difference between them as the main reason for the fall of the British pound. In fact, the difference between these three currencies has been greatly reduced since last year. Moreover, this difference can be reduced in the same way even without the depreciation of the British pound, because the balance between the U.S. dollar and the French franc is getting closer, and the position of the British pound between these two currencies must be determined by its own special factors. What are the reasons for the decision? The following is described:</p>
<p>首先吾人須知英鎊與各種金幣（美元亦包括在內）間的關係，不僅是受英國國內的貿易情形所決定，而亦受英鎊集團整個酌貿易情形所決定。倘英帝國（包含加拿大澳洲南非等在內）阿根庭及其他金幣國家間的貿易衰落，而英鎊集團內部的滙兌率仍無變更時，則此種壓迫，即不免於英鎊滙價上表現。在英國的各統治邦中其地位亦有不如一年前的强固者，例如澳洲羊毛出口價值之縮减，即其一端。其次吾人對於倫敦與其他各國金融的中心的利息水準，亦應加以注意。英國政府所採行的低利政策Cheap　Money　Rolicy　,使短期利率降至最抵之紀錄。長期者亦降至三厘以下，實較巴黎現行之利率為低，但其低於紐約者之程度不若低於巴黎者之甚，按正統經濟學派的理論，倫敦資金將自然流入巴黎，吾人對於此種解釋，須</p>
<p>First of all, we must know that the relationship between the British pound and various gold coins (including the U.S. dollar) is not only determined by the domestic trade situation in the United Kingdom, but also by the entire trade situation of the British pound bloc. If trade between the British Empire (including Canada, Australia, South Africa, etc.), Argentina, and other gold coin countries declines, and the exchange rate within the British pound bloc remains unchanged, then this pressure will inevitably be reflected in the pound exchange rate. The position of the British dominions is also less strong than it was a year ago, such as the reduction in the export value of Australian wool, which is one aspect. Secondly, we should also pay attention to the interest rate levels of London and other financial centers in various countries. The cheap money policy adopted by the British government has reduced the short-term interest rate to the lowest record. Long-term rates have also fallen below 3%, which is lower than the current interest rate in Paris, but the extent to which it is lower than that in New York is not as great as that in Paris. According to the theory of the orthodox economics school, London funds will naturally flow into Paris. We must</p>
<p>第一為存於倫敦之外幣的數量問題，其準確數目，吾人不得而知，但可得而言者，為較一九三一年恐慌發生以前為少。倫敦之情况，固較四年前為鞏固。但倘政府不加干涉，即不甚激烈之提欵，亦可使其滙價跌落。吾人更應加以注意者，為倫敦與巴黎間短期利率之差額，久與遠期法郎的貼現相抵，蓋該貼現即至今日，仍等於年利一厘半也。是以法國銀行現在收買英國庫券（Treasury　Bill）可賺利二厘，興能，則英國之投資家對於在歐陸的長期投資，常取審愼之態度，固不僅視利息之厚薄而已也</p>
<p>First, there is the issue of the amount of foreign currency stored in London. We cannot know the exact number, but what we can say is that it is less than before the panic in 1931. The situation in London is certainly more solid than it was four years ago. However, if the government does not intervene, even a not-so-drastic withdrawal of funds can cause its exchange rate to fall. What we should pay more attention to is the difference between the short-term interest rates in London and Paris, which has long been offset by the discount on forward francs, because that discount is still equal to an annual interest rate of 1.5% even today. Therefore, French banks can now earn a 2% profit by buying British Treasury Bills. Therefore, British investors often take a cautious attitude towards long-term investments in Europe, not only considering the thickness of interest rates.</p>
<p>此外吾人對於心理上的形態，亦應加以注意。蓋當此他國資金大量兼容避之際，心理作用甚關重要。約於三星期前，外人對於英鎊之信心，因種種原因，突受搖撼。其原恩呢如樹脂與胡椒投機之失敗，而使國外金融受極大之影響。更甚者如因Wavertree地方的選舉與失業協助的計劃而造成政府行將改組及普選先期舉行之種利謠言；而其發生適當關於金集國各國幣制穩定與否的謠言叢生之時，故產生一種疑慮之觀念。念其觀為：凡一種不穩定之貨幣有時必將跌落，英國，欲一方採行無限制的低利政策，而同時又希望維持其鎊的穩定，實不可能</p>
<p>In addition, we should also pay attention to the psychological form. Because when other countries' funds are highly compatible and avoid, the psychological effect is very important. About three weeks ago, foreigners' confidence in the British pound was suddenly shaken for various reasons. The original gracefulness is like the failure of resin and pepper speculation, which has a great impact on foreign finance. Even more so, the rumors that the government will be reorganized and general elections will be held in advance due to the election in Wavertree and the unemployment assistance plan; and its occurrence is appropriate when rumors about the stability of the currency system of the gold collective countries are rampant, so a concept of doubt arises. Reading it is that: any unstable currency will inevitably fall sometimes. It is impossible for the United Kingdom to adopt an unrestricted low-interest policy on the one hand, while hoping to maintain the stability of its pound.</p>
<p>此種心理上的原因，或為暫時的現象，但實予吾人一種警吿。是時英國政府證券適大漲價，而外國投資者，對英國在議會的生命能否持久，方有疑問。是以許多外國投資家，以為現在為拋資英國證券最宜之時，以便獲利，而將其資金再運還本國。對於工黨將來得權之推測，無論其為正確，或為錯誤，皆足減少英鎊之信用。該黨對於凡已經林用過的各種金本位皆拒絕復用，並希望用國際的動作以穩定滙兌，簡言之，該黨之方策尚未確定，然而其引起外人對於英鎊不信任之處，由於其貨幣政策者少，而由於其增加歲出所生之恐慌則更多也，故此種疑慮。只有該黨領袖始能使其消散。</p>
<p>This psychological reason may be a temporary phenomenon, but it actually gives us a warning. At that time, British government securities rose sharply, and foreign investors questioned whether the United Kingdom's life in parliament could last. Therefore, many foreign investors thought that now was the best time to throw British securities in order to make profits and transport their funds back to their home countries. Speculation about the Labour Party's future accession to power, whether correct or wrong, is sufficient to reduce the credit of the British pound. The party refuses to reuse all kinds of gold standards that have been used in the past, and hopes to use international actions to stabilize exchange rates. In short, the party's strategy has not yet been determined. However, the distrust of foreigners in the British pound is less due to its monetary policy and more due to the panic caused by its increased expenditure. Therefore, this doubt. Only the party leader can dispel it.</p>
<p>同時吾人所欲問者，為英鎊跌價是否易生有害之影響？英鎊每跌落一次，即增加金集團之困難一次，而上漲則為該團所歡迎，然英鎊的價值縱有最近之跌落，但若與一般貨幣比較。尚無十分低估之象。</p>
<p>At the same time, what we want to ask is whether the depreciation of the British pound is likely to have a harmful impact? Every time the British pound falls, it increases the difficulty of the gold group by one time, and the rise is welcomed by the group, but even if the value of the British pound has fallen recently, if compared with the general currency. There is still no sign of significant undervaluation.</p>
<p>英鎊現狀雖不是發生恐慌，然亦不應聽其自然，凡由於投機及心理的關係而發生倫敦資金的外流，應自行抵消，蓋此種原因不合於眞正之經濟事實的情况，而不久即可自然矯正也。惟以往資金外流之所以不能抵消者，或因其當局者認為此乃資金之正當的减少，或因平準基金之來源，不足以維持此項困難工作。在第一種情形下，則不當用任何方法以停止其外流。在第二種情形下，則無方法能使其停止也。如提高銀行利率，則其擾亂國內外信用之影響，將較吸收外資流入倫敦者為甚。一九三二年至一九三三年聞所積累之現金，此時若有一部份輸出國外，尤其在此項輸出外復有外人提取倫敦之存欵時，則其為衰弱現象的表示，自較英鎊逐漸跌落者為尤顯著。</p>
<p>Although the current situation of the British pound is not a panic, it should not be allowed to take its course. All the outflow of London funds due to speculation and psychological relations should be offset by itself, because this reason is not in line with the true economic situation, and it will be naturally corrected soon. However, the reason why the past outflow of funds cannot be offset is either because the authorities believe that this is a legitimate reduction of funds, or because the source of the stabilization fund is insufficient to maintain this difficult work. In the first case, no methods should be used to stop the outflow. In the second case, there is no way to stop it. If the bank interest rate is raised, its impact on disrupting domestic and foreign credit will be greater than attracting foreign investment into London. If a part of the cash accumulated from 1932 to 1933 is exported abroad at this time, especially when foreigners withdraw their deposits in London after this export, it is a sign of weakness, which is more obvious than the gradual fall of the British pound.</p>
<p>但以上各種可能情勢，距今尚屬遼遠。現在英鎊之跌落，僅在與以前數月之穩定狀態比較而顯著。在英鎊仍未穩定，尤其是市塲仍為心理作用所波動之時，則最近數週所發生之各種現象，殆屬無可避免也。</p>
<p>However, the above possible situations are still far away from now. The current fall of the British pound is only significant when compared with the stable state of the previous months. When the British pound is still unstable, especially when the market is still fluctuating due to psychological effects, the various phenomena that have occurred in recent weeks are almost inevitable.</p>

<p>Chewing on a certain section in his mind again and again, then calculating with his fingers, "This is the 'Month of忌 (Ji)'! This is the 'Month of忌 (Ji)'!" He raised his head, the oil stains and powder residue on the stolen small pine and locust trees seemed like the blurry flesh of his ancestors, and tears welled up! (The living lion is struggling, the mountain god is roaring, and the ancestral spirit is cursing, cursing whom? Cursing the unfilial descendants—himself!) Unfilial! What a grave sin! If I let these guys go again this time, then my whole life would be in vain, and I would truly be letting down my ancestors in the ground! So he prepared to concentrate all his accumulated anger—even the anger from the last time the ××× Association forcibly felled ancient trees—to burn He Xinye. He stroked his sparse, white beard and decided to reply to the mediator who would come in the afternoon: At the very least, there must be a firecracker ban and a mountain sealing, guaranteeing that within three years there will be no illnesses or harm to the family, otherwise, send him to jail! Angrily, he packed the compass into a small blue cloth bag, mustered his remaining strength to get up, and, leaning on a wooden cane, turned to the left side of the mountain, gently stroking the "Rhinoceros Gazing at the Moon Stone" that had been lying there for countless years. From the marks of wind and rain erosion on the stone, he thought of the current dilapidated mountain appearance and the declining human fortune, he bowed his head, and two clear tears flowed down both resentfully and secretly. Afterward, he staggered home along a small path overgrown with weeds. At lunchtime, it seemed as if the ancestors had tightened the old man's throat, and he didn't want to eat. After repeated persuasion from his wife and son, he went to the table. Just as he picked up the bowl, his hand slipped, and the bowl shattered on the ground, with rice and broken pieces scattering all over the room. "Damn it! This is not a good sign! That bastard He Xinye must be dealt with severely. Quickly, arrange the package for me!" The meal didn't happen, and his wife and son were so anxious that they kept pinching their thighs. At this moment, the mediator, Wang Tuanzong, and Cai Huzhang, the head of the household affairs, walked in. Cai Huzhang had a mouth skilled in eloquent speech. As soon as he entered, he said "久遂 (jiǔ suí)" (a polite greeting, like "I've been remiss in visiting") and inquired about the old man's health. Wang Tuanzong also followed suit with conventional greetings, which forced the old man to put on a smiling face to welcome them. After they had tea, they turned the conversation to the main topic: "He Xinye is ignorant. We've scolded him a good deal. Elder, please, for our sake, be a little lenient?" Cai Huzhang said gently. "Of course, of course! But the last time the trees on my ancestral graves were completely cut down, my eldest son died as a result. I can't be lenient this time. At the very least, there must be a firecracker ban and mountain sealing, guaranteeing that my family suffers no more harm within three years!" the old man stammered in reply. Wang Tuanzong continued, "Guarantee... we can't take on such a big responsibility." "That won't do. I'll have to send him to jail!" the old man shook his head resolutely. The atmosphere of despair pressed on them, and they took their leave of the old man with unnatural smiles. The old man called out to Kezi to quickly bring out the package. Lianjiang Shang Tuo Ren A spring countryside trip is likely to make one's mood burn with a faint warmth. It was afternoon, the sun's soft light dazzled people's eyes, leaping on the earth. When the train arrived at Longjing, the station became a bustling market town. The noisy voices of the country folk echoed in every corner around the station. Those who came out of the train platform walked along the small gravel path. After about a few hundred steps, they arrived at the pier for the steamboats going to the upper reaches of the Lianjiang River. Although Longjing Port did not have ships sailing to the open sea, nor did it have the magnificent docks of a trading port, it did have customs, a very large checkpoint. On the shore, patrolling police officers were walking with large strides, their eyes watching the passengers and their luggage boarding and disembarking as if they were thieves. The reason was that Longjing Port could directly connect to overseas. The reports often carried stories of foreigners smuggling goods into the Chaoshan area along the coast, and this was their usual route. Fierce tides rushed into the small port, tightly squeezed between the mountain peaks. The color of the water was peach red, like a red velvet blanket covering Longjing Port. When the tide receded back into the sea, the vast water surface would reveal patches of red sand and mud, as if sailing in the sea, one could see the belly of a large fish, rolling on the water's surface, shimmering with the golden light of the sun. The small steamer going to the upper reaches of the Lianjiang River departed in the afternoon. It took about an hour to enter the Lianjiang River. The water gradually changed from red to green. If one were to stand on a higher mountain peak and look down, the winding river would look like a silver chain placed on the ground, with a tranquil spring flowing from top to bottom. The water was a sheet of emerald green, without a single ripple, as smooth as a piece of glass wiped with white powder. Green bamboo thickets embraced both banks, with some branches extending into the space, closely connected, reflecting a dark shadow on the water surface. If one looked up, the vast sky and sea would become a very small Milky Way, shining in harmony with the green water below. The people sitting in the cabin, when they reached the midway point, climbed onto the deck one by one. The sound of their conversations, like the sound of the engine, reverberated through the quiet villages on both banks of the river. People in the city rarely see thatched houses in the countryside. Here, they are displayed like an exhibition, showing all kinds of houses from centuries ago. Country folk who walk across the stone bridges that have been around for hundreds of years also stare blankly at these people standing on the deck, as if saying: What's so fun about the countryside? After the boat had been traveling on the river for several hours, many dilapidated houses appeared on both banks, some tall and some short, all lying in ruins in the fields. According to the country folk on the boat, this was once a very lively village a few years ago. In recent years, droughts and floods have left it uninhabited. Country folk talk incessantly. He talked about the ruins and the fields in the wilderness. He continued, "Country folk rely on the harvest every year. You see the good green rice stalks on the shore and think the harvest must be good. But even a good year's harvest is not enough to pay off debts, so now even the people have run away, and there are far fewer farmers." The tranquil Lianjiang River, the beautiful Lianjiang River, although it irrigates countless fields, only a few receive the blessings it gives to the country folk. Farewell Hu Weixiong The night before, I chatted with the host until late at night, hearing the sound of the clapper striking three in the morning in the distance before saying good night and retiring. In the countryside, as the setting sun slants westward, smoke rises from the chimneys, as families prepare dinner. Usually, after dinner, the old lady would take a puff of her water pipe, piously offer a stick of incense before the Buddha niche, then close her eyes and wrap her string of 108 prayer beads around her left wrist, softly chanting scriptures, turning the beads in her right hand to count, completing about an hour of meritorious service. During this time, my little friend would study the characters taught by his grandmother in the morning. The child was very intelligent, and rarely made mistakes in recognizing the characters with many strokes or those that looked similar after reading them. Sometimes we would also tell stories or play with the educational six-sided pictures that his father had bought for him. Although I was a big child myself, and had learned some so-called "art of living" in the waves of life, the child and I got along very well for two months, and he didn't feel that I was older than the age of his playmate! Perhaps my precious innocence hadn't been completely swallowed up by the huge waves? During this short convalescence period, I filled two thick notebooks with diary entries, writing nearly a thousand words each day. I had abandoned this courage for a long time! Seventy percent of it recorded my experiences of wandering around with a cane, and more than 20,000 words commemorated the revival of my childlike heart. Now, I have hidden these two notebooks in my trunk. Since my trip to Xiaonv Temple, I haven't dared to visit scenic spots again. Content with what I have, I want to keep these excellent images deep in my mind, as vivid as if I were still there. Moreover, my vacation is also coming to an end, and this untethered heart will be sent back into the huge waves to be tempered! Three days ago, I told the host about my return date. The old lady, as if unwilling to see her son leave as she did in the past, planned many ways that were almost like coaxing a child to extend my stay. Having grown up being blown about by the wild wind, I almost wanted to live in the warm room of maternal love. I initially stayed at this foreign inn as a traveler, but who would have thought that when the little friend saw me off at the pier, I would shed a few clear tears, tears that I had never shed in the face of storms! Yesterday afternoon, I sorted out the books and simple luggage I had brought. The host sat by the window, burning paper offerings, and did not want to smoke a pipe. I tried my best to lower my head to avoid her gaze, but the oppressive atmosphere made the child, who was snuggled in his grandmother's lap, remain motionless for a long time. Finally, I took the child for a walk nearby, barely managing to send the sun back to the western mountains. Last night's dinner was especially lavish. The host even urged me to drink wine infused with rose petals. I drank three glasses without knowing why, and didn't feel drunk at all. Normally, I would probably have been unconscious long ago. After dinner, when the child brought out his character box, the host told him to play with his building blocks instead, and started chatting with me, holding her water pipe and rambling on. The host was usually talkative, but yesterday she kept repeating old stories more than twice, and kept lighting up paper offerings, forgetting even the ritual of offering incense to the Buddha. Huang Ma occasionally peeked from behind the door, perhaps surprised by the abnormal behavior of us, the host and guest? I was unusually excited and completely forgot about sleep. When I heard the sound of the clapper striking three in the morning, the host exclaimed in surprise, "What? It's three in the morning!" This ended our conversation. Back in my bedroom, I still had no desire to sleep. I took out the diary I had put in my suitcase and reviewed it until I could no longer bear the fatigue and fell asleep at my desk. In the morning, Huang Ma told me that the old lady had caught a cold last night and couldn't get out of bed today, so she asked her grandson to see me off at the pier. I really wanted to go to her bedroom to say goodbye, but I keenly thought that what if the host was sitting there smoking her water pipe perfectly well? So I asked Huang Ma to convey my farewell and left the home of this warm friend, which had felt like home for the past two months!

Radio Broadcast Programs Ballads Jiang Ruting, Zhu Jiesheng—Fallen Rosy Clouds, Lone Goose Frightened Sino-Western (1040) 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM Opening: "Spring Scenery" The return of spring brings a fresh atmosphere. The gentle breeze intoxicates people. Look at the red peach blossoms, red and vibrant. The willows are green, deep and lush. Even the wheat seedlings are green and blue. The cold plums are blooming and about to wither, while the narcissus are just budding. A garden of spring cannot be contained, with fragrant grass filling the courtyard like a green carpet. See the groups of red men and green women, all going out for spring outings and picnics. Innocent children go to the open fields, launching kites into the air with strings. As the vernal equinox approaches, widows visit new graves by the roadside. The sounds of crying shake the heavens, saddening the gods, like lamentations that move the soul. The ancients held banquets in peach and plum gardens at night, so spring is the most pleasant time. Timely enjoyment does no harm, and this spring scenery only increases the joy. Country folk have the custom of beating the spring ox, saying that this year the five grains will be abundant. However, the bankruptcy of the countryside is unspeakable. A year of abundance is still poorer than a year of famine. Heavy taxes and miscellaneous levies are frequently added, and the dying farmers suffer unbearably. With no clothes and no food, they are truly pitiable. I plead for the farmers. May you, my esteemed gentlemen, quickly revitalize the countryside. Gentlemen, in this spring season, should all strive to move forward. Spring is the beginning of the four seasons of the year, and morning is the key to the day. Spring is the plan for the year.

The good of powerful families are the fools of public families. The likes of Xiao He and Han Xin are seen as loyal by Emperor Gaozu, but as traitors by Xiang Bo. The likes of Du Qin and Gu Yong are seen as loyal by Wang Feng, but as traitors by Han Zhi. Then, are the loyal ministers of usurping rulers not the traitors of a well-governed world? Zang Aibo's advice against the Gao Tripod is correct in its words, but the person he is speaking to is wrong. Anyone who murders a ruler, all officials should be killed without pardon. Anyone who murders a father, all officials should be killed without pardon. Duke Huan murdered his brother and his minister murdered his ruler. All in the state of Lu, even the lowliest servants should be cut down and slaughtered. How much more should Aibo, a hereditary minister of Lu, who has a salary from the state, taxes from the ruler, and duties in the sacrifices, not bear to sit by and watch without saving? If he has the power to punish, then he should do so. If he does not have the power to punish, then he should leave. Now, he lowers his head and bends his knee, going to court every day, and offering loyal words to make up for his shortcomings. He is certainly not disloyal to Duke Huan, but is he not disloyal to Duke Yin?

<p>Supplement to the "Shen Bao" Local Edition Movie Special Issue Lowly Origins of Famous European and American Directors Zhu Heng Directors can be considered the most important job in the film industry. It requires life experience and knowledge of all production departments. Many famous European and American directors have struggled their way up from humble occupations. Even many of today's top directors did not originally come from the film industry. Some were only engaged in stage comedy, and there is no shortage of people who have never even worked in theater. Ernst Lubitsch, the big name, was a comedian in Berlin as far back as 1913. Because he felt that the plays he was performing lacked suitable material, he decided to write his own scripts and take on the role of director. That attempt was successful, and the company trusted him, assigning him to write, direct, and star in a two-reel comedy short film. Later, when he directed Pola Negri's "Carmen," he abandoned short films and became a director of comedies. Frank Capra used to be a comedian at Hal Roach and Mack Sennett's film companies, which specialized in producing slapstick short films. When the famous comedian Harry Langdon decided to act in a feature film, he hired Capra to direct "The Strong Man," and this debut work was selected as one of the top ten films of 1926. Walter Forde, the British director of "Rome Express" and the anti-Chinese film "Jack Ahoy," used to be a musician in an orchestra. After the war, he invested all his savings in the film industry. As a result, he directed a comedy short film. Although he unfortunately went bankrupt, he later became famous for directing a feature film called "Would You Believe It?" Frank Borzage started out directing American Westerns. Later, he gradually transformed into a famous master of sentimental romance films. His famous works include "Seventh Heaven" and "Man's Castle," etc. Cecil B. DeMille's first work was "The Squaw Man" ("The Trail of the Lonesome Pine"). This was the first film produced in Hollywood in 1913. That same year was also when he and Jesse L. Lasky began to found Paramount Pictures. Frank Lloyd was also a pioneer in the film industry. In 1913, he only played a bit part actor in "Shadows of Life." Later, he became a screenwriter and director of short films. Dorothy Arzner is one of the few female directors in Hollywood. Before becoming a director, she was just a film editor. Later, she gained the company's trust and became a director. Her debut work was "Fashions for Women." George Cukor can be considered a rising star among many contemporary directors. His masterpiece is "Little Women." His debut work was "The Royal Family of Broadway." Undoubtedly, it was most appropriate for him to direct this film, because he was a famous stage manager in New York. In fact, "The Royal Family of Broadway" was not his first job, because he had already written a lot of dialogue for "All Quiet on the Western Front." Victor Saville, the director of the British blockbuster "The Dictator," was a film dealer before the war. Later, he directed an advertising film for an American oil company, thus beginning his film career. The first film he officially directed was a silent film called "Woman to Woman." Rene Clair, the famous French director, was a journalist before entering the film industry in 1922. His debut work was "The Crazy Ray," and his famous masterpiece was "The Italian Straw Hat." G.W. Pabst, the famous German director of literary films "Don Quixote," "Kameradschaft," and "The White Hell of Piz Palü," became famous after directing the Greta Garbo-starring "The Joyless Street" in Germany. Movie Review of "A Flower on Peng Island" You Jing "Red Morning"—Grand Shanghai Theater A film mainly set against the warm wind and waves of the South China Sea and the beautiful scenery of Peng Island, it can be said to satisfy the entertainment desires of gentlemen who are tired of writing in the office and tired of the dance halls and brothels. It is more like a reflection of the desire of people who are suffocated by gold and goods, hoping to rediscover some new island where they can make a difference. This can be seen from "Fragrant Sea," "Peng Island Spring," "Pearl Island," "The Adventures of an Adventuress," and the currently showing "A Flower on Peng Island." Although these films do not seem to make explicit expressions subjectively or directly, it is obvious that they are consciously or unconsciously adapting to these requirements. For example, "A Flower on Peng Island" seems to be expressing a didactic story about how bad people will eventually destroy themselves under the guise of love, but in its devoted depiction of the life of aborigines on the barren island of the South China Sea, it clearly hints at this way out. For example, the playwright makes the daughter of the shipowner, Bai Laisha, giving the aborigines a water injection, and saving the chairman's son, Mayo, from death, as the main key, in order to show that she obtained the qualifications of a distinguished guest from the status of a prisoner. It also emphasized that setting off fireworks was enough to scare away thousands of armed aborigines, that Karan single-handedly rescued her lover, John, who was about to be burned by the aborigines, and that Karan only needed to strike a board to make a sound, which was passed on by the aborigines' watchers beating drums, and then tens of thousands of aborigines would come with spears and boats to save her, etc., all implying how easily white people could establish relationships with those aborigines on the barren islands, or that the honest and useless aborigines were eagerly awaiting civilized people to conquer them. Apart from these, we can see from the technical aspect that "A Flower on Peng Island" is not such a great work. Let's start with an analogy! The material of "A Flower on Peng Island" could have been made into a simple, elegant, and self-admiring plum blossom, but now it has been turned into a bonsai by a very mediocre gardener. But here, there are also the heavy drum sounds and simple songs and dances of the aborigines on the desert island, as well as the paintings and sounds of wild fires and lush forests. However, the necessary movements of vigor, wildness, and strength are not well expressed due to poor editing. The so-called poor editing is mainly too chaotic. For example, when describing the three parties of the aborigines helping Karan and her husband fight against the bad guy Stan Gan, it is so chaotic that it loses the due sense of urgency. Long distant shots are often used, which weakens the short, urgent melody. It should have been an extremely fast tempo after the ship was wrecked, but Karan was allowed to leisurely search for her lost father with a lamp. What is more successful is the emotional expression. On the evening before the ship wrecked, Karan's reminiscence of her father, the scenes before and after her father's death, and the separation from Mayo, all successfully touched the audience and achieved excellent results. This is not due to the successful surgery of director Wallace Fordes, but to the heroine Stephanie Dawn. Judging from her face and figure, she is really better at playing a desolate and plain role than a female hero of nautical adventure. The success and failure here is a clear proof. Real Peach Blossom River Discovered During Location Shooting A few days ago, a Tianyi film crew was shooting location scenes for "Returning Home" in the western suburbs of Shanghai. In front of the peach blossom forest, there was a small river with clear blue water and exceptionally beautiful scenery. We usually love to sing "Peach Blossom River" and always think that "Peach Blossom River" is ideal. Little did we know that the place where we are filming today is the real "Peach Blossom River"! "Rainbow Tune" Coming Soon Yunshan Cicely Courtneidge is a monster on the European stage and screen. People call her the female Chaplin. The films she has starred in that have been screened in Shanghai include "Maytime," "Almost a Honeymoon," and "Spring in the Air." These three films received very good reviews when they were first released in Shanghai. Now, we are about to see her new work "Rainbow Tune" (Aunt Sally). Like "Maytime," it is also a musical comedy. Here, Courtneidge plays a girl who is obsessed with song and dance. At first, because she was not a well-known actress, she was repeatedly rejected by the troupe leader. However, she was not discouraged and still tried her best to play the main character in the play. As the saying goes, "Where there's a will, there's a way," and she finally achieved the final victory. The entire film is organized with fresh and humorous material, and there are several song and dance scenes that are very novel and beautiful. Everything is no less than Courtneidge's previous works. It is said that it will be released at the Guanglu Theater in the coming days. Tianyi Gossips Bai Yun Gao Lihong's illness has not yet healed. Shen Yongshi had a daughter seven days ago. Xiao Zhengzhong plays a doctor in "Returning Home." Newcomers Lin Cuifang and Yu Yingjun performed in "Returning Home." According to Wang Bin, the score work for "Mother" will be completed within a few days. Among the new films planned to be filmed this year, there will be one entirely set against the "sea." Tianyi is determined to cultivate newcomers and is currently studying what kind of strategy to adopt. The songs in "Returning Home" will also be printed and distributed to all sectors. The city street scene in "Returning Home" has not yet been filmed due to rain. The song "Sunny Day" in "Returning Home" is full of poetry and extremely gentle and moving. When filming the hospital scene in "Returning Home," several doctors from Chen Mo Pediatric Hospital came to visit and were very satisfied with all the equipment and arrangements. Movie Novel After Office Hours (4) Tong Yun Pennistead lowered his head and whispered in her ear, "Who is that? I haven't met him, remind me." Sharon smiled, "Maybe he hasn't seen you either, but let's talk about it. He is the editor-in-chief of the News Record, Jem Brown. He says he knows you, maybe he has an ulterior motive, you have to be careful..." Pennistead said, "Sharon, I don't think you believe the rumors outside, do you?" At this time, Mrs. Patterson, Julia, saw that the two of them were talking intimately, and couldn't help but feel jealous. She smiled and scolded Sharon, "Sharon, your flirting skills are really not bad." Jem secretly glanced at Mrs. Patterson, knowing the hidden pain in her heart. Although this was not his business, he felt sorry for her. He turned his mind and walked to Sharon Alcott's side again, saying indifferently as if nothing had happened, "Tomorrow morning when you come to</p>

<h3 id="e191">China Educational Film Association: Shanghai Branch Held Annual Meeting Yesterday; Headquarters and Party and Government Organs Sent Representatives to Give Instructions; Tong Hangbai, Pan Gongzhan, and Others Elected as Directors and Supervisors <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the China Educational Film Association held its second annual meeting at the Municipal Public Education Hall at 2:00 PM yesterday. More than 90 members attended. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Members Present: Including Pan Gongzhan, Tong Hangbai, Li Zhaohuan, Jiang Jianbai, Chen Bai, Yang Minshi, Zheng Zhengqiu, Xu Gongmei, Zheng Xiaoqiu, Yuan Zengyu, Chen Songchun, Shi Pengnian, Wu Bangfan, Ding Shouting, Lu Hailan, Hu Jiheng, and other ninety people. Pan Gongzhan, representative of the headquarters, Mao Yun, representative of the Municipal Party Department, and Nie Haifan, representative of the Municipal Education Bureau, attended and gave instructions.</p>
<p>Annual Meeting Situation: The meeting opened at 2:00 PM. The presidium was Pan Gongzhan, Chen Bai, and Zheng Zhengqiu, the recorder was Shi Pengnian, and the master of ceremonies was Yuan Zengyu. After the usual formalities, Chairman Zheng Zhengqiu first reported on the association's affairs, followed by speeches from Pan Gongzhan, representative of the headquarters, Mao Yun, representative of the Municipal Party Department, and Nie Haifan, representative of the Municipal Education Bureau. Then, proposals were discussed, and officials were elected. The meeting adjourned after a group photo.</p>
<p>Pan's Speech: Mr. Pan Gongzhan, representing the headquarters, gave a speech saying, "Today, the Shanghai branch of the China Educational Film Association is holding its second annual meeting. In the past two years, whether from the perspective of career or membership, the Shanghai branch can be seen as the most powerful branch in the entire organization of the China Educational Film Association. I hope you will continue to work hard to reach the headquarters' expectations for the Shanghai branch. However, when we review the past, there is one point that should be noted, that is, the members who joined the Shanghai branch are mostly from the film industry, and fewer from the education field. This proves that the Shanghai education field has not yet recognized the effectiveness of film in education, so they cannot be interested in the association and maintain a cold attitude, making it very difficult to promote our work. The reason is that we cannot shirk our responsibility for the educational films we show not being satisfactory. Therefore, in the future, I hope the film industry will take more responsibility, produce domestically made educational films, and cooperate with the education field to make them suitable for the needs of Chinese students," and so on.</p>
<p>Discussion of Proposals: One proposal: Regarding a matter discussed at the third joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committee of the second session of the branch, that the branch should establish a fund management committee to raise funds, but there is no such provision in the constitution, so a clause should be added to the constitution. It is proposed to pass it and then submit it to the annual meeting for ratification. Resolution: Add a clause to Chapter 3 of the constitution: "This branch may establish special committees when necessary, and the detailed rules will be formulated separately," etc. recorded in the minutes. Now, a special request is made for ratification. Resolution: Approve the ratification.</p>
<p>Election Results: This session adopted a postal election. The ballots were opened in public yesterday. As a result, Tong Hangbai, Jiang Jianbai, Chen Heqin, Li Zhaohua, Zhou Jianyun, Yang Minshi, and Lu Shibai were elected as directors. Gao Tianlou, Chen Songchun, Yao Sufeng, and Tao Bosun are alternates. Pan Gongzhan, Wu Kaixian, Chen Bai, Zheng Zhengqiu, and Xu Gongmei are supervisors. Jin Jingyu, Shao Zuiweng, and Bu Wancang are alternates.</p>

<p>Recently, it was telegraphed that the puppet Puyi went to Japan, Japanese detectives were all over the key transportation points, and a large number of Chinese students in Japan were unjustly arrested. The Zhonghua Student Association was also surrounded and searched. These phenomena occurred amidst the expulsion of overseas Chinese from Japan, which is unfortunate. It is understood that the World Student Association in Shanghai has sent a letter to students in Japan to inquire about the truth in order to negotiate. It is found that under the management and leadership of Minister Jiang and Supervisor Zhou, Chinese students in Japan have always been quite disciplined. Now, unjust arrests are truly intolerable under international public law.</p>

We have obtained the full support of the publishing and news industries in this city and other places, either by issuing special publications or holding special low prices. We have always admired your bureau's efforts in cultural work and presiding over education. For this reason, we intend to ask you to order all levels of schools in the city to simultaneously hold Reading Movement Week during the period of the reading movement held by our association, and to hold student reading speech competitions to facilitate publicity and encouragement. We would be grateful if you would grant this request. In addition to the reading movement slogans, which will be sent by our association separately, this matter concerns encouraging youth and we hope that you will agree to it,' etc. Approved, it is deemed that the letter requests the notification of all items, which concern encouraging youth and promoting cultural construction, and should be handled accordingly.

Team A includes Wu Hanzhang, He Baoshan, Jin Zhongkang, Wang Zhilin, Zhang Liang, and Gu Huaiyuan. Team B includes Wan Jinsheng, Huang Rulin, Yang Guangxie, Lan Shijie, Zhou Ruquan, and Ji Yongqing.
