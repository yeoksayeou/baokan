<h3 id="c54">太平洋上列强商業戰爭之趨勢·素 <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>自上月二十九日日本正式通告華盛頓當局。廢止一九二二年二月六日所簽訂之華府條約以來。太平洋列强間之矛盾。已顯然日趨於激烈。蓋由軍事言則爲軍備擠張之白熱化。而由商業言。之爲市塲競爭之尖鋭化。二者皆有事實爲明體。而市塲競爭之激烈。尤無掩飾之餘地。據國民社上月十十八日華盛頓電訊。美國實業團體百餘家。組織遠東經濟調查團。擬於三月後首途西來。同時電通社東京電訊。亦有今年四月日本將組織中國市塲調查團之説。倫敦海縮談話。甫告破裂。日美二國卽紛紛以我國市塲爲進一步研究之對象。意義何在。不難推測而知。夫太平洋上之商業戰爭。固與列强之軍備擴張互爲因果。將來無論勝負誰屬。中國必爲犧牲。可無欵也。</p>
<p>列强在太平洋之商業戰爭。旣以中國爲最主要之的鵠。則由列强對華貿易關係之轉變而測量其在太平洋上商業勢力之消長。雖不必中亦不遠矣。吾人試首就美日間之競爭一言。自我國東北陷落以後。日本在太平洋上之勢力。驟然增長。故日本對於僞滿。視若禁臠。不肯令人染指。觀其一再改革在（滿）統治機關之事實。便知其處心積慮之斑。美國鑒於滿洲門户之封閉。固不勝其憤懣。而日本鑒於美國對華貿易之進展。亦深爲嫉妒。而亟謀排斥。卽如在去年前十個月中我國之進口貿易總額共計八八二·○○○·○○○元其中除由日本進口之一○三·○○○·○○○元外由美國進口者竟達二三三·○○○·○○○元。美日相較適成二與一之比。日美之對立。有此冷酷的數字爲指證。毌怪各有組織調查團以謀積極競爭之舉也。</p>
<p>抑今日太平洋列强間之商戰。猶非僅以日美競爭爲唯一之重心也。他如英日紡織品銷路之衝突。亦爲一顯著之現象。而英美商業利益之不能調和。又爲有目所共鑒。英國在大戰以前。久執遠東商業之牛耳。美爲後起之秀。乘歐戰而崛起。嗣後無論在歐洲或遠東市塲。均爲英人之勁敵。英之亟欲有以恢復其戰前之地位。固非一日。然迫於形勢。说顯有心餘力絀之苦。卽以英人年來之對華貿易論。其數量僅能勉與日本相埒。而不足仁與美人較雄長。今美國之遠東調查團。又將追隨英人之對滿調查團而來。英人對之。得毌有相逼已甚之感乎。</p>
<p>列强對於太平洋商業。之競爭。已視爲解决生産過剩之一方法。而此種競爭。將繼續爲今後太平洋國際關係中之要素。亦爲旣定局面。中國握遠東大局之重心。欲不爲列强之商戰所摧殘。自必有賴於自衛。而尤賴於全國上下速起合作以應付之矣。</p>

<p>薩爾投票的時期近了（法國通信）</p>
<p>法德糾紛的重心</p>
<p>煤鐵關係最重要</p>
<h3 id="c90">法意如果聯合德勢愈孤 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>薩爾這塊地方、面積祇有十九萬平方公里、人口僅七十八萬、何以在法德之間占如彼重要地位、甚至於會引起整個歐洲的變化、在從前巴黎講和會議開便時、爲了這塊土地、曾引起英總理路得喬治·與美總統威爾遜的反對、結果議定在一九三五年一月十三日舉行當地人民總投票、以决定薩爾之歸德或歸法、</p>
<p>論當地民族關係、百分之九十以上的人民是德國種、他們都説德國話、常習德意志的習慣、法蘭西人不過百分之三以至百分之五、所以大戰後、至於最近、這十五年間、法國每年用好幾千萬法郎、在那裏建立法語小學與工藝學校、而成績並不怎樣好、學生反一年比一年更少些、其他如新聞事業、文化講演等等收買人心的工作、總不能收到所豫期的效果、</p>
<p>原來在凡爾賽和平條約之前、德意志統治薩爾、自一八一六年到一九一八年、竟有一世紀以上的時間、而法蘭西領有該地、不過一七九二年到一八一五年廿二年而已、因此德意志民族、在當地占絕大多數、要在一二十年短時期中、當歐洲民族主義還盛行的時候、改换過人民的思想、自然是作不到的、如照常理推測、投票結果、恐不見得與法國有利、假設目前的德國、不壓迫猶太人、不壓迫天主敎徒、則薩爾人民、當然多會投歸復德國的票、現時住在薩爾的人民、旣顧慮到他們自已居住的安全、又感覺着將來的政治暴壓、那末對於歸復德國問題、自不能不有所躊躇了、</p>
<p>且事實上法國在訂立凡爾賽和約時、就凖備了這一着、把地面的治安和地下鑛藏分開、該項條約規定、如薩爾區投票結果、應歸復德國時、則德國須備現金收買鑛藏、否則薩爾的煁鑛鐵鑛、仍舊歸法蘭西所有、</p>
<p>一九三三年度、薩爾每月平均生産銑鐵十三萬噸、鋼十四萬噸、煤炭八十八萬噸、其銑鐵生産額、約等於全德意志生産總數的百分之二九、等於法蘭西生産總數的百分之二四、鋼的生産、約等於德國生産總額的百分之二二、法國的百分之二四、由此可知其地位的重要、德國當然想借此以恢復其國力、法國也要用來穩定他的霸權、尤其是德國倡言廢止凡爾賽和約之後、英國也暗示同情、意大利顯然表示該和約應卽改訂、於是法國前外長巴爾都奔馳風塵、先將圍繞德國邊境的各小國、如多腦河流域諸國、完全溝通、一致擁護凡爾賽和約、擁護國聯、還恐力量單薄、有够制服德國、所以又拉攏蘇聯加入國際聯盟、隱然有同盟之勢、由是國聯在歐洲的根基、更加鞏固、英國自然要與國聯表示一致了、所剩的問題、祇有對意關係、如果巴爾都不在馬賽遇刺、則送回猶哥國王之後、他就要去拜訪黑衣宰相、暢談這個問題、現在拉法爾繼任、還是很注意聯意工作、</p>
<p>歐洲大陸諸國、旣然都着意於保持現奘狀、德國卽不免於外交孤立、縱令一月十三日投票結果、德國勝利、所得也不過地面上的政治統治、要把鑛産收歸掌握、還須用現金收買、否則祇有用强力打破凡爾賽和約、纔有可能、但是外交上除波蘭對德情感略好以外、其餘各國、都不能引爲與國、况且法國照條約規定、還有開兵進薩爾的權利、現在且已凖備、德國的實力、無論在軍事上經濟上、都不足以應付戰爭、又不能運用國聯、結果最好的局面、恐怕還是由國聯繼續管理罷、（十二月一日於巴黎）</p>

<p>申報無線電週刊電源電壓低落之補救  庸言　　一架交流收音機在規定之電壓下使用，成績當然最爲滿意。普通在電壓低落十分之一時，大槪尙能照常工作。但是較此數更小時，就不免大受影響，甚至全無聲息。此種困難常爲内地交流收音機用户遇到，因内地發電廠所發電流之電壓每較規定數爲小也。此種電壓低落，當然可以用升高變壓器補救。但此種升高變壓器市上並無現成售品、必須向廠家定製，麻煩而不經濟，自不待言。今有一較簡省之法如下：　　詳細請看甲乙二圖。圖中丁爲電鈴變壓器；Ｐ爲其初級綫圈；Ｓ爲十二弗打一安培而在十，八，六，弗打處有分頭之次級綫圈。照甲圖在ＡＢ處所得之電壓約較電源電壓可增大十二弗打。乙圖則爲二十四弗打。至圖中之分綫器乃用以調節增大之電壓數者。　　在裝置時，電鈴變壓器初級圈之二綫頭，須換接試之；因若反接，則在ＡＢ處所得之電壓將更爲降低（故本法亦可用以降壓。）使用時，先將ＡＢ二頭接至收音機電源接綫釘上，然後再將撲落插入卽可。１２Ａ７複作用眞空管的試騐　　自ＫＭＫ君（以新式複作用眞空管１２Ａ７作單管次流機）一文在本刋登載後，余爲好奇心所驅使，急往購置該管。竟一二日之功，照樣製成。收聽本埠各大電臺，在揚聲器中發音甚佳，南京中央電臺，日夜能收聽，惟日間聲較弱。然成績亦不爲不佳矣。茲將各另件數值及眞空管座接綫法錄於左：　　ＬＬ２爲普通三回路綫圈，惟初級綫圈宜較多，Ｃ與Ｃ５爲·○○○四六ＭＦＤ變量電容器，較大則易收五百公尺至一千五百干週率廣播段，Ｃ２爲·○○○二五ＭＤＤ定量電容器，Ｃ４爲·○	○○一ＭＦＤ定量電容器，Ｃ３Ｃ６爲二ＭＦＤ	定量電容器，ＲＦＣ爲四十千分享利高週率阻流圈，ＲＩ爲二ＭＥＧ歐姆栅漏耗阻器，Ｒ２爲十萬歐姆可變耗阻器，ＡＦＣ爲三十享利三十千分安培成音週率阻流圈，燈座接綫見下圖。　　Ｉ爲２爲Ｉ２Ａ７燈絲接綫，３爲極五部份之屏極，４爲五極部份之簾栅極，５爲整流部份之陰極，６爲整流部份之屏極，７爲五極部份之陰極，８爲五極部份之控制栅極，虚綫所示爲該管之遮蔽子，此遮蔽子足以阻止整流部分及五極部份所發射之電子，不使相混雜，故此管能兼司二種，或二種以上之工作也。續談小型橡實眞空管之用途  ＫＭＫ　　上期本刋載有貽孫君著之（最新小型橡實眞空管）一文對於該眞空管之特性以及構造已詳述無遺。至於它的用途似乎尙未提及，故作者特將該眞空管之用途以及綫路介紹於左，以供愛好讀者之參考。　　際此科學萬能及萬物趨新的情勢下，無綫電在美國其發展之速率，殊堪令人敬佩，最近美國發明一種極小橡實眞空管，（又名新式矮形眞空管西文名爲Ｎｅｗ　Ｄｗａｒｆ　Ｔｕｂｅ）該眞空管在美國可謂已極普遍了。在我國却還沒有見到。　　該眞空管之絲極電壓用六·三弗打交流或直流皆適宜，其内部構造與２７，３７，５６，等相仿，只不過形式各異和需電的不同罷了，其形如圖一，在美國業餘研究界用該眞空管作一具一公尺超短波收音機，非但成績極爲優越而其體積之巧小玲瓏，在無綫電界可開一新記錄，其形如圖二，體積祗有三英吋，重量亦祗有半磅左右，故携帶極覺便利該眞空管不但使用於短波收音機能奏效上乘，就是使用於廣播收音機中亦能一鳴驚人也，圖三所示爲利用該眞空管作廣播收音機之一種，一級電子交連回授式檢波，一級成音週率低週疲擴大，用變量電容器Ｃ|串連而控制檢波眞空管之回授力，乙電壓擴大級（Ｂ十處）可用一百八十弗打，檢波級已由二○○○○歐姆電阻降低供給之，故檢波級可不必再另接乙電壓，其他另件數值圖三已有詳細註明，母須再贅：短波有那幾點須改良？  王輔民譯　　我們知道短波現在還是在幼年時代，有很多的地方我們還要努力去改良的，今將要改良的幾點略述於下：　　當然；最要緊的就是如何除去人造天電（Ｍａｎ－ｍａｄｅ　ｓｔａｔｉｃ）這一點在收短波的時候，是我們感到最大的困難。如電器用具，汽車，電車的經過等等、皆能發生呼鬧的聲音，以妨礙收音。雖然現在市上有一種引主綫呌做（Ｔｒａｎｓｐｏｓｉｔｉｏｎ　ｌθａｄ－ｉｎ　ｔｙｐｅ）的，稍微能够减少這些雜聲。但仍不能得着最好的效果，所以我以爲這問題的解决須在眞空管上，並且使用了一種特别的綫路，去免除這些人造的天電。　　如何補救衰落（Ｆａｄｉｎｇ）這也是一種很重要的一點，現在的收音機中，全有很多的眞空管，有自動音量控制。對這點也有相當的解决，但在天氣很壞的時候，卽使一多眞空管的收音機，對這問題也不能解决。有許多無綫電學者説；要解决這困難，祇要收音機的靈敏度比現在的更大，及自動音量控制的效力比現在的更强，在現在，靈敏的眞空管時時在製造出來，所以在這幾年中我們可想像，關於這方面的問題，一定可以解决。有時收外國的短波電台，也感到困難，甚至不能收到。這是關聯於上層的大氣層呌做海氏層（Ｈｅａｖｉｓｉｄｅ　Ｌａｙｅｒ）的。或者是因太陽上的斑點關係。天綫祇能受到很少的能力，收音是最壞的，並且或者收不到也難講。　　　這一點，無綫電工程師全多知道。外國政府每年費去幾百萬元去維持一大電力的短波電台。當然要能使很遠的聽衆皆能收到他們的音。假如某天有這種不幸情形發生時，那麽電台一定要用無綫電報或海底電報去通知各處，發射機須自動的接上較高的電力，以解除這些障礙。　　最後，卽自動波帶分離器（Ａｕｔｏｍａｔｉｃ　Ｂａｎｄｓｐｒｅａｄ）。在現在，有許多收音機，已經全裝了波帶分離器，但需手去管理，欲求便利，那麽非用自動的不可。超越之一管機  魏英　　此機雖僅一管，然其效力實勝過一般三管機。雖在上海電台林立之區，分隔極爲清楚，可與舶來五管機比美。不用天地綫可收南京中央廣播電台；至滬上各電台皆可放揚聲器，音量洪大，聲聞户外。本人曾自製一具，可收日本諸電台，成績頗爲滿意，茲特獻諸同志，敬求指正。　　此機之構造：由一級高放，檢波，一級低放組成。採用最新複式６Ｆ７眞空管|市價四元餘|名雖一管，實爲一三極管一五極管之合組物。今以五極管司高放，三極管司檢波，再以來復式輪入五極管作强力低放。故音程旣遠，音量亦極洪亮。而接棧極爲簡單，無一般來復式之麻煩，蓋以五極管司高放，無自生振蕩之弊，電源供給，交流直流皆爲適用：用交流時，則以初級２２０　Ｖｏｌｔｓ次級４，６，Ｉｏ　Ｖｏｌｔｓ而以６Ｖｏｌｔｓ之交流供給絲熱。用電池時，則以四隻甲電串聯，以供絲熱，且極爲經濟，以一管機之消費，得收三管機之效果，實爲自製收音機中，不可多得之佳品也！現示綫路圖於下：　　Ｖ　　６Ｆ７　　ＬＩ　十二圈　高週率變壓器　　　Ｌ２　六十圈　　Ｌ３　卅四圈　　Ｌ４　五十圈　三廻路綫圈　　Ｌ５　三十圈　　　Ｃ１　·ｏｏｏ４６ｍｔｄ　　Ｃ２　·ｏｏｏ４６ｍｔｄ　　Ｃ３　·ｏｏｏ２５ｍｆｄ　　　　Ｃ３Ｃ４Ｃ５Ｃ６·ｏｏＩ或·ｏｏ２　ｍｆｄ　　丙電　４·５Ｖｏｌｔｓ　　乙電　　ｃＶｏｌｔｓ　　甲電　接在有Ｘ處無綫電的道德問題  愼　　無綫電是一種大衆可以應用的科學器具，因爲是大衆應用的器具，所以必須彼此顧慮公益，這無綫電的道德問題，在這個無綫電應用廣大之時期中，却是一個必須注意的問題了。　　在一般的無綫電收音機中，經過了種種的實騐，知道收音機收音的效力最高的，莫過於再生式，一般收意機製造者，因爲要收音的效力高强，於是都趨向於再生式，市上出售的收音機，再生式亦不在少數，而自已製作和一般業餘家所裝置的收音機，亦十九是屬於再生式的，再生式的收音機，效力確較别式的收音機宏大，然而再生式有一個絕大的弊病，如果拿收音機上的再生盤旋動極快的時候，初級及次級二綫圈中的感應力發生巨大的影響，而隣近所有的收音機，亦受到影響的波及，發出巨大的呌聲，而且這是萬試萬騐，不論那種收音機都要影響的。　　在歐洲，德國的無綫電法上對於再生式的收音機是禁止的，祇有研究家能够享受再生式收音機應用的權利，德國市上所出售的收音機，沒有一架是再生式的，原因亦就是爲了避免妨礙他人的收音。紐約的市上，對於再生式收音機亦在禁例之内，不凖應用的，因爲大都會之中，每一所房屋中必然有機架收音機設備着。要每一家都沒有一人去旋轉再生盤，那是一件很困難的事情，這樣還不如規定再生式收音機在禁例之中的好。　　再生式收音機，再生盤不可用力旋轉，這是無綫電道德問題上最緊要的一件事據我的許多朋友告訴和我自已經騐上所得到的，上海不知有多少無綫電應用者忽視了這個道德問題！　　法國的無綫電收音機，一到了夜間十時以後，不凖再開放到室外能够聽到的響度，德國亦同樣規定在夜間十時之後必須開聽至隣室不能聽到，否則就違反定章，而隣室或警察廳可以向法院控訴妨礙罪的，英國對於無綫電收音機規定在夜間十一時必須沒有聲浪流出户外，否則亦以違法的處分，此外無綫電收音機在近街道的地方開放，亦爲德國及法國的警務機關所不許，而列入違禁的規程以内的，這些規程實在都是應用無綫電者所應遵守的道德。　　但是在上海，清夜開收音機的不勝其多、到處都可以聽到音樂歌唱和廣告的宣傳，我們希望使用者能够放尊重些，才好呢。小經騐  定觀　　利月廢眞空管要插入綫圈，欲將其四脚焊錫去掉，頗費手續，如用織絨綫的細鐵針，由裏面通入脚孔中，持向酒精燈或煤油燈上燒之，一面即將鐵針向外一推，則焊錫脱落而貫通矣。　　調節天綫廻路的小電容器，可用銅錢二枚，一梗釘子面，一枚嵌入如錢孔粗細的木棒之一頭，木棒另一頭貫穿面板與釘上的錢孔，然後以推拉調節電容量之大小，効用頗好。　　聽筒和揚聲器之引接斷綫時，有時不易查出其斷在何段，今以普通縫衣針一枚，橫貫引接綫之一點，再取乾電一節，一頭連聽筒或揚聲器之一脚，一頭向縫針碰之，則縫針分段移動，甚易將斷處查出，如斷在引接綫的上下部分，則尺要裁去一段。較全深條換過，便利許多矣。大容量紙質固定電容器之修理法  周文魏　　大容量固定電容器，在交流收音機中，必不可少，他的種類，有電糊式，電液式，紙質式等三種，而價格，以紙質式最賤，其功用，各有所長，普通舶來品收音機中，總以前二者爲多，絕少用紙質式，唯一般業餘家，往往因着經濟問題，總是去購廉物美的紙質式。而現在一般製造廠，往往偷工减料，所出的貨品，不甚耐用，（如商標上明明寫着，能耐５ｏｏＡ，但實騐上，用在Ｉｏｏ左右電壓上，已發生短路，變成廢物）。　　但這已壞的電容器，切勿抛棄，仍可利用。先拆去其外皮（即外邊的一層），然後小心地逐步拆到短路的地方（在拆時，注意錫薄二面的絕像物，不要損壞，）用剪刀剪去，再用膠水接合，照着原樣，重行繞好，放入白臘液中一煮，即成一個完好似新的新電容器了。　　附註：全部容量，雖略减小，但使用起來，並無二樣。　　蔡光華，貽孫，沈會周諸君鑒：十二月份來稿未附圖章，請卽補發，以便憑章照發稿費爲盼。　　　申報無綫電週刋部啟</p>

<p>自由談傳記文學在中國  白苧　　以偶然的機緣，從一家書店的廣告上，看到説沈從文著記丁玲一書是中國最完美的傳記文學，這裏暫不談此種論調是否可靠，先來説説我個人這幾名話所引起的另一感想。　　傳記文學，在歐洲是占有文學之重要部門的，如大家所知，法國羅曼羅蘭的托爾基泰傳米凱郎哲羅傳悲多汝傳是傳記文學，莫洛華（Ａ·Ｍａｕｒｏｉｓ）的雪萊傳拜輪傳，德國支魏（Ｓ·Ｚｗｅｉｇ）的羅曼羅蘭傳，嘉莎諾華（Ｃａｓａｎｏｖａ）傳，路德維喜的拿破崙傳，蓋司凱夫人（Ｍｒｓ·Ｇａｓｋｅｌｌ）的白朗蒂女士（Ｃｈａｒｌｏｔｔ。Ｂｒｏｎｔｅ）傳也都是傳記文學；至於盧騷的懺悔錄，歌德的詩與眞理，克魯泡特金的革命家自記，乃至許多回憶錄等，有的成爲連篇累牘的散文，有的則成爲小説，但與傳記文學相較，相去究意不十分遠的。　　給傳記學下個定義並不容易，牠是文學上的一種特殊形式，牠不同於歷史，歷史，無論是新代的編年的抑是取着其他形式，總是乾枯地記載某一時期某一領域中人類行爲的活動，而牠|傳記文學|却是以生動眞切的形象作爲某（個人）的生活紀錄來訴諸人們的感情。牠又不同於描寫典型人物的小説，不但因爲牠寫的對象是實際存在過的，並且也爲牠缺乏那種典型人物小説中的（象徵性）。所以叙述巴札洛夫，吉訶德的作品，只是小説，而非傳記文學。並且牠還有别於作家評傳，因爲評傳隸屬於文學批評，而它與文學批評並不相關，至於軼事傳説的寫作則僅僅是作者的一點Ｈｏｂｂｙ，縰使其中提供了不少的傳記文學的資料，但不能獨立成爲傳記文學。可是傳記文學始終不離文學的範疇，所以卽令其描寫的人物是越出（文學家）的境域之外，但在那思想感情是被組織於具體的事象中而被藝術的地表達出來這一點上，牠是與文學之其他形式沒有什麽兩樣的。不過在其搆成作品主題的人物上，卽作者描繪的對象上，不能説沒有從實生活中移到作品中的變形，因爲在表現的過程中，作者往往是有意七無意地將牠誇大或理想化主觀化了的。這當然也可在這種文學形式發生成長的歷史中求得解釋；卽，傳記文學在歐洲雖早已萌芽，而抽華吐萼則在十九世紀末葉，其形式之發展與培育此形式的資本主義社會繁榮期個人主義思想發展過程構成一定的紐帶。在英雄崇拜與個性萬能的思潮下，傳記文學得到牠發達的社會根據。　　這種文學形式在中國還很少看見，自五四運動以還，中國文學如小説戲劇詩歌等都能漸次擺脱舊有桎梏而匯爲世界文學之一支流，但傳記文學却始終付諸闕如。我現在要指出的是，如果我們的作家有意於嘗試這種形式的話，至少亦應像克魯泡特金作革命家自記那樣把個人作爲歷史進化機輪中的一枚小螺釘，籍這個人的陪襯而把周圍的時代社會作着廣調的描繪，爲某個個人而提起筆來是沒什麽意義的事，有那樣的精力，還是去從事描寫集團生活的或典型人物的小説吧！沒有感想的感想  陶哥　　提起筆來，想寫一篇小品文章；但是想想枯澀，想來想去，連題目也無從着筆，平常不想寫文章時，終覺得感想無窮，文思湧塞，現在當眞提起筆來，却禁不住逃之夭夭了，但是，想不出題目，就是一個很好的題目，因此我就寫下一個題目，呌做沒有感想。　　如果説眞的沒有感想吧，却又不盡然，因爲的確有不少的感想，但是這一類的感想實在要不得，不宜也不能寫出來，爲什麽要不得呢？我想不必説吧，爲付麽不必説，那就更不必説了，剩下來的感想，就祇有（今天天氣哈哈哈）之類，寫大　　有點不安，寫小題目又太那個。於是中庸之道，小題大做，最爲適宜。譬如説，寫蒼蠅吧，你便可以下一個結論説，（蒼蠅也是喜歡光明的呵，）那這篇文章，就算成功。　　但是問題是在，旣經有的感想不能寫，有的感想却想不出，爲什麽仍然要感而且想呢？擱筆算了，這就是一個問題呵　　我往常在各種刋物或是報紙底副刋上看到各式各樣的形式而同樣是内容空虚的小品文章，就像幾毛錢一聽的廉價餅干一樣，外邊看看倒還像樣，拆開來一看，實在沒有什麽東西可言，我終覺得爲什麽有這麽多的人來幹這無聊的工作，現在我才覺得這些作者和編者是該被願諒的，一邊是一只噬人的黑手，一邊是一條生活的鞭子，在這雙重的窒息之下，就祇有這些儘是要不得的文章了，所以，那些不必倚寫文爲生的人們，實在是比較幸福的。換片子啦！  王集叢　　幽默作家老舍在其（小坡的生日）中告訴我們：小朋友小坡在他的生日那天，到植物園去看了猴子和到電影院去看過影戲後，玩倦了，晚上睡着做了一個長萝；在萝中，他到了狼山，看見一個猴王，這猴王就是他的同學張秃子；接着便狼王派了八十萬大軍來打猴兒們，於是便映出了狼猴大戰的一幕，小坡也就帮張秃子們去抵抗狼兵，參加了這個大戰；正當狼兵四下攻來，小坡的木棍碎了，張秃子跨下的山羊也被狼咬去了，萬分危急的時候，小坡呌道：（張秃子！咱們怎麽辦呢？！）張秃子還掄着木棍，喊：　　（換片子啦！）　　（這樣一喊，忽然狼也沒有了，山也沒有了，樹也沒有了，張秃子也不是猴兒了，依然是張秃子。）　　一九三四年世界的銀幕上映出的是：（不景氣），（失業）。（備戰）·······等等令人害怕的片子，要是這些可怕的片子永遠演映下去，豈不把人嚇死？！所以，正在危急的時候，大家就學了張秃子的辦法，喊：　　（換片子啦！）　　果然靈騐，在大家這樣一喊之後，三十一日這天一下就飛過去了，一九三四年的舊日歷也被拿開，一九三五年的新日歷已經放在案頭了。　　朋友，看一九三五年的新片子吧！可是，你得留意，這新片子不一定比過去的舊片子可愛，也許是更可怕的，謹防嚇掉你的魂！　　怎樣辦呢？我們得請敎小朋友小坡||　　小坡在（換了可怕的片子）後，知道將來的戲更是可怕；但他並不畏懼，馬上又同着他的一批小朋友們到虎山去，從老虎家裏，從帮助老虎作惡的敎書匠糟老頭子的勢力下，把那個被他們强佔被他們麻醉的美女　了回來！　　如果我們不願永遠看那可怕的片子，要看好戲，那就只有努力除去構成那可怕的片子的原素，與人類中的老虎和糟老頭子打個你死我活！有了媳婦的兒子（下）  俞斯錦　　（兒子來的信，媳婦是托小木橋頭三先生拆看的，有一次，三先生告訴我，兒子有五元錢附給我。但我去問媳婦，她反張大了眼睛，説：信是有的，錢有什麽呢！你眞老了不想想。　得這末幾塊錢，養家也不够啦！　　（先生，我就是這天的在　兒子的老！）他咳嗽了，咳嗽把話噎住，同時二條極澄清的淚水順着鼻緣滲下，掉在衣襟上。　　（慢慢地説）。我倒了杯茶給他喝。　　（這次我病了，媳婦是沒有好好地給我吃過一次粥。我隔壁有個鳳洽嫂，他要好，盛了碗粥來給我，但我的媳婦就反着背駡：什麽賤丫頭！想得這老不死的家産，故意裝得要好些。　　（説來更氣呢！有一日晚上，我身熱得非常厲害，我打量我明天已不能在這個世界裏生存，我哭着，我很乏力地要求她：（媳婦，允許我最後一次吧，我不要阿鈞的錢，但請你給他個信，説我病得厲害）。她把頭側轉自已的脚，淡淡地説：你的兒子不是醫生！　　（喲，可憐喲，）他哭出聲音來了，連連把袖子揩眼睛。（先生，對不起的，你們是不要看我這種眼淚的，但我不能抑制住，我的心已破了呢！||呃，呃，我再説下去，天保佑的，沒給我死，但我總得把我這口氣出了才算！先生，我要寫信給兒子，我要他回來，我要·········哦，什麽呢，要兒子打媳婦總不肯！算了，我寫封信去駡駡也出些氣，兒子畢竟是我的，我可以駡他！　　（先生，你説是不？我要駡仓太肯聽老婆的話，||呃，呃，是的，我不再説了，已費了先生很多時光了，先生，就是這樣帮我寫：説我生了病，其餘不用説，只要駡，兒子，媳婦，好啦！駡得愈刺耳愈好，||哈，呵，勞先生的神了！）　　他又在掛着淚珠的灰黯的面上裝出一刹那苦笑，開着口，似乎還有很多的話要告訴我，但是沒有，只是端正着頭看我寫。歸家  陳福熙　　我又回到故鄉來了。　　坐在火車裏，心裏却有難言的的悲慟。等火車吼呌了一聲長長的氣笛後，我便把頭兒向車窗外望：望見巍峨的塔和古舊的城墻，我的嘴裏便不期然的呌起來：　　（呵，這便是我的家鄉呀）！　　離開老家，又差不多一年了。一年前的冬天，我也是帶着這樣憂鬰的心情回到故鄉的。正像和今天一樣：當我踏着故鄉的天野時，我的心漸漸的沈痛了。||　　每一次歸家，所給予我的，只有憂鬱，只有一種難言的不愉快。我不知道對於老家，爲什麽毫無依戀？雖然老家還住着我的嗣母，叔父，堂嫂，堂兄，可是，我一見他們，歸家的哀愁，就完完全全的黏上我的心頭。　　祖父在時，老家正是財丁興旺。那時候吃飯的人有兩桌多。園裏種的花卉，四季開得不斷的。到橘子紅時，採採有兩大籃，老祖父就依着人數分派，因爲人多，每個人最多吃到兩三個。那種在木香棚旁的桂花樹，有金桂和銀桂；在書房的小院子裏，海棠，芍藥，鬱金香，開得最好看。屋子是自家的，老祖父每到夏天，便僱人抹桐油，幾扇窗門，抹得像鏡子一樣亮。我家向來是望族，只要説舜堂橋陳，沒有一個不知道。但是老祖父死後，門庭一天天蕭條了，也許是家運壞，年年死人，除了我父親早年徒居他鄉，人丁還狠興旺，其他幾房，差不多女的做寡孀，男的做孤鰥了。所以現在，充滿於我老家的，只是沈沈的暮氣，那種暮氣，誰也覺得凄凉。　　因爲這，我就不願恒老家，每一次去，我總是沒有好的心緒。記得去冬回去，眼見大門已經斑駁陸離：園裏的桃樹，李樹，枇杷樹，橘子樹，統統都死了，甚至連一棵死了的樹身也不見；只見兩棵梧桐樹上，做滿了烏鴉的窩鳥在樹上，（呀呀）的呌。像梅花大的屢試不鳥糞，屙了一地。野桑樹上，擱着根晒衣竹，那竹竿上，晒着幾塊旗兒似的舊尿布。園裏全是枯黃的荒草，有幾隻狗躺在那裏打鼾。跑進堂屋，茶几和椅子，堆着東西，放得亂七八糟，在陽光裏，還可以看見一層薄薄的灰塵。一幅中堂畫，是我嗣父畫的，但是長久不裱，上軸和下軸都破了，且有無數的蛀孔······　　想到這些，我的心緒又像止水般的凝滯了。　　我提着手箱，走下車，出了車站，向着老家的路上走去。不知道我的脚，在這時，爲什麽走得格外遲緩，幾乎將地上的螞蟻都將踏死。　　到得家，我所見到的沒有比去年好，只有更壞。大門只剩一扇，還有一扇，據説是被賊子偷走了。嗣母呢，她更老了，看樣子，又瘦了許多。當我跑進堂屋時，我正見她老人家戴着老花眼鏡，低着頭，縫着一件棉衣。　　（媽！）我走近去呌她。　　（呵，炳！你來了？）　　她看見我，特别來得歡喜；在她枯癟的臉上堆上微笑了。她忙放下手下裏的活計，站起來，接我手裏的提箱，嘴裏又説：　　（午飯沒有吃過吧？）　　（喫過了，在火車裏吃過些牛肉和鷄蛋······）　　（那是不飽的，我給你盛飯來！）　　　飯和菜統搬來了，我只得胡亂吃些，肚子雖是餓，但不知怎的，我竟喫不完一碗飯。歸家是不愉快的，想起老祖父時的興旺，眞呌我受到了那種衰敗後的悲哀。蒼蠅（五）  意Pirandello作席滌塵譯　　斷命的路！絕壁對於醫生驚心動魄，生怕摔死了他，縱然事實上薩羅大這邊耐利在那邊籠着頭絡，引導騾子。　　從他們所走的絕壁之處，可以看見一片平原谿的廣大的山野都栽種着穀，橄欖和杏仁；一時稻根澄黃，一時這裏那裏點點焦黑，燒過野火。脚底下，可以望見海，一牌混濁的藍色。桑子柏樹，橄欖和稻子足都保住着終年的青　；杏仁樹的枝條已經變得稀少了。　　四周圍，廣大環繞的天底下，好像是一面（風幕）。但熱是難當，太陽裂石，時時，從塵積灰暗的仙人球籬笆那頭　來一聲蟬鳴，或者鵲噪，使得醫生騎的騾子堅起了朶。　　（壞騾子！壞騾子！醫生老老抱怨。　　爲要看好那對耳朶，他連眼睛裏的陽光也不注意；他任讓撑開的，綴着青邊的傘，靠在他的肩頭。　　（不要怕，先生，有我們在這裏，）托利西兄弟説了鼓動他。　　當眞，醫生自已並不怕，他不過想到孩子們。他得爲了那七個可憐的小東西不要傷了體膚。　　想到他分心，兩兄弟就對他講起壞年成來：大麥也荒，小麥也荒，豆子也荒；杏仁倒不同，他們把不定準，一年茂盛一年又希零；他們不説欖橄，雪是一開頭就把它們摧殘完了；他們對葡萄的收成也無可補救，因爲四鄉所有的葡萄都遭了　的災荒了。　　（快慰快慰！）醫生搖着頭不住説道。　　走了兩點鐘的路程，一切話都談盡了。路向前綿長筆直的伸展，上面厚厚　着白色的灰塵，騾的四蹄，兩農人的釘靴開始合奏起來。利奥拉一時不耐煩對自已呼起調兒來，於是馬上又停止了。他們沒有碰到一個人，原來所有的農人，在那個禮拜天，全上高頭村子裏去了，有些去做彌撒，有些去買東西，有些去尋樂兒。也許下面蒙臉利沙那裏，沒有人留在柴魯旁邊，要如他依舊活着，要孤獨無伴地死了。　　他們果眞見他單單一個人在下　在邪氣味惡臭的馬棚裏，一如　羅，耐到離開時的光景，直躺在草上：青黑色，浮腫龐大，認不得了。喉嚨裏癟　　落　落。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言　從婦女國年説到學生國貨年  樹深　　在最後一頁日曆中，民國二十三年已不知不覺的溜過去了。　　民國二十三年是所謂婦女國貨年，於是關於婦女要用國貨的應時文章，像雨後春筍般在各報上刋登出來；各都市裏也盛行着婦女國貨運動：像國貨時裝大會啊！國貨展覽會啊！然而婦女國貨年的結果是怎樣呢？可以説，簡直是成了個反比例；據海關登表，去年一月至十月，我國對外貿易入超額爲四億三千餘萬元，内中脂粉和玩具佔到三百多萬元，超過以前每年的進口額，試問這些脂粉豈不是完全都化在婦女身上嗎？　　婦女國貨年是過去了，給全國人士的祗是失望。今年是所謂學生國貨年，雖然，學生决不會像婦女般的需要購用外國貨，以爲不用外國貨不時髦，然而學生所用各種文具之中，外國貨也不在少數。　　大規模的文具商店不必説，小一點的十家倒有九家出售着非本國貨，尤其是在小學校的門口，擺上一個攤子，放上些剛筆鉛筆等類。據他們説，賣本國貨難以維持日常的開銷，而學生們只要能够用，價錢便宜。管他本國貨非本國貨：省下的錢不會買糖果吃，　　照理，學生是知識階級，受有相當學識的，决不會像許多無智識的婦女去購買外國貨，應該每個人都有用國貨的責任，不要再像婦女國貨年般令人失望，嘆息。　　現在，學生國貨年已開始了，我們希望着在年終的時候，給我們良好的消息，超優的成績。　　最後，還有一句話要説，婦女國貨年雖已過去了，但是不要以爲婦女購用國貨的責任已經卸除，每一個婦女應當去用非國貨，應該（有則改之，無則加勉）去補救以前的缺憾，去努力未來的工作。而學生們，更是目前的責職，務須盡力去幹，實事求是去幹，不可蹈婦女國貨年的覆轍。　歲獻  許席珍　　||寫在一九三五年的開端　　凄絕地走過了一條泥濘的小巷，我望見了蒼白而朦朧的太陽，像結核症患者底眼珠。　　心，便像窗前清供的水仙，冲淡了地開放了。　　想起朋友的小箋：　　（又一個新的年頭在開始了，自已也似乎有着一種東西在心的底部滋長||也許是這貧血社會的産物吧？不過我却並不想過分地去估量它；總之，這總是跟着新的年頭而來的一種新的禮物啊······）　　眞的，又一個新的年頭了啊，報紙上不又是印上了那麽多的紅字了嗎？不過生長在這三十年代的，每一個新的年頭也許是代表了一種新的不安，與新的恐怖的吧？可是這恐怖與不安是包含着一種對新的未來的懂憬，與一種新的决定的，它們鞭策着人去走那崎嶇的道路，像黃昏邊尋求下宿處的旅人。　　然而這旅程却是多麽悠長的一條啊，這一代的孩子，他們的青春却全都化在摸索中了呢，别一些人在花下陶醉的時候，他們却在饑餓的疑問號上面沈思|||到後來，便寠沈思都不允許了呢。　　新的年頭也許是可慶祝的吧，不過對我，它却祇是添加了一種新的苦難罷啦||顚跛地走着這走不完的泥路，到頭來，便祇能像一條垂死的老馬，流浪在原野的日光裏回憶那過去的險濤了||而，當一切都成了回憶的時候，剩下來的便還有什麽呢？　　(有一個時候，我行經荒蕪的原野，在茅屋前的陽光中，我看到了老年人底沈思與嘆息。在那楊花般衰白的髮絲上，在安置了無數的條紋的枯臉上，刻劃着的不是年與年底推移嗎？而包含在他那思索中的，誰知道有着多少的驚駭的回意呢？　　我迷失了路，我打算去向他問訊。可是我終於慢慢地打他面前經過了，我不忍去攪亂他底苦難的温習。）　　年份的書頁不斷翻過去，我們也有一天會失掉了在苦難中扎掙的力，而憇息在二月的陽光中反覆那哲學之思維的吧　　　每個新的年頭全代表了大海中的巨浪，生命的獨木舟傾跛地給打着，一個跟着一個，到最後，便給打成了碎片，無聲息地沈到一萬哩深的海底去了。　　可是沈下去，也許就是一個永久的安息呢。　　我靜靜地在陰慘的陽光下面走，聽着自已的足音，它，像時間的足音一樣的，一步步踐踏在泥濘的小徑上，啷噹地帶着鐐銬的聲音，一步一步地，近來，近來，像Ｆｒａｎｋａｎｓｔｅｎ底可怕的步子一樣。　　一絲恐懼通過了全身，簡直呌人難以忍耐般地，很很地揉着我底意象，心是重重地，也許有一天，它會從腔子裏落下去的吧？　　又下雨了，雨萎枯地打着蒼茫的街，轉過身，我便悄悄地走回小小的家了，她已在我們底小花瓶裏放上了二枝長長的鬱金香了猩紅像狂怒了的火熖，轉過身，她走向我||　　（你看，不好嗎？我買了這猩紅的鬱金香來點綴我們底新年了||你不和我説恭喜嗎？　　我微笑，走到桌邊，翻開新買來的日記簿，在第一頁的白上寫了一個題句：　　||新的年頭啊，你又創造了一種（新的戰慄）（Ｕｎ　Ｆｒｉｓｓｏｎ　Ｎｏｕｖｅａｎ）！區公所  老木　　區公所擠滿了一羣人，這是某天剛過午的時候。　　我先向諸君介紹，近來區公所每天門庭如市，這些來投訴的人們，有地主，有淘金者，他們都是爲着各式各樣的淘金糾紛案件。而區長，助理員以至辦事員，都被鬧昏了，警長幾乎每天得率領常備隊到各處鄉下彈壓淘金者挖掘田地。</p>
<p>Page 27</p>
<p>在調解處，區長坐在正中的藤椅上，兩旁對坐着地主與淘金者。　　（他們現在又來挖淘大角田。前一回是警長親到那裏才把他們勸散，但，田全被掘廢了。現在還要再來。區長！還成甚麽世界）？地主方面的一個像受了很大的衝動而成爲聲緊氣促的狀態説出來。（他們還要放蠻，連禾苗都把泥土來壓死。）　　（你們爲甚麽這樣無理？税田林塲，政府已有禁令佈告，難道你們還不知是犯法行爲？卽使······也該問良心，過得去，過不去）？區長向淘金者責問。（你們爲甚麽不向荒坡餘地去淘？）　　（是的，荒坡餘地淘過，都沒有，金子偏生在田裏，敎我們也沒法，雖然，見過告示，但是怕餓死，······我們還有一家老小都要吃？）　　（區長一定要懲罰他們）。　　（犯法應該受懲治，知道嗎）？區長説。　　（區長！天理良心，我們爲要養命，才淘金）　　（除了淘金，就不能謀生嗎？做工······人家幾多不淘金的，不見得都餓死。）　　（淘金就同做工一樣，可見我們並不是不願做工，但是找工作做，沒有僱主要，擔柴賣草也沒人家買，這樣長日子的五月，敎我們餓得幾天）？淘金方面説。（現在我們的金床金桶都被他們打爛了，區長！這些是我們的命，望區長主持公道，一定要他們賠償）。　　（我們的田，我們的禾，你們怎樣賠償）。　　區長沉吟子一會，性子有點火燥起來；　　（人家的税田，要輸糧納税，有法律保護，你們公然挖掘，你們賠了嗎？難道只有你們的金床金桶，是有特别法律保護的麽）？　　（但是那些是我們的命）。　　············　　明知這樣的糾紛是沒有解决的，於是區長只好拿出成法，（一拍兩散）的法子：　　（好！雙方不必多講，大家都散去。你們以後不得再淘税田）。書齋偶語  哲人　　談智識與觀念　　智識導源於對於客觀存在底認識，卽觀念底獲得；智識不是别的，只是觀念底聚集，分析，歸類，以發現其一船性與特殊性，由觀念聊繫的關係去發見事物運動底法則而已。所以智識底量依存於觀念底量，智識底質决定於觀念底質。要使我們底智識豐富正確，先要使觀念豐富正確，那麽來考察一下觀念獲得底過程也不會是多餘的事吧。　　觀念底獲得通常是由於經騐和書籍，其路綫是感覺與反省。我們由視覺神經對於白色的反應而獲得白底觀念，同樣由於感覺對於事物底廣延，性質，及運動等的反應而獲得三角形，香味，速度等等觀念；同時我們由反省獲得人底觀念，存在與實體底觀念，和一切其他較高級的複雜觀念。　　我們觀念底糢糊影響到智識底明確性，而我們觀念底零碎與不完備也同樣使我們底智識缺乏系統，然而這却是我們平常最容易犯的毛病。爲什麽我們會有糢糊的和零碎的觀念呢？一半由於先天的，官解上的缺陷，一半由於注意力底不能集中。一個生來就耳聾的人是永遠沒有辦法獲音階音色底觀念，因而也不會有音樂底智識的；如果能有音響底智識，他也是從書籍上獲得，重新把它背誦出來，不成其爲智識的智識。嚴格地説起來，一點沒有音底觀念的人，要使他去誦讀並記憶音樂槪論裏邊的定義原則之類，總是不可能的事吧？就是勉强地讀了，也不會懂得其意義的。那還能算是智識麽？至於生來就是近視眼的人，他對於星球和天體的觀念自然是非常糢糊甚至於不正確了，那樣人，隨便他讀了多少天文學的書，還是無法成爲天文學家的。可是，官能健全的人，如果注意力散漫，他對於一系統内的觀念便會忽略了許多，因此便缺少許多中間觀念，他的智識便不能不零碎，就是不零碎，也不能不糢湖了。這由其是從書籍上獲得智識時最容易發生的毛病。我們往往很隨便地讀書，對於書籍所提供的觀念不求瞭解，甚至完全不想記憶，到後來讀高深些的書籍的時候，對於内中的思想遂無法懂得者。　　除了這兩個錯誤以外，我們還有錯誤的記憶和錯誤的判斷二者足以歪曲我們的智識。我們時常因爲記憶的錯誤和判斷的錯誤，使毫無關係的觀念聯繫起來。偉大的思想家所以能發現眞理，就因爲他的記憶的清晰和判斷的明確，各種觀念都有正確的聯繫。一個人完全失去記憶和判斷力，他的觀念便非常古怪地聯繫起來，成爲瘋了。　　我們如果要使自已的觀念豐富正確，必需常常獲得新的觀念，時常集中注意力於觀念，培養記憶力和判斷力，使觀念排列於正確的系統内，並保持適當的關係。老了的心境  奚似　　（越來越感覺到蒼凉了，不老已老的心境啊！）近來時常莫明其妙自語自的這樣太息起來。又是一下子我又反問着：自已尙年輕的，爲什麽心靈感覺便這未闌珊呢？但我不能説是爲什麽的原故來，只是明白的自知我的心境是一天天的老了下來了。完全消失年輕人那種濃冽的戀依和興緻。　　因此我是拖着一個有着年輕的身子而又並不年輕的年老的心在蹣蹣跚跚地過着日子。　　爲了心境的黯淡，於是陳列在眼前的所有的人事所有的景物亦都罩上一層黯淡的顔色來了。由此我特别嗜好孤單聯寂的生活，往往一個人伶仃地終日兀守在小小的屋子裏，踱着方步，有時走近窗前，抬頭望着天上一朶朶的雲的影子，輕巧地描畫出各種美麗的圖案的姿態，靜默地凝視了半天，接近黃昏，這自然的景緻又是一番戀異了，夕陽曳疲倦的淡的時暉染紅了西天的一角，更鍍金了遠處的樹林。在此時，也許偶然從天空飛橫過了一羣歸鴉的黑影，沉里地擲下來一串凄凉的呌聲，在這凄凉的而又恬靜的黃昏中，沉動地落到了我的細微的神經里。等到黑夜的色全塗了下來之後，我才無言地關了窗。　　就是用了這樣寂寞的情調來陪伴着寂寞的心境，這樣寂寞地的渡了時日。　　我的心境眞的是老了啊。　　假如是不必踏出門，我可以用悠長的時間不出走這屋子裏，每天，自早及晚，看看天上的雲霞，看看日落時的晚景。情境雖然有點近似古刹裏般落漠，而我倒正神往於這樣落漠的却又幽雅靜美的境况。　　我寗願長長的日子關閉在小小的屋子里，讓無邊的寂寞鎖住着。讓寂寞像蟲似的在悄悄地囓噬着我的心靈，我不願意去混雜在人多的熱鬧的地方，因着旁人的笑而笑，因着旁人的愉樂而愉樂樂。尤其使我難堪的是當是聽到一種彷彿含着無限的關懷代我感嘆一樣似的説道：這些日子你又顯得老了啊！應該着休一下吧，當這樣的話傳進我的耳數的時候，我是一點悵觸也沒有。我的老了的心境他人是不能瞭解的呵！　　老了的時候，應該有着青年人所有的金色的夢，金色的理想如今是都沒有了，就連小到不能再小的希冀也沒有的。只是瞧着眼巴巴的瞧命運惡毒之神把我青春的花辨踐踏着，等着沒曾徇燦過的青春却已逐漸地謝萎下去。　　這樣地，用我老了的心境，沒了情感的遷延過歲月。看見黃葉蕭蕭下，我知道秋天來了，聽見鶯島在花叢間低語，我又知道是近着暮春了。每一個季候怱怱地來復怱怱地回去，可是這些跟找是全沒關係的，沒有春天也沒有秋天。　　我只有一個水遠死水似的打不起淪淡的老了的心境！妻的轉變  阿樂　　妻近來的能度，呌人眞難捉摸。有時好像蠻高興似的把幾年前我倆正在完全沉酣於熱愛的圈套的景象，重裑地談着，談着，最後，她便撲過來抱着我咬了一口，但有時又是那麽地沮喪，躺在床上，睡個整日，假如問她：　　（身體不舒服嗎）？　　她總是搖着頭説：　　（不會的）。　　（那怎麽整天睏呢？）　　（不睏若又什麽味兒？）　　（到外頭玩一玩吧，不要睏出病來）。我走過去坐在床沿上。　　她倒翻轉身，臉朝着裏面，拉着被頭蒙着頭説：　　（嘮嘮叨叨，要睏啦。）　　妻近來眞個變得很離奇了，扳着冷淡的面龐，是漸漸地多了，並且老是乘着我到公司去的時候，偷偷地獨自溜出外面去，問她到那兒去，她總是半呑半吐的，不是朋友從北方來，去會她一面，就是親戚來找她一起上影院去的這麽一些話，要是進一步問她的親戚姓什麽，朋友住在那兒，她便瞪着眼睛望着天花板，想了一會才説出來。　　今天又出去了。照着往早的規例，今天是特别的忙的，回來總要在晚上七八點左右，可是今天却是破了例，公司沒有那麽多的事情辦，所以我也就早一點回來。或許她還以爲正在埋頭辦公呢！　　我獨自坐在房子裏，有如坐在針毡上，心裏頭感到異樣地焦迫，一種難堪的恥辱，立刻浮上了腦際，氣忿地用手使勁地搥着檯子駡道：（媽媽的，吊男人的膀子去。）但立刻又後悔，詛咒着自已不該把自家的妻子，這樣地推測。無論如何她是不會厭棄我的，要是有厭棄我的今日，那就不會有當年那麽地熱愛我了。想到這一層，焦迫而又氣忿的心情，也不緩緩地鬆懈下去。　　可是，檯子上的座鐘的短針，飛快地跑上前去，天色也跟着黯淡了，但她還沒有回來。　　究竟到那兒去呢？我又重新停焦迫起來，剛才詛咒着自已不該把她那麽地推測着的念頭，此刻又動搖了。　　我猛憶起從她的衣袋或抽屜裏，總可以找到一些證據，於是我便打開了衣橱，在她的旗袍，小衫，亂摸了一會，拉出了抽屜，搜了一搜，終於空空地沒得一點綫索。　　就在這個時候，她進來了。她看見衣服零亂地丢在椅上，抽屜又打開着，聰明的她，隨卽就料到我的意思了。　　（幹嗎東搜西找呢）？她的臉孔，絲毫沒有一點好意。　　一股忿火升上我的心頭，隨手扔着她的旗袍，對凖她的臉擲去。　　她倒下床去，放聲號哭起來。無綫電播音節目特别節目　　青一口琴隊　　安定（八六○）下午二時至三時　　安琪兒（劉逸）自由射手（馬錦文）百樂門（李厚襄）第亞夫祿（葛朝社）威尼斯之街（二重奏）（周寰清馬錦文）金與銀（周寰清）漂浪詩人（劉逸）少年進行曲（葛朝社）卡門（沈廷華）銀色小琴（三重奏）（李厚襄沈廷華劉逸）　　金石古樂社國樂　　中西（一○四○）下午八時至八時三刻歌唱　　上海無綫電劇社　　永生（一○八○）下午四時半至五時半　　楊貴妃醉洒（曼娜）銀色的凄凉（露茜）特别快車（姚莉）吻着陶醉吧（曼娜）人間仙子（露茜）戀愛明星（姚莉）春潮回來吧（曼娜露茜）　　大中華（一一六○）下午八時至九時　　飛機上結婚（嚴斐）愛情是甚麽（姚莉）桃李刦（露茜）休息五分鐘（曼娜）飛花村之歌（姚莉）賣油條（露茜）小寳貝（曼娜）牧羊女（姚莉）夜花園裏（嚴斐）　　玫瑰團　　華興（一二六○）下午五時半至六時一刻　　桃花由（前奏）滿江紅（吳芳）努力周恭曼麗）特别快車（玲玲）丁香山（張如）春朝曲（雯仙）安慰（吳芳）　　敦本（八○○）下午六時三刻到七時半　　湖伴曲（前奏）我要你一切切（雯仙）人生幾回逢（張如）小小茉莉（曼麗）光明之路（吳芳）太平花（玲玲）南海美人（張如）　　明遠（九六○）下午八時至八時三刻　　好朋友來了（張如周恭玲玲王蝶）安慰（吳芳）擱樓上小姐（曼麗）人間仙子（雯仙）賣油條（曼麗）永别了弟弟（張如）粉紅色的夢（吳芳）　　中西（一○四○）下午八時三刻至九時半　　黑夜吹聲（前奏）張家姥姥（張如）風雨歸舟（曼麗）吹泡泡（雯仙）給摩登小姐（玲玲）警鐘（張如）紫羉蘭（吳芳）　　安定（八六○）下午十時至十一時　　第一次相見（前奏）樂哉樂哉（張如）桃李刦（楊曾恕曼麗玲玲）夜深深（吳芳）回憶（曼麗）新風陽花鼓（張如）賣報歌（雯仙）漂泊者（玲玲）　　大上海社　　大中華（一一六○）下午六時至七時　　夜來香（麗琳）叮叮當太太（白露音影）漁光曲（飛飛）我們的皇后（音影）賣油條（白露）醉臥沙塲（飛飛）　　夜鶯藝社　　國華（一二○○）下午九時至十時　　好妹妹（曼那）滿江紅（黛蕾）吹泡（露一一）春宵曲（魚華）農村之歌（曼娜）國難（露。）情伴（流朗黛蕾）彈詞　　　　姚小庵王萍秋珍珠塔　　中西（一○四○）上午十時至十一時　　開篇（春江花月夜）月圓花好上林春。花滿瑤台月滿城。但見那萬紫千紅花似錦。但見那廣寒宮殿月逾明。但見那月華如水節花影。但見那月季花開正月滿輪。有幾個南陌看花歌緩緩。有幾個西廂待月夜沉沉。有幾個花堦竚月臨風立。有幾個月殿裁花汲水噴最可笑月蝕萬家施救獲。最可羨百花生日去拜花神此刻是藥欄花發紅香煖待到那月國香飄桂露零要曉得春至人間花美色要曉得蟾華朗照月　雲。有一輩花枝招展沿門立有一輩種花引蜨過芳鄰我是尋芳和月把梅花拆有時間踏月鋤花閉院門。且去嗅花吟月度黃８昏。話劇　　觀音社　　中西（一○四○）下午七時一刻至八時　　（空谷蘭）　　紀蘭蓀回家的消息傳出了以後，杭州車站上有許多的代表歡迎他，他本想立刻到嘉興去一次，可是在車站上給的母親青柳夫人跟表妹拖住了，他在無辦法之下，祗好暫時回家。國學　　汪冰梅女士唐詩　　華興（一三六○）上午九時至十時　　登幽州　歌　　陳子昻　　前不見古人　　後不見來者。　　　念天地之悠悠　獨然而涕下！　　古意　　　　　李頎　　男兒事長征，少小幽燕客。賭勝馬蹄下由來輕七尺。殺人莫敢前，鬚如蝟毛礫。黃雲隴底白雲飛，未得報思不

<p>申報本埠增刊　電影專刊（新型人）難上鏡頭的理由　　　特點的凑合構成開末拉面型　　幻象的先入觀衆習尙受陶鎔　　一家公司裏開議了，七八位巨頭齊集在大會議廳上，那裏有廣長的議事檯，高背的大椅子，地上舖着厚厚的北京地毯。大家吸着雪茄，一個發言的時候幾個人交頭接耳閒談着。這樣他們把幾件例行公事處置了。忽然一個人起來提出了一個議案。那個議案是理由充足的。屢試屢騐的，永遠不會推翻的。但是那人却不須莊重其事的，等大家的閒談低了下去，洗耳敬聽的時候，才提高了喉嚨發言道：（我們這電影事業目前急需的，就是新型的面孔！）大家果然身子坐坐直，雪茄亦不抽了，表示對於這問題的十二分重視和贊成。不久他們又鬆懈了一些，重復交頭接耳，竊竊私語起來。但是尋覓新型人物的議案，終久一致通過了。　　怎樣去尋覓新型的人物，却就成了當前最重要的問題。當然電影界的巨頭，不能站在馬路上，從來來往往的行人中，去檢擇新型人物的。但是他們却都覺得一件東西旣值得要，就值得不遺餘力的去尋覓。於是周詳的計劃就此擬定了。計劃很多，而美女競賽，却是最普通，最有效力的一種，因爲除了選擇目的物的正項作用之外，還有許多副作用，如宣傳作用的可以轟動社會等等。於是他們就决定了採用美女競賽的途徑。各大城的報紙，都邀請了共同參加盛舉，它們的新聞主筆當然是樂於贊同的，因爲凡是關於婦女界的消息，他們知道一定可以哄動社會的。　　不久，一個新名單已經擬定了卜密絲堪薩斯城，密斯詩家谷等等，但是這次和以前所有的，微有不同。這一班小姐們的被選資格，除掉了不可不具的美色之外，還要具有一種特别的風韻，那個特别的風韻，就是所謂新型的面容而已。這一班具有新型的面容的美女，於是就在一天齊集在一個温暖的地帶。她們都穿着玲瓏緊俏的浴衣，一個一個嬝嬝婷婷，千嬌百媚。他們在大衆面前展覽了一回，就各人等到一張到好萊塢去的火車票，和一張影片公司的合同，上面載滿着螞蟻大的字，都是一條一條的條件，她們亦沒有工夫詳細去看。　　這一班美女，大家興高彩烈的結伴跑到好萊塢。影片公司的巨頭，於是一個一個加以一番詳細的檢閲。果然這次的挑選，是别具隻眼，不同凡響的。雖然其中有一個，遠看了有些像瓊克勞馥，但是他們想，以後一定會自行淘汰掉的，所以他們也就不在心上了。但是等到三個月的試騐期滿了之後，二十個新型的美女，倒有十九個不中用，而不得不給他們單程的火車票送他們回家的。惟有第二十號，平常的時候，稍爲有些像瓊克勞馥，但是在鏡頭前，她簡直就和瓊不分彼此。她被保留了，因爲她是上鏡頭的。其餘的比較起來，却比她美，身段亦比也的好，但是她們都不成。爲什麽？大家亦不願意去根究。好在黑白分明地她們都不興，還用得着什麽根究呢？　　據元説開末拉是個忠實的記者，但是不知如何，麗姐白晳的美比較愛娜黝色之美，當翻印在𤩀珞璐的時候，總覺明媚得多，雖然愛娜的本色，確係遠超乎麗姐之上。再則幾種面容上�特點合併起來，不一定是呌做美貌，但是却很容易上鏡頭。大大的眼睛，高高的顴骨，闊闊的額角，尖尖的下額，配襯起來却成功了一種開末拉面容。不過以上所説的，都還是一種空話，很難加以界説的，而最要緊的，比美貎還要要緊的，就是一種幻象，異國情調的幻象，健康的幻象，文雅的幻象，神秘的幻象等等。所以從前克拉拉寳有了ｉｔ的幻象，她就具有了電影榮名的寳鑰而不患不成功了。當然，幻象亦不是可以捉摸具體的東西。（未完）影片談評評（傾國傾城）  繼漢　　Ｏｌｅｏｐａｔｒａ－大光明　　西席地密耳！這一個銀壇的巨匠，在中國的觀衆心目中眞是太熟悉了。他以重厚的手法表現他的每一部戲。在他的影片中，有着偉大的塲面，衆多的人羣，沉重的空氣，處處都表現出他魄力的雄偉。這些從（羅宮春色）到這（傾國傾城），都表現出他獨特的作風。　　人們不會忘記，西席地密耳是宗敎的電影作家，同時也可以説他是歷史劇作家。從宗敎方面來説，一個服役於宗敎的作家，决不是偶然的嘗試，由於（十誡）（萬王之王）以及（羅宮春色）等等，都説明他是基督敎之忠實的傳道者。據説羅馬敎皇曾經給與他鉅量的金錢的賞賜，而且是在敎廷中很有榮位的。但是從另一方面解釋，他所以採取宗敎的題材未嘗不是他對於悲壯的故事，很有興趣，這從他製作的（現代青年）或這歷史劇的（傾國傾城）等作品，可以得着證明；因爲這中間都沒有宗敎的色彩。此外，還有略含諷刺意味的（蠻荒雙艷），也並不是爲宗敎説敎，雖然在作品中侵略殖民地的帝國主義的思想，頗爲濃厚。　　很明白的，西席地密耳的作品，沒有一部不表現他舊的觀念形態。在如今，他是應當被人們稱爲正人君子的。就這一作品來説，所謂歷史的叙述，在今日對於西席地密耳，當然有其作用存在。譬如説埃及女王克里柏德是要和羅馬王凱撒結婚，她希望在和平中埃及和羅馬相處，所謂埃及王的臣服羅馬的主張，在這裏是給譏諷了的。再就大將安東尼身上表現出和平的意義，他折矛以示决心。可是這裏却同時説明所謂激烈份子的進攻埃及的軍事行動，却破壞了所謂和平，而女王和安東尼因而殉國了。　　在各方面説，這一部電影相當地給與人們滿意的，偉大，崇高，還有女人的妖媚。不過在電影藝術上説，所謂作者的轉變作風，在古代史乘中插入現代的舞蹈，也不會不致於受人指斥的。然而話得説回來，當人們描寫古代史乘的時候，有如畫鬼一樣，有誰能决定那個鬼是畫得不像呢？評（鴛鴦譜）  尤兢　　“Ｃｏｌｌｅｇｅ　Ｒｈｙｔｈｍ”－國泰映　　（甜蜜華靡的歌），（狂歡嬌傻的笑），（美麗妙曼的女人，羅曼司），和别的足以用來點綴與供給忘懷地享樂這一九三五的新年的一切同樣，在這（鴛鴦譜）裏，被充份地應用着，號召着，受用着。自然，整個的世界在一九三四年内，動亂，驚險，憂悒，瘋狂地度過去了。雖然明知跟着這一九三五年到來的一切，或將更使人不愉快。可是在牠剛才開頭的這幾天内，權且撇開一切，變態地樂一個够，誰又能説什麽呢？因此，（海上行宮），（風流寡婦）以及這（鴛鴦譜）等，都點綴地用來應了時了。應了這東方大都市|上海|的元旦佳節。　　在我們隨着擁擠的高貴者羣看完這（鴛鴦譜）時，不免會感想到的，乃是這片子所表現的，有着無論怎樣用甜妙的歌樂，狂浪的嬉笑來掩蓋，以及男女間的性愛羅曼司來穿插，總是不可避免地在透露着這社會的本來的面目。如足球，以及别的各種運動也同樣地被這社會體制所僵化，而人去運動的原義，運動藝員化作了商品去作人家發財的工具，以及由於經濟恐慌，生産過剩，跟着勞苦大衆的生活貪困，消費購買力低到無可最低，所形成的商業不景氣中，無論所谓飽學之土怎樣用合理化的理論與手法來管理，來改革，也是（營業大衰）地，不得不用（擁有八十五千球迷的球員）來號召，以求畸形的（成績極好，營業大盛）等事實了。　　説到這片子的技術方面的成功，自然有着使我們不能抹殺的。從Ｃａｓｔｉｎｇ的適當地劃出的（用功書本的所謂學者）與（胸無實學的足球健將）兩個人物，到敵對的兩個大商店老闆的姿態，都恰當地達到了成功的境地。賽球塲，歡宴會，天商店開幕等大爲熟鬧的塲面中，空氣把握與音響效果的應用都極好。但是啦啦隊的着重地演出與商店内的許多節跳舞等，過多地誇張了，形成這片子全量上的不相稱。爲了熱鬧，就不惜過份地來注重某些塲面，原是一般沒有内容的許多好來塢影片的通病。所以（鴛鴦譜）中所謂熱鬧，也只是熱鬧而已。　　演員們在這樣的劇本中，總算多做到了該有的成績，其中以演賴利的Ｌａｎｎｙ　Ｒｏｓｓ的表演較深刻。所謂上海小姐Ｌｙｄａ　Ｒｏｂｅｒｔｉ　以丑角型在這兒出塲，並沒有多少足以稱賞的地方。　　聯美新片（海上行宮）爲甜姐兒耐賽卡路最成功作，不僅歌舞新奇情節尤勝。各國都認爲本年歌舞片之奇觀電影小説警吏乘龍（White　Lies）（一）  信之　　美國哥倫比亞出品　費蕾　維克多佐利等主演　　約翰弗蘭克密契爾，大家都稱他（封面密契爾）的，是美國西岸的報界巨孹。他勢力廣闊，胆識兼人，可説得是個無冕帝王。這時他正在他宮殿式的住宅裏的書室中喝著咖啡。一杯咖啡還沒有喝，他對着電話筒咆哮着道：（我不管他有什麽勞績！我要你將那傢伙開除||你聽見了嗎？那種警察大豈有此理了||想拘捕我，説我開得太快了||等到告訴了他我是誰，他都不管。他的名字嗎？不是我已經告訴過你的嗎||泰萊康登。不錯的，我要你將他開差，越快越好。好極了。）他説完了，用力將電話聽筒掛上，他的眼睛也閃爍地冒着兇燄。　　在桌子的那一頭，他的女兒呌瓊的，正擱起了一隻絲光緻緻的長腿搖曳着。她微笑地看着她父親發火，照事實上説，在她父親面前可以説幾句話，而不戰戰兢兢的，亦祇有她一個人。現在又到了她説話的時候了。她聽了她父親的話，雖然不知道這泰萊康登是誰，但是他敢在他父親面前這等放肆，她倒有些佩服他的胆量起來。她想起來了他父親居然會受一個警察的閒氣，又不覺暗暗好笑。她轉了一個念頭，於是就開口向她父親説道：（爸爸，説來很可笑的，好像警察廳是爲你個人而設的，你要怎麽便怎麽，動不動就要開人家的差。一個警察算不了什麽，但是你將來不想想，倘使你本來要開他的差的你倒升他一級，你看，事情不就兩樣了嗎？就提起這個泰萊康登來説吧······）　　　密契爾不等她説完，就哼了一聲，揮了一揮手，呌她不用説了。但是她的女兒却毫不畏懼地繼續着説道：警方説，你本來要開他的差的。你和總監説一聲，説他辦事得力，升他一個三道頭，這不是你又多提拔一個人，多擴充了一點勢力嗎？那個警察一定是很有胆量的。像爸爸這樣一個赫赫有名的人，都嚇不住他。你亦是地方上一個公正的紳士，你應當贊成這種奉公守法的人。你倘使這樣表示一下，不是大家更佩服你了嗎？）密契爾聽了，不耐煩似的喊道：（好了，好了。我活到這麽大，都沒有受過人家的敎訓，現在用得着你來和我講道理嗎？况且我辦報成功到現在，差不多已經二十年，我亦不用現在你來勸告我呀。）瓊聽了她父親的話，聳了聳肩膀，立起身來説着：（爸爸的話是不錯的。我那兒敢來敎訓爸爸呢？不過你要是不帮忙那個人的話，我恐怕你將來要後悔的。好吧，我現在還有一個約會。我要去換衣服去。再見吧。）她説完了，嬝嬝婷婷地走了。　　他的女兒走了之後，密契爾半天愁眉不展地，向着空中深思着。忽然他臉上的縐紋舒展開來了。他漸漸微笑起來了。終於他格格地笑了起來。他一面去抓電話筒，一面笑道：（這孩子有些道理······）他説着，已經將電話筒抓了起來，於是就對着電話道：（接警察總監···哈囉，總監？又是我||密契爾。哈，聽着。我現在氣消了。哈，哈，哈，哈。不錯，不錯。我想回來了。那個警察，康登|他拘我拘得有理|這人有胆量||辦事不阿附權勢公正守法|應當升他一下子。不錯，不錯。謝謝。哈，你升了他，呌他有空到我這裏來走動走動······哈···哈···）（未完）</p>

Mr. McReynolds' intention is to build a building to house the consulate, the commercial counselor's office, the Treasury Department's office, and experts from the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Commerce stationed in Shanghai. It is said that the design of the new building has been approved by the State Department. If Congress allocates funds for construction, construction can begin. The construction cost is estimated to be approximately US$750,000. Currently, the only reason some members of Congress oppose the allocation of funds is whether or not it is appropriate to engage in large-scale construction abroad at a time when domestic unemployment is so severe.

<h3 id="e54">The Trend of Commercial Warfare Among the Powers in the Pacific Ocean · Su <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Since Japan formally notified the Washington authorities on the 29th of last month of the abolishment of the Washington Treaty signed on February 6, 1922, the contradictions among the powers in the Pacific Ocean have obviously become increasingly fierce. In terms of military affairs, there is a white-hot escalation of the arms race. In terms of commerce, there is a sharp intensification of market competition. Both have clear evidence. And the intensity of market competition has no room for concealment. According to the National News Agency's Washington telegram on the 18th of last month, more than 100 US industrial groups are organizing a Far East Economic Survey Team, planning to depart westward after March. At the same time, the Domei News Agency's Tokyo telegram also mentioned that Japan will organize a China market survey team this April. The London Naval Conference had just broken down. Japan and the United States immediately took our country's market as the object of further study. What is the meaning? It is not difficult to infer. The commercial war in the Pacific Ocean is inherently intertwined with the arms expansion of the powers. Regardless of who wins or loses in the future, China will inevitably be the sacrifice. There is no doubt about it.</p>
<p>Since the powers' commercial war in the Pacific Ocean takes China as the main target, measuring the rise and fall of their commercial power in the Pacific Ocean by the changes in the trade relations between the powers and China will not be far off the mark. Let us first talk about the competition between the United States and Japan. Since the fall of our country's Northeast, Japan's power in the Pacific Ocean has increased sharply. Therefore, Japan regards the puppet Manchukuo as its private property, unwilling to let others interfere. Judging from the repeated reforms of the ruling organs in (Manchuria), one can see the traces of its deep-seated intentions. The United States, in view of the closure of the Manchurian door, cannot help but feel indignant. Japan, in view of the progress of US-China trade, is also deeply jealous and is eager to exclude it. For example, in the first ten months of last year, the total value of our country's import trade was 882,000,000 yuan, of which 103,000,000 yuan were imported from Japan, while imports from the United States reached 233,000,000 yuan. The ratio between the United States and Japan is two to one. The opposition between the United States and Japan is evidenced by these cold figures. No wonder each has organized a survey team to seek active competition.</p>
<p>Moreover, today's commercial war among the powers in the Pacific Ocean is not just centered on US-Japan competition. The conflict between British and Japanese textile sales is also a prominent phenomenon. And the irreconcilability of British and American commercial interests is also obvious to all. Before the Great War, Britain had long held the leadership of Far East commerce. The United States was a late bloomer, rising during the European War. Afterwards, whether in the European or Far Eastern market, it became a formidable enemy of the British. Britain's eagerness to restore its pre-war position is not a day or two. However, due to the situation, it clearly suffers from a lack of strength despite its intentions. Taking the British trade with China in recent years as an example, its volume is only able to barely match that of Japan, and it is not enough to compete with the United States. Now the US Far East Survey Team is about to follow the British Survey Team to Manchuria. How could the British not feel that they are being pushed too hard?</p>
<p>The powers regard competition for Pacific commerce as a way to solve overproduction. And this kind of competition will continue to be an element in future Pacific international relations. It is also an established situation. China holds the center of gravity in the Far East. If it does not want to be devastated by the powers' commercial warfare, it must rely on self-defense, and even more on the rapid cooperation of the entire nation to respond to it.</p>

<p>Discussing China Policy</p>
<p>(Dalian) At 2:00 AM this morning, the Kwantung Army convened a Kwantung Army staff meeting at Xingpu Xingzhi House, gathering Vice Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army Shu Kan, Special Organ Chief Doihara, Section Chief Ishimoto, Section Chief Harada, Staff Officer Kono (Supreme Advisor to the Military and Political Department of Manchukuo), Colonel Sasaki, Special Organ Chief of Shanhaiguan, Colonel Iga stationed in Jinan, Lieutenant Colonel Hanatani stationed in Shanghai, Lieutenant Colonel Kagesa, and military attaches stationed in Ping. The meeting held important consultations on the after-measures of the ceasefire agreement. Its main objective is different from that of the Tanaka Cabinet at the time. It takes the ceasefire agreement as the center and re-examines China's policies, perhaps even clarifying a firm and unshakable policy. The meeting will continue on the 5th, so it is worth noting.

<p>Japan Should Be Fully Responsible for Abolishing the Naval Treaty</p>
<p>Yamamoto Prepares to Return Home</p>
<p>(London) Major newspapers here believe that Japan should be held responsible for the end of this naval treaty. They also say that in the future, the UK and the US should adopt a consistent and cooperative approach to the Far East policy. According to a review by the Times, Japan's announcement of the abolishment of the treaty is not surprising, as the world has seen it. According to the newspaper, it is tantamount to rejecting millions of people from thousands of miles away, and in fact Japan should not use coercive means to take from its neighbors. Western countries may not be able to allow it to implement its so-called Greater East Asia Doctrine, and Japan has long been aware of the firm attitude of US President Roosevelt. According to the Daily Telegraph, Japan's (Manchukuo) policy and its questionable policy towards China are the major obstacles to naval issues. According to the Morning Post, Japan's abolishment of the treaty is to promote further unity between the UK and the US. (2nd National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The Naval Preparatory Conference has come to an end. At the same time, representative Yamamoto decided to return home. However, since Foreign Minister Shigemitsu has not yet returned to London, it is not convenient to decide on the future negotiation policy. Therefore, he is waiting for Foreign Minister Shigemitsu to return next week to discuss and negotiate about the renegotiations and other diplomatic cases, and then he can decide the date of his departure to return home.

<p>The Scale is Unprecedented</p>
<p>Japan Believes It is a Coincidence</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The US Navy, according to its established policy, will conduct naval exercises in the large triangle formed by Alaska, San Diego, and Hawaii from January to March of this year. According to recent announcements from the General Staff Headquarters, the Japanese Navy, also according to its established plan, will conduct large-scale exercises in the North Pacific from July to October of this year. The required funding is 6 million yen. 190 warships and 200 aircraft will participate. The exercise area will be in the Kuril Islands, Hokkaido, and Sakhalin area. It is a defensive and offensive exercise that includes land defense. The scale is unprecedented. The air force is based in the large Zhenxin Air Force unit. The Hokkaido naval air base, which the naval authorities are currently building, will also be fully utilized. In February of this year, the entire fleet will gather in Ariake Bay, Kyushu, and after being inspected by Commander of the Combined Fleet Vice Admiral Takahashi, it will be dispersed to various bases to prepare for the exercises. Then, in July, it will gather again outside Tokyo Bay. The entire fleet will be divided into red and white armies and then head to the destination in the North Pacific. The Japanese Navy conducted exercises in the South Pacific Mandate Territory in 1933 and in the Chinese Sea in 1934. This year is the third exercise. A spokesperson for the Navy Department said that the Navy fleet had gained experience in tropical regions during exercises in the South Pacific. This time, training in the Arctic region is intended to learn about the impact of cold regions on the Navy. This exercise was planned two years ago. It is a coincidence that the navies of Japan and the United States are conducting exercises in adjacent areas of the North Pacific one after another. (3rd Jiji Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e59">Japan Engages in Large-Scale Harbor Construction on Palau Island <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>League of Nations Committee Issues Report</p>
<p>Japanese Response Ultimately Fails to Alleviate Suspicion</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Mandates Commission today issued a report on its October and November meetings, stating that the Committee has paid considerable attention to the statement made by the Japanese Ambassador to Switzerland Ito that Japan's construction of ports in the Pacific Islands under its mandate, costing huge sums of money, is purely for civilian and commercial purposes. In the Committee's view, the size of this expense is not commensurate with the amount of commerce there. The Committee will elaborate on more details about this matter in its next report. During the discussion, Swiss representative La Bad cited the fact that Japan spent 150,000 yen to build a new pier on Saipan Island, 215,000 yen to build a shipyard in Palau Port, and 115,000 yen to build a mooring pier in Rota Port, and questioned Japanese representative Ito. La Bad also criticized Japan's subsidy of 689,000 yen for shipping, saying that the Pacific Islands are not rich, but Japan is engaging in large-scale construction here, which is puzzling. And the shipping subsidy exceeds 10 percent of the budget. If there are not many passengers and cargo coming and going, and huge subsidies have to be given, then why spend huge sums of money to build harbors due to the relationship of passenger and cargo traffic? Ito replied that harbor construction is indeed necessary because the existing ports cannot accommodate larger ships. Committee Chairman Shaw Du Li said that he knew that the Japanese were skilled in navigation, and he had never heard that smaller Japanese ships were not suitable for navigation. All these facts are enough to make people suspicious about the purpose of Japan's large-scale harbor construction. Since Japan has accepted the obligation of mandate, it should explain everything to dispel the Committee's concerns. British representative Lukard asked if the trade balance of the Pacific Islands provides Japan with an annual income of 7 million yen. Ito replied, "Indeed." Portuguese representative Garcia said that the economic life of the Mandate Territory being able to balance income and expenditure is the glory of the Mandate Nation. The report concludes that the committee hopes to adopt appropriate methods to seek the welfare of the native people. According to the Versailles Treaty, the islands in the North Pacific north of the equator, formerly owned by Germany, were reassigned to Japanese mandate. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) Australia and New Zealand are actively improving their defenses after Sir Hankey, Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence, visited. According to a Reuters dispatch from Wellington, in order to facilitate the government's policy of strengthening New Zealand's defense, Lieutenant General Paget, Chief of the Army Staff, has agreed to extend his term for two years. Defense Minister Corbett announced today that local defenses have been renovated in many ways, and further measures will continue to be taken in the near future. However, Corbett denied the rumor that New Zealand intends to implement compulsory military service. According to a dispatch from Melbourne, the Australian government plans to implement Sir Hankey's ten-year arms reorganization proposal immediately. Because the railway gauges within the country are inconsistent, which is inconvenient for troop mobilization, it was decided to raise 20 million pounds to start unifying the railway gauges as soon as possible, and this measure can also reduce the number of unemployed people.

<p>Promoting Lasting Friendship Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>Establishing a Foundation for Peace in Central Europe</p>
<p>(Paris) French Foreign Minister Laval took the Paris-Rome express train to Italy at 8:20 last night amid cheers of "Long live France" and "Long live Italy." The ambassadors of the Czech Republic, Greece, and Southern countries stationed in France, and some Italian expatriates came to see him off. After arriving in Rome, Mr. Laval will visit the Pope as a French cabinet member. This is the first official visit since the separation of politics and religion in France in 1905. There are still some points regarding the African colonial affairs that have not been resolved, but they are expected to be resolved. As for the main issue of ensuring peace in Central Europe through international cooperation, France and Italy have reached full agreement. Now the authorities of the two countries will begin negotiations based on this concept, which will take several months. Therefore, apart from the colonial issue, the Rome agreement will be limited to a written description by France and Italy of their common attitude of aiming at joint action. However, this level is extremely important, because the disputes between France and Italy can be put to rest from now on, and the rapprochement between France and Italy, and between Italy, Romania, Czech and South countries can also be promoted by this.

<p>(Rome) French Foreign Minister Laval, accompanied by the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Director of African Affairs, arrived here at 7:50 PM today and will begin political talks on Saturday morning. First, he will visit Prime Minister Mussolini at the Venice Palace, then meet with Deputy Foreign Minister Suvi. On the same evening, Mussolini will host a banquet to welcome Laval. Talks will continue on Sunday morning. At noon, the Governor of Rome Province will host a banquet for the French VIPs at the Pantheon. In the evening, French Ambassador Champelan and his wife will hold a banquet at the embassy to welcome Laval. On Monday, Mr. Laval will visit the Vatican to pay a visit to the Pope and visit the elders of the Holy See. In the evening, he will go to the Rome National Opera House to listen to music. He is scheduled to start his return trip to France at noon on Tuesday. (4th Havas Dispatch)</p>

I am pleased to see that all governments have the same sense of responsibility. I am convinced that the work undertaken by me and the Italian Prime Minister will lead to rapprochement in all aspects. To ensure peace, cooperation in all aspects is indispensable. Preliminary negotiations are very complicated, but they are always friendly." (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Rome) It was officially announced here today that Prime Minister Mussolini and French Foreign Minister Laval are now planning to expand the scope of the Four-Power Pact to guarantee the independence of Austria so that the Little Entente and the Soviet Union can also join. According to those familiar with the inside story, this treaty not only guarantees the independence and autonomy of Austria, but has deep meaning. If we refer to the map and consider the countries concerned, it is not difficult to understand. After the conclusion of this treaty between Italy and France, not only can it maintain the balance of power on the European continent, but it can also protect absolute power and prevent Germany from taking any special action.

<p>(Paris) According to a Roman dispatch from the Morning Post, before French Foreign Minister Laval left Paris for Italy today, he had made some concessions on the issue of treaty revision. It is said that this concession is that one side of the future signatories of the convention will not announce the perpetual maintenance of the Central European border stipulated by the Treaty of Versailles, while agreeing not to change the current borders by force. The Morning Post said that this method can eliminate the coercive atmosphere of those who advocate treaty revision and can be a compromise plan that can be accepted by Hungary.

<p>(London) According to British observers, the negotiations conducted by France on the issue of Austrian territorial integrity and the Eastern European mutual assistance pact are all centered on the issue of German armaments. It is generally hoped that French Foreign Minister Laval will be able to resolve this major issue when he holds talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in the near future. The British believe that the result of Laval's trip to Rome will further determine the consensus of all countries on safeguarding Austrian territorial integrity and stabilizing the situation in Eastern Europe. However, German cooperation is necessary for the Austrian and Eastern European issues. If German cooperation is desired, then it is necessary to reopen the files on the issue of German armaments. In Britain, it is advocated that Germany's rearmament should be attached to two conditions, namely (1) Germany returning to Geneva and (2) concluding a convention to provide security guarantees to all signatory countries. In addition, there is the issue of monitoring arms sales and manufacturing. Due to the urging of the United States, it is expected to be brought up for discussion as well. Regarding this matter, US Secretary of State Hull proposed a plan on November 20 of last year (proposed by US representative Wilson at the meeting of the bureau of the Disarmament Conference), advocating that the production volume of both private and national arms manufacturers should be made public, as should the import and export of arms. This publication document should be sent to the permanent central agency in Geneva for detailed review and publication. When necessary, governments can be consulted and whether their reports are accurate can be monitored. In addition, the US plan also stipulates a gradual and progressive elimination system. It is now reported that the British Foreign Office will propose another plan, which may be even more advanced than the US plan. If so, the United Kingdom and the United States will form a united front on the issue of arms monitoring, so that the proposals of the two countries can be quickly submitted for discussion in Geneva.

Yeftich personally read the cabinet's policy declaration, stating that the foreign policy adopted by the late King Alexander has made Yugoslavia's prestige known throughout the world and established friendly and allied neighboring countries, all of whom treat it with courtesy and sincerity. The current government will follow in his footsteps without any deviation. The Southern Country has suffered from terrorism and conspiracies for many years, and it has now decided to no longer accept sacrifices. This is only natural and reasonable, and no one can criticize it. (Regarding the Marseille assassination, the League of Nations Executive Council adopted several decisions in November last year to safeguard peace and maintain good relations between nations, and the resolutions of the League of Nations must be faithfully implemented.) Yeftich continued to address domestic issues, saying that any political party that cooperates with the government based on the spirit of the late King Alexander will be welcomed. Government measures will strictly adhere to the scope of the law, and all people will be treated equally. He will also reform the administrative organs to make the provinces autonomous units and strive to achieve a complete decentralization system. In terms of finance, he will restore budget balance and stabilize the currency. As for the army, its function is to maintain peace and guarantee security. The defense of national honor and the respect for international treaties all depend on the military, and he will pay special attention to it. The House of Representatives applauded Yeftich's declaration, and the section on domestic affairs made a particularly deep impression on the Parliament. (Havas Telegram, 3rd)</p>

<p>Consolidating the Domestic Front by Using the Saar Issue</p>
<p>(Berlin) In recent days, there have been unfavorable news reports from foreign countries regarding the situation of German domestic affairs. This afternoon, Hitler suddenly ordered a grand gathering to be held in the opera house on (Unter den Linden) Street to publicly demonstrate the internal unity of the National Socialist Party, the harmony of opinions between the government, the National Defense Force, and the Party Army organizations, in order to dispel rumors. Hitler himself, regardless of cabinet member Hess and Prussian Prime Minister Göring, delivered speeches one after another. National Defense Force generals, local governors, police chiefs, and security team captains all rushed to participate by plane. The opera house was surrounded by security team members guarding it to maintain order. (Havas Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German leader Hitler, Prussian Prime Minister Göring, and Deputy Leader Hess will all attend the grand gathering at the National Theater this afternoon to show the complete unity of the cabinet and the National Socialist Party. The leaders of the National Socialist Party and the secret police chiefs from all over the country have been invited to participate in this meeting. This meeting was hastily convened, and many people who were on vacation were recalled. From 3:00 PM to midnight today, airplanes are not allowed to fly over the capital. Postal airplanes are taking detours.</p>
<p>Starting at 1:50 PM today, tens of thousands of stormtroopers and black guards were lined up along the road from the leader's mansion to the National Theater. Hundreds of police officers were clearing the streets. Cars are not allowed to park along the route that Hitler passes through. The public still does not know the nature of this gathering. The meeting is expected to last for several hours. It is said that Göring will read the declaration on behalf of Hitler, and Hitler will personally deliver a speech. The aim of this meeting is to show the unity of the National Socialist Party to the world. (Reuters Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) This afternoon, Hitler gave a speech at the grand gathering at the National Theater, saying that the rumors from foreign countries about the overall situation in Germany are all lies. He then said that the Saar compatriots should return urgently, because it is especially worthwhile to do so now. Finally, he reiterated the words he made when meeting with foreign guests on New Year's Day, that is, he is willing to be sincere and trustworthy this year. This gathering was held because of the rumors from foreign countries in recent weeks that the German domestic situation was unstable, with countless arrests and other rumors that harmed Germany's interests. The intention was to shake the Saar plebiscite. Therefore, it was used to show that the leaders of the German armed forces and the National Socialist Party itself were united. The gathering lasted for an hour and then dispersed. Afterwards, a communique was issued stating that the grand gathering had eliminated all kinds of rumors. The only thing that the rumormongers gained was the expression of Germany's sincerity and unity. This kind of scene was unprecedented. Hess delivered the opening remarks, sincerely stating that all those present were loyal to Hitler. Then, Prussian Prime Minister Göring congratulated Hitler on the New Year on behalf of the audience.

<p>(Washington) The US Congress opened today. Astute political observers here predict that President Roosevelt will control the majority of bills in this Congress. The proposers of the inflation bill and the 30-hour work week bill admitted this afternoon that they have no hope of success, because the first action of the House of Representatives will be to pass a procedural law stipulating that any bill must have the joint signature of 218 members before it can be put to discussion. Previously, only 145 people were required. The Veterans' Benefits Act is at the top of the agenda, and congressional leaders have promised to vote on the bill soon. House Minority Leader Snell declared that his party does not want to obstruct the President's plan. In that case, the government's recovery movement can move forward unhindered. Representative Vincent suggested organizing a committee to study and report on the possibility of digging a canal in Nicaragua. President Roosevelt will deliver his annual administrative report to a joint session of the Senate and House of Representatives at 12:30 PM on Friday. The White House has stated today that the President will attend in person. (National Telegram, 3rd)</p>

<p>Orange. President Roosevelt's wife wrote to the court here on White House stationery, requesting a postponement of her son's trial. Prosecutor Doolens made this letter public today. The prosecutor said that he had received many letters from the outside world, all requesting that Roosevelt's son be punished because his car had repeatedly sped illegally. He also hit Mrs. Vorlee, who will sue the court and file a private lawsuit, demanding compensation of $25,000. Roosevelt's son had another accident recently during the New Year. The car he was driving crashed into a car parked on the side of the road and seriously injured the owner of the car, Newman. The prosecutor also said that he had granted Mrs. Roosevelt's request to postpone the trial until after Christmas so that Roosevelt's son could enjoy the holiday. (National Telegram, 3rd)</p>

<p>New York Cotton. The cotton market opened, and trading was sluggish. Merchants want to wait for developments in Washington. Interest is weak, and prices have not changed much. It is said that the US Cotton Storage Agency is now listening to the opinions of the host to promote its cotton without notifying the industry. Therefore, cotton market speculators are discouraged.</p>

<p>Abyssinian Government Asks League of Nations to Handle</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Geneva League of Nations Secretariat received a telegram from the Abyssinian government, requesting the League of Nations Secretariat to convene a meeting of the Executive Council to consider the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia. The telegram stated that Italian troops are now gathered in the Zhelogubi area and attacked the Abyssinian defense forces there on December 28, killing two people and wounding two others. Italian planes are soaring in the area, and tanks are also maneuvering nearby. Therefore, the Abyssinian government, in accordance with Article 11 of the League of Nations Covenant, requests that measures be taken to safeguard peace immediately. After receiving this telegram, Geneva felt like a bolt from the blue. League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol has telegraphed back, stating that he is currently distributing the document to the members of the Executive Council and will convene a meeting on January 11. People in Geneva believe that Abyssinia's request may cause more disputes in the Franco-Italian negotiations in Rome, because one of the topics to be negotiated between France and Italy is the interests of France and Italy in Somalia and Abyssinia in Africa. After the Italian government received the Abyssinian government's document in Geneva, it immediately stated that the Italian army had not engaged in any aggression or bombing and that the Italian army had been stationed in Afdubai for several years. Because Abyssinia had military operations in the disputed area, it had to send planes to reconnaissance. (Reuters Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Italian government has responded to the most recent document from the Abyssinian government to the League of Nations, stating: (1) Italian troops have not advanced into Abyssinian territory; (2) The Afdubai area referred to by the Abyssinian government belongs to the Wal-Wal area, and the Wal-Wal area is indeed guarded by Italian troops; (2) Italian troops did not bomb the Gerlogubi area; (4) Italian aircraft reconnaissance was necessary because a large number of Abyssinian troops were concentrated near Wal-Wal and the Wal-Wal area. It was signed by Italian Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Suvich. After this reply was issued, the Abyssinian government then telegraphed the League of Nations, requesting that the dispute be handled in accordance with Article 11 of the Covenant.

<p>Silver Purchase Law Completely Ineffective</p>
<p>(Washington) It was announced here today that since June of last year, the cash inflow to the United States has reached a huge sum of 400 million US dollars. Therefore, the government's attempt to increase the silver reserves in the national treasury to one-third of the gold reserves in accordance with the regulations of the 1934 silver purchase has become completely ineffective as a result. Although the Ministry of Finance has purchased a large amount of silver in the world silver market, according to the Associated Press statistics, it is still far from the goal of purchasing silver. On May 31 last year, the total value of gold was $7,778,883,214, and the total value of silver was $832,762,767, which was only 10.7% of the gold reserves. By December 29, the number of gold reserves had increased to $8,232,732,078, while the number of silver reserves was still only $1,027,464,169, which was only 13.2% of the gold reserves. Therefore, after half a year of government silver purchases, the only result was to increase the silver reserve ratio by 2.5%. If the original goal is to be achieved, experts calculate that another 133 million ounces of silver must be purchased. At the same time, the Associated Press also learned that only 200 million yuan of the United States' 200 billion yuan balance fund has been used, and its use is not limited to one item.</p>

<p>Policy of Maintaining the Gold Standard Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>(Paris) It was announced here today that Tannery has replaced Moret as Governor of the Bank of France. The reason for the change has not been explained. However, Tannery is a proponent of the public sale of treasury bonds, which is the same opinion as French Prime Minister Flandin and contrary to Moret's opinion. Finance Minister Germain, Benard, and Tannery's appointment as Governor of the Bank of France said that the current policies of the Ministry of Finance will not change. The plan of former President Poincaré to revive national finances will continue to be carried out, and Moret's advocacy of maintaining the franc will also be maintained. He and the new governor are determined to support the gold standard. It was previously rumored in French financial circles that the government planned to issue treasury bonds totaling 200 billion francs for private purchase, but they could be discounted and purchased by the Bank of France. Moret did not agree with this policy. Now that Tannery has been appointed as governor, it proves that the previous saying had a basis. It is said that this policy of the government is the result of a large increase in the issuance of banknotes, but the subsequent reduction in interest rates should offset the impact of rising prices. Because it is difficult to raise long-term loans, the government will have no way to cope with the debts of 1935 unless it adopts this new policy. Some say that the French government wants to imitate the British cheap currency policy so that it can drop back to long-term loans in the future. The announcement of Tannery's appointment as Governor of the Bank of France and the news that France and Italy have reached an agreement have caused a boom in the exchange. French public bonds rose 135 centimes, and other bonds also rose one after another. (Reuters Telegram, 2nd)</p>

<p>Free State Livestock Traded for British Coal</p>
<p>(London) The Irish Free State and the British government have signed a gentleman's agreement, which stipulates that the Irish Free State will purchase a certain number of tons of British coal, and the United Kingdom will allow the import of livestock of equal value from Ireland. Many view this agreement as an important step towards restoring normal relations between Britain and Ireland, and some hope that this development may lead to progress in the existing political problems between Britain and Ireland. As a result of this agreement, British coal imports to the Irish Free State will increase by more than one million tons, and Irish livestock imports to the United Kingdom will increase by 150,000 heads. (Reuters Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) According to Dominion Minister Thomas, it is expected that the Irish Free State will purchase all of its coal from Britain in the future. British coal exports to the Irish Free State can be expected to increase by approximately 1.25 million tons annually, and British coal mines will increase recruitment by 5,000 workers as a result. According to Irish Free State leader de Valera today, this Anglo-Irish agreement is one of the Free State government's constant expressions of willingness to make understanding. If there are opportunities to continue to make the same understanding as today in the future, it is expected that both sides will accept them in the same spirit. (Reuters Telegram, 3rd)</p>

<p>Lin Bai Couple Appear in Court to Testify</p>
<p>Flemington – Hauptmann, the German carpenter and principal offender in the Lin Bai Zi kidnapping case, was brought to trial at the court here today. The young lawyer Wilentz first stated the charges, saying, "We will prove that the perpetrator of this crime sits before the court today." As he spoke, he pointed to the defendant. He then described in detail the circumstances of the crime, stating that the defendant used a ladder to sneak into Lin Bai's son's bedroom, carried him out of bed, and inadvertently broke the ladder while descending, causing the child to fall to his death. The defendant then took the child's pajamas to negotiate the ransom. Wilentz then described the situation of identifying the body at the graveyard. The jurors looked sorrowful upon hearing this. After Wilentz finished his speech, the defendant's lawyer Reilly requested that the trial be invalidated because Wilentz was trying to move the jurors with tragic words, which was detrimental to the defendant. However, this motion was rejected by the judge. Mrs. Lin Bai testified in court, speaking in a low voice with tears in her eyes, describing in detail the window through which her son was stolen, and accurately identifying her son's toys, film and sleeveless vest, saying that she had personally made them. Mrs. Lin stood in the witness stand for forty-five minutes. The defendant Hauptmann initially sat blankly, staring at the people in front of him, but when Mrs. Lin Bai gave her testimony, he showed signs of unease. Colonel Lin Bai then testified that on the night his son was stolen, he opened the door and heard the sound of a ladder falling. (Reuters dispatch from the 3rd)</p>
<p>Flemington – Reilly, the lawyer defending Hauptmann, announced today that he intends to broadcast his defense, stating that he will prove that this case was a conspiracy within the Lin Bai's house, but none of the Lin Bai family was involved. There were five accomplices in total, whose names will be announced in court. The child was apparently carried directly out of the upstairs, rather than stolen from the nurse's window using a ladder. It is reported that Reilly has been practicing law for 25 years and has handled over a thousand murder cases. (Reuters dispatch from the 4th)</p>

<p>The time for the Saar vote is near (French Communications)</p>
<p>The focus of the Franco-German dispute</p>
<p>The coal and iron relationship is most important</p>
<h3 id="e90">If France and Italy unite, Germany will become even more isolated <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The Saar region, with an area of only 190,000 square kilometers and a population of only 780,000, occupies such an important position between France and Germany that it could even cause changes throughout Europe. In the past, when the Paris Peace Conference was held, this land caused opposition from British Prime Minister Lloyd George and American President Wilson. As a result, it was agreed that a general vote of the local people would be held on January 13, 1935, to determine whether the Saar should belong to Germany or France.</p>
<p>In terms of local ethnic relations, more than 90 percent of the people are of German descent. They all speak German and have the customs of Germany. The French account for only 3 to 5 percent. Therefore, in the fifteen years since the end of the war until recently, France has spent tens of millions of francs each year to establish French elementary schools and technical schools there, but the results have not been very good, and the number of students has decreased year by year. Other efforts to buy people's hearts, such as news media and cultural lectures, have not been able to achieve the expected results.</p>
<p>Originally, Germany ruled the Saar before the Treaty of Versailles, for more than a century from 1816 to 1918, while France held the area for only 22 years from 1792 to 1815. Therefore, the German people account for the vast majority of the local population. It is naturally impossible to change the people's thinking in a short period of one or two decades, when European nationalism is still prevalent. If we speculate according to common sense, the results of the vote may not be favorable to France. If the current Germany does not oppress Jews or Catholics, then the Saar people will certainly vote to return to Germany. At present, the people living in the Saar are concerned about their own safety and feel the future political oppression, so they cannot help but hesitate about the issue of returning to Germany.</p>
<p>In fact, France prepared for this move when it signed the Treaty of Versailles, separating the ground security and the underground minerals. The treaty stipulates that if the Saar region votes to return to Germany, then Germany must prepare cash to buy the minerals, otherwise the Saar's coal and iron mines will still belong to France.</p>
<p>In 1933, the Saar's monthly average production was 130,000 tons of pig iron, 140,000 tons of steel, and 880,000 tons of coal. Its pig iron production is approximately 29 percent of the total production of Germany and 24 percent of the total production of France. Steel production is approximately 22 percent of the total production of Germany and 24 percent of France. This shows its important position. Germany naturally wants to use this to restore its national power, and France also wants to use it to stabilize its hegemony. In particular, after Germany advocated the abolition of the Treaty of Versailles, Britain also hinted at sympathy, and Italy clearly stated that the treaty should be revised immediately. Therefore, the former French Foreign Minister Barthou traveled extensively, first communicating fully with the small countries surrounding Germany's borders, such as the Danube River basin countries, and unanimously supporting the Treaty of Versailles and the League of Nations. Fearing that their strength was weak and insufficient to subdue Germany, he also brought the Soviet Union into the League of Nations, vaguely forming an alliance. As a result, the foundation of the League of Nations in Europe was further consolidated, and Britain naturally had to express its alignment with the League of Nations. The only remaining problem was the relationship with Italy. If Barthou had not been assassinated in Marseille, he would have visited the Blackshirt Prime Minister to discuss this issue after sending back the King of Yugoslavia. Now Laval has succeeded him and is still paying close attention to the work of uniting with Italy.</p>
<p>Since the European continental countries are all focused on maintaining the status quo, Germany is inevitably diplomatically isolated. Even if Germany wins the vote on January 13, it will only gain political control on the ground. To take control of the minerals, it must still use cash to buy them. Otherwise, it will only be possible to forcibly break the Treaty of Versailles. However, in diplomacy, except for Poland's slightly better feelings towards Germany, the remaining countries cannot be considered allies. Moreover, France still has the right to send troops into the Saar according to the treaty, and is already preparing. Germany's strength, whether in military or economic terms, is insufficient to cope with war, and it cannot use the League of Nations. The best outcome is probably still for the League of Nations to continue to manage it. (December 1st, Paris)</p>
<h3 id="e91">Detailed Account of Zhang Weicun's Death in Shandong <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Shot dead on the spot at the Jinde Association</p>
<p>His follower Yang Jinjian was also injured in the neck at the same time</p>
<p>The murderer is on the run, only dozens of suspects have been apprehended</p>
<p>Han reports to the Central Government and orders the military and police to arrest the murderer</p>
<p>Jinan correspondence, Zhang Weicun, alternate member of the Central Executive Committee, concurrently standing committee member of the Shandong Provincial Party Department and member of the Provincial Government, was suddenly attacked tonight (2nd) at the Jinde Association after guiding the New Life Movement lantern parade. He was shot five times and died on the spot. His follower Yang Jinjian was also injured in the neck and was admitted to the hospital for treatment. All three murderers escaped without a trace. After the incident, dozens of suspects were apprehended while searching the visitors and are currently being interrogated. It is generally speculated that Zhang's tragic death was mostly due to an assassination by reactionary elements. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Today (2nd) was the second day of the Shandong New Life Movement lantern parade. It was stipulated in advance that Zhang Weicun of the Provincial Party Committee was responsible for guiding it. The assembly point was in the Huangting Stadium in the city, and the time was 6:00 PM. Zhang had dinner at his private residence on Xiemalu at 4:00 PM and went to the Provincial Party Department in the city at 5:00 PM to inspect and urge the Party Department personnel to go to the assembly quickly. At 6:00 PM, he went to the Huangting Stadium to speak to the people participating in the lantern parade, and said that he would go to the Jinde Association and agreed to meet everyone at the Jinde Association. Then he went to the Jinde Association in the commercial port with Provincial Government Advisor Ma Qianli and Councilor Zhao Yunxie in a car. After entering the association, Ma and Zhao went to the Jingju Theater to watch a play. Zhang wanted to find a place for the people of the lantern parade, so he took his follower Yang Jinjian and walked along the front of the association's office from north to south. The place was relatively remote, so there were very few visitors. Unexpectedly, when they walked to the west of the Peacock Pavilion behind the banquet hall, at about 6:50 PM, there were three people ambushing there. One tall person was wearing a gray cotton robe, and the other two were shorter than the person in gray. They took out their guns and first shot at Zhang's follower Yang Jinjian. Yang was injured and fell to the ground. The murderers continued to fire many shots at Zhang, who was shot five times and died on the spot. Zhang and Yang both carried guns, but because the incident happened suddenly, they did not have time to open fire. After committing the crime, the murderers dispersed and fled. When the military and police in the association heard the sound and rushed to the scene, the murderers had already disappeared. They saw Zhang lying in a pool of blood with his head facing south and his feet facing north. His follower Yang Jinjian was also next to him. Because Yang was shot in the neck and did not injure the esophagus, his life was not in danger. He was immediately carried to Jinan Hospital for treatment, while Zhang's flesh</p>
<h2>Page 15</h2>
<p>was blurred, his brain was outside, blood was flowing all over the ground, and he died without hope of recovery.</p>
<p>After the incident, Li Shuchun, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Wang Shiqi, Director of the Public Security Bureau, Shi Jingzhou, Director of the Military Law Department, and Wu Huawen, Commander of the Garrison, all rushed to the scene after hearing the news. They immediately ordered the military and police to impose a temporary curfew, banning pedestrians from passing by the Jinde Association and searching the association separately. Three bullet casings were found at the scene of the incident, which could be identified as having been used by a Browning pistol, but no murder weapon was found. At that time, the Jingju Garden and Dagu Book Field in the Jinde Association were all performing, so they temporarily sent people to guard the door, prohibiting people from leaving. On the one hand, they checked the visitors at the gate, first letting the women and children in the garden out, and then letting the visitors in each garden out in batches, all of whom were searched by the military and police one by one. Those whose appearance was suspicious, except for legitimate merchants who were allowed to leave, were closed in a separate room for questioning. By midnight, all the visitors had left, and Li Shuchun and others questioned the dozens of suspects separately and then handed them over to the enforcement team and the Public Security Bureau for detention.</p>
<p>When Zhang Weicun was shot, his wife, Ms. Liu Jinwen, was watching a play in the Jingju Theater, and she did not expect that her husband would suddenly suffer a tragic death. After returning home, she heard the news and immediately rushed back to the Jinde Association. Seeing her husband die tragically, she cried bitterly. Before long, Zhang Shengxi, supervisor of the Provincial Party Department (Zhang Weicun's uncle), Li Ziqian, executive member, and others also rushed to the scene. They immediately found someone to carry Zhang's body back to the Zhang residence at No. 6 Xiaowei Road, Jingliu Road, preparing to put it in a coffin tomorrow (3rd). At 10:00 PM that night, the Zhang residence first invited a doctor to the residence to wash the wounds on Zhang's body. Before long, Zhou Wenbin, the chief prosecutor of the local court, personally went to the Zhang residence to examine the body. It was counted that Zhang had suffered five injuries. One bullet entered the right cheek and exited the left cheek. One bullet entered the temple and exited the left temple. Two other bullets passed through the sides of the lower abdomen and penetrated out of the back. One bullet passed through the left arm, only injuring the outer skin.</p>
<p>Zhang Weicun was from Shandong. In addition to handling Party affairs, he was also engaged in social undertakings such as schools, hospitals, and charities. Therefore, the members of the Provincial Party Department and people from all walks of life went to offer condolences that night. After hearing about Wei Cun's death, Han Fuju, Chairman of the Provincial Government, was very saddened. In addition to sending a telegram to the Central Party Department and Chairman Jiang and President Wang to report and request a posthumous award for Zhang, he also ordered the military and police to strictly arrest the murderer and bring them to justice. Zhang was thirty-eight years old this year. He still has a grandfather named Wenbin, who is eighty-five years old this year. Zhang's father, Jingting, is fifty-nine years old this year, and his mother, Leng, is sixty-two years old. He has one younger brother, named Fuju, who is fourteen years old, and a son named Minsheng, who is also fourteen years old, studying at Donglu Middle School in this city. Zhang's wife, Ms. Liu Jinwen, is thirty-five years old this year. (Night of the 2nd)</p>
<p>Another report, since the assassination of Liu Lianyi, a member of the Provincial Party Department, in Shandong Province in the nineteenth year, there have been very few similar incidents involving Party and government workers. Unexpectedly, at 7:00 PM last night (2nd), Zhang Weicun, an alternate member of the Central Executive Committee, standing committee member of the Shandong Provincial Party Department, and member of the Provincial Government, was suddenly assassinated and died. Today (3rd), the military and police agencies are cooperating to arrest the murderer and have offered a reward of 50,000 yuan for the arrest of the murderer. There is still no news. No murder weapon was found in the Jinde Association, the scene of the incident. It is generally suspected that the murderer is a well-organized group. The body has been placed in a coffin tonight (3rd) and the aftermath is being handled. Key figures from the Party, government, and military are all going to offer condolences. The following is a further record of the news from all sides:</p>
<p>Relatives Expressed: Chairman Han paid close attention to the assassins' guns and ordered a thorough search to capture them for research, but so far, nothing has been found. According to Zhang Zhuxi, Zhang's uncle and supervisor of the Provincial Party Department, there are no clues in this case at present. It is impossible to make a hasty judgment on what kind of person committed the crime, but judging from the circumstances at the time of the incident, it does not seem to be a private feud, because a private feud would only involve one person who held a grudge. Now there are at least three murderers, who were calm and composed, which is obviously an organized action. Four of the shots fired hit the head, and their accurate, skilled technique also shows that they are accustomed to this, which cannot be compared to those who vent their anger rashly. However, the three murderers had at least three guns. After the incident, it is estimated that they must have abandoned their guns and tried to escape. On the one hand, the gate was guarded and inspected, but as a result, from last night until now, the ditches, toilets, and garbage piles in the garden have been searched almost everywhere, but no trace has been found. It is really incomprehensible where the assassins came from.</p>
<p>Reward for Arresting the Murderer: After this incident occurred, Han Fuju, Chairman of the Provincial Government, sent a telegram to the Central Party Department, the Executive Yuan, and other places to report, and at the same time strictly arrested the murderer. Jinan is the location of the provincial capital, with tight defenses, and the Jinde Association is even more densely populated by military and police. The murderer openly killed the Party and government officials, which is extremely bold. He ordered the arrest to be brought to justice, and issued a notice offering a reward for the arrest of the murderer. The text reads: (Zhang Weicun, a member of the Shandong Provincial Party Department, was attacked by bandits at the Jinde Association. Those who can report inside information to solve the case will be given a reward of 20,000 yuan. Those who can fully disclose the case and solve it will be given a reward of 50,000 yuan. The funds are deposited and will not be broken. Shandong Provincial Government, January 3rd,)</p>
<p>Handling the Aftermath: After Zhang Weicun's death, the aftermath is being handled. This morning (3rd), Chairman Han convened a meeting of the directors, members, Chief of Staff Liu Shuxiang, Director of the Military Law Department Shi Jingzhou, Jinan Garrison Commander Wu Huawen, and Director of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau Wang Shiqi in the Provincial Government to discuss the aftermath and offer a reward for the arrest of the murderer. At 8:00 AM, Wei Cun's wife, Liu Jinwen, in plain clothes, went to the Provincial Government to see Han, prostrated herself on the ground and cried for the arrest of the murderer. Han told her about the reward and the strict orders for the arrest, and told her that the public would take full responsibility for the affairs after the death of Committee Member Zhang, and asked her to rest assured. Liu thanked him with tears and left. The funeral preparation office has been established, with three directors: Li Tianni, Councilor of the Provincial Government, Cao Junfeng, Deputy Director of the Reception Office, and Li Wenzhai, Standing Committee Member of the Provincial Party Department. Zhang's remains have been placed in a coffin today (3rd). The coffin is made of cypress wood and is worth more than 400 yuan. Zhang's residence has been set up with sheds to prepare for the funeral at a fixed time. Han Fuju (Han also serves as the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Department) notified the Provincial Party Department today that after the death of Committee Member Zhang, the staff of the Standing Committee will continue to work as usual and cannot be changed. No meetings may be held without his consent. The Provincial Party Department has decided to close the office for one day tomorrow (4th), and all staff will go to pay their respects.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Party and Government Offices Operated as Usual Yesterday <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The city's party, government, and military agencies were ordered to cease operations for three days from New Year's Day to the 3rd, which has now ended. Starting yesterday, the city party headquarters, municipal government, and its affiliated bureaus resumed normal operations. Mayor Wu arrived at the city hall at 6:00 AM to review official documents.</p>
<p>Silver and Money Industries Held a Joint Meeting Yesterday After Reopening</p>
<p>Summary Accounting and Silver Coin Transportation Requests for Facilitation</p>
<p>Further Consultation Today Before Visiting Finance Minister Kong for Request</p>
<p>After the New Year holiday, money exchanges and banks reopened on the previous two days. Yesterday at 4:00 PM, a joint meeting of the executive committees of both associations was held to discuss the issue of facilitating the transportation of silver coins during summary accounting. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Reopening Dates</p>
<p>Money exchanges, members of the Money Exchange Association, resumed operations on the day before yesterday, following established regulations for a two-day New Year holiday. A general meeting resolved that February 3rd would be the summary accounting date for the 23rd year of the Republic of China. Banks, members of the Banking Association, resumed operations yesterday morning, following association regulations for a three-day New Year holiday, and resumed normal business. Simultaneously, the Banking Joint Preparatory Committee and the Clearing House also resumed normal operations yesterday.</p>
<p>Joint Meeting</p>
<p>Yesterday at 4:00 PM, the Banking and Money Exchange Associations held a joint executive committee meeting at the Banking Association on Hong Kong Road. Present were all committee members, including Chen Guangfu and Xu Qizhi from the banks, Qin Runqing and Yu Zuoting from the money exchanges, as well as Qin Xiqing and Lin Kanghou, the secretaries-general of both associations. The chairman first reported that the money exchange summary accounting was set for February 3rd. At that time, various businesses would need a significant amount of silver coins for settlement. Since the Ministry of Finance stipulated that a permit was required to transport silver, transportation would be quite inconvenient. It was decided on the spot to request the Ministry of Finance to facilitate the procedures for transporting silver coins during summary accounting. The meeting adjourned around 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Visiting Finance Minister Kong</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the Banking and Money Exchange industries yesterday that the two industry associations would hold another consultation today. Then, each association would appoint committee members to jointly visit Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi and state that various businesses would need a significant amount of cash for settlement during the summary accounting of the 23rd year of the Republic of China. They would request facilitation of procedures for transporting silver coins and offer suggestions for adoption and implementation.</p>
<p>Mei Lehe Visited Kong</p>
<p>Kong Set to Go to Nanjing on the 7th</p>
<p>Mei Lehe, the Director-General of Customs Revenue of the Ministry of Finance, returned to Shanghai a few days ago and visited old friends in Shanghai. He went to the office yesterday to cancel his leave. It was also learned that Mei visited Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi at his residence on West Aihs Road yesterday morning. After Mei left, Kong went to the Central Bank to work and set the date to go to Nanjing on the 7th (next Monday).</p>
<p>Chen Shaokuan Will Cancel His Leave</p>
<p>Expected to Go to Nanjing Next Week to Take Up His Duties</p>
<p>Navy Minister Chen Shaokuan accompanied Chairman Chiang from Ningbo to Hangzhou, and then returned to Shanghai by car from Hangzhou on the evening of the 2nd. He is still staying at the Astor House Hotel. According to naval circles, Chen's leave is about to expire, and he is expected to go to Nanjing in the middle of next week to cancel his leave and take up his duties.</p>
<p>Yang Yongtai Talks About Chairman Chiang's Recent Life</p>
<p>False Teeth Have Been Fitted and Appetite Has Increased Daily</p>
<p>Taking Advantage of the Relatively Free Military Affairs to Return to His Hometown for a Short Stay</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Yang Yongtai, the Secretary-General of the Nanchang Headquarters, went to Hangzhou on December 30th of last year to visit Chairman Chiang. He returned to Shanghai the next day. The reporter visited Yang yesterday and asked about Chairman Chiang's recent life. Yang said that the Chairman's dental problems had not been fundamentally treated due to the busy military affairs of suppressing bandits in recent years. This time, he returned to Nanjing and consulted a specialist doctor who extracted all his diseased teeth. Recently, he has had false teeth fitted, so his appetite has increased daily, and his complexion is radiant. The outside world's claim that his gums were sore and festering after the extraction is not true. He participated in the inauguration ceremony of Chairman Huang of the Zhejiang Provincial Government and various committee members in Hangzhou a few days ago. Because the military affairs of suppressing bandits in Jiangxi and Fujian have come to an end, and preparations and deployments are also underway in Sichuan, he took advantage of this time when military affairs were relatively free to return to his hometown for a short stay to recuperate.</p>
<p>The Future of China National Aviation Corporation Is Very Promising</p>
<p>Achievements of the Past Year 23</p>
<p>And Progress Plans for This Year</p>
<p>China National Aviation Corporation's gradual progress in the past year 23 has been detailed in this newspaper. A comparison of the company's operating income from its establishment in 1929 to the end of 1934 shows that passenger traffic has increased by 50%, and mail transport has increased to 20%. Comparing the income situation over the years, its rapid progress has created a momentum of rapid advancement in China's new aviation industry, and the future is very promising. The reporter inquired with the company yesterday, and details are as follows:</p>
<p>Adding New Aircraft</p>
<p>Starting January 8, 1935, the company will change the Shanghai-Guangdong flights to fly from Shanghai to Guangdong every Tuesday and Friday and return from Guangdong to Shanghai every Thursday and Sunday. The existing Douglas aircraft may not be sufficient, so the company has purchased the largest new aircraft from the United Aircrafts Corporation in the United States. This aircraft can accommodate sixteen people and has an average speed of 290 kilometers per hour. If there is a need to increase flights on this route this year, it will be added to facilitate passenger traffic in South China. In addition to the Stinson aircraft currently used on the Shanghai-Beijing route, the company plans to add a Douglas transport aircraft with two-way wireless communication and the safest equipment. This aircraft flies at 290 kilometers per hour, can accommodate fourteen passengers, and is safe and perfectly equipped. The current flight time on the Shanghai-Beijing route is eight hours, but with this aircraft, it can be reached in about four and a half hours. The company is also preparing the Chongqing-Kunming route and has decided to use Ford aircraft specifically for this route. These aircraft have been ordered and will soon be transported to Shanghai. The aircraft has three engines and is perfectly equipped, and flying is very safe. The company has decided to purchase four Fairchild aircraft for the existing Loening aircraft used on the Hankou-Chongqing route. This type of aircraft is very suitable for flying in the Yangtze River basin. The aircraft is equipped with a two-way wireless communication device and two engines. The aircraft has a speed of approximately 250 kilometers per hour and can accommodate six passengers, making flying very safe.</p>
<p>Trial Flights on New Routes</p>
<p>The company is currently planning the Chongqing-Kunming route, which will allow direct access from Shanghai to Kunming, Yunnan, opening up the most convenient transportation in the southwest. However, the voyage is long, with many mountains and harsh climates. The company is making extremely cautious preparations. The company has first installed many wireless radio stations and has ordered the latest Ford aircraft from the United Aircrafts Corporation in the United States, specifically for this route.</p>
<p>Land Route Exploration</p>
<p>The company feels that the route from Batang to Lhasa is more difficult to plan than the Chongqing-Kunming route. Installing radio stations and expanding airports cannot be predetermined by sending aircraft for trial flights first. Therefore, it has been decided to send personnel by land to start on-site investigations in these two places. After the investigation is accurate, the route and landing locations can be determined. This procedure is currently being planned and will be implemented this year.</p>
<p>Expanding the Airport</p>
<p>The company believes that the original Longhua Airport is narrow, making it extremely inconvenient for larger aircraft to land and take off. Since the decision was made last year to expand the airport, the Ministry of Transportation has sent personnel to assist in renting and purchasing private land to expand the base. Mayor Wu of Shanghai has also provided strong assistance. The issue of expanding the area has been completed. In the future, the difficult situation of larger aircraft landing and taking off in Longhua can be avoided. The company's General Manager, Dai Enji, expressed gratitude for Mayor Wu's assistance to reporters. The company's operating income from 1929 to the end of December 1934 is listed below:</p>

<p>China Pilot Association Preparatory Committee Strives to Revise New Regulations</p>
<p>The Right to Pilotage Is the Most Important Measure for National Defense. Last September, China promulgated Pilotage Regulations to abolish the old regulations of the seventh year of Tongzhi. However, foreign customs officials were the first to oppose it and demand revision. The government has agreed to hand over the recovery of pilotage affairs to the Director-General of Customs. It has now been agreed to prepare a price of 1 million customs taels (equivalent to more than 1.9 million silver dollars) to purchase all the assets and shares of foreign Shanghai pilotage shipping companies and the Shanghai Pilotage Association and revise them. The new regulations will also be announced soon. The content still allows foreigners to serve, and the right to pilotage management is still exclusively in the hands of the customs. The Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Pilot Association in Shanghai believes that this kind of recovery is no different from the previous foreign occupation. The crisis of China's recovery of pilotage has reached the final stage. The situation is urgent. Therefore, a telegram was sent to the National Government to strive for it, which roughly stated (Secretly investigating that the foreign advisers of the customs opposed the recovery of pilotage sovereignty and demanded the revision of the pilotage regulations. The association had already sent a micro-telegram on the 5th of this month to Chen, requesting the chairman to not fall into the trap of traitors in order to protect national rights. Please invite your observation. According to foreign news, the foreign advisers' request has been determined by the Executive Yuan to have four principles, which are handed over to the Ministry of Finance to follow and revise: (1) Abolish the Pilotage Management Committee and change it to customs management, (2) Preserve the positions of old pilots and the assets of the pilotage shipping company, (3) Adopt a compulsory pilotage system, and the pilotage license will be issued by the Ministry of Finance, (3) Purchase the foreign pilotage industry and handle it by the Director-General of Customs. This kind of new regulations has already been drafted and is seeking the opinions of the Director-General of Customs. Once it is approved, it can be published and named Provisional Regulations, etc. It is hereby pointed out that the foreign advisers have long had various conspiracies to destroy the recovery of pilotage. Referring to the conversation between British Minister Cade Gan and our foreign affairs department on March 19 this year, his hopes and the letter from the Shanghai Pilot Association to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, requesting three points, and the Pilotage Management Committee, (omitted) and the gradual reorganization of the pilotage plan by Claire Keick, the private property secretary of the Director-General of Customs, the active figures who are obstructing it have become clear. The regulations that were promulgated in September last year and have not yet been implemented, what is so inconvenient that they have to be changed so quickly? The government's recovery of pilotage was originally based on national defense and military power as a prerequisite, but now the focus of the four principles is not on this. In essence, we already have a feeling of disappointment. Or if we carefully analyze it, there are many loopholes and suspicious points. If we are not careful, we will lose national rights in the future, and it will definitely be worse than the old regulations of the seventh year of Tongzhi. Because since the foreign advisers have served as the Director-General of Customs in our country, the accumulated habits have continued, and the tail is too big to be cut off. The government has no power to command foreign officials, and it has become openly daring to threaten to revise the regulations. This has been going on for a long time. Today, the foreign advisers' request has been complacent, and whether our national rights have been lost, the association's foolishness, I think there is still room for discussion. It is heard that the revised new regulations, regarding the nationality of the pilot, in addition to the existing foreign pilots, will still be preserved. In the future, although the replacement will be limited to Chinese, it is still allowed to be supplemented by foreigners when necessary. What is the difference between changing the soup and not changing the medicine, and the foreign customs officials can use this point at will to deny the qualifications of Chinese to supplement pilotage, and there is a possibility of creating a necessary situation at any time, and continue to use their usual tricks to exclude Chinese and borrow talents from other countries. If you say that you will recover pilotage with this, it will never be realized one day. This is the first thing to consider. Examination is one of the five powers. The pilotage examination should be executed by the Examination Yuan. There is no reason to hand it over to foreigners. Looking at the old regulations of the seventh year of Tongzhi, the election examination was controlled by foreigners. After one year, all Chinese were eliminated, which can be used as a warning. This is the second thing to consider. If the right to manage is controlled by the foreign advisers, even if we can test in the future, the right to appoint and employ is still in the hands of foreigners. Is it in a situation of testing and not using, and existing in name only? This is the third thing to consider. The new regulations of the Shanghai Pilot Association of Foreigners, since it is allowed to exist, then the Chinese pilot in the future will inevitably join the Foreign Association, which is still dominated by foreigners and the Chinese are vassals. There are many obstacles in it. Otherwise, pilotage is a public business and should be organized into a public association. The Chinese can form their own association here, so that the foreigners can be merged into our side. This is the proper way. Does the new regulations take this into account? This is the fourth thing to consider. As for compulsory pilotage, all countries have this system for dangerous harbors and waterways, but this is to preserve the secrets of a country's waterways, entrust the ears and eyes to the people, and obtain national defense guarantees. The law is perfect. Foreign pilotage in our country has not been abolished, so there is no fundamental talk of compulsory pilotage. Now they want to imitate Dong Shi forcibly and entrust the ears and eyes to foreigners. Isn't it a great joke in the world? This is the fifth thing to consider. Since the national crisis, four provinces have been lost, and the shipping industry has been directly affected and has been on the verge of bankruptcy in recent years. Rescuing shipping merchants is one of the important proposals of this year's transportation conference. Why is the relief not being carried out, but instead following the will of the foreign customs officials and implementing compulsory pilotage, which increases the burden on the people? It has not been done through legislative procedures, nor has it sought the consent of the shipping merchants. What is the balance between reason and law? This is the sixth thing to consider. Pilotage is a specialized skill, the same as lawyers and accountants, and is a kind of free business. It is not a government civil servant, and the government cannot use this to make profits, and use the pilot as a tool to open up bad precedents and hinder the people's livelihood. The government has never been able to freely use the customs surplus tons of banknotes handled by the customs, as well as various fines. If compulsory pilotage is implemented, the future pilotage surplus will naturally be the same as the customs surplus and will be arbitrarily distributed by the customs. Isn't this sucking the people's blood to satisfy the foreigners' desires? This is the seventh thing to consider. Furthermore, the proposal for compulsory pilotage was initiated by the customs in the eleventh year of the Republic of China. Their intention was to increase the burden on Chinese shipping merchants and increase the income of foreign pilotage associations. A small part of this would be allocated to hire a few Chinese pilots to ease the Chinese atmosphere. However, the Chinese salary was only set at one-fourth of that of foreigners, and the remaining subsidies were used by foreigners to reduce the pilotage fees for foreign ships. The trick can be said to be impeccable. This is the eighth thing to consider. The old regulations of the seventh year of Tongzhi were submitted by Hede and approved by the Prime Minister's Office for implementation. From top to bottom, it still does not lose its system and majesty. Our revolutionary government originally had the right to recover. Why do we have to bend over and ask for advice on the customs' request to revise the regulations, and gradually cause the emperor to step down? Even if the government intends to compromise, what about the national system? Moreover, the customs has always advocated that the recovery of pilotage must be approved by the diplomatic corps. Now that the customs' proposal is being listened to, it is a tacit agreement, and the situation is as bad as making a cocoon and binding oneself. The association is not smart, and I am afraid that pilotage will be trapped in a never-ending place from now on. This is the ninth thing to consider. Also, the regulations are said to be provisional, which is intended to reserve room for Liu Dingzheng to correct. However, the old regulations of the seventh year of Tongzhi were also provisional, and the Chinese suffered for 66 years. How should we carefully formulate laws and regulations to ensure everything is safe? It must be known that the customs has foreign debt compensation relations. The Director-General of Customs is the supervisory representative of the creditors in the eyes of foreigners. Pre-event consultation is tantamount to seeking a tiger's skin, causing diplomatic disputes and hindering the power to legislate in the future. On the one hand, it still uses the name of provisional to shirk responsibility. This is the tenth thing to consider. Reading (omitted) Director Wang of the Executive Yuan's report on the National Government Memorial Week said, "During the period of political tutelage, we must train the people to exercise political power. During the period of constitutional government, the people's training has matured and they can exercise political power." One is being trained, and the other is trained to maturity. The need for the expression of the people's power and intention is the same. The truth is clear and in line with the meaning of the people as the foundation of the country. The association takes the position of the people. Regardless of whether the foreign news is true or false, the above ten points are of great importance and are purely for the love of the country and for the expression of the people's power and intention. The government can accommodate the demands of the tax affairs department to the outside world, and it should also respect public opinion internally to show fairness. For this reason, I request that your government must first hand over the new regulations revised by the Ministry of Finance this time to the Legislative, Examination, and Judicial Yuan for review in accordance with the established regulations before they are approved and announced, and then implement them. On one hand, transfer the Legislative Yuan to formulate laws and regulations to make them permanent. On the other hand, please send the revised new regulations to the association so that it can jointly discuss and study the pros and cons with the relevant pilotage groups. There will be a thousand thoughts and one gain to offer as a humble contribution for selection. I hope you will consider and approve the request. I am extremely panicked and waiting for orders.</p>
<p>Popular Donation Payment is Enthusiastic</p>
<p>Since the Emergency Relief Popular Donation Association was established in early December last year, the general manager and staff have worked day and night to handle various popular donations. The results have been excellent. They only took two days off for the New Year holiday, and they have been working as usual since the 3rd. It can be seen that the association is enthusiastic about emergency relief. Wealthy people have been enthusiastic about donating and actively making donations, which has been recorded in various newspapers. It was reported yesterday that Mr. Xu Guannan alone donated 1,000 yuan and sent it to the association for counting. Some wealthy people have not yet paid their donations, so the Emergency Relief Popular Donation Association has sent letters to urge them to do so within a few days so that they can be compiled and sent to the disaster area to save the victims. The Workers' Popular Donation was previously designated to be paid to the Shanghai Bank for collection. The amount is very large. It was reported yesterday that the Zhonghua Book Company donated 2,998 yuan, 8 jiao, and 2 fen, the Dafeng Qingji Weaving Factory donated 400 yuan, and the Yuan Da Leather Factory donated 20 yuan and 5 jiao. A few factories have not yet paid, so the Emergency Relief Popular Donation Association has investigated and sent personnel to urge and collect them on the same day.</p>
<p>Compilation and sending to aid in the conclusion.</p>
<p>Schools: It was reported that yesterday Renji Primary School submitted donations and receipt stubs to the Emergency Relief Popular Donation Association with 3 yuan in silver and 16 jiao in small coins, Yinbei Primary School with 3 yuan in silver and 49 jiao in small coins, Shanghai Girls' High School with 43 yuan and 5 jiao in silver, Wuben Girls' High School with 117 yuan in silver and five copper coins, and Peiben Primary School with 6 yuan in silver and 193 jiao in small coins. In order to popularize donations from all walks of life, the Emergency Relief Popular Donation Association entrusted various newspaper offices, banks, money exchanges, companies, shops, hotels, bookstores, restaurants, movie theaters, amusement parks, silk shops, photo studios, and car dealerships to collect donations. The association believes that disaster victims in various places should first compile and send large sums of money to relieve the suffering in the severe winter climate. The association has sent letters to various newspaper offices, banks, etc., requesting that the donations collected on or before the 5th of this month be sent to the association first so that they can be allocated separately.</p>
<p>The First Route Headquarters Will End at the End of the Month</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Chen Diaoyuan, the commander-in-chief of the First Route Army, has now reached the end of his bandit suppression work. Chen himself will also go to Nanjing to take up his duties. He has specifically requested Chairman Chiang to abolish the headquarters of the First Route Army to save national funds. The subordinate troops will be directly under the Central Headquarters. The headquarters will end at the end of this month. Chairman Chiang has replied by telegram approving the request. The telegram roughly stated that the commander-in-chief is loyal and patriotic and deserves commendation. Please approve the request to handle it, etc.</p>

<p>The Private Postal Bureau Is Still Operating</p>
<p>The Public Security Bureau Sent Personnel to Investigate Yesterday</p>
<p>According to the China News Agency, in order to unify the national postal administration, the Ministry of Transportation specifically instructed the Postal Administration last year to order all private postal bureaus across the country to end operations at the end of the year, and to request the local military and police to persuade them to stop operating at that time. However, the national private postal bureau industry has repeatedly petitioned the central government because it affects the lives of more than 100,000 employees, but to no avail. It is now learned that the industry has hired lawyer Zheng Zhenquan to present three reasons based on the law and has filed an administrative appeal with the Ministry of Transportation. However, due to the New Year holiday, the ministry has not yet approved it. Therefore, the industry has decided to continue operating before the Ministry of Transportation has decided on a proper solution. It is heard that the municipal government authorities ordered the private postal bureaus in Beijing and Zhenjiang to close down. Therefore, yesterday, the Municipal Public Security Bureau sent personnel to persuade the private postal bureaus to comply with the order. The industry representatives explained in detail the difficulties in closing down. The personnel agreed to return to the bureau to report the investigation.</p>
<p>Polish School Ship</p>
<p>Has Arrived in Honolulu</p>
<p>Arriving in Yokohama on February 18</p>
<p>The Polish school ship "Great Pomeranian", donated by the people of the Polish Pomeranian Province, is a steel-plated sailing ship equipped with a huge awning. The interior is also equipped with a motor engine, but it is agreed that the voyage must rely entirely on wind power. The motor is not turned on unless it is absolutely necessary. It is about 78.5 meters long, 13.5 meters wide, and has a deadweight of 1,566 tons. The form is extremely beautiful. It set sail from the port of Dai Niya in Poland on September 16 last year and made a grand voyage around the world. The route includes Copenhagen in Denmark, Krus, Santo Domingo, Gulong Islands, Panama Canal, Honolulu, Yokohama, Kobe, Nagasaki in Japan, Shanghai and Hong Kong in China, Singapore and Batavia in the Nanyang Islands, Cape Town in South Africa, St. Helena, Azores Islands, and finally Dover in England before returning to Poland. The estimated journey will be completed around September 1 this year. The ship has 41 staff members, professors, and lecturers, and 66 students from the Maritime School, for a total of 107 people. The captain, named Mosik Weiqi, is very experienced in sailing. All the work on the ship is allocated and operated by these 66 students. At the same time, teachers teach various merchant marine nautical knowledge. After the voyage is completed, the course will also be completed, and they will be assigned to various merchant ships to work. According to the message from the Polish Embassy yesterday, the ship has arrived in Honolulu and is expected to arrive in Yokohama around February 18, and then temporarily park in Nagasaki to repair the ship. It takes about six days to come to Shanghai from Nagasaki, relying entirely on wind power.</p>
<p>Two Police Stations Inspected Road Police on New Year's Day</p>
<p>Five Hundred and Ten Section Chiefs and Police Officers Arrived</p>
<p>In order to observe the performance of officers at each section and the effectiveness of their training, the two road police stations held a general inspection of all road police and police officers trained at the training center at the McGinn Road Station parade ground at 10:00 a.m. on New Year's Day of the 24th year of the Republic of China (excluding the Cao Yong section and the officers on duty at each section). The stations first formulated an outline of the inspection plan and submitted it to the Road Police Administration Bureau and the bureau chief for inspection and training. At the same time, they also invited senior officials from various departments of the bureau to participate. At 10:00 a.m. on the same day, the section chiefs and police officers arrived one after another, totaling 510 people. Deputy Director Wu of the Road Bureau, Director Shen of the Road Police Administration Bureau, representing Tang Lu, Director Xiao of the Transportation Department, Director Mo of the Materials Department, Deputy Director Cao of the General Affairs Department, Deputy Director Shi of the Mechanical Affairs Department, and Chief Huang, who also served as the chief of the Health Section, arrived on time. The inspection began immediately. All the road police were temporarily divided into five companies, with Zheng Youxiang, Sun Lida, Li Cibai, Zheng Yuou, and Gong Guoliang serving as company commanders, and Deputy Director Liang Chengkai as the commander. Director Ma Shaoping first led Deputy Director Wu and Tang's representative to inspect. Then, the drills began. The procedures were (1) inspection ceremony, (2) review, (3) basic exercises of luck, and (4) national martial arts performance. After the drills, Deputy Director Wu delivered a training speech, (1) hoping to continue in the future, (2) hoping to recognize their position and responsibility. Then, Tang's representative of the Road Police Administration Bureau delivered a training speech. Director Ma gave a speech and thanked the officials present. Finally, he personally led all the police and police station staff to salute Director Wu, Tang's representative, and the guests. After the ceremony, they took a photo and dispersed.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Telegraphs Fujian Province to Abolish Harsh Miscellaneous Wood Taxes</p>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the representatives of the fir wood industry in Fujian Province went to Nanjing to petition for the abolition of illegal harsh miscellaneous taxes, which has been reported in previous newspapers. The Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance paid special attention to this. They had already telegraphed the Fujian Provincial Government to investigate and reply. The Fujian Provincial Government stated that the Shuikou Defense Fee, created by Cai Tingkai, which was 45 yuan per company, should be abolished. However, due to the current extreme financial difficulties, it must be implemented slowly. The Zhuzaki Business Tax (actually a transit tax) created by He Gonggan was listed as a legitimate tax and requested for record. The competent authorities of the Ministry of Finance believe that the government's collection of donations and taxes must take into account the cultivation of tax sources. If harsh miscellaneous taxes that hinder production are allowed to exist, the government's temporary tax revenue will increase. However, due to the decline in both agricultural and commercial production and sales, the legitimate revenue will be sharply reduced, which is tantamount to a suicidal policy of draining the pond to get all the fish. They telegraphed the provincial government to quickly abolish the Shuikou Defense Fee and correct the heavy Zhuzaki Business Tax.</p>
<p>Preparation Progress of the Central Machine Manufacturing Plant</p>
<p>The Central Machine Manufacturing Plant of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce held a foundation stone laying ceremony in Shanghai on New Year's Day. The establishment of this plant is a key day for the future development of industry. The following is a record of the plant's preparation progress:</p>
<p>The government's desire to establish this plant dates back several years. The purpose is to enable the country to manufacture its own machines used in various industries, to prevent waste, and to implement the plan to realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings to develop industry and solve people's livelihoods. It is heard that the start-up cost requires more than 3 million yuan. At a time of financial difficulties, it is not easy to raise this large sum of money. However, in order to implement this policy, the ministry has reached an agreement with the Central Gengkuan Committee. After deliberation by the Central Political Conference, it was approved to borrow a part of the funds from the committee, and the rest will be raised by the ministry itself. This is the source of funds. The next step is to survey the plant site. Caoxie Gorge in Nanjing was once identified as the plant base, but it was not suitable, so another plant site had to be selected. Because the plant's funds are borrowed, it must be able to repay the debt after it is opened. The selection of the plant site must take into account the supply of raw materials, the sales market, and water and land transportation. Shanghai is the center of industry and commerce, and rail transportation is extremely convenient. Setting up a plant here is most suitable. In particular, the selection of workers is easier than in other places. Therefore, after careful consideration, the ministry decided to set up a plant in Shanghai. There was land for sale in Beixinjing, facing Zhenbei Road in the front and connecting to the Suzhou River in the back, which is located between the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways. In the future, the plant's internal tracks can be connected to the two railways, and the automobile road can directly reach the city center. Water and land transportation is most suitable. Previously, the plant organized a preparatory office in Nanjing and sent Situ Xi, the deputy director of the office, to various provinces to investigate the machine needs in various places and the location of raw material production. Then, based on the social needs and the principle of competing with different small factories, the types of products were determined. There are many types of machines, and the types of machines needed in our country are also very complex. Therefore, we must distinguish between urgency and priority and define the scope of manufacturing as three major categories: prime movers, machine tools, and hardware parts. The parts, such as pig iron pipes, seamless steel pipes, and pipe parts, cast iron, cast steel, screws, white iron sheets, and black iron sheets, etc., are all in huge demand in society. In the future, when the plant starts operation, it will be very beneficial to recover rights and interests. Last year, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce also sent Lu Weipu, the director of the office, to various countries in Europe and the West to investigate the latest manufacturing methods and then determine the machines to be purchased. It is heard that the purchase of materials is based on the principle of being the most economical and efficient, so as to save start-up costs. It is also prepared to manufacture a variety of machines and machine parts when expanding in the future. It is also heard that the plant's factory building design uses steel materials for the factory part and adopts the latest European and American methods, so that the transportation of raw materials and finished products during manufacturing follows the shortest and most convenient flow line to increase efficiency. The factory building area is mostly factory, and the office is only a small part. Since the plant's site was changed to Shanghai, the preparatory office has also moved from Nanjing to Shanghai for the convenience of office work. It is heard that its recent work has become more tense. The various things it is preparing are to investigate the market needs at any time, the number of machine parts imported each year, the prices, output, and conditions of various raw materials, and plan the plant's future water and electricity supply and equipment, and how to manufacture the products in the factory in the future to obtain excellent results, and how to promote the business to develop well, and how to train workers to make their skills excellent and obtain the highest work efficiency in the shortest time, are all under constant research, so as to be able to obtain the hope of a rapid increase in production after the plant is opened. It is also heard that the Minister of Industry and Commerce, and the Vice Minister, the Director, etc., have high expectations for the plant and supervise it strictly. The method of handling affairs is to make it scientific, the method of business is to make it commercial, and the selection of staff is based on talent, and the training of workers is adapted to the needs, so that the purpose of machine manufacturing can be directly achieved, and the basic industrial plan of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in the near future can be completed indirectly. Therefore, at the foundation stone laying ceremony on New Year's Day, Minister Chen personally laid the foundation stone, and Vice Minister Liu and Vice Minister Gu also came to the site to guide. It was not grand.</p>
<p>Shareholders of Yuehan Railway Sent a Telegram Requesting a Clear Date for Repaying the Railway Bonds</p>
<p>Ma Xuchao and others, shareholders of the Yuehan Railway, sent a telegram to the government yesterday. Nanjing sent to Chairman Lin of the National Government, Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan, Minister Gu of the Ministry of Railways, Guangzhou sent to Director Li of the Guangshao Railway Bureau, Deputy Director Wang, and all members of the Yue Railway Bond Fund Management Committee. I respectfully think that the Yuehan Railway, since the Ministry of Railways sent personnel to reorganize it, has been approved by the National Government and the Executive Yuan to be nationalized. The original Japanese shares have also been given a method of exchanging shares for public bonds. Starting from 1930, it is stipulated that the principal will be repaid by lottery after five years, and one-twentieth will be repaid each year, and a weekly interest of two percent will be given. I see that the government is sympathetic to the difficulties of the merchants and is very grateful. However, since the issuance of public bonds, five years have passed, that is, 1935 should be the first lottery to repay the principal. Now that the deadline is approaching, the Ministry of Railways has not issued a date and method for the lottery, and the merchants are very anxious. I think that the government has always repaid the principal and interest of various public bonds issued in the past on time to uphold its credibility. The commercial public bonds issued by the Ministry of Railways this time to replace the Yue Railway will also be repaid as scheduled. Moreover, the total amount of this public bond is only more than 16 million yuan. According to the regulations, one-twentieth will be repaid each year, which is only more than 800,000 yuan, and the Yue Railway Bond Fund Protection Committee currently has more than 200,000 yuan in cash. The Yue Railway Bureau has more than 600,000 yuan that has not been allocated to the fund, which adds up to more than 800,000 yuan, which is enough for the first principal repayment. It is also enough to prove that the Ministry of Railways can repay as scheduled. However, the merchants still request that the</p>

<p>The Endless Stream of Strange and Bizarre Events: Many Old Maids Get Married (Shao Yongnan) Jointly Requesting Relief from the Authorities Choosing Mates Within a Set Time Limit, Faces Showing Delight The authorities in Guangxi province, recently aiming to vigorously develop culture, initiated a survey of popular sentiment. Consequently, strange and bizarre events emerged one after another. The most amusing was that a survey team went to Shangjin County for investigation, starting from Zhongyou Road. The results showed that the total number of women in the county was 455, and the number of unmarried old maids aged 25 to 50 accounted for as many as 200, nearly reaching 50% of the total. At the same time, similar situations existed in other villages and towns. For a time, the name of "old maids" in the county spread far and wide. These old maids, mostly feeling sexual hunger but unable to resolve it, jointly protested against the old families and jointly requested relief measures from the county government. The county government immediately accepted the request and sought ways to provide relief. All virgins aged 25 to over 40 were required to choose a mate within a set time limit; failure to do so would result in a heavy fine. Upon hearing the county government's relief measures, the old maids all showed delight, busying themselves with purchasing new clothes in preparation for marriage. It is heard that a certain merchant from Longzhou County, near the county, has purchased a large number of copper and iron beds from Shunxing Company, the largest copper bed store (Bed King) in Shanghai, and transported them to Guangxi. It is not known whether these goods are for their use after choosing mates. The situation is thought-provoking and truly amusing.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Detailed Record of the Lake Society's Formal Attire Campaign <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The Lake Society, seeing that the formal attire prescribed by the Ministry of Interior had not been universally adopted and implemented by the public, launched a significant formal attire campaign, advocating the use of domestic silk and other materials as raw materials, which has attracted attention from all sectors of society. After holding a group worship and dinner on New Year's Day, a meeting was convened at 2:00 PM. Over a thousand people attended, and staff from Bingxun Stenography School were sent to record the proceedings. The details of the meeting are recorded below:</p>
<p>Meeting Venue Arrangement At the entrance of the society, a memorial archway made of pine and cypress branches was erected. At the entrance of the second floor, electric lights spelled out the four characters "Formal Attire Campaign," dazzlingly bright. The meeting was held in the Ying Shi Memorial Hall on the second floor. The Party and National flags and the society's flag were inserted on the podium, with a portrait of the late Premier wearing a blue robe and black mandarin jacket hanging in the center to show the purpose to the attendees. The venue was adorned with colorful silks, to promote the significance of silk.</p>
<p>Chairman's Address The chairman of the conference, Shen Tianhua, reported the purpose of the meeting, stating briefly: The difference between civilization and barbarism lies in etiquette, which most easily demonstrates a country's spirit and cultural atmosphere. Since China has been a land of propriety, how can we abandon the word "propriety"? Therefore, in addition to diplomats, military and police officers having separate formal attire regulations, other sectors should also have a uniform formal attire. The Lake Society's launching of the formal attire campaign is, in terms of strength, a mere drop in the ocean, but we believe that if something should be done, we will not refrain from doing it just because our strength is small, simply to make an initial push for the formal attire campaign. As for the formal attire system promulgated by the Ministry of Interior in 1929, it only specifies a blue robe and black mandarin jacket for men, without mentioning the patterns or simplicity of the attire. However, in the opinion of our society, formal attire is meant to demonstrate civilization and should preferably use domestic silk, so as to promote domestic goods. As for women's formal attire, in addition to the blue jacket and black skirt, the currently popular "qipao" (cheongsam) should be corrected to use the character "qi" from "shuo ren qi qi," which also has a meaning for today's formal attire campaign. Currently, the Huzhou Crepe Industry Association and the Wuxing Silk Weaving and Knitting Associations are advertising prizes to solicit formal attire designs, preparing to organize a judging committee to determine standards and submit them to Party and government agencies for approval and implementation. The formal attire worn by this chairman today is a temporary standard. Today's meeting is the beginning of the campaign. I hope that all comrades from all walks of life will work together to achieve the goal of uniform and tidy formal attire. Following this,</p>
<p>Speeches from Various Sectors The Director of the Department of Etiquette and Customs of the Ministry of Interior, Lu Xirong, delivered a speech, stating briefly: Formal attire is closely related to customs and has a great impact on national spirit. The government attaches great importance to this matter. The Lake Society's holding of the formal attire campaign also implies the promotion of domestic silk. Chinese people should wear domestic goods, so that the national economy has hope of recovery. Shanghai is a place of national attention. The formal attire campaign, launched in Shanghai, will surely have a positive impact nationwide. From the habits of 3 million citizens, extended to 400 million compatriots, this is the best approach. I also hope that the formal attire campaign will not only promote national spirit but also promote domestic goods and assist in the development of the national economy. Next, Zhu Xuechun, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, delivered a speech, stating briefly: China has 2,000 years of culture, why is its international status low? The only reason is that progress stalled at a certain point, leading to a state of not knowing what to do. To raise international status, we must first develop inherent cultural morality. Everyone should pay attention to etiquette. To pay attention to etiquette, we must first promote formal attire. Silk is a major Chinese product. The raw materials for formal attire should be domestic silk, because Huzhou is a silk-producing area. Currently, domestic silk is under pressure from foreign artificial silk, becoming more and more serious, leading to the collapse of the silk industry. It is a great mistake for Chinese people not to use domestic goods but to use foreign goods. Next, Qiu Henian, representative of the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, delivered a speech, stating briefly: It is very meaningful to promote formal attire and domestic goods in Shanghai, because every move in Shanghai attracts national attention. As long as the atmosphere in Shanghai changes, the whole country will change. The formal attire campaign should not only promote domestic clothing materials but also all other supplies should use domestic goods. I, as an official in the Trademark Bureau, have felt in the past few years that the output of domestic goods is really too poor. Chinese trademarks are less than one-tenth of foreign trademarks. Now, the variety of domestic goods is increasing daily, enough for the needs of the Chinese people. The previous promotion of domestic goods was merely a response to stimulation and temporary emotional impulse, and it was soon forgotten. Now, domestic goods have all three points of "beauty," "durability," and "cheapness," which are very suitable for the purchasing power of the people. This is the significance of promoting domestic goods in the formal attire campaign. Next, Yan Duhe delivered a speech, stating briefly: Ladies and gentlemen, today is New Year's Day, and everyone has new hopes and new progress. The formal attire campaign, with the meeting held today, especially on New Year's Day, which is full of new progress and new hope, is even more meaningful. The formal attire campaign has two purposes: first, to respect the system, to put it plainly, is to let everyone know etiquette and respect Chinese etiquette; second, to promote formal attire and domestic goods. Let's talk about the first point, why respect etiquette? Of course, formal attire is related to the etiquette of a country. Although it is very simple in history, it is also very clear. In the past, every change of dynasty would first change the "calendar" and then change the clothing colors. Why change the clothing colors? The most important thing is because clothing is very related to the society, the country, and the entire people. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, the "calendar" has been changed and the world's uniform calendar has been adopted, canceling the lunar calendar. When it comes to clothing colors, it has not been changed much. On the one hand, the uniform clothing for diplomats and police has been stipulated; on the other hand, formal attire has been formulated, with black mandarin jackets and blue robes. Although this formal attire has been stipulated, the public has not complied with it. Whether it is weddings, funerals, or dances, the clothes worn are almost the same. This set of clothes is worn at home, and this set is worn to congratulate or mourn. It is really ridiculous. Just like acting, although the role is played in a game, there is a certain costume, and marriage has the color of marriage, and funerals have the appearance of funerals, so that people can know at a glance. Otherwise, wouldn't it be like a clown performing a play, not following certain rules? Our various actions, because we are the parties involved, we don't feel fake ourselves. If we stand as bystanders to see the actions of the Chinese people, when we encounter celebrations or condolences, it is so chaotic, disregarding appearance, and lacking spirit. Even a team of soldiers, if their clothes are messy, we can tell at a glance that they are not a good army. Therefore, the first point of promoting formal attire is to respect etiquette, and the second point is to promote domestic goods. Just now, Mr. Qiu has said that the number of domestic goods has increased day by day. Promoting domestic goods does not necessarily require a formal attire campaign, but the formal attire campaign cannot fail to pay attention to promoting domestic goods. Promoting domestic goods should not only focus on clothing materials, but also on food, we must focus on domestic goods. Using our own domestic goods, silk, is a Chinese thing. China has 400 million people, and counting one-third of the rural farmers, and excluding a part of the poor who don’t wear silk, there are still 100 million to 200 million people who can wear silk. The silk industry is not without a solution. Moreover, the current silk price is extremely cheap, almost some good cloth is more expensive than silk. As long as everyone can use it, there is no worry that silk will not prosper. I hope that the New Year's Day of 1935 is the beginning of this movement, and on the New Year's Day of 1936, we will hold a commemorative meeting for the success of the movement. Next, Mr. Wang Yansong of the Silk Industry Bank said briefly: There have been many actions related to promoting domestic goods in the past, such as the Women's Domestic Goods Year, the Domestic Goods Exhibition, and the Silk Exhibition last year. Now in 1935, we are still promoting domestic goods. Everyone wears formal attire. At the same time, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce also held a Student Domestic Goods Year and a Domestic Goods Exhibition. Many movements in China in the past two years have also achieved much success. On the surface, they have been quite successful. Today's formal attire conference, Mr. Yan Duhe has just said that formal attire is important to individuals, to the nation, and to the country. I have another point, that formal attire is also very important to customs. We wear formal attire, there must be special things, or weddings, or funerals, or banquets, are more important things. Wearing formal attire should wear clothes made of Chinese goods. Today, I met two people with different ones, one is Director Pan, wearing Chinese clothes, which are domestic goods, his robe only costs six yuan, and he wore a suit, which cost one hundred and twenty yuan. Compared, Chinese clothes only cost six yuan, and Western clothes are so much more expensive, so it can be seen that domestic goods are cheaper. Then, from this point of view, imported goods are neither economical nor profitable. It’s better to promote domestic goods. However, the formal attire campaign should lead by example. Yesterday was the New Year's Eve, and there were no dance halls in Hangzhou in Nanshi, so a group of political leaders all ran to Shanghai to enter the dance halls, wearing Western clothes and eating big meals. They refused to earnestly practice it themselves, but called on everyone to use domestic goods. They couldn’t lead by example. If this continues, I’m afraid that domestic goods will be promoted every year, and the import surplus will increase every year. Next, Mr. Wang Xiaolai said briefly: The speaker just now was Mr. Wang Yansong. At this moment, I am speaking, and we are both surnamed Wang, we should do a double act. Everyone should know that the way to do a double act is that one person speaks and one person does, how to say, how to do, if you say and don't do, it's not a double act. We promote formal attire, we must be like a double act, while saying, we must do it, that's right. Today is New Year's Day. When friends see it, they always open their mouths and congratulate you on getting rich. In fact, to get rich, you must first develop your business. Rather than saying congratulations on getting rich, it is better to say congratulations on your business. Otherwise, everyone wants to get rich, there are banks on the market, but no factories, what is it like? No wonder the banks are going bankrupt. Let's talk about formal attire. China is a country of culture and objects. Etiquette, music, archery, writing, and mathematics are literature. Etiquette is the most important. The important place to show etiquette is clothing. Now we promote formal attire, but the felt hats worn on the head and the leather shoes worn on the feet are all foreign goods. Isn't it headless and tailless? Therefore, we promote formal attire and domestic goods, we must thoroughly understand it, and don't be headless and tailless. Next, Mr. Luo Qinghua of the Silk Industry Association made an adjustment, stating briefly: Promoting formal attire is not only the matter of the Lake Society, nor is it only the matter of the silk industry, but the matter of the whole nation. China has had formal attire for a long time. Since the promulgation of the formal attire regulations in 1929, because no one promoted it, it has not been universally implemented in 1935. In fact, formal attire is very important. The so-called tidy clothes and hats, look like a Yan Ran, people look at it and return to it, this is the effect of formal attire. Let's talk about the quality of formal attire, of course silk is needed. Silk is a special product of China. The clothes and hats of the ancestral temples of all dynasties are all made of silk raw materials. Some people say that the blue robe and black mandarin jacket are corruption, this is a slanderous statement. Did Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty conquer the Western Regions and Yuan Shizu conquer the Great Qin, did they wear suits? Looking at the Japanese, they should be very inconvenient to wear clogs, but one foot has crossed into the four eastern provinces of our country. Chinese people have no self-confidence, like the boss who opens a cigarette factory, they like to eat茄力克 themselves, how can such a move have good results? I am not saying that the three names are inseparable from my profession, promoting domestic goods, we must implement it ourselves to have a way out.</p>

<p>Zhang Naiqi Speaks on the Evaluation of the New Village Movement On the afternoon of the 3rd of this month at 7:30 PM, the China New Village Construction Society held its first New Village lecture in the auditorium of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. 480 people attended. Economist Zhang Naiqi spoke on the evaluation of the New Village Movement, briefly stating that although there are many categories of knowledge and research in a society, they are all interconnected as a whole. In the past, researchers of a certain specialized issue often held biased views. Historically speaking, the New Village Movement originated from socialists who advocated utopianism. They wanted to create a new environment without reforming the existing society, hoping to abandon the old environment. However, due to the strong influence of the old environment, the newly created environment was often swallowed up. In the past, the failures of New Village Movement advocates in various countries were mostly due to this. Now, as far as I know, the members of the China New Village Construction Society are very clear about the overly idealistic nature of utopian socialism. The members of the society have realized the realities of urban expansion in economic life and want to solve the housing problem for urban people. They do not use high-sounding slogans such as transforming new societies to promote old societies, but only engage in practical efforts to solve the housing problem and personal economic life for the majority, which is possible. Because the society can enable everyone to take out the amount of consumption equal to living in the city and can turn consumption into appreciation, can periodically obtain real estate ownership and eliminate the burden of indefinite rent, the intention is excellent and the method is very simple, and the living environment is more comfortable, quiet and hygienic than in the city, this is the evaluation of the New Village Movement advocated by the members of the society. In addition, there is another point that can indirectly help urban households who have not joined the New Village, that is, because the New Village Movement advocates that most people are willing to move outside the city, the real estate in the city will inevitably fall in price and the rent will definitely be reduced accordingly, then on the one hand, the New Village residents have already obtained substantial benefits, and on the other hand, the urban residents have obtained more real benefits, which is truly a win-win situation.</p>

<p>The Invention of Xingpai Guonen Ke Lin Oral Tablets Gonorrhea, commonly known as leukorrhea, is the most difficult venereal disease to treat. Doctors are helpless, and patients suffer from it. Sometimes, ordinary drugs such as sandalwood oil and preparations such as替連藍莫瑟噴Blue are used for oral or injection administration, which can be effective for a while, but the gonorrhea bacteria lurking in the deep parts of the reproductive organs cannot be completely killed, so it occurs from time to time, and even patients think that it is incurable and leave it alone, which is a lifelong burden and extremely painful. Now, the Guonen Ke Lin oral tablets manufactured by the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory are made with pigment derivatives and refined using the latest scientific methods. They not only have strong bactericidal power but can also reach the deep parts of the reproductive organs. Therefore, gonorrhea after being cured with these tablets will never recur, and the pricing is low, which is especially cost-effective for individuals. As winter ends and spring approaches, it is the period when gonorrhea bacteria are most active after hibernation. Patients with this disease should pay special attention to it.</p>

<p>Commercial News, Finance, Exchange Market</p>
<p>Panic Selling Erupts, Standard Gold Plummeted Eleven Yuan</p>
<p>First Due to Mr. Luo's Desperate Selling, Market Weakened</p>
<p>Later, News of Central Bank Intervention Gradually Stabilized</p>
<p>The gold market was closed for three days for the New Year holiday. Yesterday was the first day of trading. Unexpectedly, the extreme hardening of the shilling rate triggered a wave of selling. Speculator Mr. Luo also engaged in desperate selling, leading to a sharp decline. A certain bank took the opportunity to maintain prices at the low end, and the market gradually stabilized after the drop. At the beginning of the morning, during the New Year holiday, overseas silver markets rose, but not significantly. London forward silver actually fell by 1.5 to 1.01 cents, and exchange rates also narrowed. London spot gold rose by seven pence, and sentiment was still good. Off-exchange pre-market trading opened, initially rising to 72.73 yuan. However, Kong Yin, a large seller, took advantage of the high prices to sell, and the price immediately retreated into the 70 yuan range. Although there was some struggle at this point, sentiment had already become weak and fatigued. The oversupply situation was extremely evident. The Central Bank's official exchange rates were announced, with the British pound unchanged and the U.S. dollar down by 0.0625. Customs gold units rose by eight li. The standard gold price was 996.40 yuan. Sentiment was unmoved. The market opened lower in the morning. Buyers took advantage of the low prices to become active, briefly pushing the price close to the 70 yuan mark. Although HSBC supported the shilling, it was difficult to rise further because the Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu was on the verge of collapse. Large sellers jointly sold off at the high prices, and there was a lack of buyers. The exchange market also loosened. Under the pressure of the selling wave, the gold price declined. Banks continued to support the market, but there was still some struggle after the drop. Subsequently, the Central Bank and the Bank of Japan successively offered gold, and the exchange market hardened, but it was still difficult to maintain. Many large long position holders also came out to sell, and the price broke through the 60 yuan mark. The silver equalization tax was announced and remained unchanged, still levied at 6.25%. The British exchange rate was calculated at one shilling and five pence and seventy-five. Although the market stabilized slightly at this point, Yuan Maoyong's repeated selling put further pressure on the buyers' side, and the downward trend remained strong. However, there were still many who took advantage of the low prices to buy, and individual investors followed suit one after another, making efforts to support the market. Therefore, even though large sellers continued to offer gold after that, the overall trend turned stable. However, it was difficult to sustain above 60 yuan. At noon, the exchange market had stabilized, and the gold market was also slightly healthier. Although the afternoon market opened flat, Sassoon, a Western merchant, unexpectedly dumped shillings, causing the domestic market to harden further. Speculator Mr. Luo continued to sell aggressively. Unfavorable rumors spread, and the price declined. A certain bank stepped in to buy, and buyers in the market also took advantage of the low prices to become active. Buying sentiment gradually recovered. Although there was some struggle along the way, the price gradually rebounded due to the enthusiastic buying and the sellers' covering their short positions. Indian silver, on the other hand, declined slightly. After entering the market, the price actually rebounded to above the 60 yuan mark. There was still a lot of supply at the high prices, and the price retreated slightly. Thereafter, the banks' appetite fluctuated between selling and supporting, and the exchange market stabilized. Buyers were active from time to time, and the market situation was quite stable, but it was difficult to break through the 60 yuan mark. In the end, supply and demand balanced, and the situation did not change significantly, resulting in a stagnant outcome. The day's market situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening price was 967.70 yuan, down 2.30 yuan compared to before the close. Fuyu, Fuxing, Yongrichang came in to buy, and the price rose from 7 yuan to 9.80 yuan. Although Qiao Zhifu offered shillings at 8.75 at this time, HSBC supported the market, and the situation was still stable. Shanghai offered March shillings at 25.</p>
<p>Fuxingyong, Yuanmaoyong, Yuli, Zhaofengchang, Hengyu, Dadecheng, Dingchang, Yuanchangyong, and others sold off, causing uncertainty, and the price fell to 3.70 yuan. Although Hengxing and Fuyu bought in at 5 yuan, the March shilling rate of 3125 was difficult to sell, and it retreated to 3.60 yuan. This selling was done by Fuxingyong and Dadecheng. However, Fuxingyong, Hengyu, Fuyu, and others took advantage of the low prices to take delivery, and the price rose to 4.60 yuan. Mitsui offered January U.S. dollars at 3125, and Yuan Yi, Fuxingyong, and Hengyu sold at 2.20 yuan, anticipating that HSBC's official exchange rates would be unchanged for the British pound and down 125 for the U.S. dollar, and sentiment stabilized slightly. Yongfeng, Dafa, Yongyuanmaoyong came in to buy, and the price rose to 3.30 yuan. Before long, Mitsui again offered January U.S. dollars at 3125, and the Central Bank offered spot shillings at 9375, triggering a wave of selling. Hengyu, Fuxingyong, Juchang, Richang, Yuanmaoyong, Zhaofengchang, and others came to sell, and the price broke through the 60 yuan mark, falling to 59.60 yuan. Fuxing and Dadecheng took advantage of the low prices to take delivery, and the price rose to above 60 yuan. The silver equalization tax was announced and remained unchanged. There was still some hesitation at this time. Yuanmaoyong continued to sell aggressively, making it difficult to rise further, and the price gradually declined from 0.08 yuan. Yuanmaoyong, Dafa, Yongzhaofengchang came to compete in selling. Banque Franco-Chinoise offered February shillings at 5625, and the Central Bank again offered spot shillings at five pence, causing the price to fall to 57.60 yuan. Qingyu, Taidecheng, Zhaofengchang, Tongtaichang, Hengyu came to buy and soon rebounded to above 60 yuan. Yuanmaoyong, Shunmaoyuan, Xianghui, and others continued to sell, and the domestic market continued to harden, falling to 57.80 yuan. Individual investors and Yuan Yi, Hengyu, and others bought slightly, rising to 139.60 yuan. Hengxingyuan, Zhaofengchang, Shunmao sold again at 8.30 yuan. Yuanchangyong and Yifengyong bought in, and Fuxingyong also took delivery, and the price rebounded to 60.07 yuan. Shunmao and others sold off, and the price retreated to 59.50 yuan. Shenkang bought in, and the price was able to maintain. After fluctuating, the noon closing price was 959.60 yuan. The market stabilized after the close. The afternoon market opened at 959.40 yuan, and soon rose to 9.70 yuan. Sassoon sold to Citibank April shillings at 25. Fuxingyong, Shunmao, Shenkang, Hengchangyong, and others sold to 6.20 yuan. Dadecheng and Xiangfeng took delivery, rising to 7.70 yuan. Sassoon still had offerings, and the exchange market hardened. Yuqingyong, Fuxingyong, Shenkangfushengyong, Qingfayong, Yuanmaoyong, Dachangxiang, Hengchangyong, and others sold again. Dadecheng and Xiangfeng bought in and then sold again, and April shillings had loosened to 375. Sassoon was still selling, and rumors circulated that Western merchants had borrowed £2 million, causing the price to fall to 4.70 yuan. The rumor that a certain bank was buying to cover positions stabilized the market. Changda, Fuxingyong, Dadecheng, Fuyu, Hengyu, Dalian Gang, Zhaofengchang, and others bought to 7 yuan. Although Yuqingyong, Bingxing, and others sold, there was some struggle, but because the Indian silver market initially telegraphed not to move, and Xiao Er'anna, Dafayong, Fuxingyong, Yongliyuanmaoyong, and others bought aggressively, the price rebounded to 60.08 yuan. Dingtai, Dingchang, Fuxingyongchang, Da Yuanchangyong, and others came to sell off, and the price fell to 58 yuan.

<p>Exchange Rate Decline Triggers British Exchange Selling</p>
<p>Central Bank, Qiao Zhifu, and Sassoon All Sell</p>
<p>Tian Exchange Market Results in Both British and U.S. Hardening</p>
<p>The exchange market was closed for three days for the New Year holiday. During this period of market closure, overseas telegrams indicated that London large bars rose by 0.0625 for both near and far terms, U.S. silver rose by 125, and the forward price of Montriuli fell by 1.5 to 1.05 cents. London spot gold rose by seven pence, the British pound fell against the U.S. dollar by 0.625, the U.S. dollar fell against the British pound by 1.625, the British pound fell against the French franc by 50 points, and the U.S. dollar rose against the French franc by 0.3125. The morning opening price for near-term selling was one shilling, four pence, and 8125, and for the U.S. dollar, 34.5625 yuan, which was unchanged for the British pound and tighter by 125 for the U.S. dollar compared to before the market closure, due to the decline in the exchange rate. The Central Bank's official exchange rates were announced, with the British pound unchanged and the U.S. dollar down by 0.0625, and customs gold rose by eight li. Sentiment was depressed after the opening, and Jewish merchants and others sold, causing the market to harden. However, because banks were still supporting, HSBC's official exchange rates were announced, with the British pound unchanged and the U.S. dollar down by 125, and there was still some fluctuation. The Central Bank and the Bank of Japan continued to supply, resulting in oversupply. Although the silver equalization tax was unchanged, the domestic market continued to harden. In the end, banks traded with each other, and the market stabilized slightly at noon. In the afternoon, Sassoon suddenly dumped shillings, and although banks had an appetite for buying, the situation loosened again due to oversupply. Chinese merchants took advantage of the low prices to buy in U.S. dollars, and the Indian silver market telegraphed a slight reduction, gradually stabilizing. In the end, banks again came to support the settlement, and the Indian silver market continued to reduce, making the process even smoother. At the closing, the spot selling price was one shilling, five pence, and 0625 for the British pound and 35 yuan for the U.S. dollar, which was looser by 25 for the British pound and tighter by 3125 for the U.S. dollar compared to before the market closure. Chinese merchants slightly sold off, and Western merchant Sassoon and Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu dumped shillings, and the Central Bank also sold spot dollars. The day's transactions are recorded below:</p>

<p>After the Opening of the Silver and Money Industry</p>
<p>The Money Supply Remains Tight</p>
<p>After the New Year holiday, the money industry resumed business the day before yesterday (the 3rd), and most of the banks reopened yesterday (the 4th). According to market conditions on the 3rd, foreign exchange rates were 0.55, the same as before the New Year. Yesterday's market also added water to the clearing, making the procedures extremely cumbersome. Many banks were suspected of settling accounts, so the market was more attractive than before the New Year. The opening price was initially 0.5, then changed to 0.6, and finally changed to 0.58, indicating that the tight money supply had not eased slightly. In terms of discount trading, the morning session had over 3.1 million in transfer accounts and over 2.3 million in new transactions. The afternoon session had over 300,000 in transactions. The small general association had over 800,000 in transactions. The total amount of foreign exchange collateral transactions, including withdrawals and new transactions, was about 2 million. In terms of bank settlements, foreign banks settled over 5.7 million in ticket payments, over 8.3 million in various exchange goods collateral payments, electronic settlements, and miscellaneous payments, over 5.3 million in supplementary handling of various payments during the market closure period, over 900,000 in special exchange payments, and 800,000 in warehouse entries. Chinese banks settled over 5.1 million in ticket payments, over 7.6 million in various exchange goods collateral payments, electronic tax settlements, and miscellaneous payments, over 4.4 million in supplementary handling of various payments during the market closure period, over 800,000 in special exchange payments, and 1 million in warehouse entries. Japanese banks settled over 4.9 million in ticket payments, over 9 million in various exchange goods collateral payments, electronic settlements, and miscellaneous payments, over 1.2 million in special exchange payments, and over 3.7 million in special handling of various settlement payments, and 800,000 in warehouse entries. Money shops settled over 55 million in foreign public orders, over 1.4 million in foreign exchange clearing payments, over 900,000 in various exchange payments, over 800,000 in banknote withdrawals, over 1.2 million in banknote issuances, over 600,000 in indemnity coupons, over 600,000 in cash settlements, and 400,000 in customer withdrawals. In addition, the total number of exchanges at the Shanghai Bankers Association Clearing House on the 4th was 12,083,111.37 silver dollars, including 6,930,092.41 silver dollars and 5,153,018.96 silver dollars in exchange transfers.</p>
<p>In addition, the public order discount interest rate of the joint reserve committee of the Shanghai Bankers Association on the 4th was 0.28 per thousand yuan per day, and the public order current rate was 0.35 per thousand yuan per day.</p>
<p>Copper Coins Fall Back 1,000 Cash</p>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small foreign coins were 850 yuan in both the morning and afternoon sessions, the same as the day before yesterday. The trading volume was 4,000 corners in the morning session and 3,000 corners in the afternoon session. Guangdong small foreign coins were 758.50 yuan in the morning session and 759.9 yuan in the afternoon session, an increase of only 0.4 yuan compared to the day before yesterday. The trading volume was 145,000 corners in the morning session and 65,000 corners in the afternoon session. Copper coins were 310,000 cash, a decrease of 1,000 cash compared to the day before yesterday. The trading volume was 40,300 strings of cash, equivalent to 13,000 foreign yuan.</p>
<p>Securities and Bond Market Constrained by Tight Money Supply</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange was the first red day of the 24th year. After a five-day holiday, there were no changes in the environment, but the foreign exchange rate did not ease, so sentiment could not be boosted. However, the trading volume in the market was not enthusiastic. The atmosphere was sluggish, and the market situation was depressed. Initially, the market was firm due to buying by numbers 50 and 53, but then weakened due to selling by the North Gang numbers 11 and 21. The overall trend remained weak. Although the bulls intended to raise prices, they lacked the strength to do so. As the Lunar New Year approached, the foreign exchange rate was not likely to ease in the short term. The rumor that HSBC would bring back 20 million was not realized, so the prospects were not promising in the short term. Yesterday's performance showed that individual investors sold heavily in the morning session due to the tight money supply. Buyers only included numbers 50 and 53, who had some appetite, so the market price was only firm in the front rows, and weakened further back. The tax-included forward price suddenly fell by half a yuan. The second session was slightly chaotic, with sparse entries and exits. The market situation was uncertain, with highs and lows fluctuating by about 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. In the afternoon, the clearing was done at 0.6 yuan, and sentiment turned weak. The North Gang sold more heavily, and number 21 also dumped, with the gold short position falling sharply by 0.45 yuan, and the rest also consistently fell by about 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. Before the close, the front rows made up for the decline by 0.2 to 0.45 yuan, and the back rows were stable. The overall trend remained weak, and the market price generally declined, ranging from 0.1 to 0.8 yuan. The total trading volume was 10,141,000 yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are listed below for comparison (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>Resurgence of Inflationary Sentiment, New York Stock Market Trends Upward</p>
<p>Xinfeng Yanghang reported that yesterday (the 3rd), the New York stock market trended upward, reflecting the submission of several inflationary proposals to Congress, such as the soldiers' bereavement pension case. Traders purchased gold mining stocks and so-called inflationary stocks. The bond market was generally stable, but due to the opening of Congress and the revival of inflationary sentiment, U.S. government bonds fell slightly. Small exchange stocks trended upward. The total trading volume for the day was 1.07 million shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>
<p>January 3rd January 4th Change</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 104.51 105.14 Up 0.63</p>

<p>Cotton Yarn and Gold Prices Fall, Yarn Market Attempts to Rise but Declines</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market began its New Year's trading on a red note. However, the market trend was up in the morning and down in the afternoon. During the four-day market closure, overseas cotton markets were firm, and sentiment was hopeful. Unexpectedly, the gold market fell back, and the cotton market was soft, which cooled down speculators. The market was not excited at all. Several blank boards were opened, indicating that the market situation was generally sluggish. However, the spot yarn sales market was able to maintain. The large buyers and sellers remained on the sidelines.</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Falls by Three, Four, Five Corners</p>
<p>Although the standard yarn market opened on a red note for the New Year, there was supposed to be a new atmosphere, but the market situation remained cold and weak. Due to the weak commercial situation in Shanghai and the tightening of finances, sentiment could not be stimulated. After a slight increase of 0.2 to 0.3 corners in the red market for standard yarn, news of falling gold prices and a depressed cotton market made the situation even more frustrating. Prices for all months fell by 0.3, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7 corners. It was found that 550 bales of Jifeng were sold, 1,600 bales of Ruidong, 350 bales of Junchang, 300 bales of Changfeng, 1,150 bales of Runkang, 350 bales of Tongji, 400 bales of Dafeng, 500 bales of Taixing, and 550 bales of Yuanyi were bought in. 750 bales of Gengfeng were bought in, 300 bales of Hengchang, 300 bales of Ye Chang, 500 bales of Xincheng, 750 bales of Yuanda, and 500 bales of Dachang. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Change Number of Accounts</p>
<p>January Contract 184.8 184.3 184.4 Down 0.30 41,550</p>
<p>February Contract 186.2 185.2 185.4 Down 0.40 47,000</p>

<p>Total 226,800</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Exceed 1,000 Bales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales were still good. Statistics show that all gangs bought more than 1,100 bales throughout the day. The market conditions were similar to the year-end prices. The buying volume of each gang is listed below:</p>
<p>Guangdong 425 Changsha 140 Fujian 5 Shantou 15 Anqing 10 Mainland 175 Sichuan 20 Yanhua 23 Yunnan 100 Ningbo 60 Zhenjiang 160</p>
<p>Sufficient Cotton Storage in Zhengzhou, Local Flower Market Suddenly Plummets After Rising</p>
<p>The cotton market initially rose and then fell. Before the market opened, most people expected an increase of several corners, because during the four-day market closure, U.S. cotton was stable, but Indian cotton rose by 4, 5, and 6 rupees, and the market price was expected to rise. Unexpectedly, the gold price fell, and there was sufficient storage of cotton in Hanzhou and Zhengzhou. The market was affected by the extremely tight money supply and fell. As a result, the virtual wind suddenly rose, and the market situation turned weak.</p>
<p>Standard Flowers Near Rising and Far Falling</p>
<p>The standard flower market opened in the front market, because it was resting during the New Year holiday, U.S. cotton was flat, but Indian cotton rose by 4, 5, and 6 rupees compared to before the market closure, and most people were optimistic about the rise, so prices for all months rose by 0.2 corners to 0.15 corners. When it came to the second and third sessions, the news that the gold price was falling suddenly fell, and there was a saying that the cotton price in Zhengzhou had fallen by more than 3 yuan (but the reporter conducted a thorough investigation on all sides and said that the storage there was indeed large, and the market price was affected by the money supply, and the price per load fell by about 1 yuan). As a result, prices for all months rose by 0.05 to 0.125 corners. In the afternoon, because the gold price fell to more than 50 yuan, the selling pressure in the market increased again, and prices for all months fell by 0.12 corners to... It was found that 1,600 loads of Changyu were sold, 4,500 loads of Ruidong, 1,000 loads of Junchang, 3,000 loads of Runkang, 2,100 loads of Changhe, and 900 loads of Yongchang were bought in. 1,900 loads of Hengyi were bought in, 1,000 loads of Junchang, 2,000 loads of Shenchang</p>

<p>In the mediation office, the district chief sat on the rattan chair in the center, with the landlord and the gold panners sitting opposite each other on both sides. (They are here to dig for gold at Dajiaotian again. Last time, the police chief himself went there to persuade them to disperse, but the fields were all ruined. Now they are coming again. District Chief! What kind of world is this?) The landlord, looking very agitated, said in a tense and hurried voice. (They are still acting recklessly, even using soil to bury the rice seedlings to death.) (Why are you being so unreasonable? The government has already issued a decree prohibiting the use of tax fields and forests. Don't you know that you are breaking the law? Even if... you should ask your conscience, can you live with it?) The district chief questioned the gold panners. (Why don't you go panning in the barren hills and wastelands?) (Yes, we've panned in the barren hills and wastelands, but there's nothing there. The gold just happens to be in the fields. We can't help it. Although we've seen the notice, we're afraid of starving to death... we still have our families to feed?) (District Chief, you must punish them.) (Breaking the law should be punished, do you understand?) the district chief said. (District Chief! For the sake of conscience and to survive, we pan for gold.) (Besides panning for gold, can't you make a living? So many people don't pan for gold, and they don't all starve to death.) (Panning for gold is the same as working. It shows that we're not unwilling to work, but when we look for work, no one wants to hire us. No one buys firewood or grass. In these long days of May, we're starving for days.) said the gold panner. (Now our gold beds and gold buckets have been smashed by them. District Chief! These are our lives. We hope the District Chief will uphold justice and make them pay compensation.) (Our fields, our rice, how will you compensate us?) The district chief pondered for a moment, his temper flaring up a bit; (Other people's tax fields have to pay grain and taxes and are protected by law. You openly dig them up, have you paid any compensation? Do you think that only your gold beds and gold buckets are protected by special laws?) (But those are our lives.) ... Knowing that such disputes are unsolvable, the district chief had no choice but to resort to the established law, the "one strike, two separate" method: (Alright! There's no need for either side to say more, everyone disperse. You must not pan in tax fields again in the future.)</p>
<h3 id="e94">Casual Words from the Study: Philosopher <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>On Knowledge and Concepts</p>
<p>Knowledge originates from the understanding of objective existence, that is, the acquisition of concepts; knowledge is nothing more than the gathering, analysis, and categorization of concepts to discover their commonality and particularity, and to discover the laws of the movement of things through the relationships between concepts. Therefore, the quantity of knowledge depends on the quantity of concepts, and the quality of knowledge is determined by the quality of concepts. To make our knowledge rich and accurate, we must first make our concepts rich and accurate, so examining the process of acquiring concepts would not be superfluous. The acquisition of concepts is usually due to experience and books, and the path is sensation and reflection. We acquire the concept of white through the response of the visual nerve to white, and similarly acquire concepts such as triangle, fragrance, and speed through the sensation's response to the breadth, nature, and movement of things; at the same time, we acquire the concept of man, the concept of existence and entity, and all other higher-level complex concepts through reflection. The vagueness of our concepts affects the clarity of knowledge, and the fragmentation and incompleteness of our concepts also make our knowledge lack a system, which is the most common mistake we make. Why do we have vague and fragmented concepts? Partly due to congenital defects in sensory perception, and partly due to the inability to concentrate attention. A person who is born deaf will never be able to acquire the concept of musical scales and timbres, and therefore will not have musical knowledge; if he can have knowledge of sound, he will acquire it from books, recite it, and it will not be knowledge that is knowledge. Strictly speaking, it is impossible for a person who has no concept of sound at all to read and memorize the definitions and principles in an introduction to music, right? Even if he reads it reluctantly, he will not understand its meaning. Can that still be considered knowledge? As for a person who is born nearsighted, his concept of stars and celestial bodies will naturally be very vague or even incorrect. Such a person, no matter how many books on astronomy he reads, will still be unable to become an astronomer. However, if a person with healthy senses is inattentive, he will neglect many concepts within a system, thus lacking many intermediate concepts, and his knowledge cannot but be fragmented, or even if it is not fragmented, it cannot but be vague. This is especially true when acquiring knowledge from books. We often read books very casually, without seeking to understand the concepts provided by the books, or even wanting to remember them at all, and later, when reading more advanced books, we are unable to understand the ideas within. In addition to these two errors, we also have faulty memory and faulty judgment, both of which are enough to distort our knowledge. We often link unrelated concepts together because of errors in memory and errors in judgment. The reason why great thinkers can discover the truth is because of the clarity of their memory and the clarity of their judgment, so that all concepts have a correct connection. When a person completely loses memory and judgment, his concepts are linked together in a very strange way, and he becomes insane. If we want to make our concepts rich and correct, we must constantly acquire new concepts, often concentrate our attention on concepts, cultivate memory and judgment, arrange concepts in a correct system, and maintain appropriate relationships.</p>
<h3 id="e95">The Mind of an Old Man: Xi Si <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>(I feel more and more desolate, the mind of an old man who is not yet old!) Recently, I often inexplicably sigh to myself like this. Then, in an instant, I ask myself again: I am still young, why does my soul feel so dim? But I cannot say the reason why, I just clearly know that my mind is getting older day by day. The intense attachment and interest of young people have completely disappeared. Therefore, I am dragging a young body but not a young, old heart, trudging along. Because of the dimness of my mind, all the people and things, all the scenery displayed before my eyes are also covered with a layer of dim color. Therefore, I particularly like a solitary and lonely life, often alone, all day long, guarding in a small room, pacing back and forth. Sometimes I walk to the window, look up at the shadows of the clouds in the sky, lightly sketching various beautiful patterns, silently gazing for a long time. As dusk approaches, this natural scenery is another kind of attachment. The sunset drags the tired, light rays of the sun, dyeing red a corner of the western sky, and gilding the distant woods. At this time, perhaps a flock of returning crows occasionally flies across the sky, heavily throwing down a string of desolate cries, which in this desolate and peaceful dusk, heavily falls into my delicate nerves. After the color of night has completely painted down, I silently close the window. I use such a lonely mood to accompany a lonely mind, passing the days in such loneliness. My mind is really old. If I don't have to step out of the door, I can spend a long time without leaving this room. Every day, from morning to night, I look at the clouds in the sky, look at the evening scenery at sunset. Although the situation is somewhat similar to the desolate atmosphere of an ancient temple, I am precisely fascinated by such a desolate, yet elegant and beautiful situation. I would rather spend long days confined in a small room, letting boundless loneliness lock me in. Let loneliness, like a worm, quietly gnaw at my soul. I don't want to mix in crowded and bustling places, laughing because others laugh, and rejoicing because others rejoice. What makes me particularly embarrassed is when I hear something that seems to contain infinite concern and sigh for me, saying: You seem older these days! You should take a break. When these words enter my ears, I have no regret. My old mind cannot be understood by others! When I am old, I should have the golden dreams and golden ideals that young people have. But now I have none of them, not even the smallest hope. I just watch helplessly as the venomous god of fate tramples on the petals of my youth, waiting for my youth, which has never been brilliant, to gradually wither away. In this way, I use my old mind, without emotional prolongation, to pass the years. Seeing the yellow leaves falling, I know that autumn has come. Hearing the orioles whispering in the flowers, I know that late spring is near. Each season comes and goes in a hurry, but these have nothing to do with me. There is no spring and no autumn. I only have a stagnant, never-ending, faded, old mind!</p>
<h3 id="e96">Wife's Transformation: A Le <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>My wife's recent behavior is really hard to figure out. Sometimes she seems quite happy, repeatedly talking about the scenes of a few years ago when we were completely immersed in the trap of love, talking and talking, and finally, she would pounce on me and bite me. But sometimes she is so depressed, lying in bed, sleeping all day long. If I ask her: (Are you feeling unwell?) She always shakes her head and says: (No.) (Then why are you sleeping all day?) (If I'm not sleepy, what's the point?) (Go out and play for a while, don't sleep yourself sick.) I walk over and sit on the edge of the bed. She turns over, faces inward, pulls the quilt over her head, and says: (Nag, nag, nag, I want to sleep.) My wife has really become very strange recently. Her cold face is gradually increasing, and she always sneaks out alone when I go to the company. When I ask her where she is going, she always speaks hesitantly. Either a friend from the north is coming to meet her, or a relative is coming to find her to go to the cinema together. If I ask further what the relative's name is or where the friend lives, she stares at the ceiling, thinks for a while, and then says it. She went out again today. According to the usual practice, today is particularly busy, and I usually don't come back until around 7 or 8 pm. But today is an exception. The company doesn't have that much work to do, so I came back a little earlier. Maybe she still thinks I'm buried in work! I sit alone in the house, as if sitting on pins and needles. My heart feels strangely anxious, and a kind of unbearable shame immediately floats into my mind. Angrily, I slam the table with my hand and curse: (Damn it, she's hooking up with a man.) But I immediately regret it, cursing myself for not speculating on my own wife like that. In any case, she would not abandon me. If she were to abandon me today, there would not have been so much love for me back then. Thinking of this, my anxious and angry mood slowly relaxes. However, the short hand of the clock on the table is running forward quickly, and the sky is also darkening, but she has not yet returned. Where did she go? I start to feel anxious again. The thought that I had just cursed myself for not speculating on her like that is now shaken. I suddenly remember that I can always find some evidence from her clothes pocket or drawer, so I open the wardrobe, rummage around in her cheongsams and blouses for a while, pull out the drawer, search it, and finally find nothing. Just at this moment, she comes in. She sees the clothes scattered on the chair and the drawer open, and the clever her immediately understands what I mean. (Why are you searching everywhere?) Her face has no goodwill at all. A surge of anger rises in my heart, and I randomly throw her cheongsam and throw it at her face. She falls to the bed and starts to cry loudly.</p>

See the moon season flowers blooming, the first month full of the moon. Some watch the flowers in Nanmo, singing slowly. Some wait for the moon in Xixiang, the night deep and silent. Some stand on the flower steps, facing the moon and wind. Some draw flowers and fetch water in the moon palace. The most laughable is the lunar eclipse, with ten thousand families rushing to the rescue. The most enviable is celebrating the birthday of a hundred flowers, worshiping the flower god. At this moment, the medicine railing flowers are blooming, red fragrance warm. Waiting for the moon country fragrance to drift, the osmanthus dew to fall. You must know that spring has come to the world, flowers are beautiful. You must know that the moonlight is bright, the moon is clear. There are generations of flowers standing along the door. There are generations of planting flowers, attracting butterflies to neighboring gardens. I am seeking fragrance and moon, picking plum blossoms.

<h3 id="e99">*Shen Bao* Local Supplement: Film Special - The Reason Why “New Type” People Have Difficulty Being Filmed <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Combination of Special Features Creates the Chimera Face Type.</p>
<p>Illusions of Preconceived Notions Dominate Audience Preferences.</p>
<p>In a company, a meeting was convened. Seven or eight magnates gathered in a large conference hall. There, a long and wide conference table was situated, surrounded by high-backed chairs, and the floor was covered with a thick Beijing carpet. Everyone was smoking cigars, and when one person spoke, several others chatted amongst themselves in whispers. In this way, they handled several routine matters. Suddenly, a person stood up and proposed a motion. The motion was based on sound reasoning, repeatedly tested and proven, and unlikely to ever be overturned. However, that person did not need to make a solemn matter of it. Only when everyone's idle chatter had subsided and they were all ears, did he raise his voice to speak: "What our film industry urgently needs at the moment is new faces!" Sure enough, everyone sat up straight, and even stopped smoking their cigars, indicating their complete attention and agreement to this issue. Soon, they relaxed somewhat again, resuming their whispering and secret conversations. But the motion to seek out new types of people was eventually unanimously passed.</p>
<p>How to seek out new types of people then became the most important issue at hand. Of course, film industry magnates could not stand on the street and select new types of people from the passing pedestrians. However, they all felt that once something was worth wanting, it was worth seeking out with all their might. Thus, a detailed plan was drawn up. Many plans were made, and beauty contests were the most common and effective, because in addition to the positive effect of selecting the desired object, there were many side effects, such as the sensational publicity effect on society, etc. So they decided to adopt the beauty contest approach. The newspapers of major cities were invited to participate in the grand event together. Their news editors were, of course, happy to agree, because they knew that any news about the women's world would certainly cause a sensation in society.</p>
<p>Soon, a new list had been drawn up – Miss Kansas City, Miss Valley Forge, and so on. But this time, it was slightly different from all previous ones. In addition to the essential beauty, the qualifications of this group of ladies also included a special charm, which was the so-called new type of face. This group of beauties with new types of faces then gathered together in a warm place on one day. They were all dressed in exquisite and form-fitting bathing suits, each one elegant and charming, with a thousand kinds of grace and beauty. After exhibiting themselves to the public, they each received a train ticket to Hollywood and a contract from a film company, filled with ant-sized characters, all terms and conditions. They also had no time to read it in detail.</p>
<p>This group of beauties cheerfully traveled together to Hollywood. The film company magnates then subjected them to a detailed review one by one. Sure enough, this selection was uniquely insightful and extraordinary. Although one of them looked somewhat like Joan Crawford from afar, they thought that she would certainly be eliminated on her own in the future, so they did not take it to heart. But when the three-month trial period was over, nineteen of the twenty new beauties were useless and had to be sent home with one-way train tickets. Only the twentieth one, who usually looked somewhat like Joan Crawford, was simply indistinguishable from Joan in front of the camera. She was kept because she was photogenic. The others, compared to her, were more beautiful and had better figures, but they were all failures. Why? No one wanted to get to the bottom of it. Fortunately, it was clear that they were not popular, so what was the point of getting to the bottom of it?</p>
<p>According to Yuan, Chimera was a faithful reporter, but for some reason, Lidi's fair beauty was always considered more radiant than Aina's dark beauty when reprinted on film, even though Aina's true beauty was indeed far superior to Lidi's. Furthermore, the combination of several facial features is not necessarily called beauty, but it is very easy to be filmed. Large eyes, high cheekbones, a wide forehead, and a pointed chin, when combined, create a Chimera face. However, what has been said above is still just empty talk, difficult to define. What is most important, even more important than beauty, is an illusion, an illusion of exoticism, an illusion of health, an illusion of elegance, an illusion of mystery, and so on. So, Clara Bow had the illusion of "it" and she had the key to film fame and did not have to worry about not succeeding. Of course, illusion is also not something that can be grasped concretely. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e100">Film Review: *Cleopatra*: Ji Han <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>*Cleopatra* – Da Guangming</p>
<p>Cecil B. DeMille! This master of the silver screen is truly too familiar to Chinese audiences. He expresses each of his plays with a heavy hand. In his films, there are grand scenes, large crowds, a heavy atmosphere, all of which demonstrate his magnificent power. These, from *The Sign of the Cross* to *Cleopatra*, all demonstrate his unique style.</p>
<p>People will not forget that Cecil B. DeMille is a religious filmmaker. At the same time, it can be said that he is a historical dramatist. From a religious point of view, a writer who serves religion is by no means an accidental attempt. Due to *The Ten Commandments*, *The King of Kings*, and *The Sign of the Cross*, etc., they all illustrate that he is a faithful preacher of Christianity. It is said that the Roman Pope once gave him a large amount of money as a reward, and he has a very honorable position in the Vatican. But from another perspective, the reason why he adopts religious themes is perhaps because he is very interested in tragic stories. This can be proved by his production of *The Godless Girl* or the historical drama *Cleopatra*, because there are no religious colors in them. In addition, there is also the slightly satirical *The Plainsman*, which is not for religious preaching, although the idea of imperialism in invading colonies is quite strong in the work.</p>
<p>It is very clear that none of Cecil B. DeMille's works does not express his old conceptual form. Today, he should be called a gentleman. As far as this work is concerned, the so-called historical narrative certainly has its effect on Cecil B. DeMille today. For example, Queen Cleopatra of Egypt wants to marry Caesar, the King of Rome. She hopes that Egypt and Rome can live in peace. The so-called idea that the King of Egypt should submit to Rome is ridiculed here. Furthermore, the significance of peace is expressed in General Antony, who breaks his spear to show his determination. But at the same time, it shows that the so-called military actions of radical elements attacking Egypt destroyed the so-called peace, and the Queen and Antony died for their country as a result.</p>
<p>In all aspects, this film is quite satisfactory to people, grand, sublime, and the enchanting charm of women. However, in terms of film art, the so-called change of style by the author, inserting modern dances into ancient history, will not but be criticized. However, it must be said that when people describe ancient history, it is like painting a ghost. Who can decide that the ghost is not painted realistically?</p>
<h3 id="e101">Review of (College Rhythm): You Jing <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>"College Rhythm" – Cathay Film Co.</p>
<p>(Sweet and gorgeous songs), (joyful and silly laughter), (beautiful and graceful women, romance), and everything else that can be used to embellish and provide forgetful enjoyment of this New Year of 1935, are fully applied, summoned, and enjoyed in this College Rhythm. Naturally, the whole world has spent 1934 in turmoil, thrills, worries, and madness. Although it is well known that everything that comes with this 1935 may be even more unpleasant, in these first few days, let's put aside everything and have a perverted amount of fun. Who can say anything? Therefore, films such as *Transatlantic Merry-Go-Round*, *The Merry Widow*, and this *College Rhythm* are used to embellish and respond to the times. Responding to the New Year holiday in this Eastern metropolis | Shanghai |.</p>
<p>As we follow the crowded group of nobles to watch this College Rhythm, we can't help but feel that what this film expresses, no matter how much sweet music, wild laughter, and sexual romance are used to cover up and intersperse, inevitably reveals the original face of this society. Such as football, and various other sports are also rigidified by this social system, and the original meaning of people going to exercise, the athletic performers are turned into commodities to make money for others, and due to economic panic, overproduction, followed by the poor living of the laboring masses, the consumer purchasing power is so low that it is impossible to be lower, the commercial depression formed in the so-called learned people, no matter how they use rationalized theories and methods to manage, to reform, they are also (business is greatly declining) and have to use (players with 85,000 fans) to call, in order to seek deformed (excellent results, business is booming) and other facts.</p>
<p>Speaking of the technical success of this film, there are naturally things that we cannot deny. From the casting of (the so-called scholars who work hard at books) and (the football players who have no real learning) to the attitudes of the two rival shop owners, they have all properly achieved a successful situation. In the noisy scenes of the football field, banquet party, and the opening of the department store, the application of air control and sound effects is excellent. However, the emphasis on the cheerleader's performance and many dance numbers in the store are exaggerated too much, forming a disproportion in the overall amount of the film. For the sake of excitement, they do not hesitate to over-emphasize certain scenes, which is a common problem with many Hollywood films without content. Therefore, the so-called excitement in College Rhythm is just excitement.</p>
<p>The actors have done as much as they should in such a script. Among them, Lanny Ross's performance of Riley is more profound. The so-called Miss Shanghai, Lyda Roberti, appears here as a clown, and there is not much to admire.</p>
<p>United Artists' new film, *Transatlantic Merry-Go-Round*, is Sweet Sister Neisse Carle's most successful work. Not only is the song and dance novel, but the plot is even better. All countries consider it a spectacle of song and dance films this year.</p>

<p>John Frank Mitchell, everyone calls him (Cover Mitchell), is a giant of the American West Coast press. He has extensive power and courage, and can be described as an uncrowned king. At this time, he was drinking coffee in the study of his palace-like residence. Before he finished a cup of coffee, he roared into the telephone receiver and said: (I don't care what his merits are! I want you to fire that guy || Did you hear me? What kind of police chief is this? || Want to arrest me, saying that I was driving too fast || Even after telling him who I am, he doesn't care. His name? Haven't I already told you? || Taylor Conden. That's right, I want you to fire him, the sooner the better. Very good.) After he finished speaking, he slammed the telephone receiver down, and his eyes flickered fiercely.</p>
<p>At the other end of the table, his daughter, named Qiong, was putting up a silk-like long leg and swaying it. She smiled as she watched her father get angry. In fact, she was the only one who could say a few words in front of her father without trembling. Now it was her turn to speak again. She listened to her father's words, and although she didn't know who this Taylor Conden was, she admired his courage for daring to be so presumptuous in front of her father. She thought it was funny that her father would actually be upset by a policeman. She changed her mind, and then opened her mouth and said to her father: (Dad, it's funny to say, it's as if the police department was set up</p>
<h3 id="e103">Measures to Protect Local Sugar in Guangdong Province <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>|Changes to Inspection Areas by the National Products Office|</p>
<p>Correspondent from Shantou reports: Since the National Products Promotion Office established by the provincial government implemented new measures to protect locally produced sugar, rural sugar producers have been subjected to various forms of oppression. The Chaozhou Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai, the Shantou Sugar Industry Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Puning Fellow Townsmen Association in Shantou, and the Chaoyang Fellow Townsmen Association in Shantou have all recognized the difficulty in implementing these new measures and have successively telegraphed the Department of Construction to strongly advocate for their revision. The Department of Construction then ordered the National Products Office in Shantou to investigate and respond. The Shantou National Products Office considered the measures absolutely necessary; therefore, the Department of Construction refused to revoke its decision. Consequently, the National Products Office issued a revised announcement regarding the protection of local sugar, stating: (To prevent the smuggling of protected local sugar, it is necessary to inspect all sugar slabs and sugar pieces transported for sale from various districts to determine their authenticity and prevent adulteration with foreign sugar. However, many farmers and merchants in various districts do not understand this intention. Any inspection leads to suspicion and concern, causing unnecessary alarm among local sugar merchants, which is regrettable. Therefore, we are making slight adjustments to the inspection methods. Local sugar from areas far from the sea with less smuggling, such as the upper reaches of the Northwest River and districts north of the East River,</p>
<p>upon arrival in this city, will be exempt from inspection. For sugar products from coastal areas, such as Dongguan, Sanshui, Gaoyao, the Five Districts [Xinhui, Taishan, Kaiping, Enping, Heshan], Liangyang, Nan[hai], Fan[yu], Zhong[shan], Shun[de], Chao[zhou], Pu[ning], Hui[yang], Rao[ping], Haifeng, Lufeng, and districts near Hong Kong and Macau, samples must be taken according to regulations and sent to the Guangzhou First District Sugar Manufacturing Plant for chemical analysis to determine their authenticity.) Furthermore, the Guangdong sugar industry has been impacted by the government's strict control measures. A significant amount of local sugar in Guangzhou has been detained. Among those already analyzed and penalized, on December 12th, Qingyuan Wu Xinghao's 1,352 catties were found to be half adulterated with foreign sugar, resulting in confiscation and a fine of 42 yuan, 8 jiao, and 1 cent. Xiang Xinghao, transported by the Benyuan Company from Haikou, had 1,457 catties, also found to be half adulterated with foreign sugar, receiving the same penalty as above. Heng Dehao from Hanguangxu in Yingde, weighing 1,840 catties, was found to be entirely foreign sugar upon analysis. As it had already been sold, a sugar price of 118 yuan and 4 hao was to be paid. Wan Yuantaihao, transported from Dianbai, had 800 catties, found to be mostly adulterated with foreign sugar, and was fined two-thirds of the sugar price, totaling 58 yuan, 6 hao, and 7 cents. Additionally, Shui Dong Tailaihao transported 450 catties, and since the sugar had already been sold, a price of 49 yuan and 5 hao was to be paid. Many other firms have also had their goods seized. Sugar merchants, dissatisfied, jointly requested the Department of Construction to abolish the factory exit law, stating that all sugar slabs transported from various districts are made from sugarcane juice from the fields. They are now being fined or having their goods confiscated entirely. Without prior clear announcements from the Department regarding distinguishing samples of foreign sugar, local sugar, and mixtures of foreign sugar, the current analysis is neither transparent nor accurate. The results of the analysis of the penalized local sugar are based on approximate judgments, which is unfair and difficult to accept. However, with the precedent for fines established, and local sugar increasingly restricted, the government-operated national sugar should be able to expand its sales.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Introduction of Yellow River Water into Huiji in Henan Province <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>River Dredging Completed</p>
<p>Project Nearing Completion</p>
<p>Correspondent from Kaifeng reports: The project to divert Yellow River water into the Huiji River, organized by the Department of Construction, has been underway for over three years since dredging the Huiji River began at the end of the twentieth year. The project is now nearing completion. A summary is provided below. The Huiji River originates from the nursery of the Department of Construction in the southeastern corner of Kaifeng city and ends in Tuocheng, passing through Chenliu, Qixian, and Suixian, covering a total distance of 137 kilometers. The dredging project was initiated in December of the twentieth year and completed in August of the twenty-second year, involving the excavation of 4,964,600 cubic meters of earth, the construction of six new bridges, the renovation of five bridges, and the construction of 130 culverts. However, the soil on both banks of the river is mostly sandy and requires irrigation to produce abundant crops. Due to insufficient water in the Huiji River, a plan was formulated to supplement the water source after dredging to facilitate irrigation for the farmland on both banks. A new river was opened from the Erdao Dike in Kaifeng, passing through Beishan Village, Nanshan Village, crossing the city wall, passing through Zhongguanzhuang and Sun Li Tangzhuang, to the western gate of Kaifeng, and then turning southeast to the nursery of the Department of Construction in the southeastern corner of the city, reaching the Huiji River. It is 13,300 meters long and named the Huanghui River. Sluice gates were installed at the Erdao Dike river mouth and where it crosses the city wall for control. The above excavation and sluice gate projects have long been completed. Furthermore, a canal was opened from each of Liuyuankou and Heigangkou, connecting to the water pools of the dikes at these two locations and joining the Huanghui River at the Erdao Dike river mouth, named the Liuyuankou Water Diversion Canal and the Heigangkou Water Diversion Canal respectively, to divert accumulated water from the water pools inside the dikes at these two locations to the Huanghui River and supplement the Huiji River's source. A sluice gate was also trial-installed where the Heigangkou Water Diversion Canal crosses the dike to prevent accidents. Additionally, two sets of siphon pipes were installed on the Liuyuankou Dike, and six sets of siphon pipes were installed on the Heigangkou Dike to draw water from the Yellow River into the water pools. After clarification, the water flows through the diversion canals into the Huanghui River to supplement the water source. The siphon pipes have an inner diameter of 6 inches and a length of about 160 meters each. The eight sets have been fully installed, with a total outflow of over 6 cubic meters per second. The Liuyuankou siphon pipes are now fully installed, and the Heigangkou siphon pipes are about to be installed. Both water diversion canals have started construction and can be fully completed within a month. However, the area of farmland along the Huiji River awaiting irrigation is vast, and the amount of water diverted by these siphon pipes is minimal, requiring further expansion to meet the needs. Moreover, the water within the city of Kaifeng stagnates, and the soil along the lakes and rivers is highly saline. To remove pollutants and improve the soil quality, the Department of Construction specially opened a branch canal on the eastern bank of the Huanghui River at Sun Li Tangzhuang, diverting water through the northwestern corner of the city. A water gate was built where it passes through the city, equipped with new-style gates for opening and closing, named the Libian Gate. Water flows eastward from the Libian Gate into the Pan Yang Lake, dividing into two branches. One branch follows the city southward, then turns eastward at the southwestern corner of the city, heading straight to the Shuimen Gate in the eastern part of the city. This Shuimen Gate has also been renovated and equipped with new-style gates, named the Jiliang Gate. The other branch passes through Pan Yang Lake, follows the city eastward to near the Kaifeng Meteorological Station, then turns southward, merging with the other branch before the Shuimen Gate. After the two branches merge, they pass through the Shuimen Gate and flow into the Huiji River. Currently, all sections of the river channels are unobstructed. After the channels were opened, bridges were built over the rivers and canals for transportation convenience, including three bridges over the Yuankou Water Diversion Canal, five bridges over the Heigangkou Water Diversion Canal, four bridges over the Huanghui River, four bridges over the section of the river from Sun Li Tangzhuang to the Libian Gate, and 24 bridges over the Huiji River within the city. These bridges are either completed or under construction and will soon be fully completed. To facilitate drainage on both banks of the river, over a hundred culverts are being gradually constructed and will be completed soon. From now on, the cityscape of Kaifeng can be improved, and the farmland along the Huiji River will no longer have to worry about drought. (December 30th)</p>

<p>The Provincial Anti-Opium Association previously sent personnel to Suzhou, where they uncovered a large-scale opium den at No. 17 Yong'an Lane outside Xumen. Over ten opium offenders were arrested on the spot. Patrol Officer Fang Ying of the First Precinct of the Third Bureau was suspected of protecting the den. The Provincial Anti-Opium Association reported this to the provincial government, which in turn instructed the Department of Civil Affairs to dismiss Fang Ying. Xu Shulian, the Chief of the Third Bureau, was also deemed culpable. The county was ordered yesterday to investigate and handle the matter.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Yuan Yuan Farm has a branch company in Dingjia Lane outside Xumen in Suzhou. Due to having over forty client households in Wujiang, they specifically sent employee Yin Ronghai on the second to collect payments. He was returning to Suzhou via the Sujia Road in a rented car when, upon reaching the first bridge north of Jiapu Bridge (i.e., the fifth bridge south of Baodai Bridge), he saw six people on the bridge who ordered him to stop, claiming they wanted to buy the Wuxian Daily. Yin replied that he was not a newspaper vendor. The six people immediately rushed forward, pushed the car off the road, and dragged Yin into a small boat. They robbed him of all the collected payments, totaling forty-four yuan and eight jiao, a robe, and a pair of cotton pants. They bound his hands, rowed two or three li to a desolate spot, threw Yin onto the riverbank, and then sailed back into Taihu Lake in the same boat. Yin later escaped back to where he had been robbed, where he found the car still there, but it had been vandalized with knives.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Ten Years Imprisonment for Selling Poison Pills <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>On July 26th of last year, the Inspection Office of the Municipal Public Security Bureau apprehended three individuals, Zhang Wu, Zhang Miao, and Lu Afu, for selling poison pills at No. 22 Heng Street in Ximen. They also seized two hundred gray poison pills and thirty red poison pills. They were escorted to the county government and then transferred to the Zhenjiang Garrison Headquarters. After a thorough interrogation by military judge Zou Dian, Zhang Wu was found guilty of violating Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations for Strict Prohibition of Potent Narcotics and sentenced to life imprisonment. Considering the woman's ignorance and the fact that her husband, Zhang Aquan (who is still at large), was the principal offender, and in accordance with Article 14 of the same regulations, Article 77 and Article 80, Section 2 of the Criminal Law were applied, reducing the sentence by half to ten years of imprisonment. Zhang Miao's suspicion of aiding and abetting was insufficient, and a verdict of innocence was pronounced in accordance with Article 316 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Lu Afu was using poison pills and, in accordance with Article 5 of the above regulations, was returned to the original county to be sent to a hospital for mandatory rehabilitation. The decision was approved by the Nanchang Headquarters and sent back to the county government yesterday for execution.</p>

<p>The former Second Company Commander of the Security Team, Liao Zhiyuan, was dismissed from his position, and the vacancy was filled by Yu Quangui, appointed by the provincial committee. During the handover, it was suddenly discovered that a box cannon had been lost. According to the statement of Secretary Yao Zhengjia, it had been borrowed by the former Security Team Leader, Fan Zhengshan, and subsequently sold. The team considered the matter significant and detained former Team Leader Fan for interrogation. Fan consistently denied the accusation. The team then submitted a request to the province for instructions. Subsequently, Fan's wife, Ms. Yu Jianru, appealed to the province for assistance. As Fan had been appointed to a position in the Qingpu County Security Team, the Provincial Security Department investigated and determined that he had been falsely accused. The province ordered the county to release him. Now that the county has received the order, Fan has been released. Secretary Yao is responsible for compensating for the lost firearm. Fan is scheduled to take office in Qingpu on the fifth.</p>

<p>Over forty national product factories in Shanghai organized a mobile exhibition to promote national products and display them in various inland areas. The exhibition arrived in Changshu at the beginning of last month and set up stalls in the area of the old Chenghuang Temple. The opening ceremony took place on the tenth.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, since the opening, the weather has been unfavorable, with continuous rain for nearly half a month, resulting in poor business. From the opening until now, the total turnover has been only over twelve thousand yuan. Due to high expenses, it has been decided to close on the fifth and move the exhibition to Yixing. Some manufacturers had already closed their stalls and left on the third.</p>

<p>Ships operating on the Shanghai route, due to the lack of docks in various ports of this county, require ferry boats to transport passengers and cargo. The fares for these ferry boats have never been clearly regulated, leading to arbitrary extortion by boat operators, causing hardship for travelers. County residents Pan Huanwen, Lu Boheng, and others submitted a petition to the provincial government to strictly crack down on this practice. Yesterday (the 29th), the provincial government ordered the county government to investigate and stop this practice promptly and to draft reasonable fare rates for the ferry routes in each port, taking into account the distance, and submit them for approval.</p>
