<h3>英向美法日建議國際對華貸欵</h3>
<p>旨在阻止中日經濟聯盟</p>
<p>英美提携已有切實表示</p>
<p>［倫敦］英國政府頃已要求美法日本三國政府提出供給中國財政援助之建議、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］英國以中國金融恐慌、特分邀美國日本法國以及其他國家、作共同援助中國之事業，此間當局以爲此一行動、目的非在阻止中日關係之調整、因中日恊調之事、此間絶無正式消息獲得也、唯英國極願對中國作大模規之任何援助、此間官塲承認、英國今次所邀各國即爲前曾參加一九二零年國際銀行之各國、特目今不必更須利用此一組織耳、英國今次所以發起此項援助中國之運動、實出於上海中外銀行之請求、英政府鑒於中國金融恐慌之嚴重、深覺此一運動之不可再緩、故一方接受上海方面之建議、他方更徵美日法各國之意見、英國此種行動、雖并不根據九國公約之規定、唯遵循此約之精神、則無待於説明、唯據英國駐紥中日兩國之使節報告、日本所欲中國接受之條件、尚不在淪中國爲其保護國、並且中日談判亦不至有何遠大結果、英國官塲復稱、英美法日四國接洽結果、對於國際貸欵中國之範圍與條件、尚無成議、總之、英國對於中國之困難極爲關切、而中國政府亦覺金融困難之解决、實不容再緩、（二日國民電）</p>
<h3>英使訪美國務院</h3>
<p>［華盛頓］今日駐美英大使林德賽與副國務總理費列浦會談約一小時之久、衆信必係討論遠東事務、事後新聞訪員詢諸費氏、據答、渠與英大使所討論者、包括英美兩國政府對相互有關數問題之交換意見、費氏並未説明何種問題、繼乃承認美國現正密切注視關於中日恊謀親善一舉之發展、據此間觀察家推料種種之可能、其一爲某某數國將恊同貸債與中國、以解其財政困難、俾中國不必與日本作新經濟聯盟、（一日路透電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］華盛頓官塲現正考慮若干政府聯合以經濟援助中國之可能性、代替最近所傳日本向中國建議之經濟援助、此訊係美聯社於英國駐美大使林特賽爵士與國務院次官斐列浦作長時間之會商後得悉、若干觀察者現信此項合作有可能性、或將包括日本及其他國政府云、可靠方面聲稱、美國之政策、贊成根據九國公約及一九二零年之國際銀行恊定、由中國集合力量援助中國、以代替一國之單獨助力、因恐該國單獨享受權利、違反門户開放之原則也、由英國大使與斐列浦會議後之情形觀之、英國爲建議援助中國之創議人、顯然因英國在中國有極大之經濟利益也、若干當局咸信美國政府對於此項建議、特殊表示同情、因其能减輕華人對於美國銀政策遺禍中國之質難也、觀察者表示、日本乘中國金融緊急之際、進行其政策、完成其遠東之門羅主義、換取日本在中國之特權、但另有一般人則稱、中國或將利用被廹親日之苦衷、威脅西方國家、要求美國變通購銀政策云、（一日國民電）</p>
<h3>根據九國約精神</h3>
<p>［倫敦］路透社之外交訪員謂英大使林德賽與美國國務院昨在美京之談話、關於以財政接濟中國之可能性者、乃一般動作之一部份、此動作爲何、即欲查明何種援助可給予中國、以解决其目前貨幣困難是也、中政府曾與英國等商榷此種局勢、而上海中外銀行家已有關於外債可能性之若干提議、英方對於現已提出之計畫能否實行、不無疑念、並覺如能提出合於實施之計畫、英國願見在國際基礎上以財政援助中國、英國曾將此種觀念通告美日法三國、因此三國乃四國銀行團之會員也、但未提出由銀行團本身作何舉動之問題、倫敦方面切實聲稱、現未有另提辦法以代替中日間刻所進行的直接經濟談判之問題、至於任何直接談判、此間實無新聞、英方感想以爲如能成就國際計畫、則日本之參加、當屬必要、英國與其他有關係國深知中國因白銀問題而遭遇之困難、但迄未考慮具體辦法、英國未曾有向美國交涉其白銀政策事、近在美京所舉行之討論、雖以九國公約之精神考慮全部問題、但並未特别言及九國公約、至於中日間直接作政治討論事、聞駐日與駐華之英使現皆經當局告以經過情形、（二日路透電）</p>
<h3>英美合作第一歩</h3>
<p>林特賽與斐列浦之會議、爲英美兩國對於此事或能合作之第一歩實質表示、如共同援助中國之議、一旦成熟、則尚須向九國公約其他簽約國接洽、但政府官員拒絶表示此事業已發動、抑仍在計劃中、</p>
<h3>日反對列强干預</h3>
<p>日本駐美大使齋藤宣稱、據渠所知日本並未以任何經濟力量援助中國、日本代表最近與中國官員會談之目的、在改善中日之一般關係、但猶未至簽訂特殊恊定之時期也、要求中國放棄對日經濟抵制、亦在談判之中云、其他消息靈通之日人則稱、日本將反對列强聯合干涉中日之復交、及不違反現行條約援助中國之任何日本助力、如西方國家建議之共同援助、不在搗亂中日之關係而有正大之理由、則日本亦將表示同情云、（一日國民電）</p>
<h3>日外務省之見解</h3>
<p>［東京］據由華盛頓來電、英國駐美大使林德賽訪問美國務院、關於英美兩國對華利害問題交換意見、美國方而盛傳中日提携之目的、在於中日政治經濟同盟、並欲出於阻止中日提携之態度、日外務省因英美方面懷疑中日提携問題、頗以爲遺憾、抱持如次見解、日政府深信中日維持親善關係、各國爲遠東和平切望之事、故殊難諒解列强懷疑中日親善工作、或阻止實行中日親善等説、中日提携工作、如廣田外相在議會言明、尚未言及具體事項、然以外交工作解决兩國懸案、並以中日外交爲對等外交之原則、既由中日兩國一致意見、而日本政府毫無此項提携工作、排斥英美及其他國在華利益等意圖、現聞英美有對華國際借欵之提議説、日本頗難諒解其用意、蓋四國借欵團現已成爲有名無實、而類似此種借欵團之新國際借欵、除攪亂中國以外、無其他意義、並誘致中國受國際共同管理、係極明瞭之事、外務省將來招致英美駐東京大使、正式説明對華方針亦未可知、（二日日聯電）</p>
<h3>廣田外相今夏擬來華説</h3>
<p>［東京］日本爲使中日關係之調整、及提携具體化更加緊密起見、廣田外相亦决於今夏親自來華、（二日電通電）</p>

<h3>最近兩件銀行行員竊鈔案之透視</h3>
<p>— 彦</p>
<p>近來銀行行員竊鈔侵佔事件。時有所聞。在先有中國通商銀行之徐健侯一案。最近又有中國農工銀行之華仲初·潘瑞麟·丁誠甫·朱明貴等共同舞弊案。而尤以後者更引起社會一般之注意。就兩案加以考察。竊鈔犯之原任職務。同爲檢點鈔劵。其作弊之動機則均不出財色兩字。迷於財。乃奔走投機賭博之門。惑於色。故不惜以千金買笑。而揮霍無度。結果則莫不虧負累累。以致無法彌補。乃出此下策。以一生名譽爲犧牲。其不智孰甚。可勝浩歎。然而細味兩案案情之經過。侵佔者固干法紀。而銀行方面未能防患於未然。亦一憾事也。</p>
<p>我國發行制度之異於各國者。爲領劵制度之流行。查領劵制度起於民四浙江興業銀行。首以取消發行權爲條件。向上海中國銀行簽訂領劵合同。至民十以後。錢莊同業。又以金融恐慌。銀根奇緊。繼起請求。洎乎近年。一般銀行錢莊無不以領劵爲主要之副業。及至今日。華商銀行之發行鈔票者已有十家。發行數額。遞增頗速。而發行數額之增加。實與領劵制度。亦有相當之關係也。何則。蓋自廢兩改元實現。小錢莊頓告淘汰。其屹然存在者。則惟領用暗記劵是賴。彼輩領劵。其凖備與一般不同。所繳爲十足現金。而保證凖備項下之四成。由銀行給以六厘乃至七厘半之週息。故領劵百萬。每年即有二三萬元之利益。即去各項開支。盈餘仍頗可觀。因之。領劵行莊。無不鋭意經營。以事推行。甚至以貼欵（每萬自六元至十餘元不等）爲引誘。以換取他行鈔票。此種變態發行。當然未能盡合於社會之所需。由是「回籠」奇速。鈔劵間之檢劵工作。乃日見繁忙。向例領劵行莊之出「回籠」。當面僅點大數。如以發行銀行而言。領劵行莊交來之他行鈔劵。如大數無誤。即送鈔票間檢點。如發現短少。即以標　記號及剪綫爲憑。向送鈔行莊請求照補。或竟代爲記帳。日後總結。對短少之原因何在。則不加追究。反之。若行莊因來出「回籠」而發生問樣短少情形。其非當塲剪開發現者。則一律加以否認。如此片面辦法。實予不肖者以侵佔之機會。及此風告熾。各領劵行莊均以當塲檢點爲要求。而若輩揮金如土者遂不擇手段。最近大規模之竊鈔侵佔。即肇端於此焉。</p>
<p>乃者。徐華等之竊鈔侵佔。已相繼破獲。聞者足戒。此風當可漸熄。然而吾人尚有不能已於言者。即在發行制度尚待整頓之今日。金融機關制度方面之缺點。當不止上述一端。如何及早補救。使制度日臻於健全。以防止未來意外侵佔舞弊之案。實今日銀錢兩業之當局所宜注意之問題也。總之。吾人所希望於金融界者。「知人善任」「改良制度」兩言耳。金融業者或不以爲河漢乎。</p>

<h3>巴本辭駐奥公使説</h3>
<p>維也納　德國駐奥公使巴本日前啟程返國、外間有渠已辭職之説、「日報」評論此事、謂「巴本辭職之説一旦證實、當係德國政府對於奥國賛成法國和平政策極端不滿、而以爲奥國閣員聘問英法兩國一舉、咎在巴本之故、由此可見德國極端主義者又佔優勢、而其對奥侵略政策、必將捲土重來矣」云云、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>意阿衝突的分析</h3>
<p>— （意大利通信）</p>
<p>意國南進政策之激進</p>
<p>地中海糾紛展至東非</p>
<p>意大利算是世界上一大國、但是他國內没有鐵鑛、没有煤炭、没有石油、没有棉花、也没有羊毛、總而言之、一切天然的物産、他都缺乏、其他各國如英·如法·均有相當豐富的鐵鑛和炭鑛、德國到如今還是有很大量煤炭出産區、所以意國在這時候、不得不向海外尋求自然資源、以補她國內的不足、可是沿地中海——歐洲各强國的榮養地——非洲、都被英法所分占、意國僅有利波里一塊不毛之地、歐洲戰後、委任英國統治的有九十八萬九千平方哩的面積、人口有九百三十三萬、委任法國統治的有二十五萬三千平方哩、人口有六百四十七萬、意大利則所得無幾、其後英國的外交措置、非常聰明、曾對意大利表示讓歩、一九二四年、把東非接近意屬索馬利蘭·久巴河·一帶地域、割與意國、一九二五年、又犧牲一點埃及的土地、將伊拉巴布地帶割給他、所以英意之間、是没有什麽裂痕、法國總不肯輕於退讓、并且在北非尚不時發生局部的不調和、惹起些小糾紛、到去年年底、德法關係十分險惡以後、法國怕意國繼續主張破棄凡爾賽和約、即間接帮助德國、所以决定聯合意國的外交方針、纔有今年一月七日的羅馬恊定、</p>
<p>在羅馬恊定成立之前一個月——一九三四年十二月五日——意屬索馬利蘭與阿比西尼亞交界地方、兩國軍隊、曾發生了一次武裝衝突、這一衝突、表面上是没有多大關係、雙方祇死了一百三千幾個士兵、還有若干帶傷的、特别是在非洲、并不算一件怎樣的大事、不過非洲現在僅有阿比西尼亞一個獨立國家、而他又與英法兩國的殖民地相密接、此次衝突的發生、由於英·阿·兩國劃界的共同調查委員會、進到意·阿·紛爭未决的地域、纔觸發了這次的事變、</p>
<p>在意大利政府方面的説法、起初是攻擊測量隊、决未越過阿國國境、而且也没有越過國境的道理、可是阿國守備軍都配備得有機關槍大砲、并對意軍加以惡意的嘲駡、又有一人舉手爲號、向意軍挑衅、意軍原來没有開戰的意圖、所以援軍開到、阿軍潰走後、意軍也并未追擊、於是意國對阿國提出要求、第一、要阿政府正式道歉、第二、要賠償損失、</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞方面的説法、則恰相反、他説、意國軍隊侵入阿境七十五哩、在阿境瓦爾阿爾地方盛陳裝甲汽車·大砲·飛機、更無故對阿軍攻擊、阿軍戰死者有一百五十名、採取攻勢的、不是阿軍而是意軍、而且意軍飛機向阿軍抛擲炸彈二枚、以爲信號、跟着就開放機關槍、坦克車就向着阿軍衝鋒、當時阿軍祗有最小限度的自衛、并未開放機關槍或大砲還擊、事後、阿國曾將此事提訴國聯、要求國聯的裁判、國聯如何處决這件事、現在還不甚明白、</p>
<p>意大利何以要向阿國拓展其勢力、就是爲他的物資缺乏、和貿易市塲、無論在地理上、歷史上、以及現在國際關係上、特别是在非洲、有發展餘地、而與意國有多少關係的、祗有阿比西尼亞一處了、</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞是非洲的山國、面積約三十五萬平方哩、人口約一千萬、在非洲也算人口稀薄的區域、他的鐵道、從吉布其到阿底斯·阿巴巴·共計四百八十七哩、爲法國資本所修築、（自羅馬恊定成立、要與意國共同辦理、）這是一塊全未開發的土地、是意大利生産物品輸出的絶好市塲、同時阿國的牧畜相當發達、可以供給羊毛、農業漸次向上、能够供給棉花、其他如獸皮·咖啡·蠟·奶油·象牙·等、都是意大利現時所最需要的、更有意國所缺的金屬類鑛物鐵·銅·砂金·煤炭·等等此刻縱然没有具體的發現、照當地地質情形推測、是很有希望的、何况一八八三年意國曾與阿國訂立過和親條約、阿國是意國的保護國、一八九六年意軍吃了一回敗仗、纔取消了保護權、現在意大利成了近代國家、所以想乘機復活其以往的歷史關係、不過阿民善戰、恐怕不肯隨便屈服、（一月三十一日於羅馬）</p>

<p>滙兌</p>
<p>英美倫敦外滙市塲、英鎊續有售出、致價暴落、英美滙兑開盤、價爲四元八角一分六二五、較昨美英滙兑收盤價格低一二五、旋因感受壓力、較作美英甫及四十分鐘時、滙價暴跌二分、而為四元七角九分六二五、十一時又跌六二五、而為四元七角九分、至此市况始形穩定、午時回漲三七五、至四元七角九分三七五、收盤再漲半分、而為四元七角九分八七五、</p>

<p>芝加哥小麥麥市因廠商需求較殷、且因西南氣候迄未轉佳、故市價穩定、</p>
<p>利物浦棉花棉市今日穩定、五月期收盤價爲六·八八、高起五磅音、</p>
<p>利物浦小麥麥市今晨價漲八七五、收盤時價爲四先令十一便士半、</p>

<p>概述新疆近年變亂之經過（四）</p>
<p>馬仲英二度入新、係在二十二年四月下旬及五月初間、馬部先後動員七千餘人、浩浩蕩蕩、聲勢較前尤壯、此時適當四一二政變後、新省府百端待理、加以纏變四起、哈密空虚、故馬得長驅入新、直窺哈密、於六月間次第攻陷木壘河·古城子（奇台）等處、并收繳孚遠槍械、揮兵西上、新省府邊防督辦盛世才於五月二十六日、親率大軍、向東迎擊、僅到三台、即知古·孚·等地之失陷、而馬弟仲傑、已進逼省垣、盛乃反守為攻、於六月七日、與馬主力取接觸於紫泥泉、砲火極烈、雙方死傷（約在二千左右、而纏軍和加尼牙孜、復率同麻木提等部、倒戈攻馬、擁護新政府、馬遂潰敗、此即所謂紫泥泉之役也、和麻纏部所以與馬背道而馳、據省方所傳、一因馬仲英狼子野心、意在佔據新疆地盤、與中華民國脱離關係、而和加尼牙孜志在改善政治、使各族民衆取得中國法律上之自由平等、二因馬仲英爲客籍之大野心家、所部均係烏合匪衆、不惜孤注一擲、茶毒各族人民、而和加尼牙孜係土著望族、所部無一非本地之人、漸不以馬之行動爲然遂有改變方鍼之意、又見新政府成立、委用滿楚克扎布爲師長、西里克班第艾林·寒達比雅·鄂羅勒扎布諾音泰·等為旅長、以示各族民衆平等參與軍政權、省方復向和等剴切解說、以新政府之倒金、與纏民初聯馬仲英希圖改革新政、原屬同聲一氣、今金倒已償夙願、此後自宜與新政府合作、在和等初起事時雖有十年戰爭之大言、然究無何等特殊目的、至此遂翻然與省軍合作、（金未下台時、和曾投誠省軍一次、柴泥泉合作後、在南疆聞又反覆一次、）盛遂任命和加尼牙孜爲南疆保衛司令、麻木提爲師長、令其開赴南疆、鎭壓各縣之纏變、</p>
<p>紫泥泉之役、馬部傷亡衆多、損失槍械一千餘支、狼奔豕突、率殘部由山道竄踞鄯善吐魯番、盛軍北後克復孚遠古城及木壘河、尚欲乘勝追擊、突聞省城將有所謂二次政變（四一二政變爲一次）之爆發、其活動之對象、則爲倒盛、盛遂放棄追擊、星夜班師回省、借開會爲由、邀請主謀分子陶明樾·李笑天·陳中三人、槍决於省府花園中、（此次因歸化軍團長巴平古台氏參加、為其部下別克跌也夫氏告密、巴亦被拘、別則現升任至南疆剿匪總指揮、）</p>
<p>先是二十二年春吐魯番事變、馬仲英嗾使馬石明佔據吐魯番及鄯善、其時南山首領馬全祿馬德祥各不相容、馬德祥將馬全祿解决、即投誠新省府、經盛世才委為師長、馬石明恨馬德祥之投誠、又將馬德祥解决、於是南山纏回各部均入馬石明之掌握、馬仲英二次入新、到達吐鄯、派其副師長馬黑鷹赴南山恊助馬石明、遂於七月間率所部四千餘人、由烏拉擺迤南·太平渠方面進犯省城、經盛軍分兩路出擊、馬部不支、遂潰竄南路托克遜一帶、馬仲英迭經潰敗、思得一休養整理時間、刀向盛請求投誠、盛亦有其他顧忌、遂委曲求全、任馬為東路警備司令、并指定哈密鎭西爲駐防區、所有薪餉服裝、新省府均願照章發給、馬一面派遣代表、晋省周旋、一面仍駐吐魯番、積極部署、於九月間密使馬黑鷹潛赴阿山鼓動回民、擾亂塔城、并進犯額敏·綏來·呼圖壁各縣、為西路一支、又令旅長馬某綽號黑漢者、率步兵數千、由達板城進據芨芨槽、爲南路一支、馬仲英本人、自率基本精銳騎兵一旅、由達板城至石窰子、偷越天山、猛攻孚遠、為東路一支、時伊黎屯墾使張培元、四一二政變後、雖經新省府薦請中央任命為省委·師長·兼邊防帮辦等職、然精神上究未與新省府真正合作、故馬亦曾與張打通關節、企圖各路進兵、齊向迪化作大包圍、矢志得迪以作掃蕩全疆之根據、</p>
<p>省府以警訊四傳、情勢危廹、乃先派遣勁旅（一説即阿山歸化軍）星夜援塔、及援軍抵塔、塔圍即解、馬部副師長馬黑鷹指揮李福興等、旋經由額敏·綏來·呼圖壁·一帶、向廸化竄擾、旋與盛軍接觸、激戰數晝夜、李福興先陣亡於呼圖壁、馬黑鷹後亦傷斃於雀兒溝、西路一支遂告失敗、南路一支、盛出主力軍先截斷其聯絡、嗣即大戰於達坂城、略得勝利、即廻師鞏固省防、馬微聞西南兩支之敗耗、并不餒怯、一面派人赴廸、續談和平辦法、一面復暗調勁旅、按原定計畫、猛襲孚遠、蓋廸化爲新省根本、古城爲省東重鎭、孚遠雖係小邑、惟介於迪古之間、在廸區戰局上、尤為東路一大關鍵、孚遠既下、則古城迎刃而解、省城根本自易着手矣、不期孚城過去雖曾被馬佔據一次、至此官民忽作極强烈之死守、馬圍攻共九天八夜、卒未攻破、（守城方法新頴、婦孺爲之努力、頗有一述價值、容另叙於後、）馬部犧牲極鉅、然彼猶再接再厲、以圖最後之掙扎、亦可謂頑强矣、</p>
<p>伊黎屯墾使張培元、對新政府設施、素懷不滿、近既得馬之聯絡、遂開始反對之行動、會盛派陳德立（今任新省財廳長兼外交署長）廣祿（錫伯族人、今任塔什干總領事、）趙師鵬（今任塔城行政長）等、採辦材枓、經過張防、全被截留、并以北疆總司令名義、聲討盛世才、於十二月初、派旅長楊振中梁志鴻、分頭出動塔城烏蘇、復合綏來而西進、以與馬仲英部聯絡、進窺迪化、盛軍當亦西開一部份、正遇戰於綏屬之烏拉烏蘇、相持未分勝負、楊等忽接張氏急電令即旋師、甫至安集海、（距伊六站）而張氏已自殺、蓋張除遣楊張等部出發外、僅留一千餘人、坐鎭伊黎、當有盛軍特編之阿爾泰塔城歸化軍約兩混成旅、兵精器鋭、由塔城行政長某為總指揮、乘張後防空虚、直搗伊黎、猛甘張部三晝夜、張見勢不支、遂自殺於城外六十里之某地、死後傳有遺囑、爲追軍所得（其文略謂「一誤於羅部長之蒞伊謂某方將以實力補助、再悮於楊振中出師太早、退兵太遲、敵砲久轟伊城、負疚良深、商民前貸餉欵、原以遺産償還、老母在堂、入棺請代穿孝衣」等語、但亦有謂張之死、實乃被殺、遺囑亦係僞造者、）歸化軍在伊黎大捷後、即駛車東進、所過烏蘇·沙灣·綏來·呼圖壁·昌吉五縣、因歸軍不諳地方情形、又以省防吃緊、急於赴援、不暇顧及一切、故沿途頗多騷擾、蓋其時遥與張培元互相呼應之南疆總司令馬仲英、又已號召萬餘之衆、圍攻廸化一月矣、</p>
<p>馬此次（最後一次）圍攻廸化、因恃北路馬黑鷹之騷動、四路張培元之響應、并得盛軍某部變兵（多係金樹仁嫡系舊部）先後加入、聲勢頗爲煊赫、但新疆大地廣漠、各路交通素感不便、對軍事影響極大、當馬初敗、已接洽投誠矣、而張發會銜討盛之通電、始悠然遲至、迨馬黑鷹之失敗、馬又不知也、張培元之自戕、馬更不知也、故獨大舉圍迪、歷時一月之久、城中民糧缺乏、危機日益嚴重、然盛軍究有恃無恐、將四週城防綫縮成二十餘里、以静制動、只防禦而不出擊、馬圍至匝月、於十二月十七日拂曉、竟由城南之南樑、一度攻入防綫、但旋即敗出、嗣聞援盛之阿爾泰歸化軍將來廸夾攻、馬即調集大部、迎堵於城西七十里之頭屯河、與歸軍作殊死戰、馬率殘部四五千人、狼狽逃竄、從此退往南疆、</p>
<p>阿爾泰歸化軍既解迪圍、一部欣然乘車北返、一部及救國軍宋旅、乘勝向馬部跟蹤追擊、沿途均有激戰、若遇大城險地、馬恒據守頑抗、在焉耆·吐魯番間之哈拉峽、峽長三十里、險峻天成、追軍用飛機投彈始下、而和加尼牙孜所部．受命截堵馬軍於庫車一帶、其武裝反被馬部所繳、馬因此軍威復振、嗣又連受打擊、退過阿克蘇·而至莎車、迫不得已、始將餘部兵柄全畀楊振中李海如、輕裝簡從、由喀什而走蘇聯、盛屢請引渡、未獲蘇聯允許、楊振中李海如等、於馬出走後、旋率殘部、退入玉和闐、楊李係金樹仁舊部、曾受盛之指揮、李於古城失守時降馬、楊於張培元失敗後、偕馬南退、馬得楊李助力極大、臨走曾有委託代理三十六師正副師長之說、二十三年年底、甘肅敦煌縣政府尚接到楊等反盛通電、是知塔里木大戈壁迤南各縣、新省府之政令尚未到達也、（未完）</p>

<h3>史高塔杯複賽重賽東華卒淘汰臘克斯</h3>
<p>３—２</p>
<p>奪得與法商决賽之權</p>
<p>雙方表演極精彩之至</p>
<p>逸園萬餘人手舞足蹈</p>
<p>東華臘克斯之史高塔杯複賽、自前週二比二和局後、昨日在逸園再度火併、東華卒以三與二之比淘汰臘克斯、獲得與法商之决賽權、昨日春光普照、氣候和煦、逸園座中、紅男綠女、不下萬人、無不手舞足蹈、得意洋洋、</p>
<p>東華隊個個賣力</p>
<p>東華養精蓄鋭已久、精神飽滿、軍容整肅、關洵安雖隨復旦北征未歸、陳洪光猶不及趕返、於實力方面、不受影響、更以馮運佑特别賣力、瞻前顧後、四方接應、奔馳不遑、五前鋒除萬象華稍差外、餘均努力奮鬥、發揮無餘、賈幼良之右翼、已至爐火純青之妙、送出不少妙球、予戴李不少機會、惟陸鍾恩之大意失事、致造成三比二之緊張局面、</p>
<p>臘克斯表演深刻</p>
<p>臘克斯俱屬少年勇將、人材一如東華、最近來每戰必捷、西捕亦甘拜下風、已公認爲西人中之唯一勁旅、自前週與東華戰成二比二平手後、雄心勃勃、希冀染指史高塔杯、故舊敵重逢、不免一番劇戰、果又先破東華之門、但卒以一球之差敗北、盧蒙斯、H麥達、鮑沙列及守門柯克倫之表演、可稱盡善盡美、予觀者以深刻之印象、</p>
<p>鮑沙列居然先進</p>
<p>兩隊攝影後、東華面東開球進攻、觀者極力聲援、球塲空氣、甚爲緊張、馮運佑踢任意球、逼入底綫、萬象華送出角球、陳家球頭頂攻門、被柯克倫巧接、東華猶猛攻不已、聲勢洶洶、臘克斯門前、險象不去、李義臣戴麟經幾次攻門、不得其當、過門不入、臘克斯渡過難關以後、驟如無覊之馬、一往直前、大興問罪之師、前鋒極行迅速、東華腹地、大爲緊急、鮑沙列神出鬼没、無孔不入、陸鍾恩救球失脚、小鮑趕上一踢中鵠、東華竟先告失守、</p>
<p>李義臣回敬一隻</p>
<p>東華既先告失利、觀者無不爲之一驚、即東華球員、亦如驚弓之鳥、幸而軍容嚴整、小心翼翼、賈幼良在邊界送出高球、戴麟經居中策應、攻門未進、馮運佑捲土重來、高球挑中、賈幼良頭上渡過、李義臣得其所哉、對門猛射、健立奇功、造成平手、四座復充滿欣喜之聲、空氣乃轉和緩、但競爭形勢、從此更見劇烈、</p>
<p>二對一東華佔先</p>
<p>兩隊聯絡均佳、行動亦均迅速、實爲難得之精彩比賽、臘克斯拚命進攻、三前鋒極爲努力、但兩翼稍弱、東華鑒於前車之失、乃深溝高壘、加意防犯、故臘克斯幾番進窺、一事無成、萬象華沿邊偷進、射門被接、馮運佑得球交賈幼良、在底角傳中、李義臣轉送與戴麟經、阿戴對準敵門、又建一功、於是反敗爲勝、上半時以二比一結束、</p>
<p>李義臣造三對一</p>
<p>休息後再戰、臘克斯一鼓作氣、擬以出奇制勝、但T麥達角球失利後、遂予東華以進攻之機會、戴麟經揮軍前進、賈幼筤　帶球深入門側、逼得太近、不能施展、十餘分鐘後、臘克斯行動略有失檢、東華不以爲意、鎭静作戰、賈幼良遞來一球、戴麟經虚張聲勢、李義臣一射中的、三比一、東華乃佔極優形勢、</p>
<p>臘克斯最後掙扎</p>
<p>臘克斯氣燄稍衰、東華風頭正健、似可高枕無憂、李義臣得幼良之球、冲天飛出、失去機會、臘克斯幾度進攻、均無門路而入、轉戰良久、雪蒙斯努力掙扎、圖造機會、鮑沙列躍躍欲試、幾次過門不入、後以阿陸之大意、卒被鮑又建一功、成三比二終塲、兩隊出塲人員如下、</p>

<h3>國際籃球第一戰中華敗於美國</h3>
<p>美國實力之强空前未見</p>
<p>中華依然故我奈何不得</p>
<p>結果五十七比三十一</p>
<p>本年上海國際籃球賽、女子因規則不能一致、遂告停辦、已屬掃興、而男子組祗中美兩國採三賽兩勝定勝負、中華復遠不敵美國、可謂掃興之至矣、籃球界之不景氣、良可慨歎、但比較言之、中華球藝、並不弱於往年、祗以美國隊之球藝、進歩良多、遂成懸殊之局面、昨晚中美第一次戰、中華以三十一比五十七失敗、上半時美國三十一分、中華僅八分耳、</p>
<p>海上最强陣綫</p>
<p>美國隊以西青史密入蘭茵及卡爾生三、斯加入麥令樂克與勃利士二員能將、如是强固陣綫、爲海上從來未見、擲籃之凖確、聯絡之美妙、與防守之嚴密、誠可嘆觀止矣、宜其中華隊一籌莫展、甘拜下風矣、</p>
<p>中華無可奈何</p>
<p>中華陣綫、比較言之以馮念華錢敬鏞任兩鋒、陸鍾恩孫寶慶爲後衛、徐亨任中鋒、較爲整齊、陳宗祺之內衛、可代孫寶慶、僅聯各方面、略見欠缺、錢敬鏞球藝、遠不如前、馮念華孫寶慶一如往昔、陸鍾恩威風猶不减、復端賴其指揮一切、</p>
<p>僅僅擲中一球</p>
<p>開始後美國以正式陣綫出塲、使中華毫無生路、奈何不得、四對零後、孫寶慶打中上半時僅有之一球、此後成十比二、賴罰球得三分、成十對五、直至二十六比五、其中美國復不時調人、中華除孫打中一球外、餘則罰得六分、上半時以八比三十一落後、</p>
<p>最後形勢平均</p>
<p>下半時起、美國陣綫大爲調動、正式人員僅存史密斯一人而已、陸鍾恩連中兩球後、聲勢一振、以後雙方互有進展、形勢遂成平衡、三十七比十七、四十一比二十三、此爲分數最接近時期、美國又大調人馬、仍以最初之五人上塲、惟形勢遠不如前之緊張、中華亦時有投中但最後中華仍負二十六分之多、比數三十一比五十七、裁判員張國勛與霍爾、第二次賽、已定六日下午八時仍在申園舉行、</p>

<h3>國際亞林匹克委員會通過今後三届會議地點</h3>
<p>請求各國勿現金奬賞選手</p>
<p>（哈瓦斯社一日瑙威京城電）國際亞林匹克委員會、頃議决以後三届會議、一九三六年在柏林舉行、三七年在華沙舉行、三八年則在埃及開羅城舉行、委員會因聞若干國家擬以現金奬賞選手之得勝者、本日特加討論、當經决定、要求各國亞林匹克委員會、勿將此事實行、則以選手一旦接受現欵、即失去業餘資格故也、關於一九四○年亞林匹克運動會地點問題、意大利代表確已在本日會議中、撤回在羅馬舉行之要求、惟問題形勢仍屬混沌、蓋多數未出席國家之代表、業已投票選舉、其中必有選舉意國者故也、國際亞林匹克委員會主席比國代表貝萊拉都、不願委員會之决議、被人認爲政治性質之折衷方案、乃提議延期至明年國際委員會在柏林開會時、再行决定一九四○年運動會之地點、全體委員除某國代表棄權以外、皆表贊成、此議卒歸通過、</p>
<h3>工商足球賽市土得旔組錦標</h3>
<p>組　隊之勝負　　　成績</p>

<p>建　市土勝建國　　二比一</p>
<p>建　華商勝亞細亞　一比零</p>
<p>中　南光和一心　　一比一</p>
<p>動組中保民順記兩隊、均屬勁旅環戰以來、均未敗挫、儼成對峙之局、昨日值賽、上半時、一對一平局、下半時、二對一保民勝一球、是後保民雖尚有一塲比賽、但以恒情度之、錦標地位、當不致有所變更、至據昨賽情形而論、順記後衛綫較硬、攻射機會亦較保民爲多、奈球神不佑、每每失之毫厘、竟以一球之差、而棄前功、惜哉、</p>
<p>建組市土歷戰迄今、四勝一和、建國則曾勝四次、昨日相遇、爭覇中原、上半時、一對一平手、下半時市土再獲一球、而建國則無所建樹、於是市土遂得以二對一之勝數、握有該組錦標、蓋市土於此爲末塲比賽、而其他各隊得分、均不如市土之多也、</p>
<p>生組頤中隊多數隊員、因職業關係、星期六及星期日、均不能抽身出席比賽、連續棄權、又覺有損精神、故具函向該會中請退出、嗣後該組中與頤中值賽者、不必到塲、</p>

<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>紗價雖跌賴有多頭撑住</p>
<p>外匯日見放長</p>
<p>洋花價格合算</p>
<p>本棉跌風難戢</p>
<p>紗市平疲、大勢情形仍屬軟弱、滙兑猛升、外紗價格歩跌、本紗當然受其壓廹、惟標紗有大户組織多頭公司、拉緊不放、且意態十分强硬、故目前狀况尚覺安静、然國際金銀潮流、如斯汹湧、與吾國物價、影響非淺、將後之變遷、恐難逆料、</p>
<p>金鷄静中帶軟</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月均呈下降之勢、蓋以海外棉市平澹、而金市大八角、市氣曾見一度虚慌、近月跌九角、遠跌七八角、但多頭公司吸進之貨、安然不動、拍至二三盤、檯面又轉緊昂、結果近跌二三四角、遠失七角、午後開盤平静、塲中買賣不暢、市情無甚變化、同時聞現紗銷路、尚堪維持、一般投機者、對於標紗暫抱觀望態度、因比較有財力者、把持做多、交易减縮、以待機遇而動、收盤時十分安定、各有微漲一角、查賣出達記九百包、錦昌七百五十包、均昶八百包、泰昌八百包、同和五百五十包、信誠一千三百五十包、愼記四百包、長豐四百包、同興四百包、明德四百包、買進大孚一千一百包、大豐四百包、新昌五百包、仁豐一千四百五十包、潤康二千包、生源八百包、永大八百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列左、</p>

<p>寗波　二五　　同行　三五　　長沙　四○</p>
<p>廣東　一六五　汕頭　三○　　蕪湖　一○</p>
<p>花市仍疲、且跌勢未戢、實以金價打破八百五十元大關、印美匯兑狂升、而美印棉市尚落、以致採算價無日不低廉、與吾國棉市比價日近、但有一部份獲利抵補、市盤略平、市上現棉廠需沉悶、棉市前途、未許樂觀、</p>
<p>鄭標跌風猶在</p>

<h3>你歡喜吃糖嗎？</h3>
<p>— 重樓</p>
<p>小朋友：你歡喜吃糖嗎？我知道，你一定是很歡喜的；因爲「香蕉糖」「午奶糖」「花生糖」……這些糖的味道都很好，吃到口裏覺得很甜蜜；但是你如果吃糖吃得多了，你的胃裏就要作酸，或者要發生牙齒痛的病象！</p>
<p>小朋友：你歡喜吃藥嗎？我知道，你一定不歡喜；因爲「萆蔴油」「鎂磺養」「金鷄那」……這些藥的味道都很苦，吃到口裏覺得很難受；但是你如果生了病，睡在床上不能動彈的時候，醫生給你吃了藥，却能治好你的病，使得你恢復了平常時候的康健。</p>
<p>所以我們不能因爲糖味甜，就説它好，因爲藥味苦，就説它不好，世界上不但糖和藥是這樣的，還有許多事情也是這樣的，譬如説：游戲是很高興，讀書是很麻煩，但是一個人如果祇知道游戲，不知道讀書，那麽他的學識没有造成，將來在社會上就不能立足，並且在社會上連一碗飯都没有吃了！反過來説：一個人如果肯用心讀書，不多事嬉戲，那麽他將來一定能造成很豐富的學問，給社會上貢獻一番偉大的事業。</p>
<p>小朋友：你聽了我的話，你是預備做一個努力讀書的孩子呢？還是預備做一個貪吃貪玩的孩子呢？</p>
<h3>希望小朋友也做發明家</h3>
<p>— 達齋</p>
<p>小朋友，見到這標題，或許要説自己讀書還少，年紀尚幼，怎麽對我抱這種希望，不是笑話嗎？但，不是笑話，真的，試看近來蘇俄的小朋友。</p>
<p>蘇俄教育發達，兒童也刻苦求學，所以兒童的發明品，竟達二千種之多，返觀我國小朋友，有没有什麽發明？但從來未曾聽見過。</p>
<p>瓦特幼時，見煮水遂發明蒸汽機關，福特幼時，因修錶遂發明汽車構造，利用兒童好奇心理，創造機械偉大的發明，由此可見兒童做發明家，在西國早已有之，不自今日始了。</p>
<p>發明家固然是不容易做，可是所發現的，都是在尋常人人習見習聞的事理上，隨處留心，考察得出來，不過他們是有鋭敏的眼光，精細的腦力，繼續的恒心，奮鬥的精神，纔能看得到，想得到，做得到，那末，他的目的，也纔能達得到，是埋頭苦幹的努力做出，不是粗心浮氣的僥倖成功，小朋友，要想做發明家，須知並没有什麽神秘，平時用力量去做，所謂「有爲者亦若是」，未嘗不可以做到的。</p>
<h3>國花</h3>
<p>— 前月</p>
<p>小朋友們，你們學校裏或客廳裏面，不是掛着許多國旗嗎？如英國，德國，美國，日本…等。但是你們可知道嗎？每個國家除了那旗的式樣做標幟外，還每個國家都有一朶花，呌做國花。現在我拿幾個我所知道的，寫在後面，餘多不知道的，請你們去問問你們的先生罷！</p>
<p>中國—梅花　英國—薔薇花</p>
<p>德意志—矢車菊花日本—櫻花</p>
<p>意大利—雛菊花　美利堅—山杞花</p>
<p>法蘭西—百合花　葡萄牙—雁來紅</p>

<h3>怎樣組織一個課外讀書會</h3>
<p>— 上海龍湖小學十三歳女生沈延英</p>
<p>課外讀書會，是帮助我們增進讀書興趣，和養成自修習慣。</p>
<p>讀課外的書本子，是大家所不同的。有的喜讀歷史故事，有的要看滑稽圖畫，還有的喜閲冒險小説。那末，興趣相同的，便可合在一起，成爲一組。（我們這學校裏六個人爲一組）</p>
<p>每一組裏讀的書，請先生設法去搜集。我們看完了，便聚在一起，大家講讀書的快樂情形。</p>
<p>我們的課外讀書會，有種種比賽。那一組看書看得多或快。每星期報告大會一次。由委員會審查。</p>
<p>諸位小朋友！你們也可起來組織一個課外讀書會，它還有幾點利益。</p>
<p>（一）書本可以互相交換（要愛惜，不弄壞。）</p>
<p>（二）不懂的地方，可以提出來大家討論。</p>
<p>（三）養成功自己讀書的能力。</p>
<p>（四）增進一切知識。</p>
<p>好了，大家起來組織吧！</p>
<h3>青娃爲甚麽要冬眠</h3>
<p>— 承昭</p>
<p>小朋友，我們要知道「青蛙爲甚麽要冬眠」？我們先要研究青蛙是屬於温血動物呢還是屬於冷血動物呢？</p>
<p>動物學告訴我們：「無論氣候酷暑或嚴寒，而動物的體温依然不變，名爲温血動物。否則便是冷血血動物了。」青蛙在夏天氣候温暖時，身上也是温暖；但一到冬季氣候寒冷時，那蛙的身子也變冷了。你想蛙不是冷血動物嗎？</p>
<p>因爲到了冬季嚴寒時蛙的身體變冷的緣故；所以那時它老是緊縮着四肢，什麽事也不能幹，就是吃食這類事也不能做啦！它祇會一味藏到地中去睡眠，這就是呌「冬眠」。</p>
<p>小朋友，我想你們一定要疑惑着問我：「那未蛙冬眠時不吃食物，不會餓死嗎」？是的。因爲青蛙在冬眠的時候，它不能够吃食物；所以它在温暖的夏季裏非多吃些食物不可。像螞蟻這冷血動物，一入了冬天氣候寒冷時，它們就躱藏在巢內不出來了。可是它們在夏季裏早預爲冬日積着糧呢？</p>
<h3>北美互助生活的動物</h3>
<p>— 珠明</p>
<p>北美洲河邊海狸，齒甚利，罷齩斷樹幹，取皮和枝爲食料，取幹作巢。常常集合同類的力量，利用它們很鋭利的牙齒，齩斷沿岸的樹根。樹根齩斷，樹就倒在河裏，他們將倒下來的樹，作爲堰壩；圍着河邊的水停蓄堰內，所有海狸，分部居住，好像成了一個村落。四周派有同類充警衛兵，常川駐守，設若碰到敵害來襲擊，大家都一齊上前抵抗。</p>
<p>落機山的大角羊，也是集合同族爲一羣。倘在出行休息路上，或採取食物的時候，它們必定輪流當警衛兵，以護衛全羣。</p>
<p>北美平原中的野牛，常常結隊出行，連貫而走，往往經兩三天纔能走完。所以有些農人工人，時常碰到它們，阻住不能前進。又如當他族來侵犯時，於是它們將老的幼的居在隊伍中央，壯的居在隊伍外面，共同恊力以抵抗敵人。設或遇到狼攫了羣牛中一牛，那麽那些——一羣未被攫的牛，就合力緊追，不奪還那牛，誓不干休的。</p>

<p>（三）不料，那不是襪帶，却是書本上繫着的一根帶子，於是肥兒自己反而被榮兒手上捧着的許多書本壓倒在地上。</p>
<h3>科學先生變戲法</h3>
<p>— 何公超</p>
<p>請鼻子做偵探</p>
<p>科學先生在開學後不久，又上台了。他拿了三個銅元對台下説：</p>
<p>「小朋友們，今天我變戲法，只用這三枚銅元；但是工具雖少，變起來却依舊是狠有趣味，很有意思的。由此我們可以知道：如果我們懂得種種科學常識，那末，就使是幾個銅元，幾張紙頭，也可以做試騐的工具，也可變出神奇的戲法來的。」</p>
<p>「今天這個戲法，要我的鼻子來幚忙了，來，來，來，小朋友！」他一面説，一面攤開手掌，把三個銅元放在掌心內，閉攏了眼睛，對着台前的一個孩子説：</p>
<p>「我不看着，隨便你拿掉那一個銅元，等一會，你把銅元交還給我，我會請鼻子先生偵探岀你拿去的是那一個銅元，一點也不錯的。—但是我的眼睛是始終閉着的。」</p>
<p>那孩子在他的手裏揮了一個义着兩面五色旗，比較來得薄的銅元。</p>
<p>科學先生説：「把它放在台邊，不要拿在手裏。」</p>
<p>他繼續閉着眼睛，把賸下來的兩個銅元，擊緊的揑在手掌裏，這樣過了二三分鐘，又對那小朋友説道：</p>
<p>「現在請你把你那一個銅元還給我。」</p>
<p>現在，他的手裏依舊有了三枚銅元了—他一個個放在鼻子上，好像請它嗅了一下，最後，便毫不遲疑的把那小朋友拿掉過的銅元，舉在手裏，給那孩子看，説道：</p>
<p>「一定是這一個，對不對？」</p>
<p>那孩子一看，果然是那個义着兩面五色旗比較來得薄的銅元。於是大家嘖嘖稱奇着。</p>
<p>「説出來是很簡單的。原來銅是一種金屬，金屬是很容易傳熱的東西，那賸下的兩個銅元放在我的手裏幾分鐘，我手上的熱傳給了它們，因此它們也都温熱了；但是這位小朋友拿去了的銅元。没有傳着熱，它是依舊很冷的。等到我把這三個銅元一一在鼻尖上觸過，因爲她們冷熱的不同，我就知道那一個銅元是曾經拿開過的。這不是很簡單很有趣的麽？同時我們可以得到一種常識，就是金屬是容易傳熱的東西。如果我們拿紙團或布條來試騐，這戲法就要失敗了，因爲這兩樣東西都是不容易傳熱的啊。」</p>

<h3>水手辛白德傳（八）</h3>
<p>— 心青</p>
<p>不多一會，他們已到船邊。我們眼應着他們像猴子般爬將上來，末後便到了我們的甲板上。</p>
<p>他們扯下帆來，把船拖到岸邊，我們却不敢舉起一隻手來來阻住他們。他們使我們上了岸，就離了我們，搭了我們的船，到他們自己的島上去了。</p>
<p>你們試瞧，他們所抛下我們的那個島，是人們所很懼怕的，爲了這原因，可以避免時，便没有船敢駛進去。</p>
<p>到得那些矮人們去後，我們一路前行，經過陸地，發見那邊有些草本和水果之類，但我們都以爲去死不遠了。末後見遠處有一座大屋子，於是我們便動身前去。</p>
<p>這是一個極大的所生，有一扇黑木的大門。很配得給一個國王做住宅的。</p>
<p>我們由大門中進去，一眼就看見一堆人骨，近邊又有幾個炙肉的鐵义，好像是廚子用來炙大肉片的。瞧了這些東西，使我們都害怕得抖顫起來。</p>
<p>我們正在這愁慘的境界中，那門忽地推開了，一個高大的黑漢走了進來。他像一棵高樹般高；他只有一隻眼睛，恰在頭額的中央，像燒着的煤那麽發着光；他的口很大，他的手又長又尖；他的耳又大又闊，好像是一頭大獸的耳模樣，而他的指甲又像是食肉獸的大爪一般。我們一見這可怕的景象，就倒地暈去，嚇得像死人般躺着。</p>
<p>後來我們醒過來了，見那黑人仍立在我們面前，他對我們瞧了一會，便向我們走來。他將雙手捧了我起來，撫摩着我的周身，但我除了皮和骨外没有甚麽，他就把我放下了。他同樣的將我朋友們捧起來逐一撫摩。</p>
<p>我們的頭領不像我們一行人那麽瘦，於是那黑人提了他起來，將一枝鐵义刺穿了他，放在火上炙着。炙好之後，我們的仇人就把他吃了，於是躺下來睡了過去。他終夜的熟睡，他的鼾聲很響，震動全屋。</p>
<p>你們可以斷定我們這夜没有一個能人睡了。天明時那人醒了，走將出去，留下我們在宫中。他出去後，我們便設法想殺死他。夜色來時，見我們仍是滿懷着性命之憂。</p>

<p>婦女園地</p>
<h3>寫於「三八」節之前</h3>
<p>— 兹九</p>
<p>和煦的春風，吹出了嫩綠的柳芽，温暖的陽光，照育着出土的蔓草，大地回春了！弱柳纎草，也得自由地長育，然而中華大地上的大多數婦女，却依過其舊式的生活！</p>
<p>一九○七年的大地回春之際，德國蔡特金女士，領導國際婦女，成立國際婦女大會，從事婦女解放運動與勞働運動，該會成立於初春的三月八日，此後爲紀念這有意義的舉動，並希望不斷地努力，達到最後目的，於是决定了此日爲「國際婦女節」。</p>
<p>所以婦女節，不是是太太奶奶小姐們，談談説説，跳跳舞，聚聚餐，等等有閒玩意兒的佳節，而是婦女們自己起來求解放謀幸福的紀念日。</p>
<p>此後年年此日，各國的婦女，都有熱烈的紀念大會，只是紀念的方式，因各國婦女所處地位的不同，紀念的方式，各異其旨趣。已經得到解放的，自然歡欣歌舞地在祝賀。尚未得到解放的，循着既往的掙扎史跡，計劃着未來的奮鬥策略。</p>
<p>中國婦女，因爲受着封建社會的荼毒，過着非人的生活，翻開一部中國文化史，知道中國過去的整個社會被儒教思想所支配，而儒家目光中的女子是怎樣，單從禮記的「婦人，從人者也，幼從父兄，嫁從夫，夫死從子，」這一簡單定義，就可明瞭。它明明將女子鑄定了屬從的地位，指定她没有獨立自尊的人　與行爲。此後宋儒提倡婦女守節，更使女子喪失了性的自由。至明末的「女子無才便是德」的諺語，完全想將女子當做一個不言不語的木偶而已。</p>
<p>時輪進輾，終於輾碎了中國一般頑固的思想，産生了「五四」時代的新文化運動。婦女解放運動，亦是當時新文化運動目標之一。</p>
<p>然而隨着革命潮流的緩和潛伏，復古風雲，又甚囂塵上了，重唱婦女守節，再醮婦驅逐…………。都是明證。我們不反對保存國粹，更不反對維持固有美德，然中國以往的蔑視婦女，這是事實，在這一九三五年的「三八」之前，從事於婦運的團體，應一致起來反對封建與盲目的復古。</p>
<p>同時帝國主義的鐵蹄，隨處在殘踏中國，中華婦女在這大地回春之際，應該張開雙眼，認淸他們的真面目。</p>
<h3>婦女問題講座</h3>
<p>— 君慧</p>
<p>第二講兩性問題的生物學的探討</p>
<p>第一節　生物學上兩性的優劣問題</p>
<p>我想，大凡研究婦女問題的人，最先必須正確的認識生物學上兩性的優劣問題。因爲我們的研究踏進第一歩的時候，便會碰到站在生物學的見地，主張男性優勝論以反對男女平等的論敵。假使我們對這個問題没有正確的理解，那就很容易去承認男性優勝論，把女性放在天定的劣等地位。</p>
<p>我們曉得，歷史上一切的支配者，都爲了永遠保持其支配地位，製造某種適合於牠的原理或定律來，使一般被支配者去相信牠，服從他！此種實例很多，古代希臘的貴族哲人拍拉圖，主張貴族神聖論，中世的英皇查理士一世提倡王權神授説，都屬此例。同樣的，在男性支配的社會裏也必定會産生出男性優越論，拿來作説明男子支配權的學理的眼據，更拿來作確固其支配地位的玄秘的符咒！這是一點也不希奇的。</p>
<p>所謂男性優勝論，無疑的是發生於所謂父系制度成立以後，直到現在數千年來，牠支配着一切人們的頭腦，無論男女貴賤，都把牠當作天經地義的定理。且不説過去，即使在現在提倡男女平等的「文明世紀」，一般頭腦不淸楚的知識婦女們，也還在承認這個定理，承認婦女自身的天定的劣根性。這無疑的是婦女解放運動的一大障害！</p>
<p>那麽，所謂男性優勝論的學理的根據是什麽，牠的論據，首先就是最原始的非科學的陰陽學説，例如拿了天，地，日，月，陰，陽，水，火等自然現象來象徵男性與女性。拿來證明男子優勝於女子的定理，易經有：「天尊地卑，乾坤定矣」！這可以説最典型的象徵的論據，但在今日，牠已經失去了存在的價值！其次，最主要的就是生物學的乃至生理學上的論據，據牠説來，一切生物都以男性爲主體，女性不過是牠的附屬物。特别在動物界如哺乳類及鳥類等，男性比較女性體大力强，身體各部分的組織也很複雜，外表也來得好看些，人類也是同樣，不論是野蠻人或文明人，女子普通比男子矮小，體力也弱，頭腦的重量還不及於男子，精神活動力亦較男子低劣，這樣，女子是天然的比男子劣弱。這就是所謂生物學上的男性優勝論。</p>
<p>男性優勝論者也和其他支配者的機械的現象論者同樣，祗以固定的眼光去觀察現象，而要使現象化石化，却不願以動的眼光去審察現象的原因與本質。一部分動物及人類的男性優勝，雖是實際的現象，而這現象必然有其所以然的歷史的原因！然而這原因的發見，是對於男性支配的最大威脅，爲什麽？因爲這樣就會失去男性支配的理論的根據！</p>
<p>近世的科學，尤其生物學及社會學的發達，終於闡明了人類乃至生物界兩性問題的本質。達爾文發見了生物的進化法則而打破了支配者的上帝製造亞當夏娃的鬼話；天文學者科伯尼克（Copernicus）發明地動説而打破從來的天動説，古代社會的著者摩爾根是發見母系制而説明了父系制的歷史的原因與本質，特别美國的社會學者兼生物學者列斯特。瓦德（Lesterwood）發明了生物界的女性中心説，給從來的男性優勝論者以致命的打擊！</p>
<p>照瓦氏的研究結果説來，生物本來以女性爲主體的，男性不過是牠的附屬物，女性是生物的根源，在生物的進化過程中，爲着使生物更高級的發達，從女性派生出男性這個東西來，使牠盡異質混和的交精任務。在人類及高等動物中的一部分，好象有男性優勝的現象，但這自有其特殊的原因存在，在人類社會，一般的流行男性中心説，那是淺薄的觀察，固陋的傳説，習慣，先入爲主等所作成的結果。</p>
<p>在這兒，我們看到了兩性問題的完全相反的兩種學説。即男性中心説和女性中心説。但瓦特的話，是有科學的根據，我們還得相信他，他自己説：『我的這個研究，好像科伯尼克的地動説和達爾文的進化論排除了許多的非難，打破了當時的傳説那樣，不久也會一掃男性中心説的』</p>

<p>在舊時的封建社會裏，婦女的一切都是不自由的，　　　　的自由，事　　自由，職業的自由，性的自由，以及種種活動的自由。婦女的勞力是被人剝削的，性是被人佔有的；她們所處的地位是附属的地位，奴役的地位。</p>
<p>資本主義興起，叫出了平等和自由的口號，倡起了婦女解放運動，改革了封建時代男女間的地位的不平衡。那麽，資本主義社會中的婦女，究竟是過着一種怎麽樣的生活呢，她們是怎麽樣去享受，自由和平等的權利呢？現在讓我們先來看一看美國的婦女吧。</p>
<p>現在美國是一個資本主義最發達的國家，美國的婦女在許多國家中也是比較得着自由的婦女；所謂「婦女爲首」（Ladics　Fir.t）的這個擁護女權的口號，最能實踐的也是美國。照這樣看來，美國的婦女是完全解放，完全平等和自由了！</p>
<p>原來，一般上層婦女，當她們談到自由和男女平等的事體來，她們總認爲自由就是享受和男性平等的財産權和公民權。她們把自由看成是追求事業，從事創造的工作，以及從事任何職業與事業都不受性的阻碍。像這樣的自由，在資本主義的國家裏，特權階級的婦女大半是已經得着了。法律上的障碍和缺點，在美國也大半删改了。許多高等教育的創設和職業上的位置也向女性開放了。</p>
<p>並且，在特權者的集團中，主婦可以去僱用僕人操理家務，有孩子的可以僱聘褓姆！或者出錢把孩子寄放在私人幼稚園裏。這樣，一個結了婚的婦女可以很舒服地和單身婦女一樣地去從事各種事業，可以在職業和事業的領域中佔據主要的地位。</p>
<p>但是，在資本主義的國家裏，除開了這些特權階級，有着特殊勢力的婦女，得着了，些特殊的自由的生活外，一般中層以下的，完全靠着智力和體力勞働的婦女是怎麽樣的呢？</p>
<p>我們可以看一看在美國的許多智識和體力勞動婦女的一般生活狀况：</p>
<p>在學校裏的教員，在學校中充當教員的事業，在美國的近數十年來幾乎大半是婦女的事業。在過去五十年中學校裏的男教員人數已經漸漸减少。一九三○的調查，美國的一，○三七，○○○個教員的職業，中間有八五三，九六七，乃至於超過百分之八十的人數是婦女。在近十年中，美國女教員的人數增加了二○○，○○○之多，一切的公立學校中女教員的人數超過了全數的四分之三。但是一般學校中對於女教員的報酬比男的少，而所做的事體相等，這是决定了的辦法。</p>
<p>機關裏的職員，過去的十年在美國各機關的女職員人數有五十萬，到了最近已增加到一，九八六，八三○。差不多有半數的職員都是婦女。</p>
<p>在經濟危機開始以前美國機關職員的薪水是比較高的。一九二六年起，便開始减少女職員的薪水了。女書記的薪水平均每星期比男的减少十四元六角六分。女簿記比男的减少了十元八角七分。危機發生的當中，便一般地减薪了星期少了十元至二十元。但是男職員的薪金在當時還差不多兩倍於女的。</p>
<p>旅館和酒樓的侍者為了婦女的特殊工作能力，旅館和酒樓的侍者也大半是用女的。在美國一切酒樓和旅館中女廚役的總數是九四，二五二。女侍者二○九，五九三。其他的女役一○九，一二四。從一九○○年至一九三○年這三十年間逐漸增加成這樣的數目。至於她們的薪金呢，也是近年來逐漸的减少。比仿芝加哥的黑石飯店，從前對於廚役的薪金每星期十二元，有的飯店十五元。但在經濟危機以後，一九三○年春天竟有减至三十元一月的，而男的比較高。</p>
<p>現在，我們更進一歩地看在資本主義社會中，與資本主義的生産發生直接關係的機器工廠中的勞働婦女：</p>
<p>資本主義愈發達，機器愈進歩，熟練工人愈受排擠，而没有專門技術的婦女與兒童愈被吸收到工廠裏面。</p>
<p>在一八一七年以前就有一位大思想家説過：「婦女與兒童是掌握機器的資本家要尋覓的第一件東西」。到一八四八這位大思想家和他的朋友也已經看出資本主義是會吸收大批婦女到生産過程中去的。因爲機器生産，並不盡需要重力的工作，資本家更需要的是用婦女去參加輕工業廠裏的工作，而付低廉的工價。</p>
<p>現在再看美國的女工，美國一般工廠中女工的數目是超過男工的，無論是紗廠棉廠和許多輕工業的工廠。比方在烟廠中女工的數目就超過男的七四，○○○之多。在近十年中還開除了一共有五○，○○○個工人。原因是女工多了，生産率快，所以不需要那麽多的工人。</p>
<p>記得美國有一個做工廠調查事業的人向一個工廠的經理説：「你們爲什麽喜歡招僱女工來代替男工」？他的答覆是：「輕工廠裏的工作，女工做起來是比男的又快又好」。資本家利用婦女的作事能任勞，有耐心，没有專門技術，容易受支配，在機器房裏可以成天坐着，不斷地工作，不斷地生產。而成績比男工好，因此，男工被排擠了。</p>
<p>至於工資，女工的工資一般地都比男工少。這在美國的許多大工廠都是如此。在一九三三年的時候，有許多廠裏用一塊四毛錢一天僱用一個女工，而從前付與男工的是五塊錢一天。大概女工的工資和男工比起來，是百分之二十至七十的比例。</p>
<p>在資本主資的社會裏，體力勞動婦女，除開了勞力受着度外的剝削外，由於工廠中長時間的工作，夜工；等等妨碍衛生和身體發育的工廠制度，往往使得，個童年的女工不得依照她自然生理去發育；而成年的婦女，多半是未老先衰。</p>
<p>資本主義也定出關於工作時期的規定，保護勞工的工廠法，叫出保護兒童與婦女的口號，但這只是規定，而這種規定還是站在廠主方面，勞動者是得不着利益的。</p>
<p>統觀上面一切的婦女生活，在資本主義社會中，婦女是怎麽樣去生活的！資本主義所招示的自由，解放，男女平等的口號，在婦女身上是怎麽使用的！</p>
<p>婦女在社會上去服務，在廠內參力生產，在勞力的代價上不得和男人平等，回到家裏來，自然也因了男人的經濟地位佔優勢，男女間無形的有了主屬之分。在兩性的關係上，爲了資本主義社會中的商品化，婦女也變成了商品，被據有經濟優勢的男性所佔有，性生活變成了賣淫。</p>
<p>在美國，雖然強調出「婦女爲自」的口號，但這口號也只是一種外衣，實質上由於經濟的支配，爲首的還是男人，是丈夫；也和資本主義社會中其他的自由和平等的外形的表現一樣。</p>
<p>根據上面的一些狀况，在資本主義的社會裏，鄉女在職業上是獲得了廣大的機會；乃至於許多學校，機關，和其他服務的地方婦女的人數超過男職員。但是在婦女勞力的代價上看呢，做着同樣工作的男女職員，而女職員的薪水比男的少。正因為婦女勞力的代價低廉，各學校，機關，旅館，醫院，以及許多需要工作人員的地方都愛僱聘女的。因此，在資本主義的社會裏，職業婦女雖多，而就在職業這一點上，婦女的地位是較低的，男女是不平等的。</p>
<h3>佛學院的生活</h3>
<p>— 茜</p>
<p>幾年前，我在長江流域某一名鎮上飄泊時，曾偶爾結識了幾位睇破紅塵出家學佛的女居士。她們住的地方名叫佛學院。這佛學院正適合出家人理想的地域，是建在一個山坡旁的徲僻而幽静的地方。進門不遠，是兩塊大菜地，走過菜地間的一條一丈來長的鋪石道，就是講經堂，亦名教室，再往裏走過一條七八尺長的廻廊。便是大殿——禮佛的地方——大殿兩旁，毘連着一排一分爲兩的前後套房式的中國平房，方是女居士們的臥室和自修空。</p>
<p>佛學院的女居士並不多，一共只有七八個人，聽説她們是由隔江的居士林分過來的。這七八位女居士，俱是二十上下的年紀，而且都受過相當的教育，有的還曾做過教員。可是假使你只一眼望見她們那光秃秃的腦天，由頭頸套至脚踝的寛大的灰布袈裟，白布襪，元寶頭的尼姑鞋，以及手腕上套的那串唸珠，你對她總不會起什麽好的印象罷。要不是我曾同她們一路生活過幾天，我决想像不到那種道貌岸然非俗人的裏面，也有一顆和我同樣生趣盎然的心，而她們的情感之盛，實遠超乎俗人以上。</p>
<p>她們的日課，每日規定的上大殿禮佛三次，笑一次是清晨四時半，第二次中午十二時，第三次下午六時。朦朧的晨光裏和幽暗暗的薄幕中，在那大殿的「青燈古佛」前，女居士們的咿咿啞啞嫋嫋不絶的唸佛聲，雜在間或一響的大鼓聲和不斷的剝呀剝的木魚聲之中，像是在哀懇，又像在悲訴。平日有法師或居士——大都男性——來講經時，她們每日上午下午也上幾次課，課本當然不外大乘起信論，華嚴經，金剛經之類的東西。開起講來，講台上，法師或居士的眼睛死釘住講桌上的經本，講台下，女居士們的眼睛則死釘住各人書桌上的經本，講者埋頭自講，而聽者埋頭自聽，那種授課場面，第三者的俗眼看來，頗堪發噱。</p>
<p>這種講經的盛事，並非每月有的，而也不是專在這一佛學院舉行，有時是在幾百里遠的旁的城鎭中舉行，這種時候，女居士們也像行脚僧似的，脚下踏着芒鞋，奔波着前去聽講。至於平常在佛學院的生活，除了一日三次上大殿禮佛，以及有時上教室聽講以外，便各人在自己房裏抄寫或誦讀經傳，傍晚自大殿禮過佛轉來，各人去打各人的坐，參各人的禪。雖然在這二十世紀頗文明的城鎭裏，電燈却與她們無緣，曹雪芹的詩句，仍可爲她們寫照：「可憐繡户侯門女，獨臥青燈古佛旁」。其餘空閒的時間，她們便來裁縫洗濯自己的衣服鞋襪，或去各想各的心事。</p>
<p>在這種出家人的地方，私有財産制仍未消滅，而還可説，對於它的存在很是鼓勵的，女居士們在管理先生（一位帶髮出家的四十餘歳的刁滑女人）眼中址位的高低，與她們自己的私有財産成正比。佛學院有供給女居士們衣和食的義務，但女居士們有爲院的施主打醮唪經的義務。有時闊老們死了，他們的闊少或太太們想别政一點，便將這些女居士請去，在內圍裏，五更半夜唪起經來，銀鈴似的聲音響徹內外，這好像是對於死者的最後的風流奉仕。有時顯官達貴或名流富豪的顯考或顯妣仙遊或仙逝了，院長大人一道命令下來，女居士們便被管理先生解到死者的靈堂前，日復一日誦着超度死者亡靈的經傳，有時竟一連要誦七七四十九天。女居士們嗓子已嗄時，院長大人的腰包也已漲滿了——還不談平日藉她們的名義在外募捐化緣的人數目。這種生活，想女居士們在落髮時，做夢也不曾想到罷！</p>
<p>我詳細地知道四位女居士所以出家的原委。有三位是在俗家裏非常親密的小姊妹，因大家都是婚姻不如意，所以在大姐的婚期逼近時，三個人悄悄逃到鄰鎭的一個菴裏落了髮。第四位頗有錢的居士，是因爲富豪的未婚夫在未討她這位正配以前，已先有了兩位姨太太，因而負氣出家的。現在女子在婚姻上，雖不像以往那麽不自由，但在這貞女，孝女，烈婦，節婦層出不窮，世風日古的年頭，我想不久在婚姻上不滿意，或受虐待的已婚女子，也有人會採取這種慢性的自殺手段，藉以沽名釣譽的罷。那麽，我幾年前的舊相識，某名鎭的冷冷落落的佛學院，不久也會「生意興隆通四海」罷？</p>
<h3>保定的婦女</h3>
<p>— 子岡</p>
<p>打開河北省地面，我們找得到成爲三角形的三重鎭：北平，天津，和保定。</p>
<p>以前叫保定府，現在却改爲淸苑縣了。曾有一個時期這兒成爲軍事要地，也比較興隆過一陣子。但保定的最繁榮的時期，莫過於曹錕住在那裏的時期，因爲有要人們來往，大規模的旅舍也出現過—兩個，之後隨着便消聲匿跡了。</p>
<p>雖然是曾有過一個煊赫的歷史的保定，但婦女在這裏並没有經過很大的伸展。</p>
<p>這裏的婦女還保存着鄉間的質樸的特色，在保定城裏這味兒已够濃厚，但一到保定四鄉，便更可以證實了。一切的時髦玩藝兒在這裏是找不到的，一般人們所注意的新婦女也不過是中學堂裏的女學生而已。她們全是縞衣玄裙，在假日到大街上買一點學用品或日用品，這便是她們和校外接觸的最多的機會。由於女學生們的持重樸實的風氣，人們也取着一種無傷的態度對付她們，報紙上是很少有以女學生尋開心找題材的，這情形我們很不易在別的城市找到。</p>
<p>至於戀愛，在保定的學生界簡直是很希罕的一件事，因為一則男女分校，二則學生們來自鄉間的多，在早婚制度之下，來到中學的學生們早已男已有婦，女已有夫了。由此，她們的私生活是安定的。女學生的最高學府是保定女師和女子職業二學校，她們的出路是當小學教員或到外縣求學作事。</p>
<p>一般的城市婦女還算勤儉，除了少數在治家之外，貪戀着麻雀牌或黑飯，經濟獨立是談不到，大多還離不了男子的供養，她們閑來靠縫綴賺一點私房錢，因爲保定有幾個襪廠，因此繚襪頭襪口成了女人們的一般職業。這是由廠裏領來在家裏做，用不着上工廠的。</p>
<p>四鄉的鄉間婦女倒比較能自食其力，她們與男子一般無無地有着粗壯的膀子和大大的力氣，能在自晨曦在傍晚的田作之外再躱在屋中紡綫織布，然而近年因爲甲簡陋的木機紡出來的紗綫去織布反倒要賠本，拙慢的土據終於敵不過外來貨的傾銷，大半婦女已放棄這擋職業，却用洋綫織布了。</p>
<p>在四鄉最顯著的莫過於童養媳制度，這風氣普遍極了，近兩年更甚。因爲越窮，便想把「早晚是人家人」的幼女送出去當童養媳，省了食糧，那一面也爲窮，而同時雇不起長工或買牲口，便盼望早早收養童養媳來帮忙，像牲口一樣使喚。不例外，童養媳的生活是永遠見不到天日的，初到婆家只有半個目的新鮮——就是説，只有半個月大家把她當新人看待，先不開始午馬生活，一過這期限便不客氣了，新人早已在牛棚裏田壟上忙着了。除了勞作之外還要挨無理的毒打，所謂一代還一代，當婆婆的總忘不了她自己當媳婦時所吃的痛苦，自己做了婆婆非還本加利息不可，這全是知識閉塞的原故。也爲這，童養媳非常希望生兒子以及娶兒媳，因爲跟了這些階段，自己的痛苦也可以漸漸减輕了。</p>
<p>這是保定婦女的縮影，無論是在城市或在鄉村，都還是黑暗面多，推究一下原因吧。</p>

<h3>美的標準</h3>
<p>— 王以明</p>
<p>在一般絶對論者看來，美的東西，無論在什麽時代，什麽社會，什麽人羣中，都是美的。他們説，楊貴妃就在現代也是不容否認的美人，所以美的標凖是絶對的。然而，問題却不是這樣的簡單，事實上，封建時代的美人的特點，是「三寸金蓮」，「楊柳腰」，近代的「標凖美人」呢，則是裸露着胸膛，突出着乳峯，以一雙天足來支持擺動的全身，所以，就是「三寸金蓮」「楊柳腰」的楊貴妃在目前的上海，我想除了為人當作古董來玩味外，也是不會有人將她認爲絶對的「標準美人」的。同時，各社會各人羣的美的觀點也彼此不同：在我們看來，印度女人的裝飾是最不好看的，她們穿着燈籠式的褲子，包着頭，有的甚至在鼻子上鉗着金屬一類的東西，真是難看極了，但印度人却認為這是非常美好！美洲黑人我們説他是太黑了，不好看，但他們却是惟恐其不黑，常常在臉上塗着黑的東西，使之黑得發光發亮，以顯示其美麗！再說，如果把一張舊式的美人畫像與一幅現代的裸體畫放在一起，然後再叫一位頭髮梳得光光的青年美術家與一個鄉村的農夫來評價，那我敢說他們所得的結論絶難相同。——所有這些，都充分説明了，謂時代各社會各人羣的美的觀點是並非絶對同一的。在這意義上，我們可以説美的標準是相對的，不是絶對的。</p>
<p>然而，在另一方面，各種人羣的美的觀點雖不相同，但同一人羣的美的觀點却是相同的：在同一時代社會中雖有種種不同的美的觀點存在，即各種人羣的美的觀點存在，但在這中間必然有一種美的觀點佔着支配地位，這種佔支配地位的美的觀點便是那時代社會的美的標凖。在封建時代中，輝煌的建築，偉大崇高的神像，以至於帝王所穿的黄袍，雖是封建貴族的好尚，但這好尚却支配了他們的時代，因而那些東西便成爲了這時代社會所公認的美物。同樣，高大的四面光滑的洋房，雖是財主們的建築，但同時也是現代人所認爲美好的建築藝術，因爲這種美的傾向是支配着這個時代的。所以，超時代超社會的美的標凖雖不能成立，但在同一時代社會中却是有着一定的美的標凖。在此意義上，我們又可以説美的標凖也有其絶對的意義，並不是絶對相對的；以爲美的標凖是絶對相對的那種見解，也是絶對主義者的另一錯誤表現。</p>
<p>如果從根本上說來，那人類的美的觀念並不是來自天賦，而是在其社會生活中形成的。各時代各社會各人羣的人的美的觀念之所以不同者，乃是因為他們的生活的不同，並不是他們生來就具有不同的美的觀念的。為什麽封建貴族以輝煌的建築，崇高偉大的神像為美呢？那是因為這些東西使人一見就易發生莊嚴可敬之感；在保持自己的權威上，對於他們是很有利益的。為什麽農民喜歡健康的美人而不高興「羽不經風」的美女呢？那也是因為他們要勞作，要健康的美人對於他們的生活才有帮助，才無累贅。如果問題移到目前都市的一般仕女的裝飾上來，那便更加明白了。你知道，現代都市的裝飾變化得多麽迅速，幾乎是每年每月都有新的裝飾出現。你今年做一件最摩登的衣服，説不一定明年就成爲「舊式的」了。一九三五年還未過完，但中外成衣舖，各汽車行，各百貨公司，都拿出了一九三六年式的新樣式，新招牌。前兩年的摩登姑娘愛穿長絲襪，但後來又穿起短襪子來，到了現在甚至是不穿襪子，乾脆地顯示肉體美了。在大衣方面，前兩年是短大衣盛行，但近來的所謂新式樣子的大衣却是長拖拖的，而且還在後面開了鳻子。……這是什麽道理呢？我的回答是：現代的都市生活極不安定，隨時都在變動中，那般厭倦了物質生活的人，那般在這變動的生活中找不到出路而感到苦悶的人，都在日益探求新的奇蹟，新的刺激，這情形在藝術上表現出來的，便是那些所謂新傾向的什麽踏踏主義，立體主義，野獸主義，新感覺主義之忽來忽去地出現；同時，日新月異的新的裝飾式樣的來往，也就是此種情形的反映。所以，最後説來，美的標凖是爲人間的生活形態所規定的；所謂美的標凖之相對性與絶對性，都只有在人間的生活中才能找到實際的依據。</p>
<p>當然，這樣説，並不是在說凡是對於人類的生活有用的便可稱之為美，不，這乃是實用主義者的錯誤之見。事實上，煤油對於我們是有用的，但却並不美；大糞對於鄉村的農民也是有用的，但他們也未認之為美；……因此，我們只能説一切美的觀念都是人類實生活的産物，一切美的標準都是人類生活所規定的，却不能説凡是對人類生活有用的都可稱之爲美：也許我們可以説一切美的東西都是實用的，但却不能因之更説凡實用的都是美的。</p>

<h3>意志論</h3>
<p>— 曼倩</p>
<p>意志（Will），所以表示一個人的力量。</p>
<p>事到臨頭，看你是不是會屈服，是不是會「半途而廢」，當全視你的意志是否堅強為斷。有好多機會，很可以使你的前途有很大的希望的，但遲疑遷延，毫無决心，那些機會、終於冉冉地遠走了。我也見過好多青年，因不能戰勝環境，終於墮落在環境的巨力下，這就是没有堅强意志的左證。</p>
<p>由意志，才生决斷。不過意志力要能得正確的决斷，必須通過理智的網，能極理智的運用意志力，才有極正碓的决斷。</p>
<p>「固執」和堅强的意志，是兩種絕對不同的東西；固執也許是一種偏於情感性的成見，而且往往只是一種「先入之見」，對於一個人的事業的成就上是一個內奸，敗事有餘，而成事不足！</p>
<p>堅強意志的最高境界是：威武不能屈，貧賤不能移的。譬如一個主人為要殘害他的敵人去找到他的僕人，主人對於他僕人行兇的條件，是高位，多金，和美麗的婢女，僕人在這樣一個嚴重的命令和蠱惑的誘力之下，他應怎樣對付這個當前的難題呢？這就需要請出他固有的「意志」來，看意志力得最後勝利，還是物質的誘力得最後勝利呢？</p>
<p>那麽，怎樣運用意志力呢？我説：一，須具有百折不撓的精神，二，須自信，三，沈毅。茲分述如下：</p>
<p>一，須具有百折不撓的精神。如果已經自己審慎後决定的意志，務須赴全力以促成之。「頭可斷，志不可屈」；「成敗利鈍，在所不計」。要知任何事業，决沒有無阻力的；而真正成功的事業，是必先排除阻力，或化阻力而為助力的。督戰者見強敵當前，苟不振奮軍心，其不陷於身敗名裂者幾希；必先置之死地，而後三軍將士才能抱破釜沈舟，有進無退的决心；故意志一物，須堅持不替。</p>
<p>二，自信。對於自己已定的歩驟，决無反顧的餘裕，有才幹的人，意志心强，自信力也必強。</p>
<p>哥侖布堅信地圓之説，人家都認爲他荒誕愚妄</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>，然他爲自信力的驅使，美洲大陸，終於爲這個意志堅强，不爲習俗的諷刺而有所改變。</p>
<p>三，沈毅。人不能無感情，但感情的運用决不能超越一定限度之上。否則猶如無覊之馬，奔馳靡止，無從駕馭。故處事之先，必先出以極理智爲態度，從容分析，决不任使感情作一時的衝動。你不能任感情的衝動破壞你的前途，你需要養成「沈毅」「克制」的態度。</p>
<p>各業調查</p>
<h3>絲業</h3>
<p>— 逸安</p>
<p>根據歷年江海關的對外貿易報告，絲茶兩項在出口貿易上，總是居於首席的地位；可是，從一九二八年以來，茶業在不斷的虧蝕聲中雖還可勉強維持，但絲業的黃金時代却是已經成了歷史上的陳跡！</p>
<p>當這絲業一息僅存的現在，我們來談談上海絲業的組織情形，總該不是沒有意義的吧？</p>
<p>在上海方面能合於近代化的機械繅絲的絲廠共有一百十六家之多；大部份都是在閘北和南市一帶，在租界裏的還不到百分之二十。在一九二八年以前，那時正是絲業的黄金時代；我們祇要剛踏上閘北的大統路的邊緣，就可聽到轟雷似的機聲震動耳鼓，每個高聳的烟囪，噴着濃霧似的烟波，瀰漫了整個閘北的空際。從這機聲軋軋和烟霧瀰漫的交織的情景中．誰都以為絲業的前途正是舖滿了黄金的大道；可是，眼前的事實告訴了我們，現在的絲業，已經是到了最後一刹那的迴北返照的環境，以後所能給我們看到的是祗有更多的絲廠門上貼着法院的封條。</p>
<p>過去握有這一百十六家絲廠的龐大資本勢力的，大概是無錫帮。蘇州帮和湖　　佔絶對多　，已故的鉅商胡雪崖及薛潤生兩人，更是絲業界中的巨擘。這些過去曾在絲業界中煊赫一時的每個絲廠的主人翁，有的是已經亡故，有的是經不起瘋狂的經濟不景氣的打擊，因之消失了繼續經營的勇氣，於是，上海的絲廠便像黎明時的晨星般的一顆顆地消滅了。現在所能勉強掙扎開工的絲廠，僅祗有不到二十家的數字；而且這二十家還不到的絲廠雖然是在開車工作，也無異於駭浪中的帆船，隨時都有淹覆的危險。</p>
<p>談到絲業慘敗的原因，有許多人都歸咎到牠們本身的組織散漫，缺乏科學管理的方法，及機械陳舊以至於生産效率的低能等等問題；其實，只要是個熟悉絲廠內幕的人，就會深切的了解這些還是次要的問題。因爲一般絲廠的組織情形，比别的工廠並没有多大的差異，有之，也不過因爲生産方法的不同，稍微與别種工廠有點出入罷了。</p>
<p>一般絲廠的大概組織情況，也和普通紗廠一樣，在工廠之上設有一個管理處，總管全廠事項及一切對外的大權。管理處的內部大致又分為總務，業務，出納，棧房四部。工廠裏有廠長，工程師，工頭；廠方一切的事務都由廠長直接對管理處負責，同時廠裏的男女工人又都聽受廠長的節製。</p>
<p>在這責任不同的各種職務中間，聽權最大而事務又最繁的就要算是「總務」了；一個總務主任的日薪，照一般地説來二十　可賺到四十元到六十元之間，其次如「業務」主任，這是一種對絲業商業都要有豐富經騐的人才，才祗可以勝任，不過在事務方面他是比「總務」要淸閒得多了，所以他得到廠方的報酬也和總務主任不相上下。至於廠長的職務便大不相同了，他不僅要對絲業有很豐富的經驗，而且還必須是一個能够實際動手工作的技術人材。他在事務方面要負全廠的責任，在生産方面要和工程師一樣的具備改善產品的技能，因此廠方對他待遇的豐厚，和整個公司的經理並沒有遜色。工程師祗是專門的職務，大概最高的報酬是不會超過一百元的；不過這許多高級職員，他們除了拿到優厚的薪水之外，到了年底都還分得一筆很大的「花紅」，這在一般普通工人，却是不敢懷這種奢望的。</p>
<p>工人們的工作，都是事先由廠裏劃分了部門；一般絲廠的工作大致是分這麽幾種：車間，絲間，抄間，剝間，絲頭間。一個車間工作的人數，總括的說就得佔全數百分之七十，有的車間還不止這麽多；其次，絲頭間，抄間的工人人數，平均約各佔全數百分之十。車間的工作個別的分析起來，又得分為：長車，替車，打盆三種；打盆的工作，完全是由童工担任，兩架車子才祗用一個童工。長車是每架車子一個人，這種工作多半是要十六七歲的女子，才有資格够得上這種報酬較好的位置。替車是不能算作正式的工作部門，因為這種工作的主旨，祗是在預備長車上有缺席的工人，才把她補上去代替工作；所以做這種工作的人，有時是沒有一定的數目。</p>
<p>一般地說來，長車上的工作要比別的部門艱難得多了；從毛繭入鍋起，中間經過抽絲，辨別絲的好壞，繅折的大小，顔色的等次，這許多都非有充分的腦力不能幹得好的手續，完全要由管長車的工人一樣樣地做到。自然，一個長車工人的具有這種本領，决不是一蹴而就可以成功；普通一個長車工人，至少須受三年以上的訓練才能畢業。</p>
<p>絲間的工作，也是由女工担任；這種工作很是輕鬆，可是任務却是相反的綦重。絲間的工作，可分為接頭，絞絲兩個部份；接頭的工作，是把男工揀出來的糙絲，再由她們把糙絲删掉，仍舊把絲頭接連起來，這接頭的手續就算成功。絞絲的工作還要容易簡單，祗要把一掛一掛的絲，絞成像「脆毛花」似的形式，就算完成了絞絲的手續。至於説她們的責任綦重，那是因為一包絲到打包時的最後檢騐手續，也是由她們料理的緣故。</p>
<p>抄間的工作，也不是一般人所能勝任愉快，這是要將一堆無數的繭子，揀出牠的成色的好壞，分別的列出頭二三號的等級。但剝間和絲頭間的工作，就容易多了；剝間的工作是一種用指力的工作，祗要剝掉繭子的外衣，就算完成了一樁手續。絲頭間是非健壯的婦女不行；因為絲頭是要經過一番的敲洗和扯鬆的手續，假如腕力不健的婦女，簡直是無法勝任的。</p>
<p>這許多部門工作的待遇，最好的要算長車上的工人；因爲她們在一般的工人中間，也可算得是一種專門的技術人材。她們每天的工資，大概是三角六分至六角錢左右，最多的也不會超過一元；筫過最近的工資却祗有三角到四角之間，再也莫想像從前那末優厚的收入了。絲間和抄間工人的工作，在以前也不過得五角至七角一天的代價，到了現在更祇能和從前的數目打個對折計算了。至於剝間及絲頭間工人的工資，那是一種照貨算錢的活動工資。一個熟手女工，一天賺到的及價，最高也不過　之　　洋；生手女工，那簡直説不上工錢，一天到晚手不停揮的工作的結果，大致　天約可賺到二百文。</p>

<h3>自由與必然</h3>
<p>— 德崇</p>
<p>人類的意識和行為是自由的呢，還是為必然所限制的呢？這是自來在思想界中論爭看的一個最重要的問題。據一般宗教家和觀念論者看來，人類的意識和行爲是絶對自由的，並不受什麽限制。他們説：人是萬物之靈，人的意識能支配一切，創造一切；你看，一切文明，一切制度，不都是人創造出來的嗎？可是，創造一切的人的意識與行爲又是從何而來的呢？一般宗教家和觀念論者都不能科學地與行動歸之於天賦，終於將問題的解决交與神秘的上帝了。事實上，人類的意識乃是在其所生活的環境中形成的，其行為更是受這由生活環境所形成的意識之規定的。原始時代的人，因為生產工具很幼稚，隨時隨地都受到自然的制約，作自然的奴隸，府以，他們只能成群結隊地去與猛獸鬥爭，只能「茹毛飲血」以充饑，「穴居野處」以安身；絶對不能發生住洋房，喫大餐的心理和意識，因而也就不能有製造這些東西的行動。在過去中國幼稚的農業社會中，人們的生活完全依靠於幼稚的農業之上，如果那年是「風調雨順」，得到豐收，那他們便可過較好的生活，否則便有受饑餓的危險；所以，那時的中國人便只有把一切希望付之於老天，祈禱「風調雨順」，得到豐收，絶不會發生用科學的方法來製造雨水，用電力來耕種田地的意識和行爲；雖然在過去中國的一切神怪小說中，有呼風喚雨的道人，也有騰雲上天遁土入地的神仙，但這只是此時的人在感到自然界的魔力而又不能理解它的情形之下所產生的一種玄妙思想，並不是現實的事情。因此，我們的意見與一般宗教家和觀念論者的恰恰相反，我們以為人類的意識與行為並非自由的，而是受着自然與社會之必然地規定的；生活在什麽樣的自然與社會環境中的人，必然會發生某種意識與行為，而不能發生别種意識與行爲，在這點上，人類是自然與社會的奴隸，其意識與行爲不是自由的，而是由必然所制約着的。</p>
<p>然而，人不僅是順應環境地生活，而且還能改變環境以使其生活日益改善。如果人只能順應環境，作自然與社會的奴隸，不能改變和克服牠們，那人類就無所謂進化，人類社會之進化，便是人類不斷與自然和社會鬥爭之結果。但是，人類之改變社會，征服自然，乃是在其理解自然與社會之必然性下遂行的；人類之能改變社會和征服自然到什麽程度，當以其認識自然與社會之必然性到了什麽程度來决定。在一定的時間與空間內，如果人能理解自然與社會之必然性，那便能在這理解下，自由地處理它們，因而便由自然與社會的奴隸變為它們的主人了，其意識與行為也可說是自由的了。譬如説，當我們不理解水之必然性時，我們遇到了汪洋大海便毫無辦法，反之，假如我們理解了水之一切，從而知道船在水上不會沉沒，能够隨意行動，那我們使可乘着船在水上行動，渺茫無際的江水對於我們也就不能限制了。於此我們便可說是自由的。又如，在封建社會即要傾覆，資本主義社會快要誕生的時代中，如果我們不知道社會發展之必然性，努力去擁護封建社會，那便是老鼠鑽牛角，越鑽越緊，終於會被社會發展之必然性將我們推入墳墓；反之，倘若我們認識了這個社會的必然性，從而决定我們的行動，那我們便成爲了引導社會前進的主人，在這點上便是自由的。所以黑格爾認爲「自由乃必然之洞察」；因格爾士也說：「自由不外是根據於自然的必然性之理解的，對於我們自己與外部自然的支配。所以自由必然是歷史發展的産物。」因爲人能日益認識客觀事物之本質，理解其必然性，所以在歷史的發展中人便能依據對此必然性之認識以支配必然性，這便是自由</p>
<p>同時，在一定的時間與空間內，我們由於認識社會發展之必然性而支配此必然性，實踐地推進社會之發展，使這必然性成為現實性。在這中間，我們因認識必然性而成爲其主人，而獲得自由，從而更在這認識下實踐地推進社會之發展，於此我們的認識與實踐便成爲了歷史前進的主要條件，而自由也就轉化爲必然了。</p>
<p>因此，自由與必然並不是絶對對立着的。我們必須要正確地理解其矛盾而又統一的關係，才能正確的决定我們的行動。如果只注意客觀事物之必然性，認爲在這必然性下人類只能任隨一切自然生長，毫無辦法，那便是毫無用處的宿命論者；反之，如果不管這客觀的必然性，只相信人類的創造力，以爲人力是絶對可以勝天，那便是不着實際的空想主義者。兩者都是不對的。我們必須要去理解客觀的必然性，從而去支配這必然性，以推進社會之發展：這樣的正確地理解自由與必然之關係下，去决定我們的生活態度，去决定我們的行為。</p>
<p>我們知道，在原始時代，人類是自然的奴隸，後來隨着社會之發展，隨着人類對自然的必然性之認識，人類是逐漸地在克服自然，支配自然的；及至現代，因爲産業的發展，科學的發明，人類是更能由理解自然之必然性而支配其必然性了，現在可説是自然對於人類也没有了多大的阻碍力，所謂作爲自然之奴隸的人已經漸漸成爲自然的主人了。可是，就是現在，社會關係對於人類尚有很大的壓廹力，人類還是社會關係的奴隸，所以人類要獲得完全的自由，尚須改革或改良這社會關係，以縮短由「必然的王國到自由的王國」的飛躍過程。</p>

<h3>人的解剖</h3>
<p>— 啓明</p>
<p>人，這是一個不大不小的動物。要説他小，那麽在顯微鏡下的微生物，單細胞的原生物，阿米巴等等，不知比他小若干倍。要説他大嗎？那麽他就比之熱帶大森林中的巨象，也要小數倍至十數倍；若比之於海中巨獸的鯨魚，那是更牟小上數十百倍了。因爲人的重量，大概只在六七十斤至百斤左右而已，而鯨魚則重至千斤萬斤。可是人這種動物雖只是不大不小的中等動物，但其聰明智慧之精神生活的表現却自來成爲哲學家所探求的一個神秘之謎。許多觀念論的哲學家是把人的理性當作神聖的恩賜品，認爲這不是物質世界所能自具的一種能力，而是特殊的神性的表現。比如柏拉圖早就以爲人居於神與形質世界之間，他的肉身墮落在污濁的物質世界之中，而精神則是屬於神的世界。在達爾文的進化論出世的當時，華雷司仍主張人的精神是靈性的注入。就是近今的科學家湯姆生罷，他也還在説人類的精神是突然發現的。當然，在十八世紀的法蘭西百科全書派，是始終堅信人的精神是和他的肉體一樣，乃基於自然的物質而産生的，他的精神就是他的殊異於別種動物的物質組織的機能表現出來的</p>

<p>常識</p>
<h3>關於常識的常識</h3>
<p>— 坦然</p>
<p>「常識都不够，你配得上過問這件事情嗎？」</p>
<p>這樣的話，在許多地方被人們用為責備他人的斷語，由此可見常識在日常生活中的重要。那麽，「常識」究竟是什麽東西呢？</p>
<p>關於「何謂覚識」的問題，若依科學系統的研究，自有極豐富的解釋「常識」問題的理論與材料，不過，我們的讀者既然是乘「業餘」之暇來看文章，那麽，我們不能不設法從最明白簡單的事象起頭，提出關於「常識」的問題。現在，我們先來講一個故事罷：</p>
<p>在不久以前，有一位留學回國的農學博士，他精通農業的經營法，又熟習關於農作的各科技術。他從外國跑到自己的家鄉—甘肅省，首先邀約了幾位熱心事業的朋友，集資數百萬元購買數十頃肥沃的田地；又花費一百餘萬元，從歐洲購得電力耕作機和收割機若干架。此外，他又訂購了數十萬元的肥田粉和種子，僱用數百農民之後，新式的農塲居然迅速地建設起來了。可是，過了一年以後，忽然間農學博士的事業破産了。</p>
<p>朋友們都説農學博士的「運氣」不好，地方上的鄉民也議論着，説農學博士「用洋貨」便是「賣國」，共結果，當然要受「天誅地滅」。</p>
<p>在這件事情中間，我們可以得到很好的材料。我們首先在這裏發現；農學博士之所以在事前下積極進行自己的事業的决心，完全是由於他的農學知識研究得高深，以他極科學化的農業「常識」决然地進行自己的計劃。但他的失敗，不是因爲他的農學知識不够。所成問題的，却是由於他的社會經濟「常識」不够。因為，他的農産品的成本，是由肥田粉，機器成本的一部份搆成的，比普通當地其他小農民的出產品耗費較高。而且他的大量生産品，在甘肅地方一時銷售不出去，亦無人敢於以過高的價錢向津。於是，他只得把生產品運往省外。但省外運費極大，結果是僱用力夫把幾千石穀米運往陝西，但亦毫無購買者領教。終於是資本週轉不靈，新式農塲在落後的環境中只得倒台了。在這次經騐中，我們顯然知道，這位農學博士只能在一個交通發達而社會經濟又異常分工化的先進國家內充任一位技師，由他的專們知識指導新式農塲是最適宜不過的。因為在那種環境所需要的「常識」正是這位農學博士所熟習的知識。反之，在甘肅地方的農民所經營的小事業之所以不倒台，而反勝過於農學博士的經營，其原因亦正因爲他們的「常識」恰合於那樣的環境。可是，正因爲這些「老鄉們」只了解那裏社會生活的局部現象，對於全國經濟與外國技術或經濟之科學的知識不够的關係，所以，他們就斷言，農學博士「用洋貨」「賣國」，必然要受「天誅地滅」。這裏又是「常識」不够的緣故。因爲「天誅地滅」的斷語，是老鄉們落後的「迷信觀念」所引出來的。而且，農學博士的「用洋貨」，不是爲消費，而是用在生産事業上，照理是没有「賣國」的。從這一點看來，可知『老鄉們』是只有適合於落後地方耕作的『常識』，對於『排斥外國商品』及反帝國主義的正確觀念，是隔膜在十萬八千里之遠的。他們這種『常識』上的缺憾，正是和所謂『天誅地滅』的迷信觀念相配合着的。</p>
<p>由這樣一段故事所給與我們的興趣，便是『常識』不够或不普遍化的缺憾，必然要使人迷離徬徨於複雜廣大的人類社會中。我們如果能細心注意到許多日常類似於這樣的事情，幾乎隨時可以碰着人們顛沛於『常識』不够或不普遍化的苦悶之中。這是什麽緣故呢？『常識』這個東西，是否可以設法使人人都能具備呢？要到什麽情形之下，所謂『常識』才能完全被人應用而無遺漏呢？</p>
<p>要解答以上諸問題，當然不是幾旬話就可以滿足的。在這些問題的構成份子中，一方面是包含着人類知識程度的問題。而一切關於常識問題的研究，又是與人類實踐過程中科學化與普遍化的教育工作不可分離的。在道短文之中，我們只能提出這樣的幾個標凖：</p>
<p>第一，正確的『常識』應該是科學所容許的。『常識』應該以破除迷信為成立的要件。</p>
<p>第二，日常生活中的衣，食，住，行所屢次表現的方法與現象不是屬於『常識』的，它們是習慣的題材。『常識』，是世間複雜現象與事物本質中的簡明因果關係構成體。但它不是專門的科學，因爲科學的真確性，是在繼續不斷的演進中成立的。所以『常識』這個東西，它不過是科學所已經解决了的知識，它是人們日常普遍接觸事象時所需要的工具。</p>
<p>第三，常識不是屬於局部的專門知識。人們每以自己所研究的專門學問爲滿足，即自信『常識充分』而嘲笑他人之未學其專門知識者爲常識不够。這是要失敗的，這猶如認此等人物未曾『精通百科』即不成爲學者是一樣的謬誤。因此，我們認定：『常識』是各種科學之普遍溶化於事象的總體。人類的『常識』是與社會及科學之發達程度成正比例的。</p>

<p>。但他們尚不敢承認人類是從自然物質進化而來，精神亦是那樣產生出來的，因此他們仍然是在那承認好久以前即預存於宇宙間之永遠不變的人性論中旋回。對於人類的精神，在折學上近代的新哲學已經正確地認識了，即認它是和人類的肉體一樣，乃是自然長期進化的產物，沒有物質的肉體便没有精神。但就在這裏，因為實際的科學如生理學，心理學等等，尚未達到很精細，完美，充分地說明人的全般精神狀態時，遂使那些純經騐主義的科學家，仍在這個關頭上猶豫不决，不敢毅然否定人類精神之超自然的本質。那末，在人的解剖上，我們應該怎樣去認識他的精神現象這一部分東西呢？就單純的自然性質來説，精神必須附屬於物質以存在，思想不能不先有肉體的頭腦，人類的精神和理性以此便不是靈性的注入或突然變異出來的靈物，而是自然長期進化之物質的特殊組織的特種機能表現的結呆。假使有人問這種論斷是否正確，那麽我們可以請他回想一下，切了腦袋的人不是不但不能再思想，不能再當哲學家，科學象，道德學家，而且也不能繼續生存嗎？這是一種常識，但這一常識就是人的解剖之精神現象那一部分的科學認識，比甚麽觀念論哲學都要正確的。</p>
<p>人的自然物質，其組織的機能所表現的精神現象固然是很奥妙而值得驚奇的，其實，就是它的肉體的發生，發展和組織，也一樣可以令人驚奇叫絶。人類的開始亦僅為一種生殖細胞，此種生殖細胞在男性的謂之精虫，在女性的謂上卵子，這都是要在顯微鏡下才看得出來的。像人這樣大，這樣靈巧的東西，就由那看不見的小體長成的，這已爲近代科學所研究明白的了。人類的精虫，全體只有一分之五十分之一左右那樣長，就是說人的原始種子只是一分之五十分之一左右那樣長的小虫。精虫的運動能力每分鐘速度爲三·六米里米突，牠在輸精管中雖然可活到二三月，但在女性體內如果不和卵子給合就只能生活十天左右。人類産生精虫的能力非常可驚，一星期可以産生一萬二千六百二十五萬個，每次性交要放出二萬萬至三萬萬個。精虫和卵子結合以後，即搆成一個受胎細胞，這細胞在母體內由一而二，由二而四，由四而八而十六不斷地的分離下去，搆成人的各種器官。人的全身到成人時計算起來大概有四百萬萬萬之多的細胞，其在母體內發育之速，以二百八十日胎體生活計，至少每日平均要繁殖九十萬萬，這是多麽可驚的一些數目啊！至於這些細胞的新陳代謝和由牠的分裂怎麽分别組成分工的各種器官，這是生理學上專門的問題，我們且不去說它。這裏我們還須説一説的，只是細胞為人的身體組織的單位，但細胞並非終極質素，牠乃由分子組成，而分子則由原子組成。我恍惚記得一部書上說過，人全身的原子是有一十的七十二乘冪那樣多的數目，這個數目就在紙上寫起來也是很困難的，那麽人體的複雜便可以想見了。的確，如果我們又把每個原子都看作一個太陽系，因爲電子是圍繞原子核旋轉的，則人的全身是由比天空的銀河還要複雜的若干太陽系組成的。我們試閉目一思，就可以想像人是無窮的一團一團的飛輪，懸空地在那裏攪擾旋轉，亦可喻為美麗的宇宙大觀。然而在電子與電子，原子與原子，分子與分子之間呢？則又皆有很多的空隙，如果把這些電子原子揑攏一堆，則四五尺高大的人又可以變成雞蛋小的肉團。這樣奇異的人體組織，却以物理化學的作用而表現其精神現象，所以如果説精神現象是神秘可驚的，那麽牠的組織狀態不是一樣可驚的嗎？生物，宇宙的物質現象，人是盡其極端微妙之秘了，無怪乎人能被稱爲萬物之靈呢。</p>

<h3>祖孫之間</h3>
<p>— 史瑩</p>
<p>寒風呼峭的冬天。</p>
<p>中午，陽光是那樣幽柔的曬在村落上。</p>
<p>阿花安恬地横陳在竹離門邊，瞇細着眼。偉成同他的老祖父也在柴堆旁邊面對着太陽取温暖；鬍子上有着白花鬚的老人，年紀是上了八十歳，雖然精神依然那樣矍鑠的，但古銅色的額頭，已刻劃了風霜中經歷的記號，他穿着一身臃腫破舊的棉襖，靛色中已褪出了白色，腰間也束上一條藍作裙，兩鬢的白髮在破了洞的氈帽裏透出來。</p>
<p>老人口腔中的咳嗆，緊接着；震得滿臉通紅，直至眼淚和涕水都流在臉頰上了，才鬆了一口氣將作裙來把淚水拭去了。</p>
<p>——不行了，人已活夠了年紀啦！偉成，等不及你畢業不畢業，我怕早已不在人世了。</p>
<p>年青人聽到了這話，也着實有點感傷，心頭也正如冬天一樣的荒凉。嘴裏説：</p>
<p>——公公，不是明年暑天嗎？</p>
<p>但老人想到的，總不外那些老人應該想到的事：他瞇細着眼縫，看到面前長成的年青人，壯健結實的軀幹，文雅瀟洒的容貌，使老人感到滿足，——三十年來苦心的期待，居然得到了眼前的收獲，雖然一家的人只剩得祖孫二人。——但終又因為另一件事，使他感到不足了。他懊悔自己送孫子走什麽學堂，東村阿錫不是和偉成同年嗎？阿錫的爸是有了三個孫子的祖父了。可是偉成念了書，脾氣就發了怪，老是說舉業不畢業的。</p>
<p>老人的念頭使自己静默着。</p>
<p>偉成知道祖父又想到什麽事了，他跑進堂屋，取了一塊畫板，奔回尚在沈思的祖父身旁，對着祖父説：</p>
<p>——公公坐忽兒，遇到好太陽，我爲公公畫個像。</p>
<p>——唉，你們學生子就只會做這些玩意兒！</p>
<p>説這話時，心裏是有一部分同意。把自己的形容，留到後世去，果然是一種老人的願望，但老人的最大的願望，是在他生前重新再有一翻喜悦的熱鬧，希望孫媳婦早早進屋，望到他們捉對兒的。</p>
<p>老年人的願望顯然與青年人隔着一個世紀。</p>
<p>年青人是用心在尺幅中，對着面前的老人，又俯着，用筆觸精細地劃在紙張上。</p>
<p>暮冬的寒風，剛峭地。太陽從樹梢漏到樹蔭裏，天氣變得萬分陰沈。老人耐不得這落日前的寒冷，咳嗆得更加頻繁。</p>
<p>阿花伸伸腰，逕自走了。</p>

<p>名人傳記</p>
<h3>愛因斯坦傳（六）</h3>
<p>— 從木</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>愛因斯坦在一九一二年的秋天，作了基里契工科大學的教授，其後，在一九一四年春，他便移居在柏林了，所以上面所説的一切中，有許多都是他移居柏林以後的事情。</p>
<p>在基里契時，他是正教授。柏林的聘請，則是把他當作普雷孫的正會員並兼柏林大學的教授的，其待遇與大學正教授相同。在他未到柏林之前，柏林大學的教授荷蘭人化學家凡特·霍兹夫於一九一一年逝世了，他便是塡的這位化學家的空位；同時，他又被勸兼任了該扎，斐爾愛姆研究所的物理部長。這樣的位置，向來只是給與學界中的耆老的，但此時愛因斯坦才祗三十五六歲，這是全靠勃蘭克，萊倫斯特等之盡力推薦的。</p>
<p>當時德國各地方的大學，都各自發展以爭學界之覇權，但柏林乃德國文化的中心，仍然佔着很重要的地位，現在又府了勃蘭克與愛因斯坦兩大科學家，當然更是可以誇耀的了，特别是在物理學上。這時在柏林的愛因斯坦與其在伯倫結婚的夫人分離了，而與其自幼就相愛好的從妹愛露沙夫人結了婚。</p>
<p>愛氏的一般相對性原理的研究，是一九一三年在基里契進行的，一九一四年以後，在柏林又繼續研究，到一九一五和一九一六年時才算完成；厌後，他的研究更走進了宇宙論的問題。這些研究的結果，主要地都是在普雷孫的學土院發表。在這中間，光量子論也是他所宿願的問題，一九一七年他在「關於輻射的量子論」的論文中，依據在波亞的原子模型中的，從軌道到軌道的電子之飛躍，而說明輻射之發散，吸收，把其飛躍當作如在放射現象中的自然的情形，於此導入於「碓率」的意想，依據統計的平衡，誘出了勃蘭克的法則。這個創造的思想，對於量子論的發展，給與了很重要的意義；而依據一九一九年五月二十九日英國天文學者的觀測全部日蝕之結果，在同年十一月六日於倫敦發表之後、相對性原理並愛因斯坦之名便宣傳於世界了。（未完）</p>

<h3>電影發達的簡史（六）（續一月十一日）</h3>
<p>— 文瀛</p>
<p>（六）草創時代演員冒險的一斑</p>
<p>前文略述「電影發達的簡史」，前此曾有五段披露於本刋（本年一月七至十一日）這是第六段。以前所講的五段中，第一段所講的是，電影觀衆從最早的時期起，就是造就電影事業的主人翁。現在電影事業之所以能成爲美國六大企業中之一，以及在世界藝術，文化，教育，多方，佔有極重要的地位，也都是我們觀衆們高興化錢去看，和熱心提倡之所致。第二段所講的是，一位李蘭史丹福，因爲要證明一匹馬在馳騁極速的時候，是四蹄騰空的，於是就費了若干年的心血，發明了聯綴影片的攝製，以及由許多鏡箱並交連綴攝影，進一歩而成一隻鏡箱連續拍攝若干影片的空想。第三段是講大發明家艾廸生，和他的副手迭克生，努力於這種空想，以至於「活動西洋景」的發明，以及第一張活動影片，「火車鉅刦案」公映時的盛况等。第四段所講的是，「明星制度」的由來與勃興，以及影后曼麗璧克馥的初次登塲。第五段所講的是，明星制度的勃興，是因爲觀衆們崇拜明星之所致，以及當時宣傳工作虚僞的情形。第五段之後，因原文未全，特輟登，今以原文續到，再繼續下去。</p>
<p>那時時候幾個女演員，她們大膽冒險的精神，亦是近代所少見的，我們可以順便提一提。那個時候有一個女明星，叫愛麗絲喬伊斯（Alice　Jcyce），她本來是舞臺劇配角。無事時，就做做藝術家的模特兒。她因爲電影界的薪水大些，很想進電影界。她揑造了一段故事，説她善於騎術，不亞於一個坎塔磯的騎師。電影公司因爲那時的女騎師缺少，就錄用了她。等到要拍戲的那天，就將她放在一匹馬背上，叫她在鐵路當中向前奔馳，攝取後面火車追趕那匹馬的危險情形。愛麗絲實在生平没有騎過一次馬，但是她如何没有摔死，亦没有被火車壓死，連她自己都莫名其妙。可是從此之後，她在電影界的地位，亦就穩固了。</p>
<p>風騷大明星葛蘿利亞史璜蓀（Gloria　Swanson），當初亦是富於冒險性，將她的性命握在手裏拍戲的。在西席地米爾的一張老片子之中，有一幕是模倣臚一幅名畫「獅妻」拍的。雖然幕景很短，但那女主角却必須走進了獅籠，和獅子睡覺，並且要使獅子將兩爪爬在她的肩上，作親暱之狀。當然，他們不能没有相當的準備。於是籠子的旁邊站滿了人，手裏拿着來福槍，對獅子瞄準了。但是，葛蘿利亞自己亦明白，倘使那獅子一口將她的頭咬了下來，他們將獅子打死，亦是没有用的了。再則在許多槍管齊聲開放的時候，難保她自己不中一槍。</p>
<p>但是那時的葛蘿利亞，却是膽大包身的。况且大家都稱讚她是個勇敢無比的女子，她豈肯畏葸不前，自墮聲譽。她就在這狂醉之中，鑽進了獅籠，開始拍戲了。很可喜的，一切都順當無事，但是很可惋惜的，鏡頭臨時出了毛病。等到葛蘿利亞從籠子裏跳出來的時候，導演先生告訴她説：「對不起，剛才一幕没有拍好。請你照樣重來一下子」。這一下子，却使葛蘿利亞氣得暈倒了。</p>
<p>第二次入籠，却是葛蘿利亞生平所做的最難的一樁事了。第一次入籠前，精神上的狂醉，已經銷散了。那種勇敢已經難再提起了。她已經深切明瞭那種冷酷的危險。但是她却不得不拚了性命，再度的走進獅子籠。等到她從籠子裏出來的時候，她差不多神經已經衰弱到極度，不得不叫人抬到化妝室去。她的肩上，是獅子的爪印，衣服上的珠子都壓碎，嵌進嫩皮肉裏去了。</p>
<p>這種事情，在現在是不會發生的了。在這個地方，他們可以用替身。她是在那個時候，他們除了自己冒險之外，却想不出别的法子。凱塞琳威廉，亦是那時拍攝野獸片的女主角。她亦是將性命握在手裏拍戲的。或者在那個草創的時代，一切的人，如同上古的人一樣，比較現在的一般人，要膽子大些。（未完）</p>
<h3>「閨怨」中的一隻狗每週薪水五十元</h3>
<p>— 馥</p>
<p>去年在南京大戲院放映的「閨怨」（Tht　Barretts　of　Wimpole　Streef），是瑙瑪希拉，弗德立馬區，却爾斯賴甫登三大明星的合作品。大概看過的人，還不至於健忘吧。裏面尤令人不能忘懷的，就是那隻狗。他的名字呌富來喜（Flush）。現在我略爲談談	他的一些事蹟。</p>
<p>他是黄白夾雜的史班尼種，生於一九三一年的十月七日。他的主人買了來。是預備教他打獵的，但是他的主人後來説：（他的兩耳距離太濶，用來打獵太可惜了）。那就是説他的腦筋太豐富了，頗有呌他拍電影的意思。</p>
<p>富來喜被電影公司從七十五條同種的狗裏，選了出來，因爲他的兩眼富有表情，並且他的耳朶特别的長！毛髮垂垂，光亮像絲一樣。他在開拍影戲之前，在一個訓練員手下，受了一個半月的訓練。那個訓練員説，在他若干年的經騐之中，他是最善於體貼人的意思的了。</p>
<p>訓練員在訓練期中，和狗一同起臥，親手飼養他，博得他完全的信任。他的性質喜静，不喜喧譁。訓練員教他跟着符號的指示動作。當訓練他在街上行走的時候，用一條六十尺的繩，呌他站在一端，訓練員徐徐抽着繩，狗就徐徐跟着繩頭走。走完了，他有一塊奶餅吃。他爬門的時候，是因爲訓練員在門裏呌他的緣故。他從樓梯口，向樓下張望，是因爲訓練員在樓下引他注意的緣故。但是演來，却和懂得劇情的人一樣。</p>
<p>富來喜每演一幕劇，一定要練習好幾天。如果那幕的佈景正在應用，就替他另造一個同樣的佈景。訓練員很小心的，不敢同時教他好幾樣技巧，恐怕他思想紊亂了。</p>
<p>富來喜和瑙瑪希拉早已成了很好的朋友。在她拍Rip-Tide的時候，他就跟着她跑來跑去，瑙瑪希拉坐下，他就跳在她的身上。在「閨怨」中，他們維持了友誼。</p>
<p>可是却爾斯賴甫登却不能和他發生友誼。因爲在影片裏，他是嚴父，狗要見他怕而恨他。所以拍片子的時候，自始至終，狗走過他的身旁，從來不望他一望。並且在影片中，却爾斯的高聲説話，厲聲斥責，更使狗心懷憤恨了。但當瑙瑪哭泣的時候，那隻狗就覺得無限的悲傷。她笑的時候，狗亦非常的快活。</p>
<p>很可笑的，富來喜莊重得很，走起路來，像一位老牧師似的規矩。他從來不求吃。那或者因爲他是一家之主的緣故。他家裏有五個孩子。他賺的薪水是每星期五十元，但他却不用顧家用，因爲那五個孩子，都有大明星認領了去了。</p>
<h3>「舊約新盟」碎金</h3>
<p>— 止水</p>
<p>别樹一幟，獨創作風的大導演梵達克氏，他曾經導演米高梅三部巨片，就是「大偵探聶克」（按這部名片爲第一次改變偵探片作風而成功的，聽説不久將在麗都作第二輪的公映）「愛司基摩」，與「俠友」。那「俠友」爲瓊克勞馥，克拉克蓋博爾，和洛勃脱蒙高茂萊初度三星合作的偉構。於今捲土重來，這三位銀幕大情人，在梵達克導演之下，攝製了一九三五年最前綫的三角戀愛浪漫喜劇。</p>
<p>好萊塢共有五位女明星，她們的裝飾，往往佔全美風氣之先的，那是瓊克勞馥，瑙瑪希拉，葛雷泰嘉寶，康絲登裴納，與卡洛朗白。可是五美中却是瓊傲居首席，因爲她的美麗，能够十足代表現代女性們模型，所以不僅男子們爲瓊心神顛倒，女士們也認她爲唯一的安琪兒呢。</p>
<p>配景配色的技術，對於全片光綫情調，都有極大關係的。不是失之太晦闇，便是過在太鮮明。太晦闇呢，當然使觀者發生不快感觸，而過於鮮明，却又覺得凌亂耀眩之患。例如在「閨怨」中十八世紀的時代背景，無疑地要令人起慘淡少精彩之想，可是藝術家妙手畢竟彌補了這個缺點，而在「舊約新盟」裏，採用了吾國各類黄綠珊瑚各色花紙，反射出無量的輕鬆鮮明活潑美麗之快感。可見事在人爲了。</p>
<p>瓊克勞馥飾新娘時，所御的嫁衣，稱爲一九三五新娘式禮服。它是以卵形垂緣，玫瑰花蕊式邊緣，和圍裙而成的有廻風蕩雪般態姿，即面紗亦係俊品。它是短前脩後，非常美觀的。同時佳禮中所用的禾花（Corn　Fliwer）共計六萬二千四百盆之多。</p>
<h3>閑話「楊柳春風」</h3>
<p>— 國城</p>
<p>茀雷亞斯坦與琴述羅吉絲，以前合演的偉人歌舞片「錦繡天」，我們已有了評價，他倆人的新片「楊柳春風」！現在又運到滬上來了。</p>
<p>這是一部頗值得我們注意的歌舞詼諧的巨片，除了許多舞台上的紅星在這片中露臉，導演也仍爲前「錦繡天」的歌舞指導擔任。</p>
<p>茀雷亞斯坦與琴述羅吉絲已是我們早已熟悉的了，所以在這裏想專談一談關於一百五十位的美艷舞女的新聞。這一百五十位的漂亮的姑娘！全是經過歌舞上的嚴格的訓練而預備應用在楊柳春風的French　Doll舞蹈的塲面中的。但因爲人們覺得姑娘們的大腿已不很值錢了，所以便希望她們在微小的動作時，能以手指來代替足部去跳舞。</p>
<p>在這樣的要求之下，只有十六位舞女受到了及格的容納。實在也是因爲用手指來代替足部舞蹈，那是遠比獨脚跳舞都要困難許多。</p>
<p>「楊柳春風」值得我們注意的並非這一點，它供獻給我們許多最新式的跳舞的姿式與一九三五式交際舞的姿式等，都是非常可取爲參考的。尤其是五位名編曲家所編作的許多歌曲在該片中出現，也很值得提一提。</p>

<h3>學童慈母（Crand　Old　Girl）（七）</h3>
<p>— 叔敏</p>
<p>桑狄走了一段，忽然將汽車停了下來。他對着撅着嘴的吉莉道：「有件東西我早就想給你了。」他説完了，亦不給她一個自衛的機會，就將她一把揪了過來，掀在自己大腿上，狠狠地打着她的屁股。吉莉被他一打，並且打得很重，不覺哭了起來。很古怪的，她的這個哭倒不是憤恨的哭，亦不是覺得寃枉的哭，亦不是因爲疼的哭。她覺悟到這次做得太過份了。密司貝爾斯前此曾經屢次警告過她，不要做得太過份了。那時，她不服氣地道：「我做得過份些，亦碍不着别人的事。頂多我害我自己好了！」可是現在她却害了密司貝爾斯了，她就是懊悔亦來不及了，</p>
<p>吉莉被打了一頓屁股，反而服服貼貼的，坐在桑狄旁邊，一聲不響的回到城裏。桑狄亦半天不説話，但是這種静默，却别有一般滋味。他雖爲密司貝爾斯的前途害怕，却爲他乎吉莉的前途，生了一種新的希望。</p>
<p>到了明天，約瑟傑賴召集了教育會議。在那會議之中，大家默不作聲的，聽着他的演説：「她以前任意譏嘲我們……她吃了公家的俸祿，應當教育兒童，不應當將兒童作她的試騐品……因此，我請求……不是請求，我是要求……將這個老悖的校長撤職……這樣才可以保全我們這淸潔社會的名譽！」</p>
<p>露拉貝爾斯照舊的從她的學校裏走了出來，要回家去。她走過「前房」的門口，不覺歎了一口氣，看着裏面是漆黑的。她的心血，她的金錢，統通是白用了。並且在那門上，釘着一塊牌子，上面寫着：「教育局封」幾個大字，這就是她致命之傷，她看了不覺愁然。正在這個當兒，她看見對面房子前面，克拉倫斯戴德站在那裏。她不甘示弱，勉强的裝出没有事似的微笑，對着克拉倫斯道：「克拉倫斯，你又佔了勝利了。你又將亞芳臺爾打倒了。我有被你征服了……」</p>
<p>可是克拉倫斯戴德並没有幸災樂禍的樣子。他心想着這老太婆着實有些骨氣，不覺心裏起了一個敬佩之心。於是他説道：「我正想着……或者你並没有做錯什麽事……或者我光賣冰淇淋，亦可以賺這幾個錢……或者……」他睁着眼看着她，覺得於心着實不忍。他繼續着道：「我想……我想將「前房」頂下來，將它作爲一個正當的營業。從今以後，再就没有什麽「後房」了。」他帶着看着希望她，還帶着一些自愧的苦笑。露蘭貝爾斯不覺欣然道：「克拉倫斯，你真是個好人。我覺得這樣才有意思，不管遇到什麽。」</p>
<p>他們正説得入港，一輛卡車經過他們的面前，車上擲了一綑報紙。戴德順手一接，將報紙抽出一張來，他看了一看説着：「不管我們將來成什麽人，至少你學生之中，已經有一個有出息的了。」他説着將報紙上的新聞指給她看。她一看，上面寫着大字標題：「總統不來亞芳臺爾。」下面較小的字是：「元首發表美國外交方針宣言，全世界爲之震驚；雖僅詎些二十里，却無暇訪問故里。」他們讀了那段新聞，不相視而笑。戴德道：「你想想，他小時候最易害羞，我們替他起了一個揮號，呌小姑娘。他的話現在可以使全世界震驚了！我想，這個震驚的事情，你至少有些份吧？」貝爾斯亦笑道：「不知道現在也演説的時候，忘記了句子，誰在旁邊提醒他。」可是戴徳默不作聲的眼瞪着那張報，臉上的笑容亦都收歛了起來。密司貝爾斯連忙問道：「什麽事？」（未完）</p>

<h3>British Suggests International Loans to China to the US, France, and Japan</h3>
<p>Aimed at Preventing a Sino-Japanese Economic Alliance</p>
<p>Tangible Evidence of British-American Cooperation</p>
<p>[London] The British government has requested the governments of the United States, France, and Japan to submit proposals for providing financial assistance to China. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>[London] In light of China's financial panic, Britain has separately invited the United States, Japan, France, and other countries to participate in a joint effort to aid China. Authorities here believe that the purpose of this action is not to hinder the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations, as no formal information has been received here regarding Sino-Japanese coordination. However, Britain is very willing to provide large-scale assistance to China in any form. Officials here acknowledge that the countries invited by Britain this time are the same ones that participated in the International Banking Consortium of 1920, but there is no need to utilize this organization again. The reason why Britain initiated this aid campaign for China this time stems from the request of Chinese and foreign banks in Shanghai. Considering the severity of China's financial panic, the British government feels that this campaign cannot be delayed any longer. Therefore, it accepted the proposal from Shanghai on one hand and sought the opinions of the United States, Japan, and France on the other. Although this action by Britain is not based on the Nine-Power Treaty, it follows the spirit of the treaty, which goes without saying. However, according to reports from British envoys stationed in China and Japan, the conditions that Japan wants China to accept do not involve turning China into its protectorate, and the Sino-Japanese negotiations are not expected to have any far-reaching results. British officials also stated that the discussions between Britain, the United States, France, and Japan have not yet reached an agreement on the scope and conditions of international loans to China. In short, Britain is extremely concerned about China's difficulties, and the Chinese government also feels that resolving the financial difficulties cannot be delayed any longer. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<h3>British Ambassador Visits the U.S. State Department</h3>
<p>[Washington] Today, the British Ambassador to the United States, Sir Ronald Lindsay, met with Under Secretary of State Phillips for about an hour. It is widely believed that the discussion focused on Far Eastern affairs. When reporters inquired of Phillips afterward, he replied that his discussion with the British Ambassador included an exchange of views between the British and American governments on several issues of mutual concern. Phillips did not specify what those issues were but then acknowledged that the United States is closely monitoring the development of Sino-Japanese efforts to foster amity. Observers here speculate on various possibilities, one being that several countries will jointly extend loans to China to alleviate its financial difficulties so that China does not have to enter into a new economic alliance with Japan. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>[Washington] Washington officials are currently considering the possibility of several governments jointly providing economic assistance to China to replace the recently rumored economic aid proposed by Japan to China. This news was learned by the Associated Press after a lengthy meeting between British Ambassador to the United States, Sir Ronald Lindsay, and Under Secretary of State Phillips. Some observers now believe that this cooperation is possible and may include the governments of Japan and other countries. Reliable sources claim that the policy of the United States favors China gathering strength to help itself under the Nine-Power Treaty and the International Banking Consortium agreement of 1920, instead of one country's individual assistance, for fear that the single country may enjoy exclusive rights, violating the principle of the Open Door Policy. Judging from the situation after the meeting between the British Ambassador and Phillips, Britain is clearly the originator of the proposal to aid China, evidently because Britain has huge economic interests in China. Some authorities generally believe that the U.S. government has expressed particular sympathy for this proposal because it can alleviate Chinese criticism of the adverse effects of the U.S. silver policy on China. Observers point out that Japan is taking advantage of China's financial emergency to advance its policies and complete its Monroe Doctrine in the Far East in exchange for special privileges in China. However, others say that China may use the hardship of being forced to befriend Japan to threaten Western countries and demand that the United States modify its silver purchase policy. (National Telegram, 1st)</p>
<h3>Based on the Spirit of the Nine-Power Treaty</h3>
<p>[London] Reuters diplomatic correspondent says that the British Ambassador Lindsay's talk with the U.S. State Department yesterday in Washington about the possibility of providing financial assistance to China is part of a general move, which is to determine what kind of assistance can be given to China to solve its current monetary difficulties. The Chinese government has discussed this situation with Britain and others, and bankers from Shanghai have made some proposals regarding the possibility of foreign loans. The British side has doubts about whether the current proposed plan can be implemented and feels that if a feasible plan can be put forward, Britain would like to see financial assistance to China on an international basis. Britain has notified the United States, Japan, and France of this concept because these three countries are members of the Four-Power Banking Consortium. However, the question of what action the Banking Consortium itself should take has not been raised. London firmly states that there is no question of proposing another method to replace the direct economic negotiations currently underway between China and Japan. As for any direct negotiations, there is no news here. The British feel that if an international plan can be achieved, Japan's participation would be necessary. Britain and other concerned countries are deeply aware of the difficulties China has encountered due to the silver problem, but no concrete measures have been considered yet. Britain has not negotiated with the United States about its silver policy. The discussions held recently in Washington, although considering the entire issue in the spirit of the Nine-Power Treaty, did not specifically mention the Nine-Power Treaty. As for direct political discussions between China and Japan, it is heard that the British Ambassadors stationed in Japan and China have now been informed of the progress by the authorities. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<h3>First Step of British-American Cooperation</h3>
<p>The meeting between Lindsay and Phillips is the first tangible indication that Britain and the United States may be able to cooperate on this matter. If the proposal for joint assistance to China is finalized, it will still be necessary to contact the other signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty. However, government officials declined to say whether this undertaking has been launched or is still in the planning stage.</p>
<h3>Japan Opposes Intervention by the Powers</h3>
<p>Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Saito, declared that to his knowledge, Japan has not aided China with any economic power. The purpose of the recent meetings between Japanese representatives and Chinese officials was to improve the general relationship between China and Japan, but it has not yet reached the stage of signing a special agreement. Demanding that China abandon its economic boycott of Japan is also under negotiation. Other well-informed Japanese sources say that Japan will oppose the joint intervention of the powers in the resumption of Sino-Japanese relations and any Japanese assistance to China that does not violate existing treaties. If the joint assistance proposed by Western countries does not disrupt Sino-Japanese relations and has legitimate reasons, Japan will also express sympathy. (National Telegram, 1st)</p>
<h3>Views of the Japanese Foreign Ministry</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] According to a telegram from Washington, the British Ambassador to the United States, Lindsay, visited the U.S. State Department to exchange views on the interests of Britain and the United States in China. The U.S. side widely rumored that the purpose of Sino-Japanese cooperation is to form a Sino-Japanese political and economic alliance and wanted to prevent Sino-Japanese cooperation. The Japanese Foreign Ministry felt quite regretful about the Anglo-American suspicion of Sino-Japanese cooperation and held the following views: The Japanese government firmly believes that maintaining friendly relations between China and Japan is something that all countries desire for peace in the Far East. Therefore, it is difficult to understand the suspicions of the powers about Sino-Japanese friendship efforts or the theories of preventing the implementation of Sino-Japanese friendship. As Foreign Minister Hirota stated in parliament, Sino-Japanese cooperation has not yet touched upon specific matters. However, since it is the unanimous opinion of China and Japan to resolve the pending issues between the two countries through diplomatic efforts and to regard Sino-Japanese diplomacy as equal diplomacy, the Japanese government has no intention of excluding the interests of Britain, the United States, and other countries in China from this cooperation. Now that there is talk of an Anglo-American proposal for international loans to China, Japan finds it difficult to understand its purpose. Because the Four-Power Loan Consortium has now become a mere shell, and a new international loan similar to this kind of consortium has no other meaning than to disrupt China and induce China to be under international joint management, which is very clear. The Foreign Ministry may invite the British and American ambassadors to Tokyo in the future to formally explain its China policy. (Nikkan Telegraph, 2nd)</p>

<h3>Japanese Recruit Laborers in Yu to Build Roads Outside the Pass</h3>

It was stated during recruitment that a settlement allowance of 50 yuan and a daily wage of 1.2 yuan would be provided, but not only was the settlement allowance not issued to those who responded to the recruitment and left the pass, but the daily wage, including food expenses, was only 28 cents. The workers could not bear the suffering. Those who tried to escape were captured and beaten to death. However, laborers inside the pass who do not know the truth are still responding to the recruitment every day. The pseudo-Datong Company is affiliated with many traitors who are recruiting in various places in Beiping, Tianjin, and southern Hebei.

<h3>A Perspective on the Recent Two Cases of Bank Employees Stealing Money</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>Recently, cases of bank employees stealing money and embezzling funds have been heard from time to time. First, there was the case of Xu Jianhou of the China General Commercial Bank, and recently, there was the joint fraud case of Hua Zhongchu, Pan Ruilin, Ding Chengfu, Zhu Minggui, and others of the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank. The latter has particularly aroused the attention of the general public. Examining the two cases, the original positions of the money-stealing criminals were the same: counting banknotes. Their motives for fraud were nothing more than money and lust. Blinded by money, they rushed to the door of speculation and gambling. Bewitched by lust, they did not hesitate to spend a fortune to buy smiles and squandered without restraint. As a result, they were all in debt and unable to make amends. They resorted to this last resort, sacrificing their lifelong reputation. Their foolishness is extreme, and one can only sigh in despair. However, after carefully examining the details of the two cases, while the embezzlers violated laws and regulations, the bank's failure to prevent such situations from happening is also a regrettable matter.</p>
<p>What distinguishes China's issuance system from other countries is the prevalence of the banknote requisition system. The banknote requisition system started with the Zhejiang Industrial Bank in the fourth year of the Republic of China (1915). The bank first signed a banknote requisition contract with the Shanghai China Bank on the condition of canceling the right of issuance. After the tenth year of the Republic of China (1921), the money shops also followed suit due to financial panic and tight money. In recent years, general banks and money shops have all regarded banknote requisition as a major side business. As of today, there are ten Chinese banks issuing banknotes, and the amount of issuance is increasing rapidly. The increase in the amount of issuance is indeed related to the banknote requisition system to a considerable extent. Why? Because after the implementation of the abolition of the tael and the conversion to yuan, the small money shops were immediately eliminated. Those that survived relied solely on requisitioning marked banknotes. Their preparation for requisition is different from that of the general public. They pay full cash, and the bank provides a weekly interest of 6% to 7.5% on 40% of the guaranteed reserve. Therefore, a banknote requisition of one million yuan yields a profit of 20,000 to 30,000 yuan per year. Even after deducting various expenses, the surplus is still considerable. As a result, banknote requisition shops are all keen to operate and promote the business. They even use subsidies (ranging from six to more than ten yuan per ten thousand) as an incentive to exchange for banknotes from other banks. This kind of abnormal issuance naturally failed to fully meet the needs of society. As a result, the "return" was extremely rapid, and the banknote counting work between banknotes became increasingly busy. According to the usual practice, the "return" from banknote requisition shops only counts the large amounts on the spot. As far as the issuing bank is concerned, the other banks' banknotes delivered by the banknote requisition shops are sent to the banknote counting room for counting as long as the large amounts are correct. If a shortage is found, a request for replenishment is made to the banknote delivery shop based on the marked number and the cut line, or even an account is recorded on its behalf for future settlement. The reason for the shortage is not investigated. On the contrary, if a banknote shortage occurs due to the "return" from the shop, it is denied unless it is discovered on the spot. This one-sided approach provides an opportunity for unscrupulous individuals to embezzle funds. When this trend became rampant, banknote requisition shops all demanded on-the-spot counting, and those who spent money like dirt resorted to any means. The recent large-scale theft and embezzlement of banknotes originated from this.</p>
<p>Now, the theft and embezzlement of banknotes by Xu, Hua, and others have been successively detected, serving as a warning to those who hear about it. This trend should gradually subside. However, there is still something that I cannot refrain from saying, namely, that today, when the issuance system is still in need of rectification, the shortcomings in the institutional aspect of financial institutions are certainly not limited to the one mentioned above. How to remedy it as soon as possible and make the system increasingly sound to prevent future cases of accidental embezzlement and fraud is a problem that the authorities of both the banking and money industries should pay attention to today. In short, what we hope from the financial community is "knowing people and making good use of them" and "improving the system." Will financiers not consider it a remote and unattainable matter?</p>
<h3>New Interior Vice Minister Tao Lüqian Assumed Office Yesterday</h3>

At 10:00 AM, he had a photograph taken and issued a written statement as follows: Lüqian has been serving in foreign affairs and legislative bodies, and has little experience in domestic administration. He was apprehensive after receiving the appointment, and Premier Wang repeatedly urged him to take office as soon as possible to avoid disruption of ministry affairs. Unable to decline, he arrived at the ministry today. Fortunately, Minister Huang will soon be able to take office, but he is still weak and needs to rest. The affairs under the jurisdiction of this ministry are complex and varied. This ministry is responsible for guiding and supervising local officials in the execution of various domestic affairs. In the future, we should follow the central government's policies and consult with local governments at any time to ensure progress. Internally, civil affairs, statistics, and police affairs are all important. We plan to study them in detail later and formulate plans for any matters that need to be established or reformed and implement them. As for personnel and administration within the ministry, we will consult with Minister Huang for guidance. When reporters asked about personnel changes, Tao said that except for the replacement of the Director of Civil Affairs and various counselors who had resigned, most others would remain unchanged. Furthermore, the Permanent Vice Minister Xu Xiuzhi will also come to Nanjing to take office. (2nd, Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Bans Whole Sheet Plain Cigarette Paper</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Luyu Regional Consolidated Tax Bureau reported to the Ministry of Finance that unscrupulous merchants were transporting whole sheets of plain cigarette paper to the interior for the production of illegally manufactured cigarettes.

The Ministry of Justice's interpretation is as follows: According to Articles 109 and 114 of the Company Law, the issuance of shares by a limited liability company should occur after the conclusion of the incorporation meeting and registration. Article 100 concerns the regulations for convening the incorporation meeting, and the phrase "issuance of unregistered shares" in Paragraph 3 refers to acknowledging that the share certificate states that such shares will be issued in the future. It should not be interpreted as granting the right to issue shares at the time of convening the incorporation meeting. Please refer to this for verification. (2nd, Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Beijing Mayor Shi Ying Denies Plans to Build Trolleybuses</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Beijing Mayor Shi Ying stated that the report that the municipal government plans to build trolleybuses with a capital of 2 million yuan in a joint public-private venture, with Lai Lian in charge of preparations, is completely untrue. This matter was once proposed several years ago and has long been abandoned. The current traffic situation in the city, with two public bus companies and various vehicles powered by manpower, machinery, and animals, is sufficient to meet the demand. In recent years, the lives of rickshaw pullers have become increasingly difficult. Before a solution can be found for a large number of these pullers to change occupations quickly, the city will definitely not further threaten their livelihoods. Therefore, there is absolutely no need or intention to establish trolleybuses. (2nd, Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Hunan Province Re-divides Security Zones</h3>
<p>[Changsha] In order to maintain security, train local militias, and suppress bandits, He Jian, the commander of the security forces of Hunan Province, previously divided the entire province into six zones, with a command headquarters established in each zone. Since its establishment, supervision and command have been more convenient. However, because the previously divided zones were mostly based on the defense areas of the stationed military commanders, the size was uneven. In particular, the fifth and third zones had too many counties under their jurisdiction. Furthermore, due to traffic congestion, organization and command were lacking in flexibility. In order to comprehensively maintain security, the entire province has now been divided into eight zones, with a command headquarters still established in each zone.

<h3>Soviet Government Improves Railway Administration</h3>
<p>Newly Appointed Minister of Transportation</p>
<p>[Moscow] Kaganovich, who built the first underground railway in Moscow, was appointed Minister of Railways today. Observers regard this appointment as a very important move by the Soviet Union. The Russian newspaper Pravda claimed that Kaganovich is one of the most important executive members of the Communist Party and also the closest comrade of Stalin, so his appointment is interpreted as a direct and closer supervision of the railway industry by the Communist Party. The railway is a very important part of the national industry, and the Russians cannot allow it to lag behind for long. Although other industries have advanced in recent years, the railway alone has not progressed and has hindered the progress of other industries. This situation is caused by a lack of organization and discipline. The former managers of the national railway paid too much attention to trivial matters and neglected the main points.

<h3>Siamese King Announces Abdication</h3>
<p>Bangkok The Siamese Public Gazette Bureau received a telegram from London stating that the Siamese King formally announced his abdication today. (2nd, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] The King of Siam had the intention to abdicate because of a conflict with the National Assembly. The Siamese government sent a delegation to England to persuade him to stay. Negotiations have been going on for several months. Later, the King proposed several conditions, which had to be accepted by the National Assembly before he would agree to return to the throne. It is now known that the Siamese National Assembly has rejected the King's demands. This news was learned directly by the King from Bangkok, not conveyed by the Siamese government delegation stationed in England. After receiving the news, the King has decided to announce his abdication. It is said that the abdication edict will be issued soon and is very brief, with two reasons given. (1) The King believes that those suspected of opposing the government should not be secretly tried by a special committee and then exiled or executed, but should be handed over to the ordinary courts for legal judgment. This has been rejected by the National Assembly. (2) The Constitution stipulates that half of the members of the National Assembly should be appointed by the government, but the National Assembly opposes this. Due to the above two conflicts with the National Assembly, the King decided to abdicate to apologize to the people of the country. It is said that the King will remain in England until June this year, or may go to Switzerland. However, he will not reside in England for a long time. (1st, Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese-Dutch Maritime Conference</h3>

<h3>Hitler Delivers Speech on Peace Celebrating the Recovery of Native Soil</h3>
<p>The Saar Problem Resolved: An Element of European Peace</p>
<p>Hoping for Increased Franco-German Friendship and the Removal of Thorns</p>
<p>Saarbrücken - German Führer Hitler received military honors at the city hall this afternoon. After the review was completed, the celebration of gratitude began. The square in front of the city hall was packed with people, making it almost impossible to breathe. Police had to block all roads leading into the square. The first speaker was Deputy Führer Hess, who said that with the return of the Saar people to Germany, Germany has restored its honor and is once again respected by the world. This plebiscite is more important for European peace than initially thought. Next, Propaganda Minister Goebbels spoke, saying that Germany is no longer a republic governed by profiteers, but a nation of honor. Then, the new Saar Administrative Chief, Bürckel, spoke, dispelling the fears of Saar religious believers that the authorities might interfere in church affairs, saying that the National Socialist Party has fully relinquished its own rights to the church, but these rights must not hinder National Socialism. Finally, Hitler stood up, and a deafening cheer erupted, lasting for several minutes. Hitler's speech stated, in brief, that he was extremely pleased to be with the Saar people during the first hour of their restored freedom. This is a day of joy for all of Germany, and he believes it is also a day of joy for all of Europe, as this matter can eliminate the greatest dangers that have afflicted the two major nations (France and Germany). We sincerely hope that our great neighbor is also prepared to join us in seeking peace. The two major nations must now be able to work together to remove all thorns from the path to peace. Those in power should now know that one nation can never tear another nation to pieces. Kindness is more powerful than any document. Today we celebrate together; tomorrow we will jointly manage Greater Germany. You should be honored to be invited to cooperate with us. The speeches of all the speakers were broadcast nationwide by radio. It is estimated that there are hundreds of thousands of Germans in this area who are armed or have been trained by the government. (1st, Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>Saarbrücken - Führer Hitler delivered a speech to a large crowd today, celebrating the Saar's recovery of its native soil, hoping for the progress of European peace and understanding, and the increase of Franco-German friendship. Hitler recognized that the resolution of the Saar problem is a major factor in the peace of the European continent. Hitler said, "I believe that after the plebiscite, Franco-German relations will have a significant improvement. Our neighbor (referring to France) hopes for peace, and shares the same enthusiasm as we do. Today is not only a day of happiness for Germany, but also a time of joy for Europe." Hitler solemnly affirmed the fairness of the public's evaluation of the voting and recognized that the Saar was originally German territory. Hitler's speech lasted from 7:25 PM to 8:00 PM. Following him, Propaganda Minister Goebbels, Hitler's right-hand man, gave a brief speech, the content of which was roughly the same as Hitler's. (1st, National News Agency)</p>
<h3>Papen Resigns as Ambassador to Austria, It is Said</h3>
<p>Vienna - German Ambassador to Austria Papen departed for his home country a few days ago, and there are rumors that he has resigned. The "Daily News" commented on this matter, saying, "If the rumor of Papen's resignation is confirmed, it would be because the German government is extremely dissatisfied with Austria's support for French peace policies and believes that the Austrian cabinet's consultation with Britain and France is Papen's fault. This shows that German extremists are once again gaining the upper hand, and their policy of aggression towards Austria will surely make a comeback." (1st, Havas Telegraph)</p>
<h3>French Chamber of Deputies Passes Bill Granting Women's Suffrage</h3>
<p>[Paris] The Chamber of Deputies discussed the issue of women's suffrage today. The Socialist Party introduced a bill advocating that women should have the right to vote and be elected to various legislative bodies, so that universal suffrage can be fully realized. As a result, it passed by a vote of 453 to 124. The effect of this vote is not yet certain, as the Chamber of Deputies' approval must still be ratified by the Senate, which has always opposed women's right to be elected and believes that the right to vote and the right to be elected should be discussed separately. Therefore, the Senate may propose another amendment and submit it to the joint committee of the two houses on universal suffrage for review, which is also possible. However, there is no doubt that women's right to vote in municipal elections will ultimately be passed. (1st, Havas Telegraph)</p>

<h3>Greek Revolution a Flash in the Pan</h3>
<p>A Section of the Army and Navy Suddenly Launches a Rebellion</p>
<p>Government Forces Obey Orders, and the Rebellion is Quickly Suppressed</p>
<p>Athens - Several army officers occupied the Salamis arsenal in an attempt to rebel, but they have been suppressed by the government. The rebels have already surrendered, and order in the capital and other provinces is good. Prime Minister Tsaldaris recently issued a statement saying that a small number of troublemakers attempted to undermine the people's freedom, but they have been crushed by government forces. According to information obtained by our reporter, the rebels had been preparing to revolt for a long time. The original plan was to have troops stationed in Athens and other places launch the rebellion at the same time. Last night, several rebel officers implemented the original plan and attacked and occupied the Salamis arsenal. Unexpectedly, the Athens garrison was not incited, and the situation did not escalate. Government troops and rebels exchanged fire until late at night. The rebels were unable to hold out and eventually surrendered. Military locations and government offices in the capital are all guarded by troops. At present, the rebel movement in the army has completely failed. In the navy, two destroyers have surrendered, and a submarine that had joined the rebels is also surrendering to the government. There were rumors of a rebellion in the province of Salonica, but this has been officially denied by officials. (2nd, Havas Telegraph)</p>
<p>Athens - A mutiny occurred at the Salamis Arsenal tonight, aiming to restore General Plastiras, who is currently in exile abroad. If the Greek government had not suppressed it with lightning speed, it would have caused a new revolution. Supporters of Plastiras, led by officers stationed at Salamis, apparently intended to seize the arsenal and use the weapons to supply those who oppose the government. Martial law was declared here this morning. At the same time, the government issued a statement saying that it was capable of controlling the overall situation. However, by this afternoon, rumors spread that the fleet had fallen into the hands of the rebels and that five warships were trying to escape by night. The government was aware of this and immediately issued a radio warning to them, saying that if they tried to escape, they would be regarded as pirates. According to a certain newspaper, Italian warships in nearby waters have telegraphed their government for instructions. This afternoon, a large number of reinforcements arrived from various provinces, all spirited and singing all the way as they marched through the streets of Athens. The reinforcements arrived just in time, as the authorities received a report that a large detachment of the Republican Guard was responding to the rebels just as they were stationed in a new camp. The authorities immediately dispatched a large army to attack the rebels. After a fierce battle, the rebels were exhausted and surrendered. Artillery was used during the battle. Afterwards, the government issued another notice to reassure the people, stating that a few madmen had rebelled against the legitimate government of the country, but thanks to the loyal and courageous service of the troops, the rebellious and patriotic rebellion had been quelled. The government is now in complete control of the overall situation. A Reuters reporter interviewed the Greek Army Chief, who said that the government had sent aircraft to bomb warships that were assisting the rebels. The cruiser Averoff was hit and damaged. Now, except for a small battle in Athens, the entire land is loyal to the government. The Army Chief also said that the government troops suffered few casualties, and about ten rebels were killed. It is the intention of the people here that the Averoff is now trying to communicate with the island of Crete. The Greek government is now investigating whether the ship has this intention, because this move has great political significance. It is said that the cruiser Hilli and three destroyers are also in line with the Averoff. The planes that bombed the rebel ships have all returned to the capital. All the planes showed signs of having been in battle. (2nd, Reuters Telegraph)</p>

<h3>Analysis of the Italian-Ethiopian Conflict</h3>
<p>— (Italian Correspondence)</p>
<p>The Radical Advancement of Italy's Southern Policy</p>
<p>Mediterranean Disputes Extend to East Africa</p>
<p>Italy is considered one of the world's major powers, but it lacks iron ore, coal, oil, cotton, and wool. In short, it lacks all natural resources. Other countries, such as England and France, have relatively abundant iron and coal mines. Germany still has a large coal-producing area. Therefore, Italy has no choice but to seek natural resources overseas to compensate for its domestic deficiencies. However, the Mediterranean coast—the nourishing ground of the European powers—and Africa have been divided up by England and France. Italy only has a barren piece of land in Libya. After the European war, England was entrusted with governing an area of 989,000 square miles with a population of 9,330,000, and France was entrusted with governing an area of 253,000 square miles with a population of 6,470,000. Italy obtained very little. Later, England's diplomatic measures were very clever and expressed concessions to Italy. In 1924, it ceded the area near the Jubba River in Italian Somaliland in East Africa to Italy. In 1925, it also sacrificed a piece of Egyptian land and ceded the Yarabu area to it. Therefore, there are no major rifts between England and Italy. France has always been unwilling to make concessions easily, and local disharmony still occurs from time to time in North Africa, causing minor disputes. At the end of last year, after the relations between Germany and France became very dangerous, France feared that Italy would continue to advocate the abrogation of the Treaty of Versailles, which would indirectly help Germany. Therefore, it decided to unite with Italy's diplomatic policy, which led to the Rome Accord of January 7th this year.</p>
<p>One month before the establishment of the Rome Accord—on December 5, 1934—the armies of the two countries, Italian Somaliland and Abyssinia, bordering on each other, had an armed conflict. This conflict, on the surface, was not of great significance. Both sides only lost one hundred thirty-odd soldiers and a number of wounded. Especially in Africa, it is not considered a major event. However, Africa now has only one independent country, Abyssinia, and it is closely connected to the colonies of England and France. The occurrence of this conflict was due to the joint survey committee of the British and Abyssinian boundary demarcation entering the undecided area of dispute between Italy and Abyssinia, which triggered this incident.</p>
<p>According to the Italian government, the initial attack was on the surveying team and never crossed the Abyssinian border, and there was no reason to cross the border. However, the Abyssinian garrison was equipped with machine guns and artillery, and maliciously mocked the Italian army. One person also raised his hand as a signal to provoke the Italian army. The Italian army originally had no intention of starting a war, so after reinforcements arrived and the Abyssinian army was defeated, the Italian army did not pursue them. Therefore, Italy made the following demands on Abyssinia: first, the Abyssinian government must formally apologize; second, it must compensate for the losses.</p>
<p>The Abyssinian version is just the opposite. It said that the Italian army invaded 75 miles into Abyssinian territory. In the Walal area of Abyssinia, armored vehicles, artillery, and airplanes were lined up, and the Abyssinian army was attacked without reason. One hundred and fifty Abyssinian soldiers were killed in action. The offensive was not launched by the Abyssinian army, but by the Italian army. Moreover, the Italian army planes dropped two bombs on the Abyssinian army as a signal, followed by the opening of machine guns and tanks charging towards the Abyssinian army. At that time, the Abyssinian army only had the minimum amount of self-defense and did not open machine guns or artillery to counterattack. Afterwards, Abyssinia brought the matter to the League of Nations and requested the League of Nations to make a judgment. It is not yet clear how the League of Nations will deal with this matter.</p>
<p>Why does Italy want to expand its influence in Abyssinia? It is for its lack of resources and trade markets. Whether from a geographical, historical, or present international relations perspective, especially in Africa, there is room for development, and the only place with a considerable connection with Italy is Abyssinia.</p>
<p>Abyssinia is a mountainous country in Africa, with an area of about 350,000 square miles and a population of about 10 million. It is considered a sparsely populated area in Africa. Its railway, from Djibouti to Addis Ababa, totaling 487 miles, was built with French capital (after the Rome Accord was established, it will be jointly managed with Italy). This is an entirely undeveloped land and an excellent market for the export of Italian products. At the same time, Abyssinia's animal husbandry is quite developed, which can supply wool, and agriculture is gradually improving, which can supply cotton. Other items such as animal hides, coffee, wax, cream, and ivory are all the things that Italy currently needs most. Furthermore, the metal minerals that Italy lacks—iron, copper, placer gold, coal, etc.—even if there are no specific discoveries at the moment, it is very promising based on the local geological conditions. Moreover, in 1883, Italy signed a treaty of friendship with Abyssinia, and Abyssinia was a protectorate of Italy. In 1896, the Italian army suffered a defeat, and the protectorate was abolished. Now that Italy has become a modern country, it wants to take the opportunity to revive its past historical relations. However, the Abyssinian people are good at fighting, and it is feared that they will not readily submit. (January 31st, Rome)</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Wuchang Headquarters</h3>
<p>Chiang's Admonitory Speech to All Staff</p>
<p>Personnel Choices for Various Department Heads Announced</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: To facilitate Commander Chiang of the Military Commission's command over the suppression of remnant bandits in various provinces, a headquarters has been specially established in Wuchang, with Zhang Xueliang as the Director in charge of all matters. The original Headquarters for the Suppression of Bandits in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui will be abolished simultaneously, so that authority can be unified. After receiving the order, Zhang Xueliang is simultaneously concluding affairs at the headquarters and preparing the new headquarters. As of February 28, the headquarters concluded its affairs. On March 1, the new headquarters was officially established. At 8:00 AM that morning, Director Zhang Xueliang and other staff members of the headquarters arrived at the headquarters. At 9:00 AM, Commander Chiang crossed the river from Hankou by special steamer and landed at the Pinghumen Wharf in Wuchang, proceeding directly to the headquarters. The military band played music in welcome, which was very enthusiastic. Guests attending were limited to Pacification Commissioner He Chengjun, Provincial Chairman Zhang Qun, former Chairman Xia Douyin, and a few others. At 10:00 AM, the establishment ceremony of the headquarters was held in the grand hall, with Commander Chiang presiding. After the ceremony, he delivered an admonitory speech, saying, "Zhongzheng believes that in order to implement the Three Principles of the People advocated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, to revitalize the nation and save the country, the initial methods and most urgent tasks are none other than educating the people and governing the army. The future work of the headquarters should, on the one hand, intensify the suppression of remnant bandits, ensuring that they are annihilated within a limited time to eliminate this huge disaster for the country and the nation; on the other hand, it should pay attention to reforming society, boosting morale, and establishing a foundation for national rejuvenation. With this goal in mind, what Zhongzheng sees as urgent and is willing to promote with all his strength is, on the negative side, the suppression of opium; and on the positive side, the promotion of the New Life Movement. Regarding opium suppression, the six-year plan previously set by the headquarters is indeed an effective method for completely eradicating it. In the past year, the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui have made progress in banning cultivation. The provinces of Jiangxi and Zhejiang have completely eradicated opium seedlings in their entire territories, with particularly notable results. And the investigation of opium users and registration of opium addicts in Jiangsu Province have also been effectively carried out. In the future, we should continue to implement the original plan thoroughly, aiming to extend the existing achievements to all provinces and further achieve the goal of completely banning the trafficking, manufacturing, and consumption of opium. Time flies, and one year has already passed of the six-year deadline. This cannot but be expected from all comrades, public and private parties, and enlightened people across the country, to work together to assist. Since the New Life Movement was initiated by the Nanchang Headquarters last year, it has relied on the concerted efforts of various regions to deeply instill the concepts of this movement into people's hearts. The creation of a new national life will truly begin with this. In the future, comrades at the headquarters, in handling affairs, in addition to realizing the three principles of militarization, productionalization, and arts-ification stipulated in the New Life Movement's outline, should also pay attention to the promotion of labor and service. Zhongzheng believes that life only has true meaning when it is based on labor and aimed at service. In particular, everyone must be able to labor based on the concept of serving the country and society, so as to sweep away the past bad habits of laxity and disorganization in our nation and establish a strong and united atmosphere to save our country from its current poverty and difficulties. Educating the people through labor has shown remarkable results in the past, and benefiting others at one's own expense should become the fashion. The great cause of national rejuvenation must be based on the promotion of the New Life Movement and the popularization of labor and service. This is what I especially hope all comrades will do by setting an example and leading the compatriots across the country to do their part and rise up together to assist in achieving it. As for developing highway transportation, organizing the masses, and popularizing education, these have been the basic policies of bandit suppression since the establishment of the Nanchang Headquarters. All the work that has been devoted to but not yet completed in the past should continue to be implemented, and its meaning should be further enriched. In the past, the purpose of developing transportation was to facilitate bandit suppression; in the future, it should be to develop culture. In the past, the goal was to improve national knowledge and promote the popularization of mass education; in the future, education should be linked to various facilities in addition to being popularized, in order to complete the mission of educating the people and saving the country. The revolutionary cause is vast and significant, but the way to start should focus on the essentials. I hereby reveal the essentials and admonish my comrades to strive together." After the speech, the meeting adjourned. Commander Chiang immediately issued a handwritten decree appointing the key personnel, including Headquarters Director Zhang Xueliang, Chief of Staff Qian Dajun, Secretary-General Yang Yongtai, Director of the First Department Yan Xunfu, Deputy Director Liu Shoupeng, and Staff Officer; Director of the Second Department Xiong Zhongtao, Deputy Director Min Xiangfan, and Chief Manager; Director of the Third Department Mi Chunlin, Deputy Director Ma Zhaoqi, and Chief of General Affairs; Director of the Fourth Department Wu Jiaxiang (Deputy Director not yet appointed), and Chief Secretary; Director of the Fifth Department Gan Naiguang, Deputy Director Zhou Congzheng, and Chief of Party Affairs; Director of the Sixth Department Chen Zhenxian, Deputy Director Wen Qun, and Chief of Rural Relief; Director of the Seventh Department concurrently held by Yang Yongtai, Deputy Director Huang Weicai, and Chief of Finance, Audit, and Opium Suppression. Departments One, Two, and Three are under the control of the Chief of Staff; Departments Four, Five, Six, and Seven are under the control of the Secretary-General. In addition, Director of the Transportation Department Lin Xiang, Director of the Army Reorganization Department Chen Cheng, Director of the Political Training Department He Zhonghan, and Director of the Military Law Department Chen Enpu were also announced. However, the personnel choices for the Directors of the Transportation and Medical Departments have not yet been determined, possibly belonging to Yu Feipeng and Liu Ruiheng. The Headquarters Director is a General, the Directors of Departments One through Seven are Major Generals, and the Directors of the Transportation and other departments are Lieutenant Generals. After Chiang appointed the key personnel, he also summoned them individually, admonishing them with great care. At 12:00 PM, he crossed the river and returned to Hankou. At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, the various departments of the headquarters began to work, issuing the following telegram: "To the various Yuan, Bu, Hui in Nanjing, Military Commission, Pacification Commissioners of various provinces, governments of various provinces, municipal governments, general commanders, corps commanders, division commanders, and independent brigade commanders: The Wuchang Headquarters was established in Wuchang on March 1 and has begun to work. This is a special telegram for your information. Military Commission Chairman's Headquarters, East 未印," (March 1)</p>
<h3>Bandit Troubles in Western Shanxi and Northern Shaanxi</h3>
<p>The Peiping Military Council Sends Personnel for Inspection</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: The spread of Communist bandits in northern Shaanxi has been going on for a long time. The original troops in the area, in addition to the entire division of 囗囗囗, also transferred the 囗囗囗 unit stationed in Luoyang to assist in the suppression, hoping to eliminate them as soon as possible to avoid future troubles. However, transportation in the area is obstructed, and the bandit gangs rely on natural dangers. Sometimes they gather into groups, and sometimes they disperse into smaller units. Therefore, although the two divisions of 囗囗囗 and the various troops sent by Shaanxi Province have been encircling and suppressing them for half a year, it is still difficult to eradicate their roots. Moreover, the bandits in northern Shaanxi have not yet been eliminated, and bandit traces have appeared in western Shanxi. The robbery in Kelan in northern Shanxi last winter was indeed secretly connected with the bandits in Shaanxi. After strict precautions by the Shanxi army, it was quickly quelled. Yan Xishan, the Pacification Commissioner of Taiyuan, attaches great importance to this. In addition to appointing Yang Yaofang, the commander of the 71st Division, as the Garrison Commander of western Shanxi, overseeing his troops to be responsible for the defense of the various counties along the river in western Shanxi, and strictly blocking and suppressing them, he also instructed the Pacification Office and the Provincial Government to be particularly careful in selecting and dispatching military and political personnel to those counties, and to pay close attention to the bandit situation at any time. In order to understand the actual situation of the bandit areas in northern Shaanxi and western Shanxi, He Yingqin, the acting chairman of the Peiping Military Council, recently specially sent Mao Xuzhai, Yang Zhen, and staff member Bi Chongzhi to Taiyuan to inspect the areas in western Shanxi and northern Shaanxi. Mao and others arrived in Taiyuan three or four days ago and have repeatedly consulted with Jia Jingde, the secretary-general of the Pacification Office, Zhu Shouguang, the chief of staff, Xu Yongchang, the chairman of the Provincial Government, Liu Shaoting, the representative of Jing Yuexiu stationed in Taiyuan, and the authorities of the Military Reorganization Committee, and decided to go to Fenyang on the morning of the 26th and then to the counties of Qingjian and Yulin in northern Shaanxi for inspection. According to Mao, the trip is expected to take about two months. If time permits, he also plans to give separate talks to the stationed troops, instructing them on the strategy of bandit suppression.

<h3>Re-discussion of the War Zone Issue at the Tianjin Meeting</h3>
<p>Talks Between Takahashi and Yin Rugeng</p>
<p>Replacement of the Security Team Not Yet Scheduled</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Regarding the war zone issue, the Chinese and Japanese sides previously met in Tianjin and Peiping to discuss and decide on the new Eastward deployment of the newly formed security team and the reorganization of the Yutian team. However, the implementation procedures were delayed because the Japanese side considered it necessary to ask for instructions from the Kwantung Army. Therefore, on February 17, Yi Wo specially went to Changchun to report to General Nami, the commander of the Kwantung Army. He returned to Yu on the 23rd and immediately telegraphed Takahashi, the military attache of the Peiping Embassy, to convey the message to Yin Tong and Yin Rugeng. The Yins believed that the Tianjin Japanese Garrison Headquarters and the Japanese Consulate General were involved in resolving various issues and that it was necessary to negotiate with them on the proposals. Also, because Yi Wo had a message to meet with Meijin in Tianjin, the Yins arrived in Tianjin by train on the evening of the 24th. Before departing, they invited Takahashi to Tianjin to hold joint talks. Takahashi arrived in Tianjin by train on the evening of the 25th. Because Tao Shangming was unable to arrive in time, only the two Yins visited Takahashi at the Tokiwa Ryokan in the Japanese Concession on the morning of the 26th to consult on the matter first. At noon, Takahashi hosted a casual meal for the two Yins at the Ryokan. In the afternoon, Takahashi and Yin Rugeng went to the Japanese barracks in Haiguang Temple to visit Sakai, the chief of staff of the Japanese army, and senior staff members Oki, Dosakabe, and Kawaguchi to exchange views. They then went to the Japanese Consulate General to visit Vice Consul Tanaka. That evening, Yin Tong and Yin Rugeng hosted a banquet for Takahashi, Kawaguchi, Oki, Dosakabe, and Tanaka at the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau's reception office on Route 33 in the French Concession. During the banquet, they discussed the matter again. Originally, they intended to discuss it thoroughly after Yi Wo arrived, but it was postponed until the 27th. Tao Shangming arrived in Tianjin early in the morning, and Yi Wo also telegraphed that he was unable to come due to business. Therefore, the Yins and Takahashi seriously negotiated at the Tokiwa Ryokan and concluded in the afternoon. According to the new proposal by the Japanese side, the discipline of the newly formed war zone security team before entering for replacement is unknown. In order to avoid unrest in the war zone, it was proposed to first send a small part to be stationed in the Luan-Yu Administrative Region. After a considerable period of time, if the new security team proves to be reliable, the rest will be sent in gradually. The transfer of the Yutian Security Supplementary Team must be stationed near the Peiping-Liaoning Railway line and must be stationed in one place. The Japanese side explained that the discipline of the team is not good. If they are stationed in locations outside the railway, it will be difficult to prevent and suppress accidents. Therefore, the new defense area should be near the railway line. The Japanese side's proposal clearly deviates from the previously agreed principles, so no decision was made. Another meeting is planned for the 28th. As for setting up a Security Commander, the War Zone Cleanup Committee made the request based on the Japanese side's requirements in order to facilitate the management of the war zone security team, not to be directly under the provincial government, but to be under the jurisdiction of the Committee. A Security Committee will be established within the Committee, and Zhu Shiqin will be responsible as the responsible member. There will be no Security Commander. Today, Takahashi told visitors after the meeting that the negotiations on various issues in the war zone today have made considerable progress and will be implemented step by step soon. The return of Ma Lan Yu and the Eastern Tombs has been decided in the short term. Currently, the exact date of return has not been determined because minor issues have not been resolved. (27th)</p>

<h3>Record of an Inspection in the Northwest</h3>
<p>— By Special Correspondent Geng Ya</p>
<p>An Overview of the Recent Turmoil in Xinjiang (4)</p>
<p>Ma Zhongying's second entry into Xinjiang took place between late April and early May of the 22nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1933]. Ma's forces mobilized over 7,000 men in successive waves, creating an even more imposing presence than before. This occurred shortly after the April 12th Incident [i.e., Chiang Kai-shek's Shanghai massacre], when the new provincial government of Xinjiang was struggling to manage a multitude of affairs. Adding to the chaos, uprisings were erupting everywhere and Hami was undefended, allowing Ma to advance deep into Xinjiang and directly threaten Hami. In June, Ma successively captured Mulih River, Guchengzi (Qitai), and other locations, seized firearms from Fuyuan, and advanced westward. Sheng Shicai, the border defense commissioner of the new Xinjiang provincial government, personally led a large army eastward on May 26th to intercept them. However, he only reached Santai when he learned of the fall of Gu[chengzi], Fu[yuan], and other places. Furthermore, Ma's brother, Zhongjie, had already advanced on the provincial capital. Sheng then shifted from defense to offense, engaging Ma's main force in fierce combat at Ziniquan on June 7th. The fighting was intense, resulting in casualties on both sides (estimated at around 2,000). Meanwhile, the Tungan [Hui] commander He Janiyas and others, along with Mamuti and his troops, defected from Ma's side and attacked him in support of the new government. Ma was subsequently defeated in what became known as the Battle of Ziniquan. According to provincial sources, He Janiyas and Mamuti broke with Ma because, firstly, Ma Zhongying harbored wild ambitions to seize Xinjiang and sever ties with the Republic of China, while He Janiyas aimed to improve the political system and secure freedom and equality under Chinese law for all ethnic groups. Secondly, Ma Zhongying was a rootless ambitious outsider whose forces were merely a motley collection of bandits willing to gamble everything, harming people of all ethnicities. In contrast, He Janiyas was a respected local leader whose troops were all local residents, and who gradually disapproved of Ma's actions, leading to a change in strategy. Furthermore, they witnessed the establishment of the new government, which appointed Manchuk Zhabu as a division commander and Xilike Bandi Aylin, Han Dabiya, Ololo Zhabu Noyintai, and others as brigade commanders, demonstrating equal participation in military and political power for all ethnic groups. The provincial authorities also explained to He and others that the new government's overthrow of Jin [Shuren, the former governor] and the initial alliance between the Tungan people and Ma Zhongying in hopes of reforming Xinjiang's administration had been a shared aspiration. Now that Jin had been overthrown and their wish fulfilled, they should cooperate with the new government. Although He and others had initially declared a "ten-year war," they ultimately had no specific objective. Therefore, they reversed course and cooperated with the provincial army. (He had previously surrendered to the provincial army once before Jin's downfall, and there was another instance of wavering in southern Xinjiang after the Ziniquan cooperation). Sheng then appointed He Janiyas as commander of the South Xinjiang Defense Command and Mamuti as a division commander, ordering them to march to southern Xinjiang to suppress the Tungan uprisings in various counties.</p>
<p>In the Battle of Ziniquan, Ma's forces suffered heavy casualties and lost over 1,000 firearms. They scattered in disarray, leading their remaining troops to flee through mountain passes and take refuge in Shanshan and Turpan. After Sheng's army recaptured Fuyuan, Gucheng, and Mulih River, they intended to pursue the retreating forces. However, they suddenly received news that a so-called "second coup" (the April 12th Incident being the first) was about to erupt in the provincial capital, with the target being the overthrow of Sheng. As a result, Sheng abandoned the pursuit and rushed back to the province under cover of night. Using a meeting as a pretext, he invited the masterminds Tao Mingyue, Li Xiaotian, and Chen Zhong to the provincial government garden and executed them by firing squad. (This time, the commander of the Altai Garrison, Ba Pinggutai, was involved, and he was betrayed by his subordinate Beketef, who informed on him. Ba was also arrested, and Beketef has since been promoted to the position of Commander-in-Chief for Bandit Suppression in Southern Xinjiang.)</p>
<p>Earlier, in the spring of the 22nd year [1933], the Turpan Incident occurred, with Ma Zhongying instigating Ma Shiming to occupy Turpan and Shanshan. At that time, the Southern Mountain leaders Ma Quanlu and Ma Dexiang were at odds with each other. Ma Dexiang eliminated Ma Quanlu and surrendered to the new provincial government. Sheng Shicai appointed him as a division commander. Ma Shiming, resenting Ma Dexiang's surrender, eliminated Ma Dexiang as well. Consequently, the Tungan and Hui forces in the Southern Mountains all came under Ma Shiming's control. During Ma Zhongying's second entry into Xinjiang, he arrived in Turpan and Shanshan and dispatched his deputy division commander Ma Heiying to the Southern Mountains to assist Ma Shiming. In July, Ma Heiying led over 4,000 troops to invade the provincial capital from the Ulabaiyin south and Taiping Canal areas. After Sheng's army launched a two-pronged attack, Ma's forces were defeated and fled to the Toksun area in the south. Having suffered repeated defeats, Ma Zhongying sought a period of rest and reorganization. He requested to surrender to Sheng. Sheng, also having other concerns, made concessions and appointed Ma as the East Road Garrison Commander, designating Hami's Zhenxi as the garrison area. The new provincial government agreed to provide all salaries, supplies, and uniforms according to regulations. Ma dispatched representatives to the province to negotiate while remaining in Turpan, actively making preparations. In September, he secretly sent Ma Heiying to the Ashan area to incite the Hui people to create disturbances in Tacheng and invade Emin, Suilai, and Hutubi counties as the West Road force. He also ordered Brigade Commander Ma, nicknamed "Black Han," to lead several thousand infantry from Daban City to occupy Jijicao as the South Road force. Ma Zhongying himself led his core elite cavalry brigade from Daban City to Shiyaozi, secretly crossed the Tianshan Mountains, and launched a surprise attack on Fuyuan as the East Road force. At that time, Zhang Peiyuan, the Yili Reclamation Commissioner, although appointed as a provincial committee member, division commander, and border defense assistant by the new provincial government after the April 12th Incident at the recommendation of the new provincial government to the central government, his loyalty to the new provincial government was questionable. Therefore, Ma also contacted Zhang in an attempt to coordinate an attack from all directions and encircle Dihua [Ürümqi], vowing to take Dihua as a base for sweeping across Xinjiang.</p>
<p>As reports of the impending crisis poured in, the provincial government, sensing the dire situation, first dispatched a crack force (said to be the Ashan Garrison) to reinforce Tacheng overnight. When the reinforcements arrived, the siege of Tacheng was lifted. Ma's deputy division commander Ma Heiying, commanding Li Fuxing and others, then fled through the Emin, Suilai, and Hutubi areas to harass Dihua. They clashed with Sheng's army, engaging in fierce battles for several days and nights. Li Fuxing was killed in action in Hutubi, and Ma Heiying was later wounded and died in Queergou. The West Road force was thus defeated. The South Road force was intercepted by Sheng's main force, cutting off their connection. Subsequently, a major battle took place in Daban City, resulting in a slight victory. Sheng's army then returned to reinforce the provincial defenses. Upon hearing of the defeats of the southwest forces, Ma did not lose heart. He sent representatives to Dihua to continue peace talks, while secretly mobilizing elite troops to launch a surprise attack on Fuyuan according to the original plan. While Dihua was the foundation of the new province, and Gucheng was an important town to the east, Fuyuan, although a small city, was situated between Dihua and Gucheng, making it a crucial point on the eastern front in the Dihua area. Capturing Fuyuan would easily lead to the fall of Gucheng, making it easier to take the provincial capital. Contrary to expectations, despite Fuyuan having been occupied by Ma once before, the officials and residents this time put up an extremely fierce defense. Ma besieged the city for nine days and eight nights, but ultimately failed to break through. (The defensive methods were innovative, and women and children worked hard, making it worthy of description. I will elaborate later.) Ma's forces suffered heavy casualties, but they continued to persevere in a final struggle, which can be described as stubborn.</p>
<p>Zhang Peiyuan, the Yili Reclamation Commissioner, had long been dissatisfied with the new government's policies. Having recently made contact with Ma, he began to act in opposition to it. Sheng sent Chen Deli (now the head of the Xinjiang Provincial Finance Department and concurrently the head of the Foreign Affairs Department), Guanglu (a Xibe, now the consul-general in Tashkent), and Zhao Shipeng (now the administrative chief of Tacheng) to procure materials, but they were all intercepted by Zhang's forces. Zhang, under the title of Commander-in-Chief of the North Xinjiang, denounced Sheng Shicai. In early December, he dispatched Brigade Commanders Yang Zhenzhong and Liang Zhihong, separately, to Tacheng and Usu to then merge at Suilai and advance westwards, to link up with Ma Zhongying's forces and threaten Dihua. Sheng's army also dispatched a portion of its forces westward, encountering Yang's forces in Wula Usu, part of the Suilai region. The two sides were locked in stalemate, with no clear victor. Yang and others suddenly received an urgent telegram from Zhang, ordering them to immediately return. Upon reaching Anjihai (six stations from Yili), Zhang had already committed suicide. After dispatching Yang and others, Zhang had only left a thousand men to guard Yili. At that time, the Altai and Tacheng Garrison units of Sheng's army, specially trained from among the local people, about two combined brigades of elite troops and equipment, under the command of a certain administrative chief of Tacheng, took advantage of Zhang's weakened rear defenses and launched a direct assault on Yili. They fiercely attacked Zhang's forces for three days and nights. Zhang, seeing that his position was untenable, committed suicide about sixty li outside the city. After his death, a will was found by the pursuing troops (the text of which roughly stated, "One mistake was trusting Minister Luo's visit to Yili, who claimed that he would provide substantial support. Another mistake was Yang Zhenzhong launching his attack too early and retreating too late. The enemy's artillery has been bombarding Yili for too long, and I feel deeply guilty. The merchants previously lent funds for military supplies, which should be repaid with my estate. My elderly mother is still alive, please dress her in mourning clothes when I am coffined," etc. However, there are also claims that Zhang's death was actually a murder, and that the will was forged.) After their victory in Yili, the Garrison troops boarded vehicles and advanced eastward. In the five counties they passed through—Usu, Shawan, Suilai, Hutubi, and Changji—the Garrison troops, unfamiliar with the local conditions and anxious to provide reinforcements due to the tight provincial defenses, failed to attend to everything, causing considerable disturbances along the way. At that time, Ma Zhongying, the Commander-in-Chief of South Xinjiang, who was corresponding with Zhang Peiyuan from afar, had mobilized over 10,000 troops and was besieging Dihua for a month.</p>
<p>During Ma's last siege of Dihua, he relied on the disturbances caused by Ma Heiying in the north, the response from Zhang Peiyuan in the south, and the successive additions of mutinous troops from Sheng's army (mostly former loyalists of Jin Shuren), making his power formidable. However, the vast expanse of Xinjiang and the inconvenient transportation greatly impacted military operations. Ma had already contacted the provincial government to surrender after his initial defeat, but Zhang's joint telegram denouncing Sheng arrived belatedly. Ma was also unaware of Ma Heiying's failure. Zhang Peiyuan's suicide was even further unknown to him. Therefore, he independently launched a large-scale siege of Dihua, which lasted for a month. The city faced shortages of food, and the crisis worsened daily. However, Sheng's army remained confident, shrinking the defensive perimeter to just over 20 li, adopting a strategy of "waiting for the enemy to tire," defending without attacking. On the dawn of December 17th, Ma's forces managed to breach the defense line from Nanliang in the south, but were quickly repelled. Later, hearing that the Altai Garrison reinforcements, loyal to Sheng, were approaching to launch a pincer attack, Ma gathered a large force to intercept them at Toutun River, 70 li west of the city, engaging the Garrison troops in a desperate battle. Ma led the remaining 4,000 to 5,000 troops in a chaotic retreat, fleeing towards southern Xinjiang.</p>
<p>After relieving the siege of Dihua, a portion of the Altai Garrison troops happily returned north by vehicles, while another portion, along with Commander Song's Rescue Army, pursued Ma's forces. Fierce battles erupted along the way. When encountering large cities or dangerous terrain, Ma would often defend and resist stubbornly. At Hala Gorge, between Yanqi and Turpan, the gorge was 30 li long and naturally treacherous. The pursuing troops used airplanes to drop bombs to break through. Meanwhile, He Janiyas's forces, ordered to intercept Ma's troops in the Kucha area, had their weapons seized by Ma's forces, reviving Ma's military strength. Later, after suffering successive blows, they retreated past Aksu and reached Shache. Out of desperation, Ma transferred the remaining command of his troops entirely to Yang Zhenzhong and Li Hairu, and lightly equipped, fled to the Soviet Union via Kashgar. Sheng repeatedly requested extradition, but the Soviet Union refused. After Ma's departure, Yang Zhenzhong, Li Hairu, and others led the remaining forces into Yutian. Yang and Li were former subordinates of Jin Shuren and had been under Sheng's command. Li surrendered to Ma when Gucheng fell, and Yang retreated south with Ma after Zhang Peiyuan's defeat. Ma gained significant assistance from Yang and Li. Before leaving, he had allegedly entrusted them to act as the acting commander and deputy commander of the 36th Division. At the end of the 23rd year [1934], the Dunhuang County government in Gansu still received a telegram from Yang and others denouncing Sheng, indicating that the new provincial government's orders had not yet reached the counties south of the Tarim Basin.

<h3>The Twists and Turns of the Hai River Rehabilitation Project</h3>
<p>Slackness in the Engineering Rehabilitation Office</p>
<p>The National Economic Commission Should Speedily Reform</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The Hai River management has always been the most important water conservancy project in North China, and it is particularly important for the transportation and commerce of Tianjin Port. Over the years, the river management authorities have spared no expense, claiming to actively manage the river. Unfortunately, there have been unscrupulous elements among the leaders, coupled with various administrative obstacles, which have led to the deterioration of the river channel. If this continues, not only will past efforts be wasted, but the reduction in the river's discharge capacity will expose the million residents of Tianjin to the risk of flooding. The Dagu Shoal waterway is merely an extension of the Hai River, and it is also deteriorating daily, which will inevitably have a significant impact on China's North China economy. The North China Water Conservancy Commission previously formulated five measures for the Hai River remediation project. Subsequently, in the autumn of the 17th year [1928], the Construction Commission, the Ministry of Finance, the Hebei Provincial Government, and the Tianjin Municipal Government jointly organized the Hai River Rehabilitation Committee, and obtained approval from the National Government to issue 4 million yuan in Hai River Dredging Public Bonds, deciding to levy an additional tax on Tianjin Customs duties to serve as funds for repaying the public bonds. In the spring of the 18th year [1929], the Tianjin Customs surcharge began to be levied. The consular corps stationed in Tianjin took the opportunity to inquire about the affairs of the Rehabilitation Committee because foreigners were subject to tax obligations. Among the main engineering personnel of the committee, some took advantage of foreign influence to receive huge monthly salaries. As a result, salaries alone accounted for a staggering 1.6 million yuan. The remediation plan set by the committee originally involved purchasing low-lying areas in the Tahe River depression for the Yongding River floodwater to deposit silt, and then directing part of the clear water into the sea via the Jinzhong River, and another part into the Hai River via the newly opened river. This plan was originally very simple, and it was estimated at the time that it would take at most 18 months to complete. Who would have thought that it would be delayed again and again, and it was not until May of the 21st year [1932] that half of the sea entry project was completed. Seeing that millions of dollars had been spent, but the Hai River was still as silted as ever, at the end of the 21st year, there was a proposal to abolish the Rehabilitation Committee. Later, the government, at the request of Yu Xuezhong, extended it for another year to see the results. However, in addition to recommending to the government that the levy period for the customs surcharge should be extended and another 2 million yuan should be borrowed to complete the original remediation plan, the committee made no progress on the rehabilitation project. Therefore, in December of the 22nd year [1933], the government resolutely abolished the committee, and its uncompleted projects were taken over by the Engineering Rehabilitation Office, organized by the Ministry of Interior in conjunction with the Hebei Provincial Government. According to the outline of the rehabilitation measures determined at that time, all uncompleted projects were to be completed by the flood season of the 23rd year [1934], and extensions could be granted as appropriate if obstacles occurred in fact, but at most they could not exceed the end of December. As for the shortage of 1.92 million yuan in funding, the Ministry of Interior and the Hebei Provincial Government would jointly submit it to the Executive Yuan for approval to extend the Tianjin Customs Surcharge for allocation. In February of the 23rd year, the head of the Engineering Rehabilitation Office, Mao Yisheng, took office. Unexpectedly, Mao went into mourning for his father the day he took office, and was forced to leave Tianjin to attend the funeral. A certain person who held an important position in the Engineering Office of the Rehabilitation Committee and received a huge monthly salary, then resumed his old tricks, using foreign influence to achieve his manipulation and control. The most shocking thing is that on January 12th of this year [1934], the water dam at the mouth of the Yongding River Diversion Canal suddenly burst. Afterwards, someone personally went to the site of the newly breached river mouth for on-the-ground inspection, and it was said that this breach was quite different from a self-breach. Because if a water dam is eroded and breached by river water, the breach on the Yong River side must be inwardly curved into an arc. The two ends of the remaining dam at the river mouth are very straight, and the period of the river mouth opening was during the severe winter, when the earthen dam and river water had long been frozen, making it difficult to erode even if there was a large amount of water, let alone during a low-water period. According to residents of Ge Yu Cheng Town, near the river, someone took five or six crowbars from Zhenxing Hall on the evening of January 11th, pried open the dam, and because the water was not flowing smoothly, they took the crowbars again and widened the dam, resulting in the breach. Observing the current situation, after the newly opened diversion canal trough of the Yongding River is filled and closed in the future, a slight rise in water will inevitably lead to overflow on both the north and south sides, making it difficult to restore the current river channel situation. Who instigated this matter has not yet been ascertained. Fortunately, the government, in view of the need to unify the various water conservancy agencies, has agreed on the outline of the measures for unifying water conservancy administration and undertakings. All original water conservancy agencies in each watershed will be uniformly taken over by the National Economic Commission for overall planning, allocation, and management. The Engineering Rehabilitation Office is a temporary organization, and should be terminated as soon as the project is completed. The Economic Commission bears the heavy responsibility of unifying the national water conservancy agencies, and should promptly carry out thorough reform and find improvement methods, so that the Hai River remediation project, which the people of North China are eagerly awaiting, can be completed as soon as possible, and Tianjin, known as China's second largest port, can flourish.

<h3>Changes in the Administrative System of Fujian Province</h3>
<p>Tightened Budgets for Various Counties</p>
<p>Streamlined Agencies Eliminated</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: The Fujian Provincial Government has recently made several changes to its administrative system, which are described below: (1) Revision of County Grading and Funding: The counties in the province are divided into three grades, with the first-grade counties divided into two levels: Grade A includes 14 counties: Minhou, Putian, Jinjiang, Longxi, Changle, Fu'an, Nanping, Xianyou, Tong'an, Zhangpu, Longyan, Changting, Shaowu, and Pucheng, with a monthly budget of 2,500 yuan; Grade B includes 4 counties: Fuqing, Xiapu, Zhao'an, and Nan'an, with a monthly budget of 2,200 yuan. Second-grade counties include 21 counties: Hui'an, Yongchun, Lianjiang, Gutian, Fuding, Ningde, Haicheng, Zhangping, Anxi, Shunchang, Shaxian, Youxi, Yong'an, Jianyang, Songxi, Zhenghe, Jianning, Liancheng, Shangyuan, Yongding, and Wuping, with a monthly budget of 1,940 yuan. Third-grade counties are also divided into two levels: Grade A includes 16 counties: Luoyuan, Minqing, Yongtai, Nanjing, Changtai, Pinghe, Yunxiao, Dongshan, Jiangle, Ninghua, Datian, Dehua, Siming, Chong'an, and Jinmen, with a monthly budget of 1,570 yuan; Grade B includes 7 counties: Pingnan, Shouning, Qingliu, Mingxi, Taining, Hua'an, and Ningyang, with a monthly budget of 1,380 yuan. (2) Remote areas of various counties, such as Dahu in Minhou, Yingqian in Changle, Nanri in Fuqing, Zhou Dun and Sandu in Ningde, Anhai in Jinjiang, Maxiang in Tong'an, Shima in Longxi, and Yangkou in Shunchang, previously had county assistants or public security bureaus to assist the county government in managing affairs. Due to financial difficulties, they were abolished. Now, it is planned to imitate the organizational methods of the Jiangxi Special District Political Bureau, taking into account local conditions, and first establish political bureaus in six places: Nanri, Sandu, Zhou Dun, Anhai, Maxiang, and Yangkou. Under the command of the administrative commissioner in charge, the bureaus will handle police, financial, construction, and security affairs within their jurisdiction. The internal organization of the bureaus will consist of one director, four assistants, and two or three employees, with a monthly budget of 650 yuan. (3) In terms of financial administration, it has been decided to streamline redundant agencies to concentrate authority and save expenses. Local taxes, except for large and special ones, will be handled by the county governments. A total of 109 bureaus and offices will be eliminated, retaining only nine tax bureaus: Minhou, Siming, Jinjiang, Longxi, Putian, Jian'ou, Fuchang, Hangyong, and Zhuqi. This will save more than 419,000 yuan per year. As for the Seventh District (Longyan) and Eighth District (Changting) Financial Reorganization Offices in the recovered areas of western Fujian, the administrative commissioners of the districts, Chen Yifeng and Lin Sixian, serve concurrently as directors, and the Department of Finance sends Lin Zhaohong and Qi Jue as accounting directors. According to reports, the offices have been organized and will be established on March 1. (February 27)</p>
<h3>Xiamen Real Estate Plunges</h3>
<p>Land Prices Fall to 40-50% But Still No Buyers</p>
<p>Nearly One-Third of Shops Are Vacant</p>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: Since the Navy established the Road Administration in the Xiamen urban area in the 16th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1927], it has actively developed roads, built embankments and parks, and opened up residential markets, which caused land prices to soar. The 19th year [1930] was the golden age of real estate. At that time, all those engaged in real estate made huge profits. By the 21st year [1932], the communists occupied Zhangzhou, and property owners became wary. Those who had not invested in real estate held back, and those who had already invested sold off their properties. In the past one or two years, Nanyang [Southeast Asian] trade has declined sharply, and remittances from overseas Chinese have decreased significantly. Moreover, overseas Chinese capital is also nearing depletion. Xiamen real estate was originally mostly invested by overseas Chinese, so land prices have fallen drastically. From last winter to this spring, Xiamen's commerce has been depressed, finance has been difficult, and rents have plummeted, yet many properties remain vacant. As a result, real estate and houses have become increasingly neglected. Recalling the 19th and 20th years [1930-1931], land prices on Datong Road and Zhongshan Road were sold for more than 3,000 or 5,000 yuan per square zhang [a traditional unit of area]. Now, they have fallen to 30-40% of that price, and mortgages are at 25%, yet there are still no buyers at any price. The grounding of the Xiamen Bank and the collapse of large money shops such as Yufeng and Jianyuan this spring were the result of investing in real estate or engaging in real estate mortgages. According to a recent official survey, in the market center of Zhongshan Road, 37 shops are vacant. On Datong Road, 68 shops are vacant. The only section with relatively few vacancies is the section of Siming South Road from Siming Theater to the intersection of Zhongshan Road. On the rest of the coast, 33 shops are vacant on Lujiang Road. On Tongwen, Chenguang, and Hutoushan Roads, 68 shops are vacant. On Siming East and North Roads, there are more than 20 vacancies each. On average, the number of vacant shops on each road accounts for about one-third of the total. In the brothel area of Siming South Road, Dashi, 50 shops are vacant, accounting for half of the total. It is remembered that a row of more than ten Renji shop buildings on Datong Road was offered for 400,000 yuan by Chen Guohui before the 21st year [1932], but the deal fell through because the middleman demanded 20,000 yuan. Recently, it was offered for sale at 180,000 yuan, but still no buyer. From this, one can know the state of commerce in Xiamen. (February 28)</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>District Chief Wanted, Property Confiscated</p>
<p>Wang Wuqing, the district chief of the Eighth District, has extensive social connections and spends lavishly. During his five years in office, he has embezzled a considerable amount of district funds. The amount of funds embezzled for the single item of disaster relief has already reached more than 7,000 yuan. After being discovered by the provincial committee, Peng Baichuan, the county magistrate of Kunshan County, dispatched police to summon the district chief to the county for questioning, but Wang had already escaped. The county government then submitted a report to the province to issue a warrant for his arrest and to recover the embezzled funds. It is now learned that the county government has discovered that Wang has real estate in the name of Wang Hanchen (the district chief's father), consisting of over 800 mu of farmland and a residence covering four mu, valued at approximately 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, which has been confiscated in preparation for auctioning it off to repay the debt. However, Wang had long separated from his brother, and all the farmland in his own name had already been mortgaged. Now that the county government has confiscated everything, it is said that all the creditors are in a panic.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Shelter Prevents Enticement and Lewd Schemes</p>
<p>Last year, Wangdian, Xiashi, and other places in Jiaxing Prefecture, Zhejiang Province, were affected by drought, resulting in a poor harvest. Farmers, young and old, accompanied by their families, traveled to Songjiang in groups to seek food. This county first had the relief agency send personnel to provide daily rations. Then, Zhou Xuewen and Zhu Jiuwang, directors of the Mountain Red Cross Branch, acting out of neighborly benevolence, opened a shelter at Chao Guo Temple, providing the refugees from Zhejiang Province with food and lodging. Some of them went out to seek relief. Among the refugees were young women who, although pale, were relatively beautiful, and some people took the opportunity to seduce them. The staff of the shelter found that Wang Chen, a refugee aged 28, was escorted back to the shelter every evening by Zhou Gengsheng, a local man, in a suspicious manner, fearing there might be an enticement going on. The man and the woman were sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. As a result, there were no grounds to accuse them of enticement, but to prevent any possible harm, it was decided to hand Wang Chen over to her aunt, Wang Jiang, to take her back to her home, and the association would pay her fare home. Zhou Gengsheng, who has been running a small stall at the station, was detained for three days as a warning because of his improper behavior.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Various Industries Jointly Petition for Reduction of Property Tax</p>
<p>The Wu County South Goods Industry, Timber Industry, Chinese and Foreign Cloth Industry, Silk Industry, and more than ten other industry guilds, recognizing that Wu County's property tax is divided into two types: one for businesses at ten percent of the property value, and one for residents at five percent of the property value, both with an additional 15% levy for security expenses. After the Security Corps was reorganized into the Provincial Security Brigade last year, local figures had already petitioned and received approval from the provincial authorities to cease the additional levy for security expenses starting from the 24th year. Unexpectedly, it was recently reported that the Finance Department issued an order stipulating that property tax for businesses must be 15% of the property value and 8% for residents, an increase over the previous rate. In the midst of the current economic downturn, people simply cannot afford the burden. Furthermore, there are more than twenty counties in Jiangsu that have not yet implemented property tax. Why then increase the tax rate for counties that have already implemented it? This seems unfair. Therefore, they have jointly sent a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce to forward to the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments, requesting a reduction in the tax to ease the burden.</p>
<p>Reactionary Elements Cause Trouble in Suzhou</p>
<p>Suzhou's various theaters have recently received threatening letters from a self-proclaimed "White Blood Group Communist General Group." The details of this have already been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the Da Guangming Cinema in the North District of the city also received a letter from the group yesterday, threatening to extort 5,000 yuan, with a two-day deadline for payment and a prohibition on reporting to the authorities. After receiving the letter, the cinema immediately secretly reported it to the Second Sub-bureau. Huang Tianyi, the chief of the sub-bureau, has dispatched plainclothes police to investigate secretly. Zhang, the chief of the Public Security Bureau, believes that reactionary elements are attempting to cause trouble in Suzhou, but because the matter concerns local tranquility, he has secretly ordered the detective team to pay close attention, it is said.</p>
<p>Industry Representatives Petition Regarding Business Tax</p>
<p>The Wu County Business Tax Bureau has recently dispatched a large number of officials to various stores to urge them to fill out declaration forms and will directly audit accounts on a household-by-household basis. The County Chamber of Commerce is deeply concerned about this matter, fearing that misunderstandings may arise. Therefore, on the afternoon of the first day, they convened a meeting of industry representatives. The chairman was Cheng Ganqing. All representatives agreed that the business and capital amounts for the 23rd year had already been declared for the county's business tax, and the 24th year had not yet begun. At this time, there was no need to urge the filling out of declaration forms or audit accounts. Eight people, including Pan Ziqi, Shen Bingzhang, Zhang Shoupeng, Fan Junbo, Xu Xiaozhai, and Ji Xiaosong, were immediately elected as representatives. Yesterday (the second day) at noon, they first went to the County Party Headquarters and the County Government to petition. The County Magistrate of Wu County received them. The Special Commissioner Sun and the Chief of the Public Security Bureau Zhang were both at the County Government at the time and met with them simultaneously. The representatives explained their intentions and requested a delay in the investigation. The County Magistrate of Wu County agreed to consult with Guo, the Chief of the Business Tax Bureau, to handle the matter. The representatives then left.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Drama Troupe Member Entices Two Female Students</p>
<p>Since last winter, Tan Huang opera has become popular here, with four new troupes appearing within a month. The performers all come from elsewhere. Recently, two female students were abducted at the same time. One was Weng Shuzhen, the niece of Weng Zhenbo, the current section chief of the Nanjing Military Commission, a graduate of the County Girls' High School. Because she went to watch the opera every day, she was enticed into an adulterous relationship by Jiang Yueming, a member of the Xin Guang Opera Troupe. Later, through Weng, she introduced Xi Ruiyu, a third-year student at the County Girls' High School, and they formed an inseparable bond. The two girls, passionately in love, stole everything they had and quietly left Changshu together, hiding in the Central Hotel in Changzhou. Recently, the families of both have been searching everywhere and have reported to the detective team for assistance, but without any trace. Now, the man and women, having run out of money, Xi accompanied Jiang back to Changshu to find a solution, while Weng remained in Changzhou. When they returned to Changshu, they were arrested by the detective team and transferred to the County Government by the Public Security Bureau for questioning on the first day. According to Xi, she is seventeen years old and was easily tempted by Jiang because of her youth and weak will. When questioned, Jiang Yueming denied enticing her. He was immediately ordered to be detained. As for Weng Shuzhen in Changzhou, the authorities used a long-distance telephone to instruct the county to keep her there and wait for her family to come and claim her.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Crackdown on Opium Den, Assaulting Police and Resisting Arrest</p>
<p>The County Public Security Bureau received a secret report yesterday that Sun Caizhi had privately established an opium den inside the No. 11 doorplate of Huishan Zhijie Street for people to smoke opium, and requested the arrest. At about 3:00 p.m., the temporary inspector Feng Yimao, led four police officers from the car patrol team, went to search the address. Sun Caizhi, and three smoking customers, including Sun Ronggen, were arrested on the spot, along with opium pipes and lamps. Just as they were about to take them to the bureau, Liu Sanda led more than ten hooligans who came to the scene and beat the police officers and snatched the three opium offenders. Feng Yimao, seeing the situation was not good, immediately arrested Liu Sanda, the leader of the robbers, and sent a police telegram to the headquarters for assistance. The Inspector General Wang immediately dispatched the police chief Zhu Bangzhao, leading more than ten police officers from the car patrol team, to the rescue. When the gang saw a large number of police officers coming, they fled in all directions. Subsequently, Feng Yimao chased and caught Song Jintang and Pan Tingmei, who assaulted the police and robbed the prisoners, at Xishan, and took them to the bureau for interrogation. The injured police officers were sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Petition to Prohibit Speculative Trading in Exchanges</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation held a meeting in Wuxi on the 21st of last month. The Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce proposed to prevent speculative trading of cotton yarn and to protect industry. The proposal was passed according to the original plan. Yesterday, the Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation telegraphed the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Industry and the Shanghai Cotton Industry Control Committee, stating: "The Shanghai Chinese Cotton and Cloth Exchange's daily transactions are all short sales, and speculators gather there, causing the market value of domestically produced cotton yarn and cloth to fluctuate day and night, shaking in this whirlpool of panic and unable to stabilize. The most serious thing is that the market value of cotton yarn is reversed, and the exchange buys and sells short, focusing on speculation, the market loses its balance, and the situation is on the verge of collapse. Shanghai factories cannot maintain themselves and are closing down one after another. Inland yarn factories, especially in Wuxi, cannot be ignored. This matter concerns the lifeline of the national yarn factory and the livelihood of workers, which is extremely important and significant. It is proposed to forward to the central government to strictly prohibit speculative trading of cotton yarn in exchanges, in order to balance the market and protect the yarn industry. The executive and supervisory meeting of the Association discussed and agreed that the establishment of the exchange was originally intended to regulate supply and demand and equalize prices. In all countries around the world with cotton production, the exchange has never priced cotton yarn and cotton at the same time, fearing that speculation and manipulation would harm the root. For example, Japan auctions yarn but not cotton, and the United Kingdom and the United States auction cotton but not yarn, which are clear examples. However, the Shanghai Chinese Cotton and Cloth Exchange auctions both cotton yarn and cotton at the same time, allowing speculators to succeed in their monopolistic manipulation. The price of cotton is auctioned higher and higher. According to the current calculation of the spot yarn price of the standard cotton, each bale of cotton yarn has to lose more than 20 yuan. The yarn industry is related to the national foundation, and it is necessary to maintain it. The yarn and cloth exchange is named and registered with yarn and cloth products, and it should be the principle of auctioning yarn and cloth. It should not abandon cloth and infringe on the raw material of cotton for yarn and cloth. This distinction is very clear. The country maintains the industry, and it is important to reverse the decline. It is proposed to order the Shanghai Chinese Cotton and Cloth Exchange to maintain a balance between the auction prices of cotton yarn. If the manufacturing costs of the 20-count standard yarn, calculated by the market weight of 430 kilograms of standard cotton (excluding unified tax, less than 45 yuan), should immediately stop the auction or directly stop the cotton trading to stabilize the cotton market and protect the industry.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Provincial Committee Inspects River Works in Changzhou</p>
<p>The dredging of the Zhenwu Canal in Jiangsu Province is a huge project with a large amount of funding. Shen Baixian, the director of the Construction Department, personally came to Changzhou to inspect it. Yesterday (the first day), he specially sent the chief secretary Xiao Kaiying to Changzhou. He first went to the office of the seventh section of the Zhenyun Canal outside the East Gate to meet with Director Shi Ziquan and was satisfied with all the facilities. Then he went to the county to meet with County Magistrate Hou and instructed him to ensure that the recruitment of workers for the dredging project must meet the quota on time during the tense period. At about 2:00 p.m., he left Changzhou by car to Cheng, to inspect the Huangtiangang dredging project in the county, and then returned to the department to report.</p>

<p>Robbery Alarm in Huangling Township</p>
<p>In Huangling Township outside the West Gate of the county, many robbers came on the night before yesterday, about half a mile away from the township. The sentry of the County Security Brigade stationed there saw them and immediately returned to the team to report. The squad leader there led the entire squad of police officers to resist the enemy. Seeing that there were many robbers, they ordered the entire squad of police officers to fire their guns as a warning. The bullets rained down, and the robbers fled in disarray. Because the squad was too small, they did not pursue them deeply. Now, the agricultural education hall there and the villagers of the township have come to the county to request that more troops be sent to the township to suppress them.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Brother-in-law Sues Brother-in-law for Robbing His Wife</p>
<p>Yang Xueshan, a farmer from Yangjiazhuang in Jiangdu South Township, had his wife, Zheng, hidden in the alley of Lugua in Wanzi Street in the city by his brother-in-law, Wang Fengjin. Yang's brother, Xuehe, found them and brought them to the First Sub-bureau of Public Security, who advised them to go to the judicial authorities to file a lawsuit. Later, the matter was settled through mediation. Now, Yang Xueshan claims that Wang Fengjin, together with Li Mao and others, robbed Zheng again and has filed a complaint with the Jiangdu Court's Prosecutor's Office, summoning the defendant to the case for questioning. The defendant firmly denied it. The plaintiff submitted the case file from the First Sub-bureau and the eyewitness testimony of the villagers at the time of the robbery. The defendant was ordered to post bail and wait for the summons of witnesses for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Haimen</h3>
<p>Please Thoroughly Investigate the Grain Tax Embezzlement Case</p>
<p>Guo Xixian, Ding Jiaxiang, Gao Qijie, Chen Xianbang, Feng Guozhu and other staff members of the county's Grain Tax督征處 embezzled more than 60,000 yuan of public funds. County Magistrate Chen discovered this, interrogated Guo Xixian and others, detained them, and ordered them to return the money within a time limit. After this incident occurred, local people paid extraordinary attention to it and petitioned the Provincial Government and the Department of Finance to send officials to Haimen to investigate thoroughly. Now, county residents Chen Jie, Tang Yanqi and others have suggested to various agencies and organizations to form a Haimen County Grain Tax 清理 Committee to review the exact amount of grain tax revenue over the years, supervise the county government, and severely punish the corrupt officials, in order to warn against corruption.</p>

<h3>Yu Feipeng Received the Press Yesterday</h3>
<p>Published Written Remarks on His Impressions of the Inspection</p>
<p>Praised the Progress of Transportation Equipment in Europe and America</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Yu Feipeng and his party of five from the transportation group of the Military Transportation Inspection Team returned to the country and arrived in Shanghai on the first day. Yu and others will stay in Shanghai for ten days. Yu also received reporters from various newspapers at his private residence on Baylor Road at 3:00 p.m. yesterday and issued a</p>
<p>Written Statement</p>
<p>saying, "I was ordered to go abroad in May of last year to inspect various transportation policies, and traveled with General Xu Tingyao of the Ministry of Military Affairs. After arriving in Europe, I visited England, the United States, France, Italy, Germany, Soviet Russia, Poland, Austria, and Czechoslovakia. I crossed the United States from England in January of this year and returned to China yesterday. My companions were Commander Jiang Ou, Chief Engineer Wei Yifu, Engineer Wu Baofeng, and Engineer Chen Xu. General Xu and his party started from Europe and will arrive in Shanghai before the 10th of this month. During this tour of Europe and the United States, all the countries we visited gave us various conveniences, so the progress was smooth. The transportation industries in Europe and the United States, such as road, telegraph, postal, and shipping construction, are very complete. Whether in large cities or remote locations, there are almost always various transportation facilities. Now that science is developed and technology is advanced, various countries are also conducting intensive research and vigorous progress in new transportation construction. Regarding railways, (1) is the improvement of steam locomotives, which increases speed and saves fuel. (2) is the internal combustion engine train, which is formally undergoing testing. Its speed can reach 110 miles per hour. In addition, regarding expenses, (1) is the standardization of machinery. Since the procedures are fixed, replenishment is naturally convenient. (2) is the mechanized train assembly yard, which works quickly. (3) is the railway repair shop. (4) is the old material utilization factory, which is considered to save costs in every possible way. Furthermore, various countries are making every effort to build highways. No matter how remote a place is, there is a highway to reach it. Now there are about 9 million miles of highways and about 33.4 million cars in the world, which is a truly amazing record. Regarding the telegraphic administration, (1) is wireless radio facsimile. Since the invention of this kind of facsimile, it only takes six or seven minutes to send and receive from Europe to the United States. (2) is ultra-high frequency radio, which is also being tested. (3) is carrier wave telegraph and telephone. This kind of equipment can simultaneously send 18 telegrams on a pair of lines. (4) is television, which is also being actively tested and can be used for broadcasting television. (5) is a telephone that uses telegraph. This kind of machine is very useful. In addition, various countries are developing long-distance telephones more universally and rapidly. Regarding the postal service, the tidiness and speed of the internal equipment of its organs need not be discussed. Even if we look at the promotion of rural postal services, there is almost no place that cannot be reached by mail, and the convenience can be imagined. In addition, for long-distance mail, there is airmail, and even ordinary letters can be delivered by air. The prosperous cities also have air transport pipe equipment for mail, and the speed is indescribable. Regarding shipping administration, although the tonnage of ships was large before the European War, the utility was limited. After the European War, the tonnage decreased, and the utility increased, because the ships were rebuilt, the equipment was perfect, and the speed was increased. This is one. After the European War, the inland rivers were greatly dredged, and navigation was extremely convenient, and the number of ships over 100 tons was greatly increased. This is two. From the above, it can be seen that European and American countries use science to carry out various new transportation constructions, and their advantages are worthy of reference. My impression after the inspection is excellent, and I also think that the reason why European and American countries attach great importance to transportation is that transportation has a major and close relationship with politics, military affairs, and economics, and is the foundation of the country's lifeline. Now, taking advantage of the opportunity to talk to you, I will briefly describe the general situation. The detailed situation will be submitted to the government in a formal report."</p>
<p>Joint Banquet</p>
<p>Yu is scheduled to stay in Shanghai for ten days before going to Beijing to visit President Wang of the Executive Yuan and Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Communications, and then to Hubei to visit Chairman Jiang to report the details of the trip. The local Merchants Bureau, Eurasia China Airlines, International Telecommunications Bureau, and Shanghai Telegraph Bureau and other agencies hosted a public banquet at Liu Hongsheng's residence on Julida Road at 6:00 p.m. last night to welcome Yu. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves. Mayor Wu and others are also scheduled to host a banquet for Yu in the next few days, it is said.</p>
<p>Inspection Schedule</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency, Yu is scheduled to inspect various transportation agencies in the city. The inspection schedule has been set. It is reported that the Ministry of Communications has instructed the subordinate agencies in the city to comply with the schedule, which starts on the fourth of this month. In terms of telecommunications, the International Telecommunication Bureau and the Radio Station one day, the Telegraph Bureau and the Electrical Material Storage and Transfer Office one day, the Telegraph Bureau and the Ministry's Material Storage Committee one day. In terms of postal services, the Postal Remittance and Storage Bureau one day, the Postal Administration General Supply Office and the Postal Administration Bureau together one day. In terms of shipping, the China Merchants Bureau General Office one day, the No. 4 Wharf Repair Factory one day, the Shipping Administration Bureau in the morning, and the Wusong Merchant Ship School in the afternoon together one day. In terms of aviation, China Aviation Corporation and Eurasia Aviation Corporation together one day. The inspection will be completed in a total of nine days, from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and from 2:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. every day.</p>
<h3>Qian Chengxu Goes to Shandong at the Summons of Han</h3>
<p>Conveniently Lectures for About Ten Days Before Returning to Shanghai</p>
<p>Qian Chengxu, Secretary-General of the China Industrial Federation, went to the United States last year at the invitation of the United States to lecture and inspect the country's light industry. He returned to Shanghai in October. Han Fuju, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, and Shen Honglie, Mayor of Qingdao, telegraphed Qian to invite him to Shandong for negotiations. Later, it could not be done due to matters. Now Chairman Han has again urged him by telegram. Qian is leaving for Lu today at 8:00 a.m. on the early express train. A reporter from New Voice News inquired about the purpose of the trip. According to him, Shandong Province is the only supply area for industrial raw materials in China, so it has a chronic trade deficit. In the first half of last year, because there were many transactions between places, various payments were generally able to be received after the due date, and there was no feeling of difficult circumstances. However, since June, problems have occurred with silver, the market has tightened currency, transactions have been scarce, freight has been stagnant, and the economy has been affected. The current economic organization has two systems: (1) financial capital, (2) industrial capital. The financial capital of all countries in the world is direct, and the industrial organization is horizontal, echoing each other and increasing the chips. Although China's financial capital organization has a history of nine years, the industrial capital organization is still in its infancy. To increase market chips, industrial capital must work hard to increase chips before it can overcome this extraordinary difficulty. Furthermore, China is a manufacturing country with a huge domestic market, and its economic situation is not comparable to that of England and Japan. It must promote the sales of goods abroad. Therefore, in this situation, it is not necessary to adopt a progressive currency expansion step. There are other forces to maintain its self-sufficiency and self-supply status. Shandong has the possibility of developing industrial capital, and the implementation steps must first organize material storage warehouses, use the remaining raw materials of farmers, and provide a certain amount as the warehouse reserve. If a considerable amount is obtained, material price securities can be issued. Shanxi has actively advocated the organization of warehouses. Last year, it was discussed with Chairman Han, because there was no urgent need in fact. Now that there is a shortage of chips on the market, the establishment of warehouses can no longer be delayed. Therefore, I will go to Jinan and Qingdao to talk with Chairman Han and Mayor Shen. Moreover, the markets in Qingdao and Jinan need to cooperate with Shanghai. After the method is determined in the future, the leaders of the financial and industrial sectors of the city will be invited to Lu to negotiate, it is said. It is also heard that after Qian arrives in Lu, he plans to give lectures on economics for two days, and will stay for about ten days before returning to Shanghai, it is said.</p>
<h3>Dr. Hedin to Return to Country Northward Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Swedish explorer Dr. Sven Hedin, accompanied by his assistant Dr. Noring, came to China this time and was ordered by the Ministry of Railways to survey the Suixin Highway, which was quite meritorious. Dr. Hedin has now completed his mission in China and specially went south a few days ago to visit Chairman Lin, President Wang, Chairman Jiang, and Minister Gu to say goodbye. He is scheduled to return to the country northward tomorrow via Siberia, it is said.</p>
<h3>Hunan Province Implements Ban on Rice Export</h3>
<p>Promulgated from March 1st</p>
<p>Hunan rice has always been sold to Guangdong and Ningbo. Currently, there are still a lot of people from these two groups who has already purchased rice, and it has not yet been shipped. Recently, the price of rice in Hunan has soared suddenly, and the selling price per stone has exceeded 11 yuan (but the rice stone is larger than in Shanghai). The people of Hunan are panicking. The provincial authorities have proposed to abolish the export permits for rice in order to relieve the rice shortage and protect the food supply of the province. The provincial government has ordered that the policy of blocking food exports from the province will be implemented from March 1st. Hunan rice will not be allowed to be shipped out of Hunan from the date of promulgation of the ban, and can only be circulated and supplied within the province. Yesterday, this port has received a telegram from Changsha, saying that the export ban on food has been promulgated, and those who have already purchased it but have not yet shipped it are afraid that they will not be able to ship it.</p>
<h3>江南 Railway Company Undertakes Jing City Railway</h3>
<p>Contract Signed, Lease Term Twenty Years, Monthly Rent Three Thousand</p>
<p>Personnel Dispatched to Beijing to Take Over, Transfer to be Completed Within a Week</p>
<p>The Jiangnan Railway Joint-Stock Company on Foch Road in this city considers Nanjing as China's capital, and transportation is quite important. Therefore, after consultation with the Beijing Municipal Government, it has leased the Beijing City Railway to enrich and develop it. The lease contract has been formally signed, and on the first day, personnel were dispatched to Beijing to take over. A reporter from the New News Agency recorded the contract as follows:</p>
<p>Contract Signed</p>
<p>The Jiangnan Railway Company and the Beijing Municipal Government, after several consultations, have agreed on the lease contract for the Beijing City Railway, totaling ten articles. The contract has been formally signed at the Beijing Municipal Government.

The witnesses included Wu Zhihui, a member of the Central Committee, Lai Lian, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, Xiong Tingling, the Secretary, Zhang Jianming, a Councilor, as well as managers and technicians from the Jiangnan Railway Company, all of whom participated in the listing. It has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for record. The Jiangnan Company also dispatched personnel to take over on the first day, and the takeover is expected to be fully completed within a week.</p>
<p>Lease Term Twenty Years</p>
<p>The main content of the contract is as follows: (1) The Nanjing Municipal Government agrees, from the date of establishment of this contract, to lease all properties and equipment such as land, tracks, houses, and vehicles specified in the attachment of the Beijing City Railway to the Jiangnan Railway Company for use.

The roadside shall be marked with a map separately. The station land shall be leased in its entirety according to the original land. (2) The Jiangnan Railway Company agrees, from the date of handover to the date of cancellation of the contract, to pay the Municipal Government a monthly rent of three thousand silver dollars per month.

Except for natural consumption that cannot be preserved, if there are any shortages, compensation shall be paid according to the market price. At the expiration of the contract, the company shall not dismantle or request compensation from the Municipal Government for all ordinary equipment that has been replaced, such as tracks and sleepers.

The rest shall be dismantled by the company itself upon expiration. (5) The road construction project from Zhongzheng Street to outside the South Gate shall be handled by the Jiangnan Railway Company. The Municipal Government shall do its best to assist.

<h3>Pu'an Collides with British Ship, Settled for 50,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Negotiations for More Than a Year Have Ended</p>
<p>Last year, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Pu'an ship damaged the British Blue Funnel Line's Philoctetes ship in the Huangpu River. Afterwards, the Blue Funnel Line issued a loss bill, totaling more than 131,000 yuan for repairs and other items, and repeatedly demanded compensation from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. At that time, it was once advocated to submit it to public arbitration. As a result, the case was shelved for a long time due to the opposition of the insurance company. Later, the British businessman submitted a negotiation to the Ministry of Communications, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had returned the Pu'an ship to the Ministry of the Navy. The Blue Funnel Line urged the payment of the compensation more than once. The insurance company commissioned lawyer Wei to deal with it. The case was delayed for almost a year. Recently, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's insurance company sent personnel to directly negotiate with the British Blue Funnel Line. After several meetings, the Blue Funnel Line also expressed concessions, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company paid 50,000 yuan to resolve it. This amount was borne and allocated by the insurance company. Yesterday, it was heard that 50,000 yuan had been handed over to the British businessman for receipt, and a dispute has ended.</p>
<h3>The First Half of the Ji'an Steamer Has Been Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>This Kind of Salvage Work</p>
<p>Is Still Pioneering in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Report stated that the Ji'an steamer, which sailed from Hankou and ran aground and broke on Tongzhou Island on January 11 (220 feet long, 40 feet wide, 1788 tons, built by Yesson Shipyard in 1907), has had its first half transported to Shanghai this morning (2nd) after seven weeks of work by Chinese and foreign experts and divers, with the assistance of the tugboats Socie and Agrout. The Socie, carrying this "special cargo", arrived at Songkou after dusk yesterday, and is expected to sail into the Huangpu River this morning. This is a pioneering move in Shanghai. With such achievements in mechanical and salvage work, it is worthy of being the fifth largest port in the world. It was originally planned to tie the two sections of the Ji'an ship to the left and right sides of the Socie and transport them to Shanghai at the same time, but because the second half was in a special position, the cargo in the cabin could not be cleared for a while. It was decided to transport the first half to Shanghai first, and the second half will also be transported within a few weeks. This time, the Far Eastern Salvage Company worked for six weeks to remove the cargo from the first half and transport it to Shanghai for sale. Then the water in the cabin was pumped out with a water pump, and the first half was able to float. During the transfer of the rear cargo, the floating first half was used as a storage place. A few days ago, the keel of the ship was shortened with a chemical flame. Since the water quality of the Yangtze River is turbid and contains sand, it is extremely difficult for divers to work underwater. Now experts are still trying to isolate the exposed part of the rear section from the water, and drill a hole in the deck, from which the goods are taken out and transported to Shanghai at any time.</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Overseas Chinese Expelled from Japan Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Xia Haiyan and 33 Others Returned Home by Two Ships</p>
<p>Representatives Were Elected Yesterday to Petition Separately in Beijing</p>
<p>The Industrial Society stated that since Japan's expulsion of overseas Chinese, more than 400 refugees have been expelled to Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon, another large group of 33 refugees arrived in Shanghai on the Shanghai Maru and Rokko Maru respectively. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau sent investigator Hou Can to express condolences and promised to issue relief funds of five yuan per person tomorrow. The information obtained is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>List of Expelled Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>The overseas Chinese expelled from Japan who arrived in Shanghai on the Rokko Maru yesterday included Xia Haiyan (and his wife, two sons, and one daughter), Ye Yiguang, Zheng Linshu, Zhou Deshun, Zhou Ruixi, Hu Xifeng, Wang Shoulian, Lin Qiaoyou, Zhou Dexun, Xu Jingeng, Hu Huachi, Zheng Liubao, Liu Dechun, Wu Dengyun, Pan Changluan, Xu Jinkai, Zhou Tilong, and 21 others. They were all from Wenzhou Yongjia Qingtian and other places. Those who returned home on the Shanghai Maru included Lin Shunfa, Yang Yanqing, Lin Liangxian, Yang Benjing, Wang Changcai, Wang Yafang, Wang Bingri, Wang Changhe, Weng Guifang, Gao Mushui (and two others whose names are unknown), and 12 others. They were all from Fuzhou. It is said that there are more than ten party members among them.</p>
<p>Representatives to Report to Beijing</p>
<p>The large number of refugees who arrived in Shanghai yesterday believed that Japan's repeated expulsion of overseas Chinese had a very large conspiracy, so they specially elected representative Xu Jizhuang to take the night train to Beijing tomorrow to report to the Central Committee of the Kuomintang, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in order to save the overseas Chinese in Japan.</p>
<p>Refugees to Cultivate in Anhui</p>
<p>A reporter inquired from the Refugee Relief Association yesterday that the seventh refugee Wu Xubiao in the fourth batch approved by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee originally planned to go to Qiaole Village in Anhui Province for cultivation, but because of the lack of travel expenses, Xu Jizhuang of the Refugee Relief Association requested the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau to transfer to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for free rides to Anhui. It has been approved, but only two people are allowed to ride each time. Therefore, the refugees are ready to send two people to Anhui for cultivation tomorrow night. As for who will go to Anhui, it will be decided by drawing lots temporarily.</p>
<p>The Relief Association Held a Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>Xu Jizhuang and others from the Refugee Relief Association held an emergency meeting yesterday because the number of refugees expelled yesterday exceeded the previous batches, in order to prepare to maintain the livelihood of the refugees. According to Xu Jizhuang from the association, although the association is preparing to maintain the livelihood of the refugees, its strength is limited. I hope that all sectors of the city will give their utmost assistance in order to be effective.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu is Scheduled to Host a Banquet for the Italian Ambassador</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu originally planned to host a banquet for the Italian Ambassador to China, Mr. Aloisi, a few days ago, but it was temporarily postponed due to his ill health. It is now learned that Mayor Wu has scheduled to host a banquet for the Italian Ambassador at his private residence on Haig Road at 7:00 pm on the 7th, and invited Gu Weijun, the Chinese Minister to France, and envoys from various countries in Shanghai to accompany him.</p>
<h3>The Social Bureau's Investigation Confirms That There Are More Than 700,000 Workers in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Divided into Three Categories: Industry, Commerce, and Transportation</p>
<p>The Investigation Has Been Completed and the Report Has Begun to Be Prepared</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency stated that the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau, in view of the fact that there has never been a statistic on workers in Shanghai, specially commissioned the Benefiting Workers Division of the Third Section to organize a general survey of workers in Shanghai. Since it began in June last year, the survey has been completed and the report has begun to be prepared. It is divided into three categories: (1) industrial workers, (2) commercial workers, and (3) transportation workers. The bureau has investigated industrial workers many times in the past, but it is not very complete. Commercial and transportation workers have never been investigated. This time it took several months to complete the investigation. There are a total of about 700,000 workers in the city.</p>

<h3>The Shenxin No. 7 Factory Matter Will Be Resolved After Minister Kong Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>HSBC Bank Has Made a Clear Statement</p>
<p>The Japanese Consulate Denies That Japanese Merchants Have Purchased It</p>
<p>The Central News Agency stated that after the British HSBC Bank arbitrarily auctioned off the Shenxin No. 7 Factory, the Chinese people unanimously fought for it. The government also telegraphed the local authorities in this city by the Executive Yuan to assist in the handling. In the past few days, the future of the negotiations has gradually revealed a glimmer of hope. A reporter from the Central News Agency has compiled the news obtained yesterday as follows:</p>
<p>Kong Will Return to Shanghai</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Hankou, Mr. and Mrs. Song and Kong flew to Hankou to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to discuss financial issues, which have come to an end and will return to Shanghai by the original plane within days. It is reported that Kong will come to Shanghai after meeting with President Wang in Beijing to discuss the issue of rescuing the Shenxin No. 7 Factory.</p>
<p>HSBC Expressed</p>
<p>The attitude of HSBC is due to the unanimous support of all sectors of our country, fearing that it will affect Sino-British relations. It has clearly stated that if Shenxin has a solution, the auction contract that has been established can also be withdrawn. It is rumored that the two Japanese lawyers Okamoto and Nakamura represent non-Japanese merchants.</p>
<p>Prepare to Redeem</p>
<p>The Central News Agency's Nanjing telegram on the 2nd stated that regarding the redemption of the Shenxin No. 7 Yarn Factory, the Ministry of Finance and Industry has actively planned rescue measures, and the Shanghai Municipal Government has worked hard to negotiate with HSBC Bank. The situation is very good. Roughly, the arrears of interest owed to the bank of 250,000 yuan will be allocated in advance, and the arrears will be fully repaid in four months in order to redeem the Shenxin Factory.</p>
<p>The Japanese Side Denies</p>
<p>The purchaser of this auction of Shenxin No. 7 Factory requested Japanese lawyers Okamoto and Murakami as representatives, so the general public regarded it as purchased by Japanese merchants. The Japanese Consul, in order to avoid causing resentment among the Chinese people who are improving Sino-Japanese relations, issued a statement the day before yesterday saying, "Regarding the auction of the Shenxin Textile Factory, some people have publicized that the buyer is a Japanese merchant. However, the results of the investigation by this consulate of Japanese yarn factories and companies have made it clear that the buyer is not Japanese. This is hereby declared."</p>
<p>Shenxin Situation</p>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency met with Rong Hongyuan, the son of Rong Zongjing of Shenxin Textile Company, yesterday. According to him, this issue can only be decided after Minister Kong of Finance comes to Shanghai. He also said that the company's yarn sales have been smooth recently, or it may be due to the Shenxin No. 7 Factory incident.</p>

<h3>South District Rent Reduction Committee's Letter to H.E. Gewk-Mi</h3>
<p>The Landlord of Nine Acres of Land Has Already Indicated Rent Reduction</p>
<p>The Shanghai South City District Rent Reduction Committee is sparing no effort in its rent reduction appeals. Several hundred new houses in the Nine Acres of Land, Luxiangyuan Road, owned by Anhe Company, are inhabited by middle-class people and above. The Rent Reduction Committee, recognizing the recent rapid appreciation of the Nine Acres of Land's market conditions, sent a letter to Anhe Company requesting a reduction in rent to promote the prosperity of the area. It is reported that after receiving the letter, the company announced yesterday that it would temporarily collect rent at 95% of the original price. In the commercial center area of the British Concession, empty houses stand in rows. The Rent Reduction Committee sent a letter to H.E. Gewk-Mi of Hardoon Realties, requesting that he voluntarily reduce rent. The original letter is recorded below.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>In recent times, the economy of our Chinese people is on the verge of bankruptcy. Both rural and urban areas have been affected. Shanghai, once known as the "Paris of the East," also presents a picture of commercial depression and market stagnation, a far cry from previous years. Even in Shanghai's most prosperous areas, such as the area surrounding Nanjing Road, most of the tall buildings and mansions are owned by Hardoon Realties. Recently, due to poor market conditions and high rents, businesses have closed and people have moved away in large numbers, especially in the new buildings between Great Malu and Second Malu. Before the renovation of that area, its residents and businesses were densely packed. Why was this? Because the rent was low, and there was harmony like in the times of Emperors Yao and Shun. After the renovation, because the rent increased more than tenfold, since its completion several years ago, nine out of ten houses remain empty. Some have tried to pay exorbitant rents in hopes of restoring the area's prosperity, but ultimately, the abundance of empty houses and the scarcity of businesses have led to few pedestrians and reluctant customers. Therefore, high rents are a fatal wound to the market.</p>
<p>The late H.E. Hardoon, a great tycoon in Shanghai, held the leading position in the real estate industry. During his lifetime, he performed numerous good deeds, but it is regrettable that his descendants have not followed in his footsteps. We have long admired your respect for Buddhism and your practice of universal love and benevolence to relieve all suffering. The countless masses are in a hell of hunger, drowning, axes, and drills. We hope that you will uphold the grand aspiration of the compassionate ship and universally liberate them to reach the other shore. Relieving the suffering of the masses is the supreme method. We earnestly request that you consider reducing the rents in various locations of the Hardoon estate, which would conform to the Buddhist teaching of benefiting all beings and the principle of all dharmas returning to oneness. If you could spread the willow branch and make the earth and sky seem vast, and we could appease your heart by pleading for the people, we would bow our heads, put our palms together, and pray, respectfully awaiting your teachings to alleviate our thirst for revival.</p>
<h3>Establishment of a Branch of the World Peace Prayer Society in Paris, France</h3>
<p>The World Peace Prayer Society, promoting the true meaning of Confucius's Great Harmony, has been initiated at the Peng Road location in this city. In less than half a year since its inception, celebrities from both Chinese and foreign circles have successively responded and joined the society as initiators and sponsors. The development of the society's affairs is truly astonishing.</p>
<p>It is now learned that Dr. Beauvais and others have formed the Paris branch of the society in Paris, France. The first to sign in approval include Father Kim, an important figure in the Catholic Church, the current Minister of the Navy, Pierre Étienne Flandin, the Inspector General of the Ministry of Education, Garrier, and five or six hundred other well-known figures from various circles. It is also learned that the French President, the President of the Parliament, the Pope of Rome, and the Italian Prime Minister, Benito Mussolini, are also preparing to participate.</p>
<p>Dr. Beauvais enjoys a considerable reputation in French society, hence this achievement. In the future, the Great Way will spread to the West, and world peace will depend on this society as a ray of hope. According to the person in charge of the society, they plan to invite Master Duan Zhengyuan to Shanghai soon to give speeches on the true meaning of the Great Harmony and to pray for world peace. Master Duan is truly a prophet and visionary of modern times, and all his predictions have come true. The intellectual community greatly admires him.</p>
<h3>Woman Zhang Qiaozhen Sues Wang Wenda for Rape</h3>
<p>Postponed for Further Investigation and Trial</p>
<p>Hu Zhucheng, a Ningbo native who works as a teacher at Chonggong Elementary School on Xiaoshadu Road in West Shanghai, married Zhang Qiaozhen, a woman from the same hometown, through a matchmaker three years ago. In July of last year, Wang Wen Da, who worked at Hongshun Foreign Firm on Jiangxi Road, met Zhang Qiaozhen at a playground. They fell in love at first sight and often went out together. Recently, Zhang Qiaozhen reported to the Public Security Bureau that Wang Wen Da had raped her. Wang Wen Da was arrested and handed over to the Local Court because the case involved morality. Prosecutor Du Jiasheng interrogated him and released him on bail. After repeated investigations, he was indicted on charges of disrupting the family. Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, Judge Chen Kangsun specially opened the Fifth Court for trial.</p>
<p>First, the plaintiff Zhang Qiaozhen testified: I am 20 years old and live at 37 Yuezhou Road. (Question) What are you accusing Wang Wen Da of? (Answer) Wang borrowed 20 yuan from me. I have been pressing him for a long time without success, so I am suing him. (Answer) Why are you accusing him of disrupting the family over a visit to the Da Fang Hotel last July or August? (Answer) Last July or August, Wang wanted to rape me at the Da Fang Hotel. (Question) Did you and Wang stay overnight together? (Answer) No. (Question) Why did you go to the Da Fang Hotel? (Answer) To ask Wang Wen Da for money. (Question) Has this money been returned to you? (Answer) No.</p>
<p>Next, Zhang Yinshi testified: I am 39 years old, a Shanghai native, and live at 3 Wang Yi Ma Lane, No. 3. My husband is a coppersmith. (Question) Who is Zhang Qiaozhen to you? (Answer) My biological daughter. (Question) Has Qiaozhen been married? (Answer) She married a man surnamed Hu three years ago. (Question) What are you accusing Wang Wen Da of? (Answer) I am not accusing him. (Question) Who wrote the complaint? (Answer) I don't know. (Question) What exactly did your daughter quarrel with Wang Wen Da about? (Answer) I don't know.</p>
<p>Finally, Wang Wen Da testified: I am 28 years old, a Ningbo native, and live at 3 Xilin Road, outside Ximen in the South City. (Question) Briefly explain the facts of the crime that happened last July or August. Briefly, Wang Wen Da actually committed the crime under Article 275, Section 2. During the investigation, the plaintiff Zhang Qiaozhen stated that she was a woman under the legal age who was forced into illicit relations by the defendant Wang Wen Da. She never stated that she was already married to Hu Zhu. The defendant also admitted to opening the Da Fang Hotel, and Zhang Qiaozhen also stated that she went to the Da Fang Hotel, etc. The judge believed that the case needed further investigation and postponed the trial. The defendant Wang Wen Da remained on bail.</p>
<h3>Autopsy of a Female Hostess</h3>
<p>Xu Meiying, a 28-year-old Jiangwan woman who worked as a hostess in the Daxing Class at the Xinxin Company amusement park, residing on the third floor of Yuanshenchang Porcelain Shop, No. 88 Jin Shenfu Road, French Concession, was found dead between 9 and 10 a.m. one day. A man wearing short clothes, about 30 years old, went to her residence and strangled her with a woman's trouser belt before fleeing. At noon, her lover, Gu Xiaodi, returned home and discovered the crime. Gold bracelets, rings, and ornaments worth over 400 yuan, as well as dozens of yuan in cash, were stolen. He immediately reported to the French police, who sent detectives to investigate and transported the body to the morgue for an autopsy. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, the police reported to the Special Second Court, which appointed Prosecutor Wang Ren, along with a forensic doctor and a clerk, to conduct the autopsy at noon. The autopsy revealed that Xu Meiying had indeed been strangled to death before she died. Gu Xiaodi claimed the body for burial. The police are investigating the case and will bring the perpetrators to justice. It is also reported that according to the second landlord, the murderer resembled a local man surnamed Shen, but his name was unknown. Before the incident, he had repeatedly visited Gu's house and stolen seven yuan from the deceased. He also wanted to invite Gu Xiaodi to work in Nanjing, but the deceased found out and stopped him. Gu and Shen went to Nanjing, and Shen later borrowed money from the deceased but was refused. It is believed that these grievances led to the murder.</p>

<h3>Lin Su, a Student at the Customs Taxation School, Commits Suicide Due to Mental Derangement</h3>
<p>Depressed Due to Repeated Exam Failures</p>
<p>Nervous Breakdown Due to Excessive Studying for the Upcoming Preliminary Exam</p>
<p>Lin Su, a young student from Guangdong, 21 years old, currently a third-year student at the Customs Taxation School at No. 200 Yao Bishop Road in the French Concession, boarded and lodged at the school in Dormitory No. 2 on the second floor. After graduation, he would be selected by the Customs Department to serve as a customs officer in various customs offices. Lin was diligent in his studies, but due to his slow intellect, he repeatedly failed the exams and fell behind. As a result, he was constantly depressed and unhappy. Now, with the preliminary exam approaching, he worked hard but was still worried about failing, leading to overexertion of his brain and mental derangement. Recently, he experienced even more stimulation and suddenly had the thought of ending his life.</p>
<p>One night, at 1:45 a.m. (i.e., on the morning of the 2nd), Lin suddenly got out of bed, went to the kitchen, grabbed a kitchen knife, ran to the rooftop on the second floor, and slashed his neck with the knife, cutting his throat. The wound was about an inch deep. He collapsed in pain. His roommates, Fu Yukui (26 years old, from Beiping) and Yang Junmu (22 years old, from Guangdong), were startled by a loud noise on the rooftop in their sleep. They got up and went outside to check, and saw Lin lying in a pool of blood with blood gushing from the wound. They were greatly alarmed and woke up the other students and rushed to the General Affairs Section to report the incident. They hired a car to send Lin to the General Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross on Haig Road for treatment, but due to the severity of the injury, he died shortly after.</p>
<p>They reported to the French police, who sent detectives to investigate. They also sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-Morgue for an autopsy and reported to the Prosecutor's Office of the Special Second District Court to appoint Prosecutor Wang Ren, forensic doctor Wei Ligong, and clerk Peng Yi to inspect the body at noon. The deceased had a bald head, wore a brown velvet Western-style shirt, a wool sweater, a white broadcloth shirt, black serge Western-style trousers, and white canvas sneakers. Blood was still oozing from the wound, and his face and hands were covered in blood. It was a tragic sight.</p>
<p>The officials sat in court, and both Chinese and Western detectives reported the case and the investigation process, and presented the murder weapon. The officials questioned Fu and Yang about the discovery and the deceased's recent circumstances. Lin's fellow student Zhang Runfu from the same hometown stated that the deceased's family was still in his hometown, and he had sent a telegram to inform them. He was willing to be responsible for claiming the body and arranging the burial. The officials ruled that Lin Su had died from a throat injury caused by a knife. The body was allowed to be claimed by Zhang Runfu for burial.</p>

<h3>The Latest Domestically Produced Fire Engine Arrived in Caojiadu Yesterday</h3>
<p>Director Xi Yuqing of the Caojiadu Fire Brigade had previously noted that the western Shanghai area was vast, with many factories, and the firefighting equipment was mostly old and dilapidated. He was always uneasy whenever a fire broke out. Last winter, he consulted with the Third District Branch of the Municipal Citizens' Association to discuss purchasing new fire engines. With the permission of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Fire Department and the approval of the Municipal Government, it was decided to add two new fire engines. In addition to the 2,000 yuan raised locally, the remaining funds were allocated from the municipal treasury.</p>
<p>It is now reported that the new fire engine, designed in detail by the Municipal Fire Department, was manufactured by Hengda Machinery Factory, a Chinese-owned enterprise. The Damont type fire engine weighs three tons, is 26 feet long, and over 10 feet high. The ladder is 48 feet high and has three sections. Yesterday morning, it paraded along Bailinan Road, Jessfield Road, and Robison Road. Shops along the way set off firecrackers to welcome it, making it very lively. In the afternoon, it went to the Shanghai West Railway Station and demonstrated a water spray height of 15 feet. Director Yu and all members of the brigade expressed satisfaction. The second new Ketterel type fire engine will be completed by the end of this month. Once it is ready, Mayor Wu will hold a grand completion ceremony. The two fire engines cost a total of 18,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Weather in This City is Mild and Pleasant</h3>
<p>Insects Awaken on the Fifth, the Jingzhe Festival</p>
<p>Pay Attention to Pest Control in the Fields</p>
<p>The weather in this city has been cloudy and hazy in recent days, with very low air pressure, leading to frequent heavy fog, making breathing difficult. Epidemics such as diphtheria and measles have suddenly broken out. However, since the day before yesterday, the weather has cleared up, and the cloudy haze has been swept away. Furthermore, the weather is unusually warm, and citizens have replaced their fur coats with cotton-padded jackets, fully demonstrating the spirit of spring.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the fifth of this month is the Jingzhe Festival, when all insects awaken. Due to the warm and humid weather of the past few days, and the rain and snow in early spring, pests are bound to breed in the fields. Therefore, farmers should start pest control work at this time to avoid harming the harvest.</p>
<h3>A Page from the Love Story of a Russian and a German Wife</h3>
<p>The Man and Woman Had Been to Qingdao Together</p>
<p>Arrested and Escorted Back to Shanghai for Theft</p>
<p>Russian national Vladimir Mentchougloff (formerly known as the leader of the International Kidnapping Gang), a dentist at 83 Beijing Road (34 years old), met the wife of German national Harsdörffer, living at 612 Enbrook Building, North Suzhou Road, in April of last year when she sought treatment for a toothache. They fell in love. Later, Mentchougloff moved to 1081 North Sichuan Road, and Mrs. Harsdörffer often visited him for chats. On January 10th of this year, the woman and a daughter went to Qingdao with Mentchougloff, carrying many pieces of luggage, without informing her husband (Harsdörffer works at the Syme &amp; Co. Foreign Firm).</p>
<p>Her husband returned home and discovered that a gold ingot worth 7,390 yuan, weighing 70 taels, 43 Japanese gold coins, and two American gold coins, which were hidden in the drawer of a desk in the bedroom, were missing. The drawer showed no signs of forced entry. He reported the incident to the Hongkou Police Station, which obtained an arrest warrant from the First Special District Court and apprehended them in Dalian. They were brought back to Shanghai on the Shanghai Maru and detained at the Hongkou Police Station. They were charged with theft under Article 337, Section 1 of the Criminal Code. The defendant denied stealing the items. The court ordered that Harsdörffer's wife, who had been detained by the Public Security Bureau in Qingdao, be brought to court to testify. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yinghua convened a continued hearing in the Fifth Criminal Court.</p>
<p>Police lawyer Jiang Baolian stated the case, and said that the plaintiff's wife and a Chinese man named Zhang Zifu were present, and could prove everything. Mrs. Harsdörffer, 31 years old, who returned from Qingdao yesterday, testified that she met the defendant in April of last year when she was treated for a dental illness. She saw the gold ingot and Japanese and American gold coins in her husband's drawer in October and found it strange. She mentioned it to the defendant, but her husband kept the drawer key, and the defendant did not know her address, so he had never been to her house. It was not until the third of this month that she learned that she had forgotten a handbag containing a key to the main door at his place in December and had not retrieved it. She had been planning to return to her home country, but her husband did not agree. This time, because of the funeral of Mayers, the director of Syme &amp; Co., she decided to return to her home country for a trip. On the eighth of last month, she discussed it with the defendant, who promised to give her travel expenses and send her to Harbin. Therefore, on the morning of the ninth, when her husband was not at home, she had him hire a car to her door. She had him take away a handbag and a hatbox. The next morning, she left with her daughter and him, first going to Qingdao. She had no knowledge of his theft and did not ask him to do such things.</p>
<p>The local man Zhang Zifu testified that he used to work as a cook at the defendant's place. At the end of last year, he saw him holding a key that looked like the one presented in court and working on it with a file. He asked him what it was for, and he said that he had lost a mailbox key and was making a replacement. He did not know anything else. The owner of the stolen goods, Harsdörffer, testified that although his wife had seen the drawer key, he always kept it in his waistcoat pocket and never gave it to her. Sometimes he put it in a tin box in a small room, but he would usually change clothes and forget to take it out. After a while, he would realize it and put it back in safekeeping.</p>
<p>When questioned, the defendant firmly denied stealing the items and hired a lawyer to request bail to avoid wrongful imprisonment. Judge Xiang granted the request and ordered the defendant to post a cash bail of 7,390 yuan and adjourned the case for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Jin Menggen, Who Was Assassinated, Needs an Autopsy to Retrieve the Bullet</h3>
<p>The Family Cannot Bear It and Firmly Requests Exemption from Autopsy</p>
<p>Jin Menggen, who opened a teahouse in Zhoujiaqiao, West Shanghai, was friends with Wang Xinshan, who lived nearby. However, they had different opinions and were mutually suspicious. In the winter of the year before last, they jointly opened the Yongle Tanhuang Theater, but there were conflicts over changing the acting troupe. In the first month of the lunar calendar last year, Wang had people disrupt the theater, and Jin drove them away on the spot. Wang Xinshan was very dissatisfied and knew that Jin Menggen carried a birdcage outside every morning. Therefore, he instructed Zhang Pengfei and A Er to lie in wait near Hopeland Road with guns on the morning of June 10th at about 5 a.m.</p>
<p>Soon they saw Jin walking past with a birdcage. Zhang and others opened fire and shot Jin down. Jin's wife, Ms. Bao, heard the news at home and rushed to the scene. Jin was still able to speak and named the murderers in a broken voice. He died shortly after. Afterwards, Jin's wives, Ms. Bao and Ms. Liu, reported the incident to the Sixth District Police Station, which arrested Wang Xinshan and handed him over to the Nanshi Local Court. The court sent personnel to conduct an autopsy. As a result, Wang Xinshan was sentenced to death for premeditated murder. Wang appealed to the Jiangsu High Court, which ordered Wang to be taken to Suzhou for interrogation.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, Judge Shao Qinzhi of the Local Court specially opened the Third Court and ordered Jin Bao and Jin Zhang to appear in court. (Question) How did your husband Jin Menggen die? (Answer) He was shot and killed by Wang Xinshan. (Question) Do you know the current status of the case? (Answer) Because Wang Xinshan did not accept the verdict, he was taken to Suzhou and is currently being tried by the High Court. (Question) Because the bullet fired into your husband's abdomen has not been removed, this court intends to send your husband's coffin to the Zhenru Forensic Institute to extract the bullet for research. Upon hearing this, Jin Bao and others replied, "My husband suffered a tragic gunshot death and died miserably. Please ask the presiding judge to exempt us from the autopsy." The judge said, "Could it be that you have already reached an agreement outside?" The two women replied together, "There has been no contact. We request an exemption from the autopsy because we really cannot bear to move the body again. We have no other intention." The judge, upon hearing their testimony, ordered them to leave and await instructions.</p>
<h3>Wife Commits Suicide Due to Husband's Unemployment</h3>
<p>The Hardships of Life Are Too Horrific to Describe</p>
<p>Zhang Zishi, a 37-year-old woman from Xinghua, lived at No. 604 Taihe Lane, Xiaoshadu Road. Her husband, Zhang Dixin, used to work in a silk factory, but had been unemployed for over a year. The family's livelihood depended on Ms. Zhang's work at the Meifeng Silk Weaving Factory, but her income was meager, leading to extreme financial difficulties and frequent threats of running out of food. Ms. Zhang, seeing that her husband had no suitable employment, thought about the long days ahead and how to survive. Out of resentment, she suddenly had the thought of ending her life and secretly swallowed opium to kill herself. Her husband discovered it and reported to the Gordon Road Police Station, which sent Detective Tao Afu to investigate. They sent her to Guangren Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective. She died at about 3 a.m. yesterday.</p>
<p>The body was transported to the Pailon Road Morgue. At about 10 a.m., Prosecutor Song Gengshan, appointed by the First Special District Local Court, arrived at the morgue to examine the body. After hearing Zhang Dixin's statement of the events, Prosecutor Song ruled that the deceased Zhang Zishi, a female, had indeed died from opium poisoning.

<h3>Dredging Copper Sand and Shuan Sand Waterways</h3>
<p>Customs House Installs Buoy Lights to Indicate Navigation Routes</p>
<p>The Copper Sand Waterway and the Shuan Sand Waterway of the Yangtze River's southern channel are currently being dredged. As the Jianghai Customs considers this area a crucial navigation channel, it has added buoy lights to indicate the routes. The decided additions are: (1) An upstream buoy light, decorated in red, flashing a white light every eight seconds (four seconds on, four seconds off). This is to guide upstream vessels to navigate the right side of the waterway. It is located at 240 degrees north of the Nanhuizhuang, a distance of 7.15 nautical miles.

<h3>French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association Protests Detectives' Abuse of Power</h3>
<p>Yesterday Sent Letter to Police Commissioner Requesting Thorough Investigation and Reply</p>
<p>Search Warrants Should Be Obtained from the Court for Searches</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association, acting on behalf of the Fourth District Branch of the Second Special District Citizens United Association, reported that Mr. Dong Wenli, a Standing Committee member, was falsely accused by a French police Inspector Qian, who incited an apprentice to harm a legitimate merchant. Yesterday, they sent a letter to the French Police Commissioner protesting and requesting a thorough investigation and reply. The original text is recorded below: To the esteemed Commissioner: We received a letter dated February 17th from the Fourth District Branch of the Second Special District Citizens United Association stating that Mr. Wang Lianqing of Wang Shunqing Wood Shop at 206 Pingji Road reported that on the night of the 13th of this month at 8 p.m., a large number of French police detectives suddenly searched the shop, claiming to be catching gamblers. At the time, four tenants were playing mahjong upstairs. The detectives searched upstairs but found nothing. They told the four people that playing mahjong was not an arrestable offense, but shortly after leaving, they returned and arrested all four of them. They also dragged Wang Wenqing, an apprentice who was already in bed, out of bed. Chinese Inspector Qian Chenglong threatened him with a gun, ordering the apprentice to reveal the gambling den. The apprentice said he didn't know, so he was beaten and kicked arbitrarily. Subsequently, the group was detained in the police station. The apprentice was locked in a room and incited to confess that Dong Wenli ran a gambling den, and then released, the apprentice, being ignorant, could only say yes or no. The next day, the five men were released. At the same time, Mr. Dong Wenli, a Standing Committee member of this association, also reported that the police had sent detectives to search and monitor his activities and requested us to negotiate reasonably. Based on this, our association conducted a detailed investigation and convened an emergency meeting. It was agreed that the French police often base searches of residences on anonymous letters. If they find nothing, they arbitrarily insult people. If they find something, they exaggerate the matter and ensure that the person is convicted. It is requested that a letter be forwarded to the Second Special District Court so that in the future, the French police must obtain a search warrant from the court before conducting a search to prevent citizens from being disturbed without reason and from being framed. As for Inspector Qian Chenglong leading detectives to search shops, treating mahjong as gambling, arbitrarily arresting ignorant apprentices, and falsely accusing legitimate merchants, and subsequently fabricating various charges in order to trap Mr. Dong, such abuse of power is lawless. It is requested that a letter be forwarded to the French Chief Secretary General requesting a thorough investigation to ensure the safety of merchants. If there is no response, it is requested that a letter be forwarded to the French Consul General to order an investigation. In addition to sending letters to various groups requesting assistance, a letter is being sent to your association to request negotiation. The letter arrived at the association more than ten days ago. The association believes that the case is significant and has conducted repeated detailed investigations. According to reports from various parties, the case involves fabricated facts and false accusations against merchants. If it is not investigated truthfully, the citizens of the concession will inevitably be in a state of constant fear. Based on the above investigation, we urgently write to your esteemed Commissioner, requesting a thorough investigation and requesting a detailed report of the investigation to be forwarded so that we can inform the relevant parties. To the Police Commissioner of the French Concession.</p>

<h3>Change of Director at Zhabei Civilian Education Center</h3>
<p>New Director's Inauguration Ceremony Held Yesterday</p>
<p>The Zhabei Liuying Road Civilian Education Center, under the Shanghai Local Association, was transferred to the Chinese Children's Welfare Association last autumn due to financial difficulties. The temporary takeover period is set for two years, during which the association has full authority to manage and reorganize the center. At the end of the period, if both parties agree, the arrangement may continue. The association's Executive Committee, considering that the majority of the center's students are children under the age of 20, which falls within the association's scope of relief, appointed Wang Guanyi, a staff member of the Protection Group, to serve concurrently as the director of the education center. It also elected three executive committee members, Lin Kanghou, Ding Shujing, and Li Tingan, to serve as members of the Education Center Management Committee, with full authority to handle all matters. Director Wang Guanyi assumed office on August 1st of last year, and more than half a year has passed in a flash. Recently, the Management Committee members held a meeting and unanimously agreed that Wang Guanyi's concurrent position as director of the education center was inappropriate as it meant abandoning his original child protection duties. Therefore, it was decided to replace Wang Guanyi and appoint Wang Zhenchang as the director of the education center. This decision was formally approved by the Executive Committee. Wang Zhenchang immediately went to the center yesterday to take over. At 10 a.m., the new director's inauguration ceremony was held. Attendees included Executive Committee member Lin Kanghou, Deputy Secretary-General Chen Tiesheng, staff members Zhang Yueru, Liu Yide, Zhao Jian, and over 150 teachers, staff, and students. Lin Kanghou led the meeting as usual and delivered a speech, stating that the Civilian Education Center has a glorious history and expressed hope that the new director and all teachers and staff would work together harmoniously and in unity, following the right principles. He also hoped that all students would be mindful of the sincerity and dedication of the management and strive to improve themselves so that the future development would be promising and that they would not disappoint the expectations of the Chinese Children's Welfare Association and the Shanghai Local Association. After the speech, Director Wang Zhenchang gave a reply. Tea and photography followed, and the meeting adjourned at 12 o'clock.</p>

<h3>1935 Buick Automobile Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Buick automobile, praised by everyone, has arrived in Shanghai in its 1935 model. It is on display at the Ximolu Xintong Automobile Company. You are welcome to visit and test drive it. Its beautiful style, comfortable ride, and ease of driving are unmatched by other vehicles. General Motors conducted meticulous and thorough research when manufacturing the Buick automobile and widely solicited opinions from all walks of life on the style of the car. Therefore, the 1934 model was loved at first sight, which was not accidental. The increasing sales in recent years further prove that the meticulous research was valuable. In addition, after a public solicitation by General Motors' research investigators, people generally called the Buick automobile "reasonably priced and exceptionally beautiful." It is said that during the investigation, women generally said that the Buick automobile's style was beautiful, which was on par with its reliability and long life. Not only that, but experts in car styling also said that the Buick automobile's style matches Buick's inherent reputation and can truly satisfy people. Its generous appearance, beauty, and durability make the Buick automobile seamless and perfect. Therefore, the Buick automobile of today is predicted to be popular for four years without decline. The Buick automobile's perfect appearance is praiseworthy, and the interior is also very spacious and has various convenient facilities. The curtains are made of special materials, and the colors are very harmonious. The equipment such as handles, belts, carpets, lights, and ashtrays make the 1935 Buick automobile most suitable for women. Its various facilities make riding in a Buick exceptionally comfortable and convenient. In addition to its beautiful interior and exterior and complete equipment, the Buick automobile's ease of driving is even more outstanding, making the driver feel effortless and very excited. For example, dealing with traffic jams is easy, and there are other automatic mechanisms to help reduce labor. When starting the car, you only need to start the ignition and then operate the car by hand without using your feet. Moreover, the view forward from the driving position is always clear. In short, the Buick automobile is the most complete and worthwhile car to buy among the new cars of 1935. It is expected that after it begins to be displayed, people who need a car that is truly worth the money will flock to it and seek it eagerly.</p>
<h3>Suicide at Yong'an Hotel</h3>
<p>A Suicide Note Claimed Overwhelming Debt</p>
<p>A traveler came to the Yong'an Hotel on Maigen Road at around 4 p.m. the day before yesterday and said he wanted to stay. The hotel accountant led him to Room 30. The guest claimed to be named Ying San囡, from Changzhou, 36 years old, and engaged in the tricycle business. He closed the door and went to sleep that night without any other abnormalities. Unexpectedly, at around 11 a.m. yesterday morning, the hotel tea server knocked on the door to ask if the room was still needed when he suddenly heard a moaning sound from inside. He became suspicious and pushed the door open. He saw Ying San囡 lying across the bed, his face pale and blood frothing from his mouth. He pushed him but could not wake him up. Knowing that something had happened, he quickly reported to the local police station, which sent a car to rush him to Renji Hospital for treatment. It was learned that he had taken poison. However, due to the excessive amount, his life was in danger. Afterwards, the police found a suicide note next to him, addressed to Ying's mother-in-law, who lives in the Qinkong Umbrella Factory in Yongji Lane on Xin Zha Road in this city. The letter stated that he was in overwhelming debt and unable to repay it, so he had no choice but to commit suicide.</p>

<h3>Police Chief Courageously Captures Three Thieves in Theft on MacLeod Road</h3>
<p>The Zhonghua Drilling Company on MacLeod Road in Huxi was founded by an American. The area is remote and sparsely populated, surrounded by wilderness, making it a target for thieves. Thefts have occurred repeatedly last winter. At 3:30 a.m. the day before yesterday, seven or eight thieves suddenly arrived, each holding iron bars and bamboo poles, and smashed the company's gate. They then rushed in, intending to start looting. Fortunately, Police Chief Liu Shaoquan of the local guard station happened to be patrolling with his police officers. When the thieves saw the police arrive, they knew they had failed and immediately retreated and fled. The police bravely went forward to pursue them. Unexpectedly, the thieves dared to resist arrest, and a rain of clubs and poles fell. Police Chief Liu was seriously injured in the left arm. The police arrested three thieves and took them to the Pusong Police Station. Dong, the station chief, interrogated the thieves. One, Li Hujin, one, Feng Jisheng, and one, Shen Litang, all confessed to conspiring to commit robbery and resisting arrest, and injuring the police chief.

<h3>Husband Has Hidden Illness, Wife Seeks Divorce</h3>
<p>Xu Yonghuang, a 21-year-old Suzhou native residing at 339, Lane 689, Zhaofeng Road, Hongkou, married Fu Juying, a woman from Yuyao, through a matchmaker. The wedding ceremony was held on December 2nd of last year at the Xin Xin Restaurant, with Le Zhenbao, a well-known businessman, as the witness. Unexpectedly, after living together, Fu discovered that her husband suffered from a hidden illness, and she became unhappy and resentful. As a result, the relationship between the two deteriorated. The woman returned to her parents' home before a month had passed. Recently, she hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Local Court, requesting a divorce. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Qiao Wanxuan held a hearing. The plaintiff did not appear. According to her lawyer, the marriage between the plaintiff and the defendant was solely arranged by the plaintiff's uncle, Fu Yuxiang, because he had a close relationship with the defendant's father. He sacrificed his niece for this relationship. The lawyer said that after the plaintiff married, she immediately discovered that the defendant had a hidden illness, which caused her deep resentment. The defendant repeatedly abused her with his parents, making it difficult for the plaintiff to live with him. After she returned to her mother's home, the defendant came to threaten her. Therefore, she had no choice but to file for divorce. However, the defendant Xu Yonghuang denied all three accusations made by the plaintiff: that he suffered from a hidden illness, repeatedly abused her, and frequently threatened her. He also filed a counterclaim, requesting that the court order them to live together. Judge Qiao believed that since the plaintiff had not appeared in court in person, it was not easy to understand the facts, so he postponed the hearing and ordered the plaintiff to appear in court for further questioning.</p>

Several hundred natives of Zhongshan with both reputation and popularity in Shanghai have been hired to serve as captains of the solicitation teams, and a general headquarters for membership solicitation has been established within the association's premises on Qiujiang Road in Zhabei. The solicitation work has begun and is extremely intense. According to the plan, there are two types of memberships: Type A members pay an admission fee of five yuan, and Type B members pay one yuan.

<h3>Skota Cup Semi-Final Replay: Tung Wah Eliminated Lux</h3>
<p>3-2</p>
<p>Winning the Right to Play French Club in the Final</p>
<p>Both Sides Perform Extremely Well</p>
<p>Over Ten Thousand People at the Recreation Ground Cheer Enthusiastically</p>
<p>The Skota Cup semi-final replay between Tung Wah and Lux, after a 2-2 draw the previous week, was fiercely contested again yesterday at the Recreation Ground. Tung Wah finally eliminated Lux with a score of 3-2, winning the right to play the French Club in the final. Yesterday, the spring sunshine was bright, and the weather was mild. No less than ten thousand people, both men and women, were in the stands at the Recreation Ground, all cheering enthusiastically and gleefully.</p>
<p>Tung Wah Players Give Their All</p>
<p>Tung Wah had been conserving their energy for a long time and were in high spirits with a neat military appearance. Although Guan Xun'an had not returned from the Fudan expedition to the north, and Chen Hongguang was unable to rush back in time, their strength was not affected. Moreover, Feng Yunyou gave an especially strong performance, looking ahead and behind, responding to all sides, and running tirelessly. Except for Wan Xianghua, who was slightly lacking, the five forwards all worked hard, giving their all. Jia Youliang's right wing had reached the point of perfection, sending out many brilliant balls and giving Dai Li many opportunities. However, Lu Zhongen's carelessness caused an accident, leading to the tense situation of 3-2.</p>
<p>Lux Put on a Deep Performance</p>
<p>Lux were all young and brave generals, with talent just like Tung Wah. Recently, they had been winning every game. Even the Western police acknowledged their defeat. They were generally recognized as the only strong team among Westerners. After drawing 2-2 with Tung Wah the previous week, they were ambitious and hoped to win the Skota Cup. Therefore, when old enemies met again, a fierce battle was inevitable. Sure enough, they were the first to break through Tung Wah's defense, but in the end, they were defeated by a difference of one goal. The performances of Rumons, H. Mada, Bosalie, and goalkeeper Kokren were commendable and gave the audience a deep impression.</p>
<p>Bosalie Actually Scores First</p>
<p>After the two teams were photographed, Tung Wah kicked off from the east to attack. The spectators cheered wildly, and the atmosphere in the stadium was very tense. Feng Yunyou kicked a free kick, forcing it to the baseline. Wan Xianghua sent out a corner kick, and Chen Jia's header was cleverly caught by Kokren. Tung Wah continued to attack fiercely, and the situation in front of Lux's goal was precarious. Li Yichen and Dai Linjing made several attempts to score, but they were unsuccessful. After Lux overcame the difficulties, they suddenly became like unbridled horses, moving straight ahead and launching an offensive. The forwards were extremely fast, and Tung Wah's hinterland was in great urgency. Bosalie appeared and disappeared unpredictably, entering every gap. Lu Zhongen failed to save the ball, and Little Bao caught up and kicked it into the net. Tung Wah was actually the first to lose a goal.</p>
<p>Li Yichen Returns the Favor</p>
<p>Since Tung Wah had lost the first goal, the spectators were all shocked. Even the Tung Wah players were like frightened birds. Fortunately, their military appearance was neat and orderly, and they were careful. Jia Youliang sent a high ball from the boundary, and Dai Linjing responded in the center, attacking the goal unsuccessfully. Feng Yunyou made a comeback, and the high ball was picked up and passed over Jia Youliang's head. Li Yichen got what he wanted and shot at the goal, establishing a great feat and creating a tie. The audience was filled with joy again, and the atmosphere turned milder. But from then on, the competitive situation became even more intense.</p>
<p>Two to One, Tung Wah Takes the Lead</p>
<p>The connection between the two teams was good, and their actions were fast. It was truly a rare and wonderful game. Lux tried hard to attack, and the three forwards were extremely hardworking, but the two wings were slightly weak. Based on the mistakes of the past, Tung Wah built high walls and deep trenches, paying special attention to defense. Therefore, Lux's several attempts to probe were unsuccessful. Wan Xianghua stole in along the side and shot, but it was caught. Feng Yunyou got the ball and passed it to Jia Youliang, who crossed from the baseline. Li Yichen forwarded it to Dai Linjing. A'Dai aimed at the enemy's goal and built another achievement. Thus, they turned defeat into victory, and the first half ended with a score of 2-1.</p>
<p>Li Yichen Creates Three to One</p>
<p>After the break, Lux tried to win with surprise tactics, but after T. Mada's corner kick failed, Tung Wah was given the opportunity to attack. Dai Linjing led the army forward. Jia Youliang dribbled the ball deep into the side of the goal, but he was too close and could not use it. After more than ten minutes, Lux's actions were slightly out of order. Tung Wah did not take it to heart and fought calmly. Jia Youliang passed a ball, Dai Linjing feinted, and Li Yichen shot it in, making it 3-1. Tung Wah then occupied an extremely advantageous position.</p>
<p>Lux's Last Struggle</p>
<p>Lux's arrogance declined slightly, and Tung Wah's limelight was strong. It seemed that they could rest easy. Li Yichen got the ball from Youliang and flew it into the sky, missing the opportunity. Lux attacked several times, but there was no way in. After a long battle, Simmons struggled hard to create an opportunity. Bosalie was eager to try, but he failed to score several times. Later, due to A'Lu's carelessness, Bao was finally able to build another achievement, ending the game with a score of 3-2. The players from both teams were as follows:</p>
<p>Tung Wah Club</p>
<p>Lu Zhongen, Li Ning, Chen Gongyu, Gu Shangxiang, Feng Yunyou, Ding Zhaocheng, Wan Xianghua, Li Yichen, Dai Linjing, Chen Jiaqiu, Jia Youliang</p>
<p>Lux</p>
<p>W. Kokren, Logan, Stand, Guglif, Simmons, H. Mada, Lian, Bosalie, H. Kokren, Atig, T. Mada</p>
<h3>International Basketball First Game: China Loses to the United States</h3>
<p>The Strength of the United States is Unprecedented</p>
<p>China Remains the Same, Unable to Do Anything</p>
<p>The Result is 57 to 31</p>
<p>This year's Shanghai International Basketball Tournament was disappointing because the women's tournament was suspended due to inconsistent rules. In the men's group, only China and the United States adopted a best-of-three series to determine the winner. China was far from being a match for the United States, which can be said to be extremely disappointing. The sluggishness of the basketball world is lamentable. But comparatively speaking, Chinese basketball skills are not weaker than in previous years. It is only because the American team's basketball skills have improved a lot, resulting in a huge gap. In the first game between China and the United States last night, China lost 31-57. In the first half, the United States scored 31 points, while China only scored 8 points.</p>
<p>The Strongest Lineup in Shanghai</p>
<p>The American team used West Qing Shi Misi, Ranyi, and Karl Sen as three, and Si Jia, with Mai Ling, Lek, and Boli Shi as two capable generals. Such a strong lineup is unprecedented in Shanghai. The accuracy of shooting, the beauty of the connection, and the strictness of the defense are truly admirable. It is no wonder that the Chinese team was at a loss and acknowledged defeat.</p>
<p>China Can Do Nothing</p>
<p>Comparatively speaking, the Chinese lineup was more organized with Feng Nianhua and Qian Jingyong as the two forwards, Lu Zhongen and Sun Baoqing as the guards, and Xu Heng as the center. Chen Zongqi's inner guard can replace Sun Baoqing, but the various aspects of the connection are slightly lacking. Qian Jingyong's basketball skills are far from what they used to be. Feng Nianhua and Sun Baoqing are as they were in the past. Lu Zhongen's prestige is still not reduced, and it is still up to him to command everything.</p>
<p>Only One Shot Made</p>
<p>After the start, the United States came out with a formal lineup, leaving China with no way out and unable to do anything. After four to zero, Sun Baoqing scored the only goal in the first half. After that, it became ten to two. China scored three points by free throws, making it ten to five. Until twenty-six to five, the United States repeatedly changed players. In addition to Sun scoring one goal, China scored six points from free throws. The first half ended with China trailing 8-31.</p>
<p>The Final Situation is Average</p>
<p>Starting in the second half, the American lineup was greatly adjusted. Only Smith of the official personnel remained. After Lu Zhongen scored two consecutive goals, the momentum rose. After that, both sides made progress, and the situation became balanced. Thirty-seven to seventeen, forty-one to twenty-three. This was the closest period of the score. The United States again greatly adjusted its personnel, and the initial five players came on the field again, but the situation was far less tense than before. China also occasionally scored, but in the end, China still lost by as much as twenty-six points, with a score of 31-57. The referees were Zhang Guoxun and Hall. The second game is scheduled for 8 PM on the afternoon of the 6th at the Shen Garden.</p>
<p>United States: Shots, Free Throws, Fouls, Points; China: Shots, Free Throws, Fouls, Points</p>

<h3>International Olympic Committee Passes Locations for the Next Three Meetings</h3>
<p>Requests All Countries Not to Award Cash Prizes to Athletes</p>
<p>(Havas Agency, Oslo, 1st) The International Olympic Committee has recently decided that the next three meetings will be held in Berlin in 1936, Warsaw in 1937, and Cairo, Egypt in 1938. The committee, having heard that some countries intend to award cash prizes to the winners, discussed this matter especially today. It was decided to request that the Olympic Committees of all countries not implement this fact, as athletes will lose their amateur status once they accept cash. Regarding the location of the 1940 Olympic Games, the Italian representative did withdraw the request to hold them in Rome at today's meeting, but the situation is still chaotic, as representatives of most of the non-attending countries have already voted, and some of them must have voted for Italy. The chairman of the International Olympic Committee, Belgian representative Berela, did not want the committee's decision to be seen as a political compromise, and proposed to postpone the decision on the location of the 1940 Olympic Games until the International Committee meets in Berlin next year. All the committee members, except for the representative of one country who abstained, expressed their approval, and this proposal was finally passed.</p>

Yesterday's match resulted in a 1-1 tie in the first half. In the second half, Movement and Protection scored one goal, winning 2-1. Although Movement and Protection still has one game to play, judging by the usual situation, their championship position is unlikely to change. Based on yesterday's match, Shun Kee's defense was stronger, and they had more opportunities to shoot, but the god of soccer did not favor them, and they missed by a hair's breadth each time. They lost their previous achievements by a single goal, which is a pity.</p>
<p>The Municipal and Earth team in the Construction group has four wins and one draw to date. Construction Nation had four wins. Yesterday's encounter was a battle for dominance. The first half ended in a 1-1 tie. In the second half, the Municipal and Earth team scored again, while Construction Nation made no progress. Therefore, the Municipal and Earth team won 2-1, securing the championship for their group, because the Municipal and Earth team has completed all their matches, and the other teams' scores are not as high as the Municipal and Earth team.</p>
<p>Many members of the Yi Zhong team in the Student group cannot take time off to attend matches on Saturdays and Sundays due to work commitments. They have forfeited several matches in a row and feel that this is detrimental to the spirit of the competition, so they have sent a letter to the association requesting to withdraw. From now on, teams scheduled to play against Yi Zhong in that group do not need to appear.</p>

<p>Gold Price Falls Sharply</p>
<p>Reaches New Low of 845 Yuan</p>
<p>Plummeting a Dire 18.4 Yuan</p>

Early in the morning, due to the rise of silver markets in the UK and the US, large speculators were still trading above the listed price of 1875 after the market closed. The forward silver market in Montreal rose sharply by more than one cent. The price of raw gold in London rose by one shilling, resulting in frequent exchange rate contractions and cheaper pound prices. People were greatly alarmed. Trading outside the market opened, breaking the 60-yuan mark and retreating to 58-59 yuan. Unlike the previous days when the news of Minister Kung's visit to Wuhan boosted the market, those who went long have had their dreams shattered and continue to liquidate. Supply exceeded demand, falling to 52-53 yuan, and then rising to 56 yuan. People were confused, and the market was uncertain. After the market opened, Sassoon was willing to sell shillings, and the Central Bank's listing was announced, with both the UK and the US rising, and the customs gold unit falling by 1.2 cents, creating a weak situation. But after the low, prices hovered as the exchange rate hardened, and the bank continued to push out selling pressure, breaking the 50-yuan mark again. Banks took advantage of the low prices to buy slightly, and large investors still entered at low prices. At this point, there was contention at the 50-yuan mark, wavering uncertainly. Before long, the HSBC's listing of UK and US exchange rates was announced, with the rise being astonishing. People still found it difficult to maintain confidence, and sellers easily exerted their power and fell again. Although there was a rebound in the middle, it finally created a low price of 845 yuan, and then the decline slightly stopped. The Central Bank came to buy forward shillings, and buyers were slightly active, gradually rising back up, but still struggling around 50 yuan, in a state of extreme uncertainty. Qiao Zhifu was still selling shillings. The Central Bank bought more shillings, and the exchange rate tightened, slightly boosting people's confidence, and the buying sentiment recovered slightly. After this, the situation stabilized and rebounded. However, the bank still sold expensively, and the exchange rate gradually loosened again. The rise was short-lived, and large investors gradually sold off. At noon, it finally broke the 50-yuan mark again, which was the general trend, easy to fall and difficult to rise. The silver market was bound to rise, with many floating profits being liquidated. Here is a record of the market situation for the first half of the day:</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>Yarn Prices Fall, Supported by Bullish Forces</p>
<p>Exchange Rates Continue to Lengthen</p>
<p>Foreign Yarn Prices Reasonable</p>
<p>Domestic Cotton Price Decline Difficult to Curb</p>
<p>The yarn market is generally sluggish and weak. As exchange rates rise sharply, foreign yarn prices are falling, naturally putting pressure on domestic yarn. However, a major player has organized a bullish company for standard yarn, holding firm and displaying a very strong attitude. Therefore, the current situation remains calm. However, the international flow of gold and silver is turbulent, which has a significant impact on prices in our country. Future changes are difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster: Quiet with Underlying Weakness</p>
<p>The opening prices of standard yarn futures for all months showed a downward trend. This was due to the sluggish overseas cotton market and the panic caused by the big "Eight Angle" gold market. Near-term contracts fell nine jiao, while far-term contracts fell seven or eight jiao. However, the goods absorbed by the bullish company remained untouched. After bidding for two or three rounds, the market tightened again. As a result, near-term contracts fell two, three, or four jiao, while far-term contracts lost seven jiao. The afternoon session opened quietly, with sluggish trading and little change in the market. At the same time, it was reported that sales of spot yarn were still sustainable. General speculators are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards standard yarn. Due to the manipulation by financially strong players, trading has decreased, waiting for opportunities to move. The closing was very stable, with each contract rising slightly by one jiao. Sales included 900 bales from Da Ji, 750 bales from Jin Chang, 800 bales from Jun Chang, 800 bales from Tai Chang, 550 bales from Tong He, 1,350 bales from Xin Cheng, 400 bales from Shen Ji, 400 bales from Chang Feng, 400 bales from Tong Xing, and 400 bales from Ming De. Purchases included 1,100 bales from Da Fu, 400 bales from Da Feng, 500 bales from Xin Chang, 1,450 bales from Ren Feng, 2,000 bales from Run Kang, 800 bales from Sheng Yuan, and 800 bales from Yong Da. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>1,600 Bales of Yarn Sold</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still quite good. It is reported that various groups purchased a total of 1,580 bales today, with prices similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts for each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Sichuan 530 Henan 610 Inland 140</p>
<p>Ningbo 25 Fellow Traders 35 Changsha 40</p>
<p>Guangdong 165 Shantou 30 Wuhu 10</p>
<p>The cotton market remains weak, and the decline has not been curbed. This is due to the gold price breaking the 850 yuan mark, the sharp rise in Indian and American exchange rates, and the continued decline in the American and Indian cotton markets, resulting in continuously lower calculated prices. The price ratio with our domestic cotton market is getting closer, but with some profit offsetting, the market is relatively flat. The demand from cotton mills in the market is dull, and the future of the cotton market is not optimistic.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Still in Decline</p>
<p>The opening prices of standard cotton futures for all months continued to decline. This was due to a slight increase of two to five points in American cotton market prices, a decline of one rupee in Indian cotton, and a sharp fall in the gold market, reaching a new low. Therefore, selling pressure remained strong in the second session. However, in the third session closing, some profit-takers covered their short positions and rose. However, Ningbo and Feng factories continued to cut their long positions, resulting in an average decline of five fen to one jiao and a half to two jiao and a half. The afternoon session opened firm, but turned loose and rampant after bidding for two or three rounds due to unfavorable news from all sides. Gold prices closed at a low point, and the Indian cotton black market remained unchanged. There was a lack of buyers in the market, and each month fell by another five fen to one jiao and a half. Sales included 5,300 dan from Tong Ji, 1,900 dan from Yu Kang, 1,900 dan from Ming De, 2,100 dan from Geng Feng, 2,100 dan from Jun Chang, 1,500 dan from Ren Feng, 3,900 dan from Yuan Yi, 2,400 dan from Yong Chang, 11,700 dan from Chang He, 2,600 dan from Run Kang, 1,500 dan from Sheng Yuan, and 1,700 dan from Xin Cheng. Purchases included 2,000 dan from Da Feng, 3,000 dan from Ji Feng, 6,200 dan from Da Fu, 2,400 dan from Ji Long, 5,300 dan from Yuan Da, 1,300 dan from Tai Xing, 1,400 dan from Yi Chang, 4,400 dan from Chang Feng, 1,500 dan from Tong He, 1,300 dan from Yi Kang, and 1,600 dan from Xin Heng. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Domestic Cotton Consumption Nonexistent</p>
<p>Spot cotton sales are unusually sluggish. Because exchange rates have been rising for days, foreign cotton prices are gradually approaching, making merchants increasingly reluctant to deal in Chinese cotton.</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton Inventory in Shanghai Exceeds 100,000 Bales</p>
<p>Surveyed on March 1st</p>
<p>American Cotton: Weak First, Firm Later</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened flat, with each month fluctuating by one or two points. In the first hour, the price fell slightly due to Wall Street bulls closing positions and Liverpool sellers simultaneously buying and farmers selling cotton futures to hedge. Later, the market improved slightly due to buying from fellow traders and short covering. However, with the small drop in silver coins, people's hearts remained unsettled. Domestic spot demand was better, and the textile industry's situation was dim. According to estimates from the Cotton Exchange, excluding Oklahoma, eight states sold a total of 560,000 tons of fertilizer in February, compared to 385,000 tons in the same period last year. Shi Huaibai Company estimates this year's cotton acreage to be 34,572,000 acres. Hester estimates this week's mill consumption to be 221,000 bales, and Liverpool's inventory to be 325,000 bales. The closing trend was firm, with spot prices rising five points and futures prices rising five to ten points. The British cotton market was stable, with spot prices falling three points and futures prices falling one or two points. The Indian cotton market initially fell due to selling by traders and a few European exporters, but then rebounded due to buying by speculators. Pingguoer rose by half a rupee, Omula rose by 0.25 rupees, and Bairuoxi fell by 0.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (One-day telegram)</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for Bairuoxi on the 2nd was 245.5 rupees, the same as the previous day's close.</p>
<p>American Cotton Weekend Statistics (Unit: Thousands of Bales)</p>
<p>Egyptian Cotton Weekend Statistics (Unit: Thousands)</p>
<p>Shanghai Foreign Cotton Import Statistics</p>
<p>According to a survey by a foreign firm, Shanghai's foreign cotton imports in January totaled 4,450 bales of American cotton, 7,030 bales of Indian cotton, and 2,150 bales of Egyptian cotton.</p>
<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Foreign Wheat Orders Again Reasonable</p>
<p>Flour Market Overwhelmed by Selling</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the market for each month showed a consistent downward trend. Foreign wheat quotations, although slightly better in Chicago by four fen to one jiao, and about one jiao and a half better in Canada, the opening price, because of the continued sharp fall in the gold market and the lengthening of the exchange market, was no different from opening a new door for the import of foreign wheat. Therefore, after the opening price, each month fell by one, two or three fen. Only in the second round, because the decline was too frenzied, profit-taking short positions had also vigorously covered, so it also rebounded once. By the time the afternoon session opened, the situation had changed greatly, and trading was still active. Due to the lengthening of the exchange rate, the sale of foreign wheat was expected. It was reported that Amai Lian reached 4.25 yuan, and the manufacturer set up one and a half ships. Australian wheat was set for one ship, priced at 4.70 yuan, so selling was in full swing, and people's hearts were even more unsettled. If it were below May, it broke through the three jiao mark. If the downward trend of gold prices had not stopped, the future would still not be optimistic. As a result, this month fell by four fen, April fell by three fen and seven li and a half, May fell by three fen and a half, June fell by four fen, July fell by four fen and two li and a half, and August fell by three fen.</p>
<p>Yesterday's oat market, after opening in the morning, showed a near-flat, far-falling trend in each month. Foreign oat quotations were slightly better by four fen to one jiao and a half. At the opening price, because of the decline in the gold market, people's hearts were still unstable. However, March and April, because they were old oats, the current environment was not good, but the reserves were not abundant, and they could not be transferred with the gold price. Therefore, in the weak market, the degree of decline was limited. July and August were also flat at the beginning, with little pullback. By the time the afternoon session opened, although people's hearts were not good in March and April, the degree of decline was still not huge. As for the new wheat standard, it was reported that foreign wheat continued to be set for two and a half ships, and the price was successively reduced by three or five fen, so selling was very smooth and the decline was also frenzied. As a result, March and April fell three fen more, July and August each fell one jiao. Because the factory appetite was sluggish after the standard fell sharply, there was no exchange.</p>
<p>Sales Stagnant, Rice Prices Fall by a Jiao</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 20 groups of sources arrived, with a total of more than 4,000 shi of goods. Both retail and wholesale sales continued to be stagnant, and prices frequently went downstream. The price of each thick japonica, except for those with high-quality materials, fell by several fen, while the price of medium-quality ones fell by about a jiao. The price of late indica was even more scarce, reduced by about a jiao. Du Yangjian lacked goods and had no market. The way out for Yinbian Yuan was stagnant, down by one or two jiao.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 22 or 23 sources from the river arrived. The market for each good moved slightly in retail. The price of white japonica was high, and the medium-to-second grade rose slightly by five or six hao. The price of early thin indica rose by several fen, and the rest of the goods were flat.</p>
<p>Hunan Rice Sources Will Be Cut Off</p>
<p>Broken Foreign Rice Tax Increased by 25%</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign customer Xian market situation continued the fatigue of the past few days, and the market price was still difficult to recover. However, people's hearts were slightly stable. The production price in Hunan Province was high, and there was now a ban on exports. In the future, the source of customer Xian was about to be cut off, and foreign broken rice only levied half the tax in the past. In recent days, sales were booming, and the number of fixed arrivals was high, and the pricing was similar to that of Shantong foreign rice. Therefore, there was an increase of 25% in practice. Therefore, people's hearts were slightly stable, but the current inventory was sufficient, and floating stocks had exceeded one million bags, and new arrivals were still constantly arriving at the port, so the market price was not easy to expand. Yesterday, a total of 7,550 bags of foreign rice and 986 bags of customer Xian were opened. The local office went to high Saigon 2,500 bags, Hankou went to Siamese rice for more than 1,000 bags, and the rest were all handled by Jiangzhe inland, and the market price was three or five fen smaller than the previous market.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>8,000 Bags of Dutch Coarse White Sugar to be Shipped Immediately</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market, with the continued decline in customs gold, the lowest reached 1705, the trend of foreign sugar was still soft, and the association's settlement was also worth Saturday, and there was no transaction. The ex-factory price of local cotton white sugar was reduced by one jiao. Zhenyu No. 1 was 16.20 yuan, No. 2 was 16.10 yuan, No. 3 was 15.95 yuan, and No. 4 was 15.80 yuan. The sugar industry cooperation company opened 8,000 bags of coarse sand white to be shipped immediately, and the price was 2.675 Dutch guilders. It is rumored that the land sugar, foreign sugar, and tariff rules will have actual changes on April 1, and many Dun speculated that it should be a tax increase, so the later market may have the possibility of turning around.</p>
<h3>Oil Market</h3>
<p>White Tung Oil Soars by Telegram</p>
<p>Hong Tung Oil First Batch Also Opens</p>
<p>Since the end of last month, after the Han market rose to 33 yuan per foreign house, both the day before yesterday and yesterday, there were several telegrams a day, and the telegram price soared, from 34 yuan to 34.80 yuan. According to the last telegram last night, it has been increased to 35 yuan, and there are still news from other ports that the Han line wholesale domestic sales oil has risen to 21 taels. If so, I am afraid that the foreign house oil is more than 35 yuan. And wait for the follow-up telegram to be detailed.</p>
<p>The Hong Red Tung Oil sub-brand has undergone great changes in its shape since the year-end settlement, and the local house's selling price has been increased by one yuan, between 23.45 yuan per barrel. The first batch of new goods began in Zhenjiang the day before yesterday, and the price was 18 taels and 7 qian, for how much in total, it has not been determined yet, and the silver futures have not been agreed upon, and there will be a definite number in two or three days. Only the Shanghai silver cost is slightly weaker at 24 yuan, so it can still meet the current market selling price.</p>

<h3>Do You Like to Eat Candy?</h3>
<p>— Chonglou</p>
<p>Little friends: Do you like to eat candy? I know, you must like it very much; because the taste of "Banana Candy," "Milk Candy," and "Peanut Candy" is very good, and it feels very sweet in your mouth; but if you eat too much candy, your stomach will become sour, or you will have toothache!</p>
<p>Little friends: Do you like to take medicine? I know, you definitely don't like it; because the taste of "Castor Oil," "Magnesium Sulfate," and "Quinine" is very bitter, and it feels very uncomfortable in your mouth; but if you are sick and can't move in bed, the doctor gives you medicine, but it can cure your disease and restore your health to normal.</p>
<p>So we can't say that sugar is good because it tastes sweet, or that medicine is bad because it tastes bitter. Not only are sugar and medicine like this in the world, but there are many other things like this. For example, games are very happy and reading is very troublesome, but if a person only knows how to play games and doesn't know how to read, then his knowledge will not be built up, and he will not be able to stand in society in the future, and he will not even have a bowl of rice to eat in society! Conversely, if a person is willing to study hard and doesn't play too much, then he will definitely be able to build up a wealth of knowledge in the future and contribute a great career to society.</p>
<p>Little friends: After listening to my words, are you preparing to be a hardworking child or a gluttonous child?</p>
<h3>Hoping that Children Will Also Become Inventors</h3>
<p>— Dazhai</p>
<p>Little friends, seeing this title, you may say that you have read too little and are too young, how can you have such hope for me, isn't it a joke? But, it's not a joke, really, let's look at the little friends in Soviet Russia recently.</p>
<p>Soviet education is developed, and children also study hard, so the inventions of children have reached as many as 2,000 kinds. Looking back at our country's little friends, are there any inventions? But I have never heard of it.</p>
<p>Watt invented the steam engine when he was young after seeing boiling water. Ford invented the car structure when he was young after repairing watches. Using children's curiosity, creating great mechanical inventions, it can be seen that children becoming inventors has long existed in Western countries, not just starting today.</p>
<p>Inventors are certainly not easy to be, but what they find is in the ordinary things that everyone is used to seeing and hearing, paying attention everywhere, and examining them. It's just that they have sharp eyes, delicate brains, continuous perseverance, and a spirit of struggle, so they can see, think, and do it, so that their purpose can be achieved. It is the hard work of hard work, not the lucky success of carelessness and airiness. Little friends, if you want to be inventors, you must know that there is nothing mysterious, and usually put your strength into it. As the saying goes, "Those who have the will are also like this", it is not impossible to achieve.</p>
<h3>National Flower</h3>
<p>— Last Month</p>
<p>Little friends, aren't there many national flags hanging in your school or living room? Such as England, Germany, the United States, Japan... etc. But did you know? In addition to the style of the flag as a symbol, each country also has a flower, called the national flower. Now I will write down a few that I know, and if there are many more that I don't know, please ask your teacher!</p>
<p>China—Plum Blossom England—Rose</p>
<p>Germany—Cornflower Japan—Cherry Blossom</p>
<p>Italy—Daisy America—Mountain Buckthorn</p>
<p>France—Lily Portugal—Amaranth</p>
<p>Mexico—Cactus Austria—Camellia</p>
<p>Peru—Sunflower Spain—Milo</p>
<p>Egypt—Lotus Chile—Red Lily of the Valley</p>
<p>Greece—Olive Blossom Sweden—Water Lily</p>

<h3>How to Organize an Extracurricular Reading Club</h3>
<p>— Shen Yanying, a 13-year-old girl from Shanghai Longhu Primary School</p>
<p>Extracurricular reading clubs help us increase our interest in reading and develop self-study habits.</p>
<p>The extracurricular books that everyone reads are different. Some like to read historical stories, some want to see funny pictures, and some like to read adventure novels. Then, those with similar interests can be grouped together to form a group. (There are six people in each group in our school)</p>
<p>Ask the teacher to find a way to collect the books read in each group. After we finish reading, we gather together and everyone talks about the joy of reading.</p>
<p>Our extracurricular reading club has various competitions. Which group reads more or faster. Report to the General Assembly once a week. Reviewed by the committee.</p>
<p>Dear little friends! You can also organize an extracurricular reading club, which has several benefits.</p>
<p>(1) Books can be exchanged with each other (be careful not to damage them.)</p>
<p>(2) You can ask questions that you don't understand and discuss them together.</p>
<p>(3) Cultivate the ability to read books by yourself.</p>
<p>(4) Increase all knowledge.</p>
<p>Okay, let's organize it!</p>
<h3>Why Do Frogs Hibernate?</h3>
<p>— Chengzhao</p>
<p>Little friends, to know "Why do frogs hibernate"? We must first study whether frogs are warm-blooded animals or cold-blooded animals?</p>
<p>Zoology tells us: "Whether the climate is hot or cold, the body temperature of animals remains unchanged, which is called warm-blooded animals. Otherwise, they are cold-blooded animals." When the climate is warm in summer, frogs are also warm. But when winter comes and the climate is cold, the frog's body also becomes cold. Do you think frogs are not cold-blooded animals?</p>
<p>Because the frog's body becomes cold when it is cold in winter; so at that time it always shrinks its limbs and can't do anything, and can't even do things like eating! It will only hide in the ground to sleep, which is called "hibernation".</p>
<p>Little friends, I think you must be wondering and asking me: "So frogs don't eat food during hibernation, won't they starve to death"? Yes. Because frogs can't eat food when they hibernate; so they have to eat more food in the warm summer. Like ants, these cold-blooded animals, when the climate becomes cold in winter, they hide in their nests and don't come out. But they have already accumulated food for the winter in the summer?</p>
<h3>Animals Living a Cooperative Life in North America</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ming</p>
<p>North American river beavers have very sharp teeth. They gnaw off tree trunks and take the bark and branches as food, and take the trunks as nests. They often gather the strength of the same kind and use their very sharp teeth to gnaw off the roots of the trees along the shore. When the roots are gnawed off, the tree falls into the river, and they use the fallen trees as dams; they surround the water along the river bank and store it in the dam, and all the beavers live in separate groups, like a village. The same kind are sent to serve as guards, stationed permanently, and if they encounter an enemy attack, everyone will go forward to resist together.</p>
<p>The bighorn sheep of Rocky Mountain also gather the same tribe into a group. If they are on the road to travel and rest, or when they are collecting food, they must take turns to be guards to protect the whole group.</p>
<p>The wild bison in the North American plains often travel in teams, walking in a line, often taking two or three days to complete. Therefore, some farmers and workers often encounter them, blocking them from moving forward. Also, when other tribes invade, they will put the old and young in the center of the team, and the strong on the outside of the team, and work together to resist the enemy. If a wolf snatches a cow from the herd, then those—a group of cows that have not been snatched, will work together to chase after it, and will not stop until they get the cow back.</p>

<h3>Science Teacher Magic</h3>
<p>— He Gongchao</p>
<p>Please Nose as a Detective</p>
<p>Science teacher was on stage again not long after the start of school. He took three copper coins and said to the audience:</p>
<p>"Little friends, today I will do magic, only using these three copper coins; but although there are few tools, it is still very interesting and meaningful to change. From this, we can know: If we understand all kinds of scientific common sense, then, even if they are a few copper coins or a few pieces of paper, they can be used as experimental tools and can also change into magical magic."</p>
<p>"Today, this magic trick needs my nose to help. Come, come, come, little friends!" He said, spreading his palms and putting three copper coins in his palms, closing his eyes, and said to a child in front of the stage:</p>
<p>"I'm not watching, you can take away any one of the copper coins. After a while, you return the copper coin to me, and I will ask Mr. Nose to detect which copper coin you took away, and it will be correct.—But my eyes are always closed."</p>
<p>The child waved a copper coin in his hand that was thinner with two five-color flags.</p>
<p>Science teacher said: "Put it on the side of the stage, don't hold it in your hand."</p>
<p>He continued to close his eyes and squeezed the remaining two copper coins tightly in his palm. After two or three minutes, he said to the little friend again:</p>
<p>"Now please return the copper coin you took away to me."</p>
<p>Now, he still has three copper coins in his hand—he put them on his nose one by one, as if asking it to smell them, and finally, he unhesitatingly held the copper coin that the little friend had taken away in his hand and showed it to the child, saying:</p>
<p>"It must be this one, right?"</p>
<p>When the child looked at it, it was indeed the thinner copper coin with two five-color flags. So everyone praised and wondered.</p>
<p>"It's very simple to say. It turns out that copper is a metal, and metal is a very easy thing to conduct heat. The remaining two copper coins were placed in my hand for a few minutes, and the heat from my hand was transferred to them, so they were all warm; but the copper coin that this little friend took away did not transfer heat, it is still very cold. When I touched these three copper coins one by one on the tip of my nose, because they were different in cold and heat, I knew which copper coin had been taken away. Isn't it very simple and interesting? At the same time, we can get a common sense, that is, metal is easy to conduct heat. If we use paper balls or cloth strips to experiment, this magic trick will fail, because these two things are not easy to conduct heat."</p>

<h3>The Adventures of Sinbad the Sailor (8)</h3>
<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>Before long, they reached the ship. We watched them climb up like monkeys, and finally they were on our deck.</p>
<p>They pulled down the sails and dragged the ship to the shore, but we dared not lift a hand to stop them. They made us go ashore, then left us, took our ship, and sailed to their own island.</p>
<p>Look at the island they abandoned us on, it was feared by people. For this reason, when it can be avoided, no ship dares to sail into it.</p>
<p>After those dwarfs left, we continued to walk forward, passing through the land, discovering some herbs and fruits, but we all thought we were not far from death. Finally, we saw a large house in the distance, so we set off towards it.</p>
<p>This was an extremely large structure, with a large black wooden door, fit for a king's residence.</p>
<p>We went in through the door and immediately saw a pile of human bones, and nearby were several iron forks for roasting meat, as if used by cooks to roast large pieces of meat. Seeing these things made us tremble with fear.</p>
<p>While we were in this state of sorrow, the door suddenly opened, and a tall, black man walked in. He was as tall as a tree; he had only one eye, right in the middle of his forehead, shining like burning coal; his mouth was huge, his hands were long and sharp; his ears were large and wide, like the ears of a large beast, and his nails were like the claws of a carnivore. When we saw this terrifying sight, we fainted and lay on the ground like dead men.</p>
<p>Later, we woke up and saw the black man still standing in front of us. He looked at us for a while, then walked towards us. He picked me up with both hands, caressing my whole body, but there was nothing but skin and bones on me, so he put me down. He picked up my friends one by one and caressed them in the same way.</p>
<p>Our leader was not as thin as the rest of us, so the black man picked him up, pierced him with an iron fork, and roasted him over the fire. After roasting him, our enemy ate him and then lay down to sleep. He slept soundly all night, his snoring loud, shaking the whole house.</p>
<p>You can be sure that none of us could sleep that night. When dawn came, the man woke up and went out, leaving us in the palace. After he left, we tried to find a way to kill him. When night came, we were still full of fear for our lives.</p>

<p>Women's Sphere</p>
<h3>Written Before "March 8th" Festival</h3>
<p>— Zi Jiu</p>
<p>The gentle spring breeze blows out tender green willow buds, the warm sunshine nurtures sprouting grass, the earth returns to spring! Even the weak willows and delicate grasses can grow freely, but the majority of women on the Chinese land still live their old-fashioned lives!</p>
<p>In 1907, when the earth returned to spring, Ms. Zetkin of Germany led international women to establish the International Women's Congress, engaging in the women's liberation movement and the labor movement. The congress was established on March 8th in early spring. Since then, to commemorate this meaningful event and hoping to continuously strive to achieve the final goal, it was decided that this day would be "International Women's Day."</p>
<p>Therefore, Women's Day is not a good festival for ladies, grandmothers, and young ladies to chat, talk, dance, gather for meals, and so on, but a memorial day for women to rise up themselves to seek liberation and happiness.</p>
<p>Since then, every year on this day, women from various countries have held enthusiastic commemorative meetings. However, the way of commemoration varies in its purpose due to the different positions of women in each country. Those who have already been liberated naturally celebrate with joy and dance. Those who have not yet been liberated follow the past struggles and plan future combat strategies.</p>
<p>Chinese women, because they have been poisoned by feudal society, live an inhuman life. Open a Chinese cultural history, and you will know that the entire Chinese society in the past was dominated by Confucianism. How did the Confucian eyes see women? Just from the simple definition in the Book of Rites: "Women follow others, in youth they follow their fathers and elder brothers, when married they follow their husbands, and when their husbands die they follow their sons," it can be understood. It clearly casts women into a subordinate position, stipulating that she has no independent and self-respecting person or behavior. Later, Song Confucianism advocated women's chastity, which further deprived women of their sexual freedom. By the end of the Ming Dynasty, the saying "A woman's lack of talent is a virtue" completely wanted to treat women as a speechless puppet.</p>
<p>The wheel of time finally crushed the stubborn thoughts of the Chinese people and gave birth to the New Culture Movement of the "May Fourth" era. The women's liberation movement was also one of the goals of the New Culture Movement at that time.</p>
<p>However, with the slowing down and lurking of the revolutionary tide, the retro style has become rampant again, re-singing the chastity of women, driving away remarried women... These are all clear evidence. We do not oppose preserving national essence, nor do we oppose maintaining inherent virtues, but the past Chinese contempt for women is a fact. Before this "March 8th" in 1935, groups engaged in the women's movement should unite to oppose feudalism and blind restoration.</p>
<p>At the same time, the iron hooves of imperialism are trampling on China everywhere. Chinese women should open their eyes and recognize their true colors when the earth returns to spring.</p>
<h3>Women's Issues Lecture</h3>
<p>— Jun Hui</p>
<p>Lecture 2: Biological Exploration of Gender Issues</p>
<p>Section 1: The Question of Gender Superiority in Biology</p>
<p>I think that anyone who studies women's issues must first correctly understand the question of gender superiority in biology. Because when our research takes the first step, we will encounter opponents who stand on the biological point of view and advocate male superiority to oppose gender equality. If we do not have a correct understanding of this issue, it is easy to admit male superiority and place women in a preordained inferior position.</p>
<p>We know that all the rulers in history have created certain principles or laws suitable for them in order to maintain their dominant position forever, so that the general ruled people believe in them and obey them! There are many such examples. The ancient Greek aristocratic philosopher Plato advocated the sacred theory of aristocracy, and King Charles I of England in the Middle Ages advocated the divine right of kings. Similarly, in a male-dominated society, the theory of male superiority will inevitably arise, which will be used as a theoretical basis to explain male dominance and even as a mysterious mantra to consolidate its dominant position! This is not surprising at all.</p>
<p>The so-called male superiority theory undoubtedly originated after the establishment of the so-called patriarchal system. For thousands of years until now, it has dominated the minds of all people, and regardless of whether they are male or female, noble or lowly, they regard it as a God-given theorem. Not to mention the past, even in the "civilized century" that advocates gender equality, ordinary women with unclear minds still recognize this theorem and recognize the preordained inferiority of women themselves. This is undoubtedly a major obstacle to the women's liberation movement!</p>
<p>So, what is the theoretical basis of the so-called male superiority theory? Its argument is first and foremost the most primitive and unscientific theory of yin and yang, for example, taking natural phenomena such as heaven, earth, sun, moon, yin, yang, water, and fire to symbolize male and female. To prove the theorem that men are superior to women, the Book of Changes says: "Heaven is superior and earth is inferior, Qian and Kun are determined!" This can be said to be the most typical symbolic argument, but today, it has lost its value! Secondly, the most important argument is biological and even physiological. According to it, all creatures take the male as the main body, and the female is only its appendage. Especially in the animal kingdom, such as mammals and birds, males are physically stronger than females, the organization of various parts of the body is also more complex, and the appearance is also better. Humans are the same. Whether they are barbarians or civilized people, women are generally shorter and weaker than men, the weight of their brains is also less than that of men, and their mental activity is also lower than that of men. In this way, women are naturally inferior to men. This is the so-called biological male superiority theory.</p>
<p>Those who advocate male superiority, like other mechanical phenomenalists of the rulers, only observe phenomena with a fixed eye and want to fossilize phenomena, but they are unwilling to examine the causes and essence of phenomena with a dynamic eye. The male superiority of some animals and humans is a real phenomenon, and this phenomenon must have its historical reasons! However, the discovery of this reason is the greatest threat to male dominance. Why? Because this will lose the theoretical basis of male dominance!</p>
<p>Modern science, especially the development of biology and sociology, has finally clarified the essence of gender issues in humans and even the biological world. Darwin discovered the law of biological evolution and shattered the ghost story of the ruler's God creating Adam and Eve; astronomer Copernicus invented the heliocentric theory and broke the traditional geocentric theory; and the author of ancient society, Morgan, discovered the matriarchal system and explained the historical causes and essence of the patriarchal system. In particular, Lesterwood, an American sociologist and biologist, invented the female-centered theory of the biological world, giving a fatal blow to the traditional male superiority theory!</p>
<p>According to Watt's research results, biology originally took the female as the main body, and the male was only its appendage. The female is the source of life. In the process of biological evolution, in order to make the organism more advanced, the male thing was derived from the female, so that it can fulfill the task of cross-fertilization of heterogeneity. In some humans and higher animals, there seems to be a phenomenon of male superiority, but this has its own special reasons. In human society, the general prevalence of male-centered theory is the result of superficial observation, stubborn rumors, habits, and prejudices.</p>
<p>Here, we see two completely opposite theories of gender issues. Namely, male-centered theory and female-centered theory. But Watt's words are based on science, and we still have to believe him. He himself said: "My research is like Copernicus' heliocentric theory and Darwin's theory of evolution, which eliminated many criticisms and shattered the rumors of the time, and will soon sweep away the male-centered theory."</p>
<h3>Modern American Women</h3>
<p>— Guan Lu</p>
<p>In the old feudal society, everything about women was not free, freedom, freedom, freedom of career, freedom of sex, and freedom of various activities. Women's labor was exploited, their sexuality was occupied; their position was subordinate, a position of slavery.</p>
<p>The rise of capitalism called out the slogans of equality and freedom, and advocated the women's liberation movement, reforming the imbalance of the status of men and women in the feudal era. So, what kind of life do women in capitalist society live? How do they enjoy the rights of freedom and equality? Now let us first take a look at the women in the United States.</p>
<p>Now the United States is the most developed capitalist country, and American women are also relatively free women in many countries; the so-called slogan of "Ladies First" that supports women's rights is also best practiced in the United States. From this point of view, American women are completely liberated, completely equal and free!</p>
<p>Originally, when women of the general upper class talk about freedom and gender equality, they always think that freedom is to enjoy property rights and civil rights equal to men. They regard freedom as pursuing careers, engaging in creative work, and not being hindered by gender in any occupation or career. Such freedom, in capitalist countries, is mostly already obtained by women of the privileged class. Legal obstacles and shortcomings have also been mostly deleted and revised in the United States. Many institutions of higher education and occupational positions have also been opened to women.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the privileged groups, housewives can hire servants to handle household affairs, and those with children can hire nannies! Or pay to send their children to private kindergartens. In this way, a married woman can comfortably engage in various careers like a single woman, and can occupy a major position in the field of occupation and career.</p>
<p>However, in capitalist countries, apart from these privileged classes and women with special forces, what about the general women of the middle and lower classes who rely entirely on intellectual and physical labor?</p>
<p>We can take a look at the general living conditions of many intellectual and physical working women in the United States:</p>
<p>Teachers in schools, the career of teaching in schools, in the United States in recent decades, has almost been mostly the career of women. In the past fifty years, the number of male teachers in schools has gradually decreased. According to a survey in 1930, out of the 1,037,000 teaching positions in the United States, 853,967, or even more than 80% of the people, were women. In the past ten years, the number of female teachers in the United States has increased by more than 200,000, and the number of female teachers in all public schools has exceeded three-quarters of the total. However, the remuneration for female teachers in general schools is less than that for men, while the work done is equal, which is a determined method.</p>
<p>Clerks in institutions, in the past ten years, the number of female clerks in various institutions in the United States has increased from 500,000 to 1,986,830. Almost half of the clerks are women.</p>
<p>Before the start of the economic crisis, the salaries of clerks in American institutions were relatively high. Starting in 1926, the salaries of female clerks began to be reduced. The salary of female secretaries was on average 14 yuan and 66 cents less per week than that of men. Female bookkeepers were 10 yuan and 87 cents less than men. During the crisis, salaries were generally reduced by 10 yuan to 20 yuan per week. However, the salaries of male clerks at that time were still almost twice that of women.</p>
<p>Waiters in hotels and restaurants, for the special working ability of women, waiters in hotels and restaurants are also mostly women. The total number of female cooks in all restaurants and hotels in the United States is 94,252. Female waiters 209,593. Other female workers 109,124. From 1900 to 1930, this number gradually increased over these thirty years. As for their salaries, they have also gradually decreased in recent years. For example, the Blackstone Hotel in Chicago used to pay cooks 12 yuan per week, and some hotels paid 15 yuan. However, after the economic crisis, in the spring of 1930, some were reduced to 30 yuan per month, while men were paid more.</p>
<p>Now, let's take a further look at the working women in the machine factories that are directly related to capitalist production in capitalist society:</p>
<p>The more developed capitalism is, the more advanced the machines are, the more skilled workers are squeezed out, and the more women and children without specialized skills are absorbed into the factory.</p>
<p>Before 1817, a great thinker said: "Women and children are the first thing that capitalists who master machines seek." By 1848, this great thinker and his friend had also seen that capitalism would absorb a large number of women into the production process. Because machine production does not entirely require heavy work, what capitalists need more is to use women to participate in work in light industrial plants and pay low wages.</p>
<p>Now let's look at the female workers in the United States. The number of female workers in general factories in the United States exceeds that of male workers, whether in spinning mills, cotton mills, or many light industrial factories. For example, the number of female workers in cigarette factories exceeds that of men by more than 74,000. In the past ten years, a total of 50,000 workers have also been laid off. The reason is that there are more female workers and the productivity is faster, so there is no need for so many workers.</p>
<p>I remember a person in the United States who was engaged in factory investigation saying to a factory manager: "Why do you like to recruit female workers instead of male workers?" His reply was: "For the work in light factories, female workers do it faster and better than men." Capitalists use women's ability to work hard, have patience, have no specialized skills, are easy to be controlled, can sit in the machine room all day, constantly work, constantly produce. And the results are better than male workers, so male workers are squeezed out.</p>
<p>As for wages, the wages of female workers are generally less than those of male workers. This is the case in many large factories in the United States. In 1933, there were many factories that hired a female worker for 1 yuan and 40 cents a day, while the male worker used to be paid 5 yuan a day. Roughly, the wages of female workers are 20% to 70% of the wages of male workers.</p>
<p>In capitalist society, physical working women, in addition to being excessively exploited for their labor, are often unable to develop according to their natural physiology due to the factory system, such as long working hours, night work, and other factory systems that hinder hygiene and physical development; and most adult women are prematurely aging.</p>
<p>Capitalism also sets regulations on working hours, factory laws to protect laborers, and calls out slogans to protect children and women, but these are only regulations, and these regulations still stand on the side of the factory owners, and laborers do not get benefits.</p>
<p>Looking at all the women's lives above, how do women live in capitalist society! How are the slogans of freedom, liberation, and gender equality advocated by capitalism used on women!</p>
<p>Women serve in society, participate in production in factories, and are not equal to men in terms of labor costs. When they return home, they naturally have a master-slave relationship between men and women due to the dominant economic position of men. In terms of gender relations, due to the commodification in capitalist society, women have also become commodities, occupied by men with economic advantages, and sexual life has become prostitution.</p>
<p>In the United States, although the slogan "Women First" is emphasized, this slogan is only an outer garment. In essence, due to economic dominance, the first is still the man, the husband; it is also the same as other free and equal forms of expression in capitalist society.</p>
<p>Based on the above situation, in capitalist society, women have obtained great opportunities in their careers; even in many schools, institutions, and other service places, the number of women exceeds that of male employees. But looking at the cost of women's labor, male and female employees who do the same work, the salary of female employees is less than that of men. Precisely because the cost of women's labor is low, schools, institutions, hotels, hospitals, and many places that need workers like to hire women. Therefore, in capitalist society, although there are many professional women, on the point of profession, the status of women is lower, and men and women are not equal.</p>
<h3>The Life of a Buddhist Academy</h3>
<p>— Qian</p>
<p>Several years ago, when I was wandering in a famous town in the Yangtze River basin, I happened to meet several female lay Buddhists who had seen through the world and become nuns to study Buddhism. They lived in a place called a Buddhist Academy. This Buddhist Academy was ideally suited for monks and nuns, built on a hillside in a secluded and quiet location. Not far from the entrance were two large vegetable gardens. Passing through a stone-paved path about ten feet long between the gardens led to the lecture hall, also known as the classroom. Further inside, a seven- or eight-foot-long corridor led to the main hall—the place for worshiping Buddha. On both sides of the main hall, connected in a row, were Chinese-style bungalows divided into front and back suites, which served as the bedrooms and study spaces for the female lay Buddhists.</p>
<p>There weren't many female lay Buddhists in the academy, only seven or eight in total. It was said that they were transferred from a lay Buddhist association across the river. These seven or eight female lay Buddhists were all in their early twenties and had received considerable education, some even having worked as teachers. However, if you only glanced at their bald heads, the wide gray cloth robes covering them from neck to ankle, white cloth socks, nun shoes shaped like silver ingots, and the rosary beads on their wrists, you probably wouldn't have a good impression of them. If I hadn't lived with them for a few days, I would never have imagined that behind that solemn, otherworldly demeanor, there was a heart as full of life as mine, and that their emotions were even stronger than those of ordinary people.</p>
<p>Their daily routine included three scheduled visits to the main hall for worship: the first at 4:30 in the morning, the second at noon, and the third at 6 in the afternoon. In the dim morning light and the dark twilight, in front of the "ancient Buddha with a green lamp" in the main hall, the female lay Buddhists' chanting, soft and continuous, mixed with the occasional sound of the big drum and the constant "po ya po ya" of the wooden fish, sounding like a plea or a lament. On weekdays, when a Dharma master or layperson—usually male—came to lecture, they also attended several classes in the morning and afternoon. The textbooks were naturally nothing more than things like "The Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana," "The Avatamsaka Sutra," and "The Diamond Sutra." When the lecture began, the eyes of the Dharma master or layperson on the platform were fixed on the scripture on the lectern, while the eyes of the female lay Buddhists below the platform were fixed on the scripture on their desks. The lecturer buried themselves in lecturing, and the listeners buried themselves in listening. Such a teaching scene, in the eyes of an outsider, was quite amusing.</p>
<p>These grand occasions of lecturing were not held every month, nor were they held exclusively in this Buddhist Academy. Sometimes they were held in other towns hundreds of miles away. At such times, the female lay Buddhists, like wandering monks, would wear straw sandals and travel to attend the lectures. As for their usual life in the academy, apart from going to the main hall three times a day for worship and occasionally attending lectures in the classroom, they would each copy or recite scriptures in their own rooms. In the evening, after worshiping Buddha in the main hall, they would each meditate and contemplate their own Zen. Although in this quite civilized town of the 20th century, electric lights were not available to them, Cao Xueqin's poem could still be used to describe them: "Pitiful are the daughters of noble families, sleeping alone beside the ancient Buddha with a green lamp." In their remaining free time, they would sew and wash their own clothes and socks, or each think their own thoughts.</p>
<p>In this kind of place for monks and nuns, the private property system has not yet been eliminated, and it can even be said that its existence is greatly encouraged. The status of the female lay Buddhists in the eyes of the manager (a cunning woman in her forties who had taken vows but not left the household) was directly proportional to their own private property. The Buddhist Academy had the obligation to provide the female lay Buddhists with clothing and food, but the female lay Buddhists had the obligation to perform rituals and chant sutras for the academy's patrons. Sometimes, when wealthy old men died, their wealthy sons or wives wanted to do something special, so they would invite these female lay Buddhists to chant sutras in the inner courtyard in the middle of the night, their silver bell-like voices resonating inside and out. This seemed like the final romantic service to the deceased. Sometimes, when the distinguished fathers or mothers of high officials, dignitaries, or famous and wealthy people passed away, the head of the academy would issue an order, and the female lay Buddhists would be led by the manager to the deceased's mourning hall, reciting scriptures day after day to help the deceased's soul transcend. Sometimes, this would continue for forty-nine days. By the time the female lay Buddhists' voices were hoarse, the head of the academy's pockets were full—not to mention the number of people who used their names to solicit donations outside on weekdays. This kind of life, I think, the female lay Buddhists never dreamed of when they shaved their heads!</p>
<p>I know in detail the reasons why four female lay Buddhists became nuns. Three of them were very close sisters in their secular families. Because they were all dissatisfied with their marriages, when the eldest sister's wedding date approached, the three of them quietly escaped to a convent in a neighboring town and shaved their heads. The fourth, a quite wealthy lay Buddhist, became a nun because her wealthy fiancé already had two concubines before marrying her as his legal wife, so she left home in anger. Now, although women are not as unfree in marriage as they used to be, in this era of endless chaste women, filial daughters, heroic women, and virtuous women, when customs are becoming increasingly antiquated, I think that soon, some married women who are dissatisfied with their marriages or are abused will also adopt this slow form of suicide to gain fame and praise. In that case, will my old acquaintance from a few years ago, the desolate Buddhist Academy in a certain famous town, soon have "flourishing business extending in all directions"?</p>
<h3>Women of Baoding</h3>
<p>— Zigang</p>
<p>Open the map of Hebei Province and we can find the three towns that form a triangle: Beijing, Tianjin, and Baoding.</p>
<p>It used to be called Baoding Prefecture, but now it has been changed to Qingyuan County. There was a period when it became a military stronghold and was relatively prosperous for a while. However, Baoding's most prosperous period was when Cao Kun lived there, because important people came and went, and large-scale hostels appeared—two of them—before disappearing without a trace.</p>
<p>Although Baoding once had a prominent history, women here have not experienced much development.</p>
<p>The women here still retain the simple characteristics of the countryside. This flavor is already quite strong in Baoding city, but it can be even more confirmed when you go to the four villages around Baoding. All the fashionable novelties cannot be found here. The new women that people generally pay attention to are just the female students in middle school. They are all dressed in plain white tops and black skirts, going to the streets on holidays to buy some school supplies or daily necessities. This is their most frequent opportunity to contact the outside world. Due to the female students' serious and simple style, people also treat them with a harmless attitude. Newspapers rarely use female students to find topics for amusement, a situation that is not easy for us to find in other cities.</p>
<p>As for love, it is simply a rare thing in Baoding's student circles, because firstly, boys and girls attend separate schools, and secondly, most of the students come from the countryside. Under the early marriage system, the students who come to middle school are already men with wives and women with husbands. Therefore, their private lives are stable. The highest institutions of learning for female students are Baoding Women's Normal School and Women's Vocational School. Their way out is to become elementary school teachers or to seek further education and work in other counties.</p>
<p>The general urban women are still considered diligent and thrifty. Apart from a few who manage their homes, are addicted to mahjong or gambling, and cannot talk about economic independence, most still cannot do without men's support. They earn a little pocket money in their spare time by sewing, because there are several sock factories in Baoding, so hemming the tops and mouths of socks has become a common occupation for women. This is done by taking materials from the factory and doing it at home, without having to go to the factory to work.</p>
<p>The rural women in the four villages are more able to support themselves. Like men, they have strong arms and great strength, and can spin thread and weave cloth in their homes in addition to working in the fields from dawn to dusk. However, in recent years, because weaving cloth from yarn spun by crude wooden machines would result in losses, the clumsy local tools finally could not compete with the dumping of foreign goods, and most women have given up this occupation and are now using foreign thread to weave cloth.</p>
<p>What is most prominent in the four villages is the child bride system. This custom is extremely common, even more so in the last two years. Because the poorer they are, the more they want to send out their young daughters who are "going to be someone else's family sooner or later" as child brides, saving food. On the other hand, they are also poor and cannot afford to hire long-term workers or buy livestock, so they hope to adopt child brides early to help, using them like livestock. Without exception, the lives of child brides are forever without sunshine. When they first arrive at their in-laws' home, they only have half a month of novelty—that is, for only half a month everyone treats her as a newcomer, not starting the brutal labor life yet. After this period, they are not polite. The newcomer is already busy in the cowshed and in the fields. In addition to labor, they also suffer unreasonable beatings. The so-called one generation pays for another. The mother-in-law always remembers the pain she suffered when she was a daughter-in-law. When she becomes a mother-in-law, she must repay the principal with interest. This is all due to the lack of knowledge. Also for this reason, child brides very much hope to have sons and marry daughters-in-law, because following these stages, their own pain can be gradually reduced.</p>
<p>This is a microcosm of the women of Baoding. Whether in the city or in the countryside, there are still more dark sides. Let's investigate the reasons.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu:</p>
<p>Your letter has been received and carefully read. Regarding the matters you inquired about, since you have stated that you do not wish to publish them publicly, we have respectfully followed your wishes and have already asked lawyer Pu Shunqing to send a special letter in reply.

<h3>The Standard of Beauty</h3>
<p>— Wang Yiming</p>
<p>From the perspective of general absolutists, things that are beautiful are beautiful regardless of the era, society, or people. They say that Yang Guifei would still be an undeniable beauty in modern times, so the standard of beauty is absolute. However, the problem is not that simple. In fact, the characteristics of beauties in the feudal era were "three-inch golden lotuses" and "willow waists," while the modern "standard beauty" is one who bares her chest, highlights her breasts, and uses a pair of natural feet to support her swaying body. Therefore, even Yang Guifei with her "three-inch golden lotuses" and "willow waist," I think, would not be recognized as an absolute "standard beauty" in present-day Shanghai, except perhaps as an antique to be appreciated. At the same time, the views on beauty differ from society to society and from group to group. In our view, the decoration of Indian women is the ugliest. They wear lantern-style pants, wrap their heads, and some even clamp metal objects on their noses. It is really extremely ugly, but Indians think this is very beautiful! We say that African Americans are too black and not good-looking, but they are afraid that they are not black enough, and often apply black things to their faces to make them black and shiny to show their beauty! Furthermore, if you put an old-fashioned portrait of a beauty next to a modern nude painting, and then ask a young artist with neatly combed hair and a farmer from the countryside to evaluate them, then I dare say that the conclusions they reach will be very different. All of this fully illustrates that the views on beauty in different eras, societies, and groups are not absolutely the same. In this sense, we can say that the standard of beauty is relative, not absolute.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, although the views on beauty differ from group to group, the views on beauty are the same within the same group. Although there are various different views on beauty in the same era and society, that is, the views on beauty of various groups exist, there must be one view on beauty that occupies a dominant position in this middle ground. This dominant view on beauty is the standard of beauty in that era and society. In the feudal era, the magnificent architecture, the great and sublime statues of gods, and even the yellow robes worn by emperors were the preferences of the feudal aristocracy, but these preferences dominated their era, and therefore those things became the publicly recognized beautiful things of that era and society. Similarly, tall, smooth-faced Western-style houses are the architecture of the wealthy, but at the same time, they are also considered beautiful architectural art by modern people, because this kind of aesthetic tendency dominates this era. Therefore, although a standard of beauty that transcends eras and societies cannot be established, there is a certain standard of beauty in the same era and society. In this sense, we can also say that the standard of beauty also has its absolute meaning, and is not absolutely relative. The view that the standard of beauty is absolutely relative is another erroneous manifestation of absolutists.</p>
<p>Fundamentally speaking, human aesthetic concepts do not come from innate talent, but are formed in their social life. The reason why the aesthetic concepts of people in different eras, societies, and groups are different is because their lives are different, not because they are born with different aesthetic concepts. Why do feudal aristocrats consider magnificent architecture and sublime and great statues of gods to be beautiful? That is because these things easily evoke a sense of solemnity and respect at first glance; they are very beneficial in maintaining their authority. Why do farmers like healthy beauties and dislike "delicate" beauties? That is also because they have to work, and a healthy beauty is helpful to their lives and does not add burden. If the problem is shifted to the decoration of the general ladies of the current city, then it becomes even clearer. You know, the decorations of modern cities change so quickly that new decorations appear almost every year and every month. If you make the most fashionable clothes this year, it may become "old-fashioned" next year. The year 1935 has not yet passed, but Chinese and foreign clothing stores, car dealerships, and department stores have all come up with new styles and new signs for 1936. Two years ago, fashionable girls loved to wear long stockings, but later they wore short socks, and now they don't even wear socks, simply showing off their physical beauty. In terms of coats, short coats were popular two years ago, but the so-called new style coats recently are long and dragging, and even have slits in the back. ... What is the reason for this? My answer is: modern urban life is extremely unstable and is constantly changing. Those who are tired of material life and those who cannot find a way out in this changing life and feel distressed are increasingly seeking new miracles and new stimuli. The manifestation of this situation in art is the sudden appearance and disappearance of those so-called new trends such as Dadaism, Cubism, Fauvism, and New Sensationalism. At the same time, the rapid and ever-changing new decorative styles are also a reflection of this situation. Therefore, finally speaking, the standard of beauty is determined by the human way of life; the so-called relativity and absoluteness of the standard of beauty can only find a practical basis in human life.</p>
<p>Of course, saying this does not mean that everything that is useful to human life can be called beautiful. No, this is a wrong view of pragmatists. In fact, kerosene is useful to us, but it is not beautiful; manure is also useful to farmers in the countryside, but they do not recognize it as beautiful; ... Therefore, we can only say that all beautiful concepts are the products of human real life, and all standards of beauty are determined by human life, but we cannot say that everything that is useful to human life can be called beautiful: perhaps we can say that all beautiful things are practical, but we cannot therefore say that everything practical is beautiful.</p>

<h3>On Willpower</h3>
<p>— Manqian</p>
<p>Willpower (Will) is what expresses a person's strength.</p>
<p>When things come to a head, whether you will succumb or whether you will "give up halfway" depends entirely on whether your will is strong. There are many opportunities that can give your future great hope, but hesitation and procrastination, without any determination, cause those opportunities to drift away. I have also seen many young people who, because they cannot overcome the environment, finally fall under the enormous force of the environment. This is proof that they lack strong will.</p>
<p>Only through willpower can judgment be born. However, for willpower to be able to make correct judgments, it must pass through the net of reason. Only by using willpower extremely rationally can extremely correct judgments be made.</p>
<p>"Stubbornness" and strong willpower are two completely different things. Stubbornness may be a prejudice that is biased towards emotion, and it is often just a "preconceived notion." It is an internal traitor to the success of a person's career, ruining more than succeeding!</p>
<p>The highest realm of strong willpower is: being incorruptible by power and unmoved by poverty. For example, a master wants to harm his enemy and finds his servant. The conditions the master offers to his servant for committing the crime are high position, much money, and beautiful maids. How should the servant deal with this current problem under such a serious order and bewitching temptation? This requires him to bring out his inherent "willpower" to see whether willpower gains the final victory or whether the lure of material things gains the final victory.</p>
<p>So, how to use willpower? I say: first, you must have an indomitable spirit; second, you must be confident; and third, you must be deep and resolute. I will explain them separately below:</p>
<p>First, you must have an indomitable spirit. If you have already carefully decided on your will, you must do your best to promote it. "The head can be cut off, but the will cannot be bent"; "Success or failure, profit or loss, is not considered." You must know that any undertaking will never be without resistance; and the truly successful undertaking must first eliminate resistance or transform resistance into assistance. If a supervisor sees a strong enemy in front of him and does not inspire the morale of the army, it is unlikely that he will not fall into personal ruin and disgrace. He must first put the army in a position of no retreat, and then the officers and soldiers of the three armies can embrace the determination to break the cauldrons and sink the boats, and only advance and not retreat. The thing called willpower must be adhered to without change.</p>
<p>Second, be confident. For the steps that you have decided on, there is absolutely no room for turning back. People with talent have strong willpower, and their confidence must also be strong.</p>
<p>Columbus firmly believed in the theory that the earth is round, and people thought he was absurd and ignorant,</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>but driven by his self-confidence, the American continent was finally discovered by this person with strong will, who did not change because of the satire of customs.</p>
<p>Third, be deep and resolute. People cannot be without emotions, but the use of emotions must not exceed a certain limit. Otherwise, it is like an unbridled horse, running wild without end and impossible to control. Therefore, before handling matters, one must first adopt an extremely rational attitude, analyze calmly, and never allow emotions to act on temporary impulses. You cannot allow emotional impulses to ruin your future. You need to develop an attitude of "depth, resolution" and "restraint."</p>
<p>Industry Surveys</p>
<h3>Silk Industry</h3>
<p>— Yi An</p>
<p>According to the foreign trade reports of the Jianghai Customs over the years, silk and tea have always held the top positions in export trade. However, since 1928, while the tea industry has been able to barely maintain itself amidst constant losses, the golden age of the silk industry has become a relic of history!</p>
<p>Now that the silk industry is barely clinging to life, it should be meaningful to discuss the organizational situation of the silk industry in Shanghai, right?</p>
<p>In Shanghai, there are as many as 116 silk filature factories that meet modern mechanical reeling standards. Most of them are located in Zhabei and Nanshi, with less than 20% located in the concessions. Before 1928, it was the golden age of the silk industry. As soon as we stepped onto the edge of Datong Road in Zhabei, we could hear the thunderous sound of machinery shaking our eardrums. Each towering chimney spewed thick, foggy smoke, which filled the entire sky over Zhabei. From this interwoven scene of rattling machinery and pervasive smoke, everyone thought that the future of the silk industry was paved with a golden avenue. However, the reality before our eyes tells us that the silk industry has reached its final moment of twilight. What we will see in the future are more and more silk factories with court seals on their doors.</p>
<p>In the past, the huge capital power that held these 116 silk factories was mainly from the Wuxi and Suzhou groups, and the Huzhou group also accounted for a significant portion. The late wealthy merchants Hu Xueyan and Xue Runsheng were even giants in the silk industry. These former owners of the silk factories, who were once prominent in the silk industry, have either passed away or could not withstand the impact of the crazy economic depression, thus losing the courage to continue operating. As a result, the silk factories in Shanghai disappeared one by one like the morning stars at dawn. Now, only less than twenty factories are struggling to operate. Moreover, although these fewer than twenty factories are running, they are like sailing ships in a stormy sea, with the danger of capsizing at any time.</p>
<p>Speaking of the reasons for the silk industry's disastrous defeat, many people attribute it to their loose organization, lack of scientific management methods, and obsolete machinery, leading to low production efficiency and other problems. In fact, anyone familiar with the inside story of silk factories will deeply understand that these are still secondary issues. Because the organizational situation of general silk factories is not much different from other factories. If there is any difference, it is only because of the different production methods that there are slight differences from other types of factories.</p>
<p>The general organizational structure of a silk factory is similar to that of an ordinary yarn factory. Above the factory is a management office, which is in charge of all matters of the factory and all external powers. The interior of the management office is roughly divided into four departments: general affairs, business, cashier, and warehouse. The factory has a factory director, engineers, and foremen. All affairs of the factory are directly responsible to the management office by the factory director, and all male and female workers in the factory are subject to the control of the factory director.</p>
<p>Among these various positions with different responsibilities, the one with the greatest power and the most complex affairs is the "General Affairs" department. The daily salary of a general affairs director, generally speaking, can earn between 20 to 40 or 60 yuan. Next, the "Business" director, this is a talent who must have rich experience in the silk industry's commerce to be competent, but in terms of affairs, he is much more leisurely than the "General Affairs" director, so the remuneration he receives from the factory is not much different from the general affairs director. As for the position of factory director, it is very different. He must not only have very rich experience in the silk industry, but also be a technical talent who can actually work with his hands. He is responsible for all affairs of the factory, and in terms of production, he must have the skills to improve products like an engineer. Therefore, the factory's generous treatment of him is not inferior to that of the general manager of the entire company. Engineers are only specialized positions, and the highest remuneration will probably not exceed 100 yuan. However, in addition to receiving generous salaries, these many senior staff members also receive a large "bonus" at the end of the year, which ordinary workers dare not expect.</p>
<p>The workers' work is divided into departments by the factory in advance. The work of a general silk factory is roughly divided into the following types: workshop, silk room, reeling room, cocoon peeling room, and silk floss room. The number of people working in a workshop generally accounts for 70% of the total number of employees, and some workshops even have more than that. Secondly, the number of workers in the silk floss room and the reeling room accounts for an average of about 10% of the total. The work in the workshop can be individually divided into three types: long line, substitute line, and basin filling. The work of basin filling is entirely done by child laborers, with only one child laborer used for two machines. Long line is one person per machine. This type of work is mostly done by girls who are sixteen or seventeen years old to be qualified for this better-paid position. Substitute line cannot be regarded as a formal work department, because the purpose of this type of work is only to prepare for workers who are absent from the long line, and then replace them to work. Therefore, there is sometimes no fixed number of people doing this type of work.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the work on the long line is much more difficult than other departments. From the raw cocoons entering the pot, through the intermediate processes of silk reeling, distinguishing the quality of the silk, the size of the reeled silk, and the grade of the color, all these procedures that require sufficient brain power to do well must be done one by one by the workers in charge of the long line. Naturally, a long line worker's possession of this ability cannot be achieved overnight. An ordinary long line worker must receive at least three years of training to graduate.</p>
<p>The work in the silk room is also done by female workers. This type of work is very easy, but the task is conversely very important. The work in the silk room can be divided into two parts: joining ends and reeling silk. The work of joining ends is to take the rough silk picked out by the male workers, and then have them remove the rough silk and still connect the silk ends together. This procedure of joining ends is considered successful. The work of reeling silk is even easier and simpler. You only need to reel the strands of silk into a form similar to "crispy hair flowers" to complete the procedure of reeling silk. As for saying that their responsibility is important, that is because the final inspection procedure when a package of silk is packed is also handled by them.</p>
<p>The work of reeling silk is also not something that ordinary people can do happily. This requires picking out the cocoons of countless cocoons, selecting the quality of the cocoons, and listing the grades of the first, second, and third classes separately. But the work of cocoon peeling room and silk floss room is much easier. The work of cocoon peeling is a type of work that uses finger strength. You only need to peel off the outer shell of the cocoon to complete a procedure. Silk floss room is not suitable for unhealthy women. Because the silk floss has to go through a series of knocking, washing, and loosening procedures, if women with weak wrists, simply cannot be competent.</p>
<p>Among these many department's works, the best treatment is for workers on the long line. Because they can also be regarded as a kind of specialized technical talent among ordinary workers. Their daily wages are about 36 cents to 60 cents, and the most will not exceed one yuan. But recently, the wages are only between 30 cents and 40 cents, and there is no way to imagine the former generous income. The work of silk room and reeling room workers also only cost five to seven cents a day in the past. Now, they can only calculate half of the original number. As for the wages of cocoon peeling room and silk floss room workers, it is a kind of activity wage calculated according to the goods. A skilled female worker can earn up to about of dollars a day. A novice female worker, that simply can't be said to be wages, the result of working non-stop all day, roughly can earn about 200 wen a day.</p>

<h3>Freedom and Necessity</h3>
<p>— De Chong</p>
<p>Is human consciousness and behavior free, or is it limited by necessity? This has always been one of the most important issues of debate in the ideological world. According to general religious people and idealists, human consciousness and behavior are absolutely free and are not subject to any restrictions. They say: Man is the spirit of all things, and human consciousness can control everything and create everything. You see, are not all civilizations and all systems created by man? However, where does the consciousness and behavior of the person who creates everything come from? General religious people and idealists cannot scientifically and actively attribute it to talent, and finally hand over the solution of the problem to the mysterious God. In fact, human consciousness is formed in the environment in which it lives, and its behavior is even more regulated by the consciousness formed by this living environment. People in primitive times were subject to natural constraints anytime and anywhere because their production tools were very primitive, and they were slaves of nature. Therefore, they could only fight ferocious beasts in groups, and could only "eat raw meat and drink blood" to fill their stomachs, and "live in caves" to settle down. It is absolutely impossible to have the mentality and consciousness of living in a western-style house and eating a big meal, so they cannot have the action of making these things. In the past, in China's primitive agricultural society, people's lives were completely dependent on primitive agriculture. If that year was "good weather for the crops" and a good harvest was obtained, then they could live a better life, otherwise there was a risk of starvation. Therefore, at that time, the Chinese people could only place all their hopes on God, praying for "good weather for the crops" and a good harvest, and they would never have the consciousness and behavior of using scientific methods to make rain or using electricity to cultivate fields. Although in all the past Chinese fairy tales, there were Taoists who could call wind and rain, and immortals who could fly into the sky and escape into the earth, but this was just a kind of mysterious thought produced by people at this time when they felt the magic of nature but could not understand it, not a real thing. Therefore, our opinion is exactly the opposite of that of general religious people and idealists. We believe that human consciousness and behavior are not free, but are necessarily regulated by nature and society. People who live in a certain natural and social environment will inevitably have certain consciousness and behavior, and cannot have other consciousness and behavior. In this regard, human beings are slaves of nature and society, and their consciousness and behavior are not free, but are restricted by necessity.</p>
<p>However, people not only live in accordance with the environment, but also can change the environment to make their lives better and better. If people can only adapt to the environment and be slaves of nature and society, and cannot change and overcome them, then there is no such thing as human evolution. The evolution of human society is the result of human beings constantly fighting against nature and society. However, human beings' changing society and conquering nature are carried out under their understanding of the necessity of nature and society. The extent to which human beings can change society and conquer nature depends on the extent to which they recognize the necessity of nature and society. Within a certain time and space, if people can understand the necessity of nature and society, then they can freely deal with them under this understanding, and thus change from slaves of nature and society to their masters, and their consciousness and behavior can also be said to be free. For example, when we do not understand the necessity of water, we are helpless when we encounter the vast ocean. Conversely, if we understand everything about water, and thus know that ships will not sink on the water and can move freely, then we can take a boat on the water, and the vast river will not limit us. Here we can be said to be free. For example, in the era when feudal society was about to collapse and capitalist society was about to be born, if we did not know the necessity of social development and tried hard to uphold feudal society, then we would be like a mouse drilling into a cow's horn, the more we drill, the tighter it becomes, and eventually we would be pushed into the grave by the necessity of social development. Conversely, if we recognize the necessity of this society and thus determine our actions, then we will become the masters who lead society forward, and in this regard, we are free. Therefore, Hegel believed that "freedom is the insight of necessity." Engels also said: "Freedom is nothing but the domination of ourselves and external nature, based on the understanding of the necessity of nature. So freedom is necessarily a product of historical development." Because people can increasingly recognize the essence of objective things and understand their necessity, in the development of history, people can dominate necessity based on their understanding of this necessity, which is freedom.</p>
<p>At the same time, within a certain time and space, we dominate this necessity by recognizing the necessity of social development, and practically promote the development of society, making this necessity a reality. In the meantime, we become the masters of necessity because we recognize it, and thus gain freedom, and then practically promote the development of society under this recognition. Here, our recognition and practice become the main conditions for the progress of history, and freedom is transformed into necessity.</p>
<p>Therefore, freedom and necessity are not absolutely opposed to each other. We must correctly understand their contradictory and unified relationship in order to correctly determine our actions. If we only pay attention to the necessity of objective things, and think that under this necessity, human beings can only let everything grow naturally and have no way to do anything, then we are useless fatalists. Conversely, if we ignore this objective necessity and only believe in human creativity, thinking that human power can absolutely overcome nature, then we are unrealistic utopianists. Both are wrong. We must understand objective necessity and then dominate it in order to promote the development of society: such a correct understanding of the relationship between freedom and necessity to determine our attitude towards life and to determine our behavior.</p>
<p>We know that in primitive times, human beings were slaves of nature. Later, with the development of society and with human beings' understanding of the necessity of nature, human beings are gradually overcoming nature and dominating nature. By modern times, because of the development of industry and the invention of science, human beings are even more able to dominate the necessity of nature by understanding it. Now it can be said that nature has no major obstacles to human beings, and the so-called people who are slaves of nature have gradually become the masters of nature. However, even now, social relations still have great pressure on human beings, and human beings are still slaves of social relations. Therefore, if human beings want to obtain complete freedom, they must reform or improve this social relation in order to shorten the leap from the "kingdom of necessity to the kingdom of freedom."</p>

<h3>Human Anatomy</h3>
<p>— Qi Ming</p>
<p>Man, this is an animal that is neither big nor small. To say that he is small, then the microorganisms under the microscope, the single-celled protozoa, Amoeba, etc., are unknown how many times smaller than him. To say that he is big? Then he is several to tens of times smaller than the giant elephants in the tropical rainforests; if compared with the whales, the giant beasts in the sea, he is even more tens or hundreds of times smaller. Because the weight of a person is probably only around sixty or seventy catties to one hundred catties, while a whale weighs thousands or tens of thousands of catties. However, although man is just a medium-sized animal that is neither big nor small, the expression of his intelligent spiritual life has always become a mysterious mystery for philosophers to explore. Many idealistic philosophers regard human reason as a sacred gift, believing that this is not a kind of ability that the material world can possess, but a special expression of divinity. For example, Plato had long believed that man lives between the world of God and the world of form and matter, his body falls into the turbid material world, and his spirit belongs to the world of God. At the time when Darwin's theory of evolution came out, Wallace still insisted that the human spirit was an injection of spirituality. Even the modern scientist Thomson still said that the human spirit was suddenly discovered. Of course, the French encyclopedists of the 18th century have always firmly believed that the human spirit is like his body, based on natural matter, and his spirit is the manifestation of the functional expression of his material organization that is different from other animals.</p>

<p>Common Sense</p>
<h3>On Common Sense About Common Sense</h3>
<p>— Tan Ran</p>
<p>"You don't even have enough common sense, are you worthy of meddling in this matter?"</p>
<p>Such words are used by people in many places as a conclusive reprimand to others, which shows the importance of common sense in daily life. So, what exactly is "common sense"?</p>
<p>Regarding the question of "what is awareness," if studied according to a scientific system, there would naturally be very rich explanations of the theories and materials regarding the "common sense" question. However, since our readers are reading articles during their "spare time," we must find a way to start with the most clear and simple phenomena to raise questions about "common sense." Now, let us first tell a story:</p>
<p>Not long ago, there was an agricultural Ph.D. who had studied abroad and returned to his country. He was proficient in agricultural management and familiar with various agricultural technologies. He ran from a foreign country to his hometown—Gansu Province—and first invited several friends who were enthusiastic about business to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy dozens of acres of fertile land. He also spent more than one hundred thousand dollars to purchase several sets of electric tillage machines and harvesters from Europe. In addition, he ordered hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of fertilizer and seeds. After hiring hundreds of farmers, a new-style farm was quickly built. However, after a year, the agricultural Ph.D.'s business suddenly went bankrupt.</p>
<p>Friends all said that the agricultural Ph.D. had "bad luck," and the local villagers also discussed, saying that the agricultural Ph.D.'s "using foreign goods" was "selling out the country," so the result was naturally to be "condemned by Heaven and Earth."</p>
<p>In this matter, we can get good material. We first discovered here that the agricultural Ph.D.'s determination to actively carry out his business before the event was entirely due to his in-depth study of agricultural knowledge, and he resolutely carried out his plan with his extremely scientific agricultural "common sense." But his failure was not because his agricultural knowledge was insufficient. The problem was that his social and economic "common sense" was insufficient. Because the cost of his agricultural products was made up of fertilizer and part of the machine cost, it was higher than the products of ordinary local small farmers. Moreover, his large number of products could not be sold in Gansu for a while, and no one dared to bid at an excessive price. Therefore, he had to transport the products out of the province. However, the freight out of the province was extremely high. As a result, he had to hire laborers to transport thousands of piculs of grain to Shaanxi, but no buyers came to appreciate them. Finally, the capital turnover was not working, and the new-style farm had to collapse in the backward environment. In this experience, we clearly know that this agricultural Ph.D. can only serve as a technician in an advanced country with developed transportation and an unusually specialized social economy, and it is most appropriate for his specialized knowledge to guide the new-style farm. Because the "common sense" needed in that kind of environment is exactly the knowledge that this agricultural Ph.D. is familiar with. On the contrary, the reason why the small businesses operated by farmers in Gansu do not collapse but instead surpass the agricultural Ph.D.'s business is precisely because their "common sense" is suitable for that kind of environment. However, precisely because these "old folks" only understand the local phenomena of social life, and they lack scientific knowledge of the national economy and foreign technology or economics, they assert that the agricultural Ph.D.'s "using foreign goods" and "selling out the country" must be "condemned by Heaven and Earth." This is again because of insufficient "common sense." Because the judgment of "condemned by Heaven and Earth" is derived from the "superstitious concepts" of the old folks. Moreover, the agricultural Ph.D.'s "using foreign goods" is not for consumption, but for production. Logically, there is no "selling out the country." From this point of view, it can be seen that "old folks" only have "common sense" suitable for backward local farming, and their correct concepts of "repelling foreign goods" and anti-imperialism are hundreds of thousands of miles away. Their lack of "common sense" is exactly in line with the superstitious concept of "condemned by Heaven and Earth."</p>
<p>The interest given to us by such a story is that the lack of "common sense" or its failure to become widespread will inevitably make people confused and wandering in the complex and vast human society. If we can carefully pay attention to many daily events similar to this, we can almost always encounter people struggling in the suffering of insufficient or non-universal "common sense." What is the reason for this? Can "common sense" be made available to everyone? Under what circumstances can "common sense" be fully applied without omission?</p>
<p>To answer the above questions, of course, a few words will not be enough. Among the components of these questions, on the one hand, it contains the issue of the degree of human knowledge. And all research on common sense issues is inseparable from the scientific and universal education work in the process of human practice. In this short article, we can only put forward the following standards:</p>
<p>First, correct "common sense" should be allowed by science. "Common sense" should take the elimination of superstition as a necessary condition for its establishment.</p>
<p>Second, the methods and phenomena repeatedly manifested in daily life, such as clothing, food, housing, and transportation, do not belong to "common sense," they are the subject of habit. "Common sense" is a constituent of the simple cause-and-effect relationship in the complex phenomena and essence of things in the world. But it is not a specialized science, because the accuracy of science is established in continuous evolution. Therefore, "common sense" is only the knowledge that science has already solved. It is a tool that people need when they come into contact with phenomena on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Third, common sense does not belong to local specialized knowledge. People are often satisfied with their own specialized academic research, that is, they are confident that they have "sufficient common sense" and ridicule those who have not learned their specialized knowledge as lacking common sense. This is bound to fail. It is as erroneous as recognizing that such figures cannot become scholars without "mastering the encyclopedia." Therefore, we believe that "common sense" is the totality of various sciences universally dissolved in phenomena. Human "common sense" is directly proportional to the degree of social and scientific development.</p>

<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>. But they still dare not admit that humans evolved from natural matter, and that the spirit is also produced in that way. Therefore, they are still revolving in the theory of human nature that has been pre-existing in the universe for a long time. Regarding the human spirit, modern new philosophy has correctly recognized it in philosophy, that is, it recognizes that it is the product of long-term natural evolution, just like the human body, and there is no spirit without a material body. But right here, because practical sciences such as physiology, psychology, etc., have not yet reached a very refined, perfect, and sufficient explanation of the general mental state of people, those purely empirical scientists are still hesitant at this juncture and dare not resolutely deny the supernatural essence of the human spirit. Then, in the anatomy of man, how should we recognize this part of his mental phenomena? From the perspective of pure natural nature, the spirit must be attached to matter to exist, and thought cannot but have a physical brain first. Therefore, human spirit and reason are not the injection of spirituality or spiritual objects that suddenly change, but the result of the special functional expression of the special organization of matter that has been naturally evolving for a long time. If someone asks whether this argument is correct, then we can ask him to recall that people who have their heads cut off cannot only not think again, not become philosophers, scientific images, or moralists, but also cannot continue to survive? This is common sense, but this common sense is the scientific understanding of the mental phenomena of human anatomy, which is more correct than any theory of idealism.</p>
<p>The spiritual phenomena expressed by the organizational function of human natural matter are indeed very mysterious and worthy of surprise. In fact, its physical occurrence, development, and organization are equally amazing. The beginning of mankind is only a kind of reproductive cell. This kind of reproductive cell is called sperm in men and ovum in women. These can only be seen under a microscope. Such a large and ingenious thing as a human being has grown from that invisible small body, which has been clearly studied by modern science. Human sperm is only about one-fiftieth of an inch long in its entirety, that is to say, the original seed of human beings is only a small insect about one-fiftieth of an inch long. The sperm's ability to move is 3.6 millimeters per minute. Although it can live in the vas deferens for two or three months, it can only live for about ten days in the female body if it does not combine with the egg. The ability of human beings to produce sperm is very amazing. They can produce 126.25 million per week, and release 200 million to 300 million during each sexual intercourse. After the sperm and egg combine, they form a fertilized cell. This cell separates from one to two, from two to four, from four to eight to sixteen continuously in the mother's body, forming various human organs. The entire body of a person probably has more than 400 trillion cells when calculated in adulthood. The speed of its development in the mother's body, based on 280 days of fetal life, must be at least an average of 900 billion per day, which is an amazing number! As for the metabolism of these cells and how their division distinguishes the various organs of division of labor, these are specialized problems in physiology, so let's not talk about it. What we still need to talk about here is that cells are the unit of human body organization, but cells are not the ultimate quality. They are composed of molecules, and molecules are composed of atoms. I vaguely remember reading in a book that the atoms in the human body have a number as large as ten to the seventy-second power. This number is very difficult to write down on paper, so the complexity of the human body can be imagined. Indeed, if we regard each atom as a solar system, because electrons revolve around the nucleus, then the human body is composed of several solar systems that are more complex than the Milky Way in the sky. We try to close our eyes and think, we can imagine that people are an infinite group of flywheels, suspended there to stir and rotate, and can also be compared to a beautiful cosmic spectacle. However, what about between electrons and electrons, atoms and atoms, molecules and molecules? Then there are many gaps. If these electrons and atoms are squeezed into a pile, then a person who is four or five feet tall can become a small meatball the size of an egg. Such a strange human body organization expresses its spiritual phenomena through physical and chemical actions. Therefore, if it is said that spiritual phenomena are mysterious and amazing, then is its organizational state not equally amazing? Biological and cosmic material phenomena, man is the most subtle secret to the extreme. No wonder man can be called the spirit of all things.</p>

<h3>Between Grandfather and Grandson</h3>
<p>— Shi Ying</p>
<p>The cold wind howls in the winter.</p>
<p>At noon, the sunlight shines gently on the village.</p>
<p>A-hua lies peacefully by the bamboo fence gate, squinting her eyes. Wei-cheng and his old grandfather are also next to the woodpile, facing the sun for warmth; the old man with the white beard on his beard is over eighty years old, although his spirit is still vigorous, but the bronze forehead has been engraved with the marks of wind and frost, he is wearing a bloated old cotton-padded jacket, the indigo color has faded to white, and he is also tied with a blue as a skirt around his waist, and the white hair on his temples comes out from the felt hat with holes.</p>
<p>The old man's cough and choking closely followed; his face was flushed, until tears and snot flowed on his cheeks, and then he breathed a sigh of relief and wiped away the tears with his skirt.</p>
<p>——It's no good, people have lived long enough! Wei-cheng, I can't wait for you to graduate, I'm afraid I'll be gone long ago.</p>
<p>When the young man heard these words, he was really a little sentimental, and his heart was as desolate as winter. He said in his mouth:</p>
<p>——Grandpa, isn't it next summer?</p>
<p>But what the old man thought of was nothing more than what old people should think of: he narrowed his eyes and saw the young man who had grown up in front of him, with a strong and sturdy body, and an elegant and handsome appearance, which made the old man feel satisfied, ——Thirty years of painstaking expectation have finally yielded the harvest in front of him, although only the grandfather and grandson are left in the family. ——But in the end, he felt insufficient because of another thing. He regretted sending his grandson to school, isn't A-xi in the East Village the same age as Wei-cheng? A-xi's father is a grandfather with three grandsons. But Wei-cheng went to school and became strange, always saying that he would not graduate from the imperial examinations.</p>
<p>The old man's thoughts made him silent.</p>
<p>Wei-cheng knew what his grandfather was thinking about again. He ran into the hall, took a drawing board, ran back to his grandfather who was still in thought, and said to his grandfather:</p>
<p>——Grandpa, sit for a while. When the sun is good, I will paint a portrait for Grandpa.</p>
<p>——Alas, you students only know how to do these things!</p>
<p>When he said this, he agreed in part. Leaving his appearance to future generations is indeed a wish of the elderly, but the old man's greatest wish is to have a joyful and lively time again before he dies, hoping that his granddaughter-in-law will enter the house as soon as possible, and see them in pairs.</p>
<p>The wishes of the elderly are obviously a century apart from those of the young.</p>
<p>The young man was concentrating on the foot-width, facing the old man in front of him, and leaning over, using delicate strokes to draw on the paper.</p>
<p>The cold wind in late winter is just right. The sun leaked from the treetops into the shade, and the weather became extremely gloomy. The old man couldn't stand the cold before the sunset, and coughed more frequently.</p>
<p>A-hua stretched her waist and walked away by herself.</p>

<h3>Biography of Einstein (6)</h3>
<p>— Cong Mu</p>
<p>(5)</p>
<p>Einstein became a professor at the Kiliqi Institute of Technology in the autumn of 1912. Later, in the spring of 1914, he moved to Berlin. Therefore, much of what is said above happened after he moved to Berlin.</p>
<p>In Kiliqi, he was a full professor. The invitation to Berlin was to treat him as a full member of Preeson and a professor at the University of Berlin, with the same treatment as a full university professor. Before he arrived in Berlin, the Dutch chemist Van't Hoff, a professor at the University of Berlin, passed away in 1911, and he filled the position of this chemist; at the same time, he was also persuaded to serve as the director of the Physics Department of the Zhafeier Aim Institute. Such a position has always been given to the elders in the academic world, but at this time Einstein was only thirty-five or six years old, which was entirely due to the efforts of Blanck, Lalenster, etc. to recommend him.</p>
<p>At that time, universities in various parts of Germany were developing their own ways to compete for academic hegemony, but Berlin, as the center of German culture, still occupied a very important position. Now, with the addition of two major scientists, Blanck and Einstein, it can certainly be boasted, especially in physics. At this time, Einstein, who was in Berlin, separated from his wife who had married in Bern, and married his cousin, Airosha, who had loved each other since childhood.</p>
<p>Einstein's research on the general theory of relativity was carried out in Kiliqi in 1913. After 1914, it was continued in Berlin, and it was not completed until 1915 and 1916; after that, his research went further into the issue of cosmology. The results of these studies were mainly published in the Academic Senate of Preeson. In the meantime, the theory of light quanta was also a long-cherished problem for him. In 1917, in his paper "On the Quantum Theory of Radiation," based on the atomic model of Bohr, he used the leap of electrons from orbit to orbit to explain the divergence and absorption of radiation, and regarded the leap as a natural situation in the radiation phenomenon. Here, he introduced the idea of "confidence rate," and based on statistical equilibrium, he elicited Planck's law. This creative idea gave a very important meaning to the development of quantum theory; and based on the observation of the total solar eclipse by British astronomers on May 29, 1919, after the announcement in London on November 6 of the same year, the principle of relativity and the name of Einstein were publicized in the world.

<h3>A Brief History of the Development of Film (6) (Continued from January 11)</h3>
<p>— Wen Ying</p>
<p>(6) A Glimpse of Actors' Adventures in the Pioneering Era</p>
<p>The previous article briefly described "A Brief History of the Development of Film." Previously, there were five paragraphs disclosed in this journal (January 7 to 11 of this year). This is the sixth paragraph. In the five paragraphs mentioned earlier, the first paragraph talked about how film audiences, from the earliest period, were the masters who created the film industry. Now, the reason why the film industry has become one of the six major enterprises in the United States, and occupies a very important position in world art, culture, education, and many other aspects, is all due to the fact that our audiences are happy to spend money to watch and enthusiastically promote it. The second paragraph talks about how a Leland Stanford, in order to prove that a horse's four hooves are in the air when galloping at extreme speed, spent several years of effort to invent the linking of films, as well as the joint photography of many camera boxes, and further developed the fantasy of continuously shooting several films with one camera box. The third paragraph is about the great inventor Edison and his deputy Dickson, working hard on this fantasy, leading to the invention of the "animated peep show," as well as the grand occasion when the first animated film, "The Great Train Robbery," was released to the public. The fourth paragraph talks about the origin and rise of the "star system," as well as the first appearance of film queen Mary Pickford. The fifth paragraph talks about how the rise of the star system was due to the audience's worship of stars, as well as the hypocrisy of the publicity work at that time. After the fifth paragraph, due to the original text not being complete, the publication was temporarily suspended. Now, the original text is continued and will continue to be continued.</p>
<p>At that time, the spirit of adventure of several actresses was rarely seen in modern times, so we can mention it in passing. At that time, there was a female star named Alice Joyce. She was originally a supporting actress in stage plays. When she had nothing to do, she would work as an artist's model. Because the salary in the film industry was higher, she really wanted to enter the film industry. She fabricated a story, saying that she was good at riding, no less than a Kentucky jockey. The film company hired her because there was a shortage of female riders at that time. When it came time to shoot the scene, she was placed on the back of a horse and told to gallop forward in the middle of the railway track, capturing the dangerous situation of the train chasing the horse from behind. Alice had never ridden a horse once in her life, but how she did not fall to her death, nor was crushed to death by the train, even she herself was confused. But from then on, her position in the film industry was also stable.</p>
<p>The glamorous big star Gloria Swanson was also very adventurous at the beginning, holding her life in her hands to make movies. In one of Cecil B. DeMille's old films, there was a scene that imitated a famous painting, "The Lion's Wife." Although the scene was very short, the heroine had to walk into the lion's cage, sleep with the lion, and have the lion put its paws on her shoulders in a friendly manner. Of course, they could not be without considerable preparation. So, the side of the cage was filled with people holding rifles, aiming at the lion. However, Gloria herself also understood that if the lion bit her head off in one bite, it would be useless even if they killed the lion. Moreover, when many gun barrels were fired at the same time, it was difficult to guarantee that she herself would not be shot.</p>
<p>But at that time, Gloria was very daring. Besides, everyone praised her as an incomparably brave woman, so how could she be timid and retreat, ruining her reputation. She drilled into the lion's cage in this drunken state and started filming. Fortunately, everything went smoothly, but unfortunately, the camera had a temporary problem. When Gloria jumped out of the cage, the director told her, "Sorry, the scene just now was not shot well. Please do it again." This time, Gloria was so angry that she fainted.</p>
<p>Entering the cage for the second time was the most difficult thing Gloria had ever done in her life. Before entering the cage for the first time, the mental intoxication had already dissipated. That kind of courage was difficult to muster again. She already deeply understood that kind of cold danger. But she had to risk her life and walk into the lion's cage again. When she came out of the cage, she was almost so nervous that she had to be carried to the dressing room. On her shoulders were the lion's claw marks, and the beads on her clothes were crushed and embedded in her tender skin.</p>
<p>This kind of thing will not happen now. In this place, they can use a stunt double. At that time, they could not think of any other way except to risk their own lives. Katherine Williams was also a heroine who shot beast films at that time. She also held her life in her hands to make movies. Perhaps in that pioneering era, everyone, like the people of ancient times, was braver than the average person today. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>A Dog in "The Barretts of Wimpole Street" Earns 50 Yuan per Week</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>"The Barretts of Wimpole Street," which was shown at the Nanjing Grand Theater last year, was a collaboration between three major stars, Norma Shearer, Fredric March, and Charles Laughton. People who have seen it probably have not forgotten it. What is especially unforgettable is that dog. His name is Flush. Now I will briefly talk about some of his deeds.</p>
<p>He is a yellow and white Spaniel, born on October 7, 1931. His owner bought him to teach him how to hunt, but his owner later said: (The distance between his two ears is too wide, it is a pity to use him for hunting). That is to say, his brain is too rich, and there is quite a bit of meaning in calling him to make movies.</p>
<p>Flush was selected by the film company from 75 dogs of the same species, because his eyes are full of expression, and his ears are particularly long! The hair hangs down, as bright as silk. Before the movie started shooting, he was trained by a trainer for one and a half months. The trainer said that in his many years of experience, he is the best at understanding people's intentions.</p>
<p>During the training period, the trainer lived and slept with the dog, personally fed him, and gained his complete trust. His nature is quiet and does not like noise. The trainer taught him to move according to the instructions of the symbols. When training him to walk on the street, he used a 60-foot rope, called him to stand at one end, and the trainer slowly pulled the rope, and the dog slowly followed the end of the rope. After walking, he had a piece of milk cake to eat. He climbed the door because the trainer called him inside the door. He peered downstairs from the top of the stairs because the trainer drew his attention downstairs. But the performance came across as if he understood the plot.</p>
<p>Flush had to practice for several days for each scene he acted in. If the scene of that scene was in use, he would be given the same scene. The trainer was very careful not to teach him several skills at the same time, for fear of confusing his thoughts.</p>
<p>Flush and Norma Shearer had already become good friends. When she was filming Rip-Tide, he followed her around, and when Norma Shearer sat down, he jumped on her. In "The Barretts of Wimpole Street," they maintained their friendship.</p>
<p>But Charles Laughton could not develop a friendship with him. Because in the film, he is a strict father, and the dog is afraid of him and hates him. So when filming, from beginning to end, the dog walked past him and never looked at him. Moreover, in the film, Charles's loud voice and stern scolding made the dog feel resentful. But when Norma cried, the dog felt infinite sadness. When she laughed, the dog was also very happy.</p>
<p>Laughably, Flush is very dignified, and walks as regularly as an old pastor. He never asks for food. That may be because he is the head of the family. He has five children in his family. He earns a salary of 50 yuan per week, but he does not have to take care of the family, because the five children have been adopted by big stars.</p>
<h3>"Mutiny" Snippets</h3>
<p>— Zhi Shui</p>
<p>Director Frank Tuttle, who has a unique and creative style, has directed three MGM blockbusters, namely "The Thin Man" (this famous film was the first to successfully change the style of detective films, and it is said that it will be re-released at the Lido soon), "Eskimo," and "Forsaking All Others." "Forsaking All Others" was the first collaboration between Joan Crawford, Clark Gable, and Robert Montgomery. Now, these three silver screen lovers are coming back with a vengeance. Under Frank Tuttle's direction, they are filming the most cutting-edge romantic comedy of a love triangle in 1935.</p>
<p>There are five female stars in Hollywood whose decorations often lead the fashion in the United States. They are Joan Crawford, Norma Shearer, Greta Garbo, Constance Bennett, and Carole Lombard. But among the five beauties, Joan is the most outstanding, because her beauty can fully represent the model of modern women, so not only are men fascinated by Joan, but women also recognize her as the only angel.</p>
<p>The technique of background and color matching has a great relationship to the overall light and mood of the film. If it is not too dark, it is too bright. Too dark, of course, will cause viewers to feel unpleasant, but too bright will feel chaotic and dazzling. For example, in "The Barretts of Wimpole Street," the eighteenth-century historical background undoubtedly makes people think of a bleak and less exciting scene. However, the artist's skillful hand has made up for this shortcoming after all, and in "Mutiny," the use of various yellow, green, and coral-colored flower papers in our country reflects the infinite sense of relaxed, bright, lively, and beautiful pleasure. It can be seen that everything depends on human effort.</p>
<p>The wedding dress worn by Joan Crawford when she plays the bride is called the 1935 bride's style dress. It is an oval drooping edge, a rose stamen edge, and an apron, with a swirling wind and snow-like attitude. Even the veil is a handsome product. It is short in the front and long in the back, very beautiful. At the same time, a total of 62,400 pots of cornflowers were used in the auspicious ceremony.</p>
<h3>Chatting about "Willow Spring Breeze"</h3>
<p>— Guo Cheng</p>
<p>Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers have previously co-starred in the great song and dance film "The Gay Divorcee," which we have already evaluated. Their new film "Willow Spring Breeze"! It has now been transported to Shanghai.</p>
<p>This is a quite noteworthy song and dance comedy blockbuster. In addition to many stage stars showing their faces in this film, the director is still the song and dance director of the previous "The Gay Divorcee."</p>
<p>We are already familiar with Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, so here I want to talk specifically about the news about the 150 beautiful dancers. These 150 beautiful girls! All have undergone rigorous training in song and dance and are prepared to be used in the French Doll dance scene of Willow Spring Breeze. But because people feel that the girls' thighs are no longer very valuable, they hope that they can use their fingers instead of their feet to dance in slight movements.</p>
<p>Under such requirements, only sixteen dancers were accepted as qualified. It is really because using fingers instead of feet to dance is much more difficult than dancing on one foot.</p>
<p>"Willow Spring Breeze" is not worth noting for this point. It offers us many of the latest dance poses and 1935-style social dance poses, etc., which are very worthy of being taken as reference. In particular, the many songs composed by five famous arrangers that appear in the film are also worth mentioning.</p>
<h3>Major Reform of Electric Sound Weekly</h3>
<p>The Electric Sound Film Picture Weekly, which has been published for four years, has detailed news and photos about the secrets, undercurrents, and scandals of Chinese and foreign films in a week. Now it is heard that the ninth issue of the fourth volume of the publication will be further improved, with major reforms and enriched content. The cover will be printed in three-color version. Beautiful and pleasing to the eye. The price remains the same. It is heard that the eighth issue of the fourth volume has been published yesterday. The content is rich. Each copy is sold for only five cents.</p>
<h3>Reader's Letters</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Previously, I was entrusted to publish the announcement of our company's sound film "Orchid in the Empty Valley" giving away songs. After the announcement was published, due to the large number of readers of your newspaper and the success of "Orchid in the Empty Valley" at the box office, the number of letters requesting songs has been five or six hundred per day, and it is still endless. Now the 20,000 copies of printed songs have been completely given away. I am writing a special letter to ask Mr. to publish an announcement to readers that the distribution of the "Orchid in the Empty Valley" songs will be stopped immediately. Please do not send any more letters to request them. I am very grateful!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Star Film Company</p>

<h3>Schoolchild's Kind Mother (Grand Old Girl) (7)</h3>
<p>— Shu Min</p>
<p>Sandy drove for a while and suddenly stopped the car. He said to Gilly, who was pouting, "There's something I've wanted to give you for a long time." After he finished speaking, he didn't give her a chance to defend herself, grabbed her and threw her on his lap, and spanked her butt hard. Gilly was beaten by him, and beaten very hard, and couldn't help crying. Strangely, her crying was not out of anger, nor did she feel wronged, nor was it because of the pain. She realized that this time she had gone too far. Miss Belles had repeatedly warned her before not to go too far. At that time, she disagreed and said, "If I go too far, it won't hinder anyone else. At most, I'll harm myself!" But now she had harmed Miss Belles, and it was too late for her to regret it.</p>
<p>Gilly was spanked and obediently sat next to Sandy, returning to the city in silence. Sandy didn't speak for a long time either, but this silence had a different taste. Although he was afraid for Miss Belles's future, he had a new hope for Gilly's future.</p>
<p>The next day, Joseph Jerai convened an education meeting. In that meeting, everyone silently listened to his speech: "She used to ridicule us arbitrarily... She ate the public's salary and should educate children, not treat children as her experimental products... Therefore, I request... not request, I demand... that this old outrageous principal be dismissed... This is the only way to protect the reputation of our clean society!"</p>
<p>Lula Belles walked out of her school as usual, wanting to go home. She walked past the door of the "front room" and couldn't help but sigh, looking inside it was pitch black. Her efforts, her money, were all in vain. And on that door, there was a sign nailed, with the words "Education Bureau Sealed" written on it, which was her fatal wound. She looked at it and couldn't help but feel sad. Just at this moment, she saw Clarence Dade standing in front of the house across the street. Not wanting to show weakness, she forced a smile as if nothing had happened and said to Clarence, "Clarence, you have won again. You have defeated Arfontel again. I have been conquered by you..."</p>
<p>But Clarence Dade did not look gloating. He thought that this old woman really had some backbone and couldn't help but feel admiration in his heart. So he said, "I was just thinking... maybe you didn't do anything wrong... maybe I can also earn this money by selling ice cream alone... maybe..." He stared at her, feeling really unbearable. He continued, "I was thinking... I want to take over the "front room" and use it as a legitimate business. From now on, there will be no more "back room."" He looked at her with hope, and also with some self-reproaching bitter smile. Lula Belles couldn't help but say happily, "Clarence, you are really a good person. I feel like this is meaningful, no matter what happens."</p>
<p>They were talking lively when a truck passed in front of them, and a bundle of newspapers was thrown off the truck. Dade caught it casually, took out a newspaper, looked at it and said, "No matter what we become in the future, at least one of your students has a promising future." As he spoke, he pointed out the news in the newspaper to her. She took a look, and it said in large headlines: "The President is not coming to Arfontel." The smaller words below were: "The head of state issued a declaration on American foreign policy, shocking the world; although it is only about twenty miles away, he has no time to visit his hometown." They read that news and smiled at each other. Dade said, "Think about it, he was most shy when he was a child, and we gave him a nickname, called Little Girl. His words can now shock the world! I think you have at least some credit for this shocking thing?" Belles also laughed and said, "I wonder if when he is giving a speech now and forgets his sentences, someone is reminding him from the side." But Dade silently stared at that newspaper, and the smile on his face also disappeared. Miss Belles quickly asked, "What's the matter?" (To be continued)</p>
