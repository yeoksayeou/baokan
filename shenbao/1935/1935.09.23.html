<p>時評</p>
<h3>聞華北改編小學敎科書有感</h3>
<p>— 秉</p>
<p>日前本報電訊。謂津市府决改編小學敎科書。以適合於華北及津市各小學環境。此項消息。適披露於「九一八」日之報端。矚目及此。誠覺威慨百端。搔首撫膺之餘。不得不執筆而貢一言。</p>
<p>夫為某一區域特編敎科書。卽所謂地方敎材。小學敎育界中。固已不乏先例。大抵關於歷史者為鄉賢古蹟之叙述。關於地理者為山川風習之記載。其有不甚普遍之動植物。在尋常敎科書中罕或提及。而在本土乃至有繫於民生。亦別撰課文。備錄而詳誌之。則屬於自然科學者也。復有書商不忍放棄國土以外之營業。而國情不同。尋常敎科書難期合轍。於是特編一種敎科書以應之。如於香港·於南洋·書商皆有特編之敎科書。大抵於卷首刊載該土所屬國家之國旗或元首像片。而命意立言。亦俱不違各該國家之觀點。此為又一種之地方敎材。在書商以營業為最大前提。其出此也。亦自持之有故。然自敎育之立場觀之。以如斯之敎材。饗本國之僑胞。影響所及。直使僑胞子弟忘其祖國。甘為順民。卽斥為賣國。亦豈過分。而其書與前一種之地方敎材不可同日而語。自不待言矣。</p>
<p>今華北之改編小學敎科書。其取意將與後一種之地方敎材相類乎。我人據中國人之。自覺心興責任心推之而知其必不然也。然則與前一種之地方敎材同其旨趣乎。此乃實騐小學或敎育研究會之所務。初不必待行政機關之特事策動也。試觀電訊中有適合環境之言。卽知與前所舉二種地方敎材之編撰悉異其趣。環境限之。不為變通。斯無以適應。其變通以求適應也。茍自定最後之界限。界限以外。無妨舍棄。界限以內。决不放鬆。則改編小學敎科書之苦心且為國人所深諒。誰復忍加以苛刻之責備哉。</p>
<p>按敎科書之為用。在授與眞實之經騐。以期貫澈敎育宗旨耳。至如感情用事。叫囂謾罵。乃下乘宣傳文字之恒態。現在通行之敎科書。雖云未能盡如人意宜未必有是錯失。顧所謂環境也者不之許。改編之以求適應可也。抹殺眞實經騐而以無關宏指之材料代之。則斷不可也。此最後之界限也。凡屬我族之眞實經騐。苟為小學生所必需承受。仍宜不折不扣納入於敎科書。下筆固無妨極度冷靜。而叙述則不容少有歪曲。庶幾使展誦之者與全國小學生同其營養。不致陷於精神上之贏弱。抑有進者。敎科書工具也。工具自當期其盡善。而如何使用工具。以達到所懸之目標。則視工具尤為重要。今華北之小學敎師。其設敎也。殆亦將改易故道。適應環境。苟由此而漸就委頹。所言所行。遠離於敎育宗旨。則雖有優善之敎科書。其何能奏績。如或反之。小學敎師咸認己身所任為特別艱鉅之工作。精心研究。埋頭苦幹。神而明之。存乎其人。則雖敎科書略有未善。又何患不能收敎育成功之大效耶。</p>
<p>民國十八年四月二十六日。國民政府通令公布之敎育宗旨曰。「中華民國之敎育。根據三民主義。以充實人民生活。扶植社曾生存發展國民生計。延續民族生命為目的。務期民族獨立。民權普遍。民生發展。以促進世界大同。」其言美善。良可讚歎。我人願國士以內。凡與敎育有關之人。或編撰敎本。或從事敎學。咸記憶此美善之敎育宗旨。傾注心力。以求貫澈。勿令徒成敎育史之資料也。</p>

<h3>意拒絕五國建議　調解門戶猶未下鍵</h3>
<p>英法切盼意提對案　俾作為談判新基礎</p>
<p>（羅馬）外交部對於意國拒絕五人委員會之建議、已發表正式聲明、謂「內閣之决議、並非完全拒絕、他項建議之門戶尚開、無論在國聯範圍之內與否、皆可提出、而意國代表阿樂西且專為此事派赴國聯」云、（二十二日國民社電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）聯會人士相信、小組委員會或當要求意國政府、對於該國內閣公報所謂最低限度之要求、加以說明、該國亦當向小組委員會提出正式復文、而將該國見地、尤其是阿國改革計畫、該國擬在何項範圍之內、出而參加一層、必當詳細加以說明云、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）意國總代表阿洛錫昨以該國內閣會議所發表之公報抄本、送達行政院五國小組委員會主席卽西班牙代表瑪達利亞伽之後、復於今晨訪晤瑪達利亞伽、當就公報意義加以補充說明、但未提出書面文件、一般人解釋阿洛錫此舉、謂可視為意國政府對於小組委員會之正式行動、其對於該委員會調解意阿爭端之職權、不營加以承認、瑪達利亞伽接見阿洛鍚之後、當决定召集小組委員會於明日舉行會議、向之作一報告、頃聞該委員會屆時當就意國政府所提要求能否予以滿足一層、提出討論云、（二十二日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）據消息靈通人士稱、意國雖已拒絕五國小組委員會所提出之建議案、但未拒絕進行談判、此項談判須就性質逈異之基礎進行之、緣該小組委員會所提出之建議案、對於本月四日意國備怎錄所包含之後果、曁意國菲洲殖民地雜護安全之要求、均未能顧及之、自當另覓新基礎而依據下開各種積極因素、從事磋商、（一）阿國領土當加以區別、卽將該國本部與該國所征服之土地加以區別之謂、目下意國慾望所在、僅以第二項土地為限、（二）阿國當解除軍備、此項工作欲求實效、當在意國監視之下完成之、（三）他國以海口讓與阿國一層、當放棄之、緣阿國取獲海口之後、則解除軍備一事卽無由實現、又况阿國在一九三一年時、卽曾向意國提議、願以該國沃加丹省交換意屬伊里特里亞境內之海口、意國當時曾加以拒絕、茲若以他國海口畀予阿國、較由意國屬地界以海口尤屬不易監視、（四）一九零六年英法意三國條約對於意國在阿比西尼亞擴張領土之權利、曾加以承認、五國小組委員會似未顧及此層、他日舉行談判、自當以此為基礎云、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯會行政院五國小組委員會、頃於午後六時半舉行會議、研究意國內閣所發表之公報、當經决定暫行停止工作、一俟接獲該國政府正式復文與意見書之後、再行開會討論、據本社外交訪員所知、英國代表團方面以為意國內閣所發公報、對於小組委員會努力調處之精神、深為贊許、卽該委員會所提出之建議案、亦未堅决加以拒絕、以故和解途徑仍未杜塞、但成立妥協、障碍尚多、不容諱言云、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）意國政府於公佈拒絕五人委員會之建議後、曾立刻向法國大使館表示、謂意國之答覆或將引起國際之不安、希望法國總理賴伐爾竭力設法减除此種影響云、（廿二日國民電）</p>

，大家都是朋友，總要互相維持。我是個言責之官，根本上就不許可搭架子，什麽人都可以交朋友的。說着又微微點了兩下頭。介夫這一下子大樂，樂得幾乎要跳起來。不過當了這樣大人物的面，是不許可的，自己極力的忍耐着，身子還微微的聳了兩聳。則誠道：那麽，現在你可以去了，太晚了，恐怕他們已經睡了。介夫述說是是，二次又走下樓來。心裏可也默念着，見了賈多才周有容，却把什麽話去說呢？不如回到自己屋子裏喝一杯茶，抽兩根烟捲，就說是和他們見面了，便算糊弄過去。這樣想着，慢慢的便要向後面走去。樓上忽有人叫了一聲介夫。回頭看時，便見那位書記裘則誠高倚着欄干，向下看了來。便笑着向他點了一點頭道：我暫時回房去喝口茶。則誠道：何必回房去喝呢？（三二二）</p>

<p>經濟專刊羅斯東來  森禹　　（一）　　當白銀滾滾外流，中國飽受金融上極度痛苦之際，對於英國之所謂「好意（？）」援助的表示，似乎應該感激得五體投地！　　可是「好意」是怎樣？遠事姑置不論，就拿這次美國實施白銀政策時英國的實際舉動來看，我們眞找不到所謂「好意」何在！運送大批白銀出口的最主要角色，難道不是道地的英商銀行？老實說，他們運銀出口非爲單純之投機，實屬有計畫的搗亂行爲：它要把中國金融風潮　得更紛雜些，藉此可以加深中國人對美的惡感，並進而以種種之要挾，使中國投入它的懷抱，至少，企圖將中國的貨幣圈入英鎊集團之內。　　種種援助如所謂「借欵」「開發」等等，還不是都爲它自己着想！世界經濟恐慌更使老大的英國一天一天衰落下去，在中國的地位，巳不能如昔日之可以高坐第一把交椅；最近日本勢力大大擴展，尤給與英國以最嚴重的威脅，使它不得不慌張起來，而謀挽救之道。　　但國際關係過分複雜，使英國對華方策不得不極端愼重；應如何顧慮到其他各國的態度！尤其是應如何避免日本的阻撓？應如何說伏中國？！……這些，都爲英國政府必須策畫的要點。而羅斯之東來，也正爲解决上述諸問題的重要步驟之一。　　（二）　　不久以前，英國見到日本在華勢力之無限制的膨脹，於是唱國際銀團之復活，及所謂南京貨幣會議等等；這企圖：（一）藉國際共同行動以牽制日本之過度進展；（二），利用國際合作的烟幕，從中獲奪最有利的權益，如南京貨幣會議云云，便是攫取中國貨幣權的重要陣勢；（三），討好中國，使中國人知英國之如何關心自己，以維繫中英間密切關係，俾便於種種進取。　　可是這幾點卻完全失敗：（一），日本馬上給與英國以當頭捧，日本明白地表示中國是日本想獨占的中國（？），不容他國預聞，（二），各帝國主義間之利害並不一致，美法等完全知道英國之國際合作計畫是有種種企圖，自然不願受其利用，於是報以消極態度；（二），也許一部分中國人願意拉攏英國，但大多數畢竟己戳穿了英國的「西洋鏡」，所以中國方面對英態度並不表示怎樣積極，何况中國處於這樣複雜的國際瓊境之下，即使眞要投入英國懷抱，事實上也會受到巨大掣肘。　　（三）　　英國對於中國終不能拋開不理，羅斯畢竟先各國代表而東來了，而日到日己有多天，本月二十一日即可蒞臨上海。當羅期未動身之前，據聞曾與美國財界要人在倫敦會談；但英美兩大帝國主義的對立畢竟無法消除，在非正式的談話中，顯然不歡而散。羅斯本來預備來華途程中赴美與華盛頓當局一談，並擬和美國代表同行；現在，他既棄美而勾結日本，更可證明英美之合作己宣吿無望。而中國人之拘英美聯合制的幻想者，大概也可以甦醒了吧！　　國際合作旣不可能，以英國目前之環境，單獨對日又爲事實所不許；於是不得不復謀日英間之妥協，以共同分割中國市塲，在這樣的策略之下，羅斯之赴日，其重要性實超過來華萬萬倍！名爲奉派來華，而便這赴日；實際上毌寗謂赴日爲止，來華爲副，較屬恰當多多，　　外交家的態度雖模稜不可捉摸，但我們却可以從其口中及行動上反面的獲得相當事實；如果以英國所處國際環境為經，以羅斯最近在日言行爲緯，分析英國目前對日要綱——亦即羅斯和日本當局折衝條件，大約可作如下之猜度：（一）英國極願和日本妥協，英國承認日本在東北旣得權益，並不妨礙日本在華北及西北之進取；日本則不侵害英國在長江流域及華南一帶之勢力——簡單言之，即英國放棄華北之利益，日本停止華中華南之活動。（二）英國承認日本在華之政治的及其他經濟的優勢；但日本須不阻礙中國貨幣之加入英鎊集團。（三）對華共同貸欵。（四）英日共同對抗蘇聯，英國援助日本向外蒙進展；日本援助英國向新疆進展，以驅逐蘇聯在華勢力。（五）英國保證决不聯美對日，海軍比率上英國並將助日抑美；但須日本不侵害英國在太平洋一帶勢力，如一旦東非及地中海發生事故，日本並須保證英國殖民地之安全，以避英國後顧之憂。（五）其他商品傾銷問題之解决等等。　　這些，都為英國願和日本妥恊的要點，而尤以（一）（二）（三）（四）爲直接的中國問題。然而日本將怎樣呢？照我們研究所得，似乎不能爲英國樂觀：（一）日本抱獨占中國之决心，現且正由黃河流域南下而擴展視綫於長江流域一帶；至於日本之經營華南，不　為經濟的，且在未來太平洋戰爭上具有重忠軍事意義，故欲日本之讓出華中華南，爲事實所絕不可能。（二）中國貨幣權之得失關係商品推銷與資本投放甚巨，日本固將阻止中國加入美金集團，但亦不願英國之獲得中國貨幣權；它正積極地進行造成一遠東貨幣集團，以與美元英鎊等相抗。（三）對華共同貸欵日本早已表示不予歡迎，它以中日經濟提携的口號，拒絕任何國家之染指。（四）這一點兩國利害似乎比較一致，或有妥協可能；不過，日本對新疆之野心亦非淺，所以前途如何，自亦未能充分樂觀。（五）或有某種程度妥協之可能。（六）利害難一致，一時恐無解决希望。　　還有，日本必然會拼出承認「僞滿」問題，這呌英國爲難了；何况，在目前意阿形勢吃驚之際，英國正挾國聯以制意，對於國聯之「不承認」議案，自不敢首先破壞。這一問題，確也形成英日談判的障礙物。　　以上，關於瓜分中國市塲各點，除（四）或能「暫時」獲得相當妥協外；（一）（二）（三）主要三點，很少有協調之可能。這次羅斯到日，似乎並不受日本當局怎樣熱烈的招待，而日本當局所表示的態度，以及各方輿論，顯然是令羅斯失望，大亞細亞主義把羅斯袋中計畫打得粉碎了！　　自然，我們也不敢說英日在華之對立爲絕無妥協可能。英國旣不能獲得上述之理想，又無力和日本反目；在歐非形勢緊張之下，它史有遷就日本之必要。也許會英國會對日提出或已經提出：「英國不妨礙日本在華之一切行動；只須日本不侵害英國之固有權益」。同時，孤立中之日本，在對美對蘇之關係上，的確也需要英國的帮忙，所以，為不使英國全盤失望起見，或者會允許保留英國在華之一部分權益（但决不是全部）。　　這樣的妥協，無異英國對日之屈服，不過，倘使日本真能給英國保障在華一部分固有權益，那也未始不爲英人所聊以自慰；然而我們連一點也不敢爲英國樂觀到底。日本終極的目的在獨占中國，在某一階段上，也許會稍稍顧慮到英國的利益；可是，在必要時，它自然將不顧一切而蠻幹！最後，跟着日本勢力之愈益進展，英國（以及其他各國）在華勢力必然一天天衰落下去。　　總之，英日利害之衝突重重，羅斯赴日，欲求圓滿結果，實屬萬難！　　（四）　　羅期到了中國以後將怎樣呢？本來，倘使日本同意英國所希望的幾點，則羅斯在華工作可照預定計畫進行，簡捷得多；他必將以威脅利誘的手段，使中國屈服於英日分贓計畫之下。可是，現在羅斯在日受了挫折，因此，到中國以後的任務，不得不更覺麻煩。依照我們目前推測，羅斯到華除隨時隨地考察中國經濟情形外，大概將進行如下工作：（一）整理過去借欵與投資；（二）對華單獨新貸欵；（三）勸中國加入英鎊集團；（四）佈置反日基礎。　　讓我們來分析這四點的前途如何：（一）整理過去借欵與投資雖或不生問題，但手續麻煩，所費時間必多，羅斯和中國當局間，亦僅能决定一整理原則而巳。（二）中國當局的確很渴望借欵，但英國對華貸欵如爲無條件的，則資本無保障，必不願爲；如附有條件的或妨礙中國的主權，必將引起中國之反饗。况國際關係複雜，隨時有被其他各國阻撓之可能，固不僅日本也。此在過去事實，可爲明證者甚多。所以，即使中英間談判借欵，亦非秘密進行不可。（三）中國加入英鎊集團之實現性極少，一方面日美兩國必將盡力反對，一方面中國也未必歡迎；沙遜氏鎊劵計畫之失敗，即爲一良好經騐。（四）這一工作非常艱巨，决非草草所能從事，它的前途尤須視未來國際形勢的變遷如何而定。　　由此觀之，羅斯來華恐也很難完全實現其原來希望。羅斯固被人目爲一萬能之專家，然而人畢竟爲環境所限制，其如英雄無用武之地何！　　可是，我們不能說羅斯將毫無結果而歸，至少，他在日本所受的敎訓，和在中國考察所得，足爲英國政府極有意義的參考資料。　　（九一八紀念日）羅斯來華與國際借欵之展望  潘明珊　　英政府首席經濟顧問羅斯爵士偕財政部之巴志與英倫銀行專家羅傑士巳於九月十九日，離去日本在神戶乘上海丸歌程來華，約二十一日當可到滬。八月十日羅氏在倫敦瀕行前接見記者，據謂：赴華目的，乃在調查中國經濟現狀而報吿政府：並謂此次東行，足徵政府關懷中國之財政與經濟困難，且順道與其他有關係各國商討合作，製成具體方案，俾有助於中國經濟之復興，實爲最重要之目的，是羅氏來華之使命，負有對華經濟援助之計劃，實爲中外人士所共知。　　羅氏於九月六日抵日本，曾先後訪問廣田外相高橋藏相，及日本銀行總裁深幷等，關於英日提携及對華經濟援助等問題，曾數度探詢日方意見。至羅氏此次遍訪日本朝野，實有重要之意義在，自大戰後，遠東市塲，日本駸駸日上，英國之經濟地位，逈非日本之敵，目前英國所引爲急務者；一則援助中國經濟，俾恢復繁榮使賭買力强化；一則維持門戶開放下在遠東保持已得之經濟地位，以上種種，並請求日方之諒解。返觀日本所採用之政策，據外電所傳，日本外務省及大藏省　羅斯來日商討對華經濟援助問題之便，擬採下列四原則，與英國交換意見：（一）欲求英日關係調整，不僅提出中國之財政經濟問題，更須提出英國對於日本中國暹羅等東亞民埃之覺醒及發展作正確之認識，（二）日本有人口九千萬，希望英國將其地廣人稀之澳洲，新西蘭加拿大等殖民地開放，並不可妨礙日貨在以上各地之進出，日木可以中國「滿洲」等市塲求與英國協力，英國並許東亞爲日本活動之範圍，（三）要求英國將其殖民地內之原料予日本以公平之分配，（四）日本相信如英國對上列之原則不能承認，則對華之財政經濟計劃，欲求日本恊力，不過一零碎問題，距英日協調尚遠。總之：不外乎要求英殖民地之開放，一方並不許妨礙日本在遠東大陸之發展，氣燄之盛，使人難受，英之能否接受此項原則，實屬疑問。値茲意阿風雲，日漸緊張，一旦英國牽入漩渦，則武力有限，對於遠東香港新加坡印度等處未能兼顧，不與日方妥協，則難免日本勢力之侵襲，處境之難，人所共見，設種種計劃，不爲日方所諒解，或英國不能忍受日方所開示之交換條件，羅氏調查後，雖有優良之計劃，英政府一時亦難以採用，頗爲明顯之事實。　　我國爲獨立國家，各國因改良中國商業及財政地位，予以經濟上之援助，在我國則可用於生產建設，使國內經濟狀况得以稍蘇，市塲購買力可以强化；在貸欺者可增加貨物之推銷，維持已得之市塲，而我國亦可利用外資以謀生產建設之發展，雙方均有裨益，即總理所謂利用外資以發展我國之建設。英國對華經濟援助果具誠意，不必再徵求美他有關各國之同意，而羅氏此次東來，取道日本，遍訪日本朝野對於經濟援助之意見，是承認日本在東亞有特殊之地位，殊不知在目前之國際狀態下，英日對於我國之觀感，其步調實難强同，用再略仲其說，以見雙方之異趣。　　英日對於經濟援華計劃，頗難一致，在日本主張以經濟控制中國，實行其所謂亞洲門羅主義而成就日本旦夕所希望之中日「滿」經濟集圈。，英之所希望者則爲保持目前均勢下所己得之勢力範圍，不爲第三者侵入，且經濟援華者，不外乎投資，英旣夙望維持均勢下之優越地位，故曾沿襲四國銀行團例由英美法日聯合貸欵中國，俾優越之地位，得以維持而不墮，種種計劃，均本此原則而進行。而日本對於英美法日共同貸欵中國，百方設計阻撓，蓋觀中國爲禁臠，不容他人染指，遂高唱中日經濟提携以實現其亞洲門羅主義，排除列强在中國所得之權利，以遂其獨霸野心，故不贊成共同投資而從單獨投資着手，本年來中日經濟提携高唱入雲，並在華北各處，秤種生產計劃，如開礦植棉實業，由中日商人共同組織，從華北進行，逐漸推至華中各處。英則在遠東本有優越地位，見日本之銳意進行，不無恐懼，乃以共同對華經濟援助計劃，先行試探日方朝野之意旨，鈎心鬥角，各盡所能而爲俎上之肉者不知如何逃出此難關耳！　　國際對華貸欵由來己久，溯其已往之經過，則實濫觴於前淸宣統二年，中英美德法四國組織銀行團以東三省稅收為担保，借欵一億元，此爲銀行團對華貸欵之開始。迨民國成立。以日俄在遠東勢力雄厚，遂加入日俄二國，而六國銀行團因是成立，民二後袁氏秉政，目值二次革命時期，袁氏爲應付此革命高潮計，乃不惜訂立苛刻條約，向六國銀行團借欵二千五白萬鎊，但美國則放棄已往計劃，故實際上爲英法日俄德五國，此爲銀行團實際貸欵之始。歐戰發生，各國均牽入漩渦，德俄則無形間脫離銀行團

<p>自由談秋蠅  稜磨　　自來對於人物的評價，是很注重『蓋棺論定』的，這自然不僅指一個人到蓋棺，其一切行爲才可以結算，實也是要讓他的死亡，改變人對他的一些偏見。我們在聽到一個人的死訊的一剎那，往往有一種很淸晰的直感，把這人估價得很眞確。因爲這時候是不容許細想的，在這一瞬間，對這人的一切該遺忘的行爲，都儘量遺忘，而其値得記憶的事情，也自然侵入記憶。這一種感覺，也許並不能維持很久，但經過時間的消磨，則對這人留下的記憶，確常就是這些最初的記憶。擴大說，歷史的性質，也差不多就是如此，歷史家的任務，也不過是把歷史上人物的行爲，該遺忘的遺忘，該記憶的敎我們記憶罷了。而且歷史家在這方面權力也是極有限的，他們並不能怎樣發揮其自己的意見，而是時代自然產生這樣的結果。某一時代的當代的歷史家的記載，其價値往往幷不及後代的著作，其理由就是因爲後代的著作，更近於時間淘汰的結果。　　雖然自來有心作『君子』的人，都很服膺隱惡揚善的遺敎。　實上文人學者，都很豐於驕傲，輕薄的氣習，本來聖賢之所以爲聖賢，還是靠其能把同時人批駁得一文不値，才因而顯出其高，則學聖學賢的人，自然更可無論。出過一本小說集的人，往往想得明年的諾貝爾文學獎金，懂得A+B的人，早想像明年世界哲學會議稱揚他的論文，參加過網球比賽的人，會自選作網球十傑，再推下去，泥水匠阿四，也簡直看不起造二十四層大厦的工程師，同行是寃家，由來久矣！　　有些寃家，是會永久做下去，隋煬廣看着薛道衡的被砍下的頭，還問他現在還能咏『空梁落燕泥』小能？可見其忌刻到怎樣程度。但多數却總會隨時間消蝕。自己的生命力與他人的生命力，都是有限的，到生命衰退時，無論從別人方面或從自己方面，把這現象覺察，也就只能付之一聲慨歎。這情形無論對於大事小事，都是一樣，自然若從大一方面去找例來說明，可以冠冕些，但事實引起我這種感觸的，是一隻蒼蠅，　裏却不免只能說對蒼蠅的憎惡感情了。　　當夏天初來的時候，駡蒼蠅是很應時的文字，到現在秋天，蒼蠅已失去了的活動力，我們偶然在牆壁角發現一隻蒼蠅，每每激不起馬上取蠅拍來把牠拍死的憤怒，有時且能靜靜地伺察牠的仄促的生活形態，而不禁起些微微的憐憫。這憐憫實並不是純然爲了蒼蠅，多少曾把自身混在裏面。曼殊菲爾就曾有一篇題作蒼蠅的小說叙述一個事業失敗的人，看見墨水瓶內淹死了一隻蒼蠅，撈起來放在桌上，過一會，忽發現那蒼蠅已復活而在爬動，他覺得奇異，就把牠再淹死又撈起看牠再活，如此幾次，終於蒼蠅不能再活，而自己也頹然下去。我們雖未必也曾見到淹死的蒼蠅而起同樣的感慨，但見到垂死的秋蠅，其感想是相似的。這感想多少對我們有一些價値，因爲這或者可使我們覺悟把自己在局中的地位撇開而專起茫然的憎忿的不當吧！水災與文學  屈軼　　日來無意中讀了兩首詩，一首是孫毓棠先生底洪水，一首是八指頭陀底鄭州河决歌。讀了後，我覺得有個顯著的對比。雖然前一首是白話詩，後一首是文言詩，但我們還能從它們底技巧與內容底現實性上來對比一下。　　孫先生詩開頭就把這「洪水」的原因推給老天。當然，現代的詩人，决不會眞的是老天的崇奉者，不過表示他無可奈何之情而已。他寫着道：　　「是誰冒犯了上蒼，誰造的孽，　　敎長河大江汜濫出洪流？怎麽這　　白茫茫一片莽蒼遮沒了大野，　　滾滾的濤花敎地連了天？誰狠心决了天河潑出這無垠　　無量無盡的水？看老大千萬層黑灰　　也包不住上蒼懲罰的沉重——是誰　　違叛了這至高唯一的撼不動的意志？」　　這雖然是詩人無可奈何之情，但宿命論的思想是濃厚的。詩人自己還向在平和自然的生活中過去，沒有想克服自然那份勇氣也是顯然的。從這出發，詩人不但不詛咒這洪水，反從它「奇譎的美」上，聘着想象，舖張詞藻起來。使讀者絕不感到大水的悲慘，反而覺得這大水的雄偉。　　「白浪的浪峯推着浪谷，　凝雪的　　　濤飛堆上半天，又像是千軍萬馬，　　掃蕩過一帶大荒原——誰敢來阻擋？　　像剛破曉時分大海上吹颱風，　　這一片水連了雲天，天蓋住水：　　湮沒了大野，森林，埋了邸山，　　塞了幽谷；你分不淸山野何處有凹凸，　　只億萬里波濤抖動了捲花的浪，　　歡和着滂沱的大雨笑得猖狂！　　這里只有水天的交合，一片沒顏色的　　混沌——上蒼要責罰也給世界　　一個宇宙中單純奇譎的美！」　　這一來，水災所給與我們的創痛，全給撫摩平了。雖然我們的詩人以下還轉到：「田園，綠竹，閭里，疏花，百代的安樂，文會薈萃的城郭」甚至於「鈎去了牛馬羊的靈魂，收羅盡燕雀鷲鷹」幷涉及「老弱嬰兒，流屍……」但詩人却作了個婦結，說道：　　「是誰造的孽，誰開罪了天蒼？　　天蒼狠住心敎洪水來刷洗，洗盡了　　國鬭與鄕爭，人慾的　　，和一切　　歡喜，憂愁，愛，憎，和嫉妒……　　啊天蒼！」　　至於詩人自己呢，他不求孤舟，即鴻毛也還重過他的生命。如果茫茫是生，他生不如不生，他祗求在旋浪里有一刻喘息：　　「向億萬生黨滴雨滴湖淚。」　　這感情又如何脆弱。我們在這詩里，確實看到了我們詩人想象底豐富，技巧底圓熱；但同時也看出了我們詩人底軟弱無力！我們底詩人祇是個宿命論者，是祇看到自然，而沒看到了人事與自己！　　但在他底立身處世上理應是個宿命論者的八指頭陀，是怎麼寫他底歌呢。我們不妨把全詩抄下來　看：　　「嗚呼，聖人千載不復生，黃河之水何時淸？濁浪排空倒山嶽，須臾淪沒七十城，蛟龍吐霧蔽天黑，不聞哭聲聞水聲。天子宵衣起長歎，詔起師臣出防捍，帑金萬鎰塡洪流，黃河之工猶未半。精衛含愁河伯怒，桃花春泛益汗漫。明廷下詔罪有司，　有司椎胸向天悲！吁嗟乎！　時事艱難乃如此，余獨何心　惜一死，捨身願入黃流中，　抗濤速使河成功！」　　在這里，第一，八指頭陀，是把水災歸結到人事上的。第二，他還把治河者們的罪惡，隱約的指出：天子責有司，有司悲天，而人事終不之盡。八指頭陀於現實是有他相當的把握的。和我們新詩人底詩一比較，前者是力求文字之工，僅注意於技巧的成功，而忽略了現實的把握，後者是滲透了現實，不禁有感而發；技巧僅作爲表情達意的工具而已。故前者成爲應景文字，而　者却可說是血淚的呌喊。前者是向自然屈服，後者是想克服自然。前者祇求：　　「向億萬生靈滴雨滴淸淚。」而後者却　　「捨身願入黃流中，抗濤速使河成功！」　　詩人態度之軟弱與强頑，亦可作一很明顯的對比。　　也許有人以爲我這些話不足爲訓。洪水一詩，寫的並不是現在中國今日的水災，而是聚經中出埃及記底複製，不過剛巧出現於水災偏地的現在大公報文藝副刊上而已。同時，也許會更進一步的譏笑：爲百萬生靈滴淚倒是實在的，而捨身抗濤，不過是效朴工部「安得度厦千萬間，大庇天下寒士俱歡顏！」句，是一種感情的誇張。這種不兌現的支票，誰又不能出呢。　　其實這話也似是而非。我們祇要返問我們底詩人，爲什麽不可以把題材從太古拖到現在，從西歐拖到中國來呢？我們的詩人爲什麽不放眼到現實上去呢？至於捨身抗濤，說是感情的誇張；實際上，細繹原詩，詩人之意却在反擊人事不當。詩人不是說過「時事艱難乃如此嗎？何况「同情」是文學底最大的生命。藝術至上主義者王爾德也說過：「俄國作品是好的，因爲它富有同情。」如其我們的詩人，不想把自己作品在象牙塔里　祭品，應該立刻放棄技巧的雕琢，跑到十字街頭，在現實底實踐中，擴大同情。無同情，即無文學。　　水災是偏了中國，我們底詩人和文學家到哪里去了呢？岀海還鄉  子岡　　前一個月光景，自己爲了接一個初來北平的弟弟，不顧溽暑支着帶病的身子到車站去。時間還早，便在站房的玻璃屋頂下徘徊，看那裏陳列着的國貨商品，像筆墨，繡枕，……　　天氣是熱得呌人腦袋發暈，站上的人聲討厭得和蒼蠅一樣，嗡嗡嗡的。給人們休息的長凳上不停的有人坐下站起，比較舒適的人到酒悱間去了，這裏是　着粗布袋的漢子，餵孩子的女人，以及穿着灰布大褂偵探似的一羣羣的男人。　　看着時鐘離車來的時候還有一刻鐘，我坐到一個獨行的女人的身邊來。　　側過臉來，才看見那女人的　子裏纏着紗布，許是因爲那裏面還在滲出濃水的原故，一只蠅子正眷戀着它，撲一陣飛走，飛走了又來。　　我下意識地抬起右手來揮了一下，那女人回過頭來，才呌我瞧淸楚，是一個又黃瘦乾枯的臉膛。一些粗大的麻點和那左眼角上的疤痕驀地閃到我眼裏，心動了一下。　　這隻臉子是熟悉的。　　用盡了一些思索，才慢慢恍然過來。　　「您貴姓——是孫麼？」終於那麼隨便地問了出來。　　女人驚訝地注視着我，泛白的眼睛睜大了點，却依然是那麽無神的，只覺得病容更深了　　「是的呀，怎麼知道？……」　　「您敎過師大附屬幼稚園——不，那時是呌蒙養院？您教過我哩！」　　舊事都在我們之間復活起來：一羣羣四五歲到六七歲的孩子，來了學校不用書本，却學點歌兒，作點遊戲，聽一點先生口裏講出來的故事，到放學，排了班一列列地走出去，向先生道再見。那時候的先生在孩子心裏比父母還大，每個舉動每句話都要博得先生的誇獎才舒服，態度是摯誠地的。　　鞦韆，滑梯，積木，泥人，洋娃娃……　　不知是一種什麽情感驅使得這女人的臉紅了起來，摔動着眼角：　　「是的啊，你在前幾年？」　　「有十三四年了吧，我呌×××」我好容易才算出年代來，那些舊事不抓起來時眞彷彿是一些在春風裏浮漾的飛絮。　　女人撫看額角，吃力地送過一阪嗆咳：「哦哦哦，你作過班長的哩，你們畢業時，一班曾排過「葡萄仙子」？後來你弟弟不是也上過學麽？有一回淘氣玩槓子跌了下來，嚇得我直出冷汗。你都這麽大了啊……還認識我？」　　我告訴她曾有一次去舊日的學校玩——我是跋踉蹌蹌冒充家屬模樣進去的——校址擴大了，孩子也多起來，舊有的先生全不在，換了陌生的臉龐。　　「在這裏我居然碰到了老同學，她們說常在街上碰到您，就是不知道您的近况。」　　黃臉依舊恢復過來：「好孩子，在街上碰見我也不招呼，你們是由孩子長到成人，呌我哪能認出來，但我——三十多到四十多只是更加蒼老吧了。」又想了想，「我離開那學校有五年了，哎，人一老是眞糟，……我是被一個繼任的主任撤職的，原因是我的人和我所學的東西全衰老了，可是呢，自己也聽得出來嗓子是沙啞了，琴音蓋住了我的喉音，孩子也是喜歡年輕漂亮的先生啊！」　　像聽一支悲慘的曲子似的，我呆住了。　　「那麽，以後呢？」　　「我在親戚家寄住了這九年，自己的錢也快花光了，如今又生了這成串的癧子筋，治了將近一年，看看不會好，便想回家鄕去，雖然家鄉沒有什麼親人，但還淸靜點。」說至末尾，聲音是那樣低暗，我把目已的事吿訴了她點，她把一隻柴梗似的手蓋在我膝上，有一些顚抖。乾嗆不住地摔得那背脊前後仰動。　　末次報吿鐘響了，我站起來道再見。　　差不多要掉下淚來才迸出幾句話：「等會見看你弟弟吧，我的車還早着。」　　爲了和弟弟握手時的歡快和招呼行李時的忙亂，終於把那囑託忘了：沒有領他到孫先生坐的長凳邊去。　　我是那樣悵悵地詛咒着自已的記性。寄宿舍（五）  Ｊ·喬易斯作立波譯　　他們常常每人擎一支燭，尖着脚一道走上樓去，走到第一個樓頭上雅不願意地互相道別。他們常常親吻。他很淸晰地記起了她的眼睛，她手的　觸和他的心醉。……　　但是心醉過了。他唱和她那一句話，應用到自己：「我怎樣辦呢？獨身者的本性勸他抑止。可是罪已經有了；就是廉恥心也吿訴他這樣的罪償報是必要的。　　當他和她正坐在床緣緣時，馬利走到門邊，說太太在客廳裏要見他。他站起來穿起上衣和背心，比以前史加無力了。他穿好了有服的時候，走到她的面前，撫慰她。事情會很如意的，不要怕。他了開時，她正在床上哭泣，柔和地悲嘆：「呵我的上帝！」　　走下樓梯時，他的眼鏡被水氣弄得這樣糢糊了，他不得不取了下來揩拭一下。他很想爬上屋頂，飛到另外一個國度去，在那裏他再不會聽到他的煩惱了，可是有一種力把一步一步地推下樓去。他的老板和馬丹的難於和解的面孔耽耽望着他的狼狽。在樓梯的最後一段上他硬到了正從伙食房懷着兩瓶巴斯啤酒同來的賈克，莫里。他們冷淡地招呼一下；這位愛人的眼睛在這個粗大的猛犬樣的臉上和那一雙又粗又短的手臂上停留了一兩秒鐘。走到小樓梯脚下的時候他向上而望去，看見賈克正在廻廊的門口看他。　　突然他想起了一個音樂廳的藝人，一個小小的漂亮的倫敦人，向波利投以放縱的諷示的那天晚上。那一次聚會幾乎被賈　亂暴破壞了。大家都竭力要他平靜。音樂廳的藝人，比以前稍爲蒼白一點，微笑着，說他沒有什麽惡意：可是賈克繼續向他嚷着，如果有任何人要那麽嘲弄他的姐姐時，他要狠狠地咬咬他的喉嚨，他要這樣。　　波利在牀緣上坐了一陣，哭泣着。終於揩乾了眼睛，走到鏡子面前。她把面巾的一頭浸在水壺裏，用冷水恢復她的眼睛。她側面地望着自已，整一整耳上的髮針。她又回到牀上，坐在牀脚邊。她把枕頭諦視了很久，看見牠們喚起了她心裏秘密的可喜的記憶。她把頸項擱在微冷鐵牀橫條上，沉人了凝思。在她臉上出看不出困擾了。　　她耐心等着，差不多只有愉快，沒有驚動，她的記憶漸漸被將來的希望和幻想擠走了。她的希望和幻想是這麽錯雜，使她再也看不見她諦視着的枕頭，也不記得她在等待什麽。　　終於她聽見她的母親在叫。她跳了起來，跑到梯關邊。　　「波利！波利！」　　「唔，媽媽？」　　「下來，親愛的。多蘭先生要和你談談。」　　於是她想起了她是在等待什麽。（完）</p>

<p>Page 16</p>
<p>痛。這種頭痛如祇用止痛藥醫治，不免是緣木求魚。認眞治療梅毒才是根本辦法。　　（Ⅲ）頭痛由於局部　　（一）眼受累眼睛是一種自動照相器。眼光好的多用也不受累。眼光不好的，如近視，遠視，散光等，看書視物眼睛加倍費力，大腦後部司視的神經也特別多出力，故發生頭痛在頭之後部與眼的周圍。頭後部痛由於神經受累，眼周　痛由於眼肌受累。注意這是一種平常的原因，用功的學生與終日用眼生活的多是患這種頭痛。配合宜的眼鏡就是對症的治法。　　（二）耳鼻喉發炎病　中耳炎，內耳炎，耳後乳突骨穴炎，鼻內各　急慢性炎，喉部炎，多可放射痛到頭部。醫治以直接治療各病爲主。　　（三）顱內病腦膜炎，腦炎，急慢性顱內　脈　栓症頭都發生頭痛。腦內或腦膜內生瘤最顯著的病狀就是頭痛，由於顱內壓力加增。治療常以各症爲目標　　（Ⅳ）偏頭痛（Migraine）　　偏頭痛是一種神經官能病，似有定期發生，病來前患者常稍覺不適，繼劇烈頭痛發作，痛常是頭一邊較重，亦常臨時繼以眼目昏花，惡心嘔吐等病狀。經一日至數日漸可全愈。　　這種頭痛的原因不十分一定，大槪起於幼年。遺傳性也有些關係。女性多於男性。室內及多坐生活也易使此病發作。直接引起此病最要的是消化道不適，如飲食過度，長時間受餓，大便閉結，其次如身心疲倦，感情刺激，眼睛受累，睡眠不足，缺少新鮮空氣等。　　治療偏頭痛臨時可服適當止痛藥及靜養，病愈後宜注意：（一）較多戶外運動，（二）簡單合身飲食，（三）通大便，（四）其餘普通衛生。如此行多可防免偏頭痛再發作。止痛的藥物　　以上己詳述各種疼痛病的治療原理與方針。止痛的方法有的須用止痛藥，有的不須用止痛藥。止痛藥也不　當馬馬虎虎的服用。須知這一類藥品用的得當是痛苦病人的臨時救星，用的不得當雖可敷衍一時，但到底輕的傷身，重的遺害無窮，使患者永久成麻醉品的奴隸，於個人則敗身裂名，傾家蕩產，於國家則亡國滅種。望國人切實注意止痛的方法與各種止痛藥物庶不致掉入苦海當中。　　止痛的藥物可分爲以下五種：第一種是麻醉品。第二種是止痛藥或稱鎭痛藥。第三種是催眠藥。催眠藥雖不特別止痛，但有輕痛時如能朦朧的睡去也就可以了事。第四種是蒙藥麻藥。第五種是局部止痛作用藥品。各有各的正當用途，不宜隨便服用。牙齒常識問答（二）  林鑑賢　　（第五問）食物經過咀嚼後形態上起什　變化？　　（答）我們的食物，大的硬的乾的粗糙的各色都有，不能囫圇嚥下。在咀嚼的當兒，一方面牙齒把各種食物嚼細，一方面口中的唾液，源源出來，把乾燥的食物濕潤。所以一切粗硬乾燥食物，經過咀嚼，都變爲細爛潤滑的糜糊，極易嚥下。這就是形態上的變化。　　（第六問）形態上的變化有什麽好處？　　（答）上面已經說過，食物到了胃裏，胃液就慢慢的把牠一層一層的浸蝕，直至溶化爲化。若是食物嚼的細爛成糊，這溶解工作就很快。譬方像二分厚的一槐肉，要四小時方能溶解；若是嚼細成一分厚的塊子，祇消二小時就能溶解了，所以食物形態上的變化越充分，在胃裏的消化就越容易了。　　（第七問）食物經過咀嚼後，化學上發生什　變化？　　（答）咀嚼時候出來的唾液，除了濕潤食物之外，還有兩種化學作用。（一）糖化作用，就是能够把含澱粉的食物，像米飯麥麵等，一部分化爲葡萄糖。我們嚼白飯不和菜的時候，常覺發甜，就是這個緣故。（二）鹼化作用，就是把食物化成鹼性。　　（第八問）化學上的變化有什麽好處？　　（答）澱粉類的食物，先要變成葡萄糖，纔能吸收入血，去做滋養料。所以糖化作用，很能帮助這類食物的消化。至於鹼化作用的好處，就是因爲胃液是酸性的，牠必須要帶鹼性的食物去激刺，纔能够多量的分泌出來去做消化工作。酸性胃液多量的分泌，又能惹起腸甲鹼性消化液多量的分泌，食物的消化，因此更得圓滿。　　（第九問）咀嚼還有別的好處沒有？　　（答）還有兩種好處，（一）增加食物的美味。因爲食物的一切味道，只有在咀嚼的時候，可以領略得到；過個咽喉，就不覺得了。若是狼吞虎嚥灌注式的吃法，那末珍饈之味，也和藜藿一樣了。（二）咀嚼旣然能增加食物的美味，牠就因此還能引誘消化液的多量分泌，增加胃腸的活動，使身體多得到食物的實惠。　　第二節　細嚼的利益　　（第十問）照這樣說來，咀嚼在食物消化上，豈不是占很重要的地位嗎？　　（答）不錯，咀嚼確是很　緊的。換一句話說，口消化是很要緊的。她和胃腸的消化，有密切的關係。若是食物在口內有充分的咀嚼，得着唾液多量的混和，上述形態上和化學上的變化能够充分，牠在胃腸也就能够充分的消化和吸收。若是食物的口消化不完全，胃消化就要遲慢。胃消化旣不順利，腸的消化和吸收也就不能順利了。尋常人只知道胃腸消化的重要，却不知道口消化在生理上有意想不到的意味。可以說是食物全部消化的第一關鍵。周夢白林鴻藻國產之藥用植物（三）  周夢白　林鴻藻　　（四）蒼朮Atracty　is　Ovate　Thunb　　植物　野生於山野，多年草也，莖高約30-60公分，葉互生，有柄，上葉爲卵狀橢形，邊緣有刺，銳尖頭，下葉爲3-5裂或3-5片之複葉，頂生頭狀花，夏秋之際，有魚骨狀之總苞，開白花或淡黃色之花。　　生藥　芥朮Rbizcma　Atractylis採集其根莖而乾燥之者也，其副根大都切除，而現瘢痕，爲不齊分歧，根頭則殘留殘莖　莖痕，外面皺縮，呈黃褐暗色，往往被有白色之粉塵，破折面有黃白色，乃纖維性不平滑，有芳香性，味初甘微苦，其橫斷面，殆圓形，質粗鬆，全體爲淡黃色或黃褐色，抱層呈暗褐色，皮部極薄，脈管部成黃色之放射綫，分泌物貯藏器，亘於全　，以廓大鏡得能認明之，置橫斷面於顯鏡檢之，其抱層由十層內外之抱細胞而成，其內層抱細胞著顯明膜壁厚化，皮部及木部之多數細胞，含有針晶，又有巨大分泌物貯藏器，木部脈管間有纖維束。　　白朮Radid　Atractylis　alta卽剝除其抱層而乾燥者也。　　成分　根約含有1.5％之精油，精汕之主成分，爲Atractyblol　C15Hz4O他含有Atractylon　C14H18哥等，後者有蒼朮特有之香氣，精油中之含量，大約20％，有二重結合三個，乃極不定之物也。　　藥理　芥朮精油對金蛙，少量現鎭痙作用，僅亢　反射機能，大量則侵襲中樞神經，呈麻痺作用，由呼吸麻痺而致死。　　藥用　本品爲芳香性健胃藥所常用，其他室內燻蒸用，有除濕氣之效，止霍亂吐下，暖胃，消穀，進食，除濕，發汗，健胃，安脾，治痿　藥。　　（五）天名精　Carpesium　abrotanoides　L．　　植物　天生於原野，及路旁之處，爲二年草也，莖高約一公尺（米），全株密布細毛，根葉闊大爲席卵形，其葉緣爲不整齊波狀，莖葉互生，有柄，爲長橢形，上面皺縮，葉級鋸齒狀，頭銳，夏秋之際，　苦色之頭狀花，果實爲瘦果，銳尖頭，嘴端有小冠。　　生藥　鶴虱　L．Fructus　Carplsu乃採集天　精之果實者也。　　藥用　專供驅除　虫用，作煎劑服。處方例鶴虱丸有　蛔虫心痛効，　　鶴虱一三·〇　吳朱一九·〇　桔皮桂皮各一二·〇　　檳榔一五·〇　　以上五味爲丸劑，加大黃則增加其効力，　　檳榔鶴虱散，　　鶴虱當歸桔梗芍葯桔皮各三·〇　人參桂心各二·五　檳榔四·〇　以上爲煎劑二〇〇·〇，一日二次分服。耳鼻喉眼衛生常識  唐仁縉　　（六十四）　急性結膜炎　　所謂急性結膜炎者，就是一股俗間所稱爲的紅眼或赤眼。在眼病當中，很占多數。牠的統計，未必少於砂眼。牠的原因。多由理化學的刺戟及由傳染而來。理化學的刺戟，可以別爲（一）外傷（所謂外傷性結膜炎），（二）異物（如塵埃，睫毛，植物，花粉，石灰末，水門汀，人工肥料，烟草粉，胡椒等）（三）皮膚病藥（如焦性沒食子酸，勒索辛等），（四）點眼藥（如阿托品）（五）撒布藥（如甘汞），（六）蛔蟲液（所謂蛔蟲結膜炎）（九）劇烈的放射熱，（八）光綫的刺戟，（九）眼瞼的位置異常（如眼臉外翻症，眼瞼內翻症，及兎眼症），（十）不潔的空氣，以及（十一）室內的空氣與光綫不足（易使眼睛疲勞）等等。傳染可分直接接觸傳染及間接接觸傳染，牠的傳染病菌。則有可赫威克司氏菌，肺炎菌，重程菌，葡萄狀菌，連鎖狀菌，流行性感胃菌，大腸菌，枯草梁菌，洽病菌及實扶的里菌等等。這等病菌，均可由顯微鏡的檢查而區別。　　急性結膜突發生的時候。眼臉結膜（眼皮內面），大都著明充血腫脹。重症的時候。眼球結膜（眼白）亦來充血浮腫。眼瞼潮紅腫脹。有時且來下垂。所以患者常訴眼睛縮小。眼瞼的邊緣。每因流淚而糜爛。分泌物除含多量的淚液外。常混粘液的絮狀物。重症的時候。則分泌物增加而呈化膿狀。若將分泌物試行顯微鏡檢查。屢可證明一定的病菌。本病常爲流行性。往往可以傳染一家。這是我們應當所注意的。　　本病患者眼睛多感灼熱，癢痛，羞明，及異物感覺。分泌物每每附着角膜面上（眼黑）。所以視力屢被障礙。若觀燈火。則其周圍。常見虹霓。通常各種症候。夜間較劇，晨起時，眼瞼緣多由分泌物粘着乾燥。以致開眼常患困難。本病多侵兩眼，或者前後相繼而發。　　本病的經過。大約持續七日至十四日。若經滴當的治療。當可漸次治愈。有時轉爲慢性結膜炎。　　本病的治療法。除由專科醫師施行一般結膜炎的療法外。應更檢查牠的病菌。因爲往往尚需特殊的治療。否則不克奏效。同時病人自己應當嚴守下列各條。就楚（一）避免塵埃？烟，不潔空氣。（二）日光下及燈光下。不可閱書工作。以節眼睛的疲勞。（三）分泌物旣有傅染性。所以病人的毛巾手巾。不可與人共用。並須另外單獨洗滌。（四）或戴着色眼鏡。以避强光的刺戟。（五）整理便通。以冀减少眼部的充血。肺結核淺說（六七）  胡嘉言　　第十二章　肺結核之治療　　為什麽肺結核症沒有特效藥呢？我們要曉得，特效藥唯一的目的，就是殺滅本症的病原菌；這在肺結核症一方面，當然是非結核程菌莫屬了！他的殺滅方法，在第一章裏面係曾經提過的；但儘敢滅菌的方法是應有盡有，對於人體則有損無利的，並且他的外面，係有脂狀或蠟狀物質被覆的，抵抗力又特殊强固；如果我們用尋常的殺菌劑以入於人體，結果結核菌，倒還沒有受着重大影響，而人體已先遭殃，支持爲難了！如果用較輕的成份，俾人體不過分受損，則結核菌更加視若等閒，無關痛癢了！這是一個很重要的原因！所以肺結核症之無特效藥，並不是根本沒有殺菌劑；祇是此種殺菌劑不便應用於人體罷了！此外，結核菌裏面係有一種內在的毒素Endct　Xine的；如果這結核菌死滅了，他的內在毒素當然會輸入人體的？這也是損害很大的！所以名符其實的肺結核症特效藥，一定要有下列的附附的條件方可；卽：一，殺滅結核菌，二，人體不致損壞，三，中和內在毒素是。這在現代的治療方面，還沒可能勝任愉快的：那末，所謂特效藥也有，也只好虛位以待將來了！　　現在可以回到正文來談肺結核之治療了！　的包括範圍也；很廣闊的；可分爲：一，天然治療；二，攝生與營　，三，心理的關係；四，光　治療；五，非專門性的刺激治療；六，專門性的刺激治療；七，藥的的對症療法；八，其他；手　的治療。這都是各有各的特殊情形及價値的；現　幾一一分述於下面：</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言定期舉行减租總動員  吹　　本市减租委員會，以减租運動，遷延多時，尚無具體辦法，茲該會定於本月二十一日起，至月底止，舉行總動員，茲事頗値得旅滬一般人的注意。　　衣，食，住，行，爲人生生活上四大要素，而四大要素中，衣，食，行。三者，可省則省，尚有辦法，惟住的問題，眞是無法可想，若住居高大洋房的資產階級不計外，其餘旅居滬上的一般職業平民，沒有一個對於住的問題不發生困難，天天叫苦。　　我來約略算算這篇賬罷，住一間亭子間，亦須得七八元，或十許元，若住一間統樓，則非十餘元，或二十餘元不辦，如是則每月收入五六十元之薪金，僅住的一項，已須化去其半矣。假定人多經濟稍微寬裕，獨住一宅，房租非五六十元，或七八十元不辦，此外再加房捐電燈自來水等費，每月已非百元不辦，如是收入二百元之薪金，而住的問題，已化去十之五矣。　　至若商店，若在商業繁盛之區，每幢每月房租，從一百餘兩起，至三百餘兩止，此外一切開支，尚不在內，則每日所費，已非數十元不辦，假定商品有二三分錢的厚利，每日亦須做三四百元，方能勉强開支，尚無盈餘之可言。　　總以上所云，無論旅居於滬上的職業平民，或設肆於上海之商家，其辛勤而計劃所得到的利益，都半爲房東地主所吸收，况當此農村破產，各業多在此不景氣的潮流中，怎樣再受得起房東地主的榨取和剝削，而欲求其市面之繁榮，眞是緣木而求魚了，所以减低房租，確是復典市面的惟一要務。　　或者謂房租之增高，實由於地價之昂貴，若房租减低，則房東地主，不免受偌大的損失，要之地價之所以繼漲增高，一方由於資本家和地皮掮客之乘機射利，而一方則租界當局房捐價値，亦可因此提高，而决不顧到一般市民的痛苦和難堪，現在房東地主受些損失，和租界當局减少一些收入，亦屬很應該的事。　　我再反轉來說，假定不减房租，照此情形下去，勢必有店無人開，有屋無人住，就看現在情形而論，高大洋房店面，無人過問的，巳到處皆是，若再相持下去，上海市面，更將不堪設想，若到此地步，恐房東地主的損失更重，而租界當局將從何處去收捐呢，故房東地主，倘然及早覺悟，情願减輕房租，目前似乎受到一些損失，或减少一些利潤，其實塞翁失馬，安知非福，亡羊補牢，尚未爲晚。絡緯  耳禾　　假設夏天的詩人是蟬子，那麼秋天的詩人無疑地是絡緯了。提起絡緯我是如何地高興，童時，我和牠確是極親密的朋友呢。爲了長年的生活在都市裏，和這秋天的詩人，和這親密的朋友疏遠得太厲害了。但卽使在都市裏，每當秋晚走上露臺看淡黃的月亮時我如何不憶起牠—秋天的詩人，童時極親密的朋友。。　　今夏返里，本想立刻出來的，但爲了種種關係，我直到看過了家鄕的慘淡的中秋月纔像一隻辛苦的旅雁那樣伶仃地重來滬上，但使我滿足的在家鄉，我巳聽過了童時所熟爛的絡緯的歌唱了。我欣喜，但在另一方面我幾乎被濃重的感傷所壓倒。這秋天的詩人，這童時極親密的朋友如今和我隔閡了，我和牠已不能重溫那美麗的古老的舊夢…　　絡緯，這文雅而又漂亮的名字在童特是和我陌生的。我只知道牠的名字叫「作紗童子，」多好，這帶有鄕土味的質樸的名字！在豆棚瓜架中，在爽人的秋晚的微風夢樣的飄拂時，正是這天才詩人顯露鋒芒的時侯。牠翹着漂亮的芒子，振着綠色的薄薄的翅子，這聲音，像驟雨那樣的奔騰，又像秋雨那樣的浙瀝。　　秋天的晚上穿着薄薄的衣衫，捏手揑脚的偷進了母親的房裏，找着元霄點賸下來的紅燭，輕輕的跨過了籬笆門，撥開了阻擋道路的各色各樣的植物，在凉露零零的手掌那麽大的葉子上便有絡緯在放聲歌唱。把紅燭點上了，一片幽光散射到綠葉了上去，但只要靜靜兒，絡緯的歌唱並不因燭光而停止，牠只把聲音壓低了一點，慢後又漸漸兒高唱起來了。看着芒子，看着綠色的翅子的振動，無論如何不敢驚擾這位秋天的詩人</p>

<p>。但假若在這時去捉牠，那是最容易不過的，因爲牠歌唱得太出神了，牠幾乎像一個熱情衝動時的詩人那樣把什麽都忘掉了，當然，這時來一個意外的襲擊，牠是無法防備的。捉到後關在籠子裏，每天把絲瓜花那樣的東西給牠吃，便可以活下去。但究是詩人，一隻籠子只能關住牠的身子不能關住牠的熱情，掛在牀架上，這詩人，又忘形地高唱起來了。　　正是夜深時，正是做夢做得最濃時，這過着夜生活的詩人常常歌唱得使人驚醒，假若此時正有一窗殘月，那就索性起牀，在空庭中去看藍天裏的小星點，吟吟黃仲則的「如此星辰非昨夜，爲誰風露立中宵」的纏綿徘惻的詩句，那是十分够味的事情。假若愁思襲來，詩興勃發，那就可以回到桌子旁抽一張紙，提一支筆寫他三篇四篇抒情的動人的七絕或五古，那又是十分够味的事情。　　離鄉前三天，正是小病剛好，我孤坐在窗下一邊看着秋晚的明朗朗的月亮，一邊輕輕的哼着文選詩，不經意地從窗外飄來被風撕碎了的絡緯歌唱的聲音，如絲樣的斷續，夢樣的飄忽，我掩卷沉思，我想，這回離開了絡緯歌唱的聲音，不知何時何刻纔能重溫？我感傷我幾乎流下孤寂的眼淚。如今隻身來滬，眞的遠離絡緯的歌唱了，但在電燈光下，回憶在胸際打轉時，我如何不苦憶着牠—這秋天的詩人童時的極親密的朋友。古城之夜  胡慰雄　　掌櫃的掌着燭台向前引導，我們十多個人都像探險似的躡着脚尖跟在後面，不敢哼一口大氣。外面的是奔馬一般的雨聲，走過這悠長而昏默的走廊的時候，一陣風迎面送來，燭光搖忽不定，火是幾乎像慘綠的燐火，掌櫃的雖然用殷勤的口吻招呼我們，他一邊側轉了身子，讓那弱小的燭光可以照到最後一個客人，但是每個人都緊張着，彷彿馬上有危險的事故要發生似的。一面提防着脚下的水潭，一面又要讓過從屋頂上吊下來的龐大的蜘蛛。如果我們在黑暗中摸索前進，或許要疑惑我們走進什麽「鬼牆」之內了。　　在廊的盡端，是一排五間的平房，就是這招商客寓內最上等的房間了。掌櫃的如他的籍貫一樣，謙和地站在走廊前，用自己寬大的身子擋住了從院子里吹來的風，於是又開起話盆子來：這是小店上好的房間了，客官們請，請！從前是江西的窰客人包了的，他們一年到有半年多住在這里的，說小店的房間好，就是他們做好了賣買，也想多住幾天走，咱們同自己人一個樣兒，客官們多住幾天就知道不是俺扯謊，嘻嘻……　　我們坐了驚天的船，又是在狂風暴雨之中驚心駭胆，再從碼頭走了那末長的泥漿路，到客寓已經是筋疲力盡了。雖然從前進的店面由長廊走到後面來的時侯，由於這里特有霉腐，灰黯，彷佛一所枯廟似的，疑惑住進了黑道兒，　是各人在房間里找到了舖位，一切的顧慮，懷疑，早不由自主被睡魔所驅除了。掌櫃的却始終忙得什麽似的，他在五間屋里穿出穿進。爲我們點上了燭台，又獨自演說起來：　　舖位還好？客官？這是小店上好的房間了。哼，不是俺自家打腫臉袋充胖子，這城里就再沒有更好的房間了……聽着他那樣嚕囌，却沒有人同他搭話，各人整理着床舖，有的已是打起鼻鼾來了。掌櫃的自己笑了幾聲，搭訕着說：「兩下得眞大哩。客官們，安睡罷，咱們明天見。」說着那患失眠症的小伙計纔提了水茶進來，掌櫃的像被針刺了一下似的跳起來，用手掌拍着他的禿頂：混蛋，混蛋，只顧講話，客官的茶水都忘了！一邊指着小伙計：小痴，這幹嗎啊，鍋子里沒有水了嗎？　　掌櫃的嗓子提得太高了，一個賣鮮的山東漢子從床上坐起來，「掌櫃的，咱們要睡覺，講不完的那些鳥話，滾你媽的！」掌櫃的纔覺得沒趣似的一疊連聲「是：是：」退了出去。　　我本來討厭着掌櫃的那種顚來倒去的自私宣傳，不過我沒有賣解的山東漢子那樣率直，掌櫃的無非想巴結一點，做生意總以謙和爲上，他那樣堆着笑臉，雖然想馬上躺到床上去睡覺，倒底說不出「滾你媽的！」那樣不顧面子的話。　　但是睡到床上聽着風聲雨聲像獅吼那樣地在屋頂滾來滾去，身體雖然已經不能彈動，但是一點沒有睡意，反希望掌櫃的那個胖胖的臉突然推門進來，再嘮叨地談談小店的什麼，讓那些在我腦海中盤旋的思潮驅逐開去；或許他更會凑趣的講述這古城的歷史或是什麽新聞之欵，來換過這長長的雨夜，然而四面鼻鼾響着的時候，我只有靜靜地躺着被多少慘痛的回憶咬着我的心。勞生什記  西蒙　　時序一轉入秋凉，人的情感好像亦因此輕鬆了些，閒散了些，爲了這眼前有使你覺得麻酥似的爽朗的風，溫暖的陽光，想着剛夕馳過去的夏日迫逼的氣燄，實在是應當舒一口氣的，然而輕鬆里，閒散里，却又載着一份不能說的淡漠的愁，這愁，除分負着一些實際上生活需要的憂慮，所有賸下來的，則似乎皆爲驚嘆時日是飛奔得這樣快，一年又走近末梢了。　　我眞願望在這金風微拂，不　不熱的時候，會有給我一個靜適的　　，讓我好好地休息一回，我尤神往於這時候住屋週遭紛陳　　種明媚的麗景：看晨曦流　來出給遠　的園林鈎着金色的邊沿，傍晚又看沐在薄薄的夕陽光裏佈滿着淸雅的黃昏的街，站在露台外邊，欣賞路人往來的姿態，搖在風中的街樹的姿態，花費個把鐘頭依然是貧婪地不欲走開的。除非等到送着夕陽沉下西天，新月御着晚裝盈盈地昇起來。　　可是是份心願現在竟未能做到，幾個月來無謂的勞碌，往往是一淸早便溜出去，直到深夜才回歸，幾個月了，每天都是這樣。使我愈加關心着住屋外一些明媚的麗景，雖然儘是在外邊，若一逢容許我遐思我使馬上閉上眼睛，懷懷念起住屋外早上給晨曦鑲着邊沿的遠處的圍林，也許如今已漆上一層蕭殺的氣息；和懷念着夕陽下黃昏的街，街中各樣景物的姿態會不會有小小的變動，有的少下去，有的多上來。我感到自己是怎樣地可憐，爲什麽要那麽天天糾擾着呢？不是己然有了一個靜適的境地等侯我去享受麽？我曾經打算索性扔棄一切，關在屋子裏，儘情地鑑賞它們一下，但是我能够這樣做麼，不我淸楚假如有一天懶散不作事。就將有一天生活斷了綫，連接不了。於是我希望自己生病，病着終可以躺一躺，在屋子裏留連幾天了。然而我彷彿並不容易會生病，一匹輾轉於生活鞭笞下的駱駝呵！我不得不嘆息起來。　　於是，我只得在深夜的回家道上，對月亮加以讚賞了。深夜：有着落葉飄墮的聲音，跟着風，凄婉地嗚嗚着，在此時，月亮的光則明潔到有點冷冰的感覺，我踩着月色，拖着影子，心時時作着顫枓，什麼情感沒有彷彿忘掉了世間，也被世間忘掉。是的那麽長長的一條寬敞的街，只有我自個兒帶着零落的脚步在走着。是不免發生着海一樣深的孤單之威的。雖然天上有月亮伴着我，儘可不必掛念黑暗中隱伏着意外的襲擊，可是忽然來了一堆雲，月亮叫掩住了，而且過了十五，月亦不能老是給我照着光亮的路，有時明，有時暗，我終於在暗兒裏摸索了。播音節目彈詞　　周劍虹玉夔龍。　　東方（一〇二〇）上午十一時一刻至零時　　開篇「蘇東坡」　　文章韓柳與歐蘇。絕代才華今古無。傳說老泉年少日。功名無意久荒疏。二十七齡始發憤。勤心埋首用功夫。弟兄父子皆名士。同步靑雲占甲科。一門忠孝人間少。兩子風流世上無。長堤十里築西湖。曾敎琴操參禪語。勘破紅塵作道姑。拜從佛印老頭陀。朝雲侍妾常相侍。檀板金樽自按歌。月白風淸游赤壁。匹川道上共歡呼。夢祝烏龜丞相壽。醒時詩句起風波。生平緣在東甫地。寄跡毘陵十載多。虛懷最愛琅玕竹。對竹在吟信筆塗。至今人慶東坡壽。仍掛靑松白鶴圖。遺風傳播滿京都。居閒不識憂愁事。降調升遷不在乎。時常捧腹笑葫蘆。人間不愧坡仙譽。光我頭顱醉裏過。尚傳古跡在姑蘇。　　邢瑞亭釵頭鳳　　惠靈（一三八〇）下午九時至十時　　開篇「紅樓夢平兒理妝」　　秋高氣爽淡淡風。大觀園點綴奪天工。姊妹花枝多有興。吟詩作賦樂無窮。這一天風姐生辰日。花廳慶壽喜融融。誰知醋海風波起。璉二奶奶大發雷霆怒氣冲。無故痛打嬌婢子。佾平兒滿懷委屆恨萬重。幸有衆人來分解。寶二　相勸到怡紅。題起傷心兩淚溶。襲人寶玉　　慰。說道姐姐呀二奶奶素來量寬洪。一　　會將你責。怪只怪璉二爺作事理欠通，勸姐姐快去重梳洗。莫把此事掛在胸。平姑娘聽說抬身</p>

<h3>The Sixian River's Water Level Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>The North Bank at the Border of Donghai and Guanyun Breached for Forty Zhang. The Flood Prevention Office Dispatches Personnel to Various Counties for Rescue. The Water Level at Zhongyun and Yaowan Continues to Rise for Days. The North Gate of Zaoyang River is Flooded, and Residents are Evacuated.</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Hai News: The water level of the Sixian River continues to rise sharply, and the surge is extremely fierce. The north bank at the border of Donghai and Guanyun breached for forty zhang yesterday, and the flood was overflowing. Magistrate He Zhengkang of Donghai County gathered thousands of civilians to block the breach overnight, barely preventing a major collapse. Breaches also occurred in two locations, Qianwei and Zhangzhuang, in Shuyang. The entire Boys Scout troop of Tanggou Elementary School was dispatched to participate in the work of closing the breaches. The exhaustion of the people is evident. Another report: The Chaomi River is rising incessantly. The counties of Donghai and Guanyun are mobilizing large numbers of civilians to jointly build a new embankment to prevent breaches. It is found that the Chaomi Rivers are all suffering from backflow from the Sixian River, resulting in overflowing banks and causing disasters. (Special Dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) The Sixian Flood Prevention Office dispatched engineers Guan Cheng, Jiang Xingxiao, Yuan Chengyi, Xue Yiying, Wang Jizhi, and Shen Bingyi on the 21st to rescue in Sixian, Suyu, Lian, Shuyang, Donghai, and Guanyun. According to news from Lian, the Gray Mound New Embankment in that county is currently stable. Residents clashed with those from Shuyang during rescue efforts. News from Suqian: The north gate of the Zaoyang River is currently flooded, and residents are being evacuated. (Special Dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Huaiyin) News from Yaowan: The embankment foot at the south gate of the town has been seeping water in recent days, causing anxiety among the people. The embankment wall at the gate breached on the morning of the 20th. Magistrate Zhang of Suqian has telegraphed the provincial government and river affairs authorities separately to report the situation. (Special Dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) The Baojia River mouth of the Sixian River within the Huaiyin territory has been suffering from backflow for a long time, threatening to cause disaster to Huai and Si. The county government has now blocked it, requiring an estimated 3,500 cubic meters of soil, 400 dan of sorghum stalks, and 200 wooden stakes. (Special Dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) Today, the water level rose by one centimeter, reaching 36.907 meters, which is considered a rise of one inch, totaling 267 inches. The level in Suqian is still at 209 inches, and in Qingjiang, it rose by three inches, reaching 250 inches. However, the gangplanks of the boat bridges at the north and south gates of the water gate have been moved ashore. (Special Dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) The water control authorities here see that various places in Hai and Shu are adding attacks, and do not understand the true picture of diverting the Yellow River's water. It is heard that they are planning to respond to all parties, mainly with the following points: (1) The Sixian River has just been dredged and can conveniently connect to the sea, making it more convenient compared to the roundabout route of the Inner Canal to the sea. (2) The Sixian River has a large flood discharge capacity and is located at a lower elevation from the sea. (3) The current water level is still far from the remote embankment of the Sixian River and has not reached the most dangerous level. (4) The water flow below the Liu Lao Jian in the Central Canal is 540 cubic meters per second, while the Sixian River is 800 cubic meters per second, with a limited difference between them. (Special Dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) Xu Dingkang and Xu Xinwu, the flood prevention directors of the Canal Area and the Sixian River Area, and Wang Depu, the commissioner of the Huaiyin Area, telegraphed the provincial government today to appeal for disaster relief for the ice-stricken areas in northern Jiangsu. (Special Dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) The water level in the Zhongyun Yaosu area continues to rise by three to four inches daily. A section of the Su Village dividing embankment of the Yun embankment in Suqian and Huangdun Lake collapsed again, and the water rushed southward, directly into Huangdun Lake. The town of Zaoyang is in a critical situation, and the villagers in the riverside areas under the Fifth District's jurisdiction have fled. (Central News Agency Dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) According to reports from Tongshan, Fengxian, and Pei Counties on the 22nd, the water levels have all dropped by three to four public inches. Chen Guofu commended Commissioner Shao for his efforts in building dikes to prevent the Yellow River and sent a special telegram to express his appreciation. (Central News Agency Dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Sixian River is being squeezed by the Yellow River flow, and the water level is level with the top of the dikes. The entire dike is in a state of extreme danger. Two locations, Qianwei and Zhangzhuang, near Yangkou in Shuyang County, breached successively on the morning of the 21st. Fortunately, the officials and people of Yang had previously built a new dike outside the original dike to block the water, preventing the disaster area from expanding. The Sixian, Chaomi, Guanyun, and Rose Rivers are all filled with Yellow River water, and the situation is serious. (Central News Agency Dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Wang Kemin Arrives in Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Waiting to Meet with President Wang to Report on Everything. Will Go to Moganshan to Meet with Huang Fu in a Few Days.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Kemin concluded the affairs of the Political Affairs Committee and arrived in Pukou at 8:00 AM on the 22nd. Xu Xiuzhi and others welcomed him at the station.

According to Wang, with the conclusion of the Political Affairs Committee, important archives have been completely transported to Beijing, and secondary ones have been temporarily stored in Beiping with a separate management committee established. All office staff have been dismissed. The task here is to report to President Wang on the closing situation, and in a day or two, he will go to Moganshan to report to Chairman Huang Fu. The North China Economic Association was organized with the consent of the authorities in advance. It is composed of people from the financial and economic circles of North China and is purely a group for developing the economy of North China. Neither the official nor the Japanese side participated. Whether or not the association entrusts me with the position of director is not a problem. As for the issue of economic cooperation between China and Japan, it is only in the air and has not been seen in reality. (Special Dispatch from the 22nd)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Reflections on Hearing of the Recompilation of Elementary School Textbooks in North China</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>A recent dispatch from this newspaper stated that the Tianjin Municipal Government has decided to recompile elementary school textbooks to suit the environment of elementary schools in North China and Tianjin. This news was appropriately disclosed in the newspaper on the day of "September 18th". Upon seeing this, I feel deeply sorrowful. After scratching my head and feeling my chest, I cannot help but pick up my pen and offer a word.</p>
<p>Compiling textbooks specifically for a certain region is what is known as local teaching materials. There are already many precedents in the elementary school education field. Generally, the history section narrates local worthies and historical sites, and the geography section records mountains, rivers, customs, and practices. Those less common animals and plants are rarely mentioned in ordinary textbooks, but they are related to the people's livelihood in the local area, so special textbooks are written to record them in detail, which belongs to natural science. Furthermore, there are booksellers who are unwilling to give up business outside the country's borders, but the national conditions are different, and ordinary textbooks are difficult to adapt to. Therefore, a special kind of textbook is compiled to meet the needs. For example, in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia, booksellers all have specially compiled textbooks. Generally, the national flag or the portrait of the head of state of the country to which the land belongs is printed at the beginning of the volume, and the meaning and wording do not violate the views of those countries. This is another type of local teaching material. For booksellers, business is the biggest premise, so they have their reasons for doing this. However, from the standpoint of education, using such teaching materials to educate overseas compatriots of the home country will have the effect of making overseas compatriots forget their motherland and willingly be obedient citizens. It would not be an exaggeration to denounce them as traitors. It goes without saying that such books cannot be mentioned in the same breath as the first type of local teaching materials.</p>
<p>Now, will the intention of the recompilation of elementary school textbooks in North China be similar to the latter type of local teaching materials? We know that it must not be, based on the self-awareness and sense of responsibility of the Chinese people. In that case, will it have the same purpose as the former type of local teaching materials? This is the duty of the experimental elementary school or the education research association, and there is no need to wait for the special action of the administrative organs. Looking at the words "suitable for the environment" in the dispatch, we know that it is completely different from the compilation of the two types of local teaching materials mentioned earlier. The environment limits it, and without change, it cannot adapt. Adapting by making changes means setting the final limits, abandoning everything outside the limits, and never relaxing within the limits. Then the hard work of recompiling elementary school textbooks will be deeply understood by the people of the country. Who can bear to add harsh accusations?</p>
<p>The use of textbooks lies in imparting real experience, with the aim of implementing educational principles. As for being emotional, shouting and cursing, that is the constant state of inferior propaganda texts. Although the currently circulating textbooks are not yet perfect, they may not have this mistake. However, the so-called environment does not allow it. It is acceptable to recompile them to adapt. It is absolutely unacceptable to obliterate real experience and replace it with irrelevant materials. This is the final limit. All real experiences that belong to our race and are necessary for elementary school students to receive should still be incorporated into the textbooks without any discount. There is no harm in being extremely calm when writing, but the description should not be distorted in the slightest, so that those who read it can have the same nourishment as elementary school students across the country, and will not fall into spiritual weakness. Furthermore, textbooks are tools. Tools should be perfected, but how to use the tools to achieve the stated goal is more important than the tools themselves. Now, the elementary school teachers in North China, in their teaching, will probably also change their old ways and adapt to the environment. If they gradually become decadent as a result, and what they say and do deviates from the educational principles, then even if there are excellent textbooks, how can they be successful? Or, if on the contrary, the elementary school teachers all recognize that their own task is particularly difficult, study carefully, work hard, and understand it spiritually, then even if the textbooks are slightly imperfect, what is there to worry about not achieving great success in education?</p>
<p>On April 26th of the 18th year of the Republic of China, the National Government issued a general order announcing the educational purpose: "The education of the Republic of China is based on the Three People's Principles, with the aim of enriching the people's lives, supporting the survival and development of the society, developing the national economy, and continuing the life of the nation, striving for national independence, universal civil rights, and development of people's livelihood, in order to promote world harmony." The words are beautiful and commendable. We hope that everyone within the country who is related to education, whether compiling textbooks or engaging in teaching, will remember this beautiful educational purpose and devote their efforts to implementing it, so that it will not become merely a historical material of education.</p>

<h3>England-South Africa Air Flight</h3>
<p>Black Arrives in Cairo from London, Plans to Break Amy Johnson's Record</p>
<p>(London) Black, who won the prize in the England-Australia air race with Scott last year, departed from Hatfield Aerodrome at 4:11 PM today, planning to break the flight record from England to Cape Town, South Africa and back. His plane is named "Poomran," with a maximum speed of 235 miles per hour, carrying 250 gallons of fuel, and with his assistant, Ma Arsae, serving as a wireless operator. This trip plans to land in Cairo, Kisumu, and Cape Town, directly across the Alps. Black hopes to arrive in Cairo by tomorrow morning. Black has already made this attempt, flying from London to Cairo in 12 hours and 15 minutes, but was forced to return to Croydon Aerodrome due to engine failure. The current flight record from England to Cape Town was set by Mrs. Morrison, formerly Amy Johnson, in 1932, with a flight of 4 days, 6 hours, and 54 minutes for the outbound journey, and 7 days, 7 hours, and 5 minutes for the return journey. This is the beginning of Black's four major planned flights. If successful, he will fly from England to Hong Kong and then fly back.

<h3>Songhua River Fleet Plans to Invade Russian Territorial Waters; Soviet Union Repeatedly Warns</h3>
<p>(Moscow) A message from Bolik reports that the Japanese and "Manchukuo" authorities plan to have the Songhua River Fleet invade Soviet territorial waters near Bolik through the Kazakevicha Strait at the end of September. According to reliable sources, this point has caused a major dispute within the Japanese military. The moderate faction believes that the Soviet Union has repeatedly warned in a public manner and in formal documents that Japanese and "Manchukuo" ships will never be allowed to forcibly enter the area near Bolik and along the Kazakevicha Strait, so this move is extremely dangerous and points out that this move will have serious consequences. However, it is claimed that adventurers have been granted permission to proceed with this move. They hope that by delaying it, the Soviet authorities will be caught off guard. At the same time, they will be captured unintentionally. (22nd Havas)</p>
<p>(Changchun) Regarding the dispute between Japan, Manchukuo, and Russia, the Russian side proposed a joint border commission. The Kwantung Army is not very satisfied with this proposal. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent Xike to Manchukuo, and the Ministry of the Army also sent Major Tamura to Changchun. Major Tamura discussed countermeasures with the Kwantung Army, and Director Xike consulted with the embassy in Manchukuo and the Manchukuo authorities. The Kwantung Army insisted on resolving the demarcation of the border first and then organizing a border determination commission. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will decide on its attitude after Director Xike returns to Beijing to report. (22nd Hualian)</p>
<h3>Cabinet Crisis in Spain; President Looks for Candidate to Form Cabinet</h3>

In addition, representatives from Catalonia and Basque provinces also made demands to the president, saying that the local autonomy system must be respected. It is generally believed that President Zamora will soon decide on a candidate to form a cabinet. (21st Havas)</p>
<h3>Poland Plans to Build Highway</h3>
<p>Costing 120 Million Polish Currency to Commemorate the Late General Piłsudski</p>
<p>(Warsaw Correspondence) After the death of Polish national hero General Piłsudski, the Polish people commemorate his achievements. Memorial halls and bronze statues and other souvenirs have been established everywhere. In Krakow, the old capital of Poland where Piłsudski was buried, the people even transported soil to build many small mountains about a hundred feet high, called Piłsudski Mountains. The soil was transported and gathered by the authorities and the people themselves. The Polish President Mosicki and the Prime Minister and ministers of various ministries all went to transport soil in person. The people of Krakow transported the soil in groups of hundreds and thousands by pushing carts from afar. Men and women were constantly on the road. Their collective will was like a fortress, and now it has all been completed. Recently, the Polish Road Administration Bureau officially proposed, for the sake of permanent commemoration, to build a large highway between Krakow in the south and Vilnius in the north, and to name the road after General Piłsudski. Some sections of this highway were originally planned to be built as part of the Polish Ministry of Transport's six-year plan. The total construction cost of this road is estimated to be between 80 million and 120 million Polish currency. The road surface of this highway is six meters wide, and it is made of local green triple-mixed soil and granite, making it extremely strong. At the same time, there is a road made of small stones, with a width of three and a half meters, running parallel to the asphalt road, specially for horse-drawn carriages. It is also planned to plant trees on both sides of the road to decorate the scenery.</p>

<h3>European Cash Transported to the United States to Avoid War Panic</h3>
<p>(New York) Since September 9th, the cash scheduled to be transported to the United States has exceeded US$15 million. It is said that since the danger of the East African War has become the center of European diplomacy, there has been an atmosphere of panic in the economic centers of various countries. Observers believe that this cash is owned by the US government and is being returned to the United States for safety reasons, or it is owned by individuals who are transporting it to the United States to exchange for currency because of the uncertain situation in Europe.

<h3>Austria Feels Anxious</h3>
<p>(Vienna) Figures in political circles and various patriotic groups are very worried about the development of the international situation and deeply fear that the cooperation between Italy and Austria will be hindered as a result.

It is heard that the Austrian government is currently negotiating with the governments of Britain, France, and Italy, saying that the Danube River problem really needs to be resolved quickly and hopes that attention will be paid to this.

<h3>Italian-Ethiopian Dispute Fails to Be Resolved Peacefully; Will Affect the Situation in the Far East</h3>
<p>Britain and France Uphold the Principles of the League of Nations Covenant; Add Another Layer of Protection for Those Who Are Invaded; Support for Collective Security System Gradually Increases</p>
<p>(Geneva) People here believe today that if the Italian-Ethiopian dispute cannot be resolved peacefully and member states of the League of Nations implement sanctions against Italy, the Far East will be greatly affected. After the representatives of Britain and France exchange opinions, they may declare that the principles they hold are that the League of Nations Charter must be implemented as a whole worldwide, no matter where the act of aggression occurs. Now, the number of countries supporting the collective security plan is gradually increasing, so people generally feel that the problem of China's future may make the Italian-Ethiopian problem seem small. If the British and French governments actually make the above statement, then that statement may have a great effect on protecting China's peace and territorial integrity, and it may also prevent German extremists from sacrificing Austria, Memel, and Ukraine in order to seek territorial expansion.

<h3>No Official Reply Received, Britain Has No Immediate Comment, Cabinet to Meet Tomorrow to Discuss the Overall Situation</h3>
<p>(London) Although newspapers here are competing to publish the news of Italy's rejection of the Five-Power Committee's proposals in large print, official circles are quite cautious, stating that Britain must wait until the Five-Power Committee receives the full text of Italy's response before making any comment. It is also said that the League of Nations must also study the replies from both Italy and Abyssinia in detail before taking any action. (National News Agency telegram, 22nd)</p>

<p>(Rome) The Cabinet is scheduled to hold another meeting on Tuesday. King Victor Emmanuel III returned to the capital in the afternoon. The government originally planned to issue an order today to various Fascist Party organizations, totaling ten million members, to conduct a general mobilization exercise.

Semi-official sources have also stated that this exercise has no intention of aggression against others, nor any political meaning, and is merely intended to make all countries aware of the orderliness of Fascist Party discipline.

<p>(Rome) Last night's originally planned nationwide war preparedness exercise, in which tens of millions of Italians were to immediately gather at their designated locations upon the sounding of a signal to demonstrate to the world Italy's readiness for any eventuality, was suddenly postponed "to avoid anti-British actions, as police would find it difficult to prevent such actions under the current circumstances." However, members of various paramilitary groups had already gathered last night and dispersed peacefully afterwards, only marching to Mussolini's residence and shouting cheers. The exercise is now tentatively scheduled for next Tuesday, by which time the Cabinet will have met and Italy's policy should be determined. (National News Agency telegram, 22nd)</p>

<p>(Rome) Although Prime Minister Mussolini has rejected the Five-Power Committee's proposals, according to sources here, Italy is not launching an immediate war because Abyssinia's rainy season has not yet ended. Military attachés from other countries stationed in Italy are closely watching the development of all situations, and expect the attack to occur around October 11th. Today, another 5,000 soldiers, 1,000 workers, and a large amount of military supplies were loaded onto three ships and sent to Africa. (National News Agency telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>Milan: Italy's expedition to East Africa has already had an impact on the domestic economy.

<p>The U.S. representative of a foreign company based in San Pedro, California, is currently seeking to purchase millions of barrels of heavy oil, gasoline, and lubricant oil. Several oil companies, who do not wish to be named, have already received orders from the Italian government to ship tens of thousands of barrels of kerosene by-products to an African port (the name of the port is not specified) before December 31st of this year. In addition, the Italian government is negotiating with oil companies to purchase 10,000 to 14,000 tons of heavy oil for delivery in October or November. This heavy oil appears to be intended for refining aviation gasoline. Oil companies are hesitant to set oil prices for delivery next month, given the threat of war. (Havas telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Government Notifies Acceptance of Proposals</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is said that the biggest reason for the Five-Power Committee's temporary suspension of proceedings is that the Italian representative, Aloisi, has not yet received clear instructions from Rome and cannot convey the Italian government's views. The Abyssinian government's reply was also not received last night, so they had to wait until Monday to reconvene. However, after the meeting adjourned, notification was received from Abyssinia that it accepts the committee's proposals in principle. (National News Agency telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Military Morale Frustrated, Eager to Fight a Death Match with Italy, King Warns Subordinates Not to Act Rashly, Security Tightened Along the Railway Line</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: Although Abyssinian authority is well-established, the current military morale is frustrated and eager to fight, which is a danger that it may not be able to contain. Reuters dispatches from the Eritrean and Walwal border areas both say that young chieftains full of vigor are increasingly unwilling to wait quietly for the enemy to attack and are eager to try. This is true in both the north and the south. The recent news of Italy's rejection of the Five-Power Committee's proposals has made these people even more impatient. The commander of the northern border, in anticipation of this situation, has withdrawn the frontier outposts by 20 miles and does not allow scouts to cross the outposts. The Abyssinian King has reiterated his warnings, instructing all commanders not to take offensive actions and to retreat even if the Italian army attacks, pending the League of Nations' final policy. Abyssinians are known as one of the world's slowest-moving peoples, but the recent developments in the Italy-Abyssinia crisis have gradually changed Abyssinian behavior. Official circles are very active, and the people are also grateful and stimulated. (Reuters telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: The Abyssinian Emperor held a long talk with the British Minister to Abyssinia, Barton, today. The conversation focused on the protection of foreigners.

<p>After Rejection of the League of Nations Proposals, Newspaper Commentary from Various Countries, British and French Newspapers Say Peace is Not Hopeless, Hope the Italian Government Will Submit Counterproposals</p>
<p>(London) Comments in Paris and London newspapers on the Italian Cabinet's rejection of the Five-Power Committee's proposals generally say that a glimmer of hope remains. The Sunday Times said that calm and resolute decisions should be made now and that Britain's attitude is clear and unambiguous. The second step should be for the League of Nations to fulfill its responsibilities as a collective guardian of conscience, civilization, and security. There is no other dispute between Britain and Italy, so talk of war against Italy is meaningless. Le Matin and other newspapers all hope that Italy will submit counterproposals. Le Matin said that a decision on whether to end negotiations can only be made after these proposals are submitted. However, responsible parties in Rome say that negotiations have not broken down and that the great powers or the League of Nations should now put forward new proposals that are more in line with Italy's aspirations. (Reuters telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the League of Nations Council's small committee proposed a plan for resolving the Italy-Abyssinia dispute, which was rejected yesterday by the Italian Cabinet, the general tone of the newspapers here is that the Cabinet's communique was worded moderately, indicating that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini did not reject the League of Nations' continued mediation efforts. The newspapers also believe that the League of Nations has acknowledged that the current situation in Abyssinia cannot be delayed, otherwise it will endanger the security of Abyssinia's neighboring countries. However, while the League of Nations is well aware of the root cause of Abyssinia's problems, it is very difficult to agree with Italy on how to prescribe the remedy. Some observers believe that since the small committee's first proposal, which was rejected by the Italian Cabinet, has not been publicly released, it will not be difficult for Geneva to redraft a new proposal. Several newspapers also believe that after rejecting the small committee's proposal, the Italian government will submit its own counterproposals. (Havas telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>Italian Public Opinion Supports Government's Attitude, The Bridge Has Not Been Cut Off, That Is the Truth</p>
<p>(Rome) Newspapers commenting on the Cabinet's communique generally say that the government's current slogan is calm and moderation. The Tribune states, "The Cabinet's decision was caused by the sincere mediation of various countries. Although the language used in the communique is very firm, it does not reject the Geneva small committee's mediation attempts, so there is no need to panic." The Italian Daily believes that the committee's proposal tacitly acknowledges that foreigners residing in Abyssinia lack security and have no economic activity. As for the international police advocated by this proposal, they are not sufficient to deal with Abyssinian armed civilians, so Italy's security cannot be maintained. (Havas telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italian newspapers continue to comment on the League of Nations Council's small committee's proposal on the Italy-Abyssinia dispute. The tone remains moderate. The Envoy's correspondent in Geneva claims, "The bridge has not been cut off, that is the truth, and it is possible to seek a basis for negotiations of a completely different nature. Although Italy still adheres to its original policy, it has not resolutely closed the door to negotiations." (Havas telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>German Newspapers Acknowledge the Situation Has Reached a Serious Stage, The Mediterranean Powder Keg Could Explode at Any Moment</p>
<p>(Berlin) After Italian Prime Minister Mussolini rejected the League of Nations Council's small committee's proposal, newspapers here believe that a serious situation has developed. This case involves Italy's national prestige, and Mussolini has no possibility of compromise. The Local Guidance Newspaper also said, "A spark can start a prairie fire, and the powder keg in the Mediterranean may explode as a result." (Havas telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>Belgium Worried About Impact on Collective Security, Hopes the League of Nations Will Take a Firm Stance</p>
<p>Brussels: After news of Italy's rejection of the committee's proposal reached here, official circles are quite worried, fearing that the Italy-Abyssinia dispute could seriously undermine the collective security system, as Belgium considers the collective security system the most important guarantee of peace for small countries. The Socialist Party's organ, "People's News," believes that the only hope for maintaining peace is for Britain and the League of Nations to take a clear and firm stance. (Havas telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>British Labour Party Leader's Speech, Opposes Sanctions Against Italy</p>
<p>(London) Lansbury, the leader of the opposition Labour Party in the House of Commons, gave a speech in Cardiff today, reiterating his opposition to sanctions that could lead to war. He said, "The collective security system is originally endorsed, but if countries manufacture the most poisonous gases, the fastest airplanes, the most terrifying cannons and submarines to engage in war in order to implement this system, then I dare not hear of it. Since you have allowed me to express my personal opinion, I will work hard to carry out propaganda to seek the implementation of my way. If you have this belief, you should also come out and speak out in support of me. I now loudly call out to the people, if you want to stop the war, you must reduce the causes of war, and military sanctions are one of the causes of war, so you should reduce it. If the current situation in the world remains unchanged, then the socialism we advocate and the work we do will eventually perish with culture." (Havas telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain gave a speech in Kelso, Scotland, yesterday afternoon, mentioning the Italy-Abyssinia dispute, saying, "We are now focusing all our attention on the overseas situation, and the people of the whole country are practically backing the government's policy. This phenomenon is rarely seen. The current issue is by no means limited to Italy and Abyssinia. Its scope is extremely broad, and its meaning is also more profound, because it is related to the future of the peace organization, the League of Nations." Chamberlain then mentioned the criticism of Britain in Italian newspapers, saying, "I dare say that the criticism of our country in Italian newspapers is in full swing, but we can be gratified that our country has not suffered significant damage. Under the current circumstances, we must maintain calm so that after the intense emotions of the Italian people have subsided, they can treat their old British friends fairly and cooperate with us to maintain peace in Europe."

First, the committee member who drafted the articles of association reported on the drafting process of the articles of association and then submitted it for discussion. It was passed on the spot. Then, in accordance with the articles of association, nine committee members were elected to form the committee. As a result of mutual election, Zhou Zuomin, Zou Quansun, Zhu Shen, Fan Rui, Weng Wenhao, Zhong Bingfeng, Ji Hua, Wu Dingchang, He Lian and others were elected. At the same time, it was decided that the committee would be established on the same day, and a plenary meeting of the committee would be held within days to elect three standing committee members in accordance with the articles of association to take overall charge of the association affairs. The meeting adjourned at 3:30 pm. After the meeting, Zhou Zuomin hosted a tea party for the press at the Banking Association. More than a dozen people attended. Zhou elaborated on the purpose of the establishment of the Hebei Economic Association in detail. According to the talk, "The Hebei Economic Association has been jointly initiated and prepared by colleagues from the standpoint of serving social undertakings. It has only recently been completed and the establishment meeting was held at 3:00 pm this afternoon, passing the articles of association. The purpose of the establishment of this association is to investigate, study and assist the development of economic undertakings in Hebei. The working guidelines are detailed in the articles of association. Colleagues usually serve in the economic circles of Hebei. They are well aware of the rich products of Hebei, while at the same time the rural society is still extremely declining. In terms of relief, it is not effective unless the development of agriculture, industry and mining is promoted. Promoting development depends on the acquisition of economic power. The first is to regenerate on its own, to build its foundation with its own strength, and then to meet international demand. However, economic relations are extremely complicated, and agriculture and industry all have their interrelationships. How to start those that have not been developed, and how to improve those that have already been operated, to adapt to modern conditions, cannot be achieved without first having a careful investigation and study to understand the truth and to plan. This kind of organization is still rare in Hebei, so this association intends to devote itself to this. To seek detailed information for the investigation and research of various economic undertakings, it is especially necessary to rely on experts to engage in it, so in addition to colleagues from the industrial and commercial circles, scholars and experts will also be extensively invited. Developing economic undertakings requires funds, or even the use of foreign capital, which is of course the trend. For the future development and improvement of economic undertakings in Hebei, there are some that can be achieved by its own strength, and some that need to draw on foreign capital, but what kind of undertakings need domestic or foreign funds, and how the required funds are used, must also be carefully investigated and studied by experts before there is a quasi-basis for mediation. Recently, there has been a strong advocacy of economic cooperation between China and Japan. This issue can indeed be carried out in the principle of equality and mutual benefit, but if economic cooperation is mentioned, what kind of undertakings are used for cooperation, and what kind of methods are used for cooperation, it is especially necessary to understand the relationship between the supply and demand of each other's materials and to adapt to the spirit of mutual benefit to achieve perfection, which is also not effective without prior investigation and research. Before the establishment of this association, there were many speculations in the society. Now that its purpose, organization, and methods have been specified in the articles of association, it will naturally invite the support of all parties. Colleagues have worked hard in social and economic undertakings on weekdays, and in the future they are still willing to uphold this position and give play to the spirit of serving society. Anything within the scope of economic affairs will be contributed at any time to its experience and research results on weekdays to help the conduct, and any facilities outside the scope will not dare to intervene because of the inability of colleagues to reach it."</p>

<p>Song Zheyuan, Commander of the Beiping and Tianjin Garrison, Takes Office, Diplomatic Affairs in Beiping and Tianjin are Handled by the Diplomatic Secretary on Behalf, the Headquarters of the 29th Army will be Moved to the Outskirts of Beiping</p>
<p>Beiping Newsletter: Song Zheyuan, the commander of the Beiping and Tianjin Garrison, took office at 11:00 am today (21st) in the auditorium of the headquarters. The people who attended the ceremony included Bao Wenyou, Rong Zhen, Yuan Liang, the mayor of Beiping, Shao Wenkai, the commander of the constabulary, Zhu Ruilin, the director of the public security bureau, and representatives from the military, political, business, banking and academic circles, as well as the heads of various departments of the garrison headquarters, totaling more than 500 people. After taking office, Song gave a speech, saying in brief, "Zheyuan was ordered by the central government to bear the responsibility of garrisoning Beiping and Tianjin. I am ashamed of my short intelligence and very frightened, because in the past, I handled local affairs and made no achievements for the country or the people. I am afraid that it will be difficult for me to achieve the central government's intentions and the expectations of all compatriots in the future when I garrison Beiping and Tianjin. The two cities of Beiping and Tianjin are the cultural center and the country's most important place. Former Commander Wang has garrisoned Beiping and Tianjin for several years, and the local area is quite peaceful. Zheyuan is less talented and learned than former Commander Wang by far. I sincerely hope that all compatriots will give more guidance, and I hope that the heads of various departments and staff of the headquarters, who are young people serving the country, will continue to work hard in the spirit of assisting former Commander Wang. Zheyuan has always believed that Chinese morality can maintain people's hearts and save the country, so he is permanently opposed to the Communist Party and advocates the promotion of the spirit of morality to save the country from danger and stabilize social order. Secondly, Beiping and Tianjin are areas where Chinese and foreigners gather, and it is especially important to adhere to the central government's intentions and foster good relations with neighboring countries in order to promote peace." Then, Gao Litang, the representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Bao Wenyou, the member of the Military Branch Association, and Shang Zhen, the chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, successively gave speeches, all expressing their expectations. The meeting adjourned after the speeches.</p>
<p>After taking office, Song met with reporters in the auditorium and expressed his feelings after taking office, saying in brief: (1) I hope that the troops and police who are responsible for local public security will continue to work hard to maintain it. (2) I hope that the elders and compatriots from all walks of life in Beiping and Tianjin will give instructions at any time, and I especially hope that the public opinion circles will give unceremonious instructions to avoid blunders. (3) I will work hard to implement the central government's intention of good neighborliness with foreign countries. (4) I am personally willing to do my best, work diligently and fulfill my duties in order to repay the elegance of all circles and relieve the central government's concern for the north. Zhu continued, "I have repeatedly received telegrams from the central government urging me to take office as soon as possible. I originally intended to take office as soon as possible, but I suddenly suffered from a cold, which delayed it for several days, and there was no other reason. The personnel of the garrison headquarters will not be changed. Liu Jialuan will concurrently serve as the chief of staff in his capacity as the head of the staff office. It is planned that Liu will still be appointed as the chief of staff, and the vacancy for the head of the staff office will be filled by someone else. The establishment of a diplomatic office has been decided to be abandoned due to funding and authority issues. In addition to important diplomatic matters being handled by the diplomatic authorities, secondary matters will be handled by the diplomatic secretary. The original garrison regiment has been returned to its establishment and will be reorganized by transferring a part of the 29th Army. The garrison headquarters' expenses are only more than 20,000 yuan per month, which is issued at 60%. Whether it will be increased in the future will be submitted again after considering the actual needs. Regarding the defense of Beiping and Tianjin, there is currently only one division of Feng Zhian's department stationed in Beiping. Another division will be transferred from Chahar Province to Beiping to protect it. The defense of Tianjin has been discussed with Chairman Shang (Zhen) and will be temporarily responsible by the Tianjin-Qingdao Security Command. How to deploy the police along the Beiping-Shenyang Railway will also be decided after discussing with Chairman Shang. In Chahar Province, the 38th Division will be left to defend it, and the headquarters of the 39th Army plans to move to Qinghe, Beiping. In order to handle affairs and communicate, the garrison headquarters will set up an office in Tianjin. After I take office and the headquarters affairs are arranged, I will go to Zhangjiakou to inspect the troops of the 29th Army. I also plan to visit the commanders of the foreign troops stationed in Tianjin and the Beiping municipal authorities. It has been rumored that there will be changes in the municipal authorities of Beiping, but as far as I know, Mayor Yuan is responsible for his work and the central government has no intention of changing him. Minister He's departmental affairs in Beijing are too complicated and it may be difficult for him to go north in the short term, but he may come to Beiping in the future." (21st)</p>
<p>Yam Xishan Drafted the Outline of Land Public Ownership (Continued)</p>
<p>Taking land public ownership as a counter-communist policy, the Counter-Communist Conference Decided on Many Important Cases</p>
<p>Answers to Questions: 21 Items</p>
<p>(Question 1) Should land public ownership be owned by the state? If it is advocated that it be owned by the village, then the full power is in the village. Is there a suspicion of encroaching on national sovereignty? (Answer) The village is the basic organization of the group life and the smallest unit of administration. Land owned by the village is a problem of distribution and use, not a problem of sovereignty. Even from the perspective of sovereignty, the village belongs to the county, the county belongs to the province, and the province belongs to the country. Sovereignty in the village is in the country. If we talk about the direct and indirect relationship of sovereignty, then sovereignty is in the country. How can the country deal with land without leaving the village? Sovereignty in the village, and the village cannot resist the state's handling of land. All land in the country belongs to the state, and all land belongs to the village. Owned by the village, there is a fact of ownership. Land owned by the state is also divided into villages and distributed to farmers for planting. In fact, it belongs to the village to say it is owned by the state. The fact of ownership is empty, and the village is near and the state is far away. Saying it is owned by the village, the villagers are easy to know and follow. Saying it is owned by the state, the villagers are difficult to understand and follow. (Question 2) The size of the village, the fertility of the land, and the population are different. If the land belongs to the village, will there be an unfair phenomenon in the distribution of land between villages? (Answer) There is no such thing as fairness or unfairness between villages. A small village with less land and fewer people is a large village with more land and more people, which is exactly fair. Even if there are places where there is less land, poor land and more people, those who are willing to live in this village must have other ways to make a living besides farming. Looking at the ferry crossing, the population is more than that of the rural areas, and there are those who make a living by boating. The population in the coastal areas is more than that of the rural areas, and there are those who make a living by fishing. The population in the commercial areas is more than that of the rural areas, and there are those who make a living by commerce. The population in the industrial areas is more than that of the rural areas, and there are those who make a living by industry. People's livelihood, like water going down, although the village boundaries are fixed, and people's residence is free, one is fixed and one is mobile. Even if there is unfairness, it can naturally tend to be fair. (Question 3) China's land is suffering from dispersion. If the land belongs to the village public, will it further promote its dispersion? (Answer) Land dispersion is a problem of use and has nothing to do with whether it is owned by the village or not. A village can have a cooperative farm, and several villages can have a cooperative farm, which is not impossible. (Question 4) The redistribution of land in various countries first requires clearing and measuring the land, and then statistically distributing it. It takes a long time and costs a lot. If it is advocated to solve the land problem, is it difficult to realize it in time according to China's current situation? (Answer) It is really difficult to distribute it if it is owned by the state. If it is owned by the village, it is very easy to do. The people in the village originally understand the land situation of a village. No investigation or clearing is needed, and it is clearer than the government sending strangers to investigate several times. Even if there is an investigation and clearing, it is better for the villagers to do it themselves. Not only does it not cost much money, but it also does not take much time. Moreover, it is good to statistically distribute it after clearing and investigating. It is not impossible to distribute it even without clearing or investigating. (Question 5) In administration, it is necessary to handle simple matters with few officials. Isn't it abandoning simplicity for complexity to hand it over to the countless villages that the country does not handle? (Answer) The execution of simplicity and control of complexity in administration is to find the unit of a matter. What the village does is to execute simplicity and control complexity. What the county does is difficult and ineffective. Land belongs to the village. As long as a village has a method, each village has its own method, which is a country has a method. This is a problem of a village having a method. Land owned by the state must have a method in the whole country before each village can have a method. This is a problem of whether the whole country has a method or not. It is easy for a village to have a method, and it is difficult for the whole country to have a method. Returning it to the state is abandoning the easy and taking the difficult. Even for land owned by the state, it should not abandon this village office that knows the roots and lives in the village to handle this matter. If this is abandoned and another person is found to handle it, it is necessary to find a majority of people, and saying that land is owned by the state is easy to arouse public resentment. Saying that the state buys it with public bonds and makes the people bear the burden is also easy to arouse public resentment. Saying that the government handles the distribution is easy to cause trouble and is even more likely to arouse public resentment, and it creates an opportunity</p>

<p>China-Europe and Eurasia Companies Strictly Prohibit Aerial Photography by Passengers. The English North China Quarterly Prints an Aerial View of the Capital. Although These Are Landscape Photos, It Is Difficult to Guarantee That They Will Not Be Used to Steal Military Intelligence.</p>
<p>The China-Europe and Eurasia Airlines Companies received instructions from the Ministry of Transportation stating that, "Regarding a public letter from the General Bureau of Land Surveying submitted by Director Wu Defang, stating, 'Regarding a report from Li Jinglu, Captain of the Aerial Surveying Team, stating, 'Upon reviewing the English North China Quarterly of June 23, it was found that it contains an aerial view of the capital (Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum), which was taken by Mete Lavoy while on a mail plane. It has been repeatedly ordered by the government that foreigners are not allowed to take photographs arbitrarily within Chinese airspace. Although the published photo is a landscape, the capital vicinity is densely populated with fortresses, and it is difficult to guarantee that it would not be used for clandestine photography to spy on military affairs. It seems that strict investigation and prohibition should be enforced to prevent any misconduct. We respectfully request that this be submitted to the Ministry and then to the Military Affairs Commission for investigation, and that the Eurasia and China Airlines Companies be instructed to strictly prohibit passengers from taking aerial photographs in the future, in order to prevent such occurrences and uphold national rights. Is this appropriate? We respectfully submit this document along with the aforementioned supplement for your review and instructions.' After investigation, the matters presented are factual. Therefore, we respectfully submit this document along with the aforementioned supplement for your review and instructions," along with a copy of the supplement to the Ministry. "Regarding the prohibition of aerial photography, our Ministry previously dispatched personnel to discuss measures for its suppression. Subsequently, your Ministry, in its public letter No. 1142 of September 30, 19, distributed three articles regarding measures for suppressing passengers on mail transport aircraft and inspection and surveillance measures for compliance. Now, according to the report from the Bureau, the English North China Summer Supplement contains an aerial view of the capital, taken by a foreigner on a mail plane. This is both a violation of regulations by the passenger and possibly due to the company's negligence in surveillance. We are enclosing the supplement and requesting that your Ministry reiterate the previous order, instructing the affiliated airlines to pay close attention to this matter." The English North China Summer Supplement has been sent to the Ministry for review regarding the suppression of passengers on mail transport aircraft. Our Ministry has repeatedly ordered all airlines to strictly implement the suppression measures and inspection and surveillance measures promulgated by the Ministry. Now that the incident of passengers taking photographs in the air has occurred again, it is evident that personnel at various stations of the companies have been negligent in inspecting and monitoring passengers. In accordance with the previous letter, in addition to issuing separate orders, we are urgently reiterating the previous order, urging the company to strictly instruct personnel at each station to comply with the suppression measures and inspection and surveillance measures promulgated by the Ministry, and to report the handling situation. This order has been complied with and reported by the two companies.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Bureau's "Gongping" Steamer Changes to Coastal Defense Route; Contract with "Haiyi" Steamer Terminated</h3>
<p>The "Haiyi" steamer, operated by the state-owned China Merchants Bureau on behalf of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was taken back by the China Merchants Company after its inaugural voyage on the coastal defense line on the 6th of this month due to a lack of mutual interest in cooperation. It has been subleased to the Hong Kong Yuannan Company for voyages to Southeast Asia. The contract previously signed by both parties has also been terminated. As the China Merchants Bureau considers the route to be quite prosperous in transporting overseas Chinese and goods, it has decided to replace the "Gongping" steamer, which originally sailed the Shanghai-Qingdao line, to the coastal defense route. The ship set sail from Shanghai at 6:00 AM yesterday, carrying a large number of passengers. It will stop at Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Haikou, and Beihai, and is expected to arrive in Haiphong in early next month.</p>

<h3>New Factory Boiler Explodes; Two Workers Injured; Both May Be in Critical Condition</h3>
<p>At the Quanxin Porcelain Factory, located at the intersection of Pingliang Road and Zhoujiazui Road, the boiler suddenly exploded at around 1:00 PM yesterday. Two workers were working on-site at the time and were unable to escape, resulting in injuries. The injured workers include Xu Ruiqing, 29 years old, from Jiangbei, who suffered head and waist injuries, and Chen Shunqiu, 41 years old, from Hunan, who suffered a head injury.

As the car arrived at the entrance of the lane, Guo was walking alone when a thug suddenly appeared from behind, pulled out a sharp knife, and slashed Guo's right ear. The wound was about an inch long, and Guo bled profusely and collapsed to the ground. The thug, seeing that his goal had been achieved, took the opportunity to flee without a trace. Shortly after, Guo regained consciousness and, carrying his wound, went to his friend Pan's residence to describe the incident. His friend immediately transported him to Renji Hospital for treatment and reported the case to the Loujiawan General Patrol Station, requesting the arrest of the perpetrator.</p>
<h3>Pudong Water Plant Commences Construction; Water Supply Expected by January Next Year</h3>
<p>The Pudong area is vast, with numerous factories and warehouses, and the population has been increasing year by year. However, the installation of tap water facilities is still lacking, which affects both sanitation and fire prevention. In light of this, the Municipal Government specially ordered the City Enterprise Trust Society to actively prepare for the project in October last year. After receiving the order, the Society worked diligently on the plan and has now started construction. Although there have been reports in the newspapers, they are brief and not detailed. In order to thoroughly understand the progress of the water plant, a reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited Mr. Tan Boying, the manager of the Society, yesterday to inquire about various matters. Mr. Tan kindly provided the following information:</p>
<p>Preparation Process. Since the Society received the Municipal Government's order to actively prepare for the Pudong Water Plant, it has been conducting precise research. It believes that the population of the Pudong area has increased sharply in recent years, and various docks, factories, and warehouses are densely located. Therefore, from the perspective of the urban area, Pudong is not only a residential area but also an industrial area due to convenient transportation. The need for water is very urgent, and fire prevention facilities must also be considered. After repeated investigations and studies, the daily water volume must be at least 3 million gallons or more. Since the water plant is run by the city, the water quality and materials must not be taken lightly. Therefore, the machines and steel pipes used by the plant are all ordered from well-known manufacturers and are of the latest type. All old-fashioned and uneconomical equipment is completely avoided. The water production equipment also adopts the latest methods. At present, the machines and water pipes ordered by the Society have been successively delivered, and the construction of the entire plant has already started. It is being undertaken by the Chengtai Construction Company. At the same time, the pipe laying work has also started. Water supply is expected to begin in May of next year. In addition, since the Society began preparing for the project last year, all work has been carried out by the original technical personnel of the Society through division of labor and cooperation. Therefore, the preparation cost is less than 300 yuan, striving to reduce costs in order to live up to Mayor Wu's expectations.</p>
<p>Pipe Laying Work. The Society's planning and research on the laying of water pipes is also very painstaking. This is because (1) Pudong's terrain is long and narrow, and it is very easy to draw water along the Pudong River, so tap water does not seem to be very necessary. (2) Pudong's roads are curved, and it is impossible to go straight, but the laying of water pipes cannot follow the curvature of the roads, because steel water pipes are not comparable to rubber pipes. (3) Pudong's users are not as dense as those in Puxi, but unexpected large-scale water use, such as fire fighting, cannot be avoided. Therefore, the work of laying water pipes must take into account both technology and economy, which is not easy. However, after research by several experts, the Society has resolved the above-mentioned difficult problems one by one.</p>
<p>Future Business. After the establishment of the water plant, the amount of water used by various docks, factories, and warehouses in Pudong will definitely be large. The insurance premiums saved by these factories each year due to the installation of tap water facilities will also be considerable. In addition, there are more than 100 tiger stoves in Pudong. Because it is difficult to get water, they may not pay much attention to hygiene. In the future, water supply from the water plant will provide great convenience to the old stoves. As for residential water use, water meters will be installed uniformly, and prices will be fair. In order to facilitate the general public, water taps will be set up everywhere for people to fetch water. Regarding fire prevention, new-style faucets will also be erected in the water supply area for disaster relief. From now on, major disasters in Pudong may be reduced.</p>
<h3>Death from Severe Injuries; Coroner's Examination of Wang De Kui; The Deceased Has a 94-Year-Old Mother; The Livelihood of His Wife, Concubine, and Family Is a Problem</h3>
<p>Wang De Kui, a native of Yancheng, 48 years old, lived at No. 4 Leyi Lane, Annakin Road in the French Concession. He previously worked for the French Concession Police, serving as a detective in Precinct 27, and was later promoted to detective supervisor. After a suspension due to an incident, he worked as a deputy inspector at the Great World amusement park for five or six years. In mid-April of this year, Wang De Kui discovered that Tianjin native Wang Enrong, a junior inspector at the Great World, was behaving improperly and reported it to the administration office. On the 20th of the same month, Enrong was dismissed. As a result, Wang Enrong harbored resentment. He recently acquired a sharp knife used for selling fruit and sharpened the tip and back of the blade. On the night of the 19th of this month, Wang Enrong hid the sharp knife and waited at the Great World near the ice rink. At around 10:00 PM, he saw Wang De Kui passing by, rushed up, and stabbed him twice, once in the right rib and once in the right waist. The wounds were both about two inches deep. The park's patrolmen chased after Wang Enrong to the ticket booth at the entrance, apprehended the assailant, recovered the murder weapon, and sent him to the police station. Wang De Kui was transported by car to Renji Hospital for treatment. The assailant was sent to the Second Special District Court the next day for questioning and detention, and the hearing was postponed to the 30th, pending the victim's recovery and further investigation. Wang De Kui entered the hospital and underwent surgery by doctors. However, due to the severity of his injuries, the treatment was ineffective, and he died at 7:30 PM on the 21st. All details have been reported in this newspaper. Wang's body was reported to the police station by the hospital and sent to the Coroner's Office of the Tongren Fuyuan Branch for an autopsy. The police station, considering the case to be urgent, reported it to the Prosecutor's Office of the Second Special District Court yesterday, Sunday. Chief Prosecutor Qiao Wanxuan and others ascended to the court. Detective Zhang Chunsheng reported the investigation. Wang De Kui's son, Wang JiaShi, surrendered himself, knelt on the ground, and requested justice, stating that the defendant had killed his father with premeditation and requesting severe punishment. The officer ordered the police station to bring a public prosecution against the defendant. The defendant, Wang Enrong, was escorted to the case by Detective Supervisor Lu Zhixiang and Detective Xu Guilin. According to Wang Enrong's statement, he did not intentionally stab the deceased to death and only stabbed him once in the leg. The second stab occurred when the deceased lunged at him. Chief Prosecutor Qiao reviewed the statements and ordered that it be determined that Wang De Kui had died from knife stabs before death. The body was released to Wang De Kui's son, Wang Jiabao, for burial. The autopsy report was filed for future reference. After the autopsy, the family took the body to the Shanghai Funeral Home on Xujiahui Road for cremation. The deceased's family includes a 94-year-old white-haired mother, a wife, a concubine, and several children. The entire family depended on the deceased for their livelihood. Now, they have suddenly suffered this tragedy, and the family's livelihood has become a problem.</p>
<h3>Wang Jixun Opens Salt Manufacturing Company; Sued by Shareholders for Embezzlement; Many Criticisms of the Company's Accounts; Wang Submits Documents Requesting Review</h3>
<p>Wang Jixun, who was a wealthy merchant in the early Republic of China, retired due to old age and is now a resident of Shanghai, living with his family at No. 8 Jingyu Lane, Weihaiwei Road. He gathered shares to establish the Dayuan Salt Manufacturing Company, with Wang serving as the company's general manager, with the intention of using the salt industry to achieve the wealth of Tao Zhu. However, soon, differences arose among the company's shareholders, and they were once involved in litigation. Now, a lawyer has filed a criminal lawsuit with the First Special District Court, accusing Wang Jixun of embezzlement and breach of trust. The court has repeatedly summoned Wang for questioning, but the case has been repeatedly postponed because Wang has not appeared. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Feng opened a court hearing, and Wang Jixun finally submitted his defense through his lawyer. The plaintiff, Shen Kunhe, criticized the company's accounts, claiming that there were many types of suspicious amounts and requesting that the company's account books be retrieved and a detailed review be conducted by an accountant. Wang's lawyer argued that there was evidence for all payments and requested that the court review it. The defendant, Wang Jixun, also launched an attack, claiming that Shen had intentions for the company and was now reluctantly filing a case. He requested that his son be allowed to represent him at the next hearing. Judge Feng then adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<h3>Trafficking in Military Weapons; Undoubtedly Supplying Bandits; Shao Afang and Others Sentenced</h3>
<p>Lu Liankui, Chief Inspector of the General Inspection Office, Detectives Wang Chengying and Zhou Honglin, on the 16th of this month at 2:30 PM, cracked down on an arms trafficking organization at two locations: the kitchen shed at No. 30 Lane 74 and No. 163 Lane 73, Baikai'er Road. They seized nine handguns, 1,000 rounds of ammunition, and 18 magazines. The suspects, including Ningbo native Shao Afang, Chou Amao, and his local wife Fang, were taken to the Huishan Police Station and detained separately. The next morning, they were properly sent to the First Special District Court for detailed questioning, which was reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, Judge Xiao Xiefen opened the Third Criminal Court for review. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the工部局, stated that, as modified, in the police station the defendant Chou Amao admitted that the weapons were purchased from a Japanese man named Yimai on a certain ship. Such unlicensed weapons are used to supply bandits for robbery and murder. The police station also has considerable control over the source. Now, a public prosecution is filed in accordance with Article 87 of the Criminal Law for the crime of endangering public safety, requesting severe punishment. The defendant Shao Afang insisted that Chou Amao asked him to sell them on his behalf, with a commission of two yuan per gun. Chou Amao confessed without hesitation, stating that it was his first time and requesting leniency. Chou Fang's testimony was evasive. Judge Xiao sentenced Shao Afang to one year of imprisonment, Chou Amao to one year and six months, and Chou Fang to two months. The number of days of detention before the judgment is finalized will be used to offset the imprisonment at a rate of two days for one month. The guns and ammunition were confiscated.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Industry Notifies Cosmetics Factories to Register</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cosmetics Industry Association received a notification from the Ministry of Industry, Gongzi No. 13215, stating that the Ministry had formulated factory registration rules in December of the 20th year and submitted them for approval to carry out factory registration. In May of this year, the rules were revised and promulgated for implementation. However, to date, only a small number of factories have registered, and the overall situation of domestic industry is still difficult to fully understand, so that there is no basis for the implementation of relief, rewards, supervision, and control of industry. A copy of the revised factory registration rules is enclosed, and you are requested to forward them to your affiliated factories and register as soon as possible in accordance with the law, and report the handling situation. In addition to distribution, this notification is specifically given. A copy of the revised factory registration rules is attached. Minister Chen Gongbo.</p>
<h3>National Products Market Actively Underway; Domestic Famous Native Products Welcomed to Participate</h3>
<p>Since the announcement of the National Products Market to be held at the original site of the New World, various factories have rushed to register. The market, because this place is a must-see for foreign tourists, in order to improve the status of national products in foreign trade, insists on strict review of the goods participating in the sale, so it has specially hired Wang Hanqiang, Pan Dechun, Qian Chengxu, Lu Xingzhuang, and others from the national products industry as review committee members, and has also hired Xu Yunhui, Cheng Shouzhong, Ma Xishen, Sun Chen, Xu Qingwen, and others as design committee members. It is heard that there are considerable restrictions on the types of industries, and the market will do its best to collect unique native products, in order to be perfect. As for the site rental fee, the pricing is extremely cheap, with the lowest at 30 yuan and the highest at 45 yuan. If you rent for three consecutive months, you can also get preferential treatment. The registration office is located on the second floor of the market.</p>
<h3>Shanghai County Advocates Group Weddings; Scheduled for November 11</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Government established the group wedding system, provinces, cities, and counties have followed suit. Now, the Minhang Mass Education Center in Shanghai County believes that in view of the current rural economic difficulties, group weddings can save people money and improve the marriage system, so it is also making every effort to promote it. The director of the center, Jin Zuobin, has drafted measures and the fees are extremely cheap, in order to encourage participation. The first group wedding is scheduled to be held on November 11, and the county magistrate or Director Zhu of the Education Bureau will be invited to officiate the wedding. In recent days, people who want to get married have been registering to participate.</p>

<p>Public Telegram Released. To all compatriots across the country via Shanghai newspapers, the severity of today's era can be said to be unparalleled. Its situation is truly the same as in the past, which should be known to all people across the country. However, today's era has been passed down from the era of the past, so its severity is continuous and progressive, and definitely not fragmented and sudden. All crises are closely related to the world situation. Tracing back to the Wall Street bank collapse in New York in 1929, it triggered a major economic panic in the world. The great powers, having lost their development capacity in their own countries, competed to open up the Chinese market as a way out for the national economy. As a result, the pressure on our country is indescribable, industries are declining day by day, society is becoming increasingly unstable, and international political and economic pressures are emerging one after another. Our country is in a situation surrounded by enemies on all sides. How can it survive? The aggressive forces of the great powers have already driven straight in and are becoming increasingly profound and acute. In the past, we felt as though we were walking on thin ice, but today we are being stripped bare. The cup of suffering increases with time, and the economy is declining day by day. At this moment, we must quickly catch up, jointly seek swift responses and clear understanding, see through the hidden dangers, understand the opportunities, deeply observe society, and use the wisdom and intelligence of the masses to save the situation. My colleagues deeply appreciate the urgent task currently facing us, which is to save the country. In addition to political action, the economy comes first. We follow the legacy of Mr. Sun Yat-sen and establish a new life movement. We dare to speak out loudly and promote national products. At the beginning of the establishment of this association, we have the courage to move forward and the spirit of never retreating, to consume national products and lead by example, and we are willing to gather the majority of enthusiastic citizens to jointly introduce national products to the public, to fulfill the responsibility of ordinary people, and to bear this important mission of economic salvation of the country. We respectfully ask all compatriots across the country to work together and earnestly consume national products, and to be loyal and self-motivated and fulfill their duties to seek ways to save themselves and the country. The future of national products truly depends on this. Shanghai Citizens' National Products Consumption Association.</p>
<p>Letter to the Citizens. Dear compatriots, in a China shrouded in the fog of global economic recession, the national economy is in a precarious state. The successive major events of natural and man-made disasters have shattered the illusions of the people who are trying to gradually restore the prosperity of the past. In this autumn of crisis and survival, we should use all our strength to reverse our own destiny. Drunkenness and apathy cannot prolong our current and future difficulties. The paper image of singing and dancing peace has been torn apart by the power of the times. The collapse of our country's rural economy and the ravages of bandits and foreign insults all make it possible for us to immediately transform from a semi-colony to a colony that cannot be bargained for. Moreover, according to the total value of imported foreign goods from the customs over the years, in the fourth year of the Republic of China, it was more than 74.3 million yuan, and in the 20th year, it was as high as more than 215.6 million yuan. After the 21st year, although the import of foreign goods decreased due to insufficient purchasing power of the Chinese people, every year more than 100 million yuan of silver dollars have to be sent abroad. With this big leak, we have fallen into a position of no return. Compatriots, please do not be obsessed with relying on the strength of others to consolidate yourselves. There is no such cheap fact in the world. We must understand that to save everything, everything, we must rely on our own strength, and it will never succeed. We feel that the current crisis of national products in our country requires us to think of a simple, easy, practical, and effective method of self-help for each person. This method is for each person to embrace the true consumption of national products. If everyone can absolutely consume national products, profits will not flow out, industry and commerce will develop, our nation will have the possibility of self-sufficiency, and the country will have a basis for becoming strong. We are organizing the National Products Consumption Association for the sake of saving the country and ourselves, in order to find a way out for our nation. In particular, we hope that the compatriots in this city will use the power of the masses to support the growth of our small contribution and achieve great results in Shanghai, which holds the economic lifeline of the country. Compatriots who are determined to save the country, let us all come and earnestly and faithfully implement this most effective emergency mission of consuming national products! In fact, this is the key to the future way out for all compatriots.</p>
<p>Lucky Draw for Gifts. Yesterday, the guests all drew lots to receive gifts, including Renfeng Machinery Dyeing and Weaving Factory white fine cloth clothing materials, Shengsheng Ranch milk food products, Zhenfeng Cotton Weaving Union purchase gift certificates, China Chemical Industry Society cosmetics, China-France Pharmacy Renden, Huacheng Tobacco Company cigarettes, Huafei Tobacco Company cigarettes, Guanshengyuan food products, Taikang Company food products, Guohua Factory light bulbs, Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company cigarettes, Yonghe Industrial Company cosmetics, Family Industry Society cosmetics, and many other products.</p>
<h3>Woman Argues with Lover and Attempts Suicide by Poisoning</h3>
<p>A woman surnamed Cai, 27 years old, a native of Zhuzhai Town, Xixiang, local area, cohabited with Jin Jilian (30 years old), a boatman from Anhui, for several years. Recently, Jin lost his job and became unemployed, which caused financial problems and frequent quarrels. Recently, they rented a small room at No. 115 Huageniao Road in the French Concession. Recently, one day, Ms. Cai and her boyfriend had snacks outside, and someone told the lover that he suspected her of infidelity. On the evening of the 19th of this month, he asked Ms. Cai to scold him, which caused a quarrel. In a fit of anger, Ms. Cai had a momentary thought. The next morning (20th), she got up at 8:00 AM and went out to buy a small packet of raw opium, returned home and swallowed it. Then she told her younger brother, Cai Guangen, that she was dying and told him that after her death, the coffin must be transported back to her hometown for burial, and she must not give up Shanghai. After saying that, she fell into bed and became unconscious. Her younger brother was shocked when he heard this. At this time, Jin was also out and had not returned. He immediately asked his younger brother to invite a cohabitant to try to send Ms. Cai to the Shangchi Hospital near Hengmaoli for diagnosis. She was in critical condition and could not be detained, so he asked her to be carried back. Her younger brother could not bear to see his sister die tragically, and still wanted to save her, so he sent her to Renji Hospital again, but it was still ineffective. She died at noon. The hospital reported it to the French Concession Police, who sent the body to the Coroner's Office of the Tongren Fuyuan Branch for an autopsy. The police found a box of opium and a packet of white powder in her home. At noon yesterday, Chief Prosecutor Qiao of the Second Special Court and a forensic officer arrived at the office to examine the body. The family members went to the countryside yesterday because it was Sunday to notify the deceased's parents. No one arrived. The officer ordered that it be determined that Jin Cai was poisoned to death during her lifetime, and the body would be temporarily collected by the Tongren Fuyuan Branch and handed over to the family members for collection.</p>
<h3>Qiu Bingliang's Electricity Theft Exposed; Abandons Child and Flees; Electricity Company Finds Nothing</h3>
<p>Qiu Bingliang, a native of Pudong, 40 years old, owns the Dafadianqi Material Company, which sells radios and electric fans at No. 2 Xier, Dongxinqiao Street, French Concession. He has been in business for many years, and his business is not bad. His family also lives upstairs. The electricity bill for the electric lights and electrical appliances used each month is usually more than 30 yuan. In recent months, the electricity used has only been about 7 or 8 yuan per month. Therefore, the French Electricity Company became suspicious. A few nights ago, at around 9:00 PM, Chinese and foreign staff went to the store to check the meter. After checking, there were no flaws at first. After cutting off the main power line of the electric lights, the electric lights installed upstairs were all turned off, but the ones installed in the store still had electricity, so they knew that they were stealing electricity. However, the method of stealing electricity was to connect to the power line on the road. At this time, Qiu Bingliang</p>

<p>Economic Supplement: The Arrival of Sir Otto Niemeyer</p>
<p>Sen Yu</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>When silver is flowing out of the country, and China is suffering extreme financial pain, the so-called "good intentions(?)" of British aid seem to deserve gratitude beyond measure!</p>
<p>But what is "good intention"? Leaving aside remote events, just look at the actual actions of Britain when the United States implemented its silver policy. We really can't find the so-called "good intention" anywhere! The most important players in shipping large quantities of silver out of the country, aren't they authentic British banks? Frankly speaking, their shipping silver out of the country is not a simple speculation, but a planned disruptive act: it wants to make China's financial turmoil even more complex, thereby deepening the Chinese people's resentment towards the United States, and then, through various threats, drawing China into its embrace, or at least, attempting to bring China's currency into the sterling bloc.</p>
<p>All kinds of aid, such as the so-called "loans" and "development," are not all for its own sake! The world economic panic is making the once great Britain decline day by day. Its position in China is no longer what it used to be, sitting high in the first seat. Recently, the great expansion of Japanese power has given Britain the most serious threat, forcing it to panic and seek ways to save itself.</p>
<p>However, international relations are too complex, forcing Britain to be extremely cautious about its policies towards China. How should it consider the attitudes of other countries! In particular, how should it avoid Japan's obstruction? How should it persuade China?!… These are all key points that the British government must plan. And Sir Otto Niemeyer's arrival is precisely one of the important steps to solve the above problems.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>Not long ago, Britain, seeing the unrestricted expansion of Japanese power in China, sang about the revival of the international consortium and the so-called Nanjing Currency Conference, etc. This attempt was: (1) to use international joint action to contain Japan's excessive progress; (2) to use the smokescreen of international cooperation to seize the most favorable rights and interests from it, such as the Nanjing Currency Conference, which was an important battle position to seize China's monetary power; (3) to please China, so that the Chinese people know how much Britain cares about itself, in order to maintain close relations between China and Britain, so as to facilitate various advances.</p>
<p>But these points completely failed: (1) Japan immediately gave Britain a head-on blow, clearly stating that China is the China that Japan wants to monopolize(?), and does not allow other countries to interfere; (2) the interests of the various imperialist countries are not consistent. The United States, France, and other countries fully know that Britain's international cooperation plan has various intentions, and naturally do not want to be used by it, so they responded with a negative attitude; (3) Perhaps some Chinese people are willing to win over Britain, but most of them have already seen through Britain's "magic lantern," so the Chinese side does not show much active attitude towards Britain. Moreover, China is in such a complex international situation that even if it really wants to embrace Britain, it will in fact be subject to great constraints.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>Britain cannot simply ignore China after all, and Sir Otto Niemeyer has come east before the representatives of various countries, and has been in Japan for many days, and will arrive in Shanghai on the 21st of this month. Before Sir Otto Niemeyer set off, it was reported that he had met with key figures in the American financial world in London; but the opposition between the two major imperialist powers, Britain and the United States, could not be eliminated after all, and they obviously broke up unhappily in informal talks. Sir Otto Niemeyer originally planned to go to the United States to talk with the Washington authorities on his way to China, and also planned to travel with the American representative; now that he has abandoned the United States and colluded with Japan, it can further prove that British-American cooperation has been declared hopeless. And those Chinese who still have illusions about the British-American joint system can probably wake up now!</p>
<p>Since international cooperation is impossible, and Britain's current environment does not allow it to confront Japan alone, it has to re-plan a compromise between Britain and Japan to jointly divide the Chinese market. Under such a strategy, Sir Otto Niemeyer's trip to Japan is actually more important than his trip to China by a million times! He is nominally sent to China, but he goes to Japan first; in fact, it is more appropriate to say that going to Japan is the main purpose, and coming to China is secondary.</p>
<p>Although the attitude of diplomats is ambiguous and elusive, we can obtain considerable facts from the opposite side of their words and actions. If we take the international environment in which Britain is located as the warp, and Sir Otto Niemeyer's recent words and actions in Japan as the weft, and analyze the main points of Britain's current policy towards Japan—that is, the conditions for Sir Otto Niemeyer's negotiations with the Japanese authorities, we can make the following conjectures: (1) Britain is extremely willing to compromise with Japan. Britain recognizes Japan's vested interests in Northeast China and does not hinder Japan's advances in North China and Northwest China; Japan will not infringe on Britain's power in the Yangtze River basin and South China—in simple terms, Britain abandons its interests in North China, and Japan stops its activities in Central and South China. (2) Britain recognizes Japan's political and other economic advantages in China; but Japan must not hinder China's currency from joining the sterling bloc. (3) Joint loans to China. (4) Britain and Japan jointly confront the Soviet Union. Britain assists Japan's advance to Outer Mongolia; Japan assists Britain's advance to Xinjiang, in order to drive out Soviet power in China. (5) Britain guarantees that it will never unite with the United States against Japan. Britain will also help Japan suppress the United States in terms of naval ratios; but Japan must not infringe on Britain's power in the Pacific region. If an accident occurs in East Africa and the Mediterranean, Japan must also guarantee the safety of British colonies, in order to avoid Britain's worries about the rear. (6) The resolution of other commodity dumping issues, etc.</p>
<p>These are all the main points that Britain is willing to compromise with Japan, and especially (1), (2), (3), and (4) are direct Chinese issues. However, what will Japan do? According to our research, it seems that we cannot be optimistic for Britain: (1) Japan has the determination to monopolize China, and is now expanding its vision from the Yellow River basin southward to the Yangtze River basin; as for Japan's operation in South China, it is not only economic, but also has important military significance in the future Pacific War, so it is absolutely impossible for Japan to give up Central and South China. (2) The gain or loss of China's monetary power is closely related to commodity sales and capital investment. Japan will certainly prevent China from joining the dollar bloc, but it is also unwilling for Britain to obtain China's monetary power; it is actively creating a Far East currency bloc to compete with the US dollar, pound sterling, etc. (3) Japan has already expressed its disapproval of joint loans to China. It rejects any country's interference with the slogan of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. (4) The interests of the two countries seem to be more consistent on this point, and a compromise may be possible; however, Japan's ambitions for Xinjiang are also not shallow, so it is still not possible to be fully optimistic about the future. (5) Some degree of compromise may be possible. (6) It is difficult for the interests to be consistent, and there is probably no hope of resolution for a while.</p>
<p>Also, Japan will inevitably put forward the issue of recognizing "Manchukuo," which is embarrassing for Britain. Moreover, in the current shocking situation in Italy and Abyssinia, Britain is using the League of Nations to restrain Italy, and naturally does not dare to be the first to violate the League of Nations' "non-recognition" resolution. This issue does form an obstacle to British-Japanese negotiations.</p>
<p>The above points regarding the division of the Chinese market, except that (4) may be able to obtain considerable compromise "temporarily," the three main points (1), (2), and (3) have little possibility of coordination. Sir Otto Niemeyer's trip to Japan this time does not seem to be receiving a warm reception from the Japanese authorities, and the attitude expressed by the Japanese authorities, as well as public opinion from all sides, is obviously disappointing to Sir Otto Niemeyer. The pan-Asianism has shattered Sir Otto Niemeyer's plans!</p>
<p>Naturally, we dare not say that there is absolutely no possibility of compromise in the British-Japanese opposition in China. Since Britain cannot obtain the above-mentioned ideals and has no power to turn against Japan, it has to accommodate Japan under the tense situation in Europe and Africa. Perhaps Britain will propose to Japan or has already proposed: "Britain does not hinder all of Japan's actions in China; it only requires that Japan does not infringe on Britain's inherent rights and interests." At the same time, isolated Japan does need Britain's help in its relations with the United States and the Soviet Union, so in order not to completely disappoint Britain, it may allow Britain to retain part of its rights and interests in China (but certainly not all).</p>
<p>Such a compromise is no different from Britain's surrender to Japan, but if Japan can really guarantee Britain's part of its inherent rights and interests in China, then it may not be a source of comfort for the British; however, we dare not be optimistic for Britain at all. Japan's ultimate goal is to monopolize China. At a certain stage, it may take some consideration of Britain's interests; but when necessary, it will naturally act recklessly regardless of everything! Finally, with the increasing progress of Japanese power, the power of Britain (as well as other countries) in China will inevitably decline day by day.</p>
<p>In short, the conflicts of interest between Britain and Japan are numerous. It is very difficult for Sir Otto Niemeyer's trip to Japan to achieve a satisfactory result!</p>
<p>(IV)</p>
<p>What will Sir Otto Niemeyer do after he arrives in China? Originally, if Japan agreed to the points that Britain hoped for, Sir Otto Niemeyer's work in China could proceed according to the planned schedule, which would be much simpler; he would certainly use threats and inducements to make China succumb to the British-Japanese division plan. However, now that Sir Otto Niemeyer has suffered setbacks in Japan, his mission after arriving in China has to feel more troublesome. According to our current speculation, Sir Otto Niemeyer will probably carry out the following tasks in China in addition to investigating China's economic situation anytime and anywhere: (1) Consolidate past loans and investments; (2) Provide new loans to China alone; (3) Persuade China to join the sterling bloc; (4) Establish a foundation for anti-Japanese sentiment.</p>
<p>Let us analyze the future of these four points: (1) Although consolidating past loans and investments may not cause problems, the procedures are troublesome and time-consuming. Sir Otto Niemeyer and the Chinese authorities can only decide on a consolidation principle. (2) The Chinese authorities do desire loans very much, but if British loans to China are unconditional, there will be no guarantee for capital, and they will certainly not be willing to do so; if conditions are attached or if they hinder China's sovereignty, they will certainly arouse China's resistance. Moreover, international relations are complex, and there is a possibility of being obstructed by other countries at any time, not only Japan. There are many past facts that can serve as clear evidence of this. Therefore, even if China and Britain negotiate loans, they must be carried out in secret. (3) There is very little possibility of China joining the sterling bloc. On the one hand, Japan and the United States will do their best to oppose it, and on the other hand, China may not welcome it; the failure of Sassoon's pound bond plan is a good experience. (4) This work is very difficult and cannot be undertaken hastily. Its future depends on how future international situations change.</p>
<p>From this point of view, it is also difficult for Sir Otto Niemeyer to fully realize his original hopes when he comes to China. Sir Otto Niemeyer is indeed regarded as an all-powerful expert, but people are ultimately limited by the environment. What can he do if he has no place to use his abilities!</p>
<p>However, we cannot say that Sir Otto Niemeyer will return without any results. At least, the lessons he learned in Japan and the information he obtained from his investigations in China will be very meaningful reference materials for the British government.</p>
<h3>Sir Otto Niemeyer's Visit to China and the Prospects for International Loans</h3>
<p>(9/18 Anniversary)</p>
<p>Pan Mingshan</p>
<p>Sir Otto Niemeyer, the British government's chief economic adviser, accompanied by Paget of the Treasury and Rogers, an expert from the Bank of England, left Japan on September 19 on the Shanghai Maru to come to China, and is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 21st. On August 10, Sir Otto Niemeyer met with reporters before leaving London and said: The purpose of his visit to China is to investigate the current economic situation in China and report to the government. He also said that this trip to the East shows the government's concern for China's financial and economic difficulties, and he will also discuss cooperation with other relevant countries to formulate a concrete plan to help China's economic recovery. This is the most important goal. Sir Otto Niemeyer's mission to China has a plan for economic assistance to China, which is well known to both Chinese and foreign people.</p>
<p>Sir Otto Niemeyer arrived in Japan on September 6 and visited Foreign Minister Hirota, Finance Minister Takahashi, and Bank of Japan President Fukai one after another to inquire about the Japanese side's opinions on issues such as Anglo-Japanese cooperation and economic assistance to China. Sir Otto Niemeyer's visit to Japan this time is of great significance. Since the Great War, the Far Eastern market has been rising steadily. Britain's economic position is by no means an enemy of Japan. The urgent tasks that Britain is concerned about at present are: One is to assist China's economy so that it can recover and prosper and strengthen its purchasing power; the other is to maintain its economic position in the Far East under the open door policy, and to request Japan's understanding for the above matters. Looking back at the policies adopted by Japan, according to foreign reports, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance took the opportunity of Sir Otto Niemeyer's visit to Japan to discuss economic assistance to China and planned to adopt the following four principles to exchange opinions with Britain: (1) To seek the adjustment of Anglo-Japanese relations, it is necessary to raise not only China's financial and economic problems, but also the correct understanding of the awakening and development of East Asian people in Japan, China, Siam, etc. by Britain. (2) Japan has a population of 90 million and hopes that Britain will open up its sparsely populated colonies such as Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, and will not hinder the entry and exit of Japanese goods in the above areas. Japan can seek cooperation with Britain in markets such as China "Manchukuo," etc. Britain also allows East Asia to be the scope of Japan's activities. (3) To require Britain to give Japan a fair distribution of raw materials in its colonies. (4) Japan believes that if Britain cannot recognize the above principles, then for China's financial and economic plans, seeking Japan's cooperation is only a piecemeal problem and is far from Anglo-Japanese coordination. In short: it is nothing more than requiring the opening up of British colonies, and on the one hand, it does not allow hindering Japan's development on the Far Eastern continent. The arrogance is unbearable. Whether Britain can accept these principles is questionable. At the moment, the situation in Italy and Abyssinia is becoming increasingly tense. Once Britain is dragged into the vortex, its military force will be limited and it will not be able to take care of Hong Kong, Singapore, India, etc. in the Far East. If it does not compromise with Japan, it will be difficult to avoid Japan's invasion. The difficulty of the situation is obvious to everyone. If various plans are not understood by the Japanese side, or Britain cannot tolerate the exchange conditions disclosed by the Japanese side, Sir Otto Niemeyer's investigation, even if he has excellent plans, will be difficult for the British government to adopt for a while. This is a very obvious fact.</p>
<p>Our country is an independent country. Various countries provide economic assistance to improve China's commercial and financial status. In our country, it can be used for production and construction, so that the domestic economic situation can be slightly improved and the market purchasing power can be strengthened. Lenders can increase the sales of goods and maintain the market they have obtained, and our country can also use foreign capital to seek the development of production and construction. Both parties will benefit, which is what the Prime Minister called using foreign capital to develop our country's construction. If the British economic assistance to China is sincere, it does not need to seek the consent of the United States and other relevant countries. Sir Otto Niemeyer's visit to the East this time took the route of Japan and visited Japanese officials and the public to seek opinions on economic assistance. This is to acknowledge that Japan has a special position in East Asia. However, it is not known that under the current international situation, it is difficult for Britain and Japan to have the same pace in their perceptions of our country. Let me briefly explain it again to show the differences between the two parties.</p>
<p>It is difficult for Britain and Japan to agree on a plan for economic assistance to China. Japan advocates economic control over China, implements its so-called Asian Monroe Doctrine, and achieves the Sino-Japanese "Manchukuo" economic bloc that Japan hopes for day and night. What Britain hopes for is to maintain the current balance of power under the sphere of influence it has obtained and not to allow third parties to invade. Moreover, economic assistance to China is nothing more than investment. Britain has always hoped to maintain its superior position under the balance of power, so it has followed the example of the Four-Power Banking Consortium and jointly lent money to China by Britain, the United States, France, and Japan, so that its superior position can be maintained without falling. Various plans are carried out based on this principle. However, Japan has designed to obstruct the joint lending to China by Britain, the United States, France, and Japan. It views China as a forbidden fruit and does not allow others to intervene, so it sings the high tune of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation to realize its Asian Monroe Doctrine, exclude the rights obtained by the powers in China, and achieve its ambitions for hegemony. Therefore, it does not approve of joint investment but starts with individual investment. In recent years, Sino-Japanese economic cooperation has been sung to the clouds, and various production plans have been carried out in various parts of North China, such as mining and cotton planting industries, which are jointly organized by Chinese and Japanese merchants and carried out from North China, gradually expanding to various parts of Central China. Britain has a superior position in the Far East and is fearful of Japan's keen progress, so it has first tried to explore the intentions of the Japanese government and the public with a joint plan for economic assistance to China. They are scheming against each other, doing their best, and who knows how those who are meat on the chopping board will escape this difficult situation!</p>
<p>International loans to China have a long history. Looking back at the past, it actually originated in the second year of the reign of Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty, when the banking consortia of the four countries of China, Britain, the United States, Germany, and France organized a banking consortium to borrow 100 million yuan with the tax revenue of the three northeastern provinces as collateral. This was the beginning of the banking consortium's loans to China. By the time the Republic of China was established. Russia and Japan were powerful in the Far East, so the two countries of Japan and Russia joined, and the Six-Power Banking Consortium was thus established. After the second year of the Republic of China, Yuan Shikai came to power. At the time of the Second Revolution, in order to cope with this revolutionary climax, Yuan Shikai did not hesitate to sign harsh treaties and borrowed 25 million pounds from the Six-Power Banking Consortium, but the United States abandoned its past plan, so it was actually the five countries of Britain, France, Japan, Russia, and Germany. This was the beginning of the banking consortium's actual loans. When the European War broke out, all countries were dragged into the vortex, and Germany and Russia withdrew from the banking consortium invisibly. Britain, France, and other countries were exhausted, so the banking consortium was dissolved invisibly. Only Japan was lending money to China, and thus created a special superior position in China. Japan's position in China was rising steadily, and the United States and other countries could not help but be jealous, so the United States initiated the organization of a new banking consortium as a lending agency, and the new Four-Power Banking Consortium of Britain, the United States, France, and Japan was established in the ninth year of the Republic of China. Since the Northern Expedition of the Revolutionary Army, this banking consortium has long lost its basis. This is a general outline of international loans to China.</p>
<p>Whether international loans to China are beneficial or harmful depends on how foreign capital is used. In the past, our country's foreign debts were all of a political nature and were only for consumption and not for production, so there were more harms than benefits. At this time, rural areas are bankrupt, finance is exhausted, and natural and man-made disasters follow one after another. It is an urgent matter to wait for economic assistance from foreign countries. Regardless of Japan's individual economic assistance to China and the consistent pace of Anglo-Japanese joint investment, the sovereignty is in our hands, and the lenders cannot interfere and absolutely cannot interfere in our country's internal affairs and financial power. This is the first point. The nature of the loans should be used for production and construction and should absolutely not be allowed to be used to make up for the shortage of finances. This is the second point. Can the loans contain conditions of a political nature? This is the third point. If we can recognize the difference between production and non-production, and between political and non-political, and make a careful choice between the two, recognize that sovereignty is in our hands, and not be bound by the treaties of the creditor group, then there is no harm in borrowing foreign debt. Sir Otto Niemeyer is here this time with a plan for economic assistance to China. As Sir Otto Niemeyer arrives in Shanghai, we must seriously put it forward for the reference of those who are concerned about international loans to China.</p>

<p>Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange: Nine Issues Fell and Six Rose Last Week</p>
<p>Last week, from September 16th to 21st, the Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange was approaching the futures delivery for this month. There were no major changes in the market. Although swap transactions were said to be active, there were occasional conflicts, which were very minor. The reasons were: 1. Although there were many changes in the environment, the news was complex and unpredictable. 2. Although the number of accounts was still 20 to 30 million, most of them had been prepared for collection and payment, so the conflicts were less than in previous months. The main reason was that the most distant short sales had lowered the market price. Compared with the recent prices, the price difference was greater, so arbitrage transactions could not be swapped. The trading was quiet and the market was calm. However, there are many changes in the future, so it is still advisable to be cautious. The Italo-Ethiopian dispute is in a bad situation. At this critical moment, the fluctuations are large, and the long and short sides are very firm. The future will change with the changes in the environment. The rise in the "96" issue was due to the Japanese expressing to a British person the request to reorganize old debts, which was used by speculators. There are only two days left for the September futures. If there are no changes in the environment, it should remain stable and without major fluctuations. In the past week, the selling pressure was strong on Monday due to the sudden closure of the Hong Kong National Bank and Britain's involvement in the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, falling by one or two corners to five or six corners. On Tuesday, swap transactions were more common. The buyers, including issues 16, 33, and 47, etc., raised the market price by two or three corners to four corners. On Wednesday, swap transactions eased and the market was firm without much difference. The "96" issue suddenly fluctuated, rising by more than half a yuan. On Thursday, the "96" issue continued to cover short positions, rising by another half a yuan. The market price was slightly better by two or three corners due to the replenishment by the northern gangs. On Friday, rumors of contact in the Italo-Ethiopian dispute caused a sudden surge in selling pressure, falling by about three or four corners. On Saturday, the news was confusing and the market price was fluctuating. The long and short swap forces were evenly matched and the market price continued to be firm. The "96" issue also tended to be stable. As a result of the week's market price, the highs and lows were mixed, and the differences were mostly one or two corners. However, the 23rd issue fell by four and a half corners, while the "96" issue rose by eight corners, which was the most. The total transaction volume was 67.795 million yuan. The results of the rise and fall are compared and listed on the left. (Unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>
<p>American Stock Traders' Wills Were Undecided</p>

<p>October U.S. Cotton Longs Liquidated</p>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton opened, with each month falling by three to six points. The market conditions were active, and spot sales in the South increased, but cotton farmers were heavily selling套售on the weekend. Although the news from Liverpool was good and the war preparation situation in Italy was hot, they were both overturned by the Liverpool sales and the liquidation of the October contract. Traders were buying at a limited price, and the needs of brokers were also gradually developing. Buyers were still wary. The weather was good and spot sales were improving. In the end, mass selling still did not improve. It is estimated that spot prices fell by 15 points, and futures prices fell by six to eleven points. British cotton spot prices fell by six points, and futures prices rose by two or three points. Indian cotton European exporters both entered and exited the market. Futures traders slightly bought in, and sellers had limited volume. Later, it weakened slightly due to inter-market selling. It is estimated that平果爾 fell by one rupee,奧姆辣 fell by one rupee, and 白羅溪 fell by 1.625 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (Telegram on the 21st)</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for 23rd 白羅溪 flowers was 207 rupees and a half, an increase of 1.25杂比 compared with the previous day's close.</p>

<p>Since ancient times, the evaluation of people has paid great attention to "making a final conclusion after the coffin is closed." This naturally not only refers to the fact that a person's entire behavior can be settled when the coffin is closed, but also to allow his death to change some of people's prejudices against him. When we hear the news of a person's death, we often have a very clear intuition that accurately evaluates this person. Because at this time, we are not allowed to think carefully. In this moment, we try our best to forget all the behaviors that should be forgotten about this person, and the things that are worth remembering naturally invade our memory. This feeling may not last long, but after the passage of time, the memories left of this person are often these initial memories. Broadly speaking, the nature of history is almost the same. The task of historians is nothing more than to forget the behaviors of historical figures that should be forgotten and teach us to remember what should be remembered. Moreover, the power of historians in this regard is also extremely limited. They cannot express their own opinions in any way, but the times naturally produce such a result. The value of the records of contemporary historians in a certain era is often not as good as the works of later generations. The reason is that the works of later generations are closer to the result of time elimination.</p>
<p>Although people who have been determined to be "gentlemen" have always adhered to the legacy of concealing evil and promoting good. In fact, men of letters and scholars are very rich in arrogance. Lightness and frivolity are inherent habits. The reason why sages are sages still depends on their ability to criticize their contemporaries as worthless, so those who learn from sages and learn from sages can naturally do whatever they want. A person who has published a collection of novels often thinks about next year's Nobel Prize for Literature. A person who understands A+B imagines that next year's World Philosophical Conference will praise his thesis. A person who has participated in a tennis competition will elect himself as one of the top ten tennis players. Going further down, the mason Ah Si simply looks down on the engineers who built the twenty-four-story building. Professionals are rivals, and it has been a long time!</p>

<h3>Italy Rejects Five-Nation Proposal: Mediation Door Still Ajar</h3>
<p>Britain and France Eagerly Hope Italy Will Offer a Counterproposal to Serve as a New Basis for Negotiation</p>
<p>(Rome) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued a formal statement regarding Italy's rejection of the Five-Person Committee's proposal, stating that "the Cabinet's decision is not a complete rejection, and the door to other proposals remains open, whether within the scope of the League of Nations or not. Furthermore, Italian representative Aloisi has been specifically dispatched to the League of Nations for this matter." (National News Agency telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) League of Nations personnel believe that the subcommittee may request the Italian government to clarify the so-called minimum requirements mentioned in the Cabinet's communique, and that Italy should also submit a formal reply to the subcommittee, detailing its views, especially regarding the Abyssinian reform plan, and the extent to which it intends to participate. (Havas telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Italian Chief Delegate Aloisi yesterday delivered a copy of the communique issued by his Cabinet to the Chairman of the Five-Nation Subcommittee of the Administrative Council, namely Spanish representative Madariaga. This morning, he visited Madariaga again, offering supplementary explanations regarding the meaning of the communique, but without submitting any written documents. It is generally interpreted that Aloisi's actions can be seen as a formal action by the Italian government towards the subcommittee, implicitly acknowledging its authority to mediate the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. Following his meeting with Aloisi, Madariaga decided to convene a meeting of the subcommittee tomorrow to deliver a report. It is now heard that the committee will then discuss whether the demands made by the Italian government can be met. (Havas News Agency telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to well-informed sources, although Italy has rejected the proposals put forward by the Five-Nation Subcommittee, it has not rejected the possibility of negotiations. These negotiations must proceed on a fundamentally different basis, because the proposals put forward by the subcommittee failed to take into account the consequences contained in Italy's memorandum of the 4th of this month, as well as Italy's demands for the security of its African colonies. Therefore, a new basis should be sought and consultations should be carried out based on the following positive factors: (1) Abyssinian territory should be distinguished, that is, the distinction should be made between the mainland of the country and the conquered territories. At present, Italy's desires are limited to the second category of land. (2) Abyssinia should be disarmed. For this work to be effective, it must be completed under Italian supervision. (3) The granting of seaports to Abyssinia by other countries should be abandoned, because once Abyssinia obtains a seaport, disarmament will be impossible to achieve. Moreover, in 1931, Abyssinia proposed to Italy that it was willing to exchange the province of Wollega in Abyssinia for a seaport in Italian Eritrea. Italy rejected this proposal at the time. Therefore, granting a seaport to Abyssinia by other countries would be even more difficult to monitor than granting a seaport from Italian territory. (4) The Anglo-Franco-Italian Treaty of 1906 recognized Italy's right to expand its territory in Abyssinia. The Five-Nation Subcommittee seems to have ignored this point. Future negotiations should be based on this. (Havas telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Five-Nation Subcommittee of the Administrative Council of the League of Nations held a meeting at 6:30 p.m. to study the communique issued by the Italian Cabinet. It was decided to temporarily suspend work until the formal reply and opinions from the Italian government are received, before reconvening for discussion. According to our news agency's diplomatic correspondent, the British delegation believes that the communique issued by the Italian Cabinet deeply appreciates the spirit of the subcommittee's efforts to mediate, and has not resolutely rejected the proposals put forward by the committee. Therefore, the path to reconciliation has not been completely blocked, but it cannot be denied that there are still many obstacles to reaching a compromise. (Havas telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Rome) After the Italian government announced its rejection of the Five-Person Committee's proposal, it immediately expressed to the French Embassy that Italy's response might cause international unease, and hoped that French Prime Minister Laval would do his best to reduce this impact. (National News Agency telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Five-Person Committee today, in an atmosphere of disappointment, is reconsidering Italy's attitude in order to resolve the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. Since Italy rejected the committee's peace proposals, representatives of the League of Nations General Assembly have indicated that the committee will no longer attempt to put forward alternative proposals. However, an Italian representative stated that Mussolini's rejection has not completely closed the door to discussion, and alternative proposals can be made. The Five-Person Committee has now begun preparing a formal report to be submitted to the Administrative Council on Monday. After receiving the committee's report and Italy's rejection, the League of Nations General Assembly may formally recognize Italy as the aggressor in the East African dispute. A reporter from the Associated Press today read the original text of the proposals, which are divided into three parts. The first part is a general description of the opinions on the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. The second part is a proposal to assist Abyssinia in improving its police, economic, and financial organizations, and a suggestion that the League of Nations, on behalf of Abyssinia, select advisors. The third part states that since Abyssinia has granted various economic privileges to Italy, it should also obtain a seaport in exchange. (National News Agency telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The action of the Italian Cabinet in rejecting the Five-Person Special Committee's method of peacefully resolving the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, according to Italian Chief Delegate Aloisi's words to Special Committee Chairman Madariaga yesterday, should not be regarded as an absolute rejection. On this question, all sectors of the Italian community say that the intention of the Italian Cabinet in taking this action is only that the minimum basis for discussion put forward is unacceptable to the Italian government. The Roman communique contains the meaning that, if conditions are improved, Italy is willing to engage in negotiations. It also states that the communique does not reject a mediated resolution, and that the Italian Cabinet appreciates the efforts of the Special Committee. This is the first time that the continuation of the Committee's work has been recognized. On this point, it should be regarded as the Italian government's acknowledgment of the League of Nations' mediation. There will be no major new developments in the current situation. Although Aloisi has notified the Five-Person Special Committee of the Italian Cabinet's decision, he has not yet received instructions from Rome regarding everything mentioned in the communique. These instructions will not be transmitted before tonight. Before tonight, the Italian representative will not receive instructions from his government. Therefore, the Five-Person Special Committee, after a very brief meeting at 6:30 p.m. last night, cannot discuss the overall situation or make any decisions at this time, as the facts are not yet fully clear. It is expected that after Aloisi receives instructions from his government, he will continue to make inquiries of the government, so that the Five-Person Special Committee can ask the Italian government to clearly explain what conditions must be met to be considered a basis for negotiation. There is no doubt that the Special Committee will place the responsibility for proposing a plan on the Italian government. However, the Special Committee has decided to expedite everything as much as possible. Many small countries now feel that what the Special Committee is doing has gone far beyond what the situation allows. (Reuters telegram, 22nd)</p>
