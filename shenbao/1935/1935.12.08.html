<h3>美國之五年空軍計畫</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>自歐洲大戰結束。言國際政治及軍事者。競謂第二次世界大戰。其地點將在太平洋。其工具將為空軍。觀最近太平洋方面諸國關係之演化。益覺此語之信而有徵。際此日英美諸國之代表聚首英倫。討論裁减海軍之時。美國國會乃草擬五年空軍計畫。其內容每年建造軍用飛機八百架。並籌措經費。實現「韋爾柯克斯之大空防計書」。日本旣堅執海軍平等之要求。美國乃採取唯實主義態度以對付。所謂五年空軍計畫。非僅以空言恫言日本而已也。</p>
<p>夫太平洋不幸而有戰事。美國以海軍作戰。頗感地勢上之不利。戰爭之區域。必在西太平洋菲列賓羣島附近之海面。最有發生海軍戰之可能。美國艦隊。自舊金山及夏威夷前來。勞師襲遠。而日本艦隊則以逸待勞。證諸日俄戰爭俄國波羅的海艦隊失敗之前例則美國海軍當局不無戒心此其一自美國至東亞。沿途除檀香山外。無鉅大之海軍港。裝油修理。均感不便。南太平洋之撒摩亞島。雖有設備。亦甚簡陋。故一旦美國在此遼闊無涯而無歸宿之海面。與强敵作戰。必感困難。此其二。日本之加羅林羣島。橫列於太平洋之中途。形勢至險。潛艇衆多。利用海上之地勢。對於美國龐大之軍艦作神出鬼沒之暗襲可收成效。况日本於諸島之上已有佈置。此其三。</p>
<p>日美果有戰爭。美國利於取攻勢。在戰爭爆發之初。卽將日本之產業中心及政治中心破壞。使前綫士卒失後方之聯絡。無作戰之勇氣。為達到此目的。則海軍遠不及空軍美國空軍。技術上能力上。數量上質量上。均非日本之所能及。且美國之飛機工業。鋼鐵製造工業發達。財力豐裕。技術科學進步至速。其空軍之潛在力。數倍於日本。日本之都市。大率為板屋木舍所構成。易於燃燒。日本之軍艦其噸數較小。而鐵甲較薄。易於破壞空軍往返自如不。若海軍之需要大量之給養與龐大之根據地。自亞留仙羣島至日本本部。距離較短。飛機襲擊。奏效較易。此美國國防訐畫之所以注意空軍。而日本所以視此為腹心之患也。</p>
<p>曩者華盛頓會議以前。日本於東亞大陸恣意侵略。美國政府以非空言所能阻止。乃提出大海軍計畫。故華盛頓會議中日本得稍改變其態度。今倫敦海軍會議開幕矣。美國之五年空軍計畫。在外交上將收何等效果。實當前之有味問題也。</p>

<h3>海軍會議開幕前夕　五國政策比較　英海軍參謀接見日代表</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英國海軍總參謀長卻德斐上將、頃在海軍部接見海軍會議日本代表永野大將與前日本駐德大使永井、及日本代表團參議岩下寺畸等、有所會談當時並有英國海軍專家費涉爵士與外部美洲司長克萊奇等在座、聞英日兩國代表、曾討論海軍會議之程序問題、此項稈序問題、並將由海軍大臣孟塞爾於明日午後、接見美法意三國代表時、加以討論、又法國代表團人員、今晨曾在法國大使館舉行會議、由法國駐英大使、卽海會首席代表戈爾平主席、當將目前局勢、加以探討云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）倫敦海軍會議開會在卽、各國代表亦已相繼蒞止、茲將本社訪員所探悉之英日美法意五國主張、縷述如下、</p>
<p>（一）英國主張、係以對於各級軍艦分別規定質的限制為基礎、但如各國對於英國所提數字、不能同意、則亦不妨予以修改、（甲）對於各級軍艦之噸位、英國海軍部主張、主力艦噸位、當以二萬五千噸為限、但必要時、亦可依照美國建議、改以三萬五千噸為最高噸位、巡洋艦噸位、以七千噸為限、航空母艦以二萬二千噸為限、驅逐艦則以一千五百噸為限、同時並主張完全廢除潛水艇、（乙）關於各級軍艦之砲徑、英國主張主力艦砲徑、當以十二英寸為限、巡洋艦則以六英寸為限、</p>
<p>（二）日本主張廢除主方艦、或將主力艦之艦數與噸位、加以實質的减縮、此外並主張廢除一萬噸級巡洋艦、而將巡洋艦之噸位、予以减縮、則以日本對於主力艦與一萬噸級巡洋艦、均視為含有攻擊性之武器也、至於潛水艇艦隊、則日本認係防衛性之武器、向主張予以保留、</p>
<p>（三）美國則一反日本之主張、其素持之大艦巨砲主義、亟欲保持不墜、其於主力艦、主張最低應以三萬五千噸為限、於巡洋艦之噸位、則似不甚堅持、惟如以七千噸為限、則亦决不接受、至於日本之平等要求則斷不能為美國所容納、</p>
<p>（四）法國與意大利雖均準備接受限制之議、但兩國現已興工建造之三萬五千噸主力艦各兩艘、則均不願放棄、兩國並均主張、保持潛水艇、又聞意國代表團、現擬力避與法國發生爭議、至於地中海與直布羅陀海峽中立化之說、則已不擬提出要求、此外法國海軍部鑒於該國海外殖民地交通綫、比較綿長、故主張該國海軍力、應超過歐洲任何其他大陸國所置有之海軍、矧自英德海軍協定成立之後、德國之海軍力、將追隨英國之海軍政策、而依率增加、（百分之三十五）結果所屆、法國海軍力、自亦將隨之而增加、而德國則亦决追隨法國之建艦政策、卽使為三萬五千噸之主力艦、亦將同其步趨、此則因有英德海軍協定、而海軍會議所遴困難之所在也、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（東京）日政府决定軍縮會議對策、先行决定軍備縮减之方式、根據於此協議質的限制及其他附帶問題、於是訓令駐英代表在會議主張先議軍縮原則、據由藤井駐英代理大使來報、會議以各國全權組織委員會、以謀發見原則的諒解成立之端緒、故英美兩國是否同意尚屬疑問、或於會議初、日本與英美之間關於質的問題展開討論亦未可知、（七日日聯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）日本外務省發言人所稱、日太意欲廢棄與中國有關之九國公約、此間官方對之保守緘默、惟私人方面對於日方表示殊為　疑至於官方之不願有所表示、則以日本發言人係以私人資格談話、且曾謂日本目前對於此事不欲有何舉動云、負責方面則認此項聲明係一種試探、或對海軍會議之一種外交策略、（六日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）美國出席海軍會議代表團抵此後、昨晚卽在旅邸進餐、在海軍會議開幕之前、不擬與英國或他國任何海軍代表會晤、其首席代表諾曼台維斯、亦不擬在正式會議之前、對於未來討論情形、發表任何宣言云、該代表團現信會議期間、當必冗長、據此間美國人士觀察、海軍會議、結果未容十分樂觀、蓋前途障礙、大致有二、一則目前一般時局、對於會議之進程、足以發生不利影饗、二則各關係國對於主要海軍國噸位比例之原則、未見一致贊成、自將阻得海軍協定之成立云、（七日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）出席海軍會議之意國代表團人員畢尼海軍上將、皮西亞海軍少將、及各專家等一行、頃於午後五時二十分抵達此間、法國代表團特古海軍少將、德波爾幹上校、貝爾哥上尉及各專家等、亦與意國代表同車抵此、（六日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）倫敦海軍會議定於日內開幕、就哈瓦斯社訪員之觀察、目前海軍會議最大　關、乃在於美日兩國觀點之衝突、如日本代表堅持以海軍對等作為討論一切問題之先决條件、則恐海軍會議開會後、將立卽陷入僵局、至於英國方面、大約將力任和解、謀先將各項特殊技術問題、提出討論、俾海軍會議得按序進行、不至浪費時日、惟不論英國作如何努力、華盛頓海約廢止後所引起之各項主要問題、遲早必在海軍會議中提出、大約討論結果、必牽涉太平洋政治方面之問題、蓋美國欲在各遠東交通要道、建築新軍事根據地、而日本則必加以反對、故彼時海軍會議、勢必討論遠東策略上之列强均勢問題、固無疑也、（六日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>英美合辦　大西洋航空綫　五國會議決定惟須待二年</h3>

<p>阿京　阿京人民聞意飛機昨日轟擊台西不設防之鎭之消息後、大為憤懣、同時因阿王安然脫險，又大為歡　、聞阿王已命該城置高射砲防衛、意飛機昨共襲擊三次、計機九架、擲下烽裂與引火性之彈約千枚、共死三十二人、傷二百人、阿王曾親自瞞準發砲轟擊敵機、王當時立於御茹中、雖炸彈有在其近處炸裂者、而神色自若、一彈炸處、距身不足十五呎、傷兵數名、王則毫未受傷、中彈之美醫院、為美敎會所辦、受傷者中有挪威看護婦一、折一腿、敵機出現之前數分鐘、醫院中人卽逃匿一空、醫院之辦事處已被炸毁、病榻外科器用手術案及其他設備、均散播滿地、此外尚受其他損失、謠傳敵機一架曾被擊落、但未能徵實、阿京人士多覺戰事今已眞正開始、同時據未徵實之消息、瑪加爾附近杜洛境刻正在鏖戰中、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>（紐約）此間接阿京消息、意飛機昨日襲擊台西鎭、炸彈擊中美敎會所辦醫院一所、傷美籍看護一人、醫院全燬、藥品器械飛散四面、將使醫治傷兵極感困難、阿人因其廬舍被毁、咸咒罵白人不置、顯然不分意人與其他外人也、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>阿京　此間今日正式宣布、杜洛之南十五哩之處曾發生激戰、雙方損失甚重、今日意軍第二度轟炸剛達時、死婦女四人、孩童二人、阿俠魯將軍及伊曼魯將軍之部下、均受炸彈及機槍之射擊、意飛機復攻擊梅慶高及奧斯脫薩、意軍飛機今日飛過哈拉爾及安哥堡、但未擲彈、惟預測齊齊迦哈拉爾及阿京終將不免、聞意軍現正進攻太加齊、（六日國民社電）</p>
<p>阿京　意飛機今日復猛轟台西鎭、詳情未悉、聞阿國西北之貢達要城、亦為意飛機轟擊、死婦女兒童各四、另傷二十人、意機共擲下炸彈一百七十八枚、據台西美醫院醫士七人署名之正式報吿書稱、昨日意飛機十二架襲擊台西時、美醫院為其第一目的物、炸彈如雨而下、同時前東菲意軍總司令台波諾上將今日在羅馬公報中宣稱、意軍偵察機隊曾在台西附近一帶飛過武裝阿人之營帳數萬座、意飛機雖遭阿軍高射砲之猛轟、而以炸彈轟擊敵營、甚獲效果云、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）紀事報載稱、意飛機所擲炸彈、有一枚落於距離阿軍不足十五呎之處、而此項阿軍僅離阿皇六呎、阿皇當時曾以高射砲回擊、一聞轟炸機響聲、卽奔至高射砲處轟擊、兵士擬以布幕覆於皇肩、以避目標、但阿皇終置不顧、繼續在米凱爾司之旁、開放高射砲、（七日國民社電）</p>

<h3>千五百公里外　英法意間接談判　霍爾賴伐爾會於巴黎　墨索里尼向衆院宣言　意阿和議形勢又好轉</h3>
<p>（巴黎）英法意三國外長本日舉行談話、其中意國外長卽嚴索里尼首相、則距英法外長在一千五百公里外、此種長距離之間接談話方式、在外交史上實屬創舉、事綠英國外相霍爾今晨抵此後、當與賴伐爾總理約定於午後會晤、其時間當在意相墨索里尼在羅馬發表廣播演說終了之後、俾霍爾與賴伐爾得於會晤之前、詳稔墨索里尼演說之內容、而墨索里尼則先於今晨延見英國駐意大使德魯蒙爵士、有所商談、所謂英法意三角外交談話乃得在此種方式之下予以實現、知情達理本社訪員所知、本日英法意三國開始外交談話、其形勢已較日前時局黯淡一般人所預料者爲、蓋意國前曾表示、拒絕英法兩國從中調解這一切努力、並揚言意國雖可考慮他國提出建議、但意國自身則不願提出任何新建議云、當時外交界方面及意國與論方面卽盛傅歐洲戰禍卽將爆發之驚人消息、今則英法兩國對於必須由意國自動提出新建議一層、似已不加堅持、因而時局轉形緩和、而意國政府所持堅决態度、亦已不若前此所想像者之甚、此則不可謂非差強人意也、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）總理兼外長賴伐爾定於午後五時三十分、與英國外相霍爾會晤、據本社外交訪員所知、意國大使賽呂蒂今晨謁見賴伐爾時、會向賴伐爾再三申說禁運煤油一事之嚴重性、此在法國外交部、則以為惟有意國改取妥恊態度、力圖和平、則禁運煤油一事、方可延緩實行、但據本社訪員探悉、霍爾與賴伐爾鑒於意國意願、極難捉摸、故對於解决意阿爭竭之英法共同計劃、或將從緩决定、亦未可知云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英外相霍爾今日在巴黎與法總理賴伐爾會談時、英外次樊西太特亦將列席、彼已抵巴黎、昨離倫敦前、曾與法意大使接談、聞英法專家雖尚未完成其和平建議、但明日將以彼等討論之結果報吿霍爾與賴伐爾、現望兩要員能因此商妥切實方案、提交意阿兩國、進目前尚無徵象可信意政府準備依英法政府所能視為適當之條件開始談判、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）墨索里尼决定今日下午三時向衆院演講、並將譯成十七國文字、廣播全世界、意國人民現正靜候首相宣布對阿戰事及國聯制裁之態度、墨氏演詞內容聞係剛柔並用、（七日國民電）</p>
<h3>意衆院秋會開幕　墨索里尼演說　謂大局稍進步</h3>
<p>（羅馬）衆院於今日午後舉行秋季會議、墨索里尼蒞院行開幕禮時、曾發言譏刺法國參加對意制裁、開慕前、全院高唱愛國歌、二時、墨氏入院、衆皆起立向之歡呼、出席議員共四百餘人、皆衣黑制服、缺席者、僅服從東菲之四十三人、墨氏發言述及制裁、謂大局今已微有進步所提議之制裁、或將稍為緩和、惟諸議員未可過於樂觀、意政府前曾被請發表不可更變的需要、乃於十月間以此通吿法政府、不意各國並不提出建議、而以制裁為報、墨氏繼述及英法專家在巴黎之談話、謂今無理由可以為彼等將獲迅速之决議云、於是由議長齊亞諸伯爵宣布在開會、並致詞謂凡屬意民、皆抱抗拒不公允的制裁之决心、故今皆以所有黃金貢獻國家、諸議員亦願交出其所有之金獎章、齊氏繼請諸議員注意墨索里尼已將其所有之獎章除「進取羅馬」所獲之一枚外、全行交出、禺氏並交出其鋼盔、以改煉純鋼、於是諸議員步至投票案、各將獎章投入一匭、法美大使皆坐於外交席、惟英大使未見蒞臨、當開幕前之數小時、旁聽席已告人滿、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）意國衆議院於本日午後開會、首相墨索里尼於三時入塲、全體議員均衣黑衫、向首相鼓掌歡呼、演說壇上遍書標語、上列參加制裁各國之國名、當卽由墨索里尼發表演說、略謂國際局勢殊鮮改善之望、意國人民幸弗過分樂觀、至於英法專家雖在巴黎舉行談話、但並非正式談判云、墨索里尼繼復表示反對制裁、並謂英國外相霍爾在下院所作演說、中謂「英國深願意國有一强有方之政府」、然意國勵精圖治、以謀造成强有力之政府、固已十有四載矣云、意相演晚之最後結論、則謂「余茲切實聲明、苟意國權利未獲承認、意國在菲洲之利益、未獲保障、則無復眞正之是非曲直可言、意國一方面理直氣壯、一方面仍當在意國及菲洲繼續行動、意國陸軍及黑衫隊、在菲洲遠征、必能為祖國爭取勝利、固毫無疑義也」云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>墨索里尼　延見英法大使　賴伐爾亦接見各國代表</h3>
<p>（羅馬）英國駐意大使德魯蒙今日謁見意相墨索里尼、談半小時、衆言其所討論、集中於今日法總理賴伐爾與英外相霍爾之會議、墨氏因此談話之結果、或將改變其今日午後在衆義院中之言論、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）意相墨索里尼、今晨曾延見英國大使德魯蒙爵士與法國大使　尙伯蘭、一般人以為當時曾就英國外相霍爾與法國總理兼外長賴伐爾午後在巴黎所舉行之談話、加以討論、並曾涉及意相本人在衆議院所擬發表之演說云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據消息靈通人士宣稱、英國駐意大使德魯蒙、於今晨拜訪意相墨索里尼、目的乃在向意相面遞本月五日外相霍爾在下院發表演說之全文、並向意國再度作和平之籲請、德魯蒙訪問意相之結果、頃尚未通知倫敦方面、惟聞已立卽通知巴黎方面、俾令霍爾在會晤法國總理兼外長賴伐爾以前、可詳悉其內容云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）法國總理兼外長賴伐爾、今晨分別接見各國外交代表、計有意國駐法大使賽呂蒂、阿比西尼亞國代表席士敎授、美國大使史脫洛斯、南斯拉夫公使布利區、加拿大公使杜朗、智利出席國聯會代表伊古那等數人、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英擬在地中海　增海軍根據地　馬爾泰易受空軍威脅</h3>
<p>（倫敦）此間今日得悉、法國已於外交方面通知英政府、謂意相墨索里尼業已拒絕英法之和平建議、英外相霍爾與法總理賴伐爾在巴黎晤談之性質勢將因此大變、霍爾或將傾其全力鞏固英法共同陣綫、以資應付歐洲愈趨嚴重之時局、並將力勸賴伐爾充份合作、實行對意制裁、此間外交家今日宣稱、東菲戰事有繼續之勢、而國聯制裁亦必强化、今日謠專墨索里尼將與實施制裁各國斷絕邦交、以答復油禁、英國現正進行秘密談判、希望擴大其地中海之根據地云（六日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今日自可靠方面得悉、南斯拉夫保羅親王十一月間訪問倫敦時、曾討論英國在南斯拉夫海岸建築海軍根據地之事、英國現並希望在西班牙之巴利列克島進行同樣防務、並擬輔助希臘開闢那伐立拿及其他軍港、海軍部認馬爾泰島處境過於危險、不足為海軍活動之根據地、蓋自意國飛抵該地、僅須半小時耳、（七日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據倫敦羅馬巴黎三處之推測、今日午後意相羅索里尼所發之言論、將阻碍最近和議之進行、倫敦每日郵報今日社論謂墨氏已有此舉動、渠已對法總理賴伐爾聲明渠必反對以十地讓與阿國、渠不願考慮涉及對阿交涉之談判云、聞墨氏將於賴伐爾與郝爾會晤以前聲明意國將與贊成油禁之國斷絕外交關係、同時此間接到阿國戰地訪電、意軍昨日轟炸台西與貢達之行為、已使阿人情感愈臻强硬、報仇之念愈切、德國戈林將軍昨晚發言願上帝勿使目前緊張時局終釀成歐洲風潮、並謂戰禍蔓延之可能性、使德人不能不有所準備云、約克大敎主丹浦爾博士昨抵紐約時、言及國際形勢、謂世界或須又有一次惡戰、以植立國聯之權威云、觀此言論、可見一般人之惶慮、（七日路透電）</p>

<h3>鐘錶的臉　（下）</h3>
<p>— 丰子愷</p>
<p>度現在生活的人，對於鐘錶的臉，看的回數，恐怕比看上司，老闆，好友，愛人的臉的回數更多吧！學生，先生，工人，店員，郵局裏的人，車站裏的人……誰不每天看好幾次鐘錶的臉呢？就是深居簡出，養尊處優，尊榮富貴，而天天要別人伺候他的臉色的人，自己也不得不常看鐘錶的臉色呢。希望這個衆目每天常看的臉的相貌，變得好看些，原是有理的要求。記得我們初見牠時，牠的臉上劃着細緻的羅馬字，那幅射形的許多綫條，圖案的意味與數字的意味相半。雖然繁瑣，却也溫文爾雅，頗有古風。我也記不得牠是甚麼世紀在西洋出世的，但知道牠在明朝萬暦年間（十六世紀末）就由利瑪竇帶進中國來，想來總是十六世紀或以前的產物。羅馬字大約就是原來的相貌吧？因為那細緻的幅射形，溫雅的圖案風，可以使我聯想起文藝復興期時代及宮廷藝術時代的美術形式來。約三十年前，當我們小時候，牠的臉上還劃着羅馬字；後來忽然變容，大大小小的鐘錶，臉上都註着阿刺伯字了。此風始於何時，創於何國何人，我非工藝美術的考據家，不得而知。但可想像這是十九世紀末「實利主義」時代的現狀，一主智主義」在工藝美術上的表示。因為用12345等以長方為基本形式而筆劃繁簡不等的阿刺伯字來裝在一個圓圈內的四周，而且還要叫牠們個個向着我，在實利上，在智的感覺上，雖有便利之處，但是在形式上終免不了「繫柄」之憾。尤其是現在流行的女子用的長方形手錶：因為要硬把長方形的四邊去凑指針的圓運動，以致各阿刺伯字的大小和距離都參差起來，變成了一副尷尬臉孔。現在回想，當年我的討嫌鐘錶的臉而給牠們塗煞，雖是好奇之舉，恐怕一半也是牠門那副尷尬臉孔所使然。</p>
<p>註阿刺伯字的鐘錶裝尷尬臉孔給世人看，至今已有數十年了。世間一定有敏感的工藝美術家討嫌牠，所以有那種新藝術風的時鐘的出現。「單純明快」，是現代感覺所要求的美術形式。雕龍刻鳳的家具，現在已被玻璃桌子和鋼管椅子所代替了。富麗堂皇的宮殿，現在已被玻璃房子，摩天樓，汽船式建築所代替了。萬般工藝美術，都跟了這潮流而趨向「單純明快」，這時鐘可說是其先鋒之一。講到牠的好處，第一：鐘錶沿用已久，牠的臉上的部位我們都已看得熟而又熟。故僅用一劃表示鐘點，而不註數目字，是有利於形式，而無礙於實用的。第二：用一劃表示鐘點，因其所佔地位狹小，而且個個同樣，故每五分鐘之間的距雕很淸楚，比羅馬字的淸楚，比阿刺伯字的淸楚得多。我們看分數，一眼就可看得正確。第三：指針上免除裝飾紋樣，（舊式的鐘錶的指針，兩旁由曲綫包成，針頭上有圓圈，有時圓圈下還裝着如意形的鬚。）其指示的態度直截，痛快，坦白，明瞭，不如舊式指針的嚕哩嚕囌。—在這三點上，我讚美新式鐘錶的臉。但我不能斷定這是量進步最合理的鐘錶形式；只覺得比註阿刺伯字的好看。我也不能斷定這張臉可以討一切人的歡喜；只覺得至少牠對於一部分人的視覺是能給予慰安的。我說「一切人」，實在太疎慮了！在我國的內地，廣袤的窮鄉僻處，還有無數人不曾見過鐘錶的面呢！　十二月三日夜</p>

<h3>我國的科學研究事業（續）</h3>
<p>（十一月二十六日對全國中等學校學生演講）</p>
<p>中央研究院總幹事丁文江（十一月二十六日對全國中等學校學生演講）</p>
<p>我今天所要講的是我國科學事業的聯絡與合作。但是我先要說明中央研究院的歷史與任務。</p>
<p>中央研究院是民國寸七年四月成立的。照他組織法，他是中華民國最高學術研究機關，直接隸屬於國民政府。他的任務，一是實行科學研究，一一是指導聯絡獎勵學術的研究。為實行弟一種任務，中央研究院共設立了十個研究所。物理，化學，工程三個所因為要同國內外工業機關聯絡，所以設在上海。此外天文，氣象，地質，動植物，心理，歷史語言，社會科學與管理行政的總機關都集中在南京。由此看起來，中央研究院研究的範圍是極其廣汎的，一方面包括自然科學的大部份，一方面包括社會科學與歷史語言。要了解他研究的內容，我們可以把他的任務分析為三種。</p>
<p>第一是許多有常軌的任務RoutineServtce如天文研究所的推算暦本，觀察變星，數日中黑子；氣象研究所的觀察溫度，氣壓，風同，報告天氣，顯然是屬於這一類的。不但如此，就是化學的普通分析，工程的標準試騐，物理的地磁測量，地質的測繪地質圖，動植物的採集標本，都可以算是一種有常軌的任務。嚴格講起來，這不能算是研究Reseurch但楚這是許多研究工作的基本，而且往往要經過長期的時間，纔可以得到結果，譬如工程師要建築橋樑，防止水患，農林家　改良　產，提倡森林，都要知道許多年這些地方的平均的雨量。這種工作，在任何國家，都是由政府的接担任的，担任這種任務的機關，往往是獨立的。在中國却偶然的容納在個總機關—中央研究院——之下。這當然可以有很明顯的好處，因為在一個機關之下，比較的容易使得作這種工作的人互相聯絡，互相援助，一切工作合一化，合作化，以最少數的經費，來作最在量的任務。</p>
<p>中央研究院最重要最有實用的任務，是利用科學方法夾研究我國的原料和生產。在我們工業落後的國家，要自己有新異的發明，是很不容易的。然而我們有我們特殊的天產，傳統的技能。假如我們能了解我們原料的質量，生產的原理，很容易利用新方法來改良舊的工業，或是開發新的富源。譬如礦產，用地質學的方法來發現新礦，我上次講演已經提到實業部地質調查所的成績了。現在我要就中央研究院地質研究所的成績來舉一個例。</p>
<p>浙江平陽礬山舖地方，向來是出明礬的。五年前中央研究院研究員葉良輔先生去調查，方纔知道這是世界上第一個大的礬礦。他的儲量，將近三萬萬噸。礬礦Alunitemued原來是一種硫酸鉀鋁。我們現在用土法把他做成明礬Alum價值很少，而且銷路很窄。每年出產不過值六十多萬元，假如我們能把原來的礬礦一方面製造成氣化鋁，作為煉鋁的原料；一方面製造成硫酸鉀，或是利用一部份的硫酸，製造硫酸錏；所得到的結果，就從用途很有限的明礬，變為幾種銷路極大的必需品。每年生產的能力，一定可以增加幾十倍。目前這一個問題中央研究院化學研究所和塘沽的化學工業社都正在着手研究。因為技術上還有困難，所以還沒有到眞正成功的地步。但是知道礬山舖的礦量如此之大，就是這種研究的發動點。因為礬礦當然外國也是有的，不過礦量都比較的很小，所以不值得注意，不值得研究新法子利用他製造鋁或是肥料。我們旣然知道這種礬礦是找們很大的富源，當然不肯輕易放進，僅僅把他作為製造明礬的原料了。</p>
<p>大家都知道瓷器是我們老祖宗所發明的。而近年以來，我們的瓷器業，慢慢的衰落，不能與日本的瓷器競爭。最重要的原因祇不外乎兩種：第一我們製造瓷器的工人，祇知道遵照歷代相傳的方法來做坯作釉，燒窑。對於一切作用，但知其然而不知其所以然。譬如為甚麼綠故表面上一樣的陶土，在景德鎭可以做白瓷，在宜興祗能作紫沙？你要間燒瓷的工人，他說不出原故來的。所以不但不能進步改良，而且因為原料質量的變遷，出產品反退化起來。第二因為是外國的瓷器是用機器作的，質量都有一定的標準。我們是完全用手工，質量不能一定。諸位祗要到瓷器店裏看看江西出的碗，同一個窑的出品，大小形式都不能一樣，就知道新舊式工業的優劣，和我們應該努力的途徑了。中央研究院在工程研究所裏附設了一個陶瓷試騐塲。先與地質研究所合作，把江蘇浙江福建江西湖南各處的陶土釉料，澈底研究他們地質上的成因儲量，用標準的方法，採取礦樣來分析試騐，使各種的原料，都可以標準化（Standardization）然後選礦量最豐富，礦質最適用的原料，用小規模的機械，試騐製造陶器。這種工作，開始還不很久，但是我相信短期裏總可以有相當的結果，可以作我門陶業復興的基礎。</p>
<p>還有許多農工業上常用的方法，在外國可能，在中國不可能。要想模仿人家，必須要了解中國的環境，重新自己研究。醫如棉花有幾種重要的病害，做炭疽病，角斑病，苗萎病和立枯病。這都是因為細菌妨害棉子的綠故。這種細菌，一部份附生於棉子的壳上，一部份藏在土壤裏面。在外國都是在播種的時候，一面把棉子用藥品消毒，一面把毒藥撒在土壤裏面。在中國這種方法，都不能採用。一來因為藥品要向外國購買，價錢太貴，二來因為我們的農民太窮，化不起這種消毒的資本。而這種病害，在我國極其流行。受了這種病的棉花，或是發黑生斑，或是枯萎，每年損失很大。最近中央研究院動植物研究所鄧叔羣先生研究這個問題，得到了解决的方法了。他試騐的結果，如果在播種以前，先把棉子放在滾水裏面浸過，棉子壳上所附生的毒菌，都可以殺死。棉子壳子很厚，在滾水裏浸過，不但無害而且可以　他早點發芽。再用氯化汞和草灰塗在棉子上面，然　播歡，上面所說的病害，完全可以消除。氯化汞是一種毒藥，可以消滅十壤裏的病菌。因為不撒在土裏面而用草灰相和，殺菌的效用相同而所需要的數量較少。而且我國農民的習慣都先用草灰拌子而後播種，所以如比辦法並不多費人工。滾水是不用費多少錢的，據鄧先生計算，用他的方法，每一畝地所用的棉子，祇要用一兩氯化汞，就可以發生效力。一兩氯化汞照市價纔不過一角多錢，比外國所用的舊法子經濟得多了。如果我們的農民能夠利用這種方法來種棉花，每一畝祇要化極少數的錢，就能完全防止四種病害，減少的損失，至少比消毒所費的錢要多十倍。</p>
<p>麻黃原是中國的舊藥，但是用法極不科學。自從陳克恢先生在協和醫學校研究證明麻黃裏所含的精Ephedrine是治喘病的特效藥，麻黃的眞正作用方　明瞭。所以現在北平研究院特設了一個藥物研究所，請趙石民先生研究中國藥村，中央研究院的化學研究所，也有人和趙先生合作做這種工作。但是比藥物尤其重要的是我們的食品問題。誰都知道中國勞工的效能極低，比不上歐美人的一半。譬如中國的礦工，一偭人工作十二小時，平均祇能挖煤半噸。英國的礦工，在差不多同樣的情形之下，工作八小時，能挖煤一·二噸。可是歐戰的時候，中國這咱礦工，被英國人運到法國云挖戰壕。吃的麵包牛肉，工作的效能並不在西歐人之下。勞動階級的工人如此，小資產階級的學生也是如此。凡是檢查過中國學生身體的人，都知道中國的學生，體格發育，大都不能健全。其原因都是因為所吃的東西，不夠營養我們不能希望個個人都能吃肉，但是希望學化學的人，研究我們通常的食品，決定他們的營養價值，使得我們能用科學的根據，來重新分配我們的食品，據淸華大學教授　本　先生的研究，北平的大　　所含的生活素，與美國橙子一樣。堤然如此，不但窮人應該多吃　　，有錢的人也可以少買一點美國橙子。中央研究院化學研究所上着手研究這一種問題。如果能在我國國民經濟能力範圍之內，改良我們的食品，一般國民的工作效能，一定可以增加了許多。</p>

<h3>蘇敎廳與滬銀行界　訂立敎育借欵</h3>
<p>總額二十一萬元月息九厘　由吳縣營業稅牙稅作擔保</p>
<p>江蘇省政府敎育廳頃因遷建省立南京中學、特向滬銀行界洽商借欵二十一萬元、已於昨日付欵、茲將各情分誌如下、</p>
<p>借欵用途　蘇省府敎育廳以在本省所設之中學頗多、而以在首都之南京中學規模最大、然在鎭江省會反無完備之中學、該廳以首都邇來中學林立、已可容納負笈學子、並無設立之必要、而在省會方面、極少完備中學、一般居民每遺其子弟赴外埠求學、因之遂有將首都之省立南京中學遷至鎮江省會之决定、特向滬銀界商借二十一萬元、充校舍建築經費、</p>
<p>接洽成功　蘇省敎育廳長中委周佛海氏、於上月間來滬向滬銀行界接洽借欵、承借之銀行中央、中國、交通、金城、中南、江蘇、江蘇農民等七家、經雙方數度會商、因數目不鉅、故進行頗為順利、業於上月底正式訂簽合同、由每家銀行借洋三萬、合成廿一萬、月息九厘、周氏旋即離滬返省、刻中中交等銀行、已於昨日電令鎭江分行就地劃付云、</p>
<p>一年還清　此項借欵、共分一年還淸、由蘇敎廳以吳縣之營業稅與牙稅作為第一擔保、而以首都南京中學之舊地房產、作為第二擔保、至於在鎭之新校舍、已由敎廳設計打樣、招標承築、預計於一年內可以落成、屆時即可遷入云</p>

<h3>今日國立音專　新校舍落成禮</h3>
<p>本埠國立音樂專科學校、自民十六年開辦迄今已歷八載、今春始在市中心區市政府後面市京路購定基地、與工建築、現已竣工、訂於今日（星期日）下午二時、舉行落成典禮、並舉行八週紀念學生音樂會、因該校大禮堂以經費所限、尚未動工、今日將在小禮堂開會、來賓須憑柬入座、以資限制、</p>
<p>本校校舍建議計劃　（蕭友梅）</p>
<p>（二）建築費　民國十六年十月向大學院蔡院長提出音樂院鐊辦計劃時、國民政府成立未久、敎育經費尚未有把握、還談不到校舍建築、當時難蒙大學院批准籌備、除發給開辦費二千六百元外、對於設備費與校址、政府祗允於內戰結束後籌劃發給、七六年以後至二十四年七月、本校校舍均係租用法租界民房、並且由十七年到二十年之間、遷移了四次、我們覺得租用住宅、辦音樂專門學校絕對不適宜、故歷年向政府提出新預算、均有要求發給地址及建築費、一直到民國二十三年始核准我們請求的四十萬元的五分一（即八萬元）、因為這區區八萬元不足建築正校舍之用、故二十三年度提出預算請求增加、結果核准增撥四萬元、但截至本年十一月祗領到二萬元耳、</p>
<p>（二）　校址之選定　在民國二十二年以前、本校校務會議曾有在本市兆豐公園附近購置本校基地之議决案、後因該處地價太昂、無力購得、後經第五十二次校務會議將該議案推翻、决定在市中心區領地建築、因為市中心區自從市政府及各局遷往之後、並且有圖書館博物館運動塲市醫院等偉大建築、大家承認該區是上海市的文化區、故最近本校校務會議推翻舊案、不獨本校同人無異議、目深得敎育部及市政府的贊同、本校原擬領地三十畝、後因一時不能將地價付淸、乃在市京路底（市政府後面）暫領十六畝、先付地價四分之一、餘數分三年付淸、該處本無馬路、自本校付地價後、市政府即飭工務局特別為之開闢新路（即市京路東段）、又飭閘北水電公司安置水管及電杆、故本校校舍動工未久即有水電、祗這一點本校對市政府的協助極表示感謝、</p>
<p>（三）第一步建築計劃　本校建築分兩步進行、委任建築師羅邦傑先生設計及監工、第一步建築計劃估價約如下表、（一）基地約十六畝、約三九·二九〇·〇〇元、（二）正校舍一座、（大禮堂除外）連同煖汽管衛生器具電燈工程校路陰溝約八七·一九二·六九元、（三）練習室兩座、（每座十七間房）連電燈工程、約一五·九〇〇·〇〇、（四）男女生宿舍各一座連衛生器具電燈工程約三五·六〇〇·〇〇、（五）南面圍牆、一·九八五·八五、（六）廚房一座、八〇〇·〇〇、（七）建築師打樣監工費（按4％計算、約五·六五八·四六、（八）塡土工程、約五·〇〇〇·〇〇、（九）東西北三面水泥柱竹籬、約三·五七三·〇〇、（十）鋪草種樹、約五·〇〇〇·〇〇、以上合共約需二〇〇·〇〇〇·元以上第一步計劃本來不能算是很大、但是單靠領到之十萬元、無論如何不能全部實現的、幸而得四川楊森師長捐助本校基地費一萬元、本校地皮費得以付了四分之一、又本校歷年撙節積存之欵連同零星捐欵足建築一座練習室之用、故本期建築工程祇能將正校舍一座、練習室兩座、圍牆廚房四項完全完工、女宿舍雖已動工、但如無欵接濟、尚無把握可以完成、其他如建築師報酬、塡土工程、竹籬等項祗能付一部分、至於男宿舍直無法動工、鋪草種樹更談不到、總之、欲完成本校第一步建築計劃（連地價）、尚須六萬餘元、吾人固盼政府於最近期內再增發一音專新校舍正面圖部分、尤盼社會人七慷慨捐助也、關於音樂學校校舍建築最重要是一防音裝置（Soundproof）、本校正校會原來計劃、用正式三層水泥鋼骨建造、後因需欵較鉅、非有十四五萬元辦不到、乃改為假三層、故第二層與　三層之間不能絕對防音、第一第二層之課室、亦祇可用較廉的防音設備、因為經濟所限也、</p>
<p>（四）第二步建築計劃　至於本校第二步建築計　、包含列各項、（一）基地十四畝（在本校後面購領）、（二）大禮堂一座、（三）第二男女宿舍各一座、（四）練習室兩座、（五）圖書館一座、（六）體育館一座、（七）敎職員宿舍一座、（八）校長及主任住宅四座、（九）建築師打樣監工費、（十）塡土校路陰溝及鋪草種樹、（十一）竹籬、以上各項估價、是否二十萬元可以辦到、尚在未知之列、但吾人不能不有整個計劃、如經濟上不許可同時實現、祇好分步進行、深望校內校外愛樂人士努力帮助、務使本校建築計劃早日完成、樂敎得以復興、於吾國文化前途自有不小的影響罷、</p>
<p>校史　輔叔</p>
<p>吾國音樂教育素不受特殊之注重、最高限度音樂一系亦僅為各校之附庸、吾國音樂專門學校之設立蓋自本校始也、筆者之作此言、毫不敢借以自大、更不敢以此自滿、惟締造之艱難、有足述者、故草茲簡史以吿國人、民國十六年暑假前吾國音樂敎育所託命之北大附設音樂傳習所及藝專之音樂系、隨合併國立九校之議而咸有被摧殘之勢、幸我國民政府成立於南京、仰賴當局之賢明、蕭友梅先生提出之國立音樂院創辦計劃、得以通過、而總籌備之工作者即為蕭先生惟當時政府方致力於北伐、國庫頗形支絀、僅以籌備費二千六百元應付一切設備及房金、幾經困苦始賃校舍於陶爾斐斯路、定名為國立音樂院、以大學院院長蔡孑民先生兼任院長、於十一月初旬招生、同月二十七日行開學禮、至是中國曠古所無之音樂院遂獲正式成立、惟以招生太遲、故初次取錄者僅二十二人、是年十二月蔡院長以大學院事務紛繁、無暇兼顧、特委託本院敎務主任蕭友梅先生代理院務、</p>
<p>民國十七年二月、添招新生、新舊合計約五十六人、遂遷至霞飛路、並增設宿舍、同年六月、提出十七年度新預算算、經大學院核准、從九月起每月經費增至五千元、學額亦增至八十名、是年八月本校再遷至畢勛路、並賃屋於辣斐德路桃源邨、是為本校之第三次遷居、九月、大學院聘任蕭先生為本院院長、</p>
<p>民國十八年七月、國民政府修正大學組織法以，該組織法內無音樂藝術兩院之規定、乃令改組杭州藝術院為藝術專科學校、本院為音樂專科學校、蕭先生因向敎育部辭去院長職務、至八月、敎育部復聘蕭先生為本校校長、以至於今、音樂院初設預科、專修科選科及特別選科、預科為選科之預備、須修足六十學分、始可畢業、專修科目的在養成昔樂師資、須修足一百學分、選科為專攻一門者而設、分初中高三級、每級以修足一十學分為標準、特別選科則為有志研究音樂而為定章所限、或額滿見遺、不獲揷入各科班者而設、敎員所收學費各班不同、唯選習科目概隨他班上課、故程度亦與選科無異、逮十八年八月改組之後、奉敎育部令改專修科為師範科、同年八月聘沈仲俊先生為事務主任、十月、聘胡周淑安先生為聲樂系主任、查哈羅夫先生（Mr．B．ZakharoffGodowsky之弟子、俄國籍）為鋼琴系主任、法利國先生（Mr．A．Foa意國籍）為小提琴系主任、聲樂鋼琴小提琴三系於以正式成立、同時又聘耶魯大學音樂學士黃自先生為理論敎員、校務為之一振、十二月、本校與上海商務印書館簽訂印行本校叢書及樂藝季刊之契約、</p>
<p>十九年二月、本校成立大提琴系、聘佘甫磋夫（Mr．Shevtzpff俄國籍）為大提琴系主任、當時以本校學生進步極速、乃增設研究科、後於五月奉敎育部令改稱研究班、先是本校學生人數不多、敎務較簡、故敎務主任一職由蕭校長兼任、自是年八月起、改聘黃自先生為敎務主任以專責成、是九月理論作曲系成立、蕭校長兼任該茶主任、樂藝季刊聘請廖靑主先生主編、於是年四月出版第一期、本校叢書亦陸續出版、本校事務已入正軌、而畢觔路校舍又於二十年八月為業主收回、本校遂再遷至辣斐德路、校址之變易、此為第四次、是年十月、復奉敎育部令改預科為高中班、師範科改為高中師範科、均收受高中畢業生、本科各系改為組、另在本科添設師範組、高中師範科畢業者、如欲繼續肄業即可升入、但其修了學分數定為四十個、其餘本科之理論作曲·鋼琴·小提琴·大提琴·聲樂·國樂各組、則須修足八十學分、方可畢業、是年十月又設補習班、收錄初學音樂者、由師範生敎授以資實習、是年本校叢書已有六種出版、一二八戰起、本校叢書和聲學及樂藝季刋第七期稿件、均隨商務印書館分受砲火之毀滅、本校之出版計劃、不得不暫吿停頓、同時以欠發經費已達四個月、乃經校務會議議决從二月起停辦宿舍、此後本校於風雨飄搖中勉力支持、迨二十二年大局稍定、本校叢書乃繼續在商務印書館出版、截至現在已出版者、計十九種、在印刷中者尚有六種、同年本校員生鑑於結社之必要、因重新組織昔樂藝文社、請蔡孑民葉遐庵兩先生為社長、成立之後、第一步計劃為出版音樂雜誌、幾經波折、始於民國二十三年在良友公司出版、</p>
<p>二十三年七月、事務主任沈仲俊先生因事辭職、由陳能方先生繼任、自是本校以一切校務均有發展、遂力圖校舍之建築、本校請求撥發之臨時費經中政會核定為八萬元、本校乃以是項經費及歷年募捐所得之一萬二千餘元、於今年春間在上海市中心區市京路購地十六畝建築校舍、惟終為經費所限、現在建築完成者僅有正校舍、西練琴室東練習室及女生宿舍尚在建築中、（在宿舍未築成之前、本年暫在市中心市林路郵亭里租賃郵局建築住宅六所、為男女生宿舍之用）、其他如男生宿舍圖書館體育館等之建築費、尚待籌募、</p>
<p>今年秋季開學本校以新生命開始、因重訂本校組織大綱及學則、鋼琴組包括風琴改為有鍵樂器組、合併小提琴組及大提琴組為樂隊樂器組、法利國先生為該組主任、同時訓育處正式成立、（以前由訓育委員會辦理訓育事務）聘黃國良先生兼代訓育主任、並添聘李惟寗吳伯超蕭淑嫻三先生為本校敎員、三先生均為留學歐洲、載譽歸來者、又謀音樂敎育普及起見、本學年向各省區招生、結果由各省敎廳保送來考者有十五省區之多、向來無人來學之甘肅、陝西二省、亦居然派人來考、此後音樂師資當有逐漸普及之希望至教授方面、實行固定音名唱法、初級之聲樂及鋼琴、實行全班教授、則屬於新試騐者也學校招生、本應中外兼收、本校亦經奉敎育部令寬大錄取、故二十一年二月、外籍學生投考者幾及二十人之多、惟本校究以學額有限、不能多收、嗣經校務會議議决暫定外籍學生學額以全體學額十分之一為度、本年又改為每組以二人為限、而額滿見遺者頗不乏人、本校之受中外人士之重視、可見一斑矣、</p>
<p>至於本校學生之正式畢業者雖不甚多、（計本科三人·本科師範組七人·高中師範科二人·選科二人·）然畢業後莫不有相當的職務、加以國內音樂人才缺乏、故往往有肄業本校二三年不待畢業即已他去就職、現在本校肄業一百三十七人之中、已有二三十人在校外擔任工作、（或在本埠大學專科學校、及中小學担任教職。或爲影　片公司作譜、或為家庭敎師、）可見音樂人才、求過於供、致使多數學生不待畢業遂離校就事、亦即目前學音樂者不患無出路之明證也、</p>

<h3>昨江大足球賽　曁南光華和局　零比零各無所獲　十二碼曁南失的</h3>
<p>江大足球賽、本屆加入者祗曁南復旦光華三隊、昨日下午二時半、曁南與光華在大西路光華球塲作首次比賽、結果零比零、各無所獲、光華始終屈居下風、其能不敗者乃幸運耳、入後雙方踢得火起、舉動有失檢處、似非殺高學府中人所宜有之惡習、且一般在旁參觀之學生、更不宜有噓噓喊打之聲、盼此後稍加注意、茲將比賽情形誌次、</p>
<p>比方混戰</p>
<p>裁判員沈回春、鳴金開戰、光華首先開球、不一分鐘、曁南犯規、被踢任意球、中途截獲、大舉進攻、一搭一擋、聲勢浩浩、光華內衛堅强、獲得來球、傳與左鋒、遂復興師節節進攻、雙方混戰多時、各無所獲、冬雨之後、塲地稍滑、光華乘地利之宜、頻頻壓迫、未幾曁南塲地已熟習、奮勇前進、迭在光華門前環攻、厥狀甚險、此後球常盤旋於光華腹地、幸光華內衛、奔走應付、得免於難、光華偶得機會、即行反攻、惜前鋒軟弱、不能利用、交臂失之、董叔昭因傷出塲、曁南後衛雖慓悍善戰、而前鋒合作欠佳、往往因循遺誤、或聯絡不準、或地位不均、舉足攻門之機會甚少、上半時以零比零終、</p>
<p>曁南失機</p>
<p>易地後衆信暨南必可操勝算、開球後、即長驅直入、氣燄可熾、光華後衛趙靄生、舉脚落空、但暨南呼應不靈、未有所獲、再度繞攻、仍苦無機、直搗黃龍、而光華反由左路直迫曁門、造成一度虛驚、迄後曁南鑒於過去失敗、均係在後衛綫派司太多、坐失良機、翻然改計、利用射擊、果然光華門前胡茄四起、曁南先後所踢角球不下十餘次、但均為光華截獲、光華雖偶而反攻、亦祗曇花一現、曁南中堅梁樹棠、奔馳全塲、最為賣力、無如王南珍門前失機、鍾育祥主踢十二碼、又被接、雖鼓足精神、累次壓迫敵門、大好機會、均成過眼烟雲、結果又以零比零終局、茲將兩隊陣容列後、</p>

<h3>小男兒（一一七）</h3>
<p>— Louisa　M.　Alcott原著鄭曉滄澤</p>
<p>一會兒南恩幾乎心都停了；以她平日的勇敢，想到一個眞熊，也覺得不是玩意的事，她正要旋轉身子，慌慌張張逃了，忽然聽到一陣溫和的牛鳴，使她彌天的恐懼頓時化作滿腔的笑樂，於是她說道：</p>
<p>「是一隻母牛，羅勃！我們今天下午看見的那隻好好的黑牛。」</p>
<p>那母牛也覺希奇怎麼會在黑夜遇見兩個小朋友在她的牧塲之上，因此這脾氣好好的聰明動物也停下來一查究竟。她儘讓他們撫摩牠，兀自立着看他們，她顯出那麼柔和的眼色，因此南恩，本來除黑熊以外，什麼畜生也不怕的，驀地决心要取她的乳。</p>
<p>「賴司務敎我怎樣取乳；莓菒拌了牛乳又是那麼好吃，」她說道，於是把她手桶裏所盛的盡傾入她的帽子裏，大胆地開始她的新工作，一面羅勃立在旁邊，依照着她的命令，連唱着以下一首的歌兒：</p>
<p>「肥美的好母牛，</p>
<p>給我們以鮮奶五斗，</p>
<p>給我們以鮮奶五斗，</p>
<p>我們還要你香草百畝。」</p>
<p>唱得儘管起勁，効力還是毫無，因為那母牛的乳剛才有人取過，所以只有一勺來給這兩個苦渴的孩子。</p>

<p>金難靜中帶軟</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月一致平疲、塲內交易殊覺稀少、因此市况軟化惟金融界及金帮多頭拉緊、市盤未見有大變動、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌一·四七·八角、午後開盤市氣忽見衰弱、各月均跌三·四·五角、但長豐又來扒空、二三盤又轉上昇、迨至收盤遠月略回數角、結果各月比上午收盤價漲跌一·二·三·六角、查賣出達記一千三百五十包、大豐四百包、賡豐四百包、永昌四百包、泰興一千零五十包、元一七百包、潤康六百包、永大四百五十包、信誠四百包、買進明德四百包、合興一千一百五十包、長豐一千八百五十包、愼記七百包、同和一千一百包、大豐三五十包、永昌三百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<p>棉市穩靜、海外棉業狀况亦覺平定、但日商東棉洋行及通記大孚代銀行界吸收不已、一般棉商、一致大量拋賣、前途變遷、殊難逆料、不過目前外棉比價較本棉高十元左右、本月花收盤價比上週收盤價漲二元五角半、</p>

<h3>食米銷清價跌</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨各幫來源共到五十餘號、（貨共一萬餘千石）本街銷塲轉淸、包胃亦懈、祇去三千餘包、故市况見疲、若薄稻低近角、厚粳及早稻跌一二角、杜洋尖小角許、陰變元價亦不振、</p>

<h3>絲茶　絲市漸隨日絲好轉</h3>
<p>本埠絲市、因邇來橫濱絲價轉好、而呈活躍、市氣有堅挺希望、然據云日絲價漲、係該處廠商硬行提高、故滬埠絲價預測、尚須觀橫濱囤戶持力如何而定云、</p>
<h3>茶市略形清淡</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊茶市、略形淸談、各歐莊均以上星期國外來電定購之貨、已辦足額、近期發出兜銷電訊、杳無回音、是以轉持觀望熊度、全市僅祇怡和永興合中等行、買進針眉秀眉等綠茶、共計一　百餘箱、市價尚稱穩定云、</p>

<h3>強肉弱食</h3>
<p>— 寗自强</p>
<p>小朋友，自從英國達爾文進化論行泄，我們便公認「優勝劣敗，弱肉强食」為天演的公理，可是事實吿訴我們不惟强食弱，有時也弱食强，先定「個「假設，」且來一下證明罷！</p>
<p>一，刺蝟食老虎：「猛虎在深山，百獸為之震恐！」可是歡喜吃葷的老虎，「急不暇擇」有時也會「碰釘子，」刺蝟就是老虎的死對頭，他如果遇着老虎，便會屈曲如球，任憑老虎生吞活剝，及至下咽之後，他便大奮神威，慢慢的咀嚼老虎的臟腑。</p>

<h3>待人寬恕的裴行儉</h3>
<p>— 魏冰心</p>
<p>唐朝時候的裴行儉，通兵法，善知人，是一員有名的將官。他雖然一向生活在行伍中，可是性情溫厚，待人寬恕，絕對沒有武人的粗暴習氣。</p>
<p>在當時，大食國發生亂事，高宗特派行儉做安撫使，前去勘定。行儉奉命以後，便帶了一枝兵，走了幾萬里路，終於打平叛黨，建立奇功，當他凱旋回來的時候，大食國王特地挑選許多珍珠寳物，送給他做紀念品。</p>
<p>那些珍寳，伴件都是很貴重的東西。行儉帶回以後，小心地藏著，從來不肯輕易給人觀玩。有一天，他設筵欵待部下的將士，便叫護兵去取出那些珍寳，陳列在大廳上，給公衆鑑賞。</p>
<p>其中有一個最貴重的瑪瑙盤，圓徑有二尺多長，文彩非常雅緻，是行儉最心愛的玩物。不料，由護兵王休烈捧了這個瑪瑙盤從階下走上大廳的當兒，不知怎麼一個不小心，左脚忽然踏住衣襟，身體便絆倒了。手裏捧著的瑪瑙盤，也就撞在階沿石上，撞得粉碎。</p>
<p>王休烈闖了這個大禍，自然萬分驚駭。當下就在行儉前面，叩頭求饒，甚至額上磕破了皮，流出血來。</p>
<p>在別的武人，見護兵毁壞了他心愛的玩物，至少要責備幾句，甚或要責打幾板。可是行儉素來待人寬恕，沒有一般武人的習氣。當時他不動聲色，和藹地說道：「快站起來！——盤子打碎了，就算了；你並不是故意毁壞的，何必這樣呢」？</p>

<h3>蒸汽車</h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>敏兒的家是和市鎭離開得很遠的，所以他家裏的吃喝，都是由自己預備的。</p>
<p>水是不可不喝的，因為水竈要的水不十分淸潔，並且又很遠，因此煮水也是自己動手的了。</p>
<p>一天，敏兒的家裏來了一位客人，於是他的爸爸叫他兄弟倆快快去煮水。</p>
<p>敏兒和聰兒去拿了一隻水壺，盛滿了天落水，放在一隻整天不斷火的爐子上煮，一會兒，水已煮沸了。一陣陣的水蒸汽，把那水壺蓋舉了起來；於是他倆各自倒了一碗茶，去給那客人和爸爸去了。</p>
<p>『弟弟，你見了覺得有什麼奇特？」他倆回到了廚房，聰兒指着那壺蓋被水蒸汽舉起時問着他——敏兒。</p>
<p>『我不知道；請你吿訴我罷。」</p>
<p>『瓦特，他是英國人，幼年是很細心的，他不論看見一件東西，經過一件事情，總是自己先問着自己：「這是什麼道理？為什麼要這樣做？」等到他自己也回答不出的時侯，便去問他的爸媽。有一天，他和他的爸媽在吃午餐，桌子上正在煮水，不多一會，那壺裏的水已沸了。他看水見壺裏的沸水的蒸汽把壺蓋舉起，就感到水蒸汽的力量很大，於是他一年一年的專心研究，終於被他發明這一件極重要的機械，世果上那一個人不佩服他。「有志者事竟成」這一句話到底不錯啊！』</p>
<p>「哥哥，那麼他是首創蒸汽機的鼻祖哩。』</p>
<p>『他也不可算是首創的人。早在紀元前二三世紀中，已經有埃及人發明，不過簡單一些罷了。後來經過了七八個歐美大科學家的發明和改進，而最大的功績，還要歸於瓦特，就是經他改進之後，蒸汽機仍沒有停止它的改進，直到現在蒸汽機還在進步哩。』</p>
<p>『蒸汽機的構造是怎樣的？」</p>
<p>『蒸汽機中的重要的器具有六部：就是鍋爐，汽櫃，汽蓋，汽筒，活塞和飛輪、鍋裏的水化成了汽，經地汽管而到汽櫃。由汽蓋支配汽路，再送到汽筒的一端。推動活塞，旋動飛輪。當汽蓋在古時，汽從左路到汽筒要去，汽蓋在左時，汽從右路到筒裏去，這樣的活塞左右或上下移動，飛輸就旋轉不息了。火車上是裝這機械的，我們應當叫它是汽車。」</p>
<h3>蟹</h3>
<p>— 達齋</p>
<p>蟹本是一年四季都有的，為什麼「九月團臍十月尖」，在這等時候，吃的人就那麼多呢？因為蟹到這時，「腦滿腸肥」，有那膏腴的黃和那鮮美的肉，引動人類的垂涎，由是覬覦着，引誘着，終於被人剝奪吞噬。</p>
<p>於此可見雖有錦繡河山，若無保存實力，沒有不被人侵佔的，別的不說，我們只看全部的非洲，怎麼都是列强的屬地，土人反不能自主呢？這就是個比例</p>
<p>弱肉强食，天演公理，蟹生在水鄉，與人無爭且無害於人，可是它那些微的雙螫武力，終不能防衛自己的安全，「秋老難逃一背紅」，赤化了，犧牲了，不怪强者强，只怪弱者弱啊！</p>
<p>蟹煮熟了，便會赤化，很是特別，當然不外甲殼上關係，但甲魚不也是有甲殼麼，那末，甲魚煮熟後，為何不會變成紅色而赤化呢？理由是；蟹的身體上，雖是靑灰色，並有各種色素如靑色綠色紅色褐色和黃色等等，是在皮下混合變成的；在這幾種色素中，要算紅色最為堅牢，所以在煮沸以後，旁的色素都脫落了，只有紅色素，還是存在着，蝦也同一理。</p>
<h3>「某」字的意義</h3>
<p>— 康健齋夫</p>
<p>大概小學三四年以上的學生，便沒有個不認識這個「某」字。也沒有個不知道這「某」字的用法。例是「某人」，「某處」，這一個人「姓某」，「名某」。大抵總是代表一個尙未知道的對象。</p>
<p>專制的時代，這「某」字有幾種特別的用法，凡是臣下說到君王的名字，不能把這名字照實讀起來，只能用「某」字來代替。其次對於聖賢的名字，例如孔夫子的孔丘，只能讀「孔某」，孟夫子的孟軻，只能說「孟某」。據說這樣便是表示尊敬，免得「觸犯天威」，或是「褻凟神聖」。</p>
<p>專制的時代雖然已成過去，可是近來報紙上的「某」字却活躍得更加利害。小學生們每看到報紙，有誤會現在世界上除英國，美國，俄國，意國等等以外，</p>

<h3>世界最古的寫字工具</h3>
<p>— 尤墨君</p>
<p>寫字工具逃不了紙，筆和墨水。在我國除近今所用各色墨水本非我國所固有外，筆為秦朝蒙恬所造，紙為漢朝蔡倫所製：這大家已經知道了，不多說。</p>
<p>說起紙，筆，墨水，元前四千年已有人發明了。埃及是世界最古的文明國，古代埃及人是世界最聰明的和最善創製的民族。那時他們製造墨水是這樣的；淸水中和以植物膠汁少許，再從煮物的泥罐下刮下烟煤把它攪在膠水中，這樣墨水就製成了。筆呢；製法更加簡單。取一枝度桿，削尖其一端，就可、蘸了墨水寫字。</p>
<p>再說造紙。這自然沒有和製筆，做墨水那麼簡單的。埃及有條尼羅河，是全國的水源所在。河旁生着一種蘆草，叫做配配勒斯Papyrs。現在我們已知道植物的纖維質都可造紙的，然而西元前四千年埃及人已早知道可以利用「配配勒斯」造紙了。造法是把「配配勒斯」撕成細條，再壓之使平，然後再把那細條一條一條地黏合起來。這樣就成為一張一張的白紙了。紙，英國叫做「配潘」Papel。這就是從配配勒斯Papyrus轉成的。</p>
<p>按蒙恬約生於西元前二百多年，蔡倫約生在西元一百年前後，故我國紙筆發明，和埃及比，著實還後。這足見古代埃及人是世界最聰明的和最善創製的民族了。更有一個猙獰可怖，咄咄逼人的「某國「　，不知道究竟是那一個國度。</p>
<p>這「某國」的軍隊可以在我國境內任意演習作戰，任意佔據車站，任意强迫人民簽字蓋章，任意開槍射擊。飛機可以任意在我國領空飛翔偵察。事實統統擺在眼前，然而我們的報紙依然不得不表示尊敬，免得「觸犯天威」。</p>
<p>說文。「某，古梅字，酸果也。」這「某，字眞是令人看了酸心呵！</p>
<h3>水的種類</h3>
<p>— 楚玉</p>
<p>水的種類很多，而且與我們身體關係最大，從電力分解起來，有重水與輕水的分別，就是水的原素之中，有比重是重的水素，與比重是輕的水素，普通的水，是二個輕的水素和一個酸素化合的，重水是二個重的水素和一個酸素化合而成的。再從水的分子說起來，從普通分子而成的，有二個分子與三個分子合成的區別。對於我們身體，最宜的水，為二個分子與三個分子合成的若一個分子的單純水，那很（有害身體，一個分子的水，多從水蒸氣變成。譬如天上落下來的雨水，是一個分子而成的，可是落下來的時候，已在空氣中得了種種瓦斯與有機物，到了地面，已與普通的水差不多了。然而這水實不宜飲，最惡的水，為蒸溜水，因為是一個極單純分子所成的水，因為過於純粹，飲了這水後，在身體的細胞，與水質的滲透作用，相差得太遠，往往要瀉痢。普通所用的水，大都為二個分子以上所成，如河川池塘等水，三個分子所成的水，就是由冰溶解的水，所以冰水對於我們身體上是很有利益的。</p>
<h3>白山烏的故事（十三）</h3>
<p>— 禧</p>
<p>我仰天大呼道；「如此只有我一個兒不許快樂嗎？讓我們離開這裏，逃開這殘酷的世界，我還是向黑暗中找尋我的出路，就是被甚麼貓頭鷹吞吃了也好，免得看了別人的快樂，引起我的痛苦來。」</p>
<p>我這樣想着，重又出發，毫無目的的亂飛了好久，到得第一道的晨光透露時，就看見了聖母寺的鐘塔。一霎時間，我早就飛到了那裏，低頭一看便見下邊正是我們的花園。我像閃電一般的飛了下去……呀，園子是空了！……我空喚着我的父親和母親…始終沒有答應的聲音。我的父親慣常棲身的那株樹，母親的那隻親愛的碗，完全不見了。一柄利斧早已毀滅了一切；我再也瞧不見我那生長的一倏綠巷，只看見一百多捆的柴薪罷了。</p>
<p>（六）</p>
<p>我先在園子裏找尋我的父親和母親，然而這全是白白費力的事；他們一定是避在甚麼很遠的地方，我再也得不到他們的消息了。我懷着一重深刻的憂鬱，去停留在當初我的父親驅逐我的那個溝渠上，我就日夜的留在那裏，感覺到無窮的悲哀。我再也不能入睡，也吃不下甚麼東西；我似乎要憂鬱死了。</p>
<p>這樣一連過了十多天，我只是死守在這溝渠溝帶，眼巴巴地盼望着我的父母回來，那知一天又一天的過去，竟一些兒希望都沒有。我心中暗暗的想；他們也許是躱在甚麼很隱蔽的所在，瞧不見我，我倘若提高了喉嚨發出我那特殊的聲音來，那就能達到他們的耳邊，他們聽了之後，免不了要趕回來瞧瞧他們這個久別的兒子。於是我就伸長了頭頸，盡力地呌喚着，日夜的呌個不停，一聲聲的呌着道。「父親呀！你在那裏？你可還想到你這不幸的兒子嗎？母親呀！你是一同愛我的，快快回來！和我見面吧！」</p>
<p>天哪！求你發一陣風把我這弱小的聲音，遠遠地吹開去，吹到我的父親和母親的耳中，讓他們立時飛回來，和我見面吧！</p>
<p>可憐我白天也呌着，晚上也呌着，直呌得喉嘟都嘶啞了，而我的父親和母親終於不見回來。何等的悲哀！何等的寂寞！眼瞧着別的烏巢裏父母和子女們都團聚在一起，相親相愛，我又是何等的羨慕呀！</p>
<p>天哪！我再也不能死守着這一條溝渠了。我得飛到天涯，飛到地角，飛遍了全世界，去找尋我的父親和母親！再會吧！朋友們！我去！我從此去了！（完）</p>

<h3>美國的黃金禍</h3>
<p>— 汪元芳</p>
<p>誰都知道美國是世界的黃金國。據最近的統計，世界各國的中央銀行的存金約為二百十六億七千萬美金，其中美國就佔了百分之四十五。這就是說美國現在已幾乎擁有了世界黃金的半數。同時，從本年九月上旬起，歐洲的黃金更在不住地流向美國，使之幾乎每天都要增加幾白萬幾千萬的巨額的黃金，結果是美國所有的黃金竟突破了九十五億美金。因此，一部分財界的人們都發出「黃金禍」的呼聲。午一月二十四日的「申報一上曾載有這樣的一段新聞：「據美財部最近報吿，美國庫存黃金共值一，九六〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇鎊，而繼續運來者猶多。從九月起，國外黃金之流入，多至一二五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇鎊，其來自法國者七二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇鎊，來自英國者三〇，〇〇〇鎊，來自荷蘭一二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇鎊。衆對此黃金源源流入之氣象，不無憂慮，蓋以未有用途之黃金現已充塞於銀行，若再大批流人，恐將助成潛伏的放欵與膨脹之勃興也。」由此可見所謂「黃金禍」的呼聲並不是沒有來由的。</p>
<p>事實上，自去年一月末實行美元貶價以來，美國所有黃金就顯示出了如下的日益增加　。</p>
<p>（單位百萬美金）</p>
<p>去年一月末　六、八二九</p>
<p>去年十二月末　八、八、一三八</p>
<p>本年八月末　九、一九七</p>
<p>本年十月中旬　九、五八四</p>
<p>從上表，可知從去年十一月起到本年十月中旬止，美國所有黃金已增加了二十幾億美金。這些黃金的來源如下：</p>
<p>（單位百萬美金）</p>
<p>從法國來者　八三八</p>
<p>從英國來者　七四七</p>
<p>從荷蘭來者　三一八</p>
<p>從加拿大來者　一六〇</p>
<p>從印度來者　一二三</p>
<p>從其他地方來者　一六七</p>
<p>共計　二、三五三</p>
<p>本來過去歐洲各國還有逃避海外的美國資本的還流，但近來大部分在歐洲的黃金都由於歐洲政局的不安，金集團的動搖，而流往美國求避難所了。至於印度黃金之所以流入美國者，則　隨着金價騰貴而來的。</p>
<p>看來好像很奇怪似的，即是過去從英國流人美國的黃金，並非英國自有的黃金，主要是歐洲大陸資本經過英國而流往美國的。從去年一月到本年八月英國的黃金移動對美國是一億三千八百萬鎊的出超，但其全體則是二億七百萬鎊的入超。其細目如下：</p>
<p>（單位百萬鎊）</p>
<p>從法國流大者　九六</p>
<p>從荷蘭流入者　一三</p>
<p>從印度流入者　六〇</p>
<p>從南非流入者　一〇〇</p>
<p>流出者六二</p>
<p>出入相較入超　二〇七</p>
<p>但是，自本年九月以來的情形就不同了，英國的黃金直接或者經由法國流入美國者也不少。其結果是在從八月末到十月十日的六週間，造成了九百八十萬鎊的出超。其詳情如下：</p>
<p>（單位百萬鎊）</p>
<p>輸入細額　一九·〇</p>
<p>從南非　一〇·〇</p>
<p>從印度　五·七</p>
<p>從法國　〇·七</p>
<p>從荷蘭　一·〇</p>
<p>輸出總額　二八·八</p>
<p>向美國　二二·三</p>
<p>向法國　一·八</p>
<p>然而，因為過去流入的黃金較多，所以近來英國流出的黃金雖有增加，但無多大關係。同時，最近兩週英國黃金的流出已有逐漸减少之勢。據報載。「到十三日止之一週間，英國黃金輸出較前减少，輸入則見增多。輸出總額為二九二七〇〇〇鎊，較上週减少二〇五二〇〇〇鎊，其中運往美國者八三〇〇〇鎊，荷蘭三五八〇〇〇鎊，瑞典五一一〇〇〇鎊，德國二一三〇〇鎊，法國一一七〇〇〇鎊。輸入總數為二八七五〇〇〇鎊，來自非洲者、一八二〇〇〇鎊，印度云九五〇〇〇鎊，法國一一二六〇〇〇鎊，德國一二六〇〇〇鎊。」又，至二十日止之一週間，英國黃金之輸出還在减少。其輸出總額為一·七八三·〇〇〇鎊，較上週减少一·一四四〇〇〇鎊。輸入總數為一一·九八七〇〇〇鎊，凈輸入為一·二〇四·〇〇〇鎊，較上週增多一·一五六〇〇〇鎊。由此可見最近英國黃金輸出已不如九月以來的日益增加的情况了。不過，由英國輸出的黃金，還是直接間接流入美國，所以美國黃金的輸入並不因英國的輸出减少而停止增加。</p>
<p>在世界黃金源源流向美國中，值得特別注意的是法國。本來法國所存黃金佔世界的百分之二十二，其數量僅次於美國。同時，當世界各國先後放棄金本位時，法國仍努力維持，並構成金集團，以與美元和英鎊對抗。但是，最近以來，由於國內左右兩極端爭鬥日益尖銳，經濟政治危機之發展，使世界第二的黃金國法蘭西的現金大量地向外流出。十一月一十六日報載：「自法蘭西銀行在上星期三發表每週報吿後，仍有大批金貨流出國外。該銀行乃於本月將貼現率再行提高，即由五厘增至六厘，以資補救。一般人估計自十一月十四日以來，國內金貨流出國外者當在十萬法郎以上，此項數目字政府當於星期三正式發表，預料屆時法蘭西銀行每週報吿所列之金銀貨幣存額，當由七百萬萬法郎降至穴百九十萬萬法郎。……至目下存金六百九十萬萬法郎之水準，則與一九三一年的庫存數目相近。一這樣大量的黃金，當然是以流入美國者為最多。就目前形勢看來，法國黃金還有繼續流出的可能，因之美國黃金還要增加。</p>
<p>但是金貨是流動的，假使據有大量的黃金沒有用途，那反要招來禍害。美國目前就因為大量的黃金流入與銀券增發的關係，各銀行的過剩準備現在已達三十億美金了，而利率依然顯示着從來未有的低下。這對於一般產業界雖然很好，但對於正努力於收益狀態之改善的銀行，到是並不好的。同時，過剩準備金的增加有招來通貨膨脤之危險。最近美國一個銀行月報曾發出這樣的警吿：「黃金之流入美國並得不到怎樣恒久的利益，因為急激地流入的資本將來有急激地流出的可能。而且，黃金現在已沒有用處，反而有威脅性。」該報並指出目前美國銀行準備金已上昇到了極高的數字，所以黃金的增加將發生膨脹的危險</p>
<p>目前的世界就是這樣的，有的國家是金融乾涸，缺乏現金，有的則是黃金過多，發生危害。美國的「黃金禍」即是後者的表現，也就是資本主義沒落期中的一種畸形表現。</p>
<p>藝壇</p>
<h3>評「船家女」</h3>
<p>— 陳數旬</p>
<p>我記得在「五四」時代便有一部份知識婦女實地參加「婦女解放運動」，同時還大聲的呼喊者「婦女職業平等」，「女子婚姻自由」，「女子經濟獨立」等反封建的口號。由五四到現在已有十五六年的歷史了，在這不短的過程中，究竟中國婦女解放到如何的程度呢？據我個人的觀察，除了少數知域婦女取得了「花瓶。　的歸　　　　有　　　　姨　　外，其餘的不是還在家庭里當奴隷，便是走上了一船家女一阿玲的命運—娼妓。</p>
<p>這是什麼原因呢？「船家女一在他的序幕里暗示着，努力婦女解放運動的男女，口號是喊得震天價的響，宣傳工夫做得很起勁，但是他們（或她們）自己便是玩弄女性的魔王，或是給別人玩弄的工具，正如序曲里所說：熱心的仕女發着動聽的高能，　娼的口號響遏行雲，散會後何　銷魂　，臺舞　的躭　志　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　作者是緊緊地把握着的，同時所給予的嘲笑和諷刺也很合理而且應該的，雖然婦女解放運動失敗的主要原囚，劇作者並未提出，也沒有加以暗示。</p>
<p>也許由於劇作者情威的豐富，有好幾個塲面都充滿了情感的氣氛，而劇中人又是那麼熱情奔放。如像鐵兒和阿玲父女相互間的親熱態度，和互助的精神，是值得贊美欽佩的。同時在鐵兒發現了阿玲夤夜鑽進他的屋子里，並且明白了往日的「謎」（阿玲悄悄的給他補好了衣服，煮好了飯）以後那種驚喜態度，以及阿玲的少女含羞的姿態，都表現着一種不可抑止的熱情；雖然他倆沒有說出一句話，然而無限心中事，盡在不言中，情感的熟力比千言萬語還要偉大些呢。及至阿玲含羞遁走後，鐵兒的狂喜動作（狂喜的跳躍）尤其是情感澎漲到了沸騰點，這一塲面我認為是最有精彩，最緊張，最輕鬆，最能抓住觀衆的心理，這都是劇作者熱情的灌漑。然而正因為情感過分的豐富，如果任其狂放的發展，是可歪曲理智的。譬如阿玲被迫為娼後鐵兒在妓院里找着了她，那種情意纏綿的樣子固然很使人感動，同時因激於義憤而瘋狂般的打嫖客，鬧妓院，却也够痛快，但這也只能說是個人主義的英雄表演。要知道製造罪惡者不是嫖客，也不是開設妓院的龜奴鴇母，徒然悲憤發氣或一陣打鬧，是不能消滅罪惡，解决問題的。</p>
<p>此外還有一二小疵：第一，小艇招攬乘客，相互間常要發生營業競爭和衝突，這情形無論在當道的渡口，或是遊客衆多的湖邊，都很尋常的。我們如果走到玄武湖去，剛到堤口，拉客的呼聲便震天價的響，而且還要給他們搶過去，奪過來。可是「船家女」中的湖邊小艇却沒有這種現象，阿玲和她的父親雖喊着「到岳墳去哦」，却是那麼簡短的一聲，兩聲，很缺乏生活恐慌的意味。第二，關於他們的居處，我覺得環境是太美好了，尤其是鐵兒住的地方，內面是那麼「窗明儿凈」，外面又有大樹小竹環繞着，假如不說是織工的棲息處，我倒要誤認為騷人墨客的「書齋」呢！</p>
<p>生活指導</p>
<h3>怎樣操縱團體</h3>
<p>— 熊子</p>
<p>穴居野處的時代，根本沒有社會，所以談不到組織。後來人羣交接的機會日多，為共同利益的保障，乃漸形成社會的形式。時至近代，科學昌明，人為社會的交接更形頻繁，無　政治，　濟，私人企業等　，　　　　　　　兩組織，行科學的管理，然後效果顯，事業成。故團體組織可說唯智慧高於一切生物的人類才有。也可說團體組織為文明進化的象徵</p>
<p>顧組織之效用很多，茲略述重要者如後：</p>
<p>第一，一個人的精神，任聖賢豪傑，總是有限的。煩雜的事務决不是一個人所能勝任，智識能力也非一個人所能全備，於是必須得多數人的共同合作和褒理，才能負起重大的責任。</p>
<p>第二，近世盛行會議制度以代獨裁制度，可免迂於一人的偏見，而得集思廣益之效。　　　　　　精密組織則分工易，且能人盡其用。近世工業中科學管理實行的結果，行動敏捷，生產量增加，各部工人猶如機械相互關連，主持者使用工人猶如撥動機械。美國福特汽車製造公司為聞名世界的工廠，出品數量極為可驚，其所以能得如此效果者，直接因得分工合作之妙用，間接為受精密組織之賜。</p>
<p>第四，有組織可養成規律的生活，由規律生活漸成習慣，凡一種動作變成習慣之後，無形中便可節省許多精力。人的精力有限，能節省可節省的精力，致力於事業的精進上，自然效果要好得多。</p>
<p>第五，有精密組織，有分工，就可為事擇人，使有專長的能力和才幹者獲得發展的機會，庶不致再興「英雄無用武之地」之嘆。</p>
<p>組織之原素有二，一是「事務」，一是「人」。要操縱團體，「專務」與「人」須都能充分使之為我用，若缺其一，必遭失敗。</p>
<p>操縱事務應遵下列原則：</p>
<p>（一）系統—做領袖的人，因事務叢集，若無系統的處理，一方面必為處理瑣碎事務而至精力俱瘁，另一方面因為枝節的瑣事所困，必至長才覊絆，不能自遣。</p>
<p>（二）利用—處理事務，可利用者有二：一，應隨時利用機器，其利有二，甲’時間節省，乙，效果比手工更佳；二，在可能範圍內應隨時利用各部辦事員，使事務分任。</p>
<p>以下我們冉進而討論操縱事務的方法：</p>
<p>（一）事務的分析：</p>
<p>A分類—紛然雜陳的種種事務歸納在幾個類別之下：譬如「未完的事務」，「函牘」，電報」，「電話」，「來賓」等等</p>
<p>B分等—按事務的輕重緩急分成等級，譬如以輕重為標準，函牘一類中有重要的，例行的，應酬的種種，應該分別出那種為應待歸卷，待考備査的？那種可交助手撰擬的？那種應由自己親辦的等。其以緩急為標準者當然應將急的先辦，可緩的暫綏，應免償事。</p>
<p>（二）機械的利用：</p>
<p>事務應該怎樣治理？怎樣治理才算上乘？若是一個有條理的人，一定能够思慮周詳，不致盲然蠢動。並且臨到動手治事的時候，更能利用種種機械帮助其處理事務，而得整然有序的效果。</p>
<p>可利用的處理事務的器械甚多，茲略舉幾種如下：</p>
<p>（一）辦事台—分列「歸檔卷」，「應辦事務」等抽屜。</p>
<p>（二）備忘錄—或用書本，或有活頁，均視便利而定。也有利用日歷硬卡兼作備忘錄的，如適用亦無不可。</p>
<p>（三）文件箱子箱子上分列各欄，標以簽識，考查時，鞍所列某欄抽屜取之，甚覺便利。</p>
<p>此外如喚鈴，名片索引，空白單，圖表等等，亦都是處理事務所不可少的用品。</p>
<p>（三）人的使任：</p>
<p>煩雜的人事决不能由一人單獨負責或處理。魯濱遜誠能在荒島上獨力維持他的生活，但到底那種生活方式是很原始的，用現代的眼光看來，這種辦法在實際上是絕無僅有，在原則上也是極不經濟的。因為人類智慧不同，各人所能做的事也必各各不同，譬如工程師要能打出科學化藝術化的圖樣，土木工匠要能按着工程師打的圖樣去建造房屋，各人的職務是不同的。你若强工程師打了圖樣又要親自動手蓋屋子，先不論他蓋的屋子是否為力所專長，但把時間都浪費了，終是一個極不經濟的辦法。</p>
<p>善於處事者未必一定要「事必躬親」，而要能善於使任他人。任你是英雄好漢，精力終是有限的，若事必躬親，糜費精力太多，則反有害無益。拿破崙是個不可多得的英傑，精力之充實也高人一等，以是細大不捐，諸事獨當，可是曾幾何時，精力漸衰，萊錫克之役，一人力已不逮，僚屬平時又無訓練，於是大受重創。</p>
<p>所以處理事務的方式，應如臂使手，如手使指，指使得宜，事乃成功。</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>（四）常務之處理：</p>
<p>每日走進辦事處，就有許多日常事務等待你來料理。你對付這些常務，不但應該「適合」，而且還應該「迅速」。</p>
<p>第一步，應查考暫記錄中所記「未完的事務」，先行處理</p>
<p>第二步，檢查行事歷中所列今日應辦的事務丁處理之。</p>
<p>第三步，處理新生事件。</p>
<p>處理新生事件時，應留意條理的淸晰，如（一）須立辦者，應歸入緊急類。（二）要使人照辦者，應婦入委辦類，（三）如待考證的，應列入暫記箱中，務使井井有條，絲毫不紊。</p>

<h3>研究地理的方法與政治地理學</h3>
<p>— 慶棠女士</p>
<p>我們在中小學讀書時，在功課中除英算之外，最便性最死板的恐怕要算地理吧。那時的所謂地理教科書所記載的都是山嶽，沙漠，鐵道，都市，海洋，河流，港灣，海峽，島嶼等等的名稱和方位：地理教師們當然也只知道「抱本書科一，依據教科書和地圖要學生們死記着無數的地名及其形勢；考試呢？那自不必說是依據平時教師的教和學生的學的，其考題不是問太平洋上共有好多島嶼及其名稱和方位若何，便是問喜馬拉雅山有好高或安逹斯山有好長。像這樣的學習地理，怎麼不會使人覺得地理是很枯燥無味的一種學科呢？</p>
<p>其實地理的內容並不那麼簡單，死板。概括言之，凡是地理形勢和一切自然現象，與夫人類生活和它們的關係，都是地理的研究對象。因此，研究地理便不僅是牢記地名及其方位，甚至說不僅是牢記一切目然現象和地理形勢，而是應該去理解其所以然，理解其與人生的關係。譬如，要理解阿比西尼亞的雨期是怎樣來的，何以西半球和東半球的畫夜完全相反，南北兩極為什麼是半年為畫半年為夜，與夫日蝕月蝕和海潮漲退的原因，那便非有「上知天文」「下曉地理」的知識不可。又如，在說明黃河長江與過去中國文明的關係上，在說明尼羅河於古代埃及文明中所起的作用上，就必須兼有地理和歷史學社會學的知識。再說，假使只去死記多瑙河為歐洲第二長流，經過瑞士。德·奧·匈·捷克·巨哥斯拉夫·保加利亞和羅馬尼亞等八國而入於黑海，那自然是很簡單，死板，但若要理解法德意奧匈和小恊約國乃至　蘭英國等在多瑙河上的衝突，那就很複雜而有趣味了；但這除知道多瑙河地理形勢外，還須懂得政治經濟學，懂得多瑙河流域的政治形勢才行。基於這些事實，所以我們認為地理實在是一種很複雜很重要的學問；研究地理不僅要靠記憶力，而且還要靠理解力，要具有各科的常識去理解一切地理形勢和自然現象。</p>
<p>這樣說來，研究地理豈不是比什麼都要困難嗎？但是，我們說要研究地理必須具有各科常識，並不是要你去把各種學科都作一個透激研究，而是要你為了理解地理形勢和自然現象去獲得某種程度的各科的一般知識。譬如，在理解南北極的半年為畫半年為夜的事情時，你只要知道地球的形態和其運轉與人間的晝夜之關係就夠了，並不需要成為一個專門的頂瓜瓜的天文學家。事實上，一切學科都是有聯繫性的，隨便研究什麼學問都必須要具有其他畢科的相當常織。比方說，研究歷史的人，他就非有關於社會學·人種學·地理學·政治經濟學等等的相當知識不可。其他研究什何學科者也是一樣。</p>
<p>同時，地球雖是客觀地存在於我們的腦筋之外，但一切地理形勢和自然現象都與我們的生活有直接間接的關係。河流海洋之能便利我們的交通，山岳沙漠之能使我們不易來往，狂風暴雨之有碍於我們的航行，各地天然物產之有益於我們的生活，都是地理形勢和自然現象與人類生活有密切關係的明證。我們研究地理不是為的多記一些地名，主要的是為的要理解地理與人類生活的關係，並從而利用這種地理知識去努力促進人類與自然的關係之進化，以日益改善我們的生活。所以，我們對於地理除作一般的槪括的研究外，更須特別從人類生活與地理的關係上去研究。這一裏我們為方便起見，特分做三方面來說——</p>
<p>（一）怎樣研究地理形勢？對於地理形勢，主要的當然是要從其與國家，民族，人類社會的關係上去理解。比如我們在研究巴爾幹半島的形勢時，知道它是突出於黑海和地中海之間，扼著歐亞二洲的咽喉，這當然是必要的，但是，假使我們不去研究戰前的英俄德法意奧在這里的衝突，不去研究戰後的英法意和小協約國的國內情形以及它們與這地方的政治乃至軍事上的關係，那就是知道巴爾幹有那樣的地理形勢也是無用的。因為目前巴爾幹在地理上之重要，乃是在歐洲列強的複雜的政治關係下形成的，假使不明白巴爾幹的複雜嚴重的政治形勢，則其重要的地理形勢便無從理解。此外，如研究太平洋的形勢，波羅的海的形勢，多瑙河流域的形勢……，都必要知道某些國家在這些地方的經濟政治乃至軍事上的關係，才能理解其地理形勢之所以重要。其理由已如上述</p>
<p>（二）關於各地的氣候的研究。人類進化到了現在，氣候的寒熱當然不能直接地絕對地影響於人的生活，人們用氣候的寒熱去說明各個民族性乃是對於自然的作用過分誇大的表現。但氣候之能影響於動植物的生存，對人類生活還有或多或少的作用，乃是無庸否認的事實。，而且，就是現在有些地方的氣候也還是正在抗禦人力的。如南北極，現在雖為人類所探得，但因其氣候太寒，而且是半年為畫半年為夜，所以人類在那里還是不易生活，那里的豐富的物產也還是沒有全都開發出來帮助人的生活。因為這些關係，我們在研究地理氣候時，除須知道某地的氣候情形及其所以有那樣的氣候外，更當知道其氣候是適宜於生產什麼物品，與當地的人的生活有什麼關係；假使某地的氣候太寒或太然，妨害人類生活，那便應該更進一步的去征服牠。要這樣去研究地理的氣候，才有益於人類生活，否則若只是知道某地寒某地冷和某地溫暖，那是沒有好大用處的。</p>
<p>（三）研究各地的物產。物產與人類生活之有更直接的關係，這是用不着說的。因之研究各地的物產，當然要和人類的生活關係聯絮起來。不過，我們在這中間，更當特別注意各地物產與各個國家間的關係，因為這還可以使我們得到一些國際知識。如阿比西尼亞的油礦，是成為英意乃至美國爭奪阿國的原因之；德法之爭奪亞爾薩斯羅林與萊因河，乃是因為這些地方產有豐富的煤鐵；如我們要研究這些地方的物產，便非知道其國際關係不可。</p>
<p>像這樣的研究地理，不僅可以獲得有用的地理知識，而且還能使一般知識增加。不說別的，假使你不依此法去研究地理，不知道意大利的國淸如何，英意在東菲在地中海上的關係怎樣，與夫阿比西尼亞的一切情形，那你在報上看到意阿戰爭時也還是不會理解其意義的。由此可見像這樣的研究地理就是對於看報也是有益的。</p>
<p>現在，政治地理學很為人所重視，如各雜誌報章所載的關於什麼地中海，什麼直布羅陀海峽，什麼蘇伊士運河，什麼尼羅河這類文章都司名之為政治地理，最近目有關於政治地理的書籍和地圖的出版。這種地理學，研究起來旣有趣味，不死板，且結果又能得到很多有益的知識，眞比過去那種枯燥無味的地理學要好得多。但這械政治地理學便是以我們上述的研究方法為基礎的地理學。</p>

<h3>談妓女</h3>
<p>— 貴</p>
<p>中國的地面，我走過的很多了。每到一處，無論大小城市或鄉鎭村集，都可見着或多或少的，一些營養不良，睡眠不足的蒼白臉女人，她們不是向別人丟媚眼，便是扭動着肢體賣弄風情，這倒說不上什麼「風流」，「浪漫」，而是滿含着生活的恐慌！這類女人如果也是社會之一員，那麼，在現社會，這樣的人就太多了。這似乎不是一種好現象！</p>

<p>問天下人之貧有貧於湖上笠翁者乎？人皆日有。天下貧者之多，浮於恒河沙數，皆苦於乏恒產，鮮鮮營業，且四方無知瞰，有亦不多，寒乏綈袍之贈，飢無索米之家，此其所以貧也。僕無八口應有之田，而張口受殮者五倍其數，卽有可賣之文，然賣文之錢，亦可指屈而數計矣，以四十口而仰食於一身，是以一桑葉詞百筐之蠶，日生夜長，其何能給？</p>

<p>這類女人因着地域的不同而有各別的名目：如在廣東被稱為「老舉」（譯音），四川叫捨物」，北方叫「婊子」，淮北叫「相公」（此相公非那相公），上海叫「野鷄」。同時又因身價和芳籍不同而有別種　　　如　產的在北方被稱為　條」，廣東叫「車貨」（譯音），淮北叫「土匪」，四川叫「士捧」；身價高的北方稱「姑娘」，廣東稱「小姐」，廣西「稱琵琶仔」，四川稱「玩家」；其餘還有什麼「士帮」，「廣帮」，那也是因地方性質而區分的。名目和等級最多的地方要算上海</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>了，除「書寓」和「云二」不說外，還有什麼「野鷄」，「淌白」，「鹹水妹」，「鹹肉莊」等等；而在別的地方則不過「頭等班子」（又名「長三堂子」），「二等班子」，或「揚帮」，「土帮」這幾種名目而已。</p>
<p>中國的妓女可分為兩大支派，卽「揚州帮」和「蘇州帮」，兩者的歷史都很悠久，牌子也很堅硬。我們在小說上常可見到關於揚州及蘇州妓女的記載，如「浮生六記」的作者沈三自先生在「浪遊記快」中，曾述他在廣州時同一揚帮妓女相好，可見揚州妓女在乾隆時已成了南征的「十字軍」。那時到南方的海路還不通輪，須由安徽江西輾轉前去，道路如此迂迥險阻，尙且有「十字軍」的足跡，則其餘如北方西方更是為她們所征服了。至於蘇帮，也是很早的就向外發展，她們的芳名各省都知道的。不過現在還是要算揚帮的地盤比較廣大，生意比較興隆，差不多各處都有她們的勢力：如珠江流域的兩廣，那裏並沒有蘇帮，而揚帮的勢力却很顯得活躍；偏僻如雲貴川三省，也都有她們的艷幟，不過什這兒不叫揚帮，而稱之曰「下江姑娘」罷了。至於平漢，津浦，隴海三條鐵路所經過的地方，則幾乎全為揚帮所把持，十產的貨色大有陳貨堆積之概。在這些地方，祇要見着一個裝飾入時的女子，你若問她：「你這位姑娘是那兒的？」她必定笑嘻嘻的答復你：「小地方揚州」，問三個，問五個，包是一樣的答復。所謂蘇帮，她們的地盤幾乎縮小到祗有上海，武漢，北平三處，同時這幾個地方還被揚帮及別的份子瓜分一些，但地盤雖小，營業卻很發達，因為這幾個地方都是繁華的大城市，不少千金買笑的豪客，所以比起揚帮來並不算弱小民族。</p>
<p>其實這兩派並沒有多大的分別，拿人來說，都是五官齊全，而生長的地方也沒有相隔很遠，所謂「水色」還是差不多，同時也有本是蘇州籍而列名揚帮的，反過來依然一樣。本來揚帮蘇帮並不完全是揚州蘇州的十產，據我所知：河南的揚帮姑娘，有許多都是湖北人；淮北與揚州相距咫尺，那兒的揚帮中倒有一半是鎭江和安徽人；就是上海的蘇帮，亦有許多是北方人。她們之所以假冒招牌，無非為了發展生意，因為蘇州揚州出美人的傳說流行已久，她們以為頂着這樣的招牌，自已就也有美人的風度，於是你也頂這招牌，我也頂這招牌，弄得全國的娩女都成了蘇帮或楊幫了。</p>
<p>事實完全是這樣的；有了這兩塊招牌，似乎身價也要特別高貴些。除開蘇帮不提，單說揚帮，她們所到的地方，價值總比士帮高昻許多。如像淮北，一般的土娼，夜度資最多祇需四五元（甚至少到八角），而揚幫最少也得十六元，在平漢路，可减少三四元，而士條則祇需一元二元了！至於在兩廣及雲貴四川，土貨更不值錢，而揚帮起碼也得三四十元，而且還要經過「叫條子」，一做花頭」各種手續纔可「落交情」，這些亦需數十元的開銷，合計起來差不多將近一百元了。兩者相比，興有霄壞之別！</p>
<p>然而她們也不能成為資本家，一則由於開銷太大，譬如開碟頭，舖塲面，就要化去很多成本，二乃她們接客的次數很少，一個月能接兩次客都是難得的機會，因為在內地的城市（揚帮跑的地方大都是外碼頭），揮金如土的嫖客究竟很少，兼之幹這生涯的人又多，你搶我奪的競爭甚烈，因而她們的營業近來越發的不行了。去年我在平漢路時知道有幾家揚帮妓院，她們因為接客的次數很少，為了維持開銷，於是向鐵路人員宣傳，自願取消做花頭的手續，減少夜度資，以圖多拉幾個生意，可是結果仍是門前冷落，空勞盼望。有幾家竟因此般碼頭，跑潼關，奔蘭州，希望在那些偏僻地方另謀出路。還有兩家妓院，因為生意不好，鴇兒盡量的虐待妓女，竟弄得跑到「濟良所」請求救濟。淮北的妓女更多，前年大公報的記者說那兒是「娼妓窟」。據我所知，海州城和新浦鎭，單是揚帮便有二百餘名，灌雲縣城（板浦）及所屬的晌水口，墟溝（連雲港在這兒），贛榆的靑浦鎭，各有數十名或百名不等。總之，淮北的揚帮妓女，合計起來總在千人左右，至於土帮，更不可以數計，無論鄉村城市，隨時都能發現許多塗胭脂穿紅衣服的女人，那便都是土娼了。現在洪水差不多已淹沒了整個淮北，慢道揚帮要尋找食料，另開碼頭，就是土帮也要離開故鄉，過那眞正的「江湖生涯」，也許還要借用揚幫這塊招牌呢！惜乎這塊招牌已經破舊，再也不能號召買主了！</p>

<h3>提賑簿（六）</h3>
<p>— 濮漁</p>
<p>「案奉</p>
<p>××省印花菸酒稅局第三五五號訓令開：「案據酒商×××××等具結密報：該分局所轄雙龍鎭元太槽坊，釀酒經月，秘密不報，私行减價銷售當地，妨害同業市塲等情前來，如果不虛，該元太槽坊偷漏國課，藐視稅章，實屬不法已極，而該分局長亦不無失察之咎，除由本局派員密查外，合亟令仰該分局長於文到三日內據實查明呈覆，以憑核辦，切切此令」因：奉此合亟令仰該主任柳皮尅日前往該元太槽坊提取賬簿，查明該坊每日釀酒若干。銷售若干，共數量與銷用之完稅證是否符合，據實呈報來局，以憑核覆，如該元太坊敢於抗不交賬，着由該主任先行將該坊窖口封閉，就近商請當地軍警將該坊主人押送來局……」</p>
<p>我高聲朗誦的讀完聖旨，又把鈐記截蓋的地方給他審視，然後很珍重的把硃單交給老江鎖在皮包裏！</p>
<p>老東西却沒有多大的能耐，這時已嚇得兩眼發楞，全身都在顫動，忠實的面相變成一副可憐的樣兒。我自己暗暗的資備自己，不該這麼過火。然而為了一錢的勾引，又有什麼辦法呢？</p>
<p>這時他在我的眼睛裏恰像一隻負了傷的狗，牠沒有反抗的勇氣，牠怕別人再施攻擊。然而我却更進一步，暗暗給了江錫五一個命令；那小子倒很聰明，馬上抖出威風，擺出吃人的架子：</p>
<p>「喂，李老闆，要面子的，自己把賬簿拿出來。封窖口我可代勞！」</p>
<p>「……！」老頭子哭喪着臉，神經錯亂的望着我。</p>
<p>「快點！公事緊急。」我扳起面孔說了這麼一句，便把右腿蹺在左腿上。</p>
<p>老頭子幾乎吊下眼淚，發了好一會怔，纔半步半步的移到我身邊，癟起嘴巴迸出哭泣似的聲音「主任，請求再商量一下，」他又望一望我的臉色：「我們商人的賬簿一刻不能離掉的，假如提了去，那……名譽，信仰，生意，都要……那個了！就是酒缸也不能對的，如果眞的……那損失就大！」</p>
<p>媽的，還要他說。我早就知道這麼一做，要嚇他一個半死。但是，我還不卽刻鬆手，故意裝出强硬的熊度，操着斬釘截鐵的口氣：</p>
<p>「不行！公事沒有商量的！」</p>
<p>老頭子馬上表現着失望的神色，皺緊眉頭長長一聲　氣。我覺得他正像一隻人東縛住了的狗，我呢，正在準備刀子，慢慢兒放血，剝皮，切肉！</p>
<p>最後談談到「數目』，眞是一塲血戰，我要爭多，老頭子卻哭啼啼的要求减少。他的理由——其實可銳是哀吿；槽坊虧本，開銷太大，沒有亦欵……。我所借故的是：案情重大，非多化錢不得。最後我半威嚇半勸　的說：</p>

<p>我剛說完『斷子絕孫』四個字，心里好像起了一陣寒噤，可恨江錫五那小子『嗤』的一聲笑了出來。媽的的，幾乎把我的臉笑紅了！我狠狠的瞅了他一眼，纔裝着和平的臉色對着老頭子：</p>
<p>「李老闆，我柳某是够朋友的。要帮忙帮到底。但是我，你是知道的，沒有力量貼錢。總之，四百元不多，否則，那就…』下半節話不便肯定的說出來，祗把頭微微的擺了兩擺！（未完）</p>

Let us calculate that since the Sixth Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Executive and Supervisory Committees, the Fifth National Congress has been held in between, and now the First Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Executive Committee has been held. At these meetings, our comrades at home and abroad have gathered together in the spirit of sincere unity and shared national crisis. During the period when we gathered together, the serious incidents in Hebei and Chahar have repeatedly occurred. The government has tried many methods to deal with them in the face of great difficulties. However, our Party still needs to fundamentally implement measures to resolve the national crisis. This Hebei-Chahar incident was something we expected, because we know that the more sincerely united our comrades are, the more severe the difficulties we will encounter. What is needed is that we have a way to resolve the oppression that comes, otherwise the fault that our country bears will be very great. After the closing of the conference today, comrades of our Party should continue to work hard and share the national crisis. Whether central or local, we should be of one mind and one heart, cooperate and divide the work, so that the national crisis can be overcome and the legacy of the Premier can be fully realized. I hope that all comrades will recognize the path to national salvation, make continuous efforts, share the national crisis, and achieve the goal of saving the country. The present speaker has no other opinions to contribute at the time of the closing ceremony today, and I would like to share this with all comrades." (Central News Agency dispatch of the 7th)</p>

This is the result of recent painstaking planning. As for this issue, it is an entire issue of North China internally, and an issue between countries externally, and there are no private opinions involved.

(Central News Agency dispatch of the 7th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Takeashita, head of the Japanese Special Affairs Agency stationed in Yuguan, left Tianjin for Beiping at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 7th. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 7th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The Hebei-Chahar Political Committee will be announced in a few days. The list of members of the committee has not yet been determined. The Garrison Headquarters will be abolished at that time. (Special Dispatch of the 7th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) In the past 24 hours, the authorities have held four important meetings, resulting in a compromise to form a new Hebei-Chahar Administrative Council, with Zhu Zheyuan as the leader. The first meeting was held in Tianjin yesterday. After arriving in Tianjin, Xiao Zhenying immediately discussed with the Japanese side. Xiao returned to Beiping last night and held a meeting with Xiong Shihui, Chen Yi, Qin Dechun, etc. to discuss and report on the negotiations with the Japanese side in Tianjin. This morning, Xiao went to the Summer Palace to meet Song Zheyuan and returned to Beiping at noon. He also held a meeting with Chen Yi, Xiong Shihui, etc. at He Yingqin's residence until 3:00 PM. Reuters learned from reliable sources that the new Hebei-Chahar Administrative Council, in addition to Song Zheyuan as the leader, will also recruit some military and political leaders from the Beijing government era. It is also heard that after the establishment of the new administrative council, the Beiping-Tianjin Garrison Headquarters will be abolished. Reuters also learned that Japanese Commander Tada and Shi Feiyuan strongly support this plan, so the Japanese side is unlikely to create further obstacles. This is why there are no Japanese aircraft flying in the sky over Beiping today. The remarks made by the Japanese military spokesman this afternoon, when this compromise was not yet known to the public, seemed quite meaningful. The spokesman said that he now believes that He Yingqin agrees with the method proposed by Song Zheyuan to resolve the situation in North China. When the new plan is established in the future, it will be in the form of autonomy, and will be presided over by some former northern personnel. What the Japanese authorities are concerned about is the policy of the new organization, not the content of its organization. He expects it to be a pro-Japanese and anti-communist policy. There were two suggestions, one advocating including five provinces, and the other advocating two provinces. He believes that the latter is better. (Reuters dispatch of the 7th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xiao Zhenying, Xiong Shihui, Qin Dechun, and Chen Yi returned from the Summer Palace tonight, but they were all unwilling to meet with Chinese and foreign journalists. Chinese reporters went to the Summer Palace, but were not received by Song Zheyuan. However, he instructed them to see Xiao Zhenying. After returning to the city, Xiao was still unwilling to make any announcements, only telling reporters that he was busy attending a banquet with Chinese and Japanese officials participating in the negotiations and could not meet them. The reporters then went to He Yingqin's residence. Although He did not come out to meet them, one of his entourage came out to deal with the reporters and admitted that there was a concrete plan, but refused to announce its contents. It is generally believed that Nanjing has agreed to this plan. After this news came out, people's hearts were greatly relieved. It is rumored that He will return to Nanjing in a few days. (Reuters dispatch of the 7th)</p>

<h3>America's Five-Year Air Force Plan</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Since the end of the European War, those who speak of international politics and military affairs have predicted a second world war. The location will be in the Pacific Ocean, and the tool will be the air force. Observing the recent evolution of relations between countries in the Pacific region, one feels that this statement is credible and well-founded. As representatives from Britain, the United States, and other countries gather in Britain to discuss naval disarmament, the United States Congress is drafting a five-year air force plan. Its content is to build 800 military aircraft annually and raise funds to realize the "Wilcox's Great Air Defense Plan." Japan has insisted on its demand for naval equality, so the United States has adopted a realistic attitude to deal with it. The so-called five-year air force plan is not just empty words and threats to Japan.</p>
<p>If the Pacific is unfortunately at war, the United States will feel at a disadvantage in terms of terrain by naval warfare. The area of war will definitely be in the waters near the Philippine Islands in the Western Pacific, where naval battles are most likely to occur. The US fleet, coming from San Francisco and Hawaii, will be a tired and long-distance expedition, while the Japanese fleet will be waiting comfortably. Judging from the precedent of the failure of the Russian Baltic Fleet in the Russo-Japanese War, the US naval authorities cannot be without concern. This is one reason. From the United States to East Asia, there are no large naval ports except for Honolulu. Refueling and repairs are inconvenient. Although Samoa in the South Pacific has facilities, they are very simple. Therefore, once the United States fights a strong enemy in this vast and homeless sea, it will feel difficult. This is the second reason. The Caroline Islands of Japan are lined up in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, and the situation is extremely dangerous. There are many submarines. Utilizing the terrain of the sea, they can effectively carry out unexpected sneak attacks on the huge warships of the United States. Moreover, Japan has already made arrangements on the islands. This is the third reason.</p>
<p>If there is a war between Japan and the United States, the United States will benefit from taking the offensive. At the beginning of the war, it would destroy Japan's industrial and political centers, so that the soldiers on the front lines would lose contact with the rear and have no courage to fight. To achieve this goal, the air force is far better than the navy. The US Air Force, in terms of technology, ability, quantity, and quality, is beyond what Japan can match. Moreover, the US aircraft industry and steel manufacturing industry are developed, its financial resources are abundant, and its technology and science are progressing rapidly. The potential strength of its air force is several times that of Japan. Most of the cities in Japan are composed of wooden houses, which are easy to burn. The Japanese warships are smaller in tonnage and have thinner armor, making them easier to destroy. The air force can come and go freely, unlike the navy, which requires a large amount of supplies and a huge base. The distance from the Aleutian Islands to the Japanese mainland is shorter. Aircraft attacks are easier to achieve results. This is why the US national defense plan pays attention to the air force, and why Japan regards this as a problem in the heart and abdomen.</p>
<p>Before the Washington Conference, Japan wantonly invaded the East Asian continent. The US government believed that it could not be stopped by mere words, so it proposed a large naval plan. Therefore, Japan was able to slightly change its attitude at the Washington Conference. Now, the London Naval Conference has opened. What kind of effect will the US five-year air force plan have in diplomacy? This is a truly interesting question at present.</p>

<h3>Dissolution of Fascist Issue: Laval Wins Again; Vote of Confidence in the Chamber Exceeds Expectations</h3>
<p>(Paris) After a heated debate in the Chamber today on the proposal to dissolve fascist and other organizations with armed groups, a vote of confidence in the government passed in the afternoon by a margin of 351 to 219. This is the third time that Premier Laval has successfully weathered a difficult situation in nine days. Although today's result was expected, the support that Laval received was greater than anticipated, which is welcome. Previously, Socialist leader Leon Blum and Croix-de-Feu leader de La Rocque both stated their willingness to dissolve the "defense organizations" within their parties. Laval seized the opportunity to introduce several bills aimed at implementing their assurances. The bills prohibited the presence of armed units within parties, although those approved by the authorities could remain. They also stipulated that anyone making an unwarranted display of arms would be sentenced to up to two years in prison and fined. Uniforms of unauthorized groups, including the Algerian, would be confiscated. Both French and foreigners would be prohibited from carrying weapons, with violators facing up to two years in prison. Regarding news censorship that incites assassination, which under current law only applies to anarchists, it will now be extended to any form of incitement. The French franc rose sharply today because the public believes that Laval's government will remain stable after this test. (Reuters Dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After passing the vote of confidence last night, the Chamber discussed and passed the three bills proposed by Laval. The meeting adjourned at 2:30 a.m. The first bill concerned the dissolution of paramilitary societies. The Socialist Party amended it to prohibit the wearing of uniforms or badges that indicate membership in private groups. The second bill stipulated that any citizen demonstrating with weapons or entering a meeting place with weapons could be sentenced to imprisonment from three months to two years. Foreigners who violate this provision, along with their families, will be deported. The third bill concerned news censorship that incites unrest. (Reuters Dispatch on the 7th)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt Announces for the First Time Specific U.S. Policies for Ending War; Neutral Policy Is Not Standing Idly By; More Efforts to Maintain Peace Than Other Countries</h3>

The Archbishop of Alba had written to the President, stating that the United States should not stand idly by in the Italo-Ethiopian War and allow the world to decline, so the President responded with this letter. The President's expression of his attitude towards sanctions is a first. (Reuters Dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<h3>Washington Newspaper Praises the Anglo-American Statement; Timely Advice to Japan</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Washington Star evening newspaper published an article praising the statements made yesterday by U.S. Secretary of State Hull and British Foreign Secretary Hoare, considering them a timely warning to Japan that Western countries are not neglecting other issues due to their attention to the Abyssinian problem. The experience gained by Mussolini should be enough to make Japan realize that large-scale aggression can no longer be ignored by the world. (National News Agency Dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Observers today believe that the statements made yesterday by U.S. Secretary of State Hull and British Foreign Secretary Hoare are an implied warning to Japan, urging them to be careful to avoid becoming the second target in the world peace movement. It is believed here that the timing of the statement, just before the opening of the naval conference, is of particular importance. The British and American authorities are not concealing the active participation of Japanese soldiers in the autonomous movement in North China. (National News Agency Dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) U.S. Secretary of State Hull's statement on the North China incident has attracted international attention.

<h3>Eve of the Naval Conference Opening; Comparison of the Policies of Five Countries; British Naval Chief of Staff Meets with Japanese Representatives</h3>
<p>(London) The British Chief of Naval Staff, Admiral Chatfield, recently met at the Admiralty with the Japanese representative to the naval conference, Admiral Nagano, and former Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Nagai, as well as Iwashita Terazaki, a member of the Japanese delegation. British naval expert Sir Herbert Richmond and the Director of the American Department of the Foreign Office, Craigie, were also present. It is reported that the British and Japanese representatives discussed the procedural issues of the naval conference. These procedural issues will also be discussed by Naval Minister Monsell when he meets with the representatives of the United States, France, and Italy tomorrow afternoon. Furthermore, the French delegation held a meeting at the French Embassy this morning, chaired by the French Ambassador to the UK, Goulin, who is also the chief representative to the conference. The current situation was discussed at the meeting. (Havas Dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>(London) With the London Naval Conference about to open, representatives from various countries have arrived one after another. The following is a summary of the positions of the United Kingdom, Japan, the United States, France, and Italy, as ascertained by our reporters.</p>
<p>(1) The United Kingdom's position is based on setting qualitative restrictions for various classes of warships. However, if the countries cannot agree on the figures proposed by the United Kingdom, they can be modified. (A) Regarding the tonnage of various classes of warships, the British Admiralty proposes that the tonnage of battleships be limited to 25,000 tons, but if necessary, it can be revised to a maximum tonnage of 35,000 tons, as suggested by the United States. The tonnage of cruisers should be limited to 7,000 tons, aircraft carriers to 22,000 tons, and destroyers to 1,500 tons. At the same time, it also advocates the complete abolition of submarines. (B) Regarding the caliber of guns for various classes of warships, the United Kingdom proposes that the caliber of battleship guns be limited to 12 inches, and cruisers to 6 inches.</p>
<p>(2) Japan advocates abolishing capital ships or substantially reducing the number and tonnage of capital ships. In addition, it advocates abolishing 10,000-ton class cruisers and reducing the tonnage of cruisers, because Japan considers both capital ships and 10,000-ton class cruisers to be offensive weapons. As for submarine fleets, Japan believes they are defensive weapons and insists on retaining them.</p>
<p>(3) The United States, in contrast to Japan's position, strongly desires to maintain its capital ship and big gun doctrine, which it has always upheld. It argues that the minimum tonnage for battleships should be 35,000 tons and does not seem to insist much on the tonnage of cruisers, but if it is limited to 7,000 tons, it will definitely not accept it. As for Japan's demand for equality, it cannot be accepted by the United States.</p>
<p>(4) Although France and Italy are both prepared to accept the agreement on restrictions, they are unwilling to abandon the two 35,000-ton battleships they are currently building. Both countries also advocate maintaining submarines. It is also reported that the Italian delegation is now trying to avoid disputes with France. As for the neutralization of the Mediterranean Sea and the Strait of Gibraltar, they do not intend to make demands. In addition, the French Admiralty, considering the country's relatively long overseas colonial transportation lines, argues that the country's naval power should exceed that of any other continental European country. Furthermore, since the Anglo-German naval agreement was concluded, Germany's naval power will follow British naval policy and increase accordingly (35 percent). As a result, France's naval power will also increase accordingly, and Germany will also definitely follow France's shipbuilding policy, even for 35,000-ton battleships. This is because of the Anglo-German naval agreement, and it is the difficulty facing the naval conference. (Havas Dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government has decided on its countermeasures for the disarmament conference. It will first decide on the method of arms reduction, based on the qualitative restrictions agreed upon and other related issues. It then instructed the resident British representatives to advocate at the conference that the principle of disarmament should be discussed first. According to a report from Fujii, the acting ambassador to the UK, the conference will establish a committee of plenipotentiaries from various countries to seek a breakthrough in reaching a principled understanding. Therefore, it is still doubtful whether the UK and the United States will agree. It is also possible that Japan and the UK and the United States will start discussions on qualitative issues at the beginning of the conference. (Japan United Press Dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Official sources here have remained silent regarding the statement made by the spokesperson of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs that Japan intends to abandon the Nine-Power Treaty relating to China. However, private sources are expressing considerable doubt about Japan's statement. The official unwillingness to comment is due to the fact that the Japanese spokesperson was speaking in a personal capacity and said that Japan does not wish to take any action on this matter at present. Responsible parties believe that this statement is a probe or a diplomatic tactic for the naval conference. (National News Agency Dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>(London) After arriving here, the U.S. delegation to the Naval Conference had dinner at their hotel last night. They do not intend to meet with any naval representatives from the UK or other countries before the opening of the Naval Conference. Its chief delegate, Norman Davis, also does not intend to issue any statements on the upcoming discussions before the formal conference. The delegation currently believes that the conference will be lengthy. According to observations by Americans here, the outcome of the Naval Conference is not very optimistic, as there are two major obstacles ahead. One is that the current general situation is sufficient to have an adverse impact on the progress of the conference, and the other is that there is no unanimous agreement among the countries concerned on the principle of the tonnage ratio of major naval powers, which will inevitably hinder the establishment of a naval agreement. (Havas Dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>(London) Admiral Bini, Rear Admiral Piccia, and experts from the Italian delegation to the Naval Conference arrived here at 5:20 p.m. this afternoon. Rear Admiral de Gueux, Colonel Deporcain, Captain Berger, and experts from the French delegation also arrived on the same train as the Italian representatives. (Havas Dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>(London) The London Naval Conference is scheduled to open within days. According to the observations of a Havas reporter, the biggest obstacle facing the Naval Conference is the conflict between the views of the United States and Japan. If the Japanese representatives insist on naval equality as a prerequisite for discussing all issues, it is feared that the Naval Conference will immediately reach a stalemate after it opens. As for the UK, it will probably try to reconcile and propose to discuss various specific technical issues first, so that the Naval Conference can proceed in an orderly manner without wasting time. However, no matter how hard the UK tries, the main issues caused by the abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty will inevitably be raised at the Naval Conference sooner or later. It is expected that the discussion will involve the political aspects of the Pacific region, as the United States wants to build new military bases on the main transportation routes in the Far East, while Japan will definitely oppose it. Therefore, the Naval Conference will inevitably discuss the balance of power in the Far East. (Havas Dispatch on the 6th)</p>

The northern route is the most popular. (Reuters Dispatch on the 6th)</p>

<h3>Abyssinian Emperor Protests Italian Aircraft Bombings - League of Nations to Implement Oil Embargo Early - Italian Aircraft Bomb Taisi for Second Time - Previous Bombing Caused Hundreds of Casualties</h3>
<p>(Geneva) It is rumored here that the Italian aircraft bombing of Taisi will accelerate the League of Nations' oil embargo against Italy. It is expected that the 48-nation committee meeting next week will be brief and the resolution to adopt the oil embargo will receive unanimous support. The implementation of the oil embargo will not be delayed much. (7th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to sources in the League of Nations, the kerosene embargo will be announced before the New Year. Therefore, political activities regarding the Italian-Abyssinian conflict will soon be intensified. Sir Drummond, the British Ambassador to Italy, met with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini this morning to gauge Mussolini's intentions so that British Foreign Secretary Hoare could ascertain Italy's political stance before meeting with French Prime Minister Laval in the afternoon. He also advised Mussolini to use moderate language when addressing the Chamber of Deputies. In addition, Mr. Vasconcelos, Chairman of the Eighteen-Nation Committee, told reporters that Hoare and Laval were likely to discuss the implementation date of the kerosene embargo at their meeting today.

<p>Ottawa – Canadian Prime Minister King announced today that his government's statement on the oil embargo refers to its origin and does not involve its merits. Canada's attitude towards the League of Nations has not changed. Canada will still support the League of Nations if it imposes an oil embargo and implements other sanctions, but the phrase "Canadian motion" will no longer be used. (7th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Abyssinian Emperor sent a personal telegram to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, strongly protesting against the Italian aircraft bombing of undefended towns, villages, and hospitals. He stated that representatives of major British and American newspapers could prove the bombing of the American hospital in Taisi, and he personally witnessed the tragic death of a woman and two children. The hospital suffered significant damage and prominently displayed the Red Cross flag, which Italian aircraft should have been able to see. (7th Reuters)</p>
<p>Taisi – An Associated Press reporter's investigation today revealed that 53 people were killed and 200 injured in the Italian bombing of this place. Many of the injured suffered from missing limbs. Doctors were busy amputating broken limbs. One of the injured was a Swiss nurse, whose leg had been amputated. In addition, dozens of women and children were injured. Italian aircraft did not attack the Abyssinian army stationed in the suburbs, which strengthens the belief that the Italian aircraft's target was the Abyssinian Emperor. (6th Guomin News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa – The people of Addis Ababa were greatly angered after hearing the news of the Italian aircraft bombing of the undefended town of Taisi yesterday. At the same time, they were overjoyed that the Abyssinian Emperor had escaped unharmed. It is reported that the Emperor had ordered the city to be equipped with anti-aircraft guns for defense. Italian aircraft attacked three times yesterday, with a total of nine aircraft dropping approximately 1,000 incendiary and explosive bombs. Thirty-two people were killed and 200 injured. The Emperor personally aimed and fired at the enemy aircraft. The Emperor was standing in his imperial garden at the time, and although bombs exploded near him, he remained calm. One bomb exploded less than fifteen feet away, injuring several soldiers, but the Emperor was unharmed. The American hospital that was hit was run by an American church. One Norwegian nurse was injured and had a leg broken. The people in the hospital had evacuated a few minutes before the enemy aircraft appeared. The hospital's office was destroyed, and beds, surgical instruments, surgical tables, and other equipment were scattered all over the ground. There was also other damage. Rumors circulated that one enemy aircraft had been shot down, but this could not be confirmed. Many people in Addis Ababa feel that the war has truly begun. At the same time, according to unconfirmed reports, fierce fighting is taking place in Duolo, near Magaal. (7th Reuters)</p>
<p>(New York) News received here from Addis Ababa states that Italian aircraft attacked the town of Taisi yesterday, and a bomb hit a hospital run by an American church, injuring one American nurse. The hospital was completely destroyed, and medicines and equipment were scattered in all directions, making it extremely difficult to treat the wounded. Abyssinian people, whose homes were destroyed, cursed the white people indiscriminately, apparently not distinguishing between Italians and other foreigners. (7th Reuters)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa – It was officially announced here today that fierce fighting had taken place fifteen miles south of Duolo, with heavy losses on both sides. Today, Italian forces bombed Gondar for the second time, killing four women and two children. The troops under General Aliyu and General Imanu were attacked by bombs and machine guns. Italian aircraft also attacked Meking Gao and Ositelosa. Italian military aircraft flew over Harar and Angor, but did not drop bombs, although it is predicted that Jijjiga, Harar, and Addis Ababa will eventually be attacked. It is reported that Italian forces are currently advancing on Taikazi. (6th Guomin News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa – Italian aircraft bombed the town of Taisi again today. Details are unknown. It is reported that Gonda, a key city in northwestern Abyssinia, was also bombed by Italian aircraft, killing four women and four children and injuring another twenty people. Italian aircraft dropped a total of 178 bombs. According to an official report signed by seven doctors at the American hospital in Taisi, when twelve Italian aircraft attacked Taisi yesterday, the American hospital was their primary target, and bombs rained down. At the same time, former commander-in-chief of the Italian forces in East Africa, General De Bono, stated in the Roman Gazette today that Italian reconnaissance aircraft had flown over tens of thousands of armed Abyssinian camps near Taisi. Although Italian aircraft were heavily bombarded by Abyssinian anti-aircraft guns, they bombed the enemy camps with great effect. (7th Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) The Chronicle reported that one of the bombs dropped by Italian aircraft landed less than fifteen feet away from Abyssinian soldiers, and these Abyssinian soldiers were only six feet away from the Emperor. The Emperor then returned fire with anti-aircraft guns. As soon as he heard the sound of a bomber, he rushed to the anti-aircraft gun to fire. Soldiers tried to cover the Emperor's shoulders with a cloth to avoid making him a target, but the Emperor ignored them and continued to open fire next to Michael.

<h3>1,500 Kilometers Apart - Indirect Negotiations Between Britain, France, and Italy - Hoare and Laval Meet in Paris - Mussolini Addresses the Chamber of Deputies - Prospects for Italian-Abyssinian Peace Improve Again</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Foreign Ministers of Britain, France, and Italy held talks today. However, the Italian Foreign Minister, Prime Minister Mussolini, was 1,500 kilometers away from the British and French Foreign Ministers. This form of long-distance indirect talks is unprecedented in diplomatic history. This morning, British Foreign Secretary Hoare arrived here and agreed to meet with Prime Minister Laval in the afternoon, after Prime Minister Mussolini's broadcast address in Rome concluded. This allowed Hoare and Laval to fully understand the content of Mussolini's speech before their meeting. Mussolini met with British Ambassador to Italy, Sir Drummond, this morning to discuss matters. The so-called triangular British-French-Italian diplomatic talks were thus realized. According to what this newspaper's correspondent has learned, the diplomatic talks between Britain, France, and Italy, which began today, are in a better situation than the gloomy outlook generally expected in recent days. Italy had previously stated that it would refuse mediation efforts by Britain and France, and had threatened that while Italy could consider suggestions from other countries, it would not make any new suggestions itself. At that time, diplomatic circles and Italian public opinion spread alarming news that a European war was about to break out. Now, it seems that Britain and France are no longer insisting that Italy automatically make new suggestions, so the situation has become more moderate, and the Italian government's firm attitude is not as severe as previously imagined, which is somewhat satisfactory. (7th Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval is scheduled to meet with British Foreign Secretary Hoare at 5:30 PM. According to what this newspaper's diplomatic correspondent has learned, Italian Ambassador Cerruti reiterated the seriousness of the kerosene embargo to Laval this morning. The French Foreign Ministry believes that the kerosene embargo can only be delayed if Italy changes its attitude and strives for peace. However, according to what this newspaper's correspondent has learned, Hoare and Laval believe that Italy's intentions are extremely difficult to grasp, so the joint British-French plan to resolve the Italian-Abyssinian dispute may be decided at a later date. (7th Havas)</p>
<p>(London) When British Foreign Secretary Hoare meets with French Prime Minister Laval in Paris today, British Under-Secretary Vansittart will also be present. He has arrived in Paris. Before leaving London yesterday, he had talks with the French and Italian Ambassadors. It is reported that although British and French experts have not yet completed their peace proposals, they will report the results of their discussions to Hoare and Laval tomorrow. It is now hoped that the two officials will be able to agree on a concrete plan to submit to Italy and Abyssinia. At present, there is no indication that the Italian government is prepared to start negotiations on terms that the British and French governments would consider appropriate. (7th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Rome) Mussolini decided to address the Chamber of Deputies at 3:00 PM today, and it will be translated into 17 languages and broadcast worldwide. The Italian people are now waiting for the Prime Minister to announce his attitude towards the Abyssinian war and the League of Nations' sanctions. It is reported that the content of Mussolini's speech will be both firm and moderate. (7th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Italian Chamber of Deputies Autumn Session Opens - Mussolini Speaks - Says Overall Situation Slightly Improved</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Chamber of Deputies held its autumn session this afternoon. When Mussolini attended the opening ceremony, he spoke and ridiculed France's participation in the sanctions against Italy. Before the opening, the entire chamber sang patriotic songs. At 2:00 PM, Mussolini entered the chamber, and everyone stood up and cheered. More than 400 deputies attended, all wearing black uniforms. Only the 43 deputies serving in East Africa were absent. Mussolini spoke about the sanctions, saying that the overall situation has now improved slightly. The proposed sanctions may be slightly relaxed, but deputies should not be too optimistic. The Italian government was previously asked to state its immutable needs, and it notified the French government of this in October. Unexpectedly, the countries did not offer suggestions but retaliated with sanctions. Mussolini then referred to the talks between British and French experts in Paris, saying that there was no reason to believe that they would reach a quick resolution. Then, Speaker Count Ciano announced the opening of the meeting and said that all Italian people were determined to resist unfair sanctions, so they were now contributing all their gold to the country. The deputies were also willing to hand over all their gold medals. Ciano then drew the deputies' attention to the fact that Mussolini had handed over all his medals except the one he won for the "March on Rome." Mussolini also handed over his steel helmet to be reforged into pure steel. Then, the deputies walked to the ballot box and put their medals into a box. The French and American Ambassadors were seated in the diplomatic gallery, but the British Ambassador was not seen. Hours before the opening, the public gallery was already full. (7th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian Chamber of Deputies held a meeting this afternoon. Prime Minister Mussolini entered the chamber at 3:00 PM, and all the deputies, dressed in black shirts, applauded and cheered for the Prime Minister. Slogans were written all over the podium, listing the names of the countries participating in the sanctions. Mussolini then delivered a speech, stating that the international situation was unlikely to improve. The Italian people should not be overly optimistic. As for the British and French experts who are holding talks in Paris, they are not formal negotiations. Mussolini then reiterated his opposition to sanctions and said that British Foreign Secretary Hoare's speech in the House of Commons, which said that "Britain deeply wishes Italy to have a strong and capable government," was ironic, as Italy had been working hard for fourteen years to create a strong and capable government. The final conclusion of the Italian Prime Minister's speech was: "I hereby solemnly declare that unless Italy's rights are recognized and Italy's interests in Africa are guaranteed, there can be no true right or wrong. Italy, on the one hand, is justified and, on the other hand, must continue to act in Italy and Africa. The Italian army and the Blackshirts, on expedition in Africa, will undoubtedly win victory for the motherland." (7th Havas)</p>
<h3>Mussolini Receives British and French Ambassadors - Laval Also Receives Representatives from Various Countries</h3>
<p>(Rome) British Ambassador to Italy Sir Drummond called on Italian Prime Minister Mussolini today for half an hour. It is said that their discussion focused on today's meeting between French Prime Minister Laval and British Foreign Secretary Hoare. As a result of this conversation, Mussolini may change his remarks in the Chamber of Deputies this afternoon. (7th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini met with British Ambassador Sir Drummond and French Ambassador Chambrun this morning. It is generally believed that the talks involved discussions on the talks to be held in Paris this afternoon by British Foreign Secretary Hoare and French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval, and that they also touched on the speech that the Italian Prime Minister plans to deliver in the Chamber of Deputies. (7th Havas)</p>
<p>(London) According to well-informed sources, British Ambassador to Italy Drummond visited Italian Prime Minister Mussolini this morning for the purpose of personally delivering the full text of Foreign Secretary Hoare's speech in the House of Commons on the 5th of this month and making another appeal for peace to Italy. The results of Drummond's visit to the Italian Prime Minister have not yet been notified to London, but it is heard that they have been notified to Paris immediately, so that Hoare can learn the details before meeting with French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval. (7th Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval met with various diplomatic representatives this morning, including Italian Ambassador to France Cerruti, Abyssinian representative Professor Seize, US Ambassador Straus, Yugoslavian Minister Breic, Canadian Minister Durrant, and Chilean representative to the League of Nations Iguana.

<h3>Britain Plans to Increase Naval Bases in the Mediterranean - Malta Easily Threatened by Air Force</h3>
<p>(London) It was learned here today that France has diplomatically notified the British government that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has rejected the British and French peace proposals. As a result, the nature of the meeting between British Foreign Secretary Hoare and French Prime Minister Laval in Paris is likely to change significantly. Hoare will devote all his efforts to strengthening the common British-French front in order to cope with the increasingly serious situation in Europe, and will urge Laval to fully cooperate in implementing sanctions against Italy. Diplomats here stated today that the East African war is likely to continue, and the League of Nations' sanctions are bound to be strengthened. Today, rumors spread that Mussolini will sever diplomatic relations with countries implementing sanctions in response to the oil embargo. Britain is currently conducting secret negotiations, hoping to expand its bases in the Mediterranean. (6th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) It was learned from reliable sources today that when Prince Paul of Yugoslavia visited London in November, he discussed the construction of a British naval base on the Yugoslav coast. Britain is now also hoping to carry out the same defense measures on the Balearic Islands of Spain, and intends to assist Greece in opening up Navarino and other military ports. The Admiralty believes that the island of Malta is too dangerous and insufficient as a base for naval activity, as it only takes half an hour to fly there from Italy. (7th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) According to speculation from London, Rome, and Paris, Prime Minister Mussolini's remarks this afternoon will hinder the recent peace process. The London Daily Mail's editorial today stated that Mussolini has already taken this action. He has declared to French Prime Minister Laval that he must oppose the cession of the Ogaden region to Abyssinia, and he is unwilling to consider negotiations involving Abyssinian affairs. It is heard that Mussolini will declare that Italy will sever diplomatic relations with countries that approve the oil embargo before Laval and Hoare meet. At the same time, a dispatch from the Abyssinian war zone received here stated that the Italian army's bombing of Taisi and Gondar yesterday has hardened Abyssinian emotions and intensified the desire for revenge. German General Goering spoke last night, wishing that God would not allow the current tense situation to eventually lead to a European war, and said that the possibility of the spread of war makes it impossible for the Germans not to be prepared. When the Archbishop of York, Dr. Temple, arrived in New York yesterday, he spoke of the international situation, saying that the world may need to have another terrible war to establish the authority of the League of Nations. From these remarks, it can be seen the general anxiety of the people. (7th Reuters)</p>

<h3>The Face of a Clock (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Feng Zikai</p>
<p>People living in the present era probably look at the face of a clock more often than they look at the faces of their superiors, bosses, friends, or lovers. Students, teachers, workers, shop assistants, people in post offices, people in train stations… who doesn't look at the face of a clock several times a day? Even those who live secluded lives, enjoying comfort and luxury, those of noble birth and wealth, who have others attend to their every need, cannot help but constantly observe the expression on the clock's face. It is a reasonable request to hope that the appearance of this face, which is constantly seen by so many eyes every day, becomes more pleasing. I remember when we first saw it, its face was marked with delicate Roman numerals. The many radiating lines created a sense of both pattern and numerical significance. Although intricate, it was gentle and refined, with a distinctly antique style. I can't recall in which century it was born in the West, but I know that Matteo Ricci brought it to China during the Wanli reign of the Ming Dynasty (late 16th century). So, I assume it was a product of the 16th century or earlier. Roman numerals were probably its original appearance? Because the delicate radiating lines and elegant patterned style remind me of the artistic forms of the Renaissance and the court art era. About thirty years ago, when we were children, its face was still marked with Roman numerals; later, it suddenly transformed, and all clocks, large and small, had Arabic numerals inscribed on their faces. I don't know when this trend started, or in which country or by whom it was created, as I am not a scholar of arts and crafts. But one can imagine that this is a manifestation of the "utilitarianism" of the late 19th century, an expression of "intellectualism" in arts and crafts. Because using 12345, etc., with rectangles as the basic form and strokes of varying complexity, to adorn the circumference of a circle, and making each one face me, though there are conveniences in terms of practicality and intellectual perception, the form inevitably suffers from a sense of "awkwardness." Especially the rectangular watches that are popular among women now: because of the forced attempt to fit the four sides of a rectangle to the circular motion of the hands, the size and spacing of the Arabic numerals become uneven, resulting in an awkward expression. Now that I think about it, when I disliked the faces of clocks and painted them over, though it was an act of curiosity, it was probably also partly due to their awkward expressions.</p>
<p>The clock with Arabic numerals has been showing its awkward face to the world for several decades now. There must be sensitive artists and craftsmen who dislike it, hence the emergence of the Art Nouveau style clock. "Simple and clear" is the aesthetic form demanded by modern sensibility. Furniture with carved dragons and phoenixes has now been replaced by glass tables and steel tube chairs. Sumptuous palaces have now been replaced by glass houses, skyscrapers, and steamboat-style buildings. All kinds of arts and crafts have followed this trend towards "simplicity and clarity," and this clock can be said to be one of its pioneers. Speaking of its advantages, first: clocks have been in use for a long time, and we are very familiar with the parts of its face. Therefore, using only a line to indicate the hour, without numerals, is beneficial to the form without hindering practicality. Second: using a line to indicate the hour, because of its small footprint and uniformity, the distance between every five minutes is very clear, much clearer than Roman numerals, much clearer than Arabic numerals. We can see the minutes correctly at a glance. Third: the hands are free of decorative patterns (the hands of old-fashioned clocks were curved on both sides, with a circle at the tip, and sometimes a ruyi-shaped tassel was attached below the circle), its indication is direct, swift, frank, and clear, unlike the rambling of old-fashioned hands. —In these three points, I praise the face of the new clock. But I cannot determine that this is the most reasonable form of clock in terms of overall progress; I just think it looks better than one with Arabic numerals. I also cannot determine that this face can please everyone; I just feel that at least it can provide comfort to the vision of some people. I said "everyone," which is really too careless! In the interior of our country, in the vast and remote countryside, there are still countless people who have never seen the face of a clock! Night of December 3rd</p>

<h3>Song Zheyuan Goes to Tangshan for Rest; Japanese Planes Fly Over Beiping for Reconnaissance for Days</h3>
<p>Beiping Dispatch: The situation in North China, since He Yingqin arrived in Beiping, has been discussed in detail with the Beiping-Tianjin authorities every day. Song Zheyuan, due to the mental fatigue of dealing with the situation in recent months, went to the Xiyuan at 11:00 AM on the 5th from his private residence in Wuyiku Hutong to inspect Feng Zhian's troops. At 1:00 PM, he went to Tangshan for rest and had not returned as of the 6th. Before leaving, he issued a written statement stating, "The precarious and turbulent situation in North China, since Minister He came to Beiping to coordinate the overall plan, there is hope for a turn for the better. Moreover, Minister He has met with Chairman Han (Fuju) and Chairman Shang (Zhen), and has a genuine understanding of the actual situation in North China, so a complete solution can naturally be obtained. From now on, all difficult problems should be handled under the responsibility of Minister He."</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of stabilizing the situation in North China, internal contacts have been emphasized in recent days. Chen Yi and Xiong Shihui, who accompanied He Yingqin to Beiping, only had a private meeting with a certain important Japanese figure in Beiping once. Formal contacts have not yet begun. In order to quickly centralize internal opinions, He summoned Chen, Xiong, Qin Dechun, Xiao Zhenying, and others again at Jurren Hall at noon on the 5th for a meeting, the result of which was satisfactory. He will remain in Beiping temporarily to handle everything. A certain important Japanese figure once expressed to a certain individual, roughly stating that they do not intend to insist on preconceived notions regarding the North China issue, but recently there has been a change in attitude, roughly stating that the solution should not deviate far from the spirit of their proposed plan. Therefore, the focus of discussion among all parties in recent days has been on this point. Song Zheyuan, because his personal responsibility has been reduced since He Yingqin came north, and at the same time, the Beiping-Tianjin Garrison Headquarters has received orders from the central government to prepare for dissolution, hopes to end it as soon as possible. On the 5th, he sent Qin Su to see He to express this intention politely. A Japanese reconnaissance plane, all silver-gray, without a number, carrying a Japanese officer, flew from Chengde via Tongzhou to Nanyuan at 12:20 PM on the 5th and landed. Then, at 1:00 PM, it took off again from Xiyuan, circled over the city of Beiping, and scattered leaflets. At 1:30 PM, it flew back to Tianjin. At that time, another Japanese reconnaissance plane flew from the Dongjuzi Japanese airfield in Tianjin and circled over the city of Beiping for about ten minutes. Then, three more Japanese reconnaissance planes flew from Tianjin, and after another ten minutes, five more Japanese planes arrived. At 1:50 PM, nine Japanese planes gathered over the city of Beiping, divided into three rows, each with three planes, circled and flew over the central area of the city for about twenty minutes, and flew back to Tianjin at about 3:00 PM. Also, Japanese plane No. 23, piloted by a Japanese named Yuta, carrying a person in civilian clothes, flew from Tianjin to Nanyuan at 3:20 PM on the afternoon of the 10th. The Japanese are building a new airfield near Liminzhuang near Dongjuzi in Tianjin, which has been actively built by the Japanese army with aviation troops. All work was completed on the 5th. The airfield occupies more than 1,300 mu of land and can accommodate 30 aircraft. Kubota, the chief of staff of the Japanese Lushun Naval Base, is scheduled to arrive in Tianjin on the 7th to set up a Tianjin office. A Japanese plane flew over the city of Tianjin at 10:00 AM on the 5th for reconnaissance. "Three Jidong green planes scattered various leaflets over the city of Tianjin at 2:00 PM. Also, nine Japanese planes flew to Beiping from Tianjin successively at 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 5th and returned to Tianjin at about 4:00 PM." (6th)</p>
<h3>Tianjin Issues Copper Coin Notes</h3>
<p>Temporarily Issued by the Provincial Bank as a Circulating Fund The Construction Department Asks Officials to Stabilize Prices</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The issuance of Tianjin copper coin notes was realized on the 5th. According to central government orders, the issuance of copper coin notes does not require additional preparations and has been assigned to the Beiping Agricultural and Industrial Bank under the Finance Department. The order has arrived in Tianjin, but the Beiping Agricultural and Industrial Bank is hesitant and watching due to the time required for preparation and the current precarious situation in Hebei. However, Tianjin, due to the absorption and manipulation of various unscrupulous merchants in the concessions, has a sluggish market circulation, and the people's livelihood is becoming increasingly strained. If issuance is not expedited, unexpected riots may occur. Therefore, the City Chamber of Commerce, the Nine Districts Construction Office, and the Silver and Money Industry Association jointly discussed and decided to telegraph Chairman Shang Zhen of the Hebei Provincial Government, ordering the Hebei Provincial Bank to provide temporary assistance by issuing old copper coin notes to facilitate market circulation. Shang replied by telegram on the 3rd, approving the request, but with two conditions: (1) It is a temporary arrangement, and the copper coin notes will be withdrawn after the bank designated by the Finance Department issues copper coin notes. (2) Before issuing the old copper coins notes stored by the Hebei Provincial Bank, a legal price (i.e., exchange rate) should be set to avoid confusion and losses for the people when exchanging them. At 10:00 AM on the 4th, City Police Chief Liu Yushu, City Chamber of Commerce Chairman Ji Hua, Banking Association Chairman Zhong E, Money Industry Association Chairman Wang Xiaoyan, Hebei Provincial Bank Deputy Manager Wang Zocai, Tzu Lian Hui President Zhao Pinqing, and representatives of the exchange industry held a joint meeting to decide on five measures: (1) The use of Hebei Provincial copper coin notes will begin on December 5th. (2) The price of copper coins is temporarily set at 460 coins to exchange for one yuan of legal tender. (3) Regardless of whether it is copper coin notes or copper coins, holding 460 coins can be exchanged for one yuan of legal tender at the Hebei Provincial Bank. (4) All merchants dealing in copper coins must calculate the price of goods sold in either copper coin notes or copper coins according to the rate of 460 coins to one yuan of legal tender and must not arbitrarily increase prices. (5) The tram company will accept all copper coin notes, but passengers holding copper coins must still purchase tickets with copper coins. After the meeting, the Public Security Bureau telegraphed the City Government with the meeting's details and issued a notice to the public on the 5th. Regarding the amount of issuance, according to Hebei Provincial Bank Deputy Manager Wang Zocai, the bank, upon receiving Chairman Shang's telegram order and local requests, is issuing the existing copper coin notes as a temporary emergency measure. The amount issued this time is approximately 200,000 yuan, with denominations of ten coins, twenty coins, forty coins, sixty coins, and one hundred coins, partly unused notes that have already been printed and partly intact notes that have been issued and recovered. Because the market urgently needs them, it was originally planned to issue them on the afternoon of the 4th, but the procedures could not be completed in time, so it was changed to the morning of the 5th. Copper coins are also very scarce in Baoding, and they plan to issue copper coin notes recently. These copper coin notes can be circulated in the cities of Beiping and Tianjin and within the territory of Hebei Province, etc. The City Nine Districts Construction Office believes that although the copper coin panic has passed, the prices of various commodities have indeed increased significantly. On the 4th, they gathered at the First District Construction Office to discuss and earnestly request the authorities to quickly stabilize prices to maintain the people's livelihood. (5th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Two Guns Recovered in Robbery Case</h3>
<p>In the case of the robbery of the Lianyun automobile on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway in Yangjia Temple, Punan Eighth District, the Provincial Department severely ordered the county government to arrest the perpetrators, with severe punishment for any violations. After the 12th Detachment Headquarters and the Water Patrol Team jointly captured the bandits Zhang Xiaobao, Gen Gou, and Little Monk, they were sent to Songjiang for interrogation and then transferred to the local court for questioning. On the 6th, Water Patrol Team Captain Fei Gongxia, based on confidential reports that the bandit leader Li had secretly returned to Shuike, led Patrol Officer Yu and Lieutenant Adjutant Wang Wenxiong of the 12th Detachment Headquarters to patrol Shuike. They vaguely saw figures and shouted for the password, but there was no response. They fired three shots as a warning, and the figures scattered and fled. They tracked them in the dim night, but there was no trace. Searching along the path, they found two Jiu Yu rifles and one empty cartridge case hidden in the rice straw in the cemetery. One of the rifles was missing its firing pin. They continued to search until dawn and returned to the team headquarters, then transferred the guns to the county government. The gun numbers are 1409 and 324. It is said that these guns were the weapons robbed from the Xiahengjing Watch Post in Majing Township, Seventh District. They were used to rob and loot Zhujiaxing.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Detention of Merchants and Citizens Causes Panic in Various Industries</h3>
<p>Zhu Dongmei butcher shop on Pingjiang Road in Suzhou City sent its employee Zhang Heshang to Changzhou to purchase goods a few days ago. While passing Pingdoukou, the police found 300 double-dime silver coins on Zhang Heshang, suspected of smuggling, and took him to the Public Security Bureau for detention. Later, with the approval of the county government by the County Chamber of Commerce, Zhang was temporarily released on bail on the afternoon of the 6th. The county government submitted the large number of silver dimes to the province for instructions. However, the 30-odd trade associations in Wu County, including fresh meat, rice, oil, wine, sauce, southern goods, silk, wood, and woolen goods, were alarmed by the incident, fearing that the small change used in trade was inevitable. Moreover, the market continues to operate as usual, but income cannot be exported, and all industries will come to a complete standstill. During the winter season, the need for silver dimes to pay grain taxes and settle accounts is urgent. Banks are not ubiquitous in villages and towns, and the villagers are at a loss. If silver dimes cannot be taken from one county to another, and the Beijing-Shanghai trains pass more than a dozen times a day, and they are bound to be tired of searching, how can travelers be spared harassment? It is found that silver dimes are commonly known as subsidiary currency, and the Finance Department's telegram explained that silver refers to real silver and miscellaneous silver, which proves that silver dimes are not included in the restrictions, nor is there a prescribed quantity or restriction on use within the territory. This time, since the employee has proven to be a legitimate merchant, the Public Security Bureau has inevitably implicated innocent people and seems to have abused its power. On the afternoon of the 7th, they jointly telegraphed the County Chamber of Commerce to submit it to the Ministry of Finance and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, requesting that they issue a clear order to correct the situation and reassure businesses.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Police Mobilize to Inspect Tent Households</h3>
<p>The Wuxi County Public Security Bureau, in view of the current winter defense period and the fact that petty thieves are taking the opportunity to commit thefts and robberies are occurring frequently in urban and rural areas, and that tent households and awning boats easily harbor bandits, has formulated a tent household inspection plan and secretly ordered each sub-bureau and directly subordinate sub-stations in the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth districts to conduct a full mobilization on the 6th and 7th to carry out inspections. A total of more than 450 officials, officers, and police officers participated, departing simultaneously at 5:00 AM, while paying attention to household registration and doorplates at all times. The results of the inspection showed that the total number of tent households was: 928 in the first sub-bureau, 554 in the second sub-bureau, 1,302 in the third sub-bureau, 2,045 in the fourth sub-bureau, 791 in the fifth sub-bureau, 1,559 in the sixth sub-bureau, and 1,112 in the first sub-station, totaling 8,291. At the same time, the county water patrol team also conducted a thorough inspection of the awning boats in the territory and monitored the movement of those passing through at all times. During the inspection, the Hongqiao Wang Zhaofu thatched tent in the first sub-bureau and the Gu Futai thatched tent in Changjie Mushatou in the third sub-bureau were found to contain opium paste and smoking paraphernalia. Also, in the Xu Yulin tent household in Xishuiguan in the first sub-bureau, 83 silver dollars, 18 paper dollars, 12.3 dimes, 19,000 copper coins, a silver necklace weighing 3 liang and 6.2 qian, two silver bracelets weighing 3 liang, and a silver chain weighing 1 liang were found. As there was so much cash in the thatched tent, the circumstances were suspicious, and they were all taken to the bureau for transfer to the county for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Representatives of the Daily Newspaper Association Petition</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the dispute over the arrest of a reporter from the Zhonghua Daily by the Security Police Team of the County Public Security Bureau, the Daily Newspaper Association convened a meeting on the 6th and selected 16 representatives who went to the County Party Headquarters and the County Government at 10:00 AM on the 6th with petitions. County Executive Committee Member Yu and County Magistrate Ma of the County Government received them in person, adopted the representatives' statements, accepted the petitions, and expressed satisfaction. The representatives then took their leave and departed.</p>
<h3>Correspondence</h3>
<p>The Beining Railway Bureau writes to inform us that your newspaper reported on the 2nd of this month that the director of the Lu River Railway Bridge repair material factory received an order from the head office to temporarily suspend construction, important materials were transported to Tangshan's Xinhe for temporary storage, and all work on the Ao Bridge was completely stopped from the 29th. Furthermore, the construction company's office was also closed, and all employees had left. This is not in accordance with the facts and is presumably based on inaccurate rumors. We are writing to you to request that you investigate and promptly issue a correction. Sincerely, Beining Railway Administration, December 5th.</p>

<h3>Our Country's Scientific Research Undertakings (Continued)</h3>
<p>(Speech to secondary school students nationwide on November 26th)</p>
<p>Ding Wenjiang, Director-General of the Academia Sinica (Speech to secondary school students nationwide on November 26th)</p>
<p>Today, I want to talk about the liaison and cooperation in scientific undertakings in our country. But first, I want to explain the history and mission of the Academia Sinica.</p>
<p>The Academia Sinica was established in April of the 17th year of the Republic [1928]. According to its organizational law, it is the highest academic research institution of the Republic of China, directly under the National Government. Its mission is twofold: first, to carry out scientific research, and second, to guide, liaise with, and encourage academic research. To carry out the first type of mission, the Academia Sinica has established a total of ten research institutes. The three institutes of physics, chemistry, and engineering are located in Shanghai because they need to liaise with industrial institutions at home and abroad. In addition, the general organs of astronomy, meteorology, geology, botany and zoology, psychology, history and language, social sciences, and management administration are all concentrated in Nanjing. From this, it can be seen that the scope of research of the Academia Sinica is extremely broad, encompassing most of the natural sciences on the one hand, and social sciences and history and language on the other. To understand the content of its research, we can analyze its tasks into three types.</p>
<p>The first is a number of routine tasks, such as the astronomical observatory's calculation of almanacs, observation of variable stars, and counting sunspots daily; the meteorological observatory's observation of temperature, air pressure, and wind direction, and reporting of weather, which clearly belong to this category. Not only that, but ordinary chemical analysis, standard engineering tests, physical geomagnetic measurements, geological mapping, and collection of botanical and zoological specimens can all be considered a kind of routine task. Strictly speaking, this cannot be considered research, but it is the basis of many research works, and often takes a long time to achieve results. For example, engineers need to build bridges and prevent floods, and agricultural and forestry experts need to improve production and promote forests, all of which require knowing the average rainfall in these areas for many years. In any country, this kind of work is undertaken by the government, and the institutions that undertake this task are often independent. In China, however, it is accidentally accommodated under a single general organ—the Academia Sinica. This, of course, can have obvious advantages, because under one organ, it is relatively easy for those who do this work to communicate with each other, help each other, and unify and cooperate all work, so as to accomplish the most tasks with the least amount of funding.</p>
<p>The most important and practical task of the Academia Sinica is to use scientific methods to study our country's raw materials and production. In our industrially backward country, it is very difficult to have new and different inventions of our own. However, we have our own special natural products and traditional skills. If we can understand the quality of our raw materials and the principles of production, it will be easy to use new methods to improve old industries or develop new resources. For example, in terms of minerals, using geological methods to discover new mines, I mentioned the achievements of the Geological Survey of the Ministry of Industry in my last speech. Now I want to give an example of the achievements of the Geological Institute of the Academia Sinica.</p>
<p>Fushanpu in Pingyang, Zhejiang, has always been a place where alum is produced. Five years ago, Mr. Ye Liangfu, a researcher at the Academia Sinica, went to investigate and found out that this is the largest alunite mine in the world. Its reserves are nearly 300 million tons. Alunite is originally a kind of potassium aluminum sulfate. We now use indigenous methods to make it into alum, which is of little value and has a very narrow market. The annual output is worth only more than 600,000 yuan. If we can process the original alunite into alumina on the one hand, as a raw material for aluminum smelting; and on the other hand, process it into potassium sulfate, or use a part of the sulfuric acid to manufacture ammonium sulfate; the result will be that alum, which has very limited uses, will be transformed into several kinds of essential products with extremely large markets. The annual production capacity can definitely be increased several times. Currently, the Institute of Chemistry of the Academia Sinica and the Chemical Industry Society in Tanggu are both working on this issue. Because there are still technical difficulties, it has not yet reached the stage of real success. But knowing that the reserves of Fushanpu's alunite mine are so large is the starting point of this research. Because alunite mines are of course also available in foreign countries, but the reserves are relatively small, so they are not worth paying attention to, and it is not worth studying new methods to use them to manufacture aluminum or fertilizers. Since we know that this kind of alunite mine is a very large resource for us, of course we are not willing to let it go easily, and only use it as a raw material for manufacturing alum.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that porcelain was invented by our ancestors. In recent years, our porcelain industry has slowly declined and cannot compete with Japanese porcelain. The most important reasons are nothing more than two: first, the workers who manufacture porcelain only know how to follow the methods passed down from previous generations to make blanks, glazes, and fire kilns. Regarding all functions, they only know the what but not the why. For example, why is it that the same clay with the same appearance can be used to make white porcelain in Jingdezhen, but can only be used to make purple clay in Yixing? If you ask a porcelain-firing worker, he cannot tell you the reason. Therefore, not only can it not be improved, but also because of changes in the quality of raw materials, the products deteriorate. Second, because foreign porcelain is made by machines, the quality has certain standards. We are completely handmade, and the quality cannot be consistent. If you go to a porcelain shop to see the bowls produced in Jiangxi, the size and shape of the products from the same kiln are not the same, you will know the advantages and disadvantages of the new and old industries, and the path we should strive for. The Academia Sinica has established a ceramic testing ground in the Institute of Engineering. First, it cooperates with the Geological Institute to thoroughly study the geological genesis and reserves of clay and glaze materials from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Hunan, and use standard methods to collect mineral samples for analysis and testing, so that various raw materials can be standardized. (Standardization) Then select the raw materials with the richest reserves and the most suitable mineral quality, and use small-scale machinery to test and manufacture pottery. This work has not started for long, but I believe that there will be considerable results in the short term, which can serve as the basis for the revival of our pottery industry.</p>
<p>There are also many methods commonly used in agriculture and industry that may be possible in foreign countries but not in China. If you want to imitate others, you must understand the Chinese environment and re-study it yourself. For example, cotton has several important diseases and pests, such as anthracnose, angular leaf spot, seedling blight, and damping-off. These are all because bacteria harm cotton seeds. Some of these bacteria live on the shell of the cotton seeds, and some are hidden in the soil. In foreign countries, when sowing, the cotton seeds are disinfected with medicine on the one hand, and poison is sprinkled in the soil on the other hand. In China, these methods cannot be adopted. First, because medicines have to be purchased from foreign countries, the price is too expensive, and second, because our farmers are too poor to afford this disinfection capital. And these diseases and pests are extremely prevalent in our country. Cotton that has suffered from these diseases either turns black and spotted or withers, causing great losses every year. Recently, Mr. Deng Shuqun of the Institute of Botany and Zoology of the Academia Sinica has studied this problem and found a solution. According to his experiments, if the cotton seeds are soaked in boiling water before sowing, the toxic bacteria attached to the cotton seed shell can be killed. The cotton seed shell is very thick, and soaking it in boiling water is not only harmless but can also make it germinate earlier. Then apply mercuric chloride and grass ash to the cotton seeds and then sow them, and the above-mentioned diseases can be completely eliminated. Mercuric chloride is a kind of poison that can kill bacteria in the soil. Because it is not sprinkled in the soil but mixed with grass ash, the bactericidal effect is the same and the amount required is less. Moreover, it is the habit of our country's farmers to mix seeds with grass ash before sowing, so this method does not require much labor. Boiling water does not cost much money. According to Mr. Deng's calculation, using his method, each mu of land only needs to use one tael of mercuric chloride to be effective. One tael of mercuric chloride costs only a little more than one jiao at market price, which is much more economical than the old method used in foreign countries. If our farmers can use this method to grow cotton, each mu only needs to spend a very small amount of money to completely prevent four diseases and pests, and the reduced losses will be at least ten times more than the money spent on disinfection.</p>
<p>Ephedra was originally an old Chinese medicine, but the method of use was extremely unscientific. Since Mr. Chen Kehui's research at Peking Union Medical College proved that the ephedrine contained in ephedra is a specific medicine for treating asthma, the true effect of ephedra has become clear. Therefore, the Beiping Research Institute has specially set up a Drug Research Institute, inviting Mr. Zhao Shimin to study Chinese medicinal materials, and the Institute of Chemistry of the Academia Sinica also has people cooperating with Mr. Zhao to do this work. But more important than drugs is our food problem. Everyone knows that the efficiency of Chinese laborers is extremely low, less than half of that of Europeans and Americans. For example, Chinese miners work twelve hours a day and can only mine an average of half a ton of coal. British miners, under almost the same circumstances, work eight hours and can mine 1.2 tons of coal. However, during the European War, these Chinese miners were transported to France by the British to dig trenches. Eating bread and beef, the work efficiency was no less than that of Western Europeans. The same is true for working-class workers and petty-bourgeois students. Anyone who has examined the bodies of Chinese students knows that the physical development of Chinese students is generally not healthy. The reason is because the food they eat is not nutritious enough. We cannot hope that everyone can eat meat, but we hope that those who study chemistry will study our usual foods, determine their nutritional value, so that we can use a scientific basis to redistribute our food. According to the research of Professor [missing character] Ben of Tsinghua University, the vitality contained in Beiping's [missing character] is the same as that of American oranges. Although this is the case, not only should poor people eat more [missing character], but rich people can also buy less American oranges. The Institute of Chemistry of the Academia Sinica is working on this kind of problem. If we can improve our food within the scope of our country's national economic capacity, the working efficiency of the general public will definitely increase a lot.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Federation Cables to Request an Explicit Order to Punish the Rebels</h3>
<p>The First Special District Citizens' Federation of Shanghai submitted a petition to the Central Executive Committee and the National Government yesterday, stating: "To the Nanjing Central Executive Committee, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Military Affairs Commission: The situation in North China, after the Minister of Military and Political Affairs, He Yingqin, went north to take charge, has worsened. Japanese planes have been flying over Peiping in a show of force for days, forming formations in the sky, creating a situation similar to the Rehe Incident of the year before last. The news has spread, and the public is outraged. We believe that Peiping and Tianjin are our country's territory, but due to the oppression of foreign powers, a group of frustrated politicians and shameless hooligans have colluded to betray the central government, forge organizations, falsely claim autonomy, and cede land to others. This is truly a national disaster, and it is urgent. All who have blood and spirit hate it with gnashing teeth. The federation, as a citizen group in the special district of Shanghai, in the midst of extreme hardship and suffering, will definitely not hesitate to make any sacrifices and will sincerely support the central government and jointly condemn it in order to achieve the unity of the central government's authority and the integrity of the national territory. We respectfully cable this petition, and we respectfully request that you quickly decide on a major plan and issue an explicit order to punish the rebels, so that the country can turn from danger to safety and the nation can have a day of freedom. We urgently cable this petition, and we humbly ask for your consideration. First Special District Citizens' Federation of Shanghai."</p>

<h3>Brief Biography of Mr. Gosh, the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai; However, There Is No Definite Date for His Arrival in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that the U.S. Department of State has recently appointed Gosh, a first-class diplomatic affairs officer, as the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai. The exact date of his arrival in Shanghai is currently unknown, and he will probably not arrive in Shanghai to take office until a few months later. Gosh was born in Washington in 1887. He joined the Department of State in 1903. He came to Shanghai in 1907 as acting Consul General, and returned to Washington in 1909. In 1912, he was reappointed as acting Consul General in Shanghai. In 1915, he was appointed as Deputy Consul in Shanghai. Later, he served as Consul General in Tianjin, Xiamen, Jinan, and Fengtian. In 1924, he resumed his position in Tianjin. After two years, Kenningham asked for leave to return to the United States, so he came to Shanghai to temporarily take over the position of Consul General, and then returned to Tianjin. In 1931, he was transferred back to the Department of State in Washington. In 1933, he was appointed as Consul General in Paris and Counselor of the U.S. Embassy. He is still stationed in Paris.

<h3>Ministry of Finance's Reply to the Chamber of Commerce: Remembering Measures to Stabilize Sichuan Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to stabilize the Sichuan exchange rate, the Chamber received Reply No. 8018 from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, which stated: "Your telegram is acknowledged. Since this Ministry reorganized Sichuan's local currency and established the Central Bank's notes as the standard, the Sichuan exchange rate had already stabilized. Recently, Chongqing's silver and money businesses, due to insufficient funds in circulation, issued 'exchange warrants' for inter-bank transfers. This has caused the Shanghai exchange rate to fluctuate again, contrary to this Ministry's intention to maintain Sichuan's financial stability. We have telegraphed Chairman Chiang and Chairman Liu to strictly order all banks and firms in Chongqing to recall the 'exchange warrants' immediately and prohibit their re-issuance. Simultaneously, we have instructed Chongqing's silver and money businesses to contact the Central Bank and the Bank of China for loans to facilitate the recall. These 'exchange warrants' will be recalled soon, and the Sichuan exchange rate will return to normal. Please inform the Chamber accordingly." This reply.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine: Petitioning for the Promulgation of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Regulations</h3>
<p>The Traditional Chinese Medicine Regulations were passed by the Legislative Yuan at its 43rd meeting on December 15th, 1933, but have not been promulgated. National medical organizations have successively submitted petitions urging their promulgation, but without result. Now, it is learned that the Shanghai Municipal Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine has also sent separate telegrams to the Fifth National Congress and the First Plenary Session. Excerpts are as follows: (1) Petition to the Fifth National Congress: Regarding the Traditional Chinese Medicine Regulations, which have already been passed by the Legislative Yuan, we respectfully request that the case be reviewed and submitted to the National Government for prompt promulgation, so that they may be followed and medical affairs may be emphasized. We believe that traditional Chinese medicine has a history of thousands of years, with remarkable efficacy. Its healing methods have been revered throughout history and remain unchanged. Since the rise of Western medicine in China, a trend has emerged, and many believe in it, resulting in a decline in traditional Chinese medicine, which is lamentable. Those who deeply understand the excellence of traditional Chinese medicine know that it cannot be abandoned, and they deeply believe that it is valued by foreigners. Therefore, some people publicly drafted the Traditional Chinese Medicine Regulations, which were submitted to the Legislative Yuan and passed last year. However, they have not yet been promulgated and implemented. Now, we respectfully express the views of the members of this association, petitioning the Congress to review the case and submit it to the National Government for prompt promulgation, so that it may be followed and medical affairs may be emphasized. At the same time, it should be incorporated into the education system, so that traditional Chinese medicine becomes a specialized subject for national study. This will allow for gradual progress and further reforms, ensure that traditional Chinese medicine is not neglected, and benefit both the national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, we present this document for your review. We respectfully request that the National Government approve its implementation. We are deeply grateful. Sincerely presented. (2) Petition to the First Plenary Session: (Opening omitted) The Traditional Chinese Medicine Regulations were passed by the Legislative Yuan years ago, but the Executive Yuan has not yet promulgated them, causing public anxiety and uncertainty. At this Fifth National Congress, a resolution was passed to treat both traditional Chinese and Western medicine equally in order to promote scholarship and benefit the people's livelihood, and it was submitted to your Congress for consideration. Regarding the question of whether the Traditional Chinese Medicine Regulations should be revised, we respectfully request that you promptly pass it, and immediately send the Traditional Chinese Medicine Regulations to the Executive Yuan of the National Government for prompt promulgation, in order to satisfy public expectations and benefit the people's livelihood. This is a public convenience that we anxiously await.</p>

<h3>Public Notice from the Municipal Public Safety Bureau: Smokers to Exchange for Opium Cessation Licenses</h3>
<p>Complete the exchange within three months...Licenses not collected by the deadline will be cancelled. The Public Safety Bureau issued a public notice stating: "Smokers, previously, the number of you registered at this Bureau and its various branches was very large, and there was not enough time to fill out the licenses. The licenses are being successively filled out and distributed to the branches for verification and exchange. Now, this Bureau has completed filling out the opium cessation licenses for both the 'ordinary' and 'poor' categories of smokers who registered in the seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh months (of the year), and has issued them to the branches for distribution. It is feared that many of you have moved, making it impossible for the branches to deliver the licenses to the addresses. Therefore, this public notice is issued to inform all smokers who registered before November and hold receipts to bring their receipts to the original registration bureau within this month to exchange them for official licenses. If you fail to collect your licenses by the deadline, they will be cancelled. Do not delay and jeopardize your interests. This notice is issued by Bureau Chief Cai Jingjun."</p>

<h3>Zhou Wenzhi's Birthday Feast Funds Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>National currency: 1,000 yuan</p>
<p>Mu Ouchu, Deputy Director of the fundraising group of the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Flood Relief in Various Provinces, received a check for 1,000 yuan in national currency and a letter from Zhou Wenzhi yesterday for disaster relief. The letter stated: "Brother Ouchu, Greetings. This year, I am celebrating my sixtieth birthday. My son Zengkui and daughter Zenggui wanted to hold a celebration for me. However, given the current difficult times and frequent disasters, I am unwilling to celebrate. My children insisted, requesting that I consider it better to use the money for a meaningful cause of relief rather than meaningless waste. Therefore, I have gathered 1,000 yuan from the funds they intended to use for the celebration and donated it for flood relief, to do my part in helping those in need and to satisfy my children's wishes. I am sending this amount to you to forward to the Flood Relief Association to receive the funds. I especially inform you and wish you well. Sincerely, your brother Zhou Wenzhi."

<h3>Live Plucking of Pig Bristles Causes Huge Losses: Fresh Pig Industry Refuses to Accept Injured Piglets</h3>
<p>Requesting Authorities to Vigorously Prohibit...Notice to Customers to Pay Attention</p>
<p>The Fresh Pig Slaughter Industry Association of this city has stated that, as winter approaches, customers from various regions are shipping pigs that have had their bristles live-plucked by workers. This is very unfavorable to the pigs' survival. Often, the piglets die within a day or two after being injured, resulting in significant business losses. The Sanitation Bureau's inspection also identifies them as diseased pigs, causing substantial financial losses. Therefore, an emergency meeting was convened the other day. As a result of the discussion, it was decided that, starting from the 10th of this month, all pigs that have had their bristles live-plucked will be rejected. A notice was issued yesterday stating: "Notice: Since the beginning of winter, the piglets slaughtered by this industry on behalf of various pig shops in the Nanshi area have had almost all of their bristles live-plucked. Not only is this industry's due profit completely deprived, but also the injured piglets often die soon after slaughter. The meat is red, and the Sanitation Bureau inspectors often identify them as diseased pigs, resulting in losses and grievances. Such extra losses are considerable and unbearable in the long run. Therefore, in order to save the industry from suffering, it was decided at the emergency meeting of this association that, starting from the 10th of this month, this industry will not accept any piglets that have had their bristles live-plucked, in order to avoid losses and reduce suffering. A separate letter has been sent to the Fresh Pig Industry and Fresh Meat Industry Associations for their information. This notice is hereby published in the newspaper. To the Fresh Meat Industry Association: The suffering of the piglets sold by various pig shops in the Nanshi area and slaughtered by our industry due to the live plucking of bristles has already been mentioned above. It is unnecessary to repeat it. It is hereby decided that, starting from the 10th of this month, piglets that have had their bristles live-plucked will not be accepted. If your industry is short of goods for the market, please purchase from Wusong and Yangjing. We are mutually concerned about each other's pain and share the same interests. We hope for your understanding and assistance. A separate letter has been sent to your association for notification. Sincerely, December 7th, 1935."</p>

<h3>Case of Selling Handguns Involves Japanese Offender</h3>
<p>Huo Zhongbo and Haruyama Bunji were apprehended together by detectives.</p>
<p>Huo Zhongbo, a Cantonese resident of No. 31 Zhixiang Lane, Dongbaoxing Road, Zhabei, has recently been jointly engaged in the business of selling handguns with a Japanese man named Haruyama Bunji. Detectives Zhang Desheng and Liu Longchao of the Jiaxing Road Police Station learned of this, disguised themselves as buyers, contacted Huo, and arranged to meet at Room 11 of the Hongkou Hotel on North Sichuan Road the day before to deliver the guns and ammunition. The detectives waited in the room, and Huo and Haruyama Bunji arrived together. The detectives arrested both of them and seized four handguns and one hundred ten bullets, which were taken back to the police station. Haruyama was handed over to the Japanese Consulate, while Huo was brought to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court yesterday.

<h3>Russian Owner Kills Russian Partner: Sentenced to Twelve Years of Imprisonment</h3>
<p>The owner of the candy and bread store at No. 234-6 Avenue Albert, Russian citizen Bliqiang (transliteration), 48 years old, killed his business partner, Russian citizen Semyanov (transliteration, 30 years old), because Semyanov engaged in indecent behavior with his nine-year-old daughter Lala (transliteration) and seven-year-old daughter Weiliang (transliteration). On the afternoon of the 26th of last month, at 2:00 PM, he called Semyanov upstairs to question him. Because Semyanov not only refused to admit it but also became violent, Bliqiang became overwhelmed with anger and stabbed Semyanov to death with a sharp meat knife, inflicting a total of ten wounds to his throat, abdomen, and arms. Afterward, Bliqiang surrendered himself to the French Police Station. The police transported Semyanov's body to the morgue and reported it to the Second Special District Court, which sent officials to verify the cause of death. Because there were no family members, the body was buried by the Municipal Council's charity organization. Bliqiang was handed over to the Second Special District Court, and the French Police Department filed a public prosecution against him for murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law. Judge Zhang Chaozu conducted the trial and scheduled the sentencing. All details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, at 10:00 AM, Judge Zhang arrived at the First Criminal Division and ordered the defendant to be brought before the court. Bliqiang was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment for murder. After the sentencing, the defendant was ordered to be detained in the detention center during the appeal period. After the appeal period, he will be sent to prison to serve his sentence. It is also heard that the defendant is dissatisfied with the verdict and will file an appeal after receiving the judgment.</p>
<h3>Chen Changgeng's Invention: Chen-Style Chinese Typewriter: Can Type Horizontally and Vertically</h3>
<p>The Datong News Agency reports that Chen Changgeng, a Ningbo native residing at Houde Lane, Pissot Road, has invented a Chinese typewriter that can type horizontally and vertically, recognizing that the inability of Chinese typewriters to do both was a deficiency. He has submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry for a patent. Yesterday, this reporter visited Mr. Chen, who was wearing a blue cotton shirt and pants and appeared very simple and honest. According to him, he previously worked at the Yu Binji Typewriter Factory. He realized that Chinese typewriters that could type horizontally could not type vertically, and those that could type vertically could not type horizontally. This was very inconvenient in application. Therefore, he devoted himself to research and finally succeeded after more than five years. However, he intends to continue his research in order to achieve greater precision. He then showed us his completed Chinese typewriter. The machine is horizontal, 18 inches long, 22 inches wide, and 9.5 inches high, weighing approximately 65 pounds. Its special features include: (A) All materials are entirely domestic products; (B) It can type horizontally and vertically; (C) It only requires No. 4 font, which can be used in any printing house; (D) There is no risk of the type bars getting stuck. Therefore, its effectiveness surpasses that of any other Chinese typewriter. The machine is now named the Chen-Style Chinese Typewriter, and he has submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry for a patent. He has received Reply No. 13947 from the Ministry of Industry, which states: "Applicant Chen Changgeng has submitted a letter requesting a patent for the typewriter design and specifications submitted in accordance with the order. The letter and attachments have been received. Please report to the Industrial Technology Encouragement Review Committee for review and then submit for approval. There are no restrictions in the regulations on whether items can be manufactured and sold during the patent application period. Please be informed."</p>
<h3>Not Hesitating to Labor, Appealing for the Disaster Victims; The Boy Scouts' Universal Donation Results Announced; The Total Amount Reached Over 35,804 Yuan; The Highest Record in the History of Boy Scouts' General Mobilization for Fundraising</h3>
<p>First Place in Total Amount by Group: Minli Girls' High School; First Place in Average Amount by Group: Dazhong Middle School; First Place Individually: Qian Yueying from Minli Girls' High School</p>
<p>The Shanghai Relief Association for Flood Victims in Various Provinces, considering the widespread devastation and immense suffering in various regions, and the approaching severe winter making the situation even more critical, deemed it necessary to provide relief to avert the rural crisis and help the disaster victims survive. It consulted and obtained the consent of the Shanghai Boy Scouts Council to launch a city-wide general mobilization of Boy Scouts to raise funds for relief. Li Dachao, Deputy Director of the Fundraising Group of the Flood Relief Association, and Luo Lie, a member of the Boy Scouts Council, were responsible for carrying out the project. A total of 112 groups with 6,700 participants were involved. The general mobilization began on the 9th of last month, lasting for two days externally and one week internally, concluding on the 17th. Details of the efforts were reported in this newspaper. During the fundraising period, rumors were rampant in the city, and some Boy Scouts had to leave school, making it difficult for each group to collect donation tickets and funds. Despite the Boy Scouts Council's strict orders for each group to submit their collections, it was not until the 3rd of this month that all the donations were collected. Due to the large amount, especially the abundance of small coins and fractional notes, the funds were checked and calculated over several days, and the statistics were finally completed yesterday. A total of supplementary coins and fractional notes were collected, amounting to 27,569.55 silver dollars, 96,684.5 small silver dollars, and 56,411 copper coins. According to the legal regulations, 12 small silver dollars are converted into one yuan, and 300 copper coins are converted into one yuan, totaling 35,814.629 national currency silver dollars. This amount has exceeded the previous Boy Scout fundraising record by more than twofold. In the current depressed economic climate, it is not easy to raise such a sum to help the disaster victims. The enthusiasm and generosity of people from all walks of life are truly moving. Mayor Wu of Shanghai, recognizing the Boy Scouts' consistent and commendable service to the disaster victims in the past, specially made 40 silk banners to commend their benevolent spirit and encourage them. All groups ranked in the top ten in terms of total amount, the top ten in terms of average amount per person, and the top twenty individuals in terms of individual amount received a silk banner each. Boy Scout Council members Leng Xueqiao and Luo Lie also presented the "Three Trainings of the Chinese Boy Scouts" (deluxe bound edition), which they had personally compiled. All members ranked in the top twenty in terms of total amount or with an average donation of over seven yuan per person received a deluxe copy of the book. Individuals with donations of over one hundred yuan each received a copy of the book. In addition, the Flood Relief Association and the Council presented each group with certificates and Boy Scout commemorative badges according to regulations to encourage their spirit of service to the community.

<h3>Proving Two Foreign Constables Pushed a Sick Person into the River to Their Death; Two Western Constables Are Accused; Sun Jinsheng's Detailed Account of Rescuing Ma Debiao; The Police File a Fair Lawsuit with the British Court</h3>
<p>At 2:45 AM on the 1st of this month, Chinese Constable No. 1728 from the Jiaxing Road Police Station was patrolling the intersection of Xinjihang Road and Zhoujiazui Road when he suddenly saw a man lying on the side of the road, unable to speak and seemingly seriously ill. He immediately reported the information to the police station by telephone. The station then dispatched Western Constables E.W. Peters No. 229 and W.A. Jndd No. 106, along with Chinese Constable No. 3067 as the driver, to the location in a car. They carried the man onto the car and drove to the intersection of Feilun Road and Yalu Road. Suddenly, the two Western constables ordered the driver to stop the car and then threw the man into the river before driving back to the police station. A passerby, Sun Jinsheng, and others witnessed this and immediately devised a way to rescue him. They reported the incident to Chinese Constable No. 993 of the Hongkou Police Station, who sent him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Unfortunately, the treatment was ineffective, and he died at 8:00 AM the day before yesterday. The body was transported to the Feilun Road morgue for examination. After investigating the incident, the Hongkou Police Station found that the two Western constables had violated the law and, on the morning of the 5th, sent them to the British Consulate for legal prosecution. The hearing was postponed to next Tuesday, and they were each released on bail of 200 pounds. The day before yesterday afternoon, the First Special District Court appointed forensic doctors Wei Ligong and Zhang Yan to conduct an autopsy at the morgue together with doctors from the Municipal Council. Yesterday morning around 10:00 AM, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special Court's Prosecutor's Office, along with the two forensic doctors and court clerk Wang Zuyi, came to inspect the body again. They then began the public hearing. First, Western Police Chief Bonner reported the incident. Sun Jinsheng testified that he was 26 years old, a local resident living at No. 493 Feilun Road, and made a living selling vegetables. He said that he went out at 3:00 AM that morning and saw a car parked beside the riverbank. Two Western constables were leaning over the railing, looking into the river. One of them was also shining a flashlight. He noticed that the car was No. 8502. After the two constables got into the car and left, he ran to the riverbank and saw the deceased. He borrowed a bamboo pole from a boat docked on the shore and used it to rescue him. He also shouted for help. Guo Sanyuanzi testified that he was 31 years old, from Gaoyou, lived at No. 491 Feilun Road, and ran a small shop. He said that he was asleep at 3:00 AM that morning when he heard shouts for help. He got up and ran over, and saw Sun Jinsheng had already rescued the deceased. He helped pull him up and saw that the deceased was foaming at the mouth. Chinese Constable No. 3067 testified that he was driving the car at 2:45 AM that morning and saw the two Western constables throw the deceased into the river. Chinese Detective Shi Guichun from the Hongkou Police Station testified that he had investigated at Tongren Hospital and learned from the deceased that he was Ma Debiao, 48 years old, from Nanjing. He had come to Shanghai from his hometown to find a friend but was unsuccessful. Because he had no food to eat, he jumped into the river that day. He seemed confused when he spoke, and his words were slurred. After hearing the testimonies, Prosecutor Guo ruled that the deceased, Ma Debiao, was a male who died from pneumonia before being thrown into the water. According to the police investigation and witness testimonies, the deceased was pushed into the river by the British men Peter and Judd. Since the police have already filed a lawsuit against the two British men with the British Consulate, the case should be handled by the British court. The body was handed over to the Pushan Villa for burial.</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that Mao Debiao, who was injured after being thrown into the Hongkou River on the night of December 1st by two British police chiefs as reported in yesterday's newspaper, died at Tongren Hospital on Friday morning. Since this involves a death, the cause of death is currently being thoroughly investigated. British authorities have refused to comment on Mr. Ma's death, only stating that the case will continue to be heard next Tuesday as originally scheduled.</p>
<h3>The Social Affairs Bureau Orders Pawnshops to Temporarily Shorten the Redemption Period and Instructs Each Pawnshop to Submit a Detailed List</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau issued a written order to the Shanghai Pawnshop Association yesterday, stating: "Regarding the association's request to shorten the redemption period for pawned goods to twelve months, which has been submitted to the Bureau and approved, we have now received Order No. 16113 from the Municipal Government, stating that both requests have been received. The Municipal Pawnshop Association's earlier request to shorten the period has been forwarded to the government by the Bureau. Given the current economic depression and the decline of various industries, to prevent the closure of legitimate shops and indirectly affect the poor who rely on pawnshops, it is temporarily approved to shorten the full redemption period to twelve months. When the economic situation improves, the current regulations will be reinstated. This was resolved at the 290th Municipal Council meeting and approved, and it has been reported to the central government for record. Therefore, you are hereby ordered to inform all members of the association to comply with this order, determine the shortened period, and submit a detailed list of pawnshops that have shortened the period and those that have not, for record." This order is issued.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Fish Market under the Ministry of Industry has Appointed Supervisors and Directors; Du Yuesheng Resigns as Chairman of the Board of Supervisors</h3>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that the supervisors and directors of the Shanghai Fish Market under the Ministry of Industry have been appointed by the Ministry. There are two supervisors: Yu Qiaqing and Du Yuesheng. There are six directors: Zhang Shenzhi, Fang Jiaobo, Zhang Xiaogeng, Yu Kaihong (Advisor to the Ministry of Industry), Hou Zhaohai (Section Chief of the Ministry of Industry), and Yuan Lianghua (Director of the Fishery Protection Office). The appointment letters have been sent to Shanghai for distribution.</p>
<p>Shen Shi News reports that Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry, has specially established the Shanghai Fish Market Supervisory Board in Shanghai to develop the fishing industry and reorganize the fish market. He appointed Mr. Du Yuesheng and Mr. Yu Qiaqing as supervisors and invited Mr. Du Yuesheng to be the chairman of the board. However, due to Mr. Du's previous position as chairman of the Shanghai Fish Trade Association, there may be conflicts of interest between his official and commercial duties. Therefore, he submitted a resignation to the Ministry of Industry. Minister Chen sent a letter to retain him, but Mr. Du believes that it is practically impossible to handle both positions concurrently and will submit his resignation to the Ministry again tomorrow. It is said that Mr. Du is very determined to resign.</p>
<h3>The News Detective Squad Continuously Cracks Down on Theft Gangs and Interrogates Them</h3>
<p>Nine Men and Women and Suspects Were Arrested; Two Genuine and Fake Handguns and Five Bullets Were Seized. The Xinzha Detective Squad has recently solved many theft cases in the past one or two months, which have been repeatedly reported in the newspapers. It is now known that the deputy squad leaders Bao Ziying and Shi Zuhan recently received a report from Detective Zhongda that a theft gang was hiding in Tongfu Lane, Songjiazhai, north of Caojiadu, and possessing handguns and bullets. After receiving the report, squad leaders Bao and Shi immediately reported to Bureau Chief Liao and dispatched police officer Xia Tingkai, along with the original reporter Zhongda and other detectives Liu Bingrong, Zhang Shuwen, Zang Nai, Yang Yucai, Zhou Deming, and Sun Youzhi, to the Caojiadu branch to dispatch police officer Shi Xiaoteng to assist. They successively apprehended five male and female thieves and suspects Meng Wuban, Li Qinghua, Li Qingguo, Li Xiaosanzi, and Sun Zhao in Tongfu Lane, Songjiazhai, at numbers 71, 8, 4, and 222, and seized a genuine Browning handgun with serial number 6555, five bullets, and a fake handgun. It is said that there were other thieves residing in Wuzhen Road, Kulun Road, Dayang Bridge, and other areas under the jurisdiction of the Xinzha branch. Squad leaders Bao and Shi brought the five male and female thieves back and dispatched the entire detective team to arrest people in Wuzhen Road, Kulun Road, and Dayang Bridge. They arrested Li Shuyuan at the tile house by the river under Dayang Bridge, Hong Fakuan at No. 16 Rongfu Lane, Xu Liangtu at No. 245 Wuzhen Road, Kulun Road, and Xu Xia at No. 11. All were brought back to the station for interrogation. The confessions of the thieves and suspects are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Meng Wuban confessed: I am 28 years old and used to be a night soil carrier. Around the middle of July this year, I, along with Zhang Fuhua, Cai Mingcheng, Zhang Jingzhi, Li Qinghua, Li Shuyuan, and others, robbed the Gu family, who deals with yellow sand and gravel at the end of Zhongxing Road. The stolen goods were 45 silver dollars, three silver chains, a pair of filigree silver bracelets, a gold ring, a pair of flat silver bracelets, a Xiangyunsha short shirt, a gold-plated pocket watch, and two pairs of silk black trousers, which were found by Hong Dekuan and Xu Renji selling thread. Zhang Fuhua had the handgun. After the robbery, we divided the loot upstairs at the teahouse opened by Mao Laoer near Dayang Bridge. I got four silver dollars. In September, Zhang Fuhua, Zhang Jingzhi, Li Shuyuan, and I robbed the Jiang family at No. 4 Anjili, Haichang Road, and got 65 silver dollars. Because an old woman shouted for help, we had to escape quickly and left behind two umbrellas, which were also located by Xu and his accomplice. I got three silver dollars. Around June or July, Zhang Fuhua, Li Shuyuan, Hong Fakuan, Li Qinghua, and I robbed a Chongming man's family in the countryside of Caojiadu and got two silver dollars and a bag of three thousand copper coins, which was not divided but used for meals. In November, Wang Dacheng (also known as Lao Si), Yu Jinbiao, and I robbed a tiger stove in the British Concession behind the Zhonghua Printing House on Aomen Road and got a gold ring, two gold-plated hairpins, seven silver dollars, and 73 silver cents, which were located by Mao Laoer. Cai Mingcheng's handgun was taken by Wang Dacheng. I got three silver dollars. I also robbed the Tao Jinji Construction Factory on Bailinan Road, Yidingpan Road, and got 279 silver dollars. I went there with Yang San, Zhang Jingzhi, Yu Jinbiao, etc., which was located by Ding Er and Yu Jinbiao. I got 20 silver dollars. I haven't done anything else. (2) Li Qinghua confessed: I am 24 years old and used to work at the Zhentai Yarn Factory. In July of this year, I, along with Meng Wuban, Zhang Fuhua, and others, robbed the Gu family at the end of Zhongxing Road and got three silver dollars. In June or July, I picked up from the Chongming people in Caojiadu, but I didn't get any money because it was used for meals. The fake handgun that was seized was brought by Wang Dacheng and placed in my brother's house. (3) Li Shuyuan confessed: I am 27 years old. In October, Zhang Fuhua, Xu Liangtu, Zhang Jingzhi, and Cai Mingcheng robbed a person sitting in a rickshaw on Song Park Road and got 700 silver dollars. Zhang Fuhua had the handgun and pointed it at the victim. I held onto the rickshaw shaft. Cai Mingcheng took the silver dollars. Later, we divided the loot on the wasteland there. I got 55 silver dollars. I also robbed the Gu family on Zhongxing Road and got five silver dollars. I also robbed the Jiang family on Haichang Road and got seven silver dollars. I also robbed someone in Caojiadu once but didn't get any loot. (4) Hong Fakuan confessed: I am 33 years old. In July, I robbed the Gu family on Zhongxing Road and got five silver dollars. I also robbed Anjili on Haichang Road and got four silver dollars. In the case of robbing a pedestrian on Song Park Road, I got 35 silver dollars. I didn't get any money from the robbery in Caojiadu. Recently, we planned to rob the security team opposite the Gonghe Road, but it didn't work out. The seized handgun belongs to Cai Chengming. Meng Wuban and Mao Laoer were going to the concession to commit crimes and took it away. There is also one that belongs to Zhang Fuhua. (5) Xu Liangtu confessed: I am 27 years old. Two months ago, Zhang Fuhua and Li Shuyuan and I, because we had no food to eat, robbed a Chongming man's family in the countryside of Caojiadu. We also robbed a pedestrian sitting in a rickshaw on Song Park Road. I rode the bicycle and watched for the wind in front while they were committing the robbery. I got 40 silver dollars. (6) Li Qingguo confessed: I am 29 years old and run a night soil business. Li Shuhua is my younger brother. I don't know that he is a robber, and we don't live together. (7) Li Xiaosanzi confessed: I am 17 years old and sweep alleys. Li Qingguo is my cousin and lives in my house. Li Qinghua is Li Qingguo's older brother. I don't know if they are robbers. Yesterday, they brought a handgun and put it in my house. I didn't allow it, so they took it and hid it in an empty room at number 9, took it out from underground. (8) Sun Zhao confessed: I am 15 years old and live in Li Xiaosanzi's house. My husband's name is Sun Jixian, and he is currently a substitute squad leader in the 12th squad of the security team. Li Qinghua's older brother lives with us. I don't know about their robbing. Yesterday, they arrested them and arrested me too. (9) Xu Xia confessed: I am 33 years old this year. Because I don't have a husband and no one to rely on, I live with Xu Liangtu. It hasn't been a few days, and I don't know that he is a robber. The above confessions of the suspects were taken. Except for Sun Zhao, who is from Yangzhou, and Xu Xia, who is from Shaoxing, the rest are from Yancheng. It is also learned that the stolen goods from the various cases committed by the thieves have been identified by the original investigator, Zhongda, who summoned the victims to identify the stolen goods and verify the robbery. A document has been prepared and submitted to the Xinzha branch and transferred to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Wang Quan Qu Ying Extortion Case, Three Extortion Cases Were Solved, and the Perpetrators Were Sentenced in Court</h3>
<p>Liang Linzhang and Ni Guoxiang's Attempts to Shift Blame Were Futile; Liang Sentenced to One Year and Two Months, Ni to One Year and Six Months</p>
<p>Liang Linzhang, a Cantonese resident of No. 62, Hengde Lane, Hart Road, and Ni Guoxiang, a native of Haimen working as a tea server at Zhang Yougu's house, No. 60, Hart Road, were suspected of writing threatening letters to Wang Quan Qu Ying, a female instructor at Nanjing Jinling University residing at No. 54 in the same lane, demanding 5,000 yuan. They were arrested by Chinese detectives Zhu Mengwei, Gao Huixian, He Errui, and others from the Gordon Road Police Station and brought to the First Special Court for interrogation. This matter has been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that during the postponement of the case, after a thorough investigation by Chinese and foreign detectives handling the case, it was discovered that Liang and Ni had been plotting to write threatening letters for a long time. Because they were neighbors, they secretly met to discuss plans to extort money. On July 28th of this year, they wrote a threatening letter and sent it to the Shanghai Bank branch on Yuyuan Road, demanding 5,000 yuan and arranging a meeting at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Hart Road. If their demands were not met, they threatened to use bombs or gather more than 20 accomplices to rob the bank. On August 12th, they sent a letter to Li Xingsheng, an assistant at the Public Concession's dispatch office residing at No. 30 in the same lane, extorting 5,000 yuan, threatening to kill his entire family if he refused to pay. On August 29th, they sent a letter to Zhang Shunian, the president of Xinhua Bank on Jing'an Temple Road, demanding 30,000 yuan, arranging a meeting in front of the New World Hotel, threatening to rob the bank and assassinate the president if their demands were not met. After receiving the letters, the victims reported to the police station one after another, requesting investigation. It was not until Liang and Ni were arrested for threatening Wang Quan Qu Ying that the police discovered that the above cases were also committed by them. The handwriting on the threatening letters was also found to be from Liang Linzhang. Yesterday morning, Liang and Ni were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court for further interrogation. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the above circumstances and requested that they be punished according to Article 346, Section 3 of the Criminal Law. Subsequently, Bao Zhengrun, the manager of the Shanghai Bank's Yuyuan Road branch, and Hua Xiehe, the representative of Xinhua Bank's president Zhang Shunian, submitted cases to prove the circumstances of receiving the letters and reporting to the police. When questioned, Liang Linzhang confessed that the matter was initiated and drafted by Ni Guoxiang, who instructed him to copy and deliver the letters. Because he had just arrived in Shanghai from Guangdong and was unfamiliar with the Shanghai dialect, he followed Ni's instructions. Ni Guoxiang only admitted to participating in the Wang Quan Qu Ying extortion case, claiming that he drafted the letter but denied any involvement in the other cases. After reviewing the confessions, Judge Liu Yugui sentenced Liang Linzhang in court to one year and two months in prison for continuous joint attempted extortion, and Ni Guoxiang to one year and six months for the same crime. The threatening letters were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Zhou Ronggen, Sailor on a Salt Smuggling Enforcement Vessel, Extorts Money from a Respectable Woman, Abusing His Power to the Extreme</h3>
<p>Yu Zhao, a 42-year-old woman from Shaoxing, residing at No. 258, Minguo Road, whose husband, Yu Axiao, is a carpenter, was watching a play at the Little World with two young female friends at 10:30 pm the night before last. Zhou Ronggen (also known as Tang Youxi and Ai San), a native of Ningbo working as a sailor on a salt smuggling enforcement vessel for the Ministry of Finance, was also watching the play. He mistook Yu Zhao for a prostitute and demanded 10 yuan from her, threatening to arrest her and hand her over to the authorities if she refused. Yu Zhao and her friends were terrified and told him that they were respectable people and not to make a mistake. Zhou Ronggen threatened to show them what he was capable of outside, appearing ready to resort to violence. Yu Zhao, feeling panicked, reported the incident to Constable Duan Deshun, who questioned Zhou Ronggen. Unexpectedly, Zhou Ronggen was unreasonable and abusive, relying on his power. Duan Deshun arrested him and brought him to the Yimiao Police Station for investigation. After questioning, Police Chief Liu found that Yu Zhao had accused the defendant of abusing his power and engaging in extreme fraud. He ordered that Zhou Ronggen be transferred to the General Bureau for further investigation and punishment.</p>
<h3>Women's Education Center Hosts Women's Book Exhibition, Guo Sisters' Calligraphy Supports Fundraising</h3>
<p>The Women's Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition organized by the Municipal Women's Education Center has been in preparation since mid-last month. Since sending letters to various parties to solicit paintings and calligraphy, a large number of submissions have been received. As of yesterday, a total of 198 submissions comprising 225 pieces have been received, all from female artists, totaling more than 70 people. Works such as Ms. He Xiangning, member of the Central Committee, of Songju [pine and chrysanthemum], Ms. Lu Xiaoman, wife of Xu Zhimo, of Landscapes, are all quite valuable. The calligraphy of the Guo sisters, the female figures and flowers of Zhang Yuzhi and Bao Qiongzhi, and the Western paintings of Zhou Lihua are also rare. Preparations are now complete, and the exhibition is officially open today, with exhibits displayed in five rooms.</p>
<p>The Guo family of Ganxi has been known for painting and calligraphy for generations. Many of their descendants are skilled in this area. The Municipal Women's Education Center is holding a painting and calligraphy exhibition, and three young Guo sisters, Zhi, Ren, and Yong, have also submitted their works to participate. It is said that they are only sixteen or seventeen years old and have a considerable level of knowledge in both modern and traditional studies. They are particularly talented in art and have a special interest in painting and calligraphy. In recent years, they have been mentored by Yu Youren and Xia Jiancheng, and their progress has been rapid. Yesterday, they went to the Women's Education Painting Exhibition to participate. Their works include regular script, cursive script, official script, seal script, landscapes, and flowers, all beautifully arranged and a feast for the eyes. Their style not only lacks the soft weakness of female figures but also carries the heroic spirit of a man, which is truly commendable. The ladies are holding a charity in their hearts and wish to donate all the proceeds from the sale of paintings and calligraphy at the exhibition to fundraising.</p>
<h3>National Trade Association Visited Lianhua Woolen Mill Yesterday</h3>
<p>Sound Organization… Complete Equipment</p>
<p>In recent years, the national goods industry has developed rapidly, but due to the lack of a complete organization, it is often difficult to contact and cooperate with foreign merchants for production and sales and to open up overseas markets, resulting in missed opportunities. The China International Trade Association on Difeng Road in this city has recognized this and initiated the formation of an inspection team to visit various industrial groups and factories in the city to facilitate preliminary contact and understanding in preparation for competing in overseas markets. Yesterday (the 7th) at 2 p.m., the association sent Zhang Shenzhi, Que Yichao, Xue Ren, Cheng Zuyao, and others to visit the Lianhua Woolen Mill on North Henan Road, to inspect the various equipment and production conditions of the factory. The factory's manager, Chen Zuogan, accompanied them, providing explanations and reporting on the production and sales situation, as well as the factory's historical efforts in the international trade market. The association's visitors purchased various exquisite Three Wheels brand woolen sweaters and scarves from the factory until about 5 p.m. before bidding farewell to report to the association. It is said that the factory's 1936 swimwear is now in the process of being made, and samples are being prepared to be sent abroad.</p>
<h3>Jiuxin Enamel Factory Creates Safe Enamel Stove</h3>
<p>Shaanxi Coal Briquettes Are Also Very Convenient, A Home with One Is a Boon Against the Cold</p>
<p>Coal briquette stoves are most common in the north, and almost every household has one because they are inexpensive and convenient to use. In recent years, they have become popular in Shanghai, but sometimes the air does not circulate properly, and carbon dioxide gas remains in the room, which can suffocate people to death. This is a major flaw in the safety of the stove's construction. The Jiuxin Enamel Factory in Nanshi of this city has created a safe enamel coal briquette stove with a legitimate device that eliminates the risk of poisoning. It is coated with enamel, making it clean and beautiful, and it is also extremely convenient to use the heat to cook food and boil water. As the weather is getting colder and stoves are needed, this economical, convenient, and safe coal briquette stove can be said to be a boon against the cold for the masses. The factory also has various enamel coal-saving stoves with beautiful designs and great efficiency, priced low, making them the most suitable household appliances for ordinary families.</p>
<h3>Huang Xianyao Forged 100,000 Yuan Note Appeal Case Heard Yesterday, Li Mucheng and Three Other Households Appealed Unsatisfied, Both Courts Must Retrieve Original Records</h3>
<p>The First Instance Process</p>
<p>Huang Xianyao, the 31-year-old second son of the late tycoon Huang Chu Jiu, currently residing at No. 53, Rue Pu Shi, French Concession, practices at the China-West Pharmacy. Previously, in an attempt to defraud his father-in-law Zhou Songqing, he colluded with lawyer Mi Jingshen and assistant Wu Jiajin to forge a note stating that Zhou Songqing was holding Huang's property, and that after the matter was concluded, Xianyao's (i.e., Xianyao's) branch should receive 100,000 yuan for independent management. He first submitted it to the Shanghai District Court, requesting mediation with Zhou, but it failed and was shelved. Later, Wang Shaozeng, a creditor of the Gongfa Company, learned of this and obtained a photo of the note. He then filed a private prosecution against Huang Xianyao and Zhou Songqing in the Second Special Court's Criminal Division for destroying creditors' rights, requesting an investigation. Subsequently, six other households, including creditors Shui Jiantang, Shui Cuifeng, Cheng Kefan, Li Zhongxiang, Shui Taiji, and Li Mucheng, joined the private prosecution. Because the defendant Huang Xianyao failed to appear after being summoned, a warrant was issued for his arrest. Later, the court sent personnel to authenticate the photo of the note, and it was recognized as being written by Zhou Songqing, but Zhou firmly denied it. After the court retrieved the original note from the safe deposit box at the Guohua Bank, Zhou Songqing immediately filed a lawsuit with the French police station accusing Huang Xianyao of forging documents. The French police department took Huang into custody for investigation, and Police Vice-Director Rao Boze authenticated the note, confirming that it was not written by Zhou. Huang also confessed that Mi Jingshen, Wu Jiajin, and others had arranged for the writing of the note. The French police department then filed a public prosecution against Huang Xianyao, Mi Jingshen, Wu Jiajin, and others for forging documents, and the private prosecution was suspended. Subsequently, the public prosecution court sentenced Huang Xianyao to one year in prison, suspended for two years. After the sentence was finalized, the private prosecution was continued. As a result, based on the public prosecution's trial process and the authentication report, Huang Xianyao and Zhou Songqing were found not guilty. Later, other creditors filed a lawsuit with the Shanghai District Court accusing Huang and Zhou of destroying evidence and perjury. The case has been concluded, and it has been ruled inadmissible. The details have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper.</p>
<p>Three Creditors Appeal</p>
<p>The creditors Li Mucheng, Li Zhongxiang, and Cheng Kefan expressed dissatisfaction with the Second Special Court's judgment on the private prosecution. They presented reasons and submitted a statement to the Second Special Court's collegiate panel to file an appeal. Yesterday at 3:30 p.m., Judge Zhang Chaozuo opened an investigative court to hear the case. Only the appellant Cheng Kefan, accompanied by his attorney, and Dong Yu, the attorney for Li Zhongxiang and Li Mucheng, appeared in court. The appellees Huang Xianyao and Zhou Songqing also appeared in court with their attorneys Wu Zhiping and Fang Jiazhen. The court first questioned both parties about their ages and origins. According to the appellant Cheng Kefan, he had deposited 3,500 yuan into the Riyue Bank. After seeing the newspaper report about Wang Shaozeng's private prosecution against the appellees for concealing 100,000 yuan in assets, he also joined the private prosecution. The reasons for the appeal are that the original judgment was based on the public prosecution judgment, citing a letter from Wu Jiajin, which recognized the note as forged, but Wu's handwriting was not verified. Moreover, the note had undergone mediation, so it could not be forged. The first instance judgment found the appellees not guilty, so he was dissatisfied and filed an appeal. Cheng's attorney continued, stating that Huang Xianyao had confessed in the original trial that the note was written by Mi Jingshen and Wu Jiajin, but Mi and Wu were not summoned to testify. Now, the appellant has learned that Mi Jingshen is now in Shanghai, residing in Room 10, Dongfang Apartment, Beile Road, and requested that he be summoned. Dong Yu, the attorney for the appellants Li Mucheng and Li Zhongxiang, stated the reasons for the appeal, saying that the handwriting of the 100,000 yuan note had been authenticated in the original trial and matched the handwriting in Zhou's ledger. Later, based on the authentication of a foreign detective in the public prosecution case who did not understand Chinese literature, and ignoring the key points of Huang Xianyao's confession, a judgment was made without further investigation. The appellants believe that this is unacceptable and have filed an appeal, requesting a detailed investigation and requesting that the Gongfa Company's ledger be retrieved from the Gongfa Company's liquidator, accountant Pan Qibang, to verify the handwriting.</p>
<p>Statements of Huang and Zhou</p>
<p>When questioned, Huang Xianyao stated that the note had been authenticated in both the private and public prosecution cases, requesting that the authentication reports be verified. Zhou Songqing is my father-in-law. I first entrusted lawyer Mi Jingshen to handle the case of cohabitation with my wife. Mi and Wu Jiajin suggested that because I wanted to live with my wife but had no money, I should get some money from my father-in-law. Wu Jiajin then asked someone to write the note and requested mediation at the district court, but it failed. They told me to sue again, but I was unwilling. Later, Tang Shouchun asked me for money, but I refused, so he put the note in a safe deposit box and colluded with the creditors to sue me. To investigate the person who wrote this note, it is only necessary to summon Wu Jiajin, and it will be clear. This note is indeed forged. Wu Jiajin wrote me a letter guaranteeing his testimony. This letter is now in the public prosecution case. Please summon Tang Shouchun and Zhu Zishou to testify. Zhou Songqing stated that he did not write this note. Moreover, Huang Chu Jiu never had any money, as everyone knows. This note is completely forged. Xianyao listened to bad people's instigation and requested mediation at the district court. I originally wanted to pursue the matter, but Xianyao's mother and my daughter pleaded with me, so I did not investigate deeply, which led to the current entanglement. How could such an important matter as 100,000 yuan be written on a mere note? The note has been clearly authenticated and is definitely forged. The original trial was very fair. The appellants' appeal shows that they are fond of litigation. Please reject the appeal and uphold the original judgment based on the facts and evidence. Zhou's attorney, Wu Zhiping, stated that the appellants' attorney said that the original trial adopted the authentication of a foreigner who did not understand Chinese literature, which was insufficient to convince. However, the authentication report of the original trial was also inconsistent, and the court should pay attention to this. According to Huang Xianyao's defense attorney, regarding the 100,000 yuan note, the public prosecution had already ruled, and Huang Xianyao had been sentenced to imprisonment, which has been finalized. Therefore, this case has already been concluded. At the end, the lawyers for both sides expressed their opinions. The court ordered that the case file be retrieved from the Shanghai District Court, and the District Court also retrieved the case file from this court. After the case files are retrieved, a hearing will be scheduled. The court was then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Yu Xijin Places Rocks on Railway Tracks</h3>
<p>The Jinghu Railway police discovered a young man on the afternoon of the day before yesterday picking up stones from the roadside and placing them on the tracks, for unknown reasons. The railway police immediately arrested the young man and found eight stones, which were brought to the police station together. During interrogation, he identified himself as Yu Xijin, 21 years old, from Wuxi, and repeatedly denied the act, claiming that the stones were placed by children in the countryside. Considering the importance of the railway tracks, such acts of mischief are not allowed. If a thorough investigation is not carried out strictly, how can the safety of travelers be ensured? Therefore, yesterday, a police officer was dispatched with a written order to transfer the suspect Yu Xijin, along with the eight stones, to the District Court for questioning and legal action.</p>

<p>Datong News Agency reports that the Taigu New Beijing Ship sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo at 5 p.m. on the 4th. At midnight that day, the ship was passing through the waters of Daji Mountain when another young passenger committed suicide by jumping into the sea. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Suicide by Jumping into the Sea at Midnight: The New Beijing Ship left Shanghai for Ningbo at 5 p.m. on the 4th.

The passenger claimed to be unwell and did not eat. He then changed into a bathrobe and went to sleep. At about 11 p.m. midnight, he left his bunk and went outside. The tea attendant Zhang Shide, who was in charge of the cabin, thought he was going to the toilet. However, he did not return for a long time. He was searched, and a bathrobe and shoes were found abandoned on the side of the ship, which confirmed that he had committed suicide by jumping into the sea.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Remains: The incident was reported to the purser, who inspected the remains. They included a suitcase (full of clothes), leather shoes, a harmonica, and loose banknotes and silver coins, as well as six letters of testament. After reading them, it was learned that the deceased's name was Hong Yaoyu, 22 years old, from Hongtang Town, Cixi, and that he worked at the Baocheng Gongji Silver Shop on Rue Fada in this city. The letters were all written with addresses and have been sent separately by the ship's tea attendant. The content of the letters cannot be recorded, but it is known that they were addressed to his mother, his sister, Ye Zhuotang, the Baocheng Silver Shop, his uncle, and one letter was left for the ship's staff.</p>
<p>Complaints and Resentment in the Will: The following is an excerpt from his letter to the ship's staff: "To whom it may concern: I have been forced to jump into the sea because of the harm caused by my uncle. Please deliver the belongings left behind to Hong Yaoshan's home in Hongtang Old Residence, Ningbo. I will repay your kindness in the next life. Thank you for your trouble. Sincerely, I wish you a pleasant winter. To all the gentlemen in charge, Hong Yaoyu's last words."</p>
<h3>Should Shipping Notices and Other Items Be Affixed with Stamps? Bean and Rice Industry Requests Explanation</h3>
<p>Dagong News Agency reports that the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association has requested the former Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau to exempt the shipping notices, bale sheets, and rice straw sheets used by its members from stamp duty. Since the promulgation of the new Stamp Tax Law, inspectors have also inspected and punished these items, causing great panic among members. Therefore, the association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting the Ministry of Finance to provide an explanation, and separately sent letters to the court and the Municipal Public Security Bureau to suspend enforcement. The original letter and notice are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: "We respectfully inform you that the shipping notices, bale sheets, and rice straw sheets used by our association members have always been used for notification and verification of quantities, and their nature does not belong to the category of loan tickets and receipts. They were approved by the former Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau in the 20th year of the Republic of China to be exempt from stamp duty. The Stamp Tax Law implemented on September 1st of this year, according to Article (blank) Section 9, should also not be subject to stamp duty. However, fearing misunderstandings during the change, inspectors may misunderstand. On August 23rd, we prepared a letter explaining the reasons, attaching samples of the above three types of notes, and requested your association to interpret and reply. We received a reply stating that the proposal to maintain the exemption from stamp duty for shipping notices, etc., has been forwarded to the Ministry of Finance for approval, etc. Unexpectedly, while awaiting approval from the Ministry, stamp inspectors have been inspecting the use of these notes and imposing penalties from the court. If an explanation is not given promptly and clearly, the damage to members will be immeasurable. We are requesting your association to telegraph the Ministry for approval and follow the instructions. We have also separately sent letters to the Public Security Bureau and the District Court to suspend inspections and penalties before the Ministry's approval is received. Respectfully, Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association."</p>
<p>Notice to Members: "We respectfully inform you that the shipping notices, bale sheets, and rice straw sheets used by members have always been approved by the former Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau in the 20th year of the Republic of China to be exempt. According to Article 3, Section 9 of the current Stamp Tax Law, demanding overdue payments or verifying the number of account statements, is exempt from stamp duty, which is consistent with the regulations and should not be subject to stamp duty. However, for the sake of caution, the association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting that it be forwarded to the Ministry for explanation, but approval has not yet been received. Stamp inspectors have been inspecting these notes and forwarding them to the court for penalty. The association specifically sent another letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, requesting that it immediately telegraph the Ministry for approval, and separately sent letters to the Public Security Bureau and the District Court to suspend inspections and penalties before the Ministry's approval is received. Please take note of this notice. December 7, 24th year of the Republic of China."</p>

At this time of currency inflation, the prices of raw materials continue to rise, and the cost of capital is excessively high, making it increasingly difficult to sustain operations. If we do not promptly devise remedies, we will be on the verge of collapse. The current reorganization of the association is aimed at overcoming difficulties, revitalizing the business of colleagues, and promoting benefits. Adjusting dyeing prices externally and revising industry regulations internally are serious tasks and significant responsibilities. As a pillar of our industry, you have long enjoyed popular support. You have been known for resolving difficulties and disputes without complaint, and you possess a deep enthusiasm that we all admire. It has been unanimously decided at the discussion meeting held on November 28th that "the initial reorganization involves numerous complexities, and we rely on your talent to grasp the key points. We cannot bear to see a veteran general retire into seclusion, seeking only peace. We unanimously support your coming out of retirement, relying on your planning to courageously accept the difficulties." We have specially dispatched Tan Borong and Hu Xiongqing to deliver a letter, urging you to take office and assist in the work. For the sake of the "industry" and "hometown," create benefits for "colleagues." For the sake of "friendship" and "self," seek benefits. Public and private sentiments intersect, which will truly benefit the overall plan. We humbly request that you grant our request in order to save the declining industry. We await with anticipation.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, I am writing in response to the article "Fashion Workers Go on Strike; Gao De and Others Petition Party and Government Agencies" published in your newspaper yesterday (6th). I have been separated from popular movements for a long time and am now engaged in scientific endeavors. The mention of my name may be based on inaccurate rumors. I am deeply concerned that various circles may misunderstand. I hope you will correct the record. Sincerely, Gao De, December 6. Esteemed Editor, We are writing in response to the news report published in your newspaper about our company's passenger, Song Kanbu, being robbed and filing a lawsuit. The facts stated in the report are not entirely accurate. The passenger checked into our hotel on November 30th, accompanied by several companions. It was not until the afternoon of the next day that he suddenly claimed that items were missing from his rattan bag, not in the morning. On December 3rd, when the hotel reported the incident to the Zhabei Police Station, the police repeatedly advised us to give 60 yuan in order to quell the matter, which was not of our own volition. The facts are available and can be verified. We are writing to request that your newspaper make a correction to clarify the truth. Sincerely, Andong Xingji Hotel, December 7, 25th year of the Republic of China. Dear Editor, We were very surprised by a news item published by the Central News Agency in your newspaper on the 7th of this month regarding our company's preparations for the Sino-French air route. Our company's Sino-French air route has been prepared and will be completed soon, without having to wait for orders to proceed, and can be scheduled to open soon, without waiting to start in the spring. The facts are entirely fictitious, and the impact is very significant. We are writing to request that your newspaper make a correction.

<h3>Jiangsu Education Department and Shanghai Banking Industry Conclude Educational Loan</h3>
<p>Totaling 210,000 Yuan with a Monthly Interest Rate of Nine Percent Guaranteed by Wuxian Business Tax and Brokerage Tax</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government Education Department recently negotiated with the Shanghai banking industry to borrow 210,000 yuan for the relocation and construction of the Provincial Nanjing Middle School. The payment has been made yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Loan Purpose: The Jiangsu Provincial Government Education Department has established many middle schools in the province, with the Nanjing Middle School in the capital being the largest in scale. However, there is no complete middle school in Zhenjiang, the provincial capital. The department believes that the capital has many middle schools in recent times, which can accommodate students. There is no need to establish one, but in the provincial capital, there are very few complete middle schools, and residents often send their children to study in other ports. Therefore, there is a decision to relocate the Provincial Nanjing Middle School in the capital to Zhenjiang, the provincial capital. A loan of 210,000 yuan has been negotiated with the Shanghai banking industry to cover the construction costs of the school buildings.</p>
<p>Successful Negotiation: Zhou Fohai, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Department, who is a member of the Central Committee, came to Shanghai last month to negotiate a loan with the Shanghai banking industry. The loan was undertaken by seven banks: Central, China, Communications, Jin Cheng, Zhongnan, Jiangsu, and Jiangsu Farmers. After several consultations between the two parties, the progress was smooth because the amount was not large. The contract was formally signed at the end of last month. Each bank borrowed 30,000 yuan, totaling 210,000 yuan, with a monthly interest rate of 9%. Zhou immediately left Shanghai and returned to the province. It is reported that the Zhong, Zhong, and Jiao banks have telegraphed their Zhenjiang branches yesterday to make the payment on the spot.</p>
<p>One-Year Repayment: This loan will be repaid in one year. The Jiangsu Education Department will use the business tax and brokerage tax of Wuxian as the first guarantee, and the old land and property of Nanjing Middle School in the capital as the second guarantee. As for the new school buildings in Zhenjiang, the Education Department has designed and bid for construction, and it is expected to be completed within one year, at which time it can be moved in.</p>

<h3>Today's National Music Academy New Campus Completion Ceremony</h3>
<p>The National Music Academy of this city has been in operation for eight years since its founding in 1927. This spring, it finally purchased a site behind the City Hall on Shijing Road in the city center area and began construction. Now it is completed and a completion ceremony will be held today (Sunday) at 2 p.m., along with the Eighth Anniversary Student Concert. Because the school's auditorium is not yet under construction due to limited funds, the meeting will be held in the small auditorium today. Guests must present invitations to be seated, in order to restrict attendance.</p>
<p>School Building Proposal (Xiao Youmei)</p>
<p>(1) Construction Costs: When the plan to establish the Music Academy was submitted to Cai Yuanpei, President of the University Council, in October 1927, the National Government had not been established for long, and there was no guarantee of educational funding, so there was no talk of school building construction. At that time, the University Council reluctantly approved the preparations, and in addition to issuing 2,600 yuan for start-up costs, the government only promised to plan for and issue equipment fees and school site funds after the end of the civil war. From 1937 to July 1935, the school buildings were all rented private houses in the French Concession, and moved four times between 1928 and 1931. We felt that renting residential buildings was absolutely unsuitable for running a music academy, so we submitted new budgets to the government every year, requesting funds for address and construction costs. It was not until 1934 that one-fifth (i.e., 80,000 yuan) of our requested 400,000 yuan was approved. Because this meager 80,000 yuan was insufficient for building a proper school building, a request for an increase in the budget was submitted in 1934, and an additional 40,000 yuan was approved, but only 20,000 yuan had been received as of November of this year.</p>
<p>(2) Selection of School Site: Before 1933, the school affairs meeting had passed a resolution to purchase a site near Zhaofeng Park in the city for the school's base. However, due to the high land price there, it was impossible to purchase it. Later, the 52nd school affairs meeting overturned the resolution and decided to build in the city center. Since the City Hall and various bureaus moved there, and there are also great buildings such as libraries, museums, sports fields, and city hospitals, everyone recognizes that the area is the cultural district of Shanghai. Therefore, the school affairs meeting recently overturned the old plan, and not only did the school's colleagues have no objection, but it was deeply approved by the Ministry of Education and the City Government. The school originally planned to take 30 mu of land, but because it could not pay the land price in full at one time, it temporarily took 16 mu at the end of Shijing Road (behind the City Hall), paid one-quarter of the land price first, and the remainder was to be paid in three years. There was no road there, but after the school paid the land price, the City Government ordered the Bureau of Public Works to specially open a new road for it (i.e., the eastern section of Shijing Road), and also ordered the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to install water pipes and utility poles, so the school had water and electricity soon after construction started. For this point alone, the school expresses its gratitude to the City Government.</p>
<p>(3) First Phase of Construction Plan: The school's construction is carried out in two phases, and architect Mr. Luo Bangjie is commissioned to design and supervise the construction. The estimated cost of the first phase of the construction plan is approximately as follows: (1) Land of approximately 16 mu, approximately 39,290.00 yuan, (2) One main school building (excluding the auditorium), including heating pipes, sanitary equipment, electrical engineering, school roads, and sewers, approximately 87,192.69 yuan, (3) Two practice rooms (17 rooms each), including electrical engineering, approximately 15,900.00 yuan, (4) One dormitory each for male and female students, including sanitary equipment and electrical engineering, approximately 35,600.00 yuan, (5) South-facing wall, 1,985.85 yuan, (6) One kitchen, 800.00 yuan, (7) Architect's design and supervision fees (calculated at 4%), approximately 5,658.46 yuan, (8) Backfilling, approximately 5,000.00 yuan, (9) Cement pillars and bamboo fences on the east, west, and north sides, approximately 3,573.00 yuan, (10) Planting grass and trees, approximately 5,000.00 yuan. The total cost is approximately 200,000 yuan or more. The first phase of the plan is not very large, but it is impossible to fully realize it with only the 100,000 yuan received. Fortunately, Master Yang Sen of Sichuan donated 10,000 yuan to the school for land costs, so the school was able to pay one-quarter of the land fee. In addition, the school's savings from past years, together with sporadic donations, are sufficient to build a practice room. Therefore, during this construction period, only one main school building, two practice rooms, the wall, and the kitchen can be completely completed. Although the women's dormitory has been started, there is no guarantee that it can be completed without funds. Other items such as architect's fees, backfilling, and bamboo fences can only be partially paid for. As for the men's dormitory, it is impossible to start construction, and planting grass and trees is out of the question. In short, to complete the first phase of the school's construction plan (including land price), another 60,000 yuan is needed. We sincerely hope that the government will issue another picture of the front of the new Music Academy school building in the near future, and especially hope that people in society will donate generously. The most important thing about the construction of music school buildings is soundproofing. The school's main building was originally planned to be built with three layers of reinforced concrete, but because the cost was too high, and could not be done without 140,000 or 150,000 yuan, it was changed to three "false" layers, so there is no absolute soundproofing between the second and third floors. The classrooms on the first and second floors can only use cheaper soundproofing equipment, because of economic limitations.</p>
<p>(4) Second Phase of Construction Plan: As for the second phase of the school's construction plan, it includes the following items: (1) 14 mu of land (purchased behind the school), (2) One auditorium, (3) Two more dormitories each for men and women, (4) Two practice rooms, (5) One library, (6) One gymnasium, (7) One faculty dormitory, (8) Four residences for the principal and directors, (9) Architect's design and supervision fees, (10) Backfilling, school roads, sewers, planting grass and trees, (11) Bamboo fences. Whether 200,000 yuan can be used to handle all of the above items is still unknown, but we must have a complete plan. If the economy does not allow it to be realized at the same time, we have to proceed step by step. We deeply hope that music lovers inside and outside the school will work hard to help, so that the school's construction plan can be completed as soon as possible, and music education can be revived, which will have a significant impact on our country's cultural future.</p>
<p>School History, by Fu Shu</p>
<p>Our country's music education has never received special attention. At best, music departments are only appendages of various schools. The establishment of our country's music academies started with this school. The author dares not use this statement to boast, nor dares to be complacent about it, but the difficulty of creation is worth mentioning, so I write this brief history to inform the people of the country. Before the summer vacation of 1927, the music education entrusted to the Music Training Institute attached to Peking University and the Music Department of the Art Academy were both in danger of being destroyed along with the proposal to merge the nine national schools. Fortunately, our National Government was established in Nanjing, and thanks to the wisdom of the authorities, the plan to establish the National Music Academy proposed by Mr. Xiao Youmei was approved, and Mr. Xiao was the chief preparer. However, at that time, the government was focusing on the Northern Expedition, and the national treasury was quite stretched, so only 2,600 yuan was allocated for preparatory expenses to cover all equipment and housing costs. After many difficulties, a school building was rented on Route Paul Henry, and it was named the National Music Academy, with Cai Yuanpei, President of the University Council, concurrently serving as the President. Enrollment was held in early November, and the opening ceremony was held on the 27th of the same month. Thus, the Music Academy, which was unprecedented in China, was officially established. However, because enrollment was too late, only 22 students were admitted the first time. In December of that year, President Cai, due to the many affairs of the University Council, had no time to take care of it, so he specially entrusted Mr. Xiao Youmei, the Dean of Academic Affairs of the Academy, to act as the President of the Academy.</p>
<p>In February 1928, new students were added, and the total number of new and old students was about 56. The school moved to Avenue Joffre and added dormitories. In June of the same year, a new budget for 1928 was submitted and approved by the University Council. From September, the monthly expenses increased to 5,000 yuan, and the number of students also increased to 80. In August of the same year, the school moved again to Rue Pichon and rented a house in Taoyuan Village on Avenue Lafayette, which was the third move of the school. In September, the University Council appointed Mr. Xiao as the President of the Academy.</p>
<p>In July 1929, the National Government amended the University Organization Law. Because the organization law did not have provisions for music and art academies, it ordered the reorganization of the Hangzhou Art Academy into an art academy and this academy into a music academy. Mr. Xiao resigned from his position as President of the Academy to the Ministry of Education. In August, the Ministry of Education reappointed Mr. Xiao as the President of the school, until now. The Music Academy initially had preparatory courses, specialized courses, elective courses, and special elective courses. The preparatory course was a preparation for the elective course and required 60 credits to graduate. The purpose of the specialized course was to train music teachers and required 100 credits. The elective course was designed for those who specialize in one subject and was divided into elementary, middle, and high levels, with 10 credits as the standard for each level. The special elective course was designed for those who aspire to study music but are limited by regulations or are left out due to full quotas and cannot be inserted into each class. Teachers charge different tuition fees for each class, but the selected courses generally attend classes with other classes, so the level is no different from the elective courses. After the reorganization in August 1929, the Ministry of Education ordered that the specialized course be changed to a normal course. In August of the same year, Mr. Shen Zhongjun was hired as the Director of General Affairs. In October, Ms. Hu Zhou Shuan was hired as the Director of the Vocal Music Department, Mr. Zakharoff (disciple of Mr. B. Zakharoff Godowsky, Russian) as the Director of the Piano Department, and Mr. A. Foa (Italian) as the Director of the Violin Department. The vocal music, piano, and violin departments were formally established. At the same time, Mr. Huang Zi, a Bachelor of Music from Yale University, was hired as a theory teacher, and the school affairs were revitalized. In December, the school signed a contract with the Shanghai Commercial Press to publish the school's series of books and the Music Art Quarterly.</p>
<p>In February 1930, the school established a cello department and hired Mr. Shevtzpff (Russian) as the Director of the Cello Department. At that time, because the school's students were progressing very quickly, a research department was added, which was later renamed the research class by order of the Ministry of Education in May. Previously, the school did not have many students, and the academic affairs were relatively simple, so the position of Dean of Academic Affairs was concurrently held by President Xiao. From August of the same year, Mr. Huang Zi was hired as the Dean of Academic Affairs to be solely responsible. In September, the Theory and Composition Department was established, and President Xiao concurrently served as the Director of the Department. Mr. Liao Qingzhu was hired as the editor of the Music Art Quarterly. The first issue was published in April of that year. The school's series of books were also published one after another. The school's affairs had entered the right track, but the school building on Rue Pichon was taken back by the owner in August 1931, so the school moved again to Avenue Lafayette. This was the fourth move of the school. In October of the same year, the Ministry of Education ordered that the preparatory course be changed to a high school class, and the normal course be changed to a high school normal course, both accepting high school graduates. Each department of the undergraduate course was changed to a group, and a normal group was added to the undergraduate course. Graduates of the high school normal course can be promoted to the undergraduate course if they wish to continue their studies, but the number of credits they must complete is set at 40. The remaining theory and composition, piano, violin, cello, vocal music, and Chinese music groups of the undergraduate course must complete 80 credits to graduate. In October of the same year, a refresher course was also established, enrolling beginners in music, taught by normal students for practice. In that year, six kinds of school books had been published. When the January 28th Incident broke out, the school's series of books on harmony and the seventh issue of the Music Art Quarterly were destroyed by artillery fire along with the Commercial Press. The school's publishing plan had to be temporarily suspended. At the same time, because the unpaid expenses had reached four months, the school affairs meeting decided to suspend the dormitory from February. Since then, the school struggled to support itself in the storm. When the overall situation stabilized slightly in 1933, the school's series of books continued to be published at the Commercial Press. As of now, 19 kinds have been published, and there are still six kinds in print. In the same year, the school's staff and students, seeing the need to form a society, reorganized the former Music Art Society, and invited Mr. Cai Yuanpei and Mr. Ye Xia'an to be the presidents. After its establishment, the first plan was to publish a music magazine. After many twists and turns, it was published in Liangyou Company in 1934.</p>
<p>In July 1934, the Director of General Affairs, Mr. Shen Zhongjun, resigned due to personal reasons, and Mr. Chen Nengfang succeeded him. Since then, the school has developed all school affairs, and has tried its best to build school buildings. The school's request for temporary expenses was approved by the Central Political Council for 80,000 yuan. The school used this fund and the 11,200 yuan raised over the years to purchase 16 mu of land on Shijing Road in the city center of Shanghai this spring to build school buildings. However, it was ultimately limited by funds. Currently, only the main school building and the west practice room and the east practice room have been completed, and the women's dormitory is still under construction (before the dormitory is completed, this year, six post office buildings were temporarily rented in Youting Lane on Shilin Road in the city center for use as male and female dormitories). The construction costs for other buildings such as the men's dormitory, library, and gymnasium are still to be raised.</p>
<p>This autumn, the school started with a new life. The school's organization outline and school regulations were revised. The piano group, including the organ, was changed to the keyboard instrument group. The violin group and the cello group were merged into the orchestra instrument group. Mr. Farriguo was the director of the group. At the same time, the Student Affairs Office was formally established (previously, the student affairs were handled by the Student Affairs Committee), and Mr. Huang Guoliang was hired as the acting Director of Student Affairs. In addition, Mr. Li Weining, Mr. Wu Bochao, and Ms. Xiao Shuxian were hired as teachers of the school. All three teachers studied in Europe and returned with honors. In order to popularize music education, the school recruited students from all provinces and regions this academic year. As a result, as many as 15 provinces and regions were recommended by the provincial education halls to take the exam. Gansu and Shaanxi, which have never had anyone come to study, also sent people to take the exam. From now on, there is hope that music teachers will gradually become popular. In terms of professors, the fixed pitch name method is implemented. Elementary vocal music and piano are taught in the whole class, which belongs to the new experiment. Schools should recruit both Chinese and foreign students. The school has also been instructed by the Ministry of Education to generously admit students. Therefore, in February 1932, nearly 20 foreign students applied for the exam. However, the school has limited places and cannot admit too many students. Subsequently, the school affairs meeting decided to temporarily set the number of foreign students to one-tenth of the total number of students. This year, it was changed to two students per group, and there were quite a few people who were left out due to full quotas. It can be seen that the school is valued by Chinese and foreign people.</p>
<p>As for the school's formally graduated students, although there are not many (three undergraduates, seven undergraduates in the normal group, two high school normal students, and two elective students), they all have considerable jobs after graduation. In addition, there is a shortage of musical talents in the country, so there are often students who study at the school for two or three years and leave to take jobs without graduating. Among the 137 students currently studying at the school, 20 or 30 are already working outside the school (or teaching in universities, vocational schools, and primary and secondary schools in this city, or composing music for film companies, or as tutors). It can be seen that the demand for musical talents exceeds the supply, so that most students leave the school to work before graduating, which is also a clear proof that those who study music do not have to worry about finding a way out.</p>

Guanghua has always been at a disadvantage. It is fortunate that it was not defeated. After entering the game, both sides kicked off, and their actions were out of line. It seems that this is not an evil habit that people in higher education should have. Moreover, students watching from the sidelines should not hiss and shout. I hope you will pay more attention to this in the future. Here is a record of the game.</p>
<p>Ratio Melee</p>
<p>Referee Shen Huichun blew the whistle to start the game. Guanghua kicked off first. Within a minute, Jinan committed a foul and was awarded a free kick. It was intercepted in the middle and launched a major attack. One pass and one block, the momentum was vast. Guanghua's inner guards were strong. After receiving the ball, they resumed the advance and attacked section by section. The two sides fought in melee for a long time, each without success. After the winter rain, the ground was slightly slippery. Guanghua took advantage of the terrain and frequently oppressed. Before long, Jinan was familiar with the ground and bravely moved forward, repeatedly attacking in front of Guanghua's goal. The situation was very dangerous. After that, the ball often hovered in Guanghua's hinterland. Fortunately, Guanghua's inner guards ran around to deal with it and were spared. Guanghua occasionally got a chance and launched a counterattack, but unfortunately the forwards were weak and could not use it, and missed it. Dong Shuzhao left the field due to injury. Although Jinan's defenders were brave and good at fighting, the cooperation of the forwards was poor, often delaying and missing, or the connection was inaccurate, or the position was uneven, and there were very few opportunities to kick the goal. The first half ended with zero to zero.</p>
<p>Jinan Misses Opportunity</p>
<p>After changing places, everyone believed that Jinan would win. After kicking off, it drove straight in, and its arrogance was terrifying. Guanghua's defender Zhao Aisheng kicked his feet into the air, but Jinan's response was ineffective and failed to achieve anything. It attacked again and again, but still had no chance. It went straight to Huanglong, but Guanghua was forced to approach Jinan's goal from the left, creating a momentary panic. After that, Jinan realized that the past failures were due to too many passes on the defense line, which missed the opportunity. It changed its plan and used shooting. Sure enough, the horns of Hujia were ringing in front of Guanghua's goal. Jinan kicked more than a dozen corner kicks one after another, but they were all intercepted by Guanghua. Although Guanghua occasionally counterattacked, it was only a flash in the pan. Jinan's midfielder Liang Shutang ran all over the field and was the most hardworking. Unfortunately, Wang Nanzhen missed the opportunity in front of the goal, and Zhong Yuxiang's penalty kick was blocked. Although he cheered up and repeatedly oppressed the enemy's goal, the great opportunities all turned into fleeting clouds. As a result, the game ended with a score of zero to zero again. The lineup of the two teams is listed below.</p>

<h3>Little Men (117)</h3>
<p>— Louisa M. Alcott original Zheng Xiaocang translation</p>
<p>For a moment, Nan En's heart almost stopped; with her usual courage, thinking of a real bear, she didn't feel like a game, she was about to turn around and run away in a panic, when she suddenly heard a gentle moo, which turned her overwhelming fear into laughter. So she said:</p>
<p>"It's a cow, Robert! The good black cow we saw this afternoon."</p>
<p>The cow also felt strange how she could meet two children in her pasture at night, so this good-tempered and smart animal also stopped to find out. She let them stroke it, standing there and watching them, she showed such gentle eyes, so Nan En, who was afraid of anything but black bears, suddenly decided to get her milk.</p>
<p>"Lai Siwu taught me how to milk; berry stalks mixed with milk are so delicious," she said, and then she poured everything in her bucket into her hat, and boldly started her new job, while Robert stood beside her, following her orders, singing the following song:</p>
<p>"Fat and beautiful cow,</p>
<p>Give us five pecks of fresh milk,</p>
<p>Give us five pecks of fresh milk,</p>
<p>We also want a hundred acres of vanilla from you."</p>
<p>He sang as hard as he could, but it was still useless, because the cow's milk had just been taken, so there was only a spoonful to give to these two thirsty children.</p>

The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's announced listing showed that both the UK and the US were flat, and the situation remained stagnant. The silver equalization tax was announced as unchanged. After this, the banks' appetite for snapping up dollars varied, and the market was supported again when the electric power company and others snapped up dollars. Although Chinese merchants slightly sold, the banks maintained the price by taking advantage of the low prices. As a result, the sluggish situation was difficult to break, and there was a lack of change. The prediction for the Indian silver market was unchanged.

<h3>Securities: Government Bonds Slightly Improved</h3>
<p>22 Customs Bonds Alone Rose One Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw a gradual weakening of market conditions. With the North China incident still brewing, those who had raised prices had already given up, and major players had also begun to exit. Considering the environment and contracts together, the future was difficult to be optimistic about. Yesterday's activity consisted of four sessions. At the opening of the morning session, selling pressure for contracts #16 and #35 was initially strong, with a small difference of three or four jiao. Afterwards, buying interest for contracts #43, #46, and #58, etc., was strong, and prices were pulled up by three or five jiao. In the second session, #70 had the strongest appetite, eating up a considerable amount, and sparing no effort to raise prices. Even the unified salt tax, etc., was raised by about one yuan. At the same time, selling pressure was also strong, so the forward contract for #6 was still small, indicating that it would fall as soon as it stopped. At the opening of the afternoon session, selling pressure for contract #4 surged again, likely profiting from the high price. At the same time, North Bank also exited significantly, so the price struggled to rise, and the downward trend gradually intensified. #6 fell by 7.5 jiao. At the closing, selling pressure for #4 was sparse, and the shorts on the trading floor covered their positions. Initially, the abolition of military expenses was slightly weak, with a drop of three jiao. Afterwards, demand was relatively strong, and it gradually rose, with most recovering by six or seven jiao. This kind of rotating situation is still in the brewing stage. The result of the market price was a uniform recovery of one or two jiao to one yuan, depending on the bond. The total transaction volume was approximately 30 million yuan. The results of the increases and decreases are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan).</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Market Sentiment Leans Towards Selling</h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm. With the situation in North China becoming more peaceful, domestic yarn merchants are purchasing. However, the general sentiment of peers in the listed yarn market leans towards pessimism. Only the banking sector and gold firms absorb at low prices. The closing price of yarn for this month is up 4.4 yuan from the closing price last week.</p>
<p>Gold Difficult to Be Calm, with Undercurrents of Weakness</p>
<p>At the opening of the listed yarn market in the morning session, the prices for all months were uniformly weak, and trading in the market was sparse. As a result, market conditions softened, but the financial sector and gold firms tightened the bullish position, and the market did not see major changes. As a result, the prices for all months were down by 0.47 to 0.8 jiao compared to the closing prices of the previous day. At the opening of the afternoon session, the market atmosphere suddenly weakened, and the prices for all months fell by 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 jiao. However, Changfeng came to cover shorts again, and the market rose again in the second and third sessions. By the close, the prices for distant months had recovered slightly by a few jiao. As a result, the prices for all months were up or down by 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.6 jiao compared to the closing prices of the morning session. It was found that Daji sold 1,350 bales, Dafeng 400 bales, Gengfeng 400 bales, Yongchang 400 bales, Taixing 1,050 bales, Yuanyi 700 bales, Runkang 600 bales, Yongda 450 bales, and Xincheng 400 bales.

<p>Total |  |  |  |  | 268,050</p>
<p>Actual Sales of Over 800 Bales</p>
<p>The sales of current yarn are still not bad. It was found that various gangs bought a total of 847 bales throughout the day. The price of regular yarn rose by 0.5 jiao, and the price of thread rose by 2 yuan. The amount of purchases by various gangs is as follows:</p>
<p>Luzhou 25, Tianjin 15, Shantou 45</p>
<p>Domestic 680, Nanjing 7, Wuhu 215</p>
<p>Hankou 10, Guangdong 20, Peers 10</p>
<p>The cotton market is stable. Overseas cotton market conditions are also calm. However, the Japanese merchant Dongmian Yangxing and Tongji Dafu are constantly absorbing on behalf of the banking sector. General cotton merchants are unanimously selling off in large quantities. The future changes are difficult to predict. However, the current price of foreign cotton is about 10 yuan higher than that of domestic cotton. The closing price of cotton for this month is up 2.5 yuan from the closing price last week.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Slightly Mixed</p>
<p>At the opening of the listed cotton market in the morning session, the price for this month was still high, but the price in the middle of the month loosened, falling by 0.1 to 0.5 jiao. The prices for April and May futures rose again, and the market condition was slightly mixed. Because the Ningbo gang sold off in large quantities, Changhe and Changfeng also bought a lot. As a result, the price in the middle of the month fell slightly by 0.5 to 1 jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day. At the opening of the afternoon session, selling pressure suddenly increased. Yichang Yongbang Runkang sold off in large quantities, falling by 1.5 jiao. However, as soon as the second and third sessions arrived, Changhe continued to purchase strongly, and the market price rebounded. As a result, the price in the middle of the month rose by 0.5 to 1 jiao compared to the closing price of the morning session, and the price for distant months fell by 0.5 jiao. It was found that Meiji sold 1,900 dan, Dafeng 3,400 dan, Runkang 10,200 dan, Yikang 2,400 dan, Xincheng 3,100 dan, Changyu 1,600 dan, Yuanyi 2,800 dan, Yichang 4,000 dan, and Xiecheng 1,200 dan.

<h3>Limited New Transactions in American Cotton</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with a sluggish market. Prices rose by one to two points across various months. News from Liverpool was favorable, but due to overnight hedging and long position liquidations, the market failed to follow the upward trend. Subsequently, purchases by domestic firms and Liverpool caused prices to rise again, but sales by New Orleans and local dealers led to renewed softening. Most trading in the market was for liquidating transactions before the government report was released, with limited new activity. Domestic firms, fearing further government sales, remained hesitant and uneasy. Hester estimated factory consumption this week at 378,000 bales, and Liverpool stocks at 277,000 bales. Short covering occurred before the close, indicating a still firm trend. Spot prices remained unchanged, while futures rose by one to four points. English cotton spot prices were unchanged, while futures rose by two points. Indian cotton was sold by European exporters and Japanese traders, but this was offset by speculative buying. Pingoer remained unchanged, Omra fell by 0.25 rupees, and Bai Luo Xi rose by 0.25 rupees. The above is a telegram from New Orleans (dated the 6th).</p>

<h3>Japanese Merchants Actively Involved in Cotton Business in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The cotton market in Tianjin remains favorable. Japanese merchants are actively seeking supplies, with high prices offered for good quality cotton, while lower quality cotton remains sluggish. Wu Zhai Firm purchased 50 bales of Xihe cotton at 41.4 yuan. Matsumoto Firm purchased 190 bales at 41 yuan. Da Shang Firm purchased 50 bales at 41 yuan. Tong Fu purchased 60 bales of Donghe cotton at 50.4 yuan.

<h3>Grain: Powder Market Remains in Turmoil</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the powder market opened in the morning with extreme disorder across all months. Quotations for foreign wheat ranged from eight to ten points in Chicago and fell by four to ten points in Canada. At the opening, due to the lack of significant fluctuations in foreign wheat and the unconfirmed news from the previous day, market sentiment revived. Buying interest surged across all months, causing prices to jump by three to four points. However, the market suddenly changed drastically at the start of the second session, with large players aggressively liquidating long positions. Rumors of a certain bank's commissioned selling led to widespread panic and exhaustion, causing prices to fall by three to four points from the opening. Subsequently, near-term contracts continued to fall, while distant contracts showed some stabilization. The difference between the opening and closing prices for the current month reached a significant six and a quarter points due to the absence of customer draws. At the opening in the afternoon, the market was initially still poor, but new short positions halted and factory activity lessened, gradually improving sentiment by one to two points from the lowest level. Future fluctuations will continue to depend on news from abroad.</p>

<h3>Active Short Covering in Wheat Futures Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning, prices across all months remained soft. Trading firms were generally cautious, with both buying and selling exhibiting a wait-and-see approach, and no excitement was observed. However, trading became brisk during the afternoon session. The powder market had risen and then fallen in the morning, and rumors in the market favored short positions. After the initial batch of foreign wheat transactions, industry sentiment was not as firm as in the previous month. With the lessons of previous years not far off, operators could not help but be wary. As a result, near-term contracts fell by one dime, and distant contracts fell by three to seven points. Since the sharp decline in powder and wheat futures, the spot wheat market has been rapidly declining for several days. At yesterday's opening, high-quality wheat fell by approximately two dimes. Bengbu Guzhen wheat opened at 4.83 yuan, Mingguang wheat at 4.81 yuan, Xieshi wheat at 4.55 yuan, and Shaoxing wheat at 4.62 yuan, totaling 2,500 bales, purchased by Fuxin.</p>

<h3>Rice Sales Clear, Prices Fall</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, arrivals from various sources totaled over 50 firms (more than 10,000 piculs of goods). Sales in the street market cleared, and wholesalers relaxed their inventory. Only over 3,000 bags were sold, so market conditions weakened. Bo Dao fell by nearly a dime, while Hou Geng and early rice fell by one to two dimes. Du Yang Jian fell slightly, and the yuan price also remained weak.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, continuous strong arrivals from various routes down the river totaled about 65-66 firms. White Geng rice shops in the market remained slow, and wholesalers who were trying to hold up prices made some sales, causing prices to fall slightly by about a dime. Early Bo rice had average retail sales, with prices down slightly. Bo Dao retail sales were weak, with prices down slightly. Bu Jian prices were stable, Yang Jian prices were stable, and medium and lower grades showed further weakness. There were few inquiries for customer Jian rice, and Yuan rice prices were weak, down nearly a dime from the original price. Prices of other goods were also softer than before.</p>
<p>(Customer Xian) Yesterday, foreign rice bin prices remained unchanged, and customer Xian rice remained active, but the number of arrivals was not as high as in previous days. Only the street market single firms inquired, and the North Sea only had river rice arranged for loading. Customer Xian rice remained stagnant, and wholesalers remained watchful and inactive, making it difficult for various Xian rice to recover. Yesterday, prices for high and lower grades of rice fell by three to five points. Daily sales included 1,434 bags of Gan rice, 190 bags of Yong Shao rice, over 1,000 bags of Wen Tai rice, and dozens of bags each of Fu Zhang rice, all purchased by firms in the street market. Based on the current trend, it will be difficult for the market to soar in the short term. Active customer wholesalers are needed for a turnaround.</p>
<h3>Little Change in Soybean Market Sentiment</h3>
<p>— Foreign Firm Sesame Sees Activity Without Sales —</p>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market saw little change. For car soybeans, Changde Factory purchased four cars of Chen Dou from Quanhe at 4.4 yuan. Inland oil mills purchased two cars of Bengbu beans at the original plate price of 3.32 yuan. Fuzhou firms traded over 800 bags of Hankou Zha beans at prices ranging from 3.91 to 3.75 yuan. Transactions of other Du beans and high, fixed, and inferior grades of Sha Huang beans were sluggish. Foreign firm sesame, which previously opened at 11.85 yuan, has seen no sales in the past two days. The spot market for raw sesame has weakened. Yesterday, Yao Wan Suqian's yellow and white sesame opened at 8.2 to 8.2 yuan, with over 1,200 bags sold.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Market Gradually Improves Following Japanese Silk</h3>
<p>The local silk market has become more active due to recent improvements in Yokohama silk prices. Market sentiment is showing signs of strengthening. However, it is said that the rise in Japanese silk prices is due to manufacturers artificially raising prices. Therefore, the forecast for Shanghai silk prices still depends on how well Yokohama wholesalers can maintain their prices.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Slightly Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign firm tea market was slightly quiet. European firms had already completed orders placed through overseas telegrams last week. Recent inquiries received no response, leading to a wait-and-see bearish attitude. Only Jardine Matheson and Yongxinghe Middle Tier firms purchased needle, eyebrow, and Xiu Mei green teas, totaling over one hundred boxes. Market prices remained stable.</p>
<h3>Hardware: 2,000 Loads of Black Iron Sheet Disposed of</h3>
<p>Yesterday, black iron sheet sales reached an estimated 2,200 loads due to purchases by enamelware factories and thermos factories. Prices for grade A goods were 9 yuan per load, while grade B goods were estimated at 8.75 yuan per load. The sales were primarily from hardware stores along North Suzhou Road. However, there is not much circulating stock in the market, so prices will not fall in the short term. Overseas quotations for grade A goods have reached 11 pounds and 10 shillings, and grade B goods have risen to 9 pounds and 15 shillings, an increase of half a pound to one pound from before.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Local Refined White Sugar Opens Lower by a Dime</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trended slightly tighter. The guild priced 24 coarse granulated white spot goods at 21.9 yuan, up another five points. Transshipment was unchanged at 6.8 yuan. There were no transactions. Local factory refined white Zhenji No. 1 was at 20.7 yuan, No. 2 at 4 dimes, No. 3 at 20 yuan, No. 4 at 19.8 yuan, and No. 5 at 6 dimes, down by a dime. Only Chao firms offered several dozen bags of red sugar at 12.8 yuan, with no changes. After discussions between Quanzhou red and white sugar firms, no transactions were made due to large price differences. Dong red sugar was quoted at 17 yuan, No. 8 white sugar at 21.6 yuan for transshipment at 6.65 yuan, and No. 9 white sugar at 21.45 yuan for transshipment at 6.45 yuan. It was heard that transshipment for No. 4 white sugar was low at 6.85 yuan.</p>
<h3>Textiles: Herringbone Fabric Sells Briskly, Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Herringbone fabric, which is specially made for lined overcoats, soared in price yesterday. Wholesale prices for ordinary herringbone fabric have jumped to 3.6 yuan per yard, and second-grade goods are at 2.6-2.7 yuan. There is little inventory left, and the market is very brisk. Currently, custom-made or ready-made herringbone lined overcoats at various Western clothing stores have increased by an average of 1.5 to 2 yuan per garment.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn Children's Weekly</p>
<h3>The Strong Eat the Weak</h3>
<p>— Ning Ziqiang</p>
<p>Children, since the dissemination of Darwin's theory of evolution from England, we have generally recognized "survival of the fittest, the strong eat the weak" as the axiom of natural selection. However, facts tell us that not only do the strong eat the weak, but sometimes the weak eat the strong. Let's first establish a "hypothesis" and then provide some proof!</p>
<p>1.  Hedgehogs Eat Tigers: "The fierce tiger in the deep mountains strikes fear into the hearts of all beasts!" However, the tiger, fond of meat, sometimes "doesn't have time to choose" and will "run into a nail." The hedgehog is the tiger's nemesis. If it encounters a tiger, it will curl up into a ball, allowing the tiger to swallow it whole. But once swallowed, it will unleash its might and slowly chew on the tiger's internal organs.</p>
<p>2.  Ants Trap Mantises: The mantis is many times larger than an ant. Yet, within inches, it is trapped by ants and unable to move, eventually being eaten by the ants.</p>
<p>Children! From these two examples, we learn that relying on intelligence and collective strength are the only strategies for small nations to cope with powerful nations!</p>
<h3>Pei Xingjian's Forgiveness Towards Others</h3>
<p>— Wei Bingxin</p>
<p>Pei Xingjian of the Tang Dynasty was a famous general who understood military strategy and was good at recognizing talent. Although he had always lived among soldiers, he was kind and forgiving and completely lacked the rude habits of military men.</p>
<p>At that time, disturbances broke out in the Great Food Nation (Arab Caliphate), and Emperor Gaozong specially appointed Xingjian as the pacification envoy to survey and resolve the situation. After receiving the order, Xingjian led a troop, traveled tens of thousands of miles, and finally quelled the rebellious party, establishing a remarkable achievement. When he returned in triumph, the king of the Great Food Nation specially selected many pearls and treasures to give him as souvenirs.</p>
<p>Those treasures were all very valuable items. Xingjian brought them back and carefully hid them, never willing to easily show them to others. One day, he hosted a banquet for his subordinate generals and ordered a guard to bring out those treasures and display them in the hall for public appreciation.</p>
<p>Among them was a most valuable agate plate, more than two feet in diameter, with very elegant patterns, which was Xingjian's favorite object. Unexpectedly, while the guard Wang Xiulie was carrying this agate plate up the stairs to the hall, he stumbled due to carelessness, his left foot catching on the hem of his robe, causing him to fall. The agate plate he was holding crashed against the stone steps and shattered into pieces.</p>
<p>Wang Xiulie, having caused this disaster, was naturally terrified. He immediately kowtowed before Xingjian, begging for forgiveness, even breaking the skin on his forehead and causing it to bleed.</p>
<p>If it were another military man, upon seeing a guard destroy his beloved object, he would at least scold him, or even flog him. However, Xingjian was usually kind and forgiving and did not have the habits of ordinary military men. He remained calm and said kindly, "Get up quickly! — The plate is broken, so be it; you didn't break it on purpose, why do you need to do this?"</p>
<h3>Get Up Early</h3>
<p>— Yiqiu</p>
<p>Good baby, get up early, be energetic all year round!</p>
<p>As soon as it's dawn, get up, carry your schoolbag and go to school.</p>
<p>Brother says: Get up early, I'll reward you with a piece of white sugar cake!</p>
<p>Teacher says: Good morning, good morning! I'll give you a bunch of grapes as a reward!</p>
<p>Little baby, laughs heartily, eating grapes and cakes.</p>
<p>Little baby, is overjoyed, singing and dancing.</p>
<p>Singing makes your heart blossom,</p>
<p>Eating fills your belly,</p>
<p>All these rewards,</p>
<p>Are all because you get up early!</p>
<p>Get up early! Get up early! Be healthy and happy!</p>
<p>Get up early! Get up early! Be free from worry and sickness until you're old!</p>
<h3>Steam Engine</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Min'er's home is far from the town, so his family prepares their own food and drink.</p>
<p>Water is essential, but the water from the well is not very clean, and it's also far away, so boiling water is also done by themselves.</p>
<p>One day, a guest came to Min'er's house, so his father told him and his brother to boil water quickly.</p>
<p>Min'er and Cong'er took a kettle, filled it with rainwater, and placed it on a stove that burned all day long. After a while, the water boiled. A burst of steam lifted the kettle lid. So, they each poured a bowl of tea and went to give it to the guest and their father.</p>
<p>"Little brother, do you see anything special?" After they returned to the kitchen, Cong'er pointed to the kettle lid being lifted by the steam and asked Min'er.</p>
<p>"I don't know; please tell me."</p>
<p>"Watt, he was an Englishman. As a child, he was very attentive. Whenever he saw something or experienced something, he always asked himself, 'What is the principle behind this? Why is it done this way?' When he couldn't answer himself, he would ask his parents. One day, he was having lunch with his parents, and water was being boiled on the table. Before long, the water in the kettle was boiling. He saw the steam from the boiling water in the kettle lifting the lid, and he realized that the power of steam was very great. So, he devoted himself to studying year after year, and finally he invented this very important machine. Everyone in the world admires him. The saying 'Where there's a will, there's a way' is certainly true!"</p>
<p>"Brother, so he is the pioneer of the steam engine!"</p>
<p>"He can't be considered the first person. As early as the 2nd and 3rd centuries BC, Egyptians had already invented it, but it was simpler. Later, after the inventions and improvements of seven or eight European and American scientists, the greatest credit still goes to Watt. Even after he improved it, the steam engine didn't stop improving. The steam engine is still improving now."</p>
<p>"What is the structure of the steam engine?"</p>
<p>"The important components of a steam engine are six parts: the boiler, steam chest, steam valve, cylinder, piston, and flywheel. The water in the boiler turns into steam, which goes through the steam pipe to the steam chest. The steam valve controls the steam path and sends it to one end of the cylinder, pushing the piston and rotating the flywheel. When the steam valve is in the old position, steam goes from the left to the cylinder. When the steam valve is on the left, steam goes from the right to the cylinder. The piston moves back and forth, and the flywheel rotates continuously. Trains have this machine installed. We should call it a steam engine."</p>
<h3>Crab</h3>
<p>— Dazhai</p>
<p>Crabs are available in all seasons, so why are so many people eating them in "the ninth month for round crab roe and the tenth month for pointed crab roe"? Because at this time, the crabs are "full of brains and fat intestines," with that rich roe and delicious meat, arousing human saliva. Thus, they are coveted, tempted, and finally plundered and devoured.</p>
<p>From this, we can see that even with beautiful rivers and mountains, if there is no preservation of strength, there is no way to avoid being invaded. Not to mention other things, we only need to look at all of Africa, how all of it has become the territory of the great powers, and the indigenous people cannot be independent. This is a parallel.</p>
<p>The strong eat the weak, the law of natural selection. Crabs live in aquatic regions, do not compete with people, and do no harm to people. However, their meager pincers cannot defend their own safety. "It's hard for an old crab to escape a red back." They turn red, they are sacrificed. Don't blame the strong for being strong, only blame the weak for being weak!</p>
<p>Crabs turn red when cooked, which is very special. Of course, it has to do with the shell, but turtles also have shells. So, why don't turtles turn red when cooked? The reason is that although crabs are bluish-gray in color, they have various pigments such as blue, green, red, brown, and yellow, which are mixed under the skin. Among these pigments, red is the most durable, so after boiling, other pigments fall off, and only the red pigment remains. Shrimp are the same.</p>
<h3>The Meaning of the Word "Mou" (某)</h3>
<p>— Kangjianzhaifu</p>
<p>Probably all students in the third or fourth grade and above of elementary school know the word "mou" (某). And everyone knows how to use the word "mou". For example, "mou ren" (某人, someone), "mou chu" (某處, somewhere), this person "surnamed mou", "named mou". It generally represents an object that is not yet known.</p>
<p>In the era of autocracy, this word "mou" had several special uses. When officials spoke of the emperor's name, they could not read the name as it was, but could only use the word "mou" to replace it. Secondly, for the names of sages, such as Confucius's Kong Qiu, one could only read "Kong Mou", and Mencius's Meng Ke, one could only say "Meng Mou". It is said that this was to show respect, to avoid "offending the imperial majesty" or "desecrating the sacred".</p>
<p>Although the era of autocracy has passed, the word "mou" has become even more active in newspapers recently. Whenever elementary school students see newspapers, they misunderstand that the world now only has England, the United States, Russia, Italy, etc.,</p>

<p>Explanation! Zengzi said, "I take three things to examine myself every day: First, when working for others, is there a place where I have not done my best? Second, in my interactions with friends, am I honest? Third, is there a problem that I have not carefully reviewed what the teacher has taught me?"</p>

<h3>The World's Oldest Writing Tools</h3>
<p>— You Mojun</p>
<p>Writing tools cannot escape paper, pen, and ink. In our country, in addition to the various inks used recently which are not unique to our country, the pen was made by Meng Tian of the Qin Dynasty, and the paper was made by Cai Lun of the Han Dynasty: everyone already knows this, so I won’t say more.</p>
<p>Speaking of paper, pens, and ink, people had already invented them four thousand years before Christ. Egypt is the world's oldest civilized country, and the ancient Egyptians were the most intelligent and creative people in the world. At that time, they made ink like this: mix a little plant gum juice in clear water, then scrape the soot from under the cooking pots and stir it into the gum water, and the ink is made. The pen? The manufacturing method is even simpler. Take a grass stem, sharpen one end, and you can dip it in ink to write.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about papermaking again. This is naturally not as simple as making pens and ink. Egypt has the Nile River, which is the water source for the entire country. A type of reed called Papyrus grows by the river. We now know that the fiber of plants can be used to make paper. However, the Egyptians already knew how to use “Papyrus” to make paper 4000 years BC. The method is to tear the "Papyrus" into thin strips, then press them flat, and then glue the thin strips together one by one. This creates sheets of white paper. The English word for paper is "Papel", which comes from Papyrus.</p>
<p>According to records, Meng Tian was born around 200 BC, and Cai Lun was born around 100 AD, so the invention of paper and pens in our country was really later compared to Egypt. This shows that the ancient Egyptians were the most intelligent and creative people in the world. There is also a hideous, intimidating, and overbearing "Mou Country" (某國), I don't know which country it is.</p>
<p>The troops of this "Mou Country" can arbitrarily conduct exercises and battles within our country, arbitrarily occupy railway stations, arbitrarily force people to sign and seal documents, and arbitrarily open fire and shoot. Aircraft can arbitrarily fly and reconnoiter in our country's airspace. The facts are all in front of us, but our newspapers still have to show respect to avoid "offending the imperial majesty."</p>
<p>Shuowen Jiezi says: "Mou, the ancient character for plum, a sour fruit." This "Mou" character really makes people feel sour when they look at it!</p>
<h3>Types of Water</h3>
<p>— Chu Yu</p>
<p>There are many types of water, and it has the greatest relationship with our bodies. From the perspective of electrolysis, there are distinctions between heavy water and light water, which means that within the elements of water, there are hydrogen isotopes with heavier specific gravity and lighter specific gravity. Ordinary water is a compound of two light hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, while heavy water is a compound of two heavy hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Furthermore, considering the molecules of water, there is a difference between those formed by ordinary molecules, those composed of two molecules, and those composed of three molecules. The most suitable water for our bodies is a simple water with one molecule in addition to the composition of two or three molecules. If it is only one molecule of simple water, it is very (harmful to the body). Water with a single molecule is mostly transformed from water vapor. For example, rainwater falling from the sky is composed of a single molecule, but as it falls, it absorbs various gases and organic matter in the air, so that by the time it reaches the ground, it is almost the same as ordinary water. However, this water is actually not suitable for drinking. The worst type of water is distilled water, because it is water composed of an extremely simple molecule. Because it is too pure, after drinking this water, the osmotic action between the water quality and the cells in the body is too different, often leading to diarrhea. Most of the water we normally use is composed of more than two molecules, such as water from rivers, streams, and ponds. Water composed of three molecules is water that has melted from ice, which is why ice water is very beneficial to our bodies.</p>
<h3>The Story of the White Mountain Crow (13)</h3>
<p>— Xi</p>
<p>I looked up to the sky and cried out: "Is it only I who am not allowed to be happy? Let us leave this place, escape this cruel world. I will still seek my way out in the darkness, even if I am swallowed by some owl, to avoid seeing the happiness of others and causing me pain."</p>
<p>Thinking this, I set off again, flying aimlessly for a long time. When the first rays of dawn broke through, I saw the bell tower of the Saint Mary's Temple. In an instant, I had already flown there. Looking down, I saw that the garden below was ours. I flew down like lightning... Ah, the garden was empty!... I called out to my father and mother in vain... but there was no answering sound. The tree where my father usually perched, my mother's beloved bowl, were all gone. A sharp axe had already destroyed everything; I could no longer see the green lane where I grew up, only more than a hundred bundles of firewood.</p>
<p>(6)</p>
<p>I first searched for my father and mother in the garden, but all this was in vain; they must have taken refuge in some very distant place, and I could no longer get news of them. With a deep sense of melancholy, I went to stay on the ditch where my father had driven me away in the first place. I stayed there day and night, feeling endless sorrow. I could no longer sleep, nor could I eat anything; I seemed about to die of melancholy.</p>
<p>In this way, more than ten days passed in a row, and I just guarded this ditch, eagerly hoping for my parents to return. But knowing that one day after another passed, there was no hope at all. I thought to myself: they may be hiding in some very concealed place and cannot see me. If I raised my voice and uttered my special sound, then it would reach their ears, and after they heard it, they could not help but rush back to see their long-separated son. So I stretched out my neck and called out with all my might, calling out day and night, crying out again and again, "Father! Where are you? Do you still think of your unfortunate son? Mother! You loved me together, come back quickly! Meet me!"</p>
<p>Heaven! Please send a gust of wind to blow my weak voice far away, to blow it into the ears of my father and mother, so that they will immediately fly back and meet me!</p>
<p>Alas, I called out during the day and called out at night, until my throat was hoarse, but my father and mother never came back. How sad! How lonely! Seeing the parents and children in other crow nests reunited, loving each other, how envious I am!</p>
<p>Heaven! I can no longer guard this ditch. I must fly to the ends of the earth, fly to the corners of the world, fly all over the world, to find my father and mother! Goodbye! Friends! I am going! I am leaving from now on! (The End)</p>

<h3>The Gold Disaster in America</h3>
<p>— Wang Yuanfang</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the United States is the world's gold country. According to recent statistics, the total gold reserves of central banks in various countries around the world are approximately US$21.67 billion, of which the United States accounts for 45 percent. This means that the United States now owns almost half of the world's gold. At the same time, since the beginning of September this year, European gold has been constantly flowing to the United States, causing it to increase by several million or tens of millions of dollars of huge gold reserves almost every day. As a result, the total gold owned by the United States has broken through 9.5 billion U.S. dollars. Therefore, some people in financial circles have issued a cry for a "gold disaster." The "Shen Bao" on January 24th once contained the following piece of news: "According to a recent report from the US Treasury Department, the total value of gold reserves in the United States is £1,960,000,000, and even more continues to be shipped in. Since September, the inflow of gold from abroad has amounted to £125,000,000, of which £72,000,000 came from France, £30,000 from the United Kingdom, and £12,000,000 from the Netherlands. The public is not without concern about the continuous inflow of gold, because gold that has no use has now filled the banks, and if large amounts of gold continue to flow in, it is feared that it will help to promote the rise of latent lending and expansion." From this, it can be seen that the so-called cry for a "gold disaster" is not without reason.</p>
<p>In fact, since the devaluation of the US dollar at the end of January last year, the total gold owned by the United States has shown the following increasing trend.</p>
<p>(Unit: Millions of US Dollars)</p>
<p>End of January last year 6,829</p>
<p>End of December last year 8,8,138</p>
<p>End of August this year 9,197</p>
<p>Mid-October this year 9,584</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be seen that from November last year to mid-October this year, the total gold owned by the United States has increased by more than 2 billion US dollars. The sources of these gold are as follows:</p>
<p>(Unit: Millions of US Dollars)</p>
<p>From France 838</p>
<p>From the United Kingdom 747</p>
<p>From the Netherlands 318</p>
<p>From Canada 160</p>
<p>From India 123</p>
<p>From other places 167</p>
<p>Total 2,353</p>
<p>Originally, in the past, European countries still had the return flow of American capital escaping overseas, but recently, most of the gold in Europe has flowed to the United States to seek refuge due to the unrest in the European political situation and the shaking of the gold bloc. As for the inflow of Indian gold to the United States, it has come with the soaring gold prices.</p>
<p>It seems very strange, but the gold that flowed into the United States from the United Kingdom in the past was not the United Kingdom's own gold, but mainly European continental capital that flowed to the United States through the United Kingdom. From January last year to August this year, the movement of gold in the United Kingdom had a surplus of 138 million pounds to the United States, but its overall surplus was 27 million pounds. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Unit: Millions of Pounds)</p>
<p>Inflow from France 96</p>
<p>Inflow from the Netherlands 13</p>
<p>Inflow from India 60</p>
<p>Inflow from South Africa 100</p>
<p>Outflow 62</p>
<p>Surplus from inflow and outflow 207</p>
<p>However, the situation has been different since September this year. A lot of gold from the United Kingdom directly or through France has also flowed into the United States. As a result, in the six weeks from the end of August to October 10, a surplus of 9.8 million pounds was created. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Unit: Millions of Pounds)</p>
<p>Detailed amount of import 19.0</p>
<p>From South Africa 10.0</p>
<p>From India 5.7</p>
<p>From France 0.7</p>
<p>From the Netherlands 1.0</p>
<p>Total amount of export 28.8</p>
<p>To the United States 22.3</p>
<p>To France 1.8</p>
<p>However, because there was more gold inflow in the past, the recent increase in gold outflow from the United Kingdom is not a big deal. At the same time, the outflow of gold from the United Kingdom has gradually decreased in the past two weeks. According to reports, "In the week ending on the 13th, the export of gold from the United Kingdom decreased compared with the previous week, and the import increased. The total export amount was £2,927,000, a decrease of £2,052,000 compared with the previous week, of which £830,000 was shipped to the United States, £358,000 to the Netherlands, £511,000 to Sweden, £213,000 to Germany, and £117,000 to France. The total import amount was £2,875,000, coming from Africa, £1820,000, India £950,000, France £1,126,000, Germany £126,000." In addition, the export of gold from the United Kingdom continued to decrease in the week ending on the 20th. Its total export amount was £1,783,000, a decrease of £1,144,000 compared with the previous week. The total import amount was £11,987,000, and the net import was £1,204,000, an increase of £1,156,000 compared with the previous week. From this, it can be seen that the recent increase in gold exports from the United Kingdom is not as great as the situation since September. However, the gold exported from the United Kingdom still flows into the United States directly or indirectly, so the import of gold in the United States does not stop increasing due to the decrease in exports from the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Among the world's gold flowing into the United States, France is particularly noteworthy. Originally, France's gold reserves accounted for 22 percent of the world's total, second only to the United States. At the same time, when various countries around the world abandoned the gold standard one after another, France still worked hard to maintain it and formed a gold bloc to compete with the US dollar and the pound sterling. However, recently, due to the increasingly sharp struggle between the left and right extremes in the country and the development of economic and political crises, a large amount of cash in France, the world's second largest gold country, has flowed out. The report on November 16th said: "Since the Bank of France issued its weekly report last Wednesday, a large amount of gold has continued to flow out of the country. The bank then raised the discount rate again this month, from 5% to 6%, in order to remedy the situation. It is estimated that since November 14, more than 100,000 francs of domestic gold have flowed out of the country. The government will formally announce this figure on Wednesday. It is expected that the amount of gold and silver currency listed in the Bank of France's weekly report will decrease from 700 million francs to 690 million francs. ... The current level of gold reserves of 690 million francs is similar to the amount of inventory in 1931." Such a large amount of gold, of course, is mostly flowing into the United States. Judging from the current situation, French gold may continue to flow out, so American gold will continue to increase.</p>
<p>However, gold is fluid. If you have a large amount of gold but have no use for it, it will attract disasters. The United States is currently facing the danger of inflation due to the large inflow of gold and the increase in the issuance of silver certificates. The excess reserves of various banks have now reached 3 billion US dollars, and the interest rate still shows an unprecedentedly low level. This is very good for the general industry, but not good for banks that are working hard to improve their profitability. At the same time, the increase in excess reserves poses a risk of currency inflation. A recent bank monthly report in the United States issued such a warning: "The inflow of gold into the United States does not get any lasting benefits, because the capital that flows in rapidly may flow out rapidly in the future. Moreover, gold is now useless and threatening." The report also pointed out that the current reserve of US banks has risen to an extremely high number, so the increase in gold will cause the danger of expansion.</p>
<p>The world is like this. Some countries have dry finances and lack cash, while others have too much gold and are in danger. The "gold disaster" in the United States is a manifestation of the latter, which is a malformed manifestation in the era of capitalist decline.</p>

<h3>Review of "Boat Girl"</h3>
<p>— Chen Shuxun</p>
<p>I remember that in the "May Fourth" era, a group of knowledgeable women actually participated in the "women's liberation movement." At the same time, they loudly shouted anti-feudal slogans such as "equal employment for women," "free marriage for women," and "economic independence for women." From the May Fourth Movement to now, there has been fifteen or sixteen years of history. In this not-short process, to what extent has the liberation of Chinese women reached? According to my personal observation, apart from a few knowledgeable women who have obtained the status of "vase" and , the rest are either still slaves in the family or have embarked on the fate of a boat girl, A-Ling - prostitution.</p>
<p>What is the reason for this? "Boat Girl" hints in its prologue that men and women who are working hard for the women's liberation movement shout slogans that are earth-shattering, and do a lot of publicity, but they (or she) themselves are either demons who play with women or tools to be played with by others, just as the prologue says: Enthusiastic ladies send out beautiful high energies, the slogan of prostitutes is loud and clear, what is the soul after the meeting ,Taiwanese dance ambitions , the author is firmly grasping , At the same time, the ridicule and satire given are also reasonable and should be done. Although the main reason for the failure of the women's liberation movement has not been proposed or hinted at by the playwright.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of the playwright's rich feelings, several scenes are full of emotional atmosphere, and the characters in the play are so enthusiastic and unrestrained. For example, the close attitude and mutual aid spirit between Tie Er and his daughter A-Ling are worthy of praise and admiration. At the same time, after Tie Er discovered that A-Ling had sneaked into his house at night and understood the "mystery" of the past (A-Ling quietly mended his clothes and cooked his meals), the surprise and the shy posture of the young girl A-Ling all showed a kind of unstoppable enthusiasm; although they did not say a word, all the infinite things in their hearts were unsaid, and the power of emotion was greater than a thousand words. When A-Ling shyly ran away, Tie Er's ecstatic action (ecstatic jumping) was especially the point where his emotions swelled to the boiling point. I think this scene is the most exciting, the most tense, the most relaxing, and the most able to grab the audience's heart. These are all the irrigation of the playwright's enthusiasm. However, precisely because the emotions are too rich, if they are allowed to develop wildly, they can distort reason. For example, after A-Ling was forced into prostitution, Tie Er found her in the brothel. The way they were so affectionate was of course very touching. At the same time, it was quite pleasant to be so angry that he madly beat the prostitutes and made trouble in the brothel, but this can only be said to be a personal heroic performance. You must know that those who create sin are not the prostitutes, nor are they the pimps and procuresses who open brothels. It is impossible to eliminate sin and solve problems by merely grieving and venting anger or making a fuss.</p>
<p>In addition, there are one or two minor flaws: First, small boats often have business competition and conflicts when soliciting passengers. This situation is very common whether at the ferry crossing or on the lake where there are many tourists. If we go to Xuanwu Lake, as soon as we arrive at the dam entrance, the voices of people soliciting passengers will be earth-shattering, and they will even grab us. However, the small boats on the lake in "Boat Girl" do not have this phenomenon. Although A-Ling and her father shouted "Go to Yue Fei's tomb," it was such a brief sound, two sounds, which lacked the meaning of life panic. Second, regarding their residence, I think the environment is too beautiful, especially where Tie Er lives. The inside is so "bright and clean," and the outside is surrounded by big trees and small bamboos. If you don't say it is the residence of a weaver, I would mistakenly think it is a "study" of a poet and writer!</p>

<h3>How to Manipulate a Group</h3>
<p>— Xiong Zi</p>
<p>In the cave-dwelling era, there was no society at all, so there was no organization to speak of. Later, as people had more and more opportunities to interact, societies gradually formed in order to protect common interests. In modern times, science has flourished, and human interactions have become more frequent. Whether in politics, business, or private enterprises, organizations need to be well-organized and managed scientifically in order to achieve results and success. Therefore, it can be said that group organization is unique to human beings, whose intelligence surpasses all other creatures. It can also be said that group organization is a symbol of civilization and progress.</p>
<p>The benefits of organization are many. Here are some of the most important ones:</p>
<p>First, the spirit of one person, even a sage, hero, or outstanding individual, is always limited. Complex affairs can never be handled by one person alone, and no single person can possess all knowledge and abilities. Therefore, it is necessary for many people to cooperate and manage together in order to shoulder significant responsibilities.</p>
<p>Second, the conference system is now popular as a substitute for the dictatorial system. It can avoid the prejudice of one person and achieve the effect of collecting wisdom and benefiting from the collective. precise organization facilitates division of labor and enables everyone to use their talents to the fullest. The result of the implementation of scientific management in modern industry is rapid action and increased production. The workers in each department are like machines that are interconnected. The person in charge uses the workers like moving machines. The Ford Motor Company in the United States is a world-famous factory, and its output is extremely astonishing. The reason why it can achieve such results is directly due to the wonderful use of division of labor and cooperation, and indirectly due to the gift of precise organization.</p>
<p>Fourth, having an organization can cultivate a life of discipline. A life of discipline gradually becomes a habit. After an action becomes a habit, many energies can be saved invisibly. A person's energy is limited. Being able to save energies that can be saved and devote them to the advancement of one's career will naturally have much better results.</p>
<p>Fifth, with precise organization and division of labor, it is possible to select people for tasks and enable those with special skills and talents to have the opportunity to develop, so as to avoid the sigh of "a hero with no place to use his talents."</p>
<p>There are two elements of organization: one is "affairs," and the other is "people." To manipulate a group, both "affairs" and "people" must be fully utilized for our benefit. If one is missing, it will inevitably fail.</p>
<p>The following principles should be followed when manipulating affairs:</p>
<p>(1) System - People who act as leaders, because affairs are clustered, if there is no systematic handling, on the one hand, they will inevitably be exhausted from handling trivial affairs, and on the other hand, because they are trapped by trivial branch matters, they will inevitably be hindered from their talents and cannot free themselves.</p>
<p>(2) Utilization - There are two things that can be utilized in handling affairs: 1. Machines should be utilized at any time. There are two benefits: A' saves time, and B, the effect is better than manual labor; 2. Within the possible scope, office workers from each department should be utilized at any time to assign tasks.</p>
<p>Below we will further discuss the method of manipulating affairs:</p>
<p>(1) Analysis of affairs:</p>
<p>A. Classification - Summarize the various complicated affairs into several categories: such as "unfinished affairs," "letters," telegrams," "telephone calls," "visitors," etc.</p>
<p>B. Grading - Divide affairs into grades according to their importance and urgency. For example, taking importance as the standard, there are important, routine, and social letters. Should we distinguish which ones should be returned to the file, which ones should be prepared for examination, and which ones can be drafted by assistants? Which ones should be handled by yourself? Those that take urgency as the standard should of course be handled first, and those that can be postponed should be temporarily postponed to avoid repayment.</p>
<p>(2) Use of machines:</p>
<p>How should affairs be managed? How can management be considered superior? If a person is organized, he must be able to think comprehensively and avoid acting blindly. And when it comes to handling affairs, he can use various machines to help him handle affairs, so as to achieve an orderly effect.</p>
<p>There are many machines that can be used to handle affairs. Here are a few:</p>
<p>(1) Desk - Drawers are divided into "filed files" and "to-do items."</p>
<p>(2) Memorandum - Either use a book or a loose-leaf page, depending on convenience. It is also possible to use a calendar card as a memorandum. If it is applicable, it is also acceptable.</p>
<p>(3) File box - The boxes are divided into columns, marked with identification. When inspecting, take them from the drawer of the column listed in the saddle. It is very convenient.</p>
<p>In addition, such things as a call bell, business card index, blank forms, charts, etc. are all indispensable supplies for handling affairs.</p>
<p>(3) Assignment of people:</p>
<p>Complicated personnel affairs cannot be solely responsible for or handled by one person alone. Robinson was indeed able to maintain his life independently on a deserted island, but after all, that way of life was very primitive. From a modern perspective, this method is extremely rare in practice and extremely uneconomical in principle. Because people's intelligence is different, the things that each person can do must also be different. For example, engineers must be able to produce scientific and artistic drawings, and civil construction workers must be able to build houses according to the drawings made by engineers. Each person's job is different. If you force an engineer to draw drawings and then build houses himself, let alone whether the houses he builds are his expertise, he will waste his time, which is an extremely uneconomical method.</p>
<p>Those who are good at handling things do not necessarily have to "do everything themselves," but must be good at assigning others. Even if you are a hero, your energy is limited. If you do everything yourself and waste too much energy, it will be harmful rather than beneficial. Napoleon was a rare hero, and his energy was also superior to others. He did not give up on small matters, and he took on everything himself. But how long did it take for his energy to gradually decline? In the Battle of Leipzig, one person's strength was insufficient, and the subordinates had not been trained at ordinary times, so they suffered a heavy blow.</p>
<p>Therefore, the way to handle affairs should be like an arm using a hand, like a hand using a finger. If the fingers are used properly, things will succeed.</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>(4) Handling of routine matters:</p>
<p>Every day when you walk into the office, there are many routine tasks waiting for you to handle. You should not only "suit" these routine tasks, but also "be swift."</p>
<p>The first step is to check the "unfinished affairs" recorded in the temporary record and deal with them first.</p>
<p>The second step is to check the tasks listed in the schedule for today and handle them.</p>
<p>The third step is to deal with new events.</p>
<p>When dealing with new events, pay attention to the clarity of the organization. For example, (1) those that must be handled immediately should be classified as urgent. (2) Those that require people to handle them should be classified as commissioned. (3) If they are to be reviewed, they should be listed in the temporary file box, so that they are well-organized and not chaotic in the slightest.</p>

<h3>Methods of Studying Geography and Political Geography</h3>
<p>— Ms. Qing Tang</p>
<p>When we were in primary and secondary school, besides English and arithmetic, the most convenient and rigid subject in our studies was probably geography. The so-called geography textbooks at that time were full of names and locations of mountains, deserts, railways, cities, oceans, rivers, harbors, straits, islands, etc. Geography teachers, of course, only knew how to "hold a book and follow the textbook and map, forcing students to memorize countless place names and their shapes; as for the exams? It goes without saying that they were based on the teacher's teaching and the students' learning, with questions asking how many islands there were in the Pacific Ocean, their names and locations, or how high the Himalayas were, or how long the Andes were. How could such a study of geography not make people feel that geography is a very boring subject?</p>
<p>In fact, the content of geography is not so simple and rigid. Generally speaking, all geographical features and natural phenomena, and their relationship with human life, are the objects of geographical study. Therefore, studying geography is not just about memorizing place names and their locations, or even just memorizing all natural phenomena and geographical features, but rather understanding the reasons behind them and their relationship to human life. For example, to understand how the rainy season in Abyssinia comes about, why day and night are completely opposite in the Western and Eastern Hemispheres, why the North and South Poles have half a year of daylight and half a year of night, and the reasons for solar and lunar eclipses and the rise and fall of tides, one must have knowledge of "astronomy above" and "geography below." Furthermore, in explaining the relationship between the Yellow River and the Yangtze River and past Chinese civilization, and in explaining the role of the Nile River in ancient Egyptian civilization, one must have knowledge of geography, history, and sociology. Moreover, if one only memorizes that the Danube is the second longest river in Europe, passing through eight countries including Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Romania, and flowing into the Black Sea, that is naturally very simple and rigid. But if one wants to understand the conflicts between France, Germany, Italy, Austria-Hungary, and the Little Entente countries, and even England, etc., on the Danube, that becomes very complex and interesting; but besides knowing the geographical features of the Danube, one must also understand political economics and the political situation in the Danube basin. Based on these facts, we believe that geography is indeed a very complex and important subject; studying geography requires not only memory, but also understanding, and the ability to use common sense from various disciplines to understand all geographical features and natural phenomena.</p>
<p>Does this mean that studying geography is more difficult than anything else? However, when we say that studying geography requires common sense from various disciplines, we do not mean that you should conduct a thorough study of all disciplines, but rather that you should acquire a certain degree of general knowledge from various disciplines in order to understand geographical features and natural phenomena. For example, when understanding the phenomenon of half a year of daylight and half a year of night at the North and South Poles, you only need to know the shape of the Earth and its rotation in relation to day and night on Earth, and you don't need to become a dedicated astronomer. In fact, all disciplines are interconnected, and studying any subject requires a considerable amount of knowledge from other disciplines. For example, someone who studies history must have considerable knowledge of sociology, anthropology, geography, political economics, and so on. The same is true for anyone who studies any other discipline.</p>
<p>At the same time, although the Earth exists objectively outside our minds, all geographical features and natural phenomena are directly or indirectly related to our lives. The ability of rivers and oceans to facilitate our transportation, the difficulty of mountains and deserts in allowing us to travel, the hindrance of typhoons and torrential rains to our navigation, and the benefits of natural products from various places to our lives are all clear evidence of the close relationship between geographical features and natural phenomena and human life. We study geography not just to memorize some place names, but mainly to understand the relationship between geography and human life, and thereby use this geographical knowledge to strive to promote the evolution of the relationship between humans and nature, in order to continuously improve our lives. Therefore, in addition to conducting general surveys of geography, we must especially study it from the perspective of the relationship between human life and geography. For the sake of convenience, we will divide this into three aspects—</p>
<p>(1) How to study geographical features? Regarding geographical features, the main thing, of course, is to understand them in relation to the country, the nation, and human society. For example, when studying the situation of the Balkan Peninsula, it is of course necessary to know that it protrudes between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, holding the throat of Asia and Europe, but if we do not study the conflicts between England, Russia, Germany, France, Italy, and Austria there before the war, and do not study the domestic situations of England, France, Italy, and the Little Entente countries after the war, as well as their political and even military relations with this region, then knowing that the Balkans have such geographical features is useless. This is because the current geographical importance of the Balkans is formed under the complex political relations of the European powers, and if the complex and serious political situation of the Balkans is not understood, then its important geographical features cannot be understood. In addition, when studying the situation of the Pacific Ocean, the situation of the Baltic Sea, the situation of the Danube basin..., it is necessary to know the economic, political, and even military relations of certain countries in these places in order to understand why their geographical features are important. The reason has been stated above.</p>
<p>(2) Research on the climate of various places. As humanity has evolved to the present, the cold and heat of the climate can no longer directly and absolutely affect people's lives, and using the cold and heat of the climate to explain the characteristics of various peoples is an exaggerated expression of the effect of nature. However, the fact that the climate can affect the survival of plants and animals, and still has more or less influence on human life, is undeniable. Moreover, even now, the climate in some places is still resisting human power. For example, although the North and South Poles have now been explored by humans, because their climate is too cold, and it is half a year of daylight and half a year of night, it is still not easy for humans to live there, and the abundant products there have not all been developed to help human life. Because of these relationships, when we study the geography and climate of a place, in addition to knowing the climate situation of a certain place and why it has that climate, we should also know what items its climate is suitable for producing, and what relationship it has with the lives of the local people; if the climate of a certain place is too cold or too hot, hindering human life, then we should go further to conquer it. Only by studying the climate of geography in this way can it benefit human life, otherwise, it is of little use to simply know that a certain place is cold, a certain place is cool, and a certain place is warm.</p>
<p>(3) Research on the products of various places. It goes without saying that products have a more direct relationship with human life. Therefore, the study of products in various places should of course be linked to the relationship with human life. However, in the meantime, we should pay special attention to the relationship between the products of various places and various countries, because this can also give us some international knowledge. For example, the oil mines in Abyssinia have become the reason for the struggle between England, Italy, and even the United States for Abyssinia; the struggle between Germany and France for Alsace-Lorraine and the Rhine River is because these places produce abundant coal and iron; if we want to study the products of these places, we must know their international relations.</p>
<p>Studying geography in this way can not only acquire useful geographical knowledge, but also increase general knowledge. Without saying anything else, if you do not study geography according to this method, and do not know the national situation of Italy, the relationship between England and Italy in East Africa and the Mediterranean, and all the circumstances of Abyssinia, then you will still not understand the significance of the Italian-Abyssinian War when you see it in the newspaper. It can be seen from this that studying geography in this way is also beneficial for reading newspapers.</p>
<p>Now, political geography is highly valued. For example, articles about the Mediterranean, the Strait of Gibraltar, the Suez Canal, and the Nile River, which are published in various magazines and newspapers, are all called political geography. Recently, there have been publications of books and maps on political geography. This kind of geography is interesting and not rigid to study, and the results can also obtain a lot of useful knowledge, which is much better than the boring geography of the past. But this kind of political geography is based on the research methods mentioned above.</p>

<h3>Talking About Prostitutes</h3>
<p>— Gui</p>
<p>I have traveled a lot of China's land. Wherever I go, whether it is a big or small city or a town or village, I can see more or less some pale-faced women who are malnourished and sleep-deprived. They are either throwing glances at others or twisting their bodies to flaunt their charm. This cannot be said to be "romantic" or "flirtatious," but rather full of life's anxieties! If these kinds of women are also members of society, then there are too many such people in the current society. This doesn't seem like a good phenomenon!</p>

<h3>Li Liweng's Aphorisms</h3>
<p>— Zhou Leshan</p>
<p>Although I am very poor and humble, I would never dare to do anything that sacrifices integrity for profit: rather drag a long skirt today than climb over the wall to steal tiles back then.</p>
<p>Inkstones are not beautiful or ugly, the one that grinds ink well is good. The reason why Duanxi inkstones are valued is because they can grind ink well; if they only have the name of Duanxi but not the reality of grinding ink, it is like Xishi being a barren woman, and Pan An being a eunuch.</p>
<p>Last year, due to migration, I borrowed two hundred taels of gold from a military man. The cruelty of his dunning was a hundred times worse than a Rakshasa. Half of it has been repaid these days, so it can be said that half of him is human and half is a ghost.</p>
<p>My ears burned last night. Could it be that some hooligans were again slandering me with beautiful women? The reason why I incurred the wrath of the hooligans was because the clowns I portrayed in my humble dramas were so similar to these people that they were later brutally murdered, hence the sadness of a fox or rabbit. As for the beautiful women, I have no virtue or resentment towards them. Why don't they discern the cause and effect and echo them? Is it any wonder that I rarely use their beautiful names in my miscellaneous dramas? Perhaps they are pre-emptively getting angry, planning to be portrayed in the future? In solitude during the journey, I enjoy talking to myself. As the saying goes, "Adding a guest doesn't require killing a chicken," especially since there are no chickens to kill anyway, so it's just adding some sinew and increasing the cup.</p>
<p>After leaving home, I remembered one thing: the wall on the east side is very thin, which is a shortcut for burglars; moreover, the servants are fond of sleeping, so it is difficult to expect them to be watchdogs.</p>
<p>The price of rice in Ganzhou is cheaper than chaff in my Zhejiang. Even now, after moving to Baimen, the price of rice is slightly cheaper than in Zhejiang, but eating here is still more frugal than drinking porridge in Jinling. It makes me think that travelers want to eat their fill and die, while family members want to starve to death. How can the difference between sweetness and bitterness be so uneven?</p>
<p>Nothing is lacking during the journey, even to the point of several people sharing one bed. The coolness is bearable, but the heat is really unbearable. I have to borrow from Chen Fan's house, whether it is bamboo or wood. Fortunately, I can borrow one of them, so there is no need to say that I won't go down unless it's Xu Ru.</p>
<p>Asking people for flowers is an elegant affair for oneself, but not for the other person. However, not asking my old man for purple flowers is inelegant for myself, and not an elegant affair for my old man either.</p>
<p>Yesterday, an old man reported across the river that your department's grapes were ripe and wanted to pick them for me. My family members have been drooling for a whole day and night. Now that they have been delivered, eating them feels even more delicious, because they have been desired for a long time and then obtained, which is different from suddenly encountering them. This is the same as marrying a plum blossom at the beginning and passing the imperial examination with white hair. Thank you.</p>
<p>I have been in Chu for half a year, and I have gained very little money, but I have gained quite a few sentences.</p>
<p>Are there any people in the world who are poorer than Liweng on the lake? Everyone says yes. There are so many poor people in the world that they exceed the sands of the Ganges. They all suffer from a lack of fixed property, little business, and no one to rely on in all directions. Even if there is someone to rely on, it is not much. They lack the gift of a coarse silk robe in the cold and have no one to ask for rice when hungry. This is why they are poor. I do not have the fields that eight mouths should have, but there are five times as many people who are waiting for me to provide for them. Even if there are articles that can be sold, the money from selling articles can be counted on one's fingers. With forty mouths relying on one person for food, it is like one mulberry leaf feeding a hundred baskets of silkworms. They grow day and night, how can it be enough?</p>
<p>West Lake is nothing else but the Song Dynasty's pond for releasing animals; today's so-called pond for releasing animals is only a scoop of water compared to back then.</p>
<p>A slender finger holding a chess piece, hesitating to move, quietly observing this state is enough to be enchanting. If I must win, I'm afraid there is no such villain in the world.</p>
<p>The ancients taught women to sing and dance, not to teach singing and dancing, but to practice their voice and appearance. If you want their voice to be gentle and melodious, you must make them learn to sing. Once they have learned to sing, then every utterance will have the charm of a swallow's song and an oriole's cry. They don't have to sing, but the singing is in it. If you want their posture to be light and graceful, you must make them learn to dance. Once they are skilled in dancing, then every turn and step will be full of the appearance of willows swaying and flowers smiling. They don't have to dance, but the dancing is in it.</p>
<p>These kinds of women have different names depending on the region: in Guangdong, they are called "Lao Ju" (transliteration), in Sichuan they are called "She Wu," in the north they are called "Biao Zi," in northern Huai they are called "Xiang Gong" (this Xiang Gong is not that Xiang Gong), and in Shanghai they are called "Ye Ji." At the same time, they have different categories due to different prices and registries. For example, cheap ones are called "Ban Tiao" in the north, "Che Huo" (transliteration) in Guangdong, "Tu Fei" in northern Huai, and "Shi Peng" in Sichuan; high-priced ones are called "Gu Niang" in the north, "Xiao Jie" in Guangdong, "Pi Pa Zai" in Guangxi, and "Wan Jia" in Sichuan; others include "Shi Bang" and "Guang Bang," which are also distinguished by local characteristics. Shanghai has the most names and grades</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Shanghai has the most names and grades. Besides "Shu Yu" and "Yun Er," there are also "Ye Ji," "Tang Bai," "Xian Shui Mei," "Xian Rou Zhuang," etc.; while in other places, there are only "First-Class Companies" (also known as "Chang San Tang Zi"), "Second-Class Companies," or "Yang Bang" and "Tu Bang."</p>
<p>Chinese prostitutes can be divided into two major branches, namely "Yangzhou Bang" and "Suzhou Bang." Both have a long history and a solid reputation. We can often see records of Yangzhou and Suzhou prostitutes in novels. For example, Shen Sanbai, the author of "Six Records of a Floating Life," mentioned in "Quick Notes of a Rambling Journey" that he had a good relationship with a Yangzhou prostitute in Guangzhou, which shows that Yangzhou prostitutes had become "crusaders" in the south during the Qianlong era. At that time, the sea route to the south was not yet open to wheeled vehicles, and it had to be transferred from Anhui and Jiangxi. The road was so circuitous and dangerous, and there were still traces of "crusaders," so the rest of the north and west were even more conquered by them. As for Suzhou Bang, they also developed outward very early, and their beautiful names are known in all provinces. However, now Yangzhou Bang still has a relatively large territory and a more prosperous business. They have forces in almost all places: such as the Liangguang region in the Pearl River Basin, where there is no Suzhou Bang, but the forces of Yangzhou Bang are very active; even remote provinces such as Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan have their seductive flags, but they are not called Yangzhou Bang here, but "Xiajiang Gu Niang." As for the places through which the Pinghan, Jinpu, and Longhai railways pass, they are almost all controlled by Yangzhou Bang, and there is a general feeling of accumulated Chen goods in the area. In these places, as long as you see a fashionable woman, if you ask her, "Where is this girl from?" she will definitely answer with a smile, "Yangzhou, a small place." If you ask three or five, the answer is the same. As for Suzhou Bang, their territory has shrunk to only three places: Shanghai, Wuhan, and Beiping. At the same time, these places are also divided by Yangzhou Bang and other parties, but although the territory is small, the business is very developed, because these places are all prosperous big cities, and there are many rich men who spend thousands of dollars to buy a smile, so they are not a weak minority compared to Yangzhou Bang.</p>
<p>In fact, there is not much difference between the two factions. As far as people are concerned, they are all complete with five senses, and the places where they grow up are not very far apart. The so-called "water color" is still about the same. At the same time, there are also those who are originally from Suzhou but are listed as Yangzhou Bang, and vice versa. Originally, Yangzhou Bang and Suzhou Bang were not entirely the products of Yangzhou and Suzhou. As far as I know, many of the Yangzhou Bang girls in Henan are from Hubei; Huaibei is only a short distance from Yangzhou, and half of the Yangzhou Bang there are from Zhenjiang and Anhui; even the Suzhou Bang in Shanghai has many Northerners. The reason why they pretend to be brands is nothing more than to develop their business, because the legend that Suzhou and Yangzhou produce beauties has been circulating for a long time. They think that by carrying such a brand, they will also have the demeanor of a beauty, so you carry this brand and I carry this brand, making all the prostitutes in the country Suzhou Bang or Yangzhou Bang.</p>
<p>The fact is exactly like this; with these two brands, it seems that the price will be particularly noble. Leaving aside Suzhou Bang, let's just talk about Yangzhou Bang. The value of the places they go to is always much higher than that of Tu Bang. For example, in Huaibei, the most a general local prostitute can charge for a night is four or five yuan (even as little as eight corners), while the minimum for a Yangzhou Bang is sixteen yuan. On the Pinghan Road, it can be reduced by three or four yuan, while a Tu Tiao only needs one or two yuan! As for Liangguang and Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan, local goods are even more worthless, while Yangzhou Bang must be at least thirty or forty yuan, and also have to go through "calling Tiao Zi," "doing flower head" and various procedures before "falling into a relationship." These also require tens of yuan in expenses, totaling almost one hundred yuan. Compared, there is a world of difference!</p>
<p>However, they cannot become capitalists. One reason is that the expenses are too large. For example, opening a dish head and laying out a market surface will cost a lot. Second, they have very few customers. It is rare to have two customers a month, because in inland cities (Yangzhou Bang runs mostly foreign docks), there are very few who are willing to spend money like dirt, and there are many people engaged in this business, and the competition is fierce, so their business is getting worse and worse. Last year, when I was on the Pinghan Road, I knew that there were several Yangzhou Bang brothels. Because they had very few customers, in order to maintain their expenses, they advertised to railway staff, voluntarily canceling the procedure of doing flower heads and reducing the cost of the night, in order to attract a few more customers, but the result was still a deserted door, with empty hopes. Several even moved their docks, running to Tongguan and Lanzhou, hoping to find another way out in those remote places. There were also two brothels, because the business was bad, the pimps abused the prostitutes as much as possible, and they even ran to the "Jiliang Institute" to ask for relief. There are even more prostitutes in Huaibei. A reporter from Da Gong Bao said a few years ago that it was a "den of prostitutes." As far as I know, there are more than 200 Yangzhou Bang in Haizhou City and Xinpu Town alone. There are dozens or hundreds in Guanyun County (Banpu) and its affiliated Xiangshui Port, Xugou (Lianyungang is here), and Qingpu Town in Ganyu. In short, the total number of Yangzhou Bang prostitutes in Huaibei is about 1,000, not including Tu Bang. No matter whether it is in the countryside or in the city, you can always find many women wearing rouge and red clothes, and they are all Tu Chang. Now that the floods have almost submerged the entire Huaibei, it is not only the Yangzhou Bang who are looking for food and opening new docks, but also the Tu Bang who have to leave their hometown and live a truly "Jianghu life," and perhaps they will have to borrow the brand of Yangzhou Bang! It is a pity that this brand is already old and can no longer attract buyers!</p>

<h3>Raising Relief Funds Ledger (6)</h3>
<p>— Pu Yu</p>
<p>"According to</p>
<p>×× Province Stamp Tax and Liquor Bureau Instruction No. 355: "According to the joint confidential report from liquor merchants ××××× and others: Yuan Tai Distillery in Shuanglong Town, under the jurisdiction of the branch, has been brewing liquor for months without reporting it and secretly selling it locally at reduced prices, hindering the market of the same industry, etc. If it is not false, Yuan Tai Distillery is stealing and evading national taxes and despising tax regulations, which is extremely illegal, and the head of the branch is not without blame for failing to supervise. In addition to sending personnel from this bureau to secretly investigate, it is urgently ordered that the head of the branch truthfully investigate and report within three days of receiving the document to facilitate verification, and cut it off." Because: Upon receiving this, it is urgently ordered that the director, Liu Pi, go to Yuan Tai Distillery on a set date to extract the account books, find out how much liquor the distillery brews daily, how much it sells, and whether the total quantity is consistent with the excise tax certificate used, and truthfully report it to the bureau for verification. If the Yuan Tai Distillery dares to resist and refuse to hand over the accounts, the director should first seal off the mouth of the distillery cellar and consult with the local military police to escort the distillery owner to the bureau..."</p>
<p>I finished reading the imperial decree aloud and showed him the place where the seal was stamped, then carefully locked the Zhu Dan in the leather bag!</p>
<p>But the old thing didn't have much ability. At this time, his eyes were stunned with fright, his whole body was trembling, and his loyal face became a pitiful look. I secretly prepared myself, I shouldn't have gone so far. But for the temptation of money, what can I do?</p>
<p>At this time, in my eyes, he was just like a wounded dog. He didn't have the courage to resist. He was afraid that others would attack him again. But I went further, secretly giving Jiang Xiwu an order; that kid was very smart, and immediately showed his power, putting on a man-eating posture:</p>
<p>"Hey, Boss Li, if you want to save face, take out the account book yourself. I can seal the cellar mouth for you!"</p>
<p>"……!" The old man looked at me with a crying face, his nerves confused.</p>
<p>"Hurry up! Official business is urgent." I put on a stern face and said this sentence, then crossed my right leg over my left leg.</p>
<p>The old man almost shed tears, and after a long daze, he moved half a step at a time to my side, pursed his lips and blurted out a crying voice, "Director, please discuss it again." He looked at my face again: "Our merchant's account book cannot be separated from it for a moment. If it is taken away, then... reputation, faith, business, will all be... that! Even the wine vat cannot be righted. If it really is... then the loss will be great!"</p>
<p>Damn it, he still wants to say it. I knew a long time ago that doing this would scare him half to death. But, I didn't let go immediately, deliberately putting on a strong bear attitude, speaking in a decisive tone:</p>
<p>"No! Official business cannot be negotiated!"</p>
<p>The old man immediately showed a disappointed look, frowning tightly and sighing for a long time. I felt that he was just like a dog bound by others. I was preparing the knife, slowly bleeding, peeling, and cutting meat!</p>
<p>Finally, talking about the "number" was a bloody battle. I wanted to fight for more, but the old man cried and begged to reduce it. His reason—actually, it could be a plea; the distillery lost money, the expenses were too high, and there was no money... What I made up was: the case was serious, and it would not be possible to spend more money. In the end, I said in a half-threatening, half-persuasive tone:</p>
<p>The following continues on page five</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>"You have to understand that this is an order from the provincial bureau. Although our branch can report that there is no theft or corruption, it will still send a committee member to investigate. For the committee member, the reception fee alone will cost more than one hundred yuan, and to prevent him from saying bad things, will it cost a few dollars? You must know that other people who handle official business are definitely not as kind and soft-spoken as I am. Also, those in our bureau who handle paperwork, stay up all night for your affairs, don't they need a few tea money? To be honest, if I, Lao Liu, had bad intentions, I would be cut off from my descendants."</p>
<p>As soon as I finished saying the four words "cut off from my descendants," I felt a chill in my heart, and Jiang Xiwu, that hateful kid, "choked" out a laugh. Damn it, he almost made my face blush! I glared at him fiercely before putting on a peaceful face and saying to the old man:</p>
<p>"Boss Li, I, Liu, am a good friend. I want to help to the end. But, as you know, I don't have the power to give money. In short, four hundred yuan is not much, otherwise, then..." I didn't say the second half of the sentence definitively, just shook my head slightly a couple of times! (To be continued)</p>

<h3>"One Night of Tenderness" Released</h3>
<p>Paramount's "One Night of Tenderness" Hands Acoss The Tabl, starring beauty star Carole Lombard, is a romantic and passionate blockbuster comparable to "It Happened One Night." The film tells the story of a man and a woman, one wanting to marry a wealthy son, and the other wanting to marry a wealthy woman; but taking advantage of their loneliness, they live together, and when the night is quiet, they express their passion. In the end, love triumphs over money, and they both abandon their vanity and become lifelong partners. This film uses a very delicate approach to portray the feelings between men and women, which is quite touching. The film has been released at the Great Light Cinema today. The picture is a scene from "One Night of Tenderness."</p>
<h3>Silver Jottings</h3>
<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>The daughter of "Standard Beauty," Xiao Feng, died of diphtheria. Will "Standard Beauty" have no descendants? (Note: "No descendants" refers to "Standard Beauty" having no descendants, not Xu Lai having no descendants.)</p>
<p>Hu Die's wedding newsreel has been shown in Jincheng before "Boat Girl" in the past few days. The reason why "Boat Girl" had Hu Die's wedding newsreel a few days ago was due to the incomplete review procedures.</p>
<p>It is also rumored that "Boat Girl" was originally scheduled to be shown after Shanghai Company's "Peach Blossom Dream," but it was temporarily moved forward. The "cover advertisement" issue is related to this; in fact, Shen Xiling would never argue about this.</p>
<p>New Era Company's "Mr. Wang Goes to the Countryside" was secretly screened at the Central Grand Theater at 12:00 last night.</p>
<p>It is unknown whether the star's "blockbuster" "Begonia Red" will be starred by Bai Yushuang? It is rumored that the script was personally written by Zhang Shichuan, but this is not true. The script was actually written by Mr. Wang "Superficial".</p>
<p>It is rumored that Miss Liang Baipi, who is related to Ye Qianyu's disappearance, has been very interested in dancing recently and has been seen in various nightclubs. Some say: "After Qianyu, here is another one."</p>
<p>Who exactly is Jiang Jianxia?</p>
<p>When this name appeared in "Modern" and "Literary Pictorial," it was indeed Du Heng's old shop, but in an article signed Jiang Jianxia in the later "Morning Light," it talked about the feud between Du Heng and Mao Dun, so some people suspected it was Ye Lingfeng's pseudonym. Yesterday, "Crossroads" stated that Jiang Jianxia was the pen name of Ye Lingfeng and Mu Shiying, so this "hybrid" should specifically refer to "Wu Jianxia" in "Morning Light" and "Daily Movies".</p>
<h3>"Hero of the Times" to be screened today</h3>
