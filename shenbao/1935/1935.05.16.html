<h3>冤獄賠償運動</h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>全國律師恊會本其救焚拯溺之精神。乘司法長官整綱飭紀之會。積極從事寃獄賠償運動。以期實現國家賠償制度。而使被寃者得有所救濟。此種保障人權之運動。誠最近值得注意之事件也。</p>
<p>司法上搆成寃獄之根本原因。厥為審判之違反正義。夫司法審判者。乃根據正義之要求。以權力之行動。促公平合理之判决之實現者也。故正義為司法裁判之根本。違反正義。而其裁判時有以過失或故意之成分者。卽構成寃獄。我國司法現象之尚未臻於健全。為不必諱言之事實。司法官吏之能廉明守法。審理案件時。以正義為標準者。固不乏人。而其操行學識。發生疑問。問事决獄。不以正義者。亦有所難免。無辜良民。旣蒙不白之寃。或罪輕罰重。因而破家戕身。或憤激嗚寃。造成社會不平之氣。古昔所謂「堂上一筆硃。階下千滴血」之可慘痛現象。於今日之中國。尚不免數見。人權之未獲充分保障。可以知矣。全國律師恊會有鑒及此。起而準備建議政府。對於過失或故意裁判。施行國家賠償責任之制度。並建議立法當局。製定寃獄賠償法。固所宜也。</p>
<p>吾人試縱目以觀國外。則世界之法治國家。不論在公法方面。或私法方面。對於人民因其機關之權力行動而發生之損害。恒予以賠償。舉例以言。若英若美。皆於判例之中。為寃獄賠償之規定法。意則直規定於刑事訴訟法中。而陶爾斐斯執政前之奧大利。與希特勒執政前之德意志。更以特別法律。規定寃獄之賠償。我國現雖尚未臻於完整之法治。但司法院與司法行政部。近來頗有積極整理司法之意。如修正刑訴審限規則。决定在十四省推行三級三審制。定期召集司法會議等等。均有急求實現完整法治之傾向。全國律師恊會之進一步要求確定。寃獄賠償制度以冀人民權益多得一層保障。事之有成。固為國人所亟望也。但更進一步言之。寃獄賠償。僅能救濟於寃獄發生之後。艱以防止寃獄之發生。其救濟為消極的。至於積極之救濟。則在防止寃獄之發生而防止寃獄發生。之方法則在求司法。制度之完善。故我人深望司法當局能允全國律師協會之要求。消極救濟可以實現。並更努力改良司法。以作積極之救濟也</p>

<h3>墨索里尼演說　阿比西尼亞問題　派失東菲預防措置　任何國均無權過問　歐洲方面有備無患</h3>
<p>（羅馬）首相墨索里尼本日在參議院發表關於阿比西尼亞問題之重要演說、堅决否認英法兩國為阿比西尼亞事件、向意國提出交涉之說、墨索里尼謂、「至目前為止、英法兩國絕未提出此種交涉、就英法意三國現在之關係而論、卽在將來、大約亦不至有此交涉、蓋英法意三國間儘可從容大度、相互陳述觀點、而無須出以外交交涉也、」墨索里尼對於一般以意國在東菲窮兵黷武為慮者、則故作諷刺之詞、「今人輒以為歐洲時局不靖、意國軍隊殊不宜出國遠征、為此說者誠屬振振有詞、且絕無私意存於其間、吾人聞之固不勝感激、然吾人敢答之曰、吾意國懷抱、正與此相同、意國遣往東菲之工人、其人數多於兵士、何以故、亦卽欲以謀歐洲之平靖故也、且余敢作明白鄭重之宣言曰、吾人將繼續派遣吾人所認為必要之一切兵士、吾人派遣軍隊赴東菲洲、乃屬一種預防措置、其性質若何、無論何人、均無權加以過問、東菲問題、艱難萬狀、除吾意國外、無論何人、均不能妄加論斷、蓋吾意國在東菲一帶、飽受流血之經騐、始終不能忘懷也、如吾國殖民地之安全、一日未獲保障、意大利母國軍隊及士人兵士、倘有一人生命遭受威脅、則吾人寗願鹵莽從事、而不願姑息苟安、就外交方面而論、則過去種種、已為世人所昭知、吾人幷未拒絕與阿比西尼亞舉行談判、就吾人準備指派仲裁委員會委員二人之一事、卽足以證之、惟阿國方面大舉動員、準備進攻、阿國當局、尤其是阿國部落首領、均反對與意國作一切之妥協、職是之故、使阿國不敢萌生妄念、以圖一逞、則固意國應有之責也、至在歐洲方面萬一不幸禍變猝發、則予敢聲明、吾人保有一九一一年·一九一三年·一九一四年之各級後備兵、而準備入伍之一九一二年級後備兵、省未計算在內、吾人有八十萬至九十萬之現役兵士、當足以保衛吾國安全綽有餘裕、此等壯士、均經受完全訓練、紀律嚴明、至於軍火、均係最新式之設備、數月以來吾國軍用工業以全力工作、亦不虞缺乏、如一旦歐洲有事、吾國陸海空軍已有備無患、然在政治方面、則吾人仍願與歐洲大小遠近各國、作剴切具體之合作、以期實現各國間之穩定與諒解、蓋不然、則現代世界必至繼續趨於崩潰而後已也、要之吾人竭全力以從事軍備、然其目的則僅在保障和平、而不欲威脅任何人」云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）本日意相墨索里尼在參院發表關於阿比西尼亞問題之重要演說後、復由殖民次長萊沙奈發表宣言、略謂「阿比西尼亞附近若干部落人民、遭阿比西尼亞征服後、因實行販賣奴隸、致人口大見减少、歐洲列强坐令阿比西尼亞征服其南方及西方之非阿比西尼亞民族、而不加干涉、實負重大之責任、如長此不已、則與阿比西尼亞毘隣之歐洲各國殖民地、將受恒久之危害、今惟意大利負有保謎遭阿國蹂躪之各民族之責任、蓋已往各種國際條約、均承認意國在東菲洲之歷史的權利也」、萊沙奈又謂、「參議院應作法西斯政府之後盾、在各方面履行其任務、而堅持到底」云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>意指定仲裁委員</h3>
<p>（羅馬）意國根據一九二八年之意阿降約、任命馬勒斯谷悌大使及猛泰那參事為仲裁委員會代表、此舉未足表示此開政界態度較前友善、政界自聞阿比西尼亞再度向國聯中訴後、甚為憤慨、此間報紙咸認何王保證並末下令動員及其最近之聲蝗並無挑　性質、旨在混亂視聽、並稱阿國已釋放攻擊貢達地方意國領事館之被捕諸人云、（十四日國民電）</p>
<h3>阿就人心感不安</h3>
<p>阿比西尼亞京城　此間外僑鑒於對意爭端日趨緊張、人心殊戚不安、多數外僑已將家眷送往古巴蒂、彼等本人亦準備離京、官方認時局十分嚴重、隨時有與意國斷絕外交關係之可能云、（十四日國民電）</p>
<h3>英政府居間調解</h3>
<p>（倫敦）一般人相信英國內閣、現正進行與法意兩國交換意見、謀使意國與阿比西尼亞之衝突、趨於和緩、意國駐英大使格蘭第曾會見外相西門、有所商談、英國方面則力謀意阿混合仲裁委員會儘速開會、以解决阿國邊界華爾華爾之衝突事件、（按去年十二月間、華爾華爾地方意阿軍隊發生衝突、意阿爭端、且由是而愈趨嚴重、）英國或更向阿國政府交涉、勸其取溫和態度、亦屬可能、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美財長宣言　英取保留態度　經濟國家主義濃厚　世界銀價續趨漲風</h3>
<p>（倫敦）美國財長摩根曹關於貨幣政策之宣言發表以後、英國人士多取保留態度、財政部人員、現方加以研究此項宣言在倫敦市塲所發生之影響、可　述如下、（一）摩氏曾經述及國際貨幣穩定問題、故金本位國貨幣一度趨於堅挺、惟金融界人士、始終不信穩定貨幣之談話、係屬適合時宜、因此金幣旋卽回跌（二）一般投機人士、前恐美國宣布今後購銀以國內所產者為限、現摩氏宣言中、再度聲明仍將繼續提高銀價、以改善銀本位國之狀况、故投機家之憂慮業己消釋、而銀價亦為之驟漲、印度中國投機人士紛紛立定地位、不稍猶疑、若干人以為美國白銀政第之目的、或在維持美元價格、使較英鎊為低、俾英國人士無所疑懼、而從事考慮國際貨幣穩定之策云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）垣街批評財長摩甘索昨夜所發之廣播演詞、視為對英而發之請書、亦為挑戰書、謂英鎊現為未知數、摩氏說明美國可安定其幣值、但若世界其他大商務國减低幣值之威脅依然存在、則美國必須始終有再行减低幣值之準備、財部是否現用白銀政策為攻擊英國貨幣當局之工具、此點仍使人不能無疑、摩氏未曾有改變白銀政策之表示、致世界銀價隨之高起、垣街以為因美國政策而起的世界白銀之漲風、終可使英國為難、因白銀與羅比至有關係也、又有人指財長言論為更濃厚的經濟國家主義之宣言、共能否促成國際貨幣安定之恊定、乃一疑問、（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（紐約）財長摩廿索星期一夜廣播演詞中所表示國際安定幣值之姿勢、此間報紙對之、並未有深切印象、許多批評指共關於美國貨幣政策之言論、頗多疏漏之處、如美國購銀政策之理由、未曾言及、卽共一端、紐約時報社論謂政府目前似不維持共一九三三年七月拒絕和解之態度、紐約商報社論謂美國果維持提高關稅、要求償還戰債、及反對對外貸欵之政策、則在英國存金較少之時通貨安定之說、殆未能使人注意也、（十五日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）法國為用全國之領袖、素極主張通貨安定、故對於星期一日美財長摩廿索之言論、完全贊同、法國金融報紙認摩氏之言論、對於金本位各國、有毫無疑義之供獻、並以為如目前擾攘局勢依然存在、則負其責者、當為英國、法國一般金融記者謂美財長之言論中含有詢間英國願否安定通貨之意（十五日路透社電）</p>
<h3>美參議員建議　安定幣值與英合作</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）參議員湯姆士今日在衆院提出一議案、請羅總統向他國建議可否對於世界貨幣安定事維準聯合行動、湯氏稱、宜考慮金銀在一定比例上成為正金之用途、而為若干國通貨之本位、吾人必須先厘定美元、而後始能安定之、吾人未有以為美元現已至應予安定之程度者、他國對其自己貨幣、亦與吾人抱同樣見解、如美國不先再减低幣值、則英國殆可為首先安定幣值為他國倡之唯一國家云、（十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>墨國向美定鑄銀幣</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）財長摩甘索今日聲稱、墨西哥政府己向費城鑄幣局定鑄五角銀幣四千萬枚、聞其所需之銀、由墨西哥政府供給之云、（十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>大批現金由法流美</h3>
<p>（紐約）聞有價值一千五百萬元之黃金、昨準備由巴黎裝往紐約、查上星期預備運出之黃金、聞共為一千三百萬元、（十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>巴西貨幣跌價原因</h3>
<p>巴西京城　據財政部官員向報界宣稱、巴西貨幣「米爾雷斯」機續跌價、性質甚為嚴重、政府不得不立卽設法救濟、巴西貨幣跌價之主要原因、則由於巴西向德國出售大批棉花、抬高貨價、而以德國馬克償付貨欵、然因德國馬克在國際匯兌市縐並無市價、故此項交易、使巴西貨幣受其影響、而致跌價、財政部當局現主張凡輸入國之貨幣、在國際市縐無一定匯兌價者、應禁止以巴西貨物輸出該國云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>國貨前途光明　滇甘人民愛用國貨　聯絡客帮推銷內地</h3>
<p>中央社云、國貨業自經國人提倡後、已日見發展、自承兌匯票實行後、貨欵結解、更見便利、該業商人現已聯絡各客帮、紛向內地推銷、同時財政部亦已決定裁撤轉口稅、以資提倡、故國貨業前途、已有光明之希望、中央社記者爲明瞭該業發展近況起見、特分向該業中人探詢、爰將所得分誌如次、</p>
<p>注意推銷</p>
<p>據專司調查本埠工商業之四行準備庫潘仰堯談、提倡國貨聲浪、暄傳已久、其所以不能立即發展者、原因甚多、而國貨廠家不注意銷路其最著者也、緣該業廠家在昔都竭其全力於貨品之出產、而不注意於貨品出產後之銷路、致銷路停滯、存貨堆積、虧折成本不資、現已覺悟以前之錯誤、對出品加以注意外、並致全力於聯絡各地客帮、俾貨品得以分銷各地、</p>
<p>滇甘樂用</p>
<p>國貨業自承兌匯票實行後、銷路更爲增加、良以承兌匯票有利於廠家與客帮中、最近雲南方面、自國貨展覽會前往展覽後、頗受該地人士之歡迎、第一批運往國貨、如數銷罄、國貨廠商現已在昆明設立國貨公司、積極推銷、西北方面、日前甘肅建設廳長許顯時來滬、曾與本市各國貨廠商商議該省要邑先行設立國貨公司、因該地人士對於購用國貨熱心、甚爲濃厚云、</p>
<p>前途光明</p>
<p>國貨廠商自得悉財政部決定實施裁撤轉口稅後、均表示欣慰、蓋轉口稅裁撤後、國貨之運銷各地、自必更形發展、該業中人並希望政府以後對於外貨進口、該項貨品如與國貨發展有關係者、應加以注意云、</p>
<p>擯除劣性</p>
<p>記者繼又赴國貨界探詢、國人購用國貨、爲當今要務、詎知滬上富家子弟、以及所謂摩登女郎、均以購用外貨爲榮、此種劣根性之謬解、實足以亡國而有餘、故深盼此輩仕女、立即擯除此種謬見、購用國貨、況國貨物品、不特價格低賤、且貨質亦較優於舶來品、鑒於雲南甘肅等省人士之樂用國貨、必當有感於中云、</p>
<h3>春耕運動閉幕　巡逈十七區參加農民共五萬</h3>

<p>新聲社記者昨向工商業探悉、財政部長孔祥熙於民國二十一年及二十二年兩會計年度財政報告總結內各項、如整理關稅稅則、務求稅收增加、而不影響於工業用品、及一般民衆日用品、對於特種出口物產、在可能範圍內、減輕或全免出口稅、以資鼓勵、穩定貨幣、並統一輔幣、以剷除工商業之障碍、改進交通、尤以發展鐵路及公路爲最要、救濟國內根本之農業並謀農村經濟之發展、獎勵並統制國內重要實業、如棉紗棉布生絲等類、各業一致盼望次第施行、均願與政府合作、況上述各項、實爲根本辦法、</p>
<h3>郵儲總局　農業放欵辦法　代理運輸農產物品承受押匯</h3>
<p>中央社云、郵政儲金匯業局、舉辦農業放欵、及農產押匯業務、經縝密計畫、擬定各種章程辦法等、呈准交通部、卽將實行、茲覓得其訂定之放欵要旨、及放欵辦事處簡章、辦理押欵押匯之辦法等原文、並據該局秘書王致敬稱、俟赴各地視察後、卽進行組設辦事處舉辦各項業務云、茲將各情分誌如下、</p>
<p>舉辦緣由</p>
<p>郵政儲匯局舉辦農業放欵等業務之緣由云、本局農業放欵之進行、雖曾於去年與江蘇農民銀行、設一定欵額、爲間接之放欵、直接舉辦上項放欵、尙未計劃及此、查本局儲金大部存戶、均爲五百元以下之儲蓄、而農工與小市民之儲蓄存欵、復佔儲金全額三分之一、以此種來自民間底層之資金、運用於有關國民經濟之農村、頗爲允當、而本局營業範圍、亦經立法院規定、有農業放欵之專條、是農業放欵、就國民經濟立塲言、固不失爲救濟農村衰落之良法、就投資立塲言、農業放欵、亦爲一種實物儲押、與本局儲金運用審愼之旨、亦相符合、故在原則上、投資政策上、舉辦農業放欵、實爲不可或緩之舉、復次、本局以此廣大之組織、與堅強之信用、深入民間、一方利用廣大組織、爲農業放欵之張本、一方憑藉堅強信用、於提倡儲蓄之中、謀當地投資之發展、措施便易事半功倍、故在組織運用上言、本局舉辦農業放欵、亦爲最合經濟效能之業務云、</p>
<p>派員調查</p>
<p>至於舉辦上項放欵、應注意者、扼言之、有三、一、地方經濟交通之形狀、與農產物產銷時期產量銷運等、均應有全般之明瞭、故須事前有細密之調查、以爲進行之準備、二、須有倉庫之設備、爲農業放欵基本之要求、三、須把握農業放欵之核心、放欵應以農產物直接生產者、及與農民有直接關係者爲限、以免爲囤積居奇輾轉圖利者所朦混、此三者、在業務籌備之初、宜加研究、而與農業放欵整個政策上、亦復息息相關、故該局於舉辦之初、決在蘇浙皖三省、先行試　、然後推及全國、並將先派該局秘書王致敬、前往各地、詳爲調查、再行組設辦事處、開始舉辦、而其放欵簡章及辦法、亦規定　嚴、蓋防流弊、致影響　務之進行、</p>
<p>放欵簡章</p>

<p>相當贊成意見　（一）學校放假、教育事業有類休閒階級縮短假期、可免做成休間階級、（二）各級學校、學年可以縮短、但必須改變課程、（三）從鄉村看放假不需要而中國大部是鄉村社會、（四）應注意學生中的高能低能、高能學年可以縮短、低能則有待延長、（三）年中放假日期要分別斟酌農村城市情形、例如南北禾麥收穫時期不同、如規定放假日期多少、决不宜規定時期、（六）兩週放假一日、不如每週放假半天、（七）開夏令班、俾高材生得三年畢業、低材生有時間補習、（八）學生畢業、如年紀太輕、亦似可設法在政府服務一年、或受軍訓、（九）為求普及教育起見、贊成小學縮短年限、（十）此案根據推測、事實上如何、不妨擇一省區、予以試騐、（十）（一）如何善用假期、亦為重大問題、在現假期確有耗費時間之　、</p>
<p>反對提案意見　（一）縮短學年而不計劃新的畢業標準、則所謂縮短學年、不過是快取得文憑、此類提案實無意味、（二）减少假、、教員沒有機會研究、知識必將低降、、（三）如無假期必讀死書、因員生無接觸社會機會也、（四）教育淸苦、全賴放假、有何自由、才有人願意擔任、如生活過於機械、人將視為畏途、（五）無定期休息、在效率上據實際經騐看來、並不見好、（六）教員放假少、就缺少時間做社會事業、如民衆教育之類、（七）如縮短年限、則功課緊迫、不特無充分時間消化、而且有傷身體、（八）一月暑假、招生辦理困難、請教員亦不够時間、（九）學生出路更易、社會更無地收容、（十）縮短學年學生畢業年輕、就業困難、（十）（一）暑假如須設班補習、則年中暑假、一日亦將無之、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （小學生）</p>
<p>下學期的教科書，究竟改用中國紙呢，還是仍用外國報紙印？這一個問題，我想很容易解决的：</p>
<p>只要在板權頁上，印明如左，便可分別，而且於批發上的計算，亦很便利：</p>
<p>照此辦法，假如向批七折的，先把一角折為七分冉加四分，共是一角一分，所加便是中國紙的寶銀，假如原照定價門市賣八折的，所賺不過一分，現在可賣一角二分，仍是賺着一分，每一個小學生，至多不過買十本書，多出了四角錢，然而外溢的利權，可就全部挽回了轉來，任何書籍，均可仿此行之。（小學生）</p>
<h3>飛機塲畔</h3>
<p>— 徐豪吾</p>
<p>職員指揮司役，推開鐵絲網成的排門，幾分鐘後飛機就要下降的消息，强有力地勾住了我的歸心。</p>
<p>整半天所得的觀感：鬈髮時裝的少婦，雜在掛黃袋，撥佛珠的念佛老太叢中，羞澀地摸過了送子娘娘的腳，替它穿上了預製的鞋襪，回頭跪在大殿佛座前，虔誠求籤。</p>
<p>寺裏人擠了那麼一大堆。廟祝嘻着臉，沒命把剛點亮的蠟燭吹熄了，拔下來往染滿了油汚的籮裏塞，燭臺還嫌不够</p>
<p>樂天的男女，玩厭了朝夕與共的都市，乘此春光明媚，携手溜進了鄉村的私人花園。那和煦的薰風，艷麗的花草，陶醉，誘惑了他們柔弱的心。他們說着，謔浪着。雷轟似的笑聲，透過了假山重壘，無情地驚散了柳蔭密語的流驚。</p>
<p>夜吹起了習習凉風，送別了這些「才子佳人」。航機帶着遠方的音信，衝破了塔後薄霧迷茫，斜展着翼，雄威地盤旋在我們頭頂上。白烟起處，江畔水泥廠拉出嗚嗚的回聲，好像代表我們零落的觀衆。對這近代科學怪物，表示最誠懇的歡迎。</p>
<h3>記中國女子書畫展覽會</h3>
<p>— 慧人</p>
<p>中國女子第二屆開展覽會於湖社，參觀者之擁擠，不下於倫敦古宮展覽，其作品之佳者，確較去年更有可驚之進步，不愧為向上之作家。初上樓，卽見楊雪玖之大幅山水，潑墨雄厚。李秋君之山水仕女花影吹笙，設色古雅，頗似玉壺。陳小翠之荔支香近，半江紅樹賣鱸魚，淸逸秀麗，逼近曉樓，而蓮燈退院，鐵笛圖，則又筆致高逸，神似新羅，山鬼夜獵，秋墳鬼唱兩幅，設想尤奇，想小翠素工長吉體詩，故有此奇作乎？顧靑瑤山水幅幅俱佳，不愧為若波女孫。朱志賢之畫鷄，天機活潑。聶其德之麻姑，以八十老人。有此目力，能盡工筆仕女，眞不多覯也。陸小曼學畫於賀天健。所作山水，秀靜無塵，李華書之茶花鸚鵡，逼近宗元。唐冠玉歲寒三友，整秀凝鍊。他如趙含英，毛燧華，吳靑霞，朱人琰，顧飛，鮑亞輝，徐慧，徐冷翠，江亞南，丁筠碧，龐左玉，金秋生，熊氏魯氏姊妹，佳作紛陳，如入玉樹林，數一漏萬，不勝枝舉。書法則馮文鳳，江道樊，巨筆如橡，一洗閨閣織靡之習。然周鍊霞之扇面細摺，小於珍珠，亦覺可喜。</p>
<p>所售書畫特刋，全用利用紙，其毅然提倡國貨之精神，尤為可佩。內載詩詞文字，頗有佳作，昔鄭虔三絕，傳為絕技，而閨閣人材，濟濟如此，且述枝聚秀，集於一堂，亦佳話也。故樂為之記。</p>

<h3>蜜絲佛佗表演記</h3>
<p>— 周文璞</p>
<p>時屆初夏，天氣漸熱，夏令衣着，亟待添製，內子再三速余購買，勞難繼續敷衍，閱報見先施公司正值减價，又舉行蜜絲佗佛有聲電影及時裝表演，乃偕內子驅車往觀焉。</p>
<p>電影塲設於二樓，佔地雖未云廣，而佈置頗稱精美，四周圍以藍幕，幕之內外懸有蜜絲佛佗氏代好萊塢明星化妝之照片多幀，塲內裝設五彩電燈，置有坐椅，富帶藝術色彩，宛如小規模電影院，隨時開映，免費入座，商業利用有聲電影為宣傳，其廣告效力之偉大，不言可喻。</p>
<p>影片係彩色，淸晰可觀，演員均屬好萊塢第一流影星，劇情不外指示觀衆如何使用蜜絲佛佗化妝品之用法，演者在未曾用過之前及已經用過之後，頓時判若兩人，其能改容換膚，增妍添艷之功，一一均能從銀幕上殃入觀衆之眼簾。幕之東端另闢一室，室內滿陳蜜絲佛佗氏各種化妝用品，幷有一西婦為參觀者免費施行美容術，女賓之要求施行者殊衆，鶯鶯燕燕，熱鬧異常。旋借內子赴五樓參觀時裝表演，升降機纔達四樓，掌聲已如雷貫耳。及抵塲，正見李妹妹女士表演晚宴服，男女觀衆伸頸竚望，縐內幾無立足地，後者紛至沓來，勢如潮湧。一幕旣畢，采聲四起，最後無綫電報告游泳衣表演，空氣頓時緊張，寂寂無聲。俄傾四女士魚貫而出，赤足露臂，姿態動人，曲綫畢現，秀色可餐，演者面帶嬌笑，如不勝其羞者，余等置身其間，恍在海水浴塲中也。</p>

<h3>哭謝玉岑</h3>
<p>— 錢小山</p>
<p>嗚呼、伯姊之逝，於今三年，而吾玉岑又死矣。人固有一死，自古聖賢豪傑所不能免，使能盡其用，竟其才，則死亦無恨，若玉岑者，阿可死哉。君祖母錢，吾王姑也，太夫人　、吾外姑也，累世姻親，故知君詳。君早失怙，賴祖母太夫人之教養，得以成立。長游吾父之門，學成，吾父以為可妻也，遂以吾伯姊妻之。君出問世，所交傾天下名士，稍稍得仰事俯畜之資。近者吾姊以娩難亡，君祖母又以去歲歿，君自是鬱結寡歡，病發藥無效，憔悴至死年止三十七耳。太夫人年老，弟妹昏家未了，子女五，幼者始能扶床走，來日方長，誰能遺此。嗚呼玉岑，何可死哉。君治學聰敏自天授，詩文雅麗有逸氣，詞尤工，出入淸眞夢窗間，乃至書畫，亦無不精妙，流傳海外，價重南金矣。嗚呼，天之生才甚難，而又狼藉摧折之，吾不知其何心也。使大假之年，則文采風流，信今傳後，可無疑也。嗚呼玉岑，何可死哉。吾父年老矣，常謂生世一日苦一日，吾母死，吾姊死，讀吾父哀悼文，未嘗不泣下。君視吾父若父，吾視君兄，喜戚相關，原如骨肉，如今淚眼趨庭，無可勸慰，豈惟謝氏之不幸，實為吾家之不幸也。曰，吾欲師事君，君謙讓不敢居，風雨之夕，相從海上，接君緒論，大啓蓬心，偶有所作，必求潤色，君則翦其荊棘，頒之琬琰。自今以後，胸懷苦惡，誰可告語，學問疑難，誰與考質。嗚呼玉岑，何可死哉。萬不可死而竟死矣。雖然，吾固疑君之病也，共故有三。君體弱，藥多于飯，而勇于自用，居海上，近市，烟塵積几，偶有徵疾，飲食不稱意，而君於此時，好學勝于往日，往往把卷竟日夕，面發赤，不顧也，此不壽之故一也。吾姊死後，君追憶良苦，塡詞號孤鸞，往者，君告人日，吾欲報外舅，惟有續書，吾欲報吾妻，誰有不娶。喝呼世之偽　，生時固無不相愛也。及夫歲月迭更，景象漸遠，能如曾參之不再娶，有幾人哉。嗟我玉岑，始終以情，憂能傷人，以至于此，不壽之故二也。君為人謀忠，或乞其文字，無不過望，客至無虛日，雖有疾，必强起縱談，倦乃已，客亦不遽去也。病甚返里，乃謝客，死之前夕，猶為至友深思撰稿，若忘其疾病之在身，此皆足以耗傷其元氣，不壽之故三也。嗚呼，好學也，深于情也，竭忠而為人謀也，有一於此，足以召疾，君乃以一身兼之，其能久乎。吾今年亦三十歲矣，中年傷于哀樂，而學問無所得，憔悴之身，乃獨與君相若，使吾即死，豈能如君感人之深，使平生故舊，聞其惡耗，覩其遺墨，想其為人，而為之同聲一哭乎，然則玉岑可以死矣，吾亦不復為之哀矣。</p>
<p>鵑按；予識玉岑垂五載，慕其才，重其為人，交甚篤。比聞其歿，如驟被電擊，為木然者久之。欲哭以文，苦不能措一詞，茲得錢君文，情眞語摯，深得我心，可以塞吾悲矣。</p>
<h3>哭謝處士玉岑</h3>
<p>— （方子川）</p>
<p>人生若朝露，修短委埃塵，嗟君積顇士，飽學性情眞，憶自旅滬瀆，切磋共夕晨，懷才不偶世，跼躋寄此身，但作事畜想，不慕仕宦情，翰墨香猶在，（君近為我書聯筆力猶勁健）黃壚跡尚新，鸞鶴翔汗漫，夢寐疑夙因，去歲初湯月，疾發來問津，別後感寥落，尊酒何處尋，問天天不語，還坐有餘辛。</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十三回　作嫁固難賣身憐商品為奴亦樂破產說農家</p>
<p>於是斟了一杯茶慢慢的呷着，由他慢慢的伸手去拿茶壺，又慢慢取過一隻茶杯放到面前，水斟到杯子裏隆隆作響，許久不竹斟滿一杯，這時間也就躭擱得不少了。月英呆呆的站在那桌子角邊，那究竟算一回什麽事所以他在大家都不理會他的時候，也就只好順了身子過來，在對面一張椅子上坐下。這張椅子，正是對了王北海的。他覺得這可是有些不便所以立刻掉轉身來，向房門口坐着。也不知道是北海故意如此呢，也不知是適逢其會，北海就在這時，連連的咳嗽了兩聲。月英立刻想着，必是自己轉身轉得太快了，人家說是樣子不對，有些不高興了。於是又二次扭轉頭來向北海看了一下。本來在他第一次扭回頭來的時候，北海就覺得這形跡太顯明了，令人很難為情。現在他在坐下之後，又向人看着，尤其表現出來，他這是有意的。北海虹着臉看了志前一下。志前這才恍然大悟，他們是在相有意，還不屬於那一方面在北海這種刻苦讀書的日子，他實在不該注意到女人身上去。尤其是朱月英這樣的女子，他不是人，他是祖母和母親的商品，誰要得、這種商品，護就要出那相當的貸價。北海不是那些老爺，可以有錢買人的。在這最初的一念，應當給他打斷了回去。（二〇五）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>第三个口令，又從那太監的嘴裏高喊出來：</p>
<p>「直立！」這就是要它們效着那海龍方才所做的樣子，把身子直立起來，用它們的臀部做重心點，像人在席地而坐時的神氣一般；而它們那一條紅舌，却還在仲伸縮縮地吐弄着。當然，這些狗也並不是個個都能很迅捷優美地站直的，有好幾條訓練未久的小狗，還得讓那管狗的太監去督促它們，帮扶它們，使它們也能和其餘的狗立得一樣整齊；及至所有的狗全站直了，那太監方始再喊出最後的一个口令來：</p>
<p>「給老佛爺拜拜！」這个口令的功效可眞不是我所敢預料的了！那些狗竟同時亂呌起來，並把它們的兩條前腿合攏在一起，上上下下地搖着，像是在給太后作揖的樣子：這一幕委實是非常的精采，我後來竟不曾在別處見過有教得如此馴伏的狗。然而這樣一來，却使我對於那海龍所受的特殊的寵過大大地懷疑了：它此刻除掉能和其餘的狗一般動作之外，已無別的機巧可以表顯了，為什麼太后偏是獨獨的寵愛它呢？這倒又是一件令人極難索解的怪事！或者可以說是因它頸上有許多金鈴拴着，能時時發聲的緣故，所以能使太后特別的注意它；但也算不得是一个充分的理由。依我看來它倒是宮中的一个丑角，每能很不費力的逗出太后的笑來（三一五）</p>

<h3>國貨的生機</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>最近吾對於國貨的感想有三點：</p>
<p>一，是國貨工廠的覺悟大家知這在這種狀態之下。惟有同業合作。纔可以生存，纔能够立足。以故各工廠目前的趨勢（一）是同業的團結。（二）是內容的充實。（三）是全力注意於推銷。（四）竭力求出品的改進和成本的减低。這是國貨界的好氣象，恐怕不經過這次困苦，不會做到這個地步。語有之：「艱難困苦，至汝於成」倒一些不錯的。</p>
<p>二，是提倡國貨的眞工夫天氣熱了。夏令品上市了，最近有一家公司。用的一具外國風扇。人家都注意他。店主不好意思，終究是換上了一具華生風扇。普通館子的堂倌，拿起酒來，不是上海啤酒，便是中國啤酒。在他們粗淺的腦子裏，只想拿小銅錢。那裏想得到。是國貨非國貨，可是有知識有血性的朋友，都要喝着醴泉釀造的烟台啤酒，纔是安心。這是提倡國貨的眞工夫。</p>
<p>三，是救濟國貨的基本對策最近市商會根據胡西園氏的提議，請求財政部重行變更稅則，凡已有國貨可以替代的外貨，逐一加重進口稅，使他們的售價，不致减到國貨售價以下。這是救濟國貨的根本對策。值得研究，值得促成。希望政府毅然實行，如果成為事實，那麼，比較放欵救濟效力十倍。</p>
<h3>實業部開國展會之盛況</h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>實業部國貨陳列館，此次舉辦之春季國貨展覽會，會期自本月一日起，至二十日止，籌成曾偕滬上廠商代表沈志成等百餘人，前往參加，爰將聞見所及，紀述如下：</p>
<p>會塲在首都淮淸橋東首，前淸織造衙門之舊址，甚為寬大，門前之建康路，又新近放寬，故游客雖多，不致擁擠，沿建康路分三門出入，門口均搭有高聳雲霄之五彩牌坊，而貼有「服用國貨，就是救國家救自己，」與「多買一件國貨，便為國家多留一分元氣」等標語，開幕時，實業部技監張軼歐主席，謂提倡國貨四字，雖係舊題目，老文章，似早聽慣，而不以為意，其實不欲救國救民則已，否則非身體力行不可。並將金貴銀賤，與銀貴金賤之利害，詳細說明，謂茍不杜塞漏巵，無論如何，必致變為貧血症而不治，語重心長，洞切時幣。上海國貨工廠聯合會陸星莊馬濟生演說時，陸鑒於各業中有粗製濫造，作無謂之競賣，致同歸於盡者，請政府設法統制，以絕其害，馬主公務員以身作則，提倡國貨，則風行草偃，事半功倍，請政府特別注意。張君答謝時，對於以上兩點，均願接受，設法實施，禮堂上貼有最近數年來菸酒進口，洋麥進口，重要農產品進口，各國化妝品進口等統計表八幅外，幷懸中華國貨產銷合作恊會所製之全國中國國貨公司分布圖一幅，分已開辦，籌備中，擬設中三種，指定地點，繪有記號，以江蘇一省擬設最多，計有上海，南京，鈸江，松江，蘇州，無錫，常州，通州，揚州，徐州，銅山等處，陳列室在禮堂之右，全國各省市均有樣品送來，此次徵得者，共六千五百二十三件，教育品最多，計一千六百九十四件，其他分染織工業，飲食藝術，鑛產，醫藥，製造工藝，化學工業，服裝，農林等八部，分門別類，藏於玻璃櫥內，任人參觀，臨時售品所，計有一百二十四家，在禮堂之左，特搭蘆蓆，京杭湘粵平閩魯各處俱來，上海前往者有八十四家之多，舖位皆望衡對宇，佈置均鈎心鬬角，而以冠生園食品公司所設之一二八戰場廣告最為觸目，繪閘北風景，有持槍之兵士作衝鋒狀，向前猛進，內裝活動機關，維妙維肖，上有飛幾十餘，以綫下垂，開以幾關，能隨風翔翔，一軍官左手持望遠鏡，右手指示敵方，亦能活動，廣告中含有救國思想，足以發人猛省，可稱匠心獨運，林主席與汪院長，先後前往參觀，頗為贊許，幷各購貨物多種，以資提倡。</p>
<h3>學校書本的改紙消息</h3>
<p>— 栩園</p>
<p>學生國貨年前經宣誓服用國貨。實為一大運動。現在各校均已從服裝着手。采用國貨以製校服。每一小學生納繳校服費二三元不等。布廠營業因之一振。惟於讀物改用中國紙問題。尚在聯合會調查之中。因有學生團體函詢該會何種教科書有中國紙印者。該會殊無以答。爰由天虛我生以個人名義。致函於商務、中華、世界、大東、四大書局。對於當局頗有一種貢獻。其原函云。「昨有小學生投稿於申報春秋點滴中云。「下學期讀本究竟改用中國紙呢。還是仍用外國紙。這一個問題。我想很容易解决。只要在板權頁上註明。卽可分別。而於批發上計算。亦很便利。其式如左。</p>
<p>小學國語第幾冊</p>
<p>報紙中紙印定價一角外加四分</p>
<p>照此辦法。如原批六折計陸分。學校售七分。賺一分。今於定價之外。加四分。無扣售一角一分。仍賺一分。每一小學生至多不過購十冊。不過增加負擔四角。而外溢利權。可以全部挽回。任何書籍皆可依此比例行之。」此稿尚未登出。實係由栩代表孫兒克言所投。前在機聯會刋一一六期中首篇亦曾刋有「見童年與國貨運動」一文。其中算式。係在加價之中。亦含折扣。惟現在報紙廉過於前。假定以每令二元陸角。計三十二開三十六頁。每冊紙本不滿五釐。如用速史毛邊。六開每頁七釐。計三十六頁。每冊紙本核二分五釐。相差亦祇二分。則加四分之價。雖印訂費工·亦儘可以無礙。但在普通心理。震驚於紙價相差之遠。認為無可挽回。而其實人心趨向。殆無異於漢永。決之東方則東流。決之西方則西流。教科書不比閒書。各有版權。而且先入者王。在此過渡時期。似有關於出入甚大。為此不揣冒昧。擬請於印刷下學期用書之際。搭印中紙若干。庶愛國者不致有錢無買處也。若以洋紙可賒。中紙需現。則采產鉗合作方式。使用承兌匯票。亦可兩得其便。敞廠出紙雖不啻滄海一粟。但亦可助一簣之功。行遠自卑。登高自邇。竊願足下高瞻遠矚。一施旋乾轉坤之手腕。則挽回外溢利權。救濟國內工商。直一反掌耳。幸勿以其多口為憎。倘有某種顧慮。不恥下間。請以電話約時趨談二不勝企盼之至。」幷附機聯會刊一一六期一冊。所用之紙係利用廠之信貢。31×43每令七元半。每頁核四釐七。如三十六頁核一分七釐。此用報紙。加一分二釐等語。由此觀之。似有實現之可能。每一造紙機。至少可以供給三十部印機用紙。如果四大書局一致采用。則華商紙廠前途。大可發展。而內地造紙原料。亦有大量出路。洵一舉而數善備也。</p>
<h3>愛血與愛國貨</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>家庭裏的孩子，偶一不愼，跌傷了手足，或剏碎了頭顱，血汨汨的在流個不北！做爸爸媽媽的，應見了非常痛心的疼愛！急忙取止血藥，和紗布，替他包紮好！血！是人身之寶！本報春秋欄裏，花玲君寫的一篇「血」的短文，說得很對，他說：「若是血與金錢，二位一體論，是可以成立的，那麼我們愛血，便該愛金錢，愛金錢，也便該愛血！用洋貨，把金錢流出去，便是流着我們的血！這種血留着，是可以使國家富强的，所以在這裏，我祝福着大家把一切血，寶貴些兒，莫讓它輕輕地流掉。」</p>
<p>同胞們！愛謎國貨，便是愛護自己的血！那麽，要保持自己生命聯繫的血，用國貨，拒舶來，應該格外要努力了！</p>
<h3>國產學生用品展覽會一瞥</h3>
<p>— 耘飱</p>
<p>學年國貨年！荏苒光陰，忽忽蹉跎了四個足月，就是一年的三分之一；推行的效果怎樣？我們不敢離開現實隨便恭維，全市學生舉行宣誓典禮時，雖曾有一次的國產學生用品展覽，可是時間匆促，對全市學生認識是偏枯的，不普及的；最近學生國貨年推行聯合會請領袖，特在江灣同濟職中，舉辦一個國產學生用品展覽會臨時商縐，這是值得注意的，我因為它是從教育界本身做起，開幕第一天，（卽五月三日）就趨車觀光，會塲在同濟職中禮堂，是國立勞働大學舊址，所以雖是所中等學校，那座禮堂，却彀富麗矞皇的了；面積也很寬廣，門前的裝淡，頗具教育化的藝術，舉目一顧，立刻憧憬到學校的懇親會紀念會這一頓的粉飾了，學生用品展覽而假座學校禮堂，是可收事半功倍之效的；裏面是層層相聯的國圈子，圈子的周遭，就是參加廠商駐足之所；有女童子軍，保衛團，警察，維護塲地秩序，設售品部的廠商有十餘家，就學生購買立縐說，當然先同情文具用品，運動器其，次要的棉織物紗織物衣衫布疋的品類，至於化裝品，並不必需，只給學生們一個印象罷了；見童玩具，陳列的不多，星棋羅布，倒是係藥品，我們做人固然難免於「采薪」的纏擾，畢竟用不着這許多，徒佔塲地幅圓；有兩件家庭用具，倒也值得陳設，留給女學生們當主婦時一個影子；如經濟油爐，不打氣，不用火酒，除了煮飯炒菜，還可以兼做熨斗；幾家廠商的肥皂，品質也不壞。</p>
<p>聽說縐內一切設計，為同濟新民兩校師生合作的結晶，這是值得安慰的一個「知行合一」的表現；我們更希望國內類似的展覽會，多徵求些職業學校，農業學校，學生自己的出品，這次展覽，只見到立達學園農塲的幾件出品，未免鳳毛麟角了；就我觀光的一剎那，雖然如潮湧般擁擠，可是只見些小學生，列着隊伍依次兜上個圈子，似乎對他們認識太尠茫了，應改革這種「牽羊驅牛式」的參觀纔是；同時四大學中學當局們，要負起責任，督促學生赴會賞鑒，因為他們是有自主力的購買者，不比小學生只留印象而已；最後介紹它們的六則口號，（一）我們學生是服用國貨的先鋒！（二）我們要勸導全社會服用國貨！（三）我們要提倡國貨的製造！（四）我們要提倡國貨的推銷！（五）服用國貨培養國力！（六）服用國貨是解决全民生活問題！</p>
<h3>學生的衣飾問題</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>有一位朋友他像打趣般的說道：「一個內地的學生，初到都市裏來，總是穿着土布的大褂，杜做的鞋子。幾個月以後，長大褂雖猶是長大褂，而原料却不對了，不是嗶嘰，便是華達呢：而且腳上也登了一雙皮靴了。再幾個月以後，全身變化，中國裝變做西洋裝了。他們為的要時髦美觀，所以變了再變。誰知道這般一變，洋商笑迷迷國貨商大倒其霉。」還有一位朋友却大發牢騷道：「要都市中的女學生多買幾本參考書，眞像要她們性命一般的難過。不過她們做甚麽時裝，買甚麽化妝品，總揀價貴的外國貨買，眞不知道她們具着何種心理？」</p>
<p>上面這二個人的談話，雖然覺得太過火了，可是也不盡無據。照我想「愛美」是人類的天性，尤其是在少年時代。不過因為要美觀而把國本都忘掉，這是大不應該的事，在這一點上我却有兩點意見在下面：</p>
<p>一是急進的，便是全國學生軍隊化，一律穿着國貨的校服，否則不准入校。女子提倡「健康美」，塗脂抹粉的女學生，一概不收。這辦法雖覺迅速，可是操之太急，或許使靑年人不大贊成。</p>
<p>二是緩進的，便是你西裝也好，中裝也好，原料須用中國貨。你塗粉也好，抹脂也好，最好不買外國貨。這一點恐怕是人人贊成的，不過他們是否絕對遵守，那又是一個值得討論的問題。</p>
<p>諸位學生們！愛國是良心問題，也是絕對自願而不用强迫的一件事。我希望上邊所說的兩個問題，都不實行，大家一致起來自己提倡為是。</p>

<h3>小品文的文體</h3>
<p>— 欽文</p>
<p>一般的小說，為着具象性」，作者大概不直接發議論，在文體上是「單記」的：有了議論的話，總是間接表現：借着「人物」的嘴巴說出，寫成書信，或者編為日記。小品文不必這樣，有了議論，儘可以直捷痛快的表達。</p>
<p>可是小品文，同一般的議論文也兩樣。普通的議論文，關於事實的序述不得過多，只能占篇幅的小部分；小品文可以隨意，如果是速寫的性質的，不妨從頭到尾的整篇是記序，還可以用純粹描寫的「白描」。</p>
<p>這樣「議論」「記序」得以並列，處處都可隨意運用，作者很自由，好象是古文中的雜說」。雜說是「夾序夾議」的，大別可以分為三種：第一種是序述一段議論一段的，如蘇軾的「日喻」：第二種是把事實整個的序述以后再加上議論的，如韓愈的「圬者王承福傳」和吳敏樹的「說釣」；第三種是首先發一段議論的，如柳宗元的「三戒」。其中无論那一種，比較起來，總是記序多於議論的：小品文也這樣。只是雜說中很少是純粹記序的，小品文却別有「速寫的一種方式，是同中的異點了。</p>
<p>小說尚單記，注重描寫，作者的用意只於暗中表示。因為篇幅不受限制，可以多方的刻畫，所以不妨「暗示」；還要故意不明說，只是暗示，才能够滿足讀者的「創見欲」。小品文的篇幅有限，如果也象小說的尚單記而暗示，恐怕表不透達，讀者弄不淸楚，難免莫名其妙。</p>
<p>正因為明白表示，直捷痛快，容易領會，所以讀者，對於小品文總此小說來得歡迎。——小品文的俊點，於簡單明瞭以外，就在於痛痛快快這一點。自然，要寫得適當，才可以達到這地步。</p>
<p>其實新近的小說，為着容易普徧而激勵讀者，也得把事理解釋淸楚，交代明，白。只是要以所寫的人物為主體，於无形中在記序上加以種種說明，很不容易做到。象雜說的夾序夾議，這才省力，也容易收到效果。那末，目前小品文的盛行，固然可喜，也是當然的了！</p>

<p>連日春雨，連日春愁，那濛濛如烟的小雨裏，透過來渡涉重洋沾染着南國春色的愁緒。這種悉緒正似枝籬上的黃色的迎春花，鬱悶地在春雨裏垂領着一般。</p>
<p>撑着油紙傘，從陋巷裏溜過，陋巷被細雨籠住，宛似溶於乳汁般的柔濕，陋巷的頂頭，那露着幽曙的陰影的咖啡館，奏着不入調的小曲，而飾在鬥口的紅色的紙櫻花，正似這裏把夜當日的女人一般，褪了靑春的徘紅的顏色。</p>
<p>看到了這褪色的櫻花，讓我懷戀起正被春雨洗着的植物園裏的櫻樹，在滿了蝌蚪的池傍，脊負着逼在上面的老樹和丘崗的影子，而寂寞地看着映在水裏的自己底姿態，那麽盈盈地開着的櫻花呵。</p>
<p>為戀念這櫻花還不曾被風雨摧殘得褪了色，我擎着油紙傘，似泳於醇香的酒般底空間，到植物園去。</p>
<p>映進眼裏來的。是眩目的新綠色，無論地上的堇，蒲公英葉，雜草，無論亭立在空聞的楊柳，山茶，喜馬拉雅柏，無論植在丘岡上的叢叢底冬靑，都含着最瞬間的生命之活力，衝破了土層，衝破了雨網，顯示着無限的發展底偉力。</p>
<p>櫻花就徘紅地綴在新綠的中間—自然常給畫出一幅合調的圖畫，這宛如一儸似金剛的盡工，不但配合了魅人的色索，還給以成長的動能。雖然在一抹的櫻林裏，沒有些些的徵香，可是那種淸挹的情緒，賜與人間以甚於香艷的感情，本來對於一個孤單的年靑人，最大的魅力，與其說是濃郁，母寗說是素樸，因為這疋是相調和的偕調呵。</p>
<p>登上了徵高的丘岡，就能望見全市的烟突之烟，被雨給壓押着，絲似的，綿似的，橫爬在人家的屋簷工。在植物園裏的環境，是溶於平和冷靜的液質裏，那牆外的一帶陋巷，正惱着屋頃滲透下無情的雨滴吧</p>
<p>我回想，在我現在立的地方，二三百年的，不是以最大的武力，統制着三島的德用將軍的御殿嗎？然而時過境遷，現在這園裏，雖還能看到作為遺跡的肉桂樹，和各種當時藥圃裏的名草，但當時赫赫一世的將軍底子孫，不也在哨着煩惱的日子，離了這御殿，夢迴於過去的榮華，讓白髮侵蝕靑春嗎！我不能感到哀傷，我祈悟於時代的偉力，雖然，我還多少地傷心霜橫於今日天下的另一種人們。</p>
<p>丘岡的後身，是一片茸綠的靑草，滋盈地舒展在徵溫的泥土上；這片草地上建有許多圍着紅白條的幕布底小屋，那裏漂起薰醇的酒味，和忘了世故的醉話。有年靑的，老的，還有孩子坐在小屋裏，都用手拍着音節，歌着俚歌和昔頭，酒像開水一般的灌進胃裏；這種醉了的瘋狂似的豪態，雖然令人想古代唐朝的踏靑時的追懷來，但我却從他們的懽欣裏感到悲傷。</p>
<p>這種享樂的原因，與其說是愛賞滿開的櫻花，傾胸懊於夫庭，到不是說，借着酒來麻醉苦痛吧！他們借着酒，撇些酒瘋，把現實的惡魔，忘得乾乾净净，縱然酒傾了觴，滿目的櫻色襲進了月，整年的苦惱作了一時離別，然而待酒醒後，你們將感到如何的滋味哩！瑣猥的夢於一時的行樂之人們呵，你們將永遠當了世間的牛馬差使哩。</p>
<p>我悲哀地把眼睛移到小池上，我雖然悲哀着他人的苦痛，同時我覺得我就陷在相同的命運上；一陣風吹過來細雨，袖上沾了雨滴，我疑心是淚濡了袖衿；這時，小池起了悠悠的綺漣，綏緩地擴大起來，一羽鴉子正伸着頸在水裏，遇到了徵風，身上落下了若千片的櫻瓣，吃驚似地，游了二步，落在身上的瓣櫻，都飄飄地墜在水面上，鴨用黃厚的嘴呑啄着。</p>
<p>櫻花，常帶些可憐的閑愁來給我，今年在櫻花時節裏，看到了這些忘了世故的醉漢，去年我曾在靖國神社的八重櫻下，看到了可憐的馬戲班的姑娘</p>
<p>也是在四月天裏，在宮城後的九段上的靖國神社，舉行了軍國的大祭，烟花穿破了夜幕，寗火燃破了黑暗，人波似潮般的湃向着正殿前，跪拜戰死了的軍人之靈。在神社前的大廣塲兩傍，搭了許多臨時的游藝塲，我溜過了殘廢軍人坐的幕帳，到了社前的廣塲來。一切雜亂的聲音，雖蒙住了我的神經，但那菜色的殘廢軍人的姿影，却永逐不出在我的記憶之中。我被人波押着押着，到了一座熱鬧的馬戲班前，在馬槽的旁邊，一個塗得雪白的女孩子，以兩隻烏黑的眼，凝望着天空—孩子是瘦得像猴一般。我隨着孩子的視綫，也凝望天空，原來又一顆簇簇盛開的八重櫻，在火光上閃耀着，我想，這個可憐的孩子，正在憶她故鄉的春色吧，正在憶她開在故籬的櫻花吧，不！沒有這樣的閑暇給她，她正在祈禱着在一息以後，不要在馬上墜下來遇到傷害的事情吧！如此那孩子的可憐的姿態，永遠同八重櫻一樣，留在自己的心奧處了。</p>
<p>這時，一隻被雨淋濕的烏鴉，在對面的椿樹上，啼了起來，這驚破了我的回憶，我看看自已，油紙傘雖還擎在手中，但滿身却被雨給吹濕了；而那油紙傘上面，還斑斑地沾滿了櫻瓣。</p>
<p>於是，我總算帶着一顆感傷的心，滿身的雨，走出了植物國。</p>
<h3>誰把水滸的中心放到鄆州？（續完）</h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>改編水滸者的羅貫中，舊題其籍貫為東原，倒是極近鄆州的地方，可是被近來的考據根據筆記疑掉了，現在所寗信的是羅貫中為杭人或太原人。杭州之說，大概只為施耐庵之為杭人，連帶纏入，未必有何根據。水滸中的地理記載，北到大名，南到濟州，東西東昌，里程日期都頗正確，薊州，靑州，東京就不大可靠，對江南的建康無為江州，簡直渺茫，這焉能出於南人之手。說是太原人問題比較少些，但太原人不取近的太行而取遠的鄆州水泊，這取捨有點奇怪。並且魯深由華陰而五台山而靑龍山的旅程記載，也不像是山西人寫的。因此我覺得，寗可考據掉羅貫中，暫勿考據掉東原還穩當些。至若可承認東原羅貫中，他又何以要抬一個錢塘人的本以自重的問題，則大概可推測那時杭本有板本上的權威，或增加的材料，其中有取自杭本小說的。</p>
<p>水滸傳中的地理固可以作推測作者的生地的根據，水滸中的語言，對這方面也很可有帮助，有這兩項直接研究材料，而我們在有了幾十萬字的關於水滸考證文字的現在，仍並未解决作者的生地問題，眞不能不使我們懷疑考據的家所用的方法。</p>
<p>以前考據所注意到的水滸本身上的材料，大致只及故事的增加一點。但也太偏偏重於羅本以後面忽略羅本以前了。國然材料實在太少。但就水滸與宜和遺事不同的各點，也欠分析。舉例說，遺事雖不會說各人的鄉貫，大致是可以看出並無南人的，也沒有宋江迭配江州的事。那末使宋江南邊來一行，帶許多南人上梁山的故事，一定是南人編造的。到水滸大結集才一律加入。供其作根據的，許就是雜劇，也許是與雜劇同來源的或種杭州刊行的故事——或卽郞瑛所說的宋江。</p>
<p>不僅後加的七十二小夥中廣及四方豪傑，大夥中一些已定人物的活動地也被分散四方，李逵的本為山東人雖未改，發跡却移到江州。史進的由東平節級變為華陰公子也是有跡可尋的。水滸中重要的具十回資格者如魯之於五台，石之於薊州，盧之於大名，情形當亦如上。也許各種十回，流行的地點原不同，最後才結集一處。</p>
<p>民衆會高興當地出孟姜女，則高興當地出武松，也是可能的。由杭州的武松墓，我們猶可想見各地人怎樣把水滸人物與其當地關連。水滸的人物本多，因之似未引起兩地同爭一人的事，但各地一定把其所傳說的人在梁山的位置看得極高。也許水滸如不是魯西人寫，宋江的領袖地位也會搖動吧。這也足看出水滸的中心落在鄆州，原是偶然。作者一方面想成就其中心，一方面又受各地傳說的限制，遂顯出支絀的狀態，不正很值我們注意嗎？</p>
<h3>昨日的歌手</h3>
<p>— 白萊</p>
<p>一個作者底藝術的傾向，本質地是由於圍繞着他底週遭的生活形態所决定的。然而社會這有機體是不息地演進着，於是那構成一個作者底藝術觀的生活形態的改變，就會跟作者主觀上的藝術觀發生了絕對的不調和。有着進步的世界觀的，自然是跟着時代的動向而轉向，把兩者間的缺憾彌補了。但那些對將來是毫不信任的，便成為「過去」頑固的支持者。文學上的「昨日的歌手」往往就是這樣形成的。</p>
<p>藝術一到了這些把自己看重過一切的「昨日的歌手」底乎裏，它將不再是為了批判生活跟為了服務人類而存在；而是被削弱到僅作為他個人底心靈的宮庭裏的伴侶而已。所以每一個「昨日的歌手」，除了毫無條件地沉洏於那些已死滅了的金色的日子裏；對於眼前動亂的世紀，他們從來是不屑一顧的。</p>
<p>這裏，將伊凡蒲寗作為一個舉例吧；</p>
<p>一自貧窮寂寞中，</p>
<p>走出家鄉的我，</p>
<p>漂泊在世界上，</p>
<p>却屢屢記起那幼年時代。</p>
<p>幼年時代曾在草原，窪地，田間過了；</p>
<p>也會在和這大道旁相似的濯濯丘岡間過了。</p>
<p>靜寂的，許多人的幼年時代，</p>
<p>却在冷落的廣野中，沒來由地</p>
<p>繁榮了；怕總不止繁榮一次吧？</p>
<p>我一想到到那時代，便覺心酸。</p>
<p>可是怎能就把故鄉忘懷呢？</p>
<p>（借錄方光燾譯文）」</p>
<p>蒲寗是那樣地眷戀着他的過去，從不肯將那「回顧」的眼睛望望前面。因之他對那「許多人的幼年時代」的「繁榮」是認為「沒來由」的；現實是一無所知的。反之，即使他「心酸」的過去，却不能有所「忘懷」。甚至為了這緣故，他甘願替自己唱起挽歌來了：</p>
<p>一一任世運的推移，</p>
<p>我們寂寂地過去，…</p>
<p>不久我們的夕陽將消失了吧。</p>
<p>可是新的太陽也近了，那陽光將露出微笑，</p>
<p>照臨着其他的人們吧。</p>
<p>（錄自同一譯文）」</p>
<p>然而，這樣的命運該不會光是蒲寗一人，而是每一個「昨日的歌手」所共有的吧！</p>
<h3>「人與神」</h3>
<p>— 胡考作</p>
<h3>黃昏時的瑣事（下）</h3>
<p>— 邵冠華</p>
<p>—晤，原來這是我半月前的寓所啊！</p>
<p>想到這是我以前每夜睡下的地方，感到異樣的溫暖；可是現在不自覺的走過去，流浪似的走過去，心上却感到無名的悵惘。</p>
<p>—如果有機會，我或者再來睡一下罷，，然而在勞苦忙碌的生活裏，即使有事過江來，也是忽忙的。究不知何年月日才能現實呢？、</p>
<p>車子移過去，離開舊寓所已有二丈路了。它的影子也完全消失了，我還溫暖地又像悵惘地掛念着它。</p>
<p>不久車子又拉到一條籠罩夜色的江的前面了。江水徵動着，像低語似的。</p>
<p>離開江五尺遠，聳立着幾根崇高的電桿，電光發出金龍似的光芒，照在平閱路口，並不過分的亮。</p>
<p>——唔，我已經五天不走到這條路上了，這條路依舊諧和着江邊的夜色，使人略有些煩悶然而並不使人失望地站着。</p>
<p>——多偉大啊，這條路能够永遠這樣的生存着罷？</p>
<p>我嘆息着。</p>
<p>路口的長的白布的廣告簾子，被風移動一下，露出我半個月前時常去買捲烟的烟舖。</p>
<p>看過去時常和我打招呼的中年而胖胖的店主正在　睡着。</p>
<p>——大概生意淸淡罷？否則這樣早的時刻，不見得會有睡眠的典趣罷，我繼續地想下去。</p>
<p>車子折而到左邊的巷裏去，「小小書社」四字突然在我記憶裏了。</p>
<p>「小小書社」離開此地不遠，是我新認識的朋友符君開的，不知近來生意如何？符君是活潑健談而有「男性美」的新進作家。他在創作餘暇幹了這項工作，在我，倒感到異樣的趣味。日前聽說他是為了游泳受寒氣病了。我也會經在同樣的黃昏時候和蔣君去看他一次。他那憔悴的臉色仍吐出鐘一樣的熱情的聲音，我想他一定很容易恢復他的健談的。在此夜色茫茫的路上，我謹祝他早日康健起來！</p>
<p>車子帶我到另一地方去買了一些東西後，仍舊穿過黑暗的石子路上，帶我到江邊。</p>

<h3>今後之川黔電政</h3>
<p>— 佐</p>
<p>自共匪西竄川黔，中央軍馳往追剿，蔣委員長命駕親征之後，渝筑兩地已成爲西南軍事政治重心，因此渝筑兩地電報局，軍官電報，異常擁擠，報務極形繁忙。交通當局鑒於電信交通與剿匪軍事關係至鉅，迭頒明令，嚴飭各該局工作人員動謹工作，以利戎機。但該兩省電路年久失修，機械復陳舊窳敗，通信能率，比較低落，往返電報，不無稽遲，外間不察，或歸咎於交通當局平時放棄責任，疏於綢繆所致。殊不知交通當局年來對於電政之整理與革新，且有整個的計劃，一貫的政策，着着進行，未嘗稍懈，衡以二年來邊遠地方電臺之相繼設立，甘新青海電報幹綫之逐一修復，可爲明證。第此種計劃與政策之完成，必須中央與地方推誠合作，始克濟事。川黔兩省受命中央，雖已有年，但以歷史與地理的關係，一切措施，究未能脫舊時習氣，兩省電報局長多由駐軍擅委，兩省電政遂亦因以廢弛。川東各省對於部令，尙知奉行，川西及黔區各局，則各省爲政，冊報常積年不至，故其經濟狀況及綫路情形，交部全然隔閡。去年朱家驊部長鑒於各省電政，均已次第整理就緒，川黔不能獨異，曾飭屬擬具計劃興修兩省綫路，冀以便利邊省通信，乃以種種關係，雖屢加督促，並接濟欵料，始終延未實現。</p>
<p>今者蔣委員長駐節彼方，地方當局在此唯一領袖指導啓迪之下，對於中央施政方針，已經明瞭，兩省電信整理計劃之實施，至是亦迎刃而解。一月以來，交通當局對於購運械料，遣派幹員，徵集工丁，查勘綫路等事項均限時到達，計日完成，一切全以快實硬苦之精神赴之，故工事進行，極爲迅速。惟兩省交通阻梗，運輸困難，加之山道險巇，工事設施，有異尋常，雖云迅速，究不能不假以時日。交部有鑒及斯，特另行備齊無綫電機件材料，飛送筑城，趕添電臺，預計拙稿發刊時，該臺已可完成。如斯兼籌並顧，努力從事，行見西南電信交通，從斯暢利，走筆至此，欣慰之情，油然而生！</p>
<p>抑吾人重有感焉：夫交通建設之完成，必須以事權統一，地方合作爲前提，卽以整理電信事業言之，非上述二者具備不爲功。良以電信爲一國之神經系統，茍事權不統一，地方不合作，必影響及於整個計劃之實施，甚至將已有規模之原來建設，亦全然摧毀。證以川黔電政情形，益足置信。從可知中央權力必須鞏固，然後事權方能統一：地方官吏必須明達事理，然後新政始易推行，非然者，不易爲也。再查我國電政，雖云國營，但國　並無補助，純恃報費收入，資以自給。年來百業蕭條，國民經濟，已瀕破產，電信亦隨之一落千丈。舉凡綫路之興修，材料機件之購置，大抵舉債維持，卽如此次整理川黔電政所需之大批材料，其欵項亦挪借而來，此項借欵，均訂有合同，須如期歸還。但以目前電政收入情形，還債殊無餘裕。而另一方面軍官電報之欠費，仍屬有增無減，長此以往，電政事業，非整個崩潰不可。昨年電政會議時，汪院長嘗云：「軍政機關損害電政，卽係損害自己」，斯語良足深味！夫軍官電費，較之整筆軍餉政費，猶如滄海一粟，爲數極微，深望軍政機關體念電政之艱難，勿再拖欠報費，則今後之川黔電政，始有建設之可言也。祈我賢明之軍政領袖注意及之。</p>
<h3>軍用電台不能收拍公衆通信</h3>
<p>— 楨</p>
<p>短波無綫電台，設備簡而行動易，收效頗宏，適合軍用。我北代軍興，利用短波無綫電，名軍設立電台，傳遞軍事消息，用能奠定宇內，清剿匪共，功效固不可沒。顧軍用電台之設立，係補助交通部所辦電報局傳遞軍訊之不足，前者係軍事專用的暫時的性質，後者係民衆公用的永久的性質，二者任務各有不同，統系亦各有別，不容或紊。故當軍事敉平之時，或部辦電局容量足敷應用之時，軍用電台任務，似已減輕，爲疏通他項軍訊起見，有移設他處之必要也。</p>
<p>按照國府公布電信條例第二條：「凡國家經營之電信，由國民政府行政院交通部管理之。惟海陸軍及航空機關爲軍用起見，自行設置者，不在此例。」是海陸軍空電台之設置，全爲軍用，其傳遞消息，必爲軍訊，旣有主管機關，自無越軌行動，故交通部認爲無過問之必要，不在電信條例規定以內。反之，海陸空軍電台，如傳遞私人消息，或傳遞新聞電報，不論其收費與否，及何人所發，此項行爲，已遂反軍用電台之性質，侵越交部電信之營業，與破壞電信條例之規定，交部得依法律上所賦予之權力，從而取締之。此就交部立塲言之，不得不然耳。</p>
<p>再就軍事機關立塲言之，對於私人電報，亦應加以取締。夫軍事機關之有電台，猶人之有耳目，耳目之不能轉借他人，猶軍用電台之不能傳遞私人電報。且軍事通信，最貴機密神速，若許傳遞私人電報，不獨電台之效率，爲之減低，且難免洩露軍事秘密之危險，故軍事機關，對於所屬電台，如有傳遞私人電報，似應嚴加懲辦，以免流弊，如得交通部報告，亦應根究原委，以明眞相。至於利用軍用電台招收新聞電報，未經檢查，遞爾拍發，尤爲軍事機關所不許，此應請軍事當局注意者也。</p>
<p>再就發報人方面言之，不應將所發電報送交或請託軍用電台拍發，理由亦極顯明：良以軍用電台，係供軍用，不能營業，已如上述。社會人士如因節省報費，轉託軍用電台發報，所省報費無幾，而破壞電政系統行爲甚大。一旦軍事機關，查得某台拍發私報，某報係某人所發，歸報查究，依法懲辦，電台人員，違法收電，責有攸歸，而請託人不無串通作弊之嫌疑，難免科以應得之罪也。現今交通部所辦之電報局台，業務迅捷可靠，收費亦極低廉，發報人士一入局門，如顧客之光臨商店，無不歡迎。電報若有延誤，亦可正式查問。何必託交軍用電台拍發，而自誤誤人耶？</p>
<p>近聞交通部據各方報告，某某電台，（姑隱其名）傳遞私人消息，及新聞電報，查有證實。此項電台，交通部自有依法取締之權，咨請主管機關，予以法律上最嚴厲之制裁，作者希望某某電台立予停止拍發上項商電，毋自貽伊戚也。</p>
<h3>論電報現代化與公衆</h3>
<p>— 雲</p>
<p>各國最初創辦電報的動機，大都是爲靈通政治軍事的消息，至於傳遞私人及商家的電報，不過是一種副業。所以當初的電報局一種官氣十足的樣子，我們很容易想像。後來的時代進化，工商業發達，民智提高，電報漸漸地脫離官用爲主的時期，而入於民用爲主的時期。所以「電報商業化」一語，在歐美開明的國家二三十年以前，已經是十分流行，公認爲一件當然的事情。可是在我國實行這個政策，還是最近二三年的事，而且大多數的公衆，還沒有明瞭這件事的意義，不知加以利用，因此使我國電報現代化的過程，進行比較遲緩，實在有點可惜。</p>
<p>什麼呌做「電報現代化」？就是電報局抱着竭力替公衆謀便利減省費用的方針，藉以增加其業務，發展其事業。舉幾個實例來說，英德美諸國電報局在二十年前，就提倡「電話收發電報辦法」，這就是要打電報可以從電話上通知當地電報局抄下後，立刻拘發。而他處有電報發來，經當地電報局接到後，亦可立刻用電話通知收報人。如此一來，使電報的速率增加三四倍，因爲一張電報從甲局傳遞到乙局所需的時間，普通不滿十分鐘，但由發報人送交甲局及由乙局派差送交收報人的時間，平均各需三十分鐘，全程共需七十分鐘。現如改用電話收發電報，則此兩項手續平均各需五分鐘，全程共需二十分鐘，豈非加快三倍有餘。在此事以後，電報打字機的效用漸著，於是英美等國又提倡「專綫收發電報辦法」，就是在發報人，收報人和兩方電局內，均各接通專綫用電報打字機收發電報，這自然比用電話收發電報又一進步了。迨至歐戰以後，因經濟關係，各國盛行各種廉價電報，如夜信電報，日信電報，週末電報，新年及耶誕賀電，而最近美國又有社交電報及送禮電報流行一時。凡此種種，都是想法子迎合公衆需要，便利公衆的通信，電報現代化的眞諦在此。</p>
<p>返觀我國在四五年以前，電報局尙不知「商業化」爲何物，但最近二三年來風氣業已丕變，對於「電報現代化」一事，迎頭趕上，努力爭先，卽以上述各種便利公衆的方法而論，在極短的時期內，均已具備。第一，「市內電話收發電報辦法」，已由交通部於民國二十二年二月一日公佈施行，其這個辦法所規定的，非常周妥便利，較之歐美各國，毫無遜色。第二，「商用專綫收發電報規則」，公布於二十三年三月一日，內分電話機專綫及電報機專綫兩種，電報機又分電報打字機及莫氏機，規定亦極完備。此外如夜信電報日信電報，賀年電報，均經次第實現，而前年創辦之「國內交際電報」尤與美國社交電報相似。於此我人不覺得一感想，卽我國現今的電報局，對於公衆服務之盡力，雖不能謂業已站於時代之前，至少業已趕上時代。但是美中不足，就是我國公衆對於此種電報現代化的潮流，尙無明切的認識。試問本刦讀者之中，已知「電話收發電報辦法」者有幾人？曾經利用交際電報」者有幾人？思至此，深覺我國各種事業之欲求革新進步，須較他國加倍努力，泃不誣也。</p>
<h3>談談公用電話</h3>
<p>— 驊</p>
<p>在吾人日常生活中，電話殆已成爲不可減少之工具。舉凡一切公私事務之接洽，向之必須親往會談者，今茲賴電話之媒介，雖相距天涯，無異咫尺對話。近年以來，益以電話技術之進步，任何長距離之通話，均可利用負載綫圈及　電機之裝置，以減低綫路衰減之作用，使雙方得到清晰之聲浪。晚近更以無綫電話之發明，不特陸地與船舶間可以互相對話，橫越海洋之通話，亦由理想而成事實，其便利爲何如耶。</p>
<p>顧此種科學設備，在一般商行住戶，因業務之需要及便利接洽事務起見，自樂於月納租金，請求裝置，在大多數人民，則以經濟關係，利用者究居少數。交部爲補救此項缺憾起見。爰於上年九月間創辦公用電話制度。俾一般不裝電話之商戶，亦得享受運用電話之權利，以期達到電話營業之大衆化。</p>
<p>按開辦公用電話之地點，現有上海，南京，北平，蕪湖，鄭縣，沙市，陽曲，鎭江，吳縣，懷寗，青島，漢口，烟台，九江等處，各該處電話局，電報局電報收發處及郵政支局內，均置有公用電話，開放營業。使用該項電話者，衹須先將新欲通之電話號數向公用電話管理人掛號，並須付一次通話費，經管理人登記並掣給通話證後，按照所欲接通之電話號數，代爲呌接。接通後，卽由通話人直接通話，故手續極爲便捷。</p>
<p>再公用電話，除與當地各電話用戶通話外，並可與接通長途電話之各處通話。故一般未納長途電話保證金之用戶，如欲使用長途電話時，衹須向附近電報收發處成郵政支局內申請，無復跋涉電話總局之勞矣。</p>
<p>公用電話之通話時間，雖規定以五分鐘或三分鐘（照當地情形而定）爲一次，但其起訖時刻，以接通被呌之號數起至話畢拆綫時爲準。故每次通話，儘可從容接談，且每次市內電話，衹收洋三分至五分（照當地情形而定）卽以時間稍過，次數加多，所費亦極有限。</p>
<p>最近交部於北平，天津，首都，上海，鎭江，吳縣，青島，烟台，武漢等電話局增設交通詢問台，凡（一）市內電話租費及長途電話通話地點及價目，（二）國內外電報通報地點及價目，（三）國內外郵件通達地點及寄費郵資，（四）郵電局每日營業時間，（五）標準時刻，（六）當地發生火警地點，（七）火車輪船及長途汽車開行時刻及價目，（八）各娛樂塲所當日節目及時間，及（九）各地商戶電話號碼等等。均可用電話局詢問台詢問，使用公用電話者，自可得悉上述種種情形之利益，幸國人注意之。</p>
<h3>怎樣使電信民衆化</h3>
<p>— 葆眞</p>
<p>我國電信事業，不能與歐美各國並駕齊驅，但各通都大邑，均已設有電報電話局所，電報方面，有陸綫水綫無綫電，電話方面，有市內電話長途電話。並且已經採用最新式的機械設備，雖不十分完善，可是各種通訊工具應有盡有了。除了通都大邑以外，還有許多面積不大，人口稀少的縣城，市鎭，鄉村莊集等等尙未普遍設有電報局所，如果我們有急要事件，要拍發電報給上項地方的親友，衹能拍發郵轉電報或專送電報。郵轉電報及專送電報，在投遞上當然比較遲緩，自難普遍發展，深入民間。據調查所得，一百通電報之中，難得有二三通，是郵轉電報及專送電報。可見利用有無綫電報作爲通訊工具的人，還衹是少數居住在通都大邑的民衆，電報業務衹能在通都大邑畸形發達，不能够普遍擴展到縣城市鎭鄉村間去。那末，電報的領域太小，電報的發展，也是有限了！</p>
<p>以目前電政經濟的困難，以我國文盲的衆多，電報局臺，自難普遍設立，有無綫電報，一時尙難充分擴展到城鎭鄉村之間。惟有長途電話，尙堪適應一般不識字民衆的需要，因爲長途電話設備簡單，開支甚少，又可以不用文字，傳遞通話人用語言對講，如係詢問事件，當時卽可得到對方回話，更較拍發電報爲便利。所以長途電話，在未設電局地方，尤其在縣城市鎭鄉村之間，確有積極舉辦的必要，俾一般住在內地的民衆，也可享受通訊的便利。現在蘇浙魯等省各縣政府，均已設有市內電話或鄉村電話，通達本縣各村鎭，交通部爲便利民衆通訊起見，訂有縣辦市內電話或鄉村電話與交通部長途或市內電話接綫通話辦法一種，俾設有縣辦　內電話或鄉村電話各地的民衆，可以和設有部辦長途或市內電話各處親友互相通話，（例如上海與同里，蘆墟等處，現在可以互相接綫聯絡通話）豈不便利。此項辦法實行以後，長途電話，當然可以發展，而通訊的功效，當然深入民間了！</p>
<p>浙江省政府已在本省境內設有長途電話多處，交通部已與浙方訂立代收代送電報辦法一種，使民衆可以得到部辦電報與省外長途電話互相聯絡通話的便利，從大體上說，這就是中央政府與地方政府分工合作的表現，其目的均爲便利民衆通訊。我們希望各省政府，現已建設長途者，從速與交通部照浙省辦法，訂立合同，那末，各該省內的縣辦市內電話或鄉村電話，不但與部辦長途電話接綫通話，並且也可代收代送電報了！</p>
<h3>債務整理後之電政</h3>
<h3>最近電報機械設備之改進</h3>
<p>— 葉仲華</p>
<p>三，音響機之裝用　杳吾國電局，除重要之綫路，已裝置自動收發報機外，其餘尙用莫氏機工作，數十年來，迄未改進，不特每年所耗紙條，爲數不貲，且工作時因有紙條可憑，反致疏忽錯誤。交部有鑒及此，特將各報務清閒之電路，一律改裝音響機工作。現經裝竣通報者，有昌樂，德平，霍邱，正陽關，宿遷，沭陽，嵊縣，永嘉，瑞安，古鰲頭等局，據聞成績皆極優良。</p>
<p>四，報話雙用綫路上報話機聯絡之改進　交部爲推廣長途電話起見，凡報務清閒之電路，大批兼通電話。惟在一條綫路上接有三四個局處時，往往因報話機同時出呌，工作發生困難。且因回綫耗阻時常變動，報機繼電器時須調整，通報亦常感阻滯。交部近爲改善起見，特於各報話雙用綫路上之局處，裝置特製之開關，俾通報時，將話機電路截斷，通話時將報機電路截斷，不致再有報話機同時截出，發生工作困難之弊。並於報機大電池上，接一電池加減器，使電流得視回綫耗阻之大小隨時增減，免報機繼電器時加調整之煩。</p>
<p>夫現代科學之進步，一日千里，卽電報機械之發明，亦日新月異。交部對於上述諸端之改進，自不敢引爲自滿。特就記者所知，略舉一二，藉窺交部對於改進電報機械設施之一斑，諒亦爲讀者所樂聞歟？</p>
<h3>倫敦之電視事業</h3>
<p>— 十郎</p>
<p>英國政府因電視委員會委員長塞斯敦爵士（Lord　Selsdon）之報告，正式電視廣播，在倫敦及英格蘭各處，不久可望實現。據該會宣稱，經與英美德多數家家八閱月之審愼商議，高度明切之電視，已發展至可予初步開放公衆業務之程度。郵政督辦伍德（Wood）在衆議院聲稱，政府已批准電視委員會之普通建議，渠當採取適當步驟，促其成就。上項主要建議，主張本事業發剏之初度，在英國廣播公司管理之下，用拜爾及馬可尼兩種機式在倫敦之發射台，輪流運用。上項試騐發射，今年當有開始之可能。雖在某一時期，收受電視之人所費必鉅，但至商用範圍廣大時，卽可減低。</p>
<p>倫敦電視台之設備與維持費，截至一九三六年底止，預算爲八五，〇〇〇金元。現時出產之電視影片，其大小約八吋長六吋寬，但用擴大器可以增加之，惟不甚明顯耳。所用電波，將爲超短波，但據委員會稱此項電波之有效範圍有限，如欲全國相當普及，必需設置多數發射台。據謂高出太唔士河水準二百呎之晶宮塔，將作爲第一次電視廣播之處。自一九三四年六月起，該處已爲拜爾電視有限公司用作試騐塲所，在離晶宮二十五哩之地，影與聲均有良好表演。最近一次之試騐，係用兩具拜爾式家庭電視機（Teleyisors）接受晶宮射出之信號，映出黑白光明之影片，其中價值二百五十金元之一種模型，映出八吋長六吋寬之片，四百五十金元之一種，則映出十二吋長九吋寬之片。又拜爾公司工程師曾表演一種間接發射電影，卽用有聲電影片，發射聲音及形像，自製成電影片及用爲電視所費之時間，僅三十秒鐘耳。</p>
<p>馬可尼氏擬用極微電波，（Micro.Wave）成立歐美間電視之希望。現正在義大利熱諾亞附近，加以實騐。此無綫電發明家，今冬雖忙於倫敦試騐室內，但仍數度往熱諾亞梭正其首席試騐員麥士（M.Mattbieu）之工作，不久當約將再往作最後試騐。馬氏目前亟待解決之問題，卽在獲得一種發射不受干擾不致衰落之長距離信號方法，若然則越洋電視，卽可成功矣。馬氏友人謂渠信仰極微電波，——長約六十生的之發射媒介物——可解決此項問題云。（譯自三月份報話時代）</p>

<h3>電碼預言</h3>
<p>— 廢名（不受酬）</p>
<p>「一九三五」年是「愁」年</p>
<p>試看幾月來各報的國際新聞，都連篇累牘地登載着列強擴張軍備，延長軍役，以及締結互助公約等消息，這種情勢，充分地表示着第二次大戰，已到了積極準備的階段。人們都爲了這未來的大戰，疑懼惶惑着不知那一天才知道牠已明白地預告今後四年間世運的趨勢。牠說：「在（一九三五）年，戰禍不致爆發，不過人們都爲這件事發「愁」而已。到了（一九三六）年，大戰終於爆發了，滔天的罪「愆」，都在這年頭暴露出來。過了這一年，是「一九三七」年，自此否極泰來，大戰結束，宛如大病新「愈」。接着便是「一九三八」年，戰爭的疲乏，已經消逝，人們又是「愉」快地過日子。」這個預言家，確有把握似的告訴我們。讀者若不相信，請閱電碼新編（1935）（1936）（1937）（1938）四字是什麼？</p>

<p>倫敦電話推銷處之開辦</p>
<p>倫敦大聖馬梯（St.martin.s-le-graand）甲盔大廈（Armour　Hcuse）之電話用戶詢問局，已經郵政督辦開辦。關於適合特別需要之話機裝設方式等，可向樓下詢得，而第一層樓則實地表演之。據伍德爵士（Sir　Kingsley　Wood）稱：此所謂市內電話推銷處之開辦，現有一種新的發展，卽自動轉號盤，俾用戶選擇其他用戶之號碼，僅須按杆一下，可得其當時通話之用戶。</p>
<p>法國之電話廣告</p>
<p>郵電部已致力於管理之現代化，三種重要日報，（巴黎午報，巴黎晚報，急進報）已創設一個方法，供廣告藉電話之轉遞，刊登各報紙內。是項廣告費，隨電話收費單，於月終徴收之。惟衹應用於列名於電話薄之用戶。用戶欲登廣告時，應收廣告內容，以及姓名，住址，電話號數等，以電話告知話局，待話局記錄幷查明後，旋得廣告費通知用戶，所有廣告刊費，卽與當月通話費至月終向用戶徵收之。郵電部備有特別引得，使其職員處理此項工作，毫無困難。納費人繳騐電話收費單時，卽付以廣告費。</p>
<p>話局對於此項方法，頗有利益，因每一電話廣告，用戶多打兩次電話，卽局多收兩次話費，幷可向報館徵收每個廣告八十生丁之手續費。此項辦法之推廣，與郵政支票相似之電話支票，正在審樣中。收來電話用戶對於定貨以及月終付欵均可用電話支票行之。但此項計劃，最近尙不實行耳。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>別開生面的遺囑</h3>
<p>— 吹</p>
<p>從前滿淸時代，假定某一要人逝世，便有後人揑造一通遺摺，奏呈皇上，這種遺摺的內容，差不多總是忠君愛國的話頭，猶如現在普通的訃聞，謂幾位要人聞人，題了四個「老成凋謝」或「又弱一個」之類，同樣做裝飾品的，此我國的遺囑所以不值錢也。</p>
<p>前日波蘭的狄克推多畢蘇資基上將逝世，他的遺囑，便別開生面，軍將軍遺囑中，曾表示以其遺腦供解剖之用，以示畢氏尊軍科學的意志，我並非長他人的志氣，滅自己的威風，專門去崇拜外人，但是在這個地方，外人的遺囑，的確比較實際思想比較開通。</p>
<p>人本來是兩元的，一是軀殼，一是靈魂，若靈魂脫離了軀殼，這軀殼便和爛銅爛鐵一樣，還有什麽價值，然而我國人的觀念不同，看死人的遺體，做甚麽寶貝似的，非但不肯弄壞，更要替他矯揉造作，裝飾得十分富麗堂皇，去埋諸地下，現在畢蘇資基的遺囑，把他的心臟，置於其母的足端，他的遺腦，贈與波蘭各大學生，作科學的探討，他的遺體，葬於克拉哥城之伐維爾陵，把他的遺體分成三處，這樣的思想，何等達觀呢。</p>
<p>但是他這樣支配他自己的遺體，並非沒有意思，實有很深的作用，心，運赴其生長地維爾邦城，並且置於其母的足端，便是飲水思源，不忘其本的意思，遺骸，葬於伐爾維陵，該陵是波蘭前王及國家英豪所葬之地，表示其人格的偉大，其用意原顯而易見的，至於以其遺腦供各大學生的研究，這有什麽道理呢？人類的腦筋，是同樣的結構，未必畢將軍的腦筋，格外生得道地，格外生得玲瓏，猶如封神榜中的比干，他人七巧，比午確是八巧。</p>
<p>但是畢將軍的腦筋，雖和常人無異，亦畢竟和常人不同，不然他迭次被人拘禁，迭次事業失敗，而他堅决的志願，非但不肯稍微變易，並且更加堅強起來，試想這樣的精神能力，豈是常人所可及，肌彼之腦筋，必有研究的價值無疑。</p>
<p>茲更舉其一小節言之，畢嘗逃亡於日本，某日擬　日本菜，會在某菜館食生鯉魚，竟食鯉魚之目，若在他人必吐，而畢氏素性剛愎，竟以威斯忌酒為導，下之，可知能忍人所不能忍者，必能為人所不能為，官共為一世英豪也。</p>
<h3>大路的盡頭</h3>
<p>— 程銓</p>
<p>大路的盡頭，是白茫茫的一片，在模糊中攙入了好些凄愴味：橫在那兒的，也許是鐵壁一般堅牢的牆，也許是獄中的柵欄吧？我那麽想；我怕着，打了顫，且開始打量起這參差的，荒蕪成死寂的大路的盡頭來了。</p>
<p>失望，憤怒，日滯疑—自己是踏着艱辛的步子，一拐一拐地涉足過來的啊。經過稚年的夢，經過靑年的熱切，我一步步地把足跡打在時間的沙上（然而接着來的是一陣狂風，把那此給自己所珍視着的過往的足跡也吹亂了！），像一隻病倒了的辛勤的　牛，迂徊在無邊的大路中。</p>
<p>把重重的生之行裝負起了，當時是有多少先知在用賢明的口吻來告訴看我啊！從書本上，從學校的講義與黑板上，從先知所寫下的許多綱要中的亞刺伯數字上——牠們伸出不同的手，指着不同的方向，裝起不同的姿態，發出不同的聲氣，也用了紛雜的，責備與命令的眼光，說：「少年人！將要開始出發向</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>人生途上去旅行的少年人！聽我一句話吧，這兒才是一條大路，一條眞正的，平坦的，沒有盡頭的大路呢！」</p>
<p>紛雜的方向迷亂了年青人的行旅的綫路，他站着，開始向四週展望：那兒是有着一千種聲音在指導，也有一千條的路在迷惑人呢。於是：用了倔強，也用了有限的觀察，終於擺脫了一千種有條件的「好意」與伸出的手（在手的背後，是隱藏着鐐鍊與武器的！）毅然選定了一條縱然是不很平坦，然而却是遙遠與廣闊，延長得看不見盡頭的「大路」，慢慢地走去了。</p>
<p>寂寞啊，艱難啊，困苦啊！在路的前面，是絆足的小石塊與迷眼的砂子：在路的後面，是一千種譏笑的，冷漠的，嘲弄的，怨恨與毒罵的眼睛：「不知道隸屬在別人下面的倔強而亂闖的小犢啊，路是有盡頭的，路是……」</p>
<p>而我，已是好多年來的事情了：在自己所選定的生活的寬大而艱辛的路上打着滾，被刺傷着，被磨折着，被苦難着：而如今，前面的太陽彷彿漸漸地在落下來，徧身是一股冷氣。而且，前面是一片白茫茫的，像牆，像柵欄，大路彷彿是已經預示了一個窒息的盡頭了。</p>
<p>於是，已經是尋思的時候了：「在生活的大路的盡頭，橫着的究竟是什麼呢？障礙嗎？海嗎？烟霧嗎」我開那麼地猜想，我懷疑了。</p>
<p>這個謎是沒有人能回答的，正像生活的大路上不會有代步品一樣；生活的路是要自己去走的，生活的行裝是要自己去挑的。想起了：「人誰都不是先知者，從不充分的目力中得來的遠景，對它，先期的憂愁是與先期的歡喜同樣地不可靠的；在沒有眞正走到大路的最後一寸以前，爲什麼要用可怕的忖度（像冬夜的開着虎黃色的夢一樣可怕的忖度）來測量它呢？</p>
<p>還是用了較安穩的心思來對付那些難付的無數當前的生活之大路上的絆足的石子吧。不清楚的路的那邊是不值得去想的：也許在大路的盡頭是一涯天藍色的小水，三兩枝發青的嫩草：也許便眞是可怕的絕壁與深淵。人生的小景是難以描盡的；人衹能大膽地走到它前面用了勇敢的聲調去誦讀：「也許在大路的盡頭是……」</p>
<h3>沒有雨的紅雨天</h3>
<p>— 凈夫</p>
<p>秀美的大理石的故鄉，有一個「沒有月亮的月夜」那麼澄潔的景色；也還有一副「沒有雨的紅雨天」的奇緻，在懷抱着大理的勝妙萬千的蒼山上。</p>
<p>臨洱海，靠蒼山。洱海似面美絕的天鏡；蒼山呢？更是遍處皆勝景呵。從頭到尾，盡是各有特色的，奇妙的十八溪，十九峰連佈而成的名山。站在每一峰上，是看到兩旁夾着悠美婉歌的雙溪；但立於每條溪旁，却變爲溪介蒼巍動魄的兩峰間，每溪每峰，都各具完全不同的奇景，眞是山水之靈！</p>
<p>當遊客跋踄的從蒼山頭玩過雲路峰，斜移溪，而沿滄浪峰，萬花溪，五台峰，陽溪以過；沒有雨的雨天，便是出現在緊連陽溪的蓮花峰和白雲峰夾着茫湧溪中間形成的一景。</p>
<p>茫湧溪是從蓮花與白雲兩峰間，瀉流而下，名呌茫湧，其波湧茫奔，勢色雄美，不難想像出牠的姿態吧！</p>
<p>蓮花峰和白雲峰的中部，盡是岩石險峻，削壁難近的處所，聳鬰驚心，茫湧溪的奔流下沖，到這裏便猛觸岩壁，終年急流擊壁，淙淙而嗚，也就形成水花亂濺雄迸，四處飛射，比大瀑布的水景來得更奇美難得的巧緻。</p>
<p>恰好在這兒，白雲峰臨茫湧溪的側面岩壁及旁邊，稍傾低些；於是飛濺的水花，都斜集白雲峰之側，那裏一帶的地方，便有終年下雨，不雨的雨天之稱。</p>
<p>而要觀玩兩峰和茫湧溪的中間的景色，便也必得走近到這沒有雨的雨天的處所，才可較看清一些：所以遊人們常遙望驚心動魄的茫湧溪而爲之神馳，就不能不爬近不雨的雨天的處所，置身這美妙出塵的奇緻中，臨雨以觀玩。一種驚喜稱異的幽美的心情，自然而然的　來，而爲之凝神。</p>
<p>山間鬰鬰蒼蒼，不斷的奏着淙淙如金石之鳴　的大自然的，震人心絃的歌調，雨珠陣陣濺灑，河山都像一副起舞而歌的活的圖書，使人忘形骸於濁世，大有　靈徹骨之慨。</p>
<p>雨，又爲什麼是紅色的呢？看吧！再遠遠細望茫湧溪上流的白波，過　，　變成紅浪了。同時，　　　　名　紅　岩。因那兒岩壁險峻，人莫　近，只能遠遠看到溪水猛　，　　紅　　　　。曾有過一次，溪水　　　　　　　　這紅木是比牛角還堅硬，所以人們猜爲，那岩壁間生長了久年的紅木，所以水衝過而成紅浪。</p>
<p>而紅木，是很可貴重的。可是我們的這河山的主人，是沒有打理牠；却在十多年前，有過一個外國工程師特地去測騐，自己還冒險用機器載下去探看，結果不幸是給溪水吞沒了，把屍首沖到蒼山下。</p>
<p>從此，便沒人去問津。只整年看到，紅色的洪浪在飛濺，活像下着紅雨，傾集白雲峰側，形成那終不息的，沒有雨的紅雨的出塵的奇緻。</p>
<h3>榴槤姑娘</h3>
<p>— 晶雲</p>
<p>晚飯後，踏着滿圓的月亮，沿着恬靜幽美的江灣路走去，悠悠然地，口里吹着輕鬆的，富着南國情調熱情奔放的口哨。風，夾雜着花香的氣息，陣陣地，溫柔地飄拂着，宛如少女的輕軟細膩的心情，撫拂得人們的心旌都陶醉了。五月的風，是多麼甜蜜愉快的呵！</p>
<p>江灣路和東體育會路的轉角，矗立一座雄偉高大的洋房。洋房的四週，圍繞着層層繁茂的林木。洋房里的電燈光，閃爍爍地從黑陰陰的葉縫里透射出來，襯着大地上溶成一片銀也似的月光，越顯出美麗靜謐的，這便是兒時的遊伴的黃則仁的家呵。</p>
<p>輕輕地在鐵門的邊緣上按一下電鈴，鐵門上的小窗就啞的一聲開了，探出管門人的兩隻鼠兒眼來，小鼠兒似的儘對我端詳着，我忙從衣袋里抽出一張名片來，遞給他說：</p>
<p>「找黃則仁先生。」</p>
<p>約莫過了三分鐘之後，鐵門終於開了。迅速地我瞧見黃則仁從　里跨出來，連跑帶跳地走到石階上，伸出手兒來，遠遠地向我招呼着。他依然和幾年前一樣，一點沒有改變，一個矮碩的小夥子呀！</p>
<p>「小凌，你來得正好，我們剛在剝榴梿，榴梿，曉得嗎？你最留戀眷念的榴梿呀！哈哈！……」他緊拉着我的手，似乎很得意，嗓音越說越宏亮，隨後又打着哈哈的笑了。</p>
<p>「你什麼時候從南國——　羅——回來呢？可曾帶來什麼好的消息嗎？」我們很　　地緊拉着手兒，一面談着走進客　里去。應上，則仁的媽媽和弟妹們正　　　　　子很高興地在剝着榴梿　。那濃郁的香味，洋溢着整個的客廳，多甜美香郁的南國的佳菓呵！</p>
<p>吃了榴梿，就使我想起南國的榴　姑娘來。她有着兩顆黑溜溜滿含着火熱似的熱情的眼珠子，談起話來是多麼溫存大方，一點也沒有番妮子的蠻性和不近人情的態度。這年輕的姑娘呀，雖則和我已隔別了好多個年頭，但她給我的一切的印象，却深深地烙印在我的腦際，永恒地存留着。</p>
<p>每當榴梿上市的時候，在皎潔明朗的月夜，我總喜歡和則仁兩個人划着一葉扁舟，沿着富有詩意如練恬靜的湄南河，直划到網鑾的三角港的榴梿船上去購買榴梿。有一天晚夜，我們於無意間在一艘榴梿船上發現了這美麗嫻靜的榴梿姑娘了。</p>
<p>日子像湄南河的流水般的消逝下去，榴梿姑娘和我們也由主顧而漸漸地發生了友情了。她時時爲我們揀留着上等的榴梿；毫不羞澀地坐在船舷上和我們談天；有時還坐着我們的小舟，直放到蜿　如鍊的江心去蕩漾，欣賞中天晶潔的明月。她的銀鈴般的聲音，給我們講述了許多關於她的家里的瑣事，和各式各樣的菓實的種植，一直流連到夜闌人靜的時分，她才悻悻的歸去。</p>
<p>當我將離開南國的前一夜，我們三個人又蕩着一葉輕快的小舟，停留在江心上任憑它自己去逐波飄流。榴梿姑娘若有所思的緘默着，頭兒緊靠着我的胸膛，兩顆滿含着火般的熱情的眼珠子，儘管對着天上的月亮出神地呆望着。</p>
<p>「麗娜，我將要和你分別了，明天，明天我是要回唐山去了。」</p>
<p>「呃，唐山，…唐山那地方，聽媽說：是很美麗的呵！」</p>
<p>「那你也想去玩玩嗎？」</p>
<p>她沉默了一會，終於搖蕩着腦袋說：「媽不肯讓我離開，」聲音帶着一點傷感的凄其，眼眶已是濕潤潤了。</p>
<p>當我看見榴梿的時候，就使我想起南國的榴梿姑娘，她的容貌的秀麗，舉　的大力，都深刻地烙印在我的腦際永恒地存留着。</p>
<h3>品茗</h3>
<p>— 金人</p>
<p>把「吃茶」說得斯文一點是「品茗」，人顯的　　　　　　　起來的：做了笨重的工作，對着茶壺嘴灌了個飽，那是吃茶：把每天的光陰浪費在茶樓里則曰品茗。最近我喜歡獨自上茶樓，似乎是屬於第二類的了，然而每當紅日西沉，拖着蹣跚的步伐歸家的時候，每次後悔自己太消沉，把光陰在茶樓里打發過去我們是沒有這福份的；卽使你失業了，也應該把品茗的時間來想一點補救辦法，苦澀的茶味是象徵着你的前途呵！</p>
<p>但是被痛苦嚙嚼着自家的心底時候，我又出現在茶樓了。我想把這難挨的日子過去得快一點，而採取這步驟的時候同時思量着更有打發時間的其他方法嗎。我是沒有吃茶的經騐的。做童子軍的時候，至今使我牢記着的是敎練員的「喝白開水衛生」底信條。雖然後來學會了喝咖啡和可可，對於這中國三大出之產一，出售的商店用增加的數目字來開設分店，在自己市塲上銷路驚人的茶樣的我就永遠沒有想起過牠有抽大烟同葉，效力。</p>
<p>小時也曾每天牽着祖父的袍角上茶樓去，煤油燈亮起來的時候再牽着祖父的袍角歸家。然而吃茶（或品茗）對於我並不發生興趣，使我高興的倒是茶樓：因爲那里有許多數不清的把我腦子都弄壞的公公伯伯之類。他們對於一位同志的孫兒是特別優待的，有呌賣的小販上樓的時候，總得破費一點零錢作成他們一筆小小的生意。日後祖父竟然允許我在各個小販的籃中自由抓取喜歡的吃食了。還有個更大的原因，是鎭上有什麼熱鬧的事故，譬如孩子最喜歡的賽會，做社戲，如果像姐姐一樣的不上茶樓而想去瞧一次熱鬧，始終沒有允許的希望的。衹有在茶樓上，你的要求就沒有一回被拒絕的，所以那個額角上生着大瘡疤的茶爐手阿根我特別喜歡他，有時候他簡直瞞過了祖父帶我東西亂闖。</p>
<p>現在祖父的孫兒是一個兒子的父親了，而且祖父時代的一切都和祖父一樣地死亡了，負上了祖父的重任之後，却眞像祖父似的上起茶樓來。每天喝着苦澀的茶，不由地翻騰着黃金時代的夢了。</p>
<p>但是對於吃茶還是沒有經騐。我是孤獨地佔在角里，那地位面對着窗外的一座鐘樓。茶博士對於初次來的主顧亦是堆着笑臉問「用過飯沒有？」的套語的，我每天到來，他是彷彿朋友一般地迎接我了，有時候他談起報紙上沒有記載的新聞來，也會掏出烟捲來授這末一枝，我感謝他把我的時間迅速地送了過去。但是那個茶樓生意太好了，我們很少暢談的機會。那些品茗的同志呢，我腼腆着去高攀他們，我是連「吃茶」都沒有學會的呵！有一天我的缺點被茶博士發現了，我更是不敢向他們偷視一眼，或許那些衣冠楚楚的人物會想起和他們衣服相反的念頭來的。於是我始終注視着那所鐘樓，希望牠一下子跳過了幾個數字。這種苦惱的情形是衹有自家知道的，還想免強雅起來說是品茗嗎？那苦澀的茶味是象徴着你的前途呵！</p>

<h3>Headquarters Staff Orders General Attack on Xu's Bandits, Jiangyou's Siege Could Be Lifted in Days, Wang and Hu's Troops Reach Destinations</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Military news: Xu's bandits' main force is still between Jiangyou, Zhongba, and Beichuan. Our Sixth Route Army's Wang Zhiyi's troops have reached the front line. Hu Zongnan's division's attack on Beichuan has also reached its destination. It is reported that the Headquarters Staff ordered all units to implement a general attack on the 15th.

<p>(Chongqing) A certain member of the Staff Office told a Central News Agency reporter on the 15th that the Zhu-Mao troops' conspiracy to cross the Jinsha River and join forces with Xu's bandits was long seen through by the military authorities. Important locations have been heavily guarded, with Liu Wenhui's troops stationed there. The central army, Xue Yue, Li Baobing, and other units, are pursuing and attacking, having reached the Jinsha River, and will eliminate the remnants of Zhu and Mao's bandits in the Huidong area. As for the rumors that the bandits have fled to Xichang, they are completely untrue. (15th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<h3>Beiping-Shenyang Through Train Derailment</h3>

<h3>Elevation of Sino-Japanese Envoys, Announced by Both Sides Today</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The elevation of Sino-Japanese envoys was discussed once during Wang Zhengting's term as Foreign Minister, but then shelved. Recently, Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota advocated Sino-Japanese friendship, and proposed to upgrade the Minister to China to Ambassador. After Arata Ariyoshi returned to China, it was discussed again and a decision was made to formally seek our consent, and we have replied with consent. It is reliably learned that at 5 PM on the 15th, Japanese Consul General Suma, representing the embassy, ​​visited Tang Yuren of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to describe the Japanese government's determination to upgrade the embassy in China, and agreed on the timing of the announcement by both parties, with talks lasting for half an hour. Regarding the elevation of the envoys of the two countries, both sides agreed to announce it simultaneously at 10 AM on the 16th. The content of our announcement document is a description of the elevation process. As for the first Japanese Ambassador to China, Arata Ariyoshi is scheduled to come to China in early June to present his credentials. Our country's first Ambassador to Japan is also set to be Chiang Tso-pin, and all procedures have been completed. It is reported that the organization of our embassy in Japan will still follow the practices of the embassies in the Soviet Union and Italy. The budget for all expenses, etc., has been slightly increased and agreed upon, which is sufficient for office work. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The issue of the elevation of Sino-Japanese envoys has been largely decided after consultations between the two countries. The Japanese Consul General in Nanjing, Suma, visited Tang Yuren of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 5 PM on the 15th to negotiate. It is reported that this matter has been agreed upon by both parties and will be announced simultaneously on the 16th. (15th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese side completed all procedures regarding the elevation of the legation to China on the 14th. The Chinese side's procedures can also be completed within one or two days, so it is necessary to appoint Minister Chiang as Ambassador before the 16th. A request for consent will be submitted to Japan. Therefore, on the 18th, Tokyo and Nanjing will formally announce the elevation simultaneously. (15th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government has decided to appoint Ariyoshi as the first ambassador to China, and the official announcement will be made on May 17. (15th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Authorities Plan to Expand Beijing Consulate, British Embassy in China to be Upgraded</h3>
<p>(London) The authorities announced in the House of Commons today that the expenditure of 6,000 pounds for the renovation of the British Consulate in Nanjing has been approved, and the project will begin as soon as possible.

<p>(London) Today the House of Commons met, Conservative MP Knox asked when British Ambassador to China Cadogan last visited Beijing and Shanghai, and how long he stayed in those two places. Foreign Secretary Simon replied that the ambassador arrived in Beijing on March 11, arrived in Shanghai on April 3, stayed in Shanghai until April 8, and then returned to Nanjing before returning to Beiping. The ambassador has spent most of his time in China, Central China, Nanjing, and Shanghai since arriving in the Far East, and has also visited various places with important British interests. He visited Guangzhou and the Southwest last November. The British Consulate in Nanjing is currently being expanded so that the British Ambassador's representative can be permanently stationed there and live comfortably. (15th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Simon said in the House of Commons today in response to a question from Conservative MP Molson that the issue of reducing the status of the Nanjing Consul has not been raised. Recently, in order to facilitate the work of British diplomats in Nanjing, the government has decided to send an embassy secretary to serve as Consul and also as a First Secretary. (15th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to reliable Japanese sources, British Counselor Todd visited Foreign Vice Minister Ohta today and informed him that the United Kingdom intends to upgrade its embassy in China, but this statement could not be confirmed by the British Embassy here. (15th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>Zichuan Coal Mine Rescue of Miners at the Bottom of the Mine, Miners' Families Demolish Office, Shandong Authorities Send Troops to Maintain Order</h3>
<p>(Qingdao) The water outflow from the Zichuan coal mine has not stopped so far. The water level has increased by about one meter in a short period of time. Last night at 5 PM, it rose from the bottom of the mine to 24 meters to the eighth coal seam, leaving only 46 meters (200 feet from the tenth coal seam). Therefore, in order to protect the water suction machine of the eighth coal seam, a dam is currently being built. (15th Dentsu dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Today, the Shandong Great Company is digging old tunnels in the eighth-layer well, hoping to dig through to the tenth layer to rescue the trapped workers. Forty meters have been dug, and another twenty meters can be connected. Sounds of people have been heard inside, and it is hoped that some may still be alive. Also, because the water pumps were completely destroyed, water pumps were borrowed from the Qingdao and Dalian administrations and the Fushun coal mine. The Qingdao machine will arrive tonight, while the Dalian machine will take a week. There were originally 900 workers in the well. Apart from the hundred or so rescued at the time, there are at least 700 inside. It has been confirmed that Japanese technician Lan Yuan Zengzang, surveyor Yuan Rongfang, Chen Sikui, and five worker representatives are all inside. The exact number of workers is still unknown. According to the previous example of the Shandong Great Company, the compensation for each deceased worker is 252 yuan, and the burial fee is 50 yuan. Based on this calculation, this accident will require more than 200,000 yuan in compensation and burial fees, and the machine loss is 1 million yuan. Previously, 2,500 tons of coal were produced every day, but now only 500 tons are produced. The workers' families demolished the office and accounting department on the 14th. They dispersed after persuasion. Today, it is still calm. At 4 AM this morning, the water in the well was still rising, one meter per hour. After 5 AM, it gradually slowed down. After 9 AM, it rose 40 centimeters per hour. In the afternoon, it only rose 10 centimeters per hour. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) More than 500 family members of the victims of the Shandong Great Coal Mine gathered at the mine office at 11 AM on the 14th, crying and making trouble, destroying equipment and other items, and the order was greatly disturbed. The Zichuan County Government dispatched police to maintain order before it subsided. The Shandong Provincial Government dispatched a company of soldiers from Boshan to the mine on the evening of the 14th to suppress it. The water level on the tenth floor rose, and it only gradually slowed down at 9 AM on the 15th, retreating to 40 centimeters per hour. It has now reached the bottom of the North Well, and it is confirmed that they are digging a pit in Nanwang Shilizhuang to rescue them. 150 miners from the southern part of the mine can hopefully be rescued. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) A reporter went to Zichuan Shandong Great Coal Mine for inspection. In the car from Zhangdian to Zichuan, there were many family members of the victims. Those who went to visit were all weeping. After arriving at the mine, the workers were mostly frowning and tearful, which was unbearable to witness. Many family members were crying around the mine. In one village, 29 families were all victims. The mine is named a Sino-Japanese joint venture, but in fact Chinese staff directors give up their rights and never ask about things, so most of the people in the office are foreigners.

<h3>Budget for the 24th Year Still Under Study, Minister Kong's Remarks</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi initially planned to go to Tangshan for recuperation on the evening of the 15th, but due to a matter to discuss with President Wang, he went to the official residence of the Ministry of Railways to visit Wang. According to Kong, the budget for the 24th year is still under study. Government spending must be reduced by about 20% to balance income and expenditure. At present, the national treasury is short of funds, and national industry and commerce are in a slump. There is no way to plan economic construction. Public bonds cannot be issued again, and even if they are issued, the people will not be able to bear them. At present, the country has to repay more than 200 million yuan in various debts every year. Such continuous increases are not a good plan. We can only strive for a balanced budget. There is no plan to reduce or merge agencies with fewer affairs. It was previously rumored that there are several countries extremely willing to invest in international loans. I believe that a country's finances are the same as the economic principles of individuals. Save where you can, and it is best not to borrow if you can. After borrowing, you have to repay the debt every year and pay interest, which will naturally increase the burden. The accumulation of debt is not a good strategy. I don't want to raise debts easily, and there is currently no need to borrow. President Wang's health is gradually recovering. Whether the income tax will be levied on the first day of next month is still a question, because after submitting it to the Central Political Council of the Executive Yuan for review, it still needs to be reviewed by the Legislative Yuan, and it is questionable whether the time will be enough.

<h3>Unjust Imprisonment Compensation Movement</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>The National Lawyers Association, in the spirit of rescuing from fire and drowning, is actively engaging in the unjust imprisonment compensation movement during the assembly of judicial leaders to rectify discipline. The aim is to realize a national compensation system so that those wrongly accused may find relief. This movement to protect human rights is indeed a recent event worthy of attention.</p>
<p>The fundamental cause of unjust imprisonment in the judiciary is the violation of justice in trials. Judicial trials are based on the demands of justice, using the power of action to promote the realization of fair and reasonable judgments. Therefore, justice is the foundation of judicial adjudication. Violation of justice, with elements of negligence or intent in the judgments, constitutes unjust imprisonment. It is an undeniable fact that the judicial system in our country has not yet reached a sound state. There are indeed many judicial officials who are honest, upright, and law-abiding, and who adhere to justice when handling cases. However, it is unavoidable that some may have questionable conduct and knowledge, and may not base their decisions on justice. Innocent and good people suffer unjust accusations, or are punished too severely for minor offenses, leading to ruined families and self-harm. Or, they may be filled with resentment and make appeals, creating a sense of social injustice. The tragic phenomenon of the old saying, "A stroke of red ink in the courtroom, a thousand drops of blood on the steps," can still be seen frequently in today's China. It is clear that human rights are not adequately protected. The National Lawyers Association, aware of this, has risen up to prepare suggestions to the government for the implementation of a national compensation system for judgments made through negligence or intent, and to suggest that the legislative authorities enact unjust imprisonment compensation laws. This is certainly appropriate.</p>
<p>If we look abroad, we see that in the rule-of-law countries of the world, whether in public or private law, compensation is always provided for damages suffered by the people due to the actions of their government agencies. For example, both England and America have provisions for unjust imprisonment compensation in their case law. Italy has directly stipulated it in the criminal procedure law. Austria before the rule of Dollfuss, and Germany before the rule of Hitler, even enacted special laws to regulate the compensation for unjust imprisonment. Although our country has not yet achieved complete rule of law, the Judicial Yuan and the Ministry of Judicial Administration have recently shown a strong intention to actively reorganize the judiciary. For example, revising the time limit rules for criminal appeals, deciding to promote a three-level, three-trial system in fourteen provinces, and regularly convening judicial conferences, all show a tendency to urgently achieve complete rule of law. The further demand by the National Lawyers Association to establish an unjust imprisonment compensation system in order to provide an additional layer of protection for the rights and interests of the people is something that the people of the country eagerly hope for. However, going a step further, unjust imprisonment compensation can only provide relief after unjust imprisonment has occurred. It is difficult to prevent the occurrence of unjust imprisonment. The relief is passive. As for active relief, it lies in preventing the occurrence of unjust imprisonment. And the method to prevent the occurrence of unjust imprisonment is to seek perfection of the judicial system. Therefore, we deeply hope that the judicial authorities can grant the request of the National Lawyers Association, so that passive relief can be realized, and also strive to improve the judiciary in order to create active relief.</p>
<h3>Stalin and Laval's Long Talk: Franco-Soviet Understanding Reached; Important International Policies Involved; Poland Agrees to Join Security Pact</h3>
<p>(Moscow) According to authorities this afternoon, French Foreign Minister Laval and Stalin, along with other leaders, have reached an understanding. Today's meeting between the two countries' diplomats involved important issues of both countries' international policies, lasting several hours. After the talks concluded, it was announced that both sides had reached an understanding, but the details of the understanding have not yet been disclosed. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) French Foreign Minister Laval met with Communist Party Secretary-General Stalin for two hours today. The matters discussed were the same as those discussed by Laval with Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov yesterday. It is reported that Polish Foreign Minister Beck has agreed to Poland joining the general security and non-assistance to aggressor nations pact, but with conditions regarding the German and Lithuanian issues. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) This morning, French Foreign Minister Laval and Communist Party Secretary-General Stalin held talks for two hours. On the French side were the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lerey, and the Ambassador to Russia, Alphand. On the Soviet side were the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, Molotov, Foreign Commissar Litvinov, and the Ambassador to France, Potemkin. The talks continued until noon, when Stalin invited Laval and his entourage to lunch. It is noted that this is the first time Stalin has hosted a foreign cabinet member for lunch. The talks continued during and after the meal. Afterwards, Laval told a special correspondent from Havas, "My meeting with Mr. Stalin lasted four and a half hours. The entire process was not only pleasant but also harmonious. The lunch can also be described as a gathering of close friends. We discussed all current diplomatic issues with the closest spirit of cooperation." A joint communiqué on the talks will be issued tomorrow. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) French Foreign Minister Laval visited the Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, Kalinin, yesterday and spoke for half an hour. Laval told a TASS reporter, "I came to Moscow because I am concerned about peace. The Franco-Soviet agreement I signed has made the cooperation between the Soviet Union and France particularly close. This trip will certainly further enhance the friendship between the two countries." (TASS dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Laval in the Russian Capital: Busy with Social Engagements All Day</h3>
<p>(Moscow) French Foreign Minister Laval met with Soviet Russian Communist Party Secretary-General Stalin for a long time this morning, discussing various aspects of the Franco-Soviet agreement. Laval also visited the Chairman of the Central Executive Committee, Kalinin, with Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov and French Ambassador Alphand. At noon, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars Molotov hosted a banquet for Laval. Those present included Litvinov, Alphand, and other diplomatic dignitaries, as well as many other officials of the Soviet Russian government. No official statement was released regarding the repeated talks, but it is said to be of a general nature. The most important meeting was held yesterday. The famous opera "Sadko" will be performed tonight to entertain Laval. All members of the Council of People's Commissars, the French delegation, staff of the French Embassy, and members of the diplomatic corps will attend the performance. The opera will also be broadcast by foreign radio stations. (Guomin News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) In the afternoon, Laval visited the Stalin Automobile Factory. In the evening, he and Foreign Commissar Litvinov went to the National Opera House to listen to the famous opera "Sadko." The crowd enthusiastically cheered for Laval. The orchestra played "La Marseillaise" and "The Internationale" successively. Laval's beloved daughter and Litvinov's wife watched the performance in the former imperial box. After the opera, French Ambassador Alphand hosted a banquet for Laval at the embassy. Molotov, various People's Commissars, members of the diplomatic corps, and representatives of the press from various countries were invited to attend. Also, at noon today, the Director of the Information Department of the Foreign Commissariat, Umansky, hosted a banquet for French journalists at the Tushino airfield, 20 kilometers from Moscow. Umansky delivered a speech on the spot, praising the officers of the Soviet Air Force, saying, "They are prepared to descend from the sky to be the pillars of the motherland." He further stated that the press of France and Russia are in an important position for the cause of calming people's hearts. After the banquet, French reporters visited various facilities of the airfield, and paid particular attention to the newly built giant aircraft "Gorky." (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Litvinov to Officially Visit Paris; Russia Agrees Not to Propagate Communism in France</h3>
<p>(Paris) Local newspapers welcome the long talk between Foreign Minister Laval and Stalin yesterday, recognizing that the Franco-Soviet agreement has been finalized. The "Voltaire" newspaper states that Laval's stay at the Kremlin was very important. Politicians in both countries believe that the agreement constitutes a true alliance. Yesterday's talks can be seen as the first invocation of the agreement and the first result of the agreement on domestic and foreign issues. This can be inferred from the official statement to be released today. The agreement will satisfy all parties in France. The newspaper and other newspapers' Moscow dispatches state that the agreement will develop in economic, military, political, and cultural aspects. The general staffs of the two countries will hold meetings this summer. The issue of Germany and Poland joining the Eastern European Pact was also discussed, but the two decided that if the accession of Germany and Poland to the Eastern European Pact becomes a reality, the right to free action should not be restricted, and the Polish demands preventing the Soviet Union from concluding agreements with neighboring countries should not be recognized. Cultural cooperation between the two countries should be promoted by the Soviet Union adopting French and exchanging professors. Litvinov will also officially visit Paris. (Guomin News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact will inevitably have an impact on the Communist Party's anti-militarist propaganda. Newspapers today are commenting on this matter. "Le Petit Parisien" states, "After the conclusion of the Franco-Soviet talks, a formal communiqué will be released tomorrow, which will inevitably involve the need for France to strengthen its national defense. France's military efforts are not only to protect its own national interests, but also to assist the Soviet Union. This is something that followers of the Third International should not wantonly undermine." The famous reporter Bertin wrote an article in the "Echo de Paris" stating, "The Third International believes that if the branches in various countries misinterpret the instructions issued by the headquarters, the headquarters cannot correct them. This statement is not credible, and Foreign Minister Laval does not find it satisfactory. It is heard that the issue of Communist propaganda has been completely resolved, and the communiqué to be issued tomorrow will state this in solemn terms. This was decided by the Soviet dictator Stalin." The "L'Humanité" newspaper, defending the French Communist Party's anti-militarism, stated, "The Red Army is an extension of the factory, and Soviet workers are powerful hosts of the factory, serving socialism. As for the French army, it is a tool of banking and industry, and the officers all come from pan-fascist groups." (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The "Pravda" editorial welcomes French Foreign Minister Laval's visit to the Soviet Union, while discussing Franco-Soviet relations and the struggle for peace. It states, "The characteristic of Franco-Soviet relations in the past four years has been their increasing cooperation to seek security and the consolidation of world peace. For seventeen years, the Soviet Union has resolutely implemented its peaceful policy. The certainty of this policy increases with each year, because it is based on the increasing economic, political, and military strength of the Soviet state. The Soviet Union has all the necessary conditions to maintain its further peaceful development. At the same time, it has all the necessary conditions to crush those who recklessly hope to invade its territory. Although the Soviet Union still fully supports individual countries to promote peace and implement the expansion and deepening of unity, this is because the Soviet government firmly believes that once a war breaks out anywhere, the laboring masses will have no peace. The Soviet Union can distinguish certain countries whose authorities are trying to take adventurous actions and seize the territory of others (they are unwilling to go to war for various reasons and are willing to maintain peace). We know very well that France is uneasy, and there are sufficient reasons, because in another place there is open challenge propaganda, sometimes under the pretext of establishing a world commonwealth, to seek to benefit a certain imperialist country and turn the people of Europe into subjects of a certain 'superior race.' The peaceful motives of French foreign policy are sufficient to be the basis for the firm and effective cooperation between the Soviet Union and France. "Pravda" also reiterated the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact, restating the hard efforts of the diplomats of the Soviet Union and France to seek the signing of the Eastern European Pact, which ultimately failed due to the refusal of Germany and Poland to participate. This alone is sufficient to fully demonstrate the necessity and timeliness of the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact. If any government in Europe publishes an agreement to maintain peace, then all countries wishing for peace have the right and the necessity to unite and eliminate adventurous actions. The direct purpose of the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact is to wish to maintain peace. The Franco-Soviet Agreement is the result of the increasing amity between France and the Soviet Union. At the same time, it is a new foundation for strengthening this amity in order to promote peace. (TASS dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Tens of Thousands of People in Paris Turned Out to Watch Air Defense Exercises; Minister of Aviation Returns from Italy</h3>
<p>(Paris) Paris held an exercise this morning to defend against air strikes. At around 10:00 a.m., sirens wailed in six locations, warning the entire city of an enemy air raid. Police and firefighters, wearing yellow gas-proof uniforms, pointed helmets, and black masks, rushed to the places they believed the enemy would drop gas bombs. Fire trucks raced through the streets at speeds of 40 miles per hour. At the same time, rescue vehicles transported those poisoned by gas to underground emergency clinics, which were curtained with rubber to prevent contact with outside air. Tens of thousands of Parisians gathered on both sides of the Boulevard Saint-Germain to watch. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Turin. French Minister of Aviation General Denain visited Italy. After completing his duties, he returned to the country, arriving here from Rome at 4:00 p.m. Local civil and military officials all went to the airfield to welcome him. General Denain, representing the French government, presented the Commander of the Turin Aviation District, General de Testchiagni, with the Third Class of the Legion of Honor. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to a dispatch from Rome to the "Le Matin," during the talks in Rome, French Minister of Aviation Denain discussed the possibility of Franco-Italian military cooperation in the air, but there were no concrete results. Therefore, these talks will continue in London and Paris. However, the term "Franco-Italian Air Defense Agreement" is actually incorrect, because according to the decision made at the Stresa Conference, any air defense cooperation should be jointly participated in by Germany, England, and Belgium. France and Italy cannot conclude an agreement alone. (Guomin Electric, 14th)</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Considers Expanding Air Force; Plans to Increase Threefold in Two Years</h3>
<p>(London) According to a "Daily Telegraph" aviation reporter today, the cabinet is currently considering a plan to expand the British Air Force. The government is now considering increasing the domestic air defense force threefold within two years, from 43 squadrons with a total of 498 aircraft to 128 squadrons with a total of 1,460 aircraft. The extra aircraft will roughly double the total strength of the Royal Air Force. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Austria Decides to Imitate Germany, Violating Treaty and Establishing Air Force; Appoints Starhemberg as Commander</h3>
<p>(Vienna) Austria is now following in Germany's footsteps, violating the Treaty of Saint-Germain and taking steps to establish an air force. Tonight, the staff of the Home Guard convened a meeting, deciding to organize a special Home Guard flying corps, with Starhemberg as the commander-in-chief. Political circles view this as a test of the attitude of the Little Entente countries towards the Austrian air force. It is widely believed that the signatory countries of the recent Balkan Pact, namely Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey, discussed the rearmament of Austria during their meeting in the Romanian capital. Although the meeting did not issue a communiqué, it is heard that it was decided to oppose the restoration of the Habsburg Dynasty and the rearmament of Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria. Therefore, the steps taken by the leaders of the Home Guard today seem likely to provoke significant opposition from the Balkan Entente countries and the Little Entente countries. It is noted that the Austrian Air Force was eliminated in accordance with the Treaty of Saint-Germain, which prohibits Austria from manufacturing, importing, or exporting aircraft and aircraft parts. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) The Austrian Home Guard has recently formed several aviation units to strengthen Austria's air defense. Each province has organized an aviation unit, which is under the command of the Home Guard Military Bureau and led by Vice-Chancellor Starhemberg himself. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>Hitler Postpones Announcement of Political Views; Allowing Government Officials to Attend Piłsudski's Funeral in Poland</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The German Reichstag was originally scheduled to meet on Friday and it was expected that Hitler would attend the meeting to deliver an important speech. It has now been postponed to next Tuesday, to allow important government personnel to travel to Warsaw to participate in Marshal Piłsudski's funeral. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>

Accompanying him, in addition to two adjutants and the German Ambassador to Poland, will be one officer each from the German Air Force and Navy, as representatives of the Ministry of Defense. (Guomin Electric, 6th)</p>
<p>Stockholm. The special envoy of German Führer Hitler, Hess, delivered a speech at the Swedish-German Association here tonight. He began by saying that although the creators of National Socialism should not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, this revolution will eventually affect foreign countries. Hess then narrated the National Socialist movement, saying that National Socialism originated in the Great War and the post-war era. This new idea penetrated the hearts of front-line veterans. Hitler and his subordinates experienced the pain of war and deeply knew the cruelty of war, so we earnestly hope for peace. But we also know that peace is more hopeful if neighboring countries realize that attacking Germany is not as easy as turning one's hand. Hess also stated that Germany's new army is a necessary condition for Germany to strive for reconstruction and safeguard its security. Germany trusts the solemnity of international promises and firmly believes that the Fourteen Points of Wilson align with German ideals. However, no one is unaware of the achievements of disarmament. The unity of the Germans has now been achieved, and the enemies of National Socialism have no place to stand. However, Germany's religious disputes are still the target of their attacks. From the standpoint of National Socialism, the government will give the churches the rights they deserve, but the churches should also give the government the rights that belong to the government. No foreign propaganda can change this principle. (Guomin Electric, 15th)</p>

<h3>Mussolini's Speech on the Abyssinian Question; Dispatching Precautionary Measures to East Africa; No Country Has the Right to Intervene; Prepared for Any Eventuality in Europe</h3>
<p>(Rome) Prime Minister Mussolini delivered an important speech in the Senate today regarding the Abyssinian question, firmly denying the claim that England and France have made representations to Italy regarding the Abyssinian affair. Mussolini said, "So far, England and France have never made such representations. In view of the current relationship between England, France, and Italy, such representations are unlikely to occur in the future. The three countries can calmly and generously state their views to each other, without the need for diplomatic representations." Mussolini then sarcastically addressed those who generally worry about Italy's warmongering in East Africa, saying, "Today, people often think that the situation in Europe is unstable, and it is not appropriate for Italian troops to go abroad on a distant expedition. Those who say this are eloquent and have no selfish intentions. We are very grateful to hear it. However, we dare to answer that our intentions are exactly the same. The number of workers Italy sends to East Africa is greater than the number of soldiers. Why? It is also to seek peace in Europe. And I dare to make a clear and solemn declaration: We will continue to send all the soldiers we deem necessary. We are sending troops to East Africa as a precautionary measure. Whatever its nature, no one has the right to intervene. The East African problem is extremely difficult. No one but Italy can rashly judge it, because Italy has suffered bloody experience in East Africa and can never forget it. If the safety of our colonies is not guaranteed one day, if the life of even one Italian homeland soldier or civilian is threatened, then we would rather act rashly than be complacent. As for diplomacy, the past is well known to the world. We have not refused to hold negotiations with Abyssinia. The fact that we are prepared to appoint two members of the arbitration committee is sufficient to prove it. However, Abyssinia has launched a large-scale mobilization, preparing to attack. The Abyssinian authorities, especially the Abyssinian tribal chiefs, are opposed to any compromise with Italy. Therefore, it is Italy's responsibility to prevent Abyssinia from harboring delusions of trying to succeed. As for Europe, in the unfortunate event of a sudden disaster, I dare to declare that we have reservists of all levels from 1911, 1913, and 1914, and the reservists of the 1912 level who are preparing to enlist are not counted. We have 800,000 to 900,000 active soldiers, which should be more than sufficient to protect our country's security. These brave men have all received complete training and are strictly disciplined. As for military equipment, it is all the latest equipment. Our military industry has been working at full capacity for several months, so there is no fear of shortage. If something happens in Europe, our army, navy, and air force are prepared for any eventuality. However, in the political field, we are still willing to cooperate closely and concretely with all countries in Europe, large and small, near and far, in order to achieve stability and understanding among the countries. Otherwise, the modern world will continue to collapse. In short, we are doing our best to engage in military preparations, but the purpose is only to guarantee peace and not to threaten anyone." (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Rome) After Prime Minister Mussolini delivered an important speech in the Senate today regarding the Abyssinian question, Undersecretary for Colonial Affairs Lessona issued a declaration, stating, "The people of several tribes near Abyssinia have suffered after being conquered by Abyssinia. The practice of selling slaves has led to a sharp decline in population. The European powers have sat idly by, allowing Abyssinia to conquer the non-Abyssinian nations in the south and west, without intervening. They bear a great responsibility. If this continues, the colonies of European countries adjacent to Abyssinia will be permanently harmed. Now, only Italy has the responsibility to protect the various nations that have been trampled on by Abyssinia, because various international treaties in the past have recognized Italy's historical rights in East Africa." Lessona also said, "The Senate should be the backing of the Fascist government, fulfilling its mission in all aspects, and persisting to the end." (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Italy Appoints Arbitration Committee Members</h3>
<p>(Rome) Italy, according to the Italo-Abyssinian agreement of 1928, has appointed Ambassador Maloscutti and Counselor Montagna as representatives to the Arbitration Committee. This move is insufficient to indicate that this country's political attitude is more friendly than before. Political circles are very indignant after hearing that Abyssinia has again appealed to the League of Nations. The newspapers here believe that the Emperor's guarantee of not ordering mobilization and his recent statements are non-provocative in nature, aimed at confusing the public. They also claim that Abyssinia has released those arrested for attacking the Italian consulate in the Gonda region. (Guomin Electric, 14th)</p>
<h3>People's Hearts in Abyssinia Feel Uneasy</h3>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: Foreign residents here, seeing the increasing tension in the dispute with Italy, feel particularly uneasy. Most foreigners have already sent their families to Djibouti, and they themselves are also preparing to leave the capital. Officials believe the situation is very serious and that diplomatic relations with Italy may be severed at any time. (14th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>British Government Mediates</h3>
<p>(London) It is generally believed that the British Cabinet is currently exchanging opinions with France and Italy, seeking to ease the conflict between Italy and Abyssinia. The Italian Ambassador to the UK, Grandi, has met with Foreign Secretary Simon for discussions. The British side is striving to convene a mixed Italian-Abyssinian arbitration committee as soon as possible to resolve the conflict in the Walwal region on the Abyssinian border. (Note: In December of last year, a conflict occurred between Italian and Abyssinian troops in the Walwal region, and the Italian-Abyssinian dispute has become increasingly serious since then.) It is also possible that Britain will negotiate with the Abyssinian government, urging it to adopt a moderate attitude. (14th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>US Treasury Secretary's Declaration - Britain Takes a Reserved Attitude - Economic Nationalism is Strong - World Silver Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>(London) Since the declaration by US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau regarding monetary policy, British people have mostly adopted a reserved attitude. Treasury officials are currently studying the impact of this declaration on the London market, which can be summarized as follows: (1) Mr. Morgenthau mentioned the issue of international monetary stability, so the currencies of gold standard countries once tended to be strong. However, financial figures have never believed that the talk of stabilizing currencies is appropriate, so gold coins quickly fell back. (2) Generally, speculators previously feared that the United States would announce that future silver purchases would be limited to domestic production. Now, in Mr. Morgenthau's declaration, he has once again stated that he will continue to raise silver prices to improve the situation of silver standard countries. Therefore, speculators' concerns have been dispelled, and silver prices have risen sharply. Indian and Chinese speculators have taken a firm stance without hesitation. Some people believe that the purpose of the US silver policy may be to maintain the value of the US dollar so that it is lower than the British pound, so that the British people will have no fear and will consider a strategy for international monetary stability. (14th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) Wall Street criticized Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's broadcast speech last night as a petition to Britain and also a challenge, saying that the British pound is now an unknown quantity. Mr. Morgenthau explained that the United States can stabilize its currency value, but if the threat of other major commercial countries devaluing their currencies still exists, then the United States must always be prepared to devalue its currency again. It is still doubtful whether the Treasury Department is currently using the silver policy as a tool to attack the British monetary authorities. Mr. Morgenthau did not express any intention to change the silver policy, which caused world silver prices to rise. Wall Street believes that the world silver price rise caused by the US policy may eventually make it difficult for Britain because silver is related to the Rupee. Some people also pointed out that the Treasury Secretary's remarks are a declaration of even stronger economic nationalism, and it is questionable whether it can promote an agreement on international monetary stability. (14th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(New York) Local newspapers did not have a deep impression of Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's posture of international currency stabilization expressed in his broadcast speech on Monday night. Many criticisms point out that there are many omissions in his remarks regarding US monetary policy, such as the reasons for the US silver purchase policy were not mentioned, that being one example. The New York Times editorial stated that the government currently does not seem to maintain its attitude of refusing reconciliation in July 1933. The New York Commercial Daily editorial stated that if the United States maintains its policy of raising tariffs, demanding repayment of war debts, and opposing foreign loans, then the talk of currency stability when Britain has less gold reserves will hardly attract attention. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) France, as the leader in using the whole country, has always advocated currency stability, so it fully agrees with the remarks of US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau on Monday. French financial newspapers believe that Mr. Morgenthau's remarks are an unambiguous contribution to the gold standard countries, and believe that if the current turbulent situation still exists, then the responsibility should lie with Britain. French financial journalists generally said that the US Treasury Secretary's remarks contained an inquiry into whether Britain is willing to stabilize its currency. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>US Senator Suggests Cooperation with Britain to Stabilize Currency Values</h3>
<p>(Washington) Senator Thomas introduced a bill in the Senate today, requesting President Roosevelt to suggest to other countries whether joint action can be taken to maintain world currency stability. Mr. Thomas said that the use of gold and silver in a certain proportion as the standard gold should be considered, and as the standard of currency for several countries. We must first determine the US dollar before we can stabilize it. None of us believe that the US dollar has now reached the level where it should be stabilized. Other countries have the same view of their own currencies as we do. If the United States does not devalue its currency again first, then Britain may be the only country that can initiate the stabilization of currency values for other countries.

<h3>Mexico Orders Silver Coins from the United States</h3>

<h3>Reasons for the Depreciation of Brazilian Currency</h3>
<p>Brazilian Capital: According to officials from the Ministry of Finance who announced to the press, the continued depreciation of the Brazilian currency "Milreis" is very serious in nature, and the government has to immediately find ways to provide relief. The main reason for the depreciation of the Brazilian currency is that Brazil sold a large amount of cotton to Germany, raised the price, and paid for the goods in German Marks. However, because the German Mark has no market price in the international exchange market, this transaction affected the Brazilian currency, resulting in depreciation. The Ministry of Finance is now advocating that any currency of the importing country that does not have a fixed exchange rate in the international market should be prohibited from exporting Brazilian goods to that country.

<h3>Moscow - Subway Opens - Government Leaders Attend Ceremony</h3>

<h3>Philippine Referendum - Majority Supports New Constitution - Good Order, No Accidents - Philippine Authorities in the US are Pleased to Hear the News</h3>
<p>Manila: As of 8:30 this morning, part of the report on the voting of the people in the forty-nine provinces of the Philippines has shown that the vast majority support the new constitution and Philippine independence. The current vote count is as follows:</p>
<p>For: 828,699 votes</p>
<p>Against: 25,235 votes</p>
<p>According to this vote, it can be seen that the Filipinos have a completely consistent opinion on the issue of independence. Even in areas where non-Muslims live, such as the provinces of the Moro people, the majority also support the new constitution. Previously, there was a fear that disturbances might occur, but the voting situation in various places was very peaceful and orderly, so it can be known that this kind of fear was completely unfounded. (15th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) Officials in Washington today expressed satisfaction with the fact that the people of the Philippines voted in the majority in favor of the new constitution. When Philippine Senate Speaker Quezon, who is currently on his way back to the Philippines, received the telegram reporting the vote, he was also very pleased. An Associated Press reporter boarded the car and spoke with Mr. Quezon. Mr. Quezon said, "The fact that the people of the Philippines voted in favor of the new constitution and accepted independence by an unprecedented majority makes me very happy. From now on, no one will be able to say that we misunderstood the psychology of the people when we accepted the independence proposal." Philippine Governor-General Murphy was also very satisfied. He believed that the Filipinos' unanimous support for the new constitution meant that they also supported the implementation of all the provisions in the constitution. The only person in Congress who expressed dissatisfaction was Senator Keller. Mr. Keller was also a member of the delegation that recently went to the Philippines to investigate the country. He was quite surprised by the Filipinos' great support for the new constitution. He believed that the Filipinos are making a big mistake in demanding independence at the moment, because the Filipinos cannot build a navy and army, that is, they cannot break the conspiracy of other countries.

<h3>Zhu and Mao in a Dilemma; Chiang Arrives in Shanghai to Supervise the Suppression; the National Army's Momentum is Doubled; the Sichuan Bandits Cross the Fu River and Are Defeated by the 1st Route Army</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Hankou says that the remnants of Zhu and Mao, surrounded and suppressed by the National Army, fled from Guizhou into Yunnan, attempting to sneak across the Jinsha River and enter western Sichuan, in order to join forces with the remnants of Xu and Zhang. This plan was decided long ago, and this time it is particularly active, because when facing a life-or-death situation, they have no choice but to flee in all directions. However, the National Army has deployed carefully. Liu Wenhui's troops are guarding the Sichuan border, fortifying the walls and clearing the fields, using a well-rested army to resist bandits who are tired from fighting, so victory is assured. The Guizhou and Yunnan troops are following and pursuing, and will not allow them to cross the river calmly. They are now surrounded between Wuding, Yuanmou, and Yanxing, with no way to advance or retreat. After Commander Chiang arrived in Yunnan, the National Army's momentum was doubled. Many bandits have been killed in recent days, and the pontoon bridge across the river has also been bombed and destroyed. Just like Shi Dakai was annihilated in Sichuan because he could not cross the Jinsha River, the remnants of Zhu and Mao will also follow in his footsteps.</p>
<p>The bandit gangs of Xu Xiangqian and Zhang Guotao in Sichuan Province moved their main force across the right bank of the Fu River, attempting to advance from the Zhang'an-Mianluo area and attack [missing text]. However, the Niyou River is a natural barrier, and it is easy for our army to defend, and the bandits cannot escape. This kind of attempt is just a dream. Zhangming has now been recovered by our army, and the bandits have retreated to the Beichuan area. Deng Xihou's troops of our 1st Route Army have been fighting with the bandits, and have captured many. They are now launching a large-scale offensive. Sun Zhen's troops of the 2nd Route Army are also attacking the bandits from both sides in Xuanping, Leiguping, Chaping, Liangfeng'a, and other places, and have achieved an advantage. Deng Xihou, Commander-in-Chief of the 1st Route Army, and Ma Yuzhi, Acting Commander of the 28th Army, both telegraphed the victory. (14th)</p>
<h3>After Zhu Zhuowen Was Killed; Zhu Was Executed by Firing Squad the Same Night He Was Arrested; Authorities Say Zhu Planned to Disrupt Guangdong</h3>
<p>Guangzhou dispatch, Zhu Zhuowen, a veteran member of the Kuomintang, was arrested in Zhongshan County on the afternoon of the 6th by Liang Gongfu's regiment of the garrison troops. Liang immediately telegraphed the province to report to Chen Jitang and asked for instructions. Chen immediately ordered him to be executed on the spot. That night, Liang executed Zhu by firing squad behind the regiment headquarters. It is inaccurate to say that Zhu was executed on the day after his arrest. Also, Zhu was very calm when he was arrested. Only Yang Tongsun, director of the Public Security Branch Bureau of the First District, pointed out that Zhu falsely claimed to go to the toilet and escaped through the back door. According to people in Zhongshan County, this is not credible either. The following is the report submitted by the bureau chief to the county government for review after Liang Gongfu's letter requesting the collection of Zhu's body: "Report on reporting matters. At 7:00 AM today, the 8th, a letter was received from Liang Gongfu, commander of the 2nd Regiment of the 1st Training Division of the National Revolutionary Army, stating that there is a prisoner in our regiment named Zhu Zhuowen. Last night, at deep night, he falsely claimed to go to the toilet. When the guard escorted him out the back door, he suddenly pushed the guard down and ran wildly desperately. At that time, the guard was unable to stop him, so he fired a warning shot. The escaped prisoner Zhu Zhuowen was shot and killed. It is appropriate to inform your bureau chief to investigate and employ a undertaker to prepare a coffin and bury the prisoner's body to avoid exposure, which is harmful to hygiene, etc. Approved accordingly, hereby report to the county government for inspection, respectfully submitted, Yang Tongsun, Director of the First District Branch Bureau." After Zhu was executed, his family heard the news, and his nephew Zhu Jianxiong and son-in-law Li Jinan requested the First District Public Security Branch Bureau to claim the body for burial. The branch bureau approved the request. The bureau chief then continued to report to the county government, stating, "Report on reporting matters. According to the letter from the 2nd Regiment of the 1st Training Division requesting that the body of the escaped prisoner Zhu Zhuowen be buried by a undertaker, it has been reported to your government for inspection. Later, Zhu Zhuowen's nephew Zhu Jianxiong came to the bureau to request to claim Zhu Zhuowen's body for burial. He was ordered to present a receipt, and Zhu Jianxiong was allowed to take Zhu Zhuowen's body for burial. In addition to replying to the 2nd Regiment for investigation, this is prepared and reported to your government for inspection, respectfully submitted, Yang Tongsun, Director of the First District Public Security Bureau." On the morning of the 8th, Zhu's son-in-law Li Jinan brought Zhu's body back to his native Xiya Township in the Fourth District. He arrived that evening. According to township rules, those who die outside the township cannot enter the township after their coffin is returned, so Zhu's body was stopped in the rain shelter outside the township for the funeral. Moreover, the rain shelter was built there by Zhu when he was the Director of the Construction Bureau to facilitate the waiting and sheltering of villagers. It was unexpected that it would be the place for his burial.</p>
<p>Chen Jitang sent He Luo, director of the Provincial Public Security Bureau, to Zhongshan County to preside over the Zhu case, so He knew more about the truth of this case. The reporter went to the Public Security Bureau to visit He and inquire about everything. He was busy with other matters, so Luo Mingluan, director of the Police Review Office, was appointed to meet. He replied as follows: "Zhu Zhuowen, as a veteran comrade of our party, actually did such an illegal thing, which led to such a result. It is very regrettable. Zhu gathered leaders of Hongbang bandits and ruffians from various provinces along the Yangtze River, as well as bandits and ruffians from Guangdong Province, and used certain places as strongholds. He smuggled arms into the country, plotted to disrupt Guangdong's security. The authorities found conclusive evidence that his crime was unforgivable. As for whether there was a political background, it is not known. However, when Zhu was in custody, he intended to escape, and the guards fired and killed him on the spot," he said.</p>
<p>Since Zhu had died, a detailed account of his life is recorded below. Zhu was from Xiya Township in the Fourth District of Zhongshan County. His father, Yongkang, was wealthy, well-educated, and proficient in medicine. In the past, Xiya was not as convenient in transportation as it is today, so people were more simple and often prone to bravery. Yongkang set up a private school at home, thinking of changing this. Zhu had two brothers. The elder brother died early, he was in the middle, and his younger brother Jingnu was good at fighting injustice, so the villagers avoided those who did not follow the rules. His strong personality did not give way to his elder brother, but when he met Zhu Zhuowen, he became silent. Because Zhu spent his childhood in the countryside, he often herded cows and played with stones, and his command was like someone who knew military affairs. When he entered school, he was very diligent in his studies, and his father valued him very much. He often made him practice martial arts to strengthen his body and mind. His father, Yongkang, was not a pedantic Confucian scholar who adhered to the old ways. During banquets, he often showed him the social situation, the national situation, and the methods of medicine. Zhu received this family education, and revolutionary ideas naturally emerged. After he came of age, he went to the United States, saw the construction of foreigners and the facilities of society, and was dissatisfied with the Qing government, which was often seen in his words and expressions. So he secretly studied politics and military affairs, and especially loved flying. In the United States and Japan, he followed President Sun for twenty years. After returning to China, he devoted himself to the revolution and made many contributions. He served as the director of the Guangdong Arsenal and the director of the Aviation Bureau, and twice as the county magistrate of Zhongshan County and the commander-in-chief of the Central Government's Direct Jurisdiction for Suppressing Bandits. He made special contributions to the construction of Zhongshan. The Kangzhuang Avenue in Shiqi is now built by Zhu at that time. He hated people's superstition of ghosts and gods most in his life. When he was in charge of the county government, he destroyed idols twice and shattered the dreams of ignorant men and women. After the Liao case occurred, Zhu was wanted. For several years, he relied on repairing old machines, chemical technology, and planting fruits and vegetables to support himself. Last year, Magistrate Tang left office, and Liang Hongguang took over. As soon as he got off the car, he appointed him as the Director of the Construction Bureau and the Director of the Land Bureau. When Magistrate Yang took office, he changed him to the Chief of the Construction and Land Section, and he resigned. The villagers thought that he was old and should recuperate in Linquan, but unexpectedly he still died unexpectedly. Many people said that it was a pity that he could not finish well. Zhu is now over sixty years old and has two daughters. One daughter, Mofei, is bold and has a masculine spirit, proficient in aviation, and is one of the few female aviators in the country. Unfortunately, she died early. The second daughter, Moying, married Li Jinan of Dahuan. The youngest son is now seventeen years old and is studying at Zhongda University in Guangzhou. Zhu's wife passed away years ago, and he remarried last year. Zhu was very honest in his life, so the legacy after his death was very small.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Criminal Confession of False Theft Presented to the Ministry, Appealing for Injustice</h3>
<p>Recently, four theft cases have occurred in Dongfang Township in succession, but none have been solved. Shangguan Ying, the patrol officer of the Sixth Sub-station of the Public Security Bureau, and Chen, the leader of the Water Police Division, arrested Mao Kunrong, Song Sandi, Xu Xingyin, Guo Shugen, Xu Han, and other five people a few days ago, pointed them out as thieves, and forced them to confess by torture. After being sent to the local procuratorate, all of them retracted their confessions and confessed that Patrol Officer Shangguan Ying used torture and coercion. Prosecutor Lü ordered the officials to verify that Mao Kunrong and others had indeed been injured by torture, and immediately ordered them to be detained, considering the seriousness of the case, pending investigation. Mao Kunrong's father, Mao Xushan, and his daughter-in-law Mao Niu, took a train to Beijing yesterday (the 15th) to appeal for injustice to the Ministry of Judicial Administration. Xu Xingyin's wife, Ms. Xu, has been thinking of ending her life since her husband was arrested and once tried to hang herself from the beams. People discovered her and rescued her, so she was able to live. The court is paying close attention to this case, and it is now under strict investigation.</p>

<p>The Second Platoon of the Seventh Water Police Unit stationed in Hengta, Wujiang arrested Wang Shengyou, a notorious bandit who had been active in Taihu Lake for many years and committed numerous crimes, along with his accomplice Wang Guanglun, in the town on the 14th.

<h3>Wuxi: Adding Gravel to the Wuxi-Shanghai Highway</h3>
<p>Since the Jiangsu Construction Bureau supervised and constructed the Wuxi-Shanghai Highway in sections, the bridge and culvert projects along the trestle have already been completed. Currently, they are actively paving the gravel road surface. The roadbed in the Wuxi section is nine meters wide, and the road surface is three meters wide, from Zhoushanbang to Yangjian. All the materials used have been transported to Wuxi and workers have been ordered to add mud slurry. If there is no rain, it can be completed by the end of June. The remaining sections of the work are roughly the same. It is reported that after the road is completed, it is planned to set up a main station in Shanghai, which will begin construction within a few days, and branch stations will be set up in various cities and towns along the Shanghai-Wuxi route. The formal opening of the road is expected to be realized in mid-next month. At the same time, the Construction Bureau believes that the section of the Suzhou-Wuxi road from Guangfu via Wangting to Wuxi urgently needs to be built, and has ordered the Wuxian and Wuxi county governments to include the project in the construction plan for the 24th year and to report the progress within ten days of receiving the document.</p>
<h3>Land Survey to be Completed Next Month</h3>
<p>Before the establishment of the local county land bureau, there was a land survey team responsible for handling the land survey work of the whole county. Later, due to changes in the provincial land survey plan and the adoption of aerial surveying, the scope of the land survey team was reduced and changed to a land survey group, with one group leader in charge. The land survey work in the third district will be completed soon, so the provincial bureau has set a deadline for completion by the end of June. The remaining uncompleted registration work will be continued by the land bureau. The aerial photography has already been completed, and the mapping team also started working last month. As for the land price declaration, all 35 towns and villages in the first district have been announced, and certificates have also been issued. The eight towns in the central district, and the remaining 27 towns outside the city, will also be started in order. As for the registration of other rights (that is, the title deeds of households that have been mortgaged to others), as of yesterday, more than 1,000 households have been registered. Those whose title deeds have not been mortgaged to others must also register with the land bureau and obtain a certificate. In the future, the bureau will register each household and send it to the field tax office to collect land value tax by the mu. Land in rural areas must also be registered as soon as the land survey is completed.</p>
<h3>"Poison Pill King" Wang Guiqing Escorted to the Province</h3>
<p>The famous "Poison Pill King," Wang Guiqing from Anhui, was arrested in Shanghai and escorted to Wuxi. Subsequently, an accomplice, Su Guoliang (i.e., Su Lanxi), was also arrested and sent to the county government for detention. Meanwhile, the Public Security Bureau was ordered to strictly arrest the remaining accomplices. Yesterday (the 15th), Section Chief Yu again brought the two criminals, Wang and Su, forward and handed them over to the Public Security Bureau. Squad Leader Xiao Tongsheng of the patrol team led four police officers and escorted them to the Zhenjiang Garrison Headquarters for interrogation at around 6 a.m. When Wang was at the Public Security Bureau, he deeply regretted that he had not surrendered himself earlier, which had implicated Hu and Hu Qiu and others who were imprisoned.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Public Security Bureau Cracks Down on Trafficking of Poison Pills</h3>
<p>Magistrate Hou of Wuyi County received a provincial order to investigate and arrest Qian Yinsheng outside the East Gate for trafficking in poison pills. He immediately secretly ordered Xu Shiguang, the director of the Public Security Bureau, to investigate and arrest him at his address. On the morning of the 14th, Director Xu ordered service personnel of the Supervision Section, Chong Lun, etc., to lead a team of more than ten soldiers to search Qian Yinsheng's house in Yanjiazhuang, Longyou Township, outside the East Gate. First, Qian Yinsheng was arrested, and 25 cans of poison pills were found in the attic. Another 25 cans were found in the urn in Zhou Gu's bedroom in the parlor, including seven cans with broken paper packages, wrapped into a large package, weighing four catties, about 42,000 pills. Qian Yinsheng, his wife Gu, and Zhou Gu were all taken to the bureau. That night, the people and thieves were transferred to the County Anti-Smoking Association for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Assault Case in the Third District</h3>
<p>At Xu Xinghao's house in Fenghuang Township, the third district of Wuyi, more than a dozen bandits suddenly came at midnight on the 13th, breaking the door with weapons. Xu Ziding resisted the bandits, resulting in him being shot by a rain gun and seriously injured. Hao Xing took the opportunity to escape. His younger brother Yinhao was grabbed by the bandits, tied with ropes, and burned, causing burns in many places. They searched for a long time and plundered before leaving.</p>
<h3>Haimen: Falsely Accusing a Good Woman of Being a Prostitute Leads to a Strike</h3>
<p>In Sanyang Town, the fourth district, merchants Zhou Zhiqin, Zhou Zhi, Luo Erlang, Qin Kechang, etc., were gambling at Guo Zhou's house in the West Market of the town on the afternoon of the 12th. Yin Xinbo, the director of the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau, learned of this and led police to arrest Zhou Zhiqin and others. He also accused Guo Zhou's daughter, Guiying (age 13, a fifth-grade student at Sanyang Town Primary School), of being a private prostitute and took her to the bureau for detention. Subsequently, Yang Pei, the principal of Sanyang Town Primary School, went to prove her innocence and requested that Guiying be released. Yin refused, arousing public anger. Stores in the town went on strike yesterday (the 13th), and telegraphed the county government to dismiss and severely punish Director Yin. The county government sent staff members Chen Jinxian and Zhang Guozhen, together with Dai Hongtao, the director of the County Public Security Bureau, to release the arrested Zhou Zhiqin and Guo Guiying. Director Yin was dismissed and investigated, and his vacancy was temporarily filled by Zhou Mingyi, a patrol officer from the Third Resident Office of the Public Security Bureau. All the merchants were satisfied, and business was resumed today (the 14th).</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Major Fire in Xiaomen Huangni Mountain</h3>
<p>At about 10 p.m. on the 14th, a straw shed in the backyard of Zhang Baogen's pig business in Huangni Mountain, Tuobanqiao, suddenly caught fire due to carelessness. At that time, the north wind was strong, and the straw sheds were all connected. The fire spread south, and Huangni Mountain became a mountain of flames in an instant. Fire brigades from all sections rushed to the scene and tried their best to put out the fire. However, due to the lack of water sources in the area, and the Tongjiang Canal was blocked and dried up due to dredging work, except for one or two wells, water had to be fetched from Lotus Pond by the Jiangbian River, which was about a mile away from the fire. Therefore, the fire spread even more rapidly. The burned area stretched from Yufukou in the north and Huangni Mountain to Yiren Lane in Xiaomenkou in the south, from the east and west city walls in the east to Tuobanqiao in the west, with a circumference of nearly a mile. More than 100 shanties and more than a dozen tile houses were burned down, which was a major fire rarely seen in the provincial capital in recent years.</p>
<h3>Pinghu: Hoodlums in Dushan Rob a Car</h3>
<p>Near Dushan, Zhapu, in the afternoon of the previous day, two British members of Shanghai's International Chamber of Commerce, accompanied by two Western women, came to visit in a car with Shanghai license number 7167. That night, they put up a cloth shed and camped outside the car on the beach road. Unexpectedly, at about midnight, three or four hoodlums wearing short clothes and speaking in a Dongxiang accent rushed into the car and robbed all the valuables in the car. The car license was also taken away. Before leaving, they tried to destroy the machinery, but accidentally touched the power, and the horn sounded loudly. The Westerners heard the sound and rushed over. It seemed that three or four figures flew away. After reporting to the police, the branch director immediately led all the police officers and armed men to arrest them. Yesterday, five suspects, Guo Wenchang, Li A'chang, Li A'da, Li A'xiang, and Li A'shun, were arrested and sent to the county for investigation today.</p>

<h3>Bright Future for National Goods; People of Yunnan and Gansu Love to Use National Goods; Contacting Merchant Guilds to Promote Sales in the Interior</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, after the promotion of national goods by the people, it has been developing day by day. Since the implementation of acceptance bills, the settlement of goods has become more convenient. Merchants in this industry have now contacted various merchant guilds to promote sales in the interior. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance has also decided to abolish the transit tax to promote it. Therefore, the national goods industry has a bright future. The reporter of the Central News Agency, in order to understand the recent development of the industry, specially inquired from people in the industry and recorded the information obtained as follows.</p>
<p>Pay Attention to Promotion</p>
<p>According to Pan Yangyao of the Four Lines Preparation Bank, which specializes in investigating local industry and commerce, the call for promoting national goods has been around for a long time. There are many reasons why it cannot be developed immediately, and the most important reason is that national goods manufacturers do not pay attention to sales channels. In the past, manufacturers in this industry devoted all their efforts to the production of goods, but did not pay attention to the sales channels after the production of goods, resulting in stagnant sales, accumulated inventory, and unprofitable losses. Now they have realized the previous mistakes, and in addition to paying attention to the products, they are also devoting all their efforts to contacting merchant guilds in various places, so that the goods can be distributed to various places.</p>
<p>Yunnan and Gansu are Happy to Use</p>
<p>Since the implementation of acceptance bills for national goods, sales have increased even more. This is because acceptance bills are beneficial to manufacturers and merchants. Recently, after the National Goods Exhibition went to Yunnan, it was very popular among the people there. The first batch of national goods shipped there was sold out. National goods manufacturers have now established a national goods company in Kunming to actively promote sales. In the northwest, Xu Xianshi, the director of the Gansu Construction Department, came to Shanghai a few days ago and discussed with various national goods manufacturers in this city to establish national goods companies in the important cities of the province, because the people there are enthusiastic about purchasing national goods, which is very strong.</p>
<p>Bright Future</p>
<p>National goods manufacturers have expressed their joy after learning that the Ministry of Finance has decided to implement the abolition of the transit tax. After the abolition of the transit tax, the transportation and sales of national goods to various places will inevitably develop further. People in the industry also hope that the government will pay attention to the import of foreign goods that are related to the development of national goods in the future.</p>
<p>Eliminate Inferiority</p>
<p>The reporter then went to the national goods industry to inquire. It is an important task for the people to purchase national goods today. However, the rich children in Shanghai and the so-called modern girls all take pride in purchasing foreign goods. This kind of inferiority complex and misunderstanding is enough to ruin the country. Therefore, it is deeply hoped that these ladies and gentlemen will immediately eliminate this misunderstanding and purchase national goods. Moreover, national goods are not only cheaper in price, but also superior in quality to imported goods. In view of the fact that people in Yunnan, Gansu, and other provinces are happy to use national goods, they must be touched by it.</p>
<h3>Closing of the Spring Plowing Movement; 50,000 Farmers Participated in the Tour of 17 Districts</h3>
<p>According to the Dazhong News Agency, in order to instill knowledge in farmers and improve the technology of sowing, seed selection, and fertilization in various agricultural operations, the Social Affairs Bureau, together with the Municipal Party Department, the Municipal Farmers' Association, and the Agricultural Experiment Station, held an expanded spring plowing movement, organized a propaganda team, and took turns going to Wusong, Jiangwan, Zhabei, Yinheng, Yinxiang, Pusong, Pudong, Yangsi, Gaoxing, Gaoqiao, Longhua, Fahua, Lihang and other 17 districts to give lectures to farmers. It closed the day before yesterday. In this spring plowing movement, a total of more than 50,000 farmers from various districts participated in the lectures. Propaganda and exhibitions were carried out at the same time, which was quite effective. The Social Affairs Bureau plans to conduct large-scale propaganda again at this time next year, so that the farmers in Shanghai will be models for China.</p>
<h3>After Finance Minister Kong Reported on Future Tasks, All Industries Hope for Gradual Implementation; Promoting Exports is a Fundamental Measure</h3>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from industry and commerce yesterday that Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi's various items in the summary of the financial report for the fiscal years of the Republic of China 21 and 22, such as reorganizing the customs tariff, striving to increase tax revenue without affecting industrial products and the daily necessities of the general public, reducing or exempting export taxes on special export products within the possible scope to encourage them, stabilizing currency, and unifying auxiliary coins to eliminate obstacles to industry and commerce, improving transportation, especially developing railways and highways, providing relief to the fundamental agriculture in the country and seeking the development of the rural economy, and encouraging and controlling important domestic industries such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and raw silk, are all hoped to be implemented gradually by all industries, and they are all willing to cooperate with the government. Moreover, the above items are fundamental measures.</p>
<h3>Postal Savings and Remittances Administration; Measures for Agricultural Loans; Acting as an Agent for the Transportation of Agricultural Products and Accepting Exchange</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Postal Savings and Remittances Administration has formulated various regulations and measures for agricultural loans and agricultural product exchange businesses after careful planning, and has submitted them to the Ministry of Communications for approval, which will be implemented soon. Now, the key points of the loan, the simple regulations of the loan office, and the methods for handling the exchange are found, and according to Wang Zhijing, the secretary of the bureau, after inspecting various places, the office will be set up to carry out various businesses. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Reasons for Holding</p>
<p>The reasons for the Postal Savings and Remittances Administration to hold agricultural loans and other businesses are: Although the agricultural loans of this bureau were indirectly held last year with the Jiangsu Farmers Bank with a certain amount of loans, the direct holding of the above loans has not yet been planned. It is found that most of the depositors of this bureau are savings below 500 yuan, and the savings of farmers, workers, and small citizens account for one-third of the total savings. It is quite appropriate to use this kind of funds from the bottom of the people in the rural areas related to the national economy, and the business scope of this bureau is also stipulated by the Legislative Yuan, with a special clause for agricultural loans. Agricultural loans, from the standpoint of the national economy, are indeed a good way to relieve the decline of the rural areas. From the standpoint of investment, agricultural loans are also a kind of physical storage, which is in line with the purpose of prudent use of savings in this bureau. Therefore, in principle and investment policy, it is an inevitable and urgent move to hold agricultural loans. Furthermore, this bureau, with its vast organization and strong credit, penetrates into the people. On the one hand, it uses the vast organization as the basis for agricultural loans, and on the other hand, it relies on strong credit to seek the development of local investment while promoting savings. The measures are easy and the effect is doubled. Therefore, in terms of organizational use, it is also the most economical and effective business for this bureau to hold agricultural loans.</p>
<p>Send Personnel to Investigate</p>
<p>As for the above-mentioned loans, what should be paid attention to, in short, there are three points: 1. The shape of the local economy and transportation, and the period of production and sales, the amount of production and sales, etc., should all be fully understood. Therefore, a detailed investigation must be carried out in advance as a preparation. 2. There must be warehouse facilities, which are the basic requirements for agricultural loans. 3. The core of agricultural loans must be grasped. The loans should be limited to direct producers of agricultural products and those who have a direct relationship with farmers, so as to avoid being confused by those who hoard and speculate for profit. These three points should be studied at the beginning of business preparation, and they are also closely related to the entire agricultural loan policy. Therefore, at the beginning of the business, the bureau decided to conduct a trial in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui first, and then promote it to the whole country. Wang Zhijing, the secretary of the bureau, will be sent to various places to conduct detailed investigations, and then set up offices and start the business. The loan regulations and methods are also strict, in order to prevent abuses and affect the progress of the business.</p>
<p>Loan Regulations</p>
<p>Simple regulations for agricultural loans at the Postal Savings and Remittances Administration Loan Office: 1. In order to adjust the rural economy and eliminate the cheap sales and expensive purchases of farmers, this bureau operates agricultural storage and loan business. 1.

<h3>The Guangdong Inspection Group Left Hangzhou Yesterday and Returned to Shanghai; The Impression of Inspecting Hangzhou and Other Places Was Very Good; They Will Go to Suzhou, Wuxi and Other Places Tonight and Then Go North</h3>
<p>The Guangdong Provincial Government Inspection Group, including Li Gezhi, Li Yupei, Zhong Shenglin, and other 11 people, came to Shanghai on the 2nd of this month and have completed the inspection in Shanghai. The group continued to Hangzhou for inspection on the 9th according to the scheduled itinerary. Now that the matter is over, they returned to Shanghai yesterday and decided to take the Beijing-Shanghai Train tonight to Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Nanjing and other places for inspection. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Inspection Process: The group departed from Shanghai to Hangzhou on the afternoon of the 9th and inspected Hangzhou for four days, and transferred to Lanxi Jinhua for inspection for two days. After returning to Hangzhou from Jinhua the day before yesterday, they took the 7:45 a.m. Zhajing train from Hangzhou to Shanghai yesterday morning, and arrived at the port at 12:30 p.m. yesterday. According to Li Getian, a member of the group, who told the reporter of the Industrial Society, the group began inspection in Hangzhou on the 10th, and the process was: the first day was the People's Education Experiment School, the People's Education Hall, the Gushan Library, the Zoo, the Museum, Zhejiang University, the Provincial Government and various departments, the second day was the Water Conservancy Bureau, the Police Academy, the Zhenchang Silk Factory, the Dalai Iron Factory, the Telephone Bureau, the Cotton Improvement Field, the Silk Control Committee, the third day was to visit scenic spots, and the fourth day was to go to Lanxi to inspect the county government and various schools, and the fifth day was to go to Jinhua to inspect Zhejiang Provincial No. 7 Middle School.</p>

In terms of construction, the achievements in highways have also made considerable progress, and the educational facilities are even better. The academic atmosphere is very pure and the results are also excellent. Students can truly study knowledge, and the perfect equipment is a trivial matter.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Province: Sugar Industry Loan Established, Approximately 200,000 Yuan Handled by Shanghai Bank; Water Conservancy Loan Difficult to Succeed in the Short Term</h3>
<p>According to the *Shen Shi News Agency*, Feng Rui, Director of the Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, came to Shanghai from Guangdong a few days ago to negotiate with banking circles in Shanghai for investment in Guangdong, development of the sugar industry, and the establishment of a Guangdong Provincial Water Conservancy and Land Reclamation Company. In recent days, he has been visiting the China, Shanghai, Communications, and Central Banks separately to carry out negotiations. According to banking circles yesterday, regarding the Guangdong sugar industry loan, the China and Shanghai Second Branch had already discussed the principles in Guangdong. Therefore, during Feng's visit to Shanghai this time, he negotiated with Chen Guangfu, General Manager of the Shanghai Bank, on the previous two days, and the negotiations have been successful. The loan amount is 200,000 yuan, which will be borrowed by Shanghai Bank alone. The contract signing procedures have been completed. As for the 3 million yuan loan for the water conservancy and land reclamation company, Feng has also contacted various banks, but there are no concrete results yet, so it will be difficult to sign an agreement in the short term.</p>
<h3>Netherlands East Indies: Treatment of Overseas Chinese, Oppressive Regulations, Perilous Situation; Foreign Ministry Has Telegraphed Envoy for Negotiations</h3>
<p>According to the *Central News Agency*, overseas Chinese compatriots have been subjected to ill-treatment and oppression by local authorities in recent years. Mexico was the first, followed by Siam. Recently, there have been anti-Chinese incidents in the Netherlands East Indies, which have attracted widespread attention. Active discussions are underway to find solutions to ensure the safety of the lives and property of overseas Chinese compatriots. To understand the situation of anti-Chinese sentiment in the Netherlands East Indies, the *Central News Agency* reporter specifically visited the authorities of the Overseas Chinese Federation. The answers are as follows:</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>Overseas Chinese Situation: The number of overseas Chinese residing in the Netherlands East Indies totals more than 3.6 million, which is more than the local indigenous people. They are mostly scattered in Sumatra, Java, Sambelong, Batavia, Surabaya, Solo, and other places. Most of them are engaged in mining, planting, industry, and commerce. Many have established families through diligence and thrift. Due to the long history, they have great influence locally and hold important economic power. However, the situation is deteriorating year by year. The reason is nothing more than being heavily oppressed by the local authorities and lacking the power to protect themselves. Therefore, the method of protecting overseas Chinese compatriots should be to carry out negotiations on the one hand and to strengthen the power of overseas Chinese compatriots on the other hand. Only in this way can it be effective.</p>
<p>Harsh Taxes: The Netherlands East Indies authorities' treatment of overseas Chinese compatriots cannot be fully described in a few words. Taking the import tax levied on overseas Chinese entering the country as an example, in the past, every overseas Chinese person entering the country had to pay an import tax of 25 guilders, which was then increased to 50 guilders, 100 guilders, and now it has risen to 150 guilders. Not only that, but they must also find two solid shops as guarantors. Moreover, Chinese entering the country must have a legitimate occupation before they are allowed to land, so as to restrict them. As for overseas Chinese who are allowed to land, the authorities issue a temporary residence permit that allows them to live for six months. During these six months, if no misconduct occurs, they can request a permanent residence permit. If there is misconduct, they will be deported. If a permanent residence permit has been obtained, if there is misconduct, they will also be deported, and the import tax will not be refunded. In addition to import tax, an income tax is also levied, which is a poll tax. The tax rate, regardless of whether it is an employee or an employer, is 15% of the income. Commercial firms, regardless of profit or loss, must pay a large amount of income tax in accordance with the regulations. The person in charge is a Kapitan, who is appointed by the local authorities from among the overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Restrictions on Education: As for the situation of overseas Chinese education in the area, it is fairly developed, but only Chinese middle schools can be established, and they are also heavily restricted by the authorities. There is also a Chinese Affairs Department that specializes in this matter. The department sends people to various schools from time to time to investigate textbooks and all school affairs. If they deem a certain textbook inappropriate, they will prohibit it. If there is the slightest argument, a strict order for disposal is issued, or even schools are closed and principals and teachers are expelled. As for politics, although Chinese can nominally serve as members of parliament, they are not elected by the Chinese people but are appointed by the authorities.</p>
<p>Envoy's Negotiations: Furthermore, according to the *Ta Kung Pao*, regarding the case of ill-treatment of overseas Chinese in the Netherlands East Indies, it was learned from diplomatic sources yesterday that after receiving reports from all parties, the government has telegraphed Jin Wensi, our country's envoy to the Netherlands, to seriously negotiate directly with the Dutch foreign authorities. It is likely that an inquiry approach will be taken first, with oral negotiations with the Dutch authorities. If necessary, a formal note will be sent to the country's foreign ministry with a serious protest. The Foreign Ministry is very concerned about this matter. It was originally planned to inquire from the Dutch embassy in Peiping, but since the Dutch envoy Du Peike has returned to his country, Jin was specifically telegraphed to negotiate in Europe.</p>
<h3>Ten Talks by Schmid-Burgk: The Origin of Asian Peoples</h3>
<p>According to the *North China Daily News*, Professor Schmid-Burgk of the University of Vienna arrived in Shanghai on the President Grant on Tuesday. The doctor is an authority on anthropology and advocates the cultural-historical school of anthropology (as opposed to the evolutionary school). He has also written many famous works on comparative studies of primitive religion and religious psychology. The doctor stayed in Shanghai for one day and then planned to go north to Peiping to give several lectures at Peking University. He is scheduled to return to Shanghai in October and go to Manila and other southern places to continue lecturing. It is now believed that when he arrives in Shanghai for the second time, people in Shanghai will invite him to give several lectures. The doctor's book "The Origin of the Concept of God", written in German, consists of six volumes and is probably the most perfect work on religious studies. It has been abridged and translated into English. Other works are also required reading for the study of anthropology. A representative of the *North China Daily News* asked about the common ancestors and origins of Asian peoples. The doctor replied that to answer this question, it would be necessary to write a book. To answer briefly, Asia is the origin of human progress. "Peking Man" is the representative of today's inhabitants. There is no doubt that Chinese, Japanese, American Indians, and Eskimos all have the same origin. The legends of creation, which are popular in the northern and central regions, are completely the same from the Atlantic Ocean (America), northern Asia, Russia, and including central Europe. The representative asked whether the inhabitants of the equatorial region also believe in this theory. The doctor replied that the legends of the Simian Pagetts are also close to it. The doctor finally said that in his opinion, most American anthropologists, with a few exceptions, also belong to the cultural-historical school.</p>
<h3>Marine Engineers Push Representatives Yesterday to Petition Yu Feipeng, Requesting Eight Points to Relieve Unemployment; Yu Agrees to Return to Beijing for Detailed Discussion</h3>
<p>According to the *New Sound News Agency*, the Chinese Marine Engineers' Association, due to the large number of unemployed members, specially sent representatives to the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Communications Yu Feipeng yesterday afternoon to petition for relief. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Representatives Petition: At 2:00 p.m. yesterday, the association specially sent representatives Feng Wangming, Zhang Zhuxuan, Cai Yu, Mao Jinsheng, Shen Yaosheng, and more than 100 representatives of unemployed members to petition Yu Feipeng, requesting: (1) Please quickly issue a ministerial order to all competent maritime administrative organs that from the date of the order, no one without a seafarer's certificate will be allowed to be employed to perform duties. Those who are already on board and whose employment began before the date of the ministerial order, and who have previously applied for employment registration to the maritime administration and obtained a seaman's handbook stating the facts and providing documentary evidence, will be temporarily allowed to serve, but the shipping company will be responsible for notifying them to apply for examination within one month, or at least once when their service vessel arrives at the port of Shanghai. Those who exceed the time limit will be ordered to resign. (2) Seafarers applying for examination must submit their applications for examination within one month, or at least twice when their service vessel arrives at the port of Shanghai, after receiving an approved order from the Ministry to go to the Ministry for examination. Those who evade or fail to complete the examination will be dealt with and will not be allowed to serve. (3) Seafarers who are engaged in examination are allowed to find qualified personnel to act as their agents for the vacant positions and are allowed to retain their original positions. Those who pass the examination and are able to receive certificates equivalent to their original positions are guaranteed reinstatement, and the shipping company shall not refuse. (4) Current seafarers who fail the examination and are issued lower-level certificates are not allowed to serve at a higher level. (5) Those who serve beyond two levels will be ordered to stop working. The qualifications they have already served will only be calculated according to the level of the certificate they hold. (6) Seafarers applying for examination may take written tests if they are able. The examination subjects will not be divided into A and B, and they may choose freely. Since the examination has already been taken, the results should be used to determine the level, and there should be no prior prejudice to base the level on the standard of merchant marine schools. The navigation profession is shared by all seafarers and cannot be monopolized by one faction. Therefore, the regulation that those who are not graduates of merchant marine schools shall not be issued Class A certificates must be abolished in order to show fairness. (7) The Shanghai Maritime Administration handles seafarer registration improperly, and there are complaints from the outside world, and there are facts to check. For example, the chief engineer is employed without a certificate, impersonating another person, or without applying for examination. The statutory qualifications are mostly inconsistent, but the bureau does not pay attention to it. It is unknown why this is the case. Therefore, as a thorough solution, all engine seafarers in Shanghai, including employment, dismissal, and changing service vessels, will be the responsibility of the affiliated association for transfer applications in order to supervise each other and provide relief. (8) The provisions of Articles 8 and 9 of the Implementation Rules of the Provisional Regulations for Seafarer Examination shall be amended. It is stipulated that chief engineers with certificates shall not be exempted from examination unless they have continuously served for more than five years. Other engine seafarers shall not be allowed to take the original level examination unless they have held the position specified on the certificate for more than one year. At present, foreign seafarers and illegal Chinese seafarers have not been banned and are still able to serve, clearly infringing on the rights of seafarers who have already obtained certificates. The government not only fails to protect them but also imposes harsh restrictions on them. Therefore, considering the unemployed seafarers, they have already felt the pain of life, and even after several years, even if they do not fill the ravines or die of hunger and cold, their original qualifications will have long been destroyed and they will no longer have the opportunity to work as seafarers. This is a suicidal policy and should be abolished. Yu agreed to discuss each point of the representatives' requests with Minister Zhu after returning to Beijing and try to deal with them within a possible scope. The seafarers considered the results satisfactory and dispersed. In addition, the general election meeting, which was originally scheduled to be held yesterday, was postponed to the afternoon of the 25th due to the petition.</p>
<p>Original Petition to Yu: The association's petition to Vice Minister Yu said: "The petition is for representatives to petition, but no practical results have been achieved. A second petition is made, hoping that you will examine and approve the matter of relief. The association has previously stated that the actual implementation of maritime administrative laws and regulations is not entirely suitable, resulting in an increase in the number of unemployed members and experiencing the pain of life. Therefore, in February of this year, representatives were elected to submit a petition and present the details. The Ministry issued the 477th approval, stating that the petition had been received and that the matters stated were approved for retention by the Ministry for investigation. After receiving this approval, it was found that the cause of member unemployment was actually due to the fact that seafarer service was not based on the certificates held, creating bad habits, such as serving at a higher level, or evading examination by claiming that the certificate was being applied for, taking advantage of customs clearance, and small companies hiring a large number of illegal seafarers with low wages, and using the names of a few certified personnel to fill and replace them, and falsely reporting the departure. The malpractices have been extremely serious. In the previous petition, the association had listed the main points of the relief measures and had hoped that they would be adopted and implemented. However, unexpectedly, things did not go as planned and no practical results were achieved. As far as the current situation is concerned, unemployed members are in deep water and fire, living like years. Swords and shoes, disheveled hair, and wearing crowns should be rescued immediately, for fear that it will be too late. It is still good to take your time and do it slowly, and keep it for investigation. It is decided to revitalize the withered crucian carp in the West River, but time waits for no one, and life is oppressive. How few will not ask me from the dried fish shop? Moreover, seafarer examination and the order for seafarers to serve at a higher level are still being processed as usual and have not been stopped. Nowadays, seafarers have long been oversupplied and are suffering from excess. However, if we do not draw firewood from under the cauldron and thoroughly solve the problem as a plan to rectify the origin, and continue to follow the old ways, then we will nurture hidden dangers, which will inevitably lead to congestion of seafarers and a complete collapse, and there will be a day when it will be irreparable. Unemployed members feel that the crisis is urgent and that it concerns their own interests. We hope that you, Minister, will come to Shanghai to inspect transportation administration and are eager to make a statement. After a general meeting, representatives Zhang, Cai Yuzhang, Mao Jinsheng, and Shen Xingsheng were elected to prepare documents and present the situation and make a wish. We hope that you will examine and approve the adoption of emergency measures, and first clearly abolish the two points of seafarer examination and service at a higher level. In the future, seafarer service will be based on the level of the certificate held as a principle to be taken as a preliminary step for relief. We urgently submit our petition and cannot help but anxiously await your orders."</p>
<h3>Newly Appointed Permanent Vice Minister of Finance, Xu Kan, Remains in Shanghai; Will Assume Office in Beijing Upon Receiving Formal Appointment</h3>
<p>According to the *New News Agency*, Qin Fen, Permanent Vice Minister of Finance and Secretary of the National Economic Council, has submitted his resignation from the position of Permanent Vice Minister of Finance due to the heavy workload of the Economic Council. The authorities have approved it and the Executive Yuan has decided to appoint Xu Kan as his successor. The *New News Agency* reporter learned from sources close to Xu yesterday that the official appointment from the Ministry of Finance has not yet arrived in Shanghai. It is said that Xu will go to Beijing from Shanghai after the appointment order arrives in Shanghai and hold an inauguration ceremony on a scheduled date.</p>
<h3>Central Machine Factory to be Built; Seamless Steel Pipe Factory; Construction of Three Factory Buildings to be Bid on Today</h3>
<p>The Central Machine Manufacturing Plant, which manufactures machines, steel castings, and iron castings, has been actively planning its construction and has already approved the bidding process. The machines ordered in England will also be shipped to Shanghai one after another. It is also planned to build another seamless steel pipe factory to start manufacturing various steel pipes. According to Lu Weipu, director of the plant's preparation office, speaking to a reporter from the *Ta Kung Pao* yesterday, the Central Machine Manufacturing Plant's machine, steel casting, and iron casting factories are very large in scale, covering an area of more than 100 mu, and are planned to be built entirely with cement and steel. Bids will be opened today and construction will begin within the month, which will take about until the end of the year to complete. The scope of manufacturing still needs to be determined based on the needs of the domestic industrial community. The machines purchased in England by the Ministry of Communications Purchasing Committee include hundreds of types of steel castings, iron castings, and large engines, totaling 120,000 pounds. The funds are allocated and borrowed from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee. All the ordered parts have begun to be shipped to Shanghai and will be able to be shipped to China by the end of this year. In addition to building machine, steel casting, and iron casting factories, the Central Machine Manufacturing Plant is currently planning to build another seamless steel pipe factory to manufacture various steel pipes. It can only be built after the above three factories are completed. The scale is also quite grand and will be built next to the three factories. Architects are currently being consulted to draw plans, which will be submitted to the ministry for review.</p>

<h3>Chinese Directors Vigorously Argue Against Telephone Price Increase; Request the Establishment of a Separate Subcommittee for Discussion</h3>
<p>The issue of telephone price increases in the Public Concession is due to the contractual relationship between the telephone company and the Municipal Council in the past. However, despite the efforts of the Chinese Ratepayers Association and the Japanese merchants in Shanghai, it has not been able to be concretely realized. This is because the market is depressed and the general public can hardly afford this extra expense. In the Municipal Council board meeting held at around 4 p.m. yesterday, in addition to discussing the issue of Chinese and rickshaws, this issue has also been included in the agenda. It is heard that the Chinese directors will raise important reasons to request the establishment of a separate subcommittee to discuss it at length in order to obtain fairness in the matter.</p>

<h3>American Political and Economic Experts Come to China for Inspection and Went to Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the *North China Daily News*, Dr. Ammini, an American political economist, is currently traveling in the Far East and has arrived in Shanghai. According to reports yesterday, he was deeply impressed by China's increasing emphasis on development. The doctor is a professor at Yale University and has written two books, one named "The Strategy of Raw Materials, an American Study in Peace and War," which has just been published in the United States and has been used as a textbook by many schools, and one co-authored with Simmons, named "The Great Powers in World Politics," whose abridged version is now named "The Value of Peace." The doctor is currently visiting various countries in the East purely for American political research. The doctor said that the Far Eastern issue has made the United States seriously aware. Today, the United States' policy focuses on isolation, in other words, we first focus on domestic politics, which is the "New Deal." However, this is an artificial situation. After a few years, we will definitely begin to focus on the East with all our strength. The doctor will go to Nanjing today. The doctor first went to Manila from Japan, then to Hong Kong and Guangzhou, planning to stay in the South for several weeks. After entering Beijing, he will go north to visit the old capital for several weeks, then to the Northeast, and return to the country via Japan. The doctor also said that he will write a book about the East. His impressions are, of course, very brief. What he can say now is only that the general public in China are now paying attention to political stability and have hopes for economic recovery. This is particularly surprising and deeply impressive. China's stability has indeed made progress, but it must at least obtain financial assistance from the great powers. The best way to achieve this is probably to restore the banking consortium and slightly change its organization.</p>
<h3>County: Deed Tax Halved and Extended for Another Three Months</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government received an order from the province stating that the deed tax rate in Jiangsu Province was originally 9.6% for sales, which was reduced to 6.3% for sales starting in May last year, with a limit of three months. Later, the time limit was extended successively, which expired at the end of April this year. At present, after the disaster, agriculture and commerce are in trouble. The deed tax rate for all fields and houses is planned to be collected at 6.3% for sales starting from May 1 this year. If the additional taxes and Zhongzi donations exceed half of the regular tax, they will be reduced to half of the regular tax. Those who have not reached half will remain as they are in order to reduce the burden. The county government issued a notice to the public yesterday to make it known to all. It should be known that this extension and price reduction is originally intended to show sympathy for the people's conditions. After the time limit expires, it will definitely not be extended again. Do not wait and see again and make a mistake.</p>

<h3>Raffle Ticket Number of Dafu Lai: Embezzling the Third Prize Money, Regarding a Police Officer as a Country Bumpkin to Deceive and Take Advantage; Repeated Negotiations Still Result in Embezzlement of Hundreds of Dollars</h3>
<p>The Shenhe Tai Tobacco and Paper Shop at No. 1481 Zhongge Road, Laoximenkou, Nanshi, is owned by a Mr. Ren from Ningbo. Since the issuance of various lottery tickets, the shopkeeper has established a ticket agency specializing in various lottery tickets within the shop, named Dafu Lai. Due to its central location, the shop's business has been quite prosperous. There was a police officer named Ren Zhihuai from the Gaoqiao Sub-bureau of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, currently 32 years old and from Anhui. On the 6th of this month, Officer Ren used one dollar of savings to purchase a "Little Champagne" lottery ticket at the Shenhe Tai Tobacco and Paper Shop (i.e., Dafu Lai Ticket Agency). The next day (the 7th) when the lottery was drawn, he actually won the third prize. Officer Ren was overjoyed and rushed from Pudong to Nanshi on the evening of the 11th to claim the prize. Unexpectedly, the shop staff, seeing Officer Ren in plain clothes and resembling a country bumpkin, disregarded all business ethics and falsely claimed that the ticket had won a small prize, paying him only 60 dollars. However, after Officer Ren received the prize money and returned to the bureau, he felt suspicious and inquired at the lottery headquarters on the 13th. He then learned that the ticket had indeed won the third prize and was entitled to 1,660 dollars. He immediately rushed back to the shop and negotiated vehemently. The shop staff, realizing they were in the wrong and fearing the situation would escalate, requested the intervention of Police Officer Hu Shancui, who was on duty at Post 27 of the Wenmiao Road Police Station, to mediate. As a result, the shop paid Officer Ren 890 dollars in two installments and forced him to write a receipt stating that he had received the full amount to settle the matter. Afterwards, the shop staff calculated that they had embezzled 770 dollars in prize money, so they gave 250 dollars to Police Officer Hu Shancui, who had mediated, instructing him not to publicize the matter and to divide the remaining money among themselves. Officer Ren also gave Officer Hu 60 dollars as a reward. However, after Officer Ren returned to the bureau and thought it over, he realized that the shop still owed him 710 dollars. Indignant, he reported the matter to Sub-bureau Chief Yao Guangding, who dispatched detectives along with the Chief of the Wenmiao Road Police Station to the shop on the morning of the day before yesterday. However, the shopkeeper, Mr. Ren, had already fled to his hometown in Ningbo upon hearing the news. The shop's accountant, Zhang Qinglan, was taken to the Wenmiao Road Police Station. Under questioning by Chief Tang Jinghuan, the defendant Zhang Qinglan admitted to deceiving Officer Ren and embezzling the prize money and stated that he was willing to pay the remaining 710 dollars owed to Officer Ren. He was granted bail to find a way to repay the debt. As for Police Officer Hu Shancui of the Wenmiao Road Police Station, who had mediated and accepted bribes, he absconded with the money after the incident and disappeared without a trace. The police station has arrested his guarantor for interrogation.</p>
<h3>National Goods Aid Relief Association: Lantern Parade Last Night</h3>
<p>The National Goods Movement Aid Relief Association of Penglai Road held a meeting at Penglai Market at 6:00 PM and set off at 8:00 PM. The route was as follows: Zhonghua Road, Xiaoximen, Dananmen, Xiaonanmen, Dadongmen (westward), Zhaojiabang Road, Laoximen, (northward) Minguo Road, Fangbang Road, Chenghuangmiao, Xiaodongmen (westward), Minguo Road, Xinbeimen, Laobeimen, Xiaobeimen, Laoximen, and concluding at Penglai Market. The Public Security Bureau dispatched police to maintain order along the route, and the crowds were so large that the streets were packed, creating a grand spectacle.</p>
<h3>Huanggang Tobacco Leaf Representatives: Requesting Allocation of American Tobacco Seeds</h3>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, the American Tobacco Leaf Improvement Committee of the Tax Affairs Department previously received a letter from representatives of the Huanggang tobacco leaf industry in Hunan, requesting the committee to allocate American tobacco seeds and fertilizers, and to send personnel to guide sowing and cultivation methods. After receiving the letter, the committee plans to hold a meeting to discuss and then reply. According to a spokesperson for the committee, Huanggang tobacco leaves are of good quality, with an annual output of about 20,000 to 30,000 bales (about 200 pounds per bale). However, the color is too light, and few Chinese tobacco factories use it, with most being sold to Germany. In recent years, due to the impact of natural disasters and human factors, tobacco farmers have inevitably engaged in adulteration and watering down, so the tobacco leaves are prone to mold and rot after packaging. As a result, the overseas market has plummeted. The current request to the committee is intended to improve tobacco leaves in order to restore the overseas market.</p>
<h3>Public Bus: Kills American Sailor</h3>
<p>Yesterday at approximately 5:25 PM, an American sailor named Mont Ponglai was walking near Mahou Road on Jing'an Temple Road when he was accidentally hit by a public bus. He sustained critical injuries and bled profusely, barely breathing. A nearby police officer noticed and helped him up, transporting him to the Baolong Hospital on Baker Road for treatment. Unfortunately, due to the severity of his injuries, he died in the hospital at 6:20 PM. The hospital reported the incident to the police station, and the body was sent to the coroner's office, where the American consulate in Shanghai was requested to examine it. The license plate number and details of the accident were recorded by the police officer and reported to the police station.</p>
<h3>Ingenious Tobacco Concealment Mechanism: Hidden in Electrical Wiring and Wooden Beams; Small Iron Hook Drops it Down at Any Time</h3>
<p>Public Concession Drug Enforcement Department West Detective Bai Pu and Chinese Detective No. 324 learned that someone was secretly selling opium in Room 736, Ren Zhi Li, North Sichuan Road, and profiting handsomely. On the day before yesterday at noon, they applied to the court for a search warrant and sent an informant to make a purchase to confirm the information. They secretly went to the location and arrested a Guangdong native named Huang Daorong. In the electrical wiring and wooden beams, they found 42 small tins of opium, weighing a total of nine taels. The electrical wiring and wooden boards were a secret hiding place for the opium. To retrieve the opium, a small iron hook was used to release the tins, which would then fall down naturally. It was very ingenious. They also found an iron hook, a set of smoking paraphernalia, two account books, and two jiao coins, along with a suspect named Deng Ming. All were taken to the Hongkou Police Station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Special District Court. Judge Wu Zehan interrogated the two defendants and sentenced Huang Daorong to one year and six months of imprisonment, with the evidence confiscated. Deng Ming was found not guilty and released. Labor Bureau lawyer Li Zhishan waived the right to appeal, and he was immediately released.</p>
<h3>After Attempting Suicide by Poison, Young Man Goes to Cinema to Await Death: Apology Note Left at Cinema</h3>
<p>Zhang Siying, a young man in his early twenties, had been unemployed for a long time and was living in poverty. On the day before yesterday, he suddenly became despondent and purchased opium to secretly consume. Afterwards, in the afternoon, he went to the Central Cinema on Beihai Road to watch a movie, waiting for death to arrive. At 5:15 PM, a server at the cinema, Xing Sigen, discovered him collapsed on the ground. He immediately went outside and informed the nearby police officer on duty, who reported it to the Lao Zha Police Station. Detective Pang Yutang was dispatched to investigate and transported him to Renji Hospital. The treatment was ineffective, and he soon died. A box of empty opium was found near his body, along with a suicide note stating that he had reached the end of his rope due to the harsh environment and felt deeply guilty for committing suicide in their establishment. The body was taken to the Philan Road coroner's office. Yesterday morning, Guo Weijian, an inspector from the First Special District Local Court, arrived at the coroner's office to examine the body. According to the detective, when they investigated at the hospital, the deceased was not yet dead and only stated his name and age before becoming unable to speak. Therefore, his residence and whether he had relatives were unknown. Guo ordered that the examination determine that the deceased, Zhang Siying, was a male who died from opium poisoning, and the body was to be handed over to Pushan Villa for burial.</p>
<h3>Bandit Leader Escorted: Did Not Commit Crimes in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Bandit leader Fang Zhekui, also known as Fang Wenyuan, was accused of leading a group of accomplices in Jinyun and Changshan counties in Zhejiang province last year, committing major crimes such as kidnapping, robbery, murder, and arson. After the crimes, he fled to Shanghai. Recently, Ying Weishui, the captain of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Department, and Chi Lian, the captain of the Changshan County Basic Team, learned of his whereabouts and came to Shanghai by car to investigate. After confirming the information, they collaborated with Detective Li Shizhong and Detective Ding Huaguo of the Xinzha Police Station to arrest the bandit Fang Zhekui, Liao Shuiqing, Sheng Shuisheng (aka Wang Azhang), Wang Shuiting, and Zhang Laopei at No. 12, Lane 229, Carter Road, and other locations. Under interrogation at the First Special Court, the police suspected that Dong was a notorious bandit who had been staying in the concession for several months, making it likely that he had committed robberies. Therefore, they requested permission to detain him for investigation. The request was approved. Yesterday morning, during the continued interrogation, the police escorted Fang and the others to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Qian Kunuo, stated that during the adjournment, the police detectives began to investigate and summoned 40 to 50 robbery victims to the police station to identify whether the robbers were among them. However, none of the victims could identify them. Therefore, the police concluded that Fang and the others had not committed any crimes in the concession. Furthermore, Fang Zhekui had confessed to kidnapping a resident, Liu, in Changshan County and hiding him in the Xianshendong cave in the twelfth district of Changshan North Township, preparing to negotiate a ransom. Therefore, they agreed to the transfer. However, when Captain Ying Weishui of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Department arrested the suspects in the concession, Ying and the other two officers carried firearms without a Labor Bureau license and did not notify the police beforehand. Therefore, the firearms were temporarily confiscated by the police. The police recently received a letter from the Security Department requesting their return. However, according to the police, Ying Weishui himself should come to claim them. Finally, Du Xiushan, a bailiff from the Hangzhou Local Court, submitted a document requesting the transfer.

<h3>Kidnapping Case of Yu Hezhenya: Kidnappers Sentenced Separately; Lin De Sentenced to Life Imprisonment; Zhang and Zhou Each Sentenced to 15 Years</h3>
<p>Yu Hezhenya, a Cantonese Catholic resident at No. 60 Aixiems Road in the French Concession, was kidnapped on the morning of October 21st last year at 8:00 AM while traveling in her private car to the Catholic Church at the intersection of Luban Road and Father Lu Road to attend mass. Not far from her home, near the Gaosan Branch on West Aixiems Road, she was suddenly abducted by kidnappers who demanded a ransom of 300,000 dollars. After receiving a letter from the kidnappers, the family arranged to negotiate the ransom at the Sanxin Hotel outside the Panmen Gate in Suzhou. On the afternoon of November 19th, the French Police sent detectives to Suzhou and arrested two kidnappers, Wang Fukang and a suspect, Li Shengxiao. Wang confessed that the victim was being held in a pavilion at No. 386 Yulin Road in Shanghai. The detectives notified the Shanghai French Police by long-distance telephone. Jin Jiulin, the director of the special agency, led detectives from the general shift along with detectives from the Yulin Road Police Station to the address, rescued the victim, and arrested four men and women who were guarding her: Tao Shuigen, Lin De, Zhang Huizhi, and Zhou Juqin. During the arrest, Tao and Lin fired shots and resisted, injuring Detective Zhang Chunsheng of the 47th squad in the leg. Tao and Lin were also injured. The French Police sent the injured to the hospital for treatment and transferred the uninjured suspects to the Second Special District Local Court for interrogation and investigation. Tao Shuigen later died from his injuries. The Second Special District Court conducted an interrogation, and the Police Department filed a public prosecution for trial based on the Law for the Punishment of Bandits. During the trial, the victim, after escaping danger, fell ill and left Shanghai for treatment at Peking Union Medical College in Beijing. The Second Special District Court sent photos of the suspects and a formal request to the Beijing Local Court to conduct an investigation and ask the victim to identify Wang Fukang, Tao Shuigen, Lin De, etc. at the scene as the perpetrators of the kidnapping and those who assisted in guarding the victim. The Beijing Court replied to the Second Special District Court. Judge Sun Yingzhi repeatedly held court sessions to study the case. Because Wang Fukang was seriously ill and receiving treatment at Guangci Hospital and could not be brought to court, the court ordered that the trial of the other defendants be concluded first and a date set for sentencing. This has been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday was the date of sentencing. At 10:00 AM, Judge Sun of the First Criminal Court ordered the defendants to be brought to the court. Lin De was sentenced to life imprisonment for jointly committing kidnapping and robbery, and deprived of his civil rights for life. He was also sentenced to three years in prison for using methods that could cause death and injuring a person, but the sentence was merged into life imprisonment with deprivation of civil rights for life. Zhang Huizhi and Zhou Juqin were each sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment for assisting in kidnapping and robbery, and deprived of their civil rights for 15 years. The number of days spent in detention before the verdict was finalized was converted to one day of imprisonment for every two days. The two firearms and bullets seized were confiscated. Li Shengxiao was found not guilty. The trial of Wang Fukang was suspended. The public prosecution of Tao Shuigen was dismissed. During the appeal period, the defendants were returned to the detention center.</p>
<h3>Falsely Accused of Enticing Cousin: Private Confinement and Beating</h3>
<p>Fang Yiqiang, a 20-year-old Suzhou youth residing at No. 4, Ji Wu Fang, Ximen Road, French Concession, previously studied in the third grade of junior high school at Qinghua Middle School. He recently dropped out of school and stayed at home. His cousin, Chen Lindi (15 years old, from Suzhou, the daughter of his maternal uncle), lived in the Fang family. She suddenly disappeared at about 10:00 PM on the evening of the 11th of this month. Fang's younger sister, Shunhua, and Shunhua's classmate, Shen Yuying, from Huzhou, informed Fang that they had seen Lindi on the evening of the 6th (King's Birthday) at Zhu Huaxing Tailor Shop, No. 9, Deyu Lane, Nanjing Road. She was with a companion watching the lantern festival. On the road, they met Zhao Zhengfang (20 years old, from Ningbo), a shop assistant at the Xinzha Photo Studio, No. 193, Xinzha Road. They heard Zhao chatting with Lindi and inviting her to watch a movie at the Moonlight Grand Theater on Baire Road on the evening of the 8th. Suspecting Zhao, Fang dismissed it with a laugh because he had no solid evidence. However, on the afternoon of the 13th, at about 4:00 PM, Fang Shunhua, Shen Yuying, and another classmate, Xie Bingrong, met Zhao on the tram on North Sichuan Road. Zhao made an excuse to get off the tram, appearing flustered. That evening at 10:30 PM, Shunhua and Shen Yuying met Zhao again at the Zhu Huaxing Tailor Shop in Deyu Lane. The suspicion that Zhao had enticed Lindi deepened. Shunhua and the others returned home and reported to their brother, Fang Yiqiang. At the time, Fang had just finished swimming at the Wing On Company Sky Garden with his friends Qian E (20 years old, local, resident of No. 100, Mofang Street, formerly worked at Siwen Foreign Company, now filming movies), Ouyang Cheng (19 years old, from Danyang, a bookkeeper at the Jiufu Hotel, East Zilaihuo Street), and Zhu Yi (12 years old, from Ningbo, Zhejiang, resident of No. 271, Youxing Lane, Daiding Road, works at the Li Xin Printing Shop). Upon hearing the news, he and Qian and the others rushed to the Zhu Huaxing Tailor Shop, seized Zhao, and forced him to hand over his cousin Lindi. Zhao denied the matter. Fang and the others forcibly took Zhao back to their home at No. 4, Ji Wu Fang, confined him in a side room, beat him, and threatened him to hand over Lindi. The next morning at 7:00 AM, Fang took Zhao to the Yafei Road Police Station. After questioning, the police officer found that the statements of both parties were inconsistent, but noticed that Zhao had injuries. The police arrested Fang and dispatched detectives to arrest Fang's friends Qian, Ouyang, and Zhu at about 6:00 PM that afternoon. Yesterday, they were all transferred to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Judge Zhao Zuo interrogated them. Police lawyer Fei Xizhen explained the case and requested an adjournment for further investigation. He asked for a verdict. The complainant Zhao Zhengfang testified that he did not entice Fang Yiqiang's cousin. He used to work at Qichang on Nanjing Road and lived in Deyu Lane, No. 17 behind it, so he knew her sister. He was abducted to Fang's house at 1:30 AM the night before, tied with thin ropes, beaten with wooden sticks, and threatened with a knife. Fang Yiqiang confessed that he beat him twice because he refused to tell the truth. Qian and the other three were also interrogated and gave the same statements. After reviewing the testimonies, the court adjourned the case for further hearing on the 21st. The defendant Fang Yiqiang was detained, and the other defendants were released on bail of 1,500 dollars. Those who could not provide bail were detained. The complainant Zhao Zhengfang was ordered to go to the forensic office for an injury examination.</p>
<h3>Lu Yuangen Seriously Wounded by Gunfire in Robbery of Gongda Silk Factory</h3>
<p>The Japanese-owned Gongda No. 3 Silk Factory on Singapore Road in West Shanghai has more than 1,000 male and female workers, divided into day and night shifts. The 15th and 30th of each month are the designated dates for paying wages. The Japanese factory management, for the sake of caution, temporarily requests the Caojiadu Public Security Bureau to dispatch three armed police officers to provide security during each payout. Yesterday was the 15th, the designated payday. At 4:30 PM, the wages for the day shift workers were paid in full, and the armed police officers withdrew. Approximately a quarter of an hour later, three robbers wearing blue cloth shirts and pants, each armed with a handgun, scaled the short wall behind the factory and entered the payroll department. Two robbers immediately seized a wooden box containing banknotes (over 1,000 dollars) intended for the night shift workers, and fled the same way they came. Lu Yuangen, a staff member of the department, pursued them. Unexpectedly, a robber who had been left behind fired at Lu, hitting him in the back and exiting through his chest. He immediately collapsed to the ground. The robbers then fled over the wall, firing two more shots. The doorman heard the shots and rushed in, finding Lu lying injured in a pool of blood. Realizing that a robbery had taken place, he immediately reported it to the Gordon Road Patrol Station and the Caojiadu Branch by telephone. Director Wang, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched Inspectors Yang and Long, along with Detective Squad Leader Geng Choubao, to lead the entire team of detectives and armed police to the scene. The robbers had already fled without a trace. They searched the open area behind the factory and found the abandoned wooden box on the ground, with 18 bundles of banknotes remaining. After the factory staff checked, it was determined that 861 dollars had been stolen. The injured Lu Yuangen (32 years old) was transported by ambulance to the Fumin Hospital on Qiujiang Road for treatment. However, his injuries were severe and he was in critical condition. Director Wang immediately ordered all officers and detectives under his command to make every effort to arrest the robbers and recover the stolen goods.</p>
<h3>Isola Circus: Two Lions Become Beastly, Attack Indian Animal Trainer</h3>
<p>According to the Mainland News, at 8:00 AM on Tuesday, a photographer from a Shanghai Russian newspaper went to the Isola Circus to take pictures of lions and tigers. The animal trainer, an Indian named Douteli, led four giant lions and one tiger into the performance area. While he was giving instructions, one of the largest lions suddenly became aggressive and struck Douteli's shoulder with its paw. Douteli fell to the ground, holding only a small whip. He quickly lashed out at the lion's face. The lion retreated a few steps, about to attack again, but Douteli endured the pain, got up, and hid behind several small stools used for the performance. When the lion came forward again, Douteli grabbed a large stick for self-defense and shouted for help. Unexpectedly, another small lion pounced on Douteli from behind. At this critical moment, the circus manager, Self Leik, also a famous animal trainer, arrived with a pitchfork and drove the animals back into their cages. Douteli's left shoulder, head, face, and chest were scratched, and his left hand was also injured. He was covered in blood and rushed to the hospital by ambulance for treatment. He will need many days before he can return to the stage.</p>
<h3>Decision of the Second Special District Citizens' Assembly: Severely Punish the Circus Member for Rape; Letter to the French Consul General for Investigation</h3>
<p>The Second Special District Citizens' Joint Association held its eleventh plenary meeting of directors yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. Over twenty people attended, including He Yuanming, Zhang Zongyao, Wu Guowei, Zhang Gengshan, Xi Jingyan, Li Weiliang, Dong Wenli, Huang Xianggu, Ye Ruiqi, Wu Xiu, Wang Deyan, Qu Zhenhua, Guo Shuliang, Dong Kechang, Mao Yun, and Chang Daotong. Huang Xianggu was elected chairman. After the ceremonial opening, the chairman reported on the implementation of the resolutions of the district representatives' meeting. They then discussed the issue of the Isola Circus member raping Yin Shengtao's 13-year-old adopted daughter. According to a letter from the Shanghai Theatrical Guild Association, "The Isola Circus member dared to commit inhuman acts against Yin Shengtao's adopted daughter in broad daylight, trampling and ravaging her, causing immense pain and anger. Although the police have been investigating the case, they have released the main witness, demonstrating their negligence and intentional protection. We request your support and assistance." It was unanimously agreed that since the circus member's criminal act has been confirmed, the police should file a public prosecution with the court and impose the appropriate punishment. However, the police have not filed a public prosecution and have released the main witness, indicating an ulterior motive. If such a serious case is not severely punished, how can the residents of the concession be protected? It was decided to forward a letter to the French Consul General for investigation.</p>
<h3>Three Foreigners Robbed Liwei Jewelry Company: Losses to be Investigated, Estimated at Approximately 100,000 Gold; Three Robbers' Accent Suggested American Nationality</h3>
<p>The French-owned Liwei Jewelry Company at No. 75, Nanjing Road, Jiangxi Road, has been selling diamond jewelry for many years. The shareholders are Liwei and Mannell. In addition to the two shareholders serving as managers, the store employs four Chinese staff members and one salesman. Recently, shareholder Liwei returned to his home country, and Mannell managed all the affairs of the store. However, at 12:10 PM yesterday, during the busy lunch hour when office workers were leaving for lunch, three elegantly dressed foreigners suddenly entered the store, claiming to buy watches. Mannell personally greeted them and opened the safe, taking out valuable watches for them to choose from. At that moment, the three foreign customers suddenly drew handguns, threatening the store staff to remain silent and forcing shareholder Mannell into the inner room, tying him up with wire. One robber dumped the precious diamond jewelry from the opened safe, totaling 24 trays, into a small bag. The three robbers then took the opportunity to escape into the crowd, disappearing without a trace. The store staff managed to report to the Central Police Station, which immediately dispatched detectives to investigate at various road intersections, but it was too late. After the incident, a reporter visited the store. According to the staff, the store had been robbed and burglarized twice before. This was the third time. The first time, robbers dug through the wall to steal the jewelry. The second time, they smashed the display window in front of the store and stole the jewelry. Both times, the losses were not significant. One robber was caught and sentenced to several months in prison. The stolen diamonds, bracelets, watches, and rings were numerous this time. Mannell and the Wantai Insurance Company are currently conducting a thorough audit of the accounts. The store had previously purchased insurance from Wantai Insurance due to previous losses. The total amount of the losses has not yet been determined, but it is estimated to be around 100,000 gold. The store has two safes. The safe that was robbed contained the most valuable jewelry. The other safe was not opened. The robbers seemed to be very familiar with the store's operations. The police have taken fingerprints and are conducting a thorough investigation. According to Mannell, judging from the robbers' accents, they seemed to be American.</p>

<h3>Gaoqiao, Xiling Home Establishes Defense Corps</h3>
<p>The Xiling Home in Gaoqiao, Pudong, is located to the left of Xiaosha (i.e., Laoshusha), which is the closest distance. Since foreign merchants from various countries established oil pools in the Xiaosha area, people of mixed quality have been entering and exiting, impacting the area. As a result, petty theft and robbery have occurred from time to time. Although Yao Guang, the director of the Gaoqiao Public Security Bureau, has, at the request of local residents, dispatched three patrol police officers to be stationed here, the vastness of the village makes the police force insufficient to manage. Local self-defense is now a matter of urgency. Recently, Lu Xiaoxiang, director of the Xiling Home Rural Improvement Branch, Ling Sifei, a clerk, Lu Dong, principal of Renji Primary School, and Bo Sheng, general director of the Gaoqiao Rural Improvement Association, and others submitted a request to the Gaoqiao Headquarters of the Shanghai Security Association, requesting permission to establish a branch defense station in the Xiling Home village to induce and awaken local residents to self-defense. The Gaoqiao Headquarters approved and permitted the organization to be assisted, and it was decided to formally recruit promising local youths for training starting on May 25th.</p>
<h3>Increasing Number of Refugees in the City: Charity Organizations to Hold Joint Meeting Tomorrow to Discuss Relief Measures</h3>
<p>Wang Yiting, Chairman of the Joint Association of Charity Organizations in this city, and Huang Hanzhi, Vice Chairman, stated that due to the severe drought in various provinces last year, rural economies have collapsed, industry and commerce are declining, and the poor common people and refugees from various provinces and counties have come to Shanghai. They can be seen everywhere in the streets and alleys. The sounds of weeping and lamenting in front of Renji Hall every day are tragic. The poor and helpless in this city mostly beg for food and clothing, while those from other provinces mostly plead for boat tickets and travel expenses to return to their hometowns. The association has verified and provided assistance accordingly. However, since the "January 28th Incident," the economy in this city has continued to decline, making it very difficult to raise funds. Therefore, it is necessary to find practical and thorough solutions to carry out the aforementioned relief efforts. The association has specifically consulted with the board of directors of the Xinwei Relief Association and decided to convene a joint meeting of various charitable organizations on the 17th of this month to jointly find solutions. The notice was issued yesterday, stating, "Regarding the urgent meeting scheduled for 4:00 PM on the 17th of this month (Friday) in the association's meeting room at the Renji Shantang on Yunnan Road to discuss important matters. Your attendance is highly appreciated. Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Association."</p>
<h3>China Ham Company: Exclusive Sales Rights Extended for Five Years; Ministry of Industry Orders Commodity Inspection Bureau to Comply</h3>
<p>The China Ham Joint-Stock Company requested the Ministry of Industry to approve the extension of its exclusive sales rights for ham produced to the American Philippines for another five years, which has been approved by order. The Commodity Inspection Bureau has also been ordered to comply. The original order stated, "According to the request of the China Ham Joint-Stock Company for an extension of five years for its exclusive sales rights for ham produced to the American Philippines, the Ministry believes that 'this type of foreign trade, if it does not hinder domestic competitors and can have a sound organization to avoid mutual infighting, is necessary.' Certain provisions were also stipulated: (1) The slaughterhouse and ham factory must be substantially expanded to produce approximately 1,500 boxes of ham for the Philippines annually; (2) The aforementioned expansion should be negotiated and cooperated with all ham manufacturers to ensure equal benefits; (3) The hams for sale must be produced by the factory and not purchased to make up for numbers. If the expanded production still cannot meet the demand in the Philippines, other manufacturers may also report for inspection and export." The instructions should be strictly followed and reported for review. It is now reported that "the company's economic management and factory equipment are sufficient to produce and sell 1,200 boxes. All hams sold to the Philippines are self-produced and not purchased to make up for numbers. If the production is insufficient or purchases occur, the company is willing to accept punishment and sanctions and will not reject cooperation from all ham manufacturers in Rugao." After reviewing the report, it is considered feasible. To maintain foreign trade, the extension of exclusive sales rights for five years is tentatively approved. In addition to submitting the request to the Executive Yuan for review and filing and instructing the company to comply, the Bureau is hereby ordered to comply and instruct the inspectors stationed in the factory to strictly carry out post-slaughter inspections and report the number of products and sales figures monthly for verification. This order."</p>

<h3>United Premium Company Holds United Premium Sales Plan</h3>
<p>The United Premium Company, located at 20 Sichuan Road, has been assisting merchants in promoting their products with United Premium Coupons since its official opening last autumn, with the intention of promoting thorough cooperation between production and sales. However, since the beginning of this year, various manufacturers have been affected by the sluggish market and have been unable to use the coupons for a while, so the momentum has not been as strong as before. The company is currently working on improving the premium plan to suit the needs of society and solve the promotional problems of various manufacturers. A great plan will soon be realized step by step. The company recognizes that the United Premium Exchange Center attached to Sincere Company on Nanjing Road has convenient transportation and a central location, with a large number of people passing by every day.

It will be realized soon. This plan is cost-effective and has a high impact for the participating manufacturers, and it provides unexpected benefits for the public. Both parties benefit. This is the first trial run, and it will be gradually expanded to various regions in the future. It is expected that there will be a lot of excitement after the start.</p>

<h3>Shandong Education Department Prepares to Place Graduates from Colleges and Above; Provincial Government Orders Examination for Administrative Personnel Training</h3>
<p>(Jinan Correspondence) Director of Education He Siyuan is currently investigating the number of students from this province studying in colleges and universities outside the province who are graduating this summer, totaling 358 people. Placement should be planned in advance for those in science, agriculture, medicine, engineering, literature, law, commerce, education, and other subjects so that they can serve. At the provincial government meeting on the 14th, this case was brought up for discussion. It was decided to inform the Administrative Personnel Training Institute of this province to conduct examinations so that after the training period expires, the best candidates will be selected for employment. The original proposal is recorded below.</p>
<p>Original Proposal: According to Article 1 of the University Organization Law and Article 1 of the College Organization Law, the mission of universities is to study advanced academics and cultivate specialized talents, and the mission of colleges is to teach applied sciences and cultivate technical talents. Since the success of the revolution in our country, construction projects have been advancing in various ways, and there is an urgent need for various talents. Therefore, we do not hesitate to spend millions of dollars to operate universities and colleges, so as to cultivate advanced talents to meet the current urgent needs. However, in recent years, graduates from various schools have often been unable to find employment and have been idle, while the government often feels that there is an insufficient distribution of talents when operating new emerging industries. Students have the worry of unemployment, and the government has the sigh of difficulty in cultivating talents. This kind of contradictory phenomenon should not be ignored. Taking this province as an example, we have already established a medical college, and we are using huge sums to assist National Shandong University. At the same time, we are also setting up scholarship quotas in various universities and colleges inside and outside the province, so as to encourage the academic achievements of Shandong students. We have never slackened our efforts in cultivating advanced talents. There are hundreds of Shandong graduates from various universities and colleges every year. If we can accommodate them as much as possible in the various levels of agencies, factories, and schools in this province, so that they can use what they have learned, it will be of great benefit to both the public and the private. Otherwise, it is more uneconomical to spend money to store talents and place talents without using them. It is proposed that the provincial government plan comprehensively and stipulate detailed measures to allocate services to the Lu Lai graduates of various universities and colleges every year according to their subjects, so as to avoid unemployment. The Education Department has now completed the investigation. In total, there are 358 Lu Lai students from colleges and universities graduating this summer, including 60 in science, 9 in agriculture, 11 in medicine, 26 in engineering, 130 in literature, 95 in law, 3 in commerce, and 24 in education. It should be decided how to allocate services, and the list of graduating students should be submitted together for public decision.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Plans to Stipulate the Implementation Period of the Degree Granting Law</h3>
<p>Since the National Government announced the 12 articles of the Degree Granting Law, it is necessary to grant academic degrees to those graduating from universities and independent colleges this summer. Now that summer vacation is not far away, it is necessary to set the date of implementation of the Degree Granting Law as soon as possible. In view of this, the Ministry of Education has formulated the date of implementation of the Degree Granting Law and attached the measures for determining the period for starting the granting of various scales of degrees, and submitted them to the Executive Yuan yesterday to be submitted to the National Government for promulgation. As for the date of implementation, it will be determined and announced after the National Government approves it.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Education Branch Discusses Reducing Holidays and Shortening the Academic Year; Opinions are Divided into Considerable Approval and Opposition; Opinions Have Been Sent to the Nanjing General Association</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou Correspondence) The Guangzhou Branch of the Chinese Education Society held a regular meeting the other day, attended by more than ten people, including Huang Qiming, He Yintang, Huang Chengqiu, Lin Liru, Cui Zaiyang, Gao Juefu, Li Yanling, Zeng Zhaosen, Jiang Jingsan, Zhu Youguang, and Xu Xiling. The meeting discussed the proposal of Sun Ke and five other committee members to "reduce holidays and shorten the academic year" submitted by the Fanjing General Association. As a result of the discussion, opinions were divided into considerable approval and opposition, which were immediately submitted to the Nanjing General Association. Their opinions are as follows.</p>
<p>Considerable Approval Opinions: (1) School holidays make the education industry similar to the leisure class. Shortening holidays can avoid creating a leisure class. (2) The academic year of each school can be shortened, but the curriculum must be changed. (3) From the perspective of the countryside, holidays are not needed, and most of China is a rural society. (4) Attention should be paid to high-ability and low-ability students. The academic year for high-ability students can be shortened, while the academic year for low-ability students needs to be extended. (3) The date of holidays during the year should be considered separately according to the situation in rural and urban areas. For example, the harvest season of rice and wheat in the north and south is different. If the number of holidays is stipulated, the period should not be stipulated. (6) One day off every two weeks is not as good as half a day off every week. (7) Open summer classes so that high-achieving students can graduate in three years, and low-achieving students have time to make up lessons. (8) If students graduate too young, it seems feasible to find a way to serve in the government for a year or receive military training. (9) In order to promote universal education, we approve shortening the years of primary school. (10) How this case is based on speculation, and how it is in reality, we might as well choose a province to test it. (10) (1) How to make good use of holidays is also a major issue. There is indeed a waste of time during the current holidays.</p>
<p>Opposition Opinions: (1) Shortening the academic year without planning new graduation standards means that shortening the academic year is just getting a diploma quickly. This kind of proposal is meaningless. (2) Reducing holidays means that teachers have no opportunity to do research, and knowledge will inevitably decline. (3) Without holidays, you must read dead books, because staff and students have no opportunity to contact society. (4) Education is difficult, and it all depends on holidays. If there is no freedom, who will be willing to take on the job? If life is too mechanical, people will regard it as a dangerous path. (5) Without regular rest, the efficiency does not seem good based on actual experience. (6) If teachers have fewer holidays, they will lack time to do social work, such as popular education. (7) If the school year is shortened, the homework will be tight, not only will there not be enough time to digest it, but it will also be harmful to the body. (8) One month of summer vacation makes it difficult to enroll students, and there is not enough time to hire teachers. (9) Students' job prospects are easier, and society has no place to accommodate them. (10) Shortening the academic year means that students graduate young and have difficulty finding employment. (10) (1) If summer vacation is required to set up classes for make-up lessons, then there will be no summer vacation during the year.</p>

Since the implementation of the partial school plan of the Shanghai Experimental Primary School of Jiangsu Province on Shangwen Road, a workshop has been set up in the first department and a farm in the third department, and efforts have been devoted to labor production education. This time, personnel have been sent in advance to select a part of the products from the workshop and farm, pack them in boxes, and transport them to Wuxi for display. The workshop department mainly produces scientific toys, totaling more than 100 pieces. The farm department mainly produces vegetables, ordinary agricultural products, flowers, fruits, and animal husbandry. All are marked with the selling price for guests to purchase to serve as the school's construction fund. However, since the products are all made and planted by students at a lower cost, the selling price is also cheaper than the market price.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>—(Elementary School Student)</p>
<p>Will the textbooks for the next semester use Chinese paper or foreign newspaper print? This question, I think, is easily resolved:</p>
<p>Just print the following on the copyright page, which can be distinguished, and is very convenient for calculation during wholesale:</p>
<p>[Chinese Paper] [Foreign Paper] [Price]</p>
<p>According to this method, if wholesaling at a 30% discount, first deduct 30% of a dime, which is seven cents, and add four cents, totaling eleven cents. The addition is the premium for Chinese paper. If retailing at an 80% discount from the original price, the profit is only one cent. Now, it can be sold for twelve cents, still earning one cent. Each elementary school student buys no more than ten books, increasing the cost by a maximum of forty cents. However, the outflow of profit can be completely recovered. This method can be applied to any book. (Elementary School Student)</p>
<h3>Beside the Airfield</h3>
<p>— Xu Haowu</p>
<p>An employee directing a servant pushed open the iron wire mesh gate. The news that the plane would descend in a few minutes strongly hooked my longing heart.</p>
<p>The impressions gained for half the day: A young woman with curly hair and fashionable clothes, mixed among a crowd of elderly Buddhist women wearing yellow pouches and fingering prayer beads, shyly touched the feet of the Child-Giving Goddess, put on pre-made shoes and socks for it, turned back and knelt before the Buddha's seat in the main hall, devoutly seeking a divination stick.</p>
<p>So many people were crowded in the temple. The temple keeper, beaming, desperately blew out the newly lit candles, pulled them out and stuffed them into a basket stained with oil, still feeling there weren't enough candle holders.</p>
<p>Carefree men and women, tired of the city where they live day and night, took advantage of the bright spring sunshine to stroll hand in hand into the private gardens of the countryside. The warm breeze and beautiful flowers intoxicated and seduced their tender hearts. They spoke and joked boisterously. Thunderous laughter, passing through the stacked rocks of the artificial mountain, ruthlessly startled the startled oriole murmuring secrets in the willow shade.</p>
<p>At night, a gentle cool breeze blew, seeing off these "talented scholars and beautiful women." The aircraft, carrying news from afar, broke through the misty haze behind the pagoda, spreading its wings diagonally, majestically circling above our heads. Where the white smoke rose, the cement factory by the river pulled out a wailing echo, as if representing us, the scattered audience, expressing the most sincere welcome to this modern scientific monster.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Chinese Women's Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Huiren</p>
<p>The second Chinese Women's Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition at the Lake Society was as crowded as the exhibition at the ancient palace in London. The excellent works were indeed a surprising improvement over last year, worthy of being called aspiring writers. Upon first going upstairs, one immediately saw Yang Xuejiu's large landscape painting, bold and vigorous with splashed ink. Li Qiujun's landscape figure painting "Flower Shadow Blowing Sheng," with its antique and elegant colors, was quite similar to a jade pot. Chen Xiaocui's "Lychee Fragrance Near," and "Half River Red Trees Selling Perch," were fresh and elegant, approaching Xiaolou, while "Lotus Lantern Retreats from the Courtyard" and "Iron Flute Picture" had lofty and unrestrained brushstrokes, resembling Xinluo in spirit. The two paintings, "Mountain Ghost Night Hunting" and "Autumn Grave Ghost Singing," had particularly strange conceptions. One imagines that Xiaocui is usually good at writing Changji-style poems, hence these strange works? Gu Qingyao's landscape paintings were all excellent, worthy of being Ruobo's granddaughter. Zhu Zhixian's chicken paintings were lively and full of natural spirit. Nie Qide's "Magu," by an eighty-year-old, possessed such eyesight, capable of meticulous figure painting, truly rare. Lu Xiaoman learned painting from He Tianjian. Her landscape paintings were beautiful, quiet, and dust-free. Li Huashu's camellias and parrots were close to Zongyuan. Tang Guanyu's "Three Friends of Winter" was neat, delicate, and refined. Other excellent works by Zhao Hanying, Mao Suihua, Wu Qingxia, Zhu Renyan, Gu Fei, Bao Yahui, Xu Hui, Xu Lengcui, Jiang Yanan, Ding Yunbi, Pang Zuoyu, Jin Qiusheng, and the Xiong sisters were numerous and various, like entering a jade tree forest. It is impossible to mention them all. In calligraphy, Feng Wenfeng and Jiang Daofan's large brushstrokes were like oaks, washing away the habits of boudoir delicacy. However, Zhou Lianxia's fan-shaped fine folds, smaller than pearls, were also pleasing.</p>
<p>The special issue of paintings and calligraphy sold was entirely printed on utilization paper. Its spirit of resolutely promoting domestic goods was especially admirable. The poems and lyrics contained within were quite excellent. In the past, Zheng Qian's three perfections were known as superb skills, and now, boudoir talents are so numerous and gathered together in one hall, which is also a wonderful story. Therefore, I am happy to record it.</p>
<h3>On the Road of Life</h3>
<p>— Cyclone</p>
<h3>A Record of the Max Factor Performance</h3>
<p>— Zhou Wenpu</p>
<p>As early summer arrived and the weather gradually warmed, summer clothing was urgently needed. My wife repeatedly urged me to buy some. I could no longer continue to prevaricate. Reading the newspaper, I saw that the Sincere Company was having a sale and holding a Max Factor sound film and fashion show. So I accompanied my wife and drove to see it.</p>
<p>The cinema was located on the second floor. Although the area was not large, the layout was quite exquisite. It was surrounded by blue curtains. Inside and outside the curtains hung many photos of Max Factor's makeup for Hollywood stars. The venue was decorated with colorful electric lights and chairs, giving it an artistic flair, like a small-scale cinema. It was showing films at any time, with free admission. Using sound films for commercial promotion, the power of its advertising effect is self-evident.</p>
<p>The film was in color, clear and watchable. The actors were all first-class Hollywood stars. The plot was nothing more than instructing the audience on how to use Max Factor cosmetics. The performers, before and after using the products, were immediately like different people. Their ability to change appearances, enhance beauty, and add splendor could all be seen on the screen by the audience. A room was opened on the east end of the screen, filled with various Max Factor cosmetics. A Western woman was also providing free beauty treatments to visitors. Many female guests requested the treatment, creating a lively and bustling atmosphere. I then borrowed my wife to visit the fashion show on the fifth floor. The applause was deafening as soon as the elevator reached the fourth floor. Upon arriving at the venue, we saw Miss Li performing in an evening gown. The male and female audience members stretched their necks and waited expectantly. There was almost no room to stand in the folds of the crowd. The latecomers flocked in, surging like a tide. When one scene ended, cheers erupted. Finally, the wireless reported a swimsuit performance. The air suddenly became tense and silent. Soon, four ladies came out in single file, barefoot and bare-armed, their postures moving, their curves fully revealed, and their beauty delectable. The performers wore coy smiles, as if unable to overcome their shyness. We were among them, as if we were in a seaside bathing place.</p>
<p>Biographical Notes</p>
<h3>Lamenting Xie Yucen</h3>
<p>— Qian Xiaoshan</p>
<p>Alas, my elder sister's passing was three years ago, and now my Yucen has also died. Death is inevitable for all people, something that even sages, worthies, and heroes throughout history could not escape. If one can fully utilize their talents and exhaust their abilities, then death is without regret. But in Yucen's case, how could he die? Your grandmother, Qian, was my paternal aunt, and your grand madam was my maternal aunt. Due to generations of marital ties, I know you well. You lost your father early, relying on the upbringing of your grandmother and grand madam to become established. You long traveled to my father's door, and after completing your studies, my father thought you were worthy of marriage, so he married you to my elder sister. When you went out into the world, you befriended famous scholars from all over the country, gradually obtaining resources to support your elders and raise your children. Recently, my sister died due to difficulties in childbirth, and your grandmother also passed away last year. From then on, you were depressed and unhappy, fell ill, and medicine was ineffective. You withered away and died at the young age of thirty-seven. The grand madam is old, your younger siblings have not yet married, and you leave behind five children, the youngest of whom is just learning to walk. The future is long; who can care for them? Alas, Yucen, how could you die? You were naturally gifted with intelligence in your studies, and your poetry and prose were elegant and spirited. Your lyrics were especially skillful, moving between Qingzhen and Mengchuang. Even your calligraphy and painting were exquisite, circulating overseas and valued as much as Southern gold. Alas, it is difficult for Heaven to create talent, and yet it recklessly destroys and breaks it. I do not know what its intentions are. If you had been granted more years, then your literary talent and refined manners would undoubtedly be passed down to future generations. Alas, Yucen, how could you die? My father is old and often says that living in this world is suffering day by day. My mother died, my sister died. Reading my father's eulogies, I cannot help but weep. You regarded my father as your own, and I regarded you as my elder brother. We shared joys and sorrows, as close as blood relatives. Now, with tearful eyes, I approach the court, with no words of consolation. It is not only the Xie family's misfortune but also my family's misfortune. I wanted to learn from you, but you were humble and dared not accept. On stormy nights, we followed each other on the sea, and your arguments greatly opened my mind. Occasionally, when I created something, I would seek your polishing, and you would cut away its thorns and bestow upon it its beauty. From now on, who can I tell my bitter thoughts? Who will examine my scholarly doubts? Alas, Yucen, how could you die? You should never have died, and yet you did. However, I have always suspected your illness. There were three reasons. Your body was weak, medicine was more common than food, and you were brave in using yourself. Living by the sea, close to the market, dust accumulated on your desk. Occasionally, when you had a slight illness, your diet was not satisfactory, and at this time, your love of learning surpassed the past. You would often hold a book all day and night, your face turning red, without caring. This is one reason why you did not live long. After my sister died, you painfully recalled her, filling in lyrics and calling out to the lonely phoenix. In the past, you told people that you wanted to repay your father-in-law, so you would continue writing. You wanted to repay your wife, but who would not remarry? Alas, the hypocrisy of the world, they certainly all loved each other when they were alive. But as the years change and the scenery fades, how many can be like Zeng Shen, who never remarried? Alas, my Yucen, from beginning to end, you were affectionate. Worry can injure people, and it was to this extent. This is the second reason why you did not live long. You were loyal in planning for others. If someone asked for your writing, it would always exceed expectations. Guests came every day, and even when you were ill, you would force yourself to get up and talk at length, only stopping when you were exhausted. The guests would also not leave immediately. When you were seriously ill and returned home, you refused guests. On the eve of your death, you were still writing drafts for close friends, as if forgetting your illness. All of this was enough to deplete your vitality. This is the third reason why you did not live long. Alas, loving to learn, being deeply affectionate, and exhausting your loyalty to plan for others, having one of these is enough to invite illness. You combined them all in one body. How could you live long? I am also thirty years old this year. In middle age, I am injured by sorrow and joy, and I have not gained any knowledge. My withered body is just like yours. If I were to die, could I be as deeply moving as you, so that old friends throughout my life, hearing the bad news, seeing your remaining writings, thinking of your character, would cry together? If so, then Yucen could die, and I will not grieve for you again.</p>
<p>Du Juan comments: I have known Yucen for almost five years, admiring his talent, respecting his character, and having a very close relationship. When I heard of his death, I was suddenly struck by lightning and stood there woodenly for a long time. I wanted to cry with words, but I could not find a single phrase. Now I have obtained Mr. Qian's article, which is sincere and heartfelt, deeply understanding my heart, and can fill my sorrow.</p>
<h3>Lamenting Recluse Xie Yucen</h3>
<p>— (Fang Zichuan)</p>
<p>Life is like morning dew, short or long, left to the dust. Alas, you were a diligent scholar, full of learning and true feelings. I remember traveling to Shanghai, where we discussed and shared evenings together. You had talent but were not met by the times, cramped and living in this body. You only thought of doing things to support yourself and did not admire the life of an official. The fragrance of your writing still remains (you recently wrote couplets for me, your brushstrokes were still strong), and the traces on the yellow tomb are still new. The phoenix and crane fly far away. I doubt that the dreams were from a past life. Last year, in the first month of winter, you fell ill and came to ask for advice. After parting, I felt lonely. Where can I find the respected wine? I ask Heaven, but Heaven does not speak. I still sit with lingering pain.</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Thirteenth Episode: It's Difficult to Marry Off, But One Pities Selling Oneself; Serving as a Commodity Is Also Joyful, Declaring Bankruptcy and Discussing Farming</p>
<p>So he slowly sipped a cup of tea, letting him slowly reach out to take the teapot, then slowly take a teacup and place it in front of him, the water poured into the cup rumbling, and it took a long time to fill the cup. A lot of time was wasted during this period. Yueying stood blankly by the corner of the table, wondering what was going on. So, when everyone ignored him, he had no choice but to turn around and sit on a chair opposite him. This chair was directly across from Wang Beihai. He felt this was a bit inconvenient, so he immediately turned around and sat facing the door. He didn't know if Beihai did it on purpose, or if it was just a coincidence, but Beihai coughed twice in a row at this time. Yueying immediately thought that he must have turned around too quickly and that his appearance was wrong, making him unhappy. So he turned his head a second time to look at Beihai. Originally, when he turned his head back the first time, Beihai felt that his behavior was too obvious, making it very embarrassing. Now that he had sat down and was looking at him again, it especially showed that he was doing it intentionally. Beihai looked at Zhiqian with a flushed face. Only then did Zhiqian suddenly realize that they were interested in each other, but it didn't belong to that aspect. During Beihai's days of diligent study, he really shouldn't have paid attention to women. Especially a woman like Zhu Yueying, she wasn't a person, she was a commodity of his grandmother and mother, whoever wanted this commodity had to pay the equivalent price. Beihai wasn't one of those masters who could afford to buy people. In this initial thought, he should have broken it off. (205)</p>
<h3>The Records of Floating Fragrances from the Imperial Palace</h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The third command came from the mouth of the eunuch:</p>
<p>"Stand straight!" This was to make them imitate what the sea dragon had just done, standing upright with their buttocks as the center of gravity, like a person sitting on the ground; while their red tongues were still stretching and shrinking. Of course, not all of these dogs could stand straight quickly and gracefully. Several puppies that had not been trained for long had to be urged and helped by the eunuch in charge of the dogs, so that they could stand as neatly as the other dogs; and only when all the dogs were standing straight would the eunuch shout the final command:</p>
<p>"Bow to the Old Buddha!" The effect of this command was truly beyond my expectation! The dogs barked at the same time and put their two front legs together, shaking them up and down, as if bowing to the Empress Dowager: this scene was truly wonderful, and I have never seen such well-trained dogs elsewhere. However, this made me greatly suspicious of the special favor that the sea dragon received: at this moment, except for being able to move like the other dogs, it had no other skills to show. Why did the Empress Dowager favor it so much? This was another strange thing that was extremely difficult to understand! Or it could be said that it was because it had many golden bells tied around its neck, which could make sounds at all times, so it could make the Empress Dowager pay special attention to it; but this was not a sufficient reason. In my opinion, it was a jester in the palace, who could easily make the Empress Dowager laugh. (315)</p>

<h3>The Vitality of National Goods</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Recently, I have three thoughts on national goods:</p>
<p>First, the factories that produce national goods are realizing that, in this situation, they can only survive and gain a foothold through cooperation with others in the same industry. Therefore, the current trend among factories is (1) unity within the industry, (2) enriching content, (3) focusing on sales, and (4) striving to improve products and reduce costs. This is a good sign for the national goods industry. I am afraid that it would not have reached this point without this hardship. As the saying goes, "Hardship and adversity lead to success," which seems to be true.</p>
<p>Second, genuine efforts to promote national goods: The weather is hot, and summer products are on the market. Recently, one company used a foreign fan. People noticed it. The shopkeeper was embarrassed and eventually replaced it with a Huasheng fan. The waiters in ordinary restaurants, when picking up wine, offer either Shanghai beer or Chinese beer. In their simple minds, they only think of getting small copper coins. They don't think about whether it is a national good or not. However, knowledgeable and patriotic friends should drink Yantai beer brewed by Liquan to feel at ease. This is the genuine effort to promote national goods.</p>
<p>Third, the basic strategy to save national goods: Recently, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, based on Mr. Hu Xiyuan's proposal, requested the Ministry of Finance to revise the tariff regulations, gradually increasing import taxes on foreign goods that can be replaced by national goods, so that their selling prices do not fall below the selling prices of national goods. This is the fundamental strategy to save national goods. It is worth studying and promoting. I hope the government will resolutely implement it. If it becomes a reality, then its effect will be ten times greater than providing loans for relief.</p>
<h3>The Grand Occasion of the National Exhibition Held by the Ministry of Industry</h3>
<p>— Sun Chouchu</p>
<p>The Spring National Goods Exhibition held by the National Goods Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Industry started on the first of this month and will end on the 20th. Chouchu, along with over a hundred Shanghai manufacturers' representatives, including Shen Zhicheng, went to participate. I will now record what I heard and saw:</p>
<p>The venue is located east of Huaiqing Bridge in the capital, at the former site of the weaving office of the former Qing Dynasty, which is very spacious. Jiankang Road in front of the gate has also recently been widened, so although there are many tourists, it is not crowded. There are three gates along Jiankang Road for entry and exit. Each gate has a towering, colorful archway, pasted with slogans such as "Using national goods is saving the country and saving yourself" and "Buying one more national good is leaving one more point of vitality for the country." At the opening ceremony, Zhang Yiou, a technical supervisor of the Ministry of Industry, said that although the four words "promote national goods" are an old topic and an old article, it seems that people have long been accustomed to hearing them and do not take them seriously. In fact, if one does not want to save the country and save the people, then so be it. Otherwise, one must practice it in person. He also explained in detail the advantages and disadvantages of gold being expensive and silver being cheap, and silver being expensive and gold being cheap, saying that if the leaks are not stopped, no matter what, it will inevitably turn into anemia and become incurable. His words were earnest and deeply touched the current currency situation. When Lu Xingzhuang and Ma Jisheng of the Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation spoke, Lu pointed out that there were crude and shoddy products in various industries, resulting in meaningless price competition, leading to mutual destruction. He requested the government to devise a method to control them, so as to eliminate their harm. Ma advocated that public officials take the lead in promoting national goods, so that the wind would blow and the grass would bend, achieving twice the result with half the effort. He requested the government to pay special attention. When Mr. Zhang gave his thanks, he was willing to accept and implement the above two points. The hall was pasted with eight statistical tables of the import of tobacco and alcohol, the import of foreign wheat, the import of important agricultural products, and the import of cosmetics from various countries in recent years. It also hung a distribution map of national Chinese goods companies across the country, made by the China National Goods Production and Sales Cooperation Association, divided into three types: already opened, under preparation, and planned to be established. Designated locations were marked with symbols. Jiangsu Province planned to set up the most, including Shanghai, Nanjing, Bojiang, Songjiang, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Tongzhou, Yangzhou, Xuzhou, Tongshan, and other places. The exhibition hall was to the right of the auditorium. Samples from various provinces and cities across the country were sent here. A total of 6,523 items were collected this time. Educational items were the most numerous, totaling 1,694 items. Other items were divided into eight categories: dyeing and weaving industry, food and art, mineral products, medicine, manufacturing technology, chemical industry, clothing, agriculture and forestry, and were categorized and stored in glass cabinets for people to visit. The temporary sales locations, totaling 124, were to the left of the auditorium. Temporary sheds were built. Places like Beijing, Hangzhou, Hunan, Guangdong, Pingmin, and Lu all came. There were as many as 84 companies from Shanghai. The stalls were arranged side by side, and the layouts were all hooked and angled. The advertisement for the 128 Battlefield set up by the Guanshengyuan Food Company was the most eye-catching, depicting the scenery of Zhabei, with soldiers holding guns and charging forward. It contained moving mechanisms that were lifelike. There were dozens of planes hanging down with lines, and by opening a few mechanisms, they could fly in the wind. An officer held binoculars in his left hand and pointed to the enemy in his right hand, which could also move. The advertisement contained patriotic ideas, which were enough to inspire people. It can be called ingenious. Chairman Lin and President Wang visited one after another, praising it greatly, and each purchased many goods to promote it.</p>
<h3>News About Changing Paper for School Books</h3>
<p>— Xuyuan</p>
<p>Students taking an oath to use national goods before the new year is truly a major movement. Currently, all schools have started with clothing, adopting national goods to make school uniforms. Each primary school student pays a school uniform fee of two or three yuan. The fabric factory's business has been boosted as a result. However, the issue of changing to Chinese paper for reading materials is still under investigation by the Federation. Because a student group sent a letter to the Federation asking which textbooks were printed with Chinese paper, the Federation had nothing to answer. Therefore, Tian Xu Wosheng, in his individual capacity, sent letters to the four major bookstores, Commercial Press, Zhonghua Book Company, World Book Company, and Datong Book Company, making a contribution to the authorities. The original letter said, "Yesterday, a primary school student submitted an article to Shenbao's 'Spring and Autumn Snippets,' saying, 'Will the textbooks for the next semester be changed to Chinese paper, or will they still use foreign paper? I think this question is easily resolved. Just note it on the copyright page, so that it can be distinguished and calculated in wholesale. The format is as follows:</p>
<p>Elementary School Chinese Language Book, Volume X</p>
<p>Newsprint printed at a price of one dime, plus four cents</p>
<p>According to this method, if the original wholesale price is six cents at a 40% discount, the school sells it for seven cents, earning one cent. Now, four cents are added to the price, and it is sold for eleven cents without discount, still earning one cent. Each primary school student buys at most ten books, which only increases the burden by forty cents, and the outflow of profits can be completely recovered. Any book can be carried out according to this ratio.'" This draft has not yet been published. It was actually submitted by Xuyuan's grandson, Keqi, on behalf of him. The first article in issue 116 of the Machinery Federation Journal also published an article titled "Seeing Childhood and the National Goods Movement." The calculation method in it also includes discounts in the increased price. However, newsprint is now cheaper than before. Assuming that each ream of 32-open, 36-page is two yuan and six jiao, each book costs less than five li for the paper. If using Suxi Mao Bian, each six-open page costs seven li, so 36 pages cost two fen and five li for the paper. The difference is only two fen. So adding a price of four fen, although the printing cost is high, it can still be done without hindrance. However, in the ordinary psychology, people are shocked by the huge difference in paper prices, thinking that it cannot be recovered. But in fact, people's hearts are trending, almost like Han Yong's: if it is decided to flow east, it will flow east; if it is decided to flow west, it will flow west. Textbooks are not like leisure books. They each have a copyright, and the first to enter the market wins. In this transitional period, there seem to be great differences in imports and exports. Therefore, I do not hesitate to boldly ask you to print some with Chinese paper when printing the books for the next semester, so that patriots will not have money but no place to buy them. If foreign paper can be bought on credit and Chinese paper needs to be paid in cash, then adopt the production and sales cooperation method and use acceptance bills, which can benefit both sides. Although our factory's paper output is only a drop in the ocean, it can also help with a basket of soil. Walking far starts from the low, and climbing high starts from the near. I humbly hope that you will have a broad vision and use your ability to reverse the situation, so that recovering the outflow of profits and saving domestic industry and commerce will be as easy as turning over a hand. Please do not hate me for being verbose. If there are any concerns, do not be ashamed to ask. Please call to make an appointment to discuss them. I am looking forward to it very much." He also attached a copy of issue 116 of the Machinery Federation Journal. The paper used is Xinyi paper from the Utilization Factory, 31×43 costing seven yuan and five jiao per ream, each page costing four li and seven hao. If using newspaper, adding one fen and two li, etc. From this point of view, it seems that it is possible to realize. Each papermaking machine can supply paper to at least 30 printing presses. If the four major bookstores adopt it unanimously, then the future of Chinese paper mills can be greatly developed, and the raw materials for papermaking in the interior will also have a large outlet. It is truly a move that prepares for several benefits.</p>
<h3>Love Blood and Love National Goods</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>If a child in the family accidentally falls and injures their hands and feet or breaks their head, and blood is flowing non-stop! Parents should feel very heartbroken and loving! They should quickly take styptic medicine and gauze to bandage them! Blood! Is the treasure of the human body! In the "Spring and Autumn" column of this newspaper, Hua Lingjun wrote a short article titled "Blood," which is very correct. He said: "If blood and money are one and the same, then it can be established that we should love blood, then we should love money, and if we love money, then we should love blood! Using foreign goods and letting money flow out is like letting our blood flow out! Leaving this blood, we can make the country rich and strong. So here, I wish everyone to cherish all blood and not let it flow away lightly."</p>
<p>Compatriots! Loving national goods is loving your own blood! Then, to maintain the blood that connects your own life, use national goods and reject imported goods, you should work even harder!</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Domestic Student Supplies Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Yun Sun</p>
<p>The academic year is the domestic goods year! Time flies, and four full months have passed in a blur, which is one-third of the year. What is the effect of its promotion? We dare not casually compliment it, away from reality. Although there was a domestic student supplies exhibition when the city's students held a swearing-in ceremony, the time was too short, and the understanding of the city's students was one-sided and not widespread. Recently, the United Association for the Promotion of Domestic Student Goods requested the leaders to hold a temporary discussion at the Tongji Vocational School in Jiangwan to organize a domestic student supplies exhibition. This is noteworthy because it starts from the education sector itself. On the opening day (i.e., May 3rd), I took a car to visit. The venue was in the auditorium of Tongji Vocational School, which was the former site of the National Labor University. Therefore, although it is a secondary school, the auditorium is quite magnificent. The area is also very wide, and the decorations at the entrance are quite educational and artistic. At a glance, one immediately imagines the decorations for school parent-teacher conferences and commemorative meetings. Holding a student supplies exhibition in the school auditorium can achieve twice the result with half the effort. Inside, there are layers of interconnected national circles. Around the circles are the stalls of participating manufacturers. There are Girl Scouts, security groups, and police officers maintaining order in the venue. There are more than a dozen manufacturers with sales departments. From the perspective of students' purchases, of course, stationery and sports equipment come first, followed by cotton fabrics, yarns, clothing, and fabrics. As for cosmetics, they are not necessary, only giving students an impression. There are not many toys on display, scattered like stars. On the other hand, there are medicinal products. Although we humans inevitably face the troubles of "gathering firewood," we certainly don't need so many, simply occupying the venue's area. There are two pieces of household appliances, which are worth displaying, leaving a shadow for the female students when they become housewives. For example, the economical oil stove does not require inflation or alcohol. In addition to cooking, it can also be used as an iron. The quality of several manufacturers' soaps is also not bad.</p>
<p>It is said that all the designs in the exhibition are the result of the cooperation between the teachers and students of Tongji and Xinmin schools, which is a comforting manifestation of "unity of knowledge and action." We also hope that similar exhibitions in China will solicit more products from vocational schools and agricultural schools made by the students themselves. This time, only a few products from the Lida Academy Farm were seen, which is a rare occurrence. In the moment I visited, although it was as crowded as a tide, I only saw some elementary school students lining up and walking around in order, which seemed to give them too little understanding. This kind of "sheep-herding, cattle-driving" visit should be reformed. At the same time, the authorities of the four major universities and middle schools should take responsibility and urge students to attend and appreciate the exhibition because they are independent buyers, unlike elementary school students who only retain impressions. Finally, let me introduce their six slogans: (1) We students are pioneers in using domestic goods! (2) We must encourage the entire society to use domestic goods! (3) We must promote the manufacturing of domestic goods! (4) We must promote the sales of domestic goods! (5) Using domestic goods cultivates national strength! (6) Using domestic goods solves the problem of people's livelihoods!</p>
<h3>Students' Clothing Issues</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>A friend of mine jokingly said, "An inland student, when he first comes to the city, always wears a long gown made of homespun cloth and shoes made of rough cloth. A few months later, although the long gown is still a long gown, the material is not right. It's either serge or gabardine, and he's wearing a pair of leather boots. A few months later, his whole body changes, and Chinese clothing becomes Western clothing. They want to be fashionable and beautiful, so they change and change again. Who knows that this change makes foreign merchants smile, while domestic merchants suffer badly." Another friend complained, "It's as difficult as asking them to take their lives to get female students in the city to buy a few reference books. However, when they make fashion or buy cosmetics, they always choose expensive foreign goods. I really don't know what kind of mentality they have."</p>
<p>Although these two people's conversations seem a bit extreme, they are not entirely unfounded. As I see it, "love of beauty" is human nature, especially in adolescence. However, it is extremely wrong to forget the foundation of the country for the sake of beauty. On this point, I have two suggestions below:</p>
<p>One is radical, that is, all students in the country should be militarized, uniformly wearing school uniforms made of domestic goods; otherwise, they will not be allowed to enter the school. For women, advocate "healthy beauty," and do not accept female students who wear makeup. Although this method seems quick, it may be too hasty, and young people may not approve of it.</p>
<p>The second is gradual, that is, whether you wear a Western suit or Chinese clothing, the material must be domestic. Whether you wear powder or rouge, it is best not to buy foreign goods. This point is probably approved by everyone, but whether they will absolutely abide by it is another question worth discussing.</p>
<p>Students! Patriotism is a matter of conscience, and it is absolutely voluntary and does not require coercion. I hope that the two issues mentioned above will not be implemented, and everyone will unite to promote it themselves.</p>

<h3>The Style of Short Essays</h3>
<p>— Qin Wen</p>
<p>In general novels, for the sake of being "concrete," the author probably does not directly express opinions. In terms of style, it is "single narration." If there are opinions, they are always expressed indirectly, spoken through the mouths of "characters," written as letters, or compiled as diaries. Short essays do not have to be like this. If there are opinions, they can be expressed directly and happily.</p>
<p>However, short essays are also different from general argumentative essays. Ordinary argumentative essays should not have too much narrative about facts, which can only occupy a small part of the article. Short essays can be arbitrary. If it is a sketch, it is okay to have the entire article be a narrative from beginning to end, and pure descriptive "plain drawing" can also be used.</p>
<p>In this way, "argumentation" and "narration" can be juxtaposed, and can be used arbitrarily everywhere. The author is very free, like the "miscellaneous essays" in ancient prose. Miscellaneous essays are "mixed narration and argumentation," which can be roughly divided into three types: The first type is narrating a paragraph and then arguing a paragraph, such as Su Shi's "Sun Metaphor"; the second type is narrating the facts entirely and then adding argumentation, such as Han Yu's "Biography of Carpenter Wang Chengfu" and Wu Minshu's "On Fishing"; the third type is starting with a paragraph of argumentation, such as Liu Zongyuan's "Three Admonitions." Among them, no matter which type, the narration is always more than the argumentation. Short essays are also like this. It's just that there are very few purely narrative miscellaneous essays, while short essays have a "sketching" way, which is the difference in similarity.</p>
<p>Novels still emphasize single narration and description, and the author's intention is only expressed implicitly. Because the length is not limited, it can be portrayed in many ways, so it is okay to "imply." It is also necessary to deliberately not say it clearly, but only imply it, in order to satisfy the reader's "desire for creation." The length of short essays is limited. If they also emphasize single narration and implication like novels, I am afraid that they will not be expressed thoroughly, and readers will not be able to understand them clearly, inevitably feeling baffled.</p>
<p>Precisely because they are clearly expressed, direct, and happy, and easy to understand, readers always welcome short essays more than novels. The advantage of short essays, in addition to being simple and clear, lies in being straightforward and happy. Of course, it must be written appropriately to achieve this.</p>
<p>In fact, recent novels, in order to be easily popularized and encourage readers, must also explain the events and reasons clearly and plainly. It's just that it is necessary to take the characters being written as the main body and add various explanations to the narration invisibly, which is very difficult to do. Like the mixed narration and argumentation of miscellaneous essays, this saves effort and is easy to achieve results. Then, the prevalence of short essays at present is certainly gratifying, but also natural!</p>
<h3>Cherry Blossoms</h3>
<p>— Xiang Shan</p>
<p>Days of spring rain, days of spring sorrow, in that misty rain, the sorrow of crossing the ocean and being stained with the spring colors of the South seeps through. This kind of sorrow is just like the yellow winter jasmine on the fence, drooping listlessly in the spring rain.</p>
<p>Holding a paper umbrella, I slipped through the alley. The alley was shrouded in drizzle, as if dissolved in milky softness. At the end of the alley, the dimly lit café played a tune that was out of tune, and the red paper cherry blossoms decorating the entrance were like the women here who treat night as day, with their colors fading from youthful rosy.</p>
<p>Seeing these faded cherry blossoms made me long for the cherry trees in the botanical garden being washed by the spring rain. By the pond filled with tadpoles, bearing the shadows of the old trees and hills above, and lonely watching their own posture reflected in the water, the cherry blossoms blooming so delicately.</p>
<p>Longing for these cherry blossoms that had not yet been ruined and faded by the wind and rain, I held a paper umbrella and went to the botanical garden as if swimming in a space of mellow wine.</p>
<p>What came into my eyes was dazzling new green. Whether it was the violets, dandelion leaves, and weeds on the ground, or the willows, camellias, and Himalayan cypresses standing in the air, or the clusters of holly planted on the hills, all contained the vitality of life at the most fleeting moment, breaking through the soil layer, breaking through the rain net, showing the great power of unlimited development.</p>
<p>The cherry blossoms were dotted with rosy red in the middle of the new green—nature often paints a harmonious picture. This is like the perfect work of a craftsman, not only matching the charming colors, but also giving it the kinetic energy of growth. Although there was no fragrance in a patch of cherry forest, that kind of pure emotion gave people a feeling that was even more fragrant and beautiful. Originally, for a lonely young person, the greatest charm was not so much rich as it was simple, because this is harmonious and harmonious.</p>
<p>Climbing up the slightly high hill, I could see the smoke from the city's chimneys, pressed down by the rain, crawling like silk or cotton across the eaves of people's houses. The environment in the botanical garden was dissolved in a peaceful and calm liquid, while the row of alleys outside the wall were annoyed by the relentless raindrops seeping through the roofs.</p>
<p>I recalled that in the place where I now stood, two or three hundred years ago, it was the palace of General Tokugawa, who controlled the three islands with the greatest military force. However, times have changed, and now, although one can still see cinnamon trees and various famous herbs from the medicine garden at that time as relics in this garden, aren't the descendants of the general, who was so prominent in his time, also whistling through troubled days, leaving this palace, dreaming back to the glory of the past, and letting white hair erode youth! I cannot feel sadness, I am enlightened by the great power of the times, although, I am still somewhat saddened by another kind of people whose faces are lined with frost in today's world.</p>
<p>Behind the hill was a patch of lush green grass, flourishing and spreading on the slightly warm soil. On this grassland, many small houses surrounded by red and white striped curtains were built, where the mellow aroma of wine and drunken words that forgot the ways of the world floated. Young, old, and even children sat in the small houses, all clapping their hands to the rhythm, singing folk songs and old tunes, pouring wine into their stomachs like boiling water. Although this kind of drunken, crazy豪態 is reminiscent of the ancient Tang Dynasty's spring outings, I felt sadness in their joy.</p>
<p>The reason for this enjoyment is not so much to appreciate the full-blooming cherry blossoms and pour out their grievances on the family, but rather to numb the pain with wine! They used wine to act a little crazy, forgetting the demons of reality completely. Even if the wine cup was emptied and the cherry blossoms filling the eyes invaded the moonlight, and the whole year's troubles were temporarily separated, what kind of taste will you feel after you wake up from the wine! Trivial dreams for those who indulge in temporary pleasure, you will forever be the cows and horses of this world.</p>
<p>I sadly shifted my eyes to the small pond. Although I was saddened by the pain of others, I also felt that I was trapped in the same fate. A gust of wind blew in the drizzle, and raindrops stained my sleeves. I suspected that my tears had soaked my collar. At this time, the small pond rippled with gentle waves, slowly expanding. A crow was stretching its neck in the water, and encountering a slight breeze, several cherry petals fell on its body. As if startled, it swam two steps, and the cherry petals that fell on its body fluttered and fell on the water, and the duck pecked at them with its thick yellow beak.</p>
<p>Cherry blossoms often bring me some pitiful melancholy. This year, in the cherry blossom season, I saw these drunkards who forgot the ways of the world. Last year, I saw the pitiful circus girl under the double cherry blossoms of the Yasukuni Shrine.</p>
<p>It was also in April, at the Yasukuni Shrine on Kudan behind the Imperial Palace, that a grand military festival was held. Fireworks pierced the night sky, torches burned through the darkness, and waves of people surged towards the main hall, kneeling to worship the spirits of the soldiers who died in battle. On both sides of the large square in front of the shrine, many temporary amusement parks were set up. I slipped past the tents where the disabled veterans were sitting and arrived at the square in front of the shrine. Although all the chaotic sounds covered my nerves, the figures of the sallow-faced disabled veterans would never leave my memory. I was pushed and pushed by the waves of people to a lively circus. Next to the trough, a girl painted snow-white, with two jet-black eyes, gazed at the sky—the child was as thin as a monkey. I followed the child's gaze and also gazed at the sky. It turned out that another cluster of double cherry blossoms in full bloom was shining in the firelight. I thought, this poor child is recalling the spring colors of her hometown, recalling the cherry blossoms blooming on her old fence, no! She doesn't have such leisure. She is praying that in a moment, she will not fall from the horse and encounter harm! In this way, the child's pitiful posture, like the double cherry blossoms, will forever remain in my heart.</p>
<p>At this time, a crow soaked in the rain chirped on the camellia tree opposite, which shattered my memories. I looked at myself, and although the paper umbrella was still in my hand, my whole body was wet from the rain. And the paper umbrella was still speckled with cherry petals.</p>
<p>So, I finally left the botanical garden with a sentimental heart and a body full of rain.</p>
<h3>Who Put the Center of the Water Margin in Yunzhou? (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Ling Mo</p>
<p>Luo Guanzhong, the editor of Water Margin, had his registered residence in Dongyuan, which is very close to Yunzhou. However, recent textual research based on notes has questioned it. What is now believed is that Luo Guanzhong was from Hangzhou or Taiyuan. The Hangzhou theory is probably only because Shi Nai'an was from Hangzhou, and it was entangled along with it, and there may not be any basis. The geographical records in Water Margin, from Daming in the north to Jizhou in the south, and Dongchang in the east and west, are quite accurate in terms of mileage and dates. Jizhou, Qingzhou, and Tokyo are not very reliable, and the records of Jiankang, Wuwei, and Jiangzhou in the south of the Yangtze River are simply vague. How could this come from the hands of a southerner? Saying that he was from Taiyuan has fewer problems, but it is a bit strange for a Taiyuan person to take the distant Yunzhou Water Margin instead of the nearby Taihang Mountains. Moreover, the journey records of Lu Zhishen from Huayin to Mount Wutai to Qinglong Mountain do not seem to be written by a Shanxi person. Therefore, I feel that it is more stable to textual research Luo Guanzhong, and temporarily not textual research Dongyuan. As for the question of why, if Dongyuan Luo Guanzhong can be acknowledged, he would want to promote a man from Qiantang to take himself seriously, it can probably be speculated that at that time the Hangzhou version had authority on the edition, or increased the material, some of which was taken from the Hangzhou version of the novel.</p>
<p>The geography in Water Margin can be used as the basis for inferring the author's place of origin, and the language in Water Margin can also be helpful in this regard. With these two direct research materials, and with hundreds of thousands of words about Water Margin textual research now available, we still have not solved the author's place of origin, which really cannot but make us suspect the methods used by textual researchers.</p>
<p>In the past, the material in Water Margin itself that textual research paid attention to mainly concerned the increase of stories. But it also placed too much emphasis on the post-Luo version and neglected the pre-Luo version. Of course, the material is really too little. But the various points that differ between Water Margin and the Yihou Anecdotes are also lacking in analysis. For example, although Anecdotes does not mention the hometowns of each person, it can generally be seen that there are no southerners, and there is no story of Song Jiang being exiled to Jiangzhou. Then, the story of Song Jiang going to the south and bringing many southerners to Liangshan must have been created by southerners. It was uniformly added to the Water Margin grand collection. What provides the basis for it may be the Zaju plays, or stories from the same source as the Zaju plays or published in Hangzhou—or even the Song Jiang mentioned by Lang Ying.</p>
<p>Not only are the seventy-two lesser heroes added later from all over the world, but the activity locations of some of the already established characters among the major heroes have also been dispersed to all directions. Although Li Kui's origin as a Shandong person has not been changed, his origin has been moved to Jiangzhou. There are also traces to be found of Shi Jin's transformation from a Dongping garrison commander to a Huayin young master. The situations of important characters in Water Margin with ten-chapter qualifications, such as Lu Zhishen in Mount Wutai, Shi Xiu in Jizhou, and Lu Junyi in Daming, should also be as above. Perhaps the various ten-chapter stories originally circulated in different places, and were finally collected in one place.</p>
<p>Just as the public would be happy that Meng Jiangnu came from their local area, it is also possible that they would be happy that Wu Song came from their local area. From Wu Song's tomb in Hangzhou, we can still imagine how people in various places connected the Water Margin characters with their local areas. There are many Water Margin characters, so it does not seem to have caused a situation where two places compete for one person, but each place must have regarded the person they told stories about as being in a very high position on Liangshan. Perhaps if Water Margin was not written by a person from western Shandong, Song Jiang's leadership position would have been shaken. This is enough to show that the center of Water Margin falling in Yunzhou was originally accidental. On the one hand, the author wanted to achieve his center, and on the other hand, he was restricted by local legends, so he showed a state of being unable to cope with the situation, which is not very worthy of our attention?</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Singer</h3>
<p>— Bai Lai</p>
<p>The artistic tendency of an author is essentially determined by the forms of life surrounding him. However, the social organism is constantly evolving, and the change in the forms of life that constitute an author's artistic view will inevitably lead to an absolute disharmony with the author's subjective artistic view. Those with a progressive worldview will naturally turn with the direction of the times, making up for the shortcomings between the two. But those who have no trust in the future become stubborn supporters of the "past." Literary "yesterday's singers" are often formed in this way.</p>
<p>Once art falls into the hands of these "yesterday's singers" who value themselves above all else, it will no longer exist for the purpose of critiquing life and serving humanity; rather, it will be reduced to merely being a companion in the palace of his individual soul. Therefore, every "yesterday's singer," except for unconditionally indulging in those dead golden days, has always disdained the turbulent century before his eyes.</p>
<p>Here, let's take Ivan Bunin as an example:</p>
<p>"From poverty and loneliness,</p>
<p>I walked out of my hometown,</p>
<p>Wandering in the world,</p>
<p>But I often remember that childhood.</p>
<p>Childhood was spent on the prairie, in the hollows, in the fields;</p>
<p>It was also spent among the barren hills similar to this avenue.</p>
<p>Silent, the childhood of many people,</p>
<p>But in the desolate wilderness, for no reason</p>
<p>Prospered; I'm afraid it's not just prospered once, is it?</p>
<p>When I think of that era, I feel sad.</p>
<p>But how can I forget my hometown?"</p>
<p>(Borrowed from Fang Guangtao's translation)</p>
<p>Bunin cherishes his past so much that he is unwilling to turn his "reviewing" eyes to the front. Therefore, he believes that the "prosperity" of "many people's childhood" is "for no reason"; he knows nothing about reality. On the contrary, even the "sad" past that he "feels sad" cannot be "forgotten." Even for this reason, he is willing to sing a dirge for himself:</p>
<p>"Let the world's fortune move,</p>
<p>We silently pass away…</p>
<p>Soon our sunset will disappear, right?</p>
<p>But the new sun is also near, and that sunlight will reveal a smile,</p>
<p>Shining on other people, right?"</p>
<p>(Excerpt from the same translation)</p>
<p>However, such a fate will not only be shared by Bunin alone, but by every "yesterday's singer"!</p>
<h3>"Man and God"</h3>

<h3>Trivial Matters at Dusk (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Shao Guanhua</p>
<p>— Oh, so this is my residence from half a month ago!</p>
<p>Thinking that this was the place where I used to sleep every night, I felt an unusual warmth. But now, unconsciously walking past it, wandering past it, I feel an inexplicable sense of loss in my heart.</p>
<p>— If there's a chance, maybe I'll come back to sleep here again. However, in a life of hardship and busyness, even if something brings me across the river, it will be fleeting. Who knows what day or month it will actually happen?</p>
<p>The car moved on, already twenty feet away from the old residence. Its shadow had completely disappeared, and I still missed it warmly and with a hint of melancholy.</p>
<p>Soon the car pulled up to a river shrouded in the night. The river water stirred gently, as if whispering.</p>
<p>Five feet away from the river, several towering electric poles stood tall. The electric lights emitted a golden dragon-like glow, illuminating the intersection of Pingyue Road, not overly bright.</p>
<p>— Hmm, I haven't walked this road in five days. This road still harmonizes with the riverside night, making people feel slightly annoyed, yet not disappointed, standing there.</p>
<p>— How great, will this road be able to exist like this forever?</p>
<p>I sighed.</p>
<p>The long white cloth advertisement curtain at the intersection was moved by the wind, revealing the tobacco shop where I often went to buy cigarettes half a month ago.</p>
<p>Looking over, the middle-aged and chubby shop owner who often greeted me was sleeping.</p>
<p>— Business is probably slow? Otherwise, at this early hour, he wouldn't be enjoying the pleasure of sleep. I continued to think.</p>
<p>The car turned into the alley on the left. The four words "Xiaoxiao Bookstore" suddenly came to my memory.</p>
<p>"Xiaoxiao Bookstore" is not far from here, opened by my newly acquainted friend Mr. Fu. I wonder how business has been recently? Mr. Fu is a lively, talkative, and "masculine" new writer. He took on this job in his spare time from writing, which I found particularly interesting. I heard a few days ago that he caught a cold from swimming and became ill. I also went to see him once with Mr. Jiang around the same time at dusk. His haggard face still emitted a passionately loud voice like a bell. I think he will easily recover his talkativeness. On this dark and misty road, I sincerely wish him a speedy recovery!</p>
<p>After the car took me to another place to buy some things, it still took me through the dark cobblestone road, leading me to the riverside.</p>

<h3>Financial Swap Gold Market Mediocre, Once Broke Through 7,000 Yuan, Result Only Fell 1.6 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the last trading day for the June gold market. Trading in the market began to roll over, and people's minds were unsettled. Trading was normal, resulting in a rather mediocre half-day market. Although it fell due to a sharp rise in foreign [markets?], the [price?] still...</p>
<p>The US exchange rate stabilized, and the internal market was stable. The morning opened with a consistent rise in overseas silver markets. However, large players said it would soften after the close, with deals below the closing price. The Montreaux forward silver price narrowed by nearly two and a half, with the forward premium rising by 1.6 to 1.8. The exchange rate opened narrow and closed long. London spot gold rose by 2 pence. Although people were tired, there was a lack of supply at low prices, resulting in pre-market trading opening only [lower?]. The standard gold price fell to 825.9 yuan, and the pre-swap had retreated to within 1.5 yuan, then fell to 723 yuan. The morning opened lower. After the opening, buyers flocked to buy on the dip, and banks also rushed to make settlements, tightening the exchange market, which immediately rose. The Central Bank took advantage of the high price to sell US dollars. It was learned that HSBC Bank's listing of the British [pound?] rose by 125 and the US [dollar?] rose by 375, hindering the rise and causing a downturn. At this time, demand and supply were normal, and the situation hovered for quite some time. The formal swap market opened, and the price fell to a buyer's premium of 2.2 yuan. People's minds were not encouraged. After entering [the market?], there was a lack of maintenance, and selling prevailed, once breaking through the 70 yuan mark. However, because the exchange market was very stable, it was soon pulled up. There were not many transactions in the market, and the situation was vague. Finally, with importers making settlements in US dollars, buying sentiment recovered, and the market stabilized again at noon. The half-day situation was idle and vague, which is a normal phenomenon on a swap day. The future is still difficult to be certain. The June-to-July rollover premium ranged from a bull market premium of 2.2 yuan to 2.7 yuan. Here is a record of the half-day market situation:</p>
<p>The morning opened at 773 yuan, down 3 yuan from the previous close. Fuxing, Yongyingxiang, Dadecheng, and Hengyuchangda all made gains.

Sasoon suddenly had a buying appetite, and Yingxiang Huixiang Hengyu made gains, rebounding to 6.4 yuan. After entering [the market?], the swap fell again. Although Sasoon settled July first payment at 125, people's minds turned downward and it still fell. The formal swap market opened, retreating to a buyer's premium of 2.2 yuan. Hengyu Yuanmao Yongfuxingyong Yuqingyong sold off, falling below 4 yuan. Dadecheng Qianchangxiang Shunmao resold, breaking the 70 yuan mark, falling to 69.8 yuan. Hengxing Hengyuhui Xiang took advantage of the low to gain to 72.5 yuan. Guangdong sold 125 yuan of July US dollars, but it was difficult to sell. Mianxingyong sold, retreating to 70 yuan. At this time, there were many who took advantage of the low to limit gains, and they were still holding firm. Hengyu Richang Yuanchangyong Hui Xiang Yuanmao Yong Lianmei purchased. Zhengjin settled 125 yuan of July US dollars, rising to 4.2 yuan. Dafa Yongfuyu sold off, retreating to 2.7 yuan. Importers made some settlements, and Dada Fuxingyonglai made gains. The noon closing rebounded to 774.4 yuan. After the close, Dadecheng Dada Dingkang and others slightly purchased, rising above 5 yuan. The highest price during the half-day was 77 yuan 7.7 yuan, and the lowest price was 769.8 yuan, a difference of 7.99 yuan. The result fell 1.6 yuan from the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price was marked with the Central Bank's standard price, retreating to 825.9 yuan. In terms of the closing price, it was about 51 yuan less than the previous close of 2 yuan. This month's recorded price was 776 yuan, June's was 774 yuan, and July's was 771 yuan. The morning supplement was 776 yuan. The price of gold was about 10 yuan higher, at 773 yuan. The spot market was stable. Tianjin goods were about 12 yuan higher, and pure gold was about 15 yuan higher, but there was no movement. The swap (May-June) was offered by Shenkang to Shengda at 35 shares of 1.5 yuan. Only 210 shares of this month's coupon were left. The bulls Qianchangxiang had more than 100 shares, and Hengyu Yuanchangyong Dacheng Hengchang had a small amount of water. The bears Shengda had more than 100 shares, and Shenkang Yiyu Dingtai Dadecheng had a small amount. In total, there were 5 bulls and 5 bears. If public shares were removed, only 42 shares were left, with 2 bulls and 2 bears in total.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was extremely normal due to the influence of each number [brokerage?] in the futures market.

Huixiang, Yuqingyong, Shunmao, Hengchang, Yongfuxingyong, Chunyuan, Yongyu, Xinxiang, Futai, Hengyong, Dehongxingfu, Yu, etc. were on the selling side.

Hengxing had few transactions, with slight gains. The total number of transactions was 53,207 shares.</p>

Hengxing once posted a premium of 2.3 yuan. Fuyu Hengyu Yifeng Yongqing Fayongchangda Hanheng posted premiums one after another, immediately rising.

After the opening, Yicheng Hongxing posted premiums, and Dadecheng and Wanxing posted premiums, and the situation stabilized. Later, Hongxing Ruixing Huixiang Chunyuan Yong Dadecheng Qianyuan Yongshun and floating stocks posted premiums one after another, rising to 2.7 yuan. Yicheng Dachangxiang posted premiums, retreating to around 2.5 yuan. However, retail investors still came to post premiums. The noon closing was 2.7 yuan. After the close, Houchang Yong Hengyu Yicheng retail investors continued to post premiums, and Qianchangxiang posted premiums, rising to around 3 yuan.</p>

<h3>Although Chinese Merchants Dump Foreign Exchange, It Remains Stable Due to Importers Making Settlements</h3>
<p>According to foreign wire reports, the London market's large shares recently rose by 1.25 pence, and distant shares rose by 1.3125 pence. However, the ground floor reported softening after the market closed, with transactions said to be below the listed price. New York silver prices rose by 1.125 pence. Montreaux forward silver prices narrowed by 0.25 and rose by 1.8. London spot gold rose by 2 pence. British pounds against the US dollar fell by 0.75, the US dollar against the British pound rose by 0.25, and the British pound against the French franc fell by 12 basis points. The US dollar against the French franc remained unchanged. The exchange market opened in the morning with recent selling prices of 1 shilling 8.375 and 8.4375 pence to pair for British pounds and 41.3125 yuan for US dollars, which was a weakening of 0.625 for British pounds and a strengthening of 0.125 for US dollars compared to the previous close. The Central Bank's listing was announced, with a rise of 0.125 for British pounds and an increase of 0.25 for US dollars. The Customs gold unit fell by 0.09. The psychological state of Chinese merchants was still stable, and banks immediately came to make settlements, and the process tended to tighten. The Central Bank took advantage of the high price to slightly sell US dollars. It was learned that HSBC Bank's listing was announced, with a rise of 0.125 for British pounds and an increase of 0.375 for US dollars, and the process was finalized. Sassoon settled shillings and the market hovered. After entering [the market], although Chinese merchants came to sell, banks had a strong appetite, although it was strong, it was not much. Guangdong also sold US dollars, but banks still purchased on the cheap, and soon there was a turnaround. Importers also came to make settlements, and the US dollar process was still good, forcing the recent selling price in the afternoon to 1 shilling 8.3125 and 8.375 pence to pair for British pounds and 41.325 yuan for US dollars, which was a stabilization of the British and US exchange rates compared to the previous close. Chinese merchants such as Guangdong sold a total of about 300,000 yuan of US dollars. Sassoon settled gold bars. The Central Bank slightly sold US dollars. Importers made some settlements. Here is the half-day transaction record:</p>
<p>The British exchange market opened in the morning with recent selling prices of 1 shilling 8.375 and 8.4375 pence to pair.

<h3>The Silver Market is Quiet and the Discount Rate is Downstream</h3>
<p>Recently, the silver dollar market has not yet implemented relief loans, and it is difficult to arrange funds. Most peers are waiting and seeing, resulting in an increasingly quiet market situation. At this time, the silk and tea industries are about to be listed, but the interest rate on foreign exchange is declining, indicating that the financial stagnation has reached its extreme. Yesterday, the market interest rate on foreign exchange was 11 cents in the morning and afternoon, which was 1 cent lower than before. The overnight lending rate also remained unchanged. The volume of discount transactions was over 3.6 million in the morning and over 500,000 in new transactions. There were no transactions in the afternoon. The volume of transactions in the small exchange was over 600,000. The volume of foreign exchange mortgage transactions was over 300,000 for redemption and over 700,000 for new transactions. The volume of banknote transactions was over 1.4 million for redemption and over 500,000 for issuance of circulating notes. The volume of secret notes was over 700,000. The volume of remittances from various routes was over 400,000. The source of funds from other sources was 300,000, and 400,000 went out. The news of bank receipts of foreign currency was that foreign banks received over 2.8 million in foreign exchange bills, over 2.9 million in various collateral funds, over 500,000 in special remittances, over 800,000 in foreign exchange settlements, and 200,000 from warehouses.

Japanese banks received over 2.3 million in foreign exchange bills, over 3.3 million in various collateral funds, over 400,000 in special remittances, over 600,000 in foreign exchange settlements, and 600,000 from warehouses.

Also, yesterday, the price of Xiaoyang from Jiangnan fell 1.5 yuan in the morning, opening at 831 yuan, and rebounded 1.3 yuan in the afternoon, changing to 832.3 yuan. Therefore, the result was 0.2 yuan lower than before. The volume of transactions was 3,000 units in the morning and 10,000 units in the afternoon. The price of Guangdong Xiaoyang fell slightly by 0.3 yuan in the morning, opening at 731.9 yuan, and continued to fall slightly by 0.5 yuan in the afternoon, changing to 731.4 yuan. Therefore, the result was 0.8 yuan lower than before. The volume of transactions was 135,000 units in the morning and 40,000 units in the afternoon. The copper coin remained at 336,500 characters, the same as the previous day. The transaction amount was 46,110 strings of characters, with a total price of 14,000 foreign currency.

<h3>Securities: The Downturn of '96 Reappears, Rumors Spread, Falling Sharply by 0.6-0.7 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the situation in the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange fluctuated, gradually expanding, and people's minds mostly turned to emptiness. It was rumored that another 100 million yuan of bandit suppression bonds would be issued. In addition, the United States' silver purchase policy has stated that it will not change. It is a matter of expectation that silver prices will rise again. The rumor that 96 public bonds will not be auctioned in the market is rife. This rumor has been circulating for a long time, and it is uncertain whether it can be realized. However, it has been made clear that old shares can be delivered. It is found that the actual number of old shares is nearly 20 million, and the number of accounts in the exchange is 2.34 million. Those who have old shares will naturally deliver them, and those who do not have old shares will definitely try to exchange them to prepare for delivery. It is said that the counterfeit shares in the exchange are distinguished by the consignees themselves, which has caused panic. Many parties dare not accept the goods, and the over-the-counter market is also wary. Based on the speculation of the market situation, such as No. 48, who bought in the day before yesterday, has now spit out and has a short-selling trend. The northern gang and Nos. 4, 16, and 47 are also selling. Retail investors are entering and exiting abnormally, and the situation is chaotic. The future may be in line with the general prediction of 7 yuan. Due to the sudden increase in the number of chips in other bond markets, the financial industry will inevitably dump its inventories. The entire day yesterday was consistently weak. Because retail investors still have some appetite, the small amount is limited, and 96 has been sluggish. After breaking the 8 yuan mark in the afternoon, it has not been able to return. The situation is very difficult to be optimistic about. The reporter said early on that 96 will be eventful from now on. The current situation will not be calm until after the delivery of this month. The market price results yesterday were that most bonds fell slightly by 0.1 to 0.3 yuan, and 96 fell slightly by 0.6-0.7 yuan. The total transaction volume was 15,062,000 yuan, of which 96 accounted for as much as 7.75 million, still accounting for more than half of the total. The results of the increases and decreases are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market is Steady Amidst Quiet</h3>
<p>The yarn market is tending to be flat, and the situation is unusually quiet. Because the volume of transactions in the market has decreased and there is a lack of supply of chips, the market is showing a state of holding firm. However, most people are unanimously pessimistic. Only one bullish party, because its base is weak, buys low and increases its position, so the market price can still be supported. The average prudent person, in view of the fierce competition between the buying and selling parties, does not move forward.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Bull-Bear Wait and See</p>
<p>In the early trading of the standard yarn market, near-month contracts were still weak. Although the selling party had some pressure, the far-month contracts were priced higher, which was due to the fact that most people were pessimistic. However, the buying party's attitude was calm, and not only did they not close their positions, but they still bought low and increased their positions. The average speculator, in view of the bullish party's toughness, did not dare to act rashly. As a result, the situation on the floor was particularly clear, transactions were sparse, and the market was deserted. The results were that each month's price rose 0.1 to 0.2 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. Although business was sparse in the afternoon, the market situation was still firm. The results were that each month's price rose 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 yuan compared to the morning closing price. The sellers were Tongfu 250 bales, Junzhang 350 bales, Shengyuan 600 bales, Xincheng 250 bales, Yuda 300 bales, Daji 650 bales, Hengchang 450 bales, and Xincheng 250 bales. The buyers were Dafu 600 bales, Dachangcheng 200 bales, Xicheng 250 bales, Yida 200 bales, and Yichang 450 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day were as follows:</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Increase/Decrease Account Balance</p>
<p>May 173.25 172.9 173.2 Rise 0.20</p>
<p>June 175.4 174.9 175.3 0.40 34,950</p>
<p>July 176.4 175.9 176.4 0.40 44,700</p>
<p>August 171.3 176.8 171.2 0.50 45,900</p>
<p>September 177.6 177.3 177.6 0.30 23,750</p>
<p>October 177.8 177.5 177.8 0.40 15,250</p>
<p>800 Bales of Yarn Sold Weakly</p>
<p>The sales of spot yarn are still good. It is found that all gangs bought a total of 797 bales throughout the day. The market price is similar to the previous day. The purchase amount of each gang is as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 520 Shantou 65 Wuhu 10</p>
<p>Inland 50 Nanjing 3 Ningbo 4</p>
<p>Fellow Traders 10 Haizhou 10 Xiamen 5</p>
<p>Sichuan 60 Changsha 50</p>
<h3>Spirited Shift in Flower Trading</h3>
<p>The cotton market is slightly firm, with signs of rising prices. Although silver prices have increased, the standard gold price hasn't fallen drastically. It's said that the cotton delivered by banks this month failed inspection, causing sentiment to tighten. In addition, bullish investors have absorbed a significant amount, so although the situation is unfavorable, a new wave of selling hasn't started in the market, and prices remain stable.</p>
<p>Cheng Standard Stays Steady</p>
<p>Before the opening bell in the flower market, most discussions predicted a price decline due to U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's speech stating that the silver policy would remain unchanged. However, a telegram arrived stating that silver prices had soared by over 180 pounds. Contrary to expectations, the opening didn't see a sharp drop. Major bullish investors held firm, tightening the market. Scattered short-sellers covered their positions, resulting in all months rising by five points compared to the previous day's closing price. The market improved suddenly after the afternoon opening due to a shortage of chips and bullish news about U.S. cotton. The cotton delivered by short-sellers this month failed inspection, boosting sentiment. All months rose by five points to one dime compared to the morning closing price. It's noted that Yichang sold 2,900 piculs, Run Kang 1,700 piculs, Xincheng 900 piculs, Yuanxingchang 2,700 piculs, Chongan 1,200 piculs, Changji 900 piculs, Gengfeng 700 piculs, and Shenchang 700 piculs. Jifeng bought 2,300 piculs, Dafu 1,200 piculs, Tongxing 900 piculs, Yongda 1,400 piculs, Changhe 2,300 piculs, Xiacheng 1,300 piculs, and Tongfu 700 piculs. The daily high, low, and closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Standard Flower Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Change Account Balance</p>
<p>May Futures 23.60 33.50 33.60 Up 0.5 103,400</p>
<p>June Futures 34.10 33.95 34.10 0.15 184,800</p>

<p>October Futures 33.90 33.75 33.90 0.15 81,000</p>

<h3>Large Volume of U.S. Cotton Exported</h3>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton opened mixed, with various months fluctuating by one to two pounds. Due to delivery, the May futures contract had 3,000 notices. Many short positions were closed, and distant October and March futures saw government purchases to offset cotton sold abroad. Buyers of stored cotton sold the July futures. Japanese merchants were the main buyers of domestic cotton, primarily for export. In the afternoon, traders and New Orleans buyers entered, causing prices to rebound, closing firm. Spot prices rose by five points, May futures fell by two points, and other months rose by one to twelve points. British spot cotton was unchanged, futures rose by 23 points. Indian cotton initially weakened due to short-selling by speculators but rebounded due to public buying. Pipl rose by 0.25 to 0.5 rupees, Oomra fell by 0.25 rupees, and Broach rose by 0.25 to 0.75 rupees. (Reuter's dispatch from yesterday the 14th)</p>
<p>Pipl 145.15 up 0.25 18.00</p>
<p>July Futures 144.75 0.25 17.90</p>

<p>According to a Bombay dispatch, the opening forecast for Broach cotton for July/August futures on the 15th is 241 rupees, up half a rupee from yesterday's closing price.</p>
<h3>Grain: Forward Flour Market More Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, various months initially showed flat followed by rising prices, then a trend of stability in the near term and decline in the far term. The quoted price for foreign wheat saw a drop of about 1-2 dimes in Chicago and 2 dimes in Canada. When prices opened, the market sentiment was quite stable despite the slight decline in foreign wheat. Due to the current tightness of spot flour, North Road merchants continued to make purchases, pushing prices up to 5 dimes 2.75 cents. Forward months rose by 1-2 cents due to purchases from domestic merchants. In the afternoon, spot months remained firm due to the unwavering sentiment of merchants, while forward months saw active selling from manufacturers due to continued orders of two ships of Australian wheat at similar prices to before. Speculative short positions were also covered, causing the market to soften again. As a result, spot months improved by 1 cent 7.5 cents, June months by 1 cent, July/August months by half a cent, and September/October months by 0.25 cents.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Sentiment Softens</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning, various months initially showed rising and then falling prices. When prices opened, foreign wheat was quoted down by 1-2 dimes, but due to the rebound in the flour market the previous day and the activity of major bullish investors, the July futures contract opened up by 3-4 cents, and August/September futures also rose by 2-3 cents each. Later, prices weakened as the weather was good and more foreign wheat could be ordered. In the afternoon, all months showed a softening trend due to the decline in the flour market and the active selling of foreign wheat, resulting in a short-term rally and long-term weakness. As a result, the spot months fell by 1 cent, August months by 2 cents, and September months by 1 cent. The spot wheat market was generally stable because the arrival of goods could continue, and the factory appetite was not lacking, so customer sentiment was firm, awaiting a set outcome. Shandong wheat opened at 4.10 yuan, Henan wheat at 4.05 yuan, with 2,500 bags going to Fuxin and 400 bags going to Fufeng.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat 13th Closing 14th Closing Change</p>
<p>July 92.50 92.00 Down 0.5</p>
<p>September 93.375 193.00 Down 0.375</p>
<p>Spot 102.00 No market</p>
<p>Canada Wheat</p>
<p>July No market 87.75</p>
<h3>Small-Kernel Rice Recovers 3-5 Cents, Dumi Rice Falls 1-2 Dimes</h3>
<p>Foreign rice remained stable yesterday. Because inland demand continued to be strong and there were inquiries in the local market, owners and hoarders were no longer willing to sell at low prices, and the market gradually stabilized. If inland demand is strong again in the coming days, the market may need to rise further. Small-kernel rice was being actively purchased by local customers yesterday. In addition to 2,500 bags of spot goods being offered, 300 tons of Yinghua Company goods were also traded, with prices recovering 3-5 cents compared to the previous market. Other types of rice remained stable. Over 500 bags of Ke Xian rice were also offered, and the market was also holding firm.</p>
<p>The supply of Dumi rice (from South Shanghai) yesterday was not large, with only about 20 shipments arriving (a total of over 4,000 piculs). However, the local market was unusually slow, with very few customers inquiring. The situation was unusually quiet, and the market softened. South Port early rice fell by 1-2 dimes. High-quality Su Tong glutinous rice saw set prices, while medium-quality rice also saw small transactions. Although Yantai and Qingdao merchants purchased 600-700 bags of various late rice, prices also fell by 1-2 dimes. Yin Bian Yuan also fell by 1-2 dimes. (North Shanghai) Yesterday, 35-36 boats arrived from various routes downstream. Sales in the market were slow, but high-quality Bo rice was selling well due to limited supply. Market prices for white glutinous rice rose slightly from one cent to one dime, while high-quality Bo rice rose by 1-2 dimes. Medium-quality and early rice remained stable. White Yuan also rose slightly by about one dime. Other goods were weak.</p>
<h3>New Wenzhou Broad Beans Arrive in Volume, Sales Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the third batch of new Wenzhou broad beans arrived on the Dahua and Xin'an ships, totaling over 500 bags. Most of the goods were of medium quality, with only 187 bags of high-quality goods, which were purchased by Tianjin merchants at prices of 3.85 yuan and 3.75 yuan, with prices increasing according to quality. However, the market was weak. The only outlet is currently Tianjin, making it difficult to develop further. Only oil merchants were inquiring about soybean sales, with a total of 8-9 cars of various beans being traded. (Please refer to the market price column for market prices.) The market situation is temporarily unchanged, prices are stable, with little fluctuation.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Gold Prices Weak, Sugar Market Follows</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market was weak due to the decline in the standard gold price, causing the public association's trading to be sluggish. 24 raw sugar was offered at 16.40 yuan, but no transactions were made. Re-exported spot goods were offered at about 5.35 yuan, but no transactions were made. Road goods traded slightly at 5.30 yuan. There is nothing else to report.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Keemun Black Tea Suddenly Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Keemun black tea market became more active. This was due to the sinking of a tea boat in Poyang Lake, Jiangxi Province, which carried 2,400 boxes of black tea, all high-quality goods from the Qi Dounan Road district. After receiving this news, local Chinese and foreign tea merchants had a special perception. British merchants such as Jardine Matheson, Jinlong, Baochang, and Tianyu showed strong interest in high-quality Keemun tea, pushing prices up by 5-6 yuan. However, medium and low-quality goods still failed to improve. There was little progress in the green tea market. European merchants gradually tightened their bidding on Road tea, Earth tea, and Zhenmei due to the rising exchange rate. Many tea factories in the city have suspended operations or closed down.</p>
<h3>Metals: Zinc Sheet Market Quiet</h3>
<p>Metal trading has been very slow recently. Blue merchants and factories are both suffering from tight credit, and their appetite is surprisingly low. Only a few varieties of metal products are being offered, and there are very few large transactions. In this unfavorable environment, many goods are weakening. For example, East White Iron has fallen by 4-5 cents, with 6-foot iron estimated at 7.4 dimes and 7-foot iron sold at 9.12 dimes. Trading remains sluggish. The zinc sheet market is also mostly declining, but some have recovered slightly, so we record the details below:</p>
<p>(No. 2) Tea merchants and ordnance factories have slight movement. Toy factories and cigarette factories have not used up the goods they purchased earlier, so they are not buying. The estimated price is 23.50 yuan per picul, a significant drop of 5 dimes compared to before. It is reported that only a dozen barrels were traded yesterday.</p>
<p>(No. 3) Local merchants have made some minor purchases, but factories seem to have no transactions. The market is very quiet. The estimated price is 23 yuan. It is reported that not much was offered.</p>
<p>(No. 4) Recent inventory is thin, and demand from various routes is good. Prices are rising, selling at 23 yuan per piece, an increase of 2.5 dimes compared to before. (It is reported that over 20 barrels were traded, purchased by merchants from the Yangtze River area and local factories.)</p>
<p>(No. 5) Sales to battery factories have been quite good recently, so 30-40 barrels have been offered. Due to full inventory, prices have dropped slightly by 5 dimes. The estimated price is 21.50 yuan. The metal store on North Suzhou Road is reportedly offering the most.</p>
<p>(No. 6) The best outlet is also battery factories. In addition, few local merchants are interested. The current estimated price is 21.50 yuan, and trading is still acceptable.</p>
<p>(No. 7 &amp; 8) Hankou merchants have recently inquired but have made few purchases, resulting in a sluggish market and weak prices. The quoted price is between 20.50 yuan and 21 yuan. It is found that only 7-8 barrels were sold in two or three days.</p>
<p>(No. 9 &amp; 10) Printing bureaus and printing factories have made some purchases, but the market is very soft, so the quoted price is unusually weak, selling at 20 yuan. If cash is paid and large quantities are ordered, the price can be reduced by 5 dimes to 1 yuan.</p>

<p>Special Telecommunications Edition</p>
<h3>The Future of Sichuan-Guizhou Telecommunications Administration</h3>
<p>— Zuo</p>
<p>Since the communist bandits fled westward to Sichuan and Guizhou, and the central army rushed to pursue and suppress them, and after Chairman Chiang Kai-shek personally led the campaign, Chongqing and Guiyang have become the military and political centers of Southwest China. As a result, the telegraph offices in Chongqing and Guiyang, as well as military officer telegrams, are extremely congested, and telegraph services are extremely busy. Recognizing the crucial relationship between telecommunications and the military's bandit suppression efforts, the transportation authorities have repeatedly issued clear orders, strictly instructing the staff of each bureau to work diligently to facilitate military operations. However, the telegraph lines in the two provinces have been in disrepair for years, and the machinery is old and dilapidated. As a result, the communication efficiency is relatively low, and telegrams are often delayed. Outsiders who are unaware of the situation may blame the transportation authorities for neglecting their responsibilities and failing to plan ahead. However, the transportation authorities have been working on reorganizing and reforming the telecommunications administration for years, with a comprehensive plan and a consistent policy, proceeding step by step without any slackening. The successive establishment of remote local radio stations and the gradual repair of the Gansu-Xinjiang-Qinghai telegraph trunk lines in the past two years can serve as clear evidence of this. However, the completion of this plan and policy requires sincere cooperation between the central and local governments to be successful. Although the two provinces of Sichuan and Guizhou have been under the central government for many years, due to historical and geographical factors, all measures have failed to break free from old habits. Most of the directors of the telegraph offices in the two provinces are arbitrarily appointed by the stationed troops, and the telecommunications administration in the two provinces has therefore become lax. The provinces in eastern Sichuan still know how to follow the orders of the ministry, but the bureaus in western Sichuan and Guizhou govern themselves, and reports are often not submitted for years, so the Ministry of Communications is completely unaware of their economic situation and line conditions. Last year, Minister Zhu Jiahua, recognizing that the telecommunications administration in each province had been gradually reorganized, and that Sichuan and Guizhou could not be unique, ordered his subordinates to formulate a plan to repair the lines in the two provinces, hoping to facilitate communication in the border provinces. However, due to various reasons, despite repeated urging and the provision of funds and materials, it was never realized.</p>
<p>Now that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is stationed there, the local authorities, under the guidance and enlightenment of this sole leader, have clearly understood the central government's policy direction, and the implementation of the telecommunications reorganization plan in the two provinces is also easily resolved. Since January, the transportation authorities have set deadlines for the purchase and transportation of machinery and materials, the dispatch of cadres, the recruitment of workers, and the surveying of lines, completing everything on schedule. Everything is done with a spirit of speed, efficiency, and hardship, so the construction work is progressing very quickly. However, transportation in the two provinces is blocked and difficult, and the mountain roads are dangerous and steep, making the construction work different from usual. Although it is said to be fast, it still requires time. Recognizing this, the Ministry of Communications has specially prepared wireless machinery, components, and materials, and flown them to Guiyang to add radio stations. It is estimated that the station will be completed by the time this draft is published. With such comprehensive planning and efforts, it is expected that telecommunications in the Southwest will be smooth from now on. Writing to this point, a feeling of joy arises spontaneously!</p>
<p>We also have a strong feeling: the completion of transportation construction must be based on unified authority and local cooperation. Even in the reorganization of the telecommunications industry, it will not be successful without the above two conditions. This is because telecommunications is the nervous system of a country. If authority is not unified and local areas do not cooperate, it will inevitably affect the implementation of the entire plan, and even completely destroy the original construction that is already in place. The situation of the Sichuan-Guizhou telecommunications administration further confirms this. From this, it can be seen that the central government's power must be consolidated, and then authority can be unified. Local officials must be knowledgeable and reasonable, and then the new policies can be easily promoted. Otherwise, it will not be easy to do. Furthermore, although our country's telecommunications administration is said to be state-owned, the state does not provide subsidies, relying solely on telegram fee income to support itself. In recent years, all industries have been in decline, and the national economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. Telecommunications has also declined sharply. The construction of lines and the purchase of materials and machinery are mostly maintained by borrowing money. Even the large amount of materials needed for this reorganization of the Sichuan-Guizhou telecommunications administration is borrowed. These loans have contracts and must be repaid on schedule. However, with the current state of telecommunications revenue, there is no surplus to repay the debt. On the other hand, the outstanding fees for military officer telegrams are still increasing. If this continues, the telecommunications industry will inevitably collapse completely. At last year's telecommunications conference, Director Wang said, "Military and government agencies damage telecommunications, which is equivalent to damaging themselves." These words are worth pondering! The fees for military officer telegrams are like a drop in the ocean compared to the total military and government expenditure, and the amount is extremely small. It is hoped that military and government agencies will understand the difficulties of the telecommunications administration and stop delaying payment of telegram fees, so that the future Sichuan-Guizhou telecommunications administration can be said to be constructed. I pray that our wise military and government leaders pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>Military Radio Stations Cannot Receive and Transmit Public Communications</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Shortwave radio stations are simple to set up, easy to move, and highly effective, making them suitable for military use. Since the rise of the Northern Expeditionary Army, shortwave radio has been used, and military radio stations have been established in the name of the army to transmit military news, which has helped to stabilize the country and suppress the communist bandits. The effectiveness of this cannot be denied. However, the establishment of military radio stations is to supplement the deficiencies of the telegraph offices run by the Ministry of Communications in transmitting military news. The former is for temporary use for military purposes only, while the latter is for permanent public use. The two have different missions and different systems, and they should not be confused. Therefore, when the military has pacified the area, or when the capacity of the Ministry of Communications' radio stations is sufficient to meet the needs, the mission of military radio stations seems to have been lessened, and it may be necessary to move them elsewhere in order to clear other military communications.</p>
<p>According to Article 2 of the Telecommunications Regulations promulgated by the National Government: "Telecommunications operated by the state shall be managed by the Ministry of Communications of the Executive Yuan of the National Government. However, this does not apply to those established by the Navy, Army, and Air Force for military purposes." This means that the establishment of naval, army, and air force radio stations is entirely for military use, and the messages they transmit must be military information. Since there are competent authorities, there will be no violations. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications believes that there is no need to interfere, and it is not within the scope of the Telecommunications Regulations. On the contrary, if naval, army, and air force radio stations transmit private messages or news telegrams, regardless of whether or not they charge fees or who sent them, this act is contrary to the nature of military radio stations, infringes on the business of the Ministry of Communications' telecommunications, and violates the provisions of the Telecommunications Regulations. The Ministry of Communications may, in accordance with the powers conferred upon it by law, ban it. This is what must be done from the perspective of the Ministry of Communications.</p>
<p>From the perspective of military agencies, private telegrams should also be banned. The presence of radio stations in military agencies is like the presence of ears and eyes in a person. Just as ears and eyes cannot be lent to others, military radio stations cannot transmit private telegrams. Moreover, military communications value secrecy and speed the most. If private telegrams are allowed, not only will the efficiency of the radio stations be reduced, but there will also be a risk of leaking military secrets. Therefore, military agencies should severely punish their subordinate radio stations if they transmit private telegrams in order to prevent abuse. If a report is received from the Ministry of Communications, the cause should also be investigated in order to clarify the truth. As for using military radio stations to solicit news telegrams, which have not been inspected, and then transmitting them, this is especially forbidden by military agencies. This should be noted by the military authorities.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the sender, the telegram should not be sent to or requested to be transmitted by a military radio station. The reason is also very clear: Military radio stations are for military use and cannot operate commercially, as mentioned above. If members of the public entrust military radio stations to send telegrams in order to save on telegram fees, the telegram fees saved are minimal, but the act of disrupting the telecommunications system is very serious. Once the military agency finds that a certain station is sending private telegrams, and that a certain telegram was sent by a certain person, they will investigate and punish them according to law. Radio station personnel will be held accountable for illegally receiving telegrams, and the person who asked for the favor will be suspected of colluding and cheating, and will inevitably be punished with the crime they deserve. The telegraph offices run by the current Ministry of Communications are fast, reliable, and charge very low fees. Entering the door of the telegraph office is like a customer visiting a store, and everyone is welcome. If there is any delay in the telegram, you can also formally inquire. Why entrust the telegram to a military radio station for transmission and harm yourself and others?</p>
<p>Recently, the Ministry of Communications has received reports from various sources that a certain radio station (its name is being withheld) is transmitting private messages and news telegrams, and the investigation has confirmed this. The Ministry of Communications has the right to ban this radio station according to law, and to request the competent authority to impose the most severe legal sanctions on it. The author hopes that the radio station will immediately stop transmitting the above-mentioned commercial telegrams, and not bring trouble on itself.</p>
<h3>On Modernizing Telegraphs and the Public</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>In the beginning, the primary motive for establishing telegraph services in various countries was to circulate political and military information. Transmitting private and commercial telegrams was merely a sideline. Therefore, it is easy to imagine that the telegraph offices of the time had a very official air. Later, with the evolution of the times, the development of industry and commerce, and the improvement of public intelligence, telegraphs gradually shifted away from being primarily for official use and entered a period of being primarily for civilian use. Therefore, the term "commercialization of telegraphs" was already quite popular in enlightened European and American countries 20-30 years ago and was recognized as a matter of course. However, in our country, the implementation of this policy has only occurred in the last two or three years, and most of the public has not yet understood the significance of this matter, nor do they know how to utilize it. As a result, the process of modernizing telegraphs in our country has been relatively slow, which is a bit of a pity.</p>
<p>What is meant by "modernizing telegraphs"? It means that telegraph offices adopt the policy of striving to provide conveniences and reduce costs for the public in order to increase their business and develop their enterprises. To cite a few examples, telegraph offices in countries such as England, Germany, and the United States began promoting the "telephone reception and transmission of telegrams" method 20 years ago. This means that if one wants to send a telegram, they can notify the local telegraph office over the telephone to copy it down and immediately dispatch it. If a telegram is sent to a certain location, the local telegraph office can immediately notify the recipient over the telephone after receiving it. In this way, the speed of telegrams is increased three or four times, because the time required for a telegram to be transmitted from Telegraph Office A to Telegraph Office B is usually less than 10 minutes, but the time required for the sender to deliver the telegram to Telegraph Office A and for Telegraph Office B to send a messenger to deliver the telegram to the recipient averages 30 minutes each, for a total of 70 minutes. Now, if the telephone reception and transmission of telegrams is used, these two procedures each take an average of 5 minutes, for a total of 20 minutes, which is more than three times faster. After this, the effectiveness of telegraphic typewriters gradually became apparent, so countries such as England and the United States promoted the "private line reception and transmission of telegrams" method, which means that the sender, the recipient, and both telegraph offices each connect to a private line to receive and transmit telegrams using a telegraphic typewriter. This is naturally another step forward compared to using the telephone reception and transmission of telegrams. After the European War, due to economic factors, various cheap telegrams became popular in various countries, such as night letter telegrams, day letter telegrams, weekend telegrams, and New Year's and Christmas greetings telegrams. Recently, the United States has also seen the temporary popularity of social telegrams and gift telegrams. All of these are attempts to cater to the needs of the public and facilitate public communications. This is the true essence of modernizing telegraphs.</p>
<p>Looking back at our country, telegraph offices did not know what "commercialization" was four or five years ago, but in the last two or three years, the atmosphere has changed drastically. Regarding the "modernizing telegraphs" matter, they have caught up head-on and strived to be at the forefront. Taking the aforementioned various methods to facilitate the public as an example, they have all been equipped in a very short period of time. First, the "City Telephone Reception and Transmission of Telegrams Method" was promulgated and implemented by the Ministry of Communications on February 1, 1933. The regulations of this method are very thorough and convenient, and no less inferior to those of European and American countries. Second, the "Commercial Private Line Reception and Transmission of Telegrams Regulations" were promulgated on March 1, 1934, and are divided into telephone private lines and telegraph private lines. The telegraph private lines are further divided into telegraphic typewriter lines and Morse machine lines, and the regulations are also extremely complete. In addition, night letter telegrams, day letter telegrams, and New Year's greeting telegrams have all been gradually realized, and the "domestic social telegrams" established the year before last are especially similar to American social telegrams. At this point, we cannot help but feel a sense of reflection, that is, although it cannot be said that our country's current telegraph offices are standing ahead of the times in terms of striving to serve the public, they have at least caught up with the times. However, the fly in the ointment is that the public in our country does not have a clear understanding of this trend of modernizing telegraphs. May I ask how many of the readers of this article know about the "Telephone Reception and Transmission of Telegrams Method"? How many have used "social telegrams"? Thinking of this, I deeply feel that if our country wants to innovate and progress in various undertakings, it must put in twice the effort compared to other countries, which is not an exaggeration.</p>
<h3>Talking About Public Telephones</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>In our daily lives, telephones have become an indispensable tool. All public and private affairs that previously required face-to-face meetings can now be conducted through telephones. Although separated by vast distances, conversations are as if face-to-face. In recent years, with advancements in telephone technology, long-distance calls can utilize loading coils and amplifiers to reduce line attenuation, ensuring clear sound quality for both parties. Moreover, the invention of wireless telephones allows not only land-to-ship communication but also transoceanic conversations to become a reality from an ideal, showcasing their immense convenience.</p>
<p>However, while businesses and households readily install such scientific equipment due to business needs and convenience, the majority of the population, due to economic constraints, utilizes it sparingly. To address this deficiency, the Ministry of Communications established a public telephone system in September of last year, allowing businesses without telephones to enjoy the right to use them, aiming to popularize telephone services.</p>
<p>Currently, public telephones are available in Shanghai, Nanjing, Peiping, Wuhu, Zheng County, Shashi, Yangqu, Zhenjiang, Wuxian, Huaining, Qingdao, Hankou, Yantai, Jiujiang, and other places. Telephone bureaus, telegraph bureaus, telegraph offices, and postal branches in these locations have public telephones installed and open for business. To use these telephones, one simply registers the desired telephone number with the public telephone manager and pays a per-call fee. After the manager registers and issues a call ticket, they will dial the desired number. Once connected, the caller can directly communicate, making the procedure extremely convenient.</p>
<p>Furthermore, public telephones not only connect to local telephone users but also to long-distance telephone services. Therefore, users who have not paid a long-distance telephone deposit can apply at nearby telegraph offices or postal branches when they need to make a long-distance call, eliminating the need to travel to the central telephone office.</p>
<p>The call time for public telephones is set at five minutes or three minutes per call (depending on local conditions), but the timing is based on the period from the connection of the called number to the disconnection after the conversation. Therefore, each call can be conducted at a leisurely pace, and with each local call costing only three to five cents (depending on local conditions), even with slightly extended time or more frequent calls, the cost remains very limited.</p>
<p>Recently, the Ministry of Communications has added traffic information desks in telephone bureaus in Peiping, Tianjin, the capital (Nanjing), Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Wuxian, Qingdao, Yantai, Wuhan, and other locations. Inquiries about the following can be made through the telephone bureau information desk: (1) local telephone rental fees and long-distance call locations and prices; (2) domestic and international telegram sending locations and prices; (3) domestic and international mail delivery locations and postage rates; (4) daily business hours of post and telegraph offices; (5) standard time; (6) locations of local fire incidents; (7) train, ship, and long-distance bus schedules and prices; (8) daily programs and times of various entertainment venues; and (9) telephone numbers of local businesses. Users of public telephones can benefit from knowing all of the above information. Hopefully, the people of the country will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>How to Popularize Telecommunications</h3>
<p>— Baozhen</p>
<p>China's telecommunications industry cannot compete with European and American countries. However, major cities already have telegraph and telephone bureaus. In terms of telegraphs, there are landlines, submarine cables, and wireless telegraphs. In terms of telephones, there are local and long-distance telephones. The latest mechanical equipment has been adopted, and although not perfect, all kinds of communication tools are available. Apart from major cities, many smaller county towns, market towns, villages, and settlements do not have widespread telegraph bureaus. If we have urgent matters to telegraph to relatives and friends in these places, we can only send postal transfer telegrams or special delivery telegrams. The delivery of postal transfer telegrams and special delivery telegrams is naturally slower, making it difficult to promote universally and penetrate into the common people. According to surveys, only two or three out of a hundred telegrams are postal transfer telegrams or special delivery telegrams. It can be seen that the people using wireless telegraphs as communication tools are only a small number residing in major cities. Telegraph services can only develop abnormally in major cities and cannot be widely extended to county towns, market towns, and villages. Then, the realm of telegrams is too small, and the development of telegrams is also limited!</p>
<p>Given the current economic difficulties of the telecommunications administration and the large number of illiterate people in China, it is difficult to establish telegraph bureaus widely. Wireless telegraphs cannot be fully extended to towns and villages for the time being. Only long-distance telephones can meet the needs of the general illiterate public, because long-distance telephone equipment is simple, the expenditure is small, and it can be used without text, allowing users to speak directly. If it is an inquiry, the reply can be obtained at that time, which is more convenient than sending a telegram. Therefore, long-distance telephones are necessary to actively promote in places where there are no telegraph bureaus, especially between county towns, market towns, and villages, so that people living in the interior can also enjoy the convenience of communication. Currently, county governments in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, and other provinces have established local telephones or rural telephones, connecting to various villages and towns in the county. In order to facilitate public communication, the Ministry of Communications has established a method for county-run local telephones or rural telephones to connect and communicate with long-distance or local telephones of the Ministry of Communications, so that people in various places with county-run local telephones or rural telephones can communicate with relatives and friends in various places with long-distance or local telephones of the Ministry of Communications (for example, Shanghai can now connect with Tongli, Luxu, and other places). Isn't that convenient? After the implementation of this method, long-distance telephones can naturally be developed, and the effectiveness of communication will naturally penetrate into the people!</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government has established many long-distance telephones within the province. The Ministry of Communications has signed a method for collecting and delivering telegrams on behalf of Zhejiang, so that the people can enjoy the convenience of mutual connection and communication between the Ministry's telegrams and the province's long-distance telephones. Generally speaking, this is the manifestation of the central government and the local government dividing labor and cooperating, and the purpose is to facilitate public communication. We hope that the provincial governments, which have already built long-distance telephones, will quickly sign contracts with the Ministry of Communications in accordance with Zhejiang's method. Then, the county-run local telephones or rural telephones in those provinces will not only connect and communicate with the Ministry's long-distance telephones, but also collect and deliver telegrams on their behalf!</p>
<h3>Telecommunications Administration After Debt Consolidation</h3>
<h3>Recent Improvements in Telegraph Mechanical Equipment</h3>
<p>— Ye Zhonghua</p>
<p>3.  Installation of Audible Telegraphs: Except for important lines that have been equipped with automatic transmitting and receiving machines, most of our country's telegraph bureaus still use Morse machines. This has not been improved for decades. Not only is the annual consumption of paper tape a considerable expense, but the reliance on paper tape during work leads to negligence and errors. Recognizing this, the Ministry of Communications has converted the telegraph circuits with lighter workloads to audible telegraphs. The bureaus in Changle, Deping, Huoqiu, Zhengyangguan, Suqian, Shuyang, Shengxian, Yongjia, Ruian, and Gu'aotou have been completed and reported, and the results are said to be excellent.</p>
<p>4.  Improvement of the Connection Between Telegraph and Telephone Machines on Dual-Purpose Lines: To promote long-distance telephones, the Ministry of Communications has converted a large number of telegraph circuits with lighter workloads to also carry telephone services. However, when three or four bureaus are connected on one line, difficulties often arise due to simultaneous calls from telegraph and telephone machines. In addition, the telegraph relay must be adjusted from time to time due to the constant changes in the resistance of the return line, which often hinders communication. To improve this, the Ministry of Communications has recently installed specially made switches in the bureaus on each dual-purpose line, so that when telegraphing, the telephone circuit is cut off, and when telephoning, the telegraph circuit is cut off, so that the problem of simultaneous calls from telegraph and telephone machines will no longer occur. In addition, a battery adder-subtractor is connected to the large battery of the telegraph machine, so that the current can be increased or decreased at any time according to the size of the return line resistance, eliminating the trouble of adjusting the telegraph relay from time to time.</p>
<p>The progress of modern science is rapid, and the invention of telegraph machines is also changing with each passing day. The Ministry of Communications dare not be complacent about the above-mentioned improvements. I will only briefly mention one or two aspects based on what I know, in order to get a glimpse of the Ministry of Communications' efforts to improve telegraph mechanical facilities, which I believe the readers will be happy to hear.</p>
<h3>Television Business in London</h3>
<p>— Shilang</p>
<p>Based on the report of Lord Selsdon, chairman of the Television Committee, the British government will formally launch television broadcasting in London and throughout England in the near future. According to the committee, after eight months of careful deliberation with the majority of companies in the United States, Britain, and Germany, high-definition television has developed to the point where it can be initially opened for public service. Postmaster General Wood stated in the House of Commons that the government has approved the Television Committee's general recommendations and will take appropriate steps to achieve them. The main recommendation is that this business be managed by the British Broadcasting Corporation at the beginning of its venture, using both the Baird and Marconi systems alternately at the London transmitter. The initial test launch is likely to begin this year. Although the cost to television viewers will be high for some time, it will be reduced when the commercial scope is expanded.</p>
<p>The equipment and maintenance costs of the London television station are budgeted at 85,000 gold dollars by the end of 1936. The television films currently produced are about eight inches long and six inches wide, but they can be enlarged with an amplifier, although not very clearly. The radio waves used will be ultra-short waves, but according to the committee, the effective range of these radio waves is limited, and a large number of transmitters must be set up if national coverage is to be achieved. It is said that the Crystal Palace Tower, which is 200 feet above the Thames River, will be used as the site for the first television broadcast. Since June 1934, it has been used as a testing ground by Baird Television Limited. Both sound and picture have been well-performed at a distance of 25 miles from the Crystal Palace. The most recent test was to use two Baird-style home televisions (Teleyisors) to receive signals from the Crystal Palace, showing black and white bright films, one model worth 250 gold dollars, showing an eight-inch long and six-inch wide film, and one model worth 450 gold dollars, showing a twelve-inch long and nine-inch wide film. In addition, Baird's engineers demonstrated a kind of indirect emission film, that is, using sound film, transmitting sound and images, the time spent from making film to television is only thirty seconds.</p>
<p>Marconi intends to use extremely short waves (Micro.Wave) to establish the hope of television between Europe and the United States. He is currently experimenting with it near Genoa, Italy. Although this wireless radio inventor is busy in the London laboratory this winter, he still goes to Genoa several times to correct the work of his chief experimentalist M. Mattbieu, and will soon go again to make the final test. The problem that Marconi is currently trying to solve is to obtain a method of transmitting long-distance signals that are not interfered with and do not decay, in which case transatlantic television can be successful. Marconi's friends said that he believes that extremely short waves—a transmission medium about sixty centimeters long—can solve this problem. (Translated from the March issue of Radio-Craft)</p>
<h3>Short Biographies of World Telecommunications Inventors (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Jian</p>
<p>10. Professor Prosper Rene Blondlof</p>
<p>Professor Prosper Rene Blondlof was a French wireless radio expert. Born in 1849 in Nesle, France. He studied in Paris in his youth and served as a professor at the Nesle Scientific Society and an honorary professor and correspondent at the Institute of France. Blondlof was known for his research on electromagnetic waves, especially "the speed of electromagnetic waves" and "the laws of propagation of wireless waves in various media."</p>
<p>11. John Ambrose Fleming</p>
<p>Fleming was a British wireless radio expert. Born in Lancaster in 1849, he studied at the University of London, the Royal School of Mines, and St. John's College, Cambridge. From 1873 to 1874, he was an instructor at the Royal College of Chemistry. In 1877, he worked with Clerk Naxiwall on research at the Cavendisb Labaratory in Cambridge. He conducted many experiments on the British Association's resistance standard. In 1881, Fleming was hired as the principal professor of mathematics and physics at Nottingham University, but the following year he joined the Edison Electric Light Company. Later, the Edison Company merged with the Swan Company, and he was rehired as an electrical consultant for twenty years. In 1885, Fleming was appointed professor of electrical engineering at the newly established University of London. He was responsible for designing and arranging the latest electrical and engineering laboratory. In 1893, the university laboratory was completed. In 1892, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Fleming had been researching wireless telegraphy and telephony for many years. Since 1899, he had been the scientific advisor to the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company. His famous invention, the thermionic valve, was one of the most important steps in the development of wireless telephony. He wrote many papers and books on wireless telegraphy and telephony, and "The Principles of Electric Wave Telegraphy" is his standard work. His subsequent publications include "The Basic Principles of Wireless Telegraphy and Telephony," "The Mysteries of Wireless Telegraphy," "The Thermionic Valve and Its Evolution," "The Wireless Telegraphy Expert's Pocket Companion," and others. When he was a lecturer at the Royal Society of Arts, his lectures on electrical oscillations and radio waves, Hertzian radio wave telegraphy, and high-frequency measurement were praised by the world. He often lectured on "Wireless Radio" at the Royal Society. The Society awarded him the Hughes Gold Medal in admiration of his great achievements in electrical science and engineering. He also twice won the Society Premium of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, the highest honor for transportation papers. He also received the Albert Gold Medal of the Royal Society of Arts for his invention of the vacuum tube.</p>
<p>12. Dr. Aiver Heaviside</p>
<p>Heaviside was born in London in 1850. He worked as a telegraph operator for several years. After 1874, he lived in seclusion and devoted himself to the study of Maxwell's theory and applied it to telegraph and wireless telegraph. In 1891, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He was the recipient of the Faraday Medal of the Institution of Electrical Engineers and an honorary doctorate from the University of Göttingen. He advocated that the upper atmosphere is constantly ionized, causing electromagnetic waves to be reflected, so that wireless communication can be broadcast to the world. Therefore, Heaviside's name is immortalized with his theory.</p>

<h3>Telegraph Code Prophecy</h3>
<p>— Feiming (Unpaid)</p>
<p>"1935" is a "Worry" Year</p>
<p>Looking at the international news in various newspapers in recent months, they have been printing in lengthy detail the news of the great powers expanding their armaments, extending their military service, and concluding mutual assistance treaties. This situation fully shows that the Second World War has reached the stage of active preparation. People are worried and confused about this future war and do not know when they will know it. It has clearly predicted the trend of the world situation in the next four years. It said: "In (1935), the war will not break out, but people will 'worry' about it." In (1936), the great war finally broke out, and the towering crimes were exposed in this year. After this year, it is "(1937)", from then on, things will get better and better, the great war will end, just like recovering from a serious illness. Then it will be "(1938)", the fatigue of the war has disappeared, and people will be living "happily" again. This prophet tells us with certainty. If the reader does not believe it, please read what the four words of the newly compiled telegraph code (1935) (1936) (1937) (1938) are?</p>
<h3>Telecommunications World</h3>
<p>— Song</p>
<p>Opening of the London Telephone Sales Office</p>
<p>The Telephone Users' Inquiry Bureau of the Armour Hcuse in St. Martin.s-le-graand, London, has been opened by the Postmaster General. Information on how to install telephone sets that meet special needs can be obtained downstairs, and the first floor is a live demonstration. According to Sir Kingsley Wood, the opening of this so-called local telephone sales office is a new development, namely the automatic dial, so that users can select the numbers of other users by simply pressing the lever, and can get the users who are talking at that time.</p>
<p>Telephone Advertising in France</p>
<p>The Ministry of Post and Telecommunications has been working on the modernization of management. Three important daily newspapers (Paris Evening News, Paris Morning News, and Radical News) have created a method for advertisers to publish advertisements in newspapers by telephone. The advertising fee is collected at the end of the month with the telephone bill. However, it only applies to users listed in the telephone directory. When users want to place an advertisement, they should inform the telephone bureau of the content of the advertisement, as well as their name, address, telephone number, etc., by telephone. After the telephone bureau records and verifies it, it will notify the user of the advertising fee. All advertising fees will be collected from the user at the end of the month together with the current month's call fee. The Ministry of Post and Telecommunications has a special index to make it easy for its staff to handle this work. When taxpayers pay the telephone bill, they pay the advertising fee.</p>
<p>The telephone bureau benefits greatly from this method, because for each telephone advertisement, users make two more telephone calls, that is, the bureau collects two more call fees, and can charge the newspaper an agency fee of eighty centimes per advertisement. The promotion of this method, a telephone check similar to a postal check, is being reviewed. Telephone users can use telephone checks to place orders and make monthly payments. However, this plan will not be implemented recently.</p>

<h3>A Unique Will</h3>
<p>— Chui</p>
<p>In the old Qing Dynasty, if a VIP died, his descendants would fabricate a memorial tablet and present it to the emperor. The content of this memorial tablet was almost always about loyalty to the emperor and love for the country, just like the current ordinary obituary, which said that several VIPs and celebrities wrote four words such as "old age withered" or "another weak one" and so on, in the same way as decorations, this is why wills in our country are not worth much.</p>
<p>The other day, the Polish dictator General Piłsudski passed away. His will was unique. In his will, the general expressed that his brain should be dissected to show Piłsudski's respect for military science. I am not trying to increase the ambition of others and destroy my own prestige, specializing in worshiping foreigners, but in this place, foreigners' wills are indeed more practical and their thinking is more open.</p>
<p>People are originally two-dimensional, one is the body, and the other is the soul. If the soul leaves the body, this body is like rotten copper and rotten iron, what value is there? However, the concept of our countrymen is different, looking at the remains of the dead, as if they were treasures, not only are they unwilling to damage them, but they also have to contort them and decorate them very gorgeously, and bury them underground. Now, Piłsudski's will placed his heart at the feet of his mother, and his brain was donated to Polish university students for scientific exploration. His body was buried in the Wawel Cathedral in Krakow. His body was divided into three places. What a broad-minded thought.</p>
<p>However, he did not distribute his own body like this without any meaning. In fact, it has a very deep effect. The heart was transported to his birthplace, Vilnius, and placed at the feet of his mother, which means to drink water and think of the source and not forget his roots. The remains were buried in the Wawel Cathedral, which is the place where the former kings and national heroes of Poland were buried, indicating the greatness of his personality. His intentions are obvious. As for donating his brain for research by university students, what is the reason for this? The human brain has the same structure, and General Piłsudski's brain is not particularly well-born, and it is not particularly exquisite, just like Bi Gan in the Investiture of the Gods, others have seven orifices, and Bi is indeed eight orifices.</p>
<p>However, although General Piłsudski's brain is no different from ordinary people, it is still different from ordinary people. Otherwise, he was imprisoned many times, and his career failed many times, but his firm will was not only unwilling to change slightly, but also became stronger. Think about it, how can ordinary people achieve such mental ability? There is no doubt that his brain has research value.</p>
<p>Now let me give one small example. Piłsudski once fled to Japan. One day, he planned to eat Japanese food. He ate raw carp in a restaurant and ate the eyes of the carp. If it were someone else, he would definitely spit it out, but Piłsudski was always stubborn, and even used whiskey to guide it down. It can be seen that those who can endure what others cannot endure can surely do what others cannot do, and General Gong is a world hero.</p>
<h3>The End of the Road</h3>
<p>— Cheng Quan</p>
<p>The end of the road is a vast expanse of white, tinged with a sense of desolation: what lies ahead may be an iron-clad wall, or perhaps the bars of a prison? So I thought; I feared, trembled, and began to scrutinize this uneven, desolate end of the road, now reduced to a deathly silence.</p>
<p>Disappointment, anger, and daily hesitation – I have trod here step by laborious step, hobbling along. Passing through the dreams of childhood, the fervor of youth, I imprinted my footprints on the sands of time step by step (but then came a gust of wild wind, scattering all those cherished footprints of the past!). Like a diligent ox, fallen ill, I meandered along the boundless road.</p>
<p>Carrying the heavy baggage of life, how many seers were there at the time, advising me in sage tones! From books, from school lectures and blackboards, from the Arabic numerals in the many outlines written by the seers – they extended different hands, pointed in different directions, assumed different postures, uttered different sounds, and used diverse gazes of rebuke and command, saying, "Young man! Young man who is about to embark on a journey on the road of life! Hear my words, here is a great road, a true, flat, and endless road!"</p>
<p>The diverse directions confused the young man's path of travel, he stood and began to look around: there were a thousand voices guiding him, and a thousand roads bewildering him. Thus: using stubbornness, and using limited observation, he finally cast off a thousand conditional "good intentions" and outstretched hands (behind the hands, chains and weapons were hidden!) He resolutely chose a "great road" that, though not very flat, was remote and broad, extending as far as the eye could see, and slowly walked on.</p>
<p>Loneliness, hardship, distress! Ahead on the road, there were small stumbling stones and blinding sands: behind on the road, there were a thousand mocking, indifferent, derisive, resentful, and venomous eyes: "Ignorant calves who stubbornly rush around without belonging to anyone, the road has an end, the road is..."</p>
<p>And I, it has been many years now: rolling on the broad and arduous road of life I had chosen, being pricked, worn down, and suffering: and now, the sun ahead seemed to be gradually setting, and a chill pervaded my body. Moreover, ahead was a white expanse, like a wall, like a fence, the road seemed to foreshadow a suffocating end.</p>
<p>Thus, it was time to ponder: "At the end of the road of life, what exactly lies across it? Obstacles? Sea? Mist?" I guessed so, I doubted.</p>
<p>No one can answer this riddle, just as there are no substitutes on the road of life; the road of life must be walked by oneself, the baggage of life must be carried by oneself. I recalled: "No one is a prophet, the prospects gained from insufficient eyesight are as unreliable in their early sorrow as they are in their early joy; why measure it with terrifying conjectures (conjectures as terrifying as tiger-yellow dreams on a winter night) before truly reaching the last inch of the road?</p>
<p>It is better to use a more peaceful mind to deal with the countless stumbling stones on the current road of life that are difficult to deal with. What is on the other side of the unclear road is not worth thinking about: perhaps at the end of the road is a patch of azure water, three or two sprigs of green grass: perhaps it is truly a terrifying cliff and abyss. The small scenes of life are difficult to depict completely; one can only boldly walk to its front and recite with a courageous tone: "Perhaps at the end of the road is..."</p>
<h3>Red Rainy Day Without Rain</h3>
<p>— Jingfu</p>
<p>The hometown of exquisite marble has a scene as clear as a "moonlit night without a moon;" it also has a unique "red rainy day without rain" embracing the myriad splendors of Dali on Cang Mountain.</p>
<p>Facing Erhai Lake and leaning against Cang Mountain. Erhai Lake is like a flawless mirror; Cang Mountain? It is even more a place full of scenic spots. From beginning to end, it is a famous mountain composed of uniquely characteristic, wonderfully arranged eighteen streams and nineteen peaks. Standing on each peak, one sees a pair of streams on either side with melodious songs; but standing beside each stream, it transforms into a stream between two towering peaks that stir the soul. Each stream and each peak has its own completely different wonders, truly the spirit of mountains and waters!</p>
<p>When tourists have trudged from the top of Cang Mountain, playing past Yunlu Peak and Xieyi Stream, and along Canglang Peak, Wanhua Stream, Wutai Peak, and Yangxi, the rainy day without rain appears in a scene formed by the Mangyong Stream between Lotus Peak and Baiyun Peak, which are closely connected to Yangxi.</p>
<p>Mangyong Stream flows down between Lotus and Baiyun Peaks, named Mangyong. Its waves surge and rush, its momentum is magnificent, it is not difficult to imagine its posture!</p>
<p>The central parts of Lotus Peak and Baiyun Peak are full of steep rocks, cliffs that are difficult to approach, towering and frightening. The rushing Mangyong Stream surges down, and here it violently strikes the rock walls. Throughout the year, the rapid current strikes the walls, gurgling and roaring, forming a scene of splashing water flowers that is more wonderfully exquisite and rare than a large waterfall.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, here, the side rock wall of Baiyun Peak facing Mangyong Stream and the adjacent area are slightly lower; so the splashing water flowers all slant towards the side of Baiyun Peak. That area has the reputation of a rainy day without rain all year round.</p>
<p>And to view the scenery in the middle of the two peaks and Mangyong Stream, one must also approach this place of rainy days without rain to see more clearly: therefore, tourists often look at the awe-inspiring Mangyong Stream from afar and are fascinated by it, they cannot help but climb close to the place of rainy days without rain, placing themselves in this wonderful, otherworldly exquisiteness, observing and playing in the rain. A feeling of surprise and wonder, a serene beauty, naturally arises, and they are enraptured by it.</p>
<p>The mountains are lush and verdant, constantly playing the heart-stirring song of nature, gurgling like the sound of metal and stone. Showers of rain splash, and the rivers and mountains are like a living picture book that dances and sings, making people forget their physical form in the mundane world, greatly feeling the thoroughness of the spirit.</p>
<p>Why is the rain red? Look! Look closely at the white waves of the upper reaches of Mangyong Stream from afar, and after a while, they become red waves. At the same time, the name Hongyan. Because the rock walls there are steep and difficult to approach, one can only see from afar the torrent raging, red. Once, the stream washed something red. This red wood is harder than horn, so people guess that long-lived redwood grows between the rock walls, so the water becomes red waves when it washes over it.</p>
<p>And redwood is very precious. But the masters of our rivers and mountains did not manage it; but more than ten years ago, a foreign engineer went there specifically to test it, and even risked going down with a machine to explore it, but unfortunately, he was swallowed by the stream, and his body was washed down Cang Mountain.</p>
<p>Since then, no one has asked about it. Only all year round seeing the red torrent splashing, vividly like red rain, gathering on the side of Baiyun Peak, forming that never-ending, otherworldly exquisiteness of red rain without rain.</p>
<h3>Durian Girl</h3>
<p>— Jingyun</p>
<p>After dinner, treading on the full moon, I walked along the tranquil and beautiful Jiangwan Road, leisurely whistling a light, passionate tune with a southern flavor. The wind, mixed with the scent of flowers, gently blew in gusts, like the soft and delicate feelings of a young girl, caressing people's hearts and souls in a drunken state. The wind in May is so sweet and pleasant!</p>
<p>At the corner of Jiangwan Road and Dongtiyu Road stands a majestic and tall Western-style building. Around the 洋房 are layers of lush trees. The electric lights in the 洋房 flickered through the dark foliage, setting off the moonlight that melted into a sea of silver on the earth, making it even more beautiful and tranquil - this is the home of my childhood playmate, Huang Zeren.</p>
<p>Gently pressing the doorbell on the edge of the iron gate, the small window on the iron gate opened with a dull sound, and the gatekeeper's two mouse-like eyes poked out, scrutinizing me carefully like little mice. I quickly pulled out a business card from my pocket and handed it to him, saying:</p>
<p>"I'm looking for Mr. Huang Zeren."</p>
<p>After about three minutes, the iron gate finally opened. Quickly I saw Huang Zeren striding out from inside, running and jumping to the stone steps, stretching out his hand, greeting me from afar. He was still the same as he was years ago, unchanged, a short, stocky young man!</p>
<p>"Xiao Ling, you've come at just the right time, we're just peeling durians, durians, you know? The durians you miss the most! Haha!..." He tightly grasped my hand, seeming very pleased, his voice growing louder and louder, then laughing with a haha.</p>
<p>"When did you come back from the South Seas -- Nanyang --? Did you bring any good news?" We held hands tightly, very excited, talking as we walked into the guest room. Sure enough, Zeren's mother and younger siblings were happily peeling durians on a. The rich aroma filled the entire living room, such a sweet and fragrant southern fruit!</p>
<p>Eating durian made me think of the durian girl from the South Seas. She had two dark, sparkling eyes full of fiery passion, and when she spoke, she was so gentle and generous, without the wildness or aloofness of a barbarian girl. This young girl, although separated from me for many years, all the impressions she gave me were deeply imprinted on my mind, eternally remaining.</p>
<p>Whenever durians were in season, on a bright, clear moonlit night, I always liked to row a small boat with Zeren, along the poetic, tranquil Chao Phraya River, straight to the durian boats in the Wang Luang delta to buy durians. One night, we inadvertently discovered this beautiful, quiet durian girl on a durian boat.</p>
<p>The days passed like the flowing water of the Chao Phraya River, and the durian girl and we gradually developed a friendship from being customers. She often picked and kept the best durians for us; she sat on the gunwale without shyness and talked to us; sometimes she even sat in our small boat, drifting to the center of the winding river like a chain, admiring the crystal clear moon in the sky. Her silver bell-like voice told us many trivial things about her family, and the planting of all kinds of fruits, lingering until the late hours of the night, before she reluctantly returned.</p>
<p>The night before I was to leave the South Seas, the three of us rowed a light, nimble boat again, stopping on the river, letting it drift with the waves. The durian girl was thoughtfully silent, her head pressed against my chest, her two eyes full of fire and passion, staring blankly at the moon in the sky.</p>
<p>"Lina, I am going to part with you, tomorrow, tomorrow I am going back to Tangshan."</p>
<p>"Uh, Tangshan,...Tangshan is said to be very beautiful, Mom said!"</p>
<p>"Then do you want to go play too?"</p>
<p>She was silent for a while, finally shaking her head and saying, "Mom won't let me leave," her voice with a touch of sad bleakness, her eyes already wet.</p>
<p>When I see durian, it reminds me of the durian girl from the South Seas, her beautiful appearance, great strength, are deeply imprinted on my mind, eternally remaining.</p>
<h3>Tea Tasting</h3>
<p>— Jin Ren</p>
<p>Saying "eating tea" in a more refined way is "tasting tea," which makes people seem more sophisticated. After doing heavy work, gulping down a full cup from the spout of a teapot is eating tea. Wasting one's time in a teahouse every day is called tea tasting. Recently I have liked going to teahouses alone, which seems to belong to the second category, but whenever the red sun sets, dragging my faltering steps homeward, I regret each time that I am too depressed, passing the time in teahouses, we do not have this blessing; even if you are unemployed, you should use the time for tea tasting to think of a way to remedy it, the bitter taste of tea symbolizes your future!</p>
<p>But when my heart is gnawed at by pain, I appear in the teahouse again. I want to pass these unbearable days more quickly, and while taking this step, I also think about other ways to pass the time. I have no experience in eating tea. When I was a Boy Scout, what I still remember is the instructor's belief that "drinking plain water is hygienic." Although I later learned to drink coffee and cocoa, for one of China's three major products, with stores selling it opening branch stores in increasing numbers, and the sales of tea in its own market being astonishing, I never thought that it had the same effect as smoking opium.</p>
<p>When I was a child, I used to hold my grandfather's robe and go to the teahouse every day, and when the kerosene lamps lit up, I would hold my grandfather's robe and go home. However, eating tea (or tea tasting) did not interest me, what made me happy was the teahouse: because there were many countless uncles and grandfathers who messed up my brain. They were particularly preferential to a comrade's grandson, and when peddlers came upstairs to call out their wares, they always had to spend a little change to make a small sale for them. Later, my grandfather even allowed me to freely grab whatever I liked from the baskets of the various peddlers. There was an even bigger reason, which was that if there was any lively event in the town, such as a competition that children liked, or a community theater performance, if I didn't go to the teahouse like my sisters and wanted to see the excitement, there was no hope of permission. Only in the teahouse would your requests never be refused, so I especially liked A-Gen, the tea stove man with a big scar on his forehead, sometimes he simply hid it from my grandfather and took me to wander around.</p>
<p>Now my grandfather's grandson is a father of a son, and everything from my grandfather's era has died like my grandfather. After taking on the heavy responsibility of my grandfather, I actually started going to teahouses like my grandfather. Drinking bitter tea every day, I couldn't help but churn up dreams of the golden age.</p>
<p>But I still have no experience in eating tea. I occupy a corner alone, that position facing a clock tower outside the window. The tea server also greets first-time customers with a smiling face and asks the standard phrase "Have you eaten yet?" Every day I come, he greets me as if I were a friend. Sometimes he talks about news not recorded in the newspaper, and also takes out a cigarette to give me this last one. I thank him for quickly sending my time past. But that teahouse is too busy, we rarely have the opportunity to talk freely. As for those comrades who are tea tasting, I am shy about trying to curry favor with them, I have not even learned to "eat tea"! One day my shortcomings were discovered by the tea server, and I was even more afraid to steal a glance at them, perhaps those well-dressed figures would think of ideas contrary to their clothes. So I always stared at that clock tower, hoping it would jump over a few numbers at once. Only I know this painful situation, and do I still want to force myself to be elegant and call it tea tasting? That bitter taste of tea symbolizes your future!</p>

<h3>"The Merry Widow" Screening Tonight in Nanjing</h3>
<p>After the silver screen singing queen Jeanette MacDonald and Maurice Chevalier's "The Love Parade" made a splash, MGM made every effort last year to reunite the two in "The Merry Widow," still directed by the first-rate Ernst Lubitsch. Her beautiful face and pearl-like voice are probably still vivid in the minds of high society ladies and gentlemen. Now, "The Merry Widow," a collaboration between her and singing king Nelson Eddy, is being screened tonight in Nanjing.</p>
<p>"The Merry Widow," originally named Naughty Marietla, is the greatest creation of the great composer Victor Herbert's life. The story is about a French princess from the Louis XV era who escapes marriage and encounters pirates, eventually eloping with the warrior Warrington, a musical opera art treasure. MGM spent a lot of effort and money to buy its copyright. As for the film's director, Van Dyke, he is a rising genius, a world-class director of new creative styles. The picture shows a scene from the film.</p>

But in his busy schedule, he still finds time to play basketball and ping pong. When the mood strikes, he writes a few lines of new poetry, using his healthy and beautiful mind to cultivate his artistic hobbies. He is truly a promising young man.</p>

<h3>Diao Banhua Feels Sweet Even Playing a Ghost</h3>
<p>It is common for actors to pretend to be dead for the sake of acting. It is their duty, and there is no reward to speak of. However, Diao Banhua recently received a very satisfactory reward for pretending to be dead in "Autumn Fan Bright Lamp," because the place where she was laid out as a corpse was inexplicably covered in candied orange peels. Except for the fact that she had to lie still when the camera was rolling, she could eat as many candied orange peels as she wanted during the lighting, focusing, and rehearsals. With such a good reward, no wonder that after the director called "Cut!", she repeatedly said, "Dying under candied orange peels is sweet," and asked to shoot a few more takes in the same way.</p>
