<p>時評</p>
<h3>意阿戰爭的五十日</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>意阿戰爭。自爆發以來。到昨天已滿五十日了。意方最初的估計。以爲戰爭的推進。可以一鼓而下。結果完全證明了它的失算。這場戰爭將拖延到多少時日。發展到如何局面。現在還是很難斷言。我們姑就五十日來的戰况。分爲三個方面。作一簡括的結算。</p>
<p>第一。在軍事方面。意軍的空中轟炸與運用坦克車的戰略。雖然造成了多少的恐怖。但阿軍採取遊擊戰術。牽制了敵軍的進展。同時本身卻沒有蒙受重大的損失。在北部戰綫。意方以空軍作主力。轟炸得最爲猛烈。不過阿方死者都是些老弱婦孺。只顯示了意軍的慘無人道。實際上阿狄格拉。阿杜華以至麥卡爾的被佔領。阿軍差不多都是自動的退出。兵士的犧牲是很微的。南部戰綫因爲地勢比較平坦。意方以坦克任主力。但戰綫展延得很長。又因天雨多日。氣候潮濕。意軍染病的很多。直到現在。意軍還沒有佔領哈拉爾。達到截斷鐵道綫的目的。墨索里尼因爲作戰計劃的不順利。已把北部戰綫的主將臺波諾換去。主張改取急進的戰略。大槪在不久以後。意軍將和西育姆將軍所統率的阿軍。開始大規模的主力戰。在萬山之中。阿軍佔着天時和地利上的優勢。意軍雖有飛機大砲。要取勝是很不容易的。</p>
<p>第二。在外交方面。意方軍事上的不順利。已引起國際間對於它的更大壓力。從本月十八日起。國聯會員的五十餘國。開始了對於意國的經濟制裁。意政府雖表示强硬。而國內的財政經濟已有捉襟見肘之勢。對阿軍火封鎖。已經開放。阿國得到了這點方便。抵抗力量將更增强。現在英國一邊集中巨大艦隊。在東部地中海示威。一邊再拉攏法國。運用外交手段。希望把戰事早作結束。但英法能用怎樣的方法。使意阿雙方同意停戰。是很有疑問的。</p>
<p>第三。在阿國民族鬬爭的精神方面。五十日來的經騐。已經造成了一個光榮的紀錄。阿國對於意軍的侵略。是發動了全民族的力量。從事抵抗。壯男婦女以至囚徒。無不齊心協力。站在　爭的前綫。本月二十日阿政府致國聯的文書中說。我們可以驕傲地說。除了戈格薩一人以外。阿國酋長都沒有被敵方收買去」。這顯示了阿國內部的齊心一致。文書中又說。「阿國政府與民衆將作戰至死。不顧戰爭的代價與時間。以脫去野蠻者的支配。」這又是多麼堅决的表示。</p>
<p>從五十日來阿人抗敵的經驗中。可以知道他們必能繼績抵抗下去。保持最後的勝利。我們覺得。這短短五十日中所表現的。阿國民族解放鬭爭的精神。巳是非常可寶貴的了。</p>

<h3>東北治安狀況</h3>
<p>— 一臧</p>
<p>日本自民國二十一年以還。投資於滿洲者。巳達九億元。而滿洲生產。除礦業方面略有收益外。其他毫無進步可言。佔生產大部分之農業。則竟陷於深刻的恐慌狀態。農事之改良。及新種農產品之栽培。均正在試騐期內。欲收成效。尙須經相當年月。且四年來農民負担日重。據日人山崎靖純調查。就佳木斯一地而言。小麥一項。由松花江運至哈爾濱。僅距離三百二十公里。在四年前。須納苛捐九種。今雖减爲七種。但實際上負担。反比九種爲重。而農民年來又以貨幣所得激减。相對的負担大增。因而窮困益甚。對於現狀。莫不疾首痛心。惟在武力控制之下。無可如何耳。</p>
<p>本年偽組織當局對於生產方面。力謀增進。如東部之米。西部之羊。南部之棉。果樹。烟草。落花生。芝蔴。北部之小麥。亞蔴等皆聘請日人。計劃改良。然而滿洲農業之發展。事實上不能迅速收效。農產物除大宗出產大豆外。多因氣候關係。不易繁殖。農民試植新種。屢遭失敗。若增大生產。輒與日本資本主義之利益相衝突。加以全滿義軍起伏靡常。農產物受軍事影響。被害尤大。在如此情形之下。農民不得不鋌而走險。或投效義軍。或則轉爲赤黨。盤踞各處。如『間島二區。（在吉林省延吉縣附近。爲二三十方里山嶽地帶）。在依蘭溝北方。已有「蘇維埃」之建設。迄今歷時四年。日軍雖傾注全力。予以征剿。仍難敉平。本年八月。據關東軍發表滿洲「匪賊」人數如下。</p>
<p>『兵匪』　八、〇〇〇人</p>
<p>『共匪』　七、〇〇〇人</p>
<p>『××匪』　五〇〇人</p>
<p>『土匪』　一二·五〇〇人</p>
<p>計　二八·〇〇〇人</p>
<p>上述人數·若連與義軍互通聲氣之農民合計·實不下二十萬人。茲但就所謂『共匪』言之。所謂「共匪」。號稱「在滿抗日義勇聯合軍。」共分十二軍。其第六軍。散處北滿。他則分布於吉林安東綿亘至大連之三角地帶。據日方調查。各軍駐地如下。</p>
<p>第一軍…在北滿鄰接地帶的滿鐵沿綫。（統率者不明）</p>
<p>第二軍…在間島一帶與朝鮮共黨相聯絡。歸朱禎統率。</p>
<p>第三軍…在珠河盤石方面。歸趙尙志統率。</p>
<p>第四軍…在密山虎林方面。歸李延祿統率。</p>
<p>第五軍…在寧安穆稜東寧方面。由周保中統率</p>
<p>第六軍…在湯原梓川方面。（統率者不明）</p>
<p>此等共軍。大抵在密林中築有兵舍。利用山間曠地。開墾農業。頗有組織。其所採戰鬥法。爲純粹的遊擊戰法。神出鬼沒。雖精銳之日軍。亦往往入其彀中。數年來日軍在依蘭溝及百草溝一帶。討伐達百數十次。卒難奏功。如民國廿二年四月。日軍曾向間島「蘇維埃」大舉進伐。竟爲共軍所敗。犧牲達三分之二。蓋共軍在該區。設有兵營與兵工廠。製造槍械彈藥。依據天險。長期抵抗。依蘭北方合水坪地方。且樹立「蘇維埃區域」界脾。日人如欲經過其界。須受嚴密檢查。因此日軍自昭和七年起。直至今日。仍不能越雷池一步。聞依蘭溝警察隊出動討伐。達八十餘次。交戰百三十餘次。警察署員之被害者十四名。日軍長官死者四十四名。至共軍所以能持久之故。實因農民與共軍。成爲一體。經濟上農民之共同組織。能使金融不致呆滯。且農事改良的指導訓練。又極純熟。各處村落在戰事期間。互通消息。共同防衛。故日軍卒難進攻。</p>
<p>聞該區共軍之組織。與正式軍隊。完全相同。採三三制。有軍師旅團營運排之分。幹部均受相當敎育。在密林中所設之兵營內。且附設學校。採用「朝鮮國定敎科書。」舉凡日常必需之生活品。完備無缺。至於彼等之宣傳文字。係用日本語滿鮮語中國語三種。日本語多用於日本軍隊方面之宣傳。描寫日本東北地方窮乏狀態。勸令日兵入伍合作。在交界地方之岩壁樹木及路傍電柱等。張貼頗多。甚至日軍兵營壁上亦常發見此類傳單。最奇者。不論何處。均有彼輩密探。其情報網與連絡網之普遍。實出於意想之外。平時利用小販乞食。偵探外間消息。採辦糧食。故日軍尙未出發。而消息已傳至共軍本部。數年前共軍會在羣山崗巒。設置烽火。以爲傳達價號之用。今則各隊皆備電筒。利用夜襲。遂致日軍水難安枕。去歲關東軍與朝鮮總督府協議辦法。規定間島集團部落防禦法。即招收部落中曾遭「共匪」殺害者之家屬。組繳武裝自衛隊。同時配給耕地。使其自給自足。然而因防衛力單薄。反爲共軍所襲。加以部落民對於墾荒自給。各難維持。往往携械潛逃。轉而加入共軍隊伍。故間島共軍之勢力。益不可侮。</p>

<p>據中華工業聯合總會委員錢承緒稱、關於原料漲價、商品未能於水平綫上、同時漲價一節、本會曾經慮及、故於前屆會員大會中提出討論、茲値過渡時期、此種困難情形、在生產之立塲上言、究應定何種步驟、以平衡產　間之關係、又政府疊次通令各地商人、不得抬高物價、其所謂物價之範圍、是否限於一般商品、並此項法令、究能收如何效果、依最近一週間之情形、以資覜察似覺收效尙難預期、此僅關於原料與製成品兩項、物價不平衡之情形而論、至關於錢幣籌碼之旋轉與運用方面、以本人感覺所及、在昔日羣以籌碼不敷、農村製造兩受其困、今者局勢轉變、在經濟之原則上言、金融動向、似可漸趨活躍、各部份事業、因此亦可日增繁榮發達、但於事業上、一方面言加增籌碼、集中現金、同時別無其他方法、以支配其數量、使一般社會農村製造諸項、均得到平均支配之實際、則　商品漲價、製造加增、市塲購買力仍依舊　縮、其　　即苦　有價無市、揆諸政府統制金融之旨趣以會展國內市塲對外貿易種種問題、一時仍難收　之效果、爲此本會主張於今日金融駔織情　之下、政府旣以集中、金、改革幣制爲民族經濟上求相當出路、一方面似仍應於一貫政策之下、同時促進工商業之聯絡與結合、在政府指導之下、組織健全之金融市塲、提供巨量數額、以押進工廠股票、有利證券及地產、以便所有生產上不能流動之票據、悉皆變爲可以流動之資金、以爲有效、如此辦法果能實現、不惟一轉瞬間呆擱之物、可以變爲流動商品、以代現金、則碼之增加、可收實效、而國家生產數量、亦自能因之增加云云</p>
<p>胡西園談</p>
<p>據市商會委員胡西園談、自法幣施行以來、籌碼活躍、農村有救濟之希望、內地購買力、可逐漸增高、各項物價、在水準綫上、視其本身之需要、當得合理的上漲、工商業於是漸入繁榮之境、此固吾人所極端期望者、惟近察各業狀况、在此施行法幣之過渡時期、反現苦樂不勻之象、推厥原因、實爲原料漲價太驟之故、例如紗布之漲價、其比例不及棉花之昂貴、絲價暴漲、而絲織品之售價、未能充分抬高、但此或尙可諉爲國際貿易關係、環境所趨、無法遏止、至若輕工業需要之大部份雜料、據調查所得、其大多數尙不受到若何彩響、不過原料商受到幣制改革心理上之感覺、驟然漲價者、實繁有徒、他如存料不豐之中小工廠、一方面因購買力尙未激增、售價不能提高、一方面購進高價原料、成本頓見增高、在此種矛盾性之環境下、誠感深切之痛苦、其結果製造廠之出品、固徘徊歧途、而原料商之交易、亦令人躊躇　望、於是造成各方面貨物銷路呆滯、此種作繭目縛、自貽伊戚之營業方針、吾人當先促原料商之覺悟、以求相互之利益、本人以爲工商團髒、應　法勸吿各地原料商、對於各種原料之漲價、勿求太聚、致减少其自身營業、而增加製造廠之成本云云、</p>

<h3>公勤鐵廠參觀紀</h3>
<p>— 金華亭</p>
<p>圓釘與鐵刺網在工業·軍事上之需要</p>
<p>（一）鋼鐵業與國家強弱</p>
<p>鋼鐵業在近代化國家必要條件下。實占極重要之地位。大而至於軍事交通。小而至於營造建築。無一不以鋼鐵為主要材料。故一國之強弱與鋼鐵業之盛衰。實有莫大之關係。我國對於鋼鐵業。向不講求。故凡國家一切建設上之鋼鐵原料。無不仰給於人。甚且一釘之小。亦鈞求諸洋貨。雖近年以來國人漸漸注意。對軍事·工業·上所需之鋼鐵用品。凡能自製者。莫不竭力設法研究自造。惟原料一項。仍須仰給於人。實非根本辦法。希望政府與國民注意及這為辛。上海公勤鐵廠·對於鐵業之努力。已有十餘年。雖限於資本與原料。未能有偉大之貢獻。而於軍事上之鐵刺網。工業上之圓釘。已有相當之成績。且該廠所用之機器。均能從二十座之母機中製造。亦屬難能可貴也。</p>
<p>（二）圓釘與鐵網之來歷</p>
<p>我國製　事業。尚係業鐵匠者之副產品。其製造方法係用手力　成形狀粗糙。色澤黯黑極易生銹。實不合現代之需要。嗣以機製之洋釘輸人。手鎚鐵釘。無形打倒。同時亦多一漏　　。按　製圓釘。為法國所發明。其輸入我國。亦以法國為最早。旋歐美各國。競相仿製。一七八〇年。德法兩國。始以少數圓釘。輸入美國。因適合美國人民之需要。當時業此者。　　　　時。　一九一七年。美國已能年製同樣之圓釘一千七百萬桶。一九二七年增至二千九百九十四桶。日本全國共有大小釘廠三十餘家。其中　大兩家。　設於國營鋼廠之內日出圓釘千餘桶。每年產釘總額。約在三百萬桶左右。除少數銷售南洋　島及我國東北等地外。餘均自給。我國銷耗圓釘。據最近之總計。每年約需五六十萬桶。（每桶一百磅）此後實行各種建設。則圓釘之需要數量。當有極大之增加。向者仰給舶來。今則已有國貨可資替代矣。鐵絲網為何國　發明。尚無查考。惟據公　伯廠總經理黃君介　稱。此項鐵絲網以美國　用為最早。數量亦最多。鐵絲網分兩種。一則為有刺鐵絲網。係軍事　　工事用品。一則為無刺鐵絲網　。係住宅花園。或鐵路車站建築護網所用。</p>
<p>（三）公勤鐵廠創辦經過</p>
<p>公勤鐵廠。係鐵業界黃伯耕·顧馨一·丁仁　等所創辦。於民國十一年成立。實收資本國幣十萬元。製造範圍。初本側重於翻砂機器。意在製造各式應用機件。以代舶來。故一切應有母機。如車·刨·鉗·模·之屬。設備齊全。嗣以成本過鉅。外貨膨脹。營業難圖發展。遂擬變更計畫。適有前同濟大學校長德人倍倫子博士。往該廠參觀。指陳鐵絲釘一項。需用頗廣。國內並無此項製品。並出其所擬製釘工廠計畫全書。力勸該廠增設製釘專部。以裕收入而培廠本。同時前漢陽鋼鐵廠長吳任之博士。於參觀該廠後。對於添設製釘專部。力贊其成。經該廠董事部一再考慮。毅然採納。遂於民國十二年成立製釘部。初辦之際。僅置德機四架。先行試驗。以缺乏經驗之故。結果未能盡如預料。旋經經理黃君介輔。潛心研究。始構窺其堂奧。技能漸由拙劣而粗佳。成績日臻於完善。惟於原料一端。頗感困難。購新貨旣嫌成本過重。用舊料又復時虞竭蹶。乃設拉絲部。自行拉絲。以資挹注。方期絲釘原料。從此得以自供自足。詎知江浙風雲。適逢其會。時而擾攘。波及金融。該廠遂至忍痛停工。迨戰事平息。又復困於經濟。不得已將製釘部出租。與洋商合作。該廠同仁等。依人作嫁。益自惕勵。舉凡製釘工作之改進。國外釘業之調查。悉心探討。致力靡遺。同時又復切切以恢復母廠為念。迨國府成立。首重振興實業。該廠同仁。認為時機已至。乃將先後所經之困苦艱難情況。瀝陳工商財政兩部。擬具提高洋釘進口稅率意見書。貢獻當局。同時聯合各實業團體晉京請願。凡此種種。無非為求脫離洋商之　絆。恢復固有基礎之對策。其時合作之洋商。適另有組織。彼此解約。廠基始得恢復。該廠董事黃耕伯親赴首都。向主管各部。面陳實情。一面囑令召開債董會議。試行復工。此乃民國十九年事也。斯時僅有釘機八架。日製圓釘一二十桶而已。二十年元旦。政府公頒布新稅則。對於該廠所陳稅率意見書。頗能盡量採納。同時復得熱心實業之蔡仁初君。誠心合作。流動資本。賴以裕如。對於內部之組織。亦克循序日進於完善。同年十月。蔡得政府獎勵。以首先製造圓釘（特種工業品）准予出口免稅。因此各埠圓釘銷路。　然激增。營業亦見起色。該廠資本初為十萬。現已增至二十萬元矣。</p>
<p>（四）該廠之組織與出品</p>
<p>該廠之內容。分組織·管理·設備·營業·出品·等五項。大致情形如下。（一）組織　依照有限公司條例。呈請實業部註冊。資本二十萬元。公司行政。取決董事部。董事部之下。設總協理各一人。下設總務課·營業課·倉庫課·會計課·各課之下。再分設辦事·總計總分廠全體職工約三百人。（二）管理　該廠全體職工。均屬久共患難。歷年以來。分工合作。從未發生任何工潮。全廠管理。以設備齊全。克臻科學化。總經理黃介輔總管樞紐。協理施禮宏。襄贊得力。各股專門技術人員。莫不勸勉有加。（三）設備　除製造工廠。管理處一切設備合理化外。凡於工業安全。職工教育。業餘運動。工廠衛生諸問題。均有相當之設備與計劃。堪稱完善。（四）營業　貨品之推銷本埠。均由著名行號担任。外埠如長江一帶。則另有特約經理。華南方面。自設分廠。統計每年營業。圓釘一項。在百萬元以上。鐵絲籬及其他釘類，等新製品。因國人已有相當認識。銷路亦廣。（五）出品　甲、主要出品。各圓釘自四分起至六寸止。他如鞋釘·銅釘·油氈釘·兩頭尖·騎扣釘·小帽釘·地板釘·方釘·以及其他各式特別釘類。乙、鐵絲籬網。各式裝置。如住宅·花園·學校·醫院·公園·球場·工廠·輪渡·公墓·陵園·湖畔·山莊·飛機場·體育場·種植場·動物園·泳游池·鐵路車站·公路護網等及鐵絲織物。如潮機器護網·暖爐網罩·信籃·花籃·鳥籃等。此外一種有刺者。專門供給軍用。即俗稱鐵絲網。丙、製釘機。該廠全部母機。除用以自造釘機。準備擴充釘廠外。兼製釘絲廠全部機器及附件。並代辦其他工程。</p>
<p>（五）圓釘籬網製造方法</p>
<p>圓釘與鐵絲籬網之製造方法如下。（甲）圓釘　（一）去銹。去銹工廠。為全廠最重要一部份。蓋原料鐵條。國內絕無出產。均採自歐美各國。當其在練鋼廠內製成鐵條時。必須經過高熱度之軋滾。待鐵條漸冷時。外表即結成硬皮。此種硬皮在工作之進程中。必須先行去除。其法即將鐵條浸入淡酸中。約經二小時之時間。再澆經清水。使之洗淨。再浸入石灰桶內數分鐘。取其工作時間之潤滑。最後始入烘房內烘燥。以備拉絲之用。（二）拉絲。拉絲工廠。即將較粗之鐵條。經過特製之鋼模。硬拉而成較細各種尺度之鐵絲。以適合其製造之物品。拉絲之範圍甚廣。包括各種金屬之條而欲成為粗細標準尺度之絲者。均屬拉絲。其方法頗有不同。該廠所拉者。衹屬鐵性金屬。該工場中所用全部機器。及附屬品等。均屬該廠自己所設計製造。此項機器之效用。雖不及歐美最新式的連續拉絲機。但已能超過日本所用之機器。全場所需馬力。計有二百三十匹。（三）製釘。機製鐵釘方法。本極簡單。即將拉成粗細各絲·製配於大小適合之釘機上。由管車者將鐵釘之一端。伸入機內。同時將機內之刀與模校准。即可開車。最小之釘。每分鐘能出四百八十枚之譜。最大者每分鐘出一百五十枚。該廠出品圓釘一項。自二分之一至六寸。每天統扯五萬磅。其他各鞋釘以及別種釘類。均有少許油漬。必須再用機器磨之。使其光滑美觀。每機每次能磨釘七百磅。需時約二小時。磨時機內放有少許乾燥木屑即得。待釘子光亮。即裝入木桶內。普通每桶一百磅。亦有一百三十磅者。此需看各地之需要而定。（乙）鐵絲網　（一）有刺鐵絲網。另有刺網機。該機專造軍用刺網為德國名廠出品。價值法幣七千餘元。該機裝置已一載有餘。因無需求之故。經未正式開車。普通刺網。為雙股線雙刺。每刺距離四寸至六寸。每圈計重四十五磅。或五十六磅。重量多少。可在機器上校准後。待一圈做成後。該機即自動停止。以每日八小時計算。能出八十圈。此項機器。全中國僅有四部。計上海二部。軍政部一部。另有一部不知在何處。（二）網籬。鉛絲網籬。係該廠之副產出品。其編織工作。由機器任之。此種機器之製造本極簡單。但裝工程。多屬人工。該廠所出之網籬。其做定貨。並附製鋼絲門墊。門墊中心之銅絲絞股。均由機器織成。但其邊框則用手工。（丙）機器部。英文名詞（Machire　Shop）機器廠。本來係凡百實業機器之製造。嗣因缺乏知識與資力。乃轉側於製釘工業。該廠此項機器。全在歐戰時。運自德國名廠。故施用十餘年來。尚能保持現狀。該廠釘絲工廠內所用全部機器。均係該項母機所製造。最近該廠又從事於小馬力煤氣發動機之研究試驗。雖已見效。惟尚未整個計劃（丁）煤氣機該廠對於發動機之製造。乃係最近試驗。其燃料為木炭。按木炭汽車宣傳已久。但製造固定發動機。而以木炭燃料者。尚未發明。現在開動之發動機。而以木炭為燃料者。尚未發明。現在開動之發動機。乃十匹馬力。一切均係該廠所設計。並製造者亦即是第一部試驗機。每匹馬力。每小時燃燒木炭約一斤。據該廠黃君聲稱。此後當再事試驗。以達簡單省費耐用之目的。然後再行供給社會。現在尚不敢問世也。</p>

<h3>管理通貨後之外滙問題</h3>
<p>— 譚秉文</p>
<p>管理通貨，在戰前罕有所聞；至歐戰時迫於實際需要，幾無不施行斯制。戰後各自雖力圖恢復舊制，第旋即有一九二九年大恐慌之爆發，貿易戰匯兌戰繼之而起，各國又相率而重趨於是途。吾國管理通貨之動機，蓋發韌於一九三三年美國實施白銀政策之後。銀策使吾市塲大受掀動，其時頗有主張紙幣停兌，集中現銀，實行紙幣本位者，至本月四日，財部明令實行管理通貨。至是貨幣問題，吿一段落，而外滙與物價之安定問題，乃爲時人所注目。</p>
<p>在未討論穩定外滙之前，請問中國外滙有否穩定之必要？一般言之，管理通貨着重者爲物價之穩定，外滙其次要者耳。—如NormanLombard於其所著M　onetary　Statemanship（1934N.Y.）一書中下通貨管理之先義曰：「通貨管理者，統制貨幣之數量及流通速度——氏名之曰Volumocity——而使其購買力穩定之謂也。」所謂貨幣購買力，有對外的及對內的之別；前者藉滙價而表現，後者則藉產價水準而表現。氏謂與外滙有切身關係者，僅爲進出口商及國際投資者，在整個國民經濟機構上殊不足輕重。若夫對內購買力買力——物價——則否是，雖窮鄕僻壤之三家邨，凡持有貨幣而欲以之換取貨物者，莫不與之禍福攸關，在理論上若是，在實際上亦。日本於一九三一年放棄金本位後，嘗一度任匯價自然漲落，然匯價如過度漲落，不但易於招致資金之逃避，抑且使貿易關係惡化，職是之故，日本終於昭和八年三月二十九日別定「爲替管理法，」實施外滙穩定。（拙稿日滙跌落之影響載商業月報十五卷二號）英國於放棄金制之初亦然，至翌年迺行穩定。前車可鑒，吾人斯時自應謀外匯之穩定。穩定外匯非一紙法令所能收效。穩定之手段。談匯兌之書，言之甚詳，而不佞以爲有採用可能者，祇有兩種，即設立匯兌平衡基金與Pegging是也。</p>
<p>現今諸國中設立滙兌平衡基金者，有美國（二十萬萬元）英國（三萬萬五千萬鎊）等，英美自放棄金本位後，即設法成立匯兌基金，結果則外匯穩定，貿易關係亦見改善。然而運用此種制度有種種困難：其一，需要鉅額資金。如英國於一九三二年四月初設一億五千萬鎊，至一九三三年五月增資至三億五千萬鎊，其額常因國際滙兌戰爭之劇烈化而增大。吾國外匯需要若干基金始能穩定，此雖一時不易估計，然爲數不貲則甚顯然。際此民困財盡之秋，何來此鉅欽？（國際借欽，又一時不易實現！）其二，平衡基金運用之結果，有虧蝕之虞，英國即其例也。以彼金融技術熟練之「綫針街」金融家，每年猶因此虧折數千萬鎊以上，爲學者所非難。以吾國情况擬之，困難更普，故有全張借欽以鎊匯方式維持滙價。而謂平準基金之制可行者，蓋亦未考慮及此耳。</p>
<p>較爲「惠而不費」者，其惟Pegging一法乎Pegging之法亦有多端，茲請言其最單純者，先議定一周定滙率，由本國政府向外國銀行或銀行團締訂契約，爲防滙價之漲落而買賣本國滙票。同時本國中央銀行亦在國內外作同樣之買賣，遇有外匯頭寸不足之時，得向締約銀行發出匯票。彼此間毋庸大宗資金授受。惟於一定期間給付利息而巳。歐洲大戰時，英鎊法朗動搖，爰與美銀行摩根公司（M.J.MorganandCo.）締約，行上項業務，奏效殊宏。愚以爲目前吾國苟行此法，旣可避免借債之麻煩。又可圖成本之减輕，較爲可取。</p>
<p>確定外滙應穩定之一點，亦爲刻不容緩之事。欲確定此問題，必須考慮及貿易，債務，物價諸方面，一九三二年英國專家會議確定滙率之法有三端</p>
<p>（甲）分析外國物價與本國物價變動之比率　將本國物價折成外幣與外貨比較，如外貨價値仍較低，則酌量使本國匯兌减低。此蓋着眼於杜絕外貨，藉匯兌傾銷作用，而侵奪本國市塲也。</p>
<p>（乙）分析本國對外貿易中原料品與製造品變動之趨勢　外滙降落，進口貿易受阻，不一定有利於本國。蓋各國在某種範圍內俱不得不需要他國貨品之輸入，其中原料品尤不可缺。</p>
<p>（丙）分析本國對外債務狀况　包括外債。本國人在外國之存欵投資諸項。</p>
<p>吾國國情與英倫雖大相逕庭，然於確定匯價之時則可以彼一九三二年之事件爲經騐也。</p>
<p>至於穩定之程度，據最近之情勢而觀，吾國貨幣對外匯價似有穩定於一先令二片士五之勢。惟此係暫時之現象而已。蓋此穩定程度，仍嫌太高。宋子文氏談片中云：「有若干人士習於近年中國高値之貨幣，或認爲目前貨幣水準爲低下，惟所應注意者，此次所决定之滙價，實係自一九三零年至一九三四年五年年中對外滙價之平均。」——五日申報。按一九三零年英匯平均爲一先令二片土七八九，一九三一年爲一先令千分之四片士，一九三二年爲一先令二片士七六六，一九三三年爲一先令二片士八二四，一九三四年爲一先令四片士一。以算術平均數求之，爲一先令二片士零九六，與現下所定匯價一先令二片士五出入殊少。然穩定於此點，是否有利？此則不能不使人懷疑者。蓋中國貨幣之Overvalue，巳爲衆所公認之事實。谷春帆氏於Finauve　and　Commerce某期中償淸：屬於英鎊集團之諸國，——包含日本印度等國——其貨幣較英國放棄金本位前大抵均貶値五衆——六零％，因此谷氏主張中國外匯亦應作同程度之低抑，以資調整。谷氏著文時，英匯約爲一先令五六片士，如貶値則應爲八片士左右也。關於此點，姚慶三氏亦云：「現在滙率似嫌太高，必須壓低若干，始可收提高物價復興經濟之效。不佞前曾建議將國幣匯率壓低至一九三一年英國放棄金本位以前之滙率，即一元約等於一先令。」（社會經濟月報二卷九期三頁。）是觀之，目下之匯價，不徒不爲低，抑嫌過高也。好在紙幣業經停兌，財部又賦中央銀行等以無限制購售外匯之職權，一切俱不難逐步改進也。</p>
<p>外匯方面，主要論調偏重於理論，物價方面之癥結則在技術上。目前物價之變動。雖云係暫時的畸形的現象。不久即可恢復舊觀。然管理通貨最易犯之毛病爲濫發紙幣，蓋在紙幣本位下公債與紙幣事實上一而二二而一者而已。財政失於均衡，則發公債，PringtingMachine加緊工作——此爲各國所慣於經騐而毋庸諱言者。財政部長雖謂十八個月內，財政即可平衡，茲尙禾獲得事實證明。考諸財部檔案，十九年度財政赤字二萬一千七百萬元，二十年度一萬三千萬元，二十一年度八千六百萬元，二十二年度又增至一萬四千七百萬元。在此外患日亟之秋，預算平衡恐難達到。以上諸端，誠屬杞憂，倘能開源節流，固無所謂預算不平衡之理。然舍此以外，物價尙可因種種因素而變動，蓋紙幣本位下之物價甚爲敏感（Sensitive），此又爲衆所認知者。欲防患物價之過度漲落，不得不建立一嚴密正確之物價指數。以爲中央銀行伸縮市塲通貨之根據。吾國統計車業興起僅十數載，至現在爲止，編製物價指數而按期公布者寥寥數處：（一）國定稅則委員會編有上海躉售物價指數，輸出入物價指數，生活費指數；（二）南開大學經濟學院編有華北躉售物價指數；（三）廣東省調查統計局編有廣州躉售物價指數；（四）實業部統計長辦公室則編有南京，靑島，漢口三處躉售物價指數；（五）湖南省財政廳編有長沙躉售物價指數。以上諸項指數編製之機關旣異。其所採取方法自不能一致，其結果更不宜作單純比較。在管理通貨運動下，吾人需要一統一的全國物價指數。如何使上述諸種指數加以改良而歸納爲全國物價指數，似亦爲當務之亟。</p>
<p>穩定物價，即穩定貨幣之對內購買力。然普通物價指數，均不能實在代表貨幣之購買力。故John　Maynard　Keynes嘗喟然嘆曰。「能眞正代表貨幣購買力之物價指數，蓋未之有也！」——TreatiseonMoney。有主張生活費指數之代表性較佳者，更有將各種指數加權平均而成一Mixed　Index，謂其更富代表性者。後者之塲合，如美國之Dun's　Index。吾國即　一統一物價指數亦無之，乘此良機之集統計專家會議確立一富於代表性之物價指數，不但爲中國經濟之幸，抑將爲統計史上增光。</p>
<p>獲得有代表性之物價指數後，尙須確定物價之穩定點，一如外滙之有穩定點。穩定點之推求，亦可倣外滙之法以過去數年間之物價平均數爲之。不佞前嘗主張以民國十五年至十八年期間，作爲基準，其理由大要爲：（一）政治較爲安定，（二）又無特殊事變，（三）工商業發展屬常態，都市經濟與農村經濟之紐帶仍未崩潰。——錢業月報十五卷五號「我國通貨管理論。」質諸高明，是否有當？</p>
<p>管理通貨，不必即須膨脹通貨，一九三一年英國放棄金本位後通貨數量毫不增加，爲最佳之例。中國目前暫時亦無膨脹通貨之必要，蓋膨脹通貨，徒以人爲方法增加新購買力，雖可刺激產業，大非細民之福也。然旣管理通貨，則可操縱貨幣對外購買力與對內購買力之差額，以謀貿易物價方面之改善，而圖經濟之復興。物價之稍事提高，匯價之稍事低抑，此吾人所曩昔希望者也。然於此發生三形態：（一）國內購買力——物價提高，若與國外購買力——滙價——之低抑相埒，則貿易仍不受影響；（二）國內購買力提高之程度若甚於外匯跌落之程度，則輸出受抑，輸入促進；（三）國內購買力提高之程度若遜於外匯跌落之程度，則輸入受阻，輸出改善。三者之中，孰爲有利，孰爲不利，固因國而異。中國之應採取何種政策，其事昭然若揭，亦毋席菩人多贅。—十一月八日時方病愈。</p>
<h3>新貨幣政策下之物價問題</h3>
<p>— 何伯雄</p>
<p>（一）結</p>
<p>財政部爲救濟今日我國經濟之危機，毅然出以决斷之手段，參照各國先例，公布緊急法令，於本月四日起，實行新貨幣法案，規定以中，中，交三行銀鈔票爲法幣，所有完糧納稅及一切公私欽項之收付，概以法幣爲限，不得行使現金，違則全數沒收，以防白銀之外流，並設立發行準備管理委員會，辦理法幣準備金之保管及其發行收換事宜；且將改組中央銀行爲中央準備銀行，集中準備，並由中中交三行無限制買賣外匯，以安定滙市，此種斷然之措置，洵爲我國貨幣史上空前之新紀元，亦可謂國民革命以夾幣制改革上之大成功，其對於國民經濟之復蘇，實有無限之影響也。近數年來，我國國民經濟，因備受帝國主義列强之摧殘壓迫，非惟無可發展，抑且日趨凋敝，自近年世界經濟恐慌日益嚴重後，各主要國家，相率改定貨幣政策，不許硬幣流通，我國以銀爲幣，白銀價格劇烈變動以來，遂致大受影響，國內通貨緊縮之現象，至爲顯著，因之工商衰落，百業不振，資金日見外流，國際收支陷於不利狀態，長此以往，經濟崩潰，必有不堪設想者。今者，財部實施此項貨幣政策，其所以謀貨幣金融之永久安定者也。惟自四日新貨幣法案公布以來，各地物價均見暴漲，然目下我國國民購買力尙未恢復，苟物價過分抬高，則民族產業非但不能按步調節與正常之發展，且大部份低薪職工階級，將不得不因物價騰貴而愈陷於困難，從茲平民生活，豈尙堪言！茲篇所述，迺說明物價暴漲之原因與影饗，及其穩定之對策，願與國人商榷之。</p>
<p>（二）何以構成物價之騰漲？</p>
<p>新貨幣政策施行以來，就此旬日來之所見，一般物價均顯見騰貴，此爲無可諱言者，考其原由，不外下列數端，茲分別述釋之。</p>
<p>（甲）由於人心不安自財部宣言刊載後，市塲人心，震盪不安，加之投機者操縱，造作謠言，將物價抬高，以當日情形而言，紗布交易所，當初開盤時，物價即奔騰狂漲，大有漫無止境之勢，標紗呌價，晨初開盤即狂漲六七元至十元，六個月一律穿出二百元關，十二月期漲勢最高爲一一百零四元，較之今庚七月十二日市情，近月紗最低至一百五十八元九角，相距三個半月，高低相差有四十五元一角，棉花初開亦猛漲三元，二月期最高爲四十三元，回憶本年六月八日市情，近期花曾低至三十元左右，相隔不到四月，高低相差竟有十三元零，其餘若日常之必需品，食米一項，亦突漲一二元，豆油漲一元餘，雜糧中之芝麻，黃豆，生仁，麵粉，小麥，及南北貨之海味，廠絲，紅綠茶，五金品等，無一不見猛漲，（見申報十一日商業新聞欄一周物價變遷）今財政部非實行通貨膨脹，而市情如此混亂，平民無辜損失，良由人心不安，加以投機者從中操縱壟斷者也</p>
<p>（乙）匯價降落之影響匯價降落爲物價騰貴之主要原因，進口商因匯率趨跌，輸入减少，進口貨價格勢必抬高，即本國之出口貨，因洋貨之進口减少，亦必在內國市塲以獨占之優勢抬高物價，是極明顯者也。據中央銀行掛脾所表示者，上月上旬始終維持對英滙價爲一先令六便士左右，美金三十七八元左右，直至上月十五日以後，對外滙率急轉直下，英匯由一先令六便士跌至五便士，四便士，三便士，直至本月四日竟跌至一先令二便士半，美匯由三十七元跌至二十九元，相差竟有八元之鉅，其他如日匯法匯德滙亦然，茲爲明暸起見，用將上月十五號以來之對外滙率，彙列如左（錄自申時經濟情報，每日中央銀行掛牌。）</p>

<p>八日　一、二·五　二九·七五　四五〇　七三·五　一〇三</p>
<p>（丙）誤解貨幣法案本月四日施行之新貨幣法案，多半未能明瞭法案之眞義，各報所刊出之標題，竟有「放棄銀本位」之字樣。關於紙幣停止兌現一則，法國現在尙未停止金本位，而事實上國內市塲，並無金法朗流通使用，英美未停止金本位以前亦然。本月三日之財政部令，即日起硬幣改用紙幣，此種變革，僅能目爲停止銀本位之一種條件，不能速斷爲銀本位之放棄，此其一。且有法幣資格之紙幣，對內兌現與否，則更與本位制度無關，例如一九二五年五月十三日至一九三一年九月二十日止，英之金塊本位制，英格蘭銀行紙幣，對內亦不兌現，而仍不失爲金本位制。今後吾國紙幣，對內雖禁止兌換銀幣，行用於市，而亦不能速斷爲銀本位之放棄，此其二。（按此點，可參閱中華日報十一日趙蘭坪之放棄銀本位與停止銀本位一文。）故停止使用銀幣非放棄銀本位也。今後紙幣發行，仍照例有百分之六十以上之準備，且組織準備管理委員會，由工商實業銀行及政府代表組織之，尙須每十日檢查公吿一次，發行審查與監督，較昔日尤爲嚴密。新貨幣政策更無通貨膨脹之施行，目下英日兩國，亦爲停止金本位，而非放棄金本位，所發紙幣，雖不兌現，蓋仍有充足之正貨準備也，此次四日各報所刊之『放棄銀本位』與『通貨膨脹』各說，均爲誤解，致物價奔騰，有恐遭，受紙幣貶値之損失，實堪發噱。</p>
<p>總之，新貨幣政策之作用，第一，實　集中現金，防止白　外流。第二，以合法之準備，發行合度之紙幣，以週轉市塲籌碼，避免市塲信用之加劇收縮，活潑工商。今後物價，固有徐徐恢復之趨勢也。至以今後物價暴漲之狀態，前途實甚危險，吾人誠有加以檢討之必要。</p>
<p>（三）物價暴漲之危害</p>
<p>經濟社會之所以重現物價變動者，蓋以其影響人民經濟生活甚深，自新貨幣政策施行以後，各地物價之顯見高漲，此爲無可諱言者，然物價於不合景氣恢復之我國今日經濟狀態下而猛漲，此種現象，若不速謀挽救，則危機之發展，正不堪言，今分別叙述之。</p>
<p>（甲）就消費者方面觀察，直接受物價暴漲之影響者，莫如大部份之平民階級，彼於物價未漲高時，所得之收入，尙且不足以維持生活，若物便一日驟漲，其生活之困難，可想而知，即以勞工而言，一方面物價趨漲，而另一方面勞働者之工資，亦爲增加，而實際土，工資增加之程度，迺不及物價漲高之程度，由是可見物價之漲高，每先於工資之增加，工資之增加，旣緩於物價之漲高，而前者增加之程度，又不及後者之漲高，故勞働者之生活，即不得不因物價騰貴而愈陷於困難，况我國經濟，久巳疲弊，國民購買力之衰退，已無以復加，平民生活，無時無處不見其難以支持，執是之故，今日大半平民，多有入不敷出者，則今後生活，豈尙堪言！</p>
<p>（乙）就產業界方面觀察，今日我國產業界，因年來受國內外政治經濟之直接與間接之影響而凋敝不堪，今後之圖，亟宜善爲保獲，恢復其元氣。吾入今日應注意者，物價旣經高漲，一切原料之價格，亦必漲高，因之生產費就此增加，若果工業品價格超過生產費而抬高，生產者因此而獲得利益，然而就經濟原理而言，貨物價格之漲高，需要即隨之减少，其减少之程度，固然閃貨物之性質如何而異，然而需要與價格，逎成反比例而變動，是可斷言。所以生產者，即使因生產費之增加而提高工業品之價格，然而對於該工業品之需要一减少，生產者即因之而受損失矣。其次，洋貨康價品之傾銷，即能軀本國之高價品於市塲之外，亦大有可能。再次，本國貨物因生產費之增加，致成本加重，苟價格抬高，則勢將不能出國門一步矣。故物價不合經濟實况而暴漲，實有危害產業界之末落，至爲明顯者也。</p>
<p>（丙）就國際貿易方面觀察我國歷來受列强之榨壓，外貨充塞國內市塲，中產階級以上之日常用品，幾何什九皆爲外貨，連年入超，其數至鉅，造成國際收支之大量出超，此爲昭著之事實。近數年來，以外匯之降落，與夫國內物價之降落，其結果足以限制一部份外貨之銷售，今者，若一方面外滙降落，另一方面，國內物價飛漲，則外貨從吾國外滙跌落方面所受之損失，而於我國國內物價飛漲方面所得之利益以抵償之，結果則我國因物價之飛漲，而反能促成外貨之大量輸入，此點至爲明顯而又重要。故今後物價之暴漲，非但能增加入超數字，又復足致外貨奪取內國市塲，而摧殘吾幼稚之產業界也。</p>
<p>（四）今後物價將何以穩定</p>
<p>物價暴漲之危機，業巳略如上述，故物價之穩定，勢爲當務之急，然物價之或漲或落，逎爲相對之名詞而已，所謂穩定，則究以何爲基準？此固不得不偕助於統計之技術矣CW.cI．King于其“Statistical　Method”中謂：「物價指數（Index　Number　of　frice）云者，就不同時期或不同地方之物價而比較以數字的方法計算其間關係之一種統計上之表現也。」物價之漲落，易言之，即貨幣購買力（The　Purhasing　Power　of　Money）之變動，可以物價指數上觀之，物價指數上漲，斯爲貨幣購買力低貶之徵，反之物價指數步跌，即所表示貨幣購買力膨脹也。統計學中，非有所謂Normal　Priod者乎，吾人苟審愼考察，尋得Normal　Prord，即可計算物價指數之基準，則此基準，吾人即認爲理想之物價穩定點」Point　of　Staibilization）。也價物價旣有一定之準則，則產業得以循正常之狀態而發展之矣，是影響國民經濟之榮枯，至深巨鉅也。管見所及，今後欲抑制物價之暴漲，而維持於穩定點在右，（按：此穩定點之規定，則歸我政府統計機關之工作，非茲篇圍範之內，所能述及。）愚以為於今日中國現狀下可能實行，有下列數策，願供我庶政當局聊資參考。</p>
<p>（甲）嚴禁貪圖暴利　商人或製造家，欲貪圖暴利而抬高市價，使一般消費者，困苦呻吟於物　騰貴之下，無論就社會上就正義上言，均不得不嚴行禁止，是則各地當局業已施行，然僅見一紙文吿而無切實辦法，亦非所宜。至以如何嚴厲取締奸商，則吾人有加以研究之必要矣。各國所行之嚴厲取締貪圖暴利方法可爲參考者，可分爲二種：第一，即政府對於貪圖暴利者，加以相當之制限，是爲日本大正六年九月一日所頌佈之「暴利取締令」據該令歸定，「政府如認定有用貪買或吝賣爲手段，以誘起急激之市價變動，而貪圖暴利者，農商大臣，即規定一定時期，戒吿其不能爲此行爲，如有遠反此項戒吿，而行貪買吝賣，則處以三月以下乏懲役或百元以下之罰金。「第二，即若有貪圖暴利者，由其被害者，出首吿發，如果屬實，則加以制裁，此法為英國所施行，一九一九年該國所頒布之「嚴禁貪圖暴利法令，」（Profiteering　Act）「如有人因商人或製造家貪圖暴利而受損失時，可隨時出首吿發，商務部調查確實，即加以制裁，荀不遂守命令者即處以五十鎊以下之罰金，一月以下之監禁，苟再度違犯，則處於二百鎊以下之罰金，或六個月以下之監禁。」上舉二法，僅作參考之例證而已，我國茍欲嚴禁抬高物價而加以制裁，，亟宜切實明定條例，及早施行之。</p>
<p>（乙）伸縮通貨　物價上漲，斯為通貨購買低之象徵，此時之對策，即在乎約束通貨之數量，及流通速度而獲得調節，反之，物價跌落過甚，則貨幣購買力，同時增加，調節之方，即在增加通貨數量及通貨速度，務使物價與基期水準相近，斯即管理通貨之能事也。通貨之膨脹，不是通貨之單純增加，乃是通貨之增加，超過通貨之需要，如果通貨之分量增加，通貨需要亦同時以同一的比例而增加，則不致引起通貨膨賬之現象矣。例如中國有五萬萬元通貨，一切經濟交易，即可以圓滑進行，如果交易額比以前增一萬萬元，則通貨即須增加一萬萬元，此種通貨增加，决不是通貨膨脹，因一般經濟界，可以消化是許分量，若交易額無增加，而通貨單純的增加，則一般經濟界，即不能消化此項鉅額之分量，結果即能引起通貨膨脹之現象。易言之，普通所謂通貨膨脹云者，係指紙幣發行額超過貨幣流通之必需量，因而有招致紙幣無限貶價物價無限騰貴之危險，例如德國於一九一三年，紙幣發行額僅為二十億馬克，因戰後數年中，實因通貨膨脹政策，至一九二一年紙幣發行額竟達八百億馬克之多，而國內物價之騰貴與幣價之跌落，遂造成空前之奇蹟。（一九二三年八月，柏林之雞蛋，每枚値五萬五千馬克，茶葉每磅値一百五十萬至二百萬馬克。）此隸弊害，人民所受病苦之深，今日猶談虎色變，因為吾人所應絕對避免者。但目前我國之新通貨政策，其目的僅在集中準備，與統一發行，决不如德政府之濫發紙幣。依照財政部所頒布之法令，凡關於法幣準備金之保管及法幣之發行事宜，均由發行準備管理委員會執行。而該委員會係由政府派員與國內銀行錢業公會之代表組織而成，同時該委員員每月應檢察準備庫一次，將發行進備金種類數顫分別公吿。此種辦法，實事求是，今後常能以穩定物價而伸縮通貨，不至有違拂民意之通貨膨脹現象發生也。</p>
<p>（丙）再貼現政策　票據貼現制度，在外國金融市塲中，英之倫敦，美之紐約，及法之巴黎，均行之已久，以中央銀行之職責，應用貼現政策DiscountPolicy）即藉再貼現率（RediscounrRate）之高低，控制市塲現金之流動，調劑金融平穩物價，其所發生之力量極大。蓋貼現率之高低，對於物價方面能發生如下之作用。（一）貼現率提高，能减少貼現之要求，即能减少紙幣之發出，貨幣供給少，物價趨跌，反之，降低貼現率，紙幣發出多，物價趨漲，因此貼現率之高低，直接能調劑通貨，問接又可安定物價。今者我國中央銀行實力已趨穩固，發行統一，且票據流通，行將推廣，則此種再貼現政策，可從茲運用矣。（二）遇外滙步漲過劇之時，提高貼現率，如是市塲各項利息之堅俏，他國資金，可以吸引而流入，外匯逎降。反之，若遇外匯跌落過甚之時，中央銀行抵抑其貼　率，各國貼現票據流入，現金輸出，遂促成相反之現象，同時國內各地匯兌，吿以上海爲標準，故此種情況之下，中央銀行之貼現政策，亦爲管理外匯之有效手段，雖然，財政部通令曾有中，中，交，三行無限制制買賣外匯之規定，買賣外匯自必須有雄厚之準備金，存於國外，或設置滙兌平衡基金，以資應付，今後三行集中準備，當可得一鉅額之現銀，以作準備買賣外匯，平準滙價之用，而貼現政策之施行，亦不可謂無補於匯價之穩定。雖然物價與匯價關係最密，外匯率高，利於輸入，增加入超，國內物價，勢必趨跌，外滙率降，則利於輸出，减少入超，物價趨漲，故貼現政策，直接又可安定外匯，間接又能平穩物價。</p>
<p>（丁）證券買賣　此所以補貼現政策之不逮者也，當市塲現金過多，利率低减，物價騰漲時，中央銀行之貼現政策，往往失其效用，斯時則拋出證券，收集現金以抑低物價，若當市塲現金過少，利率高漲，物價趨跌時，則中央銀行又可收買證券，放出現金以抬高物價，吾國股票市塲發達猶穉，然吾國公債市塲，已根深蒂固，所謂此種OpehMarketPolicy之運用，雖前未之見，是不爲也，非不能爲也。</p>
<p>（戊）公定物價　價格公定制度中，以法國制度爲模範，各國多有仿效之，此制度之中心構關，即每地方所組織之物價公定委員，調查該地方重要生活必須之價格，應爲公正合理之規定而公布之，本月六日申報載，南京首有類似公定價格制度之評定物價委員會之組織，所載者爲『本市評定物價委員會，即日由社會局之召集組織成立，將來工作，一方面將日用必需品所售價格，詳爲調查，一方面隨時禁止操縱抬高，市政府當與各機關協力進行之，云云』。此項評定物價委員會之組織，實具有公定價格制度之精神，而制限貪圖暴利者之活動，此項措置，確有益國民生計，尙望各地當局繼起組織之。</p>
<p>今後物價之趨勢，愚以爲當可藉景氣之恢復而徐徐上漲，惟最可慮者，即今後物價之不合理而騰貴，長此以往，其危害洵匪淺鮮，故今後何以穩定物價，實爲當今先務之急。不佞列舉數節，固甚粗淺，惟旨在拋磚引玉也，願吾謀國者，有利圖之。十一月十三日完稿于商學院。</p>

<h3>初期肺結核之認識</h3>
<p>— 沈香伯</p>
<p>當你自己發現到你是癆病患者的時候，這時期已經不是初期的了，換句話說：就是你的肺癆已經有了相當的成績！那末，究竟怎樣纔算是初期性的肺結核呢？本文將給你以圓滿的解答。</p>
<p>平常的感胃，似乎是一種司空見慣的現象，我國人從來沒有去注意牠的；可是，這被人忽略的小小病症，恰是各種呼吸器病的先驅，而與初期性肺結核尤有不解之緣。</p>
<p>結核菌這樣東西很稀奇，牠和別的傳染菌傳染病的方式，根本不同；平常的傳染病，大都有一種共同的特徵，如發熱及白血球增多等。這些病徵，都是極顯著的，與正常人有着很明確的差別，所以極易引起息者的注意；至於結核菌呢？牠是很機警的，牠用不着向人體作猛烈的侵襲，以致引起我們人體發大熱去抵抗牠，更不管驚動白血球戰士整軍精武地向牠迎頭痛擊。正當你在患感冒而不經意的時候，牠便魚目混珠，悄悄地溜進了你的呼吸器官，開始牠的傳播工作了。</p>
<p>最初牠很狡滑，差不多完全倣效感胃先生對你的待遇，使你只感覺到你仍是在息感冒，决未想到你已經是肺癆初期的患者。可是，牠的眞面目，慧眼人一試即破。如何折穿牠的西洋鏡，你且領會下列的幾種門檻吧！</p>
<p>（一）感胃近一月，而仍未愈者。</p>
<p>（二）身體虛弱。極易疲乏。</p>
<p>（三）體重逐漸減輕。</p>
<p>（四）夜有盜汗。偶有輕咳，但無痰。</p>
<p>（五）胃呆，消化不良。</p>
<p>（六）午後微熱，面色潮紅。（俗名肝火）</p>
<p>（七）喉發粗嘎聲。（俗名失音）</p>
<p>（八）曾患一二次之咯血。（雖極輕微，但甚嚴重）。</p>
<p>以上八條，都是初期性肺結核患者的徵候；不過，不一定每個患者都具備上述的徵候。然而當你自己檢查你已經有了上述任何四條以上的徵候，你就得馬上去請醫師診斷有無肺結核；（按肺結核之診斷，須賴富有經騐之肺病專家檢騐）。如果沒有的話，那是你的幸運，如果有的話，你就得趁早醫治，百分之百在這初期是有希望治好的。</p>
<p>何以我們要認識初期性肺結核？</p>
<p>（1）初期性的徵候很輕且無極顯明的特癥，易於被人忽視。（2）初期性肺結核最易治愈。</p>
<p>本來肺癆到了初期，才來治療，已經嫌晚了。最重要當然還在防癆。不過，假使結核菌己經把你第一道防癆的戰綫衝破，而入了初期，你就得設法老早把牠殺個片甲不回，以免牠再衝破第二道防綫，而達到肺癆第二期；假如你在那千均一髮的初期放鬆了牠，以後你就不得不做牠的俘虜了，</p>
<p>編者按：你如已發覺患了初期肺結核，或者你的身體虛弱常時易罹感冒（即傷風），有發生肺結核的傾向，應該早點治療及預防。最適當的方法，是實行空氣榮養等衛生療法，同時再服「肺活」PhithWeal此藥為「有癆者治癆——無癆者增進健康預防肺癆」的特效劑；你能積極的實行上列各種療法，就可以恢復健康，永無肺病之憂！</p>
<h3>氣喘之特效療法</h3>
<p>— 姜冠羣醫師</p>
<p>氣喘一症。自古難治。今日雖漸升堂奧。而未超絕頂。猶待學者之拾級而登也。按本症之發生。往往始於小兒時。其初起也。易受風寒。常發鼻黏膜炎。發瀰蔓性氣管支炎。有類　聲。笛聲。及呼吸困難諸症。久則發爲定型之哮喘。此種小兒。身體常　瘦細長。其胸部發達。不甚良好。然往往至發育完成。。歲前後。而哮喘宿疴。消散若失。過此而不愈者。將終其身爲不治之患矣。亦有老年始見者。四十五十歲之傾。始發哮喘。積滯終其身。然此例不多見。症狀。以高度之呼吸困難爲主徵。其發作恒以夜間突然而至。氣阻息澀。不能就枕。或坐或立。以舒其氣。顏色蒼白或靑紫。發作回數。多寡不一。時間亦長短不一。有一星期發數次者。有一二年中發一二次者。有發作一二時卽愈者。有一夜或數日而後愈者。甚至呼吸困難之苦惱。積留至數星期不去者。療法。分爲兩種（一）對於現在發作之苦惱。加以治療。（二）對於將來之侵犯。岡其預防。哮喘發作之間。大抵用鎭靜與麻醉藥。可以和解之。Chloral,（1-0）Morphin,（0-01）Opium,（0.03）皆足以奏功。然此種麻醉藥。屢用恐成習慣。非高度呼吸困難。　苦不能耐者。不宜輕用。近時醫家多嘗用「肺活」Phith　Weal奏效速。毫無習慣性等流弊。且化痰之功甚偉。凡咯痰膿厚而不易吐出者。用之更當。服後立見痰化爲水液狀而咯出。呼吸卽刻順暢。哮喘之預防法。以除去原因爲急務。有鼻病者務療治之。又用『肺活』PhithWeal長服（約連用三月）多獲痊愈者。若病症頑固。可並用三％氣化鈣溶液3％Solution　Calcium　Chdoricle之靜脈注射。每日一回。每回二十西西。注射至七八十回。頗有奇效。</p>
<h3>久咳之原因及療法（慢性氣管支炎）</h3>
<p>— 姜冠羣醫師</p>
<p>慢性氣管支炎Bronchitis　Chronica由急性氣管支炎（起自傷風者居多）反覆侵襲。遷延不治而成。凡老人與常在汚濁不潔之空氣中作工者。往往罹患是疾。</p>
<p>症狀爲頑固之咳嗽。留滯不去。患者或至不能操業。成爲廢人。秋冬之際。病勢加劇。放棄職業。輾轉床褥。春夏溫暖之時。則病勢减輕。操業如亡。數年而後。漸發呼吸困難。肺氣腫等症。而肺循環鬱滯不疏。於是左心室肥大。成瓣膜閉鎖不全之症。最後則發浮腫。面色靑紫。肝充血。　血腎等症。與心臟病者相似。病人亦坐此以死。本症之病型甚多。略可分之爲三種如左。</p>
<p>（一）（黏液膿樣性型）Die　Mucopurulenle　Form）以黏液性農性之咯痰為主徵。多限局於肺下部。大吸煙家及有慢性之鼻咽喉病者見之。</p>
<p>（二）乾性氣管支炎（Trockene　Bronchitis）咳嗽乾性而煩苦。呼吸困難。用力咳嗽。僅得排出少量之痰。痰性黏稠。若不能排出。積於氣管支內。則甚覺苦悶。呼吸困難。又有所謂鬱血性管支炎者。於心臟瓣膜病見之。症狀爲頑固性咳嗽。</p>
<p>（三）黏液性氣管支炎（Bronchitis　Pituitosa）咯痰量甚多。常至一立特（Liter）以上。其性質爲稀簿黏液性。且多泡沫</p>
<p>苦氣管支膿漏。則有强劇咳嗽。多量黏液膿狀之咯痰。若惡臭性加答兒。則呼氣惡臭。咯多量惡臭之痰。咳嗽。</p>
<p>治療法　以原因療法爲主。頑固性急性氣管炎發生時。念施根本療法。（服「肺活」（Phith　Weal）。勿使變成慢性。避塵埃煤煙等有害物。乾性者用吸入劑。祛痰劑。咳嗽則用鎭咳劑。咯痰多則用樹脂（Balsam）衰弱者與滋養物及强壯劑。（康氏生活素Conbour's　San-Vita-Cell）因心臟病而起者則用强心劑（Strophant，Digitalis等）</p>
<p>罹本病者。易受風寒。宜以毛織裏衣衣之。以防感冒。患者常居新鮮空氣之內。不可幽閉室中。嚴禁煙酒。</p>
<p>編者按本症慢性難治。患者尤以頑固之咳嗽爲苦。上列各藥皆係對症療法。無根治之效。余臨診各型氣管支炎。均用「肺活」Phith　Weal內服。其化痰止咳之效。甚爲顯著。若痰性黏稠積於氣管支內不能排出者。即現呼吸困難。胸內苦悶。服此後立見輕鬆。痰消咳止。若欲根治。患者可連服。輕病一月。久病二月。多能痊愈。如患者攝生得宜。則終無復發之虞。且服用「肺活」者。可預防續發哮嗎及肺癆。余因實騐較多。見其效力超羣。特記之以告同病。</p>
<h3>瘦弱肥壯法</h3>
<p>— 張百仁</p>
<p>凡人之身心疲憊，活力薄弱，普通稱曰「瘦弱」，在醫理言之，爲「營養不良」究其原因，乃由久病而起，或由於職業過勞而起，或由於他種原因，以及反常之生活，此外更當注意者，爲先天不足，與各種惡性疾病所引起之營養不良是也，如肺結核，癌腫，惡性新生物，巴塞多氏病BASEDOW等。</p>
<p>瘦弱之症象，大致面色蒼白，皮膚枯燥，心悸亢進，頭痛眩暈，耳嗚目花，大便秘結，食慾缺乏，消化不良，甚則足面浮腫，身體畏冷，常喜溫暖，生殖器障礙，女子冬現月經不整，减少或閉止，男子則性慾反熾，時或遺精，患者因體質虧損，筋力自必薄弱，稍微運動，則呼吸迫促，肺之換氣作用不充足，故易發生肺結核，此種蒲柳弱質，百病易犯，當用滋養強壯劑，以補救之。</p>
<p>瘦弱之補救，首須安靜身心，避一切忿怒悲哀之事，操作勿過勞，運動貴適當，常浴溫泉中，時至野外散步，多吸新鮮空氣，整理便通，食餌須採易消化而富有滋養之物品，藥劑中最有效者，首推『康氏生活素』CONBOURSSAN-VTA-CELL服用以後，無需消化器的消化，而直接吸收，製造血液，搆成肌肉，毫無糜費，同時促進新陳代謝，增進食慾消化，旺盛人體所有生活機能及精神體力，效果甚大</p>
<h3>婦女之神經衰弱</h3>
<p>— 虹口產科醫院金文安女醫師</p>
<p>吾人於臨床上。恒見有種婦女。多憂鬱而喜服藥。自以爲病入膏盲。惶惶然不可終日之勢。若詢其所苦。則滿身是病。而又說不出所以然。如頭痛神疲。腰酸不舒。畏寒失限。食慾不振。喜怒不定。疑慮多夢。心神不安。健忘急燥等。爲其普通之症候。而細察其原因。多由月經不調所致之神經衰弱也。</p>
<p>月經不調。乃婦科中最普遍之疾病。故調經藥品。亦爲婦科中不可缺少之藥劑。查市上發售之調經藥品。雖風起雲湧。名目繁多。按諸實際。其功效有吾人所期望於理論者。殊亦鳳毛麟角。卽偶有一二精品。又因價値昂貴。令人有不敢嘗試之概。</p>
<p>近有美林登西藥行獨家經理之『美奴寗』Menorrin係依照中西著名之婦人科醫院內經騐良方。集數十種珍貴調經養血强健子宮等藥。並用我國古來推獎之婦科名藥『當歸』之精華。配合製成。對於月經不調而起之諸症。例如經來腹痛。月經閉止。月經過多或過少。腰背酸痛。赤白帶下。宮冷不妊等。功效靈確異常。</p>
<p>余自得『美奴寗』Menorrin於臨床上應用以來。向所視爲難治之婦人神經衰弱症與月經不調。皆能迎刃而解。而無一不滿意。甚而有遠戚。客居他鄕。其夫人病而函詢於余。姑勸其服『美奴寗』Menorrin不一月而復書感謝矣。我國婦女之患氣血虧損與經病者特多。是與健康至有關係『美奴寗』Menorrin出。不啻爲婦女界增一健康保險也。</p>

<h3>中國人的手</h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>西方人富於腦，中國人能於手，據說這是西方一位學者說的話。他說西方人會得發明一切神奇莫測的科學，會得把一切理想的，用科學方法，製造出事實來，這是中國人所不擅長的。但是說到美術，那麼，西方人實在遠不如中國人。中國人會把楔形文字，寫成極美觀的字髒。中國人會把不規則的綫條，組成美麗的盡面。中國人會用簡單的工具，創造出偉大的浮雕來。中國人能不應用建築學，而構造成鞏固，雄壯而又美觀的建築物來。西方的文明，灌輸到中國，還不過是三百年的歷史，但在三百年前，中國卻已有非現代的西方人，所能模倣的一切美術生產品，完全用一雙手，生產出一切美術化的東西來。中國人的手，眞是世界上的任何一個民族，再沒有人能超過的了。</p>
<p>從前美國有一位大學敎授，曾就四十餘位大學生中，研究那一國的學生的字體最優美。那四十餘位之中，美籍的二十餘，歐籍和亞籍的各十人左右，其間華生共四人。據他研究的結果，前三名都是中國人。英國人居第二位。美國學生，竟沒有一位可以列在十名之內的。還有一位法國太太，據說曾收集了中國的古今繡品七大箱，凡四百餘件。這些繡品之中，有很多都是中國從前的大內之物，由各地的刺繡專家所成的。就是非天內所用的珍品，也都是繡得再也生動不過第一流畫家，都不能描繪的作品。因此，這位法國太太，雖然是沒曾到過中國的，但是每逢有人贊賞伊所珍藏着的繡品時，伊總是不住地贊揚着中國人的手。伊說：「法國人若是有了中國人的手，法國的藝術，至少再得增高二倍價値。」</p>
<p>藝術，雖然是從手裏做出來的，但同時不可少的，自然是一種構造的想像。西方人只知贊美中國人的手。而不知用腦，這自然還是隔靴搔癢之論。在實際上，中國的藝術，絕對沒有機械氣味的，絕對的是手腦並用而所產生的呢。</p>
<h3>朱鴛雛佚事及其佚詩</h3>
<p>— 愛梅</p>
<p>華亭朱璽，鴛雛，爲南社詩人，亦說苑名家；英才不祿，士林同悼；至於今日，雖謝世已逾十稔，而其生前友好，如劉鐵冷師兄輩，猶每共予慨然談其身世，爲之追惜不置焉。</p>
<p>前展社會月報，亦有文記鴛雛事，惟皆風影之談。有謂：一鴛雛維情聲色，致夭天年；帷薄不修，遺羞中籌；故當時被柳亞子所斥。」諸語。予按：鴛雛爲人，雖跡近浪漫；而夫人許女士，則殊賢慧。竊以爲：縱情聲色固有之，帷薄不修則未也！至於亞子之斥鴛雛，乃因詩戰而起；亞子宗唐，鴛雛宗宋：意見不侔故耳。如該報言，厚誣鴛雛甚矣！</p>
<p>鴛雛遺著甚多，而刋行絕少；如峯屏泖鏡錄，桃李因綠，諸說部，皆未梓單本問世。其流傳者：惟瘦鵑先生所輯之「紅蠶繭集」，兩卷而已。</p>
<p>鴛雛爲文，如：「美女簪花，姚冶可愛」。信如瘦鵑所評。而爲詩，亦別具風格，令人愛誦。頃予搜得其佚作數首，皆集中所未載者；亟錄於下，以廣其傳。</p>
<p>寒夜與了公寄父聯句云：「靑燈一尺照孤吟，（了）惻惻餘寒着袂深；雜感焉能遺今夕？（鴛）淸商况又答遙砧！欲溫綺夢衾如水，（了）似訴閒愁月抱林；樓上詩魂招得否？（鴛）枰聲俱絕夜沉沉。（了）」和了公作卽用原韵云：「微茫夜氣吹裾袖，萬里寒雲欲雪天；閱世深杯春浩蕩，破空硬筆隼盤旋；驚心風雨三更夢，掛眼江湖數點烟；獨有元神長不死，短檠孤榻證枯禪。」雜感六首云：「雲拼百里路非遙，花月春江未寂寥；惹得詞人溫綺夢，南來重見鄭櫻桃」。「春歸尙護燕雙棲，花外微風日又西；眼見碧油車過處，一回回首醉如泥」。「拈來紅豆有相思；南國繁春發滿枝。漸老何戡原不誤，要他傳說答歸期」。</p>
<p>未必風懷取次輕，噓寒問煖漫傷情；記從二度憐離別，又上朱樓望汝行」。「旁人多事妬鴛鴦，各抱痴情不可商；相見倘能傳一語：兒家今已嫁王昌」。</p>
<p>忍淚相看又此時：前言戲耳欲何之？曝書亭外輕寒透，爲詠風懷二百詩」。</p>

<p>他道；我已經打聽淸楚了，這裏可以匯欽到上海去的，不過多出一點匯水就是了。這就有一個人男子，緩緩的答應說。欵子我自然籌出來給你。只是西安城裏我沒有法子籌欽。那女人喝道：你胡說！這是陝西的省城省城裏籌不到欵，什麼地方可以籌得到欽？那局長低聲道：太太，你低聲一點。這個小西天，全是政界上的旅客你嚷出去了，我固然是沒有面子，你也不見得有什麼面子吧？隨了這一句話，就聽到隔壁屋子，咚的一聲響，分明是有人拍了棹子了。接着就聽到那女人道：我爲什麼不說？我偏要說。你還知道顧面子嗎？你若是知道顧面子，你就不靠我父親的勢力，到西北來混小差事做了。哼！你還知道要面子，你不要給我說出好的來了。那位局長，立刻發出央吿的聲音，低低的道：左右前後，都是人，你饒了我，不要再吵了。至於你所要的錢，我回到甘肅去辦，你要多少錢，我給你多少錢就是了。那婦人狠着聲音說：要我到甘肅去，那也成，你給我三千塊錢。那局長帶了笑音說：這樣大的數目，恐怕不容易吧？那婦人道：這數目就大了嗎？我不走，我在西安等着，你明天，就回甘肅去，給我拿三千塊錢來。你若少拿一個，我打電話報給我父親，敎你這小官僚做不成功。你是什麼有本領的人，寫一封八行，也寫不通。（三六五）</p>
<h3>日本的菊花展覽會（下）</h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>小菊的種植歷史，還沒有大菊中菊的悠久。原來只有一種單瓣的勳章菊，即日本勳章上的花型，徑僅一二寸，顏色很多，大都做成懸崖形。花朶繁密，盛開時不見枝葉，宛如花屏，亦有風趣。三年前靑森縣竹內氏植一懸崖菊名「薄化妝」，闊八尺，高達一丈五尺六寸，眞是海外奇談了。另有一種小菊的種植法，更爲奇特，完全用盆景方法來培養的，最近很得藝菊家的讚賞。小菊和大菊中菊趣味不同，完全在姿勢趣味着想。一棵菊花，枝桿彎曲如松柏，驟視之，莫不認爲普通松柏盆栽的。至開花時，點點秋光，又有奇趣了。</p>
<p>此種小菊原來是由山中野生的移植而來，和我國野菊花相像。徑僅三四分，枝桿較老，呈赭黑色，非大菊中菊之桿，尙有草本性質可比。種時與普通盆栽方法相同，佐以山石靑苔時，可任意佈置。常露其細根，盤旋於岩石上，宛如松根。有時倒掛垂絲，又如楊柳。形態百變，全由人工指揮之。曾見一最奇特者，以陳竹製成汲水之天平架（當然很小的），一端懸重物，一端懸小菊一稞，根部全露空中，僅根尖着於土中，居然花葉茂盛，眞是異想天開了。</p>
<p>日本菊花種類似比我國爲少，即最普通之二喬墨省等亦未見形，何况其他。故我國倘然改良種植方法，必可勝過日本的。</p>
<p>其一詠杭州，誌初相見也識得杭州萬念非，記初相見淚頻揮，靑梅竹馬人間愛，誰更倚閭話夕暉。（向人述茂漪小時情景之岳母端木菊初夫人亦於數年前作古矣）</p>
<p>其二詠南昌，誌舊遊也艶陽城郭赴章門，人面桃花證古原，朝露餘生驚歲晚，蕭殘猶有未銷魂。</p>
<p>其三詠萬安，誌舟會也曲港明漪照淺灘，疏燈明滅夜初闌，難忘第二家鄕月，水調聲中過萬安。</p>
<p>其四詠王母渡，誌鴻印也淸姿如水活雙眸，草草離旌遠上愁，白石秋聲王母渡，黃金時代溯從頭。（王母渡爲贛縣以南一小市鎭）其五詠落帆亭，誌締姻之日也傲霜佳色燦瓊瑰，綠槳紅樓相掩開，幽絕落帆亭下水，日斜風定忍重來。（時爲民國前二年庚戌）</p>
<p>其六詠大西洋市，誌茂漪辭世之年也大西洋市碧雲天，瀉地濃陰蜀錦鱗，高處欄杆曾共倚，新寒時節馬兒年。</p>
<p>其七詠安亭，Rest　Pavilion，誌生離也，愀然一夢幾時醒，猶見柔條掛眼靑，算是勞生歸宿地，夕陽柳外到安亭。（地在美國費府之干民市German-town區）</p>
<p>其八詠月桂丘，誌死別也西丘月桂影流長，花事闌珊斷客腸，惆悵撫棺憑弔日，海枯石爛有餘光。</p>
<p>其九詠虹橋，誌終天抱恨也萋萋荒塚沒塵寰，海澨虹橋渺莫攀，此恨不隨天地老，負恩情罪大於山。</p>
<p>其十詠十七之年，用以結束全篇也滄桑如夢骨成塵，指點江山迹已陳，又是椎心年十七，猛回頭處哭斯人。（庚戌十月一日締婚時茂漪年十七，實予生平第一快意事。）</p>

<h3>農村醫藥與復興農村</h3>
<p>— 殷占五</p>
<p>農村醫藥就是要把現代的醫藥推行到農村去。換句話說就是使一般農村人民。得有享受現代醫藥的機會。</p>
<p>中國有百分之八十五以上的人民都是農民。大多數的農民都沒有衛生的習慣。對於醫藥的常識更是缺乏。因此精神衰憊。身多疾痛。每至時疫流行，又無法制止。最後祇有束手待斃。像這樣受疾病之死亡者，每年都有驚人的報吿。近年來農村所以破產。以及不能復興的原因。一方面固然是由於農村經濟的恐慌。及受天災之擾折而生產不能增加之故。但農村人民沒有健康的體魄。遇有疾病。亦無法求治。因此以致民不聊生者亦農村破產與農村不能復興的一個大原因。所以推行農村醫藥。實爲减少人民疾病痛苦之機關。也就是造成人民健康快樂的塲所。其與復興農村之關係。實屬重大。</p>
<p>關於農村醫藥機關的組織。我們現在暫且不必談。因爲這樣的問題。舉辦農村醫藥的當局，自有一定的規稈。只要有相當的經費與人材。就可以組織而舉辦起來。這裏我所要講的。就是把舉辦農村醫藥時。應注意的三點。寫在下面。以備辦理農村醫藥諸君的參考。</p>
<p>（甲）辦理農村醫藥須顧及農民經濟</p>
<p>農村經濟的破產。這是誰都知道的。因此我們對於農村醫藥的第一步。必先得顧及到農民的經濟。在城市中。我們常時看到。有很多的醫院。或是診療所。以及個人醫院。他們所訂的診金。都非常之大。而所用的藥品。也異常的複雜。至於甚麼舶來品亦多喜採用。其價値之昂貴。自可想見。更有根多勢利的醫生。或醫院。視售藥爲營業性質。而無慈善之心。往往以一分之藥品。售一角之價。如此藥價。賣者取得重利。自所歡樂。而買者則怨恨新藥之昂貴。實使一般人民服用不起。而何况那些身處於農村破產之下的一般苦農呢。又怎能不使他們對於醫藥發生畏懼之心。更怎能使一般農民有享受醫藥的機會呢。所以我希望辦理農村醫藥的諸君。在辦理農村醫藥時對於診金。必從低廉。所用之藥品簡單而可靠。不用舶來藥品。關於藥金。亦須含有施送之性質。切不可專重營業。而求重利。否則農民畏懼醫藥之心理。日益加增。同時對於新醫藥的信仰心。亦日益减少。長此以往。則農村醫藥必有衰敗的一日。那時還能談到甚麼「農村醫藥」與「農村復興」的問題嗎！</p>
<p>（乙）辦理農村醫藥須注重農民衛生</p>
<p>農村人民的不講求衛生。不知道醫藥的常識。不用說這實在是件可怕的事。尤其在一種傳染病流行的時候。對於患者的隔離。排泄物的處置的一些醫藥常識。則絲毫也談不到。及至於到傳染流行。得病死亡時。則獲罪於天。以爲未可幸免之事。民國二十年夏。作者家鄉鎭江黃墟。因霍亂流行。農民不加隔離。以致一日間受染者有二十人之多。卽略知新醫之某醫生。也因防疫不愼。而自罹於毒。後經鈸江省立醫院。派醫下鄉診治。才告肅淸。我們由這一個例子看來。一個沒有衛生習慣。不懂得醫藥常識的農民。受這意外的夭亡。是多麼痛心的一回事。然而這是誰給他們的聽。沒有補救的方法嗎。誰能來負起這補救的責任呢。所以推行農村醫藥。注重農民衛生。實是一種補救農民。不致受意外死亡的改良方法。這種責任。當然要辦理農村醫藥的諸君。負責起來。至於怎樣灌漑農民的醫藥常識。養成農民的衛生習慣。除了多實行對於農民有益的衛生工作外。得利用診察患者時。多吿以患此病之痛苦及危險。此病係如何而得。得後應如何防止。其利害要怎樣才可以防止這樣的疾病。此外更須藉診療後休息時。遇有農民休息的當兒。隨豆棚瓜下。隨時隨地。都可以告訴他們一點衛生的常識。醫藥的故事等。照這樣的做法。我想總要比那些宣傳。貼標語，開會，演講等對牛彈琴的工作。要來得簡單。而見效得多吧。所以我很願望辦理農村醫藥者。須抱着「除患於未然」的決心。在辦理農村醫藥時。得注重農民的衛生。切不可祇顧治療工作。專求治療的人數增加。而忘卻預防疾病的工作。</p>
<p>（丙）辦理農村醫藥須考察農民的健康</p>
<p>一般衛生學家。常這樣地說。農村比都市好。農村有天然的風景。新鮮的空氣。充分的日光。所用的食品。皆自耕自食。新鮮而味美。在這種環境中生活。眞是心神安樂。愉快異常。……」的確。農村實有這樣的好處。所以農民十個有九個站出來。都是胸挺挺。頭昂昂地。但他們沒有健康的指導。缺乏衛生及科學的常識。往往將天然的賜與。常棄去不用。自身的健康問題。亦毫不顧及。因此身衰多病。最後而到求醫問藥。以致於死亡的地步。像這雖有強健的身體。而無相當的攝生法。又怎能不使農村人民。日趨於衰亡的地步呢。我們曉得。辦理農村醫藥。最後的目的。就是在使每個農民。都能養成衛生的習慣。很能明瞭醫藥的常識。而達到整個農村人民的健康。所以除去以上願注意的二項外。同時更須考察人民的健康程度。隨時隨地。得指示農民。吿訴人民新鮮空氣。有甚麼好處。沐浴及日光浴的利益安在。所吃的米爲何以糙米爲佳。那幾種食品內含有多量的蛋白質。脂肪炭水他合物。維他命。鐵。鹽。類。及水等與人有營養價値的物質。等等的問題。如果這樣的辦理下去。那末農村醫藥才有進步的一天。農村也才可以算是有復興的希望。</p>
<p>（丁）結論</p>
<p>辦理農村醫藥。在現左的中國。旣是一種不可待緩。而更須早日進行之亟務。則對於上述三點。辦理農村醫藥應注意的事項。實有不可忽視之勢。至於所訂診金。藥價。應低廉到如何程度。才能使農民不覺得負重。而樂於享受。則可由辦理農村醫藥當局。酌量而定。但也得顧及到當局的經費。此外在灌輸農民醫　常識。及指示農民衛生習慣。與走入健康道路時。宜用何種方法。才能使農民發生興趣。而樂於接收。除鄙人上述的幾點外。尙希吾醫藥衛生界。共同協力。努力討究。以達到農村人民。以至於全國人民。都很明白地知道醫藥衛生。驅除病魔。而走入健康之路。這樣醫藥前途可慶農村復興有望。不但農村復興有望。卽全民族復興。也有可能之一日。</p>
<h3>防癆聲中吾人對於肺癆應有之認識　（一）</h3>
<p>— 鐘志和</p>
<p>癆病滅中國。並非危言聳聽。過甚其詞。實事有可能也。試觀乎醫家調查之結果。國人之患肺癆者。爲數之衆。除花柳病外。當推斯症。每歲患者達一千六百萬人。每年死者佔一百六十萬人。平均十萬人中有患肺癆者四千人。一萬人中有四百人。千人中有四十人。百人中有四人。但據最近之統計。花柳病佔百分之六，七。肺癆則佔百分之五，三。倘就上海四百萬居民而論。平均至少有患者十餘萬人。依死亡率而推算。每年全國死者一百六十萬人。如集中於上海一隅。則不三年而上海市民將盡爲肺癆之犧牲品矣。此種驚人之事實。吾人若不急於設法防止猖獗。不特經濟上蒙其重大之影響。曾幾何時。卽滅國亡種之禍。迫在眉睫。亦必接踵而至焉。肺癆之爲害。旣如是其烈。菩人豈可袖手旁觀。坐以待斃。而不亟亟謀防禦之方。療治之道哉。古諺云。知己知彼。百戰百勝。又云。事宜防範於未然。則可知萬事無不有預防克制之方策也。所要在吾人之能通力合作。無稍或懈。則制止自屬有法。消滅何嘗不可。全國同胞其速猛省。茲將肺癆臚述於后。使邦人對之有相當之認識。然後言防。可事半功倍矣。</p>
<p>（一）肺癆之定義</p>
<p>肺癆之所以命名者。蓋昔人以爲勞損過度。傷及肺部也。西名稱爲Phthisis者。乃指消耗衰頹而言。近代之名曰肺結核症者。乃五十三年前卽西曆一八八二年德國醫學大敎授Robert　koch氏發明結核桿菌Jubercle　bacilli於肺部病處之小結核中。因之遂呼爲肺結核症。而舉世醫家所日夜研求。急待解决之難題。於是眞相大白迎刃而解。其造福人羣。厥功豈非偉大哉。</p>
<p>（二）癆病之種類</p>
<p>吾國古昔人士俗稱癆病。凡七十二種。卽指癆之種類極多。但據輓近新醫之研究。人髒所患之結核症。尙不祇此數。例如病在淋巴腺謂之瘰癧。病在皮膚謂之狼瘡。病在骨部謂之骨癆。病在腸部謂之腸結核。病在喉部謂之喉頭結核。病在膀胱謂之膀胱結核等等。</p>
<p>總之人體各部隨在均易招致結核病菌之侵入。而成所謂癆病也。然簡括之。則癆大抵可分爲四類。（一）肺癆病在兩肺。（二）骨癆。病在關節與骨幹部等處。（三）皮膚結核。（四）臟器結核。則病在人髒各種臟器中也。</p>
<p>（三）肺癆之原因</p>
<p>（一）性別　男佔3.79％　女3.82％</p>
<p>（二）年齡　嬰兒時代。抵抗力薄弱。傳染較易。小兒五歲以下。患者頗多。至壯年其數復增。老年漸减。</p>
<h3>種痘考（下）</h3>
<p>— 月祺</p>
<p>—醫學故事之十三—</p>
<p>若干年後，一件滑稽的故事發生了。那時凱脫林女王有了一個代替奧洛夫</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>的新愛人一名字叫做伐雪基可夫（Vassilchikov），是一個秀美而且壯健的靑年。在莫斯科的奧洛夫得知了這使他不安的消息，立卽動身趕回聖彼得斯堡來調查。凱脫林不願在戀姦情熱中受舊愛人的干涉，便派一枝軍隊把他攔住在路上，幷且把他幽禁在蓋金那（Gatchina）地方的官中，而她的托詞則是「怕他傳染當時在聖彼得斯堡流行的天花」。當然，若干年前，爲曉諭人民起見，這位女王曾發出佈吿，說奧洛夫巳受過「種花」手術，從此可以避免天花。究竟還是她健忘，還是她有意忘記，可就無從知道了。</p>
<p>總之，當奇納開始考慮種牛痘以防天花這問題的時侯，「天花可以預防」巳成爲流行的意見了。有許多捋乳婦，因在手上有傷痕的時候擠捋乳房生痘瘡的牛的乳，於無意中受了「種花」；她們後來都不出天花。一七九六年，奇納開始實騐。他從一個捋乳婦—沙拉，納而米斯（Sarah　Nelmer）一手上受得痘膿，把牠移植在一個八齡童，名叫詹姆士·弗浦斯的，身上。當時這男孩子的惶恐是不難想見的。彫刻家蒙脫佛地（Monteveede）所造的著名小銅像「奇納第一次種痘」，後來成爲醫師客廳中棹子上的飾具。在這里我們可以看到幼穉的受術者的臉孔因極端驚恐而歪扭。這是當然的，因爲，正和哥侖布相同，他是駛入一個新異的，黑暗的，未經測繪的海洋中去，他的身體中被放進一種毒物。將發生怎樣的結果，是誰都不能預料的。詹姆士·弗浦斯和訓拉。納而米斯二人，後來到底怎樣呢？無疑的，他們是在牛奶棚中過着平淡的生涯。我們知道他們的名字，無非因爲他們曾在一時和一個天才接觸而已。只在一個短暫的片段，他們曾在歷史舞台上出過風頭—他們的名字，他們的年齡，他們身受的苦痛，都被揭發—而過了這片段他們便又沒沒無聞了。</p>
<p>詹姆士·弗浦斯被種痘後三個月，奇納把天花噥注入他的皮膚，果然毫無影饗。在早期施術的時候，奇納對於受者都施行這樣的試騐。一八〇〇年，美國第一個種痘醫生—華脫好斯（Benjamin　Warerhouse）對他自己的七個孩子施行種痘。後來他把他們送入天花隔離院中，沒有一個出天花。一八〇二年，華脫好斯對十九個孩子施行種痘。後來他把天花膿注入他們中十二人的皮膚下：沒有一個出天花。同時，他把天花膿注入兩個未經種痘的孩子的皮膚下；兩個都出天花。奧斯勒把這稱爲「種痘史中最决定的試騐之一」。</p>
<p>因爲十八世紀天花爲害之烈，因爲當時羣衆對於「種花」的有效，已具信心所以種痘術的流行，幾乎比任何其他同樣危險同樣新奇的新醫術格外迅速，格外普遍。一八〇五年，頭腦頑固如拿破侖，也居然發出命令，叫他的全部軍隊受種痘術。至於當時敎會中人對於種痘術的意見，則可分爲二派。一派視此爲干涉萬能的上帝的意志的舉動，另一派！例如華綏斯脫（Worcester）的主敎—則代爲宣傳，竭力提倡。可是，在很多很多的人們的心目中，仍然視種痘爲可畏，有的竟說」人種了牛痘會具牛性」。有一張同時代的諷刺畫，上面畫着許多頭上出角面貌猙獰的被種痘者，正是此種懷疑思想的證據。</p>
<h3>疾病常識問答</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（七十三）肝臓和膽道的癌腫</p>
<p>（問）　人們怎樣會發生肝臟和膽道的癌腫？</p>
<p>（答）　這部分的癌腫，大都從胃癌，子宮痛，乳房或食道癌經過門脈而續發的；但也有因爲肝硬變，膽石，菎形二口蟲等的關係而原發該部分的癌腫的。</p>
<p>（問）　患肝臟癌腫之後，肝臟內有怎樣的變化？</p>
<p>（答）　有的在肝臟內的一部起限局性的癌腫結節；有的是癌細胞浸潤到肝臟的葉間組織內。</p>
<p>（問）　發生肝臟癌的病人，有什麼病狀？</p>
<p>（答）　若癌腫不很大而在肝臟的中心部的，有不現什麼病狀的。</p>
<p>（問）　普通的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）　病肝非常腫大，表面有許多結節，其質硬而起壓痛。</p>
<p>（問）　肝臟本身的機能，要受癌腫的影響嗎？</p>
<p>（答）　若癌腫壓迫膽管，或被閉塞的時候，一定要發黃疸或膽血症。若壓迫門脈和下大靜脈的時候，就起門脈　血症狀像腹水腸出脾腫，血，等等並且下肢浮腫。</p>
<p>（問）　肝臟癌，可以轉移到他部嗎？</p>
<p>（答）　往往要從下大靜脈和肝靜脈而轉移到腹膜或肺臟內的。</p>
<p>（問）　全身外表，現什麼狀態？</p>
<p>（答）　也和他部的癌腫一樣，現出癌腫性惡病質。</p>
<p>（問）　病人的消化系統，有無障碍？</p>
<p>（答）　有的。常起食慾不振，嘔吐。膽汁因阻礙而不能灌注到腸內，腸內容腐敗發酵，起鼓腸。對於肉類和脂不能消化。便秘，</p>
<p>（問）　患肝臟癌的病人，小便有什麼變化</p>
<p>（答）　小便濃厚，尿中含有膽汁色素，膽汁酸：蛋白質，而靛藍反應爲陽性。</p>
<p>（問）　身體發熱，不發熱。</p>
<p>（答）　大槪不見發熱。但有少數見弛緩熱</p>
<p>（問）　怎樣診斷肝臟癌？</p>
<p>（答）　只要依據年齡，惡病質，肝臟的變化，黃疸，淋巴腺腫等。</p>
<p>（問）　應當和那幾種病相辨別？</p>
<p>（答）　肝臟癌應當和肝硬變，肝梅毒，肝膿瘍，幽門癌，肝色蟲腫和黑色肉腫相辨別。</p>
<p>（問）　肝臟癌的豫後，吉凶如何？</p>
<p>（答）　絕對凶險。至多不出半年或一年而致命。</p>
<p>（問）　怎樣治療？</p>
<p>（答）　沒有治療方法；祇有施行對症的方法。近來用鐳光綫放射，也不能一定收效。</p>
<h3>牙齒常識問答（十）</h3>
<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>（第五一問）　水門汀質是怎樣的？</p>
<p>（答）　水門汀質和牙磁一樣是包圍在牙質外面的。上面說過，牙磁祇包圍在牙冠的部分，牙冠以下，牙脚和齒槽壁昆連的部分，就是一層很溥的水門汀質包圍着。水門汀質也算牙齒的一種硬組織，但牠沒有牙磁牙質那樣硬。</p>
<p>（第五二問）　牙根膜是怎樣的？</p>
<p>（答）　是一種富有血管和神經的薄膜，包圍在水門汀質層的外面，換一句話說，就是介於牙脚和齒槽壁中間的。咀嚼　，全只牙齒的重量，都承在這層膜上。</p>
<p>（第五三問）　水門汀質有什麼用處？</p>
<p>（答）　因爲水門汀質表面是粗糙的，所以牠用來連結牙齒周圍的結締組織，使得牙齒固定在齒槽窩裏，任人咀嚼，不致脫出。</p>
<p>（第五四問）　牙根膜有什麼用處？</p>
<p>（答）　有三種用處：（一）結連牙齒和周圍的軟硬組織；又可作爲一種緩衝地，在咀嚼時，使得牙齒能够梢稍自由移動，兼可减除與齒槽壁的磨擦。（二）製造和營養水門汀質。（三）富有觸覺，牙齒咬物的輕重，牠能够感覺。所以若是牙根膜有了毛病，牙齒就覺浮脹，一觸卽痛，難於咀嚼。</p>
<p>（第五五問）　死的牙齒，還能用來咀嚼，是牙根膜的功勞嗎？</p>
<p>（答）　不錯。牙齒雖死，只要牙根膜光好，水門汀質就有營養，能照常生活，牙齒就還能固定在齒槽窩裏，照常咀嚼。不過沒有活的牙齒那樣好。第一節蛀牙</p>
<p>（第五六間）　牙患中那種爲最多？</p>
<p>（答）　蛀牙。</p>
<p>（第五七問）　蛀牙是怎樣的一種病？</p>
<p>（答）　蛀牙或叫做齲齒，就是牙齒腐爛成洞，由牙磁起，漸漸深入牙質。若冉不制止，可蛀穿髓室，牙髓四之發炎壞死，甚至化膿，發生膿瘡，及其　疾病。</p>
<h3>止痛的醫學（四一）</h3>
<p>— 李興</p>
<p>哥羅芳　味甜迷蒙效力大，短時間使用可稱妙品，但用之時間較長則危險極大。用時最大的危險爲壓抑心臟，受蒙的人可以心跳先停身死然後呼吸停止。用大量的哥羅芳後除心臟臨時受傷外受害最大的是肝臟。肝臟受傷過重也有很嚴重的結果。</p>
<p>綠化二烷Ethyl　Chloride　與哥羅芳同性，除迷蒙作用外，噴射可作局部麻藥。</p>
<p>二炭烯Ethylene　無氣味，來去都快毫無痛苦，附帶作用最少，在蒙藥中爲最優者，惜儲藏最難，易起爆炸，管理不可疎忽。</p>
<p>愛弗汀Avertin　爲近數年中發明之蒙藥。用法係灌入大腸內。於灌入後數分鐘內病人就可安然睡眠，一睡可達數小時一切疼痛全威覺不到。用半量藥劑較爲安全，用全量劑於危急時挽救困難，用半劑外輔以別種蒙藥較爲安全。</p>
<p>伊弗盤鈉Evapan　Sod．　亦爲近年發見之蒙藥，用法係靜脈注射，性質與愛弗汀相似，利弊亦同。這兩種蒙藥現尙有研究之餘地將來希望很好。</p>
<p>以上所述略及蒙藥之實用，亦卽蒙藥學之常識。迷蒙法爲止痛科學之一並非神怪之術。</p>
<p>局部麻藥</p>
<p>蒙藥雖可止痛但用之於各種大小外科手術也多有不適宜處。局部外科小手術用蒙藥也殊不合算，例如拔牙，或別種局部小開刀用蒙藥有時身體所受之害實過於蒙藥之益。有的蒙藥氣體雖害處較小但價値昂貴實無由普徧實用。因有了這種的需求再由基本科學的發達才漸漸研究出來各種局部的麻藥，便利經濟實有遠過於蒙藥之處。從此减除人類的痛苦增進人類的幸福又進了一步。</p>
<p>常人多以科學的發明爲偶然之事，其實不然，世界並沒有一種發明是偶然而來的。雖有時形似偶然發明實際上仍是深切研究的結果。各種科學如此，醫學上的各種發明也未嘗不是如此。卽以各種局部麻藥之發見爲例，在過去雖有了驚人的發見但至今仍有繼續研究之必要。茲先略述發見經過之一二於下：</p>

<h3>肺結核淺說（七六）</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>開日光治療外，人工的光綫療法也値得一提的；此中最習見的，自然算人工太陽燈了！他也是藉紫光綫的放射，使皮膚發生染色的。對於本症一般症象，像食慾，以及患者種種主觀症象，都有轉良之效果的。進行性本症，以及溫度增高，咳血，均不宜。帶有滲出性胸膜炎合併症者，尤須禁忌。</p>
<p>Ｘ光治療對於肺部以外之結核症，是時見適應的。對於本症則還未大採用，並且也沒有優良成績可提出注意的。</p>
<p>第五節　非專門性的刺激治療</p>
<p>什麼是非專門性的刺激治療呢？像上面所述過的食鹽禁忌法和光綫治療，廣義的說起來，都可算在裏回的。此處所述，乃狹義的；這裏面大慨可分爲三類，卽：（一）蛋白體，（二）類脂肪體，（三）藥物的是。附屬於第三類裏面的，大半是金屬鹽類製劑。　間每一種的價値，以及適　情形，現在且分述於下面：</p>
<p>（一）蛋白體　我們曉得，蛋白髒的應用，係對於結核性的炎性狀態有轉良之可能的；但應用結果，對於肺部變化，並沒有多　用處。他的唯一貢獻，就是：對於病者一般狀態以及食慾之況進步，這是值得禮讀的。關於這一類製劑，幾乎是指不勝屈；尋常最習見的，有牛乳，奧倫，藥特靈乾蛋白，等；　都須經過注射手續的。此外，對於動物血淸蛋白，有時也採入治療的，這裏面所引用者，爲羊牛馬豕等，此種動物血淸注射，是有時現全身反應（高熱）的，但對於髒重增加之成績，是無可否認的。對於進行性的本症，有時也狠適應的。但患者如發生澱粉樣變性，空洞，以及心瓣缺損，腸結核，等症；都在禁忌之列的。</p>

<h3>學術研究的獎勵</h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>欲謀一國文化的發展，充分獎勵學術的研究是極必要的。頃學術研究會，建議五全大會，請特設學術獎掖機關辦法；（一）應特設學術獎掖機關，於庚欽文化基金項下，指撥的欵，備獎掖學術之用；（二）凡國人研究專門學術或致力專門著述者，得繕呈事實，向獎掖機關請求信用借貸性質之掖助，至其研究或著述成功時爲度；（三）凡國人有學術上特別發明者，若爲機器或他種創造，除政府特許專利外，獎掖機關應從優獎勵；（四）凡國家設施大計及一切興革，應預懸殊獎，公開徵求。</p>
<p>學術究研，世界各國，皆異常重視。它們國家對於從事研究專門學術者，都有獎掖辦法。研究而獲有相當成績者，更爲國家所尊崇。常見外國學者之研究學術，國家不但予以各項研究上的方便（如圖書儀器的利用及材料的供給），且給以物質上的資助。學術成功者如德之大科學家愛因斯坦（現已被逐），當其五十誕辰時，柏林市長且欲送他一所公園（愛氏拒而不受），以酬其勞。蓋學術的研究，關係於文化，至深且鉅，故國家莫不獎勵有加。這卽歐美各先進國學術研究之風之所以與盛，及國家文化之所以發達。</p>
<p>若我國，國家對於各種事業的建設，皆尙未上軌道，故對於學術研究的獎掖，也無暇顧及。因此學術研究，除中央研究院，中山文化館，及幾個學術界人士組織的學術團體以外，私人之從事專門學術研究者，甚屬少見。怎麼能不說是我國文化上一極大的損失。補救之道，自應由國家設立一種學術獎勵機關，以資鼓勵，而謀文化的發展。</p>
<p>關於獎掖辦法，學術研究會所建議者，均甚切要。尤以二三兩項，若能實行，收效必更大。蓋國人之有才學而無力從事學術研究者，得國家的掖助，便可從容研究。而學術上的發明，一受獎勵，也能增加發明者的進取之心，及引起別人研究的興趣。這對於我國文化，有極大的關係，希望當局不可忽視，俾我國幼稚的學術，得以日漸興盛也。</p>
<h3>舊同學</h3>
<p>— 章文</p>
<p>一個細雨濛濛的向晚，我從辦公處回來。因爲我沒有帶得雨具，下了車向弄里低着頭跑步，在將到自己門前的時候，和隣近石庫門里出來的一個人撞了滿懷。我不由地站定了向他道歉，那人却一把拉住我叫着我從前學校里用的名字。他穿着一件破舊的秋大衣，敞起領，在陰暗的弄里我幾乎認不淸他的面部；他見我疑遲着，就報了自己的姓氏，原來是中學里著名的運動健將老黃。我們分手將近八年了，雖然他的大名曾在各報體育版里見過，但也記不淸他進的是什麼大學，大學畢業後，彼此的消息更是杳然。在中學時代，因爲各人的志趣關係，我們很少接近，偶或在操塲上，或校門前碰見，互相點頭招呼而已。現在重逢，彷彿他鄕遇故知一般，我們緊緊握着手，默默地注視着對方，想從沉默中推測各人八年來的遭遇似的。在細雨中呆立了半嚮，還是他先開口，他請我到他屋里去坐一回，他就住在這石庫門里。我吿訴他我住在他的隔隣，不</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>覺啞然失笑。</p>
<p>摸上黑暗的樓梯，他輕聲地說：不要見笑，我住在亭子間里，聲音有些忸怩發　，彷彿這是個不可吿人的秘密似的。　這幾年中，所遇見的舊同學，沒有一個比較得意的，自己就是亭子間的老主顧，平時來往的幾個朋友，也都是亭子間的寓公。對於一個豪爽英俊的運動家，　住亭子間而有些忸怩不可吿人，我　覺到他在這八年之中或許是那樣孤獨地生活着罷。我沒有回答，等着他在摸索中開了門，我跟着他進亭子間。</p>
<p>他提亮了電燈，招呼我在床上坐了，就忙着從熱水壺倒開水，授香烟，對於他的零亂的臥室，又用說不淸的話來向我致歉，他顯得完全從粗野的學生時代中改變過來了。我向這狹小的臥室巡視一週，在床邊的墻壁上掛着幾件女人的旗袍，一個洗面架上也殘留着幾盒不甚講究的香粉胭脂之類，在我沒有問他「娶了夫人？」之前，他拍拍我的肩頭吿訴我了：</p>
<p>「娶老婆眞是要不得！有一點小事出門，家里就弄得那樣亂七八糟。到這個時候還不想回來，我又不會弄夜飯吃。」老黃深長的嘆了口氣，兩手挿在褲袋里，—這樣子使我想起存次運動會他落選了的狼狽樣子來。</p>
<p>雖然在這幾年中，我顚來覆去的生活着，因此學得了一點做人的藝術，不過在一個老同學前我是不能用那些不着邊際的話來敷衍—或者說是安慰他。在這動盪的非常時代，靑年們是直接在最前綫受到壓迫的。我沉默着，老黃也沉默着，窗外的雨絲不知在什麼加緊了，打在玻璃窗上像一曲悲哀的音樂。</p>
<p>樓梯口有人上來了，老黃跑過去開門，卻是二房東到二層樓去。他似乎感到重大的失望，又是那樣害羞地對我說：「老章，我們到外面去吃飯罷。」</p>
<p>在社會上偶而碰見從前的老同學，我總是覺得非常高興的，因爲我們是同時代的，我們的痛苦祇有自己人知道，但是一個跑跳如飛的老黃，現在已被壓成一個那樣懦弱，畏葸的人物，在這狹小的亭子間里，兩個人對坐着，我有些喘不過氣來了。</p>
<p>「好啊。」我說：「那末到我家里去吃飯罷。」</p>
<p>「你府上還有什麼人？」老黃一邊把大衣領敞起來過慮地問。</p>
<p>「一個是我，一個是老章。」我拍着他的肩頭把他拉了出來。</p>
<p>「你還沒有結婚？」他輕輕地自語，</p>
<p>「娶老婆眞是要不得！」</p>
<p>對於他的一切罪惡都推在老婆身上，我沒有回答。我們摸了黑暗的樓梯。</p>
<h3>南國雜憶</h3>
<p>— 璜</p>
<p>（一）汕頭夜景</p>
<p>夜里，海風擁抱了汕頭，這南國的小都市。</p>
<p>馬路的角落有灰土在旋捲着，五色的市招在風中鼓大着肚子，卜卜的嚮。</p>
<p>耀眼的街燈叫來往的行人多拖一條瘦長的影子。是秋天了，行人們瑟縮着，有的把雙手挿進袖口里，有的卻打斜着身子小走着。夜，是秋意盎然的時候</p>
<p>馬路兩旁的舖子過了十點鐘就把舖門排得緊緊地，不受拘束的燈光有時候亦擠過排子板偷偷地窺伺每個行人。乾菜店。雜貨店有的從中抽去一板，伸出頭來鸛望的夥計，那光景使人記起了牢監里的犯人。</p>
<p>街的那邊傳來一陣凄　的　聲，一個龍鍾的老人在胸前掛着一個皮鼓，他一面敲着皮鼓，一面報了，鑼聲，脚下的拖鞋發出瑟瑟肅肅的聲音。</p>
<p>「稷球Mee——」叫賣者肩上挽着一個長竹籃，引着聲音在喊。</p>
<p>「杏仁仁——茶，」街上驟然流出一股黃色的光，担着杏仁茶担子的老人在街上停住了。</p>
<p>「五個仙杏仁茶，一塊酥糖，二塊棗泥？」有人手里拿着一個小碗，從店子里跑出來。蹲在担邊用着熟悉的聲調對他說。</p>
<p>只有洋車夫們用手挽着車把，在街上緩緩地走着，車鈴凄淸在空氣中盪漾着，又嘹亮，又凄切，像在哭。連它亦沒有一個時候休息哪！</p>
<p>「Ｘ娟的，再沒有生意，明日米缸就要排八卦了。」</p>
<p>他們邊埋怨着邊走過去，把靜寂遺給這條大街。</p>
<p>夜，海風擁抱着這小都市，在它的長街上衝着跑着。像一隻展威的獅子。</p>
<p>（二）海濱卽景</p>
<p>當早上走到海濱的時候，就可以聽到海潮吻着堤岸發出一陣陣柔和的沙沙的聲音。沿着海的大馬路只有幾個行人在走。頭上是秋的遼廓的明亮的長空，天跟海一樣蔚藍，海跟天一樣蔚藍。</p>
<p>在汕頭對面的攀石山，孤立地落在海里。朝陽像軟柔的觸手一樣，撫摸着它頂上那些紫色的岩石。海鷗在島上轉了幾個迴旋，接着就像墜矢一樣鑽進海波里了。</p>
<p>遠處有船進港來了，異國的國旗在船上飄揚着。牠緩緩駛了進來，在半途卸下了許多煤滓，那巨大聲音衝破岸上的沉寂，接着許多跟煤滓一樣的「番客」們也卸下來了，小划船把他們載近碼頭</p>
<p>是襤褸的一羣（他們離家的時候是年靑的，現在精力巳枯竭了，媒滓樣的人呵！）幾十年的辛苦沒有給他們幸福，沒有給他們安慰，沒有給他們享受，只給他們一個破了的心，衰了的身體同碎了的希望。</p>
<p>他們在馬路上走着，沉重的脚步唱出一首悲切渾壯的歌。</p>
<p>何處是他們的歸宿呢？他們沒有家，沒有親親，沒有足以塡飽餓慣了的肚皮的東西。——他們要走到何處去呢？</p>
<p>海潮吻着堤岸，發出一陣陣柔和的沙沙的聲音，海濱又恢復了牠原來的靜寂。光景有如當年，但人呃？老衰了，筋疲力盡了。</p>
<p>「這些煤滓樣的人們呵！</p>
<h3>餓</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>從北平圖書館出來，剛走下那大理石的台階的時侯，眼睛是一陣昏花，許多發亮的小星子就循環地在前面晃動起來，走路的時侯，膽子亦好像不着地一般。自家心要明白得很，這並不是用腦過度，而是肚子太餓了，從早上九點鐘到現在還沒有吃過東西，怪不得這樣呢。</p>
<p>一走出館門，看見疾馳地來往着的汽車，頭兒就更加昏暈起來了。望着耀眼的街燈，茫然地想着：</p>
<p>「到什麽地方去吃一頓飯呢，」</p>
<p>摸一摸衣袋，裏面除開一支鉛筆同一條手巾而外，便沒有旁的東西了。要是這時候有四個銅子兒，那該多麼好呵。燒餅攤上許多剛出爐的燒餅正冒着白烟，一股芝蔴同黃醬的氣味直衝進鼻腔裏，不覺連饞涏亦滴下來了。</p>
<p>「到什麼地方去吃一頓飯呢？」眼前浮起了許多住在公寓裏的朋友們的臉來。難道他們不可以多開一客飯請我？但是這想頭立刻又被自家打發開去，因爲我隨卽看見那些慍怒的臉了。揩油這事情終不是辦法，偶而一頓兩頓倒還是可以被允許的。</p>
<p>頭上像頂着幾百斤重的貨物一般，越走越沉重了，而且騰着身子在街上走，亦越走越疲累了。望一望滾着黃色的灰塵的大街，好像有幾千里，幾百里那</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>麼長，似乎是永遠走不完的一樣。</p>
<p>「究竟到什麼地方去呢？」邊茫然地走，邊茫然地問，天色亦越加陰暗了。長街上有許多人在走，無綫電播音機正在播出許多動聽的調子，但我什麼亦不理會，只一味瞧着馬路旁邊那些小搬子上面的紫藍的羊腸，澄黃的窩窩頭同白色的山東大餅。要是能够咬它一口，那就最快樂不過了。這樣，我連那些坐在小攤的短凳子上面的洋車夫們亦妬忌起來了。</p>
<p>驟然，我記起自己裱袋里還有一隻錶，自然，這是我最後的而且是最貴重的資產。這樣，我心裏就樂起來了。我用眼睛搜尋着白壁上的黑「當」字，步伐在不知不覺之間亦加速起來。</p>
<p>終於，我懷着非常的希望走進一家當店裏，剛掀開布帘，櫃台上朝奉們的眼睛就把我的熱度降到泳點了。我小心地從錶袋裏摸出那個價値連城的錶來，再緩緩地放在高高的櫃台上，然後用低低的聲音問：</p>
<p>「這隻錶能够當多少錢？」我用眼睛打量着朝奉們的神色。</p>
<p>「你要當多少錢？」他撥了撥時針，又揭開後面的錶蓋看看之後，就這樣問我。</p>
<p>「一元錢。」這數目不多，我心里想</p>
<p>「嘿，」他用鼻孔哼出了這難聽的聲昔，同時把錶放在櫃台上。頭亦不回的說：「當四毛錢吧。」</p>
<p>一股無名的氣直衝上來，我幾乎想　過櫃台上那短欄　，給他幾下重重耳光。那奚落的態度，那傲慢的言詞，給他們那樣高的利錢，還要再受這樣的侮辱嗎？</p>
<p>我剛想抬起手，把櫃台上的錶收回來，可是另一個主意終於戰勝了，他使我用着忍耐的逺調問：</p>
<p>「少一毛錢行不行，就當九毛錢！」</p>
<p>「乾脆給你五毛錢吧。」</p>
<p>終於，我拿了五張破爛的毛票同一張當票離開那高高的櫃台。這時候，我的肚子就餓得難耐了。我小心地打算着，五角錢至少要用三天，至於三天後的事情卻不是這時候管得了的。</p>
<p>跨過那矮長凳，我在一攤買山東大餅的攤子前面坐了下來，那時候，街燈已經燦然了，正是許多大學生同少爺公子們在牟畝園的樓廳上，喝他們的濃濃的咖啡的時候。</p>

<h3>「船家女」中兩怪物</h3>
<p>（一）狐仙徐來</p>
<p>徐來，這一位美麗的人兒，在「船家女」中飾一個非常勤儉活潑的「船家女」，每天和她的老父在烟柳濛眬的西子湖中，盪着船兒過日。當太陽出山和暮色籠罩的時候，老高這位年靑的工人，在他們氣急着，汗流着的時候，便來代替着他們，　　在這美麗的湖上。</p>
<p>每朝每晚，老高上工散工的時候，便是他們唯一的友伴了。</p>
<p>徐來，感到老高的誠懇，情苗已經在不知不覺中抽發，黑夜，在微星下，她偷偷地跑到老高的窗前，這時老高正在補着破了的衣服，男人是不會做針線的，一針觸出了血，這使徐來在窗外暗地裏偷笑着。當老高跑出門外，打着狂吠着狗的時候，徐來將他破了的衣服，偷偷地拿出來，替他補好，第二天天色微明時，才送了進去。這可使老高奇怪了，不單這，他的破襪之類，也常常神不知鬼不覺地被補好了的，有一天，他遲回去了一點，到家的時候，飯也給燒好了，甚至於亡母靈前的香也給燒了。但這個秘密，後來終於給老高發現了，他對徐來驚喜地說：「原來是你呀！我以爲是狐仙呢？」</p>
<p>這一段，在沈西苓的導演手法處理之下，有趣極了，觀者沒有」個不爲它笑痛肚皮的。</p>
<p>（二）瘋人老高</p>
<p>這世界上有許多熱情和正義感的靑年，他們的行爲，是被一般閒情逸致的人們，當作瘋子的，當高占非在「船家女」中，集合工人要求工廠復工，而竟被資方捉進了牢獄。待他無罪開釋的時候，可是人事皆非，世界已走了樣，他最親愛的徐來父女已不見了。——這時徐來已經被迫作了人們的爼上肉，墮溷花，當他知道了這消息，衝進了妓院，徐來幾乎已變成了一個活屍，任人玩弄，他的眼前是些昏天黑地，喪心病狂的狂意兒，他再也忍受不住了，將妓院的一切搗毀，高呌着：「打出地獄去，這兒是地獄，你們都不是人，你們都是吃人的豺狼，我要打破這地獄！」</p>
<p>於是又被人捉進了牢獄，而第二天報紙的新聞版上，登載着的是「瘋人大鬧妓院」。</p>
<p>一家人在淘氣：爲着是秦桐最看不起王引，而袁美雲卻偏去愛上他。</p>
<p>——這是「花燭之夜」一塲面</p>
<h3>「時勢英雄」前奏</h3>
<p>即將在本外埠各頭等戲院與渴望已久的世人行見面禮的全部對白有聲歌唱鉅片「時勢英雄」，是藝華公司最新最偉大最名貴的出品，也正是應雲衛並其他諸技術人員及藝人瀝盡一年心血始克完成的最有藝術價值，最有社會意義的最榮譽貢獻。它像一枚炸彈，炸毀了中國電影的一切障礙，又像一聽響雷，提高了中國電影的技術水準。</p>
<p>「時勢英雄」是一部問題劇，它從世界第一次大戰寫起直到了即將來臨的第二次大戰爲　，用着尖銳的手法描寫了中國經濟市塲的起伏，更用着牟利的技七、解剖了中國資本與國際資本的　爭狀態乃至中國社會因此所受之影響。這中間，有中國資本的明爭暗鬪，國際資本的乘機侵蝕，軍閥的橫行，銀行家的活動，市僧的跋扈等，劇情的展開極盡變化萬千，高潮起伏又如狂風暴浪。因此，它的的確確是一齣富有絕大刺激力量的替商工界呼寃的問題戲劇，同時更是一部提高中國電影技術水準的光榮記錄。</p>
<p>現時，它是快要公映了。這裏謹以至誠的態度來向你們介紹這一部無上偉構「時勢英雄」，更請你們看了以後，忠實的下個批評，究竟什麼地方及不上舶來的歐美影片？</p>

<h3>Matsuoka Returns Home; Operating Policy of Mantetsu</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Because of establishing a new operating policy for Mantetsu (South Manchuria Railway) in the transitional period, President Matsuoka of Mantetsu has been working with the Kwantung Army, "Manchukuo," and local Mantetsu personnel for about three months since taking office, carefully negotiating, completing the budget for the eleventh year, and establishing a five-year plan for the operation of Mantetsu in the north for the fifteenth year. Now, because of the work for the central government, he arrived in Tokyo at 9:30 this morning. Before arriving in Tokyo, President Matsuoka spoke in the car as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The reorganization of Mantetsu does not mean dismantling or splitting Mantetsu, but reforming the structure of Mantetsu. (2) The issue of railway unification is to unify the management and transportation of the Railway Bureau and the Mantetsu Railway Department, and to rationalize management and reduce expenses, rather than a more thorough unification. (3) Compiling the budget is not so much a tightening, but rather a tightening due to expansion. The business expenses of Mantetsu itself must be made regularized and supplemented by the retention of the company. (4) Starting the North China economy, the military is active on the surface, and Mantetsu is only behind, but there is no specific policy yet, so there is no development expenditure in the budget for the next year.

<h3>Puppet Organization to Control Foreign Exchange Will Be Implemented on December 10th</h3>

<h3>Japan Sets Up a Consulate General in the Capital of India; Rejected by the British Government</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) At a time when relations between Britain and Japan are becoming increasingly strained due to Anglo-Chinese cooperation in reforming the Chinese currency system, the British government has now disregarded the previous agreement between Japan and India and refused to allow Japan to establish a consulate general in Delhi, the capital of India, causing the Japanese sentiment towards Britain to worsen. India has a population of 350 million, and its trade relations with Japan are also important, and it also needs attention in political affairs, so the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to exchange political envoys between Japan and India. When the Japan-India Agreement was concluded in Showa 8 (1933), Representative Sawada and Wellington, the Chief Secretary of India's Governor-General, agreed that the Indian side would gladly agree to the exchange of envoys. However, India has no diplomatic power, so it hoped to send a high-ranking official equivalent to a minister, but Japan could not establish a high-ranking official in terms of the official system, so it decided to send a consul-general at the ministerial level to handle Japan-India negotiations, and with the support of the 67th Parliament, it was decided to establish a consul-general in Delhi, the capital, in January next year (formally transferring the Calcutta Consulate General). The Indian government also submitted a request to the British government for approval, but the British government refused, citing the reason that the consul-general who established a trade organization was not allowed to be established in places other than trade ports. However, the consulates general of Afghanistan and Iran are allowed to be established in Delhi, so there is no reason to refuse Japan. In short, fearing Japan's southward advance of East Asianism, it intends to reject the political rapprochement between Japan and India. The attitude of the British government will only intensify the confrontation between Britain and Japan in East Asia. (Denttsu telegram on the 24th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Fiftieth Day of the Italo-Ethiopian War</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>The Italo-Ethiopian War. It has been fifty days since it broke out. The Italian side initially estimated that the war's advance could be achieved in one fell swoop. The results have completely proven its miscalculation. How many days this war will drag on and what kind of situation it will develop into is still difficult to say. Let us briefly summarize the war situation in the past fifty days in three aspects.</p>
<p>First. In military terms. Although the Italian army's aerial bombing and the use of tank tactics have caused some terror, the Ethiopian army has adopted guerrilla tactics to contain the enemy's progress. At the same time, it did not suffer major losses itself. On the northern front. The Italian side used the air force as the main force. The bombing was the most intense. However, the Ethiopian dead were all old, weak, women and children. This only showed the inhumanity of the Italian army. In fact, the occupation of Adigrat, Adwa and even Mek'ele. The Ethiopian army almost all withdrew automatically. The sacrifice of soldiers was very small. Because the terrain on the southern front is relatively flat. The Italian side used tanks as the main force. However, the front line has been extended very long. Also, due to many days of rain, the climate is humid. Many Italian soldiers are sick. Until now. The Italian army has not occupied Harar. Achieving the goal of cutting off the railway line. Mussolini has replaced the commander of the northern front, Taibono, due to the unsuccessful war plan. He advocates adopting a rapid advance strategy. Probably in the near future. The Italian army will begin a large-scale main battle with the Ethiopian army led by General Westum. In the mountains. The Ethiopian army has the advantage of timing and location. Although the Italian army has planes and artillery. It is very difficult to win.</p>
<p>Second. In diplomatic terms. The Italian side's military setbacks have caused greater international pressure on it. From the 18th of this month. More than 50 member states of the League of Nations. Began economic sanctions against Italy. Although the Italian government has expressed toughness. However, the domestic financial economy has been stretched thin. The blockade of Ethiopian arms has been opened. Ethiopia has received this convenience. The resistance will be further strengthened. Now Britain is concentrating a huge fleet. Demonstrating in the eastern Mediterranean. While continuing to win over France. Using diplomatic means. Hoping to end the war as soon as possible. However, it is very doubtful what methods Britain and France can use to make Italy and Ethiopia agree to a ceasefire.</p>
<p>Third. In terms of the spirit of national struggle in Ethiopia. The experience of the past fifty days. Has created a glorious record. Ethiopia has mobilized the strength of the entire nation to resist the Italian army's invasion. Men and women, even prisoners. All worked together. Standing on the front line of the struggle. In a document to the League of Nations on the 20th of this month. It said. "We can proudly say that except for Gogsa, no Ethiopian chief has been bought by the enemy." This shows the unity within Ethiopia. The document also said. "The Ethiopian government and people will fight to the death. Regardless of the cost and time of the war. To get rid of the rule of barbarians." This is such a firm statement.</p>
<p>From the experience of the Ethiopians resisting the enemy for the past fifty days. We can know that they will be able to continue to resist. Maintain the final victory. We feel. What has been shown in these short fifty days. The spirit of the Ethiopian national liberation struggle. It is already very precious.</p>

The line will have 18 aircraft, and the flight speed will be 180 miles per hour. This move is another step for Italy to penetrate into Africa through Ethiopia. The line will also be extended to Italian Somaliland. From Europe, it will pass through Greece. Egypt, Sudan, etc. Aviation authorities say that Italy has signed a ten-year contract with the above-mentioned countries. The existing route from Khartoum to Asmara will be increased by eight new aircraft, specifically for mail transportation. Because after 200,000 Italian troops and workers suddenly came to Italian Eritrea, the amount of mail has far exceeded the past, and the mail carried on the original passenger planes is only twice a week, limited to 1,000 pounds each time.

<h3>Netherlands Strengthens National Defense</h3>
<p>Constructing Two New-Type Submarines to Be Assigned to the East Indies Fleet</p>
<p>The Hague The Netherlands has begun to increase its national defense strength, and has decided to build two new-type submarines to be assigned to the East Indies fleet. The structure of the two submarines will be of the K-type. One of the K-type submarines recently completed a long-distance voyage of 23,000 miles around the world. The newly appointed commander of the East Indies fleet, Colonel Fowlerda, personally went to the United States to inspect the navy, so it is expected that the strength of the fleet will be increased.

<h3>Italian Army Native Troops Defect: Ethiopian Army Recaptures Two Towns in the South: Advancing Rapidly Southeast in Three Routes: Italian Northern Army Consolidates Positions</h3>
<p>(London) The Italian army on the Northern Route has temporarily stopped advancing due to the change of command. General Graziani on the Southern Route is now being pressed hard by the Ethiopian army. According to the Ethiopian authorities, the Ethiopian army has achieved important victories in this area. Harar received a report today that the Ethiopian army had recaptured the cities of Golahei and Annal. The defeat of the Italian army in Golahei was reportedly due to the fact that the native soldiers in the Italian army opposed being placed on the front line to fight, so they defected to the Ethiopian army. The Italian commander killed 30 rebels, and the crowd obeyed. After the Ethiopian army recaptured Annal, its outposts advanced seven miles south without encountering Italian soldiers. At the same time, the residents of Harar are still migrating, and most of them are moving to the town of Diredawa on the railway from the Ethiopian capital to Djibouti. According to news from Asmara, the Italian army on the Northern Route may not attack for a while, not only because of the change of commander-in-chief, but also because it urgently needs to consolidate its positions and ensure the stability of its transportation lines. The Italian army is now holding a winding front line of hundreds of miles with about 150,000 people, starting from British-Egyptian Sudan and ending in Asbi, Azbi. However, the only truly solid section is 20 miles of the crescent shape ten miles south of Magar. Ethiopian General Ayllu is now attacking the right wing of the Italian army. The troops of Westum are avoiding direct contact with the Italian army and are now conducting guerrilla warfare in the Dambean Highlands. The Italian army is now hoping that Ethiopian General Gayin will rebel and surrender to the Italian side, and his son Ayllu can be expected to follow in his footsteps. In this way, the road directly to Lake Tana can be opened. It is said that General Gaza has 125,000 people. The Ethiopians firmly believe that he will fiercely resist the Italian army in Amba Aradam and show his power. (Reuters dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>Harar Today, this office received a semi-official message that the Ethiopian army on the Southern Front has retaken Gabileitae. It is reported that the Ethiopian army is now advancing in three routes, totaling 25,000 people. According to the report received by the Ethiopian army headquarters, the Ethiopian army's advance is quite favorable. It seems that it has retaken Golahei without fighting. It is believed that the Ethiopian army will now detour east of Walwal or advance rapidly south to join up with other Ethiopian armies. The news of the Ethiopian army's advance has not yet been confirmed, but everyone who hears it is deeply surprised and does not know what strategy the Italian army has. It is probably that the Italian commander has ordered the forward enemy to retreat eastward so that after the Ethiopian army advances south, it can cut off the Ethiopian army's return route. (Reuters dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<p>(Rome) It has been denied by the Information and Propaganda Department that the Ethiopian troops have recaptured the city of Golahei in the Wogahen Province on the Southern Route and that the indigenous soldiers under the Italian army mutinied when they were advancing on the city of Dagaap, and killed 30 Italian soldiers. (Havas dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Italian Army on the Southern Route: There Are Two Reasons for Remaining Stationary</h3>
<p>Harar, from our correspondent Lavoyate. According to news from the Ethiopian side, the Italian army on the Southern Route is now 60 kilometers south of Dagapo. People generally believe that the reason why the Italian army is remaining stationary is twofold: (1) The Ethiopian army is firmly defending Dagapo and is now reorganizing its troops and concentrating its forces in the hope of launching a full-scale attack. (2) General Taistay, the son-in-law of the Ethiopian Emperor, concentrated 50,000 members of the Arussi tribe army in the city of Dollo in the south and has set off for the city of Harar, preparing to flank the Italian army. It is heard that the Italian army intends to wait until the troops led by Taistay arrive and then defeat them before attacking Dagapo. The Ethiopian army can easily boost morale during this time when the Italian army stops advancing. (Havas dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Rome Gazette: Ethiopian Tribes Surrender to Italian Army</h3>
<p>(Rome) The surrender of various tribes in Wogahen Province on the Southern Route of Ethiopia to the Italian army has been confirmed by the Gazette. It is said that Hussein Haile, the chieftain of the Rahanweyn Ral Hussien tribe, is willing to lead 2,500 soldiers of the original tribe to join the war. The Maga Shirelle Leermi and Seger Wassien tribes have also pledged their allegiance. In addition, Ahle Kerim Mohammed, the chieftain of the Rahanweyn tribe, is cooperating with the Italian army authorities in Ga El Al, and will apply the Wogahen Binba to [illegible] and retreat 1,000 Italian army rifles. Since [illegible] countries [illegible], the southern and central parts of Gahen Province have been taken over by the Italian army. (Havas dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Resisting Foreign Aggression: The People of Abyssinia Unite and Rise Up to Defend Their Emperor</h3>
<p>(Paris) It was rumored that the Emperor of Abyssinia recently flew to Harar Province because some key military officers harbored rebellious intentions, and he went there in person to stop them. The Abyssinian Embassy in France has denied this, stating that apart from the rebel general Gugsa, no military officers in Tigray Province have been in contact with the Italian army. Since the outbreak of war between Italy and Abyssinia, Abyssinia has been united in spirit, and the people are loyal to their Emperor. This visit to Harar Province has proven this. "Since the brave resistance of the Abyssinian army, the majority of residents in Italian Eritrea and Somaliland have risen up upon hearing the news and are returning to Abyssinia." This cannot be concealed by the Italian authorities. The Italian authorities in Eritrea have ordered strict punishment for anyone suspected of defecting from Italian jurisdiction, as can be seen. (Havas Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Italy Builds Air Force Base Near Harar City</h3>
<p>Special Correspondent Orchanat of this Newspaper in the Abyssinian Capital reports: Rumors here say that the Italian army is building an air force base at the foot of the Qulqule Mountains west of Harar City. All necessary materials are being transported by aircraft. News from the port of Assab in Italian Eritrea says that the indigenous people under the chieftain of the Wossa area clashed with the regular Abyssinian army there. The Abyssinian government has denied this, saying that the Wossa area is a barren desert unsuitable for habitation, and Abyssinia has never stationed a regular army there. The claim of a conflict is therefore baseless. In addition, several journalists recently arrived here by car from Dessie City, taking the route used by mule caravans. After a difficult three-day journey, they reported that the area was peaceful and that although the men had all left to join the army, only a few women and children remained in the villages, and everything seemed unaffected by the war.

<h3>Military Conference in the Abyssinian Capital: Strictly Guarding Against Enemy Espionage</h3>

It is also reported that France has taken this step because Italian Prime Minister Mussolini strongly opposes the embargo on oil. (Havas News Agency Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Italy Refuses to Participate in Two Geneva Conferences: Retaliatory Action Against League of Nations Sanctions; Discussion of the Allocation of Council Seats Postponed Until Next January</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Council of the League of Nations passed a resolution on September 26th, entrusting a committee composed of fourteen countries—Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada, China, Spain, France, Iran, Italy, Peru, Poland, Sweden, and the Soviet Union—and chaired by Italian representative Rocco, to discuss the allocation of seats on the Council, especially China's request for a non-permanent seat. The meeting, originally scheduled for next Monday, has been postponed until next January due to the Far Eastern situation and the failure of the Italian representative to arrive. The Italian government has notified the League of Nations through diplomatic channels that Rocco is unable to come to Geneva. It seems that it is better to postpone the meeting than to negotiate with the Italian government and be rejected. League of Nations officials believe that Italy has already decided to boycott the League of Nations during the period of sanctions, as evidenced by its refusal to participate in the International Maritime Conference (scheduled to be held in Geneva on November 29th) and its refusal to send representatives to the Council committee. This decision was passed by the Fascist Party's Supreme Council but has not been officially announced. Regarding the International Maritime Conference, Italy has notified the International Labor Bureau that the various reforms proposed by the conference have already been enacted into law by the Fascist government, so there is no need to send representatives to attend. However, this reason is not sufficient, as France, for example, has implemented an eight-hour work system in its shipping industry but is still sending representatives to participate.

<h3>United States Supports the League of Nations: Cuts Off Supply of Scrap Iron to Italy; Cotton Added to Embargo List</h3>
<p>(Washington) The United States Maritime Commission today prohibited the sale of obsolete ships with which it has financial ties to Italy. This move is intended to cut off the supply of scrap iron to Italy. The Maritime Commission found that two of the three obsolete ships had already been sold to Italy to be dismantled and the scrap iron refined into steel. The sale of the third ship was stopped in time by President Roosevelt's announcement of a moratorium. (Havas Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) Cotton, as an item, is not a war material and is therefore not subject to the U.S. Neutrality Act, which prohibits its transport to belligerent countries. However, President Roosevelt has issued warnings to American merchants that they must bear the responsibility for any difficulties encountered in trading with belligerent countries, including cotton merchants. The U.S. government is now considering adding this item to the embargo list and is studying the best way to do so. (Havas Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull stated today that if an abnormally large amount of cotton continues to be exported from the United States to Italy, the government will formally take measures to limit it. According to Commerce Department figures, cotton worth a massive US$3,423,987 was shipped to Italy in October, compared to only US$2,004,293 in September. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Italy Protests Sanctions: Soviet Union's Verbal Reply—Fulfilling Treaty Obligations Does Not Harm Friendship with Italy</h3>
<p>(Moscow) On November 11th, the Italian government presented a memorandum to Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov. On November 22nd, Litvinov gave a verbal reply to Italian Ambassador Baron De Valentini, stating: "Your Embassy, on the instructions of your government, advises the Soviet Foreign Ministry to reconsider and express opposition to the resolutions made by the League of Nations Assembly and the League of Nations Sanctions Coordination Committee regarding the Italo-Abyssinian War. According to your government, these resolutions are neither legal nor fair. Your government does not believe that the Soviet government has the right to individually interpret the League of Nations resolutions that have been participated in by more than fifty countries, since Italy is also a member of the League of Nations and can directly inquire about any issues with the League. As for the Soviet Union's participation in the aforementioned resolutions, our representative in Geneva has provided full and clear explanations each time. The reasons why the Soviet Union voted in favor of these resolutions are as follows: The Soviet Union has absolutely no animosity towards the Italian people, and its original intention to maintain and develop friendly relations with your country has not changed in the slightest. From the perspective of the nation itself, the Soviet Union has no connection to the Italo-Abyssinian conflict and its consequences. The Soviet Union's participation in the discussion and resolution of this conflict is purely in its capacity as a member of the League of Nations. The Soviet Union firmly implements its policy of peace and accepts the Covenant of the League of Nations. According to Article 10 of this Covenant, respect for the political independence and territorial integrity of each member state, and according to Article 16, any country that violates these principles is obligated to certain obligations. Some believe that Abyssinia is an exception and should not enjoy the rights enjoyed by other member states of the League of Nations. The Soviet government believes that this is incorrect. From the perspective of the Soviet government, member states of the League of Nations should enjoy full and equal rights if they are attacked by others, regardless of their race or other differences. The Soviet government believes that since the moment the Covenant's Article 12 is proved to be violated, member states of the League of Nations have no right to evade the various obligations stipulated in Article 16. "If we speak of the purely legal nature of the Coordination Committee, the Committee is imposing (without increasing) sanctions on Member States within the exact spirit of Article 16. The Soviet Government representative in Geneva voted to endorse this concept and the Soviet Government has also endorsed the measures which have been passed unanimously by the members of the League of Nations, for not doing so would be to deny the principles of the League of Nations, cancel the collective security organization, encourage future acts of aggression and deny the possibility of international solidarity, upholding and consolidating world peace. But the policy of the Soviet Government and its participation in the League of Nations are based on the maintenance of world peace. The Soviet Government is pleased to hear that the Italian Government has sought as far as possible to prevent the emergence of new crises under current conditions and would like to express that this bloody conflict should be stopped soon so as to prevent its ill-effects. At the same time, the Soviet Government hopes that the fulfillment of its national defense obligations will not affect Soviet-Italian friendship". (TASS Telegram, 24th)</p>
<h3>Saving Kerosene Consumption: Italian Alcohol as Alternative Fuel</h3>
<p>(Rome) The government has recently issued an order stipulating that alcohol should be used as fuel. All alcohol producers should deliver the goods produced in 1935-36 to kerosene importers or kerosene producers to mix with kerosene as fuel, thereby reducing the use of kerosene. The proposal to ban the transport of kerosene to Italy is being discussed by various countries. (Havas Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Austrian Restoration Movement: France, Germany, and the Little Entente Firmly Oppose; Italy Expresses Sympathy; Britain Does Not Clearly State Its Position</h3>
<p>(Vienna) This newspaper's correspondent has learned that the imperial movement within Austria is progressing very intensely. The monarchists are now instigating many demonstrations here, which are also being attended by Chancellor Schuschnigg and Vice Chancellor Prince Starhemberg. However, on the foreign front, there seems to be quite a bit of resistance. Britain has not expressed a clear attitude, but France has always opposed the restoration of Austria, and its attitude is especially aligned with that of the Little Entente countries. Italy's attitude is not firmly opposed. Moreover, a certain nobleman from the Habsburg imperial family of Austria is married to an Italian princess, so it would not be appropriate to obstruct it. The Little Entente countries oppose the restoration as they always have. As for Germany, it is also strongly preventing the realization of the restoration in Austria. Recently, French Ambassador to Germany Poncet and German leader Hitler discussed the issue of Austrian restoration. However, Germany firmly insists on maintaining the current administrative system in Austria, believing that this is a prerequisite for seeking a German-Austrian "truce." (Havas Dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>British Coal Miners Decide to Strike: Demand Wage Increase Until Goal Is Reached; Government Authorities Seek Mediation</h3>
<p>(London) The majority of coal miners have decided to strike nationwide, demanding a wage increase of two shillings. Except for the Lancashire mine owners, who suggested that wages could be appropriately increased when the central sales agency is established and the coal industry can profit, other mine owners have not provided a concrete response. Prime Minister Baldwin has asked the executive committee of the miners to meet with Mining Minister Crookshank on Wednesday. Therefore, important actions will begin on Wednesday. At the same time, the miners' executive committee will discuss with the Trades Union Congress the possible plans arising from the Trades Union Congress's resolution in September to provide maximum assistance to the miners to achieve their goals. After meeting with the miners' executive committee, the Mining Minister will call on representatives of the mine owners. It is likely that the miners will argue that the mine owners everywhere should follow the lead of the Lancashire mine owners. However, the mine owners have a strong stance and are unwilling to agree to a nationally consistent approach, while the miners are unwilling to accept the suggestion of handing over the issue to the mine owners' trade associations in each coal region, as this will delay the matter and create other difficulties. The two sides are deadlocked on this matter. If the government cannot break this deadlock, Britain is likely to experience a very serious labor unrest. (Reuters Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Dr. Sven Hedin: Lecture on Exploration in Central Asia; Significant Achievements</h3>

A plane was sent here to scout out the area in order to provide rescue. It was discovered that 54 fishermen were stranded on the ice blocks, suffering from hunger and cold and on the verge of drowning. The plane landed on the ice block, distributed the food it carried to the fishermen, and took an eight-year-old child ashore. It is generally believed that a large group of fishermen were trapped by the ice blocks and are drifting in the sea. (Havas Dispatch, 24th)</p>

<h3>Li Yu Talks About the Current Situation of the Guizhou-Yunnan Highway</h3>
<p>Jiang Orders the Completion of the Guizhou-Hunan, Guizhou-Sichuan, and Guizhou-Yunnan Highways by the End of the Year</p>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: Li Yu, Deputy Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau and Chief Engineer of the Highway Office of the Provisional Headquarters, has been in charge of highway construction in Guizhou, Yunnan, and other provinces for quite some time. He recently returned to Zhejiang from Guizhou. According to him, the recent progress of the major southwest highways is as follows:</p>
<p>Guizhou-Yunnan Highway</p>
<p>This highway starts from Guiyang, passes through Lushan, Zhenyuan, and Yuzhan, and reaches Huangxian, Zhijiang, Chenxi, Yuanling, Taoyuan, and Changde in Hunan Province, and then Changsha. The entire line is about 900 kilometers long. Among them, the 500-kilometer section from Changsha to the border of Hunan Province, which was supervised by the Highway Office of the Provisional Headquarters, was officially opened to traffic in August of this year. Bridges and culverts have been completed, and the paving of the road surface will be completed by the end of the year. The section from Guiyang to Lushan was repaired during Zhou Xicheng's rule in Guizhou. The 380-kilometer section from Lushan to the border of Guizhou was recently built and opened to traffic by the Guizhou Provincial Highway Bureau. However, this area is characterized by thousands of mountains and towering peaks, and the road surface is entirely paved with crushed stones. It is not only rough and uneven, but the degrees of the curves and slopes are also unsuitable. It is easiest for vehicles to encounter dangers, and traffic will be obstructed in rainy weather. The Guizhou-East Section Rehabilitation Engineering Office has now been established by the Highway Office of the Provisional Headquarters to be responsible for the rehabilitation work, so as to meet the driving requirements. This will require approximately 500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Guizhou-Sichuan Highway</p>
<p>This highway is 537 kilometers long and starts from Guiyang, passes through Zunyi and Tongzi, and reaches Gongjiang and other places in Sichuan Province to reach Chongqing. The Sichuan section is 177 kilometers long, and the Guizhou section is 360 kilometers long. Both provincial authorities have stepped up construction and sent engineering troops to participate in the work. Both sections have now been completed and opened to traffic. However, the construction work is extremely hasty. When Mr. Zeng (Yangfu) and Mr. Wu (Zhongxin) traveled from Guizhou to Sichuan via this road, they should have been able to arrive in two days based on the mileage. However, due to poor construction and difficult driving, manpower was required to push the car along the way, and it took six days to reach Chongqing. Therefore, the Guizhou-North Section Rehabilitation Engineering Office has now been established to improve the curves, slopes, and road surface, which will require approximately 600,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Guizhou-Yunnan Highway</p>
<p>This highway starts from Guiyang, passes through Anshun and Panxian, reaches Pingyi on the border of Yunnan, and then reaches Kunming. Among them, the Guiyang-Anshun section and the Kunming-Pingyi section have been completed. The Anshun-Pingyi section is yet to be constructed. It is now divided into two sections for construction. The first section is from Anshun to the border of Guizhou, is 100 kilometers long, and requires 1 million yuan. The second section is from Pingyi to the border of Yunnan, is 100 kilometers long, and requires 500,000 yuan. The surveying and earthwork projects of both sections are progressing simultaneously in order to complete them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The above lines are currently under active construction. The rehabilitation projects are contracted by the Shangyuqing Company. In addition to the earthwork construction being done locally, 5,000 skilled workers have been recruited from the Yixian and Baoding areas to take on the stone construction work. 3,000 have been allocated to Guizhou, and 2,000 have been allocated to Sichuan. In the future, after the completion of each route, it will be possible to travel by car from the capital or Shanghai via Zhejiang, Hunan, and Jiangxi directly to Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi. It will take approximately seven days to reach Guizhou, seven days to reach Guangxi, eight days to reach Sichuan, and nine days to reach Yunnan. Chairman Chiang is very concerned about the progress of each line project and has telegraphed the Highway Office of the Provisional Headquarters to complete the construction of each line by the end of this year. Li Yu himself will still go to Guizhou to supervise the construction work of each line after Zeng Yangfu returns to Zhejiang to request funding issues. (24th)</p>
<h3>The Reality of Promoting Legal Tender in Chaozhou and Shantou</h3>
<p>Discrimination Against Legal Tender Is Frequently Seen; Banknotes Are Still Extremely Complicated</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: After the Guangdong Provincial Finance Office announced that the banknotes of the Provincial Bank and the Municipal Bank would be legal tender, the Shantou branch of the Provincial Bank had approximately 1.2 million yuan in silver dollar notes and fractional silver dollar notes in circulation, which had a very good reputation. However, the Finance Office suddenly lowered the price of banknotes in the new six-point measures. Now, ten dimes in silver dollars can be exchanged for twelve dimes in banknotes, and one silver dollar can be exchanged for fourteen dimes and four cents in banknotes. The Finance Office intends to absorb more silver in this way, but it has invisibly discounted the legal tender by 20%, and prices have risen accordingly. Moreover, countless disputes often arise in commercial transactions and repayments. For example, for goods purchased or loans borrowed before the 7th, one party uses legal tender for repayment, while the other party demands an additional 20% surcharge. For example, the slaughterhouse under the jurisdiction of the Shantou Municipal Government once refused to use legal tender, and the slaughterers filed a complaint. The export paper material donation bureau demanded that merchants pay 50% in cash and 50% in legal tender for tax payments, and the merchants also refused to pay according to the requirement, resulting in disputes. Countless similar disputes have occurred continuously. In order to assist the government in promoting legal tender, the Shantou Municipal Party Department convened a meeting of all circles on the afternoon of the 13th at 2 p.m. More than 100 leaders of party, government, military, commercial, and industrial organizations attended the meeting. The meeting was chaired by Li Zicai, who announced the reasons for the meeting, saying that the government had issued a clear order to implement legal tender and that the city had already complied. All sectors should unanimously assist the government in promoting it. Everyone expressed their opinions on the spot and decided on three measures, which were sent to the municipal government for handling: (1) Please have the Shantou branch of the Guangdong Provincial Bank issue more fractional silver dollar auxiliary coins to facilitate market turnover. (2) Order the municipal chamber of commerce to notify all merchants to use legal tender in full and not to discount it. (3) Silver dollar and fractional silver dollar coins and silver shop should not open for business. The above resolutions have been sent to the municipal government, chamber of commerce, and silver shop for inspection and handling.</p>
<p>The Shantou Exchange also convened a meeting of its members and resolved to comply with the legal tender case. However, regarding the second item in the six-point measures announced by the Finance Office, which stated that the legal tender reserve fund should be managed and issued jointly by the government and the people, they requested the municipal government to forward it to the Legislative Yuan and establish a local reserve management committee in Shantou City to show great faith. They also requested the government to order the Shantou Customs, Postal, and Telegraph Bureau to uniformly accept legal tender from this province in order to standardize it. It was also resolved that all stores in the city should comply with the government's mandate and use the provincial bank's silver dollar legal tender and the city's commercial warehouse vouchers as the same currency for transactions. The East District Commissioner's Office issued a notice to the people yesterday on the method of paying official tribute as follows: "When using fractional silver dollar notes for transactions, the original 30% surcharge will still be calculated. Silver coins are calculated with a surcharge of 20%, and an additional 1 yuan surcharge will be added. Silver coins should continue to be used in the same way as commercial warehouse vouchers. Violators will be detained." The so-called implementation of legal tender in Guangdong Province is so complicated that the people feel very troubled when using it, which shows the special nature of the situation.</p>
<h3>Revitalizing Rural Areas in Jiangxi: Establishing a Cooperative Treasury</h3>
<p>The Goal is Not Profit, But to Fully Restore Rural Communities</p>
<p>Jiujiang Dispatch: Regarding the revitalization of rural areas in Jiangxi Province, since the allocation of agricultural revitalization loans, the province has successively carried out emergency rural relief and promoted cooperation. The number of cooperatives has gradually increased, and their business has become increasingly developed. The required funds are quite large, so it is necessary to establish special financial institutions to make adjustments. The provincial government previously followed the order to extract 3% to 5% from the total annual revenue to prepare for the establishment of a provincial cooperative treasury, and ordered preparations to begin immediately. Its role is to adjust funds specifically for cooperatives to promote the revival of rural areas. After receiving the order, the provincial government believed that the establishment of the treasury was urgent, and ordered the Finance Department and the Rural Cooperative Committee to allocate funds separately for preparations. Its business scope, according to regulations, includes credit lending, bill discounting, deposit overdrafts, agricultural product storage and lending, remittance services, and acting as an agent for receipts and payments. It is a non-profit legal entity for deposits, handling savings, limited to dealing with cooperatives, and cannot engage in general market transactions. The goal is not to make profits. The capital is tentatively set at two million yuan, with the provincial government subscribing for half the shares, paying ten million yuan first to start business. The remaining money will be paid off in installments within five years. In addition, half of the share amount will be borne by the cooperatives and their federations, to be fully paid up within ten years. The capital subscribed by the provincial government will be used for various agricultural revitalization funds allocated by the central government for bandit disasters, drought disasters, and flood disasters, as well as various agricultural loan funds allocated by the provincial government for the rural cooperative association, and the special allocation of 3% to 5% of the total provincial revenue, the remaining funds from cooperative administrative expenses, to be investigated and allocated by the provincial government.

<p>Chuan Aba, a resident of Liuzhao Town in the Third District, has been idle in Shanghai. Recently, he was used by someone to return to his hometown and bought silver dollars for one yuan and one jiao of legal currency near Liuzhao. On the afternoon of the 22nd, he was discovered by the Liuzhao Town Chamber of Commerce and the Third Public Security Police Station. He was arrested at the Lunbu Wharf, and 183 silver dollars and 675 double silver coins were found on him. The suspect and the evidence were escorted to the county government for verification.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Wu Zhihui and Li Shizeng Visit Wuxi</p>
<p>Wu Zhihui, a supervisory committee member of the National Government, presided over the memorial service for the late fellow villager Yang Zishen. He traveled to Wuxi by train from Nanjing the day before yesterday, accompanied by committee member Li Shizeng and Li's secretary.

<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Arresting Gamblers, Assaulting Police, and Capturing Criminals</p>
<p>According to a tip-off, the first police station outside the West Gate of Wuyi County learned that there was a gathering for gambling at the Heqiao site. The police were dispatched to arrest many gamblers and gambling tools. While they were being escorted, many people suddenly beat drums and gathered a crowd of more than a thousand people, who completely snatched away the gamblers and severely injured three policemen, including Zhu Jusheng. The remaining policemen were also beaten and returned to the station in a panic. They immediately reported to the County Public Security Bureau, which dispatched inspector Xu Shengtin on the 23rd, leading the original policemen to arrest the ringleader Jiang Zihua and Chen Shaoze and six others who carried out the assault. After a preliminary interrogation at the bureau, they were sent to the procuratorate of the local court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Conflict Arises Between Security Team and Police While Watching a Play</p>
<p>A sudden conflict arose between the security team and the police from the Public Security Bureau over the issue of watching a play. A policeman named Tong Hongxian was beaten and injured. The bureau and the team are currently requesting instructions to negotiate. At the Nanyuan Theater outside the South Gate on the 23rd, a policeman named Tong Hongguang intended to enter to watch a play, but was stopped by the security team members present at the scene. A conflict arose, and Tong was beaten. The police were outnumbered, and the audience fled first. After Tong was injured, he was escorted to the team headquarters. At that time, patrol officer Du Wenyin of the jurisdiction police station telegraphed the general bureau for instructions. The director, Zhou Ding, was indignant that his subordinate was insulted and sent personnel to negotiate. The team headquarters agreed to release the police officer. The director believed that the security team and the Public Security Bureau were both subordinate to the county government, and the security team had no direct authority to arrest or beat people other than bandits. If the police had committed any illegal acts, they should report to their superiors and deal with them according to the law. Therefore, he expressed his unwillingness to take the police officer back. The next day, both parties reported to the county magistrate for instructions. However, the police and security team members all expressed indignation. If the matter is not resolved soon, there is a possibility of another conflict.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Liu Degong Assassinated in the Middle of the Night</p>
<p>Liu Degong, the head of the sixth household in the ninth Jia of the eighth Bao in Nanmen Town, outside the South Gate of Yangzhou City, was 67 years old and made a living selling straw sandals. His wife, Cui, and his two sons, Hongcai, were all living in Zhenjiang and working on boats. Only Degong was left at home. He sold straw sandals every day, saved frugally, and accumulated some savings. Unexpectedly, on the night of the 22nd, when it was late and quiet, Degong was suddenly assassinated by thugs and died. On the morning of the 23rd, it was discovered and people went to see. The deceased's head was covered in blood, a tragic sight. It is said that the injury was caused by an axe, but the murderer had escaped and could not be apprehended. The Baojia head has reported to the authorities to request an investigation, and neighbors have sent letters to the deceased's wife and children to rush back to Yangzhou to handle the funeral.</p>
<p>Lu and Han Responded Urgently to Block the Yellow River Breach</p>
<p>Chairman Han of the Shandong Provincial Government, in order to provide assistance to the Joint Association of Shareholders of the Seven Companies in Jinan, telegraphed in response to the case of blocking the Yellow River breach within a specified time, stating that after the Yellow River breach, the provincial government immediately established a blocking project committee to actively carry out the blocking project, raising funds and transporting materials. Construction started following the predetermined plan. If there are no unexpected changes, the ground will thaw and materials will be ready, and it can be occupied and closed after the new year. In addition to supervising the work, a reply has been sent for reference. The Suzhou Provincial Government also urged the Shandong Province to complete the Yellow River damming project by a certain date.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>The Special Commissioner's Office Stops the Labor Strikes in Tong and Chongming</p>
<p>The Nantong District Administrative Inspector's Office, in response to the sudden strikes by textile workers at the Datong Sub-factory of Dasheng in Nantong, and workers at the Datong Yarn Factory in Chongming, ordered the magistrates of the two counties of Tong and Chongming to quickly mediate and limit both labor and management to resume work unconditionally. If there are any inappropriate aspects on the part of the factory, they should be studied and improved after work resumes.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Jin District Sugar Factory Expands Equipment</p>
<p>The Jin District Cooperative Sugar Factory, after the Construction Department allocated funds to add new-style machinery and equipment for expansion, has completed the installation and resumed normal operation. Sugar production has suddenly increased. Every hundred dan (a Chinese unit of dry weight) of 20 tickets can originally produce 5 dan of sugar, but now it has increased to 10 dan. The factory now produces 50 dan of sugar per day, worth more than 200 yuan, and the quality has improved, and sales have increased sharply. The Yiwu and other county sugar cooperative societies are responsible for supplying raw materials, which are quite sufficient. Cao Mingxian, a technical officer sent by the Construction Department to inspect the results, believed that it was very promising. The department contacted the Bank of China to borrow 30,000 yuan as working capital. The Bank of China has now requested instructions from the Shanghai head office.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Continued Reports on the Escape of Thieves</p>

Dong Yiming, the guard on duty that night, was also sent to the court for punishment on the 23rd for ineffective protection.</p>
<h3>Security Situation in the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zang</p>
<p>Since 1932, Japan has invested 900 million yuan in Manchuria. However, apart from some profits in the mining industry, Manchuria's production has made no progress. Agriculture, which accounts for the majority of production, has fallen into a state of deep panic. The improvement of farming and the cultivation of new agricultural products are still in the experimental stage. It will take a considerable amount of time to achieve results. Moreover, the burden on farmers has increased year by year for the past four years. According to a survey by Japanese Yamazaki Yasusumi, in the case of Jiamusi alone, transporting wheat from the Songhua River to Harbin, a distance of only 320 kilometers, required nine kinds of exorbitant taxes four years ago. Although it has been reduced to seven kinds now, the actual burden is heavier than nine kinds. The farmers' monetary income has also decreased sharply in recent years, and the relative burden has increased greatly, resulting in increasing poverty. Everyone is heartbroken about the current situation. However, under the control of force, there is nothing they can do.</p>
<p>This year, the pseudo-organization authorities are striving to increase production in terms of production. Japanese people have been hired to plan improvements in rice in the east, sheep in the west, cotton in the south, fruit trees, tobacco, peanuts, sesame, and wheat and flax in the north. However, the development of agriculture in Manchuria cannot be effective quickly. Most agricultural products, except for the large-scale production of soybeans, are not easy to propagate due to climate relations. Farmers have repeatedly failed to plant new varieties. If production is increased, it will conflict with the interests of Japanese capitalism. In addition, the anti-Japanese armies in Manchuria are constantly rising and falling, and agricultural products are greatly affected and damaged by the military. Under such circumstances, farmers have to take risks, either joining the anti-Japanese army or turning into Reds, entrenched everywhere. For example, in the "Jiandao Second District" (near Yanji County, Jilin Province, a mountainous area of twenty or thirty square miles), there has been a "Soviet" construction north of Yilangou. It has been going on for four years, and the Japanese army has devoted all its efforts to suppress it, but it is still difficult to pacify it. In August of this year, the Kwantung Army announced the number of "bandits" in Manchuria as follows:</p>
<p>"Soldier bandits" 8,000 people</p>
<p>"Communist bandits" 7,000 people</p>
<p>"XX bandits" 500 people</p>
<p>"Local bandits" 12,500 people</p>
<p>Total 28,000 people</p>
<p>The above number, if combined with farmers who communicate with the anti-Japanese army, is actually no less than 200,000 people. Just take the so-called "Communist bandits" as an example. The so-called "Communist bandits" are known as the "Anti-Japanese Volunteer United Army in Manchuria." It is divided into twelve armies. The Sixth Army is scattered in northern Manchuria, while the others are distributed in the triangular area from Jilin Andong to Dalian. According to the Japanese survey, the garrisons of the armies are as follows:</p>
<p>First Army... Along the Manchurian Railway line bordering northern Manchuria. (Leader unknown)</p>
<p>Second Army... In the Jiandao area, in contact with the Korean Communists. Commanded by Zhu Zhen.</p>
<p>Third Army... In the Zhuhe Panshi area. Commanded by Zhao Shangzhi.</p>
<p>Fourth Army... In the Mishan Hulin area. Commanded by Li Yanlu.</p>
<p>Fifth Army... In the Ning'an Muling Dongning area. Commanded by Zhou Baozhong.</p>
<p>Sixth Army... In the Tangyuan Zichuan area. (Leader unknown)</p>
<p>These Communist troops mostly build barracks in dense forests and cultivate agriculture in mountain clearings. They are quite organized. The combat method they adopt is purely guerrilla warfare. They appear and disappear mysteriously. Even the elite Japanese army often falls into their trap. Over the years, the Japanese army has carried out more than 100 attacks in the Yilangou and Baicaogou areas, but it has been difficult to succeed. For example, in April 1933, the Japanese army launched a large-scale invasion of the "Soviet" of Jiandao, but was defeated by the Communist troops, sacrificing two-thirds of its forces. The Communist troops have barracks and arsenals in the area, manufacturing guns and ammunition, relying on natural dangers, and resisting for a long time. In Heshuiping, north of Yilan, a "Soviet Area" boundary marker has been erected. Japanese people who want to pass through its boundary must be strictly inspected. Therefore, the Japanese army has not been able to cross the Leichi Lake since 1932. It is said that the Yilangou police team has dispatched more than 80 times to fight, fighting more than 130 times. Fourteen police officers were killed, and forty-four Japanese army officers were killed. The reason why the Communist troops can last for a long time is that the farmers and the Communist troops have become one. The farmers' common organization in terms of economy can prevent financial stagnation. The guidance and training for agricultural improvement are also very skilled. Villages everywhere communicate with each other and jointly defend themselves during wartime, so it is difficult for the Japanese army to attack.</p>
<p>It is said that the organization of the Communist troops in the area is completely the same as that of the regular army. It adopts a three-three system, with divisions of army, division, brigade, regiment, battalion, company, and platoon. The cadres are all educated to a considerable extent. Schools are also attached to the barracks in the dense forests, using the "Korean National Textbook." All daily necessities are complete. As for their propaganda texts, they are in Japanese, Manchurian, Korean, and Chinese. Japanese is mostly used for propaganda to the Japanese army, depicting the poor state of the Tohoku region of Japan, and advising Japanese soldiers to join forces and cooperate. There are many postings on the walls, trees, and roadside telephone poles in the border area. Even Japanese army barracks often find such leaflets. Most surprisingly, there are spies everywhere. The universality of their intelligence network and contact network is beyond imagination. They usually use peddlers and beggars to scout external information and purchase food. Therefore, before the Japanese army sets out, the news has already been transmitted to the Communist army headquarters. A few years ago, the Communist troops set up bonfires on the hills to convey signals. Now each team has a flashlight, using night attacks, which makes it difficult for the Japanese army to sleep peacefully. Last year, the Kwantung Army and the Korean Governor-General's Office agreed on a method, stipulating the Jiandao Group Tribal Defense Law, which is to recruit the families of those who were killed by the "Communist bandits" in the tribes and form armed self-defense teams. At the same time, they are given arable land to make them self-sufficient. However, because the defense force is weak, it is attacked by the Communist troops. In addition, it is difficult for the tribal people to maintain self-sufficiency through reclamation. They often flee with weapons and join the Communist army, so the strength of the Communist army in Jiandao is even more formidable.</p>

<h3>Sugar Industry Association Welcomed Lin Yunhai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Lin Encouraged the Sugar Merchants to Work Hard to Promote Sales</p>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar Industry Association dispatched Deng Zenan, Zheng Yizhou, and the Sugar Industry Cooperative dispatched Chen Tingfang, Xinghua Company dispatched Shi, and went to the New Asia Hotel at about 11:00 AM yesterday to welcome Lin Yunhai, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, and held a welcome meeting at Dianchun Hall. In addition to Chairman Lin, Feng Rui, Director of the Guangdong Agriculture and Forestry Bureau, Chen Yuanying, Director of the Guangdong Products Management Office, Liang Zhihuai, Secretary-General of the Guangdong Provincial Government, Liu Jiwen, Mayor of Guangzhou, Tang Haian, Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, Liang Hejun, Chairman of the Food Transportation and Sales Management Committee, Cai Jinjun, Director of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, and Liu Hongsheng, General Manager of the China Merchants Bureau, all attended. More than 140 representatives of the Sugar Industry Association attended. Liu Yun, Chief of the Yimiao Police Station, led armed police to maintain order.</p>
<p>Welcome Speech</p>
<p>The presidium consisted of Zheng Zenan, Zheng Yizhou, Zhu Gengxin and three others. The master of ceremonies was Xu Shujun, the record keeper was Jin Meiting. After the ceremony, Zheng Zenan first delivered a welcome speech, saying, "Today, we are holding a welcome meeting for Lin, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government. We are honored to have Chairman Lin and Mayor Liu, Director Feng, Director Chen, and all of you to grace us with your presence. The reason why our association welcomes Chairman Lin today is that Chairman Lin is not only a veteran of the party and the country, but also his achievements in governing Guangdong are outstanding throughout the country, worthy of being called a wise and exemplary official. He also pays attention to people's livelihood in production and construction, and is very hardworking, especially in using the favorable conditions of Guangdong Province to promote sugarcane planting, establish sugar factories, and actively revive the national sugar industry. In January this year, the three factories started production and transported more than 300,000 dan to Shanghai for sale. The quality of the products is comparable to that of foreign sugar. Recently, we learned that three new factories have been set up and will be put into operation soon. With such rapid progress and excellent results, domestic sugar can be supplied to the whole country in about three years in the near future and five years in the distant future, without the need to rely on foreign sugar. Our industry is deeply aware that foreign sugar is still trying to dump its goods, and it will not be possible to succeed without unity. Therefore, we have organized a sugar cooperative company to work hard to promote sales. For a year, we have always been loyal and sold as much as possible, even if it is only one more cent, and sold as many packages as possible. However, there may be delays due to the situation and the price of gold from time to time. We ask for your forgiveness. This is the situation of production and sales for the past year. From now on, Shanghai sugar merchants can sell domestic sugar instead of selling foreign sugar, so that they will no longer be tools for foreign economic aggression. This is all thanks to Chairman Lin, so our industry held a meeting to welcome Chairman Lin, based on this meaning."</p>
<p>Lin's Reply</p>
<p>Chairman Lin then delivered a reply, saying, "In recent years, China's agriculture, industry, and commerce have been extremely depressed. To benefit the national economy and people's livelihood, it is necessary to establish factories. The raw materials produced by farmers can be supplied to factories to obtain profits, and workers can also have jobs to do. Merchants have goods to sell, and the number of unemployed people in agriculture, industry, and commerce can be reduced, and they can all benefit from it, so as to cultivate the vitality of the country. Although the achievements of our Guangdong sugar factory are barely satisfactory, it is difficult to achieve significant results without promotion and sales cooperation. Now Shanghai merchants are able to uphold their patriotic aspirations and promote domestic sugar, which is very admirable. I hope that you will continue to work hard to promote sales in the future to help the development of Guangdong's revival of domestic sugar." After Chairman Lin finished speaking, Mayor Liu, Superintendent Tang, Director Feng, Director Chen, Chairman Liang, and others gave speeches one after another, mostly encouraging sugar merchants to work hard to promote domestic sugar. Finally, Zheng Zenan delivered a thank-you speech, and after taking pictures at about 1:00 PM, a public banquet continued until about 3:00 PM before it ended.</p>
<h3>Belgian Minister Gyselynck Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Jiangxi Province Promotes Acceptance Bills: Bank of China Agrees to Lend One Million</h3>
<p>Director Wu Came to Shanghai to Negotiate Loans, Guaranteed by the Local Banking Industry in Jiangxi</p>
<p>According to the Industry Association, the financial sector in Jiangxi Province believes that the province's economy is depleted and the industry and commerce need funds urgently. The loans from various banks have been lacking. Therefore, Wu, the Director of the Department of Finance, was invited to Shanghai to explain the situation of the industrial and commercial depression in the province to Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Finance, and borrow 6 million yuan from the Central Bank as a fund to promote acceptance bills. Wu arrived in Shanghai and is currently negotiating the loan procedures with the Bank of China. According to an investigation by the Industry Association reporter yesterday, the Bank of China has agreed to lend 1 million yuan for this loan because it is for the relief of industry and commerce. However, the entire financial sector must be responsible for the guarantee. Wu received a reply from the province yesterday that 37 member banks of the Banking Association are jointly and severally responsible, and the Department of Finance and the Central, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Yumin Banks each recommend one person, and the six people from the Clearing House jointly form an examination committee to be responsible for the lending. After receiving the telegram, Wu has conveyed it to the Central Bank. After further negotiations, the loan contract can be signed.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government and Shanghai Commercial Inspection Bureau Research Rice and Wheat Grading</h3>
<p>Already Drafted Implementation Plan and Steps</p>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, in order to prevent merchants from adulterating food grains, improve the quality of various food grains, and adapt agricultural warehouses for storage, transportation, and sales to the needs of factories, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has specifically collaborated with the Shanghai Commercial Inspection Bureau to establish a Rice and Wheat Grading Research Office in Shanghai. Experts have been hired, with Mo Dingsen as the director. The various plans are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Outline of Rice and Wheat Grading</p>
<p>(1) Grain crops include rice, wheat, barley, corn, sorghum, etc. Legume crops include soybeans, mung beans, peas, etc. The production of grade standards will begin with rice and wheat. (2) Standard collection will focus on collecting specimens of various grains and legumes in Jiangsu Province, especially on rice and wheat specimens in the first two years. (3) Study the grain characteristics of wheat, rice, etc., such as the integrity, plumpness, color, size, weight, dryness, degree of hardness, viscosity, etc. (4) Formulate trial grade standards, collect various food grain specimens, study their grain characteristics, and identify their grades. However, there are also categories within each species, such as red and white wheat bran color, hard and soft hardness, and spring and autumn barley, as well as the differences between japonica rice, indica rice, and glutinous rice. It seems appropriate to divide them into groups according to their categories, and each group can be divided into five grades, then formulate trial grade standards for various types. (5) The above plan is divided into five years to complete. It is estimated that trial grade standards for rice can be formulated in the third year, trial grade standards for wheat in the fourth year, and trial grade standards for soybeans and mung beans in the fifth year. The deadline can also be slightly shortened, but at least a three-year budget for continued research is required.</p>
<p>Implementation Plan and Steps</p>
<p>Based on the predetermined outline, the implementation plan is formulated as follows: 2. Implementation steps will be carried out in the following order: (1) Wheat; (2) Rice, Soybeans; (3) (4) Barley, Mung Beans, etc. 2. Investigation methods: The most important thing for grading grains and legumes is rationalization and suitability to market conditions. The former can be graded and identified, while the latter must be investigated. The investigation can be divided into (1) items: (1) Investigate the varieties, sales volume, output, and price changes of various grains and legumes sold in Jiangsu to serve as a reference for grading. (2) Investigate the agencies, associations, or factories in Jiangsu that manage grains and legumes to establish contact and achieve cooperation and mutual assistance. (3) Establish a grading room. Grading and identification require considerable equipment, so it is appropriate to establish a grading room and purchase necessary instruments and supplies for grading and identification. The following is a list of important instruments and standards: 1. Moisture tester; 2. Standard bushel; 3. Standard sieve; 4. Microscope; 5. Grain and legume grade standards; 6. Grain and legume standards; 7. Winnowing box; 8. Market scale; 9. Magnifying glass; 10. Tweezers; 11. Precision balance; 12. Ordinary balance; 13. Micrometer; 14. Grain transverse cutter; 15. Grain balance; 16. Others, collect samples, formulate forms, and send personnel to collect samples of various grains and legumes in Jiangsu. In the first year, the focus will be on collecting samples of wheat and rice. (5) Grading and identification: Grading and identification involves a detailed study of moisture, impurities, color, bulk density, shape, etc., and evaluating the grade. (6) Reproduce standards: There are many varieties of grains and legumes. If there are no fixed standards for grading and identification, there will be many difficulties in progress. It is planned to make specimens of the grains and legumes that have been graded and identified, with explanations, for comparison during grading. (7) Formulate trial grade standards: Based on the results of the above investigation, grading, and research, the trial grade standard for wheat will be formulated in the first year, the trial grade standard for rice will be formulated in the second year, and the trial grade standards for soybeans, barley, etc., will be started in the third year.</p>

<p>More than 6,000 Boy Scouts in the city pleaded for the victims of the disaster in various provinces and participated in a general donation mobilization starting on the 9th. A total of nine days, divided into external and internal, were completed on the 17th. The amount of income has exceeded the previous donation achievements of the city's Boy Scouts. The Boy Scouts who work hard for the public are admired, and the enthusiastic support of the society is also touching.

Among the donations paid, the 1,500 yuan from Minli Girls' High School is the largest. According to the head of the school's delegation, the donations collected by the school's Boy Scouts this time are about 2,000 yuan. Once the settlement is clear, it will be handed over to the council. The reporter predicts that the school's donation achievements will jump to the first place, and Kunshan Middle School will rank second or third. In addition, there are still donations that have not been paid, including Guangzhao Middle School, Wanzhu Primary School, and Dagong Middle School.

It is reported that the Boy Scouts Council has decided to formally announce on the 27th. All groups or individuals with excellent achievements will be awarded separately in accordance with the previous agreement to encourage them. The awards have been contracted by the Standard Company and will be completed soon.</p>
<h3>Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau Simplifies Insurance Methods</h3>
<p>Divided into Lifetime and Term, Minimum 50 Yuan. Insurance Premiums are Calculated at a Weekly Interest Rate of 3.5%</p>

(8) If the policyholder does not apply, the insured person should be invited to meet at the bureau. (9) According to the provisions of the preceding article, if the insured person is in another location, making it impossible for the insurance bureau to meet with them, the insured person may meet with the insurance bureau in the place where they are located.</p>
<p>Group Contract</p>
<p>(10) Employees of various agencies, companies, banks, factories, schools, and other groups, who gather fifteen or more people and simultaneously sign insurance contracts, may handle them in accordance with group contracts.

However, the method and location of paying the insurance premium, which should be filled in in each insurance application form, may be omitted. The group contract application form should truthfully fill in the following items and be signed and sealed by the representative: (A) Group name and address; (B) Representative name and address; (C) Number of insurance application forms;</p>
<h3>This Museum Received Flood Relief Donations Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 24th), this museum received flood relief donations, including students in the second and third grades of the Minzhong Primary School, saving their daily snack money and donating a total of three yuan and thirty cents in silver dollars, the Renhe Girls' Primary School donated a total of six yuan and sixty cents in silver dollars, thirty-four cents in small silver coins, and Ms. Deng Fengqi two yuan, for a total of eleven yuan and ninety cents in silver dollars and thirty-four cents in small silver coins.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Again Sends Letter Requesting the Promotion of Acceptance Drafts</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, upon receiving a letter from Supervisory Committee member Luo Qinghua urging the promotion of acceptance drafts, specifically sent letters to the Central Bank, the Industrial and Commercial Loan Committee, and the Silver and Money Guild yesterday, stating that the promotion of commercial acceptance drafts is the only good strategy to improve lending, which is beneficial to the turnover of industrial and commercial funds. However, the implementation of this method depends entirely on the acceptance and discounting by the money industry and the rediscounting by the Central Bank, so that the bills can be active in the market. Previously, in March of this year, your bank (Central Bank) replied, agreeing to handle rediscounting business to facilitate turnover, and the banking industry association has also submitted a reply with the proposed discounting methods. However, there is still no concrete method that can be used as a basis for implementation. The silk and satin industry, the electrical machinery silk weaving factory industry, and the machinery dyeing and weaving industry in this city have already started to handle commercial acceptance drafts, and other industries are also proceeding as appropriate. Under these circumstances, it is essential for the financial industry to provide practical assistance and implement the discounting and rediscounting methods as soon as possible in order to achieve effective results. The proposals in the original letter are in line with the current trend and are an urgent plan. In addition to sending separate letters, we hereby request that your bank quickly implement the regulations on rediscounting for silver and money businesses (your association should accept and handle the discounting of acceptance drafts requested by various industries, and give priority to handling acceptance or discounting for the identified small-amount loan fund) to benefit industry and commerce, etc.</p>
<h3>Chrysanthemum Competition First Remittance of 600 Yuan for Relief</h3>
<p>The entire staff of the rooftop garden of the Xin Xin Company in this port held a chrysanthemum competition for disaster relief on the 23rd and 4th of this month. Li Dachao, deputy director of the fundraising group of the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Disaster Relief in Various Provinces, obtained tickets and sent them to leaders from all walks of life in the city to promote sales. It has been more than ten days, and it is not yet fully concluded. However, it is reported that the Disaster Relief Association received 600 yuan from Deputy Director Li yesterday as a first remittance for disaster relief, which will be distributed to disaster areas.</p>
<h3>Money Houses Submit Hard Currency, Finance Department Approves Return of Redemption Certificates, 40% Government Bonds and 60% Cash for Legal Tender, and Instructs the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications to Comply</h3>
<p>Shiye News Agency reports that the 1.65 million yuan in hard currency of the member banks of the Money Industry Association has been fully submitted to the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications for exchange into legal tender. The Ministry of Finance has now approved the return of the cash exchanged before the 4th of this month, and the exchange into legal tender will still be done at 40% government bonds and 60% cash to protect preferential rights. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Cash Reserve Fully Exchanged for Legal Tender</p>
<p>Each member bank of the industry has a cash reserve of 30,000 yuan in silver dollars for remittance business, which is deposited with the Money Industry Joint Reserve. In case of insufficient funds to pay for the issued bills, a portion of the fund will be withdrawn to make up for it to maintain credit. A total of 1.65 million yuan in cash reserves is held by 55 member banks. Since the Ministry of Finance promulgated the new monetary policy and Minister Kong personally explained the meaning of currency to industry leaders, the hard currency cash reserves of the money industry were gradually sealed up. The money house representatives exchanged all the silver dollars for legal tender at the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications to comply with the law and facilitate use.</p>
<p>Finance Department Approves Return of Redemption Certificates</p>
<p>At the beginning of the implementation of the new monetary policy by the Ministry of Finance, there were provisions for preferential rights. Those who hold hard currency can apply to designated banks to exchange for legal tender at 40% government bonds and 60% cash. However, the money industry, in compliance with the Ministry's order, exchanged all the hard currency of the money house cash reserve for legal tender around the 4th. The money industry believes that the preferential rights for all the hard currency exchanged for legal tender at the three banks before the 4th appear to have been lost. Therefore, it specially requested the Ministry of Finance to approve the return of the hard currency exchanged before the 4th and exchange it for legal tender in accordance with the regulations of 40% government bonds and 60% cash to protect rights and interests. Recently, according to the reporter's inquiries with the Money Industry Association, the request has been formally approved by the Ministry of Finance, and in addition to approving the requested exchange into legal tender in accordance with the regulations, it has also instructed the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications to investigate and handle the return exchange of hard currency before the 4th of this month. After receiving the order, the industry association immediately submitted it to the previous standing committee meeting for discussion and decision, and it was recorded separately yesterday and notified to each member bank to handle accordingly.</p>

<h3>Various Organizations Held a Joint Meeting Yesterday, Decided to Form a Telephone Problem Research Association, Appointed Committee Members to Draft an Organizational Outline</h3>
<p>Various organizations in the city, in opposition to the telephone call-based billing, convened a joint meeting at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 pm yesterday. Those who attended included Chinese directors of the Public Works Department Yu Qiaqing, Jiang Yiping, Guo Shun, Chen Zheqing, Yuan Ludeng, Yan Esheng of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession, Li Weiliang of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession, Zhang Yichen of the United Association of Citizens of the First Special District, Mao Yun of the United Association of Citizens of the Second Special District, and representatives from the National Goods Promotion Association, the China National Products Manufacturers Association, the Citizens' National Goods Consumption Association, the Leather Goods, Letterpress Printing, Pawnbroking, Local Goods, Biscuit, Candy, Shipping, Lumber, Transshipment Customs Declaration, Bicycle Manufacturing and Selling, Bamboo Industry, Washing and Dyeing, and Iron Printing and Can Making Associations, as well as representatives from the Pudong, Taixian, Zhuji, Xianju, Chaozhou, Nantong, and Guangdong Native Place Associations Chen Jiufeng, Zheng Jianbo, Xiang Kangyuan, Liu Zhongying, and more than 100 others.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Zhang Yichen, Yan Esheng, Mao Yun, Gu Wensheng, Qu Qiufang, and five others were elected as the presidium. First, Zhang Yichen reported, "Since the Shanghai Telephone Company implemented call-based billing, various circles have successively risen in opposition. As a result, the Public Works Department hired telephone experts from China, Britain, the United States, and Japan to study the issue, but they still favored one side. In their report, they actually recognized the company's demand for an annual interest rate of 1%, and suggested call-based billing as a disguised price increase. They completely ignored the company's wasteful expenses, the error in the interest rate, and the users' ability to pay. Various circles have expressed indignation about this. I believe that telephones are public utilities and communication tools, and should strive for universality, with low fees and multiple installations as the principle. Even if the company is concerned with business, it should also profit from quantity. Otherwise, if telephone charges increase and users decrease, the company will inevitably fail. In the experts' report, the regulations for call-based billing are 10 yuan per month for stores, allowing 150 calls, and 6.5 yuan per month for households, allowing 100 calls. If the above numbers are exceeded, a fee of 3 cents is charged for each call. From the surface, the monthly rent seems slightly lower than before, but the burden on users is actually greatly increased due to the strict limitation of the number of calls and the expensive fees for exceeding the number. Therefore, if the experts' opinions are rashly implemented, users will be forced to remove their telephones due to the heavy telephone charges. Not only will the company's desire for an annual interest rate of 1% ultimately be unattainable, but it will also fall into a more difficult situation. I dare to say that this association has also conducted thorough discussions and believes that even if the call-based billing method is to be implemented, it should be corrected. The plan is (1) to reduce the monthly rent to 6 yuan for stores and 3 yuan for households, (2) to increase the number of calls per month to 300 for stores and 200 for residences, (3) to charge 2 cents for each call exceeding the number, and (4) to abolish the call fee between the urban area and the special district. Only in this way can fairness be seen, and there will be fewer obstacles in the implementation of the call-based method. However, as a result, the Public Works Department has passed the price increase to an annual interest rate of 1%. For this reason, a joint meeting was convened to discuss the matter." Jiang Yiping then reported on the situation of the board of directors' passage.</p>
<p>Resolutions</p>
<p>The proposals were then discussed: (1) Oppose the Public Works Department's board of directors' approval of the call-based telephone billing plan. Resolution: Form a committee to handle the matter. A. The committee is named the Shanghai Special District Telephone Problem Research Committee. B. The number of members will be one representative from each organization. The presidium will convene a meeting of representatives to appoint committee members. C. Appoint Zhang Yichen, Yan Esheng, Gu Wensheng, Qu Qiufang, Mao Yun, Li Biekui, Wang Jian'e, and seven others to draft an organizational outline. D. Send a letter to the Public Works Department asking how much telephone equipment is planned for the concession and how many sets are currently installed. Please give a clear answer. (2) Oppose the Public Works Department's special committee and patrolmen's abuse of rickshaw pullers. Resolution: Send a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association and the Public Works Department to negotiate. (3) Promote industrial and commercial prosperity and require landlords to automatically reduce rents. Resolution: The presidium will jointly submit a request to the municipal government to persuade landlords to voluntarily reduce rents by 40%. (4) Intensify production and require silver and money businesses to reduce loan interest rates. Resolution: Submit a request to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to order the implementation. (5) Stop the opportunistic price increase of raw materials. Resolution: A. Submit a request to the municipal government to stop the price increase. B. Send a letter to each trade association ordering members to supervise each other. (6) Ban unscrupulous merchants from privately collecting silver coins and silver corners. Resolution: Advise citizens not to seek small profits and harm the national interest.</p>
<h3>Old Lumber Industry Association Requests Government Relief for the Market</h3>
<p>The Old Lumber Industry Association held its second general membership meeting at the association's meeting place on Zhejiang Road the other day. Zhu Yakui, representative of the Municipal Party Department, Yuan Hongjun, representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and member representatives Fang Fayu, Luo Baokang, Wang Funan, Lou Gengcai, Zhang Mingcai, He Maoguan, Yu Shuping, and more than 100 others attended. Chen Chunyang, Ling Yongde, Chen Xianshen, Fan Genchu, and Liu Suilin were elected as the presidium. After the ceremony, Ling Yongde gave the opening speech and passed several industry rules and proposals, the most important of which was the request for government relief for commerce and a stable passage through the end of the year. The original text is as follows: "Since the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, the wounds have not yet healed. Like being hit by the universal economic downturn in the world, attacked by the countercurrents, and threatened by international economic aggression, the financial undertakings of our country have had to adopt a tight policy to seek self-preservation. The general business community is the first to bear the brunt, and a naked anxiety is presented. To put it bluntly, if the general business community does not have the determination to strive for revitalization, I am afraid that the period of total collapse is not far away. We are in business to talk about business. May I ask, when general businessmen look around at the lifeless status quo, who would be willing to work with peace of mind and do it boldly? To seek their own self-preservation strength, they have to reduce salaries and lay off employees, entering a state of invisible stagnation. Affected by this, factories and shops are in danger of closing nine out of ten doors, and the society is increasing the number of unemployed people. Thinking deeply about this, how can we not feel heartbroken? Can this kind of status quo last for a long time? Under the current difficult situation, apart from requesting the government to quickly plan relief measures to stabilize commerce, and on the one hand, we should awaken ourselves and strive to support the remnant situation and reorganize the lineup, what other method is there to improve the aftermath? Now the period for the total conclusion of the Republic of China in 24 years is approaching in an instant. To overcome the difficulties, we can only request the government and financial institutions and representatives of various industries to discuss relief measures. In the careful planning and consideration of both parties, we should first accommodate the outstanding loans at the end of the year. In fact, there are those who have not been able to clear them immediately, and it is necessary to postpone them. Or, we should refer to the government's method of maintaining the silver and money industry at the end of June of the Republic of China in 24 years and the accommodation of long-term loans at the end of October of the same year to make changes. And please order the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications and the silver and money industry to treat the merchant's inventory and real estate equally, regardless of whether it belongs to the concession or the Chinese realm, whether it belongs to the business license or the rented land to build houses, and increase the valuation to give as much mortgage as possible, or as collateral for loans. On the one hand, the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications should re-mortgage, and then discuss the method of restoring credit loans for the coming year, or request the government to issue relief public bonds to each industry to maintain the dying commerce and achieve the road to revival. Otherwise, the market will show signs of collapse, and merchants are in danger of declaring bankruptcy. Even if they勉支残局, it is difficult to sell factory products, and shops have no hope of liquidity. Wandering on a fork in the road, how can we imagine it? It should be resolved to submit it to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward it to the government for relief."</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Flood Relief Association Received Three Donations</h3>
<p>More than 11,000 Yuan from the Commercial Press, 2,000 Yuan in Silver Dollars from the Chaozhou Guild for Disaster Relief, and 5,000 Yuan from Mr. Lin Kanghou's Birthday Celebration for Disaster Relief</p>
<p>The Shanghai Flood Relief Association for Various Provinces, located on Yunnan Road in this city, received three donation letters yesterday from the Commercial Press and others. The donation amounts were quite substantial, demonstrating admirable generosity towards the disaster victims. The details of each letter are recorded below:</p>
<p>Letter from the Staff of the Commercial Press Headquarters and Branches: "Dear Sirs, the floods in various provinces this year have been disastrous. Our company and all the staff of our headquarters, branches, and factories have donated to assist in the relief efforts.

We respectfully request that you verify receipt, issue a receipt, and forward it to the disaster areas for distribution. Your public-spiritedness is greatly appreciated. The total donation amount sent in two installments is 11,831 yuan and 8 jiao and 3 fen, of which 5,000 yuan was donated by our company, 4,850 yuan and 2 jiao and 7 fen by the staff of our headquarters, and 1,981 yuan and 5 jiao and 6 fen by the staff of the branches and factories. This is stated together for your reference. We wish you well."</p>
<p>Letter from the Guangdong Association in Shanghai: "Dear Sirs, we are sending 2,000 yuan in silver dollars donated by the Chaozhou Guild for disaster relief. We would appreciate it if you could verify receipt, issue a receipt, and publish a notice of thanks in the newspaper. To the Shanghai Flood Relief Association for Various Provinces."</p>
<p>Letter from Mr. Lin Kanghou, a Prominent Figure in This City: "Dear Sirs, recently, on the occasion of my humble birthday, I was honored to receive generous donations from relatives and friends, totaling over 5,000 yuan. In addition to the 1,200 yuan directly received by your association as birthday gifts, I am now sending 4,000 yuan. Although I should have prepared a small banquet for my relatives and friends to express my gratitude, I believe that such extravagance is useless. Therefore, I am donating the 1,000 yuan intended for the banquet as well, making a total of 5,000 yuan. I hope you will verify receipt and distribute it to the disaster areas, thereby creating blessings for my relatives and friends. I have enclosed a letter of thanks, which I respectfully request that your association publish in various newspapers. This is my earnest request. To the Shanghai Flood Relief Association for Various Provinces. Enclosed: New China Bank draft for 3,600 yuan, legal tender for 400 yuan, Shanghai Bank check for 1,000 yuan, totaling 5,000 yuan, and a draft of the letter of thanks." It is reported that the Flood Relief Association has issued receipts, sent thank-you letters, and promptly remitted the relief funds to the disaster areas for distribution.</p>
<h3>The Jisheng Society Manages Winter Relief in Shuyang</h3>
<p>Jointly Managed by the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association</p>
<p>The China Jisheng Society's work in managing the Tianmen flood relief efforts is nearing completion. Now, in light of the dire situation in the disaster-stricken areas of northern Jiangsu, especially in Shuyang County, Haizhou, and with winter approaching and the bitter winds chilling to the bone, the society is deeply concerned about the disaster victims who lack clothing and food and are facing starvation. Therefore, it has jointly organized winter relief efforts with the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association. Director Li Yunmen and Mr. Li Yushu of the Qingjiang Branch have been dispatched to the disaster areas to investigate and distribute relief. Food and cotton clothing have been prepared and will be shipped soon. However, due to the severity of the disaster and the large number of victims, these modest efforts are like a drop in the bucket. Further assistance is urgently needed. We earnestly hope that kind-hearted gentlemen from all regions, mindful of the victims' desperate need for help, will share their surplus and cultivate fields of merit to expand this charitable cause.</p>

<h3>Jin Chuxiang Discusses Recent Five Years of Salted Fish Imports</h3>
<p>Poor Sales Lead to Reduced Imports</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the Guowen News Agency interviewed Mr. Jin Chuxiang, secretary of the Salted Fish Association in this city, regarding the import situation of salted fish. According to him, imported salted fish mainly consists of salmon and qingchuan fish. Salmon comes from Kamchatka in the Russian Sea and Sakhalin in Japan, while qingchuan fish comes from Seattle and Canada, etc. These goods first came to China two years before the founding of the Republic. The peak period was from 1924 to 1925, when annual imports were about 500,000 to 600,000 dan. After these types of fish are imported, they are mostly distributed in Ningbo, Hangzhou, Shanghai, Wuxi, and other places. Guangdong and Fujian also frequently come to Shanghai to purchase them. In recent years, due to rural bankruptcy, increased tariffs, and higher costs, sales have been greatly affected. The import situation of foreign salted fish in the past five years is listed below:</p>
<p>Salmon Import Situation (Fish Unit: Quintal, Price Unit: Yuan)</p>
<p>Import Year Origin Import (Dan) Average Price Per Quintal Tariff Per Dan</p>

<p>Construction Begins on the 26th, Presided Over by Rongzeng Kanbu</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that prominent figures in Shanghai, including Jian Yujie, Wen Lanting, Wang Zhen, Qu Yingguang, Huang Qinglan, and Guan Jiongzhi, etc., in view of the increasing demonic influences and the nation's troubles, have decided to hold a Great White Umbrella Calamity Pacification Dharma Assembly for three days starting on the 26th of this month at the Jueyuan Buddhist Pure Land Society at 418 Hart Road, to eliminate the calamities. The Dharma Assembly will be presided over by Rongzeng Kanbu, the representative of the Panchen Lama of Tibet. It is said that this major Dharma Assembly is second only to the Vajra Dharma Assembly in its great power. The Datong News Agency reporter has recorded its notice and public announcement below:</p>
<p>Notice</p>
<p>In view of the increasing demonic influences and the nation's troubles, we believe that we can only rely on the power of the Buddha to secretly eliminate them. Therefore, we have decided to respectfully invite Rongzeng Kanbu, the translator and guide of the Bodhi Society, and eminent monks from Mongolia and Tibet to conduct the Great White Umbrella Calamity Pacification Dharma Assembly for three full days, starting on November 26th and ending on the 28th. On the afternoon of the 29th at 1:00 PM, the Great Initiation Dharma will be transmitted. Starting on the 30th, Master Jingquan will expound the Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva Sutra of Original Vows every afternoon from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM. The Master is a dragon and elephant of the Dharma, excelling in both practice and understanding. We hope that all benefactors from all walks of life will generate a heart of joy and join in this auspicious occasion. We earnestly invite you.</p>
<p>Public Announcement</p>
<p>It is said that the mind, the Buddha, and sentient beings are originally no different. Humans, deities, and the six realms take their own retribution. To transform the collective karma of delusion and cleanse the impurities of the five turbidities, it is necessary to receive the blessings of the Buddha's Dharma and also for the multitude to exert their sincerity. We and others, in view of the increasing demonic influences and the nation's troubles, respectfully invite the Tibetan Master Rongzeng and several eminent monks from Mongolia and Tibet to initiate a Calamity Pacification Dharma Assembly at our society starting on the 26th of this month, and sincerely cultivate the Great White Umbrella Dharma, hoping to rely on compassion to secretly eliminate the adversities. It will be completed on the 28th, and on the afternoon of the 29th at 1:00 PM, the White Umbrella Initiation will be transmitted at our society. We deeply hope that all benefactors from all walks of life will enthusiastically participate, showing sincere repentance and purifying the Dharma gathering, so that the mind of sentient beings can purify itself and transform the karma created by sentient beings. Knowing that phenomena arise from conditions and are without inherent nature, and that sin and blessings are originally empty, we can forget both the attachment to the Dharma and benefit both ourselves and others. May all the gods, dragons, and elephants protect this magnificent event, and may the land and rivers from now on together return to tranquility. This is our joy.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Health Explains the Procedures for Registering Prepared Medicines</h3>
<p>The National United Association of Pharmaceutical Industries received a notice from the Ministry of Health to the provincial governments explaining the procedures for registering prepared medicines. The notice stated that Article 4 of the Regulations for the Management of Prepared Medicines stipulates that those who formulate or import prepared medicines should, upon obtaining a business license, apply for registration with the competent authority in the locality of their business. Therefore, all prepared medicines that have been examined and approved by the Ministry and issued a prepared medicine license should apply for registration with the local health administrative authority before they can be sold. This is to facilitate the local competent authorities in supervising and managing the prepared medicines sold in the market. Since these prepared medicines have already obtained a license from the Ministry, the registration procedures should be simplified as much as possible to avoid causing difficulties for the pharmaceutical merchants in the execution of the procedures, so as to achieve the management results as soon as possible. The Ministry has formulated four principles for the registration procedures of prepared medicines: (1) The registration authority is the Provincial Health Department or the Health Experiment Office. If there is no such agency, the province is the Civil Affairs Department. In the city directly under the Executive Yuan, it is the Municipal Government or its directly affiliated health authority. The municipal and county governments and public security bureaus or the health authorities in each county under the province shall not re-register. (2) Those who formulate or import prepared medicines shall, after obtaining the prepared medicine license, immediately submit the license or a copy of the license issued by the Ministry of Health to the competent authority in the locality of their business for registration with the registration authority specified in the preceding paragraph. (3) The approval of the registration procedures shall be delivered by approval in order to be simple and concise, and the affiliated municipal and county governments and competent authorities shall be notified. There is no need to issue a separate registration certificate. (4) The registration authority shall not charge registration fees in order to ease the difficulties of the merchants. The above was submitted to the Executive Yuan for instructions, which stated that it should be approved for implementation. It is hoped that the department will circulate it for compliance and also transfer it to its affiliated agencies for general information.</p>
<h3>The Old Building of the Fuzhou Road Police Station Will Be Demolished Today</h3>
<p>After the General Police Station of Fuzhou Road in the Public Concession moved to the new building at the corner of Fuzhou Road and Henan Road, the old building, due to its age and dilapidation, was deemed unusable.

<h3>Seasoning Factories Decide to Increase Prices by 10% of the Selling Price</h3>
<p>Recently, due to soaring raw material prices, various industries and factories have been raising prices. Yesterday, Tianyi, Tiansheng, Taiyi, Tianran, Tianyuan, Far East, Tianxiang, and other seasoning factories jointly decided to increase the selling price of seasonings by 10% of the original price, effective from today. The notice is recorded below: "Dear Sirs, due to the soaring prices of raw materials, the costs of our industry have increased sharply, making it difficult to maintain operations.

<h3>The County Government Strictly Investigates Concealed Public Property</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government is currently investigating public land and property in the county. Due to the passage of time, inspections are difficult, and due to unclear boundaries, some property has been encroached upon. Therefore, County Magistrate Ye has specially dispatched personnel to conduct a detailed investigation in accordance with Article 9 of the provincial regulations on property clearance. If anyone knows of public property that has been encroached upon or concealed, they may report the facts. Once verified, the matter will be handled according to law.</p>
<h3>The County Government is Ordered to Clear Outstanding Taxes</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government has received an order from the province stating that land tax revenue is included in the budget, and there should not be any arrears. However, in recent years, various industries have arbitrarily delayed payment, and large households relying on their power have accumulated huge arrears, which has greatly affected the provincial and county treasuries. Despite repeated efforts to rectify the situation, deeply ingrained habits persist, and the rural economy is distressed, resulting in little improvement in tax collection. This year's autumn harvest is abundant, and the rural economy should be better than in previous years. Accumulated land tax arrears from previous years must be strictly cleared. After receiving the order, the county government, in addition to instructing the directors of land tax collection in each district and the township chiefs to comply, has also issued a public notice to all property owners that if they pay off the outstanding taxes from previous years, the late payment fines will be waived in full as a gesture of consideration.</p>
<h3>The Xinzha Branch Continues to Capture a Gang of Thieves</h3>
<p>It was reported in yesterday's newspaper that the detective team of the Xinzha Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau had recently uncovered a gang of eleven thieves and seized two handguns. It is now known that the handgun seized from Bai Langlin in a shed on Datong Road had the number 662 and contained four live rounds. The double-barreled handgun seized from Wang Xiaoliuzi in Sandeli, Tanziwan, had the number 493 and contained seven bullets, as well as other stolen goods. After a brief interrogation, they confessed that other accomplices were hiding in various places. Therefore, Squad Leader Bao Shi of the Second Division dispatched detectives Liu Bingrong and Yang Yucai, along with informant Lu Jinkang, to a bungalow at No. 14 Bailinan Road under the jurisdiction of the Caojiadu Police Station at about 9:00 PM that evening. A female suspect, Zhu Shen, was apprehended. After being brought to the team for questioning, she confessed that she was 43 years old, from Huai'an, and her husband had passed away. She admitted to transporting handguns for the gang, but denied participating in the robberies. According to other thieves, they confessed to multiple robbery cases. To avoid wrongly accusing innocent people, Squad Leader Bao Shi of the Second Division dispatched officers to retrieve a portion of the stolen goods, and the victims were summoned to identify them. The case is currently under investigation.</p>

<h3>A Horrific Accident: Cart Carrying Heavy Iron Barrels Collapses, Cart Driver Crushed to Death, Head Turned into a Patty, Brain Matter and Blood Gushing Out</h3>
<p>A Tragedy Involving the Transportation of Iron Beer Barrels by the Shanghai Brewery Company</p>
<p>The Shanghai Brewery Company, due to the expansion and construction of a new factory on Yichang Road, planned to transport sixty iron barrels storing beer from the old factory on Gedeng Road to the new factory. The relocation and installation were contracted to Liyuan Construction Company, which was building the new factory. However, Yang Yinhai, a local engineer of the brewery company, believed that the distance between the old and new factories was only a few dozen storefronts, and despite the fact that each iron barrel weighed two tons, he thought the matter was easy. Therefore, he subcontracted the transportation and installation project from Liyuan, agreeing on a fee of 25 yuan per barrel for transportation and installation. Yang initially planned to transport them by truck, but since the truck company required 10 yuan per barrel, only for transportation and not installation, he thought it was too expensive. He then hired Qiu Rongsheng, a cart driver from Tongzhou living at No. 78 Yadeli Road. The agreed transportation fee was 5 yuan per barrel. However, the cart's load capacity was limited to one ton by the Public Works Department of the Engineering Bureau, while each iron barrel weighed two tons. Such heavy objects were not originally meant to be carried by wooden carts. Qiu and Yang, tempted by profit, disregarded the danger and rashly assigned cart drivers Wei Changgui, Wang Songsheng, Zhou Hongji, Zhang Xishun, Zhu Dachang, and more than ten coolies to pull the cart to the old factory on Gedeng Road for transportation. However, the iron barrels were placed inside the factory, so they had to be loaded onto the cart inside the factory. Due to their bulky nature, Yang Yinhai used a crane to lift the barrels and place them on the cart, and then the coolies dragged the cart out of the factory, down the steps outside the factory, and onto the road. Unexpectedly, as the cart began to descend, and the front wheels reached the road, the weight on the cart lost its balance. In addition, the cart's axle was rotten, making it even more unable to withstand the bumpiness. With a crash, the front wheel broke, and the round iron barrel on the cart fell and rolled over. The cart drivers, seeing a major disaster about to occur, rushed to escape. However, Wei Changgui was unable to escape in time, and was knocked down by the iron barrel, which rolled over his head, instantly crushing his head into a patty. Brain matter and fresh blood gushed out, a gruesome sight to behold. Afterwards, it was learned that the cart drivers' wages, as agreed with Qiu, were 600 cash per barrel per person. Wei Changgui sacrificed himself for 600 cash. After the accident, the local police immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. They sent Wei's body to the coroner's office for a court examination and coffin burial. They also detained Qiu and Yang and sent them to the Special First Court the next morning. Zhang Tianyin, a police lawyer, charged them with negligent homicide under Article 276 of the Criminal Law. Judge Liu Yugui questioned them about the circumstances of the accident and ordered them to be detained. Yesterday was the date for the continued hearing. Judge Liu again took the bench for the trial. After detailed questioning, he ordered the two defendants to be detained and scheduled another hearing.</p>
<h3>Japanese Man Buying Cash is Robbed of Chinese Legal Tender</h3>
<p>Totaling 11,860 Yuan</p>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily, Tanaka Kazuo, a Japanese Ishikawa Prefecture resident and tailor at No. 93 Yong'anli, Beisichuan Road, hired a Chinese man, Lin Bohong, as a diplomat. Lin had previously worked at the Xiaozaki Hospital and was fluent in Japanese. Recently, Lin was entrusted by Yuan Kangxing to introduce Japanese people who wanted to buy cash. Tanaka reported this to Kondo Taro's son, the owner of the "Hinode" Inn at No. 92, Lane 332, Yifeng Road, Wusong Road. Kondo then entrusted others to buy cash, stating that one yuan of cash could buy 1.32 yuan of legal tender, with 0.22 yuan as commission. On the 19th, Tanaka and Lin went to Houkang Company and agreed that cash would be delivered on the 23rd and the transaction would take place at the Houkang office in Xiang'anli, Gongguan Road, in the French Concession. Lin left home before 5:00 PM that day and went with Kondo's three sons, Tanaka, and "Hinode" hotel guests Miyoshi Heiichi and Mizuno to exchange the money. They claimed that there was no cash in the Houkang Company and it had been sent to Room 205 of the Great China Hotel. So Tanaka, Miyoshi, Mizuno, Lin, and others went to the Great China Hotel, while Kondo remained at the Houkang Company on Gongguan Road. At 6:00 PM, three thugs suddenly robbed Kondo of 11,860 yuan in banknotes and fled. The Japanese Consulate General, after receiving the report, went to investigate the various locations. In addition to detaining all the relevant persons, Tanaka was suspected of being involved and is currently under investigation.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Public Security Bureau Sets a Deadline for the Inspection of Public Places</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Municipal Public Security Bureau believes that public places in the city have not paid sufficient attention to cleanliness and hygiene and should be rectified. Therefore, since July 1st of this year, it has begun to send personnel to various places to encourage improvement and announced the implementation of new transportation methods in various public places, such as hotels, tea houses, and sports halls, ordering them to comply. After an initial inspection, a follow-up inspection was conducted to observe whether improvements had been made, so as to ensure that they pay attention to neatness and simplicity. After repeated inspections by the bureau's police officers for several months, most of the various places in the city have been able to automatically implement the announced methods, which is a significant improvement compared to the past. Therefore, the authorities of the bureau have decided to end this work on Saturday of this week (the 30th).</p>

<h3>Zhu Baoyuan's Inheritance Dispute Unresolved</h3>
<p>Two Sons Promised Payments to Two Daughters, But Did Not Pay After Reaching a Settlement —The Lawsuit Concluded with a Scheduled Verdict—</p>
<p>Zhenhe Tea Shop owner, Zhu Baoyuan, from Hai Ning, came from humble beginnings. Fortunately, he worked hard in middle age and became very wealthy, accumulating millions. Baoyuan had two sons and two daughters. The sons were named Yanqing and Shunqing, and the daughters were named Jun and Meizhen. Zhu Jun married a man surnamed Shi, and Meizhen married a man surnamed Wang. When their father was alive, Yanqing and Shunqing, knowing their father's frugality, traveled outside all year round, never using carriages. Since their father's death two years ago, benefiting from his legacy, they each acquired carriages and frequented trading markets, managing businesses. All of Baoyuan's inheritance was then in the hands of Yanqing and Shunqing. However, Shi Zhu Jun and Wang Zhu Meizhen, who were already married, initially had no share. This led to an inheritance dispute among the siblings last year. Fortunately, someone intervened and mediated, with Yanqing and Shunqing dividing the inheritance and giving each of their two sisters 80,000 yuan. A settlement agreement was signed, stipulating that the money would be paid in installments, but the payment period should not exceed one year. Zhu Jun and Zhu Meizhen then withdrew the lawsuit. However, since the agreement was signed, more than a year has passed, and Yanqing and others have only paid 80,000 yuan in installments. Among them, 20,000 yuan was a check guaranteed by Wang Wenzhi, the manager of Zhengda Bank, for payment upon maturity, but it was not honored. Therefore, the sisters filed another lawsuit against Wang for payment. The remaining 80,000 yuan had also been repeatedly demanded without success, so they hired lawyer Gu Changyuan to sue Zhu Yanqing, Zhu Shunqing, and Wang Wenzhi in the First Special District Court, recounting the details of the settlement agreement and the amount of money received in installments, seeking a judgment ordering the defendants to fulfill the settlement agreement and pay the remaining 80,000 yuan, as well as statutory interest for the delay. The court approved the petition and summoned them once on the previous Saturday. Because the defendants had not yet voted, the court ordered a rescheduled summons. These details were previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday was the rescheduled hearing date, and Judge Shen continued the hearing, summoning witness Zhao Jingpu to testify, proving that the two plaintiffs had indeed only received 80,000 yuan. The defendants claimed that they had paid 120,000 yuan. After the judge's questioning, it was revealed that 40,000 yuan was related to another incident and had nothing to do with this case. In court, the two plaintiffs presented evidence requesting the court to order the defendants to fulfill the settlement agreement and pay the remaining amount. After the lawyers for both sides argued, Judge Shen, finding the case clear, announced the end of the debate and scheduled the verdict for the afternoon of the 28th of this month.</p>
<h3>An Elderly Man Collapses After Taking Poison</h3>
<p>Rescuers Unable to Save Him</p>
<p>At 2:45 PM on the 19th of this month, an elderly man over sixty with white hair was found lying on the ground near the Liu Family Lane entrance on Avenue Road in the French Concession, in a daze and suffering from illness. He was dressed like a middle-class merchant. A patrolman discovered him and reported it to the Fochu Police Station, which sent an investigator. After questioning, his name was Zhang Rongsheng, 63 years old, and he spoke with a Zhejiang accent. He was immediately sent to the Red Cross General Hospital on Haig Road for treatment. After examination, the doctor determined that the elderly man had committed suicide by poisoning and also suffered from lung disease. Due to ineffective medical intervention, he died at 8:30 PM the day before yesterday. The hospital notified the French Police Station, which sent an investigator to transport the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for an autopsy. The prosecutor arrived to confirm that the deceased had indeed died from poisoning. The body was handed over to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for photographing and burial, pending identification by relatives.</p>
<h3>Discussions with Qian Chengxu and Hu Xiyuan Regarding the Impact of Soaring Raw Material Prices</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance implemented the Legal Tender, raw material prices have soared. Yesterday, a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency interviewed Qian Chengxu, a member of the Shanghai Chinese Industrial Association, and Hu Xiyuan, a member of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, separately. Their statements are recorded below:</p>
<p>Qian Chengxu's Statement</p>
<p>According to Qian Chengxu, a member of the Chinese Industrial Association, the association has considered the issue of rising raw material prices and the failure of commodity prices to rise at the same rate. Therefore, it was brought up for discussion at the previous members' meeting. During this transition period, what steps should be taken from a production standpoint to balance the relationship between production and sales in this difficult situation? Furthermore, the government has repeatedly issued orders to merchants in various regions, prohibiting them from raising prices. Does the scope of "prices" refer only to general commodities? What effects can this regulation have? Based on the situation in the past week, it seems that the effects are difficult to predict. This only concerns the imbalance between raw material and finished product prices. Regarding the circulation and use of currency, based on my observations, there was a shortage of currency in the past, causing difficulties for both farmers and manufacturers. Now that the situation has changed, from an economic perspective, financial trends may gradually become more active, and various sectors may become more prosperous and developed as a result. However, if there are no other measures to distribute the increased currency evenly to the general public, farmers, and manufacturers while simultaneously increasing currency and concentrating cash, then commodity prices will rise, manufacturing will increase, and market purchasing power will remain weak, which means there will be high prices but no market. Considering the government's aim to control finance, and considering the domestic market and foreign trade, it is difficult to achieve immediate results. Therefore, this association believes that under the current financial organization conditions, since the government is seeking a suitable way out for the national economy by centralizing gold and reforming the currency system, it should also promote the connection and integration of industry and commerce under a consistent policy. Under the guidance of the government, a sound financial market should be organized to provide a large amount of capital to mortgage factory stocks, valuable securities, and real estate, so that all illiquid notes in production can be converted into liquid capital to be effective. If this can be achieved, not only can stagnant goods be turned into liquid commodities to replace cash, but the increase in currency can also be effective, and the country's production volume can also increase accordingly.</p>
<p>Hu Xiyuan's Statement</p>
<p>According to Hu Xiyuan, a member of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, since the implementation of the Legal Tender, currency has become more active, and there is hope for the rescue of rural areas. Domestic purchasing power can gradually increase, and the prices of various commodities will rise reasonably on a level playing field based on their needs, leading industry and commerce into a state of prosperity. This is what we all hope for. However, observing the situation of various industries recently, during this transition period of the implementation of the Legal Tender, there is an uneven distribution of benefits. The reason for this is the rapid rise in raw material prices. For example, the price increase of cotton cloth is not as high as the price increase of cotton. The price of silk has soared, but the selling price of silk products has not increased sufficiently. However, this can be attributed to international trade relations, environmental trends, and the inability to prevent it. As for the majority of miscellaneous materials needed by light industry, according to the survey, most of them are not significantly affected. However, due to the psychological impact of currency system reform, raw material merchants have suddenly raised prices, which is very common. Small and medium-sized factories with insufficient inventory are facing a painful situation: on the one hand, purchasing power has not increased sharply, and selling prices cannot be raised; on the other hand, high-priced raw materials have been purchased, and costs have suddenly increased. Under this contradictory environment, they feel deep pain. As a result, the products of manufacturing plants are stagnating, and the transactions of raw material merchants are also hesitant. This has led to sluggish sales of goods in all aspects. We should first urge raw material merchants to be aware of this self-inflicted situation in order to seek mutual benefits. I believe that industrial and commercial groups should persuade raw material merchants in various regions not to seek excessive price increases for various raw materials, so as not to reduce their own business and increase the costs of manufacturing plants.</p>
<h3>Falsely Claiming Six Bags of Medicinal Herbs —Actually Filled with Poisonous Materials— Suspicions Aroused by Panicked Behavior —Several Key Suspects Apprehended On-Site</h3>
<p>At 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, at the Shanghai South Railway Station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, a man claiming to be a merchant named Wang Changgen, 23 years old, from Jianqiao, Hangzhou, arrived by French Concession car with six flour sacks. He stored them in the station's back door export cargo warehouse for transportation, entrusting Xie Da Xing Forwarding Company to declare the shipment to Lanxi, falsely claiming that the flour sacks contained six items of medicinal herbs. The forwarding company informed him that, according to regulations, they needed to see the merchant's business letter, the name of the goods, and the quantity before they could declare the shipment; otherwise, they could not accept the shipment. Upon hearing this, the merchant Wang Changgen replied that he would go and get the letter. His words and actions were panicked. The company's employees suspected something was amiss, so they sent an employee to follow Wang Changgen to get the letter. However, when Wang reached the Old West Gate, he suddenly tried to flee to the concession. Therefore, the company's employee, Shen, apprehended him and took him to the West Gate Police Station to report to Detective Team Leader Shen Wenda. Shen Wenda reported to Chief Yao and requested instructions. Chief Yao immediately led the detective team, including Shen Wenda and detective Zhao Renxin, took the suspect Wang Changgen, and prepared an official letter to Station Master Zhou Binwu to inspect the cargo warehouse with police officer Han of the Police Section. After a joint inspection and opening of the sacks, it was discovered that they contained the poisonous raw material red pill, 77.9 kilograms of rough material white sugar powder, 11 kilograms of fine material white powder, and 14 kilograms of morphine mixed into the white powder, with a considerable value. After the inspection, the items remained stored in the station's cargo warehouse under the guard of railway police. Wang Changgen was taken to the police station. At that time, a man was seen loitering suspiciously at the station. He was detained and taken to the West Gate Police Station for interrogation. He confessed his name was Hu Zhirong, 32 years old, from Jinhua. The white powder poison was entrusted to me by Ye Zicai (39 years old, from Taizhou), who lives at 21 Renshou Lane, Wangzhi Road, French Concession, to be handed over to Wang Changgen for transportation to the South Railway Station for shipment to Lanxi. Based on the confession, Detective Team Leader Shen dispatched Deputy Leader Ban Ruhai and detectives Liu Wenhui and Jiao Baojun that night, accompanied by the suspect Hu Zhirong, to the French Concession. They coordinated with Chinese and foreign detectives from the police station and arrested Ye Zicai at 21 Renshou Lane, Wangzhi Road, and took him to the police station for detention. Because yesterday was Sunday and the office was closed, the West Gate Police Station prepared a document and sent the original detectives, Yu Ruhai and others, to the police station to take custody of him for interrogation to clarify the truth of the case.</p>
<h3>Zhang Wubo Appeals in Paternity Confirmation Case — Forensic Institute's Blood Type Test Shows a Match —Zhang Disagrees with Verdict and Appeals to the Supreme Court</h3>
<p>Zhang Wubo, an employee of Yongtai Chang Trading Company in Taihe Lane, Fuzhou Road, and a native of Zhenjiang, had illicit relations with Fang Aying, a 14-year-old girl from Dinghai, years ago. After she gave birth to a boy named Zhimin, he abandoned them. Fang filed a lawsuit, which was initially lost. Recently, she hired lawyer Chen Zhen to appeal to the Supreme Court, which overturned the previous verdict and sent it back to the Second Branch of the High Court for a new trial. The verdict was announced last month based on the forensic institute's report, which stated that Zhang Wubo, Fang Aying, and the child had the same blood type. It also considered the similarities in facial features between Zhang and the child, the testimony of key witness Wang Binglin, and the fact that Fang Aying pointed out Zhang Wubo's transverse scar in his groin in court. It was determined that Zhang and Fang did have a cohabitation relationship, and Zhimin was indeed Zhang's biological son. Unexpectedly, Zhang was still dissatisfied with the verdict. His lawyer, Xiong Fei, submitted a petition to the Second Branch of the High Court, requesting that it be forwarded to the Supreme Court to launch an appeal, listing five reasons. The first and second reasons attacked the witnesses. The third reason stated that Fang's knowledge of the scar on his lower body was not sufficient proof of cohabitation, as it could easily be inquired about. It was also argued that transverse scars and hemorrhoids are the same kind of private ailment. Zhang's sister-in-law had suffered from hemorrhoids, and Zhang knew about it. To use her as an example, if it were also said that Zhang had cohabited with his sister-in-law, wouldn't that be absurd? The fourth reason stated that identical or similar blood types could not immediately confirm that someone was a biological parent, and the similarity in facial features was denied. The fifth reason was a repeated argument against Fang Aying and Zhimin's age, requesting that the original verdict be overturned and the first-instance verdict be upheld. Since Zhang was proceeding with a third-instance appeal, Fang Aying and her son Zhimin also retained lawyer Chen Zhen to submit a reply. The reply stated that the original verdict had been changed, confirming that Zhimin was Zhang Wubo's biological son, allowing the oppressed illegitimate children of the world to finally have their grievances redressed. Unexpectedly, Zhang was so malicious and did not realize that he should accept this fair trial. He used the appeal process as a tool to delay the litigation, still making pointless arguments. His intentions were truly unfortunate for the father and son. The reply addressed Zhang's five reasons for appeal, one by one, based on various facts from the past. It was stated that Wang Binglin was Zhang's close friend. If he had not been summoned, he would have been bribed by Zhang and would never have been allowed to appear in court. Therefore, Zhang was speechless when he heard Wang's consistent testimony. The Forensic Institute is a special government agency. When the court's forensic doctors cannot examine the details of the situation, they rely on the institute's conclusions. After the institute's examination in this case, the results, based on various aspects, confirmed that Zhimin was born to Zhang and Fang. If this examination could be overturned, then the institute could also be dismissed. Zhang's appeal contains many far-fetched arguments that are not worth laughing at. In short, facts speak louder than words, and the truth is not difficult to uncover. It should not be allowed for him to cunningly extend and exploit the situation. It is requested that the human rights of illegitimate children be protected, the appeal be rejected, the original verdict be upheld, and the ancestral legal fees be borne. It is said that the Second Branch of the High Court has submitted the pleadings of both parties, along with the entire case file, to the Supreme Court for a hearing.</p>

<h3>Correspondence Respectfully Informing Electrical Users</h3>
<p>— Qian Hongfan</p>
<p>Recently, a newspaper reported that a certain university female student died from electric shock while taking a bath. After reading this, I couldn't help but feel惋惜. In recent times, electrical appliances have become increasingly popular, and deaths from electric shock are not uncommon. For safety reasons, it is necessary to install a grounding wire. The principle is described below. It is known that the low-voltage power distribution devices commonly used everywhere today generally adopt a three-phase four-wire grounding system, that is, in addition to the three live wires, another fourth wire is added as the neutral wire. This neutral wire is connected to the ground. Therefore, there is a considerable potential difference between each phase (i.e., each live wire) and the ground. The voltage is usually 200 volts or 220 volts. Electrical appliances, such as three-phase motors, etc., connect their three wires to the three phases of the power supply. Variable-line appliances, such as stoves, electric lights, irons, fans, etc., connect one wire to one phase of the power supply, and the other wire to the neutral wire of the power supply (i.e., the above-mentioned fourth wire). If such appliances leak electricity due to insulation damage, the metal part of its outer casing will have a considerable voltage with the ground. If there is no circuit between the outer casing and the ground, then when we accidentally touch it, the current will pass through the body and reach the ground. If the ground on which one stands is dry, and the area of contact between the body and the outer casing of the appliance is not large, and the skin is thick and dry, then the current flow will be small due to the high resistance, and the person will only be slightly startled. However, if the contact area is large and the ground is wet, the resistance of the current will be small, and the current can cause nerve spasms, and in severe cases, it can be fatal. According to expert tests, a current of more than 0.09 amps passing through the human body is dangerous. From this perspective, the installation of electrical appliances in bathrooms should be especially cautious, because being in a bathtub provides extremely close contact with the ground, as the bathtub is connected to the main water pipe through branch pipes, and the main water pipe is buried deep in the ground. At the same time, the contact point between the body and the electrical appliance is easily conductive due to moisture. Therefore, if the electrical appliance leaks electricity, touching it can be fatal. The above-mentioned danger is very easy to avoid. The method is to install a grounding wire on the metal part of the outer casing of the electrical appliance to connect it to the ground. In this way, the leakage current will pass through the ground through the grounding wire, and there will be no problem when we touch it. This grounding device is extremely important. In modern countries, some have stipulated it by law. Various parts of our country have paid little attention to the grounding equipment of electrical appliances. It is imperative to actively promote this. Users should also seriously urge installation workers to make effective installations, so that unnecessary disasters can be avoided.</p>

<h3>A Visit to the Gongqin Iron Factory</h3>
<p>— Jinhua Ting</p>
<p>The Need for Round Nails and Barbed Wire in Industry and Military Affairs</p>
<p>(1) The Iron and Steel Industry and the Strength of the Nation</p>
<p>The iron and steel industry occupies an extremely important position in the necessary conditions for modern countries. From military affairs and transportation to construction, nothing does not use steel as its main material. Therefore, the strength of a country and the prosperity of the iron and steel industry are greatly related. Our country has never paid attention to the iron and steel industry. Therefore, all steel raw materials for national construction are dependent on others. Even the smallest of nails are sought from foreign goods. Although in recent years, Chinese people have gradually paid attention to this, all steel products needed for military and industrial purposes that can be manufactured domestically are researched and manufactured with all efforts. However, the raw materials still need to be supplied by others, which is not a fundamental solution. It is hoped that the government and the people will pay attention to this. The Shanghai Gongqin Iron Factory has been working hard in the iron industry for more than ten years. Although it is limited by capital and raw materials, it has not been able to make great contributions, but it has achieved considerable success in military barbed wire and industrial round nails. Moreover, the machines used by the factory can all be manufactured from the 20 sets of master machines, which is also commendable.</p>
<p>(2) The Origin of Round Nails and Wire Mesh</p>
<p>Our country's manufacturing industry is still a by-product of blacksmiths. The manufacturing method uses manual labor, the shape is rough, the color is dark, and it is easy to rust, which does not meet modern needs. Later, machine-made foreign nails were imported, and hand-hammered iron nails were invisibly defeated. At the same time, there was also a leakage. It is said that machine-made round nails were invented by France. France was also the earliest country to import them into our country. Later, European and American countries competed to imitate them. In 1780, Germany and France began to import a small number of round nails into the United States. Because they met the needs of the American people, those who were engaged in this industry at that time [missing text]. In 1917, the United States was able to produce 17 million barrels of the same round nails annually. In 1927, it increased to 29.94 million barrels. There are more than 30 large and small nail factories in Japan. Among them, the two largest are located within the state-run steel plant, producing more than 1,000 barrels of round nails per day. The total annual nail production is about 3 million barrels. Except for a small number of sales to the South Seas Islands and Northeast China, the rest are self-sufficient. According to the latest statistics, our country consumes about 5-600,000 barrels of round nails every year (100 pounds per barrel). After the implementation of various constructions, the required quantity of round nails will greatly increase. In the past, we relied on imports. Now, there are domestic products that can be used as substitutes. It is still unknown which country invented the wire mesh. However, according to Mr. Huang Junjie, the general manager of Gong [missing character] Bo Factory, the United States was the first to use this type of wire mesh, and the quantity was also the largest. Wire mesh is divided into two types. One is barbed wire, which is used for military [missing characters] and construction. The other is non-barbed wire, which is used for residential gardens or railway station building protection nets.</p>
<p>(3) The Founding of the Gongqin Iron Factory</p>
<p>The Gongqin Iron Factory was founded by Huang Bogeng, Gu Xinyi, and Ding Ren [missing character] of the iron industry. It was established in the eleventh year of the Republic of China with a paid-in capital of 100,000 national currency. The scope of manufacturing was initially focused on sand-turning machines, with the intention of manufacturing various application components to replace imports. Therefore, all necessary master machines, such as lathes, planers, pliers, and molds, were fully equipped. Later, due to excessive costs and the expansion of foreign goods, it was difficult to develop the business. Therefore, it was planned to change the plan. At that time, Dr. Perlenz, the former president of Tongji University, visited the factory and pointed out that the demand for iron nails was quite extensive, and there were no such products in China. He also presented his complete book on the nail factory plan and strongly advised the factory to add a nail-making department to increase income and cultivate the factory's capital. At the same time, Dr. Wu Renzhi, the former director of the Hanyang Iron and Steel Plant, after visiting the factory, strongly supported the addition of a nail-making department. After repeated consideration by the factory's board of directors, it was resolutely adopted. In the twelfth year of the Republic of China, the nail-making department was established. At the beginning, only four German machines were installed for testing. Due to a lack of experience, the results were not as expected. Later, with the assistance of Manager Huang Junjie, he devoted himself to research and began to understand the principles. The skills gradually improved from clumsy to coarse. The results became increasingly perfect. However, the raw materials were quite difficult. Purchasing new goods was too costly, and using old materials was often prone to exhaustion. Therefore, a wire-drawing department was set up to draw wire by itself to support it. It was expected that the raw materials for wire and nails would be self-sufficient from then on. Unexpectedly, the situation in Jiangsu and Zhejiang coincided with the meeting. At times, there was disturbance, affecting finance. The factory was forced to stop work painfully. When the war subsided, it was again plagued by the economy. The nail-making department had to be rented out to cooperate with foreign merchants. The colleagues of the factory worked hard for others and were more self-conscious. All the improvements in nail-making work and the investigation of the nail industry abroad were carefully explored and devoted to nothing. At the same time, they were eager to restore the parent factory. When the national government was established, it attached great importance to the revitalization of industry. The colleagues of the factory believed that the time had come. They presented the difficulties and hardships they had experienced to the two departments of industry and commerce and finance. They submitted a letter of opinion on increasing the import tax rate of foreign nails to the authorities. At the same time, they united various industrial groups to petition in Beijing. All of this was nothing more than a countermeasure to get rid of the constraints of foreign merchants and restore the original foundation. At that time, the cooperating foreign merchants happened to have another organization, and they terminated the contract with each other. The factory base was able to be restored. Huang Gengbo, the director of the factory, personally went to the capital to present the facts to the competent departments. On the one hand, he ordered the convening of a debt director meeting to try to resume work. This was in the nineteenth year of the Republic of China. At that time, there were only eight nail machines, and only one or twenty barrels of round nails were produced per day. On New Year's Day of the 20th year, the government promulgated a new tariff, which was able to adopt the factory's opinion on the tax rate as much as possible. At the same time, Mr. Cai Renchu, who was enthusiastic about industry, sincerely cooperated. The working capital was sufficient. The internal organization was also able to gradually improve in an orderly manner. In October of the same year, Cai was rewarded by the government for being the first to manufacture round nails (special industrial products), and was allowed to export duty-free. Therefore, the sales of round nails in various ports increased sharply, and the business also improved. The factory's capital was initially 100,000, and it has now increased to 200,000.</p>
<p>(4) The Organization and Products of the Factory</p>
<p>The content of the factory is divided into five items: organization, management, equipment, business, and products. The general situation is as follows. (1) Organization: In accordance with the Limited Company Regulations, it applied to the Ministry of Industry for registration. The capital is 200,000 yuan.

It can be called perfect. (4) Business: The sales of goods in the local area are handled by well-known firms. In other ports, such as the Yangtze River area, there are special managers. In South China, there are branch factories. According to statistics, the annual business of round nails is more than one million yuan. Wire fences and other new products such as nails are widely sold because the Chinese people have a considerable understanding of them. (5) Products: A. Main products: Round nails from 4 points to 6 inches. Other products include shoe nails, copper nails, oil felt nails, double-pointed nails, riding buckle nails, small cap nails, floor nails, square nails, and other special nails. B. Wire fences and various installations, such as residences, gardens, schools, hospitals, parks, stadiums, factories, ferries, cemeteries, mausoleums, lakesides, mountain villas, airports, gymnasiums, planting grounds, zoos, swimming pools, railway stations, highway protection nets, etc., and wire fabrics, such as tidal machine protection nets, stove grates, letter baskets, flower baskets, bird baskets, etc. In addition, a barbed one is specially supplied for military use, commonly known as barbed wire. C. Nail-making machine. The English term (Machire Shop) machine factory. Originally, it was the manufacture of all kinds of industrial machines. Later, due to a lack of knowledge and resources, it turned to the nail-making industry. All of these machines in the factory were transported from famous German factories during the European War. Therefore, after more than ten years of use, they are still able to maintain their current state. All the machines used in the factory's nail-drawing factory are manufactured by the master machine. Recently, the factory has also been engaged in the research and testing of small horsepower gas engines. Although it has been effective, the entire plan has not yet been completed. D. Gas engine. The factory's manufacture of engines has been tested recently. Its fuel is charcoal. The promotion of charcoal cars has been going on for a long time, but the manufacture of fixed engines with charcoal as fuel has not yet been invented. The engine that is currently running is 10 horsepower. Everything is designed and manufactured by the factory, and it is also the first test machine. Each horsepower burns about one catty of charcoal per hour. According to Mr. Huang of the factory, he will conduct further tests in the future to achieve the purpose of being simple, cost-effective, and durable, and then supply it to the society. He is not yet dare to make it public.</p>
<p>(5) Manufacturing Methods of Round Nails and Wire Mesh</p>
<p>The manufacturing methods of round nails and wire mesh are as follows. (A) Round nails (1) Rust removal. The rust removal factory is the most important part of the entire factory. The raw material iron bars are not produced domestically and are all sourced from European and American countries. When they are made into iron bars in the steelmaking plant, they must go through high-temperature rolling. When the iron bars gradually cool down, a hard skin will form on the surface. This hard skin must be removed first during the working process. The method is to immerse the iron bars in dilute acid for about two hours, then pour clear water to wash them clean, and then immerse them in a lime bucket for a few minutes to lubricate the working time. Finally, put them in the drying room to dry them for wire drawing. (2) Wire drawing. The wire-drawing factory uses specially-made steel molds to draw thicker iron bars into thinner iron wires of various sizes to suit the manufactured items. The scope of wire drawing is very wide. It includes all kinds of metal bars that need to be made into wires of standard sizes. The methods are quite different. The factory only draws iron metal. All the machines and accessories used in the workshop are designed and manufactured by the factory itself. Although the effectiveness of this machine is not as good as the latest European and American continuous wire-drawing machines, it has already exceeded the machines used in Japan. The total horsepower required by the entire plant is 230 horsepower. (3) Nail making. The method of machine-made iron nails is very simple. The wires of various sizes are drawn and fitted to nail machines of suitable sizes. The operator extends one end of the iron nail into the machine, and at the same time, the knife and mold in the machine are aligned, and then the machine can be started. The smallest nail can produce 480 pieces per minute, and the largest nail can produce 150 pieces per minute. The factory produces 50,000 pounds of round nails from one-half to six inches every day. Other shoe nails and other nails have a little oil stain and must be polished with a machine to make them smooth and beautiful. Each machine can polish 700 pounds of nails at a time, which takes about 2 hours. A little dry wood chips are placed in the machine during polishing. When the nails are shiny, they are loaded into wooden barrels. Usually, each barrel weighs 100 pounds, and some weigh 130 pounds. This depends on the needs of various places. (B) Wire mesh (1) Barbed wire. There is also a barbed wire machine. This machine is specially made for military barbed wire and is produced by a famous German factory. It is worth more than 7,000 French francs. The machine has been installed for more than a year, and it has not been officially started due to a lack of demand. Ordinary barbed wire is a double-stranded wire with double barbs. The distance between each barb is 4 to 6 inches. Each roll weighs 45 pounds or 56 pounds. The weight can be adjusted on the machine. After one roll is made, the machine will automatically stop. Calculating on an eight-hour day, it can produce 80 rolls. There are only four such machines in China, two in Shanghai, one in the Ministry of Military Affairs, and the other is unknown. (2) Wire fence. Lead wire fence is a by-product of the factory. The weaving work is done by machines. The manufacture of this kind of machine is very simple, but most of the installation work is done manually. The wire fence produced by the factory is made to order and comes with steel wire door mats. The copper wire strands in the center of the door mat are woven by machine, but the frame is made by hand. (C) Machine department. The English term (Machire Shop) machine factory. Originally, it was the manufacture of all kinds of industrial machines. Later, due to a lack of knowledge and resources, it turned to the nail-making industry. All of these machines in the factory were transported from famous German factories during the European War. Therefore, after more than ten years of use, they are still able to maintain their current state. All the machines used in the factory's nail-drawing factory are manufactured by the master machine. Recently, the factory has also been engaged in the research and testing of small horsepower gas engines. Although it has been effective, the entire plan has not yet been completed. (D) Gas engine. The factory's manufacture of engines has been tested recently. Its fuel is charcoal. The promotion of charcoal cars has been going on for a long time, but the manufacture of fixed engines with charcoal as fuel has not yet been invented. The engine that is currently running is 10 horsepower. Everything is designed and manufactured by the factory, and it is also the first test machine. Each horsepower burns about one catty of charcoal per hour. According to Mr. Huang of the factory, he will conduct further tests in the future to achieve the purpose of being simple, cost-effective, and durable, and then supply it to the society.

<h3>Western League Group A Match: 4,000 Fans Grieved as if Bereaved - Tung Wah Loses to Portugal</h3>
<p>Jia Youliang the Bravest of the Brave; Colaco a Formidable Opponent; Portuguese Players Nimble and Agile; Tung Wah's First Defeat with a Score of 3-5</p>
<p>The Tung Wah football team, since the beginning of this season, has won three games in a row with great momentum. Yesterday, they met the Portuguese team at the Shen Garden field but were unfortunately outmaneuvered and defeated with a score of 3-5. The 4,000 fans, who usually support Tung Wah, cheered them on yesterday, but felt powerless. As they left the field, each one was dejected and dispirited. Looking at yesterday's game, the Portuguese players were all small and agile, running quickly. Their forwards were especially sharp and unparalleled. Although Tung Wah had Li and Guan guarding the fortress, it felt impossible to defend. Xu Heng also did not perform well, and the midfield line was weak, often with oversights. Only Jia Youliang ran all over the field with great effort. Sun Jinshun and Li Yichen's movements were sluggish, a difficult problem to overcome. Zhang Jinhai made repeated mistakes. The entire team's formation was loose and lacked vitality.</p>
<p>Fierce Battle Begins</p>
<p>The Portuguese team attacked first, and Tung Wah was forced to a corner kick. Endaye kicked it perfectly, but fortunately, Xu Heng blocked it. The ball went to the middle, where Costain intercepted it and shot fiercely. Li Ning tried to head it but unfortunately missed. Rochery was quick and kicked it diagonally into the net. Xu Heng could not save it. Tung Wah lost the first goal. In the center kickoff, Ade received a beautiful and quick pass from Jia Youliang and shot towards the corner of the net, but unfortunately, it went wide. Soon after, the five forwards launched a joint attack. Li Yichen fought hard in front of the opponent's goal and was injured for a moment before recovering. At that time, the ball often hovered in front of the Portuguese team's goal. Victor was anxious to save the day and touched the ball with his hand. A free kick was awarded at the 20-yard mark. The "Iron Leg" shot from a long distance but missed. The ball was five or six yards from the goal, and Gonsanfu committed a handball, resulting in a penalty kick. Sun "Iron Leg" tried again, but the ball was caught by the goalkeeper. He missed a good opportunity in vain. Jia Youliang advanced from the flank and was hooked out by Victor. Sun passed it two or three times, reaching the opponent's fort again. Dai shot it into the net, but it was ruled offside. After five minutes of stalemate, Ade received a pass, saw the opponent's goal empty, dribbled a few steps, and shot into the corner of the net, creating a 1-1 tie. Subsequently, the Portuguese team launched an active counterattack but did not succeed. Dai and Li returned, but the opponent's defense was strong, creating only two corner kick opportunities. Li Yichen's kick was too far behind. Feng Yunyou headed it fiercely, but it was saved. The Portuguese team then penetrated Tung Wah's rear camp from the center line. Ding Costain calmly dribbled and poked it into the net. Tung Wah lost another goal. The Portuguese forwards' offensive continued to be strong. Li Ning fouled while blocking the ball and was penalized with a free kick. Xu Heng caught the shot and kicked it out, ultimately avoiding a direct hit. The two sides then took a lemon break and switched formations to fight again. Tung Wah attacked wave after wave. Once, Zhang Jinhai dribbled deep, and Ge believed he could definitely score, but his foot slowed down, and the ball was snatched away by the enemy. Zhang Jinhai himself miscalculated and eagerly thought of atoning for his mistake. He dribbled forward again and shot successfully, making it 2-2. Soon after, Jia Youliang ran like the wind, grabbed the ball, and passed it to Ade. Ade's foot was agile, and he took the opportunity to kick it in, reversing the lead. The fans were overjoyed, and the cheers shook the stadium. Unfortunately, good times don't last, and bad luck descended. "Iron Leg" became "Southern Leg" and had to leave the field for a massage. Seeing that Tung Wah's main player was injured, the Portuguese team had an opportunity to take advantage of. Colaco launched an attack from the center and tied the score at 3-3. Tung Wah was determined to win and attacked every move. Zhang Jinhai dribbled the ball in the center, and Li Yichen missed a good chance. Sun Jinshun attacked again, but his foot was too heavy and kicked the ball far away. Tung Wah missed many good opportunities and was heavily pressed by the Portuguese team. Colaco was quick and scored another goal. Finally, Rochery had another opportunity to shoot and succeeded. The Tung Wah team lost 3-5, breaking their undefeated honor in the Western League.</p>

At the time, the weather was cloudy and rainy, but the athletes did not shrink back at all and strived to compete. There were a total of three preliminary rounds and finals, and the results were still very good. The competition continued at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. Because the sky had cleared and the sun was warm, all the athletes on the field were energetic, and the events were all finals, so the competition was even more intense, and the sprinting and competition were very exciting. For example, Ding Guimei's discus achieved a score of 27.95 meters, setting a new school record and breaking her own standard of 24 meters set in the National Games this year, which is commendable. The coaches of this session personally supervised the training every morning, so the results of each item were very good.

After the meeting, Chen Rongming, the pillar of the school's basketball team, demonstrated javelin throwing, reaching 32.19 meters, breaking the national record, which was very exciting. According to the previous National Games, Chen won the javelin first place. This session, because she returned to her province to see her sick mother, she lacked practice beforehand and devoted her efforts to basketball, so she did not participate.

When we enter the hall, we are sad and cover our sleeves to sob. Thinking of Mr. Wu's life, we pick up our pens to describe him. Mr. Wu's inner conduct is pure and full of filial piety. His son's duties were fulfilled from childhood, and his family teachings were strict in his youth. Observing Mr. Wu's entry into the world, we know that he is public and selfless. He avoids rights as if they were defiled and is willing to fulfill his obligations as if they were bestowed upon him. We admire Mr. Wu's acceptance of fate, and he does not change in poverty. He has not eaten since the sun rose, and he has no clothes when the year is old. We admire Mr. Wu's perseverance, and there are no dangers on the righteous road. If it is beneficial to society, he will destroy his family without hesitation. Examining Mr. Wu's scholarship, every action is grand and meticulous. He devoted his life's energy to research that surpassed the subtle. Summarizing his noble deeds, it is understood by the people of the country. We are limited in hearing and seeing and are ashamed of our inability to praise him. The creation of our school was during the founding of the Republic of China. With Mr. Wu's ambition, it began to be firm and unshakeable. Mr. Wu's teaching is just and not divergent. Morality is rooted in ancient teachings, and knowledge is based on new opportunities. Regardless of ignorance or talent, he is always happy to explain and enlighten. People are ashamed of losing their education, and those who enter the school follow each other. Without Mr. Wu's hard work, how could this grand scale be developed? We are fortunate in our private hearts to see the towering mountains, but how could the two spirits rage, causing the great building to lose its support? Reporting the spirit of the horse is useless, and the transformation into a crane is already late. Although the clear light is eternally closed, fortunately, the good teachings will last forever. Let the teacher's model be revealed in the sun and moon and last for eternity. Alas, may you rest in peace!"</p>

<p>"No, Mrs. Jo," he answered softly.</p>
<p>"Do you still use that method now?"</p>
<p>"No, Mrs. Jo," he said even softer than before.</p>

<h3>Foreign Exchange Issues After Currency Management</h3>
<p>— Tan Bingwen</p>
<p>Currency management was rarely heard of before the war. During the European war, it was compelled by practical needs, and almost everyone implemented this system. After the war, although everyone tried their best to restore the old system, the Great Depression of 1929 broke out, followed by trade wars and exchange wars, and countries once again moved towards this path. The motivation for our country's currency management originated after the United States implemented the silver policy in 1933. The silver policy greatly disrupted our market. At that time, there were many proposals to stop the exchange of paper money, concentrate silver, and implement the paper money standard. On the 4th of this month, the Ministry of Finance explicitly ordered the implementation of currency management. At this point, the currency issue came to an end, and the stability of foreign exchange and prices became the focus of attention.</p>
<p>Before discussing the stabilization of foreign exchange, is it necessary to stabilize China's foreign exchange? Generally speaking, currency management focuses on the stability of prices, and foreign exchange is secondary. As Norman Lombard said in his book "Monetary Statesmanship" (1934 N.Y.), the definition of currency management is: "Currency managers control the quantity and circulation speed of currency - which he calls Volumocity - to stabilize its purchasing power." The so-called purchasing power of currency has external and internal distinctions; the former is expressed by the exchange rate, and the latter is expressed by the price level. He said that only importers and exporters and international investors have a close relationship with foreign exchange, which is not important in the entire national economic structure. As for internal purchasing power - prices - this is not the case. Even the Sanjia Village in remote rural areas, all those who hold currency and want to exchange it for goods, have their fortunes tied to it. This is the case in theory and in practice. After Japan abandoned the gold standard in 1931, it once allowed the exchange rate to rise and fall naturally. However, if the exchange rate fluctuates excessively, it is not only easy to cause capital flight, but also makes trade relations deteriorate. Therefore, Japan finally stipulated the "Foreign Exchange Management Law" on March 29, Showa 8, to implement foreign exchange stability. (My article on the impact of the fall in the Japanese exchange rate is published in the Commercial Monthly, Volume 15, No. 2) The United Kingdom was also the same at the beginning of abandoning the gold standard, and it stabilized in the following year. Lessons from the past can be learned. We should seek foreign exchange stability at this time. The stabilization of foreign exchange cannot be achieved by a single decree. The means of stabilization. Books on exchange rates talk about it in detail, but I think there are only two types that can be adopted, namely, the establishment of an exchange rate stabilization fund and Pegging.</p>
<p>Among the countries that have established exchange rate stabilization funds, there are the United States (20 billion yuan) and the United Kingdom (350 million pounds). After abandoning the gold standard, the United Kingdom and the United States tried to establish exchange rate funds, and the result was foreign exchange stability and improved trade relations. However, there are various difficulties in using this system: First, it requires huge amounts of capital. For example, the United Kingdom initially set up 150 million pounds in early April 1932, and increased its capital to 350 million pounds in May 1933. Its amount often increases due to the intensification of international exchange rate wars. How much fund does our country need to stabilize foreign exchange? Although it is not easy to estimate at one time, it is very obvious that the number is large. At this time of people's poverty and financial exhaustion, where does this huge amount come from? (International borrowing is not easy to achieve at one time!) Second, the result of the use of the balance fund may be a loss. The United Kingdom is an example. Even the "Threadneedle Street" financiers with skilled financial techniques still lose tens of millions of pounds or more every year, which is criticized by scholars. Considering the situation in our country, the difficulties are more common. Therefore, there is a full borrowing to maintain the exchange rate in pounds. Those who say that the equalization fund system is feasible have not considered this.</p>
<p>The only method that is more "beneficial without being costly" is Pegging. There are many ways of Pegging. Here, I will talk about the simplest one. First, negotiate a weekly fixed exchange rate, and the domestic government signs a contract with foreign banks or banking groups to buy and sell domestic drafts to prevent fluctuations in the exchange rate. At the same time, the domestic central bank also makes the same purchases and sales at home and abroad. When there is insufficient foreign exchange, it can issue drafts to the contracting bank. There is no need for large-scale capital transfer between each other. Only interest is paid during a certain period. During the European War, the pound and franc fluctuated, so a contract was signed with the American bank Morgan Company (M.J. MorganandCo.) to carry out the above business, which achieved great results. I believe that if our country implements this method at present, it can not only avoid the trouble of borrowing, but also reduce costs, which is more desirable.</p>
<p>Determining the point that foreign exchange should be stabilized is also an urgent matter. To determine this issue, it is necessary to consider trade, debt, and price aspects. The 1932 British expert conference determined the exchange rate in three ways:</p>
<p>(A) Analyze the ratio of changes in foreign prices to domestic prices. Convert domestic prices into foreign currency and compare them with foreign goods. If the value of foreign goods is still lower, then appropriately reduce the domestic exchange rate. This is to prevent foreign goods from seizing the domestic market by dumping through exchange rates.</p>
<p>(B) Analyze the changing trends of raw materials and manufactured goods in domestic foreign trade. A drop in foreign exchange rates and obstruction of import trade is not necessarily beneficial to the country. In a certain range, all countries need to import goods from other countries, and raw materials are especially indispensable.</p>
<p>(C) Analyze the domestic foreign debt situation. Including foreign debt. Domestic people's deposits and investments in foreign countries.</p>
<p>Although our country's national conditions are very different from those of the United Kingdom, the 1932 event can be used as experience when determining the exchange rate.</p>
<p>As for the degree of stability, judging from the recent situation, the exchange rate of our country's currency against foreign exchange seems to be stabilizing at one shilling, two pence, and five cents. However, this is only a temporary phenomenon. This stability level is still too high. Song Ziwen said in the film: "Some people are accustomed to the high-value currency of China in recent years, or believe that the current currency level is low, but what should be noted is that the exchange rate determined this time is actually the average foreign exchange rate from 1930 to 1934 for five years." - Shen Bao on the 5th. According to the average British exchange rate in 1930 was one shilling, two pence, and 789 thousandths of a penny, one shilling and four thousandths of a penny in 1931, one shilling, two pence, and 766 thousandths of a penny in 1932, one shilling, two pence, and 824 thousandths of a penny in 1933, and one shilling and four pence and one cent in 1934. The arithmetic average is one shilling, two pence, and 096 thousandths of a penny, which is very close to the current fixed exchange rate of one shilling, two pence, and five cents. However, is it beneficial to stabilize at this point? This cannot help but make people doubt. The overvalue of Chinese currency has been generally recognized. Gu Chunfan once cleared up in a certain issue of Finauve and Commerce: The currencies of the countries belonging to the sterling group - including Japan and India - have depreciated by 50-60% compared to before the United Kingdom abandoned the gold standard. Therefore, Gu believes that China's foreign exchange should also be lowered by the same degree to adjust. When Gu wrote his article, the British exchange rate was about one shilling and 56 pence. If it is depreciated, it should be about eight pence. Regarding this point, Yao Qingsan also said: "The current exchange rate seems to be too high and must be lowered somewhat in order to increase prices and revive the economy. I have previously suggested lowering the exchange rate of the national currency to the exchange rate before the United Kingdom abandoned the gold standard in 1931, that is, one yuan is approximately equal to one shilling." (Social Economics Monthly, Volume 2, Issue 9, Page 3.) From this point of view, the current exchange rate is not only not low, but also too high. Fortunately, paper money has been stopped for exchange, and the Ministry of Finance has also given the central bank and others the authority to buy and sell foreign exchange without restriction, and everything can be gradually improved.</p>
<p>On the foreign exchange side, the main argument focuses on theory, while the crux of the price issue lies in technology. The current price changes. Although it is said to be a temporary and abnormal phenomenon. It will soon return to its old appearance. However, the easiest problem to commit in currency management is the indiscriminate issuance of paper money, because under the paper money standard, government bonds and paper money are in fact one and two, and two and one. If the finances are unbalanced, government bonds will be issued, and the Printing Machine will step up its work - this is what all countries are accustomed to experiencing and there is no need to shy away from. Although the Minister of Finance said that the finances can be balanced within eighteen months, this still needs to be proven by facts. According to the Ministry of Finance's archives, the fiscal deficit was 21.7 million yuan in the 19th year, 13 million yuan in the 20th year, 8.6 million yuan in the 21st year, and increased to 14.7 million yuan in the 22nd year. In this autumn of increasing foreign troubles, it is feared that the budget balance is difficult to achieve. The above points are indeed worries. If we can increase revenue and reduce expenditure, there is no reason for the budget to be unbalanced. However, in addition to this, prices can still change due to various factors, because prices under the paper money standard are very sensitive, which is also recognized by everyone. To prevent excessive price fluctuations, a strict and accurate price index must be established. As the basis for the central bank to expand and contract the market currency. The rise of the statistics industry in our country has only been for more than ten years. Up to now, there are only a few places that compile and publish price indexes on a regular basis: (1) The National Tariff Commission compiles the Shanghai wholesale price index, import and export price index, and cost of living index; (2) The School of Economics of Nankai University compiles the North China wholesale price index; (3) The Guangdong Provincial Survey and Statistics Bureau compiles the Guangzhou wholesale price index; (4) The Statistics Director's Office of the Ministry of Industry compiles the wholesale price indexes of Nanjing, Qingdao, and Hankou; (5) The Hunan Provincial Department of Finance compiles the Changsha wholesale price index. The agencies that compiled the above indexes are different. The methods adopted cannot be consistent, and the results should not be compared simply. Under the currency management movement, we need a unified national price index. How to improve and summarize the above indexes into a national price index seems to be an urgent matter.</p>
<p>Stabilizing prices is to stabilize the internal purchasing power of currency. However, ordinary price indexes cannot really represent the purchasing power of currency. Therefore, John Maynard Keynes once sighed and said: "There is no price index that can truly represent the purchasing power of currency!" - TreatiseonMoney. Some argue that the cost of living index has better representation, and others weight and average various indexes to form a Mixed Index, saying that it is more representative. The latter's venue is like the Dun's Index in the United States. Our country does not even have a unified price index. Taking this opportunity to convene a meeting of statistical experts to establish a representative price index will not only be a blessing for China's economy, but also add luster to the history of statistics.</p>
<p>After obtaining a representative price index, it is still necessary to determine the price stabilization point, just like foreign exchange has a stabilization point. The pursuit of the stabilization point can also be based on the average price over the past few years, similar to the method of foreign exchange. I have previously advocated using the period from the 15th to the 18th years of the Republic of China as the benchmark, and the main reasons are: (1) the political situation is relatively stable, (2) there are no special events, (3) the development of industry and commerce is normal, and the link between the urban economy and the rural economy has not yet collapsed. - Money Industry Monthly, Volume 15, Issue 5, "On Currency Management in Our Country." Questioning the experts, is there anything appropriate?</p>
<p>Currency management does not necessarily require inflating the currency. The best example is that the amount of currency did not increase at all after the United Kingdom abandoned the gold standard in 1931. China currently does not need to inflate the currency temporarily, because inflating the currency only increases new purchasing power by artificial means. Although it can stimulate industry, it is not a blessing for the common people. However, since the currency is managed, the difference between the external purchasing power and the internal purchasing power of the currency can be manipulated to improve trade prices and revive the economy. A slight increase in prices and a slight depreciation of the exchange rate are what we have hoped for in the past. However, there are three forms: (1) If the domestic purchasing power - the price increase - is equal to the depreciation of the foreign purchasing power - the exchange rate - trade will still not be affected; (2) If the degree of increase in domestic purchasing power is greater than the degree of depreciation of foreign exchange, exports will be suppressed and imports will be promoted; (3) If the degree of increase in domestic purchasing power is less than the degree of depreciation of foreign exchange, imports will be obstructed and exports will be improved. Among the three, which is beneficial and which is unfavorable varies from country to country. What policy should China adopt is obvious, and there is no need for people to say more. - November 8, just recovered from illness.</p>
<h3>The Issue of Commodity Prices Under the New Monetary Policy</h3>
<p>— He Boxiong</p>
<p>(1) Conclusion</p>
<p>To alleviate the current economic crisis in our country, the Ministry of Finance resolutely adopted a decisive measure. Drawing on precedents from various countries, it announced an emergency decree. Starting from the 4th of this month, it implemented a new currency law, stipulating that banknotes issued by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications would be legal tender. All payments for grain taxes and all public and private items would be limited to legal tender, prohibiting the use of cash. Violators would have their assets confiscated to prevent the outflow of silver. Furthermore, a committee for the management of issuance reserves was established to handle the custody of legal tender reserves and the issuance and exchange of legal tender. The Central Bank was also reorganized into the Central Reserve Bank to centralize reserves, and the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications would engage in unlimited buying and selling of foreign exchange to stabilize the exchange market. This decisive measure is truly an unprecedented new era in the history of our country's currency, and it can also be said to be a great success in the currency system reform following the National Revolution. It has an immeasurable impact on the recovery of the national economy. In recent years, our country's national economy has suffered from the destruction and oppression of imperialist powers. Not only has it been unable to develop, but it has also become increasingly dilapidated. Since the global economic panic intensified in recent years, major countries have successively revised their monetary policies, prohibiting the circulation of hard currency. Our country, which uses silver as currency, has been greatly affected since the price of silver fluctuated drastically, leading to a significant phenomenon of domestic currency contraction. As a result, industry and commerce have declined, all businesses have languished, capital has flowed out, and the balance of international payments has fallen into an unfavorable state. If this continues, economic collapse will lead to unimaginable consequences. Now, the Ministry of Finance has implemented this monetary policy to seek permanent stability for currency and finance. However, since the announcement of the new currency law on the 4th, commodity prices in various regions have seen a sharp increase. However, at present, the purchasing power of our country's citizens has not yet recovered. If commodity prices are raised excessively, not only will national industries be unable to adjust step by step and develop normally, but the majority of low-wage workers will inevitably fall into greater difficulties due to rising prices. How can the lives of ordinary people be mentioned! This article aims to explain the causes and effects of the sharp rise in commodity prices, as well as countermeasures to stabilize them. I hope to discuss this with the people of the country.</p>
<p>(2) What Constitutes the Increase in Commodity Prices?</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the new monetary policy, it is undeniable that commodity prices have generally increased over the past ten days. After examining the reasons, they are nothing more than the following, which are explained separately below.</p>
<p>(A) Due to Public Anxiety</p>
<p>After the declaration of the Ministry of Finance was published, the market and the public were shocked and uneasy. Coupled with the manipulation of speculators and the creation of rumors, commodity prices were raised. Taking the situation on that day as an example, when the yarn cloth exchange opened, commodity prices soared wildly, with no end in sight. The price of labeled yarn rose sharply by six, seven, or even ten yuan at the opening in the morning. The six-month term all broke through the 200 yuan mark, and the twelve-month term rose to a maximum of 104 yuan. Compared with the market situation on July 12 of this year, the recent month's yarn was as low as 158 yuan and 9 jiao. In just three and a half months, the difference between high and low was 45 yuan and 1 jiao. Cotton also rose sharply by three yuan at the opening. The two-month term peaked at 43 yuan. Recalling the market situation on June 8 of this year, the recent flower was once as low as around 30 yuan. In less than four months, the difference between high and low was 13 yuan. Other daily necessities, such as rice, also suddenly rose by one or two yuan, bean oil rose by more than one yuan, and sesame seeds, soybeans, raw peanuts, flour, wheat, and seafood, raw silk, red and green tea, hardware, etc. among groceries all saw sharp increases (see "Weekly Price Changes" in the commercial news column of the Shenbao on the 11th). Now, the Ministry of Finance is not implementing currency inflation, but the market situation is so chaotic, and ordinary people are losing innocently. This is due to public anxiety, coupled with speculators manipulating and monopolizing the market.</p>
<p>(B) The Impact of Exchange Rate Decline</p>
<p>The decline in exchange rates is the main reason for the increase in commodity prices. Because the exchange rate is falling, importers reduce imports, and the prices of imported goods are bound to rise. That is, the country's export goods must also raise prices in the domestic market with a monopolistic advantage due to the reduction in the import of foreign goods. This is very obvious. According to the Central Bank's listing, the exchange rate against the British pound was maintained at around one shilling and six pence in the first ten days of last month, and the US dollar was around 37 or 38 yuan. Until after the 15th of last month, the foreign exchange rate plummeted. The British exchange rate fell from one shilling and six pence to five pence, four pence, three pence, and even fell to one shilling and two and a half pence on the 4th of this month. The US exchange rate fell from 37 yuan to 29 yuan, a difference of as much as eight yuan. The same is true for the Japanese, French, and German exchange rates. For the sake of clarity, the foreign exchange rates since the 15th of last month are listed as follows (recorded from the Shenshi Economic Intelligence, daily Central Bank quotations):</p>

<p>(C) Misunderstanding the Currency Law</p>
<p>Most people have not understood the true meaning of the new currency law implemented on the 4th of this month. The headlines in various newspapers even had the words "Abandoning the Silver Standard." Regarding the suspension of cash redemption of banknotes, France has not yet suspended the gold standard, but in fact, there is no circulation or use of gold francs in the domestic market. The same was true in the United Kingdom and the United States before they suspended the gold standard. The Ministry of Finance Order of the 3rd of this month, which replaced hard currency with banknotes from now on, can only be regarded as a condition for stopping the silver standard, not a hasty judgment that the silver standard has been abandoned. This is the first point. Moreover, whether or not banknotes with legal tender status can be redeemed domestically is even more irrelevant to the standard system. For example, from May 13, 1925, to September 20, 1931, under the British gold bullion standard system, Bank of England banknotes were not redeemable domestically, but they were still a gold standard system. In the future, although our country's banknotes are prohibited from being exchanged for silver coins domestically and used in the market, we cannot hastily conclude that the silver standard has been abandoned. This is the second point. (For this point, please refer to Zhao Lanping's article "Abandoning the Silver Standard and Suspending the Silver Standard" in the Zhonghua Daily on the 11th.) Therefore, stopping the use of silver coins is not abandoning the silver standard. In the future, banknote issuance will still follow the precedent of having more than 60% of reserves, and a reserve management committee will be organized, composed of representatives from industrial and commercial banks and the government, and it will be inspected and announced every ten days. The issuance review and supervision are even more strict than in the past. The new monetary policy does not involve the implementation of currency inflation. At present, both the United Kingdom and Japan have suspended the gold standard, but have not abandoned the gold standard. Although the banknotes issued are not redeemable, they still have sufficient specie reserves. The various statements of "abandoning the silver standard" and "currency inflation" published in various newspapers on the 4th of this month are all misunderstandings, leading to soaring commodity prices, fearing losses due to the depreciation of banknotes, which is truly laughable.</p>
<p>In short, the functions of the new monetary policy are: First, to concentrate cash and prevent the outflow of silver. Second, to issue appropriate banknotes with legal reserves to circulate market chips and avoid the aggravation of market credit contraction, so as to invigorate industry and commerce. In the future, commodity prices will naturally have a tendency to gradually recover. As for the current state of soaring commodity prices, the future is very dangerous, and we really need to review it.</p>
<p>(3) The Harm of Soaring Commodity Prices</p>
<p>The reason why the economic society re-emphasizes commodity price fluctuations is that they have a profound impact on people's economic lives. Since the implementation of the new monetary policy, commodity prices have visibly risen in various places. This is undeniable. However, if commodity prices rise sharply in our country's current economic state, which is not conducive to economic recovery, the development of the crisis will be unspeakable. Now, I will describe it separately.</p>
<p>(A) From the perspective of consumers, the most directly affected by the soaring commodity prices are the majority of the common people. When commodity prices had not yet risen, their income was not enough to maintain their lives. If commodities rise sharply in one day, the difficulty of their lives can be imagined. Even in terms of labor, on the one hand, commodity prices tend to rise, and on the other hand, workers' wages are also increased, but in reality, the extent of wage increases is less than the extent of commodity price increases. From this, it can be seen that commodity price increases always precede wage increases. The increase in wages is slower than the increase in commodity prices, and the extent of the former increase is less than the increase in the latter, so workers' lives have to be more and more difficult due to rising prices. Moreover, our country's economy has been exhausted for a long time, and the decline in the purchasing power of the people has been irreparable. The lives of ordinary people are always and everywhere difficult to sustain. For this reason, most ordinary people today have more expenditure than income. How can they talk about their future lives!</p>
<p>(B) From the perspective of industry, today our country's industry has been devastated by the direct and indirect impact of domestic and foreign political and economic factors in recent years. In the future, we need to protect and restore its vitality. What we should pay attention to today is that since commodity prices have risen, the prices of all raw materials will also rise. As a result, production costs will increase. If the price of industrial products exceeds the production cost and rises, producers will benefit from this. However, from an economic point of view, as the price of goods rises, demand will decrease accordingly. The extent of the decrease varies depending on the nature of the goods. However, it can be asserted that demand and price change in inverse proportion. Therefore, even if producers increase the price of industrial products due to increased production costs, if the demand for the industrial product decreases, producers will suffer losses as a result. Secondly, the dumping of foreign low-priced goods can drive domestic high-priced goods out of the market. Again, the increase in production costs due to the increase in production costs will increase the cost of domestic goods. If the price is raised, it will not be able to leave the country. Therefore, a sharp rise in commodity prices that does not conform to the economic reality has the harm of destroying the industry, which is very obvious.</p>
<p>(C) From the perspective of international trade, our country has always been squeezed by the powers, and foreign goods fill the domestic market. Most of the daily necessities of the middle class and above are foreign goods. The number of import surpluses has been huge year after year, resulting in a large surplus in the balance of international payments. This is an obvious fact. In recent years, the decline in foreign exchange and the fall in domestic commodity prices have been enough to limit the sale of some foreign goods. Now, if the foreign exchange rate falls on the one hand, and domestic commodity prices soar on the other hand, the losses suffered by foreign goods from the fall in foreign exchange rates in our country will be compensated by the benefits gained from the soaring domestic commodity prices in our country. As a result, our country can promote the large-scale import of foreign goods due to the soaring commodity prices. This point is very obvious and important. Therefore, the sharp rise in commodity prices in the future can not only increase the import surplus, but also lead to foreign goods seizing the domestic market and destroying our nascent industry.</p>
<p>(4) How to Stabilize Commodity Prices in the Future</p>
<p>The crisis of soaring commodity prices has been briefly described above, so the stability of commodity prices is an urgent task. However, the rise or fall of commodity prices is a relative term. What is the standard for so-called stability? This must be assisted by statistical techniques. CW.cI. King said in his "Statistical Method": "The commodity price index (Index Number of Price) is a statistical expression that compares commodity prices in different periods or different places and calculates the relationship between them by numerical methods." The rise and fall of commodity prices, in other words, is the change in the purchasing power of money. It can be observed from the commodity price index. A rise in the commodity price index is a sign of a decrease in the purchasing power of money. On the contrary, a drop in the commodity price index means that the purchasing power of money is expanding. In statistics, is there no so-called Normal Period? If we carefully examine and find the Normal Prord, we can calculate the benchmark of the commodity price index, then we will regard this benchmark as the ideal point of price stabilization (Point of Staibilization). Since commodity prices have a certain standard, industry can develop in a normal state, which has a profound impact on the prosperity and decline of the national economy. As far as I can see, if we want to suppress the sharp rise in commodity prices in the future and maintain them at a stable point on the right (Note: The formulation of this stable point is the work of our government's statistical agencies and is beyond the scope of this article.), I think the following strategies can be implemented under the current situation in China, and I would like to provide some references for our government authorities.</p>
<p>(A) Strictly Prohibit Profiteering</p>
<p>Merchants or manufacturers who want to seek exorbitant profits and raise market prices, causing ordinary consumers to suffer under the rising prices of goods, must be strictly prohibited, whether in society or in justice. This has already been implemented by local authorities, but it is not appropriate to see only a piece of paper and no effective measures. As for how to severely crack down on unscrupulous merchants, we need to study it. The strict methods of cracking down on profiteering adopted by various countries can be used as a reference and can be divided into two types: First, the government imposes considerable restrictions on those who seek exorbitant profits. This is the "Profiteering Crackdown Order" promulgated by Japan on September 1, 1917. According to the order, "If the government believes that someone is using profiteering or stingy sales as a means to induce rapid market price fluctuations and seek exorbitant profits, the Minister of Agriculture and Commerce will stipulate a certain period of time to warn them that they cannot engage in this behavior. If they violate this warning and engage in profiteering and stingy sales, they will be sentenced to imprisonment of less than three months or a fine of less than 100 yuan." Second, if there are those who seek exorbitant profits, the victims can report them. If it is true, they will be sanctioned. This method is implemented in the United Kingdom. In 1919, the country promulgated the "Profiteering Act": "If someone suffers losses due to a merchant or manufacturer seeking exorbitant profits, they can report it at any time. If the Ministry of Commerce investigates and confirms it, it will be sanctioned. Those who do not comply with the order will be fined less than 50 pounds or imprisoned for less than one month. If they violate it again, they will be fined less than 200 pounds or imprisoned for less than six months." The above two methods are only examples for reference. If our country wants to strictly prohibit the raising of commodity prices and impose sanctions, it is necessary to clearly stipulate regulations and implement them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(B) Adjusting the Currency Supply</p>
<p>A rise in commodity prices is a symbol of the low purchasing power of currency. The countermeasure at this time is to constrain the amount and circulation speed of currency to achieve adjustment. Conversely, if commodity prices fall too much, the purchasing power of money will increase at the same time. The method of adjustment is to increase the amount of currency and the speed of currency circulation, so that commodity prices are close to the base period level. This is the ability to manage the currency supply. The expansion of currency is not a simple increase in currency, but an increase in currency that exceeds the demand for currency. If the amount of currency increases, the demand for currency will also increase at the same rate, so there will be no currency expansion. For example, if China has 500 million yuan of currency, all economic transactions can be carried out smoothly. If the transaction volume increases by 100 million yuan compared with the past, then the currency must be increased by 100 million yuan. This kind of currency increase is definitely not currency inflation, because the general economic sector can digest this amount. If the transaction volume does not increase, and the currency increases simply, then the general economic sector cannot digest this huge amount. As a result, it can cause currency inflation. In other words, the so-called currency inflation generally refers to the fact that the amount of banknotes issued exceeds the necessary amount of currency circulation, which may lead to the danger of unlimited depreciation of banknotes and unlimited increase in commodity prices. For example, in Germany in 1913, the amount of banknotes issued was only 2 billion marks. Due to the currency inflation policy in the years after the war, the amount of banknotes issued reached as much as 80 billion marks in 1921, and the rise in domestic commodity prices and the fall in currency prices created an unprecedented miracle. (In August 1923, a chicken egg in Berlin was worth 55,000 marks, and a pound of tea was worth 1.5 million to 2 million marks.) This kind of harm and the suffering of the people are still talked about today with a pale face, because it is something we should absolutely avoid. However, the current new currency policy in our country aims only to concentrate reserves and unify issuance, and will definitely not issue banknotes indiscriminately like the German government. According to the regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, all matters concerning the custody of legal tender reserves and the issuance of legal tender shall be executed by the Issuance Reserve Management Committee. The committee is organized by government personnel and representatives of domestic banks and money houses, and the committee members should inspect the reserve vault once a month and publicly announce the types and amounts of issuance preparation funds separately. This kind of method is realistic and can often stabilize commodity prices and adjust the currency supply, so that there will be no currency inflation that violates public opinion.</p>
<p>(C) Rediscount Policy</p>
<p>The bill discount system has been implemented for a long time in foreign financial markets, such as London in the United Kingdom, New York in the United States, and Paris in France. With the responsibility of the central bank, applying the discount policy is to control the flow of market cash and regulate financial stability and commodity prices by raising or lowering the rediscount rate. The power it generates is extremely great. The level of the discount rate can have the following effects on commodity prices: (1) Increasing the discount rate can reduce the demand for discounts, which can reduce the issuance of banknotes. If the money supply is small, commodity prices will tend to fall. Conversely, lowering the discount rate will increase the issuance of banknotes, and commodity prices will tend to rise. Therefore, the level of the discount rate can directly adjust the currency supply and indirectly stabilize commodity prices. Now that the strength of our country's central bank has become stable, the issuance is unified, and bill circulation will be promoted, this rediscount policy can be used from now on. (2) When the foreign exchange rate rises too sharply, the discount rate can be increased. If the interest rates on various items in the market are firm, funds from other countries can be attracted and flow in, and the foreign exchange rate will fall. Conversely, if the foreign exchange rate falls too sharply, the central bank will suppress its discount rate, discounted bills from various countries will flow in, and cash will be exported, which will promote the opposite phenomenon. At the same time, domestic exchange rates are based on Shanghai as the standard. Therefore, under this situation, the central bank's discount policy is also an effective means of managing foreign exchange. Although the Ministry of Finance has issued an order stipulating that the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications shall buy and sell foreign exchange without restriction, buying and selling foreign exchange must have strong reserves stored abroad or set up an exchange rate stabilization fund to cope with it. In the future, the three banks will centralize reserves, and a huge amount of cash can be obtained to prepare for buying and selling foreign exchange to stabilize exchange rates, and the implementation of the discount policy cannot be said to be useless for the stability of exchange rates. Although commodity prices and exchange rates are closely related, a high foreign exchange rate is conducive to imports, increases the import surplus, and domestic commodity prices will inevitably tend to fall. A low foreign exchange rate is conducive to exports, reduces the import surplus, and commodity prices will tend to rise. Therefore, the discount policy can directly stabilize foreign exchange and indirectly stabilize commodity prices.</p>
<p>(D) Securities Trading</p>
<p>This is to supplement the shortcomings of the rediscount policy. When there is too much cash in the market, interest rates are low, and commodity prices are rising, the central bank's rediscount policy often loses its effectiveness. At this time, securities can be sold and cash collected to suppress commodity prices. If there is too little cash in the market, interest rates are high, and commodity prices tend to fall, the central bank can buy securities and release cash to raise commodity prices. Our country's stock market is still in its infancy, but our country's bond market has been deeply rooted. The so-called application of this kind of OpehMarketPolicy has not been seen before. It is not that it cannot be done, but that it has not been done.</p>
<p>(E) Official Commodity Prices</p>
<p>Among the official price systems, the French system is the model, and many countries have imitated it. The central agency of this system is the commodity price official committee organized in each place, which investigates the prices of important life necessities in the place and publishes them as fair and reasonable regulations. The Shenbao on the 6th of this month reported that Nanjing was the first to have a similar price evaluation committee organization with an official price system. What was reported was that "The city's price evaluation committee was established today by the Social Affairs Bureau's convening organization. In the future, the work will be to thoroughly investigate the prices of daily necessities on the one hand and to prohibit manipulation and raising prices at any time on the other hand. The municipal government will cooperate with various agencies to carry out the work, and so on." The organization of this price evaluation committee has the spirit of an official price system and restricts the activities of profiteers. This measure is indeed beneficial to the people's livelihood, and it is hoped that local authorities will continue to organize it.</p>
<p>In the future, I think the trend of commodity prices can be gradually increased by the recovery of the economy. However, what is most worrying is the unreasonable and expensive commodity prices in the future. If this continues, its harm will be very great. Therefore, how to stabilize commodity prices in the future is the most urgent task today. The few points listed by the author are very superficial, but the purpose is to attract jade by throwing bricks. I hope that those who plan for our country will benefit from it.

<h3>Securities - Bonds in a Frenzied Rise</h3>
<p>—The Gains of the No. 22 Bonds Were Exceptionally Large—</p>
<p>Last week (November 18th to 23rd) at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange was the final week for the November futures and also one of the most intense weeks of frenzied price increases. From a political perspective, although North China may have temporarily achieved a precarious peace, its ambitions have not diminished, and future changes are difficult to predict. From a monetary perspective, bonds and paper money are of the same nature, except that one is in whole numbers and the other in fractional amounts. However, if there is a shortage of fractional currency on the market, these whole-number units (bonds) can be taken in by the bank and paper money issued. Conversely, bonds can be sold to withdraw paper money, to adjust the level of interest rates. Consequently, there is talk in the market of all bonds being settled and redeemed. However, with internal debt amounting to hundreds of millions, coupled with local government bonds, it is more than double that amount, so redeeming them all in full may not be easy. However, some major merchants advocate redeeming old high-interest bonds to lower market interest rates, so this talk is not without reason. However, legal tender still requires a 60% cash reserve, so issuance must be limited. Issuing new bonds to consolidate old prices also feels cumbersome. Therefore, the talk of redemption does not seem achievable in the short term. During the No. 23 bonds crisis in the spring, the amount in circulation was only about ten to twenty million. The talk of redeeming them all nearly became a certainty at the time, causing them to plummet by more than thirty yuan, which serves as a reference. Even looking at the instruments for this month, this settlement involves around one hundred million yuan, also setting a previously unseen record high. Therefore, the exchange has issued a notice that the settlement originally scheduled for the 28th will now be halted on the 27th to prepare for the settlement. Today is the last day for the November futures, and it has been decided that three rounds of trading will definitely be done. Market price fluctuations are sure to reveal more surprises. The past week was spent almost entirely under a cloud of price increases. On Monday, due to the separatist movement in North China, the "Northern Faction" and Nos. 47, 48, and 69, etc., sold off, and market prices fell slightly, by a few dimes to about one yuan. Tuesday was entirely an artificial buying frenzy, with three consecutive rounds of price increases. In the last round, the final distant full six, at all costs, was driven up to beyond four yuan before hitting the limit. On Wednesday, initially, as usual, it eased back a few dimes to more than one and a half yuan. Then, it was pulled up again, to prevent a sharp decline. As a result, it still rose a few dimes to one yuan. On Thursday, rumors of an 8% monthly interest rate were rife. The situation in North China suddenly turned toward reconciliation, and retail investors rushed to cover their short positions even more fiercely, with six types of bonds hitting the limit again, reaching consistently new high prices. The discount was already above 80%, and the monthly interest rate was only about five or six percent. On Friday, the buyers slightly paused, as their main entities had already emerged one after another, gradually shifting the blame to those who blindly followed the trend. Although market prices saw a slight pullback of a few dimes to one yuan, "Reorganization and Demobilization" and No. 96 bonds still rose a few dimes to one yuan and three dimes and a half. On Saturday, the buying power weakened and gradually became exposed, and the price support was no longer from the main entities, but from those who merely echoed the trend, creating a situation where they were stuck in a difficult position, only able to make their last desperate struggle. Therefore, although most were pushed up by a few dimes to one yuan and seven dimes and a half, "Reorganization and Demobilization" and No. 20 bonds still fell slightly by a few dimes to one yuan and two dimes. Throughout the week, the situation was clear, with retail investors holding long positions being particularly crowded and dangerous, especially those concentrated in No. 22 bonds, which felt even more terrifying. Looking at its market price, which has already reached parity with No. 23 bonds, is it not obvious? As a result of the week's market prices, No. 22 bonds alone experienced a frenzied rise of as much as eight yuan and nine dimes and a half, showing the point of concentration of long positions. The next highest was "Full Six," which rose eight yuan and a half, drawing attention. The rest mostly rose around six yuan. The total volume traded was as high as 236,183,000 yuan, setting a new record for weekly performance. The results of the gains and losses are compared and listed on the left:</p>

<h3>Finance - Large Fluctuations in the Market for Dime Coins</h3>
<p>This week, dime coins saw significant fluctuations. The highest was 11 dimes and 1.5 cents, and the lowest was 12 dimes and 0.6 cents, a difference of almost one dime. Yesterday's market conditions were slightly higher again, with the opening price at 12 dimes and 0.1 cents and the afternoon price at 12 dimes and 0.2 cents. Only 40,000 dimes were traded in the morning and 5,000 dimes in the afternoon. Copper coins remained at 3,000 cash, with 34,500 strings of cash traded, equivalent to 11,500 silver dollars.</p>

<p>Total 114,537 bags. In addition, there are 5,700 bags remaining at the West Taikoo Warehouse.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn - Quiet Trading in the Overseas Cotton Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the opening of American cotton was sluggish. Prices for each month rose by 3 pounds to fall by 6 pounds. Afterwards, old cotton long positions were closed, and new cotton short positions were covered, causing the market situation to become uncertain. The December contract, due to Monday being the delivery notice day, saw many long positions being closed, with few new trades, so the trend was particularly soft. The situation in the market seemed to be adjusting the price difference between near and far months. The director of the Cotton Storage Office, Johnston, stated today that the reopening date of the Farmers' Cotton Storage Office could only be discussed after the December ginning report was released. The final closing of long positions started again, but the closing was still stable. As a result, the spot price rose by 5 pounds, futures fell by 1 to 3 pounds, and the distant month rose by 4 pounds. English cotton spot fell by 2 points, and futures fell by 3 points. Indian cotton was dumped by European exporters, and operators sold in large quantities, but it was absorbed by public buying. As calculated, Pingguo'er fell by 3.75 to 5 rupees, Aomula fell by 3.5 to 3.75 rupees, and Bairuoxi fell by 3.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 23rd):</p>

<h3>Grain - Slow Sales of River Rice Remain</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 30 numbers from various sources along the river, mostly thin indica rice, with some adulteration still present. However, local sales were flat. Throughout the day, Tianjin, Qingdao and other districts continued to handle 3-4 thousand bags, so the market was slightly buoyant. The sales of thick early japonica rice in urban and rural areas have slackened, and the market showed a tired sentiment within stability. Du Yangjian rice is still firm due to its scarcity, while Yinyuan rice is oversupplied, with a slight price decrease.</p>

<h3>Understanding Early-Stage Pulmonary Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— Shen Xiangbo</p>
<p>When you realize that you have tuberculosis, it is no longer the early stage. In other words, your tuberculosis is already quite advanced! So, what exactly is considered early-stage tuberculosis? This article will provide you with a complete answer.</p>
<p>The common cold seems to be a common occurrence, and Chinese people have never paid much attention to it. However, this small ailment that is often overlooked is the precursor to various respiratory diseases, and it has a particularly close relationship with early-stage pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>
<p>The tuberculosis bacterium is a curious thing. Its mode of infection is fundamentally different from that of other infectious bacteria. Common infectious diseases usually have common characteristics, such as fever and increased white blood cells. These symptoms are very obvious and have a clear difference from healthy people, so they easily attract the attention of the sufferers. As for the tuberculosis bacterium? It is very cunning. It does not need to launch a fierce attack on the human body, causing our body to develop a high fever to resist it, and it does not bother to alarm the white blood cell warriors to organize their troops and fiercely attack it head-on. Just when you have a cold and are not paying attention, it mixes with the crowd and quietly slips into your respiratory organs and begins its spread.</p>
<p>At first, it is very cunning, almost completely imitating how Mr. Cold treats you, so that you only feel that you still have a cold and never think that you are already in the early stages of pulmonary tuberculosis. However, its true face can be seen through with a discerning eye. How to expose its deception, you will understand the following few thresholds!</p>
<p>(1) A cold that has lasted for nearly a month and still has not healed.</p>
<p>(2) Physical weakness. Very easily fatigued.</p>
<p>(3) Gradual weight loss.</p>
<p>(4) Night sweats. Occasional mild cough, but without phlegm.</p>
<p>(5) Loss of appetite, poor digestion.</p>
<p>(6) Slight fever in the afternoon, flushed face. (Commonly known as "liver fire")</p>
<p>(7) Hoarse voice. (Commonly known as "loss of voice")</p>
<p>(8) Having had one or two instances of hemoptysis (coughing up blood). (Although extremely mild, it is very serious).</p>
<p>The above eight points are all symptoms of patients with early-stage pulmonary tuberculosis. However, not every patient has all of the above symptoms. However, when you check yourself and find that you have any four or more of the above symptoms, you must go to a doctor to diagnose whether you have pulmonary tuberculosis; (according to the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis, it must rely on experienced lung disease experts to examine). If not, that is your good fortune. If you do, you must treat it as soon as possible. There is a 100% hope of curing it in this early stage.</p>
<p>Why do we need to recognize early-stage pulmonary tuberculosis?</p>
<p>(1) The symptoms of the early stage are very mild and have no extremely obvious characteristics, so they are easily overlooked. (2) Early-stage pulmonary tuberculosis is the easiest to cure.</p>
<p>Originally, treating tuberculosis only when it reaches the early stage is already considered late. The most important thing, of course, is still preventing tuberculosis. However, if the tuberculosis bacterium has already broken through your first line of defense against tuberculosis and entered the early stage, you must try to kill it as early as possible, so that it cannot break through the second line of defense and reach the second stage of tuberculosis. If you relax your guard during that critical early stage, you will later have to become its prisoner.</p>
<p>Editor's note: If you have discovered that you have early-stage pulmonary tuberculosis, or if your body is weak and you often catch colds (i.e., catch a cold), and you have a tendency to develop pulmonary tuberculosis, you should treat and prevent it as early as possible. The most appropriate method is to implement hygienic therapies such as air nutrition, and at the same time take "Fei Huo" (PhithWeal). This medicine is an effective agent for "treating tuberculosis for those who have it—improving health and preventing tuberculosis for those who do not have it." If you can actively implement the above various therapies, you can restore your health and never have to worry about lung disease!</p>
<h3>Effective Treatment for Asthma</h3>
<p>— Physician Jiang Guanqun</p>
<p>Asthma has been difficult to cure since ancient times. Although it has gradually improved today, it has not yet reached the pinnacle. Scholars still need to climb step by step. According to the occurrence of this disease, it often starts in childhood. In its early stages, it is susceptible to wind and cold, often developing into nasal mucosal inflammation and diffuse tracheobronchitis, with symptoms such as wheezing and difficulty breathing. Over time, it develops into fixed asthma. Such children are often thin and slender, and their chest development is not very good. However, the chronic disease of asthma often disappears as they reach maturity around the age of 10. Those who do not recover beyond this point will suffer from an incurable disease for the rest of their lives. There are also cases of asthma starting in old age, around the ages of forty and fifty, which will accumulate and persist for the rest of their lives. However, this example is not common. The main symptom is a high degree of difficulty breathing. Its onset is usually sudden at night. Breathing is obstructed and difficult, and one cannot lie down, but must sit or stand to ease their breathing. The face is pale or cyanotic. The frequency of attacks varies, and the duration also varies. Some have several attacks a week, while others have only one or two attacks a year or two. Some recover in one or two hours, while others recover after a night or several days. Some even suffer from the distress of difficulty breathing for several weeks. Treatment is divided into two types: (1) treating the distress of the current attack; (2) preventing future attacks. Between asthma attacks, sedatives and anesthetics can generally be used to relieve the symptoms. Chloral (1-0), Morphine (0-01), and Opium (0.03) are all sufficient to take effect. However, the repeated use of such anesthetics may lead to addiction, and should not be used lightly unless the difficulty breathing is so severe that the suffering is unbearable. Recently, physicians have often tried using "Fei Huo" (PhithWeal) with rapid results and no drawbacks such as addiction. Moreover, its phlegm-dissolving effect is very significant. It is especially suitable for those who cough up thick, purulent phlegm that is difficult to expectorate. After taking it, the phlegm will immediately turn into a watery liquid and be coughed up, and breathing will be smooth immediately. The prevention of asthma focuses on removing the cause. Those with nasal diseases must treat them. Also, prolonged use of "Fei Huo" (PhithWeal) (approximately three consecutive months) has resulted in many recoveries. If the disease is stubborn, a 3% Calcium Chloride solution can be used for intravenous injection. Once a day, 20 cc each time, injected up to seventy or eighty times, can have remarkable effects.</p>
<h3>Causes and Treatment of Chronic Cough (Chronic Bronchitis)</h3>
<p>— Physician Jiang Guanqun</p>
<p>Chronic Bronchitis is caused by repeated attacks of acute bronchitis (mostly from colds) that linger and do not heal. Those who are old and those who often work in polluted and unclean air often suffer from this disease.</p>
<p>The symptom is a stubborn cough that lingers. Patients may even be unable to work and become disabled. The disease worsens in autumn and winter, causing them to give up their jobs and toss and turn in bed. When it is warm in spring and summer, the disease is relieved, and they work as if nothing had happened. After several years, they gradually develop difficulty breathing, emphysema and other symptoms, and the pulmonary circulation becomes congested. This leads to left ventricular hypertrophy and valvular incompetence. Finally, edema, cyanosis, liver congestion, hemoptysis, kidney disease and other symptoms develop, similar to those of heart disease. The patient also dies from this. There are many types of this disease, which can be roughly divided into three types as follows:</p>
<p>(1) (Mucopurulent Form) The main symptom is the expectoration of mucopurulent phlegm. It is mostly limited to the lower part of the lungs. It is seen in heavy smokers and those with chronic nasopharyngeal diseases.</p>
<p>(2) Dry Bronchitis The cough is dry and distressing, with difficulty breathing. Forceful coughing only produces a small amount of phlegm. The phlegm is viscous. If it cannot be expelled and accumulates in the bronchi, it is very distressing and causes difficulty breathing. There is also so-called congestive bronchitis, which is seen in heart valve disease. The symptom is a stubborn cough.</p>
<p>(3) Bronchitis Pituitosa The amount of phlegm expectorated is very large, often more than one liter. Its nature is thin and mucous, and often foamy.</p>
<p>If there is bronchial empyema, there is a strong cough and a large amount of mucopurulent phlegm. If there is fetid catarrh, the breath is foul and a large amount of foul-smelling phlegm is coughed up.</p>
<p>Treatment focuses on treating the cause. When stubborn acute bronchitis occurs, apply fundamental therapy immediately. (Take "Fei Huo" (Phith Weal)). Do not allow it to become chronic. Avoid harmful substances such as dust and coal smoke. For dry bronchitis, use inhalants and expectorants. For coughs, use cough suppressants. If there is a lot of phlegm, use Balsam. For the weak, give nutrients and tonics (Conbour's San-Vita-Cell). If it is caused by heart disease, use cardiotonics (Strophant, Digitalis, etc.).</p>
<p>Those suffering from this disease are susceptible to wind and cold. Wear wool underwear to prevent colds. Patients should live in fresh air and should not be confined to a room. Smoking and alcohol are strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>Editor's note: This disease is chronic and difficult to treat. Patients, in particular, suffer from stubborn coughs. The above-mentioned drugs are all symptomatic treatments and have no radical cure. I use "Fei Huo" (Phith Weal) internally for various types of bronchitis. Its effect of dissolving phlegm and relieving cough is very significant. If the phlegm is viscous and accumulates in the bronchi and cannot be expelled, causing difficulty breathing and distress in the chest, relief is seen immediately after taking this. The phlegm disappears and the cough stops. If a radical cure is desired, patients can take it continuously. For mild cases, one month. For long-term cases, two months. Most can be cured. If patients take good care of themselves, there is no risk of recurrence. Moreover, those who take "Fei Huo" can prevent the recurrence of asthma and tuberculosis. Because I have a lot of practical experience, I see that its effectiveness is outstanding. I am writing this specifically to inform those with the same disease.</p>
<h3>Methods for Turning Thin and Weak into Strong and Healthy</h3>
<p>— Zhang Bairen</p>
<p>When a person's body and mind are exhausted and their vitality is weak, they are commonly referred to as "thin and weak". In medical terms, it is "malnutrition". The reason for this is due to long-term illness, or due to excessive work, or due to other reasons, as well as abnormal lifestyle. In addition, more attention should be paid to congenital deficiencies and malnutrition caused by various malignant diseases, such as pulmonary tuberculosis, cancer, malignant neoplasms, and BASEDOW's disease, etc.</p>
<p>The symptoms of thinness and weakness are generally a pale complexion, dry skin, palpitations, headaches, dizziness, tinnitus, blurred vision, constipation, lack of appetite, indigestion, and even edema of the feet and face. The body is afraid of the cold and often prefers warmth. There are also genital disorders. Women experience irregular menstruation, reduced or stopped menstruation, while men experience increased libido, or even nocturnal emission. Patients suffer from weakness due to physical loss. The muscles must be weak. Slight exercise will cause shortness of breath. The gas exchange function of the lungs is insufficient, so tuberculosis is prone to occur. Such frail people are prone to all kinds of diseases and should use nourishing and tonic agents to remedy this.</p>
<p>To remedy thinness and weakness, one must first calm the body and mind and avoid all anger and sorrow. Do not overwork, exercise should be appropriate, often bathe in hot springs, occasionally take walks in the countryside, breathe plenty of fresh air, and regulate bowel movements. Food should be easy to digest and nutritious. Among the most effective medicines, "Kang Shi Sheng Huo Su" CONBOURSSAN-VTA-CELL is the first choice. After taking it, it does not require digestion by the digestive system, but is directly absorbed, creating blood and forming muscles, with no waste. At the same time, it promotes metabolism, increases appetite and digestion, and invigorates all life functions, both physical and mental, with great effect.</p>
<h3>Neurasthenia in Women</h3>
<p>— Dr. Jin Wenan, Female Physician at Hongkou Maternity Hospital</p>
<p>In our clinical practice, we often see women who are prone to melancholy and fond of taking medicine, believing themselves to be terminally ill, in a state of constant anxiety. If asked about their suffering, they claim to have ailments all over their body, yet cannot explain the specific reasons. Common symptoms include headaches, fatigue, back pain, discomfort, sensitivity to cold, loss of appetite, mood swings, anxiety, frequent dreams, restlessness, forgetfulness, and irritability. Upon closer examination, the cause is often neurasthenia resulting from menstrual irregularities.</p>
<p>Menstrual irregularities are the most common gynecological ailment. Therefore, menstruation-regulating medicines are indispensable in gynecology. However, the menstruation-regulating medicines sold on the market, though appearing in great variety, rarely live up to theoretical expectations when put to practical use. Even if there are one or two excellent products, their high price deters people from trying them.</p>
<p>Recently, Merlin Drug Store, the sole agent for "Menorrin," has introduced a product based on effective prescriptions from renowned Chinese and Western gynecology hospitals. It combines dozens of precious menstruation-regulating, blood-nourishing, and uterus-strengthening herbs, and incorporates the essence of "Danggui" (Angelica sinensis), a gynecological medicine praised in ancient China. It is exceptionally effective for various symptoms caused by menstrual irregularities, such as menstrual cramps, amenorrhea, menorrhagia, hypomenorrhea, lower back pain, leukorrhea, cold uterus, and infertility.</p>
<p>Since I began using "Menorrin" in my clinical practice, I have found it to be the answer to previously difficult-to-treat cases of neurasthenia and menstrual irregularities in women. Every patient has been satisfied. Even a distant relative, residing in another province, whose wife was ill, consulted me by letter. I advised her to take "Menorrin," and in less than a month, she wrote back to express her gratitude. Chinese women are particularly prone to qi and blood deficiency and menstrual disorders, which greatly affect their health. The introduction of "Menorrin" provides women with an additional health insurance.</p>

<p>— Written by Dr. Shen Zhaoquan</p>
<p>(II) Various Diseases Caused by Masturbation and Their Treatments</p>
<p>Young and weak individuals who engage in excessive masturbation are prone to the following illnesses: (with corresponding treatments)</p>
<p>(1) General weakness, anemia, pale complexion, heightened sensitivity. (Requires tonics. Taking "Coobour's San-Vita-Cell" is particularly effective.)</p>
<p>(2) Reproductive organ dysfunction: impotence, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, small or curved penis, and developmental changes in the testicles, leading to the complete elimination of reproductive function. (Administer endocrine preparations via injection or oral intake of "WellTonic" for significant results.)</p>
<p>(3) Headaches, dizziness, insomnia, forgetfulness, disorientation, mental depression. (Taking "Meno-ry's Neurotic" or in combination with "WellTonic" provides faster results.)</p>
<p>(4) Spinal cord disorders, lung diseases, mental illnesses, mania, dementia, delusional disorders, cerebral hemorrhage. (For lung diseases, take "Phith Well" or consult a doctor for injection therapy. For other conditions, in addition to taking "Meno-ry's Neurotic" and "WellTonic," consult a doctor for treatment.)</p>
<p>(5) Digestive disorders (stomach problems), nervous anorexia, gastric atony. (Taking "Conbour's San-Vita-Cell" is highly recommended.)</p>
<p>(6) Decline in hearing and vision (myopia, amblyopia). (Taking "Meno-ry's Neurotic" and "WellTonic" are both fundamental cures.)</p>
<p>(7) For those with incomplete development, stunted overall growth and bodily deformities. (Taking "WellTonic" has a special effect.)</p>
<p>(8) Cystitis, prostatitis, orchitis, etc. (Consult a doctor for diagnosis and treatment.)</p>
<p>(9) Fatigue, inability to perform tasks, fear, erratic behavior, lower back pain. (The endocrine preparation "WellTonic" is particularly effective.)</p>
<p>(10) Cardiomegaly, heart failure. (Consult a doctor for diagnosis and treatment.)</p>
<p>Editor's Note: "Well Tonic" is made from Hormon extracted from the youth glands of young animals. It is a modern, universally recognized effective agent for treating sexual neurasthenia. It is, therefore, most suitable for the above-mentioned conditions.</p>

<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Han)</p>
<p>Without strong will and great courage, one cannot become a gentleman or a hero; without naivety and foolishness, one cannot become a virtuous woman or a woman of integrity.</p>
<p>Petty people never tolerate gentlemen, while gentlemen only want to transform petty people. Petty people's intolerance of gentlemen is selfishness, while gentlemen's desire to transform petty people is altruism. Therefore, the words "altruism" and "selfishness" are a measure of a person's moral standing.</p>
<p>A gentleman in poverty and a beautiful woman in tattered clothes both evoke moving sighs. If one is not blind, one must know how to love beauty; if one is not heartless, one must know how to respect a gentleman. A woman's ability to be beautiful is limited by her natural endowments; a man's ability to be a gentleman is limited by his lack of effort. Though not every woman can be a beauty, every man can be a gentleman.</p>
<p>I think education is just an artificial method and not "omnipotent." Education cannot thoroughly change a person's original nature, just as scientists can never invent a method to make horses, cattle, and sheep eat meat, or wolves, tigers, and pigs eat grass.</p>
<p>Bad education harms people more than plagues and wars. Good education is like injecting medicine into a patient. Bad education is simply adding wings to tigers and wolves.</p>
<h3>The Hands of the Chinese</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>Westerners are rich in brains, while Chinese people are skilled with their hands. This, it is said, is what a Western scholar said. He said that Westerners can invent all kinds of mysterious and unpredictable sciences, and can use scientific methods to turn all kinds of ideals into reality, which is something that Chinese people are not good at. But when it comes to art, Westerners are far inferior to Chinese people. Chinese people can write cuneiform characters into extremely beautiful calligraphy. Chinese people can combine irregular lines into beautiful artistic surfaces. Chinese people can use simple tools to create great reliefs. Chinese people can construct solid, magnificent, and beautiful buildings without applying architecture. Western civilization has only been introduced to China for three hundred years, but three hundred years ago, China already had all kinds of artistic products that non-modern Westerners could imitate, all produced entirely with a pair of hands. The hands of the Chinese are truly unmatched by any other nation in the world.</p>
<p>In the past, an American university professor conducted a study on more than forty university students to determine which country's students had the most beautiful handwriting. Among the forty-plus students, there were more than twenty Americans, and about ten each from Europe and Asia, including four Chinese students. According to his research, the top three were all Chinese. The British ranked second. Not a single American student could be ranked among the top ten. There was also a French woman who, it is said, had collected seven large boxes of Chinese embroidery from ancient and modern times, totaling more than 400 pieces. Among these embroideries, many were from the former imperial palace of China, made by embroidery experts from all over the country. Even the non-imperial treasures were embroidered so vividly that even first-class painters could not depict them. Therefore, this French woman, although she had never been to China, would always praise the hands of the Chinese whenever someone admired her collection of embroideries. She said, "If the French had the hands of the Chinese, the value of French art would at least double."</p>
<p>Although art is made from the hands, what is indispensable at the same time is naturally a constructive imagination. Westerners only know how to praise the hands of the Chinese, but do not know how to use their brains, which is naturally like scratching an itch through a boot. In reality, Chinese art has absolutely no mechanical smell, and it is absolutely produced by the combination of hands and brains.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes and Lost Poems of Zhu Yuanchu</h3>
<p>— Aimei</p>
<p>Zhu Xi of Huating, Yuanchu, was a poet of the South Society and a famous writer of Shuoyuan. His untimely death was mourned by the literary world. Even today, although he has passed away for more than ten years, his friends, such as my senior fellow student Liu Tieleng, still often talk to me about his life with sorrow and continue to mourn him.</p>
<p>I have seen articles about Yuanchu in previous issues of the Social Monthly, but they are all speculative. Some say, "Yuanchu indulged in pleasures, leading to his premature death; he did not maintain his reputation, bringing shame upon himself; therefore, he was criticized by Liu Yazi." According to my understanding, Yuanchu was a romantic person, but his wife, Madam Xu, was very virtuous. I believe that while he may have indulged in pleasures, he did not fail to maintain his reputation. As for Yazi's criticism of Yuanchu, it arose from a poetic dispute; Yazi revered the Tang Dynasty, while Yuanchu revered the Song Dynasty: their opinions differed. The claims in that report are a great slander against Yuanchu!</p>
<p>Yuanchu left behind many works, but very few were published. His "Feng Ping Mao Jing Lu," "Tao Li Yin Lu," and other novels were never published as single volumes. What circulates is only the two-volume "Hong Can Jian Ji" compiled by Mr. Shou Juan.</p>
<p>Yuanchu's prose is like "a beautiful woman wearing flowers, charming and lovely," as Mr. Shou Juan commented. And his poems are also unique in style, making people love to recite them. Recently, I found several of his lost works, all of which are not included in the collection; I have recorded them below to spread their influence.</p>
<p>"Night with Liao Gong, sent to Father": "A foot of green lamp illuminates solitary chanting (Liao), a lingering chill touches my sleeves (Yuan); How can mixed feelings be left behind tonight? (Yuan) Light trading ships also answer the distant anvil! (Liao) Wanting to warm the beautiful dreams, the quilt is like water (Liao), Seemingly to complain about idle sorrow, the moon embraces the forest (Liao); Can the poetry soul on the top floor be summoned? (Yuan) The sound of chess is silent, the night is deep (Liao)."</p>
<p>"Responding to Liao Gong, using the original rhyme": "A faint night air blows my sleeves, Ten thousand miles of cold clouds want to snow; Reading the world, a deep cup of spring is vast, Breaking the sky with a hard brush, a hawk circles; Alarming wind and rain in the third watch dream, Hanging eyes on the rivers and lakes, a few points of smoke; Only the primordial spirit is immortal, A short lamp and a lonely mat testify to dry Zen."</p>
<p>Six miscellaneous poems: "The clouds spell out a hundred miles, the road is not far, The flowers and moon of spring on the river are not lonely; Attracting poets to warm beautiful dreams, Coming south to see Zheng Yingtao again." "Spring returns, still protecting the swallows, Outside the flowers, a gentle breeze, the sun sets in the west; Seeing the black oil car passing by, Turning back drunk like mud." "Pick up the red beans with lovesickness; The southern country, a prosperous spring, is full of branches. Gradually old, why not mistakenly cut it, Want him to spread the legend to answer the return date."</p>
<p>"Not necessarily the amorous feelings are casually light, Sighing cold and asking warmth are full of sadness; Remember from the second time to pity parting, And then go up to the red building to see you." "The side people are nosy jealous of mandarin ducks, Each holding infatuation, cannot be traded; If you can pass on a word when you meet: The girl has now married Wang Chang."</p>
<p>"Tears to see each other again at this time: What is the purpose of the previous words as a joke? Outside the Pubu Pavilion, a slight cold penetrates, To sing the wind and feelings, two hundred poems."</p>
<h3>One Drum of Qi</h3>

<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 21: The Delicate Woman Indulges with Yue Mao; The Fierce Son-in-Law Listens to the Lion's Roar from the Next Room.</p>
<p>He said, "I've already found out clearly that it is possible to remit silver dollars from here to Shanghai, but it costs a little more in remittance fees." A man slowly responded, "I will naturally raise the funds for you. But I can't raise silver dollars in Xi'an City." The woman shouted, "Nonsense! This is the provincial capital of Shaanxi. If you can't raise funds in the provincial capital, where can you raise them?" The bureau chief said in a low voice, "Madam, please lower your voice. This Little Western Paradise is full of political travelers. If you shout it out loud, I certainly won't have any face, and you won't have any face either, right?" Following these words, there was a loud thud from the next room, clearly someone slapping the table. Then the woman was heard saying, "Why shouldn't I say it? I insist on saying it. Do you even know how to care about face? If you knew how to care about face, you wouldn't rely on my father's influence to come to the Northwest to make a small fortune. Hmph! You still know how to care about face; don't say anything good to me. The bureau chief immediately made a pleading sound, saying in a low voice, "There are people all around, please spare me, don't make any more noise. As for the money you want, I'll take care of it when I return to Gansu. I'll give you as much money as you want." The woman said in a harsh voice, "If you want me to go to Gansu, that's fine, but you have to give me three thousand dollars." The bureau chief said with a smiling tone, "Such a large sum, I'm afraid it won't be easy, right?" The woman said, "Is this sum large? If I don't leave, I'll wait for you in Xi'an, and you'll return to Gansu tomorrow and bring me three thousand dollars. If you bring one dollar less, I'll call my father and report you, so that you can't be a petty official anymore. What kind of capable person are you, you can't even write a coherent letter."

<h3>The Japanese Chrysanthemum Exhibition (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>The cultivation history of small chrysanthemums is not as long as that of large and medium chrysanthemums. Originally, there was only one type of single-petal medal chrysanthemum, the flower type on Japanese medals, with a diameter of only one or two inches and many colors, mostly made into cliff shapes. The flowers are dense, and the branches and leaves are not visible when in full bloom, like a flower screen, which is also interesting. Three years ago, Mr. Takeuchi of Aomori Prefecture planted a cliff chrysanthemum named "Light Makeup," which was eight feet wide and reached a height of one foot five feet and six inches, which is truly a strange tale from overseas. Another type of small chrysanthemum cultivation is even more peculiar, entirely cultivated using bonsai methods, and has recently been praised by chrysanthemum artists. The interest of small chrysanthemums is different from that of large and medium chrysanthemums, entirely focused on posture and interest. The branches of a chrysanthemum are curved like pine and cypress trees, and at first glance, one would think they are ordinary pine and cypress bonsai. When they bloom, the autumn light is scattered, which is also interesting.</p>
<p>These small chrysanthemums were originally transplanted from wild ones in the mountains, and are similar to our wild chrysanthemums. They are only three or four minutes in diameter, and the branches are older, with an ochre-black color, unlike the stems of large and medium chrysanthemums, which still have herbaceous properties. When planting, the method is the same as ordinary bonsai, supplemented by mountain rocks and moss, and can be arranged arbitrarily. Often exposing its fine roots, coiling on the rocks, like pine roots. Sometimes hanging upside down, like willows. The shapes are ever-changing, entirely directed by humans. I once saw a most peculiar one, made of old bamboo, made into a water-drawing balance frame (of course very small), one end hanging a heavy object, one end hanging a small chrysanthemum, the root part entirely exposed in the air, only the root tip attached to the soil, and the flowers and leaves were still flourishing, which is truly imaginative.</p>
<p>The types of Japanese chrysanthemums seem to be fewer than those in our country, and even the most common Erqiao and Mosheng are not seen, let alone others. Therefore, if our country improves its planting methods, it will surely surpass Japan.</p>
<p>The first one sings about Hangzhou, marking the first meeting Also knowing that Hangzhou is full of illusions, Recording the first meeting with frequent tears, Green plum bamboo horse human love, Who else leans on the door and talks about the sunset glow? (Describing the childhood situation of Mao Yi to others, the mother-in-law, Madam Duanmu Juchu, also passed away several years ago)</p>
<p>The second one sings about Nanchang, marking the old tour Glittering sun shines on the city to Zhangmen, Peach blossoms and human faces prove the ancient plain, The remaining life of morning dew is startling at the end of the year, Xiao is remnant and still has unsold souls.</p>
<p>The third one sings about Wan'an, marking the boat meeting Curving port, clear waves illuminate the shallow beach, Sparse lights are flickering, the night is just beginning, Hard to forget the second hometown moon, Passing Wan'an in the sound of water tunes.</p>
<p>The fourth one sings about Wangmu Ferry, marking the Hong imprint Clear posture like water, lively double eyes, Hurriedly leaving the flag, far up with sorrow, Baishi autumn sound Wangmu Ferry, The golden age traces back to the beginning. (Wangmu Ferry is a small market town south of Ganxian) The fifth one sings about Luofan Pavilion, marking the wedding day Arrogant frost and beautiful color bright Qionghua, Green oars and red buildings are covered and opened, The seclusion of Luofan Pavilion is absolute under the water, The sun is slanting, the wind is calm, bear to come again. (The time was Gengxu two years before the Republic of China)</p>
<p>The sixth one sings about Atlantic City, marking the year of Mao Yi's death Atlantic City blue sky, Pouring dense shade Shu Brocade scales, The high railing once leaned together, The new cold season, the Ma'er year.</p>
<p>The seventh one sings about Anting, Rest Pavilion, marking the separation A dream is startled, when will it wake up, Still seeing the soft branches hanging in the eyes, It can be regarded as the destination of labor, The sunset outside the willows arrives at Anting. (The location is in the German-town district of Fei City, USA)</p>
<p>The eighth one sings about Moonlight Hill, marking the death The shadow of the laurel on Xiqiu Hill flows long, The flower affairs are exhausted, breaking the guest's heart, The melancholy days of stroking the coffin and paying tribute, The sea is dry, the rocks are rotten, there is still light.</p>
<p>The ninth one sings about Hongqiao, marking the end of life's regrets Lush barren tombs are submerged in the dust, The sea shore Hongqiao is vast and cannot be climbed, This regret does not follow the heaven and earth to grow old, The sin of ungrateful love is greater than the mountain.</p>
<p>The tenth one sings about the seventeenth year, used to end the whole article The vicissitudes of life are like dreams, the bones become dust, Pointing out the rivers and mountains, the traces have been Chen, It is another heart-wrenching year of seventeen, Suddenly turning back to cry this person. (Mao Yi was seventeen when she got married on the first day of the tenth month of Gengxu, which was really the first happy event in my life.)</p>
<h3>Mao Yi's Legacy</h3>
<p>Rambling Words</p>
<h3>A Comparison of One Thousand Days and Six Thousand Days of Sleep</h3>
<p>— Yizhi Village Person</p>
<p>Miss Patricia Maguire, the Iionois state queen who won the Miss America beauty contest for three consecutive years, does not know what kind of stimulus she experienced, and suddenly began to sleep soundly from February 25, 1932, three and a half years ago. The doctors who treated the nerves were very busy, and everyone said that if they could read Miss Baoli's diary, they might be able to make a quick recovery, but the lady's mother firmly refused to show her daughter's diary to others, so that she slept for more than a thousand days, almost becoming a unique good sleeper in ancient and modern times in the East and West with Chen Bo, who lived in seclusion in Huayue. When I occasionally heard about this, I was secretly moved by the idea, saying that if my beloved Mao Yi, who died of illness seventeen years ago, could live for six thousand days, which is equivalent to a long sleep of one thousand days like Miss Baoli, wouldn't it be enough to eliminate the endless grief in the world? Therefore, I wrote ten poems to record the great regret that the scientific community has no way to return souls.</p>

<p>My home is on the bank of South Lake, but I am serving outside, with few meetings and many partings. Reading Uncle Fan's South Lake Tune, it is like awakening old dreams. Bu Jun赋四时, I cannot avoid the humiliation of following suit.</p>
<p>Green waves rise in spring, the trees are fluttering, carrying wine and calling friends to chase the sunset tide, Half of the water journey is covered in light smoke and rain, see who is the first to dock at the lake bridge. (Spring) Everyone says they love gold, but I love hibiscus embroidered as a quilt, Thirty hectares of scenery is completely similar, Randomly flipping red waves, shaking the heart of the Lang. (Summer) The frost is invading the silk socks of the 鷁首, I wonder why it is so cold at night, The autumn light on the lake is old every year, I only remember the sound of selling water chestnuts. (Autumn) The pagoda shadows and building foundations are covered with snow, cold fishing raincoat on the fishing reef, Which of my sisters is similar, The sky and water stop and condense, embracing the white beauty.

<h3>Rural Medicine and Rural Revival</h3>
<p>— Yin Zhanwu</p>
<p>Rural medicine means promoting modern medicine to rural areas. In other words, it is to enable the general rural people to have the opportunity to enjoy modern medicine.</p>
<p>More than eighty-five percent of China's population are farmers. Most farmers do not have hygienic habits, and they lack even more common knowledge of medicine. As a result, they are mentally exhausted and suffer from many diseases. Whenever epidemics occur, there is no way to stop them, and in the end, they can only await death helplessly. The annual reports of deaths from such diseases are alarming. In recent years, the reasons for rural bankruptcy and the inability to revive are, on the one hand, due to the panic of the rural economy and the inability to increase production due to natural disasters. However, the rural people do not have healthy bodies, and when they are sick, they cannot seek treatment. Therefore, the fact that people cannot make a living is also a major reason for rural bankruptcy and the inability to revive. Therefore, promoting rural medicine is truly a means to reduce the pain of people's illnesses and is also a place to create health and happiness for the people. Its relationship with rural revival is extremely important.</p>
<p>Regarding the organization of rural medical institutions, we need not discuss it for the time being, because the authorities who run rural medicine have their own set of rules for such issues. As long as there are sufficient funds and talents, it can be organized and run. What I want to talk about here are three points that should be noted when running rural medicine, written below for the reference of those who are running rural medicine.</p>
<p>(A) Running Rural Medicine Must Consider the Rural Economy</p>
<p>Everyone knows about the bankruptcy of the rural economy. Therefore, for the first step in rural medicine, we must first consider the economy of the farmers. In cities, we often see that there are many hospitals, clinics, and private hospitals. The consultation fees they charge are very high, and the medicines they use are also unusually complex. As for what imported goods are, they are often fond of using them. The expensiveness of their value can be imagined. There are even many snobbish doctors or hospitals that regard selling medicine as a business nature and have no charitable heart. They often sell medicine for one corner that originally costs one fen. With such medicine prices, the seller obtains heavy profits and is naturally happy, while the buyer resents the high price of new medicines, which makes it impossible for ordinary people to afford them. How can those poor farmers who are in the midst of rural bankruptcy not be afraid of medicine? How can the general farmers have the opportunity to enjoy medicine? Therefore, I hope that those who run rural medicine must keep the consultation fees low and the medicines used simple and reliable, without using imported medicines. The medicine fees must also contain the nature of free distribution, and must not focus solely on business and seek heavy profits. Otherwise, the farmers' fear of medicine will increase day by day, and at the same time, their faith in new medicine will also decrease day by day. If this continues, rural medicine will inevitably decline one day. At that time, can we still talk about the issues of "rural medicine" and "rural revival"!</p>
<p>(B) Running Rural Medicine Must Focus on Rural Hygiene</p>
<p>It goes without saying that it is a terrible thing that rural people do not pay attention to hygiene and do not know the common sense of medicine. Especially when an infectious disease is prevalent, there is no talk of some common sense of medicine regarding the isolation of patients and the disposal of excrement. When infectious diseases spread and people get sick and die, they blame heaven and think it is an inevitable event. In the summer of the twentieth year of the Republic of China, cholera was prevalent in the author's hometown, Huangxu, Zhenjiang. Farmers did not isolate themselves, resulting in as many as 20 people being infected in one day. A certain doctor who knew a little about new medicine also contracted the disease due to improper epidemic prevention. Later, the Jiangsu Provincial Hospital sent doctors to the countryside for diagnosis and treatment before it was cleared up. From this example, we can see how painful it is for a farmer who has no hygienic habits and does not understand the common sense of medicine to suffer this unexpected premature death. However, who gave them this? Is there no way to remedy it? Who can take on this responsibility of remediation? Therefore, promoting rural medicine and focusing on rural hygiene is truly an improved method to remedy farmers and prevent them from suffering unexpected deaths. This responsibility should of course be taken up by those who run rural medicine. As for how to instill medical knowledge in farmers and cultivate their hygienic habits, in addition to implementing hygienic work that is beneficial to farmers, one must take advantage of the opportunity of examining patients to tell them more about the pain and danger of suffering from this disease, how this disease is contracted, and how to prevent it after contracting it. What are the advantages and disadvantages of preventing such diseases? In addition, one must also take advantage of rest after diagnosis and treatment. Whenever farmers are resting, whether under the bean trellis or under the melon vines, they can be told a little common sense of hygiene and medical stories anytime, anywhere. According to this approach, I think it will be simpler and more effective than those propaganda, poster posting, meeting, and speechmaking works that play the lute to a cow. Therefore, I sincerely hope that those who run rural medicine must have the determination to "eliminate troubles before they happen." When running rural medicine, they must pay attention to the hygiene of farmers and must not only focus on treatment work, focusing solely on increasing the number of treatments and forgetting the work of preventing diseases.</p>
<p>(C) Running Rural Medicine Must Investigate the Health of Farmers</p>
<p>General hygienists often say this: "The countryside is better than the city. The countryside has natural scenery, fresh air, and sufficient sunlight. The food used is all grown and eaten by themselves, fresh and delicious. Living in this environment is truly mentally peaceful and exceptionally happy..." Indeed, the countryside has such advantages. Therefore, nine out of ten farmers stand out with their chests puffed out and their heads held high. However, they do not have healthy guidance and lack common sense of hygiene and science. They often discard the natural gifts and do not care about their own health problems. Therefore, they become weak and sick, and eventually reach the point of seeking medical treatment and medication, leading to death. Like this, even if they have strong bodies, without proper health preservation methods, how can they not make the rural people tend towards decline and death day by day? We know that the ultimate goal of running rural medicine is to enable every farmer to develop hygienic habits and understand the common sense of medicine, so as to achieve the health of the entire rural population. Therefore, in addition to the two items that I hope to pay attention to above, we must also investigate the degree of health of the people at any time and place. We must instruct the farmers and tell the people what are the benefits of fresh air, where are the benefits of bathing and sunbathing, why it is better to eat brown rice, and what kinds of foods contain large amounts of protein, fat carbohydrates, vitamins, iron, salt, and water, etc., and substances that have nutritional value to humans. If we run it like this, then rural medicine will have a day of progress, and the countryside can be considered to have hope of revival.</p>
<p>(D) Conclusion</p>
<p>Running rural medicine is not only an urgent task that cannot be delayed in present-day China, but also needs to be carried out as soon as possible. Therefore, the above three points, the matters that should be paid attention to when running rural medicine, are truly not to be ignored. As for how low the consultation fees and medicine prices should be set so that farmers do not feel burdened and are happy to enjoy them, this can be determined by the authorities running rural medicine, taking into account the funding of the authorities. In addition, when instilling medical knowledge in farmers, instructing farmers in hygienic habits, and leading them on the road to health, what methods should be used to make farmers interested and happy to receive them? In addition to the points mentioned above, I hope that our medical and health circles will work together to explore ways to make the rural people, and even the people of the whole country, understand medical and health matters, drive away diseases, and embark on the road to health. In this way, the future of medicine can be celebrated, and the revival of the countryside is promising. Not only is the revival of the countryside promising, but the revival of the entire nation is also possible one day.</p>
<h3>Amidst the Anti-Tuberculosis Campaign, What We Should Know About Tuberculosis (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Zhong Zhihe</p>
<p>Tuberculosis is destroying China, and this is not alarmist or exaggerated. It is a real possibility. If we look at the results of medical investigations, the number of Chinese people suffering from tuberculosis is second only to venereal diseases. The number of patients reaches 16 million each year, and the number of deaths each year accounts for 1.6 million. On average, there are 4,000 people with tuberculosis out of every 100,000 people, 400 out of every 10,000, 40 out of every 1,000, and 4 out of every 100. However, according to recent statistics, venereal diseases account for 6.7%, while tuberculosis accounts for 5.3%. If we take Shanghai's 4 million residents as an example, on average, there are at least 100,000 patients. According to the mortality rate, 1.6 million people die each year nationwide. If they were concentrated in a corner of Shanghai, the citizens of Shanghai would all be sacrifices of tuberculosis in less than three years. If we do not urgently find ways to prevent the rampancy of this alarming fact, not only will the economy suffer a major impact, but before long, the disaster of national destruction and racial extinction will be imminent. The harm of tuberculosis is so severe. How can Bodhisattvas stand idly by and wait for death without urgently seeking ways to prevent and treat it? As an ancient proverb says, "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle." Another says, "It is appropriate to prevent things before they happen." Then we can know that there is no strategy that does not have a way to prevent and overcome it. The key is that we can cooperate fully and without the slightest懈, then stopping it is naturally possible, and destroying it is not impossible. Compatriots across the country should quickly wake up. Now I will describe tuberculosis in detail, so that the people of the country have a considerable understanding of it, and then talking about prevention can achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>(1) Definition of Tuberculosis</p>
<p>The reason why tuberculosis is named tuberculosis is that people in the past thought that it was caused by excessive exertion and damage to the lungs. The Western name Phthisis refers to consumption and decline. The modern name tuberculosis is because Professor Robert Koch, a German medical professor, discovered tubercle bacilli in the small tubercles of the lungs 53 years ago, in 1882. Therefore, it is called tuberculosis. The difficult problem that medical scientists all over the world are researching day and night and urgently need to solve is finally revealed and solved easily. His contribution to the benefit of mankind is truly great.</p>
<p>(2) Types of Tuberculosis</p>
<p>People in ancient China commonly called tuberculosis 72 kinds, which means that there are many kinds of tuberculosis. However, according to the research of new doctors recently, there are more than these kinds of tuberculosis that people's organs suffer from. For example, when the disease is in the lymph nodes, it is called scrofula. When the disease is in the skin, it is called lupus. When the disease is in the bone, it is called bone tuberculosis. When the disease is in the intestine, it is called intestinal tuberculosis. When the disease is in the throat, it is called laryngeal tuberculosis. When the disease is in the bladder, it is called bladder tuberculosis, and so on.</p>
<p>In short, all parts of the human body are easily vulnerable to the invasion of tubercle bacilli, and thus become what is called tuberculosis. However, to sum it up, tuberculosis can be roughly divided into four categories: (1) Pulmonary tuberculosis, which is a disease in both lungs. (2) Bone tuberculosis, which is a disease in the joints and bones. (3) Skin tuberculosis. (4) Organ tuberculosis, which is a disease in various organs of the human body.</p>
<p>(3) Causes of Tuberculosis</p>
<p>(1) Gender: Male accounts for 3.79%, Female 3.82%</p>
<p>(2) Age: Infants have weak resistance and are more likely to be infected. There are many patients under the age of five. The number increases again in adulthood, and gradually decreases in old age.</p>
<h3>A Study of Vaccination (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Yue Qi</p>
<p>—Medical Story No. 13—</p>
<p>Some years later, a funny story happened. At that time, Queen Catherine had a new lover to replace Orlov, named Vassilchikov, who was a handsome and strong young man. Orlov in Moscow learned of this disturbing news and immediately set off back to St. Petersburg to investigate. Catherine was unwilling to have her love affair interfered with by her old lover, so she sent an army to stop him on the road and imprisoned him in the official residence in Gatchina, claiming that she was "afraid that he would spread the smallpox that was prevalent in St. Petersburg at the time." Of course, some years ago, in order to inform the people, this queen had issued a bulletin saying that Orlov had undergone a "planting flower" operation and could avoid smallpox from then on. Whether she was forgetful or deliberately forgetting, it is impossible to know.</p>
<p>In short, when Kinner began to consider vaccination to prevent smallpox, "smallpox can be prevented" had become a popular opinion. Many women who squeezed breast milk unintentionally received "planting flowers" because they had sores on their hands when squeezing the breasts of cows with poxes; they did not develop smallpox later. In 1796, Kinner began his experiments. He took pus from a sore on the hand of a milkmaid named Sarah Nelmer and transplanted it onto an eight-year-old boy named James Phipps. It is not difficult to imagine the boy's fear at the time. The famous small bronze statue "Kinner's First Vaccination" made by the sculptor Monteveede later became an ornament on the table in the doctor's living room. Here we can see the face of the young subject twisted with extreme horror. This is natural, because, just like Columbus, he was sailing into a new, strange, dark, and unmapped ocean, and a poison was being put into his body. No one could predict what would happen. What happened to James Phipps and Xunla. Nami later? Undoubtedly, they lived ordinary lives in the milk shed. We know their names only because they once had contact with a genius. Only in a brief moment did they appear on the stage of history—their names, their ages, their suffering were revealed—and after this moment they disappeared again.</p>
<p>Three months after James Phipps was vaccinated, Kinner injected smallpox pus into his skin, but it had no effect. In the early days of surgery, Kinner performed such experiments on the recipients. In 1800, Benjamin Warerhouse, the first vaccination doctor in the United States, vaccinated his own seven children. Later, he sent them to the smallpox isolation ward, and none of them developed smallpox. In 1802, Waterhouse vaccinated nineteen children. Later, he injected smallpox pus under the skin of twelve of them: none of them developed smallpox. At the same time, he injected smallpox pus under the skin of two unvaccinated children; both developed smallpox. Osler called this "one of the most decisive experiments in the history of vaccination."</p>
<p>Because smallpox was so harmful in the 18th century, and because the public at that time had confidence in the effectiveness of "planting flowers," the popularity of vaccination was faster and more widespread than any other equally dangerous and equally novel new medical technique. In 1805, even Napoleon, who was as stubborn as he was, actually issued an order to have his entire army vaccinated. As for the opinions of the clergy on vaccination at that time, they can be divided into two factions. One faction regarded this as an act of interfering with the will of the omnipotent God, and the other faction! For example, the bishop of Worcester—spoke on behalf of the publicity and vigorously promoted it. However, in the minds of many, many people, they still regarded vaccination as fearful, and some even said, "People who are vaccinated with cowpox will have bovine nature." A contemporary satirical painting, depicting many vaccinated people with horns on their heads and hideous faces, is evidence of this kind of skeptical thinking.</p>
<h3>Common Sense Q&amp;A about Diseases</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(73) Cancer of the Liver and Bile Ducts</p>
<p>(Q) How do people get cancer of the liver and bile ducts?</p>
<p>(A) Most cancers in this area are secondary to stomach cancer, uterine pain, breast cancer, or esophageal cancer through the portal vein; but there are also primary cancers in this area due to liver cirrhosis, gallstones, Clonorchis sinensis, etc.</p>
<p>(Q) After suffering from liver cancer, what changes occur in the liver?</p>
<p>(A) Some have localized cancerous nodules in a part of the liver; some have cancer cells infiltrating the interlobular tissue of the liver.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the symptoms of a patient with liver cancer?</p>
<p>(A) If the cancer is not very large and is in the central part of the liver, there are no symptoms.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the common symptoms?</p>
<p>(A) The diseased liver is very enlarged, with many nodules on the surface, which are hard and tender to the touch.</p>
<p>(Q) Is the function of the liver itself affected by cancer?</p>
<p>(A) If the cancer compresses the bile ducts or is blocked, jaundice or cholermia must occur. If it compresses the portal vein and inferior vena cava, portal vein blood symptoms such as ascites, intestinal blood, splenomegaly, etc. occur, and there is also lower extremity edema.</p>
<p>(Q) Can liver cancer metastasize to other parts?</p>
<p>(A) It often metastasizes to the peritoneum or lungs through the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the overall appearance of the body?</p>
<p>(A) It is the same as cancer in other parts, showing cancerous cachexia.</p>
<p>(Q) Are there any obstacles in the patient's digestive system?</p>
<p>(A) Yes. Loss of appetite and vomiting often occur. Because bile is blocked and cannot be infused into the intestines, the intestinal contents rot and ferment, causing flatulence. Meat and fat cannot be digested. Constipation.</p>
<p>(Q) What changes occur in the urine of a patient with liver cancer?</p>
<p>(A) The urine is thick and contains bile pigment, bile acid, and protein, and the indigo reaction is positive.</p>
<p>(Q) Does the body have a fever?</p>
<p>(A) Generally, there is no fever. However, a few show remittent fever.</p>
<p>(Q) How to diagnose liver cancer?</p>
<p>(A) Just rely on age, cachexia, changes in the liver, jaundice, lymphadenopathy, etc.</p>
<p>(Q) What diseases should it be distinguished from?</p>
<p>(A) Liver cancer should be distinguished from liver cirrhosis, liver syphilis, liver abscess, pyloric cancer, liver echinococcosis, and melanoma.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the prognosis of liver cancer?</p>
<p>(A) Absolutely dangerous. At most, it will be fatal within half a year or a year.</p>
<p>(Q) How to treat it?</p>
<p>(A) There is no treatment method; only symptomatic methods are used. Recently, the use of radium radiation has not been consistently effective.</p>
<h3>Common Sense Q&amp;A about Teeth (10)</h3>
<p>— Lin Jianxian</p>
<p>(Question 51) What is the nature of cementum?</p>
<p>(Answer) Cementum, like tooth enamel, surrounds the dentin. As mentioned above, tooth enamel only surrounds the crown part. Below the crown, the part where the root and the alveolar wall are connected is surrounded by a very thin layer of cementum. Cementum is also considered a type of hard tooth tissue, but it is not as hard as tooth enamel or dentin.</p>
<p>(Question 52) What is the periodontal membrane?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is a thin membrane rich in blood vessels and nerves, surrounding the outside of the cementum layer. In other words, it is located between the root and the alveolar wall. The entire weight of chewing is borne by this membrane.</p>
<p>(Question 53) What is the use of cementum?</p>
<p>(Answer) Because the surface of cementum is rough, it is used to connect the connective tissue around the teeth, so that the teeth are fixed in the alveolar socket and can be chewed without falling out.</p>
<p>(Question 54) What is the use of the periodontal membrane?</p>
<p>(Answer) There are three uses: (1) Connecting teeth and surrounding soft and hard tissues; it can also be used as a buffer, so that the teeth can move slightly freely during chewing, and can also reduce friction with the alveolar wall. (2) Manufacturing and nourishing cementum. (3) Rich in tactile sensation, it can feel the weight of teeth biting things. Therefore, if there is something wrong with the periodontal membrane, the teeth will feel swollen and painful to the touch, making it difficult to chew.</p>
<p>(Question 55) The dead teeth can still be used for chewing. Is it the credit of the periodontal membrane?</p>
<p>(Answer) That's right. Although the teeth are dead, as long as the periodontal membrane is good, the cementum will be nourished and can live as usual, and the teeth can still be fixed in the alveolar socket and chewed as usual. However, it is not as good as live teeth. Section 1 Tooth Decay</p>
<p>(Question 56) Which dental disease is the most common?</p>
<p>(Answer) Tooth decay.</p>
<p>(Question 57) What kind of disease is tooth decay?</p>
<p>(Answer) Tooth decay is also called dental caries, which means that the teeth rot into cavities, starting from the tooth enamel and gradually deepening into the dentin. If it is not stopped, it can decay through the pulp chamber, the pulp can become inflamed and necrotic, and even fester, causing abscesses and other diseases.</p>
<h3>Medical Science of Pain Relief (41)</h3>
<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>Chloroform: It tastes sweet and has a great hypnotic effect. Short-term use can be considered wonderful, but prolonged use is extremely dangerous. The greatest danger during use is the suppression of the heart. The person under anesthesia may experience cardiac arrest first, leading to death, followed by respiratory arrest. Apart from temporary heart damage, the liver suffers the most damage after using a large amount of chloroform. Severe liver damage can also have very serious consequences.</p>
<p>Ethyl Chloride: Shares similar properties with chloroform. In addition to its hypnotic effect, it can be sprayed for local anesthesia.</p>
<p>Ethylene: Odorless, quick-acting, and painless, with minimal side effects, making it the best among anesthetics. However, it is difficult to store, prone to explosion, and requires careful management.</p>
<p>Avertin: An anesthetic invented in recent years. It is administered by enema into the rectum. Within minutes of administration, the patient can fall into peaceful sleep, lasting for several hours, without feeling any pain. Using half the dose is safer; using the full dose in critical situations is difficult to reverse. Using half the dose combined with another anesthetic is safer.</p>
<p>Evapan Sod: Also a recently discovered anesthetic, administered intravenously. It shares similar properties with Avertin, with the same advantages and disadvantages. These two anesthetics still have room for research and are expected to improve in the future.</p>
<p>The above briefly covers the practical uses of anesthetics, which is basic knowledge of anesthesiology. Anesthesia is one of the sciences of pain relief and not a mystical art.</p>
<p>Local Anesthetics</p>
<p>Although anesthetics can relieve pain, their use in various major and minor surgical procedures is often unsuitable. Using anesthetics for minor local surgery is also uneconomical. For example, in tooth extraction or other minor local incisions, the harm to the body may outweigh the benefits of the anesthetic. Some anesthetic gases may have fewer harmful effects but are expensive and impractical for widespread use. Due to this demand, and with advancements in basic sciences, various local anesthetics have been gradually researched and developed, offering greater convenience and economic advantages than anesthetics. This represents another step forward in reducing human suffering and increasing human happiness.</p>
<p>The public often views scientific inventions as accidental, but this is not the case. No invention in the world is purely accidental. Although they may sometimes appear so, inventions are actually the result of in-depth research. This is true for various sciences, and medical inventions are no exception. Take the discovery of various local anesthetics as an example: despite groundbreaking discoveries in the past, continuous research is still necessary today. Here is a brief account of one or two of the discovery processes:</p>
<h3>Notice from This Publication</h3>
<p>This publication does not endorse "consulting and treating illnesses via circular letters." We will not respond to inquiries about disease treatment. This is a formal declaration.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on Pulmonary Tuberculosis (76)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>In addition to sunlight therapy, artificial light therapy is also worth mentioning. The most common of these is naturally the artificial sun lamp! It also uses ultraviolet rays to cause skin pigmentation. It has a beneficial effect on the general symptoms of the disease, such as appetite and various subjective symptoms of the patient. It is not suitable for progressive disease, elevated temperature, or hemoptysis. It is especially contraindicated in cases with exudative pleurisy complications.</p>
<p>X-ray therapy is often suitable for tuberculosis outside the lungs. It has not been widely adopted for pulmonary tuberculosis, and there are no notable achievements to report.</p>
<p>Section 5: Non-Specific Stimulation Therapy</p>
<p>What is non-specific stimulation therapy? Broadly speaking, the salt restriction method and light therapy mentioned above can all be considered part of it. The following discussion is in a narrow sense, which can be roughly divided into three categories: (1) protein bodies, (2) lipoid bodies, and (3) drugs. Most of those belonging to the third category are metal salt preparations. The value of each type and the appropriate circumstances will now be described below:</p>
<p>(1) Protein Bodies: We know that the application of protein bodies has the potential to improve tuberculous inflammatory states, but the results of application do not have much use for lung changes. Its only contribution is that it improves the patient's general condition and appetite, which is worth noting. There are countless such preparations; the most common are milk, Oren, and dry protein. All require injection procedures. In addition, animal serum protein is sometimes also used for treatment, including sheep, cow, horse, and pig. Such animal serum injections sometimes cause a systemic reaction (high fever), but the improvement in body weight is undeniable. It is sometimes very suitable for progressive disease. However, it is contraindicated in patients with amyloidosis, cavities, valvular heart defects, or intestinal tuberculosis.</p>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>Awards for Academic Research</h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>To promote the development of a nation's culture, it is essential to fully encourage academic research. Recently, the Academic Research Association suggested to the Fifth National Congress that a special agency be established to promote academic awards. The proposed measures include: (1) establishing a special academic award agency and allocating funds from the Geng Qing Cultural Foundation for academic awards; (2) allowing Chinese citizens engaged in specialized academic research or writing to submit their work to the award agency for credit-based assistance until their research or writing is successful; (3) awarding generous prizes for exceptional academic inventions by Chinese citizens, such as machines or other creations, in addition to government patents; and (4) offering substantial awards in advance for major national projects and reforms, openly soliciting contributions.</p>
<p>Academic research is highly valued in countries around the world. These countries have award systems for those engaged in specialized academic research. Those who achieve significant results through research are highly respected by the state. It is common for foreign scholars engaged in academic research to receive not only research facilities (such as the use of libraries, instruments, and the supply of materials) but also financial support from their governments. For example, when the great German scientist Albert Einstein (now expelled) turned fifty, the mayor of Berlin even offered him a park (which Einstein refused) in recognition of his work. This is because academic research is deeply and significantly related to culture, so countries reward it generously. This is why academic research flourishes in advanced European and American countries, and why their national cultures are so developed.</p>
<p>In China, the construction of various national undertakings is not yet on track, so there is little time to consider academic research awards. As a result, aside from the Academia Sinica, the Zhongshan Cultural Center, and a few academic organizations formed by academics, very few individuals are engaged in specialized academic research. It is an enormous loss to Chinese culture. The remedy is for the state to establish an academic award agency to encourage research and promote cultural development.</p>
<p>The award measures suggested by the Academic Research Association are very important. In particular, items two and three, if implemented, would be even more effective. Those with talent but without the means to engage in academic research could conduct research at their leisure with state assistance. And awarding academic inventions would increase the inventor's motivation and spark the interest of others in research. This has a significant impact on Chinese culture, and it is hoped that the authorities will not overlook it so that China's nascent academic research can gradually prosper.</p>
<h3>Old Classmate</h3>
<p>— Zhang Wen</p>
<p>One misty evening, I was returning from the office. Because I hadn't brought rain gear, I got off the bus and ran head down toward the alley. As I neared my door, I bumped into someone coming out of the stone-gate house next door. I stopped and apologized, but the man grabbed me and called me by the name I used in school. He was wearing a worn autumn coat, with the collar turned up, and in the dimly lit alley, I could hardly make out his face. Seeing my hesitation, he gave his surname. It turned out to be Lao Huang, the famous athlete from middle school. We had parted ways nearly eight years ago. Although I had seen his name in sports sections of newspapers, I couldn't remember which university he had attended. After graduation, we had no contact. In middle school, due to differing interests, we rarely interacted. We would occasionally nod in greeting on the sports field or in front of the school gate. Now, meeting again felt like encountering an old acquaintance in a foreign land. We shook hands tightly, silently gazing at each other, as if trying to guess what the other had gone through in the past eight years. After standing in the drizzle for a while, he spoke first, inviting me to sit in his room. He lived in this stone-gate house. I told him that I lived next door, and we couldn't</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>help but chuckle.</p>
<p>Feeling our way up the dark stairs, he said softly, "Don't laugh at me, I live in the attic." His voice was somewhat hesitant, as if this was a secret he couldn't tell. In the past few years, none of the old classmates I had met were doing well. I myself am a regular tenant in the attic. Several friends I associate with are also attic dwellers. For a generous and handsome athlete to live in the attic and be hesitant to reveal it, I felt that he must have been living such a lonely life for the past eight years. I didn't respond, waiting for him to open the door in the darkness, and I followed him into the attic.</p>
<p>He turned on the electric light, invited me to sit on the bed, and busied himself pouring hot water from the thermos and offering cigarettes. He apologized for his messy bedroom, using words that I couldn't quite understand. He seemed completely transformed from the crude student he once was. I looked around the small bedroom. Several women's cheongsams were hanging on the wall next to the bed, and several boxes of cheap face powder and rouge were left on a washstand. Before I could ask him, "Did you get married?", he patted my shoulder and told me:</p>
<p>"Marrying a wife is really undesirable! If I go out for a little while, the house becomes such a mess. She still doesn't want to come back at this time, and I don't know how to cook supper." Lao Huang sighed deeply, his hands in his pockets—this reminded me of the embarrassed look he had when he failed to be selected for the last sports meet.</p>
<p>Although I have been living a topsy-turvy life these past few years, and have therefore learned a little about the art of dealing with people, I can't use those irrelevant words to敷衍—or rather, comfort him—before an old classmate. In this turbulent and extraordinary era, young people are directly oppressed on the front lines. I remained silent, and Lao Huang also remained silent. The rain outside the window seemed to intensify, hitting the glass like a sad piece of music.</p>
<p>Someone came up the stairs. Lao Huang ran to open the door, but it was the landlord going to the second floor. He seemed greatly disappointed and said to me shyly, "Lao Zhang, let's go out to eat."</p>
<p>I am always very happy to meet old classmates in society because we are from the same era and only we know our suffering, but Lao Huang, who used to run and jump like the wind, has now been reduced to such a weak and timid character. Sitting face to face in this small attic, I felt suffocated.</p>
<p>"Okay," I said, "Then let's go to my house to eat."</p>
<p>"Who else is at your place?" Lao Huang asked apprehensively, turning up his coat collar.</p>
<p>"It's just me and Lao Zhang," I said, patting him on the shoulder and pulling him out.</p>
<p>"You're not married yet?" he murmured to himself.</p>
<p>"Marrying a wife is really undesirable!"</p>
<p>I didn't answer because he blamed all his sins on his wife. We felt our way down the dark stairs.</p>
<h3>Southern Memories</h3>
<p>— Huang</p>
<p>(I) Shantou Night Scene</p>
<p>At night, the sea breeze embraces Shantou, this small southern city.</p>
<p>Dust swirls in the corners of the roads, and the colorful shop signs swell in the wind, making banging noises.</p>
<p>The dazzling streetlights cause the pedestrians to drag long, thin shadows. It is autumn, and the pedestrians shrink, some with their hands tucked into their sleeves, others walking briskly sideways. Night is full of autumnal charm.</p>
<p>After ten o'clock, the shops on both sides of the road close their doors tightly. The unrestrained lights sometimes squeeze through the slats, secretly peeping at each pedestrian. Some dry goods stores and grocery stores remove one slat, and the clerks stick their heads out to watch, making people think of prisoners in jail.</p>
<p>A mournful sound comes from the other side of the street. An old man with a leather drum hanging on his chest walks along, beating the drum as he calls out. The sound of the gong and the rustling of his slippers echo.</p>
<p>"Ji Qiu Mee—!" The seller, with a long bamboo basket on his shoulder, shouts with a drawn-out voice.</p>
<p>"Almond tea—!" A yellow light suddenly flows onto the street. The old man carrying the almond tea stand stops on the street.</p>
<p>"Five cents for almond tea, a piece of sesame candy, two pieces of jujube paste?" Someone holding a small bowl runs out of the store and squats by the stand, saying to him in a familiar tone.</p>
<p>Only the rickshaw pullers slowly walk down the street, holding the rickshaw handles, the sound of the bell floating mournfully in the air, both clear and sad, as if crying. Even they don't get a break!</p>
<p>"X Juan's, if I don't get any more business, the rice jar will have to arrange the Bagua tomorrow."</p>
<p>They complain as they walk past, leaving silence to this main street.</p>
<p>At night, the sea breeze embraces this small city, rushing down its long streets like a majestic lion.</p>
<p>(II) Seaside Scene</p>
<p>When you walk to the seaside in the morning, you can hear the gentle, rustling sound of the tide kissing the shore. Only a few pedestrians walk along the seaside road. Overhead is the vast and bright autumn sky, as blue as the sea, and the sea is as blue as the sky.</p>
<p>Panshi Mountain, opposite Shantou, stands alone in the sea. The morning sun, like soft, gentle hands, caresses the purple rocks on its summit. A seagull circles a few times over the island, then dives into the waves like a falling arrow.</p>
<p>In the distance, a ship enters the harbor, its foreign flag waving. It slowly sails in, unloading a lot of coal ash halfway. The loud sound breaks the silence on the shore. Then, many "foreign guests," as black as the coal ash, are also unloaded. Small boats carry them closer to the pier.</p>
<p>It is a ragged group (they were young when they left home, but now their energy is exhausted, people like coal ash!). Decades of hard work have not brought them happiness, comfort, or enjoyment, only a broken heart, a weakened body, and shattered hopes.</p>
<p>They walk on the road, their heavy steps singing a sad and powerful song.</p>
<p>Where is their home? They have no family, no relatives, nothing to fill their hungry stomachs. Where are they going?</p>
<p>The tide kisses the shore, making a gentle, rustling sound. The seaside returns to its original silence. The scene is as it was, but what about the people? They are old and exhausted.</p>
<p>"These people like coal ash!</p>
<h3>Hunger</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>When I came out of the Beijing Library and walked down the marble steps, my eyes were dizzy, and many bright little stars circled in front of me. When I walked, my feet seemed to be floating. I knew very well that this was not because I had overworked my brain, but because I was too hungry. I hadn't eaten anything from nine in the morning until now, so no wonder.</p>
<p>As soon as I walked out of the library gate, I saw the cars speeding back and forth, and my head became even more dizzy. Looking at the dazzling streetlights, I thought blankly:</p>
<p>"Where should I go to get a meal?"</p>
<p>I felt my pocket, and there was nothing in it except a pencil and a handkerchief. If I had four copper coins at this time, that would be great. Many freshly baked sesame cakes were steaming on the sesame cake stall, and the smell of sesame and yellow sauce rushed straight into my nose, and I couldn't help but drool.</p>
<p>"Where should I go to get a meal?" The faces of many friends living in apartments appeared in front of me. Couldn't they order an extra meal and invite me? But I immediately dismissed this thought, because I saw those angry faces. Scrounging is not a long-term solution. Occasionally, one or two meals can be tolerated.</p>
<p>My head felt like it was carrying hundreds of pounds of goods, and it became heavier and heavier. It also became more and more tiring to walk on the street with floating feet. Looking at the long street rolling with yellow dust, it seemed to be several thousand miles, several hundred miles</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>long, and it seemed that I would never finish walking.</p>
<p>"Where should I go?" I asked blankly as I walked blankly. The sky became darker and darker. There were many people walking on the long street. The radio was broadcasting many beautiful tunes, but I didn't pay attention to anything. I just kept looking at the purple lamb intestines, orange-yellow cornbread, and white Shandong pancakes on the small stalls by the road. It would be the happiest thing if I could take a bite. In this way, I even became jealous of the rickshaw pullers sitting on the short stools at the stalls.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I remembered that I had a watch in my pocket, which was naturally my last and most valuable asset. In this way, I became happy. I searched for the black character "当" on the white wall, and my pace quickened unconsciously.</p>
<p>Finally, I walked into a pawnshop with great hope. As soon as I opened the cloth curtain, the eyes of the shop assistants on the counter dropped my temperature to the freezing point. I carefully took out the priceless watch from my pocket and slowly placed it on the high counter, then asked in a low voice:</p>
<p>"How much money can this watch be pawned for?" I looked at the expressions of the shop assistants.</p>
<p>"How much do you want to pawn it for?" He fiddled with the hour hand and looked at the back cover, and then asked me like this.</p>
<p>"One yuan." This amount is not much, I thought to myself.</p>
<p>"Hey," he hummed this unpleasant sound from his nostrils, and at the same time put the watch on the counter. Without turning his head, he said, "Pawn it for four cents."</p>
<p>An unnamed anger rushed up. I almost wanted to cross the short栏　on the counter and give him a few heavy slaps. With that mocking attitude, that arrogant language, giving them such high interest, do I still have to suffer such humiliation?</p>
<p>I was about to raise my hand and take back the watch on the counter, but another idea finally prevailed. It made me ask with a patient tone:</p>
<p>"Can you reduce it by one cent? Just pawn it for nine cents!"</p>
<p>"Just give you five cents."</p>
<p>Finally, I left the high counter with five torn mao notes and a pawn ticket. At this time, I was unbearably hungry. I carefully planned that five cents should be used for at least three days, as for what would happen after three days, I couldn't care about it at this time.</p>
<p>Crossing the short stool, I sat down in front of a stall selling Shandong pancakes. At that time, the streetlights were already bright, and it was the time when many college students and young masters were drinking their strong coffee on the楼厅of Mouyuan.</p>

<p>(2) La la la! La la la! I am a little expert in selling newspapers. I run all over the streets in wind and rain. If I don't walk well, I'll slip and bite. My body is covered in cement and people laugh at me. I only know hunger and cold.</p>
<p>(3) La la la! La la la! I am a little expert in selling newspapers. I run all over the streets, enduring hunger and cold. I don't eat enough, I don't sleep well. Who can I tell about my painful life? One day, light will come!</p>

Therefore, he is sitting idle, eating away his fortune until it's all gone. Look at him. Walking in the wind and rain, begging. Still happily walking the streets. Walking in the market, it's really lively. Laughing at people who are lost in dreams. Saying what? Your family has millions of wealth. Not as good as my humble self. Saying what? Money is originally an external thing. I ask your family. Can you possibly take it with you after death? I think you all, harm your children and grandchildren, fighting over inheritance. Can you be at peace beneath the nine springs? I am, drinking today's wine today. Eating tomorrow's rice tomorrow. Passing the time without worry. I think you all, working hard like cattle and horses all day long. Not letting go of any desire for profit. You should know, that for money, you suffer accidents. Once robbed, you are injured. Why give up a life? I am, after hearing the good-for-nothing's words. It makes people feel a hundred emotions. I think the world. Certainly dies for profit and desire. Who can escape the gate of right and wrong? Some are, greedy without restraint, their consciences are bad. Some are, fighting for power and profit, not letting others. Some are, happy to show off their wealth in front of others. Some are, pursuing spending thousands of gold at a time. These are all, drunk, dreaming,纨绔 sons. Spending money like dirt, fools. They don't think, that blood and sweat are not easily obtained. Your ancestors and fathers exhausted their efforts. Relying on you to recklessly waste it. Laughing at people who are lost in dreams. You should know, one tael of gold is four taels of fortune. I think you, your cheap bones are not worthy of being the God of Wealth. You can only, seek a life in the northwest wind. Live a life in the alley. The foolish Third Young Master is originally three things, rotten wood, difficult to carve. Don't listen to the foolish, blind enthusiast.</p>

<h3>Two Monsters in "The Boatwoman"</h3>
<p>(1) The Fox Fairy Xu Lai</p>
<p>Xu Lai, this beautiful person, plays a very thrifty and lively "boatwoman" in "The Boatwoman". Every day, she and her old father row a boat in the misty West Lake. When the sun rises and dusk envelops the lake, Lao Gao, this young worker, comes to replace them when they are breathless and sweating on this beautiful lake.</p>
<p>Every morning and evening, Lao Gao's going to work and getting off work are their only companionship.</p>
<p>Xu Lai felt Lao Gao's sincerity, and the seeds of love had sprouted unknowingly. At night, under the faint stars, she secretly ran to Lao Gao's window. At this time, Lao Gao was mending his torn clothes. Men don't know how to sew. A needle drew blood, which made Xu Lai secretly laugh outside the window. When Lao Gao ran out of the door and hit the barking dog, Xu Lai secretly took out his torn clothes and mended them for him, sending them in the next day when the sky was slightly bright. This made Lao Gao feel strange. Not only that, but his torn socks and the like were often mended without anyone knowing. One day, he returned a little late. When he got home, the rice was cooked, and even the incense in front of his deceased mother's spirit was burned. But this secret was finally discovered by Lao Gao. He said to Xu Lai in surprise, "So it was you! I thought it was a fox fairy?"</p>
<p>This segment, under the direction of Shen Xiling, is extremely interesting, and no viewer fails to laugh until their stomach hurts.</p>
<p>(2) The Madman Lao Gao</p>
<p>There are many young people in this world with enthusiasm and a sense of justice, whose behavior is regarded as madness by people of leisure. When Gao Zhanfei in "The Boatwoman" gathers workers to demand the resumption of work at the factory, he is actually arrested by the capitalists and imprisoned. When he is acquitted, however, everything has changed, and the world has gone awry. His dearest Xu Lai and her father have disappeared. At this time, Xu Lai has been forced to become meat on people's chopping blocks, falling into the mire. When he learned this news, he rushed into the brothel. Xu Lai had almost become a living corpse, at the mercy of others. Before his eyes, everything was dark and chaotic, with insane thoughts. He could no longer bear it and destroyed everything in the brothel, shouting, "Break out of hell, this is hell, you are not human, you are all man-eating jackals, I want to break this hell!"</p>
<p>So he was arrested again and imprisoned, and the next day, the news section of the newspaper carried "Madman Rampages in Brothel."</p>
<p>A family is being mischievous: because Qin Tong despises Wang Yin the most, but Yuan Meiyun insists on falling in love with him.</p>
<p>--This is a scene from "Wedding Night"</p>
<h3>Prelude to "A Hero of the Times"</h3>
<p>The all-dialogue, sound-singing blockbuster "A Hero of the Times," which is about to meet the long-awaited world in the top theaters in this and other cities, is the latest, greatest, and most valuable product of Yihua Company. It is also the most artistically valuable, most socially significant, and most honorable contribution that Ying Yunwei and other technicians and artists have made with a year of painstaking effort. It is like a bomb, destroying all obstacles in Chinese cinema, and like a clap of thunder, raising the technical level of Chinese cinema.</p>
<p>"A Hero of the Times" is a problem play. It starts from the First World War and goes all the way to the impending Second World War. Using sharp techniques, it depicts the ups and downs of the Chinese economic market, and even more so, with the technique of profiting seven, it dissects the struggle between Chinese capital and international capital and the impact on Chinese society as a result. In the middle of this, there is the overt and covert struggle of Chinese capital, the opportunistic erosion of international capital, the rampages of warlords, the activities of bankers, and the overbearing behavior of market monks. The development of the plot is extremely varied, and the climax rises and falls like a storm. Therefore, it is indeed a problem drama that is full of great stimulating power, crying out for injustice for the business community, and at the same time a glorious record of raising the technical level of Chinese cinema.</p>
<p>Now, it is about to be released. Here, we sincerely introduce to you this supreme masterpiece "A Hero of the Times," and ask you to give a truthful criticism after watching it. Where exactly is it inferior to imported European and American films?</p>
