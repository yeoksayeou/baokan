<h3>和平有望　停戰談判証實　卽提國聯處理　並須得阿皇同意　法意英正在接洽　教皇代表亦幹旋</h3>
<p>（倫敦）倫敦政界承認意法政府己交換終止意阿戰爭之試騐的建議，又承認十月十八日意相墨索里尼與駐羅馬英大使德魯蒙爵士談話時，曾約略涉及此舉之可能性，聞終止意阿戰爭之可能性、迄今僅作非正式之探詢耳、現信探詢終止意阿戰爭之可能性，乃法總理賴伐爾於會晤敎廷公使倫亞沃與意大使塞魯悌時倡議、賴伐爾當時曾提出一種方案、主張以阿國土地一大部分割讓意國、而以英屬紫瑪里之齊拉海口補償阿國、但該海口仍須經過讓與竟國之土地始能達之、第此種辦法距墨索里尼之願望尙遠、然法國今已努力從事和平探詢、且一切行動、均使英政府知之、故一般人士推料墨索里尼所持代管阿比西尼亞全部之要求、今已有所變動矣、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）自巴黎方面發起外交談判、以冀依據英國不管部大臣艾登前于八月間在巴黎會議所提出之建議、及意國擬將阿比西尼亞區分爲本部領士與邊境省份之主張、而覓求解决方案之後、此間官塲人士以爲意國對于此項談判必定加以贊助、并以爲阿比西尼亞問題苟不牽涉歐洲觀念在內、則解决方案當易于覓獲、此外、關于英法意三國最近外交活動情形之情報、頃已傳至阿國蒂格爾省、該處意阿兩國當局聞已開始談判、此間意國當局以爲解决方案、似可在短時期內獲得之、并可在北路前綫暫時休戰狀態終止以前、提交國聯會考慮、至英國駐意大使德魯蒙于星期五日與意相墨索里尼相會晤、事後雖經發表公報、說明經過、但據本社訪員所之內、撤回地中海海軍艦若干艘、意國政府則撤回集中意屬利比亞軍隊一部分、關于此層、意國雖尙未作最後决定、但一般人以爲英國召回軍艦、其事甚易、意國撤退駐紮利比亞部隊、則較爲困難云、（二十一日哈瓦期電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）外傅國聯行政院處理意阿爭端之五國委員會不久卽將恢復解决意阿問題、惟負責方面則否認其說、據哈瓦斯社記者探悉、各國代表團對於五國委員會恢復工作、咸認爲可行、惟必俟目前在倫敦巴黎羅馬三方面所進行之談判獲有滿意結果後、五國委員會方能繼續開會、且凡解决意阿爭端之條件、於提出討論之前、必先徵得阿國政府同意而後可云、（廿日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>意征東菲　財源已漸枯竭　虧耗達萬三千餘萬里拉</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）聯邦儲備局今日報告、意國因東菲戰爭之結果、其財源已漸枯竭云、（廿日國民電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）據財政部發表、結至九月三十日爲止、國庫收支帳項、計九月份一個月、東菲洲臨時支出達六萬三千三百萬里拉、本年七·八·九·三個月合計、則爲十三萬四千五百萬里拉、九月份一個月中、收入共計十六萬一千六百萬里拉、支出共計十七萬四千七百萬里拉、總計財政虧耗達一萬三千一百萬里拉、紙幣流通額、則達一百五十二萬七千三百萬里拉、（廿日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）美聯社記者今日曾向國聯各國代表徵求「制裁能否有效」之意見、據悉多數咸信諸會員國對意實施經濟及財政懲戒之後、不獨對於意國將大有影響、且能使意相墨索里尼之權力完全崩毀云、若干代表預料、意國遠征菲洲、如遭失敗、則墨氏法西斯黨專政之傾覆將爲必然之結果、而其所以傾覆之直接原因將爲日內瓦在經濟上及財政上三方面之「戰爭」、國聯於上星期六所完成之懲戒計劃、逐漸進行、將頗費時日、惟最後當能使意國在經濟上及財政上窒息而後已、經濟專家以爲國聯懲戒之影響、在初期實施之時、意國將無所感覺、因意大利爲高度工業化之國家、能於短時期內自給、且奧匈及阿爾巴尼亞三國皆不參加　裁、瑞士亦略有不願之意、而意國或能自德美日本等國、購買鋼·鉛·油·銅·等等原料、凡此皆足使懲戒之效騐較緩發生、惟一般代表咸承認國聯最有力之一著、在於英國之控制蘇彝士運河、若一旦封鎖、則紅海之入口已斷、將使意國空軍鞭長莫及、固不必在地中海一端作戰也云、（廿日國民電）</p>
<h3>英法合作實行　地中海軍艦調防</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）今日據悉、英法海軍協議、互援之結果、英國已令戰艦胡特號及雷囊號退出地中海、惟法國同時已在地中海增加海軍實力七萬噸、故雙方滴相抵銷云、（二十日國民電）</p>
<h3>德參加制裁說　惟將向索英代價</h3>
<p>（倫敦）晨郵報外交記者頃宣稱、「德國將向英國要索相當補償、作參加對意制裁之代價、以抵補因參加制裁所受之損失、此當係確情、惟此項代價、是否爲金融上之援助、如德國前年之所渴望、欲在倫敦市塲發行德國債券、抑爲外交上之利益、則目前猶未能預測」云、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>阿京　今日此間盛傳、阿代表正在英進行二百萬鎊之信用借欵、以資購買軍械軍火、（二十一日國民電）</p>
<h3>瑞典總理表示　參加集體制度　制裁非仇恨一國</h3>
<p>瑞典京城　國務總理漢生頃發表演說、陳述國際局勢、略謂『對意國實施制裁旣非仇恨一國、亦非反對某種政治制度、蓋僅係表示反對侵略國之態度爲已、此與曩昔比利時侵犯南菲時、瑞典所採取之態度相同、瑞典人民一致認而瑞典必須參加集體行動、以謀恢復和平、瑞典資產階級三政黨之代表、對於在日內瓦之政策、亦均與政府及社會民主黨一致、若以爲應召集衆議院、以核准參加對意制裁之政策、則政府亦不反對』云、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英屬東菲　實施中立法令　強迫意船廿四小時內開行</h3>
<p>奈洛俾　英國東菲屬地政府得倫敦訓令、今日開始實施中立法令、强迫意國船隻、於到埠二十四小時以內、卽須開行、意船塞遜考達號、今日巳被迫開離蒙拔薩、未能裝畢運往意屬索馬里之汽油及食品、惟悉此項中立法令、與國聯對意制裁、並無關係、（二十日國民電）</p>
<h3>英下院今日開會　討論外交政策</h3>
<p>（倫敦）下議院定於明日復會、討論關於意阿爭端之外交政策、首相鮑爾溫已於下議院開會之前、與各閣僚分別會談、今晨并已延見海軍大臣孟寨爾爵士（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德退國聯生效　斷絕一切關係</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）德國退出國聯於今日夜半生效、其與國聯之關係從此完全斷絕、且與日本質脫退有異、蓋德國今已與國聯各種團體、如國聯勞工局、世界法庭、及其他非政治委員會等、槪行斷絕關係矣、國聯下屆選舉行政院理事時、德國之遺缺將由坎拿大遞補、德國退出國聯所引起之最重要問題卽爲西歐和平所繫之洛卡諾公約是否仍舊生效、蓋以該約係以德國加入國聯爲條件也、若干法學專家咸以爲該約於德國退出國聯後仍屬有效云、（二十一日國民電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）自十月二十一日夜半起、德國將正式退出國聯會、按國聯會員國聲明退出、須自聲明以後滿二年、方發生效力、查軍縮會議德國代理首席代表萊茵巴登於一九三三年十月十四日宣佈、已奉政府命令、同時退出國聯會及軍縮會議、但德國政府退出國聯會之正式通知書、則係於一九三三年十月二十一日送出、故核算日期、於明日夜半、德國始實行退盟、因此國聯會行政院爲德國代表所設之一席、卽將於後日實行撤除、至日本之一席、則已於本年二月間撤除矣、按德國於一九二六年二月十日請求加入國聯會、是年二月召集國聯非常大會、未獲通過、後至一九二六年十月十日始宣佈加入國聯會、總計德國加入國聯會、先後共歷九年、德國退出國聯會後、同時亦退出國聯勞工局、該局理事會、現將於本星期內開會、選定德國所任國際勞工局理事一席之繼任者、查國際勞工局原任理事加拿大、最近因美國加入勞工局、故以其理事之一席、讓諸美國、此次德國退出後、大約將以加拿大繼任理事云、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>視察近東　松島返國報告　向廣田有所進言</h3>
<p>（東京）日外務巡閱使松島大使、十九日公畢返日、今日十一時訪廣田外相、報告視察情况、對於所得結果、向廣田外相有所獻策、松島巡閱使之意見云、（一）印度及近東各地方之新國家運動、日方應特別注意、决定恒久之對策、（二）巴黎斯丁各地、應新設駐外公館、擴張通商與貿易、（三）從速確立輸出統制之總機關、（二十一日華聯電）</p>
<h3>意絲傾銷日商恐慌</h3>
<p>（東京）據日產業界息、意國因要籌備軍事、决取生絲傾銷政策、凡對外輸出之意絲市價、决比日絲减收一成、决與日絲爭奪市塲、以此代價買軍用品、因此日絲界已起大恐慌、日蠶絲界因此所受之損失甚巨、（二十一日華聯電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>停戰聲中之英法合作問題</h3>
<p>— 昻</p>
<p>英法意三國間日來頗有外交上之接洽。其最堪注意者。爲墨索里尼與英大使。英外相霍爾興意大使。分別晤談緩和地中海局勢問題。倫敦羅馬並於上星期日同時再發彼此並無敵意之聲明。此種作用。誠如意外部人員所云。僅在表示和解之門未閉。於實際大局。可謂並無多大關係。蓋英無單獨行動之意。本爲九月十一日霍爾外相向國聯大會宣言之主旨。而意無侵犯英國權利之心。與九月二十八日意內閣公報所載。亦無出入也。</p>
<p>雖然。意爲新興之工業國。其向東菲作軍事冒險之動機。又爲國內之經濟恐慌。故國聯經濟制裁所予之打擊。在目前殊有使意軍欲戰不得之苦。墨索里尼邇來之沉默。可槪見其躊躇之心緒。據最近消息。英法意已在磋商東菲停戰條件。可知意國對於軍事。頗覺難以爲繼矣。</p>
<p>最近英意之稍見接折。爲法海軍允於地中海方面援英一舉所促成。英法合作之必底於成。吾人前已言之。蓋英法之於歐陸。猶之英美之於遠東。合則成。不合則敗。事甚顯然。况英法政策均以國聯爲立塲。不過其對象。在英則爲地中海。在法則爲萊茵河。談判之癥結。卽在如何將此二問題歸納於同一集體制之下耳。法國方面固不願犧牲本年一月間羅馬恊定所樹立之法意親善關係。英國方面。亦不願毀損六月間倫敦海軍協定所促進之英德諒解。英法二國投鼠忌器。合作之議遂呈迂迴曲折之象。然在國聯範圍以內。兩國行動。固亦步亦趨。未嘗稍背也。</p>
<p>茲再就史的觀點。一加考察。則今次英法合作談判。實可視爲歐戰後集體和平制談判之連續。亦卽充實國聯運動之進展。集體保安制原爲法國所馨杳求之而不得者。自一九二〇年英美法三國同盟之議遽歸泡影後。集體運動。如一九二二年之互援草約。及一九二四年之日內瓦議定書。均以英國之不願參加。而功敗垂成。至一九二六年英國所參加之洛卡諾條約。不過集體制中之屬於局部性質者。耳英於保奧獨立一事。雖曾一再與法意發表共同宣言。然猶不願卽允以武力爲其後盾。法國乘上月英外相霍爾向國聯大會宣言之良機。舊事重提。以冀「塡補集體保安制英法間之缺陷。」旋英亦以地中海海軍合作問題向法徵詢。於是月餘間文書往還。至上星期六談判始告一段落。綜其結果。英僅作槪括的答覆。卽恪守全部國聯盟約之義務。此外不願指定特殊問題有所預約。法國亦僅允履行盟約第十六條第三項之消極的互援約束。以此視昔。固已頗見進步。然盟約之眞正實力。乃在關於軍事制裁之第十六條第二項。此則尙有待於試騐之機會矣。</p>

<h3>兩公共汽車衝突事件　責任亟待判明　全運會圓滿閉幕竟有此不幸事件　雙方負責人昨均有中國要談話發表</h3>
<p>—張登義金保賢有引咎辭職說—</p>
<p>全運會一切均在順利中、忽於閉幕之日、發生市辦與商辦公共汽車司機衝突事情、各情已誌昨報、茲據中央社記者採誌續情如下、</p>
<p>市公用局負責人談</p>
<p>據市公用局負責人向記者談、本局以全運會開慕後、往來人數激增、而原有閘北華商公共汽車、不敷應用、爰經本局將滬南公共汽車抽調一部分至閘北服務、不幸於全運閉幕之日、與華商汽車方面發生衝突、市辦汽車方面、除副處長金保賢受傷外、尙有司機售票五人受傷、現金副處長傷勢較輕、暫爲休養、其餘五人、悉行送入瞿直甫醫院療治、中有二人、頗有性命危險、惟此事發生、全出誤會、本局除將經過情形、呈報七級機關外、并望此事勿使擴大、</p>
<p>華商汽車負責人談</p>
<p>復據閘北華商公共汽車公司負責人談、本公司對於此次所發生之不幸事件、殊出於意外、現幸受傷者七人、尙無大碍、經送仁濟醫院療治後、傷勢已漸見輕减、但此次糾紛之發生、責任誰屬、尙待當局作公正之調查、現本公司已將經過情形呈報市公用局、并函知長途汽車公司聯合會主持公道、本公司尤引不安者、因雙方之發生衝突、使乘客受驚、且有累及者、本公司不得不鄭重表示遺憾、將來是非曲直、自有社會公正之判論、尙有一點須待聲明者、據傳本公司曾於是日下午開出客車一輛、載有司機二十餘人、至東體育路附近、將市辦汽車司機售票毆打云云、實係誤傳、蓋當時全體車輛出發、尙有不敷應用之虞、何來有餘車云、</p>
<p>雙方路線恢復原狀</p>
<p>自昨日始、滬南公共汽車管理處、已飭令臨時調往閘北行駛之汽車、仍回滬南原有路綫行駛、而閘北華商公共汽車公司、自閘北至運動塲之車輛、亦已减少、仍恢復行駛原有路綫、故此事當可望不致再有糾紛之發生、而使乘客之威受不安也、</p>
<p>市公用局討論應付</p>
<p>市公用局局長徐佩璜、自前日發生衝突後、卽令主管人員、將闖禍情形、詳爲調查、對於市辦汽車受傷人員、分別送入醫院療治、并於昨日下午、召集臨時緊急會議、討論應付此事之具體辦法、但其辦法、內容究屬如何、局方尙未宣佈、又據記者向某方探悉、此次事件之發生、尙在全運會時期內、故市公用局第四科科長兼全運會交通股股長之張登義、已有引咎辭職之說、而公共汽車管理處副處長金保賢、於闖事之時、適亦在塲、不料造成此空前巨禍、亦已示倦勤之意、</p>

<h3>（點滴）</h3>
<p>— （田舍翁）</p>
<p>世變憶亟，本日大難，雖有英傑，難挽狂瀾，信識隸者，以為下元甲子；抱杞憂者，徙然咄咄畫空，余以為「易，窮則變，變則通，通則久」，此不易之訓也，奚足悲哉！</p>
<p>宋亡於元，明亡於清，莽莽禹域，淪於夷狄者數百年。然皆不久光復舊物，還我河山，今有人以此自慰者，實大謬也。若朝鮮臺灣，非萬刦不復者乎？今昔之勢異，亡國之術苛，國人應如何自救哉？</p>
<p>我國一年老之富孀也；白相人甲，涎其富，而誘惑之。又恐白相人乙丙之染指，視同禁衡，喫醋威脅，無所不至。甚矣，此年老富孀處境之　也！</p>
<p>曠觀中外史鑑，亦可見興亡成敗之因矣；朝野上下，宜如何自勉哉！</p>
<h3>先棉祠</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>瞧了瞧身上穿的棉布，便連帶着想起首先在上海播種棉花的黃道婆來。</p>
<p>黃道婆是元末時候的人，伊的老家是住在上海的烏泥涇。伊在閩廣一帶住了好些時，一瞧見那邊的土人，都會種棉紗織布，偷偷的把方法學會着。等到回到上海，還帶了不少棉的種子來，除了自己種植外；還把種子分給別人；也把紡織的方法教給着。這樣一來，四鄕的婦女都會紡織了。這倒了慢替婦女們找着一種生產的工業，功勞着實不少咧，後人不忘伊的功澤，便造了一所先棉祠來紀念伊。</p>
<p>不過我瞧到某書局出版的教科書上，說到先棉祠現已荒廢，無從查考，這卻有些不對。按先棉祠在上海西門內龍門書院的後邊，大殿一廡，庭中帶種着四侏梧桐，殿的正中，塑着慈眉善眼的金身法相，便是這功被蒼生的黃道婆了。兩旁還塑兩個侍女，小心翼翼地侍立着。後來那龍門書院改作師範學校，因校舍不敷，便把這祠址圈進，不過大殿神像，絲毫未加毀損。在殿前造了幾間平屋，作為學生們的養病室；正殿權充了病人飯堂；兩旁的餘屋，給校役居住，這樣一來，祠與外間隔絕，便不大給人知道和接觸了。到了民國十六年後，那師範學校校舍，改作了省立上海中學初中部，那祠宇卻仍舊劃入學校勢力圈內。去年上海中學遷入新校舍後，將原有校址全部拍賣去，那先棉祠當然也包括在內。不過有一部護古人士，提議把先棉祠劃出，修理保管，不知是否實行呢</p>
<h3>上場詩</h3>
<p>— 馮摩尼</p>
<p>凡是在社會上做事的人，都得要懂上場詩，什麼叫做上場詩呢？就是遇見了朋友瞎纏二官經的寒暄一番，所謂敷衍，也就是上場詩。</p>
<p>兩個人見了面，像啞子般的默不作聲，固然不好，所以一定要有上場詩來敷衍；不過有些人以上場詩來敷衍，未免滑稽。譬如：一個人往糞坑上去出恭，遇見了熟識的人，便是這麼說：「你出恭」！那個人回答的話是「你也是出恭啊！」因為都要出恭，都到糞坑裏來，決沒有這種空暇的人，沒事往糞坑裏去嗅木穉香，而且沒有這種好胃口的人，這種上場詩的敷衍，似乎太幽默了。</p>
<p>還有些人，往澡堂裏去洗澡，瞧見朋友赤裸裸躺在塌上，徧徧還是以上場詩來敷衍說道：「何是淴浴」？（吳語）細細一想，真要笑煞外國人，世界沒有天字第一號的獃子，澡堂當做博物館似的欣賞古董，這種上場詩的瞎敷衍，真是要不得的。</p>
<p>上場詩這句話，因為戲院裏的角兒出場，沒有走出卞唱戲的，先打引子，然後坐定下來，唸四句詩，這叫做上場詩，今人都以為和人開頭說話爾曰上場詩了。</p>
<p>我是不會瞎敷衍，而且不諳上場詩的奧妙，瞧見了朋友我卻反而上場暈，就是我懂了瞎敷衍的上場詩，還是說不出口來，實在太沒意義的空話。</p>
<h3>鎻鑰</h3>
<p>— 涓隱</p>
<p>門雖設而常關</p>
<h3>同是屋頂</h3>
<p>— （醉樵）</p>
<p>都市裏的人，好像對於平地生活過厭了，於是就興起屋頂花園，屋頂舞廳，屋頂電影場，屋頂酒排間，一般紅男綠女，都在屋頂上逍遙快樂；但是再轉看到災區的慘狀，無數哀黎，屋頂待援，屋頂露宿，屋頂悲號，那平地白浪掀天，欲下平地而不可得，相形之下，同是屋頂，一則金迷紙醉；一則慘目傷心！希望都市裏的人們，在屋頂追歡取樂，就得想到災區屋頂上的難民，慨然解囊去救濟，那真功德無量了！…這是揚州評話家王少堂，在華東電臺報告我們聽的；同時，我還希望各電臺，都能照樣宣傳！</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第二十回　掙命看嬌孫抱頭落淚荒年憶往事種麥招殃</p>
<p>這便向他們笑道：有什麼事，讓你的姑娘，慢慢兒的和我說罷。說着，掉過臉來向月英道：你只管說。也許我可以帮你一點忙。月英向祖母看看，因道：奶奶，你就在那床上躺一會子，我們出了錢把這屋子租下，在今天一天，這屋子裏什麼東西，都是我們的了。朱胡氏走近前去，扶着他道：娘呀！你身子不大好，你就躺下罷！朱老太隨了兒媳扶着，身子向下倒去，手撐了床心的藤繃子軟沉沉的，嚇抓了朱胡氏的衣服，又坐了起來。月英道先不要緊的，你躺下就舒服，那像我們土窰裏的坑哇！周太太道：你不管他們了，你說你的。月英見祖母已經是躺下了，母親坐在床沿上，於是先歏了一口氣，向周太太道：我們也并不是賣兒賣女的下賤人家呀。我們在甘肅種着地，養着牲口，也過的是很太平的日子。我的爹，才三十八歲，就丟了我們去了。朱胡氏聽一說他丈夫，立刻兩行眼淚猶如兩條水晶粗綫？直墜下來。哽咽着道：他那是丟了我們去了呀！他是大兵抓去了，活活的弄死啦。月英繃着臉子道？娘子你怎麼這樣不懂事，這位周太太…說着眼珠帶了恐怖的樣子，兀自向周太太望着。周太太笑道：不要緊的，我又不是大兵，你只管說，就算我是大兵，你說的那個大兵，也不見得是我，我怪你作什麼？有什麼話，你只管說。（三四五）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>第三十五章　異兆</p>
<p>這一年的深秋，委實是一個令人永遠不能忘記的特殊的季節。當九月過後，日曇漸漸的短了，各種樹木上的葉子開始在脫落了；我人帝一羣久居在聖宮內的人，對於每個季節的更換原是不甚注意的，但這一次卻都發生了一種異樣的感覺。雖然沒有人能够明白地說出為的是什麼緣故，可是大家的確是那樣感覺着，尤其是太后自己。也許可以說：到深秋時節，天氣漸漸冷了，人們的皮膚上自然會有一種不同的感覺，因此連心內上了也起了相當的反應；這個解釋似有理，但深秋的大氣我們決非出生第一次遇到，何以往年毫無影響，獨自今年突然有起這種感覺來呢？而且這種感覺的刺激性非常的尖銳，竟使我們終日惴惴然好像大患難，大恐怖不久便要臨頭的樣子。然而各人也祇是這樣暗暗擔心而已，誰也不敢在言語上有所表示。</p>
<p>直至這件事發生，我們才知道我們的心悸竟是最靈驗的預兆！</p>
<p>這件事究竟如何開塲的呢？我到事後才追憶岀來。</p>
<p>上苑裏的花木中，木蘭（即玉蘭）原算不得什麼奇異的名種，但也有好幾十株培植着，每逢初夏時，總得開放出許多花朶來；祇　因它們并沒有怎樣的特色，所以我們也向不注意。到了暮春時節，我們是更不會輕易向它們看一眼了。（四四一）</p>
<p>拉雜話</p>
<h3>市招續談</h3>
<p>— 嚴芙孫</p>
<p>滬西有一家雜貨鋪，取名「勃郎林」，可算奇特。據我所知，廣東路石路口，有一家潮州茶食店，亦名「勃郎林」，遙遙相對，無獨有偶。閘北寳興路，還有一家餅乾店，招牌喚做「轟天雷」。曹家渡還有一家已經閉歇的洗衣作，取名「一口劍」離奇怪誕，不可思議，簡直令人莫明其妙了。</p>
<p>幾年前，閘北還鬧一件笑話，竟有一家錫箔莊，幾有魯目之嫌。而該莊門口，忽而樹立一塊新市招，上書「上海冥國銀行鈔票發兌處」十一個大字。上海直轄於冥國，冥國寄生於上海，像這樣人鬼交通的金融機關，五百年後，也許有實現的一天。畢竟時代不同，大家認為出現得太早，官廳一怒，而冥國銀行宣告清理。所謂鈔票也者，至今沒有兌現，恐怕都已化作一炬，和錫箔共成灰爐了。</p>
<p>上海旅行社林立，其命名形形色色，不勝縷舉。其中較有意義的，以我的眼光，認為有下列兩家。一為二馬路的「源源」，取着其來不竭的意思。即通俗，又雅致。一為三馬路的「香賓」，（近始閉歇，）跑馬大香檳，人人腦海中，已有深刻的印象。現在把香檳二字，諧音作為香賓，已算雋妙，而雛賓又都是吃香的人物，閑村古風有句云：「賓至如香醴」，是香賓二字，更入詩境，那就格外覺得够味了。</p>
<p>上海的典肆和押店，在全國的統計中，要算打破最多的紀錄。走出大街小巷，到處可和「尚」「田」先生會面。典肆的取名，以「兩濟」和「兩宜」兩塊招牌，來得最為確切。把利人利已的原則，可以兼顧得到。閘北有一家小押鋪，縣着一塊「民生」的金字招牌，顯然是取着救濟民生而暗示調劑金融的意義。命意固未可厚非，但是民生的要素，完全要仰伏着尚田先生當做生活之源，暫時幸「生」，終乃趨「死」。果然在一二八之役中，敵方鐵島的毒彈，把那塊整個的民生招牌炸碎了。</p>
<p>上海還有一種奇異的中招，闊不滿五寸，長不滿一尺。看上去渺乎其小，而它的誘惑性，任何市招，再也比上。這類小小的市招，依着物以類聚的公式，像鱗次櫛比般的，或在羣玉清和之坊，或在福致勤之里。奇異市招之所謂奇，往往是洋場才子心血的結晶。我曾走馬看花，注意到三張艷幟。一為「奇俠」，一為「虫二閣」，一為「非非」。這幾個命名，彷彿是商店市招上「勃郎林」「一口劍」一般的詭秘。它的取義，經過我搜索枯腸，方纔一鼓成擒，無一漏綱。原來「奇俠」二字，用我的葫蘆測字的破解法，拿來解剖。剛剛化作「大可夾人」四個字，絕紗好辭，可謂惡毒。「虫」「二」二字，疑是風月無邊的象徵，亦有奇趣。令人噴茶的。要算「非非」這兩個字的文虎捲簾稍了。「非非的謎底，便是「想入」。連貫而成一句，便是「想入非非」了。想入非非的人，真好算是想入非非了。我想「非非」女士，讀了這一篇妙文，一定要哭笑不得。</p>
<p>末了！鄙人還要附帶聲明一句，鄙人靠着鬻文賣卜為生，所手創的戎蘆測字，垂簾迄今，恰巧十年。葫蘆問題，設在新世界飯店，只此一家，并無分出。最近有港友函告香港也有「嚴鞭孫葫蘆測字」，并且還聲明出滬到港，其實鄙從從未離滬，香港的嚴鞭蓀，當然另有其人。司馬相如，名相如，實不相如。鄙人不敢掠人之美，因承港粵的親友，親懷垂詢，附帶作一個答復。又本埠曹家渡，也有「嚴芙蓀測字」。（孫字上面，加了一個草頭，這是異點）。南陽橋更有「小葫蘆測字」，都和鄙人風馬無關，唉！可憐呵！文丐吃飯之難，我真不忍再寫下去了。</p>

<h3>全運大會昨更正　男游泳女網球名次　男網球未更正謂有相當理由　獎品俱已領去重裝一份發給</h3>
<p>六屆全國運動大會所發表之男女網球及男子游泳、名次與得分、均有錯誤、昨日本報已代為更正、游泳得分與女子網球名次、經此發覺、昨已決定加以更正、惟對於男子網球之名次、則謂并無錯誤、因大會自有大會之見解與理由也、</p>
<p>更正男游泳名次</p>
<p>本會昨正式公布更正之男子游泳得分、由中央社發出通告如下、本屆全運大會男女游泳分數、結算上、略有錯誤、大會紀錄股、茲特更正如左、</p>
<p>男游泳　女游泳</p>
<p>廣東　五十七分　得錦標　廣東　六十二分　得錦標</p>
<p>香港　五十分　得亞軍　香港　四十分　得亞軍</p>
<p>馬來亞　卅一分　得第三　廣西　十五分　得第三</p>
<p>上海　十二分　得第四　南京　三分　得第四</p>
<p>據上更正、男子組游泳總分第四為上海、前誤為廣西、故男子部總錦標上海、應得二十七分、而廣西無分、</p>
<p>更正女子網球名次</p>
<p>女子網球名次錯誤、亦先經本報發覺、第四名應為四川而非馬來亞、在調查紀錄之後、四川得女子雙打第三、馬來亞第四、故第一山西、第二上海、第三南京、第四應為四川、已通知獎品股補送四川獎品一份、馬來亞早已領去也、男子游泳亦補送上海一份、因被銀樓發給廣西去矣、</p>
<p>男子網球名次理由</p>
<p>至於男子網球之名次、大會之理由、述之如下、是否公正、姑且不論、據云網球錦標之定奪、一單位之名次如何、須視其在單雙打中之成績如何、須單雙打并佳、四川單雙打俱得第四名、而馬華僅得雙打第三、單打無名次、故四川應居馬華上也、照此說法、如果一單位得單打第一、另一單位得兩個第二、錦標應屬後者、馬華此一分、關係總錦標名次、牽涉太多、恐亦未便更正也、</p>
<p>錯誤在總報告更正</p>
<p>大會成績報告之錯誤、決定在總報告中更正、昨紀錄股發出消息云、大會各項成績紀錄、因時間匆促、其中容或有錯誤發生、更正不易、故大會正式結果、應以大會總報告為準云、</p>
<h3>全運審判委員會昨議　滬京兩抗議案　京抗議滬選手衛鼎彝　議決兩案須再行調查</h3>
<p>全運會中、上海市抗議南京市選手楊純福·參加兩單位預選、審判委員會曾一度開會、決議進行調查、茲悉照片已由鎮江寄到、審判委員會昨日在全運總幹事室召集會議、由王正廷代理主席、同時京市亦提出抗議謂滬市男排球選手衛鼎彝、亦曾參加蘇預選、請求取銷資格、審判委員商議結果、以案尚須進行調查、如大會籌備委員會結束、將調查所得呈報教育部核準、</p>
<h3>算算全運總賬　打破全國紀錄者共十九起　尤以女子為佳共破十三項</h3>

<h3>小男兒（七一）</h3>
<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>「呀，那裏話來！」裴媽媽忙着說道，「我便愛這件事自從有了這一大堆的孩子以後，我是最快樂的了，你知道，茀力子，我對於南恩有深切的同情，因為我自己當時也是那麼一個頑皮的孩子，所以我是知道一切的。她精神勃勃，只要教他怎樣去使用這些精神，便可以像小梅一樣的好。照她的穎悟與機敏，她對於功課亦必是喜歡的。假如我們能够恰當地利導，那末現在一個終天嬉耍的小虫也許不久要成為一個忙碌而又快樂的孩子。我知道怎樣管教她，因為我記得我的敬愛的先母怎樣管教的，還有末　」</p>
<p>「是的，她自從她母親死後，在家裏竟無法無天，她是那麼一個聰明的孩子，若被僕人們寵壞了，也就未免太可惜了。我着眼在她也已有不少的時候，那天我在鎮上遇見了她的父親我就問他為什麼不送她上學校去。他說他也很願意，假使他能够找到一個女學校，能有我們的男學校一般的好，因此我知道他必樂於送她上這裏來的；我們今天下午何妨趕了車上他那兒去一趟，看看他的意見到底如何。」</p>
<p>「你還不够煩惱嗎，我的蜀，卻還要去招進一個小精怪來？」裴先生說道，一面拍拍放在他肩上的那個手。</p>

<h3>自然描寫（上）</h3>
<p>— 屈軼</p>
<p>在文學作品里，自然描寫，歷來是看作很重要的。古人所謂：「山林皐壞，實文思之輿府。」就是這個意思。但爲什麼在文學作品里一定要有自然描寫呢？那理由也早有人說過：</p>
<p>「春秋代序，陰陽慘舒，物色之動，心亦搖焉。蓋陽氣萌而元駒步，陰律凝而丹烏羞，微虫猶或入感，四時之動物深矣。若夫珪璋挺其惠心，英華秀其淸氣，物色相召，人誰獲安。是以獻歲發春，悅豫之情暢；滔滔孟夏，鬱陶之心凝；大高氣淸，陰沉之志遠：　雪無垠，矜肅之慮深。歲有其物，物有其容：情以物遷，辭以情發。一葉且或迎意，虫聲有足引心。况淸風與明月同夜，白日與春林共朝哉。是以詩人感物，聯類不窮；流連萬象之際，沈吟視聽之區，　氣圖貌，旣隨物以宛轉；屬朵附聲，亦與心而徘徊。……」</p>
<p>這就是說人生活在自然里，時時要受自然的感應。文學是人們感情的抒發；故無論如何，免不了自然的描寫。但在這里有二點，値得注意。其一，是屬於人與自然的關係。其二是：自然描寫的方法。郎人對於自然的關係，是人隸屬於自然的：是自然的奴隸，是隨目然之年動而變動的。至自然描寫的方法，則是使自然有情化。歷來文人，對於自然的態度和表現的方法，差不多都站在這種同一的立塲上。</p>
<p>人與自然的關係，大概有好幾個時期。最初是混混噩噩與自然渾同的：是屈服於自然的。接着，鑽穴取火，構木爲巢，才知道了利用自然，克服自然。但自工具日益精進以來，人就知道進而創造自然。本來，人類的幸福，全應建築在創造自然上。人類的歷史底終極目的，是呌人們，鞏趨於與自然鬥爭的目標下。但歷來文人，都是不事生產的寄生蟲，所以他們不但不能發揮克服自然創造自然的力量，且還不能在自己身上——人類的能力上——發現有這種力量。所以文人就成爲人類中最軟弱的人；黃仲則詩：「仙佛茫茫兩未成，祗知獨夜不平鳴：風篷　盡悲歌氣，柳絮沾來薄倖名；十有九人堪白眼，百無一用是書生；莫因詩卷愁成識，春鳥秋蟲自作聲，」可說寫盡文人的無能了。尤其以春鳥秋蟲，比喻文人，理爲確當。</p>
<p>自然對於詩人的襲擊，詩人是永遠不敢回手的，而且也無法回手。所以連詛咒之聲也沒有體到。自然　詩人面前是無限的偉大，神秘。自然即是神。本來在自然經濟時代，農民們雖然能利用自然，部分地克服自然，改變目然，但一到自然發揮其最大的權力的時候，（如風暴與水旱等等），却也祇能興仰屋之歏，而莫可如何了。拜物敎存在於農民社會里那是無足爲奇的。屈原的九歌，據說是楚國民間用以祀神的歌謠，不過經厘原潤澤過而流傳下來的。統觀道九歌所表現的，全是贊美自然的靈異與神祕。帶有拜物敎的思想的。如山鬼中云：「若有人兮山之阿，被薜荔兮帶女蘿。旣含睇分又寗笑，子慕予兮善窕窈。乘赤豹兮從文狸，辛夷車兮結桂旗；被石處兮帶杜衡，折芳聲兮遺所思。」又如少司命云：「荷衣兮蕙帶，條而來兮忽而逝。夕宿兮帝郊，君誰須兮雲之際。與汝遊兮九河，衡飈起兮水揚波；與汝沐兮咸池，晞汝髮兮陽之河」。又如湘夫人云：「聞佳人兮召予，將騰駕兮偕遊。築室兮水中，葺之今荷蓋；荃壁兮紫壇播芳椒兮成堂；桂楝兮蘭撩，辛夷楣兮藥房。罔薜荔兮爲帷，擗蕙　兮旣張。白玉兮爲鎭，疏石蘭以爲芳。芷葺兮荷屋，繚之兮北衡。合百草兮實庭，建芳馨兮廡門；九盛繽兮並迎，虛之來兮如雲。」這些都是極意雕塑自然的神靈與偉大的。並將字宙間最美麗的事物，掇擷攏來，以形容自然的人格之高潔與芬芳。在其根底里，實存有拜物敎的思想，目遼十分濃厚。</p>
<p>人在自然前面，旣感到自己能力的渺小。於是發生了崇拜自然的思想。崇拜自然的結果，便想學一學自然，以求其闊大。返眞還撲的道敎思想，在這裏有了根底。但道敎所求的闊大，祇是一種精神勝利，不是實際的闊大。他們想脫離了人間，循「自然的法則」孤獨地在這自然裏活下去，與自然永存。雖然活得下去，活不下去，是一個問題。但人呌這類人是神仙，或仙人。也許有的人這麼地活不下去，悄悄地餓死了。但偏有人呌他成仙子。且還有人作了詩贊美他，追慕他；詩曰：</p>
<p>「翡翠戲蘭苕，客色更相鮮。綠蘿結高林；蒙籠蓋一山。中有冥寂士，靜嘯撫淸弦。放情陵霄外，嚼藥挹飛泉。赤松臨上遊，駕鴻乘紫烟。左挹浮丘袖，右拍洪崖肩；借問蜉蝣輩，寗知龜鶴年。六龍安可頓，運流有代謝。時交感人思，已秋復願夏。淮海變微禽，吾生獨不化。雖欲勝丹谿，雲螭非我駕。愧無魯陽德，廻日向三舍。臨川哀年邁，撫心獨悲吒。（郭漢遊仙詩）</p>
<h3>澗浴</h3>
<p>— 姚慕</p>
<p>我很喜歡水，一痕的小溪，一泓的池塘，都引起我難名的歡悅，尤其是在山嶺歷碰到潺湲的澗水，或飛濺的水潭，彷彿在靜穆的夜裏聞着七紘琴的逸響，莊嚴如女神前看到雙渦的淺笑，我特別感到神往。</p>
<p>記得童時第一回旅行，就是到以飛水潭著名的鼎湖山上，那里的翠綠的潭水，迸瀉的長瀑，扶疎帶拂的高樹，至今猶縈洄我的心曲。像初戀的花絮那樣，我實在把山泉的幽緲之趣理想化了。</p>
<p>今年我們的山居附近本有黃龍潭的瀑布之勝，我曾到過兩回，可惜都不是在雨後泉發的時候。但是坐在一片羊脂似的石灘上頭，看淸湛的寒泉自亂石雜樹間流出，蜿蜒洄蕩于石　石穴間，水聲滿耳。揷足入水，掬水洗臉，暑氣倦意都給那一股冰凉的快感消滌盡了。憑着萬壽橋頭下眺，才見一匹瀑布從压頭下落，銀絲冰屑，一瀉數十丈，凝爲古玉似的碧潭。兩旁石壁峭立，也有流泉的痕跡，豪雨剛過後萬壑爭流的壯觀，可想像出來。壁上舖着青苔，倒乖着藤本的小樹，和蘭芷似的　草，著了飛濺的水花，埋鮮澗欲滴，有數朵　黃的金針化在草樹業中招　着，益日嫵　，水光泉　之外，軍有　般的草色花香。置身其間，像是啜着千年的醇醪，物我都忘，又像是升登凈土，身上心上一塵也染不到。</p>
<p>我們在山中也曾一度遷居，離新居一里便有一道山澗，即裏寒泉激瀉，亂石積疊，景物淸幽像是柳柳州小品中的境界。我們路過的時候，已覺到那是一個洗澡的好去處。到後的第二天，晌午，便和老張携着浴具和待洗的衣裳到那裏去。過了幾處人家，據開豐草埋着的小路，轉了幾個灣，便聞琤琮的泉響，循着水聲再走下幾步，就看見山澗。</p>
<p>雨下過後沒有幾天，澗水還不小。石大小不一，縱橫錯落。依着石的體勢，有些地方洄游激蕩，有些地方　成小潭，有些地方奔瀉如小瀑布。兩厓斜植着梨樹和一些不知名的大葉樹，枝葉交义銉綜，構成天然的棚架，甚至把澗遮過。高高的太陽從枝葉的間隙下窺，圓影在潭中幌蕩。隨着水的深淺，和日光的明暗，水呈着蒼碧淺綠，微黃，雪白，種種的顏色，但都一樣的淸湛冰凉。</p>
<p>先我們到的已有兩個年靑的女孩，正蹲在澗邊洗衣服。我們先脫了靴，以不熟練的姿勢，從這石跳到那石，從低處扳上轟處，把澗的周遭相度一下。然後把帶來的衣服胡亂的洗　一過掛在有陽光的石上晾起來。待女孩們去後，我們　揀深　　開朗的地方做我們的浴塲。水深剛過膝，初揷足時感到遍體生凉，幾要發抖。擦了一會便覺得好了。我有時全身躺在水裏，有時俯着背讓那瀉流的泉水冲激，有時坐在石上以足撥水。一半兒洗澡，一半兒玩。無掛無礙日來的煩膩巳不知消歸何處了！</p>
<p>澗水浴後，我們揀一塊床一般的巨石臥下，再作太陽浴。陽光忽收了，雨跟着　起的凉風落下來，雨料打着樹葉的簌簐聲跟淙淙的泉聲相和。我們穿好衣服，躱在密葉底十，一會，雨便收了，太陽再出來，浴過雨的山澗，更饒蒼潤之意。</p>
<p>我也曾作過神種的沐浴，悶人的蒸汽浴不必說了，——假如容我拿女人來做比喻的話——溫泉浴像是一個濃情密意的　婦，海水浴像是一個豐容盛　，儀態萬方的少女，而澗水浴却有「天寒翠袖　，日暮倚修竹」的風致。嘗過澗水浴的人們當不以這個譬喻爲誇張吧？</p>
<p>那幾天恰是月明的時候，月下的山澗當史幽絕。想像夜凉似水，石凉如冰，樹　橫斜，銀光參錯　灧，口蕩有聲，神話裏所說的　窺　浴的女妖水神，假如眞個有的話，當也在　時此地　　　吧！可惜我浴後的　三天，　下由　，不曾踏　月　來尋　　　　夢境。至今還引這遺憾呢！</p>
<h3>兩種父親</h3>
<p>— 莫孚</p>
<p>法文蒙巴爾扎克有一篇小說——「柯老頭兒」。開頭便這樣寫着：「柯里窩老頭兒，是個發過財的人，很愛他的兩個女兒。因爲要很光榮地出嫁她們，不惜盡　所有分贈給了她們。自己落得很窮苦地流寓在一所學生寄宿舍里，還怕丟她們的臉，不敢去看望。後來病的很沉重，只有同寓的一個少年照應他。少年看出老頭兒漸漸不妥當，急忙叫寓里的僕人去通知他的兩個女兒趕緊前來看視；可是結果只見送信去的人單身走回來。」直到柯老頭見斷了氣，雖然在這中間，那位看護他的少年曾經親自去請他兩個女兒，終未見來。而在柯老頭兒這方面，却老是呶呶不休地喊叫着囈語「……假若我依然還是個有錢的人，仍舊保留着我的財產，不分給她們倆，她們必定來，必定頻頻地吻我的雙頰！……有了銀子就看得見她們了，，……她們竟有鐵石般的心腸……過於愛她們了，所以她以這般對待我。做父親的應該永久是個有錢老……女兒啊！亞萊迭絲，黛芬（他女兒的名字。）！我要見她們。叫巡捕去捉她們來……公道帮助我！天理，國法……都應助我……父親給孩子們蹂躪在脚底下了……」這話彷彿很明白，很理智的，可是他却依然在計劃着怎樣——「去奧地薩做麵片賣……好賺幾百萬銀子……讓她們來，雖然是爲錢財來，也甘心受她們的哄騙……」最後高喊着——「摸摸她們的衣角也是好的……只想摸摸她們的衣角，……可就心滿意足了……我給她們祝福……福……」就這樣死去了。臨終尙爲這樣的兩個女兒祝福，亦眞可謂他愛女兒心切，達到盡致了。</p>
<p>也許會有人以爲這描寫有點過分，實際上不會有這樣的女兒。不錯，這確乎是不十分平常的，在一股人看來，未免殘酷。可是，倘若我們想一想，類乎這樣的事情彷彿隨處都可以遇到，而遇到過，還感到他寫得不够，她們還沒有爲取得老子的財產來同妙謀害，人世間比這更加殘忍的兒女，眞是多得很呢！固然我們對於父母不必尊敬到無理由絕對服從地步，而無錢可得卽置之不理，或爲謀其財，不惜暗下毒手，確是背乎常情。</p>
<p>這是一種溺愛兒女不顧自己生死的父親。柯老頭兒這樣的父親，實在並非特殊，一般父母多是溺愛兒女的，特殊只在這兩個女兒。</p>
<p>因爲這篇小說的關係，使我憶起與此迪然不同的另一種父親。數年前我居住在一個小城市裏。我的房東是一個四十歲左右的退伍軍人。他只有一個孩子，過去家計尙不差，只因閑來無事，染上賭博毛病，不久便將一份家產送盡。可是他對於財產的斷送，並不煩惱，而煩惱的，只在當送掉最後一處住宅時，懷孕四個月的妻爲之一氣而流產：自此以後，七八年間一連流產四次，捉不住胎。他一向主張「多一個兒子，多一份幸福」，對他惟一的兒子，自然不會不愛護。然而他愛子的方法，却全然與柯老頭兒不一——日常吃穿，較好一點的自己獨個享受，讓孩子眼巴巴在一旁觀看。他有一種理由爲自己辯護——孩子能吃穿的時候還長着哩！不止此也，他家敎嚴勵得可怕，雖只是幾歲的孩子，也必須絕對服從，像他對待兵士一樣，毫無理性。於是孩子在他的重壓之下粉碎了。整日裏楞楞怔，老像魂不附體樣子，近乎痴呆。而且他的愛也與柯老頭見兩樣——柯老頭兒的愛，是單純，全然基之於骨肉，談不到什麼目的。可是這另一位正相反，有目的的—指望將來享受兒子賜以幸福，所以不惜以苛刻訓導，鞭撻孩子猛進（？），期達到自己的目的，置孩子自身福利於不顧。其結果如何我們暫不去管它。這種包含別種作用的父愛，着實比柯老頭兒的兩女見對待父親的情腸更要殘酷而不應該。然而這樣的父親在現社會裏，同柯老頭兒一般普遍，隨時隨處可以碰到。</p>

<h3>名譽老婆婆（十二）</h3>
<p>— 江馬修作任鈞譯</p>
<p>某一個秋天的深夜，我家忽然嚮起了一陣　暴的敲門聲。出乎意料之外，敲門的人竟是從警署裏來的。原來剛發見老婆婆已經在市梢的寺廟的院子裏上了吊，警察是來通知的。</p>
<p>我家裏的人們都吃了一驚。因爲這一天老婆婆也仍舊一早就跑到我的家裏來，一直勞作到夜裏才回去。</p>
<p>「噢，那麼，到底眞正地發了瘋呀。近來總覺得她很可笑……可是，因爲老婆婆本來就有可笑的地方，所以，也就沒有十分留意……」</p>
<p>我的母親這麼說着，就聞始念起佛來。</p>
<p>賬房和男僕跑出去了。我因爲想看看可怕的東西。也悄悄地跟着他們跑。是暗黑而寒冷的夜晚。天空裏漫天的小星兒在　着抖。我們都靠着提燈的光，朝着暗黑的市梢急忙地走去。</p>
<p>當我們走到了寺廟裏的時候，老婆婆的屍體已經給解下來了，擺在正殿階下的蓆子上面，屍體上還更用蓆子蓋着。</p>
<p>一個警察和另外的兩兩個人，不時用電燈的光亮的　黑裏把那蓋在蓆子底下的一團照了出來。</p>
<p>我又慌　又害怕。縮成一團，躱在賬房的背後。　　聽了在塲的人們講了一回發見的情形以後，就一聲不響地跑到死屍跟前去。接着，他把蓋着值蘆子悄悄地拉開，謚是，我就從他的背後戰戰兢兢地偷春着。</p>
<p>可驚的事情，就是，老婆婆還是穿着那　　四　　，胸前的　章正在發亮。</p>
<p>我忽然覺得好像聽見她的瘋狂似的聲音：</p>
<p>『這是名譽！這是名譽！』　（完）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>羅斯福子受處罰</h3>
<p>— 家爲</p>
<p>晨　翻閱本報頭一兩張，照例排滿了關於意阿問題的新消息：「阿軍十萬備開則綫，東菲大戰將開始」，「意軍一萬六千繼續開往東菲」，國聯制裁不鬆懈」，「英答覆法政府，地中海艦隊難撤」，「英有封鎖意海岸說……想着那些良稱爲「文明人」的意軍，爲了他們的領袖墨索里尼——林肯第二呢？——他自己是這樣自尊着的——要「征服」那些被認爲「野蠻人」的阿軍跟無辜的婦孺民衆，那樣奮勇地」用着瓦斯毒氣，達姆藥彈去施行大屠殺，在讀者的感覺中，竟得那報端的字裏行間似乎也正充滿着火藥，毒氣與血腥的氣息跟氛圍。</p>
<p>不過，在今日報張的另一角，在這些血腥消息的另一面，我們却又讀到了一節「黃色新聞」的記載。內容照抄如下：</p>
<p>「羅斯福總統之子，因行車過速，今日由法官潘舍斯判處罰金五元，羅氏子現爲哈佛大學三年級生，曾於九月十八日開車速度每小時達六十五英里」，（十八日國民社電）。</p>
<p>「行車過速，罰金五元，」這原是再平常不過的車了，　電訊社却要特地爲牠拍電發稿：而報館編者更爲他加上「花邊」刋載出來，引人注意。當然，這爲的是當事人正是現任美國羅總統斯福之子的緣故吧。</p>
<p>本來，在作老本人，也正不必再來爲他作女官傳。不過，在拋了那些每天讀着的火藥氣的新聞而靜腦想一想，却覺得有幾句話要說的了。</p>
<p>法律，原本是社會的上層建築之」。他是每個社會的規範，卽是個人行爲的準繩，不分什麽地位，也不應有什麽階級。正是「上下無欺，一視同仁」的。然而，正因爲所有社會的上層建築，是得隨着社會的經濟基礎的變易而變易：法律也不能例外。而歷來的社會，却正是上下不平的社會。這樣，法律就此成了統治者們用來壓迫下層羣衆的工具，是成了不可僞飾的事實。</p>
<p>所以，羅斯福子違法受了罰，是那樣平常的一樁小事，要這樣來拍電刋載到世界各報，除去了牠那誇張跟宣傳的成份，在或種條伴之下，是値得人注意的。尤其是今日在我們這個只是以勢利爲事的社會心理狀態之下。</p>
<p>不過，話又要說回來啦，我們想單靠這樣可以來維持現有法律尊嚴，爲示社會的平等，還是不够的。要知在某種塲合，統治者們正有利用了這種方法，來粉飾他們的眞面。所以，要社會太平光明，要法律平等，那非先把我們法律以至其他上層建築所依存的社會基礎，平等了不可！</p>

<h3>包書帶</h3>
<p>— 巖</p>
<p>第三堂的散課鈴響了，劉福高對他的同伴打個眼風。他是級良，站起身來高朗地喊着一二三，敎師挾着書踏出敎室後，像打翻了蜜蜂窠似的課室里頓時零亂起來。各人喊着自己知己的朋友，約着一路走，或者再到什麽地方去玩兒。包書，敲桌板，拋皮球，什麽都是聲音。自然也有幾個斯文的哥兒們，他們有一條漂亮的包書帶；這帶子曾引起同敎室的眼紅，把一疊書，這樣那樣地一扣，就挺穩當地提在手里。走路的時候，提着帶的一端，那疊書就搖呵搖的，和着小皮鞋敲出來的聲音，模樣兒就够漂亮。但是扣這帶子多少要費些時光，那個結一定要扣在一疊書的正中央，否則，走路的時候，牠會碰痛自己的膝蓋兒的。劉福高是級長，學校里獎給他一條帶子，他自然很喜歡地回去在父母面前誇耀，而且在同學面前他也可以搖呵搖的走路了。他的最知已的同坐汪元德就沒有這個，他見了劉福高的包書帶十分眼紅。有幾天散學他都是獨自溜了的。劉福高知道這個，他安慰他：說是學校里私心，汪元德的學問也是很好的，作文都是八十分以上，應該也獎一條包書帶。但是空口白說汪元德總不大高興，兩個兒同路回家的時候，他彷彿見不得人面似的挨着牆壁走。最近三天，散學時劉福高竟找不到汪元德了，級長心里明白，他今天沒有把包書帶搖來。剛才拉了汪元德說：今天我們還是一路走，我不用包書帶了？並且今天還有好看的東西。</p>
<p>所以劉福高打了眼風之後，汪元德故意把薄薄的幾冊書疊了又疊，理了又理，慢慢地展開報紙，像摺手工似的把書包着。那些同學都跳跳蹦蹦地走了，幾個斯文的哥兒們謹愼地把書帶扣在正中，搖呵搖的搖出敎室，他們倆個就伸伸舌頭，和往昔一般親熱地手挈着手，從學校的後門出去。學校後門是一個實弄堂，要多走一條馬路才繞到前門來。但是他們常常這樣走，他們要走得慢，避去同學們的眼睛，到一個好地方去看好東西。這不是劉福高不願意大家跟着他去看，因爲這東西好看是好看的，說出來却不够嚮嘴，他自己是級長，級長就不能這樣馬馬虎虎的做錯事，汪元德是好朋友，自然是例外。</p>
<p>從學校前門再穿過兩條馬路，有一家小電影院。他們散學時，正是第二塲五時半將要開映。門口有一只方匣子嘩啦嘩啦放着好聽的歌曲；有些劉福高注元德也會唱，像大路，畢業歌，學校里都敎過的。但是那個匣子里放出來的聲音響亮，彷彿有許多人合唱似的。近門有一個玻璃櫃，就放着影片的呆照。如果就看看這個的話，他們還不致這樣秘密，因爲他們想着里面做的電影。他們想出一個方法來：偸偷地在門邊躱着，有三五個大人買票進去的時候，他們立卽挨着進去。這小電影院的定章，每一個大人可以帶一個孩子的。他們看過許多電影，都是用這方法，這方法是不能被同學們知道的。劉福高是級長啊！</p>
<p>昨天他又沒有和汪元德同路走，他覺得這書帶子害了他丟了一個好朋友，不知怎末想着又走到電影院門前來了。一看玻璃櫃里放着不少呆照，是獨各的，雙人的，外國女人跳舞照片。劉福高本來想用老方法進去看一下的，但是沒有汪元德在着他不很高興。他今天就沒有把書包帶帶來，拉汪元德來看跳舞。</p>
<p>但是當他們挨在三五個大人背後混進去的時候，被收票的擋住了，說是兒童恕不招待，一一鬧蹩扭，前面的人兒已不見了。他們不懂得兒童恕不招待的意思，倆個兒研究着被拒的理由是：這是外國女人跳舞，要一個人買一張票子，不准帶小孩。那末，他們要另想方法了，汪元德的意思，大家多積幾天的點心錢，級長却顯得更聰明，他說把包書帶賣了換錢來看電影，爲了要討好朋友的歡心，他願意拾棄那種搖呵搖的漂亮樣子的。注元德自然更歡喜，他們依依不捨的站在玻璃櫃邊，直等到方匣子里停了歌聲，才一路走一路想把包書帶換錢的方法。</p>
<h3>吧裏風光</h3>
<p>— 從龍</p>
<p>這素稱「熱帶的希臘」的吧裏，它確有許多値得給人們記憶，讚美，與留連的地方。</p>
<p>除了西部有了高山之外，其餘的盡是一片膏腴肥沃適合種植的平原。就是高山，那山洞的龐大，雄偉；火山噴口一帶的氣魄的莊嚴，嫻靜；晨昏的雲霧的繚繞，徐移，玉帶似的在尖削的山峯間浮蕩着。這些美景，在在都可以使人們感到快意，胸襟曠怡起來。</p>
<p>吧裏的土地的肥沃，和河流的四通八達地便於灌漑，稻田是絕沒有受到災害的降臨的。而且他們的種植，全不用受時節的限制，隨時都可以收穫，播種。每當天日晴明的時候，走到郊外去散步，你可以望見一片茫茫漠漠的水田裏，點綴着許多棕黑色的土人：有的正忙着揷秧，有的在趕有白色的水牛在犂鬆田土，有的却在收割着金黃的稻穗，怡怡樂樂地，在同一的時間內，各做着各種不同時期的工作。因爲氣候溫和，士地的肥沃與容易種植，故吧裏人的經濟情况大都是富裕的。</p>
<p>吧裏的女人，都完全的裸露着上身，讓兩隻新墳似的尖聳的乳峯，跟着她的步調一聳一聳地微顫着，不論在室內或街上都是終年如此。而男子則喜歡在頭髮上揷着紅白的花。據說這都是他們的習慣，從古先到現在還依然流行着。每當晨昏沐浴的時侯，他們不分男女都一絲不掛地同在河裏洗操，但很少聽見兩性間有不規矩或淫邪的羅曼斯的行爲。這碧水裏的一羣美麗的人體模型，在初到這裏來的會覺得有點兒羞澀和瞧不上眼的。</p>
<p>他們的居住的房屋，大都不甚注意，任憑它的破碎潰爛，汚齪窄狹，經不起暴風雨的吹打就有塌下來的危險，但他們却滿不在乎，並不想加以修葺，整理，好像這些都是小事情，不値得放在心頭上？他們寗願花着可驚的數目的金錢，在鬥鷄或祭神的廟會上。因此，在這兒要瞧見一座完整華麗的住宅，自然是指一般的平民層而說的）。簡直有如鳳毛麟角了。</p>
<p>吧里人全都信仰神敎，敬神可以說是他們每天重要工作之一。他們相信大地上的一切萬物都是屬於神和由神所統治的，神能給予人們的一切的快樂與幸運：所以，我吧里這個地方，不論是在高山上，海灘，堤岸，樹林，村落，以及每家人家的茅舍與皇宮的外面，都有大大小小的神廟的建造的：而他們的梭巴（村長）的唯一的任務却在於建造神的廟宇的事情。所以對於神廟的建築，都鈎心鬥角地精益求精，祇看那廟宇的外墻的拱門的彫刻，工程的偉大，藝術的高超，就叫人對於吧里人不會輕視的。</p>
<p>住居在吧里，每天都可以隱約地聽見一種低沉的銅鼓的聲音，在微風中蕩漾着，這就是他們在舉行廟會。當舉行廟會的時候，成羣的女人，穿着輕飄飄的綢質的外衣，佩着金銀的首飾，一排排蜿蜓地，有秩序地走向廟里去，頭頂上頂着各式各樣的祭品，遠望着彷彿千佛巖的一列華麗的彫刻的佛像。</p>
<p>吧里人又善於跳舞，她們的舞中却多寓演一些怪異的故事，舞者戴着金盔，佩着小刀，穿着燦爛的金葉子外衣，當舞得興高采烈的時候，這些跳舞的年輕的姑娘，時時抽出身旁的小刀割開自己的胸膛，讓股紅的血流淌出來而死，這正和逢着地方上發生瘟病的時候，小孩子在神廟之前，圍着猙獰的死神跳舞，而用手里的蛇形的短劍刺穿自己的胸膛一樣。她們相信一切的幸福都是神的賜予的，獻身於神才是一件純潔高超的事情的呵！</p>
<h3>舊書</h3>
<p>— 勞心</p>
<p>太無聊了的時候，我是今把自己安置在一些淸靜的角落裏的。因此這擺設在馬路的邊緣上的舊書攤，倒是我常立足的地方。這一天却發現了奇跡了，我在一堆舊書裏看見了兩本書，於是我盒起來親切地看，——沒有錯！這不是眼睛騙我的事，這是我一個遇着那不好的運氣的朋友的書，我還淸楚地記得在版權負上我瞎塗上的幾個開玩笑的字，和在第一，百二十三負上夾有一張剪報，一點還沒有錯，一點都依舊，雖然這書已經不知經過了幾許人的手上。從這本書我想起了四個月前的生活，我們還是在那裏談笑，還在那裏在鬧着靑年人的玩藝兒，在快樂地遇去那一連串的痛苦而困難的日子。在這時候，誰也不會想到現在是會變成這個樣子的，尤其是我，在這偌大的都市裏變得孤獨而且寂寞，沒有歡笑地去忍受那生活的給矛。想到了這，我變得更眷戀了這本舊書來了。</p>
<p>「老板，這本要多少錢？」</p>
<p>雖然，我明曉得袋子裏是一個銅板也沒有，但是只有一線的希望，我從來是不會放過的，因爲我知道這裏的老板他是認得我的，，也許叫他留起來讓我過幾天再來買是可能的，所以才冒昧地要向他打探一個價錢。</p>
<p>「老實說，我們從來不要說謊價，你要是買，八角大洋。」</p>
<p>他也帶着希望的音調來答覆我。因爲我知道有些時候他這個攤子是簡直沒有生意的，一會兒他又接上來說：</p>
<p>「還有咧，這裏還有幾本，都是一起兒收得來的。」</p>
<p>於是他接連地翻了五六本出來。這五六本舊書都是我認得的，而且其中有兩本，還是我自己的書而存在他的家裏的。我看到那這些書，象看到了熟朋友一樣，投着親切的眼光。雖然有點埋怨；那個朋友不應該地這些愛護了幾年的書都賈掉：但是回實想到他的環境，我明白的，在他離開這地方時是如何的窮，他如果不把這些書賣法，他是更不能過生活的。同時，我也願意原諒他，他不把這些書送給他的朋友，是因爲他沒有了這個的權利，同時他也不能在朋友中間借到什麽錢，或者獲到什麼帮助。比如我，便是最抱歉不過的，我答應了她的帮助，我變成了不兌現的支票，實在我也是給生活壓得透不過氣的一個，在失業半年的長時間中，我是嘗到了人生的一切享受的了。……</p>
<p>「要買嗎？」</p>
<p>老板看見我在那里另着，奇怪而不耐煩地望着我。</p>
<p>「啊，是的。我要買，不過今天實在買不起，你可以不可以替我留下來，最多過一兩天我找到了錢便要來買。」</p>
<p>我懇切地對他說，他也算作是答應了。</p>
<p>但是，我從那里找錢哩，在房錢還沒有着落的時候，可以再從那里找到一筆錢來買這書哩。於是，只好讓他一天一天地過去了，雖然心里是空着急，但也是沒有辦法的事。直到有一天借到了一隻洋，本來是爲了這幾天的吃飯的，可是我却忘記了一切地跑到了舊書攤去了。</p>
<p>「老板，書？」</p>
<p>他帶着微笑的抱歉：「你一個禮拜多沒有來了，我當作你忘記了，所以書都賣出去了。現在只剩了這一本。」</p>
<p>這一本是一婦人與社會。」在一個最低的價値中我買到了。當我拿那剩餘下來的最后財產去吃陽春大麵的時候，我翻着書，顯出了微笑。</p>

<p>玉蘭潑膽狠靑衣。不識奸謀大是非。旣乎嚇死王廷貴。逃出網羅揷翅飛。一葉扁舟藏避久。託名相請下鄕醫。誰知不見風聲響。已及南樓五七期。未曉如何瞞閉過。十分歡喜十分疑。歸家備禮登門吊。無病而亡絕不提。慚愧靈前並叩首。面容羞恥汗淋漓。孝幃主婢留心聽。言語聲言眞是伊。幾度園林尋不見。墻頭盼望影形稀。今宵親筆情書寫。藕斷絲連何作奇。面寄王文遺婢請。驚聞王祿扣園扉。蒼頭拾取眞憑據。一垜花墻兩步梯。誰曉東人謀害死。斷難隱忍斷難依。貞心侍妾忠心僕。恐被劉家父女欺。請官審斷始相宜。</p>

<p>開篇「長生殿」</p>
<p>開元御極慶承平。詔戒歡娛珠玉焚。挑宋張韓同爕理。贊襄黼座佐經綸。有一日。唐皇盰食宵衣倦。朝罷龍顏不樂聞。傳御侍臣高力士。問誰是。紅顏傾國又傾城。自從那。太眞寵幸宮中選。賜盒釵鈿作定情。身受君王新雨露。春寒浴日賜華淸。只見那。千嬌百媚矜裝束。偏是娥眉不讓人。姊妹承恩皆顯貴。平明騎馬人宮門。曲江遊禊爭相競。棄寫遺珠不足云。這時節。春睡海棠猶未足。芙蓉蓉帳裏擁香溫。六宮粉黛無顏色。遺棄佳人江采蘋。雖有那。十斛明珠親作賜。　門冷落夜黃昏。竟不料。太眞觸忤君王怒。獻髮猶沾　召恩，豈不聞。一騎紅塵鮮荔進。蒼生不及美人心。正逢那。牛郞織女雙星夕。世世生生作誓盟。那知道。歡樂未深愁已至。一剎間。漁陽鼙鼓動愁聲。都是那。祿山作亂兵謀叛。禍起蕭牆旦夕驚。因爲是。四海太平無事久。干戈弭患鮮公卿。怎奈何。君王西幸蒙　去。奔走長途車馬行。可憐他。一幅輕羅悲薄命。馬嵬坡下殞香魂。幸虧得。汾陽一起烽烟熄。御駕回　返帝京。只見那。白髮嬪娥人已老。梨園子弟半凋零。傷心往事空回首。死別悠悠莫再生。劍閣聞鈴魂欲斷。爭看羅襪酒家村。到後來。欲敎術士窮尋覓。宮關蓬萊豈是眞。獨奈何。底事君王迷入夢。情天恨海幻無因。倘然是。有人爭唱畏生殿。不作尋常歌曲聽。莫非是。治亂興衰感古今。</p>

<h3>我國古代建築略說（上）</h3>
<p>— 史東</p>
<p>我國建築術之發達，由來甚古。而在此長期的發達過程中，建築界所採用的建築材料，大都不出於磚（甎），木材，石料，泥十等物。其各尤以磚，早已遍用於我國各地，據諸文獻之所昭示，磚之披採爲建建築材料之用，遠在周代以前；而其使用之初期，則甚盛行於黃河流域各地。至於木材，在昔時則多使用於長江流域各地及南部等處。且當時黃河流域各地亦有滲用磚與木材的建築物。例如今之混用磚與木材的房屋之遍布我國各地一則，可爲此例證之一。又石料在當時，亦與磚及木材同樣，被採為建築材料之用。而泥土之被取爲建築材料，昔時尤以我國北部各地爲最。蓋北方各地旣缺乏木材，復又少雨量；是以住宅之建築，泥土正爲最適當的材料。至此，我國建築法雖由於使用建築材料而被决定；然嗣後又因採用石料及磚之發達的結果，拱的構造亦發達的很早，又穹的架構法亦相繼而產生。反之，在此長期間中，純木屋則不甚發達。蓋我國自古以來的建築法，背完全注重於細部的意匠及裝飾，卽專注重在外觀方面，是以木屋之建築，亦受其影響而不甚發達。</p>
<p>至於我國建築物之正面，普通大都採取前後左右均齊的構圖法。例如上自宮殿下至寺廟住宅以及墳墓，無不採用前後左右均齊的構圖法。這種構造法，可以說是我國人先天的性癖；並且這種思想，不但表現於建築物方面，卽如室內的凳子之排法，以及愛好文章之對句，都可以說是這種思想的表現。又我國古代建築物之外觀？其特質則在於使用華麗的色彩，與豐富的細部意匠，及特殊的屋頂。同時塗上顏色於建築物之外表，亦爲我國人之特性。例如木材之塗上顏色，或用玻璃瓦作壁之外表均是。由此一點可知，色彩之與我國建築物，誠有不可分離之關係。然而關於色彩之探用，自古以來亦有一種規定；卽依陰陽五行說而採用靑，紅，白，黃，黑之五色，因爲此五色均爲吉祥之象徵，並且嗣後又依此單純的五色爲基礎，而調製許多很强烈又富於刺戟性的色彩出來。又在我國建築物中的細部意匠之豐富，實用世界第一。再就窗形而言，不但有方形，圓形，橢圓形，多角形等；此外還有壺形，扁形，弧形，格狹間形等。而窗格之變化更爲複雜，有卐字系，多角系，冰字系，文字系，彫刻系等；在一城市中之建築之窗格形式達數百種百亦不算稀罕。至屋頂之形式，亦有懸魚形，柱礎形，樹拱形等，其細部工藝之精密，誠足以使人驚嘆不已。並且在屋頂的形式方面，我國建築法，對於外觀上的特徵，卽爲屋頂之構造，原則上必須呈凹曲形，這種屋形，在北方雖不多見，但南方的建築物大都屬於此形。其所以南北建法之互有差異，亦卽由於南北民族各有不同所致。並且由此亦足以窺知，講究外觀上的特殊美觀，亦是我國建築物之一要素。</p>
<h3>觀察本市體育塲的幾個新法則</h3>
<p>— 歐陽古</p>
<p>無論是公共集合的會塲，或運動體育塲，都同樣是訓練人民保守秩序，與鍛鍊體育的重要命脈，所以在歐美如美國的洛杉磯，與法國的凡爾賽等地，都在郊外有這種偉大運動體育塲的建設，但此類建築物的設計，俱以宏壯美觀而不失安全，又須經濟而切合實用爲原則，於是它的地位在無形中，也就成立了一種特殊的建築術，而與普通建築方法逈異的地方也很多，好在轟動全國的全運會業已閉幕，這個全市罕見的偉大建築—體育塲—正好給我們一個詳細的觀察，在這個不可磨滅的偉大建築間，很可以找出我們所需要的關於建築上的新法則，有許多確是普通所並不多覯的，下面的幾個片斷紀略，雖不逮什之一二，但是言小而見大，其餘的還待發見，因爲這種新法則的設計，都是國人經手監造，絕未假手外人，將來如果推廣應用，誰說不是中國建築界的好現象！</p>
<p>關於水泥壁柱的熱脹冷縮的防止，儘量應用科學物理的方法，每個看　的水泥節段處，與毘鄰的相互中間，空留出五分左右的伸縮縫，供給外界溫度如有升降的伸縮地位，此項水泥壁柱的水泥和三和士成分，因其爲構成看臺的基礎，不能稍為疏忽，所以它的配合成分，俱依：…二：四的體積爲比例，內部鋼筋亦規定每平方公分，須有一千二百五十公斤的拉力，更有一件足資爲一般參考者，據內部人言當建造時，監視者檢查鋼架結構的方法，殊爲新頴，卽無論各部鋼料規定制煉後，每平方公分的最大漲力。不得省於四千二百公斤，配合時先照屋頂樣圖，詳註尺寸大小，經該對無誤，方得截剪打眼，一切鉚釘亦經打合緊密，騐看方法祗須逐一用小錘擊之，其胃緊者發淸脆聲，其鬆動者則發破碎啞聲。</p>
<p>運動廳與健身房的光綫，純採高射式，穹屋頂的週圍裝置毛玻璃鐵絲天窗，可以滅除一切閃耀眩目的亮光，且健身房地板，均墊以油毛毡，下襯洋松企口板，上舖械木Marle毫無幅射光綫的可能性，並且與地下的潮氣，完全絕綠，可算是很完美的了。又全運會開始時，游泳次賽節目排在晚間，關於游泳內的燈光設備，更屬奇妙，蓋燈光裝置在池壁的水平面之下，比賽時燈光與水色非常調和，料想建造時一方令池壁玻罩的裝置，全不透水。另一方面又須防及水泥灣節及接筍處的滲漏，不料而今施用時，竟有如此成績，這也可以見得是國人技術發展的新途徑。</p>
<p>會塲大門廳所設司令臺及貴賓招待處，其上建有一種鋼架遮棚，凌空橫越伸展，設計的卓越奇異，卽整個上海全市，亦屬罕見，此項懸臂式的鋼架，長約十三尺餘，上覆玻棚，三面凌空，毫無撑條，確爲最近轉式的奇異設計。本屆運動會開幕共計十天，中外人士到達參觀者，至少有百萬人左右，於是對於體育塲的外表美觀問題，亦殊煞費苦心，我們首先觀察整個會塲的房屋建築，遍尋不見半個烟囱，因建造時，對於烟囱的設置，力求典雅，所以俱把它藏納於門樓巨鼎的屋頂上面，額依舊是矗立雲表，粗看上去，那裏想得到那便是設置爐灶的烟囪管呢！其餘四週的紅磚淸水牆，水泥柱子及大料，均擱入牆內隱而不見，殊爲整齊美觀，似乎是很合乎建築術上的整齊條件。</p>
<p>關於其餘各部的建築及施工情形與經過，本刊雙十節的建築特刊上已說得很詳細，這裏不想多贅，我們現在且看範圍如此廣褒的偉大建築，據該處工程管理處揭示之工欵及材料約計表報吿的數値，亦甚低廉，因所用材料，儘量採用國貨故也，且看了下表，便知它的確數：</p>
<p>房屋建築　九九五，三〇〇</p>
<p>衛生設備　六九，〇〇〇</p>
<p>電燈設備　一七，三〇〇</p>
<p>游泳池給水設備　三四，五〇〇</p>
<p>溝渠　七，八〇〇</p>
<p>跑道　六，七〇〇</p>
<p>球塲　一，四〇〇</p>
<p>鉛絲鋼　八，〇〇〇</p>
<p>水泥路　七，〇〇〇</p>
<p>填土工程　一五，〇〇〇</p>
<p>木看臺　六，〇〇〇</p>
<p>共計　一，一六八，一〇〇元</p>
<p>此外卽體育塲一切工程設計監造事項，俱由本市各機關主持規劃，通力合作，絕未假手外人，對於一應建築材料，亦莫不儘量採用國貨，足徵當局與努力建設之中，深寓提倡國貨之誠意，此堪爲建築界所當法式者也。</p>
<h3>瑞典的平民住宅建築</h3>
<p>— 不忍</p>
<p>瑞典的平民住宅建築運動，開始於一九一六年，主　事者爲斯篤科爾摩房屋合作社。此合作社係總工會所創辦；合作社的社員就是未來的住戶，火抵是低薪階級。他們對於作爲他們的住所的房屋的建造與管理，得到　預的機會。到了一九二二年，合作社的計劃，大體實現了，於是更進一步而從事普遍全國的運動。</p>
<p>在這運動之下，一個名叫「儲蓄建築社」（Hyresgasternas　SparkasseochByggnadsforening的社團——節稱H·B·S·——開始成立了。目前顯現於瑞典各城市的平民住宅建造的可驚的成績，不得不歸功於這H.B.S及其建築總工程師華蘭竇氏（Sven　Wallander）。</p>
<p>儲蓄建築社，總部設在斯篤科爾摩，是一個頗複雜的組織。牠購買基地，或長期租借基地。房屋建造後，由總部賣給各住宅區分社。總部記錄賬簿，管理財政，分賣住宅，並皆分社購辦燃斤及其他用品。整個社團由信託委員會管理，委員由分社代表公選，每年改選一次。</p>
<p>住戶，卽購買房屋者，都是儲蓄建築社的社員。社員入社時，應購股票一股，計洋十五元，週息六厘，並付屋價百分之十至百分之十五，其餘不足之數由總部墊付，此項經費大抵係從國立儲蓄銀行及保險公司借來。</p>
<p>房屋分甲乙丙一種，因此社員也分甲乙丙三種。甲種房屋屋價，自二千元起至一萬元以上，每年租金自一百五十元至八百元以上。乙種房屋屋價，自四百元至二千元，每年租金自一百二十元至五百元。丙種會員，入社時不付屋價，只須按年繳付租金。</p>
<p>茲以乙種社員每年繳付二百元爲例，指出每年租金之用途如下：</p>
<p>借欵利息……一二〇·〇〇元</p>
<p>借欵攤還……三五·〇〇元</p>
<p>供應……二一·〇〇元</p>
<p>熱與熱水……一六·〇〇元</p>
<p>修理……六·五〇元</p>
<p>準備金……一·五〇元</p>
<p>合計二〇〇·〇〇元</p>
<p>二十年期滿後，借欵全數付淸，房屋卽歸住戶所有，惟住戶每年仍須繳付相當租金，以充修理供應等費。已得房屋所有權之住戶，可將房屋出賣或出租，但須徵求H·S·B·之同意。</p>
<h3>建築行話（十九）</h3>
<p>— 梅震寰</p>
<p>—關於築塲裏用—</p>
<p>滿脚—假使並不依照築　裏另一種稱呼的話，那末，滿脚（Fill　Mud）的意思，就是塡平瀾泥，因爲築塲裏對於工作的進展，是取有一定的步驟，滿脚就在擺好大方脚（Footing）之後（按，擺好大方脚，亦爲行話之一，）進言之，滿脚也者，卽滿平大方脚的簡稱。</p>
<p>翻排—泥水匠砌墻，兩隻手對於墻身的高度等待够不到的時候，就得擱脚手（按擱脚手亦爲行話之一。）脚手有木與竹之分，木脚手祇少五六層房屋方纔可以用。普通如二三層房屋，差不爲用竹脚手比較多，因爲木脚手的用料複雜，如衝天，頂撑，泡脚，氣扛之類，而且人工也是浪費得多些，所以普通用竹脚手在經濟上合算些。如今講到翻排，究竟算是什麼意思，那就是先前說的泥水匠砌墻，兩隻手對於墻身的高度等待够不到的時候，從地面上說，祇有叫擱脚手，可是朝上就不能叫擱脚手，祇有叫翻排了，意思就是將脚手板翻上一排。</p>
<p>捉樣—不論大小工程的進行在人事的組織上除監工之外，就是翻樣。關切，等統治着下級的做手們，翻樣（詳前）的職司顧名思義，當然在圖樣上（築塲裏用的叫藍樣子）用心思。捉樣的意思，就是翻樣司務在藍樣上的尺寸放大，可是築塲裏不叫放樣而叫捉樣啊。</p>
<p>藍樣子—藍樣子的本身，並不是藍色的，是經過了科學作用之後，方纔變成藍色的，除了藍樣子在築塲裏有它的地位之外，還有一種照會樣子，那就是租界上的工部局或工務局應可的樣子。</p>

<h3>Peace Hopeful: Ceasefire Negotiations Confirmed; Immediate Submission to the League of Nations for Handling; Requires Agreement from the Emperor of Abyssinia; France, Italy, and England in Contact; Papal Representative Also Involved</h3>
<p>(London) London political circles acknowledge that the Italian and French governments have exchanged tentative suggestions to end the Italo-Abyssinian War. They also acknowledge that during a conversation between Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and British Ambassador to Rome, Sir Drummond, on October 18, the possibility of such a move was vaguely touched upon. It is said that the possibility of ending the Italo-Abyssinian War has so far only been explored informally. It is now believed that the exploration of ending the Italo-Abyssinian War was initiated by French Premier Laval during his meeting with the Vatican envoy, Luniavo, and the Italian Ambassador, Cerutti. Laval at that time proposed a plan advocating for the cession of a large portion of Abyssinian territory to Italy, with the port of Zeila in British Somaliland compensating Abyssinia. However, that port still requires passage through land ceded to England to reach it. Nevertheless, this solution is still far from Mussolini's desires, but France is now working hard to engage in peace exploration, and all actions are being made known to the British government. Therefore, the general public speculates that Mussolini's demand for a complete trusteeship over Abyssinia has now changed. (21st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) Since diplomatic negotiations were initiated from Paris, hoping to find a solution based on the suggestion made by British Minister Without Portfolio, Eden, at the Paris conference in August, and Italy's proposal to divide Abyssinia into mainland territory and border provinces, officials here believe that Italy will definitely support this negotiation. They also believe that if the Abyssinian issue does not involve European concepts, a solution should be easier to find. In addition, information about the recent diplomatic activities of England, France, and Italy has been transmitted to the Tigray Province in Abyssinia. It is heard that the Italian and Abyssinian authorities there have already begun negotiations. Italian authorities here believe that a solution seems to be achievable in a short period of time, and can be submitted to the League of Nations for consideration before the temporary truce on the northern front ends. As for the meeting between British Ambassador to Italy, Drummond, and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini on Friday, although a communiqué was issued afterward explaining the proceedings, according to what our reporter learned, several naval vessels have been withdrawn from the Mediterranean Sea. The Italian government has withdrawn a portion of the troops concentrated in Italian Libya. Although Italy has not yet made a final decision on this matter, the general public believes that it is very easy for Britain to recall warships, while it is more difficult for Italy to withdraw troops stationed in Libya. (21st Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is rumored that the League of Nations Administrative Council's five-nation committee for handling the Italo-Abyssinian dispute will soon resume resolving the Italo-Abyssinian issue, but responsible parties deny this. According to the Havas News Agency reporter's investigation, the delegations of various countries all believe that it is feasible for the five-nation committee to resume its work, but it must wait until the negotiations currently underway in London, Paris, and Rome have achieved satisfactory results before the five-nation committee can continue its meetings. Furthermore, any conditions for resolving the Italo-Abyssinian dispute must be agreed upon by the Abyssinian government before they can be proposed for discussion. (20th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Italy's Conquest of East Africa: Financial Resources Gradually Depleted; Losses Reach Over 134 Million Lire</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Federal Reserve Board reported today that as a result of the East African war, Italy's financial resources have gradually been depleted. (20th National Telegraph dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to the Ministry of Finance's announcement, as of the end of September, the treasury's income and expenditure accounts show that temporary expenditures in East Africa reached 63,300,000 lire for the month of September alone. The total for the three months of July, August, and September was 134,500,000 lire. In the month of September, total income was 161,600,000 lire, and total expenditure was 174,700,000 lire. The total financial deficit reached 13,100,000 lire. The amount of paper money in circulation reached 1,527,300,000 lire. (20th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Associated Press reporter today solicited opinions from delegates of various countries to the League of Nations on "whether sanctions can be effective." It is understood that the majority believe that after the member states implement economic and financial sanctions against Italy, it will not only have a significant impact on Italy, but also completely collapse the power of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. Some delegates predict that if Italy's expedition to Africa fails, the downfall of Mussolini's Fascist dictatorship will be inevitable, and the direct cause of its downfall will be Geneva's "war" on the economic and financial fronts. The sanctions plan completed by the League of Nations last Saturday will take quite some time to gradually implement, but it will eventually be able to economically and financially suffocate Italy. Economic experts believe that the impact of the League of Nations' sanctions will not be felt by Italy in the initial stage of implementation, because Italy is a highly industrialized country that can be self-sufficient in a short period of time, and Austria, Hungary, and Albania do not participate in the sanctions, and Switzerland is also slightly unwilling. Italy may be able to purchase raw materials such as steel, lead, oil, and copper from countries such as Germany, the United States, and Japan, all of which will make the effect of the sanctions occur more slowly. However, the general representatives all acknowledge that one of the most powerful moves of the League of Nations is the United Kingdom's control of the Suez Canal. Once it is blocked, the entrance to the Red Sea will be cut off, making it impossible for Italy's air force to reach it, so there is no need to fight on the Mediterranean side. (20th National Telegraph dispatch)</p>
<h3>British-French Cooperation Implemented: Naval Vessel Transfer in the Mediterranean</h3>
<p>(Geneva) It is learned today that, as a result of the British and French naval agreement for mutual assistance, the United Kingdom has ordered the warships Hood and Renown to withdraw from the Mediterranean. However, France has simultaneously increased its naval strength in the Mediterranean by 70,000 tons, so the two sides offset each other. (20th National Telegraph dispatch)</p>
<h3>Rumors of German Participation in Sanctions: Demanding Compensation from England</h3>
<p>(London) The diplomatic correspondent of the Morning Post recently declared, "Germany will demand considerable compensation from England as the price of participating in sanctions against Italy, to compensate for the losses suffered by participating in the sanctions. This should be the truth, but whether this price is financial assistance, as Germany desired the year before, wanting to issue German bonds on the London market, or diplomatic benefits, it is currently impossible to predict." (21st Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Algiers: It is widely rumored here today that the Algerian representative is conducting a credit loan of £2 million in England to purchase military weapons and ammunition. (21st National Telegraph dispatch)</p>
<h3>Swedish Prime Minister Expresses: Participating in the Collective System; Sanctions Not Hatred of a Country</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden: Prime Minister Hansson recently delivered a speech, stating the international situation, briefly saying, "The implementation of sanctions against Italy is neither hatred of a country nor opposition to a certain political system, but merely expressing an attitude against the aggressor. This is the same attitude that Sweden adopted when Belgium invaded South Africa in the past. The Swedish people unanimously agree that Sweden must participate in collective action in order to seek the restoration of peace. The representatives of the three bourgeois parties in Sweden are also consistent with the government and the Social Democratic Party on the policies in Geneva. If it is believed that the parliament should be convened to approve the policy of participating in sanctions against Italy, then the government does not object." (20th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>British East Africa: Implementing Neutrality Laws; Forcing Italian Ships to Sail Within 24 Hours</h3>
<p>Nairobi: The British East African colonial government has received instructions from London and today began implementing neutrality laws, forcing Italian ships to sail within 24 hours of arriving in port. The Italian ship Sesson Cotta was forced to leave Mombasa today, unable to complete loading gasoline and food destined for Italian Somaliland. However, it is understood that this neutrality law has nothing to do with the League of Nations' sanctions against Italy. (20th National Telegraph dispatch)</p>
<h3>British House of Commons to Meet Today: Discussing Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>(London) The House of Commons is scheduled to reconvene tomorrow to discuss foreign policy regarding the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. Prime Minister Baldwin has held separate meetings with various cabinet members before the House of Commons convenes, and this morning also met with the First Lord of the Admiralty, Sir Monsell. (21st Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Germany's Withdrawal from the League of Nations Takes Effect: Severing All Relations</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations takes effect at midnight today, and its relationship with the League of Nations is completely severed from now on. It is also different from Japan's withdrawal, because Germany has now severed relations with various League of Nations organizations, such as the League of Nations Labor Bureau, the World Court, and other non-political committees. When the League of Nations elects the members of the Administrative Council in the next term, Germany's vacancy will be filled by Canada. The most important issue caused by Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations is whether the Locarno Treaty, which is tied to Western European peace, is still in effect, because that treaty was conditional on Germany joining the League of Nations. Some legal experts believe that the treaty is still valid after Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations. (21st National Telegraph dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Starting from midnight on October 21st, Germany will formally withdraw from the League of Nations. According to the League of Nations' rules, a member state's declaration of withdrawal only becomes effective two years after the declaration. The German Deputy Chief Delegate to the Disarmament Conference, Rheinbaben, announced on October 14, 1933, that he had been ordered by the government to withdraw from both the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference at the same time. However, the formal notification of the German government's withdrawal from the League of Nations was sent out on October 21, 1933. Therefore, counting the date, Germany will only implement its withdrawal from the League tomorrow at midnight. As a result, the seat on the League of Nations Administrative Council established for the German representative will be removed the day after tomorrow. As for Japan's seat, it was removed in February of this year. Germany requested to join the League of Nations on February 10, 1926. A League of Nations Extraordinary General Assembly was convened in February of that year, but it was not approved. It was only announced on October 10, 1926, that it would join the League of Nations. In total, Germany joined the League of Nations for a total of nine years. After Germany withdraws from the League of Nations, it will also withdraw from the League of Nations Labor Bureau. The Board of Directors of the Bureau will meet this week to select a successor to the German seat on the International Labor Bureau. Canada, the original director of the International Labor Bureau, recently gave up one of its seats as a director to the United States because the United States joined the Labor Bureau. This time, after Germany withdraws, Canada will probably succeed as a director. (20th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Inspecting the Near East: Matsushima Returns Home to Report; Offers Advice to Hirota</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Foreign Ministry Inspector, Ambassador Matsushima, returned to Japan on the 19th after completing his official duties. At 11:00 a.m. today, he visited Foreign Minister Hirota to report on the inspection situation. He offered some suggestions to Foreign Minister Hirota on the results obtained. Ambassador Matsushima's opinions include: (1) The new national movements in India and the Near East should be given special attention by the Japanese side, and permanent countermeasures should be determined. (2) New overseas consulates should be established in Paris and other places to expand commerce and trade. (3) A general organization for export control should be established as soon as possible. (21st China United Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>Italian Silk Dumping: Japanese Merchants Panic</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to news from Japanese industrial circles, Italy has decided to adopt a silk dumping policy in order to prepare for military affairs. The market price of Italian silk exported abroad will be reduced by 10% compared to Japanese silk, in order to compete with Japanese silk for the market and use this price to buy military supplies. As a result, the Japanese silk industry has been greatly panicked, and the losses suffered by the Japanese silk industry will be very large. (21st China United Press dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Issue of British-French Cooperation Amidst Calls for a Ceasefire</h3>
<p>— Ang</p>
<p>There have been quite a few diplomatic contacts between England, France, and Italy recently. The most noteworthy is Mussolini's meeting with the British ambassador and British Foreign Secretary Hoare's meeting with the Italian ambassador, separately, to discuss easing the situation in the Mediterranean. London and Rome also simultaneously issued statements on Sunday, reiterating that they have no hostility toward each other. This action, as Italian Foreign Ministry personnel said, only indicates that the door to reconciliation has not been closed. In terms of the actual overall situation, it can be said that it has little relationship. England has no intention of acting alone, which was the main point of Foreign Secretary Hoare's declaration to the League of Nations General Assembly on September 11. And Italy has no intention of infringing on British rights, which is also consistent with what was stated in the Italian cabinet communiqué on September 28.</p>
<p>However, Italy is a newly emerging industrial country, and its motive for military adventures in East Africa is the domestic economic panic. Therefore, the blow from the League of Nations' economic sanctions is currently causing the Italian army to suffer from the pain of wanting to fight but being unable to. Mussolini's recent silence can roughly be seen as his hesitant mood. According to recent news, England, France, and Italy are already discussing the terms of a ceasefire in East Africa. It can be seen that Italy is finding it difficult to continue with the military effort.</p>
<p>The recent slight rapprochement between England and Italy was promoted by the French navy's willingness to assist England in the Mediterranean. The inevitability of British-French cooperation has been discussed before. England and France in Europe are like England and the United States in the Far East. If they unite, they will succeed; if they do not unite, they will fail. The matter is very obvious. Moreover, British and French policies are both based on the League of Nations. However, their targets are the Mediterranean for England and the Rhine for France. The crux of the negotiation lies in how to integrate these two issues under the same collective system. France is reluctant to sacrifice the French-Italian friendly relations established by the Rome Agreement in January of this year. England is also unwilling to damage the British-German understanding promoted by the London Naval Agreement in June. England and France are hesitant to act, and the discussion of cooperation has presented a circuitous and tortuous appearance. However, within the scope of the League of Nations, the actions of the two countries are step-by-step and have never deviated slightly.</p>
<p>Now, from a historical perspective, a further examination shows that the current British-French cooperation negotiations can be seen as a continuation of the collective peace system negotiations after the European War, and also an advancement in enriching the League of Nations movement. The collective security system was originally what France longed for but could not obtain. After the Anglo-American-French alliance proposal in 1920 suddenly vanished, collective movements, such as the Mutual Assistance Treaty in 1922 and the Geneva Protocol in 1924, all failed due to England's unwillingness to participate. The Locarno Treaty, which England participated in in 1926, was only a partial version of the collective system. Although England repeatedly issued joint declarations with France and Italy on the issue of maintaining Austrian independence, it was still unwilling to immediately agree to use military force as its backing. France took advantage of the good opportunity presented by British Foreign Secretary Hoare's declaration to the League of Nations General Assembly last month to bring up the old matter again in order to "fill the gap between England and France in the collective security system." England then consulted France on the issue of naval cooperation in the Mediterranean. As a result, after more than a month of exchanging documents, the negotiations finally came to an end last Saturday. In summary, England only gave a general reply, that is, to abide by the obligations of the entire League of Nations Covenant. In addition, it is unwilling to specify any reservations on special issues. France also only agreed to fulfill the negative mutual assistance obligations under Article 16, Paragraph 3 of the Covenant. Looking at this from the past, it is already a considerable progress. However, the true strength of the Covenant lies in Article 16, Paragraph 2, concerning military sanctions. This still awaits an opportunity for testing.</p>
<h3>Mongolian Political Council Officially Convenes Yesterday</h3>
<p>Discussing bandit suppression and the implementation of Upper Street proposals</p>
<p>Bailingmiao: The current session of the Mongolian Political Council convened its opening ceremony on the 9th. Because several members were still absent, a series of informal meetings were held first to engage in research on various topics.

<h3>Travelers Leaving the Customs at Shanhaiguan: Suddenly Blocked Again Recently</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to transportation sources, the Japanese Daito Company in Shanhaiguan previously suspended the sale of certificates and prohibited farmers and workers inside the customs from leaving the customs. The Beining Railway Bureau announced to the local authorities a method to prohibit Chinese workers from entering the country. After that, those who left the customs followed the procedures, so the number of those who were blocked gradually decreased. Unexpectedly, starting on the 19th of this month, the Japanese side in Shanhaiguan suddenly prohibited passage again. More than 400 people were blocked that day. Travelers leaving the customs on the 20th and 21st were also blocked. The travelers were divided and housed in the camps, Luanxian, and Tangshan areas. The hotels were all overcrowded. (21st special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The reason why the puppet border police in Shanhaiguan prohibited travelers from leaving the customs on the 19th is rumored to be that rumors are rife outside the customs. Russo-Japanese relations are tense, and Harbin and Changchun have been placed under undeclared martial law. Therefore, Chinese people are prohibited from entering the country.

<h3>Scattered Battles on the East African Front, Italian and Abyssinian Armies Consolidate Positions, Italian Army on the Northern Route Attacks Magal Without Success, Rome Official Report Southern Army Occupies Two Important Passes</h3>
<p>(Rome) Today's official report stated that fighting broke out in the Danaleh defense zone on the southern front in Abyssinia. The Italian side suffered 14 Italian soldiers and 10 native soldiers killed and the opposing side suffered 50 killed and many wounded. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Asmara According to detailed reports received here today on the fighting on the southern front, the Italian army has seized the strategically important locations of Solaf and Gajiuli. The Abyssinian army there suffered heavy losses due to bombing by Italian aircraft. Five Italian aircraft were hit by gunfire but all returned safely to base. It is heard that this victory will demoralize the Abyssinian army. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian army on the southern route, attacking Abyssinia, has already occupied the area of Hilaf north of the city of Gelokubi. Military figures here believe that this move will make it easier for General Graziani, commander-in-chief of the southern route, to advance on the town of Gorahei (an important town in the Ogaden region), which is extremely important strategically. The Abyssinian forces are currently concentrating at Gorahei Town, with two routes: one led by General Nazibi, heading from Harar City along the Fafan River to Gorahei Town; the other led by General Destu, the Abyssinian son-in-law, heading from the southwest along the Wabi Shebelle River to the town. The Italian military strategy is to surround the Abyssinian forces in Gorahei Town, forcing them to retreat north to Harar City. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa Fighting on the southern front is still quiet. Abyssinian forces are currently constructing solid defensive works in Dagapo to prevent Italian forces from invading Harar. Dagapo is 120 miles southeast of Harar. It is heard that the Abyssinian forces in Harar and Jijiga are currently suffering from spotted fever, and the British Somaliland of Lumberbera is rushing medicine to help them. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Axum The Italian army's northern front, in the 40 miles between Axum and Adigrat, has gradually become consolidated, preparing for the first major offensive. Military authorities at the Italian headquarters today estimated that there are approximately 100,000 Abyssinian troops distributed in various locations within 100 miles in front of the Italian front. However, there is currently no fighting on the entire northern front. According to news here, the number of Italian casualties to date is one officer, five soldiers, and 23 Ascari soldiers. In addition, 70 soldiers were injured. At the same time, Italian aircraft are still bombing Abyssinian troop concentration points in various nearby locations. (National Electric, 20th)</p>
<p>Asmara From the look of things, the second major objective of the Italian army's northern advance, the city of Magal, 65 miles southeast of Aduwa, cannot be obtained without a major battle. Reconnaissance aircraft returning from the front claim that Abyssinian General Gaza is currently leading a large force from the southwest towards Magal, and another large force is guarding the previously occupied positions. At the same time, the Italian army is preparing to attack and is gradually occupying the mountains around Adigrat. The arrival of Italian Chief of Staff General Badoglio at the front has aroused various speculations. According to interviews with General and Reuters reporters, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini may visit the battlefield one day, which is also expected. Mussolini's large portraits are prominently displayed in the areas occupied by the Italian army, which is clear evidence that he can win the hearts of the people. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Italian Aircraft Carry Out Extensive Bombing, Progress on the Southern Front</h3>
<p>(London) According to a telegram received here, the Italian army on the southern front killed many Abyssinian soldiers today. It is claimed that Italian aircraft bombed Abyssinian trenches in Dahelai and Hilaf, and used machine guns to strafe. Afterwards, Italian and Ascari soldiers charged forward. The Abyssinian army resisted strongly. After several hand-to-hand combats, the Italian army was able to occupy the position, but the first charge was repelled. (National Electric, 21st)</p>
<p>Tigray Front According to our correspondent Bal, the Italian army on the Somaliland front has made important progress and has occupied the Hilaf area north of the city of Gelokubi, capturing two cannons, multiple trucks, and countless prisoners. Hilaf is located midway between Gorahei Town (in the Ogaden region) and Italian Somaliland. Recently, the Abyssinian army was preparing to resist the Italian army's in-depth advance there, but it has now been occupied by the Italian army. Also, ten Italian aircraft flew to the town of Dahelai to carry out bombing and dropped incendiary bombs, causing fires. The Abyssinian army has recently deployed heavy troops along the Wabi Shebelle River in the Garafu area for defense. The aforementioned town of Dahelai, which was bombed, is not far from that position. In addition, Italian aircraft continue to bomb the Purtoni area along the Wabi Shebelle River. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Two Columns Lose Contact in the Desert</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa Our special correspondent Auchina reports the following military news from the front:</p>
<p>(1) "Eastern Front": Recently, two Italian columns have advanced from Mount Musayari. The first column advanced too quickly, resulting in getting lost in the hot desert area and losing contact with the second column carrying supplies. It had to be temporarily supplied with food and water by aircraft. In addition, road-building troops near Mount Musayari have contracted eye diseases due to the infection of germs from rotten wood used for road building. (2) "Northern Front" is currently in a state of stagnation. (3) "Southern Front": Rumors that the Italian army in the Ogaden area has occupied the Gelokubi water source, but the radio station there is still working as usual.</p>
<p>In short, the real fighting has not yet begun on all sides. The majority of the Abyssinian forces are concentrated in Tigray Province, because the climate, geographical conditions, and strong folk customs of that province are sufficient to temporarily hinder the Italian army's progress. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Italian Army Wins Hearts and Minds, Local Chiefs Surrender</h3>
<p>Aduwa Since Italian General Tai Bono, commander of the Italian army's northern route, ordered all Abyssinian clergy and soldiers who do not surrender to the Italian authorities within ten days to be regarded as enemies, 200 Cop脫派 monks and several lower-level chiefs have surrendered to the Italian army today. (National Electric, 21st)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to news from the city of Aksum in Abyssinia, more than 200 Cop脱派 churches in the area have jointly surrendered to the Italian army, including Maria, the son of the chief of the Echaha area. The majority of villagers in the Italian-occupied areas have turned in their privately owned rifles manufactured by European factories to the Italian army. The abolition of slavery by General Tai Bono, High Commissioner for East Africa, has not caused unrest among the slave owners, because the existing slaves, although restored to freedom, can still serve as servants or soldiers in their masters' homes. In order to win the hearts and minds of the people, the Italian army is implementing various benevolent acts to avoid causing ill will among the Abyssinian people. For example, after the Italian army occupied the city of Aksum, it distributed the wheat stored by the Abyssinian authorities in the city to nearby residents. At the same time, it is expanding sanitation facilities in the occupied areas and establishing many temporary aid stations. In addition, it plans to establish several hospitals and hire doctors with colonial medical experience to serve the natives. The first hospital will be established in the city of Aduwa and is currently being set up and should be completed soon. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>阿國各地戰士　開赴前綫作戰</h3>
<p>From Aking: Warriors from all parts of Abyssinia continue to arrive in the capital. After being equipped with weapons and ammunition by the authorities, they are being dispatched to the front lines for combat. As for the destinations and operational plans, due to military secrets, nothing has been disclosed. General Yabaaba's warriors from the Gofa region also arrived here this morning and are stationed 20 kilometers outside the capital. All the bullets they carried were carefully inspected by the Abyssinian Imperial Guard because, a few days ago, many troops coming from the interior were found to be carrying dumdum bullets. Since the International Red Cross Convention prohibits the use of dumdum bullets, the Abyssinian Emperor has specifically prohibited his subordinates from carrying this type of bullet. However, it is rumored that Italian troops are still using dumdum bullets in combat, but this has not been confirmed. It is still unknown whether the Abyssinian Emperor is preparing to lodge a formal protest with the Geneva authorities regarding this matter. Furthermore, the Abyssinian Emperor's front lines recently captured a large number of Italian spies, who will soon be brought to the capital for separate interrogation. (20th Muharram dispatch)</p>
<h3>意軍衛生狀況　據稱甚形良好</h3>

The Italian army has built 183 miles of new roads and dug 121 wells in the occupied territories of Abyssinia. Merchants are now following the army closely. Italians and Eritreans have already opened many shops in Adigrat and Hintalo. Sir Gastellani, a famous doctor in charge of sanitation in the occupied territories of Abyssinia, is very satisfied with the health of the Italian troops, saying that the sanitation of the Italian troops on the northern front is very good. Only one hospital ship carried sick soldiers back to Italy last month, totaling 202 officers and soldiers, with no wounded. There are now five ships converted into hospital ships, one of which is permanently stationed in Massawa. (October 20th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>法參院改選結果　左派勢力加增　賴伐爾獲選政府地位益固　共黨佔有席位此爲第一次</h3>
<p>(Paris) Premier Laval's mediation for peace is now deeply popular, allowing him to win today's Senate election. Laval has now been re-elected. However, the Zena district is extremely left-leaning, and the other nine candidates who received the same number of votes as Laval have all lost. It was learned today that Laval believes this election result is due to the support he has gained for his policies on the Italo-Abyssinian conflict and European issues. (October 20th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) One-third of the French Senate has been re-elected. The highlight is the election of the current Premier and Foreign Minister Laval, which has further consolidated the position of the French government. Although there was active and significant opposition from the left wing, Laval ultimately won. His domestic and foreign policies have gained the trust of the people. Efforts by left-wing parties in the parliament to overthrow the government in the future may not succeed. Mr. Basile has been elected in the Seine Province, making him the first Communist Party member to join the French Senate. The final result of the election is that the current situation can be maintained, and the Radical Party remains one of the most influential parties. (October 30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today's senatorial election involved re-electing one-third of the senators, with two rounds of voting. A total of 107 senators were elected. The number of seats obtained by each party is shown in the following table:</p>
<p>Non-affiliated 2 seats, Conservative Party 1 seat, Republican Party 26 seats, Left Republican Party 17 seats, Non-affiliated Radical Party 5 seats, Radical Socialist Party 38 seats, Non-affiliated Socialist Party 2 seats, New Socialist Party 4 seats, Socialist Party (i.e., the French branch of the Second International) 10 seats, Communist Party 2 seats, totaling 107 seats.</p>
<p>Although the results of this re-election do not significantly change the distribution of power among the parties in the Senate, the strength of the left wing has increased. In total, among the 107 seats elected, the right-wing and central parties account for 51 seats, while the left-wing and extreme left-wing parties account for 56 seats. This is the first time that the Communist Party has been elected to the Senate. The party leader, Xiang, is also among those elected. It is noted that the Senate election adopts a restricted election system. A portion of the electors are representatives of municipal councils. Since the recent municipal council elections, the left-wing parties have won victories. Generally, it was expected that the United Front of the left wing would win in the Senate re-election, and this has now happened, especially in the Seine Province, which includes the districts of Paris. After the first round of voting, the United Front of the left wing immediately elected seven people. (October 21st Havas dispatch)</p>

Five people died and many were injured throughout England. The Glasgow steamship "Fotoria" sank 700 miles off the coast of Ireland, and the lives of those on board are feared to be in danger. Thirty-seven sailors escaped in several small boats, but despite being searched for by several ships for 24 hours, they have not been found. A Newcastle coal ship also capsized in the storm. Fortunately, all 22 crew members were rescued by a Norwegian ship. The German ship "Olfort" was initially reported to have lost its thruster, and there has been no news since. There were a total of 25 people on board. The French ship "Agral" ran aground on a beach near Westdie. The sailors are still staying on board. (October 21st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Amsterdam: A hurricane occurred in the North Sea today. The British freighter "Ben Dennis" has capsized, but all 23 sailors on board were rescued by the Norwegian ship "Alyeska".

<h3>希臘復辟運動　現總理力主恢復王泉</h3>
<p>Athens: Prime Minister Gondyles recently gave an interview to a reporter from the "Kadirini News," stating, "The nation's politics should now be thoroughly reformed. The basic points of reform are threefold: (1) Restore the monarchy and consolidate royal power, so that the King becomes the supreme arbiter of all parties; (2) Reform the administrative organs; (3) Increase administrative power. However, in order to implement this platform, it must be approved by the King. Therefore, after the King returns to the country and is restored to his position, the cabinet should submit its resignation." (October 20th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Athens: A military-civilian carnival was held at the Athens stadium today. Government officials attended, and the crowd shouted "Long live King George II of Greece!"

During the rally in Thessaloniki, former Prime Minister Tsaldaris gave a speech to the crowd, also advocating for inviting George II to return to the country and be restored to his position. (October 20th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Athens: The royalists recently held a large rally at the stadium, with approximately 60,000 participants. Regent Gondyles attended the rally and gave a speech, stating, "Although the new government includes several important leaders of the People's Party, the government has no intention of adopting new party politics. On the contrary, we should eliminate party strife and enable the national government to achieve its purely patriotic goals. Furthermore, the National Assembly will vote to abolish the republican system, while ensuring that all voters participating in the plebiscite are in an equal position. The National Assembly fully respects the sovereignty of the people, allowing the people to make the final decision on the issue of the form of government. At present, the vast majority of the people hope to achieve restoration, and since the abolition of the republican system, the general calls for a republic have ceased, and the country has returned to peace."

<h3>漢德森逝世</h3>
<p>(London) Henderson, Chairman of the League of Nations Disarmament Conference, passed away today. It is unknown how strongly Italy's attack on Abyssinia has affected Britain. Henderson's attending physician was well aware of his deep concern for the European situation, so since the start of the war, he has prohibited him from reading newspapers and told visitors not to mention the Italo-Abyssinian war to him. Henderson's death is a great loss to the millions of British workers whom he has led for many years. Even leading figures in politics have praised his achievements. Sir Chamberlain, who served in the wartime cabinet with Henderson, stated that everyone admired Henderson's dedication to peace. Viscount Cecil, a champion of peace, stated that Henderson's death is a cause for mourning for the future of peace. Atlee, the recently elected leader of the Labour Party, stated that no one could match Henderson's dedication to public service and commitment to peace. (October 20th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Henderson, Chairman of the Disarmament Conference and former British Foreign Secretary, one of the most prominent figures in the British Labour movement, passed away today at the age of 72. He was born on September 13, 1863. He learned the casting trade as a child. He was a trade union official and was elected as a Member of Parliament in 1903, serving for more than 30 years. In 1917, he joined the wartime cabinet as a minister without portfolio. In 1924, he served as the Home Secretary in the Labour government. From 1929 to 1931, he served as Foreign Secretary, deeply trusted by the then Prime Minister MacDonald. When MacDonald reorganized the national unity government, Henderson and other Labour leaders were dissatisfied with MacDonald's actions and resigned in anger. When he was in charge of foreign affairs, the Disarmament Conference elected him as its chairman. Although he later left the British government, he was unwilling to give up his position as chairman of the Disarmament Conference. It is almost unprecedented for a politician in opposition to chair such an important international conference. (October 20th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>美著名探險家　葛雷萊將軍逝世　曾著有北極探隊記一書</h3>
<p>(Washington) General A.W. Greely, a famous American military figure, explorer, and author, has passed away at the age of 91. He served in the military since the outbreak of the Civil War, serving the country for 50 years. In 1881, he led an expedition into the Arctic region with 25 people. Only seven survived, including Greely. Although the sacrifice was great, the world learned that there were thousands of miles of land in the Arctic region. The American Geographical Society awarded him a medal, and the American government promoted him in the military, commending his achievements. Greely wrote many books on the climate conditions in various parts of the world, and his Arctic Exploration Account was particularly popular. At the age of eighty, he wrote another book entitled "The Arctic Region in the Twentieth Century," published in 1928. Greely paid close attention to science and made many contributions to American radio and aviation. (October 20th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>Former Japanese Ambassador to China, Shigemitsu, Hosts Economic Survey Mission</h3>
<p>Deep rapport between financial circles of both countries; plan to establish an organization to promote bilateral trade</p>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch: The economic survey mission, since arriving in Tokyo a week ago, has been extremely busy with daily receptions, banquets, tours, and symposiums. By the 14th, discussions on trade between the two countries had generally come to a conclusion. The key to improving relations between the two countries lies in mutual economic benefit and assistance. The Japanese side also holds the same view. This time, financial leaders from both countries gathered to hold frank discussions, resulting in a very harmonious rapport. A unanimous agreement was reached to jointly initiate an organization to promote trade between the two countries by figures from the financial sectors of both sides. After the completion of the economic discussions, on the 14th, Foreign Vice-Minister Shigemitsu hosted a luncheon at his residence, attended by various bureau chiefs. Shigemitsu delivered a speech, stating, "In recent years, Japan's industry has developed rapidly. We welcome the visit of leaders from the Chinese economic community and believe that it will be greatly beneficial to the future of both countries. Many of you are old friends of mine, and this is a rare opportunity. I am very honored by your presence today and hope to have a pleasant conversation." Wu Dingchang then gave a speech, stating in essence, "When Mr. Shigemitsu served as Ambassador to China, it was a time of diplomatic difficulty between China and Japan. We have long been aware of Mr. Shigemitsu's efforts for the happiness of relations between the two countries. The current difficulties in the Sino-Japanese situation have not only not diminished, but may have even intensified. Therefore, we cannot help but hope that Mr. Shigemitsu will exert even greater effort. At the tea party the other day, I heard Foreign Minister Hirota cite the saying from the Analects, 'If you don't receive commands, you will make wealth.’ I hope that both countries will pursue economic exchanges with benevolence and righteousness. Today, I will quote Mencius's reply to King Xuan of Qi's question, 'Is there a way to befriend neighboring countries?' Mencius replied, 'Yes. Only the benevolent can serve the small with the great, and only the wise can serve the great with the small.' I feel that Japan, since the Meiji Restoration, has been quite capable of utilizing this diplomatic principle. In the past, it can be said that it has exhausted the abilities of the wise. The most prominent example is the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, which achieved the greatest diplomatic success. Now that Japan's national strength is increasing day by day, it has reached the point where it should study how to serve the small with the great. However, serving the small with the great is more difficult than serving the great with the small, because it is often easy to interpret serving the small as subjugating the small, which violates the clear instruction in the Four Books that 'those who subdue people with force do not win their hearts.' Therefore, I hope that Japan can understand the principle of serving the small with the great. In the future of Sino-Japanese diplomacy, it will surely achieve the greatest success." Afterwards, they engaged in casual conversation, and the gathering ended happily around 2 PM. At 3 PM, they went to the private residence of Fujiyama, president of Dai-Nippon Sugar Manufacturing Co., Ltd., to attend a tea party. At 9 PM, they took the night train from Tokyo to Osaka for a tour. They are scheduled to return to Tokyo in a week and then disband and return to their respective countries.</p>
<h3>The Sugar Cane Industry in Chaozhou and Shantou</h3>
<p>The Monopoly Bureau cracks down on private sales</p>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: The Chaozhou-Shantou First Sugar Factory, this spring, selected a factory site in Quxi, Jieyang, and purchased more than 50 mu of private land, of which seventy to eighty percent has been completed. Most of the main machinery has been installed. The Quxi location has very convenient water and land transportation. Sugar production can begin next month. According to Zheng Zonghan, a member of the factory's preparatory committee, the purchase of sugarcane from the people has been entrusted to the Huasheng Company. The price is set at 7 hao per dan (100 jin). The Huasheng Company has ordered 9.8 million dan from Jieyang, Puning, and Chaoan counties, which can be continuously supplied to the factory for manufacturing. Currently, sugarcane farmers in the Chaozhou and Jieyang rural areas are very worried about the sugar factory purchasing sugarcane from the people because: (1) The government stipulates 7 hao per dan of sugarcane, and the handling Huasheng Company also wants to earn a commission of 1 hao and several fen; (2) For sugarcane fields far from Quxi, manual carrying and transportation by boats will add another 1 hao and several fen of costs per dan; (3) If the sugarcane tails are also transported, there will be a lack of sugarcane seeds for next year. If the sugarcane tails are cut off, the farmers will suffer too much loss; (4) Once the sugarcane is sold, the farmers' homes will lack fuel for cooking throughout the year; (5) If the sugarcane is cut and handed over too late, the sugar juice will be less, and the weight will also be lighter, resulting in too much loss; (6) The sugarcane in the field must wait for the factory's orders, and if it is left in the field for too long, it will delay spring plowing. Furthermore, the fertilizer and bean cakes used for planting sugarcane this year have already increased in price, and the land rent has also been changed to land tax. The sugarcane sold, after deducting the handling fees and transportation fees by the handlers, will only yield 4 or 5 hao, which is not even enough to offset the fertilizer and land rent. Therefore, the farmers are all very disappointed.</p>
<p>The Chaozhou-Shantou Provincial Sugar Monopoly Bureau has a public warehouse in Shantou. White sugar is transported from Guangzhou, and 6,000 to 7,000 dan can be sold in Chaozhou and Meizhou counties each month. The price is 17.5 yuan per dan. Each county has distribution points, and inspection teams and sugar inspectors are stationed at key transportation points. Boats, vehicles, households, and shops can be searched everywhere. Shops without permits cannot sell white sugar. Sugar sales permits must be renewed once a year. At the end of September, all permits will expire and new permits will be issued. In more than ten counties in Chaozhou and Meizhou, only 100 wholesale and retail business permits are issued for each market town and village. Those without this permit cannot engage in the sale and transportation of white sugar. In addition, 500 small retail business permits are issued. Shops that do not display this permit at the entrance cannot sell or store sugar in the store. These measures can be said to be extremely thorough.</p>
<p>The Chaozhou area was originally a region that produced native sugar. The annual export of native sugar is no less than 2 to 3 million dan. Native sugar merchants occupy an important position in the economic and commercial sectors. Since the provincial government implemented a white sugar monopoly, restrictions and management have been added to native sugar. The previously promulgated measures for registering native sugar were not understood and sympathized by the masses in Chaozhou and Shantou, so they were improved. After native sugar is registered, those who transport it out of the province must obtain a transportation and sales permit from the provincial sugarcane transportation and sales branch office at the place of origin or transit, in order to transfer it. If it arrives in Shantou, the permit must be taken to the Shantou branch office to cancel the number before it can be exported. If it is transported and sold within the province, and the place of arrival does not have a transportation and sales branch office, the transportation and sales permit will be mailed back to the place where the transportation and sales permit was originally issued to cancel the number. The government's reason for taking these procedures of checking, registering, obtaining transportation permits, release forms, and canceling numbers everywhere is said to be to prevent the mixing of foreign sugar, to prevent the development of native sugar, and to avoid affecting the progress of sugar production and sugarcane purchases.</p>
<h3>Anhui Province: Conscripting Labor for Water Conservancy Projects; Regulations for Conscripting Labor in Various Counties Have Been Drafted</h3>
<p>Anqing Dispatch: The Anhui Construction Department believes that this year's water conservancy construction is about to enter the implementation and construction period. Regarding the organization and conscription of labor, a plan must be drafted. Therefore, the revised regulations for the Engineering Committee of each county and the newly drafted regulations for the conscription of labor for water conservancy in each county were submitted to the provincial government's regular meeting on the 18th and passed. The following is a transcript:</p>
<p>Regulations for Conscripting Labor for Water Conservancy in Various Counties</p>
<p>Article 1: In order to carry out water conservancy projects and conscript labor in various counties of this province, unless otherwise stipulated by laws and regulations, these regulations shall be followed. Article 2: Conscripted labor is divided into two types: obligatory labor and beneficiary labor.

<h3>Songjiang: Construction Department Technician Inspects Branch Line</h3>
<p>After the county government completed the construction of the Songsi Road, it continued in late September to start work on a branch line from the North Gate to the New East Gate to connect to Songwei Road. It passes through the prosperous streets of the East Gate and requires the demolition of more than 40 private houses, which does not match the three and a half rooms of the former Times Hall owned by Mr. Jin. This has led to merchants and local people in the East Gate requesting assistance and almost causing disputes. The county government temporarily ordered the suspension of work and telegraphed the Construction Department to send personnel to inspect. The Construction Department specially appointed Mr. Yang Tingzuo, a technician, who arrived in Songjiang on the 21st. After visiting County Magistrate Li, he went with him to the branch line for a field inspection and invited local people Qian Xuanqing, Zhu Jwang, Yao Lianbo, etc., as well as the County Party Department of the Koumintang, the County Chamber of Commerce, and Shen Fuyun, the head of the First District, to talk at the county government. Technician Wu was very dissatisfied with the discrepancy in the piers of the demolished houses reported by the competent department. However, regarding the change of line, because the base along the city is within six meters, the regulations do not allow any buildings, so there is no way to change the original line. Regarding the compensation for the demolition of houses for the victims, it was agreed to increase the compensation and revise the original budget. He asked those present to go out and explain tactfully, etc. Mr. Qian and others stated that the losses of the people were too heavy and asked for the prompt arrangement of cash payments to take care of the people's difficulties, etc. It was not until 6 PM that the meeting ended. Technician Wu took the car back to the province that night to report back.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Gang Robbery; Police and Bandits Exchange Fire</h3>

This was learned by the local Public Security Branch, and Patrol Chief Peng led the police to suppress them, opening fire. The bandit leader also fired back, and the two sides held each other for three hours. As a result, the bandits were unable to resist and retreated. The police captured seven lake bandits, three bandit women, and four bandit boats. They were sent to the Wujiang Public Security Bureau on the 21st for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Cupping Causes a Fatality</h3>
<p>Yuan Hanwen, who specializes in broadcasting humorous songs on the Bailing Radio Station, has a thriving career of entertaining at gatherings every day due to his eloquent talent. He recently moved to No. 3, Shijia Alley. On the 20th, Ding Wanquan, a colleague from the Xinxingyuan Restaurant on nearby Linkan Road, suddenly suffered from acute cupping syndrome with severe abdominal pain. Accompanied by his colleague Xue Genquan, he was taken to Yuan's place to ask Yuan to perform cupping. However, as soon as the needle was inserted, Ding died on a rattan chair in Yuan's house. The police officer on duty immediately arrested Yuan. The deceased remained stiffly seated on Yuan's chair until 2 PM on the 21st. The viewers were constantly arriving and leaving, and the threshold was worn through. The police station sent police officers to take care of him.

<h3>Haimen: Thorough Investigation of Illegal Collection of Exorbitant Taxes</h3>
<p>The Niu Hong, Songji, Da'an, Qinglong, Lingdian, and other port areas of this county collect water and land police donations from passing travelers, as well as carrying force. The county people Yu Chanzhi and others requested the Jiangsu Provincial Donation and Tax Supervision Committee to send personnel to conduct a thorough investigation. The committee believes that the water and land police donations in various ports are exorbitant, disturbing the people, and the Department of Finance has long ordered them to be stopped. The carrying force has also been stipulated at 1.5 jiao per person and should not be requested extra. However, the ports and piers dared to collect them in violation of the order, which is illegal. The Department of Finance ordered the county government on the 18th to thoroughly investigate and punish them according to the law in order to avoid setting an example. The committee also believes that there are still illegal collections of the vehicle tax in Nantong, Haimen, and Qidong counties after the Department of Finance ordered the abolition. It has now sent investigator Shen Botao to Tonghai and Qidong counties to collect evidence for investigation.</p>
<h3>Pinghu: Tax Police Seize 30,000 Jin of Smuggled Salt</h3>
<p>The First District Brigade of the Zha Pu Tax Police learned on the 17th that salt smugglers in Si Dai were burning a large amount of smuggled salt and selling it outside the territory, so they secretly ordered their subordinates to go to various important roads to intercept them. On the 18th, they intercepted six smuggled salt boats at the Caishenmiao Bridge, three li south of the county seat. The smugglers did not resist and fled ashore. They immediately hired coolies to shake the boats to the team headquarters, counting more than 300 dans.</p>
<h3>Three Female Servers Poisoned</h3>
<p>The small taverns in this city have hired female servers for many years due to business relations. Recently, the Yuansheng Noodle Restaurant in front of the North Temple has also followed suit. On the 18th, Cui Laosong and Li Jingqing from Zhapu, and Wang Rongchun from this city, left the theater and agreed to have fun with the female servers (that is, to go to the female servers' place to drink). They went to the Yuansheng Restaurant to drink and chat. At first, they laughed and joked happily, but unexpectedly, at the end of the banquet, they felt unwell. Wang sent the two to the hotel and felt severe abdominal pain, unable to speak. Medical treatment was ineffective. On the 18th, Wang died. Cui and Li were still in danger.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Willow Waves and Orioles Song is a New Park</h3>
<p>The Hangzhou City Government previously designated the "Willow Waves and Orioles Song" area as a scenic residential area. Recently, it was ordered by the provincial government to plan and build a park in the area. Personnel were sent to investigate, taking the original road along the lake from Yongjinmen outside the lake entrance to the Qianwangtong statue as an example of being too close to the lake. The Huanhu Road in that area was ordered to be moved into the lake. It is planned to fill in a part of the land in the lake and develop it into a park. At the same time, the abandoned Huanhu Road line will be developed into a ten-foot-wide road, so that the park will be surrounded by roads in the future. Before the currently stipulated Huanhu Road is built, the lake transportation will also be connected. The high ground around the Qianwang Temple in Piyi can be reserved for building a park, but because the "Willow Waves and Orioles Song" base is only 1.8 mu, the land near the high ground is all private property. It is difficult to include it in the park. Therefore, it is planned to plant flowers and trees on the high ground of the Qianwang Temple and combine it with the "Willow Waves and Orioles Song" for consolidation. Adding the newly filled lake land mentioned above, there will be an area of more than eight mu, which is enough to develop a public area as a public tourist attraction in the Nanshan Road area. It is heard that Hangzhou City has made a plan based on this investigation report and submitted it to the provincial government, and first started to build roads and level the ground.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing: Kidnapped Victim Escapes Bandit Boat in Nanhui</h3>
<p>At about 6 PM on the 20th, the First Police Station of Tanghui Street, Jiaxing, suddenly received a report from a man with disheveled hair and short clothes, saying that he was Xu Weiqing, a 32-year-old surgeon from Nanhui County near Shanghai. On May 20th of the lunar calendar, he was kidnapped under the pretext of being invited to see a boil. For more than four months, he lived on a bandit boat. The bandits forced him to write a letter to his family, asking for a ransom of 20,000 yuan. Today, the boat was docked on the side of the Daqiao Bridge in Tanghe. Because two bandits who usually carried guns were going ashore to buy things, and the two bandits watching the victim were also asleep, he took the opportunity to go ashore and escape, following the road to this place, etc. The police station immediately reported to the police brigade by telephone to pursue and arrest the bandits in the Baibao Bridge area of Wangjiangjing Tang, but the bandit boat was not found. That night, the kidnapped victim was sent to the First Public Security Bureau for lodging. It was learned that the kidnapped victim's family still has an elderly mother, wife, three daughters, and one son. Director He of the Public Security Bureau has notified his family by telephone, ordering them to come to He County to pick up the kidnapped victim and reunite.</p>
<h3>Xinghua: County Government Gazette Expense Allocation</h3>

Before landing, Secretary Dern met with representatives of the Greater Shanghai Evening News in the ship's office. Secretary Dern was amiable and willing to have informal talks with ordinary people.

<h3>Senior Japanese Officials in Shanghai No Longer Hold Meetings, Had Talks at the No. 63 Garden the Night Before</h3>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reported that the three meetings of consular officials, military attachés of the army and navy, centered on representatives dispatched to China by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of the Army, and the Ministry of the Navy, have ended. Except for the consular meeting, which ended on the 19th, the two meetings of military attachés of the army and navy also ended yesterday morning. The joint meeting of the highest-level officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of the Army, and the Ministry of the Navy stationed in China will no longer be held. Because Ambassador Arima held a banquet at the No. 63 Garden on Jiangwan Road at 7:00 PM the day before to welcome the representatives Okamura, Honda, and Morishima, as well as the military attachés and consuls of the army and navy, opinions were exchanged and frank discussions were held at the banquet, and there was no need to hold another meeting. The following are the details of what Bii Eiichi, the spokesperson of the embassy, told the reporter of Xinsheng News Agency.</p>
<p>Arima Hosts a Banquet to Welcome Representatives</p>
<p>Japanese Ambassador Arima Akira hosted a grand banquet at the No. 63 Garden on Jiangwan Road at 7:00 PM the night before to welcome the three representatives dispatched to China by the Ministry of the Army, the Ministry of the Navy, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to convey their intentions, and to entertain the military attachés and consuls of the army and navy from various places who came to Shanghai to attend various meetings. Those present included Major General Okamura, representative of the Ministry of the Army, Colonel Honda, representative of the Ministry of the Navy, Section Chief Morishima, representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as Isoya, Hita, Wataru, Amemiya, Takahashi, Ishino, Nakai, Hattori, Kawamoto, Ichida, Oki, Hyakutake, Araki, Sato, Shimomura, Sugisaka, Suga, Nakahara, Nagai, Kitaura, Minato, Okino, and other military attachés and generals of the army and navy, as well as Ishii, Suma, Kawai, Sugiura, and other consuls. Counselor Arino and Secretary Horiuchi of the embassy were responsible for the reception. At the banquet, the three representatives of the Ministry of the Army, the Ministry of the Navy, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the senior officials stationed in China, frankly exchanged opinions and parted happily until 9:30 PM.</p>
<p>Military Attaché Meetings All End</p>
<p>The Japanese Army Attaché Conference in China continued to be held in the living room of the Japanese Army Counselor's Office at No. 923 Wuding Road at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. The attendees were still the 12 people including Major General Okamura. Outside the door of No. 923, Japanese military police and public security detectives were densely stationed, and the security was extremely tight. The meeting did not end until 12:00 PM at noon. It was heard that the military attaché conference also ended. The naval military attaché conference was held at the battleship Banshu at 4:00 PM the day before. It continued to be held on the ship yesterday morning at 8:00 AM. Those present included Colonel Honda, Vice Admiral Hyakutake, Araki, Shimomura, Sugisaka, three commanders, Sato Suga, Nakahara, Nagai, Kitaura, Minato, Okino, and other military attachés. Those who participated included 19 staff members of the Marine Corps and the Third Fleet. The meeting also ended around 12:00 PM.</p>
<p>Iwai Denies There is a New Policy</p>
<p>Regarding the holding of the above two meetings, the army attaché conference lasted for 12 hours, and the naval military attaché conference lasted for 6 hours. It can be imagined that the two meetings took a long time, discussed many issues, and the military attachés from various places reported in detail. However, according to Ishii Eiichi, the spokesperson of the embassy, the content of the two military attaché conferences was not as sensational as reported in the news. It was just a process of conveying the opinions of the four ministries of the army, navy, foreign affairs, and finance, and the opinions have been unified. On the other hand, it was to listen to reports from various parties, and there was no so-called new policy.</p>
<p>Officials from Various Places Return to Their Posts</p>
<p>Regarding the whereabouts of the special representatives dispatched to China by the Japanese Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs Ministries and the military attachés and consuls stationed in China, according to what the reporter of Xinsheng News Agency learned from the Japanese Embassy, Consul General Suma left Shanghai on the evening of the 20th. Section Chief Morishima and Secretary Horiuchi of the embassy will leave Shanghai tomorrow morning (22nd) and take the Qingdao Maru to Tianjin to attend the Tianjin Consul General Conference on the 25th. Major General Okamura, Military Attaché Usuda of Guangdong, and Consul Kawai have decided to take the Asama Maru to Guangdong on the 23rd to inspect. Vice Admiral Hyakutake will return to Sasebo on the same day. Lieutenant Colonel Hattori, the representative of Taiwan, will return to Taiwan by cruiser on the 24th. The remaining consuls and military attachés will leave Shanghai successively in the next few days and return to their original places of residence.</p>
<p>Ambassador Arima Will Not Leave Shanghai for the Time Being</p>
<p>According to another report from the reporter of Xinsheng News Agency, Ambassador Arima Akira has no preparations to go north, and the saying that Tada Shun, the commander of the Tianjin Garrison Army, came to Shanghai is absolutely untrue. However, it is said that Ambassador Arima will meet with our Ambassador to Japan Jiang Zuobin, who will return to his country from Japan on the 25th to report on his duties and attend the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, and then decide his actions after visiting Shanghai. Recently, Ambassador Arima has no important matters to discuss with our government authorities, so he will not leave Shanghai for the time being.</p>

<h3>Shanghai-Chengdu Express Flight, Maiden Voyage This Morning, Shanghai-Beiping Line Changes Schedule, Shanghai-Hankou Line Does Not Stop at Anqing</h3>
<p>World Aviation News Agency reported that in order to facilitate transportation between Shanghai and Chengdu, China National Aviation Corporation ordered a new type of Douglas giant aircraft from the United States, which was shipped to Shanghai at the beginning of this month and immediately actively installed. Now that the installation has been completed, it is scheduled to take its first flight at 7:00 AM this morning, passing through six stations along the way: Nanjing, Jiujiang, Hankou, Yichang, Chongqing, and Chengdu. It will fly west on Tuesdays and Fridays and east on Wednesdays and Saturdays. It will take eight hours to reach Chengdu from Shanghai. The one-way fare from Shanghai to Chengdu is 400 yuan, and the round-trip fare is 720 yuan. Also, the schedule of the Shanghai-Beiping line has been changed. In order to connect the Shanghai-Guangdong line and the Shanghai-Beiping line, the company has changed the schedule to fly to Beiping on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays, and to fly back to Shanghai on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays, starting this week. Because it was a temporary change, it was not announced to the public. All air mail sent by various parties and the aviation newspapers sent by this agency must be delayed once due to the schedule change. As for Anqing on the Shanghai-Hankou line, because the business is sluggish and there are few passengers, it has not landed at the station for nearly a month.</p>
<h3>First Special Court Rules that Huai Xing Li's Rent Should Be Paid at 80% of the Original Amount, Judging the Situation Fairly</h3>
<p>The case of the landlord Yuan Mao Company of Huai Xing Li on East Xihua Road in this city, and the tenants Lin Daozhi, Huang Jusen, Chen Xingxiang, Wang Xueming, Wang Yulin, and others, suing each other for rent payment, eviction, and rent reduction, has been judged by Judge Mo Runhua of the First Special District Local Court, and the rent is allowed to be paid at 80% of the original amount. The judgment has been delivered to both parties yesterday afternoon. The judgment of the court is recorded as follows: (Reasons) The fact that the defendants owed the plaintiff rent is undisputed. What should be investigated is whether the defendants' claim that the original rent should be reduced and collected is reasonable. It is clearly stipulated in Article 442 of the Civil Code that if the leased object is real estate, the parties may apply to the court to increase or decrease the rent due to the rise and fall of its value. The defendants claimed that the recent market decline and the sharp drop in land prices are undeniable facts. Although the Land Evaluation Register of the Engineering Bureau has not fallen, since the bankruptcy of the banking industry in the past six months has been mostly caused by the lack of attention to real estate. The real estate price in Shanghai today is very different from what it used to be, as everyone knows. Therefore, the defendant's request to reduce the rent cannot be considered unreasonable. Moreover, the rent of the houses to the left and right of the defendants' residence has been reduced, and the defendants have submitted rent receipts and other documentary evidence. The fact that the first defendant's rent was reduced early has also been proven by the witness Feng Guihe in court. Therefore, their claim should be recognized as legitimate. However, the defendants' request to reduce the original rent by 40% is too low, and the landlord's loss is also huge. The original amount should be paid for the rent in the year of 1934, which should be paid at the original amount of the previous year. Since January of this year, all should be paid at 80%. The defendants are ordered to pay the plaintiff the amounts shown in the main text. The plaintiff's request for overpayment and the defendants' remaining counterclaims should be dismissed. It is also found that the defendants temporarily stopped paying the rent because the rent reduction issue has not been resolved, and the rent has been deposited in the bank. Since each of them has submitted the passbook as evidence, it can be seen that they did not deliberately owe the rent, and the contract cannot be terminated and the house cannot be evicted. The plaintiff's eviction lawsuit should also be dismissed. Regarding the part of the rent owed, the plaintiff's agent has stated that he can provide a guarantee before the execution and apply for provisional execution. According to law, the court should determine a considerable amount of guarantee and announce that the provisional execution is allowed after the guarantee is provided. Based on the above conclusions, the plaintiff's lawsuit and the defendant's counterclaim are partially reasonable and partially unreasonable, and they should be approved or dismissed separately.</p>
<h3>Taxpayers Please Check the Established Cases and Handle Them in Accordance with the Uniform Standard for Property Tax After Rent Reduction</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association sent a letter to Philipp, acting director of the Public Concession Engineering Bureau, yesterday, saying, "According to a letter from Fukang Soy Sauce Garden at the intersection of Yangshupu Yangshou Road and Huasheng Road, 'The rent of our store has been reduced by 20% since February of last year, which has become a fact. The rent receipts are all there. For the property tax collected by the Engineering Bureau in the four seasons, it is natural to pay according to the original amount before the rent receipts are available, and there is no resistance. What happened last year has passed and is not a problem. However, it seems that the extra payments that have already been paid for the spring, summer, and autumn seasons this year should be removed in the winter. The case is corresponded and requested to your bureau to order the donation office to check the established cases and handle them in accordance with the uniform standard for the sake of your honor."</p>
<h3>Zheng Zena Visited Huang Jilu Yesterday, Shantou Representative Rao Dongming Has Arrived in Shanghai, Joint Banquet at Cuixiu Hall Tonight</h3>
<p>After the grain, bean cake industry opposed the Guangdong levy of bran surtax, stopped transportation and suspended work, it sent Gu Xinyi, Zheng Zena, and others to Nanjing to petition. Although the Ministry of Finance and other ministries telegraphed Guangdong to stop it, the Guangdong province continued to levy it as before. Since Central Committee member Huang Jilu arrived in Shanghai from Guangdong, the grain and bean cake industry specially sent Zheng Zena, a standing committee member of the grain association, to visit Huang Jilu at 7:00 PM yesterday to inquire about the Guangdong province's levy of bran surtax. The Shantou bean cake industry elected Cai Shifan, Tang Boyan, Rao Dongming, and other three people as representatives to petition Guangdong to abolish the bran surtax. Later, they waited in Shantou for the Shanghai representatives to go there so that they could petition together. Now, because the Shanghai representatives have not yet left, Rao Dongming was specially sent to Shanghai to contact them and has arrived. Gu Xinyi, chairman of the grain association, has scheduled a banquet at Cuixiu Hall on Fuyou Road at 6:00 PM tonight and will ask him to report on the tax collection process.</p>
<h3>The National Federation of Commerce Cables the Ministry of Finance: Stop Heavy Taxes on Saltpeter and Sulfur; The Fireworks Industry Greatly Affected, Impoverished People's Livelihoods Threatened; Swiftly Order the Wanzai Saltpeter and Sulfur Bureau to Levy Taxes According to Previous Regulations</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, stating, "We have recently received a cable from the Jiangxi Wanzai County Chamber of Commerce on the 30th, which roughly states: According to a cable from the Wanzai County Fireworks Industry Association, since the county has been plagued by bandits, the fireworks industry has stagnated and the economy has collapsed. The livelihood of the majority of the county's residents depends on firecracker handicraft. Therefore, the lightness of the saltpeter and sulfur tax rate greatly affects the livelihoods of impoverished people. Now, Director Wu Dingsong is taking over the Wanzai saltpeter and sulfur tax collection, increasing the tax rate to six yuan per hundred catties of saltpeter and four yuan per hundred catties of sulfur, which can be described as exorbitant taxes. Furthermore, the business license tax is also being increased as before, forcing them to obtain licenses, causing various fireworks factories to be unable to bear the burden and now completely shutting down. If this is not stopped, not only will the firecracker industry be devastated, but the rural economy will also be greatly affected. In the past, Wanzai firecrackers, during their peak, produced hundreds of thousands of yuan annually. Now, Hankou, Jingzhou, Shashi, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Foshan, and other ports have all been seized by Liuyang firecrackers. Zhangshu, Linjiang, Raozhou, and Leban have been seized by Xielu firecrackers. Ganzhou has been seized by Ji'an firecrackers. Currently, the only remaining sales market is a corner of Nanchang, with an annual output value of only over ten thousand yuan, and Zhejiang only has two or three tenths left. Therefore, we cable Your Association for review and request that you immediately forward this to the authorities for swift action to stop this, in order to relieve the suffering of the remaining people and maintain the real economy, which is of the utmost urgency. We await your response."</p>
<p>According to this, after the banditry in the county was suppressed, it was struck by a drought, the countryside is desolate, and the market is sluggish, which has reached its extreme. Now that the early rice harvest is near and the autumn harvest is expected, it is the time for recovery. However, the implementation of this matter will truly harm the places where work has been stopped. According to the information in the cable, we should cable for review and request that you forward this to the Ministry of Finance for swift correction, in order to ensure uniformity and compliance, and to avoid disappointment. We await your response."</p>
<p>Following this, we should cable Your Ministry for review and request swift orders to direct the Wanzai County Saltpeter and Sulfur Bureau to stop the heavy tax collection and continue to levy taxes according to previous regulations, in order to maintain the livelihoods of the common people, which is of the utmost importance.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce (with seal)</p>
<h3>Huang Shaoxiong Returned to Hangzhou from Shanghai Yesterday; He Did Not Go to Beijing After Arriving in Shanghai the Other Day</h3>
<p>Huang Shaoxiong, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, went to Shanghai from Hangzhou previously, intending to go to Beijing to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. However, he temporarily canceled his plans and still returned to Hangzhou from Shanghai yesterday at 11:30 AM, accompanied by his wife and others, in a private car via the Shanghai-Hangzhou highway. News reports that Huang arrived in Beijing the day before yesterday are actually inaccurate, as Huang did not go to Beijing.</p>
<h3>Tang Youren and Others Go to Beijing</h3>
<p>Tang Youren, Liu Weichi, Zhou Qigang, Wang Boling, Chuan Rulin, and others took the night express train to Beijing yesterday.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Public Safety Bureau Begins the Third Investigation of Smokers</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Public Safety Bureau took charge of the city's anti-smoking campaign, its work has been very intense. The anti-smoking propaganda campaign that the bureau began on the 1st of this month concluded on the 20th. Starting yesterday, the third investigation of smokers will be conducted, and it is said that this time it will be extremely strict, ensuring that no smoker is missed. Furthermore, the bureau will begin compulsory registration on the 1st of next month, so this investigation of smokers is actually the best opportunity for smokers to register voluntarily.</p>

<h3>The Truth About the Ma Family Property Dispute</h3>
<p>Ma Xiangbo has recently been involved in a lawsuit filed by his nephew's wife, Ma Lu, in court over property rights. The case has been heard again, with both parties' lawyers presenting their arguments in court. These events have been widely reported and have attracted attention from all sides, who believe that Ma, a highly respected man with virtue, who usually reveres religion and is enthusiastic about public welfare, and who even gave away his private farmland of four to five thousand mu to donate to an education fund, should not be involved in such a trivial matter to the point of litigation. In order to find out the truth, we conducted investigations from all sides. It is said that the old man had three brothers, with the old man being the second. They had already divided the family property and each received several thousand mu of inherited land. At that time, based on the division documents, each branch of the family allocated 300 mu of land as Ma's public property, which was only allowed to increase and not allowed to be mortgaged or sold. The annual income, in addition to covering the costs of repairing and viewing graves, commemorating and blessing ancestors, and helping orphans and widows, was entirely saved to add to the public property. Later, the old man donated all of his land and left nothing behind. The other two branches also gradually mortgaged and sold their land due to business failures over the years, leaving them with less than a thousand mu and in a precarious situation. The old man, as the clan leader, had a sense of responsibility to honor his ancestors and should be responsible for safeguarding the public property to prevent the gradual mortgaging and selling of it. Moreover, according to the will of Ding, the aunt of Lu, the eldest branch should also be supervised, and Lu had no right to interfere, let alone inherit or dispose of it, so there was no reason or possibility for the lawsuit. It is rumored that both sides hope to reach a settlement, but the old man's family absolutely denies this. The reason is that after Lu's husband, Xiaomei, died, he left behind heavy debts, and the widow and orphans are pitiful. Therefore, the income from this public property has been temporarily managed by the eldest branch, merely to supplement their needs, in order to fulfill the principle of helping oneself before helping others. Unexpectedly, Lu, instigated by others, falsely claimed it as private property in order to carry out her plan of occupying and selling it, resulting in the property rights dispute. It was not because Lu personally was unable to enjoy the income and property management that a settlement was needed or possible. Therefore, at the beginning of the dispute, although Zhang, Wang, and others were entrusted by the plaintiff to carry out mediation several times, no reasonable and concrete solution was reached, and the defendant side did not show any indication. Now that the litigation has begun, it is even more appropriate to wait quietly for the court's fair judgment. What was reported in the previous newspapers was by no means the truth. The facts are all there, and the truth will eventually be revealed.</p>
<h3>A Major Fire Destroyed Houses at the Intersection of Maigen Road and Kader Road Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Entire Fulai Barber Shop Was Destroyed; Part of Yongfeng Fruit Shop Was Burned</p>
<p>The Fulai Barber Shop, opened by Li Dehong from Yangzhou at No. 32 Maigen Road (Intersection of Kader Road) in West Shanghai, suddenly caught fire at 4:30 yesterday morning due to carelessness. The fire was very fierce. After receiving the news from the patrolman, he urgently called the fire department. By the time the fire truck arrived, the fire was already out of control, and the floorboards had been pierced through. The sundries upstairs then fell down with a loud crash, shaking the neighborhood. Nearby residents were all awakened. Yongfeng Fruit Shop at No. 30 to the left was also affected by the fire at the time. For a time, the order was chaotic. The Xinzha Police Station sent Chinese and Western detectives to the scene to suppress the situation. It was not until after 6 o'clock that the fire was extinguished. The Fulai Barber Shop had been completely burned down, suffering the heaviest losses. Part of the Yongfeng Fruit Shop was burned. Fortunately, the shop staff all escaped, avoiding a tragedy. Afterwards, the fire starter, Li Dehong, was taken away by the Xinzha Police Station to investigate the cause of the fire. When the fire spread, the vegetable vendors who came early to the Kader Road vegetable market from the Shanban Factory and Xinqiao in Zhabei could not pass through, and the traffic north and south of the creek was blocked for quite some time.</p>
<h3>Seizing the Secret Sale of Red Pills in a Fire-Damaged Empty Room; Wei Dachang and Yu Alin Each Sentenced to Three Months</h3>
<p>Wei Dachang from Shaoxing and Yu Alin from Ningbo recently helped a woman surnamed Tang secretly sell the drug red pills for profit in an empty house in Hongan Lane, Haining Road, which had been damaged by fire, and their business was quite prosperous. At 5:30 PM the day before yesterday, they were discovered by plainclothes Chinese detectives No. 851 and No. 1575, who arrested Wei and Yu, along with a suspect from Ningbo named Wang Along and a bag of red pills weighing half a pound, as well as a smoking pipe and lamp, and took them to the Hongkou Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. The lawyer of the Public Works Department, Zhang Shizhu, stated the facts of the case and requested investigation. Then, according to the reports of the two Chinese detectives clarifying the investigation process, Judge Xiao Bianfen questioned the three defendants and obtained clear confessions, sentencing Wei Dachang and Yu Alin to three months of imprisonment each. Before the execution of the sentence, they were first sent to a smoking cessation hospital for abstinence treatment for a period of one month or less. The red pills and smoking paraphernalia were confiscated, and Wang Alin was acquitted.</p>
<h3>Yang Xiji Foreign Goods Store and Others Are Suspected of Arson</h3>
<p>The Police Station Arrested Five Eastern Partners; The Case Is Still Under Investigation</p>
<p>Yang Xixian from Ningbo rented a house at No. 6, Lane 9, Taiwan Road, and opened the Yang Xiji Foreign Goods Store, with his fellow townsman Tong Binhou as the accountant and Hu Xiangsheng as an apprentice. He also rented the remaining rooms upstairs to his fellow townsman Xu Minghua to open the Baosen Shenzhuang. Xu's younger brother, Mingcai, followed his brother to learn the business. After opening, Yang insured his goods for 5,000 yuan with the Haohua Insurance Company and another 2,000 yuan with the Xiangtai Insurance Company. Xu also insured his goods for 1,000 yuan with the North America Insurance Company. Unexpectedly, at 4:30 AM on the 19th of this month, a fire suddenly broke out in the house. Neighbors were all awakened from their dreams and shouted for help. Soon, firefighters rushed to the scene with fire engines and drew water to put out the fire. Afterwards, Pang Ruiqing, the investigator from the Lao Zha Police Station in charge, and investigators Chen Ruisheng and Sun Dafa conducted a thorough investigation and discovered that there was a strong suspicion of arson to claim a large insurance payout. The Yang Xiji store only had goods worth 200 yuan, and the Baosen Shenzhuang only had a table and two chairs, which was obviously a sham. Therefore, the five eastern partners of the two stores were arrested together. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Local Court, where Judge Qian Hongye conducted the hearing. The police lawyer, Wang _____, briefly stated the circumstances and requested that Yang and others be detained for further investigation before prosecuting. The court then questioned Yang Xixiang and the other five people one by one. Yang claimed that he had returned to Ningbo on the 14th of this month and only rushed to Shanghai after receiving the telegram about the fire, so he did not know how the fire started. However, Yang's accountant, Tong Binhou, claimed that the fire was a premeditated plan by Yang Xixiang and his accomplices who were at large, so Yang deliberately went to Ningbo in advance as an excuse to shirk responsibility. Furthermore, Yang's apprentice, Hu Xiangsheng, claimed that he was in a dream when the fire broke out and was rescued, and he did not know anything else. After reviewing the confessions, Judge Qian ordered Yang Xixiang and others to be remanded in custody for further investigation and questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>Judgment in the Case of the Smoking and Gambling Den Discovered in the Jue Lu Restaurant</h3>

They were ordered to be released on bail pending further investigation, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Qian Hongye presided over the continued hearing in the First Criminal Division. All the defendants, except Wang Sheng who was released on bail and did not appear, were present.

<h3>Collision Incident of Two Public Buses: Responsibility Needs to Be Clarified Urgently; This Unfortunate Incident Happened After the Successful Closing of the National Games; Both Responsible Parties Released Statements Yesterday</h3>
<p>—Rumors of Resignations by Zhang Dengyi and Jin Baoxian—</p>
<p>Everything at the National Games was going smoothly when a collision occurred between city-run and commercially-run public bus drivers on the closing day. The details have already been reported in yesterday's newspaper. The following is a continuation of the situation reported by a Central News Agency reporter:</p>
<p>Statement from the Responsible Party of the Municipal Public Works Bureau</p>
<p>According to the responsible party of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, after the opening of the National Games, the number of people coming and going increased sharply, and the existing Zhabei Chinese-run public buses were insufficient to meet the demand. Therefore, the bureau transferred a portion of the South Shanghai public buses to serve Zhabei. Unfortunately, on the closing day of the National Games, a collision occurred with the Chinese bus side. On the city-run bus side, in addition to Deputy Director Jin Baoxian being injured, five drivers and ticket sellers were also injured. Deputy Director Jin's injuries are relatively minor and he is temporarily resting. The other five people have all been sent to Qu Zhifu Hospital for treatment. Two of them are in critical condition. However, the occurrence of this incident was entirely due to a misunderstanding. In addition to reporting the details to the seventh-level authorities, the bureau also hopes that this matter will not be expanded.</p>
<p>Statement from the Responsible Party of the Chinese Bus Company</p>
<p>According to the responsible party of the Zhabei Chinese Public Bus Company, the company was very surprised by the unfortunate incident that occurred. Fortunately, the seven injured are not seriously injured. After being sent to Renji Hospital for treatment, their injuries have gradually lessened. However, the responsibility for the occurrence of this dispute still needs to be fairly investigated by the authorities. The company has now reported the details to the Municipal Public Works Bureau and informed the Long-Distance Bus Company Association to uphold justice. The company is particularly disturbed because the collision between the two sides frightened passengers and even caused injury. The company must solemnly express its regret. The truth of the matter will be judged fairly by society in the future. There is one more point that needs to be stated: it is rumored that the company dispatched a bus on the afternoon of that day carrying more than twenty drivers to the vicinity of East Sports Road to beat up the city-run bus drivers and ticket sellers. This is actually a misrepresentation. At that time, there was a shortage of vehicles for all departures, so how could there be extra vehicles?</p>
<p>Both Sides' Routes Return to Their Original State</p>
<p>Since yesterday, the South Shanghai Public Bus Management Office has ordered the buses temporarily transferred to Zhabei to return to their original routes in South Shanghai. The vehicles of the Zhabei Chinese Public Bus Company from Zhabei to the stadium have also been reduced and have returned to their original routes. Therefore, it can be hoped that this matter will not cause further disputes and cause anxiety to passengers.</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Works Bureau Discusses Response</p>
<p>Since the collision occurred the day before yesterday, Xu Peihuang, Director of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, immediately ordered the responsible personnel to investigate the details of the incident. The injured personnel of the city-run buses were sent to the hospital for treatment. Yesterday afternoon, he convened a temporary emergency meeting to discuss concrete measures to deal with this matter. However, the content of the measures has not yet been announced by the bureau. According to a reporter's inquiry from a certain source, the incident occurred during the National Games, so Zhang Dengyi, Section Chief of the Fourth Section of the Municipal Public Works Bureau and concurrently Director of the Transportation Division of the National Games, has reportedly offered his resignation. Jin Baoxian, Deputy Director of the Public Bus Management Office, was also present when the incident occurred. Unexpectedly, this unprecedented disaster was caused, and he has also expressed his intention to retire.</p>
<p>Zhang Dengyi's Written Statement</p>
<p>According to the written statement sent by the Public Works Bureau from Zhang Dengyi, Director of the Transportation Group of the National Games, the large number of spectators at this National Games was anticipated in advance. Therefore, the National Games consulted with the relevant bureaus of the city to prepare in advance. Except for the afternoon of October 10, when there were some difficulties due to rain, the other ten days were generally able to cope. This was all due to the assistance of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, the Public Safety Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, the Public Utilities Bureau, various public bus and long-distance bus companies, and various commercial car companies. I would like to express my sincere gratitude on behalf of the National Games. The collision between the drivers of the Chinese public buses and the city-run public buses on the closing day is very regrettable. Although Zhabei is the exclusive operating area of the Chinese Public Bus Company, the company does not have many vehicles. Usually, in the city center, when there are major events, transportation is already inconvenient. Therefore, for this grand event, it was expected that there would be many spectators and that the company's vehicles would not be able to cope. Therefore, the Shanghai-Minhang, Shanghai-Taicang, Shanghai-Songjiang, and Xihu Long-Distance Bus Companies and the City-run Public Bus Management Office were consulted in advance for assistance. A total of forty-seven vehicles were provided: six Shanghai-Taicang buses, three Shanghai-Minhang buses, one Shanghai-Songjiang bus, twenty Xihu buses, and seventeen city-run buses. This was to alleviate the transportation of the大会 and should not be regarded as competing for business. The four types of vehicles from Shanghai-Taicang, Shanghai-Minhang, Shanghai-Songjiang, and the city-run, drove on the same route, and the bus stops and routes at both ends have never been moved. The report that they were moved is not consistent with the facts. As for the report on the 21st that the overturning of a bus was due to the dissatisfaction of the citizens, it was reported that only the Chinese Public Bus Company had such an incident during the National Games. No other company's buses were reported to have caused incidents. Furthermore, the speed of vehicles traveling to and from the city center was limited by the large number of vehicles in front and behind, and they were mostly connected in a row. It was not possible for any particular vehicle to overtake other vehicles. As for the collision between the Chinese public bus and city-run public bus drivers, the Municipal Public Works Bureau is conducting a thorough investigation in order to deal with it fairly.</p>
<h3>The Bride Commits Suicide After Returning to Her Maiden Home in Ningbo; A Pair of Scissors Was Stabbed Into Her Throat Because the Groom Was Disappointed Due to Her Blindness in One Eye</h3>
<p>Cheng Baimei, a resident of Yu Family Lane, about half a li west of Yangjing Town, Pudong, had a son named Longsheng, who worked as a laborer. Since childhood, his parents had arranged a marriage through a matchmaker with Zhao Baba's daughter, Xinying, from the nearby area. Now that both the man and the woman have grown up and reached the age of marriage, they chose the 18th of this month according to the lunar calendar as the wedding date. At that time, they held a grand banquet and welcomed Zhao's daughter into their home. The next day (the day before yesterday) in the morning, according to local customs, the bride and groom should go to the bride's home to pay their respects, which is commonly called "returning to the maiden home." At about 4:00 PM, they still returned to the groom's home. Unexpectedly, after the bride entered the room, she closed the door tightly. The family thought she was changing clothes, so they did not suspect anything. At about 5:00 PM, when it was almost dinner time, there was still no movement in the room. They called out but received no response. The family was shocked and quickly tried to open the door. They saw the bride lying in a pool of blood. They found that a pair of scissors had been stabbed into her throat between her neck, deeply piercing about an inch and cutting off her throat. The scene was extremely tragic. They immediately reported to the Yangjing Police Station, which instructed the local security officer, Cheng Zhiwen, yesterday morning to report to the local court. In the afternoon, a prosecutor was dispatched to the scene to examine the body and determined that it was indeed a death caused by injury. They instructed the family to collect the body first and wait for interrogation. After this newlywed murder occurred, it caused a stir in the surrounding areas. As for the reason for the suicide, it was said that the bride had recently become blind in one eye due to illness, and the groom's family did not know about it. After she entered their home, the groom was very disappointed. The groom refused to go with her when she returned to her maiden home, and he did not pick her up afterwards, causing the bride to return alone. Therefore, she felt ashamed and took this drastic measure.</p>

<p>It was recently reported that malignant malaria was found in Minhang Town, Shanghai. The Shanghai County Government specially instructed the Minhang District Office to investigate and report in detail in order to take preventive measures. After receiving the order, District Chief Wu Shifang thoroughly investigated on one hand and sent a letter to the Chinese Medical Association for assistance on the other. According to the association's reply, the number of malaria cases in the statistical analysis of the cases of each member has increased compared with previous years. After treatment, most of them have recovered within a week, which seems to be a seasonal disease and there is no dangerous discovery.

<h3>Shanghai National Goods Company: Court Suspends Auction; Liquidation Office Requests Mediation by the City Chamber of Commerce</h3>

<h3>10 Million Yuan Telecommunications Government Bonds: Mortgaged for 6 Million Yuan in Cash; Ministry Representatives Negotiating Smoothly in Shanghai; Banks in Shanghai Decide to Jointly Form a Syndicate to Underwrite the Loan</h3>
<p>According to New News Agency, the Ministry of Communications, in order to develop international and domestic telecommunications and other transportation infrastructure, decided to issue 10 million yuan in telecommunications government bonds this year, mortgaging them to banks in Shanghai for 6 million yuan in cash at a 60% face value discount for distribution. Regarding this loan, the Minister of Communications, Zhu Jia Hua, entrusted the Director of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, Shen Shu Yu, to conduct preliminary negotiations with the banks. Recently, Zhou, Section Chief of the Telecommunications Administration, was also sent to Shanghai to assist the bureau in its efforts. The New News Agency reporter learned from banking circles that the 6 million yuan loan secured by the government bonds is currently being discussed in preliminary talks between representatives of the Ministry of Communications and various banks, including the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Dalu Bank, Jincheng Bank, and Zhongnan Bank. It is hoped that the agreement will become a reality. However, since the amount is quite large, it will be necessary for a number of banks to share the burden. Therefore, negotiations will take some time. In the future, in order to facilitate repayment, the underwriting banks will jointly form a syndicate to handle the matter. The representatives of the Ministry of Communications plan to convene a meeting of the underwriting banks to discuss the contract after the negotiations with each bank are completed. The current progress is quite smooth, and it is expected that the contract can be formally signed and payment can begin soon.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Answers Questions on Documents Subject to Stamp Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce issued the following two letters yesterday to answer questions on documents subject to stamp tax:</p>
<p>Letter to Grain Depot: The Chamber replied to the Chambers of Commerce of Huian, Mei, and other towns, stating that it had received a letter dated the 19th of this month concerning the practice of grain merchants issuing depot receipts upon receiving rice for storage. These receipts are considered return receipts, and they are not used when the rice is retrieved in the future, so they are not collected and destroyed. The nature of these receipts differs from that of the depot slips used to retrieve goods. The Chamber inquired about which category of stamp tax should be applied. The Chamber checked Article 16, Clause 8 of the Stamp Tax Law, which lists "storage receipts" as a type of document. The nature column notes that all documents issued by stores, warehouses, or storage facilities to depositors for storing items are included. The nature of the depot receipts mentioned in the letter is the same as this clause, so it seems that stamp tax can be applied according to this clause. The Chamber is hereby informing you, and it is hoped that you will take note.</p>
<p>Temporary Goods Record Book: The Chamber replied to the West Gate National Goods Company in this city, stating that it had received a letter stating that the temporary goods record book, which is used for internal accounting and has no external relation, and contains no monetary figures, should not be subject to stamp tax. According to the Ministry of Finance's previous explanations, there is a distinction between internal and external documents, but account books are all used for internal auditing and are not used externally. Therefore, the old stamp tax regulations and the current stamp tax law both stipulate that if they are used for business, they should be subject to stamp tax, regardless of whether the account book records goods or money. The sample attached to the letter indicates the amount of goods received into the warehouse and the amount of goods paid to the retail department, which cannot be said to not be used for business. The inquiry that there is no need to pay stamp tax is a misunderstanding.</p>
<h3>Trial Opens for Huangpu River Female Corpse Case: Prosecutor's Investigation Clear, Formal Indictment Filed; Qiao Qi Guilty of Joint Homicide</h3>
<p>At 2:00 PM on August 3 of this year, when the Shengjing ship at Pier No. 3 of Swire Dock in the French Concession was leaving the port, the propeller stirred up a strange female corpse from the Huangpu River. The water police brought the corpse to the South Dock. A woman named Zhang Zhou Shi went to identify the body and confirmed that the deceased was her niece, Zhang Jin Lin. She then filed a lawsuit with the Procuratorate of the District Court, requesting a thorough investigation. Hao Zhong Yang, a dock worker, also reported to the water police that the deceased was pushed into the river and drowned, and he was willing to testify. The court ordered the police to accompany Hao Zhong Yang to the court and dispatched officers to take</p>
<p>Suspects</p>
<p>Qiao Qi Shi, Qiao Su Tang, Chu Fu Qing and others into custody. Qiao Qi Shi was detained after interrogation, and Qiao Lian Tang and others were released on bail pending further investigation. After further investigation, the situation became clear, and a criminal indictment was filed. The indictment stated that the defendant Qiao Qi Shi knew the deceased Zhang Jin Lin. Zhang Jin Lin originally had 2,000 silver dollars, which she had been depositing in Chu Fu Qing's comb shop. Two years ago, Zhang Jin Lin and her lover, whose surname was Meng,</p>
<p>Failed in Business</p>
<p>and returned to their native Shandong. This summer, Zhang Jin Lin returned to Shanghai alone to ask Chu Fu Qing to withdraw her deposits. Because she was in a hurry to leave, she did not bring her deposit book with her. Chu Fu Qing refused to pay. After several negotiations, Zhang Jin Lin published a notice in the newspaper stating that the deposit book was lost and withdrew 260 silver dollars. Later, the defendant persuaded Zhang Jin Lin to withdraw all of her deposits from Chu Fu Qing, claiming that the 260 silver dollars that had been withdrawn were interest on the deposits.</p>
<p>A Dispute Arose</p>
<p>with Chu Fu Qing. The defendant also asked a neighbor, Hu Yang Yuan, to introduce lawyer Hu Feng Lian to negotiate with Chu Fu Qing and mediate the dispute. The defendant often changed her tone when she organized Zhang Jin Lin to go out. At around 11:00 PM on August 2 of this year, the defendant, along with two unidentified men and one woman, used a yellow car to lure Zhang Jin Lin to the wharf on the Huangpu River with the premeditated intention of murdering her. Then, a man with a black mole on his leg took off Zhang Jin Lin's trousers and pushed her into the Huangpu River. Another man held a gun</p>
<p>To Prevent Outcries</p>
<p>The defendant and another woman sat by and watched. After Zhang Jin Lin was pushed into the river, the defendants fled. The next day, customs police recovered Zhang Jin Lin's body. An examination determined that she had indeed died from drowning. According to the testimony of the deceased's aunt, Zhang Zhou Shi, the defendant was arrested and questioned about the circumstances of the case and was prosecuted according to law. Although the defendant Qiao Qi Shi refused to admit to the joint homicide, Hao Zhong Yang's testimony was vivid and detailed. Moreover, the clothes that the defendant was wearing when she was arrested and the clothes and socks on Zhang Jin Lin's body were all preserved. However, her</p>
<p>Lower Body Was Without Trousers</p>
<p>This matched what Hao Zhong Yang had described. Combined with Zhang Zhou Shi's testimony that Zhang Jin Lin had previously said that the defendant would not let her out and that someone wanted to kill her, the defendant was indeed guilty of the crime under Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Wu Xiang Zu opened the Thirteenth Court to hear the case. Attorney Fang Jun Jie, who had been appointed, appeared in court to defend the defendant. The judge ordered that Qiao Qi Shi, who was in custody, be brought to the court for questioning. She testified that she was 43 years old, from Yangzhou, and lived at No. 18 Huaixian Lane in the Old County Front.</p>
<p>Her Former Husband Was Deceased</p>
<p>She is currently having an affair with Qiao Lian Tang, the owner of Qiao Shun Chang Hat Shop. She met the deceased at a young ladies' home (i.e., Chu Fu Qing's home). She firmly denied the plot to murder Zhang Jin Lin. Then, Cheng Yong Nian, a detective from the water police station, recounted the events after the incident. Finally, Zhang Zhou Shi testified that she was 60 years old, from Shanghai, and lived at No. 2 Hengde Lane, Fuyou Road. Zhang Jin Lin was the daughter of her third sister and was her niece. She returned to Shanghai in early April and stayed at Qiao Qi Shi's house for a few days (Qiao Qi Shi is the sister-in-law of Chu Fu Qing's fourth concubine). On the night of the incident, around 9:00 PM, Zhang Jin Lin went outside to cool off at my house. I don't know how she was murdered. I request justice. After hearing the testimonies, the judge stated that the case was complex and would be continued at a later date. Qiao Qi Shi was returned to custody.</p>

<p>In order to aid domestic mining, the Ministry of Industry established a 10 million yuan loan from the Shanghai Syndicate and established the Mining and Finance Adjustment Committee to oversee everything. The mining merchants have been applying for loans to the Ministry of Industry. The Ministry of Industry then handed over the application to the Mining and Finance Committee for examination.

The investigation is nearly complete. A committee meeting will be convened, after which the Ministry will be notified with the results for its approval.

The capital is 600,000 yuan, with the entire production of the local fishing depots as collateral. The local financial circles will underwrite 300,000 yuan, and the remaining half has been approved by the Construction Department from various banks. The Bank of China in this city had previously invested in the fishing industry at the behest of the Director, Chen Gongbo, and therefore actively approved the investment. The six banks, namely the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Zhejiang Local Bank, the China Industrial Bank, the Shanghai Siming Bank, and the China Farmers' Bank, each invested 50,000 yuan. The contract can be formally signed within the next few days.</p>

<h3>Dongtai Business Tax Bureau: Forced Cotton Tax Causes Repercussions; Cotton Mill Association Cables Finance Department to Intervene</h3>
<p>The Chinese Cotton Mill Association telegraphed the Jiangsu Finance Department yesterday, stating: "To the esteemed Zhao, Director of the Zhenjiang Finance Department: According to letters from Changzhou Dacheng Textile Company and Wuxi Mofeng Textile Company, our mills have established cotton purchasing offices in Datongji, Dongtai, to purchase raw materials solely for our own use. This was previously approved by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, which issued branch licenses, and was also submitted to the Jiangsu Finance Department for record-keeping. Now, according to letters from our cotton purchasing offices, the local Business Tax Bureau has repeatedly demanded the payment of business tax since the new cotton crop was introduced this year and purchasing began. Despite presenting the Ministry of Industry and Commerce licenses and Finance Department approvals, they were ignored and transport permits were denied, preventing the transport of already purchased cotton. Their intention is to make it difficult for the mills to meet their needs, forcing them to comply with their coercive demands. They have even threatened to collect taxes directly from farmers in front of the cotton purchasing offices if they cannot obtain them from the offices. Our mill's cotton purchasing offices in Datongji fully comply with the Ministry's regulations on exempting cotton purchasing offices of cotton mills from business tax and the Department's regulations on auditing and exempting cotton mill cotton purchasing offices from business tax. There is absolutely no obligation to pay business tax. Moreover, farmers who grow and sell their own cotton have no reason to pay business tax. This contradicts the intention of protecting farmers, and our mills will suffer unexpected losses. Therefore, we respectfully submit this letter, requesting you to forward it for intervention and issue transport permits according to regulations, to maintain the law and alleviate commercial difficulties, etc." The message continues, "We have investigated that the two factories have set up purchasing stations in the production area to purchase cotton, and have complied with the Ministry's orders and the Department's regulations on exempting business tax. However, the Business Tax Bureau still enforces the law with undue strictness, even collecting taxes directly from cotton farmers in front of the cotton purchasing offices. This is no different from treating business tax as likin, which is prohibited by law. We earnestly request you to promptly issue strict warnings to the business tax bureaus of various counties and to refrain from further harassing the cotton purchasing offices of various textile companies, in order to maintain the rule of law and alleviate commercial difficulties. We await your urgent command."</p>

All Ningbo shipping merchants admire him. The sudden news of his dismissal has caused widespread consternation. We have already jointly petitioned the Ministry. We have learned that Director Zhou was slandered by petty individuals and ordered to be dismissed, which is even more astonishing. In addition to telegraping the Ministry again, we sincerely ask you to consider the difficulties of the shipping industry in our hometown and urgently telegraph Minister Zhu to withdraw the order and send an impartial official to Ningbo to thoroughly investigate and clarify the truth." Signed, Ningbo Shipping Chamber of Commerce, Steamship Industry Association, and all Shipping Companies. The second telegram states: "(Above omitted) With the telegrams sent, Director Zhou of the local Maritime Affairs Bureau has been wrongfully dismissed due to slander by a dismissed employee, Ye Shenwei. All Ningbo shipping merchants have repeatedly telegraphed and appealed, and have sent representatives to Beijing to request the withdrawal of the dismissal order. Now that it has been confirmed that Zhou was wrongly framed by Ye, and fearing that the new appointee will soon arrive in Ningbo, in addition to directly telegraping the Ministry of Communications, we earnestly hope that you will consider the shipping industry in our hometown and quickly telegraph Minister Zhu to instruct both the new and old Directors, Jiang and Zhou, to postpone the handover, in order to appease public sentiment." (Same signatories) It is reported that the Ningbo Association will hold a meeting to discuss ways to retain Zhou.</p>

<h3>(Snippets)</h3>
<p>— (Rustic Elder)</p>
<p>Remembering the drastic changes in the world and the great disaster of today, even with outstanding talents, it is difficult to reverse the turbulent tide. Those who believe in fate consider it the Jiazi year of the lower cycle; those who worry unnecessarily only lament in vain. I believe that "The Book of Changes" says, "When things reach an end, they change; when they change, they flow; when they flow, they endure." This is an unchanging teaching, so why be sad!</p>
<p>The Song Dynasty was destroyed by the Yuan Dynasty, and the Ming Dynasty was destroyed by the Qing Dynasty. For hundreds of years, the vast Chinese territory was lost to foreign peoples. However, they all soon restored the old order and returned our rivers and mountains. Now, some people console themselves with this, which is a great mistake. Are not Korea and Taiwan lost forever? Today's situation is different, and the methods of subjugation are harsher. How should the people of the country save themselves?</p>
<p>Our country is like a rich, elderly widow. Person A, a charlatan, covets her wealth and seduces her. Fearing that charlatans B and C will interfere, he treats them as forbidden topics, jealous and threatening in every way. Alas, the situation of this rich, elderly widow is truly precarious!</p>
<p>Looking broadly at historical mirrors, both Chinese and foreign, we can see the causes of rise and fall, success and failure. How should the court and the people encourage themselves?</p>
<h3>Ancestral Shrine of Cotton</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>Looking at the cotton cloth I am wearing, I am reminded of Huang Daopo, who first planted cotton in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Huang Daopo lived at the end of the Yuan Dynasty. Her hometown was Wunijing in Shanghai. She lived in the Fujian and Guangdong areas for some time and secretly learned the methods of planting cotton and weaving cloth from the locals. When she returned to Shanghai, she brought back many cotton seeds. In addition to planting them herself, she also distributed the seeds to others and taught them the methods of spinning and weaving. In this way, women in the surrounding villages learned how to spin and weave. This indeed found a productive industry for women, and her contribution was truly great. Later generations did not forget her merits and built an ancestral shrine of cotton to commemorate her.</p>
<p>However, I saw in a textbook published by a certain bookstore that the Ancestral Shrine of Cotton is now abandoned and cannot be traced. This is somewhat incorrect. According to records, the Ancestral Shrine of Cotton is located behind the Longmen Academy in the west gate of Shanghai. The main hall has a veranda, and four phoenix trees are planted in the courtyard. In the center of the hall is a statue of Huang Daopo with a kind and gentle face, demonstrating her achievement of benefiting the people. Two maids are sculpted on either side, standing respectfully. Later, the Longmen Academy was converted into a normal school. Due to insufficient school buildings, the site of the shrine was included in the school. However, the main hall and the statue of the god were not damaged in the slightest. Several flat houses were built in front of the hall to serve as sickrooms for the students. The main hall served as a dining hall for the patients. The remaining houses on both sides were used as residences for the school staff. In this way, the shrine was isolated from the outside world, and it was not well known or accessible. After 1927, the normal school buildings were converted into the junior high school of the Shanghai Provincial Middle School, and the shrine was still included in the school's sphere of influence. Last year, after the Shanghai Middle School moved into its new campus, the entire original campus was auctioned off, and the Ancestral Shrine of Cotton was of course included. However, a group of protectors of ancient sites proposed that the Ancestral Shrine of Cotton be demarcated, repaired, and maintained. It is not known whether this will be implemented.</p>
<h3>Opening Remarks</h3>
<p>— Feng Moni</p>
<p>Everyone who works in society needs to understand opening remarks. What are opening remarks? They are the meaningless, trivial greetings you exchange with friends when you meet, the so-called perfunctory remarks, which are also opening remarks.</p>
<p>It is certainly not good for two people to meet and remain silent like mutes. Therefore, there must be opening remarks to perfunctorily fill the silence. However, some people's opening remarks are somewhat comical. For example, someone goes to the latrine to relieve himself and meets an acquaintance, and says, "You're relieving yourself!" The other person replies, "You're relieving yourself too!" Because they both need to relieve themselves, they both come to the latrine. There is definitely no one who has the leisure to go to the latrine to smell the fragrance of wood buds, and no one with such a good appetite. Such perfunctory opening remarks seem too humorous.</p>
<p>Some people go to the bathhouse to take a bath and see a friend lying naked on the couch. They still perfunctorily say, "Are you bathing?" (Wu dialect) Thinking carefully, it is truly laughable to foreigners. No one in the world is so foolish as to admire antiques in a bathhouse as if it were a museum. Such perfunctory opening remarks are really unacceptable.</p>
<p>The term "opening remarks" comes from the fact that when actors come on stage in the theater, they do not start singing immediately, but first play an introductory tune, and then sit down and recite four lines of poetry. This is called the "opening remarks." Today, people think that saying the first words to someone is called "opening remarks."</p>
<p>I am not good at meaningless perfunctory remarks and do not understand the mystery of opening remarks. When I see a friend, I actually get dizzy, which means I understand the meaningless perfunctory opening remarks, but I still can't bring myself to say them, because they are really meaningless empty words.</p>

<h3>Same Rooftop</h3>
<p>— (Drunken Woodcutter)</p>
<p>People in the city seem to be tired of living on the ground, so they have started rooftop gardens, rooftop dance halls, rooftop movie theaters, and rooftop wine shops. In general, young men and women are all carefree and happy on the rooftops. But when we look at the tragic situation in the disaster areas, countless suffering people are waiting for rescue on the rooftops, sleeping on the rooftops, and weeping on the rooftops. The white waves on the ground rise to the sky, but they cannot get down to the ground. In contrast, the same rooftops are one of gilded pleasure and the other of heartbreaking misery! I hope that the people in the city, while enjoying themselves on the rooftops, will think of the refugees on the rooftops in the disaster areas and generously donate to help them. That would be truly meritorious!... This is what Yangzhou storyteller Wang Shaotang told us on the East China Radio Station. At the same time, I also hope that all radio stations can promote this in the same way!</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 20: Scrambling for Life to See Grandson; Embracing Each Other and Weeping; Remembering the Past in the Famine Year; Sowing Wheat and Inviting Disaster</p>
<p>He smiled at them and said, "If there is anything, let your daughter tell me slowly. "As he spoke, he turned to Yueying and said, "Just tell me. Maybe I can help you a little." Yueying looked at her grandmother and said, "Grandma, you can lie on that bed for a while. We paid money to rent this room, and everything in this room today is ours." Zhu Hushi walked forward and supported her, saying, "Mother! You are not feeling well, so you should lie down!" Old Lady Zhu followed her daughter-in-law's support, and her body fell downward, her hand supporting the soft, sunken rattan backing of the bed. She grabbed Zhu Hushi's clothes in fright and sat up again. Yueying said, "It's okay for now. It's more comfortable for you to lie down than in our earthen kiln!" Mrs. Zhou said, "Don't worry about them. Tell me your story." Seeing that her grandmother was already lying down and her mother was sitting on the edge of the bed, Yueying first sighed and said to Mrs. Zhou, "We are not low-class people who sell our children." We used to farm and raise livestock in Gansu and lived a very peaceful life. My father left us when he was only thirty-eight years old." Hearing about her husband, Zhu Hushi immediately shed two lines of tears like two thick crystal threads, falling straight down. She choked and said, "He didn't leave us! He was taken away by soldiers and tortured to death." Yueying straightened her face and said, "Mother, why are you so ignorant? This Mrs. Zhou..." As she spoke, her eyes looked at Mrs. Zhou with a look of terror. Mrs. Zhou smiled and said, "It doesn't matter. I am not a soldier. Just tell me your story. Even if I were a soldier, the soldier you are talking about is not necessarily me. Why would I blame you? Just tell me whatever you want to say." (345)</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— Original work by Princess Der Ling of Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Chapter 35: Ominous Signs</p>
<p>This deep autumn of the year was truly a special season that one could never forget. After September, the days gradually shortened, and the leaves on various trees began to fall. We, a group of people who had lived in the sacred palace for a long time, originally did not pay much attention to the change of each season, but this time we all felt a strange sensation. Although no one could clearly say what the reason was, everyone indeed felt it, especially the Empress Dowager herself. Perhaps it could be said that as the weather gradually cooled in late autumn, people's skin would naturally have a different feeling, which would also cause a corresponding reaction in their hearts. This explanation seemed reasonable, but we had certainly encountered the atmosphere of late autumn before, and why hadn't it had any impact in previous years, but this year suddenly caused this feeling? Moreover, the stimulation of this feeling was extremely sharp, making us feel uneasy all day long, as if great difficulties and great terror were about to befall us soon. However, everyone was only worried in secret and dared not express anything in words.</p>
<p>It wasn't until this incident happened that we realized that our palpitations were the most accurate premonition!</p>
<p>How exactly did this incident start? I only recalled it after the fact.</p>
<p>Among the flowers and trees in the imperial garden, the magnolia (i.e., jade magnolia) was not considered a rare or exotic variety, but there were still dozens of them planted. Every early summer, they would bloom with many flowers. It was just because they didn't have any special characteristics that we never paid much attention to them. By late spring, we would not easily glance at them. (441)</p>
<p>Rambling Remarks</p>
<h3>Further Discussion on Shop Signs</h3>
<p>— Yan Fusun</p>
<p>There is a grocery store in Shanghai's West District named "勃郎林" (Bólánglín), which can be considered peculiar. As far as I know, there is also a Chaozhou confectionery store named "勃郎林" (Bólánglín) at the intersection of Guangdong Road and Shilu Road, facing each other from afar, which is a rare coincidence. On Baoxing Road in Zhabei, there is also a biscuit shop with a sign that says "轟天雷" (Hōngtiānléi, Thunderous Bomb). There was also a laundry shop in Caojiadu that has already closed, named "一口劍" (Yīkǒu jiàn, One-Mouth Sword), which was bizarre and incredible, simply baffling.</p>
<p>A few years ago, there was even a joke in Zhabei, where there was a tin foil shop that almost had a vulgar name. Suddenly, a new shop sign was erected at the entrance of the shop, with the eleven large characters "上海冥國銀行鈔票發兌處" (Shànghǎi Míngguó Yínháng Chāopiào Fādùichù, Shanghai Underworld National Bank Note Exchange Office) written on it. Shanghai is directly under the Underworld, and the Underworld is parasitic in Shanghai. A financial institution that connects humans and ghosts like this may have a day of realization in five hundred years. After all, the times are different, and everyone thought it appeared too early. The government was furious, and the Underworld Bank was declared liquidated. As for the so-called banknotes, they have not been cashed to this day, and I'm afraid they have all been turned into ashes together with the tin foil.</p>
<p>Shanghai is full of travel agencies, with various names, too numerous to list. Among them, the more meaningful ones, in my opinion, are the following two. One is "源源" (Yuányuán, Source Source) on Second Ma Road, which takes the meaning of inexhaustible. It is both popular and elegant. One is "香賓" (Xiāngbīn, Champagne) on Third Ma Road (recently closed), Running Horse Champagne, everyone already has a deep impression in their minds. Now, the two characters "香檳" (Xiāngbīn, Champagne) are used homophonously as "香賓" (Xiāngbīn, Fragrant Guest), which is already clever, and the fledgling guests are all popular figures. There is a line in the rustic ancient style: "Guests arrive like fragrant liqueur", the two characters "香賓" (Xiāngbīn, Fragrant Guest) are even more poetic, and that feels extra flavorful.</p>
<p>Shanghai's pawnshops and pawnshops account for the most broken records in the national statistics. Walking out of the streets and alleys, you can meet Mr. "尚" (Shàng, Still) and Mr. "田" (Tián, Field) everywhere. The names of the pawnshops, with the two signs "兩濟" (Liǎngjì, Two Reliefs) and "兩宜" (Liǎngyí, Two Suitable), are the most accurate. The principle of benefiting others and benefiting oneself can be taken into account. There is a small pawnshop in Zhabei with a golden sign of "民生" (Mínshēng, People's Livelihood), which obviously takes the meaning of relieving the people's livelihood and implying adjusting finance. The intention is of course not blameworthy, but the elements of people's livelihood completely depend on Mr. Shang and Mr. Tian as the source of life. Temporarily fortunately "生" (Shēng, Live), but eventually tend to "死" (Sǐ, Die). Sure enough, during the January 28th Incident, the enemy's iron island's poisonous bomb shattered the entire people's livelihood sign.</p>
<p>Shanghai also has a strange kind of medium sign, less than five inches wide and less than one foot long. It looks small and insignificant, but its seductiveness is unmatched by any other shop sign. These small shop signs, according to the formula of birds of a feather flock together, are like scales and combs, either in the neighborhood of "羣玉清和" (Qúnyù qīnghé, A gathering of jade, pure and harmonious) or in the lane of "福致勤之" (Fú zhì qín zhī, Happiness comes from diligence). The strangeness of the so-called strange shop signs is often the crystallization of the talents of the foreign field. I once took a quick look and noticed three colorful banners. One is "奇俠" (Qíxiá, Strange Knight), one is "虫二閣" (Chóng èr gé, Insect Two Pavilion), and one is "非非" (Fēifēi, Non-Non). These names seem to be as mysterious as "勃郎林" (Bólánglín) and "一口劍" (Yīkǒu jiàn) on the shop signs. After I racked my brains, I finally captured them all in one fell swoop, without missing a single one. It turns out that the two characters "奇俠" (Qíxiá, Strange Knight) are dissected using my gourd fortune-telling method. It just turns into the four characters "大可夾人" (Dà kě jiā rén, Greatly able to trap people), an absolutely wonderful phrase, which can be called vicious. The two characters "虫" (Chóng, Insect) and "二" (Èr, Two) are suspected of being a symbol of boundless romance, which is also interesting. What makes people spit out tea is the screen of the literary tiger of the two characters "非非" (Fēifēi, Non-Non). The riddle of "非非" (Fēifēi, Non-Non) is "想入" (Xiǎng rù, Think enter). When connected to form a sentence, it is "想入非非" (Xiǎng rù fēifēi, Indulge in fantasies). People who indulge in fantasies can really be regarded as indulging in fantasies. I think Miss "非非" (Fēifēi, Non-Non) will definitely be unable to laugh or cry after reading this wonderful article.</p>
<p>Finally! I would also like to add a statement that I rely on selling articles and fortune-telling for a living, and the Ronglu fortune-telling that I created has been around for exactly ten years. The gourd question is located in the New World Hotel, only this one, and there are no branches. Recently, a friend from Hong Kong wrote to inform me that there is also "嚴鞭孫葫蘆測字" (Yán biān sūn húlu cèzì, Yan Bian Sun's Gourd Fortune-telling) in Hong Kong, and also stated that they came to Hong Kong from Shanghai. In fact, I have never left Shanghai. The Yan Bian Sun in Hong Kong is of course someone else. Sima Xiangru, whose name is Xiangru, is actually not Xiangru. I dare not steal the beauty of others. Because I have received inquiries from relatives and friends in Hong Kong and Guangdong, I will answer it incidentally. Also, there is also "嚴芙蓀測字" (Yán fú sūn cèzì, Yan Fu Sun's Fortune-telling) in Caojiadu in this city. (A grass head is added above the character "孫" (Sūn, Sun), which is a difference). There is also "小葫蘆測字" (Xiǎo húlu cèzì, Small Gourd Fortune-telling) in Nanyang Bridge, which has nothing to do with me, alas! Poor me! The difficulty of begging for food as a writer, I really can't bear to write any more.</p>

<h3>Corrections to National Games Announced Yesterday: Men's Swimming and Women's Tennis Rankings Adjusted; Men's Tennis Unchanged Due to "Valid Reasons"; Prizes Already Claimed, Re-Packed for Distribution</h3>
<p>The rankings and scores for men's and women's tennis and men's swimming announced at the 6th National Games contained errors. This newspaper made corrections yesterday. After these errors in swimming scores and women's tennis rankings were discovered, it was decided to correct them yesterday. However, regarding the men's tennis rankings, it was stated that there were no errors because the Games had its own views and reasons.</p>
<p>Corrected Men's Swimming Rankings</p>
<p>The organizing committee officially announced the corrected men's swimming scores yesterday. The Central News Agency issued the following announcement: "There were slight errors in the calculation of the scores for men's and women's swimming at this National Games. The Records Department of the Games hereby corrects them as follows:"</p>
<p>Men's Swimming Women's Swimming</p>
<p>Guangdong 57 points, won the championship Guangdong 62 points, won the championship</p>
<p>Hong Kong 50 points, won the second place Hong Kong 40 points, won the second place</p>
<p>Malaya 31 points, won the third place Guangxi 15 points, won the third place</p>
<p>Shanghai 12 points, won the fourth place Nanjing 3 points, won the fourth place</p>
<p>According to the above corrections, Shanghai is fourth in the men's swimming overall score, previously incorrectly reported as Guangxi. Therefore, Shanghai should get 27 points for the men's overall championship, while Guangxi has no points.</p>
<p>Corrected Women's Tennis Rankings</p>
<p>The errors in the women's tennis rankings were also first discovered by this newspaper. The fourth place should be Sichuan, not Malaya. After investigating the records, Sichuan got third in the women's doubles, and Malaya got fourth. Therefore, the first place is Shanxi, the second place is Shanghai, the third place is Nanjing, and the fourth place should be Sichuan. A prize has been notified to the prize department to be sent to Sichuan. Malaya had already claimed it. Men's swimming will also send a copy to Shanghai, as the silversmith had given it to Guangxi.</p>
<p>Reasons for Men's Tennis Rankings</p>
<p>As for the reasons for the men's tennis rankings, the Games' reasons are stated as follows: Whether it is fair or not, let's not discuss it for the moment. It is said that the determination of the tennis championship depends on the performance of a unit in singles and doubles. The singles and doubles must be good. Sichuan got fourth place in both singles and doubles, while Malaya only got third place in doubles and no ranking in singles. Therefore, Sichuan should be above Malaya. According to this statement, if one unit gets first place in singles and another unit gets two second places, the championship should belong to the latter. This point of Malaya's is related to the overall championship ranking, which involves too much, and it may not be convenient to correct it.</p>
<p>Errors Corrected in the General Report</p>
<p>The errors in the Games' score reports will be corrected in the general report. The Records Department issued a message yesterday stating that due to the urgency of time, there may be errors in the records of various events of the Games, which are not easy to correct. Therefore, the official results of the Games should be based on the Games' general report.</p>
<h3>National Games Jury Committee Discusses Shanghai and Beijing Protests Yesterday; Beijing Protests Shanghai Athlete Wei Dingyi; Resolution: Both Cases Require Further Investigation</h3>
<p>During the National Games, Shanghai protested that Nanjing athlete Yang Chunfu participated in the preliminary elections of two units. The jury committee held a meeting and decided to conduct an investigation. It is now known that the photos have been sent from Zhenjiang. The jury committee convened a meeting in the National Games Secretariat yesterday, with Wang Zhengting acting as chairman. At the same time, Beijing also protested that Shanghai men's volleyball player Wei Dingyi also participated in the Jiangsu preliminary election, requesting disqualification. The jury committee discussed the results and considered that the case still needs to be investigated. If the Games Organizing Committee ends, the findings will be reported to the Ministry of Education for approval.</p>

<h3>Athletes Depart from Shanghai One After Another; Thirteen Units Departed Yesterday</h3>
<p>The National Games has ended, and athletes from various units have set off from Shanghai one after another. Yesterday, those who left included thirteen units, including Shanxi, Henan, Beiping, Shandong, Qinghai, Jiangsu, Nanjing, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Tibet, Jiangxi, and Guizhou. They left Shanghai by boat and car. The Games dormitory is now mostly empty, and the scene is extremely desolate. There are still Qingdao athletes who are scheduled to leave Shanghai in two batches today.</p>
<h3>Wang Sisters' Tennis Flowers to Perform in Kaifeng Next Month</h3>
<p>(Kaifeng Communication) In recent years, the sports circles in Henan Province have paid extreme attention to tennis, and have spared no effort in promoting it. Last winter, Qiu Feihai and Zhang Dingzhao were invited to perform in Kaifeng. Later, the Henan Tennis Association was organized. This summer, the world tennis player Tierton was invited to Kaifeng but failed. Now, the tennis court built by the sports section of the Xinyun Club has been fully completed. The association has sent a letter to invite the national women's tennis masters, the Wang Chunqing and Wang Chunwei sisters, to perform in Kaifeng. It is heard that the Wang sisters have replied, saying that they can come to Kaifeng in early November. It is also heard that the Xinyun Club has set the ticket prices at 80 cents and 40 cents. At that time, those who have a tennis addiction in Kaifeng will be able to feast their eyes again.</p>
<h3>Flood Relief Football Match: Li Huitang and 40 Others Join</h3>
<p>At the request of the Shanghai Provincial Flood Relief Association, the National Games held a swimming performance yesterday (21st) at the Shanghai Municipal Swimming Pool in the city center for the purpose of relieving flood victims in various places. Ladies and gentlemen from all walks of life went to watch, and the response was unusually enthusiastic. According to a spokesman for the association, a football match is also scheduled to be held on the 26th, and the football king Li Huitang, Cao Guicheng, and others, a group of 40 people, will participate in full force, preparing the most beautiful football skills to arouse the interest of the audience and increase revenue. With such a gathering of talents, there will definitely be a grand occasion at that time. In addition, the association received a total of 174.5 yuan from Wang Yongji and seven other households, 2 yuan from Zhao Huaiting, the accountant of Shenxiang Pavilion, which was raised by the Chinese Buddhist Association, 100 yuan from Mrs. Ding, a total of 154.5 yuan from Baotaixiang and four other households, a donation to help with the funeral expenses of the Xu family, 50 yuan from Shi Yonggeng, 20 yuan from Yang Peijing, a donation to help with the birthday expenses of Mr. Lin Kanghou, a total of 105.45 yuan from eight households of the Xuyuan Cloth Factory, a donation to help with the funeral expenses of the Xu family, 20 yuan from Zhu Yinjiang, 400 pieces of old clothes and bedding from Feng Shaozhou and 18 other households, and 1,500 pieces of new clothes.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Athletes Participating in the National Games to Go to Beijing for Sightseeing by Early Train Tomorrow Morning; Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Sends Special Commissioner to Accompany and Receive the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>Among the overseas Chinese who returned to the country to participate in the National Games this time, there are three units: Malaya, the Philippines, and Java. The Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, in order to treat overseas Chinese preferentially, has sent a special commissioner to Shanghai to meet with Mr. Jian Jinglun, director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau of this city, to receive all the athletes from the three units of Malaya, the Philippines, and Java to go to Beijing for sightseeing. It has been decided that they will leave Shanghai for Beijing by early express train tomorrow morning (22nd), stay for about a week, and then return to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Charity Swimming Performance: Liu Baoxi Breaks National Backstroke Record with a Time of 1 Minute, 19.1 Seconds</h3>
<p>The charity swimming performance competition for the disaster-stricken people in various regions, organized by the All-China Games swimming athletes, was held at the city pool yesterday at 2:15 PM. In addition to the ten scheduled events, impromptu additions included high board diving and various butterfly stroke performances, all of which were highly entertaining. Liu Baoxi, the hero from the South, and Yang Xiuqiong, the "Mermaid," lived up to expectations by setting new records. However, the audience was only about 1,000 people, far fewer than the enthusiasm of the previous few days. Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Education Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan, and Xu Shiying, chairman of the various provincial flood relief committees, all graced the pool to watch the competition. The atmosphere at the poolside was quite heated, and the audience erupted in cheers at every exciting moment. The "Guoguang" reporter's detailed report on yesterday's competition is as follows:</p>
<p>Li Luomin Benefits from Sprint</p>
<p>The opening act yesterday was the men's 100-meter freestyle, a gathering of elites. It began at 2:27 PM with an air temperature of 77 degrees and a water temperature of 69 degrees. The participants included Shen Dingpeng from Malaya, Li Luomin from Hong Kong, Shi Jinpei from Guangdong, and Ren Mengxiong, also from Guangdong. Chen Zhenxing was unable to participate due to not finishing changing clothes. The starter, Guan Songsheng, held his gun ready to fire. Ren and Shi started early, and Commander Guan enforced the rules strictly, calling them back for a restart. The first two swimmers had already swam half a lap. After the restart, the strength of all four swimmers was equal in the first leg, with no clear leader. Shen Dingpeng's nimble turn gave him the lead, but Li Luomin's sprint was even better. At 75 feet, he surpassed Dingpeng and raced straight to the finish line, taking the lead by four feet. Shi from Guangdong followed closely in third place, four feet behind, with Ren from Guangdong in last place. The time was 1 minute, 11.8 seconds. At that time, the mayor was seated high on the podium, frequently asking if a record had been broken. However, due to the two starts with no rest in between, the competitors were physically exhausted; otherwise, a record might have been broken.</p>
<p>1. Li Luomin (Hong Kong) 1 minute, 11.8 seconds</p>
<p>2. Shen Dingpeng (Malaya) 1 minute, 13.6 seconds</p>
<p>3. Shi Jinpei (Guangdong)</p>
<p>4. Ren Mengxiong (Guangdong)</p>
<p>"Mermaid" Shows Skills in Women's 50 Feet</p>
<p>The second event was the women's 50-meter freestyle, with participants Sa Huiying, Chen Yuhui, and Yang Xiuqiong. To increase the interest, Huiying started one second before Yuhui, and Xiuqiong started five seconds later, to see if the "Mermaid" could catch up. After the gun fired, Huiying jumped into the water. Commander Guan silently counted the seconds beside her. At one second, he pushed Yuhui into the water. After another four seconds, he patted the "Mermaid's" tail and she leaped out with a splash. By that time, Huiying had already swam 20 meters, and Yuhui was not far behind Sa. The "Mermaid" was indeed miraculously skilled. As the water splashed, she surpassed Yuhui within 30 meters, earning a near-frantic cheer from the audience on both sides of the pool. The "Mermaid" increased her speed again, racing to the finish line. Huiying was also capable, and despite the strong opponent behind her, she calmly sprinted to the finish. Sa's hand touched the edge of the pool first, not allowing her to catch up, but the difference between them was only the height of a hand, not even an inch. Xiuqiong's time was 37 seconds flat, breaking her own national record of 38 seconds, but not matching her best time of 36 seconds in the All-China Games this year. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Sa Huiying (Hong Kong) 43.2 seconds</p>
<p>2. Yang Xiuqiong (Hong Kong) 37 seconds (Breaks National Record)</p>
<p>3. Chen Yuhui (Hong Kong) 43.7 seconds</p>
<p>Baoxi's Backstroke Skills are Astonishing</p>
<p>The men's 100-meter backstroke is Hong Kong's Liu Baoxi's specialty. He is considered the best in the country, with no one to challenge him. He arrived too late to participate in the All-China Games this time, and yesterday's charity competition was his first chance to show his skills. As expected, he made a splash, breaking the national record and the All-China Games record. It was truly commendable. Only four participants took part in this event yesterday: Lin Fuyu from Malaya, Shi Jinpei from Guangdong, Chen Qiqian from Hong Kong, and Liu. After the start, Liu's arms moved like lightning. At 20 meters, Liu had already taken the lead by five feet. Although Lin Fuyu tried hard to catch up, Liu was fifteen or sixteen feet ahead when they turned at 50 meters. Baoxi's speed was not only astonishing, but his swimming style was also the most modern rotating style. His body was exceptionally agile when he turned. His final speed was so fast that it was almost perfect. He finished seventeen meters ahead of Fuyu, with Shi more than ten feet behind Lin. The time was 1 minute, 19.1 seconds, breaking his own national record of 1 minute, 23.1 seconds and the All-China Games record of 1 minute, 23.5 seconds held by Lin Huijun from Malaya. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>(Breaks National and All-China Games Records)</p>
<p>1. Liu Baoxi (Hong Kong) 1 minute, 19.1 seconds</p>
<p>2. Lin Fuyu (Malaya) 1 minute, 36 seconds</p>
<p>3. Shi Jinpei (Guangdong)</p>
<p>4. Chen Qiqian (Hong Kong)</p>
<p>Xiuqiong Enters the Water Swiftly as an Arrow</p>
<p>Only the Yang sisters participated in the women's 100-meter freestyle. To maintain her strength, the "Mermaid" expressed her willingness to start nine seconds after Xiuzhen. When Xiuqiong entered the water, Xiuzhen had already swam past the 22-meter line. Many spectators on both sides of the pool were worried for the "Mermaid." Director Pan also said that the disadvantage was too great, and she might not be able to catch up. However, the "Mermaid" possessed exceptional skills. She leaped forward, swiftly as an arrow. When she turned at 50 meters, she was only five or six meters behind Zhen. The "Mermaid" swam faster and faster. At 90 meters, she had already passed Xiuzhen and taken the lead. She finished first, beating Zhen by three feet. The applause was thunderous, and the cheers sounded like a stampede of ten thousand horses. The time was 1 minute, 23.5 seconds, breaking her own national and Far East Games record. It was only 0.5 seconds slower than Yang's time at the All-China Games this year. It was extremely commendable and could only be achieved with true skill.</p>
<p>1. Yang Xiuqiong 1 minute, 23.5 seconds (Breaks National and Far East Records)</p>
<p>2. Yang Xiuzhen 1 minute, 37.1 seconds</p>
<p>Luomin Triumphs in the 400 Meters</p>
<p>The participants in the men's 400-meter freestyle were Wu Wenjian from Malaya, Shi Jinpei from Guangdong, and Li Luomin from Hong Kong. Their strengths seemed evenly matched at first. In the first two laps, they were neck and neck, swimming in a straight line. When turning at the third lap, Shi used his feet to push off the wall, slightly taking the lead. Li and Wu then strove forward, and at 250 feet, the two were neck and neck, leading by more than ten feet. In the final lap, Li Luomin relied on his agile turns to shake off Wenjian and accelerated his sprint, reaching the finish line in a blink of an eye, defeating Wu by about nine feet. Jinpei's strength waned, and he finished more than a foot behind Wu. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Li Luomin (Hong Kong) 6 minutes, 28.7 seconds</p>
<p>2. Wu Wenjian (Malaya) 6 minutes, 37.1 seconds</p>
<p>3. Shi Jinpei (Guangdong)</p>
<p>Hong Kong Wins the Four-Stroke Relay</p>
<p>The men's 200-meter relay was temporarily changed to a four-stroke relay, in the form of a Hong Kong-Guangdong contest. In the first leg, Hong Kong was represented by Liu Baoxi, and Guangdong by Su Tianmo. In the second leg, the breaststroke, Hong Kong was represented by Chen Fuxing, competing against Guangdong's "Frog King" Guo. In the third leg, the sidestroke, Hong Kong's Zeng Hefu met Guangdong's Chen Qisong. In the fourth leg, the freestyle, Hong Kong used Li Luomin, and Guangdong used Ren Mengxiong. At the sound of the gun, Liu and Su leaned back and swam forward. How could Baoxi's throne be usurped? He beat Su by more than five feet. In the second leg, Hong Kong's Chen Fuxing started first, with "Frog King" Guo trailing by five or six feet. Midway, the "Frog King" displayed his exceptional skills, gradually closing in. In the end, the disadvantage was too great, and Fuxing was not a weakling either. At the end of the second leg, the Guangdong team was still more than two feet behind. In the third leg, the sidestroke, Hefu was stronger than Qisong, leading by another four feet. In the final leg, the freestyle, Mengxiong and Luomin fought fiercely. Luomin took the lead first, and with the advantage he had from the first three legs, he easily won. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Leg 1 Leg 2 Leg 3</p>
<p>(Hong Kong Team) Liu Baoxi (Backstroke) Chen Fuxing (Breaststroke) Zeng Hefu (Sidestroke)</p>
<p>Leg 4</p>
<p>Li Luomin (Freestyle) Time: 2 minutes, 25.8 seconds</p>
<p>(Guangdong Team) Su Tianmo (Backstroke) Guo Zhenheng (Breaststroke) Chen Qisong (Sidestroke)</p>
<p>Ren Mengxiong (Freestyle) Time: 2 minutes, 30.4 seconds</p>
<p>Ou Enzhao's Breaststroke Creates a New Far East Record</p>
<p>The 200-meter breaststroke was held jointly for men and women. The focus was on whether Ou Enzhao could break the Far East record. Yang Xiuzhen also joined as a pace swimmer, but using the freestyle. On the men's side were Fang Zongyu from Hong Kong, Guo Zhenheng and Wang Yaomin from Guangdong. Within 50 meters, Wang and Fang were in the lead, with Guo second. Ou and Yang were side by side in the rear, but less than a foot apart. After the turn, Fang was four or five feet ahead. Little Guo steadily closed the gap, but without effect. Xiuzhen, as always, did her own thing, approaching little Guo and keeping pace with him. Ou, due to her small stature, was still a foot behind. In the third leg, Fang gradually pulled away. Xiuzhen closed in on Yaomin, while little Guo, due to excessive fatigue from the relay, did not try very hard, walking hand in hand with Ou Enzhao, even more intimately. In the fourth leg, Fang pushed forward, reaching the finish line twelve feet ahead. Wang Yaomin finished ahead of Xiuzhen by a hand, while Guo and Ou were more than ten feet behind. Ou achieved a time of 3 minutes, 52.2 seconds, breaking Chen Huanqiong's Far East record of 3 minutes, 58 seconds, but not breaking Xiuqiong's national record of 3 minutes, 41 seconds, because the national standard is higher than the Far East standard. On the men's side, because they were pace swimmers, their scores were not counted.</p>
<p>Ou Enzhao 3 minutes, 52.2 seconds (Breaks Far East Record)</p>
<p>Three Performances are Miraculously Skilled</p>
<p>Yesterday's newly added programs included Chen Zhenxing and Zeng Hefu's butterfly stroke performance, with a distance of 50 meters. Zhenxing took the lead by one foot, timed exactly at 36 seconds flat. After the four-stroke relay, Chen Zhenxing also performed a 50-meter underwater swim, unofficially timed at 36.6 seconds. Underwater swimming cannot be done without real skill. It requires completing the entire length in one breath and being agile. The announcer specially explained this during Zhenxing's performance to show encouragement. Finally, Huang Xihan and Su Tianmo, the diving kings from the South, performed high board diving, including swallow style, sickle style, back bend style, half-turn entry style, backward somersault entry style, and synchronized double entry style, either like swallows skimming the water, tired birds returning to the forest, dragons soaring, or tigers leaping, with waves splashing and cheers erupting. Among them, the synchronized double entry style was the most popular with the audience. Such performances cannot be achieved without being proficient in this art, truly miraculously skilled.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Guangdong United Team Wins Water Polo Match</p>
<p>The most interesting water polo match was held after all the other events. The referee was Mr. Ye Guanyan. At the sound of the silver whistle, the athletes of both teams leaped forward. Zhang Rongguang, the forward of the Shanghai-Guangdong United Team, took the lead, carrying the ball straight ahead, invincible. Chen Fuxing, the defender of the Hong Kong-Malaya United Team, was unable to stop him. Rongguang swung the ball, hitting the target directly, less than a minute after the start of the match. At the center line kickoff, Shanghai got the ball again, passing it to the right forward Shi Jinpei, who passed it to Guo Zhenheng. After many passes, the ball returned to Shi's hand, and he scored again three feet from the goal. After the kickoff, Guo "Frog King," the center back, personally led the charge, heading to the front line to capture the flag, but the long-range shot missed. He advanced again and scored another goal. The Hong Kong-Malaya team suffered repeated losses. Although General Chen Ziqing was in the center, the team lacked fighting spirit, and their defenses were wide open. Chen Qisong charged forward and scored again. In a blink of an eye, the first half ended, with the Shanghai-Guangdong United Team leading 4-0. In the second half, both sides only played for one minute, feeling the water was too cold, and the game ended without a clear winner. The final score was 4-0, with the Shanghai-Guangdong team winning decisively. Overall, the Hong Kong-Malaya team's forwards also had many dangerous attacks on the goal, but they were all saved by Huang Jizhou and Zhou Yuanyun, the defenders and goalkeeper of the Shanghai-Guangdong team. The performances were wonderful, and there was much applause. The lineups are as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai-Guangdong United Team</p>
<p>Zhou Yuanyun (Shanghai)</p>
<p>Wang Xinmin (Guangdong) Wang Jizhou (Guangdong)</p>
<p>Guo Zhenheng (Guangdong)</p>
<p>Shi Jinpei (Guangdong) Chen Qisong (Guangdong) Zhang Rongguang (Shanghai)</p>

<h3>Sichuan Athlete Delegation Cables Thanks for Hospitality</h3>
<p>The Sichuan athlete delegation cabled this newspaper yesterday, saying: "To the Shanghai Shenbao, please forward to all newspaper offices, news agencies, organizations, and Sichuan compatriots: We will take the Minquan steamer directly to Chongqing tonight. We are deeply grateful for the warm hospitality and guidance we have received. Due to the hurried schedule, we were unable to say goodbye in person, and we apologize for this. We hope to continue to receive your guidance at any time. We wish you all the best and good health. Signed, all 75 staff and athletes of the Sichuan athlete delegation."</p>
<h3>Malayan Chinese Athletes Visited Jinan University Yesterday, Chinese Students Held a Welcome Reception</h3>

You know, Fuli Zi, I have deep sympathy for Nan'en, because I was such a naughty child at the time, so I know everything.

<h3>Finance: Although the Rumor of Indian Silver Rose Sharply, the Gold Standard Was Weak Before Becoming Strong</h3>
<p>Rumors of Reducing Silver Import Tax and Increasing Gold Export Tax in India; Once Broke Through the 50 Yuan Mark, Resulting in a Rise of 6.6 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was erratic and easily stimulated. Major players had different demands. However, due to rumors of India reducing silver import tax and increasing gold export tax, although Indian silver rose, it was still surrounded by buying interest. In the early morning, with the overseas silver market rising in London and stable in the US, the forward silver price in Monte Carlo was unchanged or slightly reduced. Exchange rates rose uniformly. London gold rose four pence, and sentiment was stable. Off-site pre-market trading opened at 43.4 yuan. Yongli, Chunyuan, Yongda, Decheng, and Xie Da Xiang all advanced, rising to 46.7 yuan.

Customs gold unit rose three percent, and the standard gold price was listed at 947.5 yuan. Sentiment was still stable, and buyers took the opportunity to move, and a step-by-step increase was reported, almost approaching the 50 yuan mark. Banks took the opportunity to sell, blocking the rise. The HSBC bank listed the English and American markets as stable, still having some rotation. Later, the banks' selling appetite was sensitive, and they sold off one after another, stimulating selling pressure, and falling step by step, once turning weak. However, buyers maintained at low prices, and the exchange rate was still stable, gradually improving. Banks sold US dollars, and buyers divested somewhat, gradually moving downstream. However, the situation was very mediocre. Predicting the situation of Indian "small two annas," at noon, the supply and demand sides seemed quite balanced, and the banks were also unwilling to excessively sell. The market was stable. Banks mutually traded, the market situation was volatile, and buying interest was relatively strong, making it easy to pull up. Unexpectedly, the first telegram from India reported a rise of twenty-five annas, and selling pressure was enthusiastic for a while, suddenly falling. However, a part of the psychology was based on the fact that no telegram was received for spot goods, and the telegram noted that it needed to be investigated, expressing doubt. Therefore, there was a lot of maintenance after the low, and large households rushed to buy. It was said that India reduced the import tax on silver, but at the same time increased the export tax on gold, and sentiment turned positive, and buying interest was extremely strong, lacking supply, and broke through the 50 yuan mark, rising rapidly, and the situation was very positive. Major players took the opportunity to divest at high prices. The second rise in Indian silver was four annas, and finally gradually retreated to within 50 yuan.

Indian silver reported a large 25 annas, Fuxingyong Xie Da Xiang Wanfeng Hengchangyong Tongyi Yuanheng Qianchangxiang competed to sell, falling to 2 yuan.

The morning supplementary water was 939 yuan, and the afternoon supplementary water was 943 yuan. The price of pure gold was reduced by 3 yuan, to 942.4 yuan. The spot market situation was weak due to the lack of buyers and the tendency for the swap to be expensive. Tianjin goods were cheap, reduced by 1 yuan, while boiled red was increased by 1 yuan. Both lacked transaction swap market conditions were slightly firm, Huixiang paid Hengyu thirty-five at 6 yuan 3 jiao, Richang paid Chunyuan Yong twenty-one, rising to 7 yuan.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Flower: Insufficient Delivery Chips, This Month's Yarn Has the Appearance of Squeezing Short</h3>
<p>The yarn market was flat in the morning and rose at noon, and the situation became increasingly tense. This is because the delivery deadline for this month is approaching, and it was rumored the day before that a certain factory had said that 20 branches of the Earth were delivered. This matter is still under hesitation, and the amount is very small. At the same time as the floating households move to compensate, the amount of yarn stored in the warehouse is decreasing day by day, the people's hearts are excited, and the market price is rising. It is a pity that the spot yarn sales market is sluggish, which is inevitable.</p>

<h3>Large Quantities of Qualified Cotton Delivered, Cotton Market Inevitably Softens</h3>
<p>The cotton market is stable. Overseas cotton industry conditions have softened again. This month's short sellers are delivering goods. The cotton inspection office's review of qualified goods unexpectedly reached 13,000 piculs daily, so the momentum has slightly eased. However, the bulls still show no signs of emerging, and the market is still brewing.</p>
<p>Cotton Prices Rebound in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Before the tender offer, the market opened with American cotton down 3 to 13 points, and Indian cotton still up 0.75 to 1.25 rupees. However, market rumors were rampant, and selling pressure was heavy at the opening. Prices for all months fell by 1.5 to 3 dimes. By the third closing, it was heard that the tender premium had risen, and securities had also increased. A wave of false air dissipated, and as a result, prices for all months fell by 1 to 1.5 dimes. At the afternoon opening, the yarn market suddenly jumped,带动the cotton market upward, but the situation was not as strong as the yarn market. Osaka Sanpin cotton fell by more than one yuan. Ultimately, prices for all months rose by 5 fen to 1.5 dimes compared to the morning closing price. Sales included: Mingde 1,200 piculs, Mei Ji 900 piculs, Dafu 1,200 piculs, Jinchang 1,200 piculs, Tonghe 3,300 piculs, Shenchang 900 piculs, Shenji 1,900 piculs, Yuan Yi 1,200 piculs, Yichang 1,300 piculs, and Xincheng 1,200 piculs.

<h3>Grain: Foreign Wheat Price Drop Sweeps Through Flour and Wheat Markets</h3>
<p>After the flour market opened, near- and far-month contracts fell sharply across the board. The price drop was very severe. The far-month contracts once fell by about 5 cents. This was largely because international conditions eased, foreign wheat was widely reported to be falling, and spot foreign wheat was actively being offered for sale. The market was greatly shaken. New buyers remained on the sidelines, and hoarders sought to unload their holdings. The market followed suit and plummeted. Moreover, several factories were actively selling off their holdings, making it difficult to rally the market in the short term. The near-month contracts were relatively stable due to demand for spot goods from the Northern Gang.</p>
<p>Saturday's Closing Price Yesterday's Closing Price Change</p>
<p>October Series 2.7101 2.6825 Down 0.0275</p>
<p>November Series 2.7425 2.7075 Down 0.0350</p>

<p>March Series 2.8250 2.7800 Down 0.0450</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened, both foreign wheat from the US and Canada fell by 3 to 5 dimes. News of small price drops also came from Liverpool, Australia, and Argentina. If gold prices ease further, there is hope for transactions in spot foreign wheat. Therefore, hoarders both inside and outside the industry are doing their best to liquidate their holdings. In the afternoon, the flour market fell, and the situation became even softer. December and February contracts fell by as much as 9 fen. This month, due to the scarcity of spot wheat, sellers were unwilling to sell further. Therefore, no transactions were made in the afternoon. Spot wheat was affected by the decline in foreign wheat and flour futures, and the factories uniformly resisted purchases, while the owners still wanted to sell at previous asking prices, resulting in no transactions between the two sides.</p>

<h3>River Rice Declines, Sales Remain Sluggish</h3>
<p>(Hu Nan) Yesterday, more than thirty firms were sourcing rice (totaling more than 6,000 piculs). Sales in the market were even more sluggish. The volume of each transaction was small, and the price of both thick-grain and thin-grain rice fell by 1 to 2 dimes. However, the thin-grain rice had a better appearance. Firms from Tianjin, Weihaiwei, Yantai, and Qingdao purchased about 2,000 packages, tightening the situation slightly, with prices rising by an amount less than 1 jiao. Kiln-grown Baige rice was also purchased at 6 to 7 hundred packages at a premium. The market presented a firm appearance. New japonica rice continued to sell well at a premium of several fen to one jiao. Du Yang and other types of new early rice also had difficulty selling, and prices were lowered again. The price of aged rice continued to decline.</p>
<h3>Large Arrival of 客秈 Rice Leads to Sudden Drop of 2-3 Dimes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was a continuous flow of 客秈 rice, with new arrivals including 4,000 to 5,000 packages of rice from Jiangxi's Shashi, Hankou, Ningbo, Jiangyin, and Taizhou. However, local demand for 客胃 rice was not strong, and rice from Shashi and Hankou did not achieve good results. The prices of other rice also depreciated and were sold off. As a result, Gan rice immediately fell by 2 to 3 dimes, and Yong rice also fell by about 1 dime. Digestion improved after the price drop. Tianjin firms purchased nearly 1,000 packages of Ningbo Jiangliu 秈 rice and Hu Bai rice. Local firms purchased 625 packages of Jiangxi rice, more than 700 packages of Wenzhou-Taizhou rice. The inventory of 洋 rice in the market is already scarce, and dealers' intentions are very firm, so the market can still stand firm. Yesterday, local appetite was still good, and owners were mostly unwilling to sell at lower prices, so only 50 packages of 絞 rice were offered. 3,000 packages of 遷邏 broken rice were still traded.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: New Asphalt Already Has Market Demand</h3>
<p>New asphalt is about to arrive. However, since Hubei and other provinces are located thousands of miles away, new oil typically arrives in Shanghai at the end of the eleventh lunar month. Therefore, the local firms and candle makers have relied on the neighboring province of Zhejiang for their supply. The abundance or scarcity of the annual harvest in the asphalt-producing areas of eastern and western Zhejiang is of particular concern to asphalt firms and candle makers in Shanghai. According to reports, this year's harvest in Zhejiang is generally abundant. The fruits borne by the asphalt trees are more plentiful than in previous years, even without increased cultivation efforts, which is unprecedented. However, the presses in the asphalt-producing areas of eastern Zhejiang press both tung oil and asphalt oil. Since the tung oil production season is one month earlier than asphalt oil, and tung oil prices are currently high, the presses are prioritizing the pressing of tung oil. Although the asphalt oil production season has arrived, it will inevitably be pushed back by tung oil. Therefore, the initial supply may not be abundant. However, the Jiaxing area in western Zhejiang, which does not produce tung oil, can be expected to begin pressing on schedule, likely in the first ten days of the eleventh lunar month. It is currently heard that some people from inland areas have come to Shanghai to sell asphalt, with prices totaling 16.40 to 16.50 yuan per picul delivered, which is cheaper than Jing asphalt oil. Therefore, buyers are very enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Most Sugar Prices Unchanged</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trended flat. The Association's closing price for coarse white raw sugar was 18.20 yuan, unchanged. However, re-exported goods fell slightly by 5 fen to close at 6 yuan. Zhenji's locally produced cotton white sugar also maintained a stable trend, holding its original price. The Sugar Industry Cooperative Company tendered 190 packages of cotton red sugar at 13.20 yuan, 80 packages of No. 2 Guangdong cotton white sugar at 17.70 yuan, and 80 packages of No. 4 at 17.50 yuan. The remaining Huizhong raw white sugar and Dutch coarse white sugar were not traded. A Guangdong firm offered more than 100 packages of Zhu Qing sugar at 10 to 9.90 yuan. A Chaozhou firm also asked for a 5-dime increase for Ti Qing sugar, to 12 yuan, but did not succeed. No. 8 Dong White was offered at 18.10 yuan, No. 9 at 17.90 yuan, and Dong Red was offered at 14 yuan, all of which were not traded.</p>

<h3>Natural Description (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Qu Yi</p>
<p>In literary works, natural description has always been regarded as very important. The ancients said, "Mountains and forests are in decline, the mansion of literary thought," which is what this means. But why must there be natural description in literary works? The reason for that has also been said long ago:</p>
<p>"The seasons alternate, yin and yang alternately prevail; the movement of things affects the heart. When the yang energy sprouts, the colt steps forward; when the yin law congeals, the red crow is ashamed. Even the smallest insects are affected, so profound is the influence of the four seasons. When jade emits its brilliance and talents reveal their pure energy, who can remain at peace? Therefore, the beginning of spring brings joy; the torrential summer brings melancholy; the clear air of autumn inspires lofty ambitions; the boundless snow evokes solemn thoughts. Each season has its own characteristics, and each thing has its own appearance. Emotions change with things, and words express those emotions. Even a single leaf can welcome intention, and the sound of an insect can draw the heart. How much more so when the clear wind and bright moon share the night, and the white sun and spring forest share the morning! Therefore, poets are endlessly inspired by things, associating them without end. Wandering among the myriad phenomena, dwelling in the realm of sight and sound, they attempt to depict their appearance, following the objects in their twists and turns. Attaching words to sounds, they also linger with the heart..."</p>
<p>This is to say that people live in nature and are constantly affected by it. Literature is the expression of people's emotions; therefore, natural description is unavoidable. But there are two points worth noting here. The first is the relationship between man and nature. The second is the method of natural description. Throughout history, the attitude of men toward nature and the method of expression have been almost the same.</p>
<p>The relationship between man and nature has probably gone through several stages. Initially, it was one of ignorance and harmony with nature: one of submission to nature. Then, with the invention of drilling for fire and building nests of wood, people learned to utilize nature and overcome it. But since the tools became increasingly advanced, people knew how to further create nature. Originally, human happiness should be built on creating nature. The ultimate purpose of human history is to call people to the goal of struggling with nature. But the literati of the past were all unproductive parasites, so they could not only fail to unleash the power of overcoming nature and creating nature, but they also could not discover such power in themselves—in human abilities. Therefore, the literati became the weakest of all people; Huang Zhongze's poem: "Immortals and Buddhas are both unachieved, only knowing how to lament alone at night; wind-driven sails are full of sad songs, willow catkins bring a bad reputation; nine out of ten people deserve a white eye, a scholar is useless in everything; do not let poems cause worry and recognition, spring birds and autumn insects make their own sounds," can be said to have written about the literati's incompetence. In particular, comparing literati to spring birds and autumn insects is undoubtedly appropriate.</p>
<p>Poets never dare to fight back against the attacks of nature, and they cannot fight back. Therefore, even the sound of curses is not heard. Nature is infinitely great and mysterious in front of poets. Nature is God. Originally, in the era of natural economy, although farmers could utilize nature, partially overcome nature, and change nature, when nature exerted its greatest power (such as storms and droughts), they could only sigh in their homes and do nothing about it. It is not surprising that fetishism exists in peasant society. Qu Yuan's Nine Songs are said to be folk songs used to worship gods in the State of Chu, but they have been passed down after being polished by Qu Yuan. The overall impression of the Nine Songs is all about praising the spirituality and mystery of nature. It has a strong undertone of fetishism. For example, in Mountain Spirit, it says: "There seems to be someone on the mountain, draped in ivy and wearing dodder. She seems to be glaring, then she seems to smile. She admires me for my graceful form. She rides a red leopard, followed by a patterned civet. Her carriage is made of magnolia, and her flag is tied with cinnamon. She lives among rocks and wears sweetgrass. She breaks off fragrant stems and leaves them for her beloved." Also, in Lesser Master of Fate, it says: "Wearing lotus clothes and a belt of sweet herbs, she comes and goes in a flash. She spends the night on the Emperor's plains, who is she waiting for at the edge of the clouds? I will travel with you on the Nine Rivers, where the rushing wind rises and the water waves. I will bathe with you in Xianchi, and dry your hair in the Yang River." Also, in Lady Xiang, it says: "I heard that the beautiful woman is summoning me, and I will ride with her. She builds a house in the water, thatched with lotus leaves. The walls are fragrant with purple sandalwood, and the hall is strewn with fragrant peppers. The pillars are cinnamon and chinaberry, the lintels are magnolia, and the rooms are filled with medicine. She weaves dodder into curtains and spreads sweet herbs. White jade is used as weights, and rocks and orchids are used for fragrance. The house is thatched with sweetgrass and lotus leaves, and surrounded by Northern Hyacinth. All kinds of herbs are planted in the courtyard, and fragrant herbs are built into the gate. The nine melodies are played together, welcoming her arrival like clouds." These are all extreme efforts to sculpt the gods and greatness of nature, and to gather the most beautiful things in the universe to describe the nobility and fragrance of nature's personality. At its root, there is a strong fetishistic thought.</p>
<p>People feel the insignificance of their own abilities in the face of nature. Thus, the idea of worshiping nature arose. As a result of worshiping nature, they want to learn from nature in order to seek its vastness. The Taoist idea of returning to simplicity has its roots here. But the vastness sought by Taoism is only a kind of spiritual victory, not actual vastness. They want to break away from the human world, follow the "laws of nature," and live alone in this nature, existing forever with nature. Whether they can live on or not is a question. But people call these kinds of people gods or immortals. Perhaps some of them cannot live on and quietly starve to death. But some people call them immortals. And some people write poems to praise them and admire them; the poem says:</p>
<p>"The kingfisher plays with the orchid shoots, the colors of the guest and the scene are even more brilliant. Green vines bind the tall forest, covering a mountain in mist. In the midst is a silent hermit, quietly whistling and playing a clear stringed instrument. He releases his emotions beyond the heavens, chewing herbs and drinking from flying springs. Red Pine roams above, riding a swan in purple smoke. He pulls at Floating Hill's sleeve on the left and claps Hongya's shoulder on the right. May I ask you, ephemeral beings, how can you know the years of the tortoise and crane? How can the six dragons be stopped? The flow of fortune changes. When the times interact, people think of home, and autumn is longing for summer. The Huaihai River turns into a tiny bird, but my life alone does not transform. Although I want to surpass Danxi, I cannot ride the clouds and dragons. Ashamed of lacking the virtue of Lu Yang, I turn the sun back to three houses. Facing the river, I grieve for old age, and I touch my heart in solitary sadness." (Guo Han's Poem on Traveling as an Immortal)</p>
<h3>Stream Bathing</h3>
<p>— Yao Mu</p>
<p>I really like water. A small stream, a pool, all evoke an unnamed joy in me, especially when I encounter a gurgling stream or a splashing pool in the mountains. It is as if I were hearing the free-spirited sound of the seven-stringed zither in the silent night, or seeing the faint smile of the twin whirlpools before a solemn goddess. I am particularly fascinated.</p>
<p>I remember that the first time I traveled as a child was to Mount Dinghu, which is famous for its Flying Water Pool. The emerald green pool water, the cascading long waterfalls, and the tall trees brushing against each other still linger in my heart. Like the fluff of first love, I really idealized the secluded interest of mountain springs.</p>
<p>This year, there is a beautiful Yellow Dragon Pool waterfall near our mountain residence. I have been there twice, but unfortunately not after it rained and the springs were flowing. But sitting on a sheep-fat-like stone beach, watching the clear, cold spring flow out from between the chaotic rocks and trees, winding and meandering between the stones and rock holes, the sound of water filled my ears. Dipping my feet into the water and washing my face with water, the heat and fatigue were all dissipated by the ice-cold pleasure. Looking down from the Wan Shou Bridge, I saw a waterfall falling from the top of the mountain, like silver silk and ice chips, cascading for tens of feet and condensing into an ancient jade-like blue pool. The stone walls on both sides were steep, and there were traces of flowing springs. I could imagine the spectacular sight of thousands of valleys flowing after a heavy rain. The walls were covered with green moss, and small trees with vines growing on them, and grasses like orchids and iris. Sprinkled with splashing water flowers, they were fresh and dripping. Several golden daylilies were hidden in the grass and trees, showing off their charm. In addition to the glittering water and springs, there was the fragrance of grass and flowers. Being in it, it felt like sipping a thousand-year-old mellow wine, forgetting both myself and the outside world, and like ascending to a pure land, where not a speck of dust could touch my body or mind.</p>
<p>We also once moved in the mountains. There was a mountain stream a mile away from our new residence, where cold springs gushed out, and chaotic rocks piled up. The scenery was so quiet and secluded that it resembled the scenes in Liu Zongyuan's short essays. When we passed by, we already felt that it was a good place to take a bath. The day after arriving, at noon, I took Lao Zhang and our bathing equipment and clothes to be washed there. After passing a few houses, we followed a small path buried in lush grass, turned a few bends, and heard the tinkling sound of the spring. Following the sound of the water, we walked down a few more steps and saw the mountain stream.</p>
<p>It hadn't rained for a few days after, so the stream was still not small. The rocks varied in size and were scattered in a crisscross pattern. Depending on the shape of the rocks, some places swirled and surged, some places formed small pools, and some places gushed like small waterfalls. Pear trees and some unknown large-leaved trees were planted diagonally on both sides of the stream, their branches and leaves crisscrossing and forming a natural pergola, even shading the stream. The high sun peered through the gaps in the branches and leaves, and round shadows swayed in the pool. Depending on the depth of the water and the brightness of the sunlight, the water presented various colors, such as cyan, light green, light yellow, and snow white, but they were all equally clear, pure and ice-cold.</p>
<p>Two young girls had arrived before us and were squatting by the stream washing clothes. We took off our boots and, with clumsy movements, jumped from one rock to another, from low places to high places, surveying the surroundings of the stream. Then, we washed the clothes we brought in a hurry and hung them on sunny rocks to dry. After the girls left, we chose a deeper and more open place for our bathing place. The water was just over our knees. When we first dipped our feet, we felt a chill all over our bodies, and we were about to shiver. After rubbing for a while, we felt better. Sometimes I lay in the water with my whole body, sometimes I lay on my back and let the flowing spring water wash over me, and sometimes I sat on a rock and splashed water with my feet. Half the time I was bathing, half the time I was playing. I didn't know where the boring feeling of having nothing to do all day had disappeared to!</p>
<p>After bathing in the stream, we chose a boulder like a bed to lie down on and sunbathe. The sunlight suddenly stopped, and the rain followed the cool breeze. The rustling sound of rain hitting the leaves and the gurgling sound of the spring echoed each other. We put on our clothes and hid under the dense leaves. After a while, the rain stopped, and the sun came out again. The mountain stream, after being bathed in rain, was even more green and moist.</p>
<p>I have also taken various kinds of baths. Needless to say, a stuffy steam bath – if you allow me to use a woman as a metaphor – a hot spring bath is like an affectionate wife, a sea bath is like a beautiful and graceful young woman, while a stream bath has the style of "Wearing a green sleeve in the cold, leaning on slender bamboo at sunset." Those who have tried stream bathing will not consider this metaphor an exaggeration, right?</p>
<p>Those few days were when the moon was bright. The mountain stream under the moon must have been very quiet and secluded. I imagined that the night was as cool as water, the rocks were as cool as ice, the trees were crooked and slanting, and the silver light was shimmering. There was a sound of flowing water. The water nymphs and goddesses who are said to bathe in secret in mythology, if they really exist, must also be bathing here at this time! Unfortunately, I was busy for the next three days after the bath, and I didn't step into the moonlight to seek that dreamlike scene. I still regret this even now!</p>
<h3>Two Kinds of Fathers</h3>
<p>— Mo Fu</p>
<p>Balzac, the French writer, has a novel called "Old Goriot." It begins like this: "Old Goriot, a man who had made a fortune, loved his two daughters very much. In order to marry them off in great splendor, he spared no expense in giving them all his possessions. He himself ended up living in poverty in a student boarding house, afraid to visit them for fear of embarrassing them. Later, he became very ill, and only a young man living in the same boarding house took care of him. The young man saw that the old man was getting worse and quickly asked the boarding house servant to notify his two daughters to come and see him; however, the messenger returned alone." Until Old Goriot breathed his last, the young man who was caring for him had personally gone to invite his two daughters, but they never came. On Old Goriot's side, he kept muttering and rambling, "...If I were still a rich man, still holding onto my property, and hadn't given it all to them, they would definitely come, they would frequently kiss my cheeks!...With money, they would be visible...They have hearts of stone...I loved them too much, so they treat me this way. A father should always be a rich old man...Daughters! Arlette, Delphine (the names of his daughters)! I want to see them. Call the police to arrest them...Justice help me! Heaven's law, national law...should all help me...A father trampled under the feet of his children..." These words seemed very clear and rational, but he was still planning how—"to go to Odessa to sell noodles...to earn millions of silver...Let them come, even if it's for the money, I'm willing to be deceived by them..." Finally, he shouted, "Even touching the hem of their clothes would be good...Just want to touch the hem of their clothes...and I would be content...I bless them...bless..." And so he died. Blessing such daughters even at his death, it can truly be said that his love for his daughters reached its extreme.</p>
<p>Perhaps some would think this depiction is a bit excessive, that such daughters could not possibly exist. True, this is indeed not very common, and to some, it may seem cruel. However, if we think about it, things like this seem to be encountered everywhere, and having encountered them, one feels that he hasn't written enough, that they haven't even plotted to murder their father for his property. The world is truly full of children more ruthless than these! Of course, we don't have to respect our parents to the point of unreasonable and absolute obedience, but to ignore them when they have no money, or to secretly plot to murder them for their wealth, is indeed contrary to human nature.</p>
<p>This is a kind of father who dotes on his children, disregarding his own life and death. Fathers like Old Goriot are really not special; most parents dote on their children. What's special is only in these two daughters.</p>
<p>Because of this novel, it reminded me of another kind of father who is completely different from this. Several years ago, I lived in a small city. My landlord was a retired soldier around forty years old. He only had one child. In the past, his family finances were not bad, but because he had nothing to do, he developed a gambling habit, and soon squandered his entire fortune. However, he was not worried about the loss of his property, but worried only when the last residence was sold off, and his wife, four months pregnant, miscarried from the shock. Since then, she had four miscarriages in seven or eight years, unable to hold onto the fetus. He always advocated "one more son, one more happiness," so he naturally wouldn't fail to cherish his only son. However, his method of loving his son was completely different from Old Goriot's—in daily life, he would enjoy better food and clothing himself, leaving his child to watch with longing from the side. He had a reason to defend himself—the child will have plenty of time to eat and wear good things! Not only that, but his family education was frighteningly strict. Even though he was only a few years old, the child had to obey absolutely, just like he treated soldiers, without any reason. As a result, the child was crushed under his heavy pressure. He was listless all day long, always looking like his soul had left his body, almost like a fool. Moreover, his love was different from Old Goriot's—Old Goriot's love was pure, entirely based on blood ties, without any purpose. But this other person was the opposite, with a purpose—hoping to enjoy the happiness bestowed by his son in the future, so he spared no effort in harsh training,鞭撻孩子猛進 (?), hoping to achieve his own purpose, disregarding the child's own welfare. We won't worry about the results for now. This kind of fatherly love that contains other purposes is really more cruel and inappropriate than the two daughters' treatment of Old Goriot. However, such fathers are as common in today's society as Old Goriots, and can be encountered anytime, anywhere.</p>

<h3>Honorable Old Woman (12)</h3>
<p>— Written by Ekuma Shū, Translated by Ren Jun</p>
<p>One late autumn night, a violent knocking suddenly echoed at my door. Unexpectedly, the knocker turned out to be from the police station. It turned out that the old woman had just been found hanging herself in the courtyard of a temple on the edge of the city, and the police were there to notify us.</p>
<p>The people in my house were all shocked. Because on this day, the old woman had still come to my house early in the morning and worked until night before going back.</p>
<p>"Oh, so she really went crazy. Lately, I always felt she was a bit funny... But because the old woman was funny to begin with, I didn't pay much attention..."</p>
<p>My mother said this and began to chant Buddhist scriptures.</p>
<p>The accountant and the male servant ran out. I also quietly followed them, because I wanted to see something scary. It was a dark and cold night. Countless small stars in the sky were twinkling. We relied on the light of the lanterns and hurried towards the dark edge of the city.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the temple, the old woman's body had already been taken down and placed on a mat under the steps of the main hall, covered with another mat.</p>
<p>A policeman and two other people were constantly shining the light of an electric lamp into the darkness, illuminating the lump under the mat.</p>
<p>I was both flustered and scared. Curled up in a ball, hiding behind the accountant. After listening to the people at the scene recounting the discovery, he went to the corpse in silence. Then, he quietly pulled back the mat, and I peeked out from behind him, trembling.</p>
<p>The shocking thing was that the old woman was still wearing that tattered 四 (?), and the 章 (?) on her chest was shining.</p>
<p>I suddenly felt like I heard her crazy voice:</p>
<p>"This is honor! This is honor!" (The End)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt's Son Punished</h3>
<p>— Jia Wei</p>
<p>Every morning, I turn to the first couple of pages of this newspaper, which, as usual, are filled with new information about the Abyssinian question: "Ten thousand Abyssinian troops prepare on the Ogeden line, the East African War is about to begin," "Sixteen thousand Italian troops continue to head to East Africa," "League of Nations sanctions are not relaxed," "Britain replies to the French government, the Mediterranean fleet is difficult to withdraw," "Britain may blockade the Italian coast..." Thinking of those Italian troops, who are known as "civilized people," and of their leader Mussolini—the second Lincoln, he prides himself?—wanting to "conquer" those Abyssinians, who are regarded as "barbarians," and innocent women and children, so bravely" using gas and dumdum bullets to carry out massacres, in the reader's feeling, even the spaces between the words on the newspaper page seemed filled with the atmosphere of gunpowder, poison gas, and blood.</p>
<p>However, in another corner of today's newspaper, on the other side of these bloody messages, we also read a record of "yellow journalism." The content is copied as follows:</p>
<p>"President Roosevelt's son was fined five dollars today by Judge Pancost for speeding. Roosevelt's son is currently a junior at Harvard University. On September 18, he was driving at 65 miles per hour" (National News Agency Dispatch on September 18).</p>
<p>"Speeding, a fine of five dollars," this was originally a commonplace thing, but the news agency had to make a special dispatch for it; and the newspaper editor added "flair" to it and published it to attract attention. Of course, this is because the person involved is the son of the current US President Roosevelt, right?</p>
<p>Originally, as the author himself, there is no need to create a personal biography for him. However, putting aside those gunpowder-filled news items that I read every day and thinking quietly, I feel that there are a few words to say.</p>
<p>The law, originally, is the "superstructure of society." It is the norm of every society, that is, the standard for individual behavior, regardless of status or class. It is precisely "honesty above and below, treating everyone equally." However, precisely because all the superstructures of society have to change with the changes in the economic base of society, the law cannot be an exception. But throughout history, society has been an unequal society. In this way, the law has become a tool used by the rulers to oppress the lower masses, which has become an undisguisable fact.</p>
<p>Therefore, Roosevelt's son breaking the law and being fined is such an ordinary little thing, and it has to be telegraphed and published in newspapers around the world. Apart from its exaggeration and propaganda components, under certain conditions, it is worthy of people's attention. Especially today, under the state of social psychology in our society, which only cares about power and profit.</p>
<p>However, to say it again, we think that it is not enough to rely solely on this to maintain the dignity of existing laws and to demonstrate the equality of society. You must know that under certain circumstances, the rulers are using this method to whitewash their true faces. Therefore, if we want society to be peaceful and bright, and if we want the law to be equal, then we must first equalize the social foundation on which our laws and other superstructures depend!</p>

<h3>Book Strap</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>The dismissal bell rang for the third class. Liu Fugao winked at his companions. As the class monitor, he stood up and shouted loudly, "One, two, three." After the teacher stepped out of the classroom with his books, the classroom became chaotic, like a beehive that had been overturned. Everyone called out to their close friends, arranging to walk together, or to go somewhere else to play. Wrapping books, knocking on desks, throwing rubber balls, everything was making noise. Naturally, there were also a few refined fellows who had a beautiful book strap; this strap had caused envy in the classroom. With a stack of books, they would buckle it this way and that, and then carry it steadily in their hands. When walking, holding the end of the strap, the stack of books would sway back and forth, and with the sound of their little leather shoes, the appearance was pretty enough. But buckling this strap takes a little time, and the knot must be buckled in the very center of the stack of books, otherwise, when walking, it will bump against their knees. Liu Fugao was the class monitor, and the school awarded him a strap. He naturally happily went home to boast in front of his parents, and he could sway back and forth in front of his classmates. His closest friend and classmate, Wang Yuande, didn't have one, and he was very envious of Liu Fugao's book strap. For several days after school, he slipped away alone. Liu Fugao knew this, and he comforted him, saying that the school was biased, and that Wang Yuande's studies were also very good, his essays were always above 80 points, and he should also be awarded a book strap. But empty words didn't make Wang Yuande happy. When the two of them walked home together, he seemed not to want to be seen, walking close to the wall. For the last three days, Liu Fugao couldn't find Wang Yuande when school ended. The class monitor understood in his heart that he didn't bring his book strap to sway around today. He pulled Wang Yuande and said, "Today we'll still walk together, I won't use the book strap?" And there's something good to see today.</p>
<p>So after Liu Fugao winked, Wang Yuande deliberately stacked and re-stacked his few thin books, tidied them up again and again, and slowly unfolded the newspaper, wrapping the books as if he were folding handicrafts. The other classmates all hopped and skipped away. A few refined fellows carefully buckled the book straps in the center, swaying and swaying out of the classroom. The two of them stuck out their tongues and, as in the past, held hands affectionately, going out of the school's back door. The school's back door was a real alley, and you had to walk another block to get around to the front door. But they often walked this way, they wanted to walk slowly, avoiding the eyes of their classmates, to go to a good place to see good things. It's not that Liu Fugao didn't want everyone to follow him to see it, because this thing was good to see, but it wasn't enough to speak out loud. He himself was the class monitor, and the class monitor couldn't be so sloppy and do the wrong thing. Wang Yuande was a good friend, so naturally he was an exception.</p>
<p>From the school's front door, crossing two more streets, there was a small movie theater. When they got out of school, it was just about time for the second show at 5:30 to begin. At the entrance, there was a square box playing nice-sounding songs. There were some that Liu Fugao and Wang Yuande could also sing, like "The Road," "Graduation Song," which were all taught at school. But the sound coming from that box was loud, as if many people were singing together. Near the door was a glass cabinet, which displayed still photos from the film. If they were just looking at this, they wouldn't have to be so secretive, because they were thinking about the movie that was playing inside. They came up with a method: secretly hiding by the door, and when three or five adults bought tickets to go in, they would immediately go in with them. The rule of this small movie theater was that every adult could bring one child. They had seen many movies using this method, but this method could not be known to their classmates. Liu Fugao was the class monitor!</p>
<p>Yesterday he didn't walk the same way with Wang Yuande again. He felt that this book strap had caused him to lose a good friend. He didn't know why, but he walked to the movie theater again. He saw that there were quite a few still photos in the glass cabinet, singles, doubles, photos of foreign women dancing. Liu Fugao originally wanted to use the old method to go in and take a look, but he wasn't very happy without Wang Yuande. He didn't bring the book strap today, to pull Wang Yuande to see the dancing.</p>
<p>But when they squeezed in behind three or five adults, they were stopped by the ticket taker, who said that children were not allowed. 一一鬧蹩扭, the people in front had already disappeared. They didn't understand the meaning of "children not allowed." The two of them discussed that the reason for being rejected was: this is foreign women dancing, you need to buy a ticket for each person, no children allowed. Then, they had to think of another method. Wang Yuande's idea was to save up their snack money for a few days. The class monitor seemed even smarter, he said to sell the book strap for money to watch the movie. In order to please his friend, he was willing to give up that swaying, pretty appearance. Wang Yuande was naturally even happier. They stood by the glass cabinet reluctantly, until the square box stopped singing, and then they walked along the way, thinking about the method of exchanging the book strap for money.</p>
<h3>Scenery of Bali</h3>
<p>— Cong Long</p>
<p>This Bali, known as the "Greece of the Tropics," certainly has many places worth remembering, praising, and lingering in.</p>
<p>Except for the high mountains in the west, the rest is a fertile plain suitable for planting. Even the high mountains, the grandeur and majesty of the caves, the solemnity and tranquility of the volcanic crater area, and the swirling and slowly moving clouds and mist at dawn and dusk, floating like jade belts among the sharp peaks, all these beautiful scenery can make people feel happy and broad-minded.</p>
<p>Bali's fertile land and the accessibility of its rivers, which are convenient for irrigation, mean that the rice fields are absolutely unaffected by disasters. Moreover, their planting is not limited by the seasons, and they can harvest and sow at any time. Whenever the weather is clear, walking in the suburbs, you can see many dark-skinned natives dotted in a vast expanse of paddy fields: some are busy transplanting rice seedlings, some are driving white buffaloes to plow the soil, and some are harvesting golden rice ears, all happily doing various tasks at different stages at the same time. Because of the mild climate, the fertility of the land, and the ease of planting, the economic situation of most Balinese people is prosperous.</p>
<p>Balinese women all completely expose their upper bodies, letting their pointed, towering breasts, like newly raised graves, tremble slightly with their steps. This is the case all year round, whether indoors or on the street. Men like to put red and white flowers in their hair. It is said that these are their customs, which have been popular from ancient times to the present. Whenever they bathe in the morning and evening, they all take a bath together in the river, men and women alike, completely naked, but it is rare to hear of irregular or lewd romantic behavior between the sexes. This group of beautiful human models in the clear water may make those who come here for the first time feel a little shy and disapproving.</p>
<p>They don't pay much attention to their houses, letting them be broken and rotten, dirty and narrow. They are in danger of collapsing in the face of storms, but they don't care and don't want to repair them, as if these are all small things that are not worth putting on their minds? They would rather spend a surprising amount of money on cockfights or temple fairs to worship the gods. Therefore, to see a complete and magnificent residence here (naturally referring to the general commoner class) is simply as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns.</p>
<p>The Balinese all believe in religion, and worshiping the gods can be said to be one of their important daily tasks. They believe that everything on earth belongs to and is ruled by the gods, and that the gods can give people all happiness and good fortune. Therefore, in Bali, whether on high mountains, beaches, embankments, forests, villages, or outside every family's thatched hut and the palace, there are temples of all sizes. The only task of their梭巴 (village chief) is to build temples for the gods. Therefore, they compete with each other to improve the construction of the temples. Just looking at the carvings on the outer walls of the temple arches, the greatness of the project, and the excellence of the art, one cannot despise the Balinese.</p>
<p>Living in Bali, you can hear the sound of a low, deep bronze drum faintly wafting in the breeze every day, which is them holding a temple fair. When a temple fair is held, groups of women, wearing light and fluttering silk outer garments and adorned with gold and silver jewelry, walk in an orderly manner, row after row, snaking towards the temple, with all kinds of offerings on their heads, looking from a distance like a row of ornate carved Buddha statues in the Thousand Buddha Caves.</p>
<p>The Balinese are also good at dancing. Their dances often depict strange stories. The dancers wear golden helmets, carry daggers, and wear bright golden leaf outer garments. When dancing excitedly, these young dancing girls often draw out the daggers from their sides and cut open their chests, letting the bright red blood flow out and die. This is the same as when a plague occurs in the area, children dance around the hideous death god in front of the temple, and pierce their chests with the snake-shaped daggers in their hands. They believe that all happiness is given by the gods, and that dedicating oneself to the gods is a pure and noble thing!</p>
<h3>Old Books</h3>
<p>— Laborious Mind</p>
<p>When I am unbearably bored, I now like to settle myself in some quiet corner. Therefore, the old book stalls lined along the roadside have become my usual haunt. But one day, I discovered a miracle. Among a pile of old books, I saw two that caught my eye. I picked them up and looked at them closely—there was no mistake! It wasn’t my eyes deceiving me. These were the books of a friend who had fallen on hard times. I distinctly remembered a few jokingly scribbled words I had added to the copyright page, and a newspaper clipping tucked between pages one hundred and twenty-three. Nothing was wrong, everything was as it used to be, although the book had passed through countless hands. This book reminded me of life four months ago, when we were still chatting and laughing, still indulging in youthful games, happily enduring that series of painful and difficult days. At that time, no one would have imagined that things would turn out this way, especially me, becoming lonely and isolated in this vast city, enduring life's challenges without laughter. Thinking of this, I became even more attached to this old book.</p>
<p>"Boss, how much for this one?"</p>
<p>Although I knew very well that I didn't have a single copper coin in my pocket, I never gave up on the slightest glimmer of hope, because I knew this stall owner recognized me. Maybe I could ask him to hold it for me and come back to buy it in a few days. That's why I dared to inquire about the price.</p>
<p>"To be honest, we never exaggerate prices. If you want to buy it, it's eight dimes."</p>
<p>He replied in a tone that also seemed hopeful, because I knew there were times when his stall had virtually no business. After a moment, he added:</p>
<p>"And there are a few more here, all acquired together."</p>
<p>Then he flipped out five or six more. I recognized all five or six of these old books, and two of them were actually my own books that had ended up in his possession. Looking at these books, it was like seeing old friends, and I gazed at them affectionately. Although I was a little resentful that my friend had unfeelingly sold the books he had cherished for so many years, when I thought about his situation, I understood. He was so poor when he left this place, and if he hadn't sold these books, he would have been unable to survive. At the same time, I was willing to forgive him for not giving these books to his friends, because he no longer had that right. Nor could he borrow any money or receive any help from friends. Like me, I was the one who felt most sorry. I had promised him help, but I became a bounced check. I was also suffocating under the pressure of life. In the long period of being unemployed for half a year, I had tasted all of life's "enjoyments"...</p>
<p>"Want to buy?"</p>
<p>The owner, seeing me standing there lingering, looked at me strangely and impatiently.</p>
<p>"Ah, yes. I want to buy, but I really can't afford it today. Could you hold them for me? I'll come back to buy them as soon as I find the money, at most in a day or two."</p>
<p>I pleaded earnestly, and he grudgingly agreed.</p>
<p>But where could I find the money? When I hadn't even secured the rent, where could I find extra money to buy these books? So, I had no choice but to let the days pass one by one. Although my heart was anxiously empty, there was nothing I could do. Until one day, I borrowed a dollar, which was originally meant for food for the next few days, but I forgot everything and ran to the old book stall.</p>
<p>"Boss, the books?"</p>
<p>He gave an apologetic smile: "You haven't been here for more than a week. I thought you had forgotten about them, so I sold them all. Only this one is left."</p>
<p>This one was "A Woman and Society." I bought it at the lowest possible price. As I ate a bowl of plain noodles with the last of my money, I flipped through the book and smiled.</p>

<p>Yulan is audacious and ruthless, unaware of treacherous schemes and major issues. After scaring Wang Tinggui to death, she escapes the net and flies away.

<p>Opening "Yang Guifei's Birthday"</p>
<p>The sixth day of the sixth lunar month is hot. Songs and music are playing steadily in the Tang palace. Yang Guifei, especially favored in the Western Garden, feels resentment and self-pity. One misstep leads to eternal regret, foolish thoughts and infatuation entering the emotional demon. An Lushan's troops revolt in Fanyang, the road to Tongguan is not far. I fear, one general succeeds while ten thousand bones wither. The smoke of war rises, and the good people cry. How can we bear to be homeless and displaced? After thinking it over, I am finally a slave. I have no intention of going to the Hall of Eternal Life again, afraid of playing the pipa and the Dingchi harmony. I am afraid of entering the Huaqing Pool for a bath, afraid of scalding my tender skin. I have no intention of being a lotus flower growing on the same stem. It is better to sit by the window and teach the parrot. It is pleasing that the bird is more intelligent than the palace maids. First teach him three chapters of Qingping Tunes, then teach him the Great Compassion Mantra and recite Amitabha. Listen to him, the warbling sounds like a slave. Time passes quickly, making people old. May the heavens end the war soon. Guifei sighed lightly, her heart was in a mess. The emperor smiled and called out, "Ah Huan." Guifei is frightened. The birthday is on the first day of the sixth month, and the lychees are fresh and plentiful. The south sea offers tribute to the capital. The emperor and his ministers celebrate longevity in the Hall of Eternal Life. A small banquet is arranged for their enjoyment. May the loving couple live a loving life forever.</p>
<p>Xing Ruiting's Hairpin Phoenix</p>
<p>Huiling (1380) 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM</p>
<p>Opening "The Palace of Eternal Life"</p>
<p>In the Kaiyuan era, there was great peace, and orders were given to burn jewels and treasures. Song Zhang and Han were chosen to assist in governance, supporting the throne and aiding in the management of the country. One day, Emperor Tang was tired of eating and sleeping, and his dragon face was not happy after court. He summoned the court eunuch Gao Lishi, asking who was the beauty who could overturn a country. Since Taizhen was favored in the palace, a hairpin box was bestowed as a token of love. She received the king's new rain and dew, and bathed in the warm sun in spring. I see that she is exquisitely dressed, but her eyebrows do not let others. Sisters received favor and all were noble, riding horses to the palace gate in the morning. At Qujiang, they competed for bathing, and the lost jewels were not worth mentioning. At this time, the begonia was still not fully rested, and the hibiscus curtain was warm with fragrance. The beauties of the six palaces had no color, abandoning the beauties Jiang Caiping. Although ten bushels of pearls were personally bestowed, the door was deserted at night. Unexpectedly, Taizhen offended the king's anger, and the dedication of hair still touched the dragon's grace. Have you not heard that a rider brings fresh lychees from afar, but the common people are not as good as the beauty's heart. Just at the night of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl stars, they make oaths of life after life. Who knows that joy had not yet deepened when sorrow arrived. In a moment, the war drums of Yuyang stirred sorrow. It was all because of Lushan's rebellion, the disaster started from within the walls. Because there had been peace in the world for a long time, and the threat of war had been quelled, there were few ministers. What could be done? The king fled west, running for a long journey. Alas, a piece of light silk was tragic and ill-fated, and her fragrant soul fell under Mawei Slope. Fortunately, the smoke of war was extinguished and the royal carriage returned to the capital. I only see that the white-haired concubines are old, and half of the Pear Garden disciples have withered. Sad past events are looked back on in vain, death is far away and cannot be reborn. The sound of the bell in Jiange is about to break the soul, competing to see the silk stockings in the winery village. Later, I wanted to teach the sorcerers to seek them out, but the palace of Penglai was not real. What is the reason that the king is lost in a dream? The emotional sky and the sea of ​​hatred are unreal. If someone sings "Palace of Eternal Life", it will not be listened to as a normal song. Could it be that the rise and fall of governance is a reflection of the past and present?</p>

<p>The 6th National Games has ended. Now, let me record some random notes from the 6th National Games.</p>
<p>The Lianhua Company had a Lianhua Pavilion next to the venue. The Mingxing Company had a "Mingxing Singing Night." The Yihua Company, called some children wearing red and green uniforms, holding shields, and dressed as "Heroes of the Times", and also distributed a signed commemorative booklet.</p>
<p>Dian Tong advertised in the conference special issue, using it as a half-price coupon; Tianyi Fu Baolu's "Guo Zheng" did some voluntary advertising for them.</p>
<p>During the eleven-day conference, the number of stars who arrived was not as ideal as expected. The most frequent visitor was the Liang sisters, who appeared on the podium almost every day in the last few days. The next most frequent visitor was "Sports Queen" Li Lili, who came with Zhu Wenji and was surrounded by fans and star fans who wanted to sign autographs.</p>
<p>Chen Gongjia Zhen was busy taking photos of the athletes at the venue.</p>
<p>Ms. Diao came with Koenig one day, wearing a purple velvet cheongsam, which attracted much attention. I don't know what Jia Gong thought of it.</p>

<h3>New Trends in the Drama and Film Industry Shanghai Drama and Film Research Institute Established</h3>
<p>Lu Shi, director of the Shanghai Art Drama Society, has been working in the film industry since the Dadao Drama Society disappeared. Recently, he and some old friends such as Zheng Boqi, Shen Xiling, Zuo Ming, Tao Jingsun, Ouyang Yuqian, Xiang Peiliang, etc., more than 20 people, seeing the lack of new talent in Chinese drama and film, began to prepare a mechanism to train such specialized talent in the Gongyuanfang in the so-called literary village on Jiangwan Road a month ago. At present, the need for talent in Chinese drama and film is very urgent. Mr. Lu and others were able to recognize this point and fulfill their so-called predecessors' mission to teach and nurture a group of newcomers. This request is worthy of our admiration. Now that the Research Institute has opened, we hope that their efforts will make it a perfect school and make some new contributions to Chinese drama and film.</p>

<h3>A Brief Discussion on Ancient Chinese Architecture (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Shi Dong</p>
<p>The development of Chinese architecture has a very long history. In this long process of development, the building materials used by the architectural community are mostly brick (甎), wood, stone, and mud. Among them, brick has long been widely used in various parts of China. According to various documents, the use of brick as a building material dates back to before the Zhou Dynasty; and its initial use was most prevalent in various parts of the Yellow River Basin. As for wood, it was mostly used in the Yangtze River Basin and southern regions. At that time, there were also buildings in various parts of the Yellow River Basin that mixed brick and wood. For example, the widespread distribution of houses mixing brick and wood in various parts of China can be cited as one of the examples. Stone was also used as a building material at that time, just like brick and wood. And the use of mud as a building material was most common in the northern parts of China in the past. Since the northern regions lacked wood and had little rainfall, mud was the most suitable material for the construction of houses. At this point, the Chinese architectural method was determined by the use of building materials; however, later, as a result of the development of the use of stone and brick, the structure of arches also developed very early, and the frame structure of domes also emerged one after another. Conversely, in this long period, pure wooden houses were not very developed. The architectural method in China since ancient times has focused entirely on the design and decoration of details, that is, focusing exclusively on the external appearance, so the construction of wooden houses was also affected and not very developed.</p>
<p>As for the front of Chinese buildings, the composition method that is uniformly symmetrical front and back, left and right, is usually adopted. For example, from palaces to temples, residences, and tombs, all adopt the composition method that is uniformly symmetrical front and back, left and right. This structural method can be said to be a congenital quirk of the Chinese people; and this idea is not only expressed in the building aspect, such as the arrangement method of stools in the room, and the love of couplets in articles, it can be said that this is the expression of this idea. Also, what is the characteristic of the appearance of ancient Chinese buildings? Its characteristics lie in the use of gorgeous colors, rich detailed designs, and special roofs. At the same time, painting colors on the exterior of buildings is also a characteristic of the Chinese people. For example, painting colors on wood, or using glazed tiles as the exterior of the wall are all examples. From this point, it can be known that color and Chinese buildings are indeed inseparable. However, there has always been a regulation on the use of colors since ancient times; that is, according to the theory of yin and yang and the five elements, the five colors of blue, red, white, yellow, and black are used, because these five colors are symbols of auspiciousness, and later, many very strong and stimulating colors were formulated based on these simple five colors. Also, the richness of the detailed design in Chinese buildings is truly the first in the world. Taking the shape of the window as an example, there are not only square, round, oval, and polygonal shapes; in addition, there are also pot-shaped, flat, arc-shaped, and grid-shaped shapes. And the changes in the window lattices are even more complex, with swastika series, polygonal series, ice-character series, text series, and carving series; it is not uncommon for the window lattice forms of buildings in a city to reach hundreds of kinds. As for the form of the roof, there are also fish-hanging shapes, column base shapes, tree-arch shapes, etc. The precision of its detailed craftsmanship is truly enough to amaze people. Furthermore, in terms of the form of the roof, the Chinese architectural method, for the external characteristics, that is, the structure of the roof, must be concave in principle. This roof shape is not common in the north, but most of the buildings in the south belong to this shape. The reason why the construction methods in the north and south differ from each other is also due to the different characteristics of the north and south ethnic groups. Furthermore, this is also enough to glimpse that paying attention to the special beauty of the appearance is also one of the elements of Chinese buildings.</p>
<h3>Observing Some New Rules of the City's Stadium</h3>
<p>— Ouyang Gu</p>
<p>Whether it's a venue for public gatherings or a sports stadium, both are important lifelines for training people to maintain order and to build physical fitness. Therefore, in Europe and America, such as Los Angeles in the United States and Versailles in France, great sports stadiums are built in the suburbs. However, the designs of such buildings are based on the principles of being grand, beautiful, and safe, as well as economical and practical. Thus, its position has become a special architectural art, which is very different from ordinary construction methods. Fortunately, the National Games, which caused a sensation throughout the country, has already concluded. This great building—the stadium—rarely seen in the city, provides us with a detailed observation. In this indelible great building, we can find the new rules about architecture that we need, many of which are indeed not commonly seen. The following brief notes, though less than one-tenth or one-twentieth, are small in words but show great meaning. The rest remains to be discovered, because the design of these new rules are all handled and supervised by Chinese people, without any foreign involvement. If it is promoted and applied in the future, who can say that it is not a good phenomenon in the Chinese architectural field!</p>
<p>Regarding the prevention of thermal expansion and contraction of cement pilasters, scientific and physical methods are applied as much as possible. At each cement section of the bleachers, a five-fen-or-so expansion joint is left between the adjacent sections to accommodate the expansion and contraction caused by external temperature changes. The cement and trass composition of these cement pilasters cannot be neglected, as they form the foundation of the bleachers. Therefore, the mixing ratio is based on a volume ratio of 1:2:4. The internal steel bars are also specified to have a tensile strength of 1,250 kilograms per square centimeter. Furthermore, one thing that can be used as a general reference is that, according to insiders, the method of inspecting the steel frame structure during construction was particularly novel, that is, no matter what kind of steel material is specified, the maximum tensile strength per square centimeter must not be less than 4,200 kilograms. When assembling, first refer to the roof plan, carefully note the size, and only after checking that there are no errors can the steel be cut and punched. All rivets are also tightly fastened. The method of inspection is to strike each one with a small hammer. Those that are tight will produce a crisp sound, while those that are loose will produce a broken, dull sound.</p>
<p>The lighting in the exercise hall and gym is purely high-angle. The periphery of the domed roof is fitted with frosted glass wire skylights, which can eliminate all dazzling bright light. Moreover, the gym floor is padded with oil felt, lined with pine tongue-and-groove boards, and covered with械木Marle, eliminating any possibility of radiant light and completely insulating against underground moisture, which can be considered very perfect. Furthermore, when the National Games began, the swimming competition was scheduled in the evening. The lighting equipment in the swimming pool was even more amazing. The lights were installed below the horizontal plane of the pool wall. During the competition, the lights and the water color were very harmonious. Presumably, when building, on the one hand, the installation of the glass cover of the pool wall was completely impermeable to water, and on the other hand, it was necessary to prevent leakage from the cement bends and joints. Unexpectedly, when applied today, it has such achievements. This can also be seen as a new path for the development of Chinese technology.</p>
<p>The podium and VIP reception area set up in the main hall of the venue have a steel frame canopy built above them, extending horizontally in the air. The excellence and strangeness of the design is rare even in the entire city of Shanghai. This cantilevered steel frame is about thirteen feet long, covered with a glass canopy, and suspended in the air on three sides without any support bars. It is indeed a strange design of the latest type. The current National Games opened for a total of ten days. At least one million people from China and abroad arrived to visit. Therefore, great efforts were also made for the external aesthetics of the stadium. We first observed the entire venue's building, and we did not find a single chimney. During construction, efforts were made to make the setting of chimneys elegant, so they were all hidden above the roof of the giant Ding-shaped gate tower. The towers still stand tall, so at first glance, who would think that they are the chimney pipes for setting up stoves! The red brick clear water walls, cement pillars, and large materials on the remaining four sides are all placed inside the wall and hidden from view, which is very neat and beautiful, and seems to be in line with the neat conditions of architecture.</p>
<p>Regarding the construction and construction situation and process of the remaining parts, this magazine's Double Ten Festival special issue on architecture has already said in great detail, so I don't want to go into too much detail here. We will now look at such a vast and great building. According to the value of the work and material cost report disclosed by the project management office there, the amount is also very low, because the materials used are mostly domestic products. Also, after looking at the table below, you will know its exact number:</p>
<p>Building construction 995,300</p>
<p>Sanitary equipment 69,000</p>
<p>Electrical equipment 17,300</p>
<p>Swimming pool water supply equipment 34,500</p>
<p>Ditches 7,800</p>
<p>Running track 6,700</p>
<p>Ball field 1,400</p>
<p>Lead wire steel 8,000</p>
<p>Cement road 7,000</p>
<p>Backfilling engineering 15,000</p>
<p>Wooden bleachers 6,000</p>
<p>Total 1,168,100 yuan</p>
<p>In addition, all engineering design and supervision matters of the stadium are planned and cooperated by various agencies in the city, without any foreign involvement. For all architectural materials, domestic products are used as much as possible, which shows that the authorities are sincerely promoting domestic products in the midst of efforts to build. This is worthy of emulation by the architectural community.</p>
<h3>Swedish Public Housing Architecture</h3>
<p>— Bu Ren</p>
<p>The Swedish public housing construction movement began in 1916, and the main organizer was the Stockholm Housing Cooperative. This cooperative was founded by the General Federation of Labor; the members of the cooperative are the future residents, and they are mostly low-income class. They have the opportunity to participate in the construction and management of the houses that serve as their residences. By 1922, the cooperative's plan had been largely realized, and it further engaged in a nationwide movement.</p>
<p>Under this movement, a group called "Savings Building Society" (Hyresgasternas SparkasseochByggnadsforening—referred to as H.B.S.) began to be established. The amazing achievements of public housing construction currently seen in Swedish cities must be attributed to this H.B.S and its chief architect, Sven Wallander.</p>
<p>The Savings Building Society, headquartered in Stockholm, is a rather complex organization. It buys land, or leases land for a long term. After the houses are built, the headquarters sells them to various residential branch offices. The headquarters records accounts, manages finances, sells houses, and purchases fuel and other supplies for branch offices. The entire organization is managed by a trust committee, whose members are publicly elected by representatives of the branch offices and re-elected annually.</p>
<p>Residents, i.e., those who buy houses, are members of the Savings Building Society. When a member joins the society, they should purchase one share, which costs 15 yuan, with an annual interest rate of 6%, and pay 10% to 15% of the house price. The remaining shortfall is paid by the headquarters, and this expense is mostly borrowed from the National Savings Bank and insurance companies.</p>
<p>Houses are divided into three types: A, B, and C. Therefore, members are also divided into three types: A, B, and C. The price of type A houses ranges from 2,000 yuan to more than 10,000 yuan, and the annual rent ranges from 150 yuan to more than 800 yuan. The price of type B houses ranges from 400 yuan to 2,000 yuan, and the annual rent ranges from 120 yuan to 500 yuan. Type C members do not pay the house price when joining the society, but only need to pay the rent annually.</p>
<p>Taking a type B member paying 200 yuan per year as an example, the use of the annual rent is as follows:</p>
<p>Loan interest... 120.00 yuan</p>
<p>Loan amortization... 35.00 yuan</p>
<p>Supply... 21.00 yuan</p>
<p>Heating and hot water... 16.00 yuan</p>
<p>Repair... 6.50 yuan</p>
<p>Reserve... 1.50 yuan</p>
<p>Total 200.00 yuan</p>
<p>After twenty years, the loan will be fully paid off, and the house will belong to the resident. However, the resident must still pay a considerable rent each year to cover repairs, supplies, and other expenses. Residents who have obtained ownership of the house can sell or rent the house, but must seek the consent of H·S·B·.</p>
<h3>Architectural Jargon (19)</h3>
<p>— Mei Zhenhuan</p>
<p>— Regarding use in the construction site —</p>
<p>Full Foot (滿脚)—If it is not in accordance with another term in the construction site, then the meaning of Full Foot (Fill Mud) is to fill the mud, because the progress of the work in the construction site takes a certain step, and Full Foot is after setting up the large footing (Footing) (note that setting up the large footing is also one of the jargons,) to speak further, Full Foot is the abbreviation of Filling the footing.</p>
<p>Turning Arrangement (翻排)—When bricklayers are building a wall, when their hands can't reach the height of the wall, they have to put up scaffolding (note that putting up scaffolding is also one of the jargons.) Scaffolding is divided into wood and bamboo. Wooden scaffolding can only be used for buildings with five or six floors. For ordinary two- or three-story houses, it is more common to use bamboo scaffolding, because the materials used for wooden scaffolding are complicated, such as rushing to the sky, top support, foot immersion, and air carrying, and the labor is also much more wasteful, so it is more economically cost-effective to use bamboo scaffolding. Now, when it comes to turning arrangement, what does it mean? That is when bricklayers are building a wall, when their hands can't reach the height of the wall, from the ground, they can only call it putting up scaffolding, but upwards they can't call it putting up scaffolding, they can only call it turning arrangement, which means turning the scaffolding board up one row.</p>
<p>Catching Sample (捉樣)—Regardless of the size of the project, in the organization of personnel, in addition to the supervisor, there is also the sample maker. Concerned, waiting to rule the lower-level doers, the sample maker (detailed before)'s job, as the name suggests, of course puts his mind on the drawings (called the blue sample in the construction site.) The meaning of catching sample is that the sample maker enlarges the dimensions on the blue sample, but in the construction site it is not called enlarging the sample but catching sample.</p>
<p>Blue Sample (藍樣子)—The blue sample itself is not blue, it only turns blue after a scientific action, in addition to the blue sample having its place in the construction site, there is also a consultation sample, that is, the sample approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council or the Public Works Bureau in the concession.</p>
