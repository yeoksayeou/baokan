<h3 id="c20">美國之中立法案 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— 恒</p>
<p>美國之中立法案。已在參衆兩院分別通過。送交羅斯福簽字。立法手續。不久即將完備。按此案初在參院提出時。原為對於交戰國家禁止輸出軍火。同時禁止美人搭乘交戰國之船隻。不許交戰國之軍艦駛入美國港口。故其性質無異於絕對的中立。對交戰國之雙方。一無偏袒於其間。唯此案移交衆院時。衆院予以修正。卽禁止輸出軍火。究對一方為之。抑對雙方為之。由總統當機定奪。聞羅斯福之意。本以禁止軍火輸出。應對侵略國為之。而不應對侵略者與被侵略者。均等待遇。衆院此次修正。足予羅斯福以滿意。可不待言。同時此一中立案。對於中立之期限。亦復予以規定。卽以一九三六年二月二十九日為極限。過此卽屬無效。故此一修正案雖與前在參院提出者似大同小異。然其關係甚鉅。蓋前者之中立。乃大戰前之所謂中立。而後者之中立。則性質上不同於前矣。</p>
<p>按大戰以前。凡屬局外中立之國家。對於交戰國家。勢須以不偏不倚之中正態度。對交戰雙方為平等之待遇。絕不能輕重軒輊於其間。故旣不容援助甲方。亦不許虧損乙方。例如禁運軍火。則必須雙方一律禁止。此種不偏不倚之態度。其基礎卽立於侵略國與被侵略界限不明之觀念上。質言之。國與國間之是是非非。其時莫不由各國自為判斷。不容他人越爼庖代。故一至國際糾紛不能由外交途徑解决時。雙方卽訴諸戰爭之手段。而處於局外者。亦視為公有公理。婆有婆理。除當事者自謀解决外。毌庸臧否是非於其間。更不必認某某爲侵略國。某某為被侵略國。故不中立則巳。一言中立。則卽須兩無所助。且須兩無所損。此次美參院最初通過之中立案。其性質卽屬此類。然大戰以來。一以國聯之成立。二以美國非戰公約之簽訂。此種不偏不倚之中立觀念。是否更有維護之必要。實已成為一大問題。蓋國聯會章對於破壞會章之國家。明明有制裁之規定。是確認兩交戰國有是非曲直之區別。又確認是者直者應扶助之。而非者曲者。應懲戒之。不容任何國家採取過去之局外中立態度也。美國雖非會員國。然非戰公約固曾約東簽字國家放棄以武力為遂行國家政策之工具。換言之。若有一國而違約仍以武力為遂行國策之工具渚。卽爲黷武國。彰彰甚明。此約對於黷武國家之制裁。雖無明文規定。然至少不應與不黷武而僅僅自衛之國家相提並論。同等待遇。則固無人得而否認之。故按照非戰公約之精神。美國雖欲為不偏不倚之中立。其勢亦有所不能。今次衆院之修正文以隨機處置之權授予總統。並縮短中立之期限。可謂能顧全非戰公約之精神。與美參院原案之徒求廻避歐洲之戰爭漩渦而不問是非曲直者。固不可同日而語也。</p>

<h3 id="c77">孔子日常生活與禮儀廉恥之詮釋 <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— 孔祥熙</p>
<p>中國自漢以來，尊崇孔子。舉凡國家政治經濟之設施，人民思想生活之軌範，無一不以孔子之道為準，民族生命繼續延長，東方文化發揚光大，二千餘年，莫敢或廢，慨自海禁大開，歐風東漸，國人突失自信，安危之見解殊途，取舍之觀念不一，醉心近代學說者，每多好奇立異甚至倡為推翻孔道之論，根本既搖，世風漸下，憂時先覺，　焉傷之。祥熙忝為　先聖子孫，又習聞　先總理恢復固有道德以救中國之說，當此民族為衰危，亟圖振救之時，原欲於退食餘聞，就管見所及，將　先聖之思想言行發為論著，而以論語為中心。恭逢　先聖誕辰，故敢先以　先聖日常生活之遺規，與其關於禮儀廉恥之遺訓，製為表解。雖時代不同，先聖之所言所行未必一一可以模仿，然全國同胞儻能師其嚴格而有規律之精神，則社會之生活習慣，自當為之一變，而後國家興復事業之任，乃得以共同努力，此祥熙之微意也。其一曰　先聖日常生活，分物質精神談話三者。物質則衣食居行，已足以樹新生活標準。精神則有奮鬥中和快樂安慰親愛謙勉敬謹通達之著，談話則有雅言罕言不語之分。儀型所垂，萬流是式。其二曰　先聖論禮儀廉恥，論語中有禮字，無理字；蓋　聖人納民於軌物之中，原不欲空談性理，是故禮也者履也，所以使人共履行之者也。今為揭其綱領，區其條目。義者宜也，裁制事物使合宜也。論語於處境取財接物制事發言事君使民，示義路以共由，俾民彝之有則。廉者歛也，自檢歛也，引伸為立行清廉，能自攝歛之稱，論語中一廉字，古之矜也廉，初非廉潔之訓，唯公緯之不欲，先儒以廉字釋之。夫養廉之儉，臨財之道，崇廉之效，與夫義利之辦，抑何其深切著明也。恥之為字，從耳從心：蓋取聞過自愧之意，凡人心慙，則耳熟面赤，是其騐也。中庸知恥近乎勇　王船山謂恥易而知難，恥必知擇而後可謂有恥。今觀論語中諄諄於恥之為教，故列舉行已與人化民交鄰四大端，以明所擇。末附以孔門各學派之分衍，并各加說明，冀與邦人君子之崇孔學談國是者共商榷焉！</p>

<p>陳灃東塾讀書記「論語言禮者凡四十餘章。自親聽言動，與幾事親教子，事君使臣，使民為國，莫不以禮，其所以為禮者，曰敬曰讓曰約曰節曰文之，其本在儉，其用在和，而先之以仁之守，義之質，學之博，先進後進不同，則從先進，禮雖廢而猶愛之，夏殷禮不足徵而猶能言之。射不主皮之語，則述儀禮之文也，鄉黨一篇，則皆禮記之類也，論語之言禮，至博至精，探索之而靡盡也。論語所言皆禮也，以其小者觀之。如趨過者，子見父之禮：沐浴者，臣朝君之禮；行束修者，弟子初見師之禮；非公事不至者，士人見官長之禮；三衍者，侍坐之失禮；居於位與先生並行者，　子之失禮：小者如此，大者可知也。」</p>

<p>第三章　光明之路</p>
<p>星期一早晨乃德走進課室的時候，他的中心不無畏餒，因為他深恐將要暴露他的愚蠢於大眾了。然而裴先生偏給他嵌入窗畔深處的一個坐位，他坐時以背向着別人，并且派拂朗去指導他的功課，因此沒有別的人會聽到他的錯誤或者會見到他書法簿上墨跡的狼藉。他見到這個情形真是感激，因此十分努力做去，所以裴先生後來瞧見了他熱烘烘的臉兒及烏黑黑的指頭，便笑說道：</p>
<p>「不要用功得太辛苦了，我的孩子；怕你要做乏了，儘可稍為舒舒泰泰做去」。</p>
<p>但是我必得辛苦用功，要不然我就不能趕上別人。他們知道一大堆的東西，我一點也不知道」乃德說道，他真是陷入於失望的境界，聽到別的　童子們對答史地文法，他覺得是熟極而流了。</p>
<p>「可是你也知道許多他們所不知道的」，裴先生說道，坐在他的一旁，其時拂朗已去領導一班小學生經略稅法九九的迷陣。「真的嗎？」乃德看去，似乎不能相仿裴先生剛才道一句話。</p>
<p>「真的；第一事，你能够控制你的脾氣，而精於計算數目的解客偏反不能；這是一檣極重要的功課，我想你倒已經學好了。再則你會彈提琴，這裏卻沒有一個童子會的，雖然這也是他們所很企望的。但是最好的一件，乃德，你真有意思想學一些，有了這個，彷彿已經是上了學問的一半路程了。這起初似乎不容易，你要感覺氣餒，然而儘管忍着做去，那末一路上去時，自然覺得各事逐漸容易起來的」。</p>

<p>棉巿八月期依然挺拔、今爲最後一日、市價步步上升、足見多方軋空力量之雄壯也、最後一盤價爲三十六元、比上月之三十五元五角、尙漲五角、但遠月新棉因邇來天氣順　、新棉漸次登塲、且各廠停工者太多、消費　然减少云、</p>

<p>— 李晴</p>
<p>自民十五以來，祀孔的大典被廢已久，去年國府定八月二十七日孔子誕辰為國定紀念日，通令各機關各團體休假紀念，幷舉行隆重紀念之典禮，儀式雖和從前不同，但却勾起了我早年參預祀孔回憶，拉雜寫來，以吿讀者。</p>
<p>江陰的禮延書院，本來自和文廟在一起的。辛亥以還，書院改辦學校，於是才把房子隔離開來。筆者從前在禮延讀書，曾二次被選為舞生，按祀孔須舞生七十二人，樂生二十四人，統稱樂舞生。樂生受有經騐者之指揮，歌詠大同之章，舞生則左手持盾，右手持戟，進退跪伏，孔子顧而樂焉。</p>
<p>我們午夜起身，進校中　備之稀飯，然後各穿一種道袍似的靑綢禮服，學士帽式的四方帽子，整隊出發至文廟，準備參加典禮時間本為上午二時，但主祭人員往往為吸食雅片的懶虫，到廟時總已天明，在那遷延的時間中，我們四處觀光，太牢少牢，大盤陳列，不知孔子及其門徒，為什麼一定要吃全牛全羊，留給人家一個粗野的印象？</p>
<p>祭禮旣開始，各式各樣的古銅塊，便有專家似的文人在那里從容敲擊，雖是古樂，但其聲音却宛如「瓦釜齊鳴」四字所形容的那樣，使懂點音樂的人都感覺不到它的美妙，至於若干銅塊，在花紋的雕刻上講，倒是頗有藝術意味的。</p>
<p>凡是參預祭禮的人，各有酬勞。卽以樂舞生而論，便有兩隻牛腿，一隻羊，樂生二十四個饅頭，舞生十六個饅頭。除牛羊直接付予外，饅頭則以票子之形式分發之。每票四個，持票卽可向指定的饅頭店調換。不過如係有面子的學生，被選倒還不如不被選的好，因被選之後，總得將一兩張票子分給未被選的知友，自己頂多祗能享用三張，卽十二個，而未被選呢，則東討一張，西要一張，有時反能弄到七八張，超過舞生所得一倍，這種不勞而獲的人，當然也祗限於學生中的特殊階級。</p>

<p>他將茶房叫了來，正色道：這次和藍專員同來的裘秘書長，是我的親戚。我這裏有一封信，你給我送了去。說着，將信交到茶房手上，同時拿了一張二十枚的銅子票，也給了他，笑道：這算給你買一盒烟捲抽。可是有一層，你把我這封信，必得交到裘秘書長手上。他為人是很謙遜，不願人家叫他秘書長，只要人叫他書記。書記不大好聽，你就稱呼他裘先生好了。那個中央大員，他也不是要人稱呼他先生嗎？茶房臉上，帶了淡笑，將銅子票丢在桌上道：我有烟捲抽，不要你的錢。說着，拿了信向外走。張介夫追到外面來，叫道：我這封信很要緊，你必定交到裘先生手上。那茶房頭也不回，拿了信只管向前走。介夫呆站在走廊下，很是後悔，心裏想着，若是交給他一毛錢，他或者就髙興的。旣然慷慨起來，就該慷慨到底，於今省下二三十枚銅子，這倒恐怕妨碍了自己的事情　正如此想着發呆呢，李士　老遠的由房裏出來就向介夫深深的作了兩個揖。笑道：恭喜恭喜。介夫正在想心事的時候，被他突然的恭喜着，却有些莫明其妙，睜了兩隻眼，只管向他望。李士廉笑道：那位藍專員來了，可以和你找着一個位置了，這豈不是一塲喜事嗎？（三〇〇）</p>

<p>— 張慕良</p>
<p>在虹口一帶，祗要提起了豆腐西施的名字，那是可以說得婦孺皆知的。</p>
<p>豆腐西施不詳其姓名，祗知伊家里是開豆腐店的，因為伊生有一副怪討人歡喜的臉兒的綠故，所以人的就給伊這樣的一個雅號。伊平日的處世藝術是很有研究的，在老太婆面前會說佛法無邊：在老頭子面前會感慨着世道艱　；這種待人的手腕，使人感到很舒服的。况且在伊伶俐的嘴上，叔叔，伯伯，阿姨，好婆……的口吻，更是多麼動聽呵！</p>
<p>可是近來豆腐西施對於裝飾上終是打扮得花枝招展似的學起漂亮來了，就是待人方面，也搭起十足的架子來了。</p>
<p>祗要伊打扮好出去的時候，那幾個愛管閑事的鄰人便會打趣着說：「喔唷！時髦阿姐來了！……那知人家對伊這樣打趣後，畢竟帶起一副寡婦式的臉，像煞有介事，一睬也不睬你的，由於這個綠故，却引起一般人的懷疑了，或許伊在外面有什麽花頭。</p>
<p>大概又是幾個月之後，據說豆腐西施再也不打扮花枝招展的出去了，一天到晚的睡在家裏。</p>
<p>「唉！好一個漂亮的小姑娘死了！件在豆腐西施隔壁的好婆走來向人家說。</p>
<p>後來大家都明白伊是墮胎而死的，這極悽慘的結局　們祇有替伊惋情！</p>
<p>於是在虹口一帶，再也聽不到伊的芳名了！</p>

<p>于是我就　其　知的給伊解釋法國染髮藥的質料，　　，和　用　　，可是我自己　知道的化　常　　實太少了，　不能給伊　　得怎　明白：伊倒也很能　諒我，聽過便算了，並不怎　　究我對於搽藴、後的功效郤　淸楚，便　　一點　別的給伊說得明白　，結果是居　很　力地使伊　動了。</p>
<p>「奴才從這　寫信到法國去定購」，最後，我又說道：「再　他們從法國把藥品寄來：這樣一來一去，最快總得費四五十天才能辦到，太后不嫌太遲嗎？」</p>
<p>「不遲，不遲，四五十天在人的一生中，眞是怎樣短的一刹那啊」？太后似乎很能忍耐地答道：一如其你以為他們　染　藥　　有特殊的功效的話，我們是很　意試一試的」。</p>
<p>這件事就像這樣决定了，我因為太后已允許我能給伊出力，心上眞　說不出的高興。，退値之後，便忙　找一個太　上我家裏去吿訴父　，要他馬上打電報到巴黎去，托一位相熟的朋友代我們　購幾種頂好的染髮藥，趕快寄來。（四〇〇）</p>

<h3 id="c178">御夫有術的希佛來夫人 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>法闌西電影明星希佛來氏，在美國好萊塢主演「璇宮艷史」「　湘夜深時」「風流婦」諸巨片，因爲他的風流　灑，突梯滑稽，博得全世界觀衆的歡迎，尤其是女性，非常的歡喜他，因此有世界大情人之稱。</p>
<p>英國某週刊記者李女士特地往訪希佛來的夫人，問伊對於伊丈夫被女性愛慕，可有什麼意見？夫人便回答了以下的一番話：</p>
<p>「我眼見得我的丈夫這樣的受人歡迎，心中是非常快樂的，他能博得許多女性的愛慕，自在意料之中。這也是他一部分的工作。</p>
<p>「個人有了嫉妒心，還能找到什福辛福呢？嫉妒和幸福，是决不能　手同行的。我當然明白女性們都愛我的丈夫，因為我也這般的愛他</p>
<p>「我以爲你要是愛你的丈夫，應當帶一些慈母愛子的意味，譬如你是一位慈母，就不能自私自利了。你一定要瞧你的兒子常常快樂。</p>
<p>「今日之世，有許多人的生活中，充滿了不快樂的事情。要是我的丈夫能使他們得到一些樂趣，這是再好也沒有了。我决不會忘却人家都沒有我的幸運。</p>
<p>「况且夫婦之間，倘能互相信任，那就不願意使對方不快。做女人的，要是常常多疑而嫉妒，那麽做男子的就覺得「這有什麼用呢？我索性幹壞事去。」我的話可不是麼？</p>
<p>「一個妻子倘能給伊丈夫過快樂的光陰，忘却一切的憂慮和煩惱，那麼做丈夫的也當然樂於和伊厮守在一起了。</p>
<p>「一個男子總要找尋一個能够安慰他的人，消磨他閒暇的時光，他要好好的舒適一下，忘去一切的事情。他希望他的妻子陪伴着給他甜蜜的安慰。這些事情可不是女人們很容易辦到的麽？所以他的妻子要是不能給與他，他當然要向趴人去要了。</p>
<p>「夫與妻决不能彼此都做領袖。我想還是讓做丈夫的當一些權，來得自然些。因爲他當起　來是比女人適合些的。</p>
<p>「但是這並不是說女人是應當屈服的。要是御夫有術，伊不是一樣的可做主子麽？</p>
<p>我想一個人對於婚姻必須不斷的工作，然後方能美滿，所以我嫁與我的丈夫時，願意拋棄我的前程。我覺得自巳要是繼續我的歌舞生活，那我决不能給他造成一個良好的家庭。我把全部的時間放在家庭中的職務上，在我以為這是很關重要的。</p>
<p>「我知道我的丈夫對於我擔任家務，表示敬意，正如我對於他一樣。雙方各盡其責，决沒有重要和不重要的區別，不過我們倆，一個是在羣衆的眼前顯耀　，一個是在後方顯耀罷了。但是後方的切正與前方的一樣重要。</p>
<p>「當初我要拋棄我那辛苦掙來的前程時，也覺得依依不捨；因為我從此不再是舞臺上的鳳娜范麗，而開始做希佛來夫人了。但你如今可以相信我是樂於如此，可是一個人能得到良人的愛，和快樂的家庭生活，什麽事都沒有比這個更可滿意的了。女人對於這些事情的需要，實在一切名譽和誇獎之上。</p>
<p>「我的丈夫在主演一部影片時，他是工作得很辛苦，所以我就得設法保護他，不受一些子煩惱的襲擊，好讓他專新於他的工作。你要明白我是常常想使他無憂無慮的。</p>
<p>「他對於工作很有責任心，從不滿意於他過去的成績。往往一片　成，他又在擔心着預備下一部影片了。</p>
<p>「所以我的丈夫回來時，我總設法使他忘却攝影塲中的一切，我們只談講着許多有趣味的事。他說說笑笑，他的心也就放開了。但他有時因工作上發生困難，要討論他的計劃，如此我就悄悄地聽着。我不發表什麼意見，因為他畢竟知道得比我多呀！我在一　鼓勵他，使他髙興起來。這是對於任何男子都很重要的。第二天，他便可振作精神，出去繼續他的工作，凡是做妻子的對於這一點，應當牢牢記着。</p>
<p>「當然囉！我的丈夫也有一些脾氣，不然，他也不成其為一個偉大的藝人了。但他並不像別的藝人們，無緣無故地發脾氣的。在他發脾氣時，我就走了開去，讓他一個人坐在那裏。這可不是最好的方法麽？」</p>

<h3 id="c179">風格與模仿 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— 伊峯</p>
<p>在目前流行的文體中，時常聽到人說，某某是有屠格湼夫的風格的，某某是富有高爾基作風的，某某又是接近某某的，諸如此類的比擬，實在是『司空見慣』，毫不為怪了。</p>
<p>這種比擬之於時流作家，實是含有無比的毒害的，遮蓋過他所戴起的無上的榮冠。</p>
<p>一個作家，本來是肯埋頭在寫作上努點力的，在開始，也許有意無意地模仿別人的風格，久而久之，不知不覺他的作品因也渲染上某某的影響，這是常有的事實。但這，决不能說他巳成功了某某，或即某某的再生，這也是極明白的。因為無論如何的模仿，作者在其作品中决不會沒有自己存在。有他自己，則他的學得像幾分之幾？他這存在的自己是怎樣的一個自己？處處都成了疑問。如果說他這自己祗是充滿了愚味和頑固，或者他所模仿的畢竟是骨董或化石，則這種作者和這種作品根本就是一架沒魂靈的僵屍，霉毒滿身的腐物了。</p>
<p>幸而他這所模仿的，就說巳成功某人的幾分之幾，而某人的模特兒又是適合於當前的風格，但他自己的「野心」和發展不能與之相適應，這學成功的幾分之幾的某人，又算得上什麼哩！</p>
<p>關於這點，革拉特珂夫說得最明白了。他在「我怎樣寫士敏土」裏寫着：</p>
<p>「我不自問：托爾斯泰，屠格湼夫，妥斯退夫斯基，或者高爾基如何寫這個，說那個。這問題我想都沒有想過；即使想到，我一定要驅逐這思想，這不特是不必要，而且還有害；因為不然我將依附於模範，而失掉了我創作的自由。」</p>
<p>從這裏，就可看出還位文學上的巨人是怎樣成功他的偉大。自己創造抑祗會模仿？</p>
<p>看他再寫下去：</p>
<p>「承繼藝術，是包括决心地克服前代的風格，而這就是完成自己的風格……</p>
<p>「困難並不在於如何利用舊有的藝術方法（沒有比模仿更便當的了），而是在怎樣創造自己獨特的方法，在藝術思潮中，證明出是一個新的美的階段。」</p>
<p>這就更加明白淸楚了，說明一個作家在寫作上，該是一偭怎樣卓立的態度，建立自己的獨特的風格。</p>
<p>靑年作家也應該虛心地從前輩開明的作家多方面去學習是對的，但不是模仿。一個作家，會無心底地在修養上接受了誰某的影響，那也不是壞事情，流於一味模仿，便要不得了。這傾向是不能讓它長遠發展下去的，更不要說變得專門去刻意模仿了。</p>
<p>因此，上述的「司空見慣」的比擬，造成的不是偉大作家的新風格，而祗有時流作家的狂妄與更加刻意模仿。</p>

<p>那女人尖銳地呌了一聲，打了一個滾，四肢立刻仲開來，挺直在地上！</p>
<p>「不買票敢坐我們外國人的船，你這爛　！……」他趕上前來加駡着，儼然自己原就是外國人似的。</p>
<p>母親急了！她擠出去拉住着麻子，怕他踢第二脚；一面却抗議似的責問道：</p>
<p>「你爲什麽打她呢？這樣兇！……你不曾看見他的懹着小孩的肚子嗎？』</p>
<p>「不出錢好坐我們外國人的船嗎？」麻子滿面紅星地反問母親；一面瞅着他的賬房先生的臉相。</p>
<p>「那麽，不過是——錢…………」</p>
<p>「嗯！錢！……」另外一個茶房加重地說。</p>
<p>母親沉思了一下，沒有來得及想出來對付的辦法，那個女人便在地上大聲地呻吟了起來！一部份的看客，也立時開始了驚疑的，緊急的議論。但那個拿棍子的茶房却髙髙地舉起了棍子，企圖繼續地撲打下來</p>
<p>母親横衝去將茶房攔着；並且走近那個女人的身邊，用了絕大的憐憫底眼光，看定她的大肚子。突然地，她停住了呻吟，渾身瘁孿地縮成一團，眼睛突出，牙齒緊咬着下唇，喊起肚子痛來了！母親慌張地蠻着腰，蹲了下去，用手替她在肚子上慢慢地，一陳陣地，撫摸起來。並且，因了過度地憒怒的緣故，大聲地駡署着殘暴的茶房，替她喊出了危險的，臨盆的徵候！</p>
<p>看客們都紛紛地退後了。賬房先生嫌惡地，狠狠地唾了一口，也趕緊走了開。茶房們因為不得要領，狗一般的跟着，回駡着一些汚穢的惡語，一直退進到自己的艙房。</p>
<p>我也轉身要走了，但母親將我呌住着：吩咐立即到自己的舖位子上去，扯下那床黄色的毯子來；並且借一把剪刀和一根細麻繩子。</p>
<p>我去了。忽忙地穿過那些探奇的，紛紛議論的人羣，拿着東西回來的時候，母親巳經解下那個女人的下身了。地上横流着一大灘穢水。她的嘴唇被牙齒咬得出血，額角上冒出着豆大的汗珠，全身痛苦地，艱難地掙扎着！她一看見我，就羞慚地將臉轉過去，兩手亂搖！但是，立時間，一個細小的紅色的嬰兒，穢血淋漓地鑽出來了！在地上跌了一個翻身，哇哇地哭訴着她那不可知的命運！</p>
<p>我連忙轉過身去。母親費力地喘着氣，約有五六分鐘久，才將一個血淋淋地胎衣接了出來，從我的左側方拋到江心的深處。</p>
<p>「完全打下來的！」母親氣憤地舉着一雙血汚的手對我說：一他們都是一些兇惡的强盜！……那偭胎兒簡直小得帶不活。而他們還在等着向她要船錢！」</p>
<p>「那麽怎麽辦呢？」</p>
<p>「救人要救澈！……」母親用了毅然的，慈警家似的口脗說。「你去替我要一盃水來，讓我先將小孩洗好了再想辦法……」</p>
<p>太陽巳經從江左的山岸中爬上來一丈多髙了。江風緩和地吹着，完全失掉了她那夜間的狂暴的力量。從遙遠的，江流的右岸底尖端，緩緩地爬過來了一條大城市底尾巴的輪廓。</p>

<p>— S．爾塞吉夫．晋斯基作蘇明譯</p>
<p>河流更增大了，載着他在被森林罩着的髙髙的河岸，有時候是許多懸崖的中間航行。他還得注視着前面，這樣就不至於撞在水裏的大岩石上。沙瓦卡的半野蠻的眼睛能够望見水裏和岸上的大部份的有生命的東西。在西伯利亞，夏天是並不長的。八月裏，晚上巳經很冷，他需要外套了。到九月的早晨，他能够在水裏看見冰塊，突然有一天，雪開始降下來代替了雨，一陣暴風雨襲擊了他。</p>
<p>沙瓦卡打算在他過路的村子裏渡過冬天，但是在他離任何村子都還遙遠的時候，河流巳經凍結起來了。沙瓦卡把他的船拖到岸上的一塊地方，在那裏，他看到在岸的髙處有一個洞，洞口被一棵給風暴吹倒的大松樹半掩着。在松樹的枝幹上，可以像一架梯子似的爬上爬下，而這個洞原來有一間房間那麽大。沙瓦卡把所有的東西從船上帶到洞裏來，於是很快活的自己去砍些燃料。他用石頭把洞口塡塞起來，祇留下一個小小的罅隙；從松樹稀疏的地方，他給自己做成了一扇門；他安置好了一個生火的地方，又用他的斧頭開了一個通烟的洞。當他第一次在他的洞裏坐下來，而他的壺子不在露天却在一間溫暖舒適的房間裏開始沸騰的時候，他對於他的成功感到完全滿足，於是在他的松樹枝做成的床上睡着了。</p>
<p>醒來，他就去望他的船是不是平安。雪在密密的下着，一切都是寂靜的。全河流都靜默着，在夜裏蓋滿了新的堅固的冰塊。沙瓦卡高聲的說：「哦，朋友，你到了什麼地方來了！不要緊，這地方很好。沒有什麼好呌喊的。」在他的長期的孤獨中，他學會了跟自己商聲談話。他用字句是這樣簡矩和吝嗇，恰像他是亦跟別人談話一樣。</p>
<p>當冰塊凍得結實的候時，他爲第一根繩索用斧頭鑿了一個洞，再為第二根鑿了另外一個，然後安放好他的網。就這樣，他在這塊他以前從沒有知道過，就在現在，他還是一點也不知道的地方，開始渡着他的寂寞的冬天。</p>
<h3 id="c184">憶明若 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— 穆時英</p>
<p>夜雨颯颯地打到窗玻璃上來，對着案上那隻靜悄的紗燈，我想起了一些舊事，也想起了一些舊人。</p>
<p>是兩年前，也是一個下着蕭蕭秋雨的晚上，我和明若在一個小城市的旅館裏邊渡了漫漫的長夜。那是一家很古舊的旅館，躺在床上，可以聽到天花板上耗子們放恣的脚聲，隔壁一個私娼和洋布商人的切切私語，而那雨點却和今晚一樣地，悉悉地儘打到窗上來。小城市的夜是靜到只有犬吠聲和更夫的梆聲的，聽着那啼泣着的夜雨，在床上躺了一回後，我終於又在床上坐了起來，望着黝暗的油燈抽起烟來。明若也像沒有睡着，看我坐了起來，他翻過身來問道：</p>
<p>「睡不着麽」？</p>
<p>「小城市的雨眞是很難受，很難受」。</p>
<p>「聽着這不知疲倦的雨聲，談談不是很好麼」？</p>
<p>「可是，在上海，雨會使霓虹燈柔和起來，朦朧起來的。明若，你可記得雨中徬徨在街頭的一些星期六晚上麼」？</p>
<p>他像在思索一些什麼的，太息着說：「你看，不是很快，很快麼？那些日子很快的過去了！你還是一個閃鑠着生命力的靑年，我却已經是一塊灰敗的泥土了。上海，離開了上海不是已經一年了麼」？</p>
<p>茫然地，他的臉很抑鬱的樣子。這使我驚異起來。明若向是一個很明快，很有風趣，而且很懂得幽默的人；在朋友中間，他是有着「小品文」那樣的綽號的。他是一個典型的小城市居民，很喜歡享受一些屑碎的生活趣味。在預備完了功課以後，時常到校門口小飯店裏去呌幾杯可可來，一面吃着花生米，一面和我天南地北地談着，說一些不傷脾胃的俏皮話。他從來不發氣，也不會興奮，至於抑鬱，他好像是沒有這樣情緒的。那天，出於意外的，他會擺出那樣抑鬱的臉來了。也許是為了這沉沉的深夜裏的凄切的細雨吧？可是一回兒他又髙興起來了，他說：</p>
<p>「如果明天雨還不停，我們打一天牌吧。想想吧，脫了襪子，一面抽着小茄立克，捲起了袖子，第一圈摸一隻嵌八索，第二圈再摸一隻邊三萬！那麼地說着，他快樂地笑起來了。</p>
<p>「可是，明天我是無論怎樣都要回去了呢。」</p>
<p>「再住一天吧。你以爲碰頭很容易麽？出了學校，今天我們還是第一天碰頭呢。人生浮萍，知道這一次以後，幾時才能再像今天這樣談半個晚上呵。」</p>
<p>「如果下雨，就再住一天吧。」</p>
<p>可是第二天早上，醒來時，我們却看見一個給雨水洗過似的，非常澄澈的天空。那天，我終於走了。走的時候，他送我到車站，還說了呌我多寫些信的話。不如意事常八九，就是寫信那樣日常的事吧，也不大受意志的支配，回到上海後，一年裏邊只寫了兩封信。他也像不大有多餘時間似的，來信也不多。因為信疏，終於大家都擱下不寫了。</p>
<p>去年十月，他忽然寄了請柬幷附了封信來，他吿訴我就要結婚了，而且在信裏寫了底下那樣非常素樸而誠懇的話：</p>
<p>「我們的籬邊開了一串淵明菊。別了兩年了，無論怎樣忙，來看看故人，看看晴朗的鄕邨，看看故人的戀人，幷且替我們做一個儐相吧。」</p>
<p>我奔走了好幾天，預備到他的故鄕，滬杭甬綫上的一個小鎭，長安去看看老朋友，同時享幾天淸福，結果，生活是很殘酷的，這次我還是走不了。此後，他一封信也沒有來，我也只洧從旁人那裏得一些不十分詳盡的他的消息。</p>
<p>今年春天，我碰到家璧兄，他吿訴我：</p>
<p>「知道麼？盛明若沒有了。」</p>
<p>死麼？我不十分相信。我們都是很年靑的人，而且明若還是新近結了婚，又是一個有着良善的靈魂的像伙。這樣輕易地就死了麼？</p>
<p>最近錢公俠兄從明若的故鄕來，我問起他明若時，他說：</p>
<p>「死了，今年春天。」</p>
<p>眞的死了，這個良善的人！正如他說的，很快，很快，那些日子很快的過去了。那些日子……那些日子—而現在他已經躺到地下，我也已經成為一塊灰敗的泥土了！</p>
<h3 id="c185">雷雨 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 歐陽山</p>
<p>我們那個一座山一樣的朋友劉禮吿訴我們許多故事。他自己比任何一個人都更喜歡着自己所講的那些情景和人物，黑英石造成的臉就閃起逼人的光來。其中有一個描寫着雷雨。</p>
<p>「……秋天的晚上，我從横角村走路去棉村——這條路我是走熟了的，因此沒有帶電手筒。天色本來很平靜，沒有想到下雨，但是雨居然下出來了。大得很，路上的浮泥不到十分鐘都冲掉了，粗砂和小石塊都伸出了長而利的牙齒，咬到我底赤脚穿了許多洞，流出血來。」劉禮摹仿出那時的動作，這樣開始了。</p>
<p>「我一輩子沒有碰到過那麼大的雨，——更是那麼發脾氣的雷！在黑暗裏面，除了雨和牠底聲音以外，什麽都沒有。可是你們想想看：打一個電閃，這才看見了有一個世界……哆嗦地站在眼前，雨却反而似乎沒有了。有雷聲的時候，聽不見雨聲。</p>
<p>「我到一個養鵝的老人那兒去躱避。他呌做白　蟧，孤獨，體格髙大，白　子很長。我剛推開門走進他底神廳，他就大聲喝止了我。他不給我倒茶，也不拿乾衣服出來。……在牆壁上除下了兩頂竹織的雨帽，他就像我底長輩一樣敎訓着我：「這是避雨的年紀麼？跟我到鵝棚去吧，我去看看那些小東西。——你不要進去，會驚動牠們的。你有你自己可以看的東西。你喜歡看閃電的紋路和響雷的火花麼？眞不錯，幾十年來，這就是我底嗜好！不要怕牠。</p>
<p>「在鵝棚前面，我依着他底吩咐做了。我從給雨點打碎了的夜裏伸出頭來。我將我底脊骨挺得和桄榔樹一樣直。水沬刺進我底眼晴和鼻孔裏。這回不是偷望一眼，我第一次當眞看見閃電和行雷了！</p>
<p>「我不是有一頂雨帽麼，河是牠一點都不遮攔我。我巳經不能够形容，只能够感覺了！一把巨大的，曲折的，神速的劍，怎樣明晃地眩耀着我底眼睛和一切山，河，叢林底眼睛；怎樣憤怒地無情地恣意地劃破那貜腫的天空底肚子！那使劍的傢伙又是怎樣地咆哮着，吼呌着！他底聲音是一塊無比的沉重的鐵塊，摩擦出火花的時候伴着一陣淸脆的結實的爆裂音響，墜落到山上，墳堆裏，平原裏，河涌裏，就把整個地球壓得震了一震，隨後呼出呻吟的回聲，……繼續着，在不能計算那麽久的時間裏都不會停止。</p>
<p>「那把劍會冷不防地挿在你身邊。沒有什麽可怕的，這巳經不是害怕的時候……你會覺得你自己突然縮小了，沒有了內臟，腦筋，思想，記憶，你覺得只剩了一塊小木片，那就是你自己。你旁邊是一堵無限髙的，單純由光組成的牆壁。</p>

<p>— 馮善樑醫生</p>
<p>神經衰弱症，雖有腦髓性紳經衰弱及脊髓性神經衰弱之別，同時發生本症之原因，亦互異不一，有來自精神過勞，有來自淫慾過度，然在治療本症時，以燐質直接補充之，為不可或缺的療法之一。</p>
<p>「安爾神」西文名Arolsen，係有機性燐化合物，較其他燐製劑含量特多物，此種化合物在穀類及植物根莖等內，均有豐富之貯藏，如大麥，小麥玉蜀黍，碗豆，扁豆，葱，蘿葡之中，皆含有此化合物。</p>
<p>有機性燐化合物乃人體各部組織，　器之要素，舉凡血液，筋肉，肝肫，腎肫及肺肫等，均含此品甚夥，而尤以神經及腦髓為甚，</p>
<p>燐質對於人體之需要，巳可知其里大若此，通常胃腸消化力薄弱，同化力减退及燐質消耗過度者，則非以燐質直接補充之不可，</p>
<p>燐質之用於治療界，由來巳久，然能以之為神經衰弱及發育不良之有效滋養品者，可謂近代學術界之新進步，　所需要者，為有機性燐質，故欲求有效之　質製劑，當以採取有機性者為標準矣。（編者按：「安爾神」係有機性燐質與鈣等之化合物，凡需要燐質以補充之病息，都可用之，亦可作為營養品，如病後體弱，身心過勞，營養不良，萎黄病，貧血，骨質軟化，神經系官能病，神經衰弱，希司忒利，精神病等症，俱可服用本品，經理處上海法租界八仙橋敏體尼蔭路老德行里一號仁壽西藥社每盒一元五角，永安先施西藥部均有發售。）</p>

<p>— 醫師佘雷</p>
<p>有鴉片癮者。其體內必具有抗鴉片毒素及中和鴉片毒素。換言之。其體內之細胞與鴉片煙毒相結合。因此能耐常人所不能耐之煙量。因此必須逐日與以適宜煙量之消耗。</p>
<p>戒煙之法維何。驅除此與細胞相結合之煙毒而已。雖然在施戒時必須將被戒者所有之夙疾—被鴉片所障蔽之夙疾。盡行治愈。方得妥為戒絕。但剷除此煙癮之方法。到底為在戒煙上所不可或缺之手段。</p>

<p>— 佘雷醫師</p>
<p>本症固有之症狀。在消化時以外。即胃臟空虛時。亦分泌胃液。故名。或曰分泌過多症。但胃臟在空虛時。原有少量液存在。若胃臟空虛時而有二十西西乃至三十西西以上之胃液時。幷同時有胃症者。始為本病無疑。</p>
<p>發生本病之原因。雖大都由于精神感動及胃之刺戟而來。然共主要原因。不得不歸諸神經性素質。本症或獨立性發生。或與胃潰瘍。幽門狹窄性運動不全症同發。</p>
<p>患本症者之自覺的症候。與胃酸過多症相類。有種種消化障碍。食前或食後數小時間。覺胃部疼痛。吐大量之胃液。食慾通常比較的旺盛。大便多秘結。他覺的症候。在空腹時。聽診胃部有表在性振水音。檢視吐物。則稀薄如水樣。又因所吐物中含有純粹之胃液。繼因運動障碍。胃液中恒混有食物殘渣。</p>
<p>欲確實診斷本症。須於早晨空腹時。再三試騐之。</p>
<p>本症係慢性症候。且易再發。故根治匪易。</p>
<p>治療本症時。食餌療法具器械療法。概與胃酸過多症同。藥物療法。常用亞爾加里劑硝酸銀內服。有謂洗胃為本病最良之療法。幷云以早晨爲宜。</p>
<p>（編者按：亞爾加里劑為本症所不可或缺之藥療法。在此類藥劑中而尤以上海法租界八仙橋敏體尼蔭路老德行里一號。仁壽西藥社所經售之胃實為最優。輕症服一盒卽可痊愈。聞每盒僅售二元。郵寄加一云。）</p>

<p>淋病。首次感染到的。什九是急性前部尿道淋。鮮有侵及後尿道者。惟任意置之或醫未斷根。則淋菌潛伏繁殖。其擴大之範圍。侵及之部分。很難預料。臨證上所習見者。如淋毒性關節炎。睪丸炎等是。</p>
<p>然明知是尿道局部的病患。則只須行局所的治療巳足够了。更何須採用各種其他辦法。此乃因局部的治療。難奏全功之故。攷淋病局部治療之藥品。最被推獎而當用者。厥惟蛋白化銀。如Protargol及Choleval等。凡此數種。雖為較優之品。只要醫生能妥為施用。可能達到不損尿道粘膜。而克殺淋菌之效。然潛在深層之淋菌。非此藥力所克奏功。因此。最近醫藥界對於淋病外用藥。又有新的發現。新的造就。德國滿爾志大藥廠出品之「淋毒舒樂耳」。係用淋病血淸製成膠樣物。使甩時注入於尿道內者也。經我臨床試用。確比上述諸藥顯效多矣。急性淋病。使用二三次後。巳不感痛苦。惟使用楚藥時。須注意者要全佈尿道粘膜之發炎面。即淋菌佔據之區。否則遺留一二。恐難根治。再應用本品時同時須兼顧到消炎去腫。防止陰莖勃起及遺精等疾息。幷諸生殖泌尿器之消毒。是以不得不兼施內服藥品。淋病內服藥。根據個人臨證經騐。必須適合如下條件方為聖品。（一）須無刺戟性。則不會發胃腸障碍及引起腎臟炎症。蛋白尿等。（二）殺菌力强大。則克奏尿路消毒之功。（一）無收斂藥成份。則不致有淋病假愈之虞。（四）藥力能深透粘膜。則潛在粘膜深處之淋菌。得克盡殺。（五）消炎去腫。能鎭靜性神經。則可防止勃起與遺精。美備此五大特點之淋病聖藥。經我所習用無疑者。厥惟美靈洋行品之「滅殺淋」Mesaltropin。滅殺淋眞乃淋病內服藥中之翹楚。（編者按。淋病外用藥「淋毒舒樂耳」及淋病內服藥「滅殺淋」二藥均歸上海法租界八仙橋敏體尼蔭路老德行里一號仁壽西藥社經售。前者每罐二元五角。後者每盒一元。郵遞加一寄費。）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3 id="c192">從「兒童年」說到「兒童」戲劇 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 旅岡</p>
<p>今年，是個多難的年頭，烽火，水，旱……兼以外患頻仍，眞是比之無論那一年都要慘痛些，說它是空前未有的災年，似乎也不爲太過。然而不意却自今年的八月一日起，倒被國定爲「兒童年」了。在這麼一個多難之年而能特別注意及兒童們的生活，這似乎不能爲我們一大羣的孩子們慶的。</p>
<p>現在，「兒童年」旣巳開始，一般人于是就忙于爲「兒童年」慶祝，並且，致力于爲兒童文化及種種事業而「努力」了，而其最「努力」者，還是一股商人，他們爲兒童們製衛生糖果，爲兒童們造新式服裝，玩具，爲兒童們出版大量的兒童書籍，甚至于素來沒有注意及兒童的電影商，今年以后也準備大量產生兒童的影片了。這麽浩浩蕩蕩而來的一大串，的確是够使兒童們開心的。只可惜的是：這些幸福只能給一些有錢的孩子們去享受，一般流浪街頭的野孩子，依舊只是望梅止渴，絲毫也分沾不到的。所以，我想，假如眞的要定下一「兒童年」的話，那就非給野孩子們定下一個「野孩子年」不可，因爲到底兩種孩子們的地位太懸殊，是不能混在一起的，象班台萊夫底「錶」里的那種野孩子，能夠得到那末良好的敎養的機會，在中國根本就找不着。</p>
<p>可是記又得說轉來，中國的特殊環境到底和別的國家有些異樣，雖則不能象宿命論者似的說，要等待若干年以后，而目前一下子還不能馬上做得到這個地步，也倒是千眞萬確的。何况，目前我國猶是陷在水深火熱中的多難之年呢？</p>
<p>由于看了班臺萊夫的「錶」，頗有不少人在發表了一些感慨之類的意見，有些人還恐怕我們依樣畫葫蘆，所以一聽到有人爭着要改編這篇童話做電影，于是就不免有些異議，結果也就沒人再編下去了。其實這倒用不着担心的，我想，假如編劇者要是有點眼光的話，他一定很清楚地看到目前中國的情形，就着「中國的情形」去改編（改編！）至少已非完全和要作一樣了！而且我以為改編「錶」的意義，總比有人改編「愛的敎育」來得切實一些，因為這兒所說的不是空想，而是事實。</p>
<p>因此，我就想起一般愛好戲劇的野孩子來了。他們的戲劇都是非常簡單而且切竇于他們的生活的。他們愛好的是木人戲，影子戲，大戲，……有時，他們自己也簡單的用自己的破衣服、短竹竿之類，幾個人合在一團，就做起戲來，他許他們並沒有想到這是爲了玩耍，還是爲了什麼，但是他們是跟一般孩子們之愛好戲劇，倒是一樣的。只是他們沒有　錢到戲院去看戲，到學校去　劇，而只是在街頭看看街頭戲，和玩之三不象的「兒童戲一而已。</p>
<p>大家似乎都承認戲劇跟電影是涵有敎育的意義的，那末，我想，在目前哄熱地提出兒童電影的攝製的現在，兒童戲劇似乎也是一件不可忽略的事吧？而且，我想，用街頭劇去敎育一般野孩子們，總比之強迫他們去讓識字班的興趣來得濃厚一些。就是一般較爲「幸福」的兒童，對於訓練他們成爲一批兒童劇的演員，以及提供他們看一些簡單而有意義的戲劇，倒也跟給他們看電影一樣需要的。</p>

<p>— 耶戈</p>
<p>趕過七尺嶺，下了山坡，我底背後突然聽見有人在吆喝着：「咦！朋友，相等一會兒」。我止住步，回頭去看時原來郤是一個賣釘莓子的老人，挑着擔沉重的擔子，頂着七月天的炎陽，從嶺頂氣吁喘喘的趕下來。我默等他到了，便又開步走動起來。</p>
<p>他從肩膊上扯下毛巾，揩去了面上的汗珠，緊跟在我底屁股後走着，嘴裏憂慮地喃着：</p>
<p>「這樣的天氣……熱昏了人……三十年來沒見哩」。</p>
<p>我沒有去理會他，趕着自己的路，心裏在盤算着走過了的路程。</p>
<p>天氣過了大小暑後，便一直酷熱着，太陽火輪也似的在天上巡遊着。</p>
<p>賣莓子的老人，跑起路來像爬也似的，一會子我掉頭去看時，又不知不覺的掉在遠遠的後方了。他焦急而又氣悶的，用着可憐的聲調大聲喊道：</p>
<p>「咦！好朋友，看看老年人的面上，再等我一次吧」！我又祇得再把擔兒停下，躱在路旁的一株楊柳樹下等他。他便拐着兩隻短腿兒爬着趕過來，也把擔兒歇下。這回他可怕我又要馬上趕路使得他趕不上，丟在僻靜的山嶺上零零落落的，便說道：</p>
<p>「這麽悶熱的天氣，也得停下來歇息歇息，莫的這麽急急忙忙的，横直早市已趕不上了「。</p>
<p>我想想他底話倒也說得有道理，便答應他歇下，不過我郤說：</p>
<p>「這兒的柳蔭不好歇息，還是到前面的松林裏去吧」！</p>
<p>他起初有點猶豫，後來也就同意了。我們挑起了擔兒慢慢的走，他很興奮，已不像剛才那麼悶悶的，大聲的嘲笑着天氣之毫無道理的變熱，莓子價格的低落，窮人的生活難等等。我偶也從他底話中挿進一兩句，對他底話加以贊同或解釋。他亢奮極了，在我底背後大聲的讚嘆道：</p>
<p>「這一代的年靑人，我說都有毛病兒的，像你老這麽懂事明理的少着哩一。</p>
<p>我們邊說邊走地巳不知不覺的到了山坡下的松林裏了。我們揀了一個可以坐下歇息的地方把擔兒放下，從頭上解下竹箬拿在手上　風。老人自己揀好了一株松樹根上坐下，又叫我坐在他底對　　　　　　　　，從　　　出　煙筒來，裝滿了一斗悠然自得的抽着。過了一筒，他底精神變得更爲活潑亢奮了，沒來由的大聲說道：</p>
<p>「好朋友你知道這松林裏的故事嗎一？我搖了搖頭，他便笑起來。「是這樣，三年前的一個六月天莓子正當上市的季節，我從四村販來了一戴紅莓子，請一個挑夫挑着從這兒過。那是一個悶熱的天氣，太陽火般的燙人。趕下嶺來我們便都熱得走不動了，便歇息在這松林裏。你想，我們歇下還不到一頓飯的時辰，松林裏便發出了一陣悽慘的嗚咽，我們也不知道怎的越聽越覺得膽寒起來。那個挑夫嚇的面靑口白，全力顫抖叫聲。「苦啊」！便昏過去了。我也嚇的不知怎好，抜開步就跑，望那有人烟的地方跑。</p>
<p>「我沒命的跑着，也不知正跑了多少時辰，郤在一個村裏停止。心想那一戴莓子，便大聲喊救。村裏人很快的跑出來把我圍上，我便一五一十的吿訴了他們。當時大家非常吃驚，糾結了　足有一百個左右，提刀舞槍直奔松林裏來。我底紅莓子和那個挑夫一起不見了，我不禁叫起苦來，大家便安慰我道：「定在裏面」！於是我們便進了林去，轉彎抹角也不知跑過了多少路程，便有人在地下發現了血跡，再跑進去看郤又一整條小足女人的大腿，血淋淋的掛在樹上，同時又有人聽到了幽幽的哭聲，這一嚇大家可都顧不了一切，亂跑起來。</p>
<p>「從此這兒便傳說有活魔鬼出現，人家害怕着再也不敢從這兒經過。剛才我所以叫你相等，就是怕自己一個不方便，現在我們有兩個伴着，還怕什麽哩」！</p>
<p>老人說罷他底故事，烟癮也上足了，興奮的說聲。「我們走吧」！大家便又開始走起路來。</p>

<p>— 小綺</p>
<p>二十年前光着條赤身子出去，在二十年後的個把月前依然光着條赤身子回來的三喜伯眞像夢似的，一貶眼便是半輩子的時日過去了，三喜伯如今是迎着五十近邊的歲數了，但他却沒有一種老邁的人的衰頽模樣，目光還狠銳利，也還能在烈日之下趕遠路，他的身子則胖得……像什麼那只有用一頭擁腫的母猪來形容了。現在是盛夏的末梢，胖子是挺怕熟的，三喜伯尤其怕，他渾身全是一層一層的肉的摺疊，每天太陽纔露了面，他便跑出去，跑到屋子外一堆大榕樹下吹風，一方狂揮着扇子，但是汗水依有一大串一大串的吊下來，驟雨似的於是三喜伯從早到晚只穿了一條短袴，上身全裸着，大肚皮突出來，可還一勁兒熱煞人地叫呀嚷着。於是他一天之間必然要冲三五次的井水澡……</p>
<p>三喜伯離開鄕土足整二十年的時間，結果却變成一個窮癟三，已經够使他一家人深深地失望，此外；竟又帶了一種更叫人希望惡癖好——喝酒，每天三頓飯他有二頓非有一盅酒沾喉簡直便連飯都喫不下，可是他的酒量並不見高明，酒性又壞，三兩杯酒灌下肚，臉卽刻紅烘烘，搖晃着身子，一步一顚地，從店里拐到家里，又從家里拐到店里，或者便一股屁坐在家的門檻上邊，張開他那發沙的沉滯的咽子，在大夥人的前邊，哇啦哇啦地混說起來：</p>
<p>—阿昌不把我瞧在眼底了，他還認我是他的老子麽？</p>
<p>在酒意朦朧中他總是特別埋怨着自己的兒子阿昌，甚至罵上嘴。他是老了，並且有幾分在趁酒性發作，沒人跟他計較，沒個合他作答腔，讓他獨自嚕囌不休着。大家勸他回屋子好好去睏一睏，別動氣傷了寒。有時他自己的話還沒拉扯完，已就不能支持地，「砰隆」一聲，從門檻上翻倒到地上，而等待他的兒子來扶他回屋子里，別人對於他沉重的身體是沒氣力去過問的，只有凈站着瞧，每一次就常常以這樣滑稽的塲面來做結束。</p>
<p>三喜伯時時跟他的兒子阿昌拌嘴，父子倆總是合不了夥。他一家人六七口子，都靠阿昌在隣近的街上開設的一家小水果店子支持，但市面不好，賺錢有限，日子幾乎是一天在拖過一天地挨着。二喜伯回來之後，便在兒子的店裏帮忙看管，可是他是全然不懂做活，唯知一味喝酒過閒日子而已，對於家的負担，因爲有阿昌在掮着，他根本不想，落得消遙自在了，起初，兒子也曾派他在早上帶了錢上水果行去買些新鮮貨色。但一去，用一個鐘頭可以回來的路程，他往往是打淸到中午才緩吞吞地回來，紅着眼睛，，說話道三不着兩，酒的濃厚的氣味從他口中一陣陣冲出來，自然這一看就明白，原來他是扣了買貨的錢去飮酒，好幾次都是同樣的情形。阿昌不免冒火，他却儘管沒表情地瞧着你，此後阿昌不敢再信任他的老子了，祗好自己跑腿，而另後叫三喜伯看守店子。可是阿昌一出門，三喜伯又有他的了，他偸偸伸手進那雙乘銅子的大竹筒裏抓了一把，藏到口袋裏。另後讓一個不懂事的孫子看守店子，他悄悄地溜出去了。不久阿昌回來，一看光景他馬上心裏雪亮的。然而他只得縐了縐眉。二做了老子，還不知死活，沒法，那麽嘆息着。</p>
<p>這之後，阿昌對於店里的銀錢自不得不管得嚴，他自己不在店的時候便叫女人出來管，使三喜伯要一個鋦子再也不可能。因此三喜伯偶然喝了酒，就藉口大罵起兒子來。</p>

<p>禍害都從分家起</p>
<p>好好的一個農村家庭，擁有很多的田地，弟兄五個（老大王獻齋，老二襲稼農，老三孫敏，老四髙占非，老五趙丹。）正應該分工合作，承繼祖業，挽回這破產的農村，過着愉快與安逸的生活。</p>
<p>但是，他們終於爲着弟兄間的猜疑，妯娌間的嫉妬，把好好的家，分得七零八落。分家，原本不是絕對壞的事，它可以促成各個間的自立與向上的勇氣，可是老大王獻齋同宜覺琳，都是羡慕着都市的生活，分了家他們都搬到上海來，投機失敗，受騙，不但自身嘗到了家破人亡的滋味，終於還連累着老二老三，也都滅亡在都市罪惡的浪潮裏。</p>
<p>「娜拉」在「自由神」里</p>
<p>當王獻齊，襲稼農，孫敏先後傷病垂危在醫院裏。髙占非同趙丹趕來探望的時候，王獻齋在斷續聲裏，訴說着現在的覺醒，悔恨着過去的錯誤，那凄凉悲慘的情緒，充塞着病床的四週，但是追悔也巳經莫及，霎那間，竟一個個相繼着走上死亡的路綫。</p>
<p>最後，髙占非喊出回到農村去的口號，趙丹也願意放棄了他的學業，跟他哥哥去做農村工作。</p>
<p>回到農村去！這是「大家庭」裏髙昂的呼聲，因爲，農村雖然巳經破產，大家擠在經濟崩潰的都會裏，也不是生意經。</p>

<h3 id="c205">荷蘭亞姆斯特丹的建築（上） <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 月祺</p>
<p>亞姆斯特丹在荷蘭是以建築藝術著名的城市之一，同時也是具顯明的對照色彩的一個城市。它有富於歷史興味的紀念物；它又有同樣富於興味的完全現代的及與現代事業有關的建築物。在縱横交叉的河渠內，髹漆着古式顏色的遊艇閒散地駛行着，同時在河岸上則有鬧轟轟的汽車急忙地馳走着。在街上奔走的人們，大抵穿着現代式的衣服，但到處仍然可以碰見服裝和他們的祖先一樣的行人。</p>
<p>和北歐許多重要的城市相同，亞姆斯特丹的主要活動永遠和造船工業和船運事業相關。管理水道，是亞姆斯特丹的最大問題之一。壩閘的建造，與河渠的截斷，使亞姆斯特丹幾乎成爲小島的集團。這些河渠，深不過三呎半，因北海河的灌溉河水得常保新鮮。</p>
<p>在彼此以小河道連接的Grachts的兩邊，有舊時商人和重要市民的房屋。這些高貴的房屋，大抵屬荷蘭式，性質和歐洲各處完全不同。它們的年代，遲早不同，但構造大抵相同。十七世紀早期的房屋與十八世紀以後的房屋互相接隣。這兩種建築物，俱以打木椿入泥地爲基礎，所不同的是早期房屋多用木材，後期房屋多用水泥。</p>
<p>Grachts兩旁的舊時商人的房屋的構造，大抵以木材爲主。木椿打就以後，建造皆就在木椿上面鋪設一座木頭平台，又在平台上面堅起一座木材屋架。屋架築就後，然後鋪砌牆壁·牆壁塗油或柏油，藉以防禦潮濕。因此，亞姆斯特丹的舊式房屋大抵呈幽暗色，幸而用在木料與窗門上面的乳酪色漆與用在門戶上面的綠漆把幽暗的色彩掩益不少。</p>
<p>這些舊式房屋的內部，是頗有趣味的，而且布置都差不多相同。地下室用作廚房及佇藏室。通地下室的門，位在通正屋的階梯底下。正屋的下層用作辦公室，上　用作住它。廟房的地板與牆壁，俱用白雲石舖砌；白雲石在亞姆斯特丹有巨大的銷路。目前，這些舊式房屋，幾全部供商業上的用途，十七世紀早期的房屋則用作堆棧，但這些建築物的構造却仍然影響現代建築的設計。</p>
<p>屋址的拘束與狹隘，使內部設計非常困難。因此造成的結果之一，是步梯峻峭，使笨重的貨物與傢具的搬運幾乎不可能。因此這些房屋都設有起重機，藉以吊運貨物。成爲亞姆斯特丹建築物的特徵之一的起重機，卽使在新建設的住宅區域，也仍然被沿用着；同時，在最近建造的房屋裏面，使這些起重機成爲萬不可缺的峻峭的步梯，也如在舊式房屋內一股存在着。</p>
<p>在新的區域和在舊的區域相同，磚是建造房屋用的普通材料。在荷蘭這是很自然的事，因爲在荷蘭各處有很多良好的磚塲。這些地方的泥土造成各種顏色的磚。荷闌的磗，在尺寸上和其他歐洲各處出產的磚完全不同；英國著名的四吋半磚在荷蘭是找不到的。荷蘭的磚少有厚過二吋四分之一的，有的僅一吋半厚。這些小單位給予荷蘭建築物一種特殊的性質，尤其是當排成雜色的時候。同樣的磚，亦被用以造路。給予人的印象是完全磚造的街道，房屋與馬路用相同的材料。</p>
<p>亞姆斯特丹的新建集物，和舊建築物格局大不相同，但它們却以滿意的方式和舊建築物相調和。一切新建築物，都具有完全由於意識的或無意識的傳統勢力而成的荷蘭風味。維持着瀰漫於亞姆斯特丹的特殊的荷蘭空氣的，正是這傳統勢力的精神。</p>
<p>和大多數歐洲城市相同，亞姆期特丹在十九世紀間也遭受工業主義降臨的命運，其時在建築方面的情形是無差別的和無管理的。建築的發展，不依規則；街道的建造，並無特別的計劃；東部幾處年代久遠和擁擠的區域，幾淪爲陋巷。目前，市政當局已計劃把這些東部區域肅淸，而且已有一部分居民遷至新住宅區去了。亞姆斯特丹的房屋改造計劃，發軔於世界大戰以後，當時的動機是房屋缺乏。市政當局採取隨機會購買土地的政策，以防地價飛漲。亞姆斯特丹的市政改造計劃是非常野心的，但實施計劃的步驟却是很穩健的。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c206">房屋高度的限制 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 徐蒲生</p>
<p>住屋的建築與人類之衛生有極密切重大之關係，而日光的充足與否更居首要的地位。住屋有需充分的陽光，更需直接的陽光。芝加哥市之衛生部長CharlesB．Ball氏嘗謂：室內光綫與空氣如不良好，則生理上必致發生食慾减退，體重减輕，視力薄弱，以及神經衰弱等症。</p>
<p>惟近代以商業資本之發展，與建築材料的進步，如鋼骨混凝土之被利用等，遂致產生了許多高矗的大厦。此等大厦之陰影，使隣近較低的住屋减少直接間接的陽光之照射，以致損害及居住者之健康。而於大厦本身，亦有不利之處，如下層室中之黯黑，卽在日中工作，亦須燃燈；如遭火災，則居於上層者，其危險更不待言。是故各國都市，對於房屋高度，均有限制之法律；其方法大抵以建築物前面之道路的寬度而定。例如英日之規定：</p>
<p>日住宅區—房屋高度不得超過當面街道寬度之一又四分之一倍</p>
<p>其他—房屋高度不得超過當面街道寬度之一又二分之一倍</p>
<p>英住宅區—一倍</p>
<p>其他—一又二分之一倍</p>
<p>如建築時必欲增加高度，則其建築綫必須作適當之退讓；使街道增寬，於比例上依然適合於限制之原則，而該建築與相隣住屋，其下層仍能接受對方屋頂上射下之陽光。惟退讓與增高之比，規定亦不一律；如退讓一呎，其增高之數，少則半呎，多至三四呎，就中以一與一之比爲最普遍。惟若干法律，對此辦法亦有限度；如日本，則住宅區內，房屋最高不得超出六十五呎，其他區域，則以百呎爲限。</p>
<p>上海市對此事項，亦有同樣之規定：</p>
<p>沿公路之建築物，其髙度不得超過該路寬度之一倍半。（卽路之寬度與建築物之髙度爲一與一·五之比）高度逾上項規定時，應將上層建築依一與一·五之比例逐層收進。轉角處之建築物，如兩面沿路門面相等者，其髙度得以較寬之公路爲標準。用木柱載重之舊式房屋，髙度不得超過十一公尺，（或三十六呎）並不得造四層樓。四角用磚牆實砌之房屋，其內部之建築材料，不足以防火者，髙度不得過十八公尺。（或六十呎）建築物之用鋼鐵鋼骨水泥或規定之防火材料構造者，高度不得過二十五公尺。（或八十二呎）建築物之高度，以路面至屋簷爲準。屋面上另有附屬建築物，超過全屋面積十分之二者，則該建築物之高度，應以此項附屬建築物爲進。</p>
<p>建築高矗之大厦，除節省地積外，實無益處；而所耗經費，反又倍蓰。其所以如此者，無非炫燿與衆，以收商業上廣告之效；故此等大厦，多爲百貨商店，而非住宅。旣有損於人民之健康，則爲法律所限制，宜也。</p>
<h3 id="c207">建築史話（四） <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 不忍</p>
<p>可是，雖然這建造的方式似乎差不多恒久適合英國人的背景，但我們現在好像已經走到它的盡頭了。這是由於我們的生活方式近來變換得非常厲害非常急速的緣故。我們現代人，因習慣的新異和發明的豐富，是不適於安居在舊式的房屋或寄托在舊式的背景的。而且，鋼樑和鋼骨水泥的應用，以及一切新物件的方式，都需要新的設計建造，然後可以收獲圓滿的效益。</p>
<p>目前，固然還有少數人依然頗關心於房屋的華麗，但我們大多數對於居屋都要求輕巧，通空氣，利便，合理的廉價，整齊，和通暢。我們不需要任何裝璜或虛飾，都需要供給舒適，利益，與省力的科學能力所及的完全設備。現在，只有很少數的富豪纔愛好而且纔有能力設置舊式的奢華的大厦，大多數人所需要的只是具備「堅固」「合用」與「舒適」三條件的純粹建築。</p>
<p>這當然是指合於多數人居住的簡小而且密接的住宅而言。流行於德國，斯干狄那維亞，和蘇聯的公寓式「層樓』，與紐的摩天樓，就是這新傾向的產物。在有了足够安頓一家的小住宅以後，我們更需要優美寬敞的公共房屋，藉以供給關於大衆的娛樂，敎育和社交等用途。</p>
<p>因爲不滿意舊生活方式的人大多了，他們一定會開始試騐新的生活方式的；到了相當時期，某種合於新生活方式的建築物的產生，是無疑的。（完）</p>
<h3 id="c208">估價種種 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 徐繼堯</p>
<p>估價之目的在於精確，各人儘可創設一種最精確便利之方法而應用之，但欲知如何估計方爲精確以前，必須先知現今世界在通用之法術如何，方能參照而改良之，茲縷述谷種估價法如下：</p>
<p>（甲）容積估計法（CubicfootValues）歐美各國多用此估計者，卽以其建築物之全體體積計算其爲若干立方呎，或若干立方公尺（自底脚起直至屋頂止所有容積）以每立方尺或每立方公尺爲單位價格乘之卽爲該建築物應値若干方能建築，此法關於面積，高低並地脚之深淺大小，屋頂之傾斜，均一律算入，故非常精確，其所難者，爲每立方尺，或立方公尺之單位價格必須精確而與實際無髙低之差爲難事耳。</p>
<p>凡用此種估計之各國，其雜誌中均載有正在建造中各工程之單位價格（卽每立方尺建築費若干）使各關係人均知各種建築之價値而便於比較與估計其他將造之各工種價値（例如今有一工程其程度！等級，應與已造成之某工程類似，則其價格亦應相近，故可依據其單位價格而作估價之根據以計算之，若略有不同或有運送等遠近情形不同時，則亦可將單位增减若干，而估計之。）</p>
<p>（乙）面積估計法（PerSquarefootoflloorSpace）用建築物之面積爲估計之單位法，亦盛行於歐西各國，今吾國亦有應用此法者，若所用單位價格非適當之數額時。易招極大差異，故京滬一帶用此法計估者謂之大賬，卽爲大概情形之賬，僅可作爲速成之估計法而非精密之估計者，故投標開賬等均須另開細賬方能有根據而不致損益過當也。</p>
<p>此種作法僅以地板面積爲標準，不問屋之髙低及底脚之深淺，屋頂之傾斜等等，故决非精確之估計，但因其迅速而易使人明白用於工程師與業主之預算，則非常相宜，因工程師之預算本無損益關係，業主則須承包人投送標單方能决定其造價，工程師之預算僅可用作參考也。今京滬一帶用此法估計者以地板面一英方爲單位，卽每一百平方英尺爲一方，例如某建築除陽台踏步平台等零星工事面積不能算入外，有地板面積若干方，每方若干元則此建築物之工程費等於單位價格乘方數是也。</p>
<p>（丙）工料逐項精估法TheOuantitySystemofEstimating此種估價最爲精密，卽就圖樣說明書將建築物中之各種工程分開計算其體積或數量再參酌說明之做法估定其單位工程價格，逐項求出其價格後，再積成總工程費，故非常準確也。但此種估價以前，須將該建築之圖樣反覆看淸而詳記其構造，再參觀說明書，務須明瞭一切方可逐項估算，否則遺漏必多，易招錯誤而致賠累，則欲精密而反易錯誤矣。作此種佔價最易遺漏或重覆分別一一估算之，往往錯誤，或遺忘，欲免此弊，亦可使二人各作估價一紙而對照校正之。滬寗一帶，開細賬之法均用此法，吾等由此賬中可明瞭包工人所開細賬，是否算得精確，單價是否適當，幷可以知包工人是否明瞭圖樣及說明書中一切規定之方式，卽此種估法非將圖樣看懂，說明書看過，不能開列符合之數量及單價故也。一般細賬是將建築內各工事各二分開，例如底脚三和土若干，每方若干元，大方脚若干，每方若干元，二十寸墻十五寸墻，十寸墻亦各二分開列成數量而估計之，可如大門一堂，雙扇門幾堂，單扇門幾堂，小門幾堂，分別記開而一一估算之，故此種估價費時至多，往往盡一日之光陰猶不能算完一估單者。</p>
<p>綜合以上三種方法爲現今最普通而實用者，但我國舊式之估價則更精密無比，因其估算法是算出木材根數，磚料塊數，瓦片若干，石灰若干担，紙筋若干斤，木匠若干人，若干工，小工若干名等數目，詳細開列甚精，惟其結果亦　於符合者，故往往超出預算至鉅，或估算太精密反易肇錯誤，則反不如以上三種之估計爲妥當矣。</p>

<p>(Nanjing) President Wang went to the Executive Yuan office at 10:45 AM. Senior officials such as the secretaries and counselors of the Yuan paid their respects in order. He then met with Minister Chen Gongbo, Mayor of Nanjing Ma Chaojun, and the newly appointed Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Shaanxi, Peng Zhaoxian. As they were about to take office, they also visited the Yuan at 11:00 AM to pay their respects and seek instructions. Wang met with them and gave many instructions. (Special dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to Chu Minyi, although President Wang's apparent illness has improved, the underlying condition has not been eliminated. If he overworks again, there is a high possibility of recurrence. Therefore, it is necessary to stipulate rest periods and reduce less important affairs in the future so that his health can be recuperated without affecting important national policies. (Special dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After President Wang telegraphed his return to duty, he has been meeting with the heads of various ministries and commissions and senior officials of the Yuan for days, inquiring about political affairs. He officially went to the Yuan at 10:00 AM on the 26th to attend to his duties and approve official documents. He also met with Peng Zhaoxian, Ma Chaojun, Chen Gongbo, and senior officials of the Yuan one after another. He returned to his residence for rest at 12:00 PM. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Kemin, Acting Chairman of the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Readjustment Committee in Peiping, arrived in Nanjing at 8:00 AM on the 26th. Wang's wife, eldest and second daughters, secretaries, and more than ten staff members came south with him. The National Government sent Fu Xuanqing, and the Executive Yuan sent Huang Qiuyue, to greet him across the river. After getting off the train, he went to the residence of Wu Zhenxiu, manager of the Bank of China, to rest. At 9:00 AM, he accompanied Huang to the No. 1 official residence of the Ministry of Railways to meet President Wang, report on the political situation in North China, and ask for instructions on everything. They talked for half an hour before he departed. At 2:30 PM, Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin personally visited Wang at Wu's residence and talked for two hours. At 5:00 PM, Wang visited President Wang again. That evening, Wang hosted a banquet to welcome Wang, and invited He Yingqin, Tang Youren, Chen Shuren, and Chen Gongbo to accompany him. Wang said that he came at Wang's telegram summon to discuss political affairs in North China, and planned to stay for two or three days before going to Mogan Mountain to meet Chairman Huang and report on the affairs of the Political Affairs Readjustment Committee. He would return to Peiping in a week. The Committee's political affairs meeting, originally scheduled for the 29th, was temporarily postponed due to his arrival in Nanjing. It would be rescheduled after his return to Peiping in early next month. The current situation in North China and the war zone is very quiet. Tao Shangming has been restored to freedom and is now said to have gone to Tangshan. The murderer in the Liu Zuozhou case has been caught and is being interrogated. The train robbery case on the Beining Railway was caused by bandits coveting wealth and measures have been taken to prevent it. The case of Koreans trafficking in silver is being handled by the Beining Railway Bureau, which is strictly investigating and arresting them. A reporter asked Wang whether the so-called special service organizations organized by Japan in the four provinces of Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Shanxi had been agreed to by us. Wang replied that the old name for these special service organizations was military liaison officers. The one in Chahar, headed by Matsui, was established long ago. The rest were established through contact with local military and political officials, not through seeking the consent of the Political Affairs Readjustment Committee as a whole. (Special dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Kemin visited He Yingqin and other friends in Nanjing on the morning of the 26th. He returned the visit in the afternoon, and they talked for a long time. Wang visited President Wang again at 5:00 PM, and they discussed matters before he departed at 6:00 PM. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) During the Executive Yuan's memorial week at 10:00 AM on the 26th, President Wang originally intended to attend in person to give a report, but because Wang Kemin arrived in Nanjing and visited his official residence for a long talk, Chu Minyi was temporarily assigned to give the report, which stated that although Wang's illness had slightly improved, the underlying condition had not been eliminated. If he overworked, his gallbladder could still become inflamed at any time, endangering his health. In late June, Wang fell ill due to a long speech. In the future, Wang should not give speeches unless absolutely necessary, and officials from various ministries and commissions and staff within the Yuan should also refrain from personally requesting instructions unless it concerns major national affairs. In addition, Wang has stipulated that from Monday to Saturday, except for the mornings of Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays when he must attend meetings, 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM in the morning and 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM in the afternoon will be designated as office hours, so that he can conserve his energy, recuperate his health, and focus on handling important political affairs.

<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government and the National Government have decided to jointly hold a commemoration of Confucius' birthday at the Central Auditorium on the morning of the 27th. Ye Chucang will preside over the report. The Central Secretariat and the National Government's Bureau of Civil Affairs have separately notified all personnel to participate and have granted a one-day holiday for commemoration. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The Peiping Municipal Government has been actively preparing in advance for the commemoration of Confucius' birthday on the 27th. A commemoration ceremony will be held at the Confucius Temple in the Imperial College at 10:00 AM on the 27th. Yuan Liangjiang will personally preside over the ceremony. Various agencies, schools, and organizations will send representatives to participate. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 26th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government and the National Government jointly held the 197th Memorial Week at the Central Auditorium at 8:00 AM on the 26th. Central Committee members Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Ma Chaojun, Dai Chuanxian, Zhu Jiahua, Li Zonghuang, Ji Liang, and heads of various bureaus and departments of the National Government, Wei Huai, Chen Qicai, Wen Yiyou, Zhu Wenzhong, Gao Lingbai, Tian Shijie, and staff members of the Party Headquarters, totaling about 600 people, attended. Ju Zheng presided over the meeting, and Dai Chuanxian delivered a report, stating that the severity of the national crisis and natural disasters facing our country is no less than that in the 20th year of the Republic of China. However, due to the current economic difficulties and the depression of all industries, all forces, whether in society or in the country, are far less adequate and profound than they were in those years. The current international situation is becoming increasingly serious, and the time for drawing swords and stringing bows has arrived. To seek survival, the entire nation must be united. Our people should not be pessimistic. We must know that the future of our nation, the future of our country, and even the future of our Party, have unlimited prospects, waiting for our generation to strive forward. The so-called "adversity builds a nation" is precisely the time for it. From the beginning of the Republic of China to the present, in the past 24 years, our country has made significant progress in all aspects, but the speed of progress is still inferior to others. Therefore, we cannot completely dismiss progress and be pessimistic and discouraged. People across the country should work together and fully utilize their intelligence to seek the survival of the country and the nation. Dai finished his speech and the meeting adjourned at 9:30 AM.

<p>(Qingjiangpu) Xu Dingkang, the flood prevention director, levied 10,000 laborers in Pi County to build the Bulaohe embankment, and telegraphed Commissioner Wang of the Huaiyin District, requesting him to order County Magistrates Zhang Naifan and He Changrong of Suqian and Siyang Counties to each levy 5,000 laborers to assist. (Special dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Shao Hanyuan, seeing that the water situation in Tongbei was increasingly tense, went to the seventh section this afternoon with engineer Yu Shufang to inspect the set embankment, guide the reinforcement, and supervise the laborers to strictly guard. He will also go to Fengpei to inspect the west embankment of Weishan Lake to ensure consistent and strict prevention. It has been found that the west embankment of Weishan Lake only has 60 meters of breaches at Zhang Gushan and Daihai, which have been reinforced with set embankments. The area east of the main embankment and the set embankment is completely submerged, while the area west of the embankment relies on the embankment as a barrier and is being strictly guarded without relaxation. The people of Xuzhou absolutely do not believe that the Yellow River can change its course. Once the breach in western Shandong is blocked, the water situation will naturally decrease. (Special dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) According to the Flood Prevention Office, the water level of Weishan Lake rose by 7 centimeters today, reaching 36.487 meters, 1 centimeter less than the high water level in the 15th year of the Republic of China. (Special dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) Chen Guofu said that the Yellow River is overflowing. The fields, livestock, and crops in Tongfengpei rely heavily on the west embankment of Weishan Lake for protection. Officials and civilians in Jiangsu Province are working together to fight the water. Rumors that he expressed a negative attitude due to the flood are unfounded. (Special dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) According to the Jinpu Railway, the water situation in Maocun continues to rise, and the Dashanhe River along the river is overflowing. Four kilometers of the roadbed in that section are submerged in water. The railway is transporting seven trains of stone slabs from Fuliji to Maocun to pile along the roadbed to prevent impact. According to engineer Zhu Xianhui, the water level in Maocun is lower than that in Hanzhuang, and the water situation is the most severe along the river. The Yanhe bridge is 600 feet long, the Dashanhe bridge is 400 feet long, and the canal bridge is only 150 feet long, but the Yanhe bridge is 4.1 meters lower than the canal bridge, making Maocun relatively dangerous. (Special dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Tongfang Yellow River Association held a standing committee meeting this afternoon. As the air of the Yellow River changing its course has been very thick, the key lies in whether the breach in western Shandong can be blocked. It was decided to: 1. Telegraph various counties in western Shandong, requesting them to unanimously demand the blocking of the breach to avoid the Yellow River disaster. 2. Jointly with the Donghai and Huaiyin areas, unanimously demand the central government to quickly block the breach in western Shandong. 3. Supervise the laborers to strictly guard the embankments and live and die together. 4. Request the Relief Association to appeal to all parties for relief to the disaster victims. (Special dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) A telegram from Pi County reported that the seepage and overflow on the north bank of the Bulaohe River has flooded a vast area west of the Taizhao Road. Workers are currently being supervised to block the culverts of the Taizhao Road to prevent the water from inundating the land west of the road. Since the river water flooded north, it has dropped by 11 centimeters, but the disaster area is slightly larger. (Special dispatch from the 26th)</p>

<h3 id="e20">The American Neutrality Act <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>The American Neutrality Act has been passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives and sent to Roosevelt for his signature. The legislative procedures will soon be completed. This bill, when first introduced in the Senate, originally prohibited the export of munitions to belligerent nations. It also prohibited Americans from traveling on ships of belligerent nations and forbade warships of belligerent nations from entering American ports. Therefore, its nature was akin to absolute neutrality, showing no bias towards either side of the belligerent nations. However, when this bill was transferred to the House of Representatives, the House amended it, stipulating that the decision to prohibit the export of munitions to one side or both sides would be made at the discretion of the President. It is said that Roosevelt intends for the prohibition of munitions exports to be directed towards aggressor nations, and not to treat aggressors and those being aggressed upon equally. The House's amendment satisfies Roosevelt, to say the least. At the same time, this neutrality act also sets a limit on the duration of neutrality, namely, February 29, 1936, after which it becomes invalid. Therefore, although this amendment seems similar to the one previously introduced in the Senate, its implications are significant. The former neutrality is the so-called neutrality before the Great War, while the latter neutrality is qualitatively different.</p>
<p>Before the Great War, all neutral nations were obliged to maintain an impartial and unbiased attitude towards belligerent nations, treating both sides equally, without showing any favor. Therefore, they could neither assist Party A nor harm Party B. For example, if munitions were embargoed, it had to be done equally to both sides. This impartial attitude was based on the concept of unclear boundaries between aggressor and victim. In other words, right and wrong between nations were determined by each nation itself, and others were not allowed to interfere. Therefore, when international disputes could not be resolved through diplomatic channels, both sides resorted to war, and those on the sidelines regarded it as a matter of each having their own reasons. Apart from the parties concerned seeking their own solutions, there was no need to judge right or wrong. Furthermore, there was no need to identify one party as the aggressor and the other as the victim. Therefore, one either did not remain neutral, or if one chose to remain neutral, one had to help neither side and harm neither side. The original Neutrality Act passed by the US Senate was of this nature. However, since the Great War, with the establishment of the League of Nations and the signing of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, whether there was still a need to maintain this impartial concept of neutrality has become a major question. The Covenant of the League of Nations clearly stipulates sanctions against nations that violate the Covenant, which confirms that there is a distinction between right and wrong between belligerent nations, and that those who are right should be assisted and those who are wrong should be punished. No nation is allowed to adopt the past attitude of neutrality. Although the United States is not a member state, the Kellogg-Briand Pact did require signatory nations to renounce the use of force as an instrument of national policy. In other words, if a nation violates the treaty and still uses force as an instrument of national policy, it is clearly a militarist nation. Although the treaty does not explicitly stipulate sanctions against militarist nations, it should at least not be equated with nations that are not militarist and are merely acting in self-defense, treating them equally. Therefore, according to the spirit of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, even if the United States wants to maintain impartial neutrality, it is unable to do so. The House of Representatives' amendment, which grants the President the power to act at his discretion and shortens the period of neutrality, can be said to take into account the spirit of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. It cannot be compared with the US Senate's original bill, which merely sought to avoid the vortex of European war without regard for right or wrong.</p>

<p>(Washington) The 1934 Yearbook of World Economics by the U.S. Department of Commerce was published today. It assesses the economic situation in China, formally expressing its opinions, stating that overall, the trend seems to be mostly positive. Although the decrease in silver reserves in banks poses a threat to China's modern credit system, and the business community anticipates that the impact of the global economic recession will become more severe for China, the following three points are sufficient to indicate progress in the situation: (1) The domestic political situation is very stable, arguably the most stable period since the founding of the Republic of China; (2) The Communist Party and other disturbances are confined to a part of the Yangtze River basin; (3) The overall relationship between China and Japan has improved after several years of unease. Although these are all administrative matters, the economic benefits derived from them are undeniable. By the end of the year, public sentiment had stabilized somewhat, but the expansion of debt seems to have begun. China's total silver reserves are around two billion ounces, and even if there is some outflow, it would not be a major issue. However, these silver reserves are dispersed among the people and not controlled by the central government. The foundation of China's current credit system relies solely on the silver accumulated in Shanghai in recent years. If bank reserves decrease, there is a risk of collapse. Therefore, China's problem of dealing with rising silver prices remains difficult to solve. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>

At that time, Wang was the regimental commander, and Liu Zuo-zhou was the battalion commander in Wang's regiment, with Li serving as the company commander in Liu's battalion. Later, Wang Tieshiang resigned for some reason, and Liu took over as acting regimental commander. Soon after, Liu dismissed Li, causing Li to lose his job. As a result, Li harbored deep hatred for Liu and always thought of ways to retaliate, but he had no opportunity to do so. Recently, Liu was appointed commander of the Third Special Police Regiment of the war zone, and Li again asked someone to speak to Liu, requesting to be re-employed, but Liu refused again. Therefore, Li's determination to kill Liu became even stronger. On the fourth of this month, Liu accompanied Yin Rugeng, the commissioner of the Aoyu District, to Yuguan for inspection. Li learned about this in advance and knew that Liu would return to Luan County that afternoon. So he waited at the station, looking for an opportunity to act. When the train arrived at Luan County station, Liu got off the train. Because there were many guards surrounding him, Li did not have a chance to shoot. Li then followed Liu on foot out of the station. When he reached the station entrance, Liu was talking to a Japanese officer, and the guards stood behind Liu. At this time, Li saw an opportunity and quickly fired a shot at Liu's head, killing him instantly. After Li fired the shot, Liu's guards also returned fire. In a state of panic, Li fired another shot at Liu's head, and Liu immediately fell to the ground. At this time, Kitamura, a Japanese military police officer at the station, also rushed forward. Li, in the confusion, ran away, fearing Kitamura would stop him. He then fired a shot at Kitamura's hand holding the gun. In a hurry, he fled out of the station. At the same time, fearing pursuit, he threw a hand grenade as he left the station, accidentally injuring his own foot, leaving bloodstains on the ground, providing a clue for the detectives. This killing was purely revenge for a private feud and had no other reasons. After Yin finished interrogating Li, he reported the details of the interrogation and Li's entire confession to the Political Readjustment Committee and the Hebei Provincial Government. Yin himself will return to Ping from Tangshan tomorrow to meet with Shang Zhen and report everything. (Special Telegram, 26th)</p>

<h3 id="e29">The U.S. Protests to Russia That the Third International Is Interfering in Internal Affairs, Violating the Soviet-American Agreement, Strong Language Threatens Severance of Relations <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) The U.S. Ambassador to Russia, Bullitt, lodged today with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the most forceful protest in recent U.S.-Russian diplomatic history, threatening to break off diplomatic relations between the two countries. The protest letter asserts that recent speeches and resolutions of the Third International threaten to have serious consequences, as the actions of the Third International are clearly interfering in the internal affairs of the United States, in clear violation of the Soviet agreement to renounce propaganda in the United States. It further states that when the Soviet government is unwilling or unable to take appropriate measures to stop such actions that violate sacred promises, the most serious consequences will inevitably arise. It also states that what the American people deeply abhor is foreign interference in American internal affairs. The U.S. government believes that maintaining friendly relations between the U.S. and Russia depends on the Soviet Union strictly fulfilling its promise not to interfere in American internal affairs. It is regrettable that at a time when the international environment requires the continuation of U.S.-Russian relations, actions that violate previous promises and interfere in American internal affairs are occurring within Soviet Russia. At the current meeting of the Third International in Russia, American Communist presidential candidate Foster, American Communist Party Secretary-General Kraut, and San Francisco labor leader Darcy have boasted of their power to overthrow the American political and social system. It seems that the Soviet government cannot ignore these statements and activities. However, the Soviet response and specific measures are still unknown. However, according to U.S. officials, the Soviet Union will likely deny responsibility for the actions of the Third International, claiming the Soviet government is not responsible. (National Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Washington) U.S. Secretary of State Hull instructed the U.S. Ambassador to Russia to deliver the protest to the Soviet government. Experts in diplomatic affairs here and congressional leaders believe that the U.S. is about to revoke its recognition of Russia. Chairman McLean of the House Foreign Affairs Committee stated that his opinion is completely consistent with that of the State Department. Senator Hughes of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee stated that the U.S. protest merely wants the Soviet Union to fulfill its promises. Pro-recognition progressive Republican Senator Borah stated that he was unwilling to express his opinion until he had thoroughly studied the issue. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Foreign news agencies report that the U.S. government has lodged a serious protest with the Soviet government because the Soviet Union violated the Soviet-American Convention by promoting communism at the Seventh Congress of the Communist Party in Moscow. According to Ambassador Ota's report to the Foreign Ministry from Russia, the proceedings of the congress were generally as follows: On August 1, it was resolved that the Communist Party should cooperate with the international proletariat and workers, and Japanese Communist Party members Okano (real name Nosaka Sanzo) and Tanaka (real name Yamamoto Kenzo) were to broadcast speeches by radio. The Japanese government, because the Soviet Union trampled on the spirit of goodwill, damaged Japanese feelings, and carried out red activities against Japan, plans to lodge a protest with the Soviet government and is currently preparing.

<p>(London) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, in an interview with Daily Mail special correspondent Price, said: "Regarding the Abyssinian issue, Italy will not back down. If the Italian government changes its attitude, the 200,000 Italian troops currently stationed in East Africa will act on their own, and the government will not be able to stop them. If the League of Nations decides to impose sanctions on Italy, Italy will immediately withdraw from the League of Nations. Know that no matter who wants to impose sanctions on Italy, the entire Italian people are ready to use force to oppose them. If the League of Nations handles the matter carelessly and wants to turn Italy's colonial war into a European conflict, causing all ambitious countries in Europe and the world to be greedy and have designs on others, then the cost will be more than the lives of millions of people, and tens of millions of people will be reduced to insects and sand. Then the responsibility for this should be borne solely by the League of Nations. When the Council of the League of Nations meets on September 4th, I will send a delegation to attend, with the intention of clearly expressing Italy's position to the world. I will use documents and photos as supporting evidence for Italy's claims, and I will send a box of books to Geneva to reveal the customs of the savage Abyssinian people and the prevailing slave system in that country. After the League of Nations has carefully examined these documents, we will wait and see whether our country will still be treated the same as Abyssinia." Mussolini also said that Italy is willing to cooperate with all countries, as evidenced by the signing of the Locarno Treaty in 1924 and the formation of the Anglo-French-Italian joint front at the Stresa Conference this year. Italy assisted the British Empire during the war and when the whole world united against it. This must be solemnly declared. Price then asked Mussolini if there was any possibility of Italy changing its attitude. Mussolini replied no. Price asked again whether the Rome Agreement concluded between Italy and France on January 7th, which resolved the outstanding issues between the two countries, included a clause stating that France allowed Italy to have favorable treatment in East Africa. Is this true? The Italian Prime Minister replied, "The Rome Agreement resolved all the disputes between our country and France. That is true." In addition, the Italian Prime Minister believes that the time has come to discuss the entire colonial issue, saying that if Abyssinia can be opened up for colonial business, Italy's wishes can be satisfied.

<p>(Rome) While Mussolini conducts a large-scale exercise with 500,000 troops in northern Italy to respond to the hopes of European peace negotiators, he issued another order today to send 7,000 troops from the port of Naples to East Africa. According to estimates here, Italy's military expenditure on Africa amounts to 5 million to 10 million lire per day. (National Society Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Recently, Italian public opinion no longer feels interested in the diplomatic progress of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. News such as the failure of the Paris Tripartite Conference, the passage of the Neutrality Act by the U.S. Congress, and the situation of the British cabinet meeting have all been received here with indifference. All attention is focused on rapidly completing military preparations. Regarding aviation facilities, the air traffic between Italy and East Africa is becoming more convenient. In January of this year, there were only thirteen airfields in the Italian territory of Eritrea. Now, the number has increased to fifteen. The Asmara-to-Keren air route has two round trips per week. Each flight carries 150 kilograms of mail and five passengers. It takes only three days to reach Asmara from Rome, which is quite convenient. Furthermore, the number of people enlisting in the army in Italy has not decreased. All members of the Turin Fascist Party branch and the leaders of other branches have been incorporated into the army. Veterans in places such as Pola, Trieste, and Genoa are also eager to join the army, which shows the enthusiasm of the people. According to reports, the Kingdom of Yemen in the Arabian Peninsula has decided to remain neutral in the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. This news has had a profound impact on public opinion. The Abyssinian government sent representatives to Yemen two years ago to establish friendly relations in order to strengthen the friendship between the two countries. Yemen's current decision to remain neutral shows that Abyssinia's plans have not been effective. (Havas, 26th)</p>

<p>(London) The British-Indian liner "Neuralia" suddenly received instructions from the British War Office to prepare immediately to carry 1,200 soldiers to Malta by Saturday of this week.

<p>(London) There is great concern here that approximately one thousand army personnel will be dispatched to Malta in the Mediterranean Sea and Aden in Africa this week. This move is clearly related to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. It is intended to strengthen the garrisons in these places so that they can protect the Mediterranean bases in the event of an incident. The War Office recently explained the reason for this move, saying that strengthening the forces in Malta and Aden had already been decided last year. This is just a rehash of the old plan. Moreover, about one hundred of the soldiers sent are carrying their families. If there is a danger in the above-mentioned two places, it would be impossible for the soldiers to bring their families. Malta currently has a garrison of 33,000 troops, and Aden has a force of only about 250 troops. In addition, a certain incident has caused rumors, that is, the aircraft carrier "Glorious," originally stationed in the Atlantic Fleet, has sailed towards Malta. This was unexpected by the general public. The "Furious" of the Mediterranean Fleet has reportedly returned to its home country via the Straits of Gibraltar. People have also paid attention to this. In fact, this transfer is only a troop rotation. The "Glorious" will join the "Revenge" and several other warships anchored in Alexandria, Egypt, at the end of this week to participate in Mediterranean Fleet exercises. Therefore, the transfer of ships is not surprising. (Havas Telegram, 26th)</p>

One member told reporters that the statement of the Italian soldiers completely changed the view of the Walwal incident and was worthy of attention. The Abyssinians did not call witnesses, but it is still difficult to determine who the aggressor is. It is unlikely that the Italian and Abyssinian conciliators will reach a compromise, so it will be necessary to invite the fifth conciliator, the Greek Ambassador to France, Politis, in the next few days. The members left here for Paris yesterday, where they will continue their work. They hope to reach a decision before the League of Nations meets next week. (National Telegram, 26th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) League of Nations officials believe that it will be difficult to make progress in diplomatic negotiations regarding the Italian-Abyssinian dispute before the 88th session of the Council of the League of Nations on September 4.

The President of this session will be Argentinian representative Genacio, who will preside over the opening ceremony. The agenda includes a total of 25 issues, including the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. As for the League of Nations General Assembly, it is scheduled to open on September 9, and the Council meeting will be extended until after the General Assembly closes. Therefore, the General Assembly agenda does not include the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. The main proposals include (1) the issue of contracting states taking measures against foreign political prisoners within their own borders; (2) the general economic situation, which includes the proposal to abolish commercial and monetary controls put forward by former French Minister of Commerce Maurin last September. At that time, the general economic situation report and the French proposal may become the basis for discussion at the General Assembly. (Havas Telegram, 26th)</p>

The meeting concluded at noon, followed by a luncheon and adjourned at 1:00 PM. (Domei News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Army Ministry announced the military purification policy instructed by Army Minister Hayashi at today's division commander meeting, the contents of which are as follows: The current situation is serious, with many internal and external affairs. It is an increasingly urgent time for national unity and the revitalization of military discipline. Suddenly, an ominous incident, unprecedented in the history of the Imperial Army, occurred within the military, causing unspeakable fear. Considering the glorious history of the Imperial Army, regardless of the cause, it is a matter of deep regret. This is due to my own lack of virtue, and my responsibility is undoubtedly great. I am confident that with the efforts of all commanders, the entire army will not be shaken by this incident. However, in light of the impact of the current situation and the incident, I am determined to quickly complete the purification of military discipline and the strengthening of unity, to advance towards the goal with unified efforts from top to bottom. Therefore, I have convened this meeting. The life of the military is based on the strong unity of a consistently controlled network. All officers of the Imperial Army must thoroughly understand the essence of military construction, clearly recognize the truth of the Emperor's command of the military with the concept of the Emperor personally leading the troops, and ensure that all actions adhere to the consistent system of command. Officers must be cautious in their words and actions, make contact with their subordinates, and ensure the authority of the military. At the same time, it is essential to strictly protect military secrets. Furthermore, it is necessary to discern the truth from falsehood in rumors and gossip and severely crack down on their dissemination. Those who lead subordinates should guide their subordinates with love and enthusiasm, teaching and nurturing them. If there is no sign of repentance, they should be dealt with decisively. Furthermore, subordinates should always respect their superiors, accept their teachings, and not disrupt the order by publicizing their own beliefs. In short, the current situation is serious, and it is essential to thoroughly understand the consciousness of the Imperial Army, to rely on and trust each other from top to bottom, and to complete the practice with the unity of the entire nation, in accordance with the Emperor's will. (Domei News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Because Army Minister Hayashi's instructions were chosen with the best possible words, the internal circles expressed their approval. However, the problem lies in how to fully realize each point of these instructions. The Army Minister did not exhaust his abilities with a single instruction. He has made a significant determination to devise good measures for the future. Therefore, how the Army Minister will handle various important issues from now on and achieve the ideal of military purification is attracting great attention from the general public. (Domei News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>Army Minister Hayashi feels deeply responsible for the occurrence of the Nagata Incident and is working hard to implement measures to rectify military discipline and control the military. He convened a division commander meeting on the 25th and held a meeting of directors of directly affiliated government agencies and school principals on the 26th, delivering important instructions. However, it will take three to four weeks for these instructions to thoroughly reach the entire army. The Army Minister will clarify his responsibility and decide on his course of action after this matter has come to a conclusion. (Domei News Agency, 26th)</p>

<p>Hayama: The first meeting of the Ministry of Finance to determine the outline of the general accounting budget for the next year was held in Hayama today. During the meeting, Budget Bureau Director-General Kaya stated that the new budget requests from various ministries had reached 859 million yuan. If the 300 million yuan reserved by the various ministries is added, the total reaches 1.159 billion yuan. After calculation and consolidation, the revised standard budget is 1.661 billion yuan. Combined with the aforementioned new requests, the total budget for the next year actually reaches a huge sum of 2.82 billion yuan. On the revenue side, even with the inclusion of natural revenue increases, ordinary revenue will only be in the range of 1.4 billion to 1.5 billion yuan. Comparing income and expenditure, the shortfall will inevitably be the same as last year, and it will be necessary to issue public bonds. Therefore, the fiscal authorities, while adhering to the principle of gradually reducing deficit bonds, are actually in a position where they cannot avoid strictly limiting new requests and are hoping for the support of Finance Minister Takahashi. Next, the Director-General of the Tax Bureau and the Director-General of the Finance Bureau reported and explained on the situation of tax revenue, the projected situation of natural revenue increases, and public bond policies. After lunch, the meeting resumed. (Domei News Agency, 26th)</p>

<h3 id="e45">Japan Submits Annual Report to League of Nations on Mandated Islands, Denying Establishment of Military Bases <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) Japan has today submitted its annual report to the League of Nations on the mandated Pacific islands, in which it denied establishing naval or military bases there and provided detailed accounts of port construction expenses in order to dispel various rumors from abroad. (Kokumin News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The annual administrative report on the Pacific islands under Japanese mandate, namely the Mariana Islands, the Caroline Islands, and the Marshall Islands, has been submitted by Japan to the League of Nations. The report stated that the country's expenditures for developing the industries and general economy of these islands are less than 1 million yen, and that none of these funds were used for military installations. The League of Nations Mandates Commission believes that Japan has built naval and air bases on these islands, turning them into fortresses, and therefore Japan has violated its mandate. The Commission considers the annual report submitted by Japanese representative Marquis Ito to be unreliable and will request that the representative provide more detailed information.

According to research to date, it is not directly transmitted between people, but is transmitted to humans by extremely small red mosquitoes. These mosquitoes hide in people's homes day and night. Methods to study the source of the disease and prevent it can be researched during the day. The most important thing is to take care to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes.

<p>Taipei: Due to the increasing pressure of life and other unfortunate events, the number of people suffering from mental illness in Taiwan is increasing year by year. Currently, there are a total of six mental hospitals in Taiwan, including Yangshen Yuan, Yanghao Tang, Renji Yuan, Aiai Liao, Aihu Society in Tainan, and Kaohsiung Tzu Hui Society, both public and private. According to the survey statistics at the end of May this year, there are 303 people under confinement, 454 people who have been under confinement, 421 people requiring monitoring, and a total of 3,313 other patients. However, if a more thorough investigation is conducted, the number could be nearly double that. The supervision of mental patients in Taiwan's mental hospitals currently has no legal basis. Only their close relatives can have them admitted. Malignant mental patients cannot be forcibly admitted, which is extremely inconvenient. Therefore, the Governor-General's Health Department has been studying the implementation of the Mental Hospital Law and the Mental Patient Supervision Law, which are currently under vigorous study. This time, the two laws implemented in mainland Japan at the end of March of the eighth year of Taisho will be used as the basis. The draft has already been completed and is currently under review by the Legal Bureau. It will be implemented soon, with the aim of preventing disturbances to order through passive methods.

<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Earlier this month, Mr. Funatsu Ten'ichirō, the managing director of the Japan Cotton Spinners' Association in China, came to Tianjin from Shanghai to conduct a detailed survey of the cotton spinning industry in North China. He returned to Japan last week. After arriving in Tokyo, Funatsu gave a speech stating that it was not yet the right time for Japanese investment in the North China cotton spinning industry. However, the reality is quite the opposite of what he said. After Funatsu left, he entrusted the Tōtaku K.K., the Daifuku Company, and Itō, the director of the Jin Yu Da Cotton Mill, to provide loans, intending to use loans to acquire the stock rights of various cotton mills as a step towards future manipulation. The so-called North China cotton mills, with the exception of the Tangshan Hua Xin Cotton Mill, are all located in Tianjin. Therefore, it is more accurate to call them the Tianjin cotton industry. Traditionally, there have been six mills in total. Currently, only Hua Xin, (Tianjin Mill) Doucheng, and Yudai are operating. The others, such as Yu Yuan, Beiyang, and Hengyuan, have all suspended operations. Yu Da was originally operated by Chinese, but due to debts owed to the Japanese, it has become a creditor-controlled enterprise, practically equivalent to a Japanese-owned mill. Therefore, of the six cotton mills in Tianjin, only two are still managed by Chinese, with the others either bankrupt or under Japanese management. Due to the dumping of Japanese yarn, business has been difficult for a long time. Although Yu Yuan, Heng Yuan, and Bei Yang intend to resume operations, due to financial constraints, preparations have been ongoing for almost a year without a definite date. Only Hengyuan has a rumor that people will be sent by the creditor Central Bank and other banks to manage the resumption of work, but when this will be realized is also unknown. The Japanese side recognizes this as an opportunity, hence the visit of Funatsu Ten'ichirō to conduct inspections and the activities of Daifuku and Tōtaku. It is faintly heard that considerable success has already been achieved, and soon one or two cotton mills may be resurrected under the guise of Japanese guidance.</p>
<p>Within the past week, Nakane, the Japanese consul stationed in Chengde, Rehe, along with Yamagishi Sadaichi, the chief of the civil engineering section of the puppet Chengde public office, advisor Chiba, and seven attendants, inspected the Luan River downstream to the Tonghe at the river mouth. Afterwards, Yamagishi, Nakane, Chiba, and others came to Tianjin to meet with Kawa Shigeru, the Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin, and members of the garrison military department. On the 23rd, they returned to Chengde to report. The purpose of the inspection was to dredge the Luan River to make it directly accessible to the sea, so as to serve as an outlet for Rehe and a channel for economic communication between southern Rehe and northern Hebei. Traditionally, the products of Rehe Province are transported by land, which is quite inconvenient. Moreover, the need for materials and local products cannot be severed with Hebei Province, so this plan has been formulated, with the expectation of certain success. The results of Yamagishi and others' inspection are quite satisfactory, and their forecast may be implemented soon. (24th)</p>

Hengtang to Shihou Shangfang Mountain are all under design and construction.

At 11:00 AM, County Magistrate Wu Qiyun held the ribbon-cutting ceremony. The Suzhou-Fukong Company's cars carrying guests then drove forward. The journey was smooth. The company also hosted tea and refreshments at the Shi Jia Hotel, followed by a tour of Lingyan Mountain. Many private cars also participated in the tour of Lingyan Mountain. When departing, one car belonging to painter Wu Silan overturned in a field at the No. 1 bridge due to excessive speed, and his wife was slightly injured.</p>

<p>Yu Gui, a woman from Sizhangwan outside the South Gate, is the daughter of Yu Binggen, who works in aquatic products at No. 135 there. She married Sheng Shou as an adopted son-in-law in the East Gate. They have been married for many years and have had two children. Recently, Yu Gui became pregnant again. After only seven months, she suddenly went into labor the day before yesterday. A midwife was called to deliver the baby, but for four days the fetus did not descend, which everyone found strange. On the morning of the 24th, she suddenly gave birth to more than ten small snakes, the larger ones about a foot long, and the smaller ones four or five inches long, all wriggling. The news spread at once, and those who came to see it wore out the threshold.</p>

The other day, Xiao could not bear the suffering and committed suicide by drowning. Her brother rushed to the scene after hearing the news, but instead of providing assistance, he pressed Xiao into the water, nearly drowning her. After being persuaded by Wang Lin, he went home. She was again beaten and scolded by Renbao. By noon the next day, Cunxi noticed that his daughter-in-law had not left the room. He called, but there was no response.

<h3 id="e77">Confucius's Daily Life and Interpretation of Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Sense of Shame <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— Kong Xiangxi</p>
<p>Since the Han Dynasty, China has revered Confucius. All aspects of national politics, economy, and the people's thoughts and lives have been guided by the teachings of Confucius. For over two thousand years, the continuation of national life and the flourishing of Eastern culture have been inseparable from his teachings. However, since the opening of the country to foreign influences and the influx of Western culture, the Chinese people have suddenly lost confidence. Conflicting views on safety and different perspectives on what to adopt and discard have emerged. Those who are infatuated with modern theories often seek novelty and difference, even advocating for the overthrow of Confucianism. With the foundation shaken, social customs have gradually deteriorated, causing concern among those who are aware of the times. As a descendant of the Sage and having heard the late Premier's call to restore traditional morality to save China, at a time when the nation is in decline and in need of urgent salvation, I originally intended to write about the thoughts and actions of the Sage based on my limited knowledge, focusing on the Analects. Coinciding with the Sage's birthday, I dare to present a table summarizing the Sage's daily life and his teachings on propriety, justice, integrity, and sense of shame. Although times have changed, the Sage's words and actions may not be fully imitable, but if all compatriots can emulate his rigorous and disciplined spirit, the social customs will naturally undergo a transformation. Only then can we jointly strive for the cause of national revival. This is my humble intention. The first part concerns the Sage's daily life, divided into material, spiritual, and conversational aspects. The material aspects, including clothing, food, housing, and travel, are sufficient to establish a new standard of living. The spiritual aspects include the pursuit of struggle, harmony, joy, comfort, love, humility, diligence, respect, and thoroughness. Conversations are divided into elegant speech, rare speech, and silence. The model set forth serves as a template for all. The second part concerns the Sage's discussions on propriety, justice, integrity, and sense of shame. The Analects contains the word "propriety" (禮) but not "unreasonableness" (無理). The Sage aimed to guide the people into a structured way of life and did not wish to engage in empty talk of human nature. Therefore, propriety is about conduct (履), enabling people to act together. I now present its outline, dividing it into categories. Justice (義) means appropriateness (宜), tailoring things to be appropriate. The Analects discusses how to act in various situations, acquire wealth, interact with others, manage affairs, speak, serve the ruler, and govern the people, providing a path of justice to follow, so that the people's morals have a principle. Integrity (廉) means self-restraint (歛), extended to mean upholding integrity and being able to restrain oneself. The Analects contains one instance of the word "integrity" (廉), which originally meant self-restraint, not the virtue of incorruptibility. Only Gong Wei's lack of desire was interpreted by earlier scholars using the word "integrity." The frugality of cultivating integrity, the way to deal with wealth, the effect of advocating integrity, and the distinction between righteousness and profit are all deeply and clearly stated. The character for "shame" (恥) consists of "ear" (耳) and "heart" (心), signifying the feeling of shame upon hearing wrongdoing. When people feel ashamed, their ears turn red and their faces flush, which is the sign of it. The Doctrine of the Mean says that knowing shame is close to courage. Wang Chuanshan said that shame is easy but knowing is difficult, and only by knowing what to choose can one be considered to have shame. Now, observing the Analects' earnest teaching on shame, I list the four major aspects of conduct, interpersonal relations, civilizing the people, and interacting with neighbors to clarify what to choose. I have also included the different schools of thought within the Confucian tradition, with explanations for each, hoping to discuss them with fellow countrymen and gentlemen who admire Confucianism and discuss national affairs.</p>

<p>Note 3: See Shi Ming. Note 4: See Shi Ming.</p>
<p>Note 5: Based on Su Xing's theory, see Wang Xianqian's Shi Ming Shu Zheng Bu Suo Yin.</p>
<p>Note 6: See Liu Shu Zong Yao. Note 7: See Chuanshan's posthumous writings.</p>
<p>Note 1: Liu Baonan's Lun Yu Shuo Zheng Yi quotes Wei Zhao's commentary on Guo Yu: "Yan means extreme." Confucius himself spoke of coarse rice and plain water, finding joy in them. He praised Yan Hui's simple meals and drinking water from a gourd, and Yu's plain food and drink. He also said that scholars should be ashamed of wearing poor clothes and eating poor food, which is not worth discussing. Here, he meant that he did not eat the most refined food or the most finely sliced meat. Liu's statement is correct.</p>
<p>Note 2: Xu Lianxuan's Confucius' Life states: "There is no record of Confucius' residence in the Analects Xiangdang Chapter. Other chapters and many books relating to and discussing Confucius also do not mention it." Confucius was a person who valued consistency between words and actions. Based on what he said, we can infer where he lived.</p>
<p>Note 3: Yu Zhengbian's Gui Yi Cun Gao: "The Book of Poetry and the Book of Documents are extensively quoted, and propriety must be spoken in accordance with the person and the time. Speak of benevolence to the father, and filial piety to the son. Elegant speech is the execution of propriety."</p>
<p>Note: Yang Shouchang of the Education Magazine's Special Issue on Reading the Classics says: "The words 'ruler' and 'minister' are merely pronouns for leader and assistant. Therefore, the names of ruler and minister can be changed, but the reality of ruler and minister remains. The rituals of bowing up and down need not be the same, but the assistant must have a corresponding respect for the leader."</p>
<p>Chen Peng's Dongshu Reading Notes: "The Analects mentions propriety in over forty chapters. From personal listening, speech, and action, to matters related to teaching children, serving the ruler, employing ministers, and governing the people, all are done with propriety. The aspects of propriety include reverence, deference, frugality, moderation, and culture. Its foundation lies in thrift, its application in harmony, and it is preceded by benevolence, righteousness, extensive learning, and different priorities for the advanced and the backward. If the backward follow the advanced, propriety, though abandoned, is still cherished. The Rites of Xia and Yin are insufficient to prove, yet can still be spoken of. The saying that archery is not about piercing the hide describes the text of the Book of Rites. The Xiangdang chapter is similar to the Records of Rites. The Analects' discussion of propriety is extensive and precise, and its exploration is inexhaustible. All that the Analects speaks of is propriety. Looking at the small things, such as walking quickly, is the propriety of the son seeing his father; bathing is the propriety of the minister seeing the ruler; offering a bundle of dried meat is the propriety of the disciple seeing the teacher for the first time; not arriving unless on public business is the propriety of the scholar seeing the official; three evasions is the impropriety of sitting beside; sitting in a position alongside the teacher is the impropriety of the student. The small things are like this, and the large things can be known."</p>
<p>Note: Huang Yizhou's Jing Xun Bi Yi: "The Doctrine of the Mean: 'Justice is appropriateness.' The Record of Sacrifices: 'Justice is this appropriateness.' The Record of Music: 'Justice rectifies it.' The Record of Rites: 'Justice is the standard of the world.' Jia Yi said: 'Conduct that is appropriate is called justice, and the opposite is called ignorance.' Note: Justice means appropriateness, the ability of the heart to judge right and wrong and act accordingly. Rectification and standards mean that justice can judge, this is the correct explanation of justice." Wen Yumin's Lun Yu Research: "To understand the true meaning of justice, one must first understand the boundaries between justice and propriety. Propriety is applied to a fixed name or a fixed event as a norm. However, human affairs are constantly changing, and there are fluid entities that cannot be named, and there are changing events that cannot be named, and there are some trivial events that cannot be named. Such facts cannot be governed by propriety, and it is necessary to advocate a sense of justice as a criterion for such affairs. Therefore, propriety is to maintain constancy, and justice is to adapt to change. This is the distinction between propriety and justice."</p>
<p>Note 1: Wang Fuzhi's Si Jie: "Learning is easy but liking is difficult, action is easy but striving is difficult, shame is easy but knowing is difficult. Not liking learning, not striving to act, all are not knowing shame and being ashamed of what is not worthy of shame. Therefore, shame must know how to choose, and then it can be said to have shame."</p>
<p>Note 2: Yan Yuan's Si Shu Zheng Wu: "In a country with the Way, one cannot serve the ruler and benefit the people, bringing about the governance of Tang and Yu, but only eating leisurely salary. In a country without the Way, one cannot help with difficulties and support danger, protecting the country, but only eating leisurely salary, this is deeply shameful." When there is the Way, being unable to jointly assist in great governance, but hiding away to claim nobility; when there is no Way, being unable to jointly perform the merit of restoring order, but only greedily seeking temporary wealth and honor, then their shame is the same.

We immediately formulated a preliminary plan for Shanghai institutions to implement a "Three-Huas" lifestyle, along with a set of key points for the first phase. These will be implemented first by civil servants in various institutions in the city, with the heads of each institution responsible for supervising and promoting the implementation. It is stipulated that each phase will last for two months, with this phase starting in September. We are sending you several copies of the key points, and we hope you will examine them and distribute them to your subordinates, one copy for each person, to be placed on their desks to facilitate implementation. We extend our official regards.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Telecommunications Administration of the Ministry of Transportation, in conjunction with the Zhejiang Provincial Telephone Bureau, issued a notice stating that Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are prosperous areas for commerce in the country and also the political center. The need for long-distance telephone services is extremely urgent. Therefore, in recent years, cities and larger towns in the two provinces have gradually installed and connected to the network. For the sake of further development, both parties have agreed on measures for mutual long-distance telephone communication between Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to handle communication matters between the two provinces. Starting from September 1st, all locations along the Beijing-Shanghai line in Jiangsu Province can be connected to various locations in Zhejiang Province via Yixing, Shanghai, Songjiang, Pingwang, and other bureaus. Those in Zhejiang Province who wish to call Jiangsu Province can do the same. According to international regulations, the call time will be changed from five minutes to three minutes per call. The pricing standard will be changed from pole line distance to spatial distance. In the future, after implementation, not only will communication be faster and prices lower, but the relationship between the two provinces will definitely be closer. It is truly a case of "a thousand miles apart, breathing can communicate." The convenience for people from all walks of life to communicate is truly not insignificant. In addition to a separate price list for reference, fearing that it may not be widely known, this notice is hereby issued.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Jiangsu Telecommunications Administration of the Ministry of Transportation also issued Notice No. 1393, stating that it had received Instruction No. 3778 from the Ministry of Transportation's Telecommunications Department, which stated that long-distance telephone calls in European and American countries are all based on a three-minute system. In order to meet international telephone standards and connect to international long-distance calls in the future, the Ministry has decided to change the long-distance call time in this area and Jiangsu and Zhejiang from five minutes to three minutes according to international regulations. The telephone rate will be based on spatial distance, effective from September 1st. (The following is omitted) We are instructed to comply and report accordingly. This notice is hereby issued, announcing that starting from September 1st, the call time for long-distance calls in this area and Jiangsu and Zhejiang will be changed from five minutes to three minutes, and a revised telephone rate list will be reissued for reference. In addition to sending separate letters, fearing that it may not be widely known, this notice is hereby issued.</p>

<p>Residents of Jin Shenfu Road and Lafeide Road in the French Concession of this city are opposed to the French Municipal Council increasing house tax by two to five times in July of this year. Therefore, they sent a joint letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association in the Concession yesterday, requesting them to uphold justice and negotiate with reason. The original letter and tax increase table are excerpted below:</p>
<p>Request for Negotiation</p>
<p>Respected Sirs, on the 7th of this month, the French Municipal Council sent people to our residences to collect house tax for July of this year, suddenly increasing the amount by two or three times the previous amount, or even four or five times. We believe that our residences are mostly old and dilapidated. At this time of economic downturn and lack of prosperity in various industries, with increasing unemployment, it is difficult to maintain the old taxes, how can we bear such heavy taxes? Moreover, because of the reduction in rents in various places, house taxes have also fallen accordingly. Not only have we not enjoyed the benefits of tax reductions, but we have suffered the misfortune of this harsh tax. Therefore, we have specially jointly written to your association, requesting you to uphold justice and negotiate with the French Municipal Council in a practical manner. We are extremely hopeful. Addressed to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association in the French Concession.</p>

(A letter to landlords throughout the city and a letter to tenants). The case was approved.</p>
<p>Appealing for Rent Reduction The Joint Association sent a letter to landlords throughout the city appealing for rent reduction, stating: To all landlords in the city, may you be aware that the severity of the current era is unparalleled, and the magnitude of the situation is different from the past. This is known to all people in the country. Tracing back to the great world economic panic that occurred in the 18th year of the Republic of China, and continuing to this day, rural areas went bankrupt first, followed by urban collapse. Factories closed down, businesses ceased operations, and the number of unemployed citizens reached more than 500,000. The depletion of finance and the depression of the market are beyond description. How can we survive in this serious crisis? Moreover, the invading forces of the great powers are advancing rapidly and irresistibly. For us, the past of "treading on frost and firm ice" has already passed, and the present of "stripping the bed and reaching the skin" is coming. Unemployment is increasing day by day, and society is becoming increasingly unstable. At this time, the only way is to rise up urgently to save ourselves, seek common solutions, use clear understanding to understand subtle changes, use the talent and wisdom of the masses, turn the tide, and promote the practice of rent reduction, calling for reduced rents everywhere, seeking to achieve the goal. We respectfully ask all landlords in the city to understand our sincerity, agree to voluntarily reduce rents, do your best to do what is in line with humanity, alleviate the people's difficulties, and revive people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>A Letter to Tenants The association also sent a letter to tenants, stating: Comrades and compatriots throughout the city, in the state of world depression, our economy is in a state of decline. Recalling the two incidents of January 28th and January 28th, our people's attempts to gradually recover and the past dream of prosperity have been shattered. At this critical moment of survival, we should unite to save our own future. The paper image of singing and dancing in a time of peace has been torn apart by the power of the times. Today, the people of Shanghai are unemployed and committing suicide, all suffering from the economic collapse and the reasons for the market depression. Therefore, comparing Shanghai five years ago with the Shanghai of today is a great setback. Since our road to life is in a situation of irreparable disaster, please think about it, compatriots. Since the environment we are in is so bad, isn't the rent you pay still the same as before? We must reduce our own burden and start with self-help first. Feeling the crisis of the Chinese people, and with weak personal abilities, therefore, the most effective method of self-help that we can implement is to organize a rent reduction committee to reduce our burden, plan for the revival of people's livelihoods, and use the power of the masses to support our small contributions and strive together in the national economy. Compatriots, please be sure to rise up and work hard to reduce your own burden.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Director of the Industry and Commerce Revitalization Association, Wang Yansong, Returns to Shanghai from Beijing <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Wang Yansong, Director of the Industry and Commerce Revitalization Committee of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, went to Beijing a few days ago to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and returned to Shanghai after completing his official duties yesterday morning. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned that Wang's trip to Beijing included not only meeting with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to explain the recent situation of Shanghai's industry and commerce and future revitalization plans in detail, but also meeting with Minister Chen Gongbo of the Ministry of Industry to discuss the consolidation of industry and international trade, the operation of major industries with national strength, and the assistance of industry and commerce in improving production. Because Wang had been away from Beijing for a long time, this trip involved a lot of socializing with old friends from various ministries and departments. He stayed in Beijing for three days before returning to Shanghai at 7:00 AM yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e88">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Submits a Report to the Ministry, Urging the Handling of Industrial Control; Without Planning to Save Overproduction, the Collapse of the Entire Industry Is Inevitable <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, in order to urge the government to adopt the suggestion of industrial control, submitted a report to the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Industry, stating that the association had previously submitted a draft of the Industrial Control Regulations, but had not received an order to reply. We respectfully submit a report again, urging a swift review and implementation. The association previously submitted a case on April 20th, with Committee Member Jin Runxiang proposing the implementation of industrial control, along with 16 articles of the control regulations, as No. 163, requesting your approval and adoption. The matter concerns the overall situation and is an initiative that should be carefully and thoroughly considered. However, four months have passed and no instructions have been received. If no urgent plan is made to save the overproduction situation, the risk of the collapse of the entire industry is feared to be unavoidable. The matter is urgent and compelling, so we have prepared a document to submit, respectfully requesting your examination and approval, and a prompt selection and ordering of compliance, which would be a public convenience.</p>
<h3 id="e89">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Explains That There Is No Maximum Limit to the Progressive Stamp Tax on Insurance Policies, etc. <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter yesterday to the Zhonghua Book Company, instructing on the stamp tax method for insurance policies, mortgages, etc.: (1) The stamp tax rate for insurance policies in Article 14 of the tax rate table is based on a stamp tax unit of every 1,000 yuan. 2 cents of stamp tax for 1,000 yuan, 4 cents of stamp tax for 2,000 yuan, and so on. However, if the total amount of the policy is more than 1,000 yuan but less than 2,000 yuan, the excess amount, even if it is less than one unit, is calculated as one unit. For example, if the insured amount is 1,500 yuan, the stamp tax should be affixed according to the 2,000 yuan example. (2) The loan or mortgage documents in Article 19 of the tax rate table are progressively stamped and have no maximum limit. Each 100 yuan is a unit, and the unit increases, and the tax rate also increases by 2 cents. For example, 2 yuan for 10,000 yuan, and 200 yuan for 1 million yuan. This is the biggest key difference between the new tax law and the old regulations.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Ministry of Transportation Appoints Zhang Mingxin as Director of the Insurance Department of the Savings and Remittance Bureau; Simple Life Insurance Will Be Implemented Next Month <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>

Simple life insurance is currently being actively prepared, and it is estimated that it will be implemented by the middle of next month at the earliest. Yesterday, the "Special Telegram from Nanjing on the 25th" on page 4 of the first section of this newspaper stated that "Zhang Mingqin temporarily replaced Zhang Mingxin as the Director of the Insurance Department of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau." The character "Qin" is a mistake for "Xin," and is specially corrected here.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Collection Team Office of the Chinese Aviation Association held its 26th departmental meeting at 2:00 PM on the 24th at its office to discuss the fundraising progress and direction. Attendees included Director-General Li Dachao, Secretaries Zhang Yuliang, Zhou Songhe, Chen Shuo, Liu Songtao, Li Jiming, Bao Lengxue, Li Wenyao, Zhang Xiamin, Zhu Shengyang, Xue Baolun, Gu Shangrui, Lu Zhangyan, Wei Jianxin, and Song Zheng, among others. The meeting was chaired by Director-General Li, and Chen Shuo served as the recorder. The chairman's report briefly stated that since the start of the collection and fundraising campaign at the office, all appointed team leaders, deputy team leaders, and team members have been enthusiastic and capable individuals, and have been very diligent in collecting donations. However, due to the summer heat in the past month, team leaders went out to avoid the heat, and schools at all levels were on vacation, so some of the work was somewhat stagnated. Now that autumn is approaching, those who have avoided the heat have returned one after another, various industries are also slightly active, and schools will start soon. Promotion should be carried out separately, urging efforts to be stepped up. The priority of work should be determined based on the environment and nature of each team leader. It is hoped that the field secretaries will pay attention to this point, so as to complete the fundraising campaign as soon as possible. The collection of aviation donations from dance halls throughout the city officially began on the 15th of this month. With the assistance of the municipal government and the authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession, the dance halls and people from all walks of life have enthusiastically donated, and the progress has been very smooth and the results are quite impressive. The collection of aviation donations from the sand and gravel industry, which was previously proposed by the trade association and approved by the office, and personnel were sent to negotiate, decided to uniformly collect 5 cents per ton of sand and gravel, with the goal of collecting 100,000 yuan. It started on the 21st and is progressing very smoothly, and a collection committee has been organized to take special responsibility, which has already been approved. It is hoped that the field secretaries will earnestly assist and strive to promote it, so as to enhance the actual effect. As for the aviation sports and entertainment fair proposed by Lu Shoulian, the leader of Collection Team 253, preparations had been made previously, but it was temporarily suspended due to the hot weather. Now that autumn is approaching, efforts should be made to handle it and promote it as soon as possible, so that it can be held in September, etc. Following the report of the field secretaries on the progress of the negotiations, the fundraising promotion plan was discussed in many cases, and the meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Dong Daxi, the leader of Team 306, paid 212 yuan in membership fees. Chen Zi, a member of Team 70, paid 164 yuan in donations.

<p>The Hongqiao Sanatorium in this city was built by Mr. Ding Fubao. Although its scale is not very large, its architecture and equipment are state-of-the-art. Moreover, it is located in western Shanghai, with a quiet environment, making it ideal for patients to recuperate. Since Mr. Yan Fuqing has been the director of the sanatorium, he has strived to develop both medical and administrative affairs, gradually becoming known to the public. The number of people seeking medical treatment has also been increasing day by day, especially in obstetrics and gynecology, which has become quite crowded. Therefore, Mr. Wang Yihui, director of obstetrics and gynecology at the National Shanghai Medical College, has been invited to be the vice president of the sanatorium to meet the needs of local people. Recently, the sanatorium, in view of the urgent need for medicine in the local area, has reduced the cost of first-class wards and changed the first-class wards from two to four yuan, in order to provide universal service. All other medical expenses have been stipulated separately so that local people can seek medical treatment according to their personal economic strength.</p>

<p>Xu Xueyu, Director of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, was specially appointed by the Ministry of Transportation to reorganize the long-distance telephone and telegraph lines between Ba County, Chengdu, and Emei in Sichuan Province, and various telephone projects in Chengdu City. Director Xu led his staff to Sichuan in early July, and large quantities of materials were successively transported to various sections. After active progress, the project was completed on the 24th of this month, and the voice quality is clear. The details are as follows: From Ba County through Yongchuan, Rongchang, Longchang, Neijiang, Zizhong, Ziyang, Jianyang, to Chengdu, is the Ba-Cheng line, which is 1,050 li long. From Chengdu through Xinjin, Meishan, Jiajiang, to Emei, is the Cheng-E line, which is more than 500 li long. Both lines are equipped with telegraph and telephone lines. The two lines pass through many high mountains and ridges, and the construction was quite difficult. Moreover, due to inconvenient transportation, the transportation of materials was extremely difficult. At the time, it was summer, with alternating rain and sunshine, and unstable cold and heat, and workers often suffered from diseases. The completion of more than 1,500 li of long-distance lines in such a short period of time is truly an unprecedented achievement in the country. It is said that the Chengdu city telephone system will also be completed and opened for service within the month.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Drowning at Riva-Luzern Village <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The garden in Riva-Luzern Village, north of Suzhou Creek, has all kinds of recreational facilities, including a small river with several small boats for people to enjoy themselves. It costs one yuan per hour, or six jiao for half an hour. Swimming is also allowed, and young people flock to it. However, last spring, five male and female tourists were riding in two small boats, enjoying themselves on the river. Unexpectedly, joy turned to sorrow. The two small boats raced ahead side by side and suddenly collided, causing both small boats to capsize. Two men and women drowned on the spot. The local court was immediately requested to send personnel to verify the bodies and coffin. Afterwards, Wei Jiechen, the patrol officer of the Zhoujiaqiao police station under the Zengjiadu police station in charge, posted a notice to ban it to prevent the occurrence of danger after seeing the tragic situation. Unexpectedly, not long after, another tragedy occurred. At about 4 p.m. the day before yesterday, Shen Genyou (aged 19, from Ningbo, an apprentice at the Jushulu Science Printing and Iron Factory) was also learning to swim in the small river in the village. For some reason, he struggled after entering the water for a short time and sank to the bottom of the river without resurfacing. Another tourist noticed and called for help. Then, they tried to retrieve Shen Genyou, who was already gasping for breath and about to die. He was then taken to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment. However, Shen Genyou had been underwater for too long, and his internal organs were damaged and could not be saved. He soon died. Tracing the cause of the disaster, the organizers of the village were undeniably responsible for the inadequate facilities. Yesterday morning, Chen Yiqing, the local baojia of the 28th bao 4th tu, was ordered by the police to report to the local court for an autopsy. After receiving the report, the court dispatched Prosecutor Du Jiasheng and Examiner Shen Qixiu to the scene in the afternoon to verify that it was indeed a drowning. He was ordered to be coffined and prepared for further instructions.</p>

<p>No. 639, the corner of Avenue Edward VII and Chengdu Road, is an employment agency, with a sign hanging that reads "Little Ningbo Introducer." Therefore, most of the male and female domestic workers are from Yong. Usually, the business is enough to cover expenses. The house of the employment agency is dilapidated, and the veranda along the street collapsed suddenly at about 4:30 p.m. yesterday due to disrepair. Many male and female domestic workers were sitting on the wooden door panels below, directly in the path of the collapse. Five men and women were injured. The names are listed below: (Male) Wan Yuefa, 42 years old, from Yong, injured in the head and fractured his left foot; (Female) Li Xiaoju, 20 years old, from Yong, injured in the head; Ye Alin, 37 years old, from Ningbo, injured in the head; Zhang Ding, 36 years old, injured in the head and arms; Zhang Aizhu, 18 years old, injured in the face. After the accident, the Xinzha Patrol Room in charge dispatched Patrol Officer No. 62 to investigate, and then summoned an ambulance to fly to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Huang Xianyao's Forgery Case Concluded; Sentencing on the 31st <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Huang Xianyao, the second son of the late Huang Chuqiu, the founder of the Gongfa Company, the Riyue Bank, and the Great World Amusement Park from Shaoxing Yuyao, is 31 years old this year and works at the Zhongxi Drugstore on the Fourth Road. Previously, in order to defraud his father-in-law, Zhou Songqing, a local, of money, he colluded with lawyer Mi Jingshen (now withdrawn from the association) and Mi's clerk, Wu Jiajin, to forge a document from Zhou Songqing stating that he would preserve Huang's property. When the major event was over, 100,000 yuan would be distributed to Xianyao's family and handed over to him for safekeeping. First, he filed a petition for mediation against Zhou in the Shanghai District Court, but it failed. The document was placed in a safe deposit box at the Guohua Bank. Later, Wang Shaozeng, a creditor of Gongfa Company, found a photograph of the document and hired lawyer Xu Yannian to file a private prosecution in the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court against Zhou Songqing and Huang Xianyao, a son-in-law, for damaging creditors' rights. After repeated summons, Huang consistently refused to appear in court, and only Zhou appeared in court, denying that he had issued the document or that he had been entrusted with managing property. Later, the court ordered the issuance of an arrest warrant to arrest Huang. After Huang was arrested, personnel were sent to the Guohua Bank to open the safe deposit box and obtain the original document. Zhou Songqing then filed a lawsuit with the French Concession police against Huang Xianyao for forging the document, causing the creditor's rights damage case to be suspended, pending the investigation and public prosecution by the French Concession police, and the French Concession police took Huang Xianyao for investigation (the Criminal Court ordered a deposit of 50,000 yuan from a shop guarantor, but without a guarantor, he was detained in the detention center). As a result, enlarged photographs of the document were taken and identified by experts, confirming that it was not written by Zhou Songqing. Huang was then sent to the Second Special District Court, and the police department filed a public prosecution for forgery. After repeated hearings by Judge Li Changnian, Huang confessed that the co-defendants Mi Jingshen and Wu Jiajin had left Shanghai and could not be arrested. He was ordered to reschedule the hearing and await the suspension of the investigation of the previous case file. The situation has been reported in the previous two reports. However, the two defendants, Mi and Wu, have not yet been arrested. Yesterday morning, Judge Li of the Second Special District Court came to Criminal Court No. 1 and ordered Huang Xianyao to be brought for questioning. Huang's testimony was the same as that recorded in the previous report and will not be recorded again. The court then ordered the commencement of arguments. After the police department's lawyer, Gu Shouxi, and Huang's defense lawyer argued with each other, the court announced the conclusion and scheduled sentencing for the 31st of this month. Huang was still returned to the detention center.</p>

<p>Ancient Chinese literature is as vast as the sea. In addition to classics, history, philosophy, and collections of writings, there are rare and valuable works that are not widely circulated. Moreover, poetry, prose, and novels published in the Ming Dynasty were often subject to Qing Dynasty bans, making them even more difficult to obtain. One volume, one edition, can easily cost hundreds of taels of silver, making them the exclusive domain of collectors. The Shanghai Magazine Company wants to realize the plan of making the series easier to record and popularizing the treasures. It has requested Lu Jiye, A Ying, Shi Zhecun, and others to search for rare books and borrow handwritten copies, selecting 50 types to compile the first series of "Rare Treasures of Chinese Literature." Based on the first edition of the best edition, sentences are carefully punctuated and proofread, totaling 10 million words, printed into more than 20,000 pages, and divided into 70 thick volumes. Starting from mid-September, one type will be published every Saturday, ranging from 200,000 to 600,000 words, antique and precious, packed in a wooden box, neat and beautiful. To suit the reader's time and economy, pre-orders will be sold for one month starting today. The entire series costs only fifteen yuan, plus one yuan and five jiao for shipping outside the city. The book box costs three yuan. The name of the purchaser can be engraved. The pre-order price is cheap. The first edition will not be sufficient to cover costs unless it reaches 2,000 copies. The pre-order catalog and samples are printed separately and can be requested. The publications for September include Yuan Xiaoxiu's Diary, Liuting's Poetry Talk, Jin Ping Mei, Initial Slaps on the Table, Lyrics of Sixty Famous Song Dynasty Poets, Collection of Tang Dynasty Legends, Complete Collection of Song Dynasty Zaju, and A Brief Record of Sights and Objects in the Imperial Capital, all of which are famous and valuable.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Prosecutor Xiao Jinying's Home Robbed <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Xiao Jinying, a prosecutor at the Shanghai District Court, resides at No. 8, Hulin Lane, Jiandao Bridge, Humin South Extension Road, west of the court, which is a single shikumen building. At 7:00 a.m. yesterday, Prosecutor Xiao left his residence to go to the court to work. At about 8:00 a.m., three thugs wearing white Zhongshan suits, aged between 20 and 40, holding a blue-covered foreign notebook, broke into Xiao's residence at No. 8, pretending to be there to record the electricity meter. At that time, the servants did not pay attention. The thugs immediately drew out pistols, forbidding them to make any noise, went upstairs to search and rob, and then fled with the loot. Afterwards, the family reported to Xiao, who returned to his residence and checked. It was found that 206 yuan in cash and clothing had been robbed, as well as a leather suitcase (the suitcase did not belong to Xiao, but was left by a friend. What was stored in the suitcase in Xiao's house is unknown). Xiao immediately opened a list and reported to the Ximen Branch Bureau, requesting an investigation. It is said that the thieves dared to gather a crowd and rob the prosecutor's home in broad daylight with weapons, truly fearing no law.</p>

<p>At around 11:00 a.m. yesterday, a robbery of a pawnshop owner's wife by three robbers (two men and one woman) occurred at the intersection of Route Lafayette and Route du Marche in the French Concession. The amount robbed was 1,200 yuan. The robbers fled into the Chinese Concession after obtaining the loot, crossing the French Concession iron fence. The entire detective team of the Ximen Branch of the Public Security Bureau, and the heads of various police stations, bravely surrounded and captured them. The robbers fired guns along the way to resist arrest. The two sides exchanged fire more than a hundred times. As a result, one robber was shot and captured, one policeman was injured, and stray bullets injured many passersby. Four suspects were intercepted. At that time, the order in the Tangjiawan area was very chaotic, and it took about three quarters of an hour to restore order. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Woman Sends Money</p>
<p>Zhu Qiuhui, 39 years old, from Huizhou, is a shareholder of the Qiaoyuan Pawnshop at No. 31 Chengyuli, Route du Marche, French Concession. Zhu works at the pawnshop. The pawnshop has long been in contact with the Guangda Pawnshop on nearby Rue Baille. Therefore, when both pawnshops are short of money, they often accommodate each other, which is customary. Because Shanghai is unstable, in order to avoid attracting the attention of robbers, Qiaoyuan sends Zhu's wife, Wu (37 years old, from the same hometown as Zhu), to take money whenever money is needed.</p>
<p>Using Pepper Powder to Blind</p>
<p>At about 11:20 a.m. yesterday, Zhu sent his wife to Guangda to take money. Wu walked alone to Guangda, obtained 1,200 silver dollars, and hid the money in her pocket. As she turned to return along the original road, three robbers, two men and one woman, suddenly jumped out from the roadside. The two men were wearing short clothes, each holding a pistol, and forbade Wu to make any noise. One of the robbers even used pepper powder that had been prepared in advance, and threw it into Wu's eyes. Wu was caught off guard and was blinded.</p>
<p>Shouting "Catch the Robbers"</p>
<p>At the same time, one robber went forward and robbed all 1,200 silver dollars from Wu. The three robbers obtained the loot, entered Nanshengli from Route du Marche North, crossed the French Concession iron fence to the Tangjiawan small vegetable market, and fled along Xilin Houlou. Although Wu's eyes were blinded by the pepper powder, she still chased desperately. Shouting "Catch the robbers," the police whistle sounded on the road. The robbers knew that things were bad and ran along Fangxie Road through Xilin Houlou, firing guns along the way. At that time, Police Officer Li Rongsheng of Post No. 12 and Police Officer Li Zhenbai of Post No. 15 of the Ximen Branch of the Public Security Bureau heard the alarm and rushed to the scene. They met the robbers head-on, and the two sides exchanged fire. During the exchange of fire, Police Officer Li Zhenbai was hit by a bullet in the foot and immediately fell to the ground. However, Police Officer Li Rongsheng still pursued closely. When he chased to the intersection of Fangxie Branch Road, Shen Wenda, the squad leader of the detective team of the Ximen Branch, had heard the alarm and, together with Deputy Squad Leader Luo Weixin, Team Leader Li Taochen, Yu Ruhai, Chen Enrong, Jiao Baojun, Zheng Yongxiang, Yang Jisheng, Bian Wenguang, and other detectives, advanced from Wansheng Road southward and from Fangxie Road. They met the robbers in front of the Kongtongsheng Clock and Watch Shop, and the two sides began fighting again. The sound of gunfire was like a string of pearls, totaling seventy or eighty shots.</p>
<p>Original Stolen Money Recovered</p>
<p>At this time, the robbers had fallen into encirclement. With many detectives in front and pursuing police in the rear, they fought desperately, hoping to escape. However, because the gunshots were too fierce, one robber was shot and fell in front of Brothers Shop Nos. 146-147 Fangxie Road, and was captured. A pistol No. 886 was seized, and 110 yuan of the original stolen money was recovered. At the same time, Branch Chief Police Officer Li also supervised a large number of police officers to pursue and intercept at various key roads. As a result, four more suspects were apprehended, brought to the bureau, and interrogated one by one.</p>
<p>Many Robbers Intercepted</p>
<p>The robber who was intercepted on the spot, Hong Chen Hongyuan, 44 years old, from Qingjiang, admitted that he had colluded with the gang to commit robbery. The other four suspects were: Zhao Baoyou, 27 years old, from Anhui; Fan Fangtai, 26 years old, from Jiangxi; Lin Shungen, 19 years old, from Wuxi; and Shi Yunzhang, 48 years old, from Yangzhou. The injured Police Officer Li Zhenbai and the injured robber Chen Hongyuan were sent to the hospital for treatment first. The rest were detained for investigation. However, because the robber Chen Hongyuan had a minor injury to his foot, he was bandaged and immediately led the team for interrogation.</p>
<p>Stray Bullets Injure Passersby</p>
<p>During the fierce battle, bullets flew everywhere and injured many passersby. They include: Lu Honggen, 42 years old, from Dongtai, a laborer, slightly injured; Zhao Tingdong, 43 years old, from Funing, a rickshaw puller, severely injured in the arm bone; Lu Fulai, 26 years old, from Fujian, an assistant at No. 147 Zhaozhou Road, shot in the chest, which is very dangerous; Sun Jinji, 44 years old, from Shaoxing, injured in the arm; and Du Yang, a woman, 28 years old, from Wujiang, who was sitting in an employment agency on Xilin Road at the time, injured in the legs and arms. The above persons were all taken to the Shanghai Hospital by Branch Chief Police Officer Li for treatment. In addition, a car with license No. 4837 of the Xiang Sheng Automobile Company was also hit by stray bullets, with a hole pierced in the right door. In addition to immediately reporting to Director Cai, Branch Chief Police Officer Li also ordered his subordinates to strictly arrest the remaining accomplices.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Yu Changzi's Case of Breach of Trust and False Prosecution; Plaintiff Requests Change of Jurisdiction; Whether the Trial Should Be Handled by Other Courts is Up to the Superior Court to Decide; Both Lu Xihou and Yu Changzi Did Not Appear in Court Yesterday <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Yu Changzi, a judge of the Civil Court of the Shanghai First Special District Court, was handling the case of Lu Xihou, chairman of the board of directors of the China Industrial Bank, applying for the bank to be declared bankrupt and sending personnel to clear its accounts after the bank went bankrupt. While it was in progress, a report was submitted proposing terms of reconciliation with the creditors. He immediately notified all creditors of the proposed reconciliation plan. Lu then believed that the reconciliation terms stated in Judge Yu's notice were inconsistent with the report, considering it greatly harmful to him. He hired a lawyer to file a criminal private prosecution against Yu with the First Special District Court for forging documents. This type of lawsuit is unprecedented in this city. Since it was published in the newspapers, the outside world has paid close attention to it. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 p.m., was the date scheduled for the opening of the case. Many people originally planned to go to the court to listen to the proceedings. It happened that at 1:00 p.m., the sky suddenly became overcast, followed by thunderstorms. The period between 1:30 p.m. and 2:15 p.m. was the most intense, with lightning flashing and thunder roaring. The heavy rain poured down, and there were few pedestrians and vehicles on the road. The case of a judge being sued, which everyone was watching, was held at this time in the No. 8 courtroom on the second floor of the court. Therefore, the gallery was surprisingly empty, an unexpected sight. The bleak situation was no different from the trial of an ordinary private prosecution case. The only difference was that a Western staff member specially dispatched by the Public Works Department, led a Chinese interpreter to the court to record the proceedings. Although the defendant, Judge Yu Changzi, had been privately prosecuted, he continued to perform his duties as usual. It was said that he had already submitted a plea according to law, but he did not appear in court yesterday, nor did he appoint a lawyer to represent him. After receiving the court summons, the plaintiff, Lu Xihou, instructed his lawyer to submit a petition to the court, requesting a change of jurisdiction and a transfer to another court for trial. He also did not appear in court yesterday. His lawyer appeared in court and said that Lu was not in Shanghai. Judge Wu, because both parties had not appeared in court, and the plaintiff had petitioned for a change of jurisdiction, immediately instructed that "the case has been petitioned by the plaintiff for a change of jurisdiction, and the matter will be handled according to law after the higher court has ruled," and adjourned court.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of autumn in this city, the weather has suddenly turned hot. Although there are occasional showers, it has not cooled down. At about 2:00 p.m. yesterday, dark clouds gathered, lightning flashed, and thunder roared, deafening. In a short time, heavy rain poured down, lasting for about two hours. The sun then reappeared, but low-lying areas had become a swamp. In the most bustling areas, such as the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road, the water accumulated to a depth of several inches, making it difficult for trams and cars to travel. Rickshaws were a hundred times more profitable. However, by this morning, a cool breeze suddenly struck, and heavy rain poured down, causing the thermometer to plummet.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, dark clouds gathered in the sky, and heavy rain poured down. At about 2:00 p.m., thunder and lightning struck, deafening. At that time, Qian Da (32 years old), a partner from Rufou, was working at a stove shop in a shed behind Tongchunfu in Laobaibo, Pudong. Because it was raining heavily and no one was fetching water, he was mixing water in the various water pots with a water ladle when suddenly a thunderbolt struck, electrocuting Qian Da and killing him. He fell inside the door, with his head to the north and feet to the south, and no breath left. Yang Zhongquan, the head of the Yangjiabo Police Station, heard the report and sent police officers to investigate. They saw that the deceased was bare-chested and wearing shorts. His skin had not changed color. It was learned that the owner of the shop had returned to his hometown and had not returned. Zhu Henian is currently managing the shop. The deceased has no relatives in Shanghai. The police station head has instructed the local baojia, Yang Baobao, to report to the local court and request an autopsy for the purpose of collecting the body for burial.</p>

<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession, yesterday sent a letter to the Public Works Department (工部局), which read: "Sir, according to a letter from the Shijin Taiji Printing Bureau (時進泰記印務局), we received a warning letter from the telephone company stating that the telephone bill in question must be paid immediately, otherwise the line would be cut. Upon reading this, we were extremely surprised. We immediately sent a letter on the 17th stating that we had a receipt as proof. The telephone bill is paid within ten days of receiving the bill, and we have a receipt as proof. Such errors have occurred several times before, including listing paid bills on the statement without noticing. What is the basis for this warning letter? On the morning of the 20th, the line was cut. The company should be fully responsible for the loss of reputation and business suffered by our firm. We are sending a copy of the company's receipt from August to the 26th of this month. Please examine it and arrange for negotiations to seek justice for our unwarranted losses."</p>
<p>The association also stated that the accounts of the Shanghai Telephone Company are extremely chaotic. The association receives reports about this almost daily, and it is common knowledge that overcharging and double-charging are frequent occurrences, while some go without payment for six months to a year. There have already been one or two such reports. For those who have paid but have their lines cut, such losses are difficult for users to calculate. It is even stranger that some can continue to talk for months without paying, which increases the burden on other responsible users. Even stranger, some continue to receive monthly bills for months after their lines have been cut. Such bad debts are passed on to other responsible users through price increases. The company's chaotic accounts also mean that there are many unnecessary losses in management. The bureau should promptly exercise its supervisory powers to correct the company's major errors. After reading the attached documents, please return them immediately. Sincerely, to Mr. Fei, Acting Director-General of the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department."</p>
<h3 id="e109">North Station Loading and Unloading Workers: Old and New Workers Brawl, Railway Bureau Cancels Cooperative, Sends Personnel to Reorganize, More Than Twenty People Injured in the Fight for Work <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Loading and unloading workers at the North Station of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, new and old workers fought over work yesterday morning, leaving many injured. The following is a detailed report from a reporter of the Xin Sheng She (新聲社).</p>
<p>Personnel Sent to Reorganize: There are more than 130 official loading and unloading workers at the North Station. In the past, the workers formed the "Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway North Station Loading and Unloading Workers Cooperative," led by Gao Ge (高閣) and Cui Shitai (崔士太). These people were arrested and detained by the Garrison Headquarters on suspicion of being Communists. The Railway Bureau recently announced the cancellation of the cooperative on the 23rd because of poor management and sent Sun Zhusan (孫祝三) to reorganize it. The workers expressed their support for Sun's reorganization but strongly opposed the new workers taking over the work.</p>
<p>Section Chief's Announcement: A notice from the Su-Song Section of the Traffic Department stated, "Regarding the announcement, we have received an order from the Traffic Department stating that the loading and unloading workers' cooperative at the North Station is poorly managed and should be canceled immediately. With the approval of the Administration Bureau, Sun Zhusan is ordered to reorganize it within a specified period. During the reorganization, the Section Chief should pay close attention to all relevant accounts of the cooperative and clearly delineate them. In addition to notifying the police to assist, we urgently request the Section Chief to handle the matter carefully." The notice was issued by Section Chief Wang Shuchun (王樹春).</p>
<p>Old and New Fight: At 8:00 AM yesterday morning, Sun Zhusan, the contractor, led more than ten new workers to the freight yard at No. 5 Jiaotong Road to prepare for takeover. The old workers sent representatives Wei Yue (韋約) and Meng Hongyun (孟洪雲) to negotiate with Sun Zhusan. Immediately, the new workers and more than 100 temporary workers outside the gate started fighting with the old workers. (In the past, when work was busy, temporary workers were hired to help in addition to the original workers, but in recent years, business has been slow, and temporary workers have no work to do, so disputes have often arisen.) A large number of military police were dispatched by the 9th Platoon of the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Regiment of the Security Team of the 2nd Precinct of the 5th District of the Public Security Bureau and the police departments of both roads to suppress the violence, but they were ineffective.</p>
<p>List of Injured: As a result of the fighting, the following old workers were injured: (1) Liu Zhuanliang (劉專良), injured in the back; (2) Liu Dexing (劉德興), injured in the waist; (3) Xu Bulan (許步蘭), injured in the head; (4) Guo Xingru (郭興如), injured in the head; (5) Ding Wanshan (丁萬山), injured in the head; (6) Yang Ruqi (楊如其), injured in the face; (7) Jin Wanfu (金完福), injured in the waist. These seven people were bandaged at the Pazit Railway Hospital and then discharged. (8) Guo Shunfu (郭順甫), injured in the chest, remains hospitalized. (9) Xiao Sizi (小四子), injured in the eye; (10) Zhang Guangfu (張光甫), injured in the head; (11) Shi Gaoxiang (史高祥), injured in the face; (12) Substitute worker Yang Xiaoma Zhi (楊小麻支), injured in the head. The following new and temporary workers were injured: (1) Wang Jiaqing (王家慶), thirty holes in the head; (2) Bao Konghua (包孔華), internal injuries, bandaged and discharged from the Haig Road Red Cross Hospital; (3) Chang Jinshan (常金山), injured in the waist; (4) Wu Changsheng (吳長生), injured in the back; (5) Hu Yuebang (胡月邦), injured in the waist, hospitalized at Renji Hospital; (6) Ding Sugeng (丁素耕), injured in the head; (7) Xu Desheng (許德生), injured in the face; (8) Xi Qiaosen (奚巧森), injured in the shoulder; (9) Cao Guanggui (曹光桂), injured in the head; (10) Yuan Jintang (願金堂), injured in the hand; (11) Xie Chenggong (謝成功), injured in the hand; (12) Jin Bingtang (金炳堂), injured in the face; (13) Zhao Guangzhi (趙光志). The last two are hospitalized at Tongren Hospital.</p>
<p>Workers Detained: The Public Security Bureau of the 2nd Precinct of the 5th District detained the following workers from both sides who committed the violence: Meng Hongqi (孟洪其), Shi Gaoxiang (史高祥), Zhang Guangfu (張光甫), Yang Maosong (楊茂松), Wang Jiaqing (王家慶), Bao Zhahua (包扎華), Chang Jinshan (常金山), Wu Changsheng (吳長生), Xia Renchu (夏仁初), Yuan Jintang (願金堂), Zhu Dexi (朱德喜), Shi Jiezhi (石潔芝), Zhou Muyi (周慕頥), Pan Hanchen (潘涵臣), Wang Changhai (王長海), Li Defu (李德富), Tang Zhirong (唐志榮), Liu Chaoshan (劉朝山), Jin Bingfa (金炳發), Cao Guangrong (曹光榮), Zhang Kaitong (張凱通), Zhang Guangjin (張光金), Yang Shende (楊愼德), Yang Ruhe (楊如恒), Wang Hongzhang (王鴻章), Huang Yangai (黄揚藹), Li Yuzhu (李玉珠), Sun Zhizhi (孫　之), and more than 20 others, as well as those who came with Sun Zhu'er. They were all taken to the station for questioning. After Police Chief Chen Jiwu (陳繼武) failed to persuade them to stop, they were sent to the bureau at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Railway Bureau Investigates: All loading and unloading workers continue to load and unload goods as usual. A reporter from Xin Sheng She learned from the Railway Bureau yesterday that the bureau, in view of the North Station Loading and Unloading Workers Cooperative's inability to effectively manage the loading and unloading at the North Station, specially sent Sun San to reorganize it. Since the conflict occurred yesterday morning, the Traffic Department has sent officials from Nanjing to thoroughly investigate the matter and report to the bureau chief for review. It is believed that Sun Zhusan is a reorganization officer, and if the cooperative refuses to reorganize, it can be reported to the Railway Bureau for review. There should be no conflict with the cooperative. A fair disposition will be made after the investigation.</p>
<p>Party Headquarters' Response: The reporter also went to the Party Headquarters of both roads. A member of the committee informed us that the Railway Bureau's appointment of personnel to reorganize the cooperative was not known to the headquarters beforehand. After the incident, the truth was investigated separately and can be divided into three points: (1) The cause was purely a struggle for livelihood. The conflict between long-term workers and temporary workers arose from this. To avoid conflicts, the problem of workers' livelihoods must be solved. (2) Responsibility: Sun Zhusan was ordered to reorganize and should not have led new workers to compete for work. Therefore, Sun should bear full responsibility. (3) Aftermath: The Party Headquarters decided to deal with the matter in a reasonable and fair manner and has already reported the matter to the central government for instructions and a decision.</p>
<p>Sun Zhusan's Account: Sun Zhusan said that he was ordered by the Traffic Department to take over the loading and unloading work at the North Freight Yard on the 24th. To prevent misunderstandings, he repeatedly persuaded the workers on the 24th and 25th. At 8:00 AM on the 26th, he went to the yard again to prepare for the takeover. As he was talking to the workers' representatives Zhang Yue and Meng Hongyun, a martial drama suddenly broke out outside the yard. The yard immediately closed all the doors. Not long after, the long-term workers broke down the doors and entered the station chief's writing room, making things difficult for him. Fortunately, military police suppressed the violence, avoiding a major disaster. He only brought eleven or twelve people to the yard. He knew nothing about the fighting outside the yard beforehand. Finally, a large number of police officers from the Yongxing Road Police Station escorted him and the others to the police station. According to various statements, the two sides were still the past temporary workers and official workers fighting over work. The long-term workers believed that the fighting was caused by Sun. However, the results of the injuries on both sides showed that there were more than ten temporary workers injured, while only five or six long-term workers were injured. Sun immediately sent a letter from Xiao, director of the Traffic Department, to the Public Security Bureau to prove that he did not instigate the violence.</p>
<p>Railway Bureau's News: According to news from the Railway Bureau yesterday, the original workers and temporary workers in the Loading and Unloading Cooperative at the North Station on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway were divided into two factions, who were hostile to each other and often had disputes. The cooperative's chief foreman, Gao Ge, and the temporary workers' leader, Liu, had no control over the situation. Recently, the Railway Bureau feared that their disputes would escalate and cause an accident. It approved the request of a third party, Sun Zhusan, to try to take responsibility for the reorganization. Just as he was about to begin, yesterday morning at 7:00 AM, the two factions of the original workers had another misunderstanding over a minor matter and started fighting on Jiaotong Road. Fortunately, it was quickly quelled. Several people on both sides were injured, but none were serious. After someone is responsible for the reorganization, the aforementioned accidents may no longer occur. It is heard that the Railway Bureau has dispatched Jiang Nan to investigate.</p>
<h3 id="e110">HUA FENG Flour Factory Workers Clash with Detectives Yesterday, Worker Liu Mingwu Injured and Life-Threatening, Western Detective Also Slightly Injured, Two Workers Arrested <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>More than 300 workers at the Huafeng Xingji Flour Factory (華豐興記　粉廠) on Xiaoshadu Road (小沙渡路) went to the home of the factory representative, Ye Shantao (葉山濤), in Zundeli (尊德里), Xiamen Road (厦門路) to petition for the resumption of work and the maintenance of food expenses. Because they did not get what they wanted, they did not disperse until yesterday (24th). The Laozha (老閘) Police Station sent a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to the scene to expel them, resulting in a conflict. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Detectives Sent to Expel: More than 300 workers at the Huafeng Xingji Flour Factory went to the home of the factory representative, Ye Shantao, at No. 47, Lane 5, Zundeli, Xiamen Road, at 9:00 AM on the 24th to petition for the resumption of work and the maintenance of food expenses. As a result, they did not get what they wanted, and they all slept in the lane until yesterday, refusing to leave. They ate pancakes for their meals. Yesterday afternoon at about 1:00 PM, a heavy rainstorm occurred, and the workers had no choice but to go to Ye Shantao's house to take shelter. Ye saw this situation and reported it to the Laozha Police Station, which sent more than 30 Chinese and Western detectives to the scene to expel them.</p>
<p>Conflict Erupts: The Laozha Police Station believed that the matter belonged to a labor strike. In order to avoid the situation from growing, it had sent more than ten Chinese and Western detectives to Zundeli to patrol in shifts, so the order was good and no incidents occurred. Until yesterday, it was reported that the workers were cooking in the lane, which could be dangerous, and they were asked to expel them. The police station sent more than 30 Chinese and Western detectives to the scene at 3:00 PM yesterday. However, the workers were determined not to leave because they were forced by livelihood and expressed that they would not give up until they achieved their goals, resulting in a conflict.</p>
<p>Injured and Arrested: The order was greatly disrupted at that time, and the intersection on Xiamen Road was blocked. As a result, one worker, Liu Mingwu (劉明武), was injured and was immediately taken to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is heard that the injury was to a vital part of the body and that his life was in danger. On the detective side, one Western head detective was also slightly injured in the head. Two workers were arrested on the spot and detained at the Laozha Police Station. The rest of the workers were completely dispersed after 2:00 PM. It is heard that the Party and government organs and the Municipal General Labor Union, considering the seriousness of the case, are actively trying to mediate in order to resolve the dispute.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Husband Abuses and Abandons, Woman Deceived into Remarriage, Woman's Circumstances Excusable, Matchmaker Cannot Be Pardoned by Law <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Acheng (朱　成), a native of Ningbo and eleven years old, lives at No. 12, Lane　, where he works as a Western food server in a foreign firm. In February of last year, he married a woman from the same hometown, Zhou Gendi (周根弟). After the marriage, their feelings were not harmonious, and Zhu often abused Zhou. Zhou had reported this to the neighborhood, but it was not accepted on the grounds of being a family dispute. Recently, Zhu has become even more abusive, not returning home for more than a month and not providing living expenses, causing the woman to go without food for two days. In addition, she is seven months pregnant. On the 15th of this month, she was crying on the road and was seen by Miao Zhangshi (妙張氏), a native of Nanjing, who took her to the home of Sun Baoshi (孫鮑氏) and Hao Xueshi (郝薛氏) at No. 6, Lane, Tangshan Road (塘山路). Seeing that Zhu abused her so much, they suggested that she find another way to make a living. Zhou, young and ignorant, agreed. Then, Sun Baoshi and others asked a man named Wei Si (魏四) to act as a matchmaker and promised Zhou to Pu Guixiang (蒲貴相), a native of Jiangbei, as his wife. At that time, it was stated that the betrothal gift was 30 yuan, and all the miscellaneous expenses totaled 120 yuan, all of which were given to Wei Si. Pu and Zhou began living together on the 21st of the month at No. 551, Tangshan Road. However, Wei Si disappeared after receiving 120 yuan, pocketing all the money and not dividing it with Sun Baoshi and others, causing Sun Baoshi and Miao Zhangshi to think of exposing the matter. They reported to Zhu Acheng the other day. Zhu reported to the Huishan Police Station, which ordered detectives Cai Liu (蔡流), Chinese detectives Yue Ma Wenda (馬文達), and others to go and arrest Zhou Gendi, Pu Guixiang, Miao Zhangshi, and Hao Xueshi. It was found that Sun Baoshi was also involved and was detained. At that time, Sun tried to bribe the detective with two yuan, but was refused. Yesterday morning, they were taken to the 5th Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police Lawyer Li Zhishan (厲志山) explained the situation and filed a lawsuit against Zhu Zhou, and Pu Guixiang according to Article 239 of the Criminal Law, and against Sun Baoshi, Miao Zhangshi, and Hao Xueshi according to Article 231 of the Criminal Law. According to the same law, Article 122, Section 3, Sun Baoshi was also charged. After Judge Rong Duo (榮鐸) questioned each defendant one by one, the defendants all admitted to the above facts. Police Lawyer Li pleaded that Zhu Zhou's crime was due to her husband's abuse, and that she was fooled by others due to her ignorance, which was excusable. He requested that the law be applied fairly. It was obvious that Pu Guixiang saw that Zhu Zhou was pregnant and was a married woman, so he requested that the law punish him. The crimes of the remaining three defendants have been proven, so please punish them severely. The court reviewed the case and ordered a sentence to be announced at a later date. Pu Guixiang was allowed bail of 100 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Dispute Over Real Estate Mortgage Agency Rights: Zhang Danru Sues, Stock Exchange Refuses to Acknowledge, Court Orders Further Investigation and Resumes Hearing <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Moli Shi (莫理十) and others, members of the estate management committee of British citizen Leishide (雷士德), alleged that Zhang Danru (張澹如), formerly entrusted by the Shanghai Securities and Commodities Exchange (上海證券物品交易所) as a representative and guaranteed by Xue Zhusun (薛竹蓀), mortgaged six English registered title deeds of the exchange for more than 2.8 million national currency, but neither redeemed them nor paid interest. Therefore, they hired lawyer Xu Shihao (徐士浩) to file a lawsuit against Xue and Zhang. When the First Special District Court opened the court, the exchange sent a lawyer to deny that Zhang Danru had the right to represent the exchange in the mortgage increase in September of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933). Zhang, on the other hand, claimed that he had the right to represent the exchange in all mortgages. Therefore, Zhang hired lawyer Wu Zhengxue (吳正矱) to file a lawsuit against the Shanghai Securities and Commodities Exchange to confirm his agency rights. Yesterday morning, Judge Mo Runhua (莫潤華) of the First Special District Court opened the court to hear the case. First, Wu Zhengxue, the plaintiff's agent, stated the purpose of the lawsuit, saying that in the 13th year of the Republic (1924), the exchange entrusted the plaintiff Zhang Danru to mortgage five English registered title deeds, totaling more than ten mu of land, to Englishman Leishide for 400,000 taels of silver. Subsequently, the redemption period was repeatedly extended and the mortgage was increased several times to 850,000 taels. Zhang obtained the exchange's letter of appointment as representative for the mortgage in the 18th year of the Republic (1929). Later, the exchange wanted to buy the neighboring land belonging to the English Registered No. 17, and the owner was surnamed Chen. Fearing that Chen would store goods, they asked Zhang Danru to instruct others to come forward and buy the land, which was sold for more than 10,000 taels of silver. It was then mortgaged to the Zhenye Banking Group for more than 300,000 yuan. On September 16 of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), Zhang, because the exchange's mortgage of the land to Leishide was due to be redeemed, negotiated with the Leishide Estate Management Committee to extend the term. At the same time, he still represented the company in mortgaging the title deed of No. 17, which was subject to the Zhenye Banking Group, for 450,000 yuan. However, this mortgage act was not recorded in the letter of representation that the exchange had given to the plaintiff at that time. However, the money mortgaged had been given to the exchange, and there was no objection at first. Now that the exchange suddenly raised a dispute over the limits of representation after being sued by the mortgagee, he filed a lawsuit for confirmation. The defendant, the Shanghai Securities and Commodities Exchange, through its legal representative, Yu Qiaqing (虞洽卿), the chairman of the exchange, hired lawyer Zhang Zheng (張正) to appear in court and claim that the defendant only knew that the title deed of No. 17 was mortgaged to the Zhenye Banking Group, and the 400,000 yuan mortgaged was also drawn from the group in installments. They did not entrust the plaintiff to mortgage to the Leishide Estate Management Committee, so they could not admit that he also had the right to represent the mortgage. Judge Mo ordered further investigation of the case and scheduled another hearing for a later date.</p>

<p>The Su-Hu Highway (蘇滬公路) has been selling tickets and operating since the Su-Kun section (蘇昆段) opened on the 11th of this month, which has been half a month. The highway was jointly built by the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department, with a total length of 90 kilometers and a construction cost of 800,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, at 3:00 PM the other day (24th), more than 50 road construction workers suddenly excavated and destroyed six or seven feet of the road surface near Lujiabang (陸家浜), with a depth of five or six feet, causing all cars traveling from Shanghai to be blocked at that location. It is heard that the reason for the destruction was that the construction costs had not been paid.</p>

<p>The Vienna Ballroom (維也納舞廳) recently held a so-called "Oriental Standard Beauty Xu Lai Coronation Ceremony." The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs believes that the name of the event is improper, the wording of its public announcement is absurd, and it is suspected of collecting money under false pretenses and obstructing public morals. At a time when the New Life Movement is being vigorously promoted, such strange phenomena should not be allowed to be promoted in Shanghai, which is related to international perception. Therefore, the bureau immediately ordered the preparatory committee to stop holding the ceremony and notified the newspapers not to publish advertisements or publicity for the coronation ceremony to avoid attracting attention. Unexpectedly, the preparatory committee dared to disregard the government order and proceeded with the ceremony as usual. Afterwards, it published a thank-you advertisement with absurd wording, almost forgetting that they were citizens of the Republic of China and must abide by Chinese laws. It is heard that the Bureau of Social Affairs will severely punish this case to deter others. It has now scheduled to summon the preparatory members Xu Shanhong (徐善宏), Shen Congshan (沈從善), etc. to the bureau for questioning and to conduct a thorough investigation.</p>

The president of the Catholic Child Welfare Association, Kong Xiangxi (孔祥熙), and his wife also sent staff to present flowers as a tribute. Mrs. Robert Chi was accompanied by her daughter, Miss Robert Chi. Although they were tired from the long journey, they were in high spirits and frequently showed joy. After Mrs. Robert Chi disembarked, she was accompanied by Xu Jianping and others to rest at the Cathay Hotel (華懋飯店). Xu had consulted with her on the inspection program for her stay in Shanghai for several days.

<p>The Tobacco Exchange Industry Association of this city, regarding the French Municipal Council's increase in the tax on tobacco exchanges within the concession, was again requested yesterday by members Yingchang, Henghexing, Guangda, Qianruihe, Ruitai, Ruidayong, Xiexingtai, Yongtai, Changfeng, and other firms to petition the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for reasonable negotiations. The association then dispatched committee member Zhang Songji to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce with a document. Secretary Yan Esheng and Zhu Boyuan received him, immediately explaining the details and submitting thirty-five receipts for the increased taxes, requesting that the Chamber of Commerce provide evidence so that the increased amount could be corrected and deducted. The request was agreed to be forwarded. The original letter is recorded as follows: Respectfully, yesterday we received your association's general letter No. 3005, stating that on the 22nd of this month, we received a letter from the French Concession Municipal Council, translated as follows: "We received your association's two letters of July 25th and August 9th, stating that the tobacco exchange members of this city are experiencing operational difficulties and have no profit to gain. You have specially requested that the increase in the tobacco exchange tax be waived to alleviate the commercial burden, etc. We have reviewed and understand this. It has been verified that each tobacco exchange shop in our concession has been paying a monthly tax of 2.8 yuan. The current characteristic levy of 5.6 yuan is due to the combined collection of tobacco and exchange taxes. The amount of various taxes stipulated by our council is quite reasonable and cannot be changed at any time. We hereby respond to your inquiry." After careful consideration of the meaning of the French Concession Municipal Council's statement that "each tobacco exchange shop has been paying a monthly tax of 2.8 yuan, and the current characteristic levy of 5.6 yuan is due to the combined collection of tobacco and exchange taxes. The amount of various taxes stipulated by our council is quite reasonable and cannot be changed at any time," there is no reason for the increase in the tax. However, according to the evidence presented by the members, the tax has indeed been doubled since June. Based on the above facts, whether there was an error in the procedures of the collection personnel, we specially submit the evidence, earnestly requesting your association to examine it and promptly issue a letter to the French Concession Municipal Council to immediately correct it, in order to show compassion for the market and eliminate disputes. It is also requested that the increased amount be clarified and deducted on a monthly basis to avoid misunderstandings and alleviate the commercial burden. We are extremely grateful.</p>

<p>At 2:30 PM the day before yesterday, a Mrs. Wang of No. 53 Haining Road was robbed of a gold ring worth more than ten yuan and fled. The Chinese and Western detectives of the Jiaxing Road Police Station arrested the perpetrators Ren Jingchu, Yang Fulin, Li Mingsheng, and the suspect Jiang Dingxiu, totaling four people. A fake handgun was found and taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Lawyer Wang Yaotang of the Public Works Department stated the previous situation, also stating that these people also used a fake handgun to rob the property of a resident at No. 421 Zhaofeng Road at 10:10 AM on the 4th of this month.

<h3 id="e123">Wife Withdraws Adultery Lawsuit; Yang Gengquan Already Divorced from His Wife Out of Court <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Yang Gengquan, a local resident and chauffeur, 34 years old this year, married a Jin woman (named Meiyu, 32 years old this year) through a matchmaker thirteen years ago. They lived together in Xiaoliang Road, Yangshupu, and had two children. Recently, Yang began an affair with a Wu woman (32 years old this year) from another place and lived together in the French Concession at No. 227 Taiside Lang Road. Wu originally had a husband surnamed Yu, but he was weak and didn't interfere. After Yang began living with Wu, he neglected his legal wife, Jin. Jin finally found out about her husband's affair and the location where he was living with Wu. Unable to bear it any longer, she went to catch them in the act at midnight on the 21st of this month, dragging her husband and Wu to the French police station to file a lawsuit, requesting investigation and punishment. The police station detained Yang and Wu and escorted them to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court the next day. Because the Police Department requested a postponement of the investigation, it was ordered that the two defendants each pay a 500-yuan bail and be available for questioning at any time. This has already been reported in this newspaper. According to the Second Special District Court, this is the first case of a wife catching her husband in adultery since the new criminal law took effect on July 1st. Article 239 of the criminal law on offenses against marriage and family states that "a person who has a spouse and commits adultery with another shall be sentenced to imprisonment for up to one year. The adulterer shall be punished in the same manner." This case was continued yesterday morning at 10:00 AM in the Eighth Criminal Court by Judge Chen Pusheng and Clerk Shen Jikui of the Second Special District Court. The defendants Yang Gengquan and Wu Xuezhen were not present. Lawyer Yao Zhaodi of the Police Department stated the results of the police station's investigation and prosecuted them for adultery. The plaintiff Yang Jin also arrived in court, submitting a petition to withdraw the lawsuit. The judge then questioned Jin, asking if she really wanted to withdraw the lawsuit. She nodded in affirmation. The court verified the statement and immediately ruled that the public prosecution in this case was not accepted. According to Article 239 of the criminal law, adultery is a case that can only be prosecuted upon accusation. The plaintiff can withdraw her lawsuit before the conclusion of the first instance debate. It is also known that the plaintiff in this case, Yang Jin, and the first defendant in this case, Yang Gengquan, have already had their relatives and friends mediate, and the two parties have agreed to divorce, allowing each to remarry freely. They have already signed a divorce agreement. Therefore, Yang Jin withdrew the lawsuit, and this amusing story of a wife catching her husband in adultery came to an end.</p>

<p>On the 9th of this month, the home of Wu Yu in Yangjing Town, Pudong, was suddenly invaded by many robbers armed with weapons, who robbed clothes and decorations. Before leaving, they shot and killed Wu Yu. Upon hearing the alarm, the Public Security Bureau in charge began investigating and successively arrested nine suspects in Pudong: Liu Decai, Liu Xiaosizi, Ma Acai, Xu Zhiquan, Ding Er, Liu Shanping, Jiang Zhenhai, Cao Shanwen, and Xu Genbao. A Dimeng brand handgun and five bullets were found in a shed in Caonitang and taken back to the Public Security Bureau for detention. However, this news was discovered by the Gordon Road Police Station of the Public Concession, because Liu Decai and the others had also committed robbery and other crimes within the concession. Therefore, the Chinese detective Zhang Liang and a Western detective were dispatched to the Public Security Bureau the day before yesterday to negotiate, and they were allowed to transfer the nine people and the guns and bullets to the police station for detention. They were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Police Lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case and requested permission for detention for investigation. According to Lawyer Zhang, the defendants in this case were arrested for robbery and homicide in Pudong, and the police station requested their transfer from the Public Security Bureau. After investigation, it was learned that they were also related to the Changping Road robbery case. It turned out that at 8:00 PM on the 6th of this month, the home of a Liang family resident at No. 27, Lane 88, Changping Road, was suddenly invaded by many robbers armed with weapons, who asked if this was the home of a Liang. At that time, Liang was outside enjoying the cool air. Seeing the situation, he knew they were not good people and shouted loudly. The robbers panicked. Moreover, the Liang family was not wealthy, so they only robbed three quilts. Just as they were about to flee, Wang Chengbin, a neighbor at No. 25, heard the alarm and opened the door to look. The robbers, fearing that he would be detrimental to them, took preemptive action and fired two shots at him. One bullet hit Wang's left leg, causing him to fall to the ground injured. The robbers then fled with the stolen goods. Wang was sent to Shilong Hospital, where Dr. Feng confirmed that his left leg bone was broken, so he is still hospitalized for treatment. After the incident, the police went to investigate and found two bullet casings in Wang's home, which they took for investigation. Now, the police have sent the handgun found in the possession of the defendants to the Shanghai Municipal Council Firearms Inspection Office. The results of the inspection confirm that it is the same handgun used to shoot Wang Chengbin on Changping Road, and the bullet casings are the same. As the investigation procedures are not yet complete, a detention is requested. Furthermore, Western Detective Ya Kelai of the Shanghai Municipal Council Firearms Inspection Office testified about the handgun inspection, presenting photos of the bullet casings. After Judge Liu Yugui briefly questioned Liu Decai and others, he ordered them to be detained for seven days for further questioning.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Sixth National Games Announcement: Women's Outdoor Base Ball Rules, Competition Summary <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Women's base ball is a game played by two teams, each with nine players, playing seven innings each. When one team is at bat, the other team fields. This alternates, with each team batting once, which constitutes one inning. The batting team's players should try to become runners, circling each base and returning to home base to score points. The fielding team's main goal is to prevent the opposing team from occupying bases and scoring. After all innings are completed, the scores of both teams are calculated, and the team with the higher score wins.</p>
<p>Article 1: Equipment</p>
<p>A. Field</p>
<p>Size of each side of the field, pitching distance, diagonal distance:</p>
<p>(1) 35 feet, 30 feet, 49.5 feet</p>
<p>(2) 45 feet, 35 feet, 63 feet</p>
<p>(3) 60 feet, ×36 feet, 84.8 feet</p>
<p>(4) 65 feet, 40 feet, 92 feet</p>
<p>×For younger female players, the pitching distance for a 60-foot field can be changed to 33 feet.</p>
<p>(Note): The Sixth National Games will temporarily use a 35-foot field, but the ball used will have a circumference of 12 inches.</p>
<p>Section 2: Home Base. Home base is made of white rubber or painted wood, in a pentagonal shape, firmly buried in the ground, with its surface level with the ground. The two sides of its pointed end match the angles of the first and third base lines, each 12 inches long. The two sides of the flat end run parallel to the straight line between home base and second base, each 8.5 inches long. The flat end connecting these two sides, which is the front of home base, should be 17 inches long.</p>
<p>Section 3: First, Second, and Third Bases. These three bases are all made of 15-inch square white canvas bags, filled with soft materials such as sawdust and yellow sand. Each base should be placed at each corner of the field, with its two sides aligned with the base lines.</p>
<p>Section 4: Pitching Plate. The pitching plate is a rectangular board, 24 inches long and 6 inches wide, buried level with the ground. The ground within the field can be sloped with the pitching plate as the center, but the height of the plate must not exceed 10 inches above each base line or home base.</p>
<p>Section 5: Batting Area. There are two batting areas, located on the left and right sides of home base, each forming a rectangle of 5 feet long and 3 feet wide. The longest side runs parallel to the diagonal line between home base and second base. If the lead line at the 12-inch point of the home base's pointed end is taken as the standard, then 2 feet of the batting area is in front of this line (i.e., inside the field), and 3 feet is behind it. The distance between the two rectangles is 29 inches, and each inner side is 6 inches from home base.</p>
<p>Section 6: Boundary Lines. The base lines between home base and first base, and between home base and third base, extend from each base to the boundary of the field, and are called boundary lines.</p>
<p>Section 7: Coaching Lines. Coaching lines run parallel to the lines between home base and second base, and between home base and third base, each 6 feet outside the base lines, starting from the intersection of the base lines and extending towards home base, to a length of 15 feet.</p>
<p>B. Ball</p>
<p>The ball should be an official playground ball, with three circumferences: 14 inches, 12 inches, and 9 inches, depending on the size of the field (see Article 1, Section A, Table). The weight of the 12-inch ball should be between 5 and three-quarters ounces and 6 and a half ounces.</p>
<p>C. Bat</p>
<p>The bat is round, with the diameter at its thickest point not exceeding 2.5 inches, and its length not exceeding 34 inches. There are no restrictions on the bat's weight or the type of wood used.</p>
<p>D. Player Equipment</p>
<p>If using a 65-foot field, fielders may use gloves.</p>
<p>(Note): According to the Rules Committee, catchers should use masks and chest protectors.</p>
<p>Article 2: Game Terminology</p>
<p>Section 1: Obstruction. If a batted or thrown ball is touched, obstructed, or caught by someone not participating in the game, it is called "obstruction."</p>
<p>Section 2: Coach. A player listed in the batting order who stands within the coaching line's range when their team is at bat, providing guidance to their teammates who are running bases, is called a "coach."</p>
<p>Section 3: Fielder. Any member of the fielding team participating in the game on the field is called a "fielder."</p>
<p>Section 4: Fly Ball. A ball that is caught before it touches the ground after being hit is called a "fly ball."</p>
<p>Section 5: Forced Out. A "forced out" occurs when a batter becomes a runner, and a runner already on base is forced to advance to the next base, losing their right to continue occupying that base, and is therefore out.</p>
<p>Section 6: Inning. An "inning" refers to the instance when a team is at bat until three of its players are out.</p>
<p>Section 7: Infield. The area of the field within the four base lines is called the "infield."</p>

<p>Section 10: Passed Ball. A legally pitched ball that is not touched by the bat, and the catcher fails to catch or control it, is called a "passed ball."</p>
<p>Section 11: Play. "Play" is the command given by the umpire to officially start or resume the game after a timeout.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Qingdao City: Universal Compulsory Education Plan, Stipulating Compulsory Enrollment Measures, Total Annual Funding of 85,000 Yuan <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The Municipal Education Bureau, following orders to implement universal compulsory education, has drafted a "Twenty-Fourth Year Implementation Plan for Promoting Compulsory Education." This plan has been submitted to the Ministry of Education and the Municipal Government for approval and implementation. The total annual funding is 85,000 yuan. The bureau's proposed universal compulsory education plan and compulsory enrollment measures are detailed below:</p>
<p>Universal Compulsory Education Plan</p>
<p>The "Measures for Implementing Compulsory Education in the City in the Twenty-Fourth Year" had previously been drafted and submitted to the Ministry of Education for record. The points listed in that plan were based on the principles and regulations for promoting compulsory education in the city. Now, with the budget finalized and all surveys completed, a detailed plan has been formulated as a basis for implementation. However, there are two differences between this plan and the previously submitted one: 1. The number of classes added has been reduced. The previous plan proposed 350 classes, while this plan specifies 311 classes. 2. The total funding has been slightly reduced. The previous plan proposed over 96,000 yuan, but the actual allocation in this plan is only 85,000 yuan. The bureau's original submission anticipated an annual subsidy of over 48,000 yuan from the Ministry of Education, with the same amount raised locally. Therefore, the original plan could add up to 350 classes. However, the ministry's approved subsidy for this year is 22,000 yuan, which is over 16,000 yuan less than expected. It is extremely difficult to raise additional funds locally, so it is necessary to reduce the number of classes to balance the budget. The actual amount of funds raised locally is over 53,000 yuan, which is over 5,000 yuan more than the original amount (48,000 yuan). The total funding, including the Ministry of Education subsidy and local funds, is 85,000 yuan. It is planned to allocate 55,000 yuan for the expenses of opening and reforming classes, 16,000 yuan for construction costs, and 14,000 yuan for initial equipment costs. According to actual calculations, it is possible to add or reform classes to include 24 regular classes, 40 new two-shift classes, and 178 reformed two-shift classes. Education in this city has always been considered widespread, with schools in all rural areas. The best way to implement universal compulsory education is to utilize existing school buildings and classes to operate two-shift classes. However, because classrooms in all schools are already full of students and there are no spare rooms for students in the two shifts to share, it is proposed to adopt a half-day two-shift system for ease of management and instruction. If schools can find a way to adopt a full-day teaching schedule, they can apply to do so. The duration of study in the two-shift classes is tentatively set at two years, equivalent to the level of the first two years of elementary school. School-age children who complete two years of study will be issued a certificate of completion of compulsory education. If they wish to continue their studies, they can still enter the third grade. Implementing the program in this way can utilize existing schools to popularize compulsory education and preserve regular elementary schools, so that universal compulsory education will not come at the expense of regular elementary schools, thereby affecting the level of education. B. Compulsory Education Funding: 1. Sources of Funding: (1) 53,000 yuan from the Municipal Government's treasury; (2) 32,000 yuan in subsidies from the Ministry of Education; totaling 85,000 yuan. 2. Allocation of Funding: (1) 16,000 yuan in subsidies for school building construction; (2) 14,000 yuan for start-up costs; (3) 55,000 yuan for the annual operating expenses of establishing new schools, adding classes, and reforming existing classes. 3. Standards for the allocation of operating expenses: (1) The funding for adding regular senior classes to municipal, township, and district elementary schools will be handled according to the existing standards, i.e., one and a half teachers will be added for each senior class, with a monthly salary of 34 yuan. One and a quarter teachers will be added for each junior class, with a monthly salary of 31 yuan. Office expenses will be determined based on the number of classes, ranging from six to nine yuan per class. (2) One teacher will be added for each two-shift class in municipal elementary schools, with a monthly salary of 34 yuan. Office expenses will be calculated according to standards. (3) One teacher will be added for every two two-shift classes in township elementary schools, with a monthly salary of 31 yuan and office expenses of 5 yuan. (4) For each two-shift class reformed in township elementary schools, the salary of teachers in full elementary schools or branch schools will be increased by three yuan. If it is in a junior elementary school, one teacher will be added for each reformed class, with a monthly salary of 28 yuan. (5) For schools established in newly designated districts, the monthly salary of the principal of a full elementary school will be 36 yuan, the principal of a junior elementary school will be 33 yuan, senior teachers will receive 31 yuan, junior teachers will receive 28 yuan, and office expenses will be 5 yuan per class. (6) Each newly established school and each newly added class will be given two months of winter coal expenses, at 9 yuan per month.</p>
<p>Compulsory Enrollment Measures</p>
<p>(1) These measures are formulated in accordance with Chapter 2 of the "Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Outline of the Provisional Measures for Implementing Compulsory Education" of the Central Ministry of Education. (2) All school-age children (from seven to thirteen years old) in the city's area must enroll in school to complete their compulsory national education. (3) The number of school-age children in the city's area will be investigated once a year in June by the Education Bureau in conjunction with the Public Security Bureau, under the supervision of the Municipal and Township District Offices and school police stations, as the basis for compulsory enrollment. 4. After the investigation is completed, each office will prepare statistics on school-age children in its district and submit them to the Education Bureau and the Public Security Bureau for record-keeping. The original registers will be kept in the office for future reference. 5. The period before the start of the spring and autumn semesters of elementary schools each year will be the period for compulsory enrollment. In addition to schools recruiting students on their own and filling vacancies, if there are insufficient places, the school should report to the district office, which will investigate the school-age children's register, select those who are older and from wealthier families, compile a list, and have the office send it to the district's Public Security Bureau to urge them to enroll. 6. If all school-age children who are older and from wealthier families have been enrolled, and there are still insufficient places, they should be filled with children from poor families. The office will also compile a list and send it to the Public Security Bureau to strictly urge them to enroll. 7. For children who have been urged to enroll by the Public Security Bureau, the principal will report to the nearby police station and give their parents a verbal warning. If they still do not enroll after two days of warning, the principal should report to the office, which will impose a fine of between one and five yuan. 8. The above fines will be handled by the office. The fine notice will be forwarded to the Public Security Bureau for delivery to the police station for enforcement. 9. The police station should enforce the collection of fines within six hours after the fine notice is delivered. Even if the parents verbally agree to pay or rush to send their children to school, they will still be fined. Those who refuse to pay the fine may be temporarily detained. 10. The receipt for the fine will be prepared by the Education Bureau in triplicate with an official seal and sent to the Public Security Bureau for distribution and use. 11. The triplicate receipt for the fine will have the first copy for record-keeping, the second copy for verification, and the third copy as a receipt, which will be issued to the fined household after the fine is paid in full. 12. At the end of each month, the police station will verify the second copy of the fine receipt and send it to the branch station, which will submit it to the Public Security Bureau for forwarding to the office to verify the amount of the fine. The office will then issue a list and send it to the Education Bureau for safekeeping. The first copy of the record will remain with the police station. 13. The fine money will be used by the Education Bureau for the benefit of the school to which the fined household belongs, in the following ways: (1) To enrich equipment, (2) To subsidize the cost of books for poor students. 14. The parents who have been fined must still send their children to school within three days. If they still do not comply, they may be fined twice the amount of the first fine, and the above procedures will still be followed. 15. If a school-age child drops out of school for no reason or is absent for more than one week, and repeated requests for them to return to school are ignored, the principal may report to the office, which may impose a fine of between one and five yuan and still order them to return to school. 16. If a student withdraws from school due to a family move within the city, the school must verify the new address, report it to the police station, and the police station will notify the police station in that area to urge them to enroll. 17. If a school-age child has an epidemic or other reason and cannot attend school for a while, their parents or guardians may submit a written request for exemption from school. Those with chronic illnesses or idiocy who are incapable of receiving education may have their parents or guardians request exemption from school. All applications for delayed schooling or exemption from schooling must be approved by the office to be valid. Each office must also submit a separate report. 19. The term of the first phase of compulsory education in the city is tentatively set at two years, using a two-shift teaching system. Students who have completed two years of education will have the school apply to the Education Bureau for a certificate of short-term compulsory education. Continued education is permitted. 20. During the first two phases of compulsory education implementation, if school-age children have been educated in private schools or at home and pass the assessment of the local elementary school, they will be given a certificate of short-term compulsory education. If they do not pass, they must still enroll in school. 21. These measures may be amended at any time if there are any omissions. 22. These measures will be implemented from the date of submission and approval.</p>

<p>—Original work by Ms. Louisa May Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang (Zonghai)</p>
<p>Chapter 3: The Path of Light</p>
<p>When Ned walked into the classroom on Monday morning, he was not without fear in his heart, because he was deeply afraid of exposing his stupidity to the public. However, Mr. Pei deliberately placed him in a seat deep in the recess by the window, with his back to the others, and sent Fang Lang to guide him in his studies, so no one else would hear his mistakes or see the mess of ink on his writing book. He was truly grateful for this situation and worked very hard. Later, Mr. Pei saw his hot face and black fingers and said with a smile:</p>
<p>"Don't work too hard, my child; if you're afraid of getting tired, you can do it a little more leisurely."</p>
<p>"But I have to work hard, otherwise I won't be able to catch up with others. They know a lot of things, and I don't know anything," Ned said, truly falling into a state of despair. Hearing the other children answer questions about history, geography, and grammar, he felt that they were extremely familiar.</p>
<p>"But you also know many things that they don't know," Mr. Pei said, sitting next to him, as Fang Lang had gone to lead a group of young students through the maze of the tax law's multiplication table. "Really?" Ned looked, seeming unable to believe what Mr. Pei had just said.</p>
<p>"Really; first of all, you can control your temper, while those who excel at solving mathematical problems often cannot; this is a very important lesson, and I think you have already learned it well. Secondly, you can play the violin, but none of the children here can, even though they all long to. But the best thing, Ned, is that you really want to learn something. With that, it's as if you're already halfway there. It may seem difficult at first, and you may feel discouraged, but just keep doing it, and then you will naturally find that everything gradually becomes easier."</p>

<p>Today is the birthday of Confucius. The celebration is more enthusiastic than in previous years, as the inauguration of the Four Sages' Sacrificial Officials is a major expression of respect for Confucius. In the past, only government agencies closed for business. This year, all banks, money houses, grain and flour businesses, and the gold, securities, yarn, and flower exchanges and markets were closed, except for foreign-owned banks, which remained open as usual, and foreign exchange rates were available.</p>

<p>Foreign Banks Reduce Activity, Standard Gold Price also Rises by 1.8 Yuan; Daily Market Conditions Shift from Firm to Flat, Demand and Supply are Unsatisfactory, and Fluctuations are Narrow</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold market saw foreign banks reducing activity and prices initially trending upward. Unexpectedly, the central bank's listed price did not change, and the standard gold price instead decreased. Buyers took advantage of this momentum to actively sell, causing prices to fall again. However, the daily market was extremely flat, and the final result was a slight improvement. In the early morning, overseas silver markets in England and America both fell, and the market showed weakness. Montry forward silver prices also fell by 1.5% to 4%. Exchange rates were slightly higher. London spot gold decreased by two pence. In off-exchange pre-market trading, prices opened and immediately rose to above 80 yuan. Hengyu Dadecheng sold from 81 yuan down to 79 yuan. Huixiang Dada Yongli Fuxing Yongheng Yuyuan came in to buy, rising back to 72 yuan. The morning opening was high, and prices remained slightly stable after opening. The Central Bank's listed prices were announced, and both England and America were flat. Customs gold units fell by four cents. The buyer's side became active, retreating to within 80 yuan, showing slight weakness. Banks traded with each other, and the foreign exchange market was still flat. Buyers took advantage of the low prices to buy, causing prices to rise again to above 80 yuan. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's listed prices were announced, and both England and America were also flat. There was still fluctuation, and short sellers covered their positions, causing prices to rise again. However, due to a lack of confidence, prices soon fell again, retreating to within 80 yuan. The foreign exchange market slightly eased and became even lower. The Hong Kong market was initially tight and then loose after opening, but the fluctuations were extremely narrow. The gold market therefore fluctuated, with few transactions and extremely mediocre activity. Unfortunately, a certain Mr. Luo from the machinery industry continued to sell, and short sellers also increased their positions, causing long positions to collapse and prices to plummet at one point. However, the foreign exchange market remained flat and easily recovered. It was predicted that Indian silver would not move. At noon, prices hovered again. In the afternoon market, the heavy rain hampered travel, and few people arrived. The market opened after 3 p.m., and prices were slightly stable after opening. However, due to traffic congestion, there was still a slight dip in US dollars. Indian silver instead reduced by four annas, and the Hong Kong market softened again. Confidence remained stable, and prices gradually rose. Chinese dollars were also congested, rising and then consolidating. Indian silver was quoted flat for the second time, and buyers continued to be eager. Prices ultimately remained firm, but there was a slight decrease after closing. The overall trend for the day was initially firm and then flat. Demand and supply were unsatisfactory, and fluctuations were very narrow. Swap premiums were also high. Yesterday, the long side posted a premium of 4.2 yuan. The daily market conditions will be reviewed later.</p>
<p>The morning opening was at 881.7 yuan, an improvement of 4.8 yuan compared to last Saturday. Yuanyi Yongli advanced to 2.3 yuan. The Central Bank's listed prices were announced, and customs gold fell by 4%. Hengyu Dadecheng Fuxing Yong took the opportunity to sell at high prices, retreating to 79.9 yuan. Yifeng Yong Yongli continued to advance to 81 yuan. Dadecheng Fuxing Yong Chunyuan Yongheng Chang Yong Dacheng sold strips, retreating to 78.3 yuan. Hengyu Fuxing Yong Yongli Fuyu continued to rise to 81 yuan. McGary sold September US dollars at 8125. Dadecheng Wanxing Fuxing Yong Jun strips, anticipating that the exchange rate would be flat for both England and America, retreated to 79 yuan.

<p>Yesterday was Monday, and the banks' clearance volume was exceptionally high as usual. Therefore, the clearance was busier than any other previous Monday. In addition, today is Confucius' birthday. According to the new rules for this year, the silver, banking and customs industries have unanimously decided to close for one day. Therefore, if the celebration and clearance could be arranged in advance, they were all expedited yesterday. However, those that could not be done due to time and circumstances would have to be accepted one day later, tomorrow (28th). Therefore, yesterday's clearance situation was more critical than any other Monday opening day. As for market transactions, foreign exchange swaps remained the same as before. The morning and afternoon markets were still at 0.15, and the situation was slightly relaxed. There were still no additional funds for overdrafts, and all were blank.

<p>Yesterday's Jiangnan small silver coins continued to decline. The morning and afternoon markets were both at 833.3 yuan, an improvement of 0.3 yuan from the noon market the day before. Trading was also scarce, with only 3,000 transactions in the morning market. The buying appetite for Guangdong small silver coins and green small silver from pawnshops was relatively high, and various routes slightly reduced their positions. Therefore, it has been increasing day by day. Yesterday it rose again by 0.5 to 0.6 yuan. The morning market was at 740 yuan, a sharp increase of 1.1 yuan from the previous noon. The afternoon market fell back by 0.5 yuan to 739.5 yuan. The result was a rise of 0.6 yuan compared to the previous noon.

<p>At the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange yesterday, the August futures contracts had already stopped trading and were left to be settled on the 29th. Only the September futures contracts were traded on the market for one month. The previous month's futures contracts would not be listed until the 30th. Trading on the market was very quiet. Each session failed to open all items, and even those that failed to open accounted for half of the sessions. If there were 50,000 to 100,000 transactions, the market price would inevitably fluctuate by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan because it was difficult for the counterparty to find a suitable buyer or seller. Since today is Confucius' birthday and the market is closed for one day, speculators were even less active. The opening session situation was that 19 Guanshan and 20 rolls failed to open, and the market price was chaotic, with highs and lows visible. The amount was extremely small, and the difference was only 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. The second session had even fewer transactions. Nos. 9, 19 of retrenchment and disarmament, and four types of Guanshan all failed to open. Salt tax transactions were more numerous, and slightly stronger by about 0.1 yuan. The afternoon opening session had more transactions, but Nos. 19 and 20 rolls were still unattended. No. 32 and No. 54 bought unified salt tax, No. 16 sold gold short, and No. 43 sold 23 customs duties. There were more transactions, and the market price was slightly better by 0.05, 0.1 to 0.35 yuan. At closing, No. 19 Guanshan, good deed, No. 20 rolls, and unified tax were all unattended. For the rest, the market price was slightly weaker by 0.05, 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. As a result, retrenchment and disarmament No. 19 Customs Duty was better by 0.05 and No. 23 Customs Duty was worse by a small 0.25. The rest were all better by 0.05 to 0.25. No. 19 Good Deed has not been opened all day. The total number of transactions was 2,257,000 yuan. The results of the increase and decrease are compared and listed on the left.

<p>The yarn market started to rise and then fell back, and the situation is still calm. This is because there have been too many dumps in recent days, and the pressure is too heavy, so the market is prone to rebound. However, the general long positions have already turned short, and the contract amount is quite large, and the front is more loose. However, the continuous decline is too drastic, and it may be stable temporarily. This month is the last two days, and the market attitude is still peaceful. The closing price of this last session was 165.6 yuan, which is 7.4 yuan lower than last month's 173 yuan.</p>
<p>This Month, Yarn Alone Fell 1 Yuan</p>
<p>Before the opening of the standard yarn market, the public expected a few corners of decline, because US cotton continued to fall, and large accounts had dumped quite fiercely the previous day. The opening session fell by 0.5.3.2 corners for near-term futures. When the market was shot up for far-term futures, it was also tight and expensive. Although a certain Xu was selling session by session, inland factories turned from short to long when prices were low, and yarn factories stopped 50% of production, and the output was reduced. In addition, the Shudu activity developed again, so confidence was still good. The market price suddenly rose in three sessions, and the result was an increase of 0.8.9 corners to 1.3 yuan for each month compared with the closing price of the previous day. However, there was no movement this month. The market attitude was still good after the afternoon opening session, because the spot yarn transactions of the noon customers were active and the popularity was still good. However, when shooting up to the closing session, the cargo receipt of this month was still short of 350 bales, and suddenly fell by 0.9 yuan, and the far-term futures were affected and brought down. As a result, near-term futures fell by 1 yuan compared with the morning closing price, and far-term futures fell by 0.4.6.7 corners. It was found that Daji sold 5,300 bales, Shenchang 1,350 bales, Shenji 950 bales, Yuanyi 700 bales, Xincheng 1,700 bales, Yida 1,450 bales, Jinchang 700 bales, and Changyu 850 bales.

<p>The cotton market in August remained strong. Today is the last day, and the market price is rising step by step, which shows the strength of the longs to squeeze the shorts. The last session price was 36 yuan, which is still 0.5 yuan higher than last month's 35.5 yuan. However, new cotton in the far month is due to the smooth weather recently, and new cotton is gradually appearing, and there are too many factories that have stopped production, and consumption is indeed reduced.</p>
<p>The month alone increased by 0.65 yuan.</p>
<p>At the opening of the standard cotton and parallel markets, August futures were still firm, saying that the longs were preparing to receive goods, so the market price was slowly rising, and the situation was very high. Far-term futures saw a slight improvement, but most cotton merchants tended to hedge their sales, because new cotton from all routes was gradually entering the market, and the harvest was still good. The market was soft. As a result, August futures increased by 0.6 yuan compared with the morning closing price, and far-term futures increased by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. The afternoon opening session August was still firm, because it was the last day, and the general floating accounts with no goods to deliver could only reluctantly cover their positions. However, new cotton was seen in the far-term futures, so the result was better than the morning closing price. Five-hundredths yuan, the far was cheaper than five-hundredths yuan. It was found that Dafeng sold 3,100 dan, Dafu 1,100 dan, Hexing 2,300 dan, Gengfeng 4,800 dan, Changfeng 1,300 dan, Yongda 7,300 dan, Xincheng 6,900 dan, Yikang 4,200 dan, Tongxing 1,200 dan, Tongji bought 2,100 dan, Changyu 1,500 dan, Yuanyi 2,000 dan, Yicheng 1,300 dan, Runkang 1,300 dan, Shengyuan 2,800 dan, Yongchang 2,200 dan, Yifeng 1,270 dan, Changfeng 1,900 dan, Yichang 1,300 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices during the day are listed below.</p>

<p>Bombay's cotton market last week was caused by the weakness of the silver market and the pessimistic US cotton lending problems. The market price fell sharply, and most of the business in the market was sold by the local gangs. Indian cotton was bought in Liverpool and New York, and spot cotton was calm, with no new transaction reports. Because the cotton market was uncertain, manufacturers were unwilling to trade. The weather continues to be smooth, and the estimated cotton harvest has an increasing trend. The statistics for the past week are attached below.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from each gang were even scarcer, only Nos. 8 and 9 arrived (a total of 1,600 to 1,700 dan). The selling side tried its best to tighten up, and the situation turned flat. As a result, the market color seemed to be settling down. If the price of late rice, except for high-grade materials, is still slightly moved by the Qingwu gang with only Bao Weiqing Wubang 300 to 400 bales, the market makers and each of the thick粳 are basically the same and there is nothing important. Du Yangjian was uniquely soft yesterday because of the poor eating. The new粳 rice was also flat, but the Zhuanqiao goods were still fresh for the first time, so the price was higher and the price opened as high as 8.7 yuan.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of each gang under the river was about the 20th. Each type of goods on the market had good retail sales in the morning market. However, because the shop's appetite turned slack, the market was at peace. Early Bo Rice retail sales were bland, and the price was weaker than corner price, and the white yuan price was set. Dongxin粳 Rice reached both sales and harmony, and the price was set. The new guest sharp price was about 0.1 yuan. The arrival of the new participation was not much, the eating was slow, and the price was smaller than 0.2 yuan. The other goods were also weaker than several cents to 0.1 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e162">The Guest Xiang Rice to the Head Gradually Surging, The Goods Arriving From Ports Such As Gan, An, And Zhe Are Endless. <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Yangjia Xiang market conditions were all weak. Because the guest Xiang early rice continued to enter the market, the producing areas shipped from one another to Shanghai because the goods were many and the prices were falling. Yesterday, in addition to the Yongjiang Anhui rice continuing to arrive, there were also early goods arriving at ports from Jiangxi Taizhou Xiashi and other places, but the routes were only one on this street. Other guest gangs and inland areas did not bother. The people's hearts were trending soft, and the vendors were anxious to sell, so the guest Xiang rice was immediately dropped by two corners. Yang rice stopped arriving later and later, and the bottom was getting thinner day by day, and they were able to stand. But they were affected by the guest Xiang rice, and the price also dropped by 0.1 yuan to 0.06 yuan. The sales openings for the whole day were 38 packages of Gan early rice, 573 packages of Yong early rice, 45 packages of Xia machine early rice, 300 packages of Taizhou early rice, and 2,000 packages of various colors of Yang rice. All of them were handled by this street.</p>

<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning and afternoon, the market conditions for each month were uniformly stagnant. The quotation for foreign wheat, Chicago fell by about 0.2 yuan, Canada fell by 0.25 cents, the market people were caused the up and down was minimal, and buyers and sellers from all sides were looking forward due to silver relations. As for the value of Tianjin spot flour, it was hovering between 0.48 and 0.49 yuan, which was more suitable compared to the market. However, the turnover was also quiet, so there was no movement. Based on the current situation, if the sales floor is still not moving for a long time, there may be less hope of going forward. The total transaction volume for the whole day was only 170,000 packages, and it is not difficult to imagine the bleakness. As a result, September, October, and November were slightly better than 0.025 yuan, December was a small 0.025 yuan, and the rest did not move.</p>
<h3 id="e164">This Wheat Does Not Shift With Environmental Changes <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market, the market atmosphere for each month during the morning opening session, was generally quiet. The quotation for foreign wheat, fell by a small 0.2 yuan. Although the market price of spot wheat abroad could not be approached, the domestic wheat market was still difficult to follow the environment and showed a slight loosening trend. Therefore, although the flour market was stagnant, the people's hearts were still able to stand firm, and there was no possibility of a large decline. The transactions in the afternoon sessions were still smooth, and the prices were hovering, with little difference. As a result, this month fell by 0.01 yuan, September fell by 0.02 yuan, October was better by 0.01 yuan, and the rest did not move. The spot wheat market was still holding on. The vendors were calling for 0.7 yuan for high-quality goods, and the factories were offering 0.67 yuan, and there was still no close approach, so there was no formal transaction.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat fell due to rainfall in Argentina and the European situation not worsening. The predicted harvest of new wheat in Argentina is not good, and the price of spot wheat in the United States is very high for futures, and it is appropriate to buy when the price is loose.</p>

<p>The bran market has become quiet. Because domestic sales routes have only sporadic, and foreign firms have not continued to handle it, the market prices support each other, with very little ups and downs. Yesterday's offers from each gear were 1.15 yuan with a deduction, and if foreign firms do not move in the future, it depends on whether the wife is stagnant or not.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Miscellaneous Grains Market: Sales Clear Both Ways <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the miscellaneous grains market experienced sluggish trading due to the Kongzi (Confucius) birthday holiday, with customs and the entire city closed, resulting in scarce buying and selling. Only a few transactions occurred, and overall, there were no significant price fluctuations. New beans showed a mixed trend, with gains being outweighed by losses. Although the outflow of Changzhou oxhide yellow beans was steady, large arrivals led to weak sales, and market sentiment softened. Jiujiang beans, particularly Red Bridge beans, were scarce and prices were firm. Chengyao (City Gate) beans were pressured by oxhide yellow beans, placing them lower in the market. Yesterday, over three hundred packages of oxhide yellow beans opened, with prices ranging from three yuan, six jiao, two fen to four jiao, five fen. Six hundred packages of Chengyao beans opened, with prices ranging from three yuan, six jiao to five jiao, three fen. Market conditions generally showed adjustments of four fen and nine li (thousandths of a yuan), and other amounts.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Show Little Fluctuation <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was flat, with little fluctuation and few transactions. The guild's fixed price for No. 1 raw sugar (coarse white) spot goods was seventeen yuan per jiao (tenth of a yuan), and for re-export goods, five yuan, three jiao, five fen, but neither were transacted. Taikoo Sugar's "B" mark was priced at the original level, but also lacked buyers. The local factory's refined white sugar, Zhenyu No. 1, was sixteen yuan, three jiao, five fen, firm five fen. No. 2, one jiao, five fen. No. 3, one jiao. No. 4, fifteen yuan, nine jiao, five fen. The cooperative company tendered 1,963 pieces of Huizhou coarse white sugar, at sixteen yuan, four jiao, five fen, selling 100 bags. 1,000 bags of Guangdong medium white sugar, selling 100 bags. 2,000 bags of thin coarse white, seventeen yuan, two jiao, selling 30 bags. Other grades of goods only had offered prices and no completed transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e168">North-South Goods: Glutinous Rice Branches Exceedingly Expensive <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Cantonese glutinous rice branches (nuomizhizhi) and Jinshan branches, due to poor harvests of new goods this year, are not being shipped. Therefore, the asking prices for existing old goods are rising daily. Recently, five or six hundred boxes were traded. Cold storage goods are offered as high as fifty-four yuan for tall branches, and seventy-eight yuan for tall flat branches, with others priced accordingly. As production of glutinous rice branches this year is limited, barely enough for direct consumption, if used for baking, even six hundred yuan could not secure goods. Consequently, old goods are firm and extremely expensive, offered sporadically at two hundred yuan, still much cheaper than new goods.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Metals: Black Iron Sheet Offered at Eight Yuan <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Since the price increase of black iron sheet, procurement by various parties remains enthusiastic. Consequently, recent transactions still amounted to six or seven hundred dan (a unit of weight). The offered price has risen to eight yuan. However, end-users have not reduced their demand due to the higher price, and market conditions are very good. However, as arrivals are not keeping up and stocks are thin, a continued rise in market prices is expected. However, occasional shortages are also unavoidable.</p>

<p>Since 35-pound "Sea Horse" mouth iron (薄馬鐵烟公司) was collected by tobacco companies from Nanyang (Southeast Asia) and elsewhere, the market has experienced shortages. The standard price is offered as high as fifty-two or fifty-three yuan per box. However, investigations reveal that few holders are willing to sell, so sentiment is particularly firm. Market sources indicate that they are unwilling to sell below fifty-five yuan, making the outlook very optimistic.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the green tea market became increasingly quiet. Excluding Baocheng and Tianxiang firms, which slightly replenished their stock of Luzhuang Zhenmei green tea, others mostly took a wait-and-see approach. Due to the urgency of the conflict in the Philippines, Ping Shui Zhenmei was completely ignored. However, Zhucha (pearl tea) sales to the United States were still good, but market stocks were low and there were no large-scale transactions. As for the black tea market, stocks of high-grade Qimen and Ningzhou goods have been largely cleared. Goods from Hunan and Hubei provinces, since the establishment of Russian firms in Hankou, have not been shipped to Shanghai for sale. Low-grade and substandard goods are also largely unsuitable for sales, resulting in a complete halt to black tea transactions.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Memories of Sacrificing to Confucius <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Li Qing</p>
<p>Since the fifteenth year of the Republic, the grand ceremony of sacrificing to Confucius has long been abolished. Last year, the National Government designated August 27th, Confucius' birthday, as a National Memorial Day, ordering all agencies and organizations to take a holiday for commemoration and to hold solemn memorial ceremonies. Although the rituals differ from the past, they evoked my early memories of participating in the sacrifices to Confucius, which I write about haphazardly for the reader.</p>
<p>The Liyan Academy in Jiangyin was originally connected to the Wenmiao (Confucius Temple). Since the Xinhai Revolution, the academy was converted into a school, and the buildings were separated. I studied at Liyan in the past and was twice selected as a dancer. According to the ritual, sacrifices to Confucius required seventy-two dancers and twenty-four musicians, collectively known as the "music and dance performers." The musicians, under the direction of experienced individuals, sang verses from the Book of Great Harmony, while the dancers, holding shields in their left hands and halberds in their right hands, advanced, retreated, knelt, and prostrated themselves, which Confucius would appreciate.</p>
<p>We rose at midnight, ate the thin rice porridge prepared in the school, then donned green silk ceremonial robes similar to Daoist robes and square scholar hats. We marched in formation to the Wenmiao, prepared to participate in the ceremony. The ceremony was scheduled for 2:00 AM, but the chief officiant was often a lazy opium addict, and by the time he arrived at the temple, it was usually dawn. During that prolonged time, we wandered around, admiring the display of the "tailao" (full offering of ox, sheep, pig) and "shaolao" (smaller offering) on large platters. I wondered why Confucius and his disciples insisted on eating whole oxen and sheep, leaving people with a crude impression.</p>
<p>Once the sacrificial ritual began, experts like literati leisurely struck various ancient bronze blocks. Although it was ancient music, the sound resembled the "cacophony of clay pots" as described, and those with some musical knowledge could not sense its beauty. As for the carving of patterns on some bronze blocks, they did possess artistic merit.</p>
<p>Everyone participating in the ceremony received compensation. For the music and dance performers, there were two legs of beef and one sheep. The musicians received twenty-four steamed buns, and the dancers received sixteen steamed buns. Besides the beef and sheep given directly, the steamed buns were distributed in the form of tickets. Each ticket was for four buns, and the ticket holder could exchange it at the designated steamed bun shop. However, for students with "face," being selected was perhaps worse than not being selected, because after being selected, one had to give one or two tickets to friends who were not selected. One could, at most, enjoy three tickets, i.e., twelve buns. Those not selected, on the other hand, could obtain seven or eight tickets by begging and asking, exceeding the dancers' share by one hundred percent. These people who gained without labor, of course, were limited to the special class of students.</p>

<p>He called the tea boy and said sternly: Secretary-General Qiu, who came with Commissioner Lan this time, is a relative of mine. Here's a letter, you must deliver it to him. Speaking, he handed the letter to the tea boy, and at the same time took a copper ticket worth twenty copper coins and gave it to him, smiling: This is for you to buy a pack of cigarettes. But there's one thing, you must deliver this letter to Secretary-General Qiu's hand. He's a very modest person and doesn't want people to call him Secretary-General, just call him Secretary. Secretary doesn't sound very good, so just call him Mr. Qiu. Isn't that what they call those high-ranking central officials, Mr.? The tea boy smiled faintly, threw the copper ticket on the table, and said: I have cigarettes to smoke, I don't need your money. Saying that, he took the letter and walked out. Zhang Jiefu chased him outside, shouting: This letter is very important, you must deliver it to Mr. Qiu's hand. That tea boy did not turn his head back, and kept walking forward with the letter. Jiefu stood blankly on the corridor, very regretful, thinking in his heart, if he gave him ten cents, he might be happy. Now that he had been generous, he should have been generous to the end, but now saving twenty or thirty copper coins, he was afraid it would hinder his business. Just as he was thinking so, Li Shilian came out of the room from afar and bowed deeply to Jiefu. He smiled and said: Congratulations, congratulations. Jiefu was thinking about things, and was suddenly congratulated by him, but he was a little confused, widened his eyes, and kept looking at him. Li Shilian smiled and said: That Commissioner Lan is here, you can find a position, isn't this a happy event? (300)</p>

<p>— Zhang Muliang</p>
<p>In the Hongkou area, as long as you mention the name "Tofu Xi Shi," everyone, young and old, knows who you're talking about.</p>
<p>Tofu Xi Shi's real name is unknown, but it's known that her family runs a tofu shop. Because she has a very likable face, people gave her this elegant nickname. She has studied the art of dealing with people in daily life very well. In front of old ladies, she speaks of the boundless Buddhist Dharma; in front of old men, she laments the hardships of the world; such handling of people makes people feel very comfortable. Moreover, her nimble mouth always addresses people with such endearing terms as "Uncle," "Elder Brother," "Auntie," "Good Granny"...!</p>
<p>But recently, Tofu Xi Shi has started to dress up in flamboyant ways, learning to be beautiful, and she has also put on airs when dealing with people.</p>
<p>Whenever she dresses up and goes out, those nosy neighbors will tease her, saying, "Oh dear! The fashionable elder sister is here!" But as soon as she hears such teasing, she puts on a widow-like face, acting as if something important has happened, and ignores you. Because of this, people began to suspect that she might be up to something outside.</p>
<p>About a few months later, it was said that Tofu Xi Shi no longer dressed up flamboyantly to go out, and stayed at home all day long.</p>
<p>"Alas! What a beautiful young girl has died!" The good granny next door to Tofu Xi Shi came to tell people.</p>
<p>Later, everyone understood that she had died from an abortion, a very tragic ending that made them only lament for her!</p>
<p>So in the Hongkou area, no one heard her beautiful name anymore!</p>

<p>So I tried to explain the materials, usage, and preparation of French hair dye to her to the best of my limited knowledge. However, my own knowledge of cosmetics was too little and I couldn't explain it clearly to her. She was very understanding, and dropped the subject after hearing it. However, I was clear on the effects of hair dye, so I was able to explain that point clearly to her. As a result, I persuaded her very hard.</p>
<p>"I'll write to France to order it," I finally said, "and then have them send the medicine from France. It will take at least forty or fifty days for the whole process. Is the Empress Dowager okay with the wait?"</p>
<p>"Not late, not late, forty or fifty days are just a fleeting moment in a person's life," the Empress Dowager replied seemingly patiently. "If you think this dye has special effects, we are willing to try it."</p>
<p>The matter was decided like this. I was truly indescribably happy that the Empress Dowager had allowed me to help her. After leaving, I rushed to find an eunuch to go to my house to tell my father, asking him to immediately send a telegram to Paris, asking a familiar friend to buy some of the best hair dyes for us and send them quickly.

<h3 id="e178">Mrs. Chevalier's Skillful Husband Management <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Haike</p>
<p>French film star Maurice Chevalier, who starred in Hollywood's "The Merry Widow," "Midnight in Paris," and "The Passionate Plumber," gained popularity worldwide, especially among women, for his romantic and humorous style, earning him the title of "World's Greatest Lover."</p>
<p>British magazine reporter Ms. Li specially visited Chevalier's wife, asking her for her opinion on her husband being admired by women. Mrs. Chevalier replied with the following words:</p>
<p>"I am very happy to see my husband so popular. It is to be expected that he would win the love of many women. This is also part of his work.</p>
<p>"How can one find happiness with jealousy in one's heart? Jealousy and happiness cannot go hand in hand. Of course, I understand that women love my husband because I love him that way, too.</p>
<p>"I think if you love your husband, you should bring a maternal aspect to your love. For example, if you are a loving mother, you cannot be selfish. You must see your son happy often.</p>
<p>"In today's world, many people's lives are full of unhappiness. If my husband can bring them some joy, that would be the best thing. I will never forget that others do not have my good fortune.</p>
<p>"Moreover, if husband and wife can trust each other, then they will not want to make the other unhappy. If a woman is often suspicious and jealous, then the man will think, 'What's the use? I might as well do bad things.' Isn't that what I said?</p>
<p>"If a wife can give her husband a happy life, forgetting all worries and troubles, then the husband will naturally be happy to stay with her.</p>
<p>"A man always seeks someone who can comfort him and spend his free time with him. He wants to be comfortable and forget everything. He hopes his wife will be with him, giving him sweet comfort. Aren't these things easy for women to do? So if his wife cannot give them to him, he will naturally go to others.</p>
<p>"Husband and wife cannot both be leaders. I think it's more natural to let the husband take some authority, because he is more suitable for it than women.</p>
<p>"But that doesn't mean women should submit. If she has the skill to manage her husband, can't she be the master?</p>
<p>I think one must work constantly at marriage to achieve perfection, so when I married my husband, I was willing to abandon my career. I felt that if I continued my life as a singer and dancer, I could not create a good home for him. I put all my time into the duties of the home, and I thought it was very important.</p>
<p>"I know my husband respects my duties at home, just as I do for him. Both sides do their duty, and there is no difference between important and unimportant, but the two of us, one is conspicuous in front of the crowd, and the other is conspicuous in the rear. But the rear is as important as the front.</p>
<p>"When I had to abandon my hard-earned career at first, I felt reluctant, because I would no longer be the famous Feng Na Fan Li on the stage, but began to be Mrs. Chevalier. But you can believe now that I am happy to do so, but nothing is more satisfying than being loved by a good man and having a happy family life. Women need these things above all fame and praise.</p>
<p>"When my husband is starring in a film, he works very hard, so I have to find a way to protect him from some harassment, so that he can focus on his work. You must understand that I always want to make him worry-free.</p>
<p>"He is very responsible for his work and is never satisfied with his past achievements. Often when a film is finished, he is already worrying about preparing for the next one.</p>
<p>"So when my husband comes back, I always try to make him forget everything in the studio. We only talk about many interesting things. He talks and laughs, and his heart relaxes. But sometimes he has difficulties in his work and wants to discuss his plans, so I listen quietly. I don't express any opinions, because he knows more than I do after all! I just encourage him and make him happy. This is very important for any man. The next day, he can cheer up and go out to continue his work. All wives should keep this firmly in mind.</p>
<p>"Of course! My husband also has some temper, otherwise, he would not be a great artist. But he doesn't throw tantrums for no reason like other artists. When he gets angry, I walk away and leave him alone. Isn't that the best way?"</p>

<h3 id="e179">Style and Imitation <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Feng</p>
<p>In the literary styles currently popular, we often hear people say that so-and-so has the style of Turgenev, so-and-so is rich in Gorky's style, and so-and-so is close to so-and-so. Such comparisons are truly commonplace and not at all strange.</p>
<p>Such comparisons are incredibly harmful to contemporary writers, overshadowing the supreme crown they wear.</p>
<p>A writer who is willing to bury his head in his writing efforts may initially, intentionally or unintentionally, imitate the styles of others. Over time, his work may inadvertently become tainted by the influence of so-and-so. This is a common occurrence. However, we cannot say that he has succeeded in becoming so-and-so, or even a reincarnation of so-and-so. This is also very clear. Because no matter how much imitation occurs, the author will never be without his own presence in his work. If he has himself, then how much has he learned to resemble? What kind of self is he? Questions arise everywhere. If this self is filled with ignorance and stubbornness, or if what he imitates is ultimately an antique or fossil, then such an author and such a work are fundamentally soulless corpses, rotten objects covered in mold.</p>
<p>Fortunately, even if what he imitates succeeds in achieving a certain percentage of someone else, and that person's model is suitable for the current style, but his own ambition and development are not compatible with it, then what is this someone who has learned to be successful at a certain percentage worth!</p>
<p>Kharatkevich explained this most clearly. In "How I Wrote Cement," he wrote:</p>
<p>"I don't ask myself: how would Tolstoy, Turgenev, Dostoevsky, or Gorky write this, say that. I never even thought about these questions; even if I did, I would banish them, because it is not only unnecessary but also harmful; otherwise, I would be attached to the model and lose my freedom to create."</p>
<p>From this, we can see how a literary giant succeeded in his greatness. Is it self-creation or just imitation?</p>
<p>Let him continue:</p>
<p>"Inheriting art includes the determination to overcome the styles of previous generations, and this is to complete one's own style...</p>
<p>"The difficulty lies not in how to use existing artistic methods (nothing is easier than imitation), but in how to create one's own unique methods, proving to be a new stage of beauty in artistic thought."</p>
<p>This is even clearer, explaining how a writer should be steadfast in his writing and establish his own unique style.</p>
<p>Young writers should also humbly learn from open-minded senior writers in many ways, but not imitate them. It is not a bad thing for a writer to unintentionally accept the influence of someone in his cultivation, but it is unacceptable to resort to imitation. This tendency should not be allowed to develop for long, let alone become deliberately imitative.</p>
<p>Therefore, the aforementioned "commonplace" comparisons create not a new style for great writers, but only arrogance and more deliberate imitation for contemporary writers.</p>

<p>— Ye Zi</p>
<p>The woman let out a sharp cry, rolled over, and her limbs immediately stretched out, stiffening on the ground!</p>
<p>"You dare to ride our foreigners' boat without a ticket, you rotten X!…" he rushed forward, adding curses, as if he were a foreigner himself.</p>
<p>The mother was anxious! She pushed out to grab the pockmarked man, afraid that he would kick her again; at the same time, she protested and questioned:</p>
<p>"Why did you hit her? So fierce!… Didn't you see that she's pregnant?"</p>
<p>"You dare to ride our foreigners' boat without paying?" The pockmarked man retorted with a red face, while eyeing his accountant's face.</p>
<p>"Then, it's just—money…………"</p>
<p>"Hmm! Money!…" another tea boy added heavily.</p>
<p>The mother pondered for a moment, unable to think of a solution, and the woman groaned loudly on the ground! A portion of the onlookers immediately began to discuss in alarm and urgency. But the tea boy with the stick raised the stick high, attempting to continue striking.</p>
<p>The mother rushed to block the tea boy; and approached the woman, looking at her belly with great pity. Suddenly, she stopped groaning, shrinking into a ball with convulsions, her eyes bulging, her teeth tightly biting her lower lip, and screaming in stomach pain! The mother panicked, bent over, squatted down, and stroked her stomach slowly, in waves. Moreover, out of excessive anger, she scolded the brutal tea boy loudly, shouting out the dangerous signs of imminent birth!</p>
<p>The onlookers all retreated. The accountant spat harshly in disgust and hurried away. The tea boys, unable to gain ground, followed like dogs, cursing back with filthy words, and retreated into their cabin.</p>
<p>I also turned to leave, but the mother called me back: instructing me to immediately go to my berth to tear off the yellow blanket; and borrow a pair of scissors and a thin hemp rope.</p>
<p>I went. Hastily passing through the curious, gossiping crowd, when I returned with the items, the mother had already undressed the woman's lower body. A large puddle of filthy water flowed on the ground. Her lips were bitten bloody by her teeth, beads of sweat popped out on her forehead, and her whole body struggled painfully and with difficulty! As soon as she saw me, she turned her face away in shame and shook her hands wildly! But, in an instant, a tiny red baby, dripping with bloody filth, squeezed out! It fell on the ground, crying out its unknowable fate!</p>
<p>I quickly turned away. The mother panted laboriously for about five or six minutes before finally extracting a bloody placenta and throwing it from my left side into the depths of the river.</p>
<p>"It's completely beaten down!" The mother said to me, raising a pair of blood-stained hands in anger: "They are all vicious robbers!… That fetus is simply too small to live. And they are still waiting to ask her for the fare!"</p>
<p>"Then what to do?"</p>
<p>"Saving people requires saving them completely!…" The mother said in a resolute, police-like tone. "Go get me a cup of water, let me wash the child first and then think of a way…"</p>
<p>The sun had already climbed more than ten feet high from the mountains on the left bank of the river. The river wind was gentle, completely losing its nocturnal fury. From the distant tip of the right bank of the river, the outline of the tail of a big city slowly crawled over.</p>

<p>— By S. Ersegev. Jinski, translated by Su Ming</p>
<p>The river grew wider, carrying him along high banks covered in forest, sometimes between many cliffs. He still had to watch ahead, so as not to crash into the large rocks in the water. Shavaka’s semi-savage eyes could see most of the living things in the water and on the shore. In Siberia, summer is not long. In August, the nights were already cold, and he needed a coat. By early September, he could see ice floes in the water, and suddenly one day, snow began to fall instead of rain, and a storm hit him.</p>
<p>Shavaka planned to spend the winter in a village he passed, but while he was still far from any village, the river had already frozen over. Shavaka dragged his boat to a place on the shore, where he saw a cave high on the bank, its entrance half-covered by a large pine tree blown down by a storm. The branches of the pine tree could be climbed up and down like a ladder, and the cave was originally as big as a room. Shavaka brought everything from the boat into the cave, and then happily went to cut some fuel. He used stones to block the entrance of the cave, leaving only a small crack; from the sparse pine branches, he made himself a door; he set up a place to make a fire, and used his axe to open a hole for the smoke to escape. When he first sat down in his cave, and his kettle began to boil in a warm and comfortable room instead of in the open air, he felt completely satisfied with his success, and fell asleep on his pine branch bed.</p>
<p>Waking up, he went to see if his boat was safe. Snow was falling densely, and everything was silent. The whole river was silent, covered with new, solid ice overnight. Shavaka said loudly, "Oh, friend, where have you come to! It doesn't matter, this place is good. There's nothing to shout about." In his long solitude, he had learned to talk to himself. He used words that were so simple and stingy, just as if he were talking to someone else.</p>
<p>When the ice was frozen solid, he used an axe to chisel a hole for the first rope, and then another for the second, and then he set up his net. Thus, in this place that he had never known before, and even now, he still knew nothing about, he began to spend his lonely winter.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Remembering Ming Ruo <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— By Mu Shiying</p>
<p>The night rain pattered on the window glass. Facing the quiet gauze lamp on the desk, I thought of some old things and some old people.</p>
<p>It was two years ago, also on a night with rustling autumn rain, that Ming Ruo and I spent a long, long night in a small city's inn. It was a very old inn. Lying in bed, you could hear the mice running wildly on the ceiling, the hushed whispers of a prostitute and a foreign cloth merchant next door, and the raindrops, just like tonight, steadily beating against the window. The night in a small city is so quiet that there are only the sounds of dogs barking and the watchman's clapper. Listening to the weeping night rain, after lying in bed for a while, I finally sat up again and started smoking, gazing at the dim oil lamp. Ming Ruo didn't seem to be asleep either. Seeing me sit up, he turned over and asked:</p>
<p>"Can't sleep?"</p>
<p>"The rain in the small city is really unbearable, really unbearable."</p>
<p>"Wouldn't it be nice to talk, listening to this tireless rain?"</p>
<p>"But in Shanghai, the rain softens and hazes the neon lights. Ming Ruo, do you remember those Saturday nights we wandered in the streets in the rain?"</p>
<p>He seemed to be thinking about something, sighing and saying, "Look, isn't it fast, so fast? Those days have passed so quickly! You are still a young man sparkling with vitality, but I am already a clod of gray earth. Shanghai, haven't we left Shanghai for a year already?"</p>
<p>His face was blank and looked very depressed. This surprised me. Ming Ruo had always been a bright, humorous, and understanding person; among friends, he had the nickname "Essay." He was a typical small-city resident, who liked to enjoy trivial pleasures in life. After preparing his lessons, he often went to the small restaurant at the school gate to order a few cups of cocoa, eating peanuts and chatting with me about everything under the sun, saying some harmless jokes. He never got angry, nor excited, and as for depression, he didn't seem to have such emotions. That day, unexpectedly, he put on such a depressed face. Maybe it was because of the sad drizzle in this deep night? But after a while, he cheered up again and said:</p>
<p>"If the rain doesn't stop tomorrow, let's play mahjong all day. Imagine, taking off our socks, smoking little cigars, rolling up our sleeves, drawing an inlaid eight-s initially, and then drawing a 'bian san wan' on the second round! He was saying that, and he laughed happily.</p>
<p>"But I have to go back tomorrow no matter what."</p>
<p>"Stay another day. Do you think it's easy to meet up? After leaving school, today is the first day we've met up. Life is like duckweed, who knows when we'll be able to talk half the night like today again."</p>
<p>"If it rains, I'll stay another day."</p>
<p>But the next morning, when we woke up, we saw a very clear sky as if washed by rain. That day, I finally left. When I left, he saw me off at the station and told me to write more letters. Things rarely go as you wish, and even everyday things like writing letters are not entirely under the control of the will. After returning to Shanghai, I only wrote two letters in a year. He also seemed to not have much spare time, and his letters were not frequent either. Because of the infrequent letters, we finally stopped writing to each other.</p>
<p>Last October, he suddenly sent an invitation and a letter, telling me that he was about to get married, and wrote the following very simple and sincere words in the letter:</p>
<p>"A string of Yuanming chrysanthemums has bloomed by our fence. It's been two years since we parted. No matter how busy you are, come and see an old friend, see the clear countryside, see your old friend's lover, and be our groomsman."</p>
<p>I rushed around for several days, preparing to go to his hometown, a small town on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line, Chang'an, to see an old friend and enjoy a few days of leisure. But life is very cruel, and I still couldn't go this time. After that, he didn't send a single letter, and I only got some not very detailed news about him from others.</p>
<p>This spring, I met Brother Jia Bi, and he told me:</p>
<p>"Do you know? Sheng Ming Ruo is gone."</p>
<p>Dead? I didn't quite believe it. We were all very young people, and Ming Ruo had just gotten married and was a fellow with a good soul. Did he die so easily?</p>
<p>Recently, Brother Qian Gongxia came from Ming Ruo's hometown. When I asked him about Ming Ruo, he said:</p>
<p>"Dead, this spring."</p>
<p>Really dead, this good person! Just as he said, fast, so fast, those days passed so quickly. Those days... those days—and now he is already lying underground, and I have already become a clod of gray earth!</p>
<h3 id="e185">Thunderstorm <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— By Ouyang Shan</p>
<p>Our friend Liu Li, who was like a mountain, told us many stories. He himself liked the scenes and characters he described more than anyone else, and his face, made of black English stone, would shine with a compelling light. One of them described a thunderstorm.</p>
<p>"...One autumn evening, I was walking from Hengjiao Village to Mian Village—I knew this road well, so I didn't bring a flashlight. The sky was originally very calm, and I didn't expect it to rain, but it did. It was very heavy. The mud on the road was washed away in less than ten minutes. The coarse sand and small stones bared their long, sharp teeth, biting many holes in my bare feet, causing them to bleed." Liu Li imitated the movements of that time, and began like this.</p>
<p>"I've never encountered such a heavy rain in my life—and such angry thunder! In the darkness, there was nothing but the rain and its sound. But just think: when lightning strikes, you see a world... trembling before your eyes, and the rain actually seems to disappear. When there's thunder, you can't hear the rain.</p>
<p>"I went to an old goose farmer's house to take shelter. His name was Bai Maolao, he was lonely, tall, and had a long white beard. As soon as I pushed open the door and entered his shrine, he loudly stopped me. He didn't pour me tea or bring out dry clothes... He took down two bamboo-woven rain hats from the wall, and lectured me like an elder: 'Is this the age to be avoiding rain? Come with me to the goose shed, I'm going to check on those little things.—Don't go in, you'll startle them. You have things you can look at yourself. Do you like to see the patterns of lightning and the sparks of thunder? Very good, for decades, that's been my hobby! Don't be afraid of it.'</p>
<p>"In front of the goose shed, I did as he told me. I stuck my head out from the night broken by the rain. I straightened my spine as straight as a coconut palm. The spray stung my eyes and nostrils. This time, instead of stealing a glance, I really saw lightning and thunder for the first time!</p>
<p>"I had a rain hat, but it didn't block me at all. I can't describe it anymore, I can only feel it! How a huge, twisting, rapid sword dazzlingly illuminated my eyes and the eyes of all the mountains, rivers, and jungles; how angrily, ruthlessly, and wantonly it tore open the swollen belly of the sky! How the fellow wielding the sword roared and howled! His voice was a heavy iron block, incomparably heavy, accompanied by a crisp, solid burst of sound when it rubbed against sparks, falling onto the mountains, tombs, plains, and rivers, shaking the entire earth, and then exhaling groaning echoes... continuing, not stopping for what felt like an immeasurable amount of time.</p>
<p>"That sword might suddenly stab next to you. Nothing to be afraid of, this is no longer a time to be afraid... You will feel yourself suddenly shrinking, without internal organs, brains, thoughts, memories, you feel like you only have a small piece of wood left, that is yourself. Next to you is an infinitely high wall, composed only of light.</p>
<p>'Nothing to be afraid of, friend, it's a very beautiful sky scene.'"</p>

<h3 id="e186">"Arolsen" and Neurasthenia <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Doctor Feng Shanliang</p>
<p>Neurasthenia, although there is a distinction between cerebral neurasthenia and spinal neurasthenia, and the causes of this disease also vary, some come from mental overwork, and some come from excessive lust, but in treating this disease, directly supplementing with phosphorus is one of the indispensable therapies.</p>
<p>"Arolsen," in Western languages, is an organic phosphorus compound, which contains more phosphorus than other phosphorus preparations. This compound is richly stored in grains and plant roots, such as barley, wheat, corn, peas, lentils, onions, and turnips.</p>
<p>Organic phosphorus compounds are essential elements of various tissues and organs of the human body. All blood, muscles, liver, kidneys, and lungs contain a large amount of this substance, especially nerves and bone marrow.</p>
<p>The need for phosphorus in the human body is known to be so great. Usually, those with weak gastrointestinal digestion, reduced assimilation, and excessive consumption of phosphorus must directly supplement with phosphorus.</p>
<p>The use of phosphorus in the treatment field has been around for a long time, but being able to use it as an effective nourishing product for neurasthenia and poor development can be said to be a new advancement in modern academia. What is needed is organic phosphorus, so to seek an effective phosphorus preparation, one should take the acquisition of organic matter as the standard. (Editor's note: "Arolsen" is a compound of organic phosphorus and calcium, etc. It can be used for all diseases that require phosphorus supplementation, and it can also be used as a nutritional product, such as after illness weakness, mental and physical fatigue, malnutrition, chlorosis, anemia, osteomalacia, nervous system functional diseases, neurasthenia, hysteria, mental illness, etc. can all take this product.

<h3 id="e187">Qualitative Detoxification Method for Quitting Smoking <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Doctor She Lei</p>
<p>Those with opium addiction must have anti-opium toxins and neutralizing opium toxins in their bodies. In other words, the cells in their bodies are combined with opium toxins, so they can tolerate the amount of smoking that ordinary people cannot tolerate. Therefore, it is necessary to gradually consume it with an appropriate amount of smoking every day.</p>
<p>What is the method of quitting smoking? It is to remove the opium toxins that are combined with the cells. Although in the process of quitting, all the old diseases of the person being detoxified - the old diseases obscured by opium - must be completely cured in order to quit properly. But the method of eradicating this smoking addiction is, after all, an indispensable means for quitting smoking.</p>
<p>Organic calcium in the medicine can separate the smoking toxins combined with the cells. Is it possible to quit smoking with it? Although it is not as fast as one's own blood serum, it is indeed much better than the best egg yolk and the oldest diminishing method, etc. If organic calcium combined with glucose is selected, it will be even more perfect. In addition to eliminating smoking toxins, it can also nourish the cells that have just been detoxified, so that they gradually return to normal. The number of injections of this agent depends on the amount of smoking and the length of addiction. To quit smoking with this method, the first thing to pay attention to is to be sure to find out whether the person quitting has any old diseases, and then properly remove the diseases obscured by opium, so as to achieve a satisfactory result. Otherwise, it will be undoubtedly a waste of effort. In addition, when implementing this method, it is also necessary to inject egg yolk at the same time. Injecting egg yolk can prevent the appearance of symptoms such as insomnia, impotence, and spermatorrhea. As for egg yolk, the Western name is lecithin, which is an organic phosphorus compound, a necessary medicine for nourishing the brain and nerves. It is used to treat neurasthenia. Applying this substance when quitting smoking is because the nerve tissue of smokers has vigorous decomposition and the phosphoric acid in the excrement increases, so it is indeed necessary to input this product. However, it may be difficult to obtain a more satisfactory result by simply holding this product and wanting to completely eliminate smoking addiction.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Chronic Persistent Gastric Juice Leakage <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Doctor She Lei</p>
<p>The inherent symptom of this disease is that gastric juice is secreted not only during digestion, but also when the stomach is empty. It is also called hypersecretion. But there is a small amount of liquid in the stomach when it is empty. If there is 20cc or even 30cc or more of gastric juice when the stomach is empty, and there are stomach symptoms at the same time, then it is undoubtedly this disease.</p>
<p>Although the cause of this disease is mostly due to mental excitement and stomach irritation, the main cause has to be attributed to nervous temperament. This disease may occur independently, or it may occur together with gastric ulcer and pyloric stenosis with incomplete motor function.</p>
<p>The subjective symptoms of those suffering from this disease are similar to those of hyperacidity. There are various digestive disorders. The stomach feels pain a few hours before or after meals. A large amount of gastric juice is vomited. The appetite is usually relatively strong. The stool is mostly constipated. The objective symptoms. When the stomach is empty, auscultation of the stomach has a superficial splashing sound. Examination of the vomit shows that it is thin and watery. Also, because the vomited matter contains pure gastric juice, followed by motor disorders, the gastric juice always contains food residue.</p>
<p>To accurately diagnose this disease, it must be repeatedly tested on an empty stomach in the morning.</p>
<p>This disease is a chronic symptom and is prone to recurrence, so it is not easy to cure.</p>
<p>When treating this disease, the dietary therapy has device therapy, which are generally the same as hyperacidity. For drug therapy, argentogelatose silver nitrate is commonly used for oral administration. It is said that gastric lavage is the best treatment for this disease, and it is said that it is advisable in the morning.</p>
<p>(Editor's note: Argentogelatose is an indispensable drug therapy for this disease. Among this type of medicine, the Gastron is particularly excellent, which is sold by Renshou Western Medicine Company, No. 1, Laodehang Lane, Mintini Yin Road, Baxianqiao, French Concession, Shanghai. A mild case can be cured by taking one box. It is said that each box only sells for two yuan. Add one yuan for postage.)</p>
<h3 id="e189">Mesaltropin is the Leader in Oral Medications for Gonorrhea <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Doctor Cui Fuqing</p>
<p>Gonorrhea. The first infection is mostly acute anterior urethral gonorrhea. There are few cases of invasion of the posterior urethra. However, if it is arbitrarily left untreated or the treatment is not thorough, the gonococcus will lie dormant and multiply. The scope of its expansion and the part it invades are difficult to predict. What is commonly seen in clinical practice is gonococcal arthritis, orchitis, etc.</p>
<p>However, knowing that it is a local disease of the urethra, local treatment is sufficient. Why is it necessary to use various other methods? This is because local treatment is difficult to achieve complete success. Examining the medicines for local treatment of gonorrhea, the most recommended and appropriate one is proteinized silver, such as Protargol and Choleval, etc. Although these are superior products, as long as the doctor can use them properly, it is possible to achieve the effect of not damaging the urethral mucosa and killing gonococcus. However, the gonococcus lying dormant in the deep layers cannot be achieved by this medicine. Therefore, the medical community has recently made new discoveries and new creations in external medicines for gonorrhea. "Gonorrhea Soother" produced by the German Manerzhi Pharmaceutical Factory is a colloid made from gonorrhea serum, which is injected into the urethra when used. After my clinical trials, it is indeed much more effective than the above-mentioned medicines. After using it two or three times for acute gonorrhea, there is no longer any pain. However, when using the Chu medicine, attention must be paid to covering the inflamed surface of the entire urethral mucosa, that is, the area occupied by gonococcus. Otherwise, leaving one or two will be difficult to cure. In addition, when using this product, it is also necessary to take into account the elimination of inflammation and swelling, the prevention of penile erection and spermatorrhea, and the disinfection of the genital and urinary organs. Therefore, it is necessary to also use oral medications. According to personal clinical experience, the oral medication for gonorrhea must meet the following conditions to be a holy product. (1) It must be non-irritating, so it will not cause gastrointestinal disorders and cause kidney inflammation, proteinuria, etc. (2) The bactericidal power is strong, so it can achieve the effect of urinary tract disinfection. (3) There are no astringent drug ingredients, so there will be no false recovery of gonorrhea. (4) The drug can penetrate the mucosa deeply, so the gonococcus lying dormant deep in the mucosa can be killed. (5) Eliminating inflammation and swelling can calm the sexual nerves, so it can prevent erection and spermatorrhea. The holy medicine for gonorrhea that has these five major characteristics, which I have used without a doubt, is "Mesaltropin" produced by the American Lingyang Company. Mesaltropin is truly the leader in oral medications for gonorrhea. (Editor's note: The two medicines for gonorrhea external use, "Gonorrhea Soother" and gonorrhea oral medication "Mesaltropin" are both sold by Renshou Western Medicine Company, No. 1, Laodehang Lane, Mintini Yin Road, Baxianqiao, French Concession, Shanghai. The former is two yuan and five jiao per can, and the latter is one yuan per box. Add one postage fee for postal delivery.)</p>
<h3 id="e190">Female Gonorrhea <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Doctor Liu Xuannv</p>
<p>Female gonorrhea is completely the same as male gonorrhea. It is caused by infection with gonococcus. Others are caused by infection with bacilli, staphylococcus, streptococcus, or a mixture of various bacteria. After infection with this disease, it goes through a certain incubation period, the mucus phase, the inflammation phase, and then the purulent discharge phase, discharging a large amount of pus. When the lesion is only limited to the urethra, there are no subjective symptoms, only a slight feeling of moisture near the urethral opening, slightly different from usual. However, the female urethra is short and wide, so after infection with this disease, it is easy to develop bladder inflammation. Cystitis often develops after urethritis. After cystitis develops, the patient's subjective changes are significant, such as frequent urination. Sometimes, because the body cannot be kept still, it can immediately spread to the entire surface of the bladder. At this time, the most obvious symptom is painful urination several times an hour, with hematuria. However, mild cases only feel itchy and may have subsequent inguinal lymphadenitis. These acute symptoms are often alleviated with ordinary treatment. However, if the bacteria penetrate deeply and become chronic, it is more difficult to treat than in men. Most women are ashamed to seek medical treatment because of this hidden disease. They do not know that the harm is endless and they will regret it later. The best way to treat the disease is to seek medical treatment while strictly adhering to health preservation. However, sometimes due to time and space constraints, or the burden of family and economy, one can only seek self-treatment. Among the self-treatment methods, the best is to use both oral and external methods. "Mesaltropin" and "Gonorrhea Soother" sold by Renshou Western Medicine Company, No. 1, Laodehang Lane, Mintini Yin Road, Baxianqiao, French Concession, Shanghai. The former is the holy medicine for oral treatment of the disease, one yuan per box. The latter is the holy medicine for external use for this disease, two yuan and five jiao per can. For those with the disease in the urethra, inject it into the urethra. For those with the disease in the vagina, inject it into the vagina. There are instruments available for convenient use. It is said that the medicine company has a postal delivery department. Add one postage fee for postal purchase from other places.</p>

<h3 id="e192">From "Children's Year" to "Children's" Theater <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— A Traveler in Gangnam</p>
<p>This year is a year of many disasters. War, floods, droughts... compounded by frequent foreign troubles. It is truly more tragic than any other year. It seems not too much to call it an unprecedented year of disaster. However, unexpectedly, from August 1st of this year, it was designated as "Children's Year." In such a year of many disasters, to be able to pay special attention to the lives of children, it seems like something to celebrate for our large group of children.</p>
<p>Now that "Children's Year" has begun, people are busy celebrating "Children's Year" and are committed to "working hard" for children's culture and various undertakings. Among them, the most "hardworking" are a group of merchants. They make sanitary candies for children, create new-style clothing and toys for children, and publish a large number of children's books. Even film merchants who have never paid attention to children are preparing to produce a large number of children's films from this year onwards. This grand and mighty array is indeed enough to make children happy. It's just a pity that these blessings can only be enjoyed by some wealthy children. The homeless street children still only quench their thirst with plums, unable to share any of it. Therefore, I think that if we really want to designate a "Children's Year," then we must designate a "Street Children's Year" for street children, because after all, the status of the two types of children is too different to be mixed together. The kind of street children in Pantaleev's "Watch" who can get such a good education opportunity cannot be found in China at all.</p>
<p>But I have to say again, China's special environment is somewhat different from other countries. Although we cannot say, like fatalists, that we have to wait for many years before we can immediately achieve this stage, it is indeed true. What's more, our country is still trapped in a year of many disasters in the midst of deep water and scorching fire?</p>
<p>After reading Pantaleev's "Watch," quite a few people expressed some opinions such as sentiments. Some people are even afraid that we will imitate blindly, so when they hear someone clamoring to adapt this fairy tale into a movie, they can't help but have some objections, and as a result, no one continues to adapt it. In fact, there is no need to worry about this. I think that if the screenwriter has a bit of vision, he will definitely clearly see the current situation in China, and adapt (adapt!) based on the "Chinese situation," at least it is no longer completely the same! Moreover, I think the significance of adapting "Watch" is more practical than someone adapting "Education of Love," because what is said here is not fantasy, but fact.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think of the street children who love drama in general. Their dramas are very simple and relevant to their lives. They love puppet shows, shadow plays, big plays... Sometimes, they simply use their own torn clothes, short bamboo poles, etc., a few people get together, and start acting. Perhaps they didn't think about whether this was for fun or for what, but they are the same as ordinary children in their love of drama. It's just that they don't have the money to go to the theater to watch plays, to go to school to act in plays, but only watch street plays on the street, and play the nondescript "children's plays."</p>
<p>Everyone seems to agree that drama and film contain educational significance. Then, I think, now that the production of children's films is being enthusiastically promoted, children's theater seems to be a matter that cannot be ignored, right? Moreover, I think that using street theater to educate street children in general is more interesting than forcing them to join literacy classes. Even for ordinary, more "fortunate" children, training them to become a group of children's theater actors, and providing them with some simple and meaningful plays to watch, is as necessary as giving them movies to watch.</p>

<p>— Yago</p>
<p>After passing the Seven-Foot Ridge and going down the slope, I suddenly heard someone shouting behind me: "Hey! Friend, wait a moment." I stopped and looked back, only to find that it was an old man selling raspberry, carrying a heavy load and braving the scorching sun of July, panting as he rushed down from the ridge. I waited silently for him to arrive, and then started walking again.</p>
<p>He pulled a towel from his shoulder, wiped the sweat off his face, followed closely behind me, and muttered worriedly:</p>
<p>"This kind of weather... Someone will get heatstroke... Haven't seen it in thirty years."</p>
<p>I ignored him, rushing on my way, calculating the distance I had traveled in my mind.</p>
<p>After the Lesser and Greater Heat seasons, the weather has been extremely hot, and the sun is like a fiery wheel patrolling in the sky.</p>
<p>The old man selling raspberries ran as if he were crawling. After a while, when I turned my head to look, he had unconsciously fallen far behind. He anxiously and suffocatingly shouted loudly in a pitiful tone:</p>
<p>"Hey! Good friend, for the sake of an old man, wait for me one more time!" I had to stop the load again, hid under a willow tree by the roadside and waited for him. He limped with his short legs and crawled over, also put down the load. This time he was afraid that I would rush on my way immediately, making him unable to keep up and being left scattered on the remote mountain ridge, so he said:</p>
<p>"In such sultry weather, you have to stop and rest for a while, don't be in such a hurry, anyway, you can't make it to the early market."</p>
<p>I thought his words made sense, so I agreed to rest, but I said:</p>
<p>"The willow shade here is not good for resting, let's go to the pine forest ahead!"</p>
<p>He hesitated at first, but later agreed. We picked up the loads and walked slowly. He was very excited, no longer as sullen as before, and loudly ridiculed the unreasonable hot weather, the low price of raspberries, the difficult life of the poor, and so on. I occasionally interjected one or two sentences from his words, agreeing or explaining his words. He was extremely excited and exclaimed loudly behind me:</p>
<p>"The young people of this generation, I say, all have problems. There are few who are as sensible and reasonable as you."</p>
<p>We talked and walked, and unknowingly arrived at the pine forest at the foot of the hill. We chose a place where we could sit down and rest, put down the loads, took off the bamboo hats from our heads and fanned ourselves. The old man chose a pine root to sit on, and asked me to sit opposite him, took out a pipe from his waist, filled it with tobacco, and smoked leisurely. After a pipe, his spirit became more lively and excited, and he said loudly for no reason:</p>
<p>"Good friend, do you know the story of this pine forest?" I shook my head, and he laughed. "It's like this. Three years ago, in a June when raspberries were on the market, I sold a load of red raspberries from Sicheng and hired a porter to carry them through here. It was a sultry day, and the sun was burning like fire. After rushing down the ridge, we were both too hot to walk, so we rested in this pine forest. You think, we hadn't rested for even the time it takes to eat a meal when a miserable whimper came from the pine forest. We didn't know why, but the more we listened, the more frightened we became. The porter was so scared that his face turned pale and his mouth turned white, and he trembled and shouted, 'It's bitter!' and fainted. I was so scared that I didn't know what to do, so I ran away, running towards a place where there were people.</p>
<p>"I ran desperately, and I don't know how long I ran before I stopped in a village. Thinking of that load of raspberries, I shouted for help. The villagers quickly ran out and surrounded me. I told them everything. Everyone was very surprised at the time, and about a hundred people were gathered, carrying knives and guns, and went straight to the pine forest. My red raspberries and the porter were gone together. I couldn't help but cry out in pain. Everyone comforted me and said, 'It must be inside!' So we went into the forest, and after running through countless twists and turns, someone found bloodstains on the ground. Running further in, there was a whole small leg of a woman, hanging bloodily on the tree. At the same time, someone heard a faint cry. This scare made everyone unable to take care of everything and ran around.</p>
<p>"Since then, it has been rumored that there are living demons appearing here. People are afraid and dare not pass through here again. The reason I asked you to wait just now was because I was afraid of being alone. Now that we have two companions, what are we afraid of!"</p>
<p>After the old man finished telling his story, he had enough of his tobacco addiction, and said excitedly, "Let's go!" Everyone started walking again.</p>

<p>— Xiao Qi</p>
<p>Uncle Sanxi, who went out naked twenty years ago, returned naked a month or two ago after twenty years. It's like a dream. Half a lifetime has passed in the blink of an eye. Uncle Sanxi is now approaching fifty years old, but he doesn't have the decadent look of an old man. His eyes are still very sharp, and he can still walk long distances in the hot sun. His body is so fat... What can it be compared to except a plump sow. Now it is the end of midsummer, and fat people are very afraid of heat. Uncle Sanxi is especially afraid. His whole body is layered with folds of flesh. Every day as soon as the sun shows its face, he runs out to blow the wind under a pile of big banyan trees outside the house, wildly waving a fan, but sweat still hangs down in large clusters like a sudden rain. So Uncle Sanxi only wears a pair of shorts from morning to night, his upper body completely naked, his big belly protruding, but he still shouts and yells, unbearably hot. So he must take three or five well water baths a day...</p>
<p>Uncle Sanxi has been away from his hometown for a full twenty years, and as a result, he has become a pauper, which is enough to make his family deeply disappointed. In addition, he has brought back an even more abhorrent bad habit - drinking. He must have a glass of wine with two of his three meals a day, otherwise he simply can't eat. But his alcohol tolerance is not high, and his temper is bad. After drinking two or three glasses of wine, his face immediately turns red, and he staggers, one step at a time, from the store to home, and from home to the store, or he just sits on the doorstep of his house, opens his sandy and sluggish throat, and rambles in front of everyone:</p>
<p>—Achang doesn't look at me, does he still recognize me as his father?</p>
<p>In a drunken daze, he always particularly complained about his son Achang, and even cursed at him. He is old, and he is somewhat taking advantage of his drunken outburst. No one argues with him, no one answers him, letting him babble endlessly. Everyone advises him to go back to the house and have a good sleep, and not to get angry and catch a cold. Sometimes he hasn't finished his own words when he can't support himself and falls to the ground from the threshold with a "thud," and waits for his son to help him back to the house. Others don't have the strength to care about his heavy body, they just stand and watch. Every time it often ends with such a funny scene.</p>
<p>Uncle Sanxi often quarrels with his son Achang. Father and son can't get along. His family of six or seven people all rely on Achang's small fruit shop in the nearby street to support them, but the market is bad, and the money earned is limited. The days are almost dragging on day by day. After Erxi returned, he helped look after his son's shop, but he didn't understand how to work at all, he only knew how to drink and spend his days idly. As for the burden of the family, because Achang was shouldering it, he didn't think about it at all, and he was free and comfortable. At first, his son sent him to the fruit market in the morning with money to buy some fresh goods. But once he went, a journey that could be returned in an hour, he often didn't return slowly until noon, with red eyes and speaking incoherently, the strong smell of alcohol rushing out of his mouth in waves. Naturally, it was clear at a glance that he had deducted the money for buying goods to drink alcohol, and the same situation happened several times. Achang couldn't help but get angry, but he just looked at you without any expression. After that, Achang didn't dare to trust his father anymore, so he had to run errands himself, and then asked Sanxi to guard the shop. But as soon as Achang went out, Sanxi had his way again. He secretly reached into the big bamboo tube with copper coins and grabbed a handful, hiding it in his pocket. Later, he let an ignorant grandson guard the shop, and he quietly slipped out. Soon Achang came back, and as soon as he saw the scene, he immediately understood clearly in his heart. However, he could only frown. As an old man, he still doesn't know whether he's dead or alive, there's no way, so he sighed.</p>
<p>After this, Achang had to manage the money in the shop strictly himself. When he was not in the shop, he asked his wife to manage it, so that it was impossible for Sanxi to get a single copper. Therefore, Sanxi occasionally drank alcohol and took the opportunity to scold his son.</p>

<p>— (By Mr. Hu Zhimei)</p>
<p>Floods reaching the sky have been heard since ancient times. King Yu controlled the floods for nine years and succeeded. This year is. Along the Yangtze River and the Yellow River. The raging waves break the banks and harm the people. The vast overflow is difficult to contain. I don't know how many thousands of people have drowned. Houses collapse. Fields and crops are submerged. Everyone's property is gone. People and animals drift with the waves. A vast expanse of water is level with the roofs. The most tragic. Half asleep in the middle of the night, dreams are not stable. In an instant, wind and waves bring great disaster. The wind is like hitting. The waves are like rushing. Raindrops are like soldiers on standby after sleeping. Oh. Pity. But hear. Calling children. Calling mother. Sad sounds mixed in the roaring tide. Even if you shout until your throat is hoarse. It is really difficult to pull you out of the city of wrongful death. A family's flesh and blood are all scattered. Where to find the living and the dead? Hungry in the stomach and left in the water. Even if you don't die, it's hard to escape. Such a disaster situation is so tragic. How many times have people heard of it? Think of you, living in a heavenly fairy Buddha land. Abundant food and clothing are too much, and you are also powerless. You must know. Disaster areas are not like dance floors. Embracing each other in the dusk. Drifting with the waves, the body has no master. Sad voice. Don't see that. Traffic lights. You must know. Disaster areas are not like movie theaters. Immersed in water, cold as ice. No need. To eat ice cream again. You must know. Disaster areas are not like parks. Murmuring and talking about love. Only hear. Crying and shouting for a savior. You must know. Disaster areas cannot be used as sea bathing. Neither has. Rubber ring. Also doesn't have. Lifeboat. Only that. A board. A bench. Seeking survival in the stormy waves. Comparing the bitterness and happiness in this way. Heaven and hell are clearly divided. I am. Singing to the point of sadness, my heart is tired. Tears are like broken strings of pearls. Also like. Ten thousand steel knives piercing the chest. Therefore, I still hope that you will be generous. Vigorously donate to help the disaster victims. Fortune and longevity, and many children and grandchildren.</p>

<p>Prime Minister's clever plan is highly praised. The Mouse King nodded after hearing it. He believes that his family has great fortune. Your plan is the best. Sure enough, I know the secret. It really is. The people of the Mouse Kingdom invite happiness. Hurry up and send someone from the village. Too much dreaming and sleeping will ruin things. The Prime Minister listens. Happy and carefree. After all, our king is afraid of only cats. The crazy cat is inherently fierce and stubborn. He rushes forward without looking back. Unlike the weak mouse. Clever plans are indeed clever. Today I will use the quick loop to deceive the maiden and princess to be the son-in-law of the mouse as a hostage. From now on, I am not afraid of evil cats teasing me. So he sent the governor. Huangtang ordered to go to the Cat Dynasty. Hurriedly leave the homeland. Wading through water and climbing mountains, crossing wild bridges. Not just one day or one night. Good day to visit Danxiao. Happily encountered the Cat King sighing. Because of the princess's beautiful face. Hearing that the nose king's envoy has arrived. I can't help but get angry. Said that the other country is small. It's boring under my crotch. Dare to see me today. Immediately tie him up and execute him. The mouse country's Huangtang trembled. Madly shouting for the minister to report the root cause. The virtuous and filial master of Qinggong in our country has long been popular in Youliao. The big country and small country are all admired. She lives deeply in Zhaoyang and lacks a jade jiao. Therefore, the minister dares to offend. Please allow the golden mouth to allow the fragrant sedan. The Cat King listened to the report and pondered in his heart. Lowered his head and pondered, stretching his lazy waist. This strange marriage is destined. The son of the Mouse King is really wearing a skirt. I have long heard that he is a virtuous and benevolent master. He is a jade tree with my child. They are a good match. They will definitely be as close as lacquer in the future. It's okay to allow it today. Immediately agree to the marriage. Although it is a foreign romance. It is a marriage destined from a thousand miles away. The next section of the wedding will be revealed later.</p>

<p>— Luo Gen</p>
<p>Happy Forest has completed the films "Three Daughters-in-Law" with dubbing and the sound film "Little Aunt." The films to be produced are "Recreating Heaven," written by Hu Zhaoguang, and "Red Ling Yan," written by Gao Yawen. We are still trying to find a suitable drama.</p>
<p>"Little Aunt" director Qian is a decisive and resolute new figure. "Little Aunt" gave him an opportunity to try a sound film. He grasped it tightly. From the start of filming to submission for review, he was seen working diligently all day long. Therefore, the excellent results of "Little Aunt" are inevitable.</p>
<p>"Three Daughters-in-Law," directed by Wang Tianbei and starring Xu Suzhen, Chen Yan, and Bai Ye, has been promoted for a long time. Although it has already been publicly screened in other places, it has been postponed to the present due to the seriousness of various aspects in this city. It is now heard that it will be simultaneously screened in two major theaters in Shanghai in the near future.</p>
<p>Comedian Zhao Tushan participated in the sound film "Parents and Children" of the Culture Film Company. Now he is acting in "Triumphant Song" for Yihua Film Company. He is truly capable and works hard.</p>
<p>It is heard that Bai Ye, one of the main actors of "Three Daughters-in-Law," will be a new bride. Bai Ye played the most virtuous model daughter-in-law in "Three Daughters-in-Law." I think Miss Bai is now performing the drama in reality.</p>
<p>In "Little Aunt," Xia Peizhen's romantic vanity, Ying Yin's passionate virtue, Luo Jun's纨绔子弟, Zhou Fengwen's charity, and Yao Ping's cunning are all considered by Min to be the most successful performances.</p>

<p>Disaster All Starts with Family Division</p>
<p>A perfectly good rural family, owning a lot of land, with five brothers (eldest Wang Xianzhai, second eldest Xi Jianong, third Sun Min, fourth Gao Zhanfei, fifth Zhao Dan). They should have cooperated, inherited the family business, saved this bankrupt rural village, and lived a happy and peaceful life.</p>
<p>However, they ended up, because of suspicion between brothers and jealousy between sisters-in-law, dividing the good family into a mess. Family division is not absolutely a bad thing. It can promote independence and upward courage among individuals, but the eldest Wang Xianzhai and Yi Jue Lin both admired the city life. After the division, they moved to Shanghai, speculated unsuccessfully, and were deceived. Not only did they themselves taste the bitterness of family ruin, but they also implicated the second and third brothers, who also perished in the wave of urban sins.</p>
<p>"Nora" in the "Goddess of Freedom"</p>
<p>When Wang Xianzhai, Xi Jianong, and Sun Min were critically ill in the hospital one after another, Gao Zhanfei and Zhao Dan rushed to visit them. Wang Xianzhai, in broken sentences, spoke of his current awakening and regretted his past mistakes. The desolate and tragic emotion filled the surroundings of the sickbed, but regret was already too late. In an instant, they successively embarked on the road to death.</p>
<p>Finally, Gao Zhanfei shouted the slogan of returning to the countryside, and Zhao Dan also wanted to give up his studies and work with his brother in rural work.</p>
<p>Return to the countryside! This is the high-pitched cry in the "Big Family" because, although the countryside has already gone bankrupt, it is not a good business to squeeze into the economically collapsing metropolis.</p>

<h3 id="e205">Architecture in Amsterdam, Netherlands (Part 1) <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Yue Qi</p>
<p>Amsterdam in the Netherlands is one of the cities famous for its architectural art, and it is also a city with clear contrasting colors. It has monuments rich in historical interest; it also has equally interesting completely modern buildings related to modern business. In the crisscrossing canals, yachts painted in old-fashioned colors sail leisurely, while on the banks, noisy cars rush by. People walking on the streets mostly wear modern clothes, but everywhere you can still encounter pedestrians dressed like their ancestors.</p>
<p>Like many important cities in Northern Europe, Amsterdam's main activities are forever related to the shipbuilding industry and shipping business. Managing waterways is one of Amsterdam's biggest problems. The construction of dams and the cutting off of canals have made Amsterdam almost a group of small islands. These canals, no more than three and a half feet deep, are kept fresh by the irrigation waters of the North Sea River.</p>
<p>On both sides of the Grachts, which are connected to each other by small canals, are the houses of old merchants and important citizens. These noble houses are mostly Dutch style, completely different in nature from those in other parts of Europe. Their ages vary, but their structures are generally the same. Houses from the early seventeenth century stand next to houses from the eighteenth century and later. Both types of buildings are based on driving wooden piles into the mud, the difference being that early houses used more wood, while later houses used more cement.</p>
<p>The structure of the old merchants' houses on both sides of the Grachts is mostly wood-based. After the wooden piles are driven in, a wooden platform is built on top of the wooden piles, and a wooden framework is erected on top of the platform. After the framework is built, the walls are laid. The walls are painted with oil or tar to protect against moisture. Therefore, the old-fashioned houses in Amsterdam are mostly dark in color, but fortunately, the cheese-colored paint used on the wood and windows and the green paint used on the doors and windows mask the dark color a lot.</p>
<p>The interiors of these old-fashioned houses are quite interesting, and the layouts are almost the same. The basement is used as a kitchen and storage room. The door leading to the basement is located under the stairs leading to the main house. The lower floor of the main house is used as an office, and the upper floor is used as a residence. The floors and walls of the temple rooms are paved with dolomite; dolomite has a huge market in Amsterdam. Currently, these old-fashioned houses are almost entirely used for commercial purposes, and the houses from the early seventeenth century are used as warehouses, but the structure of these buildings still influences the design of modern architecture.</p>
<p>The restrictions and narrowness of the building site make interior design very difficult. One of the results is that the steps are steep, making it almost impossible to move heavy goods and furniture. Therefore, these houses are equipped with cranes to hoist goods. Cranes, which have become one of the characteristics of Amsterdam's architecture, are still used even in newly built residential areas; at the same time, in the recently built houses, these cranes have become indispensable, and the steep steps also exist as in the old-fashioned houses.</p>
<p>In the new areas as well as in the old areas, brick is the common material used for building houses. This is very natural in the Netherlands, because there are many good brickyards all over the Netherlands. The soil in these places creates bricks of various colors. Dutch bricks are completely different in size from bricks produced in other parts of Europe; the famous four-and-a-half-inch brick in England cannot be found in the Netherlands. Dutch bricks are rarely more than two and a quarter inches thick, and some are only one and a half inches thick. These small units give Dutch buildings a special character, especially when arranged in variegated colors. The same bricks are also used to build roads. The impression given is of completely brick-built streets, with houses and roads using the same materials.</p>
<p>The new construction in Amsterdam is very different in style from the old buildings, but they blend with the old buildings in a satisfactory way. All new buildings have a Dutch flavor that is entirely due to conscious or unconscious traditional forces. It is the spirit of this traditional force that maintains the special Dutch air that permeates Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Like most European cities, Amsterdam also suffered the fate of the advent of industrialism in the nineteenth century, at which time the situation in architecture was undifferentiated and unmanaged. The development of architecture did not follow rules; the construction of streets was not specially planned; several old and crowded areas in the east had almost become slums. Currently, the municipal authorities have planned to clear these eastern areas, and some residents have been relocated to new residential areas. Amsterdam's housing renovation plan began after World War I, when the motivation was a lack of housing. The municipal authorities adopted a policy of buying land at random opportunities to prevent land prices from soaring. Amsterdam's municipal renovation plan is very ambitious, but the steps to implement the plan are very steady. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e206">Restrictions on Building Height <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Pusheng</p>
<p>The construction of housing is closely related to human health, and whether or not there is sufficient sunlight is the most important factor. Housing needs sufficient sunlight and even direct sunlight. Mr. Charles B. Ball, the health director of Chicago, once said: If indoor light and air are not good, then physiologically, there will be a loss of appetite, weight loss, poor eyesight, and neurasthenia.</p>
<p>However, in modern times, with the development of commercial capital and the progress of building materials, such as the use of reinforced concrete, many towering buildings have been produced. The shadows of these buildings reduce the direct and indirect sunlight of nearby lower houses, thereby damaging the health of the residents. And for the buildings themselves, there are also disadvantages, such as the darkness in the lower-level rooms, which requires lighting even during the day; if there is a fire, then the danger for those living on the upper floors is even greater. Therefore, the cities of various countries have laws restricting the height of houses; the method is generally determined by the width of the road in front of the building. For example, the regulations in England and Japan are:</p>
<p>Japan Residential area—The height of the house shall not exceed one and a quarter times the width of the street in front.</p>
<p>Other—The height of the house shall not exceed one and a half times the width of the street in front.</p>
<p>England Residential area—One time</p>
<p>Other—One and a half times</p>
<p>If it is necessary to increase the height during construction, the building line must be appropriately set back, so that the street is widened, and in proportion, it still conforms to the principle of restriction, and the lower layers of the building and the adjacent houses can still receive the sunlight from the top of the opposite roof. However, the ratio of setback to height increase is also not uniform; if the setback is one foot, the number of feet to increase is at least half a foot and at most three or four feet, among which the ratio of one to one is the most common. However, some laws also limit this method; for example, in Japan, the maximum height of houses in residential areas must not exceed 65 feet, and in other areas, the limit is 100 feet.</p>
<p>Shanghai also has the same regulations on this matter:</p>
<p>The height of buildings along the highway shall not exceed one and a half times the width of the road. (That is, the ratio of the width of the road to the height of the building is 1 to 1.5) When the height exceeds the above regulations, the upper-level buildings should be retracted layer by layer in a ratio of 1 to 1.5. For buildings at corners, if the facades on both sides are equal along the road, the height can be based on the wider highway. The height of old-fashioned houses loaded with wooden pillars shall not exceed 11 meters (or 36 feet) and shall not be built on four floors. For houses with brick walls on all four corners, if the internal building materials are not sufficient for fire prevention, the height shall not exceed 18 meters (or 60 feet). The height of buildings constructed of steel, reinforced concrete, or specified fire-resistant materials shall not exceed 25 meters (or 82 feet). The height of the building is based on the road surface to the eaves. If there are additional buildings on the roof that exceed two-tenths of the total area of the building, then the height of the building should be based on these additional buildings.</p>
<p>Building towering buildings has no benefit other than saving land area; and the expenses incurred are doubled. The reason for this is nothing more than showing off to the public in order to achieve the effect of commercial advertising; therefore, these buildings are mostly department stores, not residential buildings. Since it is harmful to the health of the people, it should be restricted by law.</p>

<p>However, although this method of construction seems almost permanently suitable for the British background, we now seem to have reached its end. This is because our way of life has changed so drastically and so rapidly in recent times. We modern people, due to the novelty of habits and the abundance of inventions, are not suitable for living in old-fashioned houses or entrusting ourselves to old-fashioned backgrounds. Moreover, the application of steel beams and reinforced concrete, as well as the methods of all new objects, require new designs and constructions, and then we can harvest satisfactory benefits.</p>
<p>At present, although there are still a few people who are still quite concerned about the magnificence of houses, most of us require lightness, ventilation, convenience, reasonable price, neatness, and smoothness for our residences. We do not need any decoration or pretense, we all need complete equipment provided by scientific capabilities that provide comfort, benefit, and labor-saving. Now, only a very small number of wealthy people love and have the ability to set up old-fashioned luxury buildings, and what most people need is pure architecture that has the three conditions of "sturdy," "practical," and "comfortable."</p>
<p>This of course refers to small and dense residences suitable for most people to live in. The apartment-style "high-rise" popular in Germany, Scandinavia, and the Soviet Union, and the skyscrapers of New York, are the products of this new trend. After having a small house that is enough to settle a family, we need more beautiful and spacious public houses to provide for public entertainment, education, and social purposes.</p>
<p>Because there are too many people who are dissatisfied with the old way of life, they will definitely start to experiment with new ways of life; at a certain period, the emergence of a certain type of building that suits the new way of life is undoubtedly. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e208">Various Valuations <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Jiyao</p>
<p>The purpose of valuation is accuracy. Everyone can create the most accurate and convenient method and apply it. However, to know how to estimate accurately, you must first know how the common magic in the world is now, so that you can refer to it and improve it. Now I will describe the grain seed valuation method as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Cubic Foot Values. This estimation is widely used in European and American countries, that is, the entire volume of the building is calculated as a certain number of cubic feet or a certain number of cubic meters (all volumes from the bottom to the top of the roof). Multiply by the unit price per cubic foot or cubic meter to determine the cost of the building. This method calculates the area, height, depth, size of the foundation, and slope of the roof uniformly, so it is very accurate. The difficulty lies in the fact that the unit price per cubic foot or cubic meter must be accurate and there must be no difference between high and low from the actual value.</p>
<p>In all countries that use this type of estimation, their magazines contain the unit prices of various projects under construction (that is, the construction cost per cubic foot), so that all stakeholders know the value of various buildings and it is easy to compare and estimate the value of other types of projects to be built. (For example, if there is a project whose degree and grade should be similar to a certain project that has been completed, then its price should also be similar, so it can be estimated based on its unit price to calculate it. If there is a slight difference or the distance of transportation is different, then the unit can also be increased or decreased to estimate it.)</p>
<p>(B) Per Square Foot of Floor Space. Using the area of the building as the unit of estimation is also popular in Western countries. Now some people in our country also use this method. If the unit price used is not the appropriate amount, it is easy to cause extreme differences. Therefore, those who use this method to estimate in Beijing and Shanghai call it the general ledger, which is the account of the general situation, which can only be used as a quick estimation method but not a precise estimation method. Therefore, bidding and opening accounts must be opened separately to be based on and not to be excessive loss or gain.</p>
<p>This method only uses the floor area as the standard, regardless of the height of the house, the depth of the foundation, the slope of the roof, etc., so it is definitely not an accurate estimation. However, because it is quick and easy to understand, it is very suitable for engineers and owners to budget, because the engineer's budget has no profit or loss relationship, and the owner must submit the contractor's bid to determine its cost. The engineer's budget can only be used as a reference. Now those who use this method to estimate in Beijing and Shanghai take one British square as a unit, that is, one hundred square feet is one square. For example, a certain building has a floor area of ​​several squares, excluding the area of ​​the balcony, steps, platform, and other scattered works that cannot be included. If each square is a certain number of yuan, then the engineering cost of this building is equal to the unit price multiplied by the number of squares.</p>
<p>(C) The Quantity System of Estimating. This valuation is the most precise, that is, according to the drawings and specifications, the various projects in the building are calculated separately for their volume or quantity, and then the unit project price is estimated with reference to the specifications. After calculating its price item by item, it is then accumulated into the total project cost, so it is very accurate. However, before this type of valuation, the drawings of the building must be read repeatedly and the structure must be recorded in detail, and then the specifications must be consulted, and everything must be understood before each item can be estimated. Otherwise, there will be many omissions, which will easily lead to errors and cause losses. If you want to be precise but easy to make mistakes, it is better than the above three estimations. The easiest way to make this kind of price is to omit or repeat the separate calculations, which are often wrong or forgotten. If you want to avoid this disadvantage, you can also have two people make a paper of estimation and compare and correct it. In the Shanghai-Nanjing area, the method of opening detailed accounts is used in this method. We can understand from this account whether the detailed accounts opened by the contractor are calculated accurately, whether the unit price is appropriate, and whether the contractor understands the specifications in the drawings and specifications. Because this type of estimation cannot list the corresponding quantity and unit price if the drawings are not understood and the specifications have not been read. Generally, the detailed account is to separate each construction project into two parts, for example, the foundation, the number of squares of three-and-earth, the number of yuan per square, the number of squares of large feet, the number of squares of yuan per square, the 20-inch wall, 15-inch wall, and 10-inch wall are also listed separately as quantity and estimated. For example, one hall of the gate, how many double doors, how many single doors, and how many small doors are recorded separately and estimated one by one. Therefore, this type of valuation is the most time-consuming, often failing to complete an estimation in one day.</p>
<p>Combining the above three methods is the most common and practical now, but the old-fashioned valuation in our country is more precise than ever, because its estimation method is to calculate the number of wood roots, the number of brick materials, the number of tiles, the number of stones, the number of stone gray, the number of paper tendons, the number of carpenters, the number of workers, and the number of small workers, and the detailed listing is very precise. However, the results are also in line with those, so they often exceed the budget by a huge amount, or the too precise estimation is easy to cause errors, which is not as good as the above three estimations.</p>
