<h3 id="c57">防疫運動 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— 年</p>
<p>一週以來。氣溫之增加頗驟。據徐家匯觀象台報吿。上海之最髙溫度。九日尙只九十一度零。十日突至九十五度半。及十三日交入初伏達九十七度。十四日乃逾百度。前昨兩日。亦在百度左右。與此有關之消息。見於本報者。一爲各醫院時疫病人之劇增。一爲本市防疫運動之之加緊進行。夫「防」之意義。爲思患而豫爲之備。今在時疫未成。嚴重問題之際。及早謀所以遏止之。實本市　生當局賢明之舉措。爲全國所宜效法者也。</p>
<p>査我國九種法定傳染病中。以三伏期間爲開始發現時節。而其性又極猛烈者爲霍亂病。故謂夏季防疫工作。以防止霍亂之發生爲中心。亦無不可也。此病於民國二十一年曾猖獗於全中國。據有調査之三百餘城市統計。患者達十萬人。死亡數逾三萬。是年上海以住民生活適於此病流行之故。全市染病人數達四千餘。然死亡者只三百十七人。死亡率僅及百分之七點四。（詳民國二十三年申報年鑑）則以上海對於防疫工作之進行。較其他城市爲勞力也。前年及去年。此疫發現甚少其故一由於大規模之防疫注射之收效甚宏。一則爲此疫例須隔三四年大流行一次之關係。（詳髙鏡朗醫師著兒一傳染病書第十五表）</p>
<p>防疫工作之最易着手者。爲普及豫防注射。據衛生設施實騐處金寳善先生爲本報年鑑所編「二十三年防疫設施情形。」上海方面。受豫防注射者。至八月底止。達七十四萬九千餘人。此雖未可遝斷爲是年疫病稀微之唯一原因然其效力所在。亦可以概見。本年上海受注射人數。如前日本報所載尙只二十六萬五千餘人。僅及去年三分之一。此爲防疫運動中上海衛生當局所應注意之事實。而我三百五十萬住於疫病容易發展之地方之人民。更未可因兩年之無疫而玩忽自誤。至於其他各地之有防疫之責者。吾人尤希望其對於普及像防注射一事加以注意。</p>
<p>投病傳染之媒介。爲飮水不潔之食物。蒼蠅。及帶菌人。此數者尤以飮水為　注意。　其餘諸端。凡　具衛生知識者。多能以個人之力阻其傳染若飲水之事雖在倫敦漢堡等公共衛生事業已發展地方尙難免其爲害。上海之　州河。於二十一年大疫中。曾發現抗霍亂之嗜菌體。吾人希望當地衛生常局　就此加以研究。內地人民缺乏衛生知識。水道汚濁。爲害甚鉅。地方行政及　理自治人員。務須及早舉行消毒工作。上海二十三年曾從事於此。方　　何收效如何。亟應就其經騐。發爲宣傳。以資全國仿行也。</p>
<p>記者未見疫血　防疫。或難免無病呻吟之譏。然凡事豫則立。不豫則　。　如見水位增髙而始談防災。必費力多而收效難。殷鑑不遠。國人其汴意焉。</p>

<p>（倫敦）下議院將於下星期二開始討論意阿爭端、國聯會恊會倫敦區代表上議　達維斯勳爵、巳在上院秘書處提出一動議案、要求立卽設法、根據巴黎非戰公約及國聯會盟約、以解决意阿爭端、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）現在外交界調解意阿爭執之努力、在於阻止國聯行政院於七月二十五日開會、有人因此建議、意阿調解委員會在七月二十五日前根據五月二十五日國聯之决議、選擇一新委員、此問題一致承認調解委員會在此時期難望有何成就、但信延長委員會之壽命、俾國聯復得度過一月則儘有時間可資繼續談判、此實係和解意阿爭端之唯一辦法云、（十五日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據聞意相墨索里尼對於召集英法意三國會議、運用一九〇六年三國條約、以討論阿比西尼亞問題、認爲不能達到解决之目的、業已予以拒絕、英國方面乃於上星期杪提出新建議、主張由英法兩國駐羅馬大使與意國政府代表互相磋商、俾得參酌一九〇六年條約研究阿國問題、尤其是將意國在日內瓦方面對阿比西尼亞採取行動時、所依據之法律觀點及實質事件、共同加以討論、關於此層、消息靈通人士指出意國對於阿比西尼亞有若干不滿意處、始終未向國聯會提出、舉其尤者、如阿國雜持奴隸制度及妨害該國與意國屬地間之正常商務關係皆是、故謂阿國迄未履行國聯會盟約所規定之義務實非過甚之辭、目前意大利對於英國新建議尙未答復、據一般人所知、各關係國間現所舉行之談判之目標、與其謂爲目標在於和平解决爭　無寗謂係尋覓方法解釋意國攻擊阿比西尼亞之理由較符眞相也、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>以上所講的幾點、就是說明你們一般青年所應負的責任與應有的修養、想必你們都很明白了、我現在可以用我所常講的兩句話來總括前面所講的道理、就是「生活的目的、在增進全體人類之生活、生命的意義、在創造宇宙繼起之生命」、這就是我們生的意義與目的之所在、上面所講許多話、都可歸結到這兩句話、大家要知道天地父母生育我們、社會國家教養我們、使我們長大成人、讀書職字、到底有什麼價值、為什麼目的、如果為求個人的榮華富貴、求有衣穿有飯吃、就是沒有志氣、沒有出息的人、也不是父母生我、社會國家養我、學校教我的目的、我們要出生長大受教求學的根本目的、是在救國家、救同胞、尤其是為大多數窮苦同胞來謀幸福、為增進全人類的生活、而且人生不過幾十寒暑、終歸要死去、必須我們能上為祖宗父母繼承歷史的生命、下為子孫萬世創造繼起的新生命、使宇宙的新生命、長流進展無極、然後我們軀體、難然死亡、而精神生命、卻能與宇宙相終始、惟有如此、我們的生命、才有真實的意義、我們即做人、一個人便應當過有目的的生活、有意義的生活、因此我們要為增進人群之生活、創造宇宙之生命、而不斷努力、而犧牲一切、比方講現在我們要來努力做剿匪工作、要來做復興民族的革命事業、就是如此、其次、我們要能盡到救國救民的非常責任、必須具備的重要條件、當然很多、但是最要緊的一個條件、就是要先有強健的體魄、有了強健的體魄、然後有強健的精神、能够任重致遠、刻苦耐勞、完成偉大的事業、這是很明顯的道理、大家也一定知道的、我看現在你們一般青年學生的體魄、實在太不好、像今天你們在此地站立不到一小時、況且還是上午不是太陽最猛烈的時候、但是今天就有很多人昏倒了、如此體魄不好、試問何能救國、你們要曉得、現在大家一般青年學生、無不整天整年的和日光空氣冷水門爭、無論怎樣熱、怎樣冷、風怎麼緊、水怎麼深、雨雪怎麼大、總在外面練習賽跑、負重爬山或游泳、這些事情、而且天氣愈熱、雨雪愈是大、他們越是精神　發練習得起勁、所以一般青年能够體魄強健、精神暢旺、整個國家民族也因此很強盛、所以我們今後要做偉大的事業、要救國、亦非加緊嚴鍊體格不可、各校校長教職員各家長、定要注重學生的體育、不要再和從前一樣、聽他們躲在房屋裏不晒日光、不沾雨水、避寒怕熱、養成文弱不堪萎靡不振的病夫、而且為要增進體育、只靠每天　　兩點鐘的操場演或運動、還是不够、一定還要注意舉辦以下各種訓練、第一、課外競賽、凡與身體有益之各種競技、每周要舉行小競賽一次、每月要舉行大競賽一次、以提高學生體育的興趣、養成其運動的習慣、第二、野外演習、如數十里或十餘里的遠足旅行、游泳爬山跑步等演習、都是對體育很有益處的事情、應該時常舉行、第三、露營演習、現在一般童子軍雖聞有露營演習、但是太少、以後不僅童子軍、各校學生、每一個月應該舉行一次、以養成其與自然界門爭的習慣、而使其體魄增強、精神奮發、膽氣豪壯、第四、勞働服務、即如前面所述無論家庭學校的日常生活的事情、凡是他們所能做到與所應做的、都要自己去做、使之養成勞動的習慣、并且還要為父母先生朋友及社會上一般民眾服務、使發揮服務精神、如此也可以使他們得到鍛鍊的機會　、無論如何、學校的教職員和家庭的父兄、總應想種種方法、來鍛鍊自己學生子弟的體魄、使成為一個能與任何艱難危險相奮門的國民、同時還要注重醫藥衛生、預防疾病、萬一學生發生疾病、立即要醫好、每個月并要舉行體格檢查一次、看他們體格強弱的變化如何、對體格增強的人、要特別予以獎勵、使大家注意修養與鍛鍊體格、身體轉弱的人、亦要特別予以警告勸導、使其注意鍛鍊轉弱為強、這是很重要的一件事情、各校長教職員、應該特別注意、此外還有一件關於教育方針的事情、各校長教職員、也應該注意的、就是要提倡生產教育、生產教育最重要的、又是農業生產教育、各學校應該　要特闢一塊園地、以為學生從事補習農作園藝、及飼畜的場所、藉以引起學生勞作的習慣與農業生產的興趣、和知識技能、將來他們畢業回到家鄕、就可以從事農業與飼畜的工作、成為社會國家獨立生產的一員、不為依賴家庭社會的寄生蟲、現在各學校都沒有注意到這一點、實在是教育的一個大缺點、希望負教育責任的人、要想方法做到、各學生也應該明折這個道理、學得這種中國國民必備的謀生的本領、</p>
<p>最後我還有一點意思要貢獻給各大學中學校長教職員的、就是你們　職、應該參照現行法令、組織一個教授團、這一類的共同研究討論的團體、組織的目的、就是要你們一般教職員、無論在首先學問或體格精神各方面、都能與時俱進、能以身作則、為學生的師表、領導他們、使之成為健全的國民、并且要時常舉行全文、討論改進教育、一切切實可行的辦法、就是不能由我們教職員本身做到的事情、亦可提供及教育行政當局的採擇、更須共同一致維持學校的紀律與整個的學風、使教育能够天天進步、關於這個辦法、我的意思很多、今天不能詳說、請你們自己去研究被告、無論如何、希望各位校長教職員總要特別奮勉努力、使成都教育能够日新月異、成為全國教育的模範、希望你們各位一定要拘定這個大宗旨、通往邁進、以達到教育救國的責任、纔不負國家領民眾深切的期望、我自到成都來、已經對各界領袖講過六次話、每次都講到教育的方針與要義、如果你們都能照着切實做去、我相信由於教育之進步、不僅建設新四川不難、而且可以很快的建設出一個嶄新的中華民國、今天因為天氣很熱、你們一般童子軍、平素沒有養成與日光門爭的能耐、已經有很多人支撑不住、所以今天只大槪的講了幾個節目、其中的道理、就是你們各位團長校長和教職員去詳細發揮、來告訴你們各學生、尤其要注意體魄的訓練、至少要下閃召集講話的時候、再沒有一個人昏倒、使大家能够成為正正堂堂的青年學生、與自強自立、具備獨立人格的健全國民、能够繼往開來、挽救我們的國家、復興我人瓣民族不愧為黃帝的子孫與中華民國的國民、（七月十日）</p>

<p>我國電影界前輩鄭正秋氏、突於昨晨七時十分、在慕爾鳴路安吉里四號寓所、以心臟衰弱症逝世、享年四十八歲、鄭氏初年、從事新劇運動、待電影業興起、乃改而致力國產電影之電展、除與張石川·周劍雲·董天涯·等手創明星影片公司任協理之職外、並導演影片達二十三部之多、對社會公共事業、亦多參加、兼任廣東同鄉會副董事長、潮州同鄉會主席及和濟醫院院長等等、中央社記者昨特訪悉鄭氏生前死後各情、分誌如下、</p>
<p>病魔纏綿　遽爾逝世</p>
<p>鄭氏體質素弱、常年為病魔所纏、然因對其事業具有雄心、故伊能年有新片問世、當本月八日、周劍雲·胡蝶·歸國時、鄭猶扶病至明星公司出席歡迎會、並高聲演說、詎料不及旬日、遽歸道由也、鄭宿患心臟衰弱症、因本人為和濟醫院院長、故即請院中西醫生診治、十日起、漸見沉重、十一日加劇、不能談話、十三·十四·兩日、雖略有轉機、但十五日下午、卒瀕於絕境、陷入昏迷狀態之中、昨晨六時許、明星公司同人張石川·周劍雲·等猶在鄭氏病榻前慰問、至七時以告永辭、固未料及於十數分鐘遽爾溘逝也、鄭氏遺體、於昨晨九時半、運抵徐家匯路上海殯儀館、洗沐後、陳於禮堂後殯室中、明星公司同人及鄭氏生前友好、聞耗前往吊唁者、絡繹於途、鄭氏有老母張太夫人、已七十五歲、妻俞孟君、年四十七歲、子三、長小秋、年二十四、次二秋、年十八、幼三秋、年十四、女一、名又秋、除小秋已於明星公司演劇多年外、餘均在民國初級中學肄業、鄭氏大殮、已定十八日下午二時舉行、</p>
<p>早年戲劇　生活濃厚</p>
<p>鄭氏初名伯常、為廣東潮州鉅商鄭洽記之螟蛉子、幼延荘乘黃先生（民國元二年嘗為中華民報撰述社評）教讀、弱冠時、持母金二萬元、來滬業商、顧對於戲劇、在特殊興趣、在清末宣統年間、于右任氏在滬創辦民呼報時、即署名藥風作麗麗所劇談、為中國劇評之始、時徐卓呆等正發起新劇運動、邀往虹口觀日本話劇、鄭興趣大增、不二年、張石川所組亞細亞影片公司失敗、鄭乃襲用其全部人員、組新民新劇社、假座博物院路蘭心大戲院表演、生旦兼長、初未見順利、旋鄭因演後母虐待子女諸劇、大受觀眾歡迎、乃復由張石川合辦民鳴新劇社·笑舞臺、嗣後復與張周等合創明星影片公司、致全力於國產電影、任導演、鄭少年時、賢囊中有小石塊、經德醫設法碎之、於小便中排出、因痛苦過甚、乃染煙癖、數年前、鄭又因惑於德國希米特博士迨老還童之說、與鄭鷓鴣同受試騐、鷓鴣不一年即去世、而正秋身體因此更虧、雖夏令而手冷如冰、最近鄭氏進行戒煙癖、詎料因心臟病加劇、遽爾去世、</p>
<p>投身影界　貢獻頗大</p>
<p>十餘年來、鄭氏在明星導演影片、計達二十三部、雖人有以新劇化病之、然每片賣座、然猶能年出一片、「自由之花」·「姊妹花」·「再生花」·尤為眾口所傳頌、明星公司賴以安渡經濟難關者屢屢、最近、鄭又編就一劇、名「兄弟行」、尚未開拍、目前電影界中、經鄭提攜者頗不乏人、人咸尊之為「鄭老夫子」云、</p>
<p>鄭氏導演　各片一覽</p>
<p>小情人、一個小工人、梅花落、白雲塔、（以上兩片與張石川合導、）二八佳人、血淚碑、楊小真、黑衣女俠（與程步高合導）、俠女救夫人、前集血淚黃花、後集血淚黃花、（以上兩片與程步高合導）刀下美人、戰地小同胞、碎琴樓、桃花湖、紅淚影、玉人永別、春水情波、自由之花、姊妹花、再生花、女兒經、熱血忠魂、（一部係鄭導演）兄弟行、（已編未拍）</p>

<p>滬西小沙渡路一三七一弄一百號門牌為大中華賽璐製造廠、專造兒童玩具及乒乓球等、其貼隣均屬永慶里、該里計分十弄、住戶大半盡屬平民及工人、上月二十八號晚八時餘、該處突然起火、頓時火燄彌天、濃煙密佈、致永慶里一般居民均爭先恐後、紛紛逃避、其不及逃避而被火灼傷並由斃命之男女、迄已有二十六人、尚有受傷者五十三名、實為空前之浩刦、事後</p>
<p>被難災民即組織一被難後援會、並認此次火警為大中華廠堆棧所起、乃延聘王威榖·韋維清·孫拔吾·等律師代表被難家屬吳紹文等四十人、具狀向第一特院刑庭控告該廠經理姜俊彥·協理兼廠長葛天民·副廠長錢孟林·總經理孫洪成·董事長朱如堂·等五人過失致人於死、及傷害公共危險等罪、昨日下午四時一刻、此案由劉毓桂推事蒞刑八庭傳訊、因此案關係重大、故各界</p>
<p>到庭旁聽者頗多、被害人方面、亦大半到庭、男女老幼俱全、均身負創痕、五被告除錢孟林未到外、餘均偕辯護律師徐傑·凌啟鴻·顧永泉·等到案應訴、公共租界警務當局、亦以此案頗關重要、故除派西員到庭記錄各方口供外、並為防務週密、免除意外起見、特由丙區區長西人開乃納·華督察長吳根源·親自督同大批探捕、至法庭內外、會同原有法警</p>
<p>維持秩序、劉推事當以本案告訴人眾多、即命推舉代表數人供述、遂由被難人推舉吳紹文·周德幹·劉松壽·等三人為代表、即據吳紹文、江北人、家住永慶里第八弄、與被告等之大中華廠相距不遠、祗隔一小弄、去年八月一號、該廠曾失火一次、事後我等以全體房客名義、委任王律師致函該廠、要求拆除籬笆、修理風火墻、當時雖允修複、但</p>
<p>未見實行、詎至本年六月二十八號下午八時餘、該廠又告火警、火起於廠中之堆貨房內、該房滿貯爆裂物品、致霹靂一聲、勢極猛烈、火燄四射、延燒至我等所住之永慶里六·七·八·九·十·各弄、其時我正在乘涼、一見火警、因該處並無後門、且火熱極速、刻不容緩、故均從墻上爬至小弄、拼命冒火逸出、其不及者均葬身火窟、是役</p>
<p>被燬房屋十三間、因均屬平民、一間約住數戶、故被災約有二十七戶、燒死男女二十六人、留院治傷者三十人、自除全家被毀外、並燒死五人、現祗剩我一人云云、言下珠淚奪眶而出、請求伸冤、又據周德幹·劉松壽·供述彼兩家各燒死四人、劉家並有二人重傷、現尚留院、餘供與吳紹文類同從略、詰之被告</p>
<p>姜俊彥供、為大華賽璐珞廠經理、該廠西隔壁為永慶里、中隔一小弄、並無墻磚、祗係一籬笆、去年八月一號、雖曾失火一次、但事後並未接到永慶里房客之要求造墻信、且廠中一切之事、均歸廠長負責等語、葛天民供、為大中華廠廠長、如有重要之事、由我報告總經理、轉報董事會核辦、去年火災時、因我並不在廠、由前廠長錢正華擔任、今原告所控錢孟林、我廠中並無其人、故對於原告等</p>
<p>要求造墻等情、全不知悉、查大中華廠非在於廠中、因我廠中之堆積原料貨棧、每日下午六時後即關門下鍵、且並無電燈、何能起火、故我廠亦係被燒者之一、且據外間傳述、火係從永慶里燒來、惟此說我不能提出證據、祗係傳聞而已、劉推事以本院昨因另案、滬西踏勘、經過大中華廠、略加視察、見火</p>
<p>起於廠中之堆棧、葛答稱、實非我廠起火、因我廠中有男女工人一百七八十名、此次除貨棧被燬外、尚燒去爐子間之屋頂、該屋係用煤燃蒸氣、內有二工人、專司其事、每日上午五時開工、下午五時半停工、該貨棧對於爐子間、相距約有三丈餘、現因廠中自火災後、機件損壞、停止工作、惟據外間傳聞、此次火起、實自永慶里第七弄、至其起火原因、聞係因用打氣爐、</p>
<p>煮燒夜飯不慎、致火星延燒於廁所、蔓延至堆棧云云、孫洪成供、我為總經理、專管發行事務、是晚我得廠長報告火警、但我當時並不在塲、朱如堂供、係董事長、是晚得報後、即電詢廠中、據稱、火起永慶里、因打氣爐而起、餘事不知、繼據原告方面證人奏步崑投稱、去年八月一號夜半、該廠失火後、我由房客九十一戶推為代表、延王律師去函、要求</p>
<p>修理墻磚由前廠長錢孟林出而向我接洽、準在四月內修復、後因我赴鎮江、廠中亦未實行前語、故未催告、訊至此、被告代理徐傑等律師即起而聲明該廠設備、經工部局工廠檢查處、不時前往查看、認為滿意、且此次火警、當時經該管普陀路捕房中西探詳細調查、如認被告方面有過失、當然早已提起公訴、此點應請庭長吊閱</p>
<p>捕房報告即可明瞭、劉推事以此案責任未明、尚有調查之必要、並以原告等均民屬貧民、生活維艱、今不幸遭此火災、情殊可憫、故勸諭被告等在庭法上、先行出欵數百元、以作暫時救濟辦法、並非責任問題、被告律師對於此點、表示贊同、惟稱現廠中被各原告估據、致不能工作、最好着令各原告於二三天內全部遷出、俾得工作、再者今原告到庭者頗多、深恐退庭後、對於被告等</p>
<p>有所騷動此點應請注意、劉推事諭本案改期本月二十七號下午四時十分再訊、如認為有踏勘之必要時、再行通知兩造律師到案、四被告各交隨傳到鋪保、在未覔到保狀前、準由辯護律師負責保出、限於明日十二時前補交保狀、並指傳被告錢孟林·即錢正華到案審理、一面為保全秩序起見、着令各原告先行退出、諭畢退庭時已六時、未幾各被告及辯護律師分乘汽車數輛、由捕房中西探捕登車護送而去、</p>

<p>合義務與健康敎育於爐　為意大利掃除文盲之先鋒</p>
<p>—設備簡易足為吾識字運動參考—</p>
<p>（羅馬特訊）吾國近來鑒於文盲為民族復興之障碍、推行識字運動、不餘遺力、意大利之露天學校Souola　Aperta、設備簡易、而收效宏大、殊足爲今日吾國努力義敎聲中良好之參考、上海社社長薛光前、留學意京、特將其組織及活動情形、足爲吾國適用借鑑者、通訊如下、</p>
<p>設立主旨</p>
<p>意大利露天學校之設立主、在於義務及健康敎育之提倡、　家境淸貧及體降弱之兒童、均可免費入內、接受適當之敎育、此項學校完全由國家設立、普遍於各處、而　設立於意京難馬者、歷史最悠久、範圍最廣大、蓋國家認定民族之生命、繫於兒童、處境優越之兒意、自有適當之家庭、爲之養育、可不顧慮、唯獨貧困積弱之兒童、必須由國家出而責任、爲之主意與保護也、</p>
<p>入學資格</p>
<p>凡兒童年自六歲起、至十四歲止、無力入普通學校肄業、或身體孱弱、常陷入不健康之狀態中、經醫生檢騐合格、適宜於此種學校生活者、均可入學、不納分文、每日由校方派車早晚接送、此項接送之責任、由每街之街長擔任之、（按意大利法西斯黨黨員、於每一街上、有一街長、以服務公衆爲唯一職責）、無須家長自己操心、中午並市校方供給午膳　餐、亦屬免費、雖僅一湯一菜、所費極少、顧滋養充足、極尙衛生、</p>
<p>學校設備</p>
<p>學校設備、至爲簡單、大都設於露天之大花園、內間有木屋　數間、亦極簡陋、所以聊蔽風雨之用、此殆露天學校之所由名歟、兒童服裝、女孩則一衣一褲、別無長物、男孩則僅穿一褲上身爲裸體、（冬日則穿一羊毛單衫）日常讀書操作、令部生息於陽光化日之下、蓋唯如是、方能增進兒童對大自然之興趣、以裨益於身心體力也、學校除應有之敎師外、並有醫生若干名、對兒童之營養與衛生、時時加以嚴切之注意與檢騐、吾人知意大利兒童之標語、爲『書』與『槍』唯智識充實體格强健者、方爲理想的健全的國民也、</p>
<p>活動情形</p>
<p>學校之活動、一以兒童直接操作爲主要原則、敎師完全處於指導合作地位、全校兒童、分六人爲一組、担任洗掃淸潔、並烹飪中餐等事、若中膳一餐、四人共一小桌、所有佈置食其、分送飯萊洗擦碗碟等等、槪由兒童自己担任、此外、學校中滿植各種花菓蔬菜、亦均由兒童灌水栽植、蓋此輩兒童、旣來自窮苦之家庭、則凡此所習所學者、均可歸而有助於父母之操作也、至上訝時以不用書本爲原則、敎師口頭講解、年稍長者、並須爲之筆記、至所有一切應用之讀物與紙筆材料、亦概由學校全部發落、</p>
<p>經費來源</p>
<p>意大利復興之關健、在於事事能經濟化、合理化、用能以最小數之代價、獲取最大數之利益、於最短促之時期、進求最宏大之成效、露天學校其一也、露天學校之事業雖鉅、顧國家所費之經濟至有限、蓋其地址、爲一露天之空地、假自公家、不需納費、（或向私家之公園接洽、要求開放借用）、所有建築簡單校屋校具之木材、與敎材上應用之一切物件、概由學校向各方勸募、集掖成裘、積少成多、蓋各方亦深知露天學校所以爲救濟貧困孳弱之兒電而設、人人亦自願各盡其力、以完成人類互助的精神與義務也、査意利於墨索里尼執政之前、文盲遍地、略等於今日之中國、（據統計意大利南部薩定尼阿省、不識字者居百分七十以以）、而今智識發達敎育普及、考其致此之由、露天學校實為此中最有力之先鋒工具、今日中國、旣深感掃除文盲之急不容緩、對茲意大利實行已見大效之露天學校、殊有採擇參考之餘地、惟以中國財政之困難、而需要建設之事業、尤千溶萬端、故今日舉辦一事、如何使之經濟化合理化、以一人做二人事、一錢作二錢川、實爲一切一切之前提、識字運動特舉其一端耳、</p>

<p>— 張慕良</p>
<p>天乍明乍暗的還沒有亮得完全，什麽都怪沉寂的。但，裏虹橋糞碼頭已擠滿了那些男人，女人，把許多躺在糞碼頭上的糞車，一輛輛的出動了；長列的糞車陣，在柏油路上，發出軋軋的叫聲。</p>
<p>太陽緩緩地從雲翳裏漏出紅臉，於是裏虹橋徐徐的熱閙起來了，十七十八路的無軌電車開始走動它的路綫，裏面塞滿了一批批辦公的人和趕早市的人。</p>
<p>一刹那間，一般拿着書包的男女學生，和提着菜籃的買小菜的人們，絡繹不絕的在裏虹橋經過，每個人有各個不同的姿熊。</p>
<p>尤其是一般異國的流浪者（羅松人）和叫化　三們特別的活躍起來；異國的流浪者學了一口純粹的華語，向着貼面的華人討錢，想換得天的醉飽；叫化　三們討錢的法子，他們等著坐黃包車的朋友經過橋的時候，便幫着車夫拉過這頂橋，然而再向坐黄包車的朋友討錢，這情形和老閘橋天后宮橋一般無二。</p>
<p>紅色的福特卡，怪高聳的，上面架了一支機關槍，坐着九個巡捕，多麽威風啊！後面跟着一輛灰色的福特卡，迅速地疾馳到裏虹橋，叫化癟三們以及異國的流浪者都嚷起來了：「喂：赤老的車子來啊，快出鬆啊！」</p>
<p>跟着驚惶似的叫喚，馬路上秩序大亂起起來了，聲勢汹汹的巡捕老爺已經像老鷹捉小雞似的抓到好幾個了，路上看閑的人也都不約而同的聚了攏來。</p>
<p>盜警車已塞滿了那些叫化癟三和異國的流浪者，便可鈴可鈴的去了，於是裏虹橋的空氣暫時也感到平靜了一些。</p>

<p>— 紀一介</p>
<p>偶憶「寗作太平犬，莫爲亂世人」的兩句俗諺，聯想到幾種狗的生活</p>
<p>一種是養尊處優的哈叭狗，這種狗最少，千分之一怕還沒有，它的主人，不是外國人，就是摩登女郞，它過慣舒適的生活，飽食終日，無所事事，食則有牛肉土司雞蛋等品，寢則洋房，且有鋼絲牀，或美麗的羊毛羢毯子，有時還得坐汽車，它的物質的享受，同尋常一切的狗比較起來，眞所謂天差地遠了。</p>
<p>一種是差堪溫飽的灶下狗，卽草狗，這種狗亦不多，不過百分之十，它依着廚司爲生活，雖不得吃牛肉雞蛋，而白米飯殘羹冷炙，每食可供一飽，雖不得睡羊毛毯，坐汽車，而軟柴堆中亦足取煖，比較其他的狗，要安適多多。</p>
<p>一種是勞工式的看家狗，亦草種居多，這種狗較多，大約占百分之十五至二十，它所受的待遇却很苛刻，食則粗糲，至多菜湯肉骨，臥則靑石板，或水門汀，比灶下狗又等而下之了。</p>
<p>一種是失業般的野狗，它是沒有主人的，現在這種狗最多，幾乎觸目皆是，終日街頭奔馳，雨淋日炙，竟不得一飽，不得已向垃圾堆或厠所中覓　穢果腹，爲狗類中之最不幸最可憐者。</p>
<p>總括的說一句，在現代不景氣籠眾的世界上，莫說是人，做狗亦受到影響的</p>

<p>因爲當今天早上，我初被召進宮來的時候，太后已曾吩咐我用手撫過伊的前額，藉以試騐伊的體溫；此刻伊想出去，我便自動的講伊讓我試試伊的體溫。伊立刻就允許了；但我一試之後，却很覺尷尬。原來伊的寒熱雖然已比早上减了許多，但畢竟還不曾恢復常度，我的掌心覆在伊的前額上時，仍覺得有些發燙；再瞧伊的精神，也是依舊不甚爽朗。我原是很熱心而且對伊很關切的人，便不得不力進幾許忠吿。</p>
<p>「老佛爺，請你暫時再忍耐一會，可行嗎」？我說道：一你的寒熱還不曾退盡咧！最好不要吹風；到長廊下散步固然要比坐在宮內開暢一些，可是難免就要受風，而且也太辛苦了」！</p>

<p>「白頭姑娘，」在同族方面，一般小輩們，都稱他是「×伯伯，」使女小婢，或竟叫他一聲爲「太小姐，」他的身分雖未出閣，居在尊長地位，凡是銀錢出入的會計，日常費用的開支，倘不依他的預算，不論那一個少爺和少奶奶，分毫不得擅動，所以「白頭姑娘，」自從雙親死後，在這三十年裏頭，遺下來的田房屋產，保管得一些沒有欠缺，非但用度已足够開銷，而且還等着嗣過來的小兄弟成年後，娶妻完姻，保持一姓的血系，這不是很可敬的一件事嗎？在鄰里間，聽到「白頭姑娘」的名聲，有的見他能够一霸拿權，贊他是個「女中丈夫，」有的看他長於把家，尊他是個復興×姓的「英雌，」莫不嘖嘖稱羨；你，倘若不提起「白頭姑娘」便罷，要問到「白頭姑娘，」哼！可以敢說在本地方誰都知道呢</p>
<p>今年某報載着是「老頭兒結婚年，」有一天，被「白頭姑娘」看見了，他笑道：唉！這是恐怕記者們登錯題目了；什麼緣故呢？不看見嫁老頭兒的，都是「老小姐」麽？然而那班「老小姐，」起先個個抱着終身不嫁主義的，年歲到了半百，不知爲了怎的，反要做一、回羞答答的「新嫁娘，」我終覺得有些不很明白，這幾句話，「白頭姑娘，」說得眞十分的幽默，故我代他做了這篇小傳，以見「白頭姑娘，」確是名不虛傳啊！</p>

<p>— 朱</p>
<p>當我在報紙上瞧到溫小霞自殺的新即，心絃不禁突突亂跳。小霞是我的一個鄰居小友，他那圓潤的面龐，和嬌怯怯怕羞的態度，都覺得可愛；然而這樣一個靑年，竟至在旅館中自殺，不由我瞧着報上的遺影，心中充塞着無限的悵惘。</p>
<p>小霞雖是小戶人家的子弟，然而他是那麽聰明，那麽好學，當我沒有搬家以前我和小霞是常在一起遊玩，後來我搬家以後，因着生活的驅逼，和小霞是逐漸疏還了。然而我在他通信裏，知道他在一家綢緞店裏學業，在五年裏面，因他的謹愼聰明，已由學徒升任了外賬席的副手。這樣一個前程大有希望的靑年，竟會自殺，使我不禁起着滿腔懷疑。</p>
<p>我爲了報紙上對於小霞自殺的原因，是失業和無家可歸，像小霞這般謹原的靑年，而他服務的店又沒有閉歇，怎麽會失業及無家可歸呢。我爲要證實死友的死因，預備到他自殺的旅館裏作一次實地探訪，可是我還沒有起身，綠衣的郵差，却已將小霞最後的絕命書送到了我的手中。</p>
<p>我用着抖抖的手將小霞潦草筆跡的信封扯開；裏面係兩張旅館中的用箋，字跡是那麼草率。信上劈頭一句，寫着：「親愛的雲哥，小霞是自殺了！」接着寫：「我這信到哥的手中時，我自殺的新聞，已先映進哥的眼簾了。我的自殺原因，說起來哥或者不會相信。然而我的確爲了荒唐過份，爲商店辭歇，被家庭驅逐。這事的起因，還是在去年夏季，那一天我在電影院裏遇見了殺我的劊子手蘭英；他，是時常到我們店中買衣料的主顧，和我原彼此認識，這時，我倆旣並坐在一起，他又實在美得要命，於是我們由講電影，逐漸地講到一切，他太迷人了，一塲影戲，我們竟成了朋友。雲哥，我原自命爲多情人，蘭英又實在太迷人，在當時那樣的美人，肯做我的情人，我是認爲何等光榮，就時時和伊同遊。這時我對於店務，當然不放在心上，並且我爲經濟的敷用，在我經手的欵項內，逐漸地虧宕，結果半年光陰，竟虧空二百餘元，幸虧業師心好，僅僅將我辭歇，那筆宕欵，却沒有嚴厲追索。我回家後，父母當然氣得半死，然而我正熱戀想蘭英，反覺無職一身輕，不過我旣毫無進欵，蘭英處又不能不化錢，於是我就不顧一切，將家中値錢的東西，一再偷出盜賣，終至給父親重重打了一頓，驅逐出門。而蘭英呢，得了我被逐的消息，竟也和我絕交。雲哥，我本想去投軍，然而我的身子，已糟蹋得孱弱不堪，還能幹什麼事呢。完了！一切完了，什麽戀愛，實在是誘人自殺的死路罷了！小霞絕筆。」</p>
<p>我瞧完這信，雙手抖得握不住好沾滿眼淚的信箋，聽那濕的信箋，落在地上，再也無力拾取。</p>

<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>我在「看到想到」一文裏，曾經說及現在那些浮浮沈沈，糊糊塗塗的思想，是由儒道和禪理混合而成的，但並沒有說明這混合的經過。夏夜苦熱，臭虫作祟，翻來覆去終是睡不着，索性起來，扭亮電燈，再來伸說幾句。</p>
<p>大概當佛敎傳入中國的時侯，儒門子弟，老莊信徒，大家都很看不起牠，主要的原因是：佛祖並不是「黃裔」——自然也未必便是蚩尤的子孫，但旣非中土之產，就無論如何是胡敎，不該提倡的。</p>
<p>站在儒道的立塲上，反對佛敎的，現在大家知道有一個韓愈。這固然是因爲他在這上面吃過大虧，弄出名了，但他的理論竟得爲後世所熟知，則大半倒還是由於他會做幾句古文，而那古文又被大家認爲「足資矜式」，互相傳誦的緣故。其實在韓愈那個時候，儒道和禪理的混合，旱已由形式轉到心理，根深柢固了。但看「三敎同源說」的收效之大，就可以想見一二。</p>
<p>佛敎的所以能够在中國佔到優勢，是因爲牠曾經抓住過幾位帝王的信仰。至於和儒道相混合的緣故，推測起來，大概是由於那些大臣們的倡導。讀過幾卷儒書，引經据典，終不忘記自己是聖人之徒，但又不好過拂「上」意，這才儒服禪心，不僧不俗，弄出個三敎同源，佛儒一致來，這原是騙騙自己的。到了漢末晋初，才有牟子的理惑論和孫綽的喩道篇，都倡言佛儒思想的一致。喩道篇說：</p>
<p>「周孔卽佛，佛卽周孔，蓋內外名之異耳。……佛，梵講也，晋時訓爲覺；覺，悟也，孟軻以聖人爲先覺，其旨一也。周孔匡救時弊，佛敎唯明其本，爲其首尾，其致不殊。故尋於逆者，每見其二，通於順者，無往不一。」</p>
<p>觀乎此，可見佛儒兩敎，在混合的當初，就已經不免於牽强糊塗了。和事老的苦心，在這里是昭然的。</p>
<p>晋以來因於時局不靖，讀孔孟書的士大夫，羣趨消極，於是「佛卽周孔」的論調也愈益發展了。穿儒服，掛念珠，就成了那時候的時髦裝束；甚而還有人在臨死的當兒，左手拿着孝經，右手拿着小品法華經，以表示他的兩無所偏。</p>
<p>不過懷疑佛儒未必一致的人，恰也並非沒有。例如譙王尙之給張新安的信里說：</p>
<p>「佛敎以罪福因果，有若影響，聖言明審，令人寒心。然自上古帝皇，文武周孔，典謨訓誥，靡不周備，未有述三世，顯敘報應者也。彼衆聖皆窮理盡性，照曉物緣，何得忍視陷溺，莫肯援接，曾無一言，示其津逕？且釣而不綱，戈不射宿，博碩肥腯，上帝是享。以此觀之，蓋所難了。……」</p>
<p>此後唐朝的博奕也曾以「佛說爲中國詩書所未有」作爲辟佛的理由之一；韓愈也曾說佛「口不言先王之法言，　不服先王之法服，不知君臣之義，父子之情。」來作爲佛敎和儒道不相容的證據。然而辟者自辟，佛儒一致的論調恰還是無孔不入，但看唐宋人的筆記里，就常常記着那一個和尙是王逸少的子孫，那一個和尙是謝靈運的後裔，在證明他原有讀書種子。那時候的流風所至，雖然不至於脫去儒冠便見光頭，但思想上恰早已打成一片了。所以宋儒辟佛，就弄到「坐在禪床上罵禪」，暗受其毒而不自知。</p>
<p>元明以下，迄於近代，表面上佛敎雖然好像已經中落，但事實上呢，禪理混入儒道，佛法浸漬人心，同聲同氣，倒是變做一家，不見痕跡了。此所以現在那些遺老遺少，雖然讀過子書，自居道統，但大都懂得一點小乘大乘，在騰挪不得的時候，還會引用玄理，作色空觀；抱着得過且過的念頭，裝聾作啞，一直到糊糊塗塗的死亡。</p>
<p>宋朝的理學家程頤批評釋氏說：「昔之惑人也乘其愚暗，今之惑人也因其高明。」這話是不錯的。</p>

<p>— 德國施托謨著陳隱之譯</p>
<p>已經把脚踏在船緣，立刻就要走上船去，但她突然　疑起來，掉轉頭來看我們。兩顆異　風味的黑眼睛，我曾經見過的，但好久沒見了，此時正同我的眼光接觸了；我現在知道她　是雷娜麗·波力嘉。她長大了，褐色面頰之下現出一點不含糊的處女底紅晕；但她仍然保持那種特有的溫雅的疏懶惰態，這情態曾經不知不覺地迷亂了我的小孩子底心。我心中沸熱起來，幾乎把身旁那些貴婦人完全忘記了。那對黑色眼睛似乎帶有懇求態度來看我；我聽見那個老年女裁縫如何勸她，船夫如何不用文雅的話催她促上船；但這細長的褐色姑娘還是站住不動，像做夢一般，把眼睛轉向我。</p>
<p>像被一種莫名其妙的自然力所推動一樣，我巳經向那條渡船走過幾步去了；但我壓制住自己；我想起了克里斯多夫；他的誠實的藍色眼睛似乎突然出現在我眼前了。「那條船容不下我們這些人了，」我對那些貴婦人說。然後我們從側面沿着海岸走向另一隻渡船去。——但我還回頭看了娜麗一次。她把頭垂下胸前，慢慢地走過甲板到船底內部去；這船在金黄色夕陽映照之下於平靜的水面上躺着。</p>
<p>在渡船駛回時候，我坐在船舵旁邊，沒有多說話，心中十分不寧；我的眼睛總瞅住那隻在前面距離很遠的駛動着的渡船，那些年輕的太太們想法要引我同她們閒談，但總不成功。</p>
<p>一您今天怎麼這樣沒有用！她們當中有一個人說，「我們那偭美貌的女裁縫彷彿把您的魂靈攝去了！」</p>
<p>「娜麗是您的女裁縫麽」？我迷惘地問。</p>
<p>「娜麗！您怎麽知道她呌做娜麗」？</p>
<p>「我和她生長在同一個城裏；我第一次的『瑪茲卡舞』就是在跳舞學校中和她合跳的。」</p>
<p>「原來如此！—所以有人說她現在還喜歡同大畢生跳舞」。</p>
<p>我們關於娜麗的談話便到這裏爲止了；但我現在明白克里斯多夫爲甚麼不願意多說娜麗底事情。</p>
<p>後來在冬季裏，我還好幾次看見他在公共塲所同娜麗走在一塊，時常都有那個跛脚瑪麗陪伴着，有時則是一個更老的女人陪伴着；道人，我猜就是那個承受遺產的姨母，她在可憐的法國裁縫將死之前不久，把他的心上寳貝帶走了。</p>

<p>— 龍貢公</p>
<p>一個初春的濕潮的下午，我非常痛苦地想起一個離得很遠的朋友。我不知道我這個朋友會唱「風流寡婦」這首小歌算不算是一個缺點，只是迫切地需要聽牠——這樣，我底回憶會更明晳些，我們中間的隔離會較短些，於是我就走進一家電影院去看用這首小歌做名字的一部片子去了。</p>
<p>但在那里，我却發見了別樣東西。</p>
<p>在黑暗裏摸索着，大聲說着話，兩個男人和一個女人走了進來。女人手裏抱着一個小孩子，男人們都穿着長衫。我一點都看不見他們底面貌，只是感到他們給我一種壓迫，他們是快活的，舒適的，自由的，彷彿他們現在正坐在自己的客廳裏。</p>
<p>那女人底處境非常困難。想出各種法子對她底小孩子低聲恐嚇，哄騙，想制止那些不停的吵鬧。她底法子不能見效的時候，她就站起來，把孩子抱到外面去，避開其他一些觀衆底不滿的聲音，她要不停地一出一進地奔波着，因此她是不安而忙碌的。</p>
<p>那兩個男人比他們底堂客說了更多的話，關於做生意的，看戲的，天氣的。他們底對話短而輕快，而且說得很急，問話和回答好像不曾有過間斷地出於同一個人底口裏。沒有衝突，沒有見解上的差異，對任何事情都首先是連聲好好，——根據這些，我漸漸幻想出他們底面貌，推測出他們是兩個小商人了。</p>
<p>「看戲嗎還是看影戲好……</p>
<p>「淸靜」！一個人那樣說，別一個人就這樣回答。後者又提出意見：</p>
<p>「看片子嗎還是看外國片子好……」</p>
<p>「淸爽」！前者也用同樣的口調回答了。</p>
<p>他們非常融洽地交談着，一直到希佛萊跟麥唐娜調情的時候。這一對情入同坐在一張椅子上，希佛萊向她說出動情的求愛的話來，於是麥唐娜受了激動，身體不安地在坐位上移動着，臉上現出困惑，迷亂的表情來了。對於這一件事，那兩個小商人用惋惜的，近於「憐香惜玉」的感情提出他們底肯定的批評：</p>
<p>「氣煞了」！</p>
<p>「呵，氣煞了」！</p>
<p>當一個小商人震驚於自己的才能，和滿意的發見的時候，他底生命力常常發展到最高限度，而露出可驚的執拗來的。在幾秒鐘之間，旁邊有兩個大學生喊他們閉嘴，於是他們幾個人就不顧一切地爭吵起來了</p>
<p>到那個時候我才很明白地實感到，看影戲不是一椿容易的事。人和人呢，因為種種的限制和障礙，就是面對面也難得互相瞭解的。</p>
<p>所以文壇上，也有過把勞萊或哈台看成卓別麟，而說着種種讚美話的事。</p>

<p>— 徐盈</p>
<p>那一天晚上，我們的「農民茶園裏」的人來得特別多，自從今天周鬍子上午給我一個「釘子」之後，一傳十，十傳百，凡是一個知道這消息的人，沒有不抽空來一趟茶園聽聽我的「講演」</p>
<p>六點三刻，我來到茶園，百十隻眼睛立刻把我當做焦點，說的笑的，唱的，呌的，一切都自動停止了，從來未有的好秩序。我坦然地走進去，他們很客氣的讓開路一條。當定進時，我偷眼看看，周鬍子裂着嘴，滿臉都是髙興，陳老三，擠在另一個角落裏正在指指劃劃地說什麼，低低地。</p>
<p>差十分鐘才到講演的時間，我先坐在我的座位上，茶房送來一杯茶，我便安然地吃着等時間。茶園裏裏外外是佈滿了緊張的神情，空氣十分嚴肅，像在弓弦上的箭，弓巳經開得滿滿的的我偷眼詳察四周的表示，一部份同情我的都有點戚然，而平素不滿意我的人却都有點揚揚自得了。</p>
<p>鐘到七點，茶房丁噹丁噹地把鐵鈴鐺搖起來，我立起身來，先問一句，「陳村長在不在」？</p>
<p>陳老三，忙應着，扣着長杉的扣子從人羣裏擠出來，小頭禿頂，長長身材，傴着腰向我連速點頭，忙走到講演桌前。</p>
<p>「陳村長」，我笑着說，「今天就比如兩方打官司，就請陳村長作個公正人，周大哥想必在這裏，就請周大哥先來報吿一下，兄弟的話要留到最後」。</p>
<p>「好，好，好，」陳老三，急得頭上流汗，手中的小摺扇頻頻扇。「尚大哥，周大哥，你來，你先來。……」</p>
<p>周鬍子就立起身來，笑，鬍子嘴開了花。我依然坐在原位上吃口茶，先聽他報吿。</p>
<p>他是這樣指手劃脚地說的，喉嚨很大。</p>
<p>今天早上李先生在看工人耕田，我過去說，「你不配作農事指導員？」「你作的比不上農人，你還配指導農人」？「老子作個樣子給你看，咱倆人比，你耕一條田，我耕一條田，誰耕得直，誰耕得深，誰耕得快，誰作指導員」！「後來，我赢了，李先生說他今天晚上把農事指導員的位子讓給我。諸位隣居大哥都來作個證。我們作田的人，可見不是沒起色」！</p>
<p>周鬍子的氣勢有點洶洶逼人，說完了抱拳帶笑給大家拱拱手。立刻人羣中嘩然一聲地喊「好」！嘈雜。</p>
<p>陳老三彷彿氣勢也雄壯一點，更又笑着對我說「請，李先生」！</p>
<p>我本來在肚子裏的一套話，在這局勢下是不能用，，槍來須用劍擋，鷄蛋絕不能碰石頭，我只得也硬起來。</p>
<p>我從板凳上了茶棹，我立定身，先不開口，且把羣衆全體看一過，這時候正在落日，室內金紅色很顯赫。於是，人靜了，沒聲音。</p>
<p>「周大哥」，我說，「眞是好本領，我知道　周大哥不單耕地耕得好，種起稻來也是刮刮　，我兄弟實在佩服。不過——</p>
<p>我大聲說，是一氣喊出來——</p>
<p>「農事指導員就會種稻行嗎？周大哥種起麥來，就有點差！他認識這一帶的樹種嗎？更　！種菜不會，養蠶馬虎，開山不懂，你們要　種只會耕一條直地的指導員？若說耕一條直地，諸位大哥，那個不像周大哥，那個不比兄弟强？他能作，那個不能作？</p>
<p>「你們想想，這個指導員是他作還是，我作？請說」！</p>
<p>我又把羣衆看一過，沒有說話的人，周鬍子臉色突然變了，瞪着眼睛看我，我說：「周大哥，對不起，兄弟改日再讓你」。</p>
<p>我說完，便離開，跟後是一片嘈雜。我不再留心他們說什麽。</p>
<h3 id="c201">蚊子 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 陳子展</p>
<p>夏季特別繁殖的小蟲，最惹人討厭的，莫過於蒼蠅，臭蟲，蚊子。蚊子雖沒有蒼蠅那麼骯髒，臭蟲那麼陰險，可是他們聚在一處，便發聲成雷，夜裏擾人淸夢，討厭又甚於蒼蠅，臭蟲。記得在金樓子裏面，說是「齊桓公臥柏寢，謂仲父曰，白鳥營營，是必餓耳。開碧紗廚進之。」白鳥就是蚊子，語出大　禮，夏小正。大約用紗帳隔開蚊子，由來已久。齊桓公議一羣餓嗷嗷的蚊子飛進碧紗廚。這也可以算是仁者的用心了，雖說未免有點迂腐。又記得南宋大詩人范成大有題爲苦蚊的一首小詩：</p>
<p>白鳥營營夜苦飢，不堪薰　出窗　。小蟲與我同憂患，　腹驅來敢倦飛？</p>
<p>這位「望　百僚，名滿四海」的「大參相公」，居然關心到蚊子的肚皮飢餓，頗有反對　蚊子之意．他還說是「小蟲與我同憂患」，似乎　眞有「民胞物與」那麽廣大的同情心。他這句詩的意思，我曾不傷物主的偷用一次。有一個坐過監獄的小姐吿訴我，她在獄中做了一篇祭麻雀文，因爲一隻麻雀飛入獄中，找不着出路，碰壁死了。我聽了很感動，就隨手爲她寫了一首小詩，贈給她。詩云：</p>
<p>恥向深林寄一枝，决飛控地壯而悲。祗應與爾同憂患，不祭臯陶祭雀兒！</p>
<p>這位小姐說我頗有一點人道主義者的精神，其實，我不懂得什麼呌做主義。據說有些人道主義者連臭蟲蚊子之類的小生命都須愛護的，如漫畫名家豐子愷先生的護生畫集就是一例，可是遺忘了人。我却不如此，愛捉臭蟲，愛拍蒼蠅，愛薰蚊子。倘若靑蛙烏　果然好吃，我又吃得慣，吃不到燕窩魚翅，吃不到鷄甲鴨魚肉，拿靑蛙烏龜之類充數，也未見得殘忍，不仁。我在幼小的時候，極其瘦削，真是可說「弱不勝衣，」醫生說是患的貧血症，因此我　最恨吸我血液的臭蟲，蚊子。我生在長沙西鄉，鄉下人最恨臭蟲，那家有臭蟲，好像男盜女娼一般的可恥。我進城以後，也還有怕說自己床上有臭蟲，捉臭蟲定爲日課，但在日課表上寫作「劉蜰」。有一次，被一個稍懂文字學的人，又把我的「劉　」傳爲笑話。至於蚊子呢，鄕下太多，夏天傍晚，到處嗡嗡。有時呼吸快了，鼻孔裏便塞進蚊子。有時開口說話，蚊子又闖進喉頭。城裏蚊子較少，但比起上海來，長沙就算是蚊子頂盛的地方了。記得在南史后妃傳裏，說是梁武丁貴嬪少時和鄰近女孩在月光底下一道紡續，那些女孩部被蚊子咬得可憐，只有貴嬪並不覺得，大約蚊子早知道她是貴人，所以就不叮她了罷！同書循吏傳，說楚孫謙「自少及老，歷二縣五郡，所在廉潔。居身儉素，施　蒢屛風。冬則布被莞席，夏日無幬帳，而夜臥未嘗有蚊蚋，人多異焉。」蚊子也知道奬勵廉潔，這不能不說是一件怪事了。然而我們也不可太老實，信人太過，須知史家所記，未必件件可以當眞，不僅蚊子不咬廉吏一事而已也！</p>

<h3 id="c202">妓女簡教班 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 宸</p>
<p>日前報載南昌專電云：「普及簡易教育會主辦妓女簡教班，十三日晨行開學禮，到妓女百余人，各發三民主千字課一本，教聽來人訓話，謂希按時上課，須知不識字即不明禮義，望努力自勉等語。」</p>
<p>娼妓這門東西，已成了現在社會隨伴而行的贅物，正因為是「贅物」，一般社會人士對之，頗為毀　不一。許多章　熟客，不惜唇舌，爛費筆墨，花下留名者無諭矣，就是好多地方，商家賴此以維持「市面繁榮」，反對禁娼，當局以「花捐」作一筆政務開消，難於率爾從事，都是足以表示這一「贅物」不是怎樣能夠容易解決的問題。</p>
<p>近來有不少以世道人心為憂的人，總覺娼妓為有誤蒼生貽害社會的物事，是以各地有「肅清煙賭娼運動」之舉。一時開會剪彩致訓辭展覽物品嗚鐘放炮，蔚然大觀，頗為熾盛，當然這是「功在社會」，不失美舉，我們舉手贊成。娼妓如盛行，誘拐　　之風必因之普遍，其陷婦女於悽苦黑暗生活，為罪一也；無數老少，冶遊浪蕩，費時廢業，德行日隳，其甚者身敗名裂，蕩家破產，實不勝枚興趣，其罪二也：至若導人民於奢靡，婦女有用的身體，卻相競去作「不生產的勞動」，間接影響到國家社會，都不能不說是這一病態現象。其能因這一「運動」而「錄清」。不論「為國為民」，均屬有百利而無一弊。</p>
<p>不過問題卻不這樣簡單，娼妓的發生是許多婦女業已失去了生活的機會與技能。最後只有出賣肉體，欲求其「肅清」，在婦女方面，就只有給與她們以生活的機會與能力。我想南昌普及簡易教育會的開辦妓女簡教班，目的或亦在此。而且只有這樣才能使陷於悲慘黑暗的妓女受惠。</p>

<p>不管天氣多熱，在這裏，頭上的帕子是不能免掉的，為了焦急，最後，他把頭上的那塊帕子去掉了，頂門上，熱氣蒸鍋樣的噴着。真的，這每天確定了的站頭，伕子們的故意拖延，他是不能卸去這催促的責任的。</p>
<p>鮮紅的太陽，那麼嬌弱的，由山坡的邊上跌進了低小的窗口，在黝黑裏映射着一點兒輝光。這，是在告訴着時間已經不早了，我們，一個個的都爬了起來，作着上路的準備。</p>
<p>——三伕頭，前頭開出去多少了？鐵刷着牙，問着。</p>
<p>——十個挑，八個花籃槓，十七個擔子，還有的正紮，轎子，滑杆，也都預備好了。他笑着，太陽收去了先前的鮮紅，偷偷地瞧着他那紫黑色的臉。</p>
<p>——來，預備走，到大田壩吃早飯。張伕頭前后的嚷。</p>
<p>——大田壩，還有多少路？我問。</p>
<p>——邁過前面分水嶺的山頭，還有六里。</p>
<p>嘈嘈擾擾的一羣，在一陣極度騷亂以後，離開了古樸的小鎮，開始的，在羊腸似的山道上行進了。</p>
<p>四周，這樣肅穆的，瀑流多清脆，幽谷又多深邃，山坡，翠綠的，流雲，漂渺的，農歌，鳥語，這幽揚的音波，在顯示着山野的柔美。</p>
<p>伕子們，是慣用術語的，在他們的術語中，相互的應答着如何　避的事物。</p>

<p>— 吉</p>
<p>已經是十足的夏天了：早上天邊飄着一片濃厚的金黃色的霞云，鳥兒疎疎落落地投出一兩聲清閑的鳴叫，這聲調打在人底將醒的　夢裏，像遠處的關山外面的洋琴上的弦索的怨情，人是多容易地會想起塞外的枯寂的生況，而跟着，又多快地想到如花的南方土地上的繁盛大樹；樹枝上棲止着好些不知名的鳥兒，靜靜地用尖啄在理着睡起的羽毛，間或也近着是風唧唧地叫一兩聲，企圖用近似弦索的聲音來敘述宿晚的歡樂與離合的夢的詩篇啊。</p>
<p>跟着有誰在近霞云的地平綫之上方的太空中，輕輕地打了一條紅綫的記號，這是預示着未來的這一整日是怎樣的一個好天氣啊！於是：在一剎間，在朱綫的印痕處綻出了赤金一般的光流，這，射照在這青色的太空，由近而遠，不久就把一片曠大的天　成一面雪亮的鏡</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>子；於是，在那邊，在地平綫的盡頭、在遠處的東方的無人之海灘上，一個火熱的太陽跳躍一樣地騰了起來，接着整個的大地也由清涼溫暖，而溫暖而微熟，由微熟而沸騰起來了。</p>
<p>一個新的日子開始了，一個夏天的日子啊。</p>
<p>熱氣是無休止地强大起来，它炎炎着大地，督促它底滋長與進益。之後便讓豐實的秋天來做長成之努力的獎品。但，縱然這樣，奔馳在這烤炙一般的土地上的生物該有着多少的苦惱啊！太陽是開始開在督察的崗位上了，在鄉間，農家的男女與孩子，帶了一個吃得半飽的肚子，一雙疲倦的眼睛，一種對生活的本身之厭倦與怨恨的心情；彎着背，哚着嘴，恨恨地走向田野去。在那兒，他們將用他們底汗水去潤濕這些矌闊的，堅硬的，乾枯的，固執與無情的土地，把它們一塊塊地整理起來，翻鈀起來；他們每年必得首先用自家兒們的金錢與勞力來担保這一年的收成；但是在這些日子裏，從過去的事實得知：這乾枯的，固執而無情的土塊，却又是多渺茫，多不可靠的一種貨借人啊。在這火炙一般的夏天，人們便不禁要問了：汗是一滴一滴地流在地上的，然而那兒才是這些勞作的報償，能用什麽來担保呢？</p>
<p>小市鎮上，過了端陽，到夏天的中心，正是農忙的時候，商店與茶樓，全是「清當」裏的時期。街上是清淡的，店家開了店門，祗是呆呆地望着空蕩蕩的街道，太陽照着，看來這永遠難以平坦的石子路上已有火一般的沸熱了。店夥兒閑着，三三兩兩地伏在櫃上打瞌睡，也有的就倚了半個身子，和街上的熟識的「光棍」們嚼蛆。茶樓是同樣冷清清地，除了幾個城裏的「老先生之外，已經少有人上鎮來買壺茶喝喝，或坐一回找人閒話。夏天是一個興奮的季節，太陽把大地晒沸之後，跟著也把整个的生物界都攪熱騰起來了。人，夾着其他的動物，在這最適宜於滋長的季候裏丢掉了一切而忙碌起來，讓鳥兒怎麼叫，讓風怎麼吹呢。流着勞怍的汗，把安樂放到將來去是必要的。這當兒，閑逸是不適宜的，疏懶是不適宜的；夏天，它需要人去勞作，去流汗，而不是躺在湘妃榻上使着人「沈李浮瓜」的啊。</p>
<h3 id="c205">蕭伯納主張黑白種通婚 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>黑人不是一般人多視為世界上的劣種麼？但是事有出人意料的，世界著名的英國文學家蕭伯納，近從南菲遊歷回國，竟主張菲州黑白種居民互相通婚。據他的意見，唯有這個方法，南菲白種人民才能解决他們生存所倚賴的重要問題。蕭氏並說明黑人絕不是劣種。蕭氏能化除種族畛域，打破階級觀念，固然值得欽佩。但是蕭氏為的，仍是南菲白種人的生存。白種繁殖以後，那裏還有黑種存留的餘地呢？蕭氏又說菲州歸根總屬於菲人，不屬於許多互相競爭的列强，這個見解，極是渺茫。土地旣為異種佔有，要想恢復，比登天還難哩。況且自種總是維護白種的，我們可看現在意阿的爭案。阿此亞尼西政府近致電美政府，申請援引凱洛格非戰公約，制止意國開戰。美國覆電，竟以空言搪塞，而最近又有法英比捷克瑞典丹麥六國禁止軍火運往阿國。倘若意阿戰事一旦發作，阿國的軍械，旣不能及意國的粳利，而又無後路的接濟，那是必敗無疑的。但是意圖用雷霆萬鈞之力，加於阿國，阿國終無屈服的表示，蕭氏說的黑人並非劣種，確有理由。具有這種精神的人民，終久不會滅亡在世界上的。</p>
<p>蕭氏這次從南菲回到倫敦數小時後，便對前往訪問的每日電聞訪員談起他所視為嚴重的一件事。他對於南菲，非常良好的風土，感受極大的印象。但是造成危險的，便是那可怕地日光。</p>
<p>「這個問題，他說道：「就是白人能否生存在這些地方，現在是漸漸嚴重了。我不是說，因為不服水土，你要死的，你是不會死的。這個問題，却是你的子孫能否在南菲生育。當我在南菲時，遇到一件頗可詫異的事，便是鐵路大巨畢羅懇求白人多多移居南菲，維持該處的白種人民。那是什麽意思呢？大衆看了美洲的白種，甚形富庶，便以為不難用白種把南菲播满，但是南菲是不會播滿的。這不是節育問題，因為南菲許多人很願有兒女，無奈不能使他們長大成人罷了。我以為這或者因為南菲日光太烈，不宜於白皮膚的人民。補救的方法，大約只有把皮膚變黑了。這就是說，南菲德白人，不妨娶黑女為妻。」</p>
<p>「你老這個理想，不是要惹白人憎惡麼」？訪員便問道：</p>
<p>「不錯」，蕭氏回答道：「但是現在世上夾種已不少了。我曾在夏威夷聰人說，南洋羣島的土著，現漸漸消滅了。純種的人，很少留存着。南菲兩色種混合起來，或可以把問題解決。須知這不是一個黑白問題，第一要知道，地球面上，本來沒有白種這回事。中國人稱我們為紅毛人，這是的對的。菲州的蘇魯人，確然是高尚的人類。從前有許多人設法想把他們降到低劣的地位，但是結果總遭失敗，因為他們並不是劣種呀。你們假使看見他們工作的狀態，一定願意英國工人也照他們一樣工作。」</p>
<p>蕭氏又以為這個問題並不限於南菲，還可以推及菲陸一大部分，</p>
<p>蕭氏接着說道：「本人常說把德國舊有的殖民地還給德國，而墨索里尼也正想把手伸到阿比西尼亞。你們現在雖可把菲州瓜分給歐洲的列强，但是將來棕油一天，菲人要對你們說道：『你們這些人，一個不許佔有菲州的土地』！到那時菲州的人，無論是土著，是白種，是黑種，或其他甚麼人，都將目覩菲洲歸根總屬於菲人，不屬於許多互相競爭的歐洲列强。血統是可以混合的，但是菲洲的土著却有他們特殊的能力，久而久之，吾人可見只有他們具着生存在菲洲的能力，旁的人都沒有的。</p>

<p>歌壇霸主卡爾勃烈蓀主演的「同心曲，」Two　Hearts　in　Wa　tz　Time是一個音樂的羅曼斯。它的故事。是描寫一位癡情的作曲家，去追求他的新作品中的一位女主角，女的雖然也很愛他，可是態度始終不卽不離，毫無表示，作曲家憤而出走。這時新劇公演日期已近，還有緊要歌譜沒有寫好，他都不管，弄得導演急的跳脚，那女主角爲了顧全大局起見，祗好追上前去，向他解釋一切，不料是時女的又把作曲家的妹子，當作他的情人，於是愛河中又起情波，但結果一切誤會，均幸消除，二人仍舊言歸於好。卡爾勃烈蓀，在這部作品裏，不但有幾支新歌像「同心曲」「維也納風光」「給牠一個輕吻」等，唱得非常動聽，而表演亦極神化，尤其是他的舞技，可稱佳妙絕倫，現聞該片不久將在國泰大戲院公映云。</p>

<p>三種美妙式樣適合一切需要</p>
<p>近兩年來。汽車界之驚人進步。可於一九三五年式蘭腦汽車覘之也。不論以飛機動力化原理之應用於車身及構造而言。或以引擎搆製之處處合乎經濟原則而言。殆皆以蘭腦爲最足稱。蘭腦於各方面所具有之種種進步。旣多至不勝枚舉。而其價格則無所增益。其內部之軒敞與舒適。亦且毫無所損。斯則尤爲難能可貴。誠不愧爲機械工程上之一大成功者。</p>
<p>蘭腦新車。計有三組。其漆飾之美妙。外觀之壯麗。蓋已哄動　滬。爲汽車界人士所一致艷羨之車輛。新車各種式樣齊全。不論辦公運動或家庭方面一切用途。胥極愉快勝任。新車外表。固極美妙動人。而其內容。却又精優卓絕。蘭腦素以效用宏偉著稱於世。而歷來蘭腦車主所以極端滿意。亦卽以此。今則無車對於此種優點。不僅保持之已也。且更能發揚光大之焉。</p>
<p>蘭腦各種式樣中。尤以維沃斯達拉運動式。最足引人入勝。其搆製係以飛機實地試騐爲根據。故確能合乎飛機動力化原理。其備儲動力。與美麗壯觀。以及逈不可及之速率。乃其特色中之首先予人以深刻印象者。至其內部地位。益臻寬暢。漆飾裝璜。彌極美妙。此項新車。計有活頂轎跑車。雙門轎車。及加大蓬車等三種式樣。篷車五人座位。舒適之至。此外維沃斯達拉家庭篷車。計有五座及七座兩種。前後座位寬敞。儘可隨意屈伸。七座式裝配六窗。一致裝用無風陣式通風。至另一種式樣。則爲具有運動式外觀之跑車。其動作效能。幾與大運動式相同。而其消耗則較經濟。凡欲於市區中行駛迅速者。此種車輛尤爲相宜。蓋其敏妙異常之加速率。以及極便操縱。特別適合於本埠方面之車輛交通情形也。其停車所佔地位。較尋當爲小。車身特別美麗壯觀。按此種新式蘭腦汽車。其顯著進步之一。厥爲自働始動機及新式化油機。新車淤任何天氣。所以均可立卽發動者。蓋卽有此種新設備也。蘭腦引擎採用特別懸置方法。故可保不致發生絲毫顚震。至於車輪。極便更換。毫不費力。備輪置於掩藏之處。位置恰得其宜。故對於全車流綫形態。絕無妨碍。再一般車主。如果兼爲他人着想。則對於蘭腦之又一設備。當必贊美不置。按此設備無他。蓋卽便後　車輛。可以見及車行方向之後面方向指示器也。</p>
<h3 id="c215">汽車掣動機和制動機種類及說明 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 振民</p>
<p>控制每一汽車的主要機件。就是掣動機和制動機。假使汽車上沒有掣動機的裝置。那麽汽車就沒有行駛的可能。假使汽車上沒有制動機的裝置。乃麽汽車就會不停地行駛。發生種種損害的結果。這二種機械。都是缺一不可的。近年來對於汽車工程製造的改進。有蒸蒸日上的趨勢。特別對於掣動和制動機的改良。使掣動和制動效率增加到百分之九十餘。所以現在新式的汽車。僅僅需要很小的力。就可以觸發引擎的行駛。或使行駛高速的引擎在數秒鐘內突然停止。這都是很顯明的例子。</p>
<p>掣動機和制動機的種類極多。尤其因爲近年來電學的昌明。新的機械在不斷地引進同時舊的掣動或制動機在不斷地淘汰。現在將最重要的幾種。　　如下。</p>
<p>甲　掣動機械</p>
<p>（一）熱管掣動機　這種掣動機的採用最早。牠是利用外界的熱—普通用煤氣媒—使汽缸內的壓縮空氣溫度增加至　燒點。最後爆炸在汽缸內發生。使活塞推動拐軸。再推動推進器。使車身前進。這種制度。發火雖然安穩。但是汽缸內爆炸時間沒有一定。這很最大的缺點。並且需要多量的燃燒氣體。以資發動。這足以增加燃料的價格。所以現在新式汽車內。很少採用這種掣動制。</p>
<p>（二）自然燃發掣動機這種掣動機。完全不用外界的熱以增加汽缸內汽體溫度。牠是完全利用氣體混合物的體積壓縮作用。以增加溫度至燃燒點。使汽缸內氣體爆發。以推動活塞。此種氣體混合物。僅限於某種中號油和空氣混合而成。對於揮發性很高的油類。如汽油等等。均不能採用。所以現在汽車上採用這種掣動機的。僅百分之一，二，而已</p>
<p>（三）電氣掣動機現在每百輛汽車中。有九十五輛是採用電氣掣動機。因爲這種掣動機的效率極髙。並且時間很速。在二三秒鐘內卽可推動車身。洵爲任何掣動機所不如。牠們的作用。都利用感應電的原理。加以適當的機械。牠們又可分爲下列兩種。甲，開關制（—Make-ander-Bak　System）—此制採用最廣。牠是利用第一和第二綫圈的威應作用。發生威應電流。其第一綫圈內裝有開關。利用歪輪和電磁作用。作這開關時接時離。於是綫圈內就發生感應電壓。使兩極的距離間發生火花。這種火花的發生。是在汽缸內部。所以使汽缸裏的汽油空氣混合物的溫度。增加到相當程度。發生爆炸。使活塞推動。車身前進。這種掣動的迅速和靈敏。實爲任何工程師所未預料的。乙，跳躍火屋制（Jump-Spark　System）—此制與前述者不同的地方。在電極的裝置。和電壓的髙低。（甲）法的電極。是可以移動的。電壓也很低。現在的制度適得其反。汽缸裏裝有固定的電極二個。相距很小空隙。和用歪輪的旋轉作用。使綫圈內感應電驟然增加。於是二極間就發生髙壓的火星。躍入空隙。使汽缸內氣體溫度驟然增加。體積隨之漲大。使活塞推進。車輪旋轉。此種制度。因電壓很高。常裝有電容器以防止過髙電壓。遏止短路的危險。（甲）和（乙）二法雖大致相似。然（甲）法較（乙）法簡單多多。且無短路等現象發生。故現在大多數新式汽車中。均採用（甲）法。我們旣已將掣動機詳加說明。現在再將制動機的大概種類。分折如下。</p>
<p>乙機制動機械</p>
<p>（一）機械動機機械制動最是節單。牠是利用槓桿作用。使「制動鞋」緊貼後輪。（制動鞋普通用橡皮或鋼製）。因摩阻力之作用。使後輪停北前進。此制最大利益。在簡單和修理便捷。不過鋼或鐵製制動鞋每易生銹。使制動力不平衡而失其效率。故新式車上採用很少</p>
<p>（二）水力制動機牠是利用水力傳佈作用以制動車輪。通常用二個相連的立式　筒。（截面積一大一小）。代替槓桿。筒內盛水或輕質油類。制動時僅須輕踏足板。卽能使銜接大筒的制動鞋緊貼車輪。使車身停止前進。此法所生的制動效率。十倍於第一法。不過最大的缺點。就是筒周很容易滲漏。非特效率消失。卽修理亦戚困難。採用較（一）法爲廣。</p>
<p>（三）空氣制動機　此種制動機的構造和水力制動機完全相似。十不過　筒內是用空氣。這樣可以避免滲漏的危險。空氣在未用制動前。先用馬達樓壓縮。藏在圓筒內。應用時可將氣門啟發。卽可髙壓的空氣衝入另一圓筒。使「制動鞋」緊貼車輪。車身停止前進。此種壓縮空氣。可以不斷地用小馬達輸送。不用制動機時。小馬達能自動停止。此法較前二法進步多多。故現在百分之六十的汽車。都用這個制動機。</p>
<p>（四）電磁制動機也同掣動機一樣。有利用綫圈的威應電以資制動的。其構造頗簡單。在引擎的主要轉動軸上。裝有固定的接合凖。隨軸轉動。另一接合凖。則用小軸緊接感應綫圈之中心。此種感應綫圈有蓄電池連接。制動時僅須將電路開啟。綫圈內卽有感應電發生。就產生磁性迫力。使合榫小軸推動。二接合榫卽自動嚙合。轉軸就停止行駛。此種制動機。雖不及空氣制動機的效率大。但因爲牠簡單的構造。現在採用頗廣。</p>
<p>總觀上述掣動和制動機的種類雖多。但漸漸的汽車上都採用電氣的作用。以得到效率極高的掣動和制動。是很明顯的。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Difficulties in Initiating the Yellow River Breach Closure; Provincial Relief Society Decides to First Distribute Emergency Relief; Han Fuqu to Inspect the Breach Site; According to Engineers, Diversion into the Huai River is Unlikely <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Jinan) Han Fuqu is scheduled to travel by car to inspect the breach site early on the 17th. On the morning of the 14th, the water level of the Yellow River in Shaanxi Prefecture was 294.02, with a flow rate of 3400. Currently, each breach has widened by 1.3 Chinese inches, with a water level of 28.91 meters, about 100 li east-west and 60 li north-south from the disaster area. The water depth ranges from six or seven feet to ten feet, inundating over 500 villages and affecting more than 200,000 people. Heze has seen over 300 villages submerged. The Provincial Relief Society is holding a meeting today, resolving to first send personnel with 50,000 yuan to the disaster area for emergency relief. The Economic Committee has telegraphed Han, instructing him to first allocate 40,000 yuan from the Yellow River and Grand Canal joint transportation project funds and 20,000 yuan from the Yellow River levee project funds to address the immediate needs. The Jiangsu Construction Bureau has dispatched technician Zhao Yusu, and the Huai River Guidance Association has sent engineer Zhou Yushan to Jinan, scheduled to travel to Linpu on the 17th to inspect the breach and the Jiangsu dam. This is because the dam can divert the main current northward, preventing it from diverting into the Huai River and endangering northern Jiangsu. Zhao mentioned that the Huai River guidance project is just beginning and has already cost millions of yuan. If Yellow River water diverts into the Huai River, all efforts will be washed away by the flood. Furthermore, according to engineers, diversion into the Huai River is unlikely, but initiating the breach closure is quite difficult because the area near the breach is all water, with no soil available for extraction. Disaster victims are gathered on the levee, and there is nowhere to store materials. The flood season is currently underway, and engineering personnel everywhere are engaged in rescue efforts, with insufficient manpower. Moreover, the water source is abundant, so any closure attempt would be immediately washed away, wasting effort. It is only possible to proceed after the water recedes. The Jiangsu dam is still intact but ineffective due to being submerged. Once the water recedes slightly, it can divert the current northward, at which point the breach can be silted up, making the closure easier. After the breached water enters the Shu River, the people of Yejia and Jiaxiang counties are likely to engage in armed conflict due to conflicting interests in protecting and breaching the levee. The Executive Yuan has ordered afforestation of the levees along the Yellow River in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, with Shangqiu and Cao County in Shandong and Henan using the old Yellow River center as the boundary and creating boundary forests. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) The Provincial Government received a telegram from Kong Xiangrong, stating that the Yellow River breach in Shandong Province has been ordered to be closed as conditions allow, while making every effort to protect the Jiangsu dam to prevent the entire river from shifting south. Furthermore, Qin Fen telegraphed a reply, stating that 60,000 yuan has been allocated for Yellow River flood prevention expenses. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) The Shanghai, Hankou, Anhui, and Jinan Red Cross societies have telegraphed the local branch, urging them to quickly raise funds to rescue the disaster victims. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) A telephone call from Baoding reports that the Hebei River Affairs Bureau Director telegraphed the province stating that the river water level has risen sharply, with a total increase of 1.34 meters on the 15th and 16th, and is still rising rapidly. The water level is the highest ever recorded. Various sections are simultaneously sending urgent reports. Since mid-June, project funds have been insufficient, making progress difficult. Flood control funds have not yet been allocated, so it is earnestly requested that funds be allocated quickly to actively carry out protection measures. A telephone call from Baoding reports that the Hebei Construction Department telegraphed a reply to the River Affairs Bureau Director stating that 50,000 yuan for flood control expenses has been urged to be allocated by the Finance Department. It is hoped that officials and laborers will be strictly supervised to effectively protect the area and not be negligent. Furthermore, a telegram was sent to the magistrates of Dongchang, Puyang, and San counties, stating that the upper reaches of the Yellow River are concerning, and they should quickly gather a large number of laborers to cooperate in intensifying protection efforts. Another telegram was sent to Ouyang, a technician at the River Affairs Bureau, instructing him to quickly set up defenses and actively guard the area, without being negligent. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Qi Shou'an, Director of the Hebei River Affairs Bureau, telegraphed the province stating that the river water level rose sharply by 2.8 Chinese inches on the morning of the 15th and is expected to continue rising.

<p>(Tianjin) A telephone call from Baoding reports that Zhang Qinglu, the magistrate of Changyuan County, telegraphed the Hebei Provincial Government on the 14th, stating that the Shaanxi water arrived suddenly, and the Yellow River water level in Hebei territory rose sharply, with extremely turbulent flow. On the 14th, the banks of the Changyuan levee overflowed suddenly, with water depths of six to seven feet on flat ground. Many civilian houses and fields collapsed, and countless livestock were drowned. The crops were washed away, a tragic sight. The water is currently overflowing, and over 320 villages have been flooded, affecting over 120,000 people. Local gentry are currently cooperating and heading out by boat to rescue people, while also investigating the actual disaster situation to facilitate relief efforts. Changyuan has suffered disasters for consecutive years, and this time it has been hit by a major calamity again. It is requested that a large sum of money be allocated quickly to provide relief. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A telephone call from Baoding reports that Qi Shou'an, Director of the Hebei Yellow River Affairs Bureau, telegraphed the province, stating that according to reports from Shaanxi Province in the upper reaches, the Shaanxi Yellow River water rose again by 3.2 meters on the 15th, with the water level 1.34 meters higher than the same time last year, and is still rising continuously, making the situation tight and protection extremely difficult.

<p>(Hankou) The Qichun Fucheng Dike collapsed on the 16th. Thirty-seven dikes in Public Security and over twenty dikes in Shishou have all collapsed. Of the over two hundred dikes in Xiaogan, only the Huangsi Dike remains. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Although the Jianghan water level has receded slightly, the dikes in Wuhan are still not out of danger, and the counties upstream of Jiang and Xiang are almost entirely submerged, with a severe disaster situation. Director Zhang of the General Headquarters believes that everyone has a responsibility for rescue and disaster relief, but party members should especially make every effort to lead the way for people from all walks of life. Therefore, at 10:30 AM on the 16th, Wuhan Provincial Party Department's twenty committee members were convened at the General Headquarters for a discussion meeting. He Chengjun, Gan Naiguang, Wang Shaoyu, Yu Yuzhi, Ai Yuying, Shan Chengyi, Wu Shaoshu, and Jiang Shuzhi attended. A general mobilization was decided, with all party members in the three towns of Wuhan and various other counties forming teams to participate in the rescue work on the dikes in Wuhan and to distribute medicines and food to the disaster-stricken counties. In terms of fundraising, in addition to Zhang's donation of 3,000 yuan, it is planned to solicit donations from central committee members residing in Wuhan and various party members. It is hoped that the results will be significant. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Hankou on the 16th was sunny with a slight breeze, and the weather was extremely hot. The river water receded slightly. According to the Jianghan Customs water level report, the water level in Hankou on the 16th was 51 feet 1.5 inches, a decrease of 1.5 inches compared to the 15th. Chongqing was at three feet, Yichang at 23 feet 4 inches, Shashi at 21 feet, Yuezhou at 49 feet 5 inches, and Changsha at 24 feet 2 inches. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) (Sent at 2:45 PM) An official of the local garrison headquarters was executed by firing squad this morning for failing to protect the dike effectively. According to the Public Security Bureau, the number of deaths from the flood here has reached twenty-three. (16th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Today, Zhang Xueliang narrowly escaped disaster while flying to a village near Sichuan Province to distribute relief supplies. According to Zhang's statement to a Reuters reporter, when the plane dropped 1,400 pounds of food to the village, bandits opened fire on the plane, hitting the wing. Fortunately, there was no other damage. Government bombers are also dropping food in the disaster area. (16th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Although the river water receded slightly this morning, the authorities are still working tirelessly on disaster prevention. As it stands, the overall situation is not too difficult to handle. Hankou has spent 370,000 yuan on disaster prevention expenses and is said to be telegraphing Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to request an allocation of 200,000 yuan for use. (16th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Yesterday, water surged from the ditches in the former Russian concession, flooding a section of the riverbank. However, the accumulated water was pumped out. All is back to normal in Yichang, Shashi, and other ports, except for the overcrowding of disaster victims. However, the surrounding areas are still underwater, and many rural areas have been destroyed, with significant loss of life. Yesterday, there were even more floating corpses in the Han River than before. Air traffic between Ping and Yue is currently only operating between Peiping and Zhengzhou due to water obstruction. (16th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Shashi The river water is only a few inches below the city wall. If the water rises again, tens of thousands of people in Shashi will suffer a major disaster. Outside the city, the riverbank is several feet deep, and many houses in low-lying areas have been submerged. However, foreign property has not suffered significant damage. About 4,000 disaster victims from the surrounding villages have taken refuge in the city, and many more plan to reside in the city, but are currently obstructed by the water. The countryside around Shashi is desolate, with some houses completely destroyed and others half-destroyed. All crops have been lost. (16th Reuters News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The water level in Hankou this morning was 51.15 feet, showing a slight decrease. Residents are greatly relieved by the slight decrease in water level, but disaster prevention personnel say that it is not yet time to be optimistic, because it is not easy to say whether the Zhanggong Dike, on which Hankou relies for safety, can withstand the pressure of the river water for long.

<p>(Nanjing) The Economic Committee reports that the news of Yang Silian, Director of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, leaving Hankou is false. The committee has received many telegrams from Yang today, reporting on the flood control work. However, one telegram stated that he has been suffering from dizziness due to prolonged flood control efforts and several sleepless nights and has been hospitalized for treatment. All flood control projects and the issuance of funds and materials are still being carried out as usual. The committee has telegraphed him, urging him to overcome his illness and work diligently for the public during this critical time of flood control. Furthermore, it is reported that Yang telegraphed the committee today, stating that the Xida and Dongda dikes were reported to have overflowed and collapsed, and it was also heard that the Luohengchen Dike had also collapsed. However, no reports have been received yet, and he has ordered the construction of each breach to be rushed to prevent further expansion. The Economic Committee issued 200,000 yuan for flood control expenses to the Jianghan Bureau in Hankou on the 16th, bringing the total issued to 500,000 yuan. An additional 100,000 yuan in flood control subsidies was issued to Hubei Province, bringing the total issued to 200,000 yuan. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e24">Lin, Minister of War, Forces Mazaki to Resign; Japan Unifies Military Power; Watanabe Succeeds as Inspector General of Military Education, Paying Particular Attention to the Kwantung Army <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Inspector General of Military Education is one of the key positions in the Japanese Imperial Army General Staff. Minister of War Lin, in order to unify the management power of the Japanese Army, wanted the incumbent Inspector General Mazaki to resign. Mazaki refused, so the military department issued a clear order to dismiss him. This is Minister of War Lin's first step in rectifying military power, and he is paying particular attention to the Kwantung Army, because since the September 18th Incident, due to the activities of the youth faction, military power has gradually become disunified. The Emperor summoned Minister of War Lin and approved his promotion and demotion of several thousand military officers in order to consolidate the unification of military power. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of War Lin, in order to control the internal affairs of the army, requested the resignation of Inspector General of Military Education General Mazaki. Chief of the General Staff Prince Kan'in also supported the Minister of War's opinion, so Mazaki was dismissed from his post. The Minister of War recommended General Watanabe Jotaro to succeed to the position. (Domei dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) One of the three top officials of the army, Inspector General Mazaki, has resigned. It is said that General Mazaki and Minister of War Lin had different opinions on various important issues. During the discussion of the army personnel transfer issue in August at the meeting of the three top officials, their opinions clashed head-on, so Mazaki was forced to resign. Minister of War Lin intends to discuss the army personnel transfer issue with the new Inspector General Watanabe, and implement the army control plan that has never been realized before. However, the relationship between the Minister of War and Mazaki cannot be expected to be satisfactory. The Mazaki faction's opposition to Minister of War Lin's attitude will surely take concrete form. Because his real brother, Shirakami Yukichi, was involved in a bribery incident, Minister of War Lin is in a very difficult position, and his advancement or retreat is attracting attention from all sides. (Domei dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of War Lin's replacement of one of the three top officials this time to implement his ambitions has won praise from both inside and outside the army. This decisive action is unprecedented in the army. The new Inspector General Watanabe is regarded by all factions and cliques as being in a detached and fair position. Future personnel changes in the army will be carried out smoothly, based on the principle of using talent appropriately. It is also expected that the control within the military will be strengthened as a result. It is said that the Minister of War will deal with those in the military who act without authorization with great severity. However, there should be no impact on the control of the army's leadership in the future. All military councilors will cooperate to ensure internal control, so the army's personnel administration will be brought back on track by this change. (Domei dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) In the army personnel transfer issue, the advancement and retreat of Inspector General of Military Education General Mazaki has attracted public attention. At the meeting of the three top officials on the 12th, Minister of War Lin directly requested Mazaki's resignation, and sought the consent of Chief of the General Staff Prince Kan'in. On the 16th, the following formal order was issued: General Mazaki Jinzaburo, Inspector General of Military Education and Military Councilor, is relieved of his post. General Watanabe Jotaro is appointed as Inspector General of Military Education and Military Councilor. This order is because Inspector General Mazaki and Minister of War Lin had conflicting opinions on the issue of strengthening army control. Because he could not carry out his duties, the Minister of War requested Mazaki's resignation. (Domei dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3 id="e26">General Watanabe is Skilled in Strategy <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) General Watanabe is from Aichi Prefecture, and is a master of fortification. He has a gentle personality, respects seniority, and is non-partisan. He is a pure soldier. The army regards him as an English-style gentleman, with excellent tactics and strategy. He enjoys the respect of young officers. (Dentsu dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The new Inspector General of Military Education, General Watanabe, is gentle and sincere, a perfect gentleman, values seniority, and is very studious. He buys and reads almost all the latest books published in various countries. He is famous in the army. He is the first to read new publications in Japan. Whenever someone introduces a new foreign book, he has already read it. He often spends his spare time reading, and he reads very quickly. Observers are amazed by his speed and admire him. However, the General is very unskilled in horsemanship. He once fell off his horse during an army review, which he found quite embarrassing. Recently, he has been practicing riding every day at the riding ground near his residence, and has made some progress. The General is very particular about etiquette. His personality is most suitable for serving as Inspector General of Military Education, so the army celebrates that they have found the right person and he has won general praise. His family includes his wife, Suzuko, and two sons and two daughters. (Domei dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The new Inspector General of Military Education, Watanabe Jotaro, is from Aichi Prefecture, born in April of the 7th year of the Meiji era (1874), and is 62 years old this year. He is a graduate of the 5th class of the Military Academy. He, Military Councilor General Hishikari, and Kwantung Army Commander General Minami are powerful figures in the army. He has served as a military attaché in Germany, a staff member of the General Staff, a military attaché in the Netherlands, a section chief of the General Staff, commander of the 29th Infantry Brigade, president of the Army University, and commander of the 7th Division. In the 4th year of Showa (1929), he was appointed as the Director of the Aviation Department, and in the 5th year, he was appointed as the Commander of the Taiwan Army. In the 6th year, he was promoted to General of the Army and Military Councilor, and reappointed as Director of the Aviation Department, striving to enrich the Japanese Army's aviation department. He resigned as Director of the Aviation Department in the 8th year of Showa (1933) until today. (Domei dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan requested the Judicial Yuan to interpret seven points of ambiguity regarding the procedures for disciplining public officials for unclear handover of duties: (1) If a person continues to work in an agency affiliated with the ministry after handing over duties, and should be subject to a suspension of employment, should the Ministry of Personnel be notified for registration in addition to the usual dismissal procedures? (2) If a person has been reassigned to another location after handing over duties in an agency affiliated with the ministry, and should be subject to a suspension of employment, should the ministry directly notify the person's immediate superior agency or主管長官 to suspend employment, and should the Ministry of Personnel be notified for registration at the same time? (3) If a person ignores the deadline for recovering funds, can Article 10 be applied to confiscate their property for compensation? (4) What laws and regulations should be used for the "punishment according to law" mentioned in Article 10 and Article 12, Paragraph 2? (5) Does "jointly bear the responsibility for compensation" mean joint and several liability? (6) Do punishments such as suspension of employment, demerit, salary reduction, or dismissal need to go through disciplinary proceedings? (7) How should a person who delays reporting after leaving office be dealt with? The Judicial Yuan explained: (1) and (2) Article 9 of the Public Official Handover Regulations is punitive in nature and should be submitted for disciplinary action in accordance with the procedures for disciplining public officials. (3) If strict pursuit is ineffective, because there is no provision for confiscating property, the National Government can only file a lawsuit to compel execution. (4) Transfer the case separately to the disciplinary authority or the court for handling according to law. (5) Should jointly bear joint and several liability. (6) and (7) Except for demerits of public officials below the recommended rank, which can be imposed directly by the主管長官 in accordance with Article 12 of the Disciplinary Law, all others must be submitted for disciplinary action in accordance with disciplinary procedures.

<p>Telegram from Jinan (Title Omitted): The situation of the breach of the Juancheng River has been reported to the Central Government in previous telegrams. The severity of this Yellow River flood is unprecedented. The water in the Shaanxi and Luoyang areas rose sharply, and the water from the upper reaches came down in layers, waves, and raging roars, pouring into Shandong Province. Although soldiers, workers, and civilians desperately tried to protect it, human power could not turn the tide, and the Li Sheng Tun 民埝 in Juancheng County and the levee between Dongzhuang and Linpuji were overflowed and collapsed, with a total of six breaches, more than 200 zhang wide. The overflowing water was divided into two streams, passing through the Yincheng 引馬集 Juancheng Huang'an area, one heading towards Heze 北　, and turning northeast at the Qili River, rejoining into one, rushing straight and flooding without returning. Coupled with continuous heavy rain, the water situation is becoming more and more serious. The Jiangsu Dam has now been completely submerged. Although various places have built surfaces to control the water, the water is too fierce and fails step by step. Wherever the water reaches, Juancheng 鄣城 Heze 鉅野 are the most severely affected, with water everywhere. Other counties such as Wenshang, Jiaxiang, Jining, Dongping, Yanggu, and Shouzhang also have extremely heavy disasters. I have now received a telegram from Chairman Li Yizhi on the 13th, stating that 60-70% of the water has flowed out of the mouth, and the entire river is pouring down, which is extremely critical. According to a report from Regional Inspector Wang Shaochang, the water between 鄲城鉅野 is more than 70 li wide. According to the current situation, the disaster area has grown to more than 200 li long and 70-80 li wide. Fields, gardens, houses, and graves have all become swamps. 　Grain　shoes have been given to the water gods. As for the situation of the people in the disaster area, those who have escaped to the堤 are eating in the wind and sleeping in the open, with no way to make a living. Those who are still trapped in the water are calling to the heavens and earth, and are waiting to die. The cries of sorrow are everywhere, and it is unbearable to hear. It is difficult to predict the extent of the disaster. The number of villages and the number of disaster-stricken people in the disaster area also need to be investigated. In short, this flood is several times more serious than the breach in Dongming the year before last. Since the people of more than a dozen counties in western Shandong suffered from the Dongming flood, their vitality has been depleted, and their wounds have not yet healed. This spring, the drought was rampant, and the two wheats failed. A few days ago, the rain had just been sufficient, and we were hoping for a good autumn harvest, but an extraordinary event occurred, and we were again in a predicament. Alas, my people, how can they bear this? As 榘, I have failed in my duty, and I cannot prevent it in advance, nor can I save it afterwards. I am guilty before the gods and ashamed before public opinion. I am bewildered at midnight and cannot sleep or eat. For the present plan, in addition to sending personnel with disaster relief funds to various counties for verification and distribution, it is not enough to save the dying people without providing extensive relief. Without quickly筹堵决, it is not enough to reverse the bad luck in the future. However, the disaster is so serious, and the project is so huge. It is difficult to consider both. In this time of extreme scarcity of funds, even if we dig and scrape everything, it will be a drop in the bucket, and it will not help. After thinking again and again, I have to cry out loudly and ask for life for the people. I only hope that Hong Bao will量与之,推 Hunger drowning with the怀, 特沛恩施,优予倾助, to 淡沈 the disaster and卹 the people's lives. Shandong is very fortunate, the overall situation is very fortunate. Exhausted, I beg for your consideration. Shandong Provincial Government Chairman Han Fuqu叩删 (15th) You secret,</p>

<h3 id="e57">Epidemic Prevention Movement <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— Year</p>
<p>For a week, the temperature has increased quite sharply. According to the report from the Xujiahui Observatory, the highest temperature in Shanghai was only 91 degrees on the 9th. On the 10th, it suddenly rose to 95.5 degrees. On the 13th, at the beginning of the hottest period, it reached 97 degrees. On the 14th, it exceeded 100 degrees. In the past two days, it has also been around 100 degrees. Related news appearing in this newspaper includes a sharp increase in the number of patients with seasonal diseases in various hospitals and the intensified implementation of the epidemic prevention movement in this city. The meaning of "prevention" is to think of potential problems and prepare for them in advance. Now, while seasonal diseases have not yet become a serious problem, taking early measures to prevent them is indeed a wise move by the health authorities of this city and should be emulated nationwide.</p>
<p>Among the nine legally defined infectious diseases in our country, cholera is most commonly discovered during the hottest period and is extremely virulent. Therefore, it is acceptable to say that the focus of summer epidemic prevention work is preventing the occurrence of cholera. This disease was rampant throughout China in 1932. According to statistics from over 300 cities surveyed, there were 100,000 patients, and the death toll exceeded 30,000. In that year, Shanghai, due to its residents' living conditions being conducive to the spread of the disease, had over 4,000 infected people citywide. However, only 317 people died, with a mortality rate of only 7.4% (detailed in the 1934 Shen Bao Yearbook). This indicates that Shanghai's efforts in epidemic prevention were more intensive than those of other cities. In the past two years, very few cases of this disease have been discovered, partly due to the effectiveness of large-scale preventive vaccinations and partly due to the disease's tendency to have a major outbreak every three or four years (detailed in Table 15 of Dr. Gao Jinglang's book on infectious diseases in children).</p>
<p>The easiest way to start epidemic prevention work is to popularize preventive vaccinations. According to Mr. Jin Baoshan of the Health Facilities Experimental Center, who compiled the "1934 Epidemic Prevention Facilities Situation" for this newspaper's yearbook, over 749,000 people in Shanghai had received preventive vaccinations by the end of August. Although this may not be the sole reason for the low incidence of epidemic diseases this year, its effectiveness can be generally seen. This year, as previously reported in this newspaper, only 265,000 people in Shanghai have been vaccinated, only one-third of last year's number. This is a fact that the Shanghai health authorities should pay attention to in the epidemic prevention movement. Furthermore, the 3.5 million people living in areas prone to epidemic diseases should not be negligent and complacent simply because there have been no epidemics for two years. As for those in charge of epidemic prevention in other regions, we especially hope that they will pay attention to popularizing preventive vaccinations.</p>
<p>The means of transmitting infectious diseases include unclean drinking water, food, flies, and carriers. Of these, drinking water requires the most attention. Regarding the other factors, anyone with basic hygiene knowledge can often prevent transmission through personal efforts. However, even in places like London and Hamburg, where public health services are well-developed, unclean drinking water can still cause harm. In the Suzhou Creek in Shanghai, bacteriophages that resist cholera were discovered during the major epidemic of 1932. We hope that the local health authorities will conduct research on this. In inland areas, people lack hygiene knowledge, and polluted waterways cause significant harm. Local administrative and self-governance personnel must carry out disinfection work as soon as possible. Shanghai undertook this work in 1934. How effective it was and what lessons were learned should be publicized to serve as a model for the entire country.</p>
<p>This reporter has not personally witnessed epidemic prevention efforts, so my comments may be criticized as unwarranted concern. However, being prepared leads to success, while being unprepared leads to failure. If we only start discussing disaster prevention after seeing the water level rise, we will expend more effort and achieve less. The lessons of the past are not far off. The people of our country should take them to heart.</p>

<p>(Rome) Today, the Propaganda Department issued a communique announcing new measures taken by Italy in its army and navy. It is generally believed that the purpose of this communique is to inform all countries that Italy's military preparations are proceeding openly and will not be affected by any foreign interference. According to the communique, two more army divisions were mobilized today, and all mobilization plans have been fully implemented. There are now over 1,000 military aircraft available for attack. A total of ten divisions have been mobilized, including five regular army infantry divisions, each with 13,000 men: (1) the "Gaverglia" Division, (2) the "Bellolida" Division, (3) the "Sapodda" Division, (4) the "Gransano" Division, and (5) the "Silah" Division. There are also five Party militia divisions, each with 10,000 men: (1) the "March 23rd" Division, (2) the "April 21st" Division, (3) the "October 28th" Division, (4) the "January 3rd" Division, and (5) the "February 1st" Division. These names represent the most important dates in the history of the Fascist Party. In addition, there are approximately 35,000 troops permanently stationed in Italian East Africa, including over 14,000 in Tripolitania and Cyrenaica, 3,500 in Eritrea, and 3,200 in Somalia. There are also 35,000 specialized workers and technicians who have been sent to East Africa to build and repair roads. Once the project is completed, Prime Minister Mussolini will personally inspect it. In total, Italy has 185,000 troops in East Africa, including specialized workers. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Today's government gazette states that Italy, in view of Abyssinia's urgent preparations for war, must also take further military action. After Mussolini ordered the mobilization of two new divisions yesterday, the Italian expeditionary force to Ethiopia will reach 160,000 men. In addition, there are many soldiers in Italian Somalia. Today, Mussolini also requisitioned automobile drivers from the classes of 1909, 1910, and 1912, as well as dispatched additional combat aircraft and personnel to Ethiopia. At the same time, he ordered munitions factories to accelerate production. Mussolini himself is anxiously coordinating everything day and night in the Palazzo Venezia. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(Rome) It is expected that Mussolini will fly to Italian Eritrea in East Africa within the next few days to inspect the troops assembled there and deliver a speech encouraging the soldiers before the war against Ethiopia. Well-informed sources here deny that Italy has made any suggestions for resolving the dispute. The new military plan announced by the Italian Prime Minister yesterday was prominently featured on the front pages of all newspapers, with an even more determined attitude than before. The "Lavoro Fascista" newspaper stated that while European foreign ministries are endlessly discussing the legal interpretations of the so-called Abyssinian question and possible political adjustments, Prime Minister Mussolini is working hard. The Prime Minister, now the mastermind of political strategy, has stated that this is the only way to safeguard Italy's rights and glorify its future. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Rome) This year's Italian army summer exercises are scheduled for the end of August. They are of great importance and scale. More than seven divisions of troops with full combat readiness will participate in the exercises in the Bolsano area. Three divisions each will participate in Milan and Naples, and four divisions will participate in exercises near Udine. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The government has decided to hold large-scale army exercises in Italy within days. In terms of the number of participants, the scale of these exercises is unprecedented. The entire force will be divided into five groups to perform separately: one group in the Bolsano area, with seven army divisions; one group in the Udine area, with four army divisions; one group in the Milan area, with three army divisions; and one group in the Naples and Bari areas, with three army divisions. All will participate in the large-scale exercises simultaneously. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e59">Italy's New Naval Strength <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) The government has recently announced, in accordance with the decision of the Naval General Staff, that it will begin construction of ten new submarines, which are expected to be launched by the end of this year. It is generally believed that this decision is a direct response to the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and is intended to increase the safety of transporting troops and supplies to East Africa via the Suez Canal. As of September of last year, Italy's navy had a total tonnage of 370,589 tons. Its current strength is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Six battleships (two of which, each of 35,000 tons, were started in June of last year and are not yet completed; the remaining four each weigh 22,000 tons)</p>
<p>(2) One aircraft carrier</p>
<p>(3) Thirty cruisers (six of which are currently in dry dock for repairs)</p>
<p>(4) One hundred and eleven destroyers (twelve of which have not yet been launched)</p>
<p>(5) Seventy-seven submarines (totaling 55,524 tons; the ten to be built this month are not included) (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e60">The Current Status of Diplomatic Negotiations <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Hoare stated in the House of Commons today that if a reconciliation in the Italo-Ethiopian dispute is not reached by August 25, the League of Nations Council will convene a meeting on that day. From this, it can be seen that the League of Nations has apparently abandoned its decision to meet on July 25. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) The House of Commons will begin discussing the Italo-Ethiopian dispute next Tuesday. Lord Davies, the London District representative of the League of Nations Union, has submitted a motion in the House of Lords requesting immediate action, based on the Pact of Paris and the League of Nations Covenant, to resolve the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) Current diplomatic efforts to mediate the Italo-Ethiopian dispute are aimed at preventing the League of Nations Council from meeting on July 25. It has therefore been suggested that the Italo-Ethiopian Mediation Committee, based on the League of Nations resolution of May 25, select a new member before July 25. It is unanimously acknowledged that the Mediation Committee cannot be expected to achieve anything during this period, but it is believed that extending the committee's life will allow the League of Nations to pass through another month, providing ample time for continued negotiations. This is the only way to reconcile the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) It is reported that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has rejected the idea of convening a tripartite conference of Britain, France, and Italy, using the 1906 tripartite treaty to discuss the Ethiopian question, believing that it would not achieve a resolution. Britain proposed a new suggestion at the end of last week, proposing that the British and French ambassadors in Rome consult with representatives of the Italian government to study the Ethiopian issue in light of the 1906 treaty, especially to jointly discuss the legal viewpoints and substantive events on which Italy based its actions towards Ethiopia in Geneva. Regarding this, well-informed sources point out that Italy has several grievances against Ethiopia, which it has never raised with the League of Nations, most notably Ethiopia's persistence in the slave system and obstruction of normal commercial relations between Ethiopia and Italian territories. Therefore, it is not an exaggeration to say that Ethiopia has not fulfilled its obligations under the League of Nations Covenant. At present, Italy has not yet responded to Britain's new proposal. As far as is generally known, the goal of the negotiations currently being held between the countries concerned is not so much to seek a peaceful resolution to the dispute as it is to find a way to explain Italy's reasons for attacking Ethiopia, which is more in line with the truth. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>African Djibouti: Yesterday, people in this French territory celebrated Democracy Memorial Day with Italian sailors, expressing French sympathy for Italy's position on Ethiopia. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Mail reports today that the British government has asked Mussolini to detail his grievances against Ethiopia for consideration at the next meeting of the League of Nations Council. The newspaper also said that if Mussolini agrees, the British government may support the issue of Italian trusteeship over Ethiopia, and may even argue that placing Ethiopia under Italian rule would be beneficial to Ethiopia. However, the key seems to be whether Italy's rule over its African territories has been successful. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Opposition to the League of Nations mediating the Italo-Ethiopian dispute is growing, as can be seen in today's editorial in the Gazzetta del Popolo. The newspaper claims that since the failure of the Italo-Ethiopian arbitration committee, the League of Nations' mediation efforts have proven to be completely ineffective. Therefore, the best solution is to officially end this effort. Allowing Ethiopia to be a member of the League of Nations was a major mistake that should be corrected. It should no longer be regarded as a member of the League of Nations, allowing it to test the League's credibility. This would be too much of a distortion of the facts, which Italy cannot tolerate. The article concludes that Italy is not only a large and visible member of the League of Nations, but also essential to maintaining the League's life. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>

Authorities warned Davis that this recruitment violates international law, but he is still proceeding, asking recruits to travel to Ethiopia for public works projects. Davis has telegraphed the Ethiopian Emperor, stating that he intends to train an army of thousands. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>Miami, USA: The Black Fire has organized the Abyssinian Association to promote peace between Italy and Ethiopia. However, if peace fails, the association will train volunteers to serve in hospitals and ambulance services in Africa. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(New York) People sympathetic to Ethiopia here have recently formed the Committee on the Ethiopian Question, chaired by Mr. Wickersham, the chairman of the Foreign Policy Association and a renowned expert on international law, along with prominent figures from various churches. The committee plans to petition President Roosevelt, asking the U.S. government to notify Italy that if it goes to war with Ethiopia, it will not be supported by American public opinion. The U.S. is prepared to mediate the Italo-Ethiopian dispute in the spirit of international justice. The committee has printed 500,000 copies of this petition for wide distribution, hoping that the result will be one million signatures. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3 id="e63">Another Anti-Semitic Movement Erupts in Germany <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) Today, a film that excludes Jews was shown at the Western Cinema. Jewish viewers hissed and left their seats, causing a riot. A police patrol rushed to suppress it. Many evening newspapers criticized the Jews, with one newspaper saying that such actions were incomprehensible in the third year of the National Socialist government. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Another widespread nationwide anti-Semitic movement has recently erupted in Germany. It started last night when several National Socialist stormtroopers clashed with Jews on the street. Suddenly, the usually opulent Kurfürstendamm became chaotic, as the National Socialists considered the street to be the center of Jewish life. At that time, National Socialists smashed the windows of Jewish-owned shops. Although the police intervened, they were unable to stop the stormtroopers' actions. At the same time, anti-Semitic incidents were occurring in other cities. In Pleitenberg, Westphalia, a butcher named Lehoff requested that municipal authorities ban anti-Semitic movements. The National Socialists were furious and immediately launched a large-scale demonstration against him. In Rastenberg, a cattle dealer named Dantowitz was reportedly ordered by his fellow stormtroopers to salute, thus offending the dignity of the stormtroopers. The cattle dealer was dragged out and paraded through the city with a wooden sign that read, "This Jewish brat actually dared to ask the stormtroopers to salute him." In Presslau, six Jewish men and six Aryan women were arrested by the police for allegedly having relations. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Since the incident on Kurfürstendamm last night, anti-Semitic movements have erupted everywhere. Although the police have intervened in many ways, they have been unable to stop them due to the widespread occurrence of incidents. The Polistor Café has been completely destroyed. Hundreds of National Socialists stormed into a cinema because a film about the anti-Semitic movement currently showing was criticized by Jews. They searched the cinema for Jews. Pedestrians and drivers were stopped and inspected by National Socialists to determine whether they were Jews or Aryans. The outbreak of this anti-Semitic movement seems to have been incited by the rhetoric of the National Socialist press. Recently, newspapers have been attacking Jews more fiercely than before. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) This German anti-Semitic movement seems to be a planned affair. The National Socialist Party organ, Der Angriff, published an article a few days ago criticizing [illegible], demanding that National Socialists protest against it. Before the incident on Kurfürstendamm the night before, National Socialists had already held demonstrations in other places. After a period of calm yesterday, disturbances broke out again in the evening. The police fired into the air and patrolled dangerous areas in armored vehicles to prevent incidents. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The government has recently established a special school to teach air defense knowledge, which is directly under the Air Ministry. The school is responsible for developing and coordinating various air defense methods, as well as training personnel to maintain safety in the event of an enemy air raid. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>Will Issue 23 Substitute Laws</p>
<p>(Paris) The French cabinet is preparing to publish new orders and laws tonight to reduce the budget deficit and is therefore holding an unprecedentedly long cabinet meeting. It began at 9:30 AM this morning and lasted until 1:05 PM. The cabinet members then lunched with Prime Minister Laval and reconvened at 2:15 PM. At 6:00 PM, they went to the presidential palace, with President Lebrun presiding, to continue the meeting. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Paris) In order to implement the Financial Powers Act, the Cabinet issued the first substitute law order regarding government austerity on the 3rd of this month, containing three key points: (1) government officials cannot receive multiple salaries for multiple positions; (2) saving administrative expenses of the national defense agencies; (3) establishing a special committee to recommend possible austerity policies. At that time, it was reported that there were still several important measures that would be announced after the National Day on July 14. It is now known that after the State Council meeting adjourns at 6:00 PM tonight, the government will issue 23 substitute law orders, 15 of which relate to saving expenditures to ensure budget balance, and 8 relate to reducing the cost of living and economic recovery. The former 15 substitute law orders are further divided into three categories: (1) stopping waste, (2) reducing extravagance, and (3) substantial government austerity. In addition, there are various special measures to equalize the burden on all levels of the people. Le Matin reported that "the government is striving to reduce expenses on a wide scale, which will save the national treasury 100 million francs." L'Intransigeant reported, "According to Finance Minister Régnier's austerity plan, the salaries of all civil servants, employees, and railway workers, as well as the pensions of war veterans, will be reduced accordingly." However, the wages of miners, unemployment relief funds, and social welfare funds will be paid as usual. The pensions of war veterans will also be re-examined. Widows of soldiers killed in World War I who have remarried will no longer receive the pensions that their deceased husbands were entitled to receive. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau reiterated today in response to questions from reporters that there is no change in the U.S. silver policy. Congressional silver proponents also do not acknowledge any further developments. However, experts are very cautious about the future, because although the recent purchase of large quantities of physical silver by the U.S. in London indicates that the U.S. is still active in the silver market, silver prices are still trending downward.

Therefore, after the opening, market prices fell back, similar to yesterday's closing prices. Grains are still firm due to spot demand.</p>
<p>Rubber</p>
<p>London: The London rubber market was quiet this morning. At noon, the transaction price for October/December futures was six and sixty-two five pence, unchanged.</p>

<h3 id="e68">British Veterans Delegation Received by Key German Figures <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Former Enemies Shake Hands and Reconcile</p>
<p>(Berlin) The British veterans delegation, invited by the German Nationalist Association, the Disabled Veterans Association, the Steel Helmet League, and the Officers Association, arrived here yesterday. The groups hosted a banquet, during which Ribbentrop, Hitler's representative for negotiating disarmament issues, delivered a speech, stating, "Our goal is to turn veterans of all countries from enemies into friends, especially people from England, France, and Germany. As for the friendship between Germany and England, there is originally nothing to dispute between the two countries. Furthermore, the recent naval agreement between the two countries is a preliminary achievement in establishing peace, which should be clear to the world." Subsequently, Major Gottreley, the chairman of the British delegation, delivered a reply, stating, "Although England only fought against Germany once in the past, from the standpoint of the British veterans delegation, that war was a mistake, and it should not be repeated in the future. Furthermore, I, representing all the veterans of the British Empire, wish to declare to you here that during the Great War, we held the German soldiers in great respect," and so on. After Gottreley finished speaking, he presented the Cross of Honor to the following individuals on behalf of the British Veterans Association: Labor Minister Seldte, Ribbentrop, and Colonel Reinhardt, leader of the German Veterans Association. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) This morning, the British veterans delegation laid a wreath at the European War Memorial before visiting Hitler at the Chancellery. Hess also rushed to attend, and disarmament envoy Ribbentrop and Oberlint, president of the Veterans Relief Association, were also present. Oberlint also hosted a banquet for the British delegation at the Kaiserhof Hotel. Ribbentrop spoke the most, first describing the establishment of the Veterans Association, which aims to maintain friendship on the battlefield. The social work achieved by soldiers from England, France, and Germany is admirable. He then stated that he firmly believes that the work accomplished by veterans is valuable, but there is also a historical mission with a broader scope than this work that urgently awaits completion by veterans, and this mission is to harmonize international emotions. Respect for the enemy's spirit fosters friendship between individuals in warring countries, so why can't we develop this spirit from individuals to nations? This is the true mission of veterans. Participating in political movements or influencing the policies of one's own government is not the duty of veterans, but they should create a good situation so that politicians can conclude effective and lasting agreements. England and Germany have no differences. Finally, Ribbentrop quoted Hitler's recent declaration that Germany will do its best to seek friendship with England in order to prevent both countries from experiencing the scourge of war again. Colonel Cortreley, the spokesperson for the British delegation, replied that the delegation believes that the war between the two countries was a major mistake and that it should never happen again. He also believes that lasting peace should be based on mutual respect. At this time of latent crisis, there should be a common bond to ensure security, and that bond is friendship. He and his colleagues firmly believe that this trip will definitely promote Anglo-German friendship. (National News Agency, 15th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Senator McCarran opposes the US-Russian trade agreement and opposes Secretary of State Hull's signing of the agreement. Today, he submitted an amendment to the Senate, attaching it to the amendment to the Agricultural Adjustment Act currently under discussion, in order to abolish reciprocal tax rates. McCarran said that the agreement was a "Santa Claus" treaty, calling Hull the "greatest fool in the diplomatic world." What he hates most is that the Soviet Union owes the United States a total of 700 million yuan in debt, of which 400 million yuan is new debt after the Russian Revolution, and has not yet repaid a single penny. Hull has now signed a trade agreement with them. Therefore, he advocates that Congress should immediately withdraw its power to conclude preferential trade agreements. He once said that the US-Russian treaty was not concluded based on reciprocal tax rates, but it is closely related to them, because all the president's privileges come from that bill. Fei also solemnly declared that the agreement only allows Russia to enjoy the same rights as those who have signed trade agreements with other countries, and the condition for the exchange is that Russia promises to purchase goods in the United States. As for the manganese-producing states' claim that after Russian manganese is imported, the American manganese industry will be greatly affected, Fei replied that the entire US manganese industry employs only 354 workers, and the total output is only 10% of US usage.

<p>(Tokyo) Technician Kato, dispatched by the Ministry of Home Affairs to survey the site of the Kanmon Straits National Highway Tunnel, has completed preliminary investigations and consulted with the military. The specific plan decided by the Ministry of Home Affairs is to build a tunnel under the Hayatomo Strait at a total cost of 8 million yen. Geological surveys will take two years, and the tunnel construction will take three years. The plan is as follows: (1) On the Shimonoseki side, a 1,400-meter tunnel will be built under the Maeda area of Danoura. From the center of the tunnel, a tunnel will be excavated to connect to the seabed, exiting at Moji Nagasaki, and then passing through a 720-meter tunnel to the surface. (2) The tunnel will be 7.5 meters wide, separating roads for cars and bicycles. (3) At the intersection of the underground tunnel of the national highway on the Shimonoseki side and the undersea tunnel, a Rotunda-style traffic control device will be installed. (Dentsu, 16th)</p>

<h3 id="e72">River Water Has Receded Slightly, Wuhan Embankments Still in Danger, Zhang Embankment Has Hundreds of Holes and is Full of Peril, Exploding Pinghan Railway Tracks to Divert Xiang River into Yangtze River <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Communication: The river water receded by two inches today. Although the Wuhan dikes are no less dangerous, this has greatly comforted the citizens. A section of the Wuchang Hui Embankment Yongbao Sluice was found to have collapsed inward today. On the Wuwei Road side of the Wutai Sluice, the embankment collapsed by a length of more than ten feet. The Wujin Embankment also collapsed by three feet. Troops sent by the garrison headquarters, together with rescue workers, desperately tried to rescue it and have plugged all the gaps. Among them, the Wu Hui Embankment is riddled with holes and has become incurable. It is still feared that it will inevitably collapse. The rice fields inside the embankment will be ripe soon, and can be harvested in three or four days if they can last. Therefore, although it is known that defense is impossible, one has to do one's best. It has been discovered that the Zhang Gong Embankment in Hankou has ten sections of collapse, including Huangjiawan, Jinkou, Gusaoshu, Jinyin Lake, Fenjin Furnace, Zhayan Port, Chen Yangjing, Huangjiashangwan, Xiawan, Xiaowan, and others. The section at Gusaoshu is the most dangerous. On the 14th, that section collapsed very long. After 20,000 people tried to rescue it, it was repaired this morning. Another section in the same place was found to have collapsed again today, about thirty feet long. The "Bao" character watchtower at the corner of the embankment is leaking about a hundred meters, and the "He" character watchtower is also leaking, with the risk of the entire embankment collapsing. Ye Peng, who is in charge of flood control, was ordered to command the municipal government, the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, and military and police and civilians to station at the embankment for rescue. An office was established on the 14th, and general mobilization continued today. The most dangerous section of Gusaoshu is commanded by Ye himself, the Daijiashan embankment corner is commanded by Mayor Wu Guozhen, and the Jinkou section is commanded by Jin Jutang, chief of staff of the military police department, with complete wartime preparations. A temporary military court was also organized at Gusaoshu to enforce rescue efforts under military law. The office was established on the 15th and immediately issued a notice saying, "For the purpose of notifying everyone, the Zhang Gong Embankment is of great importance to the safety of life and property of more than 800,000 people in Hankou. This commander will supervise the rescue efforts to reverse the crisis. All employees should be disciplined according to military law. Those who disobey orders, or do not abide by discipline, or do not take responsibility, or neglect their duties, will be severely punished according to military law depending on the severity of the circumstances. Those who work hard and establish achievements will also be rewarded according to their merits. It is hereby announced so that everyone is aware." Ye said that the Zhang Gong Embankment is diseased all over, and is full of perils. Having been appointed in a time of danger, I will be driven by my conscience, and I am determined to take responsibility and do my best. I am currently working on organizing the embankment defense workers, with soldiers from the garrison brigade as squad leaders, squad leaders as platoon leaders, and platoon leaders as company commanders, all militarized to ensure discipline and communication. If an accident unfortunately occurs, it will be dealt with according to military law. Ye also said that the water level of the Xiang River is too high, and the embankment is too thin to withstand the pressure of the flood, resulting in extreme danger. He specifically reported to Zhang Xueliang, the director of the garrison headquarters. At 5:00 PM on the 15th, Zhang sent a battalion of engineers to the embankment corner to destroy the Pinghan Railway tracks at Chenjiaji, in order to release the Xiang River water outside the embankment into the Yangtze River, which was also quite effective. If the river does not rise again, lives can be saved. It is noted that after the disaster in 1931, the Jianghan Engineering Bureau was responsible for the repair and defense of the embankment, but the section below Danshui Pool was contracted by the Hankou Municipal Government. The dangers this time occurred within the scope contracted by the Jianghan Engineering Bureau. Yang Silian, the director of the bureau, has rarely been at work during the days of rescue, which has aroused the dissatisfaction of the citizens. He suddenly resigned on the 14th, which is no different from desertion. Although he claimed to be recuperating, there is no trace of him. All newspapers have reported this in detail on the 15th. Also, the flood control funds for this year were approved by the Economic Commission for 200,000 yuan, and later increased by 100,000 yuan, totaling 300,000 yuan. As of the 14th, Yang had spent 370,000 yuan. All subsequent expenses have not been settled. Zhang Qun, the chairman of the provincial government, has urgently telegraphed Chairman Chiang to ask the Economic Commission to allocate an additional 200,000 yuan for flood control to relieve the emergency and avoid delays. When the dikes were alarming, Gao Yihan, the inspector of the two lakes, repeatedly sent personnel to the dikes for inspection, strictly examining the diligence and laziness of the staff, and secretly investigating whether the repair personnel had dereliction of duty. If there are those who fail to repair the dikes effectively, they will be impeached according to the facts. (15th)</p>
<h3 id="e73">Shashi Submerged in Water, General Embankment Still Safe, Corpses of People and Animals Drifting Downstream, Food Shortage, Homes Gone <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao Shashi correspondent reported that Shashi City is now under water, and the city is full of hungry people whose fate depends entirely on the support of the general embankment around the city. The embankment still stands today, but after the great flood, there are many gaps. It is now fixed with the last bean bags. After the water has caused the beans to swell, the gaps can be filled. Shashi was flooded in several places on July 3rd when the river water rose sharply. On the 5th and 6th, there was heavy rain, so the river water was even higher. Jingzhou City, which is located lower, is surrounded by water. The city gates were quickly closed to prevent the influx of huge torrents. Foreigners in Shashi hired a boat and sent several brave people to rescue the county magistrate, but because the heavy rain continued and the water level gradually rose, it was difficult to do anything. Thousands of foreigners and refugees gathered on the large pile of stacks on the slope of the general embankment, where the Shashi packaging factory is also located. Before long, the Shashi Needle Felt China Bank branch, the Bank of Communications branch, etc., sent their valuable documents and deposits to that place. But the victims kept coming, and there was almost no room to accommodate them. The place is about fifteen to twenty feet below the water surface. Before long, the water suddenly dropped by a foot, which must have been caused by a breach in the embankment. It was then learned that there was a breach upstream and downstream, and the low-lying areas had become a swamp. It was also heard that the county magistrate and the people trapped in Jingzhou City were suffering the calamity of fish. On the 7th, more and more refugees came, because their homes had all been submerged. Fortunately, the general embankment is still safe today, but there is a shortage of food and homes have disappeared. Trees and complete houses are often seen floating in the water, with all the doors and windows intact. It is feared that there are still people living inside. The corpses of people and animals and various utensils are drifting downstream, too many to count, and it is shocking to see. The heavy rain stopped on the 7th, but the flood had no sign of receding on the following day. On the 9th, Western women and other powerful people in the city took refuge downstream on Wuhu steamers passing through Yichang. Foreign men remained here. The water gradually receded on that day.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Shandong Yellow River Breach Water Passes Through Jining, Main River Water Has Fallen Significantly, Middle and Lower Reaches Still in Emergency <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Communication: Regarding the situation of the breach of the Yellow River in Yu Xi, according to the long-distance telephone report from Jining last night (14th), the Yellow River water is still continuing to flow southeast. One branch flowing towards Yuncheng County has completely passed through the county, entering the Zhu River and the Zhao Wang River in the southeast, flowing southeast along the riverbed, and heading towards Nanyang Lake. On the afternoon of the 14th, the flood water had already passed Jining to the south (25 miles west of Jining City). Jining County Magistrate Zhen Guangyuan convened an emergency meeting. Fearing that the flood water would continue to flow southeast and overflow eastward, the county urgently mobilized civilians, day and night, to build civil levees on the east side of the river, raising and thickening them to prevent the Yellow River water from flooding eastward. The water flowing towards Juye has reached the Lijiazhuang and Huangzhuang areas in Jiaxiang County, not far from the city. Jiaxiang is rushing to build civil levees to protect the city and prevent flooding. This water flow is extremely vast, with no end in sight, and the water head is more than two meters high. The water flowing towards Heze has reached the Qili River area. County Magistrate Chen Yizhi supervised and led civilians to build dikes along the river to defend. The water flowing towards Dongping has reached Daimiao, 25 miles west of the city. The water flow is so large that it has breached two openings on the south bank of the Qing River, flowing towards Nanwang Lake and Shushan Lake. As for the Yellow River water level, it is continuing to fall. At 6:00 PM on the 14th, the River Affairs Bureau reported that Damajia in the lower reaches fell by 3 centimeters, the water level was 14 meters and 8 centimeters. Xieziwan fell by 6 inches and 6 points, the water level was 18 meters, 7 inches and 7 points. Guanzhuang in the middle reaches fell by 5 inches and 1 point, the water level was 34 meters, 2 inches and 7 points. Luokou fell by 9 centimeters, the water level was 29 meters, and there was no danger.</p>
<p>In Shandong Province, in addition to the first breach which is still easy to block, the other breaches in the upper reaches of the Yellow River have large and rapid water flows, and are likely to merge into one. Zhang Lianjia, the director of the River Affairs Bureau, and Han Duofeng, the inspector sent by the provincial government, both believe that the river water is too large and construction is difficult, and have requested that materials be prepared and the blocking be carried out after the water flow has subsided slightly. However, Li Yishe, the chairman of the Benefit Committee, sent a telegram urging the River Affairs Bureau to dredge and block the breach. Li also inspected the Dongzhuang breach with Kong Xiangrong. Seeing the serious situation, they requested that post-disaster relief be arranged quickly. Zhang Xuanxiao, Jia Han Duofeng and Sun Zherang are now discussing solutions in Dongzhuang. The water from the breach has entered the Zhu River and is spreading eastward. All counties are rushing to repair dikes. From Qili River to Jining Nanyang Lake, the river defenses are flooded. In the Heze branch, there is a tendency to change course and follow the old course of the Yellow River. The middle and lower reaches are still in urgent need of assistance. According to the disaster report inspected by Han Duofeng, the situation is extremely tragic. Han Fuju intends to send a telegram to expand the scope of begging for assistance in order to save the victims. (15th)</p>
<h3 id="e75">Minister Chiang Kai-shek's Speech on the Responsibilities of Youth (Continued) - Chengdu Attendance at Expanded Memorial Week <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The points mentioned above are to explain the responsibilities and cultivation that you young people should shoulder. I believe you all understand them very well. Now, I can use two sentences that I often say to summarize the principles mentioned earlier, which are: "The purpose of life is to enhance the life of all mankind; the meaning of life is to create the continuous life of the universe." This is where the meaning and purpose of our existence lie. Many of the things mentioned above can be summarized into these two sentences. Everyone should know that heaven, earth, parents gave birth to us, and society and the nation educated us, making us grow up, read, and learn skills. What is the value and purpose of all this? If it is for personal glory and wealth, for clothes to wear and food to eat, then one is an unambitious and unpromising person. This is not the purpose for which parents gave birth to me, society and the nation raised me, and schools educated me. The fundamental purpose of our birth, growth, education, and learning is to save the nation, save our compatriots, and especially to seek happiness for the majority of poor compatriots, to enhance the lives of all mankind. Moreover, life is only a few decades long and will eventually end in death. We must be able to inherit the historical life of our ancestors and parents and create new life for future generations, so that the new life of the universe will flow and progress endlessly. Only then, although our bodies may die, our spiritual life can be in harmony with the universe. Only in this way will our life have true meaning. We are human beings, and each individual should live a purposeful and meaningful life. Therefore, we must strive and sacrifice everything to enhance the lives of people and create the life of the universe. For example, now we must work hard to carry out the suppression of bandits and the revolutionary cause of national revival, and this is how it is. Secondly, to fulfill our extraordinary responsibility of saving the nation and the people, we must have many important conditions, of course, but the most important condition is to first have a strong physique. With a strong physique, we can then have a strong spirit, be able to shoulder heavy responsibilities and go far, endure hardship and hard work, and accomplish great undertakings. This is a very obvious principle, and everyone must know it. I think that the physique of you young students is really too poor. Like today, you have been standing here for less than an hour, and it is still morning, not the most intense time of the sun, but many people have fainted today. With such a poor physique, how can you save the nation? You must know that now, young students are fighting with sunlight, air, and cold water all day long, regardless of how hot or cold it is, how strong the wind is, how deep the water is, or how heavy the rain and snow are. They are always practicing running, carrying heavy loads and climbing mountains, or swimming. These things, and the hotter the weather and the heavier the rain and snow, the more energetic they are and the more vigorously they practice. Therefore, young people are able to have strong physiques and vigorous spirits, and the entire country and nation are also very strong as a result. Therefore, if we want to do great things in the future and save the nation, we must also intensify physical training. School principals, faculty, and parents must pay attention to students' physical education and no longer listen to them hiding in houses to avoid sunlight, rain, cold, and heat, developing into weak and listless sick men, as in the past. Moreover, to improve physical education, it is not enough to rely solely on one or two hours of exercise or sports on the playground every day. We must also pay attention to organizing the following various training activities: First, extracurricular competitions. All kinds of competitions that are beneficial to the body should be held once a week for small competitions and once a month for large competitions to increase students' interest in physical education and cultivate their habit of exercise. Second, field exercises, such as hiking trips of dozens or more than ten miles, swimming, mountain climbing, running, and other exercises, are all very beneficial to physical education and should be held frequently. Third, camping exercises. Although the general Boy Scouts are said to have camping exercises, they are too few. In the future, not only the Boy Scouts but also the students of each school should hold them once a month to cultivate their habit of competing with nature, thereby strengthening their physique, boosting their spirits, and enhancing their courage. Fourth, labor service, that is, as mentioned earlier, the daily life affairs of the family and school, whatever they can do and should do, they should do themselves to cultivate the habit of labor. They should also serve their parents, teachers, friends, and the general public in society to promote the spirit of service. In this way, they can also get opportunities for exercise. In any case, school faculty and family elders should always think of various ways to train the physique of their students and children, making them a citizen who can compete with any difficulties and dangers. At the same time, they should also pay attention to medicine and hygiene, prevent diseases, and immediately treat students if they become ill. Physical examinations should also be conducted once a month to see how their physical strength changes. Those who have increased their physical strength should be given special rewards to encourage everyone to pay attention to cultivation and physical training. Those whose bodies have become weaker should also be given special warnings and exhortations to pay attention to training and turn weakness into strength. This is a very important matter, and school principals and faculty should pay special attention to it. In addition, there is another matter concerning educational policy that school principals and faculty should also pay attention to, which is to promote production education. The most important part of production education is agricultural production education. Each school should specially set aside a piece of land as a place for students to engage in supplementary farming, gardening, and animal husbandry, so as to arouse students' habit of labor and interest in agricultural production, as well as knowledge and skills. In the future, when they graduate and return to their hometowns, they can engage in agriculture and animal husbandry, becoming independent producers of society and the nation, and not parasites dependent on families and society. At present, schools have not paid attention to this point, which is really a major shortcoming of education. I hope those responsible for education will think of ways to achieve this, and students should also understand this principle and learn this essential skill for earning a living that Chinese citizens must have.</p>
<p>Finally, I have one more suggestion to offer to the principals and faculty of all universities and middle schools, that is, you should refer to the current laws and regulations to organize a faculty group, a group for joint research and discussion of this kind. The purpose of organizing this group is to enable all of you faculty members to keep pace with the times in terms of first-rate knowledge, physique, and spirit, and to set an example for students, leading them to become healthy citizens. You should also hold meetings frequently to discuss and improve education and all practical and feasible methods. Even things that our faculty members cannot do themselves can be submitted to the educational administrative authorities for adoption. Furthermore, we must jointly and consistently maintain the school's discipline and the overall academic atmosphere, so that education can improve every day. I have many ideas about this method, but I cannot elaborate on them today. Please study and consider them yourselves. In any case, I hope that all principals and faculty members will make special efforts to ensure that Chengdu's education can change with each passing day and become a model for education in the whole country. I hope that all of you will adhere to this grand purpose and move forward to fulfill the responsibility of saving the nation through education, so as not to fail the deep expectations of the nation and the people. Since I came to Chengdu, I have spoken to leaders from all walks of life six times, and each time I have talked about the direction and essence of education. If you can all do it conscientiously, I believe that with the progress of education, it will not only be easy to build a new Sichuan, but also to quickly build a brand-new Republic of China. Today, because the weather is very hot and you Boy Scouts have not developed the ability to compete with the sun on a regular basis, many people have been unable to hold on. Therefore, today I have only talked about a few programs in general. The principles in them should be elaborated on in detail by you group leaders, principals, and faculty members to tell your students, especially to pay attention to physical training, so that at least when you convene and speak again, no one will faint again, so that everyone can become upright young students, self-reliant, and healthy citizens with independent personalities, able to build on the past and open up the future, save our country, and revive our Chinese nation, worthy of being descendants of the Yellow Emperor and citizens of the Republic of China.

<p>Chen Fugen, a key suspect in the kidnapping and murder of Han Jingsheng, a wealthy businessman from Wuxi, is 28 years old and from Wuxi. He was previously arrested in Shanghai but was released on bail due to lack of evidence. After his release, Chen took a train to Suzhou and hid at No. 53 Tieping Lane. Han Jingsheng's son learned of this and reported it to the Second Special District Court in Shanghai. On the 15th, the court sent detectives to Suzhou who, together with the police from the 24th sub-station of the Public Security Bureau, arrested Chen Fugen at his address. He was taken back to the sub-station, where he confessed to kidnapping Han Jingsheng, demanding a ransom of 2,500 yuan, and receiving 10 yuan. He was handed over to the General Bureau on the 16th, and the Shanghai detectives returned to Shanghai that evening. On the 17th, they prepared a document and came to Suzhou to escort Chen back to Shanghai for interrogation.</p>

<p>The Wuxi Tea and Restaurant Industry Association believes that the tea tax and banquet tax in Wuxi are harsh and should be abolished. They have repeatedly telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Donation and Tax Supervision Committee, requesting their abolition. The Tax Supervision Committee raised the issue for discussion at a meeting and resolved: (1) Although the tea tax is considered to be abolished, according to the investigation by Commissioner Zhang Zhongren, local people in the county have requested that it be temporarily retained and should be decided at the final summary meeting after the entire investigation is completed. (2) The banquet tax is a luxury consumption and is not among those to be abolished. Moreover, the regulations are common in all counties, and the tax rate is only 5 percent, with exemptions for amounts below 2 yuan, which does not harm integrity and should not be discussed. The Supervision Committee has copied the draft resolution and sent it to the Wuxi Chamber of Commerce for separate notification.</p>

<p>At the intersection of the fourth and seventh districts of this county, there is a newly emerging market town called Donglai Town, which is quite prosperous in commerce. The entire town was suddenly robbed by bandits the year before last. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 15th, it was attacked by bandits again. The home of Fang Yulan, a villager of the first household of the first Jia of the sixth Bao in the town, was suddenly attacked by several bandits, all armed with guns and white cloths wrapped around their heads. After entering, they tied up all the members of the family, young and old, and poured cold water all over Fang Yulan. Fortunately, the ropes binding him were slightly loose, and he was able to escape through the back door to Sishui, where he reported to the town's commercial corps. The corps then went to surround Fang's residence. When the bandits heard the alarm, they fired guns to resist arrest. The commercial corps also returned fire, and after about a few minutes, the bandits were defeated and all escaped through the back door to Sishui, with none captured. Later, they heard the victim calling for help and realized that the bandits had gone far away. According to statistics, the losses amounted to about 1,000 taels of silver. They also picked up 14 items left behind by the bandits, including the National Evening News and the Xibao, one each. It is suspected that the bandits came from the Xijing area.</p>

<h3 id="e84">Rescuing Industry and Commerce - National Treasury Vouchers Issued Yesterday - The Loan Review Committee Urges the Ministry of Finance to Approve Measures <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee received national treasury vouchers worth 20 million yuan yesterday afternoon as the second guarantee for rescuing industrial and commercial loans, and will send them to the China National Products Bank for safekeeping. The Committee is using 15 million yuan of these national treasury vouchers as the second guarantee for mortgage loans. As the regulations for banks and money shops to undertake these loans have not yet been instructed by the Ministry of Finance, it was resolved at the fifth meeting to request instructions from the Ministry, and a letter urging the Ministry was also recorded and sent yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>National Treasury Vouchers Issued Yesterday</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance allocated national treasury vouchers worth 20 million yuan as the second guarantee for industrial and commercial mortgage loans. The Loan Review Committee previously established measures for the custody and use of the vouchers with the China National Products Bank. After being approved by the Ministry, the vouchers were issued to the Committee at 3:00 PM yesterday. The vouchers consist of twenty pieces, each worth one million yuan. The Committee is scheduled to send them to the China National Products Bank for safekeeping today and tomorrow.</p>
<p>Urging the Ministry of Finance to Approve Measures</p>
<p>In recent days, the industrial and commercial sectors have been quite concerned about loan matters and have been going to the Loan Review Committee to inquire about the exact measures for mortgage loans. The Committee believes that the Ministry of Finance has not yet approved the measures for banks and money shops to undertake these loans. Therefore, this point was raised for discussion at the fifth meeting a few days ago, and it was resolved to request instructions from the Ministry on whether this mortgage loan has been decided, and which bank or money shop will undertake it. If it has not been decided, then the Ministry is requested to promptly order the banks and money shops to negotiate and agree on the undertaking as soon as possible. If the Ministry has other measures, it is also requested to approve them as soon as possible. The Committee Chairman, Mr. Cai Zengji, has already recorded a letter to the Ministry requesting instructions yesterday.</p>
<p>National Products Manufacturers Request Urgent Rescue</p>
<p>The National Products Manufacturers Association believes that credit mortgage loans are far from certain. Yesterday, they sent a special letter to Cai Zengji, Chairman of the Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee, stating: "Dear Sir, in recent years, disasters have been frequent, and the people's livelihood is haggard. Coupled with the impact of the global economic recession and the devastation of the American silver policy, the countryside is gradually going bankrupt, and cities are collapsing one after another. Shanghai is the national industrial and commercial center, and the impact is such that the market is deteriorating. Since the year-end accounts of the previous year, the financial turmoil has been dangerous, and factories and shops have closed down one after another. The crisis of the economic situation and the shock to social order are unprecedented. For self-preservation, the industrial and commercial community has appealed to the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts. The government has taken pity on the people's plight and attached importance to the national foundation, and has issued 100 million yuan in financial public bonds to consolidate the credit of banks, 15 million yuan in mortgage loans, and 5 million yuan in credit loans to save industry and commerce, and has gathered talented people to organize a Loan Review Committee to jointly save the crisis, and has appointed you, sir, as the Chairman. You, sir, are an advanced member of the Party and the country, and have been in charge of Shanghai's finances for many years. You are familiar with the situation and are deeply gratified to have found the right person. However, industry and commerce are in a critical situation and urgently need the government's loans to be realized as soon as possible. They are eagerly looking forward to prolonging their survival. For four months, news has spread in the newspapers that plans have been made to rescue industry and commerce, and that loans for rescue are about to be realized. However, the actual framework for the loans only began to be finalized on the 9th with the approval of the Ministry of Finance. The procedures and measures for credit loans and mortgage loans are extremely slow and tortuous. The 15 million yuan mortgage loan must be made by each bank itself, reported to the Loan Review Committee for review, and then the national treasury vouchers will be issued as the second guarantee. The banks and money shops that have been identified for credit loans have not yet registered. The mortgage loans must also be submitted by your Committee to the Ministry of Finance for inquiry, and it is unclear whether the participating banks and money shops have been decided. In this situation, the date of realization of credit loans and mortgage loans is unknown. Even if they are realized, Shanghai's industry and commerce will inevitably collapse due to unbearable fatigue. Moreover, the funds for rescue are entrusted to banks and money shops that are difficult to protect themselves, and the review of loans is controlled by your Committee. The request for rescue from banks and money shops should come before the request for rescue from industry and commerce. The fire is already raging, but the brave warriors who claim to be firefighters are still drowsy. What in the world is more unpredictable than this? You, sir, are familiar with the situation and know the situation well. We earnestly implore you to understand our suffering and speak frankly to the authorities, to rescue industry and commerce from danger, and to save the people's livelihood from overturning. A single word can revitalize a country, and we hope you, sir, will plan for it."</p>

In the future, the head office will be set up in Shanghai, and branches will be established in other places such as Guangzhou, Hankou, Tianjin, Beiping, Nanjing, and Hangzhou. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Flour Mill Association yesterday stating: "Dear Sirs, we recently received a telegram from the Taixian County Chamber of Commerce stating that when local wheat began to enter the market, a large number of foreign wheat was dumped in time, which not only caused the outflow of silver but also harmed the countryside. Please order manufacturers to stop ordering foreign wheat immediately, otherwise, severe penalties will be imposed. Both commerce and agriculture will benefit from this."</p>
<p>The Chamber has approved of this, and the message is being forwarded to your Association. Please check and inform your affiliated factories to purchase local wheat as much as possible. This is our sincere hope."</p>

<h3 id="e91">Closure of the Banque Franco-Chinoise Branch in Xiamen - Debtors Wire Shanghai for Help <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Banque Franco-Chinoise has absorbed a considerable amount of Chinese currency since its establishment. Depositors are now aware that the bank's absorption of large sums of money has a significant impact on the national and social economy, so they have been withdrawing their deposits one after another. Branches in various locations have also been closing down one after another, resulting in significant losses for depositors. After the Xiamen branch suddenly closed on July 1st, all responsible personnel fled. The thousands of depositors in the area formed the Xiamen Banque Franco-Chinoise Creditors' Group to jointly address the situation. The group sent an express mail telegram to appeal to all sectors of society across the country. The original telegram stated: "The Banque Franco-Chinoise has established branches throughout the country, absorbing a significant amount of currency. Considering just the Xiamen branch and the Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, Anhai, and Kinmen sub-branches, the amount is in the millions. People in society, due to its prize-linked savings, which resembles gambling, have been opposing and denouncing it. On July 1st of this year, the Xiamen branch suddenly closed down. Manager He Chengzhi and key personnel Liang Jiliu and Liang Youquan had already fled without a trace. The Zhangzhou and Quanzhou sub-branches also closed down simultaneously. Like a bolt from the blue, the masses were shocked. Depositors gathered on July 4th to form a creditors' group and petitioned the Xiamen Municipal Public Security Bureau and the local court to arrest and investigate. It has been found that the branch committed fraud on a large scale and intentionally absconded. Most of the depositors are ordinary people, and their hard-earned savings have been lost, causing deep pain and suffering. The financial turmoil is affecting the social economy, causing even greater harm. We urgently request the leaders of the Party and the country to uphold justice and impose strict sanctions. We also hope that depositors in various locations will unite and form creditors' groups to jointly address the situation, thereby promoting liquidation and protecting their rights and interests. The national economy and the people's livelihood depend on this. We hereby report this by telegram. Respectfully, representatives of the Xiamen Banque Franco-Chinoise Creditors' Group, Wu Kebin, Yang Xing, Sun Deqi, and others, along with thousands of depositors, respectfully appeal."</p>

<h3 id="e101">Progress on the Yangtze River Pooling Agreement is Smooth - Expected to be Implemented on August 1st <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The Yangtze River Six Companies' Pooling Agreement previously encountered obstacles due to the Nissin Company's proposal to increase its business share, leading to repeated postponements. It was learned yesterday that the Nissin authorities no longer insist on the pooling percentage, the obstacles have been removed, and progress is smooth. Preparations such as inspecting ships have begun. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Nissin Company's Sympathy</p>
<p>Previously, the Nissin Company felt that it would be at a disadvantage if it joined the pooling agreement, as its cargo transportation on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, such as the Hankou-Yichang route, was more prosperous than that of other companies. After discussions among the five shipping companies, it was agreed with the Nissin authorities that the pooling agreement would be based on the overall business, and there would be both advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, the transshipment of British ships was also included in the pooling agreement. It is now understood that after several negotiations, Nissin has understood the situation, and there are no obstacles to the progress.</p>
<p>Rushing to Complete Procedures</p>
<p>The second postponement was originally intended to take effect yesterday to facilitate the six companies' calculation of the pooling percentages. However, the six companies have a total of 65 Yangtze River ships within the pooling range, with a total tonnage of over 170,000, and 88 barges, also reaching about 200,000 tons. The first step in implementing the pooling agreement is to inspect all Yangtze River ships and barges to determine the recognized tonnage, which will be used as the standard for calculating the percentages in the future. However, due to the large number of ships and barges, and the fact that they are not all in one place, the inspection can only be carried out in batches. Yesterday, the six companies held another meeting to rush preparations such as ship inspections and decided to start soon.</p>
<p>Implementation Date</p>
<p>Since it was not possible to implement the pooling agreement yesterday, the six companies had already telegraphed the various companies in Yichang, Hankou, Jiujiang, Anqing, and Wuhu for information. The third scheduled implementation date is the 22nd. However, a reporter from this newspaper spoke to a representative of the six companies yesterday, who said that there were no other issues with the pooling agreement itself. The current discussions are only about the complexity of the various procedures. It is difficult to say whether the ship inspection and tonnage determination can be completed by the 22nd. The feasibility of implementing it on the 22nd is still uncertain. It is likely that the implementation date will be around August 2nd.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Lawyers Association Suggests That Court Hearings Can Be Postponed <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association yesterday suggested to the various levels of courts in the city that if scheduled court hearings cannot be held on time, postponements should be allowed. The written submission stated: "Regarding the suggestion that if scheduled court hearings cannot be held on time, postponements should be allowed, according to a proposal by member Xu Zuoliang, the courts in Shanghai are now conducting trials according to the New Life Movement, and all trials are conducted on time. However, in practice, judges and lawyers still inevitably encounter obstacles. (1) From the judge's perspective, for example, Case A is scheduled for 10:00 AM, Case B is scheduled for 10:30 AM, and Case C is scheduled for 11:00 AM. They are tried in order. If Case A is complicated and needs to be extended by an hour, if the judge takes into account Cases B and C, then Case A will inevitably be handled hastily. If the judge handles the case in detail, it will have to be extended and Cases B and C will be delayed. This is one difficulty. (2) From the lawyer's perspective, lawyers in Shanghai currently practice in five courts, including the High Court and the local courts. Court hearings are scheduled to begin at 10:00 AM in one court and at 11:00 AM in the local court, with a difference of one hour. Since there is no time conflict, they can be handled concurrently, and there is no need to appoint a sub-agent. If the judge encounters a complicated case and the trial is extended by one or two hours, or if the judge takes temporary leave, the acting judge may postpone the trial due to the sudden increase in cases. In this situation, lawyers are often unaware of the cause and wait quietly for a summons, wasting one or two hours, which is common. Cases that could have been handled concurrently due to the lack of time conflict end up being missed. It is difficult to achieve both. Furthermore, both Cases A and B may not be able to be handled in court. For example, if Case A is postponed due to the judge taking leave, and the lawyer rushes to Case B, they will have already missed the deadline. The client often thinks that the lawyer is not doing their job properly, but the lawyer is in a difficult situation. This is the second difficulty. In my humble opinion, if the court cannot hold a hearing on time, the lawyer should be allowed to request a postponement of one or two hours, or one or two days, to avoid inconvenience for both parties. The association submitted this to the 199th joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees, and it was resolved that member Xu's proposal was not without merit and should be forwarded to the court to request adoption and implementation. In addition to submitting it separately, we hereby submit this document to request that your court review, adopt, and implement it for the public good."</p>

<p>This year, a severe earthquake occurred in Quetta, India, causing immense suffering. The Indian community in Shanghai felt deeply affected by this tragedy. Through the efforts of Indian personnel from the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department and various prisons, a total of 845.50 Chinese dollars was raised. This amount, combined with the 250 Chinese dollars granted to the Indian Charity Fund in Shanghai to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the British Emperor's accession to the throne last month, brings the total to 1,095.50 Chinese dollars. All of this money has been handed over to Mr. Bailey, the British Consul-General in Shanghai, to be remitted to India for disaster relief.</p>

With a loud bang, scalding steam and debris scattered, injuring everyone on board. Upon hearing the news, the Customs immediately dispatched a rescue boat for assistance. An ambulance transported the Westerner to the Country Hospital, while the two Chinese were taken to Renji Hospital. The nationality, surname, and age of the Westerner are unknown. One of the Chinese men was named Wang Xiaodi, a local resident, aged 34, who was the captain of the launch. The other was Tang Bingjin, from Zhejiang, aged 29, who worked as a security guard. Fortunately, their injuries were minor, and they were discharged from the hospital after receiving treatment.</p>

<h3 id="e112">New Seaside Bathing Beach Opened at Qijiadun on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway - Boundless Sea and Sky, Myriad Phenomena - Nothing Surpasses It for Relaxation and Enjoyment - Opening Scheduled for July 21st <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway travels south from Minhang along the coast, with the Jinshanwei area protruding into the sea, where the waves are magnificent. At Qijiadun, the area forms a bay, with Jinshan and Zhapu mountains standing in the sea like natural emerald screens. The beauty of the scenery is unmatched in the suburbs of Shanghai. During this hot summer, the sea breeze is refreshing. Sitting and gazing into the distance, one sees a boundless sea and sky with myriad phenomena. Gulls skim the water, sails appear and disappear. Nothing surpasses it for relaxation and enjoyment. Moreover, the beach is flat, the sand is clean, the tide is gentle, the depth is moderate, the water contains salt, and the air is fresh, making it ideal for swimming and escaping the summer heat. It is only sixty miles from Shanghai, with direct car access since the highway was completed. Westerners have been flocking there to swim. However, there was a lack of adequate facilities to meet the needs of visitors. Local individuals, Zhang Zhongcai, Zhang Bolan, Zhang Mingguang, and others, passionate about community service, have utilized the surrounding scenery to develop a seaside bathing beach. Construction began this spring, incurring considerable expense. After half a year, it is now nearing completion. The bathing area covers over five hundred mu, vast and spacious, with grassy banks that are neat and charming. The interior buildings include rest rooms, changing rooms, a refreshment hall, fresh water rinsing rooms, and bedrooms, all well-proportioned and comfortable. Cold drinks, tea, and snacks are readily available. Water sports equipment, such as swimsuits, rowing boats, examples of canopy tents, and large umbrellas, are also well-equipped. It is rumored that the beach will be opened on July 21st, adding another scenic spot to the suburbs of Shanghai during the long summer.</p>

<p>Although there were strong winds and heavy rain in Shanghai the night before last, it was brief. Yesterday morning, the scorching sun was high in the sky, making the heat even more intense. The evening was even more stuffy, with no wind at all. People seeking relief from the heat on the streets were covered in sweat. Working in such conditions was unbearably difficult. Yesterday afternoon, around 3:00 PM, a carriage with city license number 117, Concession license number (English) 20, and (French) 24, was traveling to the intersection of Guling Road and Changsha Road when the horse suddenly collapsed from heatstroke. Despite the coachman's efforts to cool it with ice, it remained unable to stand until 8:00 PM. A reporter from the Datong News Agency also inquired by telephone with the Beixizang Road Emergency Isolation Hospital. The number of patients increased sharply yesterday, with 190 patients at the Shanghai Isolation Hospital and 345 patients at the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital.</p>

<p>The board of directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society held its 20th meeting last Friday. Attendees included Mr. Massey (Chairman), Peng Jin, Yi Zitong, Zhu Maocheng, Gu Songmao, Xie Andao, and Tao Deman, among others. Statistical reports were presented, indicating that all aspects of the Mutual Aid Society's work were progressing well. For example, twenty-two tea stations have been established by the Society. The Medical Committee convened a meeting on June 24th, and its reports and recommendations have been approved by the board of directors. The minutes of the Personnel Committee meetings held on the 19th, 27th, and 28th of last month were also passed. The budget proposal for the next year was prepared by the Program Budget Committee and submitted to the board of directors for detailed discussion. As a result, the proposal was approved in principle, but the details still need to be compared and reviewed. Roughly speaking, the monthly income is approximately 14,885 yuan, while the expenditure is 13,703 yuan, leaving a surplus that can be used for unexpected needs. The main categories of expenditure are listed below:</p>
<p>Social insurance, relief, and medical care: 6,815 yuan, accounting for 50%</p>
<p>Administrative expenses: 3,300 yuan, 15%</p>
<p>Education and sports activities: 1,253 yuan, 8%</p>
<p>Bathing: 1,415 yuan, 10%</p>
<p>Tea and recreation: 440 yuan, 4%</p>
<p>Dormitory facilities: 310 yuan, 3%</p>
<p>Furthermore, the board of directors discussed in detail the livelihood issues of rickshaw pullers after the registration deadline. Once rickshaw puller registration becomes mandatory, how will those who fail to register be supported? The board of directors resolved to establish a separate "Special Relief Committee for Unregistered Rickshaw Pullers" and appointed Massey, Xie Andao, Zhu Maocheng, Wang Zhiren, and Peng Jin as committee members to conduct investigations and make recommendations. In addition, improvements were made to the implementation procedures of the Mutual Aid Society's education program. In the future, the children of rickshaw pullers, including adults, will not only be taught reading and writing but also handicrafts as a mandatory part of the curriculum. Mr. Chen Heqin from the Education Department was invited to assist with this matter. At the end of the meeting, Mr. Gu Songmao proposed that the Mutual Aid Society establish a free tire replacement station. Mr. Gu stated that the hot weather makes tires prone to bursting, and a free replacement station would save rickshaw pullers time. After discussion, the board of directors agreed that while this would greatly benefit the rickshaw pullers, the nature of the work falls within the rickshaw owners' responsibilities, and the Mutual Aid Society could not undertake such a significant responsibility. Furthermore, the three social workers of the board of directors had resigned. The board of directors approved the resignations and expressed its regret.</p>
<h3 id="e115">The Taxpayers Association Will Appeal Again for the Pushcart Industry - Continuing to Request the Shanghai Municipal Council to Cancel the Increased Levy - The Pushcart Industry Association Sends Letter Requesting Participation in the Protest <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association sent a letter yesterday to Mr. Philip, Acting Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, stating: "Regarding the increased levy on pushcarts, we have already written to your bureau, based on facts and legal principles, requesting its cancellation. We have received a letter from the Shanghai Pushcart Industry Mutual Aid Association, which states: 'Our pushcart industry relies on physical strength to transport goods for customers, earning a meager income to make a living. The current Municipal Council's decision to double the levy on our industry during these difficult times has left us bewildered and shocked. Our members find it difficult to accept and dare to express our grievances as follows: (1) The cost of a pushcart is only about 20 yuan, but after the increase, the total annual levy will exceed the cost. If all types of freight vehicles on the market were subject to taxes exceeding their cost, what would that be? Why should our pushcarts be singled out for harsh treatment? (2) Since the emergence of trucks and other vehicles in the market, the scope of our pushcart industry has been narrowed by environmental pressures and is already struggling to survive. It is like a leaky house being hit by wind and rain. (3) Shanghai is an East Asian metropolis, and recently, it has been hit by the international economic recession, and frequent droughts and floods have led to rural bankruptcy, affecting all industries. The sharp decline in passenger and freight traffic has been particularly severe for our industry. (4) What all industries need today is rent and tax reductions. Only in this way can we sustain the precarious situation and avoid total collapse. Therefore, landlords are voluntarily reducing rents, and the authorities should also consider reducing levies to adapt to the situation and prevent unemployment from continuing to expand in order to ensure public order. The levy on our pushcart industry was originally 2.5 yuan per quarter, which was already considered heavy compared to other freight vehicles. How can we bear another increase? (5) In terms of vehicles meeting market needs, trucks are indeed fast for transporting goods. However, if there are not many goods, hiring a truck is economically impractical. Replacing them with ordinary small carts is too heavy and prone to tipping. Pushcarts are still the most suitable and stable choice, so the market cannot do without them. There is an objective reason for this. (6) It is estimated that there are more than 14,000 to 15,000 pushcarts in the city, and more than 100,000 people directly or indirectly rely on them for a living. Now, the increase in the levy will deprive them of their livelihoods, which will undoubtedly increase social unrest. In summary, considering the current situation and the special circumstances of our industry, we should be discussing tax reductions, not tax increases. We, the members, have no choice but to present our plight. We have long admired your association's understanding of the suffering of our laborers. We respectfully request you to lobby the Municipal Council to cancel the increased levy to ensure our livelihoods.' Representatives from the association came to the meeting and poured out their grievances, which brought tears to our eyes. Your bureau has doubled the levy on pushcarts, raising it to more than half of their cost. If it is only a matter of revenue, then we should implement the new method of collecting municipal general levies proposed by our association's general assembly of representatives. I am afraid that the increased amount will certainly be more than just 100,000 yuan per year. If it is out of consideration for the difficult times and we must stick to the old ways, then why must we burden the coolies who can barely earn enough to eat with the feeling of having nothing to look forward to, just for a new revenue of more than 100,000 yuan? The number of unemployed people in Shanghai is increasing daily, and the municipal authorities should provide relief, not exacerbate the situation. We strongly believe that the proposed increase in the levy should be cancelled immediately, so as to ensure their legitimate livelihoods. This is beneficial to both the public and private sectors. Sincerely, To Mr. Philip, Acting Secretary-General of the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council."</p>
<p>The Shanghai pushcart industry representatives Chen Xiaoming, Feng Taoyuan, and Wang Wenyuan, etc., specifically sent a letter to the pushcart industry mutual aid society to jointly protest the Municipal Council's increased levy, the original text of which reads: "Dear Sirs, We have learned that the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council's Transportation Department has, without considering the current difficult times, suddenly decided to increase the vehicle levy on our pushcarts amidst this economic downturn. Forced by the need to make a living, we have collectively decided to unanimously express our opposition and resolve to join your association to strengthen our collective power. We hereby write to you, and we have already sent a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Concession requesting that it be handled together."</p>

<h3 id="e118">Weak Director of the Film Industry, Zheng Zhengqiu, Passes Away - Devoted to the Dramatic Arts in the Late Qing Dynasty - Later Founded Star Film Company, Directing 23 Famous Films <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Zheng Zhengqiu, a pioneer in the Chinese film industry, suddenly passed away at 7:10 AM yesterday due to heart failure at his residence at No. 4 Anji Lane, Mu'erming Road, at the age of 48. In his early years, Mr. Zheng engaged in the New Drama movement. When the film industry arose, he turned his efforts to the development of domestic films. In addition to co-founding the Star Film Company with Zhang Shichuan, Zhou Jianyun, Dong Tianya, and others, and serving as its associate manager, he directed as many as 23 films. He also actively participated in public welfare activities, serving as the vice-chairman of the Guangdong Fellow Provincials Association, the chairman of the Chaozhou Fellow Provincials Association, and the president of Heji Hospital, among other positions. A reporter from the Central News Agency specifically visited to learn about Mr. Zheng's life and death, which are recorded below:</p>
<p>Plagued by Illness, He Suddenly Passed Away</p>
<p>Mr. Zheng had a weak constitution and was plagued by illness for many years. However, because he had great ambition for his career, he was able to release a new film every year. On the 8th of this month, when Zhou Jianyun and Hu Die returned to the country, Zheng still supported his illness to attend the welcome meeting at the Star Film Company and gave a loud speech. Unexpectedly, he would pass away in less than ten days. Zheng had been suffering from heart failure. Because he was the president of Heji Hospital, he immediately asked the Western and Chinese doctors in the hospital for diagnosis and treatment. From the 10th onwards, his condition gradually worsened. On the 11th, it became more severe and he could not speak. On the 13th and 14th, there was a slight improvement, but on the afternoon of the 15th, he finally reached a critical condition and fell into a coma. Yesterday morning, around 6:00 AM, Zhang Shichuan, Zhou Jianyun, and other colleagues from the Star Film Company were still comforting Mr. Zheng at his bedside. At 7:00 AM, he bid farewell forever. It was not expected that he would suddenly pass away within ten minutes. Mr. Zheng's body was transported to the Shanghai Funeral Home on Xujiahui Road at 9:30 AM yesterday morning. After being washed, it was placed in a coffin in the funeral parlor behind the hall. Colleagues from the Star Film Company and friends of Mr. Zheng came to offer condolences in an endless stream. Mr. Zheng is survived by his elderly mother, Madam Zhang, who is 75 years old, his wife, Yu Mengjun, who is 47 years old, three sons: Xiaoxiaoqiu, who is 24 years old, Erqiu, who is 18 years old, and You Sanqiu, who is 14 years old, and one daughter, Youqiu. Except for Xiaoxiaoqiu, who has been acting in the Star Film Company for many years, the rest are studying at the Minguo Junior Middle School. Mr. Zheng's funeral has been scheduled for 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 18th.</p>
<p>Early Theatrical Life Was Rich</p>
<p>Mr. Zheng's original name was Bochang. He was the adopted son of Zheng Qiaji, a wealthy merchant from Chaozhou, Guangdong. As a child, he was taught by Mr. Zhuang Chenghuang (who once wrote editorials for the Zhonghua Minbao in the first and second years of the Republic of China). When he was a young man, he brought two million yuan from his mother to Shanghai to do business. However, he had a special interest in drama. During the reign of Emperor Xuantong in the late Qing Dynasty, when Mr. Yu Youren founded the Minhu Bao in Shanghai, he wrote theatrical criticism under the pen name Yaofeng. At that time, Xu Zhuodai and others were launching the New Drama movement. They invited him to watch Japanese plays in the Hongkou area, which greatly increased his interest. Within two years, the Asia Film Company founded by Zhang Shichuan failed. Zheng took over all of its personnel and formed the Xinmin New Drama Society, performing at the Lanxin Grand Theatre on Museum Road. He was skilled in both male and female roles. At first, it was not successful. Later, Zheng starred in plays about stepmothers abusing children, which were very popular with the audience. Then, he joined Zhang Shichuan in co-founding the Minming New Drama Society and the Xiaowu Stage. Later, he joined Zhang, Zhou, and others in co-founding the Star Film Company, devoting himself entirely to domestic films and serving as a director. When Zheng was young, he had small stones in his gallbladder. A German doctor found a way to crush them and excrete them in his urine. Because of the excessive pain, he developed a smoking habit. A few years ago, Zheng was also persuaded by the German Dr. Himit's theory of rejuvenating the elderly and underwent tests with Zheng Zhegu. Zhegu passed away within a year, and Zheng Zhengqiu's body became even weaker as a result. Even in summer, his hands were as cold as ice. Recently, Mr. Zheng was trying to quit smoking, but unexpectedly, his heart disease worsened and he suddenly passed away.</p>
<p>His Contribution to the Film Industry Is Significant</p>
<p>Over the past ten years, Mr. Zheng has directed 23 films at Star Film Company. Although some people criticized him for being overly influenced by the New Drama style, each film was a box office success. "Flower of Freedom", "Two Sisters", and "Rebirth Flower" were particularly popular. The Star Film Company relied on him to overcome economic difficulties many times. Recently, Zheng had written another play called "Brothers", which had not yet begun filming. Many people in the current film industry have been promoted by Zheng. He is commonly respected as "Old Master Zheng".</p>
<p>A List of Mr. Zheng's Directed Films</p>
<p>Little Lover, A Little Worker, Plum Blossom Falls, White Cloud Pagoda (the above two films were co-directed with Zhang Shichuan), Twenty-Eight Beauties, Tablet of Blood and Tears, Yang Xiaozhen, Black-Clad Female Knight (co-directed with Cheng Bugao), Female Knight Saves Her Husband, The First Part of Blood and Tears Yellow Flowers, The Second Part of Blood and Tears Yellow Flowers (the above two films were co-directed with Cheng Bugao), Beauty Under the Knife, Little Comrades in the War Zone, Broken Qin Tower, Peach Blossom Lake, Red Tears Shadow, Jade Beauty's Eternal Farewell, Spring Water Love Waves, Flower of Freedom, Two Sisters, Rebirth Flower, Daughter's Classic, Passionate Patriotic Soul (one film directed by Zheng), Brothers (written but not filmed)</p>

<p>The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiahe Steamer was robbed by pirates in Dapeng Bay between Xiamen and Shantou on November 4th last year, and three people, including the business director Shen Qinxiang, the accountant Ge Liangchen, and Li Xiaobin, were kidnapped. After the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau rescued Shen Qinxiang, Ge Liangchen, and the other two on June 30th, they arrived in Shanghai from Guangzhou on the bureau's Haiyuan Steamer the day before yesterday. Shen Qinxiang immediately entered a hospital in Shanghai. He recently told a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency that Li Xiaobin had died of illness in the Pingshan pirate den in Dapeng Bay on December 7th last year. Shen and Ge were rescued by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, which sent armed police to the Pingshan pirate den on June 30th. The pirate leader Hu Chun has been captured by the police.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Record of the Opening Trial of the Great China Tragedy: Most of the Male and Female Victims, Young and Old, Appeared in Court; Judge Will Visit the Fire Site When Necessary; Judge Advises the Factory to Provide Hundreds of Yuan in Relief First <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Great China Celluloid Factory, located at No. 100, Lane 1371, Xiaoshadu Road, West Shanghai, specializes in manufacturing children's toys and ping-pong balls. Adjacent to it is Yongqing Lane, which is divided into ten alleys, mostly inhabited by commoners and workers. On the 28th of last month, at around 8 p.m., a fire suddenly broke out there, with flames reaching the sky and thick smoke billowing. The residents of Yongqing Lane scrambled to escape. As of now, twenty-six men and women have died from burns or other causes, and fifty-three others have been injured, marking an unprecedented disaster. Afterward,</p>
<p>the affected victims organized a disaster relief association, believing that the fire originated from the Great China Factory's warehouse. They hired lawyers Wang Weigu, Wei Weiqing, Sun Bawu, and others to represent forty family members of the victims, including Wu Shaowen, and filed a complaint with the First Special Court's Criminal Division, accusing the factory's manager Jiang Junyan, assistant manager and factory director Ge Tianmin, deputy factory director Qian Menglin, general manager Sun Hongcheng, chairman Zhu Rutang, and other five people of causing death through negligence and endangering public safety. Yesterday afternoon at 4:15 p.m., Judge Liu Yugui presided over the hearing in the Eighth Criminal Court. Due to the seriousness of the case,</p>
<p>many people from all walks of life came to observe. Most of the victims also appeared in court, including men, women, the old, and the young, all bearing scars. Except for Qian Menglin, the other five defendants, along with their defense lawyers Xu Jie, Ling Qihong, and Gu Yongquan, appeared in court to respond to the charges. The Public Concession police authorities also considered this case important, so in addition to sending Western officers to court to record the statements of all parties, and to ensure thorough security and prevent accidents, the District Chief of District C, a Westerner named Kai Naina, and Chief Inspector Wu Genyuan personally supervised a large number of detectives and police officers inside and outside the court, together with the original bailiffs,</p>
<p>to maintain order. Judge Liu, noting the large number of plaintiffs, ordered the election of several representatives to testify. The victims then elected Wu Shaowen, Zhou Degan, Liu Songshou, and other three people as representatives. Wu Shaowen, from Jiangbei, residing in the Eighth Alley of Yongqing Lane, stated that his home was not far from the Great China Factory of the defendants, separated only by a small alley. On August 1st of last year, the factory had a fire once before. Afterward, we, in the name of all the tenants, commissioned lawyer Wang to send a letter to the factory, requesting the demolition of the fence and the repair of the firewalls. Although they promised to repair them at the time,</p>
<p>no action was taken. Unexpectedly, on June 28th of this year, at around 8 p.m., the factory caught fire again. The fire started in the factory's storage room, which was filled with explosive materials. With a thunderous sound, the fire spread rapidly and violently, engulfing Alleys 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 of Yongqing Lane where we lived. At that time, I was cooling off when I saw the fire. Because there was no back door and the fire was extremely hot and fast, everyone climbed over the wall to the small alley and desperately escaped through the flames. Those who couldn't escape were buried in the fire pit. In this disaster,</p>
<p>thirteen houses were destroyed. Because they were all commoners, each house housed several families, so about twenty-seven families were affected. Twenty-six men and women were burned to death, and thirty were hospitalized for injuries. Besides my entire family being destroyed, five people were burned to death, and now only I am left, he said, tears streaming down his face, pleading for justice. Zhou Degan and Liu Songshou testified that four members of their families each were burned to death, and two members of Liu's family were seriously injured and are still in the hospital. The rest of their testimony was similar to Wu Shaowen's, so it was omitted. Questioned, defendant</p>
<p>Jiang Junyan testified that he was the manager of the Dahua Celluloid Factory. The factory was separated from Yongqing Lane by a small alley to the west, with no brick wall, only a fence. Although there was a fire once on August 1st of last year, he did not receive a letter from the tenants of Yongqing Lane requesting the construction of a wall afterward. Furthermore, all matters in the factory were the responsibility of the factory director, he said. Ge Tianmin testified that he was the factory director of the Great China Factory. If there were important matters, he would report them to the general manager, who would then report them to the board of directors for approval. During the fire last year, he was not at the factory, so the former factory director Qian Zhenghua was in charge. The Qian Menglin accused by the plaintiffs was not an employee of our factory, so he was completely unaware of the plaintiffs'</p>
<p>requests for wall construction. He investigated that the Great China Factory was not the site of the fire, because the raw material warehouse in our factory was closed and locked every day after 6 p.m. and had no electric lights, so how could it have caught fire? Therefore, our factory was also one of those burned. Furthermore, according to outside rumors, the fire came from Yongqing Lane, but I cannot provide evidence for this claim; it is just hearsay. Judge Liu said that the court had inspected the Great China Factory yesterday while conducting an on-site investigation in West Shanghai for another case, and saw the</p>
<p>fire originating from the factory's warehouse. Ge replied, It was not our factory that caught fire, because our factory has 170-180 male and female workers. In this disaster, besides the warehouse being destroyed, the roof of the furnace room was also burned. The room uses coal to generate steam and has two workers dedicated to it, who start work at 5 a.m. and stop at 5:30 p.m. The warehouse is about thirty feet away from the furnace room. Currently, due to the damage to the machinery in the factory after the fire, work has been suspended. However, according to outside rumors, this fire actually started from the Seventh Alley of Yongqing Lane. As for the cause of the fire, it is said that it was due to using a blowtorch</p>
<p>to cook supper carelessly, causing sparks to spread to the toilet and then to the warehouse, he said. Sun Hongcheng testified, I am the general manager and am solely responsible for distribution matters. I received a report from the factory director about the fire that night, but I was not at the scene at the time. Zhu Rutang testified that he was the chairman of the board. After receiving the report that night, he immediately inquired with the factory and was told that the fire started from Yongqing Lane due to a blowtorch. He did not know the rest of the details. Next, witness Zou Bukun from the plaintiff side testified that after the factory fire on the night of August 1st of last year, he was elected as a representative by 91 tenants and hired lawyer Wang to send a letter, requesting</p>
<p>repair of the brick wall. The former factory director Qian Menglin came forward to negotiate with me and agreed to repair it within April. Later, because I went to Zhenjiang, the factory did not actually implement the previous agreement, so I did not urge them. At this point in the interrogation, defense lawyers Xu Jie and others rose to declare that the factory's equipment was inspected by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Factory Inspection Department from time to time, and they deemed it satisfactory. Furthermore, this fire was thoroughly investigated by the Chinese and Western detectives of the Putuo Road Police Station at the time. If they had determined that the defendant was at fault, they would have already filed a public prosecution. This point should be clarified by requesting the court to review</p>
<p>the police station's report. Judge Liu stated that the responsibility for this case was not yet clear and that further investigation was necessary. He also stated that the plaintiffs were all poor civilians living in hardship, and it was especially pitiful that they had suffered this fire disaster. Therefore, he advised the defendants to provide several hundred yuan in court as a temporary relief measure, which was not an admission of liability. The defendant's lawyer agreed with this point, but stated that the factory was currently occupied by the plaintiffs, preventing it from operating. It would be best to order the plaintiffs to move out completely within two or three days so that work could resume. Furthermore, many plaintiffs were present in court, and there were concerns that after the court adjourned, they might</p>
<p>cause disturbances to the defendants. This point should be noted. Judge Liu ordered the case to be adjourned until 4:10 p.m. on the 27th of this month for further questioning. If it was deemed necessary to conduct an on-site inspection, the lawyers of both parties would be notified to appear in court. The four defendants were each released on bail with a guarantor who would appear whenever summoned. Before the bail bonds were obtained, the defense lawyers were allowed to be responsible for their release, with a deadline of 12 p.m. tomorrow to submit the bail bonds. The defendant Qian Menglin, also known as Qian Zhenghua, was ordered to be summoned to court for trial. To maintain order, all plaintiffs were ordered to leave first. The court adjourned at 6 p.m. Soon after, the defendants and their defense lawyers boarded several cars, escorted by Chinese and Western detectives from the police station, and left.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Li Guocheng Had Been Sentenced to Death; Sentence Changed to Life Imprisonment After Retrial; Li Still Dissatisfied and Decides to Appeal Again <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>On August 15th of the 20th year of the Republic of China, at around 6 p.m., in room number two of the Fa Shang Hotel, located at No. 112 Xinxiao Bridge Street in the French Concession, Jiangbei bandits shot and killed Jiang Zhonghan, also known as Chen Yiming, and Xia Yongsheng, and wounded Zhong Ziqing. The culprit escaped the scene. The next day, the French police arrested Yan Jinbiao, also known as Yan Er, also known as Yan Dongpo, from Funing, who confessed that he was instigated by Li Guocheng and colluded with Yang Jiucheng, Liu Wu, Zhang San, and others, who were at large, to shoot and kill. The police sent Yan to the Second Special Court for public prosecution, and Yan was sentenced to death. During the appeal period, Yan's family captured Li Guocheng in Rihui Port, South Shanghai, and sent him to the Public Security Bureau. They submitted a petition to the Second Special Court to have Li brought back and handed over to the police for investigation and public prosecution. During the trial, Yan was repeatedly brought in for confrontation. As a result, Li was also sentenced to death and deprived of civil rights for life. Subsequently, Yan went through three trials and the original verdict was upheld. In early April of the 22nd year, the Third High Court sent him to the Caohejing Prison for execution by hanging. Li also disagreed with the verdict and appealed to the Third High Court, but the appeal was rejected. He then appealed to the Supreme Court, which reviewed the entire case file and found that there were doubts as to whether Li Guocheng was actually present at the scene to participate in the killings. According to the victim Jiang Zhonghan, when he was in the hospital, the police brought the captured Yan Jinbiao for identification, and Jiang said that he only recognized Yan Er as the assailant and did not mention Li Guocheng being at the scene. Therefore, there were doubts about Li's criminal conduct. The Supreme Court ruled to overturn the original verdict and send it back to the Third High Court for retrial. The Third High Court has already conducted a retrial with witness testimony, and the details have been reported in the newspapers. The case has already been declared closed for debate. Yesterday was the date for the verdict. At 9 a.m., Criminal Division Chief Guo Dezhang, along with Judges Xiong Huiping and Wang Yue, specially opened the Third Criminal Court and ordered the appellant Li Guocheng to be brought to the case and announced the verdict. The original verdict was overturned, and Li Guocheng was sentenced to life imprisonment for premeditated murder and deprived of civil rights for life. The official also explained the meaning of the verdict to Li and informed him that if he disagreed with the verdict, he could submit a petition to the court within ten days after receiving the judgment and appeal to the Supreme Court. After the announcement, Li was ordered to be returned to the detention center to await instructions. It is reported that Li still expressed dissatisfaction with this retrial verdict and decided to appeal again.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Firefighters from Jiangwan Town Accused of Burning Religious Statues; Trial Concluded Yesterday, Verdict to be Announced Later <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>On April 30th of this year, residents of Jiangwan Town organized a festival to welcome the gods, carrying the three idols of the Liu Shrine around the area. As a result, an incident occurred. That evening, one of the idols was carried to an open space and burned, causing a great uproar. Afterward, the residents accused the fire brigade of initiating this action. The local police station detained Xu Liangzuo (35 years old), the captain of the fire brigade, Ni Ganchen (13 years old), Cao Weirui (26 years old), an employee, and Yin Daoxiang (17 years old, all from Jiangwan), and sent them to the local court. Prosecutor Xie Lian investigated the case and filed a public prosecution for property damage, stating that the defendants were all employees of the Jiangwan Fire Brigade. During the traditional festival to welcome the gods, the defendants had a verbal conflict and, in a fit of anger, burned three public idols of the East Temple in the town, rendering them unholy. The Shanghai Municipal Government ordered the Public Security Bureau to send the defendants to court. The investigation revealed that the fire brigade, under the guise of maintaining order, burned three wooden puppets in the open after the crowd dispersed. The facts were clear, and Xu Liangzuo and the other three defendants were released on bail pending further instructions. Yesterday at 11 a.m., Criminal Division Chief Cai Dingcheng specially opened the Third Court for the trial. The defendants hired lawyers Yao Yunbo and Zhang Zhuochen to defend them. Ni Ganchen testified first, stating that he was sick at home that day and was not present at the scene of the incident. The judge asked if he ran away when he saw the incident, and he replied no. The judge ordered Xu Liangzuo to the stand and asked why he burned the statues. He replied that it was the residents who burned them. Cao Weirui testified that he was not present at the scene of the incident and could be investigated. He claimed that he was unjustly detained in the police station for eight days. The judge asked if it was not the fire brigade who burned them, who did? He replied that he did not know. Yin Daoxiang testified that he and others were ordered by Captain Xu Liangzuo to be on duty, but he did not know who burned the idols. At this point, Prosecutor Xie arrived in court to deliver his closing argument. Then, the defendants' lawyers rose to speak for a long time, stating that the current trend is to eliminate superstition and that the defendants did not actually burn the statues. At most, they were scapegoats and requested that they be declared innocent. The judge considered the trial concluded and set a date</p>
<p>for the verdict to be announced on the 10th.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Case of Robbery of a Runner from Hongchang Bank; Record of the Interrogation of Two Robbers; The Two Robbers Were Arrested in Zhabei; Only Sent to Police Station the Day Before Yesterday <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Liu Yuqing, a runner from the Hongchang Bank on Sichuan Road, was robbed. On the 11th of this month, at 6:40 p.m., he took a chartered rickshaw, pulled by rickshaw puller Yong Caifu, to the Guangfu Road area of Zhabei to collect account payments from various rice shops, totaling 7,000 yuan, including 5,000 yuan in paper currency. Therefore,</p>
<p>he turned</p>
<p>around</p>
<p>on the bank and took a chartered rickshaw to return to the shop. Unexpectedly, while</p>
<p>passing</p>
<p>the French Concession at the southern end of the Xinzha Bridge, three robbers suddenly appeared and threatened him with guns, forcing him to go to Rongshou Lane, 546 Meibai Ge Road, and</p>
<p>robbed him. They took 5,000 yuan in paper currency and fled. Afterwards, the rickshaw puller reported to Chinese police officer No. 2137, who helped chase the robbers. During the chase, shots were exchanged, and two robbers, Zou Shuigen and Yu Chuntao, both from Jiangbei, were arrested in Zhabei. 1,000 yuan of the stolen paper currency, a handgun, and one bullet were recovered. They were taken to the Public Security Bureau for detention until yesterday, when they were returned to the Xinzha Police Station. After investigation by Detective Weng Peishang,</p>
<p>they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. The Shanghai Municipal Council prosecuted them according to Article 328 of the Criminal Law. The</p>
<p>Police lawyer Bi Juju Jiuqi arose to present the case, saying that the two defendants, together with a fugitive, robbed Liu Yuqing of 5,000 yuan in paper currency at the entrance of Rongshou Lane on Meibai Ge Road at 6:40 p.m. on the 11th of this month. At the time, the defendant Yu Chuntao was carrying a handgun, and the fugitive committed the robbery. Afterwards, they fled towards the Wuzhen Road Bridge</p>
<p>northbound. The rickshaw puller Yong Caifu followed behind, reporting to Chinese police officer No. 2137, who chased after them. At the time, the defendants were also aware of this. One of the robbers who committed the robbery first escaped, and the two defendants fled to the northern end of the Wuzhen Road Bridge. Yu Chuntao used a gun to resist arrest. The police officer returned four shots. Zou Shuigen, due to being grazed on the head by a bullet, was frightened and stopped running. He was arrested by</p>
<p>Concession police</p>
<p>The thief also threw away 1,000 yuan of the stolen paper currency</p>
<p>and ran away, but was eventually caught. The handgun was found.</p>
<p>They were taken to the Public Security Bureau. Yesterday</p>
<p>they were transferred to the police station, but when the shots were exchanged, police officer Li Yaokui was hit by a stray bullet in the back of his right foot, penetrating the sole of his foot. He is now in the Tongren Hospital. Another passerby, Wu Qiyao, was shot in the right leg and is now staying at the Red Cross Hospital. Because the bullet has not been removed, they were unable to appear in court. The recovered handgun has been examined by the Shanghai Municipal Council Weapons Inspection Office. The gun has been used in murder cases in the Concession, but the details are not yet known. Therefore, he requested permission to postpone the hearing. Afterwards, the victim Liu Yuqing and witness Yong Caifu, the rickshaw puller, testified about the robbery, saying that in addition to the recovered 1,000 yuan, there were still 4,000 yuan that had not been found. They also testified in court that the two defendants were indeed the ones who stopped the rickshaw and that Yu was carrying a handgun. Questioned, the two defendants' statements were evasive. Judge Yang reviewed the statements and ordered Zou and Yu to be returned to custody, pending further investigation at a later date.</p>

<h3 id="e128">Caohejing Prison Actively Improving; Handling of Statistics Has Received International Acclaim <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The Caohejing Jiangsu Second Prison (i.e., the Model Prison) has a long history since its establishment. It is now planning to expand significantly, build new dormitories, and improve facilities. At the same time, it will also provide education to the prisoners, which is truly a blessing for the prisoners. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Expanding the New Prison: The prison is directly under the Ministry of Justice. The original prison buildings were built before the early years of the Republic, and a large number of houses were added a few years ago. It was originally planned to accommodate 1,300 prisoners (the old buildings can accommodate 800 people, and the new buildings can accommodate 500 people). However, the number of prisoners sent from all parties has reached more than 3,000. There are 600 military prisoners, more than 100 political prisoners, 200 female prisoners, 500 prisoners held by the First Special Court of the Special Zone, 800 prisoners held by the Second Special Zone of the French Concession, 80 prisoners held by various counties, and other prisoners from various places. The prison is overcrowded. The prison plans to add a new prison, and has purchased more than 20 mu of land</p>
<p>to build ordinary prison cells, a hospital prison, and the surrounding walls have been built. The funds have also been allocated in the amount of tens of thousands of yuan. The construction can begin as soon as it is approved by the Ministry of Justice.</p>
<p>Improving Facilities: The prison is also making every effort to improve the internal facilities. The planned hospital prison will adopt the latest equipment and can accommodate 200 people. At the same time, educators will be set up to do their best to educate and reform the prisoners. In addition, prisoners will be given freehand exercises and breathing exercises every morning, all for the purpose of improving the prisoners' lives.</p>
<p>Handling Fingerprints: The prison has recently developed a fingerprint science, which is categorized in a very thorough manner. For all prisoners, as long as a fingerprint is examined, it can be found out whether they have committed crimes in the past, which is very helpful in investigation procedures. In addition, the prison is also handling statistics, including the prisoners' origin, occupation, age, etc., all of which are very detailed. This type of work is the most modern equipment in the world. Last year, an exhibition was held in the capital of Belgium, and the prison also participated with this type of statistics, which was well received.</p>
<h3 id="e129">North Station; Rickshaw Puller Returns Lost Money <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The North Station of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways has implemented a system for rickshaw pullers to escort passengers, which has been reported in this newspaper many times. The implementation of this system has greatly benefited passengers, and passengers who forget their belongings can be traced at any time. It is reported that an elderly woman surnamed Guo, who lives at No. 56 Yongfeng Lane, North Sichuan Road, took the Nanjing Express train to Shanghai at 11:30 p.m. the day before yesterday. At that time, she purchased a ticket and took a rickshaw with license No. 2524 from the Concession to her residence. She forgot a handbag on the rickshaw, containing more than 22 yuan. The rickshaw puller Sun Sancai found it and handed it over to the Samsung Rickshaw Company, which forwarded it to the Railway Bureau for the owner to claim. According to the Railway Bureau, the rickshaw tickets sold have two coupons. When the passenger arrives at their destination, they tear off the first coupon and give it to the rickshaw puller. The second coupon must be kept in case of lost items, so that they can be traced. If passengers can strictly implement this procedure, it will not only greatly protect the safety of individuals and their belongings, but also add a layer of powerful protection.</p>
<h3 id="e130">The Hurricane That Swept Through Shanghai the Night Before Last: Houses Collapsed, People Were Injured, and Boats Capsized <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Eleven Workers Injured at a Foreign Warehouse. At 7:30 PM the night before last, a hurricane swept through Shanghai. At the Xinyu Foreign Warehouse (formerly known as Xietai Warehouse), located at No. 3 Yangjiadu Ferry, Pudong, the tiled factory connecting to the gatehouse collapsed, covering an area of approximately twenty feet. Dozens of workers were inside, seeking shelter from the heat. Seeing the factory shake violently, they scrambled to escape, but eleven workers were unable to flee in time and were injured. Yang Zhongquan, the chief of the Yangjiabo police station, along with several patrol officers, sergeants, and police officers, arrived at the scene to investigate. Together with Wang Yingcai, the warehouse manager, they arranged for the injured to be taken to the Pudong Hospital for treatment. It has been determined that the following four individuals sustained relatively serious injuries: Wang Datianzi (from Suqian), Lu Xianting (from Suqian), Sun Jinxiang (from Suqian), and Chen Xuetian (from Hubei). The following four sustained less severe injuries: Lü Daxi, Zhu Decheng, Ming Changquan, and Zhai Yishuang (all from Suqian). The following three did not require hospitalization: Chi Yongxiang, Gu Dachun, and Ming De.</p>
<p>Chen Jianglin's Soda Ash Boat. Chen Jianglin, a resident of Pudong, makes a living as a boatman. He owns more than ten barges, transporting goods for various foreign firms. At around 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, he loaded two barges full of soda ash from a certain foreign firm. While sailing with the tide toward the Longhua Cape shoreline at around 7:20 PM, they were suddenly struck by a violent storm. The boatman lost control, and both boats capsized in the Huangpu River. All the soda ash fell into the river, resulting in considerable losses. It is reported that they were fully insured for marine risks. The boat crew was rescued by neighboring vessels, and fortunately, no one drowned.</p>
<p>Xu Zhaosheng's Soybean Boat. Xu Zhaosheng, a barge owner, has one barge that specializes in transporting soybeans and oil cakes for the Changde Oil Mill. The day before yesterday afternoon, he received more than 700 bags of soybeans from a foreign warehouse in Yangjiadu to be delivered to the mill. However, as he approached the Changde Oil Mill shoreline in the Nanshi area at around 7:50 PM, the wind and rain suddenly intensified. The helmsman was unable to moor the boat, and it capsized. All the soybean bags fell into the river, resulting in significant losses. The boat was not insured. The crew members were rescued, and workers are currently being hired to salvage the soybean bags.</p>
<p>Yang Jinggui's Brick and Tile Boat. Yang Jinggui's boat, loaded with bricks and tiles, was sailing from the Dujia Hang area of southern Shanghai on the Huangpu River towards Shanghai. During the storm, the bridge was blown apart, causing him to lose control of the vessel. Seeing this, Yang immediately instructed the helmsman to steer towards the riverbank to seek shelter. However, the rudder was buffeted by the wind and waves, making it difficult to steer. The boat crashed head-on into the shoreline, damaging the bow and causing it to take on water. It also struck and damaged the stern of a small Jiangbei boat moored nearby. Negotiations are underway with Yang. When the mast of Yang's boat was blown down, two helmsmen fell into the river.</p>
<p>Wei Asheng's Flour Boat. Wei Asheng, a boatman from Pudong, loaded 300 bags of flour and other goods in Shanghai. During the heavy storm the night before last, as he sailed to the southern end of the newly opened Henan River in southern Huangpu, Wei saw the wind and rain and was heading towards the shore to drop anchor and moor. However, the cargo was very heavy, and the boat was buffeted by the wind and waves and capsized near the shore. A small steamer and other boats helped rescue Wei and his four crew members. The next morning, Wei managed to salvage the boat. A considerable amount of cargo was lost, and the goods on board were soaked in water, resulting in significant losses.</p>

<h3 id="e132">A Woman Carries Red Pills in Her Trousers: Miss Wang Arrested <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Miss Wang, a 50-year-old woman from Yangzhou, has recently been transporting red pills for those engaged in the profitable drug trade. She mainly carries them from the French Concession for sale on Yangshupu Road. This was discovered by Song Bingzheng, a Chinese detective from the Narcotics Division of the Public Concession Police. At around 6:00 AM the day before yesterday, he and several detectives waited for a while near Ningguo Road on Yangshupu Road. Miss Wang arrived, and they stepped forward and ordered her to stop. They knew that the drugs were hidden in her trousers. Because there was no female investigator present, they could not search her and planned to take her to the police station. As Miss Wang passed an open space, she suddenly claimed that she needed to urinate. Taking advantage of the opportunity, she threw a bag of red pills weighing six ounces into a sewer in an attempt to get away with it. However, the detectives saw her, immediately retrieved the bag, and she claimed that a child downstairs at the Yuebin Hotel in the French Concession had given her the red pills. They went to the hotel to investigate, but this was not the case. She then claimed that Hua Xiangping, a resident of No. 51 Maoxian Lane, had asked her to deliver the pills to Erbao in Puai Lane on Yangshupu Road for sale. They went to No. 51 to arrest Hua, but he had already fled. Miss Wang and the evidence were taken to the Yangshupu Police Station and transferred to the women's detention center. Yesterday morning, she was taken to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, detailed the events. Subsequently, the Chinese and foreign detectives reported the process of arresting the defendant and presented the evidence for inspection. Questioned about it, the defendant confessed to carrying the red pills for Hua and receiving ten cents for each packet. She gave evasive answers to other questions. Judge Wu Zehan ordered her to be remanded in custody and scheduled a court hearing.</p>

<p>Shen Jinlin, a 38-year-old local employee of the Anglo-American Tobacco Company's accounting department, lived at No. 61, Lane 49, Zhangjia House, Avenue Edward VII. Recently, due to his inability to repay a debt of several thousand dollars to the company, he became despondent on the morning of the tenth of this month and took his own life by secretly ingesting opium. When his family discovered him, they sent him to Baolong Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective. He died from the effects of the poison the day before yesterday. The hospital reported the incident to the Xinzha Police Station, which ordered Detective Yang Youshan to investigate. The body was then taken to the Faillon Road morgue. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan, clerk Wang Zuyi, and others, arrived at the morgue to examine the body. Shen Zongwang, 18, a student, testified that the deceased was his father. He had embezzled $8,000 from the company, of which $5,000 had been borrowed by his friend. He did not have a loan document, so he was unable to recover the money. This made his father feel even more sad and angry, and he unexpectedly took this step, etc. After receiving the testimony, Guo concluded that the deceased, Shen Jinlin, male, had died from ingesting opium. The body was handed over to his son, Shen Zongwang, who signed a statement and took the coffin back.</p>

<p>Wang Shunlai, a 39-year-old from Ningbo, was the deputy foreman under Wu Fuchun, the foreman at the Jiangwan Race Club's stable. At 7:20 PM on the 22nd of last month, Wang Shunlai and Ma Xiaoer (from Tianjin), a stable boy, had an argument over work matters. At first, they ridiculed each other, but Ma, who was hot-tempered, became furious and resorted to violence, punching Wang. Wang was caught off guard and fell to the ground. Wang, not to be outdone, jumped up and fought back. They wrestled into a ball, and their companions tried their best to separate them. Because Ma Xiaoer was as strong as an ox and had someone else (at large) helping him, Wang Shunlai was no match for him and suffered internal injuries. After returning home, Wang felt a pain in his lower back and sought treatment from an injury specialist, but it was ineffective. He died at home at 5:45 PM the day before yesterday. His wife, Wang Dongshi, reported to the Jiangwan Police Station that her husband had been beaten to death by Ma Xiaoer. The police immediately arrested Ma Xiaoer and detained him. Yesterday morning, the deceased's brother-in-law, He Axing, submitted a petition to the procuratorate of the District Court, requesting an autopsy to clear the deceased's name. After receiving the petition, the court commissioned Prosecutor Lei Binzhang and Examiner Xuan Zhiming to conduct an autopsy in the afternoon.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Doctor Jin Songpan's New Method of Smoking Cessation <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Jing'an Hospital, Jing'an Villa, Jing'an Temple Road, has recently invented a method of smoking cessation that is completely different from ordinary methods. According to Doctor Jin Songpan, who gave a detailed explanation yesterday, he said that he used to work in the military and saw the harm caused by smoking. Red pills and white powder were particularly harmful. Therefore, he vowed to complete a method of quitting smoking. At first, he used blood drawing, blistering, and other methods. Later, according to the principles of pharmacology, all highly poisonous drugs can be neutralized, so he studied and tested them, and finally got this method. After that, quitting smoking is not difficult. It's like 606 treating syphilis, quinine treating malaria, and blood serum treating various diseases. Using this new medicine, injection on time will eliminate the tobacco poison throughout the body. Only then will the excrement of various organs have an unusual odor. After the tobacco poison is eliminated, you will never want to smoke again, and all diseases will be eliminated. The spirit feels unusually comfortable. Now he is very willing to make this method widely promoted, but his personal ability is limited. If the support of powerful people can be obtained, or the government can sponsor it, the amount will be large and the effect will be rapid. However, no matter what, we will now do our best to promote it. Dr. Jin has served as the chief of the military medical department of the Whampoa Military Academy, the chief of the military medical department of the general headquarters, the chief of the field hygiene department of the general headquarters of the first and second Northern Expeditions, and the director of the statistics department of the Ministry of Health. His knowledge and experience are excellent. Now he is in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Dear Editor, Our Lane was sealed off by the Public Security Bureau for reducing the rent and paying the branch, which aroused public outrage. From 4:00 PM on the 6th of this month, all the markets were closed. By noon on the 13th, Chen Jiufeng, a member of the Shanghai Municipal Rent Reduction Committee, was delegated to bring a letter of advice to restore business to our lane. When the branch convened a general meeting, and the two committee members Hu Jianbo and Lu Fen tried their best to persuade them, all of them resumed business early at noon on the 13th. It was discovered on the 15th that there were four sections of the fire brigade to protect the six teams of the municipal council, the 25th branch of the sixth district, the twelfth branch, a kind of mimeographed advice, which is now open for business, in order to maintain the appearance of the city, and the 14th also issued such advice from India, with narrow words, and unfathomable high depth. Today, your newspaper's local column published that the staff had been sent to advise, and later announced the industry and commerce, which is completely false. I think it is a mistake by the New Voice News reporter. I have to declare the truth in order to show my caution. I hope you will give me a history of correction. This is to the chief writer of Shen Bao. The Baoxing Lane Branch of the Zhabei District of the Shanghai Municipal Rent Reduction Committee Qi, July 16, 24.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Second Day of the Chinese Agronomy Society's Annual Meeting <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The 15th was the first day of the Chinese Agronomy Society's annual meeting. According to the original agenda, the meeting was held in the morning, and a visit to the Aviation School was planned for the afternoon. However, as the Aviation School had suspended afternoon operations from yesterday, the visit was changed to 8 AM. At noon, Zhejiang University hosted a banquet at Jufengyuan to welcome all attending members. The meeting continued at 2 PM for discussions, with Hui Jikuan as chairman and Tang Huisun as secretary. The chairman first reported on the society's progress, stating that there were a total of 2,381 members in the 23rd year of the Republic, and 113 new members had joined during this annual meeting. Regarding accounting, Chen Fangji made a report, briefly stating that the existing funds are divided into three categories: (1) the society's foundation, (2) the Fei Gengyu Scholarship Fund, and (3) the Xu Shuji Memorial Fund. The society's foundation has approximately 3,000 yuan. In addition to 2,000 yuan in government bonds, the Fei Gengyu Scholarship Fund has also acquired a Western-style house worth approximately 5,000 yuan. The Xu Shuji Memorial Fund has currently raised approximately 7,000 to 8,000 yuan. It was also mentioned that last year's accounting income was insufficient to cover expenses, but fortunately, the surplus from the previous year could be used to compensate. Liang Xi gave a more detailed report on the Xu Shuji Memorial Fund. Tang Zhuosun reported on the compilation of the series of books. Finally, Xu Fanggan reported on the situation of the Japanese branch. After the reports were completed, the location for the next annual meeting was discussed for the reference of the next council. Council member Zeng Jikuan hoped that the next annual meeting would be held in Sichuan. Furthermore, Huang Xuchu, the chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Government, specially sent Chen Daning, the director of the provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, to participate in this annual meeting and hoped that the next annual meeting would be held in Guangxi. The final decision on the location will be made by the council, according to the society's previous practice. Next, the general assembly elected nine tellers on the spot to be responsible for the election. The election results were: Zeng Jikuan, Liang Xi, Zhu Fengmei, Tang Huisun, Qian Tianhe, Cai Banghua, Shen Zonghan, Tan Xihong, and Xie Yusheng were elected as members of the Tellers Committee for this session. After the election, discussions on agricultural issues were held, divided into four groups: (1) Crop Improvement, chaired by Feng Zefang and Jin Yibao; (2) Forestry, chaired by Li Yingong and Yang Jingfu; (3) Agricultural Economics, chaired by Tang Huisun and Feng Zigang; (4) Sericulture, chaired by Sun Benzhong and Xia Zhenduo.

<h3 id="e153">Italian Open-Air School <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Integrating Compulsory Education and Health Education as a Pioneer in Eliminating Illiteracy in Italy</p>
<p>—Simple Equipment Worthy of Reference for Our Literacy Movement—</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from Rome) Our country has recently recognized that illiteracy is an obstacle to national rejuvenation and is sparing no effort in promoting literacy movements. The Italian open-air school, "Scuola Aperta," has simple equipment but achieves significant results, which is worthy of good reference for our country's efforts in promoting civic education today. Xue Guangqian, the president of the Shanghai Society, who studied in Rome, Italy, has provided the following dispatch on its organization and activities, which can be used as a practical reference for our country.</p>
<p>Objectives</p>
<p>The objectives of establishing Italian open-air schools are to promote compulsory education and health education. Children from impoverished families and those with weak health can enter free of charge to receive appropriate education. These schools are entirely established by the state and are widespread in various locations. The one established in Rome, Italy, has the longest history and the largest scope. The country recognizes that the life of the nation is tied to children. Children in superior circumstances naturally have suitable families to raise them, which can be disregarded. However, children who are impoverished and weak must be the responsibility of the state to provide guidance and protection.</p>
<p>Admission Requirements</p>
<p>Any child from the age of six to fourteen who is unable to attend ordinary schools or who is physically weak and often in an unhealthy state, after passing a doctor's examination and being deemed suitable for this type of school life, can enter free of charge. The school provides transportation to and from school every day. This transportation responsibility is handled by the street leader of each street (according to the Italian Fascist Party, each street has a street leader whose sole duty is to serve the public), so parents do not need to worry about it. Lunch and dinner are also provided by the school free of charge. Although it is only one soup and one dish, the cost is minimal, but it is nutritious and very hygienic. We know that the slogan for Italian children is "books" and "guns." Only those who are knowledgeable and physically strong are considered ideal and healthy citizens.</p>
<p>School Facilities</p>
<p>The school facilities are very simple, mostly located in large open-air gardens, with a few wooden houses inside, which are also very rudimentary, probably the reason why it is called an open-air school. The children's clothing consists of a shirt and trousers for girls, nothing else. Boys only wear trousers and are naked on the upper body (in winter, they wear a woolen shirt). Daily reading and operation allow them to live under the sunlight, which can enhance children's interest in nature and benefit their physical and mental strength. In addition to the necessary teachers, the school also has several doctors who pay close attention to the nutrition and health of the children at all times and conduct strict examinations.</p>
<p>Activities</p>
<p>The school's activities primarily focus on children's direct operation. Teachers are entirely in a guiding and cooperative role. All the children in the school are divided into groups of six to be responsible for washing, sweeping, cleaning, and cooking lunch. For example, for lunch, four people share a small table. All arrangements, food utensils, distributing food and vegetables, and washing dishes are all handled by the children themselves. In addition, the school is planted with various flowers, fruits, and vegetables, which are also irrigated and planted by the children. Since these children come from poor families, everything they learn can help their parents in their work. The teaching time is based on the principle of not using textbooks. Teachers explain orally, and older children must take notes. All reading materials, paper, and pens are provided by the school.</p>
<p>Source of Funds</p>
<p>The key to Italy's revitalization lies in economizing and rationalizing everything, using the minimum cost to obtain the maximum benefit, and seeking the most significant results in the shortest period. The open-air school is one of them. Although the open-air school is a large undertaking, the economic cost to the state is very limited. Its location is an open-air space, borrowed from the public and free of charge (or contacted with private parks, requesting them to open for borrowing). All the wood for the simple school buildings and school equipment, and all the objects used in teaching materials, are generally solicited by the school from all parties. Collecting bits to make a fur robe and accumulating small amounts into large sums. All parties also know that open-air schools are set up to help poor and weak children, so everyone is willing to do their best to fulfill the spirit and obligation of human mutual assistance. Before Mussolini came to power in Italy, illiteracy was widespread, roughly equivalent to China today (according to statistics, the percentage of illiterate people in Sardinia in southern Italy was 70% or more). Now that knowledge has developed and education has become widespread, the open-air school is the most powerful pioneering tool in this process. Today, China deeply feels that the urgency of eliminating illiteracy cannot be delayed. It is worthwhile to adopt and refer to the open-air school in Italy, which has achieved great results. However, due to the difficulties of China's finances, and the need for construction is even more complicated, so today, how to make things economical and rational, to use one person to do two people's work, and one penny to work as two penny, is the prerequisite for everything. The literacy movement is just one example.</p>

<p>Dr. Wu Youxun, head of the Department of Physics at National Tsinghua University in Beiping, was recently elected as a member of the German Academy of Natural Sciences (Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher) in Halle, Germany. Professor Emil Abderhalden, the president of the academy, has sent a letter to Wu, which is translated as follows: "Professor Wu Youxun, I am very pleased to inform you that at a recent regular meeting, our academy unanimously elected you as a member. This is to express our recognition and admiration for your special contributions to physics. I will send you a membership certificate. Very respectfully, Emil Abderhalden." The German Academy of Natural Sciences was founded in 1652 AD and is located in Halle, Germany. Its members are all world-renowned natural science experts who must have special contributions to their studies to be eligible for selection. Wu's selection this time is the first for the Chinese scientific community. This is not only an honor for Wu personally but also the glory of the academic circles in our country. It is heard that Wu is from Jiangxi Province, graduated from Nanjing Higher Normal School, and has a Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Chicago in the United States. He was a research faculty member at the University of Chicago and the head of the Department of Physics at Nanjing National Central University. Since 1928, he has been a professor of physics at National Tsinghua University. In addition to his position at Tsinghua, he is also employed as a contract researcher at the National Central Research Institute and a special researcher at the National Beiping Research Institute.</p>

<p>The inaugural meeting will be held on the 25th of this month. The venue is borrowed from Jiaotong University in Xujiahui.</p>
<p>In recent years, there have been many academic groups in China, such as physics, chemistry, biology, geography, astronomy, and geology societies. However, there is still a lack of organizations purely for the study of mathematics. Domestic mathematics circles, including Xiong Dizhi, Gu Yangwu, Hu Dunfu, Zhou Meiquan, Feng Hanshu, He Lu, Sun Guangyuan, Zhu Gongjin, Su Buqing, Zeng Zhaoan, Fan Huiguo, Huang Jiyu, Jiang Zehan, and He Yanxuan, have initiated the organization of the Chinese Mathematical Society. After several months of discussion, universities in China have expressed their support. Preparations are now complete, and the inaugural meeting will be held at the National Jiaotong University in Xujiahui, Shanghai, on the 25th, 26th, and 27th of this month. It is expected to add a unique luster to the academic community in our country.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Zhang Shilu Returns to China After Lecturing in Japan <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Shilu, a professor at Jinan University, was invited by the Chinese Language Society run by the Japanese to lecture on Chinese linguistics in Tokyo. He stayed there for about two weeks and gave three lectures. The first lecture was at the East Asia Tongwen Society, the venue for the Chinese Language Society's general meeting, on the topic of "The Phonological System of the Chinese Language." From the evolutionary history of Chinese phonetics, he inferred the long history of Chinese national culture, which was enough to move the hearts of the Japanese. The second lecture was at the East Asia Higher Preparatory School, an open lecture for students from various schools, on the topic of "The Characteristics of the Chinese Language and the Evolution of Language." The third lecture was at the invitation of Professor Takeda Fuku and others from the Imperial University, attending the Siwen Society, lecturing on "The Problem of the Subdivisions in Guangyun." This topic was more specialized. Professors and older people with beards from various schools came to listen to each lecture, taking notes non-stop, even for three or four hours without fatigue. After the lecture, they would often ask questions and inquire earnestly. The Japanese spirit of valuing academics is truly admirable. As for Zhang's feelings about this trip, he deeply feels that if we want to talk about saving the country, we must first save ourselves. We do not necessarily have to join the army or engage in politics to save the country. We can improve and deepen our studies within the scope of our respective responsibilities or what we should and want to learn, to show our achievements, which is enough to enhance the status of the country and prevent being looked down upon by anyone. This is the only true way to save the country.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Art College holds large-scale summer schools every summer vacation, which has been held for 17 sessions so far. Teachers of primary and secondary schools in various provinces and cities and those who are generally interested in studying art can use the holidays to have the opportunity to pursue further studies, which is particularly effective in assisting the promotion of art education in the mainland. The summer art normal school workshop will be held this year, divided into five groups: Chinese painting, Western painting, labor, music, and patterns. Students from each group have arrived one after another, with 16-17 provinces and 3-4 cities, most of which are recommended by the education bureaus and cultural groups of various provinces and cities. The association believes that all the students have been engaged in art education for many years and have rich experience, so it strives to impart new knowledge and study the latest art curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry of Education, which is the most practical and necessary. Liu Haisu, the chairman of the association, has just returned from Europe and will personally teach. In addition to scheduling courses, academic lectures are added every week, and Pan Gongzhan, the director of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, and He Bingsong, Tai Shuangqiu and others are invited to the school to give lectures. Registration has been very enthusiastic in recent days, and there are still vacancies in each group.</p>

<p>Subsidizing the Huanghuagang Middle School's construction costs of 100,000 yuan</p>
<p>Yan Deji, a revolutionary giant in Sichuan, was recently summoned by Chairman Chiang to the province to meet and receive instructions. He has met with Chairman Chiang, who inquired about the recent situation in detail. Yan reported on his past participation in revolutionary work, and Chiang commended him and asked him to wait for the central government to assign him to an important position. Since Yan returned from Japan during the late Qing Dynasty and participated in the revolutionary work, on March 29th, one year before the Republic of China, the Guangzhou Uprising, Yan participated in important work. The matter was revealed and the collection failed. Fortunately, Yan managed to escape. In 1932, Yan raised funds in Shanghai to establish Huanghuagang Middle School to commemorate the martyrs and promote the national spirit, achieving remarkable results. Recently, the Central Party Department has approved the establishment of the school, which Chiang praised greatly. It is heard that a subsidy of 100,000 yuan will be granted to build school buildings to expand the school.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Zhijiang High School Restores Business Courses <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>After Zhijiang High School resumed operation in 1929, it originally had three departments: business, architecture, and general studies. In 1931, for some reason, it only operated the general studies department. Recently, in view of the social need for business talents and in order to promote vocational education, it has been approved by the Education Department to restore business courses starting in 1935 and enroll first-year freshmen. The principal of the school was originally concurrently held by Huang Shijin, the director of the Department of Education at the university. Recently, as the university department will add a counseling department from the next year, and Huang will be in charge, the position of principal of the high school has been replaced by Zhang Wenchang, the director of academic affairs. Zhang will still hold the position of director of academic affairs concurrently. The school, in view of the fact that many promising students from poor families cannot afford to attend, has specially proposed 1,000 yuan from the budget from the next academic year as a subsidy for poor students. Whether new or old students, those who are in the top rank in both academic and conduct and whose families are poor can apply. There are a total of ten places this time. Each student can receive 50 yuan free of charge per semester. Therefore, students who receive this subsidy only need to pay more than 50 yuan for the first semester for food and uniforms, and old students only need to pay more than 40 yuan per semester. The school's science, library, dormitory, sports, and medical facilities are already well-equipped. Starting next academic year, it is heard that a middle school equipment committee will be specially established to improve middle school equipment. Physics and biology instruments, wall charts, models, and history and geography wall charts will all be added.</p>

<p>Two to One</p>
<p>The Beijing Yanqing tennis team played a friendship match with the Shanghai Tennis Club yesterday. Originally, two singles and two doubles matches were scheduled, but one doubles match was not played due to darkness. Zhang Ding was originally scheduled to play in the singles, but he was replaced by Ma Anquan. As a result, Yanqing won two singles matches, and the Shanghai Club won one doubles match. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Luo Xiaochao and Ma Anquan were evenly matched. The two sets had a total of 42 games and lasted two and a half hours. In the end, the two players struggled to determine the winner. The long rallies were difficult to distinguish. Luo Xiaochao had excellent net play, while Ma Anquan defended the baseline. This was Ma's point of failure. Ma took a 3-1 lead in the first set, but Xiaochao caught up to 4-4 and finally resolved the set at 11-9. The second set was equally tense. Luo Xiaojian won against Chen Yi. Xiaojian continuously attacked Chen Yi's backhand, leading to victory. Chen was too relaxed when he came on the court and could not catch up later. Doubles players Zhang Dingzhao and Tao Tingyao are veterans, and Lin Zhu and Zi Fei were no match for them.</p>

<p>In the Houquan Cup Summer Football Tournament, the performance of the freshmen from the North team, Jin Yiming, was the most brilliant. Puxing won by enduring the battle. Waihong played Gonghele in a cup match. Gonghele's goalkeeper Cen Ming and right winger Su Songmin were the most outstanding. Unfortunately, the star player Cai Yuandong was absent due to an event, greatly weakening the team's strength. Waihong's strength was average. The performances of forwards Zhu Ruihong, Chen Zhigang, He Guifang, and goalkeeper Wang Boying were the most brilliant. Unfortunately, in the second half, Waihong's player Yi Xinqian did not first declare to the referee and immediately attacked the opposing team, acting improperly, violating the athlete's morality. After a committee decision, the player's right to play was suspended. In the four matches the day before yesterday, the teams discussed their skills in the heat and respected the referees very much, which was commendable. The results are listed below:</p>

<p>— (Chan Chen)</p>
<p>Life is like a battlefield. If we stop wielding our spears and swords, we will immediately be attacked by the enemy. Ah! If we want to survive, we must fight with our entire lives!</p>
<p>The reason why human existence can be maintained, and the reason why life can obtain meaning and value, all depend on the result of striving for an ideal. Therefore, if a person has no ideal and cannot strive, then he will only forever fall into the predicament of lamenting that life is boring and uninteresting.</p>
<p>All great figures in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, all people with morality and meaningful lives, have forgotten the small self of their individual bodies and devoted themselves to the infinite greater self. Therefore, we can only obtain true meaning and value in life through this effort.</p>
<h3 id="e177">The Scenery of Lihong Bridge <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Muliang</p>
<p>The sky is just dawning, not yet fully bright, and everything is strangely silent. However, the manure wharf of Lihong Bridge is already crowded with men and women, moving out one manure cart after another lying on the manure wharf. A long line of manure carts makes a creaking sound on the asphalt road.</p>
<p>The sun slowly peeks out its red face from the clouds. Then, Lihong Bridge gradually becomes lively. The trolleybuses of routes seventeen and eighteen begin to run their routes, packed with batches of people going to work and people rushing to the early market.</p>
<p>In a flash, male and female students with schoolbags and people carrying菜 baskets to buy vegetables pass through Lihong Bridge in an endless stream, each with a different posture.</p>
<p>Especially a group of foreign vagrants (Russians) and beggars are particularly active. The foreign vagrants have learned a pure Mandarin accent and beg for money from close-by Chinese people, hoping to exchange it for a day of food and drink. The beggars' method of begging is that they wait for friends sitting in rickshaws to pass over the bridge, and then help the rickshaw pull over the bridge, and then beg for money from the friends sitting in the rickshaw. This situation is no different from the Old Gate Bridge and Tianhou Palace Bridge.</p>
<p>A red Ford card, strangely tall, with a machine gun mounted on it, is seated with nine patrolmen, how majestic! A gray Ford card followed behind, speeding quickly to Lihong Bridge. The beggars and foreign vagrants all shouted: "Hey: The red man's car is coming, run away quickly!"</p>
<p>Following the panicked shouts, the order on the road was in complete chaos. The imposing patrolmen had already caught several people like an eagle catching chicks, and the people who were watching the show all gathered together at the same time.</p>
<p>The police car, full of beggars and foreign vagrants, left with its bell ringing. Then, the air in Lihong Bridge temporarily felt a little calmer.</p>
<p>The weather gradually turned dark, and the manure wharf of Lihong Bridge was finally so silent, with two or three hundred manure carts lying there lifelessly, as if forming a manure cart kingdom.</p>
<h3 id="e178">The Life of a Dog <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Yijie</p>
<p>I occasionally recall the two common sayings, "Better to be a dog in times of peace than a person in times of chaos," and think of several kinds of dog lives.</p>
<p>One type is the pampered Pekingese dog. There are very few of these dogs, probably not even one in a thousand. Its owner is either a foreigner or a modern woman. It is accustomed to a comfortable life, eating its fill all day long, doing nothing. Its food includes beef, toast, and eggs. It sleeps in a Western-style house and has a wire bed or a beautiful wool carpet. Sometimes it even gets to ride in a car. Its material enjoyment is truly worlds apart compared to all ordinary dogs.</p>
<p>One type is the tolerably well-fed kitchen dog, also known as a grass dog. There are not many of these dogs either, but about ten percent. It depends on the chef for a living. Although it cannot eat beef and eggs, it can eat its fill of white rice, leftover food, and cold dishes. Although it cannot sleep on a wool blanket or ride in a car, it is warm enough to take from a soft woodpile. Compared to other dogs, it is much more comfortable.</p>
<p>One type is the labor-style guard dog, mostly grass species. There are more of these dogs, accounting for about fifteen to twenty percent. However, the treatment it receives is very harsh. Its food is coarse grains, at most vegetable soup and meat bones. It sleeps on bluestone slabs or cement, which is lower than the kitchen dog.</p>
<p>One type is the unemployed stray dog. It has no owner. There are the most of these dogs now, almost everywhere you look. It runs in the streets all day long, exposed to rain and sun, unable to get its fill. It is forced to search for filth in garbage dumps or toilets to fill its stomach, making it the most unfortunate and pitiful of all dogs.</p>
<p>In summary, in today's world of economic depression, not to mention people, even dogs are affected.</p>

<p>When he arrived in his room, the room attendant brought in tea and said with a smile: "Mr. Cheng, let me tell you a piece of news, that Zhu family girl has already been sold." Zhichan said: "Didn't you tell me last night?" The room attendant said with a smile: "I did say it last night, but if that girl had run away in the middle of the night, the deal wouldn't have been considered done. Now that the person has spent a night in Mr. Jia's arms, and the silver dollars have also spent a night in Mrs. Hu's pit, it is considered sold whether it is sold or not, and it is considered done whether it is done or not." Zhichan was washing his face, so he said lightly with a smile: "You all wish that such things would happen every day. No matter what, you can always get a few dimes as a happy money." The room attendant said with a smile: "We wouldn't want a few dimes for marrying such a virgin bride." Zhichan said: "Then, how much did Mr. Jia give you?" The room attendant said: "Not every room attendant gets something. You always have to be the person in charge to get a little benefit. I'm considered very good, I got three silver dollars." As he spoke, he revealed most of his teeth and laughed. Zhichan said: "You people who are dividing the spoils on the sidelines are laughing appropriately, but do you know that the person who sold herself is already crying very sadly." The room attendant was stunned and stood there and asked: "Mr. Cheng, did you see the bride crying?" Zhichan said: "No, no, I was just guessing like that." The room attendant didn't take his words to heart. He was busy in the morning and went to take care of the other rooms for the travelers. After a while, the room attendant hurriedly walked into the room and said to him in a low voice: "Mr. Cheng, you really guessed it, isn't that girl crying? Now that she has food to eat and clothes to wear, and her family for two generations won't starve to death, she should be happy. I don't understand why she has to cry." (266)</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>No matter what the thing was, she always felt that it was extremely irritating, so that she could no longer bear it, and said loudly:</p>
<p>"If we continue to sit here like this, it will really bore people to death. We must go out of the palace and stroll around in the long corridor." (Translator's Note: The long corridor is under the Paiyun Hall in the Summer Palace. Not only is it very long, but also it is constructed in an extremely magnificent way. People in the palace call it the long corridor). "Hurry up and prepare to go with me! Go and inform the others!"</p>
<p>Because when I was first summoned into the palace this morning, the Empress Dowager had already instructed me to stroke her forehead with my hand to test her temperature. Now that she wanted to go out, I automatically said that she should let me test her temperature. She immediately agreed; but I felt very embarrassed after trying it. Originally, although her fever had been reduced a lot compared to the morning, it had not yet returned to normal. When my palm covered her forehead, I still felt a little hot; looking at her spirit, it was still not very cheerful. I was originally a very enthusiastic person and very concerned about her, so I had no choice but to offer some advice.</p>
<p>"Old Buddha, please be patient for a while longer, okay?" I said: "Your fever has not completely subsided yet! It's best not to be exposed to the wind; walking in the long corridor is certainly more open than sitting in the palace, but it is inevitable that you will be exposed to the wind, and it is too hard!"</p>
<p>She was obviously shocked by these words: I was completely confused at the time. (366)</p>

<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>"White-haired girl," this term has never been heard of before. In fact, it is not surprising, because although she is old, she is still like a maiden. She has never been engaged to anyone since she was a child. Therefore, her temples gradually turned white, and she unknowingly became the oldest owner in the family. Almost all the seven daily necessities are not handled by her. His surname and residence are temporarily hidden for him, but his life and experience are worth mentioning.</p>
<p>"White-haired girl," in terms of the same clan, the younger generation generally call him "Uncle ×," maidservants or even call him "Miss Tai," although his status has not been married, residing in a position of seniority, all accounting of silver and money, daily expenses, if not according to his budget, no matter which young master and young mistress, are not allowed to act without authorization, so "white-haired girl," since the death of his parents, in these thirty years, the fields and houses inherited have been kept without any shortage. Not only is the expenditure enough to spend, but also waiting for the younger brother who has been adopted to come of age, marry a wife, and maintain the bloodline of a surname, is this not a very respectable thing? Among the neighbors, hearing the reputation of "white-haired girl," some see him being able to take power, praising him as a "woman in man's clothing," some see him being good at managing the family, respecting him as a "heroine" who has restored the × surname, all啧啧称羡. You, if you don't mention "white-haired girl" then never mind, but if you ask about "white-haired girl," huh! You can dare say that everyone in this place knows it.</p>
<p>This year, a certain newspaper reported that it was "the year of old men getting married." One day, the "white-haired girl" saw it, and he laughed: "Alas! This is probably because the reporters made a mistake in the title. What is the reason? Isn't it that those who marry old men are all 'old maids'?" However, those "old maids," at first each held the principle of not marrying for life, but when they reached the age of fifty, I don't know why, they wanted to be a shy "new bride" once, I always feel a little unclear," these few words, "white-haired girl," said very humorously, so I made this small biography for him, to see that "white-haired girl" is indeed worthy of his name!</p>

<p>— Zhu Yun</p>
<p>When I saw the news of Wen Xiaoxia's suicide in the newspaper, my heart skipped a beat. Xiaoxia was a young friend of mine and a neighbor; his round face and shy demeanor were endearing. But this young man actually committed suicide in a hotel, and as I looked at the photo of him in the newspaper, my heart was filled with endless sorrow.</p>
<p>Although Xiaoxia came from a humble family, he was so clever and eager to learn. Before I moved, Xiaoxia and I often played together. After I moved, driven by the pressures of life, I gradually became estranged from Xiaoxia. However, through his letters, I learned that he was an apprentice in a silk and satin shop. In five years, because of his prudence and intelligence, he had been promoted from apprentice to assistant to the chief accountant. That such a promising young man would commit suicide filled me with doubt.</p>
<p>According to the newspaper, Xiaoxia's suicide was due to unemployment and homelessness. How could such a cautious young man, whose shop had not closed down, become unemployed and homeless? To verify the cause of my friend's death, I prepared to make an on-site visit to the hotel where he committed suicide, but before I could leave, the postman in green delivered Xiaoxia's last letter of farewell to my hand.</p>
<p>With trembling hands, I tore open the envelope containing Xiaoxia's hurried handwriting. Inside were two sheets of stationery from the hotel, the handwriting so careless. The letter began with the sentence: "Dear Brother Yun, Xiaoxia has committed suicide!" It continued: "By the time this letter reaches your hands, the news of my suicide will have already met your eyes. The reason for my suicide, you may not believe. But I have indeed been dismissed from the shop and driven out of my home because of my excessive absurdity. This all started last summer when I met Lan Ying, the executioner who killed me, in the movie theater. She is a regular customer who often buys fabric from our shop, and we knew each other. We sat together, and she was so incredibly beautiful that we moved from talking about the movie to talking about everything. She was too captivating. One movie, and we became friends. Brother Yun, I have always considered myself a passionate man, and Lan Ying was truly enchanting. At the time, I felt it was such an honor that such a beauty would become my lover, so I often went out with her. Of course, I didn't pay attention to my duties at the shop, and to cover my expenses, I gradually embezzled from the funds I handled. As a result, in half a year, I embezzled over two hundred yuan. Fortunately, my master was kind and only dismissed me, without strictly pursuing the embezzled funds. When I returned home, my parents were, of course, furious, but I was so in love with Lan Ying that I felt carefree without a job. However, since I had no income and Lan Ying needed money, I disregarded everything and repeatedly stole and sold valuable items from home, until my father gave me a severe beating and drove me out. And Lan Ying, upon hearing the news of my expulsion, broke up with me. Brother Yun, I wanted to join the army, but my body has been so ruined that I am weak and useless. What can I do? It's over! Everything is over. Love is truly a dead end that lures one to suicide! Xiaoxia, last words."</p>
<p>After reading this letter, my hands trembled so much that I could not hold the tear-stained stationery. I listened as the wet letter fell to the ground, and I no longer had the strength to pick it up.</p>

<h3 id="e183">Finance: September Gold Tender Opens; Market Turns Bullish After Weakness <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Anticipation of Rising Silver Reduces; Numerous Rumors Stir Buying Sentiment</p>
<p>Yesterday, the September gold tender opened. Although overseas silver markets fell and satisfaction was difficult, the market initially appeared weak. Later, the expectation of rising silver reduced, and morale recovered. Buying sentiment and rumors flourished, leading to a rapid turnaround. Early morning trading was affected by falling overseas silver markets in London and stable markets in the US. There was talk among traders that the US would continue to advance after the close. The final transaction price had risen by 0.0625. Montedelli forward silver prices fell by 2.5% and rose by 1% respectively. Exchange rates rose slightly, and London spot gold fell by 1.5 pence, causing slight unease. Pre-market trading opened lower at 52.3 yuan, with sellers still eager, further retreating to 50 yuan and 51 yuan. It only began to be supported after reaching a low. It pulled up slightly. After opening, the Central Bank's listed prices were revealed: London remained stable, the US rose, and the customs gold unit fell by 2%. The standard price for gold tender was listed lower at 868 yuan. Sentiment weakened again, and sellers gathered, retreating into the 50-yuan range. Banks also showed selling interest, and the domestic market hardened, weakening at one point. HSBC and others took advantage of the cheap prices to cover their positions, and buyers became active at the lower prices, recovering to above 50 yuan. HSBC's listed prices showed that the UK and the US remained stable, and as the Central Bank still showed selling interest, prices retreated further. Later, banks slightly covered, and large accounts occasionally bought, causing prices to rise. Unexpectedly, the Hong Kong market opened weaker, and sellers were still eager, retreating back into the 50-yuan range. However, in an instant, it recovered again. The spot market seemed dry, and buying interest fluctuated from time to time, causing prices to rise again. Reuters reported that Indian silver was predicted to rise by one anna. The market tended to be stable at midday. The after-market opened with a weak trend, falling as sellers remained eager despite Hong Kong's slight easing. However, the initial report of a one-anna reduction in Indian silver stimulated the market and caused prices to rise. Banks sold at the higher prices, and the second report of no change in Indian silver led to some fluctuations. However, with the market's positive sentiment, large accounts joined forces to buy. Rumors flourished, and buying interest was strong, eventually pushing prices close to the 60-yuan mark. The market turned bullish after weakness during the day. According to the premium on futures, the price rose again. The day's market situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 852.3 yuan, down 2.6 yuan from the previous close. The Central Bank's listed customs gold unit was down by a small amount. Dada, Yingxiang, Fu'an, Huixiang, Hengyu, Fuxing, Yongfu, Yuda, Fafa, Yongtong, Yuyuan, and Kangxiang sold off. Citibank came out and traded. Citibank 875 gradually retreated into the 50-yuan range. The August prompt was settled at 6875 and fell to 47.6 yuan. Macquarie picked up September USD 125. Wanfeng, Houchang, Yongda, Hengyu, Chunyuan, and Yongna were at auction, rising to 9.5 yuan.

<p>Yesterday, after the large ups and downs of the past few days, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw a gradual weariness in investor sentiment. Although the volatility was still very strong in the early morning, it showed signs of becoming quieter later on. If there are no new developments in the environment, it may temporarily fluctuate for a while. Yesterday's events: At the opening in the morning, the number 53 of the compilation of legacies and education was absorbed in large quantities, and the market price progressed from 34.5 yuan to 5.3 yuan at the closing, a difference of as much as 0.8 yuan. Investor sentiment suddenly became enthusiastic. The reduction of troops followed, also rising by about 0.5 yuan. Later, all bonds rose by several corners or more. But then, the sales tax and number 53 had sales, and the average person knew that the increased price was for a different purpose. The market atmosphere suddenly became weak, and the various bonds suddenly fell.

<h3 id="e187">Yarn and Cotton: Marked Yarn and Cotton Gradually Improving <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to rise, and the situation is gradually improving. Because the decline was too long, and the weather has been hot recently, the production of yarn mills has decreased. At the same time, the spot yarn sales market is more active, and the number of chips in the yarn and cloth warehouses is decreasing daily. It is said that there are only about 6,000 bales left, of which 2,000 to 3,000 bales are in the hands of brokers. Therefore, in the absence of unexpected events, the recent marked yarn may be expected to rise.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster continues to rise. At the opening of the previous market for marked yarn, each month consistently trended upward, and the situation was good. Spot Sichuan merchants are actively buying, and at the same time, there are many yarn mills that have stopped production for summer vacation, so the number of outputs is inevitably reduced. In addition, the rising power of raw cotton is even stronger, which has stimulated the rising yarn market. Another saying is that the Fugui yarn of Hengfeng Factory may not be delivered, and the number of chips is expected to decrease, so the surface is hard, and the buying atmosphere is strong. As a result, each month rose by 1.1-1.2-1.3-1.4 jiao. A total of 350 bales of Tongji were sold, 550 bales of Yukang, 350 bales of Yuanda, 1,350 bales of Jinchang, 450 bales of Ruida, 500 bales of Junchang, 1150 bales of Hengde, 400 bales of Runkang, and 300 bales of Dachang. 350 bales of Yida were bought, 450 bales of Dafeng, 800 bales of Heyu, 450 bales of Taichang, 450 bales of Xiacheng, 500 bales of Yongda, 1,100 bales of Tonghe, and 1,600 bales of Xincheng. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices during the day are as follows.</p>
<p>Actual sales are not bad. The spot yarn sales are still good. According to statistics, the total number of bales bought by various brokers throughout the day was 2,741 bales, including 1,800 bales of medium-term futures. The market rose by over one yuan. Daily yarn transactions were 200-300 bales. The amount of purchases by each broker is as follows:</p>
<p>Changsha 20, Haizhou 60, Sichuan 2,200, Guangdong 170</p>
<p>Anqing 30, Shantou 30, Jiangxi 105, Mainland 25</p>
<p>Ningbo 6, Shaanxi 220, Fujian 5</p>
<p>The cotton market is trending firm, and the rising trend is strong. Recently, the gold tender has risen, and foreign cotton has been stabilized, resulting in high calculation prices. At the same time, the floods in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River are becoming more serious, and the damage to cotton fields is quite large. The Han merchants are buying, and the buyers of Chen cotton have an even deeper concept of squeezing the air. It is heard that there are already 3,700 loads of cotton that have been inspected and qualified by the cotton inspection office.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Buyers are enthusiastic. At the opening of the previous market for marked cotton, each month was stable. Because American cotton was 5 pounds per inch, and Indian cotton fell 1 rupee 75. The situation in the market was soft with hard. As soon as the second and third rounds were auctioned, the market atmosphere suddenly became tight, and buyers rushed in. It is heard that the gold tender market price is stable, and the Chen cotton bulls are still not letting go. As for new cotton, some mainland factories bought a little. The market was tight, so each month consistently broke through the 2-yuan mark. Judging from the market situation, new cotton may see a price of 33 yuan. As a result, each month rose from 1.5 jiao to 3.4.5 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. A total of 2,400 loads of Jifeng were sold, 1,200 loads of Yukang, 3,200 loads of Yuanda, 1,300 loads of Chang, 3,900 loads of Dufeng, 1,100 loads of Junchang, 1,500 loads of Yichang, 1,300 loads of Yikang, and 3,200 loads of Changhe. 1,700 loads of Yuda were bought, 2,600 loads of Dafeng, 1,300 loads of Renfeng, 2,700 loads of Yuanyi, 1,700 loads of Runkang, 2,500 loads of Tonghe, 2,800 loads of Yuanxing. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices during the day are as follows.</p>
<p>The demand for raw cotton is flat. The demand for spot cotton mills is average, but the yarn sales have improved somewhat, and there may be hope for activity. The source is estimated to be 1,100 bales of Yao cotton, 39.35 bales of Tongzhou cotton, 1,000 bales of spot sent to the Shenxin factory, and 47.00 bales of Lingbao cotton, 13 pieces of spot sent to the Yufeng factory.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed firmness and stability due to surging prices of foreign wheat. Chicago rose by a significant 78 jiao, and Canada increased by 4 fen. Market sentiment was influenced by the rebound in foreign wheat prices and the continued severe flooding along the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers. As a result, some speculators rushed to cover their short positions. There was also some trading activity from customers, leading to consistently high asking prices across all contract months. However, manufacturers offered few supplies and remained cautious due to the lack of activity in spot foreign wheat. While current standards trended downwards, flour mills maintained a premium of 5 fen on existing flour stocks. This situation has persisted for the past three to four weeks with little change, representing a unique circumstance. Looking ahead, the key to price fluctuations lies entirely abroad, beyond the control of domestic conditions. Consequently, the current month's contract rose by 1 jiao 7 fen 5 li, August's by 2 fen 5 li, September and October's by 2 fen 2 xia-ban, November's by 2 fen, and December's by 1 fen 7 li 5 hao.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, the wheat futures market initially showed gains across all contract months but then declined. The current month's contract opened lower by 5 fen due to the heavy accumulation of spot wheat and consistently sluggish demand from mills. There were no subsequent trades. Distant months initially gained 1-2 fen, buoyed by the rising prices of foreign wheat, but later fell back by 2-3 fen due to the weakness in the current month's contract. In the afternoon session, there were no trades in the current month's contract, and distant contracts remained quiet and lifeless due to the abundance of spot wheat. Looking ahead, a sustained stabilization is only expected when foreign wheat activity ceases. Consequently, August and September contracts each fell by 1 fen, and the October contract fell by 2 fen. The spot wheat market, which had been inactive for several days, finally opened yesterday with prices for various grades of ship and railcar wheat falling by a substantial 1 jiao. Kaiwu wheat was priced at 3 yuan 3 jiao 2 fen, Liuhe wheat at 3 yuan 3 jiao 3-4 fen, Wuyi wheat at 3 yuan 2 jiao 9 fen, Jiangjiazhen Yangzhou wheat at 3 yuan 2 jiao 8 fen, Yaowan wheat at 3 yuan 3 jiao 3 fen, Puzhen wheat at 3 yuan 2 jiao 2 fen (and even down to 2 jiao), Nanjing and Hezhou wheat at 3 yuan 1 jiao 8 fen, Zhengyi wheat at 3 yuan 2 jiao 8-9 fen, and Yanghe wheat at 3 yuan 3 jiao 5 hao. Fuxin took 9,000 bags, and Xinda took 500 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Rice Prices Continue to Fall <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the supply of rice (South Shanghai) remained scarce, with only 7-8 boats arriving (totaling 15-16 hundred loads). While sales in the local market were sluggish, orders continued to come in from Tianjin, Weihaiwei, and other regions for 6-7 hundred bags of various premium japonica and thin indica rices, which were mostly settled. Only medium-grade rice continued to fall by over 1 jiao. There were reports of a significant turnaround in Zhabei yesterday afternoon, raising hopes for a similar improvement in the South Shanghai market today. Refined rice continued to depreciate, with no market for lower-grade rice. (21-22 boats from North Shanghai). The sales of various grades of rice were as follows: white japonica slightly improved, early rice with fixed prices saw some transactions, thin indica was flat with limited sales, and white rice slightly improved. The market price for white japonica fell another 1-2 jiao, thin indica fell by about 2 jiao, early rice fell by 3-4 jiao, and white rice fell by 2-3 jiao. Other grades of rice also showed weakness.</p>
<p>Sales of imported rice remained active, with more significant volumes going to regions along the Yangtze River, such as Jiujiang, Hankou, Shashi, as well as the Beiyang hinterland. However, transaction volumes were limited, failing to shift the market price trend. Furthermore, goods already fixed at favorable prices were still being loaded and shipped, and imported rice destined for Ningbo was also being diverted to Shanghai. With the hot weather, river wharves were under pressure to expedite deliveries, and trading houses were also lowering prices to stimulate sales, resulting in relatively active sales but a continued slight decline of about 1 jiao in market prices. The total volume released to the market was 7,000 bags of Saigon rice, 1,700 bags of Little Unity rice, and 600 bags of Siamese rice, distributed among various trading houses.</p>

<p>Excellent Quality, Poor Prices; Soybean Cake Weakens Further, Soybean Oil Rises Again</p>
<p>Yesterday, new soybeans from Wenzhou arrived on the market, totaling 45 bags. This was the first time that soybeans from that port had been transported to Shanghai for sale. It is said that this year's harvest in Wenzhou, regardless of size or maturity, was abundant. The quality of these soybeans is excellent, featuring small black-mouthed beans with a purity of over 80% and a bright color. The price opened at 3 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen, with scattered sales in the local market. However, it is said that the cost price of these soybeans is 4 yuan 1-2 jiao, so future arrivals are not expected to be numerous. Old soybeans remained difficult to sell in a sluggish market with weak prices. Soybean cake initially tightened but then weakened, while soybean oil was viewed favorably with strong demand, leading to market tightness and another increase of 2 jiao in price compared to the previous day.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of last month, green teas from Lu, Tu, and other regions have seen strong sales to European firms for both retail and wholesale due to their low prices. The market has remained stable for over a month, and prices have gradually rebounded by over 10 yuan after a significant drop at the opening of the season. However, in the past two days, a certain British firm, considering Chinese tea merchants' asking prices to be excessive, has become more cautious in its purchases of various grades of premium eyebrow green tea. Given its substantial sales volume, the market has become quieter as a result. However, current green tea inventories in the market are low, and the supply of raw tea from all regions is exhausted. The total green tea production volume is 30% lower than last year, so the market should remain stable.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Sugar Market Association settled 24 bags of coarse white granulated sugar at 15 yuan 9 jiao 5 fen per bag. Re-export goods were offered at 4 yuan 8 jiao. Taikoo sugar and locally produced refined cotton sugar remained stable with limited transactions. The supply of domestically produced refined cotton and red sugar increased slightly, leading to a weakening trend. Another 200+ bags were offered yesterday at a price of 10 yuan 0 jiao 8 fen, which was 2 jiao lower than the previous day. Some higher-priced goods seem unwilling to lower prices further.</p>

<h3 id="e197">Bedbug Night Talk <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>In my article "Seeing and Thinking," I mentioned that the superficial and confused thinking prevalent today is a mixture of Confucianism, Taoism, and Zen Buddhism, but I did not explain how this mixture came about. On a hot summer night, tormented by bedbugs, unable to sleep no matter how much I toss and turn, I decided to get up, turn on the electric light, and elaborate a little more.</p>
<p>It is likely that when Buddhism was introduced to China, Confucian scholars and Taoist believers alike looked down upon it. The main reason was that the Buddha was not of "Yellow descent"—and certainly not a descendant of Chi You. Since it was not a product of the Central Plains, it was inevitably a foreign religion and should not be promoted.</p>
<p>One person known to oppose Buddhism from a Confucian-Taoist standpoint is Han Yu. This is, of course, because he suffered greatly from it, making a name for himself in the process. However, his theories became well-known to later generations mainly because he was skilled in writing classical prose, which was considered "worthy of emulation" and widely circulated. In reality, by Han Yu's time, the mixture of Confucianism, Taoism, and Zen Buddhism had already transitioned from a formal to a psychological level, deeply rooted. The great success of the "Three Religions, One Source" theory is indicative of this.</p>
<p>Buddhism was able to gain prominence in China because it managed to capture the faith of several emperors. As for the reason it mixed with Confucianism and Taoism, I speculate that it was due to the advocacy of those ministers. Having read a few volumes of Confucian books, they never forgot that they were disciples of the sages, but they did not want to overtly defy the emperor's will. Therefore, they adopted a Confucian exterior with a Zen heart, neither monks nor laymen, creating the notion of "Three Religions, One Source" and "Buddhism and Confucianism are the same," which was essentially a self-deception. By the late Han and early Jin dynasties, Mouzi's *Treatise on Dispelling Confusion* and Sun Chuo's *Essay on Explaining the Way* both advocated the consistency of Buddhist and Confucian thought. *Essay on Explaining the Way* states:</p>
<p>"Zhou and Confucius are the Buddha, and the Buddha is Zhou and Confucius, merely different names for the inner and outer. ... Buddha, in Sanskrit, means 'awakened,' and in the Jin dynasty, it was interpreted as 'enlightened.' Meng Ke considered sages to be those who are first to awaken, and the meaning is the same. Zhou and Confucius rectified the evils of the time, while Buddhism only clarifies the root. They focus on the beginning and the end, but their ultimate goals are not different. Therefore, those who seek discord often see duality, while those who understand harmony find unity in everything."</p>
<p>From this, it is clear that the mixture of Buddhism and Confucianism was flawed and confused from the very beginning. The peacemaker's painstaking efforts are evident here.</p>
<p>Since the Jin Dynasty, due to the turbulent times, scholars and officials who had read the books of Confucius and Mencius became increasingly passive. As a result, the theory that "Buddha is Zhou and Confucius" further developed. Wearing Confucian robes and carrying prayer beads became fashionable. Some even held the *Classic of Filial Piety* in their left hand and the *Smaller Perfection of Wisdom Sutra* in their right hand at the moment of death, to show that they had no bias toward either.</p>
<p>However, there were indeed people who doubted that Buddhism and Confucianism were necessarily consistent. For example, Qiao Wang Shangzhi said in a letter to Zhang Xin'an:</p>
<p>"Buddhism speaks of karmic retribution as if it were an echo, and the words of the sages are clear and frightening. However, from the ancient emperors to King Wen, King Wu, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius, their decrees and instructions were all-encompassing, yet none of them described the three lifetimes or explicitly recounted karmic retribution. All the sages exhausted reason and fully understood their nature, illuminating the causes of things. Why would they bear to watch people drown without lending a hand, without even a single word to show them the path? Furthermore, they fished without nets, and their arrows did not target roosting birds. The finest and fattest were offered to God. From this perspective, it is difficult to understand..."</p>
<p>Later, Bo Yi of the Tang Dynasty also used the fact that "Buddhist teachings were not found in Chinese poetry and books" as a reason to reject Buddhism. Han Yu also said that the Buddha "does not speak the law of the former kings, does not wear the robes of the former kings, and does not know the righteousness of ruler and subject or the affection between father and son" as evidence that Buddhism and Confucianism were incompatible. However, despite the rejections, the idea that Buddhism and Confucianism were consistent still permeated everywhere. One can see in the notes of Tang and Song people that it was often recorded that a certain monk was a descendant of Wang Yishao or Xie Lingyun, proving that they had the potential to study. The prevailing trend at that time, although not to the point of removing one's Confucian hat to reveal a bald head, had already blended together in thought. Therefore, Song Confucian scholars rejected Buddhism but ended up "sitting on a Zen bed and cursing Zen," unknowingly influenced by its poison.</p>
<p>From the Yuan and Ming dynasties to modern times, although Buddhism seemed to have declined on the surface, in reality, Zen principles had infiltrated Confucianism and Taoism, and Buddhist teachings had permeated people's hearts. They had become one and the same, without leaving a trace. This is why those remnants of the old era, although having read Confucian classics and claiming to uphold tradition, mostly understand a little about Hinayana and Mahayana Buddhism. When unable to maneuver, they would quote profound principles and contemplate the emptiness of form, embracing a "live and let live" mentality, playing deaf and dumb, and drifting towards a confused death.</p>
<p>The Song Dynasty scholar Cheng Yi criticized the Buddhists, saying, "In the past, they deceived people by exploiting their ignorance, but now they deceive people by exploiting their intelligence." This is indeed true.</p>

<p>— By German author Storm, translated by Chen Yin Zhi</p>
<p>Already with her foot on the edge of the boat, about to step aboard, she suddenly hesitated and turned to look at us. Those distinctive, exotic black eyes, I had seen before, but not for a long time. Now, they met my gaze, and I knew it was Lenore Poligar. She had grown up, and a hint of unambiguous maidenly blush appeared beneath her brown cheeks. But she still retained that peculiar, graceful, indolent air, which had unknowingly fascinated my childish heart. My heart boiled with emotion, almost completely forgetting those ladies beside me. Those black eyes seemed to look at me with a pleading expression. I heard the old female tailor urging her, and the boatman prompting her to board the boat without elegant words, but this slender brown girl still stood motionless, as if in a dream, turning her eyes to me.</p>
<p>As if propelled by an inexplicable natural force, I had already taken a few steps towards that ferry boat, but I suppressed myself. I thought of Christopher. His honest blue eyes seemed to suddenly appear before me. "That boat cannot accommodate all of us," I said to the ladies. Then, we walked along the coast to another ferryboat from the side. ——But I still looked back at Lenore once. She lowered her head to her chest and slowly walked across the deck into the bottom of the boat, which lay on the calm water under the golden light of the setting sun.</p>
<p>On the return trip, I sat next to the rudder, not saying much, and feeling very uneasy. My eyes were always fixed on that ferryboat moving far ahead. Those young ladies tried to engage me in conversation, but they were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>"Why are you so useless today!" one of them said, "That pretty seamstress of ours seems to have taken your soul away!"</p>
<p>"Is Lenore your seamstress?" I asked, perplexed.</p>
<p>"Lenore! How do you know her name is Lenore?"</p>
<p>"I grew up in the same town as her. My first 'Mazurka' was danced with her in dancing school."</p>
<p>"So that's how it is!—So some people say she still likes to dance with university students now."</p>
<p>Our conversation about Lenore ended there. But now I understand why Christopher was unwilling to say much about Lenore.</p>
<p>Later in the winter, I saw him walking with Lenore in public places several times, often accompanied by the lame Mary, and sometimes by an even older woman. I guessed she was the aunt who inherited the estate, who took his beloved away not long before the poor French tailor died.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Infuriating! <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— By Long Gong Gong</p>
<p>One damp, chilly afternoon in early spring, I found myself painfully missing a distant friend. I wasn't sure if it was a flaw that this friend of mine knew how to sing the little song "The Merry Widow," but I urgently needed to hear it—that way, my memories would be clearer, and the separation between us would be shorter. So, I went to a movie theater to see a film with that song's name.</p>
<p>But there, I discovered something else.</p>
<p>Fumbling in the dark, talking loudly, two men and a woman came in. The woman was holding a small child, and the men were both wearing long gowns. I couldn't see their faces at all, but I sensed that they gave me a feeling of oppression. They were happy, comfortable, and free, as if they were sitting in their own living room.</p>
<p>The woman was in a very difficult situation. She tried various methods to quietly threaten and coax her child, trying to stop the constant noise. When her methods didn't work, she stood up and took the child outside to avoid the dissatisfaction of other audience members. She had to keep running in and out, so she was uneasy and busy.</p>
<p>The two men talked even more than their female companion, about doing business, watching the show, and the weather. Their conversations were short and quick, and they spoke so urgently that questions and answers seemed to come from the same person without interruption. There was no conflict, no difference of opinion. They first always said "good, good" to everything—based on this, I gradually imagined their faces and guessed that they were two small merchants.</p>
<p>"Is it better to watch a traditional opera or a movie...?"</p>
<p>"Quiet!" one person said like that, and the other person answered in the same way. The latter also offered an opinion:</p>
<p>"Is it better to watch a Chinese movie or a foreign movie...?"</p>
<p>"Refreshing!" The former also answered in the same tone.</p>
<p>They were talking very harmoniously, until Hebert was flirting with McDonald. This couple was sitting in a chair together, and Hebert was saying moving words of love to her. McDonald was then stimulated, her body uneasily moving in the seat, her face showing a confused, bewildered expression. For this matter, the two small merchants used regretful feelings and almost "pitying the fairer sex" to give their affirmative criticism:</p>
<p>"Infuriating!"</p>
<p>"Ah, infuriating!"</p>
<p>When a small businessman is shocked by his own talent, and is satisfied to find it, his vitality often develops to the highest limit, and reveals an astonishing obstinacy. In a few seconds, two college students next to them shouted at them to shut up, and they started arguing recklessly.</p>
<p>It was only at that time that I really felt very clearly that watching a movie was not an easy thing. Because of all kinds of restrictions and obstacles, it is difficult for people to understand each other, even face to face.</p>
<p>So, in the literary world, there have been cases of treating Laurel or Hardy as Chaplin, and saying all sorts of praises.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Agricultural Instructor <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— By Xu Ying</p>
<p>That evening, our "Farmers' Tea Garden" was exceptionally crowded. Ever since Zhou Huzi gave me a "nail" this morning, word spread like wildfire. Everyone who knew about it made time to come to the tea garden to listen to my "lecture."</p>
<p>At 6:45, I arrived at the tea garden. Hundreds of eyes immediately focused on me. Talking, laughing, singing, shouting—everything automatically stopped. There was unprecedented order. I calmly walked in, and they politely made way for me. As I took my seat, I glanced around. Zhou Huzi was grinning, his face full of glee. Chen Laosan was squeezed into another corner, gesturing and talking in a low voice.</p>
<p>With ten minutes to go before the lecture, I sat in my seat and waited, sipping the tea that the waiter brought me. The tea garden, inside and out, was filled with a tense atmosphere. The air was very solemn, like an arrow on a bowstring, the bow fully drawn. I stole glances around, carefully observing the expressions. Some who sympathized with me looked rather sad, while those who usually disapproved of me looked somewhat triumphant.</p>
<p>At 7:00, the waiter rang the iron bell, ding-dang, ding-dang. I stood up and first asked, "Is Village Chief Chen here?"</p>
<p>Chen Laosan, hurriedly responded, buttoning his long gown as he squeezed out of the crowd. With his small head and balding pate, and tall figure, he bowed and nodded repeatedly to me, quickly walking to the lecture table.</p>
<p>"Village Chief Chen," I said with a smile, "Today is like two parties in a lawsuit. Please act as a judge. Brother Zhou is probably here too, so please let Brother Zhou report first. I'll save my words for last."</p>
<p>"Good, good, good," Chen Laosan, said anxiously, sweat streaming from his head as he fanned himself frequently with his small folding fan. "Brother Shang, Brother Zhou, come, you go first..."</p>
<p>Zhou Huzi stood up, smiling, his beard spreading like a flower. I remained in my seat, sipping my tea and listening to his report.</p>
<p>He spoke with animated gestures, his voice booming.</p>
<p>"This morning, Mr. Li was watching the workers plow the fields. I went over and said, 'You don't deserve to be an agricultural instructor! You're not as good as the farmers, how can you instruct them?' 'I'll show you how it's done. Let's have a contest. You plow one row, and I'll plow one row. Whoever plows straighter, deeper, and faster, will be the instructor!' Later, I won. Mr. Li said he would give me the agricultural instructor's position tonight. Neighbors, please be witnesses. We farmers can show you we're not useless!"</p>
<p>Zhou Huzi's tone was somewhat aggressive and overbearing. After speaking, he clasped his fists and smiled, bowing to the crowd. Immediately, a roar of "Good!" erupted from the crowd. It was noisy.</p>
<p>Chen Laosan's demeanor seemed a bit more imposing. Smiling again at me, he said, "Please, Mr. Li!"</p>
<p>The words I had prepared in my belly were unusable in this situation. I had to use a sword to block a spear, and an egg can never break a stone. I had to harden myself.</p>
<p>I got up from the bench and stepped onto the table. I stood firmly, not speaking at first, but scanning the entire crowd. At that moment, the sun was setting, and the room was filled with a magnificent golden-red light. Then, the crowd quieted down. There was no sound.</p>
<p>"Brother Zhou," I said, "You truly have great skill. I know that Brother Zhou is not only good at plowing, but he's also excellent at planting rice. I truly admire you. But—"</p>
<p>I said loudly, shouting it all in one breath—</p>
<p>"Does an agricultural instructor only need to know how to plant rice? Brother Zhou's wheat planting is not so good! Does he recognize the tree species in this area? Even less so! He doesn't know how to grow vegetables, his silkworm raising is sloppy, and he doesn't understand how to open up mountains! Do you want an instructor who only knows how to plow a straight row? If we're talking about plowing a straight row, everyone here, which one of you isn't like Brother Zhou, which one of you isn't stronger than me? He can do it, can't you do it?</p>
<p>"Think about it, who should be the instructor, him or me? Please tell me!"</p>
<p>I scanned the crowd again. No one spoke. Zhou Huzi's face suddenly changed, and he glared at me. I said, "Brother Zhou, I'm sorry, I'll let you have it another day."</p>
<p>After I finished speaking, I left, followed by a clamor. I paid no more attention to what they were saying.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Mosquitoes <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>Of all the small insects that especially breed in summer and are most annoying, none are more so than flies, bedbugs, and mosquitoes. Mosquitoes, though not as dirty as flies or as insidious as bedbugs, when they gather together, make a noise like thunder, disturbing people's sweet dreams at night, which is even more annoying than flies and bedbugs. I remember in the "Jin Lou Zi," it was said, "Duke Huan of Qi slept in a cypress chamber and said to Zhongfu, 'The white birds are buzzing; they must be hungry. Open the green gauze window and let them in.'" The white birds are mosquitoes, which is said in the "Great Ritual," Xia Xiaozheng. Apparently, using gauze curtains to keep out mosquitoes has been around for a long time. Duke Huan of Qi discussed letting a swarm of hungry mosquitoes fly into the green gauze window. This can be considered the intention of a benevolent man, though it may seem a bit pedantic. I also remember that the great poet Fan Chengda of the Southern Song Dynasty had a short poem titled "Suffering from Mosquitoes":</p>
<p>"White birds buzzing, suffering from hunger at night, unable to bear the smoke driving them out of the window. Small insects share my worries, daring to fly tirelessly, driven by hunger."</p>
<p>This "Grand Councilor Prime Minister," "admired by all officials, famous throughout the world," actually cared about the hunger of mosquitoes, quite opposed to killing mosquitoes. He even said, "Small insects share my worries," seemingly having such broad sympathy as "treating all people as brothers and all things as companions." I once shamelessly stole the meaning of his poem. A young lady who had been in prison told me that she had written a eulogy for sparrows in prison because a sparrow flew into the prison, couldn't find a way out, and died after hitting the wall. I was very moved when I heard this, so I wrote a short poem for her and gave it to her. The poem says:</p>
<p>"Ashamed to lodge a branch in the deep forest, resolutely flying to the controlled land, brave and sad. I should share your worries; not worship Gaotao, but worship the sparrow!"</p>
<p>This young lady said that I had a bit of a humanitarian spirit, but in fact, I don't know what is called an -ism. It is said that some humanitarians must protect even small lives like bedbugs and mosquitoes, such as the "Protecting Life Paintings" by the famous cartoonist Feng Zikai, but they forget about people. I am not like that; I love to catch bedbugs, love to swat flies, and love to smoke out mosquitoes. If frogs and turtles were really delicious, and I could get used to eating them, and couldn't eat bird's nest and shark fins, and couldn't eat chicken, duck, fish, and meat, then taking frogs and turtles to make up for it wouldn't be considered cruel and unkind. When I was young, I was extremely thin, truly "too weak to bear the weight of my clothes." The doctor said I had anemia, so I hated bedbugs and mosquitoes that sucked my blood the most. I was born in the western countryside of Changsha, where the villagers hate bedbugs the most. If a family has bedbugs, it is as shameful as a man being a thief and a woman being a prostitute. After I entered the city, I was still afraid of saying that there were bedbugs on my bed, and catching bedbugs was a daily task, but I wrote "Liu Fei" (catching bedbugs) on the daily schedule. Once, someone who knew a little about philology spread my "Liu Fei" as a joke. As for mosquitoes, there are too many in the countryside. In the summer evenings, they buzz everywhere. Sometimes when breathing quickly, mosquitoes would get stuck in the nostrils. Sometimes when opening my mouth to speak, mosquitoes would break into my throat. There are fewer mosquitoes in the city, but compared to Shanghai, Changsha is considered the place with the most mosquitoes. I remember in the "Biographies of Empresses and Consorts" in the "History of the Southern Dynasties," it was said that Lady Ding, the concubine of Emperor Wu of Liang, when she was young, spun thread with the neighboring girls under the moonlight. Those girls were pitifully bitten by mosquitoes, but only the concubine didn't feel it. Perhaps the mosquitoes knew she was a noble person, so they didn't bite her! The same book, "Biographies of Honest Officials," says that Chu Sunqian "was honest and clean in the two counties and five prefectures he served from youth to old age. He lived frugally, using only rough mats and screens. In winter, he had cloth quilts and reed mats; in summer, he had no gauze curtains, but he never had mosquitoes and gnats biting him at night, which many people found strange." Mosquitoes also knew to reward honesty, which cannot but be said to be a strange thing. However, we must not be too naive and trust people too much. We must know that what historians record cannot all be taken as true, not just the matter of mosquitoes not biting honest officials!</p>

<h3 id="e202">Short-Term Training Class for Prostitutes <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>The newspaper recently reported a dispatch from Nanchang, saying: "The Popularization of Simple Education Association organized a short-term training class for prostitutes. The opening ceremony was held on the morning of the 13th. More than a hundred prostitutes attended, and each was given a copy of the 'Three Principles of the People Thousand-Character Text.' The instructors gave speeches, saying that they hoped that they would attend classes on time, and that they must know that without literacy, they would not understand etiquette and righteousness, and hoped that they would work hard to encourage themselves, etc."</p>
<p>Prostitution has become a superfluous thing accompanying modern society. Precisely because it is a "superfluous thing," the general public has mixed opinions about it. Many chapter-and-section regular customers spare no effort to waste words and ink, leaving their names under the flowers. In many places, businesses rely on this to maintain "market prosperity," and oppose the prohibition of prostitution. The authorities use "flower donations" as a source of government expenditure, making it difficult to act rashly. All of this is enough to show that this "superfluous thing" is not an easy problem to solve.</p>
<p>Recently, many people who are concerned about the world and people's hearts feel that prostitutes are things that mislead the common people and harm society. Therefore, there are "Movements to Eliminate Gambling and Prostitution" in various places. For a time, meetings were held, ribbons were cut, speeches were given, items were exhibited, bells were rung, and cannons were fired, which was quite a spectacle and very prosperous. Of course, this is "meritorious to society" and a good thing, and we raise our hands in support. If prostitution prevails, the trend of abduction will inevitably become widespread, trapping women in a miserable and dark life, which is the first crime. Countless people, young and old, indulge in licentiousness, wasting time and abandoning their careers, and their virtues decline day by day. In severe cases, they are disgraced, bankrupt, and lose their families, which is too numerous to list, which is the second crime. As for leading people to extravagance, and women's useful bodies competing to do "non-productive labor," which indirectly affects the country and society, it cannot but be said to be a pathological phenomenon. If this "movement" can "eliminate" it, it will be beneficial in every way, "for the country and for the people."</p>
<p>However, the problem is not so simple. The occurrence of prostitution is because many women have already lost the opportunity and skills to live. In the end, they have no choice but to sell their bodies. If you want to "eliminate" it, you must give them the opportunity and ability to live. I think the purpose of the Nanchang Popularization of Simple Education Association's opening of a short-term training class for prostitutes may also be here. Moreover, only in this way can the prostitutes trapped in misery and darkness benefit.</p>

<p>— You Qi</p>
<p>"We're leaving! Get up!"</p>
<p>The head porter shouted at the top of his lungs, from this end to that end, echoing a urging tune throughout this entire small town, in a chaotic manner.</p>
<p>This town isn't very big, sparsely populated with a hundred or so households. The entire journey from the east end to the west end of this long street can be completed in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Just this one heart-piercing crossroad, with two small paths leading to the fields. The street isn't wide, but it can accommodate a sedan chair carried by four people. As for the houses? Some are high, some are low. Tiled houses are rare. Of course, one cannot be too demanding in terms of architecture. The houses are so dark, emitting the smell of pig grease and dampness.</p>
<p>"Still not up? We're leaving!" The head porter, panting, shouted again.</p>
<p>The people living in the town are accustomed to getting up early. Strangers, attacking them, surrounding them, watching, pointing. Perhaps it's not common for our large group of travelers to pass through their town, I thought.</p>
<p>"Xiao Liu, Li Tou, get the poles, tie them up quickly, and leave first." The third porter also rushed over, giving such instructions, with blue veins popping on his forehead.</p>
<p>Hemp ropes, carrying poles, in a hurried mess, talking, with the mist covering this quiet field, on their faces, there was the weariness of being not yet awake.</p>
<p>"Is it ready? Brother Xiao Liu, let's go, take a couple of puffs first, never mind!"</p>
<p>"Let's not go, that's three hundred cash! I haven't had breakfast yet!"</p>
<p>"Not smoking? Then how will you be able to carry anything later!"</p>
<p>The situation flashed through Xiao Liu's mind a few times. Finally, he didn't say anything else, and followed him into a thatched house with a lantern hanging at the door.</p>
<p>"Half swallowing, half spitting, the taste is short; one inhale, one exhale, the smoke meaning is long."</p>
<p>A pair of red paper couplets was pasted on the rafters of the thatched hut. Perhaps the days had been too long, and the color had been stripped away, turning into a scorched yellow.</p>
<p>"The sun has climbed onto the hillside, and you're still not leaving, you bunch of turtles!"</p>
<p>The head porter was really angry, sweat flowing profusely, his face flushed red, and his already hoarse throat entered a deeper stage after several frantic shouts.</p>
<p>No matter how hot the weather, here, headscarves cannot be avoided. Because of his anxiety, he finally removed the headscarf from his head, and the heat was steaming like a pot on his head. Really, he couldn't shirk the responsibility of urging them, because the porters deliberately delayed at this daily determined station.</p>
<p>The bright red sun, so delicate, fell from the edge of the hillside into the low, small window, reflecting a little brilliance in the darkness. This was telling us that it was already late, and we all got up one by one, preparing to set off.</p>
<p>"Third porter, how many have left ahead?" Tie asked, brushing his teeth.</p>
<p>"Ten loads of luggage, eight flower basket poles, seventeen shoulder poles, and some are still tying up, the sedan chairs and sliding chairs are also ready." He smiled, the sun taking away its previous bright red, secretly looking at his purple-black face.</p>
<p>"Come on, get ready to go, let's have breakfast at Datianba." Porter Zhang shouted back and forth.</p>
<p>"Datianba, how far is it?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Cross the mountain peak of the watershed ahead, and it's another six li."</p>
<p>A group of people, noisy and disorderly, left the simple little town after a period of extreme commotion, and began to travel on the sheep-intestine-like mountain path.</p>
<p>Around them, so solemn, the waterfall flows so crisp, the secluded valley is so deep, the hillside, green, the flowing clouds, misty, farmers' songs, birds' songs, this melodious sound wave, showing the softness of the mountains.</p>
<p>The porters were accustomed to using jargon, answering each other in their jargon about how to avoid things.</p>
<p>"Green canopy sweeps the top, ah! (referring to mountain trees branches sweeping the head)"</p>
<p>"Raise the carrying pole over the ridge, ah!"</p>
<p>"Green grass flowers ahead, ah! (referring to horse manure)"</p>
<p>"A puddle of thin cba cha yo!"</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>In the long mountain path, the porters echoed vigilantly.</p>

<p>— Ji</p>
<p>It is already the height of summer: In the morning, a thick golden cloud floats on the horizon. A few birds sparsely make a couple of leisurely calls. This tone strikes into the nearly-awakened dream of people, like the sorrow of the strings on a dulcimer beyond the distant Guanshan mountains. It is so easy for people to recall the desolate circumstances beyond the border, and then, how quickly, to think of the flourishing big trees on the flower-like land of the South; On the branches perch many unknown birds, quietly using their pointed beaks to preen their feathers after waking up, occasionally chirping a couple of times, trying to use sounds similar to strings to narrate the poems of the joys and partings of last night's dreams ah.</p>
<p>Then, someone lightly marked a red line in the sky above the horizon near the clouds. This is to foretell what a good day this entire day will be! Thus: In an instant, streams of light like red gold bloomed at the mark of the scarlet line. This light, shining on the blue sky, from near to far, soon turned the vast sky into a bright mirror.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>Thus, over there, at the end of the horizon, on the distant eastern deserted beach, a fiery sun leaped up, followed by the entire earth also becoming warm from cool, from warm to slightly cooked, and from slightly cooked to boiling.</p>
<p>A new day has begun, a summer day ah.</p>
<p>The heat is ceaselessly strengthening, scorching the earth, urging its growth and progress. Afterwards, let the abundant autumn come as a reward for the effort of growth. But, even so, how much suffering must the creatures galloping on this baking land have! The sun has begun its post on the inspector's position. In the countryside, the farmers, men and women, and children, with half-full stomachs, a pair of tired eyes, and a feeling of weariness and resentment towards life itself; hunched over, pouting, resentfully heading towards the fields. There, they will use their sweat to moisten these broad, hard, dry, stubborn and ruthless lands, organizing them piece by piece, turning them over and harrowing them. Every year, they must first use the money and labor of their own children to guarantee the harvest of this year; But in these days, as known from past facts: these dry, stubborn and ruthless clods of earth are such a vague and unreliable kind of lender ah. In this fire-scorched summer, people cannot help but ask: Sweat is dripping onto the ground drop by drop, but where is the reward for this labor, and what can be used to guarantee it?</p>
<p>In the small towns, after the Dragon Boat Festival, in the heart of summer, it is precisely the busy farming season. The shops and teahouses are all in a period of "clearing out." The streets are sparse. The shopkeepers open their doors, only staring blankly at the empty streets. The sun shines, and the eternally uneven cobblestone road already seems to be boiling with fire. The shop assistants are idle, dozing off on the counters in twos and threes, and some lean half their bodies and chat with the familiar "bachelors" on the street. The teahouse is equally deserted. Apart from a few "old gentlemen" from the city, few people come to town to buy a pot of tea or sit for a while to chat with someone. Summer is an exciting season. After the sun has boiled the earth, it also stirs up the entire biological world. People, along with other animals, abandon everything in this season most suitable for growth and become busy, letting the birds call and letting the wind blow. It is necessary to put aside comfort and save it for the future, flowing with the sweat of labor. At this time, leisure is inappropriate, and laziness is inappropriate; Summer requires people to labor, to sweat, and not to lie on a bamboo couch and have people bring "plums and watermelons" ah.</p>
<h3 id="e205">George Bernard Shaw Advocates Interracial Marriage between Blacks and Whites <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Te</p>
<p>Aren't black people generally regarded by many as an inferior race in the world? But things are unexpected, and the world-renowned British writer George Bernard Shaw, recently returned from a trip to South Africa, actually advocates interracial marriage between black and white residents in Africa. According to his opinion, only this method can the white people of South Africa solve the important problems on which their survival depends. Shaw also explained that black people are by no means an inferior race. Shaw's ability to eliminate ethnic boundaries and break class concepts is certainly worthy of admiration. But what Shaw is doing is still for the survival of the white people of South Africa. After the white race breeds, where is there room for the black race to survive? Shaw also said that Africa ultimately belongs to the African people, not to many competing powers, which is a very vague view. Once the land is occupied by a different race, it is more difficult to restore it than climbing to heaven. Moreover, the same race always protects the white race, as we can see in the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia now. The Abyssinian government recently sent a telegram to the US government, applying for the invocation of the Kellogg-Briand Pact to prevent Italy from starting a war. The US replied with empty words, and recently six countries, France, Britain, Belgium, Czech Republic, Sweden, and Denmark, banned the transportation of military supplies to Abyssinia. If the war between Italy and Abyssinia breaks out, Abyssinia's armaments, not only can't match Italy's rice, but also have no rear supply, then defeat is inevitable. But although Italy intends to use the power of thunder to add to Abyssinia, Abyssinia has never shown a sign of surrender. Shaw's statement that black people are not an inferior race is certainly justified. People with this kind of spirit will never perish in the world.</p>
<p>A few hours after Shaw returned to London from South Africa, he spoke to a reporter from the Daily Telegraph who came to interview him about what he considered a serious matter. He was greatly impressed by the very good climate of South Africa. But what caused the danger was that terrible sunlight.</p>
<p>"The problem," he said, "is whether white people can survive in these places, and now it is gradually becoming serious. I am not saying that you will die because you are not acclimatized; you will not die. The problem is whether your descendants can be born in South Africa. When I was in South Africa, I encountered a rather surprising thing, which was that the railway tycoon Bill Row pleaded with white people to immigrate to South Africa and maintain the white population there. What does that mean? The public sees that the white race in America is very rich, and thinks it is not difficult to fill South Africa with white people, but South Africa will not be filled. This is not a birth control problem, because many people in South Africa are very willing to have children, but they cannot make them grow up. I think this may be because the sunlight in South Africa is too strong and not suitable for people with white skin. The remedy is probably only to make the skin black. That is to say, the white people in South Africa may as well marry black women."</p>
<p>"Wouldn't your old ideal provoke the hatred of white people?" the reporter asked:</p>
<p>"That's right," Shaw replied, "but there are already many mixed races in the world now. I heard smart people in Hawaii say that the natives of the South Pacific islands are gradually disappearing. Purebred people rarely remain. Mixing the two colors in South Africa may solve the problem. It must be known that this is not a black and white problem. The first thing to know is that there is no such thing as a white race on the face of the earth. The Chinese call us red-haired people, which is correct. The Zulu people of Africa are indeed a noble race. In the past, many people tried to bring them down to an inferior position, but the result was always failure, because they are not an inferior race. If you see them working, you will definitely want British workers to work like them."</p>
<p>Shaw also thought that this problem was not limited to South Africa, but could also be extended to a large part of the African continent.</p>
<p>Shaw continued: "I often say that the old German colonies should be returned to Germany, and Mussolini is also trying to extend his hand to Abyssinia. Although you can now divide Africa among the European powers, one day the African people will say to you, 'None of you are allowed to occupy the land of Africa'! At that time, the people of Africa, whether they are natives, white people, black people, or whatever, will see that Africa ultimately belongs to the African people, not to many competing European powers. Bloodlines can be mixed, but the natives of Africa have their special abilities, and in the long run, we can see that only they have the ability to survive in Africa, and no one else does.</p>

<p>Opening "Autumn Boudoir Complaint"</p>
<p>A bolt from the blue is thought-provoking. What is the reason for the resentment that secretly hurts people? I want to turn comfort into music. Be content, abide by the rules, and be thrifty. Last night, a letter came. Therefore, I bid farewell and hurriedly returned home. Mother's words were heartbreaking. Although it is not a fact, it is difficult to argue. I have never been to willow lanes and flower streets. Not to mention resting girls selling art. I am a dignified scholar from a family in Xixi. How could I lose my innocence and learn to be modern? My family is poor and I read little. I was only thirteen years old to make a living. It is a pity that what I learned is an outside job. I am not able to do much because I have little ink in my chest. I am grateful to the elders for their praise. Broadcasting on wireless electricity in middle school. In a blink of an eye, a year has passed. Benefit public and private, and there is no blame. I only wish that I, will prosper and progress day by day. On that day, I can start a business and accomplish things. Who knows the storm will rise on the flat ground. It has taught me to be ashamed of my family. What do you say, the wind doesn't rise. The waves don't rise. What do you say, the shrimp don't jump. The water doesn't move. I am, this life is difficult to understand the injustice. I am willing to throw myself into the Pu River and become a water minister. But I have not repaid, my parents' nurturing grace.</p>

<p>Karl Bretson, the king of the singing world, stars in "Hearts in Harmony," Two Hearts in Waltz Time, a musical romance. Its story describes a infatuated composer pursuing a female lead in his new work. Although the woman also loves him, her attitude is always aloof and indifferent, expressing nothing. The composer leaves in anger. At this time, the premiere date of the new play is approaching, and the important scores have not been written yet, but he doesn't care, making the director jump with anxiety. In order to take care of the overall situation, the female lead has no choice but to chase after him to explain everything. Unexpectedly, the woman mistakes the composer's sister for his lover, and a wave of love rises again in the sea of love. But in the end, all misunderstandings are fortunately resolved, and the two reconcile as before. In this work, Karl Bretson not only has several new songs such as "Hearts in Harmony," "Vienna Scenery," and "Give It a Light Kiss" that are sung very movingly, but also performs extremely divinely. Especially his dance skills can be called excellent. It is heard that the film will soon be released at the Cathay Grand Theatre.</p>

<h3 id="e214">Renault Cars Cause a Sensation in Shanghai <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Three Wonderful Styles to Suit All Needs</p>
<p>The amazing progress in the automotive industry in the past two years can be seen in the 1935 Renault cars. Whether it is the application of the principle of aircraft aerodynamics to the car body and structure, or the engine construction that meets the principle of economy everywhere, Renault is the most worthy of praise. The various advancements that Renault has in all aspects are too numerous to mention, but its price has not increased at all, and its internal spaciousness and comfort have not been diminished. This is especially commendable and is truly a major success in mechanical engineering.</p>
<p>The new Renault cars have three groups in total. The beauty of their paint and the magnificence of their appearance have caused a sensation in Shanghai and are the vehicles that people in the automotive industry unanimously admire. The new cars have a complete range of styles, which can be used for all purposes, whether it is for office, sports, or family, and they are extremely pleasant and competent. The appearance of the new cars is extremely beautiful and moving, but their content is excellent and outstanding. Renault has always been known for its magnificent performance, and this is why Renault car owners have always been extremely satisfied. Now, the car not only maintains these advantages, but also promotes them even more.</p>
<p>Among the various styles of Renault, the Vivas Stella sports style is the most attractive. Its construction is based on actual aircraft testing, so it can definitely meet the principle of aircraft aerodynamics. Its stored power, beautiful and magnificent appearance, and unattainable speed are the characteristics that first give people a deep impression. As for its internal position, it is more spacious, and the paint decoration is extremely beautiful. This new car has three styles: convertible coupe, two-door sedan, and enlarged van. The van has five seats, which are extremely comfortable. In addition, the Vivas Stella family van has two types: five-seater and seven-seater. The front and rear seats are spacious and can be stretched at will. The seven-seater is equipped with six windows, all equipped with a windless ventilation system. Another style is a sports car with a sporty appearance. Its performance is almost the same as that of the large sports style, but its consumption is more economical. For those who want to drive quickly in the city, this vehicle is especially suitable because of its unusually sensitive acceleration rate and extremely easy handling, which is especially suitable for the vehicle traffic conditions in this city. The parking space it occupies is smaller than usual. The car body is particularly beautiful and magnificent. According to this new type of Renault car, one of its most significant advances is the automatic starter and the new carburetor. The reason why the new car can be started immediately in any weather is that it has this new equipment. The Renault engine adopts a special suspension method, so it can ensure that no slight vibration occurs. As for the wheels, they are extremely easy to replace without any effort. The spare wheel is placed in a concealed place, and the position is just right, so it does not hinder the streamline shape of the entire car at all. Furthermore, if the general car owners also consider others, they will definitely praise another equipment of Renault. According to this equipment, there is nothing else, that is, the rear direction indicator that allows vehicles behind to see the direction of the car.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Types and Descriptions of Car Brakes and Brakes <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Zhenmin</p>
<p>The main components that control every car are the brakes and the brakes. If the car does not have a brake device, then the car cannot run. If the car does not have a brake device, then the car will keep running and cause various damages. These two machines are indispensable. In recent years, there has been an increasing trend in the improvement of automobile engineering and manufacturing, especially in the improvement of brakes and brakes, which has increased the braking efficiency to more than 90%. Therefore, the new modern cars only need very little force to trigger the engine to run, or to suddenly stop the high-speed engine in a few seconds. These are all very obvious examples.</p>
<p>There are many types of brakes and brakes, especially because of the prosperity of electricity in recent years. New machines are constantly being introduced, while old brakes or brakes are constantly being eliminated. Now, the most important types are listed below.</p>
<p>A. Braking Machines</p>
<p>(1) Heat Pipe Brake The earliest brake used. It uses external heat—usually gas media—to increase the temperature of the compressed air in the cylinder to the combustion point. Finally, an explosion occurs in the cylinder, causing the piston to push the crank, and then push the propeller to make the car body move forward. Although the ignition of this system is stable, the explosion time in the cylinder is not fixed. This is a very big shortcoming, and it also requires a large amount of combustion gas for ignition. This is enough to increase the price of fuel, so new cars rarely use this braking system now.</p>
<p>(2) Natural Combustion Ignition Brake This brake does not use external heat to increase the temperature of the gas in the cylinder. It completely uses the volume compression of the gas mixture to increase the temperature to the combustion point, causing the gas in the cylinder to explode to push the piston. This gas mixture is limited to a certain medium-sized oil mixed with air. Highly volatile oils, such as gasoline, etc., cannot be used. Therefore, only 1 or 2 percent of cars now use this brake.</p>
<p>(3) Electric Brake 95 out of every 100 cars now use electric brakes. Because this brake has extremely high efficiency and the time is very fast. It can push the car body in two or three seconds, which is really unmatched by any brake. Their functions all use the principle of induction electricity and appropriate machinery. They can also be divided into the following two types. A, Switch System (—Make-ander-Bak System)—This system is the most widely used. It uses the induction effect of the first and second coils to generate induction current. The first coil is equipped with a switch, which uses a cam and electromagnetic action to connect and disconnect the switch from time to time. As a result, an induced voltage is generated in the coil, causing sparks between the poles. The occurrence of this spark is inside the cylinder, so the temperature of the gasoline and air mixture in the cylinder is increased to a considerable extent, causing an explosion, which pushes the piston and makes the car body move forward. The speed and sensitivity of this braking are really unforeseen by any engineer. B, Jump-Spark System—The difference between this system and the previous one lies in the arrangement of the electrodes and the level of the voltage. The electrodes in method (A) are movable and the voltage is also very low. The current system is just the opposite. There are two fixed electrodes in the cylinder, with a small gap between them, and the rotation of the cam is used to suddenly increase the induced electricity in the coil. As a result, high-voltage sparks occur between the two poles, jumping into the gap and suddenly increasing the temperature of the gas in the cylinder, and the volume increases accordingly, causing the piston to move forward and the wheels to rotate. Because the voltage of this system is very high, capacitors are often installed to prevent excessive voltage and prevent the danger of short circuits. Although the two methods (A) and (B) are roughly similar, method (A) is much simpler than method (B) and there is no short circuit or other phenomena. Therefore, method (A) is used in most new cars now. Now that we have explained the brake in detail, we will now analyze the general types of brakes as follows.</p>
<p>B Mechanism Braking Machines</p>
<p>(1) Mechanical Motor Mechanical braking is the simplest. It uses the leverage effect to make the "brake shoe" (brake shoe is usually made of rubber or steel) tightly attached to the rear wheel. Due to the friction force, the rear wheel is stopped from moving forward. The biggest benefit of this system is that it is simple and easy to repair. However, steel or iron brake shoes are prone to rust, which makes the braking force unbalanced and loses its efficiency. Therefore, it is rarely used on new cars.</p>
<p>(2) Hydraulic Brake It uses the distribution of hydraulic force to brake the wheels. Usually, two connected vertical cylinders (with a large and a small cross-sectional area) are used instead of levers. The cylinder is filled with water or light oil. When braking, you only need to lightly step on the footboard to make the brake shoe connected to the large cylinder tightly attached to the wheel, so that the car body stops moving forward. The braking efficiency produced by this method is ten times that of the first method. However, the biggest drawback is that the cylinder is very prone to leakage. Not only does the efficiency disappear, but repairs are also difficult. It is more widely used than method (1).</p>
<p>(3) Air Brake The structure of this brake is exactly the same as that of the hydraulic brake. The only difference is that the cylinder is filled with air. This can avoid the danger of leakage. Before the air is used for braking, it is first compressed by a motor and stored in a cylinder. When applied, the valve can be opened, and the high-pressure air rushes into another cylinder, so that the "brake shoe" is tightly attached to the wheel and the car body stops moving forward. This compressed air can be continuously transported by a small motor. When the brake is not in use, the small motor can automatically stop. This method is much more advanced than the previous two methods. Therefore, 60% of cars now use this brake.</p>
<p>(4) Electromagnetic Brake Like the brake, it also uses the induction electricity of the coil for braking. Its structure is quite simple. A fixed joint is installed on the main rotating shaft of the engine and rotates with the shaft. Another joint is tightly connected to the center of the induction coil with a small shaft. This induction coil is connected to a battery. When braking, you only need to turn on the circuit, and induction electricity will be generated in the coil, which will generate magnetic force. This will cause the small shaft of the joint to move forward. The two joints will automatically mesh, and the rotating shaft will stop running. Although this brake is not as efficient as the air brake, it is widely used now because of its simple structure.</p>
<p>Overall, although there are many types of brakes and brakes mentioned above, it is very obvious that electric power is gradually being used on cars to obtain highly efficient braking.</p>

<p>Recently, Mr. Di Yuliang broke the record for the car race between Saigon and Hanoi again. The road between the two places is 1,732 kilometers long. It only took 19 hours and 59 minutes to arrive. The speed is equivalent to 86.6 kilometers or 53.7 miles per hour. Mr. Di Yuliang's previous record was 23 hours and 15 minutes. The record has been broken six times in the past few years, and five of them were broken by Ford cars. Mr. Di's engine cover was sealed this time, which makes it even more commendable. On the same day, Mr. Tao Nier also broke the previous record in 20 hours and 44 minutes. However, Mr. Di Yuliang started later and was able to beat Mr. Tao by a faster time of 45 minutes. However, Mr. Tao was still full of energy when he arrived at the finish line and said that if the car had not been delayed by trains and ferries, it would not have been difficult to achieve the same good time as Mr. Di.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Ten Horsepower Four-Cylinder Marius Encounters Danger in South Africa <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>The Connock Automobile Company in South Africa recently received a letter from Mrs. Davis, the owner of a Marius car there, describing the dangers she encountered in South Africa and praising the sturdiness and beauty of the Marius car, which made her very satisfied. Now, the letter is translated as follows to inform the general public who are concerned about Marius cars.</p>
<p>"You may be honored to know about the small dangers we encountered on our way back to Babbotang. When we were driving about 30 miles and approaching Carolina, we saw three or five natives wandering in the road. The time was 9:30 in the evening, and it was already late at night. However, because we were riding in a ten-horsepower four-cylinder Marius, the excellence of its car lights is well known to you. Therefore, although it was pitch black all around at that time, we could see the natives very clearly from the car. As the car moved forward and got closer to the natives, they all jumped to the side of the car and shot. The bullets hit the front door of my car, but fortunately they did not penetrate. However, my knee was right in the center of the car door, and the car door was suddenly shaken by the bullets. My knee was also injured as a result. At that time, the sound of gunfire was like a string of beads, and we had no weapons, so we dared not stop. We still sped away. After we got out of the encirclement, we checked the place where the car was shot. The dents were deep enough to fit a finger, and the steel skin was peeling off. The power of the bullet can be imagined. If we were riding in the old car before, it can be said that the bullets would have pierced my knee. Now, because Marius is made of strong and solid high-quality materials, we were able to avoid this disaster. It is really a great fortune. In addition to the above-mentioned unfortunate incident, my ten-horsepower four-cylinder Marius has been used for more than a year. I have driven it in various weathers and on various rugged and bad roads. The good results have made me overjoyed and extremely satisfied. As for climbing mountains, its agility, ease of use, and its ability to stay cool are all outstanding and unmatched. In addition to my joy, I specially write to inform you."</p>

<h3 id="e218">Tires Still Intact After Being Submerged in Water for More Than Ten Years <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>A car that had been submerged in the Hudson River near New York City in the United States for more than ten years was recently salvaged. It was found that all four wheels were equipped with Goodyear rubber tires. The tires still contained air. The spokes were almost completely rusted, but the tires were still in good condition, and it seemed that they could still be used for driving. According to the product records of Goodyear Company, these four tires were made in 1921.</p>
