<h3>國聯史上創舉　行政一致表决　意國違約開釁　　兩委員會報告書均已通過　行政院現仍準備贊助講和　今日大會討論制裁辦法</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯行政院今日一致裁判結果、意國在道德上已被擯於文明國之林、而被宣布違背至莊嚴之條約，從事干戈矣、國聯其他會員國卒允與任何破壞國聯盟約國斷絕一切商業上與財政上之關係、及禁止一切交際，今日行政院開會、當主席向各理事詢問是否贊同以此狀態申討意大利時、衆皆一一答曰贊同、會塲景狀、至爲動人、意總代表阿洛錫在會議之始終、憂形於色一望可知、迨表決旣定、乃輕彈其紙烟、向法總理勒伐爾作一滑稽語、面露笑容、此誠爲勇敢失敗者之一笑也、國聯行政院决議實施盟約第十六條、而以此對付劍造國聯之一份子、實爲國聯成立以來之第一次，今第二步驟、將由國聯大會進行之、大會定明日開會、將贊同行政院之决議、並將組成委員會、辦理實施制裁所必要之經濟計書、委員會第一任務、爲製定經濟制裁方案、其中大約將包括斷絕外交而非領事關係、及取銷禁止軍火運往阿國之命令、封鎖問題、不致立卽發生、惟較溫和之計畫如行之無效、則必考慮該問題、此可無疑者也、行政院並曾通過十三國委員會之報吿書、僅意代表投反對票王席繼稱、今第一必要之事、厥爲停止戰事、行政院今仍聽輔助意阿商妥任何可能的和平解决方法之諸方面之指揮、進行一切云、行政院今日除通過十三國委員會之報吿書外、並通過六國委員會之報吿書、其中指意國爲此次戰爭之侵略者、並責其違背國聯盟約、阿洛錫曾致詞反對此報吿書並保留稍緩提出意見之權、迨表决旣定、主席卽莊嚴宣布國聯十四會員已投票决定不顧盟約第十二條條文之戰爭狀態現已存在、各會員今須考慮履行盟約第十六條規定制裁者所列之義務彼等欲盡會員之責、决不能蔑視此種義務、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯行政院以十三對一之票數確認意大利爲東菲戰爭中之戎首、並通過對意制裁案、僅意國投票反對、惟根據國聯盟約、爭議一造之反對票不足變更决議案、故援引制裁之决議在技術上可謂已經一致通過、行政院確認意軍開釁、直接破壞盟約第十二條行政院之决議自動援用盟約第十六條、制裁辦法將於星期三國聯大會通過行政院報吿時决定、並將組織一委員會、研究該問題之法律部份、此間若干觀察者咸信、美國或將被邀派遣旁觀員參加該委員會、現堪注意者、行政院之决議、雖僅約束十三國、但事實上國聯各會員國在大會中可望宣布同樣之决議、（七日國民電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）據此間可靠消息、對意制裁將以一九二一年十月國聯大會袂議案中所載之原則爲依據、此項議案規定（一）斷絕外交關係、但領事關係則不在其例、（二）限制郵寄鐵路及其他交通、（三）經濟制裁、如限制軍用原料對意輸出、及限制意貨淮口事、聞上述辦法如不能約束意國、則國聯將考慮由各國共同辦理或由一二國在國聯命令下之封鎖問題、不過封銷一舉必至萬不得已時始施用之、（八日路透電）</p>
<h3>阿比西尼亞　囑意使立即出境</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）阿代表哈華利今日通知國聯、謂阿政府已囑意使立卽出境、因阿京意使署乃間諜與陰謀之集中所、使署人員有破壞阿國公安陰謀也、（八日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）意國政府因該國駐阿國使領館人員現已無法居留阿國、曾向比國政府探詢、能否由比國駐阿國使館人員、代爲担任外交事務、比國政府聞已答復意國、謂在與英法兩國同意之前、未能照辦、意國政府爰乃請由英法兩國政府轉商比國駐英大使、或英國駐比大使、向比國政府說項云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>國聯行政院　重要會議詳情　意方欲展期開會未成　阿代表宣佈抵抗到底</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯行政院於本日午後開會、會議歷時未及二小時而畢、此不僅為國聯會成立以來最重要之决議、且就其曾議進行之過程、實亦打破國聯會工作之速度紀錄、茲記其經過如次、</p>
<p>本日午後一時五十分、國關會秘書處發表六國委員會提出行政院之報吿書、其結論、斷定「意大利違反國聯會盟約第十二條、從事戰爭」、至下午四時三十分、意大利代表阿洛亞西向行政院要求將該報吿書延緩公開討論、行政院乃於四時四十五分召集非公開會議、除意國代表外行政院各會員國一律出席、當經決定行政院拒絕意國代表之要求、仍照原定程序、卽行討論六國委員會之報告書、決定意大利之戰爭責任、</p>
<p>至下午五點四十五分、行政院乃於緊張空氣中、舉行公開會議、行政院全體會員國連同意阿雙方代表、悉出席會議、由阿根廷代表格那齊主席、最初由意國代表阿洛亞西發言、對於六國委員會報告書、作冗長之批評、略謂意國政府對於該報吿書、不得不提出最强有力之保留、計分數點如下、（一）以意大利對阿比西尼亞之立塲、與其他國家對阿國之立塲、互相比較、實屬完全忽略事實情形、蓋按諸事實、阿國之侵略精神、繼續不輟、乃特別係對意國而發、使意不得不採取自衛之措置、（二）報吿書雖明白承認阿國地方當局幷未實施阿皇所决定之各項改革事宜、換言之、卽承認阿國內部缺乏組織、然對於意國備忘錄中所提出之意見、則仍未視爲妥善、（三）六國委員會報吿書、拒絕對於阿國奴隸問題作澈底之研究、但就實際情形、則阿國奴隸制度之存在、乃爲一般人所共同承認、若然、則不啻承認違反人道與正義基本原則之狀態、應准許其繼續存在、此當由六國委員會負其責任、（四）報吿書指摘意火利遲至九月四日始行提川備忘錄、實則在九月四日以前、意國正待華爾華爾　件之仲裁結果、故未正式提出譴責阿國之文件、至於意國迭次派遣軍隊赴東菲洲、係因阿國方面軍事行動漸臻嚴重之所致、且意國軍事準備、係公開爲之、所有意國軍隊　過蘇彝士運河時、均係經蘇彝士運河當局査核者也、阿洛亞西最後結論、則謂『今如根據各種抽象原則、置阿比西尼亞於文明國家之列、則一切討論、均屬徒勞而無益』云、</p>
<p>繼由阿比西尼亞代表哈華里德發言、略謂阿國完全同意十三國委員會之報吿書、阿國茲再保證、阿國準備考慮行政院所提出之建議、又謂華爾華爾事件仲裁委員會、曾判定阿國並無何種責任、且意國迭次以軍火秘密運入阿國各地、企圖鼓動阿國內亂、今六國委員會報吿書、宣佈意國負戰爭責任、阿國認爲完全滿意、『蓋戰爭足使意大利與阿國同受其禍害、然戰禍不能戢止、阿國必抵抗到底』云、至是六國委員會主席葡萄牙代表孟德祿起立用法文宣讀六國委員會報吿書之結論、謂『六國委員會研究結果、認爲意大利已違反國聯會盟約第十二條所規定之約束而從事戰爭』云、於是主席格那齊乃請行政院各會員國及關係兩造代表、將六國委員會報告書、再行加以審閱一過、意國代表阿洛亞西復起言、對於行政院未能允許意國要求、延緩討論報吿書之一事、表示抗議、阿國代表哈華里德則聲言聽候行政院决定一切、最後主席格那齊答覆阿洛亞西、謂『今日係十月七日、意阿發生敵對狀態、已歷時五日、行政院如再行遷延不决、當負事變擴大之責、但關係兩造倘有意見、以致行政院開會時、仍可提出討論』云、於是主席宣佈唱名表决、六國委員會報吿書乃經行政院全體一致通過、報吿書通過以後、主席卽官稱『出席行政院十四國代表業已同意、戰爭現已開始盟約第十二條已遭違犯、故本日所通過之六國委員會報吿書及行政院會議紀錄、應分送國聯會全體會員國核閱、按照盟約第十六條規定倘一國從事戰爭、全體會員國　負有某種義務、爲此應由國聯大會指派委員會、以謀調整按照盟約第十六條所採取之各項措置、國聯大會現定本星期三日召集開會』云主席語至此、全塲靜寂無聲、空氣異常嚴肅、行政院遂于午後七點三十分散會、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>國聯秘書處　佈置大會程序　以十六條修正案為根據</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯會大會定於明日午後開會、主席爲捷克外長皮宜士、秘書處今晨已代大會擬定議程、及制裁方案委員會人選、此項委員會當由準備執行制裁各會員國代表組織成之、其他反對制裁各會員國、則許其不必參加工作、幷許其展緩實行制裁、但以不妨害國聯會全盤計畫之成功爲度、行政院一俟制裁方案委員會提出建議案之後、卽以實行時期通知各會員國、此項辦法在法理上非無根據、　　盟約第十六條而論、全體會員國、在原則上雖有參加制裁之相等義務、但一九二一年十月五日修正盟約第十六條議定書、曾將此條第四節加以修正、幷規定「行政院倘以爲爲某會員起見、將此項辦法中之任何辦法、在一指定時期內延緩實行、當能便於達到前節所述辦法之目的、又或以爲此項延緩乃爲减少此項會員所受損失或不便所必要、則行政院有權可以决定此項延緩、」然則行政院　於某某會員國得許其變通辦法、已由此項修正案加以承認明矣、至英國政府調動海軍之舉、旣與制裁有關，行政院似當加以贊可、關於經濟制裁一層、各關係國卽將舉行談判、法國外交部商業司帮辦古朗特爾業於今晨抵達此間、午後當與英國專家霍德萊開始討論、負責方面頃宣稱、嚴厲制裁手段、如斷絕外交關係、與封鎖之類、不致見諸實施、緣此次制裁計畫、係以一九二一年十月五日盟約第十六條修正案爲　礎、至此項修正案之用意、乃對於實行盟約過於嚴厲之手叚、加以防止故也云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）意總代表阿洛錫保留明日在國聯大會會議中答覆行政院申責意國各節之權、現眾咸注意瑞士·奧·匃·三國代表明日在大會中所取之態度、蓋對意之經濟制裁、將使三國受累更甚於意國也、大約三國因地理上之關係將放棄投票權、（八日路透社電）</p>
<h3>意對英試探　對阿講和條件　阿國堅持先撤兵</h3>
<p>（倫敦）據本社外交訪員所知、意大利政府對於阿比西尼亞開始軍事行動之後、曾在此間試探意見、以覘意阿兩國有無媾和之可能基礎、意國並曾建議將阿比西尼亞分爲兩部份、一爲該國近年所征服之土地、一爲該國原有領土、而以該國征服之地、委任意國統治、並以該國本部領土、歸由國際委任統治、卽所以迎合國聯會行政院五國委員會前所提出之建議案、此項辦法、意相墨索里尼當可加以接受、意國人士並謂此種解决方案、係在國聯會範圍之內、日內瓦與倫敦兩方面、自亦易予接受云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）阿比西尼亞代表並曾要求意軍撤退之後、始允開始和議、現在仍擬堅持此種立塲、六國委員會之報吿書卽係國聯今後一切行動之根據、法學家今日宣稱、關於國聯大會表决制戴問題、惟有贊成制裁之國家、始受實施此項行動之約束云、（七日國民電）</p>
<h3>制裁問題　英向德美接洽　請一致參加委員會工作</h3>
<p>（倫敦）消息靈通人士宣稱、日內瓦英國人士刻正考慮向德美兩國提出建議、請其麥加制裁方案委員會工作、以爲德國宣佈退出國聯會之後、所欠會費、迄未付淸、因而本月十四日雖屬該國退盟生效之日、但實際上未必卽能生效、此在官塲人士則謂、英國對於施行制裁一層、已在技術上加以考慮、例如限制與意國通商及取消軍火運往阿國禁令、甚至與意國斷絕外交關係各項步驟之可能性、均已加以考慮、但在日內瓦未能獲有集體决定之前、不致遽卽實行、至日內瓦方面所討論之制裁方案、預料各關係國、卽可成立協定、外相霍爾鑒於談判形勢至爲良好、業已决定中止日內瓦之行、第若外相必須親自出馬、則臨時尙可變更此項决定云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）政界與商界今皆以國聯如請德國參加對意之制裁、則德國將取何行動爲談話之主要資料、衆料國聯大會明日開會後、卽將以此事探詢德國、官塲宣稱、德國之覆文、將視國聯來文之措詞爲决、惟必將遵從希特勒屢次所發德國不欲捲入與己無關的戰爭之宣言、（八日路透電）</p>
<h3>海軍合作問題　法覆英書公佈　英對內容尚未滿意</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英國前向法詢問、如地中海英艦隊被人無端攻擊、法國可否予以援助、法國現已允之、據其復文稱、英國建議、如積極採用、恰可彌補二國政府所注重之集體安全制之缺陷、援助義務必須在英法間共同有之、俟政局空氣緊張達於恐將採用國聯盟約第十六條與第十七條之程度時、雙方卽聯合調査形勢、而後此種義務應發生效力云、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）法國復文大綱、頃由外交部發表、大致謂國聯會會員國、倘因對從事戰爭之國家實施制裁、而遭侵略時、法國均可加以軍事援助、但應附以下列之條件、（一）軍事援助、必須爲相互的、如法國保證援助英國、英國亦應作同樣保證、（二）無論海陸空方面、如受攻擊時、應一律適用相互援助辦法、（三）侵略國不論係國聯會員國、或非會員國、均應採取同樣辦法、（四）英國依照國聯會建議、實施制裁時、事先須與法國政府磋商、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）關於英國所詢他日英艦隊在地中海被攻擊時、法國可否予以援助一節、法政府之覆文、似與英政府心目中所預料之事故、不相吻合、故衆認此復文不如其所希望之美滿、爲之失望、法國覆文聲稱、互相援助之辦法、必須施用於任何侵略國、不問其是否爲國聯之會員、其意欲使英國於德國侵略時爲法國後援也、大約英國將向法國再有所接洽、互換意見、英國所詢者、係狹義的、僅言及特殊之一事、而法國覆文則範園廣大、將英國關於援助之詢問置於相互的基礎之上、而擴大其適用範圍、故英國欲法國更切實說明其關於若干點態度、（八日路透電）</p>

<h3>阿國大軍五十萬　全力防衛鐵路線　　意軍東南兩路謀取聯絡　北路苦戰下阿克森古城</h3>
<p>哈拉阿軍前綫　據此間今日戰報、阿軍現正固守北路及南路之綫、兩處繼續發生惡戰、雙方死傷甚衆、意軍雖有飛機坦克大砲及機關槍、但阿軍手執長槍大刀屢次衝鋒、與敵肉搏云、（七日國民社電）</p>
<p>哈拉　阿軍東路司令那西蒲今日向美聯社隨軍記者艾金斯稱、彼已在吉吉格集中戰士十五萬人、以防衛京吉鐵路、屆時或將發生最猛烈之血戰云、那氏對於此次戰事、並無空幻之希望、且明知失敗爲意中之事、惟彼擬奮力抵抗、以阻止意軍之前進、哈拉城中、一切景物皆難以形容、湫狹之街道中、毫無組織之軍隊、詬詈之聲不絕、而四週曠野叢山中之野蠻戰士、尙紛至沓來、無時或已云、（七日國民社電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）此間今日宣布、南路意軍已佔領意屬索馬里與英屬根尼亞接壞處之杜洛城、阿國與南方之交通已經斷絕、按杜洛城控制水路三條、意軍得此、卽可沿河向西方及西北方進行、以與索縣里方面之東路軍取得聯絡、該處軍隊現方進攻吉吉格及哈拉云、（七日國民社電）</p>
<p>北路意軍鞏固陣線</p>
<p>（羅馬）今日公報宣稱、阿比西尼亞之意軍現正從事鞏固所佔阿杜華以外之陣地、並組織交通綫、陸軍工程師刻在陣綫後努力工作、維持運輸之便利、意軍所佔區域內之土人、刻已照常營生、公報又稱、前數日戰事中、意軍獲戰利品頗多、並俘敵數百人、意軍死傷甚少、敵軍則大受創痛云、（八日路透社電）</p>

<h3>今日所望於運動者</h3>
<p>— 秉</p>
<p>全國運動會將於雙十節開。幕各省區之運動選手。刻已雲集上海。準備一顯身手。而一般人亦復分其注意力。於外患水災及意阿風雲之外。希望備悉此會之盛况。獲聞各項之最髙紀錄。更有束裝就道。不遠千里。以躬逢其盛爲快者。運動之爲國人所重視。於此可見。以方他國。熱烈之情。曾何多讓。然而時至今日。帝國主義對我之侵略。正如猛風疾雨其勢方張。國　國難。號呼於口者亦旣有年。而如縛益緊。曾無少紓之象。於斯而言運動。宜右異於承平之世。此必須注意也。蓋今日所望於運動者。不在選抜少數超羣之英雄。爲一般人傾羨之偶像。而在鍜鍊多數强健之體格。以擔負今後種種艱苦之事業。以故身爲選手者。固不必忽略一尺一寸一分一秒之差而不之爭。然亦不可惟一尺一寸一分一秒之差是爭。與會參觀者。固不必無視競賽技術運動姿勢而不之賞然。亦不可惟競賽技術運動姿勢之是賞。任何事皆然就其本身而言。初無所謂利弊。就其如何見用以觀。始有美惡之分。苟身臨全運會塲者悉明斯義。則雖個人競技之田徑賽。亦不失爲當前富有意義之運動。而三千小學生會合表演之練身操。自更屬動人觀感之舉。蓋體育之普遍化。運動之集團化。咸於此見其徵兆也。反之。設或選手與觀者共昧斯義。徒視全運爲炫技之良機。難得之熱閙。則當此凡百困頓之際。而耗不少之財力。勞廣衆之奔波。誠爲無益之事。我人固熱望其决不至於此也。</p>
<p>言及體育之普遍化。運動之集團化。我人有感不絕於心者。去年敎育部調查全國專科以上學校學生之體格。計受檢査者二萬餘人。其中有病患者佔三分之一强。同時上海市衛生局爲改善學校衛生起見。就市立某小學施行肺結核注射。計注射兒童八百餘人。起反應者佔三分之二弱。關於中等學生。最近陳傳哲女士發表一文於火公報。題曰「救救中學生」謂中等學生受學科繁重與會考制度之困迫。一般的有神經衰弱腦痛及肺結核之傾向。我人瞻矚所及。乃與陳女士抱有同感。二十以內之靑年。肌膚不充。顏色乾枯。坐立都無正狀。勞動如將不勝。察之家庭。求之道路。比比而是幾成通例。故言今日敎育界之嚴重問題。學生體格之一般的不健康必居其首。斷乎不容忽視。此一問題若不切實解决。則一切俱成虛幻。更無曙光可覩。查今日學校之中。練身操已爲常課。生理衛生之科目。亦佔相當講習時間。乃察其實效。非　無益。且得相反之惡果。謂非由於學校以例行公事視一切訓練一切敎學。不可得矣。夫練身操非止令學生伸臂舒腿而巳。必審其動作是否正確。持之是否以恒。生理衛生非北令學生獲得知識而已。必審其要義是否貫澈於若輩之日常生活。務須躬行實踐之舉。而一以例行公事視之。徒然聞鐘開操。按時授課。其何功之克奏。尤有甚者。學校不妨無視一般學生之日陷於贏弱。而不可無一二競技選手。取勝於運動會。爲學校揚其聲譽。更不妨督促一二選手晨夕跑跳。努力修練。爲取勝之準備。而不肯於一般學生之日常生活上時間分配上能力估計上切實注。俾若輩咸有强健之體格。歧趨至此運動競技非特全無意義。抑且爲堪以咒詛之舉矣。今當全運卽將開幕之時。而提出此近乎掃興之言。蓋恐國人覩盛大之全運。遂忘學生體格之一般的不健康。尤盼實際敎育者以此爲當前最急要之課題。對於學生之體育。必須如我人所云。以鍜鍊多數强健之體格爲歸。於此一前提之下。普遍化集團化之練身操。自當重於個人競技。而衛生之設施亦必與一切訓練一切敎學發生關係。乃爲允當。凡此又皆須躬行實踐。故不能以規則佈告爲止境。必隨時隨事計其實效。如是行之三年五年。再爲調査。或者可得學生體格漸致健康之報吿乎。果得此報吿。其引起國人熱烈之感慰。决不亞於獲覩盛大之全運也。</p>

<h3>實力頗可觀精彩則不多　馬華足球隊全勝靑年　　結果三比零上半時靑年負二隻　馬華人才平均聯絡似未臻佳境</h3>
<p>馬來亞華僑出席全運會足球選手隊、昨與靑年足球隊、作友誼比賽於申園、惟昨日天公不助、毛毛雨下個不停、至三時尙未止、故全國體育恊進會、以天雨比饗難成、至放進球迷約四五百人、三時十分、馬華隊始珊珊而來、然後再開始售票、一般捷足先到者、則大措其油、靑年隊自戰勝上海市代表隊後、雄心勃勃、昨日雖敗於馬華隊、非戰之罪也、乃實力稍遜人一籌耳、上半時二比〇、下半時一比〇、茲將戰情分誌如後、</p>
<p>首開紀錄</p>
<p>馬華隊在中綫開球後、即如排山倒海擁入靑年防地、靑年自非弱者、拚命拒敵、驚危數次、均獲偏安、惟馬華再接冉厲、竟由姚勝華攻入一球、首開紀錄、靑年乃努力反攻、終難得手、石城在中路截球、遞與徐步雲未能過關斬將</p>
<p>靑年請客</p>
<p>馬華毫不客氣、奮勇前進、關信德一、脚遠射忻子良滿意頭頂救出、不料頂上無光、反射入門、顧彪莫名其土地堂、任它進網、胡翼中得蔣兆祥接濟、向前進攻、被甄　麟救出、</p>
<p>頂上開花</p>
<p>戰事再起、趙靄生手吻皮球、裁判員執法如山、由謝慶福高射、一脚踢去、被顧彪接得、羅斗文得劉祖侃傳球、高出門外、胡翼中一次絕佳機會、頭頂過高、趙靄生大顯身手、救出阿斗、杜亞地傳與謝慶福、頭上開花、造成三比〇之總結果、馬華隊路、</p>
<p>觀察實力</p>
<p>馬華隊昨日尙未以正式陣綫出塲、然實力亦頗可觀、人材極爲平均、惜聯絡尙未臻純熟、而脚頭亦生疏、至數次可勝未勝、動作以昨日視之、頗不及香港、恐或初戰無大精彩、雙方陣綫如下、</p>

<h3>復旦卅週紀念　第二日盛況</h3>
<p>成績展覽內容極爲充實　足球比賽兄弟非常客氣　攝影成績美滿昔樂動聽</p>
<p>江灣復旦大學、因欣逢三十週紀念、特放假三日以資慶祝、其隆重盛大之典禮已於前日舉行、日昨各展覽室仍照常開放、飯後並有足球比賽、音樂演奏兩大活動表演、茲將詳情分誌於後、</p>
<p>成績一斑　此次各系均有成績展覽、地點凡爲簡公堂、報紙展覽會攝影展覽室文法各系及工商國貨展覽在爲、理學院則在子彬院內、圖書館純爲學　展覽、因內容充實、不事作僞得眞面目展示於社會、觀者絡繹於途、無不同聲稱譽、尤値得注意者、即報展會對於世界報紙收羅之豐富並有印刷機多架、當塲開動、統計計極準確、</p>
<p>攝影展覽　他如攝影會不以裸體照迎投社會興味且均係自動放大、作品百五十幅、琳郞滿目、美不勝收、聞將延至十日結束、以免觀者向隅云、</p>
<p>足球比賽　足球冒雨比賽、球證銀笛一聲、兄弟開始交腿、本校同學均年靑力强、奔跑甚速、校友則人老賢刀不老、旦油滑異常、大家都不爭較勝負、你來我往、客客氣氣、直至天昏地黑、始鳴金收兵、</p>

<h3>小男兒（七）（〇）</h3>
<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>第五章　奇頑的小女子</p>
<p>一天課後，裴夫人見了裴先生，就說道；「茀力子，我有一個新意思」</p>
<p>「呀，親愛的，是什麽呢」？說着他便傾耳靜聽她的新計劃，因爲濁的意思有許多是這麽滑稽突梯，直使人不能不發一噱，可是大概是頗合理的，所以他也樂於去實施的呢。</p>
<p>「小梅需要一個伴，男孩子們能够再得到一個女孩子做伴也要好些：你知道我們是相信把小男兒和小婦人一同培植起來的，現在正是我們按照理想做去的時候，不容再緩了，他們對於小梅，忽而寳貝得很，忽而加以凌虐，她的脾氣巳經因此而變壞了，他們應該知道怎樣溫良文雅，怎樣待人以禮，要做到這一點，須得要有姑娘們在旁邊，這比什麽事來得有效。」</p>
<p>「你眞有見識，現在我們應該招收那一個呢」？裴先生間道，從濁夫人的眼色裏，知道她早已預備好一價人要提出來了，於是她就回答道：</p>
<p>「小小郝阿妮」。</p>
<p>「什魔！便是孩子們綽號叫做一頑皮南恩」的嗎」？裴先生驚問這，看去臉上又很像要笑的模樣。</p>

<h3>頌辭</h3>
<p>— 張公權</p>
<p>夫夫帛之為物，生人所必需也，昔之成也以手工，今則以汽機，其遲速之率，多寡之差，途之人岡弗知也，海通以來，　輪舶狎至，布之為類也繁，而值廉，而帛之為類也尤繁而值尤廉，嚮時吳越間，以出產名者，幾盡為所奪，歲計利之漏於海外者，不可以萬名，　　之間，識時之士，亟起直追，競購機設廠，以謀挽救大較利鈍互見，不必其定操左券，以獲　稱也，惟美亞織綢廠則不然，其策畫之周密，其設備之完善，其出品之情良，其花樣之新奇，皆非他廠能及，而又能持之以恒心，赴之以毅力，十餘年來，由小而擴之大，由分而使之合，氣象萬千，方興未艾，固有令人心折者已，竊願其行之邦域內者，將推之邦域以外，由亞而歐而美，靡不口譽而心羨之，羣頌我之絲織品為世界第一，豈不懿歟，茲以十五周紀念特刋，屬為弁首，爰樂得而書之，以為勸勉焉，</p>

<h3>美亞綢廠十五周紀念</h3>
<p>中華國貨產銷合作協會</p>
<p>蠶絲發明，在中國已有幾十年的歷史，海通以還，牠佔　出口的第一位，馳譽於世界市場，獨步一時，</p>
<p>近幾十年來，因為外人對於蠶種的改良，織物的進步，染色的鮮艷，和人造絲的發明，都在突飛猛進，以致中國絲綢，在國外市場，一天天衰落下來，</p>
<p>在整個對外商戰來講，教們實在是節節敗退，但是在這幾十年裏，奮鬥史上，中國的絲綢業，也儘有許多光榮的戰士，美亞綢廠就是其中最有名的一個，</p>
<p>現在美亞織綢廠，以百戰之身，又在舉行開　十五周紀念了，我們撫念着中國絲業過去的光榮，追慕着美亚織綢廠右鬥的史跡，我們深願藉美亞的努力，維絲業於不墜，更企禱着由美亞的革新，底國產於昌大，</p>

<h3>本廠十五年回顧</h3>
<p>— 蔡聲白</p>
<p>創業難，守成亦不易，　以二十世紀工商業之競爭，非徒守成而已，蓋不進則退，非優勝，即失敗，無所謂成，更無所謂守，守則無進步，無進步則必歸淘汰也，本廠自創業以來，忽忽已十五寒暑，返觀初創時代，華路襤褸，機數僅十餘，出品僅數種，以視目前之成績，與民國九年之春，固不可同日而語矣，當時機械還不如今日，技術遠不如今日，推廣銷路之方法，遠不如今日，惟一般人的物質優良精美之需要，亦遠不如今日，而生活程度之高，乃從業者不多，競爭力薄弱，亦　不如今日也，故以本廠昔日之機械，昔日之技術，敷諸於昔日之時代，同遊刃而有餘，宜其一帆風順，機數日增，出口日夥，而銷路亦日廣，本廠基礎，亦日漸鞏固，由五週紀念而十週紀念，以達於今日舉行此十五週紀急也，今日則不然，不持從業於絲職者日眾，且人才輩出，技術日晉，而國民物質慾望，與生活程度，日與俱高，乃其講買力，以連年災饉兵燹，以及入超無窮，致購買力反日與俱低，益使出品非更加精良，售價非逐步减低，不足以使出品易於脫售，則成本之如何可使其减輕，技術之如何可使其進步，實為當前重要之答案，是以我謂不徒守成而已，當更深思熟慮，以求進步者也，聲白於民國十年春，加入本廠，經營一切，屈指亦已十四年矣，今日欣逢十五周紀念，尤感絲織業影響於國計民生者至鉅，蓋自種桑育蠶，以至綢疋販賣為止，直接間接依賴為生者，殆有一萬萬人之繼，而歐美日本之絲幟業，無論機械技術，今皆在我國之上，我不急起直追，則必敗無疑，整個絲織業，苟全部失敗，則此一萬萬人之生計，將安所托庇，本廠於此十五年中之進展，以營業額而言，雖有一與七十之比，而瞻顧國內本業其他之從業者，則猶未能與本廠相馳並驅，共同發展者，則更覺本廠將來負責之愈益嚴重，不可　自慶幸而以為滿足者也本廠於此十五年中，技術管理及營業進展之過程，均可約分為四時期，第一時期為民國十三年以前，新　初試，都屬草創，猶未達邁進之機，第二時期為民十三至民十六之間，基礎確定，人才煉達，乃謀漸進，以圖發展，第三時期為民十七至民二十，適逢物早民安之際，乃作登高望遠之舉，其銳進程度，殆有一日千里之勢，第四時期為民廿一迄現在為止，則時艱民貧，各定凋敝，本廠不能例外，茹苦含辛，夙夜戰兢，不求急功，差堪不衰，而回溯第一時期，時猶新創，一切皆為事物所限，都屬試驗性質，創辦人莫觴清先生，同時方經營他種事業，未遑全力致此，乃邀聲白加入，改組一切，略加資本，添置美國機械，規定管理章則，釐定營業方針，遂增軌物，始易行進，惟是當時之絲織業，猶未有顯著之進步，未脫手工業之規範，是以聲自所規訂者，亦僅個人之理想，以體念而得，歐美之藍本，未敢必其適合於中國，僅將不適宜於絲織業進展之岩障，逐步革除，以求他日深造之基礎而已，且當時國內經濟力，尚未見有竭蹶之象，從業者，尤不甚眾，是以雖在試騐期中，而殊少事與願違之跡，卒使三四種新出品，不特通行於國內，並得暢銷於南洋，如華絨葛六號葛等，至今營業勿衰，此皆第一時期中，極可紀念之成績也，第二時期，承前期試騐未告失敗，且成績優越之誘掖，乃謀如何昌大其業，於是一面增設分廠，改進技術，添製各種高貴出品，以應市場需求，而杜舶來高貴綢緞之輸入，決定本廠最前線之目的，為挽回絲織品之漏巵，務期國產綢緞，與舶來綢緞站終勢不兩立之地位，又以本廠組織，係合資住質，而分廠日增，人事管理，不可不深切注意，以求指　之效，而增其效能，於是設總管理處及總發行所，分屬隸部，俾得分工合作，綱舉目張，益無偏普之弊，故出口之質量，亦得日益進步，而營業額之昇化，與第一時期相較，則有六與一之比矣，即以江浙一個銷區而言，較諸第一時期，殆亦增三十餘倍焉，</p>
<p>第三時期之開始，適為國民革命軍北伐成功，國民政府奠基首都，百廢俱興，氣象萬千，本廠隨時代環境，首將人事管理，澈底革新，深覺政事休明，則各種事業，亦必邁進，本廠未敢閉戶造車，乃先設一試騐所，專事研究試騐，一面自行發明新出品，一面專派技師將歐美新品從事倣造，於是製造廠得悉心製造，不必兼求發明，出品種類及數量，乃益　增，時國內交通，因政府乏銳意建設，日益便利，邊僻遠道，亦易溝通，本廠乃派專員多人，組織展覽團，出發宣傳，窮年累月，寒暑無間，國產綢緞之華發光煥不輸舶來，雖　辭婦孺，亦無勿知之，無勿識之，本廠既以復興國產綢緞及挽回漏巵為前提，而於此時期之末，江浙一帶，營蠶絲事業者，因國外貿易之銷路，方遭失敗，農民之種桑育蠶者，以虧本折閱之關係，竟有鋤桑棄種，仰展與嗟者，本廠益覺責任之重大，是以激增產量，以求蠶絲之不能輸出於外洋者，得盡量消費於國內，差幸本廠南北奔走呼號宣傳乏結果，竟獲成　，在民十九年，營業額突高至五百餘萬元之　，惟是社會需要激增，以本廠十餘總分廠日夜乏趕製，猶虞供不敷求，深恐品質或將參差，一廠專業之信譽猶小，整個國產綢緞業之隆替，有關國計民生者實大，乃　自設檢查所，　有各種機械，專於事前檢查絲　，事後儉查　疋，凡絲質之不同者，則分類而採用之，庶成綢後，每種品質，　合規定標準，凡綢疋之稍有疵劣者，則剔除而別儲之，並研究其所以致疵之原因，俾勿再犯此弊，又　產量增加，人事日繁，乃更設訓練所，專司訓練各項人才，俾工務事務人員咸得人盡其長焉，</p>
<p>第四時期，則以前期之猛進，成效大著，方欲新訂策劃，以謀大舉，詎知各地遽告旱災，而九一八及一二　之事變，又驀地雷發，馴至農村破產，百業凋落，社會經濟，日陷苦悶，人民之購買力，亦日以薄弱，絲綢以需求之衰退，不特銷額不易擴充，而價格之慘跌，尤為歷年所罕覩，本廠範圍浩大，職工綦眾，不容稍有躑躅，乃謀充實力量起見，於民國二十二年之春，將各廠合併改組為股份有限公司，庶管理上愈臻嚴密周詳，一面改良發明各項新出品，一面研究節省各種消耗，雖至竹頭木屑，亦勿仟其廢棄，俾得减輕成本，父詎知今年則以銀根奇緊，及各地水災之關係，工商業愈難維持，本廠同人，不得不相約茹苦含辛，共圖奮鬥，深信謀事在人，成事並不在天者也，</p>
<p>綜而言之，本廠十五年來，以機數言，由廿餘台而進至千數百台，以直接從業於本廠人員而言，由五十餘人，而進之三千餘人，以出品而言，華絨葛華絲葛兩三種普通綢緞，而進至於絲絨喬其累絲紗及四梭箱三　軸之織物，以營業額言，由數萬元，而進終六七百萬元，以銷區言，由江浙而達於世界各國，皆足為本廠史乘之犖犖大端，可得而　之者，　任何事業，皆一日千里，而歐美絲織事業之　大於斯者，實猶滄海之與一粟，則本廠猶渺乎其小焉者也，矧年來國內經濟方不景氣，長江黃河水災，徧地已成澤國，農村破產，原氣大傷，而蠶絲事業，更一落千丈，風雨連朝，陰晦少霽，此後之如何守成，如何尅自奮發，以達完成挽回漏巵，救濟本國蠶絲事業者，聲白不敏，竊猶不敢謂有速效，惟是十五載與本廠全體同人，共樹此基，均願克苦砥礪，惟力是視，持以恒心，出以毅力，倘蒙邦人君子，進而教之，則尤深幸渴望也已，</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （肖白）</p>
<p>火石不經過磨擦，火花就不會發出來，同樣，假使人們不遇到刺激，他們的生命的火燄，是不會燃燒起來的。</p>
<p>往往有許多的人們，他們非到窮途潦倒，無路可走的時候，就不會發現他們自己的「力量」，災禍的磨折，反足以帮助他啟發了「自己」。困苦·阻礙。彷彿是將　的生命，鏧成美好的鐵鎚和斧斤。祗有失敗，祗有困難，祗有　暗裏面奮鬥出來的光明，纔能使一個人變爲堅強，變爲無敵。</p>
<p>所以，一切的阻礙·磨折·我們不要看它是仇敵，相反的我們要當它恩人，我們　可抓住這阻礙的核心，去鍛鍊我們種種「克勝阻礙」的能力。</p>
<p>「命運」兩字是不成立的，它決不能阻止我們努力的前程！</p>
<h3>埋頭幹與了世事</h3>
<p>— 呉毓秀</p>
<p>青年人都要富有朝氣，千萬別感受到了一些不如意的激　就灰心起來，請看：古今往來的大偉人，大　業家，誰不是從艱苦奮鬥　掙扎出來。當他們在未得志的時候，是如何的被人鄙薄，輕視，可是鄙薄和輕視，適足以增長自己的堅強的意旨，努力的精　。</p>
<p>社會是勢利的，等到你一日功成名就，從前一輩看薄你鄙薄你的，都會得轉變來歌頌你稱謂你的，所以，當你立志向前，埋頭苦幹的辰光，儘管可以笑罵由人，你抱定不屈不撓的精神，一味的幹，那才是今日青年人的出路，如此，那末你的前途一定光明的。</p>
<p>往往有許多人，起初也存心做番事業，因爲立志不堅，「所如輒阻」，就灰心一半，漸漸的　壯志消磨」，「暮氣甚盛」，做什麽事也就不起勁，正應了「了世事」的一句俗諺。</p>
<p>這種，半雖由環境所造成，一半還是自己的放棄，自己的因循，等到「年華老大」，「時光不再」，那已經追悔　　了。</p>
<p>可見，青年人切莫染到了「今日有酒今日醉」的習性，不自振　，要曉得時光是不停留的，「做人」，一定要把這「做」字認清，「了世事」是欺人自欺的一條絕徑。</p>
<p>明天是廿四年的雙十國慶，敢拿「埋頭幹與了世事」的一番話，來同讀者共勉之。</p>
<h3>粉筆</h3>
<p>— 顏波光</p>
<p>一個敎員跨進了敎室上課，除口講指劃以外，就端賴粉筆傳達非口講所能形容的字句，所以當敎員也稱爲粉筆生涯。</p>
<p>現代的小學敎員生活費清苦得難以維持個人生活，尤其是鄉村小學，敎員的生活費連飯資每月僅有十元，簡直是迫着敎員改行！竟有許多人也因此不願再吃粉筆灰了。</p>
<p>說起粉筆，有幾處學校，校長　限定敎員上課一次，祗能用一支粉筆。這固然是校中經費的困難，但是校長先生也限得太嚴格一點吧？</p>
<p>在不久以前，我在某鄉村執敎鞭，很有幾個小學生向我索取用賸的粉筆頭，天天這樣索取是怪麻煩的。問他有什麽用？有幾個說練習算術：有幾個說練寫生字；更有幾　却　着嘴笑。我費了一星期的偵察工夫，發覺伊們利用粉筆頭做小賭錢的工具，伊們把粉筆頭磨成了四方形，用　點上了　　三四五六」，儼然變了一粒四方的好骰子，偷偷地賭　　贏，見了敎員走過，很迅捷地用手掌撳得粉碎，敎員因捉不牢證據，也不知道伊們做什麽事？</p>
<p>自從被我發覺後，我很嚴厲的告誡他們，賭錢不是好學生應做的事，切切遵守不賭錢的信條！以後再沒有學生索用粉筆頭了。</p>
<h3>廿四年來之收獲！</h3>
<h3>四歲兒戒絕烟酒</h3>
<p>— 貢</p>
<p>美國紐傑賽州西柏七生地方，有一嬰孩，甫屆四歲，本嗜烟酒，現已戒絕。</p>
<p>此孩名米開諾爾曼，在三週歲的時候，即酷喜烟酒。一年之前，米開曾攝了一張照片，片上他口銜大雪茄一枝，態度非常老練，有如成人。這張照片刊在報紙上，於是，許多信件，雪片也似的投到諾爾曼家裏來，都是從世界各國的戒烟會和易俗團體那裏寄來的。</p>
<p>米開的祖母，看了這許多信件，不覺大爲感動　於是着手叫他戒烟戒酒。據伊帶着驕傲的神氣說，米開現在僅在星期日那天吸烟，至於酒，已經絕不上口了。</p>
<p>倘使米開在別一天暗中偷吸，那麽他的六歲的姊姊，桃綠翠，就去告訴祖母，伊必馬上非叫他丟掉不可。</p>
<p>米開身體很健，金色鬈髪，父親是一個機器工人。他的祖母說，有一個紐約的醫生，在報紙看見了伊孫兒的嗜好，覺得非常奇怪，特地趕來看視這孩子。結果他說，米開各部正常，並無異態，並且較他一般同年的孩子爲強壯。</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第二十回　掙命看嬌孫抱頭落淚荒年憶往事種麥招殃</p>
<p>士廉道：剛才我到後門來過一次的，你這老太太有了病，可與我無干。胡嫂子道：我們並不說你老爺的什麽事，就是請你老爺作個好事，把那個人引出來見一見。有道是：救人一命，勝造七級浮屠……士廉耳聽他說話，眼睛可是射在老太太身上，見那老太太的頭，微偏着只管向前擺動，滿頭蒼白的頭髮，被風吹着，只管向臉上披下來，眼睛雖然睜着，但是眼皮的力量很小，可以看出他極力掙扎，還不免下垂的慘象。士廉想着，這個樣子，他就不死，也爲時不久，自己還是閃開爲妙，於是向胡嫂子亂點着頭道：好的好的，我去和賈老爺通個消息，一定讓他放出賈太太來看，他這樣一句話，却是比向病人打了一下強心針還有力量，老太太立刻說出話來道，老爺，若是這樣，你好事作大了，我在這裏等着。那枯澀的嗓音，和那斷續的句子，士廉聽了，殊覺得事情有些不便，於是扭轉身來，就向小西天裏面走。不料到了賈多才屋子外時，偏是他在會客，談話的聲音，牽連不斷，由裏面傳了出來　故意由窗子外面經過，向裏面膘了一眼，就看到月英低了頭，縮在屋角落裏坐着。心裏想着，這個時候，若要進去報告這不幸的消息，不但賈多才不高興，而且那位客人，也要嫌着自己不識相。（三三六）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>這一晚我既知道尚須侍候太后洗澡，便恭而敬之的隨着伊一起走進寝宮中去，同時還有四個宮女也隨着我徐步而入：當時我因爲不知道該做些什麽事情，心上很慌張，最初還道是要我直接動手，去給伊洗澡，過了一會，才知道直接動手給伊洗澡的便是那四個宮女，我却祇須站在旁邊監視監視，指點指點。其實我又不曾在什麽澡室裏當過執事，如何懂得這樣那樣的去指點伊們呢？幸而太后也並不真的要我給伊照料。伊逢到無論什麽事情，都歡喜自作主張，忽東忽西的指揮人家：這件洗澡的事又豈肯放鬆，讓那四個宮女給伊胡亂洗擦之理？所以實際上，我們每次被派着進去「伺候」伊洗澡，還不如爽快說被派着進去「看」伊洗澡的來得和事實相符些。</p>
<p>最先是由兩個太監抬進了一只大的木盆來，可是這木盆却決非我們尋常所能見到的那種木盆，它的內部雖是木質，外面却包着一重很厚的銀皮，所以永遠是很光明燦爛的。盆內已有大半盆的熱水盛着。除這木盆之外，那些太監還捧來了許多潔白的毛巾。其時太后已安坐在一張矮几上了，這張矮几的靠背還可以隨時取下或裝上，以便那些宮女給伊擦洗背部。（四三三）</p>
<p>拉雜話</p>
<h3>兒童入影戲院問題</h3>
<p>— 海</p>
<p>最近我們的敎育當局曾下過一個命令，凡六歲以內的兒童，不得入影戲院。據我瞧來，在這年齡智識未開，實在還不懂什麽，即使給他們看影戲，也是莫明其妙的，其所以不許他們進影戲院去的緣故，也許是爲的秩序問題吧。在英國方面也有禁止兒童進影戲院的事，不過年齡方面還要大些。英國的人有贊成的，也有不贊成的。當時有一位前任上議院議員的琪妮李女士Jennie　Lee曾發表一篇談話，以爲是沒有禁止的必要的。伊說：</p>
<p>「我很清楚的記得，當那影戲第一次到我所住的村子裏來的時候，這是一件轟動一時的大事。我們一輩小孩子很懇切的等候着禮拜六的日戲，一到了那天，就拿了幾個辨士，拉了許多小弟弟小妹妹，飛一般趕到影戲院中去，激動得幾乎連氣都透不過來。普通的座位，是每人一辨士，有絨墊子特別座位，每人兩辨士，有一座響喨的鋼琴奏着，我們所熟悉的樂曲，接着一片黑暗，而影戲開塲了。我們一見之下，快樂得呌喊起來。我還很記得那時銀幕上有一輛汽車越來越近，越來越大，嚇得前排一位胖老太太，直跳起來，恐怕被那汽車撞倒了。但是我們小孩子聽了伊那種驚呼的聲音，兀自拍手歡呼，覺得好玩得很。</p>
<p>「可是我們小孩子雖歡迎影戲，而我們的父母却極力反對，不許我們再進影戲院，這種壞地方去。如今隔了二十年，我想起了前事不覺自己問着自己，我們該不該給孩子們進影戲院去呢？</p>
<p>「據我過去的經騐告訴我，那當然是應該許他們去的。因爲影戲院是最足以滿足孩子們的好奇心？影戲院簡直好像是「天方夜談」中的仙毯，它帶我們走到許多的地方，遇見各國的人民，觀察鄉間的生活，研究進步無窮的種種機器。影片中又有一般滑稽的人，引我們笑樂；又有一般可惡的惡徒，使我們的血沸騰起來；還有曼麗畢克馥片中的種種苦情，會使我們悲哀落淚，而又想學伊梳成一卷卷的鬈髪。我們小孩子所尤其歡迎的，便是西部影片中那些牧牛郎和紅種人，騎着馬往來飛跑。我們看完了影戲，也就騎馬似的跑回家去，自以爲也是牧牛郎和紅種人了，而所做的一切游戲，也往往是從銀幕上抄襲下來的。</p>
<p>「於是那些反對影戲院的人，就會說道：「正因如此，就不應該給小孩子們進影戲院去，不見那牧牛郎和紅種人已不大在銀幕上出現，而換了詩家谷和紐約的一般流氓與暴徒了」。小孩子們看了這種影戲，就得到了一個惡印象。那些善於學樣的孩子們，跑回家去，也就學着流氓，暴徒們的行爲，當做是一種游戲，這豈不是很危險的事嗎？</p>
<p>「兒童們的游戲，不過是一種游戲罷了，未必就會學着流氓和暴徒所爲，而犯那抵觸法律的罪惡。若說是爲了防患未然起見，那麽地方官和敎育當局，就不該許可這種影片，映在影戲院的銀幕之上，又何必因此而剝奪兒童們看影戲的權利呢？</p>
<p>「影戲中的事實，雖然出於幻想的很多，而描寫人生的現實生活的，也實在不少。譬如：美國早年的影片大都表演開發西部的冒險史，所以牧牛郎和紅種人是常在那裏活躍着的。現代的美國影片，便常常表演那都市中惡黨的罪惡史。這些影片，都可說是描寫現實生活的。最可恥的，是英國的影戲界，往往效學美國好萊塢的壞處攝製影片。凡是有意識的人就應當組織起來，把這種影片拋入汪洋大海，不但不許兒童們看，連成人也是要不得的。</p>
<p>「總之，倘有人要絕對的禁止兒童們看影戲，我是反對到底的，要知不上幾年，他們也得投身到社會中去，影片無論好壞，總可以給他們體騐人生，一到社會中去過那現實的生活，那就可以把先前在影片中所見的一切，作爲參考的資料了。</p>
<p>「我們倘要凈化這個萬惡的世界，齷齪的社會，那末一般成人，就應當負起責任來，不要爲非作惡，免得攝入影片，使兒童們也受到惡影響。這纔是治本的方法。至於禁止兒童看影戲，那未免因噎廢食了。」</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>「空想的愛」和「實行的愛」</h3>
<p>— 辛人</p>
<p>脫不了「秀才氣」的「靑年男女」，有許多原想轟轟烈烈地來「為時代」墓一點應盡的責任。逕些人都明：現在已經不是傾全身心在「鍾情」和「懷春」的時候了，應該作點有「社會意義」的行動和事業。</p>
<p>這種動機，原是値得　美的。然而，許多有了「認識」的靑年男女，一踏上社會行動的道路，便始而興奮狂熱，繼而焦悶不堪，終而消極頽喪。這時候是要吶喊而無魄力和才能，不徬徨也不可得了。</p>
<p>這確是今日的「靑年男女」們間一個重大的問題。而這個問題，偏是在一些「吿靑年」之類的　訓裏，找不到完滿的解答的。</p>
<p>但是，在距離現在約莫半個多世紀的時候，社斯退夫斯基（Feodor　Dotoevsky）却用了「悲痛的殘酷」，把這個問題暴露出來了。在一卡拉馬佐夫兄弟」（The　brithers　Karamaov）那部巨大的小說的第二編第四節裏，一位現在是應該尊稱爲「活佛」的高僧左西馬，說是一個醫生有一次曾向他這樣吿白道」</p>
<p>「我愛人類，可是有一件事使得我自己吃驚的。這沒有別的，就是對一般人類愛得愈深，對個別的人類就愛得愈少。在空想上，對於貢獻人類這件事，母寗是達到幾乎奇怪的想念，大有一遇必要的機會，即可爲人類而背懸十字架之勢；可是相反地我却不能跟誰在一間房子裏一起度過兩天。這是從經騐得知的。什麽人一從近我的左右，他的個性立刻壓迫着我自已的自尊心和自由。所以我甚至能僅在一晝夜之中，對那有卓越的人格者也感到憎惡。有的是吃飯太久，有的是傷風，不斷地抽着鼻涕，這都使我憎厭。總之是，人們一接觸到我自己，我立刻便成爲他的仇敵。反過來說，對於個別的人類的憎惡越深，對於人類全體的愛也跟着愈加熱烈。」</p>
<p>這醫生的吿白，不替是一把銳利的向着自己，或者說簡直是向着「我們」的解剖刀。高憎左西馬（他當然是杜斯退夫斯基的「留聲機」）便解釋說，這是和「實行的愛」相對的「空想的愛」。他說道：</p>
<p>「實行的愛比起空想的愛來，是幾乎令人恐怖地困難的吓　空想的愛揭望急速成功，要人看見。實際上也有些極端的人，要一刻不延地把它弄成功了，像戲素上所演的，使大家佩服；甚至雖因此而喪失生命也在所不惜。然而一到了實行的愛，就沒有別的，只是勞働和忍耐呵！」</p>
<p>這裏所謂「勞働和忍耐」，是應該離開「奴隸哲學的立場，才有意義的。杜斯退夫斯基所爲的這一番話，和「聖經」（Bible）的「新約」「馬太傳福音書」第二十三章第三節—第七節中所說的話比較起來，是有　的。</p>
<p>「……他們能說不能行。他們將難擔的重擔，捆起來放在人肩頭上，自己一個指頭也不肯動。他們做事，都是爲呌人看見，將佩戴的經文做覽了，衣裳穗子做長了。他們愛坐筵席的上座，會堂的高位。歡喜人家在街市上給他請安，又歡喜人稱呼他說：夫子，夫子。」</p>
<p>當然，「聖經」裏所提起的這種典型（「讀書人」即今之「秀才」也—和「法利賽人」），和前面所提起的那一種典型，是不同的，但又是不能不回的。帶便地，在這裏也許可以窺見杜斯退夫斯基對「聖經」的「精神的聯繋」的簿影；他方面，還可以知道「聖經」雖然一向受人改纂虛飾，但直到今日　它還保護着多少不滅的燦爛的光輝。</p>
<p>從「鍾情」「懷春」的個人的愛的重心，轉移到「全人類的愛」上，這是一個進步的過程，歷史用了不知多少的生命與鮮血，才使一般「青年男女」們從「桃色的夢」裏醒來。但一覺醒來，睡意猶在，况且眼前又是漫漫的黑暗。在這裏問題就成爲問題了。</p>
<p>我們還不妨聽聽那位高僧左西馬的懲戒：「最重要的必須避免虛偽，各種的虛偽，特別是對自己本身的虛偽。覜察自己的虛偽，每一個鐘頭—不，每一分鐘，去發現它！」</p>
<p>所謂「觀察自己的虛僞」，倒不是要我們離開大家，鎭天躱在房子裏呆視着自己的鼻子的意思。沒有在和社會的人類相關的行爲中去檢討我們的一切，是不能得到「自己認識」和「自己救度」的。</p>
<p>「空想的愛」和「實行的愛」的矛盾，表現在思想和行爲的二重性上。杜斯退夫斯基的作品裏的人物，都是在這二重性的矛盾中苦惱着的。這二重性固然是他們的環境的遺傳，但並非不可解决的缺憾。如果杜斯退夫斯基也知道「神」就是我們自己，那末，對於他的許多處在「地下室」裏，身受着「罪與罰」的主人公們，也不會給以那樣虛幻到幾乎是絕望的希望吧。</p>
<p>在我們這些「秀才」流中，一殷地，嘴巴越饗的人就愈多帶着這種「愛的二重性」。但是—「爲什麼看見你兄弟眼中有剌，倒不覺自己眼中有梁木呢？你眼中有梁木，怎能對兄弟说：容我替你撥出眼中的刺來呢？假冒爲善的人，你先將自己眼中的梁木除去，才能看得淸楚，將你兄弟眼中的刺潑出來呢。」（「新约」「爲太福音書」第七章第三節—第五節。）</p>
<h3>喪鐘響吧！（散文詩）</h3>
<p>— 慕芝</p>
<p>喪鐘響吧——</p>
<p>街上的收音機咿啞咿啞嘩啦嘩啦地奏着，奏着冶荡的爵士樂，惻艷的小調，俚俗的粵曲：那是绝望者自己的咒詛，那是流行熱病者的狂囈，那是猛獸野合後力竭的呻吟，那是自殺前的狂歡之夜……聽呵，死期將近的巨人自己朗唱着自己的娩歌了！</p>
<p>喪鐘響吧——</p>
<p>有節拍的門牌聲！這大都會的脈搏！劃破了深夜的岑寂。大街，小巷，這裏，那裏都響者這尖銳而單調的魔樂。受禁咒的人們由呼喝嬸笑而漸歸於沈默！死一般的沈默！他們以報仇的血眼互釘着，呆呆的瞧着命運的骰子簸弄勝負，屛息靜聽着將涸的生之血液一點一滴地流過去。他們偶然　的是金錢，長輸的却是他們的有限而無聊的性命。聽呵，垂死的巨人自己操着鋤鍫營着自己的生壙了！</p>
<p>喪鐘響吧——</p>
<p>這裏喃喃地嘀咕著佛號，那裏嘹亮地唱著經卷：這裏描寫者蛇的神符，那裏鬧著莊嚴的法會　術士飛着饞涎，善男女們跪獻着血肉。鬼狐在白盡形，游魂殭屍在鬧市上游戲。善哉　善哉！在病榻中的巨人已聽到最後的祈祷魘勝了！</p>
<p>喪鐘　吧——</p>
<p>說敎者扳起面孔，　着紙上的敎條，祭帥們倖倖的勸他人爲善；譫語裏不忘往代的光榮，祖傳的假骨董在破落户的手中摩挲着。聽呵，彌留中的巨人在迥光反照的一剎那中已口授遺囑了！喪鐘還不響麽？</p>
<h3>市塲</h3>
<p>— 子岡</p>
<p>被一部分的精明人所注意養的拍賣塲。</p>
<p>這是一個「市」，是在吃飯錢之餘還有兩個大的人的「市」　和那保存着太古遺風的逢單逢雙的趕集想像，只是，其中隔着一條金錢的鴻溝，像一筒老農的藉以舒緩疲憊的早烟比一要揑在白手裏躺在沙發上的雪茄。</p>
<p>廣告在商人心中佔了信用，每天每天，不倦地在白紙黑字上廣佈拍賣的日期——大家　光的好機會。</p>
<p>大玻璃窗外勾住了精明的眠晴，想窺探一下，有沒有適合的東西，如果你問到管理人，他們會不憚煩地吿訴你，帶着炫耀誇飾的像兒。這讓拍賣前幾天的一些顧客作起慰心的夢來。</p>
<p>如果天晴，早早地，拍賣塲裏便擠滿了人，除了一些木器是容易審査的之外，每隻眼睛願意從頭號看到末號，零星的家用品，質料上好而微舊的衣裟，玲瓏精巧的玩具，整捆雜　着的醫本……</p>
<p>猜忖，撫摸，疑難——</p>
<p>一臉油的差役巡視着，留神三隻手的人，也答復顧客的問話，譬如：今天的給價錢如何遞增，還有什麼新貨沒有。最執稔稔的只用眼力的是一些專收舊貨的漢子，這些行家的眼和心商量，比那街頭的打鼓收舊貨的闊綽，但也有那把小鼓棒架在耳朶上審視東西的神氣：仔細！偶然，各行衆間打着招呼，露出臨陣前的莊肅。</p>
<p>照着時刻，主持拍賣的人走上了桌子——臨時的司令台。收起了　笑，整屋子靜下來。</p>
<p>上手　瞧了簿子喊起號碼，下茅的忙着舉起那些所喊到的東西了嘴角邊帶了誇示，不時回過頭去詢問那嘴忙的上手，來一點質證。</p>
<p>聽着上手關於物品的解釋，塲中的心跳起來，决定取槍，給價，　增。</p>
<p>起先是一些零星用品，如一些瓶罐，熨培，汽爐，痰盂，……爲　小物件反　引起買客的猶疑，上手人忙着唇舌，加着一些詳細的注解，甚至：</p>
<p>「醫痰盂，老牌子，沒有疤，……」</p>
<p>「洋磁馬桶，老瑞典脾—」志不了洋涇浜：「Closet　Sweden　made；made　by　Sweden·」</p>
<p>聽衆們哈哈大笑起來。</p>
<p>然而價錢也加了上去，會由幾角加到兩三塊錢。</p>
<p>高等華人安靜地守着，鬼子們也適意地坐在高處諦聽，最興　的是那些「行家」，比貓捉耗子還凝神的眼珠把握着自己的目的物，留神着價格的上　。</p>
<p>在桌前漸漸騰出了地方時　「行家」們爬了上去，含着烟頭，用黑帽孟　敞開的胸懷，額上的汗滴凝着一些機智和計算，目光由目的物轉到也在這目的物上打主意的敵手，或　是敵手們。大家交換着惡意的笑，表示着內行，有着「拚個你死我活」的神氣，</p>
<p>噴着唾沫，使勁地加着價格，那袋子裏充實的便佔了勝利。</p>
<p>弊端發生了，略略熱悉點的知道，那高價如超出眞的價値時。把爭奪引起了顧客的欣羨，終於出最廉價的不是行家們，而是外行的傻瓜。</p>
<p>這兒，也有舊舊買，對着那整梱的洋書懷着天大的期望，縱然自己連字母都像隔世人一樣生疏，也願意在　價時拿過來再細瞧瞧，不怕出了倒過來瞧書頁的笑話。</p>
<p>專爲搜　一兩本書的買客只好歇手，爲的是有些書對於他楚廢物。書賈們臉上　出得意的笑。</p>
<p>直到喊了末後的木器，人才靜下來，這對於每個人的需要的百分數不大，一直無所獲的人溜了出去，剩下一些戰勝者等候，自已的戰利品。</p>
<p>散出來的有苦臉，笑臉，應尬的搶——</p>
<h3>黎明</h3>
<p>— 梅雨</p>
<p>急落的隕星，</p>
<p>裂破了黑暗的圍牆</p>
<p>黑暗的鞭子，</p>
<p>抽起了燦爛的太陽。</p>
<p>尖急的汽笛，</p>
<p>是成千萬人的歡呼</p>
<p>破舊的麻鞋，</p>
<p>踏上了嶄新的泥土。</p>
<h3>名譽老婆婆（五）</h3>
<p>— 江馬修作任鈞譯</p>
<p>日俄戰爭爆發了。勇造所隸屬的師團馬上就實行出征。燒飯老婆婆把勇這出征時寫來的僧跑來跑去的掌給大衆看。信裏的大意是這樣的：「從今以後我要當一個國家的名譽軍人去赴戰了：就是死，我也决不死得不成樣子，在沒有盡量把正義人道之敵打倒以前，我是不肯死去的。所以，請母親也不要愁　不展地過於擔心，祇要祈求你的兒子能够在戰塲憂英勇地作堂堂的活動。」這完全充滿了不愧爲軍人的壯健的精神和勇氣。老婆婆把它拿給大家看，還要人家一遍又一遍地念給她聽。並且，每次她都深深地嘆息幾回，好像不勝感慨般的發出呻吟的聲首；接着，她還流着眼淚，說着話，對她的能幹的兒子加以最大的稱讚。</p>
<p>到處都祇是談論着戰爭。老頭子和小孩子也儘是　着戰爭的事情。接着，日本軍柑海上，陸上都連戰連勝。人們都感到昂奮，狂熱。他們全體都變成了瘋狂的軍國主義者。而艮在市鎭和鄕村裏面都充滿了萬歲和歡呼的聲音。</p>
<p>燒飯老婆婆自然也不會是個例外。無論在什麽地方，如果有着兩三價人聚在那兒談論着戰爭的事情，她就會把工作放下，仲頭探腦去打聽。而且，拼命想要知道戰爭的狀况和經過。實際上，沒有好久她就記到了滿州的各種地名，各師團長的名字，和戰術上的用語；並且開始由自己對人家講起戰爭的事情來了。但是，全然沒有聽慣的話語究竟太多了，使她時常弄出奇奇怪怪的錯誤來，這是沒有辦法的事情。例如把烏拉爵斯特克念做烏拉濟洛斯特北，把地雷火念做地雷也，把旅順口念做羅順口，把牛莊念做久莊……等等。對於她，只有一個聽過一回就可以輕易地記牢的地名，那就是南山。據她說，這發音跟難產兩個字是相同的。</p>
<p>『什麼，俄國鬼五萬十萬莫得什麼鳥。我的兒子一個人就是以對付。他們大概不　得日本軍裏有我的兒子勇造在吧。」</p>
<p>她表現出凄厲的神氣這麽說着。說過之後，就突然哈哈哈地大笑起來。</p>
<p>旅順口的攻擎開始了。屬於我們地方上的師團也實行參加。於是，在和平的鄉村裏，就攻第得到了戰死者和負傷者的通知。</p>
<p>『今天又得到了某街的某某君的戰死的通知！』</p>
<p>「聽說某某也負了重傷！』</p>
<p>「名譽的戰死，名譽的負傷！」</p>
<h3>回憶過去</h3>
<p>— 歐陽凡海</p>
<p>在大多數知識階級的眼睛裏，過去好像是美麗的仙景。他們如果聽到鄉下老太婆說一代不如一代，那他們一定覺得那老太婆不過黄守舊的人罷了，但他們就是在夢裏也沒有想到，原來在本質上，他們也正和老太婆一樣是在憧憬着過去的美夢。他們之所以把過去認爲那麽好的，實際上完全是基因於他們對將來是失望，對現在是厭惡的緣故。</p>
<p>對現狀的不滿，原來有兩種人，一種是對現狀不滿，因而追懷過去，覺得越古代越好，小孩時代比少年時代好，少年時代此靑年時代好，靑年時代又比中年時代好；或者小學比中學好，中學比大學好，大學比進了社會又好。他們對不滿的現狀，也是滿腔悲憤，好像前淸的拔買看見兒子穿了西裝便氣得搥胸跺脚，因而想到往年，腦後掛着辮的光榮日子，偵不禁暗然落淚了。他們對將來是絕望的，只覺得一天天向着深淵走下去；弗諾伊德曾經扳起面孔來說明人類有一種懷念母親胎內生活的精神反映，變成一種美麗的山泉風景或草原水色還原到夢中，這個學說引用到這裏，完全失去了莊嚴，變成專門是嘲笑人似的了。</p>
<p>另外一種對現狀不滿的却不是這樣。他們厭恨現在，但他們知道有一個比現在好的將來會要來的，對這個將來，他們抱着無限的希望，他們發生美的憧憬，在這裏他們找到安慰，或者他們死心塌地醉心於這個將來的美夢之實現而對過去甚至無暇顧及了。然而他們决不是不回憶過去的，可是他們的回憶方法却完全吶樣。他們决不是爲了羨慕過去或追懷過去，以爲過去好留連而去回憶過去，不，他們如果回憶過去，一定有一種目的意識，而且遭種目的意識是非常明確而界綫淸楚的，那便是去分折過去，分辨出過去的各種不同的存在，從而在過去中學取可爲現在所川的經騐。這差不多是近於科學的研究的。除此理由之外，他們沒有功夫到回過去。他們爲了追求未來是足够忙着要抓住現在的。</p>
<p>在前著的眼裏，過去一切醜惡的成分是全被排除，只剩下一片醉人的五光十色的。用這片醉人的景色，他們當作給自己喝的酒，沈迷在那裏面消度日益沒落下去的有閒生活。</p>
<p>在後者的眼睛裏，過去的醜惡與美麗是同時並存的。它僅僅是人類過程或自己過程的一段，他們對這一段看一眼的時候就必須問一聲化費了現在的時間到底掉得了多少過去的認識來造益未來？緊隨市民階級的發生，希臘羅馬的古典全被回憶出來加以認識了，而這個回憶完全是為的那光明燦爛的古典主義的前途。遲於法國大革命之後的各國的市民階級在其勃與時，把法國大革命後的一切改革全回想出來而照樣模造的當時是充滿着欣欣向榮的少年氣魄的。他們對於這些過去不曾白化過半點時間，當他們把道些過去從各方面研究完了之後，他們毫無感覺似的恬然回到自已的工作室去了。</p>
<p>但是法國王政復古時代的貴族們却不同了。他們看着那葉已改了形的莊園，變了性格的農人，回憶着從前路易時代，想到滂波王朝，每天便是以眼淚洗面度着餘生的了。他們把過去當作一種食糧，只有過去是他們的靈魂唯一能逃避的王國。這情形，反映在浪漫主義對中古的憧憬中是大有斷陽之槪的。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>迷信品的消費</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>破除迷信，在中國，今日還辦不到。一因迷信原是一種因襲思想，由悠遠的古代，一直遞傳下來的，非一朝所能改變。二因迷信勢力，在一般民間，已是根深蒂固，也非一朝所能解除。然而迷信究竟是一種有害的東西，它的存在，對於民族的發展，有莫大的阻礙。故迷信思想，雖一時不易破除。設法防止其傳布，及使其逐漸消滅，當是必要的。</p>
<p>這裏暫且撇開迷信給予精神上及行爲上的影響不提，單從經濟方面的損失看，也很足驚人，據閩省府所調査，全省迷信品消費，年在五百五十餘萬元。以一省的迷信品消費，年達五百五十餘萬元，這數目已不算小。若就全國各省合計起來，全國迷信品消費，每年當有一萬萬元（至少也有七八千萬元），這更是一個如何龐大的數字。在民生凋敝的中國，大部分國民，日常衣食生活，尙虞不能維持。每年再加這重大的負擔，其困苦情形，可以想見。這問題該是値得注意。</p>
<p>然而閩省府對於民問這項無謂的損失，旣無法使其减輕，今又將從而舉辦迷信特捐。這措施是否適當，實有檢討的餘地。據報載，閩省通過財政設計委會呈送擬辦迷信特捐案，按全省迷信品消費，年在五百五十餘萬元，以百分之三十課稅，年約有百十餘萬元，閩省府舉辦這種迷信特捐，這在當局稅收方面，年可增加百十餘萬元，未始非一宗鉅大的收入。但是這百十餘萬元的課稅，將從什麼地方得來呢？直接是從製造迷信品的商人，間接是從消費迷信品的人民。這樣，閩省每年本來五百五十餘萬元的迷信品消費，現在便要加多百十餘萬元，而成爲六百六十餘萬元。這於人民方面，却是一個更重的担負。</p>
<p>或者有人說，迷信旣應破除，舉辦迷信特捐，正是一種寓禁於徵的方法，實也未可非難。我以爲這話是不一定對的。用寓禁於徵的方法，來解除這迷信。無異用寓禁於徵的方法，來肅淸鴉片。這只能使迷信更爲猖獗。我們果有决心破除迷信，必須一方以敎育的力量，去改變人民的思想。他方禁止迷信品的製造，使人民無從應用。能如是，我國迷信，卽一時不能破除。逐漸消滅，當非不可能。</p>

<h3>旅店之夜</h3>
<p>— 憶夏</p>
<p>天氣熱到九十度以上，樹梢上連最細的枒枝也不稍擺動。一張長方形的矮桌上，燃着一盞煤油燈。爲着要使火熖格外亮些，反而把玻璃罩被煤烟薰黑了，因之屋內籠罩了一層分外的幽暗。幾張過了時的報紙攤在桌子上，除掉幾個標題的大字外，別的很難認得清楚。</p>
<p>離開故鄉已經有半個年頭了，出來時正穿着皮衣，現在是什麼都變了，這年頭兒，隨時隨地會給你出乎意外的變化。在旅途中，到處聽到水災的消息，從長江一直到黃河，從黃河一直到運河淮水，到處是水的消息，到處是死人的統計，到處是救災的宣傳。但是你沒有方法知道真確的消息，大家在搖着頭，大家在嘆着氣。在都市裏，大家在忙着，誰都會說出洪水的可怕，災情的慘重。似乎是整個中國已經陸沉了。雖則水還不曾追到我的脚跟，追到你的脚跟，可是，大家在惶惑着，大家浸沒在不景氣的洪流中。</p>
<p>然而，你沒有方法知道你欲知的消息。你可以從報紙上找到統計，你知道水有多少高，田淹了多少，損失了多少萬：你更可以找畫報上看到圖像，看到災民的羣。但是你仍舊不曾找到你所欲知的消息。</p>
<p>朋友，故鄉已經埋葬在洪流的底下，這是我知道的，你也知道的。可是，這年頭兒，變化是太多了，太快了，我不是要知道這泛然的消息，我想知道得更多些，更切實些。</p>
<p>我知道我的熟知的故鄉。那裏有青高的天，黃白的地，蜿蜒的曲徑。在我離開它的辰光，草正枯黃了，平舖在地上，麥苗瀰漫在山脚下，是美麗的，雄偉的一個山鄉。</p>
<p>現在是初秋，該是青蒼的草茵把整個故鄉裝點着的時候了。白楊的葉發着光，在山坡上閃爍着，柿子紅了，棗子也熟了。尤其是山坡下，白楊林中的關帝廟。那都是我們熟知的。</p>
<p>我知道圍子，知道圍子的土牆，我知道土牆上每年重生的油綠的草。我更知道這草上每年在初秋時候所結的子；那是個鮮紅可愛的細小的東西。</p>
<p>白楊樹的葉快要隨着秋的到來而轉黃紅色了。紅色的關帝廟的牆，紅色的草的種子，紅色的白楊的葉，是小孩子們沉醉的秋天。尤其是收穫的時候，是遍野農歌的時候。</p>
<p>還有我們的家，我們的家裏的人，以及鄰居。</p>
<p>可是，現在是變了，一切都迅速地變了。</p>
<p>我們知道水到處在泛濫着，從長江到黃河。每個人都惶惑着，大家都在搖着頭嘆着氣。在都市裏，大家都在忙着。在忙着救災，在嘆着這年頭兒變化得太多，在驚惶着這不景氣的洪流。</p>
<p>已經是初秋了，天氣這樣熱。煤油燈的玻璃罩愈加是昏沉沉的。三天前從都市裏帶來的報紙，雖則是陳舊了，可還是惟一新鮮的消息。</p>
<p>在黝暗的煤油燈光下，逐個逐個字認着，不顧滿身的汗，不顧蚊蟲的貪食，把報紙翻了又翻。</p>
<p>故鄉是怎樣了？白楊的葉，關帝廟的牆，以及草的種子。還有家，我們的家，家人，以及鄰居。</p>
<p>報紙上這樣載着……載着田地，房屋，災民，損失的種種統計。</p>
<h3>九盤子（續）</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>這，在我們間投下了一個巨烈的炸彈，我們意會到他所以不說話的原因，也意會到伕子們的靜寂。</p>
<p>—怎麼對付呢？這成了我們全體共同的要求。「啣枚急走」，當然是一個好辦法，但，倘若不能如願的時候怎樣呢？於是，我們茫然了。</p>
<p>不知怎麼，忽然的　想起了舊小說上的綠林英雄，由舞台上出現的樣子連想到彪形怒目，粗眉大眼，薄底快靴，連想到大喝一聲攔住去路，鋼刀起過人首異處，更想到吼聲如雷，震動山岳，……凡是自己所能想像的樣子都儘量的搬上了腦府，爲什麼要這樣的想呢？不知道，總覺得非這樣不可。</p>
<p>據說當一個人心緒不寗的時候，神經上的靈覺是非常敏銳的，這話在今天被實騐了，山那頭捲來了一陣馬鈴聲，在心里就會震動一下，樹上的葉子多響幾下甚至過路的人向我們多看幾眼，也都能引起了我們的仇視，想到另外的一個境地去。</p>
<p>大沙溝在不經意里過去了，九盤子緊立在眼前—</p>
<p>揑了一把心，頭頂上冒着冷汗，悄悄地放輕了脚步走着，老黃老魏，他們幾個把帶來的武器緊握在手里，看看天，日頭被烏雲掩住，時間是將近六時了。</p>
<p>天，彷彿有意和我們作對，在緊要的關頭，牠偏陰暗得很可怕，那遠處蠕動的有些什麼東西，不能猜想，也看不清楚。</p>
<p>跨上了九盤子的山頭，不知是什麼緣故，前面的伕子在伕頭的引導之下高喊着他們的行話，像一條長蛇，在樹叢掩映的羊腸山道上，別具有一番情趣。</p>
<p>什麼道理？不必管牠，老張的機智我們是知道的，好，我們也且高唱吧！</p>
<p>於是，我們唱着不入調的山歌，拉長了喉嚨，餘音在羣山包圍中繚繞着。</p>
<p>穿過一遍傾斜的山坡，到了山頂，向四下里張望一下，山携了手拉成了一個圓圈，當中呢，便成了大的深谷，隨便你是由那一面走上來的，在你沒有走到頂點的時候，你斷不會意會到深谷里所做的勾當，呼援嗎？不用想，事實上根本沒有方法追尋到你的踪跡，假使你不是痴傻，也絕不會如此而獲得那不幸的結果。</p>
<p>天怪暗淡的，看上去今天夜里保不住要下雨，山待的人們，對於這並不希奇，在瘴氣凝結的地方，天時是靠不住的。澗流，風嘯，雖能增加了自然間的情趣，但這，我們沒有餘閒去領略了。</p>
<p>——呵？我們該是多麽繳倖呵！下了山，深深地吁了一口氣。</p>
<p>時間，指在六時上，張伕頭漲紅了臉，從前面跑過來說——</p>
<p>——糟糕，天太晚了，遠的他方趕不上，今天非歇在觀音橋不行。</p>
<p>——快些走！喂，落棧到觀音橋！</p>
<p>下山容易上山難，這樣，我們在上燈以前落了棧，由棧里人的傳說，我們知道這地方是險要的去處，我們知道單身的行旅常常地逼上犧牲的路，我們也知道在二三點鍾之前，這裏也有人受了不幸的遭遇。</p>
<p>——附近的地方不要去觀望呵！夜裏要多小心呵！老張再三的囑咐。</p>
<p>吃晚飯的時候，照樣有許多的人圍過來看，他們的頭上，也照樣纏了帕子，可是，在我們的眼中，總覺得他們是懷了鬼胎，充滿了殺肅。</p>
<p>夜了，四下里都是靜寂的，聽着風蕭蟲鳴，我們的心是被不安定的空氣包圍着，忐忑着。</p>
<p>——什麽時候天明呢？這難過的時候呵！</p>

<p>電影界助賑遊藝會三天的日期已過去了，我不知道除了「菲酌」「茶點」等開支之外，尙有賑欵若干？災民們受賜於電影界遊藝助賑的又若干？</p>
<p>遊藝會第三天據說是最「生意興隆」的一天，但是當我退出大滬花園時，見到滿地是黃色的優待券廢票，我不知道災民能受實惠者，究竟有多少也？</p>
<p>助賑遊藝會而發優待券，本來巳是笑話，而優待券發得如此許多，寗非更笑話中之笑話？</p>
<p>難道，已經忘了這是助賑遊藝會了嗎？</p>

<h3>「凱歌」與「識字運動」</h3>
<p>— 白木</p>
<p>自政府頒佈了「識字運動」以來，於是掃除文盲的呼聲，便充滿了全國，各地敎育機關及有志人士紛起組織或設立識字學校，而在政府的指導下，從事於「識字運動」工作，期達掃除文盲之目的。</p>
<p>記者昨天路過金司徒廟，聞有「小小狗小小貓」之讀書聲發自藝，一時好奇心動進內觀看，則見攝影塲中建有學堂一所，校門口橫邊懸有「農民子弟小學」字樣招牌一塊。</p>
<p>是時腦海中，忽然想起了目前正風起雲湧的「識字運動，」我便以為藝華公司也辦起識字學校來了啦，但是進內一看，原來他們是在拍戲，據說這是卜萬蒼先生導演的「凱歌」中的一幕。我發現了飾敎員的魏鶴齡，更在許許多多的大人小人的農民學生中發現了王引。王引正為着關於旱災向魏鶴齡發着疑問，兩人之間，因着科學（水蒸氣）及迷信（龍王廟）問題的衝突而展開着舌戰。結果是魏鶴齡的有根據的科學常識的話屈服了王引，因為空氣的處理得適當，所以我感到了非常的興奮，我以為「凱歌」問世之日，對於農村識字運動，該是有很大的帮助力量吧？</p>
<h3>出版界</h3>

<h3>談三輪汽車的特長</h3>
<p>— 虞</p>
<p>自從汽車行世以來。一般人的心目中。都以爲汽車不造則已。如果要製造汽車。那末車子上的四個輪盤。是天經地義的。不能多。也不能少。可是這種思想。在另有一班匠心獨運的人看起來。未必盡然。他們好像現有的五〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇汽車使用人。在思想上未免過於傳統。因之在近幾年來。苦心研究之下。發現汽車的輪盤。最好用三個。不但他們的理想如此。更有幾個汽車製造工程師。專門爲三輪汽車設計。他們不管這種三輪汽車能否流行市上。總覺得這種汽車另有它不可磨滅的長處。</p>
<p>三輪汽車的爲人注意。尙係極短暫時間中的事實。所以這種車輛的數量。可以說是極微細的。據目下調査。約有十多種不同的式樣發現在歐洲。至於在中國呢。可說是還沒有這種三輪汽車。所有的不過是一種三個輸盤的機器脚踏車罷了。這種機器脚踏車。大多用爲運送輕巧物件的。</p>
<p>在美國的少數三輪客車。近年有一種是勃克敏斯德勒的「逕麥與」。對於三輸汽車的優長各點。可說包括無遺。其最顧著的。（一）卓越的流綫。（二）運用的靈便。（三）份量減輕。這車是一種大型汽車。車廂中很爲寬暢。而它的重量却祇有三·〇〇〇磅。用一個福特引擎來發動。每小時能行一百英里。而它能在路旁。祗有像它車身般長短的空隙地位停靠。駕車者可以開動前輪。而轉撥它的後輸。如果在一個緊束狹少的地位停放。那末駕車的人。可以先把車的前端開進去。把後輸轉到八十度角的地位。然後開動機力於前。而把車後端轉進去。這車的兩個寬暢客座。位置在引擎的前面。講到它車輪的排列方法。倒像一輛三輪脚踏車向後開行着。而它的運用靈便。也和三輪脚踏車相仿。有些人說。這種車子的靈便眞是他們從來沒有見過的。</p>
<p>爲什麽人家對於三輪汽車的興味。漸漸的濃厚而高漲呢。這里不妨將其原因酌要說一說。我們如果回溯到以前的日子。當時的道路還是全用泥土來鋪築的。車子在地面上一走。便留下兩條車轍。因之汽車的車輪。不得不跟了車轍而製造。美北方的馬拖車輛接軌面約五六·五英寸。南方爲六〇英寸。所以早期製造的汽車。要隨着買主的需要。在兩者之間。揀着一個尺寸來裝置。現在雖然還有若干的泥土路留存着。可是大多數的道路都是改成硬面的了。汽車輪的能否與車轍吻合。當然不成問題哩。</p>
<p>三輪汽車另外的一個優點。便是流綫化。所謂流綫這個名詞。目下大家已經用濫了。嚴正的講起來。現在一般汽車的所謂流綫也者。不過得其形似。和一些皮毛。不過還有些人以爲汽車卽使做到準流綫化。它的優益如何。也不敢十分確定。現在且把一個準流綫型的形狀說一說。我們如果把一尾正型的魚一剖爲兩。那末上半部便成爲一個流綫型。最闊的横梁部是近於前頭的。而尾端却是尖削的。在外形上一些也不能有突塊。以保它的光潤流利。車輪一定要包起來。車頭燈，擋泥板，等。也必須與車身化爲一致的形態。如果這個樣子爲合於流綫型的話，那末這個汽車一定是要三輪的了。因爲在尾部是沒有兩個輪盤的地位。風聲的减少。燃料經濟和加速力的增進。都是流綫型車的特長。至於速度的增加。更是不在話下。</p>
<p>講到車身的外形。一般人都以爲三輸的較四輸的要美觀得多了。更有一班人說。除了三輸車外。竟然沒有汽車可以趕得上它美化的姿態的。關於重量减輕問題。那末人各有說了。有些人說三輪汽車所需的重量。及不到習見汽車的一半。這個說數確實與否。現在且不表述。單就普通的知識來講。三輸汽車的重量。不至於超過四輪車的四分之三。三輪車的車身可用一張圓錐形的金屬片來製造。這種金屬片質量輕而堅牢。和單葉飛機的身骨架相彷彿。因之三輪汽車的重量。當然不致過份的重了。</p>
<p>三輪汽車的製造成本。據說比了普通汽車大爲低减。不但因爲它重量輕的緣故。並且爲了車身配製簡單。費用亦就减少很多。各種嵌板等。可以在不過於花費的棍轉機上製造。不樣現在流行的汽車。一定要在鑄模重壓等機器上製造。成本非常之貴的。關於製造上的重要問題像引擎的式樣，地位，重量支配。機力管理等等。一時尙不能解决妥蕃。不過那一班硏究三輸汽車製造的機師們。相信重力的中心。如果是一輛輪距一百二十五吋的汽車。必須要在前軸後二十時至三十吋間。那末三輪汽車行駛間之安全。可較四輪者更爲增進。因爲這車的轉向祇用一個輪盤。所有習遇的前端問題。就可泯除了。引擎的地位。可隨了各種不同的重量支配而變化。坐位的分配也跟了引擎地位而酌定。</p>
<p>右圖爲堅强之福特貨車行於甘肅附近沙漠中之景况，按我國西北內地，或沙漠綿互，或山陵起伏，或河川氷結，此種情形之下，福特貨車對於交通運輸，頗多驚人之紀錄。</p>
<h3>汽車用狄塞爾引擎發展史（一）</h3>
<p>— 朱義生</p>
<p>原狄塞爾引擎在歐美各國之所以亟於普及。厥因有四。（一）狄塞爾引擎可燃燒價格較廉之重油。同尋常用汽油幾一與三之比。（二）不裝化油器。不受天寒冰凍影響。（三）廢却累贅笨重之打火塞蓄電池及馬運等。（四）重油非若輕質汽油。着火時易於燃燒。在安全上平添了許多的保障。</p>
<p>就近來幾月前。有一架克敏斯式的六缸狄塞爾跑車。由紐約啟程横斷新大嚴面至加利福尼州之老聖及城。歷程三千七百七十四英里。然而那引秦所消耗去的重油。祗値美金七元六角三分。約合我國銀洋十六元。是每行駛百英里祗燃燒値價四分許之重油。可謂開汽車事業用油之新紀錄矣。</p>
<p>世界機器工程學家對於狄塞爾引擎之效用。固早已於歡十年之前抱有絕大的希望。所以遲至今日方謀發展者。因那時間媒炭出產多而價格廉。水汀引擎又便於製造。無多事更張及節省之必要。乃今者商戰日烈。尤其是在不景氣籠罩之下。對於消耗勢不得不力求其撙節。於是而狄塞爾引擎尙矣。時至今日。舉凡流綫型火車也。汽車也。郵船也。飛機也。莫不亟與改良。競相裝置狄塞爾引擎。其他如水電廠也。耕田機也。全工廠用原動力也。莫不逐漸採用狄塞爾引擎。目下我國機器工廠亦能模仿自製。用於抽水碾米軋花等小工業。但我國出品。因冶金術之低下。機器傢具之粗劣。推算術之不講究。尙未能同舶來品爭一日之長短。况其爲汽車及飛機用之引擎乎</p>
<p>在去年祗美州合衆一國。各機器廠製成的狄塞爾引擎。總馬力有七十五萬匹之鉅。預計今年可以加倍。凡是向來製造汽油引擎的工廠。現在莫不另闢專部。硏究狄塞爾引擎的製造。在過去的十二個月中。各種的改良有突飛猛進之勢。爲世界原動力界創一新紀錄。</p>
<p>狄塞爾引擎之所以較他式引擎爲經濟於其效率之偉大。譬如幾月之前歐州某大機器工廠。造成具有五千五百匹馬力之大引擎一座。經試騐結果。其效率爲百分之四十一。（就是說譬如加進去一百磅的重油。實際祗有四十一磅是發生效力的。）較之水汀透平之百分之二十一。汽油引擎之百分之一十。火車水汀引擎之百分之六。高勝遠矣。</p>
<p>狄塞爾引幣旣具有如許優點。爲何不早日普及。其原因前叚已約略述及。茲更從製造及運用各難題上伸而說之。</p>
<h3>炎熱天氣中福特駕駛舒適</h3>
<p>新式福特V八汽車之精美化。使夏季汽車駕馳成爲異乎尋常之舒服。所以然者。福特車身通氣系。實爲主要因素之一。此外尙有單獨控制可以調節之屏風。寬大隔膜之轅蓋通風器。以及車窗通氣之設備。當氣熱如焚之時節。車窗。屛風。及轅蓋通風器。均可全部啟開。俾大量空氣得入車中。而尋常時令則可先開轅蓋通風器。倘入夜氣候轉冷。或有微雨。則可關閉轅蓋通風器。而開車窗通氣縫。俾車中濁氣徐由此縫洩出。然後放入新鮮空氣。毫無隙風之侵入。</p>
<p>尙有一種新增「導流」式引擎換氣設置。雖在最困難之炎夏情形之下。亦能增進引擎寒冷之運用。所有從引擎風扇面來之一道氣流。被吸入孔穴之中。下行經過一導管而入拐盒中。再向上流入汽門室。然後更由出氣孔洩出。隨管水質及其他蒸氣。俾引擎油之得以冷却。並防免油於高速度夏季運用之變壞。</p>
<p>V八引擎之設計。使每排四只汽缸俱有各別之水　筒一套。因此確保水之流通迅速而準確。每只汽缸完全由水套包圍。遍及其全長度。因此雖於嚴厲運用情形之下。亦得防免「熱點」及汽缸之歪曲。</p>
<p>新車型之籌鼓。為防衛車支受熱度之影響起見。外部加制肋骨。以增加其射熱面積與堅強。如此則雖屢屢刹車。亦可免車掣之「衰弱」。因屢屢停車。每足使掣鼓澎漲。因而减小車掣之效序也</p>
<p>汽車駕駛人每注意於駕駛時之絕少用力。關於此點。一九三五年之福特V八。則因其傳力盒動作之較爲柔軟而效率更大。實爲一確實之助力。此新傳力盆。利用離心力作用。使嚙合更爲確定。而於放鬆嚙合時所需之踏板壓力更大爲减少。每當夏季如欲汽車漆水之光彩閃目。則非常常淸潔不可。惟福特車則因探用新式烘磁漆之完成。故更易滿足此種願望。此項完成。雖在夏天太陽極强光綫之下。亦不發生變化。祗須加以冲洗卽能光彩如初矣。</p>

<h3>A Groundbreaking Event in the League of Nations' History: Unanimous Vote by the Council; Italy Violates Treaty and Initiates Conflict; Both Committee Reports Passed; The Council Remains Prepared to Sponsor Conciliation; General Assembly to Discuss Sanctions Today</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council today unanimously ruled that Italy has morally placed itself outside the community of civilized nations and has been declared to have violated a most solemn treaty by engaging in warfare. Other member states of the League of Nations have finally agreed to sever all commercial and financial relations with any country that violates the League's covenants and to prohibit all communication. During today's Council meeting, when the chairman asked each council member whether they agreed to censure Italy in this manner, each responded in the affirmative. The atmosphere in the meeting hall was deeply moving. The Italian representative, Aloisi, appeared visibly worried from beginning to end. After the vote was finalized, he flicked his cigarette and made a witty remark to French Prime Minister Laval, revealing a smile, truly a smile of a brave loser. The League of Nations Council's decision to implement Article 16 of the Covenant to deal with a member state that has violated the League is the first time in the League's history. The second step will now be carried out by the League of Nations General Assembly, which is scheduled to meet tomorrow to approve the Council's decision and form a committee to handle the economic plans necessary to implement sanctions. The committee's first task is to develop an economic sanctions plan, which will likely include severing diplomatic, but not consular, relations and rescinding the ban on arms shipments to Abyssinia. The issue of a blockade will not arise immediately, but if more moderate plans prove ineffective, this issue will undoubtedly be considered. The Council also passed the report of the Thirteen-Nation Committee, with only the Italian representative voting against it. Chairman Wang continued, stating that the first necessity is to cease hostilities. The Council is still at the disposal of those assisting Italy and Abyssinia in reaching any possible peaceful solution, and is proceeding with all efforts in that regard. In addition to passing the report of the Thirteen-Nation Committee today, the Council also passed the report of the Six-Nation Committee, which identified Italy as the aggressor in this war and blamed it for violating the League of Nations Covenant. Aloisi delivered a speech opposing this report and reserved the right to present his views later. After the vote was finalized, the chairman solemnly announced that the fourteen member states of the League of Nations had voted to determine that a state of war now exists, regardless of Article 12 of the Covenant. Each member must now consider fulfilling the obligations listed for sanctioners under Article 16 of the Covenant. Those who wish to fulfill their responsibilities as members cannot disregard such obligations. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council, by a vote of thirteen to one, confirmed Italy as the aggressor in the East African war and passed a resolution on sanctions against Italy. Only Italy voted against it, but according to the League of Nations Covenant, the opposing vote of a party to the dispute is not sufficient to change the resolution, so the decision to invoke sanctions can be said to have been unanimously passed in technical terms. The Council confirmed that the Italian military initiated the conflict, directly violating Article 12 of the Covenant. The Council's decision automatically invokes Article 16 of the Covenant. The sanctions will be decided on Wednesday when the League of Nations General Assembly passes the Council's report, and a committee will be formed to study the legal aspects of the issue. Some observers here believe that the United States may be invited to send observers to participate in the committee. It is noteworthy that although the Council's decision only binds the thirteen countries, in fact, each member state of the League of Nations is expected to announce the same decision in the General Assembly. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to reliable sources here, the sanctions against Italy will be based on the principles contained in the resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly in October 1921. This resolution stipulates (1) the severing of diplomatic relations, but not consular relations; (2) the restriction of postal, railway, and other communications; (3) economic sanctions, such as restricting the export of military raw materials to Italy and restricting the import of Italian goods. It is reported that if the above measures cannot restrain Italy, the League of Nations will consider a blockade, jointly carried out by various countries or by one or two countries under the League's orders. However, a blockade will only be used as a last resort. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Abyssinia Orders Italian Envoy to Leave Immediately</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Abyssinian representative Hawariat informed the League of Nations today that the Abyssinian government has ordered the Italian envoy to leave immediately because the Italian legation in the Abyssinian capital is a center for espionage and conspiracy, and the legation staff are plotting to undermine Abyssinian public safety. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) Because the staff of the Italian legation and consulates in Abyssinia can no longer reside in Abyssinia, the Italian government has inquired with the Belgian government whether the staff of the Belgian legation in Abyssinia can act on its behalf in diplomatic affairs. The Belgian government is said to have replied to Italy that it could not do so without the consent of the British and French governments. The Italian government has therefore requested that the British and French governments negotiate with the Belgian ambassador to Britain or the British ambassador to Belgium to persuade the Belgian government. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>Details of Important Meeting of the League of Nations Council; Italian Request to Postpone Meeting Denied; Abyssinian Representative Declares Resistance to the End</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council met this afternoon, lasting less than two hours. This was not only the most important resolution since the founding of the League of Nations, but also broke the speed record for the League's work in terms of the progress of its deliberations. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>At 1:50 PM today, the Secretariat of the League of Nations released the report submitted to the Council by the Six-Nation Committee, which concluded that "Italy has violated Article 12 of the League of Nations Covenant and is engaged in war." At 4:30 PM, the Italian representative Aloisi requested the Council to postpone public discussion of the report. The Council then convened a closed meeting at 4:45 PM. With the exception of the Italian representative, all member states of the Council were present. It was decided that the Council would reject the Italian representative's request and proceed with the original procedure, immediately discussing the Six-Nation Committee's report and determining Italy's war responsibility.</p>
<p>At 5:45 PM, the Council held a public meeting in a tense atmosphere. All member states of the Council, including representatives from both Italy and Abyssinia, attended the meeting, chaired by Argentine representative Quenazzi. Initially, Italian representative Aloisi spoke, offering a lengthy criticism of the Six-Nation Committee's report, stating that the Italian government had to present the strongest reservations regarding the report, including the following points: (1) Comparing Italy's position on Abyssinia with that of other countries was a complete disregard for the facts. In fact, Abyssinia's unrelenting spirit of aggression was specifically directed at Italy, forcing Italy to take defensive measures. (2) Although the report clearly acknowledges that the Abyssinian local authorities have not implemented the various reforms decided by the Emperor, in other words, acknowledging that Abyssinia lacks internal organization, the opinions presented in the Italian memorandum have still not been considered properly. (3) The Six-Nation Committee's report refuses to conduct a thorough study of the Abyssinian slave problem, but in reality, the existence of the Abyssinian slave system is generally acknowledged. If so, this is tantamount to acknowledging that a state that violates the fundamental principles of humanity and justice should be allowed to continue to exist. The Six-Nation Committee should be held responsible for this. (4) The report accuses Italy of delaying the submission of the memorandum until September 4. In fact, before September 4, Italy was awaiting the results of the arbitration of the Wal Wal incident, so it did not formally present documents condemning Abyssinia. As for Italy's repeated dispatch of troops to East Africa, this was due to the increasingly serious military actions on the Abyssinian side. Moreover, Italy's military preparations were carried out openly. All Italian troops passing through the Suez Canal were inspected by the Suez Canal Authority. Aloisi concluded by saying, "If we now place Abyssinia among civilized countries based on various abstract principles, all discussions will be futile and meaningless."</p>
<p>Abyssinian representative Hawariat then spoke, stating that Abyssinia fully agrees with the report of the Thirteen-Nation Committee. Abyssinia reaffirms that it is prepared to consider the recommendations made by the Council. He also stated that the arbitration committee for the Wal Wal incident had determined that Abyssinia had no responsibility. Moreover, Italy repeatedly smuggled arms into various parts of Abyssinia, attempting to incite internal unrest. Now that the Six-Nation Committee's report has declared Italy responsible for the war, Abyssinia considers this completely satisfactory. "The war has caused Italy and Abyssinia to suffer equally, but the war cannot be stopped, and Abyssinia will resist to the end." At this point, the chairman of the Six-Nation Committee, Portuguese representative Monteiro, stood up and read the conclusion of the Six-Nation Committee's report in French, stating that "The Six-Nation Committee has concluded that Italy has violated the obligations stipulated in Article 12 of the League of Nations Covenant and is engaged in war." Then, Chairman Quenazzi asked the member states of the Council and the representatives of both parties to review the Six-Nation Committee's report again. Italian representative Aloisi rose again and protested the Council's failure to grant Italy's request to postpone the discussion of the report. Abyssinian representative Hawariat stated that he would await the Council's decision on everything. Finally, Chairman Quenazzi replied to Aloisi, stating, "Today is October 7, and the state of hostility between Italy and Abyssinia has lasted for five days. If the Council continues to delay its decision, it will be responsible for the expansion of the incident. However, if either party has any comments, they can still be raised during the Council meeting." Then, the chairman announced a roll-call vote. The Six-Nation Committee's report was unanimously passed by the Council. After the report was passed, the chairman officially stated that "The representatives of the fourteen countries attending the Council have agreed that the war has now begun and Article 12 of the Covenant has been violated. Therefore, the Six-Nation Committee's report and the minutes of the Council meeting passed today should be sent to all member states of the League of Nations for review. According to Article 16 of the Covenant, if a country engages in war, all member states have certain obligations. Therefore, a committee should be appointed by the League of Nations General Assembly to adjust the various measures taken in accordance with Article 16 of the Covenant. The League of Nations General Assembly is now scheduled to convene this Wednesday." The chairman finished his speech, and the entire hall was silent. The atmosphere was unusually solemn. The Council adjourned at 7:30 PM. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>Secretariat of the League of Nations Arranges General Assembly Procedures Based on the 16th Article Amendment</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations General Assembly is scheduled to meet tomorrow afternoon, chaired by Czech Foreign Minister Beneš. The Secretariat has prepared the agenda for the General Assembly this morning, as well as a list of candidates for the Sanctions Committee. This committee will be organized by representatives of the member states preparing to implement sanctions. Other member states that oppose sanctions will be allowed not to participate in the work and will be allowed to postpone the implementation of sanctions, but only to the extent that it does not hinder the success of the League of Nations' overall plan. Once the Sanctions Committee submits its recommendations, the Council will notify the member states of the implementation date. This method is not without legal basis. Regarding the 16th Article of the Covenant, although all member states have an equal obligation to participate in sanctions in principle, the protocol amending the 16th Article of the Covenant on October 5, 1921, amended the fourth section of this article and stipulated that "If the Council believes that, for the sake of a member, postponing the implementation of any of these measures for a specified period of time will facilitate the attainment of the purpose of the measures mentioned in the preceding section, or if it believes that such postponement is necessary to reduce the losses or inconvenience suffered by the member, the Council shall have the power to decide on such postponement." Therefore, the Council is clearly recognized by this amendment to allow certain member states to vary the measures. As for the British government's mobilization of the navy, which is related to sanctions, the Council seems to approve it. Regarding economic sanctions, the countries concerned will soon hold negotiations. French Foreign Ministry Commercial Secretary Corantel arrived here this morning and will begin discussions with British expert Hodley this afternoon. Those responsible have declared that severe sanctions, such as severing diplomatic relations and blockades, will not be implemented. This sanctions plan is based on the amendment to the 16th Article of the Covenant on October 5, 1921. The purpose of this amendment is to prevent the implementation of excessively severe measures under the Covenant. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Italian representative Aloisi has reserved the right to respond to the League of Nations Council's censures of Italy at tomorrow's General Assembly meeting. Attention is now focused on the attitude taken by the representatives of Switzerland, Austria, and Hungary at tomorrow's General Assembly meeting, as economic sanctions against Italy will hurt these three countries even more than Italy. It is likely that these three countries will abstain from voting due to geographical reasons. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Italy Explores With Britain Conditions for Peace With Abyssinia; Abyssinia Insists on Prior Withdrawal</h3>
<p>(London) According to this agency's diplomatic correspondent, after Italy began military operations against Abyssinia, it explored opinions here to gauge whether there was a possible basis for peace between Italy and Abyssinia. Italy proposed dividing Abyssinia into two parts: one being the lands conquered by the country in recent years, and the other being the country's original territory. The conquered lands would be entrusted to Italian rule, and the original territory would be placed under international mandate, thus accommodating the proposal previously made by the Five-Nation Committee of the League of Nations Council. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini would be able to accept this solution. Italian sources also said that this solution is within the scope of the League of Nations, and would be easily accepted by both Geneva and London. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Abyssinian representatives have demanded that Italian troops withdraw before peace talks begin, and now intend to maintain this position. The report of the Six-Nation Committee is the basis for all future actions of the League of Nations. Legal scholars declared today that only countries that approve of sanctions are bound by the implementation of these measures regarding the League of Nations General Assembly's vote on sanctions. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<h3>Sanctions Issue Britain Contacts Germany and the United States, Asking for Joint Participation in Committee Work</h3>
<p>(London) Well-informed sources declare that British officials in Geneva are considering making proposals to Germany and the United States, inviting them to participate in the work of the Sanctions Committee. Because Germany has declared its withdrawal from the League of Nations, the dues it owes have not yet been paid. Therefore, although the 14th of this month is the date on which its withdrawal from the League takes effect, it may not actually take effect immediately. Officials say that Britain has technically considered the implementation of sanctions, such as restricting trade with Italy and rescinding the ban on arms shipments to Abyssinia, and even the possibility of severing diplomatic relations with Italy. However, it will not be implemented immediately until a collective decision is obtained in Geneva. It is expected that an agreement can be reached by the countries concerned on the sanctions plan discussed in Geneva. Foreign Minister Hoare, in view of the very favorable negotiation situation, has decided to suspend his trip to Geneva, but if the Foreign Minister must personally attend, this decision can be changed temporarily. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The main topic of discussion in political and business circles today is what action Germany will take if the League of Nations invites Germany to participate in sanctions against Italy. It is expected that the League of Nations General Assembly will inquire with Germany about this matter after it convenes tomorrow. Officials declare that Germany's reply will depend on the wording of the League of Nations' communication, but will certainly comply with Hitler's repeated declarations that Germany does not want to be involved in wars that do not concern it. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Naval Cooperation Issue France's Reply to Britain Published, Britain Not Yet Satisfied With Content</h3>
<p>(London) Britain previously asked France whether it could provide assistance if the British fleet in the Mediterranean were attacked for no reason. France has now agreed. According to its reply, Britain's suggestion, if actively adopted, can make up for the defects of the collective security system emphasized by the two governments. The obligation to assist must be mutual between Britain and France. When the political atmosphere is so tense that there is a risk that the 16th and 17th Articles of the League of Nations Covenant will be adopted, the two sides should jointly investigate the situation, and then this obligation should take effect. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French reply, in outline, was recently released by the Foreign Ministry, stating roughly that if a member state of the League of Nations is attacked for implementing sanctions against a country engaged in war, France can provide military assistance, but subject to the following conditions: (1) Military assistance must be mutual. If France guarantees to assist Britain, Britain should also make the same guarantee. (2) Whether by sea, land, or air, the mutual assistance measures should apply equally if attacked. (3) The same measures should be taken regardless of whether the aggressor is a member or non-member of the League of Nations. (4) When Britain implements sanctions in accordance with the recommendations of the League of Nations, it must consult with the French government in advance. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the French government's reply to Britain's inquiry about whether France can provide assistance if the British fleet in the Mediterranean is attacked, it does not seem to match the accident anticipated by the British government. Therefore, it is generally believed that this reply is not as satisfactory as hoped and is disappointing. The French reply states that the mutual assistance measures must be applied to any aggressor, regardless of whether it is a member of the League of Nations. This is intended to make Britain support France in the event of German aggression. It is likely that Britain will have further contacts with France to exchange views. Britain's inquiry was narrow, only mentioning a specific matter, while the French reply has a broad scope, placing Britain's inquiry about assistance on a mutual basis and expanding its scope of application. Therefore, Britain wants France to more clearly explain its attitude on several points. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<h3>Abyssinia's 500,000-Strong Army Defends Railway Line With All Its Might; Italian Troops Seek to Connect in the Southeast and Advance on Aksum City With Great Difficulty in the North</h3>
<p>Hara Abyssinian Army Front According to today's war report from here, the Abyssinian army is now firmly defending the lines in the north and south, where fierce battles continue to occur, with heavy casualties on both sides. Although the Italian army has airplanes, tanks, artillery, and machine guns, the Abyssinian army, armed with spears and sabers, has repeatedly charged and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. (National News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>Hara Abyssinian East Route Commander Nasibu told the Associated Press correspondent Atkins today that he had concentrated 150,000 soldiers in Jijiga to defend the Kinji Railway, where the fiercest battle is expected to occur. Nasibu has no illusory hopes for this war and knows that defeat is expected. However, he intends to resist valiantly to stop the advance of the Italian army. Everything in Hara city is indescribable. The narrow streets are filled with disorganized troops, and the sounds of cursing never cease. Moreover, the savage warriors from the surrounding wilderness and mountains are still arriving in droves. (National News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Rome) It was announced here today that the Italian army on the southern route has occupied the city of Dolo on the border between Italian Somaliland and British Kenya, cutting off Abyssinia's communication with the south. The city of Dolo controls three waterways. With this, the Italian army can advance westward and northwestward along the river to connect with the troops on the eastern route in the Scebeli region, who are now attacking Jijiga and Hara. (National News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>Italian Army in the North Consolidates its Front</p>
<p>(Rome) Today's communiqué announced that the Italian army in Abyssinia is now consolidating its positions outside the occupied city of Adwa and organizing communication lines. Army engineers are working hard behind the front lines to maintain the convenience of transportation. The natives in the area occupied by the Italian army are now living as usual. The communiqué also stated that the Italian army has gained many spoils of war in the past few days and has captured hundreds of enemy soldiers. The Italian army has suffered few casualties, while the enemy army has suffered heavy losses. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Although the original goal has been achieved after the Italian army captured the city of Adwa, morale is still very high, and they all want to continue to advance. The command has recently ordered that the advance be temporarily halted until food supplies arrive and that all efforts be devoted to building roads. Road construction has recently begun in the Berhale region so that the two columns can advance comfortably to a point 23 kilometers away from here. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Army Defends Against the Strong Enemy on Three Routes</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital According to non-official sources, the Abyssinian army led by General Ayelu is now rapidly entering Eritrean territory, attacking the left flank of the Italian army in the region. Another branch of the Abyssinian army is now flanking the right flank of the Italian army. A third army is holding back the advance of the Italian army in the center of the Adwa region. The famous Abyssinian leader General Qassa is now leading an army of 80,000 men on the border between Abyssinia and Eritrea, near the Setit River, about 100 miles from British Egyptian Sudan, flanking the right flank of the Italian army. General Seyoum, the governor of the Tigray region, is currently defending the main army in front of Adwa. Today's telegram reports that his troops have captured one Italian army colonel and 30 other officers. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Aksum Holy City Falls Again</p>
<p>(Rome) It was recently reported by well-informed sources that the Italian army has occupied the city of Aksum (25 kilometers west of the city of Adwa), but this has not been officially confirmed. The city of Aksum is 2,000 meters above sea level and is now the end point of the Italian army's right flank. The troops on the right flank are commanded by General Maravigna. It seems that this force captured the city of Aksum. The city is where Abyssinian emperors have held coronation ceremonies throughout the ages. In terms of historical significance, it is the most important city in Abyssinia. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital The holy city of Aksum, 20 miles west of Adwa, was captured by the Italian army today. The Italian army has now deployed a 70-mile-long battle line on the Tigray front. Officials here firmly stated that the strategy adopted by the Abyssinian army in the area is to restrain the enemy on one side and gradually retreat on the other. Aksum was once the capital of Abyssinia. After the Abyssinian people converted to Christianity in the fourth century, the area was revered as a holy site. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Officials have not yet confirmed the Italian army's capture of Aksum. Spokesmen for the Army Department and the Foreign Ministry said that they did not know that the city had fallen, as reported by the British press. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>French Troops Reinforce Key Railway Points</p>
<p>150 troops from Djibouti, French Somaliland, have been ordered to Diredawa to protect the railway operated by France from Djibouti to the Abyssinian capital. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>Emperor of Abyssinia to Personally Lead Troops; To Depart for the Front Lines in Mid-Month; Residents of the Capital City Nearly All Evacuated</h3>
<p>According to information obtained by our special correspondent, a mule train has already been formed here, ready to accompany the Emperor in the campaign. The Emperor is expected to depart for the front lines between the 12th and 23rd of this month. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Italian Embassy Staff Leave Addis Ababa</p>
<p>Foreigners in Addis Ababa are fearful of Italian air raids and are leaving the city in droves. Last night, foreigners here heard that 40 members of the Italian Embassy staff had already departed, causing a sudden panic. Immediately, 120 foreigners surrounded the train station, vying to purchase tickets for this morning's train. They believe that the departure of the Italian Embassy staff will be followed by air attacks. The train was packed with passengers. The number of foreigners leaving the city in a single day is unprecedented. Many more were unable to purchase tickets this morning and returned disappointed. Most of the foreigners leaving have been doing business here for many years. Now, for the sake of their lives, they have no choice but to abandon their businesses. Some will be ruined.

<p>According to Havas correspondent Achana in Addis Ababa, the entire population of Abyssinia is now mobilized to dig trenches for war. The capital city is almost devoid of residents. Men, women, old, and young are all heading to the nearby mountains, digging caves to avoid airplane bombings. Along the main roads, one sees Abyssinian people supporting the old and leading the young, traveling by donkey or on foot, carrying chickens, dogs, clothing, and other belongings away from the capital. Although the war has already begun, and there are rumors that Abyssinia has suffered 6,000 deaths and Italy 800, the capital remains calm. The Italian Minister to Abyssinia, Count Vinci, walked in the streets this morning, protected by Abyssinian guards. Foreign journalists personally witnessed Dr. Dagning, the Italian Vice-Consul in Debre Markos, entering the city at noon today with his wife and three members of the consulate staff. They were escorted by 30 Askaris and 40 soldiers, riding 70 donkeys, and traveled through the interior for 14 days, passing through two provinces of Abyssinia without incident. Those who saw them congratulated them. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>Respect for Foreigners; Violators Will Be Punished</p>
<p>The Abyssinian government has issued a public notice ordering residents to treat European nationals with respect. Violators will be punished to the full extent of the law. There are no Italians to be seen on the streets here. It is reported that Egyptian nationals will be repatriated by their embassy. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Request Italy Not to Conduct Aerial Bombardment (London)</p>
<p>There are currently over 6,000 foreigners residing in the Abyssinian capital, and 200 in Dire Dawa. It is reported that diplomatic representatives from various countries stationed in Abyssinia are requesting their respective governments to negotiate with the Italian government to refrain from aerial bombardment of the Abyssinian capital and Dire Dawa, so as not to harm foreigners. Political figures here believe that these negotiations should be jointly presented to the Italian government by all the countries concerned. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>Swedish Officers Wish to Serve Abyssinia (Stockholm)</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Italian-Abyssinian conflict, the Swedish government ordered Swedish officers serving in the Abyssinian government to return home. It is now reported that Swedish officers serving as military instructors in Abyssinia have requested to resign from their Swedish military positions in order to continue serving in the Abyssinian army.

<h3>Adherents of All Faiths Support Abyssinian War of National Defense</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa: According to our special correspondent Achano, the Coptic Church of the Egyptian Christian sect is now firmly supporting the Abyssinian people's war of national defense. The Archbishop of the Abyssinian region of the Coptic Church, Kirilos Abuna, told reporters that this conflict will not become a religious war, neither now nor in the future. "We consider all Christians to be brothers and sisters. The Italian people are also Catholics, yet they are attacking Abyssinia. This is a heinous crime against God's will. God will undoubtedly protect Abyssinia. We must trust in God, and with God's help, we will surely prevail." He continued, saying that the Coptic Church earnestly hopes that the waters of the Blue Nile will remain under Abyssinian control and not be taken by European countries. Therefore, it will give sincere support to Abyssinia's actions. It should be noted that the current Emperor of Abyssinia was established as Crown Prince in 1916 with the support of the Coptic Church. The Abyssinian resistance against Italy is supported not only by the Coptic Church but also by Muslims, because Muslims have hated Italy since it occupied the colonies of Tripoli and Libya in Africa. Kirilos concluded, "All the people of Abyssinia, regardless of their religion, are eager to drive the invaders out of the country." (Note: All the great bishops of Abyssinia are Egyptians. Kirilos is also an Egyptian. The title Abuna means 'priest' in Amharic.) (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>American War Correspondent's Inspection of the Aksum Front</h3>
<p>Adwa: The Italian Northern Army, having wiped away the shame of its defeat in 1896, is concentrated here today, casting a westward gaze upon Aksum, the ancient religious capital of Abyssinia, located 13 miles from here. It is the site of the tombs of the ancient kings of Abyssinia. According to General Maravigne, the commander of the Italian army here, it can be captured at any time. A United Press correspondent accompanying the army has witnessed countless Italian soldiers crossing the Mareb River in the past 24 hours, advancing day and night, building bridges and roads along the way, and reinforcing their lines, preparing to break through the Abyssinian defenses again. Machine guns, cannons, and field hospital equipment have been continuously transported here. The correspondent saw wounded soldiers for the first time: 15 Askaris and one Italian officer. While the Northern Army is organizing everything, the Italian armies in the East and South are probably attacking from the coastal border to cut off the railroad from Addis Ababa to Djibouti. At the same time, teams will be sent to the western Sudanese border and the southern British Kenya border to prevent Abyssinia from importing military supplies at the junction.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>What is Expected of Athletes Today</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>The National Games will open on Double Tenth Day. Athletes from all provinces and regions have already gathered in Shanghai, ready to show off their skills. The general public has also shifted their attention away from foreign troubles, floods, and the Italo-Abyssinian conflict, hoping to learn about the grand occasion of this event and hear about the record-breaking performances. Some are even packing their bags and traveling thousands of miles to attend. This shows the importance that the nation places on sports. The fervor is no less than that of other countries. However, in this day and age, the imperialists' aggression towards us is like a fierce wind and torrential rain, and its momentum is increasing. The cry of national crisis has been around for years, but the noose is tightening and there is no sign of relief. Speaking of sports at this time, it should be different from times of peace. This must be noted. What is expected of athletes today is not the selection of a few outstanding heroes to be idols for the general public to admire, but the cultivation of strong bodies for the majority to shoulder the various hardships that lie ahead. Therefore, as athletes, one should not neglect the difference of an inch, a foot, a second, or a fraction of a second, but one should not only compete for the difference of an inch, a foot, a second, or a fraction of a second. As attendees, one should not ignore the competition techniques and athletic postures, but one should not only admire the competition techniques and athletic postures. The same goes for everything else. In itself, there is no such thing as advantages or disadvantages. Only when considering how it is used does it have beauty or ugliness. If those present at the National Games understand this, then even individual track and field competitions will not lose their significance in the present day. And the callisthenics performed by 3,000 primary school students is even more moving. For here one sees the signs of the popularization of physical education and the collectivization of sports. Conversely, if both athletes and spectators are ignorant of this, and only see the National Games as a great opportunity to show off their skills and have a rare good time, then during this time of hardship, spending a lot of money and mobilizing the masses is truly a pointless endeavor. We sincerely hope that it will never come to this.</p>
<p>Speaking of the popularization of physical education and the collectivization of sports, we have endless feelings. Last year, the Ministry of Education surveyed the physical condition of students in colleges and universities across the country. More than 20,000 students were examined, and more than one-third were found to have illnesses. At the same time, in order to improve school hygiene, the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau administered tuberculosis injections to a municipal primary school. More than 800 children were injected, and nearly two-thirds reacted. Regarding secondary school students, Ms. Chen Chuanzhe recently published an article in the Huogong Daily entitled "Save the Middle School Students," stating that secondary school students are burdened by heavy academic workloads and the examination system, and generally suffer from neurasthenia, headaches, and a tendency towards tuberculosis. As far as we can see, we share Ms. Chen's feelings. Young people under the age of twenty have underdeveloped muscles, dry complexions, and cannot sit or stand properly. They seem unable to cope with labor. Observing them at home and on the streets, this is a common sight, almost the rule. Therefore, speaking of the serious problems in the education sector today, the general poor health of students must be the first and foremost, and it cannot be ignored. If this problem is not effectively solved, then everything else is illusory, and there is no glimmer of hope. Today, callisthenics are a regular part of the curriculum in schools, and physiology and hygiene also occupy a considerable amount of lecture time. However, in reality, they are not only useless, but also have the opposite effect. This is because schools treat all training and teaching as routine matters. Callisthenics is not just about having students stretch their arms and legs. It is necessary to examine whether the movements are correct and whether they are persistent. Physiology and hygiene are not just about having students gain knowledge. It is necessary to examine whether their essence is integrated into their daily lives and whether they are practicing what they preach. But if everything is treated as a routine matter, merely ringing the bell to start the exercise and giving lectures on time, what can be achieved? Even worse, schools may ignore the fact that their students are becoming weaker, but they must have one or two athletes who can win at sports meetings to enhance the school's reputation. They may even urge one or two athletes to run and jump every morning and evening, and work hard to prepare for victory, but they are unwilling to pay attention to the daily lives, time allocation, and ability estimates of the general student body, so that they can all have strong bodies. If they go so far as to treat athletic competitions as meaningless, or even as something to be cursed. Now that the National Games are about to open, and we are making these almost disappointing remarks, it is because we fear that the nation will see the grand National Games and forget the general poor health of students. We especially hope that those involved in practical education will take this as the most urgent task at hand. Regarding the physical education of students, it must be as we said, with the aim of cultivating strong bodies for the majority. Under this premise, the popularization and collectivization of callisthenics must be more important than individual competitions, and hygiene facilities must also be related to all training and teaching. This is the right thing to do. All of this must be practiced, so it cannot stop at rules and announcements. It is necessary to measure its effectiveness at all times and in all matters. If this is done for three or five years, and then a survey is conducted, perhaps we can get a report that the physical condition of students is gradually improving. If we get this report, the intense sense of consolation it will evoke in the nation will be no less than witnessing the grand National Games.</p>

<h3>Solution to the Outer Pass Telecommunications Issue; Japanese Telegrams to and from Inside and Outside the Pass to be Officially Opened Next Month; Telegram Rates, Settlement Procedures, etc., All Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Outer Pass telecommunications issue was discussed on the 7th by Yin Tong and Wang Ruoxi with Takeshita, the chief of the Japanese Shanhaiguan Special Affairs Agency; Fujiwara Yasuaki, Director of Manchuria Postal Services; and Maeda Naotora, Business Manager of the Manchuria Telegraph Company, in Tianjin. It was decided to conclude an agreement on methods of settling Northeast telegram transmission fees, and regulations on Japanese telegram transmission, comprising 19 articles and 5 attachments. Starting on November 1st, the Tianjin and Beiping telegraph bureaus will implement the transmission of Japanese telegrams. Both sides publicly announced the main points of this agreement on the 8th. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Takeshita gave a speech in Tianjin on the 8th, saying that the Outer Pass telegram agreement and the acceptance of Japanese telegrams by the Beiping and Tianjin telegraph bureaus are a true expression of friendship between China and Japan, and that the satisfactory resolution of this issue will eliminate at least one obstacle between the peoples of the two countries. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Main Points of the Outer Pass Telecommunications Agreement: A. Both parties will settle telegram fees at the end of each month, paying the difference. B. 1. Japanese telegrams are limited to transmission between the South Manchurian Railway's attached territories, the Kwantung Leased Territory, and Harbin, Qiqihar, and Pingzhou. 2. Officially commences on October 1st. 3. Japanese telegrams are charged at five characters per word, with ordinary telegrams at 20 cents per word, code telegrams at 24 cents per word, and news telegrams at 3 cents per word. Urgent telegrams are charged double the ordinary telegram rate. 4. Place names and personal names in Japanese telegrams are calculated as two words. Other procedures follow telegraph regulations. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Regarding the restoration of Japanese telegram transmission between inside and outside the Pass, it has been agreed upon by the relevant parties that: A. It will be officially opened on November 1st. The procedures include: 1. Telegram rates are set at 12 cents per Japanese word for telegrams sent to outside the Pass, and 24 cents per code word. 2. Fee settlement will be handled by the Huitong Transfer Bureau in accordance with the established procedures. According to sources in the transportation industry, before the September 18th Incident, Shanghai, Yantai, Qingdao, and the Northeast already had Japanese telegram transmission. Although the Tianjin-Shenyang land line has been restored recently, Japanese has not been opened, and Japanese residents in Tianjin have been forwarding Japanese telegrams to Yuguan for transmission, which has significantly affected the revenue of the Tianjin telegraph bureau. It is necessary to restore transmission to promote business. (Central News Agency, 8th)</p>

He then went to the airport with Yan by car and flew west on the original plane at 1 p.m. The farewell from all circles was still extremely enthusiastic. According to Zhang's remarks to reporters before his departure, the situation with the bandits in Shaanxi is very serious. He has discussed concrete encirclement and suppression measures with Chiang and Yan, which will be implemented recently. Yan told reporters at the airport that Zhang's mission was due to the fact that the Sichuan bandits Zhu and Mao had already fled to the Guyuan area of Gansu Province. If they were to be thoroughly eliminated, it would not be possible with only a small number of troops. Therefore, it was proposed that troops from this province be sent to assist in the suppression. This province is certainly willing to do its best to suppress them, but the number of troops to be sent is still under consideration. Furthermore, the Shaanxi Bandit Suppression Headquarters is responsible for directing military affairs in the bandit suppression area in northern Shaanxi. After the establishment of the Northwest Headquarters, it will be reorganized. (Eighth Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Reactions to the League of Nations Resolution: Different Responses from Italy and Abyssinia; Abyssinia Continues to Trust that Italy Will Withdraw from the League</h3>
<p>(Rome) Italian public opinion, which had believed in the past few days that the League of Nations would certainly agree with Italy's views, feels quite unhappy and shocked to hear that the Executive Council has resolved that Italy has violated the League of Nations Covenant. Many feel that Italy would not withdraw from the League unless expelled, which Mussolini has repeatedly announced. However, there are fears that events will change rapidly, forcing Italy to withdraw from the League. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(Rome) A foreign ministry spokesman stated today that Italy will soon decide whether to remain a member of the League of Nations, but the future development cannot be predicted until the resolution passed in Geneva is officially announced. General De Bono has not yet reported the number of casualties in the attack on the two cities of Adigrat and Adowa in northern Abyssinia. While the League of Nations is discussing sanctions against Italy, a large-scale demonstration was held by the people of Rome in the Palazzo Venezia. Thousands of people sang patriotic songs to Mussolini and paraded through the streets carrying satirical paintings of the Abyssinian Emperor, shouting slogans such as "Mussolini" and "Adowa." (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: Although the Executive Council of the League of Nations has voted to impose sanctions on Italy, the Abyssinian Emperor is still speeding up preparations for war, ready to fight the Italian army to the end. The Emperor has little hope for the League of Nations' power to stop Mussolini. His advisors say that now that Adowa has fallen, French diplomacy can stop the Italian army from advancing, but the Emperor does not believe this. The Emperor stated today, "Abyssinia has not yet begun to fight, but it is imperative to defend all the mountain lines. Abyssinia will meet the enemy with a million soldiers." According to unofficial estimates here, 6,000 Abyssinian civilians have died in the northern route, while the Italian side has lost about 800. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: The Abyssinian Emperor recently issued a declaration to the press, saying that Abyssinia should continue to trust in the wisdom and integrity of the League of Nations. Abyssinia has applied to the League of Nations since December of last year, but the League has delayed processing it, yet Abyssinia still trusts it. Only the Executive Council of the League of Nations can punish unjust acts of aggression. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: When the Abyssinian Emperor telegraphed the League of Nations requesting it to invoke Article 16 of the Covenant, he strongly stated that the Abyssinian army had obeyed orders and did not resist the Italian army. The claim that the Abyssinian army abandoned Adowa without a fight, in order to prove that Italy was the aggressor in this war before the formal resistance, is emphasized. Officials insist that the reports of Italian planes bombing Abyssinian areas and causing many casualties are greatly exaggerated. For example, in the Balahay area, Italian forces dropped as many as 300 bombs, but only five people were killed and fifteen injured. The Italian war reports and the press claims that many people were killed and injured are not accurate. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<h3>Italian Embassy in Tianjin Purchases Large Quantities of Coal; Sino-Italian War Affects Tianjin Market</h3>

<h3>Roosevelt's Actions Support League of Nations Sanctions; US Customs Implements Arms Embargo</h3>

Observers, after studying the President's order, have stated that member states of the League of Nations can order American ships to stop sailing without angering the United States government.

<h3>Britain and America Deny Tacit Agreement on Far East Navy; British Fleet Not Entirely Deployed to Singapore; US Fleet Not Concentrated in Hong Kong</h3>

It is not believed here that there is a tacit agreement between Britain and the United States on naval affairs in the Far East. Navy officials said that the fleet will continue to operate as scheduled, and some warships will arrive in French Indochina's territorial waters on October 13. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>

<h3>Italian Strategy Towards Britain: Willing to Participate in Naval Negotiations</h3>

It has recently been learned that the Italian government has decided to accept the British proposal and participate in the London naval talks. This decision by Italy is generally seen here as an action to ease relations between Britain and Italy. In addition, it is also reported that France has accepted sending naval experts to London to participate in the talks. However, the Japanese government still maintains its original position, that is, Japan's participation in the London Naval Conference should be conditional on all countries first recognizing the principle of naval parity. It is also reported that the Japanese government has proposed that the naval conference should be postponed until next year due to the current tense situation of the Italian-Abyssinian conflict.

<h3>US Silver Faction Splits; United Front No Longer Exists</h3>
<p>(New York) Judging from recent developments, the Congressional silver faction seems to have split into three, each with different interests. According to observers, the united front of the silver faction, which had strong influence, no longer exists. However, there is no organization that openly opposes the silver bill. The first group to go its own way is the faction led by Senator Thomas, whose main goal is to raise the price of silver to $1.29, regardless of other considerations. However, Thomas has now publicly announced that he is abandoning his silver struggle. The second faction consists of congressmen associated with the tobacco industry. This faction previously strongly supported the passage of legislation on silver, but now it acknowledges that the silver policy has severely affected tobacco sales to China and that this policy is not only harmful to the tobacco industry, but also whether it is beneficial to silver producers is questionable. The third faction is led by Senator Pittman. Pittman has managed to use his own special committee to investigate the Treasury Department's silver purchases and has scheduled the first meeting in Salt Lake City on October 12. Although this committee also opposes the Treasury Department, it is more moderate than others. It is expected that the Treasury Department's policies will not change much. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>Telegram from the Huaihai Salt Affairs Inspection Sub-Bureau</h3>
<p>Having read the article from Xuzhou dated October 2 in your esteemed newspaper, which states that the Chai Mi North Dyke in the Lihengzhuang area of Donghai County was breached at night by tax police from Guanyun County, causing a flood of water to rush toward the Donghai and Shuyu counties, expanding the disaster area. Upon investigation, a portion of the tax police unit under our jurisdiction was working in Geji and Tangzhuang and other places on the east bank of the Liutang River between September 21 and 29. The unit was withdrawn because the Chai Mi riverbank burst and water poured into the Hai and Guan counties, resulting in futile efforts. Another portion of the unit has been working on the frozen banks of the Yanhai River from September 22 to the present, and there has been no tax police activity in Lihengzhuang, Donghai, breaching the Chai Mi River's north levee to allow water to flow. We request that this information be corrected to protect the reputation of the police. We respectfully submit this telegram for your kind consideration. Huaihai Salt Affairs Inspection Sub-Bureau respectfully.</p>
<h3>Public Telegram: Tongshan Suffers from Both Flood and Drought, Awaiting Relief</h3>
<p>To Chairman Xu of the Nanjing Relief Committee, Chairman Chen of the Zhenjiang Provincial Government, and Director Zhao, and copied to the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Society, Chinese Jisheng Society, Red Swastika Society, Shen Bao Newspaper, Xinwen Bao Newspaper, and all charitable organizations: Tongshan is located in the northern border of Jiangsu Province, with barren land and poor people. Every time there is a bad year, the young and strong take risks, and the old and weak are left in ditches. Since the flood of the 20th year of the Republic, the rural economy has collapsed, its vitality has been greatly damaged, all industries have declined, and livelihoods are difficult. The Yellow River suddenly changed its course this morning, flooding Tongshan's territory, and the Weishan Lake continued to overflow, causing flooding. Passing through the Jinghe and Bulao Rivers, the flood flowed into the sea. People in the northeast and north villages of Tongshan were displaced, their family properties were destroyed, and the number of livestock swept away was countless. The cries of the old and young are unbearable to hear. Fortunately, our worthy magistrates Commissioner Shao and County Magistrate Wang personally led the local elders, patrolling and blocking the floods day and night, through wind and rain, for two months. Only then was the urban area spared from being submerged. Unexpectedly, since autumn, rainfall has been scarce, and the fields and crops have withered. The southwest villages, which were not affected by the Yellow River flood, have also had no harvest. Some areas are flooded, while others are barren. Both flood and drought have occurred, and the people's lives are unbearable. Now, winter is approaching in an instant. There is no clothing to keep warm, no food to satisfy hunger, and no shelter to protect from wind and rain. We hope that your newspaper will forward this message to all charitable organizations, that they will show great compassion and find ways to provide relief so that we, the survivors, can survive. This association respectfully represents the disaster victims of the entire county in appealing and awaits your orders urgently. The Jiangsu Tongshan Association in Beijing respectfully, with seal.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Pirates Burn Ships, Leading to Tragic Robbery</h3>
<p>The Sheng Sheng Steamer Encounters Pirates and is Burned Near Shilong, Sinking the Entire Ship and Drowning Over a Hundred Passengers</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondent: Transportation between Guangzhou and Shilong Town in Dongguan County has always been convenient. In addition to the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, there is also waterway access, so no fewer than ten civilian and cargo ships travel between Guangzhou and Shilong every day. Civilian ship tickets are cheaper than train tickets, so many passengers choose the waterway. On the evening of the 1st of this month, the Sheng Sheng electric boat, which runs between Guangzhou and Shilong, was fully loaded with passengers and cargo. It departed from the Wuxianmen Pier on Changdi, Guangzhou, and the journey was calm and peaceful. After midnight, the passengers were asleep. Around 12 o'clock, as the ship was sailing on the Dushu River about twenty miles from Shilong, it was suddenly attacked by more than ten bandits on the shore, who opened fire on the electric boat in an attempt to intercept it. At the same time, undercover bandits on the ship also secretly attacked. Three bandits disguised as passengers fired guns from the cabin to threaten the passengers and set fire to the electric boat. Chaos erupted instantly. The ship's manager, Luo Bao, rushed down from the ship's deck to stop the bandits, but he was outnumbered and was shot in the foot. As the chaos unfolded, bandits on the shore boarded the boat in small boats and began looting. Before long, there were three fires on the ship, with flames reaching the sky. All the passengers on board either died in the fire or drowned in the water. The cries were deafening and unbearable. Only those who were good swimmers were able to escape. Most of the women and children were burned to death or drowned in the water. It is estimated that there were over a hundred passengers and twenty or thirty crew members. Only forty or so people were able to swim ashore or were rescued. The remaining one hundred and twenty or so passengers were buried in the river. After being injured, the ship's manager Luo Bao was rescued by his companions back to Shilong. He immediately reported the incident to the Third Regiment of the Training Division stationed in Shilong. Regiment Commander Chen Ji immediately dispatched a company of soldiers to the scene. By then, the Sheng Sheng had been completely burned and sunk on the beach. The bandits had also fled without a trace. Only floating corpses were seen along the waterway. After this news spread, the Shilong Fushantang Mingshantang and the Guangzhou Convenience Hospital immediately sent specialists to purchase wooden coffins and go to the scene of the incident to retrieve the bodies. On the second day, they retrieved 48 male and female corpses, photographed each one and numbered them, and temporarily placed them in coffins for relatives to claim. Among them were eleven members of the Hongmian Women's Troupe, with only one survivor. On the same day, more than ten floating corpses were recovered from the Huangpu River nearby. Further discoveries were made on the third and fourth days, truly a major tragedy on the river in recent days. The Sheng Sheng is owned by the Yong Tong Yuan Company. In May of this year, it was leased by the Ping An Shipping Company to operate the Guangzhou-Shilong line. The ship is over eighty feet long and can carry two hundred passengers. The engine runs on electric oil to generate power, hence the name "electric boat." Due to the burning, the shipowner suffered losses of forty to fifty thousand yuan, and cargo owners also lost over ten thousand yuan in goods. (October 4)</p>

<p>Suzhou Woman Rescued After Attempting Suicide by Drowning</p>
<p>Yuan Yingmei, a woman from Suzhou, is in the prime of her life, with beautiful looks. She graduated from Shanghai Jingcheng Middle School. In February of last year, she met a young man in a Western suit in Shanghai, named Qin Zhi, from Jiangdu. He rented a house in Xihu Fang, Ximen Road. In June of this year, Qin came to Zhenjiang to seek employment in the provincial government because he had been living idly for a long time. However, he disappeared for months without a trace. Yingmei became worried about her livelihood. A few days ago, she came to Zhenjiang from Shanghai and stayed with a relative outside the South Gate. She visited various places for several days, but found no news. She realized that she had been deceived and, in her grief and indignation, she had suicidal thoughts. On the morning of the 8th, she attempted suicide by drowning herself in the Ganlu Harbor East Head. A farmer named Liu Dafu happened to see her and rescued her ashore in time, saving her life. Liu saw that the woman was not ordinary and took her home to get her clothes, so she changed her clothes. After questioning her repeatedly, she told him about the situation. He immediately informed the woman's relatives, who sent her back to her hometown in Suzhou.</p>

<h3>Business Operations Loaning: Changed to Acceptance Bill Fund; Loan Committee Has Approved in Principle; Loan Applications Continue to Be Discussed and Resolved</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Industry and Commerce Loan Review Committee convened a meeting the day before yesterday to review more than 40 loan applications, approving loans exceeding 20,000 yuan. Regarding the 3 million yuan factory operation loan, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce suggested changing it to a fund for promoting acceptance bills. It is heard that the principle has been approved and a meeting will be held soon to discuss implementation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Loan Applications Continue to Be Discussed and Resolved</p>
<p>The 14th review meeting of the Loan Committee was held at 4 p.m. on the 7th at the Bank of China. Committee members Cai Zengji, Wang Yansong, Qin Runqing, Bei Songsun (representing Wang), Xi Deluan, Song Ziliang, Zhang Peishen, and others were present. Forty-one applications for small industrial and commercial credit loans were submitted. After reviewing each case, it was decided to approve loans for nine companies, approve half the loan amount for ten companies, approve a reduced portion of the originally requested loan amount for nineteen companies, and reject loan applications from three companies. A total of 25,700 yuan in loans were approved. It is reported that the committee will soon issue notices based on the decisions. Those approved for loans can proceed to sign agreements and collect the funds upon receiving the notice. Those rejected can reclaim the investigation fee of two yuan by presenting their previous receipts. The reasons for the rejections were that one company's business involved manufacturing and selling recreational and entertainment items, which was inconsistent with the purpose of the relief efforts. The other two companies were selling goods that were not domestic products, which was inconsistent with the loan principles. The committee is still accepting applications for small credit loans. Recently, many people have been visiting the committee's office inside the Bank of China on Tianjin Road to obtain articles of association and application forms for loans. However, in accordance with the loan principles, the committee always asks whether they are engaged in domestic goods businesses before issuing the forms. This loan is limited to domestic goods factories and businesses.</p>
<p>Acceptance Bills Approved in Principle</p>
<p>The committee previously planned to allocate 3 million yuan for factory operation loans. It has now been learned that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce suggested changing the previous plan and allocating this fund to promote acceptance bills, in order to promote this innovative financial initiative for universal circulation. It is heard that the principle has been approved. The detailed measures will be discussed at the next meeting. Furthermore, after this proposal is approved, it must be approved by the credit loan banks and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval before it can be implemented.</p>
<h3>Sharp Increase in Shanghai Goods Exported to the U.S. in the First Nine Months of This Year</h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" reported that the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai announced statistics today, stating that Shanghai's exports to the United States in the first nine months of this year totaled US$12,274,757. The figure for the same period last year was US$8,578,296, and for the same period in 1933, it was US$7,327,341. However, Shanghai's exports to the Philippines and Hawaii in the first nine months of this year decreased, totaling US$752,414, compared to US$965,104 for the same period last year and US$873,852 for the same period in 1933. The largest increases in Shanghai's exports to the United States in the first nine months of this year were in inedible vegetable products and textiles, which increased sharply from US$383,258 last year to US$2,822,886.</p>
<h3>Financial Public Bonds Allocated by the Ministry of Finance: Qian Industry Continues to Repay; Hopes to Safely Navigate the End of the Year</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance previously allocated 25 million yuan in financial public bonds of the Republic of China in 1935 to rescue the qian industry, establishing the Qian Industry Supervision Committee to oversee everything. It is reported that the Qian Industry Supervision Committee sent a letter to the Qian Industry Association in August, instructing all businesses to repay as much as possible. Up to the second month, the number of repayments from businesses accounts for one-fifth of the total, about 5 million yuan. With the end of the year rapidly approaching, the Ministry of Finance has instructed the Qian Industry Association to continue to accommodate the extension of long-term loans, to rescue industry and commerce and stabilize the market. Therefore, both industry and commerce and the qian industry can safely navigate this month. Regarding the financial public bonds, it has been decided to continue repayment. It is estimated that half can be repaid by the end of this year, i.e., over 12 million yuan. The remaining half will have to be repaid next year.</p>

<h3>City Federation Petitions the Municipal Government This Morning: Officially Order Rent Reduction to Aid Relief; Holds a Representative Assembly This Afternoon to Report</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation believes that the Shanghai market is declining daily, and that disaster victims are eagerly awaiting relief. It has specifically scheduled a representative assembly of district branch representatives at 3 p.m. today to discuss the issue of reducing rents and relieving the market, and at 10 a.m. today, it has sent representatives Chen Jiufeng, Cao Zhigong, Wang Jingdong, Zou Ao Kui, Zhang Xianfang, and others to petition the Shanghai Municipal Government to reduce rents and aid relief to save disaster victims. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Petition</p>
<p>The federation representatives, Chen Jiufeng, and others, will present the petition to the municipal government this morning. The petition states, "We are submitting this petition to request an official order for the implementation of rent reduction and relief to promote rural relief and revive the city market. The industry and commerce of this city is declining to the extreme. Various industries are struggling to survive, and those declaring bankruptcy and liquidation are coming one after another. Unemployment is constantly expanding, and the lives of ordinary citizens are becoming increasingly impoverished. The reasons for this are: firstly, the bankruptcy of the countryside and the decline in the purchasing power of the vast masses, which has led to the current state of sluggish sales; and secondly, the high cost of rent, which is unbearable and is a source of concern for all citizens and the industrial and commercial sectors. Therefore, to save the situation, it is necessary to make every effort to relieve the countryside, and there is no other way to eliminate the root causes of the disease. Unless rent reduction is implemented swiftly, the current crisis cannot be averted. The association has identified the cause of the problem and is considering remedies. Therefore, there is a suggestion to reduce rents and aid relief, and the fourth executive committee meeting has resolved the following measures: (1) The municipal authorities should be requested to officially order the implementation of a 60% rent reduction; (2) All of the 40% reduction should be used for relief to save disaster areas; (3) The 40% aid relief should be for a period of three months, after which the tenants will enjoy the full benefit of the reduction to ease their burden; (4) The above rent reduction regulations may be revoked by the municipal authorities when the market has reached a considerable level of prosperity. This matter concerns the relief of the countryside, the revival of the city market, and the safety of society. We dare to present the reasons for rent reduction and relief, and have sent representatives Chen Jiufeng, Cao Zhigong, Wang Jingdong, Zou Ao Kui, Zhang Xianfang, and others to petition. We respectfully implore you to consider the difficulties of the times and approve the official implementation. This would be a great blessing. Sincerely presented to Mayor Wu of the Shanghai Municipal Government, Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation."</p>

<h3>Voluntary Registration of Smokers Will End Soon; Police Actively Encourage</h3>
<p>The voluntary registration period for smokers organized by the Municipal Public Security Bureau will end in just three weeks. Compulsory registration will be implemented on the first of next month. During this compulsory registration period, self-reporting by smoking civilians will be stopped. Once a civilian is found to be secretly smoking, they will be fined and forced to register. Therefore, the bureau has compiled answers to questions about smoker registration, detailing the significance and implementation of smoker registration. These have been distributed to the public by various branches, so that those who do not fully understand the significance and methods of smoker registration can understand them fully and come forward to register voluntarily as soon as possible. In order to further enhance the effectiveness of the encouragement, the bureau has added investigators to assist the police of various branches in re-investigating smokers and urging them to register since the 5th of this month. This work has been actively implemented and has achieved considerable success. The 15th of this month is the deadline. The number of smokers registered by the bureau has been several hundred per day in recent days.</p>

<p>The engine of the 522nd freight train from Maigen Road to Nanjing on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway was suddenly damaged at the 55-kilometer mark between Kunshan Zhengyi stations at about 5 a.m. yesterday, causing the 5th night express train from Beijing to Shanghai the night before to be unable to move forward after arriving at Zhengyi Station.

Therefore, it was delayed by two hours and twenty minutes when it arrived in Shanghai. The 301st regular Shanghai-Shanghai train was also delayed by one hour.

<h3>Young Aviator Sun Tonggang is Safe in Italy: Some Party Received a Letter from Sun Within a Week</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Sun Tonggang, a well-known young aviator in China, studied at the German National Traffic Aviation School in 1933 and made a 20,000-mile long-distance flight, returning to China from Germany in a self-made aircraft, and then made a national flight, showing a unique color in China's aviation industry. Last year, he went to Italy for further study. However, recently there have been rumors that Sun was practicing aircraft in Italy and fell from a height due to mechanical failure, destroying both the person and the aircraft. This materialization of China's aviation talent was quite shocking for a time. However, yesterday, according to inquiries from a reporter of the Central News Agency to a party closely related to Sun, it was firmly stated that the news was a rumor, because after Sun left the country, they have always been in correspondence. The party told the reporter of the Central News Agency that they had received a letter from Sun within a week, reporting that he was safe on his journey. According to reports, Sun is a famous figure in China's aviation industry. If he had an accident in Italy, foreign telegraph agencies would not have been unaware.</p>

<h3>National Government Advisor Millard Resigns: Continues to Manage News Business</h3>
<p>According to the "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury", Dr. Thomas Millard, who has served as an advisor to the National Government since 1930, has now resigned and plans to return to his news business. The doctor was previously a well-known publisher in this city and a correspondent for various American newspapers. He devoted considerable effort to the abolition of consular jurisdiction. In 1931, he published a book entitled "The End of Consular Jurisdiction in China". After the September 18th Incident, he went to Manchuria to investigate. Later, he often traveled to Washington, London, Geneva, and other places. He only returned to China a few weeks ago. Several years before the European War, the doctor founded the English-language "China Press" in Shanghai. During the European War, he was dissatisfied with the British due to his neutral policy, so he lost the management of the newspaper before the United States entered the war. The doctor also founded "Millard's Review" in 1927, which was later sold to Powell and renamed "China Weekly Review". The doctor has served as a correspondent in China for several major American newspapers and has written many books on Chinese issues.</p>

<h3>National Federation of Commerce Appeals for Tax Reduction on Hunan Province Brokerage Fees</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Finance stating, "The Hunan brokerage tax is levied at 3% of the commission. Member associations previously received a request from all brokers in Yiyang to forward a petition, pleading for a reduction, otherwise they would cease operations. This matter was forwarded to your ministry last month. Recently, we also received a joint letter from 19 petitioners representing brokers from Xiangtan, including Luo Botao, Liu Songhe representing brokers from Jinshi, He Ru representing brokers from Yueyang, He Zhongjie representing brokers from Yiyang, Liu Zhiqing representing brokers from Changde, Yang Gongxuan representing brokers from Hengyang, etc., stating that since Hunan province changed its taxation method to levy taxes based on commission amount, brokers in various counties deeply feel that the new regulations are cumbersome and difficult to implement, causing widespread discontent. They have petitioned the Hunan Finance Department to revoke the order. Their reasoning is that under the old system of brokerage licenses, the tax levied was relatively light and affordable, with Class A paying 50 yuan annually, Class B 40 yuan, Class C 30 yuan, Class D 20 yuan, and Class E 10 yuan. The new regulations abolish the old tax and completely base it on the commission amount, requiring verification of accounting books to determine the tax base, making the process extremely troublesome. Under this method, commissions, if large, can be taxed hundreds of yuan, and even small commissions will be taxed over one hundred yuan. Compared to the old system, this is an increase of several to over ten or dozens of times. At a time when floods and droughts are frequent, famine is imminent, the rural economy is bankrupt, and the purchasing power of the people is weak, causing commerce to plummet, it is unreasonable to further increase the tax burden on already struggling brokers. Moreover, taxing commissions includes the brokerage firm's employee salaries, rent, and all operating expenses without deduction, making it even more difficult to bear. This tax law is extremely unfair. The Hunan provincial financial authorities disregard the interests of the people, only focusing on increasing tax revenue, thus inciting opposition from brokers in various counties. Although Director Zhang of the Finance Department previously reduced it to 3%, it is still deemed inconvenient. Later, representatives from various county brokers gathered at the Finance Department to petition, and Director Zhang initially agreed to change it, but only reduced the spring and summer taxes by 30%, a ludicrous response. In short, the brokers in various counties, concerned with their own hardships, believe that only reverting to the old taxation method can alleviate their difficulties. Therefore, this petition is not a mere complaint. If the new regulations are implemented, both officials and merchants will suffer. The representatives have always been public-spirited and obedient to orders, but their repeated requests are due to careful consideration of the gains, losses, benefits, and harms, concluding that it severely impacts commerce and the people's livelihood, necessitating relief to maintain the status quo and save what remains. Fearing that the lower sentiments may not reach higher authorities, in addition to dispatching Li Jinfan, a standing committee member of the Xiangtan County Chamber of Commerce, to present the case in person, we have prepared this document to earnestly request your esteemed association to investigate and approve, and promptly forward it to the Ministry of Finance, instructing the Hunan Provincial Government Finance Department to immediately revoke the new taxation method based on commission amount, and revert to the old taxation method based on brokerage licenses to alleviate commercial difficulties and promote prosperity. We also recommend Li Jinfan, a standing committee member of the Xiangtan County Chamber of Commerce, as a representative to petition the association. Therefore, we respectfully telegraph your esteemed ministry to investigate and approve, and promptly instruct the Hunan Provincial Government to revoke the order and revert to the old tax collection method, or reduce the tax rate to alleviate commercial hardships and revive the people's livelihood. This is our earnest plea. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce of the Republic of China, respectfully. Geng Yin."</p>
<p>Furthermore, the association simultaneously telegraphed He Yunqiao (Jian), Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, requesting the revocation of the order to levy taxes based on commission amount to alleviate commercial hardships and revive the people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Answers Inquiries Regarding Stamp Tax on Receipts, etc.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce yesterday replied to the Ping Sheng Dun Company, answering inquiries regarding the stamp tax amounts for receipts, delivery orders, invoices, etc. The original letter stated, "We have received your inquiry regarding the stamp duty required for invoices, receipts, etc., and request instructions." The reply is as follows: "(1) Receipts: According to item 2 of the Stamp Tax Rate Table, for receipts of money or goods, each item with an amount or price of three yuan or more requires a stamp of 1 fen, ten yuan or more requires a stamp of 1 fen, ten yuan or more requires a stamp of 2 fen, up to a maximum of 3 fen for amounts over one hundred yuan. (2) Delivery orders: According to the provisions of item 1 of the same table, the stamp tax amount is the same as item 2 for receipts of money or goods. (3) Invoices: According to the provisions of item 2 of the same table, the stamp tax amount is the same as items 1 and 2 for delivery orders and receipts. However, for overdue debt invoices issued during the New Year's holidays, which only list the previous balance for reconciliation purposes, according to Article 3, Section 9 of the Stamp Tax Law, they are exempt from stamp tax. We are replying accordingly, hoping you will take note. Regarding the Stamp Tax Law and its interpretations, our Monthly Bulletin has published a special edition of the New Stamp Tax Law, priced at 1 jiao and 5 fen per copy, available for purchase at our association for your reference."</p>
<h3>Aviation Association Headquarters Set to Hold Groundbreaking Ceremony; Entire Project Scheduled for Completion by Year-End</h3>

The details of the donations received have been reported previously. The brick and tile transportation industry, since its commencement on June 15th, has been diligently working, with enthusiastic support from all sectors, progressing very smoothly. It has already submitted the proceeds of each period to the office. Yesterday, it submitted the ninth installment of donations totaling 650 yuan, 0 jiao, and 3 fen. The office also received continued membership fees of 50 yuan from Shen Jiran, captain of Team 221, membership fees and donations of 288 yuan, 4 jiao, and 1 fen, and 472 jiao in small silver coins from Li Gongpu, captain of Team 346, membership fees of 468 yuan from Wu Qiding, manager of Team 161, membership fees of 86 yuan from Wang Xueqi, captain of Team 321, membership fees of 12 yuan and donations of 22 yuan, 7 jiao, and 3 fen from Pan Gongzhan, captain of Team 149, and membership fees of 69 yuan and 5 jiao from Feng Yixian, captain of Team 383, and continued membership fees of 30 yuan from Shi Chun, vice-captain of Team 67.

The headquarters is divided into three parts, structurally resembling an airplane model. The two wings will be the exhibition halls, the fuselage will be the office and auditorium, and the tail will also be offices. Since construction began in June of this year, the project has progressed rapidly. By the end of this year, the entire project of the headquarters and exhibition hall will be completed, and formal office work can begin by New Year's Day next year. It is reported that the groundbreaking ceremony is scheduled for the 12th of this month.</p>
<h3>Chairman of the Chinese Cigarette Factory Association, Shen Weiting, Sends Letter to the City Chamber of Commerce Regarding Thorough Investigation of Xuchang Tobacco Company</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce's request to the Ministry of Industry for a thorough investigation of the Xuchang Tobacco Company was reported yesterday. It is now learned that Mr. Shen Weiting, Chairman of the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Association, believes that many of the statements made in the association's petition are inconsistent with the facts. Yesterday, he sent a letter to the City Chamber of Commerce in his personal capacity, stating, "To Whom It May Concern, I have read the news in the Shen Bao, Shi Shi Xin Bao, and Shang Bao newspapers on the 8th of this month regarding your association's petition to the Ministry of Industry, which states that according to Shen Weiting, Chairman of the Chinese Cigarette Factory Association, the Xuchang Company was organized by Wu Tingsheng with a capital of 100,000 yuan, and the tobacco leaves from the British American Tobacco Company are collected by the company on their behalf. As the crux of the matter lies in whether it is foreign capital, if it is not foreign capital, a written certification should be provided. Shen Weiting believed it was inappropriate and refused to comply. Later, a note was provided stating that the company declares itself to be Chinese capital, but since it was not signed or stamped with the association's seal, it is not an official responsible document, etc. I have found that many of the statements made are inconsistent with the facts. I am now writing to clarify the circumstances to reveal the truth. On the afternoon of the 3rd of this month, Mr. Xue Jianxin visited the association, claiming to have been sent by the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce to investigate the organizational structure and contents of the Xuchang Company. Because Mr. Xue did not present a formal letter of inquiry from the City Chamber of Commerce and did not provide a copy of the original letter from the Shanghai Tobacco Leaf Association, which is different from formal correspondence between legal entities, I immediately stated that I was willing to speak to Mr. Xue in my personal capacity. Subsequently, Mr. Xue, fearing that it would be difficult to remember, specifically requested Mr. Chen Shaohong, the secretary of our association, to record what I said in a written report and then left. The next day, Secretary Chen sealed the report and sent it to Mr. Xue. The report stated that the Xuchang Tobacco Company was established with Chinese capital and registered with the Ministry of Industry. Mr. Wu Tingsheng had indicated to various member cigarette factories that the Xuchang Company's business is to buy and sell tobacco to Chinese and foreign cigarette factories. Any Chinese or foreign cigarette factory can entrust the company to collect tobacco leaves, and the company will be responsible for handling it, charging a commission of 1 to 1.5 fen per yuan.' These were the only remarks I made that day. As the report was recorded by Mr. Chen at Mr. Xue's request, and the conversation was entirely based on personal relations, it was not appropriate to affix the association's seal. Considering the procedure, there should be no impropriety. Fearing that the outside world would misunderstand the truth and cause confusion, I am writing to clarify the situation. I hope you will take note. Yours sincerely, Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce."</p>

<h3>China Pencil Factory Begins Operations</h3>
<p>China imports millions of dollars worth of pencils every year, but there are few domestic pencil manufacturers. Wu Gengfu, a pencil expert who studied in Japan, recognizing this, returned to China and, with the support of political and business figures such as Yu Qiaqing, Zhang Yongni, Cui Weiwu, Pan Gongzhan, and Ma Yinliang, established the China Pencil Factory, with Zhang Weishi and Wu Gengmei responsible for preparations. This spring, they began installing machinery and building furnaces at 1176 Xiexu Road, Shanghai, using various domestically produced raw materials such as pencil lead, clay, and wood, and employing workers to manufacture pencils. After painstaking research lasting half a year, they successfully produced various brands of black lead pencils, red and blue pencils, and copying pencils, including the "Airplane" and "Ding" brands. The quality of the products is excellent, surpassing that of imported goods. Therefore, the Shanghai Education Bureau, the Literacy Education Committee, various primary and secondary schools, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Sanbei Shipping Company, the International Telegraph Administration, the Shen Bao newspaper, the Chen Bao newspaper, and the Sixth National Games have all placed orders with the factory. It is reported that in recent months, the factory has been successively inviting people from the local press, financial circles, educational circles, bookstores, and stationery industries to visit, all of whom have praised the factory's perfect equipment, dedicated workforce, orderly layout, and excellent products.

It was stated that initially, the defendants Ji Rentang, Qiu Guobin, Wang Chenshi, Ji Chenshi, and others jointly discussed robbing a certain money shop, but were unable to obtain firearms and abandoned the plan. In August, they again discussed</p>
<p>Robbing the Post Office.</p>
<p>Ji Rentang was responsible for borrowing firearms and accomplices from Funing. Subsequently, several criminals came to Shanghai, bringing four pistols. In total, including Ji Rentang, there were ten people. They learned that the post office would transfer a large sum of money to the savings bureau every Monday morning. At 8:00 AM, they hired a car, number 17671, from the Dalai Motor Company, drove to Qimei Road in Zhabei, forced the driver out of the car, and tied him up. After the robbery, Ji Rentang received 3,500 yuan in silver. Qiu Guobin and Ji Chenshi,</p>
<p>Because They Did Not Go,</p>
<p>Each received only 200 yuan in silver. Because Qiu and others were dissatisfied, Ji Rentang gave Qiu another 25 yuan and Shi 50 yuan. He deposited 1,000 yuan in the Jin Cheng Bank, took 1,000 yuan to Funing, and gave 1,000 yuan to his mistress Wang Chenshi and others to sew into a quilt. On the 21st, they planned to take the Dehe wheel to escape elsewhere. Detectives learned of this and, together with the Public Security Bureau, went to the Dehe wheel and arrested Qiu Guobin and Wang Chenshi. 14 yuan in silver notes were found on Qiu and 317 yuan in silver notes, two silver bracelets, and a gold ring with the name "Little Brother" and a key were found on Wang Chenshi. Then, at 327 Siwen Lane, Xin Zha Road,</p>
<p>Jin Cheng Bank</p>
<p>A certificate of deposit for 1,000 yuan was seized. The money was withdrawn with the gold ring with the name "Little Brother." Later, Ji Chenshi was arrested at No. 2 Pingliang Road and 157 yuan in silver notes were found in her menstrual belt. Chen Qiushi was arrested on Yuezhou Road and 223 yuan in silver notes were seized. Later, together with the Funing Tax Police Corps, Ji Rentang was arrested at the Guanyin Pavilion Temple in the Tianxi Factory in Funing. 15 yuan in silver notes and double-horned notes were seized. After interrogation by the Funing County Government, he fully confessed. The whereabouts of the 1,000 yuan in silver notes sewn into the quilt are unknown and are under investigation. Each defendant had previously confessed in detail to the police station, and the existing confession was presented to the court for review. It was argued that the</p>
<p>Case is Complex</p>
<p>And it is difficult to understand without extensive research. Therefore, it was requested that a special hearing be scheduled. Judge Jiang then interrogated the defendants separately. All the defendants confessed. The interrogation lasted until after 1:00 PM and was not yet completed. It was then announced that the hearing would be adjourned. Chen Xiaohongzi, Zhu Xiaomao, Qiu Yushi, and Wang Fanshi were released. Wang Fanshi was sent by the Shanghai Local Court and should be returned immediately.</p>

<h3>Old North Gate Police Chief Shen Zhenhua Urges Opium Addicts to Register</h3>
<p>Shen Zhenhua, chief of the Old North Gate Police Station, recently found that opium addicts in the area who had been surveyed and repeatedly advised were mostly observing and avoiding registering with the station, which is extremely disrespectful to the law. With the deadline for mandatory registration approaching, he recently</p>
<p>Ordered Police Chief Gao Kui</p>
<p>To lead police officers to Dagjing Road, Luxiangyuan Road, Old Warehouse Street, and other places to arrest over forty opium addicts who refused to register, and bring them to the station and order them to register. However, the opium addicts claimed they were too poor to register. Chief Shen asked them how they had money to smoke opium but no money to register, calling them cunning officials. After persuasion, the opium addicts all claimed that they could only register as poor people, paying 6 jiao per person per period. However, poor people registration requires a guarantor, and there were concerns about fraud, and a detailed investigation would be needed to confirm if they were truly poor, otherwise the registration would be invalid. They were still ordered to register, paying 5 yuan per person per period. Therefore, the station is extremely busy processing these procedures.</p>
<h3>Nanshi Detects Theft Case and Detains Xu Monk and Others</h3>
<p>The Ximen Municipal Public Security Bureau received reports of theft from the Lujiabang Lixing Electrical Machinery Factory, Jumen Road, Xieshi Road, Jifeng Dyeing Factory, and the Great Shanghai Industrial Company, of camel hair, rayon, motor machinery, and other items. Yao, the Branch Chief, instructed Deputy Detectives Shen Wenda and Luo Weixin to lead detectives Bian Wenguang, Jiao Baojun, and Chen Mingsheng to conduct a rigorous investigation. At the intersection of Deyun Lane, Xiesu Road, a suspect named Li Agen, a native of Shaoxing, was arrested. He stated that he worked in the northern city and when he returned home, his wife told him that Xie Jifa, Xu Heshang, and Ding Arong had carried a motor and left it at the back door, asking her to watch it. After a short time, they came and carried it away. The next morning, they brought two coins totaling something extra, but he didn't know anything else. Then, Detective Shen led the original officers to arrest Xu Heshang, a 54-year-old native of Shaoxing, at No. 13 Deyun Lane, Xieshi Road. Xu Heshang confessed that he and Ding Arong, Xie Jifa, and Shan Ajiu stole the motor from the Great Shanghai Industrial Company on Jumen Road, and Ajiu pawned it at Fengtai Pawnshop for 25 yuan. They also stole forty packages of rayon from the Jifeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, camel hair from the Lixing Factory, etc. At No. 8 Qingyu Lane, Xieshi Road, Ding Arong, a native of Shaoxing, was arrested. At the same time, they went to arrest Xie Jifa and Shan Ajiu, but they were not found. Only Xie's mistress, Xie Liu, was brought to the bureau. Together with the French police, they recovered the stolen goods from Fengtai Pawnshop on Lanai Road: 27 pounds of camel hair, one motor, 39 packages of rayon, and 7 pieces of steel material. The stolen goods were identified and claimed by the respective victims. The arrested thieves were handed over by Branch Chief Yao to the Third Section of the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>The Case of Shi Jiurong: Interrogation of the Kidnappers; Shi Resigns and Goes to Beiping After the Incident; Zhang Sanjiuzi Suddenly Changes His Testimony</h3>
<p>Shi Jiurong, a native of Ningbo and head of the sales department of the Meitong Motor Company at the intersection of Foch Road and Route Mercier, was kidnapped at 9:00 AM on April 18th of this year. He was traveling from his residence in his own car to the Meitong Motor Company for work. Upon arriving at the front of the building, four kidnappers suddenly rushed up to attempt to kidnap him. However, the attempt was unsuccessful because the Indian police officer manning the traffic light noticed the event, sounded an alarm, and the kidnappers got out of the car and fled in all directions, firing shots while resisting arrest, wounding the Indian police officer in the leg. As a result, one of the kidnappers, Tian Dazhong, was shot dead by patrol officers from the British and French concessions at the intersection of Route Ratard and Avenue Alber. After the incident, on the 24th of last month, Jin Jiulin, the chief inspector of the French Concession police, received a tip from an informant and arrested Zhang Sanjiuzi (39 years old, pulling rickshaws for a living and residing in a flat in Lujia, Nanshi), an accomplice of the kidnappers from Funing, on Route Lanwei. He was sent to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and detention for investigation. All details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the victim, Shi Jiurong, resigned from Meitong Company immediately after the incident and took his family to Beiping to make a living. The police investigation of Zhang's crime has been completed. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wang Gangxu of the Second Special District Court presided over the trial in the Second Criminal Court. Fei Xizhen, a lawyer from the Police Department, presented the case, prosecuting him for extortion under Article 347 of the Criminal Code. Subsequently, Zhou Buguang, an investigator, reported the arrest and investigation of the defendant. First, Li Alin (44 years old), Shi Jiurong's chauffeur from Yangzhou, testified that at the time, four kidnappers came, one holding a pistol, pointing it at my chest and telling me not to move, and one behind slapped me once not letting me raise my head. Later, because the car would not start, the police officer and a Russian mechanic in front of the door noticed, the kidnappers got out of the car and fled in all directions. At the time I was stunned and didn’t recognize the kidnappers. I do not recognize the defendant in this case. My right ear was deafened at the time and has not recovered. Next, Tian Zonglang, the informant, who is also the younger brother of the deceased kidnapper Tian Dazhong, testified, 24 years old, living at 219 Ankang Lane, Guangzhao Road, Zhabei, making a living pulling rickshaws. My brother Tian Dazhong was always in his hometown and came to Shanghai in January of this year. Later, Zhang Sanjiuzi often came to my house, sometimes several times a day, introducing my brother to an “old man” to recommend business. On the twelfth day of the third month of the lunar calendar, Zhang came to my house, had lunch, and at one o’clock, called my brother out together, and he never came home after that. Later, I heard people say that the appearance and clothing of the kidnapper who was shot dead was the same as my brother, but I did not dare to recognize him. I looked for Zhang for many days. One day I met Zhang in the rickshaw company on Hengfeng Road and asked him where my brother was. He said that he had already returned to Jiangbei, and he had sent him to the dock. I wrote a letter home to ask my mother, and recently a fellow villager came to Shanghai and said that my brother had not returned home. I looked for Zhang again but couldn't find him, so I went to my uncle Tian Yao to inquire. My uncle knows Zhang and knows where he is, so on September 22nd, he reported to the police station, took out more than a dozen photos of the deceased, and recognized the photo of my brother. Later, the detective arrested Zhang. Tian Yao's testimony was the same. When Zhang Sanjiuzi was interrogated, he flatly denied calling Tian Dazhong out and did not know about the kidnapping. He repeatedly cried injustice. He said that he had been pulling rickshaws in the Ma Sanhe rickshaw company at the eastern end of Xieqiao. On April 18th, he worked the early shift, going out at 6:00 AM and handing over the shift at 12:00 PM. The judge asked, "Were you sentenced to eight years in prison by the Provisional Court for a robbery case in 1927?" Zhang replied yes. At this point, Detective Zhou reported that the defendant had confessed at the police station that when the kidnapping took place, he was standing guard nearby, that a retired chauffeur from the Meitong Motor Company named Lao Qiang had drawn the line, and that the instigator was Li Zongqing, who lived in a flat in Qing'an Lane, Fangxie Road, and that the ringleader was Sun Xiaowuzi, who lived at 76 Route du Père Labour. When they went to arrest them at the addresses, they had already fled. The confession made by the defendant at the police station was recorded in a statement submitted to the court for inspection. The judge interrogated the defendant again, who still firmly denied confessing to participating in the kidnapping at the police station. The court reviewed the confession and ordered that the interrogation be adjourned to the 26th. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Assassination of Tang Jiapeng: Examination of Gu Zhuxuan's Mental Illness; Investigation by the French Concession Police and Prosecution by the Court; Gu Flatly Denies at the First Trial</h3>
<p>—The Court Appoints Famous Doctors to Examine Whether Gu Has Mental Illness—</p>
<p>Tang Jiapeng, formerly manager of the Great World entertainment complex and a native of Dinghai, nicknamed A Yu, was assassinated at 1:20 AM on June 18, 1933, when returning home from work at the Great World. As he walked out of the Great World with two or three friends to his car at the entrance, he was suddenly shot by several thugs, sustaining five bullet wounds and dying instantly at the age of 44. At the same time, a passerby, Wu Guangcai, was killed by a stray bullet. A month or so after the incident, the French Concession police successively arrested two criminals from Funing, Zhang Tinggui, also known as Xiao Sizi, and Zhao Guangfu from Yangzhou, and seized a pistol used by Zhao to kill Tang. As a result of the prosecution, Zhang was sentenced to 20 years in prison and Zhao to life imprisonment. After appeals, the sentences were finalized. During the execution of the sentences, Zhao reported to the French Concession Police Department that Wang Xinggao was the mastermind of the case. The police dispatched detectives to arrest Wang at the Central Hotel on December 13 of last year. After interrogation by the Second Special District Court, Wang was sentenced to life imprisonment. Wang refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. After two court hearings, the evidence is currently under investigation. During this period, Zhao Guangfu submitted a petition to the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, accusing Gu Zhuxuan, the owner of the Da Chan Stage and a native of Yancheng, of instigating murder, and requesting that he be summoned for interrogation. After receiving the petition, the court had Judge Zhang Chaozuo open a court session and bring the self-prosecutor Zhao to the case, informing him that the crime of murder did not comply with the self-prosecution procedure and should be reported to the Police Department for public prosecution. The self-prosecution was ruled inadmissible. Zhao immediately complied and reported to the French Concession Police Department. After the Police Department interrogated Zhao, it requested the Second Special District Court to issue an arrest warrant for Gu Zhuxuan. At noon on the 10th of last month, Chinese and Western detectives went to the First Special District Court with the arrest warrant to request police assistance. After registering, they went with detectives dispatched from the Central Police Station to Gu's residence at 9 Yonghe Lane, 222 North Xizang Road, arrested Gu, and brought him back to the French Concession Police Department. The next day, he was transferred to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and detention for investigation. On the 27th of the same month, Criminal Court President Wang Gangxu, together with Prosecutor Wang Ren and Clerk Zheng Rong, specially opened the First Criminal Court for trial. The lawyer from the French Concession Police Department prosecuted Gu for instigating murder in accordance with Articles 29 and 271 of the Criminal Code. Tang Youmei, the younger sister of the deceased Tang Jiapeng, also hired a lawyer to file an incidental private lawsuit, seeking damages. When Gu Zhuxuan was interrogated, he flatly denied instigating murder and claimed that he did not know the accuser Zhao Guangfu or Zhang Tinggui. The court then ordered that Zhao Guangfu, Zhang Tinggui, and Wang Xinggao, as well as Xue Zhenyi, who was related to the case (attempted to kill Hai Zongqi, the head of the First Rescue Team of the Red Cross, in April 1932, and was sentenced to seven years in prison and is currently serving his sentence), be brought to the case and interrogated one by one. The court adjourned the hearing, stating that it still needed to investigate the evidence in the case. The defense lawyers for the defendant Gu Zhuxuan, Xue Dubi, Wu Kaisheng, and Lin Dawen, stated that the defendant suffered from psychosis while in custody, making it inconvenient to delay medical treatment, and requested permission to grant bail for him to seek medical treatment outside. The court said it would wait for a decision. It is now known that the court attaches great importance to this case and has specially invited a German doctor, a well-known psychiatrist in Shanghai, and the court's medical officer to go to the Guangci Hospital a few days ago to conduct a detailed examination of Gu Zhuxuan, which lasted a long time before returning. It is said that the court will wait for the expert opinion of the medical officer and others to be submitted to the court for review before it can set a date for the retrial.</p>
<h3>Another Creditor Sues Ou Jiancheng Et Al.; Lin Kanghou Granted Dismissal; Part of Ou Jiancheng's Case Rejected</h3>
<p>—The Presiding Judge Also Announces the Reasons for the Judgment—</p>
<p>Ou Jiancheng, the general manager of the Yong'an Silver Company, which has already gone bankrupt, and Lin Kanghou, a director of the company, were sued by creditors for embezzlement and fraud. The First Special District Court sentenced Ou to one year in prison and Lin to a fine. The trial of the other directors of the company who could not be summoned was suspended. Now, two more creditors, Liu Keshan and Shi Chengde, jointly sued Ou Jiancheng, Lin Kanghou, and Zhang Zilian for fraud. The First Special District Court opened a court session yesterday afternoon with Judge Xiao presiding. Only Lin Kanghou and his defense lawyer appeared in court. Ou and Zhang, the two defendants, failed to appear despite being summoned. After the plaintiffs stated the process of the deposit being embezzled, Lin's lawyer immediately defended, stating that Lin was neither a shareholder nor a manager of the company, but only a nominal director, and should not be held responsible. He requested that Lin be found not guilty. Lin also stated that he was also one of the victims. He felt very aggrieved by the fine imposed on him last time. He had never received a criminal penalty. As for whether he should be liable for repaying the debt, it should be determined after the Civil Court determines his status as a director. After questioning, Judge Xiao immediately announced that Lin Kanghou would be dismissed. The plaintiff's incidental civil lawsuit against Lin Kanghou was rejected, and part of Ou Jiancheng's case was not accepted. The trial of Zhang Zilian's case was suspended. Judge Xiao also announced the reasons for the judgment in court, stating that although the civil lawsuit against Lin was rejected today, it did not prevent the plaintiff from filing an independent civil lawsuit in the Civil Court. Ou Jiancheng had previously been sentenced to imprisonment, and the facts of the crime now sued were completely the same as the previous case, so it would not be accepted again. As for Zhang Zilian's address being unknown and never appearing in court, the trial had been suspended previously, so the case would remain the same.</p>
<h3>Japanese Dance Hall: Italian Sailors Resort to Violence; Flee Without Paying for Dance Tickets; Two Japanese People Beaten</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese newspaper "Japanese Daily News," at 9:30 PM on the 7th, three Italian sailors entered the Lion Dance Hall on Zhaipu Road. They first drank a bottle of beer and then danced with the dance hostesses. After about an hour, they wanted to leave. The dance hostess said that the tickets paid were not enough for three, and asked them to pay the difference. The sailors did not care. When they were walking to the stairs, they suddenly bumped into two Japanese expatriates, Fukami and Oda. The sailors immediately beat Fukami violently. Oda saw this and stepped forward to stop them, but was also affected. The sailors saw that blood was flowing from the mouths and noses of the two and knew that they had caused trouble. They quickly took rickshaws and fled south. By the time the police from the Japanese Consulate General arrived after hearing the news, the sailors were gone. They took the victims to Fumin Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Yiyixuan, a Historical Institution, Raided for Gambling and Smoking; More Than a Dozen Men and Women Together Gambling; Two or Three Addicts Enjoying the Pleasures of Opium</h3>
<p>—Smokers All Detained and Sent to Court—</p>
<p>The Yiyixuan General Association at 5 Sanhe Lane, 412 Jiangxi Road, was founded during the reign of Emperor Xuantong at the end of the Qing Dynasty, nearly 30 years ago. The members of the club are mostly wealthy Cantonese merchants in Shanghai, and political figures occasionally visit when they are in the mood. Because the club holds a special permit, the police authorities consider it a high-class entertainment venue, so they rarely inspect it. However, recently it has turned into a den of gambling and smoking, with people gambling and smoking day and night. Anyone who is not a member of the association can enter to gamble and smoke. Xu Shuyong, a head constable from the responsible police station, and Jiang Shangpei, a detective, secretly investigated and confirmed this, and requested the First Special District Court to issue a search warrant. They rushed to search the premises at 6:30 PM on the 7th. More than a dozen men and two fashionable women were gambling intensely. The famous Southern singer Jiu Xuebing was also among the gamblers. In addition, there were opium addicts Wang Shaoli, Hu Tian, Zhang Guo, Tan Gui from Yangzhou, all lying on beds, enjoying the pleasures of opium. The head constable and others immediately took the four smokers, along with six opium pipes, four opium lamps, 145 and a half taels of opium paste, and two jars of opium ash, back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court, where Judge Qian interrogated them. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer from the police station, stated that Wang and Tan were accused of violating Article 6 of the Anti-Opium Law, and Hu and Zhang were accused of violating Article 11 of the Anti-Opium Law. He requested an investigation. The defendants Wang Shaoli and Tan Gui one said he worked as a bookkeeper at the club, and the other said he was a tea server at the club. All the opium paste was brought by the members themselves to smoke at the club. Hu Tian flatly denied having an opium addiction, and Zhang Guo admitted without hesitation to smoking opium. After reviewing the confessions, the court ordered that the two defendants Wang and Tan be detained pending further investigation. Hu Tian was found not guilty, and Zhang Guo was fined 60 yuan, which could be commuted to one day of labor service for every two yuan. Before the execution, he was sent to an opium addiction treatment hospital for 20 days of abstinence. The opium paraphernalia was confiscated.</p>
<h3>The Meifeng Liquidation Office: Refunds Small Deposits; Checks Have All Been Sent Out</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, the Meifeng Bank Liquidation Office moved from its original address at 29 Nanjing Road to the Dalai Building on Guangdong Road on Sunday. The bank's deposits of less than 50 yuan were previously decided to be repaid in full. Now the checks have all been sent out, so the procedure is nearing completion. According to liquidator He Fu, the liquidation of the bank will take about two years to complete, because many huge assets cannot be easily converted into cash, and debts owed to the bank cannot be easily collected. If it is rushed, the interests of the depositors will be sacrificed.</p>
<h3>Opium Offenders in Concessions: All Sent to Municipal Hospital for Abstinence; After 20 Days of Abstinence, Sent Back to Court for Execution</h3>
<p>The city's anti-opium campaign has been organized by the Municipal Government's Anti-Opium Committee, which has selected prominent Shanghai figures as members to plan and implement the campaign. The Municipal Public Security Bureau is registering opium addicts. The government and the people are cooperating to eliminate opium addiction within the specified time. However, the first step of the work can only be implemented in the Chinese area. Opium addicts within the concessions cannot be ordered to register according to regulations. These people compare themselves to those living outside the law, with opium addiction a deeply rooted habit, stubbornly refusing to change. This has led those originally living in the Chinese area to think that the "Peach Blossom Spring" is nearby and to move to the concessions. If each goes its own way, the prohibition will be lax and the differences will be significant. Even if opium addiction is eliminated in the Chinese area in the future, the number of opium addicts in the concessions will increase, hindering the progress of the anti-opium campaign and violating the original intention of eradicating opium completely. Mayor Wu Tiecheng had already seen this problem, so he repeatedly discussed cooperation with the authorities of the Public Concession to implement a solution. Fortunately, the foreigners also recognized that the opium disaster urgently needed to be eradicated and agreed to work together to help us complete the anti-opium plan. After obtaining the understanding of the concession authorities, Mayor Wu immediately sent a letter to the First Special District Court, notifying it that after adjudicating opium cases in the future, the opium offenders in the case should first be ordered by the police to be sent to the opium addiction treatment hospital run by the Municipal Government for 20 days of abstinence. After the term expires, they should be sent back to the court for execution of the imposed penalty. This measure has been implemented since yesterday. Opium addicts in the concessions may be able to avoid registration, but if they are detained, in addition to being punished, they will also be subject to abstinence treatment. It is hoped that opium addicts will voluntarily quit, because today, talismans are really not to be relied on.</p>
<h3>Health Bureau Requests Appropriation: Rebuild the Municipal Shanghai Hospital; Design Similar to the Municipal Central Hospital; Equipment Also Expanded; Budget Requires 100,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau, due to the dilapidated buildings and simple equipment of the Municipal Shanghai Hospital on Duojia Road in Nanshi, has specially requested the Municipal Government to allocate about 100,000 yuan for the demolition and reconstruction of the hospital and the expansion of equipment. The design is currently being actively drawn by the architect of the Municipal Central Construction Committee. It can be completed in two months and will be put out to tender. It is heard that the design of the hospital is similar to that of the Municipal Central Hospital, so not only will the construction project be large, but the equipment will also be more complete than other hospitals in the city. It is expected that after the completion of the hospital, the patients in Nanshi will feel much more convenient.</p>
<h3>French Concession: Tram Lines 17 and 18 Return to Original Route</h3>
<p>The roads on Route Lafayette and Route de Marche (near Taiping Bridge) in the French Concession have been rebuilt and raised by the Public Works Department of the French Municipal Council. Tram lines 17 and 18 of the French Tram Company have temporarily changed their routes, turning from Route Lanwei to Zhao Zhou Road, which connects the Chinese area and the French Concession, and going north directly to the Great World. Southbound vehicles still travel on the original route. Now that the roads have been completely completed, tram lines 17 and 18 have returned to their original routes yesterday, turning from Route de Marche to Rue de l'Avenir, going out of Nanyang Bridge to the north, directly to the Great World, and entering the Public Concession.</p>
<h3>North German Company Transfers the "Stuttgart" from the Atlantic to Replace Service to the Far East; Construction of Third New Ship Delayed; Postponed for One Month Before Launching</h3>
<p>The North German Company is building three new high-speed 18,000-ton ships to increase the frequency of express mail ships to the Far East. The two ships that have been completed and launched are the "Scharnhorst" and "Potsdam." The name of the third ship has been decided to be "Gneisenau," which is the same style as the previous two ships and is a sister ship on the Europe-Asia line. The third ship "Gneisenau," which runs the Far East Express between Germany and China, was originally scheduled to officially join the Europe-Asia line on December 4th. Because of the launch of the three new ships, the North German Company will suspend five passenger ships originally traveling to the Far East, namely the "Saar," "Derfflinger," "Fulda," and "Trier." However, the third ship, the "Gneisenau," cannot be launched on December 4th due to construction in the dock. But the schedule has been arranged, and a mail ship must come to Shanghai this month. Now the local branch of Melchers &amp; Co. has received a telegram from the North German Company in Bremen, Germany, that the new ship "Gneisenau" must be postponed for one month before it can be completed and launched. The special express mail ship scheduled for December 4th has now been decided by the company to have the "Stuttgart," a first-class mail ship sailing on the Atlantic Ocean, replace it. The ship has a net tonnage of 13,397 tons (ship shown in another picture), and the passenger accommodations inside are also very beautiful, similar to the three new ships, but the speed is 18 nautical miles per hour, which is slightly slower than the express ships. It is scheduled to depart on December 4th and come to Shanghai, without stopping at Rangoon or Penang along the way. After arriving in Shanghai, it will not go to Japan, but will stay in Shanghai for three days and then return to Europe. As for the new ship "Gneisenau," it has been rescheduled to come to the Far East on New Year's Day next year.</p>

<h3>City Government: Strictly Prohibits Civil Servants from Riding for Free</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government, in order to strictly prohibit civil servants from riding vehicles for free, issued a special order to all its affiliated agencies yesterday, regarding a case reported by the Public Utilities Bureau stating that the Beijing-Shanghai-Suzhou Private Long-Distance Bus Company Joint Association reported, "Upon investigation, member long-distance bus companies have preferential treatment for military and police personnel riding their buses. As for local party and government agencies, it is also common to provide complimentary tickets, which has been a long-standing practice. Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial Government investigated the aforementioned situation and issued a public notice prohibiting the practice, except for military and police personnel who are allowed to purchase half-price tickets. The Municipal Government has always strictly prohibited free rides. Now that the Provincial Government has explicitly banned it and the provincial and municipal routes are connected, for the sake of convenient implementation, we have copied the original text of the Provincial Government's public notice and submitted it to your bureau, requesting you to forward it to the Municipal Government to reiterate the previous order so that all companies can comply, which would be in the public interest." Attached is the public notice of the Jiangsu Provincial Government and a notice from the Highway Administration Office of the Department of Construction, stating that commercial long-distance bus companies often issue free tickets indiscriminately to curry favor with local party, government, military, and police personnel. This kind of behavior not only hinders the company's operations but also relates to the discipline of civil servants, which is quite inappropriate. Now that the Jiangsu Provincial Government has issued a strict prohibition, our city should follow suit. It is proposed that your director, in conjunction with the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, issue a public notice to prohibit this practice in order to maintain business and rectify discipline. Is this appropriate? We have copied the public notice of the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the notice from the Highway Administration Office of the province and submitted them for your review and implementation." Upon review, the matter concerns the maintenance of transportation, and it should be approved. In addition to sending a letter to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters to jointly issue a public notice and separate orders, this order is hereby issued for your compliance. This order."</p>

<h3>Owner of Xianda Silk Store, Zhou Qixin, Sued for Issuing Bad Checks; Defendant Absent Without Reason, Rescheduled for Retrial</h3>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that Xianda Silk Store, located at No. 9, Lane 6, Huashunli, Tongfu Road, is a sole proprietorship owned by Zhou Qixin from Wuxian County. In June of this year, Zhou issued a check for 413 yuan payable on July 10, drawn on his account at the Jing'an Temple Road branch of the Shanghai Bank, to Renji Silk Store, located in Longxingli, Xiangfen Lane, North Zhejiang Road, which is now closed and being liquidated, to repay part of the debt for goods. Upon presentation, the bank refused to pay due to insufficient funds. Ni Lanping, the manager of Renji Silk Store, repeatedly negotiated with the issuer, Zhou Qixin. Zhou attempted to offset the check amount with debts owed to him by Mao Pengnian, an employee of Renji Silk Store. Ni argued that according to commercial custom, private dealings were irrelevant to the business, and according to Article 10 of the Negotiable Instruments Law, the obligor of a negotiable instrument may not assert against the holder any defense based on his own dealings with the drawer or a prior holder. Ni believed that Zhou Qixin issued a check that was not honored upon maturity and attempted to offset it with private debts, which was clearly improper. Therefore, he retained lawyer Zhang Shijie to file a criminal self-accusation with the Shanghai First Special District Local Court, requesting that Zhou be punished for issuing bad checks, and also filed an incidental civil suit. At 2:00 PM yesterday, Judge Huang Daxi heard the case in Criminal Court No. 5. Lawyer Zhang Shijie and the accuser, Ni Lanping, arrived on time, but the defendant, Zhou Qixin, did not appear, nor was he represented by a defense attorney. After Judge Huang questioned the accuser, lawyer Zhang stated the intention of the prosecution and requested that the defendant be strictly summoned to court, as the defendant had been legally summoned by the court but failed to appear without a valid reason. The court ordered that the case be rescheduled for retrial at 3:00 PM on October 26, pending the defendant's appearance. The court was then adjourned.</p>

<h3>Shanghai's First Literacy School Operations (5)</h3>
<p>— Wu Tiecheng</p>
<p>5. Prospects for the Second Session of Literacy Education</p>
<p>Promoting [literacy] is an innovation in most provinces and cities. This city has a responsibility to do its best. The large-scale nature of this undertaking means that the government cannot bear all the material and human resources alone. Borrowing and utilizing school buildings and equipment are unavoidable in practice. Those who cling to old habits and make excuses to shirk responsibility are expected to discard their personal prejudices and fully support this undertaking. We hope that everyone in the society will work together to promote this undertaking. This is the first hope for people in the society. The Literacy Education Committee has set up offices in various districts, with various committees such as investigation, publicity, and academic affairs. The goal is to gather the wisdom of the Party, government, police, and schools and turn them into a strong force. However, in the beginning, they are able to engage in the work earnestly, but over time, they may become complacent. As the saying goes, "Make the beginning, make the end." We still hope that they will maintain their initial enthusiasm and be truly responsible. This is the second hope for the responsible people in each district. The quality of teachers greatly affects the students' interest in learning and their learning efficiency. Most of the teachers in this city's literacy schools have been selected and trained and should be able to fulfill their duties happily. However, according to reports, there are also a few who are perfunctory, do not seek improvement, or have improper teaching behavior, or even use force or rely on police force. It is important for teachers to guide and influence students with their personality. They should improve their moral character and seek improvement in teaching in order to set a good example. They must not be casual or perfunctory, resulting in shoddy work. In addition to establishing reward and punishment measures and strict assessment, we still hope that all members will strive to improve themselves. This is the third hope for teachers. As mentioned earlier, past inspections have been conducted. In the future, in addition to continuing to conduct inspections as before, full-time inspectors will be assigned to supervise the process. Special attention should be paid to the review of results, both during the normal course and at the end of the term. However, education should progress step by step and emphasize consistency to achieve consistent results. This is the fourth hope for inspectors at all levels to work hard. According to the situation of the first literacy schools, there are quite a few private schools. If they can seriously handle all aspects of teaching and supervision and continue to run them, so that quality and quantity have the same progress, then the power of society to assist the government in promoting this undertaking will also be considerable. As for the service team approach, it is not without feasibility in principle, but the reason why the effectiveness is not obvious is that the methods still need to be carefully considered. We should continue to consult and seek improvement. This is the fifth hope for those who are enthusiastic about literacy schools to continue to move forward. The number of graduates from the first municipal private literacy schools will be more than 60,000. In order to continue to advance the studies of those who are ambitious and the general qualified students, starting from the second session, each school will add a class of advanced literacy classes, and plans to run popular literacy reading materials, so that they can review the old and learn the new, and achieve lasting results. This is also the sixth aspect of this city's promotion of literacy education, which emphasizes the consistent and complementary approach. Starting from the second session, the teaching time will be extended to three months, and the substitute cadre system will be abolished, giving teachers a day off every two weeks, so as to take into account the facts, so that teachers can rest and students can learn fully, so as to improve teaching and gradually improve the results. To teach hard and learn hard, the achievement should be practical. This is the seventh hope for teachers and students to strive even harder. (End)</p>

<p>Letters to the Editor</p>
<p>Sir: I read in the news column of your newspaper an article about a Japanese man beating a rickshaw puller to death, stating that the rickshaw puller, Wang Deyuan, was from Taizhou, and that his family had reported to the fellow-countrymen association for assistance. Wang Deyuan is from our county, and his sister, Chen Wangshi, asked the association for assistance. The association convened a temporary meeting to decide on measures: (1) send a letter to the Japanese Consul General to punish the murderer, (2) provide compensation, (3) ensure that similar incidents do not happen again, (4) in addition to the public prosecution part, which will be filed by the police station, the association will also appoint lawyer Song Shixiang to represent the victim's family and pursue compensation for damages in accordance with the law.

<p>Qinghai Athletes Participating for the First Time</p>
<p>General Leader Speaks: The Qinghai athlete delegation attending the Sixth National Games arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. The reporter interviewed the team's General Leader, Zhang Deshan, at the sports field. According to Zhang, the team's instructors, Zou Guozhu, etc., arrived in Shanghai this morning (i.e., yesterday morning) by train from Beijing to participate in the Sixth National Games. This is the first time Qinghai athletes have participated in the National Games. Participating in the National Games is to present the entire spirit of Qinghai to Chinese and foreign people, to show national unity, and to bring back the excellent sports skills of the country to prepare the Qinghai public, to make them aware of the importance of sports, and to actively promote it, to build the foundation for the revival of the nation. This is the greatest hope of the Qinghai delegation. Qinghai is located on the frontier, and the ethnic groups are very complex. All ethnic groups have participated in this selection. The athletes' skills and achievements are quite good. Although it is expected that they will not be able to win in this competition with the national athletes, they are also fortunate to come to the conference for an observation, so as to encourage the athletes, and their achievements will be improved next time. Please also give more guidance from national sports enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Complete Team List: General Leader Zhang Deshan, Instructors Wu Shijin, Administrator Shi An, Track and Field Athletes Chen Sanguang, Zhang Dingzhao, Ji Yuankui, Zhou Wenqi, Zhang Shengshou, Zhang Qiquan, Zhong Wanshi, Zhang Yongshun, Yang Wenjiong, Chen Xianda, Mu Hetian, Zhao Lianji, Zhang Shenshan, Wa Defu. Basketball Team Members: Yang Wenjiong, Chen Sanguang, Li Hongzhang, Chen Xianda, Zhao Lianji, Zhang Shenshan, Wa Defu, Chen Xueli, Mu Hetian.</p>
<p>Xikang's Track and Field Results Are Remarkable</p>
<p>The Xikang team, which has never participated in the National Games, recently trained thirteen athletes two months ago to encourage the people there to be interested in sports and participated in this conference, led by General Leader Ma Zezhao. They arrived in Shanghai at 2:30 PM yesterday and immediately reported to the organizing committee.</p>
<p>Ma Zezhao Speaks: According to Ma, speaking to reporters, Xikang is located in a remote area, and the people there hardly know what sports are, especially modern sports. Other old-fashioned sports, such as horse riding and shooting, are still relatively common. As for swimming skills, they are almost the best in the country. The best can stay in the water for several days without any change, but unfortunately, the posture is not suitable and cannot be reported to the conference. There is also a skill of throwing stones. Usually, everyone can throw 60 meters away, and they can hit the target 100% of the time within 60 meters. The funds for participating in this conference were all raised from donations from various places. The purpose is not to win medals, but purely to see the skills of all-around athletes, so that the local sports can be improved upon returning to Xikang.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Strength: The team fully participates in track and field. The list is as follows: General Leader Ma Zezhao, Instructor Zhao Guji, Administrator Sun Qinghua, Track and Field Athletes Mu Chenghua, Ma Shujun, Jia Maosen, Gao Guogui, Li Wenbi, Yang Changbo, Wang Xinlong, Wang Fude, He Qichang, Guo Zheng, Jia Maosen, 100 meters in 10.8 seconds, Mu Chenghua, 200 meters in 22.4 seconds, Wang Xinlong, 400 meters in 52.4 seconds, Wang Fude, 1500 meters in 5 minutes and 26 seconds. The results are quite remarkable.</p>
<p>Fourteen Mongolian Knights</p>
<p>The unit's athletes, a party of fourteen, led by General Leader Enhe Amur, arrived in Shanghai by train from Beijing at 8:00 AM yesterday and arrived in Shanghai at 3:00 PM. According to the team's General Leader, Enhe, speaking to reporters, the original Mongolian sports skills are characterized by horsemanship, shooting, and wrestling. Western sports are still in the early stages of learning. Most of the athletes participating this time are students from Mongolian and Tibetan schools and military schools. They are still interested in basketball, but they have no confidence in track and field. This time, they are just observing others. Except for the eight wrestlers who are still on the way, the rest of the team has arrived. The list is as follows: General Leader Enhe Amur (representative of the Mongolian Local Autonomous Political Affairs Committee), Instructor Fang Wuyi, Administrator Zhang Pengzhou, Athletes Zhang Tianbao, Niu Yukun, Wang Fumin, Ba Zhanyuan, Tong Wen, Guo Zhenfang, Rong Zhao, Wang Yunwen, Yun Zhanbiao, E Shuzhong, Ma Zhaoxi, Tong Hu Xue Xingru, Chen Baoting.</p>

<p>Xinjiang Representatives Arrived Yesterday from Beijing</p>
<p>The Xinjiang delegation, consisting of twelve members, led by team leader Gong Bicheng, took the train from Beijing at 8 AM yesterday to Shanghai. The delegation includes General Leader Gong Bicheng, Instructor Zhang Qing, Administrator Sheng Yan, and athletes Mu Weixin, Ha Weixin, Su Jingxin, Ni Zuxin, Hai Huanxin, Wu Fanxin, Ou Nianxin, Pei Ziliang, Li Guanying, Han Zhenhua, and An Chongwen, participating in track and field and swimming. According to General Leader Gong, speaking to reporters, the people of the province have always been physically strong, and all ethnic groups in the province, such as the Hui, Kazakh, and Mongolian, are proficient in riding, shooting, swimming, and wrestling. As for various techniques for riding through high mountains and wilderness, they are particularly skilled. Track and field and other sports have only been promoted in recent years. This is the second time Xinjiang has participated (the first time was in 1933). On the one hand, it is to see the excellent athletes from all over the country for reference, and on the other hand, it is to let people across the country know that Xinjiang people are the same as other provinces and cities and can participate in various events. Although they do not hope to win any medals, they want to show the people of Xinjiang's interest in sports and the spirit of bravely attending the meeting. In addition, some of the province's athletes arrived in Beijing half a year ago, and some are students studying in Beijing, so they all came from Beijing yesterday.</p>
<p>Ms. Hu Yueying, the niece of painter Hu Zaobin, is eleven years old. She won first place in the Guangdong Yangtze River swimming competition and was selected as a Guangdong athlete to attend this National Games. She came to Shanghai with her father, Hu Yugui, to participate in the conference yesterday.</p>
<p>Beijing Has the Most Confidence in Basketball</p>
<p>The Nanjing delegation, consisting of 176 people, led by General Leader Chen Jianru, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning on the 8:00 AM express train. They arrived at the North Station at 2:30 PM and immediately reported to the organizing committee. According to the team's General Leader, Chen, speaking to reporters, all athletes in Beijing participating in the National Games completely emphasize sportsmanship, morality, and discipline, and do not take winning or losing as honor or disgrace. They observe each other's techniques to seek improvement. The team's basketball strength is very strong, and they hope to win a championship at the National Games.

<h3>Considerable Strength, Few Highlights: Malayan Chinese Soccer Team Wins Against Youth Team with a Score of 3-0. The Youth Team Lost 2 Goals in the First Half. The Malayan Chinese Team Has Average Talent, but the Coordination Does Not Seem to Be Perfect.</h3>
<p>The Malayan Chinese soccer team, attending the National Games, played a friendly match against the Youth soccer team yesterday at Shen Garden. However, the weather was uncooperative yesterday, with drizzle falling continuously. As it had not stopped by 3:00 PM, the National Sports Advancement Association believed that the competition would be difficult to complete due to the rain. Approximately four to five hundred soccer fans were let in. At 3:10 PM, the Malayan Chinese team finally arrived slowly, and ticket sales then began. Those who arrived early took great advantage of the situation. After defeating the Shanghai representative team, the Youth team was ambitious. Although they lost to the Malayan Chinese team yesterday, it was not their fault, but rather that their strength was slightly inferior. The score was 2-0 in the first half and 1-0 in the second half. The details of the battle are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Opening Record</p>
<p>After the Malayan Chinese team kicked off in the center, they surged into the Youth defense like a landslide. The Youth team was not weak, and they desperately resisted the enemy. They managed to barely survive several dangerous moments. However, the Malayan Chinese team continued their efforts, and Yao Shenghua scored a goal, opening the record. The Youth team then tried to counterattack, but to no avail. Shi Cheng intercepted the ball in the middle and passed it to Xu Buyun, but he failed to break through the defenses.</p>
<p>Youth Pleases the Crowd</p>
<p>The Malayan Chinese team was not polite and bravely advanced. Guan Xinde took a long shot, and Xin Ziliang satisfied with his head to save it, but unexpectedly, the top of the head was dull, reflecting it into the goal. Gu Biao inexplicably lost his territory and let it into the net. Hu Yizhong was assisted by Jiang Zhaoxiang and attacked forward, but was saved by Zhen Lin.</p>
<p>Flowering on the Top</p>
<p>The battle resumed, Zhao Aisheng kissed the ball with his hand, and the referee enforced the law like a mountain. Xie Qingfu took a high shot and kicked it away, but Gu Biao caught it. Luo Douwen received a pass from Liu Zukan and shot it high outside the goal. Hu Yizhong had an excellent opportunity, but his header was too high. Zhao Aisheng showed his skills and saved Adou. Du Yadi passed to Xie Qingfu, flowering on the top, creating a total result of 3-0, the road of the Malayan Chinese team.</p>
<p>Observing Strength</p>
<p>The Malayan Chinese team did not field their official lineup yesterday, but their strength was still considerable. The talent is very average, but the coordination is not yet pure, and the footwork is also unfamiliar. Several times they could have won but did not. Judging from yesterday's actions, they were not as good as Hong Kong. Perhaps the first battle will not be very exciting. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Malayan Chinese Team</p>
<p>Huang Jinbai</p>
<p>Zhen Anlin Lin Xifu</p>
<p>Lin Zhiquan Xie Qige Li Yiyao</p>
<p>Lin Yadi Guan Xinde Xie Qing Yao Zhao Yin Jinzhen</p>
<p>Youth Team</p>
<p>Gu Biao</p>
<p>Xin Ziliang Zhao Aisheng</p>
<p>Wu Zhenxiang Shi Cheng Jiang Zhaoxiang</p>

It is expected that there will be a fierce battle. In addition, there will be a mixed doubles exhibition match between Wang Wenzheng and Qiu Feihai against Yang Lunzhang and Ruan Guoying.

<p>Guangdong Soccer Team vs. British Allied Forces at Shen Garden at 3:00 PM This Afternoon</p>
<p>The Guangdong soccer team, due to the absence of four knights, Huang Jiliang, Li Tiansheng, Ye Beihua, and Hong Jingxiang, has suffered a great impact on its strength, especially in previous recordings. In order to practice, the team has scheduled to play against the British Army Joint (Innis West Mixed Team) at Shen Garden at 3:00 PM this afternoon. The Guangdong team's lineup is as follows:</p>

At 1:00 PM sharp, the departure began, led by the Eight Trigram car of Tiger Balm Wing On Tong, followed closely by the private cars of Hu Wenhu, Hu Guigeng, Lu Lihua, and others. Next came the cars carrying the athletes, totaling about 60 vehicles, proceeding in single file, resembling a long snake formation, quite a sight to behold. Citizens on the road stood and watched. After reaching the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge, the reception desk provided a tour route map to each person (with Mayor Wu's inscription on the cover).</p>
<p>Tour Route: After the official departure, the motorcade headed south to the West Gate, passed by the Chen Ying Shi Memorial Tower, and proceeded along Zhonghua Road to the Wenwen Park. Unexpectedly, the weather turned unfavorable, and heavy rain started to fall, making it inconvenient to get off the cars for a visit. So, the motorcade went from the Wenmiao Park, along Zhonghua Road, directly to Gaochang Temple to visit the Jiangnan Shipyard and the Naval Aircraft Factory. The factory director warmly received the guests and personally led them to visit various departments. Leaving the Jiangnan Shipyard, the motorcade turned onto Zhizaoju Road, passed through Jinzhou Road and Minguo Road, entered Zhejiang Road, turned east onto Nanjing Road to the Bund, turned north onto the Bund Road, turned west through North Suzhou Road, passed by the Postal Administration, and proceeded along North Sichuan Road and Pazilu. The original plan was to go to the North Station and proceed north along Baoshan Road to see the ruins of the Eastern Library and the Nanshi Library, which were destroyed in the war. Although the weather had cleared up, the visit was canceled due to time constraints. The motorcade then took Baoxing Road and Shuidian Road to the city center area and circled the City Hall. Mayor Wu stood in front of the City Hall and nodded and smiled to the athletes to show his welcome.</p>
<p>Visiting the Battle Sites: After leaving the City Hall, the motorcade entered Jungong Road, passed through Yunzaobing, and arrived at the Wusong Fort to visit the sites of the Songhu Battle. Soldiers there gave a detailed account of the battle and the destruction suffered. Once a military fortress for our national defense, today it is overgrown with weeds, a desolate scene. The overseas Chinese athletes were saddened by the sight and could not help but sigh. After leaving the fort, they returned to the City Hall to meet with Mayor Wu. In addition to offering words of encouragement to the athletes, he also hosted them in the auditorium, serving refreshments. By then, dusk had fallen, and they bid farewell and returned to the dormitories of the Liangjiang Women's School to rest.</p>

<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Announcement Regarding School Transportation Arrangements for Spectators</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Education Bureau issued an announcement yesterday regarding school transportation arrangements for spectators at the Sixth National Games, stating: "The Sixth National Games has commenced. During the Games, a large number of students will be attending as spectators, and it is imperative to plan for transportation to facilitate their attendance. After discussions between this bureau and the Public Utilities Bureau and the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus, a special train will be dispatched daily from the South Railway Station at 11:30 AM, going directly to the Sanmin Road stadium in the city center. At 6:30 PM, the train will return from Sanmin Road to the South Station, stopping at Longhua, Xujiahui, and Fanwangdu stations. This special train will be limited to 1,500 passengers per day, with a round-trip fare of 50 cents per person. Schools located in the South and West districts of the city and near the stations should use this special train if they do not have their own transportation. Schools should provide an official letter and send a representative to the South Station Master to make reservations one day before their scheduled visit to avoid last-minute rush. Additionally, during the Games, the Zhabei Business Public Bus Company will add buses on the Baoxing Road-Shuidian Road route, and there will be approximately 200 large trucks with modified seating departing from Yunli Road behind Hongkou Park (south of the Sports Garden) directly to the stadium every day. Each truck can accommodate 50 people, with departures approximately every minute. Schools in and around Zhabei should be able to use these trucks. Furthermore, there are steam trains from the North Station on Songhu Road that go directly to the stadium, with a fare of 15 cents per person per trip. Those traveling from Wusong to the venue will need to change trains at Gaojingmiao. This announcement is hereby issued for general knowledge." Issued on October 8th, 1935 by Director Pan Gongzhan of the Bureau.</p>
<h3>Games Referees Meeting Today at 3:00 PM at De Lin Apartments</h3>
<p>All Games referees are scheduled to meet at 3:00 PM today at De Lin Apartments (separate arrangements for national martial arts referees). Badges, order books, special competition regulations, and various competition rules will be distributed at the same time. Due to limited seating at the apartments, line judges for tennis and volleyball are only requested to collect the above items for use during the Games, and attendance at the meeting is waived. The meeting will be divided into two groups: one for track and field, all-around, and swimming, and the other for ball games, each occupying one floor (as the same floor cannot accommodate so many people). In addition to reporting matters, Mr. Zhang Boling will be invited to give a speech on "The Responsibility of Referees." Subsequently, the head referees will lead small group discussions separately (e.g., head referees for various ball games, finish line referees, field referees, head timers, inspectors, chief recorders, etc.) in the hope of enhancing the effectiveness of service.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Track and Field Team Loses to Chih Chih College</h3>

<h3>Fudan's 30th Anniversary Celebration: Second Day's Grand Occasion</h3>
<p>Exhibition of Achievements Extremely Substantial, Football Match Brothers Very Courteous, Photography Achievements Excellent, Music Delightful</p>
<p>Fudan University in Jiangwan, celebrating its 30th anniversary, has a special three-day holiday for celebrations. The grand and solemn ceremony was held the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the exhibition rooms were still open as usual. After lunch, there were two major activities: a football match and a musical performance. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Achievements: This time, each department has an exhibition of achievements, located in Jian Gong Hall, the newspaper exhibition, the photography exhibition room, the literature, law, and business departments, and the exhibition of industrial and national goods. The science department is in Zibin Hall. The library is purely for academic exhibition. Because the content is substantial and not falsified, the true face is displayed to the society. Viewers are constantly on the road, unanimously praising it. Especially noteworthy is the newspaper exhibition, which has a rich collection of world newspapers and multiple printing presses, operating on-site, with extremely accurate statistics.</p>
<p>Photography Exhibition: The photography association does not cater to social interests with nude photos, and all are automatically enlarged. One hundred and fifty works are displayed, a feast for the eyes, too beautiful to behold. It is said that it will be extended to the 10th to avoid viewers missing out.</p>
<p>Football Match: The football match was played in the rain. With a whistle from the referee, the brothers began to cross legs. The students of our school are young and strong, running very fast. The alumni are old but their knives are not dull, and they are exceptionally slippery. Everyone did not compete for victory or defeat, but went back and forth, very politely, until the sky was dark, then they sounded the gong to call it a day.</p>
<p>Musical Performance: The school's music group includes five teams, including a singing team, a string orchestra, and a harmonica team. The singing team has participated in off-campus performances several times, and the string orchestra has also performed once, both receiving social praise. The joint performance last night was truly rare. No wonder the gymnasium was packed. After the meeting, the sound of the zither and songs lingered, evoking the feeling of lingering sound for three days. It is said that there will be a Peking opera performance tomorrow night, and it is expected that the grand occasion will be no less than this.</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony of Denghui Hall at Fudan Affiliated High School</p>
<p>The Affiliated High School of Fudan University in this city, in commemoration of Dr. Li Denghui's thirty years of service to Fudan, held the opening ceremony of Denghui Hall during the celebration of the school's thirtieth anniversary. The number of participants included former school principal Ma Xiangbo, Ambassador to Germany Cheng Tianfang, Special Zone Court President Guo Yunguan, Zhejiang Provincial Government Secretary-General Huang Ermin, Education Bureau Representative Chen Bai, International Labor Bureau China Branch Director Cheng Haifeng, guests Zhu Shaoping, Su Er, Principal of McLaren Middle School Shen Tilan, Gu Tianfang of Nanyang Middle School, representatives of the Board of Directors Jiang Yiping and Zhu Zhonghua, representatives of the Alumni Association Xi Yushu, and the school's University Secretary-General Jin Tongyin, Business School Dean Li Quanshi, Law School Deans Zhang Zhirang, Zhang Youliang, Sun Hanyong, and Gu Zhongyi, old classmates Bi Jingqian, Zhu Yizhou, Song Xiquan, Wu Falai, alumni of the affiliated high school, and more than 600 people. The ceremony was presided over by Yin Yiwen, director of the affiliated high school. After reporting the purpose of the meeting, Principal Li Denghui himself performed the unveiling ceremony. At that moment, firecrackers and applause rang out. Then Ma Xiangbo gave a speech, explaining that the meaning of Denghui Hall is to ascend to the path of light. Principal Li, Director Chen, Jiang Yiping, Guo Yunguan, Huang Ermin, Xi Yushu, Shen Tilan, and Cheng Haifeng gave speeches successively. The ceremony was completed.

<h3>Little Men (7) (0)</h3>
<p>— Original by Ms. Alcott of the United States, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>Chapter 5: The Mischievous Little Girl</p>
<p>One day after class, Mrs. Pei saw Mr. Pei and said, "Frederick, I have a new idea."</p>
<p>"Oh, my dear, what is it?" he said, listening attentively to her new plan, because many of her ideas were so humorous and absurd that one couldn't help but laugh, but they were generally quite reasonable, so he was happy to implement them.</p>
<p>"Little Mei needs a companion. It would also be good for the boys to have another girl to accompany them. You know, we believe in cultivating little men and little women together. Now is the time for us to put our ideals into practice, and we can't delay any longer. They either treasure Little Mei too much or abuse her, and her temper has already deteriorated as a result. They should know how to be gentle and refined, how to treat people with courtesy. To achieve this, it is more effective to have girls around than anything else."</p>
<p>"You are really insightful. Which one should we recruit now?" Mr. Pei asked, knowing from his wife's expression that she had already prepared a candidate to propose. So she replied:</p>
<p>"Little Annie Howe."</p>
<p>"What! Is that the one the children nicknamed 'Naughty Nan'?" Mr. Pei asked in surprise, looking like he was about to laugh again.</p>
<p>Announcement: The "Little Men" manuscript will be temporarily suspended from October 10th to October 20th during the 6th National Games. Readers please note.</p>

<p>Special Issue for the 15th Anniversary of Meiya Silk Weaving Factory</p>
<h3>Eulogy</h3>
<p>— Zhang Gongquan</p>
<p>Silk is an essential item for human life. In the past, it was made by hand, but now it is made by machine. The difference in speed and quantity is known to everyone. Since the opening of the sea, steamships have frequently arrived. There are many kinds of cloth, and the value is cheap. There are even more kinds of silk, and the value is even cheaper. In the past, the products of Wu and Yue were almost completely taken away, and the annual loss of profits overseas cannot be counted in tens of thousands. During this period, enlightened people quickly started to catch up, competing to purchase machinery and establish factories to try to save the situation. The gains and losses varied, and it was not necessarily guaranteed to win. However, Meiya Silk Weaving Factory is different. Its planning is meticulous, its equipment is complete, its products are of high quality, and its patterns are novel, all of which are unmatched by other factories. Moreover, it can persevere with perseverance. In the past ten years, it has expanded from small to large, and from separate to combined, with a vibrant and promising atmosphere, which is truly admirable. I hope that its products will be promoted from within the country to beyond the country, from Asia to Europe and America, so that everyone will praise and admire them, and praise our silk products as the best in the world. Isn't that wonderful? Now, with the special issue for the 15th anniversary, I am happy to write this preface to encourage them.</p>

<p>The invention of silk dates back tens of thousands of years in China. Since the opening of the sea, it has occupied the first place in exports, enjoying a reputation in the world market and leading the way for a time.</p>
<p>In recent decades, due to the improvement of silkworm breeds, the advancement of weaving, the brightness of dyeing, and the invention of artificial silk by foreigners, all have made rapid progress, so that Chinese silk has been declining day by day in foreign markets.</p>
<p>In the entire foreign trade war, we are indeed retreating steadily. However, in the history of struggle in these decades, the Chinese silk industry also has many glorious warriors. Meiya Silk Factory is one of the most famous.</p>
<p>Now, Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, with its hundred battles, is holding its 15th anniversary celebration. Recalling the past glory of the Chinese silk industry and admiring the history of Meiya Silk Weaving Factory's right to fight, we sincerely hope that Meiya's efforts will maintain the silk industry and, even more, that Meiya's innovation will lead to the prosperity of national production.</p>
<h3>Managing the Economy to Benefit the World</h3>
<p>— Lin Sen</p>
<h3>A Review of the Factory's 15 Years</h3>
<p>— Cai Shengbai</p>
<p>It is difficult to start a business, and it is not easy to maintain it. In the competition of industry and commerce in the 20th century, it is not just about maintaining it. If you don't advance, you retreat. If you don't win, you fail. There is no such thing as success or maintenance. Maintenance means no progress, and no progress means inevitable elimination. Since the establishment of this factory, fifteen years have passed in a flash. Looking back at the initial establishment, the roads were rough, there were only a dozen machines, and only a few kinds of products. Compared with the current achievements, the spring of 1920 is no longer the same. At that time, the machinery was not as good as it is today, the technology was far from as good as it is today, and the methods of promoting sales were far from as good as they are today. However, the needs of the general public for high-quality, exquisite materials were not as high as they are today, and the standard of living was not as high, and there were not as many practitioners, and the competitiveness was weaker, which is also not as good as it is today. Therefore, with the factory's machinery and technology in the past, applied to the past era, it was more than enough to be at ease. It is appropriate that everything went smoothly, the number of machines increased day by day, exports increased day by day, and sales also increased day by day. The foundation of the factory has also gradually been consolidated, from the fifth anniversary to the tenth anniversary, to reach today's fifteenth anniversary. Today is different. Not only are there more and more people engaged in the silk industry, but also talents are emerging in large numbers, and technology is improving day by day. The national material desires and the standard of living are increasing day by day, but their purchasing power, due to years of disasters, famines, wars, and endless trade deficits, has made their purchasing power lower and lower. Therefore, only by making the products more refined and reducing the price step by step can the products be easily sold. How can the cost be reduced? How can the technology be improved? This is the important answer to the present. Therefore, I say that it is not just about maintaining the status quo, but about thinking deeply and seeking progress. I, Shengbai, joined this factory in the spring of 1921, and have been managing everything for fourteen years. Today, I am happy to celebrate the fifteenth anniversary, and I especially feel that the impact of the silk weaving industry on the national economy and the people's livelihood is huge. From mulberry planting and silkworm breeding to silk sales, there are almost 100 million people who depend on it for a living, directly and indirectly. However, the silk weaving industries in Europe, America, and Japan are all above our country, whether in machinery or technology. If we do not catch up quickly, we will undoubtedly fail. If the entire silk weaving industry fails completely, where will the livelihood of these 100 million people be entrusted? The progress of this factory in the past fifteen years, in terms of turnover, although it has increased seventy times, but looking at other practitioners in the domestic industry, those who have not been able to keep pace with this factory and develop together, I feel that the factory's future responsibility is even more serious, and I cannot congratulate myself and be satisfied. The process of technological management and business development of this factory in the past fifteen years can be roughly divided into four periods. The first period was before 1924, when everything was new and initial, and it was all in the early stages, and had not yet reached the stage of advancement. The second period was between 1924 and 1927, when the foundation was established, talents were refined, and gradual progress was planned to seek development. The third period was from 1928 to 1931, when the country was peaceful and the people were safe, so a high-sighted view was taken, and the degree of rapid advancement was almost a thousand miles a day. The fourth period is from 1932 to the present, when times are difficult, the people are poor, and everything is declining. This factory is no exception. It has endured hardships and worked hard day and night, not seeking quick success, and it can barely maintain its position. Looking back at the first period, it was still newly established, and everything was limited by things, and was all of an experimental nature. The founder, Mr. Mo Shangqing, was also running other businesses at the same time, and did not have time to devote all his efforts to this. Therefore, he invited Shengbai to join, reorganized everything, slightly increased capital, added American machinery, stipulated management regulations, and determined business policies, so that the company was on track and began to move forward. However, at that time, the silk weaving industry had not yet made significant progress, and had not broken away from the norms of handicrafts. Therefore, what Shengbai stipulated was only his personal ideal, which he obtained through experience, and he did not dare to say that the blueprint of Europe and America would be suitable for China. He only gradually eliminated the obstacles that were not conducive to the development of the silk weaving industry, in order to lay the foundation for future in-depth research. Moreover, at that time, the domestic economic power had not yet shown signs of exhaustion, and there were not many practitioners. Therefore, although it was in the experimental period, there were few signs of things going against wishes, which eventually led to three or four new products not only being popular in China, but also selling well in Southeast Asia, such as velvet fabric, No. 6 ge, etc., and the business has not declined to this day. These are all extremely memorable achievements in the first period. In the second period, the previous experimental period did not fail, and the excellent results enticed the factory to consider how to expand its business. Therefore, on the one hand, it increased the number of branches, improved technology, and added various high-end products to meet market demand, and prevented the import of high-end silk fabrics, and determined the factory's front-line goal, which was to recover the loss of silk fabrics, and to ensure that domestic silk fabrics and imported silk fabrics stood in an irreconcilable position. Moreover, the factory's organization was a joint-stock enterprise, and the number of branches increased day by day, and the management of personnel had to be carefully considered in order to seek the effect of unified command and increase its effectiveness. Therefore, the General Management Office and the General Distribution Office were established, and each department was subordinate to them, so that they could cooperate and coordinate, and there was no bias or universality. Therefore, the quality of exports has also been improving day by day, and the increase in turnover compared with the first period is six to one. Even in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang sales area alone, compared with the first period, it has increased by more than 30 times.</p>
<p>The beginning of the third period coincided with the success of the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army, the National Government laid its foundation in the capital, and everything was rejuvenated, with a vibrant atmosphere. The factory followed the environment of the times, first thoroughly reforming personnel management, and deeply felt that if political affairs were wise and bright, then all undertakings would also advance. The factory did not dare to close its doors and build cars, so it first established a trial institute, specializing in research and experimentation. On the one hand, it independently invented new products, and on the other hand, it specially dispatched technicians to imitate new European and American products. As a result, the manufacturing factory was able to devote itself to manufacturing, without having to seek invention at the same time, and the types and quantity of products increased even more. At that time, domestic transportation became increasingly convenient due to the government's lack of keenness in construction, and even remote areas were easily connected. Therefore, the factory sent many dedicated personnel to organize exhibition groups, set out to promote, year after year, without regard to cold or heat. The Chinese silk fabrics are as brilliant and radiant as imported ones, and even women and children know it. Since the factory takes the revival of domestic silk fabrics and the recovery of trade deficits as its premise, and at the end of this period, the operators of silkworm businesses in Jiangsu and Zhejiang were failing due to the failure of export sales, and the farmers who planted mulberry trees and raised silkworms were abandoning mulberry trees and planting other crops due to losses, and the factory felt the importance of its responsibility even more. Therefore, it drastically increased production in order to ensure that the silkworms that could not be exported to foreign countries could be consumed in China as much as possible. Fortunately, the factory's efforts to promote sales in the north and south finally succeeded. In 1930, the turnover suddenly increased to more than 5 million yuan. However, the social demand increased sharply, and even though the factory's more than a dozen branches and factories were rushing to produce day and night, they were still worried that the supply would not be enough. They were deeply concerned that the quality might be uneven. The reputation of one factory is small, but the rise and fall of the entire domestic silk fabric industry is related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, so they set up an inspection institute and installed various machines to specialize in pre-inspection of silk and post-inspection of silk. All silk of different qualities is classified and used, so that after the silk is made, each quality meets the required standards. All silk fabrics with slight defects are removed and stored separately, and the reasons for the defects are studied, so that the same mistakes will not be made again. In addition, with the increase in production and the increasing number of personnel, a training institute was established to specialize in training various talents, so that workers and administrative personnel could make the best use of their talents.</p>
<p>The fourth period is that the previous period's rapid progress has achieved great results, and the factory is planning to formulate new plans to seek a major move. However, there were sudden droughts in various places, and the September 18th and January 28th incidents suddenly broke out, leading to the bankruptcy of rural areas, the decline of all industries, and the social economy falling into distress. The purchasing power of the people has also become weaker day by day. Due to the decline in demand for silk, not only is it not easy to expand sales, but also the price has plummeted, which is rare in previous years. The factory has a vast scope and a large number of employees, and cannot afford to hesitate. Therefore, in order to strengthen its strength, in the spring of 1933, the factories were merged and reorganized into a limited company, so that management would be more rigorous and comprehensive. On the one hand, various new products were improved and invented, and on the other hand, various consumptions were saved. Even bamboo heads and wood chips were not abandoned, so that costs could be reduced. Unexpectedly, this year, due to the tight money supply and the floods in various places, it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain industry and commerce. The factory's colleagues have to agree to endure hardships and work together to fight, and they firmly believe that planning things depends on people, and success does not depend on heaven.</p>
<p>In summary, in the past fifteen years, in terms of the number of machines, the factory has advanced from more than twenty machines to thousands of machines. In terms of the number of people directly employed by the factory, it has advanced from more than fifty people to more than 3,000 people. In terms of products, it has advanced from two or three kinds of ordinary silk fabrics, such as velvet fabric and silk fabric, to velvet, georgette lace, silk yarn, and four-shuttle box three-axis fabrics. In terms of turnover, it has advanced from tens of thousands of yuan to 6 or 7 million yuan. In terms of sales areas, it has advanced from Jiangsu and Zhejiang to various countries around the world. All of these are enough to be the obvious major achievements in the factory's history, which can be described. However, the European and American silk weaving industries are developing a thousand miles a day, and their scale is greater than this. In fact, the factory is still insignificant. Moreover, in recent years, the domestic economy has not been prosperous, and the Yangtze River and Yellow River floods have turned the land into a swamp. Rural areas have gone bankrupt, and their vitality has been greatly damaged. The silkworm industry has fallen by a thousand feet, and the wind and rain have been continuous, with few sunny days. How to maintain the status quo in the future, how to strive for self-improvement, in order to complete the task of recovering trade deficits and helping the domestic silkworm industry, I, Shengbai, am not talented, and I still dare not say that there is a quick solution. However, for fifteen years, the entire staff of this factory has built this foundation together, and they are all willing to work hard, strive to be strong, persevere with perseverance, and be persistent with determination. If we are fortunate enough to be taught by the gentlemen of the country, we will be deeply grateful and eager.</p>

<h3>Factory Operating History</h3>
<p>Our factory was established in the spring of the ninth year of the Republic of China. The initial factory was located in Jiuchengli, Xujiahui Road, French Concession, Shanghai, with only 12 electric looms. In the spring of the tenth year, Mr. Cai Shengbai returned from Lehigh University in the United States with a bachelor's degree in engineering and served as the general manager. He increased capital, added machines, recruited talents, reformed management, and expanded business. Moreover, in view of the old silk weaving machinery in China, in the eleventh year, he first adopted American Otto-type silk winding machines, parallel head machines, thread reeling machines, and Cromwell-style all-iron electric looms to imitate the most fashionable European and American silk crepe, such as velvet fabric, Fangaihua fabric, double crepe, and single crepe, etc. The products were even better than foreign goods, and the sales volume increased sharply as a result. The industry competed to imitate, and the silk weaving industry was renewed. With many looms in our factory and fast delivery, orders from home and abroad came one after another, and the business grew rapidly. In the autumn of the thirteenth year, the second branch was opened on Jiaotong Road, Zhabei. In the spring of the fourteenth year, the Tianlun Meiji branch was established on Xiaoshadu Road. In the fifteenth year, the Meifu Factory was established on Du Shenfu Road. Also, in order to improve the lives of employees, the employees invested in the Meicheng Factory on Xietu Road. At the same time, the Tianlun Meiji General Factory was also established on Xietu Road. In the eighteenth year, the Meili Factory was established on Gonghe Xin Road, Zhabei. Moreover, in view of the fact that the original factories were not able to fully equip themselves, the Mesheng Factory was specially established on Quzhenren Road, Nanshi. The world's most sophisticated machinery was purchased, and the most complete factory buildings were built. All equipment, management, manufacturing, etc., adopted the latest European and American methods. It specializes in weaving various novel and high-end products, such as georgette and Palace, etc. The quantity and quality of the products have been greatly improved, and the sales are even more prosperous. In that year, the Nanxin Factory was established on Xujiahui Road, and the Jiulun Factory was established on Yokohama Road. These are the general outlines of the expansion of the scope and the increase of affiliated silk factories over the years. As for the auxiliary work such as printing, dyeing, and refining, the Meiyi Dyeing and Refining Factory was established in the seventeenth year. All the goods produced by the weaving factories were refined, dyed, and printed by this factory. In the same year, the Meizhang Pattern Making Cooperative was established to specialize in making various pattern plates for the weaving factories. Moreover, the weaving factories have successively increased the number of looms, and the area for expansion is insufficient. Therefore, in the twentieth year, the warp and weft departments of the factories were separated and the Mei Jing Weaving Factory was established to concentrate management and prepare in large quantities. Therefore, the warp and weft weaving, pattern making, dyeing, and refining are all handled by specialized factories, and the division of labor is specialized and refined. The products can be completely standardized, and the credibility of the supply market is increasing.</p>
<p>Our factory was originally a partnership organization, and in the spring of the twenty-second year, it was reorganized into a limited company with an authorized capital of 2.8 million yuan, which was fully paid up at one time. The internal organization and management were greatly reformed after the reorganization. In addition to renaming all the weaving factories as Meiya Branch Factories and numbering them in order, the weaving and dyeing factories were renamed with the Meiya character. The Meizhang Pattern Making Cooperative was renamed Meiya Pattern Making Factory. A general management office was established as the administrative center of the company. The general manager is stationed here to handle affairs. There are six departments under the office, including general affairs, technology, business, finance, procurement, and design, and a secretarial office. Each department is under the command of the general manager and assumes special responsibilities. The factory managers are responsible for the factory affairs and are responsible to the general manager. Moreover, in order to deliberate and develop all the undertakings of the entire company, the general management office convenes various meetings on a regular basis to openly discuss the progress of the undertakings without any isolation or laxity. In addition, three institutes for training, inspection, and experimentation were established. The training institute specializes in the training and guidance of employees. Every employee must undergo strict training before being formally assigned to a position. Other events related to workers' night schools and all sports, entertainment, libraries, and workers' welfare are all handled by the institute. The inspection institute specializes in the inspection of raw materials and finished and semi-finished products. The experimental institute specializes in the research, analysis, and even experimentation of various new fabrics. The establishment of the three institutes is of great benefit to the improvement of personnel and products. The factory organization was completed at this point. All members are working hard in their respective positions, and the work efficiency has been greatly increased. Our factory may be one of the general large factories in China that are magnificent in scale and have the best production for a time.</p>
<p>Our factory currently has 1,200 looms and ships more than 1,000 pieces of goods per day. It is sold in various ports at home and abroad, and the supply is often not enough to meet the demand. There are more than 600 kinds of products, and all kinds of silk fabrics that are popular in all seasons are available. New products are still launched from time to time to meet the needs of the times. Such as velvet, lace yarn, and jacquard georgette, etc., there were no domestic products before. Since our factory first invented and woven them, it has opened a new era in the domestic silk weaving industry. And with the acceleration of production, the rational management, the product cost is reduced, and the selling price is also particularly flexible. The products of our factory are of high quality, low price, and beautiful colors. It is not a fluke that they are popular everywhere and are welcomed by people everywhere.</p>

<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Xiao Bai)</p>
<p>A flint won't spark without friction, and similarly, the flame of people's lives won't ignite unless they encounter stimulation.</p>
<p>Often, many people don't discover their own "strength" until they're impoverished and have nowhere else to turn. Adversity and tribulation can help them awaken their "self." Hardship and obstacles are like forging one's life into a beautiful hammer and axe. Only failure, only difficulty, only the light struggled for in the darkness can make a person strong and invincible.</p>
<p>Therefore, we shouldn't see all obstacles and tribulations as enemies; on the contrary, we should regard them as benefactors. We can grasp the core of these obstacles and temper our ability to "overcome obstacles."</p>
<p>The words "fate" are untenable; they can never stop us from striving forward!</p>
<h3>Burying Oneself in Work Versus Understanding the World</h3>
<p>— Wu Yuxiu</p>
<p>Young people should be full of vigor. Never be discouraged by some frustration. Look at the great figures and entrepreneurs of the past and present; who didn't emerge from arduous struggle? When they were unsuccessful, how were they despised and looked down upon? But contempt and disdain only served to strengthen their will and effort.</p>
<p>Society is snobbish. When you achieve success and fame, those who once looked down on you will change their tune and praise you. Therefore, when you are determined to move forward and bury yourself in hard work, let others laugh and curse as they may. Uphold an indomitable spirit and simply work hard. That is the path for today's young people. If you do so, your future will surely be bright.</p>
<p>Often, many people initially intend to pursue a career, but because their ambition is not firm, "every effort is obstructed," and they become half-hearted. Gradually, their aspirations erode and they become "overwhelmed by lethargy," losing enthusiasm for everything they do, just as the saying "understanding the ways of the world" suggests.</p>
<p>This is partly caused by the environment, but partly it is due to one's own abandonment and inertia. By the time "old age arrives" and "time is no more," it is already too late for regrets.</p>
<p>It is evident that young people must avoid the habit of "eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die," and not fail to invigorate themselves. Understand that time does not stand still. When it comes to "being a person," one must clearly recognize the word "being." "Understanding the ways of the world" is a shortcut to deceiving oneself.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is the Double Tenth National Day of the 24th year [of the Republic of China]. I dare to share this speech, “Burying Oneself in Work Versus Understanding the World," with the readers for mutual encouragement.</p>
<h3>Chalk</h3>
<p>— Yan B.G.</p>
<p>When a teacher enters the classroom to teach, in addition to speaking and gesturing, they rely on chalk to convey words and sentences that cannot be described through speech alone. Therefore, being a teacher is also called a chalk career.</p>
<p>The living expenses of modern elementary school teachers are so meager that it is difficult to maintain a personal life, especially in rural elementary schools, where teachers' living expenses, including food, are only ten yuan per month, which is simply forcing teachers to change careers! Many people are therefore unwilling to eat chalk dust anymore.</p>
<p>Speaking of chalk, in some schools, the principal limits teachers to using only one stick of chalk per class. This is certainly due to the school's financial difficulties, but isn't the principal being a bit too strict?</p>
<p>Not long ago, I taught in a rural area, and several elementary school students asked me for leftover chalk stubs, which was quite troublesome every day. I asked them what they were used for. Some said they were practicing arithmetic, some said they were practicing writing new characters, and some just smiled with pursed lips. I spent a week investigating and discovered that they were using chalk stubs as tools for small gambling. They ground the chalk stubs into squares and used ink to mark "one, two, three, four, five, six," transforming them into good square dice, secretly gambling to win or lose. When they saw a teacher passing by, they quickly crushed the chalk with their palms, so the teacher could not catch them red-handed and did not know what they were doing.</p>
<p>After I discovered this, I sternly warned them that gambling is not something good students should do, and they must adhere to the principle of not gambling! After that, no students asked for chalk stubs anymore.</p>
<h3>Achievements of the Past 24 Years!</h3>
<h3>Four-Year-Old Quits Smoking and Drinking</h3>
<p>— Gong</p>
<p>In West Berlin, New Jersey, USA, there is an infant who has just turned four years old, who used to be addicted to smoking and drinking, but has now quit.</p>
<p>This child, named Michael Norman, has loved smoking and drinking since he was three years old. A year ago, Michael took a photo of himself with a large cigar in his mouth, looking very sophisticated, like an adult. This photo was published in the newspaper, and as a result, many letters, like snowflakes, were sent to the Norman home, all from anti-smoking associations and moral reform groups from all over the world.</p>
<p>Michael's grandmother was very moved by these letters, so she started to get him to quit smoking and drinking. According to her proud expression, Michael now only smokes on Sundays, and as for alcohol, he has completely stopped drinking it.</p>
<p>If Michael secretly smokes on another day, then his six-year-old sister, Peach Green, will tell his grandmother, who will immediately force him to throw it away.</p>
<p>Michael is very healthy, with golden curly hair, and his father is a machine worker. His grandmother said that a doctor in New York saw his grandson's addiction in the newspaper and found it very strange, so he came to see the child. As a result, he said that Michael's parts were normal, there were no abnormalities, and he was stronger than other children his age.</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 20: Fighting for Life to See the Beloved Grandson, Embracing Each Other and Weeping, Recalling the Past During a Famine, Sowing Wheat and Inviting Disaster</p>
<p>Shi Lian said, "I just came to the back door once, and it has nothing to do with me if this old lady is sick." Sister-in-law Hu said, "We are not saying anything about your master, we are just asking your master to do a good deed and bring that person out to see her. There is a saying: Saving a life is better than building a seven-story pagoda..." Shi Lian listened to her words, but his eyes were fixed on the old lady. He saw that the old lady's head was slightly tilted and kept swinging forward. Her full head of white hair was blown by the wind and kept falling on her face. Although her eyes were open, the strength of her eyelids was very small, and it could be seen that she was struggling hard, but still could not avoid the tragic sight of them drooping. Shi Lian thought, even if she doesn't die like this, it won't be long. It's best for me to slip away, so he nodded to Sister-in-law Hu and said, "Good, good, I'll tell Master Jia the news and definitely let him release Madam Jia to see her." His words were more powerful than a shot of stimulant for the patient. The old lady immediately said, "Master, if that's the case, you've done a great thing. I'll wait here." Shi Lian felt that things were a bit inconvenient when he heard the dry voice and the intermittent sentences, so he turned around and walked towards Little Western Paradise. Unexpectedly, when he arrived outside Jia Duocai's house, he happened to be entertaining guests, and the sound of their conversation was continuous, coming from inside. He deliberately passed by the window and glanced inside, and saw Yueying lowered her head and huddled in the corner of the room. He thought to himself, if I were to go in and report this unfortunate news at this time, not only would Jia Duocai be unhappy, but the guest would also find me insensitive. (336)</p>
<h3>The Drifting Fragrance of the Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>That evening, knowing that I still had to attend to the Empress Dowager's bath, I respectfully followed her into her bedroom, along with four maids who also entered slowly. At that time, because I did not know what I was supposed to do, I was very flustered, and at first I thought I would have to directly help her take a bath. After a while, I realized that it was the four maids who would directly help her take a bath, and I only needed to stand by and supervise and give pointers. In fact, I had never worked in a bathhouse, so how would I know how to give them such and such pointers? Fortunately, the Empress Dowager did not really want me to take care of her. She liked to take charge of everything, ordering people around haphazardly. How could she relax about this bathing and let the four maids scrub her haphazardly? So in fact, every time we were sent in to "serve" her bath, it would be more accurate to say that we were sent in to "watch" her bath.</p>
<p>First, two eunuchs carried in a large wooden tub, but this tub was definitely not the kind of wooden tub that we ordinary people could see. Although its interior was made of wood, its exterior was wrapped in a thick layer of silver, so it was always very bright and shiny. The tub was already filled with more than half a tub of hot water. In addition to this wooden tub, the eunuchs also brought many clean white towels. At that time, the Empress Dowager was sitting comfortably on a low table. The back of this low table could be removed or installed at any time so that the maids could scrub her back. (433)</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Talk</p>
<h3>The Problem of Children Entering Movie Theaters</h3>
<p>— Hai</p>
<p>Recently, our education authorities issued an order stating that children under the age of six are not allowed to enter movie theaters. In my opinion, children of this age have not yet developed their intelligence and do not really understand anything. Even if they are shown movies, they will not understand them. Perhaps the reason for not allowing them to enter movie theaters is for the sake of order. In the UK, there are also restrictions on children entering movie theaters, but the age limit is higher. In the UK, some people agree with this, while others disagree. At the time, Jennie Lee, a former member of the House of Lords, published a speech stating that there was no need for such a ban. She said:</p>
<p>"I remember very clearly when the movie theater first came to my village, it was a sensational event. We children eagerly awaited the Saturday matinee. When the day arrived, we took a few pennies, pulled along many younger siblings, and rushed to the movie theater like the wind, so excited that we could hardly breathe. Ordinary seats cost one penny per person, while special seats with velvet cushions cost two pennies per person. There was a loud piano playing familiar melodies, followed by darkness, and the movie began. We shouted with joy at the sight. I still remember a car on the screen getting closer and closer, bigger and bigger, scaring a fat old lady in the front row, who jumped up, fearing that she would be hit by the car. But we children, hearing her screams, applauded and cheered, finding it very amusing.</p>
<p>"However, while we children welcomed the movie theater, our parents strongly opposed it and forbade us from going to such a bad place again. Now, twenty years later, when I think of the past, I cannot help but ask myself, should we allow children to go to movie theaters?</p>
<p>"According to my past experience, the answer is, of course, we should allow them to go. Because movie theaters are most capable of satisfying children's curiosity? Movie theaters are simply like the magic carpet in "One Thousand and One Nights," taking us to many places, meeting people from different countries, observing rural life, and studying the endless variety of machines. The movies also have funny people who make us laugh; despicable villains who make our blood boil; and the suffering in Mary Pickford's films, which make us sad and tearful, and we want to learn to comb our hair into curls like hers. What we children especially welcome are those cowboys and Native Americans in Western movies, riding horses back and forth. After watching the movies, we would run home as if riding horses, thinking we were cowboys and Native Americans, and all the games we played were often copied from the screen.</p>
<p>"Then those who oppose movie theaters will say, 'Precisely because of this, children should not be allowed to go to movie theaters. The cowboys and Native Americans have largely disappeared from the screen, replaced by the hooligans and thugs of Chicago and New York.' Children who watch these movies get a bad impression. Those children who are good at imitating, when they go home, will imitate the behavior of hooligans and thugs, treating it as a game. Isn't this very dangerous?</p>
<p>"Children's games are just games, and they will not necessarily learn the behavior of hooligans and thugs and commit crimes that violate the law. If it is for the sake of preventing trouble before it happens, then local officials and education authorities should not allow such films to be shown on the movie theater screen. Why should they deprive children of the right to watch movies because of this?</p>
<p>"Although many of the events in movies are based on fantasy, there are also many that depict the realities of human life. For example, early American films mostly portrayed the adventurous history of the development of the West, so cowboys and Native Americans were often active there. Modern American films often portray the criminal history of gangs in the city. These films can all be said to depict real life. What is most shameful is that the British film industry often imitates the bad aspects of Hollywood to produce films. Anyone with a sense of responsibility should organize and throw these films into the vast ocean, not only not allowing children to watch them, but even adults should not watch them.</p>
<p>"In short, if anyone wants to absolutely prohibit children from watching movies, I will oppose it to the end. You must know that in a few years, they will have to enter society. Whether the films are good or bad, they can give them a taste of life. When they enter society and live that real life, they can use everything they have seen in the films as reference material.</p>
<p>"If we want to purify this evil world, this filthy society, then adults should take responsibility and not do evil, so as not to be filmed and have a bad influence on children. This is the fundamental solution. As for prohibiting children from watching movies, that would be like abandoning eating for fear of choking."</p>

<p>Finance: Telegraph: American Silver Policy on the Verge of Collapse; Spot Gold Continues to Rise After Market Close</p>
<p>—Approaching 903 Yuan—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was unenthusiastic. Therefore, although the market was tight, it became weak in the middle. Later, due to the tightening of the Hong Kong market and banks continuing to buy, it finally rose. People's hearts then began to react, and after the close, it approached 903 yuan. In the early morning, overseas silver markets showed a decline in London and stability in the United States. Deferred silver prices in Montreal fell by 0.055 to 0.0105 dollars, and exchange rates uniformly rebounded. Spot gold in London fell by 2 pence, but sentiment was normal. Pre-market trading opened at 897-898 yuan. Fuxing, Yongda, Decheng, and Shangjin were buyers, exceeding 8 yuan. Yongli, Dada, Huixiang, and Decheng were sellers, retreating to 6.5 yuan. The Central Bank's hanging plaque was revealed, with London stable and the US rising. Customs gold units fell by 0.03 yuan, and the standard spot gold price was listed at 917.4 yuan, stabilizing the situation. After the opening, it remained stable. Bank buying remained strong, and Mobil Oil Company had another settlement, causing buying to increase and rise. However, due to large investors taking advantage of the high prices to supply in unison, sentiment was originally flat, and the upward trend was temporary and short-lived, immediately falling back. It was learned that HSBC's listing showed London and the US both flat. At this time, banks continued to buy, but mostly hovered. Later, bank buying slowed slightly, and the domestic market trend loosened. Sellers exerted their power and prices fell. Banks took advantage of the cheap prices to continue buying, and after falling low, turned to hover again. Reuters reported that under three conditions, it appeared that the US silver purchase policy was on the verge of collapse. It still appeared stable, and the Hong Kong market was also tight. At noon, it recovered slightly. The later market was tight due to the continued tightening of the foreign exchange market. Bank demand exceeded supply, stimulating buying, and prices gradually recovered. HSBC still blocked shillings, and soon retreated slightly, but with Indian silver reporting a reduction of 3 annas, and Hua Shang Bank buying US dollars, the situation remained stable. However, the market was flat again, lacking changes, and hovering between 897-898 yuan was rare. Indian silver fell another 1 anna, remaining stable, but the Hong Kong market softened again, and the domestic market tightened again. Large investors bought in abundance, and the close was again brisk. After the close, there were rumors of a certain bank buying US dollars and Sassoon buying pounds, further strengthening confidence, breaking through 900 yuan, and approaching 903 yuan. The market situation for today is recorded below:</p>

After the close, Hengyu, Yongli, Yuanmao, and Yongsheng sold, but Chunyuan, Yongfusheng, Yongwanfeng, Hengyu, and Richang bought strips one after another, actually rising above 902.5 yuan. Hengyu supplied strips when prices were high, retreating within 2 yuan. Decheng, etc. still paid more attention to hovering. Qingfa and Yongfuxing sold, retreating to 1.5 yuan.</p>

The highest was 899.3 yuan in the afternoon market, and the lowest was 893.2 yuan in the previous market. The fluctuation was 6.1 yuan.

After the opening, because the bank continued to buy, Mobil also settled, the process tended to be tight, but because the Hua Shang's psychology was not excited, they threw and blocked a lot. HSBC listing announced, British and U.S. both flat. The situation was hovering. Later, because the bank’s buying stalled and turned loose, but because Reuters informed that American silver faction member, Thomas, and tobacco merchants' opinion of silver policy has impaired trade, Hong Kong’s market was still tight, banks taking the opportunity to sell still buying. At noon, it was able to maintain the situation. The later market was tight as soon as it opened. The bank demand exceeded the supply, and China Guohuo etc. had a rumor of buying.

<h3>Securities: Major Bulls Unable to Exit; Bond Market Not Very Optimistic</h3>
<p>Long-Term Gold Drops Sharply, with a Maximum Drop of 0.75 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange market was depressed.

Although the market price did not fluctuate greatly, the market atmosphere was still not easy to boost. Long-term financial issues had no transactions.

<h3>Cotton Yarn Three Grades of Yarn Price Reverses and Rises High, Speculative Yarn Decline Trend Dissipates</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially declined, then rebounded, and the trend remains uncertain. Initially, it was reported that the Itailan side's attitude towards the East African war turned sharply towards peace, and that the securities firm Jin Chang had sold off a large quantity, more than 3,000 bales, in recent months, causing the market to loosen. Then, Osaka's three grades of yarn steadily rose, jumping up by several yuan, boosting confidence, and the market rebounded.</p>
<p>Gold: Morning Low, Afternoon Rebound</p>
<p>The yarn market opened with good sentiment. Near-month contracts rose, but far-month contracts suddenly weakened due to securities firms selling off, showing signs of shorting near-month contracts. Meanwhile, Osaka's three grades of yarn telegram indicated a rise of over two yuan for near-month contracts, while far-month contracts only rose by a few jiao. News of easing European war also emerged. After the second session, there was a period of decline. By closing, Rui Da's long positions bought back in, resulting in the current month's closing price falling by one yuan compared to the previous day, and far-month contracts falling by four, five, and seven jiao. After the afternoon opening, spot yarn trading was not as active as the previous day, and sentiment remained dampened. After the second session, Da Hua, a three-grade yarn, rose more than one yuan compared to the previous day.

<h3>Dongyang Bank Acts on Xihe Cotton</h3>
<p>—Forty-one Count Yarn is Out of Stock and Prices Soar—</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The Xihe cotton market in this city is strong, and Dongyang Bank is also acting. The shorts, seeing the improved environment, are actively covering their positions, so the market is good. Matsumoto &amp; Co. bought 248 bales at a price of 34.4 yuan. Wu Zhai &amp; Co. bought 250 bales at a price of 34 yuan. Shanghai firms bought 505 bales at a price of 34 to 34.4 yuan.

<h3>Liverpool Bank Takes a Position in American Cotton</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened down one to four "suiyin" in all months. Then, due to poor Liverpool telegrams, Southern sellers dumped their holdings, and the weather was good, so market prices continued to soften. However, [Business] Continent and the Far East all bought in. Later, Liverpool banks sold overseas and took positions here. At the same time, cotton farmers [strived] to reduce [output], spot merchants bought in, shorts covered, there was frost in cotton-growing regions, and the market situation [improved]. There was not much new trading because the government was about to release [figures]. Spot cotton needs were strong and the market price was firm. Finally, the market fell back due to long liquidation. Spot prices rose by five pounds sterling, and futures rose by five to fourteen pounds sterling. Spot British cotton fell seven points, and futures fell three to four points. Indian cotton speculators bought in, and Japanese merchants sold out. The market was flat overall. Aumla and White Luo Creek rose by half a rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (7th telegram):</p>

<p>New York, 7th: The total number of bales of cotton exported from Rangoon last week was six, of which two went to Shanghai and four to Kobe.</p>
<h3>Grains: The International Situation Dominates, Flour and Wheat Prices Plunge in the Morning Market</h3>
<p>The flour market initially plunged, then stabilized slightly due to reports of lower prices for foreign wheat. Chicago continued to fall by three to four jiao, and Canada fell by about four to five jiao. At the initial opening in the morning, the price of foreign wheat continued to fall, and the Italian-Abyssinian war seemed to be temporarily coming to an end, which inevitably shook the long positions. Therefore, the opening price plunged by a huge three to four fen. Due to the weak confidence in the forward months, the prices for February and March fell by a huge one jiao compared to the previous day's initial opening price. This kind of violent rise and fall was caused by international price trends. In addition, long positions were being liquidated, so more than 800,000 bales were traded in half a day. By the afternoon opening, the market atmosphere turned slightly stable. Because the bullish sentiment of outside parties increased, large amounts were pulled in, and the market was supported. After this, if foreign wheat can be approached, there will be no excessive price increase.</p>
<p>Closing on the 7th, Closing on the 8th, Comparison</p>
<p>October: 2.6925 2.6175 Down 0.0250</p>
<p>November: 2.700 2.6900 Down 0.300</p>

<p>February: 2.7775 2.7225 Down 0.0250</p>
<p>March: 2.8025 2.7700 Down 0.0325</p>
<p>Wheat prices fell sharply across the board at the morning opening, due to continued declines of three, four, and five jiao in foreign wheat quotations. The international situation seemed to be temporarily stalled, and the sale of foreign wheat was more active than before. Although the prices were not yet matched, the general public speculated that it would inevitably become a reality in the future. Therefore, after the opening price, each month continued to decline, falling by one jiao, three, and four fen compared to the previous day's initial opening price. The closing price also fell by five, seven, and eight fen. The fluctuations were quite alarming. By the afternoon opening, the market was initially flat, and then, because the spot market was tight this month, sentiment was boosted. The forward months also rebounded significantly due to the stabilization of the flour market. Subsequent movements depend entirely on changes in the international situation. The spot wheat market was seeing buying and selling, and factories were consuming, so the price of high-quality wheat rebounded by three to five fen. Shandong wheat was opened at 4.25 yuan, Yaowan wheat at 4.24 yuan, Guang wheat at 4.23 yuan, Huangqiao wheat at 4.21 yuan, and Danyang wheat at 4.20 yuan. Fuxin purchased 1,500 bales, and Xinda purchased 3,000 bales.</p>

<h3>Cloudy Weather Stabilizes Rice Prices</h3>
<p>The source of local rice (Shanghai firms) yesterday was nearly 40 firms (with a total of over 8,000 shi of goods). The sales market on this street yesterday was slightly active due to the cloudy weather again. And the factories, such as Yantai, Qingdao, and Weihaiwei, continued to buy 1,400 to 1,500 bags of new and old goods in total. The market situation stabilized, and there were no ups and downs in the quality. There were also no changes in the prices of Mi Zhong Bai Ge and other new thin rice and thick new japonica rice. As for Du Yang new pointed rice, the price was slightly lower due to a slight shortage of supply and demand, but it was stable overall.</p>
<p>7th, 8th, Change</p>
<p>Xitang Yang Tip: 8.45 8.40 Down 5 fen</p>
<p>Sijing Broken Bag: 2.48 2.48 Stable</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) The source of each route is 33 or 34 firms, and the broken white japonica rice continues to move, and the price is tightly discounted by a few fen. The arrival of Dongxin japonica rice has been sparse, and retail sales are normal. The market situation is stable. The early market for Xixin japonica rice is still [dull], and the price has also been slightly reduced. Later, due to the cloudy weather, the consumer demand has improved, and the market situation has turned tight. The new Yang Du pointed rice of thin rice is stable, and the Bai Ge kiln type is close to one jiao. There are few arrivals of Bai Yuan, and the retail demand is quite good, with the price increasing by more than one jiao. The Ningbo port tip is also closely discounted by nearly one chi. The prices of other goods are stable. It is reported that the total market opened 571 bags of Jiangxi rice, more than 2,200 bags of Ningbo rice, and two small carts of Jingxian rice. Except for the lake white rice that was purchased by the North Ocean in the evening, all were purchased by the local street.</p>
<p>The new arrival of Yang Mi from Saigon is 200 tons, and there are also a small number of returned goods from Zhejiang Province. In the morning, the local customers purchased at a normal pace, and the market saw a weak tone. But in the afternoon, the North firms had a very active demand, and the local street also competed to purchase, the number of small crushed rice opened in the morning was only over 400 bags, but more than 1,000 bags were traded in the afternoon. Saigon and Siam rice were traded for a total of 500 bags, and the market situation was active again.</p>
<h3>Sesame and Rapeseed Foreign Firms are Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign firms were active in sesame and rapeseed. It is estimated that Dongyang firms bought 3,000 bags of Pinghu rapeseed at a price of 6.5 yuan. [Western] firms [traded] 300 tons of sesame, scheduled for delivery in November and December, at a price of 9 yuan. The above are all based on old-fashioned weights. Currently, the price of foreign firms is expensive, and the situation is still strong. However, the spot sesame market has risen by more than one yuan in a week. Although the market was lively yesterday, the amount was relatively small, so the future situation may be bullish. Yesterday, the total market estimated that Fuzhou firms and Guangdong firms purchased more than 360 bags of Qingzhen sesame, and Ningbo firms purchased more than 100 bags of Jiujiang sesame. Local street firms purchased more than 120 bags of Mingguang sesame and 200 bags of Tushan sesame. Dongyang firms purchased 100 bags of Taizhou sesame and 106 bags of Dongtai sesame. Zhangba sesame 350 bags</p>
<h3>Hardware Black and White Iron Sheets Rise in Price</h3>

As a result, the spot goods on the market have been almost completely searched. The standard price has soared, and the market price has risen to 10 yuan per dan, which is a jump of 1.5 yuan compared to before, and the price of thick colored goods has also risen to 8.25 yuan, which is also 5 jiao better than before.

<h3>"Ideal Love" and "Practical Love"</h3>
<p>—Xin Ren</p>
<p>Many "young men and women" who cannot get rid of the "scholar's aura" originally wanted to "bury" their responsibilities for the "era" in a vigorous way. These people know that now is no longer the time to devote themselves to "falling in love" and "cherishing spring," but to do some actions and careers with "social significance."</p>
<p>This motivation is worth admiring. However, many young men and women who have a "recognition" begin to be excited and frenzied when they step on the road of social action, then become anxious and unbearable, and finally become passive and decadent. At this time, they want to shout but have no courage and talent, and they cannot help but hesitate.</p>
<p>This is indeed a major problem among today's "young men and women." And this problem cannot find a complete answer in some "youth education" like training.</p>
<p>However, more than half a century ago, Feodor Dostoevsky exposed this problem with "painful cruelty." In the second book and fourth section of the great novel "The Brothers Karamazov," a high monk Zosima, who should now be honored as "Living Buddha," said that a doctor once confessed to him in this way:</p>
<p>"I love mankind, but there is one thing that surprises me. This is nothing else, that the deeper I love mankind in general, the less I love individual human beings. In imagination, the matter of contributing to mankind has reached almost strange ideas, as if one can carry a cross for mankind at any necessary opportunity; but on the contrary, I cannot spend two days with anyone in a house together. This is known from experience. As soon as someone is close to me, his personality immediately oppresses my own self-esteem and freedom. So I can even hate those with outstanding personalities in just one day and night. Some eat for too long, and some have a cold and constantly sniff, which makes me hate. In short, as soon as people come into contact with me, I immediately become his enemy. Conversely, the deeper the hatred for individual human beings, the more enthusiastic the love for all mankind follows."</p>
<p>This doctor's confession is not just a sharp scalpel toward himself, or simply toward "us." High Monk Zosima (who is of course Dostoevsky's "gramophone") explained that this is "ideal love" as opposed to "practical love." He said:</p>
<p>"Practical love is almost terrifyingly difficult compared to ideal love! Ideal love hopes for rapid success and wants people to see it. In fact, there are some extreme people who want to make it successful without delay, like the ones shown on the stage, so that everyone admires it; even if they lose their lives because of it, they will not hesitate. However, when it comes to practical love, there is nothing else but labor and patience!"</p>
<p>The so-called "labor and patience" here should be meaningful only when one leaves the "position of slave philosophy." This remark of Dostoevsky is similar to the words in the "New Testament" "Matthew's Gospel" Chapter 23, verses 3-7 of the "Bible."</p>
<p>"...They can say but cannot do. They bind heavy burdens that are hard to bear, and lay them on people's shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to move a finger. They do everything to be seen by people, and make their phylacteries broad and their tassels long. They love to sit in the best seats at feasts and in the highest places in synagogues, and love people to greet them in the marketplaces and to call them Rabbi, Rabbi."</p>
<p>Of course, this type (the "scholar" is the "scholar" of today—and the "Pharisee") mentioned in the "Bible" is different from the type mentioned earlier, but it cannot be ignored. Conveniently, here one can perhaps catch a glimpse of Dostoevsky's "spiritual connection" with the "Bible"; on the other hand, one can also know that although the "Bible" has always been revised and embellished, it still protects many immortal and brilliant lights to this day.</p>
<p>The shift of the center of gravity of love from the personal love of "falling in love" and "cherishing spring" to "the love of all mankind" is a progressive process. History has used countless lives and blood to awaken general "young men and women" from their "pink dreams." But once awake, the drowsiness is still there, and the darkness is long in front of you. Here the problem becomes a problem.</p>
<p>We may as well listen to the precepts of that high monk Zosima: "The most important thing is to avoid hypocrisy, all kinds of hypocrisy, especially hypocrisy to oneself. Observe your own hypocrisy, every hour—no, every minute, to discover it!"</p>
<p>The so-called "observing one's own hypocrisy" does not mean that we should leave everyone and spend the whole day hiding in the house staring at our own noses. Without examining all our actions in behaviors related to social mankind, we cannot obtain "self-knowledge" and "self-salvation."</p>
<p>The contradiction between "ideal love" and "practical love" is manifested in the duality of thought and behavior. The characters in Dostoevsky's works are all suffering in the contradiction of this duality. This duality is certainly the inheritance of their environment, but it is not an irreconcilable defect. If Dostoevsky also knew that "God" is ourselves, then he would not give such illusory and almost desperate hopes to his many protagonists who are in the "underground room" and suffering from "crime and punishment."</p>
<p>Among us "scholars," generally, the more those who speak, the more they have this kind of "duality of love." But—"Why do you see the splinter in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the splinter out of your eye,' when there is a log in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the splinter out of your brother's eye." ("New Testament" "Matthew's Gospel" Chapter 7, verses 3-5.)</p>
<h3>Let the Death Knell Sound! (Prose Poem)</h3>
<p>—Mu Zhi</p>
<p>Let the death knell sound—</p>
<p>The radio on the street plays jazz, flirtatious tunes, and vulgar Cantonese music with squeaks and crashes: that is the curse of the desperate, the delirium of those with popular fever, the exhausted groans after wild beasts mate, the carnival night before suicide... Listen, the dying giant is singing his own requiem!</p>
<p>Let the death knell sound—</p>
<p>The rhythmic sound of doorplates! The pulse of this metropolis! Breaking through the silence of the deep night. Main streets, alleys, here, there, all echoing this sharp and monotonous magic music. The cursed people gradually return to silence from shouting, laughing, and scolding! Deathly silence! They stare at each other with vengeful eyes, staring blankly at the dice of fate, holding their breath and listening to the drops of life's blood dripping away. What they occasionally [win] is money, but what they lose is their limited and boring lives. Listen, the dying giant is wielding the hoe and shovel himself, building his own tomb!</p>
<p>Let the death knell sound—</p>
<p>Here, the name of Buddha is murmured, and there, the scriptures are sung loudly: here, serpent spells are written, and there, solemn Dharma assemblies are held. Sorcerers fly with covetous salivation, and good men and women kneel and offer their blood and flesh. Ghosts and foxes are exposed, and wandering souls and zombies play on the streets. Good, good! The giant in the sickbed has heard the last prayers and is being exorcised!</p>
<p>Let the death knell sound—</p>
<p>Preachers put on a stern face and [recite] the doctrines on paper, and priests diligently advise others to do good; the delirium does not forget the glory of the past, and ancestral fake antiques are caressed in the hands of bankrupt households. Listen, the dying giant is dictating his will in the last moment of his life! Isn't the death knell still ringing?</p>
<h3>Market</h3>
<p>— Zigan</p>
<p>The auction houses, noticed and frequented by a segment of savvy individuals.</p>
<p>This is a "market," a "market" for those who have money left over after covering their living expenses. It resembles the ancient tradition of alternating-day markets, but separated by a chasm of money. It's like comparing a farmer's rough cigarette for relieving fatigue to a fine cigar held in a white hand while reclining on a sofa.</p>
<p>Advertisements are the cornerstone of credibility for merchants, tirelessly broadcasting auction dates daily in black and white – excellent opportunities for everyone to strike it rich.</p>
<p>Outside the large glass windows, shrewd eyes linger, hoping to discover something worthwhile. If you ask the managers, they will gladly tell you with boastful exaggeration. This inspires comforting dreams for some customers in the days leading up to the auction.</p>
<p>If the weather is clear, the auction house fills with people early in the morning. Aside from some easily inspected wooden furniture, every eye is eager to examine each item from the first to the last – miscellaneous household items, clothing of fine material but slightly worn, exquisite and ingenious toys, bundles of assorted medical books…</p>
<p>Speculation, caressing, hesitation—</p>
<p>A greasy-faced attendant patrols, keeping an eye out for pickpockets, and also answers customers' questions, such as: how the bidding increases today, and if there are any new items. The most experienced simply use their eyesight; these are secondhand dealers whose eyes and minds consult, grander than the ragtag collectors on the street, but they also hold their small drumsticks behind their ears with an air of examination: careful! Occasionally, people in different trades greet each other, revealing solemnity before the battle.</p>
<p>On schedule, the auctioneer walks onto the table—a temporary command post. A smile vanishes, and the entire room falls silent.</p>
<p>The handler checks the catalog and calls out the numbers, while assistants busily hold up the items being called, exaggerating slightly at the corners of their mouths, occasionally turning back to question the busy handler, providing some verification.</p>
<p>Listening to the handler's explanation of the items, hearts in the room begin to race, deciding whether to take aim, bid, increase the price.</p>
<p>Initially, it's some odds and ends, like bottles and jars, ironing implements, kerosene stoves, spittoons... These small items instead stir hesitation among the buyers. The handler bustles about, adding detailed notes, even:</p>
<p>"Medical spittoon, old brand, no blemishes..."</p>
<p>"Foreign porcelain toilet, old Swedish temper—" Unable to resist Chinglish: "Closet Sweden made; made by Sweden."</p>
<p>The audience bursts into laughter.</p>
<p>However, the price also increases, rising from a few cents to two or three dollars.</p>
<p>Upper-class Chinese quietly watch, and foreigners sit comfortably in high places listening attentively. The most excited are the "experts," their eyes more focused than a cat watching a mouse, seizing their target item, watching the price rise and fall.</p>
<p>As space gradually clears in front of the table, the "experts" climb up, holding cigarette butts, using their black hats to support their open chests, sweat on their foreheads condensing some wit and calculation, their gaze shifting from the target item to the rivals, or perhaps rivals, also eyeing the same target. Everyone exchanges malicious smiles, indicating their expertise, with an air of "a fight to the death."</p>
<p>Spraying saliva, they vigorously increase the price, the one with the fuller pockets emerges victorious.</p>
<p>Abuses occur; those slightly more familiar with the process know that if the high price exceeds the true value, the rivalry stirs envy among the customers, and eventually, the one who pays the most is not an expert, but an amateur fool.</p>
<p>Here, too, are old book buyers, harboring great expectations for the whole bundle of foreign books, even though the letters are as unfamiliar to them as if from another world, they are willing to take them over for a closer look when the price is right, not afraid of the joke of looking at the book pages upside down.</p>
<p>Buyers who specifically search for one or two books have to give up because some books are useless to them. The booksellers reveal smug smiles on their faces.</p>
<p>Until the final wooden furniture is called, people calm down. The percentage of those items needed by each person is not large, and those who have gained nothing slip out, leaving some victors to wait for their spoils.</p>
<p>Those who leave have bitter faces, smiling faces, and embarrassing grins—</p>
<h3>Dawn</h3>
<p>— Meiyu</p>
<p>A swiftly falling meteor,</p>
<p>Shatters the walls of darkness.</p>
<p>The whip of darkness,</p>
<p>Draws forth the brilliant sun.</p>
<p>A piercing whistle,</p>
<p>Is the cheer of tens of millions.</p>
<p>Tattered hemp shoes,</p>
<p>Step onto brand new soil.</p>
<h3>The Honored Old Woman (5)</h3>
<p>— Written by Ema Shū, Translated by Ren Jun</p>
<p>The Russo-Japanese War erupted. Yongzao's division immediately mobilized for the front. The old cook woman ran around, showing everyone the letter Yongzao sent when he departed. The gist of the letter was: "From now on, I will be a soldier fighting for the country. Even if I die, I will never die in disgrace. I will not die before I have done my best to defeat the enemies of justice and humanity. Therefore, Mother, please do not grieve and worry too much. Just pray that your son can fight bravely and honorably on the battlefield." It was completely filled with the strong spirit and courage worthy of a soldier. The old woman showed it to everyone, asking them to read it to her again and again. And each time, she sighed deeply several times, as if overcome with emotion; then, with tears in her eyes, she spoke, lavishing the greatest praise on her capable son.</p>
<p>Everywhere, people talked about the war. Old men and children alike discussed nothing but the war. Then, the Japanese army won battle after battle, both at sea and on land. People felt exhilarated and fanatical. They had all become mad militarists. And the towns and villages were filled with cheers of "Banzai!"</p>
<p>The old cook woman was naturally no exception. Wherever she was, if two or three people gathered to talk about the war, she would put down her work and crane her neck to listen. Moreover, she tried desperately to learn about the war's situation and progress. Before long, she had memorized the names of various places in Manchuria, the names of the division commanders, and military terms; and she began to talk about the war herself. However, there were simply too many unfamiliar words, and she often made strange mistakes, which was inevitable. For example, she pronounced Urazhsky as "Ulazhiluosibei," landmine as "landmine-ya," Lushun as "Luoshunkou," and Niuzhuang as "Jiuzhuang"... etc. For her, there was only one place name that she could easily remember after hearing it once, and that was Nanshan. According to her, the pronunciation was the same as the two words "difficult birth."</p>
<p>"What, the Russian devils, fifty thousand, one hundred thousand, what's the big deal. My son alone is enough to deal with them. They probably don't know that the Japanese army has my son Yongzao in it."</p>
<p>She said this with a fierce expression. After saying it, she suddenly laughed out loud.</p>
<p>The attack on Lushun began. The division from our area also participated. Thus, in the peaceful countryside, notices of deaths and injuries in battle began to arrive.</p>
<p>"Today we received a notice of the death of so-and-so from such-and-such street!"</p>
<p>"I heard that so-and-so was seriously injured!"</p>
<p>"Honorable death, honorable injury!"</p>
<h3>Remembering the Past</h3>
<p>— Ouyang Fanha</p>
<p>In the eyes of most intellectuals, the past seems like a beautiful fairyland. If they hear an old woman in the countryside say that each generation is worse than the last, they will certainly think that the old woman is nothing more than a stubborn old person, but they never even dream that, in essence, they are just like the old woman in longing for the beautiful dreams of the past. The reason they consider the past to be so good is actually entirely due to their disappointment with the future and their disgust with the present.</p>
<p>There are originally two types of people who are dissatisfied with the status quo. One type is dissatisfied with the status quo and therefore reminisces about the past, feeling that the more ancient the better, childhood is better than adolescence, adolescence is better than youth, youth is better than middle age; or elementary school is better than middle school, middle school is better than university, university is better than entering society. They are also filled with grief and indignation at the unsatisfactory status quo, as if a Qing dynasty comprador, seeing his son wearing a Western suit, becomes so angry that he pounds his chest and stamps his feet, and thus thinks of the glorious days of hanging a queue behind his head in years past, and cannot help but secretly shed tears. They are hopeless about the future, only feeling that they are heading towards the abyss day by day; Freud once pulled a face to explain that mankind has a spiritual reflection of missing the life in the mother's womb, transforming into a beautiful mountain spring landscape or grassland water color reverting to the dream. This theory, when quoted here, completely loses its solemnity and becomes a mocking of people.</p>
<p>The other type of person who is dissatisfied with the status quo is not like this. They hate the present, but they know that a better future than the present will come. They hold infinite hope for this future, and they develop beautiful longing. Here they find comfort, or they single-mindedly indulge in the realization of this beautiful dream of the future and have no time to even consider the past. However, they are by no means unrecallful of the past, but their method of recollection is completely different. They are never recollecting the past for the sake of admiring the past or reminiscing about the past, thinking that the past is good to linger on and go back to. No, if they recall the past, they must have a purpose consciousness, and this purpose consciousness is very clear and sharply defined, that is, to analyze the past, distinguish between the various different existences of the past, and thereby learn from the past experiences that can be used in the present. This is almost close to scientific research. Apart from this reason, they have no time to go back to the past. They are busy enough pursuing the future to grasp the present.</p>
<p>In the eyes of the former, all the ugly elements of the past are completely excluded, leaving only a mesmerizing, multicolored scene. Using this mesmerizing scene, they treat it as wine for themselves to drink, indulging in it to pass away their increasingly decadent leisure life.</p>
<p>In the eyes of the latter, the ugliness and beauty of the past coexist simultaneously. It is merely a segment of the human process or their own process. When they take a glance at this segment, they must ask how much recognition of the past has been lost in spending the time now to benefit the future? Following the emergence of the bourgeoisie, the classics of Greece and Rome were all recalled and recognized, and this recall was entirely for the sake of the bright and brilliant future of classicism. After the French Revolution, the bourgeoisies of various countries, in their ascendant times, recalled all the reforms after the French Revolution and copied them in the same way, and at that time they were full of a thriving youthful spirit. They never wasted half a moment on these pasts, and after they had finished studying those pasts from all aspects, they returned to their own studios with no feeling at all, as if they were at peace.</p>
<p>But the aristocrats of the French Restoration were different. Looking at the manor that had changed its shape, the peasants who had changed their character, recalling the former Louis era, thinking of the Bourbon dynasty, they spent their remaining lives washing their faces with tears every day. They treated the past as a food, and only the past was the only kingdom where their souls could escape. This situation, reflected in the romantic longing for the Middle Ages, is very similar to that of a severed arm.</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>The Consumption of Superstitious Goods</h3>
<p>— Mengruo</p>
<p>Eliminating superstition in China is still not possible today. First, because superstition is originally an inherited thought, passed down from a distant ancient time, which cannot be changed in a single day. Second, because the power of superstition is deeply rooted in the general public, which also cannot be eradicated in a single day. However, superstition is ultimately a harmful thing, and its existence poses a great obstacle to the development of the nation. Therefore, although superstitious thoughts are not easily eradicated in a single day, it is necessary to find ways to prevent their spread and gradually eliminate them.</p>
<p>Here, I will temporarily set aside the spiritual and behavioral influences of superstition and only look at the economic losses, which are quite alarming. According to the survey conducted by the Fujian Provincial Government, the consumption of superstitious goods in the entire province is more than 5.5 million yuan per year. If the consumption of superstitious goods in one province reaches more than 5.5 million yuan per year, this number is not small. If we add up all the provinces in the country, the national consumption of superstitious goods must be 100 million yuan per year (at least 70 or 80 million yuan). This is an even more enormous figure. In China, where people's livelihoods are declining, most citizens are still struggling to maintain their daily food and clothing. Adding this significant burden every year, their difficult situation can be imagined. This issue deserves attention.</p>
<p>However, the Fujian Provincial Government has no way to reduce this unnecessary loss for the people and is now going to impose a special tax on superstitious goods. Whether this measure is appropriate is worthy of examination. According to reports, Fujian Province has passed a proposal submitted by the Financial Design Committee to impose a special tax on superstitious goods. Based on the consumption of superstitious goods in the province, which is more than 5.5 million yuan per year, a tax of 30% will generate about 1.1 million yuan per year. By implementing this special tax on superstitious goods, the Fujian Provincial Government can increase its tax revenue by 1.1 million yuan per year, which is a huge income. But where will this 1.1 million yuan in taxes come from? Directly from the merchants who manufacture superstitious goods, and indirectly from the people who consume superstitious goods. In this way, the consumption of superstitious goods in Fujian Province, which was originally more than 5.5 million yuan per year, will now increase by 1.1 million yuan, becoming more than 6.6 million yuan. This is a heavier burden for the people.</p>
<p>Or someone might say that since superstition should be eliminated, imposing a special tax on superstitious goods is a method of prohibiting through taxation, which is not necessarily blameworthy. I think this statement is not necessarily correct. Using the method of prohibiting through taxation to eliminate superstition is like using the method of prohibiting through taxation to eradicate opium. This can only make superstition more rampant. If we are truly determined to eliminate superstition, we must change people's thinking through the power of education on the one hand and prohibit the manufacture of superstitious goods so that people have no way to use them on the other hand. If we can do this, even if superstition cannot be eliminated in a single day, it is not impossible to gradually eliminate it.</p>

<h3>A Night at the Inn</h3>
<p>— Yixia</p>
<p>The weather is over ninety degrees, and even the finest twigs on the treetops do not sway slightly. On a rectangular low table, a kerosene lamp is burning. In order to make the flame particularly bright, the glass cover is smoked black by the kerosene fumes, so the room is shrouded in an extra layer of dimness. Several outdated newspapers are spread out on the table. Apart from a few large characters in the headlines, it is difficult to recognize anything else clearly.</p>
<p>It has been half a year since I left my hometown. When I came out, I was wearing a leather coat. Now everything has changed. These days, unexpected changes can happen to you anytime, anywhere. On the journey, I heard news of floods everywhere, from the Yangtze River all the way to the Yellow River, from the Yellow River all the way to the Grand Canal and the Huai River. Everywhere there is news of water, everywhere there are statistics of dead people, everywhere there are advertisements for disaster relief. But you have no way of knowing the accurate news. Everyone is shaking their heads, everyone is sighing. In the city, everyone is busy. Everyone can tell you how terrible the flood is and how tragic the disaster is. It seems that the entire China has already sunk. Although the water has not yet reached my feet, has not yet reached your feet, everyone is panicking, everyone is immersed in the torrent of recession.</p>
<p>However, you have no way of knowing the news you want to know. You can find statistics in the newspaper, you know how high the water is, how much farmland is flooded, how many millions of losses there are. You can also find pictures in illustrated magazines, seeing the crowds of disaster victims. But you still haven't found the news you want to know.</p>
<p>Friends, my hometown has already been buried under the flood, this is what I know, and you also know. However, these days, there are too many changes, too fast. I don't want to know this general news, I want to know more, more specific.</p>
<p>I know my familiar hometown. There is a blue high sky, yellow-white land, winding paths. When I left it, the grass was withering, spread out on the ground, and wheat seedlings were spreading at the foot of the mountains, it was a beautiful, magnificent mountain village.</p>
<p>Now it is early autumn, it should be when the green grass decorates the entire hometown. The leaves of the white poplars are shining, twinkling on the hillside, the persimmons are red, and the jujubes are ripe. Especially the Guandi Temple in the poplar forest at the foot of the mountain. Those are all familiar to us.</p>
<p>I know the stockaded village, I know the earthen walls of the stockaded village, I know the oily green grass that regrows on the earthen walls every year. I also know the seeds that this grass bears every year in early autumn; those are lovely little things, bright red.</p>
<p>The leaves of the white poplar trees are about to turn yellow-red with the arrival of autumn. The red walls of the Guandi Temple, the red seeds of the grass, the red leaves of the white poplars, are the autumn that children are intoxicated with. Especially the harvest time, it is the time of rural songs all over the fields.</p>
<p>There is also our home, the people in our home, and the neighbors.</p>
<p>But now it has changed, everything has changed quickly.</p>
<p>We know that water is flooding everywhere, from the Yangtze River to the Yellow River. Everyone is panicking, everyone is shaking their heads and sighing. In the city, everyone is busy. Busy with disaster relief, sighing that there are too many changes these days, panicking about this recessionary torrent.</p>
<p>It is already early autumn, and the weather is so hot. The glass cover of the kerosene lamp is even dimmer. The newspaper brought from the city three days ago, although it is old, is still the only fresh news.</p>
<p>Under the dim light of the kerosene lamp, recognizing each word one by one, regardless of the sweat all over my body, regardless of the greedy mosquitoes, turning the newspaper over and over again.</p>
<p>How is my hometown? The leaves of the white poplars, the walls of the Guandi Temple, and the seeds of the grass. And the home, our home, family members, and neighbors.</p>
<p>The newspaper says this… it says fields, houses, disaster victims, and various statistics of losses.</p>
<h3>Jiupanzi (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Youqi</p>
<p>This dropped a huge bomb among us. We understood why he hadn't spoken and why the coolies were silent.</p>
<p>—What to do? This became our collective demand. "Biting the bit and running fast" was certainly a good method, but what if it didn't work out? So, we were at a loss.</p>
<p>I don't know why, but suddenly I thought of the outlaw heroes in old novels. The appearance of them appearing on stage reminded me of burly figures with angry eyes, thick eyebrows, thin-soled boots, and reminded me of a loud shout stopping the way, steel knives rising and heads in different places, and even reminded me of roars like thunder shaking the mountains... I tried my best to bring up all the appearances I could imagine in my brain. Why did I want to think like this? I don't know, I just felt that it had to be like this.</p>
<p>It is said that when a person's mood is uneasy, their nervous senses are very sharp. This was tested today. A burst of horse bells rolled in from the other side of the mountain, and my heart would shake. The leaves on the trees made a few more noises, and even passers-by looked at us more, which could arouse our animosity, making us think of another situation.</p>
<p>The Dasha Ditch passed unconsciously, and Jiupanzi stood tightly in front of us—</p>
<p>Squeezing my heart, cold sweat broke out on my head. I quietly lightened my pace as I walked. Old Huang and Old Wei held the weapons they had brought tightly in their hands, looking at the sky. The sun was covered by dark clouds, and the time was approaching six o'clock.</p>
<p>The sky seemed to be deliberately opposing us. At the critical moment, it was terrifyingly dark. There were some things wriggling in the distance, which could not be guessed or seen clearly.</p>
<p>Stepping onto the top of Jiupanzi Mountain, I don't know why, but the coolies in front, led by the coolie leader, shouted their jargon, like a long snake, on the sheep intestine mountain road hidden by trees, which had a special flavor.</p>
<p>What is the reason? Don't worry about it. We know Lao Zhang's wit. Good, let's sing loudly too!</p>
<p>So, we sang out-of-tune mountain songs, stretching our throats, and the lingering sound lingered in the mountains.</p>
<p>Passing through a sloping hillside and reaching the top of the mountain, we looked around. The mountains joined hands and formed a circle, and in the middle became a large deep valley. No matter which side you came up from, you would never realize what was going on in the deep valley until you reached the top. Call for help? Don't even think about it. In fact, there is no way to find your trace at all. Unless you are foolish, you will never achieve that unfortunate result.</p>
<p>The sky was strangely dim. It looked like it would rain tonight. People waiting in the mountains were not surprised by this. In the place where miasma condenses, the weather is unreliable. The stream and the whistling wind, although they can increase the natural interest, we have no time to appreciate them.</p>
<p>——Ah? How lucky we should be! After going down the mountain, I took a deep breath.</p>
<p>The time pointed to six o'clock. Coolie leader Zhang ran over from the front with a flushed face and said——</p>
<p>——Oops, it's too late. We can't make it to the distant place. We have to rest at Guanyin Bridge today.</p>
<p>——Walk faster! Hey, stay at Guanyin Bridge!</p>
<p>It is easy to go down the mountain but difficult to climb up. In this way, we fell into the station before the lights were lit. From the rumors of the people in the station, we knew that this place was a dangerous place. We knew that single travelers often had to sacrifice themselves, and we also knew that before two or three o'clock, some people had suffered unfortunate encounters here.</p>
<p>——Don't go to look around in the nearby places! Be more careful at night! Lao Zhang repeatedly told us.</p>
<p>When we had dinner, there were still many people who came to watch. They still had towels wrapped around their heads, but in our eyes, we always felt that they were harboring evil intentions and were full of killing.</p>
<p>It was night, and everything around was silent. Listening to the whistling wind and the chirping insects, our hearts were surrounded by unstable air, uneasy.</p>
<p>——When will it be dawn? These are hard times!</p>

<p>Lao Yan Yearning</p>
<p>Clouds gather in the clear sky, ice dew surges, wind sweeps away the remaining red, fragrant steps are in disarray, countless kinds of parting hate and leisure sorrow, spring warm and autumn cool, the year ends again. This day last year, in this door, begonias are red, but how can an empty stomach cook a dragon and make phoenix meat? Lao Yan fly separately, each to the west and east! Human beauty, deeply locked in embroidered curtains; heart desolate, jade steps fear to move. Thinking of Chang'e rising in the east and setting in the west, who shares the grievance with Heaven? Pei Hang does not dream of traveling immortals, mandarin ducks lose their mates, fish and water are difficult to be the same. (Spoken) You are the lover in the shadow, I am the beloved in the painting, the heart is empty, dreams meet, tears sprinkle on the strings, feelings rise from the bottom of the heart, the confidante's heart is naturally satisfied, and the nostalgic person's intestines are broken and painful!</p>

The autumn clouds change mysteriously and skillfully. The autumn breeze caresses the face with high spirits. Looking back at the Milky Way filling the magpie bridge. A smiling yet tearful fairy.

<h3>"Broken Dreams of Spring" Released</h3>
<p>Ge Xiaotai Jiabao's work of this year, the Russian literary giant Tolstoy's immortal tragic love tragedy, the world-famous "Anna Karenina," translated as "Broken Dreams of Spring," is scheduled to be screened at the Nanjing Grand Theater starting today. "Broken Dreams of Spring" is not only MGM's grand work celebrating Jiabao's tenth anniversary on the screen, but also the film that won the first prize in this year's 3rd International Film Competition held in Italy, and it also allows our unique Jiabao, who has enjoyed a ten-year reputation, to be proud of herself. The cast includes "Resurrection" Delimaqu, "The Miser" Italian Lei Di Bassolo Mi, and Marlene O'Sullivan, which is enough to know the strength of the film, let alone Jiabao fans who are using countless words to promote it.</p>
<h3>Silver Miscellaneous Notes</h3>
<p>— Zhier</p>
<p>The three-day date for the film industry's charity fair has passed. I don't know how much relief money there is besides the expenses for "food" and "refreshments"? How many disaster victims have benefited from the film industry's fair charity?</p>
<p>It is said that the third day of the fair was the "most prosperous" day, but when I left Dahu Garden, I saw the ground was full of yellow discount tickets. I don't know how many disaster victims can actually benefit?</p>
<p>It is already a joke to issue discount tickets for a charity fair, and it is even more of a joke to issue so many discount tickets?</p>
<p>Has everyone forgotten that this is a charity fair?</p>
<p>Yan Ciping, Li Shifang, and other photographers who make a living by "taking photos of female stars" are taking photos of the stars backstage, and people outside are shouting, "Take more sensual photos!" "Hey, take photos with a shirt on!" "Hey! Hey! Hey! Pull down the shoulder straps of the shirt!" and more.</p>
<p>On this day, there were many "exciting scenes." People in the film industry mostly came in pairs, and Yuan Meiyun and Chen Jiazhen even met on a narrow road in the pavilion of the Kaoerfu golf course.</p>
<p>It is not Chen Jiazhen's "self-promotion." It is said that there are many fruits and candies from all walks of life "comforting" Chen in his drawer.</p>
<h3>"Triumphant Song" and "Literacy Campaign"</h3>
<p>— Baimu</p>
<p>Since the government promulgated the "Literacy Campaign," the call to eliminate illiteracy has filled the country. Educational institutions and people with lofty ideals in various places have organized or established literacy schools and are engaged in the "Literacy Campaign" work under the guidance of the government, hoping to achieve the goal of eliminating illiteracy.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter passed by Jin Situ Temple and heard the sound of "small dog, small cat" reading aloud coming from the arts. Curiosity prompted me to go inside to watch. I saw a school building in the photography studio, with a sign that said "Peasant Children's Elementary School" hanging horizontally at the school gate.</p>
<p>At that time, in my mind, I suddenly thought of the current vigorous "Literacy Campaign." I thought that Yihua Company had also started a literacy school, but when I went inside, I found that they were filming. It is said that this is a scene from "Triumphant Song" directed by Mr. Bu Wancang. I discovered Wei Heling, who played the teacher, and found Wang Yin among many adult and child peasant students. Wang Yin was asking Wei Heling questions about the drought. The two had a heated debate due to the conflict between science (water vapor) and superstition (Dragon King Temple). In the end, Wang Yin was convinced by Wei Heling's well-founded scientific common sense. Because the air was handled properly, I felt very excited. I thought that when "Triumphant Song" is released, it would be of great help to the rural literacy movement, right?</p>
<h3>Publishing World</h3>
<p>Since the dispute with Shao Gong, Chen Jiazhen has been deeply stimulated and has been ill for many days. He once said to people: "Yesterday's things are like yesterday's death." From now on, he should devote himself to art. Therefore, he has decided to bury himself in hard work and concentrate on the Yisheng, which he edits, which is also the ancient people's intention to relieve sorrow with wine. The fourth issue will be published tomorrow. The content includes more than ten recent special photos of Chen, artist sketches, Hu Die's personally written open letter in response, Chen Jiazhen's long creative work "Circle," which is wonderfully indescribable, four tough guys from Hollywood, four guests from Dentsu, all kinds of autumn poses, Yanyan's five-minute talk, etc., which are richer than the previous three issues and make people reluctant to put them down. Each copy costs two cents.</p>

<p>Shen Bao Local Supplement - Automobile Weekly</p>
<h3>Discussing the Special Features of Three-Wheeled Automobiles</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Ever since the automobile came into being, in the minds of most people, it has been assumed that if an automobile is to be built, then the four wheels on the car are a matter of course. They cannot be increased, nor can they be decreased. However, this kind of thinking is not necessarily the case in the eyes of another group of uniquely ingenious people. They feel that the existing 5,000,000 automobile users are somewhat too traditional in their thinking. Therefore, in recent years, after painstaking research, they have discovered that three wheels are best for an automobile. Not only is this their ideal, but there are also several automobile manufacturing engineers who specialize in designing three-wheeled automobiles. Regardless of whether these three-wheeled automobiles can become popular on the market, they always feel that this kind of automobile has its own indelible advantages.</p>
<p>The attention paid to three-wheeled automobiles is still a fact of a very short period of time. Therefore, the number of these vehicles can be said to be extremely small. According to current investigations, there are about ten or more different styles that have been discovered in Europe. As for China, it can be said that there are no such three-wheeled automobiles yet. All there are are three-wheeled motorized bicycles. These motorized bicycles are mostly used for transporting light items.</p>
<p>Among the few three-wheeled passenger cars in the United States, there is recently a type of Bucksminster Fuller's "Dymaxion." It can be said to include all the advantages of three-wheeled automobiles. The most noteworthy are: (1) Excellent streamline. (2) Ease of operation. (3) Reduced weight. This car is a large automobile, and the car compartment is very spacious, but its weight is only 3,000 pounds. It is powered by a Ford engine and can travel 100 miles per hour. It can park on the side of the road with only a gap as long as its body. The driver can start the front wheel and turn its rear wheel. If parked in a tight and narrow space, the driver can first drive the front end of the car in, turn the rear wheel to an 80-degree angle, and then start the engine to turn the rear end of the car in. The two spacious passenger seats are located in front of the engine. Speaking of the arrangement of its wheels, it is like a three-wheeled bicycle traveling backward, and its operation is similar to that of a three-wheeled bicycle. Some people say that the convenience of this car is something they have never seen before.</p>
<p>Why is people's interest in three-wheeled automobiles gradually increasing and rising? It may be helpful to briefly explain the reasons here. If we go back to the past, the roads were still paved entirely with dirt. When the car drove on the ground, it left two ruts. Therefore, the wheels of the car had to be manufactured according to the ruts. The gauge of the horse-drawn vehicles in the northern United States was about 56.5 inches, and in the southern United States, it was 60 inches. Therefore, early automobiles had to be fitted with a size between the two, depending on the needs of the buyer. Although there are still some dirt roads left now, most of the roads have been converted to hard surfaces. Whether the wheels of the car can match the ruts is certainly not a problem.</p>
<p>Another advantage of three-wheeled automobiles is streamlining. The term "streamline" has now been overused by everyone. Strictly speaking, the so-called streamline of general automobiles today only achieves its likeness in form and some superficial aspects. However, some people still believe that even if an automobile is made to be truly streamlined, its benefits are not entirely certain. Now let's talk about the shape of a quasi-streamlined type. If we dissect a typical fish into two halves, then the upper half becomes a streamlined shape. The widest beam is near the front, and the tail end is tapered. There should be no protrusions in the appearance to ensure its smoothness. The wheels must be wrapped up. Headlights, mudguards, etc., must also be integrated into the same form as the car body. If this shape conforms to the streamlined type, then this automobile must be three-wheeled. Because there is no room for two wheels at the tail. The reduction of wind noise, fuel economy, and the increase in acceleration are all special features of streamlined cars. As for the increase in speed, it goes without saying.</p>
<p>Speaking of the appearance of the car body, most people think that the three-wheeled car is more beautiful than the four-wheeled car. There is even a group of people who say that apart from three-wheeled cars, no automobile can match its beautified posture. Regarding the issue of weight reduction, everyone has their own opinion. Some people say that the weight required for a three-wheeled automobile is less than half of that of a common automobile. Whether this figure is accurate or not is not stated here for the time being. Just based on ordinary knowledge, the weight of a three-wheeled automobile is not more than three-quarters of that of a four-wheeled car. The car body of a three-wheeled car can be manufactured using a conical metal sheet. This metal sheet is light and strong, similar to the skeleton of a single-wing airplane. Therefore, the weight of a three-wheeled automobile is certainly not excessively heavy.</p>
<p>The manufacturing cost of three-wheeled automobiles is said to be greatly reduced compared to ordinary automobiles. Not only because of its light weight, but also because the body configuration is simple, the cost is also greatly reduced. Various inlays, etc., can be manufactured on inexpensive turning machines, unlike the currently popular automobiles, which must be manufactured on die-casting heavy pressure and other machines, which are very expensive. Regarding important manufacturing issues such as engine style, position, weight distribution, and power management, it is not possible to solve them all at once. However, those engineers who are researching the manufacture of three-wheeled automobiles believe that the center of gravity, if it is a car with a wheelbase of 125 inches, must be between 20 to 30 inches behind the front axle, then the safety of a three-wheeled automobile during driving can be increased compared to a four-wheeled car. Because the steering of this car only uses one wheel, all the common front-end problems can be eliminated. The position of the engine can be changed according to different weight distributions. The allocation of seats also depends on the engine position.</p>
<p>The picture on the right shows a strong Ford truck traveling in the desert near Gansu. In the hinterland of northwestern China, where deserts are intertwined, mountains rise and fall, or rivers freeze, the Ford truck has many amazing records in transportation under such circumstances.</p>
<h3>History of the Development of Diesel Engines for Automobiles (1)</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yisheng</p>
<p>The reason why the original diesel engine is so eager to be popularized in Europe and the United States is fourfold: (1) Diesel engines can burn heavy oil, which is cheaper. The ratio of heavy oil to ordinary gasoline is almost one to three. (2) It is not equipped with a carburetor and is not affected by cold weather and freezing. (3) Cumbersome and heavy spark plugs, storage batteries, and motors are eliminated. (4) Heavy oil is not as easy to burn as light gasoline. It adds a lot of security in terms of safety.</p>
<p>Just a few months ago, a Cummins six-cylinder diesel sports car started from New York, crossed the new continent to Old Saint in California. The journey was three thousand seven hundred and seventy-four miles. However, the heavy oil consumed by the Qin was worth only 7.63 U.S. dollars, equivalent to about 16 silver dollars in our country. It burns only about four cents worth of heavy oil per 100 miles of travel. This can be described as a new record for oil use in the automobile industry.</p>
<p>The world's machine engineers have long held great hope for the effectiveness of diesel engines more than ten years ago. The reason for the delay in development until today is that coal production was high and prices were low at that time, and water engines were easy to manufacture. There was no need for much change and saving. Today, however, commercial warfare is becoming more and more fierce, especially under the cloud of recession. It is necessary to strive for economy in consumption. So, the diesel engine is still there. Today, everything from streamlined trains, automobiles, postal ships, and airplanes is being improved and competing to install diesel engines. Other facilities such as hydroelectric power plants, tillers, and power for the entire factory are gradually adopting diesel engines. At present, my country's machine factories can also imitate and manufacture them for small industries such as water pumping, rice milling, and cotton ginning. However, due to the low metallurgy, the crude machine furniture, and the disregard of arithmetic, my country's products have not been able to compete with imported products for a day. Not to mention the engines used for automobiles and airplanes.</p>
<p>Last year, in the United States alone, the total horsepower of diesel engines manufactured by various machine factories was as high as 750,000 horsepower. It is estimated that it can be doubled this year. All factories that used to manufacture gasoline engines are now opening special departments to study the manufacture of diesel engines. In the past twelve months, various improvements have made rapid progress, creating a new record in the world's power industry.</p>
<p>The reason why diesel engines are more economical than other types of engines is due to their great efficiency. For example, a few months ago, a large European machine factory built a large engine with 5,500 horsepower. The test results showed that its efficiency was 41% (that is to say, for example, if 100 pounds of heavy oil is added, only 41 pounds is actually effective). This is much higher than 21% for water turbines, 10% for gasoline engines, and 6% for train water engines.</p>
<p>Since diesel currency has so many advantages, why not popularize it earlier? The reasons have been briefly described in the previous paragraph. Now I will extend the discussion from the various problems in manufacturing and operation.</p>
<h3>Ford Driving Comfort in Hot Weather</h3>
<p>The refinement of the new Ford V-8 car makes summer driving exceptionally comfortable. The reason for this is that the Ford car's ventilation system is a major factor. In addition, there are individually controlled adjustable screens, wide-diaphragm cowl ventilators, and window ventilation equipment. When the weather is scorching, the windows, screens, and cowl ventilators can all be opened to allow a large amount of air to enter the car. In ordinary weather, the cowl ventilator can be opened first. If the weather turns cold at night, or there is a drizzle, the cowl ventilator can be closed, and the window ventilation gap can be opened to allow the stale air in the car to slowly escape through this gap, and then fresh air can be let in without the intrusion of drafts.</p>
<p>There is also a new "deflector" type engine ventilation setting, which can improve the cold operation of the engine even in the most difficult summer conditions. All the airflow from the engine fan face is sucked into the holes, goes down through a conduit into the crankcase, then flows upward into the valve chamber, and then exits through the vent holes, along with the water quality and other steam, so that the engine oil can be cooled and prevented from deteriorating during high-speed summer operation.</p>
<p>The design of the V-8 engine ensures that each row of four cylinders has a separate set of water jackets. This ensures rapid and accurate water flow. Each cylinder is completely surrounded by a water jacket, extending its entire length. Therefore, even under severe operating conditions, "hot spots" and cylinder distortion can be prevented.</p>
<p>In order to protect the car from the effects of heat, the new car model is equipped with external ribs to increase its heat radiation area and strength. In this way, even frequent braking can avoid the "weakening" of the car brakes, because frequent stopping can cause the brake drums to expand, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the car brakes.</p>
<p>Car drivers pay attention to using as little force as possible when driving. In this regard, the 1935 Ford V-8 is a real help because its transmission box operates more softly and efficiently. This new transmission basin utilizes centrifugal force to make meshing more definite, and greatly reduces the pedal pressure required when disengaging. If you want the paint of your car to shine brightly in the summer, it is very important to clean it often. However, Ford cars are easier to satisfy this wish because they use a new type of baked enamel finish. This finish does not change even under the strong light of the summer sun. It can be as bright as new with just a rinse.</p>

<p>Tannan District: Baise 50, Tianbao 234, Pingzhi 67, totaling 351 li.</p>
<p>New trunk lines: 6443 li. County roads: 5898 li. Total: 12341 li.</p>
<p>As for the toll collection methods for each road, large passenger vehicles are charged 2.2 jiao of silver per 10 li, small cars are charged 2.6 jiao, and freight transport of general merchandise is charged 1.2 jiao of silver per 100 jin per 10 li, while agricultural products are halved. This regulation is somewhat expensive, but because gasoline is imported from overseas and the price is high, current fares cannot be reduced. The Road Bureau has recently used kerosene oil residue and alcohol charcoal gas to replace gasoline, and the test results are good. However, kerosene oil residue is still imported. In order to avoid the outflow of money, special attention is paid to burning charcoal. After future promotion, the fares can be greatly reduced. In addition, automobiles are only used on provincial and county roads, and cannot travel on village roads. Agricultural transportation is still difficult to popularize. The Road Bureau has been modifying various ox carts, horse carts, and rickshaws in recent months in order to pass through village roads, so that provincial, county, and village roads are connected to each other to facilitate the transportation in rural areas and promote the sale of production.</p>
