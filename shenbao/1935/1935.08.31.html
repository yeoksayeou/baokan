<h3>開展中之華北新局勢</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>行政院汪院長復職伊始。卽决議任宋哲元爲平津衛戍司令。隔昨國府復明令撤消平政整會。由院令王克敏趕辦結束。二者雖各有其意義。要爲出於同一基調。吾人於此。不難推知政府外交策略。已有一種具體决定而。以二事爲其旣定方針之表面化。今後華北新局面之展開。殆爲常人意計中事。而其動向如何。又吾人所急欲拭目而覘者也。</p>
<p>一年來之華北局勢。張弛不定。警訊頻傳。當局旣感應付之匪易。國事愈增杌隉之隱憂。自河北事件發生。情形乃突趨惡化。一時華北復處戰雲籠罩之下。而幾不免於决裂。我方當局始終以容忍之態度。謀適應之處置。使事態不致擴大。空氣復歸平靜。然在不諒之人。猶復屢施責難。迨此次注院長以病辭職。而謠諑復甚囂塵上。非特國際問有種種離奇之風說。卽在邦人士亦難免疑慮之叢生。幸中央一致决議。挽汪復職。而蔣汪復於事前數度會晤。取得協調。故汪一復任。卽毅然施行預定之策劃。一變夙昔舉棋莫定之態度。藉以栘轉國人之視聽。以察事去職之宋哲元。而令重綰平津軍符。其在事實上必先獲有相當之諒解可知。以總攬華北政務之政整會。一旦遽予撤消。其爲預策未來大局之穩定亦可知。吾人默揣華北局勢。殆已入於好轉途　。至少在最近之將來。當不致再惹意外之糾紛矣。</p>
<p>吾人之爲此言。非敢慶幸一時之苟安。便忘邦家整個之福利。誠以時至今日。內外交迫。災饉薦臻。正如百孔千瘡。補苴無從着手。以國人遭受剝蝕之深。實不堪再罹蕩析之禍。明知偸安非計。亦欲稍蘇喘息。在政府一經確立步驟。舉措可免遲迴。此於進行原則上亦差堪吿慰者也。抑吾人猶有不能已於言者。將來之華北。軍事上之威脅雖可暫免。經濟上之提携要成問題。所謂興中公司之組織。是否尙有其他之涵義。而開發產業云者。能否合乎平等之原則。均宜由雙方當局從長交換意見。妥籌對策。至如平方所進行之華北經濟委會津紳籌組中之東亞經濟協會。其立塲如何。背景若何。尤應予以確切之調　。嚴密之注視。不能以其爲局部行　而等閒置之也。</p>

<p>貨物收據貨物收據、按照舊印花稅辦法、原屬不必貼花、而新法則規定、為貨價滿三元以上者貼一分、滿十元以上者貼一分、滿百元以上者貼三分、貼至三分為止、不再加貼、各商店廠家平日所用這信件回單、是爲送信收據、依法母須貼花、但有時於信外註明送上貨物幾件、則此項回單、應卽貼花、故除純粹之送信回單外、應以貼花為妥、至在九月一日以前所用之送貨回單、自九月一日起、卽應依法貼花、不能以立簿在九月一日以前爲對抗、但舊賑簿之已貼印花一角者、可用至總結賬時為止、現時不必加貼，惟九月一日以後開立之新賬簿、則應貼二角、又稅率表銀錢貨物收據下之說明、有「但金融業存欵收據除外」句、此句之意義為金融業存欵收據貼花辦法、另有第四項第九項等規定、非謂金融業存欵收據不必貼花也、</p>
<p>人民呈廣　人民投遞官暑之呈文由請書、按照舊條例第二條第三類規定、應貼印花一角、但新印花稅法無此規定、應可免貼、又請求入國籍禀書、新法亦免貼印花、</p>
<p>催賬結單催賬結單、按照印花稅暫行條例、本無貼花規定、但後來以部令規定貼花、至新法則訂明免貼、惟催賬單之解釋、有施行細則第五條規定、係指年節所用、僅列結欠數目之催賬單而言、其習慣上按月或按年節開列品名數量價値交給顧客、憑以付欵之賬單、如成衣店之賬單等、仍應依法貼花、不得認為催索欠欵之賬單、</p>
<p>甘結切結甘結切結、在舊條例列為第三類四十五種之一種、新法則並無專項、而包含於稅率表第二十七項保單內、所謂對於某人或某種物品或某種事項擔保其行為品質或前途之妥善、或保其不發生某種事實所立之單據也、稅率仍為每件貼印花一角、</p>
<p>當票貼花舊條例規定、「當額在四元以上之當票」應貼花、新法則當票卽包含於第九項借貸或抵押單據內、所謂以貨物抵押向人借貸銀錢也、每件金額未滿十元者免貼、此項解釋、財政部批江蘇全省典業同業公會聯合會（稅字第五二一八號）曾有明確之指示、原文載商業月報第八期本人所輯之工商法令解釋彙編中、惟當票以前規定、均貼一分、現時則加為在十元以上者至少貼二分、一百零一元之當票、卽須貼四分、又掛失保單、每件貼一角、卽當本僅五角之掛失保單，亦應貼一角、而當本一千元之掛失保單、亦僅貼一角</p>
<p>銀錢支票銀行錢莊所用支票、及性質與此相類似之票據依照舊條例規定、係累進貼花自應貼印花一分起、至一元五角止、但經銀行錢業公會請求結果、由財政部令准緩貼、此次新法實施、以前財政部核准免貼緩貼或减貼印花之各成案、一律廢止、支票卽應按照稅率表第四項規定、不論數目多寡、每件貼印花二分、雖經上海銀行公會一再呈請緩貼、惟新稅法係經立法院通過、國民政府公布之正式法令、非暫行條例可比、不能以行政命令變更、卽有修改、應經立法手續、故在立法院未正式修正以前、九月一日以後乏支票、均行依法每張貼印花兩分、以上數項、為新舊稅法遞嬗時最為普遍應注意之點、其詳細比較、詳載於市商會出版之商業月報第八期印花稅法專號中、惟該號初版五千册、已經售罄、刻正將關於印花稅部分提出另印特刊、約九月四日可以出版、每冊售價一角五分、外埠加郵費三分、</p>

<h3>南華公司　華戊輸在日本觸礁　船身船員均有保險</h3>
<p>南華公司華戊輪、本為歐戰時由我海軍部沒收之奧國輪、後經南華公司購買、仍沿用華戊名稱、該輸船身甚巨、載量有四千二百四十九噸、經理為趙甫臣·船主為挪威人强納遜·近來該輪出租與人、運裝煤炭礦砂、往來中國日本一路、</p>
<p>赴日卸貨</p>
<p>上次在馬鞍島、滿裝鐵砂、駛至橫濱交卸、當離浦口往日時、曾撞壞拖駁碼頭、及至吳淞、又失落一錨、迨經配齊開到日本、將船貨卸淸、準備開回、該船大副、曾致電問趙甫臣、報吿船主有微恙、並請示辦法、趙郎復電、速還上海、擬派到秦皇島運煤赴日、</p>
<p>遇風觸礁</p>
<p>該輸從橫濱起椗、開還上海、二十九日上午三時許駛到將抵神戶之三重縣、渡會郡·宿田·蘇村·海邊五十米達處、適遇颶風襲吹、該處暗礁叢生、航行至艱、該輪卽在此處觸礁、船體擱在礁石上、暴風大雨、襲打至烈、情勢非常險惡、無綫電等、盡行打毀、故不能向上海吿急、</p>
<p>船員救出</p>
<p>該輪船員、以時當深夜、毫無救援、延至天明、始由該地日本居民發見、始組織救護隊、放船到華戊觸礁處、將船內一部分船員水手人等救起上陸、究竟救起若干人、滬公司尙未得到詳細電報、昨已電日查詢矣、</p>
<p>來電證實</p>
<p>記者於昨日上午、分赴各方面探查華戊輪失事眞相、雖已知其遭遇不幸、顧南華公司迄無正式電訊接到、仍不能有切實消息、直至下午五時、該公司方始接得日商大同株式會社轉到由神戶發來電報、言華戊輪確已在上述地點遇風觸礁、情勢十分險惡、</p>
<p>祇可拆卸</p>
<p>該電係於昨日上午九時發出、午後方到上海、來　係用英文、僅寥寥數語、略述華戊輪觸礁甚重、船身已陷入礁石內、殊無營救脫險之望、祇可將此船船身拆卸矣云云、南華得此眾訊、立卽轉報中國船舶保險聯合會、一面設法調查該輪損失狀况、</p>
<p>電告領事</p>
<p>趙甫臣根據此電、先用公司名義、發電到日本神戶、致我國頭事館內、請神戶領館、代為派員至華戊輪遇難地點、切實查勘該輪損失狀况、以憑進行營救等事、再救起船員若干、有無被難船員、亦懇頒館代為查明、並乞設法將救起各船員、遣送回滬、</p>
<p>保險問題</p>
<p>華戊輪船壳、向本埠中國船舶保險聯合會、共保平安險洋十二萬元、又船上全部船員、更向本埠海上意外保險公司投保意外險洋三萬數千元、故此次卽使全船毀損、船員被難、均有賠欵可得、南華公司可無絲毫損失、船員意外險之效用、至此方見大有效力也、</p>

<p>另外一件有益的事，却不知怎的像被好風無端吹送了前來。童子中有幾人是「做生意一的—這是他們的說法—因爲多數來自貧窮的人家，裴氏夫婦知道他們不久要自食其力，便獎勵欲求自立的種種努力。韜摩賣他的雞蛋；解客在牲口事業上做投機，拂朗帮助敎課，却也得到一點束脩；內達愛做木工，因此爲他設了一個車床，他用了這個做出許多有用而美麗的物事，將其出售；小橋建造了小輪「揮尾孑孓，」（一種陀螺，）以及儘是沒用却又奧妙各種各式無可名狀的機器，這些他也脫手換給其餘的童子們了。</p>
<p>「讓他做一個機器匠，假如他喜歡的話，裴先生說道。「給每個童子以　種行業，那末他可以自立。工作是有益身心的，所以不管這些童子們所具有的材能是什麼，—不管他的是詩歌或是耕種—都得加以培植，如果可能的話，幷要使其成爲有用之村」。</p>

<p>裴先生立即回答道；</p>
<p>「去罷，我幷日喜歡所見這個消息。這是　樁愉快，於你也是椿容易的工作，我聽到他們給你這個機會是很快樂的」。</p>

<h3>紗花　紗花自行交割者多</h3>
<p>紗昨日爲八月期標紗舉行交　、循例停市、查八月期標紗與三月一日上塲、價爲一百八十四元二角、旋以金副風波、起伏不已、商塲週轉、遭蒙不利、外商利用時機、逐日拋賣、紗市遂一蹶不振、八月期最低峯至一百六十一元、較上塲價步跌二十三元一角、幸不久現紗銷路忽轉活動、廠家受紗價頻跌之打擊、停業日多、减工更為普遍現象、產量大减、多方乘機拉提、同時市上通貨膨脹謠傳極盛、尤有助長多方活動之力量、久疲之紗市、遂起激烈之反動、由七月直二日之最低一百六十一元步漲至三十九日之一百七十八元八角、十七日間猛漲十七元八角、市氣沸騰、但通貨謠傳未能證實、現銷由旺轉淸、一度興奮之紗市、遂又陷入疲途、八月底多方大戶俄然放棄收貨、掃數了結、市盤益靴支持、卒以一百六十五元六角收盤較上塲價低十八元六角、較七月收盤價低七元四角、殘餘待交割者計一千六百包、均爲自行交割、交割價最後三日扯算爲一百六十七元、較七月份低二元、</p>
<p>花查八月期標棉、於三月一日之三十五元七角五分上塲、旋即穿出六元關外、但以金融枯竭、及紗市傾跌之影響、漸陷疲境、廠方停工减產日見深刻、現棉銷路、益感淸淡、跌風遂不可抑止、六月十八日曾見三十元〇三角五分之最低峯、但多頭方面、鑒於陳棉存底雖多、大都在銀行之手、以虧蝕之故、均嚴守不放、市塲中解有大宗現棉、可供流動、遂乘機在近期猛力軋空、遠期因水災影響、亦隨漲甚速、同時又或傳通膨脹、一時人氣鼎沸、棉市反動激漲、最高峯見三十六元九角、紗市在八月中雖以謠言不實、再入疲途、而近期棉市、因多頭努力拉進之故、始終堅俏、不幸最後三日、因美政府忽發表本年美棉貸欵爲每　九分、較去年度减少三分、世界棉市、均報猛跌、多方方拉不易、　帶小八九角、以三十六元收盤、較上塲價高一角五分、較最高價僅低九角、較七月份則高五角、殘齡待交割者計二萬七千一百担、實行交割者僅千六百担、餘均自行交割、交割價爲三十五元五角、交收兩方實行交割數量如下、</p>

<h3>美棉農尚在躊躇中</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、各月漲跌一二磅音、交易淸淡、棉農究將拋賣或接受借欵、將待政府訓吿、故暫時觀望、但有一般人以爲農民將迅速售出其新花至一角、雖有一角之貸欵、然價格殊有跌進一角大關之可能、目貸欵計劃非常複雜、故實施時極易延時與混亂、同業爲塲中大買戶、其後因套賣增加、紐奧崙賣出十月、奧克拉霍媽有雨、市價步虛、現銷呆滯、棉織品市况堅定活動、據報有大量交易可成、收盤平疲、計現貨跌十五磅音、期貨跌至十五碎音、英棉現貨漲點、期貨跌四至六點、印棉因投機家及套頭買進而堅、計平果爾漲二羅比、奧姆辣漲一·七五羅比、白羅溪漲一·五羅比、原電錄左、（二十九日電）</p>
<p>又據孟貿電、三十日白羅溪花之開盤預測、爲一百九十二比、較上日收盤跌一·五羅比、</p>
<h3>糧食　本月粉多頭脫手</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上下午開盤、各月份呈近跌遠平之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥微小四八分、坎拿大小二三角不等、市塲人心、頗不穩定、本月份因屬終了之日仍現軋多之態、以實銷不暢、客戶無意收貨、並有一部分廠家之貨、確有交割之意、是以多頭惶恐、開價即祇三角五分半、直小至四分半、後以補空、復回至六分外、迨至下午、初尙平定、後因多頭被迪脫手、又步步軟弱、故結局仍小至五分左右、至遠期交易不旺、價稍低落、結果本月份跌二分二厘半、九月份跌一分、十月份跌二厘半、十一月份至一月份各小半分、</p>
<h3>中次小麥續見脩削</h3>
<p>昨期麥市面、上下午開盤、各月份市面、平寂異常、因本月份已經終拍、交易無多、良以遠期各月份、雖洋麥報價、仍趨小面、惟市塲之拋售者、非有實貨、亦不敢放膽拋空、至多頭測業中人一致觀望、尤無生氣、是以冷寂之態、愈益不佳、結果九月份較小一分、十月份小三分、現來市面、亦趨平定、特高貨尙能站立、中次貨則廠胃不貪、又小一二分、觀察後步、尙續軟之勢、開山東　三元六角半、瑤灣麥三元六角三分、張八嶺滁州麥三元六角二分、高郵麥三元五角六分、由福　辦三千包、</p>
<h3>杜粳平定洋客秈銷路尚可</h3>
<p>本米滬南）昨各帮來源共到十餘號、（貨共近三千石）其中薄稻祇二三儎、薄稻市色雖包胃停辦、得見定局、各厚粳以本街銷呆、形勢帶軟、行情貶落角許、觀其趨勢、以　新　　西新尙軟而論、則似乎再無步小之理、各色新粳仍以供求相仿、無榮辱、杜尖陳新均平庸新洋尖因去路不良、高者雖小無幾、而中次削去一二角　（滬北昨河下各路來船祇四五號、市上各貨去胃，白史交易稍活、價形高料平疲、中次略轉緊勢、薄稻到少銷平、價形平疲、白元定局、新平尖到雖不多、另銷呆木、價小二三角、東新更到千石、另拆仍呆、　形勉立、新客尖到銷兩平、市形定勢、</p>
<p>洋昨日洋客秈市况、已轉平定之局、各路客秈到頭仍湧、昨仍有　皖甬寗各埠裝　、而江北機早新米亦有抵埠、市面本居平軟、幸本街辦　不弱、而天津帮亦有甬江機早之問訊、市面乃得站住、高機米售價反得　站、各客秈共開</p>
<p>千四百包、　天津及內地去二百多包外、均由本街辦去、</p>
<p>洋米昨市亦見挺立、本街採辦高米外甬帮與內地則去中次貨、而天津帮突辦暹　碎米一千包、故人心轉好也、惟小絞米被早客秈軋脚無人問津、行情反小一角、全日開西貢小絞　邏各米四千多包、大半仍爲本市辦去云、</p>
<h3>新黃豆跌一角二三分</h3>
<p>昨日新荳市况、頗疲萎、因今庚年境尙屬豐稔、來源　多、銷胃力薄、人心不免虛弱、跌風比較更厲、上中關常州牛皮黃跌八九分至一角、下檔須猛挫一角二三分、九江豆因產地尙堅穩、故跌勢尙輕、但亦跌去五六分不等、計開牛皮黃三車價自三元四角四至三角八、蛙口較重者祇開三元零五分、九江城門豆成交四百包、價自三元五角至四角、</p>
<h3>糖市　潮靑已有裝出在途</h3>
<p>昨據汕頭電訊、潮靑登紀已解决、來貨正在裝輪、不日即可抵申、惟聞汕存不多、市價雖可看鬆、然恐未能過於便宜、查申市號存亦已有限、將俟後貨到申、方可續開、公會劃盤、趨勢平定、二四粗砂白現貨呌十七元二角、稍有成交、轉口新貨呌五元四角、陳貨呌五元三角未成、合作公司標售惠州粗白十六元九角半、成交一百七十包中砂白十六元半、成交五十包、荷粗白二千包、十七元二角未成交、</p>
<h3>五金　英鋼板漸臻活潑</h3>
<p>英鋼板新近因青島煙臺福建諸幫、均有有添辦、是以市情比前熱鬧、而本街交易、因機器廠船廠等亦有指辦、是以趨勢頗形活潑、價比前雖未見暴升狂漲、但其一種堅固狀態、則已非昔日可比、如二厘半開八元五角、半分七厘半六元、一分五元七角半、厚花色五元五角、查連日開出達六七百擔之多、聞底貨已屬不多、而來源又形寥少、來日情形、頗許樂觀、</p>
<h3>白鉛皮趨勢復活</h3>
<p>白鉛皮近來趨勢、又見復活、蓋客路已多下手添辦、而本街電池廠等、亦多買賣、是以成交尙爲良好、行情比前亦高起二角半至半元不等、如二號售二十四元、三號四號二十二元七角半、五號二十二元五角、六號七號二十一元五角、八號至粗花色、均估二十一元、聞昨交三四十桶、</p>
<h3>南北貨　新漳圓號盤略漲</h3>
<p>新漳州桂圓首批、共到三百外箱、其中號貨僅三分之一、大部份爲行方自辦之額、昨號方亦已盡數開出、查前輪非正式曾到三箱、開價不甚準確、此次比較開升一二元、至數角不等、後批多到或須回鬆、碼生晒圓肉、比之陳貨高出十餘元之多、到數不旺、可望暫立、</p>
<h3>絲茶　珍眉綠茶歐銷復暢</h3>
<p>洋莊綠茶市况、近兩週來、交易均趣寥落、昨英商同孚天裕福時錦隆杜德等行、對於婺源屯溪等路之珍眉綠茶、因得摩洛哥來電購買、復起開辦、全市交易頗不寂寞、人心轉趨興奮、高莊抽芯貨頂盤開出一百十八元、躉批貨、開出七十三四元、較前見跌二三三元、針眉秀眉貢熙等綠茶、亦均有零星銷售、惟祁門浮梁至德等路紅茶、昨市仍無交易云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　呢羢到貨多上關機竺待售</h3>
<p>呢羢生意漸見熱鬧、然皆化整爲零、冬數尙須放賬、用支票算上好戶頭、求現交則不可得、人字呢馬褲呢西裝呢平厚呢各種男女色大衣呢等、近日俱有大量進口、然十之六七皆上關棧、待有受主冉行報關納稅出貨、實爲銀根不鬆也、</p>

<p>天下最樂的事，要在最苦中求之，俗話說「妻不如妾，妾不如婢，婢不如偸，偸不如偸不到手。』正是這兩句話的註脚。</p>
<p>「世風日下」，這一句話，相沿已經不知若千年了。果眞是這樣「日下」的話，這若干年下來，還有世界嗎？這種「是古疑今」的心理，我以爲正是中國積弱的病根，其實自保守派的眼裏看出來的「日下」的「世風，」未始不就是世界的進步哩。</p>
<p>天下的壞人，都是所謂好人者逼迫出來的，沒有好人，便造不出這許多壞人來，好人越多，壞人也就跟着多起來，我要學韓愈的話，說一聲「好人不死，壞人不止」。</p>
<h3>國民性的一斑</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>我國國民性善於慕仿，崇尙虛僞，證於左面的兩件事而益信。</p>
<p>毛邊的書西洋文化普及，一書出版，動輒銷數百萬冊。有裝訂甫就，不及截切，已須應市的，於是毛邊書流行坊間，這原是不得已之事，並非毛邊書有什麼的優長。不料這種書到了我國，我國人士相率以爲時髦，紛紛的幕仿着，那些新文化書冊，大都毛邊，其實我國不識字的尙居十之六七，供過於求，儘有從容截切的時間，情形不同，何必如此草率將事。而一般靑年學子，買書歸去，郤用一把小洋刀，且讀且裁，不怕麻煩，反以爲不如此不足以添興味呢</p>
<p>藝術家的髮西洋的藝術家，因專心致志於技巧方面，往往一任髭長髮亂，不加薙櫛，這原和我國從前的名士囚首垢面，同一旨趣。不料近來我國有一般少年，故意蓄着長髮，有似荒荆亂草，自以爲這是藝術家式。豈知這班少年，對於藝術，毫無門徑可言，醉生夢死，却也摹仿人家，用藝術家來做幌子，這是多可笑啊。</p>
<h3>車中</h3>
<p>— 思高</p>
<p>電車停了，東新橋。</p>
<p>在將開的時候，上來一位十分麼登的女郞，夾着小皮包，提着花紙小傘，雖然太陽早已在地平綫之下。</p>
<p>車中本來不空，我和其他兩個乘客都站着，這一站新添了幾個人。便顯得擁擠。這位女郞站在我身旁—並沒有人讓座，香氣襲人。我素來怕那一類香粉香水精，就狠狠地釘伊一個白眼，那知事情便從此展開。</p>
<p>伊在以爲我不留意的時候，從小皮包裹拿出一封信，故意落在地板上，好久不拾。又過了兩站，車中人稀了，我坐下來，伊　緊坐在我身邊。一會兒，伊忽然像發現什麽似的，急急忙忙地拾起那封信，轉過身來，仰着臉笑眯眯地對我說：「先生，你的信掉了！」一面又不住的做媚態。</p>
<p>我隨手接過來一看，見信封上歪歪斜斜的寫了「請拆」兩個鋼筆字，一時「禍」至心靈，早已明白「那個」，立卽喊了賣票來，笑着說：「不知誰的信遺失在這裏，帶到寫字間裏去吧！」說着便把那信交給他。那賣票的也笑嘻嘻地看看信封，看看伊，又看看我。</p>
<p>於是車中的人都向伊注意起來，直望得伊坐立不安。又是一個站頭，伊急匆匆地若有所失地下去。我心裏暗想道：好險啊！</p>
<h3>外國人</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>在我們的屋子裏，這次新遷進來了一家人家。雖然這家人家的人，也都是黃皮膚，黑頭髮，男的穿長衫，女的穿旗袍，正和我們一個兒模樣的，但是在遷進的那一天上，便有了一個「外國人」的尊號。</p>
<p>原因是上海的習慣，有新遷進來的，進門時，不拘大小的，得點一對天地燭。但是這家人家，却拒絕着燃點。他們說：「我們雖然不信敎，但也不信這些事情的。你們若一定要我們燃點香燭，我們寗可不租住這屋子。」於是同居者，對於這一家，便竊竊私議着有外國人脾氣的。</p>
<p>在遷進的第二天晚上，同居的打牌打到晚上十點半，「外國人」便出來干涉了，說的是吵得不能睡眠了。他們出進，是不怎麽和同居的招呼的。若有同居的婦女，進他們房去，他們便鄭重其事的請問「有何貴幹」？若是說不出貴幹來，便會受到冷待的。</p>
<p>他們家有一位主人的弟弟，因失了業，曾上門來向哥哥借錢。這位做哥哥的，却板起了臉不答應。他說：「我和你雖是兄弟，但是你也是有自立的能力的了，我若是再來供給你，郝我不啻是助成了你的依賴性了。歐美各國，儘有老子是大富翁，兒子當小工人的。雖說你是失業着，但你的失業可不干我事呀」</p>
<p>他的弟弟還想說話時，他竟拂袖上樓去了。於是同居的，對於這位「外國人」，更多了一層認識。</p>

<p>藍專員道？你知道我幹什麽的？我專門就是查辦你們這班招搖撞騙之徒的。你好大的膽，敢到太歲頭上來動十。張介夫臉上嚇得窗戶紙一樣的白，兩隻脚只管彈琵琶似的抖顫。藍專員道：你在外面散謠言，說是我的親戚，我和你是什麼親戚？你說　說着，將手在桌上重重的一拍。介夫剛才喜歡得要由口腔裏跳出來的那顆心，這時却只管下沉，幾乎要沉到和大便同排洩出來。口裏斯斯的道：沒有敢這樣說。藍專員道：我能誣賴你這樣一個脚色嗎？不但有人報吿我，而且你剛才和一個姓李的在那　吹牛的時候，我也派了人去聽得淸楚。介夫倒不料他有這着棋，只得低聲道：介夫是說和裘書記沾　並非是說和專員沾親。藍專員道：你和裘書記沾親嗎？那很好，可以叫他來對質，便向站在房門口的聽差道：把裘書記叫來，那裘則誠早在房門外伺候，聽了這話，便一側身子走了進來，看到張介夫站在這裏，先就釘了他一眼。然後在一邊站定。藍專員道：則誠，你有這麽一個親戚嗎？說着，向介夫一指。則誠道：我和他不過是同鄉，並不沾親。（三〇四）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>「啊！眞是了不得！我們一向聽人家說外國人是怎樣的聰明靈巧，現在果然蹬實了！」隨後伊就向我說道：「有人曾經吿訴我，西洋人有法子能够把許多的東西使他們返本還原，我先是不甚相信，這一回可眞做出來了！想不到這樣淸得像水一樣的東西，竟會把我們的頭髮染得像墨一樣的黑，又不沾污我們的頭皮，眞不知是什麽法兒？」</p>
<p>父親埋怨我不該多管閑事，却不料竟被我管得很圓滿了！太后自然不住的把我稱讚，又特地敎人去挑了一件伊年輕時所穿的旗袍來賞賜給我，作爲我應得的一種報酬。我細瞧伊所賞給我的那件旗袍委實是非常美麗，上面還繡着許多的蘭花；這是因爲伊老人家初進宮來的時候，咸豐皇帝給伊的封號是「蘭貴妃，」所以伊年輕時的服飾上頗多特繡蘭花的。後來伊做了皇太后，這種繡蘭花的衣服自然不再穿了，而別的人也因惟恐觸犯伊年輕時的名諱的緣故，誰也不敢在衣飾上堆繡蘭花的花樣；這日我雖一樣的叩頭領賞，但畢竟不敢穿起來，只得好好地把它收藏着，一直到如今，還不曾棄去。算來這件旗袍的高壽，到此刻爲止，最少也有八十年了，但因質料精良，再加我自己又收藏得仔細，所以它的色彩和光澤竟並不曾减退，還是像一件才做成的新衣服一般的鮮艷。（四〇四）</p>
<p>世界珍聞</p>
<h3>天空中的茶會</h3>
<p>— 禧</p>
<p>現在上海交際塲中很流行一種茶會，凡是歡送和歡迎什麼要人名流出國回國，往往舉行一個盛大的茶會，表示敬意。不過這種茶會，總是在大飯店或私家的花園中舉行，那就沒有西方人在天空中舉行茶會來得會白相了</p>
<p>一九三一年九月，英京倫敦城中，有男女二十人，坐了汽車從城心出發，到克洛登飛機塲去。他們先在這鼎鼎有名的飛機塲中，遊行了一週，然後坐上了那皇家大　機作半小時的飛行，就在這時間內，舉行了一個空中茶會。其興味之濃厚，實在地下任何茶會之上，造成了倫教航空史中最新奇的一頁。</p>
<p>據二十人中一位蒲德氏自述當時的情形，很有一記的價値。他說：</p>
<p>『當我們一羣人聚集在克洛登飛機塲的大廳中，大家的臉上都現出一副緊張的神情，連一絲笑容都沒有，對於以後半小時的經歷，心中都在作種種的揣測，在許多作長途飛行的人瞧來，一定是以爲滑稽可笑的。</p>
<p>『我們第一件激動的事，就是一眼瞧見那大怪物躺在那裏，我們將借它作爲舉行茶會的客廳之用。它名喚「可文德來城」號，是一架裝有二十個座位的飛機，常常飛行在歐洲全部的天空中的。一小隊的機師，像螞蟻般爬在它身上的各部，正在作最後的察看與整理。</p>
<p>『忽然聲怒吼，把我們嚇了一大跳，幾乎要逃出飛機塲，跑回倫敦去，原來那飛機上三部大引擎的推進機已轉動起來，發出一片怒吼似的聲響，當下我們奉命入到機中，各自就座</p>
<p>『我們爬進了接近機尾的一扇小門，見是一間像地底火車車廂似的小房，不過兩面都是單人的座位，而中間留出一條狹狹的人行道來。兩而窗子敞開，四面可以很暢快的瞧到上下的一切景物。</p>
<p>『末後我們的飛機在地上平行了一程路，然後漸漸地上昇起來，我們便開始飛行了。</p>
<p>『在我們二十人中，一大半的人都是第一次坐飛機，雖據專家說：近來通國人民對於飛機的興趣，一天天的增加起來，但是普通的人，覺得飛行總是一件很刺激的事情。</p>
<p>『那引擎軋軋的聲響，震耳欲聾，使我們再也不能談話，只瞧了各人面部的表情，就可知道大家是激動得什麼似的。最有趣的是十位平日間談笑風生的女客，到此都箝口結舌，連一句話都說不出來了。所以這半小時間，我們倒好似舉行了一個啞茶會。</p>
<p>『我們飛到了一個最高的速度。這數分鐘中幾乎瞧不出下面公園中和街道上的人形，在飛回倫敦的路中，我們所瞧見的第一件東西，便是那座著名的水晶宮，但因飛得太高，瞧下去乎平的，好似畫在地面上的東西。</p>
<p>『我正瞥見塔橋的當兒，忽覺得有人在我肩上叩了一下，原來茶點已準備好了。一個穿制服的管事，遞了一杯茶給我，並在我耳邊大聲問道：「先生，你要一塊糖呢還是兩塊糖？再要吃些什麼東西麽？」我放聲答道：「請你給我一塊糖，咦！對不起，我不要再吃別的東西了。」這時我們已高高的飛到了三千英尺以上</p>
<p>『這一天午後，我們所受到的最大的刺激，是在那飛機一轉側之間，我們眼見一張挺大的翼子，突然間飛騰上來，而地下的一切，都像閃電一般飛開去了。我們停神一看，才知道那飛機已轉了一個身。</p>
<p>『我們在天空中雖有半小時之久，却快得好像半分鐘一樣，只聽得那引擎的聲昔，漸漸地低下來，一會兒，我們已在克洛登的上空，開始下降。所有屋宇樹木和人類，一一回復了原形，我們在草地上掠過了幾秒鐘，纔在飛機棚前停住了。</p>
<p>『我們從飛機中走下來時，十隻烟捲匣，不約而同的從十位男客的衣袋中取出來，十枝小小的烟捲，不約而同的放到十張嘴上去，原來我們已有半小時不和它親近了。這天空中的茶會，什麼都感到興趣，唯一的憾事，就是沒有烟捲吸，因爲我們的東道主飛機小姐，是絕對不許人家吸烟的。』</p>

<h3>水癌</h3>
<p>— 姚爾昌醫師</p>
<p>本症亦爲臨床常見侵害嬰兒之疾病也。病原不明。常由腸熱白喉所引起。或續發於大病之後。發病先於口腔內小曰齒粘膜處生一限局性暗色浸潤。短期內卽成壞疽。面頰部因之浮腫或蔓延迅速侵及全頰。繼而破壞發臭。附近淋巴腺腫大。其他一般症狀。如患者在虛弱日甚時。或發中毒症狀（頭痛，發熱，昏迷，囈語，等）如毒汁嚥下。致引起壤疽性肺炎或下痢。其最後致死。多因驟起虛脫。治愈殊少。故預後不佳。對於本症之治療。如能早日口腔消毒。體力維持佳良。或可治愈也。</p>
<h3>一般之神經衰弱症現象</h3>
<p>— 任國祥醫師</p>
<p>神經衰弱一症。患者甚多。其初步輕微者。人每不自覺。其稍深者。因尙無不能忍受之疼痛。故人亦往往忽之。迨其病根漸深。身心感受影響。變症百出。勢成燎原。始亟亟求治。治療當然較初起時費事。以大好有爲之身體。不自惜護。因循自誤。不亦可憫乎。</p>
<p>神經衰弱雖有腦部與性部之別。要知人體構造。息息相關。腦部而下。當脊相連。凡性慾過度者。腦部未有不蒙其直接影響者。換言之。卽腦部不能得其充分之營養。而發生一切衰弱之現象也。</p>
<p>一般神經衰弱之現象。大槪爲萎靡不振。易感疲乏。失眠健忘。臨事失職。以及心悸腰酸。未老先衰也。其病原在內分泌之欠缺。如投以「生殖素」。則內分泌充實。四肢百骸。得其營養。上述諸症。不驅自除。故「生殖素」者。洵最近最新最完善之神經衰弱症針對良劑也。</p>
<h3>腎虧不姙之治療經過</h3>
<p>— 馮國璋來稿</p>
<p>結褵之前。余因手淫而遺精。婚後迄今，已將三載矣。非但生育無望。而腎虧衰弱。毫無人生樂趣。同時呈現種種症象。例如頭昏腰酸。手顫脚軟。心悸失眠。神志不淸，怠倦無力……等等。不一而足。兼以記憶力無形减退。所作所爲。移時則模糊莫辨。身體稍微動作。汗卽汨然而出。精神肉體之痛苦。可謂至乎其極。亦曾注射補針等。終屬無效。後得故友指示至正威藥房購斯丹那氏生殖素服用。一瓶方盡。精神煥然。竊念該藥之靈。乃繼續服用半打。至是心曠神怡。腎力康健，全身疾病。一掃而盡。刻下內子己懷孕三月矣。</p>
<h3>嗚呼遺精病</h3>
<p>— 兪伯符醫師</p>
<p>精爲赤血所聚。蓄之甚難。</p>
<p>一般靑年。不知自惜。或以手淫戕傷。或以性慾過度。遂致精液耗竭。身體日趨孱弱。健康無望。幸福難期。鳴呼。不亦大可憫哉。</p>
<p>夫人身四肢百骸。直接受血液之流通。間接藉精液之營養。而以腦髓爲尤甚。蓋腦部而下。有脊連貫。精液如洩漏過度。腦髓卽蒙其病害。於是腦神經首先衰弱。而起失眠。健忘。思慮不能集中。遇事厭倦易疲等症。更久則腰酸背痛。未老先衰。腎虧萎靡等症。繼之而起。於是病體頹唐。百患叢生。人生至此興趣索然。</p>
<p>治療之法。一面當卽速內服希米脫氏「固精片」。去遺精之痼疾。一面當內服斯丹那氏內分泌製劑「生殖素」。使神經恢復。臟器充盈。健康幸福。于焉兩得。遺精病患者。其注意之。</p>
<h3>從婦女白帶說到療帶靈</h3>
<p>— 費君輔醫師</p>
<p>吾國婦女之患有白帶者。十居八九。惟因患者之多。一般人輙不加注意。殊知此種疾患。不僅危害婦女健康。抑且有傷種族强健。可慨者。一般婦女均惑於舊禮敎之傳統觀念。不願向人道及。更不願坦然求醫。爲彌補此種錯誤觀念及便於自療起見。則療帶靈實有介紹之必要也。</p>
<p>療帶靈爲婦女白帶之特效外用藥。不僅具有殺菌消毒之功能。而且可以淸透膿性分泌物及扶助有益之膣桿菌之繁殖。故凡子宮頸管炎，子宮炎，淋菌性膣炎及外陰部濕潤糜爛等症侯。用之無不立奏奇效。此皆余臨床經騐所得。推誠寫來。以冀盡吾輩醫師介紹良藥之職責耳。</p>
<h3>遺精療法之又一例</h3>
<p>— 任國祥醫師</p>
<p>患者陳明謙。男性。二十六歲。寗波人。十五歲時。受同輩引誘。曾犯手淫過度。至十九歲。忽患遺精甚烈。身體漸次衰弱。四肢無力。記憶健忘。精神萎靡。面黃肌瘦。頭腦昏暈。多夢失眠。食慾不佳。當時旣未得良醫治療。復不得良藥服用。因循自誤。四五年來。患者意志頹喪。遍請名醫治療。未有確效。邇復病勢纏綿。痛苦劇增。腰酸背痛。心房衰弱。耳鳴目眩。呻吟病榻。家人爲之心焦。後由戚友介紹至余處求治。余卽投以希米脫氏固精片使之內服。不數日遺精停止。同時又以生殖素補其體虛。數週間。患者霍然痊愈。多年痼疾。轉瞬恢復健康。欣喜已極。謂希米脫氏固精片誠爲遺精之神藥也云。</p>

<h3>超外差式的局外週率振盪器</h3>
<p>— KMK</p>
<p>無論是一具超外差式的收音機Superhetrodyne，Receiver）抑是一具回授式的收音機，（Regrenerative，Receiver）其效率之最優越及最靈敏點，則正在檢波眞空管之將起振盪，（Oscollator）而尙未趨强之際，故此無綫電的在某種工作上，都需要有眞空管而起的平衡振盪電流，以發揮其充分的特性，使工作效率臻於優越之境，雖然振盪器的主動器是用一枚（兩極或三極）眞空管來担任的，可是欲得以平衡的及各種强弱不同的振盪，則全依賴屬於屏極電路及柵極電路的感應綫圈，所以，感應綫圈在振盪器中其自感量更屬重要，故吾人須更加以精細之設計也。</p>
<p>本文所介紹的「超外差式的局外週率振盪器；」Supetheterodyne　of　BeatFrcquency　Oscillator）係超外差式收音機中最易設計之一種，在一九三三至一九三四年的鷹王牌收音機多係探用此式振盪器者，以取其製造便利，和效率穩定，見附圖所示，振盪器的主動發振點，是假用第一檢波眞空管的陰極（Cathode）和屏極所担任的，至於振盪器的發振綫圈係採自串聯式，（設置於局外部份，以免影響其選擇性，）以節省設計及製造時之麻煩，膠紙軸的外徑爲一又四分之一英吋，以三十四號美國標準漆包綫製繞，A至B之間計五圈，B至C之間計四十二圈，C至D之間計六圈，（自始至終共爲五十三圈，）綫圈外週須加隔離罩，（見圖虛綫週圍者，）C爲〇·〇〇〇三六MFD變量電容器，C1C3皆爲〇·〇〇〇五MFD（絕緣性上質的，）固定電容器，C2爲〇·一MFD固定電容器，耐壓在四〇〇弗打以上，R爲六五〇歐姆固定耗阻器，R1爲兩枚五〇〇〇〇歐姆固定耗阻器串聯而成，能通過電力在二瓦特以上，否則極易發熱，在此器作就後，倘尙嫌振盪電流之强弱過荷，祗須將C3之容量換以較大或較小卽可，毋須將綫圈之自感量加以更改。</p>
<h3>與全金屬眞空管性質相彷之新式眞空管</h3>
<p>— 泡</p>
<p>自奇異公司宣佈其「全金屬式眞空管』之後，美國無綫電製造廠商卽加以深切的注意，甚至引起筆墨官司。各有關係之製造廠，無一不在曙中進行，以謀染指於此新興之市塲。最近製造「愛斯牌」（Arcturus）眞空管的製造廠，更新出一種別出心裁的眞空管，其特性及底座接法，完全與全金屬式者一式無二；所異者不過仍襲用老式眞空管之玻璃泡耳。</p>
<p>此種眞空管之命名原則，與全金屬者相同，但其後殿以G字（卽Glass之第一字母）以爲分別。例如「6K7G」，卽表示特性及底座接法，與6K7號全金屬眞空管相同的玻璃泡眞空管。其外形見附圖，圖中左方爲玻璃式者，右方之影則爲一枚全金屬式者。</p>
<p>此類眞空管已製造應市者，有五柵週率變換管，通用三極管，三極輸出管，高放大係數（Highmu）三極管，五極輸出管，雙屏管，五極高放管，五極檢波管，五柵混合管，及全波整流管，種類之多，已足供一般採用。</p>
<p>全金屬眞空管雖已在大批製造，但實際技術上不無相當問題，而此種玻璃泡式者，因有過去製造普通眞空管之經騐可按，製造時無異駕輕就熟。聞現已有若干收音機製造廠，已在開始製造應用此式眞空管之收音機矣。</p>
<h3>新式1B5直流雙屏三極眞空管</h3>

<p>最近美國Hygrad　Sylvania　Colporation新出一種直流省電式雙屏三極管，管式爲1B5</p>
<p>1B5眞空管，內部由一三極部分曁一雙屏極所組成，適合應用於直流超外差式收音機中担任第二檢波兼放大自動音量控制等工作，蓋三極部分與雙屏除發射電子的絲極屬於公共者之外，兩者間絕對不相關，所以在綫路中一似使用兩枚眞空管而毫無困難。</p>
<p>在實際上，1B5之構造實與交流眞空管55，75，85各式無異，僅絲極因由直流電供給，所以不需陰極之設備。</p>
<p>其特性如左：</p>
<p>絲極電壓　二弗打</p>
<p>絲極電流　·〇六安培</p>
<p>屏極電壓　一三五弗打</p>
<p>屏極電流　·八千分安培</p>
<p>柵極電壓　負三弗打</p>
<p>屏極阻力　三五〇〇〇歐姆</p>
<p>互導率　五七五兆分漠</p>
<p>放大因數　二十</p>
<h3>業餘雜談</h3>
<p>— 吳英劍</p>
<p>收聽短波的時侯，往往每易將微弱的短波電台旋過。因爲這種微弱的電訊，不能像廣波段那樣在揚聲器或聽筒中，有一種襲擊的聲浪發出，所以極易忽略過去。最近美國流行一種眞空管的裝置，牠能帮助短波機尋覓微弱的短波電臺，應用在外差式短波機上有特殊之功效（高週率放大式者不合用），美國最新的外差式短波收音機中，已有此種裝置，英文名曰“Beat　Oscillator”當這機件接到外差式短波機上，把開關開上，而旋轉收音機的度盤至一微弱的短波電臺的時候，收音機內立卽發出一種噓嘯的聲音，假如再繼續旋轉度盤，而經過這電臺，那末噓嘯聲亦就立卽停止。所以有了這種裝置，微弱的短波電臺，就極易收到而不致遺漏了。只要俟收音機內發生噓嘯聲，然後將此機的開關關上，電臺的播音，就能在揚聲器或聽筒中聽聞了。不過有一點須加注意的，就是假如收音機的中間週率是四五六千週（456KC），那末此機須校正到四六六千週。換言之，必須超過原機一千週，否則就不能發生效果。因爲這樣方始纔能得到一千週的聲音，蓋原述二週率（456KC與456KC）不能聽聞，而一千週聲音是爲人耳所能聽聞的。</p>
<p>附圖是這種機件的綫路，採用二枚三十七號三極管，一端爲電源進綫，接一百十弗打交流或直流均可，另一端外差式短波收音機的中間週率放大管，或第二檢波管的柵極。此機接至收音機上後，除上述作用之外，對於收音機完全不發生別的影饗。另件已註於綫路圖中，不再另述。</p>
<h3>遙遠控制的音量調節器</h3>
<p>— 陸植民</p>
<p>音量調節器在一般的收音機上是必不可少的，新式的收音機上則有自動音量調節器之設備。但這並非是普通情形，因爲有許多收音機並沒有這種設備，也許連收音機上普通音量調節器都沒有也說不定。就是普通的音量調節器在使用時，我們還覺得十分便利。要是你坐在離開收音機很遠的座中在靜聽，忽然遇到響的刺耳的聲音發現時，你非得走近收音機旁調節不可，這多麽麻煩。但假使你有遙遠控制的音量調節器（Remotovolume　Control）放在座旁，那末你儘可適意地坐在座中，將那個調節器輕輕底一旋轉，刺耳的聲音立刻變爲柔和的音調從揚聲器中發放出來。因爲遙遠控制的音量調節有這種優點，所以這裏就介紹你一隻在電動揚聲器上所用的遙遠控制音量調節器，如圖一所示，用一隻電位器（四十歐姆）並聯在音圈和輸出變壓器的次級上。你可把電位器裝在美觀的小木匣中，接綫可用長的花綫，以便移動。圖一那種接法較之圖二那樣用活動電阻來的高妙。並且還能使音調（Tone　Quality）更加美滿，不過有幾隻揚聲器須要接二十歐姆的電位器才會得良好的成績呢。</p>
<h3>全波收音機</h3>
<p>— 泡</p>
<p>能收受十餘公尺至二百公尺的短波段，與二百公尺至五百五十公尺的廣播段的收音機，就是「全波收音機」。</p>
<p>因爲短波段播音臺的增加，目下市上已有多種全波收音機出現，未來的收音機更將因事實的需要而趨向全波式，則可逆料。</p>
<p>全波收音機，所以遲遲不能大量製造者，實由一種成見所致，原全波收音機中更換波段的方法，普通可分二種：甲　用揷入式綫圈以更換配諧回路中的自感量，乙用分綫器裝置（SwitchingArangement）以達到同一目的。乙法裝置旣簡，使用又便，遠非甲法可望其項背，但以爲效力不及甲法者，頗有其人，此實爲全波收音機發展上之一大障礙。但實際上，倘能設計適當，乙法亦殊不遜甲法也。</p>
<p>業餘家的短波收音機上，有多種目經騐得到的裝置，或將因事實上的爲要，而普遍的加裝於全波收音機上。譬如：用極犬刻度盤使其十分之一度，尙能用目力分辨，使用配諧容易的「波段放大」裝置；使用能發揮最大效力的「天綫回路配諧電容器」；以及照耀刻度盤，使讀度數能快捷準確的裝置等等：此等裝置，皆有便利收受短波電訊的眞價値，而値得加裝於全波收音機者。</p>
<p>接收短波電訊時，「寰落』現象特別顯著，訊號時强時弱，甚至時有時無；故自動音量控制（Automatie　Volume　Control），亦爲時代全波收音機所不可缺的裝置。關於此種裝置，目下埋首研究者，大有人在，將來全波收音機中必有更完美的自動音量控制設備，使音量能始終維持不變，以制勝此可厭之衰落現象。</p>
<h3>展望臺</h3>
<p>— 春</p>
<p>據「金圓王國」當局之調查，北美計有收日機一九七六九〇四五具，廣播電臺八三九座。最近歐洲無綫電界進步亦極速，計全歐有收音機一八五七二三八〇具，廣播電臺二七六座。全世界總計有收音機四二五一六九〇四具，廣播電臺一六九四座。</p>
<p>歐洲各國之無綫電事業，最近以德國進步最速，計今年正月份一月內，增加聽衆三十萬。因德國提倡國民收音機極爲熱烈，務使無綫電於短期內普及全國云。國社黨宣傳部長郭培爾曾言：「只有無綫電，是政府與民衆聯絡起來唯一的橋樑，和敎育民衆的利器。」（國民收音機是德國政府爲使無綫電普及化而設計的非常低廉的收音機，每部約値七十六馬克。）</p>
<p>據美國司太契博士調查，去年計有八十萬輛汽車，裝置無綫電，全美有兩具以上收音機的聽衆佔二百二十九萬五千七百七十家以上。聽衆每月收入在二百元左右者爲最多，農民次之。</p>
<p>加拿大當局近禁止各電臺於星期日播送廣吿節目。</p>
<p>歐洲各國之廣播事業，均由政府加以統制，電臺賴收聽費以維持，惟美國則適相反，聽衆可不必繳納收聽費，各電臺則純賴播送廣吿，收取費用，以資開支，該項廣吿費用，全美於去年一年中，計繼七千三百萬美金云。</p>
<p>世界各廣播電臺之電力，以蘇聯之莫斯科電臺爲最大，計五百KW，美國之新西娜，亦有五百KW電臺一座，惟僅作試騐用。</p>
<p>出版界</p>
<h3>中國思想界之巨浪</h3>
<p>— 室伏高信</p>
<p>這裏要講到「一十宣言」。所謂一十宣言，卽一月十日的宣言之意。今年一月十日，陶希聖薩孟武等現代中國之第一流敎授十人，發表一個共同宣言。這就是所謂中國本位的文化建設宣言。</p>
<p>在這以前，去年三月，曾有中國文化建設恊會的組織，上海，福建，河北，甘肅各地，都成立分會，到了十月，乃有名曰「文化建設」的機關雜誌的發刋。這篇十敎授的共同宣言，卽發表於該刋及上海第一報紙申報，與其他報紙，立刻捲起了全國的激動，凡是中國當代的學者或思想家，幾可說無一人不談到這問題，中國的思想界，現正以此問題爲中心，顯示着新的展開。</p>
<p>十敎授的所謂「一十宣言」，在某一點，實是很妥恊的，懷疑的，大如左顧右盼，沒有中心的把握似的。也許這正代表着生長於近代的敎養中之知識分子的一般的悲劇，就這點言，這個宣言，如蔡元培氏所言是沒有什麽的，又如胡適之之言，是舊思想的新式化裝；但是，他所激成的波浪，實非常巨大。從這裏，我們見到了時代的金石相擊聲。</p>
<p>一十宣言强調着「此時此地」，竭力以求立脚於現實與此現實的方向，這一點，與單純的回顧思想及反動主義，大有區別。並且，他們也要求有所不同。如「不守舊」與「不盲從」是。以後他們更說到「檢討過去，把握現在，創造將來。」</p>
<p>從這點來看，在他們的宣言中，是並沒有新的提示，可　批判的事物，並且也沒有什麽問題提了出來。誠然，這可以視爲一種達爾文的進化論，或黑格爾的發展說，但在現今，似沒有宣言的必要。</p>
<p>他們繼着自己說明，採其長，捨其短，擇其善者而從之。這是孔子所謂三人行，必有我師焉。如胡適之所言，在這一點，宣言是沒有超過康有爲梁啟超一步。但是我們在批評宣言之前，對於其全面的意義，便是其時代的意味，不可不有所把握。</p>
<p>一十宣言之要點，在强調中國文化或中國本位的文化，這是不待言的。宣言說「在文化的頒域中，我們看不見現在的中國了。」中國已消失於濃霧中，暗中摸索，上不着天，下不着地，漂泊流浪於虛無的境界。不論政治，經濟，社會，思想，都是這樣。</p>
<p>「要使中國能在文化的領域中抬頭，」宣言接下去說，那末必須使政治社會思想，都具有中國的特長，卽中國本位的文化建設。中國是中國，故必須本其自己的特殊性，以創造文化。</p>
<p>問題是在這裏。中國本位文化卽國民主義文化的創造，這是要點所在，也是成爲問題之點。而所以捲起巨大的激動，也就是在這一點。</p>
<p>他們說檢討過去，說批評的態度，說科學的方法，以强調「此時此地」。但此所謂「此時此地」是指中國，故所謂檢討過去，在憧憬於過去的遺產，以春秋戰國時代比之歐洲歷史之希臘羅馬文化。他們欲以此歷史爲基礎，把握中國之「此時此地」，因之而創造中國特有的文化。在世界文化的波濤上，他們回顧他們的過去，自己醒覺，自已己反省，而在樓倣與翻譯之長久記錄後，繼續自己的再評價，以創造自己。</p>
<p>自曾國藩李鴻章輸入歐西文明，中國雖沒有如日本那樣的急速，但却是向着近代化的路而前進的。尤其自世界大戰到一九二七年北伐革命前後，中國　以非常之勢趨於近代化。中國的思想界，當然亦不能外此。</p>
<p>這其間有康有爲梁啟超二大思想家，在西歐主義的巨風中，他們警吿着中國不應喪失他自己，要求國民應該尊重中國自己文化的遺產。但是他們只是約翰，却不是基督。「羊不聽其聲音」，時代却把他們葬送於「反動思想家」的陣營，而向着舐吮西歐思想之糟粕一途以前進。</p>
<p>國民黨治世之八年在中國是很好的試煉。這個試煉，今尙繼續着。中國究竟能否受得起這試煉不能呢，這不是問題所在，惟從這時代，却得到了一種敎訓，似已無可疑，至少盲目的崇拜西洋的時代，現在是過去了，這是確定的事實。中國本位的文化運動，便是表示中國思想家，同時卽中國國民生活的一種新的轉換。（一羽譯自讀賣新聞八月二十三日）</p>
<h3>審査出版物應注意的幾件事</h3>
<p>— 張素民</p>
<p>我們對於出版物不僅希望其多，而且希望其好。出版物之好壞，就以審查出版物之方式為轉移。所以從出版家的觀點言，審查出版物，是一件極重要的事。據我所知，出版家審查出版物，至少應注意下列幾件事：</p>
<p>一·注意文字—將要排印在紙上的文字，是不可「苟且」的。中國在由話文未通行之前，一切書報的文字，均頗可觀。無論其內容如何，文字總是通順的。即拿雜誌講，梁啟超主編的庸言，國風，和大中華，章行嚴主編的甲寅，文章固好，即劉師復宣傳無政府主義的民聲週刊，文字亦佳。自從白話文通行以來，彷彿人人可以寫書做文章，於是書報雖加多，，而文字好的極少。我幷不是推崇文言，反對白話，也不是提倡文學。乃是說印在書報上的文字，無論爲文言或白話，至少必須通順流暢，可使讀者瞭解。今日流行的英文，固爲白話，然英美書籍雜誌上的文字，是很愼重的。英美出版家對於文字稍有毛病的稿件，立即退回。投稿者因此養成習慣，若明知自己的文字不甚佳，必先請人修改然後投稿。中國今日之文字最壞的出版物，即是翻譯的書籍或論文。其原因，是譯者未深通所譯的那國文字和未精研所譯的書籍或論文所討論的那門科學。出版家只見其書名或論文題目時髦，沒有做逐字逐句的審查校訂功夫，就把那種稿件印出來。讀者不信，試任意抽一本翻譯的書或一本雜誌上所載的譯文，把牠細讀，必發現許多費解之處。若把牠和原文對閱，即可發現許多錯誤。譯文固也有好的，然中國今日翻譯的專門高深書籍，如某書店出版的馬雪耳的經濟學原理之類，我敢說是不可讀的。因爲馬雪耳的書，原文已不易讀，譯爲中文，不是一件容易事。要動手譯這種書，必對於馬雪耳有特別的研究，好比英人William　Smart譯奧國學者Bobm-Bawerk的「資本積極論」一樣。那書店隨便承印這種譯本，不僅缺乏常識，而且對於稿件上文字的審查，太不注意了。總之，出版家審查稿件，無論其爲創作或編著或翻譯，應首先注重文字的簡潔通順。</p>
<p>二·注重內容。——出版家審查稿件，覺其文字通順之後，就應考察其內容。所謂內容，包括甚多。如材料之是否豐富及其來源若何，分析之是否精密及其方法若何，結論之是否正確及其邏輯若何。他如章節段落之分配是否得宜，引證之事實有無根據，參考之書籍是否列出，前後之議論是否聯貫，所用之術語及私有名詞是否一致等皆是。我國近年來的出版物，內容好的固有，然內容不完善的居最多。內容壞得不堪的，也不少。因此，我希望出版家今後切實注重出版物之內容。</p>
<p>三·注重校對。——中國以前出版的綫裝書，校對仔細，錯字極少。今日西洋各國的書籍，也是一樣，以無錯誤爲原則，以一二錯宇爲例外。但中國近來出版的，大都錯誤頗多，足見校對之疎忽。我以爲這種錯誤之原因，不全在排字者，也不全在校對者，乃在底稿之潦草。我們以前的舊書錯字少，是因爲從前講究正楷和書法。一部付印的稿紙，從沒有潦草的。西文書籍錯字之少，也是因爲付印的稿紙，已由打字機打印得很淸楚的。試拿一部手寫的英文稿紙，交給任何外國印刷店，他是不會替你印刷的。爲免除排印錯誤過多起見，我想出版家可要求作者將底稿謄正，再行付印。如再有錯誤，當由校對者負責。</p>
<p>我想：一部出版物，文字通順，內容完善，誤字毫無。從出版家看來，精力不枉費，從投者看來，也自然心滿意得。區區平淡之詞，不知出版家以爲何如。</p>
<h3>元人小令集</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>開明書店印行　實價一元二角</p>
<p>陳乃乾先生所輯集的這本書，對於研究散曲的人是很有用處的。在十年以前普通最易得到的元代散曲集只是一部商務所覆印的元刋本「朝野新聲太平樂府」，雖是元刋本的眞相，字跡却極粗略，排得密密札札的，讀起來使人不快。並且人名的重見和曲調的誤收都容易領人到錯誤的路上去。例如開端的「太平樂府姓氏」，旣收劉時中，又收劉逋齋；旣收吳仁卿，又收吳克齋；旣收曾瑞卿，（即曾瑞）又收曾褐夫；旣收王愛山，又收王敬甫。這樣把一個人當作兩個人的錯誤，在「元人小令集裏是沒有的。劉時中沒有小令，其他如吳仁卿，曾瑞，王愛山等都只稱其名，不曾把他們分身化爲兩人</p>
<p>在曲調方面，太平樂府亦多錯誤。例如盧摯的節節高，太平樂府卷五入仙呂，元人小令集則入黃鍾；醉太平，太平樂府卷五入南呂，元人小令集則入正宮；關漢卿的白鶴子，太平樂府卷三入雙調，元人小令集則入正宮；一半兒，太平樂府卷五入黃鍾，元人小令集則入仙呂：賣花聲，太平樂府卷二入雙調，元人小令集則入中呂。查董康的曲目韻編（當係據九宮大成譜等書編輯者），都是元人小令集的對，而太平樂府的錯。賣花聲的第二格雖入雙調，但太平和小令集所收的徐德可失題四首，喬吉的孩兒香茶，張可久的席上，偶題，懷古，四時樂興和客况却都是用的正格或第一格。李元玉的北詞廣芷譜卷五中呂宮就收有張可久懷古的第二首，益可證明這七七七四四七的格調，是賣花聲的正格，應該屬於中呂，不屬於雙調了</p>
<p>任訥的散曲概論（散曲叢刊第十四種）用調第五列小令專用五十調，小令套曲兼用者六十九調，帶過曲調式三十四調，共計一百五十三調。元人小令集所收僅九十九調，却有好幾種是任訥所未收的，例如正宮脫布衫，仙呂哪吒令，鶕踏枝，靑哥兒，四季花，中呂醉春風，商調百字知秋令，雙調一錠銀等。最奇怪的是任書有「脫布衫帶小凉州」，而無脫布衫」。；有「哪吒令帶鵲踏枝」而無「哪吒令」和「鶕踏枝」；有「後庭花帶靑哥兒」而無「靑哥兒」。任書把賣花聲列入雙調，節節高列入仙呂，大約是上了太平樂府的當。</p>
<p>元人小令集把六么遍列入仙呂，也是很妥當的。原曲僅喬吉的一首「自述」：</p>
<p>不占龍頭選，不入名賢傳。時時酒聖，處處詩禪。烟霞狀元，江湖醉仙。笑談便是編修院，留連，批風切月四十年。</p>
<p>北詞廣正譜卷三仙呂宮六么遍所舉的例是朱庭玉的「可愛中秋」：</p>
<p>爛銀盤湧氷輪動。（輒）玻璃萬頃。無　無踪。今宵最好，來夜怎同？留戀嫦娥相陪奉，天公，莫敎消影轉梧桐。</p>
<p>與喬吉的「自述」幾乎完全相同；所不同的。祇是第一句喬吉爲十字二句，朱庭玉爲七宇一句，這不過是加了襯字而已。可見喬吉的六么遍確應歸入仙呂。任書把六么遍列入正宮，那另是一曲，別名呌做柳梢靑。</p>
<p>元人小令集附有人名索引，計九十三家；按調編列，共九十九調：這使我們知道元人作小令的有多少，常用的調子有多少，一覽便知元人小令的槪况。</p>
<p>所可惜的，元人小令集沒有一個輯錄時所用書的目錄。我希望他能够在再版時增補。同時我更熱望陳先生能繼元人小令集之後再編一部「元人套數集一來完成這「全元曲」的工作。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>馴羊呢？還是箭猪？</h3>
<p>— 吹</p>
<p>意相墨索里尼近日對於阿國的姿勢，大有破釜沉舟，用獅子搏兎之力，滅此朝食之槪。確眞，阿國雖得地利人和之助，到底一個蕞爾小國，怎當得最新式的飛機大砲去蹂躪，阿國的滅亡，早在我人意料之中。</p>
<p>不料最近阿國有一種流言，謂「墨索里尼將爲截獲一馴羊，不料遭遇一箭猪」，馴羊呢？箭猪呢？這問題猶待我人的考量，幷事後的證明。阿國雖號稱黑獅子王國，但以列强比起來，到底是隻羊，不過此羊不能算牠馴羊，只能算他是綿羊。因爲阿國的國王，曾經迭次宣稱，寗爲玉碎，不爲瓦全，卽有一兵一矢，還要反抗到底，這羊可算倔强極了。</p>
<p>卽以用兵而論，阿國多高山，深林，沙漠，故對阿用兵，頗不便利，幷且對於英國的利害，衝突十分密切。故此次戰事，卽使不致擴大，但以阿國民情的强悍剛果，和水土的不相宜，高山深林的障碍，欲滅此朝食，已不容易。萬一戰事擴大，或竟引起第二次的大戰，則馴羊和箭豬，眞有些莫能澦料。</p>
<p>但是現在帝國主義者的氣燄，已高萬丈，卽使炸彈，尙且不放在心上，區區箭猪，原是不在話下。但是此種主義，蔓延開來，殖民地的掠奪，便爲國家最高的目的，完全成爲弱肉强食的世界，種瓜得瓜，種荳得荳，惡因所積，他日必有任其咎者，當歐戰以後，痛定思痛，亦曾一度思及東方之文明，但日久漸忘，而第二次的大戰又將爆發矣。</p>
<p>但是列强到底是列强，不久以前，墨氏曾作强硬的宣言，謂如有人阻止對阿用兵的舉動者，我必以武力折服之云云。但據昨日羅馬電稱，意國表示，不欲與國聯絕緣，且將宣言，尊重英國的權利，而法國亦反對對意施行制裁，並對意政府擬在九月四日在國聯行政院會議中提出意國之理由一節，表示滿意。果如此，列强已有妥協的表示，我想這樣情形，阿國還是做做馴羊罷，何必去做箭猪呢？眞是乖人不吃眼前虧，古人的話原是不差的。</p>
<h3>家常</h3>
<p>— 程銓</p>
<p>年靑的時代，捧着書本，在早晨的陽光的噴流中，在夜晚的淸澈的日光中，在女中音的唱着「甜蜜之家」的歌曲的曲折的聲調中，我曾時常地夢想到有個家：那麽輕鬆的，那麽柔和而美麗，如仲夏夜的小夢一樣的，那麼恬靜，和平而安適，如鳥兒的小窩一樣的，而最後，又是那麼像埃田樂園一樣的快樂，天眞而明朗的；在那兒，在我底家中，將永遠開放着響亮而淸明的笑，像常靑樹永遠在園子裏綠着一樣。</p>
<p>那麽一堆雲一般的飄渺而美麗的夢想，隨追着我底永遠是破碎得收拾不起來的生活，是已經有了好多好多年了啊（是的，在回憶中，那是一個不可想象的悠長的時期）！而今，我失掉了在初</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>三或十五夜間的月光下細讀雪萊抒情詩底幸福，而在勞瘁的爲着取得一些破殘的生活之奔走下，我失掉了靑春，失掉了少年時代的大聲的笑，失掉了如月光一樣美麗而朦朧的幻想曲；然而，我却開始有了一個家！</p>
<p>是一個確確實實的，屬於自己的家啊！</p>
<p>（朋友—他們是已經有了家的—拍着我底肩頭，一半像惡意的恫嚇，一半像善意的警吿，而事實上則是一個過來人對「生手」的驕傲與嘈弄，大聲地說：「好傢伙，你倒底也有了家了。好的，好好地去抓着它，別讓它使你頭痛，縐眉，或甚至於痛哭，那才是好傢伙呢！那……」</p>
<p>「見你們的鬼！」我是那麽誇大地，用了自信與驕傲的，頂粗魯而響亮的字眼回答了他們的。）</p>
<p>於是，我眞正地有了一個家了。</p>
<p>家，可眞是那麽一個家哪！我一天天地沈重地馱着它走去：一天天地，我也更多地看到了它，明白了它—明白了許多許多，那些，在年靑時代的幻想的夢裏是沒有的，而在那動了全世界人底心的「甜蜜之家」的歌聲，也找不出來的啊！</p>
<p>對於一個已經在家的重鎭下爬行着過來的人，這一點也許是不會十分驀生的：月頭月尾，在房租柴米上累出了一身不舒服的汗；於是，那些家常便開始來襲擊你了。和我一樣，妻，也是一個有着未来的理想。与对生活有了一点相当的计劃的人；可是不幸的是，那理想比我底更要高出許多倍（一），而這計劃也離現實太遠了。於是，處在這和理想現着那樣强烈的不調和的低級生活中，她是永遠（幾乎是立志）做了陰鬱的侶伴了；於是，晚上帶着一個疲乏的腦子，從公事房逃回家裏的時候，那放在書架上的一排對我幾乎成了可惡的嘈弄，如今領略的已經不是雪萊的抒情詩，而是妻底歇思底理亞的無聊的理想的背誦了，這，像一千根尖針那樣地，把我底臟拑住了；我難受得緊，我大聲地呼叱她，我簡直會發狂了！</p>
<p>可是，那「計劃」，那「理想」，那商量，在當初對我是一首最美麗的詩篇啊。（是的，不是爲了買一口橱的式樣，我們還不倦地曾講了三天嗎？）</p>
<p>日子過着過着，有了孩子了！孩子岔了出來，在我是一件頂可怕的事情！而頂高興的却是妻呢！她一點不覺得倦地整夜地和我談「育嬰法」之類的書的好壞，乳粉的牌子的好壞，於是，她一下子就說了十二種乳粉的名字。</p>
<p>我憤怒而疲倦，翻個身，打個呵欠，閉上了眼睛。</p>
<p>於是一種可怕的聲氣起來了：「怎麼？我說了半天，你不在聽嗎？」</p>
<p>「我才聽着的呀，親愛的！」於是，重新睜開眼來，拋棄了日間因爲在公文上脫落了一個字而受了經理的辱罵的追想，開始聽她叙述「勒吐精」的短長……</p>
<p>那麽着，我終於一天天地活着過來了。我不會忘記，我是依舊有着破殘的生活的。</p>
<p>然而，我却有了家……</p>
<h3>懷戀</h3>
<p>— 華之</p>
<p>秋天了，是個懷戀的季節！</p>
<p>早上，披着晨衣，推開了南向的窗，陽光像一條懶狗一樣，疲乏地落到我臥室古舊的褪了漆色的地板上，牠彷彿想找一個歸宿地，牠已經失去了蟬聲高噪時的權威了。</p>
<p>天是高的，雲片困慵地東西飄蕩。晨風迎面吹來，不由得自家打個寒噤，必竟是秋天了，自家也是將步入衰暮之途的中年人了呵！</p>
<p>臥室對面是誰家的花園，有一所朱紅色的敎堂擋住我的視綫，頂上的十字架閃輝着誇耀的燈光。是的，三年來，牠每天矗立在我的面前，牠是傲然的沒有改變的牠的常態：無論是桃色賣弄妖騷的春天，或是牽牛藤低垂着的夏天，在大雪紛飛的冬日，牠還是超然獨立。但是我知道這花園的新主人，曾想把牠拆毀了改建一個荷花池的，因爲牠的舊主人在兩個月之前被一宗交易塗抹了他們光榮的歷史。明年的秋天，想到那敎堂的或許剝奪了宗敎的威嚴，我是不能常住在這里了。</p>
<p>這末着，我沒來由地想起了家。那個家啊，是在遙遠的北方，現在是被滿天黃沙掩蓋着的一個古城。我有一個年高的祖母，她是喜歡在銀色的鬢髮邊簪着一朶鮮紅欲滴的石榴花的，她吿訴過我這理由，說是石榴花盛開是象徵着一象的欣榮的。我家的後園就有着五株石榴，是曾祖手栽的，而他的意思呢，說石榴是多子的，愛好石榴，是希望多子多孫，和祖母的理由是大同小異。但是這五株石榴花牠不懂得主人的善意培植，雖然每年的秋風裏牠開了滿樹的紅花，然而這個家是一天天的衰落下來了。我有個年靑的叔父，在我離家之後，被祖母用拐杖打出了門的，因爲他在賭塲里負了錢，想把有着五株石榴樹的家改姓。說到子孫，我是應該負起曾祖的希望的，但是三十歲的中年，我沒有娶得一門媳婦，老祖母的信裏，她每次是不厭求詳地為我說到我毋家的宗嗣問題，那末，我應該早早要一門妻子吧？我希望就在今天的晚上，做一個輕快的夢：我同着我年輕的妻子回到古鄉去，讓扶着拐杖的祖母，指着盛開的石榴花樹，用一種笑得怕人的聲音說：「今年的石榴花會結得更多的石榴的！」是的，一個已經白髮盈顚的老年人她是想看見更下一代的兒孫吧！</p>
<p>望着那敎堂的十字架，我希望牠像我老祖母一樣健康；更希望牠的新主人讓牠永遠站在那裏作一個可愛的點綴罷牠是那樣傲然地沒有改變過牠的態度，牠是能受得住霜雪嚴寒的冬天的侵凌的啊！</p>
<h3>古城頭的黃昏</h3>
<p>— 華玲</p>
<p>漸漸從熱鬧的市街越過了冷僻的街巷，向北一直跑出了郊外，天色已微微暗下來。在空曠的平野中，一度古城障在目前，城牆上沒有了雉堞，遠望去僅剩下了一幅高大的牆壁．殘缺的城頭上，披上了剛綠起來的亂草，幾個閒人躑躅在上面，在靜穆的黃昏中，使人興起了一點古舊的棖觸。偶然也有兩三個閒人，捧住雀籠，蹲在城頭上等着日落，等着度過一天的命運；也有小孩子在這裏以放風箏來消磨這一個晚天：這一切都是微妙地嘲笑着這古城的。</p>
<p>我們不覺地跑上城頭，希望在城頭上一瞥到古揚州，誰知黃昏的城頭上是另有一種感動的。太陽已落在城外的荒郊上，暮露蓋住了蒼茫的叢林，僅僅天邊染上蛋黃的色素，一種古舊的情調，恰好渲染在古城的輪廓上，是一種諧和的威覺，遠遠的荒郊路上，又傳來一陣細碎的鈴聲，把閒散的眼睛凝眺過去，一行小騾已沒入蒼茫的暮色中了，輕風送來丁……丁……的尾聲，彷彿這是古城特有的聲籟。</p>
<p>向西方遠望去，太陽投射出最後的光綫，郤剛好描出了高高的一些大寺院的尖頂，這一種誘惑，使我們加速了脚步。下城穿過城橋的那邊，沿着河邊向西走去，正好一羣人在一個廟宇門口上了黃包車。探首在門口看看，大家都，一齊驚叫起來：「這就是史可法祠和慕地　　原來「揚州十日」這一幕火辣辣的悲劇，這一個主角就如此蕭條，寂靜地躱在揚州城外迄一個不爲人注意的小地方。祠後當是梅花嶺了。我看祠字這樣零落，一定有相當時期埋沒在荒姻蔓草中，給人們忘記了的。而現在，人們又重新給牠穿上一件榮耀的衣裳；不少工人正在這裏搬運着磚瓦木石，人們又把舊的趣味，重新咀嚼起來哩！</p>
<p>退出祠來，向西追尋這一所大寺宇的所在。在蒼茫中一個高大的牌坊　露在目前，上面刻着「天寗禪寺」；原來揚州的夫寗寺也一樣在無意中得之。在微黑中摸進寺門，立刻覺得博大幽邃，令人如丟在深谷中，心像飄懸着；不知應該附着在那個地方似的。在一條沉寂之階的帝邊，建立着康熙御　亭，稍稍彌補住一個空空的角落。越前殿，又是一個空落的大階，然後　到　雄寶殿？切都是蕭條，沉靜，讓我們橫衝直撞，沒有碰到一個陌生的寺僧。穿過大雄寳殿，直跑向後面去，一間高高的藏經閣，直矗立在後頭；然而，我們已經不能越過一度關閉着的殿門了。一種空洞之感，更逼使我們退出來。回來時，纔覺得管理這空落的大寺的，不是僧人而是烏鴉，滿院是烏鴉的　溺，滿樹上的是一團黑的烏鴉和巢穴，繞遍這空空的院落的，又不是靑罄紅魚的響奏，而是嚓……嚓……的烏鴉聲了。烏鴉反映出這寺宇的荒凉，而烏鴉郤又代替了這寺宇的熱鬧。我不敢跑在院落中，祇好摩娑着長廊的壁上碑文直竄出寺門。這時廊的盡頭，却突然響起了沉重的鐘聲，鐘聲來了，而同行者郤又帶着笑聲跑出來；這來這裏還有鐘，祇可惜鐘聲太寂寞了。</p>
<h3>打尖</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>我們這羣年再的小伕子，對於山，都有着一種共同的愛好。</p>
<p>也正因爲這種愛好，那山水的姿態，投進了眼睛的，就直覺到奇趣的可愛，搖撼了我們的心，迸發着欣幸的快感。</p>
<p>山道上，是並不愁寂寞的，除了我們這一羣以外，空氣也並不喻讓牠安靜了下去，或許把應有的寗靜也蕩起了一層肅殺。</p>
<p>假使你要翻過了一個山頭，大多的時候，總有許多的鈴鐺在嚮亮，並且，隨同着鈴聲吹過來的，是一些馬的蹄子，於是，立卽的給你一個驚覺，使你下意識的想到不好的地方去。這樣，舊小說上的面型，就會不住的湧入了心門，什麽「蹄聲過後，殺出了擊　　　　　，爲首的手執鋼刀，濃眉粗目。」或者是：「很遠的聽到了一陣鈴聲，隱約的雜着呼喊，一直的衝奔而來」，這一類的事蹟，都會在腦海里轉圈子，雖則那上而所說的事蹟，都在　渺得不可捉摸，但，由現在的實際情形看來，是會連想發生的。</p>
<p>其實，當鈴聲和蹄子出現的時候，沒有彪形大漢，也沒有濃眉粗目，只不過幾隻驢子　着一些應用的貨物蹌踉的走着，後面跟着的是飽經風雨侵襲下的趕夫。大概是「責任」卸除了，在臉上掛上了輕快的喜悅，說着，紅桃牌的烟捲，吊在嘴唇邊，烟，裊裊地升起，結成了一團雲圈。</p>
<p>驢停住了，洩着靑黃色的屎，屎上，冒了熱的氣。</p>
<p>——到那吃早飯？</p>
<p>——　　　吧，牽了繩子，他們過</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>去了。</p>
<p>人，就是這樣的沒有出息，感應力特別的强盛，一聽到人家說吃早飯，自己的肚裏，立卽的就有點鬧亂，彷彿能馬上吃進點東西才好，算計一下，早晨吃過東西以後，到現在不過才兩三個鐘頭，爲什麽要這樣呢？我不懂。</p>
<p>——打尖吧，我提議。</p>
<p>伕頭沒有反對，也許他心裏要想，何必如此的怱忙呢？但，他不敢說，埋藏在肚子裏，由透露的遲疑的神情，是可以看出來的。</p>
<p>——在前面的楊家街吧！</p>
<p>决定了，我們走着，無言的，在每個人的心底，藏了自我的思緒。</p>
<p>楊家街，是沒有多大的，那一條直的路，有點像S形，在搭了茅棚的房子面前，卸掉了行裝，那長的木凳上，迅速的被我們全佔據了。</p>
<p>——盛碗水飯，還有豆腐花。</p>
<p>伕子，伙伴，都分開來，各自的，顧慮到自己的食物。老黃，鐵，和我是向在一桌上的，爲了吃得多的緣故，老板的腿是不曾停歇過的。</p>
<p>——再來三百錢的紅薯。</p>
<p>——賣光啦，先生。老板的女兒走過來，笑着：再盛碗豆腐花吧？</p>
<p>女兒的年紀，約模女二十的左右，爲了供養的不足，臉上的菜靑色是遮不住的，但，那活躍的力量總是可愛的。</p>
<p>——燒飯的大蛆，炒兩個蛋行麽？老黃接着說。</p>
<p>——不到趕市，這裏是沒有蛋買的。她又笑了。</p>
<p>——旁的呢？你去找？買來我炒，</p>
<p>她帶着錢走出去，在這個桌子上留下來的，是沉寂的凄凉。</p>
<p>——走，不早嘍！頭喊過來，催着。</p>
<p>披上行裝，開始的，我們又跨上了行程。看看老黃，他苦了臉——</p>
<p>——大姐怎的再不來了呢？他的心裏也許要這樣的想。</p>

<h3>End of the Political Reorganization Committee: Wang Kemin Convenes Meeting of All Departments to Decide to Cease Operations Today, President Wang Explains Reasons for Abolition</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Political Reorganization Committee has been ordered to be abolished. The acting chairman of the committee, Wang Kemin, convened a final meeting this morning at 9:00 AM at the committee's building, with Secretary-General Yu Jiaji and the heads of all departments, to discuss the winding-up matters. As a result, it was decided that all operations would cease by the 31st of this month, and the committee would be officially abolished from the 1st of next month. All expenses will be settled by tomorrow. The Third Department has already completed its winding-up, and the First and Second Departments are rushing to complete all procedures and are expected to finish by tomorrow. The meeting adjourned at around 11:00 AM. It is said that the central government has great confidence in Wang and will continue to rely on him for political affairs in North China. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) This reporter visited Wang Kemin this morning and inquired about everything. He replied as follows: (Question) When will the winding-up of the Political Reorganization Committee be completed? Is it true that the chairman will go to Nanjing again at the beginning of next month? (Answer) This committee is scheduled to complete its winding-up within a week. Before completion, I will still reside at the committee to supervise the process. Whether I will go to Nanjing next month is undecided. (Question) It is rumored that after the Political Reorganization Committee is abolished, there will be a replacement organization, namely the North China Economic Committee. When will it be established? Will it still be chaired and organized by the chairman? What will be the content? (Answer) There is no Economic Committee. There is only an Economic Association recently organized by the Chamber of Commerce, the Banking Association, and well-known economists, which has nothing to do with the Political Reorganization Committee. (Question) Will the former capital Cultural Relics Reorganization Committee, affiliated with the Political Reorganization Committee, still exist? Has the North China Construction Discussion Committee ended? (Answer) The former capital Cultural Relics Reorganization Committee should still exist. As for which department it will be transferred to, we are now asking the government for instructions. The Construction Discussion Committee will end at the same time. (Question) Is it true that the Hebei Provincial Government will move to Beiping? (Answer) I haven't heard of that. (Question) It is rumored that the Mayor of Beiping, Yuan Liang, will be transferred to be the Vice Minister of Interior. Has a successor been internally decided? (Answer) I also haven't heard of it. (Question) What is the organizational content of the North China Economic Association? When will it be officially announced? (Answer) It was initiated by merchants and is now being prepared by the Chamber of Commerce and the Banking Association. (Question) How much will the winding-up expenses of the Political Reorganization Committee cost in total? Has it been allocated? How will the staff be taken care of? (Answer) When in Nanjing, President Wang mentioned paying the September salaries, but there has been no official announcement yet. How the staff will be taken care of is also being discussed, but there is probably little hope. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Political Reorganization Committee members Wang Yitang, accompanied by Cao Rulin and Tang Yulin, took a car to Beiping early on the 30th to meet with Wang Kemin for negotiations. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Cao Rulin arrived in Beiping from Tianjin this morning and visited Shang Zhen to discuss important official matters. It is rumored that Shang has official duties to attend to in Tianjin and plans to visit Tianjin in the next few days. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang talked to reporters from the Central News Agency on the 30th about the reasons for abolishing the Beiping Political Reorganization Committee, saying that in April of the 22nd year [1933], the Beiping Political Affairs Branch was reorganized into the Resident Beiping Political Affairs Reorganization Committee, with Mr. Huang Yingbai as the chairman. At that time, due to the unfavorable war situation at various passes of the Great Wall, Beiping and Tianjin were in imminent danger, and the establishment was delayed. In mid-May, Chairman Huang resolutely went north and, together with Mr. He Jingzhi, the acting chairman of the Beiping Military Branch, discussed ways to reverse the situation. Under the trust of the central government, the Tanggu Truce was established with the Kwantung Army at the end of May of that year, so that the war could be stopped. The urgent task at that time was the reorganization of the war zone, because although the Japanese soldiers had withdrawn, all administrative and transportation rights in the war zone were still in the hands of the Kwantung Army. It took a lot of trouble to recover these rights. During that time, the Chahar Incident and the Fang Ji Incident occurred one after another, and there were many interruptions along the way. Chairman Huang stood firm in this fragmented and disjointed situation and repeatedly thought of resigning, but both Chairman Chiang and I did our best to comfort and retain him. In January of this year, he repeated his previous request in Nanjing. Unexpectedly, a major negotiation occurred in Tianjin in May and June, which was brought to a conclusion with the support of Acting Chairman He. Now, the situation has changed greatly. This time, Chairman Chiang came to Nanjing and discussed with me and Chairman Huang, Acting Chairman He, and others several times, believing that the administrative organization in the north should be simplified as much as possible. The Resident Beiping Political Affairs Committee, which was deemed necessary in the past environment, is now no longer necessary to be set up. It was decided to telegraph Acting Chairman Wang Shulu to come to Nanjing for a face-to-face discussion on the winding-up measures, so as to make proper arrangements. The qualifications of the service personnel of the committee have also been reviewed in advance, so as not to betray several years of hard work. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The North China Economic Association is jointly organized by the Beiping-Tianjin Banking Association, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Municipal Government. It held its first meeting on the 23rd to discuss organizational measures and has been actively preparing for its establishment, which is expected to be officially established within a week. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>President Wang and Yu Youren Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Premier of the Executive Yuan Wang Jingwei took the night express train to Shanghai tonight. Those traveling with him include Yu Youren, Chu Minyi, Liu Ruiheng, Zeng Zhongming, and Zou Lin. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Because his old illness has not been completely cured, Premier Wang took the night train to Shanghai on the 30th to ask Dr. Noel to re-examine him and change his medication. He will return to Nanjing on the night train on the 31st. Wang originally planned to take advantage of the Sunday holiday to go to Shanghai on the night train on the 31st, but because Sunday is the funeral date for martyr Liao Zhongkai, he went ahead of schedule. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang took the night train to Shanghai on the 30th to examine his old illness. Chu Minyi and Zeng Zhongming accompanied him. Also, Yu Youren and Ju Zheng also went to Shanghai on the night of the 30th. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Cables that Bandit Suppression is Going Smoothly; Foreign Reports Are Purely Fabricated</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Because foreign newspapers in Shanghai carried rumors from Tianjin about unfavorable military news in Sichuan, this reporter went to the station to inquire with Wang. According to President Wang, he and Chairman Chiang exchange telegrams daily. This afternoon at 3:40 PM, he received a telegram from Chairman Chiang sent at 2:40 PM on the same day, stating that the bandit suppression military operations are going smoothly and discussing other political affairs. This proves that the rumors in foreign newspapers are purely fabricated. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Minister of Military Affairs He received a telegram from Chairman Chiang at noon on the 30th, stating that the recent floods in the Yangtze River and the Yellow River are severe, especially the upper reaches of the Yellow River, and it is urgent to order the troops stationed in various places to assist the local officials and people and flood prevention and disaster relief organizations in carrying out work, and to try to save them from the disaster. He immediately forwarded the order to the troops in various places to comply. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang is Concerned about Wounded and Sick Officers and Soldiers in Bandit Suppression</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang ordered his adjutants and the staff of the General Staff to form a comfort group to go to various military hospitals to comfort the wounded and sick officers and soldiers who were suppressing bandits, and to provide them with daily necessities as appropriate. The group is now working actively, distributing comfort to military hospitals near Chengdu, Chongqing and Wanxian, and will soon go to Guanxian, Mianyang, Guanghan and other places.

<h3>Gu Weijun Cancels Attendance at the League of Nations Assembly</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After Ambassador to France Gu Weijun canceled his attendance at the League of Nations Assembly, it was rumored that one of the three ambassadors, Hu Shize, Luo Zongyi, or Jin Wensi, would be chosen as his successor. According to diplomatic sources, it has not yet been determined whether to appoint a replacement. Now, because Gu has not yet settled the affairs in Nanjing, he will visit President Wang again for instructions and then go to Shanghai. As for the date of his departure for France, it will be around mid-October. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Gu Weijun is scheduled to go to Shanghai in a day or two. Ju Zheng and He Yingqin visited Gu successively on the morning of the 30th and had a long conversation. According to Gu, he told reporters from the Central News Agency that he is waiting for the completion of the procedures for China and France to mutually elevate their diplomatic missions, and that President Wang has discussed many diplomatic issues with him. Therefore, he will postpone his departure abroad for a month or two. Regarding the elevation of the Sino-French diplomatic missions, after the French Parliament passes it on October 6 and both parties agree on the candidates, they can mutually send ambassadors. I will not be able to attend this session of the League of Nations Assembly. The government will not send another representative. Because each country has only one representative who can speak at the League of Nations Assembly and the Executive Yuan Council, and has only one vote. Other committees can be handled by the three or four ministers stationed in other European countries as assistant representatives, so there is no great impact. China's bid for a permanent seat on the League of Nations Council has been negotiated by Ambassador Guo with various countries and there is considerable hope. The dispute between Italy and Abyssinia is becoming increasingly tense and seems difficult to avoid conflict. If the war is prolonged and the scope is expanded, the European situation and world peace are extremely worrying. Whether the League of Nations will intervene to impose sanctions on this matter will be decided after the Executive Yuan Council. Regarding the future of Sino-Japanese diplomacy, it is difficult to say for sure. There are various reasons for both China and Japan to be friendly and cooperative, but this must be built on the basis of equality. Since the September 18th Incident, China has made concessions repeatedly, reaching a serious limit. It is hoped that the Japanese authorities will broaden their horizons and take steps that are beneficial to both parties. China has always valued peace and has no imperialist ideas. China's construction and progress will also be beneficial to Japan's commercial economy, etc. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Yellow River in Shaanxi Rises Again</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a report on the 30th, the Economic Commission stated that the Yellow River in Shanzhou rose another five inches and one point, with the water level reaching 195.25 meters and the flow increasing by 11,250 cubic meters per second. The upstream and downstream of Shandong also rose sharply, and the situation is even more dangerous. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Economic Commission Urges Shandong to Divert the Flow; Han Fuju Claims Funds Are Insufficient; The Executive Yuan Orders Zhang Lianjia to Redeem Himself Through Merit</h3>
<p>(Jinan) On the 29th, the Economic Commission telegraphed Han Fuju, stating that the Yellow River is rising again. If the breaches are not blocked, not only will southern Shandong be flooded, but the Jinpu Railway in northern Jiangsu will also be cut off. It is imperative to divert the flow into the main river as decided by the Yellow River Flood Prevention Conference. Han replied that diverting a river would require 1.5 million yuan. Since the breach, the central government has only allocated 260,000 yuan for construction, which is not enough to purchase stone and straw for emergency rescue. Please allocate funds quickly. The Executive Yuan ordered the Provincial Government to thoroughly investigate and severely punish Zhang Shujia, the director of the River Affairs Bureau, for neglecting the dike defense. All flood prevention and breach blocking matters should still be the responsibility of the director, to redeem himself through merit. The breach blocking meeting estimated that 16,000 cubic feet of stone would be needed to block the breach and planned to transport it in four months, requiring 50 douzi vehicles. It also ordered the Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways to requisition 900 large vehicles along the line and 550 boats, requesting Hebei and Henan to each prepare 150 boats and Shandong to prepare 250 boats, all to be requisitioned by September 5 for use.

<h3>The Unfolding New Situation in North China</h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>Just as Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan resumed office, he decided to appoint Song Zheyuan as the commander of the Beiping-Tianjin Garrison. The day before yesterday, the National Government officially ordered the abolition of the Beiping Political Reorganization Committee and instructed Wang Kemin to expedite the winding-up process. Although the two events each have their own significance, they are based on the same fundamental principle. From this, we can easily infer that the government's diplomatic strategy has a concrete direction, and these two events are a manifestation of its established policy. The unfolding of a new situation in North China is something that most people expect, and we are eager to watch and see how it will develop.</p>
<p>Over the past year, the situation in North China has been unstable and fraught with warnings. The authorities have found it difficult to cope with, and national affairs have become increasingly precarious. Since the Hebei Incident occurred, the situation has suddenly deteriorated, and North China has once again been enveloped in the shadow of war, almost inevitably leading to a break. Our authorities have consistently adopted an attitude of tolerance to seek appropriate solutions, preventing the situation from escalating and restoring calm. However, some people who do not understand have repeatedly criticized. When President Wang resigned due to illness, rumors spread like wildfire. Not only were there bizarre rumors internationally, but even domestic people could not avoid being plagued by doubts. Fortunately, the central government unanimously decided to retain Wang, and Chiang and Wang met several times beforehand to reach a consensus. Therefore, as soon as Wang resumed office, he resolutely implemented the planned strategies, changing the previous indecisive attitude to shift the attention of the people and to demonstrate decisiveness. The replacement of Song Zheyuan, who left office due to the Jicha Incident, and the reinstatement of him as the commander of the Beiping-Tianjin Garrison, shows that a considerable understanding must have been reached in fact. The sudden abolition of the Political Reorganization Committee, which was in charge of political affairs in North China, shows that it is a premeditated plan to stabilize the overall future situation. We believe that the situation in North China is improving, and at least in the near future, it should not cause unexpected disputes again.</p>
<p>We do not dare to rejoice in temporary peace and forget the overall welfare of the country. The fact is that today, we are beset by internal and external troubles, and disasters are constantly occurring. Just like a hundred-holed and thousand-pierced object, there is no way to start mending it. The people have suffered so much exploitation that they can no longer bear the disaster of destruction. Knowing that seeking temporary peace is not a good plan, we also want to catch our breath a little. It is also gratifying that the government has established a clear direction and can avoid hesitation in its actions. However, there is still something we cannot help but say: although the military threat in North China can be temporarily avoided in the future, economic cooperation is still a problem. Whether the organization of the China Development Company has other implications, and whether the so-called industrial development can conform to the principle of equality, should be exchanged and discussed by the authorities of both parties to formulate appropriate countermeasures. As for the North China Economic Committee being promoted in Beiping and the East Asia Economic Association being organized by Tianjin gentry, their positions and backgrounds should be thoroughly investigated and closely monitored. We cannot treat them lightly simply because they are local actions.</p>
<h3>Plague in Longyan Becomes More Severe</h3>
<p>(Xiamen) The plague in Longyan was originally bubonic, which was effectively contained. On the 27th, two patients with pneumonic plague were suddenly discovered, and both died within a few hours. The Department of Health sent specialist Yang Yongnian and Chen Yifeng, a Japanese political affairs specialist from the Seventh District, to the Xiamen Seaport Quarantine Station on the 19th to quickly send 100 tubes of plague bacteria for application. The pneumonic plague, or "pneumonic pestis," occurred in the Northeast provinces during the late Qing Dynasty and is more severe than bubonic plague. The Longyan County Government has issued a notice stating that anyone with coughs, chills, fever, or hemoptysis should report immediately and be sent to the hospital for isolation. Concealment or deliberate delay will result in arrest and severe punishment for the patient's family. Because this disease spreads extremely quickly, patients almost always die.

<h3>Wang Shuchang Sends Personnel to Tianjin to Welcome Song; He Yingqin Urges Wang to Go to Nanjing Early to Take Up Garrison Duties; Garrison Camp Transferred to Liu Duoquan's Command</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Wang Shuchang, the commander of the Beiping-Tianjin Garrison, sent Yao Donghan, the director of his adjutant's office, to Tianjin this morning with a personal letter to pay his respects to Song Zheyuan, the incoming commander of the Beiping-Tianjin Garrison, and welcome Song to take office in Beiping as soon as possible. Yao has returned to Beiping this afternoon with Song's reply, which roughly stated that he was very grateful for the welcome from Wang's representative and would go to Beiping to take office around the 15th of next month after finishing matters in Tianjin. He Yingqin sent a telegram to Wang Shuchang yesterday, expressing his condolences to Wang and hoping that Wang would go to Nanjing as soon as possible to take up the post of Vice President of the Military Advisory Council. The entire garrison camp has been transferred back to the command and control of Liu Duoquan's 105th Division. After receiving the telegram, Wang is in the process of handling the transfer and will complete it soon, awaiting handover. Qin Dechun and Xiao Zhenying went to Tianjin this afternoon at Song's invitation and will return to Beiping in two or three days. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Yin Rugeng Visits Sakai to Discuss Joint Suppression of Bandits in the War Zone; Zunhua Imposes Martial Law and Conscripts Strong Men for Defense; Xinglong County Government Cables Specialist Office for Emergency Help; Li Laobao's Band Surrounded in Qian'an</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) On the afternoon of the 30th, Yin Rugeng arrived in Tianjin from Tangshan and went to the Haiguang Temple Barracks to visit Sakai, the staff officer of the Japanese Garrison, to discuss the joint Sino-Japanese suppression of bandits along the Great Wall. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A large band of bandits of more than 600 people was discovered north of Zunhua. They sneaked in through Shaojingguan on the 28th and occupied areas such as Yejiyu and Zhengjiagou. Zunhua immediately imposed martial law, and the militia went to meet them. The bandits fled to Hongshankou. The county government specially conscripted strong men from various villages to set up defenses in places such as the Toudaochengzi Qiukeyu Hougezai. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) About 2,400 to 2,500 soldiers of the pseudo-North China Army were discovered in the Jun and Tangdao Rivers of Zunhua. It is rumored that Liu Guitang and Bai Jianwu are among them and appear to be advancing towards Malan Town. The Xinglong County Government telegraphed the Ji Mi District Specialist Office on the 28th for emergency help. About 300 bandits are entrenched in the Daoliushui of Xinglong and intend to sneak in. Zhang Yantian, the captain of the Second Security Brigade, led his troops to Malanguan on the 29th for defense. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Li Laobao's bandits suffered heavy losses in the encirclement and suppression by the Japanese puppet troops outside the pass. The remnants of 400 people sneaked in again from Taohuakou on the night of the 27th and entrenched themselves in Maoshan, thirty-eight li west of Santunying in Qian'an. The First and Second Security Brigades each sent a company to cooperate with the militia to suppress them on the 28th and have surrounded the bandits, engaged in fierce fighting. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to news from Qian'an, Li Laobao's bandits retreated from Hongshankou and, due to pressure from the Japanese army, sneaked in from Taohuakou on the 27th and entrenched themselves in Maoshan, thirty-eight li west of Santunying, with a total of more than 400 bandits. After receiving the report, the headquarters of the First and Second Security Brigades immediately dispatched a company of police each and joined the militia of Lulong and Qian'an to suppress the bandits. They surrounded the bandits and made contact with them six or seven times. They are still surrounding them. Banditry is rampant in Yutian, with four kidnapping cases occurring in one day.

<h3>Bandit Leader Discovered in Renxian is a Normal School Graduate</h3>
<p>(Beiping) People from Shunde said that more than 1,000 bandits were discovered in places such as Rentun, Liuzhuang, and Yingcun in Renxian, more than ten li away from Shunde. The leaders are Liu Wenzhong and Liu Zhenhe, both graduates of normal schools. The banner of the bandits is marked with the "Pseudo-Red Army Guerrilla Team." The weapons used include pistols, rifles, carbines, and broadswords. The clothing is yellow, gray, and blue. The bandits who are unarmed are called "Cloth Bag Teams." Wherever they go, they kidnap, burn, and loot, which is very miserable. They also rob the local wealthy people of their belongings and money and distribute them to the poor. The 29th Division stationed there has sent a battalion of soldiers to patrol and suppress them in various ways. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Consul in Tianjin Protests Robbery Incident</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) After receiving a protest from the Japanese Consul in Tianjin regarding the robbery incident on the Beining Railway, the Beining Railway Bureau telegraphed the contents to the Ministry of Railways for verification and prepared a memorial to be sent to the Ministry in the next few days. Due to the nature of its authority, the Bureau was unable to make a direct reply. It is reported that the bandits involved in the robbery are still at large after many investigations. Regarding railway security, it has now been decided to add an armed car with light machine guns to enhance the bandit prevention capabilities. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Iron Works Purchases Iron Ore from Hubei</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Taking advantage of the improved Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, an agreement has been reached between the Japanese Iron Works and the iron ore mines in Xiangbishan, Hubei Province, China, which have been banned from export since the Manchurian Incident, to purchase 150,000 tons of ore this year. Yesterday, the Matsuura Maru departed from Xiangbishan with 4,900 tons of iron ore, heading for Yahata. The ore grade is 60% iron.

<h3>The Situation in East Africa is Increasingly Tense, Europe is in a Precarious State; The Mediterranean Sea Becomes the Center of Military Action; Britain Actively Reinforces Defenses in Malta; Submarine Fleet Concentrates on the South Coast to Standby</h3>
<p>The Mediterranean Sea has become the center of military operations today, second only to the Italian-Ethiopian border in East Africa. It is widely rumored that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini intends to occupy Albania with troops to protect the borders of neighboring Little Entente countries. This news, coupled with the British fleet's deployment to the Suez Canal, makes the European situation even more precarious. According to sources in Athens, Italy has recently secretly transported a large number of munitions and many military officers to the Albanian coast. (National Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>(London) The British Mediterranean fleet is actively being deployed from Malta today. It is said to be a routine cruise, but in reality, this is the largest naval deployment since the precarious situation in Italy and Albania. Among them, the battleships "Revenge" and "Valiant", and the cruisers "London", "Devonshire", and "Shropshire", and the repair ship "Resource" have all sailed to Alexandria. The battleship "Resolution" and the cruiser "Emerald" have sailed to Port Said. The cruisers "Arethusa", "Delhi", and "Curlew", as well as the sloop "Godolphin", have sailed to Haifa. (National Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>Malta is currently engaged in preventing possible aerial gas bomb attacks. The police have conducted gas defense drills and recruited a police reserve force to strengthen their capabilities. Dockworkers and engineers are now very active. The port defenses are more sophisticated than during the European War and are nearing completion. The system of requiring foreigners to obtain permits from the police station before landing is now being reinstated. (Special Telegram from the North-China Daily News, 29th)</p>
<p>Portsmouth: Malta Island is Britain's naval base in the Mediterranean. It is currently busy transporting anti-aircraft guns there. At the same time, naval mobilizations are also progressing in that direction, indicating that the British naval activity in the Mediterranean has exceeded the normal level. (National Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>(Paris) A reporter dispatched by Le Matin to Italy to observe the army's large-scale maneuvers recently stated that the Italian government has ordered 60 submarines to prepare everything at the Augusta naval base in southern Sicily and has ordered the air force to concentrate in that province. The port of Augusta is quite close to the British-owned Malta Island in the Mediterranean. British authorities recently sent warships to the island. The general public believes that this move by the Italian government is directed at Britain. (Agence Havas Telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>(Rome) It is rumored that the government has ordered 60 submarines to prepare everything at the Augusta naval base in Sicily. Local newspapers, due to Italian laws prohibiting the publication of military news, have neither confirmed nor denied this. However, well-informed sources believe that if the government were to mobilize the submarine fleet due to the British aircraft carrier Glorious and other warships sailing to Malta, it could do so openly without concealment. Furthermore, when the cabinet met in Bolzano yesterday, it was rumored that the Italian government, due to British warships having sailed to Aden, intended to send a portion of its fleet to the Suez Canal to counter them. However, after the cabinet meeting concluded, the authorities issued a communique expressing a willingness to compromise with Britain, which contradicted the rumors. Therefore, even if the Italian government were to order its army, navy, and air force to prepare everything, it would only be for dealing with Abyssinia and would have no other intentions. (Agence Havas Telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>(London) Today, French and German newspapers all stated that the situation between Italy and Albania has become more precarious after the Italian cabinet held a special meeting in Bolzano. The opinion of the French authorities can be discerned from the commentary in Le Temps, which stated that the Italian government is determined to pursue its established policy, regardless of the decisions of the League of Nations Administrative Council on September 4th. This is now even more evident. According to German newspapers, the resolutions of Bolzano prove that Italy is determined to achieve its goals without the consent of the League of Nations or Britain, and may even resist both parties. However, the Rome Tribuna stated that Italy's policy does not directly or indirectly endanger British interests. (Reuters Telegram, 29th)</p>
<h3>Britain Mobilizes Diplomatic and Military Power to Cope with Future Serious Events; Mediterranean Fleet is Busy with Mobilization; External Study to Formulate Measures</h3>
<p>(London) Italy's provocative actions towards the world have led Britain to mobilize its army, navy, and diplomatic power to cope with serious events, namely, those warned against by Mussolini. Legal experts outside the British government are currently studying the content of the U.S. Neutrality Act signed by President Roosevelt to prepare recommendations regarding the abolition of the embargo on munitions and actions to impose sanctions on Italy in the event of war. It is not entirely clear whether the U.S. Neutrality Act also prohibits cotton, copper, steel, and chemicals. If the League of Nations and Britain impose sanctions on the aggressor, the sanctions will inevitably be ineffective if the United States does not prohibit these items. Military activity in Portsmouth is currently very intense. Anti-aircraft guns are being loaded onto the Benledi, and it is rumored that the Benledi has received secret orders to sail to Malta Island. Air Force officers and soldiers stationed at the Lee-on-the-Solent naval base have also been ordered to stand by today. (National News Agency Telegram, 30th)</p>
<h3>Italian Cabinet Decision; No Reaction in Paris; Unwilling to Participate in Any Sanctions Against Italy</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Italian cabinet's resolutions at the Bolzano meeting have not caused a special reaction from the French newspapers. According to most people's opinions, France is caught between two major powers. Therefore, before Britain clarifies its path at Geneva, it cannot concretely express its attitude towards the Italian-Ethiopian issue. Le Volf claims a reliable source saying Sir Eden arriving in Geneva will soon lobby most member countries behind the scenes to support financial and economic sanctions, but Eden will abandon any coercive military plans, such as blockade plans. Le Journal claims the French prime minister has clearly expressed at a recent cabinet meeting that France is unwilling to participate in any plans to sanction Italy. (National Telegram, 29th)</p>
<h3>Italian-Ethiopian War Inevitable; Likelihood of Outbreak is Ninety-Nine to One; British Foreign Secretary Stays in London to Observe the Development of the Situation</h3>
<p>(London) According to Exchange Telegraph, today's Athens telegram stated that garrison islands are being fortified in order to blockade the Adriatic Sea in the event of war. Lloyd's Insurance Company announced that the possibility of an Italian-Ethiopian war breaking out is 99 to 1, and the possibility of an outbreak within a month is 4 to 1. Foreign Secretary Hoare has canceled his plans to travel to Aix-les-Bains, France, in order to observe the changes in the Italian-Ethiopian situation in London. Prime Minister Baldwin is currently vacationing in Aix and will return to London on September 4th. (National Telegram, 29th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Faces Difficulties in Handling the Italian-Ethiopian Dispute; Will it Follow the Precedent of the Sino-Japanese Case and Regard Delay as the Best Policy?</h3>
<p>(Paris) Renowned reporter Pertinax recently published an article in Le Petit Parisien, predicting the procedures that the League of Nations Administrative Council may take when discussing the Italian-Ethiopian dispute on September 4th. It is said that "During the Administrative Council meeting, the British representative will submit a report. The impact of this report on Italy and other member states of the Administrative Council will largely depend on its wording and manner of presentation." Once the British report is submitted, the Italian representative will officially read out the documents accusing Ethiopia. The Administrative Council will consider it necessary to review each of the accusations and will invoke Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant to conduct an investigation in order to draft a report. Because the procedures outlined in this article are very complicated, they cannot be completed in a short period of time. The Italian-Ethiopian dispute can thus be delayed, and the talks that were interrupted halfway through the Paris Conference can continue to be held by Britain, France, Italy, and Ethiopia. The Administrative Council may even follow the precedent of the Manchurian dispute, appointing a commission to conduct an on-site investigation in Ethiopia in order to submit a report. "This delaying tactic is commonly used by the League of Nations to handle thorny issues, but whether the member states of the current Administrative Council will obey orders is still uncertain. Because Britain advocates strict adherence to the Covenant, there will be no shortage of supporters in the Administrative Council. The Chairman of the Administrative Council, namely the Argentine representative Quenaz, as well as the representatives of Mexico and Chile, will definitely support the British proposal." Other countries such as Spain, Portugal, and Denmark will also advocate this, but the attitude of other member states is still difficult to predict, and there may be entanglements during the Administrative Council meeting, so it is not necessarily certain what kind of measures will be decided.

<h3>Cecil Criticizes Italian Actions</h3>
<p>(London) Renowned international peace activist and League of Nations advocate Viscount Cecil told a reporter from the Associated Press today that Italy's aggression against Ethiopia, regardless of the pretext, will ultimately drag civilized nations into the vortex of war. All civilized countries must find ways to prevent the Italian-Ethiopian war. Cecil also strongly advocated the League of Nations' sanctions against Italy. Assuming that powerful countries can bully the weak with their military force without any constraints, how can small countries have faith in so-called "civilization"? (National Telegram, 29th)</p>
<h3>Italy Deploys National Forces to Cope with East African War; Youths Over Seventeen Must Receive Military Training; European Laborers Prepare for Anti-Italian General Strike</h3>
<p>(London) According to sources in Rome, the Italian government has canceled soldiers' leave and intends to deploy all its forces to cope with the war. Three more troop transports carrying 6,000 Blackshirts will depart for East Africa today and tomorrow. Another group will depart on September 1st. It is rumored that British and European labor leaders are currently planning to take joint action, declare a general strike across Europe, and implement a boycott to hinder Italy's war operations. (Special Telegram from the North-China Daily News, 28th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Previously, all youths of ten years old were subject to compulsory military service. Speaker Balella, with the approval of the competent authorities, has now issued an instruction stipulating that youths aged seventeen to twenty must also receive military training and be subject to military service obligations. The number of volunteers heading to East Africa has recently increased significantly, but there are no explicit regulations regarding volunteers under the age of twenty. Among the 100,000 men in the vanguard, 25,000 will receive firearms and sufficient military training. Therefore, they can be used to stay in Europe or go to East Africa, depending on the development of the situation. (National Telegram, 30th)</p>
<h3>Balbo Returns Home to Meet with Italian Prime Minister; Reports on His Visit to Paris</h3>
<p>(Paris) Italian Air Force General Balbo arrived here on the 26th. It is said that he was investigating the business conditions of the Rome-Paris airline route in a private capacity. According to Le Paris Soir, the general has already returned to Bolzano, Italy, and was received by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. Well-informed sources believe that when the general was in Paris, he held talks with the French authorities on commercial aspects of the Italian-Ethiopian dispute. His trip to Bolzano was to report on the progress of this trip to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. (Agence Havas Telegram, 30th)</p>
<h3>Italy to Implement New Economic Policy; Industrial Stocks Plunge as a Result</h3>

Fiat's stock fell 105 pounds, rayon factories fell 91 pounds, tin and metal factories fell 26 pounds, and Edison Electric Company fell 76 pounds. It is rumored that one of the government's new economic plans, aimed at restricting imports, stipulates that cars produced in 1937 or later must use propulsion other than petroleum or other imported liquids.

<h3>Ethiopia Prepares for Defense Day and Night; National Mobilization Can Reach 500,000 People; Anti-Gas Mask Drill to be Held in Addis Ababa</h3>
<p>(London) Italy is still continuously transporting troops to East Africa, while Ethiopia is preparing for defense day and night.

<h3>Coping with Extraordinary Times - Japan Vigorously Seeks to Strengthen National Defense - The Army's Five-Year Plan Must Be Realized, Army Minister Hayashi Reveals Intention to Resign to Okada</h3>

<h3>The Italy-Abyssinia Case Will Likely Affect the World Naval Conference</h3>
<p>(London) According to diplomatic sources tonight, the negotiations on the Naval Conference must wait for the results of the League of Nations Council's handling of the Italy-Abyssinia dispute on September 4 before any decisions can be made. If the Italy-Abyssinia dispute is not resolved, then any talks will be fruitless. If a dispute arises between Italy and the League of Nations, then the naval power of various countries in the Mediterranean Sea will need to be reconsidered. Therefore, diplomatic sources believe that it is not appropriate to set any plans for the date of the future naval conference stipulated by the Washington Naval Treaty. Furthermore, England previously sent a note to the Japanese government proposing to continue holding preliminary naval talks. The authorities are keeping silent on the contents of Japan's reply. However, it is generally speculated that Japan's recognition of the principle of maximum total tonnage limits is a prerequisite for participating in any naval talks. All the evidence proves this to be credible. (Note: During the London Naval Talks last year, the Japanese delegates advocated abolishing naval ratio limits and stipulating a common maximum limit for naval total tonnage to realize equal rights in naval armaments.)

<h3>A Record of the Inspection of the Disaster Situation on the Rivers</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Geng Ya</p>
<p>From Luoyang to Kaifeng</p>
<p>Luoyang is a commercial center in Henan, and it was where King Wu of Zhou established his capital after conquering the Shang dynasty. During the Warring States period, it belonged to Han and was first named Guyang. Emperor Guangwu of the Eastern Han Dynasty also made it his capital. The Wei and Jin dynasties changed Luoyang to Luoyang, making it one of China's five ancient capitals. During the Shanghai war, it was once considered as a temporary capital, and the address of the National Government still exists there. The city walls are close to the Luo River, and the ground is slightly higher than the riverbed. The streets of the South Gate are directly equal to the bottom of the river, and the East Gate is also threatened by the Chan River. A few years ago, the flood submerged the large stone bridge outside the East Gate and poured into the East Street, reaching a depth of three to four feet. This autumn, the Yi and Luo Rivers experienced heavy floods, but fortunately, the city gates were not affected, while the surrounding villages were already affected by the disaster. According to investigations, the affected area is 229 square li, with 52,881 acres of land submerged and 433,350 yuan in losses. 230 houses were flooded and collapsed, and 55,400 people are awaiting disaster relief. When the reporter traveled west and arrived in Luoyang, I learned that the disaster areas are in districts four, five, and six, along the Yi and Luo Rivers. I then went to inspect. Two to three li south of the city, I reached the banks of the Luo River. The source of the Luo River is in the Mengling Mountains of Luonan County, Shaanxi. It flows southeast into Henan Province, passing through Lushi, Yongning, Yiyang, and the three counties. It enters the Yanshi border at the southeast corner of Luoyang, receiving the Jian and Er rivers. The flow rate is prone to sudden increases, carrying mud and sand, which gradually settles and raises the riverbed downstream, causing damage similar to the main stream of the Yellow River. The entire territory of Yanshi and Gongxian is submerged, which is exactly the problem of an overly high riverbed. Luoyang's terrain is flat, but not low-lying, and the embankments around the city are high and strong. When the Luo River rises, although there has been some slight erosion and overflow, after the flood crest passes, it flows back into the main channel, and there is no danger of vast stagnation. Therefore, from the southern suburbs to Longmen, that is, from the Luo River basin to the Yi River basin, the crops along the disaster-stricken areas, such as sorghum, millet, and corn, have been washed by the flood, and even lie prostrate on the ground. However, since the water has not been stagnant for long, it is easy to support them and replant. This is not comparable to a major famine.</p>
<p>The Yi River originates in the Dongtai'er Mountain in Lushi County, passing through Songxian and Yiyang counties, entering the territory, exiting north from Yique and entering Yanshi to the east. The nature of the water and the disaster situation are similar to the Luo River. Yique is 25 li southwest of the city, where two cliffs face each other like a gate. The east is Xiangshan, and the west is Longmen. The Yi River flows in the middle, and it was dredged by Dayu, hence the name Yique. It also has the names Quese, Quekou, Zhongshan, and other names. The Longmen cliffs are a hundred zhang high, and the walls are covered with carved stone Buddhas, numbering in the millions, solemn and magnificent, comparable to Datong and Dunhuang. The famous "Twenty Articles of Longmen" are one of the thousands of steles. The mountain caves are exquisite, and the stream water gushes everywhere. There is a famous "Gong and Drum Spring", where listening from above the spring cave, there is a sound like silk strings playing together, and gongs and drums chiming in unison. The more you listen, the more interesting and immersive it becomes. The Wei and Tang dynasties built temples in the mountains, which were rebuilt in the middle of the Qing Dynasty, named Xiangyan Quiet Realm. The flowing water, dangerous cliffs, and scenery are beautiful, but climbing is not easy. Many tourists view it from across the river from Longmen. This time, the Yi River rose and flooded the banks. The bottom layer of Buddhist caves on both sides of the cliffs was silted with mud and sand two to three feet deep. Yuwangtai and the Sprinkling Spring were also washed away, but they can be restored to their original state. However, in recent years, some foreigners have bought Buddha statues at high prices, and it is said that a complete Buddha head can fetch two to three hundred gold. The ignorant and unscrupulous people have frantically stolen them, and consequently, most of the millions of Buddha heads have been smashed. In reality, it is feared that even one out of a hundred so-called complete Buddha heads cannot be found. However, the achievements of ancient Chinese culture and art have unfortunately been almost completely destroyed, and future generations will not know what they were. This is truly an irredeemable loss. Therefore, the intention of certain foreigners to promote the purchase of Buddha heads is not to truly treasure them, but to destroy and obliterate the culture of others, which is already evident.</p>
<p>Returning to the city from Yique along the main road, passing Guan Gong's tomb (15 li from the city), commonly known as Guanlin, the ancient cypresses are dense, and the halls are magnificent. The tomb is behind the hall, rising like a mound. Sun Quan sent Guan Yu's head to Cao Cao, who buried it here with the rites of a feudal lord. Later generations revered and worshipped him, and this tradition has not declined over time. On the 13th day of each lunar month, and the annual Lesser Fullness solar term, villagers gather here to form a market, called "Ganjing Shisan," one to commemorate Guan Gong's single-sword assembly on May 13th of that year, and one to trade agricultural tools and living goods. That day happened to be the date of "Ganjing Shisan," and the noise could be heard from miles away. Merchants gathered from all directions and set up stalls on the spot. Some sold agricultural tools, some sold cloth, some sold groceries, some sold livestock, some sang drum operas, some told fortunes, and some sold dog skin plaster. The scene was quite similar to the temple fairs and Tianqiao street markets in Beiping. However, in the temple fairs and Tianqiao in Beiping, there are often modern young women, Western-dressed youths, and even so-called sightseers with blue eyes, who often mingle among them, and the goods sold are mostly dazzling and imported. Even the appeals of playing tricks borrow the false name of Western magic. Here, the buyers and sellers of "Ganjing Shisan" are all dressed in coarse cloth and short shirts. From a distance, they look rustic, and upon closer inspection, they are hardworking and thrifty. What is traded are agricultural products or agricultural implements, with very few urban luxury goods. Because of the recent floods, everyone wore a worried expression on their faces. Some were praying for good fortune in front of Guan Di's statue, and some were sitting on the grass, listening respectfully to books about the cycle of karma and retribution, feeling fearful and devout, and superstition seemed to deepen. This is the difference between "Ganjing Shisan" and the temple fairs in Beiping. Commerce in Luoyang is quite depressed, for the following reasons: (1) With the westward extension of the Longhai Railway, Shaanxi and Gansu can trade directly with the ports of Tianjin and Hankou, no longer passing through Luoyang as a transshipment point. (2) Frequent droughts and floods have bankrupted the rural economy, and the purchasing power of the general public is low. (3) The money market is tight, and turnover is not smooth. Although the Central Bank has a branch here, it does not redeem notes or lend money. The Henan Agriculture and Industry Bank's office charges a daily interest rate of 1.6%, which seems rather high, and it does not make loans to rural areas. The economy in the countryside is not active, and the city gates are affected by it. Therefore, more than 100 commercial firms have gone bankrupt in the past six months, and only more than 30 new ones have opened. Fortunately, former Commissioner and County Magistrate Wang Cifu abolished many exorbitant taxes and levies, reducing the burden and allowing those who have not yet collapsed to barely survive. At present, all sectors are eagerly hoping that the banking sector will come here to provide loans to help revive the agricultural and commercial economy. It is reported that the rural villages will be reorganized from district offices to district public offices, emphasizing the selection of district chiefs and increasing the power of district chiefs. The original eight districts in the county will be reorganized into five offices, which will be implemented in September, in order to carry out rural construction. If the banking sector can take advantage of this post-disaster political reform to make rural loans in conjunction, then both people and I will benefit greatly.</p>
<p>Returning east from Luoyang, passing through Yanshi and Gongxian, the floodwater in the fields gradually receded, but there was a lot of sand covering the land, and fertile soil had turned into barren land. If the滩地is slowly accumulated by gentle currents into new silt, it will turn into fertile land. However, if you want to sow and have a bountiful harvest, you can only wait for the coming spring. Yanshi is completely submerged, and remains untouched to this day. The proposal to relocate the seat of government, I hope, can be implemented soon, so that those of the flood victims who have the energy to spare can plan for long-term residence. The county was struck suddenly and the towns drowned. The number of the dead in the towns according to surveyors is over two hundred and thirty, including the magistrate's wife, who also perished. The disaster was so terrible that it can be expected that the number will exceed the numbers once the remains are retrieved.</p>
<p>As the train entered the territory of Zheng County, the eyes were finally spared from the flood. However, according to a survey, the heavy rain on July 24 caused the Wei River and Jialu River to overflow, and the affected area reached 400 square li, with houses collapsing and fields submerged, and the number of people waiting for relief was also around 20,000. The Gu Cheng Station, the site of the ancient Bi Kingdom station office, is a palace-style building, surrounded by green紗帐, with a majestic temple in the middle, with碧瓦朱壁, which looks very ancient and elegant. However, it is a small station, with only two or three passengers getting on and off. Two or three out of ten of the crops in the Jiaochang area of Zhongmou County are still immersed in shallow water, with yellow leaves and withered ears. The railroad tracks run side by side with the Yellow River, a distance of twenty or thirty li apart, the water that I had seen was rain and not from the river. The land is flat and the agricultural products are historically plentiful. Zhang Liang's hammer struck the Emperor Qin Shi Huang's Bolangsha, which is located in the north of the county bordering Yangwu County. When the train reached Kaifeng, I got off the train and entered the city. The city gate was half-open,砌with sandbags, and there were many soldiers guarding it. The atmosphere was tense, as if facing a formidable enemy. This is because of guarding the Yellow River from collapsing, because the political and economic center of the province is here.</p>
<h3>Impressions of a Southern Journey</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Qian Hua</p>
<p>(24) Li Pinxian's Talk</p>
<p>The current Director of Border Defense of the Guangxi Border and Concurrent General Director of Anti-Flooding Affairs, Mr. Li Pinxian, has been in office since 1932, exactly three full years. Mr. Li has long held military command and has profound strategic planning skills, with a reputation throughout the country. In his free time, he enjoys swimming and playing tennis, and he is well-versed in writing and calligraphy. He is uninhibited and informal, with the demeanor of a Confucian general. The reporter stayed in the Border Defense Director's office for two nights and repeatedly met and talked with Mr. Li, discussing various aspects of the southwestern border defense situation. Mr. Li said that the border defense of Longzhou was actually built single-handedly by Director Su Yuanchun. Only one-tenth of the national treasury funds were received, and nine-tenths were raised by Director Su from military pay. He loved the country and the people, and temples and shrines are all over Longzhou, and the people's praise has not waned. Later, Zheng Xiaoxu succeeded him, but with the accumulated habits of a civil official, he indulged in poetry and wine, and border affairs were neglected as a result. Since the founding of the Republic, Lu Rongting did not know what border defense was, and he did not ask about it even more. When I took over, it happened to be the outbreak of the January 28th Incident. Border affairs were tense, and the international situation was expanding. The border areas were also preparing for war. The Po Nam關was closed, and entry and exit were prohibited. Before long, the League of Nations suppressed Japan, and France shared our interests, so it made every effort to unite with us. The French Governor-General of Vietnam even invited Governor of Guangxi Huang Xuchu and I to a high-level banquet, subtly expressing the intention to resolve previous grievances, and the traffic of the 鎭南關was also restored. Since then, messengers from both sides have traveled back and forth, and there has been peace and tranquility. Regarding the unequal small details of various previous trades, they have been successively revised, and now we have reached the principle of complete equality and mutual benefit. France has a good-neighborly spirit and has a considerable understanding of our country, so there is no intention to despise us. For example, recently, when the elderly mother of Xiang Hanping was kidnapped and the bandits fled into Annam, after notifying the French side, they immediately dispatched dozens of soldiers and several armored vehicles to surround and capture the kidnappers and rescue the hostages. Another example is that when France newly promulgated the tobacco tax regulations, our merchants did not know about it in advance, and when they transported tobacco into Vietnam, they were detained and fined. After negotiating with the French side, the French negotiators said, "The fine has been submitted, and there is no way to do it except for me to take out the money myself and return it to your merchant." This is another incident. In short, diplomacy takes politics and military affairs as its backing. Only when we respect ourselves can others respect us. The Border Defense Secretary's office was built during the late Qing Dynasty, with a magnificent appearance and beautiful gardens. On the walls of the front corridor of the large hall, there is still a poem inscribed by Zheng Xiaoxu, which reads, "Falling into the southern wilderness, suddenly until today, a belly of melancholy, alone, muttering. The surrounding mountains are really what is the point, it is difficult to stop the Long River from going north." The lower paragraph says "Yiji September Xiaoxu". There are also several plum trees planted in the courtyard, and the hall is named Meizhai. It is said that Zheng was fond of 金少梅, the mother of 金月梅, but he could not get his wish from tens of thousands of miles away, so he titled the plum to quench his thirst. The old thief was lustful, as he has always been. When the reporter arrived in Longzhou, it happened that Mr. Li Pinxian had been promoted to Chief of General Staff of the Fourth Army Group. It is said that the post of Border Defense Director will be abolished, and the post of Concurrent General Director of Anti-Flooding Affairs will remain. The successor will definitely continue to work hard to ensure that border affairs are not neglected.</p>
<p>(25) The Majestic and Perilous 鎭南關</p>
<p>Among the anti-flood passes in Longzhou, 鎭南關is the most majestic and perilous, and it has the most glorious value in history. It was when the 鎭南關was attacked and broken by the French army on the ninth day of the first month of the eleventh year of Guangxu, the Guangxi governor Pan Dingxin ordered馮子材 and 王孝祺to assist. The eleventh French soldiers burned the checkpoint and retreated to Lạng Sơn. At the time our soldiers were weak and our equipment was worn out. Guangxi was shocked. 馮子材 and others vowed to exist and die with the checkpoint. The French military attacked the checkpoint on the seventh day of the second month. The situation was critical by the eighth day. General 馮, who was seventy years of age, wore short clothing and grass shoes, and holding a spear, shouted loudly and jumped on the wall and fought against the enemies. He himself cut down dozens of retreating soldiers. The three armies risked their lives and the French army was defeated. They then united with Liu Yongfu's Black Flag soldiers and chased them, defeating them at Lạng Sơn. In the last century, China suffered frequent foreign troubles and many national humiliations, the only wars in which we could raise our eyebrows were the wars at 鎭南關 and Lạng Sơn. 鎭南關belongs to 憑祥county, surrounded by high mountains and dangerous terrains. In the late Qing Dynasty, the French built a railway at 同登, which was eight li from 鎭南關. Since then, the Chinese and Vietnamese people who came and went between the borders, used 鎭南關 as a major passageway, increasing its importance. On the morning of the seventeenth, at around seven o'clock, accompanied by Mr. Dai Shaoying, the Director of Education of the Border Defence Office, I went to 鎭南關 to pay respects. The checkpoint was about 143 li from Longzhou, and the car twisted and turned into the mountain for about two hours before arriving. There was a branch office and a customs office. Mr. Huang Tinghui was a committee member and had studied in France. A native of Guangdong, he was familiar with the area. He had been in office since 1926 and was certainly a useful diplomat. The checkpoint was a few hundred steps away from the Office. There are two sets of city walls. On the outside walls are four large characters, which were written by Lu Rongting: 南疆重鎭. The inner walls are the three characters of the checkpoint, written by Zheng Xiaoxu. Because of his collaboration, the three characters of Zheng Xiaoxu have been removed. The checkpoint is located on凹of two high mountains and is not very high. Three 重砲臺were constructed at the top of the mountain to defend from above: 鎭中, 鎭南, and 鎭北. It is difficult for an army to pass. The fort on the mountains across was owned by the Vietnamese, but they were lower and in an inferior position compared to the Chinese. In touring the historically significant area, the scenes of the battles appeared before our eyes as though they were happening in the present. Our spirits were lifted in the humid heat, and we felt as if we had taken 清凉散.</p>
<p>(26) Government Office of the Literary 淵 District in Annam</p>
<p>I was able to gain a permit from the Border Defense Director and a temporary passport from Huang Tinghui. We traveled in car and there was a wooden sign that read: 安南境由此進. We presented passports at the鐵bridge because we had entered Annam. Past the bridge was the French customs. 同登belongs to the 文淵district of 諒山省, Tokyo. The government office is there. After Vietnam returned to France, 西貢 was divided into a colony and 安南， 東京， 老家， 甘埔寨 divided into protectorates. 安南still had a king and appointed officials, but the French controlled the military and administrative powers. The provinces were divided into 省九州一府, and then counties under it. 同登is a small town that is very clean with Western influence. The street signs are still in Chinese, such as 生意街. In the government office the furnishings are very similar to that of Chinese offices. There were 金字embroidered red satin that read: 世濟其美, 恩癸生佛. The district chief Yang Shaozhen greeted us in a silk hat, white 布 short shirt, long 布 pants, and拖鞋. He can speak Cantonese, French, and Vietnamese. He answered my questions thoroughly. He was a secretary for the Director of Anti-Flood and moved to be the chief. French officials were the highest with the 总督followed by 省留守使. A portrait of the emperor was hanging in the office. The official explained that the emperor was 22 and that he graduated from Paris high school 5 years ago. He was referred to as Bảo Đại and this was Bảo Đại 10 years. We also learned that 孔子was very respected in Vietnam, and that senior officials must pay respects at the temple during spring and fall. I then invited the chief to photograph. In the picture the chief had a black silk shirt, over a white shirt, with red characters that read 文淵州知州. We toured the town. There was a small school with the curriculum in Vietnamese but in French spelling. In 30 years the Vietnamese characters will be all but disappeared. There was a 中華會館 that had representatives.</p>

He left Nanjing on the evening of the 27th and arrived in Beiping at 8:19 a.m. on the 29th. There were many people welcoming him at the East Railway Station of Qianmen. Secretary-General Yu Jiaji of the Political Readjustment Council, along with senior officials from all departments and sections, were almost all present at the station. After Wang got off the train and exchanged pleasantries with the welcomers, he immediately took a car to the East Building of the Political Readjustment Council to rest. Many guests came to visit, but Wang, due to his long journey, was unable to meet them all. He only met with Beiping Mayor Yuan Liang, Chahar Province Chairman Qin Dechun, and Beiping-Tianjin Garrison Commander Wang Shuchang separately. At around 10 o'clock, Wang personally called Secretary-General Yu Jiaji and instructed all department and section chiefs of the Political Readjustment Council to gather at the East Building for instructions. In his speech, Wang briefly described his trip south and stated that he had received a personal instruction from President Wang of the Executive Yuan to have the Beiping Political Readjustment Council conclude its work immediately. He hoped that his colleagues would complete all matters handled by the end of this month and await further instructions. After the speech, Wang left the meeting and returned to his private residence in Gali Hutong in the West City. All departments and sections of the Political Readjustment Council began their conclusion work at 1 p.m. that afternoon, and due to the limited time, they would work through the night to ensure completion by the 31st.</p>
<p>Wang Kemin's Remarks</p>
<p>After news of Wang Kemin's passage through Tianjin from Nanjing at dawn on the 29th reached Beiping, a reporter specially went to Fengtai to meet him. He was granted an audience, and according to Wang's brief remarks, "I went to Nanjing this time in response to a summons and met President Wang several times. Following Wang's instructions, I hurriedly returned north after staying in Nanjing for one night and two days. I originally intended to visit Huang (Fu) in Moganshan, but I abandoned the idea. As for the various issues discussed with President Wang, I am afraid it will be difficult to disclose them before they are implemented. The date of the sixth plenary session of the Beiping Political Readjustment Council is still difficult to predict. When the meeting is held in the future, there may not be any important cases to discuss. When I passed through Jinan last night, I met with Chairman Han (Fuju) at the station. The severity of the floods in Western Shandong is unprecedented. Han was originally scheduled to come to Beiping last night, but upon hearing that the meeting had been postponed, he decided to wait for a meeting notification before starting his journey. The North China Economic Coordination Council is mainly composed of leaders from the banking and business sectors, with the government only in a supporting role. Its organizational plan will be announced soon. Regarding the issue of navigation between inside and outside the customs, it is being handled directly by the Ministry of Communications. I have not heard anything about the progress of the negotiations or its current status. Recently in North China, in addition to the two cases of Tao (Shangming) and Liu (Zuozhou), no new issues have arisen. Minister He (Yingqin)'s stationing in the north has not been confirmed, and there is no news of Chairman Huang (Fu) coming north either. Regarding the foreign reports that Japanese industrial and commercial experts will hold meetings in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Beiping in stages, I have not received any reports on this matter, so I do not know the details."

<h3>Yixian County Magistrate Cables Request to Stop Water Obstruction in Han River – Many Houses Collapsed in Tengxian</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Yellow River has risen again, and the flooding in the disaster area is becoming more widespread. The people of Northern Jiangsu have already built two horizontal dams on Wangmu Mountain and Shengyang Mountain, extending deep into the Grand Canal. Today (28th), Yixian County Magistrate Liu Huating reported to the provincial government that the situation was serious, stating in a telegram, "Report, the Huai River Guidance Association and the laborers of Pixian County, Jiangsu, have already built two horizontal dams in the Grand Canal between Wangmu and Shengyang Mountains, extending deep into the river, obstructing the water and flooding southern Shandong and a few villages in Tongshan and Pi counties. Now, they are throwing stones and hemp bags into the riverbed between the two dam heads, intending to raise the riverbed and obstruct the downstream flow. Obstructing the water in the Han River in this way, at the expense of neighbors, disregards the lives and property of millions of people in southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu, which is truly a strange event at home and abroad. The affected people are extremely indignant and fear that they will take risks again and cause a major change. I beg you to urgently telegram the central government and the Jiangsu provincial government to strictly stop it, so as to avoid accidents. I respectfully report this, Yixian County Magistrate Liu Huating, respectfully sealed." The Tengxian County Magistrate telegraphed the provincial government to report on the recent disaster situation, stating, "(1) Blocking the railway culverts has now been completed; (2) The Chao River is still rising, and although the water from the breach west of the railway is invading eastward, the situation has eased; (3) The mountain water in Xiazhen has entered the streets, and the Grand Canal has overflowed its banks, causing many houses to collapse. We are still doing our best to protect it; (4) The water from the breach in Pei County has flowed eastward to Xiwancun; (5) The new dam at the Pengkou sluice gate has been strengthened with straw and heightened by one foot due to the mountain floods and accumulated water outside the embankment. Although it is not out of danger, it has also eased; (6) I respectfully report that I accompanied you from Lincheng back to the city and will temporarily stay to handle important official matters. I respectfully report, Tengxian County Magistrate Xie Xiwenting, respectfully sealed (28th)."</p>
<h3>Jingqiu Railway: Jingzhe Section Surveyed and Completed</h3>
<p>The Route is Estimated to Be 400 Kilometers Long, Requiring Construction Costs of Over 40 Million</p>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: In order to shorten the Jingguang (Beijing-Guangzhou) journey, the Ministry of Railways had previously planned to construct the Jingguang Railway. In the spring of this year, a survey team was organized, and Zheng Hua, the Chief of the Design Section of the Ministry and a representative of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, was appointed as the team leader. In May, he led more than 30 employees and departed from Beijing for the survey. After three months, the entire section has now been surveyed. Team Leader Zheng has returned to Beijing to report. It is understood that the route surveyed by the team this time goes from Nanjing through Lishui into Anhui Province, passing through Guancheng, Ningguo, Xu Xi, Huizhou, Shendu, and then into Zhejiang Province, passing through Chun'an, Shouchang, Longyou, and other places to connect with the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. The total length is 400 kilometers, requiring a cost of 42.2 million yuan. From Longyou onwards, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway will be fully utilized, passing through Yushan, Nanchang, Pingxiang, to Zhuzhou, and then connecting with the Yuehan Railway to utilize the southern section to reach Guangzhou. However, the Longyou to Yushan section is currently a light-weight track, so it will need to be replaced before connecting. Also, the railway from Nanjing to Xuancheng has now been built by the Jiangnan Railway Company. If this section is also utilized, the entire journey can be shortened by another half or so, and the cost can be reduced by two-thirds. The route taken by the railway goes from Beijing along the Yangtze River through Wuhu to Xuancheng, which is slightly different from the Ministry of Railways' route. It has not yet been decided whether to utilize it or build a new one. As for the future construction project, it will be completely handled directly by the Ministry of Railways to make it a state-owned railway. Once Zheng Hua reports to the Ministry of Railways, construction can be planned. (30th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Liangcai Scholarship Donated to Red Cross</h3>
<p>The local Red Cross branch recently received a letter from the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Liangcai Scholarship, along with a donation of 500 yuan and a portrait of Mr. Shi. The chairman of the association, Zhou Xuewen, stated that Mr. Shi Liangcai was born in Songjiang, was enthusiastic about public welfare, and had a well-known reputation. He was also a pioneer in the press and a pillar of the Red Cross, worthy of respect. Therefore, in the newly renovated Yilan Building of the association, a separate room was created to enshrine the meritorious members of society, Yang Liaogong, Xiang Songmao, Lei Jixing, and Mr. Shi, in a single shrine for admiration. At the same time, a letter of gratitude was sent to the Board of Directors of the Shi Liangcai Scholarship.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Young Man Who Failed Entrance Exam Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>Yesterday (30th) at around 3:00 a.m., Yuan Yuchang, a patrolman from the Second Public Security Precinct, was patrolling the streets and saw a young man in Western attire holding grass paper, pacing back and forth at the entrance of Shipinong Lane inside Qimen. He asked him for questioning. The young man replied that he was going to call a doctor. Later, on his way back, Yuan Yuchang encountered him again at Xiatang under Qimen and asked if he had called a doctor. The young man replied that he was about to return home. Yuan then followed him. The young man, seeing that it was difficult to escape, pretended to point to a house in front of the Chen Ji Scissors Shop as his home and knocked on the door. The shop opened the door upon hearing the sound, and the young man immediately pushed the patrolman away and fled forward wildly. Yuan immediately gave chase. The young man ran to the riverbank and jumped into the river. At that time, there were many boats parked at the riverbank, and they helped to search, but found nothing. It was not until dawn that the body surfaced. It was then discovered that the deceased was Zhu Kun, the young owner of the Qiangsheng Milk Farm in Xinqiaoxiang, Qimen, 20 years old. He committed suicide because he failed the entrance exam for the Hangzhou Medical College. The family was notified to come to the scene, and the local court sent Luo Duzhi to inspect and coffin the body.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Vegetable Farmers Stop Work Collectively</h3>
<p>The abundance of pit latrines inside and outside the city of this county is unmatched by other counties. The 25 manure firms, including Longshun and Huinong, obtained licenses from the Finance Department and organized a cooperative office in the sixth section of Guangfu Gate to guide the business of each manure firm. Since then, the buying and selling of manure fertilizer has been handled by the manure firms, and the original pit owners have found it difficult to save money, while the vegetable farmers are not free. About a thousand vegetable farmers in the city area petitioned the Party headquarters, and a few days ago, hundreds of people went to the Party and government organs to express their opposition. The Party headquarters agreed to forward the matter to the county government. The county government stated that if it is not a main road, such as the pit latrines in private gardens, they can still be bought and sold as usual. If the cooperative office is obstructing them, the vegetable farmers can report the facts to the county for verification. The vegetable farmers were satisfied and withdrew, but disturbances occurred near the cooperative office, and the lanterns were smashed. The county security team maintained order and stationed guards at each city gate to prevent accidents. At that time, the situation was tense. Feng Genfa, Zou Jinrong, and Chen Xibei, three vegetable farmers, were injured and went to the local court to examine their injuries. A few days ago, 200 to 300 manure carriers from the cooperative office also went to the county to petition, demanding fair handling. The two sides were evenly matched and could not reach a decision. Since yesterday morning, the vegetable farmers have unanimously stopped work, causing great panic among the residents. Most vegetable fields only have some thin green vegetables on the roads and in the large river pools, and the rest are salted vegetables and yellow soybean sprouts. Most of them are not produced in gardens, but the prices are extremely high. Salted vegetables and thin green vegetables are 200 yuan per catty, and yellow soybean sprouts are 160 yuan per catty. The prices of other types have also increased. After this incident occurred, County Magistrate Wang Baoxuan, in addition to ordering the police to pay attention to local security, also expressed his views on the cooperative office, saying that the government could not interfere with the vegetable farmers' strike if there were no transgressions. The establishment of the cooperative office was fundamentally illegal and should be banned. The establishment of the manure firms made it difficult for the office to exist. The current dispute was entirely caused by the monopolization of the manure trade. In the future, if the above situation occurs, their licenses will be revoked immediately, and the Public Security Bureau will be ordered to investigate strictly. In the future, the government must formulate measures for managing pit latrines, and the Public Security Bureau's First District Public Security Department will thoroughly organize and avoid disputes.</p>
<h3>Provincial Committee Investigates Lake Fields and Completes Task</h3>
<p>Wang Peng, Shen Jun, Chen Heng'an, members of the Finance and Construction Departments, and Qian Tangxin, a member of the Lake Field Clearance Committee, came to Wuxi a few days ago to investigate the matter of increasing the tax on lake fields. The task has now been completed. At 5 p.m. on the 30th, Wang and others went to the county government to meet with Xie Jianzhai, the head of the Second Section, to compile a list of the lake fields in the third and fourth districts and take them to the provincial government that night to report.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Zhencheng Road Bus Robbed Midway</h3>
<p>The third bus on the Zhengchen Line (Zhenjiang to Jurong) of Zhengcheng Road departed from Zhenjiang Station at 9:10 a.m. on the 27th. When it reached between 11 and 12 kilometers, two bandits suddenly appeared in the bus, standing at the bus door, pulling out box guns and pistols, first shooting the driver in the leg, hitting his left leg. The bus was forced to stop, and the bandits robbed the 20-odd passengers in turn, none of whom were spared. After more than ten minutes, they got off the bus and left. Afterwards, the Zhengcheng Line Office of the Highway Administration sent personnel to investigate. The passengers lost more than 100 yuan. In addition to sending the injured driver to the hospital for treatment, the Provincial Highway Administration was telegraphed to forward the matter to the Construction Department to find a way to strictly arrest the fleeing bandits and bring them to justice. In order to prevent the bandits from using the same tricks again, the office, with the winter prevention approaching, yesterday (29th) specially wrote to the county government to forward the order to the local security team or public security substation at the ten stations from Menghe to Longhutang in Wujin County to send police to the stations at any time to inspect and patrol along the way to prevent accidents.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Zhejiang Province Opens Up Autumn Silkworm Purchase</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Construction Department's Silkworm and Silk Control Committee, due to the smooth sales of Chinese silk in Europe and rising market prices, and the fact that the autumn silkworm season is approaching, silk cocoon merchants are very active. Silk factories in Shanghai and this province have requested to stop the monopoly and allow merchants to freely purchase cocoons to benefit the livelihood of Chinese workers. The authorities, in order to communicate with Chongqing, have divided the silkworm mulberry areas of each county into eight districts and allowed merchants to freely purchase cocoons, but merchants in this province have priority. The measures for each district have already been formulated and will be submitted to the provincial government's routine meeting next Tuesday for approval and implementation. However, according to news from cocoon merchants, the authorities intend to designate Hangzhou City and County to be purchased by Yongtai Silk Factory, and they have expressed their opposition. As for the autumn cocoon improvement fee, 1.8 yuan per dan of dried cocoons is still collected, and they are also requesting a reduction to lighten the burden on merchants and the people.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing: Administrative Inspectorate Established</h3>
<p>The Administrative Inspectorate of the Jiaxing-Hengzhou area will be established in the county government on September 1. The Security Area Command will also be established at the former Construction Bureau site in the county government and will be established at the same time as the Commissioner's Office. In addition, Xu Wenhuan has been appointed as the Deputy Commander of the Jiaxing Area Security by the province. The Administrative Inspectorate will set up two inspectors to inspect the ten counties under its jurisdiction: Jiaxing, Jiashan, Pinghu, Haiyan, Tongxiang, Chongde, Haining, Fuyang, Xindeng, and Deqing. The commissioner is concurrently held by County Magistrate Wang Xianting.</p>
<h3>Meat Industry Requests Cancellation of Education Surtax</h3>
<p>The Jiaxing slaughter tax and surtax is 4 jiao and 5 fen per pig. Now, an additional education surtax of 1 jiao and 5 fen has been added to the tax. The meat industry is experiencing a downturn in business and is struggling to survive. The original tax and surtax were already too heavy a burden. If it is increased, it will be difficult to maintain. Currently, the Xinye Meat Industry Association and others have telegraphed the provincial and county authorities to cancel the education surtax to alleviate the suffering of the merchants.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Opium Addicts' Factory Opens</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Anti-Opium Commission has set up an opium addicts' factory in Xiaohai Town, Nantong, to accommodate opium addicts from the six counties of Tongzhou, Rugao, Chongming, Hai'an, Qidong, and Jingjiang to learn skills. The various departments in the factory have already started work. The hemp shoes and towels produced are sold to the area's security teams. The textiles, soap, and other products are transported and sold to the Jiangnan area. The special commissioner's office has been continuously sending opium addicts to the factory in recent days.</p>
<h3>Ningbo: Robbery Occurs in Western Suburbs Last Night</h3>
<p>The Maimian Bridge in the western suburbs of Ningbo has convenient transportation and a prosperous market. It is only five li from the city. Wen Xiangfu, a resident, runs the Taishan Grocery Store on the east side of the town. At around 8 p.m. on the 28th, as he was closing the door, six bandits suddenly arrived, holding pistols and flashlights, making a fierce show of force and threatening him not to make any noise. Three bandits went upstairs to search, while the other three bandits monitored Wen's actions. Soon, the three bandits carried down a box from upstairs, broke it open, and stole 200 yuan in banknotes, 95 yuan in cash, and more than 200 jiao in small change. After the robbery, they fled towards Banlu'an. After the robbery, the victim immediately reported it to the Huangulin Public Security Sub-bureau and the Bailongwang Temple Police Station to apprehend them. By the time the police team arrived, the bandits had gone far away and could not be caught.</p>

<p>Local News: Minister Kong Discusses: The Military Suppression of Bandits in Sichuan Province is Going Smoothly; Foreign Telegrams are All Rumors</p>
<p>Central News Agency: A telegram from a foreign news agency rumored unfavorable military news in Sichuan Province. The Central News Agency reporter interviewed Minister Kong, who said that he had just received a telegram from Chairman Chiang yesterday, stating that the military situation in the front was going smoothly. The communists had fled into the Min River and were in a hopeless situation, and they would be wiped out soon. The foreign reports are indeed rumors and not worth a smile. According to another source, the Zhu Xu bandits have suffered heavy losses under the siege of our bandit suppression army and are now mostly fleeing to the west bank of the Min River, where they are in a desperate situation and can be completely annihilated in the short term. As for the foreign reports that the bandits have fled near Tianshui, it is purely a rumor. Gansu Province is now extremely peaceful.</p>
<h3>New Stamp Tax Law to be Implemented Tomorrow; City Chamber of Commerce Indicates Key Points; Matters to Note During the Transition</h3>
<p>The new stamp tax law is now scheduled to be implemented on September 1. All stamp affixing methods from September 1 will also be handled in accordance with the new law. However, during this transition period, there are several points to note that merchants and manufacturers must understand. Here, Yan Ersheng, the secretary of the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, explained each point as follows:</p>
<p>Receipts for Goods: According to the old stamp tax method, it was originally not necessary to affix stamps for receipts for goods. However, the new law stipulates that a receipt for goods worth 3 yuan or more must be affixed with 1 fen, 10 yuan or more must be affixed with 1 fen, and 100 yuan or more must be affixed with 3 fen, up to 3 fen, with no further stamps required. The return receipts for letters usually used by stores and factories are receipts for sending letters and do not need to be stamped according to law. However, if it is noted outside the letter that several items of goods have been sent, then this return receipt should be stamped. Therefore, in addition to purely return receipts for letters, it is appropriate to affix stamps. As for the delivery return receipts used before September 1, they should be stamped according to law from September 1 and cannot be resisted on the grounds that the ledger was established before September 1. However, old ledgers that have been affixed with a 1-jiao stamp can be used until the closing of accounts. There is no need to affix additional stamps at this time. However, new ledgers opened after September 1 should be affixed with 2 jiao. Also, the explanation under the receipts for silver, money, and goods in the tax rate table has the sentence "except for deposit receipts from the financial industry." The meaning of this sentence is that the stamp affixing method for deposit receipts from the financial industry is separately stipulated in item 4 and item 9, etc. It does not mean that deposit receipts from the financial industry do not need to be stamped.</p>
<p>Petitions from the People: Petitions from the people submitted to government offices should be affixed with a 1-jiao stamp in accordance with category 3 of article 2 of the old regulations. However, the new stamp tax law does not have this provision and should be exempt from stamping. Also, petitions for requesting naturalization are also exempt from stamp duty under the new law.</p>
<p>Bill Reminders: Bill reminders were not required to be stamped according to the temporary regulations on stamp duty, but the Ministry later stipulated that they should be stamped. However, the new law stipulates that they are exempt from stamping. However, the explanation of bill reminders is stipulated in article 5 of the implementing rules, which refers to bill reminders used for the New Year's festival, which only list the amount owed. The bills that are customarily listed by name, quantity, value, and delivered to customers on a monthly or annual basis, such as the bills from clothing stores, should still be stamped according to law and should not be regarded as bills for soliciting debts.</p>
<p>Guarantees and Undertakings: Guarantees and undertakings were listed as one of the 45 types in category 3 of the old regulations. The new law does not have a special item for them, but they are included in item 27 of the tax rate table, which refers to documents that guarantee the proper behavior, quality, or future of a person, item, or matter, or guarantee that a certain fact will not occur. The tax rate is still 1 jiao per item.</p>
<p>Pawn Tickets: The old regulations stipulated that "pawn tickets with a loan amount of 4 yuan or more" should be stamped. The new law includes pawn tickets in item 9 on loan or mortgage documents, which refers to borrowing money from someone with goods as collateral. Each item with an amount of less than 10 yuan is exempt from stamping. The Ministry of Finance has clearly instructed the Jiangsu Provincial Pawn Industry Association Federation on this interpretation (Tax Document No. 5218). The original text is published in the Compilation of Explanations of Industrial and Commercial Laws and Regulations edited by me in the eighth issue of the Commercial Monthly. However, pawn tickets were previously required to be stamped with 1 fen each. Now, at least 2 fen must be affixed to those over 10 yuan, and 4 fen must be affixed to pawn tickets worth 101 yuan. Also, loss reports are affixed with 1 jiao per item. That is, even a loss report with only 5 jiao should be affixed with 1 jiao, while a loss report with 1,000 yuan should also be affixed with only 1 jiao.</p>
<p>Checks: Checks used by banks and money shops, and similar instruments, were subject to progressive stamping in accordance with the old regulations, starting with 1 fen up to 1 yuan and 5 jiao. However, as a result of the request from the banking and money industry associations, the Ministry of Finance approved a postponement of stamping. This time, with the implementation of the new law, all previous cases approved by the Ministry of Finance for exemption, postponement, or reduction of stamp duty have been abolished. Checks should be stamped with 2 fen each, regardless of the amount, in accordance with item 4 of the tax rate table. Although the Shanghai Banking Association has repeatedly requested a postponement of stamping, the new tax law is a formal law passed by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the National Government, which is not comparable to temporary regulations. It cannot be changed by administrative order. Even if there are amendments, they should go through legislative procedures. Therefore, before the Legislative Yuan officially amends it, all checks issued after September 1 should be stamped with 2 fen each according to law. The above items are the most common and should be noted during the transition between the old and new tax laws. A detailed comparison is published in the special issue on the stamp tax law in the eighth issue of the Commercial Monthly published by the City Chamber of Commerce. However, the initial edition of 5,000 copies has been sold out. The section on stamp duty is being extracted and printed separately as a special publication, which can be published around September 4. The price is 1 jiao and 5 fen per copy, plus 3 fen for postage outside the city.</p>
<h3>Bank Association Executive Committee Discusses Stamp Tax on Checks: Temporarily Comply with Stamping During Petition Period</h3>
<p>The Bankers Association held its 73rd Executive Committee meeting at 2 p.m. yesterday in the Association's fifth-floor conference room to discuss the stamp tax on checks. It was decided that, during the petition period, they would temporarily comply with stamping and issue an urgent notice to all bank check users. Details of the situation are recorded below. Attendees at the meeting included members of the Bankers Association, Executive Committee members, and representatives from various banks, including Wang Boyuan, Wang Zhixin, Chen Shizhen, Zhu Huisheng, Qu Jigang, Le Gengrong, Fan Jifu, Hu Xian, Huang Mohan, Chen Zheqing, Lu Zidong, Wu Weiru, Xu Xinliu, Qi Zhi, Tang Shoumin, Hu Bijiang, Yuan Mengqin, Zhu Zikui, Yao Yinpeng, Song Ziliang, Jing Runshi, Ye Fuxiao, Zhuang Zhi, Tong Ting, Xu Jilu, Wei Jinsan, Rao Taoshu, and Lin Kanghou as observer. Xu Jilu chaired the meeting.</p>
<p>After formal greetings, the minutes of the 72nd Executive Committee and the 68th Standing Committee meetings were read. The meeting then moved on to discuss the agenda. (1) A letter from Jiangsu Bank requesting a change of member representative was approved. (2) Regarding the issue of stamp tax on checks, it was decided that during the petition period, they would temporarily comply with stamping and publish a notice. (3) A report on the total amount of disaster relief loans underwritten by various banks and discussion of the loan agreement format. It was decided to urge the banks that have not yet confirmed to do so promptly and to review the loan agreements. (4) A letter from the Bengbu Banking Association requesting assistance regarding the Railway Department's failure to issue bills of lading for goods loaded and unloaded on dedicated sidings, which affects bank mortgage loans. It was decided to forward the matter to the Railway Department for investigation. The meeting adjourned at 4 p.m.</p>
<p>Urgent Notice: Yesterday, the Association issued an urgent notice to all bank check users stating: "The new Stamp Tax Law promulgated by the National Government is scheduled to take effect on September 1st. According to Article 4 of the tax rate schedule, each bank check, regardless of the amount, must be stamped with two cents. The stamping method should be carried out by the issuer (i.e., the drawer) himself when issuing the check, in accordance with the law. In order to encourage the circulation of negotiable instruments and reduce the burden on check users, the Association has repeatedly petitioned the Ministry of Finance to exempt stamping in accordance with the Provisional Regulations on Stamp Tax. As of now, the case is still under consideration. However, the implementation period of the new law is approaching soon. Most bank check users may not be familiar with the tax payment procedures, and it is inevitable that stamp omissions will occur when the law goes into effect. However, upon inspection, there is a risk of being punished according to the law, which makes it difficult for both the bank and the depositors. As the people's obligation is to abide by the government's laws, this meeting has resolved to await instructions while, during the request period, asking all bank check users to comply with stamping in accordance with the regulations in order to avoid disputes caused by violating the law. In addition to notifying the banks in attendance for their information, this notice is specially published in the newspaper to request the attention of all sectors.</p>
<h3>Huang Shaoxiong Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday: Will First Return to Hangzhou and Then Go to Beijing</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Huang Shaoxiong, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, went to Hong Kong and then to Guangdong and Guangxi some time ago. He returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon around 1 p.m. aboard the Dollar Line's President Lincoln, which docked at the 11th and 12th docks of Yangshupu. Those who went to welcome him included Mayor Wu's representative Tang Shixuan, Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi's representative in Shanghai Huang Jianping, Zhang Boxuan, a consultant of the Military Affairs Commission, Zhang Ming, and many of Huang's relatives and friends. After Huang disembarked, he transferred to a small tugboat, and around 2:30 p.m., he landed at the Customs Wharf and went directly to his private residence on Shanzhong Road to rest. Those who accompanied Huang to Shanghai included Mrs. Huang and their sons and daughters, as well as Secretary Zhong Shuren and many attendants. Huang met with reporters from various newspapers on board yesterday afternoon. According to him, his trip south was to handle personal matters and had no other mission. In Guangdong and Guangxi, he met with Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, and Bai Chongxi. The comrades in the Southwest did not raise any special opinions regarding the Central Government and all advocated that in this time of national crisis, only sincere unity can save the country. They are all trying to find solutions to the current situation. The issue of the abolition of the Southwest Political Affairs Committee and the Executive Department was not discussed. The Sixth Plenary Session will be held in Beijing. Guangxi Province nominated Huang Xuchu and Li Zongren to attend. The committee members from Guangdong Province are not yet known. He had not heard of the rumors that Hu Zhan and Wang Chonghui had returned to China. He plans to return to Hangzhou first in a day or two, and then go to Beijing. As for when he will go to Sichuan to meet with Chairman Chiang, it has not yet been decided.</p>

<h3>Li Dijun Boards Ship to Japan Last Night to Investigate the News Industry</h3>
<p>Li Dijun, Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was dispatched to foreign countries to investigate the news industry. He arrived in Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday and stayed at the New Asia Hotel on Tiantong Road. The night before last, he attended a banquet hosted by the Shanghai branch of the Japanese Asahi Shimbun. Yesterday morning at 11 o'clock, he went to the Japanese Consulate on Huangpu Road to visit Japanese Ambassador Arima Akira and talked for half an hour. Li's visit to Arima was because Arima had sent a special telegram to his home country, providing him with convenience during Li's visit to Japan, so he went to express his gratitude. Yesterday afternoon, Yu Ming, the Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, hosted a farewell banquet. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency interviewed Li at his residence yesterday. According to Li, he was dispatched to foreign countries to investigate the news industry, as well as political and economic situations. This trip will go to Japan, and then to European and American countries. However, whether he will definitely go to Europe and America will be decided temporarily after arriving in Japan for investigation. Li boarded the Dollar Line's President Lincoln last night and left Shanghai for Japan. The ship is scheduled to set sail at 3 a.m. this morning.</p>
<h3>Li Zeyi and Li Shijia Arrive in Shanghai Together Yesterday Afternoon: Li Zeyi Goes to Beijing to Meet Wang Within Days, Li Shijia Takes Leave to Seek Medical Treatment in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Li Zeyi, a member of the Fujian Provincial Government, and Li Shijia, commander of the Mawei Fortress, traveled together on the Sanbei Company's Wanxiang ship, arriving in Shanghai at 11:40 yesterday morning. The ship docked at the Ningshao Wharf at the 16th pier. Relatives and friends of the two in Shanghai all went to welcome them. According to Li Zeyi, the local situation in Fujian Province is very stable, but the provincial treasury is short of funds and finances are relatively difficult. After a short rest in Shanghai, he will go to Beijing to meet with President Wang within days to report everything. The date of his visit to Huang Chairman (Fu) in Moganshan has not yet been decided. According to Li Shijia, his old illness has relapsed, so he has taken leave to seek medical treatment in Shanghai. He plans to go to Beijing next week to meet with Minister Chen (Shaokuan) to report on defense affairs. It is expected that he will be able to return to Fujian to handle affairs in mid-next month.</p>
<h3>Nanhua Company's Hua Wu Ship Runs Aground in Japan: Both Ship and Crew Are Insured</h3>
<p>The Nanhua Company's Hua Wu ship was originally an Austrian ship confiscated by our Navy during the European War. It was later purchased by the Nanhua Company and continued to use the name Hua Wu. The ship is very large, with a carrying capacity of 4,249 tons. The manager is Zhao Fuchen, and the shipowner is Norwegian Johnson. Recently, the ship has been rented to others to transport coal and mineral sands between China and Japan.</p>
<p>Going to Japan to Unload Cargo</p>
<p>Last time, it was fully loaded with iron sand at Ma'anshan Island and sailed to Yokohama to unload the cargo. When leaving Pukou for Japan, it hit and damaged the towing wharf. When it arrived at Wusong, it lost an anchor. After the ship was equipped and sailed to Japan, the cargo was unloaded and prepared to return. The ship's chief mate telegraphed Zhao Fuchen, reporting that the shipowner was slightly ill and asking for instructions. Zhao replied by telegram, asking them to return to Shanghai quickly, planning to send them to Qinhuangdao to transport coal to Japan.</p>
<p>Encountering a Typhoon and Running Aground</p>
<p>The ship set sail from Yokohama and returned to Shanghai. At about 3 a.m. on the 29th, when it was about to arrive at Kobe in Mie Prefecture, Watarai County, Sukuta, and off the coast of Sumura, 50 meters away, it encountered a typhoon. There were many hidden reefs in the area, making navigation difficult. The ship ran aground there, and the hull was stranded on the reefs. The storm and rain hit fiercely, and the situation was very dangerous. Wireless and other equipment were destroyed, so they could not send an emergency message to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Crew Rescued</p>
<p>The crew members were helpless because it was late at night. It was not until dawn that they were discovered by local Japanese residents, who organized a rescue team and sent a boat to the place where the Hua Wu ran aground, rescuing some of the crew members and sailors and taking them ashore. The Shanghai company has not yet received a detailed telegram on how many people were rescued. They telegraphed Japan yesterday to inquire.</p>
<p>Confirmation by Telegram</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, reporters went to various parties to investigate the truth about the Hua Wu ship accident. Although it was already known that it had encountered misfortune, the Nanhua Company had not yet received an official telegram and still could not get accurate information. It was not until 5 p.m. that the company received a telegram from Kobe forwarded by the Japanese Daido Trading Company, stating that the Hua Wu ship had indeed encountered a typhoon and ran aground at the above-mentioned location, and the situation was very dangerous.</p>
<p>Only Dismantling Is Possible</p>
<p>The telegram was sent from Kobe at 9 a.m. yesterday and arrived in Shanghai in the afternoon. It was written in English, with only a few words, briefly stating that the Hua Wu ship ran aground very badly, and the hull had sunk into the reefs. There was no hope of rescue. Only the ship's hull can be dismantled, the telegram said. Upon receiving the news, Nanhua immediately reported it to the China Ship Insurance Joint Association and tried to investigate the loss of the ship.</p>
<p>Telegraphing the Consul</p>
<p>Based on this telegram, Zhao Fuchen first telegraphed the Chinese Consulate in Kobe in the name of the company, asking the Kobe Consulate to send someone to the scene of the Hua Wu ship accident to thoroughly investigate the loss of the ship in order to proceed with rescue operations. He also asked how many crew members were rescued and whether there were any crew members who died in the accident, and asked the Consulate to investigate and send the rescued crew members back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Insurance Issues</p>
<p>The Hua Wu ship hull was insured with the China Ship Insurance Joint Association in this port for a total of 120,000 yuan for peace of mind insurance. All the crew members on board were also insured with the Maritime Accident Insurance Company in this port for accident insurance of 30,000 yuan. Therefore, even if the entire ship is damaged and the crew members are killed, there is compensation to be obtained. The Nanhua Company will not suffer any loss. The effectiveness of the crew's accident insurance is now seen to be very effective.</p>

<h3>Oil Cake Merchants Oppose Guangdong's Tax Levy: Guangdong, Hankou, and Shantou Gangs Join the Strike: Manufacturers from Various Places Hold a Joint Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Countermeasures: Invite the City's News Media to Uphold Justice: Chairman Chiang's Instructions to Wait for Resolution</h3>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, oil cake and miscellaneous grain manufacturers from various places have repeatedly requested the abolition of Guangdong's implementation of additional import levies on bran, which is scheduled to start on September 1, but have not been approved. They have all suspended business and transportation since the day before yesterday. A joint meeting was held at 3 p.m. yesterday to discuss countermeasures and representatives were sent to the Central and Southwest authorities to petition. Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, referred the case to the Executive Yuan for review. Guangdong, Hankou, and Shantou manufacturers also suspended business yesterday. Gu Xinyi, Chairman of the Miscellaneous Grain Association, hosted the news media last night to report the process. The details are as follows.</p>
<p>Joint Meeting of Manufacturers from Various Places</p>
<p>Representatives from the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Association of this city and oil factory and cake merchants from various places held an emergency meeting at 3 p.m. yesterday on the third floor of the Miscellaneous Grain Market on Minguo Road. Attendees included Chen Ziyi from Kunshan Housheng, He Quansheng from the Guangdong manufacturers in Shanghai, Wu Yongkang from Shunyu, Zhang Xiande from Lide, Tang Wenxiong from the same surname, Huang Jikuan from Changzhou Xie Feng, Jiang Hongbin from Wuxi Runfeng, Cao Xingeng from Changzhou Xiefeng, Gu Xinyi, Zhu Zixiang, Yan Xiaoquan, Cai Yukun, Chuan Changyu, Yang Heqing from the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Association, as well as Wu Zisheng, Guo Yousheng, Yu Bingwen, Chen Yunqing, Ye Tingfan, Luo Rongzhou, Xia Xingcun, Feng Yongsheng, Chen Shide, Wu Yiyan, Zhong Cunfu, Liu Liugu, Chen Shaoming, Chen Yuming, He Zhegu, Liao Shiquan, Tan Jingrun, Qian Zanlin, Zhu Wenchang, and over forty others from the oil cake manufacturers. Gu Xinyi chaired the meeting, and Kong Rulin recorded the minutes.</p>
<p>Decide to Resolve the Abolition</p>
<p>After formal greetings, Chairman Gu Xinyi reported on the case of Guangdong's donation merchants contracting to levy bran donations. Representatives then expressed their opinions and immediately discussed (1) Guangdong Province's donation merchants are scheduled to contract to levy an additional fee of 25 cents per dan for imported bean cakes and raw cakes for the construction of Sun Yat-sen University, which is a matter of vital interest to the industry. Please discuss countermeasures. (According to the manufacturers and cake merchants' decision, the Guangdong donation merchants will implement the levy of cake donations on September 1, that is, manufacturers will stop work and cake merchants will stop transportation from that day. Please inform the factory and transportation parties to express their firm stance together in order to promote the attention of the authorities. The meeting decided to telegraph the factories in Hankou about the case, urging them to handle it uniformly in order to avoid delaying the opportunity and to send representatives to Shanghai to discuss the progress together. (2) Organize a petition group to petition the central and southwest authorities separately, requesting to stop the collection of additional donations in order to reduce the burden on farmers and avoid affecting industrial and commercial operations. It was decided to telegraph the Commander-in-Chief of the First Army Group in the Southwest, the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, the Guangdong Provincial Government, the Municipal Party Department, the Finance Commissioner's Office, the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce, the Guangzhou Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Association, the Shantou Chamber of Commerce, the North and South Port Trade Association, the Miscellaneous Grain Association, the Central Administrative Yuan, Chairman Chiang, the Ministry of Industry, and the Ministry of Finance, making a firm statement. In addition, representatives will be sent to form a petition group to petition the central and southwest authorities separately. Wait for the Hankou representatives to arrive in Shanghai before proceeding. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's Instructions to Wait for Resolution</p>
<p>The Miscellaneous Grain Association, Guangzhao Guild Hall, Guangdong Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association, and other groups in this city jointly telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, to strictly order the cessation of the collection of bran donations. The association received Chairman Chiang's instructions yesterday morning, stating, "A telegram has been submitted regarding the case of Guangzhou donation merchants contracting the annual salary for bran. Please forward it to the Executive Yuan for review and cancellation, and according to the original case, non-imported goods will be permanently exempted from taxation, which is in line with the recent purpose of exempting from excessive taxes and levies, and farmers and businesses will both benefit from it. The telegram has been read. Wait for the Executive Yuan to review it. Please wait for the solution." This instruction, August 29, 24th year of the Republic of China, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Seal.</p>
<p>Hankou, Guangdong, and Shantou Also Followed Suit by Suspending Business</p>
<p>Since oil cake manufacturers from Shanghai, Wuxi, Dangzhou, Kunshan, and other places have jointly suspended business and transportation since the day before yesterday, the Hankou and Guangdong and Shantou sides have also telegraphed to express their unanimous action. According to the reporter from the Dagong News Agency, after inquiring from the Zhuang companies stationed in Shanghai by various Bangs, manufacturers from Guangdong Shantou and Hankou also participated in the implementation yesterday morning, stopping transactions. Three representatives from Hankou have set off for Shanghai and will arrive in Shanghai in the next few days to discuss the progress together. The Guangdong Bang Shanghai merchants group, Shenshou Hall, also held an emergency meeting last night to discuss all coping measures, so as to achieve the goal of abolishing additional donations, it said.</p>
<p>Damage to the News Media Reports the Process</p>
<p>The Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Association hosted the news media in this city at the Xicaishe Western Restaurant on Simalu at 2 p.m. yesterday. Over sixty reporters from various newspapers attended. At the banquet, Gu Xinyi reported the Guangdong donation merchants contracting to levy donations as follows: Bean cake and peanut cake (called bean bran and cow bran in Guangdong) are inherent products of our country and are essential for farmers to fertilize their fields. Most of the products were transported and sold from the three northeastern provinces. Recently, in response to the needs of the times, manufacturers in various parts of the country have successively established factories and registered for manufacturing. There are a total of twenty factories in Shanghai, Hankou, Wuxi, Wujin, Kunshan, and other places. Tens of thousands of workers rely on it for their livelihood. The output has increased sharply, and the locks are all over the country. Guangzhou and Shantou are regarded as profitable because of the large number of sales. They secretly presented to the Finance Commissioner's Office, "Imported fertilizers still have bean bran and raw bran from Dalian and Niuzhuang and other places that have not borne donations and taxes. Please levy additional fees in the same way as imported goods, at eight dimes per dan." This is the first page of the donation merchants' attempt to indiscriminately levy domestic cake bran. Since Thailand Lishi Company secretly requested that factory cakes be imported fertilizers, attempting to indiscriminately levy additional fees, the public was outraged. The relevant industry groups in the local area argued nearby. At the same time, our association, based on the facts, telegraphed to stop it. On December 7 of the 21st year, the Finance Office's Bulletin No. 15, "Guangdong and other provinces' locally made bean bran, peanut bran, and other fertilizers are exempt from additional fees." The bright order is known to the whole country. By May of the 23rd year, the contractor, Huifeng Company, again secretly reported to the government that the raw materials for domestic bran were collected from the eastern provinces, and then the Zhongxing ship transported cake bran from Shanghai to Guangdong and was detained and donated. Our association collected the trademarks of cake bran manufactured by factories in Shanghai, Wuxi, Wu, Kun, and other places and submitted them to the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, the Guangdong Provincial Government, and the Finance Commissioner's Office to prove that Principal Zou of Sun Yat-sen University was in charge of correcting it. On that day, Principal Zou replied by telegram, "The Finance Office exempted the additional fees for bean cakes and raw bran. All those produced in the three northeastern provinces will be levied, and all those produced in the ten provinces will not be levied. The contractor has been ordered to comply with it, which is in line with the telegram." Telegrams were also successively received, stating, "The Political Affairs Committee reiterated today that no fees will be charged for bean bran that is not from the three northeastern provinces, and the levy will be reduced from eight cents to three cents." At the same time, the Shantou industry colleagues in Guangdong repeatedly petitioned the authorities, and Zhang Shaoxiong was commissioned by the Finance Office to jointly discuss the issue with Huang Peilun, a representative of Zhongda, and a representative of Huifeng Company. It was confirmed that the raw materials for domestic cake bran in various provinces were indeed not from the eastern provinces. The results of the discussion were submitted, and from then on, the bran sent to Guangdong was not produced in the three northeastern provinces and was exempt from additional fees. There are files for each case, but our association is aware that the donation merchants are greedy for money and may cause problems in the future. All the cake bran transported to Guangdong is reported by the association and issued with a certificate of approval and sent with the goods for certification. It is still handled as before. From May of last year to the present, the ink on the case has not dried up for a year, and the ashes of the levy have rekindled, and even intensified. In the past, the cake imported from the eastern provinces was levied at three cents per dan, but now it is levied at 25 cents. In the past, the cake transported from Tianjin, Qingdao, the Yangtze River, and Shanghai ports was not charged, but now it is levied at 25 cents uniformly. Recently, news was received from Guangdong that this additional fee will be implemented on September 1. It seems that this does not care about the law and does not care about the difficulties of the people. The vitality of the emerging oil factory, which is still in its infancy, will be cut off. Moreover, the Guangdong authorities are now implementing a three-year plan to abolish more than forty kinds of excessive taxes and levies because the people's power is exhausted. On the one hand, the cake bran, which is a fertilizer for farmers, is levied. How can it show credibility to the people of the country? How can the rural areas, which are on the verge of bankruptcy, bear the burden? This time, Guangdong Province implemented the levy of additional fees. All the factories, merchants, and customers in Shanghai, Hankou, Wuxi, Wu, Kun, and other places have achieved unanimous contact because they share weal and woe. It has been decided that from now on, the oil factory will stop work and the customers will stop transportation, and they will not hesitate to sacrifice everything and fight to the end. However, at present, the manufacturing companies and customers are suffering a major blow when industry and commerce are extremely declining. Unfortunately, the future can be imagined. It is hoped that everyone will express their sympathy and give enthusiastic support and publicity, so as to arouse public opinion and achieve the case that non-imported products are not subject to additional fees. It will be fortunate not only for our manufacturers, but also for the welfare of millions of farmers and workers.</p>

<p>Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Relief Committee, regarding the continued rise of the Huang River waters and the severity of the situation in northern Jiangsu, telegraphed Chen Guofu, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, on the 27th to express condolences. Yesterday, he received a reply telegram from Chen, which stated: "Respectfully to Chairman Xu Shiying, Jingren, of the Relief Committee, Renji Hall sends greetings. I have received and noted your esteemed telegram. The western dike of the Weishan Lake in northern Jiangsu has breached in several places, causing widespread flooding. We are currently rushing to protect and rescue the situation. Yesterday, I received an urgent telegram from Chairman Huang reporting that the flow of the Yellow River in Zhongmu, Henan, continues to rise to 5,500 cubic meters per second, far exceeding the capacity of the central canal to discharge. If the upstream continues to increase without end, then it will overflow and cause breaches, and the disaster in northern Jiangsu will inevitably become more serious day by day. You are deeply concerned about the hunger and drowning of the people, showing utmost care. I am deeply grateful for your consideration. As a responsible official, I have a duty to console and assist, and I must appeal for relief for the disaster victims. I hope to rely on your benevolence and receive your gracious assistance. I offer my sincere thanks in advance and hope you will consider this matter. Yours sincerely, Chen Guofu, on a propitious day."</p>

Witherspoon). Each service is attended by thousands, making it the largest worship gathering in the city. Many Chinese men and women also participate, listening to Chaplain Wei's preaching and enjoying the performances of the team's renowned music team. The team usually does not collect donations during these events, but at the worship service tomorrow (the 1st), a special fundraising event will be held. All proceeds will be used to provide relief to flood victims in China, demonstrating the sympathy of a friendly nation. The music program for tomorrow has been prepared by Mr. Li Yuanxin and is exceptionally wonderful. Mr. Luo Chuanhua will give a brief speech on "The Destruction of the Flood Disaster."

<h3>Maritime Labor Leader Yang Hu Gives Speech Regarding New Life Movement General Association's Tea Room Training Class</h3>
<p>The National Operated Merchant Shipping Bureau's Tea Room Training Class, organized by the New Life Movement General Association, opened the day before yesterday. Yesterday, maritime labor leader Yang Hu gave a speech, saying, "Since China opened its doors, it has been shaken by European and American influences, causing our inherent excellent culture to become increasingly obscure. In recent times, the general phenomena in society, namely, the eight characters 'lack of etiquette, forgetfulness of righteousness, little integrity, and scarcity of shame,' are sufficient to encompass the activities of the entire population. If the people are like this, and society is like this, how can the nation and country not be poor and weak and in trouble? Although the reasons for poverty and weakness are not limited to one aspect, it is undeniable that human efforts have been lacking. Therefore, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has promoted the New Life Movement, which has been met with widespread response. The future of the country is truly dependent on this. The so-called New Life Movement, its focus is actually on self-restraint. Only by correcting oneself can one correct others. Correcting oneself and correcting others both belong to human affairs. If a reasonable adjustment can be achieved in human affairs, society will definitely not be as chaotic and dark as it is today. The National Operated Merchant Shipping Bureau's Tea Room Training Class, organized by the New Life Movement General Association, is originally a start to rectify human affairs. The intention and method are both excellent, and I will do my best to assist it, so that our maritime workers can all become healthy citizens who are polite, abide by righteousness, are honest, and know shame. I have heard that there are those outside who are opposing it for no reason, which I am not happy to hear. As for those who say that the China Merchants Bureau is using the New Life Movement training as an opportunity to actually reduce workers, I think that at a time when the unemployment problem is becoming increasingly serious, social concerns are worrying, and the China Merchants Bureau should not do this."</p>
<h3>Lu Bohong and Others - Visited Zhang Qun Yesterday Morning - Zhang to Return to Hubei After Wife Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The New News Agency reports that Zhang Qun, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, received Huang Boqiao, Director of the Two-Road Bureau, at his residence at 8:00 a.m. yesterday morning for a discussion that lasted about an hour before he left. Inoue Kanichi, Manager of the Japanese-owned Tohwa Kogyo Trust Company, and Lu Bohong, General Manager of the Chinese-owned Electric Company, and others visited Zhang at his private residence one after another after Huang left, had discussions, and then departed. According to Zhang's aides to the New News Agency reporter, Madam Zhang originally planned to take the Nagasaki Maru to return from Japan, but due to the typhoon in Japan, it is still unknown whether the ship that Madam Zhang and others were on has departed. Therefore, Zhang plans to return to Beijing and then to Hubei after his wife returns to the country and arrives in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Special Price for Cotton Yarn and Piece Goods - Ministry Approves Extension for Another Year - Calculated from September 1st</h3>
<p>In order to facilitate cargo merchants and promote cargo transportation, the Railway Bureau, with the approval of the Ministry of Railways, has set a special price for the transportation of cotton yarn and cotton yarn piece goods on the Beijing-Shanghai Line, reducing it by 20% according to the original grade. If transported with a certificate from the Shanghai Chinese Cotton Mill Federation, it can be reduced by another 20%. As the special price is due to expire at the end of August this year, and the transportation performance of cotton yarn and cotton yarn piece goods has improved recently, a request has been submitted to the Ministry of Railways to extend the special price for another year from September 1st. This has been approved by the Ministry Order Ye Zi No. 7320.</p>
<h3>General Association of Marine Engineers Requests - Relief for Unemployed Seamen</h3>
<p>The Chinese General Association of Marine Engineers, recently, because many third engineers with certificates have become unemployed, which has a significant impact on their future livelihoods. In order to find a way out for unemployed seamen and to arrange positions for third engineers, the association has held multiple meetings. It has been decided to submit a request to the Ministry to instruct various shipping companies that for ships of 2,000 tons or more, marine artisans should temporarily be replaced by third engineers. Although this is using a great talent for a small job, it is also unavoidable. The submission is as follows: "Submitting a request to provide relief to third engineers to find a way out and avoid unemployment: Recently, members Lin Xiebin and others submitted a report stating that although members have passed the examination in accordance with the Ministry-promulgated Seafarer Examination Regulations and have obtained Class B third engineer certificates issued by the Ministry, they are still unable to find work and have been unemployed for a long time, which is painful to express. I implore the association to forward this to the Ministry for prompt relief in order to maintain their livelihoods, etc. Upon investigation, the matters stated by the members are indeed the actual situation. However, according to the Ministry's regulations, third engineers may only be employed on ships over 3,000 tons. However, the number of seafarers continuing to apply for third engineer certificates is endless, increasing without end, resulting in an oversupply. Looking ahead, I am deeply concerned. Under this deformed state, how will these third engineers be arranged? Moreover, the third engineer is the lowest rank among marine engineers, and it is even more difficult to provide relief for the unemployment problem than for other seafarers. If they are to serve beyond their rank, it is not permitted by law. If they are to change careers midway, it is difficult to bear from a human perspective. Even if they are to accept a lower rank and become marine artisans, according to Article 35, Section 2 of the Seafarer Examination Regulations, there is no hope of promotion for life. The association has repeatedly considered this and feels that it is difficult to advance or retreat, which has a significant impact on the future livelihoods of seafarers. Moreover, marine artisans are already abundant, and it is not easy to find a place. Even if there are vacancies, why must third engineers with certificates be hired? From this point of view, the third engineer certificate is like an unfulfilled check, with minimal utility, like waste paper, which was not anticipated by the Ministry when it initially drafted the law. However, although the problem is small, it is closely related to the credibility of the Ministry's laws and regulations. If relief is not sought urgently, not only will this local unemployment problem inevitably become more serious, but it will also overflow and collapse, and a small spark will start a prairie fire, which may be difficult to contain once it is triggered. The implications will cause the value of certificates to be negatively affected everywhere. The association believes that the matter concerns the livelihoods of seafarers and should not be ignored, and that it also has a great obstacle to the promotion of the entire shipping industry. After repeated consideration, I can only implore the Ministry to promptly investigate how many existing ships in China's rivers and seas are over 3,000 tons, and how many third engineers have received certificates over the years, and compare them with each other to understand clearly. If there is indeed an oversupply, there should be a comprehensive planning strategy for this situation of too few portions for too many monks. I propose to the Ministry to change the method and issue a clear order to all shipping companies in the country that for ships of 2,000 tons or more that only use marine artisans and do not have third engineers, the marine artisan positions should be uniformly replaced by third engineers, and the salary should still be paid as a marine artisan. However, there is priority in hiring. Only when the number of third engineers is not enough to distribute can marine artisans be used instead. This fundamental solution is also a necessary measure to provide relief to seafarers. Although it is known to be contrary to the Ministry's regulations, it can promote safety in Hangzhou transportation, and shipowners can also obtain technical assistance. It can not only seek a way out for seafarers, but also add a guarantee to the Ministry's certificates, achieving multiple benefits in one stroke. I respectfully submit my humble opinion and await adoption. Is this appropriate? I respectfully request a prompt order for implementation, without allowing for any hesitation. I respectfully submit to Zhu, Minister of Transportation."</p>

<h3>Shanghai Lawyers Association - Prepares to Open National Lawyers Representative Conference</h3>
<p>The Lawyers Association of the Republic of China convened its sixth representative conference in Guangdong last year and resolved that the seventh conference this year would be held in Shanghai. The association has now scheduled the national lawyers representative conference to be held in Shanghai for one week starting on September 23rd of this year. At that time, the lawyers associations of all provinces in the country must elect representatives to gather in Shanghai. However, matters of preparation have already been discussed and agreed upon with the Shanghai Lawyers Association to be responsible for preparation. The initial planned location for the meeting was the Shanghai Lawyers Association at No. 572 on the corner of Rue Beille and Avenue LaFayette in the French Concession, as the meeting place. Because the association does not have a conference hall, it has now been discussed and the Chinese Cultural and Artistic Society on Rue Pere Robert, at the end of Avenue Haig, in the French Concession has been selected for the event. In addition to notifying the lawyers associations of all provinces to elect representatives as soon as possible, a preparatory committee will also be organized in Shanghai in conjunction with the Shanghai Lawyers Association. Notices have already been sent to the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Railways, and other ministries, instructing the railway bureaus and other departments to follow the usual practice, review and approve the representatives' preferential travel certificates, so that representatives from all provinces can gather in Shanghai on time to hold the meeting.</p>

<h3>Private Drug-Making Operation Uncovered in Taoyuanfang After Someone Jumps from Building - Reason for Luo Zhaoxiu's Jump Still Under Investigation - 26 Types of Red Pill-Making Equipment Seized</h3>
<p>At approximately 5 a.m. the other morning, a person suddenly jumped from the carpentry workshop on the upper floor of No. 165 Taoyuanfang, North Jiangxi Road, injuring their buttocks. Tang Fuxiang, an apprentice in the workshop, saw this and reported it to the Chinese Constable on duty at post No. 1894. An ambulance was summoned and the person was sent to Tongren Hospital. It was learned that the person was named Luo Zhaoxiu, also known as A'er, from Taizhou. When asked why this happened, the person refused to say. The person was admitted to the hospital for treatment. Later, the second landlord, Zhu Mao, learned of this and went to investigate. Seeing that the room door was closed, he knew that there were illegal items inside, so he and Chinese Constables No. 1283 and others went upstairs, opened the door, and seized a handbag containing up to 26 kinds of equipment for making the drug "red pills," as well as tens of thousands of drug pills. They telegraphed the Hongkou Police Station, which sent Chinese and foreign detectives to rush to the scene. They continued to seize a Hangzhou woman named Pang Li, who had rented a room in the alley. After waiting for a while, a Cantonese man named Yang Renchu arrived and was also arrested. Together with the evidence, they were all taken to the police station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, the three men and women, including the Luo criminal, who had recovered in the hospital, were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Lawyer Wang Yaotang of the Shanghai Municipal Council detailed the previous circumstances and stated that the identity of the boss of the operation had not been determined and requested an extension of time. Subsequently, the detectives reported the details of the investigation and presented the evidence. The second landlord, Zhu Mao, a local, stated that he ran a machine factory at No. 155 Qipu Road. The ground floor of the premises was sublet to a carpentry workshop, and the room upstairs was rented from him by the defendant Pang Li at the end of last year for a monthly rent of 25 yuan, which was collected by the accountant Yang Zhaoxian. He did not know that she was secretly making red pills upstairs. According to Yang, he went to collect the rent every month, and the door was closed. He had to knock on the door to notify her, and Pang Li would pay the rent. The rental agreement was in the name of Liu Haiqing. According to apprentice Tang Fuxiang, he was cooking breakfast at the time when he suddenly saw the defendant Luo Zhaoxiu jump from the upper floor and fall to the ground. He did not know what had happened and immediately reported it to the Chinese Constables. When questioned, the defendants' statements were evasive. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered that they be returned to custody separately and rescheduled for investigation and verification.</p>

<h3>French Concession Lumber Industry Hygiene Donation - Forced to Endure the Pain of Donating</h3>
<p>The New News Agency reports that various lumber businesses in the French Concession of this city were suddenly notified by the French Municipal Council to obtain classified business hygiene licenses and pay an inspection fee of 2 yuan or 10 yuan. The businesses, having been in operation for many years and never having paid such a donation, found the content of the donation harsh and difficult to accept, and therefore unanimously opposed it. They had written to the trade association to forward a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce requesting the municipal government to stop it, and had also written to the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association requesting the French authorities to abolish it. It is now learned that detectives from the French Police Station suddenly sent letters to various lumber firms, such as Tongxing, Chengda, Fuxing, and Lida, to go to the French Police Station for questioning. The foreign detective chief advised the lumber firms to donate for the licenses. The lumber firms replied with reason, but to no avail. The foreign detective chief then sent police to take the firms to the Municipal Council to donate for the licenses. The firms, forced by the circumstances, had no choice but to endure the pain of donating for the licenses. It is said that the lumber firms will report the situation of this forced donation to various agencies and groups to request assistance.</p>

<h3>Vicious Daughter-in-Law Beats Mother-in-Law - Taken to District Court for Interrogation</h3>
<p>Yang Zhang, a woman from Chengjiaqiao Dajin Township in the Pusong District, is nearing sixty years of age. Because she had no son, she adopted her nephew, Fuyi, as her son in the past. Two years ago, for Fuyi she married a woman with the surname Gao, Gao. At the beginning of her marriage, Gao was considered filial. Yang Zhang was pleased and thought that she was about to die, so she took out all the property deeds, such as land deeds and house deeds, and handed them over to Gao for safekeeping, entrusting all family affairs to her daughter-in-law. Unexpectedly, after Gao took over, she suddenly changed her behavior. She treated her mother-in-law like a servant on weekdays, scolding indirectly and making the family restless. Yang Zhang, because of an urgent need, asked her daughter-in-law Gao to take out a land deed in order to mortgage it for some money. Unexpectedly, Gao slapped her in the face, tore her lip, and caused her to bleed profusely, shouting for help. Neighbors gathered and learned the situation. The crowd felt injustice on her behalf and reported it to the Chengjiaqiao Police Station. The inspector, Zhu Dingzhang, sent police to arrest Yang Gao. According to Yang Zhang's confession of being beaten, Gao's denial was absurd. Yang Zhang was ordered to return to her home for treatment, while a document was prepared to send Yang Gao to the Public Security Bureau, who transferred her to the District Court for interrogation and legal action yesterday.</p>
<h3>Jiangbei Bandit Leader - Jie Pengfei Approved for Transfer - Zhenjiang Garrison Headquarters Submitted Official Document - Bandit Has Gunshot Scar on Right Leg</h3>
<p>Jie Pengfei, also known as Jie Wu and Lian Sheng, a Jiangbei bandit from Moyang, is forty-one years old this year. He repeatedly committed major cases of banditry, kidnapping, arson, and murder in the territory of Haizhou Donghai County. The Donghai County Government offered a reward for his arrest. Because Jie could not stand in the Jiangbei area, he fled to Shanghai. The Zhenjiang Garrison Headquarters received a confidential report from informants, learning that Jie was hiding at No. 70, Qian Tan Residence, Xinxiao West, Nanshi, Huajie. Therefore, they sent Cai Zhaofeng, director of the special affairs team, along with special affairs officers Shao Shike, service officer Shao Hanzhang, to Shanghai, and Shanghai Public Security Bureau detectives to arrest him. Jie had heard the news and moved away. After investigation, it was learned that Jie had moved to No. 310, Avenue LaFayette, in the French Concession. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 27th, they reported to the French Police Station and requested them to send detectives Lu Zhulin and Bao Detective Liu Jinrong to rush to the address to arrest Jie. He was taken back to the police station. The next day, Jie was escorted to the Second Special Court, where Judge Wang Gangxu opened a hearing. Jie denied being a thief, and the Police Department opposed the transfer because the Zhenjiang Garrison Headquarters had not provided evidence. The court ruled to detain him pending investigation and verification. The details were recorded in the previous report. Currently, the police station has sent detectives to investigate and confirmed that Jie did live in the Dan Residence in Xinxiaotou. Yesterday morning, Judge Wang of the Second Special Court came to the First Criminal Court to continue the interrogation. He questioned Jie again, and Jie still denied being a thief, saying that he had three brothers and was not called Jie Wu. Then, Jie's concubine, Ms. Huang (29 years old, from Jiangbei), was summoned to court and testified that they had lived at No. 70 Tan Residence. The Zhenjiang Garrison Headquarters also presented the Donghai County Government's wanted notice and telegram to the court. French Police Station Detective Lu Zhulin reported that Jie's right leg had a gunshot scar. After the court reviewed the evidence, it ruled that Jie Pengfei, also known as Jie Wu, was approved to be handed over to the Zhenjiang Garrison Headquarters personnel for interrogation.</p>

They confiscated twenty inferior "double corner" coins and took him to the police station. Yao confessed that he had purchased the counterfeit coins from Hongxing Bank at No. 110 North Hai Road. He could exchange one silver dollar for 13 to 15 "double corner" coins, but he had to use the code "Guang San" to make the purchase. The detectives then used two marked banknotes, escorted Yao to the bank, and successfully purchased thirty inferior "double corner" coins. The detectives then searched the premises and found 2,985 such "double corner" coins upstairs. They took the bank employees Gu Yungeng, Jin Bingkun, Lu Shirong, Lu Bohua, and Xu Chengshi to the police station.

Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division One. The police lawyer Jiang Baoqing explained the situation and requested an extension, stating that the police needed to continue their investigation. Subsequently, the detective in charge of the case submitted a report detailing the circumstances of the arrest and stating that the counterfeit coins had been examined by employees of a certain bank at No. 119 Guizhou Road, who said that the "double corner" coins were not generally accepted in the market.

<h3>Robbery on Route Doumer; Bandit Shoots Victim</h3>
<p>Shen Mulin, a 37-year-old local resident living at No. 22, Lane 133 on Route Doumer in the French Concession, was hardworking and frugal, and his family was well-off, which attracted the attention of robbers. At about 9 o'clock last night, four strangers suddenly broke into his house, claiming to be asking for directions. They lingered and refused to leave. Shen happened to be home and, realizing that they were not good people, shouted for robbers. The thugs panicked, fearing the police would arrive, and quickly walked out. However, one of the robbers at the rear, unable to control his anger, turned around and fired two warning shots. One shot missed, but the other hit Shen's left arm, with the bullet passing through. As the stray bullet flew, it grazed the head of his relative, Zhang (72 years old), causing only a minor injury. After the robbers fled, they reported the incident to the Lujiawan Police Station, which sent detectives to investigate. Shen was then taken by car to Guangru Hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3>Ye Zhongfang's Nature Hard to Change; Beats a Guard in Prison; Dissatisfied with Eating Soybeans, Ye Actually Assaults the Guard</h3>
<p>Ye Zhongfang, grandson of the late Ningbo Zhenhai native Ji Chengzhong, nicknamed "Little Shaker," was sued for divorce by his wife, Chen Yinglan, in the Second Special District Court. After three trials, the court ruled in favor of the divorce and ordered Ye to pay 60,000 yuan in alimony. The Second Special District Court enforced the judgment in accordance with the law. Because Ye refused to appear in court, the court sent officials to detain Ye in June and enforce the judgment, and he has been detained for more than two months. Because all of his property has been exhausted, he has not paid a single penny. Ye is detained in Room 3 of the civil detention department of the Second Special District Court's detention center. His addictions have been quit. His concubine, Lu Xiaomei, a local, brings food and delicacies to the detention center every morning to visit him. Therefore, Ye is more spirited than before and is content. He sits at the south window, writing articles, which he occasionally sends to small newspapers for publication. However, his shaking nature has not changed in detention. Yesterday morning at about 7 AM, he suddenly started shaking violently in the detention center because he was dissatisfied with the soybeans that Zhejiang native Shi Zemin, a guard, distributed with the congee, which led to a verbal dispute. Ye actually punched Shi in the right cheek, causing Shi's eyelid to be scratched by his fingers. After the guards stopped him, Shi immediately reported the incident to the warden, who investigated and ordered Ye to be sent to the Second Special District Court's Procuratorate for investigation. At noon, Prosecutor Wang Ren and Clerk Zhao Yifen took their seats in Criminal Division Five and ordered Ye Zhongfang to be brought to the court for investigation. Ye was wearing a blue cloth long gown, was bald and barefoot, wearing slippers, with glasses on his nose and a short mustache on his upper lip. He had a plaster on his left cheek and looked exhausted. Presumably, he has been ill in detention recently. His concubine, Lu Xiaomei, who had come to the detention center in the morning to visit him, heard the news and waited, and she also came to the court to listen quietly. The court first interrogated Ye Zhongfang, 27 years old, from Zhenhai, who used to study and lived at No. 22, Lane 269, Carter Road, and is now unemployed. He is being detained in the detention center for an alimony case related to his divorce. Then, the official summoned the plaintiff Shi Zemin to testify, 49 years old, from Zhejiang, who is a guard at the detention center, living inside. Today morning at about 7 AM, I went upstairs to distribute congee. Ye was standing at the door of Room 3, complaining that the soybeans were too hard and he couldn't eat them. He wanted me to change them for tender ones. I replied that they were all the same. He immediately punched me in the face, causing my eyelid to be scratched by his fingers. The guards pulled him away. He then used a broom to hit my right shoulder and behind my shoulder once each. I have no grievances with him. However, he usually asks me to buy cigarettes, which I have not allowed. The official asked if Ye denied the assault. Ye denied the assault, stating that Shi and another detainee, Guo Yongji, were arguing about soybeans, and I went to dissuade them. I have had a fever for six days and was sleeping in bed. How could I hit anyone? Besides, I don't eat soybeans, so what does it matter to me if they are hard or tender? The plaintiff Shi Zemin denied arguing with the person named Guo and stated that Ye loses his temper in the detention center, and even if the dishes sent from home are not to his liking. Of course, he won't eat soybeans. He deliberately makes trouble for the authorities. Prosecutor Wang verified the testimonies and ordered Shi Zemin to go to the Forensic Medical Office to examine the injuries. Ye Shenfang was returned to custody to await further verification and then adjourned the court.</p>

<h3>Labor Representatives from Two Railways Petitioned Yesterday to Be Exempted from Physical Examinations; Director Huang Explained that There Was Absolutely No Intention to Eliminate Workers</h3>
<p>Following the release of a notice by the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau announcing periodic physical examinations for employees, rumors immediately spread among all railway workers, causing widespread panic and unease. For days, workers have been requesting meetings of various branch unions to discuss relief measures. On the 29th, representatives from the Nanjing branch, Changzhou branch, Upper North branch, and Upper South branch of the railway union petitioned the management bureau. Director Huang personally met with the representatives and explained the meaning of the physical examinations in detail. He vehemently stated that there was absolutely no intention to eliminate workers and urged all workers to continue working with peace of mind. The representatives returned to their respective branches to relay the message to the workers, but they all considered it empty talk and felt that there was no guarantee. They have now unanimously decided to proceed based on the reasons presented to the Party headquarters and the Labor and Sanitation Department of the two railways: (1) When workers joined the railways, they had already undergone thorough medical examinations before being hired. They work hard for eight or nine hours every day and have served for decades, enduring the harshness of the weather. It is natural for the strong to become weak and the young to become old. Moreover, workers must undergo rigorous examinations every time they are promoted, and even slight deficiencies result in disqualification. (2) The workers' health has deteriorated due to their service. The bureau should show extra compassion, rather than resorting to suspension. Although some may be old and frail, they do not make mistakes in their work and should be supported. (3) The two railways have suffered repeatedly from warfare, especially during the sudden outbreak of the January 28th Incident. Workers risked their lives under gunfire to maintain railway property, saving countless assets. Within days of the signing of the ceasefire agreement, full traffic was restored, demonstrating the workers' diligent service. The bureau should consider this and continue to exempt them from examinations to ensure their security.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Jiangwan Teng Peifu Kindergarten</h3>
<p>The Jiangwan Teng Peifu Kindergarten is one of the most successful emerging institutions of its kind in Shanghai. It was founded last summer and is managed by Mrs. Guo Bingwen and Ms. Sang Wenlan. The kindergarten is located on Teng Pei Road in Jiangwan, across from the Shanghai Animal Husbandry Milk Company, in an open area with fresh air. The kindergarten building was specifically designed for childcare purposes, featuring an elegant building divided into children's classrooms, playrooms, dining halls, bedrooms, bathrooms, washrooms, nanny rooms, offices, and staff rooms, all well-equipped, clean, and beautiful. The grounds are covered with grass, planted with flowers and trees, and equipped with various play and exercise equipment. The kindergarten is divided into two sections: a kindergarten section for children aged four to five, and a primary school section for children aged six to ten. The organizational structure includes Mrs. Guo as the principal, Ms. Sang as the vice-principal, Ms. Cao as a teacher, and two nannies. The kindergarten's main achievements are in health, care, and life management. Ms. Sang is the full-time person in charge. Since the Guangli era (early years of the Republic), she has served in education in Hangzhou, Nanjing, Beijing, Shanghai, and Yunnan, known for her competence, diligence, kindness, and consideration. Therefore, everything in the kindergarten is well-organized, and she treats other people's children as her own, with extensive experience in childcare and medicine. As a result, the twenty or so children entrusted to the kindergarten in the past year have all been healthy, plump, clean, and lively, earning the trust of their parents. When the kindergarten was founded, it originally had a charitable nature, intending to accommodate children orphaned after the January 28th Incident and years of flooding. However, because almost all those admitted were children of intellectuals, the nature of the kindergarten was changed to meet the needs of couples who both work and are unable to care for their children. Currently, the kindergarten charges 54 yuan per student per semester, including tuition, board, lodging, and miscellaneous expenses. By Shanghai standards, this barely covers expenses. However, thanks to Mrs. Guo Bingwen's efforts in fundraising, the kindergarten spent 2,000 yuan in start-up costs and 1,500 yuan in recurring expenses last year, in addition to the 11,500 yuan spent on the building. Therefore, the kindergarten differs in nature from general commercial schools in Shanghai and is entirely dedicated to social service. Last year, as a trial, it only admitted twenty children. This year, due to the successful trial, it plans to expand to thirty students, with ten vacancies remaining. If gentlemen and ladies have children in need, they can contact the kindergarten. Children in the Jiangwan city center area can also attend as day students. The kindergarten is now in session and welcomes visits and guidance from early childhood education experts and the public. At the beginning of this children's year, the kindergarten's contribution is well worth the reference and study of educators.</p>

<p>Having recently read today's (30th) newspapers, I was astonished by the new column stating that Cai Langsheng, the leader of the defense corps, tied up Zhuang Dingyou and dragged him to the nearby Chenjia Ancestral Hall (the site of the former defense post), where he was subjected to private torture by hanging, witnessed by the police officer of the Longhua sub-station. Most of the story about releasing Zhuang Dingyou is fabricated to mislead the public. After investigation, it was found that the patrol officer Liu Songjian sent a senior policeman to the scene. While walking to the Longhua Railway Station, about a li away from the Chenjia Ancestral Hall, he met Cai Langsheng and a member of the corps, Chen Mingxin, who were about to take a group of offenders to the corps for questioning. Unexpectedly, the senior policeman and others, without asking the reason, forcibly stopped the offenders. Cai Langsheng argued that the procedure required the corps to question them first and then transfer them to the sub-station with a written document. Therefore, he argued reasonably, leading to a quarrel. The senior policeman and others, relying on their numbers, immediately punched and kicked Cai Langsheng and Chen Mingxin, the member of the corps, in front of many witnesses, including shopkeepers. After the beating, the policeman threw the leader and the corps members into the sub-station as well. As for tying up Zhuang Dingyou with rope, that was indeed the case. Because the offender Zhuang Dingyou was strong and carried a small knife about six inches long, the rope was used to prevent him from using the knife to commit violence, which is a necessary precaution when capturing offenders and not illegal. As for private torture by hanging, it is entirely fabricated. The defense corps handles civil disputes to assist the police where their strength is insufficient. If they can be resolved through reconciliation, they are resolved. Otherwise, they are transferred to the nearest public security bureau for handling. They have never used torture on offenders. This is a fact of the past, well known to local people. Furthermore, the story that twelve jiao were taken from Zhuang Dingyou is even more ridiculous. Although the members of the defense corps are volunteers, they all have legitimate occupations and do not make a living by robbery. There is no need to dwell on this. The matter concerns the reputation of the entire defense corps. In addition to making further representations, I am writing to request that you disclose the truth and correct the report. Sincerely, The First Team of the Caojing District Defense Corps of Shanghai, August 30.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, The news item in your newspaper on the 27th of this month, "Social Bureau Bans Illegal Fee Collection by Cooked Water Guild," contains some misunderstandings. I am writing to explain the situation and respectfully request that your newspaper uphold justice and correct the report to avoid serious damage to the reputation of our guild. Our guild's expenses are not paid because so many membership fees are owed, and it doesn't have the funds to send water ladles. So, the executive committee meeting resolved to collect six jiao for the cost of the water ladle and two jiao for the membership certificate, which was submitted to the Social Bureau for record. In early August, it was implemented and delivered, and soon the guild complied with the Social Bureau's order to change it and not charge any fees for the water ladle. Instead, it collected two yuan in membership fees to maintain the society. It has debts more than a year old, and can't avoid collecting that money. It happened that a rogue in Nanshi fabricated charges, and our guild has already filed a lawsuit with the court to investigate and prosecute it. In short, our guild has not violated any laws. The facts are all there. I respectfully wish your editor peace. Sincerely, Shanghai Cooked Water Shop Industry Guild.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, Having recently read the news item in your newspaper on the 30th of this month, "The Turmoil of Huafeng's Dismissal Dispute: Worker Dies after Being Seriously Injured, Lawsuit Entrusts Lawyer to Accuse Ye Shantao of Masterminding the Incident," that the worker Yao Tianfu died of exposure for two nights and beatings yesterday morning, after investigation, it was found that the deceased Yao Tianfu was from Haining and lived in the factory. He suffered from carbuncles and had been dead for several days, as evidenced by the prescription of Doctor Dang Jingbo. After the death of the patient, his brother-in-law Zhu collected the body and put it in the Haichang Public Office. The facts are all there and have nothing to do with the labor dispute. The report in your newspaper that I, Ye Shantao, masterminded the injury and death is inconsistent with the facts. In order to clarify the truth, I am writing to request that your newspaper disclose the truth and correct the report. Sincerely, Ye Shantao, August 30. Kun Yi's business is in Shanghai, and he is accustomed to leaving early and returning late. He has been running along the Shanghai-Nanjing Road for decades, and he has been taught several lessons by pickpockets and thieves. But being framed for profit is a new experience. A few days ago, when I returned to my hometown from Shanghai, I found a package of opium ash, weighing about three qian, in my pocket. I was surprised and wondered where this thing came from. After thinking carefully, I realized that when I was taking the No. 5 tram on Nanjing Road, a group of three people bought tickets and called for the North Station. Perhaps at this time, someone took the opportunity to plant it on me, so that when we got off at the North Station, they could report to the police and get a reward for providing information. Fortunately, we sat in a car and did not enter the North Station. Otherwise, I would have been unjustly accused and become a fish in the net. The world is dangerous, and people are sinister. False accusations and extortion are emerging endlessly. Therefore, I am writing to inform travelers to be vigilant. If your editor can publish this in the newspaper, it will be a great merit. Sincerely, Gu Kunyi.</p>

<h3>National Free Education Association to Hold a Meeting Today to Discuss Six Items</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 30th) The National Free Education Committee will hold a meeting at the Ministry of Education on the morning of the 31st. The six items to be discussed are: 1. Electing three standing committee members; 2. Experimenting with short-term elementary school curriculum standards and textbooks; 3. Methods for dividing elementary school districts in various provinces and cities; 4. Methods for investigating school-age children; 5. Methods for rewarding and punishing county magistrates for promoting free education; 6. Free education inspection issues.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Instructs Improvement of Public and Private Universities in Sichuan</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued an instruction on the 30th to public and private universities in Sichuan to earnestly improve, with the text as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Instruction to National Sichuan University, briefly stating: "The Ministry has previously sent personnel to inspect the school. According to the submitted report, after further review, in addition to the changes in the organization of departments and the abolition of affiliated schools, which were previously instructed by telegram, the main points are now presented as follows. You are to comply with them and earnestly improve, and submit a report for review and approval. 1. The organization of the school's departments should be reorganized according to the following points: (1) The departments of the College of Liberal Arts should be handled according to the current situation. After the Chongqing University College of Liberal Arts students have been identified and approved, they should be merged into the college. However, after checking, the Education Department's second-year class has only one student, who should be instructed to transfer to another department or find a way to transfer schools. (2) The Department of Physics and the Department of Mathematics in the College of Science have few students. The school should decide whether to merge them into a Department of Mathematics and Physics and must quickly seek to enrich the teaching staff and equipment. (3) The classes of the Department of Political Science and the Department of Economics in the College of Law are incomplete. If the number of students in the original classes is too small, they should be merged into a Department of Political Science and Economics. (4) The addition of the College of Agriculture, temporarily set up one or two departments. The details are to be determined by the school and reported to the Ministry for approval. After the students of the Provincial Agricultural College and the students of the Department of Agronomy and Chemistry of Chongqing University have been identified and approved, they should be merged into the college. Those who have no classes to enter may adopt borrowing or other appropriate methods. The college should do its best to enrich itself this year and temporarily determine enrollment. 2. The school's funding should be properly allocated to determine the proportion of each college. As for the purchase costs, the proportion occupied in the past was too small, resulting in simple equipment. In the future, efforts should be made to increase the amount to no less than 15% of the total funding, to be used as much as possible to expand equipment, and the College of Agriculture should pay special attention to enrichment. 3. The school's courses are mostly set up for individuals, without a fixed standard. The teaching materials used are estimated to be more than 150 types, costing 30,000 yuan per year. Teaching is mainly based on lectures, and students' tax rates are greatly reduced. In the future, a proper curriculum should be established and implemented effectively. 4. The original teaching duties of the school's faculty should be reassigned by the school's new principal after taking office, considering the circumstances, to facilitate reform. The order is issued to comply with and earnestly improve the report."</p>
<p>(2) Instruction to Private Huachun Association University, briefly stating: "The Ministry has previously sent personnel to inspect the school. According to the submitted report, after further review, the school's operations have a solid foundation, and the achievements of the medical and dental departments are particularly remarkable, which is commendable. However, the following points still need to be improved: 1. The College of Arts and Sciences has too many departments, but the number of students is very small. The school should draft a plan to cut and merge departments and submit it to the Ministry for approval. 2. The lectures designated by various established groups in the school fail to fully meet the needs of the school, and there are also courses that should be set up but do not have suitable teachers. The school president should be responsible for consulting with the board of directors to discuss appropriate improvement measures. As for the courses left behind during the faculty's vacations, efforts should be made to invite people to teach on their behalf to emphasize students' studies. 3. The school's faculty treatment should be based on qualifications. The current treatment of Chinese faculty is too low and should be improved immediately. 4. The school's administrative meeting should be reorganized in accordance with the current regulations of the University Organization Law, and professors and associate professors should elect representatives to attend. The order is issued to comply with and earnestly improve the report."</p>

<h3>Japanese Residents' Group Asks the Municipal Council to Increase Subsidies for Japanese Schools.</h3>
<p>The Foreign Affairs Negotiation Committee of the Japanese Residents' Group in the city held a meeting the day before yesterday to discuss the issue of subsidies from the Municipal Council to American businesses. As a result, it was planned to request the Council to increase the subsidies appropriately. The reason given was that the Municipal Council's budget for this year provided an annual subsidy of 1,061,470 yuan for Chinese schools and 833,380 yuan for foreign schools. There are approximately 5,800 Chinese students and approximately 1,600 foreign students. The average amount per person is more than 520 yuan for foreigners and 183 yuan for Chinese. However, the schools set up by the Japanese Residents' Group have a total of approximately 4,000 faculty and students, and the Municipal Council only subsidized 128,000 yuan in the first half of the year, averaging just over 30 yuan per person. Therefore, it is considered that there is still room for an increase.</p>

<h3>The Venue for the National Games has been Handed Over Yesterday. The Organizing Committee will Begin to Arrange the Venue and Equipment. There are Rumors that the Swimming Pool will Open on September 8th.</h3>
<p>The construction of various projects at the Shanghai Grand Sports Stadium has been completed. The Municipal Government specially sent staff to hand over the sports stadium, gymnasium, and swimming pool to the Organizing Committee of the National Games yesterday. The committee specially sent Guo Yongxi, Jiang Xueqi, and Xie Guanshi to handle the handover. The gymnasium was received first at 10:00 AM last year, followed by the swimming pool, and the sports stadium was received in the afternoon. The handover was completed at 3:00 PM. The organizing committee is now preparing to arrange various equipment at the venue. The swimming pool was originally scheduled to open on August 24th, but it was postponed to September 1st due to the unfinished construction. It is now rumored that it will still be difficult to open on September 1st and has been rescheduled to open on September 8th, opening for one month. However, whether this is true remains to be verified. A reporter from Shanghai News Agency went to visit yesterday and saw that the scale of each construction project is grand and the equipment is perfect, worthy of being the best in the Far East. The general situation is divided as follows:</p>
<p>Sports Stadium: The area is 37,500 square meters. The stands around the stadium look like a city wall from a distance, extremely majestic. The stadium is 175 meters wide and 330 meters long, with a stand height of 10 meters and a seating capacity of 60,000 people. The center is the field event field and the football, volleyball, and national arts field. The grass has been laid. The surrounding track is 500 meters long and has also been completed. Only the ground outside the track is still being organized. Under the stands are the athletes' dormitory, temporary shopping mall, public restrooms, ticket offices, etc. The dormitory can accommodate 2,500 people, and the corridors are wide and easy to enter and exit. Other facilities such as rest rooms, offices, exhibition rooms, information desks, wireless broadcasting stations, and dining rooms are all available. There are large gates on the east and west sides of the stadium, with special stands above, specially for VIPs and newspaper reporters. There are also 20 telephones set up in the reporters' backstage for rent by various newspapers.</p>
<p>Gymnasium: Entering from the main entrance is the lobby, with ticket offices on both sides. Further in is the hall, with male and female restrooms on both sides, and stairs leading to the stands. Further in is the foyer, which leads directly to the sports hall and the fitness room, and next to the office and reception room. On both sides of the hall are the male and female athletes' changing rooms and shower rooms. The entire hall can accommodate 3,500 seats and 1,500 standing places. The hall is 23 meters wide and 40 meters long and can accommodate three ordinary basketball courts. During formal competitions, only a larger court is set up in the center. The white iron basketball stand is different from the ordinary ones. There are 48 electric lights installed at a high level. Because the four walls are white, the light is quite bright. Heating equipment is also available.</p>
<p>Swimming Pool: It can accommodate 5,000 to 6,000 spectators. Under the stands are separate male and female athletes' changing rooms and shower rooms. The pool is 50 meters long and 20 meters wide, with a shallow end of 1.24 meters and a deepest end of 3.38 meters. At the end is a diving platform and two diving [Platforms]. At the other end, there is a simple children's swimming pool. There are a total of 30 wall lamps in the pool. The water capacity is 600,000 gallons. The water filtration equipment is especially complete. There are three large water filtration pots. When dirty water enters the pot, it is first disinfected with soda and alum, then filtered in the pot, and then returned to the pool. The pool water is always clean without needing to be changed. It is the latest style of swimming pool.</p>

<h3>Little Men (30) (1)</h3>
<p>— Original by Ms. Louisa May Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang (Zonghai)</p>
<p>Another beneficial thing, but I don't know how it came about as if blown by a good wind for no reason. Several of the children are "doing business"—this is how they say it—because most come from poor families. Mr. and Mrs. Bhaer know that they will soon have to support themselves, so they encourage all kinds of efforts to become self-reliant. Tommy sells his eggs; Jack speculates in the livestock business; Franz helps with teaching and also gets a little tuition; Nat loves woodworking, so a lathe was set up for him. He used it to make many useful and beautiful things, which he sells; Little Joe builds small wheels "Wiggle-Waggle," (a kind of top,) and all kinds of useless but mysterious machines of various types that cannot be named. He also sells these to the other children.</p>
<p>"Let him be a mechanic, if he likes," Mr. Bhaer said. "Give each child a kind of trade, then he can be self-reliant. Work is beneficial to the body and mind, so no matter what talents these children have—whether it is poetry or farming—they must be cultivated, and if possible, be made into useful villagers."</p>
<p>One day, Ned ran in anxiously and hurriedly asked:</p>
<p>"A group of people in the forest are having a picnic. They invited me to play the piano for them. Can I go? They will give me a little money. I want to earn some money like the other children. Playing the piano is my only way to get money."</p>
<p>Mr. Bhaer immediately replied:</p>
<p>"Go, I am very happy to see this news. This is a pleasant and easy job for you. I am very happy to hear that they have given you this opportunity."</p>

<h3>YMCA Sponsored Men's and Women's Volleyball Disaster Relief Competition to be Held at 8 PM Tonight at the Sichuan Road YMCA Gymnasium. Tickets are Divided into 1 Yuan and 50 Cents. Advance Purchase is Enthusiastic.</h3>
<p>In view of the severe disaster situation in various provinces, the Sichuan Road YMCA has specially invited first-class men's and women's volleyball players attending the National Games to hold a volleyball disaster relief charity competition. It has been decided to open at 8 PM tonight at the Sichuan Road YMCA Gymnasium. Tickets are divided into 1 yuan and 50 cents. The details are divided as follows:</p>
<p>Wonderful Performance, A Rare Opportunity: The YMCA is hosting this charity competition in light of the fact that the people are starving and the sports community cannot sit idly by. They have specially invited first-class men's and women's volleyball players. The list was announced the day before yesterday. The YMCA has put a lot of effort into this invitation. The players are scattered all over the place, and after tireless efforts by Committee Member Ling Xitao, they were finally able to get everyone to agree to participate. This kind of competition, in addition to being able to admire it at the National Games in the future, is rarely encountered at ordinary times. Each player's skills are at a high level. It is expected that tonight's battle will be wonderful and compact. Those who are interested in volleyball should not miss this opportunity.</p>
<p>All Ticket Proceeds to be Used for Disaster Relief: Tonight's tickets are divided into 1 yuan and 50 cents. They are sold at both the Sichuan Road and Baxianqiao YMCAs. Sales started the day before yesterday, and there have been quite a few pre-purchases from the YMCA yesterday. It is hoped that you will reserve them as soon as possible to avoid missing out. The YMCA will use all the proceeds from the tickets for disaster relief, and all expenses will be paid by the YMCA to avoid anyone using the name of charity to enrich their own pockets.

<h3>Financial Foreign Exchange Soars, Gold Price Suddenly Rises, Momentum Lacks Longevity, Popularity Still Good, Result Continues to Rise Nine Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was stirred by the National Products Bank and other institutions' efforts to purchase foreign exchange, causing the price to rise. Some people predicted that it would approach 900 yuan, but unexpectedly, foreign banks' willingness to sell remained strong, and buyers unloaded their holdings, stopping the rising trend. Early in the morning, the overseas silver market saw British and American markets both flat, with Montelieri's forward silver price rising by 3 li and shrinking by 4 li. Exchange rates slightly contracted, and London spot gold rose by half a penny. People's hearts were still stable, and the pre-market trading opened, rising to 878 yuan. Richang, Dadecheng, Huixiang, and Hengyu sold high and retreated to 6 yuan. Huixiang, Fuxing, and Yong took advantage of the low prices to maintain the price, rising to 7 yuan. After opening, the market became idle. The Central Bank's listed prices were announced, with both British and American currencies flat and the customs gold unit unchanged. The listed standard price for gold was 923.5 yuan, and people's hearts were very calm. The market situation was extremely quiet. It was known that the HSBC Bank's listed prices also showed British and American currencies flat. At this time, sellers were strong, and the price once fell. However, due to the tightening of the foreign exchange market, buyers were still active, and the price soon rebounded. Although the Central Bank sold, general banks were happy to purchase and push up the price. However, due to HSBC selling British currency and MacCallum selling American currency, there was still much fluctuation. Finally, due to large buyers' purchases and the National Products Bank's purchases, the price broke through the 90 yuan mark. A rumor arose in the market that the Central Bank was opening for cash, and the price rose. Banks took advantage of the high price to sell. After the rise, the price stabilized for a while. The Hong Kong market weakened, and the Indian silver forecast fell by two annas. Large buyers continued to enter the market, and the foreign exchange market became even more difficult to settle. At noon, the rising momentum resumed strongly. Although the after-hours market was firm, it unexpectedly turned into a falling trend after opening, mainly because banks' real selling appetite was still strong. At the same time, due to the decline in public bonds, there was unnecessary concern in the market. In addition, Jewish merchants such as Qiao Zhifu all sold, and the market hardened. Large buyers unloaded their holdings, and the price softened rapidly. However, because banks took advantage of the low prices to purchase and sell, the low-priced trend gradually improved. Unfortunately, banks still sold at high prices. The first telegram from the Indian silver market reported unchanged prices and a shrinking of one anna, leading to a slight decline. The second report from India was flat. After this, people's hearts were settled, buying interest recovered, and the closing was stable. It can be seen that the market situation for the day was characterized by easy rises and difficult falls. However, most of the large buyers were speculative, and any change could lead to a rapid decline. The trend is uncertain, but people's hearts are still showing a positive outlook. The market situation for the day is recorded below:</p>

<h3>Imports Exceed Exports – The Amount Paid Out for Bills Exceeds the Amount Received</h3>
<p>Yesterday was also the end of the month. As in the past, the settlement of bills by banks was naturally busy, but overall, it was inferior to the past. It was only that this time, the difference in the exchange rate settlement and the congestion of various imported goods, coupled with the scarcity of exports, resulted in more payments than receipts. Foreign banks were bound to pay out more than they received. As for the business conditions of the Qianzhuang, in the current period of contraction, there was of course nothing worth recording.

The number of banknotes recovered was over 600,000, and the number of circulating notes issued was over 800,000, with over 400,000 secret mark notes. The source of customer funds was 300,000, with an outflow of 250,000. The Qianzhuang's collection of foreign public bills was over 43 million, and the collection of foreign head bills was over 7.2 million. Remittances from various routes totaled over 500,000. The collection of cash settlements was directly calculated. According to bank collection news, foreign banks collected over 3.1 million in bill payments, collected over 5 million in various goods exchange collateral bills, over 800,000 in telegraphic transfers, over 600,000 in special exchange funds, over 900,000 in foreign exchange settlements, collected over 3.4 million in settlement payments, and 500,000 in warehouse receipts.

<h3>Securities – The Financial Sector Releases the 23rd Barrier</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, the August term had already been settled the day before yesterday, and the October term began with ten sessions. The market opened and all the sessions were opened, and trading was very lively. Initially, people were unanimously bearish because millions from the 23rd barrier, which was closed in the financial sector, were released on the market, and the market price turned down. Rumors arose, which were disproved without any effort. In fact, the large-scale sale of the 23rd barrier easily shocked the already weak market sentiment. Observing that the market price rose in the first session and then completely trended downward, it can be known that speculators were all wary of the large sale of the 23rd barrier, knowing that there was still a considerable amount. They followed the trend, throwing in speculative sales, and the market sentiment became increasingly depressed. The future situation will take the rise and fall of the 23rd barrier as the leader. The trend is still not optimistic. Yesterday's progress was that in the morning, retail investors slightly made up for their short positions, and the market price improved slightly by 0.15 yuan to 0.25 yuan. The previous rows were still stable in the second session, and continued to improve by 0.15 yuan to about 0.3 yuan. After the unification of the salt tax, selling pressure surged, and the numbers 46 and 48 were sold, and the price fell by 0.23 yuan. In the afternoon, all gangs sold, and the numbers 11 and 16, as well as the number 4, were purchased. The 23rd barrier futures plummeted by half a yuan, and the rest also continued to decline. The closing sentiment was still weak, the 23rd barrier fell by another half a yuan, the whole number 6 plummeted by 0.56 yuan, and the number 96 formed an inverted pattern. The market sentiment was particularly depressed. As a result, the 23rd barrier plummeted by 0.9 yuan, the whole number 6 fell by 0.6 yuan, and the rest fell by about 0.34 yuan. The total number of transactions was 11,165,600 yuan. The result of the rise and fall is compared in the table on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit hundred yuan).</p>
<h3>American Speculators Go on Vacation – New York Stock Trading Is Sluggish –</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Bank reported that yesterday (29th) the New York stock market rose, with special stocks being the best. Auto stocks were very strong, and public utilities, railroads, and commercial stocks all rose slightly compared to the previous day. After the sharp drop the day before yesterday, many speculative sellers unloaded their holdings, and people's hearts had improved. However, because most speculators went on vacation, trading was very sluggish. The bond market was mixed, and small exchange stocks rose slightly. The total number of shares traded throughout the day was 900,000.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton – Many Yarn and Cotton Self-Settlements</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the settlement day for the August yarn futures, and the market was closed as usual. The August yarn futures were launched on the market on March 1st at a price of 184.2 yuan. The yarn market was turbulent because of the gold fraud storm, and business turnover suffered unfavorably. Foreign firms seized the opportunity to sell off day by day, and the yarn market fell into a slump. The lowest point of the August futures was 161 yuan, a step down of 23.1 yuan from the launch price. Fortunately, the current yarn sales suddenly became active. Factories were hit by frequent yarn price drops, and closures became more frequent, and reduced working hours became a more common phenomenon, resulting in a sharp reduction in output. Long positions took the opportunity to raise prices, and at the same time, rumors of inflation in the market were extremely strong, which further boosted the activities of long positions. The long-tired yarn market began to react violently, rising from the lowest of 161 yuan on July 2nd to 178.8 yuan on July 39th, a sharp increase of 17.8 yuan in 17 days. Market sentiment was boiling, but the rumors of inflation could not be confirmed. Current sales turned from boom to clear, and the once-excited yarn market fell into a tired path again. At the end of August, large long positions suddenly abandoned delivery and settled all positions. The market disk supported itself, and finally closed at 165.6 yuan, 18.6 yuan lower than the launch price, and 7.4 yuan lower than the July closing price. The remaining amount to be delivered was 1,600 bales, all of which were self-settled. The settlement price for the last three days was calculated at 167 yuan, which was 2 yuan lower than in July.</p>
<p>The cotton market was launched on March 1st at 35.75 yuan for the August cotton futures and quickly broke through the 6 yuan mark. However, due to the influence of financial depletion and the sharp decline in the yarn market, the cotton market gradually fell into a tired state. Factory shutdowns and production cuts became more and more serious, and current cotton sales felt even more sluggish. The falling trend could not be suppressed, and the lowest point of 30.035 yuan was seen on June 18th. However, the bulls, considering that although there was a large inventory of old cotton, most of it was in the hands of banks, and due to the loss, they were all strictly guarded and not released. The market solved the problem of having a large amount of spot cotton available for circulation, and took the opportunity to forcefully squeeze the shorts in the near term. The futures price also rose very quickly due to the flood. At the same time, inflation was reported, and the market sentiment was boiling for a time. The cotton market reacted and rose sharply, with the highest point being 36.9 yuan. Although the yarn market re-entered a tired path in mid-August due to untruthful rumors, the near-term cotton market remained strong due to the efforts of bulls to push it higher. Unfortunately, in the last three days, the U.S. government suddenly announced that this year's U.S. cotton loan was 9 points per 　, 3 points less than last year, and the world cotton market reported a sharp decline. It was not easy for the long position to pull, and they brought a small loss of 0.89 yuan and closed at 36 yuan, 0.15 yuan higher than the launch price, only 0.9 yuan lower than the highest price, and 0.5 yuan higher than in July. The remaining amount to be delivered was 27,100 dan, of which only 1,600 dan were actually delivered, and the rest were self-settled. The settlement price was 35.5 yuan. The number of actual deliveries by the receiving and delivering parties is as follows:</p>
<p>Receiving Party</p>
<p>Xinchengchang Three Zero Zero Yuanxingchang Three, Three Zero Zero</p>
<p>Delivering Party</p>
<p>Changji Eight Zero One Shengyuan One Zero Zero</p>
<p>Yuda Six Zero Zero Tonghe Three Zero Zero</p>

<h3>Guangxi and Yunnan, etc. Continue to Handle Spot Yarn</h3>
<p>In recent days, the spot yarn market has become lively due to the need for purchases from Guangdong, Yunnan, Shanxi, and other merchant groups. Yesterday, although the market closed with the standard grade yarn for delivery, fewer merchant groups arrived. However, Yunnan and other inland areas continued to purchase. In the morning, 374 bales were traded, with prices similar to yesterday. There was no market in the afternoon. The purchasing quantities of each merchant group are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 150 Sichuan 25 Xiamen 2</p>
<p>Yunnan 50 Jiangxi 20 Shantou 10</p>
<p>Inland 53 Haizhou 15 Nanyang 5</p>
<p>Peers 35 Xuzhou 10 Total 374</p>
<h3>American Cotton Farmers Are Still Hesitating</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with slight fluctuations of 1-2 points per month, and trading was sluggish. Whether cotton farmers will sell or accept loans depends on the government's instructions, so they are temporarily waiting and watching. However, some believe that farmers will quickly sell their new cotton at ten cents. Although there is a ten-cent loan, prices may still fall below ten cents. The loan program is very complex, so implementation is prone to delays and confusion. Fellow traders were major buyers in the market, but later, due to increased hedging sales, October cotton was sold in New Orleans, and there was rain in Oklahoma, leading to a decline in market prices and sluggish spot sales. The cotton textile market was firm and active, and reports suggest that a large number of transactions could be concluded. The market closed weakly, with spot prices falling 15 points and futures falling to 15 points. English cotton spot prices rose slightly, while futures fell 4-6 points. Indian cotton was firm due to speculation and hedging purchases, with Pingle rising 2 rupees, Oomra rising 1.75 rupees, and Broach rising 1.5 rupees. Original telegraph from the left (dated 29th).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from the Bombay Trade Bureau, the opening forecast for Broach cotton on the 30th is 192 rupees, down 1.5 rupees from the previous day's close.</p>
<h3>Grain: Bullish Powder Positions Mostly Liquidated This Month</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the powder market opened in the morning and afternoon with a near-month decline and flat far-month trend. The quoted prices for foreign wheat were slightly lower in Chicago by 48 points and smaller in Canada by 23 points. Market sentiment was quite unstable. This month, being the final day, still showed signs of a squeeze on bullish positions due to sluggish actual sales and customers' unwillingness to take delivery. Some manufacturers also had intentions to deliver, so the bulls were panicky, initially quoting only 35.5 cents, dropping to 4.5 cents, and then recovering to slightly above 6 cents after covering short positions. In the afternoon, the market was initially calm, but later, due to the liquidation of bullish positions, it gradually weakened, ultimately closing around 5 cents lower. Far-month trading was not active, and prices fell slightly. As a result, the current month fell 2.25 cents, September fell 1 cent, October fell 0.25 cents, and November to January each fell 0.5 cents.</p>
<h3>Medium and Secondary Wheat Continued to See Price Reductions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market was exceptionally quiet in both the morning and afternoon. Since the current month's auction had already concluded, there was little trading. Although foreign wheat prices for far-month deliveries still tended to be slightly lower, sellers in the market, without actual goods, dared not boldly sell short. The bulls and people in the measuring industry were unanimously waiting and watching, lacking vitality, resulting in an increasingly poor and desolate state. As a result, September was slightly lower by 1 cent, and October was slightly lower by 3 cents. The current spot market also tended to be calm. High-quality goods were still able to hold their ground, while medium and secondary goods were not desired by millers, falling another 1-2 cents. Observing the subsequent trend, it is expected to continue to soften. Shandong opened at 3.65 yuan, Yaowan wheat at 3.63 yuan, Zhangbaling Chuzhou wheat at 3.62 yuan, Gaoyou wheat at 3.56 yuan, and Yufu handled 3,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Du Geng Steady, Foreign Merchants' Indica Rice Sales Still Acceptable</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, over ten sources of rice from various groups arrived (nearly 3,000 shi in total), of which only two or three loads were of Bo Dao (thin rice). Although the market for Bo Dao has seen purchases stop and a fixed situation, each thick Geng rice saw sluggish sales on the local street, leading to a slightly soft trend and prices depreciating by about a dime. Observing the trend, with the softening of both old and new varieties, it seems there is no further reason for prices to decline. Each type of new Geng rice remained balanced in terms of supply and demand, without significant gains or losses. Both old and new Du Jian rice were mediocre. Due to poor sales channels, high-quality new foreign-style sharp rice saw little decline, while medium and secondary grades were reduced by one or two dimes. (Yesterday, only four or five boats arrived in Shanghai North from various routes along the river. The market saw active sales for each type of goods, with slightly active transactions for White Shi rice, and prices for high-quality rice remained stable. Medium and secondary grades slightly tightened. Bo Dao rice arrived in small quantities and sales were balanced, with prices remaining stable. White Yuan rice has stabilized. Although new Ping Jian rice arrived in small quantities, sales were sluggish, and prices declined by two or three dimes. Dong Xin rice arrived in a thousand shi, but sales remained sluggish, and the trend was barely maintained. New Ke Jian rice arrived with balanced sales, and the market trend remained stable.)</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign merchants' Indica rice market had shifted to a stable situation. Shipments from various routes continued to surge, with arrivals from Anhui, Ningbo, and Ningbo, as well as new early rice from machine mills in Jiangbei arriving at the port. The market was originally soft, but fortunately, local street handling was not weak, and there were inquiries from Tianjin merchants about Ningbo early rice from machine mills, allowing the market to stabilize. The selling price of high-quality machine rice even recovered. A total of 1,400 bags of various Indica rice were opened, with over 200 bags going to Tianjin and inland areas, and the rest being handled by local merchants.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market also showed firmness, with local merchants purchasing high-quality rice, while Ningbo merchants and inland areas took medium and secondary grades. The Tianjin merchants suddenly purchased 1,000 bags of broken Siamese rice, improving market sentiment. However, the small Jiao rice was squeezed by the early Indica rice and went unattended, with prices falling by about a dime. Over 4,000 bags of Saigon small Jiao and Luo Ge rice were opened throughout the day, with the majority still being handled by local merchants.</p>
<h3>New Soybeans Fell by Twelve or Three Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the new soybean market was quite weak. Due to the relatively abundant harvest this year, abundant supply, weak sales, and wavering confidence, the downward trend was relatively severe. Shangzhongguan Changzhou Niupi Huang (cowhide yellow) soybeans fell by eight or nine cents to one dime, while lower grades had to be slashed by one dime and two or three cents. Jiujiang soybeans fell less due to stable conditions at the origin, but still fell by five or six cents. The price of three cars of Niupi Huang soybeans ranged from 3.44 to 3.38 yuan, with the price of heavier Wa Kou soybeans only reaching 3.05 yuan. 400 bags of Jiujiang Chengmen soybeans were traded, with prices ranging from 3.50 to 3.40 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Chaoqing Sugar Already Being Loaded and En Route</h3>
<p>According to a telegram from Shantou yesterday, the registration of Chaoqing sugar has been resolved, and the goods are being loaded onto ships, expected to arrive in Shanghai soon. However, it is said that Shantou's inventory is not large, so although the market price may be expected to ease, it is feared that it will not be too cheap. The inventory in Shanghai is also limited. Further openings will be made after goods arrive. The trend in the Public Association's pricing is steady. Spot prices for No. 24 raw white sugar are quoted at 17.20 yuan, with some transactions. New transit cargo is quoted at 5.40 yuan, and old cargo at 5.30 yuan, without transactions. The cooperative company auctioned Huizhou raw white sugar at 16.95 yuan, with 170 bags traded. Medium white sugar was auctioned at 16.50 yuan, with 50 bags traded. 2,000 bags of Dutch raw white sugar at 17.20 yuan did not trade.</p>
<h3>Hardware: English Steel Plates Gradually Becoming Active</h3>
<p>Recently, English steel plates have become more popular because groups in Qingdao, Yantai, and Fujian have added to their stocks. Transactions on the local street are also increasing due to orders from machine factories and shipyards, so the trend is quite active. Although the price has not risen sharply, its stable state is much better than before. For example, 2.5 mm plates are priced at 8.50 yuan, 7.5 mm plates at 6 yuan, 1 mm plates at 5.75 yuan, and thick patterned plates at 5.50 yuan. It is estimated that 600-700 dan have been traded in recent days. It is rumored that the remaining inventory is not large, and the supply is scarce, so the future situation is promising.</p>
<h3>White Lead Sheet Trend Reviving</h3>
<p>The trend for white lead sheet has recently revived, with increased purchasing by customers and active buying and selling by local battery factories. Transactions are good, and prices are up by 25 cents to 50 cents compared to before. For example, No. 2 is sold at 24 yuan, Nos. 3 and 4 at 22.75 yuan, No. 5 at 22.50 yuan, Nos. 6 and 7 at 21.50 yuan, and Nos. 8 and coarser grades are estimated at 21 yuan. It is rumored that 30-40 barrels were traded yesterday.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: New Zhang Yuan Grade Prices Slightly Increased</h3>
<p>The first batch of new Zhangzhou dried longan totaled over 300 boxes, with only one-third being high-quality goods. Most of the high-quality goods were self-managed by the firms. High-quality goods have been fully opened up. Previously, three boxes had arrived unofficially on a previous ship, and the quoted prices were not very accurate. This time, prices increased by one or two yuan, up to several dimes. If more goods arrive in subsequent batches, prices may have to ease. Sun-dried longan meat is more than ten yuan higher than old goods. Arrivals are not strong, so prices are expected to remain stable for now.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Precious Green Tea Sales to Europe Recovered</h3>
<p>For the foreign-owned green tea market, transactions have been sparse in the past two weeks. Yesterday, British firms such as Tongfu, Tianyu, Fushi, Jinlong, and Dude began purchasing precious green tea from Wuyuan, Tunxi, and other regions due to purchase orders from Morocco. Trading in the city became quite lively, and sentiment turned excited. Top-grade hand-rolled goods were opened at 118 yuan, and wholesale goods were opened at 73-74 yuan, down 2-3 yuan compared to before. Needle-shaped, Xiumei, and Gongxi green teas also had some scattered sales. However, there were no transactions in Qimen, Fuliang, and Zhide black teas yesterday.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Woolen Fabrics Mostly Arriving at Shanghai Customs, Awaiting Sale</h3>
<p>The woolen fabric business is gradually becoming more lively, but all transactions are piecemeal. Payments for winter goods still require credit, with good accounts settled by check. Cash transactions are not possible. Large quantities of herringbone, riding breeches, suit fabrics, thick plain fabrics, and various colors of men's and women's overcoat fabrics have been imported recently. However, 60-70% are at the Shanghai Customs warehouses, awaiting buyers before customs declaration, tax payment, and release of goods. This is indeed because the money supply is not loose.</p>

<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Wanlu)</p>
<p>The greatest joy in the world lies in seeking it from the greatest hardship. As the saying goes, "A wife is not as good as a concubine, a concubine is not as good as a maid, a maid is not as good as stealing, and stealing is not as good as being unable to steal." This perfectly illustrates these two sayings.</p>
<p>"Morality is declining," this saying has been passed down for countless years. If it were really declining like this every day, would there still be a world after all these years? I believe that this mentality of "doubting the present based on the past" is the root cause of China's weakness. In fact, the "decline" in "morality" seen from the perspective of conservatives may well be the progress of the world.</p>
<p>All the bad people in the world are forced out by the so-called good people. Without good people, so many bad people would not be created. The more good people there are, the more bad people there will be. I want to use Han Yu's words to say, "If good people do not die, bad people will not stop."</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of National Character</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Our national character is good at imitation and崇尙 hypocrisy, as evidenced by the two matters on the left side.</p>
<p>Rough-cut books are popular due to the prevalence of Western culture. A book publication can sell millions of copies. In some cases, the binding is barely finished before it has to be put on the market without being trimmed, so rough-cut books became popular. It was originally a necessary situation, and not because rough-cut books have any advantages. Unexpectedly, when such books came to our country, people thought that they were fashion and the book was imitated one another. The new books are mostly rough-cut books, but in fact, 60-70 percent of the population are illiterate, and there is more time than needed to be cut in a relaxed time. The situation is different, so why so hastily. When young students buy books back, they use a small knife and cut while reading, which they are not afraid of trouble. Instead, they think that it is not enough to add interest if this is not done.</p>
<p>Western artists with artists' hair. Because they focus on skills, they often left beard long hair without cutting, which is similar to the purpose of the previous celebrities. I did not expect that in recent years, there are some teenagers who deliberately keep long hair like messy grass, thinking that this is the style of an artist. How do these teenagers know anything about art? They live drunk dream and also imitate others and use the artist as an excuse. This is how ridiculous.</p>
<h3>In the Tram</h3>
<p>— Sigao</p>
<p>The tram stopped at Dongxin Bridge.</p>
<p>As it was about to start, a very modern young woman boarded, clutching a small handbag and carrying a small fancy paper umbrella, even though the sun had long set below the horizon.</p>
<p>The tram was not empty to begin with. I and two other passengers were standing. This stop added several more people, making it seem crowded. This young woman stood beside me—no one offered her a seat—and a fragrance wafted over. I have always disliked that kind of scented powder, perfume, and essence, so I glared at her. Little did I know that this was where the incident would unfold.</p>
<p>Thinking that I wasn't paying attention, she took a letter out of her small handbag and deliberately dropped it on the floor, not picking it up for a long time. Two stops later, the tram became less crowded and I sat down. She immediately sat close beside me. After a while, she suddenly seemed to discover something and hurriedly picked up the letter. Turning to me, she looked up with a sweet smile and said, "Sir, you dropped your letter!" All the while acting coquettishly.</p>
<p>I casually took it and saw "Please Open" scrawled on the envelope in pen. Suddenly realizing the potential trouble, I immediately called the conductor over. Smiling, I said, "Someone must have lost this letter here. Take it to the lost and found!" With that, I handed the letter to him. The conductor also smiled, glancing at the envelope, then at her, then at me.</p>
<p>As a result, everyone in the tram started paying attention to her, making her so uncomfortable that she couldn't sit still. At the next stop, she hurried off as if she had lost something. In my heart, I thought, "That was a close call!"</p>
<h3>Foreigner</h3>
<p>— Hualing</p>
<p>A new family has moved into our building this time. Although the people in this family all have yellow skin and black hair, the men wear long gowns and the women wear qipaos, just like us, on the day they moved in, they were given the title of "foreigner."</p>
<p>The reason is that according to Shanghai custom, when a new family moves in, everyone, regardless of age, has to light a pair of candles to heaven and earth when they enter the house. However, this family refused to light them. They said, "Although we are not religious, we don't believe in these things either. If you insist that we light incense and candles, we would rather not rent this house." As a result, the other residents whispered about this family having "foreigner" habits.</p>
<p>On the second night after they moved in, the other residents were playing mahjong until 10:30 PM, and the "foreigner" came out to interfere, saying that it was too noisy to sleep. They didn't greet the other residents much when they came in or out. If a female resident went to their room, they would solemnly ask, "What is your business?" If they couldn't state their business, they would be treated coldly.</p>
<p>The owner of the house had a younger brother who had lost his job and came to borrow money from his older brother. The older brother put on a stern face and refused. He said, "Although we are brothers, you also have the ability to be self-reliant. If I continue to support you, I would only be fostering your dependence. In European and American countries, there are plenty of cases where the father is a millionaire and the son is a blue-collar worker. Although you are unemployed, your unemployment is not my business."</p>
<p>When his younger brother wanted to say something, he simply flicked his sleeves and went upstairs. As a result, the other residents gained an even deeper understanding of this "foreigner."</p>

<h3>Little Western Heaven</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 18: Qi's Party Makes Advances and Fawningly Rejects a Petty Official; Madame's Great Female Power is Agitated, Annoys Her</p>
<p>Commissioner Lan said: "You know what I do? I specialize in investigating and prosecuting you bunch of swindlers. You have the gall to try to cheat me. How dare you spread rumors outside saying that you're a relative of mine? What relationship do I have with you? Tell me!" As he spoke, he slammed his hand heavily on the table. Zhang Jiefu's face turned as white as window paper, and his legs trembled like he was playing the pipa. Commissioner Lan said: "You've been spreading rumors outside, saying you're a relative of mine. What kind of relative are you to me? Say it!" As he spoke, he slammed his hand heavily on the table. The heart that Jiefu had been so happy about that it was about to jump out of his mouth sank right down to the point of being excreted with his bowel movement. He stuttered, "I wouldn't dare say such a thing." Commissioner Lan said: "Would I falsely accuse someone like you? Not only did someone report it to me, but I also sent someone to listen closely when you were bragging to someone surnamed Li just now." Jiefu didn't expect him to have this move, so he could only whisper, "Jiefu was saying he was related to Secretary Qiu, not related to the Commissioner." Commissioner Lan said, "You're related to Secretary Qiu? That's great, we can have him come here to verify it." Then, he turned to the messenger standing at the door and said, "Call Secretary Qiu here." Qiu Zecheng had already been waiting outside the door. Hearing these words, he stepped inside. Seeing Zhang Jiefu standing there, he glared at him first, and then stood aside. Commissioner Lan said, "Zecheng, do you have such a relative?" As he said it, he pointed at Jiefu. Zecheng said, "He's just from the same hometown as me; we're not related." (304)</p>
<h3>Imperial Fragrance Floating Record</h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Deling of Qing, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Ah! It's really amazing! We have always heard people say how smart and clever foreigners are, and now it's really true!" Then she said to me, "Someone once told me that Westerners have a way to make many things return to their original state, I didn't quite believe it before, but this time it's really done! I never thought that something so clear like water could dye our hair as black as ink, and it doesn't stain our scalp, I really don't know what kind of magic it is?"</p>
<p>My father complained that I shouldn't have interfered in other people's business, but I didn't expect that I had managed it so well! The Empress Dowager naturally kept praising me, and specially sent someone to pick out a cheongsam that she wore when she was young to reward me as a kind of reward I deserved. I looked carefully at the cheongsam she rewarded me with, and it was indeed very beautiful, with many orchids embroidered on it; this was because when the old lady first entered the palace, Emperor Xianfeng gave her the title of "Noble Concubine Lan," so there were many orchids embroidered on her clothes when she was young. Later, after she became the Empress Dowager, she naturally stopped wearing this kind of orchid-embroidered clothes, and others were afraid of violating her name when she was young, so no one dared to pile orchids on their clothes; although I kowtowed and accepted the reward in the same way on this day, I still dared not wear it, and had to collect it carefully. Until now, I haven't discarded it. Counting it, the longevity of this cheongsam has been at least eighty years by now, but because of the excellent quality and the careful collection by myself, its color and luster have not diminished, and it is as bright as a new cheongsam.

<h3>Tea Party in the Sky</h3>
<p>— Xi</p>
<p>Nowadays, a kind of tea party is very popular in Shanghai's social circle. Whenever a send-off and welcome some important people to go abroad and return to China, they often hold a grand tea party to show respect. However, this kind of tea party is always held in large hotels or private gardens, which is not as good as the Westerners' holding a tea party in the sky.</p>
<p>In September 1931, twenty men and women in London, England, took a car from the city center to Kroydon Airport. They first toured this famous airport for a week, and then sat on the Royal large plane for a half-hour flight, during which they held an air tea party. Its strong interest is really above any tea party on the ground, creating the newest page in the history of London aviation.</p>
<p>According to one of the twenty people, Mr. Pude, he himself said the situation at that time, which is very valuable to record. He said:</p>
<p>"When we gathered in the hall of Kroydon Airport, everyone's face showed a tense expression, not even a smile. We were all speculating about the experience in the next half an hour. It must be laughable in the eyes of many people who take long-distance flights.</p>
<p>"The first exciting thing for us was to see the big monster lying there, which we will borrow as a living room for tea parties. It is called the 'Coventry City' and is an aircraft with twenty seats, often flying in the sky all over Europe. A small team of mechanics, like ants, climbed on various parts of it, making final checks and adjustments.</p>
<p>"Suddenly, a roar startled us so much that we almost ran out of the airport and back to London. It turned out that the propellers of the three large engines on the plane had started to rotate, emitting a roar-like sound. We were ordered to enter the plane and take our seats.</p>
<p>"We climbed into a small door near the tail of the plane and saw a small room like a subway car, but both sides were single seats, and there was a narrow aisle in the middle. The windows on both sides were open, and we could see everything up and down very comfortably.</p>
<p>"Finally, our plane paralleled a journey on the ground, and then gradually rose. We started flying.</p>
<p>"Most of us twenty people were flying for the first time. Although experts say that the national interest in airplanes is increasing day by day, ordinary people feel that flying is always a very exciting thing.</p>
<p>"The rattling sound of the engine was deafening, so we could no longer talk. We could only see the expressions on each other's faces to know how excited everyone was. The most interesting thing was that ten female guests who usually talked and laughed were all speechless and could not say a word. So, this half hour, we seemed to be holding a dumb tea party.</p>
<p>"We flew to a top speed. During these few minutes, it was almost impossible to see the people in the parks and streets below. On the way back to London, the first thing we saw was the famous Crystal Palace, but because it flew so high, it looked flat, as if it were painted on the ground.</p>
<p>"I was just glancing at the Tower Bridge when I suddenly felt someone tap me on the shoulder. It turned out that the refreshments were ready. A steward in uniform handed me a cup of tea and asked loudly in my ear, 'Sir, do you want one sugar or two sugars? Do you want something else to eat?' I replied loudly, 'Please give me one sugar, oh! Sorry, I don't want to eat anything else.' At this time, we had flown high to more than three thousand feet.</p>
<p>"The biggest stimulus we received this afternoon was that between the turning of the aircraft, we saw a large wing suddenly rising, and everything on the ground flew away like lightning. We stopped to see that the plane had turned a body.</p>
<p>"Although we had been in the sky for half an hour, it was as fast as half a minute. We only heard the sound of the engine gradually decreasing. After a while, we were already over Croydon and began to descend. All the houses, trees and human beings have been restored to their original shape. We grazed over the lawn for a few seconds before stopping in front of the airplane shed.</p>
<p>"When we came down from the aircraft, ten cigarette cases were taken out from the pockets of ten male guests at the same time, and ten small cigarettes were put on ten mouths at the same time. It turned out that we had not been close to it for half an hour. We were interested in everything at this tea party in the sky. The only regret was that there were no cigarettes to smoke, because our hostess, Miss Aircraft, absolutely did not allow people to smoke."</p>

<h3>Water Cancer</h3>
<p>— Physician Yao Erchang</p>
<p>This disease is also a common clinical disease that affects infants. The cause is unknown. It is often caused by intestinal fever or diphtheria, or secondary to a major illness. The onset of the disease is characterized by a localized, dark infiltration on the small tooth mucosa in the oral cavity. It quickly develops into gangrene, causing swelling of the cheeks or rapidly spreading to the entire cheek. It then breaks down and becomes odorous, with enlarged nearby lymph nodes. Other general symptoms include weakness and possibly toxic symptoms (headache, fever, coma, delirium, etc.). If the toxic substances are swallowed, they can cause gangrenous pneumonia or diarrhea. The final cause of death is often sudden collapse. The disease is rarely cured, so the prognosis is poor. Early oral disinfection and maintenance of good physical strength may lead to a cure.</p>
<h3>General Symptoms of Neurasthenia</h3>
<p>— Physician Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>Neurasthenia is a very common ailment. In its initial, mild stages, people are often unaware of it. When it becomes slightly more advanced, people tend to ignore it because it doesn't cause unbearable pain. However, as the root of the illness deepens and the body and mind are affected, a multitude of symptoms arise, spreading like wildfire. Only then do people urgently seek treatment. Naturally, treatment at this stage is more troublesome than in the initial stages. It is regrettable that people do not cherish and protect their healthy and capable bodies, allowing the condition to worsen through procrastination.</p>
<p>Although neurasthenia can be divided into cerebral and sexual types, it is important to understand that the human body's structures are interconnected. The brain is connected to the spine below. Anyone with excessive sexual desire will inevitably have their brain directly affected. In other words, the brain cannot obtain sufficient nourishment, leading to various symptoms of weakness.</p>
<p>Common symptoms of neurasthenia generally include lethargy, easy fatigue, insomnia, forgetfulness, dereliction of duty, palpitations, back pain, and premature aging. The root cause lies in the deficiency of internal secretions. Administering "Germinal Element" replenishes these internal secretions, nourishing all parts of the body, and alleviating the aforementioned symptoms without any other intervention. Therefore, "Germinal Element" is truly the most recent, newest, and most effective remedy specifically targeting neurasthenia.</p>
<h3>Treatment Experience of Kidney Deficiency Leading to Infertility</h3>
<p>— Contribution from Feng Guozhang</p>
<p>Before marriage, I had seminal emission due to masturbation. Since getting married, it has been three years. Not only is there no hope of having children, but my kidney deficiency has weakened me, leaving me without any joy in life. At the same time, various symptoms have appeared, such as dizziness, back pain, trembling hands, weak legs, palpitations, insomnia, mental confusion, fatigue, and so on. The list goes on. Additionally, my memory has inexplicably declined, and my actions are blurred and unrecognizable shortly after they occur. Even slight physical exertion causes profuse sweating. The mental and physical suffering has reached its limit. I have tried injections of tonics, but they were ultimately ineffective. Later, a deceased friend instructed me to purchase and take Standard's Germinal Element from Zhengwei Pharmacy. After finishing one bottle, I felt refreshed. Believing in the efficacy of the medicine, I continued taking half a dozen bottles. Consequently, my mind became clear, my kidney function strengthened, and all my ailments were swept away. Currently, my wife is three months pregnant.</p>
<h3>Alas, Seminal Emission Disease</h3>
<p>— Physician Yu Bofu</p>
<p>Semen is accumulated from red blood and is difficult to store.</p>
<p>Most young people do not cherish it, either harming themselves through masturbation or through excessive sexual desire, leading to the depletion of semen, a gradual decline in physical strength, no hope for health, and an uncertain future for happiness. Alas, is this not pitiable?</p>
<p>The body's limbs and organs are directly nourished by the circulation of blood and indirectly by the nourishment of semen, especially the brain. The brain is connected to the spine below, and excessive leakage of semen will harm the brain. As a result, the brain's nerves weaken first, leading to insomnia, forgetfulness, difficulty concentrating, and aversion to work and fatigue. After a long time, symptoms such as back pain, premature aging, kidney deficiency, and lethargy follow. Thus, the body declines, and various ailments arise. Life becomes devoid of interest.</p>
<p>The method of treatment is to immediately take Himito's "Semen-Consolidating Pills" to eliminate the persistent disease of seminal emission and to take Standard's endocrine preparation "Germinal Element" to restore nerves and replenish organs, thereby achieving both health and happiness. Patients with seminal emission disease should pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>From Female Leukorrhea to Leukorrhea Cure</h3>
<p>— Physician Fei Junfu</p>
<p>Eight or nine out of ten women in our country suffer from leukorrhea. However, due to the prevalence of the condition, people generally do not pay attention to it. It is important to know that this type of illness not only endangers women's health but also harms the strength of the race. Regrettably, most women are confused by the traditional concepts of old etiquette and are unwilling to talk about it with others, let alone seek medical treatment openly. To remedy this misconception and facilitate self-treatment, the introduction of Leukorrhea Cure is necessary.</p>
<p>Leukorrhea Cure is a special external medicine for female leukorrhea. It not only has the function of sterilizing and disinfecting but also can clear purulent secretions and assist the proliferation of beneficial vaginal bacilli. Therefore, it has remarkable effects on cervicitis, metritis, gonorrheal vaginitis, and vulvar moist erosion. All of this is derived from my clinical experience and is sincerely written to fulfill the duty of us doctors to introduce good medicine.</p>
<h3>Another Case of Seminal Emission Treatment</h3>
<p>— Physician Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>Patient Chen Mingqian, male, 26 years old, from Ningbo. At the age of fifteen, he was tempted by his peers and excessively masturbated. By the age of nineteen, he suddenly suffered from severe seminal emission, and his body gradually weakened. His limbs were weak, his memory was poor, his spirit was lethargic, his face was sallow and thin, his head was dizzy, he had frequent dreams, he suffered from insomnia, and his appetite was poor. At that time, he did not receive treatment from a good doctor, nor did he take good medicine. He allowed the condition to worsen through procrastination. Over the past four or five years, the patient's will had declined. He sought treatment from famous doctors, but none were effective. Recently, the disease had become prolonged and the pain had greatly increased, with back pain, heart weakness, tinnitus, and blurred vision. He groaned on his sickbed, and his family was anxious for him. Later, he was introduced by relatives and friends to seek treatment from me. I immediately prescribed Himito's Semen-Consolidating Pills for him to take internally. Within a few days, the seminal emission stopped. At the same time, I used Germinal Element to replenish his weakened body. Within a few weeks, the patient recovered completely. His chronic illness of many years was restored to health in an instant. He was overjoyed and said that Himito's Semen-Consolidating Pills were truly a miraculous medicine for seminal emission.</p>
<h3>Report on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Venereal Diseases</h3>
<p>— Yao Erchang, M.D., University of Pennsylvania, USA</p>
<p>General Back Pain, Mental Confusion, Blurred Vision</p>
<p>Patient Su Xueliang, 26 years old, from Yangzhou. Chief complaint: Kidney deficiency, weakness, back pain, dizziness, blurred vision, occasional seminal emission. Medical history: Due to the weakness of his parents, he had congenital deficiencies. Since entering business, due to heavy workload and excessive labor, he became weak and mentally fatigued. Seven years ago, he was poisoned by obscene books and indulged in masturbation excessively. As a result, he suffered from kidney deficiency and back pain, frequent seminal emission, dizziness, blurred vision, palpitations, and mental confusion. He could not concentrate on his work and could not fulfill his duties. He even feared dismissal and unemployment. Later, he was introduced by a colleague to seek treatment from me. Current symptoms: Insufficient endocrine function, premature aging, kidney deficiency, loose seminal gate. Treatment: Utilizing the latest scientific methods and radio wave surgery, and administering Himito's Semen-Consolidating Pills to strengthen his semen and Germinal Element to replenish his endocrine function. In less than two months, the seminal emission was eradicated, and all symptoms disappeared. He was completely transformed.</p>
<p>Seminal Emission, Kidney Deficiency, and Various Ailments</p>
<p>Patient Wang Shaoshi, 26 years old, from Tianjin, in the banking industry. Chief complaint: Neurasthenia, kidney deficiency, and multiple illnesses. Medical history: He began masturbating at the age of thirteen and only slightly restrained himself at the age of twenty-four. However, this had already caused various symptoms of weakness. Seminal emission was frequent, and he easily became fatigued. At times, he exhibited false excitement. He had taken tonics and received tonic injections, but the results were not significant. Last year, he was introduced by his close relative, Mr. Zheng Weiqing, to seek treatment from me. Current symptoms: Dizziness, fatigue, severe feelings of terror, aged youth gland, insufficient endocrine function, stiff muscles, cold limbs, bowel discomfort, frequent urination with turbid fluid mixed in. His appetite was also significantly reduced. Treatment: Initially, a large dose of Standard's Germinal Element was administered. In less than two weeks, the condition had greatly improved. Next, Himito's Semen-Consolidating Pills were prescribed simultaneously. After two months of continued treatment, all parts had become healthy and performance had returned to normal. He sent a letter of thanks and said that he would be married soon.</p>

<h3>Idle Notes from a Diagnosis</h3>
<p>— Physician Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>(1) Germinal Element Can Be Taken for Multiple Ailments</p>
<p>Patient Hou Deqing, from the business community, 27 years old. He had a weak body and nervous sensitivity since childhood. He felt fatigued all over and his limbs trembled. During the developmental period at the age of seventeen, he did not receive proper care. At the age of twenty-four, he sought employment at a local iron factory, working as a worker administrator. The work was complex and he never rested. After a year of service, his condition worsened as a result. Ultimately, due to issues with living conditions, economics, and time, his resistance gradually weakened, and various ailments took advantage of this weakness to develop. Last winter, he was bedridden due to illness and came to seek treatment. In addition to applying all appropriate therapies, I also instructed him to take Standard's Germinal Element internally. After six weeks, the treatment was fully successful.</p>
<p>(2) A Case of Seminal Emission Cured</p>
<p>Patient Wang Chenghao, 30 years old, from Wu County, Jiangsu. He was born with poor health. At the age of sixteen, he contracted seminal emission. After several years, it never stopped. When it was severe, he sought medical treatment and took medicine, which was only effective temporarily. Occasionally, after exertion, the ailment would flare up. Later, it became more and more severe, almost every night. In addition, his limbs were weak, his appetite was poor, his head and eyes were swollen and painful, his face was sallow, and his back ached. The depth of his suffering was indescribable. In April, he happened to attend a banquet and asked me about treatment for the illness. I immediately introduced him to purchase and take Himito's Semen-Consolidating Pills. After two months, the disease disappeared. Not long after, we met again. He was already full of energy, looking like a different person from before.</p>

<h3>Superheterodyne Beat Frequency Oscillator</h3>
<p>— KMK</p>
<p>Whether it is a superheterodyne receiver or a regenerative receiver, its optimal efficiency and sensitivity occur when the detection vacuum tube is about to oscillate but has not yet become strong. Therefore, wireless technology in certain applications requires a balanced oscillating current generated by a vacuum tube to achieve its full potential and optimal efficiency. Although the oscillator's active component is a single (diode or triode) vacuum tube, achieving balanced oscillations of varying strengths depends entirely on the inductor coils in the plate circuit and grid circuit. Thus, the inductance of the coil is even more important in the oscillator, requiring more meticulous design.</p>
<p>The "Superheterodyne Beat Frequency Oscillator" introduced in this article is one of the easiest types to design for superheterodyne radios. Many Hawk King radios from 1933 to 1934 used this type of oscillator for its ease of manufacturing and stable efficiency, as shown in the attached diagram. The active oscillation point of the oscillator is assumed to be the cathode and plate of the first detection vacuum tube. The oscillator's oscillation coil is series-connected (located externally to avoid affecting its selectivity) to save design and manufacturing trouble. The outer diameter of the paper tube is 1 1/4 inches, wound with 34-gauge American Standard enameled wire: 5 turns between A and B, 42 turns between B and C, and 6 turns between C and D (totaling 53 turns). The coil must be shielded (see the dashed lines around it in the diagram). C is a 0.00036 MFD variable capacitor. C1 and C3 are both 0.00005 MFD (high-quality insulation) fixed capacitors. C2 is a 0.1 MFD fixed capacitor with a voltage rating of 400 volts or higher. R is a 650-ohm fixed resistor. R1 consists of two 50,000-ohm fixed resistors connected in series, capable of passing 2 watts of power or more, otherwise it will easily overheat. After the device is made, if the oscillation current is still too strong or weak, simply replace the capacitance of C3 with a larger or smaller value. There is no need to change the inductance of the coil.</p>
<h3>New Vacuum Tube Similar to All-Metal Vacuum Tube in Properties</h3>
<p>— Pao</p>
<p>Since General Electric announced its "All-Metal Vacuum Tube," American radio manufacturers have paid close attention, even leading to legal disputes. Each related manufacturer is working in the shadows to gain a foothold in this emerging market. Recently, the manufacturer of "Arcturus" vacuum tubes has introduced a novel vacuum tube whose characteristics and base connections are exactly the same as those of all-metal tubes. The only difference is that it still uses the old-style glass bulb.</p>
<p>The naming principle of this type of vacuum tube is the same as that of all-metal tubes, but it is followed by the letter G (the first letter of "Glass") for distinction. For example, "6K7G" indicates a glass bulb vacuum tube with the same characteristics and base connections as the 6K7 all-metal vacuum tube. Its appearance is shown in the attached diagram, with the glass type on the left and the shadow of an all-metal type on the right.</p>
<p>This type of vacuum tube already manufactured and available on the market includes pentagrid frequency converter tubes, general-purpose triodes, triode output tubes, high-mu triodes, pentode output tubes, dual plate tubes, pentode high gain tubes, pentode detection tubes, pentagrid mixer tubes, and full-wave rectifier tubes. The wide variety is sufficient for general use.</p>
<p>Although all-metal vacuum tubes are being manufactured in large quantities, there are still significant technical issues. However, this type of glass bulb has past experience in manufacturing ordinary vacuum tubes to rely on, making manufacturing as easy as riding a familiar road. It is heard that several radio manufacturers have already started manufacturing radios using this type of vacuum tube.</p>
<h3>New 1B5 Direct-Current Dual Plate Triode Vacuum Tube</h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>Recently, Hygrad Sylvania Corporation in the United States released a new direct-current power-saving dual plate triode tube, tube type 1B5.</p>
<p>The 1B5 vacuum tube consists of a triode section and a dual plate section, suitable for use in direct-current superheterodyne radios as a second detector, amplifier, and automatic volume control, etc. The triode section and the dual plate, except for the filament that emits electrons, are absolutely unrelated to each other, so it is like using two vacuum tubes in the circuit without any difficulty.</p>
<p>In practice, the structure of the 1B5 is actually the same as the AC vacuum tubes 55, 75, and 85, only that the filament is powered by direct current, so no cathode equipment is needed.</p>
<p>Its characteristics are as follows:</p>
<p>Filament Voltage 2 volts</p>
<p>Filament Current 0.06 amps</p>
<p>Plate Voltage 135 volts</p>
<p>Plate Current 0.8 milliamperes</p>
<p>Grid Voltage Negative 3 volts</p>
<p>Plate Resistance 35,000 ohms</p>
<p>Transconductance 575 micromhos</p>
<p>Amplification Factor 20</p>
<h3>Amateur Musings</h3>
<p>— Wu Yingjian</p>
<p>When listening to shortwave, it is often easy to miss weak shortwave stations. Because these weak signals do not have the surging sound wave that is emitted in the loudspeaker or earphone in the broadcast band, it is easy to overlook them. Recently, a vacuum tube device has become popular in the United States. It can help shortwave radios find weak shortwave stations and has a special effect when used in heterodyne shortwave radios (not suitable for high-frequency amplified ones). The latest heterodyne shortwave radios in the United States already have this device, called "Beat Oscillator" in English. When this device is connected to a heterodyne shortwave radio, and the switch is turned on, and the radio's dial is turned to a weak shortwave station, the radio immediately emits a hissing sound. If the dial is continued to be turned and passes the station, the hissing sound will immediately stop. Therefore, with this device, weak shortwave stations are very easy to receive and will not be missed. As long as the hissing sound occurs in the radio, then turn off the switch of this machine, and the station's broadcast can be heard in the loudspeaker or earphone. However, one point must be paid attention to, that is, if the radio's intermediate frequency is 456 kilocycles (456KC), then this machine must be calibrated to 466 kilocycles. In other words, it must exceed the original machine by one thousand cycles, otherwise it will not have any effect. Because in this way, a one thousand cycle sound can be obtained, because the original two frequencies (456KC and 456KC) cannot be heard, while a one thousand cycle sound can be heard by the human ear.</p>
<p>The attached diagram is the circuit of this device, using two No. 37 triode tubes. One end is the power inlet line, which can be connected to 110 volt AC or DC. The other end is the intermediate frequency amplifier tube or the grid of the second detector tube of the heterodyne shortwave radio. After this machine is connected to the radio, in addition to the above-mentioned function, it has no other effect on the radio at all. Other components have been noted in the circuit diagram and will not be described separately.</p>
<h3>Remote Control Volume Adjuster</h3>
<p>— Lu Zhimin</p>
<p>A volume adjuster is essential in ordinary radios, and new radios have automatic volume adjusters. But this is not the normal situation, because many radios do not have this equipment, maybe even ordinary volume adjusters on the radio. Even ordinary volume adjusters are very convenient to use. If you are sitting far away from the radio listening quietly, and suddenly encounter a loud, ear-piercing sound, you have to walk to the radio to adjust it, which is very troublesome. But if you have a remote volume control next to your seat, you can comfortably sit in your seat and gently turn the adjuster, and the ear-piercing sound will immediately turn into a soft tone from the loudspeaker. Because remote control volume adjusters have this advantage, here is an introduction to a remote control volume adjuster used on a motorized loudspeaker, as shown in Figure 1, using a potentiometer (40 ohms) connected in parallel with the voice coil and the secondary of the output transformer. You can put the potentiometer in a beautiful small wooden box, and connect the wires with long flower wires for easy movement. The connection method in Figure 1 is more ingenious than using a variable resistor as in Figure 2. It can also make the tone quality more beautiful, but some loudspeakers need to be connected with a 20 ohm potentiometer to get good results.</p>
<h3>All-Wave Radio</h3>
<p>— Pao</p>
<p>A radio that can receive the shortwave band from more than ten meters to two hundred meters, and the broadcast band from two hundred meters to five hundred and fifty meters, is an "all-wave radio".</p>
<p>Because of the increase in shortwave broadcasting stations, there are currently many types of all-wave radios on the market. It can be predicted that future radios will tend to be all-wave due to factual needs.</p>
<p>The reason why all-wave radios have not been manufactured in large quantities for a long time is actually due to a prejudice. The method of changing bands in original all-wave radios can usually be divided into two types: A) Using plug-in coils to change the inductance in the tuning circuit; B) Using a switching arrangement to achieve the same purpose. Method B is simple to install and convenient to use, far surpassing Method A, but some people believe that its effectiveness is not as good as Method A. This is actually a major obstacle to the development of all-wave radios. But in fact, if designed properly, Method B is not inferior to Method A.</p>
<p>Amateur shortwave radios have many devices obtained through experience, or will be universally installed on all-wave radios due to the need for facts. For example: using an extremely detailed scale so that one-tenth of a degree can still be distinguished by sight; using an easy-to-tune "band amplification" device; using a "antenna circuit tuning capacitor" that can exert maximum effectiveness; and illuminating the scale to make reading the numbers quick and accurate. These devices all have the true value of facilitating the reception of shortwave signals, and are worth installing on all-wave radios.</p>
<p>When receiving shortwave signals, the "fading" phenomenon is particularly obvious, the signal is sometimes strong and sometimes weak, even sometimes present and sometimes absent. Therefore, automatic volume control is also an indispensable device for the all-wave radio of the era. Regarding this device, there are many people who are currently engrossed in research. In the future, all-wave radios will have more perfect automatic volume control equipment, so that the volume can always remain unchanged, to overcome this hateful fading phenomenon.</p>
<h3>Outlook</h3>
<p>— Spring</p>
<p>According to a survey by the "Gold Yuan Kingdom" authorities, North America has 19,769,045 radio receivers and 839 radio stations. Recent progress in European radio has also been rapid, with a total of 18,572,380 radio receivers and 276 radio stations in Europe. Worldwide, there are a total of 42,516,904 radio receivers and 1,694 radio stations.</p>
<p>Among European countries, Germany has made the fastest progress in radio broadcasting recently. It is estimated that the number of listeners increased by 300,000 in January of this year alone. This is because Germany is enthusiastically promoting national radios, aiming to make radio universally accessible throughout the country in the short term. Goebbels, the Minister of Propaganda of the National Socialist Party, once said: "Only radio is the only bridge connecting the government and the people, and a powerful tool for educating the people." (The national radio is a very low-cost radio designed by the German government to make radio universally accessible, with each unit costing approximately 76 marks.)</p>
<p>According to a survey by Dr. Starch in the United States, 800,000 automobiles were equipped with radios last year. Over 2,295,770 households in the United States have more than two radios. Listeners with a monthly income of around $200 are the most numerous, followed by farmers.</p>
<p>Canadian authorities have recently banned radio stations from broadcasting advertising programs on Sundays.</p>
<p>In European countries, radio broadcasting is generally controlled by the government, and radio stations rely on listener fees for funding. However, the United States is the opposite. Listeners do not have to pay listener fees, and radio stations rely solely on broadcasting advertisements to generate revenue for expenses. The total advertising revenue in the United States last year was estimated at 73 million US dollars.</p>
<p>The radio station with the greatest power in the world is the Moscow Radio Station in the Soviet Union, with 500 kW. There is also a 500 kW radio station in New Sienna, USA, but it is only for experimental use.</p>

<h3>### The Great Wave of Chinese Thought</h3>
<p>— Murofushi Takanobu</p>
<p>Here I will talk about the "January 10th Declaration." The so-called January 10th Declaration refers to the declaration of January 10th. On January 10th of this year, ten of China's leading professors, including Tao Xisheng and Sa Mengwu, issued a joint declaration. This is the so-called declaration for the construction of a Chinese-centric culture.</p>
<p>Prior to this, in March of last year, the China Cultural Construction Association was established, with branches established in Shanghai, Fujian, Hebei, and Gansu. In October, a magazine called "Cultural Construction" was published. This joint declaration by ten professors was published in this magazine and in Shanghai's leading newspaper, the Shen Bao, and other newspapers, immediately stirring up nationwide excitement. Almost every contemporary Chinese scholar or thinker has discussed this issue, and the Chinese intellectual world is now centered on this issue, showing a new development.</p>
<p>The so-called "January 10th Declaration" by the ten professors is, in some respects, very compromising, skeptical, and seems to be looking left and right, lacking a central grasp. Perhaps this precisely represents the general tragedy of intellectuals who grew up in modern education. In this regard, this declaration, as Cai Yuanpei said, is nothing special, and as Hu Shi said, it is a new disguise for old ideas; however, the waves it has stirred up are enormous. From this, we see the clash of eras.</p>
<p>The January 10th Declaration emphasizes "here and now" and strives to establish a foothold in reality and the direction of this reality. This is very different from simple retrospective thinking and reactionism. Moreover, they also demand something different, such as "not adhering to the old" and "not blindly following." Later, they further said, "Review the past, grasp the present, and create the future."</p>
<p>From this point of view, there are no new suggestions or critical things in their declaration, and no issues have been raised. Indeed, this can be seen as a kind of Darwinian theory of evolution or Hegelian theory of development, but in today's world, there seems to be no need for a declaration.</p>
<p>They then explained themselves, adopting the strengths and discarding the weaknesses, and choosing the good and following it. This is what Confucius called "When walking with two others, I can always find a teacher." As Hu Shi said, in this regard, the declaration has not surpassed Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao by a single step. However, before criticizing the declaration, we must grasp its overall significance, which is its meaning of the era.</p>
<p>The key point of the January 10th Declaration is to emphasize Chinese culture or Chinese-centric culture, which goes without saying. The declaration says, "In the realm of culture, we cannot see China today." China has disappeared into a thick fog, groping in the dark, unable to reach the sky above or the ground below, drifting and wandering in a realm of nothingness. This is the case in politics, economy, society, and thought.</p>
<p>"If China is to raise its head in the realm of culture," the declaration continues, "then politics, society, and thought must all have Chinese characteristics," that is, the construction of a Chinese-centric culture. China is China, so it must create culture based on its own uniqueness.</p>
<p>The problem lies here. The creation of a Chinese-centric national culture is the key point and the point of contention. And the reason why it has stirred up such a huge wave is also in this point.</p>
<p>They talk about reviewing the past, about a critical attitude, and about scientific methods, in order to emphasize "here and now." But this so-called "here and now" refers to China, so the so-called reviewing the past is longing for the heritage of the past, comparing the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods to the Greek and Roman cultures of European history. They want to use this history as a foundation, grasp China's "here and now," and thereby create a culture unique to China. In the waves of world culture, they look back on their past, awaken themselves, reflect on themselves, and after a long record of imitation and translation, continue their own re-evaluation in order to create themselves.</p>
<p>Since Zeng Guofan and Li Hongzhang introduced Western civilization, China, although not as rapidly as Japan, has been moving towards modernization. Especially from the World War to the Northern Expedition around 1927, China moved towards modernization with great momentum. The Chinese intellectual world, of course, could not be outside of this.</p>
<p>During this period, there were two great thinkers, Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao, who, in the great wind of Westernism, warned China not to lose itself and demanded that the people respect the heritage of their own Chinese culture. But they were only John, not Christ. "The sheep did not listen to their voice," and the times buried them in the camp of "reactionary thinkers," and moved forward towards licking the dregs of Western thought.</p>
<p>The eight years of Kuomintang rule in China were a good trial. This trial is still continuing. Whether China can withstand this trial is not the issue, but from this era, a lesson has been learned, which seems to be beyond doubt. At least the era of blindly worshipping the West is now over, which is a definite fact. The Chinese-centric cultural movement represents a new transformation of Chinese thinkers and, at the same time, the lives of the Chinese people. (Translated by Yi Yu from Yomiuri Shimbun, August 23rd)</p>
<h3>### Several Things to Pay Attention to When Reviewing Publications</h3>
<p>— Zhang Sumin</p>
<p>We not only hope for more publications but also for better ones. The quality of publications depends on the method of reviewing them. Therefore, from the publisher's point of view, reviewing publications is an extremely important matter. As far as I know, publishers should pay attention to at least the following when reviewing publications:</p>
<p>1. Pay Attention to the Text — The words to be printed on paper cannot be "careless." Before the vernacular movement became popular in China, the writing in all books and newspapers was quite remarkable. Regardless of the content, the writing was always fluent. Taking magazines as an example, the writing in Liang Qichao's Yong Yan, Guofeng, and Da Zhonghua, and Zhang Xingyan's Jia Yin was good. Even the writing in Liu Shifu's Minsheng Weekly, which promoted anarchism, was excellent. Since the popularization of vernacular Chinese, it seems that everyone can write books and articles. As a result, although the number of books and newspapers has increased, there are very few with good writing. I am not advocating classical Chinese and opposing vernacular Chinese, nor am I promoting literature. I am saying that the writing printed in books and newspapers, whether in classical or vernacular Chinese, must at least be fluent and understandable to the reader. Modern English, although vernacular, is treated very seriously in English and American books and magazines. English and American publishers immediately return manuscripts with even slight flaws in the writing. As a result, contributors have developed the habit of having their writing revised before submitting it if they know it is not very good. The publications with the worst writing in China today are translated books or papers. The reason is that the translators have not deeply understood the language they are translating from and have not thoroughly studied the science discussed in the books or papers they are translating. Publishers only see that the title of the book or paper is fashionable and do not make the effort to review and proofread it word by word, so they print such manuscripts. If readers do not believe this, try randomly picking a translated book or a translated article in a magazine and reading it carefully. You will surely find many confusing places. If you compare it to the original text, you will find many errors. There are indeed good translations, but I dare say that specialized and advanced books translated in China today, such as Marshall's Principles of Economics published by a certain bookstore, are unreadable. This is because Marshall's book is already difficult to read in the original, and translating it into Chinese is not an easy task. To translate such a book, one must have a special study of Marshall, just like the Englishman William Smart translating Austrian scholar Böhm-Bawerk's "Positive Theory of Capital." That bookstore casually accepting such a translation not only lacks common sense but also pays too little attention to the review of the writing in the manuscript. In short, publishers should first pay attention to the conciseness and fluency of the writing when reviewing manuscripts, whether they are original works, compilations, or translations.</p>
<p>2. Pay Attention to Content — After publishers review a manuscript and find the writing to be fluent, they should then examine its content. The so-called content includes many things, such as whether the material is rich and what its sources are, whether the analysis is precise and what its methods are, and whether the conclusion is correct and what its logic is. Other considerations include whether the allocation of chapters and sections is appropriate, whether the facts cited are based on evidence, whether the books referenced are listed, whether the arguments before and after are consistent, and whether the terms and private nouns used are consistent. There are indeed good publications in China in recent years, but most of them have incomplete content. There are also many with terribly bad content. Therefore, I hope that publishers will pay close attention to the content of publications in the future.</p>
<p>3. Pay Attention to Proofreading — The thread-bound books published in China in the past were carefully proofread and had very few errors. The same is true for books in Western countries today, with the principle of no errors being the norm and one or two errors being the exception. However, most of the books published in China recently have many errors, which shows the negligence of proofreading. I believe that the reason for this error is not entirely due to the typesetters, nor entirely due to the proofreaders, but to the sloppiness of the original manuscript. The old books we used to have few errors because we used to emphasize regular script and calligraphy. A manuscript submitted for printing was never sloppy. The reason why there are few errors in Western books is also because the manuscript submitted for printing has been typed very clearly by a typewriter. Try taking a handwritten English manuscript to any foreign printing shop, and they will not print it for you. To avoid too many printing errors, I think publishers can require authors to transcribe the manuscript neatly before submitting it for printing. If there are still errors, the proofreader should be responsible.</p>
<p>I think: A publication with fluent writing, perfect content, and no misprints is a publication that is not a waste of effort from the publisher's point of view, and it is naturally satisfying to the contributor. I wonder what publishers think of these simple words.</p>
<h3>### Collection of Yuan Dynasty Short Lyric Poems</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Published by Kaiming Bookstore, actual price 1.2 yuan</p>
<p>This book, compiled by Mr. Chen Naigan, is very useful for those who study lyric poetry. Ten years ago, the most easily available collection of Yuan Dynasty lyric poetry was only a copy of the Yuan edition of "Chaoye Xinsheng Taiping Yuefu" reprinted by the Commercial Press. Although it was a true Yuan edition, the handwriting was extremely rough and densely arranged, making it unpleasant to read. Moreover, the repetition of names and the mistaken inclusion of tunes easily lead people down the wrong path. For example, the "Taiping Yuefu Surname" at the beginning includes both Liu Shizhong and Liu Buzhai; both Wu Renqing and Wu Kezhai; both Zeng Ruiqing (i.e., Zeng Rui) and Zeng Hefu; both Wang Aishan and Wang Jingfu. Such errors of treating one person as two people do not exist in "Collection of Yuan Dynasty Short Lyric Poems." Liu Shizhong does not have any short lyric poems. Others, such as Wu Renqing, Zeng Rui, and Wang Aishan, are only referred to by their names and have not been divided into two people.</p>
<p>In terms of tunes, Taiping Yuefu also has many errors. For example, Lu Zhi's Jiejiegao is classified as Xianlü in Taiping Yuefu Volume 5, but as Huangzhong in Collection of Yuan Dynasty Short Lyric Poems; Zuitaiping is classified as Nanlü in Taiping Yuefu Volume 5, but as Zheng Gong in Collection of Yuan Dynasty Short Lyric Poems; Guan Hanqing's Baihezi is classified as Shuangdiao in Taiping Yuefu Volume 3, but as Zheng Gong in Collection of Yuan Dynasty Short Lyric Poems; Yibaner is classified as Huangzhong in Taiping Yuefu Volume 5, but as Xianlü in Collection of Yuan Dynasty Short Lyric Poems; Maihuasheng is classified as Shuangdiao in Taiping Yuefu Volume 2, but as Zhonglü in Collection of Yuan Dynasty Short Lyric Poems. Checking Dong Kang's Qu Mu Yun Bian (which is presumably compiled based on books such as Jiugong Dacheng Pu), all agree with Collection of Yuan Dynasty Short Lyric Poems and disagree with Taiping Yuefu. Although the second pattern of Maihuasheng is classified as Shuangdiao, the four untitled poems by Xu Deke, the Haierxiangcha by Qiao Ji, and the poems on the seat, occasional poems, nostalgic poems, Sishi Lexing, and Ke Kuang by Zhang Kejiu collected by Taiping Yuefu and Collection of Yuan Dynasty Short Lyric Poems all use the correct pattern or the first pattern. Li Yuanyu's Bei Ci Guang Zhi Pu Volume 5 Zhonglü Palace also contains the second nostalgic poem by Zhang Kejiu, which further proves that this pattern of 777447 is the correct pattern of Maihuasheng and should belong to Zhonglü, not Shuangdiao.</p>
<p>Ren Ne's San Qu Gailun (San Qu Congkan No. 14) lists 50 tunes exclusively for short lyric poems, 69 tunes for both short lyric poems and suites, and 34 tunes in the style of "taking over" tunes, for a total of 153 tunes. Collection of Yuan Dynasty Short Lyric Poems only contains 99 tunes, but several of them are not included in Ren Ne's book, such as Zheng Gong Tuobushan, Xianlü Nazha Ling, Que Ta Zhi, Qing Ge'er, Siji Hua, Zhonglü Zuichunfeng, Shangdiao Baizi Zhiqiuling, Shuangdiao Yiding Yin, etc. The strangest thing is that Ren's book has "Tuobushan Takes Xiaoliangzhou" but no Tuobushan; it has "Nazha Ling Takes Que Ta Zhi" but no "Nazha Ling" and "Que Ta Zhi"; it has "Houtinghua Takes Qing Ge'er" but no "Qing Ge'er." Ren's book classifies Maihuasheng as Shuangdiao and Jiejiegao as Xianlü, presumably having been fooled by Taiping Yuefu.</p>
<p>Collection of Yuan Dynasty Short Lyric Poems also appropriately classifies Liuyaobian as Xianlü. The original poem is only Qiao Ji's "Self-Description":</p>
<p>I don't compete for the top spot in the imperial examinations, I don't enter the biographies of famous and virtuous men. I am a wine saint at all times, a poetry Chan everywhere. A champion of smoke and clouds, a drunken immortal of the rivers and lakes. Chatting and laughing is the editorial board, lingering, criticizing the wind and cutting the moon for forty years.</p>
<p>The example given in Volume 3 of Bei Ci Guang Zheng Pu Xianlü Palace Liuyaobian is Zhu Tingyu's "Lovely Mid-Autumn":</p>
<p>The bright silver plate surges, the ice wheel moves. Boundless glass. No trace, no sign. Tonight is the best, how can the coming night be the same? Lingering and reluctant, Chang'e accompanies and serves, the heavens, don't let the shadow disappear and turn into the wutong tree.</p>
<p>It is almost exactly the same as Qiao Ji's "Self-Description"; the only difference is that Qiao Ji's first line is ten characters and two lines, while Zhu Tingyu's is seven characters per line. This is just adding embellishments. It can be seen that Qiao Ji's Liuyaobian should indeed be classified as Xianlü. Ren's book classifies Liuyaobian as Zheng Gong, which is another tune, also called Liushaoqing.</p>
<p>Collection of Yuan Dynasty Short Lyric Poems is accompanied by an index of names, with a total of 93 families; arranged by tune, with a total of 99 tunes. This allows us to know how many people wrote short lyric poems in the Yuan Dynasty, how many commonly used tunes there were, and at a glance, we can know the general situation of Yuan Dynasty short lyric poems.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Collection of Yuan Dynasty Short Lyric Poems does not have a catalogue of the books used in the compilation. I hope he can add it in the second edition. At the same time, I also eagerly hope that Mr. Chen can compile a "Collection of Yuan Dynasty Suites" after Collection of Yuan Dynasty Short Lyric Poems to complete this work of "Complete Yuan Dynasty Songs."</p>

<h3>### A Tame Sheep? Or a Porcupine?</h3>
<p>— Chui</p>
<p>Mussolini's recent posture towards Abyssinia has the air of burning his boats, using the strength of a lion to hunt a rabbit, and wiping them out in one fell swoop. Indeed, although Abyssinia has the advantage of terrain and popular support, after all, it is a small country, how can it withstand the latest airplanes and cannons trampling on it? The demise of Abyssinia was long expected by us.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, there is a rumor in Abyssinia recently that "Mussolini will capture a tame sheep, but unexpectedly encounters a porcupine." Tame sheep? Porcupine? This question remains to be considered by us and proven after the event. Although Abyssinia is known as the Black Lion Kingdom, compared to the great powers, it is still a sheep, but this sheep cannot be considered a tame sheep, it can only be considered a merino sheep. Because the King of Abyssinia has repeatedly declared that he would rather be a shattered jade than a complete tile, that is, even with one soldier and one arrow, he would still resist to the end, this sheep can be considered extremely stubborn.</p>
<p>Even in terms of military use, Abyssinia has many high mountains, deep forests, and deserts, so it is quite inconvenient to use troops against it, and it is also very closely related to the interests of Britain. Therefore, even if this war does not expand, given the fierce nature of the Abyssinian people and the incompatibility of the soil and water, and the obstacles of high mountains and deep forests, it will not be easy to wipe them out in one fell swoop. In case the war expands or even triggers a second world war, then the tame sheep and the porcupine are really somewhat unpredictable.</p>
<p>But now the arrogance of the imperialists is extremely high, even bombs are not taken to heart, and a mere porcupine is not worth mentioning. However, if this kind of doctrine spreads, the plunder of colonies will become the highest purpose of the country, completely becoming a world where the strong eat the weak, and what you sow is what you reap, and those who accumulate evil causes will inevitably bear the consequences one day. After the European War, after the pain subsided, they once thought of Eastern civilization, but they gradually forgot over time, and a second world war is about to break out again.</p>
<p>But the great powers are after all the great powers. Not long ago, Mr. Mo made a strong declaration, saying that if anyone prevented the movement to use troops against Abyssinia, I would subdue them by force. However, according to a report from Rome yesterday, Italy expressed that it did not want to sever ties with the League of Nations and would declare that it would respect Britain's rights, and France also opposed sanctions against Italy and expressed satisfaction with the Italian government's intention to present Italy's reasons at the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting on September 4. If this is the case, the great powers have shown signs of compromise, and I think in this situation, Abyssinia should just be a tame sheep, why be a porcupine? It is true that a clever person does not suffer losses in front of him, the words of the ancients are not bad at all.</p>
<h3>### Home Life</h3>
<p>— Cheng Quan</p>
<p>In my youth, holding books in the spray of morning sunlight, in the clear sunlight of the evening, in the winding tones of a contralto singing "Home, Sweet Home," I often dreamed of having a home: so light, so gentle and beautiful, like a small dream on a midsummer night, so quiet, peaceful, and comfortable, like a bird's nest, and finally, so happy, innocent, and bright like the Garden of Eden; where, in my home, a loud and clear laugh would always bloom, like an evergreen tree always green in the garden.</p>
<p>Such a pile of cloud-like, ethereal, and beautiful dreams, following my ever-broken, uncollectible life, has been going on for many, many years (yes, in retrospect, it is an unimaginably long period)! Now, I have lost the happiness of reading Shelley's lyric poems under the moonlight on the third or fifteenth night, and in the exhaustion of running around to obtain some broken and ruined life, I have lost my youth, lost the loud laughter of my youth, lost the fantasias as beautiful and hazy as moonlight; however, I have begun to have a home!</p>
<p>It is a real, truly my own home!</p>
<p>(Friends—those who already have homes—patting my shoulder, half like a malicious threat, half like a well-intentioned warning, and in fact it is a person who has been through it all boasting and teasing a "newcomer," loudly saying, "Good fellow, you finally have a home too. Good, grab it tightly, don't let it give you a headache, frown, or even cry, that's a good fellow! That……"</p>
<p>"Go to hell!" I so exaggeratedly, with confident and proud, very rude and loud words answered them.)</p>
<p>So, I really had a home.</p>
<p>Home, it is really such a home! I carry it heavily day by day: day by day, I also see it more, understand it—understand many, many things, those that are not in the fantastic dreams of my youth, and cannot be found in the song "Home, Sweet Home" that moves the hearts of people all over the world!</p>
<p>For a person who has already crawled over the weight of having a home, this point may not be very unfamiliar: at the beginning and end of the month, I sweat uncomfortably over the rent, firewood, and rice; so, those domestic routines begin to attack you. Like me, my wife is also a person with future ideals and a considerable plan for life; but unfortunately, that ideal is many times higher than mine (one), and this plan is too far from reality. So, living in this low-level life that is so strongly discordant with ideals, she is always (almost determined to be) a gloomy companion; so, when I bring a tired brain home from the office in the evening, that row of books on the bookshelf almost becomes a hateful mockery to me, and now I am not enjoying Shelley's lyric poems, but the endless recitation of my wife's hysterical ideals, which, like a thousand sharp needles, holds my heart tight; I feel uncomfortable, I scold her loudly, I will simply go crazy!</p>
<p>But, that "plan," that "ideal," that negotiation, was the most beautiful poem to me in the beginning (yes, didn't we tirelessly talk for three days about the style of a sideboard?)</p>
<p>As the days passed, we had children! The child interrupted, which was a terrible thing for me! But what made my wife most happy! Without feeling tired, she talked to me all night about the merits and demerits of books like "Infant Care Method" and the merits and demerits of milk powder brands. She said twelve kinds of milk powder names in one breath.</p>
<p>I was angry and tired, turned over, yawned, and closed my eyes.</p>
<p>So a terrible voice rose: "What? I've been talking for so long, aren't you listening?"</p>
<p>"I am listening, dear!" So, I reopened my eyes, abandoned the recollection of being insulted by the manager for a word missing on a document during the day, and began to listen to her narrating the strengths and weaknesses of "Le To Jing"……</p>
<p>So, I finally lived day by day. I will not forget that I still have a broken and ruined life.</p>
<p>However, I have a home……</p>
<h3>Yearning</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>It is autumn, a season for yearning!</p>
<p>In the morning, draped in my morning robe, I push open the south-facing window. The sunlight, like a lazy dog, falls wearily onto the old, paint-faded floor of my bedroom. It seems to be searching for a resting place, having lost the authority it held during the clamorous days of cicadas.</p>
<p>The sky is high, and sluggish clouds drift east and west. The morning breeze greets my face, and I cannot help but shiver. After all, it is autumn, and I am a middle-aged man approaching the twilight of my life!</p>
<p>Across from my bedroom is someone's garden, with a vermilion church blocking my view. The cross on its top glitters with ostentatious lights. Yes, for three years, it has stood before me every day, arrogant and unchanged in its normal state: whether in the peach-blossomed, seductive spring, or the morning glory-draped summer, or in the snow-filled winter, it remains aloof and independent. But I know that the garden's new owner once wanted to tear it down and build a lotus pond, because its old owner's glorious history was erased by a transaction two months ago. Next autumn, thinking that the church might be stripped of its religious authority, I will not be able to live here much longer.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, I inexplicably think of home. That home is in the distant north, now a dusty ancient city buried by yellow sand. I have an elderly grandmother who likes to wear a bright red pomegranate flower beside her silver temples. She told me the reason: the pomegranate flower in full bloom symbolizes a flourishing scene. In the back garden of my house, there are five pomegranate trees, planted by my great-grandfather. His intention was that pomegranates are symbols of many children. Liking pomegranates means hoping for many sons and grandsons, which is largely the same as my grandmother's reason. However, these five pomegranate trees did not understand the good intentions of their master's cultivation. Although they bloomed with red flowers every autumn, the family declined day by day. I have a young uncle who, after I left home, was beaten out of the house by my grandmother with her cane because he lost money gambling and wanted to change the family name of the house with the five pomegranate trees. Speaking of descendants, I should be responsible for my great-grandfather's hopes, but at the age of thirty, I have not yet married a wife. In my old grandmother's letters, she tirelessly tells me about the issue of my family's lineage. Should I find a wife soon? I hope tonight, I can have a lighthearted dream: I return to my ancient hometown with my young wife, and my grandmother, leaning on her cane, points to the blooming pomegranate trees and says in a frighteningly joyful voice, "This year, the pomegranate flowers will bear even more pomegranates!" Yes, an old woman with a full head of white hair wants to see the next generation of children and grandchildren!</p>
<p>Looking at the cross of the church, I hope it is as healthy as my old grandmother; I also hope that its new owner will let it stand there forever as a lovely decoration. It has always been so proudly unchanged in its attitude, and it can withstand the frost, snow, and harsh cold of winter!</p>
<h3>Dusk at the Ancient City Wall</h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>Gradually moving from the bustling streets through the desolate alleys, heading north, we ran all the way to the outskirts, and the sky was slowly darkening. In the open wilderness, an ancient city appeared before us. The city walls had no battlements; from afar, only a tall wall remained. On the dilapidated city head, newly sprouted wild grass covered the surface. A few idlers wandered about, evoking a touch of ancient sentiment in the tranquil dusk. Occasionally, two or three idlers held birdcages, squatting on the city wall, waiting for sunset, waiting to pass the day. Some children flew kites here to while away the evening. All of this subtly mocked the ancient city.</p>
<p>Unconsciously, we ran onto the city wall, hoping to catch a glimpse of ancient Yangzhou from atop. Who knew that the dusk on the city wall would evoke a different kind of emotion. The sun had already set on the desolate outskirts outside the city, and evening dew covered the vast forests. Only the edge of the sky was tinged with egg-yolk colors. An ancient atmosphere perfectly painted the outline of the ancient city, creating a harmonious feeling. From the distant wilderness road came a faint sound of bells, causing wandering eyes to gaze afar. A line of small mules had disappeared into the vast twilight. The gentle breeze carried the fading sound of ding... ding..., as if this was a unique sound of the ancient city.</p>
<p>Looking west, the sun cast its last rays, precisely outlining the high spires of some large temples. This enticement quickened our pace. We descended the city wall, crossed the city bridge, and walked west along the river. There, a group of people were getting into rickshaws in front of a temple. Peeking in the doorway, everyone exclaimed in unison: "This is the Shi Kefa Shrine and Cemetery!" It turned out that the protagonist of the fiery tragedy of the "Ten Days of Yangzhou" was hiding so desolately and quietly in an inconspicuous place outside the city of Yangzhou. Behind the shrine should be Plum Blossom Ridge. Seeing the desolate state of the shrine, it must have been buried in overgrown weeds for quite some time, forgotten by people. But now, people are putting a glorious coat on it again; many workers are moving bricks, tiles, and wood, and people are rediscovering old tastes!</p>
<p>Leaving the shrine, we headed west in search of the large temple. In the dimness, a tall archway appeared before us, inscribed with "Tianning Zen Temple." It turned out that the Tianning Temple in Yangzhou was also unexpectedly discovered. Feeling our way into the temple gate in the twilight, we immediately felt a sense of vastness and seclusion, as if we were thrown into a deep valley, our hearts hovering, unsure where to attach themselves. Beside a silent flight of stairs, the Kangxi Imperial Stele Pavilion was built, slightly making up for an empty corner. Beyond the front hall, there was another empty flight of stairs, leading to the Great Hero Hall? Everything was desolate and quiet. We ran through it without encountering a single monk. Passing through the Great Hero Hall, we ran straight to the back, where a tall Sutra Library stood erect. However, we could not pass through a closed hall door. A sense of emptiness forced us to retreat. On the way back, we realized that the managers of this empty, large temple were not monks but crows. The courtyard was covered in crow droppings, and the trees were filled with black crows and nests. Circling this empty courtyard were not the sounds of Qingqing and Hongyu, but the cawing of crows. The crows reflected the desolation of the temple, yet the crows replaced the liveliness of the temple. I dared not run in the courtyard, but only rubbed the inscriptions on the walls of the long corridor as I darted out of the temple gate. At this moment, a heavy bell suddenly rang at the end of the corridor. The bell rang, but my companions ran out with laughter. Here there is still a bell, it is only regrettable that the bell sound is too lonely.</p>
<h3>A Snack</h3>
<p>— Especially</p>
<p>We, this group of young porters, all share a love for mountains.</p>
<p>It is precisely because of this love that the shapes of mountains and water, as they enter our eyes, are instinctively perceived as uniquely charming, shaking our hearts and bursting with joyful elation.</p>
<p>The mountain path is not lonely. Besides our group, the air does not allow it to remain quiet, perhaps stirring up a layer of solemnity that exceeds its due tranquility.</p>
<p>If you are about to climb over a mountain pass, there are often many bells ringing, and along with the sound of bells, there are the hooves of horses. This immediately gives you a shock, subconsciously making you think of unpleasant things. In this way, the faces from old novels constantly flood your mind, such as "After the sound of hooves, bandits emerged, with the leader holding a steel knife, thick eyebrows, and coarse eyes," or "From afar, one heard a burst of bells, faintly mixed with shouts, rushing straight towards us." These kinds of stories circulate in your mind. Although the aforementioned stories are all elusive, given the current situation, they are liable to occur.</p>
<p>In fact, when the bells and hooves appear, there are no burly men, nor thick eyebrows and coarse eyes. It is just a few donkeys carrying some supplies, stumbling along. Behind them are drivers weathered by wind and rain. Probably because the "responsibility" has been lifted, they wear a light joy on their faces, saying something, a Red Peach brand cigarette hanging from their lips, smoke rising and forming a cloud ring.</p>
<p>The donkey stopped, releasing greenish-yellow excrement, steam rising from it.</p>
<p>——Where to eat breakfast?</p>
<p>——Over there, let's pull the rope, they went over there.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>People are just so hopeless, with particularly strong responsiveness. As soon as they hear someone say "eat breakfast," their own stomach immediately starts to rumble, as if it would be good to eat something right away. Calculating, it has only been two or three hours since breakfast this morning. Why is that? I don't understand.</p>
<p>——Let's have a snack, I suggest.</p>
<p>The head porter did not object, perhaps thinking in his heart, "Why be in such a hurry?" But he didn't dare to say it, burying it in his stomach. From the hesitant expression that was revealed, it could be seen.</p>
<p>——At Yangjia Street ahead!</p>
<p>It's decided. We walked, silent, each with our own thoughts hidden in our hearts.</p>
<p>Yangjia Street is not very big. The straight road is somewhat S-shaped. We unloaded our luggage in front of the thatched-roofed houses, and the long wooden benches were quickly occupied by us.</p>
<p>——Serve a bowl of shuifan (rice in water) and some tofu pudding.</p>
<p>The porters and companions all separated, each concerned with their own food. Lao Huang, Tie, and I were at the same table. Because we ate a lot, the boss's legs never stopped moving.</p>
<p>——Another 300 cash worth of sweet potatoes.</p>
<p>——Sold out, sir. The boss's daughter came over, smiling: Have another bowl of tofu pudding?</p>
<p>The daughter was about twenty years old. Because of insufficient nourishment, the greenish color on her face could not be hidden, but her active energy was always charming.</p>
<p>——Can the one cooking rice fry two eggs? Lao Huang continued.</p>
<p>——Unless it's market day, you can't buy eggs here. She laughed again.</p>
<p>——What else? You go find some? Buy them, and I'll fry them.</p>
<p>She walked out with the money, leaving behind a silent desolation at this table.</p>
<p>——Let's go, it's not early! The head porter called out, urging us.</p>
<p>We donned our luggage, and we were back on our way. Looking at Lao Huang, he wore a bitter face——</p>
<p>——Why hasn't the young lady come back yet? He was probably thinking this.</p>

<p>The art lecture hall founded by artist Mao Zhizhong, broadcasted on Shanghai Radio for the previous two semesters, and was praised by audiences from various ports. The summer vacation was suspended for three months.
