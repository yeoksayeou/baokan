<p>— 立</p>
<p>近數年來。列强以膨脹通貨為恢復緊榮之方法。致釀成日趨激化之國際貨幣戰爭。貨幣戰爭之方式。層出不窮。愈演愈奇。其較普遍而習見者為放棄金本位。减低貨幣成色。收買黃金。白銀。與他國貨幣等等。此種種方法。均足使自國貨幣之對外匯價跌落。而其目的則在使輸入之外貨價格騰貴。銷售不易。以防北其資金之外流。同時使本國之輸出品價格低落。利於推銷。以吸收國外之資金。質言之。卽奪取海外市塲。以期緩和其國內之經濟恐慌。而謀繁榮之恢復也。</p>
<p>貨幣戰爭之目的如此。故就列强與生產落後國家之關係上言。在貨幣戰爭之過程中。則為前者榨取後者之購買力。並摧殘其幼稚之生產率。使其在經濟上成為前者之附庸。我國為生產落後國家。故我民族工業受此國際貨幣戰爭之禍害甚大。就重工業言。我國之重工業尙在幼稚時期。經此打擊。不獨不易發展。且日趨蕭瑟。就輕工業言。我國新興之火柴。捲姻。橡膠等業。則相率减工。甚致有不能維持者。卽佔民族資本大部份之棉舫業與繅絲業。近亦一再减產。停工。極為困難。至於貨幣戰爭中之收買白銀方式。則更使我國之白銀大量外流。致市面上籌碼缺乏。信用收縮。金融業者對民族工業之投資。不得不極度審愼。而其放欵利息之增高。更足使工業品成本增加。不易推廣。足見我國各界直接間接蒙受國際貨幣戰爭之影饗。殊非淺尠。</p>
<p>然民族工業為國民經濟命脈之所繫。而民族工業之盛衰。實卽整個國民經濟之盛衰。國人有鑒於此。乃羣籌救濟。救濟之道。自在國人盡量服用國貨。與金融界之放欵工商。關於提倡國貨自須由政府與人民通力合作。始易見效而。政府所宜注意者則為關稅政策之運用。蓋如能對於國貨中有可代替之外國商品。增其稅率。則國貨廠商。自必受益不淺。對於輸出方面。苟予積極之獎勵。如資助輸出商與航運業。减低或免除出口稅。並指導工商改良生產技術。則我國國際貿易。或亦不難推廣。至於人民。則消費者之應為生產者之後盾。以利國貨在國內市塲之推銷。亦屬重要。自不待言。關於放欵工商。自屬金融界應盡之責任。今財政部已明令金融界放欵救濟工商業。並確定放欵之對象為製造國貨之工廠。販賣國貨之商店。及運輸國貨出口者。是政府對於獎勵輸出及貸欵工商。已在進行。是以此後國人誠能盡量服用國貨。政府如再運用關稅政策。限制輸入。則我國所蒙國際貨幣戰爭之惡劣影響。當可逐漸减少矣。</p>

<p>（巴黎）蘇俄外委李維諾夫原凝由日內瓦來巴黎、茲忽作罷、遄返莫斯科、致法俄互助協約發生頓挫、此問各報以為此項頓挫似非恒久性、衆意法俄兩國所以遲遲未印妥協者、乃因法國欲將該協約在國聯機構內成立、且不妨礙法國在洛迦諾公約下之義務、但蘇俄政府則欲互助恊約為自動的之故、現信雙方意見之參差必能設法消釋、法外長賴伐爾赴莫斯科時必可簽定該約（二十日路透社電）</p>

<p>市社會局昨發表告全市農民書云、農民們、這幾年來、中國的農村、好像是交到了一種厄運、不是天災、便是人禍、連綿不斷的、把農友們漸漸地變得窮苦、漸漸地衰頹了、數年前、對於生活上的種種需要、覺得還能勉强過去、並不愁苦憂急、但如今就不同、常是愁着「衣沒得穿」·「食沒得飽」·「居不能安」·的問題了、在表面上、這是誰都會感覺的一個通病、然而根本的癥結、還是在於農業本身的落伍、沒有一種新的智識來防除災害和增進生產的技能、因爲生產的日漸衰落、便影響到農村經濟的破產、加之國際資本主義的重重剝削、益吏農友的生活、陷於困苦的境地、這是實在是一件嚴重而可怕的事情、不單使偌大的農村崩潰衰落、甚且使整個的中華民族不能振興强盛、但是若要復興農村、解除農友痛苦、改進農友生活、並不是一個困難問題、因爲二十世紀是科學的世紀、任何事業、都得趨向到合理的科學化、新的農業、現在已有驚人的進步、他們是用集團的組織、科學的方法、選擇種子·驅除病蟲·收穫農產·灌施肥料·改進耕耘、甚至利用了飛機來散播種子·施散除蟲藥粉、使農作的產量、日漸增加、農友的生活、日漸改進、成爲今日世界上富强的國家、我們要使我們的農業有進步、農友的生活有改進、自然不得不運用科學的方法、因爲人的體力、是敵不過機械的、而欲運用科學的方法、就不得不推求新農業的種種智識來求生產物的品質改進和生產額的數量增加、這樣便可打破農友們現在困苦的一種局面、進展到安居樂業田園繁榮的一個境域、人民土地和主權、是構成我們國家的主要原素、在中國人數佔有最多的、就是農友、如果每一個份子、能使自己的農業有進步、每一個份子、能使自己的生活得安樂、換句話說、也就是每一個份子、能够「自治治人」、「自養養人」、「自衛衛國」、那末就是增强着國家的一種富盛之力啊、一年之計在於春、春是農作開始耕耘的一個序幕、所以如今我們要舉行一個「春耕運動」、就是根據着這一種重要的意義、而來從事的、在舉行「春耕運動」的期間、我們是用着巡廻演講的方式、深入到本市各個農村、來將各種農友切身的問題如種子的選擇蟲害的驅除、農作的栽培、農具的改良、畜牧的飼餐、副業的提倡、水利的疏濬、合作的提倡、等等、估一個詳細的介紹、使農友們能得到新農業智識的增加、和生產技術的改進、所以我們要請親愛的農友們、踴躍地來參加這個運動、希望農友們大家努力吧、起來建設一個新農業的國家、</p>

<p>香港訊、每年一度之特別銀牌足球比賽、自一八九七年創辦以來、經有三十五屆、總計成績、濬海陸軍足球隊爲最佳、南華亦嘗得三度冠軍、本年第三十六屆、經數週輪之大戰、而結果得决賽權者、爲南華華與西警兩隊、巳於十三日星期六下午四時一刻在香港會球塲舉行最後决賽、是日南華華以西警強於守、為增厚進攻力及守衛起見、請球王李惠堂及攝鐵手包家平出任巨艱、二人以大義難辭、舍身成仁、於是南華華之實力一振、而爲球迷所注意、一時撥冗前住參觀者、絡繹於途、瞬息而偌大之香港會球塲、巳吿擁擠滿座、其一種熱鬧情形、爲近來所稀見也、比賽結果、果然天魁星命帶金剛、聖水將軍突然一脚而造成南華華之佳名、以二比一奪得本屆錦標、於是榜上有名、永留千古矣、</p>
<p>包家平　其功最偉</p>
<p>在未述戰情之先、記者試評雙方之表演、是日南華華之勝、實從辛苦中得來、而厥功最偉者則爲包家平、其所挽救之危球、有能爲人之所不能爲者、其博得掌聲固然、而吾謂南華華之不負、包之力也、其次爲李淦林德譜、楊本漢亦出色、球王李惠堂此次復現色相，因久疏於練習故、不及往昔之活潑、然其雄固依然也、至於西警一隊、前鋒平庸、失機者再、忌連尤甚、地派路與摩士雖仍活動、惟因中路軍射門欠準、亦未見出色、而在守一方面、柏健士之力救險球、帕架·施派路之力解危局、歌扶·布碌士之助守助攻、實佳於南華、而南華之所以得以頻頻侵入西警防地者、因是日西警震於李惠堂之威名、除用歌扶守之外、並令布碌士助之、帕架依然力守楊水益、故其左方及中路甚固、然因此而掀動右方、只由布力般上前守李石友、布爲後衛、不敢過前、而亦不敢過後、此所以李石友之活動較楊水益爲多也、而南華遂亦得乘間而進攻、西警察於是不能不陷於危境矣、其所負之兩球、均屬無可挽救者、故南華之勝、亦非倖致、表演情形錄下、</p>
<p>上半場　未分勝負</p>
<p>雙方佈陣旣巳、南華華卽撥球進攻、未及中線、巳被截去西警乘勢反玫、爲勢殊猛、進至南華門前、惟無法命射、李淦偷得球兒送前、李惠堂進至西警後防、因慢失機、李石友又復進侵、得機傳中、球過門前、黎兆榮衡前不及、又失一機、帕架於解圍後助前鋒進攻、布碌士施遠射、包家平一手攝去、始獲解圍、李惠堂得接反攻、黎兆榮助之而進、迫得角球、楊水益踢來殊佳、李惠堂接應命射、惜未中的、此時雙方接戰二十餘分、仍未見開紀錄也、後西警一鳴驚人、地派路從邊突進、急行命射、包家平雖接得、亦負角球、地派路踢來頗妙、史梯芬士一踢高去、西警一攻不入、反爲李石友所乘、長驅直進、挑過布力般傳中、柏健士撲出施救、球再滾至李石友脚下、李一脚射去、辛施派路機警、立於門中、見球來跪　救之出險、得以不負、兄弟聯同一氣、地派路</p>
<p>反攻、又得角球、但未能因便取利、然南華</p>
<p>圍一陣、幸得楊本漢回師救駕、突出重圍、轉送與李石友進襲、得角球、但爲柏氏所救、南華遂退、西警贊士頓領隊反侵、南華被優勢危、帕架冷箭一放、包家平急乎拍出、始吿無事、忌囂繼之活動、轉由贊士頓一頭撞去、越出界外、南華因又晚險、一波未平一波又起、西警三鋒如湧而至、包家平雖接得、但因勢危、寗負角球、西警雖得此便、亦無所得、此後雙方一來一往、各有危險、然結果仍未有開紀錄也、上半塲零比零打成平乎、</p>
<p>二對一　奪得錦標</p>
<p>休息十分鐘、雙方疲兵再戰、西警一鼓作氣、但進至中防、即爲余慶元·楊本漢拒退、西警有如潮湧、旋退旋進、南華不虞有此、被其擊破防綫、由布碌士送前、摩士得機命射、包家平跪地截之、球反彈高、包急抱之踢出、雖然脫險、然亦一額汗矣、南華旣幸免、卽將球送前、李惠堂乘虛而人、布碌士力糾之、李不能射、遂失機、戰約十三分鐘、而南華始得勝利之神之所護、楊水益得球直進、相機傳中、布碌土截之、球反滾之楊前、楊遂一脚射之入網、先閒紀錄焉、南華旣勝、更得觀者之鼓勵、爲勢益熾、但西警因負益努力、而情乃吏劇、贊士頓·忌囂先後命射、均爲包氏救出、送與楊本漢、楊轉與李石友進取、李一挑一撥、弄過西警中防傳中、李惠堂接應將球挑入網內、時距勝第一球不過四分而巳、南華旣以二比零佔先、仍不稍懈、西警見勢巳去、爲作破釜沉舟之計、施派路轉充左翼、圖增進取力、果然拚命之下、盡佔上風、先後將南華包圍幾次、贊士頓·史梯芬士命射、均爲包家平救去、南華亦嘗反攻數次、但無所得、西警再續進侵、於將完之最後一分鐘、由忌連乘地派路傳中之便、用頭頂回一球、成二比一之局而終、雙方陣綫如下、</p>

<p>香港訊、督憲杯足球决賽巳於十四日星期日舉行矣、過去兩屆、錦標均屬西聯、故是日未賽之前、球迷莫不充滿希望、以翼在此屆能雪一口氣、然希望自是希望、本屆華聯隊又不幸以一比二而負、將第三屆錦標、仍拱手讓於西聯、致令觀者無不爲之唏嘆、以情熱觀之、夫華聯之負也、技術本不讓于人、惜以球運不齊、上半塲失機者屢、以致戰成和局、迨下半塲、華聯以氣力不如人、守多攻少、更以罰球頻頻、險象現生、第一球之負、西聯之勝、未嘗不因罰球之賜也、幸而華聯仍不以負一球而自餒、卒造成一比一和局、然不獨此也、此時華聯隊以反敗爲和、軍威大振、節節進攻、在一般球迷觀之、以爲華聯其必操勝算者突、及至在西聯腹地混戰中、西聯以犯規被罰十二碼自由球、四座球迷、莫不欣喜、意謂此大好時機、華聯必於一剎那間、反和爲勝、距知譚江柏負傷出塲主踢、彈中門將之身而不入焉、舉座球迷莫不惋惜而嘆功敗垂成也、截至比賽額定完塲時間、結果打個平乎、加時易地再决戰、烈厘本早巳越界、照理應判罰任意球、惟證人似無所睹、結果藉此機會而獲勝焉、是日兩隊出塲人員如下、</p>

<p>西聯足球最後了了人事之二戰、（一）爲昨日之東華對臘克斯（一）爲今日之東華對英尼斯、東華因全軍赴韓、昨日乃以乙組人馬瞧戰、且留滬之戴麟經陳虞添等、俱未出塲、故實力大减、致結果被臘克斯以四比二取勝、上半時尙屬勢均力敵、成一比一、下半時臘克斯之勢轉盛、因是東華慘敗、今日下午東華戰英尼斯、仍在申園、</p>
<p>屢攻不入反受挫</p>
<p>戰幕揭開後、臘克斯開球前進、半途被拒、東華健兒、乃奮勇而攻、左右兩翼、驍勇過人數度運球深入、造成絕佳之攻門機會、惜中路三人、缺乏射鬥脚頭、致機會頻頻錯去、相持約二十分鐘後、東華攻勢漸衰、臘克斯乘機反攻、拉里忽從右路來襲、在二十碼處射入一球、</p>
<p>上半時秋色平分</p>
<p>東華一球旣失、乃傾全力反攻、越五分鐘、薛文繡得龔以斌之策應、射入空鬥、造成和局、入後、東華攻勢益盛、錢佐芝得球挺進、輾轉人腹地、在七碼處遙射一記、羣料必中、不意一脚踢去、越橫木而逸、良機錯過、四座同聲嘆惜、一次臘克斯拉里一脚遠傳、哈脫倍根與錢佐芝同時躍起猛頂、着地時哈脫倍根突然左脚抽筋、臥地不起、不得已乃啊時退出、混亂良久、上半時即以一對一之比告終、</p>
<p>下半時連失三球</p>
<p>下半時起、哈脫倍根抽筋未愈、不能出塲助戰、臘克仍以十人迎戰、約十分鐘時、阿提格在十二碼內疾踢未中、失之桑榆、收之東隅、阿提格盤球前進、守門關澢安跑出欲阻、但阿提格巳先一脚、撥入空門矣、造成二對一之比、移時阿提格輕駕熟道、又中一球、嗣後拉里帶球推進、張　阻之不得、關檔安束乎受擒、球由左下角而入、咸四對一之比</p>
<p>四比二臘克斯勝</p>
<p>東華囂失三球、全軍異常憤懣、乃抱破釜之志、努力再攻、薛文　得球、遙傳中央、踐佐芝接得來球、迨至時期成熟、即猛力一射、準而有力守門猝不及防、正擬一妓而下、奪得最後勝利、奈時不我與、長笛一鳴、時間吿終、四與二之比、臘克斯偉勝、</p>

<h3 id="c190">讀書運動第十一日　何炳松講研究史地 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>昨爲中國文化建設協會主辦之全國讀書運動大會第十一日、特請史地專家何炳松演講怎樣研究史地、全文紀錄如次、今天承中國文化建設協會的盛意、叫我對諸位講一點怎樣研究歷史和地理、這兩種科學、我現在把我一得之見、提出和諸位談談、並請求指敎、</p>
<p>史地的性質</p>
<p>我們現在先講歷史和地理兩種科學的性質、歷史是研究人類過去生活和活動的科學、地理是研究人類現在的生活和活動的科學、這兩種科學的對象是大體相同、不過研究歷史以時間爲經、就是我們要研究從最古一直到現在爲止的人類生活和活動的經過悄形、不過人類的生活和活動、次不能離開地球的、所以亦不能不以研究空間的地理爲緯、至於地理的研究是以地球的表面爲經、所以地球的表面、包括下面的地層和上面的大氣、我們要研究的是人類怎樣征服而且利用這個地球的表面來增進自己的生活、和促進文化上的活動、但是人類征服而且利用地球表面、决不是一天所能辦到、所以我們又不能不以歷史爲緯、照這樣看來、歷史和地理、雖然一種是研究時間中的人類、一種是研究空間中的人類、但是因爲他們所研究的都是人類生活和活動、所以有互相爲用的功効、不可偏廢、</p>
<p>史地研究的對象</p>
<p>所謂人類的生活和活動、普通可分爲五種、就是政洽的·經濟的·宗敎的·敎育的·和藝術的、這五種生活和活動形成了所謂人類的文化、我們研究人類的或各國的歷史、就以他們的文化爲我們的對象、亦就是以這五種生活和活動爲我們的對象、地理亦是如此、不過因爲地理所研究的除上述五種生活和活動外、還要特別注重人類征服　　　　球的表面的問題、因此我們研究地理時、就還得同時去研究全地球的或各國的面積·天產·氣候·和水陸交通等等問題、看他們怎樣影響到人類的生活和活動、這是普通所謂人生地理、近來有人說、一部人類文化史、就是人類征服並利用自然的歷史、所謂自然就是地理學的對象、那我們亦可以說、歷史就是過去的人文地理、地理亦就是現代的文化史了、簡單的說、歷史學的對象是人類過去的文化、地理學的對象是人類現代在地球表面上繼續創造的文化、</p>
<p>目的和價值</p>
<p>我們研究歷史和地理、目的和別的科學一樣、都在於求眞、所謂眞、在歷史上就是過去人類在文化上種種生活和活動的眞相、在地理上就是現在人類在文化上種種生活和活動的眞相、我們要明白人類過夫文化的眞相、來帮助我們决定爲文化而奮鬥的途徑、可以使我們不至於再走到錯路上去、我們要明白人類現在文化的眞相、來做我們創造新文化的參考、香到知己知皮的功用、我以爲這或者就是歷史地理兩種科學的目的和價値、亦就是我們應該研究這兩種科學的理由、</p>
<p>救真的重要</p>
<p>歷史和地理的目的、何以都要求眞、這是因爲眞原是人類最高的一個理想、凡是故意作僞的、或是祗見到一部分的結論、部是不合科學精神的結　、我們都應該排斥、研究歷史和地理、尤其是不宜有主觀的見解、或者顚倒是非、或者淆亂黑白、成者以偏概全、以這種見解去研究歷史和地理、等於帶了一副有色的眼鏡、去觀察眼前的一切東西、我們所見的顏色祇配我們自己去賞識、所得的結論亦祇是一種有色彩的結論、把他拿來宣傳個人的主張、是可以的、但若是當做一種科學上的貢獻、就大有問題、這個態度問題非常重要、我們研究史地的人須得要隨時提心吊膽的防備他、</p>
<p>研究史地的方法</p>
<p>研究史地旣以求得眞相爲目的、那就祇有採用現代所謂科學的方法、科學方法的特點、第一我們的態度要能够絕對的客觀、我們研究史地時、要絕對排除自己的成見、無論是非黑白都還他一個本來的面目、「知之爲知之、不知爲不知」、要絕對的不要增减一分、或者祇見得一編、或者祇見到大部、要絕對的不要自命爲巳見到全體、那末歷史的人物和事體、現代世界上各地的人民和風俗、方能抬起頭來、露出他們的眞面、否則他們就都要隱藏在我們成見的濃霧中了、這是科學方法上第一個特點、就是客觀的態度、第二就是我們應該適用觀察方法、這個方法用在地理研究上是毫無問題的、因爲我們現在巳有許多科學上機械和儀器、來帮助我們工作了、例如測騐大氣和山的高度、我們可以利用汽球·飛機、或飛艇、測騐海洋和地屬的深度和廣度、我們可以利用輪船和炸藥、測量地面的形象、我們可以利用飛機、現在地球上自然的狀態、除兩極地方因氣候寒凍　係、還待我們努力外、差不多都有觀察明白的　望了、至於現代人類文化的部分亦有各國政府的統計、可資參考、亦大體都有辦法的了、</p>
<p>歷史研究法</p>
<p>唯有歷史因爲過去的都過去的了、當然沒有法子可以觀察、古代遺物留到現在的、又並不很多、而且又不能當作全部的參考、所以我們現在大體祇好靠着古人的紀載來做我們的根據、因此歷史這一種科學、還不能算是一種純粹的科學、不過現代另有一種專究歷史的方法、這就是我國人所說的史料考訂法、所謂史料、雖然包括遺物和文字的記載爲大宗、考訂史料的原則、最重要的有兩個、第一、就最史料要求其應有盡有、所謂該備無遺、第二、就是要在極博的史料中得到的真相、或是不用客觀態度求的真相、都不是歷史學上合於科學的真相、我們絕對不能信賴他、因此我們一面要求得極博的史料、一面要用極客觀的態度去考訂他們、以求得真相為止、考訂史料的工作、又可分為兩步、第一步、是考訂史料的作者是否是一個誠實無欺、一筆謹慎、而又毫無成見的人、這就是所謂「論世知人」的工夫、第二步、是考訂這一種史料是否是一種原本還是後人假造的東西、這就是所謂「考訂眞僞」的工夫、每一種史料都要經過這一番工夫、史料的作者和史料的本身都可靠了、我們才可信用他、根據他所紀載的情形、當做某一個古人或某一件大事的眞相、這種考訂工夫爲研究歷史的最重要的一步、我們因爲時間關係、不能多講、諸位果有興趣、請看拙著歷史研究法一書、可以得其大概、並于我們怎樣應用歸納的方法、把史料所紀的事實、綜合起來、求得眞相、怎樣應用演繹的方法、把一部份史料所紀的事實、推測他眞相的大概、我想這是凡是懂得思維術的人和考訂工作的人都已知道、不必我再去細講了、第三在科學方法上、還有所謂實騐、在歷史上是不能應用的、因爲過去的人和事、都不能復活復現、讓我們再三去實騐、在地理上亦祗好適用覆核的方法來證實別人的觀察、不過比歷史要方便要正確多了、</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>總之我們要明了過去的和現在的人類的文化、我們應該研究一點、歷史和地理、我們研究史地應該抱客觀的態度、盡量利用科學的方法、以求得人類在文化上各種生活和活動的眞相、我們切不可顚倒是非、亦不可將僞作眞、秉筆直書、直言無隱、這或者就是史地研究所給予我們的敎訓、完了、</p>

<p>— 君朋</p>
<p>小朋友們！我們要知道，現在的世界是科學的世界，科學世界裏頭要有一個「科學的中國，」科學的中國要誰去創造呢？要我們現代的兒童！但是，怎樣去做一個「科學的孩子」呢？</p>
<p>手腦聯盟　科學是從把戲中玩出來的，這科學把戲，不是可以瞎玩的，你如果只會玩而不會想，那末，你只配呌把戲大王手下的小嘍囉，不是一個「科學的孩子。」你不要忘記這兩個現成的賓貝，就是「雙手與大腦。」你必須請大腦做總司令，請雙手做十個小兵，大家聯盟起來，向着宇宙間的一切神秘進攻。</p>
<p>兩個偵探　你要向大自然進攻，不可以沒有偵探。小朋友！你猜猜看是誰？就是一個呌眼睛，一個呌耳朶，你的眼睛原是明亮的，爲甚麼戴上了染色的眼鏡？把染色眼鏡拆下，它便成你的千里眼。你的耳朶原是聽得淸楚的，爲甚麽要戴上了迷信的耳朶套？把它拆去便成你的順風耳。有了千里眼順風耳做偵探，你的總司令和兩員大將，十個小兵士，便能知已知彼，百戰百勝。</p>
<p>活的兵書　打仗須要兵書，否則有勇無謀。但是它用的是活書，風雨雲雪，日月星辰，以及宇宙間一切的變幻，這都是活書，天空打雷，你就要追問：「那是什麼道理」？日蝕和月蝕，你的兩個值探切不可以上它的當，他說：「月蝕是一個野月亮吃一個家月亮。」你相信嗎？呀！要求眞實的智識，必先要打開諸如此類自然界上一切神秘之謎，要在這偉大的戰塲上，來用這活書才行。</p>

<p>— 孫育才　徐征吉</p>
<p>（一）畫荻敎子</p>
<p>宋朝時候有一個文人呌做歐陽修的，他生出了才四歲，他的父親便死了。當時，家境非常窮困，他的母親鄭氏，因買不起紙筆，當用荻（蘆葦類的植物），畫地敎他識字，敎他讀書。</p>
<p>歐陽修經過了他的母敎，智識大開，學問上也就慢慢的有了相當的成就。</p>
<p>後來又經過一位良師的指導，果然舉進士甲科，做過諫官。的確在宋朝很有些功績，晚號六一居士，着作很多，有新唐時和新五代史，都很著名。</p>
<p>宗慤少時的大志</p>
<p>宗慇很小的時候，便能彀讀書用功。一天，他的叔父呌做少文的，喚他到面前，問道，「你將來的志向怎樣？」宗慤說道：「我將來的志向，要乘長風，破萬里浪！」叔父聽了，很贊賞它。後來宗慤果然爲當代名將，奉令克服林邑，封洮陽侯。</p>

<p>— 達齋</p>
<p>我自幼就喜歡花，更喜歡自己種花，雖然是分點工夫去培植，可是當初不明白灌溉的方法，以爲愛花要動加灌溉的，每天澆的次數愈多，也就愈好；那知適得其反，無益有損，所澆着那過份的花，轉見衰弱，以後纔知道澆花須有定時與標準的。</p>
<p>花以吸收水分爲養料，至於人的養料就是進食，人對於進食，也同澆花一樣，旣要有定時，又要有標準；假若不在一定吃飯時間，閒食吃得過量，無形之中，要損傷脾胃，貽害營養，妨碍健康，正合俗語說的「吃得不受用」了。我看到有些小朋友，——尤其是家庭經濟寬裕的，在午飯前，閒食吃得多，臨到吃午飯時，雖佳餚羅列，在他看來，好似都不合口味，吃不了幾口飯，就放下碗筷了，那不明白綠故又愛子心切的媽媽，總是說：這孩子很奇怪！怎麽有這些樣好菜，他還是吃不下飯呢！」實則飯前閒食過飽，飽則厭餐，何嘗是菜味不佳，又何嘗是飯量太小呢？古人說：「努力加餐飯」，旣不能努力餐飯，營養當然不足，所以肌肉消瘦，甚或面色蒼黃，這種壞習慣，影響體質很大，項知鍛鍊體質，非常重要，也像好花得養，自會繁榮啊！</p>

<p>— 醒霞</p>
<p>凡是活潑的小朋友，一到了春天，沒有一個不愛玩紙鳶的。因爲它是時令的表現。因爲它有美麗的色彩，和翱翔的姿勢。因爲它些能引起自然的運動。同時，也可換換新鮮的空氣。這種很有優良性的娛樂，對於兒童，眞有很大的益處。據說，除上面的幾種益處而外，它還能使兒童們排洩內熱。就是「續博物志」上說過。」今之紙鳶，引絲而上，令小兒張口望禮，以洩內熱」。這話倒也是很對的。本來，患眼病的人種不良病象，（如害眼，嗆咳，發熱……等等）。庶幾不致呌做父母多所擔心呵</p>

<p>— 文譽揚</p>
<p>小朋友！我來敎你們做一隻貓頭鷹來玩玩，這是很有趣的玩具。先準備好下面的材料（如圖），一鐵釘，二竹枝，三剪圓的紙頭，四，五，六木頭，七松子和半個松子。各樣材料大小，以松子爲標準。你們預備好各樣材料，先把木頭中間敲釘，如（一圖）。再和四，五，六木頭釘成一個丁字架子，如（二圖）。把兩張紙畫上一雙眼睛，如（三圖）。貼在半個松子的上面，眼睛下面，揷着一枝竹枝做嘴巴，再把兩枝竹，在春天比其他三季爲多。也就是「春天多內熱」的表現。現在因爲戲玩紙鳶，而不知不覺的排除內熱，這當然是好極了。不過，話又說回來了。能洩內熱，固然是紙鳶的好處，但是，愛頑紙鳶的小朋友，還有一點要記着。凡是戲玩紙鳶，總要背風仰視。如果要照上面張口望視的話，一定要在空氣新鮮地方才行。不可仰風奔跑。免得胃風而引起種枝挿在松子的末端做脚，把半個松子放在上面，就成一隻貓頭鷹玩具了！</p>

<p>— 林蔭</p>
<p>和小朋友們說起魚來，大家都興高采烈會得這樣回答：「魚是我愛吃的！」而且有許多小朋友告訴我，說他看見過許多種魚，在本刊上也曾經有朋友們寫過關於魚的文宇；這裏要告訴小朋友們的，還有幾種趣味的魚的生活。</p>
<p>你們看（圖一）的墨魚，它肚裏有個墨囊，能够製造墨汁，遇見有傷害它的動物時，它就放出墨汁來，使敵人看不見它，可以趁此機會逃走。和墨魚形狀相像的呌章魚。（圖二）它很愛美麗，常常會換新的衣裳。往往跟着天氣，日月的升降而變幻它的顏色。有時淡黃，有時月白，有時泥灰，有時草綠，你們想，這是多麼好玩呢！（圖三）所示的是星魚，它有一種特別的本領。它的身體分裂的時候，仍然可以繼續它的生命。你們假如把它扯成發片，依舊拋在水裏，等過着相當時期，扯去的部份，都如前長成，而且變做幾個星魚了。但是扯開以後，經過十五分時，它的生命，便不能再活。海馬魚（圖四）生得很特異，而且它的游泳方法，也完全和其他魚類不同，它的頭像馬頭，眼睛突出在外面，游泳的時候，身體是直豎起來的。尾巴像貓尾。在海浪衝擊的時候，就把尾巴勾住石子或海草以避危險。（圖五）是竹麥魚，它的胸鰭特別大，像兩面翅翼一樣，它有一種特異的技能，就是會唱，會呌，這是因有它的鰾很厚。兩塊鰾碰着，一收一放，便有咕哩咕哩的聲音發出來了。（圖六）的　魚，身體是大極了。有二丈多長，一千五百多鎊重，像一隻大鷄心形。它的尾巴很厲害，力氣也非常大，海船往往被它撞翻的。因爲海裏的小動物都怕它避它，因此它常用裝死的方法捕捉別種魚類充食物。</p>
<p>小朋友！海裏的魚類生活，是很有趣味的，你們可以多去研究研究，這裏不過是極普通的幾種罷了。</p>
<h3 id="c206">紙製的活魚 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 鳳</p>
<p>我知道，小朋友看了我這樣一個題目，一定以爲是哄騙人的，紙製的魚又那能活呢？不錯，紙製的魚，當然不會活。不過用一種方法，能使紙魚翻來覆去，看上去，好似和活魚一般的動着；你們想：這個玩意兒該是多麼够味啊！</p>
<p>方法容易得很，祇須拿一小條透明紙，（和玻璃一般的。）照着附圖，剪成魚樣就是了。</p>
<p>玩的時候，用半杯很熱的茶或開水，杯上罩一張紙，使熱氣不外洩；然後把魚放在紙上，那麽這條紙魚就在不停的活動了。</p>

<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>一天王召我前去，我到了他跟前，他說：「辛白德，我愛你，我心中以爲你應當娶一個妻，住在這裏，不要再想你目己的故鄉」。</p>
<p>自然、我須得照着王所說的做，於是他給了我一個朝中的富女為妻。</p>
<p>我在這地方住了多時，但我雖有了大財和一個高貴之妻，而我的生活總不能使我快樂。我的大願便是要回去一次，見我巴克達城中的親友，我的心中便裝滿了怎樣見他們的計畫。</p>
<p>我正在這樣想，我有一個朋友很悲苦的來瞧我，因爲他的妻剛死了。</p>
<p>我對他說我聽得了他的損失，心中很是憂悶</p>
<p>我說：「上帝許你長壽」。</p>
<p>他說：「休矣！你怎能想我能長壽呢？我沒有幾天可活了」。</p>
<p>我告訴他不可專向悲觀的方面看去，我很希望他能多活幾年咧。</p>
<p>當下他便說有一件奇事要告知我，我便從他那裹得知此地的法律，一個男子死了，他的妻定須和他一同放入墳中，要是一個爲妻的死了，伊的丈夫也須和伊的尸體同入墳中，只帶一壺水和幾個小麺包下去。</p>
<p>我聽得了這話，充滿了恐怖，因此我去問王，我並不是生在此地的，我的妻死了，這法律可能施及我。王和我說，我的妻死時，我也須和我那可憐的朋友一樣處置。</p>
<p>他說：「辛白德，凡是住　在此地的人，都須一樣辦的。我雖是王，倘我的后先死時，我也得和伊同去、所以你為甚麼不如此呢」？</p>
<p>我那朋友的亡妻埋入墳中的一天來了。伊穿着最好的衣服，載着珍貴的寶石。他們將伊的尸體送到一座高山的頂上；這裏有一個深壙，壙口有塊大石。</p>
<p>他們放下尸體去，接着我那可粦的朋友也入下去了，正發我先前听說的，帶着一瓶水和小麺包，於是那大石又回放在壙口，而我那朋友便和他的亡妻一同留着。</p>
<p>從此以後，我不做旁的事，只是守護着吾妻，伊要是害一些小病，我就充滿了恐怖。到後來我的恐怖實現了，伊竟一病而死。</p>

<p>紐約四月十八日電告一週棉市狀况云、本週棉價漲起之後、期棉轉跌、因覺市價再高、則現棉售出必增多也、星期四晶通告交割以前之五月期、多方了結、及國內棉廠產額續减、與華盛頓政策不定之消息、亦為抑低棉價之原因、棉價落時舟有倒限價之售出、嗣因同業購進、而空方亦於假前補進、市况乃較穩定、廢除手續捐之呼號、現仍存在、棉貨製造商之在京代表、日內將與羅總統晤談一切、棉帶西部種植進行不速但南部進行良好、多數報告、仍有農民對於减畝程序、完全合作之表示、棉貨市場買風漸减、但過去半個月之銷數、與近來產量相應、</p>

<p>粉市上午開盤後、各月份一致鬆跌、以洋麥停市無價、當開價時、因天色轉正、晴光大放、業內外人心、均因此鬆軟、兼之各廠拋售、頗見踴躍、市塲浮多脫手、臨時加空、故近遠各期、極度呈疲落不堪之象、較之前日收價、計跌二三四分不等、至本月份亦因客戶回出、亦難挺住矣、迨至下午開盤、以天時又復陰晴、氣候亦冷、恐須續雨、是以人心略振、較上午回好一分左右、以後則晴光稍放、市氣又見平和、觀目下之漲跌、與天之晴　、大有關係、故買賣方面、殊少把握、結果本月份跌二分、五月份跌一分七釐半、六月份跌二分七釐半、七月份跌二分二釐半、八月份跌一分七　半、九月份跌二分七釐半、</p>
<p>麥市上午開盤後、各月份呈近穩遠跌、以本月份轉瞬又須交割、市上現麥不多、洋麥則交貨者無幾、故開價依然老住、至逮期各月份、洋麥雖無報價、但天時已晴、人心不免鬆動、浮多脫乎、拋戶又見相接、故即跌五六分之譜、迨至下午開槃、交易仍暢、惟以陰雲密佈、恐有續雨之意、市氣遂轉定局、結果本月份不動、七月份跌四分、八月份跌三分、九月份跌五分，現麥市面、高貨又好一二分、中次亦穩、開山東白麥頴州麥四元零一二分、蚌埠麥四元、六合麥三元九角半、江北麥三元九角半、計四千包、由阜豐辦去、</p>

<p>洋客秈市况、仍形活潑、尤以內地胃口濃厚、辦興不褻、昨日全市開出洋米達二萬包、多數爲內地辦去、惟本街去化轉淡、長江帮未有問津、祇有內地單帮活潑、因此成交數不及前日之半、高洋米反見平軟、但中次各米爲內地暢辦、仍得站住、客秈貨乏站局、本街內地昨均暢辦糙秈、全日開一千八百包、市形有看好之象、</p>
<p>本米昨（滬南）各帮來源忽見轉旺、計到有四十餘號、（貨共八千餘石）、其銷塲自經前午呆化後、昨又到貨更旺、人心一餒、本街納胃愈覺懈淡、致成供過于求、回風猛向下游、若各厚粳價跌落二三角、晚稻雖續有包胃、靑島帮辦千餘包、然卒以大勢已軟、更因前朝價盤較爲提透、行情下削尤烈、竟有三四角之砠、陰元等至此遂亦難以立足、同見貶去二尺有奇、僅變元賴貨稀無甚榮辱耳、（滬北）昨日河下各帮到船二十餘號、市上各貨去路寥寥、市價白粳及早薄稻白元價小一二角、其餘各貨亦見修短、</p>

<p>日來麩皮市面、已轉定局、因前週以來、跌度已達二三角之巨、各廠方面、因成本關係、均思扳住不開、是以人心稍轉良好、各檔喊價二元三角八分、較前微好、惟存貨聞均豐厚、如洋莊不動、當看定局、</p>

<p>白蓮近以蘭谿地價降、而申市銷路亦稀、故市勢甚疲、行盤已降至三十八九元、比最高價前後降去十餘元之多、昨據地頭函訊、辦價爲三十六元、暫時看定、不再致降、</p>

<p>九十磅美新鐵、自新正到貨之後、此後即無現貨裝來、最近情形、因貨愈稀、而需求者愈廣、是以市上趨勢、十分良佳、行情因環境所趨、步步進步、計每箱估十六元、比前漲達五角之多、查成交達四五百箱之鉅、惟新近添辦者依然衆多、惜市上大有無貨可售之概、據各方面情形觀之、來日估盤、恐尙要再漲、</p>

<p>明媚的春光，是誘人的，也是惱人的。有閒人，固可乘此良辰美景，豪遊竟日，歌舞通宵，爲此明媚春光，點綴些花絮景色。然而這怡和的雰圍中，條有許多不甚諧和的曲調，這些在各種傳達消息的文字上，隨處可看到的。每日翻開報紙，覺得「殺」字在春來後的新聞中，特別活躍，大有殺氣冲天的景象。現在且拋開各種「被殺」的事件不談，專來研究一下自殺。</p>
<p>本月十一日中華日報上，載着一個全國各大城市的三月份自殺人數統計。（參看後面的自殺人數統計表）由那個統計表中，可發現兩個特徵。第一：自殺的人數，在通都大邑，如上海。廣州。杭州等，男多於女！反之。較偏僻的城市。如昆明。開封。武昌等。則女多於男。第二：自殺的原因，女的，大半爲家庭糾紛，只三月份總數爲三零八人，計占最多數。男子則大都由於生計困難。</p>
<p>上面這兩個特徵是相連繫的。這原因細分析起來，大都不外如下所述：因比較偏僻的城市，封建勢力，必較通都大邑，還依然强大。大家庭制度，依舊存在。老少一堂。新舊雜處。這裏不免思想上有衝突，生活上不合調，以及經濟上的利害衝突加以三從四德的訓條。尙爲家長與鄰里鄉黨的天經地義。這些都可以使一個弱者—被壓迫者，走七死路。又年來農村已陷於破產：偏僻的城市，亦瀕於沒落。男子十九離家拋妻奔向別的通商口岸。家中少婦，在此惱人春色中，也許未免多情，更有少年寡婦，偶露春意，也是性理中的常事。可是封建社會。將貞操的鎖鍊牢牢地鎖着女子。假使對這鎖鍊偶有損傷，免不了受着傷風敗俗的罪名。旣不能在鎖鍊下安分守已，又不能在封建勢力下做叛徒——做反封建的叛徒。只有自殺以了之。三妻四妾聚居一家，在舊社會裏，本不算一回事，這裏爭風吃醋，奪夫混戰中，敗北者無以爲生，亦只有一死。早婚已成習慣，三十以上尙沒有喜訊的姑娘，便已具備做老處女的資格。假使自己不能獨立，必嘗受雙重苦悶！性的苦悶與生活的苦悶。性的被抑壓，常易患「歇斯脫理病症或神經過敏，而以上的病症，正是造成家事糾紛的禍根。</p>
<p>此外這統計表上的自殺原因中，婚姻的不自由與失戀兩項，也是女多於男，所以在表面上看，女子的自殺，大都死於家庭，死於戀愛，似乎女子的氣量特別窄狹，僅區區家庭糾紛，就會尋死，似乎女子特別多情，不惜爲愛而犧牲性命。其實封建社會中的女子，她的天地，只有家庭，家庭也就是她的囚籠，她在囚籠裏犯法，不自殺只有逃出這囚籠，然而這不楚極强者所能做得到的。至於一般新女子，大都走入「戀愛至上」的牛角尖裏，戀愛是她的唯一生命，假使失敗，也只有一死以了之。這種死於家庭，死於戀愛的慘劇，情節當然非常複雜，但歸根索源，不外封建勢力與經濟問題而已。男子死於家庭糾紛與戀愛的人數不多，由於男子有前者的寬容。所以使男子自殺的只是經濟問題。</p>
<p>至於通都大邑，女子自殺人數，反少於男子，原因由於通商口岸至少稍稍受了資本主義的洗禮，封建勢力，已比較薄弱。所以中上層的婦女，只要經濟不成問題，社交尙比較自由，然而困於經濟的女子，仍享不到那種福利，所以，上海，廣州，北平等處，女子的自殺人數，比較少於男子。但數量上仍不在少數。</p>
<p>總之封建勢力在吃人，蒙上資本主義薄紗的社會，也在吃人，只是封建勢力的吃人，女多於男！</p>

<h3 id="c225">第五講中世對建社會的婦女　第一節封建制度與家族制度 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 君慧</p>
<p>我們爲着正確的理解中世紀（第四世紀—第十五世紀）封建社會的婦女地位，必須先明暸這社會的經濟的生產關係及社會制度，尤其是家族制度。</p>
<p>首先，我們要知道，前講所述的古代奴隸勞動制社會是如何轉變到封建的農奴制社會而且這種社會的轉變，對於婦女是有如何影饗的問題。</p>
<p>創造了莊嚴燦爛的文明的古代社會，是以高度發展的羅馬帝國爲最後階叚，到了西紀四，五世紀時終於崩壞了。其主要原因：</p>
<p>第一，奴隸勞動的生產技術，受私有財產制度的限制，不能發達，</p>
<p>第二，在奴隸勞動生產的壓迫之下，自由農民及手工業者日瀕破產，</p>
<p>第三，在無限制的壓榨底下，奴隸的死亡率激增，出生率銳减，奴隸價格高漲，奴隸來源枯竭。</p>
<p>第四，奴隸們的叛亂迭起，頹廢了的自由民已無力維持社會秩序。</p>
<p>這樣，曾經助長了社會的生產力的發展之奴隸制度，到此時，反而成爲妨害生產力的發展桎梏了。於是，從這舊社會的胎內打破其桎梏而孵化出來的新的社會形態，就是中世封建的農奴制社會。</p>
<p>農奴制社會和奴隸制社會，在本質上是同樣的東西。農奴是由被釋放的奴隸，破產的自由民及被征服地域的人民所構成的，封建社會的主要生產者，他和奴隸不同之點在於奴隸是直接隸屬於主人，而他是隸屬於主人所領有的土地之上，因此，農奴制度可以說是緩和了的奴隸制度！也可以說是奴隸和近代勞動者之中間形態。</p>
<p>封建的社會制度的特徵，是被征服的土地全歸爲大領主（國王）之所有，大領主把自己直轄區域以外的土地爲封地或領地而分給小領主（諸侯），小領主再把牠分給家臣（幕僚）家臣再把牠分給農奴，這樣，大領主，小領主，家臣，農奴之間有君臣主從的絕對的命令關係，而以服從軍役爲主要義務。農奴是從事農業，在其全部生產中，除了最低限度的生活資料外，都貢納於領主，而且沒有移住及職業自由之權，他和土地一併被賣買，離開了土地，就失去了生存的地盤。當時手工業及商業不甚發達，封鎖的自然經濟支配着整個社會生活。</p>
<p>建築在這種社會的經濟基礎上面的家族制度，也是以絕對的從屬關係爲其特徵。妻對夫，子女對父母，家族對家長的關係，正和農奴對領主的關係同樣，都有絕對的服從關係，而這種關係是以法律，宗敎，道德，敎育等制度來使之合理化，正當化！</p>
<p>在古代奴隸勞動制時代，已經被驅入於家庭的婦女，到了封建時代，更受着種種制度的束縛，完全失掉了「人」的地位，例如「三從四德，七出」等，都是一般封建國家的拘束婦女的典型的道德律，尤其封建的家族制度是把婦女置於絕對的男權支配之下，作成了男子的終身奴隸，俗語說：「嫁雞隨雞，嫁狗隨狗」，這是最深刻的表現封建社會婦女的地位與痛苦！</p>
<p>在封鎖的自然經濟時代，家庭的經濟的任務非常重大，牠是封建國家的社會有機體的一個細胞，經濟的生產的一單位，一個家族財產的統一與鞏固，是維持封建國家的主要條件，因此，在封建社會裏，家長的權威特別加强，全家族都無條件的服從於家長的命令。</p>
<p>封建法律，是爲着保全代代相傳的家產，採用長子制度，依這制度，家長死後的遺產可由家長的長子承繼，因此家長是非常的重視其長子。假使主婦不生兒子，則不單受家庭的虐待，並受社會的歧視。在德國某地方，自治體法律是規定不能生兒子的男子，使其妻和隣人發生關係以得後繼者。中國的租妻納妾等亦多半藉口無子的。</p>
<p>封建國家是把家庭作爲獨立主體，而使各個人絕對的從屬於家庭，並且防止家庭的一切變動，這理由有二，第一要使家庭作爲最有效的生產的經濟上的細胞，第二，要使家庭繁殖而促進人口的增加。</p>
<p>封建時代的家族形態，自然不能以統一的概念來觀察牠的！在這社會裏，有種不同的階級集團，如領主，騎土，手工業者，商人，農民等，他們各有不同的社會生活，而其家族關係亦各有相異。我想，在本講中，從各階級的經濟活動，他們的社會生活乃至他們的家庭及結婚形式中去觀察封建社會的婦女地位。</p>

<p>— 芳</p>
<p>江北各縣的婦女生活，若是不經過連年的天災人禍，平常是很能過得去的，但近幾年以來，她們直過着知識階級的婦女所想像不到的地獄生活哩！</p>
<p>在縣城附近的一些農婦，因受不了這種地獄生活的壓迫，便跑到城裏去僱傭，去過那奴隸生活，淮，徐，海，揚一帶的農婦們，所住的地方，大都是日光不足，而又潮濕狹隘的茅屋，窗子也非常的小，屋寡的佈置也很簡單，若是貧困些一的，在這一所茅草房屋裏便做了許多的用途，如爐灶與鍋碗等侏具便堆在這茅舍的一角。每當煮飯燒菜的時候，便黑烟迷漫了全尾如濃霧一般，甚至於對面不能辨出人的面目來，因爲鄉村所燒的東西，大都是樹葉子稻草，麥楷及豆莖等物，一着火即化爲烏有，煮一頓飯不知要燒多少，又因為灶口、同時要從上面出烟，又要容納那些不經火的物質，所以煮一頓飯，便把人一烟」得要死，若是在夏天，更熱得沒命，也就是她們所常說的：「穿着乾布衫子進去，濕布衫子出來，」於此可見熱的程度一斑了，有時在灶的旁邊堆滿了那些燒火的東西，在門的後邊，有時還設一個鷄架，是專備鷄宿的地方，架子下邊堆着一堆一堆的鷄架，每當陰天下雨的時候，便有一種奇味襲來，使人難於呼吸，她們因爲習以爲常，也不感覺什麼痛苦，但是也有在院裹特爲鷄砌的鷄窩，在這小小的茅屋裏，除了她們的床舖以外，還有些雜糧也堆在一角，逢到下雨的時候，便又把一些柴火拿進屋裏去，在這時候屋裏簡直是沒有落足的地方，這樣從那裏還能講到整潔和衛生呢？在鄉間的一切廢物，在她們的眼中都是很可貴的，如灶底下的灰與洗鍋碗的一些髒水，以及糞穢等，她們都特別的在院子裏挖一個坑儲存起來，以備明年春天撒到田裏去，所以一到夏天，便奧氣四溢，因此牠就成了一切傳染病的發源地，蚊蚋的滋生也特別厲害，江北的瘧疾特盛，我想這也是其中的原因之一。</p>
<p>至於說到她們的睡眠時間，更沒有一定，在農忙的時候，也許整夜不睡，也許到深晚十二時才入陲，而第二天早上三四點鐘就起身，每到陰歷四五月時，那正是割麥的季節，差不多早晨三點多鐘的時候，就忙着到田裹去工作，直到晚上才一拐一拐的拖着疲倦的身體走回來，假如有小孩子的，都把他們放在家裏，也沒有人照顧，到渴了餓了的時候，便拿起什麼就吃什麼，甚至髒水也都成了她們很重要的食料或飲料，有的在家裹忙着燒水，做飯或担着水往田裏去灌溉，眞是忙個不休。</p>
<p>割完麥子以後，她們才可以得些閑暇了，在這時候她們又利用這閑暇時間，領着年輕的姑娘，用麥莖編些草帽辮子或提包，籃子等用具到城裏去出賣，以便換幾個錢補助她們的家庭或做爲自己的私蓄，或用這些錢買點新的裝飾品，她們是最能利用閒暇的，不管他是痛苦不痛苦，一有點空便找工作去做，編過草帽辮以後，便忙着拆洗舊棉衣或被褥，或趕着做些鞋襪，以備她們的丈夫及小孩子們冬天之用。</p>
<p>等到一切莊稼都收割完了以後，她們便忙着軋棉花，紡紗，織布，以備做衣服用，所以你若是冬天到江北各縣的鄉村去，往往在深夜，仍聽見「嗯！嗯！嗯！」的彈花聲「嗡！嗡！嗡！」的紡紗聲以及」嘩！嘩！嘩！」的往來穿梭聲，她們勤苦的情形，由此也可以想見一般了！</p>
<p>至於她們所用以取亮的燈，差不多仍是十八世紀時所用的豆油燈，或棉籽油燈，間或用煤油燈，但那總是少數的少數，雖用煤油燈，但是用玻璃燈罩的却很少見。飲食也是很簡單的，她們終年很少有吃肉食的機會，大概都是一些蔬菜粗飯，當新麥子收完以後，她們有點機會吃些粗的麥子麵和一些野菜，因爲他們園田中的蔬菜，都捨不得吃，以便挑到城鎭中去換些糧食回來度日，至於我們，城市中通常所用的一些作料，如油，鹽，醬，醋，等，她們都把牠看做很可貴的東西，用香油調菜的時候，是用一只筷子，一端綁上一個帶孔的小制錢，在油罐裹一醮便使牠滴到菜裏去，在往常吃飯的時候，差不多都用點冷水搗些大蒜及辣椒，或大葱，便可以完成她們的一頓飯，她們除非在喜慶葬喪大事，或新年之外，很少見肉腥，連老年人也不能例外，她們平常所喝的水，也大半是白開水，間或用些竹葉或槐葉在水裏泡一泡，使白水變一變顏色而已，在忙的時候，她們就喝些冷水來解渴而已。</p>
<p>假如你想知道江北徐，淮，海，一帶的婦女，那一個是否出嫁爲人的賢妻良母，那是很容易辨認的，你只要看她們的頭髮，是否盤髯，或是有狠長的辮子，即可分曉，因爲江北各縣鄉村的風俗，是凡已出嫁的年輕少婦，都盤着一個髮髻在頭的後部，沒有出閣的姑娘，都是保一條很長的髮辮在背後，有時候頭上蒙着上塊藍布或手巾，以避日光，或汚塵灰砂，平時裝飾品很少，除非出嫁或過新年時，很少帶了花或簪子的，現在江北纏足之風，已不大盛行，並有放足委員會的組織，禁止纏足，如有故意違反，處罰她赤了足遊街示罰，這種辦法倒是很有效的。</p>
<p>江北的農村婦女，便在這樣的川流不息的在痛苦中過去。</p>

<h3 id="c228">原理及其適用性 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 張堅</p>
<p>當我們研究問題，思維乃至認識事象時，不能不有一種規範來約制和領導我們的思維，使我們的思維能够循一定軌道去比較，推論別的事象，而達到認識它的究竟。這種規範是來自人類的歷史，當前的社會，或爲個人之不斷的經騐所發展了的知識之中，成爲比較根本的理論的公式，此種理論的公式，通常是把它呌做原理。</p>
<p>對於這種原理的適用性，人們是沒有一定的見解的。專門注重演繹推理的學者，是把原理看成唯一重要的東西，以爲只要從一個旣定原理出發，甚麼都可以由它推演出來。一切宇宙的，社會的，道德的法則，都有一個恒久如一的根本原理，以後的發展只是這根本原理在實在的事物上顯現成爲現實的形態而已。比如眞，善，美這些東西，都是超時間空間的預存原則。在今天的人類和往古的人類，在地球上和別的星球上都是一樣，眞的，善的，美的東西就是眞的，善的，美的，不能把不眞，不善，不美的當作眞的，善的，美的；也不能這時是眞的，善的，美的，在別的時間空間又不是了。我們認識事物，只要獲得了這些根本永恒的原理，就可以由它去推知一切，並且是完全可以担保無誤的。</p>
<p>在專六注生歸納的推進的學者，特別是以現實事象的經騐為境界的研究家，則又一般的輕視原理、他們以為新的東西旣只能存在於新的事象之中，那末，要獲得新的知識，就只有實地去經騐一件一件單一的新事象，才有可能。因爲私未經騐它們以前，旣然連新事象的本身都還不知道，又如何能對它發生一種知識呢？由已知的原理去推論事象，無論你如何推論，還是只能自限於在原理本身上打迴旋，並推演不出新的知識來，所以原理在研究中是不必要的。</p>
<p>我們要理解在研究上是否需要原理，以及原理的適用程度的問題，首先就得理解事物之相互間的關係，和人類知識之歷只的過程這兩個重要問題、就宇宙的事物來說，每一個事物，那怕是最特別的事物，它們都旣是個別的，又是屬於全體的，旣有獨具的特別性質，也有在一定限度內和別的事物具備着相同的類的性質存在着。因此，卻配它自身的法則，也旣有其自己的特珠法則，亦有其一般的法則。如果我們所獲得的原理，是這裏所說的一般的類的法則時，這原理將為屬於這一一般的和類的任何單一事物所不能踰越的範圍，是很明顯的。。旣然如此，則縱令那些單一的事物尚是未曾投入我們的經騐範圍內的東西，這原理也仍然可以卻配它，而由此原理推演到已知的界限以外，企圖在那裏獲得新的東西，便不是絕對不可能的事體。而且我們的研究和認識也絕對不能在任何原理都不根據中便可認識外界。比如我們要認識馬是哺乳動物，至少也要根據以乳甫也的子為那一最初原則，才認定也是甫乳動物，雖然這甫乳動物的觀念，仍是由以乳哺牠的兒子的許多事實歸納出來的。人類知識之長期的累積，經騐之逐漸的儲蓄，不管它是不是絕對正確，但它就是指導我們認識與研究的原理。如果說我們的研究完全不需要原理，則歷史上的知識不是完全變成無用了嗎？然而在事實上如果離了它，我們就不易研究一切了。</p>
<p>但是，存在於客觀事物中的法則，縱然我們不管它自身是不是變化的（實際上其自身也隨事物的變化而變化），但就人類對它的認識說，則受着種種限制，特別是受着歷史發展的階叚，社會的條件的限制。因此，人類知識的完美性是不能一次完成的，甚至要在無限進步中去完成，所以原理也不能成爲絕對正確和不變的東西。假如我們迷信原理，不把原理拿來和不斷運動的現實事象相對應證騐，那麼，這原理在不長進的條件下將失其作用，不能作爲指導我們認識事物的工具，所以原理是要變動的，能修改的。但是拿甚麼東西去修改它呢？又要甚麼東西才能使它變動呢？這就要靠新的事象之觀察，現實的事象之經騐的結果了，因此要原理也要事實的觀察與經騐來補充。</p>
<p>可是，我們在這裏不是說任何性質的原理都對於我們的研究有其必要性。原理要對於研究具有指導的必要性，首先就得要這原理是從客觀事實中抽象出來的結果，是研究的結果，而不是根據原理自身以爲研究出發點並由此再生產出來的結果。一種空虛的幻想的原理和其再生產的任何產品，以其不能適應自然和歷史的綠故，因而沒有正確性。如果它要呌自然和社會來適應它，那就必然要遭它們的拒絕，而我們也就不能根據它以爲研究的出發點。反之，如果是爲現實所反映而成的原理，那這原理在出生的開始就是研究的結果。所以，若以它作爲研究的指示器，這便不是以原則爲研究的出發點，而是以先行闖入人類認識圈內的事物法則，去推演和尋求那爲客觀的一般的和其類的法則所統率的別的未知物。這樣的原理在研究中不但有必要，而且也要它才有能力指導我們去認識新事物。</p>
<p>總之，能够指導我們的認識和研究的原理，它是經騐的產物；但它一經產生以後，也就反轉來支配我們去再經騐，這再經騐又回頭來不斷地充實和改進原理，把它推向更高的發展階段。如此，則眞實的原理不但不是絕對不變的，而且它倒還要在演變中使自己更加正確，更加科學化，更在認識和研究中演其重要的作用。那些不要原理與拘守死的原理的人，都是不會研究事象，認識動的外界的人。</p>

<h3 id="c229">鳥啼花落又一春 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 君慧</p>
<p>「春眠不覺曉，處處聞啼烏，夜來風雨聲，花落知多少？」當這醉人的三春，住在這風光旖旎的玄武湖上，很容易想起這首哀感的詩句。然而我並不愛牠，反覺得牠是「春殘」，「花落」的祭文。我愛慕年靑的春天，不願意牠衰老。我愛惜新鮮的花朶，不願意她凋謝。因此我最怕背誦這篇「祭文」。</p>
<p>住在湖上快要兩月了。雖然少聽着「烏啼」，却見着一次「花落」。大概十幾天前吧，嫩紅的櫻桃花，裝點得玄武湖十分美麗，尤其是我窗外的幾株年靑櫻桃樹，所放的花兒更活潑，鮮艷；每一開窗，便覺得她在向我微笑。那微笑呵，比少女的笑靨，還使人陶醉啦。那時我的理想是；可愛的花呵，我要保護你求久存在，不讓別人來摧殘你。可是當天夜間，我先聽着風掀窗櫺，隨又聽着雨擊窗紙，我那一顆赤熱的心，馬上就顫動起來：擔心若純潔的幼弱的花朶，將受風雨的汚染，侵襲。然而我又自已勸解：風雨雖然殘暴，也許不會欺凌無辜的花朶；花兒雖然幼弱，她也有倔强的個性和年靑的力氣，也許可以抵抗吧。於是我安然的合着眼晴，追求夢裏的安慰！</p>
<p>明天的早上，太陽的金光已經酒滿了全屋，我纔骨碌的跳下床來。沒有梳洗的閑暇，趕快推開窗櫺，當我推窗的剎那間，滿心以爲經過洗禮的花兒定比往日更嬌艷了，可是我的眼睛剛馳騁到園林，視綫所接觸到的不是往日的「笑靨」，而是含愁的病容。這時我雖陷入驚恐的深淵裏，然而也疑惑自己的眼睛看不眞確；於是趕快跳出窗戶，三步兩步跑到櫻花樹前，對於一樹一枝都作一番過細的巡禮。花兒眞的脫落得很多，枝條上祇剩下稀疏的帶病的殘朵！隨又巡視地面，便發現無數的花瓣正對着我流眼淚。還有許多屍體，已給污泥掩沒，情景十分令人傷感。這時我深覺自愧：像我這樣愛花而不能保護花的生命，到底不是眞正的愛花者。雖然我曾自命爲花的保護人，但究竟沒有盡着保護的責任！</p>
<p>不過我始終是愛花的，一方面傷悼窗外的花兒的慘死，同時也擔心別處的花兒的命運。於是我抱着酸楚的心，勉强作全湖的巡禮。可是走遍各處的櫻桃林，都祇見着殘缺的空枝，還有那些零落的花瓣，一片一片的躺在地下喘氣，嘆息！最後我走上一個頂高的土堆，移動眼睛廻視全湖：映入眼廉的不是往日的嬌艷，美麗，而是慘淡的愁容。對着這蕭條的淸凉的景况，再也忍不住心裏的酸痛。本想收拾花屍作一番虔誠的埋葬，可是這又未免兒女態了。同時我又想到花屍的暴露，正足以顯示風雨的殘暴：牠一夜的淫威竟斷送了無數幼弱的生命！</p>
<p>踏上歸途，聽着「陽烏」不住的悲鳴，那一聲一聲的啼呌，彷彿在傳播花兒的惡耗。這時我眞忍不住心裏的氣忿，不禁暗暗的駡道：</p>
<p>「你這油嘴巧舌的小烏呵，誰要你來傳播兇信？昨夜暴風雨逞淫威時，你躲到那兒去了？把你那假慈悲，收拾過去吧！」</p>
<p>現在桃李的花又盛開了。桃花是鮮紅的，李花是潔白的，這紅白相兼的顏色，把整個玄武湖裝扮得愈是美麗燦爛。我每天都在這花團錦簇中躑躅蹁躚；一方面可充個護花使者，同時也得領略花的芳香，玩賞花的嬌容，我的心境是多麼的快樂呵！</p>
<p>可是對着這新鮮活潑的花朵，我又想到零落的花瓣。前兒的櫻桃花不是一樣的新鮮活潑嗎？但是經過一夜風雨便成了零碎的屍體。今天的桃花，李花是這麼新鮮，活潑，安知明天不變成另外一種姿態？假如今夜再來一次風雨，那結局又將怎樣呢？</p>
<p>風雨是沒有情感的，牠的殘暴是沒有休止的，假如牠高興施逞淫威，柔弱的花兒便是給牠蹂躪的對象了！前兒的櫻桃花活生生的犧牲在牠的淫威下，今兒的桃花，李花難道可望牠的寬恕嗎？我這一顆赤熱的心，眞爲她們擔憂呵！可是我雖替她們擔憂，同時也氣惱她們過分的嬌弱：她們祗知道與同類爭妍，門媚，全不想法去抵禦外界的暴力，她們祗有美麗的姿容，沒有强烈的生命，祇有屈服的惰性，沒有奮鬥的精神。</p>
<p>然而我始終是愛她們的。但是單單一個「愛」字，也不能超脫她們惡劣的命運。現在已是暮春了，她們的生命恰發展到項點，假如一旦遭受風雨的摧殘，那整個花國就要滅族，而且春天也要同時宣告破碎了！所以我近來每當淸晨聽着「烏啼」，便以爲花兒的兇信傳來了，於是趕忙推開窗戶，審視昨夜是否吹風下雨。因爲我的經處是：烏之所以啼泣，不是傳播「花落」的惡耗，便是報告暴風雨將要到來。因此我最怕聽着烏啼，也怕記起「祭文」似的詩句——「春眠不覺曉，處處聞啼烏，夜來風雨聲，花落知多少？」</p>

<p>自從工業革命以後，都市念激膨漲，田園日益荒廢。然而都市生活實是一種純機械性的，是反自然的不健全的。所以現在社會上發生一個很大的問題：就是如何使都市而具有鄉村的樂趣與如何使鄉村而兼有都市的利益。爲要達到這個目的，不能不使「都市鄉村化」與「鄉村都市化」，而新村制度就應這需要而產生了</p>
<p>英國工商業的發達，較世界各國爲最早，所以英國都市之需要改造亦較他國爲最要，新村之創設，就首先由英國濫觴。歐戰前英國新村數目已達五十以上。近來歐陸各國亦繼之而有新村建設</p>

<p>協會的組織。如德國設協會於柏林，設支部於各地。法國亦設本部於巴黎，其支部更推廣及於比利時，荷蘭等國。在歐陸經營新村成績最佳的，爲普魯土的愛森市克虜伯鐵工塲的工人新村。其次為美利堅布爾滿車輛公司工廠主人布爾滿所創建的新農村，其建築構造，專以整潔爲主，凡住宅必附以庭園，使四季花木不絕，實一最美麗的新村。</p>
<p>新村運動今已有風靡全世界之勢。新村之建設於歐陸各國以及南北美洲，印度，日本等國者，日見增多。回顧我國，雖工商業的發達尙遲緩，但都市的弊害已甚顯著。今日我國政府要圖，首在設法避免都市的罪惡，所以新村的建設，實爲亟不可緩。五四以後，雖經周作人氏竭力鼓吹，給與國人以新村運動的印象，惜至今仍無眞正新村出現。</p>
<p>自中國新村建設社和新華銀行分別創立新村以後，全國人士均極注意。查該社所創建之第一新村，名爲「薔薇園新村」，闢地百畝於滬閔公路奚家塘，與江蘇省立上海中學爲近鄰。現已開工建造，卽將落成之住宅，約十餘所。其與上海租界之交通，則有滬閔公路，該村並自備公共汽車，來往行駛於本村與南京路外灘間。除交通外，其他住戶之公用設備，如自來水，電燈，電話，郵政，市塲，等俱備。其公共事業方面，如敎育，則有完全小學一所，附設幼稚園，並籌設圖書館及運動塲。衛生方面，特設衛生社（等於小規校之醫院），以擘畫公衆之保健事業。加以該村建築計劃本爲一花園式之村市，有曠地數十畝，均遍植樹木花卉，且特聘設計師佈置一切。村內另設公園，以資住戶遊息。又爲改進經濟生活起見，特倡行合作事業。一面聯絡各住戶發起組織合作事業促進會，一面設立家務補助團，以推進家庭合作事宜。另設家庭工藝室，爲村中婦女造服務之機會，聘請村內精於家庭工藝之主婦，負責指導育蠶，治絲，養蜂釀蜜，及紡織，刺繡，結綫，裁縫等工藝，以充實婦女生活之意義。</p>
<p>住宅的工程設計，外表採現代式；平衡的佈置，採凸凹覆連式。住宅獨立，各有私用花園。但又很重視全村景色，使它成爲一貫，形成一個大的庭園。無論遠觀近看，都無空曠和阻滯之弊。住宅內部結構，是從舒適合用着想，不浪費也不過於湫隘侷促。並决定在村的中心地建造一座宏大壯麗的公民堂，作住戶們婚喪喜慶或平時公共聚會的塲所，希望可以激勵住戶們自動組織各種俱樂部和會社，使全村有互助協作的精神。在警備方面，除在村的四圍築高丈餘的堅密籬笆外，順着滬閔公路的一部分已築就鐵欄圍牆。上海縣政府在該村門首百步左右特建有碉堡一座，並將設一警察分駐所於該村大門前常川駐守。</p>
<p>起初，該社公布第一步計劃，規定薔薇園新村住宅爲ABC三種，爲供住戶自由選擇起見，每級又分三種式樣，A級三種規定價格爲每宅九千元，佔地一畝。B級三種規定價格爲一萬二千元，佔畝亦一畝，只是房間較多。C級三種定價一萬八千元，佔地二畝。以上價格，述（一）地價，（二）造價，（三）衛生設備，（四）私用花園及地面植物，（五）村中公共建築物（包括道路，禮堂，圖書室，運動塲，公園，衛生社，小學校，幼稚園，公廚，新村管理處，警察所，市塲等）（六）村中公共設備（包括公共汽車，電燈，電話，自來水，消防用具等）一併鴉入在內。訂購住宅者，先選定已劃分好的基地，位置及房屋式樣。（該社另備有總地盤圖樣，住宅圖樣及各種參考岡表）可以估計自己的經濟力量，採用一次付欽或分期付欵的方法。這種分期付欵的方法，實際上和在上海租屋住的人按月繳付租金一樣。先付地價及保證金約計總價四分之一，以後可隨自己的意思從兩年至十年按月拔還。但是，普通繳付租金，漫無限制的要永久負祖下去，定購薔薇園新村住宅，則可自定付租年限，到期便可獲得房地產所有權。因此，自第一步計劃公布後，訂建住宅者已數十起。後來該社爲謀普及都市薪給階級和鑒於各業不景氣，爲减輕無限期每月繳租者負担起見，再公布第二步普及計劃。</p>
<p>第二步普及計劃之住宅分爲DE兩級。每級又分兩式。建築形式內外均美觀堅固。僅須預先繳付定建費五六百元，以後卽可分年按月繳付租金，照預定合同於若干年滿期付淸租金，卽可取得房地產所有權。此項辦法名爲「訂建租賃定期取得房地產所有權一付欺辦法。最長期限十二年，最短一年。D種房產與上海市內之雙開間洋式往宅頗相似，但佔地半畝，衛生設備及私用花園俱備；E種則類似市內之單幟小洋房，但爲雙開間平頂式，亦佔地半畝，衛生設備及私用花園俱備。據說現在訂建租賃DE種房屋者極多，因爲所出租價旣比在市內的减少，而生活和環境又比市內的要舒適幽美得多。</p>
<p>最近，本市著名銀行如國華，四行儲蓄會等和它們的各分行，均樂爲該社代辦定戶訂購事業，使新村運動的倡導更增社會信仰。並且，該社對於新村基地之擴充和建設新村的合作投資方面，也有極新頴的貢獻。現在該社已宣布了、新村房屋合作投資的特創辦法，想使呆滯之資金，可得一安全的用途。他們把投資新村房產辦法，分爲兩種：（一）任意投資，這種投資並不固定數目，以國幣五百元爲最少數，投資人可估計自己的財力，自行確定數目。（二）整宅投資，可根據新村往宅種類斟酌認定投資數目，但一人投資至多以十宅爲限。這一種投資方法，是採取住戶合作制。事前旣本和衷共濟之精神，住戶一方訂建租賃期滿可得房地產所有權，而投資人方面又無空租之盧。有了定建租賃房屋的人，才徵求合作投資，則供求平衡。又可聽憑自己意思，預定年限。等於以笨重的房產，換成有價的蹬券。同時，從救濟行將破產的農村方面說，也是以呆資發展生產事業的唯一途徑。新村是一個模範鄕村，不特改善溷濁的都市住居，且可使鄉村逐漸科學化。有新村來疏散商塲的積財，以慰藉市　湫隘的煩苦。平時無事，人事與商况，可以得到調劑，不致有財產聚集無處用的憂慮；遇有戰爭或重大天災，因爲守望和防禦都成習慣，團結協作互相援瞧，全市精華也不致因集中一處處而全被燬壞。歐戰時的英國和大地震時的日本，若不是因爲新村——田園的都市衆多，恐怕早已演成全市覆滅的大慘劇了。</p>

<p>這美麗的故鄉殘破了。這有蒼翠的景色孕育着的故鄉，這有二千多人在那裏幻着美夢的故鄉，這有着無數代祖宗先人活動遺跡的故鄉，這有櫛比的廬舍和美麗的田園的故鄉，殘破了。</p>
<p>金生往後望了一眼，想起了自己的家，眼眶裏不覺流下淚來。</p>
<p>坐在船頭上的張凌甫暴呌起來：「他媽的，人家的船早過塘灣了，你不顧我們一船人的死活。」</p>
<p>船也轉過塘灣了。向來行人稀少的大路，今日也有成羣結隊連奔帶跑的行人。</p>
<p>金生看見阿江叔，傴僂着背，駝着兩條笨重的棉被，夾在人叢中，蝸牛樣的蠕動着。這上年紀的人，被年靑人遺落在後面了，那老頭兒脚步突的停下來了，那傴僂的弓背也不見了，金生正在奇異，那老兒又負着傴僂的背向前，可是那背上的物件，像减少了一半。</p>
<p>又是一個女人，像李小弟的女人，背上負着小孩，右手裏又帶着一個較大的孩子，這孩子不習快跑，哭，呌，凄厲的激盪着脆薄的空氣，做母親的仍艱難的拖着他跑。</p>
<p>大路愈靠近河岸了。金生看見岸上有零零落落被　緊的大包小袱、爲了長途負不起沈　的衣物。又不能不被拋棄的。</p>
<p>—哇，……哇……姆……</p>
<p>兩歲大的小女孩，正如衣物一樣命運，被丟棄在菜田裏，聲音沙啞了，沒有人願意帶着她走。</p>
<p>—噲，阿江叔，逃到那裏呀，兒子媳婦怎麽不帶着走。金生提高嗓子問那堤上的。</p>
<p>阿江悽然的喘着氣。</p>
<p>—各自逃命啊，屋子裏吃了×洋人的炸彈呢！</p>
<p>—上那兒呢？</p>
<p>—上那兒，上陸家宅避風。</p>
<p>—噲噲，阿江叔，西市梢張家……噲噲，就是張凌甫家，沒有什麽吧！</p>
<p>張凌甫發着破鑼兒般的聲音。</p>
<p>—莫說起，莫說起，炸彈像烏蛋，鳥蛋，一囂十數顆掉下來，喚，西市梢，還好，壞的是市中心裏。</p>
<p>阿江說着這話後，西市梢的人微微露着欣喜，可是市中心的都念得面色慘白。</p>
<p>—噲，阿江叔，我們</p>
<p>大前街李……噲</p>
<p>—我呢張德隆……阿</p>
<p>江叔！</p>
<p>—阿江……</p>
<p>七嘴八舌，阿江是無法應付了，只大聲呌道：</p>
<p>—林文德是炸死了，眞慘哪，那條石直飛到城隍廟大塲上，挿下三尺深，林文德屍體無處找尋…</p>
<p>—啊呀，都是爲了小學堂裝他媽的報時鐘，他媽的，太高了，惹人注意啦！</p>
<p>—眞的，你看飛機不是總盤旋在那頂上嗎？</p>
<p>聲音在堤岸上下熱鬧起來。</p>
<p>船上人和岸上人是用的高聲談話，船上人跟船上人也用較低的聲浪談論着。女子們話匣子全開了。</p>
<p>女人們想到還有什麽什麼東西，貴重的有用的東西沒拿走，怨恨自己昏了腦，啊，首飾也沒帶着走。想着想着，說着說着，悔恨和愛惜交迸，張凌甫女人哭了。</p>
<p>張凌甫駡道：「操他媽的，你這女人要算頂沒鳥用，姓張的也算數盡。」</p>
<p>同舟的人都被這對夫婦吸引着，聽到這裏，大家笑了；可是再想到自己，來日大難，立刻又歛了笑聲，重被憂愁襲擊着。</p>
<p>婁河又拐灣了。</p>
<p>舟中人只能見到那羣人在山岡似的堤上起伏上落，過一會，都不見了。</p>
<p>—金生，我們揀一個偏僻的葦塘，去伏一伏，通了今宵，再作道理！</p>
<p>—是哪，我們不能離家太遠，太遠了，我們靠着什麽活呢？</p>
<p>天氣冷了些，大家威到一點寒峭，天色垂暮了。</p>
<p>金生將船靠到生有竹林的那面岸旁，旁邊早有一隻同樣命運的船停泊在那裏。</p>
<p>船繫了</p>
<p>年靑人整天沒把骨骼舒服過，都跳上岸去向婁鎭張望，一望茫茫原野的盡頭，黑暗仍舊迷漫着。</p>
<p>在蒼茫的夜色裏，並可看出紅光在上昇着。</p>

<p>遇着這種時侯，他在飽辱了他的年長者去後，從污溝裏拾起塗了泥的詩集，拂一拂弄穢了的衣服上的塵土，便投身於Thams河畔的牧塲的靑草上，仰視高聳雲霄的Winzer宮殿，俯瞰如鏡的流水。</p>
<p>這時在他的手中持着的是哥特文（WilliamGodwin）的一卷政治的正義（PoliticalJustice）。冥想着人間社會的悲慘和不正義，他宣誓：</p>
<p>「我爲正大賢明的自由誓：我誓不爲利己者和權力者的臣下，舉我自己的一生獻給爲了美的崇拜。」</p>
<p>少年的思想支配一生。雪萊的一生爲這河畔之誓而奮鬭。</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>他的祖父富於奇癖，和他同樣也是不住在家裏的。他的父親是位典型的英國人，是位平凡的人，只知隨世俗而浮沉。母親呢，却以剛健的男性爲理想，厭惡她的長男帶着書到林間冥想。然而三個妹妹對於她們的哥哥却像神似的崇拜，愛撫。</p>
<p>十八歲的時候，他進了牛津大學。</p>
<p>他簡直像孩子似的生活着。肉的厭惡者的他，無論何時，衣袋裏都是滿裝着餅乾和麵包的。走在路上的時候，一面嗟達嗟達的吃着，一面讀着書。不知晝夜的生活着。</p>
<p>在這時，他開始寫小說和論文。而且印刷了他的著作無神論的必然（TheNecessityofAtheism），陳列在大學附近書店的店頭。</p>
<p>翌日，他被校長和學生監呌了去，宣吿：</p>
<p>「開除！」</p>
<p>一起被開除的有他的知友荷克（TheamesJeffersonHogg）。他們一起到倫敦來租了房子開始生活。庸碌的父親看見兒子被開除了，覺得於自己顏面悠關，便到倫敦去强迫兒子改過。若不回心轉意，便斷絕給養。雪萊拒絕了父親的希望，於是像預定的那樣被斷絕給養。</p>
<p>這是他一生貧乏的開始。</p>
<p>不久，荷克聽從他父親的勸吿，捨他而去，在廣茫的倫敦，囊無分文的他被拋棄了。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c234">廖化作先鋒 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 石熊</p>
<p>還在童年時代，看過一部三國演義的傳奇。因爲那時年齡尙幼稚，又因相隔年代已久了，所以故事大多已模糊不情。不過不知什麼緣故，那一段蜀國將要滅亡前的掙扎情况，則依稀尙有印象。</p>
<p>孔明六出祁山，雖然看來熱鬧緊張，神奇百出，但在字裏行間已跳露着沒落的凄凉和掙扎的艱難，等到孔明歸天，蜀國的壽命，也就奄奄一息了。讀小說的人看熟了的五虎將，這時都已不再現身文字中，而蜀國無大將，廖化也居然作先鋒，讀書至此，每廢然嘆息。</p>
<p>我那時倒並沒有輕薄廖化的意思，只是想，何不幸蜀國將亡，述人才都會湮沒了。</p>
<p>今日的世界，本來還像從前一樣，某甲，某乙，某丙等等，陣列整齊，某甲死了，某乙塡甲缺，某丙塡乙缺，等到某乙死了的時候，某丙後面繼任無人，某丙又未必能負大任，於是「廖化作先鋒」，也惟有這一個辦法可走了。縱然廖化自己頗能明瞭自己力不勝任，也惟有勉爲其難了。</p>
<p>這裏的關鍵，是在五虎將正當劍扳弩張的時候，不知道獎掖後繼人才，一旦靑黃不接，大勢也在這時候完結了。</p>
<p>向上爬，在中國人腦筋裏是天經地義。辛勞一世，只不過希望能够一旦爬上頂端，社會一般人到那時候，也會酬勞他過往的經歷和守株待兎的精神，自然默認他爲後繼的人選。這時，他往往頂多不過是一位像廖化那樣的人才。在中國，除了歷史的突變時期能造就幾個英豪之外，向來不知甄扳眞才的。這大概是因爲「孺子成名」，對於他們老前輩彷彿都是一種威脅的緣故。</p>
<p>畢竟在廖化充先鐸的時侯，蜀國已在最後掙扎的時期了。</p>
<p>所以從這裏應該得到一點敎訓：一個寥化誠然不能擋晉的新銳　　，就是五虎猛　又何　為　能　劉團於　　永　呢？</p>

<h3 id="c240">好萊塢黑幕重重電影演員的招考（上） <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— 馥</p>
<p>在我們這上海地方，我們巳經在報紙上時時看到靑女男女，爲了一點想進電影界的德望，而去報名投考什麼電影學校，新立公司等，以致受騙的新聞。實在，這種事是層出不窮的。亦不止我們上海有這種事，就是在電影公司林立，一般人應當比較多些知識和經騐的好萊塢，亦並不缺少這種黑幕。我們現在且將美國電影雜誌裹所讀到的一些，翻譯出來。</p>
<p>這種製造黑幕的人，用盡了機巧，佈滿了迷網，等待着一般眼光短小，經騐缺乏，而過於熱心的靑年男女，來自投羅網。我們現在特將各種內幕揭出，希望有志電影的靑年男女，看了之後，可以增些閱歷。耗費金錢，還在其次，損失光陰，或竟至流落他鄕，欲歸不得，事至慘也。</p>
<p>我們先講舞台招考的黑幕。在好萊塢和落杉磯，那裏有多少戲院。因爲那些都是大家所認作電影公司的外庫，或樣子間——電影鉅頭常常蒞臨，拔選新人才的地方——所以有許多想進影界而不得門路的男女，就想先到舞台上試試身乎，而得些初步的經騐。</p>
<p>果然，某甲一天在報紙上看到了一個小廣告：「歌舞喜劇，不日排演。招考演員，歌女，舞女等等。」他就照着報上登載的地址，尋到了那個地方。屋子裏佈景得很像樣。招待員接待殷勤，知道財神到了。那位經理先生，一看見他就滿口的說，他正是他們所尋覓的人。條件亦很優異。他們吿訴他，他們正在和一位著名的影星接洽，派他充一個重要角色。</p>
<p>第二天跑到那裹，他們又在選擇舞女了。他數了一數，那裹至少有七十五個。更巧的，竟沒有一個落選的。他且不管，先去尋到了經理。他們的談話還是十分的滿意。一回兒，經理先生出來向大家寅講，那裏大約有一百多人。他信口雌黃的說，某某大人物是財政的後盾，政府方面如何協助，因爲這是一種宣傳愛國的壯舉。練習排演，規定了兩星期之後。</p>
<p>那經理又說，請諸君在外，千萬不可提及這件事，因爲他們不贊成事先鼓吹，而想排演圓熟之後，一舉驚人的。那位投考的人，一時雖有些懷疑，究竟爲什麼要這樣嚴守秘密，但是某某大人物的名字，他是好像聽見過的，並且有政府的協助大概不至於落空的了。</p>
<p>過了許多日子，他們的戲亦快要排演了。一天，他們，一般投考錄取的靑年男女，都收到了一張明日開始排演的通知。他們都如期而到了。他們一排一排的，被請進了經理先生的公事房。那位經理愁眉苦眼的吿訴大家，那個歌舞劇巳經預定了六個禮拜之內，要在西雅圖登壇的，但是那位大人物突然的死了。他說他自己的錢，已經化得差不多了。現在還缺少一點維持費。他想將全部戲班，生財等等，盤給別人。但是，盤給別人，讓別人去賺錢——十拿九穩的錢——不如自己人承頂下來。倘使他們每人肯認十塊錢，作爲一股，那排演就可以繼續下去。到了開幕之後，他們穩穩可以賺錢，一本萬利。</p>
<p>許多人聽了他講得有理，就連忙答應了，况且十塊錢亦不多。可是一個人十塊，十個人一百塊，一百個人就是一千塊。當然，那齣戲是永遠沒有開過幕。所提到的一位影星，後來遇到了，她根本不知道這麽回事，而所謂某大人物者，或根本沒有這個人，或確有其人，但並沒有死。</p>
<p>過了一個月，那位投考對又在別一家報上，看到了一個想似的廣吿。他是過來人，多了些經騐了，却還想去試試，或者遇到實在的呢。他照舊的按址前往。尋到了。他走進了經理先生的公事房。照舊的，他們吿訴他，他正他們所需要的人，並且請他明天再來，可以將排戲的腳本給他了。</p>
<p>到了明天，他又去了。他驚奇的發現，發給脚本呌他們去研究的，不止他一個人，但是經理先生看出了他的懷疑，走過來低聲告訴他說：「你放心。他們不過裝裝面子，角色巳經派定你的了。」他並且告訴他，他們的資格都不够的。經理先生並且送了他一個脚本，呌他回去細讀，請他下禮拜再式正式排演。到了下禮拜他收到了通吿，又如期而往。可是情形不對了。</p>
<p>他到了那裏，看見屋子裹擠滿了人。他想一個戲班，决容納不了這許多人的。他心裏早就明白了，必定又是串的什麽把戲。果然，他查出來了，每一個角色倒有六個扮演的人。經理先生要發台詞了，那是打字機打就的。但是在沒有頒發之前，他宣布以前這種台詞遺失得太多了，現在他不得不收回一些印刷紙張的成本。並不多，不過每份兩塊五角錢。但是一百個人，就是二百五十塊。五天的酬報，也還不差。這就是他第二次的經騐，當然他自己並沒有受騙。　（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c241">評「生之哀歌」 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— 繼漢</p>
<p>——金城映</p>
<p>以知識份子失業作爲問題的提在觀觀衆之前，在目前失業恐慌的浪潮之下，「生之哀歌」主題的嚴肅性，確是十分値得重視的。但是有了好的內容，不能通過電影技術的表現山來，却是莫大的損失。因此它不能取得社會比較重大的反應，人們是眞摯替「生之哀歌惋情了。</p>
<p>在生之哀歌」中，劇作者十分樸素的吿訴我們，在這人浮於事的社會中，知識份子的靑年，是一天一天的被過上飢餓綫上。不過他們是有正義　的，卽　　　的孩子　死　亡的　　　也　背着良心出賣民族利益的寫一篇「共存共榮」的文章。這種靑年，在目前我們經常可以接觸着，他們有遠大的眼光，他們有熱情的正義，然而就因有太有良心了，便不爲現社會所容，於是祇好走上生活的絕路了！</p>
<p>這是一個相當現實的悲劇，至少它對於知識份子的人們，應當獲得他們的同情。但是我們祇能說劇作者有着很好的概念，並沒有將這概念形象的表現出來。不能掩飾的，劇作者對於故事沒有組織，差不多是支離破碎而片斷的陳列在觀衆之前。他所能做到的是叙述甲方，便將乙方丟掉，有時又利用偶然的機會聯結起來，全沒有嚴密的結構。胡萍，王乃東，和黎明暉，王引的兩條綫的發展，已經沒有錯綜的交織，再從黎明暉，王引，這方面又分出第三條綫的秦桐，於是更形混亂子。</p>
<p>當然，誰也不會忽視導演手法的生疏。他對於劇的調子，整個的是那樣的慢，簡直使人們有在夢境的威覺。我幾乎疑心這一影片是沒有經過剪接的。假使有一番較好的編織，未嘗不可以獲得較好的效果。少有動人的塲面，而整個的戲又是那末對觀衆「足演二小時的約言，我以爲是沒有必要的。</p>
<p>再從小的地方面來觀察導演的疏忽，如王引同一時間上一塲是黑頭髮，下一塲變爲花白頭髮了。王引的孩子臨死時，仰角鏡頭的特寫，顯得那小孩是個面團團的大人。胡萍唱娥皇女英時，那四個舞蹈着的女孩的動作，和歌的情調毫無關聯，眞是所謂活動背景！</p>
<p>總之，這裏是沒有映出與悲哀的調劑，沒有快與慢的協調。幾個演員如黎明暉，王乃東，王引，胡萍，秦桐諸人，以前都是頗有成績的，但在這裏除了個別地方若干的發揮了演員的小聰明之外，因着導演對他們沒有好的指揮與處理，都是那般的平凡。有幾塲很好看的佈景，可是沒有好的戲配合起來，那也祇顯得奢侈的浪費。至於配音，更未成熟。除了主題的現實之外，在技術方面，都使「生之哀歌」不能成爲成功的悲劇。</p>

<p>加拿大維多利城新成立之北方影片公司，近公映一辱華影片，該片各曰「黑衣」（BlackRobe），第一幕曰「華區秘密」，內容係描寫該城華人區域之華人神秘社團，私運鴉片，保奉觀世音菩薩爲神秘結合中心等等。該片於去年開始攝製，曾到華人袁某所開某古董店購買華人衣飾，並由袁某介紹，以若干不肖華人充任演員拍攝。經華僑發覺後，即由中華會館派員向當地市府交涉，請予禁止，但該片已攝製完竣，竟於今年三月開始在本城恩派亞戲院公映，我國駐在領事館聞悉後，即正式備函市府提出抗議，並向電影檢查官交涉，檢查官據函後，以該片確有辱華悄形，即呈請司法部轉令省警察前往該公司，將該片予以沒收處分，此事始吿一段落云。</p>

<p>— 緹雲</p>
<p>美國華納兄弟出品　凱茀蘭茜斯等主演</p>
<p>那是初秋的一天下午，寇蒂斯飛行塲聚集了無數的觀衆，在看著空軍的表演。忽然一隻外來的飛機，多半是一雙私有的飛機，冲天而起，在空軍的飛機隊中，橫衝直撞的飛翔著，這擾亂了空軍的陣綫，使下面看的人都相顧失色，就是軍樂隊奏樂的拍子都亂了。這時祗聽見無綫電的宣吿員在無綫電的喇叭裹報吿道：「大家都不知道怎麽回事……那隻飛機不知道從那裏來的。現在空軍的行伍都給它擾動了……亦不知道誰駕駛的……不像是軍事飛機……這事太古怪了……差不多和蘭姆賽隊長的飛機撞著……看台上都亂起來了……」</p>
<p>果然空軍的行列，被那隻怪機擾動了之後，就分散開來，陸續的飛下來了。那隻怪機，好像亦知道下面的擾動似的，亦飛了下來。那隻機停住了之後，一個靑年穿著便服，從那隻機上跳了下來。他身材高大，體格魁梧，頭髮光滑而黑，態度是漢然的。他下了地，自己拉拉自己的領帶。許多飛行敎官都擁了上去，將他團團圍了起來。其中一個說道：「少校要見你呢。你去見他去吧。」</p>
<p>那少年好像一些感覺沒有似的自言自語道：「歉得很，將我的飛機停在飛行塲的當中。」他說著就跟了一班軍官跑到少校的面前。那少校問他道：「你叫什麼名字？」那少年道：「脫雷派克」少校又問道：「你在天空之中做什麽」？脫雷派克道：「我亦是飛行飛行呀。」他那一些不知畏懼的神氣，將許多站在旁邊靜聽的一班軍官，都嚇得橋舌不下了。</p>
<p>這時少校跳了起來道：「哦，你亦飛行飛行。你知道嗎，你擾亂了今天空軍操演的陣綫？你還不快些說，到底是怎麽回事？」脫雷淡然道：「我恐怕講得太快了，不會講得好的。不過，正經的說，我的飛行雖然似乎超越了相當的範圍，但是我並沒有犯法，因爲天空之中，本來是沒有法津的。我恐怕你沒有法子將我逮捕吧。」</p>
<p>這個時候，忽然一個人奔了進來。他的名字叫華德勃立强。他是脫雷派克的朋友，聽見了這件事，特嘿來營救的。他並不一定知道脫雷犯了罪，他就知道脫雷經過了普信全無的一年半又回來了，又知道飛行塲上發現了一隻怪機，他就知道一定是脫雷派克了。華德走了進來，先不招呼盼雷，就直接的和少校說道：「我的名字呌華德勃立强，是史華道將軍很要好的朋友。派克那件事，請你交給我辦。我一定使他不至於再犯。」</p>
<p>脫雷派克聽了華德勃立强的話，眉頭聳了一聳、露了些微笑。少校說道：「當然我們這裏操演空軍，用不著他來參加的。」他說著，就把脫雷派克開釋了。盼雷於是對著華德道：「我去將飛機開過來好嗎」？華德道：「不用！我們一同出去……坐汽車……我自己開。」他們一路談著活，一大半是華德講的。他說道：我，你漫遊了十八個月，一些目的沒有，並且在文尼齊拉因為擾亂治安而被監禁了十天，兩次飛機出事，兩根肋骨跌斷，吃了一次官司，現在又來打岔空軍的　演了……」（未完）</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Arita, the Japanese Minister to China, returned home this morning on the Ryuta Maru from Shanghai to report on the Chinese situation to Foreign Minister Hirota and offer suggestions regarding the implementation of policies toward China. Furthermore, in order to pave the way for successors, he will express his intention to resign. However, Foreign Minister Hirota believes that although Sino-Japanese relations have normalized, the political and economic situation remains delicate, and there are still various difficulties in opening up relations between the two countries. Therefore, he does not want to replace the Minister to China and will persuade Minister Arita to resume his post.

<p>(Tianjin) On trains passing through Pingjin, there are always Chinese traitors and Japanese and Korean ruffians smuggling silver out of the country. Hao Gete, the Customs Commissioner of Qinhuangdao Customs, went to Yuguan on the 19th to discuss inspection methods for customs officers boarding trains with Yi Wo, the head of the Japanese special service agency. At 10 am on the 20th, Tianjin Customs Commissioner Bao Si visited Chairman Yu at the provincial government to discuss assisting in preventing the outflow of silver from Tianjin. The discussion lasted about half an hour. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Recently, there have been reports of silver being smuggled out of the country from Qinhuangdao and other places. As a result of negotiations between the Hebei Provincial Government and the Japanese, permission was only granted for inspections at Yuguan Station. Regarding the issue of on-train inspections, although the Japanese side has agreed to assist when necessary, there are still many practical difficulties. Mr. Seale, the English Customs Commissioner of Qinhuangdao Customs, visited Yi Wo again in Yuguan on the 19th of this month to negotiate. Yi Wo stated that if on-train inspections are implemented, they must be conducted jointly by China and Japan. Therefore, this matter has not been fully resolved. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The customs and silver community authorities do not believe the reports in various newspapers about large-scale silver smuggling from the north. According to officials, the reduction in silver reserves before October 15th of last year was due to the export of silver, but the export of silver was carried out through legal procedures. The silver reserves have not decreased since then. (20th Kuomin News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Xiamen) According to news from the customs, the customs has recently increased the number of personnel to combat smuggling in order to prevent silver exports. As a result, silver smuggling has been cut off, and silver export tax revenue is also minimal. This is because the banking community respects the gentlemen's agreement and does not export silver.

<h3 id="e6">Tao Shangming Visits Yin Tong to Discuss War Zone Issues; Luan Mining Strike Resolved; Funing Area Peaceful <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Tao Shangming went to Beiping from Tangshan yesterday. This morning, he visited Gu Tong to discuss war zone issues. Yin Tong said that Huang Fu's illness is gradually improving. After receiving a dozen injections to replenish blood, he will recover. He will come down the mountain to take office in Nanjing at the end of this month or the beginning of next month. In the future, he may travel between Beiping and Nanjing to handle official business. The issue of the survival of the War Zone Clearance Committee will be discussed and decided at a meeting in the next few days. Huang has no objections to this. The Xin'an Security Team will be replaced and will be under the command of the commissioner. There will be no Security Commander. He will stay in Beiping for about three or four days and then return to Tianjin. He will go to Tokyo with four or five staff members from the Beiping-Nanjing Railway Bureau to attend the Japan Ministry of Railways Tourism Conference.

<p>(Beiping) Tao Shangming said that the date for the replacement of the security team will be decided at a meeting of the War Zone Clearance Committee. There were rumors in Tangshan that the Kailuan miners would go on strike on the 18th, but the strike has been averted. Zhao Dazhong once went to Tangshan to carry out activities and a warrant was issued for his arrest, so Zhao left. After Feng Shoupeng's troops were stationed in Tangshan, the troops were strictly disciplined. The reorganization of the troops will be completed before further action is taken. There were many bandits in Funing County, but the area is still peaceful since Zhou Yuying led troops to garrison there. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>

Shen Chang said that Gu had previously suffered from insomnia, but it has been cured. He came north to rest quietly and will return to Nanjing soon. He is scheduled to return to work at the beginning of next month. Before returning to Nanjing, he will inspect various routes. The rerouting project on the Ping-Sui Railway will be completed by the end of June. One hundred new boxcars that were ordered have already been transported to the railway for use. The current situation of the railway is very good, with daily revenue of more than 30,000 yuan.

<h3 id="e36">International Currency Wars and Our Nation <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>In recent years, the great powers have used currency inflation as a method to restore prosperity, leading to an increasingly intensified international currency war. The methods of currency war are emerging endlessly and becoming increasingly strange. The more common and frequently seen methods are abandoning the gold standard, reducing the fineness of currency, and buying up gold, silver, and other countries' currencies, etc. All these methods are sufficient to cause the external exchange rate of one's own currency to fall. The purpose is to make the price of imported foreign goods expensive and difficult to sell, to prevent the outflow of funds. At the same time, it makes the price of domestic exports lower, which is conducive to sales, in order to absorb foreign funds. In essence, it is to seize overseas markets in order to alleviate the domestic economic panic and seek the restoration of prosperity.</p>
<p>The purpose of currency wars is such that, in terms of the relationship between the great powers and underdeveloped countries, the former extracts the purchasing power of the latter and undermines its nascent productivity, making it economically dependent on the former. Our country is an underdeveloped country, so our national industry suffers greatly from the scourge of this international currency war. In terms of heavy industry, our country's heavy industry is still in its infancy, and after this blow, it is not only difficult to develop, but it is also becoming increasingly bleak. In terms of light industry, our country's emerging match, cigarette, and rubber industries have all reduced working hours, and some are even unable to maintain themselves. Even the cotton spinning and silk reeling industries, which account for the majority of national capital, have recently repeatedly reduced production and stopped work, which is extremely difficult. As for the method of buying up silver in the currency war, it has caused a large outflow of silver from our country, resulting in a shortage of chips in the market, credit contraction, and financial institutions having to be extremely cautious about investing in national industries. The increase in loan interest rates further increases the cost of industrial products and makes them difficult to promote. It can be seen that all sectors of our country directly and indirectly suffer from the impact of international currency wars, which is by no means small.</p>
<p>However, national industry is the lifeline of the national economy, and the prosperity or decline of national industry is, in fact, the prosperity or decline of the entire national economy. Recognizing this, the people of the country are jointly raising funds for relief. The way to provide relief lies in the people of the country consuming domestic goods as much as possible and the financial sector providing loans to industry and commerce. Regarding the promotion of domestic goods, it is necessary for the government and the people to cooperate to be effective. What the government should pay attention to is the application of tariff policy. If the tariff rate can be increased for foreign goods that can be replaced by domestic goods, domestic manufacturers will definitely benefit a lot. Regarding exports, if active encouragement is given, such as subsidizing exporters and the shipping industry, reducing or exempting export taxes, and guiding industry and commerce to improve production technology, it may not be difficult to promote our country's international trade. As for the people, consumers should be the backing of producers to facilitate the promotion of domestic goods in the domestic market, which is also important and goes without saying. Regarding loans to industry and commerce, it is the responsibility of the financial sector. The Ministry of Finance has clearly ordered the financial sector to provide loans to relieve industry and commerce, and has determined that the targets of the loans are factories that manufacture domestic goods, stores that sell domestic goods, and those who transport domestic goods for export. The government is already working on encouraging exports and providing loans to industry and commerce. Therefore, if the people of the country can consume domestic goods as much as possible in the future, and the government can further use tariff policy to restrict imports, the adverse effects of the international currency war suffered by our country can be gradually reduced.</p>

<p>(Berlin) The German government has recently sent written notes to the governments of all countries attending the Council of the League of Nations, protesting against the resolution passed by the Council on April 17 opposing Germany's breach of contract and rearmament. (20th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Germany's protest against the League of Nations resolution was submitted to the Foreign Office at 12:55 today, and was simultaneously submitted to the fourteen countries of the Council of the League of Nations. The wording is vastly different from what was predicted by the outside world. Government officials say that this is "not a bomb, but a firecracker." The content of the note is only a straightforward protest against the League of Nations resolution. Although the wording is strong, it is restrained and leaves room for further detailed notes in the future. This note is not directed specifically at Britain or any other country, but only attacks the resolution of the Council of the League of Nations, and does not specify any one country that is solely responsible. This note was published in Berlin at 6:00 PM. Earlier, German government officials stated that the protest had been submitted to the major countries of Western Europe. After the German note was submitted, there was a widespread and unconfirmed rumor that Hitler would invite the French Foreign Minister to visit Berlin in the near future. According to a dispatch from Rome, the German Ambassador Von Hassell personally submitted the German government's protest to the Italian Foreign Ministry. (20th National Dispatch)</p>

Germany does not recognize it as a legitimate action and will therefore find it difficult to recognize it. As for the various issues mentioned in the Council's resolution, Germany will soon announce its views. (20th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Today is the forty-sixth birthday of Head of State Hitler. A military parade was held, and Propaganda Minister Goebbels delivered a speech praising Hitler. The speech was broadcast by radio and could be heard in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The speech mentioned the purge movement of June 30 last year, saying that "the Head of State had to wash away betrayal and disobedience in bloodshed." Goebbels also recited Hitler's words, saying that his work ability, knowledge, and simplicity in dealing with people are beyond the reach of ordinary people. (20th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today is the forty-sixth birthday of Head of State Hitler, and the whole country is celebrating.

<p>(Berlin) Tomorrow is Head of State Hitler's forty-sixth birthday. Tonight, it was learned that Hitler's attitude towards the European situation has become more moderate. It is heard that Hitler is currently drafting a reply to the League of Nations document with his confidants, and the content will not hinder future peace talks. The news of the last two days is vastly different. Yesterday, it was rumored that Hitler was drafting a simple and surprising statement, which caused anxiety among European countries. It was also heard that Germany's reply would be published on Hitler's birthday, detailing Germany's position, and there might be some complaints about the League of Nations' punitive measures. It was also heard that Germany had recently informally raised some questions to France and Italy at the League of Nations meeting in preparation for discussion at the Danube River Conference next month. Observers say that this proves that Germany is now willing to participate in future negotiations to maintain peace. (20th National Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e39">French-Russian Negotiations Stalled, Litvinov's Trip to Paris Cancelled <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov recently left here by car with several subordinates, destination unknown. (19th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov was originally scheduled to come here today to continue consultations with the French authorities on the mutual assistance treaty. However, due to important public affairs, he returned directly to his country, so the trip to Paris has been cancelled. The mutual assistance treaty is currently being negotiated by Foreign Minister Laval and Soviet Ambassador Potemkin. Once completed, Laval and Potemkin will hold a preliminary signing in Paris, and Laval will formally sign it in Moscow when he goes to Russia at the beginning of next month. According to the basic points of the mutual assistance treaty, France and Russia have already agreed. What is currently being negotiated is a form acceptable to both parties, striving to be clear in its wording and without ambiguity. (19th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov originally intended to come to Paris from Geneva, but suddenly cancelled his trip and returned to Moscow, causing a setback in the French-Russian mutual assistance agreement. The newspapers here believe that this setback is not permanent. The general opinion is that the reason why France and Russia have been slow to reach a compromise is that France wants to establish the agreement within the framework of the League of Nations and not hinder France's obligations under the Locarno Treaty. However, the Soviet government wants the mutual assistance agreement to be automatic. It is believed that the differences between the two sides can be resolved. Foreign Minister Laval will be able to sign the agreement when he goes to Russia at the beginning of next month. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The newspapers have interpreted Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov's direct return to Moscow from Geneva as meaning that the French-Russian mutual assistance pact has not yet been finalized. France is not happy with the mechanical and absolute application of the mutual assistance system, and wants to create clear provisions within the scope of the League of Nations Covenant, which is not satisfactory to Soviet Russia. However, the signing of the mutual assistance pact is imminent, which is what all newspapers expect. Le Petit Parisien said, "Because France is bound by the Locarno Treaty, the obligations that can be accepted regarding the mutual assistance pact are ultimately based on the Locarno Treaty. Soviet Russia wants to establish a mutual assistance system that is more free to operate outside the scope of the League of Nations Covenant and the Locarno Treaty. The two sides are currently actively negotiating on this issue." L'Écho de Paris said, "We believe that the French government will ultimately abandon the amendment. Otherwise, the countries of the Little Entente, Turkey, and Greece will be alienated from France, and even the rapprochement between Italy and France and the Danube River Pact will be affected, because these countries all want the French-Russian mutual assistance pact to be established in advance before they agree to sign the Danube River Pact." L'Avenir said that Russia will not concede, but the future of the mutual assistance pact is still optimistic. "In theory, France will have to concede, and the pact will be initialed in Paris, and then formally signed when Foreign Minister Laval visits Russia in early May." Le Nouveau Siècle said, "The French-Russian mutual assistance pact must be signed before May 1. This is good for France and a blessing for peace." The Communist Party organ L'Humanité and the right-wing Le Jour said that the difficulties in the French-Russian negotiations are due to the problem of communist propaganda within France. (20th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) French and Russian diplomats and military officials today buried themselves in the details of the French-Russian security pact for several hours. It is heard that French Foreign Minister Laval and Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov will hold a preliminary signing tomorrow. This treaty is based on Articles 15, 16, and 17 of the League of Nations Covenant, stipulating that the first step is economic and financial sanctions, and the second step is military sanctions, to punish aggressor countries. Observers say that the reason why France and Russia are so eager to complete this agreement is to strike first before Hitler replies to the League of Nations. Hitler and his confidants are drafting a reply in Munich. Laval attended a cabinet meeting today and reported on the results of the Stresa and League of Nations meetings. It is heard that the cabinet highly praised Laval for his victory. (20th National Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) Lord Privy Seal Eden, because the Liberal Party group in his constituency opposes the government's published White Paper on National Defense, will issue a statement today to defend it, stating that "Given the current world situation, if we were to unilaterally reduce armaments, Britain's prestige in maintaining peace would be greatly weakened. The government has no doubt about this. As for British foreign policy, it should continue to be based on the spirit of international cooperation. Britain has always been willing to do its part for collective security. Although Britain's defense spending has increased, it is absolutely limited to what the environment requires. The government's attitude towards the League of Nations has not changed, because this is the unchanging basis of British diplomacy. In addition, Britain should still seek to create a balance of power in Europe, and advocate that Germany should return to the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference. Although the current situation is very disappointing, "all peace-loving people should assist the government and work together to save it. Most countries now regard preventive measures as beneficial to peace and not threatening in any way. If Britain does not take these preventive measures, the government cannot bear this important responsibility." (20th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Vienna) Austrian Deputy Chancellor Starhemberg, after a brief meeting with Italian Premier Mussolini today, declared that he will request at the Rome Conference to be held next month that the Austrian army be increased to 80,000 men. Currently, Austria's military strength is limited by the Treaty of Saint-Germain to only 30,000 men, all of whom are long-term soldiers. It is rumored that Austria is specifically requesting to restore its armaments. Britain, France, and Italy have indicated that they will recognize Austria's implementation of conscription and a doubling of the number of troops in the army. Now, the claim of implementing conscription has been denied. (20th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to a dispatch from Rome in Le Matin, Austrian Deputy Chancellor Prince Starhemberg discussed the Danube River Conference and the issue of Austria's restoration of armaments with Premier Mussolini. Starhemberg, in his capacity as the leader of a paramilitary organization, presented Mussolini with a detailed plan, suggesting that Austria gradually increase its troops, rather than implementing conscription, to avoid undesirable elements from mixing into the army. Therefore, he advocated gradually establishing a new army through a volunteer system. (20th National Dispatch)</p>

However, in the recent period, German-Polish friendship has been severely tested, such as the Danzig vote, the statements by Göring, Goebbels, and Hess, and the execution of barbaric death sentences on Poles, etc. All of this has angered Poland and caused a bad impression. The disputes between these "friends" are becoming increasingly serious. Polish newspapers have long articles reporting on the recent arrest of civilians in Danzig and the news of German atrocities against Poles. At the same time, the German Defense Force held a review on the German-Polish border. All of this is a shadow over German-Polish friendship." (19th TASS Dispatch)</p>

Secretary of State Hull declared that the US Ambassador to Germany, Dodd, has submitted a note to the German Foreign Ministry, urging the German Foreign Minister to pay attention to the interest on the debt owed to the US. $2 million was due on April 15, and Germany has not paid this amount to the US, only saying that it will pay this amount in marks. This mark can only be used to buy German goods, and the loss is quite large when this mark is converted into foreign currency. Ambassador Dodd's protest stated that Germany's move is discriminatory against US bondholders.

<p>(Sofia) The King of Bulgaria has appointed former diplomat Toshev as Prime Minister. The King consulted with leaders of various political parties and key military personnel before issuing this appointment today. It is believed that the temporary implementation of military rule was discussed. This political crisis was triggered by the arrest of two former Prime Ministers and several famous politicians in the country. The release of these two is currently being considered, and strict precautions are being taken to prevent riots. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Sofia) The military cabinet members of the former cabinet held a long meeting today, and then went to see King Boris, but the King did not order them to form a cabinet, but instead appointed the famous political commentator Toshev, who had served in the diplomatic field, to try to form a new cabinet. It is generally believed that the King does not want the new cabinet to have a purely military cabinet form due to diplomatic relations. Generally speaking, the important cabinet members of the Toshev cabinet will be (1) Foreign Minister Koseivanov, (2) Finance Minister Ganazhinsky, (3) Justice Minister Digov, (4) Army Minister General Shiradov. Shiradov is the former Prime Minister of the former cabinet. Including him, there are three senior military officers in the new cabinet. As for Digov, he was originally the Minister of Justice of the former cabinet. The cabinet crisis was caused by his resignation and the resignation of two other cabinet members. (19th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Sofia) Although the famous political commentator Toshev has been ordered to form a cabinet, he has encountered some difficulties. The former Minister of Justice, Digov, requested that the former Prime Minister Zangov be released immediately as a condition for joining the cabinet. The former Prime Minister, General Shiradov, originally planned to be transferred to the position of Army Minister, but now he will not join the new cabinet. The position of Army Minister will therefore be taken by General Radev. However, after the formation of the new cabinet, regardless of the personnel, it will be approved by King Boris. It is generally believed that the choice of the new Prime Minister in this cabinet reshuffle is entirely from the will of the King and has not been subject to any restrictions, which is in line with the spirit of the constitution. Some quarters also believe that the new government is the first step towards restoring parliamentary politics. The military will definitely express its approval. (20th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) After the 1935-36 budget increased the import duty on soybeans imported from the three northeastern provinces of China, the Financial News criticized it sharply, stating: "Soybeans have a wide range of uses, such as for making bread, refining artificial butter, making soy sauce, and feeding livestock. There are more than a hundred uses in total. Britain does not produce this item. Although there are some places engaged in planting, the quantity is extremely small unless the government subsidizes it. As for the various parts of the empire, they also do not produce this item. The large source of supply is from one corner of the three northeastern provinces. The only justifiable reason for the government's increase in import duty is that soybeans can compete with certain kinds of vegetable oils produced by the empire. It is known that the three northeastern provinces do not export much soybean oil and soybean cake. In short, the government's move is to exclude raw materials from other countries and encourage the other raw materials produced by the empire to replace them. This is something that Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain cannot frankly admit." (20th Havas dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e109">Zhang Ji Returns to Peiping from Shaanxi; Plans to Raise Funds to Repair the Yellow Emperor's Mausoleum; Tobacco Suppression in Shaanxi Yields Good Results <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Peiping Correspondence: Zhang Ji, Central Committee Member of the Kuomintang and Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Capital Construction of Xi'an, arrived in Peiping on the evening of the 17th from Xi'an after visiting the Yellow Emperor's Mausoleum. This reporter visited him on the morning of the 18th to inquire about the National Tomb Sweeping Day and the recent situation in Shaanxi Province. The following is a record of Zhang's remarks: "Since the beginning of spring in Shaanxi Province, rainfall has been timely and abundant, with a total of ten thorough rainfalls. The wheat seedlings are lush and thriving, and a bumper harvest is expected this autumn. The Central Government's National Tomb Sweeping Day, commemorating the Mausoleums of the Zhou Dynasty, Mao Mausoleum, and the Yellow Emperor's Mausoleum, aims to awaken the public, remember our Han ancestors, and promote our national spirit. Xi'an is about four hundred li from the Yellow Emperor's Mausoleum. A direct automobile road has been built and traffic will be convenient for next spring's Tomb Sweeping Day, and more people will participate. The Yellow Emperor Temple is located on a high mountain, about 1,200 to 3,000 meters above sea level. The temple has suffered considerable damage because of its age and lack of protection. We have begun to raise funds for repairs. The cypress forest near the Yellow Emperor's Mausoleum is vast and magnificent. The cypresses are relics from two thousand years ago, and those who enter the area feel the hardship of our ancestors' pioneering efforts. The area near the Yellow Emperor's Mausoleum is rich in resources, such as wool and coal mines. However, the 23 counties surrounding the Yellow Emperor's Mausoleum have a population of about one million. The area is vast and sparsely populated, and goods are left unused because of a lack of development. Also, inconvenience of transportation has left the nation paying little attention to this. The authorities believe that it is necessary to actively promote development. The decided steps include local development and immigration. With a little time, these will become reality. As a result of the Shaanxi Provincial Highway Economic Committee's efforts, approximately 2,000 li of roads have been completed. The Xi'an to Lanzhou section will be open to traffic on May 1st. The Xi'an to Hanzhong section, over 1,000 li long, will also be completed soon. The rampant banditry in northern Shaanxi was purely due to the sparse population, allowing bandits to gather easily. Furthermore, the terrain is dangerous, which the bandits use as a stronghold. The people have no ability to defend or resist, causing the bandit forces to grow. Since the arrival of the North China Military Council's staff to Shaanxi to supervise the suppression of bandits, there have been outstanding results. Xu Xiangqian's remaining bandit troops have fled back to Sichuan. The remaining bandits have become feeble, and their elimination is foreseeable. The Shaanxi Provincial Government's tobacco suppression plan has yielded satisfactory results after the first phase of implementation. Farmers in the tobacco-prohibited areas who switched to growing cotton last year had a harvest of about 30 million yuan. Therefore, farmers in other tobacco-growing areas have heard the news and are switching to cotton this year, as it is more profitable than growing tobacco. Therefore, they are following good advice. In terms of the current situation, not only can tobacco seedlings be completely eliminated as scheduled, but the rural economy of Shaanxi Province can also be revitalized and become better. The purpose of building a secondary capital is twofold: (1) to showcase historical sites, and at the same time, local construction will progress with the establishment of the secondary capital, making Xi'an a great tourist area. Its future prosperity can be imagined. (2) Xi'an was the ancient capital of emperors and is of great importance. The construction of the secondary capital is closely related to the development of the Northwest. The people should work together to achieve this goal," and so on. It is heard that Zhang will stay in Peiping for a few days before leaving for the capital. (18th)</p>
<h3 id="e110">The Tragic Situation in Lihuang County, Anhui Province - Parents Starved to Death, Their Son Cut and Cooked Their Flesh <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: The Anhui Provincial Government recently approved a letter from Liang Guanying, Commander-in-Chief of the Twenty-fifth Route Army, which stated that, according to investigations conducted in the front lines, several months ago, a disaster victim near Dingjiabu was cut and eaten by his son. The tragic situation is unbearable to read, and the address and name are very accurate and not false. Attached is the original report, asking for review. It is noted that three batches of relief grain have been allocated to Lihuang County, totaling 2,800 shi, plus 800 shi of work-relief grain. However, the disaster in the county is severe, and it is only a drop in the bucket, making it difficult to provide relief. A special letter has been sent to the Provincial Disaster Relief Committee for verification and swift relief to save the remaining survivors. The following is the original report, issued in Dingjiabu on March 17: (1) On the afternoon of the 15th of this month, I went to Pengjiawan near Dingjiabu to investigate. I heard a refugee, Zhang Zhangshi, say that there was a Wang Zhangshi (41 years old), a refugee from Zengjiagui, Tangchong. Her husband, named Wudao, had died long ago, and she and her two sons begged for food to survive. They traveled to Liaojia Wawu in Nanxi and temporarily stayed there. In mid-January, when it snowed heavily, they were unable to beg for food. The woman starved to death there. Her two sons, the elder named Wang Dingzhi (12 years old) and the younger Wang Xiaoer (9 years old), had not eaten a grain of rice for several days and were starving and freezing. They became mentally deranged and cut off their mother's leg with a knife, cooked it, and ate it. Zhang Zhangshi claimed that the Wang Zhangshi who was eaten was her sister. She went to see her sister after hearing of her death and personally saw her two nephews cutting the flesh. After hearing this, I was filled with pity. I inquired about the whereabouts of the two sons. They had gone far away to beg for food and were nowhere to be found. (2) On the morning of the 16th of this month, I went to Pengjiawan again and saw Wu Zicheng, who is from Gongjiawan, Zimu River. He had been a soldier under Tian Zijin in the Laomaodong Defense Corps. He said that last year, in October, he saw Wen Yuanyou (40 years old), who had two sons and was from Caijiawan near Maiyuan in the fifth district. Because of the widespread famine, they had no way to beg for food and starved to death. His two sons, the elder named Wen Yousheng (12 years old) and the younger Wen Hesheng (8 years old), were young and starving and cut the flesh off their father's corpse with a kitchen knife and cooked it on the fire. I (Wu Zicheng himself) and the soldiers in the same team had all seen it when we went out on patrol. Later, I heard that both sons had also starved to death. Report by Yue Weigao (March 18).</p>
<h3 id="e111">Guangdong Province's Commercial Control; Rubber and Match Industries Implement Control One After Another; Department of Finance Revises Commercial Control Regulations <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Commerce in Guangdong Province has declined in recent years, and the number of store closures has increased. According to a survey in March of this year, in Guangzhou alone, a total of 39 businesses closed. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, seeking a temporary solution, proposed a trade control plan. With the rise of this proposal, merchants who have suffered from competition have occasionally supported it. For example, the Rubber Industry Association recently requested official approval to implement a rubber industry control plan, first by limiting production and then by leveling prices and material standards. A limited council was established to take charge of the matter, with one representative from each factory serving as a director. It was established yesterday. Next, the match industry recently implemented control, stipulating that from April 1 of this year, the Business Tax Bureau will stop issuing new business licenses for match factories. The suspension will last until December 1938. During this period, only match factories that have already registered will be allowed to operate. Those who apply for new business licenses will be prohibited. Other industries that have followed suit and requested control include the hotel and shipping industries. After receiving the reports, the Department of Construction scheduled a meeting on the 15th of this month, gathering shipping representatives to discuss shipping control measures. The measures were drafted by shipping companies, discussed, and then submitted to the Department of Construction for review. The hotel industry, like the rubber and match industries, is now requesting control measures. The number of new hotels is increasing every year, leading to oversupply. Currently, some hotels are reducing room rates by 60% to 50% in order to attract customers, but it is difficult to maintain operations. They have requested the Department of Construction to implement control measures, similar to those in the rubber and match industries, by first limiting new establishments and then standardizing room rates for the entire industry in order to save the business.</p>
<p>As for the commercial control regulations proposed by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce some time ago, they were submitted to the Department of Finance, which dispatched eight specialists to review the commercial control proposal and approved it with revisions. The commercial control regulations are attached below: (Article 1) The Guangdong Provincial Government, in order to revitalize the province's industry and develop the economy, will reorganize and control the province's (city's) chambers of commerce and all commercial firms. (Article 2) The chamber of commerce is subordinate to all commercial firms within the province (city). (Article 3) Each commercial firm will be a unit for selling one or several common commodities.

<p>The first phase of the river dredging project for the city river, from Dongmenkou to Guangming Bridge, was completed on the 20th of last month. The project was reported to the county government to await inspection and acceptance by the Department of Construction. After numerous telegrams and letters, Gu Houxi, a technician from the department, came to Songjiang to inspect the project. Xu Mojia, the head of the county government's technology section, accompanied him. The points of inspection were presented to the department for approval. Approval to open the dams has been received. After receiving the order, the county government instructed Wang Yunshi, the director of the section, to convene the dam workers and open the dams today (20th) under the supervision of Yang Lufu, a technical staff member of the county committee. However, the Guangming Bridge dam is temporarily retained because it is used for the second phase of river dredging.</p>

<p>Regarding the case of the Tianmashan Public Security Seventh Substation being destroyed by workers from Jiangbei a few days ago, Director He sent Yang Shijie, the leader of the detective team, and a special task force to the countryside to investigate. It is now known that the substation was destroyed by a riot of stone quarrying workers from Chenshan, because new teahouses were opened in Chenshan Town, where stone quarrying workers gathered to gamble. Officer Xu received a report, ordered the police to arrest ten gamblers, and fined each of them. The workers, relying on their numbers, held a grudge and incited a riot, causing injury to Zhou, and the damage to the items in the substation was minor. Afterwards, team leader Yang arrested the two main culprits, who were temporarily bailed out by the stone quarrying foremen to await summons. Team leader Yang reported the situation to the review and seized control.</p>

They also requested the establishment of a Business Tax Evaluation Committee. The County Chamber of Commerce decided to submit the above two matters to the joint meeting of the supervisory committee of the Provincial Chamber of Commerce today (21st) for discussion.</p>

<p>In this county, stamp duties were usually collected by the Stamp Bureau. Now, the bureau has been abolished, and the county government is handling the duties. Because county government officials are imposing excessively harsh penalties, the merchants have requested the County Chamber of Commerce to make an appeal for lenient treatment in order to alleviate their difficulties. The general idea of the appeal is that the Stamp Tax Bureau used to form an adjudication committee with the Chamber of Commerce and the Public Security Bureau to handle cases of failure to affix stamps. The committee usually dealt with these cases leniently, ordering the purchase of some stamp tickets. The merchants' failure to affix stamps was usually due to temporary negligence and not comparable to intentional tax evasion for petty gain. Now, commerce is declining day by day. Since stamp duties are now handled by the county government, in terms of law, the business community is accustomed to the previous practice and is mostly unaware of the severity of the penalties for failure to follow the regulations. In terms of business conditions, occasional negligence is forgivable. All industries are withering away, and it seems that extra leniency should be given to merchants who occasionally fail to affix stamps. This would show generosity and alleviate the hardships of the merchants.</p>
<p>Special Report</p>
<h3 id="e121">Investigation into the Auxiliary Currency of Gansu <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Jingzhou</p>
<p>(I) Overview</p>
<p>Gansu Province, with its inconvenient transportation and stagnant financial situation, only circulated silver taels and copper coins during the late Qing Dynasty. Silver coins and copper coins were not in circulation. In the third year of the Republic of China (1914), Zhang Guangjian was ordered to govern Gansu, and he brought a large amount of copper coins. From then on, Gansu Province had the name of copper coins. This article, although titled "Auxiliary Currency," only focuses on copper coins. Initially, they only circulated in the provincial capital, and only those worth ten cash were used. Each national currency yuan could be exchanged for about one hundred copper coins (that is, about one thousand cash). This maintained the decimal price. However, this also led to the increasing influx of foreign copper coins. In the ninth year of the Republic of China (1920), Lu Hongtao succeeded as the governor of Gansu. At that time, the Gansu Official Bank was experiencing a run. Lu Hongtao, in order to relieve the market and cope with the military expenses, initiated the casting of copper coins. Unfortunately, he entrusted the task to the wrong people. The copper quality was inferior, and the casting method was extremely crude. People at the time called them "sand-mold copper coins." Although the government tried to promote them by force, the high price of copper coins and the exclusive casting of those worth ten cash proved unprofitable. So they changed to casting those worth twenty cash, in order to gain more profit. Cunning people, envious of the lucrative profits and the ease of imitating the model, set up private furnaces for private minting, resulting in a sharp drop in prices. The Lanzhou market became a world of sand-mold copper coins. Not only were good coins driven out completely, but all the copper coins in the counties were also melted down. At that time, the financial situation was chaotic, everything was expensive, agriculture and commerce were in distress, and complaints arose everywhere. Lu Hongtao deeply regretted his past mistakes. He began to collect all the sand-mold copper coins in the market at the rate of twenty strings per tael of silver and destroy them. At the same time, he purchased several small printing machines from Tianjin, re-refined the collected sand-mold coins, and re-cast them into copper coins worth ten cash, until the sand-mold copper coins were completely collected. At the same time, Kong Fanjin, the garrison commander of Longnan, also purchased large-scale machinery from Tianjin and Shanghai, and set up a factory to cast them at Quan'shui. Because there was no profit to be made from copper coins worth ten cash, he imitated the Sichuan currency format and cast those worth fifty, one hundred, and two hundred cash. Some were even worth dozens or hundreds of strings of cash, collectively called "big plates." The people of Longnan, under the pressure of accumulated power, had no way to resist and had to endure the promotion of these coins. By the fourteenth year of the Republic of China (1925), when the National Revolutionary Army entered Gansu, Kong Fanjin was forced to leave Qin, and the poison of these "big plate" copper coins had spread throughout the counties of Longnan. After Kong left, the National Revolutionary Army transported all the machinery to the provincial capital (the machinery of the current mint). They once tried to cast copper coins worth one hundred cash, intending to promote them in the provincial capital, but were stopped by the Chamber of Commerce. However, the area of circulation of the "big plate" copper coins has since become wider, from Longnan to Longdong, and to Lintao, Dingxi, Yuzhong, and other counties, almost without exception. This was because of the bankruptcy of the rural areas and the depletion of finances, leaving no other means of circulation. In the twenty-first year of the Republic of China (1932), the provincial mint also handed over more than 200,000 catties of copper coins to the Ping City Official Money Bureau for distribution, along with old "big plate" copper coins. At the same time, Bu Yunxiang of Xijin Nanhang also transported a large amount of copper coins and handed them over to the mint to be re-cast into "man-plate" copper coins and transported to the Hezhou area for promotion, causing prices to skyrocket and the people's livelihood to deteriorate. Later, with the approval of the Provincial Finance Department, all casting was stopped. The 66,500 "one hundred cash" copper coins that had already been cast were sold by the Ping City Bureau in Hezhou, Jingning, Huining, and other places. This is a general overview of the casting of copper coins in Gansu Province. In the past two years, although Gansu Province has long stopped casting, it is easier for copper coins worth one hundred and five hundred from nearby Sichuan to flow into the Longnan area. Efforts are currently being made to prohibit them. However, if Kong had not started it, these inferior coins might not have been so easy to invade. Tracing the source of the disaster, I cannot but hold Kong responsible.</p>
<p>(II) Summary of the Investigation</p>
<p>When Jingzhou first took office, he considered the relationship between auxiliary currency and the people's livelihood to be extremely close. He urgently wanted to find a way to rectify the situation, in order to gradually bring it into order. Therefore, in September of the twenty-third year of the Republic of China (1934), he created a form and ordered all counties to investigate and report on the circulation of copper coins in their local areas, so as to understand the truth and serve as a preliminary step for rectification. The main items listed in the survey form are as follows: (1) What is the total number of large copper coins (such as those worth twenty, fifty, one hundred, etc.) circulating in the county market? What is the exchange rate for silver dollars? (For example, how many ten-cash, twenty-cash, fifty-cash, and one-hundred-cash copper coins can be exchanged for one silver dollar?) (2) Where do these large copper coins come from? If prohibited, would there be any impact on the market? (3) What is the impact of the circulation of these large copper coins on the livelihood of the general poor? (4) In addition to the above-mentioned copper coins, what other currencies are most popular in the market? Do other merchants and money shops issue similar promissory notes for circulation? What are the quantities? What are the exchange rates? All of the above items were divided and ordered to each county to investigate and report truthfully, and they were also asked to express their opinions on the rectification, for reference. Currently, sixty-two counties have responded to the hall. The main points of the investigation are summarized below.</p>
<p>(A) Types of Copper Coins Circulating in Various Counties</p>
<p>According to the investigation reports, the types of copper coins circulating in the counties can be divided into five types: those worth ten, twenty, fifty, one hundred, and two hundred cash. Among them, the ones that occupy the widest area are the ten-cash and one-hundred-cash copper coins, which circulate in thirty-four counties.

<h3 id="e123">Revitalizing the Rural Areas; Spring Plowing Movement Begins; Social Affairs Bureau Issues a Letter to Farmers <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>According to Dagongshe, the spring plowing movement prepared by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Party Department, the Municipal Farmers' Association, and the Agricultural Experiment Field began yesterday. Farmers' associations in various districts jointly mobilized for publicity, and the Social Affairs Bureau issued a letter to farmers throughout the city, sincerely aiming to revitalize the rural areas. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Letter from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to Farmers</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau issued a letter to farmers throughout the city yesterday, stating: "Farmers, in recent years, China's rural areas seem to have been plagued by misfortune. Whether it is natural disasters or man-made calamities, they have continuously made farmers poorer and more declining. A few years ago, the various needs of life could still be勉强managed, and there was no worry or anxiety, but now it is different, and there are often worries about 'no clothes to wear,' 'no food to eat,' and 'no place to live.' On the surface, this is a common problem that everyone feels, but the fundamental problem lies in the backwardness of agriculture itself, without new knowledge to prevent disasters and increase production skills. Because of the gradual decline of production, it has affected the bankruptcy of the rural economy, coupled with the heavy exploitation of international capitalism, which has made farmers' lives even more difficult. This is really a serious and terrible thing, not only making the vast rural areas collapse and decline, but even making the entire Chinese nation unable to revive and become strong. However, if we want to revitalize the rural areas, relieve the suffering of farmers, and improve the lives of farmers, it is not a difficult problem. Because the 20th century is the century of science, all undertakings must tend to be rational and scientific. New agriculture has made amazing progress. They use group organization, scientific methods, select seeds, eliminate diseases and insects, harvest agricultural products, irrigate and fertilize, improve cultivation, and even use airplanes to sow seeds and spread insecticide powder, so that the yield of crops is gradually increased, and the lives of farmers are gradually improved, becoming rich and strong countries in the world today. If we want to make our agriculture progress and improve the lives of farmers, we naturally have to use scientific methods, because human strength cannot compete with machinery, and if we want to use scientific methods, we must seek all kinds of new agricultural knowledge to improve the quality of production and increase the quantity of production, so that we can break the current difficult situation of farmers and develop into a realm of peaceful and happy life, prosperous fields and gardens. People, land, and sovereignty are the main elements that make up our country. In China, farmers account for the largest number of people. If every member can make their agriculture progress, and every member can make their lives comfortable, in other words, every member can 'govern themselves and govern others,' 'support themselves and support others,' and 'defend themselves and defend the country,' then it is enhancing a kind of prosperity of the country. The plan for the year lies in spring. Spring is the prelude to the beginning of agricultural cultivation, so now we want to hold a 'spring plowing movement,' which is based on this important meaning to engage in. During the 'spring plowing movement,' we use the method of touring lectures to deeply enter the various rural areas of this city to provide a detailed introduction to various issues that are closely related to farmers, such as seed selection, pest control, crop cultivation, agricultural tool improvement, animal husbandry and feeding, sideline promotion, water conservancy dredging, cooperative promotion, etc., so that farmers can gain an increase in new agricultural knowledge and an improvement in production technology. Therefore, we want to invite our dear farmers to actively participate in this movement. We hope that farmers will work hard to build a new agricultural country."</p>
<p>Farmers' Associations in Various Districts Jointly Mobilize</p>
<p>The Municipal Farmers' Association has already started the spring plowing movement sponsored by the Social Affairs Bureau, and has issued instructions to the Wusong, Jiangwan, Yinxiang, Yinhang, Zhabei, Pengxiao, Zhenru, Pusong, Caojing, Fahua, Hunan, Yangsi, Tangqiao, Yangjing, Lixing, Gaohang, and Gaoqiao branches and offices in the city to organize spring plowing movement touring lecture teams, set off for lectures, designate the executive secretary of each branch as the team leader, lead farmers, and implement general mobilization. At the same time, the Municipal Farmers' Association takes advantage of the spring plowing movement to carry out large-scale literacy publicity in order to enlighten farmers' knowledge. Executive Secretary Yu Zhenhui will set off to guide the various districts today.</p>
<p>Opening Film Screenings; Free Rice Milling</p>
<p>The Spring Plowing Movement Preparatory Committee, in order to instill in farmers the experience and knowledge of various improvement technologies and knowledge such as sowing, seed selection, and pest control, has specially selected several agricultural films from the Central Propaganda Committee and the China Film Association to be screened in various districts. In addition, the Shanghai Machine Factory will use several water pumping boats with new-style domestic rice milling machines installed, and will go to various districts to perform on-site demonstrations and provide free rice milling for farmers.</p>
<p>Engaging Experts to Deliver Lectures</p>
<p>This spring plowing movement is the first time it has been held in the city, so it is expanding publicity and touring lectures. In addition to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Party Department, the Municipal Farmers' Association, and the Agricultural Experiment Field, and other four agencies, together with the farmers' sub-associations in various districts and the municipal committee members in each district, serving as lecturers, they have also sent letters to engage more than ten agricultural experts to take turns to give special academic lectures, and compiled and printed publications, leaflets, slogans, etc., which are distributed to farmers to be posted for browsing at any time.</p>
<p>Slogans and Catchphrases for the Spring Plowing Movement</p>
<p>(1) To revitalize the rural areas, we should start with improving agricultural affairs first; (2) To improve agricultural affairs, we must first increase farmers' knowledge; (3) To have a good harvest, we must pay attention to seed selection, pest control, and improved cultivation methods; (4) The spring plowing movement is a movement to instill knowledge in farmers; (5) Grouping the lives of farmers and scientizing agricultural technology; (6) Promoting sideline occupations and promoting cooperation are sufficient to regulate the rural economy; (7) Dredging rivers to facilitate irrigation and building roads to facilitate transportation; (8) The purpose of the spring plowing movement is to revitalize the rural areas; (9) Farmers, come and listen to the lectures of the spring plowing movement; (10) Farmers, let's all get up and organize a new rural area.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Three Banks Confer on Detailed Measures for Relieving Industry and Commerce Loans; After Formulating, Formally Convene a Committee; The Purpose of Loans Focuses on Production <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, together with the Bankers' Association, have been ordered by the Ministry of Finance to launch a 20 million yuan relief loan for industry and commerce. In recent days, the general managers of the business bureaus of the three banks, Xi Demao, Bei Songsun, and Zhang Peishen, have been conferring on detailed measures, which will be formulated within days, and a committee will be formally convened, and the Bankers' Association will be notified to send representatives to participate. When the relief loans are handled, the committee will preside over them. In addition to the one or two people from each of the three banks, the committee will be composed of two or three people dispatched by the Bankers' Association. Within the committee, investigation and other small groups will be set up. The purpose of this loan is to relieve the economic decline and financial depletion of our country, and relief must be started in the area of production. Loaning to factories is indirectly to revive society, so the loan procedures are very solemn. In addition to investigating its content, the technical aspects of its production must also be guided and improved. The committee will set up investigative organizations for factory content, production conditions, and product sales for factual needs, and designate the borrowing banks to be responsible for them. When necessary, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and local associations will be asked to assist.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Cadre Training Class of the Municipal Defense Association Holds Live Firing Exercise, Today and Tomorrow at the West Fort, Graduation Ceremony to Be Held in the Middle of Next Month <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The cadre training class of the Municipal Defense Association has begun training and will hold a graduation ceremony in the middle of next month. Live firing exercises will be held today (the 21st) and tomorrow at the Longhua West Fort. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Scheduled Graduation</p>
<p>In order to improve the education of various teams and cultivate cadre talents, the Defense Association specially requested and obtained approval from the Municipal Government to establish a cadre training class. Over 300 students were recommended by various teams throughout the city, and training began on November 3rd of last year. It has been five months since then. It was originally scheduled to graduate after seventeen weeks, a total of four months. However, due to holidays and absences due to cloudy weather, supplementary lessons were needed, so it was decided to postpone the graduation ceremony to the middle of next month.</p>
<p>Live Firing Exercise</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Wu Chuiying of the association told reporters that the cadre training class is approaching the end of its term, and all the academic courses have been taught in sequence. In order to test whether the students' academic performance is excellent, they specially requested and obtained approval from the Municipal Government, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, and the Municipal Security Office to hold live firing exercises at the Longhua West Fort today and tomorrow.</p>
<p>Request for Awards</p>
<p>The association believes that the students in the training class are all outstanding members of the Shanghai business community and have always fulfilled their obligations to maintain local security. Therefore, awards will be given to those who excel in academics and other subjects to show encouragement. Yesterday, the association submitted a request to the Municipal Government and the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for awards and requested them to attend the graduation ceremony and deliver speeches.</p>
<p>Continued Training</p>
<p>Shanghai is a place where Chinese and foreigners live together, with a vast area and a dense population of good and bad people mixed together. It is very important for the defense team members to assist in maintaining local security. Therefore, in order to popularize self-defense education among various teams, the association decided to continue the second phase of training after the graduation of the first phase of the cadre training class. The number of trainees will remain the same as originally stipulated, but improvements will be made to achieve greater progress.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Judicial Administration convened a national judicial conference, which was decided to be held in the capital on September 16 of this year. However, the issue of lawyers' participation was raised by Liu Liumin and Lu Shenjunru, standing committee members of the National Lawyers Association, who previously met with Minister Wang Yongbin in the capital and were accepted. It has now been stipulated that the lawyers' circle will have six representatives to participate in the conference. After learning of this situation, the lawyers' associations discussed it one after another, believing that there are a total of sixty or seventy lawyers' associations in various provinces across the country, and how to elect six representatives. Therefore, the association designated Liu Liumin and Chen Yaodong as representatives and set off for the capital a few days ago to continue to request the judicial authorities to increase the number of representatives. There is hope that the number of representatives will be increased.</p>

<p>The Shinshi News Agency reports that the new large-sized Douglas aircraft purchased by the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC), after being assembled, has been conducting test flights in Shanghai for several days with satisfactory results. For the purpose of a long-distance test flight, the company specially arranged for pilot Mr. White to fly the aircraft, along with a radio operator, from the Longhua Airport at around 7:00 AM yesterday morning to Peiping. Mr. Dai Enji, General Manager of the company, also accompanied the flight. After taking off from Shanghai, the aircraft safely arrived at the Ming Palace Airport in Nanjing at 9:30 AM, taking one hour and ten minutes. Mr. Dai immediately went to the Ministry of Transportation to meet with Minister Zhu and extended an invitation to some people from various circles in Nanjing to take a test flight. In the afternoon, Mr. Dai and others returned to Shanghai on the same aircraft, and the flight performance was excellent. The company has planned to officially add the aircraft to the Shanghai-Peiping route on the first of next month to carry passengers. The Shanghai-Peiping route was originally scheduled for three round trips each week. Now that the new aircraft has been added, it will be increased and changed to six round trips each week from Tuesday to Sunday, doubling the previous number. Therefore, the transportation between Shanghai and Peiping will be more convenient.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Art Exhibition, Preview on the Thirteenth Day <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 20th) was the thirteenth day of the Shanghai preview of the International Exhibition of Chinese Art in London. Because the weather was fine and it was Saturday, the number of visitors was even more crowded, and the scene was unprecedented in the past few days. It is estimated that the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued group tickets for over a thousand people yesterday, and several hundred people from Jinan University also came to visit. Together with visitors from other circles, the number reached three thousand. The number of people outside requesting to purchase tickets to enter was even more constant. However, in order to maintain order at the venue, the association limited the number of visitors each day to no more than three thousand. Therefore, those who want to visit the association should purchase tickets early to avoid disappointment. The date of shipping the antiques to England has been set for May 28th. The association is currently working overtime to rush the construction of boxes and prepare customs clearance procedures. The preview will be closed on the 30th of this month. After the closing, the antiques will be packed in boxes. This packing procedure is complicated and will take two weeks to complete. The first chapter of the explanation of the calligraphy and painting compiled by the association, the general outline, has been published in yesterday's newspaper. Now, the third chapter of the explanation, "The Evolution of Calligraphy and Its Famous Masters," is recorded below. By reading this, the situation of Chinese calligraphy can be understood.</p>
<p>The Evolution of Calligraphy and Its Famous Masters</p>
<p>Calligraphy is a kind of Chinese art. Its development can be divided into five periods. From the Shang and Zhou Dynasties to the Qin Dynasty, characters that contained pictographic elements evolved into the Great Seal Script and the Small Seal Script. This is the first period. Many of the characters from this period that have survived, such as those on bronzes and stone carvings, can still be studied. At the end of the Qin Dynasty, the Eight-Part Script was created, and during the Han Dynasty, the Clerical Script, the Cursive Script, and the Wild Cursive Script were created. Zhong Yao of the Wei Dynasty and Wang Xizhi of the Jin Dynasty were famous for their running script and standard script, which are today's styles of calligraphy. Their authentic works still exist in the world, and they became the great masters of today's style of calligraphy. Calligraphers of all dynasties could not surpass their scope until the end of the Six Dynasties. During this period, the Northern Dynasties formed a slightly different school (such as Zheng Xi, etc.), which was majestic, upright, and neat, with its own characteristics. This is the second period. By the Sui Dynasty, the North and the South merged, thus opening the prelude to the Tang Dynasty. Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty, Ouyang Xun, Chu Suiliang, Xue Ji, Lu Jianzhi, Sun Qianli, Zhang Xu, Yan Zhenqing, Huai Su, Liu Gongquan, Li Yong, and Xu Hao each had their own expertise and established their own schools. Literati such as Li Bai, Lin Zao, and Du Mu were all known for their calligraphy. Yang Ningshi of the Five Dynasties integrated various schools and can be called a rising force. This is the third period of calligraphy. Huang Tingjian and Mi Fu continued Yang's efforts and opened the Song Dynasty's special school of calligraphy with four great masters. Later, Emperor Huizong advocated the Slender Gold Script. Emperor Gaozong spent twenty years in Deshou Palace, concentrating on the calligraphy of the Wang brothers. Therefore, literati such as Cai Jing, Zhou Bangyan, Fan Chengda, Zhang Xiaoxiang, Jiang Kui, Lu You, Wu Ju, Wu Shuo, Zhu Xi, and Yue Ke were all famous for their calligraphy. The Liao and Jin people entered China, and culturally, they were assimilated by China. Therefore, Ren Xunwang Tingyun of the Jin Dynasty and Zhao Mengfu of the Yuan Dynasty rose rapidly. Zhao Mengfu was proficient in both calligraphy and painting and can be called the great master of this period. In addition, Xian Yushu, Kangli Shankuai, Yu Ji, Zhang Yu, Jie Xisi, and Yu He of the Yuan Dynasty also had their own unique characteristics. This is the fourth period. The Ming Dynasty inherited the legacy of the Yuan Dynasty. Calligraphers such as Song Ke, Song Lian, Li Dongyang, Zhu Yunming, Wen Zhengming, and Wang Chong all had their own expertise. Dong Qichang later integrated all the styles and was also proficient in both calligraphy and painting. At the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, most of the calligraphers were influenced by him. Wang Duo, Wang Shizhen, Jiang Chenying, Jin Nong, Wang Shu, Liu Yong, Weng Fanggang, and Yi Bingshou were relatively outstanding. After the Jiaqing period, people were tired of the lifelessness of the Pavilion Style and turned to learning the style of stele inscriptions, which changed the calligraphy style. Calligraphy was slightly revitalized, and Deng Shiru and Bao Shichen were representatives of this style. This is the fifth period. (The evolution of calligraphy and its famous masters will be continued tomorrow.)</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce petitioned the Ministry of Transportation to extend the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hong Kong route to Singapore. The Ministry of Transportation ordered the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to reply. The company replied that the company has 26 ships, including its own ships and rented ships, which are operating in various ports in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and they are still not enough to allocate. Moreover, they are not suitable for long-distance ocean voyages. The recently built Hai Yuan, Hai Heng, Hai Li, and Hai Zhen are all four ships, because they are dedicated to domestic navigation needs, so their tonnage and manufacturing are also suitable for the business of coastal ports, and it is really inconvenient to navigate to Singapore. As for the development of the Nanyang route, although the company has considered planning, it has not been realized due to the current economic inability to increase the tonnage. The various points requested by the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce are actually difficult to implement. As for the exhibits of the association, they can only be transported by the company's original domestic routes to Hong Kong. In the future, the freight rate can be reduced with reference to the past exhibition transport precedents to show distinction. The Ministry of Transportation has notified the Ministry of Industry to be notified separately.</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications yesterday, stating: "To whom it may concern, on the 19th of this month, our Jiangwan branch office reported that the staff stationed in Yinhang District stated that the area's commerce is becoming increasingly prosperous and business contacts are becoming more frequent, but only the municipal office has a telephone in the district, which is insufficient for practical use. Therefore, we specially request that you forward this to the Telephone Bureau to install public telephones to facilitate public communication. According to this, the above-mentioned situation is indeed true and should be installed as soon as possible for convenience. We hereby submit this to you, and we request that you forward it to the Shanghai Telephone Bureau for approval to install, which would be greatly appreciated." Upon investigation, it was found that there is only one telephone installed in the Yinhang district, in the municipal office, which is used by the public, which is indeed inconvenient. If public telephones are added to the district, it will be convenient for the public and will gradually cultivate the habit of people using telephones, which will also benefit your bureau's business. In view of the above situation, we hereby send a letter to your bureau to request your approval, to install it as soon as possible for communication. This is our sincere request.</p>

<p>The headquarters office of the Shanghai Solicitation Team of the China Aviation Association convened its ninth office meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday at the Youth Association office to discuss the direction of the solicitation work. The attendees included Chief Secretary Li Dachao, Secretaries Zhang Yuliang, Zhou Xin, Song Zheng, Gu Shangrui, Lu Zhangyan, Li Jimin, Zhu Shengyang, Bao Lengxue, Liu Songtao, Zou Junzhang, Chen Shuo, etc. Chairman Li Dachao, Recording Secretary Chen Shuo. The middle seat report briefly stated that since the launch of the solicitation campaign, the team leaders have been working hard to carry out their work separately, and have reported on their progress or sent membership fees and donations to the office. It is hoped that the field secretaries will work hard to connect and liaise, and should sacrifice their spirit and work hard to assist the team leaders, deputy team leaders, and team members in their activities, regardless of time or space. The Boy Scouts will mobilize to raise donations for aviation salvation, and it is planned to hold it for one or two days, aiming for 30,000 yuan. The plan has been decided and will be launched after consultation with the Boy Scout Council. The office will directly solicit members by sending letters to households, companies, stores, and institutions in the city that have telephones, and will also publish notices in newspapers. Also, since the solicitation began, letters have been received from Henan, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Zhenjiang, Qingpu, and other places, requesting to join. The people of the country enthusiastically support the aviation salvation movement. A few days ago, Mr. Wen Shouxin, an overseas Chinese in Siam, sent a letter to Mayor Wu, along with the aviation salvation donation he had raised. Even though he is far away, his enthusiasm is admirable. The Aviation Association has purchased an airplane, and two female aviators, Li Yueying and Li Quanyu, will fly across the country to promote the cause, which can strengthen our forces. It has been decided that when they fly to a certain place, a branch will be established in that place. Regarding the collection of aviation salvation donations from hotels, most hotels are working hard to collect, but a small number of hotels of the C and D grades are not working hard enough. In addition to persuading them to work hard, if they are still perfunctory, they will be warned in the newspaper and other methods will be used to deal with them, etc.</p>
<p>The headquarters office has received membership fees and donations from various team leaders in the past month, which has been very enthusiastic and has been repeatedly reported in the newspapers. It is also reported that Team Leader Xu Jinyuan of Team 250 has submitted membership fees of 534 yuan, and Team Leader Yang Meinan of Team 202 has continued to submit membership fees of 140 yuan. In addition, Mr. Shi Shengzhi personally donated 300 yuan, and Mr. Zhu Ziqian personally donated 200 yuan. The office has counted the items and issued receipts. Overseas Chinese in various countries are extremely concerned about various undertakings in their motherland. It is reported that Mayor Wu received a letter yesterday from Wen Shouxin, an overseas Chinese at the Xishiheai Buren Pharmacy in Siam, stating that Liang Anyu had collected 33 baht for aviation salvation donations, equivalent to 61.45 national currency, and had entrusted the Penang Overseas Chinese Bank to remit it. Please check and forward it. After receiving the letter, Mayor Wu immediately forwarded it to the headquarters office for counting, and wrote a personal letter of thanks, asking him to publicize it widely so that all overseas Chinese could donate and contribute to the great cause of aviation salvation.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Municipal Bureau of Weights and Measures - Preparing for a General Inspection of All Households in the City - Inspection of the Chinese and Rental Areas Has Already Begun This Year - Public Security Bureau and Others Assist, Focusing on Shops and Vegetable Markets <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The first general inspection of this year by the Municipal Social Bureau's Bureau of Weights and Measures has already begun, starting with the Chinese area, focusing on shops, vegetable markets, and rural towns, while actively promoting a general inspection of more than one million households throughout the city, which is also planned to be carried out. The following is a report from a reporter of the Dagong News Agency on the various situations:</p>
<p>Focus of General Inspection: Shops and Vegetable Markets</p>
<p>Since the authorities urged citizens to actively promote the new system of weights and measures, it has been implemented in both the Chinese and French areas. However, the concession area has not yet been properly negotiated, so no inspection has been carried out. The Municipal Bureau of Weights and Measures is deeply concerned that a small number of citizens may be outwardly compliant but inwardly resistant, and has specifically stipulated that a general inspection will be carried out twice a year. The first general inspection this year has already begun, and the public security bureaus and district police officers of the respective jurisdictions will assist in the handling. The inspection will focus on shops and small vegetable markets. If it is found that a shop has privately manufactured or used weights and measures, the weights and measures will be confiscated, and the shop name and the shopkeeper's name will be reported to the Social Bureau for referral to the court for punishment. In the small vegetable markets, inspectors will carry weights to verify the instruments at any time. If any discrepancies are found, they will be destroyed on the spot to show a warning. After the general inspection of the Chinese area is completed, the police will be convened to inspect various districts of the French Concession.</p>
<p>Active Promotion in Rural Towns and Villages</p>
<p>In various rural towns and villages near this city, such as Pudong Mitsubishi Pond, Yangjing Town, Laolonghua in the western district of Shanghai, Xinlonghua, Caohejing, and Zhabei District, Jiangwan District, Pusong District, Wusong District, Pengpei District, etc., personnel are actively dispatched to promote, follow up on the publicity and urge reform and implementation, so that farmers understand the needs and benefits of the new system of weights and measures, and gradually expect to automatically abandon the old system, in order to achieve practical results, and then start the inspection.</p>
<p>Planned Inspection of All Households in the City</p>
<p>Regarding the work of inspecting the weights and measures of all households in the city, Director Zhou said yesterday that this city is a major commercial port in the country, densely populated, with a total of more than one million households. If the inspection period is uninterrupted every day, it will take a year. However, promoting the new system is the responsibility of the government, and we will actively proceed without any difficulties. We are now drafting plans and procedures, and after approval from the competent authority, we will send all inspectors to set off in different districts and implement a general inspection of households.</p>

<h3 id="e153">Major Fire in Zhabei Last Night - More Than a Hundred Thatched Houses Reduced to Ashes - Fire Engines from All Districts Fully Mobilized <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>No. 269 Changan Road, Zhabei, is a glass bottle old goods store, opened by Wu Changshan from Jiangbei. The house is a flat-roofed house covered with lead sheets. The back house is inhabited by the Wang family, the second landlord. At around 8:10 last night, a fire suddenly broke out in the house inhabited by the Wang family. At that time, Wu Changshan, his wife Yang, and another tenant, Yuan Yan, had gone out to attend a lottery party. When the Wang family saw the cause of the trouble, they could not put it out and immediately ran away. Therefore, by the time the outside noticed, the fire had become uncontrollable. At the same time, the back of the city house was still a thatched house, totaling no less than a hundred or so. In addition, the southeast wind was strong last night, so the fire spread to the left, right, and rear of the house in no time. The fire was so bright that it could not be approached. For a while, the noise was deafening, and the order was in chaos. People helped the old and carried the young, scrambling to run away. Fortunately, the Xinzha Patrol Station was nearby. After discovering the fire, they immediately notified the fire brigade to send fire engines to the scene to put out the fire. At the same time, a full team of armed police officers and the city security team were dispatched to assist in maintaining order. However, the fire was raging at this time, so the water sprayed by the fire engines was not very effective. All the thatched houses in the area were lined up vertically and horizontally, making rescue even more difficult. In the blink of an eye, it turned into a fire pit. The firefighters saw that the fire engines from all four sections of Zhabei were still not enough, so they notified the fire brigades of the Nanshi districts and Dongjiadu to drive fire engines to assist in putting out the fire. After the firefighters worked hard and bravely, they managed to prevent the fire from spreading further. However, the area affected by the disaster was already very vast. It is estimated that from Changan Road, north to the back of Linxiangli on Hengtong Road, east to Linfengli on Huasheng Road, and west to the thatched houses around Tong'anli on Huasheng Road, more than a hundred houses, as well as the Cuiyuan Lumber Store and the pine stack on Changan Road, were destroyed by the fire. The fire was slightly extinguished until about 11:00, but flames still broke out from time to time, and the smell was offensive. The firefighters continued to dispatch fire engines to spray water. It was not until midnight at 12:00 that the fire was completely extinguished. In total, more than a hundred thatched houses, four lead-skinned city houses, and one stack were burned down. The loss cannot be estimated for a while. All the general disaster victims were sitting on the street with one mat each, with sad faces and miserable shapes. After the incident, the governing branch bureau, because the fire starter was not found, summoned the three tenants, Wu Changshan, and others to question the cause of the fire. At the same time, the firefighters were afraid that there would be a tragic case of people being burned to death, so they turned over the rubble in different ways. However, as of the time the reporter finished writing, no bodies burned to death had been found, and no population loss incidents had been reported by the disaster victims. According to the observation of the firefighters, it is roughly hoped that they will be spared, which is a great blessing in misfortune.</p>

<p>The Fire Department of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, in order to expand the city's fire-fighting equipment, has self-made two of the largest giant pump fire engines. One of them has been under construction since last winter, lasting more than three months, and was fully completed last month. The test results were very good. In addition, another one was also completed on the 15th of this month, and the test results were also very satisfactory. According to Dong Zhihe of the bureau, the fire engine will hold a commissioning ceremony in two weeks. At that time, Mayor Wu, Director Cai, the Public Concession Fire Brigade, and the leaders of the Zhabei Nanshi Fire Brigade will attend to participate. The ceremony will be very grand. The fire engine is planned to be assigned to the Caojiadu Fire Brigade for application, because the Caojiadu area is lined with factories and is a mixture of Chinese and foreigners, so it is particularly necessary to increase fire protection strength.</p>

<p>The filming of supernatural films in this city has disappeared since the Central Film Inspection Committee, in conjunction with the Education and Public Security Bureaus, conducted a major search. However, after a long time, the companies still privately filmed the situation. The Municipal Education Bureau has repeatedly heard about it, but the filming of these films is extremely secret and cannot be found. At around 11:00 AM yesterday, the Municipal Education Bureau received a tip that the Baihong Film Company on Haige Road was filming the forbidden supernatural film "Journey to the West." Director Pan assigned a special commissioner to go to the company with officers from the Special Affairs Section of the Public Security Bureau to secretly investigate, but nothing was found. They waited nearby. At around 3:00 PM in the afternoon, several naked girls were found in the Yu's Villa west of Jiaotong University, talking and laughing. They were detected and tried to escape from the back door, but they were stopped by the armed officers and were all detained. On the spot, a camera with a tripod, a single-edged sword, a flowered spear, dozens of supernatural costumes, shoes, and hats, and many other props were seized. Eight male and female actors were also sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for referral to the Central Film Inspection Committee for handling.</p>

<p>Tang Sifeng, a woman from Anhui, 21 years old, has been working as a trainee nurse at Guangren Hospital on Xinzha Road for two years. Recently, she suddenly felt some kind of irritation and suddenly developed the idea of厭世. At around 10:00 PM the night before last, she secretly injected morphine in her bedroom to commit suicide. After her companion Zhu Fengying discovered it, she reported it to the hospital's doctor to find a way to treat her. However, because the poisoning was too deep, it was impossible to save her life, and she died soon after. The hospital reported it to the Xinzha Police Station, and ordered detectives to investigate. Then, the body was sent to the Forensic Examination Office on Peilun Road. Yesterday morning, Song Qiyou, a prosecutor from the First Special District District Court, accompanied by two forensic doctors Wei and Zhang, and clerk Wang Zuyi, came to the office to examine the body. According to Zhu Fengying, also a nurse at the hospital, at about 7:00 PM that day, after we finished our work, the deceased came to my bedroom to chat, and there was nothing abnormal. Later, she wanted to go back to her bedroom and insisted on asking me to send her, but I did not agree because it was raining at the time. Then, she suddenly went and came back and told me that she had injected morphine to commit suicide. I then reported to the doctor. As for why she took this measure, I don't know, etc. According to Elver, an American woman working at the hospital, the deceased's brother is still in Hankou, and the hospital will collect the body on behalf of him, etc. After Song Jun obtained the supply, he concluded that the deceased Tang Sifeng, female, was indeed poisoned to death before her death. The brother of the deceased did not arrive at the scene, and the corpse was handed over to Guangren Hospital to receive. It is also heard that the name of the brother of the corpse is Tang Shiquan, who is now a military trainer at a university in Hankou.</p>

<p>At 9:45 AM yesterday, the director of the Hankou Bank's business department at No. 310 Peng Road, Hongkou, sent an employee, Japanese Hide Minta, to deliver 9,000 yuan to the Interchange Department of China Tongshang Bank at No. 66 Zhaopu Road. Because Hide was close, he did not take a car, but went on foot. Unexpectedly, when he was walking through the intersection of Tiantong Road and Zhaopu Road, three bandits wearing miscellaneous short clothes suddenly jumped out from the side of the road to intercept the road, and one of the thieves showed a pistol. The Japanese was silent, and the other two thieves searched wildly. As a result, the banknotes and cash hidden around him were stolen. Afterwards, Hide reported the robbery situation and the amount of loss to the Hongkou Police Station in charge to investigate. After receiving the report, the West patrol head immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the area to arrest them. However, it had been a long time, and the bandits had fled far away.</p>

<p>Jiang Deyu and Ma Baisheng, detectives from the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police Team, learned the day before yesterday that a group of thieves would be going to Xiaodong at night to commit a crime. At 8:00 that night, they followed the group to Bajiaqiao, south of Tangqiao, Pudong, and immediately took the opportunity to report to the local police station, ordering patrol officers Chen Youde, Jia Shiqi, Li Jiajun, etc. to assist in detaining Zhou Jinlong, Ding Yudong, Li Yinsheng, Wang A'er, Xia Gentao, Wang Jinsheng, Li Genfu, and other seven people.

<p>Jiang Azhuan, a Wuxi native residing at No. 2, Hewu Lane, Vermon Road, French Concession (named Azhuan because he had a near-death experience in his early years, meaning "returned from death"), was 56 years old and engaged in the ironmongery business. On the morning of the 19th, he went out on business. At noon, around 12:00 PM, while returning home, he was crossing Avenue Joffre (at the intersection of Vermon Road) from south to north in front of No. 148 Avenue Joffre when a car, No. 6256, belonging to Zhou Liying (transliteration, British), a commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, driven by the chauffeur Zhao Longdi (18 years old, local), was traveling east to west on its way back to residence No. 536 West End Avenue. Jiang could not avoid it and was knocked down by the left rear fender of the car. At that moment, another car, No. 1950, driven by a vice-consul of a certain country, Difaer (transliteration), was following closely behind. Unable to brake in time, the wheels ran over Jiang, causing severe injuries. Officer No. 312, stationed nearby, immediately recorded the license plate numbers of both cars and took the injured man to the Avenue Joffre Police Station, from where he was transferred to Guangci Hospital. Due to severe head and internal injuries, treatment was ineffective, and he died at 2:30 PM that afternoon. The hospital notified the police station, which transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Mortuary for an autopsy. Yesterday morning, the police station reported to the Second Special District Court Procuratorate.

<h3 id="e161">The Troubles of Wealth: Qiu Changsheng Family Inheritance Dispute Leads to Another Lawsuit. Qiu Changsheng's Cousin Hengbao Files a Suit Claiming Encroachment on Ancestral Property, Alleging Four Generations Living Together and Selling Property to Open a Business, Accumulating Considerable Wealth <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>After the death of Qiu Xiaoqing, who started his career in the pigment business and became a wealthy merchant, his family has been involved in inheritance disputes for years, repeatedly filing lawsuits. However, in each lawsuit, Qiu Changsheng, Qiu’s adopted son who inherited the assets, resolved the disputes by providing funds for settlements, without any clear victories or defeats. However, the Qiu family has many members, so as one dispute subsides, another arises, leaving Changsheng in a situation where he is helping one only for another one to fail. Now, his cousin, Qiu Hengbao, has hired a lawyer and filed a criminal self-accusation with the First Special District Court against Changsheng, Changyin (two brothers) and Qiu Qiyuan, QiYu, and Qitai (grandsons of Qiu Weiqing’s brother, Qiu Peisan), accusing them of encroaching on ancestral property.</p>
<p>Criminal Self-accusation requesting that all the defendants be punished according to Article 356 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhan Liangce opened a court session to summon and interrogate the parties involved. Only Changsheng, Qiyuan, and the twelve-year-old Qitai appeared as defendants. Qiyu was in Changshu undergoing military training, and Changyin, being under thirteen years old, did not appear. After Judge Zhan clarified the ages, addresses, and occupations of the plaintiffs and defendants who appeared in court, he ordered the plaintiff, Qiu Hengbao, to state the facts of the accusations. He claimed that the Changsheng brothers were his nephews, and the Qiyuan brothers were his grandnephews. They were close relatives who all revered the same ancestor. Weiqing, Peisan, and he were</p>
<p>Paternal Cousins, Weiqing’s father, Qiu Shirong, was his paternal uncle. In the fourteenth year of the Guangxu reign, Shirong and Shixiang jointly sold seven and a half mu of land located in Dashatou to a man named Zhang, and the proceeds were given to Weiqing and Peisan to come to Shanghai and establish the Dechangrun Pigment Store in partnership with Bei Runsheng and Zhao Yuting. At that time, he was not yet born, so he was later told about the sale of the property by his aunt. However, when Weiqing was alive, he frequently distributed the remaining profits from the business, sometimes three thousand or five thousand, etc., and when he died the defendants collectively occupied, no distribution was ever made. His family has lived together for four generations. The ancestral property has never been divided, but the Shanghai residences of Peisan and Weiqing had already been separated. Whenever he came to Shanghai, he</p>
<p>Resided in Weiqing’s home, and so on. When questioned, the defendant Qiu Changsheng stated that Hengbao was his cousin, and there was originally no ancestral property, so the family had not been separated. Dechangrun was established by his father, Weiqing, his uncle, Peisan, and Zhao Yuting, and had no relationship with Yuan Runsheng. The plaintiff had no shares and had never been given dividends. Since there was no ancestral property in his hometown, there was certainly no sale of ancestral property to use the proceeds to start the store. When the plaintiff's lawyer saw that Qiu was denying everything, he presented Qiu's family genealogy, Qiu Weiqing's obituary, and other documents, and stated that Qiu's family had lived under the same roof for four generations, and the family property had not been divided. In the family genealogy</p>
<p>It Would Be Easy To Prove. While Weiqing’s obituary proved that Weiqing’s parents and wife were in their hometown, and were living with the plaintiff, because the pigment industry was not a big business before the European War, and those in this business were not big merchants, they still left their families in their hometown. Since both parties were living together and sharing wealth, the plaintiff should have had the right to acquire shares in Dechangrun, and Qiu Changsheng was Weiqing's adopted son, which was very clear in the obituary. The defendant’s defense attorney also presented a settlement document from 1932 when Qiu Hengbao’s brother, Qiu Hengcai, was involved in a lawsuit with Qiu Changsheng over the family property, stating that there was also a statement in that document that there was no ancestral property whatsoever, and Qiu Hengbao had also</p>
<p>Signed the Document. The court then turned the document over to Qiu Hengbao, and Qiu only admitted to signing the document, but stated that he did not understand the contents because he was not very literate, and that his brother Hengcai had only asked him to sign as a witness so that he could get 80,000 yuan. Judge Zhan interrogated Zhang Yucai, the witness, about the purchase of the land from the Qiu family. According to Zhang, seven mu of land in Dashatou was jointly sold to him by Qiu Shixiang and Shirong, but many years had passed, the deed had long been burned in a fire, and the land had also been submerged. The witnesses in the case have all since died. The court then scheduled a continued hearing for the afternoon of April 27th.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Yu Huogen Admits Strangling His Own Son; Gestures While Confessing; What He Says Is Vividly Described <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Yu Huogen, a villager from Yu Jiatang in the south of Hongqiao in Shanghai's west, colluded with his daughter-in-law, Chen, to strangle his son, Yu Guanhong (also known as Jilin), with a rope late at night. The District Court, led by Prosecutor Lei Binzhang, has already opened the coffin at the scene, verified that he had been strangled to death while alive, and ordered a proper reburial. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that Yu Huogen had two sons, the elder son, Yu Guanhong (the deceased), and the younger son, Guanming, who both married early. Guanming died of illness the year before last, leaving behind a blind widow. The family's life was quite difficult. In addition, Guanhong became a degenerate and developed addictions. Valuables in the home were stolen by Guanhong and pawned for money. He even stole property from other families. Therefore, the father, who was over sixty years old, hated him to the bone. Although he repeatedly advised him, his bad habits were difficult to change, so he decided to murder his degenerate son to eliminate future troubles. After the case occurred, his daughter-in-law, Yu Chen, was detained by the police and questioned by the court. When the judge arrived at the scene for inspection, Yu Huogen (the perpetrator), the father of the deceased, frankly admitted that he had murdered his son and said that because of his degenerate son's various misdeeds, he did not even consider the consequences and carried out the murder. In the middle of the night on the tenth day of this month, taking advantage of his son's sound sleep, he brought a rope into the room, got on the bed, and put the rope around his son's neck. He was just about to tighten it when his son woke up and resisted. Because he was old and weak, he could not resist, so he quickly called his daughter-in-law to come and help hold down his son's legs. He was able to calmly tighten the rope, and his son quickly died. When Yu Huogen confessed, he gestured vividly, and his description was vivid. The judge originally intended to take him to the court for detention, but Yu Huogen suffered from ascites, with a belly as big as a five-stone gourd, and it was difficult for him to move, so he ordered the local guarantor to take good care of him. However, Yu Chen denied helping to commit the crime. The judge believed that the case was clear and that a public prosecution could be initiated in a few days.</p>

Yesterday morning, Shen was working on the scaffolding outside the ninth floor. At 11:30 AM, Shen went down from the scaffolding to have lunch.

<p>To the Editor, I am writing regarding the news item published in your newspaper about Chen Dimin and his wife, which involved Ms. Luo'e's reputation. Luo'e's surname is Wu, but your newspaper mistakenly reported it as Hu. The false title of "President of the Flowers" belongs to Luo'e herself, but it has been mistaken for her sister. This is a matter of reputation, as her sister is a respectable woman with many siblings, which is very detrimental. We hope you will correct it. Yours sincerely, Wu Luo'e, April 20th.</p>

<h3 id="e176">The Dung King's Inheritance Lawsuit Continues: Old Accountant Attends Court Ill, Ordered to Submit Account Books Within Five Days <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The late Ma Fuqi (also known as Gu Fuqi), the "Dung King" residing on Rue de Villermont in the French Concession, and his wife A Gui Ru, accumulated millions in assets through contracting cleaning services in the British and French concessions and the four districts of Nantao and Zhabei in Japan. They also engaged in rickshaw and real estate businesses. They had three sons: Hongkui (the eldest), Hongsheng (the second), and Honggen (the third). After the deaths of Ma and his wife, all inheritance and business operations were managed by the eldest son, Hongkui. Hongkui also passed away due to illness last autumn, leaving behind his wives, Chen and Wang, and a son and two daughters. Recently, Hongkui's wife, Ma Chen, along with her children, hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the Special Court against her husband's younger brother, Ma Honggen, her husband's concubine, Ma Wang, and Wan Sanduo, the old accountant who had served for many years, alleging</p>
<p>conspiracy to embezzle public and private inheritance, amounting to four million gold. Judge Qiu Huan Ying of the Special Court has held two hearings and personally visited Wan Sanduo's home to question him (due to Wan being bedridden), where Wan handed over the iron box key and insurance policies. The court ordered a postponement for further hearings and instructed both parties to attempt reconciliation during the adjournment, as detailed in previous reports. Yesterday morning, the third hearing took place. The plaintiff, Ma Chen, and the defendants, Ma Honggen and Ma Wang, each attended with their lawyers. The third defendant, Wan Sanduo, was compelled to attend due to his designation as a defendant. He was seated in a rattan chair, carried to the courthouse by two servants</p>
<p>to await the hearing. At ten o'clock, Judge Qiu, accompanied by court clerk Zhang Guan Cheng, opened the Second Criminal Court for the hearing. After summoning and identifying the parties involved, the judge first questioned Zhu Xuan, the assistant accountant of the Ma family, regarding the rental income from the properties. Zhu testified that he only managed the collection of funds and had no land registers, only property rental forms, with an annual income of approximately 59,000 yuan. He then pointed out the relevant entries in the account books submitted previously. The court then questioned the defendant Ma Honggen about whether reconciliation had been attempted during the adjournment. Ma replied that no reconciliation had been reached due to their lack of sincerity. Ma's defense lawyer then stated in court that Tan Keng Fu and others had contacted Ma Chen regarding the matter, but</p>
<p>the figures presented by the two sides differed too greatly, with one side claiming assets of four million and the other claiming only over ten thousand, leading to no resolution. The plaintiff, Ma Chen, stated that she was willing to reconcile if they turned over the assets, but would not agree to reconciliation if the difference was too great. She asserted that the assets were indeed four million yuan, as she had heard her mother-in-law and husband say before their deaths. The judge then said to Chen, "You are all one family, you should each make concessions, why insist so stubbornly?" The judge then inquired about the deposit in the Ma Hong Ji branch of the Bank of China. Ma Honggen replied that the funds were from his brother Hongsheng's personal business managing the public concession's</p>
<p>garbage and not jointly owned. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that "Ma Hong Ji" was a shared name, while names like "Hong Ji," "Kui Hong Ji," "Wang Ji," and "Hong Gen Ji" were separate names for each individual. The judge then questioned the second defendant, Ma Wang, about the custody of the seals and keys to the safe and iron box, after which he questioned the third defendant, Wan Sanduo. Wan was still carried to the court by servants. Unable to stand, he was questioned while seated. The judge loudly questioned Wan about the existence of a general ledger of the Ma family's assets and the management of the property rentals. Wan, hard of hearing due to his illness and speaking in a low voice, required a bailiff to relay the questions. Wan replied that the Ma family had no</p>
<p>general land register. He and Wu Zhongming managed a portion of the rent, while Te Back &amp; Co. and the Fair Foreign Company managed the rest. The court then questioned him further about the amount of rent he managed, stating, "You have helped this family for several decades, now that they are in a lawsuit, you should speak from your conscience." Wan replied that there were rent receipts and other evidence that could be checked. He had only taken over as the chief accountant on January 16th of last year. Before that, he merely assisted the old lady, A Gui Jie, in running errands. Later, Hongkui managed the business and consulted with him. He now submitted three reports each month to the three people. When asked about Hongkui's seal, Wan replied that it was still in the iron box. The court then ordered Wan to submit the account books and property lists from 1915 within five days, and instructed both parties to jointly engage accountants to liquidate the assets. The case was adjourned to be heard again at a later date and the court was dismissed.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Li Huitang and Bao Jiaping Take on Difficult Roles: South China Secures Special Silver Shield, Defeats Police Team 2-1 <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong News: The annual Special Silver Shield football competition, established in 1897, has been held for 35 sessions. The Royal Navy and Marines Football Team has the best overall record, with South China having won the championship three times. This year's 36th edition, after weeks of intense competition, resulted in South China and the Western Police teams reaching the final. The final match was held at the Hong Kong Football Club ground at 4:15 PM on Saturday, the 13th. Knowing that the Western Police team was strong defensively, South China asked the "Football King" Li Huitang and the "Iron Hand" Bao Jiaping to take on extremely difficult roles to enhance their attacking power and defense. The two, feeling they could not refuse the call of duty, selflessly agreed. As a result, South China's strength surged, attracting the attention of football fans. An endless stream of people spared time to attend the match, and the vast Hong Kong Football Club ground was instantly packed, a rare sight in recent times. As a result of the match, the heavenly star's destiny came true, and the holy water general's sudden kick secured South China's fame, winning this year's championship with a score of 2-1, earning them a place in the annals of history.</p>
<p>Bao Jiaping's Contribution is Greatest</p>
<p>Before describing the battle, this reporter will attempt to assess the performances of both sides. South China's victory was hard-earned, and the greatest contribution came from Bao Jiaping. His saves of dangerous shots were beyond the abilities of others. He certainly earned applause, and I say that South China's victory is owed to Bao's efforts. Second to him were Li Gan and Lin Depu, with Yang Benhan also performing well. "Football King" Li Huitang showed his brilliance once again, but because he had been away from practice for so long, he was not as agile as in the past, but his strength remained. As for the Western Police team, their forwards were mediocre and repeatedly missed opportunities, especially Ji Lian. Di Pai Lu and Morse were still active, but because the midfielders' shots were inaccurate, they were not outstanding. On the defensive end, Pak Kin Shi's saves of dangerous shots, Parker Spiro's clearances, and Goff Brooks' defensive and offensive support were actually better than South China's. The reason why South China was able to frequently penetrate the Western Police's defense was because the Western Police team was intimidated by Li Huitang's reputation. In addition to using Goff to defend him, they also had Brooks assist. Parker continued to defend Yang Shuiyi closely, so their left side and center were very solid, but this shifted the weakness to the right side, where only Blakeburn defended Li Shiyou. Blakeburn, as a defender, dared not go too far forward, nor too far back, which is why Li Shiyou was more active than Yang Shuiyi. South China was thus able to take the opportunity to attack, and the Western Police team could not help but find themselves in danger. The two goals they conceded were both impossible to save, so South China's victory was not accidental. The details of the performance are recorded below:</p>
<p>First Half: No Winner</p>
<p>After both sides arranged their formations, South China immediately kicked off and attacked. Before reaching the midfield line, the ball was intercepted and the Western Police launched a counterattack with great momentum, advancing to South China's goal, but were unable to shoot. Li Gan stole the ball and sent it forward. Li Huitang advanced to the Western Police's back line, but lost an opportunity due to slowness. Li Shiyou then attacked again, getting an opportunity to cross the ball. The ball passed in front of the goal, but Li Zhaorong was unable to meet it in time, missing another opportunity. Parker cleared the ball and assisted the forwards in attacking. Brooks took a long shot, which Bao Jiaping caught with one hand, finally clearing the danger. Li Huitang received the ball and counterattacked, with Li Zhaorong assisting him. They forced a corner kick. Yang Shuiyi kicked it in well. Li Huitang responded with a shot, but unfortunately it missed the mark. At this point, the two sides had been fighting for over twenty minutes, but had not yet opened the scoring. Later, the Western Police team made a stunning move. Di Pai Lu broke through from the side and took a quick shot. Although Bao Jiaping caught it, it still resulted in a corner kick. Di Pai Lu kicked it in well. Stephens kicked it high and away. The Western Police's attack failed, and Li Shiyou seized the opportunity, making a long drive and dribbling past Blakeburn to cross the ball. Pak Kin Shi pounced to save it. The ball rolled back to Li Shiyou's feet. Li kicked it, but Xin Shipi was alert and stood in the goal. Seeing the ball coming, he knelt to save it and clear the danger, ensuring that the defense was not breached. Working together as brothers, Di Pai Lu</p>
<p>counterattacked and won another corner kick, but failed to capitalize on it. However, South China</p>
<p>was surrounded for a while. Fortunately, Yang Benhan returned to the rescue, breaking through the encirclement and sending the ball to Li Shiyou for an attack, resulting in a corner kick, but it was saved by Parker. South China then retreated. Western Police team leader Johnston counter-attacked, and South China was in imminent danger. Parker released a cold arrow, which Bao Jiaping hastily slapped away, averting the crisis. Ji Xiao continued to be active, passing to Johnston, who headed the ball out of bounds. South China was in danger again. Before one wave subsided, another rose. The Western Police's three forwards surged forward. Although Bao Jiaping caught the ball, he was forced to concede a corner kick due to the danger. Although the Western Police gained this advantage, they did not get anything out of it. After this, both sides attacked and defended, each with its own dangers, but the result remained the same, with no opening score. The first half ended in a 0-0 draw.</p>
<p>2-1: Winning the Championship</p>
<p>After a ten-minute break, the exhausted troops resumed the battle. The Western Police pressed forward with renewed vigor, but were repelled by Yu Qingyuan and Yang Benhan. The Western Police surged forward like a tide, retreating and advancing in turn. South China, unprepared for this, had their defense breached by Brooks, who sent the ball forward. Morse got an opportunity to shoot. Bao Jiaping knelt to intercept, and the ball rebounded high. Bao quickly caught it and kicked it out, narrowly avoiding danger. South China, having narrowly escaped, sent the ball forward. Li Huitang seized an opportunity to break through. Brooks tried to stop him, but Li could not shoot and lost the opportunity. About thirteen minutes into the half, South China was finally blessed by the god of victory. Yang Shuiyi got the ball and went straight forward, crossing the ball opportunistically. Brooks intercepted it, but the ball rolled back to Yang's feet, and Yang kicked it into the net, opening the scoring. South China, having won, was further encouraged by the spectators, and their momentum increased. But the Western Police team worked even harder because they were behind, and the situation became even more intense. Johnston and Ji Xiao shot in succession, but were both saved by Bao. Bao sent the ball to Yang Benhan, who passed it to Li Shiyou for an attack. Li dribbled past the Western Police's midfield and crossed the ball. Li Huitang responded by heading the ball into the net. Only four minutes had passed since the first goal. South China, having taken a 2-0 lead, still did not slacken. Seeing that the situation was dire, the Western Police adopted a scorched earth strategy. Spiro was switched to the left wing to increase their attacking power. Sure enough, under a desperate effort, they gained the upper hand and surrounded South China several times. Johnston and Stephens shot, but were both saved by Bao Jiaping. South China also attempted several counterattacks, but without success. The Western Police continued their attack and, in the final minute of the match, Ji Lian, taking advantage of Di Pai Lu's cross, headed the ball back, making the score 2-1, and the game ended. The lineups for both sides were as follows:</p>
<p>South China</p>
<p>Bao Jiaping, Yu Qingyuan, Li Gan, Yang Benhan, Lin Depu, Tang Kun, Li Shiyou, Zhuo Shijin, Li Huitang, Li Zhaorong, Yang Shuiyi</p>
<p>Western Police</p>

<p>Yesterday was the eleventh day of the National Reading Movement Conference organized by the China Cultural Construction Association.

The full text of the record is as follows: Today, I am honored by the kindness of the China Cultural Construction Association to have me speak to you about how to study history and geography. I will now present my humble opinions and discuss them with you, and I ask for your guidance.</p>
<p>The Nature of History and Geography</p>
<p>We will now first discuss the nature of the two sciences, history and geography. History is the science that studies the past lives and activities of mankind. Geography is the science that studies the present lives and activities of mankind. The objects of these two sciences are generally the same. However, the study of history takes time as its warp, which means we want to study the course of human life and activities from the most ancient times up to the present. However, human life and activities cannot be separated from the earth, so we cannot but take the study of geography, which studies space, as the weft. As for the study of geography, it takes the surface of the earth as its warp, so the surface of the earth, including the strata below and the atmosphere above, is what we want to study: how humans conquer and utilize the surface of this earth to improve their lives and promote cultural activities. However, humans conquering and utilizing the surface of the earth cannot be accomplished in a single day, so we cannot but take history as the weft. In this way, although history and geography are, one, the study of humans in time, and the other, the study of humans in space, because what they study are human life and activities, they have the effect of being mutually useful and cannot be neglected.</p>
<p>The Object of Study in History and Geography</p>
<p>The so-called life and activities of mankind can generally be divided into five types: political, economic, religious, educational, and artistic. These five types of life and activities form what is called human culture. When we study the history of mankind or of various countries, we take their culture as our object, that is, these five types of life and activities as our object. The same is true for geography. However, because what geography studies, in addition to the above five types of life and activities, also pays special attention to the problem of mankind conquering the surface of the earth, therefore, when we study geography, we also have to simultaneously study the area, natural resources, climate, land and water transportation, etc. of the entire earth or of various countries to see how they affect human life and activities. This is what is commonly called human geography. Recently, some people have said that a history of human culture is the history of mankind conquering and utilizing nature. What is called nature is the object of geography. Then we can also say that history is past human geography, and geography is modern cultural history. Simply put, the object of history is the past culture of mankind, and the object of geography is the culture that mankind continues to create on the surface of the earth in modern times.</p>
<p>Purpose and Value</p>
<p>Our purpose in studying history and geography, like that of other sciences, lies in seeking truth. What is called truth, in history, is the truth of the various lives and activities of mankind in the past in culture, and in geography, is the truth of the various lives and activities of mankind in the present in culture. We want to understand the truth of mankind's past culture to help us determine the path to fight for culture, so that we will not go down the wrong path again. We want to understand the truth of mankind's present culture to serve as a reference for us to create a new culture. Arriving at the usefulness of knowing oneself and knowing one's enemy, I think that this is perhaps the purpose and value of the two sciences of history and geography, and the reason why we should study these two sciences.</p>
<p>The Importance of Seeking Truth</p>
<p>Why do the purposes of history and geography both require seeking truth? This is because truth is originally the highest ideal of mankind. All conclusions that are deliberately false, or that only see a part, do not conform to the spirit of science, and we should all reject them. In studying history and geography, in particular, it is not appropriate to have subjective opinions, or to reverse right and wrong, or to confuse black and white, or to generalize from the particular. Studying history and geography with this kind of view is like wearing a pair of colored glasses to observe everything in front of us. The colors we see are only for our own appreciation, and the conclusions we reach are also only colored conclusions. It is okay to take them to promote personal claims, but if they are regarded as a contribution to science, there is a big problem. This attitude problem is very important, and we who study history and geography must be vigilant at all times to prevent it.</p>
<p>Methods of Studying History and Geography</p>
<p>Since the purpose of studying history and geography is to seek the truth, then we can only adopt the modern so-called scientific method. The characteristics of the scientific method are: first, our attitude must be able to be absolutely objective. When we study history and geography, we must absolutely eliminate our own prejudices, and restore the original appearance of right and wrong. "To know is to know, to not know is to not know," and we must absolutely not add or subtract anything, or only see one part, or only see the majority, we must absolutely not claim to have seen the whole. Then, the characters and events of history, and the people and customs of various places in the modern world, can raise their heads and reveal their true faces, otherwise they will all be hidden in the thick fog of our prejudices. This is the first characteristic of the scientific method, which is an objective attitude. The second is that we should apply observation methods. This method is undoubtedly applicable to geographical research, because we now have many scientific machines and instruments to help us work. For example, to measure the atmosphere and the height of mountains, we can use balloons, airplanes, or airships. To measure the depth and breadth of the ocean and the earth's strata, we can use ships and explosives. To measure the shape of the ground, we can use airplanes. The natural state of the earth today, except for the polar regions because of the cold climate, which still need our efforts, has almost been observed clearly. As for the modern human cultural part, there are also statistics from various governments for reference, and there are also generally ways to deal with it.</p>
<p>Historical Research Methods</p>
<p>Only history, because the past is all past, there is of course no way to observe it. There are not many ancient relics left to the present, and they cannot be regarded as the entire reference. Therefore, we can only rely on the records of the ancients to be our basis. Therefore, this science of history cannot be regarded as a pure science. However, there is another modern method of studying history, which is the textual research method of historical materials that our people say. The so-called historical materials include relics and written records as the main components. There are two most important principles for textual research of historical materials. First, the most historical materials are required to be as complete as possible, so-called complete without omission. Second, the truth obtained in the most extensive historical materials, or the truth sought without an objective attitude, is not the scientific truth in history, and we must absolutely not trust it. Therefore, we must both demand the most extensive historical materials and use the most objective attitude to conduct textual research on them to seek the truth. The work of textual research of historical materials can be divided into two steps. The first step is to conduct textual research on whether the author of the historical materials is an honest, trustworthy, cautious, and unbiased person. This is the so-called effort of "knowing the world and knowing the person." The second step is to conduct textual research on whether this historical material is an original or a fake made by later generations. This is the so-called effort of "textual research of authenticity." Every historical material must go through this effort. Only when the author of the historical material and the historical material itself are reliable can we trust him and regard the situation he recorded as the truth of a certain ancient person or a certain major event. This kind of textual research effort is the most important step in studying history. Because of time constraints, we cannot talk more about it. If you are interested, please read my book "Historical Research Methods," which can give you a general idea. And about how we apply the method of induction to synthesize the facts recorded in the historical materials to seek the truth, and how we apply the method of deduction to infer the general outline of the truth from the facts recorded in a part of the historical materials, I think this is something that everyone who understands the art of thinking and textual research already knows, so I don't need to go into detail. Third, in the scientific method, there is also the so-called experiment, which cannot be applied in history, because the people and events of the past cannot be revived and reappear for us to experiment on again and again. In geography, we can only apply the method of verification to confirm the observations of others, but it is much more convenient and accurate than history.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In short, if we want to understand the past and present culture of mankind, we should study a little history and geography. When we study history and geography, we should maintain an objective attitude and make full use of scientific methods to seek the truth of various lives and activities of mankind in culture. We must never reverse right and wrong, nor can we turn falsehood into truth. We must write straight and tell the truth without concealing anything. This is perhaps the lesson that the study of history and geography gives us. The end.</p>

<p>The Literacy Education Committee of this city convened a publicity meeting at the Party Headquarters meeting room at 2:00 PM yesterday, inviting representatives from all walks of life to discuss the implementation methods and decided to hold a Literacy Publicity Week starting on May 1. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Attending Representatives: The total number of attendees included the director-general of the committee, Tao Baichuan, deputy director-general Jiang Jianbai, Huang Xianggu from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Zhang Yuanruo from the Municipal Government, Lv Hailan and Li Wanyu from the Municipal Education Bureau, Li Kuai and Li Guangteng from the Municipal Education Association, Zhu Zumo from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Yu Zhenhui from the Municipal Farmers' Association, Shao Xubai from the General Labor Union, Lin Kecong from the Women's Association, Wang Wanbai from the Wireless Broadcasting Association, Wei Yuqing and Zhou Yinfan from Guangyu Society, Chen Binru from Runyu Society, etc. Tao Baichuan presided over the meeting, and Lu Haishan recorded the proceedings. After the rituals, the chairman first reported, and then the publicity plan was passed as follows.</p>
<p>Publicity Goals: (1) To make the public aware that the literacy education movement being promoted by this committee is not a simple literacy education, but a national salvation movement that combines literacy education, common sense guidance, and civic training; (2) To make the public aware that the methods of promoting literacy education by this committee are divided into two types: one is remedial classes in schools, and the other is remedial classes outside schools. Under the first method, this committee will establish hundreds of literacy schools starting on July 1, forcing out-of-school people to go to school in batches for one hour a day, for a period of two months. Under the second method, this committee has requested the Shanghai Party and government agencies to stipulate by order that all Party members, civil servants, and school teachers and students have the obligation to teach people to read. Out-of-school people who have real difficulties in attending school are allowed to find their own teachers, or the committee will introduce the above-mentioned personnel to serve as teachers, receive textbooks, and study at home, and wait for the committee to convene tests after a certain period of time; (3) To make the public aware that it is necessary to start with investigation to handle this literacy education, so this committee will dispatch a large number of investigators between May and June to conduct door-to-door investigations of out-of-school people, so that they can be taught according to their aptitude in the future; (4) To make the public aware that this literacy movement is not only important, but also difficult, and compounded by the fact that this committee has few personnel and limited capabilities, it cannot be done without the assistance of all sectors of society. If they can widely publicize it verbally and give good guidance, the committee is already very grateful; (5) To create a warm and strong reading atmosphere, at least to make the public aware that this city is about to force out-of-school people to receive literacy education.</p>
<p>Publicity Plan: The ten experimental schools of this committee's Jiangwan District are scheduled to open on May 1, and the twenty-two district offices are also scheduled to be officially established on this day. The investigation of out-of-school people in various districts is scheduled to begin on the 8th, so these seven days are designated as Publicity Week, and their order is as follows: (1) Industry Publicity Day: (A) Hold the opening ceremony of the Shanghai Literacy Movement Week, and at the same time, the district offices are established, and the inauguration ceremony of the district directors and chairmen of the district investigation committees is held jointly; (B) This day happens to be May 1st Labor Day, it is planned to contact the General Labor Union to expand publicity, so that workers know the meaning of the May 1st Festival, in fighting for the three-eight system, and the three-eight system has eight hours of education in addition to eight hours of work and eight hours of rest; (C) The Jiangwan experimental schools hold an opening ceremony; (D) Major daily newspapers and tabloids each write a literacy education commentary; (E) Major daily newspapers compile and print a half-page special edition on the literacy movement, and the materials are provided by the committee; (F) Please add this committee's specially made slides to be shown in each movie theater for seven consecutive days; (2) Radio Publicity Day: (A) Urge popular education experts to give radio lectures; (B) Mobilize all radio stations' broadcasting and entertainment personnel to compile and broadcast literacy movement materials; (C) The committee compiles a simple description of the literacy movement and asks each radio station to report it; (3) Business Publicity Day: (A) Ask the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to issue a letter to merchants for the literacy movement; (B) Ask the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to notify each store to post slogans uniformly; (4) Entertainment Publicity Day: (A) Mobilize the entertainment personnel of all stages and entertainment venues, whether it is duets, storytelling, acrobatics, etc., please intersperse literacy movement materials; (B) This committee holds a costume lecture in Nanshi; (C) This committee sends personnel to each stage to give lectures; (D) Go to each entertainment venue to distribute leaflets and post slogans; (5) Film Publicity Day: (A) Contact the Film Education Association to choose a location to show educational films; (B) Select films with rich literacy education significance to screen at a chosen location on this morning, and invite the general public who are illiterate to watch for free; (6) Academic Publicity Day: (A) This day happens to be Monday, please ask the school authorities to lecture on the promotion of literacy education during the weekly memorial service; (B) Print leaflets with pictures and ask elementary and middle school students to take them home and persuade out-of-school people to read; (C) Please ask the Education Bureau to issue a notice to each school to organize publicity teams as appropriate and go out to promote publicity during after-school hours; (7) Agricultural Publicity Day: (A) This committee's twenty-two district offices, together with the district farmers' associations, widely promote publicity in rural areas; (B) Please ask the Municipal Farmers' Association to issue a letter to farmers for the literacy movement; (C) Airplanes go to the countryside to distribute leaflets.</p>

<h3 id="e197">How to Be a "Scientific Child"? <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Peng</p>
<p>Children! We must know that the world today is a scientific world. Within this scientific world, there must be a "scientific China." Who will create this scientific China? We, the children of today! But how do we become "scientific children"?</p>
<p>Hand-Brain Alliance: Science emerges from playing with tricks. These scientific tricks cannot be played blindly. If you only know how to play and don't think, then you're only fit to be a lackey under the "King of Tricks," not a "scientific child." Don't forget these two readily available VIPs: "Hands and Brain." You must ask the brain to be the commander-in-chief and the hands to be ten little soldiers. Everyone must form an alliance and attack all the mysteries in the universe.</p>
<p>Two Detectives: You can't attack nature without detectives. Children! Can you guess who they are? One is called the eye, and the other is called the ear. Your eyes are originally bright, so why are you wearing tinted glasses? Take off the tinted glasses, and they become your all-seeing eyes. Your ears are originally able to hear clearly, so why are you wearing superstitious earmuffs? Take them off, and they become your all-hearing ears. With all-seeing eyes and all-hearing ears as detectives, your commander-in-chief, two generals, and ten little soldiers will be able to know yourself and know your enemy, and win every battle.</p>
<p>Living Military Books: Fighting requires military books, otherwise you'll have courage without strategy. But these are living books—wind, rain, clouds, snow, sun, moon, stars, and all the transformations in the universe. These are all living books. When the sky thunders, you must ask, "What is the reason for that?" During solar and lunar eclipses, your two detectives must not be fooled. If they say, "A lunar eclipse is a wild moon eating a domestic moon," would you believe it? Ah! To seek true knowledge, you must first unravel all such mysteries in the natural world, and use these living books on this great battlefield.</p>

<p>— Sun Yucai, Xu Zhengji</p>
<p>(1) Painting Reeds to Teach Her Son</p>
<p>During the Song Dynasty, there was a scholar named Ouyang Xiu. When he was only four years old, his father died. At that time, the family was very poor. His mother, Zheng, couldn't afford paper and ink, so she used reeds (a type of rush) to draw on the ground to teach him how to read and write.</p>
<p>Through his mother's teaching, Ouyang Xiu's intelligence was greatly developed, and he gradually achieved considerable success in his studies.</p>
<p>Later, under the guidance of a good teacher, he passed the imperial examination and became an official. He indeed made some contributions during the Song Dynasty and was later known as Layman of the Sixth One. He wrote many books, including the New Book of Tang and the New History of the Five Dynasties, which are very famous.</p>
<p>Zong Que's Childhood Ambition</p>
<p>When Zong Que was very young, he was able to study hard. One day, his uncle, Shao Wen, called him over and asked, "What is your ambition for the future?" Zong Que said, "My ambition for the future is to ride the long winds and break through the waves for thousands of miles!" His uncle was very impressed. Later, Zong Que indeed became a famous general of his time, received the order to conquer Lin Yi, and was granted the title of Marquis of Taoyang.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Watering Flowers and Eating <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Da Zhai</p>
<p>Since I was young, I have liked flowers, and I especially like growing them myself. Although it takes some effort to cultivate them, I didn't understand the proper watering methods at first. I thought that to love flowers, I had to water them more often, the more times I watered them each day, the better. Little did I know that it was counterproductive, doing more harm than good. The flowers that were overwatered became weak. Later, I learned that watering flowers must be done at set times and according to standards.</p>
<p>Flowers absorb water for nourishment, and people's nourishment comes from eating. People's eating is just like watering flowers: it must be done at set times and according to standards. If you eat snacks excessively outside of mealtimes, it will invisibly damage your spleen and stomach, harm your nutrition, and hinder your health, just as the saying goes, "Eating without benefiting." I see some children—especially those from families with ample means—who eat a lot of snacks before lunch. When it's time for lunch, even though there are delicious dishes laid out, they don't seem appetizing to them. They can only eat a few bites before putting down their chopsticks. The mothers, who don't understand the reason and are overly doting, always say, "This child is so strange! How can he not eat when there are such good dishes?" In fact, they are too full from snacking before meals. Being full leads to a dislike of meals. It's not that the dishes don't taste good or that the appetite is too small. As the ancients said, "Strive to eat more rice." If you can't strive to eat rice, then you will naturally lack nutrition, resulting in thin muscles or even a pale complexion. This bad habit greatly affects your physique. You should know that building up your physique is very important, just like how well-nourished flowers will naturally flourish!</p>

<h3 id="e201">Flying Kites Can Release Internal Heat <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Xing Xia</p>
<p>All lively children love to fly kites in the spring. This is because it's a manifestation of the season, because they have beautiful colors and soaring postures, and because they can induce natural movement. At the same time, it can also provide a change of fresh air. This highly beneficial entertainment is truly of great benefit to children. It is said that, in addition to the above benefits, it can also allow children to release internal heat. As stated in the "Supplement to the Record of Diverse Matters," "Today's kites are raised by strings, causing children to open their mouths and look up, in order to release internal heat." This saying is quite correct. Originally, those suffering from eye diseases and poor health signs (such as eye problems, choking coughs, fever...) are due to having too much internal heat in the spring compared to the other three seasons. That is, "spring has more internal heat." Now, unknowingly releasing internal heat by playing with kites is certainly extremely good. However, again, there's something else to remember. While releasing internal heat is certainly a benefit of kites, children who love to play with kites must also remember one thing: always fly kites with your back to the wind and looking up. If you must open your mouth and look up as mentioned above, be sure to do so in a place with fresh air. Do not run against the wind to avoid stomach wind and causing much concern for your parents.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Owl <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Yuyang</p>
<p>Children! I'll teach you how to make an owl toy. It's a very fun toy. First, prepare the following materials (as shown in the picture): one nail, two bamboo sticks, three round pieces of paper, four, five, and six pieces of wood, seven pine cones and half a pine cone. The size of each material should be based on the pine cone as the standard. After you have prepared all the materials, first hammer the nail in the middle of the wood, as in (Figure 1). Then nail the four, five, and six pieces of wood together to form a T-shape, as in (Figure 2). Draw a pair of eyes on the two pieces of paper, as in (Figure 3). Stick them on top of the half pine cone. Insert a bamboo stick below the eyes to make a mouth. Then insert two bamboo sticks at the end of the pine cone to make feet. Put the half pine cone on top, and you have an owl toy!</p>

<p>— Lin Yin</p>
<p>When I talk about fish with children, everyone is excited and will answer, "I love to eat fish!" Many children have also told me that they have seen many kinds of fish. Friends have also written about fish in this magazine. Here, I want to tell children about some interesting aspects of fish life.</p>
<p>Look at the cuttlefish (Figure 1). It has an ink sac in its belly that can produce ink. When it encounters an animal that harms it, it releases ink to make the enemy unable to see it, allowing it to escape. Similar in shape to the cuttlefish is the octopus (Figure 2). It loves beauty and often changes its clothes. It often changes its color according to the weather and the rising and falling of the sun and moon. Sometimes it's pale yellow, sometimes it's moon white, sometimes it's mud gray, and sometimes it's grass green. Think about it, how fun is that! (Figure 3) shows the starfish. It has a special ability. When its body splits, it can still continue its life. If you tear it into fragments and throw it back into the water, after a certain period of time, the torn parts will grow back as before and turn into several starfish. However, if it is torn apart for more than fifteen minutes, its life cannot be sustained. The seahorse (Figure 4) is born very special, and its swimming method is also completely different from other fish. Its head looks like a horse's head, its eyes protrude outward, and it swims with its body upright. Its tail looks like a cat's tail. When the waves crash, it hooks its tail onto rocks or seaweed to avoid danger. (Figure 5) is the croaker. Its pectoral fins are particularly large, like two wings. It has a special skill, which is that it can sing and bark. This is because its swim bladder is very thick. When the two swim bladders touch, contracting and expanding, a "gululi gululi" sound is produced. The sunfish (Figure 6) has a very large body, more than two zhang long and more than 1,500 pounds heavy, like a large chicken heart. Its tail is very powerful, and its strength is also very great. Sea ships are often overturned by it. Because small animals in the sea are afraid of it and avoid it, it often uses the method of pretending to be dead to catch other fish for food.</p>
<p>Children! The lives of fish in the sea are very interesting. You can study them more. These are just a few very common ones.</p>

<p>— Feng</p>
<p>I know that when children see a title like mine, they will definitely think it's a hoax. How can a paper fish live? That's right, a paper fish certainly can't live. However, there is a way to make a paper fish flip back and forth, looking as if it's moving like a living fish. Think about it: how interesting would this gadget be!</p>
<p>The method is very easy. Just take a small strip of transparent paper (like glass) and cut it into the shape of a fish according to the attached diagram.</p>
<p>When playing, use half a cup of very hot tea or boiling water. Cover the cup with a piece of paper to prevent the heat from escaping. Then place the fish on the paper, and the paper fish will move continuously.</p>

<p>Use transparent paper to cut in this way. Place the paper on the bowl, and put the fish on the paper.</p>
<h3 id="e208">The Voyages of Sinbad the Sailor (14) <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>One day the king summoned me. When I arrived before him, he said, "Sinbad, I love you. In my heart, I think you should take a wife and live here, and no longer think about your own homeland."</p>
<p>Naturally, I had to do as the king said, so he gave me a wealthy woman from the court as my wife.</p>
<p>I lived in this place for a long time, but although I had great wealth and a noble wife, my life could never make me happy. My great desire was to return once, to see my relatives and friends in the city of Baghdad. My heart was filled with plans on how to see them.</p>
<p>While I was thinking this way, a friend of mine came to see me in great sorrow, because his wife had just died.</p>
<p>I told him that I had heard of his loss and was very upset.</p>
<p>I said, "May God grant you long life."</p>
<p>He said, "Stop! How can you think that I can live long? I don't have many days to live."</p>
<p>I told him not to look at things so pessimistically, and I hoped that he could live for many more years.</p>
<p>Then he told me that there was a strange thing to tell me. I learned from him about the law of this place: when a man dies, his wife must be placed in the grave with him. If a wife dies, her husband must also enter the grave with her body, taking only a jug of water and a few small loaves of bread with him.</p>
<p>When I heard this, I was filled with terror. So I went to ask the king whether this law might apply to me, since I was not born in this place if my wife died. The king told me that when my wife died, I would have to be treated the same way as my poor friend.</p>
<p>He said, "Sinbad, everyone who lives in this place must be treated the same. Even if I am the king, if my queen dies first, I must go with her. So why shouldn't you?"</p>
<p>The day came when my friend's deceased wife was buried in the grave. She was wearing her best clothes and adorned with precious jewels. They carried her body to the top of a high mountain. There was a deep mine shaft there, with a large stone covering the opening.</p>
<p>They lowered the body down, and then my poor friend was lowered down, as I had heard before, with a bottle of water and small loaves of bread. Then the large stone was placed back over the mine opening, and my friend was left with his deceased wife.</p>
<p>From then on, I did nothing but guard my wife. If she suffered from even a minor illness, I was filled with terror. Eventually, my terror came true, and she died from an illness.</p>

<p>Yesterday, although the foreign exchange market was during the foreign merchants' holiday period, it was also the beginning of the final settlement period for the end of April, so the situation was unusually firm. The foreign exchange interbank rate was still one dime in both the morning and afternoon. The interest rate for short-term loans was the same as the previous day, initially two cents, then changed to three cents. It is heard that new long-term loans from the banking and money-changing sectors amounted to about one million. On the income side, transfers still accounted for the majority. Regarding clearing transactions, transfers totaled over 3.1 million in the morning market, with over 500,000 in new transactions. In the afternoon market, transactions amounted to over 200,000. Transactions in the small general meeting totaled over 400,000. Redemption of foreign collateral loans amounted to over 400,000, with over 500,000 in new loans. Regarding currency warrant transactions, over 900,000 were recovered, with 600,000 in circulating notes and 500,000 in marked notes issued. Remittances from various routes amounted to over 300,000, revenue from passenger routes amounted to 300,000, and expenses amounted to 200,000. Regarding bank collections, foreign banks were still closed for the holiday, with only Chinese banks collecting over 1.6 million in bills. Collections of various freight, exchange, pawn, tax, and miscellaneous items totaled over 2.6 million, with 300,000 withdrawn from warehouses. Collections of money shop foreign public bills amounted to over 29 million, collections of foreign short-term loans amounted to over 1.8 million, and cash collections amounted to 300,000.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small silver dollars were still 836 yuan in the morning and afternoon, the same as the previous day. Transactions were only made in the morning market at 3,000 dimes. There was no news in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver dollars initially rose by four cents in the morning market to 734 yuan and three cents. The afternoon market continued to improve by five cents, changing to 734 yuan and eight cents. As a result, it rose by nine cents compared to the previous day. Transactions were made in the morning market at 220,000 dimes and in the afternoon market at 90,000 dimes. Copper cash was slightly lower by 500 cash compared to the previous day, at 335,500 cash. The transaction volume was 41,937 strings and 500 cash, equivalent to 12,500 yuan in silver dollars. Furthermore, the total number of exchanges at the city's clearing house was 8,643,600 yuan and 0.048 cents in silver dollars, including 2,942,131 yuan and 0.86 cents in silver dollars and 5,701,468 yuan and 0.62 cents in exchange transfers.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Securities: Government Bonds Hovered and Strengthened; The 96 Series Uniquely Fell Due to Rumors of Old Notes Being Universally Accepted <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Securities Exchange, prices hovered and strengthened, with no major fluctuations. Although the number of margin accounts was large, both long and short positions were holding steady as before. There were only two days left in this month's futures, and the market showed no signs of infighting. Swap transactions were also not lively. The dull situation was still unable to be broken. The rumors regarding the 96 series of government bonds had not subsided. It was said that old notes could be universally accepted like new notes. Upon investigation, the total number of old notes that had lost their validity and had not been exchanged for new notes was less than 10 million, which could not be circulated in the market. Their black market price was mostly only around four yuan. At this time, it suddenly jumped to the same price as the market price listed on the market, more than one and a half times higher than the original value. As a result, the spot market was crowded, and there was a sudden outflow, and the market price showed signs of collapse. What was rumored like this was probably not true. However, according to common sense, since consolidation was impossible, there was no reason why old notes would suddenly receive preferential treatment alone. Yesterday's progress was stable and firm, with nothing much to be said in terms of honor or disgrace. The morning was still uncertain, and the afternoon was relatively firm. There were very few transactions by large investors, but the newly listed No. 72 was quite popular. The 96 series of government bonds, Nos. 47, 48, and 53, etc., were sold very actively, while No. 11 was already covering short positions. The situation was chaotic and more ominous than auspicious. According to the results of the market prices, except for the 96 series, which fell by five cents to two and a half cents, the rest consistently rose by five cents to two and a half cents. The total transaction volume was 11,142,500 yuan, of which the 96 series accounted for 4,585,000 yuan. The results of the gains and losses are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>The yarn market is lackluster and showing signs of softening. Most people have low expectations for the yarn auctions, and there are many sellers. However, according to some sources, although new goods are being delivered this month, certain parties are still buying as usual, so prices remain high. Da Kee has also purchased over three thousand bales.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Slightly Softens</p>
<p>The opening of the spot yarn market continued the good performance of this month. However, distant months mostly tended towards short selling, and the market felt looser. General short sellers argued that spot yarn sales were weak and that Japanese yarn was being sold competitively everywhere, predicting that the future yarn market would be hit hard. Everyone sold off, but Da Kee heavily covered their shorts, buying over one thousand bales. As a result, this month's closing price was unchanged from the previous day, with distant months falling by 0.2 to 0.3 taels. The afternoon opening saw a scattered market and a weakening trend. It was heard that the spot yarn market was sluggish, and Rui Da and Xin Cheng were selling step by step. Unexpectedly, Da Kee continued to buy in the afternoon, with a large volume of 2,050 bales. Including both morning and afternoon sessions, a total of 3,100 bales were purchased, allowing the market to maintain its level. As a result, this month's closing price fell by 0.2 taels from the morning closing price, with distant months dropping by 0.1 tael. Rui Da sold 1,000 bales, Xin Cheng sold 1,900 bales, Yong Da sold 400 bales, Tong He sold 400 bales, Da Fu sold 400 bales, Yu Da sold 300 bales, He Yu sold 300 bales, Run Kang sold 300 bales, and Zhen Da sold 350 bales. Da Kee bought 3,100 bales, Da Feng bought 600 bales, Ming De bought 500 bales, Geng Feng bought 450 bales, Heng De bought 750 bales, and Heng Chang bought 300 bales. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>

<p>Although several thousand dan of cotton were delivered this month, spot cotton merchants generally have a bullish outlook, and the market remains firm. However, forward months are under heavy pressure from consistent selling by banks and foreign firms, showing weakness.</p>
<p>This Month's Cotton Stands Firm</p>
<p>The opening of the spot cotton market saw all months decline, as there were rumors of several thousand dan being delivered by short sellers, causing market sentiment to weaken and selling pressure to increase slightly. However, some cotton merchants are not bearish for the time being, as spot cotton futures prices are still lower than spot cotton prices. As a result, all months fell by 0.1 to 0.15 taels from the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon, the current month opened, and some cotton firms bought in, causing the market to rebound slightly. However, selling in distant months increased, and short sellers added to their positions, causing the market to weaken. As a result, the current month rose by 0.15 taels from the morning closing price, while distant months fell by 0.05 to 0.1 taels. Geng Feng sold 1,700 dan, Shen Chang sold 800 dan, Shen Ji sold 1,000 dan, Ren Feng sold 1,400 dan, Yi Chang sold 1,200 dan, Chang Feng sold 1,100 dan, Xin Cheng sold 1,700 dan, and Xie Cheng sold 1,100 dan. Da Fu bought 1,200 dan, Da Feng bought 1,300 dan, Jin Chang bought 1,000 dan, Ming De bought 1,200 dan, He Xing bought 1,400 dan, Jun Chang bought 2,100 dan, Yong Da bought 1,000 dan, Yi Kang bought 2,200 dan, Chang He bought 1,800 dan, and Yuan Xing Chang bought 1,700 dan.

<h3 id="e215">Last Week's Rise in American Cotton Slightly Weakens <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>A telegram from New York on April 18th reports on the cotton market situation for the week: After rising this week, cotton prices turned downward, as it was felt that further price increases would inevitably lead to increased spot cotton sales. On Thursday, many long positions in the May contract, before the Jin Tong announcement of delivery, were liquidated. Continued reductions in domestic cotton mill output and uncertain news from Washington policies also contributed to the decline in cotton prices. When cotton prices fell, there were limited sales due to stop-loss orders. Subsequently, due to purchases by peers and short covering before the holiday, the market situation stabilized somewhat. The call for the abolition of handling fees still exists. Representatives of cotton goods manufacturers in Beijing will meet with President Luo in the coming days to discuss everything. Cotton belt planting is proceeding slowly in the west but well in the south. Most reports still indicate that farmers are fully cooperating with the acreage reduction program. The buying momentum in the cotton goods market is gradually decreasing, but sales in the past half-month have been in line with recent production.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Grains: Sunny Weather Causes Flour and Wheat to Fall - Many Floating Positions Exit, Sellers Continue <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>After the flour market opened in the morning, all months fell uniformly. With foreign wheat suspended and no price available, when prices opened, the sky cleared up, and the bright sunshine softened the hearts of people inside and outside the industry. In addition, various factories were selling enthusiastically, and many floating positions were exiting, temporarily shorting. Therefore, near and far months showed an extremely tired and unbearable decline, falling by 0.02 to 0.04 taels compared to the closing price of the previous day. The current month was also difficult to hold up due to customer sell-offs. When the market opened in the afternoon, the weather was again cloudy and clear, and the climate was cold, fearing continued rain, so people's hearts recovered slightly, improving by about 0.01 taels compared to the morning. Later, the sunshine slightly increased, and the market atmosphere became more peaceful. The current rise and fall are greatly related to the weather, so there is very little certainty in buying and selling. As a result, the current month fell by 0.02 taels, May fell by 0.0175 taels, June fell by 0.0275 taels, July fell by 0.0225 taels, August fell by 0.0175 taels, and September fell by 0.0275 taels.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning, various months showed near-term stability and distant-term declines. As the current month will soon be delivered, there is not much spot wheat on the market, and few foreign wheat deliveries are being made, so opening prices remain firm. As for the deferred months, although there is no quotation for foreign wheat, the weather has cleared up, and people's hearts have inevitably loosened. Floating positions are exiting, and sellers are connected one after another, so they fell by 0.05 to 0.06 taels. When the market opened in the afternoon, trading was still brisk, but with dense clouds and the intention of continued rain, the market atmosphere stabilized. As a result, the current month was unchanged, July fell by 0.04 taels, August fell by 0.03 taels, and September fell by 0.05 taels. Spot wheat prices are good, with first-grade goods up 0.01 to 0.02 taels, and middle-grade goods also stable. Opening prices for Shandong white wheat and Yingzhou wheat are 4.012 taels, Bengbu wheat 4 taels, Liuhe wheat 3.95 taels, and Jiangbei wheat 3.95 taels. A total of 4,000 bales were handled by Fufeng.</p>

<p>The foreign indica rice market remains active, especially with strong demand from inland areas. Yesterday, the entire city opened with 20,000 bales of foreign rice, most of which were handled by inland areas. However, sales in this street have weakened, and the Yangtze River group has not inquired. Only inland single gangs are active, so the transaction volume is less than half of the previous day's. High-quality foreign rice is flat and soft, but mid-range rice is still able to stand firm due to brisk inland sales. Foreign indica rice lacks a stable market. Yesterday, the inland areas of this street all actively handled brown indica rice, opening 1,800 bales throughout the day. The market sentiment shows signs of optimism.</p>
<p>Yesterday (south of Shanghai), the sources of local rice from various gangs suddenly turned active, with over 40 numbers arriving (a total of over 8,000 shih). After the sales yard was idle the day before yesterday, even more goods arrived yesterday, causing people's hearts to be discouraged. The appetite in this street is becoming more and more sluggish, resulting in oversupply. The reverse wind is fiercely downstream. If the prices of various thick japonica rice fall by 0.2 to 0.3 taels, although late-season rice continues to be booked, the Qingdao gang handled over 1,000 bales, but in the end, the overall trend was soft. Furthermore, because the previous price levels were too high, the price decline was even more severe, reaching 0.3 to 0.4 taels. Yin Yuan and others were also unable to stand firm at this point, and they all saw a devaluation of more than two chih, only the variant Yuan was not very glorious due to the scarcity of goods. (North of Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 20 boats arrived from various gangs downstream, but the sales of various goods in the market were scarce. The market price of white japonica and early thin rice white Yuan price was slightly down 0.1 to 0.2 taels, and other goods also saw adjustments.</p>

<p>In recent days, the wheat bran market has turned to stability, as the decline has reached a substantial 0.2 to 0.3 taels since the previous week. Due to cost factors, factories are thinking about holding up and not opening, so people's hearts have turned slightly positive. Various grades are bidding at 2.38 taels, which is slightly better than before. However, inventories are reportedly abundant. If foreign Zhuang remains unchanged, it should be a stable market.</p>

<p>Hangzhou is the concentration area for tea businesses. Recently, Longjing tea from Lion Peak and various pre-Qingming roasted green teas have been listed in large quantities. However, this year, tea customers from the north are scarce, and the Shanghai and Hangzhou gangs are also not very active in their purchases due to tight credit. Therefore, the market lacks progress.</p>
<p>According to news received yesterday in Shanghai from tea producing areas such as Zhuji and Xiaoshan, new tea has already been listed in that area. Many Shanghai local Zhuang tea factories have sent personnel to gather there. It is heard that the first grade rough tea has already opened at a new price of 45 yuan, which is not much different from last year.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market recovered and firmed due to renewed rumors of a tax increase. The association marked the price of No. 24 Dutch coarse white sugar at 17.3 taels, up 0.05 taels, and transit goods at 5.6 taels, up 0.1 taels. Later, they were unwilling to offer any more, expecting continued tightness. Taikoo sugar and this factory's refined white sugar were traded at the original price slightly. Only the Chao gang opened a number of over one hundred bales of Zhiyang at a price of 12.9 to 13.1 taels. The first batch of genuine refined red sugar has arrived slightly. Yesterday, only 10 bales were offered at a price of 12.3 taels.</p>

<p>Recently, the price of white lotus in Lanxi has decreased, and sales in Shanghai are also scarce, so the market is very weak. The trading price has fallen to 38-39 yuan, a decrease of more than 10 yuan compared to the highest price before.

<p>Since the arrival of 90-pound American new iron after the New Year, there have been no more spot goods shipped in. Recently, due to the increasing scarcity of goods and the increasing demand, the market trend is very good. The market price is increasing step by step due to the trend of the environment, estimated at 16 yuan per box, an increase of more than 0.5 taels compared to before. The transaction volume reached a large amount of 400 to 500 boxes, but there are still many recent additions. Unfortunately, there is a general lack of goods for sale on the market.

The current price is estimated at 7.23 taels, a decrease of 0.2 to 0.3 taels compared to before. It is heard that the enamel factories and thermos factories are currently experiencing declining business, resulting in less demand. Therefore, the trend is unlikely to improve in the short term.</p>

<h3 id="e224">Women's Suicide <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Jiu</p>
<p>The bright spring scenery is both tempting and annoying. Leisurely people can certainly take advantage of this beautiful weather to travel and dance all day and night, adding some festive scenery to this bright spring scenery. However, in this harmonious atmosphere, there are many unharmonious tunes that can be seen everywhere in the texts that convey messages. Opening the newspaper every day, I feel that the word "kill" is particularly active in the news after the spring, with a scene of murderous aura rushing to the sky. Now, let's put aside the various "being killed" events and focus on studying suicide.</p>
<p>On the 11th of this month, the Zhonghua Daily published a statistic of the number of suicides in major cities across the country in March. (See the suicide statistics table below) Two characteristics can be found from that statistics table. First: the number of suicides in metropolitan cities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Hangzhou is more men than women! Conversely. In more remote cities. Such as Kunming. Kaifeng. Wuchang, etc. there are more women than men. Second: the reasons for suicide, for women, are mostly family disputes, with a total of 308 people in March, accounting for the largest number. Men are mostly due to livelihood difficulties.</p>
<p>The above two characteristics are linked. The reason for this, when analyzed in detail, is mostly as follows: In more remote cities, feudal forces must still be stronger than in metropolitan cities. The large family system still exists. Old and young live together. New and old mix. Here, there are inevitable conflicts in ideology, disharmony in life, and economic conflicts of interest, coupled with the teachings of the three obediences and four virtues. It is still the natural law of the head of the family and the neighbors. These can make a weak person—an oppressed person—take the road to death. In recent years, the countryside has fallen into bankruptcy: remote cities are also on the verge of decline. Nineteen out of ten men leave home, abandon their wives, and rush to other trading ports. In this annoying spring scenery, the young women in the family may be amorous, and the young widows may occasionally reveal spring feelings, which are also common in the nature of things. However, feudal society firmly locks women with the chains of chastity. If there is any damage to this chain, they will inevitably suffer the stigma of being immoral. They can neither settle under the chains nor be traitors under the feudal forces—anti-feudal traitors. The only way to end it is through suicide. Three wives and four concubines living together in one family was not a big deal in the old society. In this struggle for favor and the husband, the defeated have no way to survive, so they can only die. Early marriage has become a habit, and girls over thirty who have not yet had good news are already qualified to be old maids. If they cannot be independent, they will surely suffer double misery! Sexual misery and life misery. Sexual repression often leads to "hysteria or nervous disorders, and the above-mentioned diseases are the root cause of family disputes.</p>
<p>In addition, among the reasons for suicide in this statistics table, the two items of lack of freedom in marriage and unrequited love are also more women than men, so on the surface, women's suicides mostly die in the family and die in love. It seems that women's minds are particularly narrow, and only small family disputes will lead to suicide. It seems that women are particularly amorous, and they do not hesitate to sacrifice their lives for love. In fact, women in feudal society, her world is only the family, and the family is her prison. She commits crimes in prison. If she does not commit suicide, she can only escape from this prison, but this is something that only the extremely strong can do. As for ordinary new women, they mostly go into the dead end of "love supremacy." Love is her only life. If she fails, she can only die to end it. The plot of this kind of tragedy of dying in the family and dying in love is certainly very complicated, but in the final analysis, it is nothing more than feudal forces and economic problems. There are not many men who die in family disputes and love, due to the former's tolerance. Therefore, only economic problems make men commit suicide.</p>
<p>As for the major cities, the number of women who commit suicide is less than that of men. The reason is that the trading ports have at least been slightly washed by capitalism, and the feudal forces have become relatively weak. Therefore, as long as the economic situation of women in the upper and middle classes is not a problem, social interaction is relatively free. However, women trapped by the economy still do not enjoy that kind of welfare. Therefore, the number of suicides among women in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, and other places is relatively less than that of men. But the number is still not in the minority.</p>
<p>In short, feudal forces are eating people, and a society covered in a thin veil of capitalism is also eating people, but feudal forces eat more women than men!</p>

<h3 id="e225">Lecture 5: Women in Medieval Feudal Society Section 1: The Feudal System and the Clan System <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Hui</p>
<p>To correctly understand the status of women in medieval (4th-15th century) feudal society, we must first understand the economic production relations and social systems of this society, especially the clan system.</p>
<p>First, we need to know how the ancient slave labor system mentioned in the previous lecture transformed into the feudal serfdom system, and how this transformation affected women.</p>
<p>The ancient society that created a solemn and brilliant civilization, with the highly developed Roman Empire as its final stage, finally collapsed in the fourth and fifth centuries AD. The main reasons were:</p>
<p>First, the production technology of slave labor was limited by the private property system and could not develop.</p>
<p>Second, under the oppression of slave labor production, free farmers and handicraftsmen were on the verge of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Third, under unlimited exploitation, the mortality rate of slaves increased sharply, the birth rate decreased sharply, the price of slaves soared, and the source of slaves dried up.</p>
<p>Fourth, slave rebellions arose one after another, and the decadent free people were unable to maintain social order.</p>
<p>In this way, the slave system, which had once promoted the development of social productive forces, became a shackle hindering the development of productive forces. Therefore, the new social form that broke its shackles from the womb of this old society and hatched out was the medieval feudal serfdom society.</p>
<p>Serfdom society and slave society are essentially the same thing. Serfs were composed of freed slaves, bankrupt free people, and people from conquered regions. The main producer in feudal society differed from slaves in that slaves were directly subordinate to the master, while serfs were subordinate to the land owned by the master. Therefore, the serf system can be said to be a mitigated slave system! It can also be said to be an intermediate form between slaves and modern laborers.</p>
<p>The characteristic of the feudal social system is that conquered land was entirely owned by the great lords (kings), who then divided the land outside their directly governed areas into fiefdoms or territories and distributed them to lesser lords (vassals). Lesser lords then divided them among their retainers (staff), and the retainers further divided them among the serfs. In this way, there was an absolute relationship of command between great lords, lesser lords, retainers, and serfs, with military service as the main obligation. Serfs were engaged in agriculture, and in their total production, they contributed everything except the minimum necessary living materials to the lord, and had no right to move or choose a profession. They were bought and sold together with the land, and losing the land meant losing their basis for survival. At that time, handicrafts and commerce were not very developed, and a closed natural economy dominated the entire social life.</p>
<p>The clan system built on this economic foundation was also characterized by absolute subordination. The relationship of wife to husband, children to parents, and family to the patriarch was the same as the relationship of serf to lord, all with absolute obedience. This relationship was rationalized and justified by institutions such as law, religion, morality, and education!</p>
<p>In the ancient slave labor era, women had already been driven into the home. In the feudal era, they were even more bound by various systems, completely losing their status as "people." For example, "Three Obediences and Four Virtues, Seven Reasons for Divorce" were typical moral codes that restricted women in general feudal countries. In particular, the feudal clan system placed women under the absolute control of male authority, making them lifelong slaves of men. As the saying goes, "Marry a chicken, follow a chicken; marry a dog, follow a dog," which is the most profound expression of the status and suffering of women in feudal society!</p>
<p>In the era of closed natural economy, the economic tasks of the family were very important. It was a cell of the social organism of the feudal state, a unit of economic production. The unity and consolidation of a family's property was a major condition for maintaining the feudal state. Therefore, in feudal society, the authority of the patriarch was particularly strengthened, and the entire family unconditionally obeyed the orders of the patriarch.</p>
<p>Feudal law, in order to preserve the family property passed down from generation to generation, adopted the system of primogeniture. According to this system, the inheritance after the death of the patriarch could be inherited by the patriarch's eldest son. Therefore, the patriarch attached great importance to his eldest son. If the mistress did not give birth to a son, she would not only be subjected to abuse by the family, but also to discrimination by society. In some parts of Germany, the autonomous legal system stipulated that men who could not have sons should allow their wives to have relations with neighbors in order to have successors. The practice of wife-renting and concubinage in China was also mostly justified by the lack of sons.</p>
<p>The feudal state regarded the family as an independent entity, and made each individual absolutely subordinate to the family, and prevented all changes in the family. There were two reasons for this: first, to make the family the most effective economic cell for production, and second, to make the family reproduce and promote population growth.</p>
<p>The family forms of the feudal era cannot naturally be observed with a unified concept! In this society, there were different class groups, such as lords, knights, handicraftsmen, merchants, and farmers, each with different social lives, and their family relationships also differed. I would like, in this lecture, to observe the status of women in feudal society from the economic activities of each class, their social lives, and even their family and marriage forms.</p>

<h3 id="e226">The Painful Life of Rural Women in Jiangbei <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Fang</p>
<p>The lives of women in the counties of Jiangbei, if not for the continuous natural and man-made disasters, are usually quite bearable. However, in recent years, they have been living a hellish life that is unimaginable to women of the educated class!</p>
<p>Some rural women near the county seat, unable to withstand the oppression of this hellish life, run to the city to hire themselves out and live the life of slaves. The rural women in the Huai, Xu, Hai, and Yang areas mostly live in thatched houses with insufficient sunlight, dampness, and narrowness. The windows are also very small, and the furnishings of the house are very simple. If they are a little poorer, this thatched house serves many purposes. The stove and cooking utensils are piled in a corner of this thatched hut. Whenever cooking, black smoke fills the whole area like a thick fog, making it impossible to distinguish people's faces. Because the things burned in the countryside are mostly leaves, rice straw, wheat stalks, and bean stalks, which turn to ashes as soon as they catch fire. Cooking a meal requires burning a lot, and because the stove mouth must simultaneously emit smoke and accommodate those non-fire-resistant materials, cooking a meal almost suffocates people. In summer, it is even more unbearably hot, which is what they often say: "Entering in dry clothes, and coming out in wet clothes." From this, one can see the degree of heat. Sometimes, the things used for burning are piled up next to the stove. Behind the door, there is sometimes a chicken coop, which is specially prepared for the chickens to roost. Under the coop, there are piles of chicken droppings. Whenever it is cloudy and rainy, a strange smell wafts, making it difficult to breathe. Because they are used to it, they don't feel any pain. However, there are also chicken coops specially built in the courtyard for the chickens. In this small thatched house, besides their beds, some miscellaneous grains are also piled in a corner. When it rains, some firewood is also brought into the house. At this time, there is simply no place to stand in the house. How can one talk about cleanliness and hygiene? In the eyes of the villagers, everything that is waste is very precious. For example, the ashes from under the stove, the dirty water for washing pots and bowls, and excrement, etc., are all specially stored in a pit dug in the yard in preparation for spreading them on the fields next spring. Therefore, in summer, the air is full of foul odors, and it becomes the source of all infectious diseases. The breeding of mosquitoes is particularly severe. Malaria is particularly prevalent in Jiangbei. I think this is one of the reasons.</p>
<p>As for their sleep time, there is no fixed time. During the busy farming season, they may not sleep all night, or they may go to bed at midnight and get up at three or four in the morning the next day. Every year in April and May of the lunar calendar, it is the wheat harvesting season. Almost at three o'clock in the morning, they are busy going to the fields to work, and they don't drag their tired bodies back until late at night. If they have small children, they leave them at home without anyone to take care of them. When they are thirsty and hungry, they pick up whatever they can eat, and even dirty water becomes a very important food or drink for them. Some are busy boiling water and cooking, or carrying water to the fields for irrigation. They are really busy non-stop.</p>
<p>After harvesting the wheat, they can get some free time. At this time, they also use this free time to lead young girls to weave straw hat braids, handbags, baskets, and other utensils from wheat stalks and sell them in the city, in order to exchange a few coins to subsidize their families or as their own private savings, or use these coins to buy some new decorations. They are the most capable of using free time. No matter how painful it is, they find work to do as soon as they have a little time. After weaving straw hat braids, they are busy dismantling and washing old cotton clothes or quilts, or rushing to make shoes and socks for their husbands and children to use in the winter.</p>
<p>After all the crops are harvested, they are busy ginning cotton, spinning yarn, and weaving cloth to make clothes. So, if you go to the countryside in the counties of Jiangbei in winter, you will often hear the "Hmm! Hmm! Hmm!" sound of cotton fluffing, the "Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!" sound of spinning yarn, and the "Clatter! Clatter! Clatter!" sound of shuttles weaving back and forth late at night. Their diligence can be imagined from this!</p>
<p>As for the lamps they use for lighting, they are almost still the bean oil lamps or cottonseed oil lamps used in the 18th century. Occasionally kerosene lamps are used, but that is always a minority. Even if they use kerosene lamps, it is rare to see those with glass lamp shades. The diet is also very simple. They rarely have the opportunity to eat meat all year round. They mostly eat vegetables and coarse rice. After the new wheat is harvested, they have a little chance to eat some coarse wheat flour and some wild vegetables. Because they are reluctant to eat the vegetables in their gardens, they pick them to towns to exchange for grain to survive. As for some seasonings commonly used in our cities, such as oil, salt, sauce, and vinegar, they regard them as very precious. When seasoning dishes with sesame oil, they use a chopstick with a small coin with a hole tied to one end to dip into the oil jar and drip it into the dish. When eating normally, they almost always mash some garlic and chili peppers, or green onions, with some cold water, and that is enough to complete their meal. They rarely see meat, except during festive occasions, funerals, or New Year's celebrations, even the elderly are no exception. The water they usually drink is mostly plain boiled water. Occasionally, they soak some bamboo leaves or locust leaves in the water to change the color of the plain water. When they are busy, they drink some cold water to quench their thirst.</p>
<p>If you want to know whether a woman in Jiangbei's Xu, Huai, and Hai areas is a virtuous wife and good mother, it is easy to identify. You just need to look at their hair to see if it is combed into a bun, or if they have a very long braid. This is because the custom in the villages of Jiangbei's counties is that all married young women wear a bun at the back of their heads. Unmarried girls keep a very long braid behind their backs. Sometimes they cover their heads with a piece of blue cloth or a towel to avoid sunlight or dirt. They rarely wear flowers or hairpins on ordinary days, unless they are getting married or celebrating the New Year. Now the custom of foot-binding in Jiangbei is no longer very prevalent, and there are foot-releasing committees organized to prohibit foot-binding. If there are intentional violations, they will be punished by being paraded through the streets barefoot. This method is quite effective.</p>
<p>The rural women of Jiangbei pass by in such a constant stream of pain.</p>

<p>Throughout this magazine year, we have seen newspapers filled with magazine advertisements, and bookstores filled with sample copies of various magazines. The magazine year is indeed worthy of its name, but among the piles of magazines in this magazine year, there are very few women's publications with substantial content that truly benefit women. Recently, it has been heard that a group of female writers in Shanghai, in view of the needs of the times, will publish a monthly magazine entitled "Women's Life." The content will focus on the theory and practical issues of the modern women's movement, the living conditions of women at home and abroad, and various common sense lectures, striving to be suitable for the general public of women to read. The publisher will be "Shanghai Magazine Company," it is said.</p>

<p>— Zhang Jian</p>
<p>When we study problems, think, and even perceive phenomena, we cannot but have a standard to restrain and guide our thinking, so that our thinking can follow a certain path to compare and deduce other phenomena, and reach a thorough understanding of them. This standard comes from human history, the current society, or from the knowledge developed by the individual's continuous experience, becoming a more fundamental theoretical formula. This theoretical formula is usually called a principle.</p>
<p>People have no definite views on the applicability of such principles. Scholars who specialize in deductive reasoning regard principles as the only important thing, believing that as long as one starts from an established principle, anything can be deduced from it. All cosmic, social, and moral laws have a fundamental principle that is constant and unchanging, and subsequent developments are merely the manifestation of this fundamental principle in real things, becoming real forms. For example, things like truth, goodness, and beauty are pre-existing principles that transcend time and space. Truthful, good, and beautiful things are the same for humans today and humans in ancient times, on Earth and on other planets. Untruthful, ungood, and unbeautiful things cannot be regarded as truthful, good, and beautiful; nor can something be truthful, good, and beautiful at this time and space and not be so at another time and space. To understand things, we only need to obtain these fundamental and eternal principles, and we can use them to deduce everything, and we can completely guarantee that it is correct.</p>
<p>Scholars who specialize in inductive promotion, especially researchers who take the experience of real phenomena as the realm, generally despise principles. They believe that new things can only exist in new phenomena. Therefore, to obtain new knowledge, it is only possible to actually experience new single phenomena one by one. Because before experiencing them, one does not even know the new phenomena themselves, so how can one have a knowledge of them? Using known principles to deduce phenomena, no matter how you deduce them, you can only limit yourself to revolving around the principles themselves and cannot deduce new knowledge. Therefore, principles are unnecessary in research.</p>
<p>To understand whether principles are needed in research and the extent to which principles are applicable, we must first understand the relationship between things and the historical process of human knowledge, two important issues. In terms of the things in the universe, every thing, even the most special thing, is both individual and belongs to the whole, having both unique special qualities and the same kind of qualities as other things within certain limits. Therefore, there are laws that match itself, both its own special laws and its general laws. If the principle we obtain is the general law of the kind mentioned here, then it is obvious that this principle will be a range that cannot be surpassed by any single thing belonging to this general and kind. Since this is the case, then even if those single things have not yet entered our range of experience, this principle can still match it, and it is not absolutely impossible to deduce from this principle beyond the known limits, trying to obtain new things there. Moreover, our research and understanding absolutely cannot recognize the outside world without basing anything on any principle. For example, if we want to recognize that a horse is a mammal, we must at least base it on the initial principle that it feeds its young with milk to recognize that it is also a mammal, although this concept of a mammal is still induced from many facts of feeding its offspring with milk. The long-term accumulation of human knowledge and the gradual storage of experience, regardless of whether it is absolutely correct, is the principle that guides our understanding and research. If we say that our research does not need principles at all, then is historical knowledge not completely useless? However, in fact, if we leave it, it will not be easy for us to study everything.</p>
<p>However, the laws existing in objective things, even if we don't care whether they themselves are changing (in fact, they themselves also change with the change of things), are subject to various limitations in terms of human understanding of them, especially the stage of historical development and the limitations of social conditions. Therefore, the perfection of human knowledge cannot be completed at once, and must even be completed in infinite progress. Therefore, principles cannot become absolutely correct and unchanging things. If we blindly believe in principles and do not correspond and verify principles with constantly moving real phenomena, then these principles will lose their effect under the condition of no progress and cannot be used as tools to guide us in understanding things. Therefore, principles must be changed and can be modified. But what should we use to modify it? And what can make it change? This depends on the observation of new phenomena and the result of the experience of real phenomena. Therefore, principles also need the observation and experience of facts to supplement them.</p>
<p>However, we are not saying here that principles of any nature are necessary for our research. For a principle to have the necessity of guiding research, it must first be the result of abstraction from objective facts, the result of research, rather than the result of taking the principle itself as the starting point of research and re-producing it from it. Any product of a void and illusory principle and its reproduction, because it cannot adapt to nature and history, is therefore not correct. If it wants nature and society to adapt to it, it will inevitably be rejected by them, and we will not be able to use it as the starting point of research. On the contrary, if it is a principle formed by reality, then this principle is the result of research from the beginning of its birth. Therefore, if it is used as an indicator of research, this is not taking the principle as the starting point of research, but using the laws of things that have first broken into the human cognitive circle to deduce and seek other unknown things that are governed by the objective general and its laws. Such principles are not only necessary in research, but also have the ability to guide us to recognize new things.</p>
<p>In short, the principle that can guide our understanding and research is a product of experience; but once it is produced, it will turn around and dominate us to re-experience, and this re-experience will in turn constantly enrich and improve the principle, pushing it to a higher stage of development. In this way, true principles are not only not absolutely unchanging, but they also need to make themselves more correct and more scientific in the process of evolution, and play an important role in understanding and research. Those who do not want principles and those who adhere to dead principles will not be able to study phenomena and recognize the dynamic outside world.</p>

<h3 id="e229">Another Spring of Singing Birds and Falling Flowers <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Hui</p>
<p>"Spring sleep unaware of dawn, everywhere one hears singing birds. Last night the sounds of wind and rain, who knows how many flowers have fallen?" Dwelling on the enchanting Xuanwu Lake in this intoxicating spring, it's easy to recall this sorrowful verse. Yet, I don't love it; rather, I feel it's a eulogy to "spring's decline" and "falling flowers." I adore the youth of spring and don't want it to age. I cherish fresh blossoms and don't want them to wither. Therefore, I most dread reciting this "eulogy."</p>
<p>I've been living on the lake for almost two months. Though I hear fewer "singing birds," I witnessed a "falling of flowers" once. About a dozen days ago, the tender pink cherry blossoms adorned Xuanwu Lake beautifully, especially the young cherry trees outside my window, whose flowers bloomed even more vibrantly and brightly. Each time I opened the window, I felt they were smiling at me. That smile, oh, it was more intoxicating than the smile of a maiden. At that time, my ideal was: lovely flowers, I want to protect you and ensure your lasting existence, not allowing anyone to ravage you. But that night, I first heard the wind rattling the window frames, then the rain drumming against the window paper. My ardent heart immediately trembled, worried that the pure, delicate blossoms would be sullied and assailed by the wind and rain. Yet, I consoled myself: though the wind and rain are brutal, perhaps they won't harm innocent flowers; though the flowers are delicate, they also possess a stubborn spirit and youthful vigor, perhaps they can resist. So, I peacefully closed my eyes, seeking solace in dreams!</p>
<p>The next morning, the golden sunlight had filled the entire room before I reluctantly jumped out of bed. With no time for washing and grooming, I quickly pushed open the window frames. As I opened the window, I fully expected the flowers, after their baptism, to be even more exquisite than before. But as my eyes swept over the garden, what met my gaze was not the usual "smile," but a sorrowful, sickly appearance. Though I was plunged into an abyss of shock, I also doubted the accuracy of my own eyes. So, I quickly leaped out the window and rushed to the cherry trees, inspecting every tree and branch in detail. Many flowers had indeed fallen, leaving only sparse, diseased remnants on the branches! Then, surveying the ground, I discovered countless petals shedding tears at me. There were also many corpses, already buried in the mud, a deeply saddening sight. At this moment, I deeply felt ashamed: one like me, who loves flowers but cannot protect their lives, is ultimately not a true flower lover. Though I once styled myself as a protector of flowers, I ultimately failed to fulfill the responsibility of protection!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I still love flowers. On one hand, I grieved the tragic death of the flowers outside my window, and on the other hand, I worried about the fate of flowers elsewhere. So, with a bitter heart, I reluctantly made a tour of the entire lake. But everywhere I went in the cherry orchards, I saw only bare, broken branches, and those scattered petals, lying on the ground, panting and sighing! Finally, I climbed to the top of a high mound, moving my eyes to survey the entire lake: what met my gaze was not the usual exquisite beauty, but a bleak, sorrowful countenance. Facing this desolate, desolate scene, I could no longer bear the bitterness in my heart. I wanted to collect the flower corpses for a solemn burial, but that would be too sentimental. At the same time, I also thought that the exposure of the flower corpses would only serve to display the brutality of the wind and rain: its one night of unbridled power had cut short countless young lives!</p>
<p>As I walked home, listening to the "yang wu" (crows) incessantly wailing, each cry seemed to spread the bad news of the flowers. At this moment, I couldn't restrain the anger in my heart and couldn't help but secretly scold:</p>
<p>"You glib-tongued little crow, who asked you to spread this ill tidings? Where were you hiding when the storm raged last night? Take away your false compassion!"</p>
<p>Now, the peach and plum blossoms are in full bloom again. The peach blossoms are bright red, the plum blossoms are pure white, and this combination of red and white colors makes the entire Xuanwu Lake even more beautiful and radiant. Every day, I wander among these clusters of flowers, sometimes acting as a flower protector, and at the same time, enjoying the fragrance of the flowers and admiring their delicate beauty. How happy is my state of mind!</p>
<p>But facing these fresh and lively flowers, I also think of the fallen petals. Weren't the cherry blossoms just as fresh and lively before? But after one night of wind and rain, they became fragmented corpses. The peach and plum blossoms of today are so fresh and lively, but who knows if tomorrow they will not change into another form? If another storm comes tonight, what will be the outcome?</p>
<p>The wind and rain have no feelings. Their brutality knows no end. If they are pleased to unleash their unbridled power, the fragile flowers will be their victims! The cherry blossoms of the past were vividly sacrificed under their unbridled power. Can the peach and plum blossoms of today hope for their mercy? My ardent heart is truly worried for them! But while I worry for them, I am also annoyed by their excessive delicacy: they only know how to compete with their own kind in beauty and charm, without thinking of how to resist external violence. They only have beautiful appearances, without strong lives; only the inertia of surrender, without the spirit of struggle.</p>
<p>However, I still love them. But the single word "love" cannot transcend their wretched fate. Now it is late spring, and their lives have just reached their peak. If they are once ravaged by wind and rain, then the entire flower kingdom will be exterminated, and spring will also be declared shattered at the same time! Therefore, recently, whenever I hear the "crow's cry" in the early morning, I think that the bad news of the flowers has arrived. So, I hurriedly push open the window to see if it was windy and rainy last night. Because my experience is: the reason why crows cry is not only to spread the bad news of "falling flowers," but also to report that a storm is about to arrive. Therefore, I most fear hearing the crow's cry, and also fear remembering the "eulogy"-like verse—"Spring sleep unaware of dawn, everywhere one hears singing birds. Last night the sounds of wind and rain, who knows how many flowers have fallen?"</p>
<p>Various Industry Investigations</p>
<h3 id="e230">New Village Enterprise <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Chao</p>
<p>Since the Industrial Revolution, cities have expanded rapidly, and the countryside has become increasingly barren. However, urban life is a purely mechanical and unnatural one. Therefore, a major issue in society now is how to make cities possess the joys of the countryside and how to make the countryside also have the benefits of the city. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to "ruralize cities" and "urbanize the countryside," and the new village system has arisen in response to this need.</p>
<p>England's industrial and commercial development was the earliest in the world, so the need to transform English cities is also the most urgent. The establishment of new villages first originated in England. Before the European War, the number of new villages in England had reached more than fifty. Recently, countries in Continental Europe have also followed suit and established new village organizations. For example, Germany has established an association in Berlin and branches in various places. France has also established its headquarters in Paris, and its branches have been extended to Belgium, the Netherlands, and other countries. The best results in operating new villages in Continental Europe have been achieved by the Krupp ironworks' workers' new village in Essen, Prussia. The second best is the new village created by Pullman, the owner of the Pullman Car Company factory in America. Its architectural structure focuses on cleanliness, and every residence must be attached to a garden, so that flowers and trees are in bloom in all seasons, making it the most beautiful new village.</p>
<p>The new village movement now has a tendency to sweep the world. The construction of new villages in Continental Europe, as well as North and South America, India, Japan, and other countries, is increasing daily. Looking back at our country, although the development of industry and commerce is still slow, the evils of cities are already very obvious. Today, the primary goal of our government is to find ways to avoid the evils of cities, so the construction of new villages is extremely urgent. After the May Fourth Movement, although Mr. Zhou Zuoren made great efforts to promote it, giving the people of the country an impression of the new village movement, unfortunately, no true new village has yet appeared.</p>
<p>Since the China New Village Construction Society and the Xinhua Bank separately established new villages, people across the country have paid close attention. It is understood that the first new village established by the society is called "Rose Garden New Village," which covers an area of 100 acres in Xijiatang on the Shanghai-Minhang Road, and is adjacent to the Shanghai Middle School affiliated with Jiangsu Province. Construction has already begun, and about a dozen residences will soon be completed. Its transportation with the Shanghai Concession is via the Shanghai-Minhang Road, and the village also has its own buses that travel between the village and the Bund on Nanjing Road. In addition to transportation, other public facilities for residents, such as running water, electricity, telephone, postal service, markets, etc., are all available. In terms of public services, such as education, there is a complete elementary school with a kindergarten, and plans are underway to establish a library and sports field. In terms of health, a health center (equivalent to a small-scale hospital) is specially set up to plan public health services. In addition, the architectural plan of the village is originally a garden-style village, with dozens of acres of open space planted with trees and flowers, and a designer is specially hired to arrange everything. A park is also set up in the village for residents to rest and play. In order to improve economic life, cooperative enterprises are specially advocated. On the one hand, it connects residents to launch a cooperative enterprise promotion association, and on the other hand, it establishes a household assistance group to promote household cooperation. A family craft room is also set up to create service opportunities for women in the village, inviting housewives in the village who are proficient in family crafts to be responsible for guiding silkworm rearing, silk reeling, bee keeping and honey brewing, as well as weaving, embroidery, knotting, sewing, and other crafts to enrich the meaning of women's lives.</p>
<p>The engineering design of the houses adopts a modern style on the outside; the balanced layout adopts a convex and concave overlapping style. The houses are independent, each with its own private garden. But it also attaches great importance to the scenery of the entire village, so that it becomes consistent and forms a large garden. Whether viewed from a distance or up close, there are no drawbacks of emptiness or obstruction. The internal structure of the houses is designed with comfort and practicality in mind, without being wasteful or too narrow and cramped. It is also decided to build a magnificent and splendid civic hall in the center of the village as a place for residents to hold weddings, funerals, celebrations, or public gatherings at ordinary times, hoping to encourage residents to spontaneously organize various clubs and societies, so that the entire village has a spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation. In terms of security, in addition to building a strong and dense fence of more than ten feet high around the village, a section of iron railing has been built along the Shanghai-Minhang Road. The Shanghai County Government has built a bunker about a hundred steps away from the village gate, and will set up a police station in front of the village gate to station guards on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Initially, the society announced the first phase of its plan, stipulating that the residences in Rose Garden New Village would be of three types: A, B, and C, and each level would be divided into three styles for residents to freely choose. The prices of the three A-level styles were set at 9,000 yuan per house, occupying one mu of land. The prices of the three B-level styles were set at 12,000 yuan, also occupying one mu of land, but with more rooms. The prices of the three C-level styles were set at 18,000 yuan, occupying two mu of land. The above prices include: (1) land price, (2) construction cost, (3) sanitation equipment, (4) private garden and ground plants, (5) public buildings in the village (including roads, auditoriums, libraries, sports fields, parks, health centers, elementary schools, kindergartens, public kitchens, new village management offices, police stations, markets, etc.) (6) public facilities in the village (including buses, electricity, telephone, running water, fire fighting equipment, etc.). Those who order houses first select the demarcated base, location, and house style. (The society also has a general site map, house drawings, and various reference tables.) They can estimate their own economic strength and adopt the method of paying in full at once or paying in installments. This method of paying in installments is actually the same as paying rent monthly for those who rent houses in Shanghai. First pay the land price and a deposit of about one-quarter of the total price, and then you can repay it monthly from two to ten years according to your own wishes. However, ordinary rent payments are indefinitely burdened permanently, while ordering a house in Rose Garden New Village allows you to set the rent payment period yourself, and you can obtain ownership of the real estate when it expires. Therefore, since the first phase of the plan was announced, dozens of people have ordered houses. Later, in order to popularize the plan among urban salaried classes and in view of the economic downturn in various industries, in order to reduce the burden on those who pay rent monthly indefinitely, the second phase of the popularization plan was announced.</p>
<p>The second phase of the popularization plan divides the residences into two levels: D and E. Each level is divided into two styles. The architectural forms are beautiful and solid both inside and out. You only need to pay a construction fee of 500-600 yuan in advance, and then you can pay the rent in installments annually and monthly. According to the pre-determined contract, you can obtain ownership of the real estate when the rent is paid in full upon the expiration of a certain number of years. This method is called the "subscription for construction and rental with periodic acquisition of real estate ownership in installments method." The longest period is twelve years, and the shortest is one year. D-type properties are quite similar to double-fronted Western-style residences in Shanghai, but occupy half a mu of land, and have sanitation equipment and a private garden; E-type properties are similar to single-fronted small Western-style houses in the city, but are double-fronted flat-roofed, also occupy half a mu of land, and have sanitation equipment and a private garden. It is said that there are now many people subscribing for construction and renting D and E-type houses, because the rent is less than that in the city, and the life and environment are much more comfortable and beautiful than in the city.</p>
<p>Recently, well-known banks in this city, such as Guohua Bank, Szehsing Savings Society, and their various branches, are all happy to act as agents for the society to handle subscription orders for residents, which further increases social belief in the advocacy of the new village movement. Moreover, the society also has extremely novel contributions to the expansion of the new village base and cooperative investment in the construction of new villages. The society has now announced a special method of cooperative investment in new village housing, wanting to put stagnant funds to safe use. They divide the investment in new village real estate into two types: (1) arbitrary investment, which does not fix a number, with 500 yuan in national currency as the minimum. Investors can estimate their own financial resources and determine the number themselves. (2) whole-house investment, which can be determined based on the type of new village residence, but one person can invest in a maximum of ten houses. This investment method adopts a resident cooperation system. Both parties are based on the spirit of concerted efforts in advance. The resident party can obtain ownership of the real estate upon the expiration of the subscription for construction and rental period, while the investor party has no worries about vacant rentals. Only after there are people who have subscribed for construction and rental housing is cooperative investment solicited, thus balancing supply and demand. You can also set the period in advance according to your own wishes. It is equivalent to exchanging cumbersome real estate for valuable bonds. At the same time, from the perspective of rescuing bankrupt rural areas, it is also the only way to develop productive enterprises with stagnant capital. The new village is a model village, which not only improves the chaotic urban living environment, but also gradually makes the countryside scientific. With the new village to disperse the accumulated wealth of the business community, to comfort the narrowness and bitterness of the city. In normal times, personnel and business conditions can be adjusted, so that there is no worry about wealth accumulating and having nowhere to use it; in the event of war or major natural disasters, because guarding and defense are customary, unity and cooperation can help each other, and the essence of the city will not be completely destroyed because it is concentrated in one place. If it were not for the many new villages—rural cities—in England during the European War and Japan during the Great Earthquake, I am afraid that the tragedy of the entire city's destruction would have already been staged.</p>

<p>This beautiful hometown is devastated. This hometown nurtured by verdant scenery, this hometown where more than two thousand people dreamed beautiful dreams, this hometown with the active traces of countless generations of ancestors, this hometown with rows of houses and beautiful pastoral gardens is devastated.</p>
<p>Jin Sheng looked back and thought of his own home, tears welling up in his eyes.</p>
<p>Zhang Lingfu, sitting at the bow of the boat, shouted violently: "Damn it, other people's boats have already passed Tangwan. You don't care about the lives of everyone on this boat!"</p>
<p>The boat also turned past Tangwan. The road, which used to have few pedestrians, now also had groups of people running as fast as they could.</p>
<p>Jin Sheng saw Uncle A Jiang, hunchbacked and carrying two heavy quilts, squeezed into the crowd, moving like a snail. This old man was being left behind by the young people. The old man's footsteps suddenly stopped, and the hunchbacked back disappeared. Jin Sheng was puzzled. Then the old man was carrying the hunchbacked back forward again, but the objects on his back seemed to have been reduced by half.</p>
<p>There was another woman, like Li's younger brother's woman, carrying a child on her back, and also leading a larger child in her right hand. The child was not used to running fast, crying and shouting, the shrill sound agitated the thin air, and the mother still dragged him along with difficulty.</p>
<p>The road was getting closer to the river bank. Jin Sheng saw that there were scattered large and small packages tied up tightly on the bank, clothes that were too heavy to carry on the long journey, and had to be abandoned.</p>
<p>— Wah...wah...um...</p>
<p>A two-year-old girl, like the clothes, was abandoned in the vegetable field, her voice hoarse, no one willing to take her with them.</p>
<p>— Hey, Uncle A Jiang, where are you escaping to? Why didn't your son and daughter-in-law take you with them? Jin Sheng raised his voice to ask the person on the dike.</p>
<p>A Jiang gasped sadly.</p>
<p>— Everyone is fleeing for their lives! The house was hit by a × foreigner's bomb!</p>
<p>— Where to?</p>
<p>— Where to? Go to Lujiazai to take shelter.</p>
<p>— Hey, hey, Uncle A Jiang, Zhang's family at the end of West Market Street... Hey, hey, Zhang Lingfu's family, is everything alright?</p>
<p>Zhang Lingfu made a sound like a broken gong.</p>
<p>— Don't mention it, don't mention it. Bombs are like bird's eggs, a dozen or so fall down at once. Hey, the end of West Market Street is okay, the worst is the city center.</p>
<p>After A Jiang said this, the people at the end of West Market Street showed a slight joy, but the faces of those in the city center turned pale.</p>
<p>— Hey, Uncle A Jiang, we, Li... Hey, on Daqian Street...</p>
<p>— Me, Zhang Delong... Uncle A Jiang!</p>
<p>— A Jiang...</p>
<p>Everyone was talking at once, A Jiang couldn't handle it, and just shouted loudly:</p>
<p>— Lin Wende was bombed to death, it was really tragic! That stone flew straight to the Chenghuang Temple square and plunged three feet deep. Lin Wende's body couldn't be found...</p>
<p>— Ah, it's all because of installing the damn time bell in the elementary school! Damn it, it was too high and attracted attention!</p>
<p>— Really, didn't you see the plane always circling on top of it?</p>
<p>The voices became lively up and down the embankment.</p>
<p>The people on the boat and the people on the shore were talking loudly. The people on the boat were also talking in lower voices with each other. The women's chatterboxes were all open.</p>
<p>The women thought about what other things, valuable and useful things, they hadn't taken away, and hated themselves for being confused. Ah, they hadn't taken the jewelry with them either. Thinking and talking, regret and love intertwined, and Zhang Lingfu's woman cried.</p>
<p>Zhang Lingfu cursed: "Damn it, you woman are the most useless. The Zhang family can be considered to be all exhausted."</p>
<p>The people in the same boat were attracted by this couple. Hearing this, everyone laughed. But then thinking of themselves, and the great disaster to come, they immediately gathered their laughter and were attacked by sorrow again.</p>
<p>The Lou River turned again.</p>
<p>The people in the boat could only see the group of people rising and falling on the mountain-like dike. After a while, they were all gone.</p>
<p>— Jin Sheng, let's find a secluded reed pond to hide in for tonight, and then figure out what to do!</p>
<p>— Yes, we can't leave home too far. If we're too far away, what will we live on?</p>
<p>The weather got a little colder, and everyone felt a little chilly. The sky was getting dark.</p>
<p>Jin Sheng docked the boat by the side of the bank where there was a bamboo forest. There was already a boat with the same fate parked next to it.</p>
<p>The boat was tied up.</p>
<p>The young people hadn't stretched their bones all day, so they all jumped ashore and looked towards Lou Town. Looking out, the darkness was still permeating the end of the vast wilderness.</p>
<p>In the vast night, it could be seen that red light was rising.</p>

<p>— Written by Japanese Tsurumi Yusuke, Translated by Zhou Leshan and Qi Junfu</p>
<p>When this happened, after those elders who had insulted him left, he picked up the mud-covered collection of poems from the gutter, brushed the dust off his soiled clothes, and threw himself on the green grass of the pasture by the Thams River, looking up at the towering Winzer Palace, and looking down at the mirror-like flowing water.</p>
<p>At this time, in his hand was a volume of Political Justice by William Godwin. Meditating on the misery and injustice of human society, he swore:</p>
<p>"I swear by the righteous and wise freedom: I swear not to be a subordinate of self-seekers and powerful people, and dedicate my own life to the worship of beauty."</p>
<p>The thoughts of youth dominate a lifetime. Shelley's life was spent fighting for this riverside oath.</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>His grandfather was full of eccentricities, and like him, he was also not at home often. His father was a typical Englishman, an ordinary man, who only knew how to float and sink with the world. The mother, however, took a strong man as her ideal and hated her eldest son for taking books to the forest to meditate. However, the three younger sisters worshipped and caressed their brother like a god.</p>
<p>At the age of eighteen, he entered Oxford University.</p>
<p>He lived simply like a child. As a hater of meat, his pockets were always full of biscuits and bread. When walking on the road, he read books while eating with a "jia da jia da" sound. He lived without knowing day and night.</p>
<p>At this time, he began to write novels and essays. And he printed his work The Necessity of Atheism and displayed it in the storefront of a bookstore near the university.</p>
<p>The next day, he was summoned by the principal and the student supervisor, who announced:</p>
<p>"Expulsion!"</p>
<p>Also expelled was his friend Theames Jefferson Hogg. They came to London together, rented a house, and began to live. The mediocre father, seeing that his son had been expelled, felt that it was related to his own face, so he went to London to force his son to change his ways. If he did not repent, he would cut off his supplies. Shelley refused his father's wishes, so he was cut off as planned.</p>
<p>This was the beginning of his lifelong poverty.</p>

<h3 id="e234">Liao Hua as Vanguard <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Xiong</p>
<p>Even in my childhood, I watched a legend of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Because I was young then, and because so many years have passed, most of the story has faded from memory. However, for some reason, the struggle of the Shu Kingdom before its demise is still vaguely remembered.</p>
<p>Although Kong Ming's six expeditions to Mount Qi seemed lively and tense, with many magical feats, between the lines there was already a hint of decline, desolation, and the difficulty of the struggle. When Kong Ming passed away, the Shu Kingdom's life was also on its last breath. The Five Tiger Generals, whom readers of the novel were so familiar with, no longer appeared in the text at this time. With the Shu Kingdom lacking great generals, Liao Hua actually became the vanguard. Reading this, I often sighed in disappointment.</p>
<p>At that time, I did not mean to belittle Liao Hua, but I just thought, how unfortunate that the Shu Kingdom was about to perish, and talented people were being buried.</p>
<p>Today's world is still the same as before. A, B, C, etc., are arranged in neat ranks. When A dies, B fills A's vacancy; when B dies, C fills B's vacancy. But when B dies, there is no one to succeed C, and C may not be able to shoulder the great responsibility. Therefore, "Liao Hua as vanguard" is the only option left. Even if Liao Hua himself is well aware that he is not up to the task, he can only reluctantly do his best.</p>
<p>The key here is that when the Five Tiger Generals were in their prime, they did not know how to encourage the next generation of talent. Once there was a gap between generations, the overall situation would be over.</p>
<p>Climbing up is a matter of course in the minds of Chinese people. A lifetime of hard work is just to hope that one day they can climb to the top. At that time, society in general will reward them for their past experience and their spirit of waiting for rabbits, and naturally acknowledge them as the successor. At this time, he is often no more than a talent like Liao Hua. In China, except for periods of historical upheaval that can create a few heroes, people have never been good at identifying real talent. This is probably because "youngsters becoming famous" seems to be a threat to their older predecessors.</p>
<p>After all, when Liao Hua was the vanguard, the Shu Kingdom was in its final struggle.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should learn a lesson from this: one Liao Hua cannot stop the new elite of Jin, let alone the Five Tiger Generals, so what can they do to make Liu [Shu] last forever?</p>

<h3 id="e240">Hollywood's Shady Dealings: The Audition of Movie Actors (Part 1) <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>In this place of Shanghai, we often see news in the newspapers about young men and women being deceived by signing up for movie schools and newly established companies in the hope of entering the film industry. In reality, such things are endless. And it's not just Shanghai that has this kind of thing. Even in Hollywood, where film companies are numerous and people should have more knowledge and experience, there is no lack of such shady dealings. We will now translate some of what we have read in American film magazines.</p>
<p>These people who create shady dealings use all sorts of tricks and lay out a maze, waiting for young men and women with short sight, lack of experience, and excessive enthusiasm to fall into the trap. We will now reveal various inside stories, hoping that young men and women aspiring to film can gain some experience after reading this. Wasting money is secondary; wasting time, or even drifting to another place and being unable to return, is truly a tragedy.</p>
<p>Let's first talk about the shady dealings of stage auditions. In Hollywood and Los Angeles, there are many theaters. Because these are all regarded as the outer warehouses or showrooms of film companies—film tycoons often come to select new talent—many men and women who want to enter the film industry but have no way in want to first try their hand on stage and gain some initial experience.</p>
<p>Sure enough, one day, A saw a small advertisement in the newspaper: "Musical comedy, to be staged soon. Auditions for actors, singers, dancers, etc." He followed the address published in the newspaper and found the place. The room was decorated to look very presentable. The receptionist was very attentive, knowing that the god of wealth had arrived. The manager, upon seeing him, immediately said that he was exactly the person they were looking for. The conditions were also very favorable. They told him that they were in contact with a famous movie star and were assigning him an important role.</p>
<p>The next day, he ran over there, and they were already selecting dancers. He counted, and there were at least seventy-five of them. Even more coincidentally, not a single one was rejected. He ignored that and went to find the manager. Their conversation was still very satisfactory. After a while, the manager came out to address everyone, about a hundred people in total. He spun a yarn, saying that so-and-so was the financial backer, how the government was assisting, because this was a patriotic endeavor. Rehearsals were scheduled to begin in two weeks.</p>
<p>The manager also said, "Please, everyone, do not mention this matter outside, because they do not approve of advance publicity and want to amaze people in one fell swoop after the rehearsals are complete." The auditionee was somewhat suspicious at first, wondering why they had to keep it so secret, but he seemed to have heard of the name of the big shot, and with the government's assistance, it was probably not a lost cause.</p>
<p>After many days, their play was about to be rehearsed. One day, they, the young men and women who had been selected, all received a notice that rehearsals would begin the next day. They all arrived on time. They were invited into the manager's office in rows. The manager, looking worried, told everyone that the musical comedy was scheduled to debut in Seattle within six weeks, but that the big shot had suddenly died. He said that his own money was almost gone. Now he was short of some maintenance funds. He wanted to sell the entire troupe, assets, etc., to someone else. But selling it to someone else and letting them make money—money that was almost guaranteed—was not as good as having their own people take over. If each of them was willing to contribute ten dollars as a share, the rehearsals could continue. After the opening, they would surely make money, a small investment with huge profits.</p>
<p>Many people thought what he said made sense and readily agreed, especially since ten dollars wasn't much. But ten dollars per person, a hundred people is a thousand dollars. Of course, the play never opened. The movie star mentioned was later encountered, and she had no idea about this at all. The so-called big shot either didn't exist at all, or did exist, but hadn't died.</p>
<p>A month later, the auditionee saw a similar advertisement in another newspaper. He was a veteran and had more experience, but he still wanted to try, hoping to encounter something real. He went to the address as usual. He found it. He walked into the manager's office. As before, they told him that he was exactly what they needed and asked him to come back tomorrow to get the script.</p>
<p>The next day, he went again. He was surprised to find that he wasn't the only one being given a script and told to study it. But the manager saw his suspicion, walked over, and whispered to him, "Don't worry. They're just putting on a show. The role has already been assigned to you." He also told him that the others weren't qualified enough. The manager even gave him a script, told him to read it carefully, and asked him to come back next week for the official rehearsals. When next week came, he received a notice and went as scheduled. But something was wrong.</p>
<p>When he got there, he saw that the room was crowded with people. He thought that a theater troupe definitely couldn't accommodate so many people. He already understood in his heart that it must be some kind of trick. Sure enough, he found out that there were six people playing each role. The manager was about to distribute the lines, which were typed. But before handing them out, he announced that these lines had been lost too many times before, and now he had to recover some of the cost of the printed paper. Not much, just two dollars and fifty cents per copy. But for a hundred people, that's two hundred and fifty dollars. Not bad for five days of pay. This was his second experience. Of course, he wasn't fooled himself. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3 id="e241">Review of "Song of Sorrow" <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Han</p>
<p>——Jin Cheng Ying</p>
<p>Presenting the unemployment of intellectuals as a problem to the audience, in the current wave of unemployment panic, the seriousness of the theme of "Song of Sorrow" is indeed very worthy of attention. However, having good content but not being able to express it through film techniques is a great loss. Therefore, it cannot obtain a relatively significant social response, and people sincerely regret "Song of Sorrow."</p>
<p>In "Song of Sorrow," the playwright very simply tells us that in this society where there are more people than jobs, the intellectual youth are being pushed closer and closer to the starvation line. However, they have a sense of justice and would rather their children die of starvation than write an article on "coexistence and co-prosperity" that sells out national interests against their conscience. These kinds of young people are people we can often come into contact with. They have great vision, they have passionate justice, however, because they have too much conscience, they are not tolerated by the current society, and so they can only walk on the dead end of life!</p>
<p>This is a fairly realistic tragedy, at least it should garner sympathy from intellectuals. But we can only say that the playwright had a good concept, but did not express this concept in an image-based way. The playwright cannot hide the fact that he is not organized in the story, and is presenting it in a fragmented way before the audience. What he can do is narrate one party, then drop the other party, and sometimes use accidental opportunities to connect them, without any strict structure. The development of the two lines of Hu Ping, Wang Naidong, and Li Minghui, Wang Yin, is not intricately intertwined, and then from Li Minghui, Wang Yin, a third line of Qin Tong is separated, which makes it even more confusing.</p>
<p>Of course, no one will ignore the director's unfamiliar techniques. His tone for the play is so slow that it makes people feel like they are in a dream. I almost suspect that this film has not been edited. If there had been better weaving, it might have achieved better results. There are few moving scenes, and the entire play is such a "promise" to the audience that it will take two hours, which I think is unnecessary.</p>
<p>Looking at the director's negligence from a smaller perspective, such as Wang Yin having black hair in the same scene one moment, and white hair the next. When Wang Yin's child dies, the close-up of the low-angle shot makes the child look like a doughy adult. When Hu Ping sings about Ehuang and Nuying, the movements of the four dancing girls have nothing to do with the mood of the song, truly so-called active background!</p>
<p>In short, here there is no expression of a balance with sorrow, no coordination of fast and slow. Several actors such as Li Minghui, Wang Naidong, Wang Yin, Hu Ping, Qin Tong, etc., have all had quite a bit of success before, but here, apart from the individual places where some of the actors' cleverness is brought into play, they are all so ordinary because the director has no good direction and handling of them. There are a few very nice sets, but without good plays to match them, they just seem like extravagant waste. As for the dubbing, it is even more immature. Apart from the reality of the theme, in terms of technique, "Song of Sorrow" cannot become a successful tragedy.</p>

<h3 id="e244">The Story of the Confiscation of the Anti-Chinese Film in Canada <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Zhuling</p>
<p>The newly established Northern Film Company in Victoria, Canada, recently released an anti-Chinese film. The film is called "Black Robe," and the first act is called "Secrets of Chinatown." The content describes the mysterious Chinese societies in the Chinese area of the city, smuggling opium, and worshiping Guanyin Bodhisattva as the center of the mysterious union, etc. The film began production last year and went to a antique store run by a Chinese named Yuan to buy Chinese clothing and decorations. Yuan also introduced some unscrupulous Chinese to act as actors for the filming. After the overseas Chinese discovered this, the Chinese Association sent representatives to negotiate with the local city government and ask them to ban it, but the film had already been completed and was shown at the Empire Theater in the city in March this year. After learning about this, our country's consulate immediately sent a letter to the city government to protest and negotiated with the film censor. After receiving the letter, the censor presented it to the Ministry of Justice to order the provincial police to go to the company and confiscate the film, thus ending the matter.</p>

<h3 id="e245">Living on Velvet (Part 1) <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Ti Yun</p>
<p>Produced by Warner Brothers of America, starring Ke Fu Lan Qian Si and others</p>
<p>It was an autumn afternoon. Countless spectators gathered at Curtis Airfield to watch the air force perform. Suddenly, a foreign aircraft, most likely a privately owned one, soared into the sky. It flew back and forth wildly among the air force planes, disrupting their formation, causing those watching below to lose color, and even throwing off the rhythm of the military band. At this moment, the radio announcer reported over the loudspeaker: "No one knows what's going on... We don't know where that aircraft came from. It's disrupting the air force formation... We don't know who's piloting it... It doesn't look like a military aircraft... This is very strange... It almost collided with Captain Ramsay's plane... The stands are in chaos..."</p>
<p>Sure enough, after the air force formation was disturbed by the strange aircraft, it scattered and gradually descended. The strange aircraft, as if aware of the disturbance below, also flew down. After the aircraft stopped, a young man in plain clothes jumped out. He was tall, burly, with sleek black hair and an arrogant demeanor. He got out of the plane and adjusted his tie. Many flight instructors swarmed around him, surrounding him. One of them said, "The major wants to see you. Go see him."</p>
<p>The young man, seemingly oblivious, muttered to himself, "Sorry for parking my plane in the middle of the airfield." As he spoke, he followed a group of officers to the major. The major asked him, "What's your name?" The young man replied, "Thorpe Park." The major asked again, "What were you doing in the sky?" Thorpe Park said, "I was also flying, flying." His fearless attitude shocked the officers standing nearby and listening intently into silence.</p>
<p>At this point, the major jumped up and said, "Oh, you were flying, flying. Do you know that you disrupted today's air force drill formation? Tell me quickly, what's going on?" Thorpe said nonchalantly, "I'm afraid I won't speak well if I speak too quickly. But seriously, although my flying may seem to have exceeded a considerable scope, I haven't broken any laws because there are no laws in the sky. I'm afraid you can't arrest me."</p>
<p>At this moment, a person suddenly rushed in. His name was Walter Blystrong. He was a friend of Thorpe Park and had rushed to rescue him upon hearing the news. He didn't necessarily know that Thorpe had committed a crime. He just knew that Thorpe had returned after a year and a half of utter silence, and that a strange aircraft had been found on the airfield. He knew it must be Thorpe Park. Walter walked in, and without greeting Thorpe, he spoke directly to the major, "My name is Walter Blystrong, a close friend of General Howard. Please leave Park's matter to me. I will ensure that he doesn't re-offend."</p>
<p>Thorpe Park's eyebrows twitched slightly, revealing a hint of a smile, upon hearing Walter Blystrong's words. The major said, "Of course, we don't need him to participate in our air force drills here." As he spoke, he released Thorpe Park. Thorpe then said to Walter, "Shall I go move the plane over?" Walter said, "No! Let's go out together... by car... I'll drive myself." They talked all the way, mostly Walter.
