<h3>軍政部長何應欽闢謠</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>自日海軍陸戰隊兵士中山秀雄被害事件發生以後。上海及其附近區域。謠諑繁興。一二八戰區及虹口一帶居民。紛紛向以南租界遷移傢具箱籠。相接于道。營業汽車。被雇一空。昨前兩日。甚至有深夜尙在搬塲者。此種浮動現象。不僅使市民本身受經濟損失。滬北復興陷于停滯而已。卽就對外關係而言。恐亦難免發生幾許影反也。</p>
<p>此次無意識的避　狀態乃市民經信無稽謠言之結果。固不待言。然推究根源實有二點。一爲淞滬戰禍之惡夢。在市民腦際尙未消除。今次日水兵被害事件易使市民回復往日之恐怖心理。二爲近日適當新貨幣政策頒布未久而各方要人精誠團結。雲集首都。舉行五全大會。此二者爲黨國重大事件。好事者及投機家不免藉以作種種捕風捉影之猜測。轉輾傳播。而一般知識淺薄之市民。遂以幻作眞矣。</p>
<p>軍政部長何應欽氏。昨日發表闢謠談話。謂中央對日外交一本親善精神。以求兩國間之改善。此種政策。絕未變更。上海謠傳全非事實等語。同時上海市政府除令行公安局。禁止居戶無端遷徙外。其負責人亦有聲明發表。希望市民以常識判斷謠言。以鎮靜觀察時局。當此人心浮動之際。負責當局之剴切表示。誠屬切要。數日來瀰漫全滬之暗澹空氣。從此當可一掃矣。</p>

<h3>菲列賓　第一屆大總統奎松</h3>
<p>— 不忍</p>
<p>本年九月十日，菲列賓根據獨立法案，舉行第一屆自治政府大選：結果，聯合黨領袖奎松及奧士敏那二氏當選爲正副總統，競選人老革命家亞銀那多將軍及阿格里巴主敎都落了選。奎松氏便在昨天就了六年任期的首任大總統的職位。</p>
<p>在各國元首中，奎松的出身可說是最寒微的了。他今年五十七歲，誕生於離馬尼刺很遠的鄉間，父親是一個窮苦的農人。幼時他在馬尼刺受過幾年敎育，後來投筆從戎；一八九八年菲列賓大革命時，二十歲的奎松做了亞銀那多將軍所指揮的革命軍隊中一個下級軍官。</p>
<p>一九〇〇年，他的同學奧士敏那在西布（Cebn）創辦「每日新聞」日報，鼓吹獨立，奎松是一個有力的贊助者。一九〇六年，奧氏組織「急進獨立黨」，奎松加入爲黨中的靑年領袖。次年「急進獨立黨」與「聯合國民黨」合併改組爲「菲列賓國民黨一，奧氏被戴爲黨魁，奎松不過是一個二等領袖而巳。</p>
<p>奎松獲得大顯身手的機會，是從一九一二年開始的。從那時起，他被菲議會派爲駐美專員，與美國政治舞台人士相週旋，熱烈地作如下的宣傳：</p>
<p>「菲列賓的民衆，决不會以受美國或其他任何國家的統治爲快事的。自從受西班牙統治以來，本國的政治至少得受他人的干涉。如是，菲律賓的人民是决不會滿足的。爲什麽呢？因爲他們尙未得到他們應有的權利。故除將他們自身的事完全由他們自己管理外，决不能得到菲人的眞正滿足及感謝的。」</p>
<p>奎松的滔滔的雄辯與誠摯的外貌終於博得威爾遜大總統及其治下的進步黨與民主黨的好感。結果，被稱爲「瓊斯法案」的菲律賓自治條令得在一九一六年通過於美國參議院。從此，菲列賓的獨立運動得到了法律上的根據，奎松個人在國內的政治地位亦一躍而上。一九一七年，菲議會改爲兩院制，奎松獲選爲參院議長，一直連任到今年；奧士敏那則爲衆院議長。從此，國民黨暗分兩派，一派以奎松爲領袖，後來成爲「國民民主黨」，另一派以奧士敏那爲領袖，後來成爲「獨立民主黨」，兩派明爭暗鬥，各不相下。</p>
<p>一九三三年，奧氏領導獨立請求團赴美，爭得被稱爲「卡丁法案」的具體獨立案，歸菲後，滿望壓倒奎松，不料為奎松派所反對。奎松派因該法案內附有軍事根據地的保留條文，深致不滿，發起反對運動，高唱「立即獨立」與「完全獨立」等口號。「卡丁法案」遂爲菲議會所拒絕了。</p>
<p>反對卡丁法案的奎松，爲貫澈主張起見，另組獨立請求團，親自領導赴美，運動羅斯福及其他政治人員，予以修正。奔走結果，終算如願以償，羅斯福批准了達丁斯的修正法案。本年五月一日，此修正法案得通過於菲列賓兩院。至此，菲列賓的獨立運動，吿一段落。</p>
<p>其實，「達丁斯修正案」與原來的「卡丁法案」，並無多大差異，不過翻了這麽一個新花樣，奎松遂獲得黨人及民衆的擁戴而已。奎松的被選爲大總統，固巳胸有成竹了吧。不幸的奧士敏那本來連副總統也沒有他的份兒的，適因德高望重的老革命家亞銀那多將軍出而競選大總統，奎松頗覺畏懼，遂不得不拉攏奧氏以與競爭。因此，兩黨又重修舊好，組成聯合黨，而兩黨領袖遂獲得競選的勝利。</p>
<p>大選揭曉的次日，奎松對衆宣稱道：</p>
<p>「選來結果，表示國民信仰聯合黨的黨綱與人士。在這勝利的時刻，我只想着放在我面前的重大工作。我求上帝幫助來應付已放在我肩上的嚴重的責任。我深致感謝於如此尊重我的人民。」</p>
<p>在這里，我們看出奎松的得意與謙遜參半。不過，奎松且慢自得意，亦不必濂遜。菲列賓能否眞正獨立，奎松能否成爲眞正的領袖，道些問題的解答從昨天方纔開始哩。</p>

<p>北碚參觀記（上）</p>
<p>十月六日晨、記者與頌華君二人、一同冒雨作北碚之遊、因我們對北碚的新建設事業、在滬時已聞其名、及到重慶、和朋友談起、又都說、北碚不可不去看看、所以我們一到重慶、即往北碚參觀、是日、我們侵晨四時即起、　洗後、忽忽收拾行裝、即乘前一天晚上所　就的轎十上千司門碼頭、在晨光曦微中、到民生輪上時、鐘剛敲過五點、一路秋雨淅澀、頗感不便、重慶多雨、深以為苦、船上乘客擁擠、人聲嘈雜、船票至北碚一律大洋一元、不分等級、頗合平民化原則、惟座位少而乘客多、後至者每有向隅之嘆、我們承民生公司經理鄭璧成君之招待、坐在經理室內、幸免擁擠、私心甚感、六時半、船循嘉陵江上駛、探首窗外、遙見兩岸風景如畫、由重慶至北碚溫糸公圍、路程不過百四十餘里、中間須經過嘉陵江二峽（觀音峽、溫泉峽）、此外尚有牛鼻峽、這三峽風景、雖不及長江三峽的雄偉奇險、而秀麗則過之、茲將北碚各方面情形、就見聞所及、略述於下、</p>
<p>一、溫泉公園　是午刻、船抵溫泉公園、登岸後、拾級而上、比時、公園內正籌備舉行集團結甚忙、少年義勇隊隊員亦各從事禮堂、與會塲之並屬古剎、迄今佛像猶存、自民國十六年盧作孚氏長峽防局後、始銳意經營、現巳成爲公衆的遊實區、園中花木頗盛、風景幽雅、步行其中、恍如置身淸凉世界、公園中設備有旅館、飯店、浴室浴塘、游泳池、網球塲、籃球塲、圖書室、音樂室等、聞重慶、北碚許多羣衆聚會、多在此間舉行、我們承民生公司鄭經理和馬經理的引導、曾遊覽各嚴洞、次日晨、冒雨選縉雲寺、因時間忽促、半途而回、不勝悵惘、下午、在公園禮堂觀集團結婚典禮、此次信團結婚、係由民間自動提倡、費用甚省、足矯一般舊時繫文縟禮虛糜金錢之習慣、</p>

<h3>國曆的好處</h3>
<p>— 中央研究院天文研究所研究員　陳遵嬀</p>
<p>（十一月八日十日二天對全國民衆講）</p>
<p>我們所要講的題目是「國歷的好處」我們在沒有講這個題目以前，要先知道什麼呌做曆？什麼呌做國曆？然後才能够知道他的好處在那裏，並且一件東西的好壞，本來沒有什麼標準的，甲可以說他好，同時乙也可以說他壞，所以一件東西的好壞，要和另外一個東西相比較，才可以知道他的好壞。所以我們要說國歷的好處，要另外拿一個歷和他相比較，才可以知道他的好處，現在我們要拿做比較的歷法，就是我們所廢除的舊歷，所以我們在未講這個題目以前，還要先知道舊歷是怎樣的做成。所以我講這個題目，可以分做三段，第一是什麽呌做歷？第二是國歷和舊歷是怎樣作成？第三是國曆的好處。</p>
<p>現在我們先問一問歷有什麽意義？歷到底是什麽東西？用普通的話來講，歷可以說就是歷本或且歷書。要正確一點的講，歷就是歷法，至於歷的本身是毫無意義的，他是因爲社會上的需要，然後才發生出來的。他是隨着人類的進化而進展的。各位都知道太陽對於我們的位置有兩種最顯明的運動。第一是東昇西沒的運動，第二是南北進退的運動。這兩種運動的成因，前次已經講過，第一是因爲地球的自轉，第二是因爲地球的公轉，就是地球繞太陽周圍的運行。第一的效果是日出爲畫，日入爲夜，這該是有人類以來最早知道的知識。就是太古漁獵時代的人類，餓的時候，就去找東西吃，渴的時候，就去找水喝，太陽出來時候就去漁獵，下去時候就去休息，人類對於時間的觀念，只知道白天和晚上，就是只知道「日」而巳。但是第二的效果，成了四季氣候的變化，動植蟄伏昭蘇，生長，成熟，萌芽，凋枯的律令，這或者是人類試探了幾千年或者幾萬年纔能得到的知識。太陽的南北進退的一周期，我們現在呌做一年，和氣候有道樣不可逃的因果的關係，並不是一件容易得到的知識，得到這種眞確的知識，大概可以說是天文學對於人類第一次的大貢獻，人類生活旣然受了這兩種周期——日和年——的支配，那末爲他生活的安全和改進起見，就不能不順着天行規定了時間的叚落，做他生活的標準。尤其是進化到耕種時代的民族，年的知識和利用，就成爲生存上必不可缺的一件事。這就是日和年兩種周期成爲歷法上自然叚落的緣故。</p>
<p>但是每年的日數有三百六十多天，從頭數起，直至年尾，在古人看來大概是狠麻煩，不容易記得淸楚，並且人類生活一天比一天複雜起來，這種記法，漸漸覺得不方便，所以又在中間揷入一種折中的周期。這樣折中周期有兩種辦法。第一是取一種整齊的分叚，周而復始的數下去，譬如中國的甲子記日法，用六十天，爲一周，輪流下去，外國的星期法，七日一周輪流下去，都是這種辦法而且都是狠古的。第二是用一件看得見的天象來做一年的分叚，那末月亮的孜虧是最適宜的條件了。所以世界各國歷法的起源多半是含有陰歷的意味，就是這個原故。</p>
<p>所以歷是隨着人類生活進化的需要而發生的，他是規定年月日期分配的法則。他要適合於天象，更要謀社會需要的便利。從前歷法是以推步的精密爲重心，現在日月地球的運行周期，巳經知道狠淸楚，所以現在歷法不在乎推算的疏密，而在乎年月日周分配的調和。</p>
<p>我們巳經知道歷的要素是年，月，日。這三個要素的標準，年是以地球環繞太陽一周所需要的時間爲標準，月是以月亮環繞地球一周為標凖，日則以地球自轉一周爲標準，我們知道地球繞着太陽周圍而運行一周的日數，並不是整數，他是三百六十五日零四分之一日還差一點。而實用的年郤不能不包含整數的日數，這就已經是够我們編歷的麻煩了。如今又要挿入一種月的分叚，並且月的長度是以月亮繞着地球運行一周爲標凖，這個月亮繞行的長度又是二十九日有零，並不是一個整數的日數，一月旣不含整數的日數，一年又不是整數的月數，而要把他們調和起來，這就成爲一種複雜的問題了。我們中國古代天文學的目的，可以說就是要解决這個問題。</p>
<p>我們中國所用的曆法大概可以分做四期，第一是在漢武帝太初元年以前（公元紀元前一百零四年以前）所用的曆法，現在巳經不能得知其詳細。第二是漢太初以後至淸初（公元一千六百年左右）改曆曆法都有成文載於史志，雖改曆者有七十餘家，但原則都沒有變化，並且都是中國自己創造的曆法。第三是淸代的曆法，他是西洋的法數，以就舊曆的規模，就是中西合法時期。第四就是民國成立以後所改用的羅馬格勒哥里第十三所定的曆法，就是現在所呌做的國曆。（註一）我個人的意見，現行曆法，並不是我們中國自己所創造，以別人所造的曆法呌爲國曆，不甚妥適，不過中央黨部巳定名曰國曆，所以本人仍以國曆呼之。</p>
<p>上面已經說過漢太初以後至淸初止所用的曆法原則上都沒有變動。他們的原則是每年包含十二個太陰月，太陰月是照朔望定的。每月二十九天或者三十天，所以十二個月比一個太陽年三百六十五日有餘，還少了好幾天。這樣隔了數年後，等到差數滿了一個月，就把這年加上一個太陰月，名爲閏月。這年就有了十三個月，照大概的說，十九年內有七個閏月。他們的努力是要得到太陰和太陽準確的周期，以及怎樣安揷閏月的最妥當的辦法。</p>
<p>我們的舊曆，除了太陰月的分段以外還有二二十四節氣的分段法。本來應該說十二中氣和十二節氣，但是普通說話多混稱爲節氣了。上次講四季的變化時候，已經說過二十四節氣是按着太陽每年的位置而决定的。他們的分配是以立春爲一月節，雨水爲一月中，驚蟄爲二月節，春分爲二月中，如此再按淸明，穀雨，……等次序分爲三月節，三月中，……等等之。最後以小寒爲十二月節，大寒爲十二月中，這是已經很合科學化的辦法平心講起來，要比陽曆的月份合理得多。但是節氣只有曆法家來算定或用太陽的影長來測定，沒有月亮盈虧那麼顯著，大概比大陰月的辦法是很後起的。這種用太陰月和太陽年遷就調和的辦法，就是我們中國在革命以前用了幾千年的所謂『陰曆』，實在該說「陰陽合曆」這樣陰陽合曆有許多不便的地方。</p>
<p>第一　每年的日數沒有一定，可以相差到一個月。</p>
<p>第二每月的大小沒有一定。</p>
<p>第三每年的同月同日都不是相同的節氣，相差也可以到一個月。</p>
<p>而且這種種的不定，並沒有很簡單的法則，可以計算，所以舊曆的日月節氣都要檢查頒發的曆本，才可知道，因爲日月對於節氣的不固定，所以農夫種植不但要查某月大，某月小，而且也要查某日春分，某日淸明之類，至於按年按月的統計，如果要準確一點，在這種制度之下，至少是非常麻煩的。所以在辛亥革命成功之後，南京臨時政府就頒布改用陽曆。這在一方面是革除陰曆的麻煩，而一方面也是要從世界的大同，因爲現在世界各國大多數是用這陽曆的，世界的交通日繁，各種制度的世界化實在有很重要的意義。</p>
<p>舊曆的組成，上面巳經說過，至於現行的國曆，是怎樣的組成呢？簡單的說，他是破壞月法，就是他不以月亮繞地球運行一周的日期爲一個月，他只求年日整齊，硬把一年分爲十二個月罷了。所以他的月名，不過是實用上假用的名詞，並沒有學理上確實的意義，不過用以調和記時的方法，就是一年爲單位嫌他太長，一日爲單位又嫌太短，所以再用月的單位以調和之，再詳細一點說，他是</p>
<p>（一）一年分爲三百六十五日，門年爲三百六十六日。</p>
<p>（二）一年分爲十二個月。</p>
<p>（三），三，五，七，八，十，十二，等月各三十一日。</p>
<p>（四）四，六，九，十一，等月各三十日。</p>
<p>（五）平年二月二十八日，閏年二十九日。</p>
<p>（六）每四年閏一次，每一百年少閏一次，每四百年仍閏一次。（未完）</p>

<p>科學業談</p>
<h3>腦的發長得運用　中國科學社主編</h3>
<p>— 盧于道</p>
<p>一，靈機所在—腦</p>
<p>我們都知道人爲萬物之靈，靈機究竟在什麼地方？三百年前法國有位哲學家，名笛卡兒，他說靈魂在腦上一個小小松果體（Pinepb　Body）內，由松果體發出生機力，經過神經管而達到全體。到現在我們知道不然，我們的靈魂並不在這小小的松果體內，我們身體之動作亦不受此小小松果體之指揮。我們的靈機乃在頭壳內之腦上。現在似乎已成爲常識，腦爲我們行爲之主宰。</p>
<p>蒼蠅沒有什麼靈機，亦因爲它沒有腦子。它的腦只有像小米十分之一那麼大的幾個小神經節。在魚類就有一定的腦子了，例如鯉魚其腦子裝在頭壳裏面，但只有〇·九三克重。鷄又稍高一些，其腦有三·四克重。我們大概都承認，鷄是比魚聰明，爲什麽聰明？自然是因爲腦子較重而大。再看狗，能聽主人話，能守門，自然較鷄更聰明了，其腦重約一百克。我們人爲萬物之靈，人能征服自然界一切，其腦亦最重，約爲一千四百克左右。腦較人重之動物仍有，如象腦重四六六〇克，但是我們想象有這麽大，其身體面積較人大十一倍，而腦重只三倍，故以身體面積而言，象之腦比重爲二·八九，而人則爲九·四，在三倍以上。故人腦之發達，亦可想見。</p>
<p>美國阿海阿州克利扶蘭地方有位陶德敎授（Professor　T．Wingath　Todd），他從一九一三年起即仔細量人腦之容量。他說普通白人成人之腦量有1500c.c.但是在一九一三至一九一七年之間所得到窮苦人腦、其容量爲1480c.c.至一九一八年降至1410c.c.這是奇事恰巧那一年人民大多數去當兵作工，只有最無用者留下。在一九一九年歐戰停止之後，百業滯呆，軍隊遣散，社會上旣不能容納許多人，於是失業者增加。所得到窮苦人腦之平均達1520c.c.時社會上領袖皆預言明年社會之情狀可進步·果然一九二〇年腦之容量又降低到戰前情形。至次年（一九二一）一切實業又退步，其成績又昇至1550c.c.由此可見社會繁盛，所能得到之腦較小，因爲稍有能力者即能找到職業，留下來者祇腦量較小者。待社會上失業人多，乃有生存競爭之現象，腦子稍遜者皆窮困，即尋常人亦多失業，故以得到之腦容量亦較大。陶德敎授所搜得腦容量之高低，不啻社會上繁盛之風雨表。亦可知腦容量與知力之關係。</p>
<p>二，腦之各部</p>
<p>腦之最主要部分，是在頭壳裏面。頭壳好似一個國家的首都，一個機體好似一個國家。凡一個國家內的一切事變，皆能達到中央政府。在人體之週圍各處消息，亦都能傳逮至腦。其間即由許多神經作傳達路綫。故吾人之週身，凡毛髮之微，以及腑臟各處，皆有神經間接與腦相連絡。尋常在體之週圍與外界相接觸者，以及司機肉自主動作者，名曰腦脊系，而司腑臟各作用者曰交感系或自主系，後者因爲腑臟動作不能自主故名。我們可以命手指手臂動，但不能呌胃腸如何動或不動。但無論其爲腦脊系或交感系，其神經皆先經過脊椎骨內之脊髓（或曰脊腦）。此地爲中央神經系（或腦）之最低部分。總共人身上有三十一對神經走進脊髓</p>
<p>脊髓冉高一部，爲延髓或延腦。在我們頭壳之背面下部，司頭部感覺及動作之神經，除有五對神經外，巳有七對都到此地，從此地再向上面腦部走。同時由脊腦傳上來的神經通路，及由腦之上部發命令至身體週圍之路綫，亦經過此地。</p>
<p>再向上是小腦及腦橋，這二密切處相連。小腦的功用，具獨立性質，即司身體之平衡，及肌肉之調節。我們見朋友，握手不可太鬆，但亦不可太緊；母親抱小孩亦然，太鬆則小孩會脫手，太緊則小孩會窒斃，此皆由小腦調節之。又我們走路常是左右足互易向前進，當每一足提起時，另一足要支持住身體，如此二足交互支持平衡，亦小腦專司其職，使二腿之肌肉用力各得其宜。</p>
<p>由小腦腦橋再上去，則有一小節中腦，此地專司閃眼等視反應及聽反應。他所司之視反應及聽反應，皆爲不自覺的。故曰視聽反應中心。下等動物此地並不見得較人類差很多，反之若鷹其眼在它生命中佔很重要地位，因之視反應中心之腦部亦特別發達。</p>
<p>再往上一級爲丘腦或曰間腦，此地爲一切感覺所會萃之區，爲情緒中心，又爲司腑臟作用之中心。人類之一切喜怒哀樂，皆發自此地</p>
<p>腦之最高中心，乃在大腦二半球上。凡一切感覺皆來到此地，一切自主動作命令皆發自此地，一切思想創造，凡音樂家之編歌曲，科學家之新發明，亦皆由此地產生。人之靈於禽獸者在此，天才之靈於常人者亦在此。最妙處則在半球面上厚只3mm之灰質，此地全是神經細胞。總計此地有九十二萬萬細胞。人之首腦部，即在此九十二萬萬細胞之所在地。</p>
<p>腦之管理人體各部份動作，如政府之管理各地方，中央政府之下有省政府，省政府之下有縣政府，縣之下有區，區之下有鄉，鄉之下有村。人體之神經系，不啻一完備之政治組織。大抵脊腦司反應，延腦中腦司本能小腦司身體肌肉平衡，問腦司情緒，而大腦則司知慧。</p>
<p>三，腦功用之發長</p>
<p>以上所述，都是成人腦子，各部份之功用。凡動物由胚胎發長，以至成熟，身體各部皆逐漸長成，腦亦不能例外。故小孩之腦和成人之腦大不相同，其功用當然亦逐漸發長。</p>
<p>人體在胎內兩月後方具雛形。但三星期時心巳跳動，至第七星期胃腸消化管有蠕動。第四個月胸腹部能動。這些腑臟動作最先發生，即表示交感式自主神經系之功用先具。第六個月胎　若刺激其口舌，即會有吸吃反應。至第七個月各部分肌肉能有許多反應，如膝跳，足掌反應等。惟上肢腱反應，尚須待至生後才有。至第八第九個月，肌肉之反應　。普通在第四或第五個月時即能覺得。至將臨產的胎兒動得更顯。胎兒在母親體內非但能動，還能感覺。有一位母親臨盆前第三十一天，在浴缸內用溫水洗身，在浴缸旁邊有兩歲小孩在地上遊玩；偶而不愼手中小玻璃瓶擊着浴缸邊上，母親正躺着一些兒不覺得，體內之胎兒忽然一跳。此是見胞兒在腹內已能聽。以上是表腦脊神經系功用之逐漸發現。</p>
<p>非但生前之小兒如此，即生後其行動亦逐漸發展。初生小兒祇能躺而不能翻身，到第一個月能伙着舉首，第二個月能抬胸。到第三個月仰臥着時，能向某目的物舉手。到第四個月能扶着坐，到第五個月能坐在膝上拿玩具。至第六個月能坐椅子上玩。至第七個月能不加憑倚自己坐。第八個月能扶着立，第九個月自己傍椅而立。第十個月能爬。第十一個月即能率着手走路，第十二個月能自己推着家具立。第十三個月能爬上樓梯，第十四個月能自己立，第十五個月能自己走路。凡常態嬰兒，發育健全，大概其動作發長如此。以後學語學文，以至成人。</p>
<p>然而以上所述各積行動，其所牽及之腦部分，過於繁複。將腦組織之發長與行爲動作之發展相並研究的，在下等動物較爲完全。如貓，豚鼠，白鼠，　螺等。例如走路，其全個動作所包括之神經分子當然很多。但是最重要之中心爲小腦。山羊生下來時即能走，故此時若觀察其小腦皮層，亦巳充分發達。小狗生後三星期方能步行，故初生時小腦皮層尙未充分發達，到第三星期方發達完備。人則生後十五到十八月閒方能步行，在此十八個月間，亦可見到小腦皮層之逐漸長成。可見小腦發達和步行能力之關係。</p>
<p>在中央神經系中，擔任重要功用的，除神經中心外，還有聯絡各中心的神經通路；這些通路都是神經纖維組合而成。神經綫維上罩有一層鞘，名髓素鞘。髓素鞘的發達，各通路有先後。凡功用發達較早的，往往其通路之髓素鞘亦先發長；功用發達較晚者髓素鞘後發長。此亦可見神經組織與神經功用二者發長之相互關係。（未完）</p>

<h3>政制收革的途徑　（續）</h3>
<p>— 潘公展　（二十四年十一月於上海）</p>
<p>——謹獻於中國國民黨第五次全國代表大會諸同志和好談政制改革的先生們——</p>
<p>（一）政制改革必須以歷史的經騐和國民的習性爲根基。民主與獨裁一書的著者英人薩降（Hugh　Sellon）曾說過：「德國的過去歷史是　能使牠適宜於議會政治的。……日耳曼民族　專制政體頗有一種情感上的愛好，且就政治說來，牠是歐洲最爲柔順最易激動的民族；這些特性使牠不能適於民主政治，且使强有力的統治者成了必需的領袖。……故西方民主的統治之沒落於德國，最足證明全盤移植外國方式到另一國家的愚妄。」他又鄭重地指明：「每個國家的政治解放，都是發生於他自己的壤土，自己的民性，和自己歷史所稍累的經騐。」現在有些主張「全盤西化」的「學者」，恨不得把英國閱歷一千四百年經騐所得的英國的憲政，一旦移植於中土，於是一則說「一黨」專政不合民治，「黨治」必須取消，再則說「憲政是憲政的最好訓練」「訓政」大可結事束、殊不知「議會政治」下，政黨爭攘的風味，民國以來的歷史經驗，嘗之巳十餘年，而中國人民「撫我者后，虐我者仇」，「日山而出，日入而息，帝力於我何有哉！」的習性，數千年來又牢不可破，故欲導中國國民入於民治政制之一途，非憑藉於賢明的領袖，建國的政黨爲之師保不可·換言之，政制儘可改革，憲法儘可頒布，却萬不能冉走英美式多黨史迭的「議會政治」的老路，以自陷於波瀾重疊日暮途窮的政潮之中。</p>
<p>（二）政制改革必須以總理的遺敎和時代的需要為依據。中華民國爲總理所手創，建國大綱爲總理所手訂，三民主義爲建國的主義，五權憲法爲建國的機構，凡此種種，都是總理的遺敎，無論由軍政而訓政，由訓政而憲政，斟的損益以因時制官則可，根本蔑視以遷就流俗則不可。國民黨黨員旣是總理的忠實信徒，自當一心一德，貫澈始終。故反對三民主義　如果用革命的手段，打倒國民黨，然後毀棄一切總理的遺敎，置之不顧，則情猶可原；假使三民主義的信徒受了政制改革論的麻醉。沒有情細地考慮到如何去改革政制，而輕舉妄動，走入了背棄總理遺敎的路，則咎無可恕。「自古皆有死，民無信不立。」國民黨在目前這個艱危時局之中，除了恪奉總理遺教，本「天下爲公」之心，負「任勞任怨」之責，用示天下以大信而外，沒有別的方法可以求諒於國人，也沒有別的途徑可以拯救其國家。至於說到時代的需要，則凡稍稍研究政制的人，都知行政權力的强化實在是各國最近一致的趨勢，而尤合乎我國目前的環境。因爲在非常時期，處理國家大事，愼密果斷，缺一不可，如果仍抱着十八世紀十九卅紀防範行政首領專斷的陳腐觀念，一味想抬高立法權，使牠來牽制行政權，甚至使牠超越於行政權之上，以致行政首領縱有英才，行政組織縱是靈活，亦無從表現其政府的萬能，則在安內攘外救亡圖存的工作過程中，必使國家感受無形的損失。故在遵奉總理遺敎之範圍以內，依據時代的趨勢，强化行政機構的權力，實有百分之百的必要。（未完）</p>

<h3>小男兒（九六）</h3>
<p>— Louisa　M.　Alcott原著鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>「不，我巳把它留起，我原想這些必是你的什麽寳物，你很仔細把它們保存起來的，」蜀夫人說時就給他一個舊草帽，裏面裝滿了蝴蝶和甲蟲，一塊手帕包着一大堆一路拾來希奇古怪的東西。，鳥窠幾偭，外面用靑苔好好包着，奇異的介殼和石子，幾片的菌，還有幾個小蟹，因被覊囚而正在盛怒狀態之中的。</p>
<p>「我可以有什麼器具將這些傢伙放進去嗎？哈德先生和我找到了它們，它們是一等脚色，所以我願意把它們保存觀察起來；我可以嗎？」唐恩問道，忘了他的脚，看見蟹橫行牀上，覺得好笑。</p>
<p>「當然你可以的；博黎的老籠正好合用。我去拿來，留神不要讓它們箝了坦第的腳趾，」說着蜀夫人就去了，一面唐恩見得他的寳物未被被爲骯髒的廢物而致傾棄，也正欣喜不勝呢。</p>
<p>不久乃德，小橋，以及那籠子一同來了，蟹就遷居到這所新宅，童子們驚喜欲狂，他們在送　進屋時，也無絲毫恐懼之態。對於這幾個贊嘆的聽衆唐恩叙述俘獲他們的經過，更爲詳盡得多。然後他展開了那個包，將其中的品物一一加以說明，此時蜀夫人本已退入一個鄰室，以便他們可以自由閒談，可是聽到了實子們天眞的談話，不但驚奇，而且感覺得十分有趣。</p>

<h3>超短波振盪之方法</h3>
<p>— 崇齡</p>
<p>時至今日，超短波（Ultra-ShortWave）無綫電，雖猶在實騐期間內，而其進展的迅速，實足驚人；預料將來一般專家努力的結果，必能使超短波無綫電與短波無綫竄並駕齊驅，而尋得其新的用途。本篇所述，爲目前已吿實騐成功的三種超短波振盪的方式，介紹於此，以供初步研究超短波者參考之助。</p>
<p>尋常振盪管的振盪方式，因受高迪率產生的限制，自不能適用於產生極高週率的超短波。新的方式，終因專家的努力而吿初步成功了，計有（一）白漢生（Barkharsen）振盪，（二）磁塲控制管（Magnetron）振盪，及（三）二極管電子振盪等三種。茲分述於後。</p>
<p>（一）白漢生振盪白漢生振盪器爲白漢生氏所發明，係利用正柵負屏三極管（如圖）所示），於三極管的柵極加一百至二百的正壓，而屏極則接至數弗打負壓，以使三極管內發生電子振盪（Electronic　Oscillation），故白漢生振盪亦可稱之爲三極管電子振盪。其發生電子振盪的理由，可簡單解釋如下：管內絲極因熱而放射電子，因距離絲極頗近的柵極爲正壓，柵極絲極間幾無空間電子存在，故絲極所放射電子速度極高，立卽爲柵極所吸；其一部穿過柵隙的電子，爲屏極負壓所拒而折回，到達絲極附近時，又爲柵極所吸，衝出柵隙，復爲負屏所轉回，如此循環不息，遂生振盪，是爲電子振盪。其振盪週率視電子穿過柵極的速度而定，故與柵正壓屏負壓均有關係。如柵壓高達一百至二百弗打可產生三十公分至數公尺的超短波振盪。惟所生電力極小，效率也頗低。圖中所示ab二綫爲兩平行銅管，以爲超短波輸出的振盪電路，LL則爲兩高週率阻流圈。</p>
<p>（二）磁塲控制管振盪磁塲控制管爲一種二極管，其屏極爲圓筒形，其絲極爲綫條裝於圓筒內的圓軸地位；管外圍以通電流綫圈，使其磁塲方向與絲極平行。爲避免磁塲於圓屏上引起渦流損失（Eddy　Current　Loss），屏極常分爲兩部，使成爲兩個半圓筒，各接於正壓，見圖一一。磁塲的作用，在控制管內的電子運動。當無磁塲時，管內電子一如尋常二極管，由絲極射出，沿半徑直達屏極，如圖中a所示；有磁塲時，因磁塲與電子運動發生力的作用，（力的方向垂直於磁塲方向及電子運動方向）使電子沿曲綫而達屏極，如b所示；如將磁塲增强至某程度時，可使電子沿圓運動而折回絲極，不達屏極，如C所示。在這種C情形之下，便發生電子振盪。是故依照圖三的裝置，如將絲極電流與屏極電壓適當配値後，增加磁塲的强度，　（卽增加綫圖F的電流），至屏流爲零時，超短波振盪遂以發生，而由兩平行銅管TT的配諧電路輸出。</p>
<p>（三）二極管電子振蘯第三種振蘯，不用柵極，亦不用磁場，電子振蘯完全由一個特殊構造的二極管担任。這種二極管的構造與尋常不同，絲極爲圓筒形，屏極爲綫條，裝於圓中心，恰與上述二極管相反。絲極所放射電子，其速度有非沿半徑者，使電子繞屏軸生一動力，而使一部電子逃離屏極的吸引，來往運動，使生電子振盪。英人McPetrie氏近曾特製一二極管做這種試騐，其設備如圖四：管內屏極爲一鎢製約一公厘直徑的綫條，絲極亦爲鎢製，由四鎢絲繞於以屏爲軸約十二公厘半的圓圈上並聯而成；A與B爲兩平行長銅管，裝於屏絲間，D爲一約三〇公分直徑的圓銅盤，穿過AB兩綫，爲變更波長及替代阻流圈之用；C約爲一一〇MMF的變量電容器，亦爲變更週率之用。據其試騐的結果，屏壓加至約三六〇弗打時，可產生一公尺半的超短波，所產生振盪週率且甚穩定。滑動圓銅盤D，或變動電容器C，所產生週率在範圍內可以任意變動，D拉近眞空管時，週率因之增加，惟D不能過近於眞空管，如超過某點後則振盪停止，除非仍將D拉回後再漸漸拉近，則振盪不能恢復云。</p>
<h3>最近歐美之電視</h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>「電視」（Television），係繼「無綫電」而出者，目前雖尙談不到「發達」，但其前途希望頗屬不少，要之，現實最需研究之時期也。</p>
<p>電視之播送，數年前英美早巳行過，但因成續之未足令人滿意，故美國於去年卽行停止；英國雖仍繼續播送，但事實上早已成爲「彊弩之末」矣！按現英國之播送電視者，僅由英國播音協會一家行之，所用以播送之映像，甚形簡陋，僅三十綫者，朦朧不明，其難令人滿意，蓋亦意中事耳。</p>
<p>電視，與普通無綫電不同。普通無綫電，用如鑛石式若是簡單之收音機，亦可得到相當效果；但電視則反是，苟非播送機收像機均甚完備，則欲望獲得良好成績，殊非易事也。</p>
<p>現無綫電界對於電視之研究，表面上頗似一蹶不振，實則歐美諸國，現均相競研究，尤以美德二國爲盛。</p>
<p>對於電視之改良與研究，成績最着者，在美爲R．C．A．勝利（Victor）公司，在德則當推交通部當局及西門子（Seimens）。現美國R．C．A．勝利公司所播送之映像，已由一百二十綫改良增加至二百四十綫，故其所映出之像，頗形鮮明，宛如觀電影然。據聞此後擬更進一步改用三百六十綫者云。</p>
<p>現歐美諸電視專家，其研究焦點，殆集中下列諸點：</p>
<p>一，播送機中，有謂「膠片中介式」者。其法，先將所欲播送者攝成影片，而後連續將片上之像由播送機送出。此法之特點，乃膠片（Film）係物而非人，故播送時可任意照以强度之光綫，因之成績亦較可觀。惟旣多經一層手續與媒介，則映像不無變成朦朧之虞。</p>
<p>二，受像機，約可分爲二種：家庭用與大衆用者是。大衆用之受像機，亦以膠片爲媒介。其法，由播送機播出之電波，經受像機接得後，乃改爲電流而將像攝印於膠片上，再如電影之狀放映，映後之片，浸於溫水中，將片上之膠膜洗去，塗以感光膜，卽可重行使用矣</p>
<p>上述兩法，現正繼續研究中。</p>
<p>總之，最近歐美關於電視之研究，甚形進步，無論在技術上抑機械上，均已將近完成之境。然則電視之未能普遍者何也？其理由如下：</p>
<p>一，電視所用機械，至爲複雜，不若普通無綫電之簡單。就用戶而言，其所應備受像機，每具至少須美金三四百元。此其不易普及者一。</p>
<p>二，電視所用電波，和普通無綫電所用者不同，係一種超短波八公尺以下者。此種電波，不易遠達。據實騐結果，每一播送臺之播送範圍，僅七十哩而已。故欲使其能遠達各地，勢必投以鉅資而建設無數之播送臺與中繼所，始有可能。例如就R．C．A勝利公司所研究結果云，在美國權使電視能遍及全國，則非設立八十餘處之播送臺不可。此其不易普及者二。</p>
<p>三，電視播送機，價甚昂貴，遠出於無綫電播音機數倍之上，故欲於普通都市均設置播送機關，殊非易事。此其不易普遍者三。</p>
<p>四，電視播送上所需費用極鉅，故用戶所應負擔費用，實非資數。依美國R．C．A勝利公司所計算，用戶每年所應繳納之費，總需百金（美金）以上。試問當此經濟恐慌之際，欲由用戶徵收如此鉅額之收像費，果爲易事耶？此其不易普及者四。</p>
<p>總之，最近歐美諸國對於電視之研究，進步殊速，大有一日千里之概，技術方面與機械方面，均已將達完成之境，但距「實用」尙遠，欲望「普及」，更未可樂觀。惟以諾專家研究之勢心，成功當可拭目以待也！</p>
<h3>真空管各極電壓的供給（續）</h3>
<p>— 管廷鎭</p>
<p>燈絲或給熱物的電阻大小，在串聯時，亦應用歐姆氏定律來計算：需要電阻供給電壓—真空管規定電壓之和（歐姆）真空管規定電流</p>
<p>假使收音機用一只78號，一只77號一只43號及一25z5號接至一百二十弗打電燈綫上，則其串聯電阻等於一百二十弗打（供給電壓）减去六十二·六弗打（2×6.3弗打之和）被除〇·三安培（眞空管之規定電流），答數約爲一九一歐姆，電工率爲一百二十弗打减去六十二·六弗打乘以〇·三安培，答數約爲十七·二瓦特·購時應選擇瓦特數較大的電阻，倘串聯眞空管的規定電流不一，則其電流較小的眞空管之燈絲兩端，須接一電阻，使過量的電流通過，如此，串聯电阻的計算，須根據規定電流最大的眞空管了。</p>

<p>— 明襄</p>
<p>超短波是無綫電蘊埋的寳藏，亟待我們開掘，美國業餘家最定已有720哩通信的驚人成績，我國業餘研究同志，對超短波發生興趣者，定不在少數，然確經試騐而具相當成績者，殊屬難得。最近第六屆全運大會開幕，中央通訊社曾在會塲內，裝置五公呎超短波通話機多架，傳遞會塲消息，輕便淸晰，工作美滿，此次可稱超短波在我國付諸實用的第一遭。是機構造極簡單，收發兩用，其製作法以及試騐成績，在第二期實用無綫電雜誌內，詳細發表，讀者按圖索驥，包可以成功。全機所費亦殊經濟，連話筒聽筒電池全套，約四十元，此機卽日起陳列在本埠勞合路七十七號中雍無綫電機廠營業部廚實內，以供同志參觀云。</p>

<p>老鳥們對於剛孵化出來的小烏，白天飛來飛去捉小蟲給他喫，晚上和他一同睡在巢裏，那是多麽的愛護，溫存？可是只待小烏生齊了翅膀毛，自己會飛了，却就要分散開，各找各的小蟲來喫，再也不要老鳥給食與保護了！所以一個人，到了成人以後，倘再要靠着椿萱的庇蔭，不能自立，簡直連禽類還不如哩！</p>

<p>是日上午，在蘇州城內北寺塔報恩寺舉行公葬，故舊門生，遠近雲集，國民政府五院院長中央黨部等均派代表致祭，吳縣縣長及各機關當局，均躬予盛典，自上海來者，有柳亞子，馬公愚，朱少屏，等名流多人，姑蘇臺下，車水馬龍，報恩寺壁，滿縣輓聯，其最者如蔣委員長聯云：國尙多艱，神策奇謀思鄧禹，天何不憗，隻雞斗酒哭橋玄。汪精衛院長聯云：龍性世難馴，南社舊人推子健，鵬隅天所厄，吳江寒雨助余悲。吳稚暉中委聯云：建國負奇才，恨未持衡宰天下，詞壇推猛將，動能掃筆揚漢威。其餘美不勝收，難以悉記。先生之女公子綿祥女士有詩述哀云：鶚音毀室此何時，誓墓文成黯自悲，三載誰令爲淺厝，九原應是諒孤兒，敢云緩待瀧岡表，尙望人書有道碑，回首西縣橋畔路，秋來風雨正凄其，中郎有女不愧家學淵源，公祭旣畢，乃於下午二時在虎丘二山門西首墓地舉行公葬典禮，奏樂獻花讀祭文畢，赴葬者均致最敬禮，儀式極爲隆重莊嚴，從此虎丘山麓又增一勝蹟，永資後人之憑吊焉。</p>
<h3>拒毒宣傳與電影</h3>
<p>— 狂人</p>
<p>過去中國整個的影壇，除去若干比較說得上有一點意義的作品以外，充塞着的祇是緋色的氛圍，淫靡與享樂，麻醉着幾許靑年的男女。雖然在某種的環境之下，我們也不應該十分的苛責，應當原諒，但是著作者沒有相當的認識與覺悟，也是無可諱言的事實。</p>
<p>倘說電影並不是單純的娛樂，它應當負有敎育羣衆，改良社會的使命，是無可否認的話，那末，明星公司最近出品拒毒有聲偵探片「翡翠馬」。實在是應給予很高的估價的。本片雖不能說是怎樣盡善盡美的作品，但是確盡了一點電影的責任。</p>
<p>自從海禁一開，雅片大量輸入以後，瀰漫在我們全個民族裏的，幾乎到處是一片毒霧。上自通都大邑的達官貴人，下至窮鄉僻卷的販夫走卒，全都吸着，年老的，年輕的，男的，女的，田園財產，一切的一切，都給吸完了，全民族生存的前途，也給動搖起來。雖然不久以前，當局曾下了掃毒的决心，但是你能說在這禁令森嚴之下完全沒有毒物的存在嗎？帮助宣傳拒毒的責任，的確是電影界不能漠視的天職。徐欣夫先生抓住了當前這時代所需要的題材，攝製成這一部有聲偵探拒毒的「翡翠馬」。全劇的著重點並不是在吸毒者的如何懲辦，而注重於販毒及製毒機關的掃蕩，因爲這是毒物的營造廠。</p>
<h3>金魚談片</h3>
<p>— 良玉</p>
<p>中國藝魚社爲養魚同志所組織，發起人爲已故名導演鄭正秋先生及洗冠生陳渚深朱大可許和吳吉人不佞等初集議每月叙餐一次，漸謀社務之發展，不謂霹靂一聲，正秋先生作古，中堅吳吉人兄遽心灰意懶，卽叙餐亦爲停頓，惟陳朱許及不佞，固頗思振作，决勿墮中國藝魚社之令譽。</p>
<p>珍珠魚爲金魚中最珍貴之品，性殊嬌弱，動輒得病，海上蓄珠魚者，就不佞所過目者，爲次序如下，第一葉新福，第二邵鳳岐，第三周松齡，惟邵君近以冗於業務，無暇兼顧，以其全部精華，移交區區豢養，而以明春割讓魚子爲交換條件，是鄙人養魚史中之殊榮也。</p>
<p>上海魚塲之有珍珠魚者，共計三家，復爲評定次序如下，第一金魚樂園，第二上海金魚園，第三鱗社，此外殊不多見。</p>
<p>養魚專書，吾國殊感缺乏，上海金魚園主人許和，將出一金魚叢談，搜羅甚富，不倿「魚道」稿長約五千言，吳吉人兄亦有長稿一篇，此外譯自日本養魚專書者，亦不少，並附各種異品金魚銅圖數十幅，將來問世，魚迷宜人手一編，於養魚方法，得益當匪淺鮮。</p>
<p>金魚樂園主人以雄於資，搜羅名種獨多，上次假市立動物園舉行魚展後，更著美譽，社會局將於月之十五十六十七三天，在浦左舉行園藝會，特請金魚樂園將金魚送往陳列，聞該園主人業已復函遵行矣。</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>于是伊老人家便一聲不發，一動不動地靜坐着，眼睛雖然向前望着，但並不注視在那一件東西上面：我們雖知道伊是正在苦苦思索，但不知道伊是在想些什麽。因爲伊始終不會說過一句話，伊的雙手絕無動靜地擱在膝蓋上，臉是很緊張地扳着。</p>
<p>但伊的確是越顯得老起來了，比了昨天或是前天，至少相差十年左右；我不禁從內心上對伊發出一種憐憫的感覺，可是我不敢說什麽話去勸解伊啊！我祇見在我的面前，坐着一位很老很老的老太太，伊的座下是一張很舒適的黃緞的錦墩，但在伊的兩個老倦的肩膀上，却擔着一副關係全國安危的重擔。伊是被壓得多麽的勞苦啊！然而伊倒並不害怕，伊知道在目前，伊至少還有應付一切的手段，將來的事情怎樣，便不可知了；因此伊就不免很操心。但無論如何，全中國的人民都在守候着伊的動靜，伊遲早總得代表中國表示一些適當的態度的。</p>
<p>時辰鐘一分一刻地走過去，太后却依舊默默地靜坐着。</p>
<p>我在伊一旁侍立著，不覺也陪着伊思索起來了：我所想的是不知道伊老人家想不想收回伊今天所突然失去的一部份的靑春。（四五七）</p>
<p>世界珍聞</p>
<h3>日本的報紙</h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>日本的新聞事業，可以稱得一聲很發達了。如朝日日日兩報，差不多是日本報界的托辣斯，全國各地都有他們的分館。較大的縣份，便增加一版，專記地方新聞。所以各地的小報，都毫無生氣，這是和我國不同的地方。日本的報紙，每天分朝刊夕刊兩次，朝刊約十六頁，夕刊約四頁。起初看見日本報紙上寫着「今天共二十頁」，沒有不嚇的。後來才知道日本的一頁，等於我國的一面，所以每大二十頁，其實只有五張，論多少還不及我國呢。每種報紙每月大約一元左右，價格不貴，所以定閱的人多了。况且日本敎育普及，留心國事，五六十歲的老太婆可以說得出墨沙里尼希得拉是何等人物。我雖沒有見過黃包車夫在看報，但是停在路旁的汽車夫，不是看報便是看書，是常有的事情。</p>
<p>國外的電報新聞，大約佔據一面，市內新聞和每日評論也佔一面。其外有無綫電，商情，家庭，文藝等副刊。電報並不像我國樣子，好像都是一段一段的記事，大約由報館中整理過的。關於中國事情，很爲日人注目，差不多天天有幾項的。而對留日學生的生活讀書消息，是絕無的。本地新聞也和我國一樣都是自殺盜賊等記事，很大的標題，用素描的筆調將新聞染得和小說一樣。比較有價値的是一篇評論和川流不息的國外通訊。日本報紙的國外訪員，較我國爲多，所記載的事情，都是各國的重要實况，並不以各地人民風俗來敷衍的。</p>
<p>我覺得日本報紙的趣味第一在照片和漫書，各報館所收集的名人照片眞是堆積如山，每是一段重要新聞，一定將主要人物的照片，附在角上。而且連登聲天，可以天天式樣不同，有時附着漫畫寫眞，也是十分有趣。這種方法我國報紙還沒有，採用過。凡是和地理有關係的記事。便附着簡易小地圖，使讀者一目瞭然。我國各地的地圖，時常可在日本報紙上發見的。本地新聞裏照片更多了，各報館請着攝影記者坐着汽車，飛機出外採集着。無綫電，經濟新聞，電影新聞和我國相同，但是有時有幾篇理論著作，也很有價値的。</p>
<p>文藝的作品，只有半面大小，專是理論和抒情的東西。他們對象在乎介紹歐西文化，宣揚日本文藝。家庭副刋是婦女兒童的讀物，比較通俗而有趣。各報大都附有「相談所」，即讀者信箱，投寄的讀者，可以隱名。所以大都是討論婚姻戀愛家庭等問題。俗語謂，一淸官難斷家常事，」而各報編者，居然有問必答，倒是煞費苦心的。星期日上午有畫報，或是漫畫，或是各地的風景及生活狀况，佔據一頁。原來星期日也有夕刊，近來各報館巳會議取消了。</p>
<p>各報所載的談座，也很有奇趣的。譬如菊花談座，事先由報館發出請帖，邀了許多　菊專家，來參加茶話會。各人隨意談話，各抒宏論。到明天在報紙上發表出來，供給讀者，便成了紙上談話會了。此種談座，範圍很廣，分類又細。連女優明星的化妝方法，也可成爲談座資料的。各報館時常供大公司開各種展覽會或是招待讀者旅行遠足。有時報紙裏附送着電影戲院的優待券，於是讀者看了報紙以外，又可以享着各種意外的權利。</p>
<p>報館營業發達之後，設備當然完善。朝日日日兩報均用飛機運輸。東京的報紙的在淸晨六七時分派，而千葉縣報紙竟在晨四時前到達，這時讀者都在甜夢中呢。當京都大水時候，一天號外有五六張之多，差不多兩三小時即有一張。發號外的報販，身上掛着銅鈴，一面發一面跑，只要聽得鈴鈴之聲，住民自然的緊張起來了。街頭巷口的報攤，也都搖着一串銅鈴，和我國報販高呼「×報，××報」又是不同的。</p>
<p>畫展新訊　武進畫家趙安之，近開個人畫展於首都第一公園，出品二百餘幀，人物山水禽蟲莫不應有盡有，而仿宋布畫，尤具特色，趙氏之布畫，取法宋人，吾願作家藏家，盡量提倡，俾我國土布，身價從此十倍，若干年後，或將與宋錦相媲美云。</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十一回　婉轉依人過庭憐月貌激昂訓壻隔室聽獅聲</p>
<p>北海看到了月英這種樣子自然是臉色一動。月英自從嫁了賈多才以後，始終不曾和北海站得這樣的親近，而且眼面前就是賈多才站在這裏，相形之下，說不出是慚愧是悔恨，只覺這地面上有縫的話，自己一定把身子一蹲，鑽了進去。北海向他看了一眼，見他面皮紅中透紫，眼皮子都抬不起來，眼角上似乎還有兩在眼淚水流了出來。急忙的用手去握了嘴，發出兩聲不自然的輕咳嗽。再回頭看到他身前還站了一位太太，自己可不敢多看一秒鐘，立刻向後院鑽了去。到了後院以後，又不知道什麽原故，兩隻脚竟是不由人去指揮，已是停止下來。而跟着這個時候，第二個思想，便命令他回轉身來，於是他又踅到了墻角上，把身子藏在墻下，伸出頭來向前面過廳裏望着。事是那麼樣子凑巧，周太太和賈多才在說話，眼睛自不向別處張望。月英退後一步，斜側了身子，回頭向後面看了來。顯然的，是來看北海後影的，因之兩個人對看了一眼。月英這一度回頭看人，他自己在沒有這種用意。沒有這種用意，還回轉頭來，這是他自己所不可解的一件事了。這萬料不到北海不曾走開，依然還在這裏遲留着，這是他出乎意料以外的，在慚愧悔恨之外，又加着一分兒戚激。不但臉上發紅，而且心裏頭卜卜亂跳。（三六一）</p>

<h3>病原性微生體傳染之經路</h3>
<p>— 賈治中醫師譯</p>
<p>衛生體有二種。一爲最下等之植物。名曰黴菌。二爲最下等之動物。名曰原虫。凡有害於人體而染之卽發生疾病者。統稱之曰病原性微生體。其傳入人體之經路有二。茲扼要述之如下。</p>
<p>（一）由外膚侵入者！如破傷風菌，狂犬病菌，釀膿菌，百斯篤菌等。</p>
<p>（二）由內皮侵入者！如（甲）由食道腔而侵入之虎列拉菌，腸窒扶斯菌，赤痢菌，脾脫疽菌，結核菌，梅毒菌等。（乙）由氣管而侵入之結核菌，肺炎菌，猩紅熟菌，百斯篤菌等。（丙）由尿道而侵入之淋毒菌，梅毒菌，產蓐熱菌等。</p>

<h3>青春腺衰弱症之標本兼治法</h3>
<p>— 喬文彬醫師</p>
<p>靑春腺衰弱。變症最多。其最重大者。如遺精，早洩，腎萎，腰疼，未老先衰。如延不醫治。則各種衰弱症象。紛起雜乘。日困愁城矣。</p>
<p>治療之法。當標本兼施。希米脫氏固精片爲治遺精之專藥。其治標也。生殖素治早洩，腎萎，腰疼以及一切衰弱等症。其治本也。二者可以並服。交相爲用。但如無遺精症者。可專服生殖素一種。一日三次。每次二片。如兼患遺精者。則每晚臨睡前加服希米脫氏固精片二片可也。</p>
<p>此標本兼治之法。爲吾人臨床經騐之心得。凡患者儘可依法自行治療。以免延醫就診之有所未便也。</p>
<h3>胃健則體亦健說</h3>
<p>— 兪伯符醫師</p>
<p>胃臟爲人體各部給養之泉源。人體之强弱。一視營養之豐嗇爲轉移。凡胃弱者。則消化不良。食慾銳减。形成消瘦衰弱等樹種徵象。胃健者則胃口旺開。消化進展。營養充足。體重增加。肌肉飽滿。身壯體健。故注意衛生者。莫不以强健其胃臟爲先决問題也。</p>
<p>吾人臨診經騐。凡患急慢性胃炎及胃酸過多。胃痙等。胃擴張。胃弛緩。以及胃寒胃熟胃神經疼等症者。投以「胃痛靈」。輒應手而愈。其有胃弱。胃呆。食滯。便秘。消化不良。食慾减退等症者。則投用「健胃素」。莫不獲得最美滿之效果。此二劑者。一以治其疾。一以培其本。洵互相表裏之妙劑也。</p>

<p>中途雖聞掉期或低而漲　貼價步昂最後跌二元半</p>
<p>金市昨逢掉期之日、大戶旁觀居多、惟因事前怕測貼價或將爲六七元之說、中途一度回漲、不料開做後竟吿步昂、結果逐疲、晨初以海外銀市、英美俱平、蒙得里遠期銀價漲三厘七及縮二厘不等、滙兌略縮、倫敦生金跌一便士半、中央銀行掛牌揭曉、英美俱平、海關金單位勿動、標準標金價掛牌升爲一一四九元六角、但人心仍平、晨開低盤、開後大戶趁低納條而被拉上、惟銀行趁貴拋售、亦難再漲、美孚扒結近期美金、預悉滙豐掛牌、英平而美縮零六二五、此際上落不多、求供平衡、銀行胃口仍塞、遠期微硬而略挫、但以傳說本屆掉期、至多由空方貼進六七元之訊、人心一挺、激動買氣、美孚仍結美金、近其暗緊、逐步上漲、但大戶趁高陸續供給、不久又逐漸下游、預測印銀勿動、午刻大勢平穩、後市因掉期貼價步高、上塲由穩轉疲、開後雖略拉上、但因掉期愈貼愈高、逐漸不支、迨掉期正式開盤、升至空方貼進十二元八角、賣氣更熾而破四十元大關、買方趁低維持、掉期開後回跌、於是又復同上、但始終不能穿出四十二元外、最後仍因掉期助空而復疲、前途仍趨盤旋、至於本屆掉期、事前預測紛紜、迨下午預做、初喊多方貼出七八元之譜、難獲對手、正式開盤、竟升至十二元八角、巳合月息一分一厘餘、遂引起大戶之投資、退至十一元三角、無奈空方現貨頗多、買方難免擁擠、最後竟加至十三元以上、今將一天市况誌後、</p>

<h3>紗花　棉產估計激減　棉市愈覺堅硬　竟與紗市背馳</h3>
<p>棉市甚堅、與紗市適成反比例、良以美棉步騰、印棉亦步塵於後、外棉採算價繼長增高、於是日商對於華棉收買不絕、市價愈抽愈緊、銀行界購進、非但不出、反爲逢低搜羅加碼、多頭額午、均集中不放云、</p>
<p>鄭標又開高盤</p>

<h3>紗市壓力重重</h3>

<p>本年全國棉作、承十年之進展、植棉初期各省棉田仍有增多趨勢、詎下種時期、黃河流域如山東河南河北等省、亢旱不雨、致未能播種、或播種而未能發芽、或發芽而未能生長之廢田甚多、惟長江流域、尙稱良好、殆開花之期、魯豫等省旱象初解、而湖北忽吿水災、棉區被淹而成廢田者甚廣、據此次估計、本年全國廢田達一千二百二十九萬一千三百畝之多、爲有棉產統計之最高紀錄、棉作狀况、在第一次估計、各省冬佳、即被災區域、災後恢復茶速、故雖因災損田頗多、尙能產棉九百五十九萬六千餘担、平均每畝收量達二六·六斤、第一次佔計之後、黃河流域早災最重之山東河南兩省、因結鈴期間、氣候良好、頗有起色、妝量較第一次增加、河北無進退、惟山西陝西則陰雨减收、長江流域、多屬趨减、而以江浙最甚、向來江浙秋後最足以影響棉收之風潮、本年雖吿幸免、乃陰雨連綿、蟲害蔓延、致使在第一次估計時有豐稔希望之棉產、驟吿損减、全國棉產亦因之降爲八百三十九萬一千〇十八担、較第一次估計减少百分之一一·六、平均每畝收量亦降爲二三·六斤、</p>

<h3>為國際電台敬告五全大會海外代表諸君</h3>
<p>— 楨</p>
<p>舉世矚目之五全代表大會，已於本月十二日開幕於南京矣。各代表爲黨中堅，來自遐邇，本精誠團結共赴國難之旨，出席大會，宏謀偉論，必有以　吾人之望也。大會代表中有海外代表九十人，痛祖國之阽危，作母邦之省視，其意義殊重且大矣。自國難發生以來，國內各種建設事業，頗有成績，各代表偶加考察，自得其詳，吾人在電言電，謹以與海外僑胞關係密切之國祭電信事業，略爲陳之。</p>
<p>我國國際電信事業，五十年來，向歸外商水綫公司經營，不獨每歲出洋報費損失絕鉅，且主權旁落，握僑胞與國人通信之樞紐，尤爲政治上經濟上之損害。迨至民國十七年，我國府奠定南北，締造新邦，亟謀維護我對外通信主權之獨立，於是交通部建設國除無綫電臺於上海，經八年之努力，先後成立下列直達通報之電路：　（一）中美路　與舊金山美國無綫電合組公司直接通報，並由該公司電臺及西聯電報公司接轉南北美洲各地電報。</p>
<p>（二）中美路　與舊金山馬凱公司電臺直接通報，並由該公司電臺及郵電公司接轉南北美洲各地電報。</p>
<p>（三）中德路　與柏林德國郵電部無綫電臺直接通達德國各地，並接轉歐洲菲洲各地電報。</p>
<p>（四）中法路　與巴黎法國無綫電公司電臺直接通達法國各地，並接哋歐洲非洲各地電報。</p>
<p>（五）中俄路　與莫斯科蘇俄交通委員會無綫電臺直接通達全俄各地。</p>
<p>（六）中瑞路　與日內瓦瑞士無綫電公司電臺直接通達瑞士各地。</p>
<p>（七）中英路　與倫敦皇家交通公司無綫電臺直接通達全英各地，並接轉歐洲其他各國及英屬非洲印度澳洲各地電報。</p>
<p>（八）中菲路　與馬尼刺美國無綫電合組公司電臺直接通達全菲各地，並接轉美洲及暹羅各處電報。</p>
<p>（九）中越路　與西貢越南郵電總局無綫電臺直接通達越南各地。</p>
<p>（十）中荷路　與巴達維亞荷屬東印度無綫電臺直接通達爪哇各地，並接轉荷蘭澳洲印度南洋等處電報。</p>
<p>（十一）中日路　與東京日本無綫電信株式會社電臺直接通達日本各地。</p>
<p>（十二）滬港路　與香港郵政總局無綫電臺直接通達。</p>
<p>（十三）中意路　與意國羅馬無綫電臺直接通達意國各地。</p>
<p>上項電路，作者不憚縷陳，並說明直接通達地方者，因代表諸君身居外國，對於祖國之通信事業及其電路，容或有未知或知而未盡之處也。若經闡明，吾知代表諸君愛國心切，歸去勸導各地僑胞，所有發來祖國電報，每電底之備註欄內，必註明Via　Radio　Via　Anten（經國際臺）字樣，而爲愛護祖國之標幟矣。</p>
<p>抑有言者；國際電臺在過去八年中，全體人員，莫不奮勉從事，對於傳遞電報之迅速與準確，均造成最高紀錄。例如上海發至紐約電報最高速度，僅需四分鐘，上滄發至香港馬尼刺等處電報最高速度，僅須一二分鐘。至錯誤之發現，更屬絕少，據統計所得，二十二年份該臺來去電報總數錯誤經收報人聲訴後，查明係該臺錯誤者，僅百分之一二·七。國際電臺辦理如此完善，後經各局臺之努力，設法招徠，業務遂日趨發展。二十年來去報字數計二，九二二，二六八字，二十一年增爲三，六五〇，六七四宇，二十二年增爲四，〇二八，四六〇字二十三年因中英中日兩路之開放，業務較之往年，尤有雄飛突進之勢。每月電報達五萬次，七址餘萬字，駸駸與經營數十年外商水綫公司並駕齊驅焉。</p>
<p>自轔際電臺成立後，我國國際通信，得以恢復自由，換言之，海外僑胞與祖國之關係，不啻加强加密。現祖國各種建設事業，求助於僑胞者正殷，希望海外代表諸君，將國際電臺建設之成績，轉達於各地僑胞，俾僑胞瞭然該臺內容，發電時而知有所擇，則幸甚矣。至該臺建築之宏偉，機械之新頴，服務之週到，代表諸君過滬時，如往參觀，該臺當竭誠招待也。</p>

<h3>擁護新幣制</h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>霹靂一聲，新幣制政第，竟於本月四日起由財政部通令實行矣！關於新幣制政策施行，對於吾國經濟前途之利益以及實施之各項原因，早經財政當局和經濟專家劃切述明本刋不必再贅。總之，此項政策，行之得法，實爲吾國經濟的復興最完善之方法。</p>
<p>至淤吾電信界，對此新政策之實現，另有幾種感想：第一，吾人歷來感覺不便者　，就是幣詞太複雜，硬幣且不必說，卽紙幣亦往往一地有數十種之多，使人難於記憶辨別。有時發行紙幣銀行雖已倒閉，而紙幣仍未絕跡市塲；有時銀行雖在營業，而因該行不甚著名之故，對於所發行之鈔票發生懷疑。因此之故，電局與公衆找付或收納電報費，常會引起許多無謂的糾紛。至於使用硬幣，亦往往會因成色之高低，眞僞之混雜，而同樣發生許多誤會。現在，硬幣既禁止行使，而紙幣亦祇規定以中·中·交·三家者爲法幣，其條各行紙幣，雖准暫時流通，但須逐漸換回。行見最近將來，市面上的各式雜幣，卽可肅淸，祇有三大銀行紙幣流通。電局與公衆間今後因貨幣而發生之爭論，必可减少到極低度，甚至於無。</p>
<p>第二，以前硬幣之鼓鑄，因各省省自爲政之故，大都自由鼓鑄，因之成色低落，不足法定標準，例如，珠江流域流行之毫洋，四川省區內通行之川洋，均因成色不足，不能十足行使。前者用時需打折扣，不能照幣面計値。且早晚幣價不同，電局折合大洋訐算報費，因此發生許多困難。有時因一日之間，漲落過甚，損失不貲。後者在川省境內雖可十足行使，但省外匯兌，有時須貼水百分之四十以上，而各項電信機械和材料，均須以十足現洋購辦，故川省境內之電信營業收入，無異打個六折。此等情形對於電政經濟影響非常之大，足以阻礙電信事業之發展。現在法幣旣已實行各種雜幣自須逐漸牧回，毫無疑義。行見全國幣價統，再無高低不同之別，而電政牧入自亦不致再受此項損失。</p>
<p>第三，此外我們再感到一種普遍的困難，就是報　找零。因爲各種貨幣價値不固定，與時常變動之故，電局營業處，必須每日將銀錢行市掛牌公吿。同時因爲法定的「厘」「分」「角」各項十進輔幣，尙未正式鼓　發行，找出兌進數目，難斯準確，因此發報人與電報局之間，總不免要有一方面受些損失。所以有幾處電局爲使雙方各無損失，且爲辦事，便利起見，大都利用郵票找零。但郵票一經着汚，便難使用。故此項辦法，未能爲每個發電人所歡迎。所以根本的解决方法，仍是在於迅速鼓鑄法定的標準輔幣。聞財政當局此次爲澈底貫澈新幣制政策計，已飭令造幣廠開始鼓鑄五厘。一分·二分五厘·五分之銅幣，及一角·二角·五角·之鎳幣，以後便以此種法定輔幣，行使市面，將現在流行市面之不合法定標準的銅銀質雜幣一律逐漸收回，吾人希望財部早日實現此項辦法，使電信機關再無掛牌公吿銀錢行市，同時减除一切無謂的麻煩。</p>
<p>所以新幣制政策之實行，凡我電信界同人，應絕對擁謎。</p>
<p>（五）我國電政現正力謀改善</p>
<p>近年以來，我國交通當局，對於電政一項，實已改變不少，如有無綫電之歸併，電局與郵局之合設，新式克特電報機器之裝置，及其他種種之新設施，均足以增加電報傳遞之速率，而予民衆以充分之便利，記者深信國事漸趨安定，各業平均發展，社會需要電報愈多，電局設備必益完全，反之若人民不需用電報，局台業務不能發展，則交通當局雖竭力改善，亦豐勞而無益，不能達到福國利民之目的。</p>
<p>世人每以爲我國電報價目太昻，不能普及於民衆，此說或亦有若干理由，惟報價減低以後人民發寄電報之心理，恐仍不能增加，如此一方面收入減少，一方面報務不多，則財政上發生重大問題，支撐維持更感困難，目下所希望者，厥爲國內交通發達，各種事業進展，先造成一流動活潑之社會，以增加發寄電報之原動力，次則人民利用電報之習慣，亦須漸漸養成，如此各方並進，事實兼顧，我信交通當局必能斟酌情形，統盤籌劃，而設法減低電報之價目，以謀進一步之普及。</p>
<p>（五）望各方面共同合作</p>
<p>電報交通，與國家人民，均有極大關係，在外國無論為商辦或官營，人民對之，均竭力加以維護，善意督促，我國現在所有電報情形，在管理設備及機器方面，雖不及外國之完善精良，然大致已具有規模，苟若假以時日及良好環境，則改善設備，添裝新機，不難與外國並駕齊驅，因此深望全國各界，共同合作，善意輔助，電報事業之發達，直接足以促各種事業之進展，間接可提高國家民族之地位，至若便科民衆通訊，聯絡各界情感，其關係尙覺爲小也。</p>

<h3>英美等國電報情形及其發達原因（續）</h3>
<p>— 李季淸</p>
<p>（三）英美等國電報發達之原因</p>
<p>英美等國之電報事業，固極發達，然其所以能發達亦有種種之原因，記者游歷各處，詳爲觀察，知其原因甚多，撮述數種如左：</p>
<p>（一）交通便利英美等國之交通運輸，極爲便利，空中有飛機，陸上有火車，水面有輪船，此外公路四通八達，汽車往來如織，因此人民及社會一切事物，日夜常在活動，此種活動之結果，社會情形，人事往來，遂成爲異常複雜，而傳遞消息之電報，卽隨之增加甚多，我國鐵道不多，公路尤少，飛航事業，尙未普遍，海河交通，亦見發達，因此各地人民，久居一處，苟無急要事務，向不出門遠行，生活旣極靜寂，人事遂趨簡單，消息傳遞，無時間性，電報之需要，斯不重大矣，近年以來，國內鐵路增加，公路發達，社會活動之程度，日漸提高，需要電報之處，亦必加多，此誠良好之現象也。</p>
<p>（二）工商業興盛美英等國各處，均有大規模之工廠，製造種種日用物品，其經營商業之範圍，類多遍及世界各處，工商業發達，共推銷定貨及運輸接洽等事，均須賴電報便利，以求迅速，而利業務，電報往來，由此增加，各電報公司遂皆日夜工作，力謀傳遞之迅捷。</p>
<p>（三）人民能利用英美人民極能利用電報，除辦理正當事務，當然發寄電報，傳遞消息外，對於旅行娛樂及普通交際事情，亦多盡量利用電報，出外旅行，每將出發及到達情形發電報吿家人親友，婚喪喜慶，發電表示賀唁，若逢佳節，互發電報祝賀，此外各種集會及劇團獻技等，各方有關係人物，亦多以電報表示情意，共利用電報，眞可謂無微不至，以視我國社會非有念事不發電報，及見電報心生恐慌之情景，實覺大大不同。英美等國人之善於利用電報，並不僅因電報價目之不貴，蓋實因有多發電報之習慣所致，至共電報價目，記者細加研究，覺以彼等每月所入薪貲作此較，亦並不廉於我國。我國現行之交際電報價目，似極低廉，合之美金僅一角餘，合之英幣，約爲七便士，實與英美報價相似也。</p>
<p>（四）文字簡易英美等國電報之發達，得力於文字之簡易者甚多，英美德法等國文字，均脫胎於二十餘之字母，能說卽能寫，應用極爲簡便，且現代傳遞電報之方式，均用打字機式之收發報機，甲處用打字機方法將電報在機器上發出，乙處在打字機式報機上照樣收到，卽可閱讀，有時發報人並可自行運用此項機器打發電報，與收報人直接辦理，不必經過電報局之代辦，此種便利我國人似不能享受，蓋因文字複雜，方言繁多，電文必先譯成號碼，然後再譯電文，如此手續繁多，在收發報人固覺不便，而在電局方而亦感種種困難也，我國電局現亦裝有與英美電報公司相同之新式電報機器，然因我國文字無彼等之簡易，故似不能得到最高之效用。交通部現正派員研究國語電報方法，將來施行以後，必可予收發電報民衆以極大之便利。在海外讀國內報紙，悉敎育部現正推行簡字辨法，國內有使文字簡化之運動，洵屬大可欣喜之事也，我國各種事業進步遲緩，由於文字方言之複雜，亦爲極大原因，電報辦理之不能十分敏捷，與此事確有重大關係。</p>
<p>（五）我冗長官軍通電</p>
<p>美國商辦之各電報公司及英國官辦之郵電總局，對於每一電報，均照章收費官報半價，商報全費，收發一通電報，有一通電報之收入，官報記賬不付，，或僅收取材料費之辦法，均絕對無有官報，無論明語或密碼，均頗賅要簡短虛字極少，我國官軍電報，則每多駢文客套或涉及私事，有時通的全國各處，遍送不需要機關，電前且加註「十萬火急」，限卽刻到」等字樣，此種情形，出於秘書先生一時高興，隨意增添，而對於電局方面則擁塞綫路，妨碍商電，增加手續，實有極大之不利，此在外國辦理電報事務人員心目中實萬萬夢想不到有此種奇突情形之存在也。英美電報公司有電報，卽有收入，有收入即可力謀發展，其報務發達，實坐此故。</p>
<h3>用戶因接綫引起種種誤會</h3>
<p>— 葉林生講</p>
<p>此篇係葉君在吳縣廣潘臺所講，關於用戶種種誤會，說得中肯，本刋樂爲發表，凡便用電話人士，請抽閒一閱爲盼！編者識</p>
<p>諸位用戶，以及電話的人士們：今天我來報告一件很重要的電信常識，就是諸位有時使用電話，覺得不利便的時候，——尤其在黃霉天，在諸位的意思，也許認爲是話局接綫人員放棄了職守，而跟用戶爲難，這種事實的發生，固然不能說完全沒有，也不敢說司機生一定必無過失。但是諸位要知道，話局的司機生—卽接綫人員—他們在領班班長時時刻刻嚴厲監察之下，假使有故意過犯規章等事，一定要受到嚴重的處罰，决不寬恕的；所以「有意跟用戶爲難」，這句話恐怕理論上雖有，而事實上不會有的。根據統計，凡關於用戶質問的報吿，十分之八九，起因於雙方的誤會，因此，有解釋這誤會的必要。換句話說，有使諸位用戶明白誤會原因的必要</p>
<p>現在把各種阻碍，以及用戶發生誤會的原因，用分晰方法，明自報吿一下</p>
<p>第一種　局中不能答的原因</p>
<p>（一）兩綫相連或中斷；</p>
<p>（二）用戶話機發生障碍，或局中總機發生降碍，以致號燈不亮。</p>
<p>「註」共電式總機，每個用戶，均有號燈一盞。</p>
<p>諸位要知道，打電話時局中不來應答，不外此病，並非司機生故意不理，應請由附近電話或信件通知話局，以便隨時派匠來修。</p>
<p>第二種　應答遲慢的原因</p>
<p>（一）共電式交換總機，每個司機生，平均管理到二百四十餘戶，用戶同時要號常常有到十餘戶，司機生是不能够同時答應的他們要挨次應答，所以接到最末一戶，就難免稍爲長久了！</p>
<p>第三種　錯誤號數及名稱</p>
<p>（一）各處口音不同，司機生誤聽，如一七四十二等音，最容易聽錯。</p>
<p>（二）用戶不翻看號簿，及每月所送的號數更正單，所報之號碼，已經另換他家，司機生依照所報接綫，但用戶却認爲接錯了。</p>
<p>第四種　通話中斷</p>
<p>（一）用戶說話的時候，總機上的塞繩，忽然發生毛病，有的街上綫路，忽被風吹斷吹碰，這樣一來，說話當然要中斷了。</p>
<p>用戶呌號雖畢，但被呌的沒有來，或找人未來，照理是不能掛上聽筒的，如果在這時候，有一方而將聽筒掛上了，掛上聽筒，卽是話終的信號，司機生看見用戶已經有了終話的表示，自必拆去此用戶，這時講話的另一方面用戶一定要疑心司機生搗亂，誰又知道司機生是在代人受過呢？</p>
<p>（三）用戶有裝分機的，分機正在通話的時候，同時正機亦要打電話，一不留心扳閘扳過，於是乎分機上說話的人，話沒有完就聽不見了。　第五種用戶叫號不來或答話遲慢</p>
<p>（一）綫路有了障碍，振鈴電流通不過去，電鈴就要不響。</p>
<p>（二）用戶電話，大都沒有專人看守着的，有時主人出外，將電話室的門餓去，那時就使鈴響，也沒有人去接。</p>
<p>第六種　共他種種誤會</p>
<p>（一）雙方用戶在談話之際，有一方面偶不應答，誤爲局中把綫拆斷了！</p>
<p>（二）被喚的一方面，聽見鈴響，摘下話筒未及講話，這時忽然與人談笑或旁邊有人謾駡，被要號人家聽見，以爲司機生罵人。</p>
<p>（三）被喚家機綫障碍，經局中回復「綫壞哉」，這時該損壞用戶適已修好，或在這時被風吹開，要號人家得知，一定疑心司機生搗亂。</p>
<p>（四）用戶所要之號，往往因與他戶說話，不能卽時接上，在用戶料想，以爲司機生有意搪塞，不知交換愈忙，因用戶在說話，而不能接上的也愈多，並非司機生有意搪塞。因爲司機生每接一綫，毫不費力，若以「有人叫」「綫不空」等語搪塞用戶，用戶勢必覆要此號，至再至二，結果還是要接通爲止，這樣豈不是愈搪塞愈多事？</p>
<p>總而言之：以後如有接綫不利便的時候，諸位儘管分別通知話局，話局一定竭誠接受，查明眞相，有圓滿的答覆不過在事實未明白以前，諸位萬萬勿武斷，以為「這是司機生搗亂」，或「某電話局不好」，因為在事實尙水查明解決之前，所下斷語，是用戶們一方面的猜疑和誤會。現在話局與各用戶間所需要的，是誠意的合作，而不可有猜疑和誤會，一生誤會，就要影響到國營交通事業的發達了！</p>
<h3>談談電文的標準書寫</h3>
<p>— 王珩鋆</p>
<p>關於電報的書寫法，本來不限定什麼格式，主要的條件就是「淸楚」。但是設果能夠書寫合乎標準一些，對於增加電報的速率，並且給予電局工作人員帮忙不少。書寫電報的標準格式很簡單，很容易辦，旣便利自己，又適宜他人的兩全其美的辦法，我想拍發電報諸君，一定是很樂意辦的。</p>
<p>拍發電報所用文字，分爲兩種，一　種是洋文電報，一種是華文電報；洋文電報不論明碼密碼，只要謄寫淸楚，或是用打字抄在紙上，就可以說是很完善的格式：華文電報因爲要翻譯成數目字，所以比較　一些手續。華文密碼電報，是用四個或五個數目字爲一組，按照着發報人另編的密碼本組合而成的，所以必須由發報人自己譯成數目字拍發。至於華文明碼電報，是限定要按照交通部所公佈的明密碼電報新編上面所載明的電碼翻譯而成，並且電文的意義，還要連賃成文的。發報人可以自己按照電碼新編自譯，也可以只寫出中國字請電報局代譯，不過這種自己譯的明碼電報，必須要將原來的文字註在電碼的旁邊，電報局的收報人員，可以代替發報人核對他所翻譯的是否錯誤。因爲他們有代爲改正錯誤，和核校電文的責任。關於這一種自譯明碼電報，註出原電文字一層，有人以爲這是多一番手續，實際上確是不然，因爲反正拍發電報，總是要先寫出電稿，然後纔能翻譯，那麽就把電報稿寫的鬆散一些，把電碼譯在每一個字的下面，豈不更較省事，更較便當。而且保險這張電報的譯碼，絕對的沒有錯誤。</p>
<p>書寫電報的紙張，電報局預備有很精緻適用的發電紙，上面印的有發電的格式，和發電的簡章，凡是拍發電報的人，可以到各電報局，或電報收發處去索用，不取費用。如果有不用電報局發的紙張的，也可以任便，但是最好要由左向右橫寫，這是書寫電報的慣例，如果是依照這種慣例由左向右橫寫的電報，電報局的經手人員可以很不猶疑的就拍發出去，使你的電報增加不少的速度。反之如果這電報是由右向左寫的，或是由上往下直寫的，那就不大合乎標準，雖然也是一樣的可以收發，一樣不會延悞，但是經手的人員就不能不順便讀讀，因爲這種寫法不是習慣的次序。所以書寫電報的時候，要後左向右橫寫，這是標準的寫法。</p>
<h3>拍發匯款電報的一個保障</h3>
<p>— 葆眞</p>
<p>歐美各國國家或私人所設銀行，對於明語匯欵電報，爲杜絕奸宄之徒，假借名義發電偽習圖騙起見，大都互相預先約定一個密碼對號字（Check　Word）或對號數目（CheckNurnber），由發電之銀行，書於匯欵電報電文之前。收報之銀行收到該項電報後，須將來電電文前所用之密碼對號字或對號數目，加以核對，以免被人僞胃圖騙匯欵，法至善也。國際電報規則內亦曾規定；「銀行電報曁與其相類之電報內，如其電文前含有密碼對號字或對號數目者，仍作為明語電報」。我國電局對於本國或外商銀行所發洋文明語電報，向准採用密碼對號字或對號數目。惟對於華文明語電報，尙無此項規定。直至二十三年八月間各電報局始奉到交通部命令規定，自二十三年九月一日起，銀行或錢業所發華文明語匯欵電報之電文，首端或末尾，亦准採用密碼對號字及表示發電日期號數之阿拉伯數目字各一個，以杜僞冒。所有該項對號字·數目字·及其他電文各字，均仍按華文明語電報價目收費。茲聞此項規定，業已刊入現行國內電報營業通則內，作為一種定例。</p>
<p>拍發匯款電報者，雖以銀行或錢業為多數，但其他商行因與外埠素有商業銀錢往來之商行互相匯劃欵項，往往亦需用電報，以期迅捷。例如，「漢口民生路亞浦耳電器公司—速付　昌莊（500。）元中央銀行（7200）元總廠銑」，其性質與匯欵電報無異，關於銀錢出入甚鉅，亦殊有加註上述密碼對號字之必要。茲悉交通部對於各商行因匯劃欵項而發之華文明語電報，亦已准予援照銀行及錢業電報例，在電文首端或末尾採用密碼對號字及表示發電日期號數之阿拉伯數目字各一個，從此各商行拍發匯欵電報，可以得到一個穩妥保障。至於個人所發匯欵電報，可由發報人與收報人事先互相約定一字作爲發報人看名，其功用亦可與密碼對號字相埒。電局對於發報人着名所用之字，本無限制，償可由發報人任揮一字也。</p>
<p>其次，關於密碼對號字及日期號數之書寫方法，茲特略爲一述如次。查洋文明語電報內之對號字或對號數目所含字母或數目字，按照國際電報規則第六章第二十條第一節第三項及洋文電報書寫及計費辦法第六條庚項之規定，至多以五個爲限。至華文明語電報內之密碼對號字，則限用四碼，例如（9717）又按照現行國內電報營業通則第五十四條乙項之規定，上述對號字及日期號數必須書於括孤之內，（括弧符號免予計費）並於其後各加一「號」字。但中間並無其他文字或數目間隔者，僅須於第二括弧後加以一「號」字，例如（9717）（1601）號。故此項連用之對號字及日期號數不宜分開書寫，如連續書於電文首端或末尾者，可省用一「號」字，减少一字報費也。（完）</p>
<h3>交通部電信機械修造所參觀記</h3>
<p>— 驊</p>
<p>—出品精良，售價低廉—</p>
<p>交通部電信機械修造所，是交通部出資創辦的惟一製造電報和電話機械的機關，也是國內供給電信機械唯一的工廠，它的規模和設備，雖然比較國內機器工業中並不怎樣偉大，但是因爲內部管理的和製造技術的猛進，所以它的出品，非但供給交通部所轄機關應用，國內各重要鐵路所需的電報機械，也爭相定購。記者日前適因公便，得參觀該所工塲的全部，用敢略述一二，介紹讀者：</p>
<p>一副機械的製造，我們知道要經過製圖木工·鑄工·鍛工·鉗工·車工·裝配和試騐等等繁複的工作，修造所內製造機械的程序，除了鑄工一部份工作交由當地翻砂工塲承辦外，其餘都是該所自己經手的。就我們參觀到的有製造工塲電鍍工塲·噴漆工塲·和電木工塲·製造工塲中有（一）木工間，（二）鉗床間，（三）車床間，（四）乘床間，（五）鑽床間，（六）銃床間，（七）洗床間，（八）淬火間，和（九）裝配間。工人們都很忙碌地工作著。機車轆轆的聲音，震耳欲聾，顯示著工作的緊張。</p>
<p>據該所林工程師棟臣先生吿訢我們：「本所雖然是一個交通部的附屬機關，但是經濟上完全自給，交通部不過出一筆開辦的基金罷了！本所經幾年來上下同人戮力的結果，現在總算得了相當的基礎。可是本所經費究屬有限，一切還待當局的維護與擴充。本所的職員都是國內著名大學和專門學校機械工程方面的畢業生，雖然待遇方面因爲本所經費關係異常菲薄，可是他們耐勞和辦事的能力，都有優異的成績，值得我們稱道。本所對於工人方面的管理，注重技能和精神的訓練，使每一個工人都有良好的品性，和優良的援術。本所有籃球塲設備，供給工人們鍜練體魄，每天晚上，工人們並須受兩小時課，由本所職員指導。工人們在這樣良好的薰陶之中，對於本所生產方面，當然有很大的帮助。這兩年來本所營業方面，當然交通部是我們的最火主顧，但是現在各大鐵路所用的電報機械，由本所供給的，也很不少。本所工作機械方面，雖然幾年來增加了不少，但是因爲營業擴充，覺得還嫌不够，現正積極加以擴充，以應實際的需要。本所經理舒震東先生是商務印書館舒式華文打字機發明家，對於機械方面，具有極深的根基和濃厚的興趣，所以舒先生雖然兼任首都電話局長，公務很忙，但是每天下午必定到修造所來親自督率，本所得有今日的地位當然是舒經理給予的助力。一</p>
<p>記者聽了上面林工程師的談話和參觀了修造所內部的工塲覺得異常滿意。亟需筆記之，以實本刋。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>所希望於中國婦女</h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>阿京電：八日羣衆要求阿皇，獎賞希勃里流域，援助丈夫抵抗意軍之婦女三人，其中二人，於意軍砲火下，爬行一小時，以軍火接濟前綫機槍隊，至彈盡援絕始退，第三婦女，則指揮兵士五人，盡力固守前哨戰壕，並使五人安然面退。</p>
<p>婦女在今日社會上所處地位，十分電要。社會工作需要婦女努力，政治工作需要婦女參加，卽軍事工作，亦需要婦女帮助，在目前這個非常時代，是無從否認的。</p>
<p>但是返顧我國婦女的情形是怎樣呢？大多數舊式婦女不要說，她們巳成爲封建勢力下的俘虜。且她們旣沒有幸福受敎育，又少有參加社會工作的機會。這種婦女，與其說她們放棄對社會的責任，毋寗謂社會拒絕她們的供獻。至一部份新時代婦女，雖則已感染歐美思想，有的還甘心做男子的玩物，有的賢妻良母，仍爲她們努力最高的目標。目前亦正有不少人要將她們趕回廚房去。尙有幾個自稱爲有覺悟的婦女，她們又只知致力於男女平等權的爭取。要求獻身社會，代社會盡義務的，實甚罕見。</p>
<p>新時代己排在我們的眼前，這是婦女發展能力的機會。阿國婦女已在援助男子抗敵。我國現在所處的環境，可算是萬分艱困的。希望一般中國婦女，亦能担任一份救國的責任。</p>
<h3>失望的人羣</h3>
<p>— 林豪</p>
<p>這裏是一條祇容兩個人並排着走的街道，街的外邊就是昌興米行的河埠頭，那裏橫七豎八地停泊着從鄉村裏出來的敞口船，船心裏裝滿了新米，重量太過了，把船身壓得很低，差不多大半個身子給埋到水裏去了，生根一般的，漾都不漾一下。船頭或是船尾，蹲着三五個船家，在談着天經地緯。</p>
<p>昌興米行就在這街的那邊。早晨的太陽光是淡弱的，透射到那裏，恰恰是照在幾個戴着破氈帽的，穿着襤褸衣衫的，面部曬得成了紫醬色的大漢這兒。他們是剛從河埠頭的船飛快的奔上來，述大氣也不曾透：「先生，市面怎麽樣？」</p>
<p>「糙米五塊半，榖三塊半。」帶了一副玳　眼鏡，像煞有介事，高傲的說，這位，據說就是這家昌興米行的賬房先生。</p>
<p>「什麽？「頭頂　像　　土一面　的</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>冷水，他們奇怪，剛才的火一般的熱烈底希冀呢？呀！生了翅膀飛去了麽？不信，似們祇覺得自家兒的眼珠子花起來了，停得那麽久：「記得今年六月裏賣過十一塊半的，你們……」</p>
<p>「六月是六月，現在是現在，說話別胡　。你倒不說那年買過十四塊的，不要說是十一塊半了。」</p>
<p>「哦！……」覺得沒有話可說：「但是，先生，那裏會跌得這樣快呢？」</p>
<p>「那倒够奇怪了。不想一想這是什麽年頭？人家吃飯也沒有餘錢，賣得貴誰擔負得起？再說各處的米都像潮水那樣的湧過來，照目下看來，哼哼！過幾天遝得跌下來呢！」</p>
<p>「那麽，……先生，請你老抬高些罷？」帶氈帽的懇着情說。</p>
<p>「嗤！」不好，先生泠笑了，後面還有話：「加錢？那麽我們就得當差了。喏大一家米行，那麼多的夥友，誰都要餓死了！」</p>
<p>「先生，可以救救我們種田人罷？抬高一些，我們多可憐！」</p>
<p>「先生，你行些好心罷！實在這價錢低得太可憐了，多少請加些？」</p>
<p>「和去年一樣，八元二吧！祇得請你們少賺一些兒了，先生……」</p>
<p>「你瞧，這班人多嚕囌，」賬房向另一位先生說着，一邊把手指兒點着這夥戴氈帽的，一會兒把頭回了過來：「你們誰都說價錢嫌不高，就不糶了吧！你有貨色我們有錢，兩不相犯的，多嚕囌算是什麼呢？那裏不是又靠來了兩支船了嗎？」向船埠頭指了一指，顯得十二分的神氣，把帶着玳瑁眼鏡的腦袋回了過去。</p>
<p>大家都像一只待宰的羔羊，私自他們轉到堦卜在議論了：</p>
<p>「我看還是搖到劉莊去　吧？」</p>
<p>「那不對，據說他們是同行公議的，恐怕不會上下吧？」</p>
<p>「哼…你信他們的鬼話？」</p>
<p>「同行公議還不用說，倒是搖到那裏又要多加上一筆船錢，回頭和昌興的一般，那就倒定了霉啦！劉莊不去吧！」</p>
<p>「不糶了，掉回去放到家去！」那個激憤地說重了。</p>
<p>「哼！不糶我們不見得就會死了。」先生回頭了：「外國大洋船裝來的是什麽？眞是……嗤……又是一聲冷笑。</p>
<p>熱烈的希冀，昌興米行，十一塊半，八塊二，五塊半，外國大洋船，……一切，都好像給予他們一陣戰慄。</p>
<p>剛才靠岸的却又來了，三五個紫皮膚，戴着破氈帽的傢伙。</p>
<p>「問問他們，什麽價錢？」</p>
<p>「糙米五塊半，穀三塊半。」先生照樣的說。</p>
<p>熟烈的希冀破滅了，又如肥皂泡，又爆裂了三五個。</p>
<p>先來的望望後來的，後來的看看先來的，大家的肚皮感到無限的空虛，和意智的悵惘。眼珠射到石堦下，沉默得像古井中的死水，永遠不會波動的模樣。</p>
<p>大家都是一副無可奈何的臉目。</p>
<p>於是，這個交易就在無可奈何中成就了。他們雖然不願把那些雪白的米顆送進昌興米行去，然而，他們更需要雪白的大銀元，在他們引爲遺憾的，就是將那樣大袋大袋的米掉取了少數的銀元，而且是一張張的花綠紙：</p>
<p>「先生，請你換給我們袁世凱的？」</p>
<p>「鈔票不一樣可以換東西，眞笨透！你這鄉下曲辮子！」</p>
<p>「那末，請你把中國銀行的給我們？」</p>
<p>「哼！挺硬挺破的中央銀行都不想，要　你準備想坐班　了吧？」先生光火了，拍一櫃台。怪神氣地說。帶氈帽的沒話說，垂着腦袋，沒神地踅回去了。</p>
<p>這樣，把他們未到這街道以前的熱望毀去了：妻子的花衣服，孩子的玩物，以及一切應用的東西，……現在，什麽都沒有了，得來的還不够付給地主，自己是白辛苦了一年，他們覺得世界在破滅了，他們感到無限的悒疼呵！</p>
<p>日頭走到頭頂心，照着這一羣失望的人們，漸漸地移到那邊河埠頭去了。</p>
<h3>夜店</h3>
<p>— 天</p>
<p>四五點錯落在叢山環抱的草屋里的燈火，和着明滅無常的流螢在傾瀉着，從東山的谷口深處瀉出了消澄如鏡的寞的夜月。</p>
<p>寂寞的夜月跚跚地步上蔥鬱的林梢，人在迢遙的客途中也忽忙了，一顆踉蹌的心並不曾縮短路的長度，而叢崗森森的恐怖，接著白晝的留難而出現了。把步子拉得史緊，幾千斤的重量却絆住了脚脛。</p>
<p>—宿店！宿店！是這麽渺茫地！</p>
<p>細石印針般地刺在脚心，厚原的浮皮也覺得劇痛，崎嶇的山路，便像崎嶇的人生是一抹曚朧的陰影，由寬斜而轉入夾徑，遠村的燈火也泯滅，只有流螢在燿燿地飛舞着，一輸新月眼也不瞥地燿在一片狹長的當空。</p>
<p>脚沒落地，心懸在每顆星斗的襟端顫抖着，遍身筋肉縮小它所佔的空間面積，把眼移到自已脚前的石子路，把心軐到他到了長安古城以後一切應酬的細節上他要抓工做，一定得應酬，走着，走着，然而把應酬和金錢聯結起來，他又小能不想到白書的損失上面來。</p>
<p>走着，走着，心身整個集中在白書的事上而：</p>
<p>偵探！抓起去！吃兩耳光！拘兩出時！罰十塊錢！祗賸下五塊了怎麽辦呢！</p>
<p>冷汗絲絲地浮上額際，是害怕，抑是惱怒？連他自己也不知道，跟着茸茸的半萎的棘芒，曲緩地走着，偶然仰頭，那座陰森的要關，閃在背後了，但那兇獰的不可這視的惡態，尙令他驚悸。</p>
<p>終於從兩峯夾抱的罅隙中跌在夜霧四鎖的一塊平原上了，燈火閃開螢火般的瞇眼，疏落地在角落處摜着，像小孩子見了陌生人那樣，他也像小孩子見了陌生人那樣東張西望，筋肉突然輕鬆起來，愉快地似乾癟了的游魚躍入了大海。</p>
<p>—沒有客店久便是墻壁根也得借宿一宵。</p>
<p>瞧着有燈亮的地方走去，從梯形田塍上發出的脚步聲震動到對山的深谷裏，音波立刻變成空洞的淸澈，聽覺敏感的犬吠應和着他脚聲的節拍，把只有三四斤便像有千萬斤的長包裏換到左肩，仙喘出整天來壓逼在胸中的一　悶氣。</p>
<p>「安寓客商」一塊長牌，在月光下依稀可以辨認的明白，一張竹架涼棚，遮去十月的寒霜，入了中年而又瘦弱的他，到這里才覺得暖和一些，一隻滿堂組火油燈燃著三隻紅火炬，他便在　剝花紋的那張板凳上坐下了。</p>
<p>夜店，怪孤姜的，除了一　上了五十左右的老夫婦外，再沒別人。爐火也熄滅了，老頭子睜着迷糊的眼，彷彿試探似的問：</p>
<p>「客人：歇一會是否還要趕路？」</p>
<p>「夜深了，我要宿在這里，有地方嗎？」</p>
<p>老頭子有點怕，又有點喜：「地方是有，可是……」</p>
<p>老頭子沒有下文，但他也沒有追究，看光景，老夫婦是可靠的，　的肚皮里咕　的響了，於是：</p>
<p>「請你燒點夜飯給我我吃，肚餓了。」</p>
<p>老婆子燒飯，老頭子打水　洗腳。他打開包裹里把鞋襪拿出來，把僅有二十來塊光洋縛在膘里。</p>
<p>吃過晚飯，老頭子領他到並列三間舖位一間屋子裏，並且囑咐他：</p>
<p>「你小心點！前三天夜裏這里被搶了，可憐連我們的破衣爛貨都給帶去了！」老頭子還有點余悸。</p>
<p>「是嗎？—前三天夜里？一</p>
<p>「是啊——你當心，這里有一個小門，假如前門有什麼嚮動，你便從這里逃。</p>
<p>老頭子去後，只留下一點火油燈，除他睡的一鋪床，其餘兩鋪連被子也沒有，灰塵珠網綴織了四壁，十壁上殘留些黑色斑紋。</p>
<p>他不敢睡，但又不能不睡，是啊，這兒山深林密，應該出强盜！如何呢？全身筋骨酸痛得再不能邁前寸步，把包裹枕着頭，兩手拊在腰中的錢袋上，焦灼着，彌留着，渾沌地睡着了……</p>
<p>是誰把住他的右膀，從床上扔到地上。</p>
<p>他茫然，何時打開大門，何時竄進他睡的房里，那對老夫婦究竟怎樣了，他全不知道。他左邊一半身子抖起一陣麻痛，才把眼睛睜開來。</p>
<p>「錢在那里？快拿出來！」那大漢的臉上施着薄薄的煤烟，但眞面目尙認得出來，便是白畫自稱稽查的人們，五六個全是，幾把馬刀晃晃地在地頭上飄。</p>
<p>「老爺，我沒錢，今天上半天我不是全給了你們嗎？</p>
<p>彭！一耳光是打在舊的痛處上，方式全一樣。</p>
<p>「你那里給我們？胡說！」將他拖一把，洋錢擲地可可響。「不抵駕！」</p>
<p>在他的拚命掙扎中，洋錢袋終給他們解去了，他呼嘯着，哭泣着：「店老板，救命啊，救命啊！」</p>
<h3>歸鳥</h3>
<p>— 小綺</p>
<p>像習慣於流浪的灰色鴿，游子的心啊，悵惘在溟漠的天體下跋涉在長途的旅程上，是感到異樣疲乏了。</p>
<p>我又鴿子樣從北方飛到南方，可是三年的日子，只給我帶回來一胸膛失望和蒼老的太息，而喪掉了靑春的錦繡的夢念，錦繡的憬憧是的，三年很匆促的呀，但我已經變成另一個人，彷彿頹敗的從前綫退回的落伍仕兵，蓬勃的英勇的熱情完全死滅，祇賸着一付破爛的身心，我重又投進生長我的故鄉，故鄉依舊有着茂密的果子樹，凈淙的河流，可愛的橙色的靑空，以及溫和的季候風，溫和的陽光，溫和的空氣。一切嫵媚的　景。然而我却沒有賞識的興緻，一顆心簡直是窩死水，閣沉沉的，打小起一點波瀾。我用着那顆死水的心，拖着迂緩的步子，迷惘地踏遍故鄉的地十在原野上，竹園的籬落間，墳墓的碑銘前，那一塊石牀，那一塊的草坪，我幾乎能够記住着，曾經坐在那上面，悠然地瀏覽遠郊山邊那兒落」日的色彩的幻　的姿態，一邊聽着牧牛童騎在畜生背頂，高聲唱起無韻的山歌，我差不多會沉醉不知日之將暮，現在我經過曾坐在那兒出神的每一塊石牀，每一堆草坪，我是毫無戚覺，僅僅知道自己遺失了一顆娛悅的心。而那簇簇的竹園同樣變成荒蕪的廢墟，望着廣闊的田區，都是白茫茫的水，只落得幾隻野雁在游來游去。</p>
<p>三年，是的，很匆促的呀，爲什麽一下子都變了。</p>
<p>自己的家，屋外的圍牆上，石榴樹三株巳死去了二株，活下的一株便那麼孤零似的，花蕊照舊的開，果實照萌的結，而親手裁種石榴樹的年老而溫靄的祖母已做了二年的墓中人。嗜吃石榴果子的父親，爲着一家的生計，去到遠遠的異方，還時時不忘在信里邊囑咐好好培養它，別讓枯萎，石榴是幸福的象徵啊！這話也爲祖母臨終的遺言。歿去了老祖母講故事的聲音，隔別了父親健談的嗓子，於是家園顯出十分的岑寂。而我的回來，却是伴着無邊的嘆息。</p>
<p>是的三年，很匆促的呀，可是不止自己變了，連家鄉的面目都變成那樣凄凉了。</p>
<p>想着家鄉終可讓我這因倦的歸烏安息一回事，而一切的情景却是這樣，我的呼吸越加急迫起來，只得鼓着無力的翅膀再飛出去吧！</p>

<h3>歌曲介紹</h3>
<p>村姑姑</p>
<p>村姑姑，樸素裝，三三五五，七山採茶忙。穀雨前，靑茶香，茶瓣嫩綠茶芽黃。香汗流，嘴乾荒，醒煩飢渴，何忍自先嘗。辛辛苦苦，積少成多，瓣瓣輸送到市塲。</p>
<p>村姑姑，結伴行，姊姊妹妹，入園採桑忙，蠶兒肥，蠶兒强，蠶身健康絲有光。織成緞，織成紡，寒冬熱夏，何自試新裝。勤勤儉儉，積尺成匹，件件輸送釗市塲。村姑姑，話衷腸，忙忙碌碌，勞辛了蠶桑。你聽那，布穀烏，聲聲吿知麥已黃。苦又苦，忙又忙，耕耘播種，又爲挿秧忙，戰戰競競，豈嫌辛勞，來日祝願是豐穰。村姑姑，話衷腸，匆匆忽忽，天氣已秋凉，你看那，都市里，多少美艷衣紅妝。公子哥，少年郎，茶芽解渴，玉體覆羅裳。安安逸逸，衣暖飯香，居處高樓多風光。</p>

<h3>Military and Political Minister He Yingqin Discusses; The Central Government's Policy Towards Japan Remains Unchanged; Anyone with a Calm Mind and Abundant Common Sense Will Not Be Fooled by Rumormongers</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Because of the various rumors that have occurred in Shanghai recently, which have had a considerable impact on people's hearts and security, the reporter specially visited Military and Political Minister He Yingqin. Minister He personally received the reporter and said in a very relaxed manner: "Shanghai is a place where various parties are mixed, and rumors are easy to arise. Moreover, due to the instigation of speculators, things are often fabricated out of thin air, and rumors are used as their tools, regardless of the interests of the country and society. The Central Government's diplomacy towards Japan is based on a spirit of goodwill in order to improve all relations between the two countries. This policy has never changed. The rumors in Shanghai are completely untrue. Anyone with a calm mind and abundant common sense will not be fooled by the rumormongers." (Central News Agency dispatch from the 15th)</p>

<h3>Okada Visits Saionji</h3>
<p>Shizuoka Prime Minister Okada visited Prince Saionji at Zuogyosō in Okitsu on his way back from the great exercise. They talked for more than an hour, reporting on the various problems that had occurred since the visit in early May, and revealing his beliefs and determination regarding the pressing problems at present. The main points are as follows: Although the budget for the next year was compiled according to the policy of Finance Minister Takahashi to gradually reduce public debt, in view of the current international situation, the budget that fully recognizes national defense first must be included. On the one hand, the budget related to rural areas cannot be ignored, so it was decided to allocate funds appropriately to compile it. Japan has decided to happily participate in the Disarmament Conference and appointed full powers. However, Japan will ultimately deal with the conference in accordance with its established policy, and the future does not seem optimistic. The government plans to hold the election smoothly after the next session of Parliament ends without incident, but depending on the attitude of the Seiyukai, dissolution is not ruled out.

<h3>Qin Dechun Receives the Press; Says That No Boxing Incident Occurred in North China; Will Strictly Suppress Unscrupulous Merchants Disrupting the Market</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Qin Dechun received the press this afternoon and released a written statement and answers to questions. (Special dispatch from the 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qin Dechun received the press at 4 p.m. on the 15th and said that Beiping is a world-renowned city and that in this difficult situation, it is only possible to cooperate with the people on the principle of good neighborliness and internal stability to seek the development of the city. He hoped that the press would understand the difficulties and speak carefully so as not to make the people feel uneasy. He then answered reporters' questions: (1) The overall direction of Sino-Japanese diplomacy is probably being negotiated between the central departments of both sides. As for local issues, no new incidents have occurred in North China recently. Matsui's visit to Beiping is for sightseeing and inspection. (2) Song Zheyuan is very concerned about the implementation of currency regulations. The government has now ordered the establishment of a Tianjin Preparatory Management Branch, and in addition to the personnel already sent by the government, it seems that more honest and powerful local gentry and merchants should participate together to show credibility. Although Beiping is handled by the Tianjin Branch, cash is stored locally to reassure the people, and the market can be stabilized. If unscrupulous merchants and rioters take the opportunity to profiteer and arbitrarily raise prices, they will be severely suppressed. (3) The municipal government's personnel all adopt the principle of talent. At present, the various bureaus and offices are still working as usual, and there are no changes. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 15th)</p>

(Central News Agency dispatch from the 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Since Liang Jishu, the new magistrate of Xianghe, arrived in the county and started anew, the 7th Company of Zhang Qingyu's 1st Brigade of the Security Team has entered the city to garrison. Order in the county is gradually recovering. However, due to the great constraints from all sides after the incident, the original situation cannot be restored for a while. Regarding post-war matters, the Hebei Provincial Government has formulated a plan and ordered Magistrate Liang to discuss and maintain measures with fair local gentry. The Bao Wei Tuan [local militia], which has always been under the command of Wu Yiting, is still secretly controlled by Wu and others. Although the county government has been handed over by the rebel people, the actual implementation of local government affairs is still greatly constrained. Tiancun and the Japanese military police who went to Xianghe to assist in the takeover of the county government have recently left Xianghe and returned to Beiping. (Special dispatch from the 15th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Xianghe incident has been completely resolved. Wu Zhenyi and An Houzhai, the leaders of the rioters, sneaked into Tianjin with a certain foreign ronin on the night of the 14th and hid in a certain foreign concession. The order in Xianghe County has been completely restored. The new magistrate, Liang Jishu, has taken over, and all the section chiefs and others appointed by the pseudo-magistrate have fled. Chen Qingyun, a counselor sent by the Provincial Government, went to Baoding on the 14th to investigate and assist Magistrate Liang in handling post-war matters. (Special dispatch from the 15th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Baoding telephone: Li Yintang, the magistrate of Qingyun County, telegraphed the province that on the 10th, two foreign ronin and the treacherous people Chen Xiufu arrived in the county from Tianjin. Under the guise of investigation, they planned to travel all over the countryside to mobilize. The magistrate took early precautions and ordered the police to monitor Chen and detained the two ronin. On the 13th, the Provincial Government ordered Ge Yuquan's battalion of the 32nd Army stationed nearby to send two companies of troops to suppress them and escort the two ronin to Tianjin and send them to the Japanese Consulate General. The local area has now been pacified. (Special dispatch from the 15th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The Tianjin Municipal Public Security Bureau recently investigated cases of smuggling copper coins and violating legal prices, confiscating more than 230,000 copper coins and fining 238 silver dollars. All of them will be distributed to soup kitchens to subsidize disaster relief. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The outward transport of copper coins from Tianjin is increasing daily. Although the legal price stipulates 500 copper coins per one national currency yuan, there is a severe shortage of spot goods. The Construction Office of the Nine Districts of the city has jointly submitted a request to the municipal government to negotiate with various banks to quickly issue copper coin notes for relief. The Tianjin Chamber of Commerce and the Money Industry Association have also sent another letter to the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, urging them to speed up the issuance of copper coin notes to facilitate turnover. Rice and flour prices in Qinhuangdao have risen again, with one legal tender yuan exchanging for only 440 copper coins.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin Dispels Rumors</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Since the incident of the murder of Japanese Navy Marine Corps soldier Nakayama Hideo, rumors have been rife in Shanghai and its surrounding areas. Residents of the 128th War Zone and the Hongkou area have been moving their furniture and luggage to the South Bund Concession one after another. Rental cars have been fully booked. In the past two days, some people were still moving late at night. This floating phenomenon not only causes economic losses to the citizens themselves, but also causes the revival of northern Shanghai to come to a standstill. Even in terms of foreign relations, it is feared that some repercussions will inevitably occur.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that this unconscious state of avoidance is the result of the citizens' belief in unfounded rumors. However, there are two root causes. One is that the nightmare of the Songhu war has not yet been eliminated from the minds of the citizens. The current incident of the murder of a Japanese sailor easily makes the citizens revert to their past state of fear. The second is that recently, just after the promulgation of the new currency policy, important figures from all sides united in sincerity and gathered in the capital to hold the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang. These two events are major events for the party and the country. Those who are fond of creating disturbances and speculators inevitably take the opportunity to make all kinds of unfounded speculations, which are spread around. And the general public, who have little knowledge, turn fantasy into reality.</p>
<p>Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin issued a statement yesterday dispelling rumors, saying that the central government's diplomacy with Japan is based on a spirit of friendship in order to seek improvement between the two countries. This policy has never changed. The rumors in Shanghai are completely untrue, etc. At the same time, in addition to ordering the Public Security Bureau to prohibit residents from moving without reason, the Shanghai Municipal Government also issued a statement. It is hoped that citizens will use common sense to judge rumors and observe the situation calmly. At a time when people's hearts are wavering, the sincere expression of the responsible authorities is truly essential. The gloomy atmosphere that has pervaded Shanghai for the past few days should be swept away from now on.</p>
<h3>U.S. President Roosevelt's Proclamation Inaugurates Philippine Autonomy, First President Takes Office, Parliament Opens, 19-Gun Salute, Hundreds of Thousands of Spectators</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt's proclamation on the establishment of the Philippine Autonomous Government has been issued today and will be formally promulgated at the ceremony to be held in Manila tomorrow. The President has also telegraphed the new Philippine President Quezon, asking him to convey his congratulations to the Philippine people. The proclamation was signed by the President himself, with Secretary of State Hull and Army Chief of Staff Craig present at the time. (National Telegram on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Washington) After the President issued the proclamation, he stated, "After the publication of this document, the existing government of the Philippines will cease its functions, and the Philippine Autonomous Government will accept all the powers and responsibilities stipulated in its constitution." The President also sent a telegram to Philippine Governor Murphy, expressing his gratitude for Murphy's loyal service and wishing him success in his new position as the first U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, which he will assume tomorrow. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Manila) Manila was overjoyed today. About 150,000 to 200,000 people gathered in front of the Legislative Yuan to watch the ceremony. The weather was fine, and airplanes soared in the sky above the Legislative Yuan. The ceremony for the establishment of the new government was as follows: First, the Archbishop blessed the new republic. Then, Philippine Governor Murphy introduced Secretary of War Dern, President Roosevelt's representative, to the public. Dern officially read the U.S. President's congratulatory message to the new President Quezon and the Filipino people. Then, he delivered a speech, comparing the Philippines' request for freedom from the United States with the United States' previous request for freedom from Great Britain. Afterwards, Philippine Governor Murphy officially read the U.S. President's proclamation. The President and Vice President then took office under the supervision of the Chief Justice of the Philippine Supreme Court. A 19-gun salute was fired, and the bells rang nine times. Dern announced that the Republic of the Philippine Islands had been established. Afterwards, President Quezon delivered his inaugural address. After a short break, President Quezon reviewed the troops. Shortly after, President Quezon entered Malacañang Palace. The parliament, with this as the president, was scheduled to open this afternoon, at which time officials will be sworn in. A grand banquet will be held at night to celebrate. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Manila) The United States promised independence to the Philippine Islands when it first ruled them in 1898. Today, the establishment of the autonomous government is a further step towards this goal. The autonomous government is scheduled for ten years, until July 4, 1946, and then it will be fully independent. This order has been formally promulgated by President Roosevelt and was read out at the ceremony for the establishment of the autonomous government in front of the Philippine Legislative Yuan this morning at 9:00 a.m. Representatives from all sides participated in the grand ceremony, and the Philippine people also gathered in the park at the intersection of Bellgas Road. Initially, President Quezon and Vice President Osmeña were sworn in, indicating the transfer of power. After the swearing-in, a 19-gun salute was fired to celebrate the President's inauguration. Although the Philippines is still under U.S. suzerainty, the salute for the U.S. President's inauguration is also 19 guns, so its honor is in fact no different. Afterwards, Secretary of War Dern, President Roosevelt's personal representative, congratulated the Philippine people and stated that the United States still has a keen interest in the prosperity of the Philippines. Quezon's inaugural speech expressed his loyalty and dedication. At that time, there were about 250,000 people in front of the building, and the Philippine cabinet and Supreme Court justices, etc., were seated in order on the stage, with former Governor Murphy as chairman. After Quezon's speech, high-ranking officials on the stage held the opening ceremony of the parliament at 4:00 p.m. However, the formal meeting will be held at 10:00 a.m. on November 22. There will also be a celebratory dance party in the evening, and there will be important ceremonies every day until the U.S. guests return home on November 20. (National Telegram on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Manila) After President Quezon entered the Presidential Palace, he signed two executive orders and one proclamation. A grand banquet was held at night to entertain guests. Today, all places were very peaceful and there were no disturbances. Because people were coming and going like weaving in Manila, traffic was completely stopped, but everything gradually returned to normal by the evening. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<h3>Quezon, the First President of the Philippines</h3>
<p>— Bu Ren</p>
<p>On September 10th of this year, the Philippines held its first election for the autonomous government based on the Independence Act. As a result, the leaders of the United Party, Quezon and Osmeña, were elected as President and Vice President respectively. The competitors, old revolutionary General Aguinaldo and Archbishop Aglipay, were defeated. Mr. Quezon took office as the first President with a six-year term yesterday.</p>
<p>Among the heads of state of various countries, Quezon's origins can be said to be the humblest. He is 57 years old this year and was born in the countryside far from Manila. His father was a poor farmer. He received a few years of education in Manila as a child, and later joined the army. During the Philippine Revolution in 1898, Quezon, who was 20 years old, was a junior officer in the revolutionary army commanded by General Aguinaldo.</p>
<p>In 1900, his classmate Osmeña founded the "Daily News" daily newspaper in Cebu, advocating independence. Quezon was a strong supporter. In 1906, Osmeña organized the "Radical Independence Party," and Quezon joined as a youth leader in the party. The following year, the "Radical Independence Party" merged with the "United Nationalist Party" and reorganized into the "Philippine Nationalist Party." Osmeña was crowned as the party leader, and Quezon was only a second-class leader.</p>
<p>Quezon's opportunity to show his talents began in 1912. From that time on, he was sent to the United States as a special commissioner by the Philippine Parliament to socialize with people in the American political arena and enthusiastically made the following propaganda:</p>
<p>"The people of the Philippines will never be happy to be ruled by the United States or any other country. Since being ruled by Spain, the politics of this country has at least been interfered with by others. As such, the people of the Philippines will never be satisfied. Why? Because they have not yet obtained the rights they deserve. Therefore, unless they manage their own affairs completely by themselves, the Filipinos will never get true satisfaction and gratitude."</p>
<p>Quezon's eloquent rhetoric and sincere appearance finally won the favor of President Wilson and the Progressive Party and Democratic Party under his rule. As a result, the Philippine Autonomy Ordinance, known as the "Jones Act," was passed in the U.S. Senate in 1916. From then on, the Philippine independence movement obtained a legal basis, and Quezon's personal political status in the country also soared. In 1917, the Philippine Parliament was changed to a bicameral system. Quezon was elected as the Speaker of the Senate and continued to serve until this year. Osmeña was the Speaker of the House of Representatives. From then on, the Nationalist Party was secretly divided into two factions, one led by Quezon, which later became the "National Democratic Party," and the other led by Osmeña, which later became the "Independent Democratic Party." The two factions fought openly and secretly, each refusing to give in.</p>
<p>In 1933, Osmeña led an independence request group to the United States and won the concrete independence plan called the "Cutting Act." After returning to the Philippines, he hoped to overwhelm Quezon, but was opposed by the Quezon faction. The Quezon faction was deeply dissatisfied because the bill was attached with a clause reserving military bases, and launched an opposition movement, chanting slogans such as "Immediate Independence" and "Complete Independence." The "Cutting Act" was then rejected by the Philippine Parliament.</p>
<p>Quezon, who opposed the Cutting Act, formed another independence request group to realize his claim, and personally led it to the United States to lobby Roosevelt and other political figures to amend it. As a result of his efforts, he finally achieved his wish, and Roosevelt approved the Tydings Amendment. On May 1 of this year, this amendment was passed by the Philippine Parliament. At this point, the Philippine independence movement came to an end.</p>
<p>In fact, the "Tydings Amendment" is not much different from the original "Cutting Act." However, by making such a new trick, Quezon won the support of party members and the public. Quezon's election as President was probably a foregone conclusion. Unfortunately, Osmeña originally did not even have a share in the vice-presidency. Because the highly respected old revolutionary General Aguinaldo came out to run for President, Quezon felt quite afraid, so he had to win over Osmeña to compete. As a result, the two parties repaired their old relationship and formed the United Party, and the leaders of the two parties won the election victory.</p>
<p>The day after the election results were announced, Quezon declared to the public:</p>
<p>"The election results show that the people believe in the platform and personnel of the United Party. In this moment of victory, I am only thinking about the important work that lies before me. I ask God to help me cope with the serious responsibilities that have been placed on my shoulders. I am deeply grateful to the people who respect me so much."</p>
<p>Here, we see a mixture of complacency and humility in Quezon. However, Quezon should not be complacent, nor should he be humble. Whether the Philippines can truly become independent and whether Quezon can become a true leader, the answers to these questions have only just begun yesterday.</p>

<h3>British General Election, Government Party's Victory Confirmed, But Labor Party Receives More Votes Than Last Time, MacDonald and Samuel Both Lose</h3>
<p>(London) Although the election results have not yet been fully announced, the opposition party has admitted today that the government party has won. As of 3:00 p.m. today, the election results are as follows: the government party has won 340 seats, the opposition party has won 130 seats, and the independent party has won one seat. Former Prime Minister and current Privy Councilor MacDonald has actually lost the election. The government's victory is certain. The bond market and the commodity exchange market are slightly firmer. (National Telegram on the 15th)</p>
<p>(London) Liberal opposition leader Samuel was defeated by Conservative candidate Russell in Darwin, Lancashire, by a majority of 1,157. This is the first surprising event in the general election. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(London) In this general election, although the Labor Party received more votes than in the 1931 general election, the government did not encounter a "rout" everywhere. Political observers speculate based on this morning's report that the government will definitely win a solid victory. Although the Labor Party won in many industrial areas, the government party was still able to maintain its position in many large towns. All twelve seats in Birmingham were still won by Conservative candidates. Liverpool still has eight Conservative seats and three Labor seats. Scottish Secretary of State Collin and Health Minister Wood, who initially feared failure, have been re-elected. Railway workers' leader Thomas won by a large majority in Derby. As of 3:00 a.m. this morning, the government party had won a total of 184 seats, and the opposition party had won a total of 85 seats. Foreign Secretary Hoare, Finance Minister Neville Chamberlain, and his brother Austen Chamberlain have all been re-elected. Morrison, chairman of the London County Council, who previously served as the Minister of Transport in the Labor government and is a powerful figure in the Labor Party, failed in the last election, but this time he defeated Conservative female candidate Mrs. Graves. Another important Labor leader, Clynes, who previously served as the Lord Privy Seal and Home Secretary in the Labor government and was also the chairman of the Labor Party in Parliament, also failed in the last election, but has been re-elected this time and can return to the House of Commons. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<h3>Recent Developments in the Election</h3>
<p>(London) The results of the general election are now known for about 400 seats. The government party has a majority of 169 seats over the opposition party. The reports from London and major cities on the first day made the Labor Party's hopes of winning dwindle. Today's results not only decided the Labor Party's failure, but also made the majority of the government party larger than expected. The most noteworthy event in the election is that Privy Councilor MacDonald, his son (Colonial Secretary), and Liberal Party leader Samuel all suffered defeat.</p>
<p>Only 390 candidates have been elected so far, all of whom belong to the Conservative Party.</p>
<p>As of 1:40 p.m. today, the situation of each party is as follows: the government party has won a total of 279 seats, and the opposition party has won a total of 110 seats. At that time, the government party had won 7 seats and lost 55 seats, and the opposition party had won 59 seats and lost 11 seats. Independent Liberal Party leader Lloyd George, Home Secretary Simon, and Cabinet Minister Eden have all been elected.</p>
<p>Privy Councilor MacDonald returned to London from the Seaham constituency without waiting for the election results to be announced and told a Reuters reporter that he had failed. This election was extremely competitive and very dirty. He was very tired and did not want to discuss his personal future plans.</p>
<p>The Conservative Party headquarters was very pleased with the results. Labor leader Morrison said that he was very disappointed with the Labor Party's overall report and that he had hoped that they would have done better. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>MacDonald's Sorrowful State</p>
<p>(London) National Labor Party leader and Privy Councilor MacDonald, who previously campaigned in the Seaham constituency, was greatly ridiculed by local miners. After the election ended last night, he returned here and told people, "I knew I would be defeated in the Seaham constituency, but I fought a fierce national battle and did my best."

<h3>Egyptian Anti-British Movement; Britain Will Not Interfere; Premier Nessim Announces Cooperation with Britain</h3>
<p>(London) Responsible sources announced today that Britain intends to avoid political or military interference in the anti-British demonstrations in Egypt. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>Cairo celebrated the anniversary of the Nessim Cabinet's inauguration today. The government issued a lengthy proclamation defending its policies, stating that the Egyptian economic panic, lasting five years, has had a profound impact on the national economy, and the current cabinet is working to provide relief. Regarding the relationship between Britain and Egypt, due to the current special circumstances, Egypt must cooperate with Britain on a basis of complete freedom. (Havas Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Cairo Premier Nessim recently issued a statement explaining the negotiations between Britain and Egypt on the Egyptian constitution issue. It is said that King Fuad advocated restoring the 1923 Constitution. The British government suggested that a new constitution should be drafted to better meet the needs of the Egyptian people. The negotiations had not yet reached a compromise when the Italo-Ethiopian dispute arose. Premier Nessim then began negotiations with the British government, requesting British protection for Egypt to maintain its independence. Britain then concentrated a portion of its Mediterranean fleet in Alexandria, while also providing assurances to Egypt that it had no intention of changing the status quo of Egypt and did not wish to use Alexandria as a permanent naval base.

<h3>Western Travel Notes</h3>
<p>— Ji Yuan</p>
<p>A Visit to Beibei (Part 1)</p>
<p>On the morning of October 6th, the reporter and Mr. Songhua braved the rain to visit Beibei. We had heard of the new construction projects in Beibei while in Shanghai, and upon arriving in Chongqing, friends also told us that Beibei was a must-see. Therefore, immediately after arriving in Chongqing, we went to visit Beibei. On that day, we got up at 4 a.m., quickly got washed and packed, and took the rickshaw that had been reserved the night before to the Qianximen Wharf. As dawn broke, we boarded the Minsheng steamer just after 5 a.m. The autumn rain was drizzling all the way, which was quite inconvenient. Chongqing is very rainy, which is a real pain. The passengers on the ship were crowded, and the voices were noisy. The fare to Beibei was a uniform one dollar, regardless of class, which fits the principle of popularization. However, there were few seats and many passengers, so those who arrived later often had to stand. We were fortunate to be invited by Mr. Zheng Bicheng, the manager of Minsheng Company, to sit in the manager's office, avoiding the crowds. I was secretly very grateful. At 6:30 a.m., the ship sailed up the Jialing River. Peering out the window, we saw picturesque scenery on both banks. The journey from Chongqing to the Wenquan Park in Beibei is only about 140 li, and it passes through two gorges of the Jialing River (Guanyin Gorge and Wenquan Gorge). In addition, there is Niubi Gorge. The scenery of these three gorges, although not as majestic and perilous as the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River, is more beautiful. Now, I will briefly describe the situation in Beibei based on what I saw and heard.</p>
<p>1. Wenquan (Hot Springs) Park. At noon, the ship arrived at Wenquan Park. After disembarking, we climbed up the steps. At that time, the park was busy preparing for a group wedding. The members of the Youth Volunteer Corps were also engaged in preparing the auditorium and the venue, which are part of an ancient temple. The Buddha statue still exists today. Since Lu Zuofu became the head of the Gorge Defense Bureau in 1927, he has been determined to develop it, and it has now become a public tourist area. The park has a lot of flowers and trees, and the scenery is quiet and elegant. Walking through it, one feels as if they are in a cool world. The park is equipped with hotels, restaurants, bathhouses, swimming pools, tennis courts, basketball courts, libraries, music rooms, etc. I heard that many mass gatherings in Chongqing and Beibei are held here. Under the guidance of Manager Zheng and Manager Ma of Minsheng Company, we visited various caves. The next morning, we braved the rain to visit Jinyun Temple, but due to lack of time, we had to turn back halfway, which was regrettable. In the afternoon, we watched the group wedding ceremony in the park's auditorium. This group wedding was initiated voluntarily by the people and was very economical, which corrected the old custom of elaborate rituals and wasteful spending.</p>
<p>2. Youth Volunteer Corps. In Wenquan Park, we saw the lives and work of the Youth Volunteer Corps. The training of the Youth Volunteer Corps is an expression of Lu Zuofu's advocacy of "human training." Mr. Lu believes that the fundamental problem in China is "human training." Therefore, he pays special attention to the training of young people in all kinds of construction. The central meaning of his training of young people is to "make the generally trained young people full of social demands, social ideals, and social activities, requiring them to understand very clearly the current trends of the world and the difficulties of China, and to understand very clearly the ideal Three Gorges and demand to realize it." This is an important point in his rural construction theory and a characteristic of Beibei's construction of China.</p>
<p>The daily life of the Youth Volunteer Corps is very arduous and disciplined. They wear straw sandals and yellow cloth uniforms (woven by the Three Gorges Cloth Factory). They are strong, have shaved heads. The members are all young students with middle school or higher education. I heard that there are many applicants each time they recruit, and due to the limited number of places, the admission is very strict. Special attention is paid to physical examinations. Those who are slightly physically weak are not admitted. The training period is one year, divided into three stages. The first stage is (A) military subjects, (B) scout training, (C) service training, including document management, bookkeeping, statistics, etc. The second stage is (A) police service training, (B) social investigation training, (C) social education training. The third stage is traveling to border areas, investigating the lives of aborigines, and collecting natural specimens. Daily life in the team begins at 5 a.m. After washing, they gather in the sports field to exercise according to the arranged exercise program for one hour. After breakfast, they start work. They are responsible for sweeping the floor, dumping manure, wiping the floor, wiping tables and chairs, glass windows, as well as planting, irrigating, removing insects, and washing clothes, in order to cultivate the spirit of hard work, endurance, courage, and enterprise in group life. The reporters visited the dormitory of the Youth Volunteer Corps and saw that the quilts were neatly folded and printed with the four characters "Sleeping on brushwood and tasting gall," a spirit of perseverance and determination overflowing from their daily lives. I heard that the establishment of the Youth Volunteer Corps began in the autumn of 1928. In the spring of 1933, a special student team was added, graduating in six months. The training program is roughly the same as that of the Youth Volunteer Corps. A total of 95 people have graduated and have been assigned to serve in various business organizations in the Gorge area. Two teams of the Youth Volunteer Corps have graduated, and there are currently about 60 members of the Youth Volunteer Corps in school.</p>
<p>3. Visit to the Gorge Defense Bureau. After visiting Wenquan Park, we hired a small boat at about 4 p.m. on the 7th to go to Beibei. From Wenquan to Beibei is only 10 li away, and the boat travels downstream in about 20 minutes to the borrowed Gorge Defense Bureau. The Gorge Defense Bureau is the abbreviation of the Jiangba Bi-Tai Special Group Gorge Defense Bureau. It was established around 1918-1919, initially named the Gorge Defense Camp. Its mission was to suppress bandits in the Three Gorges of the Jialing River. In 1923, it was renamed the current name (recently, it was heard that it will be renamed the Jiangba Bi-He Experiment Zone). In the spring of 1927, Lu Zuofu and Xiong Mingfu became the director and deputy director, respectively. In addition to suppressing bandits, they began to build cultural and economic projects. The organization of the Gorge Defense Bureau is a director and deputy director, each with one person. Underneath are the Training Department and three sections: General Affairs, Politics, and Audit. The Training Department commands the Youth Volunteer Corps, Special Task Force One, Special Task Force Two, Special Task Force Three, and the Pistol Team. In addition, there are group affairs instructors, hiring local prestigious figures to serve as group affairs instructors. Currently, the First Special Task Force is stationed in Beibei City, with about 60 team members. Their work includes: (1) Police aspects (A) investigating households, (B) registering births, deaths, marriages, and migrations, (C) handling people's disputes, (D) organizing fire brigades; (2) public education aspects (A) training people to observe order (training citizens to observe order at public gatherings, training passengers to observe order at riverside wharves), (B) training people to pay attention to hygiene (inspecting the cleanliness of the market, rewarding the extermination of flies and rats, publicizing hygiene matters, etc.), (C) training people for public activities (teaching people to sing at public gatherings, teaching people to clap at public gatherings); (3) local operations (A) organizing riverside wharves, (B) assisting in the construction of public roads, (C) delineating various markets, (D) constructing public toilets. The Second Special Task Force is stationed along the Beichuan Railway, with about 130 people, with three sub-stations stationed along the railway. Their regular work, in addition to the above points, is to escort trains, passengers, and cargo, and maintain order at the station. In terms of education, they pay attention to inspecting household cleanliness and establishing literacy night schools (there is currently one), public picture newspaper reading rooms (there is one), and news briefings (there are currently four). The Third Special Task Force is stationed in Xiaxikou, with about 130 people. The police work focuses on protecting the security of the mining area. Local management businesses include public sports grounds, public libraries, public clock towers, and the operation of the Canal Park, etc. The main task of the Pistol Team is to maintain local security, with about a hundred people. Their work can be divided into four aspects: (1) Security, (2) Military Training, (3) Social Work, (4) Morning Management. In terms of security (A) dispatching teams to patrol various fields in the Gorge area at any time, (B) secretly observing bandits in various fields in the Gorge area and the Heyu (Hechuan-Chongqing) area at any time. In terms of military training, they practice national martial arts for one hour every morning. Academic subjects are taught for two sessions each in the morning and afternoon. Field exercises and shooting exercises are conducted once a week each. In terms of social work, every year in winter (lecturing to the national people on November 8th and 10th for two days)</p>

<h3>The Benefits of the National Calendar</h3>
<p>— Chen ZunKui, Researcher at the Astronomical Institute of the Academia Sinica</p>
<p>(A lecture given to the national public on November 8th and 10th)</p>
<p>The topic we are going to discuss is "The Benefits of the National Calendar." Before we delve into this topic, we must first understand what a "calendar" is and what the "National Calendar" is. Only then can we understand its benefits. Furthermore, the goodness or badness of a thing is inherently subjective. Someone might say it's good, while another might say it's bad. Therefore, to determine whether something is good or bad, we must compare it with something else. To discuss the benefits of the National Calendar, we need to compare it with another calendar system. The calendar system we will use for comparison is the old calendar that we have abolished. Thus, before we delve into this topic, we must first know how the old calendar was made. Therefore, I can divide this topic into three sections: first, what is a calendar? Second, how are the National Calendar and the old calendar made? Third, what are the benefits of the National Calendar?</p>
<p>First, let's ask what the significance of a calendar is. What exactly is a calendar? In simple terms, a calendar can be described as an almanac or calendar book. More precisely, a calendar is a calendrical system. The calendar itself has no inherent meaning; it arises from the needs of society and evolves with human progress. As you all know, the sun has two most obvious movements relative to our position. The first is its movement from east to west, and the second is its movement from north to south. The causes of these two movements have been explained before: the first is due to the Earth's rotation, and the second is due to the Earth's revolution, which is the Earth's orbit around the sun. The first effect is that sunrise marks the day, and sunset marks the night. This is probably the earliest knowledge known to mankind. In the ancient hunter-gatherer era, when people were hungry, they would look for food, and when they were thirsty, they would look for water. When the sun came out, they would hunt, and when it went down, they would rest. Humans' concept of time only consisted of day and night, knowing only the "day." But the second effect, the north-south movement, created the changing of the four seasons. It dictated the laws of hibernation and awakening, growth, maturity, germination, and withering of plants and animals. This knowledge may have taken humans thousands or even tens of thousands of years to discover. The sun's north-south cycle, which we now call a year, has an inescapable causal relationship with the climate. Gaining this true knowledge can be said to be the first great contribution of astronomy to mankind. Since human life is governed by these two cycles—day and year—for the sake of safety and improvement, humans cannot help but follow the movements of the heavens to define units of time and make them the standard for their lives. Especially for nations that have evolved to the agricultural era, the knowledge and utilization of the year have become an indispensable matter for survival. This is why the two cycles of day and year have become natural units of time in the calendar.</p>
<p>However, the number of days in each year is more than three hundred and sixty. Counting from the beginning to the end of the year, in the eyes of the ancients, was probably very troublesome and difficult to remember clearly. Furthermore, human life became more and more complex, and this method of recording gradually became inconvenient. Therefore, an intermediate cycle was inserted. There were two ways to create this intermediate cycle. The first was to take a set of regular intervals and count them down cyclically. For example, the Chinese Jiazi system of recording days, which uses sixty days as a cycle, rotating continuously, and the foreign weekly system, which uses seven days as a cycle, rotating continuously, are both examples of this method and are both very ancient. The second was to use a visible celestial phenomenon to divide the year, and the waxing and waning of the moon was the most suitable condition. This is why the origins of calendars in various countries around the world mostly contain lunar elements.</p>
<p>Therefore, the calendar arises from the needs of human life and evolution. It is the rule for specifying the allocation of years, months, and dates. It must conform to celestial phenomena and strive for the convenience of society. In the past, calendrical systems focused on the precision of calculations. Now, the cycles of the sun, moon, and earth are already well understood. Therefore, today's calendrical systems are not concerned with the density of calculations, but rather with the harmony of the annual, monthly, and daily allocations.</p>
<p>We already know that the elements of a calendar are the year, the month, and the day. The standard for these three elements is that the year is based on the time it takes for the Earth to revolve around the Sun once, the month is based on the time it takes for the Moon to revolve around the Earth once, and the day is based on the time it takes for the Earth to rotate on its axis once. We know that the number of days it takes for the Earth to orbit the Sun is not a whole number; it is three hundred and sixty-five and a quarter of a day, minus a little bit. However, the practical year must contain a whole number of days, which is already enough to cause us trouble when creating a calendar. Now, we must also insert a monthly division, and the length of the month is based on the time it takes for the Moon to orbit the Earth, which is also twenty-nine and a fraction of a day, not a whole number of days. Since a month does not contain a whole number of days, and a year is not a whole number of months, reconciling them becomes a complex problem. It can be said that the purpose of ancient Chinese astronomy was to solve this problem.</p>
<p>The calendar used in China can be roughly divided into four periods. The first is the calendar used before the first year of the Taichu era of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty (before 104 BC). The details are no longer known. The second is the calendar from the Taichu era of the Han Dynasty to the early Qing Dynasty (around 1600 AD). There are written records of the calendar reforms in historical records. Although there were more than seventy calendar reformers, the principles remained unchanged, and they were all calendars created by China itself. The third is the calendar of the Qing Dynasty, which used Western methods and combined them with the old calendar system, which is the period of Sino-Western integration. The fourth is the Roman Gregorian calendar established by Gregory XIII, which was adopted after the establishment of the Republic of China and is now called the National Calendar. (Note 1) In my personal opinion, the current calendar was not created by China itself. It is not appropriate to call a calendar created by others the National Calendar. However, the Central Party Headquarters has designated it as the National Calendar, so I will still refer to it as the National Calendar.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the principles of the calendar used from the Taichu era of the Han Dynasty to the early Qing Dynasty remained unchanged. Their principle was that each year contained twelve lunar months, and the lunar month was determined by the new moon and full moon. Each month had twenty-nine or thirty days, so twelve months were several days shorter than a solar year of three hundred and sixty-five days. After several years, when the difference amounted to a month, a lunar month was added to that year, called a leap month. That year then had thirteen months. Roughly speaking, there were seven leap months in nineteen years. Their efforts were to obtain accurate lunar and solar cycles and the most appropriate way to insert leap months.</p>
<p>In addition to the lunar month divisions, our old calendar also had twenty-four solar terms. It should be said that there were twelve "zhongqi" (principal solar terms) and twelve "jieqi" (secondary solar terms), but in ordinary speech, they are often mixed up and called solar terms. When discussing the changes of the four seasons last time, I mentioned that the twenty-four solar terms are determined according to the sun's annual position. Their allocation is based on Lichun (Beginning of Spring) as the first month's "jie," Yushui (Rain Water) as the first month's "zhong," Jingzhe (Awakening of Insects) as the second month's "jie," Chunfen (Vernal Equinox) as the second month's "zhong," and so on, dividing them into the third month's "jie," the third month's "zhong," and so on, in the order of Qingming (Clear and Bright), Guyu (Grain Rain), etc. Finally, Xiaohan (Minor Cold) is the twelfth month's "jie," and Dahan (Major Cold) is the twelfth month's "zhong." This is a very scientific method. Frankly speaking, it is more rational than the months of the solar calendar. However, the solar terms are only calculated by calendrical experts or measured by the length of the sun's shadow. They are not as obvious as the waxing and waning of the moon, so they probably came about much later than the lunar month system. This method of accommodating and reconciling the lunar month and the solar year is the so-called "lunar calendar" that China used for thousands of years before the revolution. It should really be called the "lunisolar calendar." This lunisolar calendar has many inconveniences.</p>
<p>First, the number of days in each year is not fixed and can differ by up to a month.</p>
<p>Second, the length of each month is not fixed.</p>
<p>Third, the same month and day of each year do not correspond to the same solar term, and the difference can also be up to a month.</p>
<p>Moreover, these uncertainties do not have simple rules that can be calculated. Therefore, to know the dates and solar terms of the old calendar, one must check the almanac issued each year. Because the positions of the sun and moon relative to the solar terms are not fixed, farmers not only have to check which month is large and which month is small, but also which day is the Vernal Equinox, which day is Clear and Bright, and so on. As for annual and monthly statistics, if accuracy is desired, it is, at the very least, extremely troublesome under this system. Therefore, after the success of the Xinhai Revolution, the Nanjing Provisional Government promulgated the adoption of the solar calendar. On the one hand, this was to eliminate the trouble of the lunar calendar, and on the other hand, it was to align with the world, because most countries in the world now use the solar calendar, and the globalization of various systems is of great significance with increasing global interaction.</p>
<p>The composition of the old calendar has already been mentioned above. How is the current National Calendar composed? Simply put, it abandons the lunar method, meaning it does not base a month on the time it takes for the moon to orbit the earth once. It only seeks the regularity of years and days, rigidly dividing the year into twelve months. Therefore, the names of its months are merely practically assumed terms that have no real scientific meaning. They are only used to coordinate the method of recording time. The unit of a year is considered too long, and the unit of a day is considered too short, so the unit of a month is used to reconcile them. To elaborate further, it is:</p>
<p>(1) A year is divided into three hundred and sixty-five days, and a leap year is three hundred and sixty-six days.</p>
<p>(2) A year is divided into twelve months.</p>
<p>(3) January, March, May, July, August, October, and December each have thirty-one days.</p>
<p>(4) April, June, September, and November each have thirty days.</p>
<p>(5) February has twenty-eight days in a common year and twenty-nine days in a leap year.</p>
<p>(6) A leap year occurs every four years, omitting one leap year every hundred years, and still leaping every four hundred years. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Helping to Dredge Dangerous Waters and Eliminate River Obstructions in the Hechuan-Yongchuan Area. Every summer, when the Jialing River rises, they help residents along the river move their houses. Every spring and autumn, they help the people build roads. In their spare time, all the soldiers in the team plant various flowers and fruit trees. It is said that last year, the Beibei Farm earned over a thousand yuan from watermelon production. The planting method uses scientific methods, and the watermelons are sweet and large, and they are popular. The reporter stayed at the Gorge Defense Bureau for three nights and talked a lot with the gentlemen of the bureau. The reporter's life gradually blended in with theirs. They use communal chopsticks when dining and eat standing up. At first, the reporter was very unaccustomed to it, but then he found it quite meaningful. The director of the Political Affairs Division of the Bureau, Mr. Wang, studied political economy in France. He lives a simple life, just like the soldiers. The Deputy Battalion Commander, Mr. Wu, is a graduate of Whampoa Military Academy and has served as a company commander and battalion commander. He is very loyal. The Company Commander, Mr. Song, used to belong to Liu Wenhui's troops. He served as a battalion commander, and he was brave and good at fighting. Once, he was seriously injured in an internal conflict. After he recovered, he became enlightened, left Liu's troops, and joined the Gorge Defense Bureau. The reporter talked with him, asking about his military experience. Mr. Song spoke frankly, saying, "The life of the army in the past was a life of all evil." He also described the various evils of the Sichuan warlords, and his indignation overflowed from his words. The reporter then asked him about his thoughts on the national crisis. Mr. Song replied indignantly, "As long as there is an opportunity to sacrifice for the country, I will not hesitate to go." His enthusiastic spirit was evident. The annual income of the Gorge Defense Bureau is about 80,000 yuan. The salaries of the staff are very low. The heads of each division receive a monthly salary of about thirty or forty yuan. The monthly salary of the staff is from ten to twenty yuan. Students who graduate from the Youth Volunteer Team and enter the bureau receive a monthly salary of eight yuan. After deducting more than three yuan for food expenses and about half a yuan for laundry and haircuts, the cost of uniforms is also deducted from the salary, so there is very little left.</p>
<p>The enterprises affiliated to the Gorge Defense Bureau include: (1) The Gorge Area Local Hospital, located in Beibei, is converted from an old temple. The scale is quite small. There is one director, one obstetrician-gynecologist, and several nurses. The fees for patients are very low, and free medical care is provided for the poor and sick. The annual income from registration fees, medical expenses, and delivery fees is about 700 yuan. The deficit is subsidized by the Gorge Defense Bureau. (2) The Jialing River Daily, edited and published by the Political Affairs Division of the Gorge Bureau. Initially, it was a tri-weekly publication. In October of the 17th year of the Republic, it was changed to an intermittent publication. In January of the 20th year, it was changed to a daily publication. Each day, a small sheet is printed. The content focuses on national defense, industry, transportation, and cultural news. The supplement focuses on modern new inventions, new discoveries, new records, and new activities, which is quite representative of the consistent spirit of Beibei's construction. The editor, Mr. Pan Bihai, has a lot of research and experience in rural construction. (3) The Gorge Area Reformatory is still in preparation. The reporter visited the streets, hospitals, libraries, public parks, and people's clubs (teahouses) in Beibei Town and saw that the streets were clean, and the residents also paid attention to hygiene and observed order. Most of the roads were built by the townspeople under the leadership of the Gorge Defense Bureau, so the cost was low and the construction was good. According to someone, "Beibei has now reached the point where doors are not locked at night, and only the road is not picked up. But ten years ago, it was an area where banditry occurred from time to time."</p>
<h3>Hydraulic Engineering Laboratory in Tianjin Completed and Opened—The Only Hydraulic Experiment Institution in the Country</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence. The new construction of the First Hydraulic Engineering Laboratory in China, the only Yongli experiment institution in the country, has been under construction for many years and was completed on the 12th of this month. Coincidentally, the Chinese Hydraulic Engineering Society and the Hebei Provincial Engineering Association held a joint annual meeting in Tianjin, so the institute took the opportunity to hold an opening ceremony and conduct a water release test at the same time. More than 100 guests attended that day. Li Yizhi presided over the meeting and reported on the significance of the construction. Then, the director of the institute, Li Fudu, reported on the construction process. Finally, Director Li Shutian gave a speech. The ceremony ended at 12:00. Li Yizhi released water for the test, and the results were excellent.</p>
<p>According to the report by the director of the institute, Li Fudu, the First Hydraulic Engineering Laboratory in China was jointly established by the Yellow River, Huai River, North China, and Yangtze River four hydraulic committees, the Hebei Provincial Industrial College, the National Beiyang Institute of Technology, the Construction Committee, the Model Irrigation Administration, and the Shaanxi Water Conservancy Bureau eight institutions. When the North China Water Conservancy Committee was completed in the 17th year of the Republic, the Chairman, Li Yizhi, and the Standing Committee Member, Li Shutian, had personally visited major hydraulic engineering laboratories in Europe and the United States. They deeply believed that solving various hydraulic engineering problems required a hydraulic engineering laboratory. Therefore, the North China Water Conservancy Committee proposed a plan to establish a hydraulic engineering laboratory at its general meeting and suggested it to the Construction Committee. However, the plan was shelved due to the failure to allocate funds. In the 22nd year of the Republic, the director of the institute represented the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan to participate in the Yellow River test in Germany. At that time, the plan for the hydraulic engineering laboratory was reviewed by Professors Engel and Fangsius, who considered it appropriate. After returning to China, the director reported to the North China Water Conservancy Committee, which then held a meeting with the Yellow River, Huai River, and other seven institutions to organize the board of directors. Construction began in the spring of last year, and the total cost was over 157,900 yuan, which was donated by various participating institutions and national hydraulic institutions and subsidized by the Construction Committee. The regular expenses were set at 1,000 yuan per month. The Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee and the North China Water Conservancy Committee each bear 350 yuan, the Hebei Provincial Industrial College allocates 200 yuan, and the National Beiyang Institute of Technology allocates 100 yuan. The tests are divided into preparatory and formal types: A. Preparatory Tests (1) Yellow River River Preparatory Test, (2) Yellow Earth Sedimentation Test. B. Formal Tests (1) Muddy Water Flow Test, (2) Reservoir Sedimentation Test, (3) Yellow Earth River Fundamental Policy Test, (4) Yellow Earth River Local Engineering Test, (5) Guanting Dam Energy Dissipation Test. After the opening ceremony on the 12th, the tests began. The institute is 70 meters long from east to west and 30 meters wide from north to south. There are two water storage tanks at the rear, about 30 meters high. Below is a reservoir. During the test, tap water is injected into the reservoir, and water is pumped to the aerial water tank by a water pump. Then, the water is passed into various test models through water pipes. The water level and flow rate are measured with instruments. In front of the reservoir is the Guanting Dam energy dissipation test model, which is used to study how the Guanting Dam in the upper reaches of the Yongding River can prevent sediment erosion. Further ahead is the Yellow Earth River model, which stretches for more than 20 meters and meanders. There is a river channel in the middle, only a foot wide, and the banks are made of yellow earth. In the initial Guanting Dam release test, it was seen that the flood passed through the water barrier dam, and the water勢 was turbulent. Gradually, the flow became stable. The test lasted for an hour, and the results were very good. This was commissioned by the Yongding River Engineering Office and tested ahead of schedule. The next test was the Yellow Earth River model and the sedimentation situation. After the water flow was injected into the model, it was gradually seen that the river bank near the water was scoured by the water flow, and most of it was submerged. The flood was turbulent, and there were many vortexes. This test clearly showed the situation along the Yellow River. The test lasted about half an hour. The management of the institute is handled by a board of directors consisting of one director from each of the eight institutions. Li Yizhi was appointed as the chairman of the board of directors, totaling nine directors and chairman. All are honorary positions with a term of three years, and one-third are re-elected each year. After this opening, the preparatory tests will be carried out immediately. (13th)</p>
<h3>Situation in Guangzhou After Currency Management—A Glimpse of the Market—Prices About 20% Higher Than Before—Silver Shops and Banks Have Resumed Business</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence. Since the Finance Department announced the currency management measures, although citizens felt slightly inconvenient about the abolition of the silver coin system, there was not much disturbance in the market. However, due to the hasty reform of the system, silver coins lost their value as currency. There was a temporary shortage of auxiliary currency. The one-dime banknotes issued by provincial and municipal banks on weekdays were insufficient for circulation. The Provincial Bank has now issued the five-dime silver coin auxiliary currency that was prepared a few days ago. At the same time, the Guangzhou Municipal Bank has also issued a two-dime auxiliary currency, scheduled to be issued on the 9th. This auxiliary currency is 4 and a half inches long and 2 and one-half inches wide. The front is printed with a half-length portrait of Sun Yat-sen, and the top is the city emblem. The back is printed with the Pearl River Railway Bridge. After the issuance of the above two silver coin auxiliary currencies, the petty transactions in the market will not be as difficult as on the first day, because there is enough auxiliary currency to replace the two-dime silver coins. In recent days, citizens and businesses have been taking silver coins to provincial and municipal banks to exchange for legal tender in an endless stream. As of the evening of the 8th, provincial and municipal banks had recovered 2 million yuan of silver from the market. Those who registered with the Chamber of Commerce to exchange silver for legal tender also amounted to 1 million yuan. In the future, when silver from various counties and cities is successively concentrated in the provincial capital, the number should also be considerable. At present, the government is actively preparing for the Issuance Preparation Management Committee, which should be established in a few days. Recently, in order to facilitate citizens to exchange silver for legal tender, in addition to extending the business hours of the Provincial Bank to 6:00 PM, it has also entrusted Henglong, Dexing, Taicheng, and other silver shops on Thirteenth Street to exchange on its behalf at the prescribed value. Since the government announced that provincial and municipal silver coin auxiliary currency is legal tender, prices have inevitably increased slightly. According to Article 3 of the currency management measures, silver coins are exchanged for legal tender silver coin auxiliary currency at a rate of 1.20 yuan, so the value of legal tender is only 80% of the value of silver. Therefore, ordinary merchants and citizens have calculated according to this discount. Goods that were usually worth one yuan have recently been increased to 1.20 yuan. At the same time, due to the loss of value of the two-dime silver coin and the lack of auxiliary currency, copper coins have risen in price. Usually, one dime of silver coins can be exchanged for 32 copper coins, but now one dime of legal tender can only be exchanged for 26 copper coins. According to general speculation, once the supply and demand of legal tender correspond and the government cancels the additional purchase of silver coins, prices should return to normal.</p>
<p>After the currency management order was issued, silver shops were concerned about disputes arising from mortgage contracts and closed down for one day. Private banks and post office savings bureaus also closed for one day due to the relationship between legal tender and silver coin transactions, fearing disputes. They also sent staff to the Finance Department to request further announcements of measures to be followed. The Finance Department then issued a notice stating, "According to Article 5 of the six currency management measures announced by this department for implementation, all contracts concluded in silver coin units before November 6 shall be converted to the originally agreed amount and settled in legal tender on the due date." The so-called contracts concluded in silver coin units refer to silver deposit books, silver deposit receipts, and promissory notes of banks and silver shops. Those with opening accounts, which are of a deposit nature, are not included. This has been clearly explained. However, the general public still has doubts about the words "amount" and "contract." Now, we will add an interpretation. For example, if Mr. A deposits 1,000 yuan in a bank or silver shop, or a bank or silver shop lends 1,000 yuan to a business, and the deposits and loans are all in silver coins, then on the due date, they shall be settled with 1,000 yuan of legal tender plus interest (i.e., one yuan of the original silver coin is exchanged for one yuan of legal tender). All other sales, purchase, and loan contracts of businesses and private individuals shall be handled in this way and shall not be obstinate. This is a special announcement. General silver shops, banks, and postal savings bureaus, having received this clear explanation, resumed business on the 8th and posted the above notice. In the future, withdrawals will be paid in legal tender. (November 9th)</p>
<h3>Shantou Civil Servants Stealing Silver for Export—Customs Seized People and Evidence</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence. Since the authorities promulgated the currency reform measures, the East District Pacification Commissioner's Office and the Shantou Municipal Government also received the promulgated measures for punishing the smuggling of silver for export. Those who destroy silver coins will be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than one year but not more than seven years and fined not more than 1,000 yuan. Those who intend to profit by privately transporting silver coins, silver bars, and silver ingots for export will be sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or imprisonment for a term of not less than seven years and fined not less than five times the value of the smuggled goods. This notice was posted throughout the city by the Shantou Municipal Government on the 7th, and the counties of Chaozhou and Meizhou were also instructed to forward and post it to inform all the people. Since the currency reform, silver coins have no longer been used in market transactions, so the prices of silver dollars and silver ingots have plummeted, shrinking by 120 yuan per 1,000 yuan. The Bank of China specially telegraphed its Shanghai headquarters to quickly transport 4 million yuan of legal tender to Shantou for exchange to facilitate circulation. The Provincial Bank also announced that all tax revenues would be based on provincial banknotes as the standard legal tender. The Customs Tax Office has changed to collecting central banknotes. Since silver in the market has depreciated due to its inability to circulate, foreign merchants are absorbing silver to profit in Hong Kong. It is said that 100 yuan can earn more than 30 yuan in profit. Where there is profit, there are many people who smuggle silver for export. On the afternoon of the 8th, the new Customs ship sailed from Shantou to Hong Kong. The customs inspectors searched the ship very thoroughly. Suddenly, they saw a suspicious person boarding the ship. The customs officers immediately searched him. At first, this person was full of official authority. As a result, 80 silver dollars were found on his body. The customs officers initially did not know who he was and planned to take him and the silver to the Customs Office for handling. Unexpectedly, the person raised his head and patted his chest, saying to the customs officers, "Don't you recognize me?" He then showed his badge to the customs officers. He was a civil servant of the Chaozhou-Meizhou Anti-Smoking Bureau. He thought he could rely on his official position to avoid being searched. However, the customs officers said that since he was a civil servant, how could he violate the law? So, they ordered the customs soldiers to take him back to the Customs Office and then send him to the Customs Superintendent's Office for interrogation. The citizens are paying close attention to whether the law will be enforced. It is also heard that this person holds several positions and is also one of the influential figures in Shantou. He coveted this small profit and violated the national law. The government should severely punish him. (9th)</p>
<h3>Former Palace Museum Theft Case - Second Instance Concluded - Court Determines Xiao and Liu Committed Criminal Acts</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang News: The former Palace Museum theft case was previously interrogated by the Jiangning District Court. Xiao Xiangpei and Liu Guang'e were held responsible for safekeeping. Although the main culprits Yi Peiji and Li Zongtong were at large and unapprehendable for direct confrontation, it was confirmed that Xiao and Liu had committed the crimes of embezzlement and damage. Xiao was sentenced to one year and four months of imprisonment, and Liu to eight months. Xiao and Liu appealed, dissatisfied with the verdict. The High Court designated the Zhenjiang Fifth Branch as the court of second instance and held three hearings. Due to incomplete investigation of witnesses, a fourth hearing was held at 10:00 AM on the 14th, presided over by Wang Jian, the chief judge of the criminal court, with Wu and Jin as assisting judges, and Prosecutor Yun Zhenbang. First, the appellants Xiao and Liu were interrogated about the circumstances of the theft. Xiao and Liu stated that they assumed their posts in the 21st year [of the Republic], and the artifacts were transported to Shanghai in the 22nd year. They were completely unaware of the circumstances at the time. However, each time the seals were opened, police and security teams were present to monitor, and someone was recording. How could there have been any possibility of swapping? The storage rooms were all sealed. When opening the storage, personnel from the Secretariat would jointly handle the process with the police. The keys and opening of the storage were managed by dedicated personnel. During the southward transportation, specialists conducted random checks. When Presidents Yi and Ma handed over their duties, they did not count the inventory of antiquities. They were unaware at the time whether the various jewels, treasures, and paintings were genuine or fake. Therefore, the appellants bear no responsibility whatsoever. Subsequently, the prosecutor read out the reasons for the prosecution, stating briefly that in the 22nd year of the Republic, during the southward transportation of antiquities, the defendants, taking advantage of the transportation, swapped genuine artifacts with fake ones, embezzling public property. After individual interrogation by the investigation court of the Jiangning District Court, it was confirmed that criminal acts had occurred. From various observations, the appellants did commit criminal acts and should still be subject to the original judgment. Finally, Zhao Yaqing and Xiang Guojie, the lawyers of Xiao and Liu, stood up to defend their clients, presenting reasons and requesting the court to consult the inventory of the Palace Museum. The court, considering the reasons presented by the two lawyers as worthy of reference, ordered them to submit written defenses and agreed to consult the inventory. Afterwards, the case was declared concluded, and the sentence was scheduled to be announced at 2:00 PM on the 16th. Xiao was returned to custody, and Liu was released on his original bail. The court adjourned around 1:00 PM.</p>
<p>Suzhou: Public Prostitution Registration Begins Yesterday</p>
<p>Zhang Hanwei, the Chief of the Public Security Bureau, recognizing the prevalence of private prostitution in Suzhou, despite strict prohibitions by the authorities, where the prohibiting continues and the prostitution continues, has decided to implement public prostitution. A public prostitution plan was drafted, designating the area outside the Changmen Gate Road as the public prostitution zone, divided into three classes, with donations levied according to class. The plan was submitted to the Provincial Government for approval. A public prostitution registration office was established within the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau outside the Changmen Gate, appointing Branch Chief Xu Jingqing as the director of the registration office. Registration began on the 15th, with a deadline of one week. The registration fee for the first class is twenty yuan, ten yuan for the second class, and five yuan for the third class. After the registration is completed, it will be sent to the General Bureau for review and examination for venereal diseases, and then business licenses will be issued to start business with hanging signs. It is heard that there are many private prostitutes in Suzhou, totaling approximately five hundred or more. The 15th was the first day of registration, and only dozens of second and third-class prostitutes went to register. The first-class prostitutes (i.e., those who want to be called "changsan") are dissatisfied with the public prostitution measures set by the Public Security Bureau, so no one went to register. They are currently requesting amendments to the measures. The opening date is reportedly December 1st. It is expected that the market outside Jinlumen Gate will develop in the future.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Progress of Repairing Guangqin Road</p>
<p>Guangqin Road in Zhou Shanbang, this county, connects to Xihu Road. It is a necessary route for Xihu buses. The original stone slab surface is severely damaged, uneven, and rugged, making it quite dangerous for vehicles to travel. The Wuxi Station of Xihu Bus Company sent a letter to the County Construction Bureau requesting personnel to investigate and find a way to repair it. Director Zhang, upon receiving the letter, immediately consulted with Wang Zongshan, the director of the Engineering Department of the company, and engineer Xu Shousong. The estimated repair cost is over seven hundred yuan. The Construction Bureau proposed that during the repair period, Xihu buses should not directly reach Xihu Station and should only go as far as the intersection of Xihu Road to facilitate the progress of the project. However, Wang and Xu proposed that the vehicles continue to operate as usual and that the road surface be repaired in two parts to maintain traffic. Wang and Xu have already returned to Shanghai and will report the negotiation to General Manager Wang Xiaolai for a decision. As for the sunken parts of the road, Station Manager Hu of Xihu Station has purchased yellow sand and crushed stones and hired workers to pave and level them to avoid danger.</p>
<p>Hangzhou: Transferring Auxiliary Coins and Copper Coins from Various Counties under Liu's Control</p>
<p>To prevent unscrupulous merchants from speculating and manipulating the auxiliary coins and copper coins on the market and affecting finance, the Hangzhou Municipal Government Chamber of Commerce, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications had previously agreed on a method of transferring funds under Liu's control and submitted it to the head office for implementation. Considering that the method only applies to Hangzhou City and that the counties still arbitrarily manipulate price fluctuations, and that Shaoxing and Ningbo have remittance relations with Hangzhou, the impact on the money industry is significant. On the 15th, the Qianye representatives of the three provinces of China, China, and Jiaotong convened a meeting again at the Central Bank and decided on the following measures: (1) Each legal tender in each county will be worth 12 jiao of auxiliary coins and 3,000 wen of copper coins. (2) Branches of the three banks may exchange legal tender for legal tender at any time, or exchange legal tender for auxiliary coins and copper coins to avoid surplus or shortage. Those who do not have branches should exchange them at neighboring county branches. (3) The Finance Department, the Chamber of Commerce, and the three banks will separately order the county governments, chambers of commerce, and branches of each county to comply with the measures.</p>
<h3>Southern Yudu Section to be Completed in Early Next Month</h3>
<p>The Southern Yudu section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway project has been rushing to lay steel rails in four sections, and the main part of the project has been completed. However, the bridge project is progressing somewhat slowly. Liangjiadu is expected to be completed on the 25th of this month. The completion of the Guixi wooden bridge has been delayed until early December due to the rapid flow of water and construction difficulties. The opening ceremony may have to be held on New Year's Day next year.</p>
<p>Scientific Discourse</p>
<h3>The Development and Application of the Brain - Edited by the Chinese Science Society</h3>
<p>— Lu Yudao</p>
<p>1.  The Location of Ingenuity - The Brain</p>
<p>We all know that humans are the most intelligent of all beings. Where exactly is the location of this ingenuity? Three hundred years ago, a French philosopher named Descartes said that the soul resides in a small pineal body (Pinepb Body) in the brain. Vital energy emanates from the pineal body and reaches the entire body through the nerve tubes. Now we know that this is not the case. Our soul does not reside in this small pineal body, nor is our body's movement directed by this small pineal body. Our ingenuity lies in the brain inside the skull. It now seems to be common knowledge that the brain is the master of our behavior.</p>
<p>Flies have little ingenuity because they have no brain. Their brain consists of only a few small ganglia, about one-tenth the size of a millet grain. Fish have a definite brain. For example, the brain of a carp is inside the skull, but it weighs only 0.93 grams. Chickens are slightly higher, with a brain weighing 3.4 grams. We generally agree that chickens are smarter than fish. Why are they smarter? Naturally, because their brain is heavier and larger. Looking at dogs, they can listen to their owners and guard the door, so they are naturally smarter than chickens. Their brain weighs about 100 grams. We humans are the most intelligent of all beings. Humans can conquer everything in the natural world, and their brain is also the heaviest, weighing about 1,400 grams. There are still animals with heavier brains than humans, such as elephants, whose brains weigh 4,660 grams. However, we can imagine that although their body area is eleven times larger than humans, their brain only weighs three times as much. Therefore, in terms of body area, the brain-to-body ratio of elephants is 2.89, while that of humans is 9.4, which is more than three times greater. Therefore, the development of the human brain is evident.</p>
<p>Professor T. Wingate Todd of Cleveland, Ohio, USA, has been carefully measuring the volume of human brains since 1913. He said that the brain volume of ordinary white adults is 1500 c.c. However, the brains of poor people obtained between 1913 and 1917 had a volume of 1480 c.c. By 1918, it had dropped to 1410 c.c. This is strange because in that year, most people went to serve in the army or work, and only the most useless were left behind. After the end of the European War in 1919, all industries stagnated, the army was disbanded, and society could not accommodate so many people, so unemployment increased. The average brain volume of poor people reached 1520 c.c. Social leaders all predicted that the social situation would improve next year. Sure enough, the brain volume in 1920 dropped to the pre-war level. By the following year (1921), all industries had regressed again, and the results rose again to 1550 c.c. From this, it can be seen that in a prosperous society, the brains obtained are smaller, because those with a little ability can find a job, and those left behind have smaller brain volumes. When there are many unemployed people in society, there is a phenomenon of competition for survival, and those with slightly inferior brains are impoverished. Even ordinary people are often unemployed, so the brain volume obtained is also larger. The high and low brain volumes collected by Professor Todd are nothing less than a barometer of the prosperity of society. It can also be seen the relationship between brain volume and intelligence.</p>
<p>2.  The Various Parts of the Brain</p>
<p>The most important part of the brain is inside the skull. The skull is like the capital of a country, and an organism is like a country. All events in a country can reach the central government. News from all parts of the human body can also be transmitted to the brain. The transmission is done by many nerves acting as transmission lines. Therefore, every part of our body, from the slightest hair to every part of the viscera, is indirectly connected to the brain by nerves. Those that are commonly in contact with the outside world in the body and those that control the autonomous movement of the flesh are called the cerebrospinal system, while those that control the functions of the viscera are called the sympathetic or autonomic system. The latter is named because the movements of the viscera cannot be controlled autonomously. We can command our fingers and arms to move, but we cannot tell our stomach and intestines how to move or not to move. But whether it is the cerebrospinal system or the sympathetic system, its nerves first pass through the spinal cord (or spinal brain) inside the vertebrae. This is the lowest part of the central nervous system (or brain). There are a total of thirty-one pairs of nerves entering the spinal cord in the human body.</p>
<p>One level higher than the spinal cord is the medulla oblongata or the extended brain. It is located in the lower back of our skull. The nerves that control the sensation and movement of the head, in addition to five pairs of nerves, have seven pairs that all go to this location, and from there go to the brain above. At the same time, the nerve pathways transmitted from the spinal brain and the lines from the upper part of the brain that send commands to the periphery of the body also pass through this location.</p>
<p>Further up are the cerebellum and the pons, these two closely connected areas. The function of the cerebellum has independent properties, namely to control the body's balance and muscle regulation. When we see a friend, we should not shake hands too loosely, but we should not shake them too tightly. The same is true when a mother holds a child. If it is too loose, the child will slip out of her hands, and if it is too tight, the child will suffocate. These are all regulated by the cerebellum. Also, we usually alternate our left and right feet when walking forward. When each foot is raised, the other foot must support the body. This alternating support and balance is also the responsibility of the cerebellum, which ensures that the muscles of the two legs exert force appropriately.</p>
<p>From the cerebellum and pons, there is a small section of the midbrain, which is specifically responsible for visual reflexes such as blinking and auditory reflexes. The visual and auditory reflexes that it controls are all involuntary. Therefore, it is called the visual and auditory reflex center. Lower animals do not appear to be much different from humans in this area. On the contrary, if an eagle's eyes play an important role in its life, then the brain part of the visual reflex center is also particularly developed.</p>
<p>One level above that is the thalamus or interbrain, which is the area where all sensations converge, the emotion center, and the center for controlling the function of the viscera. All the joys, angers, sorrows, and joys of mankind originate from this place.</p>
<p>The highest center of the brain is in the two hemispheres of the cerebrum. All sensations come to this place, all voluntary movement commands originate from this place, all thoughts and creations, all the songs composed by musicians, and all the new inventions of scientists also originate from this place. This is where humans are more intelligent than animals, and where geniuses are more intelligent than ordinary people. The most wonderful thing is that the gray matter on the surface of the hemisphere is only 3mm thick, and this place is full of nerve cells. There are a total of 920 million cells in this place. The human brain is located in the place where these 920 million cells are located.</p>
<p>The brain manages the movements of various parts of the human body, just like the government manages various places. Under the central government, there are provincial governments, under the provincial governments, there are county governments, under the county, there are districts, under the district, there are townships, and under the township, there are villages. The human nervous system is nothing less than a complete political organization. Generally speaking, the spinal brain controls reactions, the medulla oblongata and midbrain control instincts, the cerebellum controls the balance of the body's muscles, the interbrain controls emotions, and the cerebrum controls intelligence.</p>
<p>3.  The Development of Brain Function</p>
<p>The above is all about the functions of the various parts of the adult brain. All animals gradually develop from embryo to maturity, and the brain is no exception. Therefore, the brain of a child is very different from the brain of an adult, and its function gradually develops.</p>
<p>The human body takes shape two months after conception. But the heart beats at three weeks, and the gastrointestinal digestive tract has peristalsis at seven weeks. The chest and abdomen can move in the fourth month. These visceral movements occur first, which indicates that the function of the sympathetic autonomic nervous system is first present. In the sixth month, if the fetus is stimulated in the mouth and tongue, it will have a sucking reaction. By the seventh month, the muscles in various parts of the body can have many reactions, such as knee-jerk reflexes and plantar reflexes. However, the tendon reflexes of the upper limbs will have to wait until after birth. By the eighth and ninth months, the muscle reaction is . Usually, it can be felt in the fourth or fifth month. The fetus moves more clearly when it is about to give birth. Not only can the fetus move in the mother's body, but it can also feel. Thirty-one days before a mother was about to give birth, she was washing herself in a bathtub with warm water. A two-year-old child was playing on the ground next to the bathtub. Accidentally, the small glass bottle in his hand hit the edge of the bathtub. The mother was lying down and didn't feel anything, but the fetus in her body suddenly jumped. This shows that the fetus can already hear in the abdomen. The above shows the gradual discovery of the function of the cerebrospinal nervous system.</p>
<p>Not only is the infant so before birth, but its actions also gradually develop after birth. A newborn baby can only lie down and cannot turn over. By the first month, he can lift his head. By the second month, he can lift his chest. By the third month, when lying on his back, he can reach for an object. By the fourth month, he can sit with support. By the fifth month, he can sit on his lap and play with toys. By the sixth month, he can play sitting in a chair. By the seventh month, he can sit on his own without support. By the eighth month, he can stand with support. By the ninth month, he can stand by a chair. By the tenth month, he can crawl. By the eleventh month, he can walk by leading his hand. By the twelfth month, he can stand by pushing furniture on his own. By the thirteenth month, he can climb stairs. By the fourteenth month, he can stand on his own. By the fifteenth month, he can walk on his own. For normal infants with sound development, the development of their movements is generally like this. Later, they learn to speak, learn to write, and grow into adults.</p>
<p>However, the brain parts involved in the various actions mentioned above are too complicated. The study of the development of brain tissue and the development of behavior and movement is more complete in lower animals. Such as cats, guinea pigs, white rats, snails, etc. For example, walking, the entire action naturally includes many nerve molecules. But the most important center is the cerebellum. Goats can walk when they are born, so if you observe their cerebellar cortex at this time, it is also fully developed. Puppies can only walk three weeks after birth, so the cerebellar cortex is not fully developed at birth, and it is fully developed by the third week. People can only walk between the fifteenth and eighteenth months after birth. During these eighteen months, the gradual development of the cerebellar cortex can also be seen. It can be seen the relationship between cerebellar development and walking ability.</p>
<p>In the central nervous system, in addition to the nerve center, there are also nerve pathways that connect various centers, which play an important role. These pathways are composed of nerve fibers. Nerve fibers are covered with a layer of sheath, called the myelin sheath. The development of the myelin sheath in each pathway occurs at different times. Generally, the pathways for functions that develop earlier often have myelin sheaths that develop earlier, and the myelin sheaths of functions that develop later develop later. This also shows the mutual relationship between the development of nerve tissue and nerve function. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Municipal Government - Prohibits Residents from Moving and Students from Skipping Class</h3>
<p>Hopes Citizens Will - Use Common Sense to Judge Rumors - Observe the Situation Calmly</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Municipal Government, considering that rumors persist despite repeated clarifications and that migrants have been moving in droves in recent days, further unsettling citizens, has ordered the Public Security Bureau to prohibit all residents in the urban area from moving, unless approved by the branch of the Public Security Bureau in charge, otherwise they will be deemed to be disrupting public order. The Municipal Government has also ordered the Education Bureau to order all schools to continue classes as usual and not allow students to ask for leave or leave school without reason, otherwise the school principal will be held accountable.

<h3>Recent Developments in International Trade: Hope for Future Balance</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, international trade has been quite bleak recently since the outbreak of the Italian-Ethiopian war. In addition, the government's implementation of currency reform has led to a significant reduction in the import of foreign goods due to higher costs. On the export side, only essential raw materials are being traded. Foreign manufacturers are all taking a wait-and-see approach. Reporters learned from the International Trade Bureau in this city that the main export from China recently has been tung oil, while exports of furs and raw silk are still decent. Tea is only being sold to Europe, and there have been recent orders from France, with black tea selling particularly well. With intense competition from various countries, the future is bleak without immediate improvements. Honey tea, made by mixing honey into tea, is currently popular in Europe and America, and all the honey from Chinese farms has been sold out. It is a pity that bee species have not yet been fully perfected. Overall, the recent trade situation suggests that there is hope for a balance in China's foreign trade in the future, and that there will not be a large trade deficit.</p>
<h3>Second Cotton Production Estimate Report for This Year Released by the China Cotton Statistics Association</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the China Cotton Statistics Association released its second cotton production estimate report for the country this year yesterday (the 15th) at 5:00 PM: 1. The total area of cotton fields is 35,485,818 mu, the area of abandoned fields is 12,291,300 mu, and the cotton yield is 8,391,018 dan. Compared to the first estimate of this year's yield, it is reduced by 1,205,666 dan, and compared to the actual yield of 1934, it is reduced by 2,810,981 dan. 2. The reduction in cotton field area and yield this year is due to the drought in the Yellow River basin during the sowing season and the floods in the Yangtze River basin in the autumn, which severely damaged cotton fields. During the cotton picking season, the Yangtze River basin also suffered from overcast and rainy weather and insect pests in Jiangsu, so the estimated yield was further reduced compared to the first estimate. The average yield per mu is 23.6 jin, while in 1934 it was 23.9 jin. The harvest this year is generally similar to last year. 3. Among the provinces, Jiangsu has the largest cotton field area this year, with 10 million mu, followed by Hebei with 6.31 million mu, Hubei with 4.56 million mu, Shaanxi with 3.86 million mu, Shandong and Hebei both with 1.7 million mu, Sichuan with 1.9 million mu, Zhejiang with 1.86 million mu, and Shanxi with 1 million mu. The water and drought disasters this year are the most severe in recent history. The area of cotton fields that became abandoned fields due to disasters is 3.97 million mu in Hubei, which is equal to the current area of cotton fields, 3.77 million mu in Shandong, and 3.15 million mu in Henan, both of which are more than double the current area of cotton fields. 4. Among the provinces, Hebei has the largest cotton production this year, with 2.16 million dan, followed by Jiangsu with 2.02 million dan, Hubei and Shaanxi both with 970,000 dan, Zhejiang with 460,000 dan, Henan with 420,000 dan, Shandong with 410,000 dan, Sichuan with 440,000 dan, Anhui with 280,000 dan, and Shanxi with 250,000 dan.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Approves Stamp Duty Method for Return Slips</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has approved the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's request for instructions on whether to affix stamp duty to return slips and exchange slips, stating: "The telegram and attachments have been received. As the stamp duty law does not stipulate that stamp duty should be paid on return slips, it is not necessary to affix stamps. However, the purple return slip from the China Water Bottle Factory submitted in the telegram, which serves as a receipt issued to customers by the factory after receiving returned goods, should be stamped according to the regulations for receipts for goods. As for exchange slips, if they are only used for exchanging goods, it is not necessary to affix stamps. However, upon examining the exchange slip from the China Water Bottle Factory, which contains a signature area for the recipient, it also has the nature of a receipt and should still be stamped according to the regulations for receipts for goods. The stub can be exempted from stamping according to the precedent. Please instruct accordingly." This is the approval.</p>

<h3>Silk Industry Appeals for Negotiations with France: Vietnam Imposes Heavy Import Taxes on Chinese Silk. Previously Only Regular Taxes, Now Additional Taxes Added When No Treaty Existed. Currently, Besides Regular Taxes and Additional Taxes, a Balance Tax is Also Added.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Electrical Silk Weaving Factory Industry and the Silk Satin Industry Associations have jointly stated that they have repeatedly received urgent letters from the Annam Touan and Xiti Silk Satin Industry Associations, stating that since the announcement of the Sino-French-Vietnamese treaty, the import tax rate levied by Vietnam on Chinese silk has not only failed to enjoy preferential tax reductions as stipulated in the treaty, but is actually heavier than the tax rate when there was no treaty. Furthermore, many tax items have been cleverly created, and arbitrary valuations and heavy levies are imposed. The associations believe that the supplementary table of the commercial treaty stipulates that Chinese silk exported to Vietnam should enjoy the lowest tax rate to show reciprocity. However, the Vietnamese customs are now imposing arbitrary and heavy levies, which violates the spirit of reciprocity. The export of Chinese silk to Vietnam is likely to be completely eliminated. The chairmen of the two industry associations, Cha Shengbai and Luo Qinghua, immediately reported the situation to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting serious negotiations with the French government to help the export of Chinese silk. The original report is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Request for Negotiations</p>
<p>The report is regarding the fact that after the announcement and implementation of the Sino-French-Vietnamese treaty, Chinese silk exported to Vietnam should enjoy the lowest tax rate as stipulated in the supplementary table. However, the Vietnamese customs are now creating tax items cleverly, arbitrarily valuing goods, and imposing heavy levies, which are even heavier than the taxes levied when there was no treaty. Overseas Chinese merchants are suffering greatly, and the sales of Chinese silk have been cut off. The report is urgently submitted, requesting a prompt and serious negotiation with the French government to abolish any supplementary taxes other than those stipulated in the commercial treaty, in order to comply with the principle of reciprocity and help the country's foreign trade. It is noted that the import of Chinese silk to Annam before 1726 amounted to more than 10 million yuan per year. Since the Qing Dynasty, when China and Annam signed a commercial treaty, Chinese silk enjoyed the most-favored-nation tax rate. Therefore, the sales of silk to Vietnam at that time were particularly prosperous. In July 1929, the Sino-Vietnamese commercial treaty expired, and the import of Chinese silk had to be treated in the same way as ordinary taxes for countries without a treaty. In the past, only one type of regular tax was levied on Chinese silk. However, in addition to the regular tax, an additional establishment tax (similar to the business tax in our country) had to be levied. From then on, the burden on overseas Chinese increased, and the sales of Chinese silk were greatly affected. In 1930, Wang Qian, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of our country, and French Minister Ma De negotiated a special treaty. However, due to the relationship between the two types of supplementary tables, A and B, the French side delayed approval, which has been suspended for several years. During this period, the export of Chinese silk to Vietnam was almost completely cut off, and the business of overseas Chinese and the export of silk merchants in the country both suffered. On May 4th of this year, the Sino-French-Vietnamese treaty was fortunately announced. With the continued export of Chinese silk to Vietnam, it was expected that the old foundation would be restored. However, urgent letters were repeatedly received from the Annam Tuan and Xiti Silk Satin Industry Associations, stating that since the announcement of the commercial treaty, the Vietnamese customs have levied import tax rates on Chinese silk that have not only failed to be reduced, but have actually increased compared to when there was no treaty. Furthermore, many names have been cleverly created, and arbitrary and heavy levies have been imposed. Taking Chinese silk as an example, only regular tax was levied in the old treaty to show preferential treatment. Later, when there was no treaty, ordinary tax rates were applied, so in addition to the regular tax, an establishment tax was also levied. Now that the new treaty has been established, the establishment tax should be abolished in order to comply with the principle of reciprocity. However, recently, the Vietnamese customs have not only failed to remove the establishment tax, but have also added a balance tax, which is 25% of the assessed value. For example, the import of 100 kilograms of crepe-faced, lightweight, dyed pure silk fabric into Annam is subject to the following comparison of new and old tax rates: A. Tax rate under the old treaty: Regular tax: 1,360 francs. B. Tax rate when there was no treaty: Regular tax: 10,000 francs; Establishment tax: 900 francs; Total: 10,900 francs. C. Tax rate after the recent announcement of the commercial treaty: Regular tax: 8,500 francs; Establishment tax: 537.5 francs; Balance tax: 2,250 francs; Total: 11,287.5 francs. According to the above example, it can be proven that after the new treaty was signed, the Vietnamese customs' import tax rate on Chinese silk was not only heavier than the tax levied under the old treaty, but also increased more than the ordinary tax rate when there was no treaty. Although the added balance tax is said to be 25% of the value, it is assessed based on the exchange rate, which is actually arbitrarily inflated and has no standard. Sometimes it is even as high as 50%. The establishment tax is calculated by combining all costs and taxes paid, and then re-evaluating the value, which is like adding a bed on top of a bed, taxing taxes within taxes. Therefore, the total amount of import tax paid for Chinese silk is generally between 100% and 150% of the value. With such heavy taxation and extortion, overseas Chinese merchants cannot bear the burden. If Chinese silk wants to be exported to Vietnam, its vitality will inevitably be cut off. The associations are greatly distressed and cannot remain silent. They dare to truthfully report the situation, hoping that the departments concerned will investigate and approve, and request that the French government be seriously negotiated with, and that all supplementary taxes not stipulated in the main treaty and supplementary table be stopped from being levied by the Vietnamese side, and that it must be guaranteed that no cleverly created tax items will be arbitrarily levied in the future. The regular tax levied should also be noted and should not be higher than the import tax for non-reciprocal countries, in order to comply with the principle of the lowest tax rate in the supplementary table, so as to realize the spirit of reciprocity in the commercial treaty. If the French side delays and ignores the negotiations, then our government may also levy additional taxes on goods such as coal and rice transported from Annam to our country to show retaliation. Whether this is appropriate or not is up to you to decide. I am waiting anxiously for orders. In addition to the attached table comparing tax rates, this is presented respectfully.</p>
<p>Explanation: (1) From May 1926, the tax was increased from 200 francs to 800 francs per 100 kilograms. After October of the same year, it was increased to 1,360 francs. (2) From July 1929, in addition to the regular tax mentioned above, an establishment tax of 2% of the value was added. The lowest estimated value was 18,000 francs per 100 kilograms, and the tax was 360 francs per 100 kilograms. (3) In July 1929, the Sino-French commercial treaty expired, and our country lost the most-favored-nation tax rate and was treated at the ordinary rate for countries without a treaty. (4) In January 1933, the establishment tax was again increased to 5% of the value. (5) On August 8, 1935, the new tax rules were implemented. The regular tax was slightly reduced, but the establishment tax was not canceled, and the French side established a separate item called the balance tax. Combining the various tax items, there was no reduction, and the tax was actually heavier than when there was no treaty.</p>

<h3>Boy Scouts' Internal Fundraising a Success</h3>
<p>The floods this year have caused severe disasters in the Zhongting, Guanhe, and Han rivers. The severity of the disaster is even worse than that of 1931. The disaster area covers dozens of provinces, and the number of victims exceeds millions. They are displaced and suffering unspeakable hardships. People from all walks of life are donating to help to the best of their ability to contribute to relief efforts. Although there are many people who do this, it is difficult to be comprehensive with such limited resources. The Water Disaster Relief Association in this city, due to the severity of the disaster and the urgency of relief efforts, has not only appealed for donations from all parties, but has also held various entertainment events to allocate all income to relief efforts. In addition, it has also held two types of fundraising: Boy Scout fundraising and general water disaster fundraising. The Boy Scouts' external fundraising has already been stopped, and their internal fundraising will also end in just two days. According to the person in charge of the Boy Scout Council, the income from this general mobilization of Boy Scout fundraising has been very satisfactory, and the amount should be in the tens of thousands of dollars. The detailed official figures will be announced as soon as the units of each regiment of soldiers have paid their dues. Within these two days, people from all walks of life are still encouraged to enthusiastically donate and make a final effort to help the disaster victims. In addition, the general water disaster fundraising organized by the Fundraising Group of the Association has been enthusiastically supported by various fundraising companies and stores, and the results have been excellent. Yesterday, the Association received 1,000 yuan from an old woman named Qiujiu, and Mr. Jiang Zhongquan collected 131.98 yuan from eight households, including Jiu Jun.</p>

In addition, the Baoding Christian United Water Disaster Relief Association has allocated a donation of 151.07 yuan. It is reported that the Association has collected funds and remitted them to the disaster area for distribution. Currently, donations are still pouring in from various places. The Association believes that as the winter season approaches and the weather becomes colder, millions of disaster victims are suffering from hunger and cold and are in dire need of assistance. It continues to appeal for relief from all walks of life.</p>

<h3>Jin Shou Lane - Tenants Request Rent Reduction Based on Precedent</h3>
<p>The houses in Jin Shou Lane on Shandong Road, located between Wuma Road and Wuhu Road west of Shanglin Street, are owned by the wealthy merchant Xi Hehan and managed by Taili Foreign Firm. The tenants of the lane, noting that landlords in neighboring areas have successively implemented rent reductions, with documented cases, have repeatedly gathered to request the owner to consider the merchants' difficulties and reduce the rent by 30%. However, the management office has been evasive and no agreement has been reached. Therefore, yesterday, the third lane-wide tenants' meeting was held at the South District Branch of the Municipal Association. Fifty-six families attended, including Pan Shiliang of Jiu Hua Inn, Zhu Huaibao of Italy, Zhang Wende of Nan Chang Feng, Yang Yusan of Hua Feng Yu, Mei Xiangde of Zheng Xing Long, and Liang Chuli of Guang Xin Feng. Qian Longzhang of Ding Yang Guan was elected as chairman. The chairman reported that landlords of Chinese and foreign properties in Shandong Road Sassoon Lane, Yuan Tai Lane, Jin Yu Lane, Zhonghua Lane, and Wangping Street have all implemented rent reductions with documented cases. The association has repeatedly sent letters through representatives to the management office requesting rent reduction, but there has been no response and no rent collection. The methods to be discussed should be proposed. The public resolved as follows: (1) Request a 30% rent reduction starting from September, and will not stop until the goal is achieved; (2) Engage lawyer Jiang Chiping as the association's legal advisor; (3) If the landlord does not collect the rent at 70%, all tenants will affix the association's seal and deposit the rent in the bank for safekeeping; (4) All tenants who receive lawyer's letters from the management office demanding rent or encounter legal disputes should report to the association so that the association's legal advisor can handle them; (5) Every five tenants will elect one representative to be responsible for handling disputes, which should be reported to the representative for the association to review and handle.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Xin Ji Bang Road</h3>

As a result, gold and silver jewelry was robbed, estimated to be worth over a hundred yuan. Fortunately, no one was injured.</p>
<h3>Nine Issuing Banks Guarantee Reserves, Central, China, and Communications Banks Separately Take Over</h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, after the Ministry of Finance issued a bulletin on currency system reform on the 4th of this month, the cash reserves of various banks and money shops have been checked and sealed by officials dispatched by the Ministry of Finance, or sold to the three banks. As for the nine banks issuing banknotes, their issuance reserves, consisting of 60% cash and 40% assets, have also been ordered by the Ministry of Finance to be taken over by the three banks. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Central, Communications Banks Take Over, Nine Banks Guarantee</p>
<p>After the Central, China, and Communications Banks were ordered to take over the issuance reserves of the nine banks issuing banknotes, consisting of 60% cash and 40% assets, the three banks, together with the Issuance Reserve Management Committee, decided on the takeover methods and allocated the takeover responsibilities. The Central Bank took over the China Agricultural and Industrial, China South, and Agricultural and Commercial Banks. The Bank of China took over the Siming, China Industrial, and China Farmers Banks. The Communications Bank took over the China Reclamation, China General Chamber of Commerce, and Zhejiang Xingye Banks. As for the 60% cash in the issuance reserves, due to the difficulty of transporting it and the frequent use of legal tender by the Central, China, and Communications Banks, and the scarcity of one-yuan legal tender notes, the cash will not be temporarily exchanged for legal tender. It will be temporarily sealed in the vaults of the respective banks.</p>
<p>40% Guarantee, Interest Paid Monthly</p>
<p>As for the 40% guarantee in the issuance reserves, which consists of government bonds, treasury bills, and other guaranteed assets, it has now been transferred to the Central, China, and Communications Banks for safekeeping. It is reported that interest must be paid monthly on these assets. A calculation will be made at the end of the month. However, among the 40% asset guarantees of the nine banks, there are items mortgaged to outsiders. If the debtor repays the loan and requests the return of the mortgaged item, it can be exchanged with the three banks at any time.</p>
<p>Branches and Sub-branches, Ministry Orders Separate Handling</p>
<p>As for branches and sub-branches in various regions, the Ministry of Finance has separately instructed the local authorities to handle them separately. For example, in Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangdong, branch committees of the Issuance Reserve Management Committee have been established. In nearby areas, the Management Committee will determine methods for joint management. However, the specific methods have not yet been fully determined.</p>
<p>Local Banks Not Yet Taken Over</p>
<p>In addition, such as Zhejiang Local Bank, in addition to the Ministry of Finance sending personnel to check the cash reserves on the 4th of this month, as for the issuance of banknotes, because the bank is provincial in nature, it is reported that the Ministry of Finance has issued separate orders for handling, so it is not included in the three banks' takeover list.</p>
<p>Clearing Methods, Slight Changes</p>
<p>According to past practice, banks had to send each other the banknotes of other banks they received every evening. Since the 4th of this month, the banknotes of other banks received by the Central, China, and Communications Banks have not been returned separately, but have been replaced by legal tender for circulation. The other nine banks, such as Bank A, do not need to exchange all the banknotes of Banks B and C, but can hand them over to the three banks for clearing or add them to their interbank savings accounts. (Note: The clearing of the Banking Industry Preparedness Committee's clearing house every evening involves various bills, which are not related to banknotes.)</p>

<h3>Shangchuan Transportation Company Extends Chuannan Railway - Survey Completed, Track Laying Begins - Expected to Reach Zhujiaqiao This Winter</h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the Shangchuan Transportation Company was initiated and organized by Huang Yanpei, Gu Lanzhou, and others in 1924, with a capital of 400,000 yuan. It has built a light railway from Shanghai to Chuansha, a total length of 21 kilometers. It has been in operation for ten years. The railway has three large locomotives, six small locomotives, and sixteen passenger cars. The entire railway employs a total of 120 people. The annual operating income is about 200,000 yuan. After paying annual interest of 1% or 8-9% and employee salaries, food, office expenses, coal, repairs, etc., there is sometimes a surplus. Starting this year, after a resolution by the shareholders' meeting, a plan was approved to extend the original Shangchuan Line, passing through Nanhui to Daduan Town, a length of 28 kilometers, with a budget of 600,000 yuan. In addition to the board of directors and old shareholders undertaking a portion, the rest will be raised through new shares. Surveying began in March of this year and has been completed. Construction has already begun, and earthwork has been laid to Zhujiaqiao in Nanhui County. 100,000 sleepers and 100 tons of steel rails have been purchased from the United Kingdom and Germany, and are expected to arrive in Shanghai this month, and track laying will begin immediately. It is hoped that a section will be completed this winter and opened to traffic. All locomotives and passenger cars will be temporarily used from the original ones. Once the business develops in the future, carriages will be added and gradually expanded.</p>
<h3>Jinghu Railway and Zhuan Steamboat Bureau Handle Passenger Joint Transport - Revised Contract Term of One Year</h3>
<p>The Jinghu Railway and Zhuan Steamboat Bureau have been handling passenger joint transport for many years. The original contract has expired. A revised standard joint transport contract of fifteen articles was signed last month, with a term of one year. The designated joint transport stations, on the railway side, are Shanghai North, Nanxiang, Kunshan, Suzhou, Wuxi, and other five stations. On the steamboat bureau side, they are Baihegang, Qingpu, and Zhujiage, three ports. Joint transport tickets are valid for the day of issue. For accompanied baggage exceeding the free weight, the railway charges two cents per kilometer per 20 kilograms, while the steamboat bureau charges five cents. The loading and unloading from the station to the steamboat or from the steamboat to the station is handled by the railway bureau's stevedores, charging twelve copper coins per piece, which is shared by both parties in proportion to the total joint transport income from passenger baggage, without additional charges to passengers.</p>
<h3>Health Bureau Implements Compulsory Vaccination Starting Yesterday - Expected to be Assisted by Public Security Bureau Police in One Month</h3>
<p>According to the Daily News, in view of the uneven temperatures in the city after entering winter, which can easily lead to the spread of smallpox, and the only good way to prevent it is to vaccinate with cowpox, the Municipal Health Bureau sent personnel to various primary and secondary schools in the South Shanghai and Zhabei districts starting on the first of last month to administer free cowpox vaccinations. The bureau has also determined that the city's area is vast, the population is complex, and the general working class lacks health knowledge and does not know how to prevent it. Therefore, after consultation with the Public Security Bureau, it was decided that, starting yesterday (the 15th), a large number of health officers will be dispatched to form teams with the police of the Public Security Bureau to go to the city's shack areas to compulsorily administer free vaccinations. In addition, the bureau will dispatch multiple health vehicles to the main roads and administer vaccinations along the way. The date is scheduled for one month, in the hope that all citizens of the city will be able to get vaccinated for prevention in a short period of time, so that smallpox will no longer be possible to occur.</p>

<p>According to the Datong News Agency, the Municipal Zoo on Wenmiao Road began displaying a pair of valuable parrots yesterday. One is red and one is green, not only are the feathers moist and gorgeous, but the red and green contrast is also very interesting.

They are currently on display in the Water Pavilion for public viewing. It is reported that the parrots belong to Ding Xingtai Wuhang of the City Temple, and the display time in the park is set for three months.</p>
<h3>Thieves Active in Nanshi - Taking Advantage of the Police Adjustment - Gang of Thieves Organized to Steal</h3>
<p>Recently, shops and stores in the Nanshi area have been frequently broken into and robbed by thieves late at night, causing many victims. It is reported that these thieves have formed a gang, and steal between 2-3 a.m. late at night, taking advantage of people being asleep and the police adjusting posts. The gang also arranges lookouts to watch out and issue secret codes, which is very meticulous. At 3:40 a.m. yesterday morning, when Wang Rugang of the Sixth Gang on Zhonghua Road was taking over his post, he saw three people standing and chatting across from the Sugar Industry Association. The police suspected that they were suspicious because it was late at night, so he stepped forward to question and drive them away. Unexpectedly, these people dared to resist. While arguing, he suddenly saw the iron door of the Lao Tian Cheng Medicine Store wide open and saw two people walking out. The police knew something was wrong, so he abandoned the three people and went to check. However, the gang had cut off the escape route, causing the thieves who came out of the medicine store to flee. The police recognized them and chased after them. Unexpectedly, the two thieves were holding glass bottles and threw them at the police to resist arrest. The police immediately called to neighboring posts for help and chased them to the French Concession outside Xiaodongmen before capturing one person. The items left behind by the gang when they fled, such as felt hats and pants, were taken by the French police to the police station. After interrogation, they were handed over to the Yimiao Police Station for investigation. After interrogation by Director Liu, it was found that the captured Wu A'jin had colluded with the gang to steal and resisted arrest and attempted to escape. In addition to ordering the arrest of the remaining gang members, he was sentenced to be sent to the General Bureau for handling in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Well-Dressed - Students Act as Thieves - Specializing in Stealing from Schools, Numerous Crimes - Impenitent, Sentenced to Two Years in Prison</p>
<p>Xu Wenjun, a young student from Nanjing, was well-dressed and claimed to be a student at a certain university. He specialized in using his thieving skills in the dormitories and gatehouses of schools in the north and south of the city to make a living. He had committed numerous crimes. On September 12 of this year, Xu sneaked into the office of the Qingnian Middle School on Xiafei Road in the French Concession, claiming to visit a friend. Taking advantage of the unpreparedness, he stole a wallet from Chen Yuejiang, a teacher at the school, containing 105 yuan. He fled with the stolen goods. When Chen discovered it, Xu had already gone far away, so he reported it to the French police. The next day, the detective arrested Xu and found a portion of the stolen money. After investigation, Xu admitted that he specialized in stealing clothes from various schools. He was sent to the pawnshop to retrieve several stolen items and sent them to the Second Special Court for interrogation. Xu Wenjun was sentenced to one year and four months in prison. Xu refused to accept the verdict and filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the High Court. While under review, it was also found that Xu had committed a theft in the Chinese area in November of last year, and was sentenced to imprisonment by the District Court, with a suspended sentence. Since Xu committed theft as a regular occupation and was impenitent, the case was transferred to the Nanshi District Court for review. The final trial was announced, and at 4 p.m. the day before yesterday, Sun Honglin, acting presiding judge of the Third Branch of the High Court, along with two judges Wang and Ma, arrived at the Third Criminal Court and ordered the appellant Xu Wenjun to be brought to court. Xu Wenjun was sentenced to ten months in prison for theft, and one year and four months in prison for habitual theft, to be served concurrently for a total of two years. After the prison term is completed, he will be sent to a labor camp for compulsory work for two years. Xu listened to the verdict and was silently taken away by the bailiff and returned to the detention center to await execution.</p>
<h3>Patient Suffers Mental Breakdown - Jumps From Building, Dies From Injuries</h3>
<p>Hu Kewen, a native of Anhui, resided at No. 4 in Hexing Lane, Kangqu Road, South Shanghai, and was 37 years old. He worked as a weaver. He recently contracted typhoid fever and had been ill for over a month. On the 12th of this month, his family sent Hu to Guangci Hospital for diagnosis and treatment. The hospital admitted him to a ward on the fourth floor. At 9 a.m. on the 14th, Hu suddenly suffered a mental breakdown. Taking advantage of the unpreparedness of the nurses, he suddenly jumped up from his bed, went to the window, and jumped down regardless of the consequences. He fell from a height to the ground. When the nurses and waiters discovered it and rushed over, it was too late to rescue him. He died instantly from internal injuries. The hospital reported to the Lukiawan Central Police Station, which transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall mortuary. A detective was dispatched to investigate the circumstances of the deceased's jump and to notify the deceased's brother, Hu Keshun (27 years old), to come to the station. Yesterday, a report was made to the Second Special Court. Prosecutor Wang Ren, along with a forensic doctor and clerk, arrived at the mortuary. It was verified that the deceased had died from injuries sustained from a fall. According to the detective's investigation report, the official questioned the deceased's family and then ruled that the body could be claimed for burial by the deceased's brother, Hu Keshun, after signing a guarantee.</p>
<h3>Over Eighty People Fined for Underpayment of Stamp Duty - From 1.5 to 15 Yuan</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal North-South commercial firms received the new regulations stipulated by the Stamp Tax Bureau on September 1 of this year regarding the amount of stamp tax to be affixed to vouchers, bills, and other documents, some of the firms had slight misunderstandings, resulting in underpayment of stamp tax. The bureau investigated and found out the firms that had underpaid or had insufficient stamps affixed, and ordered judicial police from the Shanghai District Court to summon the shop owners or managers of those firms, numbering more than eighty in total, yesterday (the 15th) at 9 a.m. The judge of the Criminal Court took the seat in the Ninth Court and questioned each of them about their age, origin, and underpayment of stamp duty, and imposed fines on them separately. The largest fine was 15 yuan per person, and the smallest was 1.5 yuan. Each summoned person paid the fine, signed a guarantee, and was instructed not to underpay again in the future. All the summoned people respectfully retreated.</p>
<h3>Wei Delin Resists With a Knife, Lu A'lin Dies - Tragic Scene in Front of Cigarette Shop</h3>
<p>Wei Delin, a Ningbo native, opened a small cigarette shop at No. 475 Dalianwan Road. At 10:40 p.m. the night before last, he had a dispute with Lu A'lin (22 years old), a native of Tongzhou who worked as a waiter at the Zhengyi Society Hospital at No. 459 Huade Road, and Sun Dongsheng and more than ten other people over money owed. Wei was outnumbered and took out a small foreign knife to resist. As a result, both Lu and Sun were injured in the body. They were taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Lu's knife wound was in a vital part of the side and he soon died. The Huishan Police Station sent Chinese detective Sun Aizhong to investigate. The body was taken to the Feilun Road mortuary to await examination, and Wei Delin surrendered to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. After questioning by Judge Xiao Xiefen, he was ordered to be remanded in custody for further investigation. The court sent Prosecutor Guo Wei to the mortuary to examine Lu's body. It was determined that the deceased Lu A'lin had died from knife wounds inflicted during his lifetime. The suspect Wei Delin should be prosecuted by the police. The body was handed over to the Pushan Villa for burial.</p>
<h3>Qinmei Brothel - Who is the Procuress? - Prostitutes' Statements Contradict - Younger Sister Loses Virginity, Difficult to Marry - Yang Baosheng Charged Case Concludes</h3>
<p>Qinmei Old Nine, a prostitute at Qinmei Brothel No. 5 Fuyu Lane, Beihai Road, whose original name was Song Xiaodi (also known as Huihua, daughter of Song Guisheng of Chuansha, 19 years old), was pawned by her father to the procuress Yang Baosheng (also known as Yang Shengji) of the brothel in 1932 for 500 yuan. Ostensibly, she was a fostered daughter, but in reality, she was a prostitute. Recently, unable to bear the procuress's abuse, she voluntarily escaped from the brothel and, together with her father Song Guisheng, filed a criminal complaint against Yang Baosheng for harming social customs, requesting legal action and demanding compensation of 3,000 yuan. The case had been gathered once by the First Special District Court, and it was reported in the newspapers. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Jiang Shuzi convened a new trial of both parties. Many prostitutes from the brothel district came to court to listen. The court first questioned the defendant Yang Xiansheng, but the procuress denied that the Qinmei Brothel was opened by her. She said that the owner of the brothel was Zhou Lao San, and Song Xiaodi was a fostered daughter. Although Song Guisheng had repeatedly asked to send Xiaodi to the brothel to work as a prostitute, because Xiaodi's voice was not wide enough and she could not learn songs, she was never allowed to engage in prostitution. Zhou Lao San once borrowed 1,000 yuan from her, and she occasionally ordered Xiaodi to go to the brothel to collect money, but never for prostitution. The court then questioned Zhou Lao San, who admitted that he was the owner of the brothel at No. 5 Fuyu Lane. When asked about the brothel's name, he was initially at a loss. After thinking for a while, he claimed that it was Qinmei, and said that there was only one prostitute in the brothel named Liu Bao, and Xiaodi was not among them. The court then summoned Liu Bao, who testified that she worked as a prostitute at No. 5, and Xiaodi only came to collect interest occasionally. According to the plaintiff Song Xiaodi's testimony, she had been forced by the defendant to work as a prostitute for more than three years, under the name Qinmei Old Nine. At that time, the plaintiff's representative lawyer presented a small newspaper, saying that the flower selection news had a photo of Xiaodi. If she was not a prostitute, she would not be listed in the flower selection. In addition to Xiaodi and Liu Bao, the No. 5 brothel also had Lao Er, Lao San, Didi, and Er Yuanyuan, who were currently sitting in the audience and could be summoned for questioning. Unexpectedly, the four prostitutes sitting in the audience, except for Lao Er, who remained motionless, the other three prostitutes unexpectedly left the courtroom. Judge Jiang immediately ordered the court clerks to summon those people back and question them one by one. Lao Er admitted that she worked as a prostitute at No. 5 and said that the brothel was indeed opened by the procuress Yang. Xiaodi's nickname was Qinmei Old Nine, and Liu Bao and others were sisters. Zhou Lao San was not the procuress, and Zhou's statement was false. However, the testimony of the three prostitutes Didi and others differed greatly from that of Xu Lao Er, saying that Yang was not the procuress and Xiaodi was not a prostitute in the brothel. The court then questioned Xiaodi again, who claimed that they were originally the same as her and had to leave the hall on business, but in order to rely on Yang for a living, they had to agree with her and say these insincere words. She was really unbearable to be abused and left the brothel on September 24. According to Song Guisheng's testimony, my daughter was to be a fostered daughter with Yang, and the 500 yuan was a loan from her. At first, he did not know that his daughter was being forced into prostitution after being fostered. Now that my daughter's chastity has been lost, it is difficult for her to marry, which will ruin her life. Therefore, I request that the defendant be punished and order her to compensate for the loss of 3,000 yuan. Finally, after mutual debate by the lawyers of both parties, the court adjourned to be pronounced next Friday afternoon.</p>
<h3>New Gate Detective Squad Cracks Down on Robbery Gang: Eight Suspects, Including Men, Women, and Children, Arrested; One Handgun and Six Bullets Confiscated</h3>
<p>Around 3 PM the day before yesterday, Li Guiqing, the deputy squad leader of the detective squad of the New Gate branch of the Zhabei Public Security Bureau, received a confidential report stating that a robbery gang was hiding in the shantytowns around Pushan Road and had three handguns. Deputy Squad Leader Li immediately reported this to the head and deputy head of the branch, Bao Ziying and Shi Zuhan. They dispatched Squad Leader Liu Changpei, along with detectives Sun Youzhi and Zang Nai, to cooperate with Police Officer Li Chaofeng from Post No. 41 of the Sun Temple Police Station and proceed to the address. They arrested Wu Jinqiao (also known as Xiao Wuzi). After being taken to the station, Wu Jinqiao confessed that he was 26 years old, from Yancheng, and that his accomplices were living at No. 48 at the end of Datong Road, No. 457 at No. 4 Bridge on Zhongshan Road, and in the shantytowns. Therefore, that evening, the squad dispatched additional detectives Mao Gongzhao, Cai Jilin, Liu Bingrong, Zhou Deming, Zhang Shuwen, Gao Changgui, Yang Yucai, and the original investigator Li Guiqing to different locations. They successfully apprehended Lu Changbao, Li Hong (also known as Li San), Xu Er (also known as Xu Xiaoer), Li Sidi (female), Li Wangshi, and two girls. One handgun and six bullets were seized. Yesterday morning, all suspects were brought to the station. During interrogation, Wu Jinqiao (also known as Xiao Wuzi) confessed: "On the 9th of this month, I was playing at Li San's house. Li San told me to take a six-round handgun to get bullets. There was also a six-inch Browning handgun that he told me to hide. The next day (the 10th), Lu Changbao talked to me about robbery. He said he didn't have a handgun, so I gave him the six-round handgun and told him to get bullets. Later, he said he couldn't get any and returned it to me. I went to return it to Li San, but he wasn't home, so I gave it to his niece, Xiao Dizi, and told her to put it away. I don't know where she took it after that. The other handgun is hidden in the Pushan Road shantytown. We robbed the Yongxing Rice Store at No. 4 Bridge on Zhongshan Road once, and nothing else." Lu Changbao confessed: "I am 21 years old, from Suqian, and live at No. 457, No. 4 Bridge on Zhongshan Road." His confession was similar to Xiao Wuzi's. Li Hong (also known as Li San) stated: "I am 28 years old, from Funing, and live in the shantytowns at the end of Datong Road." His confession was evasive. Li Sidi confessed: "I am 14 years old, from Funing. A few days ago, Xiao Wuzi brought a handgun and told me to put it away. I put it under my pillow. The next day, around 1 PM, Third Grandfather (referring to Li San) came to get the handgun from me. I told him it was under the pillow, and he took it. He didn't come back that night." Xu Er (also known as Xu Xiaoer) confessed: "I am 35 years old." His confession was the same as Li Sidi's. Li Wangshi confessed: "I am 32 years old, from Funing, and live behind the Shuntai Cotton Mill at No. 4 Bridge West on Zhongshan Road. A few days ago, Li San brought a handgun and asked me to repair it for him. He said he was now a detective in the Sixth District Public Security Bureau and that it was okay."</p>

<p>On the afternoon of August 3rd of this year, when the Shengjing steamship was raising anchor to depart from the Taikoo Wharf No. 3 in the French Concession, the propeller's movement brought up the naked lower body of a strange female corpse, Zhang Jinlin, from the river. The corpse's aunt, Zhang Zhoushi, identified the body and arranged for a coffin. The case caused a sensation in society at the time. Subsequently, the Procuratorate of the District Court arrested Qiao Qishi, a female major suspect in the case. Prosecutor Xie Lian interrogated her, and she was prosecuted in the Criminal Division on the charge of joint murder. Judge Wu Xiangzu conducted two trials, details of which have been reported in previous newspapers. Judge Wu believed that the case involved significant discrepancies. The defendant, Qiao Qishi, vehemently protested her innocence and denied being present at the scene, while the testimony of the witness, Hao Zhongyang, was detailed and seemed unlikely to be fabricated. Believing that a thorough on-site investigation was necessary to clarify the truth and avoid any injustice, the judge scheduled a personal on-site inspection. Yesterday morning at 10 AM, Judge Wu Xiangzu, along with Clerk Fan Shengyang, and defense attorney Fang Junjie, accompanied witness Hao Zhongyang and traveled by car to Taikoo Wharf No. 3 for an on-site investigation. This reporter, wishing to understand the actual situation at the time, also drove to the scene. Judge Wu disembarked upon arrival and first carefully observed the area around the wharf. (Note: Wharf No. 3 has two floating bridges, north and south, connected to an outer floating pier, with a high wharf in the middle, usually used to stack bamboo exports.) Then, Hao Zhongyang led them to the northern floating bridge and pointed out that around 10 PM that night, a yellow car came from the north and stopped here (at the base of the northern floating bridge). The two men, three women, and one girl who got out of the car walked from the southern floating bridge to the floating pier and boarded the Shengjing steamship to play for a while. Then they returned to the southern end of the floating pier, spread newspaper on the springboard placed on the pier, sat down, and ate watermelon seeds while chatting. At that time, I was on the high wharf, gambling at pai gow with eight or nine companions. We saw them chatting and laughing happily, and my companions clapped their hands and joined in. Later, I suddenly saw a man take off a woman's pants. I thought they were messing around. Thinking that seeing this would bring bad luck, I went to sleep on the refrigerator on the floating bridge pier. Suddenly, I heard a child scream for help and the sound of water in the river. I immediately got up and rushed to the southern end of the floating pier to see what was happening (note: the refrigerator is about fifty steps from the southern pier side). I planned to grab some bamboo from the pile on the high wharf to try and rescue her, but a man glared at me and knocked me down." The judge asked how old the girl was and what time it was. Hao replied that the girl was about six or seven years old, and the time was one and three-quarters past one o'clock on the New Customs clock. He also pointed out that Qiao Qishi was standing on the southern end of the pier, facing the southern floating bridge (note: the Shengjing steamship happened to have arrived yesterday and was docked there). According to Hao, the deceased fell into the river near the side of the southern end of the floating pier, not the outer barrier. Hao Zhongyang recounted the events in vivid detail, and Clerk Fan Shengyang drew a diagram. The judge then dismissed Hao Zhongyang and instructed him to await further summons. They then returned to the court by car.</p>

<h3>Second Horticultural Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Second Horticultural Exhibition, sponsored by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, officially opened yesterday at the Donggou Municipal Botanical Garden in Pudong. Despite the wind and rain, it was still very crowded with visitors. At the entrance of the venue, there was a memorial archway made of pine and cypress, inscribed with a horizontal plaque that says: "Shanghai Second Horticultural Exhibition," with a couplet on the side that reads: "Beauty and wealth gathered in the botanical garden, collecting a variety of fragrances in one record; dignified display of art and planting, happily integrate the letters of summer to inspire sprout culture." The aisle inside the gate was wide, planted with Chinese arborvitae on both sides, interspersed with various flowers. In the midst of greenery, red and purple blossoms were vibrant and dazzling, creating a refreshing atmosphere. To the west, there was a shaded canopy, with hundreds of varieties of famous chrysanthemums from the botanical garden in the center, and a greenhouse, with exotic goldfish from the Golden Fish Paradise, Angora wool rabbits from the Minsheng Chicken Farm, and Lida ducks from the Chicken Farm, all rarely seen in Shanghai. Behind the greenhouse, there was a small stream. Walking north along the stream, one reached the second gate of the venue, next to a couplet that reads, "Bamboo rhymes with maple red, vegetables and fruits compete for beauty, mountains surround water, pine and cypress are evergreen." Inside the second gate, there were rolling hills, with magnificent upright chrysanthemums arranged at the foot of the hills, which was particularly spectacular. In the center of the venue, there was a thatched cottage, titled "Abundance," with a couplet that reads, "Objects compete for novelty, scarlet, yellow, red and purple, flowers and fruits are abundant, tree art and botanical garden." The beams and pillars in the hall were all painted with vermilion lacquer, which, together with various horticultural flowers, created an interesting effect. The exhibits were arranged in a circular pattern, and the exhibits included fruit trees, vegetables, local goods, fruits, etc., which were extremely exquisite. Fragrant flowers swirled and fallen petals fluttered about, making the scene nothing short of an earthly paradise. As of yesterday morning, there were more than sixty exhibitors, including the Native Produce Trade Association, the Fruit Trade Association, Canadian Greenhouse Planting Farm, Dongda Farm, Dahua Farm, Shisen Farm, Guanshengyuan, China Chemical Industry, Huang's Livestock Planting Farm, Xiangshun Garden, Gu Lanji, and Zhiyulu.

<h3>Silk and Satin Dyeing Industry Discusses Dyeing Prices Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silk and Satin Dyeing Industry Association convened a meeting yesterday to reorganize dyeing prices. More than 80 people attended, including representatives from Lao Zhenghe, Lu Tingjian, Qian Da Hu, Wei Ren, Lao Zhenchang, Guo Fengshan, and Shun Da Chang, Zhang Xicheng. Tan Borong chaired the meeting, and Wang Shipeng took the minutes. The chairman first gave a report, stating that since the Italy-Abyssinia War, the cost of goods shipped to China from various countries has skyrocketed due to the sharp increase in exchange rates, and the prices of imported goods in China have gradually soared. Just looking at the item of dyes, prices have recently risen and there is a shortage of goods. Dyes are necessities for our industry. Since dyes are gradually rising in price, the impact on costs is enormous. The dyeing prices in our industry are still difficult to maintain even with hard work. If dyes rise sharply this time, and we do not actively reorganize and agree on uniform prices, how can we make up for the losses? Recently, the silk industries in Shanghai and Hangzhou have successively published price increases in various newspapers. The woolen, knitting, dyeing, and weaving industries have all reported price increases. The dye industry has also simultaneously advertised that it sells for cash. Recently, the government has implemented the legal tender policy, and the market economy has changed. Now, the Municipal Government has issued instructions to various industries to set appropriate prices within a limited time and submit the proposed price list to the bureau for record-keeping. There are already supervisory measures for the implementation of uniform prices. If our industry loses this opportunity to discuss prices and determine the restrictions on the amount of fabric and size, the industry will be even more unsustainable. Please work together to save the industry. Discussion of important issues: (1) Regarding the reorganization of dyeing prices, we should first formulate an increase standard for implementation. (Resolution) Appoint specialists to formulate a reorganization plan and an increase standard, and then submit it to the general assembly for discussion and approval. (2) Restrict the amount of silk fabric and size submitted for dyeing to suit the work. (Resolution) This case will be handled after careful discussion and progress. (3) Regarding whether to change the "monthly fee standard" decided at the last meeting. (Resolution) The standard for monthly fees decided last time should be changed immediately to "one cent will be collected from the industry for every piece of silk dyed in a month" as the monthly fee. At the end of each month, the association will send personnel to check the number of dyed fabrics registered in the dyed fabric book and calculate the amount to be paid. The above-mentioned fee collection standard is more universal, equal, and fair than the previous method. (4) This association should send personnel to persuade people to join the association. (Resolution) Agreed to do so. (5) Adjournment.</p>

Later, he established the Japanese Examination Association, translating various political, economic, and diplomatic books that meet the needs of the times, which became popular. He is currently working as a counselor for the Chairman's Office of the Military Affairs Commission, the head of the Design Committee's Translation Department, and a research secretary. Mr. Fu has a noble view of life, is rigorous in his words and deeds, strict with himself, and has a forthright disposition. He is very selective in choosing a partner and would rather remain single unless he finds someone with a similar spirit of the New Life Movement. Therefore, he is only now marrying Ms. 羅梅淸 (Luó Méiqīng). Ms. Luo comes from a prominent family in Panyu. Her father, Mr. 羅維翰 (Luó Wéihàn), served as an official in the two lakes (Hunan and Hubei) during the late Qing Dynasty and was known for his political achievements. Since the Republic of China, he has founded industries such as the Hankou Jiji Hydroelectric Company and the Daxing Textile Factory, and organized literary and art societies to study ancient and modern art, under the pseudonym 四峯 (Sìfēng). Ms. Meiqing was taught by her father early on and graduated from the middle school of the Hankou Western Overseas School. She is proficient in both new and old knowledge and has mastered both Chinese and Western skills in managing household affairs. She and Mr. Fu are both practitioners of the New Life Movement. Now that they are forming a new family, they will surely be a model for society. They are scheduled to marry at 4 p.m. today (the 16th) at the New World Restaurant on Nanjing Road, with Mr. 褚慧僧 (Chǔ Huìsēng) as the officiant. It is sure to be a lively occasion.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>Regarding a matter of correction, your newspaper on the 6th of this month, i.e., the third page, eleventh edition of issue number 22461, stated that the Soviet Russian government, in view of the large number of overseas Chinese in this city and the inconvenience in treating diseases, has specially built a large-scale hospital on a vacant lot at the corner of Pershing Road in the French Concession to provide relief to poor and sick Russian overseas Chinese, and that a religious ceremony was held for the groundbreaking on the afternoon of the day before yesterday (the 3rd).</p>
<p>Upon investigation, this hospital was planned and founded by the Shanghai Eastern Orthodox Association of White Russian overseas Chinese in Shanghai ten years ago (1923). Now, it is expanding and seeking a new site for reconstruction. The matter has nothing to do with the Soviet Russian government. The information published by your newspaper is inconsistent with the facts. I hereby write to request that your editor-in-chief correct the information in the short term to clarify the facts.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Meitzer, President of the Shanghai White Russian Overseas Chinese Association</p>

<h3>The Path of Political System Reform (Continued)</h3>
<p>—潘公展 (Pān Gōngzhǎn) (November 1935, Shanghai)</p>
<p>——Respectfully dedicated to the comrades of the Fifth National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang and the gentlemen who discuss political system reform——</p>
<p>(1) Political system reform must be based on historical experience and national habits. Hugh Sellon, the author of Democracy and Dictatorship, once said: "Germany's past history makes it unsuitable for parliamentary politics... The Germanic nation has a kind of emotional fondness for autocratic regimes, and politically, it is the most docile and easily agitated nation in Europe; these characteristics make it unsuitable for democratic politics, and strong rulers become necessary leaders... Therefore, the failure of Western democratic rule in Germany best proves the folly of completely transplanting foreign methods to another country." He also solemnly pointed out: "The political liberation of each country occurs in its own soil, its own national character, and the experiences accumulated by its own history." Now, some "scholars" who advocate "complete Westernization" wish they could transplant the British constitutional system, which has been experienced for 1,400 years, to China overnight. One says that "one-party" dictatorship is not in line with democracy, and "party rule" must be abolished. Another says that "constitutionalism is the best training for constitutionalism" and that "political tutelage" can be concluded. However, they do not know that the flavor of party struggle under "parliamentary politics" has been tasted for more than ten years in the historical experience since the Republic of China, and the habits of the Chinese people, "those who soothe me are my lords, and those who abuse me are my enemies," and "I go out at sunrise and rest at sunset; what has the emperor's power to do with me!" have been unbreakable for thousands of years. Therefore, if we want to guide the Chinese people into the path of democratic political system, we must rely on wise leaders and the founding party to protect them. In other words, the political system can be reformed, and the constitution can be promulgated, but we must not take the old path of British and American-style multi-party strife-ridden "parliamentary politics" again, so as not to fall into a political tide of overlapping waves and exhaustion.</p>
<p>(2) Political system reform must be based on the legacy of the Premier and the needs of the times. The Republic of China was founded by the Premier himself, the Outline of National Construction was formulated by the Premier himself, the Three Principles of the People are the doctrine of national construction, and the Five-Power Constitution is the mechanism of national construction. All of these are the legacy of the Premier. Whether it is from military administration to political tutelage, or from political tutelage to constitutionalism, it is permissible to increase or decrease them according to the needs of the times, but it is not permissible to fundamentally disregard them to cater to popular customs. Since the members of the Kuomintang are loyal believers of the Premier, they should be of one mind and one heart and carry it through to the end. Therefore, opposing the Three Principles of the People—if you use revolutionary means to overthrow the Kuomintang, and then discard all the Premier's legacy and ignore it, then the situation is still forgivable; if the believers of the Three Principles of the People are anesthetized by the theory of political system reform, without carefully considering how to reform the political system, and take reckless actions, embarking on the path of abandoning the Premier's legacy, then the blame is unforgivable. "Since ancient times, everyone has died, but the people cannot stand without trust." In the current difficult situation, the Kuomintang, in addition to恪奉 (kèfèng) respectfully following the Premier's legacy, taking the "world as one" as its heart, and bearing the responsibility of "bearing hardship and resentment," to show the world its great trust, has no other way to seek understanding from the people of the country, nor any other path to save its country. As for the needs of the times, all those who have studied political systems know that the strengthening of administrative power is indeed a consistent trend in various countries recently, and it is especially in line with the current environment in our country. Because in extraordinary times, dealing with national affairs requires prudence and decisiveness, both of which are indispensable. If we still hold the outdated concept of preventing the dictatorship of administrative leaders in the 18th and 19th centuries, and blindly want to raise legislative power to restrain administrative power, or even make it surpass administrative power, so that even if the administrative leader has talent and the administrative organization is flexible, it is impossible to show the omnipotence of its government, then in the process of internal peace and foreign resistance, national salvation and survival, the country will inevitably suffer invisible losses. Therefore, within the scope of following the Premier's legacy, according to the trends of the times, strengthening the power of the administrative mechanism is 100% necessary. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Wusong Zhoujiabridge - Murder for Money Occurs, Silver Necklace Exchanged for $3.60, Murderer Ma Jinshan Arrested on the Same Day</p>
<p>In a straw shed in Zhoujiabridge, west of Wusong Town, there was a woman from Jiangbei Taizhou, Zhou Chou, who was over 40 years old and worked as a female worker in a yarn factory to make a living. She had a son and a daughter. Her son, Guilin, 8 years old, was playing alone in the nearby fields on the morning of the 14th. A neighbor and fellow villager, Ma Jinshan, 17 years old, caught sight of Guilin playing alone and noticed that he was wearing a silver necklace around his neck. Immediately, he became greedy and went forward to snatch it. Although Guilin was young, he refused to let go, causing Ma Jinshan to strangle the child to death with a cloth belt and abandon the body in a swamp beach. Ma then took the stolen silver necklace to the Laobaocheng Silver Shop on Songxing Road and exchanged it for $3.60 in cash for use. It was not until around 4 p.m. that the child's body was discovered by a villager cutting grass. At that time, the child's mother, Zhou Chou, was searching for her son. Upon hearing the news and going to identify the body, she confirmed that it was her son Guilin's body, which was still warm. There was a cloth belt around his neck, and a silver necklace was missing. Knowing that he had been murdered for money, she could not help but cry bitterly. The matter was learned by Bao Guanwu, a detective from the Wusong Police Station, who went to the scene of the incident to investigate the situation. He then went to various silver shops to inquire and found the original stolen goods in Laobaosheng. After questioning the appearance and clothing of the murderer, he immediately cooperated with the police to arrest the murderer Ma Jinshan. The suspect confessed without denying it. Chief Deng Zhiyi, as the matter concerned murder for money, yesterday morning ordered the local guarantor Zhou Lansheng to submit the case to the Shanghai District Court to send personnel to Wusong for inspection in order to punish the crime.</p>

<h3>Huacheng Workers' Children School Held its Seventh Anniversary Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Huacheng Cigarette Factory Workers' Children School on Huishan Road in this city has been established for seven years. Principal Chen Peiming has spared no effort in developing school affairs. Therefore, the school has made significant progress every year. The number of students suddenly increased to more than 400 this summer. The original school buildings were not enough. Therefore, the school board members Gu Shaoqing, Zhou Xuexiang, etc., raised funds to add a new school building, which has also been completed. November 15th this month was the seventh anniversary of the school's establishment. At 9:00 AM, the school specially gathered all teachers and students, as well as representatives of students from the literacy school and the worker's supplementary night school, a total of more than 500 people, to hold a celebration meeting in the school's auditorium. Chen Heqin, director of the Chinese Education Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Yao Zantang, representative of the director of the Municipal Bureau of Education, Pan Gongzhan, and many others, including Yu Zuoting, Yuan Deng, and school board members Gu Shaoqing and Zhou Xuexiang, all gave sincere speeches. In the afternoon, the school's students gave physical and musical performances, and the grand occasion was unprecedented.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Bureau of Education Bans Xinhua Elementary School</h3>

<h3>Seventh International Gongzhan Cup Handball Tournament</h3>
<p>First Cycle Scheduled to Begin on the 25th of This Month; China is Sharpening its Swords and Guns and Practicing at the West Youth Venue</p>
<p>The 7th Gongzhan Cup National Land Handball Competition is scheduled to be held on the 25th of this month at the YMCA on Jing'an Temple Road. The Chinese team, which has won two consecutive championships in recent years, has agreed with the West Youth to practice at the West Youth ball room for nine days starting next Monday (18th) in order to strive for excellence and familiarize themselves with the venue. Veteran players Zhu Kuan and Sun Daosheng will once again dominate the field and maintain the honor for our Chinese team. Cup Competition History Handball is still in its infancy in our country and has not attracted as much attention as other ball games. The Shanghai YMCA has been working hard to promote it for several decades, and the atmosphere is booming. It has cultivated many outstanding talents. In the winter of the 21st year of the Republic of China, Pan Gongzhan, director of the Municipal Bureau of Education, advocated for further promotion and obtained the consent of the West Youth Association of the West Youth in this port to initiate the international handball competition, which began on December 15th of that year for the first competition. Since then, it has been held twice a year in spring and autumn, and Mr. Pan donated a large silver cup, with the name of the championship team engraved on it for each session, and kept it for one season to commemorate it. The competition was named the Gongzhan Cup International Handball Competition. This season is already the seventh session. The first four sessions were all won by the West Youth. Until the fifth and sixth sessions, the Chinese team won the championship with a neat lineup.</p>
<p>This Year's Date The date for this year's competition has been decided by the committee the night before last. The first cycle will be held on the 25th, 26th, and 27th of this month, and the second cycle will be held on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th of next month. If the scores are equal, a third cycle will be held to determine the final. The venue will be the YMCA on Jing'an Temple Road. The competition will be divided into ten singles groups and five doubles groups. A three-game two-win system will be adopted. The winner of each singles or doubles will score one point, and the team with the most points will win. The balls used in the competition will be Spooler 101. Both the Chinese and Western teams have made considerable preparations for this year's competition, and there will be wonderful performances.</p>
<p>Player List In order to reorganize the army, the Chinese team has agreed with the West Youth Association to practice at the association's ball room for five days to familiarize themselves with the venue (from the 18th to the 22nd). The time is from 8:15 PM every night. The following pre-selected personnel must arrive at the venue for practice on time. The list is as follows: Zhu Kuan, Sun Daosheng, Hong Yukui, Cheng Zhenhua, Yu Guanghan, Yan Zhaorong, Hong Rulin, Huang Kesu, Hua Fenggang, Yan Peiqiu, Cai Tongsou, Sun Baoqi, Ding Bingyao, Gao Zishou, Lu Mengsheng, Ma Xinyuan, Sun Jialu, Qu Zhenhu.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Fourth Middle School Joint Games Postponed</h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau Officially Announced Yesterday</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Education issued an instruction to the middle schools in this city yesterday, stating, "The Fourth Joint Games of Secondary Schools in this city were originally scheduled to be held in the autumn of this year. Later, it was discussed that the Sixth National Games would also be held in the autumn. This city is extremely busy preparing for the National Games and organizing participation in various tasks. By the time the closing ceremony ended, it was already late autumn, and the weather was suddenly cold. It is not suitable for students to exercise due to their physical strength and health. In addition, some of the athletes representing this city who participated in the National Games were selected from private secondary schools in this city and already had the opportunity to compete. Holding sports again during the same period will cause fatigue for the students' minds and bodies. Moreover, some schools in this city have suspended classes for one or two days or two or three days to visit the National Games. If the Joint Games of Secondary Schools are held, each school must suspend classes again to visit, which will affect students' studies. This year's Joint Games of Secondary Schools will be better to give students a chance to rest than to hold them in a hurry without any benefit. It has been decided to postpone the event to the spring of next year when the weather is warmer and hold it later. In addition to reporting the reasons for the postponement to the municipal government for record, it is hereby ordered for your information.</p>

<p>Children's Educational Novel</p>
<h3>Little Men (96)</h3>
<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>"No, I've kept them. I thought these must be some treasures of yours that you've carefully preserved," said Mrs. Shu, handing him an old straw hat filled with butterflies and beetles, a handkerchief wrapping a large pile of oddities picked up along the way: a few bird nests, carefully wrapped with moss; strange shells and pebbles; several pieces of fungus; and a few small crabs, in a state of great anger because they were imprisoned.</p>
<p>"Can I have some equipment to put these guys in? Mr. Harder and I found them, they are first-rate characters, so I want to keep them for observation; may I?" Don asked, forgetting his foot, finding it funny to see the crabs scuttling across the bed.</p>
<p>"Of course, you can; Bo Li's old cage is just right. I'll go get it, and be careful not to let them pinch Tandy's toes," Mrs. Shu said as she left. Meanwhile, Don was overjoyed that his treasures had not been discarded as dirty rubbish.</p>
<p>Soon, Ned, Little Bridge, and the cage came together. The crabs moved into this new home, and the children were ecstatic. They showed no fear when they were put into the room. Don recounted the capture of them in much more detail for these admiring listeners. Then he unfolded the package and explained each item. By this time, Mrs. Shu had retreated to a neighboring room so that they could chat freely, but she was surprised and amused by the children's naive conversations.</p>

<h3>Methods of Ultra-Shortwave Oscillation</h3>
<p>— Chongling</p>
<p>Even today, ultra-shortwave radio, although still in the experimental stage, is progressing rapidly, which is quite amazing. It is expected that with the efforts of general experts in the future, ultra-shortwave radio will be able to keep pace with shortwave radio and find new uses. This article describes three methods of ultra-shortwave oscillation that have been successfully tested and introduces them here for the assistance of those who are initially studying ultra-shortwaves.</p>
<p>The oscillation method of ordinary oscillating tubes cannot be applied to generate ultra-short waves with extremely high frequencies due to the limitations imposed by the Goudie rate. The new method was initially successful due to the efforts of experts, including three types: (1) Barkhausen oscillation, (2) Magnetron oscillation, and (3) Diode electron oscillation. They are described separately below.</p>
<p>(1) Barkhausen Oscillation: The Barkhausen oscillator was invented by Mr. Barkhausen and uses a positive grid and negative plate triode (as shown in the figure). A positive pressure of 100 to 200 volts is applied to the grid of the triode, and the plate is connected to a negative pressure of several volts to cause electronic oscillation inside the triode. Therefore, Barkhausen oscillation can also be called triode electronic oscillation. The reason for the occurrence of electronic oscillation can be simply explained as follows: The filament in the tube emits electrons due to heat. Because the grid, which is quite close to the filament, has a positive pressure, there are almost no electrons in the space between the grid and the filament. Therefore, the electrons emitted by the filament have extremely high speeds and are immediately absorbed by the grid. A part of the electrons passing through the grid gap are rejected by the negative pressure of the plate and return. When they reach the vicinity of the filament, they are absorbed by the grid again, rush out of the grid gap, and are turned back by the negative plate. This cycle continues, resulting in oscillation, which is called electronic oscillation. The oscillation frequency depends on the speed of the electrons passing through the grid, so it is related to both the positive grid pressure and the negative plate pressure. If the grid pressure reaches 100 to 200 volts, ultra-short wave oscillation of 30 cm to several meters can be generated. However, the generated power is extremely small and the efficiency is also quite low. The two lines ab shown in the figure are two parallel copper tubes, which are the oscillating circuit for ultra-short wave output, and LL are two high-frequency choke coils.</p>
<p>(2) Magnetic Field Controlled Tube Oscillation: The magnetic field controlled tube is a type of diode. Its plate is cylindrical, and its filament is a line installed in the cylindrical shaft position inside the cylinder. The outside of the tube is surrounded by a current-carrying coil, so that the direction of its magnetic field is parallel to the filament. In order to avoid eddy current loss caused by the magnetic field on the circular screen, the screen is often divided into two parts, making it two semi-cylinders, each connected to a positive pressure, as shown in Figure 11. The role of the magnetic field is to control the movement of electrons inside the tube. When there is no magnetic field, the electrons in the tube, like ordinary diodes, are emitted from the filament and reach the plate directly along the radius, as shown in a in the figure. When there is a magnetic field, the force between the magnetic field and the electron movement occurs (the direction of the force is perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field and the direction of electron movement), causing the electrons to reach the plate along a curved line, as shown in b. If the magnetic field is increased to a certain level, the electrons can move in a circle and fold back to the filament without reaching the plate, as shown in C. Under this C situation, electron oscillation occurs. Therefore, according to the device in Figure 3, if the filament current and plate voltage are properly matched, increasing the strength of the magnetic field (that is, increasing the current in the line diagram F) until the plate current is zero, ultra-short wave oscillation will occur, and will be output by the tuned circuit of two parallel copper tubes TT.</p>
<p>(3) Diode Electronic Oscillation: The third type of oscillation does not use a grid or a magnetic field. The electronic oscillation is entirely undertaken by a specially constructed diode. The structure of this diode is different from the ordinary ones. The filament is cylindrical and the plate is a line, installed in the center of the circle, which is exactly the opposite of the diode described above. The electrons emitted by the filament have speeds that do not go along the radius, causing the electrons to rotate around the plate axis and causing some electrons to escape the attraction of the plate and move back and forth, causing electronic oscillation. Englishman McPetrie recently specially made a diode to do this experiment. The equipment is shown in Figure 4: The plate in the tube is a tungsten line with a diameter of about one millimeter. The filament is also made of tungsten, consisting of four tungsten wires wound on a circle with a radius of about 12.5 millimeters with the plate as the axis and connected in parallel. A and B are two parallel long copper tubes, installed between the plate and the filament. D is a circular copper plate with a diameter of about 30 centimeters, passing through the two lines AB, for changing the wavelength and replacing the choke coil. C is a variable capacitor of about 110 MMF, which is also used to change the frequency. According to the results of his experiment, when the plate voltage is increased to about 360 volts, an ultra-short wave of one and a half meters can be generated, and the generated oscillation frequency is very stable. Sliding the circular copper plate D, or changing the capacitor C, the generated frequency can be arbitrarily changed within the range. When D is pulled closer to the vacuum tube, the frequency increases accordingly. However, D cannot be too close to the vacuum tube. If it exceeds a certain point, the oscillation will stop unless D is still pulled back and then gradually pulled closer, the oscillation cannot be restored.</p>
<h3>Recent European and American Television</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>"Television" is a successor to "Wireless Radio." Although it cannot yet be described as "developed," its future prospects are considerable. In short, it is a period when research is most needed in reality.</p>
<p>Television broadcasting was conducted in England and the United States several years ago, but because the results were not satisfactory, the United States stopped it last year. Although England still continues to broadcast, it has in fact become the "end of the crossbow"! According to the current television broadcasting in the UK, it is only carried out by the British Broadcasting Corporation. The images used for broadcasting are very simple, only 30 lines, which are blurry and unclear, and it is not surprising that they are difficult to satisfy.</p>
<p>Television is different from ordinary wireless radio. With ordinary wireless radio, even a simple receiver such as a mineral radio can achieve considerable results; but television is the opposite. Unless both the broadcasting machine and the receiving machine are very complete, it is not easy to obtain good results.</p>
<p>In the wireless radio industry, the research on television seems to have suffered a setback on the surface, but in fact, European and American countries are competing in research, especially the United States and Germany.</p>
<p>The most significant achievements in the improvement and research of television have been made by R.C.A. Victor Company in the United States, and the Ministry of Communications and Siemens in Germany. Currently, the images broadcast by R.C.A. Victor Company in the United States have been improved from 120 lines to 240 lines, so the images projected are quite clear, like watching a movie. It is heard that they plan to further improve to 360 lines in the future.</p>
<p>Currently, the research focus of European and American television experts is concentrated on the following points:</p>
<p>1.  In broadcasting machines, there is what is called "film intermediate type." The method is to first photograph the object to be broadcast into a film, and then continuously send out the images on the film by the broadcasting machine. The characteristic of this method is that film is an object, not a person, so the broadcasting can be arbitrarily illuminated with strong light, and the results are more considerable. However, since multiple procedures and media are involved, the image may become blurry.</p>
<p>2.  Receiving machines can be roughly divided into two types: those for home use and those for public use. Public receiving machines also use film as a medium. The method is that the radio waves broadcast by the broadcasting machine are received by the receiving machine, then converted into current, and the images are photographed and printed on the film, and then projected like a movie. After the projection, the film is immersed in warm water to wash off the film on the film, and then coated with a photosensitive film, which can be reused.</p>
<p>The above two methods are currently under continued research.</p>
<p>In short, recent European and American research on television has made great progress. Both technically and mechanically, it is nearing completion. So why is television not yet widespread? The reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>1.  The machinery used for television is extremely complex, unlike the simplicity of ordinary wireless radio. For users, the receiving machines that should be prepared cost at least 300 to 400 US dollars each. This is one reason why it is not easy to popularize.</p>
<p>2.  The radio waves used by television are different from those used by ordinary wireless radio. They are a type of ultra-short wave below eight meters. This type of radio wave is not easy to reach far. According to experimental results, the broadcasting range of each broadcasting station is only 70 miles. Therefore, in order to make it reach various places, it is necessary to invest heavily and build numerous broadcasting stations and relay stations. For example, according to the results of research by R.C.A. Victor Company, in order to make television reach all over the United States, it is necessary to set up more than 80 broadcasting stations. This is another reason why it is not easy to popularize.</p>
<p>3.  Television broadcasting machines are very expensive, far exceeding the cost of wireless radio broadcasting machines, so it is not easy to set up broadcasting organizations in ordinary cities. This is another reason why it is not easy to popularize.</p>
<p>4.  The cost required for television broadcasting is extremely huge, so the cost that users should bear is not a small amount. According to calculations by R.C.A. Victor Company in the United States, the fee that users should pay each year needs to be more than 100 gold (US dollars). In this time of economic panic, is it easy to collect such a huge amount of receiving fees from users? This is another reason why it is not easy to popularize.</p>
<p>In short, recent research on television in European and American countries has made rapid progress, and there is a trend of rapid progress. Technically and mechanically, it is about to reach completion, but it is still far from "practical." The desire to "popularize" is even less optimistic. However, with the determination of the experts to study, success can be expected!</p>
<h3>Supply of Voltage to Each Pole of the Vacuum Tube (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Guan Tingzhen</p>
<p>The resistance of the filament or heating element should also be calculated using Ohm's law when in series: Voltage required Resistance = (Supply Voltage - Vacuum Tube Rated Voltage) / Vacuum Tube Rated Current (Ohms)</p>
<p>If the radio uses one No. 78, one No. 77, one No. 43, and one No. 25z5 connected to a 120-volt power line, then its series resistance is equal to 120 volts (supply voltage) minus 62.6 volts (sum of 2×6.3 volts) divided by 0.3 amps (vacuum tube rated current). The answer is about 191 ohms. The electrical power is 120 volts minus 62.6 volts multiplied by 0.3 amps. The answer is about 17.2 watts. When purchasing, a resistor with a larger wattage should be selected. If the rated currents of the vacuum tubes in series are different, then a resistor must be connected to both ends of the filament of the vacuum tube with the smaller current to allow the excess current to pass through. In this way, the calculation of the series resistance must be based on the vacuum tube with the largest rated current.</p>
<h3>Ultra-Shortwave Communication Machine in the National Games</h3>
<p>— Mingxiang</p>
<p>Ultra-shortwave is a treasure buried in wireless radio, which urgently needs to be excavated. American amateurs have already achieved an amazing communication record of 720 miles. There must be not a few amateur research comrades in our country who are interested in ultra-shortwave, but it is rare to have considerable achievements through experimentation. Recently, at the opening of the 6th National Games, the Central News Agency installed multiple 5-meter ultra-shortwave communication machines in the venue to transmit venue news. It was lightweight, clear, and worked perfectly. This can be called the first practical application of ultra-shortwave in our country. The structure of the machine is extremely simple, both transmitting and receiving. The manufacturing method and experimental results are published in detail in the second issue of the Practical Wireless Radio magazine. Readers can succeed by following the instructions. The cost of the whole machine is also very economical. Including the microphone, earpiece, and battery set, it costs about 40 yuan. This machine is on display in the kitchen of the business department of Zhongyong Wireless Electrical Machinery Factory at No. 77, Laohe Road in this city for comrades to visit.</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Microorganism)</p>
<p>Old birds fly around during the day to catch small insects to feed the newly hatched baby birds, and sleep with them in the nest at night. How loving and tender is that? But as soon as the baby birds have grown their feathers and can fly by themselves, they will disperse and each look for their own small insects to eat, and they no longer need the old birds to feed and protect them! Therefore, if a person still relies on the shade of his parents and cannot stand on his own after becoming an adult, he is simply not as good as birds!</p>
<p>On rainy days, water from the eaves drips onto the hard flagstones. The water clearly does not have much strength, but after a long time, a small hole will be formed on the flagstones. This shows that any difficult thing in the world can be achieved if you spare no effort to do it. As the saying goes, "If you work hard enough, an iron rod can be ground into a needle." How apt is this saying!</p>
<h3>Record of Visiting Mr. Chen Qubing's Public Funeral</h3>
<p>— Daoyi</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Qubing of Wujiang was a member of the Tongmenghui. He followed the Premier in the revolution for many years. He had profound academic knowledge and abundant works. He once organized the South Society and led the literary world. He served as a professor in various universities in Beijing, Hangzhou, Shanghai, and Guangdong successively. He had students all over the country. Unfortunately, on the afternoon of the Mid-Autumn Festival in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, he passed away. His old friend, Mayor Wu Tiecheng and others, held a memorial meeting in Shanghai last spring. Now, Liu Yimo, Liu Yazi, Chen Bulei and other celebrities have launched a public funeral at the foot of Tiger Hill in Suzhou. The ceremony was held on the 10th of this month. The reporter admired Mr. very much and went to visit on that day. I will record the grand occasion roughly.</p>
<p>On the morning of that day, the public funeral was held in the Bao'en Temple of the North Temple Pagoda in Suzhou. Old friends and students gathered from far and near. The presidents of the five academies of the National Government and the Central Party Headquarters sent representatives to pay tribute. The magistrate of Wu County and the authorities of various institutions all attended the grand ceremony in person. Those who came from Shanghai included Liu Yazi, Ma Gongyu, Zhu Shaoping, and many other celebrities. At the foot of Gusu Terrace, there was a constant stream of carriages and horses. The walls of Bao'en Temple were covered with elegiac couplets. The most important ones were: Chiang Kai-shek's couplet: The country is still in great difficulty, thinking of Deng Yu's magical plans, why is heaven not generous, crying for Qiao Xuan with a chicken and wine. Premier Wang Jingwei's couplet: It is difficult for the dragon to be tamed, the old man of the South Society praised Zi Jian, the peng corner is restricted by heaven, the cold rain in Wujiang adds to my sorrow. Member Wu Zhihui's couplet: Building the country bears a strange talent, but I regret not being able to hold the balance to govern the world, the literary world recommends a fierce general, who can sweep the pen and promote Hanwei. The rest are so beautiful that it is difficult to record them all. Miss Chen Mianxiang, the daughter of the gentleman, has a poem describing her sorrow: When will the sound of the osprey destroy the room? I sadly write the vow of the tomb, who made me lightly bury it for three years? I should be an orphan in the nine springs, dare to say that I will wait for the table of Longgang, I still hope that there will be a stele of Taoism in human books, looking back at the road on the bank of Xixian Bridge, the autumn wind and rain are so bleak, Zhonglang's daughter is not ashamed of her family's academic origin. After the public sacrifice was over, the public funeral ceremony was held at the tomb at the west end of the two mountain gates of Tiger Hill at 2 pm. After playing music, offering flowers, and reading the eulogy, all those who attended the funeral paid their respects. The ceremony was extremely grand and solemn. From then on, another scenic spot was added to the foot of Tiger Hill, which will be forever commemorated by future generations.</p>
<h3>Anti-Drug Propaganda and Movies</h3>
<p>— Madman</p>
<p>In the past, the entire Chinese film industry, apart from a few works that could be said to have a little significance, was filled with scarlet atmosphere, licentiousness and enjoyment, anesthetizing many young men and women. Although in a certain environment, we should not be too harsh and should forgive them, it is undeniable that the authors did not have sufficient awareness and understanding.</p>
<p>If it is undeniable that movies are not just pure entertainment, they should be responsible for educating the masses and improving society, then the detective film "Emerald Horse" recently produced by Mingxing Film Company is really worthy of high evaluation. Although this film cannot be said to be a perfect work, it has indeed fulfilled a bit of the responsibility of movies.</p>
<p>Since the opening of the sea ban and the large-scale import of opium, a poisonous mist has permeated our entire nation almost everywhere. From the high-ranking officials and nobles in the big cities to the hawkers and peddlers in the remote villages, everyone was addicted to it. The old, the young, the men, the women, the fields, the property, everything was smoked away, and the future of the entire nation's survival was shaken. Although not long ago, the authorities had made a determination to eradicate drugs, can you say that there is absolutely no existence of drugs under this strict prohibition? The responsibility to help promote anti-drug is indeed a natural duty that the film industry cannot ignore. Mr. Xu Xinfu seized the current theme needed by this era and produced this detective anti-drug "Emerald Horse" with sound. The focus of the entire play is not on how to punish drug addicts, but on the elimination of drug trafficking and drug-making organizations, because this is the factory for creating drugs.</p>
<h3>Goldfish Musings</h3>
<p>— Liang Yu</p>
<p>The Chinese Ornamental Fish Society was organized by fellow goldfish enthusiasts, with the late renowned director Mr. Zheng Zhengqiu, along with Xi Guansheng, Chen Zhushen, Zhu Dake, Xu He, Wu Ji, and myself as the initiators. Initially, we planned to gather for a monthly meal to gradually discuss the society's development. Unexpectedly, Mr. Zhengqiu passed away suddenly, and Brother Wu Ji, a key member, became discouraged. Even the monthly gatherings were suspended. However, Chen, Zhu, Xu, and myself were eager to revive the society and decided not to let the Chinese Ornamental Fish Society's reputation decline.</p>
<p>Pearlscale goldfish are the most prized variety, known for their delicate nature and susceptibility to disease. Among those in Shanghai who raise pearlscale goldfish, based on my observations, the order is as follows: first, Ye Xinfu; second, Shao Fengqi; third, Zhou Songling. However, Mr. Shao has recently been preoccupied with business and unable to devote time to goldfish keeping. He has transferred all his prized specimens to my care, with the condition that I provide him with goldfish eggs next spring in exchange. This is a great honor in my goldfish-raising history.</p>
<p>There are three goldfish farms in Shanghai that have pearlscale goldfish. I would rank them as follows: first, Goldfish Paradise; second, Shanghai Goldfish Garden; third, Lin Society. Beyond these, they are rarely seen.</p>
<p>There is a significant lack of specialized books on goldfish keeping in our country. Xu He, the owner of Shanghai Goldfish Garden, will be publishing a "Goldfish Miscellany," which contains a wealth of information. My own "Fish之道" manuscript is about 5,000 words long, and Brother Wu Ji also has a lengthy manuscript. Additionally, there are translations of Japanese books on goldfish keeping, as well as dozens of copperplate illustrations of various exotic goldfish varieties. When this book is published, every goldfish enthusiast should have a copy. It will undoubtedly provide immense benefit in learning goldfish keeping methods.</p>
<p>The owner of Goldfish Paradise, being wealthy, has acquired a unique collection of famous varieties. After the successful goldfish exhibition held at the Municipal Zoo, the garden gained further acclaim. The Social Affairs Bureau will be holding a horticultural exhibition at Pudong on the 15th, 16th, and 17th of this month and has specifically requested that Goldfish Paradise send goldfish for display. I hear that the owner of the garden has already responded with a letter of agreement.</p>
<h3>Fragrant Incense, Vague Records</h3>
<p>— Original text by Princess Der Ling, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>And so, the old lady sat silently, without uttering a word or making a move, her eyes gazing forward but not focused on anything in particular. Although we knew she was deep in thought, we didn't know what she was thinking about. She never spoke a word, her hands rested motionless on her lap, and her face was tensely set.</p>
<p>But she certainly appeared older, at least ten years older than she had been yesterday or the day before. I couldn't help but feel a sense of pity for her from the bottom of my heart, but I dared not say anything to comfort her! All I saw before me was a very, very old woman sitting on a comfortable yellow satin cushion, but carrying on her two weary old shoulders the heavy burden of national security. How burdened she was! Yet she was not afraid. She knew that she at least had the means to deal with everything at present; what would happen in the future was unknowable, so she couldn't help but worry. But in any case, all the people of China were waiting for her to act, and sooner or later she would have to represent China in expressing an appropriate attitude.</p>
<p>The hands of the clock ticked by, but the Empress Dowager continued to sit silently.</p>
<p>Standing beside her, I couldn't help but ponder along with her: I wondered if the old lady was thinking about wanting to reclaim the portion of her youth that she had suddenly lost today. (457)</p>
<p>Global Curiosities</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspapers</h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>The newspaper industry in Japan can be described as highly developed. Newspapers like Asahi and Mainichi are almost like trusts in the Japanese newspaper world, with branch offices throughout the country. Larger prefectures have an additional page dedicated to local news. As a result, local newspapers lack vitality, which is different from China. Japanese newspapers are published twice a day, morning and evening editions. The morning edition has about sixteen pages, and the evening edition has about four pages. At first, seeing "Today's Total: Twenty Pages" on a Japanese newspaper was quite shocking. Later, I learned that a Japanese page is equivalent to one side of a Chinese newspaper, so twenty pages is actually only five sheets, less than our newspapers. Each newspaper costs about one yuan per month, which is not expensive, so many people subscribe. Moreover, education is widespread in Japan, and people are concerned about national affairs. Old women in their fifties and sixties can tell you who Mussolini and Hitler are. Although I haven't seen rickshaw pullers reading newspapers, it is common to see chauffeurs parked on the side of the road reading newspapers or books.</p>
<p>Foreign telegraph news occupies about one page, and city news and daily commentary also occupy one page. In addition, there are radio, business, family, and literary supplements. The telegrams are not like those in China, which seem to be just a series of news items. They are usually organized by the newspaper. News about China is of great interest to the Japanese and appears almost every day in several items. However, there is no news about the lives and studies of Chinese students in Japan. Local news is similar to that in China, consisting of articles about suicides and robberies, with large headlines using a sketching style to make the news look like a novel. What is more valuable is a commentary and a constant stream of foreign dispatches. Japanese newspapers have more foreign correspondents than Chinese newspapers, and the information they provide is about important facts in each country, rather than focusing on local customs.</p>
<p>I find the most interesting aspects of Japanese newspapers to be the photographs and cartoons. The collection of celebrity photographs collected by the various newspapers is truly mountainous. Whenever there is an important news story, a photo of the main figure is always attached to the corner. And even advertisements can have different styles every day, sometimes with caricatures, which is very interesting. This is a method that Chinese newspapers have not yet adopted. Articles related to geography include simple small maps so that readers can understand them at a glance. Maps of various places in China are often found in Japanese newspapers. There are even more photos in local news, with newspapers hiring photojournalists who go out in cars and planes to gather them. Radio, economic news, and film news are similar to those in China, but sometimes there are a few theoretical works that are also very valuable.</p>
<p>Literary works occupy only half a page and are mainly theoretical and lyrical. Their aim is to introduce Western culture and promote Japanese literature. The family supplement is for women and children and is more popular and interesting. Most newspapers have a "Consultation Center," which is a reader's mailbox where readers can submit questions anonymously. So most of the discussions are about marriage, love, and family issues. As the saying goes, "Even an honest official finds it hard to judge family matters," but the editors of the various newspapers actually answer every question, which is quite painstaking. On Sunday mornings, there is an illustrated magazine, or cartoons, or scenes of local scenery and life, occupying a page. Originally, there was also an evening edition on Sundays, but the various newspapers have recently agreed to abolish it.</p>
<p>The talks published in the newspapers are also very interesting. For example, the Chrysanthemum Talk, where the newspaper sends out invitations in advance, inviting many chrysanthemum experts to participate in a tea party. Each person speaks freely, expressing their grand theories. The next day, they are published in the newspaper, providing the readers with a paper conversation. This type of talk has a wide scope and is finely categorized. Even the makeup methods of actresses can become the subject of a talk. Newspaper companies often provide large companies with space to hold exhibitions or host readers for travel and excursions. Sometimes, the newspaper includes discount coupons for movie theaters, so readers can enjoy various unexpected benefits in addition to reading the newspaper.</p>
<p>After the newspaper business develops, the facilities are naturally perfect. The Asahi and Mainichi newspapers both use airplanes for transportation. Tokyo newspapers are distributed at six or seven in the morning, while newspapers in Chiba Prefecture arrive before four in the morning, when readers are still in sweet dreams. During the great flood in Kyoto, there were five or six extra editions a day, almost every two or three hours. The newsboys who issued the extra editions wore copper bells, running around and distributing the newspapers. As long as you hear the sound of the bell, the residents naturally become tense. The newsstands at street corners also shake a string of copper bells, which is different from the Chinese newsboys who shout "X Newspaper, XX Newspaper."</p>
<p>Art Exhibition News: Zhao Anzhi, a painter from Wujin, recently opened a solo exhibition at the First Park in the capital, with over two hundred works on display. His subjects include figures, landscapes, birds, and insects, and his imitation Song dynasty cloth paintings are particularly distinctive. Zhao's cloth paintings take inspiration from the Song dynasty. I hope that writers and collectors will promote them as much as possible, so that the value of our domestic cloth will increase tenfold from now on. Perhaps in a few years, it will be comparable to Song brocade.</p>
<h3>Xiaoxitian</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Episode 11: Gently Leaning, the Moon-like Beauty is Pitied in the Courtyard; Ardently Scolding the Son-in-Law, the Lion's Roar is Heard from the Next Room</p>
<p>When Bei Hai saw Yue Ying in this state, his expression naturally changed. Since marrying Jia Duocai, Yue Ying had never been so close to Bei Hai, and with Jia Duocai standing right there, she couldn't say whether it was shame or regret, but she felt that if there were cracks in the ground, she would squat down and crawl into them. Bei Hai glanced at him and saw that his face was red and purple, his eyelids were drooping, and there seemed to be tears in the corners of his eyes. He hurriedly covered his mouth with his hand and coughed lightly twice. Turning back, he saw a woman standing in front of him, and he dared not look at her for more than a second, immediately hurrying towards the backyard. After reaching the backyard, for some reason, his feet stopped on their own accord. At this moment, a second thought commanded him to turn around, so he turned back to the corner of the wall, hiding his body behind it, and poked his head out to look into the front hall. As luck would have it, Mrs. Zhou was talking to Jia Duocai, her eyes not looking elsewhere. Yue Ying took a step back, tilted her body, and turned her head to look behind her. Clearly, she was looking at Bei Hai's shadow, and so the two of them looked at each other. Yue Ying did not have this intention when she turned her head to look at him this time. Not having this intention and still turning her head, this was something she could not understand herself. Unexpectedly, Bei Hai had not left and was still lingering there, which was beyond her expectations, adding a touch of excitement to her shame and regret. Not only did her face turn red, but her heart also pounded wildly. (361)</p>

<h3>Routes of Transmission of Pathogenic Microorganisms</h3>
<p>— Translated by Dr. Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>Sanitary organisms fall into two categories: one is the lowest form of plant, called fungi; the other is the lowest form of animal, called protozoa. Anything harmful to the human body that causes disease is collectively called a pathogenic microorganism. There are two routes of transmission into the human body, outlined as follows.</p>
<p>(1) Invasion through the outer skin! Such as tetanus bacilli, rabies virus, pyogenic bacteria, bubonic plague bacteria, etc.</p>
<p>(2) Invasion through the inner skin! Such as (A) cholera vibrio, typhoid bacillus, dysentery bacillus, anthrax bacillus, tuberculosis bacillus, syphilis spirochetes, etc., that invade through the esophagus; (B) tuberculosis bacillus, pneumococcus, scarlet fever bacteria, bubonic plague bacteria, etc., that invade through the trachea; (C) gonococcus, syphilis spirochetes, puerperal fever bacteria, etc., that invade through the urethra.</p>
<p>The above is only a brief overview; more detailed discussion will follow.</p>
<h3>Holistic Treatment for Weakness of the Sexual Glands</h3>
<p>— Dr. Qiao Wenbin</p>
<p>Weakness of the sexual glands manifests in many conditions, the most significant of which include spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, testicular atrophy, back pain, and premature aging. If left untreated, various symptoms of weakness will arise and multiply, leading to a life of misery.</p>
<p>Treatment should address both the symptoms and the root cause. Himitol's Spermatorrhea Pills are a specialized medicine for treating spermatorrhea, addressing the symptoms. Genital Essence treats premature ejaculation, testicular atrophy, back pain, and all other symptoms of weakness, addressing the root cause. The two can be taken together for synergistic effect. However, if there is no spermatorrhea, Genital Essence can be taken alone, two tablets three times a day. If suffering from both spermatorrhea and other symptoms, add two Himitol's Spermatorrhea Pills before bedtime.</p>
<p>This holistic treatment method is based on our clinical experience. Patients can treat themselves according to this method to avoid the inconvenience of seeking medical attention.</p>
<h3>A Healthy Stomach Leads to a Healthy Body</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yu Bofu</p>
<p>The stomach is the source of nourishment for all parts of the human body. The strength or weakness of the body depends on the abundance or scarcity of nutrition. A weak stomach leads to indigestion and decreased appetite, resulting in symptoms such as emaciation and weakness. A healthy stomach leads to a strong appetite, improved digestion, and adequate nutrition, resulting in weight gain, full muscles, and a strong, healthy body. Therefore, those who care about their health should prioritize strengthening their stomach.</p>
<p>Our clinical experience shows that "Stomachache Relief" is effective in treating acute and chronic gastritis, hyperacidity, stomach spasms, gastric dilatation, gastric prolapse, and cold, heat, and nerve pain in the stomach. "Stomach Strengthener" is effective in treating weak stomach, indigestion, food stagnation, constipation, poor digestion, and loss of appetite. These two remedies, one to treat the disease and one to nourish the root, are truly a wonderful combination that complements each other.</p>
<h3>Himitol's Spermatorrhea Pills Save Me from Spermatorrhea</h3>
<p>— Contribution from Yang Zhongli</p>
<p>During my adolescence, I was led astray by bad friends and got caught up in self-destruction through masturbation. For three or four years, I never stopped, which damaged my body and weakened my spirit. Later, as I was about to get married, I began to abstain, but I had already developed spermatorrhea. At first, it happened a few times a month, but then gradually increased to more than twenty times. My face was sallow, my muscles were thin, my mind was weak, and my body was exhausted. I took various kidney-tonifying and essence-replenishing medicines, but they were all of limited effectiveness. Later, Mr. Qi Chuqiang introduced me to Dr. Zhan Nianceng for treatment. I was instructed to purchase Himitol's Spermatorrhea Pills and Genital Essence from Zhongxi Pharmacy. After taking five boxes, I immediately felt my complexion become rosy, my breathing become full, my marrow was replenished, and my libido was revived. The illness I had suffered from in the past had vanished. (Continued below)</p>
<h3>A Case of Curing Neurasthenia</h3>
<p>— Dr. Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>Patient Min Shiliang, 37 years old, weakened his mind and body due to excessive studying during his school days. After marriage, his body became even weaker, with night sweats, palpitations, dizziness, blurred vision, tremors, cold limbs, and lower back pain. He saw doctors and took medicine, but had no effect and became pessimistic, constantly thinking about ending his life. This spring, he suddenly suffered from premature ejaculation and seminal emission, which was extremely painful. Mr. Ma Zhongsheng introduced him to me for treatment. I found that his sexual nerves were in a state of extreme weakness. In addition to using the latest scientific surgical radio wave therapy, I also instructed him to purchase "Genital Essence" from Zhengwei Pharmacy. After taking about half a dozen, he felt that the symptoms had disappeared, his waist and back were strong, his blood and kidneys were full, and his muscles were full. He was like a completely different person.</p>
<h3>Breaking the Smoking Habit Early Without Any Pain</h3>
<p>— Contribution from Lao Fulin</p>
<p>Due to congenital deficiencies in my youth, my body was weak. As I grew up, I suffered from many illnesses and could not sustain my energy, so I smoked to try to invigorate myself. I became addicted to smoking. I once thought about quitting, but ultimately could not succeed due to the pain of withdrawal. Now, because the government is determined to ban drugs and the laws are strict, I had to find a painless way to quit smoking. Fortunately, Mr. Xu Ciyuan introduced me to Genital Essence. Not only did I not experience any pain during withdrawal, but my spirit was joyful and the withdrawal period was shortened beyond my expectations. I am writing this to be published in your journal, so that others who are in the same situation as me can learn from my experience.</p>
<h3>Masturbation Damages the Body and Causes Many Diseases</h3>
<p>— Dr. Wang Shiying</p>
<p>Patient Xiao Guoxun was poisoned by erotic books in his youth and excessively depleted his energy and vitality. Although he later quit, he suffered from insomnia, seminal emission, and other symptoms that led to a weak mind and depleted essence. His memory also sharply declined, and his stomach became sluggish, resulting in a lack of nutrition, thin muscles, and a sallow complexion. He saw doctors and took medicine, but it was like a mud cow entering the sea. This summer, he came to me for treatment due to dizziness, lower back pain, palpitations, and night sweats. I found that his entire body was in a state of deep weakness, so I provided him with a comprehensive treatment. I instructed him to purchase Himitol's Spermatorrhea Pills and Genital Essence from Zhongying Pharmacy and take them together for more than a month. All the symptoms disappeared, seminal emission was cured, he slept soundly at night, his mind was clear, and his limbs were relaxed, strong, and comfortable, as he had never been before.</p>
<h3>My Personal Experience Self-Treating Leucorrhea</h3>
<p>— Contribution from Qiao Tiankang</p>
<p>My wife, née Sun, comes from a distinguished family. She is naturally beautiful and lovely. However, due to her weak body, she is very prone to illness. Last year, she suddenly suffered from leucorrhea, with moisture and erosion in the vagina and a foul-smelling purulent discharge. This lasted for several months, and then she developed lower abdominal pain. I tried to find a self-treatment method, but could not find one. Later, I submitted a letter to your journal's Q&amp;A column and was instructed to purchase Leucorrhea Cure from Zhongxi Pharmacy. I placed one piece in the vagina every other day according to the instructions. During the first three or four days, even more purulent secretions were discharged. From the fifth day onwards, the discharge gradually decreased. From the ninth day onwards, the lower abdominal pain was cured and the leucorrhea disappeared. In total, I used one and a half boxes and was completely cured. Leucorrhea Cure is truly a secret treasure for self-treatment of women's hidden illnesses.</p>

<p>Frequent Spermatorrhea During Quitting Smoking</p>
<p>Patient Li Quqing has always been weak and suffered from many diseases. Because seeing doctors and taking medicine had no effect, he resorted to smoking for temporary relief. Later, he became addicted and could not quit. Last year, after seeing that his friend Mr. Tang had a good experience after quitting smoking, he also went to a certain hospital to quit. Unexpectedly, Mr. Li was weaker and not as strong as Mr. Tang, so he suffered from headaches, spermatorrhea, diarrhea, and lower back pain during the withdrawal. It was too painful, so he gave up halfway. This spring, because his spermatorrhea became increasingly severe, he came to me for treatment. I instructed him to quit smoking while I carefully took responsibility for preventing various diseases. I instructed him to purchase Genital Essence and Himitol's Spermatorrhea Pills from Diancheng Pharmacy. Mr. Li followed the instructions and, as expected, did not suffer from spermatorrhea. Instead, his spirit became more cheerful and his withdrawal period was one-third shorter than Mr. Tang's. After quitting, his body became strong and healthy, and his muscles became firm. He was like a completely different person compared to his weak and sickly past.</p>
<p>Testicular Atrophy and Premature Ejaculation Treated</p>
<p>Patient Jiang Xidun, 22 years old, from Gaoqiao, works at the post office. During his adolescence, he was poisoned by erotic books and mistakenly masturbated. After marriage, he indulged excessively, which led to both testicular atrophy and premature ejaculation. He purchased a certain tonic pill, but it turned out to be a stimulant, which depleted him even more. His mind and body were exhausted and he was unable to sustain himself. Later, Mr. Ge Zhaolin introduced him to me for treatment. I found that his sexual glands were extremely weak. In addition to using the latest scientific surgical radio wave sensory transmission therapy, I also instructed him to purchase Stanard's Genital Essence from Wuzhou Pharmacy. After more than four weeks, all the symptoms disappeared. His waist and back became strong, he regained his youth, and his testicular atrophy and premature ejaculation were both cured. His spirit was invigorated and his Qi and blood were full. He said that he had never felt so good before.</p>

<h3>Gold Market on Currency Swap Day: Price Fluctuations Based on Forward Premium</h3>
<p>Despite Midday Rumors of Currency Swap or Lower Prices Leading to Rises, Forward Premium Gradually Increased, Resulting in a Final Drop of Two and a Half Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market experienced a currency swap day, with many major players remaining on the sidelines. However, due to prior speculation that the forward premium might reach six or seven yuan, there was a temporary rebound midday. Unexpectedly, after trading commenced, the premium gradually increased, eventually leading to a decline. In the morning, overseas silver markets showed stability in both London and New York. The forward silver price in Montreux rose by 3.7% and contracted by varying degrees. Exchange rates slightly narrowed. London spot gold fell by 1.5 pence. The Central Bank's official exchange rate announcement showed no change in British or American currencies, and the customs gold unit remained unchanged. The standard gold price was listed at 1,149.6 yuan, but market sentiment remained calm. The morning opened with lower prices, and after the opening, major players took advantage of the low prices to purchase, driving prices up. However, banks took the opportunity to sell at higher prices, making further increases difficult. Mobil was locking in near-term U.S. dollars, anticipating the HSBC exchange rate, which showed a stable British pound and a slightly contracted U.S. dollar at 0.0625. At this point, fluctuations were minimal, with supply and demand in balance. Banks' appetite remained sluggish, and forward prices slightly hardened but then declined slightly. However, due to rumors that this currency swap would at most involve the short side paying a premium of six or seven yuan, market sentiment improved, stimulating buying interest. Mobil continued to lock in U.S. dollars, gradually tightening the near-term market and driving prices up. However, major players gradually supplied at higher prices, and soon the market gradually declined. Predictions indicated no change in Indian silver. At noon, the overall trend was stable. In the afternoon, due to the rising forward premium for currency swaps, the market shifted from stable to weak. Although there was a slight rebound after the opening, the increasingly high forward premium gradually became unsustainable. When the currency swap officially opened, rising to a premium of 12.8 yuan for the short side, selling pressure intensified, breaking the 40 yuan barrier. Buyers maintained support by buying at lower prices. After the currency swap opened, prices fell back, returning to the previous levels. However, prices consistently failed to break above 42 yuan. In the end, the currency swap once again aided the short side, leading to renewed weakness. The future trend remains one of consolidation. As for this currency swap, predictions beforehand were varied. During the preliminary trading in the afternoon, the initial bids were for the long side to pay a premium of seven or eight yuan, but there were few takers. When the official trading opened, the premium surprisingly rose to 12.8 yuan, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of over 1.1%, attracting investment from major players and retreating to 11.3 yuan. However, the short side had a considerable amount of spot goods, making it difficult for buyers to avoid crowding, and the premium eventually increased to over 13 yuan. The day's market conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1,141.3 yuan, down 1.3 yuan from the previous closing. It then became one yuan. Hengyu, Huixiang, Fuxing, Yongyuanmao, Yongtongchun, Changri, and Chunlaijin rose to 2.8 yuan. Dadecheng and Deli sold, falling to 2.1 yuan. Dadecheng then rose again to 2.8 yuan. Maijia Li bought January U.S. dollars at 0.0625. Huixiang and Hengyu sold to 2.1 yuan. Mobil bought November U.S. dollars at half a yuan, anticipating the HSBC exchange rate, which showed a stable British pound and a slightly contracted U.S. dollar at 0.0625. The situation was calm. Dachangxiang, Dadecheng, Huixiang, and Laijin rose to 2.8 yuan. Youli sold January U.S. dollars at 0.125. Dadecheng, Hengyu, Huixiang, Yicheng, and Fuyu divested, falling to 1.8 yuan. Dadecheng, Yuanyingfeng, Hengyicheng, Richang, Fuxing, Yongrichang, Fuyu, Qianchangxiang, and Luxu successively purchased, rising to 5.4 yuan, mainly because Liang Yiwei said the forward premium for currency swaps would at most be six or seven yuan, and a certain bank was also purchasing. Yingxiang and Fuxing Yongzhentai took the opportunity to sell, falling to 3.6 yuan. Dingkang, Huixiang, Qianchangxiang, and Laijin rose again to 5.5 yuan. Fuxing Yong limited sales and slightly consolidated. Dadecheng, Hengyu, and retail investors re-entered, rising to 6 yuan. Yuanyong, Fuxing Yong, Yifeng Yong, Hengyu, and Futaiyong successively divested at 3.8 yuan. Richang and Hengyu further rose to 4.4 yuan. Fuxing and Dadecheng continued to sell and fell to 2.8 yuan. Yingfeng, Hengfuyu, and Dadecheng Laijin, with no change predicted for Indian silver, rebounded to 3.8 yuan. Hengxing still had selling appetite, and the body rotated. The noon closing was 1,143.7 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon opening was 1,142.7 yuan. Fuyu and Yuanmaoyong divested, falling to 2 yuan. Yuanmaoyong Yifengyong Laijin gradually rose to 3.7 yuan. The forward premium for currency swaps increased, and Dadecheng Yongli Hengyu Wanfenghouyu Yiyanyong successively supplied, falling to 39.5 yuan. Qianchangxiang Yifeng Fuxing Yong took the opportunity to buy at low prices. After the currency swap opened, it gradually fell, rebounding to 41.9 yuan. Chunyuanyong Qingfayong Xiangfeng Dingtai divested, falling to 0.8 yuan. Hengyu Richang Chunyuanyong Shangna rose to 1.6 yuan. Qingfayong and others continued to supply, and the closing price fell again to 1,140.1 yuan.</p>
<p>The settlement price was set with the Central Bank's standard gold price listed at 1,149.6 yuan, approximately 9 yuan lower than the declared price, and 3 yuan weaker than the previous closing. The registration price for this month was 1,134 yuan, and for December it was 1,144 yuan. The morning supplemental water was 1,134 yuan, and the afternoon supplemental water was 1,130 yuan. The pure gold price was equal to the standard gold price at 1,141.3 yuan. The spot market was stable. Tianjin goods were quoted at a premium of 7 yuan, but there were no transactions. The premium for 粭赤 was 7.5 yuan. Yingji Hengyue invested approximately 200 taels, quoted at a premium of 7 yuan.</p>
<p>There were few transactions in the market. In total, Yingfeng Heng Richang Dadecheng Dingkang Yifeng Yongtong Taichang Huixiang, etc., were on the buying side. Fuyu Chunyuanyong Qingfayong Yong Hengxing Hengyu Hengchang Yongyuanmaoyong Wanyan, etc., were on the selling side. Fuxing Yongchunyuanyong went out first and then came in. Dingkang Futaiyong advanced first and then exited. Dasu Bangshunli Wanxing had little activity. Guangbang was very quiet. Hengxing slightly exited.</p>
<p>The day's market conditions were difficult to invigorate. The morning opening was 1,141.3 yuan, and the closing was 1,140.1 yuan. The highest price was 1,146.5 yuan, and the lowest price was 1,139.5 yuan, a fluctuation of 7 yuan. As a result, it fell another 2.5 yuan from the previous closing. It was rare for public orders this month. Yesterday, the short side still had not settled, so there was no settlement today. The total number of transactions was 7,315 in the morning and 16,059 in the afternoon.</p>
<p>For the December currency swap, the preliminary off-exchange bids were for the short side to pay a premium of seven or eight yuan, but there were few transactions. The long side, such as Tongtaichang Yongli Yifeng Yongtong Yurun Kang Richang Yuxinxiang Dachangxiang Hengchangyong Wanfeng, etc., immediately came to pay the premium. Only Hengyu Yuanmaoyong slightly paid the premium midway, lacking a long side, gradually rising to around 9.5 yuan. Hengyu Yicheng Qianchangxiang Yingfeng Heng Fuxing Yong took the opportunity to pay the premium, falling to around 9 yuan. Shenfeng Chunyuanyong Yuanmaoyong Huixiang Dadecheng Yuxinxiang Hengchangyong Wanxing paid the premium, rising again to outside 10 yuan. After this, the long side became even more scarce. Shenfeng Hengchangyong Huixiang Fuxing Yongshunli scrambled to pay the premium. When the official trading opened at 1 o'clock, the long side paid a premium of 12.8 yuan. Subsequently, Shunli Tongtaichang still came to pay the premium and hovered around 13 yuan. Dingkang Chunyuanyong Fuxing Yongyifengyong Futaiyong Hengxing advanced to pay the premium, suddenly retreating to 11.3 yuan. Yuanmaoyong Fuxingyong Dadecheng Hengyu Chunyuanyong successively paid the premium. Midway, although Yifengyong Yongfeng Dingtai Qingfayong paid the premium and consolidated, the retail short side also poured in. The closing price rebounded to 12.5 yuan. After the closing, Hengyu Yongfeng Fuxingyong, etc., still came to pay the premium, and reaching around 13.5 yuan, there were few takers.</p>

<h3>Call Loan Rate Drops Another Point</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the financial market situation was stable. Regarding collateral loans, due to various rumors, new loans were temporarily suspended. However, yesterday was a major bi-monthly settlement period, so various settlements were slightly busier. The call loan rate for foreign banks gradually decreased in a stable situation. Yesterday, it decreased by one point, reaching 1.2%, the same in the morning and afternoon. Since the implementation of the legal tender policy, Liu Tou's backing has gradually become more ample, and remittances have been made for days, which was no exception yesterday. There were still no additions from outside. Call loan transactions totaled over 2.8 million in the morning, with new transactions totaling over 500,000. Afternoon transactions totaled over 400,000, with the small general association totaling over 600,000. The amount of foreign collateral loans redeemed was over 300,000, with new loans totaling over 500,000. The outflow of banknotes from the local area was over 1.2 million, and to other areas it was over 900,000.

<h3>Securities Market Sentiment is Anxious and Panicked, Bond Market Fluctuates Like a Parabola</h3>
<p>—Low at the Beginning and End, Slightly Higher in the Middle—</p>
<p>Weak, still showing signs of a rebound. The environmental news is still chaotic, with rumors and anxieties intensifying. The prevalence of rumors is unbearable to hear. It is only heard that three banks are once again pulling up the market in order to maintain prices, but unfortunately, market prices are still at their peak, making it difficult to pull up. The public bond investors are mostly selling, and each sale has physical goods. The submitted amount of physical goods is between 30 and 40 million, which proves the strength of the short side. The situation is far from the speculative gold market, where the long side can monopolize. Furthermore, in this environment and at this market price, effective pulling up is likely not the right time. The future situation is still very chaotic and should still be shifted based on the situation at any time. Yesterday's trading was very active, with sessions in the morning and the afternoon. During the morning session, market sentiment was extremely anxious, with the cutting of military expenses falling sharply by two yuan and something, and the remainder falling by a small number of jiao to about one yuan. However, since the long term of the 20th series rose, driven by the pulling of the 46th series and others, it gradually moved upward. The whole 6th series increased by more than 7.5 jiao. The buying and selling trends were opposite. The selling from the northern gang was still strong, and the 43rd and 48th series were still mostly selling. The afternoon session did not open until after 4:00. The military expenses rebounded by 6 jiao to 1.5 jiao. After entering the session, starting from the 20th series, the selling from the 43rd, 48th, 54th and the northern gang was extremely enthusiastic. The methods for pulling up the market failed to be effective, and the prices dropped by 3-5 jiao to 6-7 jiao. The trend may go through a period of chaos, but it is extremely difficult to be optimistic. The market price results showed a mixed bag of increases and decreases. There were nine types that showed a decrease, falling by a small amount, such as 1-2 jiao to 1.45 yuan. There were six types that showed an increase, increasing by an insignificant amount, such as 0.05-0.1 jiao to 0.6 jiao. The total trading volume was roughly around 35 million. The results of the increases and decreases are listed and compared below: (Unit Yuan, Unit Hundred Yuan)</p>

<p>New Stocks Reach Highest Price in Four Years</p>
<p>According to a report from Xinhua Foreign Company, yesterday (14th), New York stocks rose to their highest price in the past four years. Commerce Secretary Zabpan stated that former President Roosevelt and Howard wrote in a letter that the reform process was complete, and that the President must act in accordance with his words, in other words, that industry and commerce need no longer be afraid. The activity of trading was unprecedented since February 7, 1934. At the opening, there were frequent transactions of 10,000 shares per transaction. The teletype machine was lagging behind by as much as five minutes. Steel stocks were the strongest, with U.S. Steel, Bethlehem Steel, and National Steel all creating new highs for 1935. Railroad stocks also rose. The local securities company announced the issuance of a dividend of 0.2 yuan, which was the first time since 1931. Union Pacific Railroad announced that it would issue the usual quarterly dividend of 1.5 yuan. Both of these contributed significantly to the rise in railroad stocks. Automobile stocks and entertainment stocks were actively bought. In the end, there was a slight pullback due to the emergence of more profit-taking. Small exchange stocks and the bond market also rose. The total transaction volume for the day was 3.95 million shares.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Estimated Drastic Reduction in Cotton Production, Cotton Market Feels Increasingly Firm, Ultimately Diverging from the Yarn Market</h3>
<p>The cotton market is very firm, which is inversely proportional to the yarn market. As American cotton rises, Indian cotton also steps in its footprints. The estimated price of foreign cotton continues to increase. Because of this, Japanese companies are constantly buying Chinese cotton. The market price is being drawn tighter and tighter. Banks are buying. Not only are they not selling, but they are also buying more when prices drop. The long side is gaining a lot, and they are not letting go.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Opens Another High</p>
<p>The opening market for bid cotton shows a very tight trend. Since the rise in the American cotton market is intensifying, with the spot price already outside the 0.12 yuan level, and there are constant export transactions for appointment cotton, market sentiment is relatively boosted. The prices for all months open higher across the board, which is inversely proportional to the yarn market. The prices rebounded slightly during the second session, but they went back up at the closing. As a result, the prices for all months rose by 0.35-0.5 yuan compared to the closing prices from the previous day. Although there were large-scale sales from Jinzi Bang and Dafu, Yuanyi, and Gengfeng during the afternoon opening, Meiji and banks bought everything. The market relies on their support. Moreover, the second release from the Chinese Cotton Industry Statistics Association estimated the total cotton production for the entire country at 8,391,018 bales, which is a large decrease of 1,205,666 bales compared to the previous estimate of 9,596,684 dan. The market did not know about this news at the closing, but it is also beneficial for the long side. As a result, the price for each month fell by 0.05-0.2 yuan compared to the afternoon closing price. The selling in this month increased by 0.05 yuan.</p>
<p>The amount of cotton sold: Dafu 7,100 dan, Yuanda 1,000 dan, Shenji 1,200 dan, Renfeng 1,000 dan, Yuanyi 6,300 dan, 4,200 dan, Xi Lanli 6,900 dan.</p>
<p>The amount of cotton bought: Tonghe 1,300 dan, Gengfeng 1,200 dan, Yikang 3,100 dan, Changhe 3,400 dan, Meiji 9,200 dan, Yuda 1,700 dan, Tongji 1,500 dan, Tongfeng 1,500 dan, and Changfeng 1,600 dan.</p>
<p>The daily highest and lowest prices and closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Bid Cotton Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Increase/Decrease Number of Contracts</p>

<h3>Heavy Pressure in the Yarn Market</h3>
<p>The yarn market, after an initial rise, has continued to fall, and the situation is unusually stagnant. This is because the pressure from the environment is increasing, and people are in a state of unease and uncertainty. At the same time, spot yarn sales are sluggish, and the various guilds are extremely unmotivated to buy. Recently, securities have declined, buying sentiment has been further dampened, and the cotton market is quite expensive, increasing the factory's cost calculations. Therefore, some parties have adopted a strategy of buying on dips, but in reality, there is a lack of demand for spot yarn, making it difficult to raise market prices.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Initially Rises, Ultimately Falls</p>
<p>At the opening of the forward yarn market, prices for each month were still hit by rumors, and all opened lower, falling by seven or eight jiao. However, prices for distant months did not fall. Prices were stable in the first two sessions, but in the third session, due to the strength of raw cotton, short positions were covered, and prices for near months jumped up by seven or eight jiao to one yuan. However, the market situation was calm. By the close, news of weak spot yarn demand caused prices to turn downwards. As a result, prices for each month rose by two to five and eight jiao compared to the previous day's close. At the opening in the afternoon, rumors flourished, and the market suddenly loosened. He Xing and Ren Feng dumped yarn again, and prices for each month uniformly fell by one, two, three, and four yuan. The reason for this was very little spot sales. However, in the second and third sessions, the cotton market was supported by foreign purchases, and the yarn market rebounded by several jiao. As a result, prices for each month fell by six and eight jiao to one yuan and two jiao compared to the morning close, but this month's prices only fell by one jiao. It was found that Jin Chang sold 1,050 bales, Mei Ji 300 bales, Yong Chang 500 bales, Da Fu 450 bales, Yu Da 850 bales, He Xing 1,450 bales, Geng Feng 900 bales, Ren Feng 1,000 bales, and Sheng Yuan 700 bales. Yuan Yi bought 500 bales, Chang Feng 1,250 bales, Run Kang 1,250 bales, Yuan Da 400 bales, Chang Yu 550 bales, Yi Chang 650 bales, and Tong He 850 bales. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>

<p>Yarn Sales Extremely Sluggish</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are extremely limited. It was found that the total amount purchased by all guilds for the entire day was only 363 bales. Prices were no different from the previous day. The purchase amounts of each guild are listed below:</p>

<h3>Second Estimate of This Year's Cotton Production</h3>
<p>The China Cotton Industry Statistics Association announced the second estimate of national cotton production for the 24th year at 5:00 PM on November 15, 1935, as follows:</p>
<p>Cotton Field Area 35,485,818 mu</p>
<p>Abandoned Field Area 12,291,200 mu</p>
<p>Ginned Cotton Production 8,391,018 dan</p>
<p>The above estimates (1) are based on reports from twelve provinces, including Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Sichuan (Sichuan is a newly added province this year; previous years did not include Sichuan), and the two cities of Shanghai and Tianjin; (2) are based on the cotton crop situation before November 10; (3) include all losses from disasters suffered by the cotton crop in each province before November 10; (4) cotton fields are measured in mu (60 square zhang per mu), and cotton production is measured in dan (100 jin per dan).</p>

<p>The national cotton crop this year, following the progress of the 10th year, still showed a trend of increasing cotton fields in various provinces at the beginning of planting. However, during the sowing season, the Yellow River basin, such as Shandong, Henan, and Hebei provinces, experienced severe drought, resulting in many abandoned fields where sowing was not possible, germination failed, or seedlings did not grow. The Yangtze River basin, on the other hand, was relatively good. Around the time of flowering, the drought in Shandong and Henan provinces began to ease, but Hubei province suddenly reported flooding, and a large area of cotton-growing regions was submerged, resulting in abandoned fields. According to this estimate, the number of abandoned fields nationwide this year reached as high as 12,291,300 mu, the highest record in cotton production statistics. The cotton crop situation, according to the first estimate, was good in various provinces in winter, and even in disaster-stricken areas, recovery after the disaster was fast. Therefore, although there was significant damage to fields due to disasters, it was still possible to produce more than 9,596,000 dan of cotton, with an average yield of 26.6 jin per mu. After the first estimate, Shandong and Henan provinces, which were the most severely affected by the drought in the Yellow River basin, showed some improvement due to favorable weather during the boll-forming period, and production increased compared to the first estimate. Hebei remained unchanged, but Shanxi and Shaanxi saw reduced production due to continuous rain. The Yangtze River basin mostly saw a decrease, especially in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The typhoons that have historically had the greatest impact on cotton harvests in Jiangsu and Zhejiang after autumn were fortunately avoided this year, but continuous rain and widespread pests caused the cotton production, which had shown promise of a good harvest in the first estimate, to decline sharply. The national cotton production also decreased as a result, falling to 8,391,018 dan, a decrease of 11.6 percent compared to the first estimate, and the average yield also decreased to 23.6 jin per mu.</p>
<p>The second estimate for this year, showing the area of existing cotton fields, area of abandoned fields, and ginned cotton production for each province, is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Existing Cotton Field Area (mu) Abandoned Field Area (mu) Ginned Cotton Production (dan)</p>
<p>Hebei 6,315,970 2,620,100 2,166,492</p>

<p>American Cotton Spot Price Up 2 Points</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the opening of the American cotton market, trading was active, and prices for each month rose by two to six points. According to predictions, the 12-cent loan will be extended to after January 2nd. The government's attitude is said to be firmer than before. At the same time, stocks were strong, and news from Liverpool was good. Unfavorable forecasts for the West, along with consistent buying by fellow brokers and foreign firms, caused market prices to rise gradually. There was strong hedging at the opening, but it disappeared later, further intensifying buying sentiment. As a result, spot prices rose by 20 points, and futures prices rose by 21 to 23 points. English cotton spot prices fell by four points, and futures prices rose by 11 to 12 points. Indian cotton trading was light, with speculators buying and a few European exporters selling. Pingle remained unchanged, Omra fell by half a rupee, and Bai Luo Creek fell by 0.25 rupees, according to the original telegram (dated 14th).</p>

<h3>Many Rumors in the Grain Market, Flour and Wheat Affected</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the opening of the flour market in the morning, prices for each month once saw a rebound due to the rising prices of foreign wheat by five or six jiao. As the ordering of foreign wheat has not materialized, buying sentiment remained active both inside and outside the industry. Prices for each month rose by two to three fen at the opening. Later, due to rumors about the situation, bulls adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and there was a surge of floating short positions, causing prices to fall back by one fen. At the opening in the afternoon, prices initially remained flat, but then, due to very quiet departures from the market, with a transaction volume of only over 200,000 in half a day, outsiders continued to buy in due to the uncertainty of foreign wheat. Although near-term prices were flat, far-term prices rose by more than three fen. It is observed that subsequent movements may also be related to the future of the situation.</p>

<p>Yesterday, at the opening of the wheat market in the morning, prices for this month rose by three or four jiao due to the rebounding prices of foreign wheat by around five or six jiao. However, prices for far-term months remained stagnant as buying and selling parties adopted a wait-and-see approach. Contracts from January onwards were sold off session after session. At the opening in the afternoon, trading had become lively, but market prices were mixed. Due to rumors about the situation in the near term, bulls were selling off. Far-term prices were initially very flat, with the January contract falling by four or five fen, but then rebounded due to the rebound in the flour market. However, the increase was moderate and not as sharp as the week before. The spot wheat market remains stable, with Shandong Bengbu wheat opening at 4.93 yuan, Huai'an wheat at 4.92 yuan, Xiping wheat at 4.90 yuan, and Shaoxing wheat at 4.78 yuan, totaling 3,000 bags, reportedly handled by Xin Da.</p>

<h3>Ke Xian Still Falling, Du Mi Xuan Settled</h3>
<p>(Hu Nan) Yesterday, sources from various guilds arrived with a total of more than 30 consignments (totaling over 6,000 shi). Sales were normal. Fortunately, the rain kept people calm, so the prices of various goods were generally stable. The prices of new japonica rice such as Hou Zao and Du Yang Jian Yin Bian Yuan varieties remained unchanged. The majority of Bo Dao rice continued to be purchased by guilds from Tianjin, Qingdao, and Yantai, totaling more than 2,000 bags, with a slight premium for unique varieties. However, retail sales still felt sluggish.</p>
<p>(Hu Bei) Sources from 38 or 39 consignments. The market for various goods was still normal, but then sales from shops became more active, and the market price of Bai Jing rice stabilized in the morning, but then tightened by several fen in the afternoon. The price of Bo Dao rice remained stable, Early rice showed some weakness, Yang Du Bu Jian remained stable. Ke Jian was inactive, and the retail sales of new and old Bian Yuan varieties were sluggish, with prices slightly lower. The remaining goods were similar to the previous market.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of Ke Xian rice was very strong, while Ke Hua rice was stagnant. Purchases by the Beiyang guild were even weaker yesterday, and there were no smooth sales in this street either. The total market only handled 875 bags of Gan rice, 137 bags of Yong rice, and 1,642 bags of Wen Tai rice, totaling less than 3,000 bags, with prices falling sharply by two or three jiao. Imported rice stocks have dwindled, and merchants are still quoting high prices. Some merchants are holding firm and refusing to sell, so the market is stronger than that of Ke Xian rice. It is said that there were no sales throughout the day.</p>
<h3>Dried Longan Meat from Shi Ma Yuan Rises, Land Price Up 8 Yuan</h3>
<p>According to a letter from Zhangzhou, the price of sun-dried Shi Ma Yuan dried longan meat has recently risen by seven or eight yuan due to the scarcity of stock. The owners are selling less. If the Nanyang guild has further sales, it will inevitably continue to rise. Stocks in Shanghai are also low, but sales are not high, so prices are temporarily stabilizing.</p>

<p>Special Telecommunications Supplement</p>
<h3>Respectful Announcement to Overseas Representatives of the Fifth National Congress from the International Radio Station</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>The Fifth National Congress, which has attracted worldwide attention, opened in Nanjing on the 12th of this month. The representatives, as the backbone of the Party, have come from afar with the sincere intention of uniting to overcome national difficulties. Their presence at the Congress, with their grand plans and wise discussions, will surely fulfill our hopes. Among the Congress representatives are 90 overseas representatives, who are concerned about the perilous state of the motherland and are making inspections of their homeland. Their significance is particularly important and great. Since the outbreak of national crisis, various construction projects in the country have made considerable achievements. If the representatives were to make a casual inspection, they would know the details. In the realm of telecommunications, we at the International Radio Station would like to briefly explain the international telecommunications business, which is closely related to overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>For the past 50 years, our country's international telecommunications business has been managed by foreign underwater cable companies. Not only has there been a huge loss of telegraph fees flowing overseas every year, but our sovereignty has also been undermined. The control of communication between overseas Chinese and our countrymen, in particular, has been a political and economic detriment. It was not until the government established itself in the north and south in the 17th year of the Republic of China, creating a new nation, that it sought to safeguard the independence of our external communications sovereignty. Thus, the Ministry of Communications built the National International Radio Station in Shanghai. After eight years of effort, the following direct communication circuits were established: (1) China-America route: Direct communication with the American Radio Corporation in San Francisco, with the latter's radio station and Western Union Telegraph Company relaying telegrams to various places in North and South America.</p>
<p>(2) China-America route: Direct communication with the Mackay Company's radio station in San Francisco, with the latter's radio station and the Postal Telegraph Company relaying telegrams to various places in North and South America.</p>
<p>(3) China-Germany route: Direct communication with the German Postal and Telegraph Department's radio station in Berlin, directly reaching various places in Germany, and relaying telegrams to various places in Europe and Africa.</p>
<p>(4) China-France route: Direct communication with the French Radio Corporation's radio station in Paris, directly reaching various places in France, and relaying telegrams to various places in Europe and Africa.</p>
<p>(5) China-Russia route: Direct communication with the Soviet Russian Transportation Committee's radio station in Moscow, directly reaching various places throughout Russia.</p>
<p>(6) China-Switzerland route: Direct communication with the Swiss Radio Corporation's radio station in Geneva, directly reaching various places throughout Switzerland.</p>
<p>(7) China-England route: Direct communication with the Royal Traffic Corporation's radio station in London, directly reaching various places throughout England, and relaying telegrams to various countries in Europe and British Africa, India, and Australia.</p>
<p>(8) China-Philippines route: Direct communication with the American Radio Corporation's radio station in Manila, directly reaching various places throughout the Philippines, and relaying telegrams to the Americas and Siam.</p>
<p>(9) China-Vietnam route: Direct communication with the Saigon Vietnam Postal and Telegraph General Bureau's radio station, directly reaching various places throughout Vietnam.</p>
<p>(10) China-Netherlands route: Direct communication with the Dutch East Indies Radio Station in Batavia, directly reaching various places throughout Java, and relaying telegrams to the Netherlands, Australia, India, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>(11) China-Japan route: Direct communication with the Radio Telegraph Company's radio station in Tokyo, directly reaching various places throughout Japan.</p>
<p>(12) Shanghai-Hong Kong route: Direct communication with the Hong Kong Postal General Bureau's radio station.</p>
<p>(13) China-Italy route: Direct communication with Italy's Rome Radio Station, directly reaching various places in Italy.</p>
<p>The author has taken the trouble to list the above circuits and explain the places that can be directly reached because the representatives are living abroad and may not know or fully understand the country's telecommunications business and its circuits. If the information is clarified, we know that the representatives are very concerned about the country and will, after returning, advise Chinese people in all regions that all telegrams sent to the country must have "Via Radio Via Anten" (via International Station) marked in the remarks section at the bottom of each telegram, which is a symbol of love for the country.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the past eight years, all the staff of the International Radio Station have worked hard, and have achieved the highest records in the speed and accuracy of transmitting telegrams. For example, the highest speed for telegrams sent from Shanghai to New York is only four minutes, and the highest speed for telegrams sent from Shanghai to Hong Kong and Manila is only one or two minutes. Furthermore, errors are extremely rare. According to statistics, the total number of incoming and outgoing telegrams at the station in 1933, after complaints from recipients, showed that only 1.27 percent of the errors were due to the station's fault. The International Radio Station operates so efficiently that, through the efforts of the various bureaus and stations to attract customers, the business has grown daily. The number of incoming and outgoing words was 2,922,268 in 1931, increased to 3,650,674 in 1932, and increased to 4,028,460 in 1933. In 1934, due to the opening of the China-England and China-Japan routes, the business showed an even greater surge than in previous years. The number of telegrams reached 50,000 per month, with more than 7 million words, gradually matching the foreign underwater cable companies that have been in business for decades.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the International Radio Station, our country's international communications have been able to restore freedom. In other words, the relationship between overseas Chinese and the motherland has been strengthened and tightened. Today, the motherland is seeking assistance from Chinese people overseas for various construction projects. It is hoped that the overseas representatives will convey the achievements of the International Radio Station's construction to Chinese people in various places so that they understand the content of the station and know what to choose when sending telegrams. If this happens, it will be a great fortune. As for the magnificence of the station's architecture, the novelty of its machinery, and the thoughtfulness of its services, the station will be happy to provide the representatives with a sincere reception if they visit Shanghai and come to see it.</p>

<h3>Supporting the New Currency System</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>Like a thunderclap, the new currency system policy was officially implemented by the Ministry of Finance starting from the 4th of this month! Regarding the implementation of the new currency system policy, its benefits for our nation's economic future and the various reasons for its implementation have already been clearly explained by the financial authorities and economic experts, so this publication need not elaborate further. In short, this policy, if implemented effectively, is the most perfect method for the revival of our nation's economy.</p>
<p>As for our telecommunications sector, we have a few other thoughts regarding the realization of this new policy: Firstly, what we have always felt was inconvenient is that the currency terms were too complex. Not to mention coins, even paper money often had dozens of varieties in one place, making it difficult to remember and distinguish. Sometimes, even though the bank that issued the paper money had already collapsed, the paper money had not disappeared from the market. Sometimes, even though a bank was in operation, doubts arose about the banknotes it issued because the bank was not very well-known. Therefore, the telecommunications bureau and the public often encountered many unnecessary disputes when making payments or collecting telegram fees. As for using coins, many misunderstandings often occurred due to the varying fineness and the mixture of genuine and counterfeit coins. Now that the use of coins has been prohibited, and only the banknotes of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications are stipulated as legal tender, other bank notes are permitted to circulate temporarily, but must be gradually exchanged. In the near future, the various miscellaneous currencies on the market will be eliminated, and only the banknotes of the three major banks will circulate. Disputes between the telecommunications bureau and the public due to currency will inevitably be reduced to a minimum, or even eliminated.</p>
<p>Secondly, in the past, the minting of coins was mostly done freely by the provinces due to their independent governance. As a result, the fineness was low and did not meet the legal standard. For example, the "hao yang" circulating in the Pearl River basin and the "chuan yang" circulating in Sichuan province could not be fully used due to insufficient fineness. The former required a discount when used and could not be valued according to the face value. Moreover, the currency price varied from morning to evening, making it difficult for the telecommunications bureau to convert the "taiyang" to calculate the telegram fee. Sometimes, the price fluctuation was too great within a single day, resulting in considerable losses. The latter could be fully used within Sichuan province, but when exchanged outside the province, a premium of 40% or more was sometimes required, while various telecommunications machinery and materials had to be purchased with full silver dollars. Therefore, the telecommunications business income within Sichuan province was effectively reduced by 40%. These situations had a very large impact on the telecommunications economic policy, enough to hinder the development of the telecommunications industry. Now that legal tender has been implemented, various miscellaneous currencies must be gradually withdrawn, without a doubt. Soon, the currency price across the country will be unified, and there will be no difference in high and low prices. The telecommunications revenue will naturally not suffer this loss again.</p>
<p>Thirdly, in addition, we feel a common difficulty, which is giving change. Because the value of various currencies is not fixed and changes frequently, the telecommunications bureau's business offices must post the silver currency exchange rate daily. At the same time, because the legally defined "li", "fen", and "jiao" decimal fractional currencies have not been officially minted and issued, it is difficult to accurately find and exchange the correct amount. Therefore, there is always some loss on one side between the sender and the telegraph office. Therefore, several telecommunications bureaus, in order to avoid losses for both parties and for the convenience of handling matters, mostly use postage stamps for change. However, once the postage stamps are stained, they are difficult to use. Therefore, this method is not welcomed by every telegrapher. Therefore, the fundamental solution still lies in the rapid minting of legally defined standard fractional currency. It is heard that the financial authorities have ordered the mint to start minting 5-li, 1-fen, 2.5-fen, and 5-fen copper coins, as well as 1-jiao, 2-jiao, and 5-jiao nickel coins, in order to thoroughly implement the new currency system policy. In the future, these legal fractional currencies will be used in the market, and all illegal standard copper and silver miscellaneous currencies currently circulating in the market will be gradually withdrawn. We hope that the Ministry of Finance will implement this method as soon as possible, so that the telecommunications agencies will no longer have to post the silver currency exchange rate, and at the same time reduce all unnecessary troubles.</p>
<p>Therefore, all of us in the telecommunications sector should absolutely support the implementation of the new currency system policy.</p>
<p>(5) Our country's telecommunications policy is currently striving to improve</p>
<p>In recent years, our country's transportation authorities have indeed changed a lot in terms of telecommunications policy. For example, the merger of wireless telecommunications, the joint establishment of telecommunications and postal offices, the installation of new-style Catter telecommunications machines, and other new facilities are all sufficient to increase the speed of telegram transmission and provide the public with full convenience. The reporter deeply believes that as national affairs gradually become stable and various industries develop equally, the social need for telegrams will increase, and telecommunications equipment will become more complete. Conversely, if the people do not need telegrams and the bureau's business cannot develop, then even if the transportation authorities strive to improve, it will be laborious and useless, and will not achieve the goal of benefiting the country and the people.</p>
<p>The world often believes that our country's telegram rates are too high and cannot be popularized among the people. This saying may have some merit. However, after the telegram rates are reduced, the people's desire to send telegrams may still not increase. If income decreases on one hand and telegram business does not increase on the other, then a major financial problem will arise, and it will be even more difficult to sustain. What is currently hoped for is the development of domestic transportation and the advancement of various industries, first creating a dynamic and lively society to increase the driving force for sending telegrams. Secondly, the people's habit of using telegrams must also be gradually cultivated. In this way, with all parties advancing in parallel and taking both facts into account, I believe the transportation authorities will be able to carefully consider the situation, plan comprehensively, and find ways to reduce the telegram rates to seek further popularization.</p>
<p>(5) Hoping for cooperation from all parties</p>
<p>Telegram communication has a great relationship with the country and the people. In foreign countries, whether it is commercially operated or government-run, the people do their best to maintain and supervise it in good faith. The current state of telegrams in our country, in terms of management equipment and machinery, may not be as perfect and sophisticated as in foreign countries, but it has generally taken shape. If given time and a good environment, improving equipment and adding new machines will not be difficult to catch up with foreign countries. Therefore, it is deeply hoped that all sectors of the country will cooperate and assist in good faith. The development of the telegram business can directly promote the advancement of various industries, and indirectly raise the status of the country and the nation. As for facilitating public communication and connecting the feelings of all sectors, its relationship is still considered small.</p>

<h3>The State of Telegrams in Countries Like England and the United States and the Reasons for Their Development (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Li Jiqing</p>
<p>(3) The Reasons for the Development of Telegrams in Countries Like England and the United States</p>
<p>The telegram business in countries like England and the United States is indeed very developed, but there are various reasons why it is so developed. The reporter traveled to various places and observed in detail, and learned that there are many reasons. A few are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Convenient Transportation The transportation in countries like England and the United States is extremely convenient. There are airplanes in the air, trains on land, and ships on the water. In addition, the roads are well-connected in all directions, and cars come and go like weaving. Therefore, the people and all things in society are constantly active day and night. As a result of this activity, the social situation and personal interactions have become unusually complex, and the telegrams that transmit news have increased greatly. Our country has few railways, and even fewer highways. The aviation industry has not yet become widespread, and sea and river transportation is also developing. Therefore, the people in various places have lived in one place for a long time, and rarely travel far unless there is an urgent matter. Life is extremely quiet, and personal interactions tend to be simple. The transmission of news has no time sensitivity, and the need for telegrams is not significant. In recent years, the number of domestic railways has increased, highways have developed, and the degree of social activity has gradually increased. The need for telegrams will inevitably increase. This is indeed a good phenomenon.</p>
<p>(2) Prosperous Industry and Commerce In various places in the United States and England, there are large-scale factories manufacturing various daily necessities. The scope of their commercial operations mostly extends to all parts of the world. With the development of industry and commerce, matters such as promoting sales orders and transportation negotiations must rely on the convenience of telegrams to seek speed and profit. Telegram exchanges have increased as a result, and various telecommunications companies are working day and night to strive for rapid transmission.</p>
<p>(3) People Can Utilize The people of the United States and England are very good at utilizing telegrams. In addition to handling legitimate matters and of course sending telegrams to transmit news, they also make extensive use of telegrams for travel entertainment and ordinary social affairs. When traveling, they send telegrams to inform family and friends of their departure and arrival. For weddings, funerals, and celebrations, they send telegrams to express congratulations and condolences. During festivals, they send telegrams to congratulate each other. In addition, people related to various gatherings and theatrical performances also express their feelings through telegrams. Their use of telegrams can truly be said to be meticulous. Compared to the situation in our country where telegrams are not sent unless there is an important matter, and people feel panicked when they see telegrams, it is a big difference. The fact that people in countries like England and the United States are good at using telegrams is not only because telegram rates are not expensive, but also because they have a habit of sending telegrams. As for their telegram rates, the reporter carefully studied and felt that compared to their monthly salary, it is not cheaper than in our country. Our country's current rate for social telegrams seems extremely low, equivalent to just over one dime in US dollars, and about seven pence in British currency, which is actually similar to the prices in England and the United States.</p>
<p>(4) Simple Characters The development of telegrams in countries like England and the United States owes much to the simplicity of the characters. The characters in countries like England, the United States, Germany, and France all evolved from more than twenty letters. What can be said can be written, and the application is extremely convenient. Moreover, the modern method of transmitting telegrams all uses typewriter-style receiving and sending machines. The telegram is sent on the machine at location A using the typewriter method, and the same telegram is received on the typewriter-style machine at location B, which can be read. Sometimes, the sender can even use this machine to send telegrams themselves and deal directly with the receiver without going through the telegram bureau's agency. It seems that our people cannot enjoy this kind of convenience, because the characters are complex and there are many dialects. The telegram must first be translated into numbers and then translated into the telegram text. Such complicated procedures are inconvenient for both the sender and receiver, and cause various difficulties for the telecommunications bureau. Our country's telecommunications bureau is now equipped with the same new-style telecommunications machines as the telecommunications companies in England and the United States, but because our country's characters are not as simple as theirs, it seems that we cannot achieve the highest effectiveness. The Ministry of Transportation is currently sending personnel to study the Mandarin telegram method. In the future, after its implementation, it will definitely provide great convenience to the public in sending and receiving telegrams. Reading domestic newspapers overseas, I learned that the Ministry of Education is currently promoting the simplified character method, and there is a movement to simplify characters in the country, which is truly gratifying. The slow progress of our country's various undertakings is also greatly caused by the complexity of the characters and dialects. The inability of telegram handling to be sufficiently quick has a significant relationship with this matter.</p>
<p>(5) Our Redundant Official Military Telegrams</p>
<p>The various commercially operated telecommunications companies in the United States and the government-run postal and telecommunications administration in England all charge fees according to regulations for each telegram: half price for official telegrams and full fee for commercial telegrams. There is no situation where sending and receiving a telegram provides an income, but official telegrams are recorded without payment, or only material costs are charged. Official telegrams, whether in plain language or code, are quite concise, with very few empty words. Our country's official military telegrams, on the other hand, often contain parallel prose, polite greetings, or involve private matters. Sometimes they are sent to all parts of the country, widely distributed to unnecessary agencies, and the words "extremely urgent" are added before the telegram, limiting it to "immediate arrival". This kind of situation, added at will by the secretary at a moment of pleasure, causes congestion of the lines, hinders commercial telegrams, and increases procedures for the telecommunications bureau, which is extremely disadvantageous. This is something that telecommunications personnel handling telecommunications affairs in foreign countries would never dream of. If a telecommunications company in England and the United States has telegrams, it has income. With income, it can strive for development. The development of its telecommunications business is based on this reason.</p>
<h3>All Sorts of Misunderstandings Caused by Users Due to Connection</h3>
<p>— Ye Linsheng's Speech</p>
<p>This article is what Mr. Ye spoke at Guangpantai, Wuxian. Regarding users various misunderstandings, said reasonably. This journal is happy to publish it. All people who make use of telephone, please find time to read it, it is hoped! Editor's note</p>
<p>Fellow users, and people who are telephone users: Today I come to report an important piece of telecommunications common sense. That is when you use the telephone at times, and feel that it is inconvenient – especially in moldy weather, in your opinions, maybe you think it is the telephone bureau's operator personnel who gave up on their duties, and makes things difficult for the user. This kind of thing can be said cannot be completely impossible. Also, cannot say the operator must have no fault. However, you must know, the telephone bureau's operators – that is, the connecting personnel – they are under the strict supervision of the leaders and the chiefs at all times. If they deliberately violate regulations and commit other things, they will certainly receive severe punishment, and will definitely not be forgiven. Therefore, the words "deliberately making things difficult for the user," I am afraid that while theory has this, it will not exist in reality. According to statistics, of all the reports regarding user inquiries, eight or nine out of ten originate from misunderstandings on both sides. Therefore, there is a need to explain these misunderstandings. In other words, there is a need to make you users understand the reasons for the misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Now I will report the various obstacles, as well as the reasons why users have misunderstandings, using the method of analysis, to make it clear.</p>
<p>First type The reason why the bureau cannot answer</p>
<p>(1) Two lines are connected or interrupted;</p>
<p>(2) User's telephone has an obstacle, or the bureau's switchboard has a problem, causing the light not to light up.</p>
<p>"Note" Shared-line switchboard, each user has a light.</p>
<p>You must know, when calling a telephone, the bureau does not come to answer, it is no more than these problems, not the operator deliberately ignoring it. You should notify the telephone bureau via a nearby telephone or letter, so that they can send a craftsman to repair it at any time.</p>
<p>Second type The reason for slow response</p>
<p>(1) Shared-line exchange switchboard, each operator manages an average of more than 240 households. There are often more than ten households that want to dial at the same time. Operators cannot answer at the same time. They have to answer in order, so it is inevitable that it will take a little longer to answer the last household!</p>
<p>Third type Wrong number and name</p>
<p>(1) Different accents in different places, the operator mishears. Sounds like 1742 are most easily misheard.</p>
<p>(2) Users do not look at the number book, and the number correction slip that is sent every month. The number reported has already been changed to another house. The operator connects according to the number reported, but the user thinks the connection is wrong.</p>
<p>Fourth type Interrupted call</p>
<p>(1) When the user is speaking, the cord on the switchboard suddenly has a problem, or some street lines are suddenly broken or touched by the wind. In this case, the conversation will of course be interrupted.</p>
<p>Although the user has finished calling the number, but the one who was called has not come, or the person being looked for has not come, it stands to reason that the receiver cannot be hung up. If at this time, one party hangs up the receiver, hanging up the receiver is the signal that the call has ended. The operator sees that the user has already indicated that the call has ended, and will naturally disconnect the user. At this time, the other user who is speaking will definitely suspect that the operator is causing trouble, but who knows that the operator is taking the blame for someone else?</p>
<p>(3) If the user has a sub-machine installed, when the sub-machine is in a call, and the main machine also wants to make a call at the same time, if you are not careful and flip the switch over, then the person speaking on the sub-machine will not be able to hear the end of the conversation. Fifth type The user calls but does not come or answers slowly</p>
<p>(1) The line has an obstacle, the ringing current cannot pass through, and the bell will not ring.</p>
<p>(2) Most users telephones do not have a dedicated person guarding them. Sometimes the owner goes out and locks the door of the telephone room, then even if the bell rings, no one will answer.</p>
<p>Sixth type Various other misunderstandings</p>
<p>(1) During the conversation between the two users, one party occasionally does not answer, mistaking it for the bureau having disconnected the line!</p>
<p>(2) The party being called hears the bell ringing, picks up the receiver without speaking, and at this time suddenly talks and laughs with someone, or someone nearby scolds, and the party wanting the number hears it, thinking that the operator is scolding people.</p>
<p>(3) The party being called has a line obstacle, and the bureau replies "line is bad". At this time, the damaged user has just repaired it, or is blown open by the wind at this time. The party wanting the number learns of it, and is certain to suspect that the operator is causing trouble.</p>
<p>(4) The number that the user wants is often unable to be connected immediately because it is talking with another household. The user thinks that the operator is intentionally perfunctory, unaware that the busier the exchange is, the more users are talking and unable to be connected, not that the operator is intentionally perfunctory. Because each operator connects a line without any effort, if they perfunctorily answer users with words such as "someone is calling" or "the line is busy", the user is bound to ask for the number again. Resulting in having to connect eventually, wouldn't this be more troublesome the more perfunctory it is?</p>
<p>In short: In the future, if there is any inconvenience in connecting, you can notify the telephone bureau separately, and the telephone bureau will definitely accept it sincerely, find out the truth, and give a satisfactory answer. However, before the facts are clear, you must not arbitrarily assume that "this is the operator causing trouble" or "a certain telephone bureau is bad", because before the facts have been clarified and resolved, the conclusion reached is the user's one-sided suspicion and misunderstanding. What is needed between the telephone bureau and the users now is sincere cooperation, and there must be no suspicion and misunderstanding. Once there is a misunderstanding, it will affect the development of the national telecommunications industry!</p>
<h3>Discussing the Standard Writing of Telegrams</h3>
<p>— Wang Hengyun</p>
<p>Regarding the writing method of telegrams, there is originally no limit to the format. The main condition is "clarity". However, if you can write in a more standard way, it will increase the speed of telegrams and help the telecommunications bureau staff a lot. The standard format for writing telegrams is very simple and easy to do. It is a win-win method that is convenient for yourself and suitable for others. I think the people who send telegrams must be very happy to do it.</p>
<p>The text used to send telegrams is divided into two types: one is foreign language telegrams, and the other is Chinese telegrams. For foreign language telegrams, whether in plain code or cipher, as long as they are transcribed clearly, or copied on paper using a typewriter, it can be said to be a very perfect format. Chinese telegrams require more procedures because they must be translated into numbers. Chinese cipher telegrams use four or five numbers as a group, combined according to the cipher book compiled separately by the sender, so they must be translated into numbers and sent by the sender themselves. As for Chinese plain language telegrams, it is stipulated that they must be translated according to the code listed in the newly compiled plain code cipher telegrams published by the Ministry of Transportation, and the meaning of the telegram must be connected into a coherent text. The sender can translate it themselves according to the newly compiled code, or they can just write out the Chinese characters and ask the telegraph office to translate it for them. However, for this kind of self-translated plain code telegram, the original text must be noted next to the code so that the telegraph office's receiving staff can check whether their translation is wrong on behalf of the sender. Because they have the responsibility to correct errors and verify the telegram. Regarding this kind of self-translated plain code telegram, some people think that noting the original telegram text is an extra procedure. In reality, it is not. Because anyway, when sending a telegram, you always have to write out the telegram draft first before you can translate it. Then, write the telegram draft more loosely and translate the code below each character. Wouldn't it be more convenient? And it guarantees that there are absolutely no errors in the translation of this telegram.</p>
<p>For the paper used to write telegrams, the telegraph office has prepared very exquisite and suitable telegram paper, with the telegram format and telegram regulations printed on it. Anyone who sends telegrams can go to various telegraph offices or telegram receiving and sending offices to ask for it, free of charge. If you don't use the paper issued by the telegraph office, you can do whatever you want, but it is best to write horizontally from left to right. This is the custom for writing telegrams. If the telegram is written horizontally from left to right according to this custom, the telegraph office staff can send it out without hesitation, which will greatly increase the speed of your telegram. On the other hand, if the telegram is written from right to left or vertically from top to bottom, then it is not very standard. Although it can still be sent and received in the same way and will not be delayed, the staff cannot help but read it, because this writing method is not the customary order. Therefore, when writing telegrams, write horizontally from left to right. This is the standard way of writing.</p>
<h3>A Guarantee for Sending Money Order Telegrams</h3>
<p>— Baozhen</p>
<p>Banks established by countries or private individuals in Europe and America, in order to prevent evil people from using the name to send fake telegrams with the intention of deceiving money for profit, mostly agree on a secret code check word or check number in advance. The bank sending the telegram writes it before the text of the money order telegram. After receiving the telegram, the bank receiving the telegram must verify the secret code check word or check number used before the incoming telegram to avoid being counterfeited and defrauded of money. This method is very good. The international telegram rules also stipulate that "bank telegrams and similar telegrams, if the text contains a secret code check word or check number, are still considered plain language telegrams." Our country's telegraph office has always allowed the use of secret code check words or check numbers for foreign language plain language telegrams sent by domestic or foreign banks. However, there is no such stipulation for Chinese plain language telegrams. It was not until August of the 23rd year that the various telegraph offices received an order from the Ministry of Transportation stipulating that, starting from September 1st of the 23rd year, the text of Chinese plain language money order telegrams sent by banks or money changers should also be allowed to use a secret code check word and an Arabic numeral indicating the date and number of the telegram at the beginning or end to prevent counterfeiting. All of these check words, numbers, and other words in the text will still be charged according to the Chinese plain language telegram rates. It is heard that this stipulation has already been published in the current domestic telegram business rules and is used as a fixed rule.</p>
<p>The majority of those who send money order telegrams are banks or money changers, but other merchants who have commercial money exchanges with merchants in other places also often need to use telegrams for quick remittance. For example, "Hankou Minsheng Road Yapu Electric Company – Pay Chang Zhuang (500) yuan, Central Bank (7200) yuan, Main Factory Foundry", its nature is no different from a money order telegram. Regarding the large amount of money in and out, it is also especially necessary to add the above-mentioned secret code check word. It is learned that the Ministry of Transportation has also allowed various merchants to send Chinese plain language telegrams for the purpose of remittance to follow the example of bank and money changer telegrams and use a secret code check word and an Arabic numeral indicating the date and number of the telegram at the beginning or end of the text. From now on, various merchants can get a reliable guarantee when sending money order telegrams. As for money order telegrams sent by individuals, the sender and receiver can agree on a word in advance to be used as the sender's signature, and its function can be comparable to a secret code check word. The telegraph office has no restrictions on the word used for the sender's signature, and the sender can choose any word.</p>
<p>Next, regarding the writing method of secret code check words and date numbers, I will briefly describe it as follows. According to the regulations in Section 3 of Article 20 of Chapter 6 of the International Telegraph Rules and Section G of Article 6 of the Foreign Language Telegram Writing and Charging Method, the number of letters or numbers contained in the check word or check number in a foreign language plain language telegram is limited to a maximum of five. As for the secret code check word in a Chinese plain language telegram, it is limited to four codes, such as (9717). Also, according to the regulations in Section B of Article 54 of the current domestic telegram business rules, the above-mentioned check word and date number must be written in parentheses (the parentheses symbol is free of charge) and a "number" character must be added after each. However, if there are no other characters or numbers in between, only one "number" character needs to be added after the second parenthesis, such as (9717)(1601) number. Therefore, it is not appropriate to write this series of check words and date numbers separately. If they are written consecutively at the beginning or end of the text, one "number" character can be saved, reducing one character's telegram fee. (End)</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Ministry of Communications' Telegraph and Telephone Machine Repair and Manufacturing Facility</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>—High-Quality Products, Low Prices—</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications' Telegraph and Telephone Machine Repair and Manufacturing Facility is the only institution established by the Ministry of Communications to manufacture telegraph and telephone machinery. It is also the only factory in the country that supplies telecommunications machinery. Although its scale and equipment are not particularly grand compared to other machine industries in the country, due to the rapid advancement of internal management and manufacturing technology, its products not only serve the needs of the agencies under the Ministry of Communications, but also telegraph machinery needed by various important railways in the country are vying to order from it. Recently, the reporter had the opportunity to visit the entire factory and dares to briefly describe it to introduce it to readers:</p>
<p>We know that the manufacturing of a piece of machinery involves complex work such as drafting, carpentry, casting, forging, fitting, turning, assembly, and testing. The manufacturing process within the repair and manufacturing facility, except for a portion of the casting work which is contracted out to local foundries, is all handled by the facility itself. What we saw included manufacturing workshops, electroplating workshops, paint spraying workshops, and bakelite workshops. The manufacturing workshop includes (1) carpentry room, (2) fitting room, (3) lathe room, (4) planing room, (5) drilling room, (6) broaching room, (7) milling room, (8) hardening room, and (9) assembly room. The workers were all busily working. The sound of the machinery was deafening, demonstrating the intensity of the work.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Lin Dongchen, an engineer at the facility, "Although our facility is an affiliated institution of the Ministry of Communications, it is economically self-sufficient. The Ministry of Communications only provided the initial establishment funds! After several years of concerted effort by all personnel, we have now achieved a considerable foundation. However, the facility's funds are still limited, and everything still requires the maintenance and expansion by the authorities. The facility's staff are all graduates from well-known domestic universities and specialized schools in mechanical engineering. Although the compensation is extremely meager due to the facility's funding constraints, their ability to endure hardship and perform tasks is outstanding, which deserves our praise. The facility's management of workers focuses on skill and moral training, ensuring that every worker has good character and excellent skills. The facility has basketball court facilities to provide workers with physical training. Every evening, workers also receive two hours of classes, instructed by the facility's staff. Workers are naturally greatly helped in the facility's production under such good cultivation. In terms of the facility's business over the past two years, the Ministry of Communications is naturally our largest customer, but now a significant portion of the telegraph machinery used by major railways is also supplied by our facility. Although the facility's machinery has increased significantly over the past few years, it is still felt to be insufficient due to business expansion. We are actively expanding to meet actual needs. Mr. Shu Zhendong, the facility's manager, is the inventor of the Shu Shi Chinese typewriter at the Commercial Press. He has a deep foundation and strong interest in machinery. Therefore, although Mr. Shu also serves as the director of the Capital Telephone Bureau and is very busy with official duties, he makes sure to come to the repair and manufacturing facility every afternoon to personally supervise. The facility's current position is naturally due to the assistance provided by Manager Shu.”</p>
<p>The reporter was extremely satisfied after listening to the above remarks from Engineer Lin and visiting the internal workshops of the repair and manufacturing facility. It is urgent to record this to substantiate this publication.</p>

<p>Discussion</p>
<h3>What is Hoped for in Chinese Women</h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>A-jing telegram: On the 8th, the masses requested the A-huang to reward three women in the Heberley River Basin who assisted their husbands in resisting the Italian army. Two of them crawled for an hour under Italian artillery fire to supply ammunition to the frontline machine gun team, only retreating when ammunition was exhausted. The third woman commanded five soldiers to tenaciously defend the outpost trenches and ensure the safe retreat of the five soldiers.</p>
<p>Women occupy a very important position in today's society. Social work requires women's efforts, political work requires women's participation, and even military work requires women's assistance. This is undeniable in the current extraordinary era.</p>
<p>But what is the situation of women in our country in retrospect? The vast majority of old-fashioned women, needless to say, have become prisoners of feudal forces. Furthermore, they have neither the fortune to receive education nor the opportunity to participate in social work. To say that these women abandon their responsibility to society is more like society rejecting their contributions. As for a portion of new-era women, although they have been influenced by Western ideas, some are willing to be playthings for men, while others still regard being a virtuous wife and good mother as their highest goal. There are also many people who want to drive them back into the kitchen. There are also a few women who claim to be enlightened, but they only focus on fighting for equal rights between men and women. It is very rare to see those who demand to dedicate themselves to society and fulfill their obligations to society.</p>
<p>The new era has already arrived before our eyes, which is an opportunity for women to develop their abilities. Women in A country have already assisted men in resisting the enemy. The environment our country is currently in can be considered extremely difficult. It is hoped that Chinese women in general can also take on a share of the responsibility for saving the country.</p>
<h3>The Disappointed Crowd</h3>
<p>— Lin Hao</p>
<p>This is a street that can only accommodate two people walking side by side. Outside the street is the pier of Changxing Rice Firm. Open boats from the countryside are moored there haphazardly. The boats are filled with new rice, and the weight is too much, pressing the hulls very low, almost half buried in the water, rooted, without even a ripple. Three or five boatmen squat on the bow or stern, chatting about heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Changxing Rice Firm is on that side of the street. The morning sunlight is faint and weak, shining there, precisely illuminating several big men wearing tattered felt hats, dressed in ragged clothes, and with faces sunburnt to a purplish-brown color. They had just rushed up from the pier, not even catching their breath: "Sir, how's the market?"</p>
<p>"Coarse rice is five and a half, grain is three and a half." Wearing a pair of tortoiseshell glasses, looking very important, he said haughtily, this, it is said, is the accountant of Changxing Rice Firm.</p>
<p>"What?" [Unclear text]</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>cold water, they were surprised. Where did the fiery hope of just now go? Ah! Did it grow wings and fly away? Not believing it, they only felt their own eyes blurring, stopping for so long: "I remember selling it for eleven and a half in June this year, you..."</p>
<p>"June is June, now is now, don't talk nonsense. Why don't you say you bought it for fourteen that year, let alone eleven and a half."</p>
<p>"Oh!..." Feeling that there was nothing to say: "But, sir, how can it fall so fast?"</p>
<p>"That's strange enough. Don't you think about what year it is? People don't even have spare money for food, who can afford to sell it expensive? Besides, rice from everywhere is flooding in like a tide. Judging by the current situation, humph! It will fall even lower in a few days!"</p>
<p>"Then,... sir, please raise the price a bit?" The one wearing the felt hat pleaded.</p>
<p>"Tch!" Not good, the gentleman smiled coldly, with more to say: "Raise the price? Then we'd have to work for nothing. Such a big rice firm, so many employees, everyone would starve to death!"</p>
<p>"Sir, can you save us farmers? Raise it a bit, we're so pitiful!"</p>
<p>"Sir, please have some kindness! The price is really too pitifully low, please add some?"</p>
<p>"The same as last year, eight yuan and two? We'll just have to ask you to earn a little less, sir..."</p>
<p>"Look, how long-winded these people are," the accountant said to another gentleman, pointing his finger at this group wearing felt hats, then turning his head back: "If none of you think the price is high enough, then don't sell it! You have goods and we have money, we don't interfere with each other, what's the point of being long-winded? Aren't there two more boats coming over there?" Pointing to the pier, showing off extremely, turning his head with the tortoiseshell glasses away.</p>
<p>Everyone was like a lamb to be slaughtered, privately turning to the stone steps to discuss:</p>
<p>"I think we should row to Liu Village?"</p>
<p>"That's not right, it's said that they've had a meeting among themselves, I'm afraid they won't go up or down?"</p>
<p>"Hmph... Do you believe their lies?"</p>
<p>"It's not worth mentioning a meeting among themselves, but rowing there would add another expense for the boat, and it would be the same as Changxing, then we'd be really out of luck! Let's not go to Liu Village!"</p>
<p>"Don't sell it, turn back and take it home!" The indignant one said heavily.</p>
<p>"Hmph! We won't necessarily die if we don't sell it." The gentleman turned his head: "What are those foreign ocean ships bringing in? Really... Tch..." Another cold laugh.</p>
<p>Fiery hope, Changxing Rice Firm, eleven and a half, eight and two, five and a half, foreign ocean ships... Everything seemed to give them a jolt.</p>
<p>The ones who had just docked came again, three or five dark-skinned guys wearing tattered felt hats.</p>
<p>"Ask them, what's the price?"</p>
<p>"Coarse rice is five and a half, grain is three and a half." The gentleman said the same thing.</p>
<p>The fiery hope was shattered, like soap bubbles, another three or five burst.</p>
<p>The first ones looked at the later ones, the later ones looked at the first ones, everyone's stomach felt infinitely empty, and their minds were filled with disappointment. Their eyes shot down to the stone steps, silent like dead water in an ancient well, never to ripple again.</p>
<p>Everyone had a helpless look on their faces.</p>
<p>Thus, the transaction was completed in helplessness. Although they were unwilling to send those snow-white rice grains into Changxing Rice Firm, they needed snow-white silver dollars even more. What they regretted was exchanging those large bags of rice for a small number of silver dollars, and those were green and patterned paper bills:</p>
<p>"Sir, can you exchange them for Yuan Shikai's?"</p>
<p>"Paper money can also be exchanged for things, how stupid! You country bumpkin!"</p>
<p>"Then, please give us the Bank of China's?"</p>
<p>"Hmph! You don't even want the very strong and unbroken Central Bank, do you want... you're preparing to sit on the...?" The gentleman flared up, slapping the counter. He said proudly. The one wearing the felt hat had nothing to say, hanging his head, and went back dejectedly.</p>
<p>In this way, the fervent hopes they had before arriving at this street were destroyed: the wife's fancy clothes, the children's toys, and everything needed... Now, there was nothing left. What they got was not even enough to pay the landlord. They had worked hard for a year in vain. They felt that the world was collapsing, and they felt infinite pain!</p>
<p>The sun reached the top of the head, illuminating this group of disappointed people, gradually moving to the other side of the pier.</p>
<h3>Night Inn</h3>
<p>— Tian</p>
<p>Four or five points of light scattered in the grass huts surrounded by the mountains, mixed with the flickering fireflies, poured out the lonely night moon, clear as a mirror, from the depths of the valley in the eastern mountains.</p>
<p>The lonely night moon slowly stepped onto the lush treetops, and people on a long journey also hurried. A staggering heart did not shorten the length of the road, and the eerie terror of the clustered ridges appeared after the daytime difficulties. Pulling the steps tighter, thousands of pounds of weight tripped the calves.</p>
<p>—Inn! Inn! Is it so vague!</p>
<p>Fine stones pricked the heart of the feet like needles, and the thick floating skin also felt excruciating pain. The rugged mountain road, like the rugged life, was a hazy shadow, turning from wide and sloping to a narrow path. The lights of the distant village also disappeared, only the fireflies danced brilliantly, and a new moon shone indifferently in a narrow sky.</p>
<p>His feet were not on the ground, and his heart trembled at the tips of every star. The muscles all over his body shrunk the area they occupied, moving his eyes to the pebble road in front of his feet, and moving his heart to all the details of socializing after he arrived in the ancient city of Chang'an. He wanted to grab work, he had to socialize, walking, walking, but linking socializing and money, he couldn't help but think about the loss of the daytime.</p>
<p>Walking, walking, his mind and body were entirely focused on the daytime matter:</p>
<p>Detective! Grabbed! Slapped twice! Detained for two hours! Fined ten dollars! What to do with only five dollars left!</p>
<p>Cold sweat oozed onto his forehead, was it fear or annoyance? Even he himself didn't know. Following the soft, half-withered thorns, he walked slowly. Occasionally looking up, that gloomy pass flashed behind him, but the fierce,不可這視 evil state still startled him.</p>
<p>Finally, he fell from the crevice between the two peaks onto a flat plain locked by night fog. The lights flickered like blinking fireflies, sparsely scattered in the corners, like children seeing strangers. He also looked around like children seeing strangers. His muscles suddenly relaxed, joyfully like dried-up fish leaping into the sea.</p>
<p>—If there's no inn, I'll have to spend the night by the base of the wall.</p>
<p>Looking towards the place where there was light, the sound of footsteps from the terraced fields reverberated in the deep valley of the opposite mountain. The sound waves immediately became hollow and clear. The sensitive barking of dogs echoed the rhythm of his footsteps. He switched the long bag, which weighed only three or four kilograms but felt like thousands of kilograms, to his left shoulder, breathing out all the pent-up air in his chest.</p>
<p>"Inn for Business Travelers" A long sign, vaguely recognizable under the moonlight, a bamboo-framed pergola, shielding the frost of October, the middle-aged and weak him, only felt a little warmer here. A hall-filled kerosene lamp burned three red torches, and he sat down on that bench with peeling patterns.</p>
<p>The night inn was strangely lonely. Besides an old couple in their fifties or so, there was no one else. The fire in the stove had also gone out. The old man opened his bleary eyes and asked tentatively:</p>
<p>"Guest, are you still rushing on after resting for a while?"</p>
<p>"It's late, I want to stay here, is there a place?"</p>
<p>The old man was a little afraid and a little happy: "There is a place, but..."</p>
<p>The old man didn't finish his sentence, but he didn't pursue it either. Seeing the situation, the old couple were reliable. His stomach rumbled, so:</p>
<p>"Please cook some supper for me, I'm hungry."</p>
<p>The old woman cooked, the old man fetched water to wash his feet. He opened his package, took out his shoes and socks, and tied the only twenty-odd silver dollars to his waist.</p>
<p>After eating dinner, the old man led him to a room with three beds lined up, and told him:</p>
<p>"Be careful! This place was robbed three nights ago, it's a pity they even took our tattered clothes and junk!" The old man still had some lingering fear.</p>
<p>"Is that so?—Three nights ago?"</p>
<p>"Yes—be careful, there's a small door here, if there's any movement at the front door, you can escape from here."</p>
<p>After the old man left, only a little kerosene lamp was left. Besides the bed he was sleeping on, the other two beds didn't even have quilts. Dust and cobwebs adorned the four walls, and some black marks remained on the ten walls.</p>
<p>He dared not sleep, but he had to. Yes, this place was deep in the mountains and forests, it should be easy for bandits to come! What to do? The muscles all over his body ached so much that he couldn't move forward even an inch. He used his package as a pillow, put his hands on the money bag around his waist, anxiously, lingeringly, drowsily fell asleep...</p>
<p>Who was it that grabbed his right arm and threw him from the bed to the ground.</p>
<p>He was bewildered. When did they open the door, when did they sneak into the room where he was sleeping, what happened to that old couple, he didn't know at all. Half of his left body trembled with a burst of numbness before he opened his eyes.</p>
<p>"Where's the money? Take it out quickly!" The face of that big man was covered with a thin layer of coal smoke, but his true face could still be recognized. It was those people who claimed to be inspectors during the day, all five or six of them, with several sabers waving shimmeringly on the ground.</p>
<p>"Masters, I don't have any money. Didn't I give it all to you this morning?"</p>
<p>Peng! A slap landed on the old wound, in exactly the same way.</p>
<p>"Where did you give it to us? Nonsense!" Pulling him up, the silver dollars clattered to the ground. "Don't resist!"</p>
<p>In his desperate struggle, the silver money bag was finally untied by them. He howled and cried: "Innkeeper, help! Help!"</p>
<h3>Returning Bird</h3>
<p>— Xiao Qi</p>
<p>Like a gray pigeon accustomed to wandering, ah, the heart of a traveler, wandering under the vast sky, trekking on a long journey, feels exceptionally tired.</p>
<p>I flew from the north to the south like a pigeon, but three years only brought me back a chest full of disappointment and aged sighs, and lost the brocade dreams of youth, the brocade of longing. Yes, three years is very short, but I have become another person, as if a defeated straggler retreated from the front line, the vigorous, heroic enthusiasm completely died out, only a broken body and mind remained. I threw myself back into my hometown, my hometown still had lush fruit trees, clear rivers, lovely orange skies, and gentle monsoon winds, gentle sunshine, and gentle air. All the charming scenery. However, I had no interest in appreciating it. My heart was simply a stagnant pond, heavy and silent, unable to stir up even a ripple. With that stagnant pond of a heart, dragging my slow steps, I vaguely trampled the ground of my hometown, in the fields, between the bamboo garden fences, in front of the tomb inscriptions. I could almost remember that I had sat on that stone bed, on that lawn, leisurely browsing the color and illusionary posture of the sunset on the distant suburban mountains, while listening to the cowherd riding on the back of the animal, singing a loud, unrhymed mountain song. I would almost be drunk, unaware of the approaching dusk. Now, I pass by every stone bed, every pile of lawn where I once sat in a daze, and I feel nothing, only knowing that I have lost a joyful heart. And those clusters of bamboo gardens have also become desolate ruins. Looking at the vast fields, it is all a white expanse of water, with only a few wild geese swimming back and forth.</p>
<p>Three years, yes, very short, why did everything change all of a sudden?</p>
<p>My own home, on the walls outside the house, two of the three pomegranate trees had died, and the one that survived seemed so lonely. The stamens bloomed as usual, and the fruits bore as usual, but the old and gentle grandmother who had personally planted the pomegranate trees had been in her grave for two years. The father who loved to eat pomegranate fruit, for the sake of the family's livelihood, went to a distant and foreign land, and still often did not forget to instruct in his letters to cultivate it well, and not let it wither. The pomegranate is a symbol of happiness! These words were also the grandmother's dying words. The sound of the old grandmother telling stories has disappeared, and the talkative voice of the father has been separated, so the home seems very lonely. And my return is accompanied by endless sighs.</p>
<p>Yes, three years, very short, but not only I have changed, even the face of my hometown has become so desolate.</p>
<p>Thinking that my hometown could finally let this tired returning bird rest, but the whole situation is like this, my breathing becomes more and more rapid, I can only flap my weak wings and fly out again!</p>

<p>The beautiful and unparalleled Xiaoxiang concubine. Listening to the parrot recite poetry, my heart wants to break. The golden wind blows down the autumn parasol leaves. Her thin and delicate body feels the chill of evening. Stop embroidering. Close the gauze window. After bathing, she tidies her remaining makeup in the boudoir. Lightly applies screw shell black to paint the green of spring mountains. Lightly applies rouge and musk fragrance. With jade hairpins, she loosely combs her greasy cloud-like hair. Sheds her red shirt, revealing fragrant skin. Standing silently on the jade steps. Lightly holds a fan against the setting sun. The golden crow gradually sinks in the western mountains. The moon rises over the tips of flowers, reflecting the silver wall. Turning and twisting, she pities her beautiful shadow. Softly calls for Snow Goose to light the silver lamp. Ziju, the maidservant, asks the young lady. Why do you often sigh and weep? Her heart is full of secrets that no one understands. That's why she's so thin and her beauty fades. Helplessly, the water clock drips slowly. Loosely takes off her silk robe and goes to bed. Hears the rain hitting the banana leaves and wetting the crabapple blossoms.</p>

<h3>Afternotes</h3>
<p>The organizer of the Shanghai Yanyan Society is Miss Ma Li's fiancé. When the Shanghai Yanyan Society broadcasts on the mainland, the two of them always go in and out together, very affectionate.</p>
<p>It is rumored that Yang Ping has left the Shanghai Yanyan Society and formed another ×× Society, which will begin broadcasting on XHHS soon. Is this true? (Above by Xiao Si)</p>
<p>Miss Zhang Suzhi, the director of the Mingmei Troupe, went to Ningbo with the Peilei Dance Troupe on October 31 to perform. It is reported that the violinist Zhang Yingjun was also with them, and they will return to Shanghai in a few days.</p>
<p>The Qingxin Nightingale Art Society has now stopped broadcasting. Miss Liying always likes to rush to report for others, but she never sees it through.</p>
<p>Miss Wenxian of the Greater Shanghai Society made six or seven phone calls one evening around 10 p.m.</p>
<p>Miss Liu Ling said, "When I see people playing football, I'm really a little scared, so I always lower my head and avoid them from a distance."</p>
<p>Miss Yang Chunmei has received almost a letter every day these past few days. (Above by Meng Ying)</p>
<p>Movies</p>
<h3>"Beauty's Heart" Opens in Paris</h3>
<p>The Xiafei Road Paris Theater will premiere the martial arts star Fan Pengke's "Beauty's Heart" today. The film tells the story of an eccentric in 19th-century Spain named "Don Juan" who loves women and chases after butterflies. Young girls and middle-aged women are all fascinated by him. This romantic affair is still widely discussed today. The props in the film imitate Spanish colors and are worth seeing.</p>
<h3>"All-Star Gala" at the Great Light</h3>
<p>The long-awaited Paramount musical blockbuster "All-Star Gala" (The Big Broadcast of 1936) premiered at the Great Light yesterday. It is said that the funds Paramount spent on producing this film are enough to produce ten more blockbusters, which shows its greatness. In terms of talent, not only did all of the company's musical stars and comedy stars join in, but also many stars from the American music and broadcasting industries were recruited. The producers also gathered musical styles from all over the world for the production of this film. As a result, new types of musicals are abundant, beauties of the era are as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, unique jokes emerge one after another, and exquisite backgrounds are dazzling. Everything is unprecedented, and everything is original. Among them, there is a scene of elephants dancing, which is especially amazing. These giant elephants were collected from circuses and had already received considerable training. Then, they were taught various dance styles in various ways. Their performance on stage with the dance troupe can be described as lifelike, which is truly commendable.</p>
<h3>Silver Jottings</h3>
<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>Gogol's "The Government Inspector" caused a sensation when it was performed by amateur actors at the Jincheng Grand Theater the other day; it is now reported that Mr. Klovsky has adapted it into a movie script, which will be produced by the Soviet Ukrainian Film Company starting this spring.</p>
<p>After Mr. Klovsky's adaptation, in addition to the difference in time when performing (the original play took three and a half hours to perform, and the amateur actors in Shanghai even performed it for four hours, while the adaptation into a movie is scheduled to only take eighty minutes), the scenes and actions that could not be expressed on the stage have also been added, and a critical and analytical spirit has also been added to the era when "The Government Inspector" was produced.</p>
<p>It is said that after Tolstoy's famous work "Resurrection" was adapted into a stage play by Donner, the Dentong colleagues will start rehearsing it from today.</p>
<p>It is said that Yihua Company spent hundreds of thousands of dollars, but unfortunately it has come to a miserable situation now because it was too suspicious of employing people. Today they listen to what A says, and tomorrow they change their minds and listen to what B says. As a result, the company's colleagues all have the mentality of "five days as the capital magistrate" and live a life of eating tofu, because they can't get anything else to eat.</p>
<h3>"School for Wives" to be Staged</h3>
<p>Ding Wanlaitian, the director of the Oriental Theater Company, and Jinshan, since they jointly performed Gogol's "The Government Inspector" with amateur actors and won general acclaim, are now directing the members of the Oriental Theater Company to rehearse Molière's famous work "School for Wives." These past few days, they have been assigning actors and urging them to familiarize themselves with the script. They will start rehearsing immediately, and they plan to rehearse it to maturity in a month. With Ding Wanlaitian's directing experience and Jinshan's acting achievements, this time directing "School for Wives" will definitely be a success. Around the tenth of next month, we can enjoy this perfect play again.</p>
<h3>The balloon dance accompaniment in "All-Star Spotlight" is the most famous women's music team.</h3>
