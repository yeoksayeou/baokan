<h3 id="c23">為辦理「信用小借欵」者進一解 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— 彥</p>
<p>最近通易信託公司發表其辦理整借零還小額借欵第一年之統計。其分析結果之昭示於我人者。不特薪水階級之困難可見。卽一般社會之經濟狀况亦可略窺其一二。査我國金融機關之開辦此項借欵者當以上海銀行爲最早近年先後繼起者。除上海通易而外。尙有新華。中國通商。上海　。上海信托。寗波實業。中級信用經濟信用合作。社四明儲蓄會等多家。假定每家放欵餘額爲十萬元合計約爲一百數十萬元。借戶數目約有萬戶。而全年放欵總額當在二三百萬元之譜。借戶總數亦在二三萬戶之間若依此推算。其影饗於國民經濟者似非淺鮮。</p>
<p>今之辦理信用小借欵其借欵。數目大抵以五百元爲最高額。期限以一年爲最長。利息月息七厘半至八厘。一律預扣。借欵人並須覓妥保二人。以負担保資任。此後分期還本。每月一次若按年金現價公式計算。借欵人之實付利息。當在一分五厘以上。其負擔亦不可謂不輕。因之非難之者。認爲不無重利盤剝之嫌。而一般悲觀論者更以爲足長奢風。無裨實益。蓋自另一方面觀察小借欵之借戶。無異以其月薪收入之一部。請求予以貼現耳。</p>
<p>惟以我人觀察。信用小借欵之能應一般社會的需要。殆無疑義。而今後之成效如何。則在辦理此項業務者應如何發揮其作用。借欵用途之不正當不必需者。應設法予以防阻。借戶之分期償還。應若何以養成其守信不渝之習慣。因之放欵之先。應有周詳之調査紀錄。而已放之後。借戶之管理。亦須有嚴密之注意。現在辦理未久。尙不脫試騐時期。完備之統計分析。更所必須。固不必因其效果欠佳。而諱莫如深也。</p>
<p>抑信用小借欵之辦理。雖似利益優厚。實則手續旣繁。成本亦復較高。若以此爲金融機關對社會服務之一端。當無不可。如目之爲資金之出路。則恐事實之困難。未必稍遜於其他。以我人愚見。信用小借欵之辦理。當以社會服務爲原則。不應侔利爲前提。故基金必須另撥。會計亦宜獨立。在可能範圍之內。利率更有稍减之必要。至其借戶之對象。似應以小工廠小商店爲歸依。卽有個人放欵。亦當嚴加限制。以免增加社會之靡費。而失調劑社會金融之本旨。至工商業信用借欵。則又爲另一事件。當於另篇更論之。</p>

<p>— （長春通訊）</p>
<p>日蘇兩國、爲了中東路的買賣問題、用了一年又九個月工夫、往復磋商、經過了無數的波折、現在算是正式簽字成交了、而且、第一期欵二千三百三十萬日金、於簽字之日卽照收了、其餘的欵項、規定分期交付、中東路上的蘇籍重要職員大都準備移交、他們的眷屬已先期回國、該路蘇籍人員爲數約七千、第一批日方派去接收的人就有五千、現在雖然說祇要肯安心工作、對所謂「滿洲」又沒有妨碍的、就可以繼續下去、而實際上恐怕很難容許其存在、不但赤籍路員大多數難於再留、卽普通的蘇籍商人合計三萬五千餘、也有不少要收拾行裝回國、蘇聯在北滿的勢力雖未必從此消滅、至少她再不能操縱北滿經濟實權、今後將處於被動地位、松花江與嫩江的圍繞地域、是最富庶的地方、其可耕地約計八千七百二十二萬海克脫、現已開墾的不過其中百分之二十、僅一千七八百萬海克脫、這一帶地方是中東路最大的財源、也就是北滿最主要的地區、出產方面、單就農業產品而論、大豆約占百分之三十六、小米占百分之二十、髙粱占百分之十五、小麥占百分之十二、玉蜀黍占百分之七、總之東三省特產品、北滿方面當占一大部分、大小興安嶺雖未開發、又是不適宜於耕種地帶、但那邊有亙古未開發的樹海、所占地積至少有十九萬以至二十萬平方公里、木材積量逾一千萬萬立方呎、樹木的種別、有朝鮮松·蝦夷松·樅樹·落葉松等針葉類、山梨·菩提樹·白楊·棉·靑剛·白樺等闊葉樹、現在砍伐的、多半是靠近吉林方面、和傍近中東路的地方、不過占森林總面積的十分之一、</p>
<p>牧畜也十分有利、中東有關各地、羊馬等合計有九百萬頭、牧畜的中心地域是呼倫貝爾一帶、羊毛的質量是很好、正在發達的日本製毛業、特別需要這一帶的羊毛、現在牲畜皮毛的交易中心是齊齊哈爾·海拉爾·滿洲里、輸出則多半向海參威集中、中東路旣歸日本掌握、這類有世界性的物品、東部方面會向清津出口、西部則將爲大連所吸收、</p>

<p>中國文化建設協會主辦之全國讀書運動大會、昨爲第三日特請商務總理王雲五演講讀書的方法、明日（十一日）下午三時一刻起該會特請學術界名宿蔡孑民在中西電臺請怎樣研究哲學、茲錄王雲五演講讀書方法全文如次、</p>
<p>讀書方法　今天承文化建投協會邀我講演讀書的方法、關於這個問題、學者主張頗不一致、有些雨讀書要有興趣、便沒有讀不成的、用不着什麼方法、又有些人說、讀書沒有方法彷彿航海沒有羅盤、祇在茫茫大海中飄流、不能達到目的地、我以爲兩說都有道理、而且興趣與方法是相輔的、不是相反的、因爲有了興趣、自然而然能找出相當的方法、有了方法也就不難引起興趣、不過究竟從方法開始或從興趣開始、那一樣較爲便當、値得研究一下、我以爲如從興趣開始、第一問題便是怎樣、</p>
<p>鼓起興趣　第二便是鼓起興趣後、需要多少時候、才能找出相當方法、至於從方法開始、那就簡單得多、祇要有人指導相當方法、照着做去、不久便會發生興趣、興趣一來、或者還可以找出更好方法、現在舉一切身的例子、我在少年時、因受環境的剌激、又不甘伏於那環境之下、因此便感覺讀書的興趣、但是那時我絕對不知道讀書的方法、自己亂摸亂摻、雖然讀了不少書、都走了很多寃枉路、再具體些說、許多朋友都知道我在三十年前、曾經做過一件極笨的事、就是把整部的大英百科全書從頭至尾的念了一遍、一部大英百科全書、內有多少學科、其性質相差多遠、一個人把他讀了一遍、究竟有怎樣好處、不但未必多能了解、縱使都能了解記憶、也不過對於一般的知識廣博一點而已、假使能利用同樣時間和精神、循着</p>
<p>適當程序　專讀一類的書、其成就不知要增多幾倍、而且我因爲開始便做了道樣一件笨事、後來二十幾年間、所讀的書雖很多、不過把百科全書推廣一點而巳、所以讀了二三十年的書、簡直沒有一點專長、直至最近幾年、才發見自己錯誤、專向一二件事研究、假使能够早了十年發見、恐怕還能多成就一點呢、總之、我對於讀書發生興趣在三十年前、而找出讀書方法、乃在最近幾年、我因爲自己吃過這種虧、所以極力奉勸諸位在開始讀書時便要注重方法、現在巨說</p>
<p>我的主張　的讀書方法、我以爲做學問好像造房子、先要奠基然後開始建築、所謂學問的基礎、無疑地便是文宇和各種普通學科的知識、假定以相當於現在初中畢業的程度爲準則、在這基礎之上便可以開始學問上的建築、換句話說便可以開始有規律系統的硏究、具體些說、便可以就自已所好、飽讀一科目的書、但如何能鼓起讀書的與趣、和養成將來不斷讀書的習慣呢、我以爲最好不過是一開首便擇定一個中心問題、寫一本有系統的書稿、或是一篇有系統的論文、這種書稿或論文、並不是要印刷發表、作爲個人讀書的一種淸賬、從前讀書人主張做剳記、這固然是很好的方法、但剳記的性質是雜亂的、其組織是散漫的、雖可帮助記憶練習作文、却不能養成、</p>
<p>研究習慣　和興趣、反之如能擇定一個中心題目、寫篇有系統的論文、那讀書旣有目的、自然而然的翻着有關係的圖書雜誌、去搜羅材料、如果得着相當的材料、正如淘沙得金、其快樂可想而知、如果得不着相當材料、正如飢思食渴思飲、其慾望之濃厚、又可想而知、本來各大學的高年生所做畢業論文、其意議便是如此、可惜國內各大池對於此事不很注意錄過敷衍門面、所以效力不大、我常常以為不獨大學生應該以十倍精神、各人寫一本研究深切的畢業論文、就是髙中學生也應該各人寫一本至少五萬字的畢業論文、甚至初中學生也應寫一本二三萬字的畢業論文、因爲做這樣的論文、一來須多讀書、二來可練習文字、三來可以組織思想、硏究專鬥學的人、周然可發揮專門的問題、就是普通學生也可就淺近問題搜羅資料、從事</p>
<p>系統敘述　現在我可奉勸不在學校硏究的人、如有心續書、最好也隨意擇一個中心題目、這些中心題目、大的係世界大事國家政治、次的係哲學問題、科學原理、小的像北京的鴨子、近的像上海的城隍廟、都可以作爲研究的題目、尤其是題目愈小愈能引起讀書的興趣、不過在開始研究的時候、最好請一位有研究的人、把研究的程序、和應該搜集的材料、大略給他指導、經過了相當的研究、便自然自動找尋材料了、現在文化建設恊會請了許多專家替有志讀書的靑年選定了當讀的書、譬如替各位奠定了學問的基礎、如何從這基礎上開始建築、要靠各位自己的選擇和計劃、我奉勸各位最好能各自預定一種題目、本着這個題目、第一步向指定的書本中求資料、各位對於所讀的書本定發有興趣、同時如有餘力、自然會向其他書本中進求問題的資料、這樣諸位對於所進修的學術上的建築便因興趣濃厚、可以早日完成、完了、</p>

<p>（一）黎君以爲注音即係識字之符號猶之句讀標點、此種比擬、似不甚切當、蓋句讀標點以形式言之、不外乎一點一綫、非若注音符號之波　紛紜變化繁多、以數量言之、每句或每一小句方始一用、並非每字之旁均附加以位置、言句贖標點通常均安置在文字之下面、並不附屬在文宇之緊旁、所以句讀標點、與文字顯然有別、而注意符號與文字、必致混淆、至閱讀時、同時觀看兩種符號、文字與注音符號—多費時間、是不容分辯、</p>
<p>（二）據本人調査日本報紙情形、其注假名者、十字中不過一二、非若黎君所主張每個漢字皆附注昔符號者可比、又云、日本報紙雖六號字亦注假名、然所謂六號字者、决非供兒童閱讀、如兒童讀物及敎科書亦一律如此、吾恐黎君亦不能保證其不至於都成近禮眼也、</p>
<p>（三）注意只能集中一點、此係心理學家所公認、注音符號及漢字並列、閱讀時如只看漢字、注香符號等於無用、如兩種同時並看、同時注意、則費時·擾亂·錯誤·各種危害一齊發生、在敎學過程中、影響甚大、</p>
<p>（四）推行之前、先從事研究、黎君亦認爲需要、然國內不乏設備完全之大學及富有學騐之專家、儘可用適當計劃、作實際研究、如不先事實騐、貿貿然以全國千萬兒童作試騐品、其代價未免太大、</p>

<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>張伯苓先生說：「救國的第一點，在購用國貨」。國貨的關係國家命脈，是大家公認的。張先生自華北來，眼見華北日貨的充斥，精神上受到無限的痛苦，所以勸人購用國貨，爲救國的第一點，如果不能服用國貨，還配談救國，配幹救國工作嗎？可是華北是如此，目下南方的情形，也是一天不像一天了。學生國貨年，自從開幕以後。沒有聲息了，提倡國貨的聲浪，也像春眠似的靜下來了各國貨工廠，日宛轉於行莊的冷酷面目之下，也掙扎得聲嘶力竭了。一方面日商的活躍，倒是偸偸摸摸，似扒手一般挿身進來了。本報九日載日商來華活動消息；大阪的日本製造廠塲及各大商號，爲謀發展對華貿易推銷日貨起見，聯合五金，機械，電料，文具，萬年筆，圖書材料，喞筒發動，雜貨，油紙，化妝，防水具，自動車，蓄音器，鑛業商等二十六家製造商，聯袂來華赴上海南京長江一帶考察，旨在視察中國需要何種貨物，卽行準備日貨來華推銷以故日淸公司長江輪之停駛者，現已次第復航，大有恢復一二八以前的盛况。這　消息，我不知提倡國貨的人士看到了感動否？他們是考察的考察，會議的會議，偸偸摸摸，得寸進寸的進攻了，我們還是只知自私自利糊裏糊塗，半痴半聾的不問不聞，究竟什麽用意，什麽心肝呢？</p>
<h3 id="c202">國貨與科工救國 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 悲秋</p>
<p>十幾年前，麻雀牌裏的「春夏秋冬這四枝花好像被取消了，一倒下牌來總是「挽回利權」或「振興實業」。那時候的報紙天天可以看得到這八個宇，人們的嘴上也常常談着這八個字，人們的信裏也封封都有這八個字。這八個字眞風行一時，在當時差不多比現在的「摩登」兩個字還要來得摩登呢！</p>
<p>直到現在—以婦女國貨年來說罷，我覺得人心大變了，人是愛用洋貨，信裏愛寫洋字，什麼巴黎香水呀，什麽外國花粉呀，什麽……呀，什麽什麽呀，這一切都有驚人的入超的數目呢！</p>
<p>於是吳稚暉先生大聲疾呼起來：「科工救國！」這意思是說，我們的科工能够和外國一樣的發達，使中國人可以自巳用自已的東西，不必依賴洋貨，那末中國可以得救了。然則，科工眞的能够救國嗎？我們看，電的運用在中國已經很發達了，如電氣摩面，電氣燙髮，電刑等等，誰能够說，這是爲的救國呢！這只是電的浪費而已啊！</p>
<p>自然，電的正當的用也是有的，比如電扇，它能够改變氣候，它是對人類有很大有供獻。而且刻着　這個商標的電風扇，已經風行全世界，它到過印度，到過菲洲，也到過南洋羣島，它的確替中國的民族工業界爭得一顆曙光了，同時它也已經盡了救國的義務了。</p>
<p>這樣一比較，結論比較明顯了，發達科工不一定能够救國，但是發達科工的確是可以救國的，這就是要看發達怎樣的科工了。如果發達一種與人類無益的科工這是不能救國的，如果發達像華生電扇那樣的與人類有益的科工那就能够救國了。</p>
<p>不過，事又不盡善。要是華生電扇的種類沒有這麽多——搖頭交，流檯風扇，木葉交流吊風扇，交流打氣扇，火車風扇等：要是華生電扇沒有這許多優點——每小時僅用電七十五瓦特（十六寸搖頭檯風扇），而每分鐘可轉一千二百五十餘轉，開至最久時間又無燒壞之弊，同時取價又要便宜；電是沒有以上這兩個條件，外國的電扇一定會取而代之，决不會讓它的足跡踏遍全球了。</p>
<p>所以在「科工救國」這個口號下面，我們應該注意到，必須發達於人類有益的科工，而且必須發達到使外貨沒法競爭的科工，像這樣的科工才配得起稱「科工救國」或稱救國的科工」哩！</p>
<h3 id="c203">怎樣使「學生國貨年」發出大的力量來？ <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>今年是『學生國貨年』！誰都已經知道。可是，要怎樣纔能毅使這個『學生國貨年』，發出大的力量來？却少有人論及。現在我不揣愚陋，對這個問題，提出來談談。</p>
<p>（一）在家庭方面　我以爲『學生』在家庭方面，所居的地位，就是『子女』。訓導子女的，就是父母。這時師長之　，所不能及的。那麼，做父母的，便該明白了這一點，自己的子女，在學校內横豎『學生』，如今旣然是『學生國貨年』，便該處處『以身作則』，訓導其子女們服用『國貨』。</p>
<p>（二）在學校方面　子女在學校裏，就是『學生』。訓導學生的就是師長。自然，這時在做父母的，也管不到的了。換句話說，就是做父母的，這時已把訓導其子女的責任，完全諉之於做師長的了。那麼，做師長的，更應該明白了這一點，今年旣是『學生國貨年』，自己旣居於訓導學生的地位，便該處處『以身作則』，訓導其學生們服用『國貨』。</p>
<p>我想，如果做父母的，和做師長的，大家眞能分別認淸自己的責任，依照上面的辦法，來共同努力，時時刻刻互相訓導，時時刻刻互相督率的話。那麼，這個『學生國貨年』，纔會發出大的力量來—其理由，也有下面的二條。</p>
<p>（一）這樣，可以使學生們對於『國貨』，在腦海裏有了深切的印象，不致一轉身便忘却，然後可以逐漸地把信仰『洋貨』的見解，轉移到『國貨』上面去，永遠的服用『國貨』。</p>
<p>（二）須知『學生國貨年』，不過是一個國貨運動的『年號』，服用『國貨』的責任，初非僅僅是屬諾學生。實際上的意義，依然是需要各界人士努力的。如果，如上所述的訓導的辦法，做父母的能彀眞正『以身作則』，訓導其子女服用『國貨』，那麽，便可以達到各界人士都努力的地步。因爲，學生的父母，未必都是學界中人，農工商皆有的　個個能彀『以身作則』，便是個個能設服用『國貨』。這力量豈不更大嗎？唉！總而言之，願大家努力啊！</p>
<h3 id="c204">値得介紹的敎育玩具 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 金水</p>
<p>兒童，是整個國家的未來的主人翁，也就是組織民族的最重要的基礎份子，所以各國對於兒童的敎育，都極端重視，越是强盛的國家，兒童敎育，越是辦得完美，不像我國一般人隨隨便便的對待兒童，以爲兒童的舉動，本來無足重輕，甚至認爲讀書寫字，以及其他一切的訓練，也無非是『小和尙念經，有口無心』的勾當，所以一向不去糾正他，總以為到了自己需要的時候，便會奮勉上進，這種見解，眞是大錯特錯，我們應該明白，兒童自小任其放縱，便會『習慣成自然』，卽使到了相當的年齡？也不容易改變過來，俗謂『三歲意思到老』，就是這個道理。</p>
<p>現在，我國對兒童敎育，也漸漸地重視了，吶喊了多時的『兒童年』，終於在政府領導之下，將在本年八月初開幕了，這當然是全國小朋友們所樂聞的一個福音，不過，我們知道，凡是定一個什麼年，必有什麽年的任務，兒童年所負的使命和任務，那當然是要替全國兒童謀幸福，在兒童們是要改進本身的生活，革除一切不良的習慣，造成全國兒童都爲未來的完人。</p>
<p>要完成這個『兒童年』的使命。自然祇有從敎育方面入手，可是，兒童的敎育，除了書本以外，還是要靠着遊嬉來輔助，因爲兒童的生活，多數是遊嬉的，那麽，應該從遊嬉中去指導兒童，從遊嬉中去敎育兒童，這樣，就需要適當的『玩具』了。</p>
<p>玩具，在兒童敎育上，旣然佔了這樣重要的地位，所以適合敎育的玩具，便應運而生，這裏，記者要介紹一家專製敎育玩具的工廠，——中國敎育玩具廠——他們的出品，處處都適合兒童敎育的目的，能够直接或間接影響到兒童的情感，思想，品性，以及智識，技能各方面的訓練，現在把談廠的各種出品分類錄下，以供敎育界或家長的採擇。</p>
<p>（一）交通類汽車，電車，火車，等</p>
<p>（二）軍器類·唐克車·鐵甲車，飛機，小鋼炮等。</p>
<p>（三）動物類　雙鷄喫米，雙舞鴨，海豹等。</p>
<p>（四）樂器類銅鼓，喇叭，搖鼓，嚮鈴等。</p>
<p>（五）用具類菜具，香籃，鉛桶，票夾等。</p>
<p>以上所列，雖祗寥寥數類，但已包括一切，件件適合兒童心理，不拘男的女的，都能引起興趣，啟發智慧，且花鐵構造，堅牢耐玩，於衛生，安全，經濟，又樣樣顧到，這不是記者過分替他宣傳，實因物質優美，思想精密，有功於兒童敎育，的確値得介紹。</p>
<p>去年六個月當中，外國玩具進口總數，二十九萬二千一百九十五金單位，折合國幣達五十七萬七千九百六十二元，如今有了這樣優美的國貨玩具，或許可以减少一些漏巵，這是記者所熱烈盼望的。</p>

<p>今年上海金融界議决之新猷，是（一）不做洋米押匯（二）對於採辦洋貨商號，其中尤以銷售奢侈品之商號不予信用貸欵，此眞金融業之覺悟也。</p>

<p>吾友王楚聲君，在上海錢業月報第十五卷第三號上，著「金融業之新猷」一文，頗多警切之語，其言曰「近年來進口貨多，出口貨少，於是僅爲單方面之工作，卽爲進口商支付貨欵，而不能爲出口商吸收外資，金融界處此種畸形狀態之下，等於燕巢危幕，其何能久，卽放欵雖爲行莊業務之一，而審察取舍之權，操之行莊，今安可唯利是趨，而與進口商人以便利，使之助長外人經濟侵略，我雖不殺伯仁，伯仁由我而死，王君又作兩希望（一）凡採辦洋貨之商號，槪不放欵不問其銷售奢侈品與否（二）銀行業與錢業立於同一陣綫，作同一步趨，則採辦洋貨之商人，縱欲代外人推銷貨物，其力亦僅云云，語誠精當。</p>
<p>筆者處國貨產業界地位的一份子，急切希望我國貨界共同擁護金融業新猷，相與携手邁進！而爲我國貨前途，關一新生機，尤望金融業諸公，坐而言者起而行也。</p>

<p>— 綠濱</p>
<p>—永利化學工業公司經理—</p>
<p>九一八國難以後，實業部曾經擬有計劃，創辦一大規模的製造肥田粉的硫酸亞廠，以資發展國家實業，抵制外貨，减少漏巵。當時因爲中國經濟短絀，沒有那麼大的資本興辦，就預備和英，德，兩國合辦，利用他們的資本，發展我們本國的營業。曾經請過英德兩國專家會同我國工業專家設計，陳調甫先生也是其中之一人。後來英德兩國，毫無誠意，他們以爲假如帮助中國發展此種事業，將使他們外貨在中國的銷路受影響，因而想從中操縱把持，想把這種事業抓在他們手裏，不讓中國有主權。其宿意侵略，可想而知。因之陳調甫先生認爲國營事業，絕不能操諸外人之手。果如此，豈不是更予外人進一步的侵略嗎？所以就商請實業部獨自創辦，實業部以財政困難，就商請陳先生所辦的永利化學工業公司辦理。陳先生就設法和上海銀行界商洽，又得到銀行界贊同，於是决定用本國資本，在長江北岸的六合縣和浦口當中的卸甲甸地方，設立一個硫酸亞製造廠。現在已經籌備就緒，正在積極進行中，不久就可開工。</p>
<p>陳先生在國內國貨實業界是享有盛名的人，他爲着工廠裏的工人敎育問題前天到無錫，訪問敎育學院院長髙踐四先生，談怎樣在廠內辦理勞工敎育，乘便的登壇演講，我們乃得一瞻豐采，聽到他講些重要的關於永利化學工業公司的情形。</p>
<p>陳先生說，他在天津塘沽辦的鹼廠，已經十多年了。製造純鹼，（炭酸鈉）燒鹼，（苛性鈵）潔鹼，（重炭酸鈉）三種。凡製造麵包，油條，造紙，眼鏡，染色等都要用鹼的，單是國內的銷耗，數目就很大。從前都是購自英國帝國化學工業公司，每年損失甚多。他們的製鹼公司成立之後，便抵制了英國貨物。國內所用的鹼料都是他們的出品。不僅銷售於國內市塲，並且運銷日本，日本對於製鹼工業，尙不及中國。計算每年可以挽回利權達五百萬元。</p>
<p>他又說，他辦理這種工業的目的，不是爲的本身私利，乃是着眼於國家實業，爲國貨界效力，以期發展國內民族資本的工業的。他說他們的製鹼公司所有出品，在世界有了地位，是中國國貨界的光榮，不是個人的光榮，要是以個人利益爲前提去創辦事業實在沒有多大的意義。這幾句話說得透澈極了！我們中國國貨事業的所以不能發展，都是因爲眼光短淺，不能大處着眼，只圖個人私利的。</p>
<p>他又說，製造國貨，必須利用國內原料，譬如製造硫酸亞的原料，最重要的是硫黃，根據他考察的結果，硫黃產量以湖南最多，所以他也計劃過如何去開發湖南硫黃礦。</p>
<p>最後他講到他們永利化學工業公司除去已有製鹼公司和正在進行中的硫酸亞廠以外，還要辦理錏廠，製造亞糜利亞：酸廠，製造硫酸，硝酸。因爲製造許多貨物對於這些原料的需要數量都很多。若不積極自辦，金錢日日外流，長此以往，將永無挽救的時候了。</p>

<p>— （程珍如）</p>
<p>蠶蛾性淫，自從鑽出繭子，就振翅找尋異性，怱忽交尾產卵，雄的交過尾就先死了，雌的產卵後，也就自斃。你看它成蛾後一二十小時的短短壽命，好像祇為性交產卵。</p>
<p>人生百年，不也是一剎那嗎？不趁這一剎那的寳貴時間，努力幹些轟轟烈烈，福國利民的事業，專事「螽斯衍慶」「瓜蠶綿綿」的勾當，坐待鳴呼哀哉，這種人生意義，等於一架生殖機器，和淫性的蠶蛾，又有什麽兩樣？</p>
<p>話雖這般說了，宇宙之大，能有幾人，逃得出這樣蠶蛾式的生活呢？</p>
<h3 id="c209">鰣話 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>被那蘇東坡所憎為「多骨」的鰣魚，現在已經上市了，鰣魚以富春江上所產者為最佳。這，人盡知之，似乎可不必多說；惟富春江上的鰣魚，何以能豔傳人口，名震遐邇，則中間尙有一段小小的軼聞在，茲述之如下：</p>
<p>鰣魚本係海族，惟每年春間，它們必到淡水江裏，優游多時，據說，其最大的目的是產卵。所以，一到春江水暖之際，它們都厭棄老家；似乎過不慣那海上生活的，一定要遷地為良，游向江中去棲息了。</p>
<p>錢塘江裏有個　子門—俗稱　子門—兩旁山峯夾峙，潮水到了那裏，因受着阻力，有磯碕薄湧之觀，所以那處是八月觀潮最佳的所在。鱗魚到了　子門，大槪因乏力，或者因愛那裏潮水激湧，於是便伏在江中產卵，完成它們傳種的任務。</p>
<p>任務旣畢，它們便溯江而上。到得富春江裏，它們正在優哉游哉，得其所哉之時，不料就有一輩喜快朶頤之徒，因那些母　產後乏力，易於捕捉，便伺隙而待，而刀俎之上，遂平添一應時鮮貨了。此時捉到的鰣魚，味最鮮，値亦最昻，非窮措大所能問津的。如果它們僥倖漏網，得逆水而上，復再順流而回，被人捉住，其肉已老，便不為人所珍視了。</p>
<p>以上是一位富陽朋友所述，因記之。</p>

<p>生長在舊家庭裏的人們，身體大都不免近於文弱的。</p>
<p>一年來，我在寫回去的家信中，總是勸我的哥哥和姊姊注重運動，鍜鍊身體。——</p>
<p>也許這些話積久就會打動了他們的心，最近接到我的妹姊的來信，伊說伊們己經預備佈置一個家庭網球塲了。</p>
<p>聽說伊們要實行健身，我心裏覺得十分地歡喜；不過我知道故鄉的運動器具是劣而且貴的，於是我便費了半日的時間，給伊們選購了四個網拍，一個球網，兩打球，交郵政寄回。</p>
<p>同時我在附寄給伊們的信中，除過把球塲的設置，練習的方法，大略陳述了一些意見外，還給伊們寫道：「……有了康健的身體，才能有活潑的精神。……康健眞是無價之寳喲！為了它，你不要吝惜一些時間喲！……」</p>
<p>的確，在一切的運動中，網球的趣味是比較濃厚的；並且它對於腕力，足力，視力，以及全身各部，都有了平均的發育。從前在學校裏的時候，我就是一個「網球迷」；但是如今為了職務上的煩忙，玩它的機會却很少了。雖然現在故鄉家庭中有了新的球塲，然而自己遠在他鄉，心裏不免有一些兒悵然呢！</p>

<p>— 游絲</p>
<p>去歲號稱婦女國貨年，最初亦曾煊赫一時，如時表演也，布衣運動也，開會游行，撰文演講，提倡國貨之聲，甚囂塵上。曾幾何時，蟬曳殘聲，競上別枝，淡焉如雲烟之過眼了，無迹象可尋。惟於歲尾總結算時，赫然可從外貨入超之統計表上，發規舶來化妝品奢侈品消耗於中國婦女者之絕鉅數字而已。似國貨之終於不振，我國婦女亦與有力焉，未免辜負此婦女國貨年之美名。今則一年容易。已更名為學生國貨年，將見本歲提倡國貨之事，業已責有攸歸，但希望少年英俊之學生特別努力，愈可與酷嗜摩登之婦女界無涉矣。此誠令人扼腕太息不無杞憂者也！</p>
<p>入春以來，滬上各大綢莊，為抵制外貨之傾銷政策，竭力杜塞漏卮，挽回利權起見，均抱薄利主義，廉價出售。果也，國人之眼光與心理，皆大為轉移，一時綢緞業頗蓬勃有生氣，為近年罕見之好現象。第迴顧以前國內商業之凋殘，經濟之窘乏，生絲價値之慘跌，以及絲廠之式微，織綢廠之外强中乾，懲前毖後，創鉅痛深，瞻望前途，荊棘尙多，固猶有未許樂觀者在，培養元氣，共維國本，正有待於吾人之努力奮鬥也。頃聞本埠南京路老九章綢緞局有鑒於此，並念婦女界對於國產綢緞實有極密切之關係，故最近擬於該局日內將出版之特刋中，向婦女界作普遍之徵文，不論文藝創作，均甚歡迎，其目的尤在徵詢女界對於服用國產絲織品之意見，俾克測騐心理，有所遵循，使級緞出品，精益求精，達到盡美盡善人人樂用之目的，一經刊出。當酌贈精美絲織品，以答雅意，預料此書出版後，必可為中國綢緞業放一異彩也。（聞該刋現時正在徵文期中。甚望女界同志不吝珠玉。投贈宏文。以收集思廣益他山攻錯之效。惟為洞察婦女界之眞正意見計。最好附惠本人照片一幀云）。</p>

<p>— （吉雲）</p>
<p>法人珊羅鳩氏是法國實騐外科學研究所所長，有返老還童的秘法，名滿歐美。最近挾着他二十一歲的夫人，到日本作新婚旅行。住在帝國飯店裏，每天五十圓的房間，開了三個，舉動豪奢，於是日人十分注意他了。</p>
<p>博士家很富有，夫婦二人住在意法交界的哥利姆台城裏，家中養着許多猩猩人猿，以供研究。夏天住在鄉下，冬天移到巴黎，有五輛車子，供搬塲之用。博士今年已六十五歲，髮雖微白，望之仍若壯年。以年齡而論，他美妙年輕的夫人，只能做他的孫女兒呢。據博士對人說返老還童的方法，猶如在味澀的柿樹上接了甜柿的椏枝以後，就能生甜的柿子一樣。把猩猩或人猿的睪丸，植在人的身上，就可返老，惟方法殊無接樹的簡單罷了。有一個記者問他夫人已施過手術沒有。博士答伊年僅二十一，倘施手術將不能生育。</p>
<p>博士自稱返老回童的手術，自身亦未嘗試。但曾為他的胞弟，用過手術，確已返老十年，大約每十年可以施用手術一次云。</p>

<p>記得在我最初隨着太后去的那一次上，太后也會細細地給我講論過一番。　　「說來也許會使你詫異的！我們每做一雙鞋子，自打樣起始，一直到全部完工，至少必須費一個月的工夫」。太后首先向我說道：「這眞是一件很費事的工程，其中委實有不少的手續呢！便是這些女孩子們，你也不能太小看了！伊們的技術都是極精到的，外面的工人，那裏想比得上伊們！……最先，伊們總得在白紙上晝出一個鞋樣來：晝鞋樣是一伴很費心思的工程，必須面面顧到。諸如鞋料式樣，花紋等等……，無一不須妥加考盧和配置，以期適當；而其中尤以鞋跟的高度，應該最先决定……」。</p>
<p>接着，伊就和我專論鞋跟。—這裏所謂鞋跟，乃是專指當初滿洲的婦女所穿的高跟履。（這種高跟履通俗喚做旗鞋。它們的式樣也和中土的婦女所穿的　鞋差不多，只是頭不尖，且在鞋底下面裝着一截木跟而已。可是這截木跟的位置，却不在後面的跟上，而在足底的中部；人穿着這種高跟履走路，眞像踏着一付低型的高蹺一樣，別有一種流動的姿態。）—這種鞋跟的高度，是必須和上面的鞋底的厚薄，和鞋子的式樣互相呼應的；某種的鞋底，必須配某種尺寸高的木跟，那是不能不仔細研究的，否則穿的人就會感覺到不舒服，甚至會感到痛苦。（二九〇）</p>

<p>— 伍奐冰</p>
<p>星期日下午，散値適四句鐘。給環境所重壓着滯鈍得失去了靑年人應有的興奮的心田，接受了一下暖和的陽光的洗禮，居然也有些躍躍欲活了。拖着鉛一般的脚步，漫無目的地向前行進。不知不覺這兒已是老西鬥了。每一家店門口，都吹吹打打，人行道上來往的人羣熙熙攘攘，好一派昇平氣象。</p>
<p>我方才站定，一輛市公用局最新添備的專駛龍華綫，油漆得光亮可愛的公共汽車停下了。一大批的人從車肚中吐出來，手裏大半是捧着一束桃花，花瓣給碰撞得悉悉率率地弔下來；多麽殘忍，我想。又是一大批人裝上了車。我招呼兩個年紀更輕的同伴說：「我們橫竪沒有事做，也去頑一遭吧！」</p>
<p>汽車平穩地駛行在馬路上，石子路上，煤屑路上；經過了高昌廟，南洋中學，小木橋。一路是鄕野的風景，黃澄澄的油菜花多可愛，一條小溪，在面前蜿蜒曲折，不知一直通到那裏。隔溪是一幅絕妙的春之　闈？「一枝楊柳一枝桃，」古人的　句是最切合不通的。在密層層的桃柳後面，聳立着一座玲瓏實塔，可惜已是日久荒頹，卻愈見得古色古　。</p>
<p>龍華到了，目的地到了，大家下車。果然，遊客很多，有背着黃布袋虔誠進香的老太太，有遊山玩景的摩登先生和女士們，有成羣結隊慣會淘氣的小學生，也有一些在無聊中希冀着找求些許靈感上快慰的人物。走進古剎的正山門，香燭灘上兜售着生意經。大殿前，一位不知姓名的居士，正在指手劃脚的宣講經義，善男信女圍聽者甚衆。大雄寳殿上的三世佛正在裝金，羅漢殿上五百尊偉岸的塑像，莊嚴，肅穆，令人油然起敬。</p>
<p>大殿前後左右的房屋，已修蓋過，雖然都很簡陋，但已一改往昔的頽敗零落之觀了。我們巡禮一週，便卽退出。</p>
<p>出了廟門，一路經過火車站，到飛機塲沒有多遠。這曠野的一片大地，正當薄暮時候，我一路走，一路幻想着頭頂上軋軋的飛機聲，我們勇敢的將士，嫻熟地駕着輕便的戰鬥機，一行列齊整地飛行着，高唱着「還我光榮的河山」，慷慨激昂的凱歌。</p>
<p>南黃浦的風景多美麗，點點帆牆在移動着，我們三個人的影子佇立在灘頭，聽風中江潮的衝激聲，心絃上彈起了無限蒼茫之思，夜幕已四合了！</p>

<p>志前想着，作媒也不是救火一般的事，何以這兩個女人，一來一去，都是在大雨裏面，拚命的掙扎，這裏面不能沒有問題。反正下雨的天，也不能和朋友有什麽接洽，這次一定要伏在窗子邊，看個水落石出。他如此想着，就在屋子裏行坐也不離開玻璃窗戶。果然的，又不到半點鐘，有三個婦女來了。前面是胡嫂子和先去的那個婦人，共着一把傘。後面就是朱月英小姑娘，自己撑了一把傘。胡嫂子走着路，口裏還不斷的說話，隔了玻璃，那話音聽不淸楚。可是看到月英隨在後面，也不斷的應聲。似乎在指揮着他，要作一件什麼事呢。志前想着，在斜風細雨裏忽怱忙忙的接洽，一定把月英帶了來為止，莫不是有人要帶了他離開西安。不過西安這地方，無論到什麽地方去，都是陸路，一下了雨，轎子汽車騾子，全不能走，何必忙？除此之外，還有什麽忙的必要呢？志前旣是想不開這個理，就也不肯放鬆，立刻由屋子裏跑出來，在走廊下站着。他們在院子裏。順了鋪的磚路，繞了屋角走，也是剛剛走過來。（一七九）</p>

<h3 id="c233">偶然想到渥波羅摩夫 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>總聽說渥波羅摩夫是寫一個可譏嘲的人物，但在閱讀時，簡直看不出作者是想把渥波羅摩夫寫成可笑的人物。似乎眞相反，作者借歐爾嘉的口最後稱贊他是世界上最純潔最良善的人，確是很正經地說的。誠然貢覺洛夫是贊成歐西主義的人，他覺得舊式的俄國生活不能再維持，他替歐西主義唱了凱歌，而替渥波羅摩夫敲了喪鐘·但死亡似不是可嘲笑的，因之作者筆下也流不下嘲笑的氣味來。作者似乎很樂觀，並不担心有人或仍繼續着渥波羅摩夫的生活，本來那樣的人也不能做堅抱住已消失的過去的唐吉訶德的，他們隨過去消失得泯然無跡，或者正因其消失得這樣慘淡，倒使人也隨之黯然，而其純潔與善良，成爲誠不無可以懷念之處。</p>
<p>如果渥波羅摩夫不是剛遇家庭的衰落，不是僅剩下一些田產，而是仍能做着大地主，在莊園裏仗着好的管家，遇着安靜的生活，他將是他主中的最好的人物。可是他雖在那樣的環境中長成，却不能安然繼續下去，他只能把少數的田產，托人經理，自己投到不熟悉的社會去。他所委託的人欺騙他，他所最初交接的人也欺騙他，他的僕人和他一樣不通世故，而鼓勵他維持老式的生活。這樣的環境的不能鼓勵他的進取是無疑問的，所以他最多也只是保持他的單純。</p>
<p>他認識歐爾嘉已經太遲了，而且歐爾嘉也是和他一樣單純的人，她沒有改造他的生活的能力。在戀愛中無寗說是渥波羅摩夫支配了她，因爲她是深爲他的性格所成動而愛他的。作者所寫成的在戀愛中的渥波羅摩夫確極可愛，也許這就是貢覺洛夫所以被契訶夫譏爲庸俗的地方，作者是充分用寫理想的羅曼司的方法在寫着。然而我們如不預覺得渥波羅摩夫應該寫成什麽樣子，則渥波羅摩夫在羅曼司中，所扮的角色也並不壞。他並未隱起弱點勉强做英雄，他的弱點便他的戀愛終於失敗，他肯單純地想這是自己的弱點應有的結果，他承認爲歐爾嘉的幸福，他是應該被拋棄的。這樣，一切弱點，就仍完足了他的可愛處。</p>
<p>以他能爲歐爾嘉所愛的地方，爲房東所愛，自然無足奇怪。因爲這是比較庸俗的羅曼司，所以結果結婚，平凡地直到他死。這結束似沒有改動渥波羅摩夫的性格，那末在這點他並不是特別可非難的。我這裏自然不是要力說他的優點，因而原諒他的疲憊，我僅想說貢覺洛夫旣盡力寫他的優點，則其所想給我們的印象或並不和我所聽到的全同吧！</p>
<h3 id="c234">武昌初瞥 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 小默</p>
<p>當武昌剛代替南昌走好運的當兒，我便跑到武昌來，才在小客棧住了一兩天，武昌便給我一個下馬威—那就是悶熱。</p>
<p>關於武漢的酷熱的「野乘」早已聽說過。怎樣一在日斜後便沒有一絲兒風，怎樣黑夜裏在大街上滿攤着半裸的窮人，有錢人怎樣通宵不能寐只好包一輛洋車在街上跑到天亮，靠在車上打盹。</p>
<p>這時才不過是仲春時節吧。來時南京的楊柳　沒有綻芽，這裏的楊柳已長着盈寸的新綠了。到白畫風便定了，熱得怪膩人的，恍惚是初夏的天氣，街上的行人多已換上夾衣或單衣，我穿着羢的衣服在街上走了一會便覺得一頭汗，我雖然生長在南國，而且也走過世界上最熱的地方，祖由這這回乾熱的滋味的初試，我對于將來夏季武昌的生活不得不存戒心了。</p>
<p>武昌與漢口—東方的芝加哥，誠然只隔一江，但這盈盈一水已足以使武昌在許多方面留在中古城市的隊裏了。像南方的舊的大城市那樣，武昌的街道，除了幾處馬路外盡是用白石舖的，但是在道髙低不平的狹窄的石道上新近已走着新式的汽車了。遠遠開着汽取喇叭蠻的時候，行人便連忙走避站在路旁，向汽車行「注目禮，」待汽車走過後才向前走。新式的房子雖也有幾所，但老式的房子是支配着，那骯髒的白灰的牆，那黑色的　腫的大門，和裏頭黝藍灑金的屛門，　　着那中世的黑暗和頽落。還有那門楣上的作龍形矢矯的黑色飾物，也許就是門第髙下之　徵，除了少數臨馬路的舖子外，商店的貨架櫃台等都是方式的陳設，裏頭黑沈沈的有陰森氣，而且除了洋貨店外都終日靜悄悄的，一到了上燈時候，有一兩條繁盛的街已見點着霓虹燈，但城的大部分—特別是住宅所在的地域—却藏在幽暗和靜寂裏，只有一些手工業的作坊還在煤油燈下做着夜工，一些小雜店半掩着鬥露出那可似的燈光。不久，打更的竹柝音也作了，陰沈冷寂的中世意味由是完成。</p>
<p>武昌的風景自是不惡，珞珈山，東湖，南湖等地還沒有去，現在不敢輕作品評，但郊外的十里嫩黃的菜花，抱冰公園的曲折雅麗，已値得人欣賞。不過著名的黃鶴樓却有點惡俗。登石級到蛇山的尾端，抬頭便看見一座灰色像敎堂鐘樓的建築，面前的匾額却寫着黃鶴樓古跡，實在出人意料之外。再前走幾步便是奧略樓，倒有點氣勢，周圍却滿是照相館和相命　，後者的數目且還多一些。照相本是嶄新　玩藝，但到中國便與周公文王，麻衣柳　之　爲伍了。現在武昌已變成中國政治的重心，同時也就是功名逐鹿的主要陣地，黃鶴樓的哲學家們的生意當蒸蒸日上吧。我進呂祖閣的時候正有人在作法事，一個靑年的婦人跪在神像前閉着眼，雙手捧着一紙黃疏，一個道婆和幾個道士正在持着法器喃喃的念經。殿角有一個龕奉着臥着的呂祖，演那黃梁夢的故事。在龕旁是一個門口，垂着布　，牆上貼着「機房重地閒人免進」幾字，掀　一看，原來是一個電報房。現代的交通却侵入了神權統治着的地盤了，又是一個滑稽的矛盾呵！</p>
<p>然而不管矛盾不矛盾，神秘不神秘，武昌的確是在走着好運了，只要看街上掛着證意的人驟多起來，包車的叮噹聲音格外嚮得起勁，房子的租條隨粘隨扯，飯館新開的也有好幾間，便可知道了。呵！武昌是走上繁榮之路了，爲甚麽繁榮起來，別的地方又怎樣，這些問題，自有別的人解答了，恕不再寫下去。</p>

<h3 id="c236">新近的感想 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 魏中天</p>
<p>雖然近半年來比較有一個好的環境同好的心情來用功讀點書，可是，仍覺得這些日子過得有點惋惜似的！早上起來，看見太陽從東邊的窗口裏射進來，似乎只是一閃，一天的光陰又完了，又看見晚霞從西方的窗口裏出現，我帶着惋情的心情看着晚霞往暮靄裏躱，像希望那麽容易地消逝了。</p>
<p>書，雖然也讀了不少，然而，我認爲一個人的智識若是全靠書本上得來，那是有限中的有限，一個靑年人，整天伴着一枝筆同一堆書躱在房間裏，我總認爲不是一件幸福的事，智識，應當是從廣大　衆中的生活上得來，才是豐富的，深刻的，朋友，你以爲是不是？</p>
<p>在這麽好的陽光同好的風當中，我總戚覺得尙有一件比讀書更有意義的事情在等着我去做，等着我去體騐，然而，我只恨我自己缺少那副勇氣了。</p>
<p>過去，一切希望，，一切夢，都被生活的魔鬼吞噬得乾乾掙凈，到今天，重新生出來的希望，已是微弱得很，好像威到自己太低能，太沒出息，不配做什麽事，我的多量的哀愁就是在這種自省下產生出來的，看見別人一天一天地向着大的路上走，而自己仍立在黑暗與光明的界綫上，怎不慚愧呵！</p>
<p>看着春天去，又看着春天來，年年的春天是一樣好，一樣的年靑，而自己的心情是一年比一年老，人還年靑而心却已走近暮年，想起這，連自己也不禁一嚇，童心那裏去了？年靑人的熱情那裏去了？變着烟，變着霧，給生活的大風吹走了。</p>
<p>內心中那股熱情，自從去年給秋天帶走以後，一直到現在，我還是冷着心情看着世問一切事物的變化，我何常不想把這冰冷了的情感重新燃燒起來，可是，這生活决定了我的意志，使我常常想起來到結果又只得躱下去，一個眼睛回顧着舊的過去的園地，另一個眼睛又遙望着新的未來的境界，在這種情形之下，有誰能禁得住矛盾不在自己心上作威，有誰不會被矛盾引到幽暗的小室裏去？</p>
<p>每到春天，總免不了生出一點思鄉的情感，而且今年似乎更加濃厚了一點，故鄉整整的八個年頭沒有回去過了，據純弟來信說，故鄕是比八年前瘦了許多，冷靜了許多，每一個小巷子裏，都有瘦長的黑手伸出來，向行人求乞。壯健的年靑人都流向都市裏去了。故鄕盡管向着死亡的綫上走，然而，故鄉總還有種種使我懷念的事件，越長遠不回家，就越發懷念到家，我想，這大槪不是我個人才是這樣的吧。</p>
<p>故鄕的春天，在門前的小山上，開滿了紫色的野花，小時候，總是十朶百朵地採回來，挿在床前，挿在祖母的衣襟上，也挿在自己的身上，散了，明天又去採，橫竖春天不去，花是採不完的。而現在，我案頭花瓶上也有着朶朵的紫色的花，可沒有兒時那種心情把花挿在自己的衣襟上了。</p>
<h3 id="c237">論「文人相輕」（三） <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>淸末，上海有人定近世文人筆語爲五十家，將章太炎和譚復生，黃公度一同選在其中。章太炎與鄧實書云：「譚黃二子，志行顧亦有可觀者。然學術旣疏，其文辭又少檢核，僕雖樸陋，未敢與二子比肩也。近世文士王壬秋，可謂遊於其藩，猶多掩襲聲華，未能獨往；康長素時有善言而稍譎奇自恣；僕亦不欲與二賢並列，謂宜刋削鄙文，無令猥厠！」其時，梁啟超的政論文，風靡全國，誰都受他的影響，而章太炎譏之云：「如嚮者一二耆秀，皆浮華交會之材。譁世取寵之士，噓枯吹生之文，非所謂文質彬彬者也。故曰：「亡而爲有，虛而爲盈，約而爲泰，難乎有恒矣！」」章太炎又十二分看不起林紓嚴復的翻譯文字，謂：「下流所仰，乃在嚴復，林紓之徒！復辭雖飭，氣體比於制舉，若將所謂曳行作姿者也！紓視復又彌下，辭無涓選，精采雜汗，而更浸潤唐人小說之風！去欲物其體勢，視若蔽塵，笑若齲齒，行若曲肩，自以爲妍，而祇益其醜也！」這樣一方面要適合時代的需要，（啟超自謂：「至是自解放，務爲平易暢達，時雜以俚語，韻語，及外國語法，縱筆所至不檢束。學者競效之，號新文體，老輩則痛恨，詆爲野狐；然其文條理明晰，筆鋒常帶情戚，對於讀者，別有一種魔力焉。」）一方面要切切實實的學問，（太炎自謂：「效唐宋之持論者利其齒牙，效漢之持論者爲其記誦，斯已給矣：效魏晉之持論者，上不徒守文，下不可禦人以口，必先豫之以學。」）也會絕不留情，形之詞色的。</p>
<p>照這樣看來，眞的，文塊有如戰塲，自古以來，從不曾有過「平靜無事」的氣象。但以種種不同的立塲，擺開陣勢，厮殺了三百回合才鳴鉦收兵，却並不是文壇的惡現象，古今中外的文學是這樣才進步了的。當雨果的愛爾那尼，於一八三〇年二月十五日夜間，在法蘭西劇塲上演：那些古典派作家？坐在樓上及其他各處，打算妨害演技；一方面浪漫派作家及同情於他們的靑年，多聚集在樓下正廳，防備古典派的搗亂，一時劇塲好像變成戰塲：然而經過這番猛烈鬥爭以後，浪漫主義便邁步走入法蘭西文壇了。把眼前的事來看，新民衆報和民報的熱烈爭辯，展開了辛亥以來的大局面；新靑年的衝鋒，發動了五四運動的大潮；在文化猛進的期間，文壇上大動干戈，大槪是必不可避免的罷。假若「文人相輕」果如「吾家」子桓所說的「各以所長，相輕所長」，只是一種「批評」，並不是「人身攻擊」，我覺得應該有而且必然會有的。蘇子瞻上神宗書云：「君子和而不同，小人同而不和；和如和羹，同如濟水。故孫寳有言：周公大聖，召公大賢，猶不相悅，着於經典，兩不相損。晋之王導，可謂元臣，每與客言，舉坐稱善，而王述不悅，以爲人非堯舜，安得每事盡善；導亦斂衹謝之」。我們難道希望今日之文壇，變成一鼻孔出氣，誰都唯唯諾諾過日子嗎？</p>
<p>所以，我是不反對「文人相輕」的；我希望中國文壇能養成健全有力的批評空氣！（完）</p>

<p>一個消息說：敎育局新下的命令，塾師都要考試了。考題非常難，而且要考三民主義，不及格的不准敎書，實際七這就是收拾私塾的法子。本鄕幾個塾帥的名單，區立小學校已經全部開淸呈報了上去。</p>
<p>又一個消息說。區公所向公安分周遞了公函，說各私塾强拉學校裏的學生，蓄意破壞敎育，擾亂治安，貽誤學實，馬上要派警察來封鬥了。……</p>
<p>此外還有許多近乎荒唐的恐怖消息，天天像張着翅膀似的飛過來。對於它們，巨卿先生雖然有些懷疑，却不敢不相信，就是最荒誕得明知是謠傳的消息，也不敢肯切地將它否定。他鎭日提心吊胆地，完全爲這風聲所惶惑。</p>
<p>他再也無暇顧到整頓學風的問題了。</p>
<p>接連六七天，巨卿先生都被句圍在一種惶惑利恐懼的寡圍當中。</p>
<p>事實也許不會像謠傳的那麽厲害，但區立小學校不肯輕易罷休是一定的，他明白這一點。想個對付的方法吧，沒有—他有什麽力量跟學校對抗？跟鎭上所有的塾帥聯絡一下，協力對付倒是個上策，巨卿先生也想到了；可是固執的性情却使他猶豫起來：跟那些不三不四的敎書先生去攪在一起嗎？他巨卿先生目前雖然景况有點落拓，但他還有着一身的傲骨呢！</p>

<h3 id="c239">美總統權力未及大海 <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— 小民</p>
<p>前日國民社米阿米電，羅斯福總統，昨在游艇，垂釣一日，未獲一魚，今日往遊康斯浦登島，某隨員笑謂總統日，大總統之權力，似未能及於大海也，該隨員此語，極爲滑稽而幽默，權力旣不能及於大海，遑論兩洋。</p>
<p>美國的傳統政策，便是欲操縱世界霸權，但是一到了事機緊迫，無可操縱的時候，馬上轉過身來，嚴守中立，恐怕牽入戰事漩渦，這固是美國人的一付釣魚手段。現在歐亞兩洲，戰雲彌漫，美國又來一個特別戒備，恐防牽入漩渦，這樣看來，大總統的權力未及大海一語，頗堪玩味。</p>
<p>從前小說上說，姜太公八十遇文王，一天姜子牙在渭水之濱垂釣，適文王經過該地，命侍臣前去問話，子牙道，大魚不來，小魚去罷，文王曉得此人，必有來歷，親去訪問，語言投機，喜日，吾太公望子久矣，乃載之而歸，這樣的一個大魚，輕輕地便把太公釣着了。</p>
<p>又說，文王也喜歡釣魚，但是他的釣鈎，不是曲的，而用直的，他的意思，便是願者上釣，不願者不强的意思，試問那一條魚，有情願上鈎之理，此種假仁假義，沽名釣譽的手段，天然是另有一種作用，這種釣法，便是釣取民心。</p>
<p>現在美國的大總統，釣來釣去，釣了一天，而未獲一魚。大約在現在潮流之中，美國的操縱政策，似尙未能得到相當時機呢。</p>
<h3 id="c240">阿福飯店 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— 華之</p>
<p>船到了埠頭，迎面那所警察亭子的屋簷下飄着一牌「阿願飯店」的招牌引起了我的注意。因爲小鎭上沒有旅店，船到埠頭又是在黃昏時候，到西村的人都要趕夜路，那所警察派出所就那樣設立的。隨着衆人上了碼頭，從阿福飯店裏跳出一個矮身材胖臉的傢伙把衆人攔到他店裏去。—幾年沒有歸家，故鄕的一切在我都覺得生疏了；不知所以地混進了飯店。從前狹小的臥室，現在擱上三張桌子，十來個人一胡蜂地坐滿了，那個胖臉的人就倒茶送面巾地忙起來；一邊問着每個客人吃些什麽菜。</p>
<p>我彷彿做夢似的坐在角落里。這里雖然是我的故鄉，但是船一到埠頭之後，都是陌生的景像。因爲不慣船行，肚子里似乎有什麼東西在湧上來，那個胖臉的人問我要吃什麽菜的時候，我呆住了。—不是我想不出一個菜的名目，或者簡直不想吃飯；這位店主人不就是從前揹上黑制服的警察嗎？曾爲了路上出了搶案，他到過西村來的；那矮矮的身材，胖臉，頰上的肉把眼睛堆成一條綫，一尊彌勒佛似的永遠是一張笑臉！</p>
<p>「先生到西村去的？」</p>
<p>我想回答他我是西村陸鄉紳的兒子，但是自己像一個村里的人嗎？從這個埠頭上岸的都是西村人，只要聽一口西頭的鄉音就能知道的。我不能說故鄉的言語，又是身上一付不尴不尬的服裝，那現在做了飯店老闆的阿福或者他用了警察的目光來相視我了。</p>
<p>「你呌阿福？」</p>
<p>「是的。先生吃什麼菜？」</p>
<p>「這警察派出所爲什麼停辦了？」</p>
<p>「先生是西村人？」阿福驚奇起來，就是那些我不認識的同鄉人都飄過奇異的目光來，「停了許久了。—自從陸鄕紳過後，西村好像沒有了主子，輪的派警察捐誰都不肯掏腰包，陸太太獨自墊了幾個月…小少爺出門了這末久，又沒有一佃消息，這年頭兒做好人都沒有好收塲！」</p>
<p>吃飯的人都七張八嘴起來。我紅着臉，半晌說不出話。獨自兒飄流在外面十多年，故鄉變成這個模樣兒了：父親死了我沒有知道，母親恐怕日夜盼望着她兒子歸來吧？</p>
<p>「陸太太現在安好？」</p>
<p>「先生認識他家的？現在就是到西村去嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的。—我就是她的兒子！」</p>
<p>大家圍了攏來，相視着我，一時飯店內寂然無聲，彷彿是空氣壓緊了使他們開不來口。但是我知道這是他們喜歡過分的表示，他們欣幸做好人的爸爸沒有絕嗣！</p>
<p>但是我有什麽報答他們這種隆厚的盛情呢？別來十餘年，母親在困難之中生活着，自家這顆飽經創傷的心能够再投到溫暖的抱懷中去碼？</p>
<p>我迷惘地望着昏黃的煤油燈，眼前的一切漸漸模糊，終於看不見這生疏的故鄉！</p>
<h3 id="c241">長子三太太 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>說起長子三太太，她的個子並不比任何人長，但是偏生人家都呌她長子三太太的。要是像一般人的見解，說她現在是老縮了，那句話可也不能够完全信任；因爲當我七八歲的時候，她還是一個很壯健的中年婦人，那時的她也不見得會比現在長出多少來，如果這長子二字是指她的男人—長子三公公—那末也許還有些理由。不過等到我出世的當兒長子三公公是早已故世了，所以他有多麽樣長，我可沒有看見過他。</p>
<p>據說長子三太太是在二十六歲就死了男人，年靑守寡到了現在雖是六十多歲的人，可倒很健旺，我從小到如今不曾聽見她生過一次利害的病，一頭烏光汕油的修髮，一口雪白整齊牙齒呌人家看了一定會疑心才不過四五十歲呢！</p>
<p>她並沒有一個親生兒子或女兒，不過從二房裏承繼了一個姪子過來；但她從不去管他們的事，只有自己燒來自己吃，平常總坐在家裏唸佛或粘元寳，再把元寳向村中每一家去兜賣，賺些錢來貼補貼補零用，閒來或者到自己提出的幾塊山地裏去走走，看看花果樹木。</p>
<p>長子三太太是愛情淸潔的，她的人緣也怪好，村前村後沒有一個人會和她結怨的。她最恨的是做佛頭和坐夜，因此她一生以來就沒有當過一回佛頭，或到廟堂裏去坐過一次夜。燒香她並不反對，不過她不願意上杭州和普陀去，她燒香總在就近地方，有時也在自己家裏的天井中燒一回，磕上幾個頭就算數了。她：「千佛萬佛就是一佛，燒香不論遠近，祗要誠心，何必趕上一千八百里路去借了佛名遊山玩景呢？」</p>
<p>她的承繼媳婦和她不很對的，這差兒當然是她的媳婦不好；好吃懶做不算數，不是還要暗底裏來偸她的東西去，並且連勇人也結　掇得媽都好久沒聽見從他嘴裏吐過一聲了。但是她也不去計較這些；因爲她自己明白，他們的承繼過來，原不過看相她一份遺產，並不是親生骨肉，她想：反正遺產早晚總要給他們的，自己决不好帶到棺材裏去，現在落得泰氣些做一份現成人情，省得多生煩惱。</p>
<p>最近她家裏的正廳二樑上，已掛着一只「松柏同貞」的珠紅漆小匾額；那只匾是闔鄉的幾位紳董們贈給她的，而且聽說還在石公山節烈祠裏替她進了一個生位，這是算她一生以靑春幸福所換來的「光榮收穫」了！</p>
<h3 id="c242">南歸散記 <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— 天騏</p>
<p>歸家人的心事大槪都是很焦急的。到淞市的當晚，聽到縣淞公路已經通車，明農七點有一班汽車可搭，眞是喜出望外。若照往常走法，由淞市到縣城一段水程，至快也要兩天滿滿纔走得完；現在可以縮短在三小時內走到，那是多麽輕快的事。雖然要多花一點車資，自己也覺得很是値得了。</p>
<p>天還沒有碧白，夥計就來呌門，說是車少人多，要先兩個鐘頭到車站去。於是草草吃完早點，卽整裝出發。淞市本是一個小墟塲，走完一條小街，拐過巷就是郊野了。這時冥朦的夜影籠網着大地，四面山影幢幢；啟明星拖着殘光髙高的吊在玉指峯頭。走過人家門前，撩起一陣犬吠。離家近了，聽到這親切的犬吠，心頭不禁揚溢着莫名的快慰。</p>
<p>到了車站，果然已擠滿了一團人。離開車時間還差兩個鐘頭，只好站在一邊硬等了。但是一邊看到這個形勢，心里又不禁動搖了，車只有兩輛。人是這麽多，萬一擠不上車，轉搭墟船又來不及，就要在淞市再停一晚，這就糟了。</p>
<p>好容易捱到天亮，汽車纔慢條斯理的從車房里開出。這時的情形是不待說雜亂到難以形容的，前面已擠不上，後面又拚死的湧來；自己給挾在中間，簡直無施展餘地。幸得店夥死命往前衝，從車窗攀援進去，纔佔得一個位子。</p>
<p>這時喘息方定，車也凖備開行了。就在這個時候，突然走來兩個槍上挿着刺刀的兵爺，來勢洶洶的在車頭上一拍：</p>
<p>—不能開！</p>
<p>這一聲「不能開」的力量，好似當頭霹靂，震得滿車搭客對視無言。我雖然是一個異地歸來的遊子，看到這情形，也體會得出八九分是怎麽回事。可是那個司機可出人意外的提出反抗：</p>
<p>—你們連部里在事先可幷沒有知會</p>
<p>—丢那媽！沒有知會便怎樣？汝開我看！</p>
<p>—我們照道理行……</p>
<p>拍的一聲，司機的嘴巴上已貼上一個巴掌？另一個兵爺就隨手抓着司機的臂膀往外一扯，早已四脚朝天的跌在路上。</p>
<p>—丢那媽！看老祖槍斃汝這土匪！</p>
<p>那個兵爺托過槍頭就作起放射的手勢，但這時搭客們不期然呼喊起來了：</p>
<p>—不能！</p>
<p>—不能！</p>
<p>經了一陣短暫的騷亂，兵爺的槍雖然沒放？但是車子還是開不出去，而且臉上給打得像南瓜一樣浮腫的司機也給帶到連部里去了。</p>
<p>第二天，我終於扔了搭車的心，捱了兩天困悶的水程纔到達縣城。</p>
<h3 id="c243">夜遁 <a href="#c243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>

<p>三十個人一隊—我也是其中之一—盡量的使脚步聲小到不能再小；就是呼吸也不放過重；這並不是我們神經過敏，疑神疑鬼；實在的：如果我們不這樣做，馬上會陷入敵人的嚴密包圍中！會變做階下囚！會身首異處！我們知道：敵人之對我們，是殘酷到極點的。</p>
<p>豆油燈光般的月亮，由灰烏色的雲層中射了出來；沒有蘆草的黃泥路上，尙能依稀辨出路的綫條來：但這我們不能走比較平整的大路，必須往滿生着盧草的小路走，爲了避免意外的危險，差不多手掌變成了脚在地下爬着。</p>
<p>崎嶇不平到處是窪的小路，上面還散佈着刺穿鞋底的尖石子、更加一陣陣的麻線兩下起來了！身上感到冷，脚上又增加了滑，從晚七時走到午夜後一時，我想最多走了十五里路：可是兩隻脚</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>却被一歪跛弄痛了。</p>
<p>蘆草的小徑，在午夜二時總算走完了。緊接着蘆草小徑的盡頭展開在我們眼前的：是一條相當寬的大江；銀白色的江水，在黯淡的月光下，靜穆的夜中，是異常優美而富於詩意的；然而，我們並沒有閒情來體味這些，在靜穆和危險的境遇中。我的耳中却被每一個人髙速度的心之顫抖所侵佔着。把腰彎到九十度，在淺草的口邊如猿猴一般輕捷的疾走着：我們已逼近異常危險，生死關一頭的境地了！我們能不能繼續活下去，就要看今夜能不能够度過這條江！因爲據探子的報吿：敵人已駐紮在對江的小村莊中了。</p>
<p>浮橋，在一陣緊急的奔走中向我們接近了！我們的手，都握住了槍，預備到必要時與敵人肉搏搏！血戰！</p>
<p>「口令」！由對河的密林中傳出了這麽的一聲。我相信我們三十個人的心都躍到了喉嚨里。</p>
<p>我們一聲不響的衝了過去！想從死路中找出一條生路！「口令」！第二聲更急促了！</p>
<p>「口令」！第三次發出還得不到回答，哨兵「砰」的就是一槍。</p>
<p>我們的排槍射了過去，哨兵的槍聲是寂然了。我們像瘋狂了一般的衝過去！</p>
<p>但是在依稀的月光下橫着的哨兵屍體，原來是自己的人。這由衣服的標記上可以看到，雖則是在陰暗的月下。</p>
<p>一陣雜亂的脚步聲由對面山脚邊瀉了出來，我們知道：大約是聽到哨兵檢聲，及我們的排槍聲來救援的。爲了免除誤會計，我們大聲向他們打着暗號。</p>

<h3 id="c248">迭司耐卡通畫室米老鼠畫片的攝製工作 <a href="#c248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— 黃影呆</p>
<p>在銀慕上面，我們所看見的米老鼠畫片，放映的時間十分鐘，但在畫室之中製作的時候，當有八星期之久。</p>
<p>攝製一張米老鼠畫片，第一部工作便是决定故事，大槪—但不是一定—先由迭斯耐造意，預備在新片之中，米老鼠將何種冒險工作。意思有了之後，再由迭司耐畫室中職員二十五人或三十人，舉行一次會議，來决定這個故事，故事的輪廓，計畫定當之後，再由幽默家麥與工作，决定便米老鼠在這故事中，每個畫面，如何動作，並儘量攙入足以使人發笑的滑稽材料。</p>
<p>第二部手續便是經過一番麻煩的繪畫工作，滑稽的晝面，重要的對話，都要逐條的畫出。</p>
<p>普通一張短片要九千至一萬幅畫攝成，而每一幅畫，都用手續的。攝上膠片，每張要攝取一次，所以工作的繁重，亦就可想而知了。</p>
<p>在迭司耐以爲音響不但要加入，而且要和米老鼠的動作符合，每一個步子的動作，要和每一個音樂的調子相和。因此除了繪畫之外，第二種重要工作，便是作曲，這種工作，在編成故事以後，但在繪畫之前。我們可以想像到這曲譜舊如是十一拍，那麽米老鼠在畫面上便應走十一步，所以先要譜曲，然後繪畫。</p>
<p>有一位設計領袖，好像普通影片公司裏面導演，他根據了音樂的調子和故事中的挿話，很小心的支配每一個畫家的工作，自米老鼠走進畫面，以至離開畫面，應當怎樣動作。</p>
<p>這個領袖，使每一叚畫片和音樂的調子相和，大致平常他要編輯九千張畫，每一張畫要畫家繪成的。</p>
<p>畫片移到膠片上面，而背景呢，有時一百幅或一百以上的畫是差不多的。所以這種盡片，就不必每張都要畫過，祇須重攝而已。畫片繪好而攝影完舉之後，第二部工作便是配音。</p>
<p>在一問配音室的裏面，紀錄音響，有一個小的樂隊，坐在角子裏，對面是一間玻璃房，樂隊開始就在這一間玻璃房中由領隊指揮之下，試騐一次。</p>
<p>配音室的裏面，放着一隻長桌子，差不多和這間屋一樣長，四面放滿了用具，四五個人立在桌子前面，放着一架收音機，另外在樂隊前面，更有幾架小的收音機。這些人都是音樂專家，他們能使每一個音調奏出意想不到的興奮的情調來。</p>
<p>米老鼠畫片在迭司耐畫室之中，工作完了之時，畫攝在一種膠片上，音在另一種上，後然把他們併在一起。這種工作是比較的簡單各個影片公司都能做的。什麼都完畢之後，然後决定要印多少考貝。</p>
<p>滑稽的卡通畫片，並不是由迭司耐發明的，一九二八年有聲對白影片的突然發明，使電影事業形將全部崩潰之時，卡通畫片早就不是新奇的東西了。</p>
<p>一九二八年的初期，迭司耐幻想到以老鼠爲片中主角，起初他把這老鼠定名爲Mortmer　Mouse後來改做Mickey，完全爲簡短起見。卡片上早前兔子和其他動物，早己和我們見面，米老鼠的上銀幕，不過是擴大一個獸家庭而已。</p>
<p>到了同年的春天，迭司耐又有一種意想，决定使米老鼠的動作，配上音樂，結果是成功了，這才是一種新的發明。</p>
<p>迭司耐最初把他的畫片另售於幾家大的影片公司中，直到後來，在紐約遇到一個予以經濟上帮助的人才得獨立。他的畫片九月中在一家小戲院中公映之時，得到紐約觀衆莫大的贊美，從此米老鼠畫片便佔到了重要的地位。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c249">評「莽漢懺情」 <a href="#c249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— 鐘非</p>
<p>Border　Town——大光明</p>
<p>在「時代的進展」及「亡命者」等作品中，獲得了極髙的演技成績，而在「神探尼萊」一片中又無甚可取的保爾茂尼，他給與了深刻的印象和好感，因而這一「莽漢懺情」，又引起觀衆很大的注意。當明星中心制的目前，人們常以主演者爲目標，藉以揣測某一影片的好壞。一方面因着演員們給與觀衆最直接的注意，另一方面主演的名字，在影片的廣吿牌上，有時候是比片名還要寫得大的。</p>
<p>但是從演員身上以决定影片的好壞，决不是合理的。固然電影是綜合藝術，明星的演技，佔着影片搆成的重要部門之一，可是當導演編劇，特別是劇本，並不能奠定作品成功一之基礎的時候，即使是天才的演員，也祇好無能爲力了。保爾茂尼在「神探尼萊」中的不能成功，便是明顯的好例。有那一演員能在庸俗的劇本中獲得偉大的成功呢？因而關於「莽漢懺情」的評價，我們並不能僅以主演者的演技爲依據，反之對於劇的內容的檢討，到是我們最主要的任務。</p>
<p>就這一影片的故事看來，劇作者有着勃烈的正義感，他對於現社會有着相當程度的憤懣，乃是很明白的表現。在出身卑賤的男主人公身上，表現着他對社會的不滿。他向社會要求正義，不，他更有偉大之懷抱代表自己的一羣向社會要求正義，因此，他以五年的光陰在一設備簡陋的髙等法律學校畢業之後，立刻以母親兌換戒指得來的錢掛了律師牌子，他是滿懷着林肯的精神爲貧民們保障人權。然而第一次執行業務，便深信自己的理想落了空，（富女駕車撞傷了窮老漢，結果只消出二十五元賠價費。他亦被取銷律師的資格。）他肯定的說。現社會沒有公理或正義存在，祗要有金錢和權勢便能成爲勝利者。寫到這裏爲止，劇作者的憤懣是充分表現出來了的。但是劇的主題在什麽地方呢？劇作者並不能指示這正義感的靑年從事於實際的有效的奮鬥，而是個人主義的爲了向社會復仇而企圖獲得金錢與權勢。這種人物的存在我們並不否認，正義感的靑年們，不能走向集團主義的道路，便祗有個人主義的復仇。不過當他們在殘酷的現實中再鍜鍊一番，當他們的最後希望也幻滅了的時候，他們就必然的覺團過來，從個人主義的歧途走向積極的道路的。然而劇作給舊的世界觀迷惑着，對現實認識，並不能正確的觀察；當他筆下的男主人公，獲得了金錢之後又懂得階級的存在的時候，（他向富家女郞求婚，女郞以階級懸殊，拒絕了他的請求）他是消極的皈依到神的信仰中去了。這極充分的表現了劇作者從積極到消極的怯懦，同時作爲敎育意義。而給與觀衆的印象。</p>
<p>在這裏，就己經判明了這一影片價値的髙下。再能說到的便祗是屬於技術方面的。從保爾茂尼的化裝上，（他爲了扮裝墨西得人，將面孔塗成褐色，同時並襯出他眼睛的白凈有力，）你便可知道他很有天才而且很認眞的。他將我們經常可以看到的正義感的靑年剛毅而智慧的個性，活生生的表現出來。可是剛本使他沒有重頭戲可做，結果他在這裏只給與人們盡職到爐火純靑的程度。反之在女主角方面，編劇者和導演却加重了她的內心描寫，當她殺死了丈夫，而又得不着情人的愛情，因而引起恐怖的變熊，這在白蝶黛維絲演來是頗有相當成績的。（不過那吃緊的地方大概重拍了好幾次，所以跳得很厲害。）就在這裏表現了導演手法的細膩，這心理描寫的成功，應當是本片最主要的技術成就。</p>
<h3 id="c250">評「巡捕怕老婆」 <a href="#c250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— 華倫</p>
<p>“It’s　a　Cop”—大上海映</p>
<p>首先得說的便是「巡捕怕老婆」這一譯名未免太「生意眼」而有些不適合全劇的內容了。因爲這裏袋被描寫的那個劇中主人公巡捕，雖然是有點怕老婆，可是劇作者主要的却是要借一個比較優的巡捕的不幸運的遭遇，作了一次「優孩子們，拼着你們的使勁幹去，心身方面吃些優苦也不打緊，憑這可以升官發財的」這樣的說敎。但是作者同時爲了生意經，乃不得不苦心地用極低級的趣味來迎合觀衆，於是在可笑的噱頭中，觀衆們一陣的哄堂大笑，便哄走了他說敎的本意，反效呆地把那巡捕吃了許多傻苦後的升官塲面，也成爲可笑的結局了。</p>
<p>情節開展在巡捕史勃萊奉令去監視一羣盜賣某製造廠重要秘方的匪徒，倒被女匪包白蒂迷惑了，放走那些匪徒，因此被巡捕解職，而陷於被老婆責駡得可憐又可笑的情况中。後因偶然的巧合，又追蹤到那羣匪徒，而再度被迷，更演出了種種可笑的尴尬事。結果再來一個凑巧，終於使這吃盡苦頭的巡捕，破了案子，功成名就。</p>
<p>如此空虛的故事，再加上幾次的偶然巧合這些編劇上的缺點，自然覺得無甚可取了。不過，由於主演者雪泥霍華德那副尷尬的嘴臉，誇張的做作，以及可笑的遭遇，的確可以給予觀衆不少笑料的。</p>
<p>導演Maclean　Rogers小聰敝處倒很多。霍德的演做自始至終是一貫的誇張，賊頭賊腦的腔調，與糊裏糊塗的地方，從發音到動作，都有太形裝腔作勢之感。自然，這是這一類片子中這一型角色的通病，而比較地說，這裏的霍華德倒算是成功了的。</p>
<p>全劇過份着重於霍華德演的巡捕這角色的戲了，因此全劇情緒與調子就都畸形地發展着。演技方面除了溜冰兩塲戲中的溜冰技術頗為可觀外，全配角就沒有什麽可以施展了。</p>

<p>— 彤雲</p>
<p>彭尼斯德拉住了珠麗亞的衣襟道：「你發瘋了。」珠麗亞道：「一點也不錯，我是瘋了。這都是你弄出來的。」她狠命的捶着彭尼斯德，嘴裏喊着：「放手！我要去和雪倫理論去。我將我們的關係吿訴了她之後，看她還要你不要你！」彭尼斯德拉住了她，聽了她的話一時怒不可遏起來。他說：「你想吿訴她？」珠麗亞還是很命地掙扎着。彭尼斯德兩手揑住了她的喉嚨。珠麗亞起初還睜大了眼睛掙扎了一回，不久，就低下頭去不動了。</p>
<p>彭尼斯德將珠麗亞放倒在地下，口中還唁唁罵道：「你還告訴她嗎！」不久他手中搿着許多木頭，走進了屋子。他看見雪倫正在打電話。她拿着電話筒道：「勃郞却先生？我是雪倫那各脫。我吿訴你，我不能再幹下去了。我實在沒有工夫寫那條河邊總會的新聞了。最好請你自己寫吧。」</p>
<p>她說完了，掛上了電話，對着彭尼斯德道。：「走吧。出去走走去。我肚子餓了。我們去找一個吃食車子，去吃些杳腸去。」彭尼斯德這時亦沒有心情再去留住她，就陪她走到外面，坐上了他的汽車。彭尼斯德加足了速率，一直向前開去。雪倫在車子裏，一時想起了傑姆勃郞却，恨不得他能聽見彭尼斯德對她訴說的愛，好讓他知道她不是什麼優瓜，眞的自頂至踵愛着他哩。她在深思之中，忽然看見路旁，停着一輛吃食車子，就叫彭尼斯德煞車。她說：「我們可以吃些火腿蛋。」</p>
<p>彭尼斯德本來不願意停車的，但是因爲雪倫堅持着，他不得不停了下來。他們正在吃食車上吃火腿蛋的時候，那車上裝着一個無綫電放音機。那放音機時時放着警務局的傳呼。這時那放音機忽然喊着：「警車四十七號……到施柏魯斯街一千零零一號去……夫妻打架……」一回又喊道：「一切的警車……火速到愛文紐路六十二號…火速…火速…」</p>
<p>彭尼斯德的心勃勃地跳着，正不知道他自己的案子發現了沒有，或者無綫電亦會呌出來的。等到雪倫將火腿蛋吃完了，他連忙將錢擲在櫃上，拉了雪倫就走。雪倫不覺奇怪道。。「怎麽回事？你急些什麽？」</p>
<p>明天一早，傑姆勃郞却跑到那各脫家裏。他吿訴雪倫，珠麗亞柏德森已經被人謀害了，並且要叫她設法將他帶到柏德森家裏去。他說：「這個案子很離奇，並且發生在昨晚河邊總會第一晚開幕之後，外面謠言很盛，不知道會牽涉到誰的名字，以至於被報紙上登了出來。如果我在柏德森家裏，我可以設法不讓他們牽連到你的名字。」</p>
<p>雪倫一聽他的話很有道理，就答應了他，並且竭力裝着冷淡的神氣謝了他一聲。不久，他們已經到了柏德森的家裏。他們在穿堂中，聽着便衣偵探正在査問柏德森家的僕役。僕役們都說，他們的男主人昨晚從河邊總會回來的時候，因爲喝了些酒，脾氣似乎不大好。一個女傭人又說隔夜主人和主婦曾爭吵過。彭尼斯德的大名，亦時時在僕役們的口中提到。他們又說亨利柏德森曾有一次毆打過他的女人。（未完）</p>

<p>Guiyang: According to captured communist bandits, Zhu De, one of the three major communist leaders, died in battle three days ago. Zhu was the commander-in-chief of the communist army in Guizhou. He recently planned to attack Guiyang, but failed and died. The communist bandits who fled east, intending to join forces with He Long's forces in Hunan Province, have had their retreat cut off by government troops. Yesterday, this force moved west and reached a certain town in Longli. Longli is located east of Guiyang, about twenty miles away, but is surrounded by government and Yunnan troops. A small portion of the communist bandits has fled east, but their main force is currently heavily besieged. It is estimated that about 2,000 enemy soldiers have died. The information obtained in Guangzhou is not very accurate. The communist bandits are intentionally avoiding contact with government troops, so the fighting has never reached an intense level. After the government troops recovered Xifeng, there were no executions of captured communists. Furthermore, the actual strength of the communist bandits is apparently less than rumored. According to estimates by local military authorities, the number of bandits is no more than ten thousand, while the government troops in Guizhou Province number about thirty thousand. Foreign missionaries left Guiyang last week voluntarily, not due to encouragement from the authorities. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The 10th Army's Office in Hankou recently received a telegram from Sangzhi stating that Xiao and He's bandit force, which had entrenched itself in Western Hunan, was routed by our forces in Sangzhi and Dayong. They then gathered in the Tawo, Sanjiatian, Gongyuanjie, Binlangjie, and Yingpan'ao areas southwest of Sangzhi, stubbornly resisting from fortified positions. Our 26th Division of the 3rd Column, led by Guo Rudong, and the Independent 34th Brigade have been suppressing them for days. Furthermore, Chen Yaohan and Zhang Liansan's two units of the 2nd Column, attacked the bandit's 1st Column, led by Zhang Zhenhan and Pan Shanzhai, from the north, while the two units advanced from Longshan to strike at the bandit's rear. The bandits were besieged on all sides and could not hold out after fighting until the 6th. Our 3rd Column, led by Guo Rudong, took advantage of the bandit's wavering position on the 6th and launched a fierce attack on the bandit positions at Huangqijie. At that time, the more than 2,000 bandits defending the area still attempted to resist from fortified positions. After our troops climbed the mountains and attacked, over three hundred bandits were killed, and the remainder fled towards Tawo. Our troops completely occupied the important bandit positions at Binlangjie, Xiangshijie, and Yingpan'ao at Shenshi time (3-5 PM) on the 6th and are currently continuing to advance and suppress Tawo. Furthermore, the pseudo-independent regiment that had fled from Sangzhi to Xiangjiaping in northeastern Guizhou has also been cleared by teams dispatched by Zhang Liansan's unit. There are now no bandit traces northeast of Sangzhi. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) A branch office of the puppet Central Bank has also been established inside the East Luocheng of Shanhaiguan, specializing in handling private matters of transporting silver dollars out of the pass. The work is all done at night. The puppet bank has recently sent many people to Tianjin and Beiping to buy up and smuggle out. The smuggling method is to sew pockets into cotton vests, ten in the front and ten in the back. Each pocket can hold fifteen yuan. The carriers wear them inside their clothes, so it is difficult to detect during customs inspections. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The value of puppet national paper currency is falling more and more sharply. There is a lack of cash, and the economy is in panic. The puppet Central Bank has specially ordered its Shanhaiguan branch to buy up a large amount of silver dollars, use puppet currency to promote it in Tangdong and other places, exchange it for cash to transport to the puppet territory, and consolidate finance. Recently, there has been an extreme shortage of silver dollars in various places in Luandong. Puppet currency is filled with puppet currency east of Tangshan and has replaced our currency status. Silver dollars are rarely seen easily. The method used by the puppet Central Bank of Shanhaiguan to purchase silver dollars is to send many traitors everywhere to search, and purchase them at a rate of more than 130 yuan of puppet currency per 100 yuan. The traitors who purchase them all dress up as farmers to avoid detection by the authorities. They also use Qinhuangdao as a transfer area, and Japanese military vehicles are used to load and transport them to Wanjiatun outside the pass at night, avoiding inspection by our customs officers at Shanhaiguan. They then take the puppet Fengshan railway car to Shenyang, shipping out more than ten boxes every day, about 50,000 or more. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong came to Beiping last night. This morning, he visited He Yingqin to report on his trip to the south. He then attended the routine meeting of the Military Branch Council. At noon, he received Yin Rugeng, Li Yunsheng, and Japanese military officer Takahashi at his private residence. It is scheduled to return to Tianjin tomorrow morning. According to talks, this trip south was to visit Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei to report on the military and political situation in Hebei Province and to discuss matters concerning the war zone and the project of blocking the Yellow River breach. The central government has sent Chuan Rulin to conduct a survey of the Yellow River blocking project, and plans to breach the Yellow River in Guantai, Henan Province. The counties and districts in Hebei Province that were flooded extend for about 300 li. The River Affairs Bureau is currently blocking the breach. The blocking project is the responsibility of the Labor Relief Bureau, the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, and the River Affairs Bureaus of the three provinces. After the breach in Guantai, if the blocking is successful, it will not cause a major disaster. The various counties and districts affected by the disaster are still being rushed and blocked by the River Affairs Bureau, the Labor Relief Bureau, and the Water Conservancy Commission. At the same time, various materials are being prepared. The rotation of the new and old security teams in the war zone was originally scheduled to take place on the 15th, but due to preparations, it may start around the 2nd. The old security teams, such as Zhou Yuying, Fan Jinghua, and Zhou Zhicheng, will all be transferred out. The remaining units, such as Liu Zuozhou, Zhao Lei, Feng Shoupeng, and Li Jiusheng, will be reduced in force according to the established quota.

<p>(Tianjin) Qi Shouan, Director of the Hebei Maritime Affairs Bureau, returned to the Construction Office and received a telegram from Qi on the 9th, reporting that after extending the permeable dam and slow flow project, the project conditions have improved, and the water conditions at the breach are exceptionally calm, with the deepest point being less than twenty meters. Hebei's contribution of 50,000 for dyke repairs was remitted to the River Affairs Bureau by the Construction Office on the 10th. Furthermore, 100,000 yuan of central government funds for post-disaster river works has been brought to the construction site by Qi Shouan for application. Hu Yuanhui of the Construction Office talked about the fact that since the completion of the permeable dam in Guantai, the mouth has been silting with mud and sand, and the water depth has been reduced to 20 meters. Now that the peach flood has passed, the river water will not rise again recently, and the damming project should be able to proceed smoothly. The River Affairs Bureau is rushing to prepare materials for dyke repairs and post-disaster relief in this province, but the land along the river and behind the river is a vast expanse of water, and it is difficult to obtain soil. There are only a hundred or so skilled river soldiers, who are still serving in Guantai, which is somewhat unsatisfactory. However, the River Affairs Bureau has been instructed to rush to construct so that it can be completed before the summer flood. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>

The scope of taxation particularly focuses on not disturbing the people and is limited to what the social environment and the people's financial resources can achieve. The tax rate strives to be low, and the scope is generally universal. Such as those belonging to operators, such as banks. Companies, private enterprises and business shops that do not belong to the Company Law, (whose capital is more than 5,000 yuan) belonging to people, such as public officials at all levels, freelance lawyers. Accountants, reporters. Technicians and industrial and commercial managers, etc., collect tax rates in addition to the prescribed tax-exempt groups, and adopt a progressive tax system. Roughly, the highest is 20 per mille, and the lowest is one or two per mille. The collection agency strives to be simple, and will attach the tax agency of the Ministry. The outer provinces are collected by the agency of the Ministry. The collection procedures and the training of collection personnel must be carefully studied. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e22">German Newspaper Comments on Sino-Japanese Relations: Forcing a Ban on Boycotting Goods and Anti-Japanese Sentiment is Impossible for Any Government; Whether Sino-Japanese Friendship is Possible Will Depend on the Policies Adopted by Japan <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Berlin News: The Deutsche Tageszeitung is the most authoritative German newspaper, and Steed's comments on Far Eastern issues have always been fair and highly respected by the press. Recently, an essay on Sino-Japanese relations was published, first discussing the trends in modern international politics, and then discussing the current relations between China and Japan. It said that although there have been no official negotiations between the governments of China and Japan, there have been repeated informal preliminary discussions. Both sides have expressed a willingness to reach a peaceful understanding, and both are personal exchanges of views between responsible figures to create a good atmosphere for concrete negotiations. The beginning of this was Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota's speech in parliament on January 21, suggesting to China a peaceful compromise to seek cooperation. This intention was welcomed by China and the world. Unfortunately, at the same time, Japan used troops to inspect the border, and the Mainichi Shimbun published the so-called Japanese future diplomatic program, wanting to place China and "Manchukuo" on an equal footing and form a kind of Monroe Doctrine, which is enough to destroy the good atmosphere at that time. This is a common contradiction in Japanese diplomatic policy. In an essay published in a Shanghai newspaper, Chairman Chiang said that China and Japan should change their past attitudes, China should abandon its anti-Japanese mentality, and Japan should abandon its aggressive policies. He also explained this point in a conversation with Japanese Ambassador Arima. In his speech, President Wang said that peace is a prerequisite for China's unification and Sino-Japanese understanding. Then Wang Chonghui went to Japan and talked with Hirota, Hayashi, and other important Japanese figures. Although Wang traveled only in a private capacity, this move was very meaningful. Wang is a world-renowned jurist, and he is the most suitable person to create a good atmosphere at this time to prepare for future official Sino-Japanese negotiations. Judging from the current public sentiment in the two countries, mutual understanding is not easy. In order to solve the complex problems between the two countries and create a good relationship, Zeng Xuan said that Sino-Japanese relations are like two warring countries, after bloody battles, they suddenly realize that there is a need to change course, reform, and join hands again. After Japanese Ambassador saw Chairman Chiang, he stated that the Chinese government should stop boycotting Japanese goods and anti-Japanese propaganda as a prerequisite for future negotiations and understanding. However, to force the Chinese people to buy Japanese goods, or to make the Chinese people suddenly feel good about Japan, which has attacked China for several years and caused huge sacrifices, is not something that only the Chinese government cannot do, but that any government cannot do. Japan, which is famous for its national consciousness and patriotic psychology, must understand this situation. The Chinese government can enter into agreements and create friendly relations, but whether a friendly rapprochement between the two nations actually occurs will depend on whether the policies adopted by Japan in the future take into account China's sovereignty and the legitimate national feelings of the Chinese people. The Jing government has repeatedly said that direct Sino-Japanese negotiations are enough to quickly create a peaceful situation in the Far East. Now that the exchange of views has begun, if it is further developed into official negotiations, the Japanese government will have an appropriate opportunity to prove its own words. This Sino-Japanese negotiation should not be undermined by other countries. In fact, if China and Japan can be consistent with each other under the above-mentioned basic conditions, all countries (except Soviet Russia) will admire and welcome it as a glimmer of light in the darkness of the Far East. We should also hope that the European countries currently negotiating with Germany will first set a good example for Japan (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e23">Further Explanation for Handling "Small Credit Loans" <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>Recently, Tong Yi Trust Company published its first year's statistics on handling small loans with full repayment and zero borrowing. The analysis results show us not only the difficulties of the salaried class, but also a glimpse of the general social economic situation. It is found that Shanghai Bank was the earliest financial institution in our country to open this type of loan. In recent years, others have followed suit, including Shanghai Tongyi, Xinhua. China General Commerce. Shanghai　. Shanghai Trust. Ningbo Industrial. Secondary Credit Economic Credit Cooperative. There are many homes such as Siming Savings Association. Assuming that the outstanding balance of each home is 100,000 yuan, the total is about 1 million yuan. The number of borrowers is about 10,000. The total amount of loans released throughout the year should be in the range of two to three million yuan. The total number of borrowers is also between 20,000 and 30,000. If calculated according to this, its impact on the national economy seems to be not trivial.</p>
<p>Now the small credit loans that are handled are mostly capped at 500 yuan. The term is the longest at one year. The interest rate is 7.5 to 8 cents per month. All are prepaid. The borrower must also find two guarantors to assume the security responsibility. After that, the principal is repaid in installments, once a month. If calculated according to the present value formula of the annuity, the actual interest paid by the borrower is over one point and five tenths. Its burden cannot be said to be light. Therefore, those who criticize it believe that it is not without the suspicion of usurious exploitation. The general pessimists even believe that it will encourage extravagance and is not beneficial. Viewing from another perspective, the borrower of small loans is no different from requesting a discount on a part of their monthly salary.</p>
<p>However, in our observation, there is no doubt that small credit loans can meet the needs of the general public. The future effectiveness depends on how those who handle this business should play their role. Improper uses of loans that are not necessary should be prevented. How should the borrower's installment repayment cultivate their habit of keeping their promises? Therefore, before issuing a loan, there should be detailed investigation records. After the loan is issued, the management of the borrower must also be closely monitored. It has not been handled for a long time and is still in the experimental period. Complete statistical analysis is even more necessary. There is no need to shy away from it because of its poor effect.</p>
<p>Although the handling of small credit loans seems to have high profits, in fact, the procedures are cumbersome and the costs are relatively high. If this is considered a service to society by financial institutions, it should be fine. If it is regarded as an outlet for funds, it is feared that the actual difficulties may not be slightly less than others. In our humble opinion, the handling of small credit loans should be based on the principle of social service and should not be based on the premise of profit. Therefore, the funds must be allocated separately, and the accounting should also be independent. Within the possible range, there is even a need to slightly reduce the interest rate. As for the target of its borrowers, it seems that small factories and small shops should be the home. Even if there are personal loans, they should be strictly limited to avoid increasing social waste and losing the original intention of adjusting social finance.

<p>(Washington) The "Manchukuo" will implement a monopoly on kerosene sales starting tomorrow. Political circles here consider this a new obstacle in good international relations, and Japan should bear the responsibility. Officials stated today that this monopoly violates the Open Door Policy in China and the promises made by "Manchukuo" and Japanese officials to uphold that principle. There is an open expression here that although Japan claims to have no relationship with the "Manchukuo" kerosene monopoly, it cannot evade its actual responsibility. Japan's response to the recent US protest was delayed until the eve of the petroleum monopoly, which senior officials in Washington find completely incomprehensible. They also say this delay is disrespectful and clearly a tactic to prevent the US from making further representations. (9th National Telegram)</p>

<p>(London) This morning, all newspapers focused on the Stresa conference that will open tomorrow. Most of them wished the British delegation success in its difficult work. The Times stated that Europe will hardly achieve a resolution while Germany and other major powers are in a confrontational position and that the beneficial effects of Simon and Eden's recent visit to Berlin must be fully utilized in Stresa. The Daily Telegraph stated that Hitler's claim that Germany must have colonies before it can be on an equal footing with other nations is the most significant demand, but if this matter is to be seriously pursued, Hitler must change the way it is presented. The colonies that Germany lost in the war have never been demanded back in such a manner. The Morning Post stated that we should now decide to advocate joining the nations that are combined to jointly guarantee security and that our current policy of powerless mediation only causes resentment and suspicion. The Daily News stated that we should now make a final effort and unreservedly engage in consolidating the League of Nations Covenant and the more precise sanctions under Article 16, to preserve the League of Nations. The Daily Mail stated that British policy should frankly declare that the British government is determined to focus on British security and immediately build the strongest air force.

<h3 id="e27">Franco-Russian Gentlemen's Agreement Established - Strengthening the League of Nations Covenant's Sanction Clauses - Actually Contains a Military Alliance - Replaces the Eastern European Pact If It Fails <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) French Foreign Minister Laval and Soviet Russian Ambassador Potemkin met for two hours today, and have effectively agreed that if Germany and Poland continue to refuse to join the Eastern European Pact, France and Soviet Russia should conclude an agreement to replace it. The agreement is divided into two main parts: (1) Requesting the League of Nations Council to reaffirm and strengthen Articles 10, 16, and 17 of the Covenant; (2) Stipulating the mutual obligations of France and Soviet Russia under these articles.</p>
<p>The Soviet Russian Ambassador invited the diplomatic representatives of Romania, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey to a private dinner to exchange opinions on the overall European situation, and then telegraphed People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov, stating that they had approved the agreement. According to reports in the local newspapers, the agreement will eventually take the form of a military agreement and will be integrated with the revision of the League of Nations mechanism and will echo the suggestions made by France at the Stresa conference. France's suggestions include amending the League of Nations Covenant to effectively implement defensive cooperation, control arms limitations, and provide mutual military assistance agreements for countries to join. (9th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Key Points of the Agreement</p>
<p>(Geneva) Foreign Minister Laval and Soviet Russian Ambassador to France, Dankin, jointly agreed on the Franco-Russian agreement yesterday. The content is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The preamble is based on Articles 10, 16, and 17 of the League of Nations Covenant. Article 17 stipulates the protection of the territorial integrity and political independence of member states, Article 16 stipulates the sanction procedures to be taken when a member state engages in war, and Article 17 stipulates the sanction procedures to be taken when a non-League of Nations member state engages in war. In addition, it also cites the military measures that should be taken under Article 16, Paragraph 2 of the Covenant when a member state engages in war, in order to respect its obligations to the League of Nations (i.e., the Council should suggest to the governments of the countries concerned the effective land, sea, and air forces that each member state should contribute to uphold the Covenant); (2) The two countries endorse the method stipulated in Article 15, Paragraph 7 of the League of Nations Covenant, namely, if the Council is unable to obtain the unanimous acceptance of the report by the member states (excluding the parties to the dispute) attending the Council to resolve the dispute, each member state reserves the right to implement the actions deemed necessary to maintain fairness and justice. This article is based on the foundations recognized by the Locarno Treaties, such as the Franco-Polish Treaty and the Franco-Czech Treaty; (3) In the event of an act of aggression, it shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of Article 16, Paragraph 1 of the League of Nations Covenant, namely, if a member state engages in war, it shall be considered to have committed an act of war against all other member states of the League of Nations in fact. In this special situation, defensive measures may be taken automatically. The above are the main points of the Franco-Russian agreement. As for the technical details, they must be jointly discussed by Laval and Soviet Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov in Geneva before drafting the final text. This agreement is currently only signed by France and Russia. In the future, the Czech Republic and the Soviet Union will conclude a similar agreement. If other countries also adopt this method and conclude agreements with each other, it can become a universal mutual assistance system. (10th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Details to be Discussed Later</p>
<p>(Paris) This afternoon, Soviet Russian Ambassador to France Potemkin visited Foreign Minister Laval to discuss the conclusion of the Franco-Russian treaty. The opinions of the two governments on this treaty are already consistent. The various technical details will be discussed in person by Laval and Soviet Commissioner for Foreign Affairs Litvinov in Geneva. When Foreign Minister Laval goes to Russia, this treaty can be formally signed. (9th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>(Paris) Today, all Paris newspapers gladly welcomed the proposal that if Germany and Poland refuse to participate in the Eastern European Pact, France and Russia should conclude an agreement to replace it. The newspapers believe that Britain has now recognized Soviet Russia as a component in peaceful work and must praise the increased safety of the new mutual assistance agreement for Britain’s position in Asia. At the same time, France is currently speculating about the attitude that Britain will take at the Stresa conference. The newspapers believe that Italy's determined proposals at the Stresa conference are consistent with France's inclinations, and that Britain's trends will integrate with these trends. Le Petit Journal said that if the British delegation saw that a system based on the League of Nations cannot be established and that military alliances will inevitably be concluded to replace it, it would resolutely announce its support for this system. (10th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) This morning, various newspapers rushed to report that France and Soviet Russia have agreed on the principle of a "gentlemen's agreement." Le Journal and L'Écho de Paris reported on a military treaty based on Articles 10, 16, and 17 of the League of Nations Covenant, which will be signed after the Stresa conference and the League of Nations Council meeting this month in China. Le Journal stated that its details have not yet been drafted, but the principles have been agreed upon by both parties. The Eastern European Pact will become a military treaty, but it is still based on the League of Nations. The newspaper also commented on the regeneration of the League of Nations, saying that after this agreement is concluded, the League of Nations will be able to punish aggressor nations with rapid and practical automatic sanctions. France plans to stipulate arms limitations and use military treaties as guarantees. The Eastern European Pact will be signed first, containing compulsory military assistance, and all countries can participate. The French government also suggested amending Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant. L'Aube believes that the first step of the Eastern European Pact is to create a line of encirclement around Germany, while L'Écho de Paris stated that a Central European Pact will be concluded based on the same principles. Le Matin, regarding the amendment of Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, stated that the League of Nations was unable to decide who the aggressors were, and that automatic assistance would only take effect after the various countries restored their freedom of action. (10th National Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e29">Geneva Considers it a Clever Action <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) Here, the agreement that France and Russia negotiated and decided to formulate yesterday is regarded as a very clever action, which can have a very important impact at the Stresa conference. This move is intended to make the empty articles of the League of Nations Covenant effective. It seems that Italy will follow in France's footsteps. If so, the League of Nations Council meeting on April 15 will inevitably develop an interesting situation, and will put the British delegation in an unpleasant position. The artifice of consolidating the League of Nations by interpreting Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant based on mutual assistance will gain the powerful support of the Balkan Entente countries, the Little Entente countries, and the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula. (10th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>League of Nations Covenant Article 10: The Members of the League undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all Members of the League. In case of any such aggression or in case of any threat or danger of such aggression the Council shall advise upon the means by which this obligation shall be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Article 16: Should any Member of the League resort to war in disregard of its covenants under Articles 12, 13 or 15, it shall ipso facto be deemed to have committed an act of war against all other Members of the League, which hereby undertake immediately to subject it to the severance of all trade or financial relations, the prohibition of all intercourse between their nationals and the nationals of the covenant-breaking State, and the prevention of all financial, commercial or personal intercourse between the nationals of the covenant-breaking State and the nationals of any other State, whether a Member of the League or not. It shall be the duty of the Council in such case to recommend to the several governments concerned what effective military, naval or air force the Members of the League shall severally contribute to the armed forces to be used to protect the covenants of the League.</p>
<p>The Members of the League agree, further, that they will mutually support one another in the financial and economic measures which are taken under this Article, in order to minimise the loss and inconvenience resulting therefrom, and that they will mutually support one another in resisting any special measures aimed at one of their number by the covenant-breaking State, and that they will take the necessary steps to afford passage through their territory to the forces of any of the Members of the League which are co-operating to protect the covenants of the League.</p>
<p>Any Member of the League which has violated any covenant of the League may be declared to be no longer a Member of the League by a vote of the Council concurred in by the Representatives of all the other Members of the League represented thereon.</p>
<p>Article 17: In the event of a dispute between a Member of the League and a State which is not a Member of the League, or between States not Members of the League, the State or States not Members of the League shall be invited to accept the obligations of membership in the League for the purposes of such dispute, upon such conditions as the Council may deem just. If such invitation is accepted, the provisions of Articles 12 to 16 inclusive shall be applied with such modifications as may be deemed necessary by the Council.</p>
<p>Upon such invitation being given the Council shall immediately institute an inquiry into the circumstances of the dispute and recommend such action as may seem best and most effectual in the circumstances.</p>
<p>If a State so invited shall refuse to accept the obligations of membership in the League for the purposes of such dispute, and shall resort to war against a Member of the League, the provisions of Article 16 shall be applicable as against the State taking such action.</p>
<p>If both parties to the dispute when so invited refuse to accept the obligations of membership in the League for the purposes of such dispute, the Council may take such measures and make such recommendations as will prevent hostilities and will result in the settlement of the dispute.</p>

<p>(Paris) The French cabinet met for three hours last night and decided to grant Prime Minister Flandin and Foreign Minister Laval the authority to freely conclude non-aggression and mutual assistance conventions at the Stresa conference. The Stresa conference will open tomorrow. This convention will stipulate automatic military and economic adjudication to punish countries that disrupt European peace. According to reliable sources here, the Soviet Russian government supports the French plan, namely, that the signatory countries to this convention will meet anytime, anywhere, outside of Geneva in the event of a sudden attack, and decide on actions. According to the opinions of Soviet Russia and France, if this plan is passed by the Stresa conference, negotiations will still be carried out within the structure of the League of Nations. Officials declared before the French representatives departed that when Foreign Minister Laval comes to Moscow to visit, in addition to signing a general agreement within the scope of the League of Nations with Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov, he will also conclude a Franco-Russian mutual assistance convention. According to a telegram from Rome, Prime Minister Mussolini does not want to have any concrete expressions before the opening of the Stresa conference. (10th National Telegram)</p>

<p>(Paris) On the eve of the Stresa conference, the chief editor of Le Petit Parisien discussed international politics and expressed his opinion: "One nation has been defeated and is eager to recover what it has lost, so it is preparing for war with all its strength.

May Mussolini, MacDonald, Simon, Flandin, and Laval all remember this." Le Petit Journal stated that Italy's concept is bold and firm and should coincide with France's inclinations, and that Britain's inclination should be in harmony with Italy and France. L'Ére Nouvelle said, "If Britain is unwilling to accept restrictions to guarantee European public safety, although it is regrettable, if European countries must establish a strong line of resistance to cope with Germany's future aggression, it is hoped that Britain will not come out and obstruct it."

<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Simon today gave a speech in the House of Commons, revealing for the first time the details of Germany's request for expansion of its army, navy, and air force. Simon stated that German leader Hitler recently suggested during talks with him in Berlin that he wanted to equip the army with thirty-six divisions totaling 550,000 men, and also demanded that Germany should have weapons equal to those of other countries. As for the navy and air force, with some reservations, Germany requested that its navy's total tonnage should be equal to 35% of Britain's, and its air force should be equal to that of Britain and France. Germany is prepared to accept a military inspection system, but only on the condition that all countries accept it simultaneously. If Germany's status cannot be equal, then it is still unwilling to return to the League of Nations. Simon also acknowledged for the first time that Hitler had requested the restoration of territories lost in the peace treaty. He also expressed Britain's disappointment to Hitler because the opinions of all parties were difficult to reconcile. As for what measures Britain will take in the Stresa Conference, the Foreign Secretary said that the government has not yet determined its attitude towards the talks that Lord Privy Seal Eden had in the capitals of various European countries. Germany has made it clear that it is unwilling to participate in the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, and even less willing to participate with Russia. However, Germany is willing to join if countries related to the Eastern European issue sign non-aggression treaties stipulating mutual consultation in the event of a risk of aggression. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Simon today briefly outlined in the House of Commons the talks he and Eden had in Berlin, and the talks Eden later had in Moscow, Warsaw, and Prague.</p>
<p>Germany Opposes Eastern European Pact: Says Hitler told him that Germany does not want to sign an Eastern European Pact containing mutual assistance and including Lithuania in any non-aggression pact, and especially opposes concluding a mutual assistance agreement with Soviet Russia. He advocates that countries involved in the Eastern European issue should conclude non-aggression pacts, with clauses attached for mutual consultation in the event of aggression.</p>
<p>No Objection to Central European Pact: Although Hitler has no objection to the Central European Pact, it is expected that great difficulties will arise regarding the clause that it will not interfere in German-Austrian relations. However, Germany is prepared to consider this issue when other governments reach a compromise on the establishment of this pact.</p>
<p>Requests Expansion of Army, Navy, and Air Force: Mr. Hitler also said that Germany must have thirty-six divisions, with a maximum troop strength of 550,000 men, including one division of the National Socialist Party's guards and armed police. He also said that Germany currently has all kinds of weapons that other countries have, and if a certain country stops manufacturing a certain weapon, then Germany does not want to manufacture it either. Later, regarding the naval issue, Mr. Hitler requested that Germany must have at least 35% of Britain's tonnage. As for the air force, if Soviet Russia's air force does not change, then the air forces of Britain, France, and Germany must be equal.</p>
<p>Does Not Forget Old Territories: Germany agrees to the Sky Pact under discussion. Germany is willing to make an agreement on the limitation of armaments that contains prohibition, but this kind of agreement must be applied equally to all countries. Mr. Hitler also told him that if Germany is placed in a position of inferiority for a long time, then it does not want to participate in the work of the League of Nations. Germany currently has no colonies, which is one aspect of its inferior status. He and Eden did not approve of certain opinions expressed by Hitler and German cabinet members regarding certain points. When the talks were over, he stated to Hitler that it was disappointing that such great difficulties had arisen in reaching a compromise.</p>
<p>Russia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia's Positions: Simon continued, saying that Eden had learned in Moscow that the Soviet Russian government was willing to promote a European security system based on the principles of the League of Nations as planned in the London Communiqué of February 3. The Soviet Union had firmly stated that the Eastern European Pact was not intended to encircle any country, but to provide equal security for all countries, and believed that the participation of Germany and Poland in the pact was the best solution to the problem. In Warsaw, Eden was explained to by Polish Foreign Minister Beck that Poland must maintain a state of tranquility on the borders of Germany and Russia through existing treaties, and asked whether any new proposals would enhance or disturb the tranquility that had already been achieved. Beck and Czech Foreign Minister Beneš both hoped that the Stresa Conference would advance the Central European Pact and lead to its establishment.</p>
<p>Simon concluded by saying that the Stresa Conference will be followed by a meeting of the League of Nations Executive Council convened by France next Monday. Simon refused to make any statements regarding the government's foreign policy before the Stresa Conference, but Prime Minister MacDonald has agreed to choose a day in the House of Commons after the Easter holiday to debate foreign affairs (Reuters, 9th).</p>
<p>Britain's Attitude Remains Ambiguous</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Simon's speech in the House of Commons yesterday was quite vague. It is still unknown what attitude Britain will take towards the various issues that the Stresa Conference and the League of Nations Executive Council should discuss. As a result, the newspapers feel uneasy. The Conservative Morning Post stated, "When will this explanation end? It is truly something we do not know. But for the sake of Britain, rather than engaging in mediation that is laborious and fruitless, why not decide on an attitude and resolutely cooperate with countries that safeguard public safety?" The Liberal News Chronicle stated, "The general impression is that the British government's policy to be adopted lacks clear views. It is still only capable of gathering information for future negotiations, and there is no further preparation. This is probably what makes people most uneasy. Moreover, whether the government can make suggestions regarding the European situation, whether it can accept a more practical commitment to the collective security system, and request the House of Commons to approve it, there is no mention of any of this, which is what we regret most." In addition, the Daily Telegraph and the Daily Express both expressed opposition to Germany's demand for the return of its former colonies (Havas, 10th).</p>
<p>Statement from Berlin</p>
<p>(Berlin) British Foreign Secretary Simon's speech in the House of Commons regarding the discussions in Berlin, Moscow, Warsaw, and Prague is currently being carefully considered by the local authorities. It must be released to the newspapers after consideration. Political circles now feel that Simon did not make a full and practical statement regarding the positive aspects of the Berlin discussions and Germany's willingness to assist in European pacification. In addition, the Foreign Communications stated, with official authorization, that Germany is prepared to participate in an armaments pact that provides equal rights, obligations, and security to participating countries (Reuters, 9th).</p>

<p>Munich Today is the 70th birthday of Ludendorff, the only surviving old general in Germany. His former subordinates gathered at Ludendorff's villa near Munich to hold a parade in celebration. Since 8:00 AM, more than 2,000 people gathered near Ludendorff's villa, many of whom were retired officers wearing the German military uniforms from before the European War. Before long, the current Army Minister von Blomberg and Army Commander-in-Chief von Fritsch also arrived to congratulate Ludendorff. General von Blomberg then addressed the crowd, saying that Germany has now implemented conscription, so the organization of the new German army is closer to the old military system before the war. The old German army, both before the war and during the European War, was trained and guided by Ludendorff, and the new army in the future will also take Ludendorff's spirit as a model. General Ludendorff, wearing his old general's uniform, accepted the salute of the parade participants, standing straight with his chest out, his heroic spirit undiminished from those years. He also gave a brief speech to the public, first thanking them, and then saying that he was honored to wear his old military uniform again. Mr. Ludendorff then recounted the deeds of his old comrades who sacrificed themselves for the country in the European War, saying that their spirit of sacrifice is the source of racial freedom and self-defense, and the cornerstone of today's great nation. Mr. Ludendorff concluded by saying that the country has now implemented conscription, and this universal military service is the foundation of the German people's true survival (National Telegram, 9th).</p>

House of Representatives Re-Passes the War Profits Cancellation Act <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) The Naval Engineering Program Act, which was passed by the House of Representatives on March 27, was passed by the Senate today and is now being sent to President Roosevelt for signature. The act stipulates naval engineering funds of 38 million US dollars, of which 26 million US dollars will be used for naval bases on the west coast and Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, and 10 million US dollars will be used to build floating docks. In addition, several million US dollars are needed to build a submarine base and powder magazine in the Panama Canal Zone (Reuters, 9th).</p>
<p>(Washington) The Army Budget Act for the current fiscal year, which lists expenditures of $401,998,170 and approves a 40% increase in the size of the standing army, from 118,700 to 165,000, was previously passed by both the House and Senate and has now been signed into law by President Roosevelt (Havas, 9th).</p>
<p>(Washington) The House of Representatives today passed McKissick's War Profits Cancellation Act, giving the god of war a major blow in the United States. The act passed by a vote of 365 to 15. Beforehand, opponents of the original proposal had forced the Military Affairs Committee to delete the point authorizing the President to implement conscription during wartime. However, according to the current form passed, the President still has broad powers to requisition domestic manpower and financial resources. In addition to being able to tax excessive war profits at 100%, the act also has the following points: (1) After the United States declares war, the government can control all prices. (2) All industries must apply for licenses during wartime, and the distribution of major goods must be managed by the government. (3) It is forbidden to send American people to any foreign country to fight, except in cases where the United States is in danger of being invaded. (4) The President is authorized to order the suspension of operations of all domestic securities and commodities exchanges when necessary. The act has now been sent to the Senate, which is planning to add further restrictions. The Senate Munitions Investigating Committee is also studying limiting war profits for ordinary businesses to no more than 3% of the original capital. For personal war profits, the Senate may limit each person to no more than 8,000 US dollars per year. The army opposes this drastic move, fearing that munitions merchants' capital will★■■■★■■★■■★★, and reconciliation between the two sides may be quite difficult. In addition, the Senate also introduced a bill on wartime today. The proposers are Republican Knight and Democratic Clark. Knight's proposal advocates authorizing the President to refuse to issue passports to American people for travel abroad during wartime. Clark's proposal stipulates that anyone who lends money to belligerent countries to enable them to purchase goods should be sentenced to imprisonment and heavy fines (National News Agency, 9th).</p>

<p>(Manila) Crown Princess Dayang-Dayang of the Sulu Kingdom is now requesting President Roosevelt to help her establish a claim to the ownership of fourteen islands off the coast of British North Borneo. One of the islands, named Siamil, has been leased by the British authorities to the Japanese to establish a fish cannery. Americans here do not pay attention to this request, thinking that the Sulu Province of the Philippines has more than a dozen islands, whose residents are Muslims, totaling about 175,000 people. The Crown Princess has the power to rule them, which is enough to console her, so why seek other things? The sovereignty of the islands in the Sulu Sea and the British North Borneo area has long been resolved by the treaties signed by Moro, Britain, and the United States. However, Dayang-Dayang said that the Stimson Treaty of a few years ago only concerned the Turtle Islands and did not resolve the ownership of the fourteen islands, so she is still the owner of the islands (Reuters, 9th).</p>
<h3 id="e45">US Economic Survey Group Meets with Japanese Finance and Commerce Ministers <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) After meeting with the US Economic Survey Group on the 9th, Finance Minister Takahashi told reporters that the survey group asked about methods to stabilize the world economy. I told them that stabilizing the world economy and solving the war debt problem were prerequisites. Because they did not want to talk about political issues, they stopped talking about this issue. The true purpose of the US survey group seems to be to fully investigate the economic situation in China. In the past, the knowledge of European and American countries about China was only obtained by a few foreigners or missionaries, which was very superficial. Now that the survey groups are successively going to China to investigate the actual situation, it is indeed a meaningful thing (Japan United News, 10th).</p>

<h3 id="e50">Initial Draft of Bankruptcy Law Announced <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The initial draft of the Bankruptcy Law of the Republic of China, drafted by the Civil Law Committee of the Legislative Yuan, has been completed, with a total of four chapters, ten sections, and 160 articles. It was announced on the afternoon of the 10th to solicit opinions, with a deadline of May 10th, and will be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion in June. The main points of the law include: (1) The cause of bankruptcy adopts a comprehensive doctrine. (2) The declaration of bankruptcy adopts the application doctrine. (3) The bankruptcy estate adopts the expansion doctrine. (4) Reconciliation and bankruptcy cases are exclusively under the jurisdiction of the court where the debtor's or bankrupt's business is located. If there is no business location, the court where the debtor resides has jurisdiction. (5) A request for reconciliation must be approved or rejected before a bankruptcy request is made, and is made by a ruling that cannot be appealed. (6) The terms of reconciliation are freely negotiated by the debtor and creditors, and there are no strengthened regulations on the number and timing of repayments. If the debtor has malicious intent, they will not be allowed to enjoy the benefits of reconciliation. (7) If a bankruptcy creditor has been reduced in repayment through conciliation or bankruptcy proceedings, the part of the debt that has not been repaid is deemed to be extinguished. (8) Debtors who commit fraud in reconciliation, bankrupts who commit fraud in bankruptcy, or who have committed specific criminal acts within one year before bankruptcy, or who do not fulfill specific obligations prescribed by this law or commit fraudulent acts during the bankruptcy proceedings, shall be punished. According to the Chairman of the Civil Law Committee, Fu Bingchang, the points in which this law differs from the bankruptcy laws of various countries include: (1) German bankruptcy law is a pure law, while this is a cooperative civil and commercial bankruptcy law. (2) It maintains our country's inherent good habits. The main points are: A. Reconciliation allows the application of courts or chambers of commerce. Reconciliation is handled with the consent of both parties. B. The bankruptcy law of each country stipulates that debt distribution adopts a proportional method, while this law adopts a situational domination. C. It distinguishes between good-faith bankruptcy and malicious bankruptcy. Those who are in good faith because the reason is unfortunate are slightly forgiven, while those who are in bad faith have strict measures to punish them. As for the previous remaining debts, in the bankruptcy laws of various countries, such as Germany, when the judgment is made, in addition to the bankrupt then liquidating their existing payments to the creditors, a certificate must be issued for the remaining debts, which is to be collected when the debtor has the ability. The UK also has the same provisions at the time of judgment. This law has already stipulated that when the official announces bankruptcy, it will be liquidated according to the existing ones, so that the bankrupt will have the opportunity and spirit to engage in business again. This law is based on the spirit of civil law and our country's inherent habits and needs, striving for simplicity in order to be applied. During the opinion solicitation period, if all parties have opinions to contribute, they will be especially valued in order to gather the wisdom of the public (Special Dispatch, 10th).</p>

Mutual concessions may be possible before the strike is realized. The railway situation has also improved. All these news have a good impact on the market. When the securities market opened this morning, most prices were unchanged, with occasional slight increases, mostly limited to fractional numbers. Trading was still active in the first half hour, then fell. After an hour, most of the opening prices could still be maintained, but the sentiment was not very strong.

<p>Since the financial panic last year in our country, the sound of inflation has been very loud in the market. At the end of last month, after the government issued 100 million yuan in financial bonds, this sound became even louder, causing the bidding price to skyrocket. Those who own assets either hoard cash or try to exchange for goods to avoid the worry of freezing and starvation, spending their days in fear. After the Ministry of Finance dispelled the rumors, this trend subsided slightly. It can be said that the masses were troubling themselves unnecessarily. It is important to know that in our country's current situation, there is no possibility of adopting new policies. However, the concentration of floating capital in cities without engaging in production is ultimately not a blessing for the country. Occasionally, those who are interested in production enterprises are often troubled by not knowing the tricks and having difficulty in designing, selecting, purchasing, installing, and managing machinery, which leads to interruptions. In fact, if a certain production enterprise is determined, there are already agencies in the country that can handle the above-mentioned problems, such as:</p>
<p>The Shanghai Tongji Engineering Company is organized by experts in various fields of engineering and specializes in solving the above-mentioned problems for domestic industrialists. It has been in operation for four years, and it has handled countless cases in various provinces and cities. It is diligent in its work and has a very good reputation. Therefore, the products of government agencies such as the Engineering Research Institute of the Academia Sinica, the Electrical Machinery Manufacturing Plant of the Construction Committee, and businesses such as the Housheng Machinery Factory are all entrusted to it as the exclusive manager. Recently, it is undertaking the entire machinery project of the Sichuan Kaiji Alkali Manufacturing Company, the weaving workshop of the Shou County Women's Vocational School in Anhui, and the large and small cabinet projects of the Gongxian Arsenal Branch Factory, which are quite busy. Those interested in production enterprises who entrust the entire project, design, etc., can avoid all difficulties and achieve satisfactory results.</p>

<h3 id="e99">The Northeast After the Conclusion of the Sino-Soviet Railway Deal <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— (Changchun Correspondence)</p>
<p>After a year and nine months of repeated negotiations and countless twists and turns between Japan and the Soviet Union regarding the sale of the Sino-Soviet Railway, a formal agreement has finally been signed. Moreover, the first installment of 23.3 million Japanese yen was received on the day of the signing. The remaining payments are scheduled to be made in installments. Most of the important Soviet personnel on the Sino-Soviet Railway are preparing to hand over their positions, and their families have already returned to their home country. The number of Soviet personnel on the railway is approximately 7,000, and the first batch of Japanese personnel sent to take over amounts to 5,000. Although it is currently said that as long as they are willing to work diligently and do not hinder the so-called "Manchukuo," they can continue to stay, in reality, it is feared that it will be difficult to allow their continued presence. Not only will it be difficult for the majority of Soviet railway employees to remain, but also many of the ordinary Soviet merchants, totaling more than 35,000, will have to pack their bags and return home. Although the influence of the Soviet Union in the Northeast may not be completely eliminated, at least it will no longer be able to control the real economic power of the Northeast. In the future, it will be in a passive position. The area surrounded by the Songhua and Nen Rivers is the richest region, with approximately 87.22 million hectares of arable land. Currently, only about 20% of this land has been cultivated, which is only 17.8 million hectares. This area is the largest source of revenue for the Sino-Soviet Railway and the most important region of the Northeast. In terms of production, considering only agricultural products, soybeans account for about 36%, millet for 20%, sorghum for 15%, wheat for 12%, and corn for 7%. In short, the Northeast's special products largely come from the Northeast region. Although the Greater and Lesser Khingan Ranges are undeveloped and unsuitable for cultivation, they contain ancient, untouched forests covering at least 190,000 to 200,000 square kilometers, with timber reserves exceeding 100 million cubic feet. The tree species include coniferous trees such as Korean pine, Ezo spruce, fir, and larch, as well as broad-leaved trees such as mountain pear, bodhi, poplar, cottonwood, Qinggang oak, and birch. Currently, logging is mostly concentrated near Jilin and along the Sino-Soviet Railway, accounting for only about 10% of the total forest area.</p>
<p>Animal husbandry is also very promising. The areas related to the Sino-Soviet Railway have a total of 9 million head of sheep and horses. The central region for animal husbandry is the Hulunbuir area. The quality of the wool is very good, and the developing Japanese wool industry has a particular need for wool from this area. Currently, the trading centers for livestock hides and furs are Qiqihar, Hailar, and Manchuria. Exports are mostly concentrated in Vladivostok. Now that the Sino-Soviet Railway is under Japanese control, these globally traded items will be exported eastward to Chongjin and absorbed westward by Dalian.</p>
<p>The Northeast is also rich in mineral resources. In terms of those already mined, Zhalainuoer produces lignite. The coal produced in Muling, Heligang, Mishan, Dongning, Ganhe, and other places is of excellent quality, not inferior to the products of Fushun. The reserves in these locations alone amount to 250 million tons. According to a certain expert's survey, the coal reserves in the Northeast are at least 30 billion tons (approximately one-third of the total coal reserves in Japan). Of particular interest is placer gold. The main streams and tributaries of the Ergune River in Heilongjiang all produce considerable quantities, which is also urgently needed by Japan. Although the reserves of other mineral resources such as silver, copper, lead, and aluminum have not been clearly investigated, they are not insignificant. The salt lake reserves in the Hulunbuir area are even more abundant, truly "inexhaustible." The Northeast's natural resources are richer than those in South Manchuria. Now that the Japanese have succeeded in the transfer of the Sino-Soviet Railway, they can freely exploit them.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, Japan's railway encroachment in Manchuria has achieved alarming success. Now that the Sino-Soviet Railway has been sold, it will naturally gain even more momentum. However, on the other hand, the industries run by local people are in a slump. For example, the weaving industry in Harbin has almost completely shut down. Previously, there were more than 150 domestic factories in Harbin, with an annual output value of approximately 10 million. Now, only about 30 factories continue to operate, and they are all in a state of anxiety, unable to continue. Seeing such abundant resources being taken over by others while they themselves are starving and freezing, people here feel that it will be even more difficult to run businesses after the Sino-Soviet Railway deal is concluded.

<h3 id="e100">Amidst Talk of Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation, Jilin Timber is Imported into China. Tianjin Alone Needs 300,000 Piculs Annually; Illegal Timber Businesses are Active. <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Changchun Correspondence: Amidst talk of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, the economic relationship between North China and the puppet state, centered on Tianjin, is gradually becoming closer. In the past year, more than 1,000 carts of mats have been imported from the Tangshan area to the puppet state. There has also been a considerable increase in millet and wheat from Shanxi and Chahar. Starting this year, Jilin timber has gradually been imported into North China, showing a significant upward trend. Since the September 18th Incident, most of the construction timber in North China has been imported from coastal areas of the Soviet Union. Recently, due to construction in the Soviet Union, timber imports to North China have gradually decreased. Jilin timber has taken this opportunity to enter the market and is gradually becoming popular. Currently, there are ongoing discussions between the Jilin Timber Industry and the Tianjin Timber Association, planning to import Jilin timber into North China in large quantities. It is estimated that Tianjin alone needs about 300,000 piculs per year. The progress of this trade is currently attracting the attention of those involved. (Northeast News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e101">The Reorganization of Wang Bingxiao's Unit of the Yutian Militia <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Before the Security Team under Feng Shoupeng and others in Yutian County were transferred for reorganization, incidents of discord occurred repeatedly between the team and the local illegal militia. The local people suffered terribly. The destruction was particularly severe in the battle of Yuhong Bridge. Therefore, the residents of the county, especially those who were well-off, completely abandoned their homes and fled. The shops in the suburbs also closed one after another, making it almost a dead city. The authorities, intending to punish the team, contacted the Japanese through the Jiji Mi District Commissioner and the "War Zone Cleanup Committee." After a year of effort, the team was finally transferred for reorganization. Except for those who fled with their weapons, the rest are still able to maintain order. As for the reorganization of the illegal militia in Yutian, it must also be carried out. When Yin Rugeng was in charge of this matter in Yutian, in addition to those who had been disbanded in accordance with the order, the Wang Chengzhu unit and the Wang Bingxiao unit of the Yuhong Bridge militia stubbornly refused to comply. In particular, the Wang Chengzhu unit was the most unruly. They had opened fire with the Zhou Yuying unit of the Security Team. Due to the disparity in numbers and the terrain, they led their troops to break through and flee to the territory of Zunhua County. Wang Chengzhu himself was later captured by the militia in that county and sent back to Yutian. The remnants who fled into Zunhua are still stubbornly resisting in the Liuxing Ridge Mountains, with about 300 people and complete weapons. However, due to the tight encirclement by the Security Team and the militia, they have no way to break through. According to a telephone call from Zunhua this morning (6th), the rebel group originally intended to flee south to Qian'an, but since they cannot succeed, they are now planning to flee to the outside of the pass. Wang Bingxiao took the initiative to express to County Magistrate Zhao and Team Leader Zhou last night (5th) that he was willing to comply with the order for reorganization. This morning (6th), he began to disband. Zhao and Zhou immediately reported to the public office and the provincial government this afternoon (6th). After the unit is resolved, the reorganization of the illegal militia in Yutian County can be considered to have come to an end. (6th)</p>

<p>Zhou Jintang, the chief of the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau in Luodian Town, Baoshan County, took office on the 8th of this month. Unexpectedly, after Chief Zhou took office, he dismissed all the existing police chiefs Zhou Fan and all the more than 20 police officers, and replaced them with new police officers brought by Chief Zhou. After being dismissed, the old police officers, considering that they were still in training, were suddenly dismissed and their livelihoods were precarious. Yesterday (10th), they prepared a document to petition various agencies such as the district party headquarters, the district office, and the chamber of commerce. They also decided to jointly petition the county party headquarters and the county government this morning, requesting that the director be ordered to withdraw the dismissal order.</p>

<p>Fuda Money Exchange and Wanquanyu Tongji Sauce Garden in this city were founded by Jiang Yongfan and Jiang Jingsheng, who have been in business for more than ten years. Because the Jiang brothers are honest and prudent, Fuda Money Exchange has a particularly large amount of deposits. Wanquanyu Tongji Sauce Garden also has a considerable number of small depositors. In recent years, the garden has established many branches in Gongji, Heji, Yiji, Yongji, and Zhitang, and its business has been extremely prosperous, holding the leading position in the county's sauce and wine industry. Recently, due to rural bankruptcy and the decline of all industries, Fuda Money Exchange has been unable to maintain its operations due to financial difficulties. Wanquanyu Tongji and its branches have also suffered heavy losses and have been unable to support themselves. Suddenly, at 10:00 AM on the 7th of this month, lawyers Qian Langxi and Wang Kunfu announced the liquidation. The news shocked all sectors. It is reported that the total amount of various creditors is about 400,000 yuan. Jiang Yongfan, who also served as the manager and chairman of Taicang Bank, resigned on the 6th. The bank convened a board meeting that evening and decided to hire Gong Minqiu as the chairman and Shao Menggang as the manager.</p>

<p>Fengjing Songbang is an area where waterways are divided and bandits roam. Robberies are often heard in the vicinity. At about 2:00 AM on the 6th, more than ten bandits speaking a mixed dialect suddenly came to the area, armed with shoulder poles, knives, and flashlights. They broke into the home of Shen Shaotang and robbed him. Shaotang resisted slightly, and the bandits attacked him in groups, cutting his left forehead, causing blood to flow profusely. They then looted to their hearts' content and went to the homes of Shen Yuanrong, Shen Xiuqin, Shen Jinlian, Shen Guiting, Shen Anqi, and Shen Shaoqin, robbing seven families in a row. For about two hours, they stole a lot of silver, cloth, jewelry, and clothing. The bandits carried their loot and escaped along the original route of Sanxiantang. The victims have each filed a list of losses and reported it to the Second Branch, which has forwarded it to the County Public Security Bureau to request the arrest of the thieves and the recovery of the stolen goods. The injured Shen Shaotang went to seek medical treatment on his own.</p>

<p>Quan Lianfu, a resident of Chijiaheng in the west suburbs of this city, abused his daughter-in-law, Ms. Liu, and falsely accused her of infidelity. He incited his son, Quan Wangcai, who was working in Shanghai, to return to Songjiang. Without asking the reason, he beat Ms. Liu, who committed suicide out of resentment. After the family of the deceased, Liu Meichu, reported the case to the bureau and requested the prosecutor's office to examine the injuries, fill out the death certificate, and propose an investigation, it was determined that the defendant Quan Wangcai had caused minor injury to his wife, which constituted a crime under Article 293, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. His coercion caused his wife, Quan Liu, to commit suicide by taking poison, which constituted a suspicion under Article 290, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Also, according to Article 43, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, the defendant Quan Lianfu was suspected of committing the same offense. A public prosecution was filed with the Criminal Court, and a public hearing is scheduled for 9:00 AM on the 13th.</p>

<p>Shuigen, the son of Xie Xia in Caijiawei, Chefang, had a history of hemoptysis. In the first month of this year, he returned home drunk with his neighbors Zhou Agen and Zhou Boying. He fell once on the way. He suddenly died the next day. Xie Xia then filed a complaint with the local court, alleging that Shuigen's death was caused by being beaten by Zhou Agen and others. The court sent prosecutor Yang An and a coroner to the village to examine the body, but there were no injuries. Xie Xia refused to accept this and had the body transported to the city. The court then sent Judge Xia Jinglu and forensic doctor Chen to re-examine the body outside Pingmen, but there were still no injuries. The court then ruled that Zhou Agen and Zhou Boying would not be prosecuted. Afterwards, Xie Xia filed an appeal with the High Court, which was rejected. Unable to vent her anger, she led people to Zhou Boying's house to make trouble from time to time. Zhou Aen and others then filed a counter-suit in court for obstructing freedom. The court repeatedly summoned Xie Xia without success. On the 9th, the court sent bailiffs Zhong Muzi and Hou Jinggui and assistant Zhang Kuaizi, hired a boat to Chefang, and met with the patrol chief and three police officers. Guided by Zhou Yinxiang, Zhou Aen's uncle, they changed boats to Caijiawei to make the arrest. Unexpectedly, as soon as the boat arrived, a crowd of villagers had gathered on the shore. Without asking the reason, they beat and tied up the two bailiffs and one assistant. The public security police and boatmen all fled. Later, boatman Li Gengsheng came to the city on the morning of the 10th to report to the court. The court immediately sent a secretary general to lead bailiffs, accompanied by police officers sent by the Public Security Bureau, to Chefang by speedboat to rescue the two bailiffs and one assistant. It is reported that bailiff Hou Jinggui was the most seriously injured and his life may be in danger. However, Xie Xia suddenly surrendered herself on the afternoon of the 10th. At the same time, Xia Kunquan was arrested outside Fengmen. After interrogation, they were both taken into custody.</p>

<p>Zhou Rongquan, a villager in Dunshang Village, Tangtou'an, Er'ertu, Beiting, set up a mechanism to manufacture poison pills at home and made a lot of profit. In July of last year, he was defrauded of more than 1,000 yuan by Changjiao Rongquan and others. Because the spoils were not divided equally, someone reported it to the Public Security Bureau. The village chief Jiang Yingsheng (i.e., Jiang Juchang), who had privately handled the case, and Zheng Chao, who received the money, and Chen Quanfa, the boatman, were arrested and sent to the Zhenjiang Garrison Command. Jiang Yingsheng was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment, and Zheng Chao and Chen Quanfa were sent back to the original county for retrial. However, the main culprit, Zhou Rongquan, took his wife and children and hid in Suzhou after the incident, living freely under the alias Zhou Shichu, and secretly continued his old business. His manufacturing mechanism had been moved to Mudu in the suburbs of Suzhou (some say outside Kuatang). Zhou himself traveled in and out of Suzhou city and countryside, and his whereabouts were mysterious. The day before yesterday (8th), Zhong Jihe, the detective captain of the Public Security Bureau of this county, learned of the previous situation and sent detectives Yan Zengfu and Wu Zhengrong, the police chief of the county government, to Suzhou to arrest him. Zhou Rongquan was arrested at the entrance of the Wenquan Bathhouse at Shilukou outside Banmen. Eighteen packs of red medicine powder, a roll of cellophane, and more than 300 empty boxes of Butterfly Brand poison pills were found in Zhou's home at No. 151 Qimen Main Street. He was taken to the Third Branch, transferred to the Public Security Bureau for detention, and escorted to Wuxi yesterday for trial.</p>

<p>Jiang Benpu, the captain of the Second Platoon of the tax police stationed in Yilin Town, often used the name of smuggling suppression to send plainclothes teams to Daxu Village in the west of the town, threatening the villagers with guns. Because the banditry was rampant in the area, the villagers were on guard day and night. When they saw this, they suspected that they were bandits and were extremely alarmed. A large number of tax police then arrived, and the villagers began to calm down and requested an investigation. Unexpectedly, the captain ignored them and falsely claimed that the villagers were resisting. He forcibly confiscated five self-defense guns, beat and injured 18 good citizens, including six who were seriously injured, and arrested more than 30 people, extorting huge sums of money. The local villagers were extremely angry. It is reported that they have sent a telegram to the Supervision Office of the Ministry of Finance of the Wuhan Headquarters, requesting strict punishment.</p>

<p>Special Boat to Cross the River</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai from the capital, Mr. He completed a series of receptions from various parties. Yesterday morning, at 11:15 AM, he took a small tugboat from the Jiangpu Bureau from the South Bund Pier of the New Customs to cross the river. Yu Ming, the director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Secretary Zhao Tiezhang, Tang Shixuan, the secretary of the Municipal Government representing Mayor Wu, former Commander Qi Kaixin and his wife, Aisha, the former member of the Xinjiang Construction Association, Guo Weiping, the senator of the Border Affairs Group of the General Staff, and three or four Turkish residents also took the small tugboat to cross the river to see him off.

<p>Remarks Before Departure</p>
<p>Before his departure, Mr. He told a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency that he would take the Conte Verde to Port Said in Egypt, then change ships to Connie, then take a train for one day.

Sir Fubpei was the first Turkish charge d'affaires to China and was promoted to envoy. Four years ago, there was an embassy in Shanghai, but it was canceled due to Turkey's implementation of a downsizing policy. It is not known who will be sent when it is restored in the future.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, Kong Xiangxi telegraphed Yu Xuezhong, the Chairman of Hebei Province, yesterday, requesting a strict investigation because the Shanghai newspapers reported that Hu Yuanhui, the Director of the Hebei Provincial Construction Department, had talked in Beijing about the appalling abuses discovered at the Changyuan construction site. The original telegram is as follows: Chairman Yu Xiaohou, please review, confidential. After reading the Shanghai newspapers, Director Hu Yuanhui talked about the appalling abuses discovered in the Changyuan construction site during the Huang Jianxiang period. Checking river disaster control is a matter of life and death for the people, and the Central Government is deeply concerned. Even in times of financial distress, huge sums of money have been repeatedly issued. Since the water conservancy has been under the jurisdiction of the Economic Commission, I have been particularly concerned about river control projects. A responsible person has been sent to supervise the work, and international experts have been hired to make detailed plans. The Central Government has sent people to visit from time to time. The matter is so important that it has to be handled with caution. If what Director Hu said is true, it should be reported so that a thorough investigation can be carried out. It is hoped that a detailed report will be forwarded so that a thorough investigation can be made and dealt with strictly to uphold the national law. I also hope for a telegram in reply. Kong Xiangxi respectfully bows.</p>

<p>Shanghai industrialists and merchants, concerned about the approaching end-of-April maturity dates for long-term loans, requested the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to ask the money trade for accommodations. The Money Trade Association held an executive committee meeting yesterday, and aside from notifying all firms in the trade, they principally approved the discounting of commercial acceptance bills. The Bankers Association has contacted the Central Bank to announce interest rates. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Money Trade Association Executive Committee Meeting</p>
<p>The Money Trade Association held its 37th executive committee meeting of the second term at 2 PM yesterday at the association's meeting room on Ningbo Road. Attendees included Qin Runqing, Wang Huailian, Qian Yuansheng, Zheng Bingquan, Liu Wuqiao, Sheng Xiaoshan, Li Shoushan, and Zhang Mengzhou. Secretary-General Qin Xiqing was present as an observer. The meeting was chaired by Qin Runxiang, and after formal greetings, the following items were reported: (1) Minutes of the previous meeting; (2) Letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce forwarding the instruction from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau regarding the Central Political Conference resolution to protect people's property and business freedom; (3) Various reports on the reserve fund. Items for discussion included: (1) The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce's letter regarding requests from factories and shops for accommodating methods for long-term notes nearing maturity, before the implementation of small-scale credit mortgages; (2) The Committee for Promoting National Goods' request to postpone fixed-term loans. A combined resolution was reached that each firm had already considered the situation and handled things as usual regarding long-term loans coming due, being repaid, extended, or newly issued, and a letter had been sent to notify all firms in the trade. (3) Regarding setting the date for the internal market conference, it was decided to be at 2 PM on April 25th. (4) Regarding commercial acceptance bill discounting, a principle approval was reached, and all firms in the trade would be notified to accept such instruments as much as possible for their regular business clients. The meeting adjourned around 3 PM.</p>
<p>Each Firm Decides on Maximum Flexibility</p>
<p>The money trade's long-term loans to industry and commerce were originally divided into three periods each year: end of March, end of September, and now end of April, end of October, each period being six months. With the end of April approaching, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, upon receiving requests from various industries, sent a letter to the Money Trade Association for accommodations. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency inquired with the money trade yesterday and learned that Article 29 of the trade's regulations states: "For fixed-term loans, debtors should repay on time. If the debtor wishes to repay before maturity, they must obtain the money shop's consent. However, if the money shop deems it necessary, it may also recover the loan from the debtor at any time with the debtor's consent, even before maturity." Now, each money shop has decided to provide flexibility for maturing loans within possible limits, in order to fulfill the purpose of supporting industry and commerce.</p>
<p>Banks Implement Bill Discounting</p>
<p>After the silk and satin trade association implemented commercial acceptance bills on April 1st, the Silk Industry Bank was the first to undertake discounting. After the Bankers Association passed six principles for implementation, it coordinated with the Central Bank to announce the discount rate daily while also handling rediscounting to facilitate the flow of funds between the banking and money trades. The Central Bank has largely resolved any issues with this approach, and all banks agree on the discounting principles as part of their business. Implementation will begin as soon as coordination is complete, resolved by the end of April.</p>
<p>Three Banks Exert Themselves to Relieve All Industries</p>
<p>With the end of April approaching, the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications have decided to set aside substantial funds, similar to the methods used before the industry account closures in 1934, for interbank lending between the banking and money trades, in order to indirectly relieve all industries. At the same time, the Bankers Association has raised 2.5 million yuan for small credit loans. If the government can allocate another 2.5 million yuan, totaling 5 million yuan, a bank syndicate will be organized to implement the plan. Otherwise, the banks will independently organize the syndicate. Implementation is resolved before the end of April to provide relief to industry and commerce. Detailed measures have been drafted and are being processed by a subcommittee.</p>

Next, the health authorities of the two concessions reported that the prevention results within the concessions last year were also good, with no epidemic. The methods used were still compulsory vaccination and the provision of free tap water to the poor, which proved most effective. Subsequently, Director Wu Liande of the Port Quarantine Administration, Director Cheng Shuzhen of the Health Experiment Institute, and Section Chief Huang Zifang of the two railway health sections each reported. Chairman Liu Ruiheng expressed satisfaction with the reports and hoped that efforts would continue this year to prevent an epidemic.</p>
<p>Next, committee members were assigned to each group: Epidemic Prevention Group: Wu Liande (Chairman), Dunske, La Poudre, Yan Fuqing, Luo Bu Sheng, Chen Yonghan, Yang Yongnian, Huang Zifang, Cheng Shuzhen. Publicity Group: Li Tingan (Chairman), Wu Changyao, La Poudre, Huang Zifang, Allen. It was decided that vaccinations would be earnestly implemented starting May 1st. A lengthy discussion followed regarding the vaccines and specific bacteria used, as well as the bacteria count. Cheng Shuzhen, Yang Yongnian, Jordan, and others all expressed opinions. Finally, Huang Zifang proposed, and Wu Liande seconded, the following decisions: (1) When possible, two injections should be given using a standard vaccine containing 2 billion bacteria, the first dose being half a cubic centimeter, and the second dose being one cubic centimeter. (2) If only one injection can be given, use the same vaccine with one cubic centimeter. (3) Inject a smaller number of people with a more concentrated vaccine, such as 4 billion and 8 billion bacteria, to observe its effectiveness and reactions. Regarding chemical testing, it was decided to implement a division of labor to avoid duplication. Fecal samples taken by the concessions would be tested by the Municipal Council's Chemical Laboratory, while fecal samples taken by the Chinese area would be tested by the Shanghai Municipal Health Experiment Institute. The total number of beds in the epidemic hospitals of both the Chinese and concession areas reached over a thousand. If a severe epidemic were to occur, temporary treatment centers would still need to be added. In Wusong, there is a newly built port quarantine hospital that can accommodate over 30 people. Regarding drinking water, it was decided to continue to find ways to provide free tap water so that the general poor population could avoid drinking river and pond sewage. Finally, the disinfection of well water was also fully discussed. The meeting adjourned at 4:30 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Director of the Shanghai Audit Office Talks: Audit Local Agencies First; The Office's Work Is Divided Into Three Categories <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai Audit Office of the Audit Department was officially established in Shanghai on the 1st of this month. Director Lin Jinyu is currently contacting various parties and drafting various regulations to begin auditing work. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited Director Lin, and the discussion is as follows:</p>
<p>Three Types of Work</p>
<p>According to Director Lin, the office's work can be divided into three types: (1) Reviewing and signing payment orders and revenue orders; (2) Auditing calculations and final accounts; (3) Investigating acts of financial impropriety or dereliction of duty. This work is of great importance to finance, and the office will adhere to central laws and regulations and proceed earnestly. Various audit regulations and procedures are currently being drafted and will be started at the various agencies in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>On-Site Auditing</p>
<p>The Audit Department originally required agencies to submit their accounts for auditing. Now, for the sake of solemnity and convenience, it has been changed to on-site auditing. The area under the office's jurisdiction is the Shanghai area, and all agencies established by the central and local governments must be audited on-site by the office.</p>
<p>Audit Steps</p>
<p>Agencies directly under the central government in Shanghai were originally audited by the Audit Department. At the beginning of the office's establishment, the agencies directly under the central government in Shanghai will be temporarily postponed from being transferred to the office's jurisdiction. However, local agencies have always been audited. After the office is established, it will first audit the accounts of local agencies. If it is successful, it will be extended to the agencies directly under the central government in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Coordination Completed</p>
<p>Since taking office, Director Lin has visited Mayor Wu Zhicheng twice. The office has sent personnel to contact Director Cai, and coordination has been completed. The office will send personnel to the municipal government within days for on-site auditing to avoid bureaucratic delays. In short, the audit office's audit work for various agencies will be done in the most straightforward way, so that the agencies will not be burdened with extra delays.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables Ministry of Finance to Request Exemption of Re-export Tax on Shandong Silk <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce cabled the Ministry of Finance yesterday: To the esteemed Finance Ministry in Nanjing, on the 9th of this month, we received a letter from the local silk and satin trade association stating: "We have received a letter from the Shandong and Henan silk group stating that our Shandong silk has always been transshipped through Yantai to Shanghai. During the prosperous period of Shandong silk's foreign trade in the late Qing Dynasty, Westerners from various foreign firms in Yantai organized a sericulture school. Due to lack of funds, they created a 'silk product levy,' collecting 4 taels of customs silver per dan as the school's recurring expenses. This levy was mandatory for all silk exporters, whether Chinese or foreign merchants. Later, as business declined and merchants could not bear the burden, there was widespread resistance. At that time, the Yantai Customs authorities, in order to alleviate the merchants' difficulties, requested the government to exempt customs duties and only collect the silk product levy on all silk exported and transshipped. Since the government issued an order two years ago to exempt all silk exports from tax, the various foreign firms in Yantai collectively decided that since exports were exempt from tax, they were unwilling to continue paying the silk product levy and requested the customs to abolish it. After repeated negotiations, they actually achieved their goal, and the customs abolished the silk product levy and followed the new regulations. All goods exported to foreign countries and Hong Kong are tax-free. As a result, Western merchants can reduce costs by purchasing silk in Yantai due to the tax exemption, while our industry has to transship to Shanghai for sales to foreign firms, thereby increasing the burden of re-export tax. In this era of commercial warfare, with an atmosphere of immeasurable change pervading the globe, merchants who used to seek a profit of 10% are now struggling to secure 0.1%, which is not always guaranteed. Now, with the added burden of customs duties, which outsiders may consider minimal, the costs are different compared to the direct tax-free exports of Western merchants. Not only is it difficult to make a profit, but it will also be a major blow to future foreign trade. It was reported in the newspapers that Finance Minister Kong stated, 'Encouraging exports is the way to reduce trade deficits and ease the burden on the people. Therefore, I propose to the central government to separately reduce or exempt export taxes and abolish re-export taxes. However, reducing or exempting export taxes involves more categories and complex situations, making implementation slower. Abolishing re-export taxes is simple and easy to implement.' The members of our group, in light of the sluggish foreign trade and the re-export tax on goods shipped from Yantai to Shanghai, which prevents them from competing with the direct tax-free exports of Western merchants, have repeatedly suffered failures due to the different costs. The pain they have experienced for years is that goods shipped from Yantai to Shanghai are subject to re-export duties and half tax as well as pier dues. After arriving in Shanghai, due to various difficulties, they cannot be exported under the original permit, and merchants not only sacrifice customs duties but also have to pay pier dues again before they can export. With these kinds of hardships, it is difficult for them to compete with Western merchants and achieve victory. Now that Finance Minister Kong has shown concern for the people and compassion for the merchants, advocating to encourage exports and reduce the burden on the people, and proposing to the central government to separately reduce or exempt export taxes and abolish re-export taxes, it is a great relief to rescue merchants from fire and water. Therefore, we publicly agreed to request your association to forward the facts to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and present them to the Ministries of Finance and Industry for review and to consult the Customs Administration to order the Chief of Customs of the Jianghai Customs and the Customs Commissioner of Yantai to investigate and to order Western merchants to be allowed to immediately abolish the direct tax-free export from Yantai in order to alleviate the merchants' hardships. It is a matter of public convenience.' In light of the above, encouraging exports and reducing the burden on merchants is a matter of urgency. We respectfully request that your esteemed association show compassion for the merchants' hardships and quickly forward the facts separately, requesting a clear order to abolish the re-export tax on goods shipped from Yantai to Shanghai in order to relieve the people's plight and appease the public's expectations. This will be greatly appreciated." It has been heard that silk exports are tax-free, which has been implemented for many years. The government originally intended to promote foreign trade, but because Shandong Province is located inland and Chinese merchants do not have direct export trade, they still have to go through Western merchants in Shanghai. Therefore, this Shandong silk, in Yantai trade, is reported directly for export by Western merchants, while Chinese merchants still transship through Shanghai. Not only do they have to pay an additional re-export tax, but also pier dues in Shanghai. This is because of the tax on re-export and the absence of tax on export, so that the rights enjoyed by Western merchants are superior to those of Chinese merchants. At present, there has been much reporting on the re-export tax, although there is talk of complete abolition, implementation is still pending due to the issue of compensation. However, Shandong silk is a special case, and exports have long been tax-free. If the re-export tax is not abolished immediately, it will be difficult for Yantai Chinese merchants to compete with Western merchants who directly report for export. It is appropriate to cable your ministry, with the facts, requesting your approval to abolish the re-export tax immediately, in order to relieve the merchants' hardships, which is a matter of public convenience.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Industry instructed the Social Affairs Bureau, "According to the report from the Chinese Cement Industry Federation, the purchase of foreign cement by the Yuehan Railway Bureau has caused widespread alarm. We sincerely request that you instruct them to switch to nationally produced goods, and also ask you to instruct your subordinates to adopt nationally produced cement for construction projects in the future in order to set an example and prevent waste." The Ministry has investigated and found that the materials used in state-owned construction projects should, in principle, give priority to the use of nationally produced goods. In addition to approving the Railway Department's reply that it has already instructed the Zhushao section engineering bureau to give priority to the purchase of nationally produced cement in the future, it is appropriate to order the bureau to immediately instruct its subordinates to use nationally produced cement as much as possible in construction projects in order to set an example, which is of utmost importance.</p>

<p>Due to the recent cloudy and rainy weather and rising tides in the Huangpu River, the Shanghai County Government has not completed the river projects dredged in the first, second, and third districts this year, including the Chaiwangjia Ditch, Huangni Bang, Tangchun Jing, Xin Gang, Sunjia Jing, Yaojia Bang Jing, and Dianni Bang. Therefore, County Magistrate Pan telegraphed the district heads yesterday to properly repair the dikes of each river to prevent them from collapsing, and to quickly drain the accumulated water to continue construction. If there are lawless people who try to be lazy in the project and open the dike privately, or if the contractors fail to drain the water, they should be reported separately, arrested, and sent to the county for investigation.</p>

<p>The Taihu Lake Water Conservancy Committee, following the order of the National Economic Committee, dredged the Yu Ji Mound section of the Wusong River and simultaneously closed the dams at two locations near Beizhuang Jing and Yu Ji Mound Ye Jia Zhai on April 1st. After this, other ships, such as rice boats and barges, can still detour through the Nan Gong Pu to enter the Wusong River. However, manure boats are small and light and cannot navigate the Gong Pu, causing a great panic in Shanghai's manure export. It has been reported that the Fuchang Company Cleansing Bureau, affiliated with the Public Concession Public Works Department, has leased a large number of large and small boats since April 1st to transport manure from the entire concession to Pudong and Beixin Jing, where they are buried in pits, so there is no problem. However, the company has suffered huge losses due to the cessation of business and the need to invest in leasing ships for transportation.

The Zhejiang Provincial Government has allocated 350,000 yuan for relief, of which 70,000 yuan has been allocated to the A-Xu Relief Association. The remaining 280,000 yuan has been allocated to various counties based on the severity of the disaster. It has been approved by the standing committee to purchase 20,000 shi of relief rice, which will be distributed according to the original allocation method, and has sent two committee members, Zhang Xueqian and Tu Zhiping, to Shanghai for procurement.

Recently, the association continued to receive letters from the relief committee urging donations. The association immediately remitted the collected donations of more than 2,000 yuan to Wuxi and sent letters to various fellow villagers urging them to continue donating to be remitted to the disaster area for relief.

<p>The Shengshan Islands, affiliated with the fifth district of Chongming County, are fishing areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Every time the fishing season arrives, fishermen and fish merchants from various gangs gather, most of whom are from Zhejiang, such as the former Taizhou and Wenzhou areas, but the most are from Ningbo. It is reported that the Chongming County Business Tax Collection Office has set up a collection branch in the area, levied a temporary business tax on the fishing industry, and ordered the brokers to collect 0.5% of the value of the goods sold by the merchants as business tax. The fishermen and fish merchants in the area were shocked when they heard the news and reported it to the Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association in Shanghai, requesting assistance. The association believes that the government has already issued orders to abolish fish tax and fishing tax. The collection office is cleverly establishing a new name to engage in collection, which is a great loss to the central government's intention to protect the fishing industry. The association will appeal to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, requesting an order to stop it. The document states, "According to reports from Ningbo fishermen and fish merchants, the Chongming County Business Tax Collection Office has posted a notice to levy a temporary business tax on the fishing industry on the islands affiliated with the fifth district of Chongming. A collection branch has been established in the fifth district to prepare for the collection of business tax in the district. The brokers are ordered to collect 0.5% of the value of the goods sold by the merchants as a temporary business tax on the fishing industry. The fishermen and fish merchants were shocked when they heard the news. It has been found that the fishing industry has been declining recently, and the government, in order to maintain the fishing industry, ordered the abolition of the Fisheries Department and prohibited the collection of taxes under new names in the future, and has repeatedly emphasized this. Now, the collection office is collecting a temporary fish business tax similar to the fish tax, which is a contempt for the ban. The fishermen and fish merchants are unable to bear it. Please make an appeal, etc. It has been found that since foreign aggression, China's fishing industry has been in danger. In 1931, the government, in order to protect the fishing industry, issued an order to abolish fish tax and fishing tax and prohibited the collection of disguised fish taxes to relieve the people's difficulties. Now, the collection office is cleverly establishing a new name to engage in collection, which is a great loss to the central government's intention to protect the fishing industry. According to the previous situation, we should send a letter for review, order the cessation of collection to maintain the fishing industry, and relieve the people's difficulties."</p>

<p>On February 20th of this year, at around 10 AM, at the French Water and Electricity Company at 249 Luban Road, the compradore Tu Jinming was taking cash of 20,000 yuan to the bank for storage when he was suddenly attacked by four robbers outside the company's gate. 4,000 yuan was robbed and they fled. The case was investigated by Jin Jiulin, the director of the special agency of the French patrol room, and the patrol officers on duty, who successively arrested Zhang Deji, Pan Yibang, Zhang Yunpeng, Fan Youheng, Xu Xiaogen, Zhu Hanqiang, Pan Yuqing, Yang Yang, Li Zhongxin, Liu Shaogen, Zhao Zhongheng, Xing Yanshou, Zhou Kui, Zhou Lu, Xia Wenfu, Xu Yuecheng, Xu Defu and other 17 men and women suspected of being involved in the robbery and seized handguns and bullets. The arrestees were sent to the Second Special District Local Court requesting detention pending detailed investigation, as reported three times previously. The patrol room has concluded its investigation and sent the defendants to the court for interrogation yesterday morning. At 10 AM, Judge Sun Pengxian and clerk Tao Zongkan went to the criminal court to conduct the interrogation. Attorney Fei Xizhen, representing the police department, stated that it was found that the defendants Zhang De, Fan Youheng, Yang Yang, Liu Shaogen, Zhao Zhongheng, Qiu Yanshou, Zhou Kui, Zhou Lu, and Xu Defu were involved in the robbery. Yang Yang and the fugitive Wang Houqi colluded with the defendants in the case to rob the French Water and Electricity Company of 4,000 yuan, and Yang Yang opened fire. Fortunately, no one was injured. Afterwards, he received 500 yuan for spending and lent the handgun to others for robbery. Although the ninth defendant, Xu Defu, was not involved in the French Water and Electricity Company robbery, he committed another robbery. He is now being prosecuted for robbery with a deadly weapon by a group of three or more people under Article 348 of the Criminal Law. The patrol room found no evidence of crimes committed by Pan Yibang, Zhang Yunpeng, Xu Shaogen, Zhu Hanqiang, Pan Yuqing, Li Zhongxin, Xia Wenfu, and Xu Yuecheng, and they will not be prosecuted. Except for Pan Yibang, who committed a crime in the interior and the Water Police team requested temporary detention, the others should be released. Attorney Ba He, representing the plaintiff, the French Water and Electricity Company, stated that the plaintiff requests a private prosecution to recover the stolen 4,000 yuan. The court checked the report and, considering the complexity of the case and that it was almost noon, ordered that the interrogation be postponed to the 19th. Zhang Yunpeng, Xu Shaogen, Zhu Hanqiang, Pan Yuqing, Li Zhongxin, Xia Wenfu, and Xu Yuecheng were not prosecuted by the patrol room and should be released. The remaining defendants were returned to custody pending further instructions.</p>

<p>The Xinhongxing ship, owned by the Daxing Shipping Company on the Bund, Shanghai, departed from Shanghai for Ningbo at 5 PM on the 8th. When the ship was passing the outer Tongsha Sea area, a young passenger committed suicide by throwing himself into the sea. The facts are as follows:</p>
<p>Sudden Disappearance</p>
<p>The Xinhongxing ship set sail from the Daxing Wharf on the Bund at 5 PM on the 8th and departed for Ningbo. At around 12 AM that night, when the ship was passing the Outer Tongsha, near the Daji Sea, Zhao Delin, the steward of compartment 106 in the steerage, noticed that a young passenger in the adjacent berth had not returned to his berth. It was late at night, and all the windows were closed, so there was no reason for him to be loitering outside the compartment. He searched but found no trace of him.</p>
<p>Letters Discovered</p>
<p>Later, two letters and two photographs were found in his berth. There were no other belongings. At this point, it was known that he had committed suicide by throwing himself into the river. The steward examined the letters, photographs, and other items and reported them to the accounting room. After reading the letters, it was learned that the deceased's name was Zhou Shigui, 19 years old, from Fengshi Town, Yinxi, Ningbo. One of the letters was addressed to his cousin Wang Wenhe, and the address on the letter was Rongtai Cotton Cloth Shop, 10 Jifu Lane, Ningbo Road. The other letter was addressed to his parents.</p>
<p>Not Yet Married</p>
<p>One of the two photographs was of a middle-aged woman, and the other was said to be of his friend. The above letters and photographs were sent by the steward Zhao Delin to Rongchang Cotton Cloth Shop on Ningbo Road, the residence of his cousin Wang Wenhe, after the ship returned to Shanghai from Ningbo yesterday. According to the reporter's inquiry from the second compradore Yu Tinglai of the ship and Rongchang Shop, the cause of death is unknown. It is only known that the deceased was scheduled to marry this winter. His family has been notified by telegram from his cousin Wang Wenhe (the owner of Rongchang Shop).</p>
<p>Two Letters</p>
<p>(1) Respectfully to my dear parents: I am writing to inform you that, due to various sufferings, I have no heart to live. I have achieved my goal today. I hope you will not be sad or commemorate me. Take care of yourselves. I will not say more. Please comfort yourselves. Wishing you happiness. (2) Cousin Wenhe: I hope you are well and everything is fine. I miss you very much. I am writing to you for nothing else. I have unspeakable pain in my heart and have no choice but to end my life in the sea tonight. If there is any emergency in my family, please take care of it. I entrust this to you a thousand times. I will repay you in the next life. Please forgive me. Goodbye, Wenhe.</p>
<p>Not Awakened Until Death</p>
<p>On the newspaper used to wrap the photographs, the following words were written in pencil, which seemed to be left in the last moment before death. It can be said that he was not awakened until death: "So sad, dying in the sea, my body being swallowed by a big fish. It really saves money, no coffin, no money. It is really satisfying to die like this."</p>

<p>According to Datong News Agency, the new channel in the Huangpu River, which is located opposite Gaoqiao Sand, between Zhanghuabang, has been open for some time. Since the channel was opened, it has become a necessary route for ships entering and leaving the Huangpu River. The old channel (slightly to the east) has long been abandoned. Later, the Port Authority, considering that the number of imported ships has been increasing, felt that the channel needed to be widened and dredged further. The Port Authority Director Gu Lien, in consultation with the Huangpu River Dredging Bureau, started dredging on December 1st of last year. Since the project was actively dredged by the No. 2 Hailong Dredging Ship dispatched by the Chief Engineer of the Dredging Bureau and other personnel, it has been more than four months. The entire project has now been completed. In terms of engineering, the east and west ends have been widened by 300 feet each (a total of 600 feet). The length is divided into two locations, one for 3.5 kilometers and one for 1.5 kilometers. The completion of this project will naturally make ships entering and leaving the Huangpu River feel more comfortable. The marker ships set up by the Customs to guide the ships can also be removed by the end of this week.</p>

<p>The Huangpu River Dredging Bureau specially ordered the largest dredging ship from Germany to dredge the Tiaohe Shoal at the mouth of the Yangtze River. It has already set sail for China and passed Singapore yesterday. The supervisor Smith has returned to Shanghai to report on the construction process. The dredging work will begin in early next month. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Dredging Ship has Arrived in Singapore</p>
<p>The Huangpu River Dredging Bureau ordered the largest dredging ship "Jianshe" from the German Xuegao Shipyard two years ago, costing 2.5 million yuan, for the purpose of dredging the Tiaohe Shoal in the Yangtze River. After the ship was completed, it set sail for China at the beginning of last month. Due to the heavy equipment and the bluntness of the hull, the voyage was slow. Yesterday morning, the Huangpu River Dredging Bureau telegraphed Singapore to inquire about the situation of the ship. According to the telegram, it had just passed through and docked the night before and had already set sail for Shanghai. It is estimated that the voyage from Singapore to Shanghai will take at the latest around the 20th of this month.</p>
<p>Supervisor Smith Returned to Shanghai</p>
<p>When the German Xuegao Company contracted to build the dredging ship, the Bureau specially sent engineer Smith, a Westerner, and Zhu Chongxi, to Germany two years ago to supervise the construction. Now that the ship has been completed, supervisor Smith returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday to report everything to the Bureau. Engineer Zhu Chongxi is now accompanying the ship to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Dredging of Tiaohe Shoal to Begin Next Month</p>
<p>The sounding work of the Tiaohe Shoal outside Wusong was completed by the Hydrographic Office of the Naval Department. The location of the shoal is between Tongsha and Guansha in the Yangtze River. There are detailed reports on its area, orientation, and the amount of sediment. According to engineer Ge Tuo of the Huangpu River Dredging Bureau yesterday, after the dredging ship arrives in Shanghai, the inspection and acceptance procedures will be carried out first, and the dredging of the shoal will begin at the beginning of next month, with approximately 20,000 cubic meters of mud being dredged daily. After the dredging, navigation can be guaranteed to be unimpeded.</p>

<p>At around 6 AM the day before yesterday, three robbers broke into the home of Dr. Wang Shiting at No. 16 Yuanchang Lane, Yuanchang Road, Hongkou, each armed with a handgun, and demanded silence. They robbed silver and jewelry, totaling more than 100 yuan. As the robbers were about to escape, Wang followed them and informed the patrol officers, who jointly pursued them, resulting in a gun battle. As a result, one robber was arrested, seriously wounded by gunfire. He was sent to the patrol hospital, but died before medical assistance could be given. A Westerner was killed by a stray bullet, and several passersby were injured. The details have been reported in this newspaper. The Hongkou Patrol Room dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. The body of the robber was taken to the Philan Road morgue. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Local Court sent prosecutor Guo Wei, forensic doctor Wei, clerk Wang Zuyi, and others to the morgue to examine the body. The Western patrol chief Kang Ming reported on the investigation and stated that the stolen gold and silver jewelry and a handgun with five bullets were found on the deceased. He is currently investigating and tracking down the escaped robbers. Wang Shiting, 34 years old, from Dongtai, a doctor, reported that at around 6 AM yesterday morning, three robbers, each armed with a handgun, entered through the back door, all with local accents. They ordered me to take out the safe, but I replied that there was no such safe. Therefore, they robbed approximately 30 to 40 yuan in banknotes and silver, gold and silver jewelry, and left. Afterwards, I followed them and informed the patrol officers, and identified the deceased as one of the three robbers. After hearing the report, prosecutor Guo Wei determined that the deceased was an unnamed man who resisted arrest and was shot and killed by the police on the spot. The bullets in the body should be removed by the forensic doctor and handed over to the patrol room's gun identification department. The handgun and bullets found on the deceased were also handed over to the gun identification department for inspection. The escaped robbers will be arrested and prosecuted by the patrol room. The body was handed over to Pushan Villa for burial. It was also learned that the deceased had seven gunshot wounds, and the bullets did not penetrate. Forensic doctor Wei is currently trying to remove them.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, two travelers came to the Xinyi Hotel at the North Railway Station, claiming to be local people, one named Chen Ziguang, 17 years old, and the other's surname was unknown, only known to be 18 years old. After opening a certain room, after serving tea, the two closed the door and slept together with their clothes on. It was not until 3:15 PM that the waiter discovered that both of them had taken heavy poison to commit suicide. He tried to pry open the door and saw that the two were lying on the bed. The one whose surname was unknown had already died. Chen Ziguang's breathing was weak and his pulse was faint. He urgently called the police to summon an ambulance and sent them to Tongren Hospital. Chen also died shortly after. The deceased had no belongings. A note was found in his pocket, which read, "Taking three kinds of poison, not afraid of not dying."</p>

<p>Shen Wu, a local widow, 23 years old, lived at No. 135 Jingzhou Road. Her husband worked in a yarn factory during his lifetime. The couple had been married for three years and loved each other very much. They had already given birth to two children, and Shen was pregnant again, approaching her seventh month. Unexpectedly, her husband died of illness five days ago, causing her to cry all day long and be extremely resentful. The night before last, she suddenly had the thought of abandoning the world and secretly swallowed opium to commit suicide. When her sister-in-law Shen Xi discovered her, she saw her moaning in bed and immediately called her family to send her to Guangren Hospital for treatment, which was ineffective. She soon died. The hospital reported to the Yulin Road Patrol Room, and detective Pan Yunlong was ordered to investigate. The body was taken to the Philan Road morgue. Yesterday morning, prosecutor Guo Wei was dispatched by the First Special District Local Court to examine the body. After hearing the report from Shen Xi, prosecutor Guo Wei determined that the deceased Shen Wu, female, died of opium poisoning. The body was handed over to Shen Gengquan, a undertaker, who signed a guarantee to take it back for burial.</p>
<h3 id="e147">An Englishman Sues Zhou Bingshen for Land Fraud: A Deed Transferred Under a Proxy Name Changed to the Principal's Name <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Bingshen, a Ningbo native and former manager of the Three Stars Stage, previously served as a comprador for the British-owned "Tide Surge" Water Company. He later ventured into real estate, co-founding the Three Stars Real Estate Company with Huang Chujiu, Zhao Ruquan, and others. Due to business failures, Zhou sold the Three Stars Stage, leading to numerous lawsuits. Zhou has now moved his family to Shaoxing.</p>
<p>An Englishman named Lai Wuzhe, an accountant for the British-owned water company, entrusted Zhou on December 29, 1931, to purchase land and buildings at 397 and 398 Qipu Road, for a price of 5,777 taels of silver. Lai paid with a check and, upon receiving the deed, asked Zhou to obtain the land ownership certificate from the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau. Zhou repeatedly delayed the process, citing the need for "fees." Recently, Lai discovered that Zhou had indeed obtained the land ownership certificate from the Land Bureau, but the certificate was issued in Zhou Bingshen's name. Furthermore, on August 19, 1933, Zhou mortgaged the land certificate to the Jiangnan Bank for 12,000 yuan. Lai believes Zhou Bingshen's actions constitute fraud and reported the matter to the Public Concession Police Headquarters.</p>
<p>Following investigations by Chinese Detective Feng Zhiming and a Western detective, an arrest warrant was requested from the First Special District Court and served at 12 Anyi Lane, Wuding Road. However, Zhou had already relocated to Shaoxing. The warrant was then delivered to Zhou's civil case lawyer. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng of the First Special Court held a criminal hearing. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu presented the case, charging Zhou with fraud under Article 363 of the Criminal Code and submitting the check as evidence. Zhou's civil litigation lawyer appeared in court, stating that Zhou had moved to Shaoxing and that the exact address would need to be verified and reported later, requesting the court to formally request assistance from the Shaoxing court for the summons. Lawyer Zhang immediately requested that if Zhou's address could not be verified, a warrant for his arrest should be issued. The presiding judge reviewed the request and ordered the case adjourned for two weeks.</p>

<p>Zhao Zhengshi, a Wuxi woman residing at 8, Lane 163, Bazilu Road, reported that her Sichuanese maid, Lu Chengjin, had stolen valuables worth 230 yuan, including cash, clothes, and jewelry, and abducted Zhao’s eleven-year-old relative, Ah Jin, while Zhao was out. She reported the incident to the Hongkou Police. Detectives Zhang Yunsheng and Chen Dabao were assigned to the case but were unable to locate her.</p>
<p>It was later discovered that Lu Chengjin had a lover named Lu A Jin, a 34-year-old tailor, who was acquainted with You Genfu, a fellow villager living at 28 Tiwenta Lu Road in the French Concession. Investigators questioned You, who stated that Lu A Jin had returned to their hometown on the 25th of the month with a woman. Lu lives at 3 Shijiaqiao Bridge, outside Xudou in Suzhou, where his brother, Lu Yuexiang, runs a teahouse. The detectives reported to their superiors and obtained an official letter from the First Special District Court. The day before yesterday, they traveled to Suzhou by train and, together with Public Security Bureau detectives, secretly went to the address, arrested Lu Chengjin and her lover Lu A Jin, rescued the girl Zheng Ah Jin, and brought them back to Shanghai to be detained separately. Zheng was returned to Zhao Zhengshi.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, they were brought before the Third Criminal Court. Municipal Council lawyer Li Zhishan described the case, stating that Zhao Zhengshi claimed the stolen items included 100 yuan in cash from under her pillow, 50 yuan in cash from a box, several silk garments, and five gold buttons. Only ten yuan in cash and three gold buttons were found on Lu Chengjin. She denied the remaining charges. Following further investigation, the Chinese and Western detectives reported on the process of arresting the two defendants in Suzhou. The ten yuan in cash was presented as evidence. Zhao Zhengshi stated that she had gone to a relative's house and returned home at around 10 p.m., finding only her eight-year-old son asleep on the floor. Her niece, Ah Jin, and Lu Chengjin were missing, and the above-mentioned items had been stolen. Ah Jin stated that she was asleep when Lu Chengjin woke her up and took her to a hotel, where Lu Chengjin also stayed for one night before going to Suzhou. When questioned, the two defendants gave evasive answers. Lu Chengjin claimed that Zheng Ah Jin was crying and insisted on going with her, so she took her home, but had no intention of selling her, and asked for leniency. Judge Wu Zehan ordered them to be detained separately pending sentencing.</p>

<p>The civilian housing project planned by the city is about to begin. The authorities have submitted a request to the central government for review. As a result, the municipal government instructed the Public Security Bureau and Social Affairs Bureau to first survey and register the shantytowns in Zhabei and West Shanghai for reference. It is reported that Wu Xingya of the Social Affairs Bureau and Cai Jingjun, the director of the Public Security Bureau, issued a joint announcement yesterday stating: "The Social Affairs Bureau and the Public Security Bureau received Instruction No. 12859 from the Municipal Government, stating that the Finance Bureau submitted a proposal for the West Shanghai Electric Power Company to borrow money to carry out civilian welfare projects, which is currently under review by the central government. Once this case is approved, civilian housing will be built. However, a survey and registration of the shantytowns along Qimei Road and in Zhabei and West Shanghai will be conducted beforehand for reference. Once the civilian housing is completed, residents listed in the registry will be ordered to move in as appropriate. Therefore, we are instructed to handle this matter jointly. After investigation, the survey and registration of shantytowns are related to the welfare of the residents and should be carried out as soon as possible. In addition to the Public Security Bureau issuing the original registration form to each branch bureau for compliance, it must be submitted to the bureau for verification before May 10th of this year.

<h3 id="e150">Foreign Cigarette Merchants Increase Sales by Over 30,000 Cases per Month, Chinese Merchants Hit Hard <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from the Shang Guo Wen She (Business News Agency) met with Mr. Shen Weiting, chairman of the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Merchants Association, who stated that in recent months, the sales of foreign cigarettes have increased significantly, by approximately 36,000 cases per month compared to the past. The reasons are twofold: (1) Foreign cigarette merchants are dumping cigarettes at low prices. For example, the "Little Fairy" brand used to sell for over 160 yuan per case, but now it has dropped to 142 yuan per case, and each empty pack can be exchanged for one cigarette. Each case contains 5,000 packs, which can be exchanged for 5,000 cigarettes, worth approximately 14 yuan. The actual selling price per case is 128 yuan. The cost of raw materials and labor is approximately 30 yuan, and taxes are 80 yuan. After adding discounts and commissions, there is little profit left. Chinese merchants cannot afford to compete. However, foreign merchants have strong capital and are not currently focused on making money, but on defeating Chinese merchants in order to monopolize the market permanently. (2) In the past, Chinese cigarette factories could still use gifts to promote their products, which attracted more customers, even with limited resources and methods. However, since the ban on gifts, Chinese merchants have lost their promotional tools. Coupled with the pressure of foreign merchants dumping, the future is very dangerous.</p>

The divers repaired and filled the holes in the ship, pumped out the accumulated water, and floated it to the surface. It has been safely salvaged and towed away. The Hydrographic Office of the Naval Department has notified all shipping companies, stating that the sunken ship in the Yangtze River channel has been salvaged, the markings on the charts have been removed, and ships can travel without danger.</p>

<p>The "Zi Lin" newspaper reports that the French Concession Municipal Council has been discussing the Shanghai Telephone Company's fee increase proposal in recent days, and progress has been made. It is expected that discussions will be held with the Public Concession Municipal Council within days. It is reported that the French Municipal Council is willing to follow the Telephone Company's suggestion of charging based on the number of calls used. As for the fee increase, it believes that an increase of 10% is sufficient. However, the Public Concession Municipal Council has proposed allowing a maximum increase of 12.5%. Therefore, the French Municipal Council may suggest a compromise increase of 11%. However, regardless of the agreement reached, it will only be a trial for one year. If the two parties cannot reach an agreement, it is planned to reconsider the matter.</p>

<p>Large numbers of beggars roam the streets of this city, begging and harassing passersby, which not only affects social stability but also the appearance of the city. Therefore, Cai Jingjun, director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, sent a letter to the Shanghai Federation of Charitable Organizations yesterday (the 11th), requesting them to find ways to provide shelter: "According to reports from the Supervision Department of the Bureau, the number of beggars in the city is increasing daily. They roam the streets in groups of three or five, seeking food, or wander around traffic intersections and train stations, following people and asking for money. Merchants and residents are harassed by them, and pedestrians avoid them. Some beggars are aggressive and extremely annoying. Due to the limited capacity of detention facilities, it is difficult to effectively manage them. Therefore, they are driven away to the east and run to the west, following the drivers, which not only affects social stability but also the appearance of the city. Please forward this request to charitable organizations to consider establishing shelters, or expanding work-study programs for vagrants to deal with this situation. After reviewing the above-mentioned points, it is indeed the case. We are sending a letter to your association, hoping that you will investigate, promptly review, and provide a response."</p>

<h3 id="e163">Establishment of the Shanghai Alumni Association of the National Police Academy <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The National Police Academy, founded by the former Ministry of Internal Affairs in 1917, has graduated more than ten classes. All graduates were submitted to the ministry and assigned to various provinces for employment. After completing a one-year internship in the province, they were employed as recommended police officers. Therefore, the police organs in various provinces are led by graduates of the Police Academy. After the national capital was established in Nanjing, the Ministry of Internal Affairs moved the Beijing Police Academy to Nanjing. At the same time, Police Academy alumni serving in the police force of the capital established the Police Academy Alumni Association. The Shanghai Public Security Bureau also employs dozens of Police Academy graduates. Therefore, on the 23rd of last month, the founding meeting of the Shanghai Alumni Association of the National Police Academy was held at the People's Education Center in the Wenmiao Temple in Nanshi. Five directors, three supervisors, and various staff members were elected in accordance with the regulations to actively carry out association affairs. Representatives from the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau were sent to provide guidance, and the order was very good. The association then issued a declaration informing Police Academy alumni across the country to unite and initiate actions in their respective regions to achieve the goal of revitalizing the national police administration and creating a new country. The text of the declaration is as follows: "The people of the country have suffered from disturbances for a long time. The lack of stability in the localities and the lack of order lead to the inability to live in peace and the inability to work happily. As a result, scholars are noisy in schools, farmers are lazy in the fields, and industry and commerce are exhausted in the markets. Those who observe the country say that this is a disease of the country's police administration. However, our country has been nurturing police talents for many years. Because the nurturing of ordinary police talents is insufficient, we are nurturing higher-level police talents to enable them to use what they have learned to perform their duties, so that the police administration will become increasingly enlightened. Those who know say that this is not because the higher-level police talents are incapable, but because the higher-level police talents have not fully demonstrated their abilities. The country has established the Police Academy for eighteen years. It is governed by a special ministry and defined by special subjects. From 1917 to the present, they have continued to graduate, assign, and employ, from the central government to various provinces, without counting the thousands of people, accounting for a small half of the statistics of police officials across the country. However, the police chiefs of various provinces, who are filled by higher-level police talents, are still not numerous. In modern times, military affairs are related to the police, and it is said that the police and law and politics are connected. In various countries in the East and West, police officers are specialized officials and cannot be compared with each other. Although, there is no need to worry, now the Ministry of Internal Affairs is moving the Police Academy to the capital, and personally and carefully training them. This shows that they value the role of higher-level police talents. Then we are fortunate to be in Shanghai, the center of politics, culture, and economy, where we can easily adapt and make achievements. If we do not take this opportunity to combine our wisdom and gather our strength, to contribute to the improvement of the police administration and to study the advancement of police science, would we not be betraying the grand heart of valuing higher-level police talents? The members of the Shanghai Alumni Association of the National Police Academy have been established. We hereby reveal this righteousness and tell the students in various provinces and cities that promoting a new life, creating a new life, and creating a new country must begin with revitalizing the national police administration. My fellow students, let us come together."</p>

<p>At around 10:30 last night, a Japanese detective from the Hongkou Police Station was patrolling in the North Sichuan Road area and checking pedestrians when he passed the intersection of Laobazi Road. He saw two men behaving suspiciously, walking hurriedly as if plotting something. The detective quickly stepped forward and ordered them to stop and submit to inspection. Unexpectedly, the two men were bandits. When they realized that their actions had been exposed, they became anxious and took preemptive action, pulling out a gun and firing at the Japanese detective's foot before fleeing into a nearby dark alley. The detective was shot in the back of the foot and fell to the ground. Fortunately, nearby patrolling officers heard the alarm and arrived. They took him to Fumin Hospital for treatment and reported back to the police station to pursue the fleeing bandits.</p>

<p>The Shanghai branch of the Guangzhou Wu Hua Industrial Trust Bank at 130 Ningbo Road, Public Concession, and the Eight Immortals Bridge branch at the intersection of Mai Bao Lu Road and Xiafei Road in the French Concession, simultaneously went bankrupt on August 21 of last year due to financial difficulties. The savings account holders and creditors of the two branches, including Chu Longgen, Chen Xianji, Luo Lihua, Shi Pengfei, Du Zhiji, Shi Bilong, Shen Peng, Zhou Delin, Wang Fulin, and Pan Yuanji, entrusted lawyers to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, accusing the vice-managers of the two branches, Fan Shaoliang, Ye Haitian, Wang Jian'e (who has now joined the Shanghai Bar Association and is practicing law in Shanghai), Wu Yousan, the assistant managers Xie Shunzhi and Tang Songshan, and the councilors Tang Shoumin and Chen Bingqian of fraud, breach of trust, and violation of banking regulations, requesting that they be investigated and punished according to the law. The court accepted the case and Judge Zhang Chaozuo held several hearings and interrogated the clearing representative Gong Linsheng and the accountant Li Cheng, who were sent by the head office to investigate the accounts. The arguments had been concluded and a date for sentencing had been set. However, in order to protect the interests of the creditors, and because the organizational structure of the branch had not been fully understood, the court announced that the conclusion of the arguments was revoked, and the arguments were reopened to summon and examine all parties. As reported previously, some of the plaintiffs filed civil lawsuits against the defendants in the First Special Court. Yesterday, Judge Zhang of the Second Special Court held a special criminal hearing in the Second Court (the sixth hearing). Only four of the plaintiffs, Luo Lihua, Shi Pengfei, Wang Fulin, and Pan Yuanji, attended the hearing with their lawyers. The defendants also attended the hearing with their defense lawyers Jiang Yiping, Hua Maosheng, and Wu Kaisheng. After the hearing began, the judge summoned the plaintiffs and defendants to the court. First, the judge ordered the plaintiff's lawyer to state the intent of the prosecution, and then briefly questioned each defendant about their responsibilities and duties. Then, the judge ordered the lawyers of both sides to argue, and then announced the conclusion of the case, scheduling the sentencing for the 15th.</p>

<p>Chen Jinlan, a Ningbo native nicknamed "Snake Skin Jinlan," was arrested by the French police and sent to the Second Special Court for shooting and killing Chen Zhikui, the owner of the Qianfengtai Candle Shop at 52 Dongxinqiao Street, French Concession, on the afternoon of April 14, 1933. She was sentenced to 14 years in prison and imprisoned in cell No. 11 of the Heavy Criminal Department of the Detention Center. The convict repeatedly appealed the sentence. After the Supreme Court's third trial, the sentence was changed to 12 years of imprisonment. Just as the sentence was about to be carried out, she escaped from prison on the morning of December 27 of last year, taking advantage of the guards' negligence. The former warden of the Detention Center, Gao Xiaopian, transferred the six guards on duty for the three shifts, Yang Xingcun, Wang Guanghe, Fang Yuqi, Yan Ling, Zhou Wenjin, and Shi Shenghe, to the Prosecutor's Office of the Second Special Court for investigation and prosecution. After repeated hearings and strict investigations by the chief prosecutor, it was determined that the guards Fang Yuqi and Zhou Wenjin were negligent in their duties and were responsible for facilitating the escape. They were prosecuted in the Criminal Court of the same level court. Judge Tong Chaozuo heard the case and the defendants hired lawyers to defend themselves. As previously reported, the trial has been concluded. Yesterday, Judge Zhang and Prosecutor Wang held a special criminal hearing in the Second Court and ordered Fang and Zhou to be brought to the court. Fang Yuqi was sentenced to two years and six months imprisonment, and Zhou Wenjin was sentenced to two years imprisonment. During the appeal period, the defendants will remain in the Detention Center.</p>

<p>Over forty merchants and tenants in Bao Xing Fang, North Henan Road in this city, believe that in the current economic downturn, rents are still increasing rather than decreasing, making it truly difficult to sustain their businesses.

<h3 id="e175">China New Village Construction Company Proposes: Reforming the Real Estate Investment System; Advocating a New Model of Cooperative Investment in New Village Real Estate, Opening Up a New Avenue for Real Estate Investors <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Due to the decline of the rural economy within the city and the impact of the global recession from abroad, credit contraction has led to currency tightening, causing real estate to stagnate. Taking real estate as an example, financial institutions mostly refuse mortgages, and vacant houses are everywhere. Those who have already invested are troubled by interest payments, and those who wish to invest are wary of repeating past mistakes. As a result, the real estate market in this city has fallen into stagnation. This phenomenon is partly due to the impact of the economic recession, but the poor investment system is the main cause. Unreasonable management and a lack of meticulous planning, even with abundant funds, are like throwing money into a bottomless pit. In view of this, the China New Village Construction Company, based on the principle of savings and adopting a cooperative method, has created a new model of cooperative investment in new village real estate. This method involves investors depositing their funds into the bank designated by the company. The company then builds the houses designated by the residents in the new village. After completion and handover, the investors collect rent and interest. This method, due to the balance of supply and demand, eliminates the risk of vacant rentals and provides reliable profits. The company's operating policy is based on building new villages and connecting to the spirit of rural prosperity, progressing gradually according to its own capabilities, solving housing problems for urban residents on the one hand and opening up a bright path for investors on the other. The specific measures for cooperative investment in new village real estate have been planned and will be announced soon. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Hiring of Consultants</p>
<p>The cooperative investment method for new village real estate created by the company extracts the strengths of general real estate investment and corrects its shortcomings, creating a new and rational real estate investment system. The company, in establishing this method, is still in its early stages, and it is closely related to the future of the business. Therefore, it attaches great importance to it. In addition to inviting many experts to carefully study and formulate the method, it has also hired Zhang Naiqi, Li Quanshi, Pan Xulun, and Zhu Gengxin as consultants. These four are economists who serve in the financial sector. At the same time, an agency department has been added to handle real estate investment matters. It is said that Mr. Sun Dingcheng has been hired as the director of the department. Mr. Sun graduated from Jinling University and has served as a foreign secretary at the Jianghan Customs, a director of the Dalian Customs Special Photography Station, and a director of accounting at the Tianjin Customs. He has extensive knowledge and experience.</p>
<p>Eight Major Advantages</p>
<p>The cooperative real estate investment method created by the company examines the shortcomings of current businesses and corrects them, so it has the following advantages: (1) No limitation on capital. Based on the principle of cooperation, only funds of 500 yuan or more are required to invest in this real estate business. (2) Remedy for the ills of vacant rentals. According to the principle of balancing supply and demand, houses are built only after there are residents, ensuring that there are absolutely no vacant rentals. (3) Increase the interest rate on real estate investment. After the investment funds are handed over to the bank for collection, interest will accrue from the second day onwards, without any loss of interest during the intermediate period. (4) Reduce all due expenses. Investing in this real estate can reduce all due expenses, such as management fees, repair fees, and land taxes and housing depreciation. (5) Solid and Surpassing Guarantee. All the real estate invested by the investor provides an individual guarantee, and the original value is reduced by 10%. Only 90% of the cost is required to enjoy 100% of the rights. (6) Avoid Difficulties in Transfer. This real estate investment method has a fixed term and guarantees no vacant rentals, making it extremely easy to transfer. (7) Eliminate Troublesome Procedures. Investing in this real estate eliminates extremely troublesome matters, such as selecting locations, managing neighborhoods, planning rentals, and dealing with tenants. (8) No need to possess real estate investment knowledge. The company employs professionals to handle all matters, and they are well aware of the advantages and disadvantages of real estate. Investors can rest assured.</p>
<p>Collecting Bank</p>
<p>The China Economic Credit Cooperative Fund Management Committee, which manages the company's investment funds, has entrusted the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to collect funds in order to facilitate investors. Anyone wishing to make a cooperative real estate investment with the company can go to the company to fill out an investment trust form, sign the trust, and leave a seal impression at the company. At the same time, they can collect a payment notice and pay the total amount of the entrusted investment to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. They can then exchange the receipt for a New Village Real Estate Cooperative Investment Certificate of the same amount from the company. The total amount of the company's first phase of cooperative real estate investment is temporarily set at 500,000 yuan, and solicitation will continue until the full amount is reached.</p>
<p>Zhang Yongnian Talks</p>
<p>According to Mr. Zhang Yongnian, general manager of the company, if we want to seek the development of Shanghai, we must first engage in the revitalization of the rural economy. To make a tree grow tall, we must strengthen its roots. The purpose of establishing the New Village business is based on this idea. With the support of various sectors, the Rose Garden New Village is progressing smoothly and is now actively under construction. Completion is expected soon. The advocacy of cooperative investment in new village real estate opens up a bright path for real estate investors and expands the scope of the Rose Garden New Village. It is hoped that all sectors will actively invest to promote a prosperous rural society.</p>

<h3 id="e179">Jin Cheng Bank 1934 Business Report (28) <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>(8) Conclusion: Banks have a mission in the national economy. Therefore, their business policies should be based on observing and assessing economic trends and properly assisting their development in order to fulfill their responsibilities. The domestic and international economic situation and various developments in the bank's business in 1934 have been briefly outlined above. However, we must examine the past and assess the future to determine the future direction of the Chinese and foreign economies and to serve as a basis for the bank's policies. The economic relationship between the major countries of the world and our country is most significant in terms of trade and foreign exchange, especially the United States, Britain, and Japan, which are at the forefront of our trade. The trade balance of these three countries has shown good results due to currency inflation and exchange dumping. In the near future, their policies are unlikely to change drastically. Although European countries such as France and Italy still maintain the gold standard, their trade relations should also restrict imports and encourage exports by appropriate means. The second Five-Year Plan is also nearing completion, and the dumping of low-grade industrial products and agricultural products may become even more severe. Moreover, countries, based on their group economic policies, collect low-priced raw materials, promote their products, and strive to expand their groups in order to extend their influence. Our country is in a special position and has long been watched by the great powers. In particular, if the United States' national silver policy does not change, the economic circles of our country may continue to be affected. However, adversity can strengthen the country. If the government and all sectors of society can fulfill their responsibilities and work together, it will not be difficult to cope. According to the government authorities, the "procedures should be determined and implemented successively according to the current situation of the national economy and its possible development." Regarding the rumored currency inflation policy, it is also said that "it is absolutely not suitable for China and will harm the interests of the entire people. The government has no intention of adopting it." Therefore, the principles of economic construction and monetary policy of our government in the future have been announced. However, how to promote domestic basic industries, daily necessities industries, and important agricultural and mineral products to revitalize industries and achieve self-sufficiency, how to limit the large-scale import of agricultural products, food, and certain industrial products, and encourage their export to prevent leakage and seek a balance of trade, as well as improve international payment relations, and how to adjust foreign exchange and improve currency, it is expected that the government will be able to coordinate the overall situation and set specific plans as early as possible and implement them effectively. Among them, restricting the import of agricultural products and promoting domestic production are closely related to the revival of rural areas. Since the government presides over and promotes it, the society should support its implementation. However, even in terms of the rural economy, its scope is broad, and its organization is not yet complete. The contribution of our financial industry is not easy. It seems appropriate to concentrate our efforts and work together to achieve the effect of mutual support. As for this bank, which is a commercial bank, it is limited in its ability, but it will do its best to provide services. In addition to working together with all sectors of society and the industry, it will continue to work hard to achieve what it can do. The following are the respective measures: (1) In terms of credit, this bank is fortunate to be recognized by society and entrusted with funds. In the future, it should strive for the proper and convenient accumulation of funds, the prudent use of funds, and the joint reduction of deposit interest rates with the industry to reduce the capital cost of social undertakings and promote their development. (2) In terms of lending, this bank, in its position as a commercial bank, should provide assistance to various businesses in accordance with the principles of commercial finance. All investments should avoid non-production. Therefore, it has always provided assistance to production undertakings, and it is particularly willing to assist in the circulation of its products. It should continue to work with all sectors of society and the industry to assist in rural economy, mining and chemical industries, daily necessities industries, and railway transportation. As for important agricultural products such as food and cotton, and large-scale mineral products such as coal, jointly or independently, conduct various research and improvements in production and marketing, provide the use of appropriate institutions, and facilitate financing. It should also continue to cooperate with local authorities to support the sound development of small-scale agricultural, industrial, and commercial businesses. Warehouses are of great benefit to the circulation of goods and the turnover of industrial capital. In addition to having goods machines in major commercial ports and some rural areas, this bank should also consider setting up warehouses along railway lines to facilitate the distribution of products. (3) In terms of personnel, this bank is increasing its services to all sectors of society, so it feels it is necessary to cultivate appropriate talents. In the future, the policy of employing people should still be based on examination and training, so that they can be used according to their abilities. In short, this bank's business should continue to carefully examine the economic environment from time to time, and it should still be based on the consistent principle of prudent development, and it should work harder to make a small contribution to the national economy, so as to live up to the kindness of our shareholders and those in society who care for this bank. We hope that our shareholders and people from all walks of life will not hesitate to encourage and guide us, so that we can make more contributions. We look forward to it.</p>

In terms of organization, it is divided into two departments: guidance and administration, with a total of four staff members. Due to the inconvenient transportation and closed-mindedness of the people in Anhui Province, there are two sports fields in the provincial capital, one inside the province and one outside the city.

In Article 9 of the draft regulations, the word "field residence" should be changed to "position". G. Contingency expenses should also be included. H. The minimum expenditure limit for provincial sports fields should also be stipulated. It was also decided that the regulations should be reported in writing by the directors of each field, and submitted to the Ministry of Education by the end of May. The report content should be divided into: A. Objectives, B. Organization, C. Expenses, D. Field and equipment, E. Work policy, F. Future plans, G. Special work and progress.</p>
<p>Exhibition of Supplies: (2) Committee member Hao Gengsheng proposed that physical education be included in the high school entrance examination curriculum. It was resolved to request the Ministry of Education to promptly issue measures for the physical education subject in the high school graduation examination.

Tomorrow (the 11th), starting at 3:15 PM, the Association has specially invited Mr. Cai Yuanpei, a renowned figure in academic circles, to give a speech at the China and West Radio Station on how to study philosophy. The full text of Mr. Wang Yunwu's speech on methods of reading is recorded below:</p>
<p>Methods of Reading: Today, I am honored to be invited by the Cultural Construction Association to speak on methods of reading. Regarding this issue, scholars hold quite different views. Some believe that if one has an interest in reading, there is nothing one cannot read, and no method is needed. Others say that reading without a method is like sailing without a compass, drifting aimlessly in the vast sea, unable to reach the destination. I believe both views have merit, and that interest and method are complementary, not contradictory. Having an interest naturally leads to finding appropriate methods, and having methods makes it easier to generate interest. However, whether to start with method or with interest is worth considering. I believe that if one starts with interest, the first question is how to,</p>
<p>Stir Up Interest: The second question is how long it takes to find appropriate methods after stirring up interest. As for starting with method, it is much simpler. As long as someone provides guidance on appropriate methods, one can follow them and soon develop an interest. Once interest arises, it may even lead to finding better methods. Now, let me give a personal example. In my youth, I was stimulated by my environment and unwilling to submit to it, so I felt an interest in reading. But at that time, I had absolutely no idea about reading methods. I fumbled and stumbled, and although I read a lot of books, I took many detours. To be more specific, many friends know that thirty years ago, I did something extremely foolish, which was to read the entire Encyclopedia Britannica from cover to cover. The Encyclopedia Britannica contains many disciplines, with vastly different natures. What good does it do for a person to read it all? Not only may one not fully understand it, but even if one understands and remembers everything, it only broadens one's general knowledge a little. If one could use the same time and energy, following a</p>
<p>Suitable Procedure: To focus on reading books in one category, the achievement would increase many times over. Moreover, because I started with such a foolish thing, in the following twenty years or so, although I read many books, it was merely expanding on the Encyclopedia Britannica. So, after reading for twenty or thirty years, I had virtually no expertise. It was only in recent years that I realized my mistake and focused on studying one or two subjects. If I had discovered this ten years earlier, I might have achieved more. In short, I developed an interest in reading thirty years ago, but I only found a method of reading in recent years. Because I have suffered from this, I strongly advise everyone to pay attention to methods when starting to read. Now, let me discuss</p>
<p>My Propositions: On methods of reading, I believe that doing scholarship is like building a house: one must first lay the foundation and then start building. The foundation of scholarship is undoubtedly literacy and knowledge of various general subjects. Assuming a level equivalent to the current junior high school graduation as the standard, one can start building on this foundation, in other words, one can start a systematic study. To be more specific, one can choose a subject of interest and read extensively on it. But how can one stir up the interest in reading and develop the habit of continuous reading in the future? I believe the best way is to choose a central question from the beginning and write a systematic manuscript or a systematic paper. This manuscript or paper is not for printing and publication but as a personal account of reading. In the past, scholars advocated making notes, which is indeed a good method, but the nature of notes is disorganized, and their structure is scattered. Although they can help with memory and writing practice, they cannot cultivate</p>
<p>Research Habits: And interests. Conversely, if one can choose a central topic and write a systematic paper, reading will have a purpose, and one will naturally turn to related books and magazines to search for materials. If one finds sufficient material, it is like finding gold in the sand, and the joy is unimaginable. If one does not find sufficient material, it is like craving food when hungry or craving drink when thirsty, and the desire is intense. Originally, the purpose of the graduation thesis written by senior students in universities is like this, but unfortunately, major universities in the country do not pay much attention to this and go through the motions, so the effect is not significant. I have often thought that not only university students should put ten times more effort into writing a deeply researched graduation thesis each, but also high school students should each write a graduation thesis of at least 50,000 words, and even junior high school students should write a thesis of 20,000 to 30,000 words. Because doing such a thesis requires reading more books, practicing writing, and organizing thoughts. Those who study a specialized field can certainly explore specialized issues, while ordinary students can also gather information on simple issues and engage in</p>
<p>Systematic Narration: Now I can advise those who are not studying in schools, if they are interested in continuing to read, it is best to choose a central topic at random. These central topics, big ones are world events and national politics, secondary ones are philosophical problems and scientific principles, small ones are like Peking duck, and nearby ones are like the City God Temple in Shanghai, can all be used as research topics. In particular, the smaller the topic, the more likely it is to arouse interest in reading. However, when starting research, it is best to ask a researcher to give him a rough guide to the research procedure and the materials that should be collected. After a considerable amount of research, he will naturally and automatically search for materials. Now the Cultural Construction Association has invited many experts to select the books that young people who aspire to read should read, just as they have laid the foundation of knowledge for everyone. How to start building on this foundation depends on your own choices and plans. I advise you all to pre-select a topic each, based on this topic, first seek information from the designated books, and you will all develop an interest in the books you read. At the same time, if you have extra energy, you will naturally seek more information on the questions in other books. In this way, your architectural structure in the field of study you are pursuing can be completed sooner rather than later due to intense interest. The end.</p>

<p>Qiu Zhizhong, a professor at National Jinan University, has a long-standing research interest in urban sociology. He has published books such as "Practical Urban Sociology," "Principles of Urban Sociology," and "Evolutionary History of Urban Society." His book "Urban Social Problems" is still in progress. Currently, the University Faculty and Staff Association of this city is promoting scholarship and sparing no effort, recognizing that various academic disciplines in neighboring Japan are highly developed, especially in the area of social policy, which has special achievements. Qiu Zhizhong, a member of the association, has a deep research in emerging academic disciplines, so he was sent to Tokyo to investigate the structure of urban society and urban social policies, hoping that he can make some contributions to the domestic academic community when he returns to China in the future. It is said that Mr. Qiu has already asked someone to teach his courses at Jinan University and will go to Japan in a few days.</p>

<h3 id="e198">Chen Heqin Discusses Again: The Pros and Cons of Phonetic Symbols and Chinese Characters <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Chen Heqin has published talks in various newspapers on the issue of phonetic symbols and Chinese characters. After the North China News Agency issued Mr. Ge Lijinxi's interpretation of Chen's four opinions on the 1st of this month, Chen made the following remarks:</p>
<p>(1) Mr. Ge believes that phonetic symbols are symbols for recognizing characters, just like punctuation marks. This analogy does not seem very appropriate. In terms of form, punctuation marks are nothing more than a dot or a line, unlike the numerous and varied changes of phonetic symbols. In terms of quantity, they are only used once per sentence or per clause, and are not attached to the side of each character. Generally, punctuation marks are placed below the characters and are not attached to the side of the characters. Therefore, punctuation marks are clearly different from characters, while phonetic symbols are bound to be confused with characters. When reading, looking at two kinds of symbols at the same time, characters and phonetic symbols, takes more time, which is undeniable.</p>
<p>(2) According to my investigation of Japanese newspapers, only one or two out of ten characters are annotated with Kana, which is not comparable to Mr. Ge's proposal to annotate each Chinese character with ancient symbols. It is also said that Japanese newspapers annotate Kana even in six-point type, but the so-called six-point type is definitely not for children to read. If children's books and textbooks are also the same, I am afraid that Mr. Ge cannot guarantee that they will not all become nearsighted.</p>
<p>(3) Attention can only be focused on one point, which is generally recognized by psychologists. If phonetic symbols and Chinese characters are listed side by side, if you only look at Chinese characters when reading, phonetic symbols are useless. If you look at both at the same time and pay attention at the same time, time-consuming, disturbing, and various errors will occur, which will have a great impact on the teaching process.</p>
<p>(4) Mr. Ge also believes that research is needed before implementation. However, there is no shortage of universities with complete equipment and experts with rich experience in the country. Appropriate plans can be used for practical research. If we do not conduct factual experiments first and rashly use tens of millions of children across the country as experimental products, the price may be too high.</p>
<p>(5) During my trip to Singapore this time, I personally saw that the teachers and students of overseas Chinese schools can all speak fluent Mandarin, which is very different from the past when Cantonese and Fujianese translators were needed. Mr. Pan Gongzhan, the director of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, also had the same feeling during his trip to Nanyang to investigate education in the Philippines. However, overseas Chinese in Nanyang did not read textbooks with phonetic symbols and characters side by side before. In fact, all the credit goes to the teachers in schools who teach Mandarin. It can be seen that unifying Mandarin and unifying pronunciation all depend on the efforts of competent teachers, and not on the superfluous phonetic symbols and Chinese characters.</p>

<p>Quanzhou Private Quanzhou Middle School in Fujian is funded and operated by overseas Chinese from Southeast Asia, and it is quite large in scale. Last month, the 26th tour group of the school set off to visit and tour the Shanghai-Hangzhou area. The group of more than 20 people, led by teachers Zhang Zhijin and others, first went to Hangzhou. The day before yesterday afternoon, they arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou. At around 5:00 PM, they came to visit this museum. We immediately sent someone to receive them. In addition to guiding them to visit all departments of the museum, the receptionist explained in detail the museum's organization and business operations.

<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Boling said: "The first point in saving the country is to purchase and use domestic goods." The relationship between domestic goods and the national lifeline is generally recognized. Mr. Zhang came from North China and, seeing the prevalence of Japanese goods in North China, suffered endless spiritual pain. Therefore, he advised people to purchase and use domestic goods as the first point in saving the country. If one cannot use domestic goods, are they qualified to talk about saving the country, to do work to save the country? But North China is like this, and the situation in the South is getting worse day by day. Student National Goods Year has been silent since its opening. The waves of advocating domestic goods have also quieted down like hibernation. Various domestic goods factories are struggling desperately under the cold faces of firms. On the other hand, the activities of Japanese merchants are secretly creeping in like pickpockets. This newspaper carried a news item on the 9th about the activities of Japanese merchants in China. In order to develop trade with China and promote the sale of Japanese goods, Japanese manufacturers in Osaka and major merchants have jointly organized 26 manufacturers of hardware, machinery, electrical materials, stationery, fountain pens, book materials, pumps, engines, groceries, oil paper, cosmetics, waterproof materials, automobiles, phonographs, and mining businesses, who will come to China to inspect Shanghai, Nanjing, and the Yangtze River area. The aim is to see what kind of goods China needs and then prepare Japanese goods to be sold in China. Therefore, the Yangtze River liners of Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, which had been suspended, have now resumed service one after another, and there is a great trend to restore the prosperity before January 28th. I don't know if people who advocate domestic goods are moved by this news? They are inspecting, holding meetings, and creeping in secretly, gaining an inch. We are still only knowing selfishness, being muddle-headed, half-senile, and not asking or hearing. What is the intention, what is the heart?</p>
<h3 id="e202">National Goods and Industrial and Technological Salvation <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Bei Qiu</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, the four flower tiles of "spring, summer, autumn, and winter" in mahjong seemed to have been cancelled. Whenever the tiles were turned over, it was always "Recovering Rights" or "Revitalizing Industry". At that time, these eight characters could be seen in newspapers every day, people often talked about these eight characters, and people's letters all contained these eight characters. These eight characters were really popular for a while, almost more modern than the two characters "modern" are now!</p>
<p>Until now - taking the Women's National Goods Year as an example, I feel that people's hearts have changed greatly. People love to use foreign goods, letters love to write foreign words, what Paris perfume, what foreign face powder, what... what..., all of this has alarming import surplus figures!</p>
<p>So Mr. Wu Zhihui loudly called out: "Industrial and Technological Salvation!" This means that if our industry and technology can be as developed as those of foreign countries, so that Chinese people can use their own things themselves and do not have to rely on foreign goods, then China can be saved. However, can industry and technology really save the country? We see that the use of electricity in China has been very developed, such as electric facial massages, electric hair perms, electric executions, etc. Who can say that this is for saving the country! This is just a waste of electricity!</p>
<p>Of course, there are also proper uses of electricity, such as electric fans, which can change the climate and make a great contribution to mankind. Moreover, electric fans with this trademark are already popular all over the world. They have been to India, Africa, and the South Seas. They have indeed won a ray of dawn for the Chinese national industrial community, and at the same time, they have fulfilled their obligations to save the country.</p>
<p>Comparing these two, the conclusion is more obvious. Developing industry and technology cannot necessarily save the country, but developing industry and technology can indeed save the country. This is to see what kind of industry and technology is developed. If the development of a kind of industry and technology that is useless to mankind cannot save the country, if the development of an industry and technology that is beneficial to mankind, such as the Hua Sheng electric fan, can save the country.</p>
<p>However, things are not entirely good. If the Hua Sheng electric fan does not have so many types - shaking fans, circulating table fans, wooden blade circulating ceiling fans, circulating air blowers, train fans, etc.: if the Hua Sheng electric fan does not have so many advantages - it only uses 75 watts of electricity per hour (16-inch shaking table fan), and it can rotate more than 1,250 revolutions per minute, and it will not burn even after being opened for the longest time, and at the same time, the price is cheap; if electricity does not have the above two conditions, foreign electric fans will definitely replace it and will never let its footprints spread all over the world.</p>
<p>Therefore, under the slogan of "Industrial and Technological Salvation", we should pay attention to the fact that we must develop industry and technology that is beneficial to mankind, and we must develop industry and technology to the point where foreign goods cannot compete. Only such industry and technology is worthy of being called "Industrial and Technological Salvation" or "Saving Industry and Technology"!</p>
<h3 id="e203">How to Make "Student National Goods Year" Emit Great Power? <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Yi Guan Zhu</p>
<p>This year is the "Student National Goods Year"! Everyone already knows this. But how can we make this "Student National Goods Year" emit great power? Few people have discussed this. Now I will not hesitate to talk about this issue.</p>
<p>(1) In terms of the family: I think that the position of "students" in the family is "children". Those who instruct children are parents. This is something that teachers cannot reach. Then, parents should understand this point. Their children are "students" in school anyway. Now that it is "Student National Goods Year", they should "lead by example" everywhere and instruct their children to use "domestic goods".</p>
<p>(2) In terms of the school: Children are "students" in school. Those who instruct students are teachers. Naturally, parents cannot control this. In other words, parents have completely delegated the responsibility of instructing their children to the teachers. Then, the teachers should understand this point even more. Since this year is the "Student National Goods Year" and they are in a position to instruct students, they should "lead by example" everywhere and instruct their students to use "domestic goods".</p>
<p>I think that if the parents and teachers can really recognize their responsibilities and work together according to the above methods, instructing and supervising each other at all times, then this "Student National Goods Year" will emit great power - the reasons are also the following two.</p>
<p>(1) In this way, students can have a deep impression of "domestic goods" in their minds, so that they will not forget it as soon as they turn around, and then they can gradually transfer their belief in "foreign goods" to "domestic goods" and use "domestic goods" forever.</p>
<p>(2) It must be known that "Student National Goods Year" is just a "year number" of the national goods movement, and the responsibility of using "domestic goods" is not just limited to students. The practical significance is still that people from all walks of life need to work hard. If, as mentioned above, the instructing methods can be truly "leading by example" for parents and instructing their children to use "domestic goods", then all walks of life can be reached. Because the parents of students are not necessarily people in the academic world, farmers, industrialists, and businessmen can all "lead by example", which means that everyone can use "domestic goods". Isn't this power even greater? Alas! In short, I hope everyone works hard!</p>
<h3 id="e204">Worth Introducing Educational Toys <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Shui</p>
<p>Children are the future masters of the entire nation, the most important fundamental elements in organizing a people. Therefore, all countries attach extreme importance to children's education. The stronger the country, the more perfect the children's education. Unlike the casual treatment of children common in our country, with people thinking children's actions are insignificant, even believing that reading, writing, and all other training are merely "little monks chanting scriptures, without sincerity." Thus, they are never corrected, always thinking that when the time comes when they are needed, they will strive to improve. This view is a great mistake. We should understand that children allowed to be indulgent from a young age will "form habits naturally," and even at a considerable age, it will not be easy to change. As the saying goes, "What is meant at three lasts till old age," which is the principle.</p>
<p>Now, our country is gradually paying more attention to children's education. The "Children's Year," which has been shouted for a long time, will finally open under the leadership of the government in early August of this year. This is certainly good news for children across the country. However, we know that whenever a year is designated for something, there must be a task for that year. The mission and task of Children's Year are, of course, to seek happiness for children nationwide. For children, it is to improve their lives, eliminate all bad habits, and shape all children nationwide into complete individuals of the future.</p>
<p>To accomplish this mission of "Children's Year," the only way to start is through education. However, children's education, in addition to books, still needs the assistance of play, because children's lives are mostly about play. Therefore, we should guide children through play, educate children through play. This requires appropriate "toys."</p>
<p>Since toys occupy such an important position in children's education, toys suitable for education have emerged. Here, the reporter wants to introduce a factory specializing in the production of educational toys—the China Educational Toy Factory. Their products are suitable for the purpose of children's education everywhere, capable of directly or indirectly influencing children's emotions, thoughts, character, as well as training in knowledge and skills. Now, the factory's various products are classified and recorded below for selection by the education community or parents.</p>
<p>(1) Transportation: cars, trams, trains, etc.</p>
<p>(2) Military: tanks, armored vehicles, airplanes, small cannons, etc.</p>
<p>(3) Animals: chickens pecking rice, dancing ducks, seals, etc.</p>
<p>(4) Musical Instruments: copper drums, trumpets, rattles, jingles, etc.</p>
<p>(5) Utensils: cookware, fragrant baskets, lead buckets, ticket holders, etc.</p>
<p>Although only a few categories are listed above, they include everything. Each item suits children's psychology. Whether boys or girls, they can arouse interest, inspire wisdom, and are made of sturdy iron, durable to play with. Hygiene, safety, and economy are all taken into consideration. This is not the reporter exaggerating his promotion, but because the materials are excellent, the thinking is precise, and it contributes to children's education, it is indeed worth introducing.</p>
<p>In the past six months, the total number of foreign toy imports was 292,195 gold units, equivalent to 577,962 yuan in national currency. Now that we have such excellent domestic toys, perhaps we can reduce some leakage. This is what the reporter eagerly hopes for.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Domestic Goods Industry and Finance <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Zhao</p>
<p>The new initiatives decided by the Shanghai financial community this year are: (1) no foreign rice financing; (2) no credit loans for merchants purchasing foreign goods, especially those selling luxury goods. This is truly an awakening of the financial industry.</p>
<p>The result of years of import surplus is the withering of people's livelihoods. In rural areas and cities, almost all face the danger of not being able to survive today. The only key lies in the large-scale dumping of foreign goods, and the constant westward flow of silver, leading to today's dangerous situation. Although the blame lies with the import merchants' greed for profit, and consumers' drinking poison to quench their thirst! But indirectly facilitating import merchants, promoting economic aggression by powerful countries, and self-depriving the nation's wealth, can the financial industry, which controls the power to regulate surpluses and deficits, evade its responsibility?</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Wang Chusheng, in the article "New Initiatives of the Financial Industry" in the Shanghai Money Industry Monthly, Volume 15, Number 3, has many alarming words. He said, "In recent years, there are more imports and fewer exports. Thus, it is only a one-sided work, which is to pay for the goods for the importers, but cannot absorb foreign capital for the exporters. Under this kind of abnormal state, the financial community is like a bird's nest on a dangerous curtain, how can it last long. Even though issuing loans is one of the business of the bank, the power to examine and choose is controlled by the bank. How can we just chase profit and give convenience to the importers, so as to help foreigners' economic aggression. Although I don't kill Boren, Boren dies because of me." Mr. Wang also made two hopes: (1) All merchants purchasing foreign goods will not be given loans, regardless of whether they sell luxury goods or not; (2) The banking industry and the money industry should stand on the same front and take the same steps. Then, even if the merchants purchasing foreign goods want to sell goods for foreigners, their power is just so-so. The words are truly accurate.</p>
<p>As a member of the domestic goods industry, I urgently hope that our domestic goods industry will jointly support the new initiatives of the financial industry, and move forward hand in hand! And for the future of our domestic goods, open a new opportunity, especially hope that the gentlemen in the financial industry, those who talk should get up and act.</p>

<p>Patriotic Goods Speech</p>
<h3 id="e207">Record of Mr. Chen Diaofu's Speech <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Lü Bin</p>
<p>—Manager of Yongli Chemical Industry Company—</p>
<p>After the September 18th National Crisis, the Ministry of Industry once drafted a plan to establish a large-scale sulfuric acid factory for manufacturing fertilizer to develop national industry, resist foreign goods, and reduce leakage. At that time, because of China's economic shortfalls, there was not so much capital to start. So, it was prepared to jointly run with the UK and Germany, using their capital to develop our local business. Experts from the UK and Germany were invited to design together with our country's industrial experts. Mr. Chen Diaofu was also one of them. Later, the UK and Germany had no sincerity. They thought that if they helped China develop this kind of business, it would affect the sales of their foreign goods in China. Therefore, they wanted to manipulate and control it, wanting to grab this kind of business in their hands and not let China have sovereignty. Their long-standing intention to invade can be imagined. Therefore, Mr. Chen Diaofu believed that state-owned enterprises must not be controlled by foreigners. If so, wouldn't it be giving foreigners further aggression? So, he asked the Ministry of Industry to start it independently. The Ministry of Industry, due to financial difficulties, asked Mr. Chen's Yongli Chemical Industry Company to handle it. Mr. Chen tried to negotiate with the Shanghai banking community, and got the approval of the banking community. So, it was decided to use domestic capital to set up a sulfuric acid manufacturing plant in Xiejiatian, located between Liuhe County and Pukou on the north bank of the Yangtze River. Now, preparations have been completed and are actively underway, and it will soon be started.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen enjoys a great reputation in the domestic goods industry in the country. For the worker education problem in the factory, he went to Wuxi the day before yesterday to visit Mr. Gao Jiansi, the president of the Education Institute, to discuss how to run labor education in the factory, and took the opportunity to give a speech. We were able to see his demeanor and hear him talk about important information about Yongli Chemical Industry Company.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen said that the alkali plant he ran in Tanggu, Tianjin, has been more than ten years. It manufactures three kinds of pure alkali (sodium carbonate), caustic soda (sodium hydroxide), and clean alkali (sodium bicarbonate). Bread, fried dough sticks, papermaking, glasses, dyeing, etc., all need alkali. The domestic consumption alone is a large number. In the past, they were all purchased from the British Imperial Chemical Industries Company, and there were many losses every year. After their alkali manufacturing company was established, they resisted British goods. The alkali materials used in the country are all their products. Not only are they sold in the domestic market, but they are also transported to Japan. Japan's alkali manufacturing industry is not as good as China's. It is estimated that they can recover 5 million yuan of rights and interests every year.</p>
<p>He also said that his purpose of running this kind of industry is not for personal gain, but to focus on national industry, to serve the domestic goods industry, in order to develop the domestic national capital industry. He said that all the products of their alkali manufacturing company have a position in the world. It is the glory of the Chinese domestic goods industry, not personal glory. If it is based on personal interests to start a business, there is really not much meaning. These words are extremely thorough! The reason why our Chinese domestic goods business cannot develop is because of short-sightedness, unable to focus on the big picture, only seeking personal gain.</p>
<p>He also said that to manufacture domestic goods, we must use domestic raw materials. For example, the most important raw material for manufacturing sulfuric acid is sulfur. According to his investigation, Hunan has the most sulfur production. So, he also planned how to develop Hunan's sulfur mines.</p>
<p>Finally, he talked about that in addition to the existing alkali manufacturing company and the sulfuric acid plant under construction, Yongli Chemical Industry Company will also run a ammonia plant, manufacturing ammonia: an acid plant, manufacturing sulfuric acid, nitric acid. Because the need for these raw materials to manufacture many goods are large in quantity. If we do not actively do it ourselves, money will flow out every day. If this continues, there will never be a time to save it.</p>

<p>— (Cheng Zhenru)</p>
<p>Silkworm moths are sexually promiscuous. Since they crawl out of the cocoon, they flutter their wings to find the opposite sex. Suddenly mating and laying eggs, the male dies first after mating, and the female also dies after laying eggs. You see its short life of one or twenty hours after becoming a moth, as if it is only for sexual intercourse and laying eggs.</p>
<p>Isn't life a hundred years just a moment? Instead of taking advantage of this precious time to work hard on a vigorous career that benefits the country and the people, and focusing on "abundant offspring" and "continuous melons and silkworms," waiting for woe is me, this kind of life meaning is like a reproductive machine, and what is the difference with a sexually promiscuous silkworm moth?</p>
<p>Although the words are said like this, in the vast universe, how many people can escape this kind of silkworm moth-like life?</p>
<h3 id="e209">Hilsa Herring Talk <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Shijiu</p>
<p>The Hilsa herring, hated by Su Dongpo for being "bony," is now on the market. Hilsa herring from the Fuchun River are the best. Everyone knows this, it seems unnecessary to say more; but why the Hilsa herring from the Fuchun River can be famous and renowned, there is still a small anecdote in the middle, which is described as follows:</p>
<p>Hilsa herring are originally sea creatures, but every spring, they must go to freshwater rivers and swim for a long time. It is said that their biggest purpose is to spawn. Therefore, once the spring river warms up, they all abandon their old homes; it seems that they cannot get used to that sea life, and they must move to a better place and swim into the river to live.</p>
<p>There is a Zhizi Gate—commonly known as Zhizi Gate—in the Qiantang River—mountain peaks stand on both sides, and when the tide reaches there, it is blocked, and there is a view of surging rocks and shallow waters, so that place is the best place to watch the tide in August. When scaly fish arrive at Zhizi Gate, probably due to lack of strength, or because they love the surging tide there, they lie in the river to spawn, completing their task of passing on the species.</p>
<p>After the task is completed, they go up the river. When they arrive at the Fuchun River, they are living leisurely and contentedly. Unexpectedly, there is a generation of people who like to feast, because those mother fish are weak after production and easy to catch, they wait for the opportunity, and a seasonal fresh product is added to the knife board. The Hilsa herring caught at this time is the freshest and most expensive, not something poor scholars can afford. If they luckily escape the net, go upstream, and then go downstream, and are caught again, their meat will be old, and they will not be valued.</p>
<p>The above was described by a Fuyang friend, so I recorded it.</p>

<p>— Chonglou</p>
<p>People who grew up in old families are mostly weak.</p>
<p>In the past year, in the letters I wrote home, I always advised my older brother and sister to pay attention to exercise and strengthen their bodies. —</p>
<p>Perhaps these words will touch their hearts after a long time. Recently, I received a letter from my younger sister, saying that they are already preparing to set up a family tennis court.</p>
<p>Hearing that they want to implement fitness, I feel very happy in my heart; but I know that sports equipment in my hometown is inferior and expensive, so I spent half a day selecting four rackets, a net, and two dozen balls for them, and sent them back by mail.</p>
<p>At the same time, in the letter I sent to them, in addition to roughly stating some opinions on the setting of the court and the method of practice, I also wrote to them: "...With a healthy body, you can have a lively spirit. ...Health is really priceless! For it, don't be stingy with some time!..."</p>
<p>Indeed, among all sports, tennis is more interesting; and it has an average development for wrist strength, foot strength, eyesight, and various parts of the body. When I was in school, I was a "tennis fan"; but now because of the busyness of work, I rarely have the opportunity to play it. Although there is a new court in my hometown family now, I am far away in another country, and I can't help but feel a little sad!</p>

<p>— You Si</p>
<p>Last year was called the Women's Patriotic Goods Year. At first, it was also very prominent for a while, such as performing from time to time, cloth clothing movements, holding meetings and parades, writing articles and giving speeches. The sound of advocating patriotic goods was very loud. After a while, the cicada dragged its remaining sound and competed on another branch. It was as light as clouds and smoke, and no traces could be found. Only at the end of the year, when summarizing the accounts, it can be seen from the statistics of foreign goods entering the super that the consumption of cosmetics and luxury goods imported by foreign ships by Chinese women is an absolute huge number. It seems that the final failure of domestic goods, Chinese women also contributed to it, and it is inevitable to fail the good name of this Women's Patriotic Goods Year. Now a year is easy. It has been renamed the Student National Goods Year, and it will be seen that the advocacy of domestic goods this year has been entrusted with the responsibility. However, it is hoped that young and handsome students will make special efforts, and it will be increasingly irrelevant to the women's circle who are addicted to modernism. This is really regrettable and worrisome!</p>
<p>Since the beginning of spring, the major silk shops in Shanghai, in order to resist the dumping policy of foreign goods, have tried their best to stop leakage and recover rights and interests, all holding a low-profit principle and selling at low prices. Sure enough, the vision and psychology of the Chinese people have greatly changed. For a time, the silk industry was quite vigorous and energetic, which is a rare good phenomenon in recent years. However, looking back at the decline of domestic commerce, the economic distress, the tragic decline in the value of raw silk, as well as the decline of silk factories, and the outer strength and inner dryness of silk weaving factories, learning from the past and being careful in the future, creating great pain and deep pain, looking forward to the future, there are still many thorns, and there is still no room for optimism. Nurturing vitality and jointly maintaining the foundation of the country is waiting for our efforts to fight. Recently, I heard that Lao Jiuzhang Silk Fabric Bureau on Nanjing Road in this port has realized this, and also thought that the women's circle has a very close relationship with domestic silk fabrics. Therefore, it is planned to publish a special issue in the bureau in the near future, and solicit articles from the women's circle universally. All literary and artistic creations are welcome. The purpose is especially to solicit the opinions of the women's circle on the use of domestic silk fabrics, so as to measure the psychological experience, have something to follow, make the grade fabric products more refined and better, and achieve the goal of being beautiful and perfect for everyone to use. Once published. Exquisite silk fabrics will be given as a gift to answer the elegance. It is expected that after the publication of this book, it will be a special highlight for the Chinese silk industry. (It is heard that the publication is currently in the soliciting period. It is hoped that women comrades will not be stingy with their pearls and jade. Give generous articles. In order to collect ideas and learn from others. However, in order to understand the true opinions of the women's circle. It is best to attach a photo of yourself).</p>

<p>— (Ji Yun)</p>
<p>Frenchman Shan Luoqiu is the director of the French Experimental Surgical Research Institute, and has the secret method of rejuvenation, which is famous in Europe and America. Recently, he took his 21-year-old wife on a honeymoon trip to Japan. Staying in the Imperial Hotel, three rooms with 50 yuan a day were opened, and the behavior was extravagant, so the Japanese paid close attention to him.</p>
<p>Dr. Jia is very rich, and the couple lives in Colimtai City on the border between Italy and France. Many gorillas and apes are kept at home for research. They live in the countryside in summer and move to Paris in winter. There are five cars for moving. The doctor is 65 years old this year. Although his hair is slightly white, he still looks like a young man. In terms of age, his beautiful and young wife can only be his granddaughter. According to the doctor, the method of rejuvenation is like grafting a sweet persimmon branch onto an astringent persimmon tree, and then you can grow sweet persimmons. Implanting the testicles of gorillas or apes on the human body can rejuvenate, but the method is not as simple as grafting trees. A reporter asked if his wife had had surgery. The doctor replied that she was only twenty-one years old, and if she had surgery, she would not be able to bear children.</p>
<p>The doctor claimed that he had never tried the rejuvenation surgery himself. But he has used surgery on his younger brother, and he has indeed rejuvenated for ten years. It is said that surgery can be used about once every ten years.</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Qingdeling, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>I remember that the first time I followed the Empress Dowager, the Empress Dowager also talked to me in detail. "It may surprise you! Every time we make a pair of shoes, from the beginning of the sample to the complete completion, it must take at least a month." The Empress Dowager first said to me, "This is really a very troublesome project, and there are indeed many procedures involved! Even these girls, you can't underestimate them! Their skills are extremely skilled, and the workers outside can't compare to them!...First, they always have to draw a shoe pattern on white paper: drawing a shoe pattern is a very thoughtful project, and all aspects must be taken care of. Such as shoe material style, pattern, etc..., nothing must be properly considered and configured in order to be appropriate; and among them, the height of the heel should be determined first..."</p>
<p>Then, she and I specifically discussed the heel. —The heel here refers specifically to the high-heeled shoes worn by women in Manchuria at the beginning. (This kind of high-heeled shoes is commonly called flag shoes. Their style is similar to the high-heeled shoes worn by women in Middle Earth, except that the head is not pointed, and a wooden heel is installed under the sole. But the position of this wooden heel is not on the heel at the back, but in the middle of the sole; people wearing this kind of high-heeled shoes walk, it is really like stepping on a pair of low stilts, with a unique flowing posture.) —The height of this kind of heel must correspond to the thickness of the sole above and the style of the shoes; a certain kind of sole must be matched with a certain size of wooden heel, which must be carefully studied, otherwise the wearer will feel uncomfortable, and even feel pain.

<h3 id="e215">A Trip to Longhua <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Huanbing</p>
<p>On Sunday afternoon, I was dismissed from duty at just the right time—four o'clock. My heart, weighed down by the pressures of my environment, sluggish and devoid of the excitement a young person should have, received a bit of a baptism in the warm sunlight, and surprisingly, I felt a stirring of life. Dragging my leaden feet, I wandered aimlessly forward. Before I knew it, I was in the old western district. Every shop doorway was filled with the sounds of music, and the sidewalks were crowded with people coming and going, a scene of peaceful prosperity.</p>
<p>I had just stopped when a shiny, new public bus, freshly painted by the municipal public utility bureau and specifically for the Longhua line, pulled up. A large group of people poured out of the bus, most of them holding a bunch of peach blossoms in their hands, the petals falling off with a rustling sound from the jostling—how cruel, I thought. Then another large group boarded the bus. I called out to two younger colleagues, "We have nothing to do anyway, let's go have some fun!"</p>
<p>The bus drove smoothly on the road, the gravel road, the cinder road, passing Gaochang Temple, Nanyang Middle School, and Xiaomu Bridge. All along the way were rural scenes. The golden rapeseed flowers were so lovely. A small stream meandered in front of us, winding and turning, and I wondered where it led. Across the stream was a magnificent vista of spring. "One willow, one peach," the ancient poem perfectly captured the scene. Behind the dense layers of peach and willow trees, stood a delicate pagoda, sadly worn and dilapidated with age, but all the more ancient and quaint for it.</p>
<p>We had arrived at Longhua, our destination. Everyone got off the bus. Sure enough, there were many tourists: old ladies with yellow cloth bags, devoutly burning incense; fashionable gentlemen and ladies out for a stroll; groups of mischievous elementary school students; and some, bored and hoping to find a bit of inspiration and comfort. We walked into the main gate of the ancient temple, where vendors were hawking their wares on the incense and candle stands. In front of the main hall, a lay Buddhist of unknown name was gesticulating and expounding the scriptures, surrounded by a large crowd of devout men and women listening intently. The Three Buddhas in the Hall of the Great Hero were being gilded, and the five hundred majestic statues in the Hall of Arhats were solemn, reverent, inspiring spontaneous respect.</p>
<p>The buildings around the main hall had been renovated. Although they were simple, they were a complete change from the dilapidated state of the past. We walked around the temple once and then left.</p>
<p>Outside the temple gate, it wasn't far to the airfield via the railway station. In this vast open space, at twilight, I walked along, imagining the sound of airplanes rumbling overhead, our brave soldiers skillfully flying light fighter planes in neat formations, singing the stirring anthem "Return Our Glorious Rivers and Mountains," a triumphant song filled with fervor.</p>
<p>The scenery of the Southern Huangpu was beautiful. The white sails of boats moved across the water. The shadows of the three of us stood on the beach, listening to the sound of the river tide crashing in the wind. Infinite thoughts surged in our hearts, and the curtain of night was closing in around us!</p>

<p>Chapter 11: A Sad Conversation Reveals That Life is But a Dream; Random Footprints Show How Cruel the Wind and Rain Are</p>
<p>Zhiqian thought to himself, matchmaking isn't like putting out a fire, so why are these two women struggling so desperately in the rain, coming and going? There must be something wrong. Since it's raining anyway, and I can't meet with friends, I'm going to stay by the window and see what's going on. Thinking this, he stayed in the room, never leaving the window. Sure enough, less than half an hour later, three women arrived. Leading the way were Sister-in-law Hu and the woman who had left earlier, sharing an umbrella. Behind them was the young girl Zhu Yueying, holding her own umbrella. As Sister-in-law Hu walked, she kept talking. Behind the glass, her words were unclear, but Yueying seemed to be responding constantly. It seemed she was directing her to do something. Zhiqian thought that in the oblique wind and drizzle, they were hurriedly making contact, definitely to bring Yueying here. Could it be that someone wants to take her away from Xi'an? But Xi'an is a place where you can only travel by land, and when it rains, sedans, cars, and mules can't move. Why the rush? Besides, what other reason would there be for such a hurry? Unable to figure it out, Zhiqian refused to let go. He immediately ran out of the room and stood under the veranda. They were in the courtyard, following the brick path around the corner of the house, just coming over. (179)</p>

<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw overseas silver markets rising across the board. The morning opened with further declines, but market sentiment was still good. The foreign exchange market, which had been tight, eased, and the overdrafts continued to dry up, making a rebound easy. Trading in the morning remained inactive, with supply and demand very average and prices fluctuating without direction, resulting in a slight decline. At the start of the morning, overseas silver markets in both the UK and US were up, but there was talk of a seller hanging a price of 0.0625 lower than the posted price after the close. Silver for forward delivery in Montreaux rose sharply. Foreign exchange rates rose slightly, London spot gold fell 9.5 pence, and off-exchange forward trading fell to 63.75 yuan. Buyers became active at lower prices, and prices rose accordingly. The Central Bank's posted rate was announced, with the pound unchanged and the US dollar up 0.0625. The customs gold unit fell by one cent, and the gold standard fell to 900.4 yuan. The morning opened on a low note, with Jewish merchants Qiao Zhinan actively buying. The domestic US dollar market gradually tightened, and buyers surged in after the opening, causing prices to rise. However, because banks took the opportunity to sell at high prices, the rise was temporary, and prices fell back. Upon learning that the HSBC posted rate was unchanged for the pound and up 0.0625 for the US dollar, there was some fluctuation, but after the Central Bank showed willingness to sell US dollars, and the Bank of Japan also divested, prices once fell. However, banks seized the opportunity to buy at lower prices, and buyers were also active at the lower levels. Soon, prices rose again. Although Sassoon suddenly showed a desire to sell, causing a temporary decline, the banks' appetite remained strong. There were not many transactions in the market, and short positions were covered, keeping the overall trend stable. Finally, the price rose slightly because the Bank of China intended to cover US dollars, and the market closed steady. Trading in the morning was initially weak but strengthened later, with tight positions, but the continued weakness in forward contracts made it difficult for market sentiment to improve, and the market remained dull. The morning's market activity is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opened at 865.3 yuan, down 1.8 yuan from the previous close. Huixiang, Fuyu, Dadecheng, Hengyu, Yingxiang, Yuanheng and others came. Hengyu and Fuxing Yong sold contracts, and with uncertain sentiment, the price fell to 5 yuan. Jinlong, Yingxiang, Yuanmao, Yongchang, and Da Shang Na rose to 6.4 yuan. Upon learning that the HSBC posted rate was unchanged for the pound and up 0.0625 for the US dollar, the situation stabilized. The Central Bank suddenly offered 43,750 US dollars for July delivery, and Wanxing Dafa Yonghengyu sold to 4 yuan, with a profit on the June sterling at 625. Yingxiang Hengchang Yongjin rose to 5.2 yuan, and Hengyu, Dadecheng, Changda and others sold contracts in succession. Mitsui also sold June sterling at 25, falling to 3.5 yuan. Yuqing Yongfu and Yong Wanxing Hengyu Hanheng Yuanmao Yongheng Changyong Jinlong Dafa Yong all bought, gradually rising back to 6.6 yuan. Sassoon suddenly showed a real intention to sell, and Huixiang Yuanchang Yonghengyu Dadecheng Fuyu took the opportunity to sell at high prices, retreating to 4.2 yuan. Fuyu Yicheng Shunmao Yuqing Yongjin Longlai entered the market, and prices rose again to 7.5 yuan. Sassoon offered April sterling at 75, and Lifeng Yu Yingxiang sold, falling back to 4.9 yuan. Zhengjin bought May US dollars at 6875, and Richang Fuxing Yongda Fengzhengchang Shunzang Yongli and others maintained prices. There was talk of China's intention to buy April US dollars at 125, rising to 6.9 yuan. Dafa Yong and others supplied at high prices, and the midday close was 866.1 yuan. After the close, prices were flat, hovering around 6 yuan. The highest price for the morning was 868 yuan, and the lowest price was 863.5 yuan, with a fluctuation of 4.5 yuan.

<h3 id="e220">Securities: The Floating of the 96 Bonds Was Excessive, the Line Was Shaking, and It Fell Another Half Yuan, Restoring Prices Before the Holiday <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>At the Chinese Securities Exchange, the market was mostly weak. Because the loans from the bottom of April were about to expire and could not be renewed, market sentiment turned weak. The storm over the 96 bonds had passed, and things were gradually stabilizing. The so-called reorganization was still unknown. It was heard that although the Ministry of Finance intended to reorganize, the time was not yet right. Even if it were reorganized, the conditions would probably not satisfy the bondholders. Therefore, the floating of bonds was excessive, and people continued to sell. Market prices continued to fall, and were equal to the market prices before the spring festival. The bubble had burst and become a thing of the past. However, there were many short positions, so it was probably not easy to fall quickly. Other types of trading were more active, with large accounts slightly entering and exiting. The trend was mostly declining due to supply exceeding demand. Northern bonds were slightly covered, and 43 bonds and retail investors were very active in selling. 16 and 35 bonds were gradually buying in, and the situation may fluctuate. Because the environment and news were dull, hedging trades were rare, so it was not easy to have any fluctuations. In summary, the market price results showed that only the allocated bonds for this month were slightly better by 5 fen, while the rest consistently declined, from 5 fen 1 jiao to 3 or 4 jiao. 9 points consistently weakened, from small 5 jiao to 6 jiao and a half. The closing price for this month was slightly better by 1 jiao, but the future still has fluctuations. The total number of contracts traded was 11,000,006 yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>Xinhua Foreign Firm reported that yesterday (9th) the New York stock market initially remained mixed. However, due to favorable commercial reports and slightly increased investor demand, coupled with short covering, the market showed a strong upward trend. American Telephone and Telegraph, General Electric, and automobile stocks were particularly favored by investors. Another notable feature of the market was the very strong performance of silver stocks, as silver prices approached the Treasury Department's purchasing price for newly mined silver. Senator Ikeman believed that this Congress had hopes of enacting legislation to aid railroads, so railroad stocks turned firmer. Bond markets were mixed, and small exchange stocks also showed fluctuating gains and losses. Total trading volume for the day was 860,000 shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>
<p>Date | April 8th | April 9th | Change</p>

<p>The yarn market initially leveled off, then fell, and the market attitude became softer. This was due to the weakening demand from customers, causing sudden uncertainty. The overseas cotton yarn situation initially rose, then fell, but remained strong in the afternoon, further dampening market sentiment and causing some selling pressure. However, the current yarn situation was still good, and factory inventories were lower than before, so the market could still be stabilized.</p>
<p>Golden Chicken 平疲 [Unclear meaning, possibly weak/flat]</p>
<p>In the morning opening of the marked yarn market, prices continued to rise across all months. Due to the persistent rise in overseas cotton markets, there was a lack of supply from sellers, and prices rose by 3, 4, 5, and 6 jiao across all months. However, by the second and third rounds of bidding, prices turned down again. It was heard that current yarn transactions may have stagnated, with sluggish purchasing from all parties and a relaxed atmosphere. As a result, prices for all months were up 1 or 2 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon opening, although market transactions were not smooth, the "tai feng" (Unclear meaning, possibly related to market wind) was largely loose, and the market weakened. According to market sources, a certain yarn had begun to be shipped, causing competitive sales, and people became alarmed. However, by the close, prices rose slightly by 2 or 3 jiao. As a result, prices for all months were down 1, 3, 4, and 5 jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Tongji sold 300 bales, Yida sold 300 bales, Dachangcheng sold 250 bales, Hengchang sold 750 bales, Xinhua sold 700 bales, Junchang sold 400 bales, Changyu sold 650 bales, and Run Kang sold 750 bales. Yuanda bought 300 bales, Tongji bought 500 bales, Taichang bought 250 bales, Changfeng bought 1250 bales, Dachang bought 600 bales, Ruidang bought 900 bales, and Tongfeng bought 350 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Yarn Type | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Closing Price | Change | Inventory Balance</p>

<p>Spot Sales Suddenly Decreased</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales were relatively sluggish. Statistics for the day showed that all parties bought a total of 735 bales. Prices were stable. The purchase amounts for each party are as follows:</p>
<p>Inland: 20, Shantou: 80, Guangdong: 365, Ningbo: 5</p>

<p>Cotton market trends show morning gains and afternoon declines, resulting in a fluctuating situation. However, American cotton continues to rise, with far-month contracts breaking through the 11.1-cent barrier. Indian cotton is also showing strong upward momentum, leading to hopes for a positive market outlook. Unfortunately, Shanghai and various producing areas have excessively large cotton inventories. The deadline for mortgaging these inventories expires at the end of March on the lunar calendar. With such a large volume of stocks, merchants find it difficult to maintain a bullish outlook.</p>
<p>Fluctuations in Zheng Biao (Cotton Exchange)</p>
<p>At the opening of the cotton exchange, all months showed active trading. This was due to the continued rise in American cotton by over ten points, Indian cotton by two to three rupees, and stable gold prices. Market sentiment was generally positive. While buyers were not overly enthusiastic, new sellers were scarce, and the current month's momentum felt strong. Both buyers and sellers engaged in fierce competition. As a result, prices for all months rose by 1.1 to 2.0 "jiao" (a unit of currency) compared to the previous day's closing price. However, the market suddenly declined after the afternoon opening, creating a sense of panic. Market rumors suggested that a certain merchant was dumping cotton. An investigation revealed that Ningbo Hefeng Factory had slightly reduced its holdings for the current month, while Tongcheng Company had stepped in to buy. Consequently, prices for all months fell by 0.5 to 1.5 "jiao" compared to the morning closing price. Despite this, the black market price of Indian cotton rose by another 2.5 rupees. Sales included: Xincheng 1,300 "dan" (a unit of weight), Shengyuan 1,100 "dan," Runkang 5,700 "dan," Jifeng 1,100 "dan," Dachang 2,700 "dan," Yicheng 2,000 "dan," Taichang 1,000 "dan," and Changfeng 2,200 "dan." Purchases included: Yongda 1,200 "dan," Gengfeng 1,400 "dan," Changji 1,300 "dan," Tongxing 1,100 "dan," Runkang 3,000 "dan," Dafu 2,200 "dan," Dafeng 1,200 "dan," Yuanda 1,400 "niu" (likely a typo, should be "dan"), Yuanda 1,400 "niu," Yichang 1,800 "dan," and Xiecheng 1,100 "dan." The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened higher due to positive news from Liverpool. Trading houses and foreign firms were actively buying. Liverpool primarily focused on old cotton. Prices for all months rose by 3 to 4 points. Subsequently, prices weakened slightly due to profit-taking by bulls and local selling. Senator Pee Mies's statement regarding new cotton loans was beneficial. However, trading houses remained skeptical due to inconsistencies between the government's legislative and administrative policies on new cotton. Officials from the Agricultural Adjustment Administration estimated that the current year's adjustment plan would cost US$555 million. Near the close, prices surged because Wall Street firms bought, and short sellers, encouraged by the possibility of ample funds from the Public Works program, rushed to cover their positions. At the same time, spot traders actively purchased old cotton, causing prices to rise sharply. Spot prices rose by 15 points, and futures prices rose by 12 to 17 points. British cotton spot prices rose by 8 points, and futures prices rose by 4 to 5 points. Indian cotton initially weakened due to selling by European exporters but later rose due to positive news from Liverpool and widespread buying. Pingguole rose by 1.75 rupees, Aomula rose by 1.5 to 3.5 rupees, and Bai Luo Xi rose by 2.25 to 3.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (9th Telegram)</p>

<p>The number of cotton yarn exports in late March was 5,309 bales for Japanese yarn, an increase of 2,700 bales compared to the 2,605 bales in mid-March. Chinese yarn exports were 16,918 bales, an increase of 4,340 bales compared to the 12,578 bales in mid-March. The increase in Chinese yarn sales is attributed to seasonal factors in the spring. Japanese yarn exports remain weak due to unfavorable exchange rates. The quantity of exports by transportation method and location is listed below (in bales):</p>

<p>Both morning and afternoon trading sessions in the flour market saw steady gains. This was due to continuous small-scale sales by northern merchants, active buying, and the market's establishment of immigration stations. Yesterday, factories firmly held back supply, while spot merchants not only drew from existing flour stocks but also absorbed near- and far-term futures. Speculators, citing unfavorable weather conditions, refrained from selling, and active trading by speculators further drove up prices. As a result, prices for April and May rose by a half, June by 1.25, and September by 1.0.</p>
<p>Wheat market prices remained stable initially for both near- and far-term contracts. Foreign wheat prices in Chicago fell by about 1 "jiao," while Canadian wheat rose sharply by about 1 "jiao." Order activity was quiet, with only slight arrivals. However, domestic merchants covered their far-term positions, causing prices to rise. Due to the current unfavorable weather conditions and concerns about wheat seedlings, factories refrained from selling, further fueling sellers' anxiety. Consequently, selling activity remained weak, and market covering was active. The closing price for the current month continued to rise by 1 "jiao," and new wheat for July-September was quoted at 2 "jiao." Fuxin and Fufeng processed 3,000 bags of spot wheat, with prices similar to the previous market. However, market sentiment remained bullish, and sellers intended to raise prices.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat April 8th, April 9th, Change</p>
<p>May: 95.375, 95.250, Down 0.25</p>
<p>July: 92.750, 92.500, Down 0.250</p>
<p>September: 92.500, 92.375, Down 0.125</p>
<p>Canadian Wheat April 8th, April 9th, Change</p>
<p>May: 87.500, 88.000, Up 0.50</p>
<p>July: 87.875, 88.375, Up 0.50</p>

<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, over thirty vessels arrived from various sources (totaling over 6,000 "shi"). Initially, sales in the local market were encouraging, and market conditions appeared promising. Prices for various types of rice continued to increase. However, the market then experienced a sudden slowdown in sales, with merchants selling only two to three hundred bags. Market sentiment shifted to a flat and weak tone. As a result, prices remained largely unchanged.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Due to the closure of the Yuji Pier, vessels had to detour. Now that transportation has resumed, vessel arrivals from various routes along the river were ample yesterday, with approximately forty vessels arriving. The sales volume of various types of rice was sluggish. Prices for medium-quality white rice fell by 1 "jiao," and prices for Fubao rice fell by a small amount. Prices for other types of rice showed a weakening trend.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Foreign Rice Prices Rise by 1.5 Jiao, Saigon Rice Newly Available for Sale <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market continued to be active and vibrant. Although there were many arrivals, prices from producing areas continued to rise, strengthening the resolve of merchants and speculators. Inland sales were the most concentrated, with activity also present in various ports along the Yangtze River. Local interest continued, further boosting the market. Prices rose by 1.5 jiao and 1 jiao respectively compared to the previous market. The entire market opened with over 20,000 bags of Saigon No. 13 rice, 4,000 bags of small broken rice, and approximately 2,000 bags of Siam and Annam rice combined. Additionally, over 2,000 tons of Saigon foreign! rice, previously purchased in advance, had not been sold due to weak local sales. Yesterday, 9,000 bags were finally sold to inland merchants, with prices opening at 6.85 yuan per raw "shi" and 3.8 yuan per 100 market "jin."</p>
<p>Recently, local merchants have actively sought Ke Xian rice. Sellers, encouraged by the sharp rise in production prices, intended to wait for higher prices before selling. However, due to the abundance of foreign rice, they dared not hold out. Yesterday, merchants from Nanjing and Jiujiang in the inland region continued to inquire and sold 2500 bags of Hunan Shamei rice, with prices continuing to rise by 1 jiao.</p>

<p>Yesterday's! market trend remained favorable. The Sugar Industry Cooperative sold a batch of Guangdong raw white sugar, totaling 3,000 bags of high-quality sugar, at a price of 17.6 yuan, an increase of 1 jiao compared to the (8th). Merchants were very eager to purchase, and the full amount was promptly distributed to the Public Association for trading. 24 rough white sugar was called at 17.7 yuan, and transit goods at 5.65 yuan, but no transactions were made. Taikoo Sugar B mark was also called up by 1 jiao to 18.1 yuan. Due to rising raw material costs, this factory's refined white sugar also followed suit, increasing by 1 jiao. Zhenyu No. 1 was priced at 17.1 yuan, No. 2 at 17 yuan, No. 3 at 16.85 yuan, and No. 4 at 16.7 yuan. Chaozhou continued to offer several hundred bags, with Tiqing priced at 10.9 yuan, Gao at 10.45 yuan, and lesser grades at 1-2 jiao less. Huilai Banqing at 9.7-8 yuan, and ordinary Longqing at 9.5 yuan.</p>

<p>Early reports indicated that the new sprouts of Xinghua Longan were promising in Putian, but very poor in Xianyou, only about 20% of normal. However, according to merchants from Xinghua yesterday, the flowering and sprouting of Putian Longan have also been poor recently.

However, this will not be realized in the short term.</p>

<p>Hard Lead Wire: Recently, demand from thermos bottle factories, spring factories, etc., has been very high, leading to a shortage in the market. Prices have risen by 3-4 jiao per "dan." For example, the price of No. 12 colored wire has increased from 7.75 yuan to over 8 yuan, and the prices of No. 13 and No. 20 range from 8.5 yuan to 9.2-3 yuan.</p>
<p>Pure Antimony: Yesterday, the estimated price suddenly increased by 40-50 yuan, with each ton estimated at 790 yuan. Transactions were made with the United States, Japan, and other countries. The reason for the price increase is reportedly due to rising prices in producing areas. The market opened with a total of 30-40 tons yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e233">Casually Thinking of Oblomov <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Leng Mo</p>
<p>I've always heard that Oblomov is written as a character worthy of ridicule, but when reading it, it's hard to see that the author intended to write Oblomov as a laughable figure. It seems to be the opposite; the author, through the mouth of Olga, praises him in the end as the purest and most virtuous person in the world, and this is said very earnestly. Certainly, Goncharov was a proponent of Westernization; he felt that the old Russian way of life could no longer be maintained. He sang the paean for Westernization and tolled the death knell for Oblomov. But death does not seem to be something to be mocked, and thus the author’s pen also does not flow with an air of mockery. The author seems very optimistic and is not worried that someone will continue to live the life of Oblomov. Originally, that kind of person could not be like Don Quixote, firmly embracing the vanished past. They disappeared without a trace along with the past, or perhaps because their disappearance was so bleak, it made one feel sad along with them, and their purity and goodness became something that could not be missed with sincerity.</p>
<p>If Oblomov had not encountered the decline of his family, if he had not only had some land left, but could still have been a major landowner, relying on a good steward on his estate, and had a peaceful life, he would have been the best of his kind. However, although he grew up in such an environment, he could not continue peacefully. He could only entrust his few properties to someone else to manage and throw himself into an unfamiliar society. The person he entrusted cheated him, and the first people he met also cheated him. His servants, like him, were ignorant of the world and encouraged him to maintain the old way of life. There is no doubt that such an environment could not encourage his advancement, so he, at most, only maintained his simplicity.</p>
<p>He met Olga too late, and Olga was also a simple person like him. She did not have the ability to transform his life. In love, it cannot be denied that Oblomov dominated her because she was deeply moved by his character and loved him. The Oblomov that the author wrote about in love is indeed extremely lovable. Perhaps this is why Chekhov ridiculed Goncharov as vulgar. The author is fully using the methods of writing an ideal romance. However, if we do not preconceive what Oblomov should be written as, then the role that Oblomov plays in the romance is not bad. He did not hide his weaknesses and force himself to be a hero. His weaknesses led to the failure of his love in the end. He was willing to simply think that this was the result of his own weakness, and he acknowledged that for Olga's happiness, he should be abandoned. In this way, all the weaknesses still completely filled his lovableness.</p>
<p>Given that he was loved by Olga and loved by the landlord, it is naturally not surprising. Because this is a relatively vulgar romance, the result is marriage, ordinarily until his death. This ending does not seem to change Oblomov's character, so in this respect, he is not particularly reprehensible. I am naturally not trying to forcefully say his advantages here and thus excuse his weariness. I only want to say that since Goncharov tried his best to write his advantages, then the impression he wanted to give us may not be entirely the same as what I have heard!</p>
<h3 id="e234">A First Glimpse of Wuchang <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Mo</p>
<p>Just as Wuchang was beginning to have good fortune replacing Nanchang, I ran to Wuchang, and after staying in a small inn for only a day or two, Wuchang gave me a "coup de grâce"—that is, stuffy heat.</p>
<p>I had long heard rumors about the intense heat of Wuhan. How there is not a single breeze after the sun sets, how the streets are full of half-naked poor people at night, how the rich cannot sleep all night and have to hire a rickshaw to run around the streets until dawn, dozing off in the rickshaw.</p>
<p>At this time, it was only mid-spring. When I came, the willows of Nanjing had not yet sprouted, but the willows here already had an inch of new green. During the day, the wind stops, and it is strangely muggy, as if it were early summer weather. Many pedestrians on the street have already changed into lined or single clothes. I walked on the street for a while wearing woolen clothes and felt a head full of sweat. Although I grew up in the South and have traveled through the hottest places in the world, because of this first taste of the dry heat, I had to be wary of the future summer life in Wuchang.</p>
<p>Wuchang and Hankou—the Chicago of the East—are indeed separated by only a river, but this shallow water is enough to leave Wuchang in the ranks of medieval cities in many ways. Like the old large cities in the South, the streets of Wuchang, except for a few roads, are all paved with white stones, but new-style cars have recently been running on the narrow and uneven stone roads. When the horns of the cars sound from afar, pedestrians quickly move aside and stand on the side of the road, paying "attention to salute" to the cars. Only after the cars pass do they move forward. Although there are a few new-style houses, the old-style houses dominate. The dirty white walls, the black and swollen large doors, and the dark blue and gold-splattered screens inside exude the darkness and decadence of the Middle Ages. There are also black decorations in the shape of dragons and arrows on the lintels, which may be a symbol of the height of the family. Except for a few shops facing the road, the shelves and counters in the shops are all arranged in the old style. It is dark and gloomy inside, and except for the foreign goods stores, it is quiet all day long. When the lights are lit, neon lights can be seen on one or two prosperous streets, but most of the city—especially the residential areas—is hidden in darkness and silence. Only some handicraft workshops are still working at night under kerosene lamps, and some small grocery stores half-cover the doors, revealing the pitiful light. Soon, the sound of the night watchman's bamboo clapper also begins, completing the gloomy and lonely medieval atmosphere.</p>
<p>The scenery of Wuchang is naturally not bad. Mount Luojia, East Lake, South Lake, and other places have not yet been visited, so I dare not make a light review now, but the ten miles of tender yellow rapeseed flowers in the suburbs and the winding elegance of Baobing Park are already worth admiring. However, the famous Yellow Crane Tower is a bit vulgar. Climbing the stone steps to the end of Snake Mountain, one looks up and sees a gray building like a church bell tower, but the plaque in front reads "Yellow Crane Tower Historic Site," which is really unexpected. A few steps further ahead is the Aolüe Tower, which does have some momentum, but the surroundings are full of photo studios and fortune-telling stalls, the latter being even more numerous. Photography is originally a brand new novelty, but when it comes to China, it is associated with the Duke of Zhou, King Wen, and the arts of Ma Yi and Liu. Now that Wuchang has become the center of Chinese politics, it is also the main battlefield for pursuing fame and fortune. The business of the philosophers at the Yellow Crane Tower must be booming. When I entered the Lüzu Temple, someone was performing a ritual. A young woman was kneeling in front of the statue of the god, closing her eyes, and holding a piece of yellow paper in both hands. A Taoist nun and several Taoist priests were chanting scriptures while holding ritual instruments. In the corner of the hall, there was a niche dedicated to the reclining Lüzu, depicting the story of the Yellow Millet Dream. Next to the niche was a doorway with a cloth curtain hanging down. On the wall were the words "Restricted Area for Staff Only." Lifting the curtain, it turned out to be a telegraph office. Modern transportation has invaded the territory ruled by divine power. What a comical contradiction!</p>
<p>However, regardless of whether it is contradictory or mysterious, Wuchang is indeed having good luck. Just look at the sudden increase in people seeking advice on legal matters on the streets, the jingling sound of rickshaws is particularly loud, the rental advertisements for houses are posted and torn off as soon as they are put up, and several new restaurants have opened, and you will know. Ah! Wuchang is on the road to prosperity. Why it is prospering and how other places are doing, these questions will be answered by others. Please excuse me from writing any further.</p>

<p>— Wei Zhongtian</p>
<p>Although I have had a better environment and a better mood to work hard and read some books in the past half year, I still feel that these days have been somewhat regrettable! When I wake up in the morning and see the sun shining in from the east window, it seems to flash by, and the day is over. When I see the sunset appearing from the west window, I watch the sunset hiding in the twilight with a feeling of regret, as if hope has disappeared so easily.</p>
<p>Although I have read quite a few books, I believe that if a person's knowledge comes entirely from books, it is limited. A young man who spends all day with a pen and a pile of books hiding in a room is not a happy thing. Knowledge should come from the lives of the broad masses, then it is rich and profound. What do you think, my friend?</p>
<p>In such good sunlight and good wind, I always feel that there is something more meaningful than reading waiting for me to do, waiting for me to experience, but I only hate that I lack that courage.</p>
<p>In the past, all hopes and all dreams were devoured by the demons of life. Today, the hope that has been reborn is very weak, as if feeling that I am too incompetent, too unpromising, and unworthy of doing anything. My great sorrow arises from this kind of self-reflection. Seeing others moving towards a great road day by day, while I am still standing on the line between darkness and light, how can I not be ashamed!</p>
<p>Watching spring go and then watching spring come again, spring is as good as ever, as young as ever, but my mood is getting older year by year. I am still young, but my heart is approaching old age. Thinking of this, I can't help but be startled. Where has the childlike innocence gone? Where has the enthusiasm of young people gone? It has turned into smoke and mist and been blown away by the great wind of life.</p>
<p>Since that surge of passion in my heart was taken away by autumn last year, I have been looking at the changes in everything in the world with a cold heart. How can I not want to rekindle this frozen emotion? However, life determines my will, so that I often think about it, but in the end I have to hide. One eye looks back at the old past, and the other eye looks far into the new future. In this situation, who can resist contradictions not lording over their heart? Who will not be led into a dark little room by contradictions?</p>
<p>Every spring, I inevitably feel a little homesick, and this year it seems to be even stronger. I haven't been back to my hometown for eight whole years. According to Chun Di's letter, my hometown is much thinner and calmer than it was eight years ago. In every alley, there are thin, long black hands reaching out to beg from passers-by. Strong young people have all flowed to the cities. Although my hometown is heading towards the line of death, there are still many things in my hometown that make me miss it. The longer I don't go home, the more I miss it. I think this is probably not just me.</p>
<p>In the spring of my hometown, the small mountain in front of my door is full of purple wildflowers. When I was a child, I would always pick ten or a hundred of them and put them in front of my bed, on my grandmother's lapel, and on myself. When they withered, I would go pick them again tomorrow. Anyway, spring doesn't leave, and the flowers can't be picked completely. Now, there are also purple flowers on the vase on my desk, but I don't have the childhood mood to put flowers on my lapel.</p>
<h3 id="e237">On "Scholars Despising Each Other" (3) <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>In the late Qing Dynasty, someone in Shanghai compiled a collection of essays by modern scholars into fifty volumes, and included Zhang Taiyan, Tan Fusheng, and Huang Gongdu. Zhang Taiyan wrote to Deng Shi, saying: "Tan and Huang are worthy of respect in terms of their aspirations and actions. However, their scholarship is sparse, and their writing lacks scrutiny. Although I am simple and crude, I dare not compare myself with them. Wang Renqiu, a modern scholar, can be said to have wandered in their field, but he still imitates their reputation and cannot go his own way; Kang Changsu often has good words, but they are somewhat cunning and unrestrained; I also do not want to be listed with these two worthies, and suggest that my humble essays be deleted to avoid being mixed in with them!" At that time, Liang Qichao's political essays were all the rage, and everyone was influenced by him, but Zhang Taiyan ridiculed him, saying: "Such as one or two elders, they are all talented in rhetoric and social interaction. They are scholars who seek fame and gain, and their writing is like blowing life into withered bones, not what is meant by being refined and substantial. Therefore, it is said: 'To make nothing into something, to make emptiness into fullness, to make simplicity into extravagance, it is difficult to be constant!'" Zhang Taiyan also looked down on Lin Shu and Yan Fu's translations, saying: "What the lower classes admire is Yan Fu and Lin Shu's kind! Although Fu's writing is meticulous, its style is like that of the imperial examination, as if it is pretending. Shu is even worse than Fu, his writing lacks selection, and his essence is mixed with impurities, and it is even infiltrated by the style of Tang Dynasty novels! He wants to imitate its style, but it is like dust covering it, like a decayed tooth smiling, like a curved shoulder walking, thinking it is beautiful, but only adding to its ugliness!" In this way, on the one hand, it is necessary to meet the needs of the times (Qichao said of himself: "At this time, I liberated myself and strived to be simple and clear, sometimes mixing in slang, rhymes, and foreign grammar, and I did not restrain myself in my writing. Scholars competed to imitate it, calling it the new literary style, while the elders hated it and ridiculed it as a wild fox; however, its writing was clear and methodical, and its writing often carried emotion, which had a kind of magic for readers."), on the other hand, it is necessary to have solid scholarship (Taiyan said of himself: "Those who imitate the arguments of the Tang and Song dynasties benefit from their eloquence, and those who imitate the arguments of the Han dynasty benefit from their memorization, which is enough: those who imitate the arguments of the Wei and Jin dynasties, do not merely adhere to the text above, and cannot defend themselves with words below, they must first prepare with learning."), and will never show mercy, expressing it in words and expressions.</p>
<p>Judging from this, truly, the literary world is like a battlefield. Since ancient times, there has never been a "peaceful" atmosphere. However, it is not a bad phenomenon in the literary world to set up formations from different standpoints and fight for three hundred rounds before sounding the gongs to withdraw the troops. Literature, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, has progressed in this way. When Hugo's "Ernani" was staged at the Théâtre Français on the night of February 15, 1830, those classical writers sat upstairs and elsewhere, intending to obstruct the performance; on the other hand, romantic writers and young people who sympathized with them gathered in the main hall downstairs, preparing for the disturbance of the classical school. For a time, the theater seemed to have become a battlefield: but after this fierce struggle, Romanticism stepped into the French literary world. Looking at the events before us, the heated debate between the "Xinmin Congbao" and the "Min Bao" opened up a great situation since the Xinhai Revolution; the New Youth's charge launched the great tide of the May Fourth Movement; during the period of cultural advancement, great conflicts in the literary world were probably inevitable. If "scholars despising each other" is really like what "my family's" Zihuan said, "each despises what the other excels at, with what they excel at," and is only a kind of "criticism," not a "personal attack," I think it should exist and will inevitably exist. Su Zizhan wrote to Emperor Shenzong: "Gentlemen are harmonious but not the same, while petty people are the same but not harmonious; harmony is like harmonious soup, while sameness is like Jishui. Therefore, Sun Bao said: Zhou Gong was a great sage, and Zhao Gong was a great worthy, but they still did not like each other, which is recorded in the classics, and neither was harmed. Wang Dao of Jin can be said to be a founding minister. Every time he spoke to guests, everyone present praised him, but Wang Shu was not happy, thinking that people were not Yao and Shun, so how could everything be perfect; Dao also restrained himself and thanked him." Do we hope that today's literary world will become a place where everyone breathes through the same nostril and lives a life of nodding and agreeing?</p>
<p>Therefore, I am not against "scholars despising each other"; I hope that the Chinese literary world can cultivate a healthy and powerful atmosphere of criticism! (End)</p>

<p>A piece of news said: The new order issued by the Education Bureau requires all private school teachers to take exams. The exam questions are very difficult, and they also require testing on the Three Principles of the People. Those who fail are not allowed to teach. In fact, this is a way to clean up private schools. The list of several local private school teachers has been fully opened and reported by the district primary schools.</p>
<p>Another piece of news said: The district office sent an official letter to the Public Security Bureau, saying that private schools were forcibly pulling students from schools, deliberately destroying education, disrupting public security, and delaying learning. Police will be sent immediately to seal them off...</p>
<p>In addition, there are many almost absurd horror stories that fly over every day like they have wings. Although Mr. Juqing has some doubts about them, he dares not disbelieve them. Even the most absurd news that he knows is a rumor, he dares not definitely deny it. He is worried all day long and completely bewildered by this rumor.</p>
<p>He has no time to take care of the problem of rectifying the academic style anymore.</p>
<p>For six or seven days in a row, Mr. Juqing was surrounded by a kind of bewilderment and fear.</p>
<p>The reality may not be as severe as the rumors, but the district primary schools will definitely not give up easily, he understands this. Think of a way to deal with it, but he doesn't have one—what power does he have to confront the school? It would be a good strategy to contact all the private school teachers in the town and cooperate to deal with it, and Mr. Juqing also thought of it; but his stubborn nature made him hesitate: to get involved with those disreputable teachers? Although Mr. Juqing's current situation is a bit downcast, he still has a body of pride!</p>

<h3 id="e239">US President's Power Does Not Extend to the Sea <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Xiaomin</p>
<p>A dispatch from the National News Agency in Miami yesterday stated that President Roosevelt spent a day fishing on a yacht yesterday without catching a single fish. Today, he went to Consforden Island. An aide smiled and told the President that the President's power does not seem to extend to the sea. The aide's words are extremely funny and humorous. If power cannot reach the sea, let alone the two oceans.</p>
<p>The traditional policy of the United States is to manipulate world hegemony, but once the situation becomes urgent and uncontrollable, it immediately turns around and strictly adheres to neutrality, fearing involvement in the vortex of war. This is indeed a fishing trick of the Americans. Now that war clouds are permeating Europe and Asia, the United States has once again issued a special alert, fearing involvement in the vortex. From this point of view, the saying that the President's power does not extend to the sea is quite worthy of consideration.</p>
<p>In the past, novels said that Jiang Taigong met King Wen at the age of eighty. One day, Jiang Ziya was fishing on the bank of the Wei River. King Wen happened to pass by and ordered his attendants to ask him questions. Ziya said, "Big fish don't come, let small fish go." King Wen knew that this person must have a background, so he went to visit him in person. Their conversation was congenial, and he was overjoyed and said, "I have been looking forward to Taigong for a long time." Then he carried him back. Such a big fish was easily caught by Taigong.</p>
<p>It is also said that King Wen also liked to fish, but his fishing hook was not curved, but straight. His intention was that those who were willing would take the bait, and those who were unwilling would not be forced. I ask, which fish would be willing to be hooked? This kind of hypocritical means of selling benevolence and seeking fame naturally had another purpose. This kind of fishing method was to win the hearts of the people.</p>
<p>Now, the President of the United States has been fishing and fishing, fishing for a whole day, but has not caught a single fish. It seems that in the current trend, the United States' manipulative policies have not yet found a suitable opportunity.</p>
<h3 id="e240">Afu Restaurant <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>When the ship arrived at the pier, a sign hanging under the eaves of the police亭子"Afu Restaurant" caught my attention. Because there was no hotel in the small town, and the ship arrived at the pier at dusk, people going to Xicun had to travel at night, so the police station was set up like that. Following the crowd onto the pier, a short, stout fellow with a round face jumped out of Afu Restaurant and stopped everyone to his shop. - I hadn't been home for several years, and everything in my hometown felt unfamiliar to me; I混进the restaurant inexplicably. The formerly small bedroom now had three tables placed in it, and ten or so people sat full like bees, and the stout fellow busied himself pouring tea and handing out towels; asking each guest what dishes they wanted to eat.</p>
<p>I sat in the corner as if in a dream. Although this was my hometown, everything was a strange sight after the ship arrived at the pier. Because I was not used to traveling by boat, it seemed like something was surging up in my stomach. When the stout fellow asked me what dishes I wanted to eat, I was stunned. - It wasn't that I couldn't think of the name of a dish, or that I simply didn't want to eat; wasn't this shop owner the policeman who used to wear a black uniform? He had been to Xicun because of a robbery on the road; that short stature, round face, the flesh on his cheeks piled his eyes into a line, a Maitreya Buddha-like forever smiling face!</p>
<p>"Are you going to Xicun, sir?"</p>
<p>I wanted to answer him that I was the son of Lu Xiangshin from Xicun, but did I look like someone from the village? Everyone who landed from this pier was from Xicun, and you could tell by listening to their Xitou accent. I couldn't speak the language of my hometown, and I was wearing an awkward outfit, so Afu, who was now a restaurant owner, or he looked at me with the eyes of a policeman.</p>
<p>"Are you called Afu?"</p>
<p>"Yes. What dishes would you like to eat, sir?"</p>
<p>"Why is this police station closed?"</p>
<p>"Are you from Xicun, sir?" Afu was surprised, and even those fellow villagers I didn't recognize gave me strange looks. "It's been closed for a long time. - Since Lu Xiangshin passed away, Xicun seems to have no master. No one is willing to掏腰包for the轮派police donation. Mrs. Lu paid for several months alone... The young master has been out for so long, and there is no news of 一佃. In this day and age, doing good deeds doesn't have a good ending!"</p>
<p>The people eating all started talking at once. My face turned red, and I couldn't say a word for a long time. I had been drifting outside alone for more than ten years, and my hometown had become like this: my father had died without me knowing, and my mother was probably looking forward to her son's return day and night?</p>
<p>"How is Mrs. Lu doing now?"</p>
<p>"Do you know her family, sir? Are you going to Xicun now?"</p>
<p>"Yes. - I am her son!"</p>
<p>Everyone gathered around, looking at me, and the restaurant was silent for a moment, as if the air was too tight for them to open their mouths. But I knew that this was an expression of their excessive affection, they were glad that the father of the good man had not died out!</p>
<p>But what could I do to repay their deep affection? I had been away for more than ten years, and my mother was living in difficulty. Could my own battle-scarred heart be thrown into a warm embrace again?</p>
<p>I looked迷惘ly at the dim kerosene lamp, and everything in front of me gradually blurred, and finally I could no longer see this unfamiliar hometown!</p>
<h3 id="e241">The Third Wife of the Eldest Son <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>Speaking of the Third Wife of the Eldest Son, her height is not taller than anyone else, but people偏生 call her the Third Wife of the Eldest Son. If, according to most people's opinions, say that she is shrinking now, that sentence can't be fully trusted; because when I was seven or eight years old, she was still a very robust middle-aged woman, at that time she didn't look much taller than she is now. If the "Eldest Son" refers to her husband - the Eldest Son's Grandfather - then maybe there's still some reason. However, the Eldest Son's Grandfather had already passed away when I was born, so how long he was, I never saw him.</p>
<p>It is said that the Third Wife of the Eldest Son died her husband when she was twenty-six years old, and although she has been a young widow until now, she is in her sixties, but she is very healthy. I have never heard her have a severe illness from childhood to now. A head of hair that is as black and shiny as oil, and a mouth full of snow-white and neat teeth, makes people doubt that she is only forty or fifty years old!</p>
<p>She doesn't have a biological son or daughter, but she inherited a nephew from the second room; but she never takes care of their affairs, only cooks and eats for herself. Usually, she always sits at home chanting Buddha or sticking ingots, and then goes to sell the ingots to every household in the village, earning some money to subsidize her expenses. When she is free, she might go for a walk in the few pieces of mountain land she proposed, looking at the flowers, fruits, and trees.</p>
<p>The Third Wife of the Eldest Son is 清潔 in love, and her relationship with people is also strangely good. No one in the village before or after will have a grudge against her. What she hates most is being a "Buddha's head" and sitting up at night, so she has never been a "Buddha's head" in her life, or sat up at night in a temple. She doesn't object to burning incense, but she doesn't want to go to Hangzhou and Putuo. She always burns incense in nearby places, and sometimes burns incense in the atrium of her own home, and counts it as done after kowtowing a few times. She said: "A thousand Buddhas and ten thousand Buddhas are just one Buddha. Burning incense doesn't matter whether it's far or near, just be sincere. Why rush to borrow the Buddha's name to游山玩景 after traveling a thousand and eight hundred miles?"</p>
<p>Her adopted daughter-in-law and she don't get along very well. This差儿 is of course her daughter-in-law's fault; being gluttonous and lazy doesn't count, doesn't she also secretly come to偸 her things, and even结掇the勇人得妈 has not heard a sound from his mouth for a long time. But she doesn't bother to argue about these things; because she understands that they inherited from her, but 看相 her share of the inheritance, and are not biological flesh and blood. She thinks: anyway, the inheritance will always be given to them sooner or later, so I决不好take it to the coffin with me, now it's better to be泰气and do a favor to others, and save myself a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>Recently, on the two beams of the main hall of her house, there is already a small plaque with the words "Pine and Cypress are Equally Chaste" in vermilion paint; that plaque was given to her by several绅董s of the entire district, and it is said that they also advanced a birth position for her in the 石公山节烈祠, this is considered a "glorious harvest" in exchange for her youth and happiness for her entire life!</p>
<h3 id="e242">Scattered Notes on Returning South <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Tianqi</p>
<p>The hearts of people returning home are probably very anxious. On the night I arrived in Songshi, I heard that the county-Song Highway had been opened to traffic, and that there was a bus at seven o'clock in the morning, which was a pleasant surprise. If I were to travel as usual, the water journey from Songshi to the county seat would take at least two full days to complete; now it can be shortened to within three hours, which is such a light and easy thing. Although it will cost a little more fare, I feel it is worth it.</p>
<p>The sky was not yet碧白 when the servant came to call at the door, saying that there were few buses and many people, so we had to go to the station two hours early. So, I hastily finished breakfast and set off immediately. Songshi was originally a small market town, and after walking through a small street and turning into an alley, you were in the countryside. At this time, the dim night shadows笼网d the earth, and the mountain shadows around were looming; the Venus was dragging its residual light high on the peak of 玉指. Walking past people's doors, I provoked a burst of dog barking. Now that I was close to home, hearing this亲切 dog barking, I couldn't help but feel an inexplicable comfort in my heart.</p>
<p>When I arrived at the station, it was indeed crowded with a团人. There were still two hours before the bus departure time, so I had to stand aside and wait patiently. But while seeing this situation, I couldn't help but hesitate, there were only two buses. There were so many people, and if I couldn't squeeze onto the bus, it would be too late to transfer to a墟boat, and I would have to stay in Songshi for another night, which would be terrible.</p>
<p>Finally, after struggling until dawn, the buses slowly drove out of the garage. The situation at this time was indescribably chaotic, to say the least. The front was already overcrowded, and the back was desperately surging forward; I was caught in the middle, and there was simply no room to maneuver. Fortunately, the shop servant desperately rushed forward, climbed in through the bus window, and grabbed a seat.</p>
<p>At this time, I had just calmed down, and the bus was also preparing to depart. At this moment, two soldiers with刺刀s inserted on their guns suddenly came over, aggressively slapped the front of the bus:</p>
<p>—Cannot depart!</p>
<p>The power of this "cannot depart" was like a bolt from the blue, shocking the passengers in the bus to look at each other in silence. Although I am a sojourner returning from another place, seeing this situation, I can understand eight or nine points of what is going on. But the driver unexpectedly raised a protest:</p>
<p>—Your company did not notify us in advance</p>
<p>—丢那妈! What if there was no notification? I'll watch you drive!</p>
<p>—We are doing things according to reason...</p>
<p>With a snap, a slap had already been pasted on the driver's mouth? Another soldier grabbed the driver's arm and pulled him out, and he had already fallen on the road with his feet in the air.</p>
<p>—丢那妈! Watch me shoot you, you bandit!</p>
<p>The soldier held the gun over and made a gesture of firing, but at this time the passengers shouted out involuntarily:</p>
<p>—Cannot!</p>
<p>—Cannot!</p>
<p>After a brief commotion, the soldier's gun didn't fire, but the bus still couldn't depart, and the driver, whose face was as swollen as a pumpkin from being hit, was also taken to the company.</p>
<p>The next day, I finally gave up on the idea of taking the bus and endured two days of困闷 water journey before arriving at the county seat.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Night Escape <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Yonghui</p>
<p>Thirty people in a team—and I was one of them—trying our best to make our footsteps as quiet as possible; not even our breathing was allowed to be heavy. This wasn't because we were paranoid or suspicious; it was real: if we didn't do this, we would immediately fall into the enemy's tight encirclement! We would become prisoners! We would be beheaded! We knew: the enemy was extremely cruel to us.</p>
<p>A moon like the light of a sesame oil lamp shone out from the dark gray clouds; on the yellow dirt road without reeds, the lines of the road could still be faintly distinguished: but we couldn't take the relatively smooth main road, we had to walk on the small road full of reeds. In order to avoid unexpected dangers, our palms were almost becoming feet crawling on the ground.</p>
<p>The small road was bumpy and full of potholes, and sharp stones that pierced the soles of our shoes were scattered all over it, and even more, gusts of numbness shot up our legs! We felt cold on our bodies, and our feet became even more slippery. We walked from 7 PM to 1 AM after midnight. I think we walked at most fifteen li (7.5 km): but both feet</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>were twisted and sore.</p>
<p>The reed path was finally finished at 2 AM. Immediately following the end of the reed path, what unfolded before us was a fairly wide river; the silvery-white river water, under the dim moonlight, in the still night, was exceptionally beautiful and poetic; however, we didn't have the leisure to appreciate these things in this still and dangerous situation. My ears were occupied by the high-speed trembling of everyone's heart. Bending our waists to ninety degrees, we ran as nimbly as monkeys at the edge of the shallow grass: we had approached an extremely dangerous, life-or-death situation! Whether we could continue to live depended on whether we could cross this river tonight! Because according to the reports from the scouts: the enemy had already stationed themselves in the small village on the other side of the river.</p>
<p>A pontoon bridge approached us in a flurry of urgent running! Our hands all gripped our guns, ready to engage in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy if necessary! A bloody battle!</p>
<p>"Password!" A voice came from the dense forest on the other side of the river. I believe the hearts of all thirty of us jumped into our throats.</p>
<p>We rushed forward without a word! Trying to find a way out of the dead end! "Password!" The second voice was even more urgent!</p>
<p>"Password!" The third time it was issued, still without a response, the sentry fired a shot with a "bang."</p>
<p>Our volley of shots fired over, and the sentry's gunshot was silent. We rushed over like madmen!</p>
<p>But in the faint moonlight, the body of the sentry lying across the path was actually one of our own people. This could be seen from the markings on the clothes, even in the dim moonlight.</p>
<p>A chaotic sound of footsteps poured out from the foot of the mountain on the opposite side. We knew: they were probably coming to help after hearing the sentry's gunshot and our volley. To avoid misunderstanding, we shouted the secret signal to them loudly.</p>

<p>The sky is pale, the clouds are clear, and the breeze is refreshing. A few lines of new geese pass through the sky. The busy waiter Gao Lishi is in the imperial garden, sweeping and tidying up. The autumn scenery in the inner garden is boundless. Everywhere there are ponds with water chestnuts and lotuses. After a short while, it is reported that Emperor Ming has arrived. Consort Yang, favored by him, is supported on either side. Countless osmanthus flowers are fragrant. Sometimes parrots call to each other. The imperial banquet is laid out on the flower pavilion. The table is full of delicacies from the sea and mountains. Consort Yang held a golden pot in her jade hands, the Emperor tapped the clapper, the Consort sang a song, and the dance of the Rainbow Skirt and Feather Coat was unparalleled in the world. Taizhen knelt down and offered three cups of wine. The Emperor happily helped her up. Consort Yang fell drunk on the Consort Yang couch. A picture of a begonia in spring sleep. Seeing the drunken bear, his appearance was bewitched. Who knew that the joy was not over, and the sorrow had already arrived. It was said that An Lushan had rebelled and returned to war. Approaching the capital, what could be done? The Tang dynasty had been at peace for a long time. The civil and military officials were unable to resist the enemy. Quickly order the six armies to protect the Emperor. The carriages and horses hurriedly traveled a long journey. Temporarily avoiding the smoke of war, they were fortunate enough to go to Shu. The poor weak woman, like a flower, shattered into jade and disappeared into a piece of silk. She was given death at Maweipo in a short time.</p>

<p>From ancient times, the methods relied upon by sages to prevent disputes for ten thousand generations have all been destroyed. Later kings began to realize that humans can overcome heaven, and that it is possible to seize the heirship; that the young can bully the old; the disasters of usurpation are frequently seen in historical records. Those who brought China into the realm of barbarians were perhaps initiated by Jin and Zhou. Alas, to be noble beyond compare, to be rich beyond compare, the number of those who covet and desire it is numerous. If a brave person guards it with his heart, it will be taken away by someone twice as brave. If a wise person guards it, it will be taken away by someone even wiser. Guarding with oaths, they will sometimes be broken; guarding with laws, they will sometimes be abolished; guarding with city walls, they will sometimes be destroyed; guarding with armor and weapons, they will sometimes be defeated. Only by guarding it with heaven will people dare not compete with it. This is what those who possess the state rely on: that the fixed distinction between嫡庶 legitimate and illegitimate sons, eldest and youngest, comes from heaven. To disrupt the fixed distinction of heaven without reason is to destroy one's own reliance. Alas, how dangerous!</p>

<p>The Midnight Music Society at No. 4, Luban Road, Popubangfang, spares no effort in promoting national music. Because the society's original venue was insufficient, it moved to its new venue at No. 66, Min Village, Mintini Yin Road, in the French Concession, starting on the 5th of this month, and is operating as usual. The interior has been greatly renovated, and efforts are being made to expand publicity and recruit more members, in order to revive ancient music. Recently, Mr. Xu Ruhui, the organizer of the society, plans to compose a "New Eighteen Songs of the Tartar Reed Flute." This piece is a grand ensemble piece for sixty-four people. He is currently working on the composition and planning the instruments. In addition to the basic members, more members will be recruited. Those who have a basic understanding of national music but no special hobbies are welcome to join. A large number of ancient musical instruments are being rushed to be made, and new music will soon appear in society.</p>

<h3 id="e248">The Production of Mickey Mouse Cartoons at the Walt Disney Studios <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>The Mickey Mouse cartoons that we see on the screen last for ten minutes, but in the studio, it takes eight weeks to make them.</p>
<p>The first step in producing a Mickey Mouse cartoon is to decide on the story. Usually—but not always—Walt Disney comes up with the idea, preparing what kind of adventure Mickey Mouse will have in the new film. After the idea is there, a meeting is held with 25 or 30 employees of the Walt Disney Studios to decide on the story. After the outline of the story is planned, the humorist, Mike, gets to work deciding how Mickey Mouse should move in each scene of the story, and trying to insert as much funny and humorous material as possible.</p>
<p>The second step is a troublesome painting process. Humorous scenes and important dialogues must be drawn one by one.</p>
<p>An ordinary short film requires 9,000 to 10,000 paintings to be photographed, and each painting is done by hand. Each one is photographed on film, so you can imagine how heavy the workload is.</p>
<p>Walt Disney believes that sound should not only be added, but also be in sync with Mickey Mouse's movements. The movement of each step should be in harmony with each musical note. Therefore, in addition to painting, the second important task is composing the music. This work is done after the story is written, but before the painting begins. We can imagine that if the music is in eleven beats, then Mickey Mouse should take eleven steps on the screen. So, the music must be composed first, and then the painting can begin.</p>
<p>There is a design leader, like a director in an ordinary film company, who carefully directs the work of each artist based on the music and the anecdotes in the story, from the time Mickey Mouse enters the scene to the time he leaves the scene, how he should move.</p>
<p>This leader makes each segment of the film in harmony with the music. Generally, he has to edit 9,000 paintings, and each painting has to be drawn by the artist.</p>
<p>The film is transferred to film, and what about the background? Sometimes one hundred or more paintings are almost the same. So, these films do not need to be painted every time, they just need to be re-photographed. After the film is painted and the photography is completed, the second step is to add sound.</p>
<p>In a sound mixing room, the sound is recorded. There is a small orchestra sitting in the corner, and across from them is a glass room. The orchestra starts in this glass room under the direction of the conductor to test it once.</p>
<p>Inside the sound mixing room, there is a long table, almost as long as the room, and it is full of equipment. Four or five people are standing in front of the table, and there is a radio. In front of the orchestra, there are several smaller radios. These people are all music experts, and they can make each note play with unexpected excitement.</p>
<p>When the Mickey Mouse cartoon is finished in the Walt Disney Studios, the pictures are photographed on one film, and the sound is on another. Then they are put together. This work is relatively simple, and every film company can do it. After everything is finished, it is decided how many copies to print.</p>
<p>Humorous cartoons were not invented by Walt Disney. In 1928, when the sudden invention of talking films with sound and dialogue almost caused the entire film industry to collapse, cartoons were already not new things.</p>
<p>In the early part of 1928, Walt Disney imagined using a mouse as the main character in the film. At first, he named the mouse Mortimer Mouse, but later changed it to Mickey, entirely for the sake of brevity. Rabbits and other animals on cards had already met us. Mickey Mouse's appearance on the screen was just expanding a family of animals.</p>
<p>In the spring of the same year, Walt Disney had another idea, deciding to add music to Mickey Mouse's movements. The result was a success, and this was a new invention.</p>
<p>Walt Disney initially sold his films to several large film companies, until he later met someone in New York who gave him economic assistance to become independent. When his film was publicly screened in a small theater in mid-September, it received great praise from the New York audience, and from then on, Mickey Mouse cartoons occupied an important position.</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3 id="e249">Review of "Border Town" <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Fei</p>
<p>Border Town—Grand Light</p>
<p>Paul Muni, who achieved extremely high acting achievements in works such as "The Story of Louis Pasteur" and "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang", but was not very commendable in "The Good Earth", has given people a deep impression and a good feeling. Therefore, this "Border Town" has also aroused great attention from the audience. In the current era of the star-centered system, people often take the leading actor as the goal to speculate on the quality of a certain film. On the one hand, because the actors give the audience the most direct attention, and on the other hand, the name of the leading actor is sometimes written larger than the title of the film on the film's billboard.</p>
<p>However, deciding the quality of a film based on the actor is by no means reasonable. It is true that film is a comprehensive art, and the acting skills of the stars occupy one of the important parts of the film's composition, but when the director and screenwriter, especially the script, cannot lay the foundation for the success of the work, even a genius actor can only be powerless. Paul Muni's failure in "The Good Earth" is a clear example. Which actor can achieve great success in a mediocre script? Therefore, regarding the evaluation of "Border Town", we cannot only base it on the acting skills of the leading actor, but rather the review of the content of the play is our most important task.</p>
<p>Looking at the story of this film, the playwright has a strong sense of justice, and his considerable degree of anger at the current society is very clearly expressed. In the male protagonist who was born humble, he expresses his dissatisfaction with society. He demands justice from society, no, he has even greater aspirations to demand justice from society on behalf of his group. Therefore, after graduating from a simple higher law school after five years, he immediately hung up his lawyer's sign with the money his mother exchanged for her ring. He was full of Lincoln's spirit to protect the human rights of the poor. However, the first time he practiced, he deeply believed that his ideals had failed (A rich woman drove her car and injured a poor old man, and as a result, she only paid a compensation fee of twenty-five yuan. He was also disqualified from being a lawyer.) He asserted. There is no justice or fairness in the current society, only money and power can become the victors. Up to this point, the playwright's anger is fully expressed. But where is the theme of the play? The playwright cannot instruct this young man with a sense of justice to engage in practical and effective struggles, but rather the individualism of trying to gain money and power in order to take revenge on society. We do not deny the existence of this kind of character. Young people with a sense of justice, if they cannot take the path of collectivism, then there is only individualistic revenge. However, when they are tempered again in the cruel reality, when their last hope is also disillusioned, they will inevitably realize it and turn from the wrong path of individualism to a positive path. However, the playwright is confused by the old worldview, and his understanding of reality cannot be observed correctly; when the male protagonist in his pen understands the existence of class after gaining money (he proposed to a rich woman, but the woman refused his request due to the disparity in class), he passively converted to the belief in God. This fully expresses the playwright's cowardice from active to passive, and at the same time serves as educational significance. And it gives the audience an impression.</p>
<p>Here, the merits and demerits of this film have already been judged. All that can be said is about technical aspects. From Paul Muni's makeup (in order to dress up as a Mexican, he painted his face brown, while also highlighting the whiteness and power of his eyes), you can tell that he is very talented and very serious. He vividly expresses the steadfast and intelligent personality of the young man with a sense of justice that we can often see. However, the script makes it so that he has no major scenes to do, and as a result, he only gives people a level of devotion to the point of perfection. On the other hand, in terms of the female lead, the screenwriter and director have strengthened her inner description. When she killed her husband and could not get the love of her lover, which caused a terrifying change, Bette Davis's performance was quite successful. (However, the tense parts were probably reshot several times, so it jumped very violently.) This is where the director's delicate technique is expressed, and the success of this psychological description should be the most important technical achievement of this film.</p>
<h3 id="e250">Commentary on "Cops Are Afraid of Their Wives" <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Lun</p>
<p>“It’s　a　Cop”—Screening in Greater Shanghai</p>
<p>First, it must be said that the translated title "Cops Are Afraid of Their Wives" is too "business-minded" and somewhat unsuitable for the entire content of the play. This is because although the cop, the protagonist depicted in the play, is somewhat afraid of his wife, the playwright mainly wants to use the unfortunate experience of a relatively good cop to deliver a sermon that goes something like, "Good kids, work hard with all your might, it doesn't matter if you suffer a little hardship in body and mind, you can get promoted and make a fortune by relying on this." However, at the same time, for the sake of business, the author had to painstakingly cater to the audience with extremely low-level tastes. As a result, amidst the ridiculous gimmicks, the audience's burst of laughter drowned out the author's original intent of the sermon. On the contrary, the scene of the cop's promotion after enduring many foolish hardships also became a laughable ending.</p>
<p>The plot unfolds as the cop, Shi Bolai, is ordered to monitor a group of bandits who are stealing important secret formulas from a certain factory. Instead, he is seduced by the female bandit, Bao Baidi, and lets the bandits go. As a result, he is dismissed from the police force and falls into a pitiful and ridiculous situation of being scolded by his wife. Later, due to a coincidental coincidence, he tracks down the group of bandits again, and is once again seduced, leading to all sorts of ridiculous and embarrassing events. In the end, another coincidence occurs, finally enabling this cop, who has suffered greatly, to solve the case and achieve fame and fortune.</p>
<p>Such an empty story, coupled with several accidental coincidences and other shortcomings in the script, naturally feels unremarkable. However, due to the awkward face, exaggerated mannerisms, and ridiculous encounters of the lead actor, Xue Ni Huawade, the audience can indeed derive a lot of amusement.</p>
<p>The director, Maclean Rogers, has many clever touches. Hoder's performance is consistently exaggerated from beginning to end, with a sneaky and muddled tone, and a sense of affectation in everything from pronunciation to action. Naturally, this is a common problem in this type of film and for this type of character, but comparatively speaking, Howard has been quite successful here.</p>
<p>The entire play places excessive emphasis on the role of the cop played by Howard, and as a result, the entire play's mood and tone develop abnormally. In terms of acting skills, apart from the skating techniques in the two skating scenes being quite impressive, there is not much room for the supporting actors to show their skills.</p>

<p>— Tong Yun</p>
<p>Pengniside grabbed Zhuliya's collar and said, "You're crazy." Zhuliya said, "That's right, I'm crazy. It's all your fault." She fiercely beat Pengniside, shouting, "Let go! I'm going to reason with Xuelun. After I tell her about our relationship, let's see if she still wants you!" Pengniside held her back, and his anger became uncontrollable when he heard her words. He said, "You want to tell her?" Zhuliya was still struggling hard. Pengniside grabbed her throat with both hands. Zhuliya initially widened her eyes and struggled for a while, but soon lowered her head and stopped moving.</p>
<p>Pengniside laid Zhuliya on the ground, muttering curses, "You still want to tell her, huh!" Soon, he walked into the house with many pieces of wood in his hand. He saw Xuelun was on the phone. She held the phone and said, "Mr. Bolang Que? This is Xuelun Na Ge Tuo. I'm telling you, I can't do it anymore. I really don't have time to write that Riverside Association news. It's best if you write it yourself."</p>
<p>After she finished speaking, she hung up the phone and said to Pengniside. "Let's go. Let's go out for a walk. I'm hungry. Let's find a food cart and eat some pig intestines." Pengniside was not in the mood to keep her, so he accompanied her outside and got into his car. Pengniside accelerated and drove straight ahead. Xuelun was in the car, and for a moment she thought of Jiemu Bolang Que, wishing he could hear Pengniside's declarations of love to her, so he would know that she wasn't some excellent melon, and that she truly loved him from head to toe. As she was deep in thought, she suddenly saw a food cart parked by the side of the road and called for Pengniside to brake. She said, "We can eat some ham and eggs."</p>
<p>Pengniside didn't want to stop at first, but because Xuelun insisted, he had to stop. As they were eating ham and eggs at the food cart, the cart was equipped with a wireless radio. The radio constantly broadcasted calls from the police station. At this time, the radio suddenly shouted, "Police car number forty-seven…go to one thousand and one Sipailusi Street…domestic dispute…" Then it shouted again, "All police cars…rush to number sixty-two Aiwen Niu Road…rush…rush…"</p>
<p>Pengniside's heart was pounding, and he didn't know if his own case had been discovered, or if the radio would also shout it out. After Xuelun finished eating the ham and eggs, he quickly threw the money on the counter and pulled Xuelun away. Xuelun asked strangely. "What's wrong? What's your hurry?"</p>
<p>Early the next morning, Jiemu Bolang Que ran to Na Ge Tuo's house. He told Xuelun that Zhuliya Bode Sen had been murdered, and he wanted her to find a way to take him to the Bode Sen's house. He said, "This case is very bizarre, and it happened after the first night of the Riverside Association last night. There are many rumors circulating outside, and I don't know whose name will be implicated, so much so that it will be published in the newspaper. If I am at the Bode Sen's house, I can try to prevent them from involving your name."</p>
<p>When Xuelun heard his words, she thought they made sense, so she agreed to him, and tried her best to pretend to be indifferent and thanked him. Soon, they had arrived at the Bode Sen's house. In the hallway, they heard plainclothes detectives questioning the Bode Sen's servants. The servants all said that their master seemed to be in a bad mood when he returned from the Riverside Association last night because he had drunk some wine. One of the maids also said that the master and mistress had argued the night before. Pengniside's name was also frequently mentioned in the servants' mouths. They also said that Henry Bode Sen had once beaten his wife. (To be continued)</p>
