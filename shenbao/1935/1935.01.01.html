<h3>元旦獻辭</h3>
<p>— 廷</p>
<p>論今後救亡圖存惟有修明内政</p>
<p>隆冬將殘，陽和漸回，我中華民國開基創業之第二十四週年紀念日·又與此元旦而俱來。吾人在今國難關頭，蒿目時艱，百感交集，雅不欲摭拾浮辭，迎春　歲，以作强顏之歡笑。惟念古人有言：「一歲之計在於春」，則又烏敢不藉此獻歲之日，掬其愚誠，論所期望？差幸朝野人士，不乏賢者，人心尚未盡死，國事亦猶可爲。我垂危臨絶之中華民族，其亦得如歲序之更新乎？馨香祝之矣！</p>
<p>慨自海禁大開以還，我國困頓匍匐於帝國主義之鐵蹄下者，垂百年矣。外侮之禍，在昔已甚，於今爲烈。九一八之奇變旣作，國人奔走呼號於國聯之門者亦旣力竭而聲嘶；然其無補於失地亡省之痛也依若。降至輓近，國際風雲更趨緊急，所謂一九三六年之危機，已顯示於吾人眼簾之前；而冥冥中陰暗之戰雲亦密布於東亞大陸。强鄰之對壘，日益露骨，劍拔弩張，一觸卽發，我固弱者，一旦戰禍　來，將何以逃避此浩刦乎？夫以今日情勢之危殆，固絶不能徘徊觀望，希圖僥倖於萬一；而外援之不可盡恃，又已有事實爲教訓。吾人誠欲自救滅亡，以安渡國難中之國難，則惟有自修明内政始耳。汪院長嘗曰：「修明内政，便是中國今日應取的外交方針。」斯固爲天經地義，絲毫不容假借勉强者也。</p>
<p>言夫修明内政，最重要之關鍵有三：第一曰：實行均權，第二曰：澄淸吏治，第三曰：完成訓政。凡此三者，看似老生常談，卑之無甚高論，實則治國之方，本無所謂玄奥神秘，但能抓住綱領，按步做去，則終有水到渠成之日。</p>
<p>（一）蔣汪兩當局嘗於五中全會之前夕，發表感電，語重心長，論者有目爲近年最重要这文獻者。該電首謂：「今日救國之道，莫要於統一；而實現統一，端在乎和平。」夫和平統一，夙爲國人所熱望；而在内外多故之今日，對此宣言，尤具特感。何則？國家至此，元氣垂盡，黃台之瓜，不堪再摘，民衆望治之殷切，直過於大旱之望雲霓！今最高軍政領袖，旣作此光明磊落之宣言，則地方當局，自更宜專心本職，壹意奉公，而不應相驚伯有，妄生疑懼。今後無論何人，如違背感電之意旨，仍師襲過去腐敗軍閥之故智，輕舉妄動，稱兵作亂，使此粗安之局，復趨於糾紛者，當知民具爾瞻，必不輕恕！蔣委員長去年十一月尾與日本記者談話，曽謂：「本人可保障中國不致再有内亂發生。」斯言尤可與感電先後相輝映也。然和平統一之抱負，必由中央與地方共有之；不然，若有一方違反時代潮流及民間公意，循至他方亦無以堅持其信諾，則是非誰屬，仍無以逃天下之公論也！</p>
<p>感電又云：「和平統一，固爲全國今日共守之方針，而欲其實現，則必須中央對於地方解除其牽掣之慮，消釋其疑難之端；同時地方對於中央，亦必須本休戚與共之眞誠，遵國家整個之政策，守法奉令，一掃昔日割據或形同對立之形勢。」於是主張以建國大綱所規定之均權制，爲劃分中央與地方權限之最高原則，然後復依此原則而定均權制之網要五端，作爲今後中央與地方共相信守之標的。吾人嘗覺：向來處中央地位者，往往標榜集權；而當地方政務者，又時以分權爲言：如此南轅北轍，不相爲侔，遂致各省獨自爲政，跡同分裂，中央號令固不出都門一步，而地方自治，以無國家憲法之保障，亦不獲有絲毫之進展。故國家徒負單一之名；而地方轉有割據之實。總理建國大綱規定：凡事務有全國一致之性質者，劃歸中央；有因地制宜之性質者，劃歸地方其用意無非使國家爲一脈絡貫通之整個的機構，惟在事務執行上作自然之分配耳。蔣汪二當局對於均權制之意義，早於去年二月之眞電，剴切論列，而立法院之憲法草案中亦復有此制之規定。惟何者爲實現均權之綱要，則鮮見有人作具體之主張；有之，自感電始耳。其中所舉之綱要五端，第一有關於法制，第二有關於用人任命之權，第三有關於地方行政及經濟設施，第四有關於財政，第五有關於兵警武器。凡此五端，皆有具體對象，可資依據，旣合情理，又切實際，，苟能推行得力，運用自如，則均權制之精神卽可發揮無遺，而去國家長治久安之道，亦已不遠。感電原則，業經五中全會通過，發交中政會議詳細規定辦法。吾人甚望該項辦法儘速頒布，尤願頒布之後，順利進　行。惟現實困難，終不可免；而最可慮者，尤爲五端綱要中之末項，卽一國家正規軍之管轄統制，須統一於中央，但在過渡時期，得依平時之統屬關係，對於部屬之任免，得由其最高主管長官呈報中央任命」是已。</p>
<p>去年初，汪院長對於閩變之發生，頗有感慨，一月九日，在中央紀念週席上，曽謂：「我國政治力量與經濟力呈不易集中，故時有軍人叛變之事；而因軍事組織之未盡完善，軍事訓練之未盡充分，軍士品質，遂致不能良好，往往爲將絞所操縱，而形成私人系統之軍隊。若此種系統不能消滅，則無論憲政無從實現，卽訓政亦無從實現」云云。而孫院長討論中國立憲之根本問題時，亦云：「中國没有成爲統一的國家，…最大的阻碍卽是軍權至今還没有統一」。蔣委員長總綰軍符，歷有年所，其感覺統一軍權之需要，自更較他人爲親切，故在五中全會之前，旣與汪院長發表感電，主張正規軍軍權之統一，而在江西綏靖期内，又决定試行徴兵制度，訓練國民，以期打破在昔募兵制度下地方蓄養私兵之惡習。吾人以爲將來中央果能制定法令，使最近甫經提倡之徴兵制度，得在各省盡量推行，則兵民二者便可打成一片，軍權軍令間可隨之而統一，而入伍士兵新陳瓜代，亦足樹立全國皆兵之先聲也</p>
<p>（二）我國歷代吏治之窳敗，夙爲世人所詬病。自國府考試院成立後，雖間有公開競爭考試之舉行，而現代文官制度之確立，則尚有待於將來。平心而論，在今日全國政治機關之職員中，才德稱位者固所在多有，而因緣親故，尸位素餐者，實亦不在少數。循至日常公文，亦胥由熟於掌故富有經騐之書吏包辦，一般長官惟知到衙畫稿，而在長官卵翼下之普通職員，在辦公室中，亦惟抽烟看報談天消閒而已。試問衙門書吏，成爲世　階級，包辦例公，關節賄賂之風，如何能免？吏治又如何能淸？今日創言建設者遍天下，而建設固惟人才是頼。若有才者懹抱利器，無所施其長，轉生怨望，甚或傳播社會不安之種子；而登庯者，悉頼於後援，一經當職，便爾優遊歲月，　糜公帑，甚或魚肉善良之平民，則欲現代文官制度之確立，誠與緣木求魚何異？解除靑年失業問題，本爲國家當務之急，今經委會與教部，亦固有全國學術諮詢處之設矣，然現代政府實爲作人之最大機關，其職責尚不在於居問之介紹，而尤在於實職之授與也。國内隨時隨地皆有「人人謀事而又事事需人」之怪現象，識者已有同嘆。欲圖補救，惟有下一絶大决心，一方裁撤駢枝機關，勵行節約；一方將因是而淘汰之人員，與其他機關中之事務官同受嚴格甄别，舍則留，不合則去；此外再就現職人員，授以補習教育，以爲執行每年抽考之張本。去冬，考銓會議召集於首都，吾人嘗審視其通過議案，大致皆在使考選挑拔眞才，銓叙避免倖進，用意未嘗不善。出席人員因有感於邊遠省份羅致人才之難，又决定中央與地方公務人員互調辦法，并擬着各省設立銓叙分機關，以便利銓叙行政之推行，此則尤爲吾人所贊同者。凡此種種，國人莫不樂觀厥成，惟總期各案經呈報中央分别制爲法令後，能盡量推行，使我國之文官制度得因此而奠定基礎，更進而發揚光大耳。總理有言：「教凑有道，則無枉生之人；鼓勵有方，則無抑　之士；任使得法，則無倖進之徒。」古今中外整飭吏治培養人才之原則，固不外夫是。一旦文官制度而能鞏固健全，貪贓納污之惡習固無由長此存在，而靑年失業之嚴重問題，亦可解决大半。至其影響所及，將使一般國民鄙視官吏之傳統的心理爲之丕變，更不待論也。</p>
<p>（三）我國今日猶在訓政時期，夫人而知之；而訓政時期，原定六年，將在今年三月以前滿期。立法院有鑒於此，乃於去年起草憲法，藉爲凖備。憲草最後定稿，業經五中全會加以審核，然後擬提出五全大會，再經五全大會通過，依法提出於國民大會。此爲法定手續，無可置議。按總理建國大綱規定，國民大會之召集，與夫憲法之頒布，胥有待於地方自治之完成；而地方自治之完成，又有待於調查户口，淸丈土地，興辦警衛，開闢交通等四大要政之完成。去冬，蔣委員長嘗有華中華北十省巿之巡遊，旣歸述其觀感，略謂：「各省對於四大要政中之警衛與交通二端，皆知注意實行，今後不難計年責效。……惟對於淸丈土地與調查户口，除寗夏一省外，尚多畏難不前，不惟未及實行，甚至尚未着手設計，此應從速促進實施以符訓政之旨」云云。凡我國人，固莫不熱烈期望總理手訂之建國程序能於最短期間按步實行；然今日去憲政之時機猶遠，則無可以否認者。如不顧現實，而　等以進，亦無取也。猶憶新任法長王用賓氏，對於憲草初稿嘗有意見發表，其言卽曰：「人民不經訓練，自治不經籌備，一旦訓政與憲政同日完成，在理論上事實上牽强實多。」吾人亦以爲三中全會雖已議决本年三月爲頒布憲法之期，然此點已爲事實所不許，則惟有在此訓政與憲政之過渡期間，積極訓練民衆自治，實行四大要政而已。四大要政中之淸丈土地，尤爲目前當務之急，而其工作之艱鉅，亦爲識者所公認。今後如因淸丈一舉，必須逐步邁進，難期速效，最低限度，亦須先行「查丈」，或土地陳報，蓋「查丈」辦訖後，不惟可藉以考正已往之魚鱗册，對於整理田賦大有裨益，且亦爲將來舉行淸丈時盡一必要的初步工作也。去年五月間之財政會議。亦嘗注意及此，以其爲訓政時期中最重要之設施，萬不容因循敷衍，長此拖延也。</p>
<p>夫推行訓政，原在「開導人民接受四權使用之訓練，指導人民努力完成地方自治所必備之先决條件。」故立法院於草訂憲法之後，又有縣巿自治法草案之發表，及人民四權行使法之擬訂。蔣委員長日前令飭勦匪省份之各縣改設區制，以期爲推進訓政樹立憲政之基礎，其用意尤爲明顯。惟今日問題之焦點，尚不在於善良法制之如何樹立，而厥在於法治精神之如何發揚，及法治基礎之如何鞏固。吾人深信全國人民處此空前未有之國難關頭，苟非喪心病狂，固莫不願與中央共同奮鬥，一致對外。中央望治心切，正不下於人民，當能發揚法治精神，鞏固法治基礎，使訓政與憲政間過渡時期得以盡量縮短，總理之建國程序得以早日完成也。吾人因敢揭　修明内政之三大要點，與全國朝野相共勉焉。</p>
<h3>和平統一之目的在集中力量以救亡圖存</h3>
<p>— 二十四年元旦　汪兆銘</p>

<p>民國二十四年之申報年鑑</p>
<p>— 張梓生</p>
<p>從「新」「精」「確」三點着力以求足供學術上之參考</p>
<p>集政治·經濟·文化·社會調查諸材料以謀適合各界之應用</p>
<p>（一）現代生活與年鑑　中國國民生活之日趨於現代化，已事實昭然，無待　説矣。現代生活，無論爲個人生計，或集體活動，均與正在推動演變中之各方面，在在發生關係。其優點，爲生活内容之豐富；其所使人感覺困難者，則爲與各方面關係之　複。於此，時事之瞭解，各種實際知識之具備，在中國各界人士之生活上，日増加其需要。出版物之應此需要而日益發達者，爲日報及各種定期出版之雜誌；應其作用之超越日報雜誌而異軍突起者，則爲年鑑。就普通性質之年鑑言：綜核一年來各方面活動之經過，彙編各種統計調查材料於一册。其功用，已由繁雜的片斷的報告討論，而進於整個的系統的奉獻；其便利，則使人得免搜集之苦，分購之煩，遇有需要，參考檢查於一册，而大略可得。本報總主筆張藴和先生述故總經理史先生刊行申報年鑑之旨趣，謂</p>
<p>…………人縱有極强之記憶力，亦安能得一年來之千千萬萬事事物物，藏於腦經，貫通融會而永久不忘。年鑑者，即將此一年所得，爲之爬梳淸理，以代各界人士於腦經中，記此不能記之事物，留此不能留之印像者也。然則年鑑之作，又烏能以己？</p>
<p>年鑑之裨益，於此約略可見。更進一步言之：今之人士，無論從政，執法，治學，及經營農工商業者，其於與各方面所發生之關係，莫不苦繁複，臄鑑乃以有條理之實際材料貢獻之；其於非本身專習之各種活動現象，莫不感瞭解之非易，年鑑則將各種實况作系統的編列，備其查考。</p>
<p>今人旣無法回轉時代，度其「與世無關」之生活，而對於世事之推動演變，又多感其繁複，則年鑑之綜括的報告，其需要之亟，自有其必然性也。</p>
<p>（二）申報年鑑兩次出版之貢獻　中國年鑑之出版，其最早者，爲欲瞭知中國情形之外人機關：日本東亞同文會調查部之「支那年鑑」，在民國七年時，已出至第三回：英文「中華年鑑」亦早由字林西報館逐年印行。中國人自編之普通年鑑，則以民國十三年商務印書館印行之「第一回中國年鑑」爲嗃矢。惟其續編，久未印出，致此後欲參考各種實際材料之學界人士，仍不得不取材外籍，而一般人更無由以簡便之方法，明白本國各方面之情勢。二十一年爲申報創刊六十周年紀念，館主史量才先生乃於館内増設年鑑社，創刊申報年鑑，以圖與日報月刊相輔，完成辦理新聞事業者之使命。余被邀主持編輯，社内重要同事章君倬漢，爲商務第一次中國年鑑編輯人；孫君懐仁，平日頗注意於材料之搜集，經騐學識，各有所長；陳君　雅，則奔走徴詢，以求各方之供給材料。賴國内各方之奬助，專家學者之合作，第一次年鑑於二十二年四月出版。乃更參酌批評家之言論及購閲者之意見，並廣請各方面專家之指導合作，將第一次年鑑澈底改編，於二十三年四月出版第二次申報年鑑。</p>
<p>余以申報年鑑主編之人，不敢於此自誇其成績，且兩次年鑑之成，多應歸功於供給材參與編稿之熱心掖助諸君；惟就此兩次出版之書而言，其對於國人，亦不能謂無貢獻：（一）檢查實際材料之人，可不必更行取材於外人之年鑑。因申報年鑑之編輯，事前參考搜羅，頗爲勤愼，　　諮詢，亦甚盡心，不特較新，亦且較確，此　於著作家之紛紛引用可知。（二）各界人士實用上之參考，稍獲便利。因申報年鑑所涉範圍甚廣，凡本國之土地，人口，氣象，以及政治，法律，經濟（包括金融交通產業），國防，與文化，教育，社會情形，世界概况，日用便覽等等材料，差稱具備。吾人常得政學商工各界，以信件或電話，來相商詢，頗以各界之不見窠爲欣悦，此亦可見以申報年鑑供實用上之檢查者之多也。（三）各種誤謬記載之訂正。中國現在通用之各種記載，不免有以訛傳訛者。第一次申報年鑑所選錄之記載，經請專家審閲後，第二次書中，或訂正刊錄，或不再錄用：如「各省現有鐵路哩數表」之改製，厦門租界及關於雲南邊地文字之更正，其尤著者也。（四）重要材料之介紹。曽世英先生新製之「全國各省區土地面積表」，翁文灝先生之「中國山脈考正」，竺可楨先生之「中國氣候區域説」，皆爲在學術上實用上極有價值之新文件，申報年鑑特徴取刊錄，一方使檢查者可免爲舊説所誤，一方則使此種文件與購用者相接觸，自信頗能増益其效用也。</p>
<p>（三）新年鑑編輯上之改進　申報年鑑旣承國人不棄，兩年以來，銷行遍於全國，購用者普及各界，編輯同人及特約撰稿諸君，各知自勉，以圖毋負國人之期望。向來編輯方針之可述以求教於各方者：（一）集編範圍廣泛之材料，以適應各界參考目的不同者之檢查；（二）聚彙各專家之所貢獻，分工合作，整理各種具有專門性質之材料，以求内容之日趨精確。（三）謀購備諸君實用上之便利，全部材料之分列於各門類，其適當與否，經社内同人之再四斟酌，覺尚有未妥，則分函請教於專門家及相知之備用申報年鑑諸君；務求各界人士，欲襝某項材料時，能以較少時間翻閲可得。</p>
<p>以上編輯方針，同人至今尚認爲大致不　，惟因兩次編輯之經騐，更得知所着力，今所着力之點：—</p>
<p>一，爲求新。編輯年鑑而自爲直接調查，　　自製各種統計，有識者皆知其不可能；採用現成材料，亦有覺其過於陳舊不適用者，現正實行通訊之間接調查。如與浙江圖書館合作調查全國圖書館，與一質調查所合作調查全國重要礦業公司，而民政司法之調查，則　績進行。</p>
<p>二，爲求精。以剪集雜錄而成之材料，　成巨帙，草率出版，固非同人所願爲；以前兩次出書，亦略於此端，知所盡力，作事後檢閲，亦自覺有若干部分，更須求精。現所可述者，如工業編之改請中國經濟統計調查所諸先生編撰，氣象編關於二十三年大旱象之説明，特約氣象研究所朱炳海先生作稿，即其例也。</p>
<p>三，爲求確，各種調查統計紀錄之正確與否，本來只有比較的標準，而不能絶對斷定。申報年鑑之内容，雖不敢自調完全無誤，然以各材料供給者及特約撰稿者，多爲專門研究家，或專業服務人員，平素與所貢獻之材料，常有密切之接觸，其求確之能力，當爲國人所能信任。今後更在「確」字用功夫，期此書正確之程度，與年俱進，庶國人之購用者，檢查所得，皆爲可信可徴之實用材料也。</p>
<p>（四）吾人所求助於各方者　申報年鑑旣風行全國，爲各界所備用，則其改進，除編輯撰稿人自盡其心力外，更不得不遍求全國各方之援助。吾人今要求：一，各學術機關及專門研究家，予以更密切之合作；二，各機關團體更以適用之材料見寄；三，批評界及備用年鑑諸君，能予以適當之指教。</p>

<h3>新年新語</h3>
<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>流光如矢，轉瞬已屆民國二十四年之新年，除舊佈新，在斯年頭，社會率流露一種新的氣象，國人亦懷抱一種新的希望。本刊未能例外，因於新歲伊始，述所欲言。</p>
<p>電信事業之進步。隨社會之需要而來，社會需用電信愈多，則電信發達愈速。故社會繁榮與否，影響於電信事業至鉅。近數年來，外侮侵凌，民生凋敝，農村多破産，商界不景氣，遭此環境，縱電信本身，盡力整頓，盡力建設，然營業之增加，每不能如當局願望，斯則發民電信，實有望於國内情形之改善，往事忆已成過去，但願自今歲始，全國上下，更能爲進一步之合作，社會日見安定，百業漸趨繁榮，庶電信事業，亦隨而更見擴展，此所希望者一。</p>
<p>過去一年，電信當局各種設施，歷見報載，無煩贅言。日月如轉丸，電信無止境，已定之辦法，發軔於過去，無須繼續推行者，則於今年期其完成，改進之新猷，察事業之需求，以圖積極發展者，則於今年期其努力。尤期全國電信界，同具目標，共策進行，此所希望者二。</p>
<p>本刊發行，已經歲餘，雖尚能勉副讀者期望，但亦未能遽謂満意，值茲新年，革新之心尤切，所盼外界與電信界同文。　賜關於電信方面新的作品，務求精警，不落陳舊，俾本刊内容，益見充實精彩，此所希望者三。</p>
<p>新年新年，充满若干新的希望。欲求此種希望之實現，全在乎不斷地努力。歲云始矣，景象丕煥，敬於此祝各界之進步，並期新年之努力！</p>
<h3>電信界之新精神</h3>
<p>— 楨</p>
<p>歲月不居，時光迅駛，二十四年元旦又臨頭矣。元旦者，人生最快樂之日，亦人生最興奮之日也。何云乎最快樂之日？蓋吾人終歲勤勤，刻無暇晷，或手胼足胝，從事個人事業，或勞神焦思，身爲國家服務，值此元旦休睱之時，無不及時行樂，舉酒慶年，欣欣然有喜色也。何云乎最興奮之日？蓋吾人生命有限，而事業無窮，忽忽數十寒暑中，除幼學老病而外，能作事之日幾何？能成就之事又幾何？慮有爲之日，具有用之身，安可不聚精會神以臨之，劍及履及以赴之？元旦爲一年充滿此項新精神之起點，故爲最興奮之日也。個人能貫澈此新精神，何事不成？國家能貫澈此新精神，何敵不克耶？</p>
<p>西洋物質文明，在我國仿行之者，以電報爲最早，始於光緖五年李鴻章之辦理洋務一奏。悠悠五十餘年，豈獨未能日新月異，追踪歐美，反以腐敗見稱者何耶？雖曰受時代環境之支配，抑人謀之不臧耳。何謂人謀不臧？卽無新精神以濟之是也。夫以中國面積之大，人口之多，謂不需要電信事業，决無是理！上之有國家政治力量，下之有人民經濟力量，謂不能發展電信事業，亦决不置信！然而所謂主持電信事業者，或故步自封，而不知進取，或畏難苟安，而不知振作，或支柱於政客軍人之際，而不知以其需要及其實際，公開於社會，得其同情而獲其援助。至於以辦理電信爲升官之階發財之具者，更卑無足道。坐此數因，中國電信事業，停頓在五十年之中，因循萎靡，「數十年如一日」，</p>
<p>自今以往，若無新精神以濟之，安知五十年之後，不仍如今日耶？</p>
<p>何謂新精神？卽不避艱苦，不計勞怨，具有縝密之心思，偉大之魄力，以事業爲前提以服務爲目的之精神是也。過去一年中電政之成績，昭昭在人耳目：關於國際通信者，有中英中日兩無綫電路之開放，關於國内通信者，有康定拉薩等邊遠電臺之建設，江陵泰寗等五十一電報局之成立，報話營業處代辦處之組織，有無綫電之合併，郵電合設之成功。此外關於組織制度之釐定，業務章規之改良，財務收支之統一，工程計畫之實施，部辦省辦民營電信事業之合　　　外主權利益之回收，電信人員之勤奮，社會人士之信譽，本刊迭有記載　社會自有定評，不必多述。説者謂過去一年來我國電信事業所　之變動，幾乎超過五十餘年來改革之累積，良非虚語。何以致之？曰新精神是已。</p>
<p>夫剝極必復，古訓昭然，由衰而興，事多前例。然亦視當局者之精神如何耳？苟認爲事業剝極衰極，而不思所以拯救，徒然徘徊躊躇於庭，咨嗟太息於室，則所爲事業，終必江河日下，萬刧不復矣。若有人者出，察其致病之由，求其診斷之道，熱心以幹之，毅力以行之，則其功效嘗超越吾人意料之外。我國電信，在過去兩年成數年前觀之，外受不平等條約之束縛，與天災匪患之摧殘，内有腐化惡化之積因，與支離破碎之局面，誰不抱無限悲觀而認爲無可救藥。然而一年以來之電信事業，經當局之梳剔芟夷扶植整理，結果證明圓滿，此係新精神之力也。</p>
<p>雖然，若謂電信事業，在過去一年中，已盡整理之能事，而登發展之高峯，又誰敢信？不獨未能比擬歐美，卽較諸日本，亦有遜色。不獨　總理建設有綫無綫電路計畫尚未實現，卽原有局　之改進，猶須加倍努力。而國際風雲，時呈緊迫，國民經濟，日處困窮，政治尚待淸明，匪共久稽天讉，種種事實，無不與電信間接直接有關。好在交通當局，决不以現狀自滿，决不以惡劣環境而懼，過去已成陳跡，新年必有新猷，拭目俟之可矣。</p>
<p>吾人值此新年元旦之時，應抱極快樂之觀念，下最大之决心，具無限之希望，貫澈本人之新精神，爲國家社會服務，同時擁護政府之新精神，爲國營事　發展，勿悲觀，忽躁進，恒以持之，毅以處之。最後勝利，非我莫屬。古人云：「一年之計在於春」，請自茲始。</p>
<h3>一來年之國際電台</h3>
<p>— 張承祜</p>
<p>去年元旦，本刊増刊有國際電台一暼一文，縷述交通當局建設國際電台之經過，以及現有之設備，營業情形。流光易駛，又及一年，此一年間我交通當局之努力建設，未見稍懈，則爲我國唯一對外　舌之國際電，其一年間之發展經過，當亦爲閔者諸君所關心，爰就其設備業務等項分别縷述如次：</p>
<p>（甲）擴充設備</p>
<p>欲求無綫電信業務之發達，端賴通報之正確敏捷，通報之正確敏捷，又賴設備之完善周密，善事利器，古有明訓，國際電台草創四年，規模粗具，爲求改進業務及適應需要起見，設備年有擴充，其在去年内所完成者，有如下述：</p>
<p>（馬可尼機）該機於民國二十二年一月開始裝設，至二十三年二月方告完成。計二十瓩短波發報機二具，附對歐束射天綫二付，對美束射天綫一付。又短波收報機四具，附對歐束射天綫三付，對美束射天綫二付。自該機完成後，歐美各通信綫路之機件支配，波長更迭，可以應付襝裕如。</p>
<p>（鎧裝地纜）國際電台發報台設於上海眞如，收報台設於寳山劉行，而中央控制之處則在上海公共租界仁記路沙遜大厦，三處聯絡，端賴遙控綫。該台原有遙控綫係架空電纜及銅質明綫，以盗竊虫嚙，風摧火燬，障碍叢生；爲根本救濟計，經添設五十對鎧裝地下電纜一條，由恒豐橋南堍接綫間起。經閘北恒豐路，大統路，交通路，桃浦西路，而達眞如發報台；再由該發報台經眞大路，滬太路，寳山縣道，而達劉行由報台。全綫共長四二·八七華里，沿綫並設試綫箱五所。二十三年一月開始應用，原有架空綫纜，仍留作不時之需，於是國際台之遙控綫路，永無中斷之虞矣。</p>
<p>（眞如發電廠）眞如發報台之電源，係仰給於閘北水電公司，其饋電綫路甚長，易生阻障；爲策萬全計，經在台内自設備用發電廠一所，原動機爲六百匹馬力之柴油機一具，發電量爲四百瓩，足供全台之用。二二三年二月間工竣，嗣後每遇巿電停　，立可開機供電，不虞影響報務。</p>
<p>（劉行變莊所）劉行收報台原以僻處鄕間，不能購用巿電，故自設發電廠以供需要。二十三年春，大塲大耀電氣公司向閘北水電公司購取電力，供給該地居民，該台乃乘機與該公司接洽，借墊資本，延長饋電綫路至劉行收報台，並在台内設置五十瓩六千六百伏脱至三百八十伏脱三柏變莊器一具。七月間裝竣，開始饋電，於是劉行電濟，亦得有巿電及自備電兩重之保障。</p>
<p>（修理所）國際台以規模草創，尚無工塲設備，機器另件之修配，深感不便。故交通部决於該台眞如發報台内附設修理所一處置備車床，鑽床，鉗床及一切手工用具。於二十三年三月間裝設完竣，該台收發報機件設有損壤，立予修理，所需添換另件，充份製備；並以餘暇，從事製造無綫電機件，以供國内各地電台之用。</p>
<p>（專綫交換機）凡商民應用電報，以迅捷爲第一需要，而金融界爲尤甚。國際電台與各銀行股票商間，皆有專綫聯絡，其收發電報，均藉是項專綫，利用電話，或電傳打字機，以互相傳遞。不復假手報差，傳遞速率，因以倍増，而商民樂用是項專綫者亦日多。該台爲適應需要起見，於二二三年九月十一月間，陸續裝設專綫交換機二具，可容電話及電傳打字機專綫各五十家，滬上商行如願收發電報特殊迅速者，均可向該台接洽租用。</p>
<p>（轉報快機）轉報者，國内各地電報經上海轉往外國，或國外各地電報經上海轉往内地之謂。辦理是項電報者，國内部份爲上海電報局，國外部份爲國際電台，故國際與上海電報局間，應有周密迅捷之聯絡。交通部有鑒於斯，特備克利特自動收發快機，專供該局台間辦理轉報之用，亦於二十三年九月間開始應用。</p>
<p>以上各項，爲國際電台在民國二十三年内完成之新建設，至在進行中之擴充設備，亦有足述者如下：</p>
<p>（擴充中央控制室）中央控制室爲收發電信之總樞，居中馭外，責任恭重，自當隨業務需要，擴張伸展。國際台設在沙遜大厦内之中央室，約占地二千方呎，近以報務日繁，不敷應用，遂决計擴充地位一倍，添設收發報桌稱是，並與原有者劃爲東西二部。現報桌業已佈置就緖，應用機件，若自動發報機，波絞機，拉紙機，　孔機，擴音機，印時機等。經交通部分别飭由該台自製，或購料委員會標購。迨完成之後，可成收報位置十五，發報位置九，並將亞美及歐洲各通信綫路，分配於東西二部，收發效率，當可倍増。</p>
<p>（添裝發報機）眞如發報台添裝二十至四十瓩短波發報機一付，内部裝設，業已　事，惟天綫尚未竣工，約至本月中旬，可以試機。</p>
<p>（擴充收報台）劉行收報台内添建電池室一所，業已落成，遷裝新舊電池及充電板，均在進行中。原置電池之處，改闢爲收報機室，添裝分集式收報機一付，及對歐對美天綫各兩付，以便採用分集收報法，免除短波衰落之弊，是項工程，約於本年二月間可以完成。</p>
<p>（増設無綫電話設備）無綫電話於近數年來已有特殊進步，歐美各國，相繼採用爲國際通信利器。我國國際電台急起直追，亦進行増設無綫電話設備。交通部曽於民國二十二年秋，向英國標凖電器公司訂購收話發話控制等機，撥交國際電台應用，現該項機件雖尚未運抵該台，顧其裝機地位天綫基址等，均已測勘妥定一俟機件到台，卽可裝設應用。</p>
<p>（置辦標凖測波器）無綫電事業日益發達，空間之電浪日繁，互相干擾亦日甚，前次馬德里萬國電政會議决定各電台所發電波周率，不得與所規定者相差逾萬分之五，且强制辦理。國際間通信之機關，必須置辦極精確之標凖測波器。以測騐其所發電波，而時加糾正。國際電台向無是項設備，每遇電波干擾，不知孰是孰非，雖他人詭稱國際台所發電波不凖，亦無從測騐辯證，惟有忍氣吞聲，默認而已。茲交通部已向美國購得標凖測波器一具，令撥該台，卽日裝置於劉行收報台中，俾可收取全球任何電波，而加以測騐，蓋不特專供測量該台自發之電波已也。（未完）</p>
<h3>電報與新年</h3>
<p>— 葆眞</p>
<p>時代的巨輪不停地向前推進，一年一度的新年又來到人間人們爲生活所驅使，不免離開故鄕作客異地。因此在故鄕的人，逢到新年佳節，難免想念遠客異鄕的親友，旅居外埠的游子，當然也要想念在故里的尊長或其他親友。所以社會習俗，在新年時節，往往互寄賀柬，一則彼此禮尚往來，二則藉以溝通聲氣。但是我國幅員廣大，距離遠些的地方郵遞信件，不是一天兩天可以到達目的地的，假定元旦日從上海寄往北平友人一封賀柬，也許隔了四五天　能達到，北平友人收到了賀柬以後，卽使立刻回答，又須隔了四五天　能到達上海。如此一來一往，最少須八九天功夫，新年時令，差不多已過去了。滬平兩地，還有火車直達，交通不能不算便利。那末交通不便的地方，如果互遞賀柬，豈不有失時效。我們怎樣可以補救這個缺點呢？我敢負責介紹，祗有利用交際電的一法。國内不論什麽地方，都能隨發隨到，决不至有誤君事。親友們接到了具有美術化的賀年電報，當然立刻回復一電，當天就能收到。迢迢千里，無異對晤一堂，所以我們如用電報向親友們賀年，一定能够使親友們精神上感覺愉快。</p>
<p>我國政軍各界對於長官或同僚，每逢新年往往發電道賀，又因不明電局定章，大都用印電紙濫發官電。惟賀電究係私人交際性質，按照修正官軍電報收費及限制辦法之規定，不能列作官電拍發。電局遇有此項不合定章之官電，作爲私事官電，予以扣留。且近來政軍機關主管長官，對於交部取締私事官電辦法，深表同情。聞有某師政治訓練處職員李某，因擅用師部印電紙拍發私事電報，被軍委會查明撤職。所以政軍機關公務人員，如欲問其長官或同僚發電道賀新年或升遷者，切勿違章拍發官電，致被中途扣留，甚至因此撤職。儘可照章拍發交際電報，旣無違法之事，又免被扣之虞，豈不是一舉兩得。且交際電定價低廉，國内各處不論本省隔省，華文每字僅收銀二分，較之官電每字收銀五分，相差三分之多，豈不更爲便宜麽？</p>
<p>華文交際電報之收報人姓名往二及收報地名在十五字以内者，亦得按照省費新章作爲五字計費，逾此照加。例如「上海亞爾培路逸安里一零八七號王俊年—欣逢新歲恭祝吾兄前途萬福藩」一電，全電僅按二十字收費，祇霝付銀四角，可謂低廉之至。際此新年佳節，各界仕女，如欲向遠地親友賀年者，惟有此價廉物美之交際電，可以使君滿意也。</p>
<h3>電報術語解（續）</h3>
<p>— 淸華</p>
<p>各種電報章程及本刊文稿中，時有習用之電報術語，在内行人見之，一目瞭然，毫不費解，但在局外人見之，輒覺意義不明，難於瞭解，爰續將常用之術語註解於後：</p>
<p>電信　電報簡稱「報」字，電話簡稱「話」字，業在上期本刊内説明。至「電信」二字，則係電報電話之統稱，不論有綫或無綫電報，巿内或長途電話，以及傳眞電報廣播無綫電，凡藉電氣而通信者，均稱「電信」。吾人謂電信事業，卽係包括上述各種之電氣通信事業也。</p>
<p>來報　爲發來之電報，卽收報人收到之電報</p>
<p>去報　爲發出之電報，卽發報人交發之電報。</p>
<p>轉報　爲中間電局轉遞之電報。</p>
<p>報底　卽書有電文之電報紙，去報底卽發報人原書之報底，來報底卽　收報局送交收報人之報底，轉報底卽電局轉遞時抄寫之報底。報底又有原報底及抄報底之别，原報底爲原來報底，抄報底則係照原底抄錄之報底，僅備查考之用耳。</p>
<p>報費　卽電報費</p>
<p>話費　話費分月租（或季租）與長途兩種，巿内電話按月所付之電話費謂之月租話費，長途電話每次之通話費，謂之長途話費</p>
<p>接綫費　長途電話經另一公司或電話局之巿内電話接綫通話者，須另加收一種接綫費，例如以前上海華界與租界接綫通話，租界電話公司每次須收接綫費五分。（註：現已免收，由交部賠貼）。</p>
<p>過綫費　長途電話經過兩家以上之電話局或公司之電話綫通話者，除應付本局綫路之話費外，尚須付他家公司綫路之話費，卽簡稱爲過綫費。普通長途電話價目，係將各費併合計算，並不分收。</p>
<p>抄費　收報人在兩人以上而在同地者，祇須發一張電報，另加「分抄」或「ＴＭＸ」之納費標識，電局在收到該電時，卽多抄若干份，分送各收報人。此項多抄手續，每電不逾五十字者，每加抄一份（卽有兩個收報人），收「抄費」洋二角，五十以上不逾一百字者加倍，餘類推。（交際電報之分抄費，每五十字僅一角。）</p>
<p>譯費　華文明碼去報交局代譯電碼者，每字加收「譯費」一分。來報代譯，不收譯費。</p>
<p>專力費　收報人居住並無電局之鄕鎭或輪船上，須由電局派專差將電報送去者，應加收「專力費」。（未完）</p>
<h3>電報賀年的摩登化</h3>
<p>— 中明</p>
<p>今天是二十四年的元旦日，在這新年日子裏，社會人士都忙着慶祝新年，彼此道賀。講到賀年的方法，也是日新月異，隨着時代進化。以前流行的各種賀年方法，都逐漸落伍，不適宜於這摩登的潮流裏。時代的巨浪把一切舊的衝散，新的推進，而賀年電報，也就是給這巨浪推進的一種最新交際利器。</p>
<p>電報賀年，在歐美各國，早已盛行，牠的範圍不限定於親友，一個平民對於國家元首或地方長官，雖不相識，也往往在耶誕或是年節的日子拍電馳賀，這是歐美民衆對於元首或長官的一種敬禮。在我國以前各地電局，也於歲尾年首開放賀年電報，但因報費並不十分低廉，未能推廣，自去年交際電報辦法實行之後，報費大减，每字價目華文祇收二分，於是公衆對於這簇新的現代的賀年方法都踴躍利用，聞去年中，各地電報局交際電報一項，收入具有可觀，而其中大半是屬於賀年性質的。這足見公衆對於電報賀年歡迎之一斑了！</p>
<p>但是，公衆的歡迎，並不是偶然得來的，其間有兩個重大的意義存在：第一是這幾年來，什麽東西都講求摩登化經濟化，凡能適合這條件的，都　能受人歡迎而盛行起來。人們對於陳舊　的賀年方法，都感覺到厭煩了，總想轉變換換口味，但又要不多化費錢而方法則新頴，在這種情形之下，電報賀年，無疑地風行一時了！</p>
<p>第二咧！凡是一件東西太尋常了，往往不能受人重視。賀年也是如此，倘使我們所用的方法太尋常　了，當然不能引起親友底注意，甚或認爲欠缺誠敬。我們對人賀年當然要情意誠敬，才可使對方有深刻的印象，而收聯絡情誼之實效。在各種賀年方法中最情意誠敬，而引人注意的，我想莫如電報好了！</p>
<p>關於賀年電報，尚有兩點值得同諸位注意的：聽説今年各電局爲酬答社會人士利用電報賀年的雅意起見，特備大批五彩精印之賀年電報封，上面印有藝術家所繪製的美麗的圖畫，這樣，諸君底親友接到賀年電報時，見到這美麗的圖畫定會非常愉快的。至於賀年電報的投遞時間，也有限制，早上八時以前晚上八時以後例不投送，免得驚擾諸位底親友，時代的巨輪時時推進着，預料今年拍發賀年電報將比去年更爲踴躍！</p>

<h3>一九三四年中國經濟的總結算</h3>
<p>— 馮維祺</p>
<p>一九三四年的中國經濟，是繼續着一九三三年的衰落，而更加深化的一年。在世界方面，因爲帝國主義者瘋狂般的準備戰爭，引起軍需工業之極度膨脤，和與軍需工業有關之產業相當回復，曽經造成了一種假景氣；但是在中國，則連這一種假景氣也都没有。不論農業工業商業都顯示極度的衰落。</p>
<p>現在我們就將這一年來中國經濟上所表現的重要事實，略舉幾項分述如下</p>
<p>一、受災荒之侵襲農村經濟更加衰落</p>
<p>中國的農村經濟，自從帝國主義勢力侵入後，便就無日不在崩潰腐朽的過程中，加以歷年來的戰亂，飢荒，土匪騒擾。苛捐雑税，國土被劫，國内巿塲縮小，於是更加速了崩潰腐朽過程進展的速度。去年和前年雖曽連告豐收，但因當時正值世界經濟恐慌最深化，和中國交通不便，以及都巿農村高利貨的剝削壟斷；因之不僅不能稍稍解救農民困苦復興農村，反而發生榖賤傷農的惡現象。今年則因爲普遍全國的十餘省區遭受旱災水災之侵襲，致農產物收穫鋭减。據實業部中央農業實騐所估計，本年夏季農作物產量，全國平均，僅當實足年收量百分之六十至六十五。卽早秈稻六○％，糯稻五八％，小米六四％，糜子六二％，玉米六一％，大豆五六％，甘薯六三％，花生六二％，芝麻五九％，烟葉六二％。其損失價值，同樣據該所調查，僅蘇，浙，皖，冀，魯，湘，陜，豫，鄂，贛，等十省，已達十四億四千五百萬元，且間接的損失尚不包括在内。現將該所已經發表的蘇，浙，皖，冀，魯，湘六省的受災田畝及作物損失總值列表於下：</p>
<p>受災田畝　作物損失總值</p>
<p>江蘇　　四九、四五五、○○○畝　二一八、○○○、○○○元</p>
<p>浙江　　二一、七九○、○○○畝　一六四、○○○、○○○元</p>
<p>安徽　　三七、○二七、○○○畝　三四六、○○○、○○○元</p>
<p>河北　　五七、三六一、五七九畝　二三九、五四八、七九一元</p>
<p>山東　　四八、○九四、四七七畝　一五○、六一五、六九五元</p>
<p>湖南　　二二、三八九、○○○畝　一八二、五二一、八九二元</p>
<p>總計　二三六、一一七、○五六畝　一、三○○、六八六、三七八元</p>
<p>從上表掁來，可見受災最烈者爲安徽，浙江，江蘇，湖南等產米最盛之省份。年來中國農民，因農村經濟破產已久，無日不彷徨於餓死綫上，如去年和前年的豐收，尚且輸入大量的糧食，何况今年的旱災爲六十年來最高之紀錄。故荒災一成，乞賑之聲幾遍全國，而各地的糧價也隨之一致上漲，如上海一埠，粳米由去年十月十六日至二十二日的週價最高點九元七角五分漲至今年八月十六日至二十三日的週價最高點十四元一角，相差將及四元半。就新米登塲後，也仍盤轉於十三元内外。茲將今年八月中的週米價格與去年同期的週米價格列表於下，以資比較。</p>
<p>日期　　粳米　　秈米　　糯米</p>
<p>二十三年</p>
<p>八月一日至七日　最高十三元　最低十二元八角　最高十一元五角　最低十元六角　最高十三元三角　最低十二元二角</p>

<p>八月二十四日至三十一日　最高十四元一角　最低十三元五角　最高十二元一角　最低十一元七角　最高十三元七角　最低十三元二角</p>
<p>二十二年七月三十一日至八月六日　最高八元九角二分　最低八元八角　最高七元三角　最低七元一角　最高八元七角五分　最低八元六角五分</p>
<p>八月七日至十三日　最高八元九角　最低八元七角五分　最高七元三角五分　最低七元○五分　最高八元六角　最低八元五角五分</p>
<p>八月十四日至二十日　最高八元九角　最低八元六角五分　最高七三角五分　最高八元六角　最低七元一角五分　最低八元四角五分</p>
<p>八月二十一日至二十七日　最高八元八角　最低八元六角　最高七元三角　最低七元二角　最高八元六角　最低八元三角五分</p>
<p>八月二十八八日至九月三日　最高八元七角　最低八元四角五分　最高七元二角　最低七元一角最高八元三角五分　最低八元二角</p>
<p>糧價高漲，因之災民無以爲生，致搶米之風潮也隨之而起。據各地報紙不完全的統計，僅七八兩月中，已有如下表：</p>
<p>地點　　　日期　　　參加人數</p>

<p>農産歉收，糧食不足，糧價高漲，不用說是要輸入大量洋麥粉以資調劑的。本年第四季的數字，因尚未發表，自然無從知道；但第三季已比第一二季激増，便是這一説明。然統觀三季來的進口數值四·一六三·七一一元。較之去則仍减少七四·六○○·○九九元，約百分之五九，（其中米糓數量方面减少百分之四○·六，價值方面减少百分之六○，小麥數量價值减少百分之六三·九），到底是甚麽道理呢？關於這點，倘若我們忽視了災後農民購買力之銳减，甚至無能力購買，和賑灵工作之有名無實，是無法解釋的。</p>
<p>當此農作物爱旱水灵侵襲，一致歉收聲中，差强人意的，只有棉作據中華棉業統計會第二次估計皮棉産額爲一一，一七二，五五三担，比去年最後修正估計的九，七七四，二○七担，増加一，三九八，三四六担。雖説今年的棉田面積爲四四，八○七，五七九畝，比去年最後修正估計的四○，四五四，○二三畝，増加四，三五三，五五六畝；但棉田面積増加的百分比，僅爲一○·七四％，而皮棉產額増加的百分比，則爲一四·三二％，故實際每畝平均的產額仍是増加（○·七斤）。倘若没有旱水災，則其產額必更増加無疑。</p>
<p>今年中，促進中國農村經濟崩潰的主要因素，除上述的旱水災外，尚有世界經濟恐慌之日益深化，致中國農產品繼續被擯於世界巿塲（如中國茶被排擠於印度，錫蘭，日本茶，中國絲被排擠於日本絲人造絲，和英美法等國家屢増關税阻止中國蛋品之輸入等），和美國實施購銀法，吸收中國存銀，使農村金融愈加枯竭，以及各國大量輸入農產品傾銷，豪紳地主高利貨之加緊剝削，苛捐雑税之繁重等，也是不可忽視的。</p>
<p>二，農村購買薄弱工業益形不振</p>
<p>中國的工業，不用説也是和農業一樣，其衰落由來已久。而衰落之原因，實不外下列諸點：（一）外貨傾銷，國貨不能與之競爭，國内外巿塲幾被侵奪殆盡；（二）農村經濟破產，人民購買力薄弱；（三）國内政治未上軌道，政府保護不足；（四）資本太小，金融界不與合作，技術落後，發展困難，且易倒閉。</p>
<p>年來各界雖效法歐美採取經濟的國家主義，竭力動員提倡國貨，然而成績實屬有限；故一九三四年的中國工業，承上年的衰落而更加甚。茲擇其主要諸種分述於下：</p>
<p>棉紗業　　棉紗業之衰落，可由停工减工，生產减退，紗銷不振，紗價低落中看出。據報載，今年要半年，完全停工者有十一廠，紡錠三十四萬枚，停夜工者有三廠，紡錠十萬枚，共計四十四萬枚，約佔華廠總錠數百分之十五，而縮短工作時間（每尾期工作五日或六日）者尚不在内，故今年上半年全國紗廠的减工率，就使不如去年上半年有名的普减百分之二十三（去年上半年完全停工者十二廠，紡錠四二六，六八八枚，全停夜工者四廠，紡錠九七，二八八枚，總計全國减率約百分之二十三，停錠逾總錠之半數），但恐怕相差也必不遠。下半年雖有漢口震寰民生裕華，鄭州豫豐等廠先後開工，然也决不下於去年下半年停錠百萬枚。停工减工錠數増加，生產减退是無需乎證明的了。至於紗銷不振和紗價低落，我們可從廠存棉紗和紗價變動中窺見。上海爲全國較好的營業紗廠，而一九三四年五月尚九七，○二一包廠存紗，就經過秋銷最旺期的八月，也尚存八九，六四四包，比之去年六月的一二三，八五五包，及十二月的一二三，二四○包，雖稍見减退，但這是積年减工减產的結果，絶非紗銷之暢旺。如比一九三二年十二月的七一，八二○包，相差尚有一萬七千餘包至二萬五千餘包之多。上海如此，其他各地便可概見了。至於紗價之變動，有如下表：（以一九三○年爲基數）</p>
<p>支别　　一九三二年　　一九三三年　　一九三四年（春季三個月）</p>
<p>四二支　最高價　八八　最低價　五三　　五七　四九　五○　四九</p>
<p>三二支　最高價　九九　最低價　七一　　七六　六五　六六　六四</p>
<p>二○支　最高價　九八　最低價　七五　　八○　六七　六九　六六</p>
<p>一六支　最高價　九五　最低價　七四　　七八　六八　六九　六六</p>
<p>一○支　最高價　九四　最低價　八一　　八二　七二　七○　六八</p>
<p>從上面看來，可見紗價雖直綫的下跌，但存紗的减退甚微，這是説明紗價的跌落，無濟於紗縮小。所以實部工業司科長李崇典氏於調查上海麵紗絲三業後曽説：「上海方面有紗廠三十餘家，各廠均减工維持，最近紗銷雖略見起色，减工之廠先後恢復，但係臨時性質，而紡成之紗，仍難獲利。」（見十月十三日上海中華日報。）</p>
<p>此外，我們還可以舉出許許多多事實，如號稱中國棉紗業托拉斯榮宗敬氏所創辦的申新等廠之擱淺等來證明，但上面所述，已頗充分，故不須乎如此了。</p>
<p>絲業　　一九三四年的絲業衰落，比棉紗業更甚。據國際貿易局統計，本年絲銷不但毫無轉機，抑且衰落更甚，三季中生絲輸出數額，尚不及五千公担，價值不過二千零五十餘萬元，較諸去歲同期减少達十分之五强，金額計二千萬元。絲價由一九二九年間最高標凖滬廠經每担一千六百餘兩，跌至今年的四百元左右，（去年五六月間每担九百餘元，八九月間每担五六百元）；因之各地絲廠不得不相繼停業，如上海中華日報十月一日所載「江浙二省在昔日本有絲廠一百八十餘家，絲車四萬餘部，現因受經濟衰落影響，開工者僅七十餘家，絲車僅一萬八千餘部。」又如上海原有單雙宮繅絲廠一百十三家，除一二八滬戰時被燬五廠，尚有一百零八家，去春勉强開者六十八家，今春則更减爲三十三家，共計車頭七千二百餘部，且其中尚有一部分係屬臨時性質的代客　兩。然這三十家勉强開工的絲廠，現在也不能維持，而减爲十四家了。他如廣東之順德也僅開工三家，停工十四家：並且這些勉强開工的絲廠大半都是時輟時作。從此便可窺見今年絲業衰落之一斑了。</p>
<p>麵粉業　　麵粉業也爲我國的重要工業之一。現在全國除東北不計外，共有麵粉廠八十三家。内江蘇三十八家，山東六家，河北湖北各九家，河南四家，安徽山西各三家，湖南一家，而以南部之上海，北部之天津，湖北之武漢爲最盛。每年全國產量達八千二百餘萬包。</p>
<p>此業當本年上半年，也和其他各業一樣瀕於絶境，但下半年頗量活况，其原因正如上海銀行公會秘書長林康侯氏所説：「是由於本年各處水旱災奇重，</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>五穀不登，災黎遍野，所謂物以稀爲貴，以故麵粉業得乘機崛起。現在粉價步漲，且銷路亦頗暢旺，故本年年關百業凋敝中，惟麵粉業可以安然渡過。」（見十二月九日上海中華日報）</p>
<p>火柴業　　火柴業在中國工業中雖不如棉紗業絲業麵粉業，但也爲　興工</p>
<p>業之一，然近一年來，因外貨厭迫，銷路呆滞，存貨堆積，售價慘跌，也紛紛宣告破產。除蘇浙皖鄂四省八廠爲謀自救而合併爲中大國火柴有限公司統制營業外，近更普遍的限制生產，藉渡難關。</p>
<p>橡膠業　　據上海橡膠同業公會稱：「最近華僑在海外經營橡膠事業失敗後，滬橡膠廠亦因海外橡膠跌價，日貨傾銷，同業紛紛競爭，供過於求，使價格大跌，廠商無不虧本。最近上海現存三十七家中，竟有二十五家紛紛倒閉，而剩餘之十二家，雖能勉强維持，但在總結賬期間，亦岌岌可危。」（見十二月三日上海中華日報）</p>
<p>此外，如洋灰業，搪瓷業，熱水瓶業，毛織業，製帽業，洋傘業，化裝品業，玻璃製造業，製油業，電器業等，皆無一不因農村經濟衰落，外貨傾銷，金融枯竭，而表示不振。</p>
<p>總之，一般説來，一九三四年的中國工業，可説是已到山窮水盡的地步了</p>
<p>三、存銀巨量流出都巿農村金融俱皆枯竭</p>
<p>年來因農村衰落，内地政治不安，全國資金都紛紛集中都巿，而以銀行爲其最後之尾閭；於是便造成了農村金融枯竭，都巿金融膨脹之畸形現象。這雖非今年特有的情形，但尤以今年爲甚。就以上海而論，中外銀行庫存，由去年底的五四七·四四七千元，増至本年五月底的五九四，零六五千元。此後雖逐日减少，截至十二月六日止，已激减至三三四·一零四千元；但這一激减，决不是流入内地，而是由於美總統羅斯福六月二十一簽署白銀收買法令，和八月九日簽署白銀國有命令，使國外銀價飛漲，急劇流出的結果。這一流出雖經九月十五日起徴收白銀出口税及平衡税後仍是没有停止。據報載，最近也曽有好幾批白銀運入内地，如南方之厦門汕頭，北方之天津秦皇島等處；然而這些流入内地的白銀，决不是全部都是爲了救濟已經枯竭了的農村金融，和採辦農產品而運往的，其中至少有一大部分是爲了避免海關徴税，需要經過内地然後偸偸摸摸私運出口的，比如十一月十二日香港工商日報載，謂該地銀行界傳出消息，前後偸運至香港的白銀，已月二千萬元之多，便是一例。白銀的巨量流出，對於中國民經濟打撃之重大，固不用説，而對於金融業之影響，首先便是使建築於現銀基礎上的現時中國金融制并發生危機。因爲銀貨外流，銀底鋭减，發行凖備必受限制；於是在硬幣已缺乏的情况下，更益以紙幣之無法増加，而導到通貨不敷，信用收縮，銀根奇緊，國内流通資金益欠圓滑。現時雖還没有達到這樣嚴重的地步，但上海的洋拆由平時極度鬆濫的一二分漲至最近的二三角，便是告訴我們：倘若長上此以往，危機終有加緊之一日。其次便是因白銀巨量流出後。信用收縮，銀根奇緊，而工商業益形不振，致銀行錢莊放出之期賬不易收回，而發生週轉不靈以至倒閉。</p>
<p>一年來，帝國主義特别是美帝國主義的貨幣政策，除了使銀價高漲，引起中國的存銀巨額流出，而給與中國金融業以莫大打撃外，尚有銀價之漲落無常，致外匯標金之價格起跌不定，而損喪了中國許多銀行錢莊。據統計，僅九月十九至十月二日二星期中，便有上海的德康金號，天津的宏遠銀號，義聚銀號，義生銀號，裕聚銀號，恩慶永銀號，恩慶厚銀號，誠明銀號，寗波的裕康花莊，春榆錢莊，恒新筍廠，年豐米廠等十餘家相繼倒閉。雖説外匯最近有外匯平巿會之組織，和改由關金結價，標金投機有政府明令取締，然試看上述的金號銀號錢莊相繼倒閉，和外匯平巿會之空洞無物，便可證明這樣的救濟防止是何等的無力了。總之，一年來的中國金融業，可説完全是在無抵抗下，受帝國主義侵略的經濟政策壓迫，過動搖不安的日子。</p>
<p>此外，我們還可以從發行營業動向方面來觀察一年的中國金融業。</p>
<p>關於發行，有如下表：</p>
<p>本年六月底止　　本年十一月底止</p>
<p>中央銀行　　　七○、八四四、○○○元　　　七九、四九三、三七九元</p>
<p>中國銀行　　　一一二、四一九、○○○元　　一三六、二九八、○三五元</p>
<p>交通銀行　　　四一、○二三、○○○元　　　五六、三八二、四三一元</p>
<p>浙江興業銀行　八、八八三、○○○元　　　　八、六一○、○○○元</p>
<p>中國實業銀行　三二、○六九、○○○元　　　三二、二三三、四一三元</p>
<p>中南銀行　　　三五、八四八、○○○元　　　三○、八五九、一七三元</p>
<p>四明銀行　　　一七、○八四、○○○元　　　一六、五○四、○○○元</p>
<p>中國通商銀行　二一、六八九、○○○元　　　二○、四○○、○○○元</p>
<p>中國墾業銀行　六、七○一、○○○元　　　　六、七一○、○○○元</p>
<p>中國農工銀行　五、七○一、○○○元　　　　五、九七二、七六二元</p>
<p>總　　　　計　三五二、三七○、○○○元　　三九三、三五九、二○三元</p>
<p>從上表看來，可見本年六月份上海各銀行發行總額爲三億五千二百三十七萬元，較去年同期的二億七千九百四十五萬八千○四十六元，増加七千二百九十餘萬元，卽十一月份的三億九千三百三十五萬九千二百○三元，也較去年底的三億四千三百八十六萬三千三百一十一元，増加四千九百四十九萬五千餘元至於營業，本年除擴大投機，縮小工商業放欵，和繼續其他業外，尚有農村放欵繼續嘗試。小借欵之盡力推行，和鐵道公路投資之競相爭奪等。</p>
<p>四、商業蕭條與國際貿易萎縮</p>
<p>一年來的中國商業，是繼續着過去的蕭條而更加萎縮。比如號稱爲中國最大商埠的上海，南京路石路等繁盛區域，因周轉不靈而歇業的商店已有百數十家，特區及南巿法院每日受理這一類的訴訟案件，比往年増加一倍以上，而法院執行封閉商店的事件，也必日有數起，平民金融機關的當舗，因只當無購而倒閉者，則有同源裕成等數十家。杭州商業，也並不因杭江路及公路網之完成而稍有補救。九江進口除軍火外，一般商品皆有產銷税之徴收，而轉安慶武穴，出口則比往年减二三倍。漢口則因爲政府統制特貨買賣，巿面大爲淸淡。據漢口商品檢騐局報告，本年七月與去年同期比較，出口貿易除紅茶，綠茶，桐油數項外，其他如棉花，茶油，牛皮，蛋製品等，均大見减退。輸入從一月至九月約二千一百萬元，比去年同期减少六百萬元。華中惟一大都巿的荒凉，於此可見。</p>
<p>全國最富庶之區長江流域的情景尚且如此，那末經過日本帝國主義鐵蹄踩躪和加緊控制下的華北一带，則更不用説了。河南開封自今春信昌號倒閉後，全巿金融界營業異常蕭條，運輸，雑貨，綢緞生油等類，皆門可羅雀，其中尤以生油商爲最，倒閉者已有十餘家。天津因内地農產品及皮毛等出口奇减，巿面也極并泠落。山西各商號，因社會貧困，營業税所得税等之徴收，　多倒閉。據太原，大同，祁，解，汾陽等三十五巿縣報告，銀錢等四十二業舊有商號六千七百五十七家，本年新増一百五十三家，而倒閉者則有一千八百三十八家之多，現在全省一百零六縣，歇業商號，約在四千家左右。内蒙除熱河外，各主要城巿均極衰落。張家口比起去年戎馬倥偬時，巿面已稍形安定。包頭運糧進城，無人過問，全城備極蕭條。西北各省，如西蘭公路因客貨甚少，汽車自百輛减至半數，收入尚不敷油資，可見巿面的衰頽。甘肅平凉，一月之内倒閉商店有八家之多。</p>
<p>華南方面的商業，除在一般不利的條件下，更受華僑匯欵减少的影響。廣州各業皆競賣圖存，據香港工商日報載：「今年廣州生意之不景氣，實爲空前所未有，全綫崩潰堪虞。」東江貿易重鎭的汕頭，金融本極混亂，自本年九月間發現大量商庫券後，巿上貿易幾全部停止。此外，如福建廣西等省，比廣東尤形衰落。</p>
<p>在這種的情况下，雖帝國主義竭力傾銷，而本年的輸入仍是激减。據海關報告，從一月至十月輸入累積數爲八七四·一一四·○二九元，較之去年同期的一·一五七·九二三·八九○元，减少二八三·八○九·八六一元。而輸出也由去年一月至十月的五○六、·九五四·六九八元，减至本年一月至十月的四四一·八六五·八五○元，計减少六五·○八八·八三九元。因此入超也由去年一月至十月的六五○　·九六九·二○一元，降至今年一月至十月的四三二·二四八·一七九元，計减少二一八·六二一·○二二元了。</p>
<p>總之，一九三四年的中國經濟，可説是在帝國主義天災人禍層層壓迫下，而更加衰落了。</p>
<h3>一九三五年世界經濟的趨勢</h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>過去一年間。世界經濟。總算是受盡了摩折。可是來年何如呢。據目前的情勢。以推察將來。也不難得到相對的明瞭。我們中國同在世界動盪中動盪着。並且受國際間嚴重的影響。假如我們分辨國際的趨向。對於已國經濟形勢的動向。也有相當的帮助。</p>
<p>現時世界上有三個比較重大的經濟問題。</p>
<p>（一）通貨膨脹政策的前途何如。</p>
<p>（二）歐洲金本位制度是否動搖。</p>
<p>（三）將來的巿塲如何開拓。</p>
<p>通貨膨脹政策。在我們中國國民經濟發展上。除了理論上討論過以外。實際的整個的經騐。是没有的。從前如民國初年的「軍用票」。武漢的錢鈔。山西的晋鈔。廣東省鈔等。不能算是膨脹政策。現在所謂通貨膨脹政策。至少要具有下述兩種經濟作用。</p>
<p>第一，使物價提高。自一九二九年世界恐慌發生之後。主要各國。都因爲生產過剩。消費力减少。而物價下跌。所以不能不設法提高物價。要現有產業界不致停滞。貨幣價值减低了。物價自然相對的提高起來。同時還有一作用。是刺激新興的產業。</p>
<p>第二，是開闢新巿塲。當一九二九年秋季美國股票風潮之前。各國都實行歸復了金本位制度。穏定了貨幣價值。因此就無形中减低了般薪水所得及工資所得。國庫預算也跟着縮小。所以一般社會的消費力。同其减低。結果國内巿塲的消化力就狹小了。海外巿塲。在主要各國。都有一點保護貿易的意味。而各用銀國家。反轉是輸出占上風。向她們輸入。竟受蹩價高的限制。一旦實行了膨脹政策之後。不僅可以對用銀國家増加輸出。並且還可以衝破關税墻壁。爭取海外巿塲。國内巿塲。也可以因一般工資的増加。而略爲擴大。</p>
<p>然而實際上得到通貨膨脹利益的。祇有英國和日本。一則是她們放棄金本位比較早。二則她們都從事於特殊巿塲。如殖民地的開拓。比其他各國更便利。美國自一九三三年四月纔放棄金本位。一九三四年一月。又實行减低貨幣價值。可惜是遲了。所以未曽得到什麽實際利益。現在繼復興法之後有新政策。而且到一九三四年六月止的財政年度。財政不敷計三十六萬二千六百萬美金。公債増加了四十五萬一千四百萬美金。在勢將不能不繼續施行通貨膨脹了。况且新政策的實施。還需要五十萬萬以至二百萬萬美金的新支出。</p>
<p>現時主要諸國除法。德而外。都實行通貨膨脹政策。一方面努力向海外爭奪巿塲。他方面在國内則盡量擴大國家經濟的權力，要已國獨占國内的巿塲。非必不得已决不容許外貨輸入。如美國輸入生絲。及　鑛。日本輸入棉花和鐵鑛生鐵。這樣一來。就祇有向產業比較落後的國家。或殖民地巿塲發展。可是在這些巿塲的本身也是經濟衰頽。根本上。購買力就異常縮小。要想比現在還擴張得更大。差不多會要不可能。並且還會更加縮小。南美諸國。人口旣少。農產品又没有消塲。欲將這塊巿塲再擴大恐怕是作不到的。中國人口多土地廣。近年來也民窮財竭。片面的輸入増加也是很難。</p>
<p>至於她們國内的巿塲。美國那樣大的國家。而失業人數竟有一千一百萬。這些人没有工作。又那有消費餘力。英國也與此相近。失業尋常在二百萬以上。英帝國内的經濟聯盟不過救濟一時。日本近年來是資本主義諸國中經濟情形最好的國家。但是一九三四年秋季各產業部門都有向下衰微的傾向。原因是對外輸出减少。將來的希望很微薄。所以通貨膨脹政策的前途是不可樂觀。而且悲觀材料還很多。</p>
<p>到現在依舊保守着金本制度的法·比·瑞·荷等國家。在歐洲誠然執着金融界的牛耳。也曽宣言過不放棄金本位。原因是她們從前吃過歐戰期中通貨膨脹過度的大虧。特别是德國到如今還留着那時候的惡影響。但是最近很受英·美諸國减低貨幣價值的激盪。尤其是法國物價越見低落。藏金也有减少的傾向。貿易以外的收支也是减少。海外貿易當唏要落在英·美·日之後了。最近。减低貨幣價值的呼聲。在產業方面又漸見高張起來。恐怕她也很不容易長久的保持金本位下去。否則她們這一圑金本位國。就不能和非金本位國爭經濟的勝負。不過放棄金本位。實行膨脹政策。也未必就有特殊的利益。</p>

<h3>日本宣告廢約與今後之東亞問題</h3>
<p>— 王紀元</p>
<p>倫敦海縮第二次預備會商，自十月二十三日開始以來，卽呈黯澹無光之象，美日，英美，與英日之三角談判，雖不絶如　，而三國之立塲與會議之爭點，始終未有絲毫之變更，日本以進攻之戰略，高唱廢除比率主義而代以國防平等權，美國以海岸綫長短與保持東亞門户開放爲理由，堅决反對變更現成比率，英國則以圓滑之手腕，取調解之地位，從事雙方之折衝，會議由技術之爭讑，進至三方政治意見之試探，復由政治意見之　柄，回到技術問題之　持，輾轉循環，幾達二月，迨日本樞密院通過廢約之聲傳出，談判始於十二月十九日宣告無期延會。</p>
<p>霹靂一聲，日本廢除海約之正式通告，已於十二月二十九日發出，僅存殘骸之華盛頓海約，至此乃被日本撕毁無餘！</p>
<p>日本廢約之凖備，進行已久，其所以遲遲發表者，一則欲以此居奇，使英美諸國對遠東利益，自動讓步，對華盛頓海約，自動宣告修改，二則欲聯合法意，採取一致宣告廢棄之行動，以壯聲勢，後廣田外相與駐日法意兩使會談之結果，該兩國政府，均不願作此表示，日本乃不得不於去年歲暮，作單獨宣告廢棄條約之舉，並揭明其所持理由有二：（一）彼以爲當華盛頓條約簽訂之際，敵方艦隊通過太平洋襲轚日本，尚屬不可能之事，今則不然，近年海軍界迭經研究，海軍迭經演習，證明太平洋不但可以踰越，且太平洋海戰結局，在數字上佔優勢之艦隊，必獲全勝；（二）彼以爲自「滿洲國」成立以來，東亞形勢，爲之一變，且目前世界政治局勢，又甚緊張，殊足威脅日本在東亞之地位，故該約已不合時代需要，將來足以招致日本在國防上之缺陷，因此以一九三六年滿期之機會，决定廢棄。實則此種論調，適足以彰其侵略之野心，東亞政治之緊張，日本實負其責，此不待辯而自明，以目前日本海軍力與各國情勢言，英美更無襲轚日本之可能與必要，亦屬昭彰：以吾人觀察，日本依據條約，進行宣告廢棄，雖爲其應有之權利，然其作用，不外二端：</p>
<p>第一，自九一八以來，日本以武力佔據我東北四省，建立傀儡國，同時，復宣告退出國聯，再進一步作獨佔東亞之聲明，列國態度不一，莫敢披其逆鱗。日本亦知全世界方捲入不景氣之狂瀾，各國必不願在此時與之較長論短。以故宣告廢約，此實其時。華盛頓海約廢棄後，日本不但可以根據其客觀環境之需要，自由製造軍艦，更可以利用其强大的海力擴張其對外侵略，封鎖西太平洋，使一旦發生戰事，列國軍艦，若不冐險，不能越雷池一步。</p>
<p>第二，華盛頓海約旣告廢棄，與華盛頓條約同時簽訂之九四公約，四國恊定，實際上亦連带失其效能，門户開放，旣須重加探討，太平洋上海軍限制，亦須重訂新約，不但華盛頓條約體系，宣告崩潰，卽國聯在太平洋之控制勢力，亦一舉而摧毁，本年二三月間日本太平洋委任統治之返還問題，更可不必討論。</p>
<p>所以，日本宣告廢約，雖僅係根據條約之一種合法行動，然其意義至爲重大，不但不能與海縮談判，分别討論，亦不能與太平洋中之任何問題分離，其影響於東亞政治問題之前途，更爲重大，今後海縮問題之中心，已進至如何收拾此支離破碎之殘局，成立一富有伸縮性之妥恊，以保持太平洋上暫時之安寗。至於中國問題，則英外相西門，在其演辭中，曽言：「英政府以爲與世界和平最有重要關係者，莫過於在遠東而有特殊利益，負有特殊責任之各海軍國，繼續恊定海軍之限制，並以旨在維持遠東境内各國間友好關係之集合制度，從事合作。」西門此言，已將海軍會議中癥結問題，暴露無遺，日本旣昂然宣告廢約，此後之問題，不過是如何進行共同處置中國之方法問題而已。</p>
<p>關於東亞問題之解决途徑，海縮預備談判會中，已有二種模稜體的傾向，一方面日本極力勾結英國，以在滿投資和保障在東亞之利益爲誘餌，企圖英日同盟之死灰復燃，以排除第三國在華之勢力，英國保守黨固抱海外巿塲擴張主義者，自亦樂與周旋。另一方面，美國以保持遠東門户開放相號召，鼓吹英美的密切合作，並且主張擴大太平洋三國會議，另成立一英，美，日，法，意，俄諸國的汎太平洋恊定，以海軍技術問題，納諸政治問題解决條件之中。日人譏美國之此種企圖，名之爲「單相思」，實際上，英美合作去客觀條件成熟之時期尚遠，且以英美之關係言，遠東問題必不能與「艦型」及「總噸數」問題相提並論，以英日之關係言，遠東政治問題與技術問題必須合成一體，此外，法，意，德，俄諸國在遠東之活動，亦爲不可忽視之事實。</p>
<p>所以，目下東亞問題之中心，卽：（一）英美合作乎（二）英日結合乎（三）抑在遠東所謂有特殊利益，負有特殊責任之各國普遍恊調乎？西門外相所指明之集合制度，顯明是指遠東問題之解决，必須採取第三條途徑，至少英，美，日三國，必須以友誼之方式，成立三角關係之妥恊，如此海縮會議之僵局，始可打開，所謂軍備平等與比率主義，主力艦與輔助艦之論爭，始能成立一新的恊定。</p>
<p>現日本已正式通告廢約矣！倫敦海縮預備會各國代表，亦將悄然各回本國，海縮之初幕悲劇，已宣告結束，今後之問題，已轉移到對東亞問題意見之折衝，我國以無强大之海軍，成爲列國羣思染指之俎上肉，吾國人將一聽列强之宰割而默然忍受乎，抑思奮發圖强，認淸目標，作抵抗外力侵略之凖備乎！際此歲序更新，民國二十四年來臨之際，敢舉此以問國人。</p>
<h3>一九三四年世界政治之回顧</h3>
<p>— 任湘</p>
<p>戰後的世界自從陷入總恐慌的深淵以來。屈指已經六週年了。在這一九三五的年頭。我們回顧過去一年的世界政治。從他恐慌的開端起。比已往内容上究竟有怎樣的轉變呢。從一般的形勢説來。世界政治是一年一年的走到日形尖鋭的階段。那個趨向。是非常明瞭的。一九三○年以前。我們且不去説。單從一九三一年説起。那年在歐洲方面的政治鬥爭是主要的伏藏於金融風潮的後面。把維也納，柏林，和倫敦一起捲入了這個漩渦的中心。到了一九三二年德國國社黨的運動。漸見抬頭。而軍備平等的呼聲。也卽於是時提了出來。這當然是反映了中歐覇權的竸爭。已入了一個新的階段。一九三三年劈頭。一聲。便是希特拉掌握德國政權。因而歐洲政治。轉變了一個方向。後來，列强的企圖妥恊。在七月倫敦經濟會議中。證明着完全失敗。和英國調停法德軍備的結局。只成了法國對蘇關係的接近。德國的退出軍縮與國聯。那都是一些必然的事情。奥意在此時結合。便又證明中歐和東南歐的新風雲。正在那兒積極的醖釀。我們現在回顧一九三四年的歐洲政局。其糾紛的内容。是當然的更加進一步了。其次，在太平洋方面。是一樣的可以看出個　個形勢來。在九一八（一九三一年）事變發生之後。接着一二八上海中日戰爭的爆發。於是太平洋列强的矛盾關係。才一步一步的緊張起來。到了一九三三年的二月。日本進兵熱河。迄於塘沽恊定爲止。一方成是日本已宣布退出國聯。他方面是國聯在中國的技術合作讦劃。正在那兒發動。同年。還發生了幾椿和太平洋大局有關係的事情。第一是七月間倫敦白銀恊定的成立。第二是十一月間美國對俄的恢復邦交。我們把這些經過和一九三四年的遠東政冶對照一番。當然可以看出列强在太平洋的矛盾關係。是一竟在那兒發展的。</p>
<p>造成今日列强間如此關係緊張的基本原因。是什麽呢。槪括的說來。約有兩端。第一。是列强對於殖民地利益奪取的加强。因爲在今日列强支配下的世界政治。主要目標。是在於資本和商品市塲的支配。以此。因殖民地的奪取而引起的衝突。便是不可免的事情。第二。是列强國内經濟的不安。目前主要的國家如英美德法日意各國。大都在生産方面已受了重大的打擊。因此便更加湧出了廣大的失業人民。國内經濟的不安。是造成國際關係對立狀態的一個主因。這是我們說明一九三四年世界政治上兩個不可少的基本觀點。</p>
<p>現在我們得將一九三四年世界政治形態的重要内容。說一個大略。</p>
<p>在太平洋方面。第一棒。值得我們注意的。是英帝國新加坡的海軍會議。（一月二十六日。）這次會議的召集。正是指出日英因爲印度洋和太平洋市塲競爭的原故。英國東方直布羅陀的建築。正和日本的軍事布置有先後相映的姿勢。日本企圖鑿通暹羅境内的克拉海峽。其效力不但引起新加坡之驚恐。且定使暹羅的不安。其次。自一九三三年以來。列强因怵於日本勢力的膨脹。頗有不甘放棄的表示。日本因此。　有一九三四年四月十七日的天羽宣言。這一方面使國聯的技術合作計劃。不能不稍受影響。他方面。則在追使中國屈服。在這個形勢之下。日本不但在東北和内蒙的軍事設備。已日形顯著。就是在其他各地。也可看出她力量的活躍。再次。日本在東亞的領導力量如何。是當然和她的海軍軍備有密功關係。所以一九三四年十月在倫敦召集的海縮預備會議。便不能不因日本的强硬要求。使日美的對立。成爲不可掩的事實。華府條約。遂有廢止的結局。這是無異於公開的說。太平洋的和平基礎。已經要地軍備競爭的威力之下。完全犠牲了。</p>
<p>一九三四年中。歐洲政局的糾紛狀態。比太平洋方面。似乎爆露得還更加緊張一些。在這個年度驚人的第一聲。便是一月間陶爾斐斯對於奥國國社黨的壓追。奥國之所以如此。當然是由於國際方面「有恃無恐」。可是。德國却不能因此甘心。所以七月二十五日的政變。陶氏竟在此糾紛中犠牲。幸虧國社黨方面眼明手快的放篷轉舵。維也納的惡風雲。便立時消散了。但是。還有一點值得注意的。就是英法意一向年倡對奥的聯合行動。到這時候。已顯然比一九三四年以前减去了不少的聲色。這是主要的說明了法意在中歐和東南歐勢力角逐的展開。</p>
<p>誰都知道法外長巴爾都的政策。是在於鞏固凡爾賽體系的陣系。因此。他一方面結歡蘇聯。鼓吹東歐互助公約。另一方面动團結巴爾幹和中歐小恊約諸國。收指臂之效。可是。波蘭因此就和德國接近。而東南歐的局勢。便更加緊張。十月間南斯拉夫王亞力山大和法外長巴爾都。不能不在馬賽給他們的敵人犠牲。這又是很悲慘的一幕。</p>
<p>歐洲風雲在如此動亂之中。法國和　聯的關係。却有進一步的發展。這就是　　　一九三四年九月十八日加入國聯的事件。蘇聯加入國聯。是醞釀　英國調解法德軍備以揚德抑法的當兒。那是誰都知道的事實。這一事件的實現。便顯然指示了歐洲和平的破裂與否。不過在旦夕間的事情。德國在這個形勢之中。尤有和平不易維持的困難。如果她的國内政治糾紛。不是如目前的和緩。恐怕歐洲大局的和平。不會維持至於今日吧。</p>
<p>從太平洋到歐洲。我們在上文已將一九三四年的世界政治説了一個大略。瞻望未來一年的世界政治。大局是怎樣的呢從歷史上的發展推測。目前的世界。已顯然轉入了劃時代的醞釀時期。太平洋的軍備競爭。是一九三五年一個非常重要的特質。其次。歐洲各國的内部政變和外交緊張。恐怕要與一九三五年有同時並進的形勢。如果將這兩方面合起來看。對於人類的世界和平。不能不算是一個總威脅。至於怎樣能實現世界和平維持的計劃。我想總是一九三五年中世界人士一個共同責任吧。</p>
<h3>國貨教育實施方案</h3>
<p>— 潘文安</p>

<h3>江蘇財政之整理</h3>
<p>— 趙棣華</p>
<p>一，緖言</p>
<p>江蘇夙稱財富之區，物產豐僥，商務發達，惟比年以來，情形變易，不獨私人經濟，呈窘迫狀態，公家財政，亦如中落之家，雖門第依然，而實力已盡，左支右絀，羅掘俱窮，至於事業之發展，則更不遑計及。作者蘇人，深疑蘇省財力，何以衰落至此，嘗考究其原因而不得。去冬奉命筦蘇省財政，荷此重任，未始不戰戰兢兢，然昔日之疑，能得實際以考證，且緣此而確立整理方案，循序漸進　，其能盡事功於何種程度，雖不可料，日就月將，自能推行盡利。茲分四項言之，庶一年來蘇省財政之整理，於此可見一斑云。</p>
<p>二，整理財政之原則</p>
<p>整理財政，初非一蹴可幾，逐步進行，其效自見，用將整理原則，分省縣兩部分言之：</p>
<p>一，省財政</p>
<p>甲，統一收支　省財政過去之實况，在收支保管方面，各以專欵名義，由各機關自行處理，各以其收入來源，支配用途；收入較多者，則盡量擴大其支出，　費公欵，爲數實多，收入較少者，深恐入不敷出，力圖開　財源，人民負擔，因之加重。兩者各有其弊，收支若能統一，省方財政，有整個系統，酌盈劑虚，通盤籌畫，不偏不倚，各項事業，得平均發展，循序漸進，茲爲實行統一收支起見，爰訂省專欵保管存支辦法，俾臻統一。</p>
<p>乙，確立預算　預算爲財務行政之南針，就一般效用言，（一）可决定政府將來事業進行之標準，（二）爲整頓收入約束濫支之工具，（三）爲取信於人民之證據，（四）爲表示政府行政之計劃，使各種事業易於管理。預算之功效旣如上述，然編制之時，應以事實爲依歸，設稍涉浮泛，則將反成欺世之具。蘇省省預算包括一切收支，收入方面得分爲三大類。</p>
<p>（一）普通省税　爲田賦營業税契税，現加菸酒牌照税。</p>
<p>（二）各項專欵　計教建二種：教爲田賦屠宰税及牙税。建爲田賦及事業收入等。</p>
<p>（三）其他收入　爲中央補助欵，沙田官產收入，及司法或雜項收入。</p>
<p>支出方面：爲黨務·行政·司法·公安·財務·教育·實業·建設·衛生恊助費等。在過去之省预預算，未能將收支全部列入，故整個狀况，不能表現。自二十二年度起將一切收支全部編製，以求統一。</p>
<p>丙，厲行金庫制度　江蘇省金庫向由中國，交通·江蘇·農民四行代理。依法規規定，凡收得省欵，應即解入金庫，但事實上未能辦到。有時延擱至數月之久，屢催方解。在延擱期間，縣長可存入私人户下，藉以生息，故金庫之設置，未能收效。自二十二年各縣會計主任逐漸設置，遂以督促解欵金庫爲責任之一，並訂有繳解欵項辦法，嚴密監督，推行數月，其效乃著。</p>
<p>丁，實行稽核制度　事前審計與事後審計，均爲監督財政之要政。蘇省前曽設立稽核委員會，但不久即復取消，致各機關支出，漫無限制，實非愼重計政之道。因於二十二年三月，製定江蘇省政府稽核委員會組織章程，及稽核細則兩種。規定：一，省地方欵項之動支，其支付命令，應由該會簽。二，凡省政府及省府直屬各機關之收支計算，均由該會審核。於二十三年度實行，雖爲時不久，然確能收監督財政之實效。</p>
<p>戊，改革田賦制度　蘇省田賦制度，積習至深，僅憑書吏挾其私存圖册，以爲鴻秘。花户之地址不詳，畝分不實，一任書吏之飛洒隠匿，以致有地無糧，有糧無地，或田多糧少，田少糧多，種種弊混，悉由此而生。自去歲冬季以來，即籌備改革。今年所進行者，爲下列諸端。</p>
<p>（一）辦理土地陳報　去歲十一月問，曽由廳派員，分赴各縣調查，實地考察，乃决定先從鎭江宜興溧陽江陰等四縣先辦。先經充分之籌備，及普遍之宣傳，於今春開始辦理，結果尚屬完滿，所有户領坵册，及坵領户册，俱已編造齊全，至二十三年度即以之爲造串根據，續辦土地陳報者，有：句容·太倉·吳江·金壇·江都·鹽城·銅山·睢寗·沐陽·沛縣，揚中崇明·興化·蕭縣等十四縣，正在進行中。</p>
<p>（二）整理田賦附加　蘇省田賦附加，至爲繁雜，盡人皆知，統計全省附税不同名目，多至一百零五種，而附税之超過正税，亦有自數倍，至十數倍不等，雖其中有因正税過低，致顯示附税之特别加重者，然其繁而且雜，自亦無可諱言。業經根據中央法令，嚴加整理。在辦理土地陳報縣份，所増溢之田，其新増之附税，完全充作减輕附税之抵補，如宜興即其一例，見下表。</p>
<p>（三）變更徴收辦法　關於徴收田賦手續之變更者，有下列數點：</p>
<p>（一）銀行代收税欵　蘇省田賦，積弊至深，一般不肖書吏，復從而上下其乎，浮收中飽，已成爲公開之秘密。爰於二十三年度規定銀行代收税欵辦法，使税欵直接由納税者繳納於銀行，而不經過書吏之手，則浮收中飽之弊，當可革除。惟此項辦法，係新定制度，爲愼重起見，先指定鎭江·吳縣·宜興·吳江·崑山·江陰·實山·嘉定等八縣試行，數月以來，推行尚稱順利。</p>
<p>（二）串票改銀爲元　蘇省田賦，向以銀兩計算，人民應納税欵，則以銀元繳納。銀兩銀元間之如何核算，納税者茫然不知，書吏即藉</p>
<p>此浮收。爲擴淸此種積弊起見，迭經嚴令各縣於串票之上，一律註明田畝科則，及應納税額之銀元數目。人民照串納税，浮收之弊，因而减少。</p>
<p>（三）投櫃完納　爲謀人民納税之便利起見，於縣總櫃外，復於四鄕酌設分櫃。俾納税者得將應納税欵，就近投櫃繳納，不必假乎書吏，是一剔除浮收中飽之一法。</p>
<p>二，縣財政</p>
<p>甲，整理預算　蘇省各縣預算，向送財廳審核，惟事實上不加審查，故其結果，非虚收實支，即　列收支，自不能約束計算，各縣地方機關服濫支出，不一而足。爲整理財政計，故首定整理預算爲原則。</p>
<p>乙，設立金庫　以前之現金收支程序至爲紛亂，凡税收機關，保管機關，及支用機關，權限分劃不淸。自今年七月以來，設立縣金庫，凡屬縣地方欵之收支，俱由金庫經管，訂立縣欵收支存放辦法，及江蘇省各縣縣金庫暫行規程，以劃分之。如此辦法，則以前省縣欵互挪之弊，完全袪除。</p>
<p>丙，厘訂會計制度　各縣設立會計主任，管理會計，所有縣政府動支欵項，報解欵項，抵解欵項，以及借墊欵項，單據契約須簽名署名蓋章，與縣長連带負責。其所處理之會計爲省欵及縣欵兩部分。</p>
<p>丁，推行稽核制度　關於預算執行，曁現金程序，詳加規定。凡超過預算之支付，稽核機關，得拒絶簽付，事前審核，已屬周密。又規定造送收支計算書類辦法，凡浮濫及不合法之支出，加以剔除，則事後審核，亦可依據執行。</p>
<p>綜上所定原則，於最短期間，已分别訂立法規，遴選人材，努力推行，其進行程度，述於下節。　　三，整理工作之進行</p>
<p>蘇省財政，積弊已久，故改進原則，雖已確立，而推行之際，障碍猶多，懹疑者有之，阻撓者有之，省方剴切勸諭，使一般民衆，咸知改革之意義與利益。茲就整理工作之大者言之，有以下諸端。</p>
<p>（一）預算之改革　省預算之改革，可分下列四點。</p>
<p>甲，編造時期　過去之省預算，因各主管機關往返磋商之故，費時甚久，及至乎續完成，而年度瞬將終了，往往失去時效，此次編製省預算，即力免此弊。</p>
<p>乙，收入部分　二十二年預算，不事虚儗，全憑實際，故收入之估計，與結果不至相差甚遠。</p>
<p>丙，支出部份　固定者，如各機關之經常費。不固定者，如事業費及臨時費等。在總預算成立以前，先由各機關編製分預算，俟分預算審查確當，再行　編省預算。俾基礎正確，於執行預算時，絶無窒碍，此亦編製預算程序之一改革也。</p>
<p>關於縣預算之改革，可分下列四點。</p>
<p>甲，審查程序　自二十二年十一月起，由財政廳組織各縣預算審查委員會，分别召集各縣縣長開會，作初步審查，各廳亦派遣代表出席。初審後各縣即依據審查結果，重新編製新預算，按期提出省府會議，作最後之决定。</p>
<p>乙，估計收入　田賦及其他收入核實計算，求一收入總數，再求支出總數，以便成一收支平衡之預算。</p>
<p>丙，核减支出　各縣概算所列，均有浮濫不經濟之支出，乃大加核减，其核减之原則如下。</p>
<p>子，無存在必要之機關，應裁去，節省整個經費。</p>
<p>丑，不經濟或不急需之支出，應删减，</p>
<p>寅，臨時支出不得列入經常。</p>
<p>丁，確定科目　各縣田賦附加名稱繁多，亟應統一。故改革預算，即行歸納爲田賦縣税，其分配另以百分法比例註明。</p>
<p>（二）統一會計制度　各縣設立會計主任，專事處理税欵會計，凡屬縣政府所收税欵，均須入賬，其特點如下。</p>
<p>甲，該項賬册，僅記税欵之收解，不涉支用。</p>
<p>乙，該項制度，成爲縣政府會計之中心。</p>
<p>丙，賬表之功用，偏重於現金之繳解與存放。</p>
<p>丁，賬册偏重於統計，用以攷核征收成績。</p>
<p>（三）設立縣金庫　各縣凡設立農民，江蘇，中國，交通，四行分行，或辦事處者，均委託爲代理金庫，迄今已有四十五縣成立，將來尚須普設。</p>
<p>（四）實施稽核制度　事前審計，可分爲預算之審核，及簽發支付命令兩種。而事後之稽核，則在証算書之編造，及决算之審核，現省縣欵項之審核，分兩機關辦理。</p>
<p>省方—由省政府稽核委員執行</p>
<p>縣方—由財政廳審核。</p>
<p>四，今昔財政之比較</p>
<p>蘇省過去之財政狀况，因收支未能統一，在財廳僅管理財務之一部分，致不能全盤統計，現就省税田賦收入狀况，將過去一年度，與經整理後二十二年度比較觀之，其收入如下：</p>
<p>二十一年度實收九百八十五萬元左右。</p>
<p>二十二年度實收一千一百九十七萬元左右</p>
<p>收入部分除田賦以外，即以營業税爲大宗。二十一年度營業税收入爲一百三十四萬元左右。二十二年度營業税收入爲二百三十九萬元左右。</p>
<p>就過去情形言，財政之紊亂，不僅收入短細，而預算之不能確立，使支出之期望，往往與事實相去遠甚，此其病，使事業停頓行政效率减削，如二十一年度預計歲入二千七百萬元，而實際收入僅一千八百七十五萬元，二十二年度預算收入爲二千二百餘萬元，實際收入達二千三百餘萬元。（連同借欵，約二千八百餘萬元。）</p>
<p>省方收支狀况已如上述，而各縣縣財政之收支狀况，因過去各縣無統一會計制度，欲求精密完整，頗非易事，就其大體言，類皆虚收實支，歷年虧耗頗鉅，其中最矛盾者，爲一方因地方事業關係，入不敷出，而另一方面，則農村荒落，急待减輕人民負擔，在事實上，收支相去遠甚。</p>
<p>就過去之縣財務行政言，蘇省曽有兩度之變更，其組織爲</p>
<p>一，以縣政府爲收欵主要機關—縣府徴收田賦契税（一部分解省，一部分用於縣）及雜捐教育局建設局等徴收一部分雜捐，至創辦未久之營業税，則由財政廳設局徴收。</p>
<p>二，以財政局爲收欵主要機關—其特殊點爲以財政局代替縣政府收税（一部分解省，一部分用於縣，</p>
<p>上述兩種制度，均有弊端，二者僅爲徴收權之轉移，縣長可以舞弊，局長亦何獨不然。其缺點在無監督機關及牽制之制度，故蘇省財政，仍有率亂現象。</p>
<p>作者認爲欲財政趨於正軌，先宜嚴密監督，使主計立於超然地位。於縣政府外另設會計主任，同時因預算計算制度之確立，及收支程序之改進，使會計主任之職權，易於執行，會計制度，其效乃著。</p>
<p>整理結果，凡支出之浮濫者，大加削减。在收入方面，苛細擾民之雜捐及田賦附税。分别廢除及减削。其情形如下表</p>
<p>廢除苛捐</p>
<p>次　數　　種數　　　　銀　　　數</p>
<p>第一批　四十二種　一○○、一七四、元○○○</p>
<p>第二批　九十八種　一三二、七○七、元四○○</p>
<p>第三批　八十八種　九五、五二一、元○○○</p>
<p>附註：第四批擬廢除之苛雜，爲數較多，約八十餘萬元，現整理已竣，一俟抵補有欵，即予廢除。</p>
<p>减輕田賦附税</p>
<p>縣　名　　　附　税　减　輕　數</p>
<p>宜　興　九五、七一六、元二三八</p>
<p>金　山　四、六五四、元○○○</p>
<p>海　門　二九、四三二、元○○○</p>
<p>靑　浦　二、九九○、元○○○</p>
<p>吳　縣　二二、四八○、元○○○</p>
<p>溧　水　七七二、元○○○</p>
<p>武　進　二八、元○○○</p>
<p>合　計　一五六、○七二、元二三八</p>
<p>就整理後之預算言，各縣之收支科目，亦歸統一。總計全省各縣二十二年度之支出。約計如下數：</p>
<p>一，黨務費約八十萬元</p>
<p>二，民政費約一百九十五萬元</p>
<p>三，公安費約六百零五萬元</p>
<p>四，教育文化費約九百三十六萬元</p>
<p>五，財務費約二十八萬元</p>
<p>六，建設費約二百四十八萬元</p>
<p>七，衛生費約九萬元</p>
<p>八，教濟費約五十萬元</p>
<p>九，積穀費約三十萬元</p>
<p>十，淸丈費約一百四十三萬元</p>
<p>十一，債務費約五萬元</p>
<p>十二，恊助費約一百三十一萬元</p>
<p>十三，預備費約五百三十八萬元</p>
<p>縣地方財政，向無數字可稽，自此次整頓以後，深信已有軌道可循。以上犖犖大端，爲整理財政之主要步驟，其他如統一地方捐欵徴收，亦進行不遺餘力。</p>
<p>五，今後之期望</p>
<p>地方財政趨於正軌，絶非主管財政者設施之力能收大效，必由一省人士通力合作，方克有濟。作者於蒞任之始，即以財政公開爲目標，使人人皆能信賴政府。旣能信賴政府，然後乃能奉行政府法令。茲旣有此鎡基更望各方通力合作，此所期望者一也</p>
<p>地方之財源，全視社會秩序及巿面金融爲轉移。設民生不能安定，金融不能流通，則財源定陷於窘迫之境。反之則財源定可呈充裕之象，其間之因果關係，至爲顯著。現在省府施政綱要，一方以建設爲基礎，使社會之生產繁榮，一方流通金融，貫注於農村。使行將崩潰之社會基礎，促進其生機，以後社會秩序，必可逐漸安定，財源通暢，各事自可舉辦，此所期望者二也。</p>
<p>至於財政之種種設施，在掌管者，固竭智能，以期得有相當效果。但恐千慮不周，猶有一失，吏祈海内明達，時時惠教，以求至善，是更於各種期望之中，尤覺深切者也</p>

<h3>提倡國產綢緞之要義</h3>
<p>— 季</p>
<p>四五年來。國難日亟。非徒外侮嚴重。天災瀕仍。卽整個國民經濟。亦陷於崩潰破產之絶境。值茲歲序晚新之會。我國人可不乘機振作。力圖復興。振作之道。匪僅一端。而提倡國货貨。减輕入超。更爲當務之急。</p>
<p>本巿綢業公會及湖社二圃體。有感於此。日前特呈請中央。通令全國。凡遇舉行紀念週。重要會議。以及喜慶喪葬等事。均應遵照民國十八年四月十六日國府所公佈之服制條例。採用國綢禮服。今日元旦。湖社且舉行禮服運動。表演國綢禮服之優美。夫衣食住行。本爲民生主要之活動。而衣冠得體。尤足表彰大國民之風度。蔣委員長以提倡新生活運動爲已任。其言云。「禮義廉恥。一定要從日常生活中表現出來。］不幸國人中無論男老幼。昧於此理者。幾隨地皆是。故在歲時令節。參加盛典。衣非禮之服者有之。服舶來之料者亦有之。至甚焉者。且招搖過巿。得意忘形。其有失國民體統爲何如。影響國貨銷路者又爲何如。總之。此風不改。非徒足以辱身。亦且有害民生。此國綢禮服</p>
<p>運動之提倡。所以有足多也。</p>
<p>我國產絲綢。本係高貴衣料。海通以還。輸出極多。無奈年來因我國民間種桑飼蠶繅絲織綢之術。故步自封。鮮有改良。益以人造絲綢之盛行。他國絲織品之競爭。國外巿塲。遂致一落千丈。至於國内之摩登仕女。則又崇尚洋休。國產綢緞。鄙不悄顧。坐是綢商折本。絲廠倒閉者。在在皆是。而蠶户之破產。工人之失業者。又何慮數百萬人。興念及此。良用寒心。言夫救濟之道。必有待於國人之覺悟。毋因愛御西裝而杜絶國綢銷路。際此國難嚴重時期。吾人縱不能臥薪嘗胆。枕戈待命。亦應發掦愛國心理。顧慮國民經濟。然則在可能範圍中。服用國產絲綢。固吾人應盡之義務也。</p>
<p>吾人又覺提倡國綢。未必不能與穿著西裝一事。並行而不悖。蓋愛服西裝者。大抵以其輕便美觀。未必卽有舍己從人之意。而其選用舶來衣料。更未必有絶對排斥土產之心。故爲破除習俗起見。宜有人出而試用國產綢緞爲西服。同時絲綢製造廠家。亦應竭力改良出品。使其色澤質地。皆適合於裁製洋服則在無形之間。亦可増廣國綢之銷路不少。不然。卽使絶對禁止國人穿服西裝。國產綢緞銷路恐仍不免爲外貨所侵奪也。</p>

<p>（二）在「滿洲國」成立當時、恐日本内地之大資本家向其進展、聞僅許商租十五萬町步、不得超過限度、但此次不加以此種限制、許日本人自由商租矣、</p>
<p>（三）上項日「滿」商租權交涉完全圓滿解决、嗣後日本人在「滿洲國」境内商租土地、期限爲三十年、（期限屆滿仍可更換）</p>
<p>今後移民及其他自由各點、均可充分活動、故將來日「滿」經濟上之緊密連絡、發展當可期待也、（三十一日日聯電）</p>

<p>（東京）美國方面認日本通告廢棄華府條約、爲發生新事態、故爲應付此事之意義、於明年再開之預備會商或提及遠東政治問題、亦未可知、前美代表台維斯曽非公式語松平代表曰、日本如通告廢棄、美國同時不能不提及遠東政治問題、外交當局關於此點、正警戒美國方面之態度、而美國所以必提及遠東政治問題者、其表面之理由、以華府條約係於大正十二年華府會議與九國條約同時簽字、故兩者有緊密之關係、蓋係片面的見解、然外交當局决以下列理由、反對美國之見解、卽（一）華府條約與九國條約簽字者不同、且由華府會議之時間的經過觀之、兩者並無關係、（一）通告廢棄華府條約、係以達到新軍縮恊定爲目的、若使之與政治問題發生關係、此乃美國猜忌日本之故、（一）日本在遠東不獨無違背九國條約之事、且尊重九國條約、熱心希望中國之門户開放、已經屢次聲明、想美國當已理解、（一）爲防止因華府條約喪失效力而發生之不安事件起見、日本對補充或再確認四條約之提案亦願參加、惟與歐美間各國討論政治問題、再演日内瓦國聯總會之愚、則絶對反對、（三十一日電通電）</p>
<h3>英美報紙抨擊日毀海約</h3>
<p>（倫敦）自由主義派孟却斯脱保衛報、撰文評論日本宣告廢止華府海約一舉、對於日本政府所採政策、嚴詞抨擊、結論謂「吾人現有兩種職責、（一）先以限制海軍軍備之原則爲基礎、訂立新恊定此項原則當予確定、不可稍涉含混、（二）在太平洋方面恢復一種國際制度、務使較强者無覬觎之念、而較弱者無受侵略之慮」云云、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國各晨報評論日本廢止華盛頓條約之舉動、大都謂此約尚有兩年、方告期滿、而在此時期中、當可獲有解决海上軍縮難題之方法故海軍國競造軍艦一層、可無足慮也、晨報郵謂更大主力艦與飛機母艦之建造、將使財政担負超過其所給安全之上云、每日電聞謂據世界海軍家一般意見、日本在其自己海上、似有完全而不能攻破之安全、若他國則不然、固無日不得不唯完全是求也云、泰晤士報謂、日本廢約一事、當然可視爲嚴重、蓋雖日本外交已使其廢約舉動、有一種慣例之形式、但有不可掩飾者、十三年前所成立的國際恊定之高尚建築、已爲此所摧毁矣、第日本旣宣佈另締新約以代舊約之志願、而近來談判之進行、復有坦</p>
<p>白與好意之表示、新約之成立、似非絶無希望也云、（三十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（紐約）紐約泰晤士報在社論中評論日本宣告廢止華府海約、標題爲「孤立非榮」、大要係謂「日本有宣告廢約之權、無可爭辯、惟至少日本行動、並未顧及他國、可謂不合分際也」、該報以爲華府海約、係於一九三六年底滿期、按照該約第二十三條規定、各締約國若未於滿期以前兩年宣告廢止、則仍繼續有效、至締約國中一國宣告廢止以後兩年爲止、彼時卽視爲全體廢止、是則至多延至一九三八年底、該約亦必自動宣告廢止、日本固有待至一九三八年之可能也云、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>蘇俄空軍威力</h3>

<p>海參崴伯力駐有氣球隊</p>
<p>（哈爾濱）據由俄境來人云、蘇俄極注重空軍、其空軍之威力尤大、現除在國境方面集結戰鬥·轟炸·偵察等機之外、尚有下記各種空軍補助器材、（一）爲宣傳空軍智識及訓練精神、對靑年男女教授使用救命傘、其成績甚佳、被訓練之男女九成以上能操用、（二）在海參威及伯力有氣球隊五中隊、尚在國境方面演習、（三）訓練以水上滑走橇使飛機離陸、增進寒帶地空軍之威力、（三）以名爲飛行橇者組軍作橇隊、卽在橇之前面設有風輪、附屢於部隊、增進機動力、（三十一日華聯電）</p>
<h3>意法談判發生頓挫</h3>
<p>中歐保障問題意見懸隔</p>
<p>修改和約非法國能贊同</p>
<p>賴伐爾羅馬之行將展緩</p>
<p>（巴黎）法外長賴伐爾本擬在本週内往游羅馬、但法意間之談判、今日忽發生障碍、故法外長羅馬之尾、或將因以展緩、據法方消息、關於奧國獨立之担保、及意國對於匈國要求修改和約之同情、已發生困難、按匈國因和約之規定、土地大减、故要求修改之、（卅一日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）負責方面對於意法兩國間目前談判情形、有所説明、謂談判中間、並未提及修改歐戰和約問题題、兩國年磋商者、實係各關係國獨立及領土完整之尊重而已、（卅一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）法意兩國談判着重之點、在保障奥國之獨立與中歐和平機構之組織、雙方對此種問題、意見大相懸殊、除在最後時問能加以改善而外、雙方意見之參差、恐無以消除之也、果爾、則外長賴伐爾原定於一月二日前赴羅馬、不得不暫告中止、以待繼談話至獲有把握、明知羅馬之行、必可成立功實恊定、然後始可成行、法方所建議者係締訂一種公約、其目的在維持奥國獨立、此在奥國對於各大國年予之保障、同所蘄望、但如繼承戰前奥匈帝國之諸新國、（卽捷克南斯拉夫等國）因贊成法國建議之故、會同予以保障、則奥國不願接受之、此外意大利對於法國上項計畫曾提出改正案、顯仍抱有修改和約之見解、自非法國及小恊商各國所能贊同、似此决大利目下所持見解、必須加以改善、而後賴伐爾始可欣然就道明矣、（卅一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>去年新運回顧</h3>
<p>新運總會發表</p>
<p>南昌通訊、中華民國二十三年、已經終了、在此一年史實中、新生活運動、實爲最珍貴之一頁、回顧本年運動之發起與進行、殊令人有無限之興奮與希望、爰將、年來運動概况、摘述如左、（一）新生活運動之發軔　每一民族之進化、如逆水行舟、不進則退、我中華民族有五千年之文化、有四萬之人民、有三千五萬方里之土地、在世界上本爲文明最古之民族、惟及近世、一誤於亡淸之昏庸不振、再閑於各帝國主義之壓迫蹂躝、民氣銷沉、國事日非、遂演成「頽唐」「浪漫」</p>
<p>等現象、暮氣日深、諸多退化、我中華民族之先覺孫中山先生、察知吾民族之危機、深以欲促政洽上再造國家、復興民族、倡導革命、已數十年、建立民國、亦二十餘載、不幸孫先生中道崩殂、而革命大業、至今仍未成功、其原因固由於各帝國主義者之加緊壓迫、使我不能抬頭、而吾民族之頽廢不振、未能同赴事功、抯當重任、要爲一最大原因、吾革命領袖蔣委員長、本攘外必先安内、革命必先革心之旨、於民國二十三年二月、在行營所在地之南昌、倡導新生活運動、謀我全體國民之生活革命、以最簡易而急切之方法、滌除我國民不合時代不適環境之習性、爲振衰起敝之圖、作復興吾民族之基本運動、新生活運動、爲一極平凡極質　的運動、不欲深文周納、更不願徒唱髙調、初期運動、僅致力於「規矩」「淸潔」兩項、</p>
<p>（二）新生活運動之初期進行　新生活運動、由蔣委員長之啓示、在南昌作初期之試騐、當初成立主持機關、名曰南昌新生活運動促進會、於二月下旬開首次幹事會議、各項規程、逐漸製訂、運動分三項進行、即先以宣傳、繼以指導、後以糾察、復開巿民大會、提燈大會、引起一般巿民之注意與認識、而「規矩」「淸潔」兩項運動、遂按照擬訂之計劃、逐步進行、</p>
<p>（三）全國各地之繼起　新生活運動在南昌施行後、於短促期間、收效頗宏、而「規矩」「淸潔」兩項、大異舊觀、全國各地、因企望民族復興之殷切、及去舊佈新之熱忱、均於蔣委員長領導之下、起作同樣之運動、首先繼起者爲首都、次爲上海、於是江蘇·河北·湖北·福建·安徽·河南·浙江·湖南·山東·山西·陜西·甘肅·察哈爾·綏遠·寗夏·靑海·四川·貴州·雲南·西康·及北平巿·此運動於短促時期、蓬勃發展、而及於通都大邑、邊遠鄕陬、實非初料所及、</p>

<h3>年來司法之回顧與前瞻</h3>
<p>説起這過去一年的司法狀况、實在是抱歉得很。雖然關於司法組織各事項多屬於司法行政範圍，當時並不隸於司法院，要之無論純粹司法與司法行政在過去一年間，尚遺留着許多缺憾於吾人胸臆中，這是無可諱言的。其所以致此之由，雖不一端，或緣國家多難，或因財政困難，亦有幾經奮鬥，力圖變革，而所憑藉者薄，一時尚未能臻於圓滿的理想之域者。然綜合此許多挫折條而舉之，作過去之檢查，爲將來之借鏡，也未嘗不是從事公務者自律之道。</p>
<p>目前司法現象，最使吾人感覺不安的，大約不三點：</p>
<p>（一）領事裁判權未撤消，致法權完整未能辦到。這是司法上第一個缺憾。本來民國十八年十二月二十八日國府已經下令宣布撤銷各國領事裁判權；二十年五月四日更公布管轄在華外</p>
<p>人實施條例十二條，定二十一年一月一日施行，當時似乎未嘗不欲雷厲風行，藉此打破不平等條約之束縛，而一雪八十年來之恥辱。嗣以九一八事變發生以後，財政困難，一切關於撤銷領事裁判權準備事項，均無力舉辦，至今爲之擱淺。今年水旱頻仍，政府救死扶傷未暇。所以撤廢領判，雖期望甚切，也不得不待之來年了。</p>
<p>（二）新式法院設立未普遍，致使司法獨立精神未能貫澈，這是司法上第二個缺憾。查十八年訓政時期司法工作六年計畫，原定首二年間應設縣法院一千三百六十七所，第三年後改爲地方法院，六年間應増設地方法院一千七百七十三所，増設髙等法院一所＝，髙等分院四十二所，最髙分院四所，少年監四十七所，普通監一百七十四所，累犯監廿二所，肺病及精审病監廿一所。這是本黨在訓政時期完成司法獨立之計畫。可是目前情形也很感到缺憾，大抵因爲國家財政困難、所以許多計畫不能按期舉辦。計至廿三年底止，現有縣法院三十七所（但十八年以後増設）地方法院一百二十九所（由十八年以後設立者五十六所）髙等法院二十四所（十八年後設立二所）髙等分院三十八所（十八年以後増設者九所）少年監一所，普通監九十二所，（十八年以後増設者十八所）比較原來計畫相差甚巨。不過這是屬於司法行政之事，在十月改隸以前，原不屬於司法院方面之職責　　（三）關於司半效能方面，雖年來力求達到「妥」「速」兩義，然尚不免有遺憾之處。最髙法院係鄙人直接指揮，力求「妥」「速」，自屬當然職責。計該院未結案件，二十一年爲五千五百十八起，二十二年爲五千一百九十一起，二十三年爲四千五百五十四起，年有漸趨减少之勢。吾人最終目的，自然是「案無留積」，然以目前之庭數與推事員額，恐已鞠躬盡瘁無可再進。前例最髙法院推事每人每月結案以十五件爲限度，現已増刑事爲每月十八件，民事每月二十件以上爲最少限度，以第三審案件卷帙之浩繁，每日結案逾一件以上，總不是荀且畏難者可比擬了。至於各級法院辦案情况，因本年度統計尚未就緖，難得確算。茲姑以蘇州髙等法院，江寗地方法院，上海地方法院，吳縣地方法院四處爲例（以其地位接近京都統計材料比較易得）下列甲表就各該法院第二審受理刑事案件數額與撤銷原判决案件數額爲比較，以見「妥」之程度達到幾許。乙表就各該院受理民事案件數率與未結案件數率比較，以見其「速」之程度：</p>

<p>右表除江寗地方法院歷年兩數比俱略爲「三與一」外，餘各法院大抵由「一與一」比進步至「三與一」比，此點可以推見各級法院辦案對於「妥」之一義已漸有進步。惟此差額仍甚巨。自應更求進步不懈。</p>

<p>江寗地方法院　二十年　二八○　　四八　　　　　　　廿一年　三七一　　五六　　　　　　　廿二年　四六三　　七二上海地方法院　二十年　九一二　　一三一　　　　　　　廿一年　一一四四　一四六　　　　　　　廿二年　一二九○　一三八</p>
<p>右表除江寗地方法院外，餘二院廿二年度較廿一年度受理件數均増加，而未結件數反减少，可見其辦案對於「速」之一義也有進步。惟此僅就一二大都巿言之，餘均未有統計可稽。而江寗地方法院以首都所在，反爲落後，自屬一大缺憾。</p>
<p>由上述數字，雖可表明一年來司法效能略有進步，然距吾人最後目的，自屬太遠。</p>
<p>此外過去一年間尚有一件可紀述之事，就是—最髙法院判例要旨之編輯。因爲我國法律偏缺不全，且法律規定亦時有不免發生疑義之處，故判例編輯於司法效能之增進尤屬重要。此篇計十五萬言，自十六年南京最髙法院成立始，至二十年十二月底止，凡判例可以闡明法律旨趣者爢不盡量搜輯。於今日百孔千瘡之司法現象中，得此一着，差足告慰。</p>
<p>過去的狀况大略説明了。現在進而表明吾人今後之希望。</p>
<p>對症下藥，自然第一件急務是要從速實行撤廢領事裁判權以實現法權之完整。此事一方固有賴於改良司法完成各項法典間塞外人之藉口以爲進行之基本步驟，而當實施之際，外交折衝亦屬重要。至完成法典又屬立法範圍，改良司法尤以財政充裕爲根基，故撤廢領判，必須外交財政司法立法各方面通力合作而後能成功。而吾人於今年間當力排萬難以赴此鵠的，當無疑義。</p>
<p>其次便是普遍設立新式法院肅淸以行政兼下司法之舊習。擬於最短期間督飭司法行政部通盤籌劃詳細規定實施辦法呈請中央核議施行，庶使六年　訓政不至徒託空言，而司法獨立，行將次第實現。</p>
<p>再其次關於増進司法效能方面，亦當督飭各級法院務以最大努力達到「妥」「速」之極軌。期於各法院受理件數將與已决案件差相合，而未决案件將退近於零。且使第三審勵行法律審制度，現在最髙法院所裁判之事件，依統計結果，大約原裁判被廢棄者爲百分之三十强。今年之期望要由這百分之三十强降至百分之十弱。這才可以顯出下級法院辦案之能「妥」。</p>
<p>要達到以上目的，大約有以下幾個方針。</p>
<p>（甲）擴充各法院，増加庭數。因爲近來各法院所受理案件日益増加，從整個政府方針説雖同時應採取種種社會政策以求充裕國民經濟從根本上减少犯罪與爭訟之緣因。然就司法本身方面説，則欲求辦案迅速，擴充各法院，實爲不可避免之事。</p>
<p>（乙）加緊法官之訓練，擴充法院，是從量的方面増加司法效能，同時對質的方面亦應注重，法官之訓練即所以増進法官之能力使其能充裕以達辦案「妥」「速」之原則。現在法官訓練所更加設承審員訓練班及書記官訓練班以爲之輔。法官能力増進則辦案「妥」「速」二義庶幾可以達到。</p>
<p>（丙）設立法曹研究會　法官訓練所只能以一定數之人員在一定時間集於一個塲合而研究。法曹研究會則可以通全國各地法官繼續而研究。其組織大概以最髙法院推事及檢察署檢察官爲基本會員。各省髙地兩院推檢亦可隨時加入爲會員，共同研究，務使全國一二三審法官皆可藉此交換知識。内部分民刑兩組，就本國外國法律條文及判例解釋並各省現有案件等由會員各提出問題相與釋疑辨論。如此則居終審地位者可週知全國一二審之經歷情形。居一二審地位者亦可藉識終審法院有其本來之規矩繩量，内外溝通，精神一貫，不特發還更審之案可以逐漸减少，即全國法官之才識智能亦皆可藉以増　。</p>
<p>（丁）召集全國司法會議　増進司法效能之方法，自然是多方面的。一人之思力有限，所以要集合全國法律實務家與法律學者相與悉心研討，才可以得到詳盡之方法。我們的計畫，如果没有别的故障，這司法會議將要於本年實現。</p>
<p>以上是區區微意，誠不免掛一漏萬。如果各界不吝指教，當然是樂於傾聽的。</p>

<h3>教費積欠十三個月常熟教界窘狀</h3>
<p>欠數不明一時淸理爲難</p>
<p>教員生活不安風潮迭起</p>
<p>（常熟通訊）本縣教育經費、積欠達十三個月、本年下學期教費、僅發至九月份、小學教員因生活困難、激起索薪風潮、已有三次、教育當局除奔走各大銀行、東移西借、勉强敷衍一時外、對於教網問題、已視爲絶大難關、益以本縣教界内部派别甚多、對於積欠教費事實、舉爲唯一攻擊之目標、教育當局如於教費如無統籌淸理之方法、際此年關將屆、轉瞬總結賑之際、教界前途糾紛、正未已也、茲將積欠教費情形、調查如下、</p>
<h3>積欠情形</h3>
<p>本縣教育經費、歷年以來、前後積欠十三個月、其總共敷額如何、一般教員校長均甚茫然、即負責之教育當局、亦不能有確切之數字答復、有謂歷年積欠達七十五萬元、但此項數額、係以歷年預算計數、其忙漕收入、均以額徴計之、並未以秋成分數核實剔除、與實徴數目不符、據教界一般估計、以每月教費一萬元至二萬元計算、歷年積欠當在二十幾萬元左右、但此項積欠、係自民國十一年起、經時十二年、其中各校有因主管人員更替而發淸者、有尚未發淸者、有借到半數或少數者、情形複雜、究竞此項欠數、係忙漕税捐項下、未曽徴起、或被移挪者、或另有其他原因者、教育當局更茫然不解、此誠爲空前未有之一筆糊塗賑也、</p>
<h3>教員生活</h3>
<p>至小學教員待遇、向係僅憑資格、分三級支俸、流弊極大、待遇不公、去歲經特殊視察後、就三級爲底薪、分别視成績優劣、予以増减、髙級小學正教員薪俸自二十二元至三十元、專科教員自十八元至二十六元、初級小學正教員自十八元至二十六元、兼任教員十二元至二十元、均分三級、每級二元、通常各校教員均支底薪、數額已屬極徴、且本年上半年、僅發一個月、下半年自七月至九月爲止、十月份起、分文無着、因之激起索薪風潮、前後凡三次、其中一次、教局長被　衆包圍、無法應付、在縣署當衆痛哭、另有一次、則從教局後門逃出重圍、平日雖奔走各大銀行、籍措借欵、無如教局借欵、大都展期、信用漸失、以致毫無結果、本年旱災以後、糧　忙漕徴收、難有起色、教員薪水、又奉廳令八折發放、收入减短、生活困難、需欵更急、教育當局視籌欵爲唯一難關、經濟旣無着落、事業遂告停頓、益以本縣教界派别極多、教育當局於教費之措置、旣無確切辦法、遂舉以爲攻擊之目標、值此年關將屆、轉瞬結賑之期、教費不能發濟、教界前途、糾紛正未已也、</p>
<h3>積欠魇因</h3>
<p>歷年積欠教費旣無確數、又乏辦法、究竟積欠之原因何在、實爲當前急待解决之問題、據記者多方調查、始悉歷年積欠原因、不外下之數項、（一）歷年教費預算收入、皆照田賦額徴數目編造、不以秋成分數核實緊縮、以致形成虚收實支、支出隨之増大、實際最近五年税收、平均不足五成、是以收數不能相抵、即如本年度預算、仍以額徴三七二二七四元、列入收數、又犯此病、（二）歷年教局對於經濟部分、缺少監督、以致前收租處主任華兆増從中舞弊、侵蝕公欵一萬六千餘元、事後被其逃亡、數年未獲、現本案已由錫法院判决、民事部分、僅移轉其所有田產三十九畝二分六毫、損失之巨、可見一斑、（三）教局學田散處四鄕、相延已久、未經調查整理、以致界址不明、何人承種、舊荒有未成熟、新荒如何、當局完全無、（四）屠宰附税預算、年收七千五百餘元、自二十年九月至現時爲止、爲包商金濟　拖欠七千零二十七元、朱德善欠繳四千五百七十五元、教育當局對之、亦放任不追、（本報函授生兪炳宸通訊）</p>

<h3>工部局考慮學費問題</h3>
<p>一家數生入學應否照舊减費</p>
<p>工部局教育委員會、近對於一家有學生數名、同在局立學校、應否仍照舊章减折收受學費、予以詳細考慮、據財務處長提出報告、向章除小學外、一家兩生入學生、八折收費、三生者七折收費、四生以上者减收三分之一、每年此項减費額、約達六萬二千五百元、局方向來原則、教育費大部仍賴捐税支付、故對少數人徒因其兒童衆多、即予以特别利益、似有問題、且受者未必需此、又此項辦法、在中國學界中並無其例、而局立中學内、一家有一生以上入校者、大抵係出於頗爲富有这家、未必有經濟的困難、</p>
<p>因上述理由、財務處建議、自春季起、在各華童中學内、取消减費之辦法、如此可増加學費約二萬二千元、此欵可用以擴廣教育、如増設奬學金之類、較爲適當、</p>
<p>至於外童學校情形略異、財務處長主張、將一家兩生者改爲九折、三生者八五折、四生以上者八折如此可増收學費一萬七千元、亦可以充奬金及補助金之用、</p>
<p>旋經討論之下、或云减費辦法、他處並無此例、且因學生之是否來自一家、頗有難定、故不便於旋行、某委員則主張、華人女子中學仍照舊章、以示提倡女學、其華童男中學、則照外童學校之</p>
<p>例、另一委員則云、局立華童學校之學生家長、尤其是女生家長、率多富有之人、局方旣已担負三分之二教育費、則家長自應付足其三分之一、且局立華校之設備、與外間比較爲優、而局立外童學校之設備、則與他處比較爲遜、學費數則較巨、　　討論結果、委員長建議、將减費辦法一律取消、而於特殊情形者、則加以救濟、此議教育處長認爲可行、但恐家長方面不願人調查其經濟狀况、家長亦未盡富有、故取消减費、不免有感痛苦者、渠意可以増設奬學金、或並擴充免費學額云委員會對此問題、結果未有决定、容俟改期再議</p>

<h3>洋拆微鬆收解甚繁</h3>
<p>本年各業巿氣不佳、欵項流動困難、對於昨日大除夕之總結束期、歸納淸償者寥寥、而遷延姑息者大有其人、卒至結束更感窘苦、惟收解手續無論如何勢必繁多、昨日之外灘銀行及華商各銀行與錢莊公司互相收解、厥數甚偉、巿塲中洋拆早午兩巿同開五角五分、與前日巿價略小五分、形勢仍挺、惟劃頭加水以有銀行押欵做出、故爾回小、初爲五角五分、及六角、最後由二角八分逐减至二角收盤、小總會中祇做一角四五分、拆票交易、昨日早巿轉帪一百七十餘萬、新交易三十餘萬、午巿交易八十餘萬、小總會中交易六十餘萬、均爲三天後還拆、蓋元旦及二日爲封關之期、故須有三天之期、與平時一天還拆不同也、洋押欵交易、華商銀行及錢莊做出新交易五百二十餘萬、外商銀行做出四百餘萬、取購額六百八十餘萬、鈔票收回及發出一百六七十萬、來源去胃均停、銀行收解、緣大年底收解孔多一時無從核計、大約不下數千萬進出、錢莊洋公單收解亦甚多、計有七八千萬之巨、洋劃頭欵收解亦有二千餘萬、各路匯欵六七十萬、收解現欵未有確實統計、大致亦有一百餘萬解出云、</p>

<p>昨日錢業公會常會、對於存息議案、僉以十二月份洋拆甚昂、最髙到過六角、最低亦有二角餘、如是全日統計有十元零二角四分之巨、因而對於存息盤勢必隨之抬髙、結果開出爲九元五角九五扣、較諸平時之二元九五扣、大有霄壤之别矣、如是欠息最髙價則須在十五元之譜耳、</p>

<h3>糧食新年已到米巿停兩天</h3>

<p>（滬北）昨日河下各帮至船念六七號、巿上各貨去胃因陽歷年底、買方上巿寥寥、客方無意脱售、致各色去胃平淡、巿形白粳及各尖變陰元早薄稻等貨價形均無甚上落、</p>
<h3>芝蔴洋莊開九元八</h3>
<p>歲底雜糧交易寥落</p>
<p>昨雜糧巿、因屆歲底、明年休巿二天、（一二日交易寥寥、黃豆祗大德新油廠辦去歸德豆二千包、價開三元六角一分半、比較前週之價跌三分半、漢口乍豆本街去三百包、價開三元四角及二角八、刻下豆巿前途、因皖免捐在醖釀中、趨勢須看開巿後、芝蔴前日（星期日）由沙遜洋行採去三百噸、價開九元八角、爲勢尚屬俏俐、現下貨户抛價喊十元、午後聞怡和洋行曽有電報發出、照此價或能成交、成交數勢必可觀、現貨東洋帮採去蚌埠蔴二百十二包、價開六元六角、九江奶蔴六十包、價爲六元七角七分、行情亦漲四五分、</p>

<h3>五金馬口鐵本重難廉售</h3>
<p>馬口鐵巿面因定價飛漲、外匯又貴、成本加昂、各同業因血本關係、相率不肯廉售、况在年内銀根緊迫期中、放帳不易、是以均不願意出讓、大都皆預備明春再售、所以出貨甚少、茲將各種花色巿况分誌於後、</p>
<p>英貨　斷檔已久、巿頗岑寂、雖同業對於遠期定貨、尚有購定、但遠水難救近火、致申巿仍無消息可報告也、</p>
<p>美貨　蛋廠帮交易不甚發展、所以出路鋭减、雖印刷廠俱有點綴、惟爲數甚少、是以行情方面、尚能站住而不跌、如九十磅單連估十六元五角、雙連三十二元七角半、一百磅單連十七元二角半、雙連三十五元、聞連日祇有數十箱買賣、而大宗交易則仍無所聞、惟新貨成本甚髙、故同業均不肯賤售云、</p>
<p>意貨　此貨巿上所流行者、祇有雙連計估三十一元、而放賑行情則要三十一元五角、交易製罐廠印鐵廠買賣獨好、而玩具公司等成产交亦廣、此外客帮則祇有問津而已　　德貨　交易頗好、面到貨不廣、是以執貨者頗有居奇心思、其價如九十磅單連估十六元、一百磅十六元五角、雙連一百磅估三十三元、九十磅估三十一元五角、聞連日祇有少數開出、</p>
<p>法貨　其貨交易頗好、惟性硬、致對於考究之印花及製罐等頗不合算、故其成交、祇限於粗低之物品而已、現巿售十五元五角（九十磅）及十六元（一百磅）、雙連無貨、是以無巿可報告也、</p>

<h3>元旦試筆</h3>
<p>— 周瘦鵑</p>
<p>哎喲喲，又是一年了！今天這一天，據説是元旦，理合道賀，這呌做「賀年」，然而人們中賀年，我卻要弔年！</p>
<p>或人説：新年新歲，萬象更新，應當賀賀的，爲甚麽要弔呢？這未免太殺風景吧。</p>
<p>我説：賀無可賀，弔郤可弔。以我個人來説，年齡一年年的増加，朝氣一年年的减退：人事日繁，擔負日重，出路日少，去死日近；加之不如意事常八九，可與人言無二三，牢悉滿腹，獨自前熬；以這般的環境，度這般的歲月，卽使新年來臨，還有甚麽可賀，徒覺其可弔而已。以社會來説：那麽災禍一年年的蔓延，民生一年年的凋敞，盜賊一年年的横行，秩序一年年的紊亂；加之世途崎嶇，人心險惡，新道德尚未樹立，舊道德早已破產；雖是高唱着改良社會，而社會之不改良也如故，卽使新年來臨，還有甚麽可賀，徒覺其可弔而已。以國家來説：那麽國土一年年的縮小，國庫一年年的空虚，内政一年年的未見修明，外交一年年的無法應付、國際上的地位，一年年的降落下去，以這般的國家，處這般的世界，卽使新年來臨，還有甚麽可賀，徒覺其可弔而已。</p>
<p>唉！王小二過年，一年不如一年，任是强爲歡笑，跟着大家賀年，也有甚麽意味，何况世界第二次大戰，行將爆發，來日大難，不知所屆。這二十四年元旦的來臨，彷彿是釋迦作大獅子吼，在冥冥中警告我們，説：『這是世界大動亂的前夜，千年古國，隨時有没落的可能，而奮發圖强，也在此一舉，你們已凖備了没有？』</p>
<p>已凖備了没有？誰也不能提出一個答案來。拔劍斫地，地旣默然，掻首問天，天亦無語。</p>
<h3>廿四年小預言</h3>
<p>— 放庵</p>
<p>時光迅速，一年告終，幾項舊賑，且付東風！一些預言，但願幸中。元旦試筆，聊代書紅。</p>
<p>冬不嚴寒，雨雪調匀，路無凍死骨蓋朱門酒肉臭而移贈災民也。河冰堅凍，且得凍死田裏螟虫卵子。春夏之交，蠶絲收成大豐，價奇昂，杭綢京緞湖縐，每尺自數角突増至三元以上。農民小有益。七月，疫癘不行，飲冰室老闆大發其財。秋收，田中多結雙穗，有田人笑得眼睛縫。</p>
<p>五全代表大會，開幕於首都，各方精誠團結。要人發表團結宣言，從此選爲各學校課本，千秋不朽。</p>
<p>記者得中航空劵頭奬，建廣厦千萬間，庇天下士。</p>
<p>天竺香巿更熱鬧，各省名勝，所發現者凡數十處，遊人大廣眼界。有人探湖上紫來洞，發現竟可通達徽州，從此至皖可抄捷徑。</p>
<p>颶風季中，上海三十三層之大厦無恙。</p>
<p>國人狂歡於朝野，安安穏穏過一九三六年底新年。</p>
<h3>元旦談片</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>元旦爲一歲之始，雖在國仇家難，風雨飄搖之中；亦必破涕展眉，騰歡作樂，以盡粉飾點綴之能事。蓋人人有希望心，深冀諸事之發端順遂也。然年年之希望如此，年年之結果又如彼，徒見其痴心夢想耳。</p>
<p>歐西風俗，元旦必啖吐綬雞。吐綬雞以燦如錦綬得名，又稱火雞。西人進庖丁，必詺其能否煮火雞，以爲技能優劣之標凖。</p>
<p>扶桑婦女於元日梳髮，名之曰初髮。瑟公有詩詠之云：萬千天女鬥華髮，掌上新雲幻月環，兀是鏡邊忙不了，懊儂若妹泥梳髮。又元日至二日間之夢曰初夢。初夢之夕，購七福神之寳船圖藉於枕底，以祈吉夢，瑟公亦有詩云：紅　濕壓寳船圖，七幅神帆水彩符，睡起掠髮先一笑，叩郎初夢見儂無。</p>
<p>畫鍾馗爲端午故事，不知最初却於元旦舉行之，遯齊閒覽云：今人歲首畫鍾馗辟邪，俗傳起於唐明皇時，七修類稿亦載沈明德元旦詞有云：新裱鍾馗先掛了，大紅春帖銷金好。又道書稱元旦曰天中節，亦與端午同。</p>
<p>元旦飲屠蘇酒，舊例也，且飲時必先年少者，故顧况詩有手把屠蘇讓少年之句。實則屠蘇草名，屋畫此草，因以名屋。昔人居屠蘇屋以釀酒，因稱屠蘇酒，謂飲之可以辟不正之氣，據父老相傳當滿淸入關，肆其淫戮，我蘇人士，有鑒於揚州嘉定之慘酷，元旦相率廢除屠蘇酒不飲，蓋以屠字不祥，深恐禍及生靈也，亦可憫已。</p>
<h3>莫輕放過了元旦</h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>今天是民國二十四年的元旦了。一年之計在於春。一年的偉大事業的着手，自然也該是從元旦日開始的，所以我們便該不能輕輕地放過元旦。</p>
<p>在去年一年中，我們中國是整年的掉在一切水旱的天災，匪亂的人禍，飛機兵艦的外侮的侵襲，經濟侵略的嚴重的壓迫，各種環境之下所產生的恐怖的氛圍裏，幾乎没曽暢暢地呼過一口氣。但是這不幸的二十三年，已隨着光陰的消逝而過去了。光明的二十四年的元旦，已衝破了漫漫的長夜，降臨到了我們的面前了。自然，我們所希望的，是二十四年的光明與幸運，也跟着元旦，衝破了可怖的二十三年的氛圍，而降臨在我們的面前。</p>
<p>但是光明與幸運，是需要着人們去努力追求的。光明與幸運，不是像元旦那麽的會得自然降臨的。這一點是該認識淸楚的。二十三年的所以會掉在那麽濃厚的可怖的氛圍裏，也並不是像二十三年的没落那麽自然掉下去的，原因是爲了方向的錯誤。躺在我們面前的，不拘是一件甚麽事，總是二條路：一一一條是成功的，一條是失敗的。二十三年便是誤走上了失敗的那一條路。但是今年我們該走怎一條路呢。</p>
<p>今天是元旦。今天是這一年中的偉大事業的開始的日子。在今天，我們自然希望今年一年中，是充滿着光明，充滿着幸運。光明與幸運，是滿佈在躺在我們面前的那條成功之路上的。只須我們能在這一年中的偉大事業的開始時，認淸楚我們的方向，認淸楚我們的第一步，究竟中該踏上怎一條路，一一依着去年的方向，還是走那一條失敗之路呢，還是換一個方向，走成功之路？</p>
<p>今天是民國二十年的元旦，我們該怎麽地重視，而不使輕輕地溜過去呀！</p>
<h3>王小二的懺悔</h3>
<p>— 亮</p>
<p>東也「劈拍」，西也「劈拍」，娘兒們穿得紅紅綠綠的，怪惹景。男兒漢亦扮得挺漂亮，臉上浮着一股笑勁兒，汽車，人力車，揑着刺耳的喇叭，呼　着，大街上眞比往常熱鬧，新年啦。一夥孩子瘋了似地打胡同裏竄出來，「嘩啦嘩啦……」不知他們没結完的叫的那一道？「劈拍劈拍」，扔着金錢砲。</p>
<p>王小二可没有這副興緻，那麽一張死灰臉，不滿半寸的烟蒂兒仍貼在紫色的嘴唇皮上，手裏提着一點刀口肉，「過年啦」他心兒裏想，瞧人家歡天喜地的吃酒席，我樂兒，自己可老是鬧着窮，没安逸日子過，「當眞有命運八字嗎？」他時常這樣氣憤憤地問着自己。他縮在街沿石上走着，走着，那麽慢的，像蝸牛爬，可是猛刺裏「劈拍」，一個金錢砲在他腦杓上爆開�，吃了一驚。掉過脖子，「哈哈哈哈…」一夥孩子竄進胡同去了。</p>
<p>「媽的，小鬼都想欺我王小二了，人就不能窮。」駡了幾句，没一個對他表同情的，别人也「哈哈哈」地笑着跑開啦，他想這勢口「狗眼看人低」，一氣，連眼睛都氣花了。跌跌衝衝的跑到家裏，蹩進破牆門，也没理睬誰，往舗上一倒。</p>
<p>便想前想後地想：「什麽是命運？什麽是八字？都是没出息的話。從前我王小二不是過的好日子嗎！大家庭，偏偏弟兄要鬧着分家，不和睦，你搶我奪。可便宜了外邊人和鄰舍，偷一些，搶一些，那時只知道自夥兒跟自夥兒爭，别人來逞火打刦可全不在乎。打官司，一年不料二年……拖延着，一點業可完啦，還説什麽掙氣不掙財呢，手足同胞……想想，心痛……」王小二淌眼涙了，他反悔過去的不是，他决意要和哥哥弟弟重行和好，合夥兒幹起來　　就在這新年的晚上，王二嫂子把刀口肉煮了一大花碗，還有兩塊鹹魚，王小二打了一斤白干兒，跟老大，小三，小四喝着，吃着，他們都把宿寃扔了，説着眞心話？説得髙興的時候，便「鬨！」的笑開啦。</p>
<h3>日曆……末一張</h3>
<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>唉！日子，眞過得快啊！一年三百六十五天，忽忽已到了末一日了；回想已往的光陰，郤像流水般一去不復回。前人説：『棄我去者，昨日之日不可留，亂我心者，今日之日多煩憂』。念了這幾句老話。不由得想到爲什麽歲月催人，怎樣的速？一個渾圓的地球，不斷的飛繞太陽，從來没有人使地南北的軸兒，停頓不動；所以人生的經過，就跟着一秒一分一刻的時間，刹那刹那的過去，像轉瞬差不多，一年又到了末的一日了。</p>
<p>吾就拿民國二十三年的日曆一看，那懸掛在壁間，起初不是很厚的麽？不料今天撕去了一張，明天又撕去了一張，到了眼前，是十二月卅一號了。心裏一想，這一張倘再撕去，下面有没有那頭呢！這是大家明白二十三年的日子盡了。但這日曆的末一張，究竟撕去的好，還是賸留起來的好，倒有些頗費斟酌一下。因爲這一張，雖是撕去，尚有明年的日曆來補下去，然而『年非昔日之年，日非去年之日』，安得而不兩眼直視壁間，留戀着不忍把他撕去，立起來反鄭重地擇了一處間空的地位，重新懸掛着，上面又題了幾個字：『你二十三年日曆，予吾們以有爲的光陰，可是不少，無奈人們終不肯愛惜，也不斷地唐喪，那末：就像一去如梭的錯過了。這不是日曆的負人，實在還是人負日曆，所以我對你慚愧的萬分，怎麽能硬起手來把你再撕去呢』？</p>

<p>時代的巨輪，不住地向前推進，民國二十四年的元旦日又到了。不管國際風雲正在片樣劇變，腹地農村日加瀕於友產，社會上崇尚禮貌的人們；逢到新年，總要彼此恭賀一下。於是桃紅色及玫瑰紫色的賀年片，就成捆成紥的在綠衣郵差手中挨門逐户的亂塞。提到賀年片，數年以前，某報附刊中，曽載有武進某君，搜集賀年片百餘種，假當地民教館公開展覽一次，五色繽紛，倒也是一種奇觀。近年以來，我曽在朋友家，看見有人寄與他幾種賀年片上加印有精誠團結努力救國的字樣，説他是標奇立異吧，未免有點喪良心。因爲友朋間通信，本是情感的作用，那麽賀年片上，又何妨以杜工部憂時憂國的熱忱，向友朋間流露一下呢。</p>
<p>今年的賀年片，尚未有多種寓目，但是我懸想，必定會還有比較更加合時的賀年片發現，因爲中華民族的特性，向來是能順應環境的啊。</p>
<h3>是　會</h3>
<p>— 亞光</p>
<h3>猪作</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>對於猪年的感想</p>
<p>古語有云，「鳥之將死，其鳴也哀，人之將死，其言也善，」蠢賤的猪，平時飽食貪眠，無所用心，一旦臨刑，也會悲鳴起來！</p>
<p>在我約莫十四五歲的時候吧！某天淸晨，挾了書包上學，道經猪作，見到一個猙獰其貌的屠夫，握着雪亮的尖刀，瞄凖那弔在樑木下的一頭猪白尖子進去，紅尖子出來，鳴聲慘厲！血在不住的流！我當時默想：大腹便便，優遊終日的下賤動物！也有到了末日的一天！却並不感覺中國前途是怎樣？自從九一八，一二八的砲聲相繼發動，纔覺悟敵人是拿我們當猪仔了！毫不客氣，一刀一刀地在宰割，國人呢，還在醉生夢死，到現在連像猪樣的鳴聲慘厲，也一些聽不見了！</p>
<p>光陰很快！百孔千瘡的中華民國又到二十四歲了！元旦逢着猪年，不是凉血動物的話，誰都要寒心！誰都要驚覺！無謂的傾禱，還不是大家起來，作掙扎民族生命的自衛運動！努力最後的凖備！應付將近來到的大難！我所自勉勉人的，如此而已。</p>
<h3>民國廿四年元旦—希望國運轉變</h3>
<p>— 黄寄萍</p>
<p>元旦書紅，萬事亨通！這句古老話，是深深地印在一般人的腦子裏，故無論新舊社會，在元旦那天，總有許多学迷信，人們相見，開口便説幾句『吉利話』。我們當記者的，每逢元旦，必有特刊，發表幾篇普天同慶的文章，預祝國運昌明，民生福利。但一年易過，又是新年，要如把這番話來與事實對照一下，簡直都是騙人，自己也覺得慚愧！所以今後的元旦，再也不敢説大話，存奢望了。</p>
<p>在悲觀的人，翻開廿四年新日曆第一頁的時候，也許驚心吊膽，怎知今年的國運如何轉變？民生如何苦樂？兼之世界風雲險惡，大戰難免爆發，瞻望前途，凶多吉少！在樂觀的人，明知大難當前，末日不遠，然如人人存此心理，終必一事無成，與其坐視太息，莫如奮袂起行。我堂堂中華，在過去廿三年中支離破碎的局面，誠然不堪回首，難道國運就此一蹶不振了麽？不，决不！我相信廿四年後的國運，便有轉變的希望。你瞧！中央及各省的領袖，都有奮發有爲的朝氣，埋頭苦幹的精神，各方領袖，已有實行大團結的趨勢，聖賢所謂『先王之道，和爲貴。』眞能大澈大悟，和衷共濟，便是國運轉變的朕兆。至於各省推進教育，實業，交通，水利，墾殖，及恢復固有道德的新生活運動，都在發揚光大，這不是顯明的例證麽？</p>
<p>全國人民，旣受盡了過去的患難，心灰無用，悲怒無用，怨天恨地更無用；今而後。惟有認淸目標，力自振拔，解决自身的問題，並爲社會國家效勞，上下一致，復興中華。明儒呂新吾先生説：『人生始而窮，繼而悔奮，乃由悔奮而習勤苦，因勤苦而知節儉，由節儉而能積儲，自積儲而漸至於富。富足之後，卽生驕滿，習豪奢，恣淫暴，必至招禍變，而仍歸困窮。』現在我中華民族的處的境遇，正是困窮之後，必須悔奮而勤苦，合四萬萬五千萬人的力量，使國運轉變過來！</p>
<h3>新年獻詞　閻重樓</h3>
<p>人生應該在不斷的活動中去取得新的經騐；人生應該在輪轉的時序中去創造新的生命。</p>
<p>現在，一九三四年已經去逝，一九三五年又降臨在我們的眼前了；這新年給我們带來的是一種新的景象，是一種新的興奮。</p>
<p>你看！春風不是在和煦的吹送着嗎？萌芽不是在開始滋生着嗎？小鳥不是在枝頭快樂的鳴唱着嗎？……雖然過去我們是受過不少的磨折，嘗過不少的苦冯痛，……但是現在這新的時序，却給我們増添了新的希望；醫愈了我們心上舊的傷痕。</p>
<p>時代的輪子進展，人生的價值増髙，我們要認淸新年的意義，努力新生的創造，邁步向新的大路上前進。</p>
<p>「願全世界變成新世界；願全人類變成新人類。」我就拿這兩句話，來做新年的獻詞吧。</p>
<h3>西太后特准带眼鏡的勛齡先生口中之隆裕和瑾妃「御香縹緲錄」外集</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>在拙譯御香縹緲錄的「介紹原著者」的一章裏，以及正文的中間，勛齡先生的大名已見過好幾次了，讀者對於他大概不致十分生疏吧！最近，不侫又因老友唐雲帆兄的介紹，得以當面和他相見，並且還談了許多的話。因此知道他本人是留法的工科學生，曽在淸宫中當過電廠監督，閒來常給慈禧拍照。他的眼睛患近視，狠早就带眼鏡，回國後初次朝見太后，太后就問：「勛齡，你的眼睛不是有毛病嗎」？他答：「是的，是近視眼」！太后又問：「你带不带眼鏡」？答：「带的」！太后便説：「那末你带上了吧」！這樣一來，他的带眼鏡就算是特别恩准的了！每逢朝觐，也不再除下；所以御香縹緲錄中德齡形容他的眼鏡的一段，全是眞的！</p>
<p>勛齡先生又告訴我幾段關於光緖的妻子隆裕，妾—瑾妃的軼事，非常有趣，特趁元旦日寫出來讓讀者笑笑。</p>
<p>（一）隆裕患口臭　依我們的想像，一個皇后總該是非常美麗的，但隆裕長提實在狠平常，而且患着狠厲害的口臭病，因此伊不得不時常吸紙烟，想借此掩過一些。不過伊還是不能十分的識相，往往歡喜把吸剩的烟尾賞給出入宮禁的命婦，公主，郡主，或宮女們吸，受的人又不便推却，只得竭力忍受着，或是趕快去漱口，或是凑伊不見的時候，馬一丢掉。</p>
<p>（二）瑾妃綽號金漆馬桶　依我們的想像，皇帝的妃子總該是一個千嬌百媢的美人了，但瑾妃恰好是顚倒剮過來，醜得不可形容，身材是又矮又胖，宮中人私下給伊起一個綽號，呌做金漆馬桶，可謂缺德！然而光緖對伊，的確還不錯，那是純粹因爲伊的同胞姊妹珍妃的關係。珍妃，據説確不一個狠美麗的女人，可惜死得太早了！</p>

<h3>發刊詞</h3>
<p>— 林康侯</p>
<p>浩浩太平洋，　濤猛奔逐，今日是何時。鮫　爭大陸，——大陸者云何，曰中華民族。——是以明眼人，努力事教育，——教育原理中，實列許多目：先珂愛其愛，子興樂其樂。……</p>
<p>我中華民族，人口四萬萬，而四萬萬中，女子佔其半，惜乎三季後，相習成風尚，終身閉幽　冰見生人面，鳴呼女子身，甘爲男子玩，男女重輕間，從茲劃然判！</p>
<p>先民有警言：「無才便是德班氏作女誡，周公作内則，女子模軌儀，一一詳論列，入唯事箕箒，出必盛容飾；……宋儒誠多事，關心到失節，從此女子身，不復有天日！</p>
<p>有淸當末造，門户盡然開，西方平等果，投我中華來。洎乎入民國，氣像何雄哉，通都大邑間，女學森森排，迎頭雖未能，急起思直追，女學當此時，五色揚厅輝。</p>
<p>我校剏設來，今才四年耳，慘澹幾經營，乃得差强意。然而成事難，知難庶幾矣，上下必一心，内外必一體，果能出懇勤，果能守綱紀，如斯而不成，抉我雙眸子。</p>
<p>凡爲女學生，首要在修養：平居須靜閑，臨事戒流蕩。求學誠宜勤。絶其徼幸想，毋持蹄與孟，而祝禾穰穰；服飾尤宜樸，取其可　障。毋塗粉與脂，而作嬌模樣。</p>
<p>我校當草剏，時期類過渡，昔臨文潮街，今徙斜橋路，在昔剏設時，學生僅百數，而今已可觀，加増倍什伍。多承社會人，百口百交譽，爲謀永逸計，今後思建樹。——今後思建樹建樹將何如，滬南淸幽處，購地百畝餘，將來關爲校，務求大規模，廣場必逿逿，夏屋須渠渠，有室供實驗，有館置圖書……今茲雖未能。指日展　謀，我忝列班行，此貴難旁逋，姑題數行墨，表我心區區。</p>
<h3>上海女子中學校四週紀念德藝兼修</h3>
<p>— 林森題</p>
<h3>談談女子本位的教育</h3>
<p>— 歐元懷</p>
<p>上海女子中學定於二十四年元旦舉行校慶紀念，來函微文，藉厲慶祝。我因該校成立僅滿四載，由主持校務者苦心孤詣，慘澹經營。今已成爲滬上的一個很有成績的教育機關。用特稍　愚見，期與國人一商欀女教問題。</p>
<p>我國從前一般社會上對於女子素有一種不台理的見解，所謂女子無才便是德，所謂三從四德，這種重男輕女的思想，束縛了中國婦女幾千年。所以男女平等的運動，是爲我國適應時代性的必然潮流。惟欲達到男女平等地位，自不能不先事捉髙婦女的智識，女子教育於以興盛起來了。</p>
<p>不過我國自倡辦女子教育以來，已經有三四十年的歷史，在這一種新的運動的潮流過程中一方面固有不少的進步，同時也發現了很多的錯誤。各級女子學校，往往祇泥於男女教育平等的原則，而昧於男女生理與需要的不同徒側重於社會人的培植，而忽視家庭人的養成。結果流弊所及，造成許多新式女子祇知消費，不屑勞作，進不能爲社會服務，退又不能管理家政，其影響家庭組織的崩潰，國家社會的危機，或有不勝蓋言者。</p>
<p>居茲二十世紀的社會，男女平等固爲世人所公認，教育機會均等也爲憲法所規定。伹是所謂男女平等，不是説男子做什麽事，女子一定也要做什麽事。至於男女教育機會均等，乃指在法令上受教育的機會均等，而在教育設施的内容上，仍應有適應特性的不同。換句話説，就是女子應有女子的教育，也卽所謂女子本位教育。這種教育的新動向必須能够發展女子本身的女性，女子共有的母性。人類共有的人性，在家庭上要做賢良的主婦，在社會上要做生產的份子，在國家上要做健全的公民。</p>
<p>基上所述，則今後女子學校的設施，無論在課程方面，教材方面，設備方面，訓練方面，均不宜完全施以「男性化」的教育，應特殊顧及女子生理上心理上及社會上的種種情形，必須注重於家庭經濟，幼兒保育，兒童教育，衛生原理與實際，及性教育的指導等，藉以保持其天賦的才能，精神的特質，和特殊的興趣與感情，而能養成一種新時代的獨立自覺的女子，外可以服務社會，内可以維繫家庭，則我人固引爲欣幸。而國家前途，實利賴之。</p>
<h3>為四年來之上海女中題克端女範</h3>
<p>— 蔣中正</p>
<h3>本校之過去</h3>
<p>— 吳志騫</p>
<p>教育爲立國之本，民族之盛衰國家之强弱，𢗝視其文化爲轉移。歐美諸國，學術精進，科學倡明，雄視宇内，蔚爲富强，論者莫不歸功於教育之普及。我國積弱已久，國勢衰微，振興圖强，端賴於教育之發達與夫國民經濟之建設。而國家之改造。又以民智爲轉移。我國人口四萬萬，婦女佔其半，是故女子之教育問題，職業問題，實有設法解决之必要。余之創設上海女子中學，實緣此也。</p>
<p>民國二十年春，余糾集同志，籌募經費，旋租凭賃西門文廟路學西街十九號爲校舍，聘請林康侯禇民誼吳鐵城吳醒亞陶百川諸先生爲校　，一月二十二日登報招生，二月九日舉行第一次入學試驗，十四日正式上課，至是吾校遂正式與社會人士相見矣。</p>
<p>二十年秋，來學者激増，原有校舍，不敷應用，乃租賃夢花街佳廬爲校外宿舍，將原有校舍，完全闢爲教室。至於學科，則分設髙中，初中，幼稚師範及成人補習班四部。　思校基已具，從茲必可順利進行，不憶開課未久，而「九一八」之難作，惡秏傳來，舉國　憤，本校師生抱「讀書不忘救國，救國不忘讀書」之旨，起而組織抗日會，爲全　學校倡；並組織宣傳隊，分赴蘇錫等處宣傳，喚起民衆，共赴國難，迴顧此學期中。全校師生之心靈，全爲抗日救國之工作所占據矣。</p>
<p>二十一年　本校正擬忍痛上課，而「一二八」淞滬之變又作。於是學生星敝，本校所受之影響，固品大也。是年秋，受戰事影響將髙中部暫行停辦；増設簡易師範科及華英打字科，以應社會需求。</p>
<p>二十二年春季開學之後，校務發達，原有校舍，獗隘不堪乃租賃斜橋製造局路大厦兩宅爲校舍，此亦卽今日之本校校舍也。是年秋恢復髙中部，分普通職業兩科；並租借湖南會館　爲運動場。迨至本年以來，校基　臻鞏固，現在總計有髙初中職業科師範科打字科，補習科與附設之大陸，大光，振華，天華等小學，幼稚園，學生共八百餘，教職員五十餘人，</p>
<p>本校創辦迄今，雖僅四載，而校基已具，探本索源，雖可云本校同仁之努力，要亦謬承社會人士之扶翼匡助有以致之也。此後當一本初旨，繼續努力，尚望國人起而教之！</p>

<h3>本校之將來</h3>
<p>— 鄭鐵堅</p>
<p>本校誕生，於茲四載，苦心籌劃，慘淡經營，迄於今日，規模已粗具矣。迴溯過去，以極有限之財力，及短促之時間，其能得有今日之結果者，始未非吳先生努力之所致。而默察現况，校務之發展已千萬倍於往日，然同人雅不願以爲自滿，仍當一本素志。繼續努力。，此可掬誠奉告於社會仕女者。當茲四週紀念之辰，謹將本校今後之設施，分述如下：</p>
<p>一物質的建設</p>
<p>物質建設，非具有充分之金錢不可。經濟已裕，則廣大之校舍，寛敞之校園，運動場，教室，圖書館，科學實驗室，均得次第完成，本校爲實現計劃中之上海女中起見，特於本年夏間在漕河涇購置基地，以爲建造新校舍之用；一方組織校務發展委員會，籌募鉅額經費，實行五年計劃，本校以後之一切設施，莫不依此計劃，努力進行，以實現良好之教育環境也。</p>
<p>二非物質的建設</p>
<p>優良之學校，質與量必須平均發展，量不過是學校之形式，質乃學校之精神。本校今後之設施，此兩者必求其均衡。所謂非物質之建設，有如下數種。</p>
<p>（一）教師　聘請人格髙尚，學識能力超越之教師，擔任各科課程，教導學生。</p>
<p>（二）課程　除注重國英算三種工具之課程外，他如自然科學，社會科學，衛生，藝術諸科，亦力求其充實完備。</p>
<p>（三）學生的訓練：</p>
<p>（一）健康的體格　廣設運動場，提倡正當娛樂，注意起居飮食，鍛鍊其身體，養成堅苦耐勞，精神飽滿，身心强健之國民。</p>
<p>（二）進取的精神　改變學生萎靡消極之人生觀而爲積極勇敢，富於進取之精神，不但須具有不當爲惡之操守，還須具有能爲善的智力，而後始能負起改造社會之重責。</p>
<p>（三）科學的能力　養成科學之頭腦，處事待人，須抱科學之態度，有條不紊，増進工作效能，鼓勵學生研究科學，作科學上之探討與發明。</p>
<p>以上爲本校今後設施之根本方針，此種工作，明知其艱鉅困難，然「有志者事竟成」同人謹以百折不撓之精神，努力邁進。以求其實現也。</p>

<h3>元旦</h3>
<p>— 向隅</p>
<p>過去一年的「衣裳的邊緣」，還留在我們的眼中。</p>
<p>我們深長地嘆了一口安慰的氣，好和壞，我們又度過了一年。摔在後面的是失望，跑在前面的又是希望，讀者們，如果好意的祝福，並不困爲我們同在愁苦的狀態中而拒絶接受的話，讓我們在這新的一年開始的第一日，我們暫把過去一年經歷的愁苦的時間及其相聯繫的不快事件切斷，我們張開手來歡迎這新來的一年及其相聯繫的有希望的未來。自然我們不能抺煞事實，而閉起眼睛來説，我們的苦難，已隨着過去一年而俱去，我們的光明的前途，也隨未來的一年而俱來。昧然講出這樣話的人，不是存心騙人，卽是循着舊例在説類似「恭喜發財」等的吉利話，想使聽者聊以開顔吧了。事實是吉利話無論説得怎樣　，怎樣多，怎樣動聽，對於現實是没有多大用處的。（愛聽吉利話的人，又是一種心理，當作别論。）客觀的形勢决不因説了幾句吉利話而有所改變。我們知道在這樣不景氣下，在飢餓綫上的人不知有多少，在死亡綫上，不知有多少人，在投黃浦者，不知有多少人，在失業者，不知有多少人，在預備收縮者，不知有多少店家，在預備關門者，不知有多少店家。這樣吉利話卽是願意説，而聽者又有誰呢？無疑，吉利話，雖不是多餘的，也是無意義的。因此所謂「快樂的新年」，其實質是不快樂的。</p>
<p>所以新年的到來，對於大多數人，正如一個陌生人，一個惡客，一個不幸的命運一樣，不願意它光臨，而又不得不讓它光臨。誰也只有挺身去經歷。時間的歷程無法超過與逗留的，而在與時間相聯繫的演變中的人事，却多少受我們自己支配的。人事的不善，不是别人的過錯，而是我們自身的不努力，問題的重心，就在這兒了。正面去對着問題，努力去打開問題的紐結呢？還是退縮到墓地的旁邊，哀唱没落地　歌呢？在暴風雨之夜的行在急流中的孤舟，只有向前挺進没有後退，前進，則港口也許就在目前，後巡則　没可立而待。生活的歷程上只有生存與死亡，絶對没有還價的。有機體如斯，超有機體—社會—亦如斯，向生存—向前進；向死亡—後退。這是新年的例話，也是我們互相勉勵的話。</p>
<h3>新年</h3>
<p>— 臧克家</p>
<p>前些日子路過一個小巷，有一家門聯頗從我的雙眼中喚起了新鮮。時過境遷便不復把這記在心上了。新年近了，心一觸動，那付門聯又浮在眼前了。</p>
<p>『新年不新，</p>
<p>舊年不舊』。</p>
<p>你看了也會覺得可笑吧？然而在笑過之後你也會從中發現點意義嗎？</p>
<p>中國自改用陽曆以來。便有兩個年對立着了。新年給都巿的新人以熱鬧，而舊年仍然給鄕村的舊人以新鮮。</p>
<p>你如果説新年確是新，我不能反駁，因爲每次過新年，都巿裏的氣象確乎不同乎平日，家家門口懸上靑天白日旗，官塲裏行團拜禮，學校舖家也可以解放三天，一通鑼鼓，幾桌酒宴的快活一起。當局宣佈新猷，各種職業團體也定一個新計劃，好似新年一過，眞的萬象更新換了一個新生命似的。</p>
<p>然而在他方面，破產後鄕下的窮人眞有些怕説過年。一過年臨到春深挨餓還不説，在他們心中好似一年不如一年。這不是迷信作崇，而是事實的教訓。</p>
<p>『新年不新』造此語的人，一定是和我有同感吧？</p>
<h3>新年説廢話</h3>
<p>— 魏中天</p>
<p>我一年來的生活實在變得太利害，我自己有時也不會相信，爲什麽會變得這樣利害呢？連我不明白，假如世間眞有所謂「命運」這東西的話，那末要問「命運」才明白了。</p>
<p>去年過新年的時候，我是在××地方，説愉快也不是愉快，説悲哀也不是悲哀的過了一個新年，吃了雞也吃了紅燒肉，而在那天也曾看見一位朋吐了一大堆鮮紅的血！這位友人是爲着失業而吐血的，那麽一個健康的人也會吐血，這給與我的很深刻的印象。不久以後又在廣　州過了個舊的新年，這時候因爲剛從災難中裏逃出來，是感到一點兒愉快的—在廣州只住了一個星期，生活的大風又把我吹到西邊一個城巿裏，在痛苦中在煩悶中生活了幾個月，在那裏雖然只住了短短的幾個月，但那個城巿給了我與多量的回憶，這些回憶自然全是痛苦的！也就是在這個時候，我受了敵人的暗箭，射傷了我的心，使我有一個短時間幾乎想離開了這世界，直到如今，這傷痕仍在是痛着。</p>
<p>終於在八月間我决心離開了那個給與我痛苦的城巿，带着一顆破碎一的心又流到上海，一年不看見的上海我覺得牠瘦了一點我暗想：上海，再過十，年後看你消瘦到什麽程度？</p>
<p>在上海只住了一個多月，我又離開牠了。這一次了離開上涤海是很偶然的，而我是带着希望带着一顆新生的心離開上海的，從這時候起，自己就重新建起了自信心，覺得自己還年輕，如能努力，前途也不是絶望的！</p>
<p>而現在又是新年了，日子快得像射箭的也像電閃，一年的歲月是又悄悄地溜了過去，這一年來我得着什麽呢？一點也没有，有的依然是那般失望的心境。</p>
<p>今年的新年是在東京度過，在異國過新年這算是第一次，當然是要带着笑臉的，明年的新年在那裏過呢？世間眞有所謂「命運」這東西的話，那麽要問「命運」才明白了。</p>
<h3>不知元旦的人</h3>
<p>— ＴＫ</p>
<h3>歲暮的武藏野</h3>
<p>— 香山</p>
<p>在異國的歲暮裏，自家染上了　　的　鄕病，那是這般渺漠，輕盈而纏綿，像黑　節晚上惡　　杆，垂聽教堂的淸微之鐘聲，一樣地纏綿而輕盈呵。</p>
<p>天空是愈更澄淸，在淸晨，推開障子　桔枝上的天空，凝然似固，向天投石，憂然作　，這音波不像春波般四四流傳，宛似簇箭　天；呵是深冬了，這固凝了的天空呵：遠遠地在僻陋的巷裏，那像塞外胡嘯的凄凉之豆腐販的喇叭音，會带給你凄淸之情。</p>
<p>故國縱無戀念之的，但那種能引你耽於戀念的力量，却深潛在奥秘的心裏，一切的美，藝術，往往囚在幻想的桎裏，　過紀德的「田園交響曲」時，能羡慕瞎了眼的盲人的生活呀！幻想與追憶，像抒情詩地給破陋飾上了幽美和綺麗。</p>
<p>像一隻倦於歌唱的雲雀，墊在異國的武藏野哀，是歲暮，武藏野有涸了的小河，枯了的草，和斷了的朽木橋。這隻雲雀，淡淡　的，把眼綫撫摸過一切景物，掠過丘岡，在一座荒凉的菩提寺的後面的墓塲，歇在墓碑上了，墓前有一枝血紅的紅珠兒樹。</p>
<p>我好像這隻雲雀，武藏野的荒凉的菩提寺底墓塲常成了自己溜步的地方。武藏野畜有可歌可泣的愛情故事。歷史的薰味，和許多詩人的慨歌，然而對於我這個流亡的人，武藏野祇有素朴，魅惑了自己，尤其在深夜聽武藏野的徹野之風聲，讀國木田獨步的武藏野日記。這種趣味，是素朴與幻想的綜和。</p>
<p>當天空澄淸的時候，在武藏野的草原和枯樹林的梢上，那頂上蔽着雪的富士，却顯明地髙髙地聳着，富士的魅力，完全集在這皓皓不融的頂上底雪；那種肌冷之感，像利劍似地刺入身心，在一種驚抖裏嘗到滿足。</p>
<p>武藏野不僅僅給與以素朴的感　，還能使人憶起許多　然的和歌與俳句來，這些「歌」和「句」，把富士山與武藏野與以了最顯明的襯映，那野趣就像泉湧似地，地你的眼俯視了一塊土，一根草時都能泌心地感到。</p>
<p>「羣山蒼蒼已蒙夜幕之空中，唯富士之巔，仍潛於黃昏中」，這是田山花袋咏歌冬天武藏野的黃昏後之景色；那漠漠然的廣漠的武藏野的天空，　上了微黑的薄圖，而那富士山的巔却分外映襯得雪白，因此感到是尚在黃昏時候的測憶。這種渺茫的情緖，好像在深霧的街柳下，凝視吉原遊廓的梳着島田式大頭的藝妓的姿態，一樣地富於想像呵。</p>
<p>雖然祇有遠山和多摩川並諸小流，没有一顆珍奇的花，一座壯嚴的屋字，但那在稻田旁放着的便缸，那停着黑色的烏鴉之便缸，却似乎有一種單純的美，農家的　味。</p>
<p>尤其在日中的時候，满野歌散瀰了紅綠的花朶，那是採集田菜，苜蓿的村裏的孩子們呵；他們穿着紅綠的襤褸的衣，用驚異的眼瞳，探索的神氣，發掘自己的食糧，這種　氣與生活的認眞，使一個漫步的異鄕人，感到生活的疎淡來。</p>
<p>已經是冬天了，已經是歲末了，那些背負着竹與松的鄕人，都怱忙的奔向巿裏去，去裝飾巿裏人家的門松去，（日本人過年皆於門前插松竹），道一　義斫去了的松竹之根，都留着折的白痕，在枯草裏點綴着。</p>
<p>祇等待雪的來降了，那時武藏野穿了素色的衣服，富士山戴了素色的冠，一種悽悽之情，給與任何人以想流涙的心境，但又不知道涙從何流的難言的情緖。</p>
<p>武藏野雖蓄有了歷史，愛情，和時間空間的一部，而我的愛戀武藏野的祇是补素，和隨武藏野而憶起的「俳匀」「和歌」而已。</p>
<p>冬之武藏野不是頽廢荒凉，是更朴素，更能慰藉近歲暮而流亡在異國的人。</p>
<h3>家夜小景</h3>
<p>HAPPY　NEW　YEAR！</p>
<h3>有了媳婦的兒子（上）</h3>
<p>— 兪期錦</p>
<p>老福雲顚跛地走來。他的身軀是這末瘦小了，傴僂着；走路這般乏力，喘着氣而带着咳嗽。走近來時，在灰黯的面上裝出一陣勉强的苦笑，抖顫的説：「先生，我求你寫一封信。」</p>
<p>我連聲應着哦，哦，拖着一條凳請他坐。</p>
<p>「信是寫給我兒子的，咳，要他把屁股放了些穏，面上浮起一唇怨憤的神情，「説起兒子，我就要透不過氣來。」</p>
<p>「慢慢地説，有話儘説出來，我給你寫。」我找不出安慰的話。</p>
<p>「對的，先生，要多費你的時光了，我的話很長呢！不要憎惡我，我得先把我要寫這封信的原因講一講。」他有些乞僯似的。</p>
<p>「不，我没有事，你儘慢慢講。」</p>
<p>「唉，我總羡慕人家。不説别的，像先生，令尊眞福氣呢！生下這末好兒子，………」「笑話，好什麽呢！」我把語音打斷了，「且請你把要寫信的原因説給我聽。」</p>
<p>「呃，呃，是的，先生，説給你聽。我很記得：早三十年，我的兒子誕生時，我的妻是多麽興奮呀！一天中要説幾十遍：「阿鈞的爸，我們老來有靠了！」但，可憐喲，妻是先我死了；我呢，有誰得知，不靠兒子的老，反在受兒子的難！</p>
<p>他眼角裏有些濕潤，我只會説是的，但没有法子好去慰藉他。</p>
<p>「五年前，我給我兒子娶媳婦，本村上那一個不説：老福雲眞福氣。但又有誰得知呢！媳婦進門後，我的顴骨就是這末髙聳起來。到我的衣服襤褸不堪，——和現在一樣，——人們現着驚疑的神氣問我：老福雲，你的衣服不好，囑你媳婦補綴一下？我搖搖頭，這時我感覺到他們才明白我是没有福氣，反而在受氣了！</p>
<p>「没有媳婦時的兒子，還過得去。在上海做工，一月終有封信給我爹，有時也附些銅錢來給我。但這五年來，我是没有接到兒子的信了，——銅錢還要説什麽呢。——就是兒子回了家，我想以朋友的身份和兒子説説我的苦，不，不能够呀，這個媳婦就會站在兒子對面瞪眼，這　眼似乎在説：你不要把心軟下來，不必可憐這老東西。</p>
<h3>蒼蠅（四）</h3>
<p>— 意Pirandello作席滌塵譯</p>
<p>他們曽經打了一天半，祇有幾顆杏仁打下來。女工們提議那個晚上全數剥了它，剥到夜深，一就在那裏胡亂睡一下，以便次早天一朦朦亮起身回村。他們當眞這樣做了。洛帕拿了煮好的豆和兩長玻璃瓶酒來。半夜裏剥聲的工作完畢，所有男女工都躺倒在打榖塲上安靜地睡了，打榖塲上留剩的草濕濕的，沾了露水好像天當眞落過雨了。</p>
<p>「唱，利奥拉」！</p>
<p>耐利就即席唱了。月亮打小小黑雲白雲的厚網裏穿進穿出，月亮就像他魯莎的圓臉龐，她隨着愛之歡樂悲苦的升降，時或淺笑，時或發愁。</p>
<p>柴魯一經留宿在馬房裏。天還没亮時候薩羅跑去喚醒他，却見他遍體浮腫，混身發黑，發着沸滚發燙的寒熱。</p>
<p>以上就是耐利告訴剃頭司務的一片話，剃頭司務祇顧聽着，一不留心，注意力漫移在一點上，用他的剃刀割破他了。近下巴那裏，割了一個細小細小的傷口，説不到什麽。耐利也没有時間來再想到它，因爲在剃頭店門口，他遇到魯莎同她的母親，還遇到尼塔，鰣密亞，許給柴魯的可憐的姑娘，她哀哀地哭泣着。</p>
<p>百般勸解才使得這可憐的小人兒明白，她是不能够上蒙脱魯沙去看她的愛人；一；他們盡力招他回來，她會在天黑以前看到他。薩羅這時候也趕來了，大聲説醫生已經上了騾子，不髙興再等了。耐利拖開魯莎，求她耐點心兒；天黑以前，他自會回來，有許多美妙的話對她説。</p>
<p>對於愛人，當眞，就便是這種别人危急的事，也是一　美妙的話；講起來，手執着手兒，眼　着眼兒。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>新年禮讚</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>孩子時代常存着一個夢想：「天天過新年就好了。」就説成人們吧，只要家裏的米缸幸而還未見底，誰又不願意歡歡喜喜的過幾天呢？</p>
<p>新年是充溢着和平，幸福，希望，的日子呵。</p>
<p>譬如早上睡在床上，卽使被阿大阿二爭吃年糕團或甩金錢砲而鬧醒了，睡眠未足，平日的話，少不得要駡幾聲「小鬼」，但在新年，這肝火决不會發起來，也許還變得很氣熱，和小嘴兒接幾個甜吻，或者再信口許下幾個預約，買玩具啦，做新衣啦，領去看戲啦。至於實行不實行，都可隨便，而孩子們總會拉開嘴巴對你表示好感，就是等到他們發覺自己被哄騙的時候，横竪新年早已過去了。</p>
<p>又譬如幾天以來，曽經飽受金錢上的麻煩和窘迫，到了新年儘可忘得乾乾凈凈。在大除夕幾乎要鬧進警局的兩位朋友，新年見了面，仍一樣滿臉春風，恭恭手「發財發財」地互相祝賀着，心頭已給一種不平凡的欣悦所塡滿。又有些人在年底不免顯露着一些窮相，可是，一到新年遇見他的時候，就得洗耳恭聽他賭博勝負的報告，他又似乎很有錢的樣子了。</p>
<p>再譬如，在家裏吃飯的時候，平日或者不免會引起小小糾紛，諸如自己胃口欠佳而嫌鹹黃魚太淡，牙齒痛偏怪飯煮得硬，孩子吃相不好之類的事情，而這種事情，在新年裏是决不會計較的了。新年須竭力避免一切糾紛的發生，卽或萬一不測，陔子們亂吐了幾句不吉利的言語，亦必列入「百無禁忌」之攔裏去了。</p>
<p>而且，新年更是懺悔，立志，發愿心的時候，一輩忽然從白天夢裏淸醒過來的人，必曰：「以前種種，譬如昨日死，以後種種，譬如今日生，」新年爲一年之開始，把過去的嫖賭放浪，貪污枉法的行爲統撇了開去，於地，再排定程序，如何洗心革面，如何努力奮鬥，或者，甚至一向不動筆的朋友，居然也買了一本三面頁的日記册，預備放出恒心來每天寫幾百字的日記了。在新年裏，</p>
<p>儘可多發點宏願，多產生點希望，至於過了新年怎樣？根本可不必在新年裏計及。</p>
<p>總而言之，新年的一切現象，是新鮮的，蓬勃的，朝氣的，新年是值得歌頌禮贊的日子呵！</p>
<h3>一九三五年序幕</h3>
<p>— 程銓</p>
<p>無休止地，吹了一夜的冷風。</p>
<p>黎明了，天上透出一點灰色的光，朦朧像初冬的黃昏，流浪人在街角縮一縮身子，打了個呵欠，睜睜開眼來，天亮了。</p>
<p>抺着惺忪的眼睛，站起身來探出頭去望街，街是死寂的，經過了一盡夜的路人的踐踏，像受了傷似的，喘着氣，却也沈沈地在娄息呢。灰白的霜蓋在路面，像病人底蒼白的臉。</p>
<p>店舗子挨家都上着鐵門，隔夜掛出的國旗，不住地在冷風中拍着，跳着。一塊紙牌挺直地掛在門口：恭賀新禧—新年休息三天。</p>
<p>猛地一驚：又是一個年頭了呢。</p>
<p>望天：天始終是死沈沈的。</p>
<p>難道又一個年頭浪過去了嗎？是的，該不會錯吧？瞧着送報人手裏的紅字的報紙，瞧着日曆小販手中的紅色「一月一日」，心頭像起了一千條縐絞似地：凖没錯兒，又一個年頭浪過去了。</p>
<p>想着：這年頭，連個人的流浪都成了世界性的啦，當整個地球落進了多風雨的季節的年代，也許誰都有點不舒服的吧？給風雨摧殘着也已經有不少年頭啦；可是，爲什麽那些苦難是始終没有終了的呢？世界像一列走進了山洞的火車，都悠長的烏路哪。</p>
<p>（一輛一九三五的雪鐵龍流綫式轎車，載滿了一車子的醉漢，男的女的，戴着假面舞會中的紙帽，放着彩色的氣球，無目的地衝過來了。）</p>
<p>這年剅，能把自己放到麻醉中去，也許是幸福的。</p>
<p>冷風還没有停止，吹着吹着，便打了一個寒噤：都希望太陽早一點昇起啊，都希望有一個溫暖的春天啊。</p>
<p>像祈求，又像歲朝的祝福，默禱着，抬起頭來看太陽，太陽還躱在烏雲裏哩，心碰地往下一沈，便無意識地笑了笑。</p>
<p>（街上有孩子們在擲着響砲，聲音淸朗地飄過街。天光漸漸地亮起來了，街上走着各式的人，休了假的事務員，停了課的學生。）</p>
<p>一種新的氣象呢。</p>
<p>是的。當一個新的年頭到來的時候，每個人都會給自己一個新的希望，新的開始的吧？不管它是美麗的或是醜惡的，人跨進了這年頭，人便得本能地生活下去。</p>
<p>每個年頭，正像每一本書，當我們打開新書的第一頁，開始讀它的第一個字的時候，誰又能知道它裏面會蘊藏一些什麽東西的呢？</p>
<p>可是，無論是好或壞，總是一個新的開始呢。</p>
<p>據説一九三六年是一個緊張的年頭，那未做它貼隣的一九三五也許不是一個平凡的吧？在這未來的年頭面前存在着二種東西：生存與死亡，歡樂與悲慘。</p>
<p>進展到這個緊張的階段的時代，是值得歌頌的，前面凖有一些更光輝的事件存在着：生存的光榮啊。</p>
<p>可是，光明也好，黑暗也好；不怕是無盡的暴風雨還是一天的好太陽；要來，就快一些到臨吧。</p>
<p>祈禱這個新的一九三五吧，在多風雨的季候中，希望它是光榮的一個！</p>
<h3>又是一年</h3>
<p>— 吳葉</p>
<p>光陰只像電影般的，一幕一幕地在眼前閃過，一年三百六十五天的時間，祇在一刹那便溜走了，啊！這正是一歲月如流」！我嘆惜着將案上的那　舊的</p>
<h2>Page 39</h2>
<p>日歷移去了，又把一架簇嶄全新的，民國二十四年份日歷來補充這個遺缺。</p>
<p>一年已經過去了而接着又有一年大踏步的闖進了人間：自然，我從這悄悄地一來一去之間。却又増加了一歲年齡，那本生命史也不免要輕輕地翻過一頁了。然而，且試把這過去的一頁檢查一下，究竟有没有足以安慰過去而鼓勵將來的？我敢説在過的的一年，鼓勵安慰都談不到，除了年齡的増加一歲，其他依然故我！</p>
<p>那末我對這一歲的開始，將預備些什麽禮物來獻祝呢？在這個年頭兒，旣無喜可賀，更不用自己來善頌善禱；可是一味消極悲觀却也不應該，現在事情所擺在我們面前的，還是需要我們自己去掙扎，去幹，無論政治的督促，教育的建設，農村的救濟，社會的改進，商業的復興，民族的强盛，道德的尊崇……等，在在都要期待着政府和民衆的合作，合作起來實一去幹才是。</p>
<p>回顧到過去的我國，無論政治社會國家民族，幾乎無日無時不在黑暗中摸索，黒暗中掙扎。這時的國家多難是不容諱言的，天災相侵，人禍汜濫，内憂外患，我人民所受之痛苦，眞是不堪回首</p>
<p>，我們現在希望從痛苦中掙扎得安慰，在黑暗中奮鬥光明來。自然囉，我們對這新歲的前瞻有着偉大的展望，至於其事實能否如願，那却要待諸將來了。</p>
<h3>過年</h3>
<p>— 胡天宇</p>
<p>自家並不姓王，也不呌小二，但命運的鑄定，却和王小二是一樣的——一年不如一年。</p>
<p>故鄕有句土話，是：「今年巴望明年好，年年穿件破綿襖。」這話頗带幽默性，可惜不大眞切。以我的經歷，的確，我是無時無刻不在巴望，今天就巴望明天好，今年就巴望明年好，但却不一定是「年年穿件破綿襖」。這樣説，並不是説我的巴望已經實現，果然好起來了，不穿破綿襖，而穿新綿襖，或者西裝皮大衣，事實上，不但西裝皮大衣和新綿襖没得穿，就是破綿襖我有時也感缺乏。是的，不是有一個冬天我是穿着破夾袍過去的嗎？</p>
<p>效「漁光曲」中的口氣：「前年留下的破綿襖，小心再靠牠過一冬」</p>
<p>現在新年到了，溫暖的春天將要降臨，不久我該可以脱却這件很不體面的破綿襖了吧；因爲我雖窮，却是很愛體面的。</p>
<h3>願大家莫辜負此年頭</h3>
<h3>歲暮</h3>
<p>— 許希珍</p>
<p>（維也納花店的玻璃窗裏陳列着的是天竺與臘梅，紅與黃的二重奏。</p>
<p>「冬至新年禮物大减價，連日擁擠，光顧從速！」</p>
<p>爵士樂中的假面舞會，化裝舞會，紅的氣球，綠的氣球。擁腫的聖誕老人，手裏的小啦叭「鳴」的一聲呌，笑了。）</p>
<p>笑了，天發商店的老板對太太説：「别急，急有什麽用呢？現在是年底了，可是離結賑期還有個把月，好歹總得把這個年關渡過去的。」</p>
<p>太太有點不相信，依舊縐着眉頭，像要哭的樣子；還有店裏的「阿大先生」心裏也有點疑惑，他担心今年的巿面會更不好，倒賑會更多，通貨會更加「兜不轉。」</p>
<p>可是老板自己是不相信的，自己從學生意」出身，做雜貨商，少説也有二十來年了，年底没有巿面是從來没有遇到過「三春靠一冬」，要不這麽還能做什麽買賣嗎？他笑别人痴人怕天坍，眼界小，没見識。</p>
<p>不過事實上，老板也許眞有些兒糊塗了，照平常，從學徒出身，又在「洋貨生意」上打了二十來年浪的人，這一點是不會看不出的巿面是一年不如一年了，每一個節關的前後統得倒掉幾片店，這還别去説它——單就説今年的「外國冬至」汎吧，照樣的裝起紅綠電燈，照樣的掛起大减價的旗幟，可是買賣却實在不如去年了，一星期來賣下來的錢剛抵過了「門面開銷」，人工勞力算是白丢！——這些情形，老板是不打算多想的——也許是不敢想。他祇把全部的希望放在結賑期的前後，他知道得狠淸楚，那兒還有一個「舊歷年」在等着他，他得用全部的精力去對付，去掙扎。</p>
<p>可是他也許在幾個深夜裏細細地打算過；有二個難題横在他的前面：内面的是自己店裏需要一點滋養，譬如説，把門面刷一刷新多裝上一店幌子的廣告，或者弄得好點的話，也許可以弄一架收音機，此外最要緊的便是店得添點貨；可是這一些全成問題的自己店裏是虚得剩一個骨架了，没有現錢是什麽都不能辦的而還有一個外面的大障礙，便是規模較大的同業的惡意的競爭；人們利用了大規模的優利，把物價降到小同行所不能達到的低賤，而一面又利用了大廣告的號召，儘可能地拚命想吸收一點現金，而這些，却全是扼住了中小商的喉管的兇手！</p>
<p>這二座龐大的假想敵，像二座沈重和翳影，重重壓在天發商店老板底心頭，死命地不肯放鬆，他覺到這種窒息是危險的。「也許有這麽一天，自己會在敵人底面前倒下來的。」</p>
<p>然而這些困難，雖然朝朝夜夜地把他鎭壓着，但是他是不肯在臉上洩露出來的；他不是大企業家，當然缺不「鐵的腕力」，可是他也有他底打算，他也有他底方針。目前唯一的辦法，就是先想法向幾家熟識的「字號」裏去「抗」（註：移挪的意思）一點貨色來，凖備全副的精力去對付結賑期前的「舊歷年」。</p>
<p>可是第二天他起了一個早，往熟識的素有往來的家家字號一跑，便明白事情是没有他預想的那麽好辦了。從各家得到的回答全差不多：「眞是怪不好説的，我們都是老户，難道説還有信相不過的嗎？不過裏面吩咐的，説從年關到結賑期間，一律只做現金交易，不做往來——實住是時也不好，怕到年底有什麽兜不轉的地方——這點難處你是知道的。」</p>
<p>這些話也許是眞情，可是天發商店的老板却立刻給推到冰窟裏去了，他覺得一陣冷，站起來回到自己店裏，幾個伙計正在翻看桌上的日報，猛地他瞥見了「××號淸算通告」的啟事，像得了啟示似的，隨口向一個伙讦問：</p>
<p>「年内送廣告到報館去還來得及吧？」</p>
<p>「一凖來得及，今天還祗二十六，報館遂廣告要二十八截止哩——元旦，我們又有紅報看了，一大疊！」</p>

<h3>新年獻詞</h3>
<p>— 記者</p>
<p>恭賀新禧！—當讀者諸君翻開一九三五年的第一張電影專刊的時候，這四個字似乎是再適當不過的了。</p>
<p>因爲是新年的原故，大家都有一夥快樂的心，吃飽了好酒好菜，走向影戲院去，嘻嘻哈哈的度過這快樂的一天。</p>
<p>因爲是新年的原故，大家都除舊迎新，有如身上的新衣新帽一樣，在心頭滿懷着新的希望。譬如希望今年結婚生子，希望今年有機會在政界上活動活動，希望今年得中五十萬頭奬，不，希望今年能够不失業。</p>
<p>因爲是新年的原故，對於憂國憂民之士，自然並不怎樣開心。譬如國難深重，又是一年過去。經濟恐慌的深入，失業人羣的増加，在這年頭少不了更加尖鋭化。九國公約的撒毁，軍縮的反面是軍備極力擴充，第二次大戰就在目前，我國人民在遠東戰塲將必然的成爲砲灰。這些，在大年初一道及，未免使人掃興，甚而至於使懷着滿腔希望的人們冷了半截。不過不説也是無用，在沉默中並不能轉禍爲福。</p>
<p>因爲是新年的原故，電影界的諸君子，自然也有新的打算。譬如製片者希望今年從業員們特别賣力，増加生產。觀衆們忽然有錢起來，不分晝夜的看戲。多來幾部超特的出品，打破去年的賣座紀錄。另一方面，導演，攝影，佈景等中上層從業員們，除了希望自己產生世界名作之外，也希望由一二百元加薪到四五百元不等。卽使事實上很少可能，希望總不妨大一點的。演員們希望今年一躍而爲明星，明星們希望得着皇帝或者皇后的加冕，因而揭幕啦，臉孔做商標啦，外快收入，麥克麥克。至於攝影塲的小工們，除了希望不致於觸電以死之外，還希望不致被公司不問情由的逐出攝影塲，以免妻兒子女，啼啼哭哭</p>
<p>因爲是新年的原故，電影專刊自然也在一些起碼的希望。譬如説電影專刊本來就不談什麽「革命」或是「前進」，在這年頭，能够説幾句必須説而又可以説的話，已經是很了不起的。同時，電影專刊始終維持公正的立塲，不諛媚，不附和，不苟且，義務宣傳則有之，拿津貼，瞎捧塲，决不嘗試。所以，希望人們不要曲解破壞。而愛護本刊的諸君，不斷的給我們批評，指正，記者當代表本刊竭誠歡迎。至於本刊的改進計劃，當然也是有的，然大可不必大鑼大鼓，大吹大擂了一陣，而後執行。</p>
<p>話説到這裏爲止，回顧上文，並不見得能使讀者諸君嘻笑顔開，反而不免納悶在懷，在這大好新年，當然不甚妥當。不過在此不妨補救一下，反正禮多人不怪，再來一個：</p>
<p>恭賀新禧！</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「大路」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>電影的現實主義，在中國是被强調的要求着的，那一部電影是正確的表現現實，它便將成爲偉大的作品。進一步説，我們要求電影作者，科學的觀察現實，從而正確的分析，體騐，然後在電影作品上大膽而勇敢地，一點不加粉飾的表現出來。也就是説，誰反應現實最積極，誰便是時代的最偉大的作家，因而他的作品也就最能爲廣大的觀衆所擁護。</p>
<p>不錯，在現階段我們還得要求新的羅曼蒂克，然而這種羅曼蒂克是從現實出發的。卽是説，從正確的理解現實，而科學的决定其必然的前途，也就是説在今日中看到明日必然的產生。這未來的熱烈憧憬是被作爲羅曼蒂克的，但是這决不是不能實現的空想，而是有着歷史的决定意義的。因此我們要求着新的羅曼蒂克，同時我們却反對羅曼蒂克的空想。</p>
<p>看了「大路」之後，以上的話似乎有强調的提出之必要。這因爲「大路」中羅曼蒂克的成份是遠遠的超過了現實主義之重量的。</p>
<p>當探討「大路」之内在的時候，我們是不妨將作者以前的幾部作品聯繫起來觀察的。被稱爲詩人的孫瑜先生，在「小玩意」中，他大聲的呐喊着全體人民抗日救中國，救自己。他將救中國的任務加担在全體人民身上，所以他對於民族工業家有着熱烈的希望，同時廣大的民衆反帝，站在跳舞塲的陽台上的紳士淑女們也反帝，就這一點來説，自然是缺乏現實性的吧，然而作者熱情的羅曼蒂克，却是充份的表現出來。以後，他的「體育皇后」中提出了嶄新的體育觀，在最後提出了作爲羅曼蒂克的結論，那便是體育的大衆化。當然這一未來的展望是從現實出發的，給與人們很大的欣慰。但是現在又看到和「小玩意」同一姿態的「大路」了。</p>
<p>在「大路」和序幕中，作者在他的主題歌（開路先鋒）裏所給與我們的啟示是「幾千年的化石，積成了地面的山峯，前途没有路，人類不相通。是誰障碍了我們的進路？………」於是他呐喊着：「挺起了心胸，團結不要鬆！」「嘆息無用」，「我們是開路的先鋒」，「我門要引發地下埋藏的炸藥，對凖了牠轟！」「天翻地動，炸倒了山峯，大路好開工。」……在這裏他對於人類未來的熱情，乃是在雄壯的音調中表現出來的了。那未誰來担負這偉大的重任呢？作者將它加担在廣大的工人身上，在「大路歌」中他要路工們「背起重担朝前走！」「大家努力，一齊向前！」「壓平路上的崎嶇，輾碎前面的艱難，」「一齊作戰」，「没有後退只向前」。但是這種熱情是寄托於非現實的故事中，卽是説「大路」並非眞實的表現。最主要的是他將路工們的生活美化起來，差不劇中人如黎莉莉，金燄諸人都是非現實的人物。</p>
<p>自然，作者一貫的向上的精神，明快，歡欣，朝氣的表現，都説明作者精神的偉大。可是就在這種塲合證明作者的忽視了現實，不，也許他是深知道現實痛苦，而以精神的光榮以克服這種痛苦。很顯明的，當路工們給漢奸拷打的時候，他在劇中人身上充分的表現了從容就義的精神。但是那樣的地窖，黎莉莉那樣的賣弄風情，那樣的機警勇敢，都使人懷疑；難道世界上眞有這種事麽？如此，「大路」在反應現實的一點上，却不免是十分薄弱的了。至於軍官和土豪劣紳站在對立的地位，甚至於帮助着路工們等等，也是很值得討論的。而「精神不死」這一點，雖然眞實的表現，可是在用心上却無可厚非。</p>
<p>不過我們對於這一作品，始終感覺着很大的興趣，那樣明快的情調，那樣剛毅的精神，更由於配音的音響效果之良好的運用，無論在那一方面都是將作品的内容表現出來了的。</p>
<p>從各方面來説，這「大路」是和「小玩意」相差無幾的。孫瑜先生在「小玩意」中的一切，在「大路」中又重現起來，的確，作者是一個詩人，一個熱情奔放的詩人。他嫉恨醜惡，他憧憬着未來的光明，但是他没有正視醜惡的實質，同時他没有脚踏實地的追求未來的光明。然而我們對於他懷着熱誠的期望，希望在不久的將來，他將從非出發於現實的羅曼蒂克的作風中改變過來。</p>
<p>其他屬於技術方面的種種，因限於篇幅，恕從略了。</p>

<h3>看護韻事（The　White　Parade）(下)</h3>
<p>— 素因</p>
<p>龍納華爾和𤩞發生了愛情之後，就勸𤩞中止她的看護工作，嫁給他作夫人。但是𤩞不答�，仍舊繼續她的學業。這個時候，齊姐，因爲認識一位醫院裏的學習醫生名摩爾的，常常在下午工作完畢的時候一同出去玩，到深晚才加回醫院。醫院裏的看護監督因爲娜屢次晚回，違犯醫院規則，就警告她，並且告訴她，她應當務備一筆欵子，好回家去安度假日。</p>
<p>那是𤩞在醫院裏實習看護的最後一年了，有一天，𤩞參加了龍納的生日慶祝會。她因爲醫院的院章，不得不早回醫院。但是龍納不許她回去，而𤩞呢，一定要他早些送她回去。因此他他們二人中間發生了一回爭執。後來龍納經究拗不過她，提早送她回了醫院。不過那時龍納已經喝了不少的酒，在送𤩞到了醫院回家的路上，汽車出了事，而龍納受了很重的傷，被人抬到密契李德醫院去醫治。他經過了一番手術治療，漸漸恢復了他的體力，不過他在醫院住了幾個星期之後，就要求醫院派𤩞做他的專任看護。𤩞不肯答應，因爲她已經答應了另外一個女病人，在她受痛苦的時候，不要離開她。𤩞因爲不肯失信於那個病人，祗好讓龍納一個人去生氣發脾氣了。𤩞的這種行爲，深爲醫院裏的一般人所敬佩，其中尤其以外科主任湯尼醫生爲最，他説𤩞是再可靠没有的人了。同時湯民醫生的夫人，和他意見不和，特地跑到巴黎去提出離婚訴訟。湯民在這個時候，精神上感覺到極度的痛苦，幸虧𤩞了解他的心事，時時加以安慰。湯民於是對於𤩞的感情，更加深切了一層。</p>
<p>這時離畢業的日子，祗有一個星期了。齊姐因爲接連三晚，很晚的回到醫院，因此被教職聯席會議一致决定了開除學籍，不得畢業。齊姐不傷心極了，她所最傷心的，却是因爲時常带她一同出去的摩爾醫生，反覺行所無事的毫不在乎。那天龍納齊巧在醫院裏養息好了，要出醫院了𤩞特爲請了一位同學，代替她工作，好自己去送龍納。她臨走的時候，忽然想起了一個麻醉劑藥箱的鑰匙，忘記了交給她的替工。她於忽忙之中，就將那鑰匙交給了一個開電梯的僕役，而那個僕役就順手將鑰匙交給了齊妲，因爲齊妲正同着麻醉劑藥箱放置的房間裏去。不想齊姐拿到了那把鑰匙，就偷偷開了藥箱，取了許多嗎啡呑服了希圖自盡。幸虧她服毒不久，就被人發覺了。於是大家七手八脚，將她灌救了一番，齊妲因此得慶埸生。但是𤩞因爲一時的疏忽，幾乎弄出人命大事，依照醫院院章，是應當受解職的處份的。但是湯尼竭力替她疏通因此𤩞得保留她的地位。</p>
<p>那個奇怪的南方女朗恩娜，對於工作旣不悉心研究，對於考試，又着漫不經心，但是畢業考試揭曉，她竟安然及格了。她非但自己畢業及格，她并且可憐齊妲，代她籌劃，竟將她的原職恢復了。這一下子，一班同學如同受了個靑天霹靂，不知恩娜到底有什麽法力。後來才知道她的父親，就是這醫院的財務代理人，所以對於醫院的行政，有自由處置之權也。她們行畢業禮了。行完畢業禮之後，龍納從新來向𤩞請求她放葉了看護的職業，嫁給他做個富家少奶奶。但是𤩞覺得她是應當服務於人羣的，她竟犧牲了社交界領袖的虚榮，去就個看護之職。結果她得到了湯尼醫生整個的諒解，向她默默表示贊許和欽佩，而一塲韻事，亦就到此爲止。（完）</p>

<h3>上海巿圖書館博物館工程概要</h3>
<p>— 董大酉</p>
<p>張裕泰營造廠承造</p>
<p>一、弁言</p>
<p>文化與人生不可須臾離，都巿爲人口集中之地，文化建設尤屬當務之亟，上海巿居民已達三百四十餘萬，而前此各項文化設備或規模過小，或竟付缺如，詎非憾事！上海巿政府有鑒於此，爰經於巿中心區域，劃定面積廣大之行政區，以一部分爲文化設備之用，並奬勵私人團體於此租地創辦關係文化教育之陳列塲所。民國二十三年初，巿政府及所轄多數局處旣遷入巿中心區，爲實現大上海計劃之張本，以文化建設不容或緩，除於行政區西南籌設巿體育塲以供巿民鍜鍊體魄之需要外，並議於行政區内興築巿立圖書館僣博物館，爲巿民學藝上研究觀摩之資。乃者巿體育塲已告興工，其内容梗概亦經另册露佈。茲兩館奠基，爰將其建築佈置之一斑，略述如次，以餉各界人士。</p>
<p>二、圖書館</p>
<p>本館位於巿中心區行政區，在府前右路與府南右路之間。府西外路之南，坐西朝東：與博物館相對。平面作「工」字形，而於前部兩端横展向前後突出，成廂屋狀。南北兩端最大距離約六十六公尺，東西兩端最大距離約五十一公尺，建築面積約一千六百二十平方公尺，各層面積合計約三千四百七十平方公尺，容積約二萬五千立方公尺。</p>
<p>本館之大部分爲二層建築，外墻平均髙約十二公尺。惟正面中央設門樓，其屋脊髙出地面約二十五公尺（參閲圖書館正面側面圖）。將來如有擴充之需要，毋需將現有館屋加髙，僅須就後面餘地添建層數相同之房屋，卽可増加容量至二倍以上。</p>
<p>館屋之外觀，取現代建築與中國建築之混合式樣，因純採中國式樣，建築費過昂，且不盡合實用也。門樓則用黃色玻璃瓦蓋，附以華麗之簷飾，其四週之平臺圍以石欄杆，充分顯示中國建築色彩。全部建築物係鋼筋混凝土防火構造，外墻則用人造石砌築。大門前設大平臺，種植花木。平臺前兩邊各豎旗杆，以壯觀瞻。</p>
<p>關於内部地面層之佈置，中央入門處爲大廳，寛約十二公尺，深約十三公尺，旁通兩翼之過道及登樓大梯。大廳後爲雜誌報紙閲覽廳，寛約十七公尺，深約十四公尺。再後爲書庫，寛約三十公尺，深約十一公尺，直通後門。此項書庫爲特髙之一層式（外墻約高十三公尺半），以便裝置五層二公尺餘髙之鋼製書架，其書籍排列之總長約一萬五千公尺，容書約四十萬卷。左翼之下層爲各項辦公室，右翼之下層爲兒童圖書室，繕本書庫，演講廳（寛約十公尺，長約十八公尺）。</p>
<p>第二層中央分兩部，前面爲展覽室，寛約二十二公尺，長約十三公尺半，後面爲借書室及目錄室，寛約十七公尺，長與上同。左右翼僞過道，研究室，特别閲覽室，其兩端横展部分各爲閲覽室，寛約二十六公尺，長約十公尺，可各容一百五十座位。</p>
<p>第二層中央前部之上，有夾層。爲儲藏室，由此達後面平屋面，藉露天梯級以登門樓。此項門樓可用作陳列廳，其四週平臺則備登臨遠眺之需。雜誌報紙閲覽廳下面，開挖一部分，建地下室，爲裝置鍋爐之用。</p>
<p>大廳，借書室，陳列廳内部均用純粹中國式富麗裝飾，設硃紅色之柱。樓梯及過道地面舖磨光石，閲覽室樓面舗軟木塊，其餘部分之地面樓面用花舖檀木及樹膠塊。</p>
<p>本館工程經費預算爲三十萬元，書庫内鋼質書架之建造費除外。建築工程由張裕泰得標承辦，於二十三年九月開工，預定二十四年八月落成。</p>
<p>三、博物館</p>
<p>本館在巿中心區域行政區府前左路與府南左路之間，府東外路之南，坐東向西，與圖書館相對。平面形狀與圖書館相仿，惟前翼兩端僅向前突出耳（參閲博物館平面圖）。南北兩端最大距離約六十余公尺，東西兩端最吕距離約五十八公尺建築面積約一千九百平方公尺，各層面積合計約三千四百三十平方公尺，容積約一萬九千立方公尺。</p>
<p>本館之中部及前面兩翼，爲二層建築外牆髙十公尺有半。加有門樓，屋脊約髙二十四公尺。其前面兩翼之突出部分及後面兩翼，則爲單層建築其牆髙六公尺半許（參閲博物館正面側面圖）。本館將來擴充之計劃，亦以就餘地加建爲目標，擴充後之建築面積可増加二倍。</p>
<p>館屋之外觀，大致僣圖書館同，惟門樓梁柱外露，並於左右兩翼凸部分之前，各設噴水池，以資點綴。全部建築物亦爲鋼筋混凝土防火構造，外牆用人造石砌築。</p>
<p>就内部佈置而言，地面層中央入口處爲門廳，寛約十七公尺半，長約十四公尺，登樓之梯級及衣帽售品等室附焉，由此向門爲大廳寛約十一公尺半，長約十八公尺。主要樓梯在焉。大廳兩旁爲過道通前部左右兩翼之辦公，研究，庘藏等室。左翼突出處爲圖書室，寛約十公尺，長約十五公尺，約容座位一百。右翼突出處爲演講室，長寛與圖書室同，約容座位三百。</p>
<p>第二層佈置，中央分三部爲陳列廳及雕刻廳。其中以在前面才爲最大，計寛約十七公尺，長約十四公尺。兩翼爲書畫陳列廳，各寛約十一公尺半，長約二十五公尺。上蓋玻璃頂棚。</p>
<p>中央二層前面陳列廳之上有夾層，地面與後部平屋頂齊平，由此循露天梯級以達第四層之門樓，門樓四週亦設平臺，以便遠眺。門廳之下有地室，爲設置鍋鑪等之用。</p>
<p>内部裝飾以形成陳列物之適當背景爲目標。門廳及主要陳列廳飾以紅柱及宮殿式之彩畫欄栅平頂。大部分地面用磨光石，重要陳列廳地面用花舖檀木，過道亦舖磨光石。各陳列廳室之採光，以多數光綫投射於陳列品，而無反光入觀衆眼目爲鵠的。懸掛繪畫作品之處由上方側面納光，使斜射牆面，俾觀衆於陰影中面對亮畫，更覺明晰。燈光設備，採「間接式」，其旨趣與上同。因上層各陳列廳不設窗牖，而藉玻璃天棚採光，故須用人工方法更換空氣。館屋内置換氣設備，隨時序之遞邅，分别放送冷暖空氣。</p>
<p>本館工程經費預算爲三十萬元，建築工程亦收張裕泰得標承辦。於二十三年九月間開工，預定二十年八月落成。</p>
<p>四、結論</p>
<p>以上所述，僅就上海巿巿中心區圖書博物兩館之工程方面而言。至若設備方面，如圖書雜誌之採集，陳列物品之搜求，自當力求完備，以應促進文化之需要。惟茲事體大，非可一蹴而幾，尚望各界從旁恊助，共襄厥成，不勝馨香禱祝之至矣！</p>

<h3>今日舉行奠基禮之上海巿巿立醫院衛生試騐所工程概要</h3>
<p>— 董大酉</p>
<p>一、弁言</p>
<p>上海巿巿立醫院建於巿中心區域行政區之東，佔地約八十畝，西界府南左路，北接府東外路，東臨華帮路，南對虬江。衛生試騐所又在巿立醫院之東，佔地十畝，在華原路府東外路交角處，二者毘連設置，將形成全巿之醫學中心，而兼有醫學上治療，研究，教育三種設備。建築物之佈置計劃，亦以便於此兩部分之聯絡與統一管理爲原則。</p>
<p>二、巿立醫院</p>
<p>（甲）總計劃　巿立醫院之主要建築物，計分下列九部：（參閲總地盤圖）</p>
<p>内科病院　　　　　　　二所</p>
<p>外科病院　　　　　　　二所</p>
<p>產科及婦科病院　　　　一所</p>
<p>小兒科病院　　　　　　一所</p>
<p>門診部及耳鼻喉眼病院　一所</p>
<p>護士學校及宿舍　　　　一所</p>
<p>管理處及醫學校　　　　一所</p>
<p>以上各項建築物，以管理處及醫學校居中，正面對向府東外路，門診部及耳鼻喉眼病院與護士學校宿舍分立於其兩旁。其他各病院則按「扇骨」形排列於三者之南，其長邊大致對向東西兩面，此種佈置旣屬美觀，又使各部聯絡便利，且空氣流通，光綫充足，建築物間之梯形空地設置園庭，以便痊復期中之病人遊息，諸病院之總容量約有床位一千。</p>
<p>除上述主要建築物外，有職員住宅，男女職員宿舍，廚房，夫役室，車間等附屬建築物。廚房，夫役室車，等置於基地之西南角，府南左路與虬江之旁，以資隔離，而保持各病院等之淸靜。又滬上之風以由東北，西北，東南，三向來者爲最頴，如此佈置，各病院等可免受烟　之侵擾。職員住宅宿舍等</p>
<p>在基地之東南角，華原路與虬江之旁，亦與主要建築物隔離。（乙）初期工程，以巿立醫院規模之宏大，建築經費自屬浩大，勢須分期興工，以紓財力。第一期工程以適應目前診療上之需要爲限。現在建築中之主要房屋。爲總計劃中之管理處，及醫學校，完成後將暫供醫院用途。該屋長約八十公尺，深約十六公尺，建築面積約一千零六十平方公尺。各層面積合計約四千五百平方公尺，中部連地室凡六層，兩翼則爲四層。</p>
<p>外觀取直綫表現之簡單現代化式樣，與中心區域行政區内各公共建築物相配襯。因中國式建築造價較昂，且基地之利用難期經濟，故未整個採用，然裝飾方面，則取爲規範，俾於現代設備之中，脸寓有本國文化之精神。本建築物係鋼範混凝土構造，外墻用人造石，内部過道之隔墻用空心磚砌築，内部之分間墻則大都以木條構造，以便將來易於移拆改造。各病室之地面舖樹膠塊，　堂手術室及各工作室等之地面，則舖磨光石。（未完）</p>

<h3>New Year's Message</h3>
<p>— Ting</p>
<p>On the Only Way to Save the Nation and Ensure Survival in the Future: Rectifying Domestic Affairs</p>
<p>The depth of winter is waning, the warmth of spring is gradually returning, and the twenty-fourth anniversary of the founding of our Republic of China, along with this New Year's Day, has arrived. At this critical juncture of national crisis, our hearts filled with sorrow as we witness the hardships, a myriad of emotions welling up within us, we are loath to pick up empty words and feign joy to greet the spring. However, recalling the ancient saying, "A year's plan starts in spring," how could we dare not, on this day of New Year's greetings, offer our humble sincerity and discuss our hopes? Fortunately, among the officials and the people, there is no lack of worthy individuals; the heart of the people has not yet died, and the affairs of the nation can still be salvaged. May our precarious and near-extinct Chinese nation be renewed like the seasons. We offer our heartfelt wishes!</p>
<p>Alas, ever since the opening of the seas, our country has been struggling under the iron heels of imperialism for nearly a century. The calamity of foreign aggression, which was already severe in the past, is now even more intense. Since the extraordinary incident of September 18th, the people of our nation have rushed to the gates of the League of Nations, pleading and crying out until their strength was exhausted and their voices hoarse; yet it has not made up for the pain of lost territories and provinces. Coming down to recent times, the international situation has become even more urgent. The so-called crisis of 1936 has already appeared before our eyes, and dark clouds of war are gathering in the East Asian continent. The confrontation between powerful neighbors is becoming increasingly blatant, with swords drawn and bows bent, ready to be unleashed at any moment. As the weak, how can we escape this great calamity once war breaks out? Given the perilous situation today, we absolutely cannot hesitate and hope for a fluke; moreover, the fact that foreign aid cannot be relied upon entirely has already taught us a lesson. If we truly wish to save ourselves from destruction and safely navigate through the difficulties of this national crisis, then we must begin by rectifying our domestic affairs. President Wang once said, "Rectifying domestic affairs is the diplomatic policy China should adopt today." This is a self-evident truth that cannot be compromised or forced in the slightest.</p>
<p>Speaking of rectifying domestic affairs, there are three most important keys: first, implementing equitable distribution of power; second, clarifying official governance; and third, completing the period of political tutelage. All three of these may seem like old sayings, lacking in profound arguments, but in reality, there is nothing mysterious or arcane about the way to govern a country. If we can grasp the key points and proceed step by step, we will eventually reach a point where success comes naturally.</p>
<p>(1) Chiang and Wang, the two leading authorities, jointly issued a telegraphic message on the eve of the Fifth Plenary Session, with earnest and profound words, which commentators have regarded as the most important document in recent years. The telegraph began by saying, "The way to save the nation today lies in unity; and the key to achieving unity lies in peace." Peace and unity have long been what the people of the nation have longed for; and in today's time of multiple internal and external troubles, this declaration carries a special significance. Why? Because the nation has reached a point where its vitality is almost exhausted. The melons on the vine cannot be picked again. The people's eagerness for good governance surpasses their longing for rain in a great drought! Now that the highest military and political leaders have made this open and aboveboard declaration, local authorities should focus on their duties and serve the public wholeheartedly, rather than being alarmed by rumors and creating unnecessary fears. From now on, anyone who violates the spirit of the telegraphic message, continues to imitate the old ways of corrupt warlords, recklessly takes action, and raises troops to create chaos, causing this state of fragile stability to relapse into turmoil, should know that the people are watching, and they will not be easily forgiven! Commander-in-Chief Chiang, in his conversation with Japanese reporters at the end of November last year, said, "I can guarantee that China will not experience another civil war." These words echo the telegraphic message. However, the aspiration for peace and unity must be shared by both the central and local governments; otherwise, if one side goes against the trend of the times and the public will, to the point that the other side cannot uphold its promise, then the responsibility will still not escape the judgment of the world!</p>
<p>The telegraph also stated, "Peace and unity are the common policy of the entire nation today, but to truly achieve them, the central government must relieve the local governments of their concerns and dispel their doubts; at the same time, the local governments must be genuinely sincere in sharing weal and woe with the central government, abide by the overall policies of the nation, obey the law and follow orders, and eliminate the old situation of separatism or de facto confrontation." Therefore, it advocates using the equitable distribution of power system stipulated in the Outline of National Reconstruction as the highest principle for dividing the powers between the central and local governments, and then, based on this principle, determines the five key points of the equitable distribution of power system as the common goal for the central and local governments to believe in and abide by in the future. We have always felt that those in the central government often advocate centralization of power, while those in local government often speak of decentralization of power. Such diverging paths lead to each province governing itself, resembling division, with central government orders not extending beyond the capital, while local self-governance, without the protection of a national constitution, also fails to make any progress. Therefore, the nation bears the name of unity in vain, while the localities have the reality of division. The Outline of National Reconstruction stipulated by the Premier states that affairs of a nationwide nature should be assigned to the central government, while affairs of a nature suited to local conditions should be assigned to the local governments. Its intention is to make the nation a unified and interconnected whole, with a natural distribution in the execution of affairs. Chiang and Wang had already discussed the meaning of the equitable distribution of power system in detail in their telegram in February last year, and the draft constitution of the Legislative Yuan also contains provisions for this system. However, few people have made concrete proposals as to what constitutes the key to achieving an equitable distribution of power; this began with the telegraph. Among the five key points mentioned therein, the first concerns the legal system, the second concerns the power to appoint personnel, the third concerns local administration and economic facilities, the fourth concerns finance, and the fifth concerns military and police weapons. All five of these have concrete objectives and can be used as a basis for action, and they are both reasonable and practical. If they can be effectively promoted and flexibly applied, the spirit of the equitable distribution of power system can be fully realized, and the path to long-term national stability and peace will not be far off. The principles of the telegraph have been approved by the Fifth Plenary Session and submitted to the Central Political Council for detailed regulations. We earnestly hope that these regulations will be promulgated as soon as possible, and even more so that they will be smoothly implemented after promulgation. However, real-world difficulties are ultimately inevitable; and the most worrisome aspect is the last item in the five key points, namely, "The command and control of the national regular army must be unified under the central government, but during the transitional period, based on the peacetime chain of command, the appointment and dismissal of subordinates may be reported by their highest responsible officer to the central government for appointment."</p>
<p>At the beginning of last year, President Wang had a sense of regret regarding the Fujian Incident. On January 9, during the Central Memorial Week, he said, "Our country's political and economic power is not easily concentrated, so there are frequent military rebellions; and because the military organization is not fully developed and military training is not fully adequate, the quality of the soldiers is not good, and they are often manipulated by generals, forming private army systems. If this kind of system cannot be eliminated, then neither constitutional government nor political tutelage can be realized." When President Sun discussed the fundamental issues of China's constitutionalism, he also said, "The biggest obstacle to China's becoming a unified country is that military power has not yet been unified." Commander-in-Chief Chiang has been in command of the military for many years, and his sense of the need for unified military power is naturally more acute than others. Therefore, before the Fifth Plenary Session, he jointly issued a telegraph with President Wang, advocating the unification of the military power of the regular army; and during the suppression of bandits in Jiangxi, he decided to implement a conscription system to train the people, in order to break the bad habit of local养私兵 under the previous recruitment system. We believe that if the central government can formulate laws in the future to allow the newly promoted conscription system to be implemented as much as possible in various provinces, then the soldiers and the people can be united, the military power and military orders can be unified accordingly, and the rotation of new and old recruits can also set an example for a nation in arms.</p>
<p>(2) The corruption of official governance in our country throughout history has long been criticized by the world. Since the establishment of the Examination Yuan of the National Government, although there have been occasional public competitive examinations, the establishment of a modern civil service system still awaits the future. To be fair, among the staff of political organs throughout the country today, there are many who are both talented and virtuous, but there are also quite a few who rely on connections and relatives and hold positions without performing their duties. Even routine official documents are handled by clerks who are familiar with historical precedents and experienced, while the general superiors only know how to sign documents in the office, and the ordinary staff under the protection of the superiors only smoke, read newspapers, and chat in the office. How can the clerks of the government offices, who become a hereditary class and handle routine official matters, avoid the practice of bribery? How can official governance be clear? Today, those who advocate construction are everywhere, but construction depends on talent. If those with talent harbor sharp weapons but have no place to use their talents, they will become resentful, or even spread seeds of social unrest; while those who are promoted rely on support from the outside and, once in office, spend their days in leisure, wasting public funds, or even exploiting the common people, then how is the establishment of a modern civil service system any different from climbing a tree to catch fish? Solving the problem of youth unemployment is a pressing task for the nation. The National Academic Advisory Council has already been established by the Executive Committee and the Ministry of Education, but the modern government is actually the largest organization for employing people, and its responsibility lies not only in introductions but also in granting real positions. There is a strange phenomenon everywhere in the country where "everyone seeks a job, and everything needs people," which discerning people have lamented together. To remedy this, there must be a great determination to, on the one hand, cut redundant organs and encourage thrift; and on the other hand, subject the personnel eliminated as a result, along with the officials in other organs, to strict screening, retaining those who are suitable and removing those who are not. In addition, current employees should be given remedial education to prepare them for annual抽考. Last winter, the考銓会议 was convened in the capital. We have reviewed the resolutions it passed, which are generally aimed at selecting true talent through examinations and avoiding favoritism in appointments. The intention is not bad. The attendees, feeling the difficulty of recruiting talent in remote provinces, also decided on a method for mutual transfer of central and local civil servants, and planned to establish銓叙分機關 in various provinces to facilitate the promotion of銓叙行政, which is especially what we endorse. All of these things make the people of the country optimistic about their success, but we generally hope that after each case is reported to the central government and made into laws, it can be implemented as much as possible so that the foundation of our country's civil service system can be laid and further developed. The Premier said: "If teaching is conducted with the right methods, then there will be no people born in vain; if encouragement is given in the right way, then there will be no talented people suppressed; if appointments are made properly, then there will be no opportunists." The principles of rectifying official governance and cultivating talent, both in ancient and modern times, at home and abroad, are nothing more than this. Once the civil service system can be consolidated and sound, the bad habit of corruption and bribery will no longer be able to exist for long, and the serious problem of youth unemployment can also be largely solved. As for its impact, it will fundamentally change the traditional psychology of ordinary people despising officials, not to mention it.</p>
<p>(3) Our country is still in the period of political tutelage, which everyone knows; and the period of political tutelage, originally set for six years, will expire before March of this year. In view of this, the Legislative Yuan drafted a constitution last year to prepare for it. The final draft of the constitution has been reviewed by the Fifth Plenary Session, and then it is planned to be submitted to the Fifth National Congress, and after being passed by the Fifth National Congress, it will be submitted to the National Assembly in accordance with the law. This is a legal procedure that cannot be disputed. According to the Outline of National Reconstruction stipulated by the Premier, the convocation of the National Assembly and the promulgation of the constitution both depend on the completion of local self-government; and the completion of local self-government depends on the completion of the four major tasks of surveying household registration,清丈土地, establishing security, and opening up transportation. Last winter, Commander-in-Chief Chiang toured ten provinces and cities in Central and North China. After returning, he described his impressions, saying: "All provinces know to pay attention to the implementation of the two items of security and transportation among the four major tasks, and it will not be difficult to assess their effectiveness in the coming years... However, regarding 清丈土地 and surveying household registration, except for Ningxia Province, many are still afraid of difficulties and have not moved forward, not only have they not implemented it, but they have not even started to design it. This should be promoted and implemented as soon as possible to comply with the purpose of political tutelage." All of our countrymen earnestly hope that the national reconstruction program personally ordered by the Premier can be implemented step by step in the shortest possible time; but today, the opportunity for constitutional government is still far away, which cannot be denied. It is also undesirable to blindly advance regardless of reality. I still remember that the newly appointed Chief Justice Wang Yongbin expressed his opinion on the initial draft of the constitution, saying: "If the people are not trained and self-governance is not prepared, then once political tutelage and constitutional government are completed on the same day, there will be many theoretical and practical difficulties." We also believe that although the Third Plenary Session has resolved that March of this year is the date for the promulgation of the constitution, this point has been disallowed by the facts, so we can only actively train the masses in self-governance and implement the four major tasks during the transitional period between political tutelage and constitutional government. Among the four major tasks, 清丈土地 is the most urgent task at present, and the difficulty of its work is also recognized by discerning people. In the future, if we must move forward step by step in 清丈, it will be difficult to achieve quick results. At the very least, we must first conduct "查丈", or land reporting, because after "查丈" is completed, it can not only be used to verify the existing fish scale registers, which is of great benefit to the reorganization of field taxes, but also serve as a necessary preliminary work for future 清丈. The financial meeting in May last year also paid attention to this, considering it the most important facility during the period of political tutelage, which must not be perfunctorily delayed.</p>
<p>The promotion of political tutelage is originally aimed at "guiding the people to accept training in the use of the four powers, and guiding the people to strive to complete the prerequisites necessary for local self-government." Therefore, after drafting the constitution, the Legislative Yuan also issued a draft law on county and city self-government and drafted a law on the exercise of the four powers of the people. Commander-in-Chief Chiang recently ordered the counties in the bandit-suppression provinces to be reorganized into districts, in order to establish a foundation for promoting political tutelage and establishing constitutional government, and his intention is even more obvious. However, the focus of the problem today is not on how to establish good laws, but on how to promote the spirit of the rule of law and how to consolidate the foundation of the rule of law. We firmly believe that at this unprecedented moment of national crisis, the people of the country, unless they are insane, all wish to fight together with the central government and unite against foreign aggression. The central government is as eager for good governance as the people, and it should be able to promote the spirit of the rule of law, consolidate the foundation of the rule of law, so that the transitional period between political tutelage and constitutional government can be shortened as much as possible, and the Premier's program of national reconstruction can be completed as soon as possible. Therefore, we dare to reveal the three major points of rectifying domestic affairs, and encourage all parties in the country to work together.</p>

<p>The Shen Bao Yearbook of the 24th Year of the Republic of China</p>
<p>— Zhang Zisheng</p>
<p>Striving for Academic Reference by Focusing on "New," "Precise," and "Accurate"</p>
<p>Collecting Political, Economic, Cultural, and Social Survey Materials to Suit the Application of All Sectors</p>
<p>(1) Modern Life and Yearbooks The increasing modernization of Chinese national life is a clearly established fact, requiring no further explanation. Modern life, whether for individual livelihoods or collective activities, is inherently related to all aspects that are currently being promoted and transformed. The advantage is the richness of life's content; the difficulty that it makes people feel is the complexity of its relationship with all aspects. In this, the understanding of current affairs and the possession of various practical knowledge are increasingly needed in the lives of people from all walks of life in China. Publications that respond to this need and are increasingly developed are daily newspapers and various regularly published magazines; those that surpass the role of daily newspapers and magazines and rise as a new force are yearbooks. Generally speaking, yearbooks comprehensively review the progress of activities in various fields over the past year and compile various statistical survey materials into one volume. Its function has progressed from fragmented reports and discussions to a complete and systematic offering; its convenience lies in relieving people of the burden of searching and the hassle of purchasing separately, and when needed, they can refer to and check in one volume, and get a rough idea. Mr. Zhang Yunhe, the chief writer of this newspaper, described the purpose of Mr. Shi, the former general manager, in publishing the Shen Bao Yearbook, saying</p>
<p>...Even if people have extremely strong memory, how can they store millions of things from the past year in their minds, understand and integrate them, and never forget them. The yearbook is to comb and sort out what has been gained in the past year, and replace people from all walks of life in their minds, to remember things that cannot be remembered, and to leave impressions that cannot be left. Then, how can the making of yearbooks be done by oneself?</p>
<p>The benefits of yearbooks can be roughly seen here. Furthermore, people today, whether engaged in politics, law enforcement, academic research, or managing agriculture, industry, and commerce, are all suffering from the complexity of their relationships with various aspects. Yearbooks contribute orderly practical materials to them; they all feel that it is not easy to understand various activities and phenomena that are not their own specialty, and yearbooks systematically compile various real situations for their reference.</p>
<p>Since people today have no way to turn back time and live a life that is "unrelated to the world," and they feel that the promotion and evolution of world affairs are too complex, the comprehensive reports of yearbooks are inevitably needed.</p>
<p>(2) The Contribution of the Two Published Shen Bao Yearbooks The earliest publications of Chinese yearbooks were by foreign organizations that wanted to understand the Chinese situation: the "China Yearbook" of the East Asia Tongwen Society's Survey Department of Japan had already reached its third edition in the seventh year of the Republic of China; the English "China Yearbook" was also published annually by the North China Daily News. The "First China Yearbook" published by the Commercial Press in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China was the beginning of ordinary yearbooks compiled by Chinese people themselves. However, its sequel has not been printed for a long time, so academics who want to refer to various practical materials still have to draw materials from foreign countries, and the general public has no way to understand the situation in various aspects of their own country in a simple way. Twenty-one years was the 60th anniversary of the founding of Shen Bao. Mr. Shi Liangcai, the owner of the museum, added a yearbook society to the museum to complement the daily newspaper and monthly magazine, and to complete the mission of running a newspaper business. I was invited to preside over the editing. Zhang Jun Zhuohan, an important colleague in the company, was the editor of the first China Yearbook of the Commercial Press; Sun Jun Huiren usually paid attention to the collection of materials, and had his own strengths in experience and knowledge; Chen Jun Ziya, on the other hand, ran around soliciting materials from all parties. Thanks to the awards and assistance from all parties in the country, and the cooperation of experts and scholars, the first yearbook was published in April of the twenty-second year. Based on the opinions of critics and the opinions of readers, and widely inviting the guidance and cooperation of experts in various fields, the first yearbook was thoroughly revised, and the second Shen Bao Yearbook was published in April of the twenty-third year.</p>
<p>As the chief editor of the Shen Bao Yearbook, I dare not boast about its achievements here, and the success of the two yearbooks should be attributed to the enthusiastic assistance of those who provided materials and participated in the drafting. However, in terms of the two published books, they cannot be said to have made no contribution to the Chinese people: (1) People who check practical materials do not have to take materials from foreign yearbooks. Because the editing of the Shen Bao Yearbook is very diligent in referring to and collecting information in advance, and the consultation is also very conscientious, it is not only newer but also more accurate, which can be seen from the frequent citations by writers. (2) The practical reference of people from all walks of life is slightly facilitated. Because the scope of the Shen Bao Yearbook is very wide, all materials on the country's land, population, climate, as well as politics, law, economics (including finance, transportation, and industry), national defense, and culture, education, social conditions, world overview, and daily convenience, are fairly complete. We often receive letters or phone calls from people in political, academic, commercial, and industrial circles to consult with us, and we are very happy that people from all walks of life do not see it as a rigid model, which also shows that there are many people who use the Shen Bao Yearbook for practical checks. (3) Correction of various erroneous records. Various records currently in use in China inevitably have errors that are passed down. The records selected in the first Shen Bao Yearbook were reviewed by experts, and in the second book, they were either corrected and published, or no longer used. For example, the revision of the "Table of Existing Railway Miles in Various Provinces," the correction of the Xiamen Concession and the text on the Yunnan border area, are the most notable. (4) Introduction of important materials. Mr. Zeng Shiying's newly made "Table of Land Area of Various Provinces and Regions in the Country," Mr. Weng Wenhao's "Examination and Correction of Chinese Mountains," and Mr. Zhu Kezhen's "Theory of Chinese Climate Zones" are all new documents of great value in academic and practical terms. The Shen Bao Yearbook specially selected and published them, on the one hand, so that checkers can avoid being misled by old theories, and on the other hand, so that these documents can come into contact with buyers and users, and we are confident that it can increase their effectiveness.</p>
<p>(3) Improvements in the Editing of the New Yearbook Since the Shen Bao Yearbook has been favored by the Chinese people, and its sales have spread throughout the country, and users are popular in all sectors, the editors and special writers each know how to encourage themselves, in order to not fail the expectations of the Chinese people. The editorial policy that has always been described to seek advice from all parties: (1) To collect a wide range of materials to adapt to the different checks of those whose reference purposes are different; (2) To gather the contributions of various experts, cooperate in division of labor, and organize various materials with specialized properties, in order to make the content more and more accurate; (3) To seek the convenience of all of you in practical use, whether the distribution of all materials in various categories is appropriate or not, after repeated consideration by the colleagues in the company, we feel that there are still inappropriate things, so we send letters to ask for advice from specialists and the many who have purchased and used the Shen Bao Yearbook; We strive to enable people from all walks of life to obtain a certain item of material in less time.</p>
<p>The colleagues still think that the above editorial policy is roughly unchanged, but because of the experience of the two editions, we know where to focus our efforts, and now the points we are focusing on: —</p>
<p>First, to seek newness. Everyone with knowledge knows that it is impossible to edit a yearbook and conduct direct surveys by oneself, and to make various statistics by oneself. When adopting existing materials, there are also those who feel that they are too old and inapplicable. We are now implementing indirect surveys through communication. For example, we are cooperating with the Zhejiang Library to investigate libraries across the country, cooperating with a quality survey institute to investigate major mining companies across the country, and the survey of civil affairs and justice is in progress.</p>
<p>Second, to seek precision. It is not what the colleagues want to do to compile materials made of clippings and miscellaneous records, to make a huge volume, and to publish it sloppily. In the previous two books, we also slightly focused on this, and we know how to do our best. After reviewing what we have done, we also feel that some parts need to be more precise. What we can now describe is, for example, that we have changed the industrial compilation and asked the gentlemen of the China Economic Statistics Survey Institute to compile it, and the description of the drought in the twenty-third year in the climate compilation. We have specially asked Mr. Zhu Binghai of the Meteorological Research Institute to write the manuscript, which is an example of this.</p>
<p>Third, to seek accuracy. Whether the various survey statistics records are accurate or not originally only has a comparative standard, and cannot be absolutely determined. Although we dare not say that the content of the Shen Bao Yearbook is completely error-free, most of the suppliers of various materials and special writers are specialized researchers or professional service personnel, who usually have close contact with the materials they contribute. Their ability to seek accuracy should be trusted by the Chinese people. In the future, we will work harder on the word "accurate," and hope that the degree of accuracy of this book will increase with each year, so that the practical materials obtained by Chinese people who purchase and use it are credible and verifiable.</p>
<p>(4) What We Ask of All Parties Since the Shen Bao Yearbook is popular throughout the country and is used by all sectors, its improvement, in addition to the editors and writers doing their best, must also seek the assistance of all parties throughout the country. We now ask: First, various academic institutions and specialized researchers to give us closer cooperation; Second, various institutions and groups to send us more applicable materials; Third, critics and the many who have purchased and used the yearbook, to give us appropriate guidance.</p>

<p>Special Telecommunications Issue</p>
<p>The Voice of the Telecommunications Industry</p>
<h3>New Year's Greetings</h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>Time flies like an arrow; in the blink of an eye, we have reached the new year of the Republic of China, year twenty-four. Leaving behind the old and ushering in the new, this time of year naturally brings a new atmosphere to society, and the people of the nation hold new hopes. This publication is no exception, and as the new year begins, we would like to express what we wish to say.</p>
<p>The progress of the telecommunications industry comes with the needs of society. The more society needs telecommunications, the faster telecommunications will develop. Therefore, the prosperity of society greatly affects the telecommunications industry. In recent years, foreign aggression has brought economic decline, many rural areas have gone bankrupt, and the business world is in a slump. Under such circumstances, even if the telecommunications sector itself does its best to reorganize and build, the increase in business may not meet the authorities' expectations. Therefore, the development of telecommunications truly depends on the improvement of the domestic situation. The past is already history, but we hope that starting this year, the entire nation will cooperate further, society will become more stable, and all industries will gradually become more prosperous. In this way, the telecommunications industry will also see greater expansion. This is our first hope.</p>
<p>In the past year, the various facilities of the telecommunications authorities have been reported in the news, so there is no need to repeat them. Time flies, and there is no end to telecommunications. Measures that have already been determined and began in the past, if they do not need to be continued, should be completed this year. New initiatives for improvement should observe the needs of the industry and aim for active development this year. In particular, it is hoped that the entire telecommunications industry will share the same goals and work together. This is our second hope.</p>
<p>This publication has been in circulation for over a year. Although it has been able to meet readers' expectations to a certain extent, it cannot be said to be completely satisfactory. As the new year arrives, our desire for innovation is even stronger. We hope that those outside and within the telecommunications industry will send us new works on telecommunications, striving for them to be insightful and original, not falling into old ways, so that the content of this publication will be more substantial and精彩. This is our third hope.</p>
<p>New Year, New Year, filled with many new hopes. To realize these hopes, continuous effort is essential. The year has begun, and the scenery is greatly renewed. We respectfully wish progress to all sectors and look forward to their efforts in the new year!</p>
<h3>The New Spirit of the Telecommunications Industry</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Years pass quickly, and the New Year's Day of the twenty-fourth year is upon us again. New Year's Day is the happiest day of life and the most exciting day of life. Why is it the happiest day? Because we work diligently throughout the year, with no spare time. Some toil physically, engaging in personal careers, while others fret mentally, serving the country. On this New Year's holiday, everyone enjoys themselves, raising glasses to celebrate the year, filled with joy. Why is it the most exciting day? Because our lives are limited, but our careers are endless. In the fleeting decades, besides childhood, old age, and illness, how many days can we work? How many things can we accomplish? Considering the days we can be productive and the bodies we can use, how can we not concentrate our spirits and act swiftly? New Year's Day is the starting point for a year filled with this new spirit, so it is the most exciting day. If individuals can implement this new spirit, what cannot be accomplished? If the nation can implement this new spirit, what enemy cannot be defeated?</p>
<p>Among the Western material civilizations imitated in our country, telegraphy was the earliest, starting with Li Hongzhang's memorial on handling foreign affairs in the fifth year of the Guangxu reign. Over fifty years have passed. Why have we not only failed to keep pace with Europe and America but also become known for corruption? Although it is said to be influenced by the times, it is also due to poor planning. What is poor planning? It is the lack of a new spirit to aid it. Given China's vast area and large population, it is unreasonable to say that there is no need for a telecommunications industry! With the power of the national government above and the economic power of the people below, it is also unbelievable that the telecommunications industry cannot be developed! However, those in charge of telecommunications are either stuck in the past and do not know how to advance, or they fear difficulties and seek only to maintain the status quo, or they rely on politicians and military figures and do not publicly reveal their needs and realities to society, seeking their sympathy and assistance. As for those who use telecommunications as a means to get promoted or get rich, they are even more contemptible. Due to these factors, China's telecommunications industry has stagnated for fifty years, following old ways and declining. "Decades are like one day."</p>
<p>From now on, if there is no new spirit to aid it, who knows if fifty years later, we will not be as we are today?</p>
<p>What is the new spirit? It is the spirit of not avoiding hardship, not minding grievances, having meticulous thinking, and great courage, with career as the premise and service as the goal. The achievements of telecommunications administration in the past year are clearly visible: regarding international communication, there is the opening of the China-UK and China-Japan wireless circuits; regarding domestic communication, there is the construction of remote radio stations such as Kangding and Lhasa, the establishment of fifty-one telegraph offices such as Jiangling and Tai'ning, the organization of combined telegraph and telephone business offices and agencies, the merger of wireless radio, and the success of postal and telecommunications integration. In addition, regarding the determination of organizational systems, the improvement of business regulations, the unification of financial revenue and expenditure, the implementation of engineering plans, the consolidation of telecommunications businesses run by the ministry, provinces, and private enterprises, the recovery of external sovereign interests, the diligence of telecommunications personnel, and the credibility of society, this publication has repeatedly recorded. Society has its own evaluation, so there is no need to elaborate. Some say that the changes in China's telecommunications industry in the past year almost exceed the accumulation of reforms over the past fifty years, which is no exaggeration. How was this achieved? The new spirit, that's it.</p>
<p>The principle of reversal after extremity is clearly stated in ancient teachings. The revival from decline is a common occurrence. However, it also depends on the spirit of those in charge. If they believe that the career is at its most extreme point of decline and do not think about how to save it, merely pacing back and forth in the courtyard, sighing in the room, then the career will inevitably decline and never recover. If someone emerges, observes the cause of the illness, seeks the way to diagnose it, enthusiastically does it, and resolutely implements it, then its effect will often exceed our expectations. Looking at China's telecommunications in the past two years or several years ago, it was bound by unequal treaties externally and ravaged by natural disasters and bandits internally, with accumulated causes of corruption and a fragmented situation. Who would not be infinitely pessimistic and believe that it was beyond salvation? However, the telecommunications industry in the past year, after the authorities' combing, weeding, supporting, and reorganizing, has proven to be a complete success. This is the power of the new spirit.</p>
<p>However, if it is said that the telecommunications industry has done its best in reorganization in the past year and has reached the peak of development, who would dare to believe it? Not only is it unable to compare with Europe and America, but it is also inferior to Japan. Not only has Director-General's plan to build wired and wireless circuits not been realized, but the improvement of existing局　　　must also be doubled. Moreover, the international situation is often tense, the national economy is in dire straits, politics still needs to be clarified, and the communist bandits have long been condemned by Heaven. All these facts are indirectly and directly related to telecommunications. Fortunately, the transportation authorities will never be satisfied with the status quo and will never be afraid of the adverse environment. The past has become history, and there must be new initiatives in the new year. Let us wait and see.</p>
<p>At this New Year's Day, we should have an extremely happy view, make the greatest determination, have unlimited hope, implement the new spirit of the individual, and serve the country and society. At the same time, we should support the government's new spirit, develop state-owned enterprises, not be pessimistic, not be impetuous, always persevere, and be resolute in dealing with things. The final victory belongs to us. As the ancients said, "The plan for the year lies in spring." Please start from now.</p>
<h3>International Radio Stations in the Coming Year</h3>
<p>— Zhang Chenghu</p>
<p>In the New Year's Day supplement last year, there was an article titled "A Glimpse of International Radio Stations," which detailed the construction of international radio stations by the transportation authorities, as well as the existing equipment and business conditions. Time passes easily, and another year has passed. The efforts of our transportation authorities in construction have not slackened at all during this year. Therefore, the development process of our country's only external　　　speaking international radio station during the year should also be a concern for all interested parties. Therefore, I will describe its equipment, business, and other items separately as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Expanding Equipment</p>
<p>To achieve the development of wireless telecommunications business, it depends on accurate and fast communication. The accuracy and speed of communication depend on complete and thorough equipment. "Good tools make good work" is an ancient saying. The International Radio Station has been established for four years, and its scale is roughly complete. In order to improve business and meet needs, the equipment has been expanded every year. The following were completed within the past year:</p>
<p>(Marconi Machine) This machine began to be installed in January of the 22nd year of the Republic of China and was completed in February of the 23rd year. It includes two 20-kilowatt shortwave transmitters, with two sets of beam antennas for Europe and one set of beam antennas for the United States. There are also four shortwave receivers, with three sets of beam antennas for Europe and two sets of beam antennas for the United States. Since the completion of the machine, the machine distribution and wavelength changes of the European and American communication lines can be easily handled.</p>
<p>(Armored Underground Cable) The transmitting station of the International Radio Station is located in Zhenru, Shanghai, the receiving station is located in Liuhang, Baoshan, and the central control is located in the Sassoon Building on Renji Road, Public Concession, Shanghai. The connection between the three locations depends on remote control lines. The original remote control lines of the station were overhead cables and copper bare wires, which were prone to theft, insect bites, wind damage, and fire damage, causing many obstacles. For the purpose of fundamental relief, a 50-pair armored underground cable was added, starting from the wiring room south of Hengfeng Bridge. It passes through Hengfeng Road, Datong Road, Jiaotong Road, and Taopu West Road in Zhabei, and reaches the Zhenru transmitting station; then from the transmitting station through Zhenda Road, Hutai Road, and Baoshan County Road, it reaches the Liuhang by-reporting station. The entire line is 42.87 li long, and five test line boxes are set up along the line. It began to be used in January of the 23rd year. The original overhead cables are still reserved for occasional needs, so the remote control lines of the International Station are in no danger of being interrupted.</p>
<p>(Zhenru Power Plant) The power supply for the Zhenru transmitting station was supplied by the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company. Its power supply lines were very long and prone to obstruction. For the sake of safety, a standby power plant was self-equipped in the station, with a 600-horsepower diesel engine as the prime mover, and a power generation capacity of 400 kilowatts, which was sufficient for the entire station. The project was completed in February of the 23rd year. Since then, whenever the city power is cut off, the machine can be started for power supply immediately, so there is no need to worry about affecting the telegraph service.</p>
<p>(Liuhang Transformer Station) The Liuhang receiving station was originally located in a remote rural area and could not purchase city power, so it set up its own power plant to meet its needs. In the spring of the 23rd year, the Dachang Dayao Electric Company purchased power from the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to supply residents in the area. The station took the opportunity to contact the company, borrowed capital, extended the power supply line to the Liuhang receiving station, and installed a 50-kilowatt, 6,600-volt to 380-volt, three-transformer station in the station. It was completed and commissioned in July, and Liuhang Electric Economy also has the dual protection of city power and self-provided power.</p>
<p>(Repair Shop) The International Station was still in its initial stage of establishment, and there were no factory equipment. The repair and replacement of machine parts was very inconvenient. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications decided to attach a repair shop to the Zhenru transmitting station of the station, equipped with lathes, drilling machines, planers, and all hand tools. It was installed and completed in March of the 23rd year. If the transmitting and receiving machine parts of the station are damaged, they will be repaired immediately, and the necessary replacement parts will be fully prepared; and in their spare time, they will engage in the manufacture of wireless machine parts for the use of radio stations throughout the country.</p>
<p>(Dedicated Line Exchange) For merchants and people to use telegraphs, speed is the first need, and the financial industry is even more so. The International Radio Station has dedicated lines connected to various banks and stockbrokers. Their telegraphs are sent and received through this dedicated line, using telephones or teletypewriters to transmit to each other. The delivery rate is doubled, and merchants and people are happy to use this dedicated line more and more. In order to meet the needs, the station successively installed two dedicated line exchanges in September and November of the 22nd year, which can accommodate 50 dedicated lines for telephones and teletypewriters each. Shanghai merchants who wish to send and receive telegraphs particularly quickly can contact the station to lease them.</p>
<p>(Relay Fast Machine) Relay refers to domestic telegrams being relayed through Shanghai to foreign countries, or foreign telegrams being relayed through Shanghai to the interior. The domestic part of handling this telegram is the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, and the foreign part is the International Radio Station. Therefore, there should be close and fast communication between the International and Shanghai Telegraph Bureaus. In view of this, the Ministry of Communications has specially prepared a Creed automatic sending and receiving fast machine for the bureau to handle relay reporting, which was also put into use in September of the 23rd year.</p>
<p>The above items are the new constructions completed by the International Radio Station in the 23rd year of the Republic of China. There are also noteworthy expansion equipment under construction as follows:</p>
<p>(Expansion of Central Control Room) The central control room is the central hub for sending and receiving telecommunications, and its responsibility is respectful and important. It should naturally expand with business needs. The central room of the International Station, located in the Sassoon Building, occupies about 2,000 square feet. Recently, due to the increasing number of reports, it is not enough to apply, so it was decided to expand the location by one time, adding sending and receiving tables, and dividing them into east and west parts with the original ones. The current report table has been arranged, and the application machine parts, such as automatic transmitters, wave wringing machines, paper pulling machines,　孔 machines, amplifiers, and time printing machines. They are purchased by the Ministry of Communications from the station itself or purchased by the material procurement committee. After completion, it can form 15 receiving positions and 9 sending positions, and allocate the American and European communication lines to the east and west parts, and the receiving and sending efficiency can be doubled.</p>
<p>(Adding Transmitters) The Zhenru transmitting station has added a 20 to 40 kilowatt shortwave transmitter. The internal installation has already　, but the antenna has not been completed yet. It can be tested around the middle of this month.</p>
<p>(Expanding Receiving Station) A new battery room has been built in the Liuhang receiving station, and the relocation of new and old batteries and charging boards is underway. The original battery location was converted into a receiver room, adding a diversity receiver and two sets of antennas for Europe and the United States, so that the diversity receiving method can be used to eliminate the drawbacks of shortwave fading. This project is expected to be completed around February of this year.</p>
<p>(Adding Wireless Telephone Equipment) Wireless telephones have made special progress in recent years, and European and American countries have successively adopted them as international communication weapons. My country's International Radio Station is catching up and is also proceeding to add wireless telephone equipment. The Ministry of Communications ordered receiving, transmitting, and control machines from the British Standard Electric Company in the autumn of the 22nd year of the Republic of China and allocated them to the International Radio Station for application. Although the machines have not yet arrived at the station, the machine installation location and antenna foundation have been surveyed and determined. As soon as the machines arrive, they can be installed and used.</p>
<p>(Purchase Standard Wave Meters) The wireless radio business is becoming more and more developed, the space electromagnetic waves are becoming more and more numerous, and mutual interference is also becoming more and more serious. The previous Madrid International Telecommunications Conference decided that the frequency of the electromagnetic waves emitted by each radio station should not differ by more than five ten-thousandths from the specified one and enforce it. International communication agencies must purchase extremely accurate standard wave meters. To test the frequency of the electromagnetic waves they emit and correct them from time to time. The International Radio Station has never had this equipment. Whenever electromagnetic waves interfere, it does not know which is right and wrong. Even if others falsely claim that the electromagnetic waves emitted by the International Radio Station are inaccurate, there is no way to test and defend it, so it can only swallow its anger and default. The Ministry of Communications has purchased a standard wave meter from the United States and ordered it to be allocated to the station, which will be installed in the Liuhang receiving station immediately, so that it can receive any electromagnetic waves from around the world and test them. It is not only for measuring the electromagnetic waves emitted by the station itself. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Telegraphs and the New Year</h3>
<p>— Baozhen</p>
<p>The wheels of time are constantly moving forward, and the annual New Year has come to the world. People are driven by life and inevitably leave their hometowns to live in other places. Therefore, people in their hometowns, when they encounter the New Year festival, cannot help but miss their relatives and friends who are far away from their hometowns. Of course, travelers living in other places also miss their elders or other relatives and friends in their hometowns. Therefore, social customs often involve sending New Year greeting cards during the New Year season, partly to reciprocate politeness and partly to communicate. However, my country has a vast territory, and it takes more than a day or two for mail to reach its destination in distant places. Suppose a New Year greeting card is sent from Shanghai to a friend in Beiping on New Year's Day. It may take four or five days to reach the destination. After receiving the greeting card, the friend in Beiping, even if he replies immediately, will take another four or five days to reach Shanghai. This back and forth will take at least eight or nine days, and the New Year season is almost over. There are direct trains between Shanghai and Beiping, and transportation cannot be considered inconvenient. Then, in places where transportation is inconvenient, wouldn't it be ineffective to exchange greeting cards? How can we remedy this shortcoming? I dare to responsibly introduce only one method of using social telegraphs. No matter what place in the country, it can be sent and received immediately, and it will never delay your affairs. When relatives and friends receive a beautiful New Year telegram, they will of course reply with a telegram immediately, and they can receive it on the same day. Thousands of miles away, it is no different from meeting face to face. Therefore, if we use telegrams to wish our relatives and friends a Happy New Year, we will surely make them feel happy in spirit.</p>
<p>Every time the political and military circles of our country send telegrams to superiors or colleagues during the New Year, they often abuse official telegrams with printed telegram paper because they do not understand the regulations of the telegraph bureau. However, since New Year telegrams are of a private social nature, according to the revised regulations on charging and restricting official military telegrams, they cannot be sent as official telegrams. When the telegraph bureau encounters such official telegrams that do not comply with the regulations, they will be treated as official telegrams for private matters and detained. Moreover, recently, the responsible leaders of political and military agencies have expressed their deep sympathy for the Ministry of Communications' measures to crack down on official telegrams for private matters. It is reported that a staff member of the Political Training Office of a certain division, Li, was dismissed by the Military Commission for using the division's printed telegram paper to send private telegrams. Therefore, if public officials of political and military agencies want to send telegrams to their superiors or colleagues to congratulate them on the New Year or promotion, do not violate the regulations and send official telegrams, which may be detained in the middle, or even dismissed for this reason. You can send social telegrams in accordance with the regulations, which is not only legal but also avoids the risk of being detained. Isn't it killing two birds with one stone? Moreover, the price of social telegrams is low. No matter where in the country, whether in the same province or another province, each Chinese character costs only two cents, which is three cents less than the five cents per character for official telegrams. Isn't it even cheaper?</p>
<p>If the name of the recipient of a Chinese social telegram is within two characters and the name of the receiving location is within 15 characters, it can also be calculated as five characters according to the new provincial fee regulations. For example, the telegram "Wang Junnian, No. 1087, Yian Lane, Albert Road, Shanghai - I sincerely wish my brother a prosperous future in the New Year" is charged only for 20 characters, which only needs to pay 40 cents, which can be said to be extremely low. During this New Year festival, for ladies and gentlemen from all walks of life who want to send New Year greetings to relatives and friends in distant places, only this cheap and good-quality social telegram can satisfy you.</p>
<h3>Explanation of Telegraph Terminology (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Qinghua</p>
<p>Various telegraph regulations and articles in this publication often use telegraph terminology. Those in the know can understand it at a glance, without any difficulty. However, those outside the industry often find the meaning unclear and difficult to understand. Therefore, I will continue to annotate the commonly used terms below:</p>
<p>Telecommunications: The abbreviation for telegraph is "telegram," and the abbreviation for telephone is "telephone." The term "telecommunications" is a collective term for telegraphs and telephones. Whether wired or wireless telegraphs, local or long-distance telephones, as well as facsimile telegrams, broadcasting, and wireless radio, all refer to "telecommunications." When we say telecommunications industry, it includes all the above-mentioned electrical communication businesses.</p>
<p>Incoming Telegram: It is the telegram sent, that is, the telegram received by the recipient.</p>
<p>Outgoing Telegram: It is the telegram sent out, that is, the telegram delivered by the sender.</p>
<p>Relay Telegram: It is the telegram relayed by the intermediate telegraph bureau.</p>
<p>Telegram Base: It is the telegram paper with the telegram text written on it. The outgoing telegram base is the telegram base originally written by the sender, the incoming telegram base is the telegram base sent by the receiving bureau to the recipient, and the relay telegram base is the telegram base copied by the telegraph bureau when relaying. Telegram bases are also divided into original telegram bases and copied telegram bases. The original telegram base is the original telegram base, and the copied telegram base is the telegram base copied according to the original base, only for reference.</p>
<p>Telegram Fee: It is the telegraph fee.</p>
<p>Telephone Fee: Telephone fees are divided into monthly rent (or quarterly rent) and long-distance. The telephone fee paid monthly for local telephones is called the monthly rent telephone fee, and the call fee for each long-distance telephone call is called the long-distance telephone fee.</p>
<p>Connection Fee: If a long-distance telephone call is connected to another company or telephone bureau's local telephone, a connection fee must be charged separately. For example, in the past, when Shanghai's Chinese boundary connected with the concession, the concession telephone company had to charge a connection fee of five cents each time. (Note: It is now free of charge, and the Ministry of Communications provides subsidies).</p>
<p>Line Fee: If a long-distance telephone call passes through the telephone lines of more than two telephone bureaus or companies, in addition to the call fee for the line of the local bureau, the line fee of other companies must also be paid, which is briefly referred to as the line fee. The price of ordinary long-distance telephone calls is calculated by combining various fees and is not collected separately.</p>
<p>Copying Fee: If there are more than two recipients of a telegram in the same location, only one telegram needs to be sent, with the additional payment mark of "distributed copy" or "TMX." When the telegraph bureau receives the telegram, it will copy several copies and send them to each recipient. For this additional copying procedure, for each telegram that does not exceed 50 characters, each additional copy (that is, there are two recipients) will be charged a "copying fee" of 20 cents. For those exceeding 50 but not exceeding 100 characters, the fee will be doubled, and so on. (The distributed copying fee for social telegrams is only 10 cents for every 50 characters.)</p>
<p>Translation Fee: For outgoing Chinese clear text telegrams that are translated into code by the telegraph bureau, an additional "translation fee" of one cent per character will be charged. There is no translation fee for incoming telegrams.</p>
<p>Special Labor Fee: If the recipient lives in a township or on a ship with no telegraph bureau, and the telegraph bureau must send a special messenger to deliver the telegram, a "special labor fee" should be charged. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Modernization of Telegraph New Year Greetings</h3>
<p>— Zhongming</p>
<p>Today is New Year's Day of the twenty-fourth year. On this New Year's Day, people from all walks of life are busy celebrating the New Year and wishing each other well. Speaking of the methods of New Year greetings, they are also changing with each passing day, following the evolution of the times. The various New Year greeting methods that were popular in the past have gradually become outdated and are not suitable for this modern trend. The giant wave of the times has dispersed all the old and promoted the new, and New Year greeting telegrams are the latest social communication tool promoted by this giant wave.</p>
<p>Telegraph New Year greetings have long been popular in European and American countries. Its scope is not limited to relatives and friends. Even if an ordinary person does not know the head of state or local officials, they often send telegrams to congratulate them on Christmas or New Year's Day. This is a kind of salute from the European and American people to the head of state or officials. In the past, telegraph bureaus in various places in our country also opened New Year greeting telegrams at the end of the year, but because the telegram fees were not very low, they could not be promoted. Since the implementation of the social telegram method last year, the telegram fees have been greatly reduced, and the price per character in Chinese only costs two cents. Therefore, the public enthusiastically used this brand new modern New Year greeting method. It is said that last year, the income from social telegrams in various telegraph bureaus was considerable, and most of them were of a New Year greeting nature. This shows the public's welcome of New Year greeting telegrams!</p>
<p>However, the public's welcome did not come by chance. There are two major meanings between them: First, in recent years, everything has been about modernization and economization. Anything that can meet these conditions can　be welcomed and become popular. People are tired of the old-fashioned New Year greeting methods and always want to change their taste, but they don't want to spend too much money and the method is new. Under this circumstance, telegraph New Year greetings have undoubtedly become popular for a while!</p>
<p>Secondly! Anything that is too common is often not valued. The same is true of New Year greetings. If the method we use is too common, it will naturally not attract the attention of relatives and friends, or even be considered lacking in sincerity and respect. Of course, we want our New Year greetings to be sincere and respectful so that the other party has a deep impression and achieves the practical effect of contacting friendship. Among all the New Year greeting methods, the most sincere and respectful, and the most attractive, I think nothing is better than telegrams!</p>
<p>Regarding New Year greeting telegrams, there are two more points worth noting to everyone: I heard that this year, in order to reward the social people for using telegrams to celebrate the New Year, each telegraph bureau has specially prepared a large number of colorful and exquisitely printed New Year telegram envelopes, printed with beautiful pictures drawn by artists. In this way, when your relatives and friends receive the New Year telegram, they will be very happy to see this beautiful picture. As for the delivery time of New Year greeting telegrams, there are also restrictions. They are not delivered before 8:00 am and after 8:00 pm to avoid disturbing your relatives and friends. The giant wheels of the times are constantly moving forward. It is expected that this year, the number of New Year greeting telegrams will be more enthusiastic than last year!</p>
<h3>Summary of China's Economy in 1934</h3>
<p>— Feng Weiqi</p>
<p>The Chinese economy in 1934 continued the decline of 1933 and even deepened it. In the world, because of the imperialists' frenzied war preparations, military industries expanded extremely, and related industries recovered to some extent, creating a false prosperity. However, in China, even this false prosperity was absent. Agriculture, industry, and commerce all showed extreme decline.</p>
<p>Now, we will briefly list and describe the important facts that characterized the Chinese economy this year:</p>
<p>1.  Rural Economy Further Declines Due to Disasters</p>
<p>Since the invasion of imperialist forces, China's rural economy has been in a process of collapse and decay. Combined with years of war, famine, banditry, heavy taxes, the seizure of territory, and the shrinking domestic market, this has accelerated the process of collapse and decay. Although there were successive good harvests last year and the year before, these occurred during the deepening of the global economic depression, coupled with China's inconvenient transportation and the exploitation and monopoly of high-interest loans in urban and rural areas. Consequently, not only could the peasants' distress not be alleviated and the rural economy not be revived, but the harmful phenomenon of low grain prices hurting farmers occurred. This year, because more than ten provinces and regions across the country suffered from drought and flood, agricultural yields were sharply reduced. According to estimates by the Central Agricultural Experiment Station of the Ministry of Industry, the national average yield of summer crops this year was only 60% to 65% of the normal annual yield. Specifically, early indica rice was 60%, glutinous rice 58%, millet 64%, proso millet 62%, corn 61%, soybeans 56%, sweet potatoes 63%, peanuts 62%, sesame 59%, and tobacco 62%. The value of the losses, according to the same institute's survey, in the ten provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hebei, Shandong, Hunan, Shaanxi, Henan, Hubei, and Jiangxi alone reached 1.445 billion yuan, and this does not include indirect losses. The institute's already published figures for the disaster-affected fields and total value of crop losses in the six provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hebei, Shandong, and Hunan are listed below:</p>
<p>Disaster-Affected Fields　Total Value of Crop Losses</p>
<p>Jiangsu　　49,455,000 mu　　218,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>Zhejiang　　21,790,000 mu　　164,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>Anhui　　37,027,000 mu　　346,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>Hebei　　57,361,579 mu　　239,548,791 yuan</p>
<p>Shandong　　48,094,477 mu　　150,615,695 yuan</p>
<p>Hunan　　22,389,000 mu　　182,521,892 yuan</p>
<p>Total　　236,117,056 mu　　1,300,686,378 yuan</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be seen that the most severely affected provinces were Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Hunan, which are the most productive rice-growing regions. In recent years, Chinese farmers have been hovering on the brink of starvation due to the long-standing bankruptcy of the rural economy. Even the good harvests of last year and the year before still saw the import of large quantities of grain. How much more serious is this year's drought, which is the worst in sixty years? Therefore, as soon as the disaster struck, calls for relief echoed across the country, and grain prices in various places rose in unison. In Shanghai, for example, the weekly price of japonica rice rose from a high of 9.75 yuan between October 16th and 22nd last year to a high of 14.10 yuan between August 16th and 23rd this year, a difference of nearly 4.50 yuan. Even after the new rice came on the market, it remained around 13 yuan. The weekly rice prices in mid-August of this year and the same period last year are listed below for comparison.</p>
<p>Date　　　Japonica Rice　　Indica Rice　　Glutinous Rice</p>

<p>August 28th to September 3rd Highest 8.70 yuan　Lowest 8.45 yuan　Highest 7.20 yuan　Lowest 7.10 yuanHighest 8.35 yuan　Lowest 8.20 yuan</p>
<p>The high price of grain has left disaster victims with no means of livelihood, leading to a wave of rice riots. According to incomplete statistics from various newspapers, the following table shows just the incidents that occurred in July and August:</p>

<p>With poor harvests, insufficient grain, and high grain prices, it goes without saying that large quantities of foreign wheat flour must be imported to make up the difference. The figures for the fourth quarter of this year are naturally unknown because they have not yet been published. However, the third quarter saw a sharp increase compared to the first and second quarters, which explains this situation. However, if we look at the total import value for the three quarters, 4,163,711 yuan, it is still 74,600,099 yuan lower than last year, about 59% (of which the quantity of rice decreased by 40.6% and the value decreased by 60%, while the quantity and value of wheat decreased by 63.9%). What is the reason for this? Regarding this point, it is impossible to explain if we ignore the sharp decline in the purchasing power of farmers after the disaster, or even their inability to purchase anything, and the nominal nature of relief efforts.</p>
<p>Amidst the widespread reports of drought and flood damage to crops and resulting poor harvests, the only somewhat satisfactory news is that, according to the second estimate by the China Cotton Industry Statistics Association, the lint cotton production is 11,172,553 dan, an increase of 1,398,346 dan compared to last year's final revised estimate of 9,774,207 dan. Although this year's cotton field area of 44,807,579 mu is an increase of 4,353,556 mu compared to last year's final revised estimate of 40,454,023 mu, the percentage increase in cotton field area is only 10.74%, while the percentage increase in lint cotton production is 14.32%, so the average yield per mu has actually increased (0.7 jin). If there had been no drought and flood, the yield would undoubtedly have increased even more.</p>
<p>In addition to the aforementioned drought and flood disasters, the main factors contributing to the collapse of China's rural economy this year include the deepening of the global economic depression, which has led to the continued exclusion of Chinese agricultural products from the world market (such as Chinese tea being squeezed out by Indian, Sri Lankan, and Japanese tea, Chinese silk being squeezed out by Japanese silk and rayon, and the repeated increases in tariffs by countries such as the UK, the US, and France to prevent the import of Chinese egg products), and the US implementation of the Silver Purchase Act, which has absorbed Chinese silver reserves and further dried up rural finance. Also, the large-scale import and dumping of agricultural products from various countries, the intensified exploitation by local gentry, landlords, and moneylenders, and the heavy burden of miscellaneous taxes cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>2.  Weak Rural Purchasing Power Leads to Further Industrial Decline</p>
<p>Needless to say, China's industry is also in decline, like agriculture, and its decline has a long history. The reasons for this decline are nothing more than the following: (1) dumping of foreign goods, making domestic goods unable to compete, and domestic and foreign markets almost completely seized; (2) bankruptcy of the rural economy, resulting in weak purchasing power of the people; (3) domestic politics not yet on the right track, and insufficient government protection; (4) too little capital, lack of cooperation from the financial sector, backward technology, difficulty in development, and ease of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>In recent years, although various sectors have emulated Europe and the United States by adopting economic nationalism and making every effort to promote domestic goods, the results have been limited. Therefore, China's industry in 1934 continued the decline of the previous year and even worsened. Here are some of the main types of industries discussed separately:</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Industry The decline of the cotton yarn industry can be seen from the suspension of work, reduction of work hours, decline in production, sluggish yarn sales, and low yarn prices. According to reports, in the first half of this year, 11 factories with 340,000 spindles completely stopped production, and 3 factories with 100,000 spindles stopped night shifts, totaling 440,000 spindles, accounting for about 15% of the total number of spindles in Chinese factories. This does not include those who shortened working hours (working five or six days per pay period). Therefore, even if the national yarn factory's reduction rate in the first half of this year was not as high as the well-known 23% reduction in the first half of last year (last year, 12 factories with 426,688 spindles completely stopped production in the first half of the year, and 4 factories with 97,288 spindles completely stopped night shifts, totaling about 23% of the national reduction rate, with the number of spindles stopped exceeding half of the total), it is likely not far off. Although factories such as Hankou Zhenhuan Minsheng Yuhua and Zhengzhou Yufeng have successively resumed production in the second half of the year, the number of spindles stopped is certainly no less than one million. The increase in the number of spindles that have stopped production and the reduction in production are undeniable. As for the sluggish yarn sales and low yarn prices, we can get a glimpse from factory-stored cotton yarn and yarn price changes. Shanghai is home to the best-performing yarn factories in the country, but in May 1934, there were still 97,021 bales of yarn stored in factories. Even after the peak sales season of autumn in August, there were still 89,644 bales in stock. Compared to 123,855 bales in June of last year and 123,240 bales in December, there was a slight decrease, but this is the result of years of reduced work and reduced production, and by no means indicates robust yarn sales. Compared to 71,820 bales in December 1932, there is still a difference of more than 17,000 to 25,000 bales. What is happening in Shanghai is indicative of what is happening elsewhere. As for the changes in yarn prices, the following table shows the figures (using 1930 as the base year):</p>
<p>Category　　1932　　1933　　1934 (Three Months in Spring)</p>
<p>42 count Highest price 88 Lowest price 53 57 49 50 49</p>
<p>32 count Highest price 99 Lowest price 71 76 65 66 64</p>
<p>20 count Highest price 98 Lowest price 75 80 67 69 66</p>
<p>16 count Highest price 95 Lowest price 74 78 68 69 66</p>
<p>10 count Highest price 94 Lowest price 81 82 72 70 68</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that although yarn prices have been falling in a straight line, the decrease in stored yarn is minimal. This illustrates that the fall in yarn prices has not helped to shrink the inventory. Therefore, Mr. Li Chongdian, section chief of the Industrial Division of the Ministry of Industry, once said after investigating the three industries of flour, yarn, and silk in Shanghai: "There are more than 30 yarn factories in Shanghai, and each factory is maintaining operations by reducing work hours. Although yarn sales have recently shown slight improvement, and factories that reduced work hours have resumed production one after another, this is temporary in nature, and it is still difficult to profit from the spun yarn." (See Shanghai Zhonghua Daily, October 13).</p>
<p>In addition, we can cite many other facts, such as the grounding of Shenxin and other factories founded by Rong Zongjing, known as the "Cotton Yarn Industry Trust" of China, to prove this, but the above is already quite sufficient, so it is not necessary to do so.</p>
<p>Silk Industry The decline of the silk industry in 1934 was even more severe than that of the cotton yarn industry. According to statistics from the International Trade Bureau, silk sales this year not only showed no improvement, but declined even further. The number of raw silk exports in the three quarters was less than 5,000 piculs, worth only more than 20.5 million yuan, a decrease of more than 50% compared to the same period last year, amounting to 20 million yuan. Silk prices fell from a high standard of over 1,600 taels per picul for Shanghai factories in 1929 to about 400 yuan this year (over 900 yuan per picul in May and June last year, and 500 to 600 yuan per picul in August and September). As a result, silk factories in various places have had to close down one after another. As reported in the Shanghai Zhonghua Daily on October 1, "In the past, there were more than 180 silk factories and more than 40,000 silk reeling machines in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Now, due to the impact of economic decline, only more than 70 factories are operating, with only more than 18,000 silk reeling machines." Furthermore, Shanghai originally had 113 single and double cocoon reeling factories. After the destruction of five factories during the January 28th Shanghai Incident, there were still 108. Last spring, 68 factories勉强 were operating, but this spring that number has further decreased to 33 factories, with a total of over 7,200 reeling machines, and a portion of these are temporary, processing cocoons for customers. But now, even these 30 silk factories that are struggling to operate cannot be sustained, and that number has been reduced to 14. In Shunde, Guangdong, only three factories are operating, and fourteen have closed down. Moreover, most of these silk factories that are struggling to operate only do so intermittently. From this, one can get a glimpse of the decline of the silk industry this year.</p>
<p>Flour Industry The flour industry is also one of China's important industries. Currently, there are 83 flour factories in the country, excluding the Northeast. There are 38 in Jiangsu, 6 in Shandong, 9 each in Hebei and Hubei, 4 in Henan, 3 each in Anhui and Shanxi, and 1 in Hunan. Shanghai in the south, Tianjin in the north, and Wuhan in Hubei are the most prosperous. The annual national output reaches more than 82 million bags.</p>
<p>This industry was also on the verge of collapse in the first half of this year, like other industries, but it improved somewhat in the second half of the year. The reason for this is, as Mr. Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Banking Association, said: "This is because this year's floods and droughts in various places have been unusually severe,</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>and there has been a crop failure, with disaster victims all over the country. As the saying goes, things are valued when they are scarce. Therefore, the flour industry has seized the opportunity to rise. Now flour prices are rising, and sales are also quite strong, so this year, amid the economic downturn of all industries at the end of the year, only the flour industry can get through it safely." (See Shanghai Zhonghua Daily, December 9)</p>
<p>Match Industry Although the match industry is not as important as the cotton yarn, silk, and flour industries in Chinese industry, it is also a developing industry. However, in the past year, due to foreign goods stifling the industry, sluggish sales, stockpiles of inventory, and plummeting prices, many companies have declared bankruptcy. In addition to the eight factories in the four provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Hubei merging into the China National Match Co., Ltd. to control operations in an effort to save themselves, there has recently been a widespread restriction on production to weather the difficulties.</p>
<p>Rubber Industry According to the Shanghai Rubber Trade Association: "Recently, after overseas Chinese failed in operating rubber businesses, Shanghai rubber factories have also suffered due to the fall in overseas rubber prices, the dumping of Japanese goods, and the fierce competition among companies. Supply exceeds demand, causing prices to plummet, and manufacturers are losing money. Recently, among the 37 existing companies in Shanghai, 25 have closed down one after another, and although the remaining 12 are able to maintain operations with difficulty, they are also in dire straits during the closing account period." (See Shanghai Zhonghua Daily, December 3)</p>
<p>In addition, industries such as cement, enamel, thermos bottles, wool textiles, hat making, umbrellas, cosmetics, glass manufacturing, oil manufacturing, and electrical appliances have all shown decline due to the rural economic downturn, the dumping of foreign goods, and the drying up of finance.</p>
<p>In summary, generally speaking, China's industry in 1934 can be said to have reached the end of the road.</p>
<p>3.  Massive Outflow of Silver Leads to Financial Depletion in Urban and Rural Areas</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the decline of rural areas, political instability in the interior, funds from all over the country have concentrated in cities, with banks as their final destination. This has created the abnormal phenomenon of financial depletion in rural areas and financial expansion in cities. Although this is not a situation unique to this year, it is particularly serious this year. Taking Shanghai as an example, the reserves of Chinese and foreign banks increased from 547,447,000 yuan at the end of last year to 594,065,000 yuan at the end of May this year. Although it decreased gradually after that, as of December 6, it has sharply decreased to 334,104,000 yuan. However, this sharp decrease is definitely not flowing into the interior, but is the result of the U.S. President Roosevelt signing the Silver Purchase Act on June 21 and signing the Nationalization of Silver Order on August 9, which caused the price of silver abroad to skyrocket and led to a rapid outflow. This outflow did not stop even after the imposition of export taxes and balancing taxes on silver starting from September 15. According to reports, several batches of silver have recently been transported to the interior, such as Xiamen and Shantou in the south and Tianjin and Qinhuangdao in the north. However, not all of these inflows of silver into the interior are for the purpose of relieving the depleted rural finance and purchasing agricultural products. At least a large part of it is being smuggled out of the country after passing through the interior in order to avoid customs taxes. For example, the Hong Kong Industrial and Commercial Daily reported on November 12 that news had spread in the local banking community that more than 20 million yuan worth of silver had been smuggled into Hong Kong, which is one example. The massive outflow of silver has a significant impact on China's national economy, and its impact on the financial industry is first and foremost to create a crisis in the current Chinese financial system built on the basis of silver reserves. Because silver is flowing out and silver reserves are sharply reduced, the issuance of currency must be restricted. As a result, in the context of a shortage of hard currency, it is even more impossible to increase the amount of paper currency, leading to insufficient currency, credit contraction, tight money supply, and a lack of smooth flow of domestic capital. Although it has not yet reached such a serious point, the fact that Shanghai's interbank lending rate has risen from a normal, extremely loose 1-2% to a recent 2-3% tells us that if this continues, the crisis will eventually intensify. Secondly, after the massive outflow of silver, credit contracts, money becomes tight, and industry and commerce decline, making it difficult for banks and pawnshops to recover the extended term accounts, leading to turnover problems and even bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Over the past year, the monetary policies of imperialist powers, especially American imperialism, have not only caused silver prices to rise, leading to a massive outflow of Chinese silver reserves and inflicting a major blow on the Chinese financial industry, but also caused silver prices to fluctuate constantly, leading to unstable exchange rates and losses for many Chinese banks and pawnshops. According to statistics, in just two weeks from September 19 to October 2, more than a dozen companies in Shanghai, such as De Kang Gold Shop, and in Tianjin, such as Hongyuan Silver Shop, Yiju Silver Shop, Yisheng Silver Shop, Yuju Silver Shop, Enqingyong Silver Shop, Enqinghou Silver Shop, Chengming Silver Shop, and in Ningbo, such as Yukang Flower Shop, Chunyu Pawnshop, Hengxin Bamboo Shoot Factory, and Nianfeng Rice Factory, went bankrupt one after another. Although there is now an organization called the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee and the settlement of accounts is now done through customs gold units, with the government explicitly banning speculation, the successive bankruptcies of the aforementioned gold shops, silver shops, and pawnshops, and the hollowness of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee, prove how weak such relief and prevention efforts are. In short, China's financial industry over the past year can be said to have been completely defenseless, subjected to the oppressive economic policies of imperialist aggression, and experiencing days of turmoil and insecurity.</p>
<p>In addition, we can also observe China's financial industry over the past year from the perspective of issuance and business trends.</p>
<p>Regarding issuance, the following table shows the figures:</p>
<p>End of June This Year End of November This Year</p>
<p>Central Bank 70,844,000 yuan 79,493,379 yuan</p>
<p>Bank of China 112,419,000 yuan 136,298,035 yuan</p>
<p>Bank of Communications 41,023,000 yuan 56,382,431 yuan</p>
<p>Zhejiang Industrial Bank 8,883,000 yuan 8,610,000 yuan</p>
<p>China Industrial Bank 32,069,000 yuan 32,233,413 yuan</p>
<p>China &amp; South Sea Bank 35,848,000 yuan 30,859,173 yuan</p>
<p>Sze Ming Bank 17,084,000 yuan 16,504,000 yuan</p>
<p>China General Chamber of Commerce Bank 21,689,000 yuan 20,400,000 yuan</p>
<p>China Land Reclamation Bank 6,701,000 yuan 6,710,000 yuan</p>
<p>China Agricultural &amp; Industrial Bank 5,701,000 yuan 5,972,762 yuan</p>
<p>Total 352,370,000 yuan 393,359,203 yuan</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be seen that the total amount of currency issued by various banks in Shanghai in June this year was 352,370,000 yuan, an increase of more than 72.9 million yuan compared to 279,458,046 yuan in the same period last year. The total amount in November, 393,359,203 yuan, also increased by more than 49.495 million yuan compared to 343,863,311 yuan at the end of last year. As for business operations, in addition to expanding speculation, reducing loans to industry and commerce, and continuing other non-core businesses this year, there have been continued attempts to extend loans to rural areas, vigorous promotion of small loans, and competition for investment in railways and highways.</p>
<p>4.  Commercial Slump and Shrinking International Trade</p>
<p>China's commerce over the past year has continued its previous slump and has become even more萎縮 (atrophied/shrunken). For example, in Shanghai, known as China's largest commercial port, hundreds of stores have closed down in the prosperous areas such as Nanjing Road and Shilu due to poor turnover. The Special Zone and the South City Court are handling more than double the number of lawsuits of this kind than in previous years, and the court is executing the closure of several stores every day. Dozens of civilian financial institutions such as pawnshops such as Tongyuan and Yucheng have closed down because they only accept items and have no money to lend out. Hangzhou's commerce has not been slightly remedied by the completion of the Hangjiang Road and the highway network. In Jiujiang, in addition to munitions, general commodities are subject to the collection of production and sales taxes, and exports have decreased two to three times compared to previous years. In Hankou, the market is very quiet because the government controls the special goods trade. According to a report by the Hankou Commodity Inspection Bureau, compared with the same period last year, exports in July this year have decreased significantly in cotton, tea oil, cowhide, and egg products, except for a few items such as black tea, green tea, and tung oil. Imports from January to September were about 21 million yuan, a decrease of 6 million yuan compared to the same period last year. The desolation of the only major city in Central China is evident from this.</p>
<p>The situation in the Yangtze River Basin, the richest area in the country, is already like this, then it goes without saying that the situation in North China, which is under the iron hooves and tightened control of Japanese imperialism, is even worse. In Kaifeng, Henan, since the collapse of Xinchang Company this spring, the business of the entire city's financial sector has been unusually sluggish. Transportation, sundries, silk, raw oil, and other categories are all deserted, especially raw oil merchants, more than a dozen of whom have gone bankrupt. In Tianjin, the market is also extremely desolate due to the sharp decline in exports of agricultural products and fur from the interior. In Shanxi, various businesses have closed down due to social poverty and the collection of business tax and income tax. According to reports from 35 cities and counties including Taiyuan, Datong, Qi, Jie, Fenyang, etc., there were 6,757 old businesses in 42 industries such as silver and money. There were 153 new businesses this year, while 1,838 businesses closed down. Currently, there are about 4,000 businesses that have closed down in the 106 counties of the province. Except for Rehe, the main cities in Inner Mongolia are extremely depressed. Zhangjiakou's market is slightly more stable than it was during the chaotic times of war last year. No one cares about the transportation of grain into Baotou, and the entire city is extremely deserted. In the Northwest provinces, such as the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway, the number of cars has been reduced from 100 to half due to the small number of passengers and goods, and the revenue is not enough to cover the cost of fuel, which shows the decline of the market. In Pingliang, Gansu, eight stores closed down within a month.</p>
<p>Commerce in South China is affected by the decrease in remittances from overseas Chinese, in addition to the generally unfavorable conditions. Various industries in Guangzhou are competing to sell to survive. According to the Hong Kong Industrial and Commercial Daily: "The sluggishness of Guangzhou's business this year is unprecedented, and the entire line is in danger of collapsing." Shantou, a major trading town in eastern Guangdong, has been in extreme financial turmoil. Since the discovery of a large number of commercial warehouse receipts in September of this year, almost all trade in the market has been suspended. In addition, provinces such as Fujian and Guangxi are even more depressed than Guangdong.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, although imperialists are making every effort to dump goods, imports this year have still decreased sharply. According to customs reports, the cumulative number of imports from January to October was 874,114,029 yuan, a decrease of 283,809,861 yuan compared to 1,157,923,890 yuan in the same period last year. Exports also decreased from 506,954,698 yuan from January to October last year to 441,865,850 yuan from January to October this year, a decrease of 65,088,839 yuan. As a result, the trade deficit also decreased from 650,969,201 yuan from January to October last year to 432,248,179 yuan from January to October this year, a decrease of 218,621,022 yuan.</p>
<p>In short, China's economy in 1934 can be said to have further declined under the multiple oppressions of imperialism, natural disasters, and man-made disasters.</p>
<h3>Semi-Monthly News</h3>
<p>— Staff Contributor</p>
<p>Guangdong-Guangxi International Telegrams to be Charged in National Currency</p>
<p>Telegrams sent abroad from Guangdong and Guangxi provinces have previously been charged according to Hong Kong dollar rates. The Ministry of Communications, in order to unify the charging methods of telegraph bureaus nationwide, has ordered the telegraph bureaus and stations in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces to change to charging according to national currency rates starting from December. As for the practice in various parts of Guangdong Province of using silver dollars with "hao" markings, it is specifically stipulated that the exchange rate will be in accordance with the post office's conversion rate, with one national currency dollar equivalent to one dollar and three dimes in silver dollars with "hao" markings. If Hong Kong dollars are used for payment, they will be accepted at 93% of the national currency rate, meaning 93 Hong Kong cents equals one national currency dollar. This exchange rate will be determined based on market fluctuations, and any changes will be announced by the telegraph bureaus.</p>
<p>Supplementary Measures for Calculating Charges for Chinese Telegrams</p>
<p>Chinese telegrams are primarily sent by our Chinese citizens, so the Ministry of Communications is providing as much convenience as possible regarding charging restrictions. The latest supplementary points are noted below:</p>
<p>(1) House numbers composed of Roman letters and Arabic numerals, such as A7, J45, etc., are allowed to be calculated as one word.</p>
<p>(2) Telegrams containing only Arabic numerals and unit words, without context, such as (734) number, (687) yuan, etc., are allowed to be sent.</p>
<p>(3) If the name and address of the recipient include words such as "residence," "mansion," "villa," "at home," "official residence," etc., such as "Shen Guohua residence," "Shen mansion," "Jingan villa," "Yang Fu at home," "Datong official residence," etc., because their nature is similar to the names of organizations, businesses, hotels, etc., they are all allowed to be included in the address calculation.</p>
<p>(4) If the recipient's name includes titles, such as Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, President Dai Jitao, Principal Wang Yiming, Lawyer Jiang, Accountant Pan, etc., the names of these titles will be included in the recipient's name and address calculation. Also, if "Mrs. Zhang," "Miss Li," etc., are used without adding the given name, the words "Mrs." and "Miss" are also allowed to be included in the name and address, and will not be calculated as text. However, honorifics such as "Mr." and "Sir" must be included in the telegram's word count.</p>

<h3>The Trend of World Economy in 1935</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>In the past year, the world economy has been subjected to much tribulation. What of the coming year? Based on the current situation, it is not difficult to gain a relatively clear understanding by extrapolating into the future. We Chinese people are also caught up in the world's turbulence, and are severely affected by international events. If we can discern the international trends, it will be of considerable help in understanding the movements of our own national economic situation.</p>
<p>Currently, there are three relatively major economic problems in the world.</p>
<p>(1) What is the future of inflation policies?</p>
<p>(2) Will the European gold standard be shaken?</p>
<p>(3) How will future markets be developed?</p>
<p>In the development of our Chinese national economy, inflation policies have only been discussed in theory. We have no actual, overall experience. In the past, things like the "military currency" of the early Republic, the banknotes of Wuhan, the Jin banknotes of Shanxi, and the provincial banknotes of Guangdong cannot be considered inflation policies. The so-called inflation policy today must at least have the following two economic effects:</p>
<p>First, it must raise prices. Since the world panic of 1929, major countries have all experienced falling prices due to overproduction and reduced consumption power. Therefore, they have had to find ways to raise prices so that existing industries do not stagnate. If the value of money is reduced, prices will naturally rise relatively. At the same time, there is another effect: stimulating emerging industries.</p>
<p>Second, it must open up new markets. Before the American stock market crash in the autumn of 1929, countries had all restored the gold standard, stabilizing the value of currency. As a result, wage and salary income was invisibly reduced. Government budgets also shrank. Therefore, the consumption power of general society was reduced along with it. As a result, the digestive capacity of domestic markets was small. In overseas markets, major countries all had some degree of protectionist trade measures. Conversely, countries using silver benefited from being on the upper hand in exports. Importing from them was restricted by high prices. Once an inflation policy is implemented, it can not only increase exports to silver-using countries, but also break through tariff barriers and compete for overseas markets. Domestic markets can also be slightly expanded due to the general increase in wages.</p>
<p>However, in reality, only Britain and Japan have benefited from inflation. One reason is that they abandoned the gold standard relatively early, and the other is that they are both engaged in special markets, such as the development of colonies, which is more convenient than for other countries. The United States only abandoned the gold standard in April 1933 and implemented a reduction in the value of currency in January 1934. Unfortunately, it was too late, so it did not receive any practical benefits. Now there is a new policy following the National Industrial Recovery Act, and for the fiscal year ending in June 1934, the financial deficit was US$3,626 million. Public debt increased by US$4,514 million. It seems that it will be impossible not to continue to implement inflation. Moreover, the implementation of the new policy still requires new expenditures of US$5 billion to US$20 billion.</p>
<p>Currently, all major countries except France and Germany are implementing inflation policies. On the one hand, they are striving to seize overseas markets. On the other hand, they are expanding the power of the national economy as much as possible within the country, wanting their own country to monopolize the domestic market. Unless absolutely necessary, they will never allow foreign goods to be imported. For example, the United States imports raw silk and ore, and Japan imports cotton and iron ore and pig iron. In this way, they can only develop towards countries with relatively backward industries or colonial markets. However, the economies of these markets themselves are also declining. In essence, purchasing power is abnormally reduced. Trying to expand even more than now will almost be impossible, and may even shrink further. The countries of South America have small populations, and there is no outlet for their agricultural products. Expanding this market again is probably impossible. China has a large population and vast land, but in recent years, its people have become poor and its finances exhausted. It is also difficult to increase unilateral imports.</p>
<p>As for their domestic markets, a large country like the United States has as many as 11 million unemployed people. These people have no work, so where will they find the surplus power to consume? Britain is similar to this. Unemployment is usually over 2 million. The economic alliance within the British Empire is only a temporary remedy. Japan has had the best economic situation among capitalist countries in recent years. However, in the autumn of 1934, various industrial sectors showed a downward trend. The reason is a reduction in foreign exports. Future hopes are very slim. Therefore, the future of inflation policies is not optimistic. Moreover, there is still much pessimistic material.</p>
<p>The countries that still maintain the gold standard, such as France, Belgium, Switzerland, and the Netherlands, truly hold the reins of the financial world in Europe. They have also declared that they will not abandon the gold standard. The reason is that they suffered greatly from excessive inflation during the First World War. In particular, Germany still retains the negative effects of that time. However, they have recently been greatly shaken by the devaluation of currency by Britain and the United States. In particular, prices in France are falling more and more, and there is also a tendency for gold reserves to decrease. Income and expenditure other than trade is also decreasing. Overseas trade seems to be falling behind Britain, the United States, and Japan. Recently, the calls for reducing currency value have gradually increased in the industrial sector. It is feared that she will not be able to maintain the gold standard for long. Otherwise, this group of gold standard countries will not be able to compete economically with non-gold standard countries. However, abandoning the gold standard and implementing inflation policies may not have any special benefits.</p>

<h3>Japan's Declaration of Treaty Abolition and the Future of East Asian Issues</h3>
<p>— Wang Jiyuan</p>
<p>Since the Second Preparatory Conference for the London Naval Treaty began on October 23, it has presented a bleak and gloomy picture. Although triangular negotiations between the United States and Japan, Britain and the United States, and Britain and Japan have continued, the positions of the three countries and the points of contention at the conference have not changed in the slightest. Japan, with its offensive strategy, has loudly proclaimed the abolition of the principle of ratios and its replacement with the right to equal national defense. The United States, citing the length of its coastline and the need to maintain the Open Door Policy in East Asia, has firmly opposed changing the existing ratios. Britain, with its sophisticated tactics, has taken a mediatory position, engaging in shuttle diplomacy between the two sides. The conference has progressed from technical disputes to probes into the three parties' political opinions, and from the confrontation of political views back to the sticking points of technical issues, circulating back and forth for nearly two months. It was not until the news of the Japanese Privy Council's passage of the treaty abolition reached them that the negotiations were adjourned indefinitely on December 19.</p>
<p>Like a thunderbolt, Japan's formal notification of the abolition of the naval treaty was issued on December 29. The remnants of the Washington Naval Treaty have now been torn to shreds by Japan!</p>
<p>Japan's preparations for treaty abolition have been underway for some time. The reason for the delay in publishing it was, on the one hand, to use this as a surprise move, to make the British and American countries automatically concede on interests in the Far East, and automatically declare the modification of the Washington Naval Treaty; on the other hand, to unite with France and Italy to take a unified action of declaring abandonment, in order to strengthen momentum. Later, as a result of talks between Foreign Minister Hirota and the French and Italian ambassadors to Japan, both governments were unwilling to make such a statement. Japan was left with no choice but to make a unilateral declaration of abandoning the treaty at the end of last year, and revealed that it held two reasons: (1) It believed that when the Washington Treaty was signed, it was still impossible for the enemy's fleet to attack Japan by passing through the Pacific Ocean. Now, however, it is not the case. In recent years, the naval community has conducted repeated research and naval exercises, proving that the Pacific Ocean can not only be crossed, but also that in a Pacific naval battle, the fleet with a numerical advantage will certainly win; (2) It believed that since the establishment of "Manchukuo," the situation in East Asia has undergone a change, and the current world political situation is also very tense, which is enough to threaten Japan's position in East Asia. Therefore, the treaty is no longer in line with the needs of the times and will in the future cause defects in Japan's national defense. Therefore, it decided to abandon the treaty at the opportunity of its expiration in 1936. In fact, this kind of argument is enough to show its aggressive ambitions. Japan is really responsible for the tension in East Asian politics. This is self-evident without debate. Judging from the current Japanese naval power and the situation in various countries, it is even more evident that Britain and the United States have no possibility or need to attack Japan: In our opinion, although Japan is exercising its right to declare abandonment based on the treaty, its effect is nothing more than two points:</p>
<p>First, since the September 18th Incident, Japan has occupied our four northeastern provinces by force, established a puppet state, and at the same time, declared its withdrawal from the League of Nations, and further made a statement of monopolizing East Asia. The attitudes of various countries vary, and none dare to touch its reversed scales. Japan also knows that the whole world is swept into the tide of recession, and various countries must be unwilling to argue with it for too long at this time. Therefore, it is the time to declare the abolition of the treaty. After the Washington Naval Treaty is abandoned, Japan can not only freely manufacture warships according to its objective environmental needs, but also use its powerful naval power to expand its external aggression and blockade the Western Pacific, so that once a war breaks out, the warships of various countries, if they do not take risks, cannot cross the Lei Chi step.</p>
<p>Second, since the Washington Naval Treaty has been abandoned, the Four-Power Treaty, which was signed at the same time as the Washington Treaty, and the Four-Power Agreement, has in fact lost its effectiveness. The Open Door Policy must be re-examined, and new treaties must be redrafted to limit naval forces in the Pacific. Not only has the Washington Treaty system collapsed, but the League of Nations' control over the Pacific has also been destroyed in one fell swoop. The issue of Japan's return of the Pacific mandated territory in February and March of this year need not be discussed.</p>
<p>Therefore, although Japan's declaration of treaty abolition is only a legal action based on the treaty, its significance is extremely important. It cannot be discussed separately from the naval contraction negotiations, nor can it be separated from any issue in the Pacific. Its impact on the future of East Asian political issues is even greater. The center of the naval contraction issue from now on has progressed to how to clean up this fragmented situation and establish a flexible compromise in order to maintain temporary tranquility in the Pacific. As for the China issue, British Foreign Secretary Simon once said in his speech: "The British government believes that what is most important to world peace is that the naval powers with special interests and special responsibilities in the Far East continue to coordinate the limitation of naval forces and engage in cooperation with a collection system aimed at maintaining friendly relations between countries within the Far East." Simon's words have exposed the key issues in the naval conference. Since Japan has proudly declared the abolition of the treaty, the issue from now on is nothing more than how to carry out the method of jointly handling China.</p>
<p>Regarding the solution to East Asian issues, there have been two ambiguous trends in the preparatory meeting for the naval contraction. On the one hand, Japan has been trying its best to collude with Britain, using investment in Manchuria and guaranteeing interests in East Asia as bait, attempting to revive the dead ashes of the Anglo-Japanese alliance, in order to exclude the influence of third countries in China. The British Conservative Party, which is firmly embracing overseas market expansionism, is also happy to cooperate with it. On the other hand, the United States is calling for close cooperation between Britain and the United States by maintaining the Open Door Policy in the Far East, and advocating the expansion of the Pacific Three-Power Conference to establish a Pan-Pacific Coordination of Britain, the United States, Japan, France, Italy, and Russia, to incorporate the naval technical issues into the conditions for solving political issues. The Japanese mocked this attempt by the United States as "wishful thinking." In fact, the time when the objective conditions for Anglo-American cooperation are ripe is still far away. Moreover, in terms of the relationship between Britain and the United States, the Far East issue must not be compared with the "ship type" and "total tonnage" issues. In terms of the relationship between Britain and Japan, the Far East political issue and the technical issue must be integrated into one. In addition, the activities of France, Italy, Germany, and Russia in the Far East are also facts that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Therefore, the focus of the East Asian issue at present is: (1) Anglo-American cooperation? (2) Anglo-Japanese combination? (3) Or the universal coordination of countries with special interests and special responsibilities in the Far East? The collection system pointed out by Foreign Minister Simon clearly refers to the solution of the Far East issue must take the third path, at least the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan must establish a triangular relationship in a friendly manner. Only in this way can the stalemate of the naval contraction conference be broken, and the debate on military equality and the ratio principle, battleships and auxiliary ships, can establish a new agreement.</p>
<p>Now Japan has formally notified the abolition of the treaty! The representatives of the London Naval Contraction Preparatory Meeting will also quietly return to their home countries. The tragic first act of the naval contraction has been declared over. The issue from now on has shifted to the compromise of opinions on the East Asian issue. Our country, with no strong navy, has become the meat on the chopping board for the great powers to covet. Will our countrymen silently endure the slaughter of the great powers, or will they think about working hard, identify their goals, and prepare to resist foreign aggression! On the occasion of the New Year's renewal and the arrival of the 24th year of the Republic of China, I dare to ask this question to the people of the country.</p>
<h3>A Review of World Politics in 1934</h3>
<p>— Ren Xiang</p>
<p>It has been six years since the postwar world fell into the abyss of total panic. In this year of 1935, we look back at the world politics of the past year. Compared with the beginning of the panic, what kind of changes have taken place in its content? Generally speaking, world politics is moving towards an increasingly acute stage year by year. That trend is very clear. Let's not talk about the years before 1930. Starting from 1931, the main political struggles in Europe were hidden behind the financial turmoil, drawing Vienna, Berlin, and London into the center of the vortex. In 1932, the German Nazi Party movement gradually rose, and the call for military equality was also put forward at that time. This of course reflected that the competition for hegemony in Central Europe had entered a new stage. At the beginning of 1933, the first thing that happened was that Hitler seized power in Germany. As a result, European politics changed direction. Later, the attempt by the great powers to compromise proved to be a complete failure at the London Economic Conference in July. And the outcome of Britain's mediation of German and French armaments only resulted in France's rapprochement with the Soviet Union. Germany's withdrawal from disarmament and the League of Nations were all inevitable. At this time, Austria and Italy joined together, which proved that new storms were brewing in Central Europe and Southeastern Europe. Now we look back at the European political situation in 1934. The content of its disputes has of course been further advanced. Secondly, in the Pacific, we can see the same overall situation. After the September 18th Incident (1931), followed by the outbreak of the January 28th Sino-Japanese War in Shanghai, the contradictory relations between the great powers in the Pacific became tense step by step. By February 1933, Japan had advanced into Jehol, and the Tanggu Truce was concluded. On the one hand, Japan had announced its withdrawal from the League of Nations. On the other hand, the League of Nations' technical cooperation plan in China was being launched. In the same year, several things happened that were related to the overall situation in the Pacific. The first was the establishment of the London Silver Agreement in July. The second was the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia in November. We compare these experiences with the Far Eastern politics of 1934. Of course, we can see that the contradictory relations between the great powers in the Pacific are still developing.</p>
<p>What are the fundamental reasons for the tension between the great powers today? Generally speaking, there are about two points. First, the great powers have strengthened their seizure of colonial interests. Because the main goal of world politics under the control of the great powers today is the control of capital and commodity markets. Therefore, conflicts caused by the seizure of colonies are inevitable. Second, the domestic economies of the great powers are unstable. At present, major countries such as Britain, the United States, Germany, France, Japan, and Italy have all suffered heavy blows in terms of production. Therefore, a large number of unemployed people have emerged. Domestic economic instability is a major cause of the antagonistic state of international relations. These are the two essential perspectives we use to explain world politics in 1934.</p>
<p>Now we have to give a rough outline of the important contents of the world political situation in 1934.</p>
<p>In the Pacific, the first thing that deserves our attention is the naval conference of the British Empire in Singapore (January 26). The convening of this conference pointed out that Britain and Japan are competing in the Indian Ocean and Pacific markets. The construction of Britain's eastern Gibraltar and Japan's military deployments are reflecting each other in succession. Japan's attempt to dig through the Kra Isthmus in Siam not only caused panic in Singapore, but also caused anxiety in Siam. Secondly, since 1933, the great powers have been reluctant to give up their influence because they are afraid of the expansion of Japanese power. Therefore, Japan issued the Amau Doctrine on April 17, 1934. On the one hand, this has had some impact on the League of Nations' technical cooperation plan. On the other hand, it is forcing China to yield. Under this situation, Japan's military equipment is becoming more and more obvious not only in Northeast China and Inner Mongolia, but also in other places. Again, how Japan's leading power in East Asia is naturally closely related to her naval military equipment. Therefore, the naval contraction preparatory conference convened in London in October 1934 had to make the confrontation between Japan and the United States an undeniable fact due to Japan's strong demands. The Washington Treaty was therefore abolished. This is tantamount to saying publicly that the foundation of peace in the Pacific has been completely sacrificed under the power of military competition.</p>
<p>In 1934, the state of entanglement in European politics seemed to be even more tense than in the Pacific. The first shocking thing in this year was the suppression of the Austrian Nazi Party by Dollfuss in January. The reason why Austria did this was of course due to "having nothing to fear" internationally. However, Germany could not be reconciled to this. Therefore, in the coup on July 25, Dollfuss was sacrificed in this dispute. Fortunately, the Nazi Party was quick-witted and changed course, and the evil storm in Vienna dissipated immediately. However, there is still one point worth noting. That is, the joint action against Austria that Britain, France, and Italy have been advocating for years has obviously reduced its color compared to before 1934. This mainly illustrates the expansion of the rivalry between France and Italy in Central and Southeastern Europe.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that French Foreign Minister Barthou's policy was to consolidate the Versailles system. Therefore, on the one hand, he made friends with the Soviet Union and advocated the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact. On the other hand, he united the Balkan and Central European Little Entente countries to achieve the effect of 指臂. However, Poland therefore approached Germany, and the situation in Southeastern Europe became even more tense. In October, King Alexander of Yugoslavia and French Foreign Minister Barthou had to be sacrificed by their enemies in Marseille. This was another tragic scene.</p>
<p>Amidst such turmoil in Europe, the relationship between France and the Soviet Union has developed further. This is the event of the Soviet Union joining the League of Nations on September 18, 1934. The Soviet Union's joining the League of Nations was brewing at a time when Britain was mediating between German and French armaments in order to suppress Germany. That is a fact that everyone knows. The realization of this event clearly indicates whether the breakdown of European peace is imminent. However, in this situation, Germany has even more difficulties in maintaining peace. If her domestic political disputes are not as moderate as they are now, I am afraid that the peace of the overall European situation will not be maintained to this day.</p>
<p>From the Pacific to Europe, we have given a rough outline of world politics in 1934 in the above. Looking forward to the world politics of the coming year, what will be the overall situation? Judging from the development of history, the current world has obviously entered a period of brewing that is epoch-making. The arms race in the Pacific is a very important feature of 1935. Secondly, the internal political changes and diplomatic tensions in European countries will probably advance simultaneously with 1935. If we combine these two aspects, it cannot be regarded as a general threat to world peace for mankind. As for how to realize the plan for maintaining world peace, I think it is always a common responsibility for the people of the world in 1935.</p>
<h3>Implementation Plan for National Products Education</h3>
<p>— Pan Wenan</p>
<p>In recent years, China has suffered deeply from the economic aggression of various countries, leading the national economy into a desperate situation. To seek fundamental relief, the people of the country have called for resisting foreign goods and promoting domestic products. However, resisting foreign goods is a passive preventive method, while promoting domestic products is the ultimate active remedy. Simply advocating resistance without real strength is futile; active promotion embodies the profound intention of revitalizing industry and resisting foreign goods.</p>
<p>This year, enthusiastic individuals in Shanghai, in conjunction with the national products and education sectors, have further designated this year as "Student National Products Year" to increase the effectiveness of promoting domestic products. This intention is excellent. Therefore, a "National Products Education Implementation Plan" is proposed as a reference for schools in various regions, outlined as follows:</p>
<p>A. Administrative Aspects:</p>
<p>1. Regarding Schools:</p>
<p>(1) Schools should, as a primary principle, adopt domestic products for educational stationery, student uniforms, and all other necessary supplies.</p>
<p>(2) Promulgate measures to reward students for purchasing domestic goods and prohibit students from purchasing foreign goods. (Each school can freely determine these.)</p>
<p>(3) Establish a National Products Salvation Administrative Committee: such as National Products Consumption Week, National Products Exhibition Week, National Products Investigation Week, National Products Factory Visit Week, National Products Lecture Week, etc., so that the entire school has a central task of promoting domestic products and saving the country every week or month.</p>
<p>(4) Arrange a school environment that promotes domestic products and saves the country: various surveys and statistics on domestic product industries, statistics on the economic losses suffered by China from various countries, and other charts, murals, photographs, slogans, etc., related to the promotion of domestic products and saving the country; to startle young people and inspire them to strive.</p>
<p>(5) Stipulate research work and equipment, such as research on the development of Chinese national product industries, the relationship between promoting national products and the national economy, an overview of foreign goods sales in China and the losses suffered by China, the situation of foreign goods imports and domestic goods exports, the methods and steps for promoting domestic products, research on various domestic product raw materials; and the equipment of national product exhibition rooms and factories, etc.</p>
<p>(6) Use memorial weeks and commemorative days to read vows of love for domestic products, hold national product lectures, sing songs promoting domestic products, shout slogans promoting domestic products, etc., to stimulate students' determination to promote domestic products and save the country.</p>
<p>(7) Use memorial holidays to reward students and send them to various places to publicize, thereby awakening public understanding and attention.</p>
<p>(8) Establish a special National Products Salvation Lecture Series, inviting famous people to talk about the development of various Chinese national product industries and the paths for the development of various Chinese national product industries, etc., to awaken students' recognition and attention.</p>
<p>(9) Schools should earnestly contact domestic product manufacturers, such as national product introductions, sample displays, factory visits, etc., to increase the effectiveness of promoting national products and saving the country.</p>
<p>(10) Publish various publications related to national products and saving the country; such as a list of national product manufacturers, a list of domestic products,</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>periodicals introducing national products, etc., to instill in students all kinds of knowledge about national products.</p>
<p>2. Regarding Faculty and Staff:</p>
<p>(1) All faculty and staff should uniformly strive to carry out the school's established policies and enthusiastically participate in all school national product activities.</p>

<p>(3) Should live with the students, regardless of diet and daily life, to facilitate the effectiveness of national product guidance.</p>
<p>(4) Guide students in all activities promoting national products.</p>
<p>(5) Should use holidays to visit and investigate domestic product factories and businesses to increase service effectiveness.</p>
<p>(6) Should seek earnest contact with domestic product manufacturers.</p>
<p>B. Teaching Aspects:</p>
<p>1. Regarding Teaching Materials:</p>
<p>(1) Select and read the words, deeds, biographies, and success stories of pioneers in the national products sector and inventors of new industrial products.</p>
<p>(2) Select and read articles and poems promoting domestic products.</p>
<p>(3) Create more articles on national products salvation.</p>

<p>(2) Organize domestic product consumption associations, national product improvement associations, national product raw material research associations, etc., to enhance students' understanding and efforts towards national products.</p>
<p>(3) Hold thematic research: such as how to develop national product industries, how to promote national products, the relationship between promoting national products and transportation, etc., to develop students' creative abilities.</p>
<p>(4) Hold national product investigations: what kinds of goods are national products, what kinds of goods are foreign goods, and further research industries that substitute for foreign goods.</p>
<p>(5) Use holidays to go to various places to give speeches on the importance of national product salvation and promotional activities such as masquerade performances. To awaken the public's awareness.</p>
<p>(6) Practice the manufacturing methods of everyday national product goods, etc.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of Jiangsu Finance</h3>
<p>— Zhao Dihua</p>
<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>Jiangsu has long been known as a region of wealth, with abundant products and developed commerce. However, in recent years, the situation has changed. Not only is the private economy in a state of distress, but the public finances are also like a family in decline. Although the facade remains, the actual strength is exhausted, stretched to the limit, and resources are depleted. As for the development of enterprises, it is even more out of the question. The author, a native of Jiangsu, deeply doubts why the financial strength of Jiangsu Province has declined to this extent, and has tried to investigate the reasons without success. Last winter, I was ordered to manage the finances of Jiangsu Province, and I am not without trepidation in shouldering this important task. However, the doubts of the past can be verified with actual practice, and a reorganization plan can be established based on this, proceeding step by step. The extent to which it can accomplish its tasks is unpredictable, but day by day, month by month, it will naturally be able to promote benefits to the fullest. This is discussed in four sections, so that a glimpse of the reorganization of Jiangsu Province's finances over the past year can be seen.</p>
<p>II. Principles for Reorganizing Finances</p>
<p>Reorganizing finances cannot be achieved overnight. Proceeding step by step, its effects will be seen naturally. The principles of reorganization are divided into provincial and county levels:</p>
<p>1. Provincial Finance</p>
<p>A. Unified Revenue and Expenditure: In the past, the actual situation of provincial finance was that in terms of revenue and expenditure management, each agency handled its own affairs in the name of special funds, each using its source of income to allocate its use. Those with more income would expand their expenditure as much as possible, and the waste of public funds was considerable. Those with less income were deeply afraid of insufficient revenue and strived to open up sources of income, thereby increasing the burden on the people. Both have their drawbacks. If revenue and expenditure can be unified, the province's finances will have a complete system, adjusting surpluses and deficits, planning comprehensively, impartially, and allowing various enterprises to develop evenly and progress step by step. In order to implement unified revenue and expenditure, the "Measures for the Custody and Disbursement of Special Provincial Funds" were formulated to achieve unification.</p>
<p>B. Establish a Budget: The budget is the compass of financial administration. In terms of general effectiveness, (1) it can determine the standard for the government's future operations, (2) it is a tool for rectifying income and restricting excessive expenditure, (3) it is evidence of credibility with the people, and (4) it expresses the government's administrative plan, making various enterprises easier to manage. Since the effectiveness of the budget is as described above, it should be based on facts when preparing it. If it involves any superficiality, it will become a tool for deceiving the world. Jiangsu Province's provincial budget includes all revenue and expenditure. The income side can be divided into three major categories:</p>
<p>(1) Ordinary Provincial Taxes: These are the land tax, business tax, and deed tax, now plus the tobacco and alcohol license tax.</p>
<p>(2) Various Special Funds: There are two types: education and construction. Education is funded by the land tax, slaughter tax, and brokerage tax. Construction is funded by the land tax and business income, etc.</p>
<p>(3) Other Income: This includes central government subsidies, income from Sha Tian official property, and judicial or miscellaneous income.</p>
<p>Expenditure includes: Party affairs, administration, judiciary, public security, finance, education, industry, construction, health assistance fees, etc. In the past, the provincial budget failed to include all revenue and expenditure, so the entire situation could not be expressed. Starting from the 22nd year, all revenue and expenditure will be compiled to achieve unification.</p>
<p>C. Strictly Implement the Treasury System: In the past, Jiangsu Province's treasury was represented by four banks: Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Jiangsu Bank, and Farmers Bank. According to regulations, all provincial funds received should be deposited into the treasury immediately, but this could not be done in practice. Sometimes it was delayed for several months before being deposited after repeated reminders. During the delay, the county magistrate could deposit it into a private account to generate interest, so the establishment of the treasury failed to achieve its effect. Since the establishment of county accounting directors in the 22nd year, they have been responsible for supervising the deposit of funds into the treasury, and measures for the deposit of funds have been established with strict supervision. After several months of implementation, its effectiveness has become apparent.</p>
<p>D. Implement an Audit System: Pre-audit and post-audit are both important aspects of supervising finance. Jiangsu Province once established an audit committee, but it was soon abolished, resulting in unlimited expenditure by various agencies, which is not a prudent way to manage finances. Therefore, in March of the 22nd year, the "Organizational Regulations of the Audit Committee of the Jiangsu Provincial Government" and "Audit Rules" were formulated. It is stipulated that: 1. The payment orders for the use of provincial and local funds should be signed by the committee. 2. The revenue and expenditure calculations of the provincial government and its directly affiliated agencies shall be audited by the committee. Although it has only been implemented for a short time in the 23rd year, it has indeed achieved the practical effect of supervising finance.</p>
<p>E. Reform the Land Tax System: The land tax system in Jiangsu Province has been deeply ingrained for a long time. It relies solely on clerks who secretly hold their private registers as a secret. The addresses of false households are unknown, and the mu (unit of area) are not accurate, allowing the clerks to arbitrarily add or hide land, resulting in land without tax, tax without land, or more land with less tax, and less land with more tax. All kinds of irregularities arise from this. Since last winter, preparations for reform have been underway. The following aspects are being carried out this year:</p>
<p>(1) Conduct Land Declaration: In November of last year, the department sent personnel to various counties to investigate and conduct on-site inspections, and it was decided to start with Zhenjiang, Yixing, Liyang, and Jiangyin counties first. After sufficient preparation and widespread publicity, it was started this spring, and the results are satisfactory. All household registers and plot registers have been compiled. In the 23rd year, they will be used as the basis for creating strings of tax tickets. Counties that continue to conduct land declarations include: Jurong, Taicang, Wujiang, Jintan, Jiangdu, Yancheng, Tongshan, Suining, Muyang, Pei County, Yangzhou Chongming, Xinghua, and Xiao County, are currently underway.</p>
<p>(2) Reorganize Land Tax Surcharges: Land tax surcharges in Jiangsu Province are extremely complex, as everyone knows. Statistics show that there are as many as 105 different types of surcharges in the province, and the surcharges exceed the regular tax by several times to ten times or more. Although some of this is due to the regular tax being too low, resulting in the surcharges being particularly heavy, its complexity and disorder are undeniable. It has been strictly reorganized in accordance with central government laws and regulations. In counties where land declarations are being conducted, the newly added land and its newly added surcharges are entirely used to offset the reduction of surcharges, as exemplified by Yixing, as shown in the table below.</p>
<p>(3) Change Collection Methods: The following points concern changes in the procedures for collecting land tax:</p>
<p>(1) Banks Collect Taxes on Behalf of the Government: The land tax in Jiangsu Province has been deeply mired in malpractices. Unscrupulous clerks take advantage of this to collect excessive taxes and embezzle the difference, which has become an open secret. Therefore, in the 23rd year, measures were established for banks to collect taxes on behalf of the government, so that taxes are directly paid by taxpayers to the bank without going through the hands of clerks, thereby eliminating the malpractice of collecting excessive taxes and embezzlement. However, this measure is a newly established system, and for the sake of prudence, Zhenjiang, Wuxian, Yixing, Wujiang, Kunshan, Jiangyin, Shishan, and Jiading counties were designated to pilot the system first. In the months since then, the implementation has been relatively smooth.</p>
<p>(2) Change Tax Tickets from Silver to Yuan: In the past, the land tax in Jiangsu Province was calculated in silver, and the people paid their taxes in silver yuan. Taxpayers were unaware of how to calculate the exchange between silver and silver yuan, and clerks took advantage of this to collect excessive taxes. In order to eliminate this long-standing malpractice, strict orders have been issued to all counties to clearly state the mu (unit of area), tax rate, and amount of silver yuan payable on the tax tickets. People pay taxes according to the tax tickets, thereby reducing the malpractice of collecting excessive taxes.</p>
<p>(3) Pay Taxes at Counters: In order to facilitate tax payment for the people, branch counters have been established in the four rural areas in addition to the county's main counter. This allows taxpayers to pay their taxes at the counter nearby without having to go through clerks, which is a way to eliminate collecting excessive taxes and embezzlement.</p>
<p>2. County Finance</p>
<p>A. Reorganize the Budget: In the past, the budgets of various counties in Jiangsu Province were sent to the Department of Finance for review, but in reality, they were not reviewed, so the result was either fictitious revenue and actual expenditure, or falsely listed revenue and expenditure, which could not restrict calculations. The local agencies of various counties spent extravagantly, which was endless. In order to reorganize finances, the reorganization of the budget was first established as a principle.</p>
<p>B. Establish a Treasury: In the past, the cash revenue and expenditure procedures were extremely chaotic. The powers of tax collection agencies, management agencies, and expenditure agencies were not clearly defined. Since July of this year, county treasuries have been established. All revenue and expenditure of county local funds are managed by the treasury. Measures for the revenue, expenditure, and storage of county funds and the "Provisional Regulations for County Treasuries in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province" have been established to delineate them. In this way, the malpractice of mutual transfer of provincial and county funds in the past is completely eliminated.</p>
<p>C. Revise the Accounting System: Each county establishes an accounting director to manage accounting. All county government expenditures, fund reports, fund offsets, and loans, receipts, and contracts must be signed, countersigned, and stamped, and the county magistrate is jointly responsible. The accounting he handles is divided into two parts: provincial funds and county funds.</p>
<p>D. Implement an Audit System: Detailed regulations have been formulated regarding budget execution and cash procedures. The audit agency may refuse to sign for payments exceeding the budget. Pre-audit is already thorough. Regulations have also been formulated for the preparation of revenue and expenditure calculation documents. Extravagant and illegal expenditures are eliminated, so that post-audit can also be executed based on them.</p>
<p>Based on the above principles, laws and regulations have been formulated, talents have been selected, and efforts have been made to implement them in the shortest possible time. The progress of the implementation is described in the next section. III. Progress of the Reorganization Work</p>
<p>The malpractices of Jiangsu Province's finances have been long-standing, so although the principles of improvement have been established, there are still many obstacles during the implementation. There are those who harbor doubts and those who obstruct. The province earnestly persuades and informs the general public to understand the meaning and benefits of reform. The major aspects of the reorganization work are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Reform of the Budget: The reform of the provincial budget can be divided into the following four points:</p>
<p>A. Preparation Time: In the past, the provincial budget took a long time due to consultations between various responsible agencies, and by the time it was finally completed, the year was about to end, often losing its effectiveness. This time, the provincial budget was prepared to avoid this drawback.</p>
<p>B. Revenue Section: The 22nd year budget does not engage in fictitious assumptions, but relies entirely on reality. Therefore, the estimated revenue and the results are not too far apart.</p>
<p>C. Expenditure Section: Fixed items, such as the operating expenses of various agencies. Unfixed items, such as business expenses and temporary expenses. Before the general budget is established, each agency prepares a separate budget. After the separate budgets are reviewed and confirmed, the provincial budget is then compiled. This ensures that the foundation is correct and that there are no obstacles in executing the budget. This is also a reform of the budget preparation process.</p>
<p>The reform of the county budget can be divided into the following four points:</p>
<p>A. Review Procedures: Starting in November of the 22nd year, the Department of Finance organized county budget review committees to convene county magistrates from various counties to hold meetings for preliminary review, and the department also dispatched representatives to attend. After the preliminary review, each county immediately re-prepared a new budget based on the results of the review and submitted it to the provincial government meeting on schedule for final decision.</p>
<p>B. Estimate Revenue: Accurately calculate the land tax and other revenues to obtain a total revenue, and then calculate the total expenditure in order to form a balanced revenue and expenditure budget.</p>
<p>C. Reduce Expenditure: The general estimates listed by various counties all have extravagant and uneconomical expenditures, which have been greatly reduced. The principles for reduction are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Agencies that are not necessary should be eliminated to save overall expenses.</p>
<p>(2) Expenditures that are uneconomical or not urgently needed should be deleted.</p>
<p>(3) Temporary expenditures should not be included in recurring expenses.</p>
<p>D. Determine Subjects: The names of land tax surcharges in various counties are numerous and should be unified urgently. Therefore, the budget reform is to summarize them into land tax county tax, and the distribution is indicated separately by a percentage ratio.</p>
<p>(2) Unified Accounting System: Each county establishes an accounting director to specifically handle tax accounting. All taxes collected by the county government must be entered into the accounts. Its characteristics are as follows:</p>
<p>A. This account book only records the receipt and deposit of taxes and does not involve expenditures.</p>
<p>B. This system becomes the center of county government accounting.</p>
<p>C. The function of the accounting statements focuses on the deposit and storage of cash.</p>
<p>D. The account book focuses on statistics, which are used to assess the performance of collection.</p>
<p>(3) Establish County Treasuries: All counties that have established branches or offices of the Farmers Bank, Jiangsu Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications are entrusted as treasury agents. To date, 45 counties have been established, and they will need to be universally established in the future.</p>
<p>(4) Implement the Audit System: Pre-audit can be divided into budget audit and the issuance of payment orders. Post-audit involves the preparation of proof settlement documents and the audit of the final accounts. The audit of provincial and county funds is currently handled by two agencies:</p>
<p>Provincial - Implemented by the Audit Committee of the Provincial Government</p>
<p>County - Audited by the Department of Finance.</p>
<p>IV. Comparison of Past and Present Finances</p>
<p>Due to the failure to unify revenue and expenditure in the past financial situation of Jiangsu Province, the Department of Finance only managed a part of the finances, which made it impossible to collect complete statistics. Now, based on the revenue situation of provincial tax and land tax, comparing the past year with the 22nd year after reorganization, its revenue is as follows:</p>
<p>Actual revenue in the 21st year was about 9.85 million yuan.</p>
<p>Actual revenue in the 22nd year was about 11.97 million yuan</p>
<p>In addition to land tax, the largest revenue item is business tax. The business tax revenue in the 21st year was about 1.34 million yuan. The business tax revenue in the 22nd year was about 2.39 million yuan.</p>
<p>Judging from the past situation, the chaos in finance was not only due to the shortfalls in revenue, but the inability to establish a budget made the expectations for expenditure often far from reality. This illness caused the suspension of enterprises and the reduction of administrative efficiency. For example, the estimated revenue in the 21st year was 27 million yuan, while the actual revenue was only 18.75 million yuan. The budgeted revenue in the 22nd year was over 22 million yuan, and the actual revenue reached over 23 million yuan. (Including loans, about 28 million yuan.)</p>
<p>The revenue and expenditure situation of the province has been described above, and the revenue and expenditure situation of the county finances in various counties is difficult to obtain accurately and completely due to the lack of a unified accounting system in the past. In general, they are all cases of fictitious revenue and actual expenditure, and the accumulated losses over the years are considerable. The most contradictory aspect is that on the one hand, there is insufficient revenue for local enterprises, and on the other hand, the rural areas are desolate and urgently need to reduce the burden on the people. In fact, the difference between revenue and expenditure is far too great.</p>
<p>In terms of the past county financial administration, Jiangsu Province has undergone two changes. Its organization is</p>
<p>1. The county government is the main tax collection agency—the county government collects land tax deed tax (part of which is deposited into the province, and part of which is used for the county) and miscellaneous donations, and the education bureau and construction bureau collect part of the miscellaneous donations. The business tax, which was established not long ago, is collected by the Department of Finance.</p>
<p>2. The finance bureau is the main tax collection agency—the special point is that the finance bureau replaces the county government in collecting taxes (part of which is deposited into the province, and part of which is used for the county).</p>
<p>Both of the above systems have their drawbacks. Both are merely transfers of the power to collect taxes. The county magistrate can engage in corruption, and why would the bureau chief be any different? The shortcoming is the lack of supervisory agencies and checks and balances. Therefore, the Jiangsu Province finance is still in a state of chaos.</p>
<p>The author believes that in order for finance to move towards the right track, strict supervision should be implemented first to ensure that the chief accountant stands in a detached position. An accounting director is established outside the county government. At the same time, due to the establishment of the budget calculation system and the improvement of revenue and expenditure procedures, the duties of the accounting director are easier to perform, and the effect of the accounting system is apparent.</p>
<p>As a result of the reorganization, extravagant expenditures have been greatly reduced. On the revenue side, exorbitant and bothersome miscellaneous taxes and land tax surcharges have been abolished and reduced separately. The situation is shown in the following table</p>
<p>Abolish Exorbitant Taxes</p>
<p>Number of Instances　　Number of Types　　Amount of Silver</p>
<p>First Batch　　Forty-two Types　　100,174,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Second Batch　　Ninety-eight Types　　132,707,400 Yuan</p>
<p>Third Batch　　Eighty-eight Types　　95,521,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Note: The fourth batch of exorbitant taxes to be abolished is relatively large, about 800,000 yuan. The reorganization has been completed, and it will be abolished as soon as there are funds to offset it.</p>
<p>Reduce Land Tax Surcharges</p>
<p>County Name　　Surcharge　　Amount of Reduction</p>
<p>Yixing　　95,716,238 Yuan</p>
<p>Jinshan　　4,654,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Haimen　　29,432,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Qingpu　　2,990,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Wuxian　　22,480,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Lishui　　772,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Wujin　　28,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Total　　156,072,238 Yuan</p>
<p>In terms of the budget after the reorganization, the revenue and expenditure items of the counties are also unified. The total expenditure of the counties in the province in the 22nd year is estimated as follows:</p>
<p>1. Party affairs expenses are about 800,000 yuan</p>
<p>2. Civil affairs expenses are about 1.95 million yuan</p>
<p>3. Public security expenses are about 6.05 million yuan</p>
<p>4. Education and culture expenses are about 9.36 million yuan</p>
<p>5. Finance expenses are about 280,000 yuan</p>
<p>6. Construction expenses are about 2.48 million yuan</p>
<p>7. Health expenses are about 90,000 yuan</p>
<p>8. Social relief expenses are about 500,000 yuan</p>
<p>9. Grain storage expenses are about 300,000 yuan</p>
<p>10. Land survey expenses are about 1.43 million yuan</p>
<p>11. Debt expenses are about 50,000 yuan</p>
<p>12. Assistance expenses are about 1.31 million yuan</p>
<p>13. Reserve expenses are about 5.38 million yuan</p>
<p>There were no figures available for county local finance in the past. Since this reorganization, it is firmly believed that there is a path to follow. The above is a summary of the major steps in the reorganization of finance. Other efforts, such as unifying the collection of local donations, are also being made without reservation.</p>
<p>V. Expectations for the Future</p>
<p>For local finance to move towards the right track, it is not enough for those in charge of finance to implement measures to achieve great results. It is necessary for the people of the province to cooperate fully to achieve success. At the beginning of my tenure, I set the goal of financial transparency, so that everyone can trust the government. Only when they can trust the government can they implement government laws and regulations. Now that we have this foundation, we hope that all parties will work together. This is the first expectation.</p>
<p>The financial resources of the local area depend entirely on social order and market finance. If the people's livelihood cannot be stabilized and finance cannot be circulated, then the financial resources will definitely be in a state of distress. Conversely, the financial resources will definitely be abundant. The causal relationship between them is very obvious. The current policy guidelines of the provincial government are based on construction to promote the prosperity of social production, and on the other hand, to circulate finance and inject it into the rural areas. To promote the vitality of the collapsing social foundation, social order will gradually stabilize in the future, financial resources will be smooth, and all matters can be handled. This is the second expectation.</p>
<p>As for the various financial measures, those in charge are exhausting their intelligence to achieve considerable results. However, I am afraid that with a thousand considerations, there will still be one mistake. I hope that all clear-minded people in the country will always provide guidance to strive for perfection. This is even more deeply felt among all kinds of expectations.</p>

<h3>The Essentials of Promoting Domestically Produced Silk and Satin</h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>Over the past four or five years, the national crisis has grown increasingly urgent. It's not just that foreign aggression is severe and natural disasters are frequent, but the entire national economy has also fallen into a state of collapse and bankruptcy. As we approach the end of the year and welcome the new, shouldn't we, as Chinese people, seize this opportunity to rouse ourselves and strive for recovery? There is more than one way to rouse ourselves, but promoting domestic goods and reducing import surpluses is the most pressing task.</p>
<p>The Silk Industry Association and the Husha Art Society of this city, deeply aware of this, recently petitioned the central government to issue a nationwide decree that whenever commemorative weeks, important meetings, or joyous and sorrowful events are held, the dress code promulgated by the National Government on April 16, 1929, should be followed, and domestically produced silk ceremonial attire should be used. Today, on New Year's Day, Husha is also holding a ceremonial attire movement to showcase the elegance of domestically produced silk ceremonial attire. Clothing, food, shelter, and transportation are fundamental activities of people's lives, and proper attire can especially demonstrate the demeanor of a great nation. Chairman Chiang has taken it upon himself to promote the New Life Movement, saying, "Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame must be manifested in daily life." Unfortunately, among the Chinese people, regardless of age or gender, those who are ignorant of this principle are everywhere. Therefore, on holidays and festivals, when participating in grand ceremonies, some wear inappropriate attire, and some wear imported materials. Some even flaunt their attire in the streets, appearing pleased with themselves and losing all sense of national decorum. What a loss to national dignity! What an impact on the sales of domestic goods! In short, if this trend is not changed, it will not only be a disgrace to oneself but also harm people's livelihoods. Therefore, the promotion of this domestic silk ceremonial attire movement is highly commendable.</p>
<p>Chinese silk is inherently a noble material. Since the opening of trade with foreign countries, a great deal has been exported. However, in recent years, the techniques of sericulture, silkworm rearing, silk reeling, and silk weaving in our country have remained stagnant, with little improvement. Furthermore, with the prevalence of rayon and the competition from foreign silk fabrics, the overseas market has plummeted. As for the fashionable women in our country, they admire foreign goods and disdain domestically produced silk and satin. As a result, silk merchants are losing money, and silk factories are closing down everywhere. And how can we not worry about the millions of silkworm farmers who have gone bankrupt and workers who have lost their jobs? Thinking of this, I truly feel disheartened. The way to remedy this situation must depend on the awakening of the Chinese people. We must not abandon the sales of domestic silk because we love to wear Western suits. At this time of serious national crisis, even if we cannot endure hardship and prepare for battle, we should still promote patriotism and consider the national economy. Therefore, within our means, wearing domestically produced silk is our duty.</p>
<p>We also believe that promoting domestic silk need not be mutually exclusive with wearing Western suits. Those who love to wear Western suits generally do so because they are lightweight and attractive, not necessarily with the intention of abandoning their own culture and following others. Moreover, their choice of imported materials does not necessarily mean that they absolutely reject domestic products. Therefore, in order to break with convention, someone should try using domestically produced silk and satin to make Western clothing. At the same time, silk manufacturers should also strive to improve their products, so that their colors and textures are suitable for making Western clothing. In this way, the sales of domestic silk can be increased considerably. Otherwise, even if we absolutely prohibit Chinese people from wearing Western suits, the sales of domestically produced silk will still inevitably be encroached upon by foreign goods.</p>

<h3>Sun Ke Arrives in Beiping Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Beiping: Sun Ke arrived in Beiping this morning. He said, "The reason for my visit to Beiping this time is that my wife is ill in Beiping. I am taking advantage of the Legislative Yuan's recess to come north to visit her. I will return south with her in a week. Progress has been made on the issue of unity between the Southwest and the Central Government. Hu Hanmin can go to Beijing in two months because of the cold weather. I don't know the result of Wang Liangchou's visit to Chiang because I haven't met with him. The saying that Kong and Wang went to Hong Kong together is only seen in the newspapers. The saying that there will be changes in the central government after Hu enters Beijing is not accurate. Hu is a Standing Committee member of the Central Committee, and it is a matter of course for him to enter Beijing to serve. As for the saying that Hu will go abroad after entering Beijing, I cannot predict it before the facts are proven. The postal communication incident is a factual issue, and I have no feelings to express. The number of members of the Fourth Legislative Yuan is four less than the number of vacancies in the Third Session. It has not yet been decided whether to fill them."

<h3>Reports from the Central Government and National Government Memorial Weeks</h3>
<p>Yang Jie: Reflections After Inspecting Military Preparations</p>
<p>Lin Sen: Political Work Over the Past Year</p>
<p>Nanjing: The Central Government held its 163rd Memorial Week at 9:00 AM on the 31st. Ju Zheng, Yang Jie, Hong Ludaong, Li Ciwen, Zhu Jiqing, Fang Juehui, Li Zonghuang, and all staff members, totaling about 500 people, attended. Ju Zheng presided. Yang Jie reported "Reflections After Inspecting Military Preparations in Various Countries," stating that all European and American countries are striving to improve their military preparations and strengthen their national defenses. To establish a nation in modern times, it is not enough to be rich and strong; without military power, it is impossible to resist foreign aggression. However, to become rich and strong, we must first implement an industrial revolution and concentrate national power. Only then can military preparations be sufficient. If military power is insufficient, we must use diplomacy as a barrier. Strong diplomatic functions can serve as a route of aggression, while weak ones can serve as protection for the country. To achieve these two goals, appropriate intelligence and material resources are prerequisites. The world crisis is imminent. Modern warfare has been transformed into three-dimensional warfare due to the development of the air force. If war occurs, the entire country will be a battlefield, with no distinction between front and rear. Politicians in various countries are now using diplomacy to avoid war. At this juncture, our country must emulate the efforts of European and American countries to prepare military power and strengthen national defense in order to survive in today's world and overcome the current world crisis. The meeting adjourned at 10:00 AM. (Central News Agency Dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>Nanjing: The National Government held Memorial Week at 31:00 AM. He Yingqin, Zhang Ji, Chen Qicai, Wang Yongbin, Lin Xiang, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and other staff members from various ministries and commissions, totaling about 500 people, attended. After Chairman Lin led the ceremony, President Wang was originally scheduled to attend the report. Later, President Wang temporarily changed to Chairman Lin to report "Political Work Over the Past Year" due to attending the Executive Yuan's routine meeting, saying that today is the last day of 1934, which is also the last memorial week of this year. Now, the general report on political work over the past year is as follows: (1) Military Bandit Suppression: Military affairs depend on Chairman Chiang's proper deployment and the soldiers' obedience to orders. The bandits in Jiangxi have been completely suppressed. The remnant bandits who fled to Hunan, Guizhou, and Sichuan have been definitively planned, and a staff group has been formed to enter Sichuan to supervise the suppression. The remnant bandits can be suppressed in a short period of time. In addition, the public security in North China depends on Minister He's seat in the town and Chairman Huang's proper handling. Military officers and local authorities have also maintained their strength. Achievements have been made in receiving refugees, resettling wounded soldiers, and stabilizing local order. Military training in various places has made particularly significant progress in the past year. (2) Foreign Affairs: Our country's foreign policy is based on the Prime Minister's legacy of peace and struggle. On the surface, it seems that there has not been much progress in foreign affairs over the past year, but our country's peaceful attitude and credibility in diplomacy are well-received by all countries except those with ambitions. (3) Finance: After various provinces and cities abolished exorbitant taxes, the central government, in consideration of the inadequacy of local finance, allocated stamp tax funds to the localities to compensate. Regarding the silver issue, a few speculators previously smuggled silver exports. Since the Ministry of Finance stipulated anti-smuggling measures, the outflow of silver has ceased, and Minister Kong and the Shanghai banking community have explained it. The current financial situation has been stabilized. (4) Education: In recent years, the government has actively promoted production education, which has gradually become effective. In the past year, students sent to study abroad have focused on practical science to cultivate national production and construction talents. (5) Transportation: With the cooperation of the military and civilians, the construction of national highways has developed rapidly. The Longhai Railway has been opened to Xi'an, and the Huai River diversion project is in active progress. Important projects are expected to be completed in the short term. This is a general overview of the administration over the past year. Finally, he also stated that the construction of Beijing has made great progress. The development of education has made rapid progress, especially the eradication of opium, gambling, and prostitution, and the implementation of the New Life Movement have been quite effective. He also hoped that we will strive for reform in the coming year and improve the country's position. (Central News Agency Dispatch from the 31st)</p>

<h3>Retrospect of Eastern Provinces in the Past Year</h3>
<p>Farmers and Businessmen Bankrupt Under Japanese Iron Heels</p>
<p>Volunteer Army Continues to Rise Up and Resist Japan</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondent of the Chinese Alliance News Agency: Looking back at the Chinese people in the four northeastern provinces in 1934, they are still sinking under the Japanese slave policy. In March of this year, the puppet Pu Yi was proclaimed Emperor. September 18th was the 3rd anniversary of the September 18th Incident. On December 1st, the Japanese and puppets changed the four provinces into ten provinces without authorization (and divided East Mongolia into four provinces: East, West, South, and North), depriving the puppet provincial governors of their powers. The new administrative regions resembled Japanese prefectural governments. Recently, Japan has reformed the organizations in Manchuria and changed the security of the leased territory of Kwantung Prefecture and the railway affiliated areas to be managed by the military police, making all four eastern provinces under the iron heels of the Japanese military and political system. Rural bankruptcy is becoming more and more serious, and countless Chinese businessmen in the Northeast have gone bankrupt. Only the volunteer armies in the eastern part of Jilin and Liaoning provinces and the Heilongjiang province, numbering more than 100,000, continue their anti-Japanese work. Their patriotic sincerity and the spirit of not being seduced by fame and fortune have truly made the Japanese army tremble. In short, the people of the Northeast eagerly hope to regain their freedom as soon as possible, and their feelings are intense.</p>
<p>Dalian Correspondent of the Chinese Alliance News Agency: According to the "Third Round of Forecasts for This Year" compiled by the Joint Association for Surveying Agricultural Products, the autumn harvest in the eastern part of Liaoning and Jilin provinces has decreased dramatically this year. The following records the percentage of reduced income to investigate the general misery of the farmers in Northeast China under the iron heels of Japanese imperialism.</p>
<p>East Border Road, Along the Great Wall, Along the Shenji Road</p>
<p>Soybeans, 67, 64, 73</p>
<p>Other Beans, 14, 39, 74</p>
<p>Sorghum, 40, 78, 106</p>
<p>Millet, 32, 41, 63</p>
<p>Corn, 53, 17, 108</p>
<h3>Japanese Obtain Free Commercial Lease Rights in Northeast</h3>
<p>Immigrants Can Fully Operate in the Future</p>
<p>The Policy of Annexation is One Step Closer</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the "Manchukuo" case of Japanese commercial leased land, there have always been concerns about misunderstandings in various aspects, so the authorities prohibited recording it. This time, all negotiations on this issue have come to an end, and the ban has been lifted. The contents of the negotiations are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In the past, under the Zhang Zuolin regime, only Japanese were allowed to have commercial lease rights to land within Liaoning Province. Now, "Manchukuo" automatically recognizes commercial lease rights in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces.</p>
<p>(2) At the time of the establishment of "Manchukuo," there were concerns that large capitalists from mainland Japan would advance to it. It was heard that only 150,000 cho of commercial lease were allowed, and the limit could not be exceeded. However, this restriction will not be added this time, and Japanese are allowed to freely rent it.</p>
<p>(3) The above-mentioned Japanese "Manchu" commercial lease rights negotiations have been completely and satisfactorily resolved. From now on, the term of commercial land leased by Japanese in "Manchukuo" is 30 years (the term can still be renewed after the term expires).</p>
<p>Immigrants and other free points can be fully active in the future, so the close economic connection between Japan and Manchukuo in the future can be expected to develop. (Japan United Electric from the 31st)</p>
<h3>Key Points of the Northeast Postal Agreement</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Northeast mail will resume on January 10. Ordinary mail parcels and remittances will resume on February 1. The method of charging and the ambassador's martial arts office was officially announced in Japanese this morning. Outbound mail: Our post office has not issued an announcement because it has not received an order from the ministry. There are seven points in the draft agreement and the concordat. 1. One transfer bureau will be set up in each of the two locations of Yuguan and Gubeikou. 2. Outbound mail uses specially made stamps. 3. The envelope must not be stamped with the emblem of the pseudo-country. 4. All documents for parcel remittances completely remove the name of the pseudo-country. 5. Ordinary mail will begin on January 10, and parcel remittances will begin on February 1. 6. Yuguan is under the jurisdiction of the Hebei Post Office, and the Gubeikou Bureau is under the jurisdiction of the Ping Post Office. 7.

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the issue of postal communication in the Northeast, the Directorate General of Posts issued a notice that starting on the 10th, the main method for postal communication, transferring Northeast mail parcels, and at the same time, forming an organization to handle this matter, and making special stamps for the postal stamps used. The important place names on the postal stamps used for outgoing and incoming mail are in English, and the remote small places are noted in Chinese. As for the year, month, and date, the Gregorian calendar is used. As for the organizational methods of the postal company, it is in progress. (Special Dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japan believes that the pseudo-organization has not been recognized by various countries and has not joined the Universal Postal Union. It is quite inconvenient for the pseudo-organization to send letters to various places. Therefore, according to the resolution of the League of Nations on the passage of pseudo-Manchukuo mail on May 16 of this year, it will begin in 1935 to conclude postal treaties with various countries individually in the name of pseudo-Manchukuo. However, various countries do not recognize pseudo-Manchukuo, so the Japanese-pseudo postal agreement is concluded first. This postal agreement meeting will be held in Dalian in February, and Fujiwara, Director of the Postal Affairs Department of the Pseudo-Country's Ministry of Communications, will preside over everything. (Special Dispatch from the 31st)</p>

<h3>Bandit Suppression Provinces: County Governments Abolish Bureaus and Establish Departments</h3>
<p>Headquarters Issues General Outline of Measures</p>
<p>Revamping the County System to Enhance Efficiency</p>
<p>Implementation Required in All Areas Within Three Months</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The Nanchang Headquarters issued a general outline of measures for bandit suppression provinces regarding the abolition of bureaus and establishment of departments in county governments on the 31st, instructing the provincial governments of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, and other provinces to comply and implement them within three months. Reports and records are to be submitted for verification. The instruction stated: "Regarding compliance, it has been observed that county administration has deteriorated over the years, and no tangible results have been seen. Many attribute this to the incompetence of county magistrates. While this is a factor, the lack of centralized authority and incomplete organization within county governments are also contributing factors. The current county organizational law provides for only two departments within the county government, with Public Security, Finance, Education, and Construction Bureaus below them. The heads of these bureaus are often appointed by the respective provincial departments, forming their own systems and acting independently. They directly issue bureau orders downwards and report directly to their respective departments upwards. The county magistrate, presiding over them, cannot fully exercise supervisory and commanding powers due to not having personally appointed them and often being concerned about their backgrounds. Even between Bureau A and Bureau B, they only focus on individual development, lacking a unified will. The central focus of work in a county is therefore difficult to determine. Furthermore, with the establishment of these bureaus, the scale expands, inevitably leading to the establishment of sections and divisions and the indiscriminate placement of officials to create an impressive facade. Consequently, local finances are entirely allocated to support these redundant officials in the various bureaus, often proving insufficient, resulting in county budgets allocating only funds for organizational expenses and no funds for projects. Even with virtuous and capable individuals, how can they achieve results? This commissioner is deeply aware of this issue. When commanding troops in Jianghan in previous years, the headquarters of the three provinces stipulated measures for county governments to abolish bureaus and convert them into departments in order to consolidate authority and reduce expenditures, which has already been circulated for implementation. However, it has been observed that some provincial county bureaus have not yet been uniformly abolished. Now that the provincial government has implemented a joint office system, in order to enhance county administrative efficiency and ensure seamless and flexible coordination, the revamping of the county system is an urgent task. Therefore, after extensive consultation and detailed consideration, a general outline of measures for bandit suppression provinces regarding the abolition of bureaus and conversion into departments in county governments has been formulated and promulgated for implementation. All aspects of the county magistrate's authority and responsibilities, county government organization, and the handling of education, construction, public security, and finance have been carefully considered and improved appropriately based on actual circumstances. Summarizing the key points, the following should be clearly stated: Firstly, centralize authority and responsibilities. All existing bureaus under the county government are to be abolished, and their functions are to be incorporated into the management of the various departments within the county government. All county administrative measures are to be overseen by the county magistrate. The administrative personnel of the county government are also to be nominated by the county magistrate and approved by the provincial government to form a cohesive body, achieving effective coordination. Secondly, strengthen the organization. With the abolition of the bureaus, the county government's affairs will become more complex. The original organization should be appropriately expanded, with the addition of departments and personnel, and an increase in administrative expenses to attract talent and assist in governance. Thirdly, integrate education and construction. Education and construction are both priorities for national salvation today. The two are interdependent and closely related. This commissioner has repeatedly emphasized this in proclamations since last year, aiming to ensure that educational facilities meet the needs of local industries. Therefore, this outline stipulates that after the abolition of bureaus, education and construction affairs should be merged into one department to facilitate coordinated management. The administrative personnel of this department must be filled with specialized talent and may include supervisors and technicians to assist in the handling of affairs. Fourthly, strengthen police and defense coordination. Modern police systems are products of industrialized nations. Since their adoption in our country, they have only proven necessary in major cities and trading ports. In the towns and villages of various counties, where rural life prevails and residents have mostly lived in settled communities for generations, the forcible implementation of modern police systems for management is not only incompatible but also faces insufficient funds and personnel, making it impossible to perfect the organization and facilities. As a result, they merely adopt the name of the police while being staffed by disbanded soldiers, vagrants, or local ruffians who are ignorant of their duties, serving as tools to exploit the people and commit crimes. The harm caused is immeasurable. It is not known that since ancient times, our country's police administration has been entrusted to the Baojia system. The Baojia and militia units organized in the bandit suppression provinces are, in fact, the rural police. If their organization can be strengthened, appropriate training provided, and police officers assigned to supervise and guide them, the execution of all police duties can be assisted and promoted. Therefore, the reform of our country's police system cannot blindly imitate the superficial aspects of other countries but must adapt to local conditions to suit the current environment. Therefore, Article 6 of this outline specifically adopts the method of police and defense coordination. The existing public security organs and police in the towns and villages of various counties are to be abolished. Even the political police or judicial police secretly established in various counties should be largely eliminated, with strict limits on the number and appropriate salaries to prevent them from using their positions for extortion. Only police assistants are to be established in county governments, patrol officers in district offices, and police chiefs and officers stationed in key towns and villages, respectively obeying the orders of the district chiefs or joint Bao directors, commanding Baojia officials and militia units on-site to perform general police duties and be responsible for training Baojia members and militia, integrating self-defense organizations with police officer allocation. With only a small number of police officers strategically distributed, the entire county's police network can be constructed. Fifthly, unify tax collection. The numerous national, provincial, and local taxes are collected by various tax bureaus stationed in the same county, each operating independently. This not only wastes significant funds but also leads to extortion by tax collectors, with their unofficial collections often exceeding the government's revenue. Therefore, the more collection agencies, the greater the people's suffering. However, in cases of overdue payments, fines, or other necessary actions, the assistance of the county government is still required for enforcement. The current system's drawbacks are evident and require fundamental improvement. Therefore, Article 7 of this outline specifically stipulates the reform principles for county finances. Except for cases where a particular tax source in the area is exceptionally large and has been approved for the establishment of a special bureau for collection, all other provincial and county taxes are to be collected uniformly by the county government. A collection office may be established to handle this under the direction of the department in charge. The legally entitled collection fees are to be used to supplement county administrative expenses. At the same time, a county treasury is to be established as the agency for receiving, transferring, managing, and allocating funds. The collection office is responsible for collection but does not receive cash, while the county treasury is solely responsible for receiving cash and not for collection. With clear divisions of authority and responsibilities, past abuses such as unclear handover of collection personnel and embezzlement can be gradually eliminated, and the establishment of the county treasury can also effectively regulate local finances. The above five points are the main provisions of this outline and represent good rules for county administrative reform. It is hoped that the respective provincial governments will understand the purpose and strictly comply. In addition to forwarding this outline to the Executive Yuan for submission to the National Government for review and notification to the relevant departments for record-keeping and distribution, the attached measures for abolishing bureaus and converting them into departments in various bandit suppression counties are hereby ordered to the provincial governments for immediate compliance and implementation within three months. Reports and records are to be submitted for verification. This order is given."</p>

<p>Article 4: The county government shall have one secretary and three departments, numbered for identification, each with a department head. The functions of each department, except for education and construction affairs, which should be combined into one department to facilitate close cooperation, should be appropriately allocated according to actual needs. The number of personnel in each department shall be determined by the provincial governments of each province based on this outline, and the organizational regulations of the county government shall be submitted to this headquarters for approval and implementation.

<p>Article 5: County administrative personnel shall be nominated by the county magistrate and submitted to the provincial government for strict review and approval or record-keeping. Administrative personnel responsible for education and construction affairs must possess specialized qualifications or equivalent knowledge and experience and shall not be appointed otherwise. Supervisors and technicians may also be appointed to assist in handling education and construction projects.</p>
<p>Article 6: Except for municipalities and provincial capitals with thriving commerce and dense populations and major trading ports, the existing public security organs and police in the towns and villages of various counties are to be abolished. Instead, one police assistant shall be established in the county government, one patrol officer in each district office, and a number of police chiefs and officers shall be stationed in the joint Bao offices of important towns and villages. Under the command of the county government and the supervision of the district chiefs and joint Bao directors, they shall train Baojia members and militia in their respective areas, handle security, household registration, sanitation, transportation, and all police duties, and assign Baojia officials and militia units to perform local labor and assist in the execution of various police affairs. The training, appointment, and employment of police officers and the methods for assigning labor and assisting police affairs to Baojia units shall be formulated by the respective provincial governments and submitted to this headquarters for approval and implementation. Political police or judicial police established by county governments for collecting taxes, delivering messages, and handling cases shall, to the extent possible, be assigned to assist the district offices and Baojia personnel. The number of existing political police or judicial police shall be determined by the provincial governments according to the county's level and the complexity of affairs, with appropriate salaries and necessary travel expenses provided during official trips. They shall not extort the people, nor shall they establish additional unpaid political police, which would lead to extortion. Violators will be severely punished.</p>
<p>Article 7: County financial affairs shall be reformed in accordance with the following principles: (1) Provincial and county taxes to be collected by each county, except for cases where a particular tax source in the area is exceptionally large and has been approved for the establishment of a special bureau for collection, shall be collected uniformly by the county government. The responsible department may be entrusted with the collection or a collection office may be established under the direction of the department in charge. The legally entitled collection fees shall be used to subsidize county administrative expenses. The methods for unified collection, allocation of collection fees, and the organization of the collection office shall be determined separately. (2) The management of county financial revenues, expenditures, and custody, currently handled by the accounting section of the county financial committee, shall be separated and a county treasury established for independent management. In areas where a county treasury has already been established, the financial committee prescribed in Chapter 3 of the Regulations for Reorganizing County Local Finances in the current bandit suppression area shall be changed to a full-time auditing agency, with separate regulations to be determined. (3) The funds saved by the county government from the abolition of the various bureaus shall be transferred to the county's project expenses and district office establishment expenses. (4) The county's original education funds or construction special funds, under the unified collection and disbursement of the county treasury, shall still be kept separate and maintain their independent nature and shall not be diverted for other purposes.</p>

<h3>United States Considers Joining League of Nations with Conditions</h3>
<p>Democratic Member Plans to Propose Bill to Congress</p>
<p>State Department Indicates It Can Provide Assistance</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator Pope stated today that when the current Congress convenes, there will be another proposal for the United States to join the League of Nations. Pope also announced that he is drafting a joint proposal that will be submitted when Congress opens. The United States can join the League of Nations with a simple majority vote in both houses, instead of the usual two-thirds majority required in the Senate for treaties. Pope said that there is considerable support for the United States to join the League of Nations, so there is a greater chance of it passing in the current Congress than before. The joint proposal will include a reservation stating that after the United States joins the League of Nations, it will have no obligation to send troops to other countries under any circumstances. Although Pope expressed optimism, it is generally expected that his proposal will encounter fierce opposition, led by Senator Borah, the former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from the same state. Other expected opponents include Senators Norris and Johnson. It is recalled that when President Wilson returned to Washington from the Versailles Peace Conference and proposed that the United States join the League of Nations, these three were among those who opposed it. (National News Agency dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<p>(New York) According to a dispatch from the New York Times correspondent in Washington, the State Department is currently studying a bill to enable the United States to join the League of Nations. The reporter stated that Senator Borah, a Democrat from Ohio, will propose a bill at the beginning of the next session of Congress advocating for this matter. Borah's new bill will contain two reservations: (1) Although the United States is a member of the League of Nations, its obligations should be consistent with the provisions of the Kellogg-Briand Pact; (2) Although the United States joins the League of Nations, it cannot send troops to foreign countries under any circumstances. The State Department officially denies that the government is studying this matter but acknowledges that the State Department will provide assistance to Senator Borah in drafting this bill. However, Borah will be personally responsible for its submission to Congress. According to Borah, President Roosevelt believes that once the United States joins the League of Nations, the warmongering factions in various countries will suffer a fatal blow. In addition, Democratic Senator La Follette said that since the United States has already joined the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague, a proposal to join the League of Nations will be submitted to the Senate at the beginning of the next session of Congress.

<h3>US Congress to Reopen Soon; National Defense and Finance are Major Issues</h3>
<p>The Navy Department Will Request Increased Funding</p>
<p>Unemployment Requires Urgent Government Relief</p>
<p>(Washington) With Congress about to convene, relief and financial issues loom large in the capital. It is estimated that 15% of the nation's population relies on relief for survival. Other, less significant, foreign matters include the development of naval and Far Eastern issues, and their impact on the US position in the Philippines and Hawaii. Silver and inflationist members of both the House and Senate demand the passage of new currency reform bills to stimulate national commerce. However, they will face resolute opposition from conservatives, who claim that the new currency issued by the government will be used to repay old debts and will soon flow into the coffers of banks. However, they admit that President Roosevelt's difficult problem is veterans' allowances, as two-thirds of the members of both the House and Senate support the immediate payment of adjusted veterans' service certificates. The government acknowledges this matter and hopes to use strategy to seek a compromise (i.e., to pay cash immediately to truly impoverished veterans). It is said that the President has decided to ask Congress to stipulate methods for raising funds to pay veterans' allowances. If there is no such provision, the President will reject any allowance plan. It is said that the invincible naval plan caused by Japan's abandonment of naval treaties will stir up serious discussion. The Navy not only requires a huge increase in funding for shipbuilding, but also seeks increases in funds for fuel equipment and naval personnel. The Navy Department's proposed fuel bill for the 1935 naval maneuvers is said to be the highest expenditure since the European War. (30th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) The most important thing in US domestic affairs in 1934 is that the American people support the policies implemented by President Roosevelt. The reason why the American people are like this is that Roosevelt's policies have a radical trend, and some even say that they have a tendency to socialize. There is no doubt that the Economic Revival Bureau has lost its power. The method of regulating prices has now been abandoned, and even the industry regulations of various industries are more open than before. Roosevelt, worried about the increase in the budget deficit by the Conservative Party, allowed for budget cuts and indicated that he might stabilize the currency in the future. However, the issue of dollar stability and currency inflation does not seem to be a real issue at present. As for expanding lending, it is no longer mentioned. The prospects for business revival are better than a year ago, but there are two things that must wait a few months to know. One is whether the economic improvement is thorough, and the other is that the unemployment problem still lingers in the minds of the general public, and whether economic reform can solve it. The end of this year is the same as the end of 1933. According to estimates from all parties, there are still 7 million to 12 million unemployed people who need the government to maintain their lives. If their families are included, there are a total of 18 million to 20 million people. (30th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>US Prepares to Mention Far Eastern Politics at Naval Conference</h3>
<p>Japan is Alert and Preparing Countermeasures</p>
<p>Claims Not to Have Violated the Nine-Power Treaty</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The US believes that Japan's notification of the abandonment of the Washington Treaty is a new situation. Therefore, in order to deal with this matter, it may mention political issues in the Far East at the preparatory consultation to be reopened next year. Former US representative Davis once informally told representative Matsudaira that if Japan notified the abandonment, the US would not but mention political issues in the Far East at the same time. The diplomatic authorities are wary of the US attitude on this point. The superficial reason why the US must mention political issues in the Far East is that the Washington Treaty was signed simultaneously with the Nine-Power Treaty at the Washington Conference in the twelfth year of Taisho (1923), so the two are closely related. This is a one-sided view, but the diplomatic authorities decided to oppose the US view for the following reasons: (1) The signatories of the Washington Treaty and the Nine-Power Treaty are different, and judging from the time elapsed since the Washington Conference, the two are not related. (2) Notifying the abandonment of the Washington Treaty aims to achieve a new disarmament agreement. If it is related to political issues, this is because the US suspects Japan. (3) Japan has not only not violated the Nine-Power Treaty in the Far East, but also respects the Nine-Power Treaty and sincerely hopes that China's doors will be opened. It has repeatedly stated this, and it thinks that the US should have understood it. (4) In order to prevent the anxiety caused by the expiration of the Washington Treaty, Japan is also willing to participate in proposals to supplement or reconfirm the Four Treaties. However, it is absolutely opposed to discussing political issues with European and American countries and replaying the foolishness of the Geneva League of Nations General Assembly.

<h3>British and American Newspapers Criticize Japan for Destroying Naval Treaty</h3>
<p>(London) The liberal Manchester Guardian wrote an article commenting on Japan's announcement to abolish the Washington Naval Treaty. It sternly criticized the policies adopted by the Japanese government, concluding that "We now have two responsibilities: (1) to formulate a new agreement based on the principle of limiting naval armaments. This principle should be confirmed and not ambiguous in the slightest; (2) to restore an international system in the Pacific that ensures that the stronger has no covetous thoughts and the weaker has no fear of aggression." (31st Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) British morning newspapers commented on Japan's action of abolishing the Washington Treaty, most saying that the treaty still has two years before it expires, and during this period, a way to solve the difficulty of maritime disarmament can be found, so there is no need to worry about naval countries competing to build warships. The Morning Post said that the construction of larger battleships and aircraft carriers will cause the financial burden to exceed the security it provides. The Daily Telegraph said that according to the general opinion of world naval experts, Japan seems to have complete and impregnable security in its own waters, while other countries do not, so they have no choice but to seek complete security. The Times said that Japan's abolition of the treaty can of course be regarded as serious. Although Japanese diplomacy has given its abolition action a kind of conventional form, what cannot be concealed is that the lofty architecture of international coordination established thirteen years ago has been destroyed by this. However, Japan has announced its willingness to conclude a new treaty to replace the old treaty, and the recent negotiations have shown frankness and goodwill, so the establishment of a new treaty does not seem to be without hope. (31st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(New York) The New York Times commented on Japan's announcement to abolish the Washington Naval Treaty in an editorial entitled "Isolation is Not Glory," which mainly stated that "Japan has the right to announce the abolition of the treaty, which is indisputable, but at least Japan's actions have not taken into account other countries, which can be said to be inappropriate." The newspaper believed that the Washington Naval Treaty would expire at the end of 1936. According to Article 23 of the treaty, if the contracting parties do not announce the abolition two years before the expiration, it will continue to be effective until two years after a contracting party announces the abolition, at which time it will be deemed to have been abolished as a whole. Therefore, at most, it will be extended to the end of 1938, and the treaty will automatically announce its abolition. Japan could have waited until 1938. (31st Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russian Air Force Power</h3>
<p>Intensifying Training of Young Pilots</p>
<p>Vladivostok and Boli Have Balloon Squads Stationed</p>
<p>(Harbin) According to people coming from the Russian border, the Soviet Union attaches great importance to the air force, and its air force is particularly powerful. In addition to gathering combat, bombing, and reconnaissance aircraft on the border, there are also the following various air force auxiliary equipment: (1) In order to promote air force knowledge and training spirit, young men and women are taught how to use parachutes, and the results are very good. More than 90% of the trained men and women can use them. (2) There are five balloon squads stationed in Vladivostok and Boli, and they are still practicing on the border. (3) Training to use seaplane skis to make aircraft take off to increase the power of the air force in cold regions. (3) Forming a military sled team with a "flying sled", that is, a wind wheel is set in front of the sled and attached to the unit to increase mobility. (31st Hualian Telegram)</p>
<h3>Franco-Italian Negotiations Suffer Setback</h3>
<p>Opinions on Central European Guarantees Remain Far Apart</p>
<p>France Cannot Agree to Amend the Treaty</p>
<p>Laval's Trip to Rome Will Be Postponed</p>
<p>(Paris) French Foreign Minister Laval originally planned to visit Rome this week, but negotiations between France and Italy suddenly encountered obstacles, so the end of the French Foreign Minister's trip to Rome may be postponed as a result. According to French sources, difficulties have arisen regarding the guarantee of Austria's independence and Italy's sympathy for Hungary's request to amend the treaty. Hungary has requested an amendment because its land has been greatly reduced due to the provisions of the treaty. (31st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) Those in charge have made some explanations on the current state of negotiations between France and Italy, saying that the issue of amending the treaties of the European War has not been mentioned in the negotiations. What the two countries are consulting on is the respect for the independence and territorial integrity of the countries concerned. (31st Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The focus of the negotiations between France and Italy is on guaranteeing the independence of Austria and the organization of Central European peace institutions. The opinions of the two sides on such issues are very different. Unless they can be improved in the final hours, the differences of opinion between the two sides will probably not be eliminated. If so, Foreign Minister Laval's original plan to go to Rome before January 2 will have to be temporarily suspended, pending continued talks until he is confident that the trip to Rome will definitely lead to a successful and coordinated agreement before he can make the trip. What the French side is proposing is to conclude a convention, the purpose of which is to maintain the independence of Austria. This is what Austria hopes for regarding the guarantees given to it by the major countries. However, if the new countries that inherited the pre-war Austro-Hungarian Empire (i.e., Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, etc.) join in guaranteeing it because they support the French proposal, Austria is unwilling to accept it. In addition, Italy has proposed amendments to the French plan, which still clearly hold the view of amending the treaty, which France and the countries of the Little Entente cannot agree to. It seems that the views currently held by Italy must be improved before Laval can happily go to Rome. (31st Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3>Background of Kirov Case: Soviet Russia Conducts Strict Investigation</h3>
<p>More Than 100 People Executed One After Another</p>
<p>Attempt to Eliminate the Opposition in One Fell Swoop</p>
<p>(Moscow) Since the crimes of Kirov's assassin, Nikolaev, and his accomplices were announced a few days ago, the public thought that the government would hold a grand public trial, but unexpectedly, these people have now been tried rapidly and immediately executed, which is beyond the expectations of the general public. A total of 11 people were executed this time. Since the Kirov case occurred, a total of 119 people have died. According to Mr. Zhdanov, Kirov's successor, the prison is still not considered to be the end, because the government authorities intend to use this to eliminate the rebel party in one fell swoop. In addition, Mr. Agranov, an important official in charge of internal affairs in the Leningrad area, has now instructed the secret investigation department to continue to conduct strict investigations. The purpose is to determine whether the background of the Kirov case was solely presided over by the Leningrad Central Committee, or whether the party has branches in various provinces. It has been found that Agranov was the most terrifying leader in the Cheka organization in the early years of the revolution. Now that he advocates strict investigation, it can be seen that the matter is just beginning. (31st National Telegram)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Russian representative Kazirovsky has received a reply from his country regarding the Japanese proposal on the conditions for the transfer of the East Road. At 6:00 p.m. yesterday, he visited Mr. Rio of the Sino-Soviet Eurasian Bureau and talked until 10:30 p.m. On issues such as payment guarantees, the determination of goods payment prices, etc., he showed a slightly more conciliatory attitude than before. However, it is necessary to request instructions from his government again on the points asserted by Japan, and he hopes to meet again after receiving a reply. Director Togo immediately acknowledged and adjourned the meeting. The next meeting is scheduled to be held on January 2 or 3. If the Moscow government sends a satisfactory reply, the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Japan on the transfer conditions will generally come to an end. The meetings between Togo and Kazirovsky can be completed one or two times later, and the transfer negotiations have reached the stage of sorting out and drafting the text of the transfer treaty. If it goes smoothly, it may be signed in mid-February. (31st Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<h3>Using New Instruments to Detect Germs in Smallpox and Oral Diseases</h3>
<p>Zülich. It is said that there is a new discovery in German medicine recently. If this news is confirmed, it will become the most important invention in modern medicine. The size of some germs, such as the germs of smallpox, oral and foot diseases, etc., is so small that it cannot be seen by a precision microscope, nor can any film cause it to precipitate. Professor Bickelwald has recently invented a new instrument that can be used to determine the size of this microorganism. This instrument is a powerful centrifuge. When it rotates, it has a great force that can separate the smallest organism from the solution (the principle is the same as the centrifuge that separates milk). The size of the microorganism can be calculated by the centrifugal speed at which the microorganism separates. Using this method, Bickelwald proved that the length of the smallpox germ is one two millionth of a millimeter, and the germs of foot and oral diseases are one two hundred thousandth of a millimeter. Many other germs can also be measured by this method. (30th National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Tianjin Nankai Japanese-Built Airfield Case</h3>
<p>Japanese Celebrate Upon Completion of Construction</p>
<p>Tianjin Court Ruling Ineffective in Reality</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The negotiation regarding the Japanese airfield in Nankai Bali Tai, Tianjin, involved Zhang Ting'e, who previously dispatched Municipal Government Advisor Sun Runyu to visit the Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin, Kawagoe, and Vice-Consul Tanaka for multiple negotiations. However, no results were achieved. The Japanese side's construction had reached 70-80% completion ten days ago. The land, totaling ten hectares, seventy-five acres, seven fen, and four li, has been elevated, altering the original paddy field terrain. Section A comprises six hectares, and Section B comprises eighty acres. On Section A, three steel-framed, white iron aircraft hangars and two brick-and-mortar houses have been built, along with two gasoline storage depots. The perimeter is enclosed by a low fence with wire mesh. The original earthen road, constructed by our side, leading from the field to Nanguan outside Tianjin, has been directly repaired and filled with cinder by the Japanese side. This extends the road directly to the western end of Fukushima Street in front of the Haiguang Temple Barracks. Electric poles have been buried along the roadside, with electric and telephone lines connecting to the airfield. When the project was completed, the commander of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin, Umezu, and Consul-General Kawagoe, along with Japanese residents, held a celebration inside the field, outwardly claiming it was to celebrate the completion of a new sports field for the Japanese community. However, recent reconnaissance by our military experts all concluded that it was undoubtedly an airfield, with the hangars capable of accommodating at least twenty-four aircraft at a time. The construction of Section B is currently halted due to the cold weather and unsuitable mud conditions this winter, but it will continue when the weather warms up in the spring. The Municipal Government has reported this matter in detail to the Beiping Political Readjustment Committee, the Military Branch Committee, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is rumored that a solution may be difficult, or that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may directly negotiate with the Japanese ambassador. This is the proper procedure in diplomatic protocol, and all possible efforts have been made. Tracing back to the beginning of this case, the landlord, Guang Ren Tang, in order to absolve themselves of the responsibility of illegally selling national territory, filed a complaint with the Tianjin District Court, accusing the tenant, Zhang Shaoqing, of violating the land lease agreement by altering the original terrain (the original terrain being paddy fields). The court ruled last winter to cancel the original agreement, ordering the tenant to return the land. However, the complexity lies in who Zhang Shaoqing is and how the Japanese suddenly emerged as tenants. This issue cannot be effectively resolved by a mere piece of paper from a judicial body without extraterritorial jurisdiction. Therefore, the ruling is just a ruling, and the Japanese side continues construction as before. In the spring, Guang Ren Tang continued the previous lawsuit, still suing the court. After years of delay, the court both issued summons for the tenant Zhang Shaoqing and lacked the power to stop the construction of the Bali Tai project. Until today, a default judgment was issued. The main text of the judgment states, "The lease agreement between the original owner Qian Di and the defendant, concerning ten hectares, seventy-five acres, seven fen, and four li of paddy land in Nankai, is hereby terminated. The defendant shall return the aforementioned land to the plaintiff for management, and the altered land shall be restored to its original condition. Regarding the land return portion, provisional execution is granted. The litigation costs shall be borne by the defendant." This judgment, apart from not requiring service to the plaintiff, requires service to the defendant, but there is no place to deliver it. At the same time, the so-called provisional execution is also impossible to execute. Guang Ren Tang, before and after leasing the land, employed clever methods to evade responsibility. Beforehand, they strictly stipulated the contract to show that they were unaware that the tenant was Japanese. Afterwards, they repeatedly sued to cancel the original contract to show that they had no other intentions. However, when tracing the culprit, the hall is actually responsible for serious crimes.

<h3>League Head Suo Wang of Xilin Gol League Arrives in Beiping to Recuperate</h3>
<p>Weighing Over Three Hundred Pounds, Walking with Difficulty</p>
<p>Wu Peifu Has Brief Meeting with Suo Wang</p>
<p>Beiping Dispatch: Inner Mongolia's Xilin Gol League has two league heads, a main and a deputy. The main league head is Suo Wang, and the deputy league head is De Wang, the current Vice-Chairman of the Mongolian Political Council. Suo Wang has deep roots and prestige in Inner Mongolia. In recent years, due to obesity and illness, he has rarely been involved in political affairs. De Wang, a young up-and-comer, has thus come to the fore. During the Mongolian incident, Suo Wang was also a figure of attention from all sides. Recently, his obesity has worsened, with swelling in his limbs, weighing up to three hundred and twenty pounds, and walking with great difficulty. He needs assistance to move, so he came to Beiping from Xilin Gol League to recuperate. When he got off the train, four people supported him as he walked unsteadily. According to his attendants, the king dreamed of Sakyamuni, who told him that the water in Tangshan, fifty miles north of Beiping, is warm and that he must bathe there to cure his obesity. Suo Wang believed it was an indication from the Buddha, so he came from afar. He rested in Beiping for two or three days and then went to Tangshan to bathe. He also consulted famous Chinese medicine practitioners. In recent days, many people have visited his residence, but he has declined to meet most of them due to illness. He only spoke with Wu Peifu for over twenty minutes. Yesterday, over a hundred lamas from Yonghe Temple came in a group to request an audience, but the gatekeeper also declined on the grounds that Suo was ill and unable to meet. The lamas claimed they would not leave without seeing Suo Wang. After much explanation by Suo Wang's secretary and others, which took two hours, they finally dispersed. The authorities have been very courteous to Suo Wang," it is said. (December 29th)</p>

<h3>Retrospect of the New Life Movement Last Year</h3>
<p>Published by the New Life Movement General Association</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: The year 1934 of the Republic of China has ended. In the historical events of this year, the New Life Movement is truly one of the most precious pages. Looking back at the initiation and progress of the movement this year, it is truly inspiring and hopeful. Therefore, the general situation of the movement in recent years is summarized as follows: (1) The Genesis of the New Life Movement: The evolution of every nation is like sailing against the current; if you don't advance, you retreat. Our Chinese nation has five thousand years of culture, four hundred million people, and thirty-five million square miles of land. It was originally the most ancient civilization in the world. However, in recent times, it was first mistaken due to the incompetence and stagnation of the late Qing Dynasty, and then hindered by the oppression and trampling of various imperialist powers. The national spirit declined, and national affairs became increasingly difficult, leading to "decadent" and "romantic" phenomena. The twilight years deepened, and there was much degeneration. Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the pioneer of our Chinese nation, realized the crisis of our nation. He deeply believed that in order to promote political reconstruction of the country and revive the nation, he advocated revolution for decades, and the Republic of China has been established for more than twenty years. Unfortunately, Mr. Sun died prematurely, and the great cause of the revolution has not yet succeeded. The reason is due to the intensified oppression of various imperialist powers, making it impossible for us to raise our heads, and the decadence and stagnation of our nation, failing to participate in the cause and bear heavy responsibilities, is the greatest reason. Our revolutionary leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, based on the principle of "pacifying the interior before resisting foreign aggression" and "reforming the heart before revolution," launched the New Life Movement in February 1934 in Nanchang, the location of the General Headquarters. He sought a life revolution for all our citizens, using the simplest and most urgent methods to eliminate the habits of our people that are incompatible with the times and the environment. He aimed to revitalize the nation and make it a fundamental movement for the revival of our nation. The New Life Movement is an extremely ordinary and practical movement. It does not seek deep textual explanations, nor does it want to sing high-sounding tunes in vain. The initial movement focused only on "propriety" and "cleanliness."</p>
<p>(2) Initial Progress of the New Life Movement: The New Life Movement, inspired by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, began its initial trial in Nanchang. The initial governing body was called the Nanchang New Life Movement Promotion Association. At the end of February, the first meeting of executive officers was held, and various regulations were gradually formulated. The movement proceeded in three stages: first, propaganda; then, guidance; and finally, inspection. Civic rallies and lantern parades were held to attract the attention and awareness of the general public. The "propriety" and "cleanliness" movements were then carried out step by step according to the planned plan.</p>
<p>(3) Subsequent Rise in Various Parts of the Country: After the New Life Movement was implemented in Nanchang, it achieved remarkable results in a short period. The aspects of "propriety" and "cleanliness" were greatly different from the past. All parts of the country, due to the eagerness to revive the nation and the enthusiasm to eliminate the old and establish the new, started the same movement under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. The first to follow were the capital and Shanghai. Then came Jiangsu, Hebei, Hubei, Fujian, Anhui, Henan, Zhejiang, Hunan, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Chahar, Suiyuan, Ningxia, Qinghai, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Xikang, and Beiping City. This movement developed vigorously in a short period of time, reaching major cities and remote villages, which was beyond initial expectations.</p>
<p>(4) Promulgation of the Outline of the New Life Movement: The New Life Movement swept the country in a few months, which greatly encouraged and comforted the promoters of the New Life Movement in Nanchang. However, the progress was too rapid, and shortcomings and malpractices inevitably arose. In order to clarify the theory of the New Life Movement and guide the methods of the New Life Movement, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek specifically ordered the drafting of the Outline of the New Life Movement and published it to the people of the country as a guideline. The outline included the main purpose of the New Life Movement, the understanding of the New Life Movement, the purpose of the New Life Movement, and the content of the New Life Movement, such as propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, as well as food, clothing, housing, and transportation. In addition to a concise and thorough explanation, the methods of the New Life Movement, the responsibilities of the movement, and the progress of the work were also detailed. As a result, the New Life Movement, which had been developing spontaneously, was brought into line and proceeded in an orderly manner.</p>
<p>(5) Establishment of the New Life Movement General Association and Reorganization of the New Life Movement Associations in Various Cities, Counties, and Railways: Due to the rapid progress of the New Life Movement, the organizations in various places inevitably suffered from the drawbacks of some people acting arbitrarily and unevenly. In order to unify the movement and strengthen the organization, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek established the New Life Movement Promotion General Association in Nanchang on July 1st, and took office as the chairman. He also formulated the organizational outline of the New Life Movement Promotion Associations in various provinces, cities, railways, and counties in Jiangxi (because the movement in various counties in Jiangxi was directly presided over by the General Association), and notified the various provincial, city, county, and railway associations to reorganize accordingly. Those that have completed the reorganization include the capital, Shanghai, Beiping, and the three cities, Hubei, Hunan, Shanxi, Henan, Shandong, Fujian, Anhui, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Gansu, Chahar, Suiyuan,</p>
<p>Hebei, Qinghai, and other provinces. The Pinghan, Jiaoji, Longhai, Zhengtai, Jinpu, Nanxun, Beining, and Jinghu-Huhangyong railways, and more than fifty counties in Jiangxi, such as Nanchang, Xinjian, Jiujiang, and Poyang, are all under the guidance of the General Association and are carrying out the movement separately.</p>
<p>(6) The Purpose and Steps of the Work: The New Life Movement is a simple movement to change customs and correct current malpractices. It does not make excessive propaganda, nor does it engage in superficial displays. It does not aim to transform the habits of the entire nation all at once, but seeks gradual progress for each individual. Therefore, it consistently takes a trial attitude, starting from the near and extending to the far, and extending from oneself to others. The work steps focus on Nanchang, followed by the counties in Jiangxi and the capital cities of the country, and are gradually promoted in order to ensure the practical progress of the movement. Based on this purpose, the General Association not only formulated the General Outline of the First Phase of the Work Plan of the General Association, but also formulated the Principles of the First Phase of the Work Plan of the Provincial, City, County, and Railway Associations, and distributed them to the various associations for implementation.</p>
<p>(7) Promotion of the New Life Movement in Nanchang: A. Scope of Promotion: The General Association, based on the principle of establishing prestige from near to far, focuses on Nanchang. The scope of work is initially divided into the following eight items: (1) Promotion of the New Life Movement in various government agencies; (2) Promotion of the New Life Movement in various public places; (3) Promotion of the New Life Movement in various shops; (4) Promotion of the New Life Movement in various public utilities; (5) Improvement of city appearance; (6) Promotion of the New Life Movement in social organizations; (7) Research on the reform of etiquette; (8) Promotion of the New Life Movement in various factories. B. Promotion Cadres: The New Life Movement depends on the ability to be implemented. Therefore, the promotion cadres are extremely important. The promotion cadres used by the General Association include the following: (1) Jiangxi Youth Holiday Service Corps: This corps is organized under the guidance of the General Association. In addition to twelve branch corps in Jiujiang, Linchuan, Pingxiang, Poyang, and other counties, there are more than 1,900 people in Nanchang City who are working hard to serve during the holidays, achieving remarkable results. (2) Shop Service Staff: Each shop with two or more employees appoints a service staff member, who is issued an armband by the General Association and taught separately, totaling more than 1,600 people. (3) Female Civil Servant Service Corps: Women are the backbone of the New Life Movement in the family. Therefore, the General Association organizes a service corps of female civil servants in Nanchang, and their mission is to start from themselves and then from their families, extending the service from a small number of families to the entire society. (4) Constitution and Police Organization Inspection Team: The constitution and police are the most effective cadres in promoting the New Life Movement. Therefore, the Nanchang constitution and police are divided into several groups, led by personnel dispatched by the General Association, to patrol and inspect and advise. (5) Civil Servant Service Corps: Each government agency in Nanchang City organizes a service corps of civil servants, who not only promote the New Life Movement in the agency, but also teach the nearby streets and markets. The organization is currently underway. C. Practical Demonstration: In addition to promoting various movements, the General Association also seeks various practical demonstrations, in order to encourage citizens to emulate and silently transform. Therefore, the following matters are carried out: (1)筹 Establishing Public Canteens: The restaurants in Nanchang are not only expensive, but also do not meet the conditions of simplicity and cleanliness, which is harmful to the health and economy of the general public. Therefore, the Association decided to establish public canteens in five locations in Nanchang City, east, west, south, north, and central. The construction of the houses and the setting of furniture should meet the conditions of simplicity and cleanliness. The food should be of low value and rich in nutrients, and each meal should not cost more than ten cents. After there is a clue, it will be contracted to merchants for operation. The General Association will then select another location to open. This will be promoted in this way, with the aim of completely transforming all the restaurants in the city and achieving the requirements of the New Life. (2)筹 Establishing Male and Female Bathhouses: The bathhouses in Nanchang with slightly better architecture are expensive and cannot be afforded by the general public. Most of the ordinary ponds are dirty and expensive. There are no female bathhouses in the entire city, and it is winter and the weather is cold, so women have no way to bathe. Therefore, the Association decided to establish male and female bathhouses in five locations in Nanchang City, east, west, south, north, and central. The equipment in the bathhouse should be clean and hygienic, and each person will only be charged five copper coins for bathing. (3)筹 Establishing Public Cemeteries and Cremation: Various places in our country have always valued burial, which wastes land and money, and there is a real need for reform. Therefore, the Association stipulates cremation methods and replies to the Jiangxi Provincial Government to designate the forest hills between Nanchang Niuxing Railway Station and Meiling to build public cemeteries as a demonstration. (4) Designated New Life Practice Areas: For demonstration purposes, the General Association designates one or more locations in government agencies, schools, party headquarters, and streets and markets as New Life Practice Areas. (1) Government agency: Nanchang Municipal Committee. (2) Schools: No. 1 Middle School, No. 2 Middle School, Girls' Middle School, No. 2 Vocational School, Girls' Vocational School. (3) Party headquarters: Provincial Party headquarters. (4) Streets and markets: West Main Street. (8) Promotion of the New Life Movement in Jiangxi Province: A. Promotion Steps: Since the movement in various counties in Jiangxi is directly presided over by the General Association, the General Association has decided on three promotion steps: (1) Counties along the Nanxun Railway with convenient transportation; (2) Counties along various highways with convenient transportation; (3) Various counties that have launched the New Life Movement. B. Overview of the Movement: More than fifty counties that have already launched the movement are following the principles of the work plan formulated by the General Association, formulating detailed work plans according to the actual needs of each county, and working hard to carry them out.</p>
<p>(5) Promotion of the New Life Movement in Various Provinces, Cities, Railways, Shipping Lines, and Overseas Chinese: A. Various Provinces and Cities: The General Association formulates work plan principles for all provincial and city associations that have been reorganized and established, in order to ensure consistency in promotion. Detailed promotion items are formulated by each province and city according to actual needs. The work is now progressing consistently. B. Various Railways: Various railways are the national transportation lifeline, which is of great importance to the lives of passengers. After the General Association reorganized the New Life Movement Associations of various railways, it issued work plan principles, and each railway formulated its own detailed items for implementation. Now all railways have made rapid progress. C. Various Shipping Lines: Various domestic shipping lines, especially those operated by foreign merchants, are quite inconsistent with the requirements of the New Life. In order to thoroughly reform, the General Association plans to establish New Life Movement Associations for various shipping lines. However, due to the deep-rooted malpractices of various shipping lines, it is not possible to reform without reforming their system and economic relations. It is currently consulting with its competent authorities. D. New Life Movement of Overseas Chinese: After the New Life Movement was launched in Nanchang, overseas Chinese also wrote to request the establishment of New Life Movement Associations and followed up with promotion. In response to the needs of the facts, the General Association specially formulated the Organizational Outline of the New Life Movement Associations of Overseas Chinese, which was ordered by the Central Organization Committee and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to be responsible for the General Branch and various consulates. (10) Further Movement Preparation: The initial work of the New Life Movement lies in the "propriety" and "cleanliness" that are easiest for the people of the country to implement. However, the highest goal of the New Life Movement is definitely not limited to this. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said in the outline, "How can the life of the people be noble? It is called the art of life. How can the life of the people be rich? It is called the production of life. How can the life of the people be consolidated? It is called the militarization of life." This art of life, production of life, and militarization of life are the highest requirements of the New Life Movement, and are also the further work of the entire movement. In order to carry out this work, the General Association established a research group for militarization, production, and art, to conduct research and draft implementation plans. The various plans have now been drafted, and the second step will be promoted at the beginning of 1935.</p>
<p>(11) General Review of This Year's Movement: Since the New Life Movement was launched in February of this year, what has been the progress and effectiveness? There are facts that can be consulted, so there is no need to repeat them. However, the course of this year's movement can be clearly divided into several periods, namely (1) from the launch of the New Life Movement in February to the establishment of the General Association on July 1st, it was the period of the launch and free development of the New Life Movement; (2) from the date of the establishment of the General Association on July 1st, it was the period of unifying the national movement and streamlining the work steps, gradually transitioning from propaganda to practical action; (3) Since the beginning of this bottom, the New Life Movement has gradually moved from the initial stage of "propriety" and "cleanliness" to the further promotion of the militarization, production, and art of life. In short, life has no end, and the New Life Movement has no end. In other words, this movement will advance with our nation and our country. Whether our nation can be revived and whether our country can be strong depends entirely on whether we can work hard on this movement. The country has its efforts to go to (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Qingdao's Difficulty in Eradicating Opium</h3>
<p>Japanese Operate About Two Hundred Opium Dens</p>
<p>Over One Thousand Addicts Detained in Rehabilitation Centers</p>
<p>Qingdao Dispatch: Since the Nanchang Headquarters issued the "Provisional Regulations for the Strict Prohibition of Potent Drugs," all provinces and cities have taken swift action to eradicate them within a specified period. However, due to Qingdao's special circumstances, although the authorities have repeatedly issued orders and strictly prohibited opium, the number of opium offenders has not decreased. The Drug Rehabilitation Center established by the Public Security Bureau is overcrowded with drug offenders. According to investigations, there are about two hundred opium dens set up by Japanese and Korean vagrants in Qingdao. If each household has at least twenty addicts, then there should be more than four thousand people in total. The Public Security Bureau has difficulty cracking down, and the rehabilitation center cannot accommodate so many people. Eradicating opium within a specified period is difficult. Therefore, the various difficulties have been reported to the Municipal Government for review. The report states: "Following Instruction No. 7953, it is noted that potent drugs such as morphine are extremely harmful. Repeated orders have been issued to prohibit them. However, due to long-standing complacency, the results are still minimal. If this continues, the harm will be profound. Recently, the Beiping Political Affairs Council forwarded the Nanchang Headquarters' order to issue the 'Provisional Regulations for the Strict Prohibition of Potent Drugs.' Copies of the original documents have been issued for compliance and have been circulated to all on record. Now, from the date of receipt of this document, you must eradicate all opium within one month. You are instructed to direct your subordinates to earnestly investigate and prohibit opium in order to ensure the completion of the task. If there is favoritism or negligence, you will be held accountable for shielding criminals and will not be shown any leniency. You are to comply immediately and instruct your subordinates to be aware of the same." Upon receiving this, we are deeply aware of Your Excellency's emphasis on humanitarianism and the determination to eliminate opium. We dare not fail to comply diligently. We immediately instructed all districts under our jurisdiction to comply. At the same time, we negotiated with the Japanese Consulate to investigate and prohibit the morphine dens set up by Japanese and Korean vagrants so that they can assist each district in conducting thorough searches at any time. Since the implementation, two months have passed. According to the total number of people arrested in each district, since the implementation of the 'Provisional Regulations for the Strict Prohibition of Potent Drugs' on September 12, it has reached more than eight hundred. Except for those who have been discharged from rehabilitation, the total number of people currently detained in the two branches is no less than four hundred. The morphine dens set up by Japanese and Korean vagrants in each district have been searched more than ten times with the cooperation of the Japanese Consulate. As a result of repeated negotiations, eleven fewer dens exist than before. According to the report from the consulate, twelve families of Japanese and Korean vagrants who were engaged in this business have now been sent back to their home countries. The fines collected recently in this regard have also reached more than two thousand two hundred and eighty yuan. This is a general overview of the active opium prohibition in the past two months. However, Your Excellency has set a deadline of one month for eradication. Now, two months have passed. Although there have been considerable results, the eradication period is still far away. The Director is anxious day and night and deeply fearful. However, in tracing the cause, there are things that must be clearly stated to Your Excellency. According to reports from various districts, there are more than two hundred opium dens set up by foreigners in this city. Due to strict prohibition recently, eleven have been reduced, leaving more than one hundred and ninety. If each household has at least twenty addicts per day, then there should be four thousand people, not including those who send people to buy opium. According to the current number of people allowed in the two branches of the Bureau's Drug Rehabilitation Center, which is three hundred, we have already squeezed in up to four hundred, which is already extremely crowded. Even if we can accommodate up to four hundred people according to the previous situation, the average rehabilitation period for each person is two months. Therefore, it will take two years to complete the process. Moreover, the number of addicts in the city is more than this. Relapses and new addictions after rehabilitation are even more unavoidable. Therefore, to achieve temporary clarity, just the current opium offenders in this city who should be arrested at the same time are also more than one thousand. Without planning large-scale housing separately, there is no place to accommodate them. Once the accommodation location can be arranged, then we will seriously negotiate with the Japanese Consulate. All morphine dens set up by Japanese and Korean vagrants that have been discovered must be ordered to return to their home countries. Newcomers must not engage in this business again. If we proceed so strictly, there may be hope for eradication. The Director's ignorant view dares not be silent. If there is anything appropriate, please review and approve." Subsequently, the Municipal Government issued instructions stating, "Noted. Since the number of people is crowded and there is no way to settle them, you should immediately prepare suitable housing and arrest and accommodate as many people as possible. You are still urged to instruct each branch bureau to actively handle the matter and eradicate opium within a short period. If any of your subordinates are perfunctory, they will be held accountable for shielding criminals and will not be shown any leniency. You are to comply immediately and instruct your subordinates to strictly abide by this and not violate it." (December 29)</p>
<h3>Staff Delegation of the Headquarters Arrives in Hankou</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Enter Sichuan to Supervise the Suppression of the Communist Bandits</p>
<p>He Guoguang Discusses the Delegation's Mission</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: Commander-in-Chief Chiang, in order to eliminate the Red bandits in Sichuan Province, specially formed a staff delegation to Sichuan to command the various armies to suppress them. He Guoguang was appointed as the Director, and Yang Jihui as the Deputy Director. They were organized and established in Ganzhou. On the 29th, they departed from Nanchang on a special train on the Nanxun Railway. They arrived in Xunyang at noon, transferred to the Fuyang steamship to go west, and arrived in Hankou at 2 p.m. on the 30th. There was also a company of military police who arrived on the Minzu steamship. At that time, it was drizzling, and the river was rough. Various military and political figures braved the rain to welcome them at the China Merchants Wharf. The military police were on guard and were extremely strict. He Guoguang immediately disembarked and stayed at the Yangtze River Hotel. Accompanying personnel included Senior Staff Officers Li Baihua, Tian Xiangfan, Fan Shihong, Wang Mengxiong, Nie Guang, Director of the General Affairs Office Bai Liang, Deputy Director Gao Jianlong, Director of the First Division Xiao Lin, Deputy Director of the Second Division Li Weilun, Secretaries Xia Shilin, Du Xiangshu, Shen Huanian, Colonel Staff Officers Cai Wensu, Lu Guan, Huang Yulin, Director of the Medical Office Wang Lantian, etc. The soldiers included the Signal Platoon, Transportation Platoon, and Military Police Company, totaling more than seven hundred people, who did not disembark. As for the Deputy Director of the delegation, Yang Jihui, he was originally in Sichuan Province. The Director of the First Division, Liu Yiren, and the Director of the Second Division, Wang Youyong, were in Shanghai. The Director of the Political Training Office, Kang Ze, was in Ganzhou. Liu and Wang took the opportunity to fly to Hankou. Kang first went to Xingzi County to assemble the political training personnel to go west. The number of staff members in the office and the political training personnel in various armies has been set at three hundred and sixty, and they will enter Sichuan one after another. After He arrived in Hankou, he was entertained that evening by Zhang Xueliang, He Dagun, He Chengjun, Xu Yuanquan, Shangguan Yunxiang, Liang Guanying, Xiao Zhichu, Hao Mengling, Ye Peng, etc. During the banquet, military matters related to suppressing the bandits were discussed. He decided to stay in Hankou for four days and take the original steamship to Yichang on the 3rd of next month, where he will transfer to another steamship to enter Sichuan. Deng Hanxiang, the Commissioner of Sichuan Province and concurrently the Secretary-General, was originally scheduled to go with He, but because Chen Shaojuan, the special financial commissioner stationed in Sichuan, was about to fly west, he changed his plans and flew to Sichuan with Chen on the 2nd. Sichuan's finances are extremely chaotic and urgently need to be reorganized in advance. According to He Guoguang, the staff delegation is a special agency established by the Military Affairs Commission's Headquarters, responsible for planning and guiding the suppression of the bandits. The staff delegation's organization is divided into four divisions: First, Second, General Affairs, and Political Training. The personnel of each division, except for the Political Training Office, have all been assigned to come to Hankou. The personnel of the Political Training Office will be led by Kang Ze and will arrive in Sichuan within ten days to assemble. We will depart from Hankou on the 3rd and will not stop along the way. After arriving in Sichuan, we will station in Chongqing. When necessary, we will first go to the front to inspect. All orders regarding the bandit suppression operations will be drafted by this delegation and issued in the name of the Commander-in-Chief, co-signed by Liu Xiang, the Commander-in-Chief. After the Ganzhou bandits were encircled, a limited number of them fled to Hunan and Guizhou. They suffered heavy losses after being blocked and suppressed by the armies of Hunan, Guizhou, and Guizhou. Although they have plans to flee to Sichuan, they can be wiped out in one fell swoop. There are no major Red bandit forces in Jiangxi. A small number of remnants are hiding in the mountains south of Qiehuang and north of Ningdu. The local garrison will enter the mountains to search and suppress them. There is no need to set up a Headquarters in Nanchang, and it will be dismantled. The deadline for receiving documents will be the 15th of next month, and it can be concluded by the end of the month. The personnel of this delegation are all transferred from the Headquarters, etc. (December 30)</p>

<h3>Giant Snake Discovered in Tangshan</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) A giant snake was discovered on the morning of the 29th on the right bank of the Dou River, upstream of the Da Hong Bridge in Tangshan. It was over two zhang long and as thick as a telegraph pole. It moved from east to west, followed by countless small snakes. It stopped after about two hours and entered the water at the Yuehe area. Over a hundred people saw it and were amazed. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<h3>The Disaster Situation in Changyuan, Puyang, and Dongming Counties in Southern Hebei is Extremely Serious</h3>
<p>A Total of 270,000 Disaster Victims</p>
<p>Dozens of People Freeze to Death and Starve to Death Every Day</p>
<p>Beijing Dispatch: The Yellow River in Hebei Province has breached its banks for years, and disasters have occurred repeatedly. Changyuan, Puyang, and Dongming counties have all suffered a major calamity. The once fertile fields have all become flying sand and vastness. The two-year flood broke out, and clothes and belongings were all washed away. The mulberry fields have become a sea, and there is no hope for sowing. Many villages and houses have become ditches and ruins. The three major elements of clothing, food, and shelter are all unsustainable. At this time of freezing weather, how can they live? Therefore, dozens of people freeze to death and starve to death every day. Even the formerly wealthy families have now become beggars. The tragic situation in the disaster area is no less than a human hell. The disaster victims are begging for relief, like a great drought looking for clouds and rain. Therefore, the three counties recently sent Tian Kongnai as a representative to Beijing to petition for relief in order to save hundreds of thousands of disaster victims who are about to die. The document presented to the Central Government is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"Reporting that the three counties of Changyuan, Puyang, and Dongming in Southern Hebei have suffered severe Yellow River disasters for years, and the disaster victims are in urgent need of relief. Please quickly allocate a large amount of relief funds to save the people's lives and avoid taking risks. This year, the Yellow River mouth in Changyuan County, Hebei Province, has breached again, and Changyuan, Puyang, and Dongming counties have suffered floods again. It is estimated that the disaster area in Changyuan County reaches more than four hundred villages, with more than 140,000 disaster victims. The disaster area in Puyang is more than two hundred villages, with 100,000 disaster victims. Dongming has fifty-nine villages with more than 27,000 disaster victims. According to statistics, there are more than 270,000 disaster victims in the three counties. The water depth in the disaster area ranges from four or five feet to eight or nine feet, and the area is as wide as more than 300,000 square li. Houses were washed away by the floods, and fields became swamps again. The treasury was empty, and clothes were gone. The disaster situation is more severe than last year, more than doubled. First, the breach of the banks for years has made it impossible for the people to live. Moreover, the disaster victims are still in the floodwaters. Today last year, the Yellow River water in Changyuan had receded, and a lot of autumn wheat was planted. But today, the city is surrounded by floodwaters, which are boundless. Moreover, the Yellow River water has been rising recently, and the floods have not stopped. At this time of severe cold, the disaster victims have lost all hope for clothing, food, shelter, and transportation. The cries for help are overflowing the fields. Recently, dozens of people have been freezing to death and starving to death every day. The situation in the disaster area is no less than a human hell. It is noted that Hebei Province has had many misfortunes for years, and its financial expenses have already fallen short of revenue. In addition, the subsidies for the Eastern War Zone and the assistance to the Beiping Political Committee's expenses are even more stretched every month. According to Hebei Province's financial expenses, maintaining the status quo is still insufficient, let alone providing relief. The relief funds obtained from the Yellow River Disaster Lottery are very few, only a drop in the bucket. There are too many disaster victims, which is really difficult to relieve. Therefore, repeated telegrams have been sent, but no allocation has been received, and we are deeply regretful. Moreover, the folk customs in Southern Hebei are strong. If no relief is provided, hundreds of thousands of disaster victims will inevitably take risks once they are forced by hunger and cold, endangering the political situation. In the spring of this year, various slogans were discovered. Fortunately, the authorities maintained their strength and were not harmed. At this time when the disaster victims are hopeless for survival, if someone uses this opportunity to engage in incitement, future hidden worries must be prevented in advance. Therefore, representatives of the three counties have gone to Beijing to petition, so that the lower-level situation can be reported to the higher levels. It is noted that the Central Government's plan for providing relief to various provinces has been discussed and decided at the Central Political Affairs Conference in November. All service personnel in military, political, and educational institutions in various provinces who earn more than fifty yuan per month will donate 2% of their salary, from November to April 24th. This shows the Central Government's great intention to provide relief to various disaster areas. Hebei Province has not received any allocations for relief in the disaster area since the Yellow River mouth breached again in August of this year, which is inevitably biased. Hebei Province's donation to aid relief has been implemented since November. Can the funds donated by Hebei Province be retained by this province in order to distribute them to various disaster areas in this province? Or should a large amount of relief funds be quickly allocated to save the hundreds of thousands of disaster victims who are about to die? We are extremely fearful and await orders. If what has been reported is appropriate, we respectfully request your review and approval, and quickly allocate funds to benefit the disaster victims. This would be a great act of kindness. Respectfully presented to the President of the Executive Yuan Wang, the Minister of Finance Kong, and the Chairman of the National Government's Yellow River Flood Relief Committee and Relief Affairs Committee Xu."</p>
<h3>Songjiang Agencies Take a Holiday for New Year's Day</h3>
<p>All agencies, schools, and public organizations in this county will gather at the county government at 8 a.m. on New Year's Day to celebrate, and will take a three-day holiday. All stores will celebrate the occasion by hanging flags. They will also organize an industrial and commercial youth service team to engage in the New Life Movement. The People's Education Center will invite scholars to give lectures on Esperanto on New Year's Day and prepare lantern riddles for decoration.</p>
<h3>Qingpu Bandit Song Maorong Executed</h3>
<p>The bandit Song Maorong, 22 years old, originally from Fengxian, who committed crimes in this county, was originally a doctor. In June of last year, he colluded with a large group of bandits, carrying guns, and successively kidnapped Ni Lansheng's child in Jinshanwei, looted the Ruanxiang Town in Fengxian and the firearms of the town's public security outpost, opened fire and killed people. In September of this year, he kidnapped Li Shenqi, Anzhuang Huang Shunfu, and others in Youbang, this county. He was escorted to the district headquarters by the First Detachment of the First District of the Provincial Public Security Water Police Team at the end of November and transferred to the county government for handling. The bandit Song Maorong confessed to all the kidnapping and looting cases. After the county government reviewed the files and presented them to the province for approval, he was sentenced to death. Qian, the County Magistrate, signed the order to extract the bandit the day before yesterday, verified his identity, and escorted him to Jinze Town for execution by shooting.</p>
<h3>Banditry Revives in the Fourth and Fifth Districts of Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Bandits have infiltrated the fourth and fifth districts of this county, and the people are in constant fear. In particular, in the Wangyingbei Township area, bandits are taking the opportunity to move around. Wu and others have been kidnapped by bandits in the township for large sums of money. The township urgently hopes that a team will be sent to suppress the bandits to avoid suffering from banditry again.</p>
<h3>Jiangqing Xiba Salt Merchants Petition</h3>
<p>Although the salt business in Xiba, Huaiyin, has declined in recent years, and many lake merchants have switched to trucking, there are still some merchants who still go to the dike to purchase salt and ship it out by boat. Because river-transported salt can be freely sold in Bengbu after arriving there, it is not restricted by the sequential sales of truck transport. Now, the Northern Transport Envoy Qiu Jieli has ordered the dike salt merchants to adopt the same method as truck transport. Therefore, the dike merchants are in great panic. On the 26th, the merchants of the transportation depot held a meeting to discuss ways to save the situation. Finally, they appointed representatives of the depot merchants Kan Lujian and representatives of the transportation merchants Yu Yansun and Wang Qingdong to go to Banpu Transportation Office to petition.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing Maoshengtong Pawnshop Reopens</h3>
<p>Jiaxing Fengjieqiao Town's Maoshengtong Pawnshop is owned by the town gentry Wu Huichen. Due to business losses, it announced the suspension of operations last month. The farmers near the area had no way to pawn their goods. The town's shops also suffered greatly from the sudden closure of the pawnshop, so they jointly sent a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce to forward to the County Government, urging the pawnshop to reopen immediately. The County Government also advised the pawnshop to find a way to reorganize and continue operating in order to benefit the poor. It is now known that the pawnshop has been officially transferred to Maoshengtong Qiaoji, and will continue operating from today (the 1st).</p>
<p>Special Announcement</p>
<h3>Review and Prospects of the Judiciary Over the Past Year</h3>
<p>Speaking of the state of the judiciary over the past year, I am truly very sorry. Although various matters concerning judicial organization mostly fall within the scope of judicial administration, which at the time was not under the jurisdiction of the Judicial Yuan, in essence, whether purely judicial or judicial administrative, many shortcomings have been left in our hearts during the past year, which is undeniable. The reasons for this are manifold, perhaps due to the country's many difficulties, or due to financial constraints, and also due to several struggles and efforts to reform, but with limited resources, it has not yet been possible to reach the realm of perfect ideals. However, summarizing these many setbacks and listing them as a review of the past and a lesson for the future is also a way for public servants to exercise self-discipline.</p>
<p>Currently, the judicial phenomena that make us feel most uneasy are roughly three points:</p>
<p>(1) The failure to abolish consular jurisdiction has resulted in the failure to achieve complete judicial sovereignty. This is the first shortcoming in the judiciary. Originally, on December 28, 1929, the National Government had already issued an order announcing the abolition of consular jurisdiction of various countries; on May 4, 1931, it further promulgated twelve articles of the "Regulations for the Implementation of Jurisdiction over Foreigners in China," stipulating that they would be implemented on January 1, 1932. At that time, it seemed that there was a desire to act vigorously, thereby breaking the shackles of unequal treaties and wiping out eighty years of shame. Subsequently, after the September 18th Incident, due to financial difficulties, all preparations for the abolition of consular jurisdiction were unable to be carried out and have been shelved to this day. This year, floods and droughts have occurred frequently, and the government has no time to rescue the dying and heal the wounded. Therefore, although the abolition of consular jurisdiction is highly anticipated, it has to be postponed until next year.</p>
<p>(2) The failure to universally establish new-style courts has resulted in the failure to thoroughly implement the spirit of judicial independence. This is the second shortcoming in the judiciary. According to the Six-Year Plan for Judicial Work during the Tutelage Period in 1929, it was originally planned to establish 1,367 county courts in the first two years, and then convert them into district courts in the third year. During the six years, 1,773 district courts, one high court, 42 high court branches, four supreme court branches, 47 juvenile detention centers, 174 ordinary prisons, 22 recidivist prisons, and 21 tuberculosis and mental illness prisons should be added. This is the plan of our party to complete judicial independence during the Tutelage Period. However, the current situation is also felt to be flawed, mostly because the country's finances are difficult, so many plans cannot be carried out on schedule. As of the end of 1934, there are currently 37 county courts (but established after 1929), 129 district courts (56 established after 1929), 24 high courts (2 established after 1929), 38 high court branches (9 added after 1929), one juvenile detention center, and 92 ordinary prisons (18 added after 1929), which is a huge difference compared to the original plan. However, this belongs to judicial administration, and before the change of affiliation in October, it was not the responsibility of the Judicial Yuan.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the effectiveness of the judiciary, although efforts have been made in recent years to achieve both "appropriateness" and "speed," there are still some regrets. The Supreme Court is under my direct command, and striving for "appropriateness" and "speed" is naturally my duty. According to statistics, the number of pending cases in the court was 5,518 in 1932, 5,191 in 1933, and 4,554 in 1934, showing a gradual decreasing trend year by year. Our ultimate goal is naturally to have "no backlog of cases," but with the current number of courtrooms and judges, I am afraid that we have exhausted our efforts and can no longer make further progress. In the past, the Supreme Court judges were limited to concluding 15 cases per month per person. Now, the minimum limit has been increased to 18 criminal cases and 20 civil cases per month. Considering the vastness of the case files in the third instance, concluding more than one case per day cannot be compared to those who are perfunctory and afraid of difficulty. As for the handling of cases in courts at all levels, it is difficult to calculate accurately because the statistics for this year have not yet been finalized. Here, we will take the Suzhou High Court, Jiangning District Court, Shanghai District Court, and Wuxian District Court as examples (because their locations are close to the capital and statistical materials are relatively easy to obtain). Table A below compares the number of criminal cases accepted by each court in the second instance with the number of cases in which the original judgment was overturned to see how much the degree of "appropriateness" has been achieved. Table B compares the rate of civil cases accepted by each court with the rate of pending cases to see the degree of "speed":</p>
<p>Table A (Criminal Second Instance)</p>
<p>Jiangsu High Court</p>
<p>Year　Number of Cases Accepted　Number of Original Judgments Overturned</p>
<p>1928　976　　　50</p>
<p>1929　1118　　　1060</p>
<p>1930　1483　　　720</p>
<p>1931　1711　　　723</p>
<p>1932　2577　　　1060</p>
<p>Jiangning District Court</p>
<p>Year　Number of Cases Accepted　Number of Original Judgments Overturned</p>
<p>1928　43　　　　5</p>
<p>1929　92　　　　5</p>
<p>1930　125　　　5</p>
<p>1931　158　　　4</p>
<p>1932　288　　　8</p>
<p>Shanghai District Court</p>
<p>Year　Number of Cases Accepted　Number of Original Judgments Overturned</p>
<p>1928　114　　　6</p>
<p>1929　163　　　8</p>
<p>1930　173　　　5</p>
<p>1931　178　　　5</p>
<p>1932　252　　　11</p>
<p>Wuxian District Court</p>
<p>Year　Number of Cases Accepted　Number of Original Judgments Overturned</p>
<p>1928　73　　　　3</p>
<p>1929　114　　　6</p>
<p>1930　173　　　7</p>
<p>1931　180　　　6</p>
<p>1932　215　　　7</p>
<p>Except for the Jiangning District Court, where the ratio between the two numbers has been slightly "three to one" over the years, the other courts have generally progressed from a "one to one" ratio to a "three to one" ratio, which shows that the handling of cases by courts at all levels has gradually improved in terms of "appropriateness." However, this difference is still very large and should be further improved unremittingly.</p>
<p>Table B (Civil Second Instance)</p>
<p>Number of Cases Accepted　Number of Pending Cases</p>
<p>Jiangsu High Court　1931　1315　252</p>
<p>1932　1727　380</p>
<p>1933　2163　363</p>
<p>Jiangning District Court　1931　280　　48</p>
<p>1932　371　　56</p>
<p>1933　463　　72</p>
<p>Shanghai District Court　1931　912　　131</p>
<p>1932　1144　146</p>
<p>1933　1290　138</p>
<p>Except for the Jiangning District Court, the number of cases accepted by the other two courts in 1933 increased compared to 1932, while the number of pending cases decreased, indicating that there has also been progress in the "speed" of handling cases. However, this only applies to a few major cities, and there are no statistics available for the rest. The fact that Jiangning District Court, located in the capital, lags behind is a major shortcoming.</p>
<p>From the above figures, it can be shown that the effectiveness of the judiciary has improved slightly over the past year, but it is still too far from our ultimate goal.</p>
<p>In addition, there is one more thing worth mentioning in the past year, which is the compilation of the Supreme Court's precedent abstracts. Because our country's laws are incomplete and there are often ambiguities in the provisions of the law, the compilation of precedents is particularly important for increasing judicial efficiency. This article contains 150,000 words, from the establishment of the Nanjing Supreme Court in 1927 to the end of December 1931, and all precedents that can clarify the purpose of the law have been collected as much as possible. In today's judicial situation with many holes and sores, this move is somewhat comforting.</p>
<p>The past situation has been roughly explained. Now, let's move on to expressing our hopes for the future.</p>
<p>The most urgent task is naturally to promptly implement the abolition of consular jurisdiction to realize the completeness of judicial sovereignty. On the one hand, this depends on improving the judiciary and completing various codes to block the excuses of foreigners as a basic step for proceeding, and when implementing it, diplomatic negotiations are also important. The completion of the code belongs to the scope of legislation, and the improvement of the judiciary is based on sufficient financial resources. Therefore, the abolition of consular jurisdiction must be achieved through the joint efforts of diplomacy, finance, judiciary, and legislation. There is no doubt that we must overcome all difficulties this year to reach this goal.</p>
<p>The second is to universally establish new-style courts to eliminate the old practice of combining administration and judiciary. It is planned to urge the Department of Judicial Administration to comprehensively plan and formulate detailed implementation methods in the shortest possible time and submit them to the central government for review and implementation, so that the six years of tutelage will not be in vain, and judicial independence will be gradually realized.</p>
<p>Thirdly, regarding the improvement of judicial efficiency, courts at all levels should also be urged to make the greatest efforts to achieve the extreme of "appropriateness" and "speed," aiming for the number of cases accepted by each court to be close to the number of cases decided, and for the number of pending cases to approach zero. In addition, the third instance should implement the legal review system. According to statistics, approximately 30% of the cases adjudicated by the Supreme Court are overturned. The goal for this year is to reduce this 30% to less than 10%. This will show that the lower courts are capable of handling cases "appropriately."</p>
<p>To achieve the above goals, there are roughly the following guidelines:</p>
<p>(A) Expand the courts and increase the number of courtrooms. Because the number of cases accepted by each court has been increasing in recent years, from the perspective of the entire government policy, various social policies should be adopted at the same time to enrich the national economy and fundamentally reduce the causes of crime and litigation. However, from the perspective of the judiciary itself, expanding the courts is an unavoidable measure to seek speed in handling cases.</p>
<p>(B) Strengthen the training of judges. Expanding the courts is to increase judicial efficiency from the quantitative aspect. At the same time, attention should also be paid to the qualitative aspect. The training of judges is to increase the ability of judges so that they can be sufficient to achieve the principle of "appropriateness" and "speed" in handling cases. The current judge training institute has also added a trial member training class and a clerk training class to assist in this. If the ability of judges is improved, the two meanings of "appropriateness" and "speed" in handling cases can be achieved.</p>
<p>(C) Establish a Legal Profession Research Association. The judge training institute can only gather a certain number of people in one place for a certain period of time to conduct research. The Legal Profession Research Association can allow judges from all over the country to continue their research. Its organization will generally be based on Supreme Court judges and prosecutors from the Procuratorate as basic members. Judges and prosecutors from high and district courts in various provinces can also join as members at any time to conduct joint research, so that judges in the national first, second, and third instances can exchange knowledge. The internal division is divided into civil and criminal groups, and members will raise questions on the articles and case interpretations of domestic and foreign laws, as well as existing cases in various provinces, and answer questions and argue with each other. In this way, those who are in the final trial position can be aware of the experiences of the first and second trials across the country. Those who are in the first and second trial positions can also recognize the original rules and measures of the final trial court. Internal and external communication, consistent spirit, not only can the cases sent back for retrial be gradually reduced, but also the talent and intelligence of judges across the country can be increased.</p>
<p>(D) Convene a National Judicial Conference. The methods of increasing judicial efficiency are naturally multifaceted. The thinking power of one person is limited, so it is necessary to gather legal practitioners and legal scholars from all over the country to conduct in-depth discussions to obtain detailed methods. Our plan is that if there are no other obstacles, this judicial conference will be realized this year.</p>
<p>The above is a small idea, and it is inevitable that there will be omissions. If all sectors are willing to give advice, I will naturally be happy to listen.</p>

<p>Message to the Citizens Mayor Wu Tiecheng's Message to the Citizens on New Year's Day of the 24th Year of the Republic of China states: The giant wheel of the times advances relentlessly along the historical trajectory of human groups. The curtain of the New Year of the 24th Year of the Republic of China is unfolding following the fleeting past year of 1934. Heaven acts vigorously, advancing without ceasing. On the occasion of the New Year, I feel even more inspired. I have been serving as the head of this city for three years. Following my duties and responsibilities, I am deeply concerned about the difficulties of the times. Therefore, I issue this message, hoping to encourage my fellow citizens together. The past three years have been a period of hardship and suffering for this city. Recalling the time when I received my appointment from the Party and the country, it coincided with the time when the Shanghai Incident was in full swing. I tried my best to respond to the difficult situation. At first, I worked hard to restore order and stabilize society, and then I diligently sought to provide disaster relief to the refugees and restore the war zone. Since the Municipal Government moved into its new building last year, it has followed the Premier's will and the plans of previous mayors to seek the gradual development of the city center and the gradual construction of various cultural undertakings. Although limited by time and financial resources, I dare not say that there have been special achievements, but I am deeply grateful for the assistance of wise people from all sides and the joint efforts of my colleagues in the Municipal Government. The image of recovery has gradually emerged, which is a source of comfort for us after the trauma. I quietly observe the current situation of this city. Since it has gradually recovered, we should continue to actively promote construction. The ancient governance of our country combined "education" and "nurturing." The way of construction puts the people's livelihood first. Considering the process of political evolution in various countries, it should be held as the standard for modern governance. Moreover, Shanghai, after its serious injuries, should recuperate and restore its inherent prosperity. At the same time, Shanghai is also the center of national culture, and we should strive to promote the popularization and improvement of education to establish the foundation for the revival and development of national culture. After extensive consideration of the historical principles of political evolution, the principle of "education" and "nurturing" are put forward to determine the direction of this year's governance, and I hope that the following matters will satisfy the urgent expectations of my fellow citizens. 1. Literacy Movement. The large number of illiterate people in our country is the greatest result of cultural decline and national weakness. According to the statistics of the French Confucian Cambo, the rise and fall of politics in various countries is closely related to the number of illiterate people. The municipal scholar Munro also believes that enlightened citizens are the driving force for municipal development. Although Shanghai has the advantage of being at the forefront of trends in various places, the proportion of illiterate people still accounts for the majority. In terms of school-age children, according to the latest statistics, they account for about 49.056%. In terms of adults, according to rough estimates, they also account for about 25%. Therefore, it is planned to use one year from this year to find ways to educate the illiterate people in this city between the ages of 15 and 30 as a basic movement for popularizing education, developing national power, and promoting municipal administration. 2. School Construction. There are many schools in this city, which can be said to be the best in the country. However, for thousands of years, due to the mistakes in the spirit of education and the lack of understanding of the connection between education and production, the more people who are educated, the fewer producers there are. The lack of life and the abundance of food have made the country poor and the people impoverished. The function of education lies first in increasing the knowledge and skills of human beings to cope with the environment and improve life. However, scholars in our country are not only not diligent in their four limbs, but also cannot distinguish the five grains. Therefore, as a result of promoting Confucian scholars for thousands of years, the national culture, whether spiritual or material, has not only made no significant progress, but has also declined day by day. It can be seen that education in our country has failed fundamentally and needs to be thoroughly transformed. Therefore, the future education policy of this city should aim at increasing the national production capacity. It is planned to open a vocational middle school within this year, and expand four agricultural schools, one in the Gaohang District, focusing on gardening experiments, two in the Luhang District, focusing on fruit tree experiments, three in the Zhenru District, focusing on rice cultivation experiments, and four in the Caojing District, focusing on animal husbandry experiments. Other aspects such as primary and secondary education are also the foundation for transforming education and training citizens. Therefore, it is planned to build two complete middle schools in the city center, and add facilities to the Xinlu Normal School, Yangjing Junior High School, and Wusong Junior High School. Model elementary schools will be built in the two districts of Hunan and Zhabei, and fifteen central elementary schools will be set up in various rural areas. 3. Social Construction. Residence is the primary requirement for people's lives, and it is also a serious problem in modern cities around the world, especially in this city. In recent years, the construction industry in this city has been progressing day by day, but with the decline of the national economy, the lives of ordinary people in this city have become increasingly difficult. Thatched houses are lined up, dwellings are simple, dirt and filth are hidden, epidemics are rampant, and the old and weak are in dire straits, which is a terrible sight. It not only damages the appearance of the city, but also hinders hygiene. It is necessary to actively provide relief. Therefore, it is planned to raise millions of dollars within this year to build six model new villages for civilians in the South City, Zhabei, Pudong, Huxi, and Hudong, totaling more than 3,000 rooms, in order to improve the lives of civilians in this city. Furthermore, civilian nurseries are also an important social construction in this city. The industry and commerce of this city are developing, and there are many factories. Civilians, whether men or women, are forced to make a living, so they often cannot take care of the comfort of infants. Therefore, it is planned to build a civilian nursery in the north and south of this city, so that the workers of the civilians can reduce the burden. Other matters such as the construction of public halls, the rectification of slaughterhouses, and the improvement of the lives of rickshaw pullers will also be actively planned according to the financial resources available. 4. Water Conservancy Construction - Water conservancy construction is the key to revitalizing the countryside today. The seawall project in this city has been neglected for many years, and the collapse is getting worse. Every autumn flood, the collapse is worrying. Although funds have been allocated and construction has been carried out over the years, due to the limitations of financial resources, it has been repaired and collapsed from time to time, and it is still a hidden danger. Thinking of this, I am deeply afraid, and it is urgent to coordinate large sums of money to seek a plan that will work once and for all. Even after the Shanghai Incident, when financial resources were scarce, we should also try to inject funds to achieve it. 5. Transportation Construction - Shanghai is the only commercial port in our country and a world-famous city. However, modern transportation facilities such as commercial flight ports are still lacking. The original Longhua Airport covers an area of only 280 acres, which is not enough for application. Therefore, special methods are used to open up and increase it to 970 acres, making it the first water and land flight port in our country. Longhua is located in the upper reaches of the Huangpu River, and the terrain and transportation are very convenient. The completion of this port will surely increase the prosperity of Shanghai. All of the above are only the main points. Politics does not lie in much talk, and I do not want to describe them one by one. Annual plans are in the spring, so I sincerely express my thoughts. Although there may be some delays due to financial constraints, this heart is always held in mind, and I will strive to realize them as scheduled. New Year's Day of the 24th Year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Hold Group Worship Mayor Wu Tiecheng, in addition to leading the Municipal Government's departments and bureaus, the Municipal Treasury, and the Municipal Chronicles Museum to hold meetings to celebrate, also held a group worship ceremony. It is stipulated that civilian officials participating in the ceremony should wear blue robes and black jackets, military officers above the rank of major in the Garrison Headquarters, security officers above the rank of lieutenant, and security team leaders and above should wear yellow wool uniforms, and officers above the rank of captain in the Municipal Public Security Bureau should wear black wool uniforms.</p>
<h3>Navy Celebrates</h3>
<p>January 1st is the anniversary of the founding of the National Government. The Training Fleet Headquarters of the Navy stationed in Shanghai issued a notice to the Hai Chou warship, Ziqiang warship, Zhongshan warship, Chuyou warship, and Haisong warship at Wusongkou stationed in Gaochang Temple in this city to raise flags to celebrate at 9:00 a.m. today.</p>
<p>Hold Group Worship The key staff of the training fleet headquarters, Jiangnan Shipyard, Naval Hospital, Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Plant, Naval Guard, and Naval Ordnance Department under the Navy Department stationed in Shanghai will hold a group worship at 9:00 a.m. today to express their celebration. In the afternoon, all organs will continue to work as usual and will not take a holiday.</p>
<h3>Workers' Union</h3>
<p>The Municipal General Labor Union, in order to celebrate the New Year's Day, originally planned to hold a workers' gathering at the new guild hall in Meijia Lane, Xiaonanmen at 10:00 a.m. today, and report on the industrial and commercial situation of this city in the past year to promote labor-management cooperation and seek industrial development. Since the renovation of the new guild hall has not been completed, the gathering has been changed to a dinner at the Tongxinglou Restaurant on Erma Road at 6:00 p.m. to promote fellowship. All labor unions have been notified to urge their members to participate enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Distribution of Gifts In order to increase the interest of the workers, the association has sent letters to various factories to solicit gifts. The current recipients include Huacheng Company, Family Industrial Cooperative, Liang Xinji, Tianchu Factory, Yonghe Industrial Cooperative, Wuzhou Pharmacy, Huafeng Factory, Samsung Factory, Yaguang Electric Wood Factory, Wuhe Cotton Weaving Factory, Huatong Factory, Meifeng Gold Casting Factory, Nanyang Tobacco Company, China Ping'an Pharmaceutical Salt Factory, Dachunghua Rubber Factory, Huasheng Factory, Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory, Sanyou Industrial Cooperative, etc., all of which sent exquisite products, a wide variety of which are breathtaking.</p>

<p>Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi met with He Qigong, Secretary of the National Economic Reconstruction Commission, Wen Yingxing, head of the Finance Ministry's Tax Police Corps, and Zhang Gongquan, General Manager of the Bank of China, at his residence at around 9:00 AM yesterday. According to Kong, who spoke to visiting reporters, regarding the unity of the country, the cooperation issue was a topic of discussion. He was unaware that there were currently no gaps between the central government and the southwest. Mr. Hu Zhantang also had the intention of coming north long ago and it could happen at any time. The outside world does not need to make his coming north an issue. As for his trip south, he had this intention last year and will eventually make the trip. This trip is not only to Hong Kong and Guangdong, but he also wants to go to Fujian and other provinces, and he will still have to go to Sichuan in the future, just to inspect the financial situation of those provinces. When he is in Hong Kong and Guangdong, he will certainly visit Mr. Hu Zhantang to have a heart-to-heart talk. The outside world does not need to pay too much attention.</p>

<p>Director of the Labor Relief Group of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee</p>
<p>Mr. Kong Xiangrong, after arriving in Nanjing from Bian some days ago, had official business and needed to report to Kong Xiangxi, Chairman of the committee. Therefore, he came to Shanghai from Nanjing the night before last. Because Kong was in Hangzhou, he stayed in Shanghai to wait. Kong returned to Shanghai the night before last, so Director Kong went to see him yesterday morning to report on the work relief group in detail and decided to go to Nanjing within days to supervise the project.</p>

<h3>Celebrating the Victory Over the Communists the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Published a Long Article Last Night</p>
<p>Historical Lessons of the Collapse of the Communists</p>
<p>In order to expand the celebration of the victory over the Communists, the Municipal Government has specifically scheduled a radio broadcast celebration rally at Zhongxi Electric on the 3rd of this month. In addition to speeches by Mayor Wu and Director Pan, people from the entertainment industry will also participate in the broadcast. Radio stations in this city will also broadcast celebration programs at the same time to celebrate. Mayor Wu published two articles last night titled "Historical Lessons of the Collapse of the Communists". They are transcribed below: 1. The way to save and revive the country today should first focus on both the root and the branch, and enrich the people's strength. 2. The rampant Communists are actually the extreme cause of the depletion of the people's strength and the decline of national power. 3. Revolutionary doctrines must have historical and ethnic characteristics and social realism. 4. Otherwise, it will inevitably be rejected by the social "love power" and eliminated by the national "vitality". In recent years, our country has been beset by worries. Externally, strong enemies are pressing on the border, shaking the foundation of the country. Internally, communist bandits are wreaking havoc, causing trouble in the heartland. Those who speak of national affairs either advocate resisting foreign aggression to secure the interior, or advocate securing the interior to resist foreign aggression. Those who advocate resisting foreign aggression believe that only by resisting foreign aggression can the spirit of the nation be revitalized and the turbulent public sentiment be stabilized. Without resisting foreign aggression, there is no way to secure the interior, and without resisting foreign aggression, there is no way to save the country. Those who advocate securing the interior say that only by securing the interior can the constraints of resisting the enemy be removed, the vitality of society be cultivated, and the strength of the country be enriched. Securing the interior is enough to resist foreign aggression, and securing the interior is the same as resisting foreign aggression. At this time, those who bear the heavy responsibility of the country cannot be afraid of difficulties and seek temporary peace, nor can they act rashly. They must not cater to the preferences of the times and bet the country's fate on a single throw. They should first calm their minds, endure their tempers, and deal with the situation calmly. They should look at both internal and external affairs, focus on both the root and the branch, establish a grand plan for saving the country and resisting foreign aggression, and clearly indicate the direction for the whole country to go. In the past, Sun Zhaoxian of the Song Dynasty said, "To resist foreign aggression, one must first govern the interior. To govern the interior, one must first appease the people. If one only knows about military needs and does not care about the suffering of the people, then resisting foreign aggression will not be effective, and internal worries will come first." Zeng Qing (Hu Wenzhonggong) also said, "To resist foreign aggression, one must first pacify the interior." The words of Sun and Zeng do not mean that foreign aggression should not be resisted, but that the way to resist foreign aggression must seek the basics. Things have a root and a branch, and affairs have a beginning and an end. Saving the country and resisting foreign aggression is a difficult and serious task. The modern military forces of various countries are based on the development level of their national science, culture, and all political, economic, educational, and social national power. China's deep weakness and the arrival of national disasters have complex and long-standing historical reasons. Therefore, today's way to save the country, to treat the root, is most important to enrich national power. To treat the branch, there is nothing more urgent than to clear the communist bandits. If national power is not strong, it is because the people's power is insufficient. The people's power is insufficient because of the immaturity of industry and the bankruptcy of the countryside. The rampant communist bandits are the extreme cause of the depletion of the people's power and the decline of national power. If they are not thoroughly eradicated, not only will the people not be able to live and work in peace, but all plans will be constrained by them, and even resisting foreign aggression and defending oneself will not be effectively implemented. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, worried about this, gathered the national army and devoted all efforts to suppress and clear out the red bandits who were consuming the people's power and causing trouble in the heartland, and to save the people who were in deep water and displaced, so as to enrich the people's power, develop national power, and prepare for resisting foreign aggression. All of this is to treat both the root and the branch, and to look at both internal and external affairs. It is not only an easy principle for saving the country and surviving today, but also the spirit that statesmen who endure humiliation, bear heavy burdens, and bury their heads in hard work should have. Today, the communist scourge that has rotted society and caused trouble in the heartland, and the bandit dens that have persecuted the nation for years, have finally been relied upon by the whole nation's cooperation and support, the hard work and sacrifice of the communist-suppression generals, and the hard work of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. The remnants of the bandits are fleeing like wolves and pigs, have lost their dependence, and are terrified and scattered. Their strength is weak and their power is scattered. It is easy to thoroughly eliminate them. Such objective and obvious constructions and reality, and what it shows to our people, is enough to prove that the national policies set by the central government in recent years are absolutely appropriate. This sign and this subtlety should not only be clearly understood by the Chinese people facing a crisis, but also be thoroughly believed by the whole country. Furthermore, a healthy country is based on healthy citizens, and healthy citizens are based on healthy thoughts. Healthy thoughts can nurture healthy vitality. With healthy vitality, one can determine the correct direction, promote the development of society, create a glorious and brilliant culture, and continue the long and great life of the nation. Therefore, revolutionary doctrines must have historical and national characteristics and social realism in order to conform to the objective needs and generate a common belief, thereby creating a great force for saving the world, rescuing the nation, and reviving the country. If one blindly follows doctrines that do not conform to the national conditions, picks up incomplete theories, and cuts one's feet to fit the shoes, one will eventually be rejected by the social "love power" and eliminated by the national "vitality". All of our people should deeply recognize this repeatedly proven historical lesson, and those who are still deluded should deeply regret the serious and difficult times today, turn back as soon as possible, and return to the Three Principles of the People that are suitable for the national conditions, unite as one, and jointly overcome the critical national crisis. The country is fortunate, and the nation is fortunate. (Shanghai, Lunar New Year's Eve, 23rd year of the Republic of China)</p>
<h3>Yu Xianglin Talks About Resolving the Postal Communication Issue</h3>
<p>Mail from Outside the Customs to Inside the Customs</p>
<p>Postal Stamps Are Divided into Four Types</p>
<p>After the northeastern four provinces were occupied by the Japanese army, the postal communication in that area was blockaded by our country. It has been two years and five months since its implementation in July 1932. Now, as a result of negotiations between the Chinese and Japanese authorities, the issue of postal communication in the Northeast has been resolved through negotiation without involving politics. Various postal items, except for parcels and remittances, will have the blockade lifted starting on January 10 and February 1, respectively. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency inquired with the postal authorities about the details yesterday. According to Zhu Menghou, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Postal Administration, the postal communication matter is still handled according to the method of traffic by private individuals to organize institutions to transport and deliver mail. Therefore, this bureau only received a notice and did not receive an order from the ministry. He also said that he could not disclose any details as he was not directly involved. The reporter then learned from the bureau that Yu Xianglin (former Director of the General Affairs Department of the General Administration), the postmaster of the Taiyuan Provincial Capital who had just arrived in Shanghai from Shanxi, was involved in the postal communication matter. He was found at the New Asia Restaurant and questioned about the details. According to him, the postal communication issue started negotiations shortly after the implementation of traffic. The Chinese side was represented by himself and Gao Zongwu, and the Japanese side was represented by the Kwantung Army, which sent Iga and Shibayama as responsible representatives. They discussed in Pingjin for three months, and recently decided to follow the traffic method by private individuals to organize postal agencies, one in Shanhaiguan and one in Gubeikou, to start delivering mail on January 10. Mail from inside the customs to outside the customs will still use the current postal stamps. Postal stamps from outside the customs to inside the customs will be printed with special postal stamps. The types of postal stamps will be based on the old stamps before September 18, divided into two-cent, four-cent, eight-cent, and twelve-cent denominations. The colors are divided into two types. The two-cent and four-cent stamps will have two ears of wheat drawn in a cross shape. The eight-cent and twelve-cent stamps will have landscapes drawn on them. The words used will only be "Postal Administration", and the words "China" and "Japanese Puppet" will not be added. The expenses of the two institutions will be covered by private individuals in advance as start-up expenses. Thereafter, 1% will be deducted from postal remittances to cover the regular expenses. It is investigated that our country has implemented a postal blockade since July 1932, which has now been two and a half years. Now, forced by the situation and due to the inconvenience of communication for the people, we are seeking a mending remedy, etc. Mr. Yu is still staying in Shanghai for a week and will then go north, first to Peiping, and then return to his original post in Taiyuan once the postal communication is implemented. According to another source, the reporter was told that there were seven decisions made regarding the Kwantung postal communication. As for telegrams, which have the same nature as postal letters, the reporter inquired with the telegraph bureau, which said that at present, the telecommunications in the eastern provinces are relayed through Yantai and Dalian. Telegrams have a fixed line, and the actual reporting is still the same as before. There is no news of any new developments.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Grain Merchants' Cash Purchase Detained by Tongshan County</h3>
<p>Shanghai Has Sent a Telegram Asking for Release</p>
<p>The Central Government has long had a clear order prohibiting the carrying of cash out of the country. If anyone is found to have exceeded the limited amount, it will be confiscated. A certain grain store in this port sent personnel to the Xuhai area to purchase miscellaneous grains. Because they carried a large amount of cash, they were discovered by the local government and deemed to have violated the ban. The cash was confiscated and the people were detained. Shanghai has received the news and has sent a telegram to rescue them. The details are described as follows.</p>
<h3>Huge Sum Taken to Xuhai</h3>
<p>A certain grain merchant in this port needed to purchase miscellaneous grains, so they prepared cash of several tens of thousands of yuan, packed in three boxes, and entrusted two staff members, Mr. Lu and Mr. Wang, to carry this amount and personally go to the various ports of Xuhai to directly purchase miscellaneous grains and soybeans for sale in Shanghai. Because the local villagers did not like banknotes, they carried cash. Unexpectedly, this matter happened in Tongshan County.</p>
<h3>County Government Detains Cash and People</h3>
<p>The county police stated that the limit for carrying cash was 50 yuan per person. Now, these two people were carrying such a large amount of cash, which not only violated the government ban but also had suspicion of smuggling. Therefore, the cash was detained, and Mr. Lu and Mr. Wang were sent to the county government for investigation. Although the two repeatedly stated that they were purchasing miscellaneous grains and were not smuggling, it was to no avail.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Receives Telegram</h3>
<p>After this matter occurred, Mr. Lu and Mr. Wang requested Tongshan County to allow them to send a telegram to Shanghai to report the matter and to ask Shanghai to send a telegram to prove the facts for their early release. Yesterday, the grain store received a telegram from Xuzhou. Because the matter was of great importance, they immediately reported it to the Municipal Miscellaneous Grain Association, requesting the association to find a way to send a telegram to Tongshan County requesting the release of Mr. Lu and Mr. Wang and the return of the original cash.</p>
<h3>Various Parties Send Telegrams of Proof</h3>
<p>The grain store originally planned to transport the purchased miscellaneous grains to Shanghai via the Longhai Railway and entrust the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to load them. Therefore, the Miscellaneous Grain Association has requested Liu Hongsheng, General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, to send a telegram to Qian Zongze, Director of the Longhai Railway Bureau, to quickly issue a proof and inform Tongshan County to release Mr. Lu and Mr. Wang and return the cash as soon as possible. Liu Hongsheng has complied with the association's request and sent a telegram to Director Qian. Yesterday afternoon, Director Qian had a reply telegram to Shanghai, saying that he had forwarded the original telegram to the Tongshan County Government for investigation.</p>
<h3>Private Postal Bureaus File Administrative Appeal</h3>
<p>Ministry of Communications' Reply States That the Request is Difficult to Approve</p>
<p>Private Bureaus Present Reasons for Requesting Separate Disposal</p>
<p>According to the East China News Agency, the Ministry of Communications has ordered all private postal bureaus in the country to close down by the end of the 23rd year of the Republic of China. The deadline has now arrived. The private postal bureaus, because more than 100,000 employees will have difficulty making a living after the closure, have requested a five-year extension. The Ministry of Communications, because the matter belongs to the unified postal system, has replied that it cannot be approved. The day before yesterday, the private postal bureaus submitted three reasons to the Ministry of Communications to file an administrative appeal. It seems that the disturbance will continue to expand. The Ministry's reply and the original text of the private bureaus' appeal are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications' Reply</h3>
<p>The submission has been noted. It is investigated that the banning of private postal bureaus is a necessary move to unify the postal system. The postal system is a state-operated business, which is a common practice in all countries around the world. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, the National Communications Conference resolved that all private postal bureaus should be banned by the 19th year of the Republic of China. It should have been implemented on schedule. Later, because the postal industry repeatedly requested, five temporary registration and licensing measures for private postal bureaus were formulated, allowing them to continue operating temporarily. This temporary measure was originally to give the postal industry workers and others the opportunity to gradually change their livelihood and has been extended on record. The period given has been several years and cannot be said to be ungenerous. Even this time, the order issued by this Ministry limiting the gradual cessation of operations of private postal bureaus to the end of the 23rd year of the Republic of China was issued on November 23 of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, with a period of more than a year. The postal industry can abide by the Ministry's order, gradually close down, and seek another livelihood, which is also more than enough. But they did not do this, and they are only harming themselves. Now that this bureau has clearly defined the deadline for cessation and the Executive Yuan has repeatedly issued orders, the requested extension and the prior cessation are difficult to approve. The representatives are to convey this to the fellow industry members to comply with the order and close down, so as to uphold the rule of law. This is the reply.</p>
<h3>Civil Affairs Bureau Appeal</h3>
<p>Regarding the appeal against the punishment imposed by the Ministry's No. 4059 decree, according to the law, the appellants, because the private postal bureaus were closing down and the deadline was imminent, requested an extension and suspension of execution, hoping for consideration. On the 24th of this month, the Ministry's No. 4059 decree was received, stating (the decree is omitted as it appeared previously), and so on. The legal principles were not examined, nor was the benefit considered, making it difficult to accept. Therefore, an appeal is filed within the legal deadline. The reasons are listed below. It is noted that the postal service should be exclusively operated by the state, as clearly stipulated in Article 1 of the Postal Law. However, Article 2 clarifies the scope as the collection, sending, and delivery of letters and postcards, while remittances, parcels, and savings can be operated concurrently by the post office, indicating that it is not a postal monopoly. Our private postal bureaus have a long history. In the past, before our country had a postal service, letters, money, and parcels were all delivered through them. After the establishment of the postal service, people in cities with post offices have abandoned these for the postal service regarding letter delivery. Their business is practically limited to money and parcels, merely eking out a living based on past reputation. Furthermore, even in recent years, the collection and sending of letters have been subject to the five restrictions of the "Temporary Measures for Private Postal Bureaus to Register and Obtain Licenses," and they are all sealed into general packages and delivered by the post office. The rise and fall of their business can be easily determined upon verification. Therefore, their existence does not harm the progress of the postal service. On the contrary, banning them would deprive most rural people of their convenience. Even if the Ministry is determined to unify the postal service and believes that private postal bureaus should absolutely not collect and deliver letters, restrictions can be imposed on this letter business. Alternatively, the "Temporary Measures for Private Postal Bureaus to Register and Obtain Licenses" can be abolished, so that private postal bureaus no longer collect and send letters (or postcards), which would be sufficient. It is not appropriate to issue an order to shut down businesses and enforce it, nor to disregard the interests of most rural people nationwide in sending silver and parcel objects when the appellants request an extension of the closure and suspension of execution. The reply states, "The request for an extension and prior suspension of execution is difficult to approve," and so on, implying an imminent and compulsory execution, which has no legal basis, restricts the people's freedom of business, and violates Article 317 of the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China. This is the first illegality of the original decree's disposition. Secondly, from a factual point of view, even if the past contributions of private postal bureaus to the country and society are not considered, the interests of the majority of people in remote rural areas should be considered. People in these areas find it inconvenient to send and deliver letters because post office mailboxes are not yet widely available, and remitting silver and parcels, especially to post offices far from the city, involves complicated procedures, guarantees, and seals, which ignorant villagers find even more difficult. At a time when education is not yet universal and the postal service is not yet perfect, the social needs for private postal bureaus should be taken into account, their existence encouraged, and their improvement urged. Moreover, the premise of national governance is the welfare of society and the majority of the people. All undertakings beneficial to the masses, whether public or private, should be maintained, as is the case in all countries of the world. Now, only paying attention to superficiality, knowing only that the postal service in all countries of the world is a state monopoly, and following suit, without observing the actual situation in the country, orders and decrees are hastily issued to close down businesses within a time limit, and furthermore, compulsory execution is carried out, which is clearly inappropriate in terms of governance principles. This is the second inappropriateness of the original decree's disposition. Furthermore, the private postal bureaus employ more than 100,000 people, scattered across provinces, doing business thousands of miles away, originally relying on salaries for their livelihoods. In recent years, their business has become a spent force, and at a time when the rural economy nationwide is bankrupt, disasters and famines occur frequently in various provinces, industry and commerce are declining, and all industries are withering. It is true, as the original decree states, that "the order has been issued for more than a year, and there is ample time to seek another livelihood." However, it is not known that under today's social circumstances, even if one wants to change careers, there is nothing to do. Once the order to close down businesses is enforced, these more than 100,000 employees and hundreds of thousands of family members will inevitably become starving corpses. If some are strong and resort to violence, social security will also be affected. Therefore, private postal bureaus have even more need for an extension of closure and suspension of execution. Even if the order to close down businesses is to be enforced, the government should find ways to provide relief and properly arrange measures to alleviate suffering and maintain security. However, after the appellants' request, no consideration was given to it. This is the third inappropriateness of the original decree's disposition. In summary, it is requested that the Ministry revoke the No. 4059 decree issued in December of the 23rd year (1934) and make another appropriate disposition to comply with the law and stabilize society. It would be most virtuous and convenient. Respectfully submitted to Zhu, Minister of Transportation, by the representatives of the national private postal bureaus: Hua Yunjin, Yin Yuantong, Wang Dashi, Zhuang Gengtang, Qiu Zhensheng, Ren Shiting, Pan Wentian, Guarantor: Yu Qiaqing.</p>
<h3>School Universal Donations Have Exceeded 10,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Wealthy People Donating Enthusiastically</p>
<p>The Emergency Relief Universal Donation Committee has been reporting the details of the various universal donations received in recent days. Yesterday, various schools continued to submit their donations to the committee, including Fushan Free Primary School with 204 cents in small silver coins, Jiangzhen Primary School with three yuan in large silver coins and 52 cents in small silver coins, and Lingnan Private Primary School with 25 yuan in large silver coins. Eighty schools from Ningbo in Shanghai donated 24 yuan in large silver coins. More than 400 schools, including large, medium, and small schools, have completed their universal donations, totaling approximately 13,000 yuan in donations. However, more than 100 schools have not yet received receipts from the Emergency Relief Universal Donation Committee, which has sent letters urging them to do so, and the Municipal Education Bureau has also strictly ordered them to receive them.</p>
<p>The Emergency Relief Universal Donation Committee has received a considerable amount of donations from wealthy people in recent days. Yesterday, Mr. Huang Jingquan also submitted his donation to the committee according to the amount he pledged.</p>
<p>The General Affairs Department of the Emergency Relief Universal Donation Committee has been working day and night for a month since its establishment, without rest, even on Sundays. Due to the New Year's Day holiday, there will be a two-day break, and business will resume as usual on the third day.</p>
<p>Regarding the workers' universal donations, it is reported that the Shanghai Bank received 14 yuan and 54 cents in large silver coins from the China Development Steel and Stationery Factory yesterday. Furthermore, the Emergency Relief Universal Donation Committee has specially entrusted various newspaper offices, banks, shops, etc. to collect donations on its behalf for the convenience of people from all walks of life to contribute to the universal donation. It is reported that Lao Jiulun Silk and Satin Bureau submitted 50 yuan in large silver coins to the committee yesterday.</p>
<h3>Dong Xianguang Resigns from Continental Daily</h3>
<p>Recuperating Due to Unrecovered Health</p>
<p>After Mr. Dong Xianguang resigned from his position as general manager of the Continental Daily in September of last year, he only held the position of chief writer of the newspaper. Last autumn, Mr. Dong was in the hospital for several months, and his mental and physical strength has not fully recovered. Therefore, he decided to get rid of the hard and heavy responsibility of a journalist and recuperate. Yesterday, he resigned from the position of chief writer of the newspaper as well. Mr. Dong has served the Continental Daily since 1930 for five years, which has been quite laborious. The board of directors of the newspaper firmly tried to retain him but failed, expressing deep regret.</p>
<h3>New Contributions to the Shenbao Monthly</h3>
<p>Since its inception, the Shenbao Monthly has been running for more than three years. Its content is excellent, and the layout is very novel, which is highly praised by all sectors of society. Therefore, the sales volume is increasing day by day. This year, a reform plan has been formulated to make it even better. The New Year's issue of the journal specially adds two major special features. The first is "Sketches of World Political Trends," which provides a detailed analysis of the recent trends in world politics, allowing readers to grasp the overall world situation with this one volume.

<h3>Lin Xiaomei's Extortion Arrested</h3>
<p>Yan Erer First Imprisoned</p>
<p>The Police Station Indeed Captured the Villain</p>
<p>Yan Erer (also known as Zhang Erer), the foreman of the Guanghua Woolen Mill on Luban Road, has made a considerable profit, which has been coveted by general bandits. Recently, Yan Erer has repeatedly received multiple threatening letters from the post office, signed by the "Chinese Hero Party," demanding 3,000 yuan. Yan ignored them. Last month, Yan was shot at on the road, and he was injured in the chest. The gunman escaped without a trace. Yan immediately admitted himself to Baolong Hospital for treatment, and it took about a month for him to recover and be discharged from the hospital. Unexpectedly, he recently received several guarantee letters from the bandit party, with unusually fierce wording, and designated the location for payment at the intersection of Dongchang Road and Xinma Road in Pudong. The person in contact had to wear a white cloth on their head and hold a newspaper. Yan immediately reported the information to the Pudong Police Station, which secretly dispatched squad leader Li Xiaobao and detectives to go to the address without making a sound. The detectives pretended to be the person in contact. When they arrived at the destination, the bandit Lin Xiaomei (from Taizhou) came forward to make contact. Squad leader Li immediately rushed forward and captured him. He was immediately taken to the station for interrogation and then transferred to the local court for questioning. Yesterday, Prosecutor Li Fen ordered Li Xiaobao to be summoned to court for questioning.</p>

<h3>American Cantonese Man Arrested for Bringing a Woman from the United States to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Due to Being Sued in the United States</p>
<p>The Great American Evening News reports that an American Cantonese man, Rin Lem, was recently accused by the Southern California District Court of the United States for bringing a young girl to the United States with the intention of selling her into prostitution and other immoral acts. This morning (31st), when the Cantonese man and the woman arrived in Shanghai from the United States on the Dollar Line Company mail ship, President Harrison, an executive officer of the U.S. Consulate General arrested them at the pier. Both were sitting in first class. According to the Cantonese man, the woman traveling with him is his biological daughter and is also an American citizen. U.S. Consul General Hillmeck has ordered the Cantonese man to post a bail of US$2,500. The woman was not detained because her nationality was unclear. According to a recent report from the Associated Press in Los Angeles, the Cantonese man sold a young girl to a businessman in Los Angeles for US$1,800, and the payment has been made. The girl is about 20 years old, with a beautiful face, and was weeping sadly at the time. She was then separated from her occasional "husband" and demanded a separate living allowance of US$100 from the businessman in the Los Angeles court. Before the case was decided, the woman suddenly disappeared. The businessman then asked the court to investigate. It was then confirmed by the immigration authorities that the woman and the Cantonese man who sold her had taken the President Harrison to Shanghai. The U.S. judicial authorities in Shanghai were immediately notified by telegram to detain him first. The formal evidence needed for his return to the United States for handling will be sent to Shanghai for verification. It is reported that these documents are already on their way. If the Cantonese man cannot pay the full bail, he will be temporarily detained in the Xiamen Road West Prison to await the arrival of the documents. The woman traveling with him was not detained because the U.S. authorities did not prosecute her. Even if she is prosecuted, she cannot be extradited back to the United States unless it is confirmed that she is indeed an American citizen, because there is no extradition treaty between China and the United States.</p>
<h3>Qingpu Fengjing Bandit Leader Fang Ziyao Transferred</h3>
<p>Trying to Downplay the Case by Claiming Robberies in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Police Station's Investigation Found No Such Case</p>
<p>Fang Ziyao, from Fengjing, Songjiang, is a bandit leader with many followers. He has repeatedly committed kidnapping and extortion cases in the Qingpu Fengjing area. After the case was exposed, he fled to Shanghai. He was recently arrested by Jiang Deyu and other detectives from the Jiangsu Water Police Provincial Public Security Team at the intersection of North Fujian Road and North Suzhou Road. He was taken to the Huishi Police Station, and then transferred to the First Special Court. During the interrogation, it was learned that Fang had committed theft in the concession, so an order was issued to detain him for investigation, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Tingqi continued the trial in the Eighth Criminal Court. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated that the reason for the previous postponement was that Fang confessed to robbing a certain cigarette paper shop near the intersection of Beijing Road and Zhejiang Road in the police station. The police station ordered detectives to investigate the cigarette paper shops in the vicinity, but no robberies had occurred. Later, Fang confessed that he had robbed a cigarette paper shop on Xiamen Road about three months ago. Investigators also went to investigate. Although a cigarette paper shop had been robbed, it was in June of this year, and more than 100 double-corner coins were robbed. Therefore, Fang's confession is unreliable and he seems to be trying to downplay the case and serve a minor sentence in the concession prison to avoid extradition. The police station does not object to the transfer. Subsequently, Jiang Deyu, a detective from the First District of the Water Police, submitted an official document requesting a transfer. Judge Wu then ordered that Fang Ziyao be handed over to Detective Jiang Deyu for trial.</p>
<h3>Fire on Lafayette Road Burns Girl to Death</h3>

During the fire, a girl named Wu Yuexiang, who was only four years old, was unable to escape and perished in the fire, which was a tragic sight to behold. The fire department dispatched vehicles to put out the fire, and it was finally extinguished at 3:30 p.m. A total of two houses were destroyed.</p>
<h3>Manager Loses a Fur Coat from the Shop and It Leads to a Death</h3>
<p>Threatened with Investigation, He Couldn't Bear It and Committed Suicide Due to Fear of Humiliation</p>
<p>Zhai Alin, a 27-year-old native of Jiading, was a shop clerk at the Jutai Bingji Tobacco Shop at No. 10 Tong'an Lane, Old Yong'an Street, French Concession, earning eight yuan a month. He had been employed for two or three years. Recently, a fur coat belonging to the manager of the shop, Chen Fucai (a 22-year-old Ningbo native), was placed in a trunk in the reception room. The coat, worth about 30 or 40 yuan, was newly made last year. It suddenly went missing sometime between the 23rd and 25th of last month. Only this one fur coat had disappeared without a trace. He suspected that two old clerks and an apprentice in the shop had stolen it, and declared that he would investigate and recover it, but he had not yet done so. Unexpectedly, Zhai Alin learned that the manager's fur coat had been lost and that he was going to investigate them. Although he had not committed the theft, his conscience was clear. However, he thought that if he was questioned in person, he would be humiliated. In a moment of panic, he suddenly had suicidal thoughts. On the evening of the 27th, he left the shop and bought raw opium. He checked into Room 7 of the Fuxing Hotel at No. 325 Avenue Edward VII. That night, he swallowed the raw opium and committed suicide. The next morning, the poison took effect. The tea boy, Xia Abing (a 24-year-old native of Suzhou), discovered it and reported it to the French police, who sent detectives to investigate. They rushed Zhai to Renji Hospital, where he vomited the poison after treatment. He regained consciousness and could speak. His cousin, Zhai Axing (a 30-year-old senior clerk at the Hengchun Tobacco Shop at No. 2 Fengyu Lane, North Station Boundary Road), received the news and went to the hospital to visit him. Alin told his cousin the details of the suicide. He wanted to wait until he recovered and was discharged from the hospital before dealing with it. Unexpectedly, Alin's internal organs were still poisoned by the opium, and it suddenly recurred. The rescue was ineffective, and he died in the hospital at 6:25 p.m. on the 30th. The hospital notified the police, who sent a detective to the Jutai Tobacco Shop to investigate the cause of the suicide. His body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch to be examined. Yesterday, the police reported to the Second Special Court Procuratorate and appointed Wang Ren to accompany forensic doctor Jiang and clerk Zhao to the morgue at noon to examine the body. They began the official investigation after confirming the body. The detectives first reported the case, and then Zhai Axing, a relative of the deceased, claimed that his cousin Alin had died a wrongful death and requested justice. The deceased had parents, wife, and children at home, and he had sent a letter to notify them that they could arrive today to collect the body. The officials questioned the witnesses Chen Fucai and Xia Abing about the investigation of the lost fur coat and the discovery of the deceased's suicide. The officials then ruled that Zhai Alin had died of opium poisoning and that the family members could claim the body after signing a guarantee.</p>

<h3>Suspect Arrested in Shanghai in the Murder Case of Mr. Shi Liangcai</h3>
<p>He is Zhang Wentian, a watchman from Yongyuan Lane on Tianjin Road.</p>
<p>Police Investigation Says the Watchman Never Left Shanghai</p>
<p>After the murder of our newspaper's General Manager, Mr. Shi Liangcai, the Zhejiang provincial military and police authorities immediately launched a strict search for the perpetrators. Although several suspects have been arrested, the true culprit has not yet been apprehended. Recently, the Hangzhou County Local Court Prosecutor's Office sent a document to the Shanghai First Special District Local Court stating that Zhang Wentian, also known as A'er, a native of Nantong, who serves as a watchman in Yongyuan Lane on Tianjin Road in Shanghai, is highly suspected of involvement in the Shi case and should be apprehended by warrant. The First Special Court issued warrant No. 5344 and sent it to the General Inspectorate of Police for execution. Consequently, Chief Constable Zhang Xiaolin was ordered to proceed to the address on the morning of the 29th of this month at 11:00 AM and arrest Zhang. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Division of the First Special Court, where Criminal Judge Qian Hongye presided over the interrogation. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, explained the background of the case, stating that according to police investigation, Zhang Wentian has been working in Shanghai for over twenty years and has never left the city. He requested the court to verify this information. When questioned, Zhang Wentian denied the facts and hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to defend him, requesting that the Hangzhou County Court Prosecutor's Office be asked to send the confession in which the defendant was named to the court for rebuttal. He argued that since Zhang Wentian has been in Shanghai for over twenty years and has never left, how could he have committed the crime in Hangzhou? He asked the court to take this into consideration.</p>
<p>The court then ordered that the case be adjourned to January 8th for further hearing, pending notification to the Hangzhou County Court Prosecutor's Office to send personnel to escort him.</p>

<p>Li Songlin, No. 813, (29 years old, from Songjiang, originally a cotton merchant, sentenced to five years imprisonment by the former French Concession court for theft, to be handed over to the mainland authorities for investigation upon completion of the term, having served four years and ten months to date) Liu Fugui, No. 984, (24 years old, from Shandong, originally worked for the Public Works Bureau, colluded with others in March this year to fight in front of the Minle Theatre on Rue Pére Robert, causing the death of Xu Zhou, a martial arts teacher from Xuzhou, sentenced to two years and six months imprisonment after arrest) Zhang Gengsheng, No. 604, (28 years old, from Changzhou, originally a tobacco and paper shop owner, sentenced to one year imprisonment for theft, having served eleven months to date) Gao A'tu, No. 231, (31 years old, from Ningbo, originally a sailor on a ship, sentenced to two years imprisonment for a red pill case) Fan Guonan, No. 90, (29 years old, from Hunan, originally a fruit seller, sentenced to one year and four months imprisonment for theft) Cai Weicai, No. 634, (38 years old, from Nanhui, originally a tailor, arrested in the 18th year of the Republic for the kidnapping of Wei Tingrong, sentenced to twenty years imprisonment, having served approximately three years to date) Ji Fa, No. 417, (28 years old, from Shaoxing, originally a hotel owner, sentenced to four months imprisonment for theft, having completed the term on the 29th of last month) and seven other inmates, except for Gao A'tu, who is currently assigned to</p>
<h3>Cleaning</h3>
<p>miscellaneous duties, and Zhang Gengsheng, who is assigned to cooking and delivering inmates' meals in tin cans, the rest are assigned to work in the cardboard box and paper bag factory. Li Songlin also serves as the person in charge of receiving and dispatching materials in the factory. Recently, Mo Guangjin, a 28-year-old from Guangdong, was arrested for a tobacco case and sentenced to six months imprisonment. He appealed the sentence and was detained in the detention center for three months. On the 28th of last month, the sentence was confirmed, and the execution court transferred Mo to the Second Special Prison for execution, assigned number 958 and confined him in cell 57, and also assigned him to work outside in the cardboard box and paper bag factory. However, Li Songlin and Cai Weicai, who work in the same factory, were working inside and ordered Ji Fa, an inmate who was about to be released, to bring Mo Guang from the outside to the inside. Li and Cai then threatened Mo, demanding five yuan for treats. Because Mo had no money,</p>
<h3>During the Shift Change</h3>
<p>Li and Cai took the opportunity to go outside to keep watch, while ordering Liu Fugui, Fan Guonan, and Ji Fa, inmates working in the same area, and Gao A'tu and Zhang Gengsheng, inmates on duty outside, to carry out the attack. First, they tied Mo's eyes with a towel so that he could not see their faces clearly, and then used a bench to beat Mo's chest and back, causing injuries and causing him to fall to the ground, unable to get up. The on-duty guard noticed and stopped them. He immediately reported the incident to the superiors, who immediately arrested all the inmates involved in the attack and shackled them with more than ten pounds of heavy shackles (Ji Fa, the offender, was not shackled). They immediately summoned a doctor to examine Mo's injuries and provide treatment, and after interrogation, reported the matter to the French Police, who immediately dispatched Inspector Jin Jiulin of the Special Agency, along with detectives Jiang Changwen, Dai Rongji, and Wu Wengang, to the prison to take Li, Liu, Zhang, Gao, Fan, Cai, and Ji, a total of seven inmates, along with the victim Mo Guang and the murder weapon bench, to the police station for investigation. Yesterday, they were escorted to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, where Judge Zhang Chaozuo presided over the interrogation. The inmates, due to</p>
<h3>Heavy Shackles</h3>
<p>walked slowly and could not stand upon arrival, all lying prostrate on the ground. The victim was temporarily brought from the police station by detectives. The judge first asked the inmates their age, origin, occupation, and the crimes and sentences they were convicted of. Then, the police lawyer Gu Shouchi stated the case, briefly stating that the defendants in this case were extorting money and committing assault and battery in prison. The police department is currently investigating. Recently, a new inmate was sent to prison, and the defendants threatened him, demanding that he treat them, extorting five yuan without success. The defendants took advantage of the guard's shift change to carry out the attack, beating the plaintiff and causing injuries. He requested a postponement of the hearing until a detailed investigation is completed. He requested that the defendants be temporarily detained. Then, the victim Mo Guang stated, "I was sentenced to six months imprisonment for a tobacco case and was sent to prison on the 28th of the month, and was assigned to work in the factory. First, No. 417 (referring to Ji Fa) called me in. The defendants asked me if I had been here before and whether I understood the rules here. I replied that I did not know. They then said that they wanted me to pay five yuan for treats. I replied that my family was not in Shanghai and I had no money. They immediately used a towel from behind me and tied my eyes and then started beating me. Now</p>
<h3>Chest and Back Injuries</h3>
<p>I have not slept for two nights. I do not know the names of the defendants because it was my first day." The judge then ordered the bailiff to take Mo to the forensic doctor for examination, and then ordered the defendants to be taken to the adjacent room for interrogation. He first questioned Ji Fa, who confessed, "I did not ask Mo for money. Moreover, my sentence expires on the 29th, and I will be released soon. Why would I ask for money? At that time, someone inside called for No. 958 (referring to the victim Mo Guang), but he did not answer. I then called him to go into the inner factory. They fought for money, I do not know." The judge questioned him, "Are you not an accomplice in the attack? Can you point out each person?" He replied, "Because they were all next to me, I reported the facts truthfully." The judge ordered that the defendants be brought to the court again for questioning one by one.</p>
<h3>Denied Any Involvement</h3>
<p>extortion, assault and battery, all</p>
<p>claiming ignorance. Especially Li Songlin and Cai Weicai, who have been in prison for a long time and are experienced, although sitting prostrate on the ground in court, they were calm and eloquent in their statements, addressing the judge as "Great Lord" without any sign of fear. The situation was quite comical. After the interrogation, the court ordered a postponement of the hearing to January 10, and the defendants were returned to custody. At this time, Li and Cai again requested the court to detain the guards and transfer them to the prosecutor's office for investigation. The judge said that the police department is currently investigating and has not yet filed a public prosecution, so they could not be transferred to the detention center. The two defendants said in unison, "We cannot bear the hardship of going to the police station. Please forgive us." They insisted on sitting on the ground and refused to get up. The bailiffs helped them up and sent them back to the police station for detention.</p>

<h3>Children's Year Ceremony Pending</h3>
<p>Other Matters Proceed According to the Original Plan</p>
<p>The 24th year of the Republic of China has long been designated as Children's Year by the government. Today is the first day of the 24th year of the Republic of China. The China Child Welfare Association and the Shanghai Children's Welfare Committee originally agreed to hold the opening ceremony of Children's Year and consulted with major daily newspapers to publish special issues on Children's Year to express their enthusiasm for celebration. However, it has been learned by reporters that this matter has encountered difficulties. Although the establishment of Children's Year has been approved by the government, the implementation steps have not yet been officially promulgated nationwide by the government, and the Children's Year Preparatory Committee is</p>
<p>still being organized by the Ministry of Education. Therefore, Shanghai City will not be able to hold the opening ceremony of Children's Year today, and major daily newspapers have also postponed the publication of special issues on Children's Year. Yesterday afternoon, reporters specifically visited the China Child Welfare Association, where Mr. Chen Zhengfan, a member of the Education Group of the association, received them and explained the details of the matter. According to Mr. Chen, the Child Welfare Association received a reply from the Ministry of Education a few days ago, stating that the organizational outline of the Children's Year Preparatory Committee has been approved by the ministry and is in active progress. As Children's Year is a matter of national concern, the government will definitely promulgate it nationwide to ensure that all regions proceed in an orderly and unified manner. Since Shanghai City held an opening ceremony for Children's Year in Shanghai once on New Year's Day in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, it is not appropriate to hold it again separately at this time when the government has not yet issued an order for all regions to hold it. As for the editing of the special issue on Children's Year, the Education Group of the association is still responsible for it. Recently, the association has received inscriptions and articles from President Lin of the National Government, Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan, President Sun of the Legislative Yuan, President Dai of the Examination Yuan, President Yu of the Control Yuan, Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education, Minister Huang of the Ministry of Interior, Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, Mayor Wu of Shanghai, Cai Yuanpei, Xiong Xiling, Wang Zhengting Zhang Zhijiang, Luo Jialun, and Pan Gongzhan, all of which are exquisitely written and beautiful. Once the government issues an order for all regions to hold Children's Year on a scheduled date, it will be disclosed in Shanghai newspapers. Furthermore, although the opening ceremony of Children's Year will not be held today, the Children's Welfare Association and the Shanghai Children's Welfare Committee will still carry out the children's welfare matters that should be held during Children's Year in an orderly manner in accordance with the original plan.</p>

<h3>Great Success of Ma Sicong's Violin Recital</h3>
<p>Mr. Ma Sicong, a professor of music at Nanjing Central University, is a famous young violinist in our country. He was previously known as a musical prodigy and has performed in Hong Kong, Guangdong, and Shanghai. Chinese and foreign people have praised him greatly. Mr. Ma held a personal recital at the New Asia Auditorium on North Sichuan Road at 8:00 PM the night before last. However, there was no publicity beforehand, so few people in Shanghai knew about it. However, those who admired him and came to listen to his elegant performance were still very numerous. The hundreds of seats in the auditorium were already full. Among those present were the famous music critic Mr. Grolubat and Mr. Xiao Youmei, the president of the National Conservatory of Music, as well as celebrities Chen Jintao, Wen Zongyao, Li Zhaohuan, Feng Youwei, Mei Lanfang, and Japanese Senator Gu Xianrong, as well as many students from music schools and art schools.

At the end of the song, there was thunderous applause. At the end of the recital at 10:00 PM, the guests rushed to shake hands with Mr. Ma to pay their respects. It is heard that Mr. Ma plans to perform overseas next year to win glory for the country.</p>
<h3>Da You Heng Rice Shop Goes Bankrupt, Association Resolves to Investigate and Provide Relief</h3>
<p>Rice Merchants Plan to Sue in Court</p>
<p>As winter approaches and the end of the year draws near, various industries are affected by the economic panic and are unable to maintain themselves, resulting in bankruptcies. Da You Heng Kangji Rice Shop on Guangfu Road in Zhabei, which has been open for many years, has also gone bankrupt. According to the shop, the registered capital is 10,000 yuan, while the actual amount on the relief register is only 3,000 yuan, with 11,000 yuan owed to customers and 14,000 yuan in private debts. The owner of the shop, Yan Fukang, and the manager, Yan Fusheng, are brothers and the shop is solely owned and operated. However, when the shop opened, a false agreement was made and the association was deceptively asked to issue measures. After the bankruptcy of the shop, the North Shanghai Rice Shop Association, the Grain Sales Association, and the Rice Merchant Joint Association held a joint meeting at the Rice Shop Association on Kulun Road at 2:00 PM yesterday. The meeting was attended by Qiang Zisheng, Jiang Shiya, etc., and was chaired by Qiang Zisheng. It was resolved to investigate the shop's relief register, investigate the reasons for the bankruptcy, sue.</p>
<h3>Child Burned to Death in Fukang Lane on Avenue Joffre</h3>
<p>Cake Shop Oil Pot Catches Fire</p>
<p>Old Woman Unable to Save Neighbor's Child</p>
<p>The Fuxing Fujian Tea Food Cake and Candy Shop, opened by a Fujianese at No. 270 next door in Fukang Lane on Avenue Joffre</p>
<p>, at 0:30 PM yesterday (December 31st), while working on goods in the kitchen, the oil pot became too hot, and in an instant, green smoke billowed straight up, igniting debris. As a result, the fire was fierce and uncontrollable. The fire brigade, upon hearing the alarm, drove the belt car to the rescue, but the roof had already been pierced by the flames. Western and Chinese firefighters made every effort to extinguish the fire, which spread to the neighboring Jinde Tai Clothing Shop and Fuchang Rattan</p>
<p>Shop. After the fire was extinguished, it was learned that before the fire started, an old woman from the neighborhood was holding a child and leading another neighbor's five-year-old boy, chatting in the shop. Unexpectedly, after the fire started, she first carried the child she was holding out, and then went back to try to save the five-year-old boy, but the ladder had burned through, and she was unable to save him. The child died in the fire, burned beyond recognition, a tragic sight. Afterwards, the head of the French Police learned that the shop had fire insurance, and specially sent Western and Chinese detectives to inspect the scene and summoned the shop owner to the police station for verification.</p>

<h3>Job Application Status of Chinese People at Japanese Job Placement Center</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun, although the Shanghai Job Placement Center established by the Japanese on Jiaxing Road has not been open for long, it has been attracting a steady stream of job seekers in this time of economic recession. According to the report handled by the center for the end of 1934, from December 1st to 23rd, the total number of job seekers was 169, of which 48 were Japanese (38 men and 10 women) and 121 were Chinese (102 men and 19 women). The number of Chinese job seekers is approximately three times that of Japanese job seekers. The age of the job seekers, regardless of Chinese or Japanese, is approximately 25 years old. Among the Japanese, more than half are high school graduates, and approximately 3-4 have graduated from specialized schools or have equivalent qualifications. Most of the Chinese are primary school graduates, with 14-15 who have grown up in Japan and received Japanese university education. The hope of most of these job seekers is only to find a place to eat, without any extravagant expectations. Of these job seekers, a total of 28 have been recommended by the center for employment, including 17 Japanese (11 men and 6 women) and</p>
<p>11 Chinese (8 men and 3 women). The types of jobs are: 5 Japanese company employees, 5 shop clerks, 1 cook, 1 maid, 1 broker, and 1 waitress. Among the Chinese who found employment, there were 1 company employee, 1 shop clerk, 1 translator, 2 cooks, 3 waiters, 2 maids, and 1 wet nurse. Although the salary varies depending on the job, even graduates of specialized schools earn only 30-35 yuan. This is enough to show the increasingly difficult social economy.</p>
<h3>Worker at the Commercial Press Type Foundry Accused of Bigamy</h3>
<p>Xia Ruhei, a worker in the type foundry of the Commercial Press and a native of Dongtai, is 27 years old. In the past, by the order of his parents, he was betrothed to Wang Sidai (27 years old) of Wang Zhizhong, a native of Qingjiang, as his wife, and they were scheduled to be married on October 12th of the 21st year of the Republic [1932] at the Dabu Restaurant in Yangjiadu, South Market. However, Xia expressed dissatisfaction with this marriage, so even when the wedding day arrived, he continued to work as usual. After being strongly urged by relatives and friends, he reluctantly agreed to the marriage, but he did not consummate it and immediately left, renting a house at No. 6 Hexing Lane, Xinzha Road. Ms. Wang lives with her parents-in-law at No. 181 Yangjiadu, and it has been more than two years since. Although Xia and Ms. Wang are nominally husband and wife, they have never spent a single night together. Now, Hu Chengkang, a current court bailiff from Suzhou in Wu County, lives where Xia currently resides. Hu has a daughter named Genyuan, 19 years old, who is still unmarried. Hu saw that Xia had good character and believed that he had no family, so he promised his daughter to Xia. After their engagement in January of last year, Xia began cohabiting with Hu's daughter, who unexpectedly became pregnant and visibly large. Therefore, they chose July 6th to hold their wedding at the Fuxingguo Restaurant on Guangdong Road. Not long after, she gave birth to a child, who is now four months old. This matter came to the attention of Xia's wife, Ms. Wang, who, together with her father, Wang Zhizhong, seized Xia on Qingdao Road yesterday and handed him over to Chinese Constable No. 1074, who took him to the Xinzha Police Station and transferred him to the Laozha Police Station. After investigation by Chinese Detective Feng Xiushan yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special Court's Criminal Division One. The police lawyer, Ru Bao, explained the case, and he was charged with bigamy under Article 254 of the Criminal Law. Subsequently, Ms. Xia Wang, Wang Zhizhong, and Ms. Xia Hu submitted petitions outlining the circumstances. When questioned, the defendant denied marrying Ms. Xia Wang, stating that although he was present on that day, he did not bow to Heaven and Earth. He also claimed that his marriage to Ms. Hu was arranged by his father. Judge Qian Hongye then ordered them to attempt an out-of-court settlement but adjourned the hearing for a later date. The defendant was released on his own recognizance.</p>

It is believed that the audience, like a long drought hoping for clouds, will be overjoyed upon hearing this news and will participate with hearts eager to listen to the Dharma rain. In addition, the society has recently printed and distributed corrected editions of the Diamond Sutra in Song-style typeface. This edition has been carefully corrected by Mr. Jiang based on Tang Dynasty handwritten scriptures found in the Dunhuang Grottoes and various ancient versions.

Those who regularly read and wish to request a copy should attach postage of two and a half cents for out-of-town addresses and one cent for local addresses, and it will be sent immediately.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Orders the Issuance of Lists of Textbooks for Selection by Primary and Secondary Schools</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 31st Dispatch) The Ministry of Education has ordered each provincial and municipal education bureau, stating: "The methods for primary and secondary schools in each province and city to select textbooks for each subject have already been instructed in previous orders this year. Now, in order to enable each school to better understand which textbooks published by various publishers have been approved, which ones can still be used in the third year of junior high school, and which ones are outdated, we have specially formulated the following lists: one, a list of textbooks for junior high schools; one, a list of textbooks for primary schools; one, an appendix; and two, a total of four lists, each printed in three copies. We order that your bureau investigate and instruct all affiliated primary and secondary schools to no longer adopt textbooks at will but to select and use the books listed in Lists One and Two. If the lists do not include a textbook for a certain subject, teachers may edit and use teaching materials according to the official curriculum standards for each subject, but must still submit all teaching materials to the Ministry for review at the end of each semester. The books listed in the appendix are only allowed to be used in the third year of junior high school. Starting in the 24th year of the Republic [1935], they must be scrapped by the Ministry and may not be used again. This order must be followed."</p>

<h3>Representatives of the Anhui Education Consolidation Conference Petitioned in Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 31st Dispatch) The Anhui Local Education Consolidation Conference sent representatives Huang Daolin and five others to Nanjing to petition the authorities. They said that the local education funds in Anhui Province were affected by the drought this year, and the total revenue was only 1.2 million yuan. After the government abolishes excessive taxes and surcharges on farmland, the provincial authorities will abolish them in phases. The first phase, which has already been abolished, was 250,000 yuan related to education revenue. The second phase will be implemented soon and will require another 250,000 yuan to be abolished. This means that education funding will be greatly reduced and difficult to maintain in the future, and the future will be on the verge of bankruptcy. This trip to Nanjing is to petition the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Finance and Education. The two main points of the request are: 1. Before a proper replacement method is developed for the abolition of excessive taxes and surcharges related to educational surtaxes, please allow Anhui to continue to collect one tenth of the taxes on tobacco and alcohol and allow educational surcharges to continue to be collected.</p>

<h3>Thirteen Months of Teacher Salary Arrears in Changshu: The Plight of the Educational Sector</h3>
<p>Unclear amount owed, difficult to settle temporarily</p>
<p>Teachers' lives insecure, waves of unrest arise</p>
<p>(Changshu Correspondence) Educational funding in this county has been in arrears for up to thirteen months. The teachers' salaries for this academic year have only been paid up to September. Elementary school teachers, due to financial difficulties, have sparked three waves of salary demands. The educational authorities, besides running to major banks and borrowing here and there to barely cope with the immediate situation, regard the salary issue as a major crisis. Furthermore, due to the many internal factions within the educational sector in this county, the fact of salary arrears is used as the sole target of attack. If the educational authorities do not have a unified method for clearing the salary arrears, especially with the end of the year approaching and the time for summarizing accounts quickly arriving, the disputes over the future of the educational sector are far from over. The situation of salary arrears is investigated as follows:</p>
<h3>Situation of Arrears</h3>
<p>The educational funding in this county has been in arrears for thirteen months in total, both past and present. How much is owed in total? Most teachers and principals are very unclear. Even the responsible educational authorities cannot provide a definite figure. Some say that the arrears over the years amount to 750,000 yuan, but this figure is based on the budget estimates over the years. The revenue from land taxes is calculated based on the nominal amount, and the actual amount is not verified and deducted based on the autumn harvest, which does not match the actual revenue. According to general estimates from the educational sector, with monthly teacher salaries ranging from 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, the arrears over the years should be around 200,000 yuan. However, these arrears date back to 1922, spanning twelve years. Some schools have cleared their arrears due to changes in management, while others have not yet cleared them. Some have borrowed half or a small portion of the amount. The situation is complex. Whether these arrears are due to uncollected land taxes, misappropriation, or other reasons, the educational authorities are even more unclear. This is truly an unprecedented muddled account.</p>
<h3>Teachers' Livelihood</h3>
<p>As for the treatment of elementary school teachers, salaries have traditionally been based solely on qualifications, divided into three levels, leading to significant abuses and unfair treatment. Last year, after a special inspection, the three levels were used as base salaries, and increases or decreases were given based on performance. Senior elementary school teachers' salaries ranged from 22 to 30 yuan, specialized teachers ranged from 18 to 26 yuan, and junior elementary school teachers ranged from 18 to 26 yuan. Part-time teachers ranged from 12 to 20 yuan, all divided into three levels, with each level differing by two yuan. Usually, teachers in each school receive the base salary, which is already a very small amount. Moreover, only one month's salary was paid in the first half of this year, and nothing has been received from October onwards, since the salaries were paid from July to September of the second half of this year. Consequently, waves of salary demands have been sparked three times. In one instance, the director of the education bureau was surrounded by the crowd and unable to cope, bursting into tears in public at the county government office. In another instance, he escaped the encirclement through the back door of the education bureau. Although he usually runs to major banks to borrow funds, most of the education bureau's loans are extended, and credit has gradually been lost, leading to no results. After this year's drought, it is difficult to see any improvement in the collection of land taxes. Teachers' salaries have also been ordered by the provincial government to be paid at an 80% rate, reducing income and increasing financial difficulties, making the need for funds even more urgent. The educational authorities regard raising funds as the only difficulty. With no solution to the economic problem, the educational cause has come to a standstill. Furthermore, due to the many factions within the educational sector in this county, the educational authorities' measures regarding salaries lack definite solutions, leading them to be used as the target of attack. With the end of the year approaching and the time for settling accounts quickly arriving, if salaries cannot be paid, the disputes over the future of the educational sector are far from over.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Arrears</h3>
<p>Since there is no definite amount of salary arrears and there are no solutions, the fundamental question is what are the reasons for the arrears? According to the reporter's extensive investigations, the reasons for the arrears over the years are no more than the following: (1) The budgeted income for educational funding each year is based on the nominal amount of land tax, without actual reduction based on the autumn harvest, which leads to inflated income and actual expenditure, with the expenditure increasing accordingly. In reality, the tax revenue in the last five years has averaged less than 50%, so the income cannot offset the expenditure. For example, this year's budget still includes the nominal amount of 372,274 yuan in revenue, repeating the same mistake. (2) The education bureau has lacked supervision over the financial aspects over the years, leading to the former head of the land tax collection office, Hua Zhaozeng, embezzling over 16,000 yuan through fraud. He later escaped, and has not been apprehended for several years. Currently, this case has been judged by the Wuxi Court, and only 39.26 mu of his land has been transferred to cover the civil part of the judgment. The magnitude of the loss is evident. (3) The education bureau's school properties are scattered in the countryside, a situation that has persisted for a long time without investigation and organization, leading to unclear boundaries. Who is farming the land? What about the old fallow land that has not matured? What about the new fallow land? The authorities have no knowledge of any of this. (4) The budgeted revenue from the slaughter tax is over 7,500 yuan per year. From September 1931 to the present, the contractor Jin Ji has been in arrears for 7,027 yuan, and Zhu Deshan owes 4,575 yuan. The educational authorities have also been lenient and have not pursued these debts. (Correspondent Yu Bingchen's communication to this newspaper)</p>

<h3>Social Education Society's Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition Opens Today</h3>
<p>Opening Ceremony at 9:00 AM at the People's Education Center</p>
<p>Director Pan and Others Have Exquisite Works Participating</p>
<p>The Shanghai Social Education Society, in order to encourage the calligraphy and painting interests of its members and to raise funds for improving serialized picture storybooks, is holding a calligraphy and painting exhibition of its members, scheduled to open today at the Municipal People's Education Center. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Opening Today The opening ceremony will be held today at 9:00 AM at the Municipal People's Education Center on Wenmiao Road, combined with the New Year's Day celebration. Directors and supervisors of the society, such as Ding Shoutang, Yuan Zengzhu, and Lü Hailan, will deliver speeches and entertain guests. There are over 100 works, displayed in the Dacheng Hall exhibition room and other places. Calligraphy and painting tickets will be issued, priced at ten yuan per ticket, with random drawings.

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council's Middle Schools to Hold Joint Examinations</h3>
<p>The Education Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council has recently formulated three measures regarding the graduation joint examination: (1) Starting in June 1935, the five Chinese middle schools will hold a joint examination at a suitable location. The exam questions should be as consistent as possible, and elective subjects should be offered to students from each school. (2) The previous proposal to invite external personnel to supervise the examination of special subjects will be temporarily postponed, pending the results of the above examination. (3) Graduates from each school should be encouraged to participate in the Shanghai Municipal Middle School Graduation Joint Examination. Upon investigation, the curriculum of the Shanghai Municipal Council's middle schools still has discrepancies, making it inconvenient to enforce uniformity abruptly. Moreover, the schools have already been recognized by the government, and students can participate in the municipal joint examination. However, the subcommittee believes that it is permissible to retain the option of inviting external personnel to supervise special experiments. This case was submitted to the Board of Directors, which resolved to adopt and implement it.</p>
<h3>Zhou Fo-hai Returns to Zhenjiang Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Zhou Fo-hai, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, came to Shanghai from the province on the 28th. The next morning, he attended the opening ceremony of the new campus of the Shanghai Provincial High School, as reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that Zhou has completed his business in Shanghai and returned to Zhenjiang by train at 8:00 AM this morning. It is said that Zhou's visit was solely for attending the ceremony of Shanghai Provincial High School and there were no other tasks.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Considers Tuition Fees</h3>
<p>Should Fee Reductions for Families with Multiple Students Enrolled Be Maintained?</p>
<p>The Education Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council has recently given detailed consideration to the question of whether families with multiple students enrolled in the Shanghai Municipal Council's schools should continue to receive tuition fee reductions as before. According to a report submitted by the head of the Finance Department, the current regulations provide that, except for primary schools, families with two students enrolled receive an 80% fee reduction, those with three students receive a 70% fee reduction, and those with four or more students receive a one-third reduction. The total amount of these fee reductions each year is approximately 62,500 yuan. The Shanghai Municipal Council's principle has always been that educational expenses are largely paid for by tax revenue. Therefore, it seems problematic to give special benefits to a small number of people simply because they have many children. Moreover, those who receive these benefits do not necessarily need them. Furthermore, this practice is not found in Chinese academic circles. In the Shanghai Municipal Council's middle schools, families with one or more students enrolled are generally quite wealthy and do not necessarily have economic difficulties.</p>
<p>For the above reasons, the Finance Department suggests that, starting in the spring semester, the practice of fee reductions in all Chinese children's schools should be abolished. This would increase tuition revenue by approximately 22,000 yuan, which could be used to expand education, such as establishing scholarships, which would be more appropriate.</p>
<p>The situation in foreign children's schools is slightly different. The head of the Finance Department argues that the fee reduction for families with two students should be changed to 90%, for three students to 85%, and for four or more students to 80%. This would increase tuition revenue by 17,000 yuan, which could also be used for scholarships and subsidies.</p>
<p>After discussion, some argued that this practice of fee reductions is not found elsewhere, and it is difficult to determine whether students come from the same family. Therefore, it is not convenient to implement the change immediately. One committee member suggested that the Chinese girls' middle school should continue to follow the old regulations to promote female education, while the Chinese boys' middle school should follow the example of foreign children's schools. Another committee member said that the parents of students in the Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese schools, especially the parents of female students, are mostly wealthy. Since the Shanghai Municipal Council already bears two-thirds of the educational expenses, the parents should pay the remaining one-third in full. Moreover, the facilities of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese schools are superior compared to those of other schools, while the facilities of the Shanghai Municipal Council's foreign children's schools are inferior compared to those of other schools, but the tuition fees are much higher. As a result of the discussion, the chairman of the committee suggested that the fee reduction system be abolished altogether, and that special cases be given assistance. The head of the Education Department believed that this proposal was feasible, but was concerned that parents would be unwilling to have their financial situation investigated. Moreover, not all parents are wealthy, so abolishing the fee reduction would inevitably cause some pain. He suggested that scholarships could be increased or the number of free places could be expanded. As a result of the committee's discussion, no decision was reached and it will be discussed again at a later date.</p>
<p>The Tenth Anniversary of the National Language Movement Held Today</p>
<p>Celebration Held at Shanghai Radio Station Yesterday</p>
<p>Lu Yi-yan and Others Report on the Association's Work</p>
<p>National Language Construction Year Opening Ceremony to be Held Today</p>
<p>The National Association for the Promotion of National Language Education, in order to expand the anniversary celebration and complete the first ten-year plan, has designated this year as the National Language Movement Construction Year, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. The proceedings of the meeting are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Preliminary Celebrations Yesterday</h3>
<p>Starting at 5:00 PM yesterday, the association held a celebration at the Shanghai Broadcasting Station. After the ceremony, (1) Lu Yi-yan delivered an opening speech, stating, "In the summer of 1925, Yi-yan and others, aware that the warlord government was about to implement measures to undermine national language education, immediately traveled north and south, united comrades, and first tentatively held a National Language Movement Conference in Taiyuan, Shanxi on August 20th. On September 5th, another National Language Movement Conference was tentatively held in Beijing. On September 18th and 19th, another National Language Movement Conference was tentatively held in Shanghai. The results of the trials were very good. On October 1st, the General Preparatory Office of the National Language Movement Conference was officially established in Shanghai, and it was resolved that the period from January 1st to 31st, 1926, would be the term of the National Language Movement Conference, and the conference proceedings would be printed, detailing papers and methods of the National Language Movement, and distributed to comrades at home and abroad, and prepared the movement in good faith. Since the 1st day of January of the fifteenth year of the Republic, eighty-six places in all parts of the country, as well as various ports in Japan and Nanyang, have successively held large-scale National Language Movement Conferences in their own localities, united the people, and supervised the government to dispel the motives of the national language, therefore, this conference decided that January 1st of each year is the National Language Movement Memorial Day. After the end of the movement conference, the comrades believed that it was necessary to establish a permanent organ, so the National Association for the Promotion of National Language Education was organized, and after several months of preparation, it was officially established in Shanghai on September 1st, 1926. In 1930, in order to facilitate assistance to the government to promote national language education throughout the country, it moved to Nanjing and set up an office in Shanghai. This is the origin of the National Language Movement Conference and the National Association for the Promotion of National Language Education. On the economic side, the association is extremely short of money, and the comrades use their spare time, sacrifice their own blood and sweat, and work hard for nine years. Although there are no great achievements, there are still memorable facts, so today we are holding a small meeting to celebrate, hoping that the comrades will cheer up, continue to struggle, earnestly build, carry forward the spirit of the association, and complete the ten-year plan, so that the national language education can be popularized as soon as possible," and so on. (2) Ms. Ruan Huijuan and others sang the National Language Movement Song. (3) Zu Yuren reported on the publicity work over the years. (4) Members of the Flying Sound Troupe sang new songs. (5) Pei Weisen reported on the achievements of the promotion over the years. (6) Members of the Flying Sound Troupe sang new songs.</p>
<h3>Founding of Enterprises</h3>
<p>(7) Ma Guoying reported briefly, "The association's enterprises have not been able to be carried out as much as possible due to economic relations.

<h3>Municipal Stadium Football Charity Match for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Match Time: 10 AM on the 3rd</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Stadium previously received a letter from the Shanghai Municipal Disaster Relief Donation Committee, requesting assistance in raising funds for disaster relief. The Committee was allowed to hold receipts for donations collected at the Guangdong vs. Langya A team finals of the Ping-Pong Competition last night to allow people to enter the stadium to watch the match. This was done to appeal to the spirit of sports and to help the victims of the widespread disasters. The stadium director, Wang Zhuangfei, believing that the disaster areas were vast and the disaster victims were numerous, and that a drop in the bucket would not solve the problem, consulted with the Shen Xing team players and outstanding talents from this year's Industry and Commerce Football Association, and agreed to hold a disaster relief match at the stadium's football field at 10:30 AM on the 3rd of this month (Thursday). All the players also put the disaster victims first, generously fulfilling their obligations, and stadium instructor Zhang Longhai will serve as the referee. It is reported that the method of entering the stadium to watch the match is as follows: for every donation of two jiao of small money, the stadium will issue a donation receipt for two jiao. Holding this receipt will allow entry to watch the match. (Receipts from watching the Ping-Pong Competition cannot be used again.) The back of the donation receipt will be stamped with the stadium's seal. Donations and receipt stubs collected will be sent to the Shanghai Municipal Disaster Relief Donation Committee to ensure transparency. During the match, Captain Pan of the Second Team of the Hu Nan District Security Corps will be invited to maintain order. Philanthropic gentlemen will surely come to watch and support this righteous cause. The lineups of the two teams are recorded below:</p>
<p>Industry and Commerce Mixed Team</p>

Yinghua's defense was better than its offense, so it lost fewer points. The second match was between Southeast A and Leyi Girls' Middle School.

<h3>Finance: Gold Market Ultimately Returns to Stability</h3>
<p>Slight Fatigue Mid-Course, but Still Rises in the End</p>
<p>Compares to a Good Start, Up Three Yuan Three Jiao</p>
<p>The gold market yesterday was characterized by mediocre trading due to the end of the Gregorian year. The volume was narrow. Major players were observing, making the market susceptible to fluctuations, but the trend was stable. There was a slight weakening mid-course, but it still rose in the end. The market situation was particularly sluggish. In the morning, overseas silver markets in both the UK and US rose in unison. The forward silver price from Montedelli also rose by two points. Exchange rates were flat. London spot gold rose by one penny, but the market was unmoved. Pre-market preparations opened at 66.70 yuan. Fuxing, Yongda, Decheng, Yifeng, Yongheng, Xingyuan, and others all made provisions. The volume was still narrow. It immediately rose, once reaching 71 yuan, then fell slightly. The Central Bank's posted rates were announced. The British rate rose by 1.25, the American rate rose by 0.25, and the Customs Gold Unit fell by 0.013. The standard price of gold retreated to 992.3 yuan. Despite the market's timidity, the major players were unmoved. This was because the swap spread was being paid out by the bulls by more than ten yuan. The settlement price should have been suppressed. The buy-side was still eager. After opening, it once rose above 70 yuan. Major players took advantage of the high price to sell aggressively. The market was originally trending downwards, which led to fluctuations. However, because the banks were still bullish, it rebounded after falling low, but did not break out of 70 yuan. After entering, supply and demand balanced, and the market stabilized. Upon learning of the HSBC posted rates, both the British and American rates were flat. The situation was hovering. Later, the banks repeatedly offered, and sellers continued to be active, which led to another decline. However, there was still support at the low price, and the banks also traded against each other. It gradually rebounded. The silver balancing tax was announced, rising by 0.25, levied at 6.625 percent, calculated with the British exchange rate at 1 shilling 5 pence 6875. At this time, the situation circled around. However, because Traffic and others were selling, it appeared weak. Transactions within the exchange were limited, leading to an oversupply. Retail investors also collapsed one after another, which led to a downward trend. However, once major players came up to buy aggressively, it immediately rebounded. This is the phenomenon that should be expected with a narrow market and the end of the Gregorian year. Finally, the exchange market was quiet. Supply and demand within the exchange were even scarcer, lacking considerable counterparts. Therefore, the ups and downs were frequent, ultimately lacking special changes. The after-market opened peacefully. Major players' buying interests were quite strong. It was immediately pulled up. Transactions within the exchange were not smooth, and the market was prone to change. Exchange rates were the same, making it extremely difficult to settle. After major players repeatedly competed to buy, it broke out of the 70 yuan barrier, rising quite rapidly. The banks sold at high prices. Although there was a setback, the preposterous rumors arose again. Sellers took a wait-and-see attitude. There was still a bullish wind. The banks still sold at high prices. There was also a supply of sources at the high price. The first report from Indian silver reported a rise of 11 anna and then fell. However, because London bulk rose sharply, Mumbai should have been firm. The market was still stable. At this time, it still rebounded. When the second report from Indian silver reported a further rise of 2 anna, major players had sales interests. Retail investors were again panicked. After this, supply surged, and it retreated into the 70 yuan barrier. However, the closing situation was still attractive. It was found that the New Year's market was exceptionally dull for both supply and demand sides due to the three-day closure. Any change would easily lead to ups and downs. However, the boom was temporary. The day's market situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 969.5 yuan, a rebound of 2.8 yuan compared to last Saturday afternoon's close. The Central Bank's posted rates were announced. The Customs Gold Unit fell by 0.013, retreating to 9 yuan. The situation was more chaotic. Hongxing and others bought aggressively, rising to 70.5 yuan. However, the market ultimately weakened due to the Customs Gold Unit's severe fall. With major players such as Shunmao, Fuxing, Yongda, Dafa, Yongyuanchang, Yongyuqing, Yong, and others competing to sell, it fell to 67 yuan. Hengyu and Hengxingyuan Fuxingyong came to buy blocks. Zhengjin hedged January at 625, rebounding to above 9 yuan. It was learned in advance that the HSBC bank's British and American exchange rates were unchanged. After this, the situation was peaceful. Shunli Dafa Yongyuanmao Yong and others sold to around 8 yuan. Hengyu Qingyu Shunmao and others went ahead and circled around. HSBC came out with 875. Hengyu Fuyu Yuanyi Qian Changxiang Fuxing Yongyu Kang and others divested one after another, gradually retreating to 5.5 yuan. Hanhang Hengyu included blocks, rebounding to 6.8 yuan. Mitsui came out with January 625. Yuanyi still sold, retreating to 6 yuan. Shunmao Hengyu Yongli Dalian bang Dadecheng Yuanmao Yong and others took advantage of the low price to enter together. It quickly rebounded to above 8 yuan. Yifeng Yongda Decheng Hengyu Fuyu and others sold blocks, retreating to 6.8 yuan. The silver balancing tax was announced, rising by 0.25, but the situation was still flat. Afterwards, due to Yuanmao Yong and retail investors coming in, it rose again to above 8 yuan. Traffic again issued March 3125. Dafa Yongyu Qingyong Hengyu came from Kang Huixiang Zhaofeng Changda Kang and others continuously divested, and the floating bulls collapsed one after another. Transactions were again low, and gradually retreated to 4.2 yuan. Qingyu Shunmao Qian Changxiang Yuqing Yong Zhaofeng Changshengda and others took advantage of the low price to buy in unison, rebounding to 7 yuan. Hanhang Fuxingyong divested, falling to 5.3 yuan. Dadecheng Sheng Yong Fuxing and others still entered, actually pushing it to 7.6 yuan. Dadecheng Tongtaichang took advantage of the high price to divest. February 4375 was difficult to sell, and it fell. Yuanmao Yong Fuxing also sold, again retreating to 5.7 yuan. After this, transactions were even quieter, lacking a corresponding counterparty. Chunyuan Yongfuxing slightly took in, rising to 6.8 yuan. Dadecheng Fuxingyong sold, falling to 5.2 yuan. Fuyu entered blocks, rising to 6.4 yuan. Dalian bang came out and then entered, with the situation uncertain. It later retreated to 5.1 yuan. The closing price was 966.2 yuan. The after-market was slightly weak.</p>
<p>The after-market opened at 966.9 yuan. The start was flat, once retreating to 6 yuan. Dade Yuanmao Yongyuankang Xiang and others entered blocks, rising to 8.4 yuan. Tongfeng Hengheng Yuyu offered blocks, retreating to 7.6 yuan. March 25 was difficult to settle. The market therefore strengthened. Chips were scarce. Once the buying wind started, a short squeeze was also launched. Major players such as Yuanmao Yong Yuanyi Yuqing Yong Zhengchang Dadecheng and others competed to buy, and it rose to 74 yuan. At this time, March 1875 also had no sellers. Fuxing Yong Fuyu Yicheng Hengxing divested. The British McCallum came out with March 1875, falling to 1.2 yuan. Hengyu Fuxingyong suddenly entered. Yuxin Xiang Yingxiang and others also entered. Qiaozhi Fu, though selling March 25, all the banks had buying interests. It quickly rebounded to 4.2 yuan. Yifeng Yonglei Decheng took advantage of the high price to divest, gradually trending downwards. However, because the buy-side was still eager, there was considerable circling. When the first report from Indian silver reported a rise of 11, 14, 13 anna, the Dalian bang Changda Yuli and others came to sell, falling to 1.8 yuan. Yuanmao Yong Tongfu still entered, rising to 3.5 yuan. Tianfeng Yong Qingfa Yong came up to dump, falling to 1.3 yuan. Yuanmao Yong and others slightly entered, again rising to 2.6 yuan. The second report from Indian silver reported a rise of 2, 2, 2 anna. Fuyu Tianfeng Yongda Changxiang and others sold blocks. The floating accounts shook, falling to 68.8 yuan. Wanchang Yong Yuqing Yong and others took advantage of the low price to enter. Transactions were still low. It quickly rebounded to 70.6 yuan.

The Central Bank's official rates were announced, with the British pound up 0.125 and the US dollar up 0.25.  Customs Gold Units fell again by 0.013.  Although the Chinese merchants' sentiment was weak, it was maintained due to the banks' buying interest.

Although the banks slightly released after entering, Zhejiang, China was still buying. The Silver Equalization Tax was announced, rising 0.25, calculated at 6.25%.  The British pound was calculated at 1 shilling 5.6875 pence.  There was still maneuvering at this time, but the underlying trend seemed loose.  Later, Bank of Communications suddenly sold shillings, making the domestic market firm, mainly because the Chinese merchants' sentiment was weak.  Subsequent trading was flat, and the banks' appetite was not strong, so the process tightened immediately after the rumor of positive news.  Later, banks supplied at high prices, and the Jewish merchant George Joe also sold.  In addition, Indian silver rose twice in a row, and after tightening, it was slightly flat. The closing price for near-term selling was a British pound at 1 shilling 4.8125 pence, and the US dollar at 34.6875 yuan. Compared to last Saturday, the British pound was flat and the US dollar tightened by 0.0625.

<h3>Call Loan Market Slightly Loosens, Settlement Procedures Very Cumbersome</h3>
<p>Business conditions in all sectors have been poor this year, and the flow of funds has been difficult. Few have completed the final settlement for yesterday's New Year's Eve, and many have postponed it, resulting in even more difficult settlements. However, settlement procedures will inevitably be numerous. Yesterday, the banks on the Bund and the Chinese banks, money shops, and companies settled with each other, and the amounts were very large. The call loan market opened at 5.5 fen in both the morning and afternoon, slightly less than 0.5 fen from the previous day's market price, and the situation remained firm. However, because some banks made loans by adding water to the draft, there was a small decline. It started at 5.5 fen, then 6 fen, and finally decreased from 2.8 fen to 2 fen at the close. In the Small Clearing House, only 1.45 fen was made. Regarding call loan transactions, more than 1.7 million was transferred in the morning market, more than 300,000 in new transactions, more than 800,000 in the afternoon market, and more than 600,000 in the Small Clearing House. All were call loans to be repaid after three days, because New Year's Day and the 2nd were closing days, so there had to be a three-day term, which is different from the usual one-day term. Regarding foreign secured loan transactions, Chinese banks and money shops made more than 5.2 million in new transactions, foreign banks made more than 4 million, the purchase amount was more than 6.8 million, and the recovery and issuance of banknotes was 1.67 million. The sources and destinations were all stopped. Bank settlements: because there were so many settlements at the end of the year, it was impossible to calculate them all at once, but it was estimated that no less than tens of millions were involved. Money shops and foreign public bills also had a lot of settlements, totaling 70 to 80 million. Foreign draft loans also had more than 20 million in settlements. Remittances from various sources were 600 to 700 thousand. There were no accurate statistics on the settlement of cash, but it was generally said that more than 1 million was settled.</p>
<p>In addition, the total number of checks exchanged by the local check exchange office on the 31st was 39,475,780.52 silver dollars, including 23,083,266.80 silver dollars and 16,392,513.72 silver dollars in drafts.</p>
<h3>Prices of Silver, Copper, and Subsidiary Coins All Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small silver coins were priced at 870 yuan in the morning market, and fell back 5 yuan in the afternoon market, to 865 yuan. As a result, it improved 5 yuan compared with the previous day. 8,000 jiao were traded in the morning market and 4,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver coins were priced at 759.5 yuan in the morning market, and improved by 0.5 yuan in the afternoon market, to 760 yuan. 240,000 jiao were traded in the morning market and 125,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins decreased by 500 wen, to 305,000 wen. 33,550 strings were traded, equivalent to 11,000 silver dollars.</p>
<h3>High Call Loan Rate Last Month Leads to Higher Deposit Interest Rates</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Money Trade Association held a regular meeting. Regarding the deposit interest rate proposal, it was generally agreed that the foreign call loan rate was very high in December, reaching a maximum of 6 jiao and a minimum of more than 2 jiao. As such, the total daily statistics amounted to 10.24 yuan. Therefore, the deposit interest rate was bound to increase accordingly. As a result, the rate was set at 9.5 yuan and 95 deductions, which is vastly different from the usual 2 yuan and 95 deductions. As such, the highest price for outstanding interest would be in the range of 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities: US Stock Market Continues to Advance</h3>
<p>New Fung &amp; Co. reported that yesterday (the 29th), the New York stock market continued to advance under the momentum of the previous day and due to optimistic hopes for dividends, led by General Electric. Later, profit-takers engaged in liquidation, showing a slight loosening, but the market's resistance was excellent. Steel stocks were quite firm, because the amount of steel work in the Youngstown district is expected to rise to 50% within 10 days due to large orders from the automotive industry. The bond market was boosted by the stock market, characterized by the outstanding performance of railroad and public utility bonds. The conditions on the Small Exchange also rose. Chicago wheat was down slightly due to a sharp drop in corn, and the drop in corn was caused by forecasts of warmer weather, leading to large-scale selling. Half-day trading volume was 760,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York indices are as follows:</p>
<p>|             | 28th        | 29th        | Change    |</p>
<p>| :---------- | :---------- | :---------- | :-------- |</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Slight Spot Transactions</h3>
<p>The yarn and cotton market is still good, and the customer banks are still buying well. Because foreign cotton is stable, people are hopeful, and Southern demand is healthier, but the standard yarn market is closed due to the year-end settlement. According to statistics, the customer banks bought 927 bales of spot yarn, and the prices rose by 0.25 to 0.5 yuan. The purchase amounts of each bank are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 622, Changsha 190, Yunnan 80, Inland 35</p>
<p>The cotton market is firm. Because American cotton rose slightly and Indian cotton is quite expensive, but due to the New Year holidays, the factories are not operating smoothly, so there are very few transactions. There are no sources at all. The price of Shandong coarse cotton is 39.9 yuan. Xin Shen Factory entered 1,060 pieces, and spot goods were sent to the factory.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Yarn Market Lacks Vigor</h3>
<p>(Tianjin News) The cotton yarn market in this city is still flat due to the end of the year. The customer bank business is still sluggish. Shenze Bank bought 20 bales of 16-count San Guang yarn for 175.5 yuan. Xianghe Bank bought 75 bales of 16-count Ba Ma yarn for 176.25 yuan. The above includes unified tax. Also, Qingdao yarn was traded, and Gaoyang Bank bought 60 bales of 32-count Huadie yarn for 231 yuan, and bought another 30 bales for 230.05 yuan.</p>
<h3>Bombay Cotton Industry Weekly Report</h3>
<p>The futures market last week was very tense due to the delayed movement of new cotton and the extreme shortage of sellers. Export merchants continued to trade, all for regular transportation. At the same time, the selling of old cotton was also widespread. Inquiries from Japan were very good. Europe bought slightly when prices rose. However, Lancashire had no transactions for any cotton except for Pingguoer cotton. New cotton estimates were slightly reduced. Most of the cotton is stored in the hands of cotton farmers.</p>
<p>According to a Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for White Lorikeet cotton on the 31st was 243 rupees, up 2 rupees from the previous day's close.</p>
<h3>Retrospective of Standard Yarn and Cotton in the 23rd Year</h3>
<p>The yarn market conditions in the 23rd year of the Republic of China were most pessimistic in the spring months of January, February, March, and April, because of the decline of domestic rural areas, the depression of commerce, and the great lack of purchasing power in all directions. The political situation in North China was clouded, and the exchange experienced a reform trend in standard yarn. In addition, there was a shareholders' association to deal with standard issues. The struggle between the two factions was particularly fierce. As a result, on February 28th of this year, the Ren Zhong standard yarn, which had been established for more than ten years, was suddenly removed, and Jinji yarn was changed to the standard. At that time, the yarn market was extremely weak, and people were panicked. The market price fell in a straight line. Although a certain factory owner proposed to maintain the yarn price, he once convened the leaders of Chinese factories to discuss methods. However, the factory owners only cared about their own immediate interests, and not only were unwilling to cooperate, but also undermined each other. Therefore, Japanese merchants took the opportunity to sell in large quantities, and the pressure was even greater. The tragedy of the fall in the price of standard yarn in April was terrifying, like a dam breaking and pouring down thousands of miles, creating an unprecedented new record. The low peak saw 160.03 yuan, which was only equivalent to 114.6 taels of silver under the old rules, which was 6.7 taels lower than the lowest peak of 121.3 taels in the yarn and cloth market since July of the 10th year (formerly 16-count standard, now 20-count standard, and according to the grading table, it should be 5 taels higher). It is said that in this big decline, foreign merchants made a lot of profit. Later, by May and June, the old goods stored at the bottom of the standard cotton gradually decreased. Tongji Cotton Company purchased in large quantities, manipulated and went long, and cotton prices rose. The market situation was implicitly recovering. Unexpectedly, things must be reversed, which is the normal course of events. Low prices have triggered real demand. Because yarn was cheap and cotton was expensive, the factories' difficulties deepened and business became more difficult. They had to adopt the method of reducing work to maintain the factory base. More and more people stopped work and reduced work, and production decreased. The situation in North China turned safe, and the implementation of mail and train services was resolved. As a result, the spot sales market in the north developed. At this time, the price of Chinese coarse yarn was cheaper than that of Japanese yarn. Tianjin banks came to Shanghai to purchase in large quantities, causing the yarn market, which had been tired and depressed for a long time, to gradually turn around. The Jinji standard yarn rose straight from 168.9 yuan to 180 yuan. In mid-July and August, the US suffered a severe drought, and the trend of US cotton was stable. At the same time, our country was also suffering from drought, and reports of cotton production damage were urgent. Flour and miscellaneous grains rose sharply first, and the financial community profited greatly, changed its plans, and entered the standard yarn market to engage in purchases. In addition, a rumor broke out at the Shenxin Factory, and there was a lot of discussion in the market, saying that the factory's production capacity was quite strong. If it were to stop operating, the impact on the market would be significant. For a time, new buyers poured in like a tide. Tianjin banks searched for coarse yarn, and the factories' yarn was sold out. The market situation became tighter and tighter, and there was a scene of enthusiasm. A further rise in the standard yarn price was realized (on August 9, the highest peak for the January standard yarn in the 23rd year was 192 yuan). By mid-September, Tongcheng Company sold short, and domestic cotton fields increased. Because agricultural products were particularly cheap last year, the villagers were happy to plant cotton. The low peak of the standard cotton price was 33.2 jiao. The yarn market, which was closely related, was slightly hit. Unexpectedly, the United States implemented a policy of buying silver, and the price of silver rose sharply. The price of gold became shorter. The rise of silver and the contraction of gold were very unfavorable to the price of goods in our country. The Shanghai money market became increasingly tight, and the East Exchange soared to 130 yuan. Japanese merchants used their 8-jiao exchange rate to sell as much as possible in the standard yarn market. The actual sales of customers turned stagnant due to the high price, and the pressure from the sellers was even greater. The market price fell faster and faster. On October 6, the lowest peak for the October standard yarn was 168.5 yuan. In mid-October, November, and December, the National Government, in view of the increasing outflow of silver and the apparent panic and anxiety of the Shanghai economy, increased the export tax on silver and added an equalization tax in order to maintain the stability of Shanghai's finance. The price of gold soared, and all prices rose together, causing the depressed yarn market to suddenly experience a violent surge. Tongcheng Company turned from short to long, and the banking community also bought in vigorously. The standard yarn price jumped wildly by 8.5 yuan. The March standard yarn saw 190.05 yuan, and Henan, Zhengzhou, Tianjin, and other places were buying 17-count yarn very actively. The demand in the South, Guangdong, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Fujian was active, so that the stored yarn of more than 100,000 bales gradually decreased to about 60,000 bales. Therefore, the intentions of many parties became more and more intense. In November, Tongcheng Company alone received more than 10,000 bales of standard yarn. Rumors of paper money in the business community rose repeatedly, and the theory of currency inflation was revived. The pull of the long companies became stronger and stronger. In December, Tongcheng Company received only 1,600 bales of goods, but the final price rose wildly by more than 2 yuan to 187 yuan, creating the highest peak for the end of each month this year. It is found that the amount of buyers Tongcheng Company and Tongji Company is about 50,000 bales, and Tongcheng Company has continuously received more than 10,000 bales of spot yarn. The sellers are a Japanese factory and a certain foreign firm with 30,000 bales, and other manufacturers have about 20,000 to 30,000 bales of hedged positions. The positions of both the long and short sides are strong. The highest and lowest prices, delivery prices, delivery numbers, and total transaction numbers for the standard yarn in one year are listed in the table below for reference.</p>
<p>| Gold Chicken Standard Cotton Yarn | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Delivery Price | Delivery Number | Total Transaction Number |</p>
<p>| :------------------------------- | :----------- | :---------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------------- |</p>
<p>| January Term                      | 174.40       | 170.00      | 170.00         | 700            | 274,150              |</p>
<p>| (1) Note: January, February, March and April terms were still 20 count Ren Zhong as the standard. (2) Note: The standard yarn transaction number for the December term was only recorded until the 21st. The exchange does not announce it after that.</p>
<h3>Grain: New Year's Day Has Arrived, Rice Market Closed for Two Days</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various banks were particularly scarce, only a total of fifteen or sixteen (goods totaling more than 3,000 shi). And because the market is closed for two days for the New Year's Day, each store added a little inventory. The market prices of each thick japonica rice and late rice saw a return to stability. Du Yang tip is also stable because it follows each other. Only the arrival of Yin Yuan goods is slightly more, and it is still tired. However, Bian Yuan is also not much different.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the He Xia banks reached ship number 26 and 27. Because it was the end of the Gregorian calendar year, few buyers went to market. The buyers had no intention of selling, so the outflow of goods of various colors was flat. The market price of white japonica rice and various Bian Yin Yuan early rice and other goods did not fluctuate much.</p>
<h3>Sesame: Foreign Firm Opens at 9.8 Yuan</h3>
<p>Sparse Transactions in Miscellaneous Grains at the End of the Year</p>
<p>Yesterday's miscellaneous grain market was sparse because it was the end of the year and the market was closed for two days next year (on the 1st and 2nd). Only the Dade Xin Oil Factory bought 2,000 bags of Guide beans for 3.615 yuan, which was 0.035 yuan lower than the price of the previous week. Hankou Zha beans were sold for 300 bags on this street, priced at 3.4 yuan and 0.28 yuan. The future of the bean market depends on the trend after the market opens because Anhui's exemption from donations is brewing. On the previous day (Sunday), Sassoon Foreign Firm purchased 300 tons of sesame for 9.8 yuan, which was still quite brisk. Currently, the goods owners are quoting 10 yuan. In the afternoon, it was heard that Jardine Matheson had sent a telegram, and it may be possible to close a deal at this price, and the transaction volume will inevitably be considerable. Spot goods were purchased by a Japanese bank for 212 bags of Bengbu sesame for 6.6 yuan. 60 bags of Jiujiang milk sesame were priced at 6.77 yuan, and the market price also rose by 0.04 to 0.05 yuan.</p>
<h3>Canadian Wheat Stockpiles</h3>
<p>The Chicago grain market is slack, and Canadian wheat is stockpiled. Argentine, Australian, and French grains are shipped and sold everywhere, and current prices are difficult to raise. Today's market is supported by the lack of snow in the producing areas and the severe cold weather in the southwest.</p>

<h3>Tinplate Costly and Difficult to Sell Cheaply</h3>
<p>The tinplate market is costly and difficult to sell cheaply. Because the fixed price has soared and the foreign exchange is expensive, the cost has increased. Due to capital relationship, the industry colleagues refuse to sell cheaply, and in the tight credit period of the year, it is not easy to extend credit, so they are unwilling to sell. Most of them are prepared to sell again next spring, so there are very few shipments. The market conditions of various colors are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>British Goods: Out of stock for a long time, the market is quite lonely. Although the industry colleagues still have purchases for forward orders, distant water cannot quench the immediate thirst, so there is still no news to report in Shanghai.</p>
<p>American Goods: The transaction of the egg factory bank is not very developed, so the outlet has been sharply reduced. Although printing plants have some embellishments, the number is very small. Therefore, in terms of market conditions, it can still stand without falling, such as 90-pound single-layer estimated at 16.5 yuan, double-layer at 32.75 yuan, 100-pound single-layer at 17.25 yuan, and double-layer at 35 yuan. It is heard that there are only dozens of boxes of trading in recent days, and large transactions are still unheard of. However, the cost of new goods is very high, so the industry colleagues are unwilling to sell cheaply.</p>
<p>Italian Goods: The only thing popular in this market is double-layer, estimated at 31 yuan, and the relief market price is 31.5 yuan. The transactions of can factories and iron printing plants are particularly good, and the toy companies also have wide production transactions. In addition, customers only ask about the prices. German Goods: The transaction is quite good, and the goods that arrive are not widely available, so the holders have the intention of hoarding. The price is like 90 pounds single-layer estimated at 16 yuan, 100 pounds at 16.5 yuan, double-layer 100 pounds estimated at 33 yuan, 90 pounds estimated at 31.5 yuan. It is heard that only a few have been released in recent days.</p>
<p>French Goods: The transaction of the goods is quite good, but the nature is hard, so it is not suitable for exquisite printing and canning. Therefore, the transaction is only limited to rough and low-end goods. The current market price is 15.5 yuan (90 pounds) and 16 yuan (100 pounds). There are no double-layer goods, so there is no market to report.</p>

<h3>New Year's Writing Attempt</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shoujuan</p>
<p>Oh dear, another year! Today, they say, is New Year's Day, and it is appropriate to offer congratulations, which is called "New Year greetings." However, while people offer New Year greetings, I want to mourn the year!</p>
<p>Someone might say: The new year brings a new age, and all things are renewed. We should offer congratulations. Why mourn? Isn't that too unromantic?</p>
<p>I say: There is nothing to congratulate, but there is much to mourn. For me personally, my age increases year by year, and my vigor decreases year by year. Daily affairs become more complicated, burdens become heavier, opportunities become fewer, and death draws nearer. Moreover, things rarely go as I wish, and I have few people to confide in. I endure countless grievances alone. In such an environment, spending such years, even if the new year arrives, what is there to congratulate? I only feel it is something to mourn. As for society, disasters spread year by year, the people's livelihood declines year by year, thieves and robbers run rampant year by year, and order becomes more chaotic year by year. Moreover, the world is rugged, and people's hearts are treacherous. New morality has not yet been established, and old morality has long gone bankrupt. Although we loudly advocate reforming society, society remains unreformed. Even if the new year arrives, what is there to congratulate? I only feel it is something to mourn. As for the country, the national territory shrinks year by year, the national treasury becomes empty year by year, domestic affairs remain unreformed year by year, foreign affairs are handled inadequately year by year, and the country's international status declines year by year. In such a country, in such a world, even if the new year arrives, what is there to congratulate? I only feel it is something to mourn.</p>
<p>Alas! Wang Xiaoer's New Year gets worse year by year. Even if I force myself to smile and join in the New Year greetings, what meaning is there? Moreover, the Second World War is about to break out. In the great disaster to come, I don't know what will happen. The arrival of this twenty-fourth New Year is like the Buddha making a great lion's roar, warning us in the darkness, saying: "This is the eve of great world turmoil. An ancient country with thousands of years of history may collapse at any time, and striving for strength and prosperity is now or never. Are you prepared?"</p>
<p>Are you prepared? No one can offer an answer. Drawing my sword and striking the ground, the ground remains silent. Scratching my head and asking the sky, the sky is also silent.</p>
<h3>Little Predictions for the 24th Year</h3>
<p>— Fang'an</p>
<p>Time flies swiftly, and the year ends. Let the old debts be carried away by the east wind! Some predictions, I hope, will come true. A New Year's writing attempt, just to replace the red couplets.</p>
<p>The winter is not severely cold, and the rain and snow are well-distributed. No one will freeze to death on the roads, covering the vermillion gates with the stench of wine and meat to be given to the disaster victims. The river ice will freeze solid, and the rice borers' eggs in the fields will be frozen to death. In the spring and summer, the silkworm silk harvest will be bountiful, and the price will be surprisingly high. Hangzhou silk, Beijing satin, and Huzhou crepe will suddenly increase from several dimes per foot to more than three yuan. Farmers will benefit a little. In July, the epidemic will not spread, and the owner of the Drinking Ice Studio will make a fortune. In the autumn harvest, many double ears of grain will grow in the fields, and the farmers will smile so much that their eyes narrow.</p>
<p>The Fifth National Congress of Representatives will open in the capital, with unity from all sides in sincerity. Important figures will issue a declaration of unity, which will be selected as a textbook for all schools, immortal for thousands of years.</p>
<p>A reporter will win the first prize in the aviation ticket lottery and build tens of millions of houses to shelter the world's scholars.</p>
<p>The Tianzhu incense market will become even more lively. Dozens of scenic spots in various provinces will be discovered, greatly broadening the horizons of tourists. Someone exploring the Zilai Cave on the lake will discover that it can reach Huizhou, providing a shortcut to Anhui.</p>
<p>During the typhoon season, the thirty-three-story building in Shanghai will be unharmed.</p>
<p>The people of the country will revel in both the government and the public, spending the New Year of 1936 peacefully and securely.</p>
<h3>New Year's Musings</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>New Year's Day is the beginning of a year. Even amidst national hatred, family disasters, wind, and rain, people must still force a smile and celebrate with joy, doing everything possible to decorate and embellish. This is because everyone has hope and deeply desires that everything starts smoothly. However, hope is the same every year, and the results are always the same, merely showing the foolishness of dreams.</p>
<p>In Western customs, turkey is eaten on New Year's Day. The turkey is named for its brilliant brocade-like colors and is also called fire chicken. Westerners consulting a chef must ask if they know how to cook turkey, as it is considered the standard for judging skill.</p>
<p>Japanese women style their hair on New Year's Day, calling it the "first hair." Seru has a poem about it, saying: "Thousands of heavenly maidens compete in gorgeous hair, the palm of the hand holds a new cloud with a moon halo, and she is busy by the mirror, annoyed that the maiden is busy combing her hair." Also, dreams between New Year's Day and the second day are called "first dreams." On the night of the first dream, people buy a picture of the Seven Lucky Gods' Treasure Ship to place under their pillow, praying for a lucky dream. Seru also has a poem about it, saying: "Red rouge dampens the Treasure Ship picture, seven divine sails, a watercolor charm, waking up and smoothing my hair, I smile first, and ask my love if he saw me in his first dream."</p>
<p>Painting Zhong Kui is a Dragon Boat Festival story, but originally it was done on New Year's Day. The "Idle Glimpses of Duncai" says: "Today, people paint Zhong Kui at the beginning of the year to ward off evil spirits, a custom said to have started during the reign of Emperor Ming of Tang." "Seven Repair Class Drafts" also records that Shen Mingde's New Year's Day poem says: "The newly mounted Zhong Kui is hung first, the bright red spring couplets are gilded." Taoist books also call New Year's Day the "Central Heaven Festival," which is the same as the Dragon Boat Festival.</p>
<p>Drinking Tusu wine on New Year's Day is an old custom, and traditionally the youngest should drink first, hence Gu Kuang's poem: "Holding the Tusu, let the young ones drink first." In fact, Tusu is the name of a plant. Painting this plant on the house is how the house got its name. In the past, people lived in Tusu houses to brew wine, so it was called Tusu wine, said to ward off improper influences. According to elders, when the Manchus entered the Pass and engaged in wanton slaughter, people in Suzhou, having seen the horrors of Yangzhou and Jiading, mutually agreed to abolish the custom of drinking Tusu wine on New Year's Day, as the character "屠" (tu, slaughter) was considered unlucky, fearing it would bring disaster to the living. It is also pitiable.</p>
<h3>Do Not Lightly Let New Year's Day Pass</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>Today is New Year's Day of the 24th year of the Republic of China. The plan for the year lies in the spring. The start of the year's great undertakings should naturally begin on New Year's Day, so we should not lightly let New Year's Day pass.</p>
<p>In the past year, our China has been mired in a whole year of natural disasters of floods and droughts, man-made disasters of banditry and unrest, the attacks of foreign powers by aircraft and warships, and the severe oppression of economic aggression. It has been almost impossible to breathe freely. But this unfortunate 23rd year has passed with the passage of time. The bright New Year's Day of the 24th year has broken through the long night and descended upon us. Naturally, what we hope for is that the light and good fortune of the 24th year will also, along with New Year's Day, break through the terrible atmosphere of the 23rd year and descend upon us.</p>
<p>But light and good fortune require people to strive to pursue them. Light and good fortune will not descend naturally like New Year's Day. This point must be clearly understood. The reason why the 23rd year fell into such a dense and terrible atmosphere was not as natural as the decline of the 23rd year. The reason was the mistake in direction. Lying before us, no matter what it is, there are always two roads: one is successful, and the other is a failure. The 23rd year mistakenly embarked on the path of failure. But which path should we take this year?</p>
<p>Today is New Year's Day. Today is the beginning of this year's great undertakings. On this day, we naturally hope that this year will be full of light and full of good fortune. Light and good fortune are spread all over the path of success that lies before us. We only need to be able to clearly recognize our direction at the beginning of this year's great undertakings, to clearly recognize our first step, and to decide which path to take. Should we follow the direction of last year and continue down the path of failure, or should we change direction and take the path to success?</p>
<p>Today is New Year's Day of the 20th year of the Republic of China, how important it is that we do not let it lightly slip away!</p>
<h3>Wang Xiaoer's Confession</h3>
<p>— Liang</p>
<p>"Crack," here, "crack," there, the women are dressed in bright red and green, attracting attention. The men are also dressed up very nicely, with a smiling expression on their faces. Cars and rickshaws, squeezing out ear-piercing horns, honking, the streets are really more lively than usual, it's the New Year. A group of children madly dart out of the alley, "Whirr, whirr..." Who knows what they're shouting? "Crack, crack," throwing firecrackers.</p>
<p>Wang Xiaoer has no such interest, with such an ashen face, less than half an inch of cigarette butt still stuck to his purple lip, carrying a bit of knife-cut meat in his hand, "It's the New Year," he thought in his heart, look at the happy feasts of others, but alas, I am always struggling in poverty, with no comfortable days to live, "Is there really fate and destiny?" He often asked himself angrily. He walked along the curb, so slowly, like a snail crawling, but suddenly "Crack," a firecracker exploded on his head, and he was startled. Turning his head, "Hahaha..." A group of children darted into the alley.</p>
<p>"Damn it, even the kids want to bully Wang Xiaoer, people just can't be poor." He cursed a few times, but no one sympathized with him, and others "hahaha" ran away laughing. He thought, "Dogs look down on people," and in a fit of anger, even his eyes blurred. He stumbled home, squeezed through the broken gate, ignored everyone, and collapsed on the bed.</p>
<p>Then he thought and thought: "What is fate? What is destiny? It's all useless talk. Didn't I, Wang Xiaoer, live a good life before? A big family, but the brothers insisted on dividing the family, not harmonious, fighting and grabbing. It benefited outsiders and neighbors, stealing and grabbing, and at that time they only knew to fight among themselves, and didn't care when others came to rob them. Lawsuits, one year, two years... dragging on, all the property is gone, and what's the point of saying 'fighting for honor, not wealth,' brothers... Thinking about it, it hurts..." Wang Xiaoer shed tears, he regretted the mistakes of the past, and resolved to reconcile with his brothers again, and start working together.</p>
<p>On this New Year's night, Wang Xiaoer's wife cooked a big bowl of knife-cut meat, and two pieces of salted fish. Wang Xiaoer bought a pound of white liquor, and drank and ate with his eldest brother, little third, and little fourth. They all threw away their old grudges and spoke from the heart. When they were happy, they "burst" out laughing.</p>
<h3>Last Page of the Calendar...</h3>
<p>— Qingqu</p>
<p>Alas! Time truly passes quickly! A year of three hundred and sixty-five days has fleetingly reached its last day; recalling the past time, it is like flowing water that never returns. A predecessor said: "Those that abandon me, yesterday's days cannot be retained; those that disturb my heart, today's days bring much worry." Reciting these old sayings, one cannot help but think about why time rushes people, and how fast it is. A perfectly round Earth constantly revolves around the sun, and no one has ever stopped the north-south axis of the Earth; therefore, the course of human life follows the time of seconds, minutes, and moments, passing by in an instant, almost in the blink of an eye, and another year has reached its last day.</p>
<p>I take a look at the calendar of the 23rd year of the Republic of China. Wasn't it quite thick when it was hanging on the wall at first? Unexpectedly, today I tear off one sheet, and tomorrow I tear off another sheet, and now it's December 31st. In my heart, I think, if this sheet is torn off again, will there be a head below it! Everyone knows that the days of the 23rd year are over. But the last page of this calendar, is it better to tear it off, or to leave it behind? I hesitate quite a bit. Because this sheet, even if torn off, will be replaced by next year's calendar, but "the year is not the year of the past, the day is not the day of last year," how can I not stare straight at the wall, lingering and reluctant to tear it off, stand it up, solemnly choose a vacant place, re-hang it, and write a few words on it: "You calendar of the 23rd year, you gave us time for meaningful activity, but many, regrettably, people are unwilling to cherish it, and constantly waste it, then: it is like a shuttle passing by and being missed. It is not the calendar that is ungrateful to people, but rather people who are ungrateful to the calendar, so I am ashamed of you, how can I harden my heart and tear you off again?"</p>
<h3>New Year's Day Celebration in Disaster Areas</h3>
<p>— Yiqian</p>
<h3>Talking About New Year's Cards</h3>
<p>— Chen Tuigan</p>
<p>The giant wheel of time is constantly moving forward, and New Year's Day of the 24th year of the Republic of China has arrived again. Regardless of the drastic changes in the international situation and the increasing poverty of the rural areas in the interior, people who value etiquette in society always congratulate each other during the New Year. Thus, peach-colored and rose-purple New Year's cards are bundled and tied up and stuffed into every household by green-uniformed postmen. Speaking of New Year's cards, several years ago, a certain newspaper supplement published that a Mr. Wu of Wujin collected more than a hundred kinds of New Year's cards and held a public exhibition in the local people's education hall. The colorfulness was quite a spectacle. In recent years, I have seen in a friend's house that some people sent him several New Year's cards with the words "Sincere Unity, Strive to Save the Country" printed on them. To say that he is seeking novelty and uniqueness is a bit of a violation of conscience. Because communication between friends is the effect of emotion, then why not reveal the enthusiasm of Du Fu's concern for the times and the country to friends on New Year's cards?</p>
<p>This year's New Year's cards have not yet been seen in many kinds, but I imagine that there will definitely be more timely New Year's cards discovered, because the characteristics of the Chinese nation have always been able to adapt to the environment.</p>
<h3>Is Possible</h3>
<p>— Yaguang</p>
<h3>Musings on the Pig</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>Thoughts on the Year of the Pig</p>
<p>As the old saying goes, "When a bird is about to die, its cry is mournful; when a person is about to die, their words are good." The stupid and lowly pig, usually eating its fill and sleeping greedily, with no intention, will also cry mournfully when facing execution!</p>
<p>When I was about fourteen or fifteen years old, one early morning, I carried my schoolbag to school and passed by a pig farm. I saw a butcher with a hideous appearance, holding a gleaming sharp knife, aiming at the white tip of a pig hanging from a beam, going in with the red tip coming out, the sound was tragic! Blood was flowing continuously! At that time, I thought to myself: a big-bellied, leisurely, and lowly animal! It also has a day of doom! But it doesn't feel what the future of China is like? Since the sounds of the cannons of September 18th and January 28th successively started, I realized that the enemy was taking us as piglets! Without any politeness, they are slaughtering us with knife after knife, but the Chinese people are still living in a drunken dream, and even the tragic cries like those of pigs cannot be heard at all!</p>
<p>Time flies quickly! The Chinese Republic, with its hundred holes and thousands of sores, has reached twenty-four years old! New Year's Day meets the Year of the Pig. If you are not a cold-blooded animal, who would not be chilled! Who would not be startled! Meaningless prayers are not as good as everyone rising up and making a self-defense movement for the struggle of national life! Strive for the final preparations! To deal with the imminent disaster! This is what I encourage myself and others with.</p>
<h3>New Year's Day of the 24th Year of the Republic of China—Hoping for a Change in National Fortune</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiping</p>
<p>"Writing red on New Year's Day, everything goes smoothly!" This old saying is deeply imprinted in the minds of ordinary people, so no matter the old or new society, on New Year's Day, there are always many superstitious people who, when they meet, say a few "auspicious words." We reporters, every New Year's Day, must have a special issue, publishing a few articles celebrating the whole world, wishing the country's fortune to be prosperous and the people's livelihood to be blessed. But a year passes easily, and it is the New Year again. If you compare these words with reality, they are simply deceiving people, and you feel ashamed yourself! So, from now on, on New Year's Day, I dare not speak big words or harbor extravagant hopes.</p>
<p>For pessimists, when they open the first page of the new calendar of the 24th year, they may be frightened and worried, how will the country's fortune change this year? How will the people's livelihood be bitter or happy? In addition, the world situation is dangerous, and a great war is inevitable. Looking forward to the future, there is more bad luck than good luck! For optimists, knowing that disaster is at hand and the end is not far away, but if everyone has this mentality, they will inevitably accomplish nothing. Instead of sitting and sighing, it is better to roll up your sleeves and take action. My majestic China, the fragmented situation in the past twenty-three years, is indeed unbearable to look back on. Is it possible that the country's fortune will be in a slump from now on? No, absolutely not! I believe that after the 24th year, there will be hope for a change in the country's fortune. Look! The leaders of the central government and various provinces all have an enterprising spirit and a spirit of hard work. Leaders from all sides already have a trend of implementing great unity. The sage said, "In the way of the former kings, harmony is the most valuable." If we can truly have a great and thorough understanding and work together in harmony, it will be an omen of a change in the country's fortune. As for the promotion of education, industry, transportation, water conservancy, land reclamation, and the New Life Movement to restore inherent morality in various provinces, they are all being carried forward and amplified. Isn't this clear evidence?</p>
<p>The people of the whole country have suffered enough in the past, and it is useless to be discouraged, it is useless to be angry, and it is even more useless to blame the heavens and hate the earth; from now on, we must recognize the goal, strive to lift ourselves up, solve our own problems, and serve the society and the country. With unity from top to bottom, we will revive China. Ming Confucian Lu Xinwu said: "Life begins in poverty, followed by repentance and striving, then from repentance and striving, one learns diligence and hardship, from diligence and hardship, one knows thrift and frugality, from thrift and frugality, one can accumulate savings, and from savings, one gradually becomes wealthy. After wealth, pride and complacency arise, one becomes accustomed to extravagance, indulges in lewdness and violence, and will inevitably bring about disaster and return to poverty." Now the situation of my Chinese nation is after poverty, we must repent and strive and be diligent, and combine the strength of 450 million people to change the country's fortune!</p>
<h3>New Year's Greetings—Yan Chonglou</h3>
<p>Life should be about gaining new experiences in constant activity; life should be about creating new life in the rotating sequence of time.</p>
<p>Now, 1934 has passed away, and 1935 has come to our eyes again; this New Year brings us a new scene, a new kind of excitement.</p>
<p>Look! Isn't the spring breeze blowing gently? Isn't the sprouting beginning to grow? Aren't the birds singing happily on the branches?... Although we have suffered a lot of trials and tribulations in the past, and tasted a lot of pain,... but now this new sequence of time has added new hope to us; it has healed the old scars on our hearts.</p>
<p>The wheels of the times are advancing, and the value of life is increasing. We must recognize the meaning of the New Year, strive to create new life, and stride forward on the new avenue.</p>
<p>"May the whole world become a new world; may all mankind become a new mankind." I will take these two sentences as New Year's greetings.</p>
<h3>The "Imperial Incense缥缈录" outer collection from Mr. Xunling, who was specially allowed to wear glasses by the Empress Dowager Cixi, about Empress Longyu and Consort Jin</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>In the "Introduction to the Original Author" chapter of my translation of 御香縹緲錄, as well as in the middle of the main text, Mr. Xunling's name has been seen several times, and readers should not be very unfamiliar with him! Recently, through the introduction of my old friend Tang Yunfan, I was able to meet him in person and talked a lot with him. Therefore, I learned that he himself was a French-trained engineering student who once worked as the electrical plant supervisor in the Qing Palace and often took photos for Cixi in his spare time. His eyes were nearsighted, and he wore glasses very early. After returning to China, he saw the Empress Dowager for the first time, and the Empress Dowager asked: "Xunling, isn't there something wrong with your eyes?" He replied: "Yes, I am nearsighted"! The Empress Dowager asked again: "Do you wear glasses?" He replied: "Yes"! The Empress Dowager then said: "Then put them on"! In this way, his wearing glasses was considered a special favor! Whenever he had an audience, he no longer took them off; therefore, the passage in Imperial Incense 缥缈录 where Deling describes his glasses is all true!</p>
<p>Mr. Xunling also told me a few anecdotes about Guangxu's wife, Empress Longyu, and his concubine, Consort Jin, which were very interesting. I am writing them on New Year's Day to make readers laugh.</p>
<p>(1) Longyu Suffered from Bad Breath. According to our imagination, an empress should be very beautiful, but Longyu's appearance was actually very ordinary, and she suffered from severe bad breath. Therefore, she had to constantly smoke cigarettes, trying to cover it up a bit. However, she still could not fully be considerate, and often liked to give the cigarette butts she had smoked to the noble ladies, princesses, district princesses, or palace maids who entered and left the palace. Those who received them were not able to refuse, so they had to try their best to endure it, or quickly rinse their mouths, or throw them away as soon as she could not see them.</p>
<p>(2) Consort Jin's Nickname was Gilded Chamber Pot. According to our imagination, the emperor's concubine should be a charming beauty, but Consort Jin was just the opposite, so ugly that it was indescribable. Her figure was both short and fat. People in the palace secretly gave her a nickname, called gilded chamber pot, which can be said to be unkind! However, Guangxu was indeed not bad to her, which was purely because of her blood sister, Consort Zhen. Consort Zhen, it is said, was indeed a very beautiful woman, but unfortunately, she died too early!</p>

<p>Shanghai Girls' Middle School Fourth Anniversary Special Issue of Morality and Art</p>
<h3>Foreword</h3>
<p>— Lin Kanghou</p>
<p>The vast Pacific Ocean, the fierce waves are rushing, what time is it today. Sharks compete for the continent—what is the continent? It is the Chinese nation. Therefore, insightful people work hard on education—in the principles of education, there are actually many items listed: first Ke loves what he loves, and Zi likes what he likes. ...</p>
<p>My Chinese nation, with a population of 400 million, and among the 400 million, women account for half. Unfortunately, after the three seasons, they have become accustomed to customs and habits, spending their entire lives in seclusion, rarely seeing the faces of living people. Alas, women's bodies are willing to be played by men. Between the importance of men and women, a clear distinction is made from now on!</p>
<p>The ancestors had a warning: "Lack of talent is virtue." Ban Zhao wrote "Lessons for Women," and Duke Zhou wrote "Internal Rules." Women's models and rituals are discussed in detail, entering only to manage the dustpan and broom, and going out must be elaborately dressed; ... Song Confucianists were too busy, concerned about losing their chastity. From then on, women's bodies no longer had the light of day!</p>
<p>When Qing was coming to an end, all doors were opened, and the fruits of Western equality came to China. By the time we entered the Republic of China, what a majestic atmosphere. In major cities, girls' schools are densely arranged. Although we cannot catch up head-on, we are eager to catch up straight away. Girls' schools at this time are shining in five colors.</p>
<p>My school has been established for only four years. After several years of difficult management, we have finally achieved a satisfactory result. However, it is difficult to succeed, and it is almost certain to know the difficulty. The upper and lower levels must be of one mind, and the inside and outside must be one body. If we can be diligent, if we can abide by the principles, if we do not succeed, pluck out my eyes.</p>
<p>All female students, the most important thing is cultivation: in ordinary times, you must be quiet and idle, and be careful of drifting away in times of trouble. Studying should be diligent. Put an end to the thought of seeking luck, do not hold a hoof and wish for a full harvest; clothing should be simple, and take what is suitable for concealing the ugly. Do not apply powder and rouge, and act like a spoiled model.</p>
<p>My school is in its infancy, and the period is like a transition. In the past, we faced Wen Chao Street, but now we have moved to Xieqiao Road. In the past, when it was established, there were only a hundred students, and now it is considerable, increasing by ten or five times. We are grateful to the people of society for their praise. To plan for permanent ease, we will think about building from now on. From now on, we will think about what kind of building to build. In the quiet place of South Shanghai, purchase more than a hundred acres of land. In the future, we will close it as a school, and strive for large-scale. The square must be vast, and the houses must be spacious. There are rooms for experiments, and there are libraries for books... Although we cannot do it now, we will show our plans in the future. I am ashamed to be in the ranks, and this is difficult to shirk. I will write a few lines of ink for now to express my sincere heart.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Girls' Middle School Fourth Anniversary of Cultivating Virtue and Art</h3>
<p>— Inscribed by Lin Sen</p>
<h3>Talking About Girl-Centered Education</h3>
<p>— Ou Yuanhuai</p>
<p>Shanghai Girls' Middle School is scheduled to hold a school anniversary celebration on New Year's Day of the 24th year of the Republic of China, and a letter was sent to me, borrowing it to encourage the celebration. The reason is that the school has only been established for four years, and those in charge of school affairs have worked hard and managed it with difficulty. Today, it has become a very successful educational institution in Shanghai. I would like to take this opportunity to share my humble opinion with the people of the country on the issue of female education.</p>
<p>In the past, the general society in our country had an unreasonable view of women. The so-called lack of talent in women is virtue, the so-called three obediences and four virtues, this kind of patriarchal thinking has bound Chinese women for thousands of years. Therefore, the movement for gender equality is an inevitable trend in our country to adapt to the times. However, if we want to achieve gender equality, we must first raise the knowledge of women, and women's education will flourish.</p>
<p>However, our country has advocated the establishment of women's education for thirty or forty years. In the process of this new movement, on the one hand, there has been a lot of progress, and at the same time, many mistakes have been discovered. Girls' schools at all levels often only stick to the principle of gender equality in education, and are ignorant of the differences in male and female physiology and needs. They only focus on cultivating social people, and ignore the cultivation of family people. As a result, the disadvantages have caused many new-style women to only know how to consume, disdain to work, and cannot serve the society when they enter, and cannot manage family affairs when they retreat. The impact on the collapse of family organization and the crisis of the country and society may be more than we can say.</p>
<p>In the society of the 20th century, gender equality is generally recognized by the world, and equal educational opportunities are also stipulated by the constitution. However, so-called gender equality does not mean that whatever men do, women must also do. As for equal educational opportunities for men and women, it refers to equal opportunities for education in law, but in the content of educational facilities, there should still be different adaptations to characteristics. In other words, women should have women's education, which is also called girl-centered education. This new trend in education must be able to develop women's own femininity and women's common motherhood. The common humanity of mankind, in the family, must be a virtuous hostess, in the society, must be a productive member, and in the country, must be a sound citizen.</p>
<p>Based on the above, the facilities of girls' schools in the future, whether in terms of curriculum, teaching materials, equipment, or training, should not be completely given "masculinized" education, and special consideration should be given to the various situations of women's physiology, psychology, and society. Must focus on family economics, infant care, child education, hygiene principles and practices, and sex education guidance, etc., in order to maintain their natural talents, spiritual qualities, and special interests and emotions, and be able to cultivate a new era of independent and self-conscious women, who can serve the society externally and maintain the family internally, which we are happy to see. And the future of the country really depends on it.</p>
<h3>For the Shanghai Girls' Middle School in the Past Four Years, Cultivate Virtue and Study</h3>
<p>— Inscribed by Jiang Zhongzheng</p>
<h3>The Past of Our School</h3>
<p>— Wu Zhiqian</p>
<p>Education is the foundation of a country. The prosperity and decline of a nation and the strength and weakness of a country depend on the transfer of its culture. The countries of Europe and the United States, with their advanced academics and pioneering science, look down on the universe and are rich and powerful. Observers attribute this to the popularity of education. Our country has been weak for a long time, and the national power is declining. Revitalizing and strengthening depends on the development of education and the construction of the national economy. The transformation of the country depends on the transfer of the people's wisdom. My country has a population of 400 million, and women account for half of it. Therefore, the education problem and the career problem of women must be solved. This is the reason why I founded Shanghai Girls' Middle School.</p>
<p>In the spring of the 20th year of the Republic of China, I gathered comrades and raised funds. Then, I rented No. 19 Xuexi Street, Wenmiao Road, Ximen as a school building, and hired Mr. Lin Kanghou, Chu Minyi, Wu Tiecheng, Wu Xingya, and Tao Baichuan as school managers. I published an advertisement in the newspaper on January 22 to recruit students, held the first entrance examination on February 9, and officially started classes on the 14th. From then on, our school officially met with the public.</p>
<p>In the autumn of the 20th year, the number of students increased sharply, and the original school building was not enough for use. Therefore, I rented Jialu, Menghua Street as an off-campus dormitory and completely transformed the original school building into classrooms. As for the subjects, it is divided into four departments: high school, junior high school, kindergarten normal school, and adult remedial class. I thought that the foundation of the school was already in place, and from then on, it would be able to proceed smoothly, not remembering that not long after the start of classes, the disaster of "September 18" occurred. The bad news came, and the whole country was angry. The teachers and students of our school embraced the motto of "reading and not forgetting to save the country, saving the country and not forgetting to study," and rose up to organize an anti-Japanese association to advocate for all schools; they also organized a propaganda team to go to places such as Su and Xi to publicize, awaken the people, and jointly go to the national crisis. Looking back on this semester, the minds of all the teachers and students of the school were occupied by the work of resisting Japan and saving the country.</p>
<p>In the 21st year, our school was about to endure the pain of starting classes, but the "January 28" Songhu Incident occurred again. Therefore, the students were scattered, and the impact on our school was indeed great. In the autumn of that year, due to the impact of the war, the high school department was temporarily suspended; a simple normal department and a Chinese-English typing department were added to meet social needs.</p>
<p>After the start of the spring semester of the 22nd year, school affairs developed, and the original school building was too narrow. Therefore, two large houses on Xieqiao Manufacturing Bureau Road were rented as school buildings, which is also the current school building of our school. In the autumn of that year, the high school department was restored, divided into ordinary vocational departments; and the Hunan Guild Hall was rented as a sports field. Since this year, the foundation of the school has become more and more consolidated. Now, in total, there are high school, junior high school, vocational department, normal department, typing department, remedial department, and affiliated elementary schools and kindergartens such as Dalu, Daguang, Zhenhua, and Tianhua. There are more than 800 students and more than 50 faculty members.</p>
<p>Although our school has only been founded for four years, the foundation of the school has been laid. Tracing back to the source, although it can be said to be the efforts of our school colleagues, it is also due to the support and assistance of people from the society. In the future, we will continue to work hard in accordance with our original intention. We hope that the people of the country will rise up and teach us!</p>
<h3>Shanghai Girls' Middle School's Progress in Virtue and Scholarship over the Past Four Years</h3>
<p>— Wang Zhaoming</p>
<h3>The Current Situation of Our School</h3>
<p>— Lu Zhongkui</p>
<p>It has been four years since the establishment of our school. Through hardships and difficulties, and with painstaking management, the teachers and students of the whole school have worked together to develop the school affairs to the scale of today. The actual situation has been described in detail by Principal Wu Zhiqian as above. Since I have been serving as the teaching director of our school, and I have been doing my best for two years, on the occasion of the fourth anniversary of our school, I would like to briefly describe the current situation in points, and report it to the people of the society. I hope that you will point out any omissions:</p>
<p>1. Organization Our school takes the board of directors as the establishment body. The school administration is fully managed by the principal, and the secretary assists the principal in handling school affairs. School affairs are divided into two departments: general affairs and teaching, each with several sections to handle daily school affairs. In addition, various committees are set up to manage the affairs related to each committee.</p>
<p>2. Meetings Our school handles school affairs on the principle of rationalization. In order to gather wisdom and benefit from each other, the handling of various school affairs must be submitted to the meeting for public decision. The school affairs meeting is the highest administrative meeting of our school, and it is organized by the directors of various departments and affiliated institutions and representatives of faculty members, with the principal as the chairman. It is held once every two weeks, with general affairs and teaching meetings set up below, with the directors of each department as the chairman, and held once every four weeks. There is also a general meeting of all faculty members, held separately at the beginning and end of each semester. The life guidance committee is organized by the class teachers of each grade, and it is held once every four weeks.</p>
<p>3. Rules and Regulations In order to achieve division of labor and cooperation, and to have each position have its own responsibilities, our school has certain rules and regulations for administrative processing and student activities. The more important ones include organizational outlines, faculty service regulations, temporary faculty treatment regulations, school affairs, general affairs, teaching, and various student rules, etc.</p>
<p>4. School Buildings The current school buildings of our school are all rented. There are two large buildings in the middle school department, covering an area of six mu. There are more than one hundred and twenty rooms of various sizes.</p>
<p>5. Equipment Due to limited economy, the equipment of our school is simple. There are now offices, reception rooms, auditoriums, ordinary classrooms, special classrooms, libraries, physics and chemistry instrument rooms, conference rooms, entertainment rooms, student dormitories, dining halls, and faculty dormitories, which are sufficient for application. In addition to ancient books and the first and second collections of the newly revised Wan You Wen Ku, there are more than 5,000 books. There are more than 1,000 pieces of physics and chemistry instruments, specimens, and hanging pictures, worth more than 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>6. Faculty In this semester, there are a total of 23 faculty members in the middle school department of our school. Two-thirds of them are excellent, and more than three-quarters of them are full-time. Two-thirds of the graduates of universities and specialized schools are also strong, and the appointment is based on specialized subjects. Female teachers account for more than one-third of the total.</p>
<p>7. Students In this semester, there are more than 800 students in the junior high school spring and autumn grades, the high school ordinary vocational departments, the simple normal department (which is being closed), the typing department, the remedial department, and the affiliated elementary school.</p>
<p>8. Curriculum The curriculum of our school is in accordance with the curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry of Education, and it is modified according to the actual situation, with Chinese, English, and mathematics as the main subjects, and special emphasis is added.</p>
<p>9. Teaching Materials The teaching materials for each subject in this semester are all based on the curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry, and the latest and best teaching books on the market are selected, or they are compiled by the teachers in charge of each subject.</p>
<p>10. Teaching Our school's teaching adopts strict doctrine. Academic and moral behavior achievements are practically examined on time. Entry and exit, correspondence, meetings, telephone calls, and requests for resignations are all managed. Dormitories are checked early and late, absences are strictly handled, student group activities are guided, school life is enriched, educational movies are opened, field trips are held, academic research is encouraged, and the New Life Movement is promoted, in order to achieve the balanced development of morality, intelligence, physique, and beauty.</p>

<h3>At the beginning of the birth of the people, education was the most important era. The progress of women's precepts and the essential qualities of good mothers and virtuous wives are treasures of history. From now on, seeking the revival of the nation and the improvement of people depends on the cultivation of girls' schools.</h3>
<p>— Inscribed by Ju Zheng in the winter of the 23rd year of the Republic of China</p>
<h3>The Future of Our School</h3>
<p>— Zheng Tiejian</p>
<p>Our school was established four years ago. We have been planning painstakingly and managing diligently. Today, it has taken initial shape. Looking back, with extremely limited financial resources and a short period of time, the fact that we have achieved today's results is primarily due to Mr. Wu's efforts. Observing the current situation, the school's development is now a thousand times greater than in the past. However, we colleagues are unwilling to be complacent and will continue to uphold our original aspirations and strive forward. This is what we sincerely want to tell the ladies and gentlemen of society. On the occasion of our fourth anniversary, I would like to elaborate on the school's future plans as follows:</p>
<p>I. Material Construction</p>
<p>Material construction requires sufficient financial resources. Once the economy is sufficient, large school buildings, spacious campuses, sports fields, classrooms, libraries, and science laboratories can be completed in succession. In order to realize the Shanghai Girls' High School in its plan, our school specifically purchased land in Caohejing this summer for the construction of a new school building. At the same time, we established a school development committee to raise huge funds and implement a five-year plan. All future facilities of our school will be based on this plan and will be carried out diligently to achieve a good educational environment.</p>
<p>II. Non-Material Construction</p>
<p>An excellent school must develop equally in quality and quantity. Quantity is only the form of the school, while quality is the spirit of the school. The future facilities of our school must seek a balance between the two. The so-called non-material construction includes the following:</p>
<p>(1) Teachers: Hire teachers with noble character and outstanding academic ability to teach various courses and instruct students.</p>
<p>(2) Curriculum: In addition to focusing on the three basic subjects of Chinese, English, and mathematics, we will also strive to enrich and perfect other subjects such as natural sciences, social sciences, hygiene, and arts.</p>
<p>(3) Student Training:</p>
<p>(1) Healthy Physique: Establish sports fields, promote healthy entertainment, pay attention to daily life and diet, exercise their bodies, and cultivate hardworking, resilient, energetic, and physically and mentally strong citizens.</p>
<p>(2) Enterprising Spirit: Change students' decadent and negative outlook on life to a positive, courageous, and enterprising spirit. Not only must they have the integrity not to do evil, but they must also have the intelligence to do good, so that they can shoulder the heavy responsibility of transforming society.</p>
<p>(3) Scientific Ability: Cultivate a scientific mind, treat people and handle affairs with a scientific attitude, be organized, increase work efficiency, and encourage students to study science and make scientific explorations and inventions.</p>
<p>The above are the fundamental guidelines for the future facilities of our school. We know that this work is arduous and difficult, but "where there is a will, there is a way." Our colleagues will work hard with an indomitable spirit to achieve it.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Girls' High School has excellent management and teaching, promoting Chinese culture and emphasizing practical learning, cultivating talents and exuding fragrance, the teaching staff has its own source, and the virtue of women is greatly demonstrated. Four years of operation have resulted in a complete scale, and collective wisdom and efforts are making progress day by day.</h3>

<h3>New Year's Day</h3>
<p>— Xiang Yu</p>
<p>The "edge of the clothes" of the past year still remains in our eyes.</p>
<p>We sighed a long sigh of relief. Good or bad, we have spent another year. Disappointment is falling behind, and hope is running ahead. Readers, if well-intentioned blessings are not rejected because we are in the same state of sorrow, let us, on the first day of this new year, temporarily cut off the sorrowful time we experienced in the past year and the unpleasant events associated with it, and let us open our arms to welcome this new year and its associated hopeful future. Of course, we cannot erase the facts and close our eyes and say that our suffering has gone with the past year, and our bright future has come with the coming year. People who say such things vaguely are either deliberately deceiving people or are following the old example of saying auspicious words such as "Congratulations and get rich" to make the listener happy. The fact is that no matter how auspicious words are said, how many are said, or how pleasant they are, they are not of much use to reality. (People who like to hear auspicious words have a different psychology and should be treated separately.) The objective situation will never change because a few auspicious words are said. We know that in such an economic downturn, we don't know how many people are on the hunger line, we don't know how many people are on the death line, we don't know how many people are throwing themselves into the Huangpu River, we don't know how many people are unemployed, we don't know how many shops are preparing to shrink, and we don't know how many shops are preparing to close. Even if auspicious words are willing to be said, who will listen? Undoubtedly, auspicious words, although not superfluous, are meaningless. Therefore, the so-called "happy new year" is actually unhappy.</p>
<p>Therefore, the arrival of the new year is like a stranger, an unwelcome guest, an unfortunate fate for most people, who do not want it to come, but have to let it come. Everyone has to step forward and experience it. The course of time cannot be exceeded or stayed, but the personnel in the evolution associated with time are somewhat controlled by ourselves. The imperfection of personnel is not the fault of others, but our own lack of effort. The center of the problem lies here. Should we face the problem head-on and work hard to untie the knot of the problem? Or should we retreat to the side of the cemetery and sing a decadent song? A lone boat in a rushing current on a stormy night can only move forward and not retreat. If it moves forward, the harbor may be in front of it. If it retreats, there is nowhere to stand and wait. In the course of life, there is only survival and death, and there is absolutely no bargaining. So it is with organisms, and so it is with superorganisms—society—toward survival—forward; toward death—backward. This is the New Year's example, and it is also the words we encourage each other with.</p>
<h3>New Year</h3>
<p>— Zang Kejia</p>
<p>Some time ago, I passed by a small alley, and a pair of door couplets evoked freshness in my eyes. As time passed, I no longer kept this in mind. As the New Year approaches, my heart is touched, and the pair of door couplets floats before my eyes again.</p>
<p>"The new year is not new,</p>
<p>The old year is not old."</p>
<p>You will find it ridiculous when you see it, right? However, after laughing, can you find some meaning in it?</p>
<p>Since China adopted the Gregorian calendar, there have been two years standing opposite each other. The new year gives the new people in the city excitement, while the old year still gives the old people in the countryside freshness.</p>
<p>If you say that the new year is indeed new, I cannot refute it, because every time we celebrate the new year, the atmosphere in the city is indeed different from usual. Every household hangs the flag of the blue sky and white sun, government officials hold New Year gatherings, and schools and shops can also be freed for three days. The happiness of a series of gongs and drums and a few tables of banquets come together. The authorities announce new plans, and various professional groups also set a new plan, as if after the new year, everything is really renewed and changed into a new life.</p>
<p>However, in other aspects, poor people in the countryside after bankruptcy are really afraid to say that they are celebrating the new year. When the new year comes, not to mention starving in the depths of spring, in their hearts it seems that every year is worse than the last. This is not superstition at work, but the lessons of reality.</p>
<p>The person who created the phrase "The new year is not new" must have the same feeling as me, right?</p>
<h3>New Year's Nonsense</h3>
<p>— Wei Zhongtian</p>
<p>My life has really become too bad this year. I myself sometimes can't believe why it has become so bad. Since I don't understand, if there is really such a thing as "fate" in the world, then I have to ask "fate" to understand.</p>
<p>When I celebrated the New Year last year, I was in ×× place. It wasn't happy or sad. I ate chicken and braised pork, and on that day I also saw a friend spit out a lot of bright red blood! This friend was spitting blood because of unemployment. A healthy person can also spit blood. This gave me a very deep impression. Not long after, I spent an old New Year in Guangzhou. At this time, because I had just escaped from the disaster, I felt a little happy—I only lived in Guangzhou for a week, and the great wind of life blew me to a city in the west again. I lived in pain and boredom for a few months. Although I only lived there for a few short months, that city gave me a lot of memories. These memories are naturally all painful! It was also at this time that I was shot in the heart by an enemy's arrow, and I almost wanted to leave this world for a short time. Even now, this scar still hurts.</p>
<p>Finally, in August, I decided to leave that painful city and flowed to Shanghai with a broken heart. I haven't seen Shanghai for a year, and I think it's a little thinner. I thought to myself: Shanghai, what extent will you be thin in ten years?</p>
<p>I only lived in Shanghai for more than a month, and I left it again. This time I left Shanghai was very accidental, and I left Shanghai with hope and a new heart. From this time on, I rebuilt my self-confidence and felt that I was still young. If I could work hard, the future would not be hopeless!</p>
<p>And now it's New Year again. The days are as fast as shooting arrows and as fast as lightning. Another year has passed quietly. What have I gained this year? Nothing at all. What I have is still the same disappointment.</p>
<p>This year's New Year is spent in Tokyo. This is the first time to spend the New Year in a foreign country. Of course, I have to wear a smile. Where will I spend the New Year next year? If there is really such a thing as "fate" in the world, then I have to ask "fate" to understand.</p>
<h3>People Who Don't Know New Year's Day</h3>
<p>— TK</p>
<h3>Year-End Musashino</h3>
<p>— Xiangshan</p>
<p>In the year-end in a foreign country, one is infected with a country sickenss, that is so vague, light and lingering, like the evil pole on a black festival night, listening to the clear and slight bell sound of the church, so lingering and light.</p>
<p>The sky is becoming clearer, in the early morning, pushing open the shoji window, the sky on the tangerine branches seems solid, throwing stones at the sky, making a worrying sound, this sound wave does not spread like spring waves, but like a cluster of arrows shooting at the sky; ah, it is deep winter, this solidified sky ah: far away in a remote alley, the desolate sound of the tofu vendor's trumpet, like the howling of the Huns outside the Great Wall, will bring you a desolate feeling.</p>
<p>Even though there is no longing for the homeland, the power that can lead you to indulge in longing is deeply hidden in the secret heart. All beauty and art are often imprisoned in the shackles of fantasy. When reading Gide's "Pastoral Symphony," one can envy the life of the blind! Fantasy and recollection, like lyrical poems, decorate the dilapidated with beauty and splendor.</p>
<p>Like a lark tired of singing, resting in the desolate Musashino in a foreign country, it is the end of the year, Musashino has dried up small rivers, withered grass, and broken old wooden bridges. This lark, faintly, caresses all the scenery with its eyeliner, skimming over the hills, and resting on the tombstone in the cemetery behind a desolate Bodhi temple. There is a blood-red red bead tree in front of the tomb.</p>
<p>I am like this lark, the desolate Bodhi temple at the bottom of Musashino has often become my strolling place. Musashino contains touching love stories. The flavor of history and the elegies of many poets, but for me, an exile, Musashino only has simplicity, which fascinates me, especially when listening to the wind in the wilderness of Musashino at night and reading Kunikida Doppo's Musashino Diary. This kind of interest is a synthesis of simplicity and fantasy.</p>
<p>When the sky is clear, on the prairie of Musashino and the tops of the withered trees, Mount Fuji, with its snow-covered top, stands out conspicuously. The charm of Fuji is completely concentrated in the snow on the top, which is white and does not melt; that kind of cold feeling, like a sharp sword, pierces into the body and mind, and one tastes satisfaction in a kind of shuddering.</p>
<p>Musashino not only gives a simple feeling, but also reminds people of many natural waka and haiku. These "songs" and "verses" give the most obvious contrast to Mount Fuji and Musashino. The wildness is like a spring. When your eyes look down at a piece of soil and a blade of grass, you can feel it deeply.</p>
<p>"The mountains are vast and the night has covered the sky, but only the peak of Mount Fuji still lurks in the twilight." This is Tayama Katai's song about the scenery after dusk in Musashino in winter; the vast sky of Musashino is covered with a slightly black and thin pattern, and the peak of Mount Fuji is particularly contrasted with its snow-white color, so it feels like a test of the memory that is still in the twilight. This kind of vague emotion is like gazing at the posture of a geisha with a Shimada-style headdress in the Yoshiwara red-light district under the willow trees on a foggy street, which is full of imagination.</p>
<p>Although there are only distant mountains and the Tama River and small streams, without a rare flower or a magnificent house, the toilet bowl placed next to the rice field, the toilet bowl with black crows perched on it, seems to have a kind of simple beauty and the smell of a farmer's house.</p>
<p>Especially during the day, the field is scattered with red and green flowers, which are the children in the village who are collecting field vegetables and alfalfa; they are wearing red and green tattered clothes, and with surprised eyes and exploring expressions, they are digging out their own food. This kind of energy and seriousness in life makes a wandering foreigner feel the alienation of life.</p>
<p>It is already winter, it is already the end of the year, those villagers carrying bamboo and pine on their backs are rushing to the city to decorate the Kadomatsu of the city people's homes (Japanese people all insert pine and bamboo in front of their doors during the New Year), and the cut-off roots of pine and bamboo that have been chopped off by the road one by one all have folded white marks, dotted in the withered grass.</p>
<p>Just waiting for the snow to fall, at that time Musashino will be wearing plain clothes, Mount Fuji will be wearing a plain crown, a kind of sad feeling will give anyone a heart that wants to shed tears, but they don't know the unspeakable emotion of where the tears come from.</p>
<p>Although Musashino has history, love, and a part of time and space, my love for Musashino is only for its simplicity, and the "haiku" and "waka" that I recall along with Musashino.</p>
<p>Winter Musashino is not decadent and desolate, it is more simple and can comfort people who are exiled in a foreign country near the end of the year.</p>

<p>HAPPY NEW YEAR!</p>
<h3>A Son with a Wife (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Yu Qijin</p>
<p>Old Fu Yun walked over limping. His body was so thin, hunched over; walking so weakly, panting and coughing. When he came closer, he put on a forced bitter smile on his gray face, and said tremblingly: "Sir, I beg you to write a letter for me."</p>
<p>I responded repeatedly, oh, oh, and dragged a bench for him to sit on.</p>
<p>"The letter is to my son, cough, asking him to put his ass down a little more steadily," a look of resentment appeared on his lips, "Speaking of my son, I can't breathe."</p>
<p>"Speak slowly, say whatever you want, I'll write it for you." I couldn't find words of comfort.</p>
<p>"That's right, sir, I'll have to take up a lot of your time, my words are very long! Don't hate me, I have to tell you the reason why I want to write this letter first." He seemed a little pleading.</p>
<p>"No, I have nothing to do, you can talk slowly."</p>
<p>"Alas, I always envy others. Not to mention anything else, like sir, your father is really lucky! To give birth to such a good son, ……" "What nonsense, what's so good about it!" I interrupted him, "Please tell me the reason why you want to write a letter."</p>
<p>"Er, er, yes, sir, I'll tell you. I remember very well: Thirty years ago, when my son was born, how excited my wife was! She would say dozens of times a day: "Ah Jun's dad, we have someone to rely on when we get old!" But, alas, my wife died before me; who knows, instead of relying on my son when I'm old, I'm suffering from my son!</p>
<p>His eyes were a little wet, and I could only say yes, but there was no way to comfort him.</p>
<p>"Five years ago, I married a wife for my son. Everyone in the village said: Old Fu Yun is really lucky. But who knows! After my daughter-in-law entered the door, my cheekbones became so high. When my clothes were tattered, -- just like now, -- people asked me with surprised expressions: Old Fu Yun, your clothes are not good, ask your daughter-in-law to mend them? I shook my head, and at this time I felt that they understood that I was not lucky, but was suffering!</p>
<p>"A son without a wife is still okay. He works in Shanghai, and at the end of the month, he sends a letter to my father, and sometimes attaches some copper coins for me. But in these five years, I have not received a letter from my son, -- what else to say about copper coins. -- Even if my son comes home, I want to talk to my son about my suffering as a friend, no, I can't, this daughter-in-law will stand opposite my son and stare, this stare seems to be saying: You don't have to soften your heart, you don't have to pity this old thing.</p>
<h3>Flies (Part 4)</h3>
<p>— By Pirandello, translated by Xi Dichen</p>
<p>They had been beating for a day and a half, and only a few almonds had fallen. The female workers proposed that they peel them all that night, peel them until late at night, and then just sleep there randomly, so that they could get up and return to the village early the next morning. They really did that. Lopa took the cooked beans and two long glass bottles of wine. The peeling work was completed in the middle of the night, and all the male and female workers lay down on the threshing floor and slept quietly. The grass left on the threshing floor was wet, and the dew was like the sky had really rained.</p>
<p>"Sing, Leola"!</p>
<p>Nelly sang immediately. The moon passed in and out of the thick net of small black and white clouds, and the moon was like Thursa's round face, which sometimes smiled slightly and sometimes frowned as the joy and sorrow of love rose and fell.</p>
<p>Chai Lu was once kept in the stable overnight. Salo ran to wake him up before dawn, but saw him swollen all over, black all over, and having a fever with boiling heat.</p>
<p>The above is a piece of what Nelly told the barber clerk. The barber clerk only listened, and inadvertently, his attention shifted to a point, and he cut him with his razor. Near his chin, he cut a small, small wound, which was nothing to speak of. Nelly didn't have time to think about it again, because at the entrance of the barbershop, he met Rusa and her mother, and also met Nita, Shimia, the poor girl promised to Chai Lu, who was crying sadly.</p>
<p>After all kinds of persuasion, this poor little man understood that she could not go to Montrusa to see her lover; they tried their best to call him back, and she would see him before dark. Salo also rushed over at this time, saying loudly that the doctor had already gotten on the mule and was not happy to wait any longer. Nelly dragged Rusa away and asked her to be patient; before dark, he would come back and have many wonderful things to say to her.</p>
<p>For lovers, really, even other people's emergencies are some wonderful words; when you talk about it, you hold hands and look at each other.</p>

<h3>Ode to the New Year</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>When I was a child, I often had a dream: "It would be great if we could celebrate the New Year every day." Even adults, as long as the rice jar at home is fortunately not empty, who wouldn't want to happily celebrate a few days?</p>
<p>The New Year is filled with peace, happiness, and hope.</p>
<p>For example, when you sleep in bed in the morning, even if you are awakened by Ah Da and Ah Er fighting for rice cake dumplings or throwing firecrackers, you are not getting enough sleep. If it were a normal day, you would inevitably scold "little devils" a few times, but during the New Year, this anger will never rise, and maybe it will become very affectionate, and you will give the little mouth a few sweet kisses, or even make a few impromptu promises, such as buying toys, making new clothes, or taking them to see a play. As for whether it will be implemented or not, it is up to you, and the children will always smile at you to show their goodwill, even when they find out that they have been tricked, the New Year has already passed anyway.</p>
<p>Also, for example, if you have been suffering from financial troubles and embarrassment for the past few days, you can completely forget about it during the New Year. Two friends who almost caused a police incident on New Year's Eve still greet each other with smiling faces and congratulate each other with hands cupped, "Get rich, get rich," their hearts filled with an extraordinary joy. Also, some people inevitably show some poverty at the end of the year, but when you meet him during the New Year, you have to listen carefully to his report on the wins and losses of gambling, and he seems to be very rich again.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for example, when eating at home, small disputes may inevitably arise on weekdays, such as complaining that the salted yellow croaker is too light because of your poor appetite, blaming the hard rice because of toothache, or complaining about the children's bad eating habits. But these things will never be taken to heart during the New Year. During the New Year, we must try our best to avoid the occurrence of all disputes. Even if something unexpected happens, and the children blurt out a few unlucky words, it must also be included in the "no taboos" column.</p>
<p>Moreover, the New Year is also a time for repentance, determination, and making vows. People who suddenly wake up from a daytime dream will say: "The past is like yesterday's death, and the future is like today's birth." The New Year is the beginning of the year, putting aside all the past behaviors of prostitution, gambling, corruption, and perversion, and then arranging a procedure on the spot on how to turn over a new leaf and how to work hard, or even friends who have never written before actually bought a three-sided diary, preparing to put out perseverance to write hundreds of words a day. During the New Year,</p>
<p>You can make more great wishes and generate more hope. As for what will happen after the New Year? There is no need to consider it during the New Year at all.</p>
<p>In short, all the phenomena of the New Year are fresh, vigorous, and energetic. The New Year is a day worth praising and celebrating!</p>
<h3>The Prelude to 1935</h3>
<p>— Cheng Quan</p>
<p>The cold wind blew ceaselessly throughout the night.</p>
<p>Dawn arrived, and a touch of gray light permeated the sky, hazy like a winter dusk. A vagrant huddled in the street corner, yawning, and opened his eyes: day had broken.</p>
<p>Rubbing his sleepy eyes, he stood up and peered out onto the street. The street was deathly silent. After a whole night of being trampled by passersby, it seemed injured, gasping for breath, yet also sinking into a deep slumber. Grayish-white frost covered the road, like the pallid face of a sick person.</p>
<p>Shops, one after another, were shuttered with iron gates. The national flags, hung out the previous night, flapped and danced incessantly in the cold wind. A sign stood straight at the entrance: "Happy New Year—Closed for three days."</p>
<p>Suddenly, a jolt: Another year had begun.</p>
<p>Looking at the sky: The sky remained deathly still.</p>
<p>Could it be that another year had slipped away? Yes, it couldn't be wrong, could it? Looking at the red-lettered newspaper in the hands of the deliveryman, looking at the red "January 1st" in the calendar vendor's hands, a thousand wrinkles seemed to form in one's heart: There was no mistaking it, another year had indeed passed.</p>
<p>Thinking: In this era, even individual wandering has become a global phenomenon. When the whole world has fallen into a season of wind and rain, perhaps everyone feels a bit unwell? We've already been battered by wind and rain for quite a few years; but why do those sufferings never seem to end? The world is like a train entering a mountain tunnel, endlessly dark.</p>
<p>(A streamlined 1935 Citroen sedan, packed with drunken people, men and women, wearing paper hats from a masquerade ball and releasing colorful balloons, rushed by aimlessly.)</p>
<p>In this era, being able to put oneself into a state of numbness might be happiness.</p>
<p>The cold wind hadn't stopped, and as it blew, one shivered: Everyone hopes the sun will rise sooner, everyone hopes for a warm spring.</p>
<p>Like a prayer, like a New Year's blessing, silently praying, one looked up at the sun. The sun was still hiding in the dark clouds, and one's heart sank, and one smiled unconsciously.</p>
<p>(Children were throwing firecrackers in the street, their sounds drifting clearly across the street. The sky was gradually brightening, and various people were walking on the street: office workers on holiday, students on break.)</p>
<p>A new atmosphere.</p>
<p>Yes. When a new year arrives, everyone gives themselves a new hope, a new beginning, right? Whether it is beautiful or ugly, people step into this year, and they must instinctively live on.</p>
<p>Each year is like a book. When we open the first page of a new book and begin to read its first word, who can know what it will contain?</p>
<p>But whether it is good or bad, it is always a new beginning.</p>
<p>It is said that 1936 will be a tense year, so 1935, which is right next to it, may not be an ordinary one. In the face of this coming year, there are two things: survival and death, joy and misery.</p>
<p>An era that progresses to this stage of tension is worth celebrating. Surely there are some more glorious events ahead: the glory of survival!</p>
<p>But whether it is light or darkness; whether it is an endless storm or a day of sunshine; come, come quickly!</p>
<p>Let us pray for this new 1935! In this season of wind and rain, let us hope it is a glorious one!</p>
<h3>Another Year</h3>
<p>— Wu Ye</p>
<p>Time passes like scenes in a movie, flashing before one's eyes. The 365 days of a year slip away in an instant. Ah! Truly, "time flies like a river"! I sigh as I remove the old</p>
<h2>Page 39</h2>
<p>calendar from my desk and replace the vacancy with a brand new calendar for the 24th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>A year has passed, and another year strides into the world. Naturally, in this quiet coming and going, I have grown another year older, and my life's history must lightly turn another page. However, let us examine this past page: Is there anything sufficient to comfort the past and encourage the future? I dare say that in the past year, encouragement and comfort are out of the question. Apart from aging by one year, everything else remains the same!</p>
<p>What gifts, then, shall I prepare to celebrate the beginning of this new year? In this year, there is nothing to rejoice over, and even less need to offer praise or prayers. However, unadulterated pessimism and despair are also inappropriate. The matters that stand before us still require us to struggle and to work: whether it is political encouragement, educational construction, rural relief, social reform, commercial revitalization, national strength, or the respect of morality... all rely on the cooperation of the government and the people. Only by cooperating and working together can we achieve success.</p>
<p>Looking back at our country in the past, whether in politics, society, the nation, or the people, we have almost always been groping in the dark, struggling in the darkness. The nation's troubles at this time cannot be denied. Natural disasters and man-made calamities are rampant, and internal and external problems are severe. The suffering endured by our people is truly unbearable to recall.</p>
<p>We now hope to find comfort in struggling from suffering, and to strive for light in the darkness. Naturally, we have great expectations for the coming new year. As for whether these expectations will be realized, that remains to be seen in the future.</p>
<h3>Celebrating the New Year</h3>
<p>— Hu Tianyu</p>
<p>I don't happen to be named Wang, nor do I go by Little Er, but fate has decreed that I am the same as Wang Xiaoer—each year worse than the last.</p>
<p>There is a saying in my hometown: "This year we hope for a better next year, [but] every year we wear a tattered cotton-padded coat." This saying is quite humorous, but unfortunately not very accurate. In my experience, I am indeed always hoping, today I hope for a better tomorrow, this year I hope for a better next year, but it is not necessarily "every year we wear a tattered cotton-padded coat." Saying this doesn't mean that my hopes have been realized, that things have indeed improved, that I don't wear a tattered cotton-padded coat, but rather wear a new cotton-padded coat, or a Western suit and leather overcoat. In fact, not only do I not have a Western suit and leather overcoat or a new cotton-padded coat to wear, but sometimes I even feel lacking in a tattered cotton-padded coat. Yes, didn't I get through one winter wearing a tattered lined robe?</p>
<p>To paraphrase the tone of "Fisherman's Song": "The tattered cotton-padded coat left over from the year before last, carefully I'll rely on it to get through another winter."</p>
<p>Now the New Year has arrived, the warm spring is about to descend, and soon I should be able to take off this very undignified tattered cotton-padded coat; because although I am poor, I am very fond of dignity.</p>
<h3>May Everyone Not Waste This Year</h3>
<h3>Year's End</h3>
<p>— Xu Xizhen</p>
<p>(The glass windows of a Vienna flower shop display Nandina and Wintersweet, a duet of red and yellow.</p>
<p>"Winter Solstice and New Year's gifts at great discounts, crowded every day, come quickly!")</p>
<p>Jazz music in a masquerade ball, a costume ball, red balloons, green balloons. A swollen Santa Claus, with a little trumpet in his hand, "toots" and laughs.)</p>
<p>Laughing, the boss of Tianfa Store said to his wife, "Don't worry, what's the use of worrying? It's the end of the year, but there's still a month or so until the settlement period. We have to get through this New Year season, come what may."</p>
<p>The wife was a little unconvinced, still wrinkling her brow, looking as if she was about to cry. The "Ah Da" in the store was also a bit suspicious, worrying that the market this year would be even worse, that there would be more failures, and that currency would be even more "impossible to circulate."</p>
<p>But the boss himself didn't believe it. He had started out "apprenticing" as a grocer, for at least twenty years. He had never encountered a year-end without a market. "Three spring seasons rely on one winter," otherwise, what kind of business could one do? He laughed at others for being foolish and fearing the sky would fall, for having narrow vision and being inexperienced.</p>
<p>But in fact, the boss might really be a bit muddled. Usually, someone who started out as an apprentice and spent twenty years in the "foreign goods business" would not fail to see that the market was getting worse every year, and that several stores would close down around every holiday season, not to mention—just talking about this year's "foreign Winter Solstice," they put up the red and green lights as usual, and hung up the flags with big discounts as usual, but the business was really not as good as last year. The money earned from selling for a week barely covered the "shop rent," and the labor was wasted! The boss didn't plan to think too much about these situations—perhaps he didn't dare to think. He placed all his hopes on the period before and after the settlement period. He knew very well that there was still a "Lunar New Year" waiting for him there, and he had to use all his energy to deal with it, to struggle.</p>
<p>But he may have carefully considered it in several late nights; two difficulties lay before him: inside was that his own store needed a little nourishment, for example, to paint the storefront and add some signs for advertising, or, if things went well, perhaps he could get a radio. In addition, the most important thing was that the store had to add some goods; but all of this was a problem because his own store was almost just a skeleton. Without cash, nothing could be done. And there was another major external obstacle, namely the malicious competition of larger-scale businesses. They used the advantages of large scale to lower prices to levels that smaller peers could not reach, and at the same time used the appeal of large advertisements to try to absorb as much cash as possible, and these were all the murderers who strangled the throats of small and medium-sized merchants!</p>
<p>These two enormous imaginary enemies, like two heavy shadows, pressed heavily on the heart of the Tianfa Store boss, desperately refusing to let go. He felt that this suffocation was dangerous. "Maybe one day, I will fall in front of my enemies."</p>
<p>However, although these difficulties oppressed him day and night, he refused to reveal them on his face. He was not a major entrepreneur, and of course lacked "iron willpower," but he also had his plans and his policies. The only solution at present was to first think of a way to "resist" (Note: to shift, to transfer) a little merchandise from several familiar "businesses" and prepare all his energy to deal with the "Lunar New Year" before the settlement period.</p>
<p>But the next day he got up early and ran to the familiar businesses he usually dealt with, he understood that things were not as easy as he had expected. The answers he received from each family were almost the same: "It's really hard to say, we are all old customers, is it possible that we don't trust you? But the inside instructed that from the New Year to the settlement period, all transactions will only be done in cash, and there will be no dealings—it's really not a good time, I'm afraid that there will be some places where things won't turn around at the end of the year—you know this difficulty."</p>
<p>These words may be true, but the boss of Tianfa Store was immediately pushed into an ice cave. He felt a chill and stood up to return to his store. Several shop assistants were flipping through the daily newspaper on the table. Suddenly he caught sight of the announcement of "×× Company Liquidation" and, as if he had received an inspiration, he casually asked a shop assistant:</p>
<p>"Is it still possible to send an advertisement to the newspaper within the year?"</p>
<p>"It's definitely possible, today is only the 26th, the newspaper's deadline for advertising is the 28th—New Year's Day, we'll have red newspapers to read again, a big stack!"</p>

<p>Wang Ersao, a virtuous woman from Guocun, Ganxi. Her husband died after the Northern Expedition. Ersao served her ailing mother-in-law above and cared for her orphaned children below. Relying on a few acres of ancestral land, she and her children wove and farmed, barely managing to make ends meet. Her cousin, Songquan, was of ill repute and had long desired to seize her chastity and property. He frequently borrowed money from her for gambling, and when his wishes were not granted, he would nag incessantly. Ersao's young daughter, Xiuzhen, was engaged to Liu Guoliang, a primary school teacher, with a promise of lifelong companionship. Songquan denounced this as a family disgrace and demanded money incessantly. Later, he flirted with Xiuzhen, attempting indecency. Guoliang arrived in time and denounced him as a beast, angrily driving him away. Songquan harbored a grudge and sought revenge. When the Red Army approached, Songquan was recommended by his comrades and appointed as a scout, responsible for identifying wealthy farmers and local bullies. Once Songquan gained power, he led the Red Army to arrest Guoliang and forced his widowed cousin to remarry a scoundrel, coercing Xiuzhen to submit to him, or else Guoliang would be put to death. Xiuzhen plotted to free Guoliang, enduring humiliation and reluctantly dealing with Songquan. At this critical moment, the anti-bandit army entered the village victoriously, eliminating the wicked and pacifying the good. Guoliang, with his meritorious internal assistance, was appointed to a military post. The Wang family, mother and daughter, were able to see the light of day again. Xiuzhen and Guoliang finally became husband and wife.</p>

<p>Shen Bao Supplement for the Port Film Special</p>
<h3>New Year's Greetings</h3>
<p>— Reporter</p>
<p>Happy New Year! - As esteemed readers turn the first page of the 1935 film special, these four characters seem particularly appropriate.</p>
<p>Because it is the New Year, everyone is in good spirits, having eaten their fill of good food and wine, and heading to the cinema to spend a happy day in laughter.</p>
<p>Because it is the New Year, everyone is getting rid of the old and welcoming the new, like the new clothes and hats they wear, filling their hearts with new hopes. For example, hoping to get married and have children this year, hoping to have the opportunity to be active in the political arena this year, hoping to win the fifty-million-dollar jackpot this year - no, hoping not to be unemployed this year.</p>
<p>Because it is the New Year, those who are concerned about the country and its people are naturally not so happy. For example, the national crisis is deepening, and another year has passed. The economic panic is intensifying, and the number of unemployed is increasing, which is bound to become more acute this year. The Nine-Power Treaty is being scrapped, and the opposite of disarmament is the vigorous expansion of armaments. The Second World War is imminent, and the people of our country will inevitably become cannon fodder on the Far Eastern battlefield. To mention these things on the first day of the New Year would inevitably spoil the mood, and even make those filled with hope feel half-hearted. But it is useless not to speak, and silence cannot turn misfortune into good fortune.</p>
<p>Because it is the New Year, the gentlemen of the film industry naturally have new plans. For example, producers hope that their employees will work especially hard this year, increasing production. Audiences suddenly become rich and watch movies day and night. There will be more super-special productions to break last year's box office records. On the other hand, directors, cinematographers, set designers, and other middle and upper-level employees, in addition to hoping to produce world-class masterpieces of their own, also hope to get a raise from one or two hundred yuan to four or five hundred yuan. Even if it is highly unlikely, it doesn't hurt to have bigger hopes. Actors hope to leap to stardom this year, and stars hope to be crowned emperors or queens, leading to unveilings, faces becoming trademarks, and extra income, lots and lots of it. As for the laborers on the set, in addition to hoping not to be electrocuted to death, they also hope not to be kicked out of the studio by the company without any reason, so as to avoid their wives and children crying.</p>
<p>Because it is the New Year, the film special naturally also has some basic hopes. For example, the film special does not talk about "revolution" or "progress" in the first place. In this year, it is already very remarkable to be able to say a few words that must be said and can be said. At the same time, the film special always maintains a fair position, without flattery, without conformity, without carelessness, with obligatory publicity, but never attempting to take subsidies or blindly promote. Therefore, it is hoped that people will not misinterpret or undermine it. And the esteemed readers who love this publication are constantly giving us criticism and correction, which the reporter sincerely welcomes on behalf of this publication. As for the improvement plan of this publication, of course, there is one, but there is no need to make a big fanfare or brag about it before implementing it.</p>
<p>That's all for now. Looking back at the above, it doesn't seem to make the readers smile happily, but rather makes them feel puzzled. This is certainly not appropriate in this great New Year. But it may be remedied here, anyway, it doesn't hurt to be too polite, so let's have another one:</p>
<p>Happy New Year!</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3>Review of "The Highway"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Realism in film is emphasized and demanded in China. The film that accurately portrays reality will become a great work. Furthermore, we demand that filmmakers scientifically observe reality, and then correctly analyze and experience it, and then boldly and bravely, without any embellishment, express it in film works. In other words, whoever reacts to reality most actively is the greatest writer of the era, and therefore his works are most likely to be supported by the vast audience.</p>
<p>Indeed, at this stage we still have to demand a new romanticism, but this romanticism starts from reality. That is to say, from a correct understanding of reality, and a scientific determination of its inevitable future, that is to say, seeing the inevitable creation of tomorrow in today. This ardent yearning for the future is regarded as romanticism, but this is by no means an unattainable fantasy, but rather has a historical determining significance. Therefore, we demand a new romanticism, while we oppose romantic fantasy.</p>
<p>After watching "The Highway," the above words seem to need to be emphasized. This is because the romantic component in "The Highway" far outweighs the weight of realism.</p>
<p>When exploring the inner workings of "The Highway," we may as well observe it in connection with the author's previous works. Mr. Sun Yu, who is called a poet, in "Little Toys," he loudly shouted for the entire people to resist Japan and save China, and save themselves. He placed the task of saving China on the entire people, so he had ardent hopes for national industrialists, and at the same time, the broad masses of people opposed imperialism, and the gentlemen and ladies standing on the balcony of the dance hall also opposed imperialism. From this point of view, it is naturally lacking in reality, but the author's passionate romanticism is fully expressed. Later, his "Sports Queen" put forward a brand-new view of sports, and at the end put forward the conclusion as romanticism, that is, the popularization of sports. Of course, this future outlook starts from reality, giving people great comfort. But now we see "The Highway," which is in the same posture as "Little Toys."</p>
<p>In "The Highway" and the prologue, the inspiration that the author gives us in his theme song (Pioneers of the Road) is "Thousands of years of fossils have accumulated into the mountain peaks on the ground. There is no road ahead, and human beings do not communicate. Who is hindering our progress?..." So he shouted: "Stand up with chest, unity don't loosen!" "Sighing is useless," "We are the pioneers of the road," "We will detonate the explosives buried underground and aim at them to blow!" "The earth is turned upside down, the mountain peaks are blown down, and the road is easy to start."... Here, his enthusiasm for the future of mankind is expressed in a majestic tone. So who will bear this great responsibility? The author places it on the broad masses of workers. In "The Highway Song," he wants the road workers to "carry the heavy burden and move forward!" "Everyone work hard, move forward together!" "Flatten the ruggedness on the road, crush the difficulties ahead," "Fight together," "No retreat, only forward." But this kind of enthusiasm is pinned on a non-realistic story, that is to say, "The Highway" is not a real expression. The most important thing is that he beautifies the lives of the road workers, and it is different from the fact that people in the play like Li Lili and Jin Yan are non-realistic characters.</p>
<p>Naturally, the author's consistent upward spirit and the expression of brightness, joy, and vigor all illustrate the greatness of the author's spirit. But it is in this situation that it proves that the author has neglected reality, no, perhaps he is deeply aware of the pain of reality and overcomes this pain with the glory of the spirit. It is very clear that when the road workers are tortured by traitors, he fully expresses the spirit of calmly facing death in the characters in the play. But that kind of cellar, Li Lili's flirtation, that kind of alertness and bravery, all make people wonder; is there really such a thing in the world? In this way, "The Highway" is inevitably very weak in terms of reacting to reality. As for the military officers and local bullies standing in opposition, and even helping the road workers, etc., it is also very worthy of discussion. And the point of "the spirit is immortal," although it is a true expression, is impeccable in terms of intention.</p>
<p>However, we always feel a great interest in this work. That bright tone, that firm spirit, and the excellent use of the sound effects of the dubbing, all express the content of the work in every aspect.</p>
<p>In all respects, this "The Highway" is not much different from "Little Toys." Everything that Mr. Sun Yu had in "Little Toys" reappears in "The Highway." Indeed, the author is a poet, a passionate poet. He hates ugliness, and he yearns for the bright future, but he does not face the essence of ugliness squarely, and at the same time, he does not pursue the bright future in a down-to-earth manner. However, we have ardent expectations for him, hoping that in the near future, he will change from the romantic style that does not start from reality.</p>

<h3>A Nurse's Romance (The White Parade) (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Su Yin</p>
<p>After Long Nawaier and Nao fell in love, he persuaded Nao to stop her nursing work and marry him to be his wife. But Nao did not agree and continued her studies. At this time, Qi Jie, because she knew a training doctor in the hospital named Moore, often went out to play with him after work in the afternoon and returned to the hospital late at night. The nursing supervisor in the hospital warned Na for returning late many times, violating hospital rules, and told her that she should prepare a sum of money to go home for a comfortable holiday.</p>
<p>That was Nao's last year of internship in the hospital. One day, Nao attended Long Na's birthday celebration. Because of the hospital's rules, she had to return to the hospital early. But Long Na did not allow her to go back, and Nao insisted that he send her back earlier. Therefore, a quarrel occurred between them. Later, Long Na could not resist her and sent her back to the hospital early. However, at that time, Long Na had drunk a lot of wine. On the way home after sending Nao to the hospital, the car had an accident, and Long Na was seriously injured and was taken to Miche Lee Hospital for treatment. After a series of surgical treatments, he gradually recovered his strength, but after staying in the hospital for several weeks, he asked the hospital to send Nao to be his exclusive nurse. Nao refused because she had already promised another female patient not to leave her when she was in pain. Because Nao refused to break her promise to that patient, she had to let Long Na be angry. Nao's behavior was deeply admired by the general public in the hospital, especially by the chief of surgery, Dr. Tony, who said that Nao was the most reliable person. At the same time, Dr. Tangmin's wife had a disagreement with him and specially ran to Paris to file a divorce lawsuit. Tangmin felt extremely painful in his heart at this time. Fortunately, Nao understood his heart and comforted him from time to time. Tangmin's feelings for Nao deepened.</p>
<p>At this time, there was only one week left before graduation. Qi Jie was expelled from school and could not graduate because she had returned to the hospital very late for three consecutive nights, so the joint council of teachers and staff unanimously decided to expel her. Qi Jie was extremely sad. What made her most sad was that Dr. Moore, who often took her out with him, was indifferent. That day, Long Na happened to have recovered well in the hospital and was about to leave the hospital. Nao specially asked a classmate to replace her work so that she could send Long Na off. When she was about to leave, she suddenly remembered that she had forgotten to hand over the key to the anesthetic medicine cabinet to her replacement. In a hurry, she handed the key to a servant who opened the elevator, and the servant handed the key to Qi Da, because Qi Da was going to the room where the anesthetic medicine cabinet was placed. Unexpectedly, Qi Jie took the key, secretly opened the medicine cabinet, and took a lot of morphine to swallow in an attempt to commit suicide. Fortunately, she was discovered not long after taking the poison. So everyone hurriedly rescued her, and Qi Da was thus able to celebrate her birth. However, because of a momentary negligence, Nao almost caused a major incident. According to the hospital's rules, she should be dismissed. However, Tang Ni tried his best to intercede for her, so Nao was able to retain her position.</p>
<p>That strange southern girl, Enna, did not study her work carefully, and she was indifferent to the exam. But when the graduation exam results were announced, she passed safely. Not only did she graduate and pass, but she also pitied Qi Da and planned for her, and even restored her original position. All of a sudden, a class of students was struck by a bolt from the blue, wondering what kind of magic power Enna had. Later, they learned that her father was the financial agent of this hospital, so she had the right to freely dispose of the hospital's administration. They had their graduation ceremony. After the graduation ceremony, Long Na came again to ask Nao to give up her nursing career and marry him to be a rich young mistress. But Nao felt that she should serve the people, so she sacrificed the vanity of a social leader and took up a nursing position. As a result, she got Dr. Tony's entire understanding, silently expressed his approval and admiration to her, and a romance ended here. (End)</p>

<h3>Summary of the Shanghai Municipal Library and Museum Projects</h3>
<p>— Dong Da You</p>
<p>Constructed by Zhang Yutai Construction Company</p>
<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>Culture is inseparable from life. Urban areas are where populations concentrate, making cultural development particularly urgent. Shanghai's residents have already reached over 3.4 million. Yet, existing cultural facilities are either too small or simply lacking, a truly regrettable situation! Recognizing this, the Shanghai Municipal Government designated a vast area in the city's center for an administrative district, allocating a portion for cultural facilities and encouraging private groups to lease land there to establish venues related to cultural education and exhibitions. In early 1934, the municipal government and most of its subordinate bureaus moved into the central city area, laying the groundwork for the Greater Shanghai Plan. Considering the urgency of cultural development, in addition to planning a municipal sports field southwest of the administrative district to meet citizens' needs for physical exercise, they also proposed building a municipal library and museum within the administrative district to provide citizens with resources for learning, research, and observation. The municipal sports field has already broken ground, and its outline has been reported in a separate publication. Now that the foundation stone of both the library and museum has been laid, a brief description of their architectural layout is presented below for the information of people from all walks of life.</p>
<p>II. Library</p>
<p>This library is located in the administrative district of the city center, between Fuqian Right Road and Funan Right Road, south of Fuxi Outer Road, facing east: opposite the museum. The floor plan is shaped like the Chinese character "工" (gōng), with the front part extended horizontally at both ends, projecting forward and backward to form wing-like structures. The maximum distance between the north and south ends is approximately 66 meters, the maximum distance between the east and west ends is approximately 51 meters, the building area is approximately 1,620 square meters, the total area of each floor is approximately 3,470 square meters, and the volume is approximately 25,000 cubic meters.</p>
<p>The majority of this library is a two-story building, with an average external wall height of approximately 12 meters. However, a gate tower is located in the center of the front facade, with its roof ridge approximately 25 meters above the ground (see the front and side views of the library). If there is a need for expansion in the future, there is no need to increase the height of the existing building; simply adding buildings of the same number of floors in the remaining space behind it can more than double the capacity.</p>
<p>The exterior of the library building adopts a hybrid style of modern and Chinese architecture, as purely Chinese styles are too expensive and not entirely practical. The gate tower is covered with yellow glazed tiles and adorned with ornate eaves, with a stone railing surrounding its platform, fully displaying Chinese architectural characteristics. The entire building is a reinforced concrete fireproof structure, with the external walls constructed of artificial stone. A large platform is set up in front of the main entrance, planted with flowers and trees. Flagpoles are erected on both sides of the platform to enhance the view.</p>
<p>Regarding the layout of the ground floor interior, the central entrance leads to a large hall, approximately 12 meters wide and 13 meters deep, connecting to the corridors on both wings and the grand staircase to the upper floors. Behind the hall is the magazine and newspaper reading room, approximately 17 meters wide and 14 meters deep. Further back is the book storage, approximately 30 meters wide and 11 meters deep, leading directly to the back door. This book storage is a particularly tall single-story structure (external wall approximately 13.5 meters high), to accommodate five-tiered steel bookshelves over two meters high. The total length of the arranged books is approximately 15,000 meters, with a capacity of approximately 400,000 volumes. The lower floor of the left wing houses various offices, and the lower floor of the right wing houses the children's library, rare book storage, and lecture hall (approximately 10 meters wide and 18 meters long).</p>
<p>The central part of the second floor is divided into two sections, with an exhibition room in the front, approximately 22 meters wide and 13.5 meters long, and a lending library and catalog room in the back, approximately 17 meters wide and the same length as the front. The left and right wings are corridors, study rooms, and special reading rooms, with reading rooms at the horizontally extended parts at both ends, approximately 26 meters wide and 10 meters long, each accommodating 150 seats.</p>
<p>Above the central front part of the second floor is a mezzanine, used as a storage room, from which one can reach the flat roof behind and ascend the gate tower via outdoor steps. This gate tower can be used as an exhibition hall, and its surrounding platform can be used for sightseeing. A portion of the area beneath the magazine and newspaper reading room is excavated to build a basement for boiler installation.</p>
<p>The interior of the hall, lending library, and exhibition hall are decorated in a purely Chinese style with magnificent decorations and vermilion columns. The floors of the staircases and corridors are paved with polished stone, the floors of the reading rooms are paved with cork blocks, and the floors of the remaining areas are covered with inlaid sandalwood and rubber blocks.</p>
<p>The library's construction budget is estimated at 300,000 yuan, excluding the construction cost of the steel bookshelves inside the book storage. Zhang Yutai won the bid for the construction project, which commenced in September 1934 and is expected to be completed in August 1935.</p>
<p>III. Museum</p>
<p>This museum is located in the administrative district of the city center, between Fuqian Left Road and Funan Left Road, south of Fudong Outer Road, facing west, opposite the library. The floor plan shape is similar to that of the library, but the two ends of the front wing only protrude forward (see the museum floor plan). The maximum distance between the north and south ends is approximately 60 meters, the maximum distance between the east and west ends is approximately 58 meters, the building area is approximately 1,900 square meters, the total area of each floor is approximately 3,430 square meters, and the volume is approximately 19,000 cubic meters.</p>
<p>The central part and the two front wings of this museum are two-story buildings with an external wall height of 10.5 meters. A gate tower is added, with a roof ridge approximately 24 meters high. The protruding parts of the two front wings and the two rear wings are single-story buildings with a wall height of approximately 6.5 meters (see the front and side views of the museum). The future expansion plan of this museum also aims to add buildings in the remaining space, and the building area after expansion can be doubled.</p>
<p>The exterior appearance of the museum is generally the same as that of the library, but the beams and columns of the gate tower are exposed, and fountains are set up in front of the protruding parts of the left and right wings to enhance the decoration. The entire building is also a reinforced concrete fireproof structure, and the external walls are built with artificial stone.</p>
<p>In terms of the interior layout, the central entrance on the ground floor is the hall, approximately 17.5 meters wide and 14 meters long, with stairs to the upper floors and cloakrooms and sales rooms attached. From here, the door leads to a large hall, approximately 11.5 meters wide and 18 meters long, where the main staircase is located. On both sides of the hall are corridors leading to offices, study rooms, and storage rooms in the left and right wings of the front part. The protruding part of the left wing is the library, approximately 10 meters wide and 15 meters long, with a capacity of approximately 100 seats. The protruding part of the right wing is the lecture hall, with the same length and width as the library, with a capacity of approximately 300 seats.</p>
<p>The second floor is arranged with three sections in the center as exhibition halls and sculpture halls. The one in the front is the largest, approximately 17 meters wide and 14 meters long. The two wings are calligraphy and painting exhibition halls, each approximately 11.5 meters wide and 25 meters long, covered with glass skylights.</p>
<p>Above the central two-story front exhibition hall is a mezzanine, with the ground level flush with the flat roof in the back. From here, you can reach the gate tower on the fourth floor via outdoor steps. A platform is also set up around the gate tower for sightseeing. There is a basement under the hall for setting up boilers, etc.</p>
<p>The interior decoration aims to create an appropriate background for the exhibits. The hall and main exhibition hall are decorated with red columns and palace-style painted railings and flat ceilings. Most of the floors are paved with polished stone, the floors of the important exhibition halls are paved with inlaid sandalwood, and the corridors are also paved with polished stone. The lighting in each exhibition hall aims to project most of the light onto the exhibits without causing reflections into the eyes of the audience. The area where paintings are hung receives light from the upper side, so that it shines obliquely on the wall, allowing the audience to face the bright paintings in the shadows, making them clearer. The lighting equipment adopts an "indirect" style, the purpose of which is the same as above. Because the exhibition halls on the upper floors do not have windows and rely on glass skylights for lighting, artificial methods must be used to replace the air. The building has a built-in ventilation system that distributes cold and warm air according to the season.</p>
<p>The construction cost of this museum is estimated at 300,000 yuan, and Zhang Yutai won the bid for the construction project. Construction commenced in September 1934 and is scheduled for completion in August 1935.</p>
<p>IV. Conclusion</p>
<p>The above description only covers the engineering aspects of the library and museum in the central area of Shanghai. As for the equipment aspects, such as the collection of books and magazines and the search for exhibits, efforts should be made to achieve completeness to meet the needs of promoting culture. However, this matter is of great importance and cannot be accomplished overnight. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will assist from the sidelines and jointly contribute to its success. This is sincerely wished and prayed for!</p>

<h3>Summary of the Shanghai Municipal Hospital and Hygiene Laboratory Project, whose groundbreaking ceremony is held today</h3>
<p>— Dong Da You</p>
<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Hospital is built in the east of the administrative area in the city center, covering an area of about 80 mu, bordering Funan Left Road to the west, Fudong Outer Road to the north, Huabang Road to the east, and Qiujiang River to the south. The Hygiene Laboratory is located to the east of the Municipal Hospital, covering an area of ten mu, at the intersection of Huayuan Road and Fudong Outer Road. The two are located next to each other, and will form the city's medical center, combining medical treatment, research, and education facilities. The arrangement and planning of the buildings also follows the principle of facilitating the connection and unified management of these two parts.</p>
<p>II. Municipal Hospital</p>
<p>(A) Overall Plan The main buildings of the Municipal Hospital are divided into the following nine parts: (see the overall site plan)</p>
<p>Internal Medicine Hospital Two buildings</p>
<p>Surgical Hospital Two buildings</p>
<p>Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital One building</p>
<p>Pediatrics Hospital One building</p>
<p>Outpatient Department and Otolaryngology and Ophthalmology Hospital One building</p>
<p>Nursing School and Dormitory One building</p>
<p>Management Office and Medical School One building</p>
<p>The above buildings are arranged with the Management Office and Medical School in the center, facing Fudong Outer Road. The Outpatient Department and Otolaryngology and Ophthalmology Hospital and the Nursing School and Dormitory are located on both sides. The other hospitals are arranged in a "fan-shaped" pattern to the south of the three, with their long sides roughly facing east and west. This arrangement is not only aesthetically pleasing, but also facilitates communication between departments, ensures air circulation, and provides ample light. Trapezoidal open spaces between the buildings are used as gardens for patients to relax during their recovery period. The total capacity of the hospitals is approximately 1,000 beds.</p>
<p>In addition to the above main buildings, there are auxiliary buildings such as staff residences, male and female staff dormitories, kitchens, service rooms, and workshops. The kitchens, service rooms, etc. are located in the southwest corner of the site, next to Funan Left Road and the Qiujiang River, to isolate them and maintain the tranquility of the hospitals. The prevailing winds in Shanghai come from the northeast, northwest, and southeast, so this arrangement ensures that the hospitals are not disturbed by smoke. Staff residences and dormitories are located in the southeast corner of the site, next to Huayuan Road and the Qiujiang River, and are also isolated from the main buildings. (B) Initial Project Considering the grand scale of the Municipal Hospital, the construction cost is naturally enormous, and it is necessary to carry out the project in phases to ease financial pressure. The first phase of the project is limited to meeting the current needs of diagnosis and treatment. The main buildings currently under construction are the Management Office and Medical School in the overall plan, which will be temporarily used for hospital purposes after completion. The building is approximately 80 meters long and 16 meters deep, with a building area of approximately 1,060 square meters. The total area of each floor is approximately 4,500 square meters, with six floors including the basement in the middle and four floors in the two wings.</p>
<p>The exterior adopts a simple and modern style with straight lines, matching the public buildings in the central administrative area. Because Chinese-style architecture is more expensive and the use of the site is difficult to be economical, it is not entirely adopted, but the decoration takes it as the standard, so that the spirit of the national culture is incorporated into modern equipment. This building is a steel-reinforced concrete structure, the outer walls are made of artificial stone, and the partition walls of the internal corridors are made of hollow bricks. Most of the internal partition walls are made of wood, so that they can be easily moved and rebuilt in the future. The floors of the wards are paved with rubber blocks, and the floors of the hall, operating rooms, and workshops are paved with polished stone. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Life of Taiwanese Aborigines</h3>
<p>— (Photos by Chen Xiehou, text by Hu Bozhou)</p>
<p>Taiwan is formed by merging Taiwan Island, the Penghu Islands, and affiliated islands, with an area of 2332 square miles. The climate is semi-tropical, the scenery is beautiful, the land is fertile, and it produces timber, tea, camphor, rawhide, sugar, rice, and other items. As early as the first year of Emperor Yang of Sui's Daye reign (605 AD), it had relations with our country. At that time, the area was entirely inhabited by uncivilized natives. During Emperor Xianzong of Tang's Yuanhe era, the Shi family moved to Penghu, and since then, large numbers of Han Chinese began to immigrate to Taiwan. In the early Yuan Dynasty, the post of patrol inspector was officially established in Penghu to manage civil affairs. In the late Ming Dynasty, it was occupied by the Dutch. Zheng Chenggong expelled the Dutch and took over the area, and actively managed it. He resisted the Manchu Qing. After the demise of the Zheng regime, it returned to Qing rule. It was ceded to Japan in the Sino-Japanese War. The Japanese, citing Taiwan's self-organized republic, carried out massacres, staining the entire island with blood. All the governors-general were naval and army generals who adopted a policy of pure military force. Then, they imposed heavy taxes to exploit and extract the blood and sweat of the Taiwanese people to enrich their homeland. Therefore, the Taiwanese people repeatedly rose up in revolution, attempting to overthrow Japanese rule. Up to 1919, there were a total of fourteen recorded uprisings. Last November, the Taiwan Revolutionary Party revolted and hundreds of people were arrested. Of Taiwan's 3.5 million people, apart from more than 100,000 aborigines and 140,000 Japanese, the rest are descendants of our country's Fujian and Guangdong people. Revolutionary ideas are very rich. Although under the rule of power, there will surely be a day of independence and freedom. As for the aboriginal peoples who were the earliest inhabitants of Taiwan, because our people colonized there, they gradually retreated from the plains to the mountains, cut off from the plains people, and unable to accept modern civilization, they still maintain their primitive lives. Only the aborigines on the eastern coast and those close to the plains have evolved slightly and know how to farm. The pictures published here give a glimpse. However, the Japanese government imposes heavy taxes on these evolved aborigines, equivalent to the Taiwanese, reaching more than thirty yuan per person per year.</p>
<h3>(1) Distant View of Tianbao Rock</h3>
<p>Hualien Port in eastern Taiwan has a mountain called Haishe Mountain, with a huge rock protruding from the deep valley on the summit, named Tianbao Rock. Standing on it, the wind caresses the clothes, as if soaring in the sky. Looking down, the deep ravine is bottomless, making people feel dizzy and afraid to look for long. Three aboriginal women are squatting on the edge of the rock, looking into the distance as if nothing is wrong.</p>
<h3>(2) Aboriginal Beauty</h3>
<p>Aborigines tattoo patterns on their heads, faces, and all parts of their bodies to be considered beautiful. The central aboriginal woman is the beauty of the aboriginal people. She also has tattoos on her forehead. When pointing straight to her eyebrows, she was weaving cloth outdoors.</p>
<h3>(3) Aboriginal Suspension Bridge</h3>
<p>The bridge is made of iron wire, with wooden planks laid on top, suspended high above the river valley. Only pedestrians can cross the bridge, no vehicles. It is hundreds of feet long and over a hundred feet high. Standing on it are four aborigines.</p>
<h3>(4) Houses of the Hengchun Paiwan Tribe</h3>
<p>The Paiwan are a type of uncivilized aborigines. The structure of their houses is quite unique. First, a wide ground cave is dug, and then naturally produced stone plates are densely covered on top as roof tiles, only a few feet above the ground. From a distance, it looks like a flat ground. Many of this tribe who live in the mountains live in mountain caves, making it difficult for aircraft to detect their location, so when there is a rebellion and suppression, they feel extremely difficult.</p>
<h3>(5) Dabang Exchange</h3>
<p>The Dabang Exchange is located in Alishan, Tainan, and was established by the Japanese. The aborigines bring what they have harvested to the exchange to exchange for what they need. What they like best is wine and matches. There are more than 100 such exchanges throughout Taiwan, operated by the Taiwan Police Association.</p>
<h3>(6) Aboriginal Women Grinding Millet</h3>
<p>The Alishan forest area is a timber production area, with an annual output value of two million yuan. There are many uncivilized aborigines in the mountains who used to go down the mountain to kill people and take their heads for sacrifice. Later, they were taught by Taiwanese Wu Feng, and this custom ceased. Recently, the Japanese government has carried out educational reforms, and many can speak Japanese. This shows the situation of aboriginal women from remote tribes in the mountains grinding millet.</p>

<h3>(1) West Peak of Mount Hua</h3>
<p>— (Sent by Simao)</p>
<p>West Peak, also known as Lotus Peak, is slightly shorter than South Peak. Black pines grow in the crevices of the rocks. There are many stones that can be counted. There is a large piece of rock that is dozens of feet long floating on the top of the peak, broken into three parts. It is commonly known as the Axe-Split Stone. The bumps and dents on the stone that resemble toe marks are commonly called the Giant's Footprints, and are the same as the Immortal Palm of East Peak, which are commonly admired by people.</p>
<h3>(2) Changkong Plank Road at Nantianmen</h3>
<p>— (Photo by Yu Pingke)</p>
<p>Going west from Nantianmen, there is a narrow path called Changkong Plank Road. A three or four-inch wide path is built halfway up the cliff wall. Iron stakes are inserted into the wall to support narrow planks to make room for the feet. Horizontal iron chains are strung on the wall to hold onto. In the middle of the path where it is not connected up and down, double chains are hung to connect the people. People walking between them must stretch their arms and climb the chain to move their feet horizontally, which is extremely dangerous.</p>
<h3>(3) Mountain Road on West Peak</h3>

<h3>(8) Lao Jun's Navel</h3>
<p>Many place names on Mount Hua are named after Lao Jun, such as Lao Jun's Plow Groove, Lao Jun's Alchemy Furnace, Lao Jun's Hanging Plow Place, and this one makes four.</p>
<p>Mount Hua in Shaanxi is the most majestic and towering mountain in our country's famous mountains. In the past, Han Tuizhi climbed to the top and looked down in horror, even writing a letter to his family to say goodbye. Its danger can be known. From the foot to the top, it was called forty li in ancient times. According to the latest actual measurement, it is about thirteen li. However, climbing is extremely difficult. The most dangerous places have been carved with stone steps or stone railings or wound with iron chains or paved with plank roads since the Tang Dynasty, so that tourists can easily reach its top. However, places such as Climbing Heaven Ladder and One Hundred Foot Gorge have inclination angles of up to 90 degrees, standing vertically against the wall and rising against the chest. Those with weak physical strength will return without success when they reach this point. The highest point is Luoyan Peak, about 8,000 feet above sea level. Standing on it, looking around, the north view of the mountain shade and the peaks are arranged at the foot, and the distant view of the He Luo and Wei plains and the high plains of the three Jin dynasties are vertical and horizontal for thousands of miles are all in sight. Looking south, the mountain faces a deep ravine. The mountains south of the ravine are continuous.</p>

<p>North Peak, also known as Yuntai Peak, is narrow and long, and the sharp peak is towering. A path leads diagonally to its narrowest point, which is Xianren Bian.</p>
<h3>(11) East Peak Pagoda</h3>
<p>The pagoda is built on a dangerous cliff, like a sword standing upwards, which is quite unique.</p>
<h3>(12) East Peak of Mount Hua</h3>
<p>— (Sent by Simao)</p>
<p>East Peak, also known as Chaoyang Peak, has a temple on it called Bajing Palace. Outside the palace is a dangerous road called Yanzi Turns Over Place. The Chess Pavilion is nearby.</p>
<h3>(13) South Peak of Mount Hua</h3>
<p>— (Sent by Simao)</p>
<p>South Peak, also known as Luoyan Peak, is the highest point of Mount Taihua, about 8,000 feet above sea level. There are scenic spots such as Laozi Temple and Heilongtan Yantian Pool on the top of the peak. The texture of the stone walls and the slender pine forests are also spectacular.</p>
<h3>(14) One Hundred Foot Gorge</h3>
<p>— (Photo by Shen Xingchu)</p>
<p>One Hundred Foot Gorge is above Thousand Foot Cliff, also known as One Hundred Zhang Cliff. The steep wall hangs down, carving stones on the wall to make room for feet, and iron stakes are placed in the stone holes to connect iron cables above, so that tourists can climb along the wall to ascend to the clouds.</p>

<h3>Exploring the Zilai Cave</h3>
<p>There is an ancient Zilai Cave on Yu Huang Mountain in the south of Hangzhou. Legend has it that it can hold ten thousand people and the bottom of the cave leads directly to Huizhou in Anhui Province. In the past, the entrance of the cave was covered by weeds and smoke, and no one had ever explored it. Recently, the Hangzhou National News Agency and the National Army joined forces to form a Zilai Cave exploration team in order to break various superstitions and inspire the national spirit of adventure. The exploration revealed that the claim of reaching Huizhou was completely unfounded. The cave is approximately 150 yards deep. The path into the cave is rugged, and the cave floor is as flat as a water surface, formed of fine mud. The team placed a pre-prepared commemorative wooden plaque at the deepest point of the cave. Afterwards, it was announced that anyone who independently retrieved the commemorative plaque would be rewarded. The news from the Hangzhou National News Agency spread, and Cantonese athletic experts such as Zhou Zhaohua entered the cave and retrieved the wooden plaque. Subsequently, the number of visitors increased daily. The Military Coordination Committee then cut rocks and erected wooden structures in the cave to facilitate tourists. Since then, another scenic spot has been added between the Three Tianzhu Temples and the Six Bridges.</p>
