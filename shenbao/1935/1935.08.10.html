<p>時評</p>
<h3>論德國反猶運動</h3>
<p>— 恒</p>
<p>自德國國祇黨執政以後。反猶運動。卽接踵而起。年來本已沈寂。最近英德海約簽字。此項運動。又復勃興。此乃德國執政當局所授意。殊爲明顯。據德國內長佛里克宣稱。德國之反猶運動。原因有二。（一）猶太人在德國各種事業上有喧賓奪主之勢。德人爲自衛計。有排斥猶太人之必要。（二）爲保持亞利安種族之純粹計。亦有排斥猶太人之必要。前一原因。似不失爲一種老實話。蓋猶太人自國社黨執政以還。隊德者雖已達數十萬。然留居德國者。尙有一百數十萬之多。在此德國失業問題無法解决之秋。目光四射之國社黨自不能不注意及此。然後一原因。殊非事實眞相。良以今日之日耳曼人。種族上早不純粹。此爲稍治人類學與西洋史者所共知。不容一筆抹殺者也。</p>
<p>美國生物派社會學家漢金斯曾謂。「純粹之種族。於歐洲歷史上任何一時代。皆找不到。」美國。人類學家蒲士亦謂。根據科學的研究。歐洲任何部分。皆無純粹之種族。」此皆就事實歸納之結論。非向壁虛構隨意武斷者可比。蓋歐洲今日之國家。無慮二十餘國。就其民族形態觀之。大約可分三類。卽在歐洲北部者多碧眼金髮。在中部者層色較濃。頭形較圓。在南部地中海諾國者。則體格較小而活潑。然以上三型。同時又形成一種錯綜複雜之狀態。如代表碧眼金髮之所謂亞利安種。德人中雖佔多數。然在亞洲種之芬蘭人中。斯拉夫族之波蘭人中。法人中。意大利北方人中。甚至北非之柏拍人中。亞洲西部之克爾茲人中。皆有分佈。而膚色較深之一型。則凡東歐之斯拉夫族。奧國之日耳曼人。德國南部之人。意國北部之人。及法國中部及阿爾卑斯山區之人。皆可歸入。至於地中海型。意大利雖爲代表。然西班牙人·希臘人·以及小亞細亞人。亦皆屬於此類。可知歐洲之種族。混淆殊甚。無論任何國家。皆不能以某一種族之代表自居。卽以德國而論。碧眼金　之亞利安型固多然黑髮者·紅髮者·方額闊面者亦所在多有、是則今日之德人、已非純粹之亞利安種、彰彰明甚。更何得以保持種族之純粹。而排斥非亞利安之猶太人哉。</p>
<p>再就西洋歷史觀察。尤見今日之德人。去純粹之血統甚遠。日耳曼人發源於北歐一。世紀後始向南發展。同時高加紫方面之斯拉夫族。亦向西北發展。與日耳曼人之東南移動。成一交流狀態。於此期間。種族上之混雜。自所難免。至五世紀時。日耳曼人再向南移。其所遺地區多爲位於其北之斯拉夫人所佔。幾達今日德國版圖三分之二。如是者幾五百年。直至中世紀時。日耳曼人勢力膨脹。始對斯拉夫人壓迫。然此亦僅爲一種殖民運動。且兩族通婚。並無限制。故血統相混。至難剖分。加之。當時之斯拉夫人。以文化較低大抵。爲日耳曼人所同化。及至三次瓜分斯拉夫族之波蘭。日耳曼兵士。往往娶波蘭女子爲妻室。血統愈形混淆。故研究西洋史者。多謂德人之中。斯拉夫人之血。至少當佔四分之三。至今日之普魯士。則斯拉夫之成分。更　於此。洵非虛語。且十七世紀初葉之三十年戰爭。幾全以今日之德境爲戰塲。戰士之來往於德者。不僅有法人·奧人·瑞典人·丹麥人·更有匈牙利人·韃靼人·哥薩克人·此輩奸淫婦女。視爲常事。其後法皇路易十四壓浪新敎徒新敎徒。之遷入德境者。無慮數萬人。依此而觀。德國蓋早已不能保持其種族之純粹矣。</p>
<p>卽以德國今日排斥最烈之猶太人而論。其血液於德人中亦屬不少。蓋猶太人移入德境。幾與日耳曼人同時。就歷史言。至少有一千五百年之久。中世紀時。受德人之壓迫。大抵改入耶敎。與德人通婚此種。改敎運動迄今未衰故猶太人之同化於德者。於此長時期內其數尤不可勝計。據美國加州大學敎授柏度佛言。德人之含有猶太人血分者。當有一千萬人。皆無可識別。德國今日所資爲猶太非猶太人之標識者。不外（一）是否信奉猶太敎。（二）最近數代之家世。而於往昔改敎同化於德之人。固無術以辨別也。據最近統計。德國境內。至今仍奉猶太敎者。僅剩五十萬人。改敎者已達三十萬人。其中可資考査之德猶混血者七十萬人。同時猶太人與德國女子之發生性關係者。不可勝數。於此可知德猶兩種族。因多年來同化與混血之關係。早無純粹之可言。德國當局今乃抹殺德意志民族構成之種種因素。僅取歷史之片段。以爲排猶運動之理由。理論上無乃過於薄弱乎。</p>

<h3>羅斯今日首途來華　調查我國經濟　過日小作勾留探詢竟見　倫敦否認發起英日會議</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英政府經濟顧問長羅斯爵士定明日偕其夫人與財部巴志及英倫銀行專家羅傑士、乘不列巓皇后號前往加拿大、然後改乘亞洲皇后號而往中國、當路過日本時、將在東京暫游數日、據留心遠東時事者云、羅斯之游東京、不過探詢日本意見耳、並不欲與日政府作直接之商榷、亦不欲提交任何計畫、羅斯虛懷、毫無成見、倫敦人士已熟悉日本事伴者、謂日本準備與英國討論遠東時局、以期有建設行爲、但不願聞舉行國際會議涉及他國複雜的動作者之議云、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）此間並未提議召開英日會議、爲確定之事實、外間傳說當由羅斯爵士明日啟程赴華而起、至於羅斯爵士中國之行、官方以爲中國貨幣之穩定、應爲國際行動云、（八日字林西報專電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英政府首席經濟顧問羅斯爵士起程赴日本中國之行、已引起此間報紙種種揣測、惟英日能否合作、此間人士多持懷疑態度、因日本將向英索取重要經濟權利、可以不卜而知、唯英國能否獲得日本同樣利益、則殊爲難必、晨報謂、羅斯爵士於赴日前、或先往華盛頓一行、亦未可知、蓋英國對美不願處於反對地位也、故英國若助中國、必邀美日共同行動、惟此種行動能否切合日本之意、亦不無懷疑、（九日國民電）</p>
<p>（東京）近因松平大使歸國及英國羅斯氏之渡日、發生各種風聞、外交當局於九日發表談話、闡明事實之眞相、其內容如左、日本政府對於松平大使並無任何新提案之事實存在、據一部分人之傳說、謂日英當局會議將於今秋舉行云云等語、亦無其事、日本政府希望英國對於東亞日本之安定勢力、使之有正當認識促其實現、正在次第進行、固係事實、但上項情形傳聞失實、且對於羅斯氏之來日、以爲該氏在東京有所工作、但英國政府之派遣該氏、僅以對華經濟調査之名義通知日本方面而已、日本方面至今尙未認爲有派遣經濟視察團赴華而與羅斯氏有協力之必要也云云、（九日日聯電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）關於羅斯提唱中國參加英鎊團體、日本原來反對中國貨幣興英鎊聯絡、主張與日金結合者、故對羅斯之提唱亦必反對之、因此英國政府擬向日本爲代償的或種種經濟上之提案藉以和緩日本之反對、又羅斯於出發之前、與關於日英提携素有研究之瑪哥灣氏班皮爵士等交換意見、（九日電通電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英政府首席經濟顧問羅斯爵士、定於星期六啟程赴華、路過東京時將暫勾留、與日政府官員討論一般經濟狀况、此問咸信此係英國與日本之初步談判、此後將討論一切懸案、海軍問題亦在其內、（八日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英政界解釋松平大使之回國使命、在促進日英兩國之諒解、實現兩國提携、故松平大使在本國之行動、與駐中日兩國大使館經濟顧問羅斯氏之赴任、均惹起一般注目、蓋衆信羅斯將與日本政府當局協議在世界及遠東日英關係之全盤的重要問題、英國政府現在雖謹愼力避與日接近、採取對華同一行動、以免傷害中國感情、然日本在遠東地位今已不可蔑視、故一般人承認日英合作、爲對華援助之先行條件、已屬明顯之事實也、（八日日聯電）</p>

<h3>實部謀救濟工商　擬定三項辦法</h3>
<p>研究統制增加國際貿易　訂定保護政策考察外銷</p>
<p>新新社云、實業部鑒於我國近來農村經濟破產、國際貿易入超甚鉅、國民經濟因之日見窮困、工商業極度蕭條、現特擬定救濟辦法三項、積極進行、茲分錄於左、</p>
<p>增進輸出</p>
<p>（一）年來國際經濟政策、時見更迭、或則旣低幣　、管理對外匯兌、統制貿易實施限額制度及提高關稅等、凡可以增進輸出、而能禁止入口者、無不盡量施行、而我國輸出之商品如絲茶綢棉及蛋品等、皆受各國增稅及限額壓迫影響、以致出口貨日益减少、並正研究統制辦法、一俟擬就、即會同有關係各部、商討有效補救辦法、以作根本之救濟、同時將於本月中句舉行、</p>
<p>保護政策</p>
<p>（二）我國出口商品、營業狀况向少績密調查、及精確統計、其輸出情形、無由而知、刻正擬製表式、令行各省市地方政府、調查各種出口之商品、營業狀况、以作訂立保護政策之參考、並調查產品性質、凡可以推銷國外者、即指導各商、設法宣傳試銷、及令駐外各領事館代爲介紹、一面搜集樣品、轉發國內各廠商倣造、以資推銷、</p>
<p>考察外銷</p>
<p>對外貿易之推進盡利、須明瞭國外商情、是以歐美各國、常有國外商業考察之派遣、而我國僑民散居國外、近受世界不景氣之影響損失極鉅、若欲謀相當之救濟、須有精確之考察、陳部長有鑒於此、曾於去年親赴南洋各屬視察、現除積極籌備考察團赴暹羅各工廠考察商業狀况外、並繼續派員前往歐美日本、作同樣之考察、俾資改進、所有赴暹考察團之人選及經費預算、已在審核中、不久即可見諸事實、</p>

<h3>小男兒（十）</h3>
<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄（宗海）譯</p>
<p>他們這一般談話悉已入於裴夫人的耳中，但是她彷彿祇專心在倒牛奶和照應着小坦第，其時這賽貝已是矇朧欲睡，他竟放他的瓢匙到眼邊，點着頭像臨風的罌粟，終於把面頰靠在一塊軟的小麵包上，沉沉睡去了，原來裴夫人所以置乃德於韜摩的旁座便因那個旣胖又矮的童子對人一團和氣，瞇隨便便，所以羞澀的人很愛和他接近。乃德也覺到這一點，在一席晚餐的時候，竟向他說了幾句知心話，這恍似給裴裴夫人以一個銷　，可從以知道這個童子的品性，遠勝於她自己和他談話呢。</p>
<p>在勞先生介紹乃德前來的信裏，他曾說道：</p>
<p>親愛的蜀，——這裏是深合你心意的一件東西。這可憐的童子現在已是一個孤兒，貧苦而又無可吿訴。他一直是沿街奏樂聊求餬口：我發現他在一個地窖裏，傷念他已故的父親和喪失的提琴。我想，他是可以造就的，因此自忖我們幾個人或者可給這個小小的人兒一援手。你治療他辛勞疲憊的身體，茀力子幫助他荒廢怠弛的心思，等到有成之後，容我看他還是個天才，或祇略具才能，得一技一藝以自免於凍餒罷了。且給他一個機會，如其不爲別的而祇爲了你自己的童子。「坦第」</p>
<p>裴夫人讀了這封信，叫道，一當然我們願意的」！等到她一見乃德，她就立刻覺得，不論他是否天才，當前總是一個貧病交迫孤苦無依的孩子，他所需要的正是她所樂於給與的，便是一個家庭和慈母一般的將護。她和裴先生暗暗地在觀察他；覺得他雖然衣服襤褸，面目汚穢，行動也不自然，却自然有不少令人可愛之處。他是一個十二歲年紀的男孩子，面蒼白瘦削，眼色碧藍，在蓬鬆不櫛的頭髮下却有一個廣　；臉上有時忽露憂惶之色，彷彿將受斥駡或撾擊的模樣；口唇殊有敏感，見有人以慈和之色相加便發微　：溫和的言辭立致感激之容色，令人看了甚覺可愛。當韜　說起音樂隊，裴夫人立即在他臉上見到那種急切而愉快的表情，她就對她自己說道，一這可憐的小寶貝，假如他喜歡的話，他可以將提琴彈個整天。」</p>
<p>月二十五日至二十八日、假大同大學舉行考試、各科成績、　經考試委員會評定、計錄取高中畢業生、顧曾慧談鎬生、呂保維張金堂胡聲求王承明龐心正李錫麒孟侃董瑞　錢政藩十一名、大學肄業生朱金元一名、備取楊治平一名云、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （顯微生）</p>
<p>一枝極細弱的瓜藤，却會結上『斗大』的西瓜，絕不怕雨打風吹，一株高大的銀杏樹，反只結上極小的白果，經不起一夜風雨，就要脫掉。這個，正像資財富足的人家，偏是招不大子息，生活艱難的人家，反會兒女成行。</p>
<p>商塲原似賭塲，本國人買本國貨，宛如一家門　人叉麻雀，那錢的輸去贏來，仍沒有走出大門；倘本國人買外國貨，好比是這局賭要，雜着一二個外客了！我方賭贏，那是還好，反是，豈不是這錢馬上走出大門去麽？進一步說，那賭錢還有贏的希望，這個，簡直是有輸無贏，可怕不可怕！</p>
<h3>神秘的夜</h3>
<p>— 閻重樓</p>
<p>眞像是演劇似的，正生般的「畫」剛一下塲，小丑式的「夜」便跳出來。</p>
<p>夜，不管天生它是怎樣地昏黑，但它可以用電炬的光把它裝得通明，有時候它還可以塗上紅綠藍紫……種種不同的顏色。在白晝看見面容很枯黃的女人，到夜裏也變成很艷麗的了；白天睡在床上精神很萎頓的有槍階級、（注意……此槍係指烟槍）到夜裏也精神百倍了：酒館茶寮裏招待着日裏訓誠子弟「戒絕酒色」的道學先生們，跳舞塲裏擁滿着晨間受過訓練——預備捨身救國的學士們，洋行行員商店職員那是拖着一日辛勞的身體，把一日辛勞的工資送進跑狗塲回力球塲毫不吝惜：……這些形形色色的狀態，展現在都市的夜裏：夜能帮助使人面容艷麗，夜能帮助使人精神百倍，夜能使人改變一切常態。</p>
<p>夜，眞是多麽地神秘呵！</p>
<p>但燈光在夜裏看見很明亮，放在太陽的光下就顯得暗淡了；夜裏看上去很艷麗的女人，和燈光一樣不敢拿來放在太陽的底下。</p>
<h3>拖鞋</h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>拖鞋，不論是「上等人」，或是「下等人」，總沒一個不愛穿的。更其是在這麽個暑期之中，公餘港後，覺得拖鞋是萬不可少。</p>
<p>拖鞋的面，有些是很考究的。白緞上面繡着紅花綠葉、再添上一二個栩栩欲活的黑蝴蝶兒，那自然是再也漂亮不過的。自然，有這麽漂亮的鞋面的拖鞋，穿在年靑的公子哥的脚上，是最能引人注目，而很神秘地問：「這雙拖鞋，是那一位相好送給你的」？</p>
<p>這些年來，在拖鞋面上，用絲線刺繡的，是逐漸地少了，一般的，都用梵珠穿着釘的了。也有用十字布十字線繡的，這個，我覺得總够不上用白緞絲繡的，來得富麗而雅緻。</p>
<p>但是，今年呢，一般的鞋舖子裏，都大量的陳列出了皮拖鞋來了，標着「每雙一元」，甚至於每雙八角，於是打倒白緞　花拖鞋的梵珠花和十字線花的拖鞋，十個穿拖鞋者之中，不拘男女老幼，不拘貧富貴賤，張三李四，阿貓阿狗，至少總有八九個是皮拖鞋。這在鞋舖老板口中，或可喊一聲「皮拖鞋萬歲」，</p>
<p>昨天，在某公司見到一雙高跟的女拖鞋，那跟兒足有一英寸半高。我於是不禁有些兒感觸了，我覺得穿拖鞋的本旨，原不過爲求舒適。爲求舒適而去穿跟兒那麽高的拖鞋，那眞是何苦來呢？</p>

<h3>戈林通信</h3>
<p>— 萍</p>
<p>這裏戈林，不是地名，而是人名，不是德國的戈林，而是中國的戈林；把這兩字分開來，戈是戈公振，林是林語堂。讀者應該會知道：他們一是名記者，一是名作家。論起他們的關係，是多年老友，非泛泛之交。最近爲了「人間世」一篇文章的附語，「林」有幾句話，引起「戈」的不歡，「戈」自海外飛來一雁，對「林」有所辯正，詞意幽默，特　介紹給讀者：</p>
<p>『語堂先生：別久思深，海外每以讀尊編各誌爲快。頃閱「人間世」第二十八期「記者生涯」附語，對弟有賣言，因與事實乖忤，不敢不辯，先生在出版界久，當知今日之中國報紙，尙無有如Zew　York　Times之具有世界眼光，肯斥巨資，選高才，常駐國外，尋求最新聞見者。先生在著作界久，又當知今日之中國雜誌，有取材極審愼不敢登載關於蘇聯文學者，弟曾嘗試失敗，非過甚其辭。故弟之蘇聯旅行，完全出於個人興趣，而非被囑託，欲求如Duranty之地位可以遇事直書，欲求如Duranty之報紙，可以任意揭載，渺不可得。</p>
<p>矧國內關於蘇聯之書籍已多，雖不願再爲遊記與迻譯之工作，必身親而目擊者，然後筆之於書，年來散見於「生活週刊」，「新生週刋」，「國聞週報」，「世界知識」與「時代畫報」者，曾有如下之諸篇：</p>
<p>第二五年計劃　電城　油城　鐵城和　城　豰城　所謂社會城　蘇聯的國慶　第七次大選　列寗逝世的十週年　軍隊檢閱與體育檢閱　十五年的，蘇聯美術</p>
<p>以上皆較有意義者，其他雜作未計，弟信此純爲個人努力，期對於國人有貢獻，如爲博取酬資，則千字才二三元，先生當知之更　，數月辛苦，或不足償一日旅途所費也。「人微言輕」，夫何足異，惟先生編報而不閱報，吾不能不轉怪我公矣。公振拜啟　六月二十九日維也納。</p>

<p>浣花點着頭道：再會了。這也就再顧不到攸站在這裏怎麽樣，掉頭自進去了。到了後院，遠遠就看到程志前隔了玻璃窗子向外面張望。於是收住了笑容，也帶一種沉鬱的臉色，走淮房去。志前笑道：楊小姐事後又熱心起來，少不得已經是到那裏去了一轉的了。浣花歎口氣道：程先生，你實在是個好人，我越想你的話，我越是後悔。這個媒，我作的是十二分的後悔。說時，兩手按住了桌沿，向志前望着，似乎在靜等着志前的安慰。志前便笑道：說起來呢，這件事也不能要那一個人去負責任，而况他家裏人，原也是自己願意的。口裏說着，已是斟了一杯茶，送到浣花面前。他笑着道了謝謝。就坐下來，將月英的形狀，說了一遍，自然都是在同情的一方面。後來志前說到意志薄弱的女人，末路無非如此，浣花默然着，隨着就流下眼淚來。許久，才一而擦着眼淚，一面低了頭道：要是男子都像程先生這樣的心腸，女人就走遍天下，也不會上會的當了。志前笑道：楊小姐說這樣的話，我可不放當。不過我是一個窮文人，什麽享受也是談不到的。我很知道安分守己，不敢作什麽妄想。一個人安分守己，自　就不會去害女人了。假使我有個十萬八萬，在家裏住着皇宮式的房子，出去坐着最新式的汽車，那我自然也會娶上三房四妾的。（二八六）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>它們都飛得很低，有幾頭差不多要把他們的翅膀在水面上掠過了；在我們的前面，無數的荷葉，隨着陣陣的曉屬，倏左倐右的起伏着；湖水所激起的微波，有時會把它們一起的淹下水中去，但不久它們自己又會掙扎起來了，一陣搖擺，葉上的水便都成了圓點而落下來了，在不甚明亮的晨光中，看去眞像是一顆顆亮晶晶的珍珠。</p>
<p>各人都靜默着，到處沒有一些聲音，如同在大沙漠內一般的沉寂；整個的頤和圍，不見有半點燈火，好像是它還在那裏睡着的樓樣。我們這一起人今天如此的破例早出，直像是出來幹什麽秘密工作的，想來眞是好笑。其實太后敎我們今天起個大淸早，隨伊到湖上來，究竟是什麽意思，我自己實在不會明白：別人是否已領會，我也不敢必。可是太后的神氣却是十分的安閑鎭定，—因爲伊自己原已知道將有什麽奇遇要發現了：我瞧伊的臉上委實有些神秘的表示，並且好像還在思索什麽。伊的一對眸子不是看在那一大堆荷葉上，便是抬起來望著東面的天上。</p>
<p>「大家注意着！」伊突然又向我們低聲說道：「將有一個不易常見的奇景在你們面前顯露了！當太陽升起來的時候，你們留神瞧着，那些含苞未放的荷花都會一霎時開放了！」（三八六）</p>

<h3>希特勒胞妹的孤高</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>英名赫赫，威震全球的德元首希特勒，有一位胞妹，以常理而論，她也是一位貴人。但她不作攀龍附鳳之思，却和其兄遠離，隱居在異國。這種高尙的人格，眞是時下的摩登太太小姐們望塵莫及，也許還有人要說她孤僻哩。</p>
<p>這便是波拉希特勒女士，現年三十八歲，還是老處女。她隱居在奧京維也納，愉決地靜觀其兄施展雄　偉略。她每年只到德國一次，探望其兄，也不過住幾星期便回。希特勒嘗說，若因他的「主義」成功，使親戚榮華，那是不道德的行爲，女士也極以此言爲然，眞可謂有此兄必有此妹也。</p>
<p>波拉女士常對她的朋友說：她若有一日能再自求生活，那便其樂無比了。她原在一家保險公司常個寫信封的職務，每月薪水甚微，勉强只够生活。兩年前，忽被免職，東奔西走，總不能再覓得一個新職務。她把她的姓名故意拚錯，但終被人發覺她是國社黨領袖的胞妹，他失去保險公司的職務，也因這僩原故。後來竟沒有商行再敢僱用她，所以她不得不靠其兄的津貼度日。她因依賴他人生活，很爲痛心。其兄津貼之欵，每月約六七十元，分批領取，每次約在十元左右。</p>
<p>她本住在城心一間小披屋中，很不安適，三個月前，她始遷到華赫林區附近，區內的居民，很多屬於國社黨。她賴一位朋友介紹，在一所新厦之中租得兩間住崖，另有廚房浴室，却比以前寬舒多了。</p>
<p>這新屋除每月付租金十四元外，她還補助了建築費五百元，這筆欵子，和添置些家具的費用，都是其兄供給的。</p>
<p>她雖用了眞姓名註冊，但鄰居們只知道她是華爾夫夫人。她所以要瞞着他們的原故，因爲從前住的地方，常有不速之客前來纒擾不休，故想免去這種麻煩。後來有一家不知趣的報館，把她的新住址登在報上，於是又有許多人源源地前往訪問，她不得已在朋友家中避居了一星期。她曾收到來函數千封，有的請她代投函人干涉其兄的行爲，有的是滿紙恭維，還有的是一味毒罵，這三類函件都是她所憎惡的。</p>
<p>造位總握德國全權的領袖的胞妹，家中不　一俊，一切家務，都親自處理，有時報館訪員按動門鈴，便見，位衣服樸素，形體强健，雙　帶褐色，頭髮漆黑的女子前來應門。一望而知爲希特勒的同胞。她只把鬥微啟，來客問華爾夫夫人在家麽？她便堅决地回答道：「太太不在家，不知道何時才回哩。」來客再想問話時，那門已砰然一聲緊閉了。</p>
<p>波拉女士很愛靜居，難得和鄰居閒談，平日接見的人，只有寥寥數友，兩位中年女子，還有一位男子，便是替她覓得新居之人。</p>
<p>女士每年回德國一次。和其兄相處數星期，但也隱居不出，她的行蹤，從不使大衆知道。她住在德國時，只和其兄最心腹幾位同志的夫人盤桓消閒。</p>
<p>希特勒還有一位義妹，名賴巴樞，長居德國，她和波拉女士是從不出臨公衆之前的。這種德性，眞是難能可貴啊！</p>

<h3>紗花　倉庫籌碼感缺　一般紗業依然看好</h3>
<p>紗市趨堅、蓋因金價上騰、一般同業心思觀漲、查其原因、謂倉庫中籌碼物缺乏、廠方存底亦少、至於現紗交易雖淸、暫時與南面不生問題、另一方面消息、有多頭公司組織、預備軋八月期空頭、査本月份成交至昨日截止、達二萬五千一百包、然內地方面、存紗尙有、故紗銷近兩日來、每日成交僅二百餘包云、</p>
<h3>金鷄多頭加碼</h3>
<p>標紗前市開盤、因美棉估計發表產額豐收、人心稍疲、各月均跌五·六角、拍至二三盤、聞標金堅昂、棉市趨高、致多頭活動買進、突然上漲、結果各月比上日收盤價均漲四角至一元一元一·二·三角、午後開盤忽然昂反漲、塲中賣者减少、且金市又漲、偉說多頭方面在組織、收盤愈見緊俏、市價徐徐回土、結果本月比上午收盤價漲五角、遠跌一·二·三·角、查賣出裕大一千零五十包、合興一千包、恒德六百五十包、泰昌五百五十包、大千零五六包、德記四百五十包、賡豐八百五十包、仁豐一矛四百包、買進大孚六百五十包、大豐六百五十包、明華六百包、賡豐四百五十包、森康五百五十包、愼記一千四百五十包、永昌二千三百五十包、一日間最高低價、及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>美棉報告雖增　本棉軋空心思仍濃</h3>
<p>棉市八月期獨堅、市態異常堅挺、因多頭軋空觀念殊探、且一般散戶、均在空頭地位、所以局勢奇緊、至於新棉、亦被陳棉帶起、兼之標金在九百十餘元之高峯盤旋、於是多頭意興十分濃厚、但美棉生產豐收、亦不足影響本埠棉巿也云</p>
<p>鄭標新空缺乏</p>
<p>標花前巿開盤、巿氣稍平、因美棉第一，次生產發表、額量爲一千一百七十九萬八千包、較上年同時增收二百十六萬二千包、然本埠棉市未受打擊、因一般棉商皆在多頭地位、對於八月期軋空心意十分堅强、塲內新賣者缺乏、結果各月比上日收盤價均漲一·二·三角、午後開盤尙跌一角、拍至二三盤、本月份甚挺、且標金又至九百十五元外、人心多數看好、結果各月比上午收盤價又漲一二角、查賣出大孚一千一百擔、源大一千九百擔、賡豐二千八百擔、源興昌一千擔、仁一千八百擔、元一一千四百擔、大昶一千六百擔永大一千五百擔、買進達記一千四百擔、大豐二千一百擔、義成一千一百擔、　昶三千二百擔、長豐二千七百擔、永昌三千四百擔、同和一千一百擔、新亨一千擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<p>八日華盛頓電、美棉第一次收成報吿、已於本日正午由農部估計局發表、計產額爲一一、七九八、〇〇〇包、較去年同期增二一六、二〇〇包、茲將前四年同期精形並錄於左、（單位千包）</p>
<h3>美棉報告利於賣方</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、市况平疲、各月跌四至八磅音、農部報吿雖利賣方、然市價未受影響、農長華來士聲言在市價未受棉收增加之影響、，而慘跌以前、借欵問題暫不發表、同業需要尙佳、其後經紀商及華爾街賣出、市價突跌、收盤時、因有補空及同業買進尙形穩固、計現貨跌二十磅音、期貨跌十三至二十一磅音、英棉現貨跌六點、期貨跌六至十四點、印棉初因少數歐洲出口商補進七八月期白羅溪而堅、後因多頭了結而回、四五月期上落較小、均係補空性質、計平果爾漲零·二五羅比、奧姆辣漲半羅比、白羅溪漲零·二五羅比、原電錄左、（八日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、九日四五月期白羅溪花之開盤預測、爲二百零八羅比、較上日收盤跌五·二五羅比、</p>
<h3>糧食　客戶抽進本月粉</h3>

<h3>自動音量平勻器的裝置</h3>
<p>— KMK</p>
<p>自動音量平匀器（Automatic　Volumo　Control在收音機中，係專司調理不平勻之音量者，因爲從每個播音　所發射於天空及地層間之電波，其電力之强弱每各有異，故在收音機所收得的聲音，每隨電力之强弱，而致高低不平匀，甚有兩電臺之電力相同，而音量則高低相差極遠者，前者原因，係收音機的本身缺乏平勻和補充能力，後者則多由環境的優劣，和隔程的遙近所致，收音機有這種弊端，在收聽時極威討厭，如在接收附近或强大電臺之播音，則感覺音量大，響亮刺耳，或騷擾遮蔽其他電臺之播音，反之接收遠程或弱小電臺之播音時，就嫌其音量太低微或時高時低之缺點，縱使有音量調節器裝置者，亦祇能避免强大的音量，却不能使低微者而至響亮，因爲這幾種緣故，所以收音機的在音量問題上，就有革新求精之必要，如在近年輸入吾國之新式舶來品收音機中，莫不置有斯項自動音量控制器，但其中以外差式裝置者居多，通常的和小型的則尙屬鮮見，至於本文所述的，則係設置於通常小型（TRF式）收音機中者，讀者如感到收音機的音量不平勻，大可照圖一試，好在取件簡單，諒不致威到任何困難也。</p>
<p>自動音量平匀器，係以一枚三極眞空管，及數枚耗阻器，配合而來　任的，因爲這種工作須和檢波同時完成的　故，所以採以雙屏複作用眞空管來擔任斯項工作，（見圖第二枚55眞空管）以三極部份作自動音量平勻器，兼以雙屏作半波檢波，綫路則採自　檢方式，使檢波工作不致趨於衰弱點，在外差式的收音機中，多係採用屏檢方式，因其已係第二次檢波，故不似通常者爲重要也，至於配合之另件數値，附圖已有詳細註明，母庸再述。</p>
<h3>超短波收話發話機</h3>
<p>— 芝</p>
<p>超短波，一個多麽耐人尋味的名詞，在今日它還祇是髣髴一個蘊藏豐富的寶藏，正待着人們懷抱着絕大的努力去開墾發掘！「試騐」就髣髴是唯一的發掘利器！</p>
<p>在不久的過去，美國波士頓附近的哈佛大學藍山氣象台曾與美國業餘聯合會所設於哈福城鄰近一小山頂上的電台，作二公尺半波長的通訊，試騐成功，通訊距離是一百四十四公里！打破歷來的紀錄！至於未來的發展，正是意料中的事哩！</p>
<p>同志們，本着業餘研究的精神，使命，努力去多多試騐！發掘這神密的寶藏——超短波！</p>
<p>這裏，介紹的二架最實惠的收發兩用軌，願貢獻給同志們聊作參考！</p>
<p>第一圖所示之機，用之者極廣，機內應用眞空管兩枚，收音時作檢波與低放，發話時作振盪和調幅，收發由一四極式雙擲開關管理着，——位於1時卽可發話，收話時位於2。T是特製低週率調幅兩用變　器，T是輸出變壓器　調　阻流　。</p>
<p>綫圈LLr各用十四號漆包綫繞五圈直徑五分，L2繞二團，電容器C2是三片小型變量電容器，機內固定電容器都須用雲母片絕緣式，此機在通常使用時，A處接四呎或八呎長的天綫卽可，A1是為接特製的匹卡特（Diokord）天綫用的，</p>
<p>第二圖的綫絡，是比較新頴的收發機，機內LL1綫圈，用十四號漆包綫各繞六圈，直徑四分，長度六分，C是普通抵償電容器，CH是中心抽頭的低阻圈，或用一比一低週率變壓器串聯代之，高阻　RFC，用二十二號雙紗包三分直徑管上繞六十圈，</p>
<p>收音時開關S位於2處，發話時位於1處。</p>
<p>天綫之長度同前機。</p>
<p>此樣之特點爲在發話時，調幅電訊可由聽筒PH接聽之，不假其他助調器以辨別它的優劣。</p>
<h3>電視與短波</h3>
<p>— 泡</p>
<p>現在的電視，雖然已從實騐室試騐時期進化至實用時期，但是實際上障礙重重，尙待繼續試騐，以臻完美之境。單靠機械動作的電視機，現在已無再加研究的價値，而不得不讓陰極光管式來代替。但是自然界的電視機——人類的眼睛——，根本不須經過「分割（Scanning）」的手續，而收影的淸晰，運用的便利則遠勝現在的電視機，所以未來的電視將依據一種更簡單的新發現，而得到正當的解决　徑，卽現時盛行的陰極光管，恐亦將屏棄不用矣。</p>
<p>不論電視將進步至若何稈度，未來的電視將以短波無綫電傳遞，則頗具可能性。根據電視專家的意見，現在的電視機，須有四百千週率闊的波段，（音樂僅須十千週率）方能顯出與普通書籍上照相銅圖同樣淸晰的影來。因此波段狹窄的廣播段與短波段，無法容納須佔四百千週率的電視電台，而不得不置之於波段廣闊的超短波範圍內。但超短波不能及遠，乃不得不用數十座中繼電台以資轉播；則此數十座電台，與專供連絡中繼電台用的特製電纜的設備費，足使現在的電視，播程僅及一隅，而事業亦難望繁榮也。故未來的電視，若能設法用較狹的波段播送，則將以一二座波長約二十米突的强力電台　　，以免號　多數中繼電台。</p>
<p>理想的　　有了影，還　有音，方能如有聲電影的『有聲有色』　購於此問題大　不外下列三途徑以解决之：</p>
<p>甲　影與音同用廣播　長　送。</p>
<p>乙　影用超短波段，音用廣播段。</p>
<p>丙　比較上最適　，　與音在超短波段內，同時用同一波長播送（此方法已試　成功），則接牧時可以配諧一波長，而同時收到影興音。</p>
<h3>超外差式及TRF式收音機最易犯的弊病與其防止法</h3>
<p>— 思廉</p>
<p>超外差式或T.R.F.式（卽調整射電週率放大式）等收音機，每求其發音響亮，故在檢波級後或第二級檢波後之成音週率放大，勢必用五極强放管（PoweiPentodetube）担任之，如2A5,42，41，4347等眞空管，此類眞空管所能受之屏　壓極高，其輸出亦極大，如2A5,42號等眞空管，其屏流輸出爲三十四千公安培，故必有以保誰其揚聲器。在普通收音機中常以一成音週率阻流圈與一固定電容器合組而成，惟在超外差式或調整射電週率放大式或其他用五極强放管者，莫不採用輸出變壓器，此類輸出變壓器通常都連於電動揚聲器上。</p>
<p>輸出學壓器之初級綫圈，普通以四十號至四十四號英國漆包導綫繞之，或美國導綫三十六號至四十號漆包綫繞之，所以每易焚斷。若受濕霉斷，簾柵極就易發紅，電動揚聲器所發出之音樂聲細如蚊叫，或竟無聲，或竟發生雜聲。眞空管受此巨創後，將减少其固有特性，卽修好後成績總不及原有之淸晰與響亮。此種弊病每易遇到，故不得不預防，法將其初級綫　改用較粗之漆包綫繞之。又　丙電阻損壞，亦易發生此種弊病，蓋控制極上缺少其所有相當負荷之故。此項預防法，可將丙電阻換用較大瓦特，或不用丙電阻，而將陰極直通地綫。若因　極土無相當負荷成績覺得不佳，則可將柵極電阻改用一兆歐姆至二兆歐姆者。</p>
<h3>全球收音機統計</h3>
<p>— 潔如</p>
<p>最近國際無綫電廣播局發表的年表，顯示着各國廣播事業的進步。</p>
<p>這年表吿訴我們在一九三四年年終，全球所有收音機的總數約計四八、三〇〇、〇〇〇架，這就是說至少有一九三、〇〇〇、〇〇〇個聽衆，</p>
<p>在這四八、三〇〇〇、〇〇〇架收音機中二三〇〇、〇〇〇架是屬於歐洲的，大都領有使　執照，美國　有這總數的大部份，約計二千萬〇七十五禽架，其次是英國約計六、七八〇、五六〇架·德國約計六、一四二、九二一架，照國家人口比例計算，全球要算丹麥據有收音機最多，平均一〇〇〇個居民中有一六〇架收昔機，</p>
<p>一九三四年中全球在使用的收音機總數約計三、五〇〇、〇〇〇架，裝在汽車內的美國的二百萬架尙不在內，這當然在聽衆方面至少得增加一千三百萬，</p>
<h3>簡易二管短波收音機（續）</h3>
<p>— 庸言</p>
<p>註：L1繞三又四分之三圏，每圏間距離十六分之三英寸；距L1十六分之三英寸繞L2，計六又四分之三圏，密繞。</p>
<p>裝置時，並無十分困難之處。接綫處均用錫銲妥，接綫不必求美觀，但求短直。面板最好用鋁質，膠木質者亦可。乙電接成音週率擴大處者，宜用九十弗打，若用四十五弗打亦可，但聲音較輕。</p>

<h3>中國今日的思想界</h3>
<p>— 室伏高信</p>
<p>日本評論　　伏高信最近以　　新聞社之約，來遊我國南北各地，經滬時，曾以發表對「新生』事件與中日問題的正論，爲國人所知。返日後，以其遊跡所經，著爲『中國遊記」，逐日刋登於讀賣新聞。本篇即其中之一段，閱之可見其對我思想界觀察之一斑也，譯者識。</p>
<p>一　胡適之不知當今的生命哲學</p>
<p>十七日午前、爲的想與中國的思想家交換所見，乃走訪湖適君·自文學革命以來，胡適或胡適之先生的名字，是世界的。</p>
<p>日本的知識階級諸君，大概當沒有不知道他的名字的罷·他的名著「中國哲學史大　」在日本也有了譯本·自他主張文學革命即白話文學，現在差不多近二十年了·這其間，他始終立在中國思想界的第一綫。在中國靑年當中，他的聲名，雖已不如昔日，但還是第一流的思想家，是一方的領袖，其著名之點，是中國第一的。</p>
<p>胡適現任北京大學的文學院長，同時並主編一種名曰『獨立評論』的週刊·共發行份數是七千五百，雖然不能與銷數六七萬的上海的東方雜誌相比，但仍不愧是中國言論界指導一方的最有力的評綸雜誌·我們若不提到胡適，如中國的學界，思想界，評倫界以及今日的中國與人物，是都無從談起的。</p>
<p>胡適的家在北京大學附近，當北平後門之底。汽車一停在門前，就有看門的走了出來，制止所養的犬。門內天井，廣至數丈，家中備有自己的汽車·房子是非常豪壯的洋房，就學者的生活言，是上等的，不過稍爲奢華一點。在我，若爲學者，那來能有草屋八九間，有陶淵明樣的生活也够了。</p>
<p>走進了門，從裏面出來的胡適之先生就自己領我進客室·看樣子是個白面的書生，中等身材·我不想這就是世界的思想家胡適之先生·</p>
<p>『室伏先生』，胡適這樣念着，問我這姓氏的日本讀音，接着說。。『曾經讀過室伏先生的書，但因不懂日本語，所以不能有十分的理解」。</p>
<p>「先生大名，在日本是很有名的·蔣介石，梅蘭芳，胡適這三人，在日本是誰都知道的』</p>
<p>我這樣說着客氣話，於是他接着問道：『先生現在尙抱着東方主義的思想嗎』？</p>
<p>『是的』，我回答·『在日本也有一羣名曰東方主義的反動思想家·但把我的立塲視爲與他們相同，是不對的。我的東方主義乃是從西歐近代主義的終點出發，指示着將來的世界的』</p>
<p>『是』，胡適的面色，似解似不解的，我繼續說明自己的立塲：『我是屬於自由主義的範疇的』。</p>
<p>『你在哲學上是實騐主義，政治上是民主主義者，這可不就是反映資本主義時代的商人哲學嗎』？我接着大膽的問。</p>
<p>『我却以爲不然』。</p>
<p>「我以爲所謂民主主義及獨　者，决不是　對的，不動的，永久的眞理或　式，這是　　社會發展的階段的事物，是爲社會發展的階段所决定的事物。」</p>
<p>「我的懷抱自由主義，可不是以爲凡　　　的都是好的，不過大體是英美的」。這是胡　先的答語，話說到這裏，是無法再調和了，</p>
<p>『那末國民黨呢』？</p>
<p>『國民黨也未必是獨裁主義，蔣介石當然也不是所謂獨裁者』。他的回答，好像是贊成國民黨，又像不贊成似的·要之，他是反對國民黨內的獨裁主義的。</p>
<p>從另一房間，他拿了合訂的「獨立評論」及自著的小册子一本給我，他說，讀了這些，就可知道中國與德國及意大利的情形不同，沒有獨裁政治的必要了。</p>
<p>以後，我問起中國思想界的主流是什麽，他答道：</p>
<p>『知識的無政府（lntellectual　anarchy』</p>
<p>或者如此，也未可知。日本也是同樣的。但此知識的無政府狀態中是也自有其方向的。</p>
<p>我們於是又進而論實　主義與柏格森哲學的關係，杜威的立塲，尼采的復興，人間學，以後更就梁啟超，梁啟超的立塲與今日中國思想界最着目的『中國本位的文化』，吐露彼此的意見。</p>
<p>質言之，受有實騐主義的美國哲學的影響之胡適之先生，對於在今日世界放着異彩的生命思想，是完全沒有注意到的。</p>
<p>最後，他說：「陳立夫主張着唯生論，結局不過無生論罷了·」這是對於奔騰世界的生命哲學，中國第一流大思想家之所見。</p>
<p>『如哈德加，耶士柏士等的思想，在中國沒有什麼影響嗎？但在日本，這却是思想的主流，」我這樣的問着，他說：『在中國並無何等的影響。』</p>
<p>在中國沒有什麼影響，與對胡適之先生沒有影響，那是兩件事，但在中國第一流的大思想家，是並沒有注意到，至少是還沒有十分想到呢。</p>
<p>（譯者按哈德加Martin　Heidegger耶士柏士Karl　Jaspere俱爲德國當今繼狄　泰WilhelmDilthey以後之生命哲學家）</p>
<p>二　實證的研究學風</p>
<p>十七日晚，應陶希聖君之宴。說起　希聖·在日本，知道的人或者少。他是「食貨』半月刋的主筆，北京大學敎授，著書頗多，不論就　者或評論家言，都是屬於該國第一流的人物。在五六年前，我就知道他的名字，是一個新的思想家，並且，我也讀過他的著作好幾册。</p>
<p>陶君也讀過我的書十數冊，似乎對於我的立塲能够理解的。他把其所主編的『食貨』合訂本送給我，面上寫着「偉大的社會批評家室伏高信先生』，眞不勝惶恐之至。</p>
<p>塲所是北平第一流的菜館，因爲比約定的時問遲到，陶君已早在那裏　　了。北京大學法學院長周炳琳君也在那裏，還有是『實報』社長管翼賢君。繼續來的有北京大學行政法敎授張映南，法律學敎授戴修瓚。北平大學李達君，是現代中國的醒濟擊　，却沒有來，這是令人抱　的。</p>
<p>的丯姿有　　　已故的　田杏村，也有點　　下人的模樣、　　胡　那樣才子型不同，但　他的樣子看，巳可一見就知是個篤實的學</p>
<p>我門先談中國最近的思想界，及靑年間思　的　氣。並談到一時支配全中國知識靑年的頭　的共產主義，『這是在一九二四到二七年　的事」，陶君說。『在一九二七三一年，雖然尙保着　燼，但至最近，已可銳烟消火滅了』在現今是　「本　也沒有出版了。並且，在　生之間　完全不見　　　　的　向。」</p>
<p>「說北　　是排日運　　　一個中心…」</p>
<p>「那是由於內政問題」，戴君這樣的回答·戴君曾留學日本，所以　得日本語。</p>
<p>「所謂內政問題……」</p>
<p>『那末是與德國國社黨廢除凡爾賽和約相同的一回事情，可是學生的排外熱，最近怎樣了一呢？』</p>
<p>「近來的學生已都埋頭於學問了。」</p>
<p>「對於最近的華北事件，作何感想呢？」</p>
<p>『沒有什麽，因爲我們已有過更慘痛的經騐了。』</p>
<p>這是戴君的回答。『更慘痛的經騐』是什麽呢？這一句話實含着深的意義。這句話雖不加說明，却是全中國都明白的。即是日本人，倘若對於鄰國苦痛的立塲能够具有理解興同情，想來也　都明白的。</p>
<p>在這裏，存着最根本的問題不管解决與否，人們是决不会把這一一點忘記計算的。　大的國民，對外應該寬大　是。所以自己的反省，最應嚴肅將事。我們日本人，自從祖先以來是以這樣的道德敎訓着的。</p>
<p>在我們中間，中日問題，自然地成了話題的中心。　因言語的不自由，致有不少的障碍，但是我們之間，理解很易，在並無間隔的，與理解相合的事情間，常以很少的話語便一切都　滿解决。惡意與陰謀是使國際關係陷於糾紛的　大原因，惟有善意是解决此種糾紛的最　　法。我在這裏所欲說的，便是日本與中國的有識見者應快結合起來。</p>
<p>由日本的外務省處理中日關係，即外交，這像是他們一致的希望。旣然有外務省的存在，在日本人中，怕也沒有不希望這樣的人罷。</p>
<p>我们谈话的範围，談到老壯，易经，老子與孔子的關係，道敎及懦敎的復興，很是廣泛。這些，我都不能在這裏加以記述。由我之所見，在中國的新思想家間，對於中國的舊學，似尙不能有十分的再評價，但是不論怎樣的新思想家，現在是巳對這一點有甚深的關心了。至少對於中國古代社會，因之是對於中國歷史的事　之實證的研究，已成為學界與味的中心，這是不可動搖的事。</p>
<h3>日本的普通出版法（續）（完）</h3>
<p>— 鄭宗楷</p>
<p>三　發行</p>
<p>日本文書圖畫的發賣頒布，除著作者及其繼承人外，僅限於以販賣文書圖畫爲營業的商人。通常於出版呈報終了後，經過三日，即可發行。依明治十五年十月，內務省達乙第五十五號命令所定，神社，寺院的畫像，除其神社寺院之外，禁止其出版。</p>
<p>四　關於形式及內容的限制</p>
<p>依日本「出版法」規定，文書圖畫的發行者及印刷者，應於其文書圖畫的末尾，記載其姓名，住所及年月日，但著作者的姓名不是必須要　　的。</p>
<p>關於日本出版物的內容，業止的事項，依「出版法一及「少年法」的規定，揭示如左：</p>
<p>（一）曲庇犯罪及觸犯刑事者，或救護或賞恤刑事裁判中之人的事項。</p>
<p>（二）凡在公判前，關於預審的事項及禁止旁聽的訴訟事項。</p>
<p>（三）關於外交，軍事及其他官廳的機密文書及未得該官廳許可的官廳議事紀錄事項，與禁止旁聽的會議事項。</p>
<p>（四）妨害安寗秩序及有傷風俗的事項。</p>
<p>（五）關於軍事機密，未受許可的文書圖畫事項。</p>
<p>（六）有破壞政體，紊亂國憲的事項。</p>
<p>（七）關於少年審判所的審判事項及對於少年的刑事事件關於其預審及公判事項。</p>
<p>五　行政處分</p>
<p>日本對於出版物的行政處分，依「出版法的規定有四種，茲分別說明如次：</p>
<p>（一）發賣頒布的禁止及刻版印本的沒收關於出版物之發賣頒布的禁止，日人自稱爲其本國的特有制度，謂各國罕有其例。</p>
<p>出版物如認爲有妨　安寗秩序及紊亂風俗時，內務大臣得禁止其發賣頒布，同時，並得沒收其珊版及印本。但依「出版法」第十九條的規定，此種沒收，僅限發行者或以發賣頒布爲營業者所有的出版物，倘已歸個人所有的，當然是不能沒收了。</p>
<p>（二）外國出版物的禁止及沒收日本內　大臣對於國外及朝鮮臺灣關東州等處「非出版法」施行的國家領土所發行的出版物，認為有防害國內的安寗秩序或紊亂風俗時，在「出版法」施行的地域內，得禁止其發賣頒布。（　）</p>
<p>（三）雜　出　的停止依日本「出版法」的規定，雜誌如違反其所限制　戰的事　時，內務大臣得命其停止出版。受有停止出版處分的出版物，非經過一年的期　，不得依「出版法」重行出版。</p>
<p>（四）檢察官的假沒收日本檢察官對於出版物的內容，如有揭載禁止的事項，得暫行沒收其刻版及印本，在這種場合，由印刷品的體　上，得將應沒收的部分與不應沒收的部分　為分別，並分別的分割而沒收之。</p>
<p>六　出版犯</p>
<p>所謂出版犯，就廣義說，係違反一切出版法規而　處　者之謂。本文所謂出版犯，只限於　反「出版法」。出版犯得分爲出版刑事犯與出版警察犯兩極。出版刑事犯係以出版物的內容爲其處罰的要件，出版警察犯係以出版的形式爲其處罰的要件。</p>
<p>依日本「出版法」所定，出版犯不是必須以發　頒布文書圖畫爲要件，雖無發賣頒布，而其目的在發賣頒布時，或有印刷行爲時，亦能成立出版犯的資格。</p>
<p>日本對於出版犯，不適用「刑法」的自首成　，再犯加重及併合罪的規定。其公訴時效，以一年爲期。</p>
<p>（註）日本「出版法」於朝鮮臺灣及關東州皆不適用，以上各地，均有其單行規則：朝　有明治四十三年朝鮮統監府令第二十號的「朝鮮出版規則」，臺灣有明三十三年臺灣總督府令第十九號的「　灣出版規則」一，關東州有大正十四年关東廳令第三十號的「關東州普通出版物取　規則」。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>世界的復辟潮</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>說也奇怪，近來世界復辟潮，竟會這樣澎湃起來。一會兒希臘喊着要復辟，一會兒奧國也喊着要復辟，好像復辟已成為一種時髦的政治運動似的。累得一班廢皇廢帝，王子王孫，以及貴族保皇黨之徒，大忙特忙，準備着出來活動一番，以恢復他們從前已失的舊江山。雖然歐洲這兩椿復辟運動，現時都因為時機尚未成熟，又沉寂下去。但他們復辟派，已經彼此在彈冠相慶，等候着意外際會的到來，以償他們多年妄想的夙望。</p>
<p>自然的，帝王貴族的生活，只要不是白痴，那個不願意享受？許多流落在上海黃浦江畔的呂宋人，他們現今雖然很可憐的過着異地乞食的生活，但一想起往昔的榮華富貴，他們是會恨不得立刻就把蘇維埃政府一腳踢翻。白俄的復辟運動，說不定將來也會發動起來。</p>
<p>看吧，今日有一位土耳其王孫，因為抱復辟大志，未遂，竟憤而自殺。三日哈瓦斯紐約電：此間某旅館中，有一少年自殺，現知確係土耳其前皇哈密之孫，名克林，年方三十歲，據所遺致此間警察廳長之書中所稱，自殺原因，係為眷戀一美國富家女，擁有巨大遺產，滿擬結為夫婦，俾得憑籍此女資財，廣招壯丁編練成軍，返國舉行復辟，詎知好事多磨，姻緣未成，懊喪之餘，乃出此短見。</p>
<p>邇來世界復辟潮的盛行，真是時局擾壞的一個好點綴。大凡復辟運動的發生，都因一班　孽的作祟。但若無造成復辟的環境存在，　孽也是無從發作的。像現在奧國的進行復辟，便是意德爭霸所促成的。</p>
<h3>太湖上的哀怨</h3>
<p>— 里昂</p>
<p>老是這樣憩靜的，一張柔和的容顏似的太湖，卽使昌一個風天，那滾滾的碧浪，順着風勢，漸漸而過，也不見含有一些兒兇險。連綿的山崗，近的是翠綠色，遠的是淡淡的紫色，被開掘石塊的地方呈現着虎黃，像翡翠鑲着珊瑚，天空，一塊蔚藍的絲絨似的，襯墊得格外明潔。</p>
<p>平靜而清澈的太湖呵，浸着如許光潔美麗的寶石：翠綠和淡淡的紫色……</p>
<p>另外一顆寶石是從湖水裏滾上來的——</p>
<p>早上，蘆葦染着一身水露正在風中嘮叨地私語，麻雀吱吱嘈嘈在石堤的柳枝上，東天正起着一種不平凡的幻變，當那一長疋，一長疋跟宿血的顏色相仿的霓霞散開了的時候，一顆滾圓的透明的琥珀球似的早陽，漸漸地，漸漸地，升上了水平綫。於是，大地上每一支草，每一爿樹葉，每一朶花……都濺上了生命之光輝，鴨子亦成羣的奔到灘上來找食糧了。</p>
<p>就在這樣的一個早晨，踐踏着草上的水露預備到石塘去張望一個老親的病，我的本性是怕見暮色，怕見一個病得垂死的暮年的人的。可是，受了尊長的囑咐，沒法逃脫，只得逞早去一次。這時小火輪的班頭還沒有到時光，在寶界橋我雇到了一隻渡船。</p>
<p>我斜坐在船頭上，在船尾上搖着櫓的是一個三十來歲的婦人，船慢慢的披開短短的蘆葦往湖面蕩漾，琥珀色的陽光照耀在我的面龐上，也照耀在她的面龐上，我是憂鬰的，我懷念着一個病得垂死的暮年的人，可是她也　得那般的憂鬰呵，她懷念着什麼呢？是的，我又記起來了，方才她回答我的話：</p>
<p>『先生：往石塘嗎，來回算六角錢。』</p>
<p>聲帶是顫抖而沙啞，像一架鬆緩了的弓絃的響聲，帶一點哀怨之意。我開始疑惑她曾經和丈夫鬧過嘴，或被公婆無端的辱罵？因為，在鄉村的家庭裏，這點事是極普通的，生活越困苦，做媳婦的就越容易受諉屈……我儘管這樣思忖，望着後退的灰白的長橋。船尾上的婦人卻望着我嘆息起來了。手裏的擼像要擱置起來的樣子，可是我不想同她談一句話，『你有什麼不如意的事呢，你不會搖快點嗎？』這話到喉嚨口又滑進肚去了。</p>
<p>為什麼在這生之光輝中的湖面上，而滿載了一船的黯晦的憂鬰呢！</p>
<p>『搖船的，你家就該這一隻船嗎？』我終於同他開談了。</p>
<p>『就祗一隻，我家的在的時候我是不搖的。』她眼睛裏泛着紅，陽光可泛了白，熱辣辣地炙在我頸項裏，炙在她萎黃的頭髮上。</p>
<p>『那麼他怎樣的死了呢？』</p>
<p>『病死的，前個月他發了　頭傷寒！』</p>
<p>『他多大了？』</p>
<p>『祗二十五呵，可憐他……還沒有過生日。』</p>
<p>『你自己不是三十來歲的人了嗎！』我驚奇他們不合　的年齡。</p>
<p>『那裏，糟得這樣吧了，先生：一副擔子全在我身上，家裏兩歲的孩子，瘋癱的阿公，阿婆亦是西天的太陽了！』……說道這裏，她突然住口，憔悴的臉掉轉去對着翠綠的山崗，他似乎懊悔不該在一個不相關的人的面前說道家常。她搖櫓搖得快了點。我不敢再同她提起一些什麼了。</p>
<p>船，迎着晨風蕩漾前進，滿湖的滾滾的碧浪，是那樣的憩静而又那樣的柔和，我摒住了嘆息，儘讓蘆葦頻頻向我搖頭，漁網頻頻向我落淚。</p>
<h3>大理三塔</h3>
<p>— 淡珥</p>
<p>在幽清高曠的蒼山，和柔美輕沉的　海的懷抱中的大理，四季都特具那卓絕的奇景：</p>
<p>『風，花，雪，月。』</p>
<p>把整個的大理陶醉着，像個出塵的妙絕美女，婆娑在舞，把蒼山下的人們，飄飄得幾乎大有羽化之　。而於悶熱的夏夜，大理，卻獨是個是佳的時節，夏夜的景色氣調，常使遊人置身其中，猶疑是夢。</p>
<p>晚風飄起，蒼山上的樹林更蕭蕭悠奏，碧波如鏡的洱海睡漪漣縐盪，人已經輕鬆得如覺凉秋九月，清爽異常，漫步而近蒼山麓，而登蒼山，陣陣清幽澄潔得生香的清氣，沁透心脾，連骨子裏也感舒服，飄飄望幽曠婉曲，沉秀誘人的山間而云，有如世外人。止步濃蔭下，凉風拂拂飄袖，清靈空潤，人好像頓然高大了好幾倍。靜謐得令人神盪，而飄搖無主，身心融於大自然中，不復人</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>間了·我最愛悠悠徘徊而不捨，山間沉美，天上澄淸素白，身心輕靈，天上人間，渾成一片·每謂兩袖消風，我想只有這時，才能有那種境地可言。</p>
<p>蒼山頂上，終年積雪不化，氣侯却四季如春，白雪似白雪，籠罩山上，美緻出奇，令人觀望不休·壯者或竟奮勇登山玩雪，笑語高聲，常豪闊聞於幽谷，隱約可辯，極其誘人興趣，覺彷彿迷離，又覺細緻。似近似遠。若當挽樹揚眼，俯看蒼山下，活如一副沉淡隱約，若深若淺的圖畫，一片幽美雅絕的夜色，使人辨不出何處最妙，何地最美。</p>
<p>緩緩止顫搖的心魄，細細打量·從沉淡，迷渺，鬱鬱一帶中，隱隱現出像冉冉從天降的仙人似的一個巨大的筆架，雖夜而猶澄淸潔白的空氣下，樸素，渾白，定眼注望，那種堅巍高聳的氣魄，震搖得使人心驚，這便是最奇偉的大理三塔，再逐目南去，遙遙渺渺，又突矗一支巨筆，好像緊接天上，再返望三塔，活像巨美的筆架邊，堅着一支筆，在驚嘆未止中，又會從三塔前面，近　海灘處，發現那別出一緻的玉波池，濃綠的水猶似覺盈盈然。這時會頓然如處另一天地裏，好像自己是一個藝術家，面前舖着一張美絕的山水圖畫，三塔是一個筆架，另個尖塔是支畫筆，玉波池是墨水壺，景，人，塔，畫，溶成一片了，凝神驚嘆：</p>
<p>『一副絕妙的圖書呵！』</p>
<p>奇偉的三塔，是怎樣造成的，沒有人會知道，而多大多高，也無從明白。在塔下要上望塔尖，抬頭必須抬到帽子掉下去還覺還淸楚，最好是倒下地，朝天而看。塔身高約十八層，每層都非常高，塔身的大，是要一百二十四個人伸手接圍，這便可以見到巨大的度量。每層相沿而上，是螺旋形的，最强的人，只能爬到第六層，便受不忍大風的吹倒，所以從這點也可以猜到塔的奇高。塔尖最頂是五個巨鐵葫蘆，越上的越小，有一年狂風吹下最末的一個，在地上看，是渺小得看不出，但出現在地上是幾個人拖不動的巨鐵質的東西，高有幾尺，比隻四方桌還大些。葫度在下是一叢鐵樹，嘗掉下一支小支，但落在地上，比一具棺材還大，再下是幾隻金鷄，也有一次崩下一塊金鷄脚，像巨大的葫蘆那麽大。這更使大理的人們，視爲是神秘奇偉的寶塔。工程的奇偉巨大，也可以見到中國的建榮，在久遠以前便有驚人的成就了，然而，這很少人們知道呢。</p>
<p>看着這副絕妙的圖畫，想起被國人遺忘的巨塔的奇偉，人便驚贊得好像悲壯而又辛酸。再驚顧四週，山，塔，人，似乎顫搖得使我幾乎跌下山去，呵！可贊嘆的『景物』！</p>
<h3>商業化的學校！</h3>
<h3>綁（下）</h3>
<p>— 林豪</p>
<p>『輕些兒，你們輕些兒哪！有土匪！』老主人把沙啞的喉聲低得差不多！不見樣的；好似有天大的事擔在他身上一般。</p>
<p>大家靜靜地沉默着，祗聽到唏哈唏哈的呼吸聲。</p>
<p>『砰砰砰』又是一陣急切的槍聲，老主人顯然地感到驚慌，滿臉透露着無限的愁容。</p>
<p>輕輕地我們把足部一步步跨出了大門。</p>
<p>前面掩來了大羣的黑影：老主人顫動着喉音說：「誰？」</p>
<p>走近了，方纔知道是這裏的民團：『那裏有土匪？』</p>
<p>「這邊：」老主人指了指遼遠的那幾叢林子。（林子背後便是那麽一大堆的烏黑的山。）</p>
<p>民團們先把目光轉移過去向那裏注視了幾眼，然後便把掮在背上的烏統拿下，一步步蛇行地向前伏着走去·</p>
<p>我們這裏是像永遠寂靜一樣的那麽肅穆。</p>
<p>等會兒，那邊的槍聲更是急促了，並且可以知道那是正在開火的·大家都抱着一种不平凡的希冀，祈望着·</p>
<p>一夜在恐怖的情景下度過·</p>
<p>第二天，這旅店中便聚着一大夥一大夥的人，紛紛地談着昨夜的事：『嘿，那土匪眞挺凶狠啦！綁不到孩子，便開槍把金三貴打倒了。然後便背了那個孩子溜步，可是却又給團丁圍住啦！他們便那麽『乒乓乒乓』地上起來。哼，那結果眞是誰也不會相信！…』</p>
<p>『怎麽？』</p>
<p>『孩子終於是給綁去了！』失望的大眼睛。</p>
<p>我可沒有心緒管這筆閒賬了；跳上了騾車：夫把鞭兒刺的一聲丟在騾背上，驟車漸漸地向晨光微曦的大路　去。</p>
<h3>破曉</h3>
<p>— 華木</p>
<p>破曉之前，是心情精神歸於寗靜淸醒的狀態時候。記得幼年，就曾遵奉着這個信念，當東天破亮，卽蹲坐在天階里，朗聲溫讀先生敎給的書本，那矻矻孳孳的情形，現在想來，都彷彿眼前。然這種境界，也是鄉村的孩子纔能享受到的，像上海，習慣與環境，已把晨間打退到八九點來了。</p>
<p>不能不多謝這平庸的生活環境，使我擺開上海的市居，往到這半是鄉市的江灣鎭來，而給我能在破曉之前重看到自己靜寗的心，與淸醒統一的精神。雖然年事的增長，已不復保留那年幼的狹小的境界，而是因生活的體騐，從這裏看到了美麗與醜惡的現實諸態。</p>
<p>在適度的酣睡之後，我又輕輕的從夢中醒過來了。半床巾被，覆着安詳的肢體。這時的　界，已足够使人墜入思索的海中的了。窗外，天空靜謐運朦，疎星欲睡：　牆外，一幢梧桐的黑影，點點的楞在那兒。蛙聲，蟋，與蚯蚓的長鳴，遠遠的自田畦傳來。顯得大地的平和與安謐。東邊的天空漸漸變白了。一聲短促有力的鷄唱，似已失却晌午高啼時的悠遠的韻趣，這小小的動物，也許爲看歡迎光明的來臨，脈搏正在興奮看羅。</p>
<p>閘北工廠的汽笛，已漸漸高叫起來，這一聲沉重的信號，由遠而近，衝破了安謐的空氣，而彷彿震盪着睡着的床舖。多少人帶着汗臭與疲勞，從那鐵門口吐出來，多少人又帶着貧血的手臉開始從鐵門口吞進去。這類聯想，刺激着我的腦子，使我漸漸不安起來。這時，　子　　的高叫慘厲地應着工廠汽笛，空氣然更形嚴肅緊張起來了，這混合着的聲波，蓋掩去籬外淸妙的蟋蟀的翅弦，興蚯蚓的吟唱。神經已給圍困在惶惑悽楚的氛圍裏。這畜生原也意識到生活的鐵枷，又將要給人們馱在背腰上去了。爲着生活，人與畜生都得同受苦難呀。</p>
<p>又是一陣鷄叫。震天撼地的卡車，瘋狂地打籬外的道上疾馳而過。狗吠着，迎着吆喝而來的趕市的菜販。聽着這爲生活而擠出的哀嘆，不禁使人聯想到故鄉的種菜人，他們一年到頭，也是從破曉擔起菜蔬趕到城墟裏去，換得一天僅堪，果腹的米糧；還要担負數不淸的雜捐稅賦。生活已壓得他們連趕路時　喝的嘆息都擠不出來了。</p>
<p>市街的囂聲哄動起來了，幾多奸梟的商販，又開始句那些憨愿的鄉由亟事敲詐爭持的時侯。人與人之間永遠是橫着一條殘忍的鴻　！蟋蟀的翅絃不知在什麽時候切斷，幾朶　星也經睡去。園林要的伯勞已嘹亮起陰詐的　笑，姿情地叫着；驚動了　宿的瓦雀，唧唧查查的跳在電綫上，天眞地向這初醒的大地道　早安。鷄公車咿咿呀呀的。過後，淞滬綫上的初班火車也揚　稚氣的　聲揚長滑過了。田畦上的霧氣漸漸　去。早蟬聲中，披著一襲晨衣，凭着窗欄，看鮮赤的朝日，冉冉吐出烈的金箭，迎面射來。陡地，我　受着一種內心的奮發的鼓勵！</p>
<p>大地已完全醒轉來了。光明重復照遍人間。人類又得爲光明的　住而流　汗血！</p>

<h3>不要辜負了</h3>
<p>— 小天使</p>
<p>中國兒童敎育未能普及，中國兒童敎育十分缺乏，這對於中國，對於全中國的兒童可說是件絕大的損失，的確，兒童敎育是國家基礎的敎育，它應該是如何的重要。</p>
<p>步步艱難在中國之今日，兒童未來的責任該是如何之重大，但要道些兒童們負起這未來艱苦而重大的擔子積極地培警而使他們生長一種堅强的力量是必要的吧？我們以爲這力量的長成主要的當然是他們要有一個良好的環境。</p>
<p>可憐的中國兒童大部份是在一種極不合理的生活中被傷害着，我們如果看「小天使」這一影片，此種現象會使你感受到極底刺激。</p>
<p>實在，兒童的環境决不是兒童們自已造成的，可是，他們的環境，是應當誰來改造呢？</p>
<p>我們相信，「小天使」之出演，將使天下無數父母要慚愧得流淚，同時，也會有無數兒童們的靈魂被救。</p>
<p>「小天使」以濃厚兒童敎育意味的影劇現出於今日中國之影壇，這是件極可貴的貢獻，我們爲着中國，爲着中國的兒童。對於這工作自然希望全影界努力下去！</p>
<p>最後，我要這樣說：「小天使」是爲着有子女的家庭而攝製的，有子女的家庭是不該辜了它啊！</p>
<h3>明星新片上市</h3>
<p>明星影片公司向爲人才薈萃之處，目下已經攝成而即待公映的片子，已經有如下四　，而且都全部對白歌唱有聲影片。</p>
<p>（一）張石川導演之「大家庭」，爲明星全體男女明星主演，描寫一個大家庭在社會不景氣的影響之下，漸漸陷於崩潰中的情形，反映出人心的險惡，以及大都市中種種不良的情形，應有盡有，而且　笑獨多，極合一般觀衆口胃。</p>
<p>（三）程步高導演之「夜來香」，爲胡蝶趙丹舒　文主演，其中描寫着賣花女郎（胡蝶飾）爲虛榮心所誘引而演成種種的不宰，情節極　曲折哀婉之能事，爲胡蝶歸國後之精心作。</p>
<p>（三）徐欣夫導之「翡翠馬」，爲王徵信，冀稼農，嚴月閒，顧蘭容主演，以拒毒運動爲主題，片中多偉大佈景，如離奇曲折的密室地道，矞皇富麗的新式建築等，全片充滿緊恐佈的空氣，議者知道導演武俠偵探片，原是徐先生的拿手好戲。</p>
<p>（四）沈西苓導演之「船家女」，爲高占非徐來孫敏等主演，老高在這兒飾一個工人，這再適合他的個性也沒有了，在「船家女」中他顯然地有着驚人的成績，徐來孫敏等也都有雜的淴態出現，導演沈西苓是被譽爲最「懂得電影」的導演的，在這裏，他有比鄉愁」更進一步的收穫。</p>
<p>其在計劃中而及待開拍有如下五部：</p>
<p>（一）「劫後桃花」爲張石川導演，胡蝶高占非主演，劇本爲洪深原著，（曾在文學發表）。（二）「兄弟行」爲鄭正秋先生「出師未捷身先死」的未開拍的作品，現决由程步高鄭小秋合導，胡蝶高占非等主演。（二）情書爲李萍倩編導，主演人選，已定爲胡蝶高占非葉秋心。（四）春之花吳村編導，主演人選除高占非已定外，或將「重婚」之全體人馬。（五）「新人舊人」爲程步高導演，主演人未定。以上均聲片。</p>

<h3>President Wang Cables Resignation from Premiership; National Government Sends Telegram to Chairman Lin; Ye Chucang Goes to Qingdao to See Wang's Illness and Convey Central Government's Condolences</h3>
<p>(Qingdao) President Wang cabled the Central Government on the 8th tendering his resignation. The original text is as follows: "Telegram to the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee, National Government, Chairman Lin Jun: Since becoming ill in early July, Zhao Ming has been deeply grateful for the warm regards and assurances to rest and recuperate. I hoped that my illness would quickly heal, and I could resume my duties. However, for more than a month, while superficial symptoms have subsided, the underlying illness remains untreated. Even slight mental exertion brings back dizziness. Zhao Ming believes that when he was serving in the Executive Yuan, even with working day and night before falling ill, he was still barely able to keep up. If I do not self-assess my capabilities and stubbornly remain in my post, I would not regret my personal situation but fear delaying national affairs. Therefore, I earnestly request permission to resign from the positions of President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Foreign Affairs. Once I recover, I will still go to the Central Party Headquarters and diligently serve. I am sincerely hoping for your approval. Furthermore, during my sick leave, Executive Yuan affairs have been handled by Vice President Kong, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs affairs have been handled by Vice Minister Xu. Government affairs have not been interrupted due to my illness. If there are any unfinished matters, I will clarify them upon recovery and report them. I humbly submit this. Wang Zhao Ming respectfully bows." (Central News Agency dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the telegram from President Wang resigning reached Nanjing, the National Government has cabled Chairman Lin, who is currently at Kuling, and General Chiang Kai-shek, who is suppressing bandits in Rong. The Central Government will try to persuade Wang to stay. Standing Committee member Ye Chucang took a train to Qingdao on the evening of the 8th to visit Wang's illness and will convey the Central Government's intention to persuade him to stay. However, whether Wang will withdraw his resignation is still unknown. (Central News Agency dispatch, 9th)</p>

<h3>Li Yizhi and Others Survey the Northern Jiangsu Dike</h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) Li Yizhi, accompanied by Kong Lingrong of the Shandong Provincial Committee, Yu Shufang, a technician from the Jiangsu Construction Department, and representatives from the Economic Committee's Huai River Guidance Council, arrived in Xuzhou from Beijing on the morning of the 9th. After meeting with Shao Hanyuan, they went to Lanjia Dam at noon to inspect the sluice gate and the western dike of Weishan Lake. Kong said that the Yellow River prevention conference has stipulated a specific Yellow River prevention plan, and Jiangsu and Shandong will cooperate effectively. Shandong Province is responsible for blocking the breaches to avoid Yellow River disasters in northern Jiangsu, while Jiangsu Province will guide the Huai River to discharge water to reduce flooding in western Shandong, mutually beneficial and easy to achieve success. (Special dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Li Yizhi, accompanied by two experts from the Economic Committee, one special commissioner from the Huai River Guidance Council, Kong Lingrong of the Shandong Provincial Committee, and Yu Shufang, an engineer from the Jiangsu Construction Department, arrived in Xuzhou from Beijing on the morning of the 9th. They departed at noon for Lanjia Dam to survey the situation of the sluice gate and the northern Jiangsu dike, and returned to Xuzhou in the evening. On the 10th, they will go to Hanzhuang to inspect the Weishan Canal double sluice gate and then go to Linpu, western Shandong, to survey the Yellow River breach situation. According to Li, the Yellow River prevention efforts in Jiangsu and Shandong are closely related, and each province should do its best to prevent disasters. The Central Government has ordered Chairman Han of Shandong Province to take full responsibility for blocking the breaches, and the Yellow River Water Conservancy Association will do its best to assist. Jiangsu should also not block the headwaters, and the principle should be to work together to prevent the Yellow River from changing its course. The Yellow River flood season has not yet passed, and it is difficult to predict whether it will be possible to avoid changing the course in the future. Human efforts must be made for prevention. (Central News Agency dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Li Wenzhai of the Provincial Executive Committee went to Xuzhou to join Commissioner Shao of Jiangsu Province in surveying Lanjia Dam. The dam is 480 and a half meters long. The original width of the drainage channel in the middle was 50 meters, but it has been blocked by the Jiangsu people to only 28 meters. Originally, there was no water, but now the water is one meter deep. As a result of the consultation between Li and Shao, the drainage channel will be restored to 50 meters wide. Below the dam, the Bulao River will be dredged and fortified through cooperation between Jiangsu and Shandong to ensure smooth water flow. The Hanzhuang Lake sluice gate on the canal will also be fortified and dredged through cooperation between Jiangsu and Shandong. However, this approach differs slightly from the resolution passed by the Economic Committee on the 5th. Whether it can be implemented will be determined after Li visits Han on the 9th. If Han agrees, Li will go to Xuzhou again to discuss with Shao. Chen Guofu has already agreed to this approach. The water at the Lanjia Dam sluice gate is still lake water. The Yellow River water is still at the Hengdi embankment of Jing Hill five li north of the dam, moving only two li per day. The roots of the northern Jiangsu dike in Pei County are already seeing water, one foot deep. The dike is not strong. Furthermore, all twelve culverts at the Hanzhuang Lake sluice gate are silted up. Now, the Jiangsu people only hope to restore four, fearing that more will not be accommodated downstream. (Special dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Lanjia Dam telephone: The water at the sluice gate continues to rise today, and the water of the Yan River has reached the shore. Sandbags are being used to protect the dam, and stone work is being carried out. However, the rate of water rise is still slow, and there may not be any danger. Pei County telephone: Water levels are rising on the eastern shore of Xia Town and the western shore of Yang Guantun in northern Weishan Lake, seemingly due to continued inflow from Zhaoyang Lake. Feng County telephone: Water levels are rising at Zhangji in Yutai, and flooding into Feng County is feared. (Special dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Li Wenzhai visited Han today to report on the dredging and fortification plans for the Lanjia Dam Lake sluice gate, Bulao River, and Canal discussed with Commissioner Shao in Xuzhou. Han agreed. The province's disaster relief funds can only last for three months. The main stream of the Yellow River is directly impacting the Huangzhuang sluice gate. The remaining head of the embankment collapsed tens of feet from the night of the 8th to the 9th. The accumulated water in front of the barrier is very deep, with the water level rising one city foot, posing extreme danger. Civilians from Juancheng are rushing to repair the sub-embankment.

The Heigang embankment was also in motion. The old dike in Wen County breached for over ten zhang on the morning of the 9th, but it still flowed through Qingfeng Ridge and into the Mang River and then into the Yellow River, so it did not cause great harm.

Although the Chahar Provincial Government has made efforts to negotiate, he has not yet escaped danger. According to diplomatic sources, the bandits' whereabouts are extremely secretive, but they are still between eastern Chahar and western Jehol.

<h3>Deciding to Listen to Free Participation: Huang Shaoxiong Arrived in Hong Kong Yesterday</h3>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>On the German Anti-Semitic Movement</h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>Since the Nazi Party came to power in Germany, the anti-Semitic movement has followed one after another. It had already subsided in recent years. Recently, the signing of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement has caused the movement to flourish again. This is obviously instructed by the German ruling authorities. According to German Interior Minister Frick, there are two reasons for the anti-Semitic movement in Germany: (1) Jews have a tendency to dominate in various German undertakings. For the sake of self-defense, Germans need to exclude Jews. (2) In order to maintain the purity of the Aryan race, it is also necessary to exclude Jews. The first reason seems to be an honest statement. Since the Nazi Party came to power, although hundreds of thousands of people have defected from Germany, there are still more than one million left in Germany. In this time of inability to solve unemployment, the sharp-eyed Nazi Party cannot but pay attention to this. But the second reason is not the truth. Because today's Germans are not racially pure. This is commonly known to those who study anthropology and Western history. It is not allowed to be erased with one stroke.</p>
<p>American biological sociologist Hankins once said, "A pure race cannot be found in any era of European history." American anthropologist Boas also said, "According to scientific research, there is no pure race in any part of Europe." These are all conclusions based on the facts, which cannot be compared with randomly made statements. Because today's European countries are not more than twenty countries. From the perspective of its ethnic morphology, it can be roughly divided into three categories. That is, most of those in northern Europe have blue eyes and blond hair. Those in the central part have darker colors and rounder heads. Those in the southern Mediterranean countries are smaller and more active. However, the above three types also form a complex state at the same time. For example, the so-called Aryan race, which represents blue eyes and blond hair, accounts for the majority of Germans, but it is also distributed among the Finns of the Asian race, the Poles of the Slavic race, the French, the northern Italians, and even the Berbers of North Africa and the Kurds of western Asia. The first type with a darker complexion can be classified as Slavs in Eastern Europe, Germans in Austria, people in southern Germany, people in northern Italy, and people in central France and the Alps. As for the Mediterranean type, although Italy is the representative, Spaniards, Greeks, and people in Asia Minor also belong to this category. It can be seen that the races in Europe are very confused. No country can be regarded as a representative of a certain race. Take Germany as an example. Although the blue-eyed and golden-haired Aryan type is common, there are also many black-haired, red-haired, square-browed, and broad-faced people. Then today's Germans are no longer purely Aryan, which is very obvious. How can we maintain the purity of the race and exclude non-Aryan Jews?</p>
<p>Looking at Western history, it can be seen that today's Germans are far from pure blood. The Germans originated in Northern Europe. In the 1st century, they began to develop south. At the same time, the Slavic race in the Caucasus also developed to the northwest. The southeastern movement of the Germans formed an exchange situation. During this period, racial mixing was inevitable. By the 5th century, the Germans moved south again, and most of the areas they left were occupied by the Slavs to the north, reaching two-thirds of today's German territory. This lasted for nearly five hundred years. Until the Middle Ages, the German power expanded and began to oppress the Slavs. However, this was only a colonial movement, and there were no restrictions on intermarriage between the two races. Therefore, the bloodlines were difficult to distinguish. In addition, the Slavs at that time were generally assimilated by the Germans due to their lower culture. By the time of the three partitions of the Polish Slavic, German soldiers often married Polish women. The bloodlines became more and more confused. Therefore, many Western historians say that among the Germans, the blood of the Slavs should account for at least three-quarters. As for today's Prussia, the Slavic component is even more difficult to distinguish. This is not a false statement. In addition, the Thirty Years' War in the early 17th century almost entirely used today's German territory as a battlefield. Those who came to Germany were not only French, Austrians, Swedes, and Danes, but also Hungarians, Tatars, and Cossacks. These people regarded adultery with women as commonplace. Later, tens of thousands of Protestants oppressed by Louis XIV of France were moved to Germany. Based on this, Germany had already been unable to maintain its racial purity.</p>
<p>Even considering the Jews, who are most fiercely repelled by Germany today, their blood is also abundant among the Germans. The Jews moved into Germany almost at the same time as the Germans. Historically speaking, it has been at least 1,500 years. In the Middle Ages, they were oppressed by the Germans and mostly converted to Christianity and married Germans. This movement of conversion has not weakened until now. Therefore, the number of Jews who have been assimilated by Germans in this long period is even more uncountable. According to Professor Budo of the University of California, there should be 10 million Germans who contain Jewish blood. All are indistinguishable. What Germany is using today to identify Jews and non-Jews is nothing more than (1) whether they believe in Judaism. (2) The family history of recent generations. It is impossible to distinguish those who converted and were assimilated into Germany in the past. According to recent statistics, only 500,000 people still believe in Judaism in Germany. The number of converts has reached 300,000, of which 700,000 German-Jewish mixed-race people can be investigated. At the same time, countless sexual relations have occurred between Jewish men and German women. From this, we can know that due to the relationship of assimilation and mixing of blood between the German and Jewish races for many years, there is no longer any purity to speak of. The German authorities are now erasing all the factors that constitute the German nation and only taking fragments of history as the reason for the anti-Semitic movement. Is the theory not too weak?</p>

<h3>Ross Departs Today for China to Investigate China's Economy; Brief Stopover in Japan to Inquire About Views; London Denies Initiating Anglo-Japanese Conference</h3>
<p>(London) Sir Arthur Salter, British government economic advisor, is scheduled to depart tomorrow with his wife, Treasury official Paget, and Bank of England expert Rogers on the Empress of Britain for Canada, then transfer to the Empress of Asia for China. When passing through Japan, they will stay in Tokyo for several days. According to those who pay attention to Far Eastern affairs, Salter's visit to Tokyo is only to inquire about Japanese opinions. He does not intend to have direct discussions with the Japanese government, nor does he want to submit any plans. Salter is humble and has no preconceived notions. Londoners who are familiar with Japanese matters say that Japan is prepared to discuss the Far Eastern situation with Britain in order to have constructive behavior, but they do not want to hear about the actions of holding international conferences involving other countries. (9th - Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) It has not been proposed to convene an Anglo-Japanese conference. The rumors started when Sir Arthur Salter departed for China tomorrow. As for Sir Arthur Salter's trip to China, officials believe that the stabilization of Chinese currency should be an international action. (8th - China Press Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Sir Arthur Salter, the British government's chief economic advisor, trip to Japan and China has aroused various speculations in the newspapers here. However, many people here are skeptical about whether Britain and Japan can cooperate, because it is foreseeable that Japan will demand important economic rights from Britain. However, it is very difficult to be sure whether Britain can obtain the same benefits from Japan. The Morning Post said that it is not impossible for Sir Arthur Salter to go to Washington before going to Japan, because Britain does not want to be in an opposition position to the United States. Therefore, if Britain helps China, it will invite the United States and Japan to take joint action. However, it is doubtful whether this kind of action can meet Japan's intentions. (9th - Guomin News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Recently, due to Ambassador Matsudaira's return to his country and Mr. Ross of the United Kingdom's visit to Japan, various rumors have arisen. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on the 9th to clarify the truth. The content is as follows: The Japanese government has no new proposal for Ambassador Matsudaira. According to some people, an Anglo-Japanese authorities conference will be held this autumn. This is not the case. The Japanese government hopes that the United Kingdom will have a proper understanding and realization of Japan's stabilizing power in East Asia, and is proceeding step by step. This is a fact, but the above-mentioned situation is a distorted rumor. As for Mr. Ross's visit to Japan, it is believed that he has work to do in Tokyo, but the British government's dispatch of Mr. Ross only notified the Japanese side in the name of economic survey of China. So far, the Japanese side does not think it is necessary to send an economic inspection team to China to cooperate with Mr. Ross. (9th - Rengo Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The British government is sending Ross to China to investigate the economy, and is scheduled to depart from London on the 10th, traveling to China via Canada and Japan. According to reliable sources today, Ross's important mission has two tasks: (1) to persuade China to join the Sterling Area (2) to establish Anglo-Japanese cooperation worldwide and strive to realize it. China's participation in the Sterling Area is based on the United Kingdom as the center, and the United States, Japan, and France are added as a prerequisite for international loans to China. (9th - Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding Ross's advocacy of China's participation in the Sterling Area, Japan originally opposed linking Chinese currency with the British pound and advocated combining it with Japanese gold. Therefore, it will inevitably oppose Ross's advocacy. Therefore, the British government plans to make compensatory or various economic proposals to Japan in order to appease Japan's opposition. Also, before departing, Ross exchanged opinions with Sir Malcolm Campbell, who has been studying Anglo-Japanese cooperation. (9th - Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Sir Arthur Salter, the British government's chief economic advisor, is scheduled to depart for China on Saturday, and will make a brief stopover in Tokyo to discuss general economic conditions with Japanese government officials. It is believed here that this is a preliminary negotiation between Britain and Japan, and that all outstanding issues will be discussed thereafter, including the naval issue. (8th - Guomin News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) British political circles interpret Ambassador Matsudaira's mission to return to his country as promoting understanding between Britain and Japan and realizing cooperation between the two countries. Therefore, Ambassador Matsudaira's actions in his home country and the appointment of Ross, the economic advisor to the British embassies in China and Japan, have attracted general attention. It is believed that Ross will discuss with the Japanese government the overall important issues of Anglo-Japanese relations in the world and the Far East. Although the British government is now cautiously avoiding getting close to Japan and taking the same actions towards China in order to avoid hurting Chinese feelings, Japan's position in the Far East cannot be ignored, so it is generally acknowledged that Anglo-Japanese cooperation is a prerequisite for assistance to China, which is already an obvious fact.

Hirota's purpose is that Japan should purchase more raw materials from China and sell more products in China. (9th - Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Decision: Abolish Jurisdictional Rights in Manchukuo; Ministry of Foreign Affairs Issues Statement</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The abolition of extraterritorial rights in "Manchukuo" and the transfer of administrative rights over the South Manchuria Railway (SMR) attached areas have been decided by the Cabinet today. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The abolition of the extraterritorial rights of the Empire in Manchuria and the administrative rights over the SMR attached areas will be studied by relevant officials based on the following principles, with the aim of implementation as soon as possible: (1) Regarding the extraterritorial rights of the Empire in "Manchukuo," the systems implemented in "Manchukuo" in accordance with the spirit of treaties should be adapted, taking into consideration the drastic changes in the lives of imperial subjects residing in Manchuria, further ensuring the peaceful residence and development of virtuous imperial subjects in "Manchukuo," and the smooth implementation of imperial national policy in Manchuria. In particular, gradual abolition should be considered. (2) The SMR attached lands should still be maintained by Japan, but the imperial administrative rights exercised in those lands should be adjusted or transferred in accordance with the systems implemented in "Manchukuo," considering the connection with the abolition of jurisdictional rights, and in line with the pace of gradual abolition of extraterritorial rights, considering the nature of each item. (9th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Empire's government's policy on the abolition of jurisdictional rights in Manchuria and the transfer of administrative rights over the SMR attached areas was decided at the Cabinet meeting on the 9th. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement in the form of an official statement, expressing the intention to transfer administrative rights gradually in accordance with the development and system improvement of "Manchukuo," and to support the completion of the "Manchukuo" state. The statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The basic principle of the Empire's policy toward "Manchukuo" has been detailed in the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol and the Imperial Edict on withdrawing from the League of Nations, ensuring that "Manchukuo" maintains an inseparable relationship with the Empire, achieving sound development as an independent nation, thereby ensuring the stability of East Asia, and declaring the great righteousness of the Empire's national policy both domestically and abroad. (2) However, the extraterritorial rights that the Empire has enjoyed in Manchuria for many years were an important condition for the development of Manchuria before the establishment of "Manchukuo," but this has now lost its importance. At the same time, in order to achieve the sound development of "Manchukuo," promote genuine harmony between Japan and "Manchukuo," ensure the full development of the Japanese people in "Manchukuo," and further strengthen the friendly and permanent inseparable relationship between Japan and "Manchukuo," it is necessary to abolish those rights. Therefore, the administrative rights exercised under treaties in the SMR attached areas must also be adjusted or transferred in accordance with the new situation after the establishment of "Manchukuo," based on the necessity of abolishing extraterritorial rights. The Empire's government has decided on the outline at the Cabinet meeting on the 9th and hopes to implement it step by step. (A) Special consideration should be given to ensuring that the lives of imperial subjects in Manchuria do not undergo drastic changes, and to ensuring the peaceful residence and development of imperial subjects, and to ensuring that the Empire's national policy can be implemented smoothly. Therefore, gradual abolition will be implemented. (B) The adjustment and transfer of administrative rights over the SMR attached areas should be consistent with the gradual abolition of extraterritorial rights. It should also be mentioned that it is completely unrelated to the lease rights of the Kwantung Leased Territory. (9th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<h3>Proposal to Chinese Merchant Textile Mills: Japanese Merchants Decide Policy; Advocate Free Reduction of Work Hours</h3>
<p>Osaka: The Chinese Merchant Textile Mills Association recently proposed to the Japanese Textile Industry Association in China to reduce working hours in the textile mills of China, Japan, and the UK in order to overcome sluggish business. The Shanghai Textile President Togawa came to Osaka, and yesterday, the branch of the Textile Association in China held a special meeting to discuss countermeasures. As a result, the following policy was decided: (1) It is doubtful whether the textile mills of China, Japan, and the UK in China can jointly decide to reduce working hours. (2) From the perspective of the Japanese textile mills, there is no benefit in reducing regular working hours for the textile mills of the three countries. (3) Therefore, it is a better policy to implement free reduction of work hours. The official response from the Japanese textile mills in China will be decided after Mr. Funatsu, the director of the Textile Association in China, returns to Japan. (9th, Japan United News)</p>

<h3>Further French Financial Plan: Revive Economy, Reduce Prices; Continued Promulgation of 83 Substitute Laws; Undertake Public Works to Absorb Unemployment; Reduce Land Tax, Encourage Exports, Benefit Farmers and Workers</h3>
<p>(Paris) Last night, the French government issued 83 decrees. The new laws are divided into four categories: (1) protecting investors; (2) restoring the economy, with undertaking public works as an urgent task; (3) reducing the cost of living, which is the result of agreements between the government and food merchants; (4) revising the laws promulgated in the decree of July 17. Prime Minister Laval told reporters that the July 17 decree had restored the balance of the budget and preserved the franc. This decree can help restore the economy, which is the government's main goal. At the same time, the government will complete its work and implement plans to reduce certain consumer prices and equalize the burdens and sacrifices of the people. The government will use 100,000 francs to build public works such as roads and flood control, in order to settle unemployed people. This plan will be financed by borrowing. The government will also establish a central committee to prevent unemployment in northern France, which will protect French workers by cracking down on overtime work and restricting foreign workers. The government will soon issue decrees to protect investors, prevent fraud, improve bankruptcy laws, and increase the responsibility of company directors. Import quotas will be eliminated for the same industrial products, but not for agricultural products. At the same time, state governors will have the power to set the maximum retail price of meat, and those who violate it will be punished. Farmers' land rents will be reduced by one-tenth, and fertilizer prices will also be reduced. The financial crisis has now passed, and the government will continue to work hard without any retreat, and will fulfill its responsibilities. If the people respond to this effort in a disciplined manner, the revival of economic undertakings will be possible tomorrow. At the same time, the interest rate on treasury bonds has been reduced from 3.5% to 3%. (9th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) Yesterday, the Council of State held a meeting to draft several substitute legal orders in the second batch (the first batch of decrees reducing government spending was announced on July 17 of this year) to prepare for economic recovery. These orders are divided into several categories, one of which focuses particularly on preventing unemployment. The previously planned large-scale public works program, although postponed for some reason, has now been decided to start immediately throughout the country. The cost will be temporarily limited to 100 million francs. The funds saved by each province and town due to the implementation of reduced government spending will be used to carry out local projects. The government has also decided to establish a central committee to prevent unemployment to oversee its completion. The second is to protect savings undertakings, and to prescribe strict punishment measures for those who violate credit and defraud property in the name of conducting savings. The third is to abolish the method of limiting the import quotas of certain goods in order to encourage exports. The fourth is to adjust the meat market and reduce retail prices. The fifth is to reform the procedures that hinder economic recovery, so that they tend to be simple. That is, the procedure for revising various commercial contracts should be simplified, the method of penalizing 10% of the unpaid tax should be cancelled, and the cost of paying taxes should be reduced.

<h3>Opposition to Government Spending Cuts: Toulon Riot One Night; Strikers Clash with Police; Result: 3 Dead, 50 Injured; All Shipping Employees Resume Work</h3>
<p>(Paris) Last night, workers in Toulon and Brest both demonstrated against a 10% pay cut, leading to serious riots. Naval workers in Toulon and Morillon both stopped working yesterday afternoon, so the scope of the strike expanded. The situation in Toulon was particularly serious. When dock workers and naval munitions workers in the area demonstrated together, three people died and 50 were injured. The police repeatedly tried to disperse the demonstrators, who used bricks, glass bottles, and other weapons, and even opened fire. The police also returned fire. The authorities are now taking special precautions to prevent strikers from attacking the Naval Department, with armed guards stationed outside each department. There were thousands of demonstrators, who continued to riot in the middle of the night. The police have arrested about 100 people. At the same time, patrol teams in Brest repeatedly tried to disperse the extreme factions' marches, resulting in several clashes and injuries. The Minister of Shipping has notified the representatives of the strikers that the new law on pay cuts must be applied to them, but they will be allowed to consider their current work in a friendly state, and no additional wages will be given after the deadline.

<p>(Paris) Strikers in Toulon demolished wooden frames to build obstacles. The authorities immediately dispatched a large detachment of troops to clear the narrow streets near the gathering place of the rioters. The rioters ambushed on the rooftops, shooting and using various sharp objects to attack the police. Therefore, searchlights were used to track them. Senior civil and military officials held a meeting at midnight due to the serious situation, and then transferred 200 artillerymen from Tragui to help prevent the riot. As of 1 a.m. this morning, there were still a few rioters resisting the police. (9th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) At 1:20 a.m. this morning, the authorities announced that the Toulon police were now able to control the strike situation. It is reported that in the Toulon strike riot, a total of two people died, 18 were injured, and 44 were arrested. One police inspector was shot in the abdomen by a rioter and was seriously injured.

The police authorities are able to suppress the workers. According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 68 people were arrested in the Toulon riot last night, including one Italian carrying explosives. Two police inspectors were injured.

<h3>British, French, and Italian Paris Conference: Scheduled for the 15th of This Month; Discussing the Abyssinian Issue</h3>

<h3>East African War Approaching: British and Egyptians Prepare for the Worst; Concentrating Troops to Ensure Border Security; British Embassy in Addis Ababa Prepares to Protect Nationals</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa, the capital of Abyssinia: People here were very pleased to learn that the United Kingdom plans to blockade the Suez Canal and concentrate troops in Egypt and Sudan, commanded by General Allenby, a famous general from the European War. However, according to official sources, the United Kingdom's concentration of troops is not intended to aid Abyssinia, but to ensure the security of the border between Sudan and Abyssinia in case of an emergency. In addition, the general public is very optimistic about the future of the war, but well-informed sources are deeply concerned that once something happens, Abyssinia's construction work will be halted. In recent years, the Abyssinian government has been engaged in cultural and economic construction work. The outbreak of war has resulted in huge expenditures, and it will inevitably have to temporarily abandon the construction of roads, schools, and other public works. Therefore, some people still hope that the Italian-Abyssinian dispute can be resolved peacefully. Regarding Italy's granting of certain commercial benefits, a semi-official newspaper once stated, "If Italy does not threaten Abyssinia by illegal means, but asks us for economic concessions in a friendly manner, Abyssinia may also accept its request. The matter is not difficult to handle." As for Italy's territorial demands, there is absolutely no possibility of consideration, because the Abyssinian people will never allow the government to make territorial concessions to Italy. Furthermore, well-informed sources believe that Italy's advance into Abyssinia can only be limited to the provinces of Tigre and Wogadan. If it advances further, it will inevitably conflict with British interests. (8th, Havas)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: The British Embassy has ordered British clergy and British-protected nationals, namely Danes and Swedes, to send their wives and children out of Abyssinia at their earliest convenience. If the domestic situation is serious, the British residing in the interior of Abyssinia will gather in one designated place. This plan is purely for precautionary purposes. (9th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>"Black Eagle" Serves Abyssinia: Reassigned as Infantry Instructor</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa, the capital of Abyssinia: An African American named Julian, who is an expert in aviation life-saving parachute landing and is known as the "Black Eagle," recently came here from New York and joined the Abyssinian army. The Abyssinian government has recently accepted him and ordered him to serve as an infantry instructor, but without pay. Julian claims to be an "American Air Force Instructor," but official sources believe that this is a joke, because when Julian first came to Abyssinia, he was ordered to perform an aerial demonstration. During the first demonstration, he damaged one aircraft. Therefore, the government refused Julian to join the regular army, fearing that he would damage aircraft. (9th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Abyssinian Noble Women Patriotism Demonstrations</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa: Hundreds of Abyssinian noble women, including several princesses, participated in the patriotic demonstration here today. The speakers were all impassioned and willing to help the country resist Italian aggression. All the women wore colorful long gowns, adorned with dazzling jewelry, and there were 40 white-shirted girls carrying the Abyssinian green and yellow national flag, surrounding the speakers. Men were not allowed to enter the meeting place, and were only allowed to peep from outside the windows. (8th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>U.S. Cotton Sales to Italy Refused Advances</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, official circles stated that the Export-Import Bank will refuse to lend to Italy for the purchase of U.S. cotton. It is reported that cotton exporters have received a request from Italy to purchase cotton on credit for one year, and they have discussed this matter with the Export-Import Bank. Before long, the Italian side reduced the credit period to six months, but it is reported that the bank is still unwilling to accept it. According to bank officials, the reason for refusing its proposal is because the situation in Italy is not stable, and not because cotton can be used as raw materials for munitions. Italy is currently preparing for war and American businessmen feel that lending for six months is not appropriate, fearing that they will not be able to collect the debts from Italian cotton mills within six months. The New York Sun reported that negotiations are still ongoing, but they are of a private nature and may not be published. (8th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull stated today that the State Department has no relationship with the Export-Import Bank's attitude towards not granting advances for U.S. cotton sales to Italy. He added that current laws do not prohibit the export of munitions from the United States. (8th, National News Agency)</p>
<h3>Former U.S. Ambassador to Germany Visits Mussolini in Rome; Hopeful of Being Appointed as Neutral Arbitrator</h3>

<h3>Japan Seeks Amity with Abyssinia: Ambassadorial Candidate Decided; Abyssinia Sends Personnel to Japan to Negotiate Arms Purchases</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to establish a Japanese legation in the capital of Abyssinia next January to promote amity and economic activity between Japan and Abyssinia. Foreign Minister Hirota has already decided to appoint Zhangjian Lichun, the first secretary of the Japanese Embassy in Italy, as the first minister. Zhangjian has been in Italy for more than a year and is well-versed in Italian-Abyssinian relations. The Foreign Minister has telegraphed Zhangjian to return to the country to be instructed on the basic policy towards Abyssinia, and will take office around the end of October. At a time when the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia is taking place, Japan's dispatch of a minister to Abyssinia is quite noteworthy. (9th, Japan United News)</p>

<h3>En Route to East Africa: Italian Plane Crashes; Seven People on Board Die Tragically; Minister of Public Works Also Killed; Experts Ordered to Cairo to Investigate</h3>
<p>(Rome) An Italian plane flying from Rome to Massawa in Eritrea, Africa, went missing on Wednesday morning after leaving Cairo. Several British Royal Air Force aircraft were engaged in search and rescue operations. Yesterday, the wreckage of the plane was found 12 miles west of the ancient Egyptian city of Heliopolis. All seven people on board were killed. Italian Minister of Public Works Lai Chai was also among them. According to a Reuters report from Rome, Italians now suspect that the plane crashed due to sabotage, because when the plane left Cairo, it was in very good condition and the weather was excellent. It has been confirmed that the aircraft was a Savoy-Doya-type aircraft, equipped with three engines, carrying four crew members and three passengers. After the accident, none survived. Lai Chai was in Eritrea to inspect the engineering work there. He had previously been a reporter for the Italian People's Daily, one of the proponents of Fascism, and one of Italy's representatives to the International Labor Bureau. Among the other dead was the famous East African expert Frankitti, who had traveled to Abyssinia several times, and Major Botani, a famous Italian aviator. Several experts have now been sent from Rome to Cairo to investigate the case. General Berlegri, who served as Deputy Commander when General Balbo led a squadron of aircraft across the Atlantic, is now a senior official in the Aviation Department and is also a member of the investigation team.

<h3>Commercial Dispute Resolved: Poland and Danzig Reach Agreement; Poland Agrees to Abolish Tariff Law; Danzig Abandons Retaliatory Measures</h3>
<p>Danzig: The governments of Danzig and Poland signed an agreement here this afternoon stipulating that the Polish government will abolish the tariff law promulgated on July 17. All import taxes should be paid at Polish customs thereafter. At the same time, Danzig withdrew its retaliatory plan, stipulating that certain goods can be transported and sold in Danzig duty-free. The detailed measures will be discussed after the end of this negotiation in order to resolve all outstanding issues between Danzig and Poland. (8th, National News)</p>
<p>Warsaw: The Free City of Danzig and Poland have once again reached a compromise to resolve the commercial war. Poland had previously raised tariffs to restrict the import of Danzig goods. Danzig then adopted a retaliatory plan to turn Danzig into a free port to benefit Germany. Now, after negotiations between the two parties, Danzig has agreed to cancel the temporary order to open the border and allow German goods to enter duty-free. At the same time, Poland has also agreed that goods transported from Danzig to Poland will be collected by Danzig customs, but the tariffs paid should be in Polish currency, not Danzig currency. (9th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Warsaw: The Polish government has repeatedly protested and clashed with Danzig because the Free City of Danzig has allowed certain goods to be imported into Danzig duty-free. The dispute was resolved today. Because Polish Foreign Minister Beck was on his way to Finland via the port of Gdynia, Danzig Free City Senate Speaker Glaysett went to the port today to hold a meeting with Polish Foreign Minister Beck. A protocol was signed by both parties stipulating that the Free City of Danzig would revoke the order issued on August 1 to establish a customs office in the Free City to collect taxes. From then on, goods imported into Danzig would be subject to tariffs in Polish currency "Złoty" in order to protect the Polish economy and prevent it from being affected by the devaluation of Danzig currency. As for the Polish side, the protocol stipulated that the order issued on July 18 should be revoked. This order stipulated that all goods imported into Poland from Danzig must be subject to tariffs within Poland (after that, taxes can be paid within Danzig). In addition, the Polish government promised not to take any retaliatory measures against Danzig's measures to prohibit the export of currency. In addition, the two sides will start negotiations on currency issues within days to seek a solution. (8th, Havas)</p>

<h3>Reasons for Dissolving the Steel Helmet League</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The secret police announced the dissolution of the Steel Helmet League, stating that the political work of this group in recent weeks has damaged the credibility of the National Socialist Party government. The various declarations made by its leaders and members are sufficient to show opposition to or hostility towards the government. The orders recently issued by the government authorities to the group have also been met with contempt, as in the past. As of now, those who have joined the Steel Helmet League, if they have never participated in the front-line industry, are either Marxists or members of other political parties who oppose the government. Therefore, the Steel Helmet League has in fact become the tail of the reactionaries. For the sake of national security, the branches of the group in Berlin, Brandenburg, Pomerania, and Austria are hereby dissolved. (8th, National News)</p>

<h3>Shanghai Mysterious Westerner Case: Hubei High Court Has Filed Charges Against Joseph Walton and Seven Others for Jointly Endangering the Republic of China; Yuan Shu Transferred to Hubei Rehabilitation Institute</h3>
<p>Wuchang Correspondence: Joseph Walton, the mysterious Westerner from Shanghai, was arrested in Shanghai by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for endangering the Republic of China. Subsequently, several other key figures involved in the case were arrested and transferred by the Military Affairs Commission's Executive Office to the Hubei High Court for interrogation. Except for Yuan Shu, whose case has already been adjudicated and who has been transferred to the Rehabilitation Institute, Joseph Walton, Huang Weiyou (female), Lu Haifang (male), Wang Moqing, Hu Kelin, Chen Wenjie, and Yu Ruiyuan, a total of seven individuals, have now had their cases investigated by High Court Prosecutor Shi Zhenxiang. Based on the Emergency Law for Punishing Offenses Against the Republic of China, a public prosecution has been filed. This case has attracted attention both domestically and internationally. The indictment is recorded below:</p>
<p>Names of the Accused</p>
<p>Joseph Walton, male, 39 years old, Westerner, nationality unknown, residing in Shanghai. Huang Weiyou, female, 23 years old, from Hunan, graduate student at Jiaotong University, residing at 16 Huihai Road, Nanjing. Lu Haifang (also known as Wu Shenru), male, 29 years old, from Hunan, graduate of Beiping Normal University, residing on Albert Road, Shanghai. Wang Moqing (also known as Wang Hanmin), 22 years old, from Shandong, graduate of Qufu Normal School, residing at 925 Avenue Joffre, Shanghai. Hu Kelin, male, 24 years old, from Sichuan, student, residing on Xinzha Road, Shanghai. Chen Wenjie, male, 23 years old, from Jiangsu, graduate of Cheng Lie Physical Education School, residing at 51 W鹊 Bridge Lane, Suzhou. Yu Ruiyuan, male, 36 years old, from Zhejiang, graduate of Hangzhou Zhijiang University, residing in Haining. The above-listed defendants, in a case of endangering the Republic of China, have been investigated, and it is deemed that a public prosecution should be filed. The facts of the crime, the evidence, and the articles of law violated are listed below.</p>
<p>Facts of the Crime</p>
<p>Defendant Joseph Walton, under the direction of the Third International's GPU, hid in Shanghai, colluding with fugitive Communist Party members Liu Suiyuan and Xiao Bingshi, as well as defendants Lu Haifang and Huang Weiyou, to spy on China's political and military secrets. Liu Suiyuan, working as a colonel-level regulations specialist in the Fifth Division of the Wuchang Executive Office, used his position to collect information about the aforementioned matters and supplied it to the traitors through Huang Weiyou and Lu Haifang. On April 19 of this year, Joseph Walton sent a secret letter in German to Liu Suiyuan. This letter was given by Joseph Walton to Lu Haifang, who in turn gave it to Lu Dubu (also known as Qian Zhenhua) to take to Hankou and deliver to Liu Suiyuan. Lu Dubu was arrested upon arrival in Hankou, and the aforementioned letter was found on his person. On April 27, Liu Suiyuan, expecting Qian Zhenhua to arrive in Hankou as agreed, wired Huang Weiyou to inquire. Huang Weiyou informed Lu Haifang and Joseph Walton. Joseph Walton, realizing that the matter had been discovered, immediately ordered Huang Weiyou to fly to Hankou, secretly instructing Liu Suiyuan to leave his post immediately and providing 351 yuan for his escape. This occurred on April 29. After Liu Suiyuan fled, his wife, Zeng Zhaorong, also left. On May 5, they arrived in Shanghai and stayed at the Dongya Hotel. Lu Haifang and Huang Weiyou visited them successively. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters' investigation team, in conjunction with the Shanghai Municipal Police, tracked them down. Later, Lu Haifang left the hotel and hired a car. The detectives, believing him to be Liu Suiyuan, who they were ordered to arrest, shouted "Mr. Liu." Lu Haifang, realizing he was being pursued, identified himself as Lu Haifang and confessed to joining the Communist Party. Within fifteen minutes of his arrest, he led the detectives to the pre-arranged meeting place with Joseph Walton and identified Joseph Walton for arrest. The detectives found on Joseph Walton's person several pieces of evidence, including English expense accounts for the organization from April to May 2. Lu Haifang then exposed his co-conspirators Wang Moqing and Hu Kelin, who had joined the organization and transmitted secret documents, as well as Yu Ruiyuan, who had served as a translator. They were also arrested. An English warning letter from Joseph Walton was found in Huang Weiyou's room at Jiaotong University. Because Liu Suiyuan's actions were exposed, he and his wife, Zeng Zhaorong, fled from Shanghai to Chen Wenjie's home in Suzhou. When the detectives went to arrest them, Liu Suiyuan and his wife had already fled upon hearing the news, so Chen Wenjie was arrested and sent to this court for investigation.</p>
<p>Evidence of the Crime and Articles of Law Violated</p>
<p>The facts of the crime in this case are as described above. The evidence presented that is sufficient to prove the crimes of the defendants is described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the portion of Joseph Walton: The defendant stubbornly refuses to confess to the facts of the crime, and even conceals his name and nationality, refusing to reveal them. This shows his cunning nature. However, although the defendant stubbornly refuses to admit guilt, the important evidence of his crime is as follows: (A) The defendant's letter in German to Liu Suiyuan. The letter states, "Not only should you pay attention to positive news regarding military issues, but also to political issues, especially the situation presented by Sichuan," and instructs him to spy on issues relating to Sichuan and Xinjiang. The end of the letter gives instructions regarding Liu Suiyuan's communication techniques, intending to maintain secrecy and avoid revealing weaknesses. The defendant is proficient in English, French, German, and Russian, with German being his best (see the defendant's statement on July 2). Liu Suiyuan studied in Germany for many years and is also well-versed in German. Therefore, the defendant's letters to Liu Suiyuan were always in German. The defendant signed the letter "Lorenz" (the warning letter to Huang Weiyou was signed "Roar") and had it transmitted through Lu Haifang and Lu Dubu. Not only did Lu Dubu confess when he was arrested in Hankou, but Lu Haifang also identified him definitively during their confrontation in court. (B) English expense accounts found on the defendant's person. These English expense accounts are records of Lu Haifang's income and expenses from April to May 2 of this year, which he personally reported to the defendant. Lu Haifang explained each item on the expense accounts, including codes such as "No. 204," which refers to the wanted criminal Liu Suiyuan; "No. 207," which refers to Chen Shaohan, a colonel staff officer of the Third Army; "Nanjing Woman," which refers to Huang Weiyou; and "Banker's Daughter," which refers to Jiang Junyu. Also found was a small envelope containing four items of English notes: 1. A letter about an appointment with a famous woman; 2. Accounts for April to May 2; 3. A letter from No. 204; 4. The address of a Sichuan person. The "famous woman" refers to the famous woman listed in the English expense accounts as receiving a silver dollar payment. "Accounts for April to May 1" refers to the aforementioned English expense accounts. "No. 204" refers to Liu Suiyuan, who is listed as No. 204 in the English expense accounts. "Sichuan Person" refers to Hu Kelin, who is listed in the English expense accounts as a Sichuan person. This note can be confirmed by the English expense accounts. The defendant's crime can be seen from this one aspect. In addition, there was an English typed letter regarding the suppression of bandits in Guizhou, Sichuan, Xiangxi, and Exi, and a Russian typed letter dated March 27 of this year, signed "Yarting," stating, "We are not completely satisfied with Pan Fei'er. He is often deceived by information peddlers, and the sources of the materials collected by the information peddlers are mostly hearsay and completely incorrect." These are clearly related to spying on military and political secrets. Other evidence, such as Lu Haifang's statement about the important mailbox at 2018, is sufficient ironclad proof of the defendant's crime. (C) The defendant's English warning letter to Huang Weiyou. This letter was given by the defendant to Lu Haifang to be delivered to Huang Weiyou on April 12 of this year. The contents promote the importance of the proletarian revolution, the strict organization of the party, and encourages her to embrace the determination to sacrifice and fight to become a powerful soldier. This letter was found by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters in Huang Weiyou's room and was confirmed by Huang Weiyou and Lu Haifang. Based on the above evidence, the defendant Joseph Walton directed Liu Suiyuan, Chen Shaohan, and Communist Party members Lu Haifang, Huang Weiyou, and other high-ranking officials of the Chinese Bandit Suppression Organization to spy on political and military secrets and supply them to traitors, which constitutes a violation of Article 5, Section 2 of the Emergency Law for Punishing Offenses Against the Republic of China.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the portion of Huang Weiyou: The defendant joined the Communist Youth League in 1926. In 1927, she worked in the Women's Department of Nanxian County, Hunan. In September of last year, she was introduced by Liu Suiyuan to Xiao Bingshi, and then by Xiao Bingshi to Joseph Walton, to serve as a translator of various military and political news and to handle transportation, under the direct command of Joseph Walton. When Liu Suiyuan was a compiler in the Ministry of Interior, the materials he supplied to the Communist Party were transmitted by the defendant. She also used her classmate Jiang Junyu as an intelligence receiving agency. When Liu Suiyuan's case was exposed, she flew from Shanghai to Hankou to urge Liu to flee quickly to avoid arrest. Shortly after, Liu's wife, Zeng Zhaorong, fled to Shanghai. The defendant hid Zeng Zhaorong from the Dongya Hotel to another place. All of these facts have been confessed by the defendant and confirmed by the English warning letter from Joseph Walton found in her room by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, as well as the "Report of the Central Executive Committee and the People's Committee of the Pseudo-Chinese Soviet Republic on the Second National Soviet Congress" and various reactionary publications. In the English expense accounts found on Joseph Walton's person, items 18, 25, and 26 list payments of silver dollars to a "Nanjing Woman," which is the defendant's code name. Thus, her joining the organization and engaging in work is very clear. Her actions, according to Article 11, Article 28, Article 56 of the Criminal Law, constitute a violation of Article 5, Section 2 of the Emergency Law for Punishing Offenses Against the Republic of China.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the portion of Lu Haifang: The defendant joined the Communist Party organization in 1927 while working in the Political Department of the 11th Army. Around July of last year, he met Xiao Bingshi through the introduction of Zhang Fangzhi. From then on, he became close to Joseph Walton and was responsible for translating and transmitting various military and political secrets. Since December of last year, the defendant has been responsible for handling the payment of funds for the organization. The importance of his work is self-evident. His actions constitute a violation of Article 5, Section 2 of the Emergency Law for Punishing Offenses Against the Republic of China. However, when the detectives tracked and arrested him at the Dongya Hotel on May 5 of this year, they thought the defendant was the wanted criminal Liu Suiyuan and did not know that he was Lu Haifang, nor did they know who Lu Haifang was. They were even more unaware of whether he had a significant relationship with the case or any criminal behavior. However, the defendant resolutely surrendered himself, admitted that he was Lu Haifang, and clearly stated the criminal facts of the past and his relationship with the case. He immediately led the detectives to Fuxu Road to arrest the main criminal Joseph Walton and several other co-conspirators to show his sincerity in surrendering. As a result, a large number of reactionary documents and various evidence were seized. The breakthrough of the entire case was due to the defendant's change of heart. This situation is in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of the Implementing Regulations of the Emergency Law for Punishing Offenses Against the Republic of China and Article 3 of the Communist Self-Surrender Law.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the portions of Wang Moqing and Hu Kelin: Wang Moqing, also known as Wang Hanmin, was introduced to Lu Haifang by Yang Zhuo. His task was to make contacts, collect materials, and serve as a courier for transmitting secret documents, i.e., the "Second Radio Operator" referred to in items 7, 9, 21, 48, and 49 of the English expense accounts. According to the defendant's confession, "I went to Hankou once in March of this year to deliver a letter from Lu Haifang to Liu Suiyuan. Liu also wrote a reply and gave it to me to take to Lu Haifang. I know Hu Kelin, who was also introduced by Lu Haifang. He (referring to Hu Kelin) cut out newspaper clippings about military news and sent them to Lu Haifang, three times a week. Monthly living expenses were always less than 45 yuan and were not fixed" (see the investigation record of July 29 of this year). The defendant Hu Kelin is the "Sichuan Person" listed in the English expense accounts as receiving 80 yuan for four months of living expenses. According to the defendant's confession, "I met Lu Haifang in February of this year through the introduction of Ren Yue. When Mr. Ren introduced us, he said that he had a friend who wanted to study politics and economics and asked me to collect materials for him and sometimes transmit letters. The materials I collected concerned politics, namely, the Sino-Japanese problem, the problem between the Central Government and the Southwest. Regarding military affairs, I collected important news about bandit suppression. The materials were originally sent to Mr. Wu (i.e., Lu Haifang), but later they were sent to Mr. Ye, i.e., this Mr. Wang (referring to Wang Moqing)" (see the investigation record of July 29 of this year). When questioned, Lu Haifang also stated that Wang Moqing and Hu Kelin were responsible for transmitting military and political secrets. The defendants Wang Moqing and Hu Kelin, according to Article 11, Article 28, and Article 56 of the Criminal Law, jointly committed the crime of violating Article 5, Section 2 of the Emergency Law for Punishing Offenses Against the Republic of China.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding the portion of Yu Ruiyuan: The defendant and the Communist Xiao Bingshi were classmates at Zhijiang University in Hangzhou. Through the introduction of Xiao Bingshi, he met Lu Haifang and was responsible for translating materials, the sources of which were magazines, newspapers, printed matter, etc. The content was military and political news. His monthly salary was 100 yuan. From January to early April, he received a total of 300 yuan. According to the defendant's confession, in early April, he felt it was dangerous and abandoned it, returning to his position as director of registration at Shanghai University. The defendant served as a translator for a long time and was friendly with the wanted Communist criminal Xiao Bingshi. It is difficult to deny that he was unaware of the organization's spying on military and political secrets and to disclaim responsibility. His actions, according to Article 11 and Article 30 of the Criminal Law, constitute a violation of Article 5, Section 2 of the Emergency Law for Punishing Offenses Against the Republic of China. However, according to Lu Haifang's statement, "Yu Ruiyuan has no political connections and was completely forced by circumstances" (see the investigation record of July 30 of this year). Considering the reasons for his crime, there are still grounds for leniency.</p>
<p>(6) Regarding the portion of Chen Wenjie: The defendant's brother, Chen Wenlu, brought the wanted criminal Liu Suiyuan and his wife, Zeng Zhaorong, to his home in mid-May of this year and hid them. Liu Suiyuan, fearing being discovered due to the presence of many detectives, fled to Taiyuan with Chen Wenlu after three days. His wife, Zeng Zhaorong, hid in the defendant's home for more than ten days before escaping when detectives came to arrest her. During that time, Chen Wenlu asked Chen Wenjie to exchange 800 yuan of remittance for Liu Suiyuan, which the defendant secured through a guarantor. Later, Zeng Zhaorong planned to escape from Suzhou to Jinan, and Chen Wenjie was given 170 silver yuan by Chen Qi'ing to buy train tickets to Jinan for both of them. The defendant was arrested while about to purchase the tickets. From various sources, it is clear that the defendant knew that Liu Suiyuan and his wife had committed a crime and were trying to escape. Knowing that they were traitors, he hid them without reporting them, which constitutes a violation of Article 4 of the Emergency Law for Punishing Offenses Against the Republic of China.</p>
<p>In conclusion, combining Article 1 of the Implementing Regulations of the Emergency Law for Punishing Offenses Against the Republic of China, Article 230, Section 1, and Article 243 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public prosecution is filed. Respectfully submitted to the Criminal Division of this Court. Prosecutor Shi Zhenxiang (sealed), (8th)</p>
<h3>Southern Fujian Hurricane Rain: Quanzhou's Flood Catastrophe</h3>
<p>—Unprecedented in Hundreds of Years—</p>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: The severe storm and heavy rain on July 23rd caused significant damage in the Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and Yongchun areas. Transportation was fully restored on the 27th. However, only three days later, a second hurricane landed in the Xiamen, Zhangzhou, and Quanzhou areas on the morning of the 30th, accompanied by heavy rain, continuing for two days and nights. As of the 1st of this month, the rain was still intermittent. The intensity and duration of the storm were far greater than the first one. On the 30th, transportation between Xiamen and Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, was again completely cut off. Telegraph and telephone lines were all disrupted. Telephone lines between Zhangzhou and Xiamen were restored on the night of the 30th. On the 2nd, the wind subsided, and ships arrived in Quanzhou, but land transportation remained disrupted until the 3rd.</p>
<p>In Quanzhou, from 2:00 AM on the 30th, hurricane-force winds and torrential rain continued throughout the day. In the evening, flash floods erupted in the east and west streams of Nanan, rushing towards Quanzhou city. The sea tide was also driven into the harbor by the hurricane, causing the water to be unable to drain. The mountain torrents poured into the city, causing a severe flood disaster. Eighty percent of the entire city was submerged. Sixty to seventy villages in the suburbs were completely flooded. The total estimated loss is no less than three million yuan. The largest flood record in Quanzhou city was June 1st, thirty-one years ago (Ji Si year). This flood was more than three feet higher, truly unprecedented in hundreds of years. From the morning of the 30th until 2:00 PM, the floodwaters entered the city, submerging eighty percent of the entire city. At 3:00 PM, the high tide reached the Quanzhou Yongchun Pharmacy entrance above the Kouzhang Alley entrance on the middle section of Zhongshan Road (South Street), from south to north. The water depth behind the South Gate Houshan was about thirteen feet. The Fumei and Customs Jubao Street areas were about nine feet deep. Yudiantou was fourteen feet high. The depth of water in Forts 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 varied between thirteen and fourteen feet. Yiquan Garden Head was thirteen feet deep. The road from Yiquan Great Barrier Gate to Shuimen Alley entrance was about eight feet deep. The roads at Huaqiaoting, Pangongkou, and Zhuangfu Alley entrance were? eight to nine feet deep. North of Zhuangfu Alley entrance to Zhenfu Alley entrance, the ground was more sloped, and the depth varied, averaging about five feet. The water's tail reached Qiucuo Alley entrance near the top of the Shizi Street. West of Nanmalu, the low-lying areas of Xinmen Street were more than eight feet deep, Houcheng was five feet deep, Zhuangfu Alley was more than nine feet deep, Jinyu Alley was more than five feet deep, Maxia Alley was more than nine feet deep, the ditch was about thirteen feet deep, the entrance of Shuixian Temple was more than thirteen feet deep, Hua Alley was more than eight feet deep, Xiaohuangmen was more than nine feet deep, Xucuo Courtyard was eight feet, Xinluting and the ancient Rong Palace entrance were about nine feet. The section from Ximen Fengsheng to the city gate was thirteen feet deep, with the water surface almost level with the eaves. East of Nanmalu, the water depth in Tumen Street was seven feet. Daxixi Alley, Xiaoquanjian Alley, Chengtian Alley, Zhenfu Alley, Furen Alley, Yuxi Alley, etc., had varying depths of eight to nine feet to three to four feet. Other large and small alleys from Xinmen Street to West Street were also mostly flooded, with varying depths. Those on higher ground were spared. The villages such as Duansihu outside Ximen were completely submerged, with the water level equal to the rooftops, and the rooftops submerged daily. At the foot of the North Gate, the water was more than fourteen feet high. The nearby suburbs of Puming, Tian'an, Puren, Huayuantou, Tianbian, Tanwei, and Majiaopu were all flooded. From the 31st to the 1st, transportation was cut off. In the suburbs near Xinmen, the areas near the floating bridge and Huazhou in Dongmen, Dongbi, Caigongzhou, Pukou, and villages along the stream were a vast expanse. The villages of Jintoupou, Dahuan, Wuzhou, Houhuan, Hunei, and Dongwei outside Tumen were flooded to depths of five to six feet. Chenzhou, due to its low-lying location, had water reaching the rooftops.</p>
<p>On the 31st, the southeast wind had become gentle, with only intermittent showers. The sea tide also receded. After 4:00 PM, the water level began to drop. At 7:00 AM on the 1st, the water's tail receded to the Zhenfu Alley entrance on Zhongshan Road. After noon, all the roads on Zhongshan and the branch roads of Nanmen, except for the section from Huaqiaoting to Quanzhou Theater, where the water was inches deep, all revealed the road surface. It is estimated that transportation on the entire Zhongshan Road was restored after 10:00 AM. The floodwaters had completely receded overnight, but the alleys and ditches on the east side of Zhongshan Road were relatively low-lying and blocked, preventing water from draining. The alleys on the west side of Zhongshan South Road, being near the stream, would take one or two days to subside. In the suburbs, the areas outside Ximen and Beimen were still flooded, while Dongmen and Nanmen had receded. On the 2nd, Quanan cars only reached the Dongshan area, three miles outside Nanmen, from Anhai. From there, only small boats were relied upon for transportation to the city. The Fuzhou-Xiamen telegraph and telephone lines were cut off outside Quanzhou city. As of the 3rd, they had not been repaired. Currently, the Xiamen telegraph line only reaches Tong'an, and everything to the north is impassable.</p>
<p>On the 1st, all sectors of Quanzhou held an emergency meeting, attended by the Jinjiang County Government, the 9th Division Headquarters, the Jinjiang County Party Department, etc. County Magistrate Yu Gongwu presided over the meeting. It was decided to establish the Jinjiang All Circles Flood Relief Committee and to provide immediate relief by distributing steamed buns in the disaster areas for a provisional three days. It was also decided to set up shelters and use the county's original grain reserve savings of 5,000 yuan as collateral to borrow 3,000 yuan from the Bank of China for one month, with donations from all sectors to be used for repayment. On the other hand, a telegram was sent to the provincial government, requesting the Provincial Relief Committee to quickly handle emergency relief, as there are currently tens of thousands of displaced men and women in the disaster area, with thousands homeless.</p>
<p>According to Quanzhou news on the 3rd, the floodwaters in the city receded completely on the 1st. In the suburbs, the waters had not completely receded as of the 3rd, but the water was not very deep, and travel between the city and the countryside was possible. As of the 3rd, it was discovered that more than 700 houses had collapsed in the city, and more than 600 houses had collapsed in the suburban towns of Fuqiao and Xinmen, totaling more than 1,400 houses. As of the 3rd, the death toll was approximately 100. On the morning of the 31st, many corpses drifting from upstream were discovered in the Northwest Town in the suburbs.</p>
<p>The disaster in Nanan was more severe than in Jinjiang, and the affected area was even larger. The Honglai Wharf and the banks of the Zhiwei Stream, stretching over a hundred miles, were completely flooded. In Honglai Meirong village alone, 104 houses collapsed, and the water level was four to five feet higher than in the Ji Si year of thirty-one years ago. These hundred miles of farmland and villages were completely submerged. In the Yunwei area, the water had completely receded on the 31st, but the villages along the stream at the wharf were still a vast expanse. The water depth in the villages of Jintoupou, Dahuai, Wuzhou, Houhuan, Hunei, and Dongwei outside Tumen varied from five to six feet. In Chenzhou, due to its low-lying location, the water had already reached the rooftops.</p>
<p>On the 31st, the southeast wind had eased, with only intermittent showers. The sea tide had also receded. By 4:00 PM, the water level had started to drop. At 7:00 AM on the 1st, the water's tail had receded to the Zhenfu Alley entrance on Zhongshan Road. After noon, all the roads on Zhongshan and the branch roads of Nanmen, except for the section from Huaqiaoting to Quanzhou Theater, where the water was inches deep, had road surfaces visible. It is estimated that transportation on the entire Zhongshan Road was restored after 10:00 AM. The floodwaters had completely receded overnight, but the alleys and ditches on the east side of Zhongshan Road were relatively low-lying and blocked, preventing water from draining. The alleys on the west side of Zhongshan South Road, being near the stream, would take one or two days to subside. In the suburbs, the areas outside Ximen and Beimen were still flooded, while Dongmen and Nanmen had receded. On the 2nd, Quanan vehicles only travelled from Anhai to the Dongshan area, three miles outside Nanmen. From there, only small boats were relied upon for transportation to the city. The Fuzhou-Xiamen telegraph and telephone lines were cut off outside Quanzhou city. As of the 3rd, they had not been repaired. Currently, the Xiamen telegraph line only reaches Tong'an, and everything to the north is impassable.</p>

<h3>Hebei Province: Rapid Rise in River Levels</h3>
<p>The disaster in southern Hebei is even worse than last year. The situation on the Taihang Dyke turns from critical to stable.</p>
<p>Baoding Dispatch: This year, the Yellow River flood has affected the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. The disaster situation in the three counties of Changyuan, Puyang, and Dongming in southern Hebei is even worse than last year. The people have suffered from years of successive disasters, and the tragic situation has reached its extreme. The provincial government has repeatedly received reports of disaster conditions from various counties, all requesting relief funds. Provincial Chairman Shang Zhen telegraphed the Central Government, earnestly requesting that the Central Government consider the financial difficulties of the people of Hebei Province and provide special relief. He also sent the Director of the Department of Construction, Lü Xian, to Beijing and Shanghai to meet with Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi and Central Government officials to state the serious disaster situation in the province and the emptiness of the provincial treasury. Lü has now returned to Baoding. It is said that the Central Government is currently making overall plans for disaster relief, and Hebei's disaster relief is also included in the plans. The province only hopes that the Central Government will have a plan soon, so that hundreds of thousands of disaster victims can have hope of surviving.</p>
<p>The Taihang Dyke, which is crucial to the lifeline of Hebei Province, was in an extremely critical situation due to the impact of the water. Recently, under the supervision of the Department of Construction, various counties along the dyke have made desperate efforts to protect it, and the situation has turned from critical to stable. It has been found that the Taihang Dyke is currently divided into three sections for protection. Each section is headed by a local leader who is stationed on the dyke to direct the dyke protection. There are a total of 2,200 strong men protecting the dyke, stationed in sections. The first section, from Heyang Village in the east to Zhuzhuang Village in the west, has 720 strong men. A mat shed is built every half mile, with ten strong men inside at all times, patrolling day and night. In case of emergency, the strong men from each group will go to the dyke in unison. If there are not enough, strong men from villages more than ten miles away from the dyke will be gathered to increase the number. All strong men protecting the dyke on weekdays are recruited from villages within ten miles of the dyke according to land taxes. The second section, from east of the dike to Sundong Village in the west, has 680 strong men. The third section, from east of the Sanyi Dyke to west of Chang Village, has 800 strong men. In the event of heavy rain or a sudden rise in water levels, gongs will be sounded immediately to gather the masses to desperately protect the dyke. Recently, 1,500 strong men from villages outside the Beida Dyke and north of the Taihang Dyke have been called to the dyke to both engage in rescue and repair work, so it is fortunate that a temporary solution has been found.</p>
<p>Since the Yellow River overflowed, Changyuan County has also been affected by continuous gales and torrential rains, resulting in massive flooding in various places along the riverbank. The Yanggeng Dam was flooded, and thirteen zhang in the middle of the stone dam were washed away, with a width and depth of four to five feet. The rear of the western slope face embankment was also washed away by four to five zhang. Due to the vastness of the water, there is no accurate statistics of the damaged and incomplete parts of the dyke body. Recently, the water level inside the dyke has dropped by three feet, and the villagers are guarding it day and night. However, the situation is still worrying due to the seepage and waterlogging in various places along the riverbank. In Puyang County, due to flash floods in the mountains upstream of the Yellow River, the river water rose sharply, and the north dyke collapsed in more than twenty places. More than 120 villages inside the dyke, with more than 4,000 hectares of land and more than 50,000 households, all saw their houses, utensils, and livestock swept into the river. Approximately 25,000 people have drowned. The young and strong who escaped are now sleeping on the dyke, crying for food. Recently, continuous heavy rains have caused uncontrolled flooding. Eighty villages south of the Jindike have also suffered a catastrophe. Green seedlings in the fields have all been submerged in the vast ocean. The last hope for the disaster victims has been cut off. The people cannot even find rotten floc or stale grain to eat. Since the Yellow River flooded, the water in Dongming County has flowed backwards, with the water level equal to the dyke, two feet higher than last year's water level. Residents of villages inside the dyke have been unable to escape and are trapped in the water. Furthermore, the north wind has made the water more turbulent, and the south bank of the dike is in imminent danger. The 15th, 18th, and 20th embankments of the third section of the county are all leaking water and being scoured with deep trenches, which is extremely dangerous. The water is turbulent, and the embankment slope is being eroded, and the dyke root is also being hollowed out, causing the river water to penetrate and the dyke body to collapse. The water has overflowed again, and efforts are underway to rescue the disaster victims from danger. The Daqing River's water level has also risen sharply recently. Zhang Zhishi, director of the Daqing River Conservancy Bureau, telegraphed the provincial government, reporting that continuous heavy rains are causing the water level to continue to rise, and he is ordering the boatmen in various sections to step up their protection efforts. The South Canal has become even more turbulent and dangerous due to recent surges and continuous rain. The first, second, and third sections of the canal have all reached a critical stage, with the water level only a foot away from the bank. Jiang Yankun, director of the canal's conservancy bureau, specially came to the province yesterday to report on the canal situation and request instructions on flood prevention matters. It is said that if the canal continues to rise, the embankments are in danger of collapsing. The Department of Construction has specially ordered the directors of the Daqing and South Canal conservancy bureaus to take proper protective measures and report the water situation at any time.</p>
<p>Due to sudden torrential rains in the upper reaches of the Yongding River, flash floods have occurred, and the water level has risen sharply by about seven Chinese feet, and the water color has turned yellow, and the flow is extremely turbulent. The water level has not dropped in recent days and is still at nine meters. Within the territory of the North Fourth Section, embankment erosion and hidden movements have been continuously discovered, resulting in a very dangerous situation.</p>
<p>Wang Dingkui, the manager of the Fuyang River in southern Hebei, telegraphed the Department of Construction today to report that the river's water level had risen sharply due to continuous heavy rains and flash floods in the upper reaches. The river water at Yanjian Village in Cixian County was full, and the water level was higher than the river dyke, causing it to overflow for two to three days. As a result, more than twenty villages along the river in Handan County, including Liuzhuang, Zhangzhuang, Gaozhuang, Gongzhuang, Zuoxi Village, Nanbao Village, Dabao Village, Zhongbao Village, Wangqiebao, Junshibao, Zhangshi, etc., were submerged. The bridges on the Fuyang River are low, the water is shallow, and navigation has also been suspended. (August 6th)</p>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>The department issues an electric order to protect the seawall</p>
<p>Several sections of the seawall in this county near Jinshanwei are in danger. County Magistrate Jin, along with Xu Mojia, head of the Construction Section, have repeatedly planned repairs and prepared a budget to be submitted to the province for approval. Recently, during the typhoon season, seawall work is very important. Shen Baixian, Director of the Provincial Construction Department, telegraphed the county magistrate yesterday, stating that the seawalls of the four counties of Baoshan, Taicang, Songjiang, and Changshu are very important. Before the last big storm, each county was instructed to rush to prepare for protection on file. During the flood season, typhoons often occur, and the situation is dangerous. It is urgently telegraphed to the county magistrate to quickly inspect the area, strengthen the protection of the seawalls in the county, and quickly appoint construction personnel to supervise the seawall patrolmen to be stationed in the dangerous sections. The patrol situation should be reported to the Jiangnan Water Conservancy Engineering Office by express mail or telegram on a daily basis, and the names of the construction personnel assigned to the seawall should be reported first. At the same time, necessary materials should be quickly collected and stored for emergency rescue, and the dyke wardens should be strictly ordered to quickly repair the leaks. He should also adhere to the Jiangnan Water Conservancy Engineering Office for thorough handling and not be negligent. On the same day, the Water Conservancy Engineering Office also ordered Deputy Engineer Wang Zuorui to come to Songjiang to investigate. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Jin has already ordered patrolman Yang Yongnian to handle the matter seriously.</p>
<p>The detective team catches bandits</p>
<p>Recently, robberies have occurred frequently in Punan. Yang Shijie, captain of the detective team of the County Public Security Bureau, led his detectives to investigate. At about 6:00 AM on the 8th, while passing through Zhangzegang, they caught sight of two men covered in mud, holding clothing packages, and looking flustered. They immediately ordered them to stop and subjected them to inspection. A pistol, more than ten bullets, and men's and women's clothing were found on one of the men, clearly not good people. They were immediately arrested and taken back to the bureau for interrogation and investigation.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Companions' trip to Suzhou leads to bloodshed</p>
<p>Chen Baolian, who lives at Xinmatou outside Dadongmen in Shanghai, came to Suzhou with her friend Gu Azhen and others to play the day before yesterday. After arriving in Suzhou, at about 9:00 PM, they took a car to the airplane field outside Panmen to cool off. At about 12:00 AM, Gu asked Chen for eleven yuan, but Chen refused, leading to a conflict. Gu then pulled out a small knife and stabbed Chen Baolian three times in the throat, chest, and shoulder. Chen immediately fainted and fell to the ground. Gu then robbed Chen of the money and abandoned Chen in a ditch before escaping. After a while, Chen regained consciousness slightly, and it was already dawn. She then reported to the Guoxiang Street police station, who sent her to the General Bureau and then to the hospital for treatment. Meanwhile, the search for the assailant continues. It is reported that Chen's injuries are very serious and may be life-threatening.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>The Construction Bureau rectifies vehicle licenses</p>
<p>Since the transfer of licenses for bicycles and self-use rickshaws in this county to the Construction Bureau, Director Zhang Fulin has repeatedly planned rectifications. On one hand, he has dispatched vehicle management personnel to conduct strict inspections to prevent unlicensed vehicles from driving privately. In the past six months, the number of vehicles registered for licenses has increased dramatically, and the appearance of the city has gradually become more orderly. It is now learned that Director Zhang, in view of the recent increase in the number of vehicles for private use by civilians, and the fact that there are still a small number of vehicles without licenses, has dispatched vehicle management personnel to continue the inspection, aiming to achieve the goal of one vehicle, one license.</p>
<p>The Second District Games are held in Wuxi</p>
<p>The Second District Games were designated by the province to be hosted by the Wuxi County Government. The five counties of Wujin, Guanyu, Jiangyin, Liyang, and Wuxi were designated as the Second District. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Wang Baoxuan immediately made active preparations and scheduled a preparatory meeting to be held at 10:00 AM today (10th) to discuss all the proceedings. Prior to that, letters were sent to County Magistrate Hou Houzong of Wujin, Director of Education Sun Youguang, County Magistrate Xiao Fengwei of Yixing, Director of Education Yang Yiqun, County Magistrate Yan Puquan of Jiangyin, Director of Education Xiong Gao, County Magistrate and Director of Education Chen Fu of Liyang, and the directors of the public stadiums of each county to attend the meeting in Wuxi.</p>
<p>Changzhou</p>
<p>The Agricultural Bank establishes a small loan office</p>
<p>In order to help small business, County Magistrate Hou of Wu requested the provincial government to establish a small loan office in the Agricultural Bank in the county. The director of the branch office will be concurrently held by Liu Yunting, the accounting director of the Agricultural Bank. The funds have been approved to be drawn from the general reserve fund, and it is scheduled to open officially on the 15th of this month. The director of the branch office, Liu, went to the provincial office to request instructions on everything as the opening date approached. The head office sent Hu Pingzhai to help with the preparations. Director Liu and Hu Pingzhai arrived in Changzhou on the afternoon of the 8th to carry out all the preparations, which should be able to open on schedule.</p>
<p>Yangzhou</p>
<p>Two deaths by shooting at Wanlu Temple</p>
<p>Zhenchuan, the abbot of Wanyuan Temple (about a mile from the town) in Caowang City Township, Fourth District, Jiangdu, (about 30 years old), and Ma Youtu, who lived in the temple with his wife, were shot and killed by bandits on the 6th. Women's fur coats and foreign ornaments, and monks' ceremonial clothing worth about 300 yuan were robbed. Kuang, Ma's wife, went to Xian Town yesterday (7th) to report to Director Bao of the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau, who reported it to the Jiangdu District Attorney's Office. This morning (8th), Prosecutor Meng Zhou rushed to inspect the scene and ordered the body to be prepared for burial, pending investigation and arrest of the murderers. According to the case details, more than ten years ago, the monk had an affair with the wife of Kuang Xiaosanzi, a cook in a certain camp stationed in Xian. Kuang's livelihood was unsustainable, and he divorced his wife. Later, he loaned money to Ma Youtu, who was in the business of tying flowers, to marry Kuang's wife, and they lived together in the temple. She was nominally Ma's wife, but in reality, she was the monk's woman. A few days ago, Kuang Xiaosanzi suddenly came to the temple and asked the abbot for his wife, but the monk sternly replied that you could not afford to ask for her back. Kuang gave a cold smile and left. On the day of the incident, neither the monk nor Ma were at home. Suddenly, two bandits came and asked where Youtu was. Ma's wife replied that he was not at home. The bandits pulled out pistols, forced Ma's wife and two servants into a room, and locked them up. In the afternoon, Ma returned and was shot three times and killed. The body was hidden. The bandits remained in the temple, waiting for the monk to return late at night, when he was also shot five times and killed. They then proceeded to loot extensively. At that time, the number of bandits increased, and they roared away. Liu Zonghan, captain of the Public Security Detective Team, was instructed by the county magistrate to solve the case within a time limit. In addition to sending detective police to investigate, he has scheduled to go to the scene of the incident with Detective Hu Keyin early tomorrow morning (9th) to investigate the situation. It is also reported that Kuang Xiaosanzi is now working as a squad leader in a certain armed unit in Taixian.</p>
<p>Current situation of requisitioning labor and collecting soil to repair embankments</p>
<p>Tang Jianzhong, Director of the Second Section of Jiangdu, and Shu Guohua, Director of the Construction Bureau, went to Shaobo to supervise the repair of the east dyke of the canal. According to the report from the Director of the Section to the county government, the recent situation of the dyke is not yet critical. During the great flood of the 20th year of the Republic, the water level mark from Gaoyou to the pier was above two zhang, but it has not yet reached one zhang. However, the situation is different this year, with the Yellow River encroaching south, so it is necessary to take precautions. They have supervised the relevant township chiefs of the Fourth and Seventh Districts to start requisitioning labor and collecting soil tomorrow. The cost of tea and water per unit has been increased to four cents, and the compensation for green seedlings is four yuan per mu. Wang Zizun, a flood officer, has been dispatched to handle the transport of labor with the county office.</p>
<p>Hangzhou</p>
<p>Two cars cause accidents on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road</p>
<p>At about 7:00 PM last night, a Frenchman named Fulai was driving his own car number 5114 to Shanghai near Lujia Matou Station in Zhelin, Pinghu County on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road. Due to careless driving, he ran over a pregnant woman named Yang Zhang, who has been sent to the Nanqiao Hospital for treatment. Also, at 6:30 PM, a German named Kraig was driving his own car number 8964 to Shanghai and crashed into three feet of the railing of the Zhelin Bridge. In both cases, the Road Bureau has detained the licenses for investigation.</p>
<p>Xiaoshan</p>
<p>Two houses robbed in one night</p>
<p>The home of Li Baoshan, deputy township chief of Taohu Township, Fourth District, Xiaoshan County, was well-off, leading to it being coveted by bandits. At about 2:00 AM on the 6th, more than ten bandits suddenly rushed in, immediately bound Li Baoshan and his family members, and threatened them to keep silent. They went upstairs, overturned boxes and chests, and looted at will. It is estimated that gold and silver jewelry and clothing worth more than 200 yuan were robbed. The victim has reported the loss to the township office and requested the county government to investigate and arrest the perpetrators. On the same night, the home of Xu Yuanfang, a resident of Deshengdian, Ganlu Township, Sixth District, was also robbed by more than ten bandits speaking a mixed dialect, armed with wooden-cased guns, who fired shots to intimidate the residents before entering and looting extensively. It is estimated that clothing, jewelry, and silver dollars totaling more than 400 yuan were robbed. A list of losses has been drawn up and reported to the county for investigation.</p>

<h3>Kong Xiangxi Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Morning to Discuss: The Central Government Decides to Retain President Wang; the Matter of Reforming the Monetary System Is Still Under Research and Planning; Outside Rumors That Currency Inflation Will Be Implemented Are Simply Ignorant</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Acting President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance Kong Xianxi, accompanied by Fu Rulin, Chairman of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission, and Peng Xuepei, a member of the Central Committee, left Beijing by night train at 11:00 PM the night before yesterday and arrived at the North Station at 7:15 AM yesterday morning. He went directly to West Asias Road to rest. At noon, he went to the Central Bank to handle important official business and met with newspaper reporters to issue important statements, details of which are recorded below:</p>
<p>Arrival in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning, Kong went directly to his private residence to rest. At about 9:00 AM, he met with Zheng Lai, Director of the Customs Administration, to listen to a report on customs affairs. Zhang Gongquan, Vice President of the Central Bank, accompanied by Li Shuming, Deputy Manager of the International Savings Society, visited Kong at 9:30 AM to request instructions on the International Savings Society issue. The meeting lasted for more than an hour before they left. Supervisor Yan Zhuang and Hangzhou Customs Superintendent Fan Guang visited successively at around 10:30 AM, spoke briefly, and then left. Kong then went to the Central Bank at 11:00 AM to handle important official business, and successively met with Italian angel Roya Gugno, Italian Air Force Colonel Scalongne, Shen Wei Li Shizeng, Song Ziwen, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Commission and Chairman of the Bank of China, Song Ziliang, General Manager of the National Products Bank, Qian Xinzhi, Manager of the Four Banks Preparation Treasury, and Xu Xinliu, General Manager of Zhejiang Industrial Bank.</p>
<p>Statements Made</p>
<p>Yesterday noon, Acting President Kong met with reporters from various newspapers at the Central Bank to answer various questions regarding President Wang's resignation. According to Kong, he had not yet heard of President Wang's resignation. When he was in Beijing, he heard that President Wang's health was gradually improving and that he would be able to return to Beijing in 20 days. If the reported resignation is indeed true, the Central Government will sincerely try to retain him and will definitely not let him retire. He plans to inspect the Yangtze River flood after he has some free time from official duties. As for the rumors that he will go to Lushan to escape the summer heat, that is not accurate. He currently has no time to escape the summer heat. Regarding the issue of reforming the monetary system, it is still under research and planning. In the future, it is planned to first recoin copper coins and then mint five-cent and ten-cent nickel coins, and twenty-five-cent and fifty-cent silver coins. The outside world has therefore mistakenly rumored that the government will implement currency inflation, which is simply ignorant.</p>

<h3>Yesterday Morning's Hurricane Veered, Shanghai Spared from Storm, Maritime Traffic Resumes</h3>
<p>According to the Astronomical Observatory's report yesterday, the Pacific hurricane, which was heading directly towards Shanghai the day before yesterday, had already reached Shanghai. However, at 6 PM that evening, the wind direction shifted northward, encountering Suzhou's western area, crossing the Yangtze River and reaching Nantong. Therefore, Shanghai was spared from disaster. By 6 AM yesterday morning, the Astronomical Observatory's records indicated that it had already left Nantong towards the Yellow Sea, located at 33 degrees north latitude and 122 degrees east longitude, with the wind direction northeast and the center at 60 nautical miles, blowing towards Korea. After learning that the hurricane's direction had shifted north and its center would not hit Shanghai, the Jianghai Customs immediately lifted the storm warning yesterday morning, removing the black ball from the customs clock tower flagpole. As a result, the ships that had been delayed by the storm the previous day, including Ningbo's Sanbei's "Ningxing," China Merchants' "Xinjiangtian," Yangtze River's China Merchants' "Jianghua," Taikoo's "Datong," Jardine Matheson's "Xin Pinghe," Nanhua's Taikoo's "Yuezhou," Fuzhou's Sanbei's "Wanxiang," and Wenzhou-Taizhou's Lianan's "Chuanshan," all resumed normal sailing yesterday morning. The Taikoo's Hong Kong-bound "Niuzhuang" and China Merchants' Beiyang-bound "Xinfeng," which had failed to arrive the previous day, also arrived yesterday morning. The China Merchants Bureau's "Haiheng" ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday. According to its crew, it encountered a hurricane and heavy rain outside Shantou Port and stopped sailing to avoid the storm for as long as 48 hours. Many other ships also stopped to avoid the storm at the same time, fortunately without any accidents. Also, the bureau's "Yushun" ship encountered a hurricane in the MS oupurnoud sea area and dropped anchor to stop sailing to avoid danger. The Wenzhou-bound "Neihaiyan" ship also received a hurricane warning in of Guarantin and immediately stopped sailing to avoid being hit. Furthermore, the "Gongping" ship sailing to Lotsin Boy and the "Xinming" ship sailing to 120 degrees 30 minutes east longitude and 30 degrees 30 minutes north latitude all received hurricane warnings and stopped sailing together. They all sent telegrams to Shanghai yesterday, saying that they would resume sailing after the storm passed.</p>
<h3>Huachang Steamship Report: Safely Arrived in Keelung Last Night</h3>
<p>Sheltering from the storm in Xiamen on the morning of the 3rd.</p>

This morning (the 9th), our company received a telegram sent from Keelung, as well as letters from the chief mate and chief engineer of the Huachang ship. According to them, they set sail from Hongji on July 29, passed through Hong Kong on the afternoon of the 1st, and suddenly received a weather report by wireless, knowing that a hurricane was approaching. Therefore, they arrived outside Xiamen Port on the morning of the 3rd to shelter from the storm. They safely arrived in Keelung last night, taking on coal and will be able to set sail. This is hereby communicated.</p>
<h3>The First Meeting of the Directors and Supervisors of the Flood Relief Charity Association Today</h3>
<p>Xu Shiying to Depart for Beijing by Night Train</p>
<p>Since Xu Shiying, the chairman of the Relief Committee, returned to Shanghai after inspecting the flood-stricken areas of the Yangtze River, he has been in contact with leaders from all walks of life in this city. He established the Shanghai Fundraising Charity Association for Flood Relief in Various Provinces the day before yesterday. It is now known that Xu believes that the severity of the floods in the Yellow River area is no less than that of the Yangtze River. The authorities in Shandong, Hebei, and Henan provinces have repeatedly requested Xu to go and inspect. After the Flood Relief Charity Association the day before yesterday, Xu issued a notice yesterday, informing the directors and supervisors of the association that the first meeting of directors and supervisors will be held at Renji Hall at 4 PM today. Xu will also take the night express train to Beijing tonight. After staying in Beijing for a short period, he will go north to inspect the flood situation in the Yellow River.</p>
<h3>Tan Zhen Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday and Discussed</h3>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, Tan Zhen, Vice President of the Judicial Yuan, left Beijing by night train on the evening of the 8th and arrived at the North Station at 7:15 AM on the 9th.

According to Tan, it is still undetermined whether he will go to Sichuan to visit Chairman Chiang and inspect the judicial construction in Sichuan Province. As for the National Judicial Conference, it will be convened in Beijing on the 20th.</p>
<h3>Rickshaws in Nanshi and the French Concession Resumed Work Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government and the Taxpayers' Association Agreed on Two Principles: Registration Fees Waived and Registration Time Extended — No Towing into the French Concession Until Officially Resolved —</p>
<p>Regarding the strike of rickshaw pullers in the French Concession, the Party and government authorities believed that it was related to traffic order, so they instructed the rickshaw guild to relay the message to the rickshaw owners, who then consulted all the rickshaw pullers to resume work first and wait for the government to handle it. At 6 AM yesterday morning, the rickshaw pullers resumed work, and the order was very good. However, it was limited to Nanshi because the licenses of the French Concession had been removed.</p>
<p>Temporary Scheduled Traffic Range</p>
<p>The rickshaw traffic range is specified as (A) in the Shanghai South area: (1) Zhonghua Road from Laoximen to Xiaodongmen, inside and outside the city walls; (2) Only the Huajie (Chinese area) sections of Minguo Road from Laoximen to Xiaodongmen, including Fangbang Road, Xiaobeimen, Xinqiao Street, Laobeimen, Xinbeimen, Xinkaihe, and Xinxiaodongmen. However, they cannot cross the iron gates of the French Concession; (3) Heping Road, Zhaozhou Road, and Xieqiao cannot cross the iron gates; (B) in the Shanghai West area: (1) Xujiahui along the Huajie Xiexu South Road, Jinji Bridge, Fenglin Bridge, and Fahua Town, but not across the bridges.</p>
<p>Fill out Registration Forms to Retrieve Detained Vehicles</p>
<p>The vehicles detained by the French Concession police stations can only be returned after the rickshaw pullers register. At 9 PM the night before, the guild sent standing committee members Qiu Chunshan and Zhang Huaiyang, together with Cheng Zhusun and Shang Mujing, members of the Taxpayers' Association and the Municipal Federation, to visit Du Yuesheng, the Chinese director of the French Concession, to report on the progress, fill out registration forms for each vehicle and each person according to the regulations, and retrieve the detained vehicles for business.</p>
<p>Extended Period for Preparation</p>
<p>The result of the consultation between the rickshaw merchant representatives at Du's residence, in addition to registering the rickshaw pullers and retrieving the detained vehicles, was to apply for registration for all the more than 6,000 rickshaws that had not been detained, according to the regulations of the French Concession. If the registration fee can be reduced after Du negotiates with the French authorities, the police station will refund it. The period is extended to the end of the year to allow the rickshaw pullers to prepare fully.</p>
<p>Issue Additional Licenses to Restore Traffic</p>
<p>On the evening of the 8th, the guild ordered the rickshaw owners to hand in their French Concession licenses to the guild. Yesterday, the rickshaw merchants consulted at the Penglai Teahouse and decided to return the French Concession notices. The French Concession rickshaws resumed traffic at 9 AM, but most of the rickshaw pullers were unwilling to pull in the French Concession, so the number was not as crowded on the road as it was before August 6.</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Sent Personnel to Supervise the Resumption of Work</p>
<p>Because the Social Affairs Bureau was afraid that the rickshaw owners and rickshaw pullers would still have strong prejudices, at 9 AM yesterday morning, it sent Wang Gang, the director of the Huigong Division, and Zhu Zhulin, a mediator, to earnestly advise the rickshaw owners and rickshaw pullers to maintain traffic as the top priority. At the same time, they also supervised the resumption of work by the rickshaw pullers and went to various roads to inspect the situation, saw that the order was good, and immediately returned to the bureau to report.</p>
<p>The Authorities Agreed on Two Principles</p>
<p>The municipal government attached great importance to this case. Yesterday afternoon, it specially sent Secretary Geng Jiaji, Wang Gang, the director of the Huigong Division of the Social Affairs Bureau, Du Ri and Shang Mujing of the French Concession Taxpayers' Chinese Association, and Qiu Chunshan and Zhang Huaiyang, representatives of the guild, to negotiate together and agree on two principles: (1) Rickshaw puller registration is free of charge; (2) The registration time is extended by two months, which will be negotiated by the municipal government and the Taxpayers' Association with the French authorities.</p>
<p>Prevent Leaks to Avoid Losses</p>
<p>The Special District Office of the Rickshaw Industry Guild of this city convened an emergency meeting of directors at 10 AM yesterday morning. More than ten people, including Gu Songmao, Hou Shaoan, and Jin Chunlin, attended the meeting as scheduled. After Chairman Gu Songmao reported the purpose of the meeting, the elbow discussion items were: (1) The case of the leakage trend in the Public Concession vehicles driving into the French Concession. It was resolved to notify the rickshaw merchants to inform the rickshaw pullers to temporarily stop driving into the French Concession to avoid losses; (2) The case of the French Concession rickshaw pullers opposing registration and requesting assistance. It was resolved to provide assistance according to law; (3) The case of the insufficient number of registered rickshaw pullers in the Public Concession. It was resolved to send a letter to the authorities requesting continuous registration. Finally, the chairman reported that the case of the representative suing Zheng Fazhu for compensation for losses had been scheduled for sentencing on the morning of the 13th of this month. The meeting was adjourned. As for the conflict between the Yuebu and the rickshaw pullers on the 6th of this month, in order to facilitate negotiations, the rickshaw owners and rickshaw pullers specially designated responsible representatives to handle all matters, including rickshaw merchants Qiu Chunshan, Zhang Huaiyang, Yu Dakin, and rickshaw pullers Xu Hongsheng, Zhou Yongcai, Yang Yougui, and Li Asi, a total of seven people, as fully authorized representatives to resolve all unresolved cases together with the Party and government authorities.</p>
<p>Notify Rickshaw Merchants to Avoid Accidents</p>
<p>The Special District Office notified the rickshaw merchants yesterday, "Because the French Concession authorities forced rickshaw pullers to register this time, it caused a major trend on the 6th of this month, which eventually led to a strike by rickshaw pullers in various parts of Shanghai South. Our special district rickshaw merchants have been subjected to leakage and sabotage, and the losses are incalculable. If we do not take precautions, how can we imagine it? We must say that our special district colleagues should entrust the rickshaw pullers to never drive in without authorization until the municipal government is responsible for handling the unresolved matters to avoid accidents. In addition to sending a special letter of notification, we will publish a notice in Shen Xin and other newspapers. Regarding the registration of rickshaw pullers in the British Concession, we hope that the rickshaw owners will inform the rickshaw pullers to drag them to the registration office before the 15th of this month, and do not make mistakes," and so on.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Industry and Commerce Seeks to Relieve Industry and Commerce Formulated Three Measures</h3>
<p>Researching Control to Increase International Trade Formulating Protection Policies to Investigate Exports</p>
<p>According to Xinxin News Agency, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, in view of the recent bankruptcy of the rural economy in our country, the huge trade deficit in international trade, and the resulting economic poverty of the people, and the extreme depression of industry and commerce, has now formulated three relief measures and is actively proceeding with them. They are recorded below:</p>
<p>Increase Exports</p>
<p>(1) In recent years, international economic policies have often changed. Either low currencies, managed foreign exchange, controlled trade with quota systems, and increased tariffs, etc., all possible ways to increase exports and prohibit imports are implemented as much as possible. The commodities exported from our country, such as silk, tea, silk, cotton, and egg products, are all affected by increased taxes and quota pressure in various countries, resulting in a decreasing number of exported goods. We are also studying control measures, and once they are drafted, we will consult with relevant departments to discuss effective remedial measures to make fundamental relief. At the same time, it will be held in the middle of this month.</p>
<p>Protection Policies</p>
<p>(2) The business situation of our country's exported commodities is rarely investigated in detail, and accurate statistics, and the export situation, are not known. We are currently drafting a form to order local governments in various provinces and cities to investigate the business situation of various exported commodities to serve as a reference for formulating protection policies. We will also investigate the nature of the products, and if they can be sold overseas, we will guide the merchants to find ways to promote and try to sell them, and order the consulates abroad to introduce them on their behalf. At the same time, we will collect samples and forward them to domestic manufacturers for imitation to promote sales.</p>
<p>Investigate Exports</p>
<p>To promote foreign trade as much as possible, it is necessary to understand foreign commercial information. Therefore, European and American countries often send foreign commercial investigation missions. The overseas Chinese in our country are scattered abroad, and they have suffered extremely heavy losses in the recent global depression. If we want to seek considerable relief, we must have accurate investigations. Minister Chen, in view of this, personally went to Nanyang last year to inspect various properties. In addition to actively preparing for the investigation team to go to various factories in Siam to investigate the commercial situation, we will continue to send personnel to Europe, the United States, and Japan to conduct similar investigations to make improvements. All the candidates and budget for the inspection team to Siam are being reviewed and will soon be seen in fact.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Finance Director Xu Qing Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Province Plans to Issue Six Million Yuan in Treasury Bonds Once Visited Finance Minister Kong in Beijing to Inquire About Everything</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government recently reported that the province's treasury deficit for the 23rd year reached 3 million yuan, and the new budget deficit for the 24th year is also nearly 3 million yuan. Huang Shaoxiong, the chairman of the province, visited Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Finance Minister Kong successively to report on everything, and planned to issue 6 million yuan in gold treasury bonds to make up for it. The bonds will be secured by the province's business tax as a guarantee fund. Xu Qingpu, the director of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance, entered Beijing specifically to visit Finance Minister Kong to inquire about everything. Now that his official business is over, he arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. At 10:30 AM, he went to the Central Bank to visit Deputy Finance Minister Xu Kan to discuss the issuance of treasury bonds. He did not leave until 11:11 AM. It is reported that Mr. Xu does not intend to stay in Shanghai for long and plans to return to Hangzhou within days.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Strictly Enforces Bank Registration</h3>
<p>Twenty-Three Approved for Establishment in Recent Months All Unregistered Ones Will Be Banned</p>
<p>According to Xinxin News Agency, in order to prevent newly established banks in various places from opening business without completing registration procedures, and once they go bankrupt, affecting depositors and social finance, the Ministry of Finance strictly enforces supervision and registration. The Ministry recently listed 23 banks that were approved for registration from October last year to the end of June this year and sent them to the provincial governments and the Shanghai Municipal Government for verification. If there are any banks or money houses that have been established without approval, please transfer them to the ban to comply with the law. The consultation and approved banks are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Consultation with Various Provinces and Cities Original Text</p>
<p>Regarding the name, organization, paid-up capital, location of the head office, and the date of approval of registration of approved banks, and the issuance of business licenses and numbers, etc., this Ministry has compiled a list and sent it to your provincial and municipal governments for verification. If you encounter any unapproved and unregistered banks or money houses, please order them to quickly follow the regulations, prepare various registration documents, and submit them to the Ministry for verification. At the same time, pay attention to supervision at any time. If the approved banks establish branches in various provinces and cities, they should send the registration approved by the Ministry and the establishment of branches to the local government for verification and record. If there are any branches that have been established without approval, the local government should transfer them to the Ministry for verification in order to comply with the law and facilitate investigation. Now, from October of the 23rd year to the end of June of this year, there are many more banks that have been approved for registration and reissued business licenses by this Ministry. A detailed list is compiled and sent for verification, and it is hoped that it will be transferred to your subordinate agencies for knowledge.</p>
<p>List of Approved Banks</p>
<p>Shanghai Salt Industry Bank 7.5 million yuan, Shanghai Silk Industry Commercial Savings Bank 1.2 million yuan, Shanghai Agricultural and Commercial Bank 3 million yuan, Shanghai Dazhong Bank 2.6 million yuan, Shanghai Jianhua Bank 500,000 yuan, Shanghai Guoxin Bank 1 million yuan, Shanghai Yizhong Enterprise Bank 500,000 yuan, Shanghai Taihexing Bank Co., Ltd. 500,000 yuan, Hankou Dafu Commercial Bank paid-up capital 1 million silver yuan, Hankou Trust Co., Ltd. 400,000 yuan, Nanjing Commercial Savings Bank 251,750 yuan, Tianjin Bianye Bank 1 million yuan, Zhejiang Zhenhai Industrial Bank 250,000 yuan, Sichuan Xinye Bank 1 million yuan, Taiyuan Tongxiang Bank 50,000 yuan, Hangzhou Liangzhe Commercial Bank 500,000 yuan, Sichuan Construction Bank 1 million yuan, Hankou Commercial Bank 1 million yuan, Shaoxing Commercial Bank 250,000 yuan, Fuzhou Commercial Bank 250,000 yuan, Wenzhou Commercial Bank 200,000 yuan, Chongqing Civilian Bank 250,000 yuan, Tianjin Qiming New Record Bank 200,000 yuan</p>
<h3>Guangdong Fellow Countrymen Association Requests Guangdong Province to Abolish the Control of Local Sugar</h3>
<p>The Guangdong Provincial Industry Management Office's control of local sugar has aroused great resentment among the people of fifteen prefectures in Chaozhou and Meizhou. Local sugar is one of the agricultural products, and farmers work hard all year round, relying on it for food and clothing. At a time when the countryside is declining, if registration and suspension of transportation are implemented, it will be like draining the pond to catch the fish. The lives of millions of creatures will inevitably perish together. Now, local sugar is piled up like mountains and cannot be transported for sale. At this time of scorching summer heat, there is even a risk of dissolution. The Guangdong Fellow Countrymen Association in Shanghai specially requested the situation from Chen Jitang, Commander-in-Chief of the First Group Army, Lin Yunge, Chairman of the Province, Qu Mangpu, Director of the Department of Finance, and He Qiqin, Director of the Department of Construction, and requested that the order be withdrawn immediately to maintain production and alleviate the suffering of the people. Every word is a tear, and I cannot bear to read it. This is also something that those who care about the people's suffering should pay special attention to. The original submission is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Through Traffic on the Shanghai-Guangdong Highway: The Entire Route is 1,779 Miles Long, Reachable by Car in 122 Hours</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Guangdong Highway has now been completed under the supervision of the National Economic Council's Highway Department and the Guangdong Provincial Highway Engineering Bureau. A private car has already traversed the entire route once, with excellent results. However, both authorities reportedly do not intend to hold a traffic opening ceremony. Our East China News Agency reporter has investigated and reports the details as follows:</p>
<p>Places Passed</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Guangdong Highway follows the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway to Hangzhou, then from Hangzhou to Yushan, Nanchang, Changsha, Hengshan, Ganzhou, Dayu, Nanxiong to Shaoguan, then turns to Shantou and arrives at Guangzhou. The entire road surface engineering, from Shanghai to Shaoguan, was supervised by the National Economic Council's Highway Department, while the section from Shaoguan to Guangzhou was supervised by the Guangdong Provincial Highway Engineering Bureau.</p>
<p>Segmented Completion</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Guangdong Highway is 1,779 miles long. The section from Shanghai to Shaoguan is 1,023 miles, and the Highway Department of the National Economic Council was responsible for supervising the construction in the various provinces and cities it passed through. Since the council began supervising the construction in May of the 21st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1932], the section between Shanghai and Hangzhou (i.e., the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway) was completed and opened to traffic earlier in the previous year. The sections from Hangzhou to Yushan, Nanchang, Changsha, Hengshan, Ganzhou, Dayu, Nanxiong, and Shaoguan have also been actively expedited by the Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces, and were fully completed last month. Branch lines between the provinces have been opened to traffic one after another. The section from Shaoguan to Guangzhou is 756 *li* long and was supervised by Guangdong Province. Since the province urged the Highway Engineering Bureau to start construction in the autumn of the 22nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1933], it has been two years, and it was also completed last month. Therefore, the entire Shanghai-Guangdong line can now be directly traversed by car. Because the authorities of each province along the way held a traffic opening ceremony after each section of the province was completed (as with the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway), both sides plan not to hold another traffic opening ceremony.</p>
<p>First Through Traffic</p>
<p>After the road was completed, Mr. Ni Tuosheng from Fujian, along with two friends, drove his own Model Y Ford car on a full-line test drive on the 21st of last month to investigate the actual situation of highway development along the way. According to Mr. Ni upon his return to Shanghai, this trip followed the above-mentioned route, going directly from Shanghai to Guangzhou. The travel time was calculated as 57 hours for the Shanghai to Shaoguan section and 65 hours for the Shaoguan via Shantou to Guangzhou section, for a total of 122 hours to reach Guangzhou directly. The latter section is shorter in mileage, but took more time because the road between Shantou and Guangzhou is rugged and difficult to travel, and also requires detours. The results of this trip were excellent. The highways in Hunan Province are based on science everywhere, neat, solid, and the best in the provinces, not much inferior to those in Europe and America. Although our country has been working hard to build highways in recent years, there are not many people who drive for long distances. Mr. Ni's perseverance is admirable. It is also heard that the gasoline used this time was only 106 gallons.</p>

<h3>The 13th Lottery Drawing Was Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>The First Prize is Number 233781, Sold by the Dayun Company's Retail Department. The Next Drawing is Scheduled for September 6th</p>
<p>Since the National Government's Aviation Highway Construction Lottery changed its method starting from the 13th period, there are more opportunities to win, so sales have been very strong. At 2:00 PM yesterday, the 13th lottery drawing was held as usual at Yiyuan Park in public, and there were many spectators. After Committee Member Wang Xiaolai and Director Chen Hong reported on the revised method, the drawing began. The first prize was number 233781, which was drawn at about 2:45 PM. It was found that it was sold in strips by the retail department of Dayun Company. The winner is unknown.

There are a total of 300,000 lottery numbers, and each number is still sold for ten yuan and sold in strips. Although the first prize has been reduced to 250,000 yuan, the other smaller prizes are more than before, and ten additional prizes are added for the upper and lower associated numbers of the first and second prizes. However, in order to simplify the drawing procedures, the original fifth and sixth prizes all use the last three characters for matching numbers, so although there are many winning numbers, the drawing is very fast and convenient.</p>

<h3>Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society Was Sabotaged Yesterday</h3>
<p>Distributing Fake Leaflets. The Society Explains the Situation</p>
<p>Yesterday, leaflets signed "Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society Declaration" and "Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society Promotion, Relief Undertakings, Giving 20,000 of Rice, Giving 40,000 of Clothes, Lending 400,000, Fellow Members, Now the Market in Shanghai, Is Really Bad to the Extreme, You Must Also Be Suffering Greatly, Moreover, Now Is the Time of Scarcity, Although You Run Under the Hot Sun Every Day, But the Income is Very Little, Even Can Not Support the Whole Family, I am Afraid That Even My Own Life, Maybe, Can Not Be Maintained, We Understand This Most Painful and Difficult Life Very Well, Now to Relieve Your Pain Has Been Done, 20,000 of Rice, 40,000 of Clothes, Waiting for You All to Receive, and We Have Recruited Enough Rickshaw Pullers Savings Bank Capital 500,000 Especially Set Up Loan Department, If You Have Any Expenses, You Can Come to the Bank of This Association to Borrow, But Each Member Is Limited to at Most Ten Dollars, All the Above, You Can Go to the General Association on Jiaxing Road, Ask Director-General Zhang Dengyun, Request to Issue It, I Think You Got This Good News, Must Be Very Happy, and You Must Support the Work of This Association and the Competence of the Director-General, etc.," were distributed on the roads within the concession and in Zhabei and the Southern City, intending to instigate the general public and rickshaw pullers in the concession to go to the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society to make trouble. Yesterday, the responsible person of the Mutual Aid Society issued the following statement:</p>
<p>"Our Association is dedicated to providing welfare undertakings for rickshaw pullers within the concession, improving all aspects of their lives and treatment. Five offices have been established, and there are more than twenty types of practical welfare work (see the newspapers of August 5th). However, where there is profit, competition is bound to be fierce, so there are often people who do various things to sabotage the economy of this association. There are many reasons for this kind of sabotage. Because they cannot participate in the Mutual Aid Association and control everything, they express jealousy and resentment, which is not worth the recognition of those who know better. Yesterday at 1:30 PM, many people holding the following leaflets came to the General Association and the Southern City Branch, demanding that the items listed on the leaflets be issued. The staff of this association persuaded them not to be manipulated by others, repeatedly enlightened them, and dispersed them after persuading them in a good manner, without causing any trouble. From 1:30 PM to 4:00 PM, the number of rickshaw pullers who came to the association to ask for items reached six or seven hundred. Among them, a rickshaw puller named Zhang Wanhe, registration number 5381, pointed out on the spot that this kind of leaflet was given by Zhu Fengxiang, in a number of seven or eight sheets, and Zhu Fengxiang instructed him to distribute them to each rickshaw puller. At that time, the Jiaxing Road Police Station and the bailiff also arrived. After inquiring about the details of this association, they took Zhang Wanhe away for questioning. After 4:00 PM, a rickshaw puller led a person who was distributing leaflets on the road to the association. This association handed him over to the police for handling. According to the confession, they were also instigated by Zhu Fengxiang et al. on Liyuan Road in the Southern City to distribute them, and they promised them a major reward in the future. At the same time, it happened to be the time when the Board of Directors of this Association was holding a standing meeting, and Zhu Fengxiang, Xu Zhulin, Cang Gongwen, etc. came to the association and declared that they would announce the accounts of this association, demand that the items listed on the leaflets be issued, and must meet with the directors. They were also taken to the police station by the bailiff for handling. Although there was a slight conflict among the dozens of people who came with them, it was quickly suppressed by the detectives and pacified."</p>
<h3>Zheng Yu Gui's Wife Commits Suicide by Poison; Her Family Accuses Him of Assault</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the medical certificate of injury was certified by the doctor; the court still needs to investigate and postpone the hearing.</p>
<p>Zheng Yu Gui, a Chaozhou native and the small proprietor of the Yongning Pawnshop at 22 Chengdu Road, and his wife, Chen Lianna, committed suicide by opium smoking on the 19th of last month. Because she left a suicide note stating that all her jewelry was in the bathroom on the third floor of her mother's home at 84 Yugu Village, Yugu Road, Zheng negotiated with his mother-in-law, Chen Yang. The latter also reported to the Chengdu Road police station that her son-in-law had beaten her daughter on March 12th of last year, causing injuries. After investigation by detective Huang Fu Sen, Zheng filed a public lawsuit, which was summoned once by the Special Court. The details of the bribes have been recorded in this newspaper on the 3rd of this month. Yesterday morning, Judge Ye Sheng Chao summoned them in the Second Criminal Court. According to Zhang Shi Zhu, the lawyer of the police station, Dr. Dao from Renji Hospital, who was ordered by the court to summon, had arrived in court. Dao then submitted the case, proving that the injury certificate of the deceased was signed by him, but he did not know who caused the injury. The court then asked Chen Yang if there was any other evidence besides the maid, Lu Wu. She replied that there was no other proof. When questioned, Zheng Yu Gui stated that the relationship between him and his wife was quite harmonious. Chen Lianna's suicide was due to the fact that his family was old-fashioned, and she felt that she could not freely go out to play. Zheng's defense lawyer, Chen Ting Rui, immediately stood up and stated one point, asking the court to pay attention, saying that the opium Chen Lianna took when she committed suicide came from her mother's home. The court, needing further investigation, ordered a postponement of the hearing.</p>
<h3>Robbers Gun Down Shop Owner on Dongchang Road, Pudong</h3>
<p>The Public Security Bureau is close by, yet the robbers are rampant to this extent.</p>
<p>Hu De Sheng, a native of Changzhou, opened a small cigarette paper shop (said to have less than 100 yuan in capital) at No. 71 Tian, Bingchang Road, Dongchang Road, Lan Ni Du, Pudong. At about 9 o'clock the night before, three robbers suddenly broke into the shop, threatened with guns, and searched everywhere, but found nothing of value. The robbers were very disappointed. Because the drawer of the account case was tightly locked, the robbers forced the shop owner to ask where the key was. Knowing that it was difficult to escape, Hu De Sheng said that the key was upstairs and allowed him to go and get it. After he finished speaking, he turned around and went upstairs. At that time, only Hu's wife, Hu Wu, was in the shop. Seeing that the robbers were fierce, she shouted for help. The robbers were angry at her publicity and immediately opened fire, hitting the left temple of the woman. The bullet did not penetrate, and the woman fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. Seeing that they had caused trouble, the robbers had no time to rob and fled in a swarm. Hu De Sheng, who was upstairs, suddenly heard a gunshot and knew something was wrong. He rushed downstairs and saw his wife lying in a pool of blood, already dead. He couldn't help but grieve loudly over the body. When the police on duty heard the news and rushed over, the robbers had already disappeared without a trace. They immediately reported to the Pudong Branch. Yesterday morning, they instructed the local Bao Lu Shun Long to report to the local court for an autopsy. Prosecutor Zhang Zi was then commissioned to lead examiner Shen Qi Xiu to Pudong for an autopsy. They instructed the corpse handler to put the body in a coffin and wait for the arrest of the murderer. The location of the incident is very close to the Pudong Branch. The robbers dared to be so rampant, truly showing a lack of fear of the law.</p>
<h3>Stock Broker from Jin Yu Securities Embezzles Huge Amount of Securities</h3>
<p>Worth over 33,000 yuan; when the situation became urgent, he surrendered himself—two accomplices are at large and have not been caught.</p>
<p>Wei Ting Rong's eldest son, Yuan Sheng, a well-known figure in this city who once served as the commander of the French Concession Volunteer Corps, has recently been repeatedly losing money due to operating public bonds and securities with Gan Deng Lai, a runner from Jin Yu Securities. Gan could not stand it and absconded with a large sum of money from the company. He was arrested a few days ago, while Wei Yuan Sheng also fled without a trace because he was suspected of being an important suspect and the court issued a warrant for his arrest. Now, because the main suspect is at large, the case may not be easily concluded for a while, so we will describe its process and the feelings of the public as follows:</p>
<p>Jin Yu Securities</p>
<p>The company is located at 16 Qingyuan Lane, Beiyuan Road, between the British and French concessions. It was founded by Shen Chang Geng, and the current manager is Gan Yun Qiao, a native of Yuyao. Gan Deng Lai is also from the same hometown. Gan Deng Lai serves as the company's runner, recommended by Gan Ting Hui, specializing in soliciting transactions and delivering certificates. Wei Ting Rong's son, Wei Yuan Sheng, has often bought and sold securities in the name of Wei Yuan Sheng in recent years, and gradually became acquainted with Gan Deng Lai. Over time, their friendship became deep. Recently, they jointly operated, but both failed, losing more than 16,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Gan Lai</p>
<p>lacked financial resources, and thus conceived the idea of embezzlement, hoping to make up for it. On the morning of July 29, Jin Yu transferred 60,000 yuan of 22-year customs treasury bills and interest coupons due in July of this year to Gan Deng Lai for encashment at the Bank of China and the Central Bank, equivalent to 33,053.56 yuan. He took the opportunity to steal it and flee. Gan Yun Qiao, the manager of Jin Yu, waited until the day before yesterday and still did not see him return. He entered his empty bedroom to check, and found that his clothes and other items were gone. He then knew that Gan Deng Lai</p>
<p>had been planning for a long time</p>
<p>and immediately reported to the police station, offering a reward for his arrest. It turned out that Gan Deng Lai took the interest money from the bank that day and, together with the coupons, took refuge in Wei Yuan Sheng's home at 194 Xujiahui Road in the French Concession. By the evening of August 1, Gan Lai felt that the outside world was very tense and that he could not avoid the matter by hiding, so he surrendered to the police station with coupons worth 5,000 yuan. The next morning, he was sent to the First Special District Court for questioning. Because the stolen goods were not complete,</p>
<p>Wei Yuan Sheng was greatly involved.</p>
<p>In addition to detaining the defendant, a warrant was issued to search for Wei Yuan Sheng. That afternoon, the police station sent detectives Su Chang Sheng and Li Yi to the French Concession Police Station and dispatched more detectives to Wei Yuan Sheng's home to arrest him, but they did not find Wei's trace. They only found some hidden coupons. They then went to Yuan Sheng's residence, 999 next door, to inquire at the residence of his father, Wei Ting Rong. According to him, Yuan Sheng went to Hangzhou and would return in about a week. After this search, the result was that Yuan Sheng,</p>
<p>although not captured,</p>
<p>had mostly returned the property Gan Lai stole. Later, Gan Deng Lai claimed that there were still 5,000 coupons and 2,300 yuan in cash, which he gave to Wang Xin Quan to take back to his hometown in Yuyao. So Li and Su immediately went to Yuyao, but they did not find the original stolen goods. They only found a piece of wrapping paper for the coupons, and Wang Xin Quan was not found either. Yesterday morning was the date for the continued trial. The police station still sent Gan Deng Lai to the First Special Court, where Judge Feng Shi De interrogated him. Jiang Bao Lian, the lawyer for the police station,</p>
<p>described the process.</p>
<p>After the condolences, he requested another postponement, stating that Wei Yuan Sheng and Wang Xin Quan, the important criminals, had not yet been arrested and the case could not proceed. On the other hand, the detectives were stepping up their efforts to arrest them. Jin Yu Securities hired lawyer Wu Lin Kun as its representative and filed an incidental civil lawsuit against Gan Deng Lai, stating that in addition to the actual embezzlement, the defendant also caused damages of (1) treasury bills with a face value of 5,000 yuan, (2) 1,986.71 yuan in cash, and (3) 473.50 yuan in interest coupons, and (4) 2,834.85 yuan in damages for private transactions. The plaintiff requested a judgment ordering the defendant to repay the money. The defendant also hired lawyer Jiang Yi Ping to defend him. As a result, the court ordered the defendant to be detained and the hearing to be postponed for seven days.</p>
<h3>Another Murderous Robber Captured</h3>
<p>Li Shun Xing was arrested on Bazai Road; will be tried together with Wu Zhen Rong after clarification</p>
<p>The Ji Xing Pawnshop at 640 Haining Road was broken into at 9:55 pm on the 28th of last month. Under the pretext of pawning a white silk short shirt, the robbers asked the shop assistant, Wang Xiang Xun, a Chaozhou native, to hand over silver dollars, but they failed. They shot Wang, killing him with a brain injury. Jin Hai Bo and Wang Guang Qi, Chinese detectives of the Hongkou Police Station, successively arrested two criminals, Wu Zhen Rong from Zhenjiang and Chen Zheng Hao from Shaoxing, and sent them to the First Special District Court. They confessed that there was an accomplice, Li Shun Xing (Li is also known as Wu A Gou, from Suzhou, 20 years old), who was on the run. The court ordered a postponement and returned the two defendants to custody. At about 5 o'clock the morning before, the Chinese and Western detectives in charge of the case learned that Wu was hiding in house number 9, Lane 502, Bazai Road. They secretly went to the address and arrested him, took him to the police station and put him in custody. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court. Wang Yao Tang, the lawyer for the Public Works Department, stated that the defendant was the robber who entered the pawnshop with Wu to pawn clothes at that time. He requested an extension of the custody and a joint trial with Wu Zhen Rong and Chen Zheng Hao. When questioned, the defendant confessed that he was a shop assistant in a foreign firm and was invited by Min Jiali (i.e., Wu Zhen Rong) to plot a robbery. Judge Jiang Shu Zi ruled that he should remain in custody and be tried together with Wu Zhen Rong.</p>
<h3>Telephone Price Increase; Special Committee to be Established in Late August</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the Public Works Department of the Public Concession has decided to organize a special committee to resolve the issue of telephone price increases. All the Chinese, British, Japanese, and American special committee members have already been appointed. It is now learned that the British committee member, Mr. Brown, and the Japanese committee member, Inada, will arrive in Shanghai within days. The American committee member, Mr. Lai, will also arrive in Shanghai around the 20th on the President McKinley. The Chinese committee member, Mr. Hu Rui Xiang, can arrive at any time.

<h3>State-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to Host the Press Today</h3>

<h3>Da Xin and Hua Hua Silk and Satin Company Jointly Relocating and Holding a Mega Sale</h3>
<p>Over 100,000 in stock...Starts tomorrow</p>
<p>The Da Xin Silk and Satin Company, located at the intersection of Third Road and Shilu Road, has been open for many years and has always served customers with genuine prices and goods without making exaggerated publicity. Therefore, it has been deeply praised by ladies in society. Recently, because the original address was not enough to display the goods, a new site was selected at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Yunnan Road in preparation for relocation. At the same time, its affiliate, Hua Hua Silk and Satin Company, on the opposite side, will also be relocated together. Therefore, the inventory of the affiliate will be combined for sale. In order to facilitate the sorting and price reduction, the store will not be open for retail sales for the next two days. Starting tomorrow (the 11th), a joint mega sale will be held at the original site of the bureau. All the company's inventory over the years and new styles will be priced below cost. This is not like the usual sales that use cheap prices as a gimmick, but instead it is different because of the one or two kinds of reduced-price goods as tools to attract customers. It is said that the total inventory is more than 100,000 yuan, and all kinds of silks and satins, various patterns, and various colors are available. However, because this auction is a big sacrifice that disregards everything, customers will definitely know that it is cheaper than any silk and satin store in Shanghai after comparing it with other stores after purchasing it. Therefore, it is expected that customers will spread the word to each other and come together in droves, and the store will be packed.</p>

<h3>Maid Commits Suicide for Love; Follows Chauffeur in Death; Master Unjustly Implicated</h3>
<p>Su Xing Hua, a Cantonese girl, is seventeen years old this year. She is slender and lovely. She lost her parents at a young age and was sold to Chen Wu Min (formerly the commander of the First Army of the Five Provinces剿匪 Army in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Jiangxi) as a maid at the age of seven. She received a superficial education. The Chen family resides at 15 Enlihe Road in the French Concession and owns a private car, hiring Wang Lian Bao (25 years old this year) from Kunshan as a chauffeur. Wang is a handsome young man. Although he is a chauffeur, his clothes in his spare time are like those of a rich man. Xing Hua and Wang serve in the same family. The girl's love for the first time, and the two secretly fell in love. Both parties have the intention of getting married, but their master does not know it. Because the two found it difficult to open their mouths to their master to ask, they did not get their wish. Xing Hua secretly went out at the beginning of last month, intending to marry Wang permanently. Therefore, she lingered in Wang's handyman's home. Because the master's search was urgent, the girl returned home. However, her master suspected that Wang Lian Bao had seduced her, and the mistress was cold to Wang. She hired another car to travel every day and refused to hire Wang. After being stimulated, Wang committed suicide by poisoning himself in the master's car room on the 6th of last month. The suicide note involved Xing Hua's private escape and the master's cold treatment. On the next day, Chen's servant Yu Fu discovered that Wang was dead, reported it to the police station, and sent the body car to the morgue for an autopsy. The Special Second Court sent personnel to inspect the body, and the family collected the body. Chen's family did not live in the house after Wang's death due to superstition and opened a room at the Cangzhou Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road. Xing Hua also followed her master. However, since Wang Lian Bao's death, she had been depressed and unhappy. Recently, she had suicidal thoughts. On the 7th, she went out without her master's permission to buy new shoes and socks and two boxes of raw opium (one yuan per box). At 9 pm, she went to Renhe Hotel at 114 Fada Road, East Zilaihuo Street, French Concession, under the pseudonym Zheng Yong Chang, falsely reporting that she was 20 years old, and opened room number 4 to check in. She committed suicide by poisoning herself. After taking the poison, she changed her clothes, shoes and socks, decorated and applied powder, and lay down waiting for death to come. At 0:30 pm on the 8th, tea room waiter Wang Jinyuan (19 years old, from Pudong) saw that she had not gotten up yet, so he knocked on the door. He called for a long time but there was no response. When he opened the door and went inside to check, he found that she had already died. The body was cold, so he reported it to the French police station. Detectives were sent to investigate and found two suicide notes, stating the death of Lian Bao, etc., and stating the address of her master. The body was carried to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall autopsy room. Her master was notified. Yesterday, the Special Second Court was requested. Prosecutor Wang, accompanied by a forensic scribe, etc., came to the institute for an autopsy. The master sent his servant Yu Fu to the case to represent the collection of the body. The official questioned tea room waiter Wang Jinyuan and Yu Fu and reviewed the deceased's suicide notes. The official declared that Su Xing Hua, Zheng Yong Chang, had indeed committed suicide by poisoning while alive. The body was handed over to Yu Fu for collection and his master was notified to inform the family of the body.</p>

<h3>Regulations of the Ministry of Railways: Standardizing Names for Pickled Eggs, Yesterday's Order to Two Railway Bureaus to Comply</h3>
<p>The two railway administrations, yesterday received an order from the Ministry of Railways, according to a case presented by the Business Department, regarding an inquiry from the Jiaoji Railway Management Committee about whether a product called "Songhua" (pine flower egg), also known as "Biandan" (preserved egg), should be categorized under which item. After checking the Ministry's Commodity Classification Table, Category 5 of the Livestock Section, there is an item for "pickled eggs" (refer to 26), which should include all kinds of pickled eggs such as Songhua. However, Category 6 of the Industry Section lists "pickled eggs" as third class. Since the names in these two items are inconsistent, the Industry Section 6 should change its name to "pickled eggs," following the name listed in Agriculture Section 5, to ensure uniformity, and still classify it as third class. As for the names Songhua or Biandan, they should not be listed separately in the Ministry's Commodity Classification Table. Based on the presented situation, a general order is issued to all railways to comply. Besides separate orders, this is the order. The bureau has already instructed the transportation department to comply.</p>

<h3>Kidnappers from Wujiang Arrested in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Ling Yuanpei, the district chief of the Sixth District of Wujiang County, Suzhou, recently received a tip from informants that three bandits from Wujiang, Lu Songlin, Lu Qiulin, and Lu Asan, who had repeatedly committed kidnapping and robbery in the district, were hiding at No. 1 Sanqing Lane, Baille Road, in the French Concession of Shanghai. Ling immediately reported to the Wujiang County Magistrate Xu Youchuan, who prepared a document and sent Ling to Shanghai. At 5 AM yesterday, Ling reported to the French Police and requested assistance in apprehending and transferring them. The police chief then dispatched detectives Bu Zhenglong, Xu Jinlong, and Liu Deyi to go to the address at 8 AM. First, at No. 1 Sanqing Lane, they arrested Lu A'er (38 years old, from Wujiang) and Chen Genlin (45 years old, from Suzhou). Then, at No. 12 of the same lane, they arrested Wu Zaiying (24 years old, from Wujiang), Lu Songlin (39 years old, from Wujiang), Wang Genfu (25 years old, from Suzhou), and Gao Jinsheng (30 years old, from Suzhou). They were taken to the police station and, at 11 AM, escorted to the Second Special Court, where Criminal Court President Wang Gangxu interrogated them in Criminal Court One.

<h3>Impersonating Court Investigators to Extort Money</h3>
<p>Recently, a kind of rogue with a wild idea has emerged, impersonating court investigators to extort investigation fees from litigants. Quite a few people have fallen victim. Last month, in the case of Gu Jinlin, a young woman residing in Zhabei, who hired lawyer Pan Zhensheng to sue her husband, Wang Shou'an, for divorce in the local court, before the verdict was delivered, a man wearing a suit and glasses suddenly came to Gu Jinlin's house, claiming to be an investigator from the court and demanding an investigation fee of seven yuan and fifty cents, saying that he had also received the fee from Wang Shou'an's family. Gu Jinlin, being a woman, did not suspect anything and, lacking the money, borrowed it from her uncle, Mr. Gu. Her uncle, upon hearing this, found it strange, as the court never had the title of "investigator." He asked the man whether he had any official investigation documents. The man replied that he did not. He then asked if he had any court identification. The man replied that he did not bring it. Thus, it was proven that he was impersonating someone to commit fraud. He was immediately seized, and just as they were about to call the police, the man was completely embarrassed, his face flushed, and he repeatedly kowtowed and begged for mercy. As a result, Mr. Gu slapped him, and his glasses were knocked to the ground and shattered. The man fled in disgrace, and all the onlookers applauded with delight.</p>
<h3>Robbery in Lujiadu Last Night</h3>

In recent years, due to the booming business, he also runs a small gang of workers who unload foreign pine at various lumberyards. He has accumulated some savings, which has attracted the attention of bandits. At 7:45 PM last night, just as the heavy rain had stopped, Wang was sipping tea in a small teahouse nearby when two unfamiliar men came up to him and called him outside, claiming they wanted to go to Wang's house to discuss something. Unexpectedly, when Wang returned home, there were already three or four people standing at the door. They pushed him inside, displayed a handgun, and forbade him from making a sound. The bandits then rummaged through the chests and cabinets, robbing gold jewelry and silver dollars worth about two hundred yuan, and fled north. Before leaving, they fired two shots into the sky as a warning. One of the bandits dropped his straw hat on the ground due to the wind. As he bent down to pick it up, Mr. Zhang, who was enjoying the cool air, caught a glimpse of him, grabbed him, and handed him over to the police officer on duty, who took him to the Yangjiadu Police Station. That night, Director Yang summoned the victim, who confirmed the man's identity without error. According to the bandit, his name is Qiu Lizheng, 33 years old, from Shandong, with no fixed address. He also said that there was an accomplice named Zhang Yatu, who was hiding at No. 520 Xin Street, Dama Road, Nanshi. Yesterday morning, detectives Zhang Yanbiao and Cheng Peizhang were dispatched to arrest him, but he had already fled. The suspect Wang Yulin was taken to the station for detention and transferred to the General Bureau for questioning.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I read your newspaper on August 7th, in the local news section, there was a news item about five robbers touring the Great World. It said that the robber Xu Asan, from Ningbo, claimed to have opened a Ting Deli watch shop in Zhenjiang, etc., which is not in line with the facts. The wood shop has been open for many years, and there is no one named Xu among the shareholders, and there is no one named Xu Asan among the partners. This matter concerns the reputation of the store, and it is appropriate to request a correction. Sincerely, Zhenjiang Henglide, August 7th.</p>

<h3>National News: Boy Scout Inspection Postponed: To Be Held Next Year on Double Tenth Day</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 9th) The national Boy Scout inspection has been postponed to next year's Double Tenth Day due to funding issues.</p>
<h3>Free Education Funding Still Insufficient</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 9th) For the implementation of free education in various provinces and cities in the 24th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1935], according to the plans reported to the Ministry of Education by Lu Xin and 30 other provinces and cities, a total of 18 million yuan is required. The provinces themselves plan to raise 9 million yuan. In addition to the central government's subsidy of 2.4 million yuan, already allocated to the provinces, and 500,000 yuan for border education, and 800,000 yuan from the Boxer Indemnity, which are being considered for allocation, there is still a significant shortfall.</p>
<h3>Yunnan Divides Province into Twenty-Eight School Districts</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Kunming, 9th) The Department of Education has now divided the entire province into twenty-eight school districts, with each district designating a provincial school as the central school, in order to improve and promote education. This outline has been submitted to the provincial government and the Ministry of Education for record.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Order: Improvement of Private Universities and Colleges in Peiping and Tianjin</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued the following order on the 9th to private universities and colleges in Peiping and Tianjin, urging them to earnestly improve:</p>
<h3>Fu Jen University</h3>
<p>The order to Fu Jen Catholic University stated, "The school has been previously instructed by the Ministry to improve based on key points. According to the report of the inspectors this time, the research work of various departments in the College of Science and the Department of Chinese Literature in the College of Liberal Arts is commendable. However, there has been little improvement on the points mentioned in the Ministry's order. Therefore, the following are specifically listed, and compliance is required: 1. The school has limited funding and too many departments, making it difficult to achieve balanced development. The departments of Philosophy, Psychology, Education, and Social Economics should be promptly considered for consolidation and reported to the Ministry for approval. The teaching staff and equipment of the Art Specialization Program need to be supplemented. The curriculum outlines of each department should be promptly formulated and effectively implemented. 2. The school's teachers still consist mostly of part-time staff. Efforts should be made to increase the number of full-time staff and limit outside teaching. The research and investigation work of the Department of Chinese Literature must have the participation of domestic personnel and should cooperate with local national academic institutions to achieve greater results in the work. Therefore, you are ordered to earnestly improve and report accordingly."</p>
<h3>Yenching University</h3>
<p>The order to Yenching University stated, "The school has been previously instructed by the Ministry to improve based on key points. According to the report of the inspectors this time, the school has made considerable improvements on the points mentioned in the Ministry's order. The research work of the Biology Department is particularly commendable. However, the departments established by the school are still too numerous and should be further consolidated. The pre-medical and pre-nursing departments have not yet been discontinued, which is inappropriate. These departments must be terminated this year. The school's endowment should be actively raised to solidify its foundation. The extravagant habits of students still need to be corrected. Therefore, you are ordered to earnestly improve and report accordingly."</p>
<h3>Nankai University</h3>
<p>The order to Nankai University stated, "The school has been previously instructed by the Ministry to improve based on key points. According to the report of the inspectors this time, the school has generally paid attention to the points mentioned in the previous order, and there has been progress in other areas compared to before. However, the teaching staff of the Physics Department still needs to be strengthened, and the amount of equipment funds should also be increased. Therefore, you are ordered to comply with the improvement. This order."</p>
<h3>Sino-French University</h3>
<p>The order to Sino-French University stated, "The school has been previously instructed by the Ministry to improve based on key points. According to the report of the inspectors, the school has added 40,000 yuan worth of books and instruments in the past year, and the research work of the Physics and Chemistry Departments in the College of Science has achieved excellent results, all of which are commendable. The previous order to abolish the College of Social Sciences has also been complied with. However, there are still points that need to be improved, which are listed below: 1. After the College of Social Sciences was abolished, the original Departments of Philosophy and Social Sciences were assigned to the College of Liberal Arts. However, the students of these two departments are still receiving classes at the original location. The number of students in these two departments is not large, and they should be moved into the College after the summer vacation. The name of the Department of Social Sciences is too general, and the nature of the department should be determined, and the name should be changed accordingly. 2. The number of part-time teachers still accounts for the majority, and should be reduced as much as possible, and excellent full-time teachers should be hired. For teachers taking leave, strict make-up class measures should be established. 3. The equipment of the electromagnetics and wireless electricity laboratories should be strengthened, and important reference books and complete sets of journals for each department of the College of Science should also be added. Therefore, you are ordered to comply with and report accordingly."</p>
<h3>Chaoyang College</h3>
<p>The order to Chaoyang College stated, "The school has been previously instructed by the Ministry to improve based on key points. According to the report of the inspectors this time, the school has only made improvements in accounting and has added some books.</p>
<h3>Plan for Implementing Compulsory Education (Middle) (Lei Zhen's Broadcast Speech on the Central Radio Station)</h3>
<p>4. Funding</p>
<p>The funding for compulsory education is primarily the responsibility of the local authorities. In urban areas, it is coordinated by the municipal government, and in counties and cities within provinces, it is shared by the provincial and county governments in appropriate proportions. The central government may provide subsidies based on the conditions of the provinces and cities. As for remote and impoverished provinces, where fundraising is too difficult, the central government may provide special subsidies to ensure the widespread and smooth progress of compulsory education.</p>
<p>Now that the implementation of compulsory education has begun, various provinces are actively proceeding. According to the implementation plans reported by various provinces and cities, approximately 18 million yuan or more is required. The provinces plan to raise 9 million yuan themselves, which is far from enough. In addition to the 2.4 million yuan from the national treasury that can be used for subsidies, there is also 500,000 yuan for border education expenses and 800,000 yuan from the Boxer Indemnity allocated to compulsory education, which are also being considered for distribution. The numbers proposed by each province and city, the amounts they plan to raise themselves, and the amounts subsidized by the central government are reported separately below.</p>
<h3>List of Expenses for Implementing Compulsory Education in Various Provinces (Omitted)</h3>
<p>Other shortcomings have not been effectively improved. I will remind you again, and you must strictly abide by them, and report back for record. (1) The college's endowment and recurring expenses should be the responsibility of the board of directors to raise funds in order to increase financial resources. (2) In order to strictly manage training, efforts should be made to add student dormitories. (3) The content of the college's Department of Border Politics is quite empty and should be enriched. (4) The college's entrance examinations should strictly set admission standards, and would rather have vacancies than to admit unqualified students. Regular assessments must also be strictly distinguished in order to improve quality and increase the level of performance. (5) Among the college's seventy-one teachers, fifty-two of them have monthly salaries below one hundred yuan, which shows that there are many part-time teachers. In the future, the treatment should be increased appropriately, and the number of part-time staff should be reduced, and full-time teachers should be hired. (6) The college's dormitory kitchens and various sanitary facilities are very unclean and should be improved as soon as possible. This order."</p>
<h3>Ming Kuo College</h3>
<p>The order to Ming Kuo College stated, "The college has previously been prompted by this Ministry regarding the key points of improvement and has been ordered to comply with them and register them. Based on the reports of the inspectors this time, the college is considered to be serious in training and managing students, and the library equipment has also been slightly increased. However, the points of hiring full-time professors, increasing treatment, adding various equipment, improving student level, and enriching the content of disciplines have not been effectively improved, and the previous order should still be strictly followed. In addition, the endowment should be increased, the accounting system should be improved quickly, the office expenses should be reduced as much as possible within the expenditure budget, and the book expenses should be increased, and important college affairs should be discussed and decided by the college affairs conference. You are therefore ordered to earnestly comply and report back."</p>

<p>Issuing a Declaration</p>
<p>The Association, in order to promote children's welfare and arouse the attention of all sectors for Children's Year, hereby issues the following declaration: The nationally designated Children's Year has opened amidst cheers and celebrations across the country on August 1st. Observing the grand ceremonies held in various places and the enthusiastic donations, we are sincerely fortunate, which is enough to symbolize the importance that the people of the country attach to children's welfare. However, the significance of the establishment of Children's Year is by no means limited to the acquisition of this grand ceremony. The holding of the opening ceremony is only sufficient to express the nation's emphasis on the founding of children and its determination to work hard, and the tree of actual achievements still depends on future efforts. Otherwise, the establishment of Children's Year is no different from formal embellishment. What is the value of this move? Since the central government decided to implement the nationally designated Children's Year, in addition to the joint organization of the National Children's Year Implementation Committee by various departments to plan everything, the provincial and municipal governments have also organized local Children's Year Implementation Committees as the hub for promoting children's welfare undertakings. Not only is the organization strict and the system clear, but the preparations before the event have also undergone a long period of planning. Even in this city, the implementation committee has been established for a long time and has held many meetings. Although no specific plan has been promulgated yet and no actual projects have been held, the future will surely be gratifying to us. However, the construction of children's welfare undertakings is complicated. In order to promote and develop, in addition to the advocacy of the government, the entire people must concentrate their efforts and jointly assist. It is hoped that the crowd will easily accomplish it and the results can be seen. This city is the only major commercial port in our country, and it is also an area where humanities gather. The concept of cherishing children has not yet penetrated every citizen, but the perception of all sectors of society should not lack wise men. If we can all rise up to assist the existing children's welfare national system, earnestly seek to increase children's welfare, and give it practical support, then the future of children's undertakings in this city will undoubtedly be able to achieve greater achievements. Our Association, as one of the children's welfare organizations in this city, has exhausted its meager efforts to promote the establishment of Children's Year, and has even deeper hopes after the establishment of Children's Year. Therefore, in addition to suggesting that the Municipal Children's Year Implementation Committee expedite the holding of actual projects, we sincerely hope that all sectors of the city will do their best to jointly seek the promotion of children's welfare and complete the mission of Children's Year. This Association dares to speak for the children of the whole city. This is a declaration to be reviewed.</p>

<h3>Little Men (10)</h3>
<p>—Original by American author Louisa May Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang (Zonghai)</p>
<p>Their conversation had reached Mrs. Bhaer's ears, but she seemed to be only concentrating on pouring milk and taking care of little Tandy. At that time, poor Serba was already drowsy. He had already put his spoon to his eyes, nodding like a poppy in the wind. Finally, he leaned his cheek on a piece of soft bread and fell sound asleep. The reason why Mrs. Bhaer placed Nat next to Tommy was because the fat, short boy was amiable and easygoing, so shy people liked to be close to him. Nat also felt this, and during dinner, he said a few heartfelt words to him, which seemed to give Mrs. Bhaer a way to know the boy's character, which was far better than talking to him herself.</p>
<p>In Mr. Lawrance's letter of introduction for Nat, he wrote:</p>
<p>Dear Mrs. Bhaer,——Here is something that suits your heart. This poor boy is now an orphan, poor and helpless. He has been playing music on the street to make a living. I found him in a cellar, mourning his deceased father and his lost violin. I think he can be made to do something, so I thought we could give this little one a helping hand. You heal his tired body, and Fritz helps his wasted mind. After he succeeds, let me see if he is a genius or just has some talent, and he can have a skill to avoid freezing and starving. Give him a chance, if only for your own boy, 'Tandy.'"</p>
<p>Mrs. Bhaer read the letter and exclaimed, "Of course we are willing"! When she saw Nat, she immediately felt that whether he was a genius or not, what he needed was a child with poverty and sickness, and what he needed was her willing, to be a family and a mother's general protection. She and Mr. Bhaer were secretly observing him. They felt that although he was wearing ragged clothes, had a dirty face, and acted unnaturally, he had many lovable qualities. He was a twelve-year-old boy with a pale, thin face and blue eyes. Under his loose, unkempt hair, he had a broad forehead. His face sometimes showed a look of anxiety, as if he was about to be scolded or beaten. His lips were very sensitive. When someone treated him with kindness, he would smile slightly. Gentle words immediately caused a look of gratitude, which made people very lovable. When Tommy mentioned the music team, Mrs. Bhaer immediately saw that eager and happy expression on his face, and she said to herself, "This poor little darling, if he likes it, he can play the violin all day long."</p>

<p>Zhang Zhijiang to Visit Europe, America, and Southeast Asia to Promote National Martial Arts and Study Physical Education</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday and Scheduled to Depart by Ship on the 13th; Accompanied by Four National Martial Arts Institute Advisors</p>
<p>(Shanghai Times Agency Report) Zhang Zhijiang, member of the Central Committee and Director of the Central National Martial Arts Institute, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday to prepare for his trip. He is scheduled to depart on the President Coolidge on the 13th of this month.</p>
<h3>Study Physical Education Abroad</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Zhang, he has always believed that the strength of a nation depends primarily on the physical fitness of its people. Therefore, the promotion of national martial arts and physical education in our country is essential for rescuing our national crisis. In particular, national martial arts are a skill in which our country excels, and there is a need to promote and develop them. He had previously resolved to travel abroad to promote Chinese martial arts internationally and to study the actual conditions of physical education in Europe and America, hoping to learn from their strengths and make up for our shortcomings so that our country's physical education and national martial arts can be improved.</p>
<h3>Performing Martial Arts in Europe, America, and Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>He is scheduled to depart on the President Coolidge on the 13th of this month, bound for America. His entourage includes Mr. Luo Jiezhi and Peng Shu, advisors to the National Martial Arts Institute; Luo Guanghai, staff member of the Overseas Department of the Central Party Headquarters; and Shi Yufang, a pastor from the Presbyterian Church. The trip is expected to last six months, but may be slightly extended if necessary. After arriving in America, he will travel to various European countries, including England, Germany, and France. On his way back to China, he plans to make some stops in Southeast Asia. During his travels in Europe and America, he plans to perform national martial arts at any time so that people in Europe and America can understand the true meaning of Chinese martial arts. When he arrives in Southeast Asia, he will telegraph back to China to organize national martial arts and basketball teams to participate in joint performances.</p>
<h3>Aviation and Swimming Competition to Be Held This Afternoon at Liangjiang</h3>
<p>The aviation and swimming competition will be held this afternoon at 4 PM at the Liangjiang Swimming Pool. Chairman Wang Xiaolai has been invited to dive into the water, and Dr. Mei Lanfang and movie star Hu Die have been invited to attend. Principal Lu Lihua of Liangjiang, in order to ensure the success of the competition, has suspended all Liangjiang discount tickets previously issued for that day. However, due to the uncertain weather in the past two days, with alternating rain and sunshine, it has been decided that the event will be postponed if it rains.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Club to Host Nanyang Cup Open Singles Tournament</h3>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Microorganism)</p>
<p>An extremely weak melon vine can bear a "bucket-sized" watermelon, unafraid of wind and rain. A tall ginkgo tree, on the other hand, bears only tiny white fruit, which falls off after a single night of wind and rain. This is just like how wealthy families often have few children, while families with difficult lives often have many.</p>
<p>The commercial field is like a gambling den. When natives buy native goods, it is like family members playing mahjong. The money won and lost still doesn't leave the house. But if natives buy foreign goods, it is as if a few foreigners have joined the game. If we win, that's fine, but if we lose, doesn't the money immediately leave the house? Furthermore, there is still hope of winning at gambling, but this is simply a case of losing without winning, how frightening!</p>
<h3>Mysterious Night</h3>
<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>It really is like a play; as soon as the dignified "main character" leaves the stage, the clownish "night" jumps out.</p>
<p>Night, no matter how naturally dark it may be, can be illuminated with the light of electric torches, and sometimes it can even be painted with red, green, blue, purple… all sorts of different colors. Women whose faces look withered and yellow in the daytime become very beautiful at night; members of the privileged class who spend their days listlessly in bed (note… "gun" here refers to an opium pipe) become full of energy at night; the taverns and teahouses are filled with moralistic gentlemen who lecture their sons on "abstaining from wine and women"; the dance halls are packed with scholars who have undergone training in the morning – preparing to sacrifice themselves for the country; clerks in foreign firms and shop assistants, dragging their tired bodies after a day of hard work, send their day's wages into the dog racing tracks and jai alai courts without hesitation… these are the various scenes that unfold in the city at night: night can help make faces beautiful, night can help make people full of energy, night can make people change all normal states.</p>
<p>Night, how truly mysterious!</p>
<p>But the light that seems so bright at night becomes dim under the sun; the woman who looks so beautiful at night, like the lamplight, dares not be put under the sun.</p>
<h3>Slippers</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>Slippers, whether worn by the "upper class" or the "lower class," are loved by everyone. Especially during this summer season, after work, one feels that slippers are indispensable.</p>
<p>The uppers of slippers can be very elaborate. White satin embroidered with red flowers and green leaves, and adorned with one or two lifelike black butterflies, is naturally the most beautiful. Of course, slippers with such beautiful uppers, worn on the feet of a young playboy, are most likely to attract attention, and people will ask mysteriously, "Who is the lover who gave you these slippers?"</p>
<p>In recent years, the use of silk thread embroidery on slipper uppers has gradually decreased, and most now use beads. Some are embroidered with cross-stitch, but I feel that it doesn't quite match the richness and elegance of white satin silk embroidery.</p>
<p>However, this year, general shoe stores are displaying large quantities of leather slippers, marked at "one yuan per pair," or even eighty cents per pair. Thus, the beaded and cross-stitched slippers that had overthrown the white satin embroidered slippers have now been defeated. Among ten slipper wearers, regardless of gender, age, wealth, or status, at least eight or nine are wearing leather slippers. Shoe store owners might shout "Long live leather slippers!"</p>
<p>Yesterday, at a certain company, I saw a pair of high-heeled women's slippers, with heels a full inch and a half high. I couldn't help but feel somewhat emotional. I feel that the original purpose of wearing slippers is simply for comfort. To wear slippers with such high heels in the name of comfort, what's the point?</p>

<h3>Goring's Letter</h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>The Goring here is not a place name, but a person's name; not the German Goring, but the Chinese Goring. Separating the two characters, Ge refers to Ge Gongzhen, and Lin refers to Lin Yutang. Readers should know: one is a famous reporter, and the other is a famous writer. Their relationship is that of old friends for many years, not just casual acquaintances. Recently, because of a postscript to an article in "Ren Jian Shi" (Human World), "Lin" said a few words that caused "Ge" unhappiness. "Ge" sent a letter from overseas, in which he defends himself to "Lin" with humorous wording. It is specially introduced to readers:</p>
<p>'Mr. Yutang: Long time no see, I often enjoy reading your journals while abroad. I recently read your postscript to "A Reporter's Career" in the 28th issue of "Ren Jian Shi," in which you criticized me. Because it is contrary to the facts, I dare not remain silent. You have been in the publishing industry for a long time, and should know that today's Chinese newspapers do not yet have the world perspective of the *New York Times*, which is willing to spend huge sums of money to select talented people and station them abroad to seek the latest news and information. You have also been in the writing world for a long time, and should also know that today's Chinese magazines are very cautious in their selection of materials and dare not publish articles about Soviet writers. I have tried and failed, and am not exaggerating. Therefore, my trip to the Soviet Union was entirely out of personal interest and was not at someone's behest. I could not seek Duranty's position where he could write the truth as he saw it, and I could not seek a newspaper like Duranty's that could publish whatever he wanted.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are already many books about the Soviet Union in China. Although I am unwilling to write travelogues or translations again, I must personally witness things before I write about them. In recent years, the following articles have been scattered in "Shenghuo Zhoukan" (Life Weekly), "Xinsheng Zhoukan" (New Life Weekly), "Guowen Zhoubao" (National News Weekly), "Shijie Zhishi" (World Knowledge), and "Shidai Huabao" (The China Illustrated Review):</p>
<p>The Second Five-Year Plan, Electric City, Oil City, Iron City, and Charcoal City, The so-called Social City, The Soviet National Day, The Seventh General Election, The Tenth Anniversary of Lenin's Death, Military Parade and Sports Parade, Fifteen Years of Soviet Art.</p>
<p>The above are all the more meaningful ones, and other miscellaneous works are not included. I believe that this is purely my own effort, hoping to contribute to the people of the country. If it were for the sake of earning money, then only two or three yuan per thousand words, you should know it even better. Several months of hard work may not even be enough to pay for a day's travel expenses. "The words of a humble man are insignificant," what is so strange about that? But you edit newspapers without reading them, I cannot but blame you, sir. Gongzhen bows and writes, Vienna, June 29th.'</p>
<h3>Small Western Heaven</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 17: Don't Ask a Daughter's Body Difficult to Speak Hidden Pain Compete to See Noble People Encoffined Together Admire Noble Demeanor</p>
<p>Huanhua nodded and said, "Goodbye." She couldn't care less about where You stood, and turned to go inside. When she got to the backyard, she saw Cheng Zhiqian looking out through the glass window from afar. So she stopped smiling, put on a melancholy face, and went to the room. Zhiqian smiled and said, "Miss Yang is enthusiastic again afterwards, she must have gone there for a turn." Huanhua sighed and said, "Mr. Cheng, you really are a good person, the more I think about your words, the more I regret it. I regret being the matchmaker so much." As she spoke, she pressed her hands on the edge of the table, looking at Zhiqian, as if waiting for Zhiqian's comfort. Zhiqian then smiled and said, "Speaking of which, this matter cannot be blamed on any one person, and moreover, his family was originally willing to do so." As he spoke, he poured a cup of tea and handed it to Huanhua. She smiled and thanked him, and sat down, describing Yueying's appearance in detail, naturally all on the side of sympathy. Later, Zhiqian said that the end of a woman with a weak will was nothing more than this, Huanhua was silent, and then tears flowed down her face. After a long time, she wiped her tears, lowered her head, and said, "If all men had a heart like Mr. Cheng, women could travel all over the world and not be fooled." Zhiqian smiled and said, "Miss Yang said such a thing, I can't take it seriously. But I am a poor scholar, and there is no talk of any enjoyment. I know how to be content with my lot and dare not have any delusions. A person who is content with his lot will naturally not harm women. If I had a hundred thousand or eight hundred thousand, living in a palace-like house and riding in the latest model car, then I would naturally marry three or four concubines." (286)</p>
<h3>Records of the Fragrant Imperial Past</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>They all flew very low, and some almost brushed their wings across the water's surface; in front of us, countless lotus leaves rose and fell to the left and right with the gusts of dawn wind; the tiny waves stirred up by the lake would sometimes submerge them all together, but soon they would struggle back up, swaying so that the water on the leaves would become round dots and fall down, looking like glittering pearls in the not-so-bright morning light.</p>
<p>Everyone was silent, there was no sound anywhere, as silent as in the middle of the desert; the entire Summer Palace, not a single light could be seen, as if it were still asleep. It was really funny that we were all out so early today, as if we were doing something secret. Actually, I really don't understand what the Empress Dowager meant by telling us to get up so early today and follow her to the lake: I don't dare be sure whether others have understood it. But the Empress Dowager's expression was very calm and composed—because she herself already knew what kind of adventure was about to be discovered: I saw that there was indeed some mysterious expression on her face, and it seemed that she was still thinking about something. Her eyes were either looking at that large pile of lotus leaves, or raised to look at the sky to the east.</p>
<p>"Everyone pay attention!" she suddenly said to us in a low voice again: "A rare sight will appear before your eyes! When the sun rises, watch carefully, all the unopened lotus buds will bloom in an instant!" (386)</p>
<p>Character Vignettes</p>
<h3>The Nobility of Hitler's Sister</h3>
<p>— Special</p>
<p>The world-renowned and globally influential German leader Hitler has a sister who, by common sense, is also a noble person. But she does not think of climbing the social ladder, but stays away from her brother and lives in seclusion in a foreign country. This noble personality is beyond the reach of today's modern wives and misses, and some people may even say that she is eccentric.</p>
<p>This is Ms. Paula Hitler, who is thirty-eight years old this year and still a spinster. She lives in seclusion in Vienna, Austria, and quietly watches her brother display his heroic talents and great plans. She only goes to Germany once a year to visit her brother, and only stays for a few weeks before returning. Hitler once said that if his "doctrine" succeeds and makes his relatives rich and prosperous, that would be an immoral act. Ms. Paula agrees with this very much, and it can truly be said that like brother, like sister.</p>
<p>Ms. Paula often says to her friends: she would be happier than anything else if she could support herself again one day. She used to work in an insurance company writing envelopes, and her monthly salary was very meager, barely enough to live on. Two years ago, she was suddenly fired, and she ran around trying to find a new job, but she couldn't. She deliberately misspelled her name, but eventually people found out that she was the sister of the leader of the National Socialist Party, and she lost her job at the insurance company because of this. Later, no business dared to hire her anymore, so she had to rely on her brother's allowance to live. She was very sad to be dependent on others. Her brother's allowance was about sixty or seventy yuan a month, taken in installments, each time about ten yuan or so.</p>
<p>She originally lived in a small dilapidated house in the heart of the city, which was very uncomfortable. Three months ago, she moved to near the Wahring district, where many residents belong to the National Socialist Party. Through the introduction of a friend, she rented two rooms in a new building, with a separate kitchen and bathroom, which was much more spacious than before.</p>
<p>In addition to paying a monthly rent of fourteen yuan for this new house, she also subsidized the construction cost of five hundred yuan. This sum, and the cost of adding some furniture, were all provided by her brother.</p>
<p>Although she registered using her real name, her neighbors only know her as Mrs. Wolf. The reason why she wanted to hide it from them was because, in the place she used to live, there were often uninvited guests who came to pester her endlessly, so she wanted to avoid this trouble. Later, an indiscreet newspaper published her new address in the newspaper, so many people went to visit her, and she had to take refuge in a friend's house for a week. She has received thousands of letters, some asking her to intercede with her brother's actions, some full of flattery, and some full of abuse, all three types of letters are what she hates.</p>
<p>This sister of the leader who holds the power of Germany, does not hire a servant at home, and takes care of all the housework herself. Sometimes, when a reporter rings the doorbell, they see a woman with simple clothes, a strong physique, tanned hands, and jet-black hair come to answer the door. At a glance, it is known that she is Hitler's sister. She only opens the door a crack, and when the guest asks if Mrs. Wolf is at home, she firmly replies, "Madam is not at home, I don't know when she will be back." When the guest tries to ask another question, the door slams shut.</p>
<p>Ms. Paula loves to live quietly and rarely chats with her neighbors. The only people she usually meets are a few friends, two middle-aged women and a man, who is the one who found her the new house.</p>
<p>Ms. Paula returns to Germany once a year and spends a few weeks with her brother, but she also lives in seclusion. Her whereabouts are never made public. When she lives in Germany, she only spends her time with the wives of her brother's most trusted comrades.</p>
<p>Hitler also has a foster sister named Raba Shuz, who lives in Germany for a long time. She and Ms. Paula never appear in public. This kind of virtue is truly commendable!</p>

<h3>Finance News Favorable to Buyers, Gold Bar Premiums Replay a Five Yuan Surge</h3>
<p>However, large holders are selling, and the situation has eased.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market rose again after falling. Despite efforts by firms such as Da De Cheng to increase supply, the tight foreign exchange market prevailed. Positive news helped create a situation where demand exceeded supply in the trading floor, causing the price to soar to 918.8 yuan. Eventually, it stabilized. Initially, overseas silver markets saw British prices rise and American prices remain flat. Mont de Piété forward silver prices increased by five hao, and foreign exchange rates rose slightly. London raw gold increased by one penny. Although the market sentiment was initially weak, pre-market trading opened and immediately retreated to 023 yuan, then rose again to 034 yuan. The situation fluctuated. The Central Bank's announced exchange rates showed both British and American prices unchanged, and the customs gold unit also remained the same. The gold bar premium standard price rose to 920.4 yuan, but this had little impact. After opening, selling pressure remained strong, once approaching the 900 yuan mark. Large holders supported the market at the low, and prices soon rebounded. Chinese merchants attempted to purchase US dollars but failed, leading to a surge, but the price did not exceed the 10 yuan mark. Banks released some supply, slightly easing the downstream pressure. However, due to the HSBC exchange rates, both British and American prices remained flat, leading to much struggle after the initial decline. Subsequently, banks scrambled to settle their positions, and the foreign exchange market tightened, pushing the price above the 10 yuan mark. Despite much fluctuation, large holders continued to buy, further tightening the domestic foreign exchange market, and igniting buying interest in the trading floor, once pushing the price to 916 yuan. Banks took advantage of the high prices to release supply, and sellers became active, gradually pushing the price down. There was much contention along the way, but eventually, market sentiment weakened slightly, and predictions of a one anna increase in Indian silver led to a retreat within the 10 yuan mark. Large holders also released supply, and the market weakened at noon. The afternoon market opened flat, and although there was political news, it was unrelated to the gold market. Therefore, the market opened peacefully, and buyers, after a period of inactivity, became active, pushing the price back above the 10 yuan mark, restoring prosperity. The first telegraphic report from Indian silver showed an increase of two annas, but there was still a possibility of reversal. Then, Associated Press reported that Sir Otto Niemeyer, the British government's economic advisor to the Far East, would depart tomorrow and had issued a statement: (1) hoping China would join the sterling bloc, and (2) news of Anglo-Japanese cooperation, stimulating a surge. However, because the telegram also mentioned promoting international loans to China, there was still fluctuation. Later, the Hong Kong market reported weakness, and Indian silver retraced slightly, increasing again to 918.8 yuan. Banks continued to release supply, and sellers surged again, eventually settling slightly. Overall, although the day's trend resulted in an increase, large holders sold off a significant amount, and the situation on the trading floor has eased, making a retreat easier. The day's market conditions are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Chinese Merchants Continue to Buy; Foreign Exchange Eases and then Turns Tight</h3>
<p>Banks Strenuously Sell Amidst Much Fluctuation</p>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign telegram from London, the long term was flat, and the short term rose by 0.0625. New York silver markets remained unchanged. Mont de Piété forward silver prices rose by five hao. London raw gold rose by one penny. British currency rose against the American currency by 0.25, British currency remained unchanged against the French currency, American currency rose against British currency by 0.25, and American currency rose against French currency by 0.25. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with recent term selling prices: British currency at one shilling, five pennies, and nine thousand three hundred and seventy-five, and American currency at thirty-seven yuan and one hundred and twenty-five. Compared to the previous close, British currency was 0.0625 lower, and American currency was 0.1875 higher. The Central Bank's announced exchange rates showed both British and American prices unchanged, and the customs gold unit remained the same, with little impact. After opening, there was a market without business. However, because Chinese merchants took advantage of the low prices to buy, prices soon rebounded. Although Zhejiang and Pan Gen released supply, prices fluctuated because HSBC's announced exchange rates remained unchanged. After entering the market, banks continued to absorb supply, and prices gradually tightened again. A sudden buying spree by Chinese merchant tycoons further tightened the market. Banks took advantage of the high prices to release supply, and the situation began to stabilize. After entering the market, Chinese merchants' sentiment weakened slightly, and predictions of a one anna increase in Indian silver caused the market to harden. Banks' willingness to sell also surged. The afternoon market opened flat. Banks continued to buy long-term American dollars, maintaining prices. Market sentiment rebounded. However, after the first report from Indian silver showed an increase of two annas, the market remained uncertain. Later, Associated Press reported that Sir Otto Niemeyer, who was dispatched by Britain to China to investigate the economic situation, expressed that China should join the sterling bloc. Indian silver retraced slightly and prices tightened. Banks took advantage of the high prices to sell, and the market then stabilized slightly. The recent term selling prices at the close of business were British currency at one shilling, five pennies, and seven thousand five hundred, and American currency at thirty-six yuan and seventy-five. Compared to the previous close, British currency was 0.0125 higher, and American currency was 0.1875 lower. Chinese merchants bought approximately 100,000 pounds in sterling and 300,000 in US dollars. The day's transactions are recorded below:</p>

<h3>After Careful Transactions, the Flow of Silver Dollars is Particularly Difficult</h3>
<p>This year, due to the decline of rural areas and the withering of urban areas in the Shanghai market, a consistent and cautious approach has been adopted, refusing to lend excessively, resulting in various obstacles and the impact of financial stagnation for all Shanghai merchants. Recently, the market has again suffered from floods and natural disasters in various places, with man-made disasters following closely behind, making it difficult for the market to recover. Therefore, currently, banks are only slightly accommodating to old customers, while other ordinary customers are largely restricted and not provided loans. Cash shops, regardless of new or old customers, are adopting a contractionary approach, making the market even more unbearable and the flow of funds particularly difficult. As a result, there is consistently no competition for interbank loaning of silver dollars in the market. The market price of two jiao every morning and afternoon has remained for more than a month. Yesterday also followed the old pattern, with no added interest and no activity. Although there was some slight fluctuation in the Small Exchange Association, it was only a few fen up or down. The volume of interbank loaning of silver dollar notes was similar to the previous few days, with over 3.2 million transferred in the morning market, over 200,000 in new transactions, and over 200,000 in transactions in the afternoon market. Transactions in the Small Exchange Association were 300,000 to 400,000, with over 500,000 banknotes recovered, 700,000 in circulating notes issued, 800,000 in secret marked notes, 400,000 in silver dollar collateral transactions redeemed, 500,000 in new loans made, 150,000 in inbound and outbound passenger loans, 45 million in public silver dollar bills received and settled by cash shops, 5.2 million in silver dollar interbank loans received and settled, 500,000 in various remittances, and 300,000 to 400,000 in cash received. Additionally, Japanese banks had an inflow of funds of approximately several million, but the exact amount is unknown. However, after checking the Japanese banks' settlements, it was not included, suggesting that there was another type of settlement not included. Foreign banks received and settled 1.7 to 1.8 million in bill payments, 3.0 million in various goods, remittances, collateral, and miscellaneous payments, 500,000 in telegraphic transfers, 500,000 in foreign exchange settlement payments, 800,000 in re-remittances, and 400,000 in warehouse entries. Chinese banks received and settled over 2.0 million in bill payments, 3.7 to 3.8 million in various goods, remittances, taxes, collateral, and miscellaneous payments, 400,000 in telegraphic transfers, 800,000 in special remittances, 700,000 in foreign exchange settlement payments, and 300,000 in warehouse exits. Japanese banks received and settled over 2.1 million in bill payments, 4.5 to 4.6 million in various goods and miscellaneous payments, 700,000 in foreign exchange settlement payments, 500,000 in special remittances, 500,000 in telegraphic transfers, and 400,000 in warehouse exits. Given the current state of the city, silver money businesses are unwilling to relax, and the situation is expected to become tighter day by day.</p>
<p>Recently, due to the tight money supply and difficulty in circulation, there has been little enthusiasm for transactions of subsidiary coins. Jiangnan small silver dollars remained at 835 yuan in the morning market, same as the afternoon before, with no transactions reported. The afternoon market was slightly higher by five jiao, at 835.5 yuan, with only 2,000 units traded. Guangdong small silver dollars were 735.7 yuan in the morning market, and changed by two jiao in the afternoon market, to 735.5 yuan, resulting in a price increase of five jiao compared to the afternoon before, with 145,000 units traded in the morning market and 55,000 units in the afternoon market. Copper coins retraced by 1,500 wen, to 341,500 wen, with 37,565 strings traded, equivalent to 11,000 silver dollars.</p>
<p>Additionally, the total amount of bill exchanges in the city was 10,036,2521.4 silver dollars, including 4,731,220 silver dollars in total exchanges, 3,380,388.02 silver dollars in remittances, 1,615,196.03 silver dollars in total collections by money shops, and 635,717.35 silver dollars in other collections.</p>
<h3>Securities There is a possibility that 96 public bonds will exceed the 11 yuan mark</h3>
<p>Suddenly, a large number of Nian bonds were bought; only retail investors were trading other bonds.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange saw a relatively stable market situation. Although there was not much enthusiastic buying, the need was slightly higher due to a decrease in trading volume, leading to an increase in market prices. Numbers 20, 21, and 34, among others, saw significant buying, while Northern groups mostly sold. The market situation was generally leaning towards large long positions, but neither side took action. Long positions in number 48 are expected to continue to rise temporarily unless they break out of the pattern. Trading was extremely slow, with mostly retail investors trading, creating a livelier atmosphere. The trend was stable and consistent, more so than the previous day. The market generally trended slightly higher throughout the day. Numbers 20 and 21 were bought in the morning, with gold short positions increasing by a maximum of 0.35 yuan. Number 34 saw stronger buying in the second half, raising prices by 0.35 yuan, while the Northern groups continued to sell, causing market prices to continue rising, with the 23rd series rising by a maximum of 0.35 yuan. The 96 public bonds suddenly saw a large amount of buying by number 30, causing them to turn upwards again, with the potential to break through the 11 yuan mark. The situation was firm and bullish, and a relatively large surge may be seen before a slight pullback occurs. The result of yesterday's market prices was a rebound of 0.15 to 0.5 yuan. The total transaction volume was 8,185,000 yuan. The results of the increases and decreases are listed below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3>Grain Customers are drawing in this month's flour</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market closed near the same point. Quotations for foreign wheat, Chicago was down 0.2 jiao and Canadian wheat was down 0.04. Market sentiment was stable since foreign wheat barely fluctuated and no large transactions took place, prices of all months were fluctuating around the same point. This month, since factories were not selling, customers were slightly drawing, The market was very stable, and since spot wheat remained strong, it attracted attention to near months, The remote months saw little selling or buying, with a slight easing trend, Observing the next move, If demand picks up, the near months may continue to be bullish, As a result, this month was 0.075 better than the previous day, September was 0.025 better, October was unchanged, November/December were down 0.025, January was unchanged,</p>
<h3>Lack of New Wheat Chips in the Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market, at the opening in the morning, showed a slight decline in all months. Due to the quoted price of foreign wheat being between 4.25 and 2.00, the opening prices for each month were down by 2.3 points compared to the previous day. Trading volume was also unusually light. However, in the afternoon, trading became more active, and market sentiment stabilized somewhat. This was mainly due to a real lack of new chips in the market, with very few domestic dealers selling off their holdings, resulting in limited trading and price fluctuations. As a result, prices for the current month through October decreased by 0.1 point, while November rose by 0.1 point. The wheat market is currently stable. Yesterday, there was a shortage of high-quality goods available, and transactions mainly involved wheat from various parts of Jiangbei. It is estimated that Fuxin sold 60 bags and Fufeng sold 4,000 bags.</p>

<p>The Condition of the Foreign Rice Market is Worn Out – Quanzhou Dealers Continue to Handle Foreign Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday, the source of this rice (Shanghai South) for various dealers arrived at the 15th and 16th (a total of more than 3,000 stones). Sales in this street market remain sluggish, and wholesalers have even stopped operations, making the situation even clearer. Market sentiment shows another downturn, with prices falling by 0.1-0.2 yuan. Given this unfavorable environment, the future market seems to be shaky. Dongxin originally maintained its old position, but secretly changed to Yuan Pingding, Yang also.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, goods from various river routes arrived at the 18th and 19th. Various goods in the market have disappeared from wholesale. White rice is weak and prices are down by nearly 0.1 yuan. Early rice sales are active, and prices are stable. Thin rice is slow-moving in small quantities, with prices fluctuating slightly. White Yuan is down by 0.1 yuan. Due to the sudden changes in the weather from cloudy to sunny, the amount of glutinous rice arriving is small, about 600 stones. Small quantities are selling actively, and market prices are stable. Several dozens of stones of new Zhejiang Ning sharp rice have arrived, and retail sales are still considered decent, with prices opening at 8.6 yuan. The prices of other goods are soft.</p>
<p>The foreign rice market situation, after opening in the morning, with the gradual listing of new indica rice from various places, the trading volume of water carriers is decreasing day by day, people's hearts are soft, and hoarders generally have the intention to sell. Therefore, there is a downward trend in all grades, because the taste of this street is still fragrant, and Nanjing and various domestic dealers continue to inquire, and Quanzhou dealers have previously tried to do a pilot scheme, continue to inquire, a severe flood occurred in Quanzhou, resulting in huge losses to agricultural production, future desulfurization may gradually become prosperous, so people's hearts are again looking forward to the good, the rice market then turned station. However, only 2,700 bags of Saigon, 1,250 bags of Siam, and 700 bags of Xiao Jiao Min Dai were traded throughout the day, and no other transactions were completed.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Soybean Cake Factories Shutting Down</h3>
<p>— New Soybeans Continue to Fall by 0.4-0.5 Points —</p>
<p>Soybean cake market conditions, because Guangdong Province added a flour (Guangdong refers to soybean cake peanut cake) (class) tax, each load drawn 0.25 yuan, resulting in reduced wholesale, people's hearts weakening, market prices suddenly fell, but now it is the actual sales time for the Mid-Autumn Festival, this belongs to the sluggish, and the market rumors, factories have a shutdown, the general hoarding household took the opportunity to search for entry, market prices may temporarily be no honor or disgrace. Yesterday the mayor of the German factory four-brand cake still opened 1.3 yuan, because the factory products, compared to other homes of high quality, and the weight is adequate, the other more than others only open 1.28-9 yuan, the source of new beans endless, out of the way is not smooth, resulting in the city continued to fall 0.4-0.5 points, totaling the turnover of Changzhou Lingkou cowhide yellow 320 bags, the price of 3.74-7 yuan, Ganzhou Chengmen beans 350 bags, the price from 3.7-6.1 yuan, Gan Liufang Pond beans 26 bags, the price of 3.65 yuan.</p>

<h3>Installation of Automatic Volume Leveler</h3>
<p>— KMK</p>
<p>The automatic volume control in the radio is dedicated to adjusting uneven volume. Because the radio waves emitted from each broadcasting station in the sky and the stratum have different power, the sound received by the radio varies with the strength of the power, resulting in uneven highs and lows. In some cases, the power of two radio stations is the same, but the volume differs greatly. The former is because the radio itself lacks the ability to equalize and supplement, while the latter is mostly due to the quality of the environment and the proximity of the distance. This drawback of the radio is extremely annoying when listening. If receiving broadcasts from nearby or powerful radio stations, the volume feels loud, sharp, and ear-piercing, or it disturbs and obscures broadcasts from other radio stations. Conversely, when receiving broadcasts from distant or weak radio stations, the volume is too low or the disadvantage of sometimes high and sometimes low. Even if there is a volume control device, it can only avoid strong volume, but it cannot make the low volume loud. For these reasons, the radio needs to be innovated and improved in terms of volume. In the new imported radios imported into our country in recent years, almost all have this automatic volume controller, but most of them are equipped with external difference devices, while ordinary and small ones are still rare. As for what is described in this article, it is installed in an ordinary small (TRF) radio. If readers feel that the volume of the radio is uneven, they can try it according to Figure 1. Fortunately, the parts are simple to obtain, so it should not cause any difficulty.</p>
<p>The automatic volume leveler is achieved by combining a triode vacuum tube and several depletion resistors, because this work must be completed at the same time as detection. Therefore, a dual-screen compound vacuum tube is used for this work (see the second 55 vacuum tube in the figure), with the triode part as the automatic volume leveler and the dual screen as the half-wave detector. The line uses a self-detection method to prevent the detection work from tending to weaken. In heterodyne radios, the screen detection method is mostly used, because it is the second detection, so it is not as important as ordinary ones. As for the numerical values of other components, the attached figure has detailed instructions, so there is no need to repeat them.</p>
<h3>Ultra-Shortwave Transceiver</h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>Ultra-shortwave, what a fascinating term. Today, it is still only like a treasure trove rich in deposits, waiting for people to work hard to develop and excavate it! "Experiment" is like the only tool for excavation!</p>
<p>In the recent past, the Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory of Harvard University near Boston, USA, and the radio station set up by the American Amateur Radio League on a small hilltop near Hartford City, conducted two-and-a-half-meter wavelength communications. The test was successful, and the communication distance was 144 kilometers! Breaking all previous records! As for future development, it is exactly what is expected!</p>
<p>Comrades, based on the spirit of amateur research, mission, and hard work, let's experiment more and excavate this mysterious treasure - ultra-shortwave!</p>
<p>Here, two of the most affordable transceivers are introduced, willing to contribute to the comrades for reference!</p>
<p>The machine shown in the first figure is widely used. Two vacuum tubes are used in the machine. During reception, it acts as a detector and low-frequency amplifier. During transmission, it acts as an oscillator and amplitude modulator. Transmission and reception are managed by a four-pole double-throw switch - located at 1 to transmit, located at 2 to receive. T is a specially made low-frequency amplitude modulation dual-purpose transformer, and T is an output transformer-modulation choke.</p>
<p>Each coil LLr is wound with five turns of 14-gauge enameled wire with a diameter of 5 points, and L2 is wound with two turns. Capacitor C2 is a three-piece small variable capacitor. All fixed capacitors in the machine must be insulated with mica sheets. When this machine is used normally, connect a 4-foot or 8-foot long antenna to point A. A1 is used to connect a specially made Pikart (Diokord) antenna.</p>
<p>The network in the second figure is a relatively new transceiver. In the machine, LL1 coils are wound with 6 turns of 14-gauge enameled wire each, with a diameter of 4 points and a length of 6 points. C is an ordinary compensation capacitor, CH is a center-tapped low-impedance coil, or it can be replaced by a one-to-one low-frequency transformer in series. The high-impedance RFC is wound with 60 turns of 22-gauge double-yarn wrapped on a 3-point diameter tube.</p>
<p>When receiving, switch S is located at 2; when transmitting, it is located at 1.</p>
<p>The length of the antenna is the same as the previous machine.</p>
<p>The feature of this model is that during transmission, amplitude-modulated telecommunications can be listened to by the earpiece PH, without relying on other auxiliary modulators to distinguish its advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<h3>Television and Shortwave</h3>
<p>— Pao</p>
<p>Although current television has evolved from the experimental laboratory stage to the practical stage, it is actually full of obstacles and needs to be continuously tested to achieve perfection. Television sets that rely solely on mechanical action no longer have research value and have to be replaced by cathode-ray tube types. However, the television in nature - the human eye - does not need to go through the "scanning" procedure at all, and the clarity of the image and the convenience of operation are far better than current television sets. Therefore, future television will be based on a simpler new discovery, and a proper solution will be obtained, that is, the currently popular cathode-ray tube may also be abandoned.</p>
<p>No matter how much television will progress, it is quite possible that future television will be transmitted by shortwave radio. According to the opinions of television experts, current television sets require a 400 kHz wide band (music only requires 10 kHz) to display an image as clear as a photographic copperplate in an ordinary book. Therefore, the narrow bandwidth broadcasting band and shortwave band cannot accommodate television stations that need to occupy 400 kHz, and they have to be placed in the wide bandwidth ultra-shortwave range. However, ultra-shortwaves cannot reach far, so dozens of relay stations have to be used for retransmission; then the equipment costs of these dozens of relay stations and the special cables used for connecting the relay stations are enough to make the current television broadcast only reach a corner, and the business is difficult to prosper. Therefore, if future television can find a way to broadcast with a narrower band, then one or two powerful radio stations with a wavelength of about 20 meters will be used to avoid the need for many relay stations.</p>
<p>Ideal shadow, but also has sound, in order to like a sound film "sound and color" purchase in this problem is nothing more than the following three ways to solve it:</p>
<p>A Film and sound are broadcast together for a long time.</p>
<p>B The film uses the ultra-shortwave band, and the sound uses the broadcast band.</p>
<p>C Relatively optimal, and sound in the ultra-shortwave band, while using the same wavelength broadcast (this method has been tried successfully), then the receiver can match the same wavelength, while receiving the shadow and sound.</p>
<h3>The Most Common Defects of Superheterodyne and TRF Radios and Their Prevention Methods</h3>
<p>— Silian</p>
<p>Superheterodyne or T.R.F. (i.e., tuning radio frequency amplification) and other radios, in order to seek loud sound, the audio frequency amplification after the detection stage or the second detection stage must be performed by a pentode power tube (PoweiPentodetube), such as 2A5, 42, 41, 4347 and other vacuum tubes. This type of vacuum tube can withstand extremely high screen pressure, and its output is also extremely large. For example, the screen current output of 2A5, 42 and other vacuum tubes is 34 milliamps, so there must be a way to protect their speakers. In ordinary radios, it is often composed of an audio frequency choke and a fixed capacitor, but in superheterodyne or tuning radio frequency amplification or other devices using pentode power tubes, an output transformer is used. This type of output transformer is usually connected to an electric speaker.</p>
<p>The primary coil of the output voltage regulator is usually wound with 40 to 44 gauge British enameled wire, or 36 to 40 gauge American enameled wire, so it is easily burned out. If it is damp and moldy, the screen grid will easily turn red, and the music sound emitted by the electric speaker will be as thin as a mosquito's buzz, or there will be no sound at all, or even noise. After the vacuum tube suffers this huge injury, it will reduce its inherent characteristics, that is, the results after repair will always be inferior to the original clarity and loudness. This kind of defect is often encountered, so it has to be prevented. The method is to replace the primary coil with thicker enameled wire. Also, if the C resistor is damaged, this kind of defect is also likely to occur, because the control grid lacks its corresponding load. This prevention method can be to replace the C resistor with a larger watt, or not to use a C resistor and directly connect the cathode to the ground wire. If the pole soil has no corresponding load and the results are not good, the grid resistor can be changed to a megohm to two megohms.</p>
<h3>Global Radio Statistics</h3>
<p>— Jie Ru</p>
<p>The yearbook recently published by the International Radio Broadcasting Bureau shows the progress of broadcasting in various countries.</p>
<p>This yearbook tells us that at the end of 1934, the total number of radios in the world was approximately 48,300,000, which means that there were at least 193,000,000 listeners.</p>
<p>Of these 48,300,000 radios, 23,000,000 belonged to Europe, mostly with usage licenses. The United States had the largest part of this total, approximately 20,075,000, followed by the United Kingdom with approximately 6,780,560 and Germany with approximately 6,142,921. Calculated by the proportion of national population, Denmark had the most radios in the world, with an average of 160 radios per 1,000 residents.</p>
<p>In 1934, the total number of radios in use worldwide was approximately 3,500,000, excluding the 2 million radios in cars in the United States. This naturally increased the number of listeners by at least 13 million.</p>

<h3>The Intellectual World of China Today</h3>
<p>— Murofushi Takanobu</p>
<p>Japanese commentator Murofushi Takanobu recently traveled to various parts of China, both north and south, under the arrangement of Mainichi Shimbun. During his stay in Shanghai, he became known to the Chinese people for publishing his opinions on the "New Life" incident and the Sino-Japanese issue. After returning to Japan, he wrote "Travels in China" based on his travels, which were published daily in the Yomiuri Shimbun. This article is one of them. Reading it can give a glimpse of his observations on the intellectual world of China. Translator's note.</p>
<p>One: Hu Shih Does Not Know the Philosophy of Life Today</p>
<p>On the morning of the 17th, in order to exchange views with Chinese thinkers, I visited Mr. Hu Shih. Since the literary revolution, the name of Hu Shih, or Mr. Hu Shih, has been known throughout the world.</p>
<p>Most Japanese intellectuals probably know his name. His famous book "Outline of the History of Chinese Philosophy" has also been translated into Japanese. It has been nearly 20 years since he advocated the literary revolution, that is, vernacular literature. During this period, he has always stood on the front line of the Chinese intellectual world. Among Chinese youths, his reputation is not as good as it used to be, but he is still a first-class thinker and a leader in one field. The point of his fame is that he is the foremost in China.</p>
<p>Hu Shih is currently the Dean of the College of Arts at Peking University, and also edits a weekly magazine called "Independent Review." It has a circulation of 7,500 copies, which cannot be compared with the 60,000 to 70,000 copies of Shanghai's "Eastern Magazine," but it is still worthy of being the most powerful commentary magazine guiding one side of the Chinese journalistic world. If we do not mention Hu Shih, it is impossible to talk about China's academic, intellectual, commentary circles, as well as today's China and its people.</p>
<p>Hu Shih's home is near Peking University, at the bottom of the back door of Beiping. As soon as the car stopped in front of the door, a doorman came out to stop the dog he was raising. The courtyard inside the door is several feet wide, and the house has its own car. The house is a very grand Western-style building, which is top-notch for a scholar's life, but a little extravagant. As for me, if I were a scholar, I would have enough with eight or nine thatched huts and a life like Tao Yuanming.</p>
<p>After entering the door, Mr. Hu Shih, who came out from inside, led me into the guest room himself. He looked like a pale-faced scholar, of medium stature. I didn't think this was the world-renowned thinker Mr. Hu Shih.</p>
<p>"Mr. Murofushi," Hu Shih read, asking me for the Japanese pronunciation of this surname, and then said, "I have read Mr. Murofushi's books, but because I don't understand Japanese, I can't fully understand them."</p>
<p>"Sir, your name is very famous in Japan. Chiang Kai-shek, Mei Lanfang, and Hu Shih are all known to everyone in Japan."</p>
<p>I said politely, and he then asked: "Does Mr. still hold the ideas of Orientalism now?"</p>
<p>"Yes," I replied. "There is also a group of reactionary thinkers called Orientalists in Japan, but it is wrong to regard my position as the same as theirs. My Orientalism starts from the end of modern Western Europeanism and points to the future world."</p>
<p>"Yes," Hu Shih's expression seemed to understand and not understand. I continued to explain my position: "I belong to the category of liberalism."</p>
<p>"Are you not just reflecting the merchant philosophy of the capitalist era in philosophy, pragmatism, and politics, democracy?" I then asked boldly.</p>
<p>"I don't think so."</p>
<p>"I believe that so-called democracy and dictatorship are by no means absolute, immovable, or permanent truths or formulas. They are things that depend on the stage of social development and are determined by the stage of social development."</p>
<p>"My embrace of liberalism is not because I think everything is good, but generally it is British and American." This was Hu Shih's answer. At this point, it was impossible to reconcile.</p>
<p>"What about the Kuomintang?"</p>
<p>"The Kuomintang is not necessarily a dictatorship, and Chiang Kai-shek is certainly not a so-called dictator." His answer seemed to agree with the Kuomintang, and yet it didn't seem to agree. In short, he was against dictatorship within the Kuomintang.</p>
<p>From another room, he took a bound copy of "Independent Review" and a booklet he had written himself and gave them to me. He said that after reading these, I would know that China is different from Germany and Italy, and there is no need for dictatorial politics.</p>
<p>Later, I asked what the mainstream of the Chinese intellectual world was. He replied:</p>
<p>"Intellectual anarchy."</p>
<p>Perhaps that is so. Japan is the same. But in this state of intellectual anarchy, there is also its own direction.</p>
<p>We then went on to discuss the relationship between pragmatism and Bergson's philosophy, Dewey's position, Nietzsche's revival, humanism, and later on Liang Qichao. We expressed our opinions on Liang Qichao's position and the most prominent "Chinese-based culture" in today's Chinese intellectual world.</p>
<p>In short, Mr. Hu Shih, who was influenced by the pragmatist American philosophy, has completely not paid attention to the ideas of life that are shining in the world today.</p>
<p>Finally, he said: "Chen Lifu advocates vitalism, but in the end it is nothing but nihilism." This is the view of the foremost great thinker in China on the philosophy of life in the surging world.</p>
<p>"Do the ideas of Heidegger, Jaspers, etc. have any influence in China? But in Japan, this is the mainstream of thought," I asked. He said: "There is no influence whatsoever in China."</p>
<p>There is no influence in China, and there is no influence on Mr. Hu Shih, these are two different things, but the foremost great thinker in China has not paid attention to it, or at least has not thought about it enough.</p>
<p>(Translator's note: Martin Heidegger and Karl Jaspers are both contemporary German philosophers of life after Wilhelm Dilthey)</p>
<p>Two: The Scholarly Style of Empirical Research</p>
<p>On the evening of the 17th, I attended a banquet hosted by Mr. Tao Xisheng. Speaking of Tao Xisheng, perhaps few people in Japan know him. He is the editor of the semi-monthly magazine "Food and Goods," a professor at Peking University, and has written many books. Whether as a writer or a critic, he belongs to the first-class figures in that country. I knew his name five or six years ago. He is a new thinker, and I have read several volumes of his works.</p>
<p>Mr. Tao has also read a dozen volumes of my books, and seems to be able to understand my position. He sent me the bound volume of "Food and Goods" which he edited, with the words "To the Great Social Critic Mr. Murofushi Takanobu" written on the cover. I am truly overwhelmed with trepidation.</p>
<p>The venue was the best restaurant in Beiping. Because I was late for the agreed time, Mr. Tao had already been waiting there. Mr. Zhou Binglin, Dean of the Law School of Peking University, was also there, as was Mr. Guan Yixian, the president of "Shibao." Later came Mr. Zhang Yingnan, Professor of Administrative Law at Peking University, and Mr. Dai Xiuzan, Professor of Law. Mr. Li Da of Beiping University, is a sharp economic critic in modern China, but did not come, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>With a face of modesty, although he could not be compared with the late Mr. Tian Xingcun, he also had a bit of the appearance of a scholar. Unlike the talented type like Hu Shih, from his appearance, one could immediately tell that he was a sincere scholar.</p>
<p>We first talked about the recent intellectual world in China, and the thinking atmosphere among the youth. We also talked about communism, which once dominated the minds of Chinese intellectuals. "That was in 1924 to 1927," Mr. Tao said. "In 1927 to 1931, although it still retained its embers, it has recently been completely extinguished." Now, "Das Kapital" is no longer published. Moreover, among students, there is no trace of such a tendency."</p>
<p>"It is said that Beiping is a center of anti-Japanese movements..."</p>
<p>"That is due to internal political issues," Mr. Dai replied. Mr. Dai studied in Japan, so he understands Japanese.</p>
<p>"So-called internal political issues..."</p>
<p>"Then it is the same thing as the German National Socialist Party abolishing the Treaty of Versailles. But what about the students' recent xenophobic fervor?"</p>
<p>"Recently, students have been burying themselves in their studies."</p>
<p>"What are your thoughts on the recent North China Incident?"</p>
<p>"Nothing much, because we have had even more painful experiences."</p>
<p>This was Mr. Dai's reply. What are the "more painful experiences"? This sentence contains deep meaning. Although this sentence is not explained, it is understood throughout China. Even Japanese people, if they can understand and sympathize with the painful position of their neighbors, I think they will all understand.</p>
<p>Here, whether the most fundamental problem is resolved or not, people will never forget to take this into account. A great nation should be tolerant of foreign countries. Therefore, one's own self-reflection should be the most serious. We Japanese have been taught with such morality since our ancestors.</p>
<p>Among us, the Sino-Japanese issue naturally became the center of the topic. Because of the lack of freedom of speech, there are many obstacles, but understanding between us is easy, and in matters of understanding and agreement, everything is often resolved with very few words. Malice and conspiracy are the biggest causes of international relations falling into disputes, and only goodwill is the most effective way to resolve such disputes. What I want to say here is that the wise men of Japan and China should quickly unite.</p>
<p>That the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan handles Sino-Japanese relations, that is, diplomacy, seems to be their unanimous hope. Since the Ministry of Foreign Affairs exists, among the Japanese people, there is probably no one who does not hope for this.</p>
<p>The scope of our conversation ranged widely, from Lao Zhuang, the Book of Changes, the relationship between Lao Tzu and Confucius, the revival of Taoism and Confucianism. I cannot describe these here. From what I have seen, among the new Chinese thinkers, there does not yet seem to be a sufficient re-evaluation of the old Chinese learning, but no matter how new a thinker is, they are now deeply concerned about this point. At least, empirical research on the events of ancient Chinese society, and therefore on Chinese history, has become the center of academia and taste, and this is an unshakable fact.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Common Publishing Law (Continued) (End)</h3>
<p>— Zheng Zongkai</p>
<p>3.  Distribution</p>
<p>The sale and distribution of Japanese documents and pictures are limited to merchants who are in the business of selling documents and pictures, except for authors and their heirs. Normally, distribution can begin three days after the publishing report is submitted. According to Order B No. 55 of the Ministry of Home Affairs in October of Meiji 15 (1882), the publication of portraits of shrines and temples is prohibited except by the shrines and temples themselves.</p>
<p>4.  Restrictions on Form and Content</p>
<p>According to the Japanese "Publishing Law," publishers and printers of documents and pictures must include their names, addresses, and dates at the end of their documents and pictures, but the author's name is not mandatory.</p>
<p>Regarding the content of Japanese publications, prohibited matters, according to the "Publishing Law" and the "Juvenile Law," are listed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Matters that defend crimes or offenders, or protect or reward those in criminal trials.</p>
<p>(2) Matters concerning preliminary examinations and litigation matters where hearings are prohibited, before public trial.</p>
<p>(3) Matters concerning confidential documents of diplomacy, military affairs, and other government offices, and records of government office deliberations and conference matters where hearings are prohibited, without the permission of the relevant government office.</p>
<p>(4) Matters that disrupt public order and harm public morals.</p>
<p>(5) Matters concerning military secrets, and documents and pictures without permission.</p>
<p>(6) Matters that undermine the political system and disrupt the national constitution.</p>
<p>(7) Matters concerning trials in juvenile courts and, for criminal cases involving juveniles, matters concerning their preliminary examinations and public trials.</p>
<p>5.  Administrative Dispositions</p>
<p>In Japan, administrative dispositions regarding publications, according to the "Publishing Law," are of four types, which are explained separately as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Prohibition of sale and distribution and confiscation of engraved plates and prints. The prohibition of sale and distribution of publications is claimed by the Japanese as a unique system in their country, with few examples in other countries.</p>
<p>If a publication is deemed to disrupt public order or disturb public morals, the Minister of Home Affairs may prohibit its sale and distribution and may also confiscate its printing plates and prints. However, according to Article 19 of the "Publishing Law," this confiscation is limited to publications owned by the publisher or those whose business is sale and distribution; if it is already owned by an individual, it naturally cannot be confiscated.</p>
<p>(2) Prohibition and Confiscation of Foreign Publications. If the Japanese Minister of Home Affairs believes that publications issued in foreign countries and territories such as Korea, Taiwan, and the Kwantung Leased Territory, where the "Publishing Law" is not enforced, are detrimental to domestic public order or disrupt public morals, he may prohibit their sale and distribution within the areas where the "Publishing Law" is enforced. ( )</p>
<p>(3) Suspension of Magazine Publication. According to the Japanese "Publishing Law," if a magazine violates the matters it is restricted from publishing, the Minister of Home Affairs may order it to cease publication. Publications that have been subjected to a suspension of publication may not be republished under the "Publishing Law" until one year has passed.</p>
<p>(4) Provisional Confiscation by Prosecutors. If a Japanese prosecutor finds that the content of a publication contains prohibited matters, he may temporarily confiscate its printing plates and prints. In such cases, the parts to be confiscated and the parts not to be confiscated can be distinguished and separately divided and confiscated from the body of the printed matter.</p>
<p>6.  Publishing Offenses</p>
<p>In a broad sense, a publishing offense refers to a person who violates all publishing laws and is punished. As used in this article, a publishing offense is limited to violations of the "Publishing Law." Publishing offenses can be divided into publishing criminal offenses and publishing police offenses. Publishing criminal offenses are those where the content of the publication is the basis for punishment, while publishing police offenses are those where the form of the publication is the basis for punishment.</p>
<p>According to the Japanese "Publishing Law," a publishing offense does not necessarily require the sale and distribution of documents and pictures; even without sale and distribution, if the purpose is sale and distribution, or if there is printing activity, the qualification for a publishing offense can be established.</p>
<p>In Japan, the provisions of the "Criminal Law" regarding voluntary surrender, increased punishment for repeat offenses, and combined offenses do not apply to publishing offenses. The statute of limitations for prosecution is one year.</p>
<p>(Note) The Japanese "Publishing Law" does not apply to Korea, Taiwan, and the Kwantung Leased Territory. These regions each have their own separate regulations: Korea has the "Korean Publishing Regulations" of the Korean Resident-General Ordinance No. 20 of Meiji 43 (1910), Taiwan has the "Taiwan Publishing Regulations" of the Taiwan Governor-General Ordinance No. 19 of Meiji 33 (1900), and the Kwantung Leased Territory has the "Kwantung Leased Territory Common Publication Handling Regulations" of the Kwantung Government Office Ordinance No. 30 of Taisho 14 (1925).</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>The Global Trend of Restoration</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Strangely enough, the recent global trend of restoration has surged so powerfully. One moment Greece is shouting for restoration, the next Austria is also clamoring for it, as if restoration has become a fashionable political movement. It exhausts a group of deposed emperors, princes, and aristocratic royalists, who are extremely busy preparing to come out and take action to restore their former lost empires. Although these two European restoration movements have currently subsided because the time is not yet ripe, their restorationists are already celebrating each other in anticipation, waiting for the arrival of an unexpected opportunity to fulfill their long-cherished ambitions.</p>
<p>Naturally, as long as they are not idiots, emperors and nobles would want to enjoy their lifestyle. Many Luzon people stranded on the Huangpu River in Shanghai, although now living a pitiful life of begging in a foreign land, cannot help but want to immediately overthrow the Soviet government when they think of their past glory and wealth. The White Russian restoration movement may also be launched in the future.</p>
<p>Look, today a Turkish prince, because his great ambition for restoration failed, committed suicide in indignation. A Reuters New York dispatch reported: A young man committed suicide in a hotel here, and it is now known to be Klin, the grandson of the former Turkish Emperor Hamid, aged thirty. According to a letter left to the police chief here, the reason for the suicide was his infatuation with a wealthy American woman who owned a huge inheritance. He had planned to marry her so that he could use her wealth to recruit and train an army to return to his country and carry out a restoration. However, good things are often difficult, and the marriage did not materialize. In despair, he took this drastic measure.</p>
<p>The recent prevalence of the global trend of restoration is indeed a good ornament to the turbulent situation. Generally, the occurrence of restoration movements is due to the machinations of a group of evildoers. But if there is no environment to create restoration, the evildoers will have no way to act. For example, the current restoration in Austria is promoted by the power struggle between Italy and Germany.</p>
<h3>Lament on Lake Tai</h3>
<p>— Li Ang</p>
<p>Lake Tai, always so tranquil, like a gentle face, even when there is a windy day, the rolling green waves, following the wind, gradually pass by, without containing any danger. The continuous mountain ridges, the near ones are emerald green, the far ones are light purple, and the places where stones have been excavated appear tiger yellow, like jade inlaid with coral. The sky, like a piece of azure velvet, sets off the scene with extraordinary clarity.</p>
<p>Tranquil and clear Lake Tai, immersed in such radiant and beautiful gemstones: emerald green and light purple...</p>
<p>Another gemstone rolled up from the lake water—</p>
<p>In the morning, the reeds, covered in water dew, were whispering in the wind, the sparrows were chattering noisily on the willow branches of the stone embankment, and the eastern sky was undergoing an extraordinary transformation. When those long strips, long strips of rainbow, resembling the color of accumulated blood, spread out, an early sun, like a round, transparent amber ball, gradually, gradually, rose above the horizon. Then, every blade of grass, every leaf, every flower... on the earth was splashed with the brilliance of life, and the ducks also flocked to the beach to find food.</p>
<p>On such a morning, treading on the water dew on the grass, I prepared to go to the stone pond to see an old relative who was ill. By nature, I was afraid of seeing the twilight, afraid of seeing an elderly person who was dying. However, having received the instructions of my elders, I could not escape and had to go early once. At this time, the small steamer had not yet arrived, and I hired a ferry at Baojie Bridge.</p>
<p>I sat obliquely on the bow of the boat, and the woman rowing the oar at the stern was about thirty years old. The boat slowly parted the short reeds and rippled towards the lake surface. The amber sunlight shone on my face and also shone on her face. I was melancholy, thinking of an elderly person who was dying, but she also looked so melancholy, what was she thinking of? Yes, I remembered what she had said to me just now:</p>
<p>"Sir: Are you going to the stone pond? It's sixty cents for a round trip."</p>
<p>Her voice was trembling and hoarse, like the sound of a loose bowstring, with a hint of lament. I began to suspect that she had quarreled with her husband, or had been abused by her parents-in-law for no reason? Because, in rural families, this is very common, the more difficult life is, the easier it is for a daughter-in-law to be wronged... I kept thinking like this, watching the retreating gray and white long bridge. The woman at the stern sighed as she looked at me. The oar in her hand seemed about to be put down, but I didn't want to say a word to her, "What unpleasant things do you have, can't you row faster?" These words reached my throat and then slipped back into my stomach.</p>
<p>Why, on this lake surface in the brilliance of life, was there a boat full of dark melancholy!</p>
<p>"Rower, is this the only boat your family has?" I finally started talking to her.</p>
<p>"There is only one, I don't row when my man is here." Her eyes were red, the sunlight turned white, scorching hot on my neck, scorching on her withered yellow hair.</p>
<p>"Then how did he die?"</p>
<p>"He died of illness, he had typhoid fever the month before last!"</p>
<p>"How old was he?"</p>
<p>"Only twenty-five, alas... he didn't even celebrate his birthday."</p>
<p>"Aren't you yourself about thirty years old!" I was surprised by their mismatched ages.</p>
<p>"Oh, no, it's just that I've been worn down like this, sir: The whole burden is on my shoulders, a two-year-old child at home, a paralyzed grandfather, and the grandmother is also like the setting sun!"... Saying this, she suddenly stopped, and her haggard face turned to face the emerald green mountain ridges. She seemed to regret that she shouldn't have talked about her family affairs in front of an unrelated person. She rowed the oar a little faster. I dared not mention anything to her again.</p>
<p>The boat, facing the morning breeze, rippled forward, the rolling green waves of the lake, were so tranquil and yet so gentle, I held back my sigh, letting the reeds frequently shake their heads at me, and the fishing nets frequently shed tears for me.</p>
<h3>Three Pagodas of Dali</h3>
<p>— Dan Er</p>
<p>Dali, nestled in the embrace of the secluded and expansive Cangshan Mountains and the gentle and light Erhai Lake, possesses uniquely outstanding scenery in all seasons:</p>
<p>"Wind, flowers, snow, moon."</p>
<p>The whole of Dali is intoxicated, like an ethereal and exquisite beauty, swaying in dance, making the people under Cangshan feel almost like they are about to ascend into the heavens. But on hot summer nights, Dali is uniquely the best season. The scenery and atmosphere of summer nights often make tourists feel as if they are in a dream.</p>
<p>The evening breeze rises, and the trees on Cangshan play a more rustling and leisurely melody. The Erhai Lake, with its mirror-like blue waves, ripples and undulates. People already feel as light as if they were in the cool ninth month of autumn, exceptionally refreshing. Strolling near the foot of Cangshan and climbing Cangshan, bursts of clear, serene, and fragrant air permeate the heart and spleen, making one feel comfortable even in the bones, floating and looking at the secluded, winding, and fascinating mountains and clouds, like a person from another world. Stopping under the dense shade, the cool breeze gently brushes the sleeves, clear, ethereal, and moistening, making one feel as if they have suddenly grown several times taller. The tranquility is so intoxicating that one feels lost and without a master, body and mind merged into nature, no longer</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>in the human world. I love to linger and hesitate, the beauty of the mountains is deep, the sky is clear and pure white, the body and mind are light, heaven and earth, a seamless whole. It is often said that the wind disappears in the sleeves, I think only at this time can one have that kind of realm to speak of.</p>
<p>The summit of Cangshan is covered with snow all year round, but the climate is like spring in all seasons. The white snow is like white snow, shrouding the mountains, extraordinarily beautiful, making people gaze endlessly. The strong may even bravely climb the mountains to play in the snow, their laughter loud and clear, often heard from the secluded valleys, faintly distinguishable, extremely tempting, feeling both illusory and delicate, seeming near and far. If you raise your eyes while holding a tree and look down at Cangshan, it is like a quiet and indistinct painting, a night scene of unparalleled beauty, making it impossible to tell where is the most wonderful or the most beautiful.</p>
<p>Slowly stopping the trembling soul, carefully examining. From the quiet, misty, and lush area, a huge pen rack emerges faintly, like a celestial being slowly descending from the sky. Even in the night, under the clear and pure white air, it is simple, pure white, and steadfastly gazing. That kind of towering and majestic spirit shakes the heart. This is the most magnificent Three Pagodas of Dali. Then, continuing south, vaguely and distantly, another giant pen suddenly stands erect, seemingly connected to the sky. Looking back at the Three Pagodas, they look like a giant and beautiful pen rack, firmly holding a pen beside them. Amidst the ceaseless amazement, one will also find the uniquely elegant Jade Wave Pool in front of the Three Pagodas, near the seaside, its lush green water seems to be overflowing. At this time, one will suddenly feel as if in another world, as if oneself is an artist, with a stunning landscape painting spread out in front, the Three Pagodas are a pen rack, the other spire is a paintbrush, and the Jade Wave Pool is an ink pot. Scenery, people, pagodas, and paintings are all merged into one. Gazing in awe:</p>
<p>"What an exquisite picture!"</p>
<p>How the magnificent Three Pagodas were created, no one knows, and how big and how tall they are, there is no way to understand. To look up at the spire under the pagoda, one must raise one's head so high that the hat falls off and still not see clearly. It is best to lie down on the ground and look up at the sky. The pagoda body is about eighteen stories high, and each story is very tall. The size of the pagoda body requires one hundred and twenty-four people to reach out and surround it, which shows its enormous scale. Each story spirals upwards, and the strongest person can only climb to the sixth story before being unable to withstand the strong wind. Therefore, from this point, one can also guess the pagoda's extraordinary height. At the very top of the spire are five giant iron gourds, the ones above getting smaller, and one year a hurricane blew down the last one. Seen from the ground, it was so tiny that it could not be seen, but when it appeared on the ground, it was a huge iron object that several people could not drag, several feet high, larger than a square table. Below the gourd is a cluster of iron trees, and a small branch once fell off, but when it landed on the ground, it was larger than a coffin. Further down are several golden chickens, and once a piece of a golden chicken foot collapsed, as big as a huge gourd. This made the people of Dali see it as a mysterious and magnificent pagoda. The magnificent and enormous scale of the construction shows that China had astonishing achievements in ancient times, but this is rarely known to people.</p>
<p>Looking at this exquisite picture, and thinking of the magnificence of the giant pagoda forgotten by the people of the country, one is filled with amazement that seems both tragic and poignant. Looking around again, the mountains, the pagodas, and the people seem to tremble, almost making me fall off the mountain. Ah! What admirable "scenery"!</p>
<h3>Commercialized Schools!</h3>
<h3>Kidnapped (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Lin Hao</p>
<p>"Softer, softer! There are bandits!" The old master lowered his hoarse voice to almost nothing! As if he had a huge burden on his shoulders.</p>
<p>Everyone was quietly silent, only the sound of heavy breathing could be heard.</p>
<p>"Bang, bang, bang" there was another burst of urgent gunfire, and the old master was clearly alarmed, his face revealing infinite sorrow.</p>
<p>Gently, we stepped out of the gate, one step at a time.</p>
<p>A large group of black shadows came into view: The old master said in a trembling voice, "Who is it?"</p>
<p>As they approached, we realized that it was the local militia: "Where are the bandits?"</p>
<p>"Over there:" The old master pointed to the distant clumps of trees. (Behind the trees was a large pile of black mountains.)</p>
<p>The militia first turned their gaze over there and stared for a few moments, then took down the flintlocks on their backs and crept forward, step by step.</p>
<p>It was as solemn as if it would always be silent here.</p>
<p>After a while, the gunfire over there became even more urgent, and it was clear that they were engaged in a firefight. Everyone held a special hope, praying.</p>
<p>The night was spent in a terrifying situation.</p>
<p>The next day, large groups of people gathered in the inn, talking about the events of last night: "Hey, those bandits were really fierce! When they couldn't kidnap the child, they shot and knocked down Jin Sangui. Then they carried the child away, but they were surrounded by the militiamen! They then went at it with 'bang, bang, bang.' Hmph, the result is something that no one would believe!..."</p>
<p>"How so?"</p>
<p>"The child was finally kidnapped!" Disappointed large eyes.</p>
<p>I had no mood to bother with this idle account; I jumped onto the mule cart: The coachman cracked the whip loudly on the mule's back, and the cart gradually turned towards the road bathed in the faint morning light.</p>
<h3>Dawn</h3>
<p>— Hua Mu</p>
<p>Before dawn, the mind and spirit return to a state of tranquility and clarity. I remember in my childhood, I followed this belief, and when the eastern sky broke light, I would squat on the steps of the sky and read aloud the books that the teacher taught me, the diligent and earnest situation, now when I think of it, it seems like it is before my eyes. However, this kind of realm is only something that children in the countryside can enjoy, like in Shanghai, habits and environment have pushed the morning back to eight or nine o'clock.</p>
<p>I can't help but thank this ordinary living environment, which has allowed me to break away from the urban residence of Shanghai and go to this semi-rural town of Jiangwan, and allowed me to see again before dawn my tranquil heart and clear unified spirit. Although the increase in age has no longer retained that narrow realm of childhood, but because of the experience of life, I have seen here the beautiful and ugly realities of various states.</p>
<p>After a moderate sleep, I gently woke up from my dream again. Half a blanket covered my peaceful limbs. The world at this time is enough to plunge one into the sea of thought. Outside the window, the sky is quietly hazy, the sparse stars are sleepy: Outside the fence, the dark shadow of a sycamore tree is dotted there. The sound of frogs, crickets, and the long chirping of earthworms come from the fields in the distance, showing the peace and tranquility of the earth. The eastern sky is gradually turning white. The short and powerful crowing of a rooster seems to have lost the distant charm of the loud crowing at noon, this small animal, perhaps to welcome the coming of light, its pulse is excited.</p>
<p>The sirens of the factories in Zhabei have gradually begun to sound loudly, this heavy signal, from far to near, breaks through the tranquil air, and seems to vibrate the sleeping bed. How many people, carrying sweat and fatigue, are spit out from that iron gate, and how many people, with anemic hands and faces, begin to be swallowed in from the iron gate. These kinds of associations stimulate my brain and gradually make me uneasy. At this time, the sharp cries of crows respond to the factory sirens, the atmosphere becomes even more solemn and tense, this mixed sound wave covers up the clear and wonderful wing strings of the crickets outside the fence, and the chanting of the earthworms. The nerves have been besieged in an atmosphere of bewilderment and sorrow. This animal also realizes that the iron shackles of life are about to be placed on people's backs again. For the sake of life, humans and animals must both suffer.</p>
<p>Another burst of rooster crowing. Earth-shattering trucks, madly speeding past the road outside the fence. Dogs bark, greeting the vegetable vendors driving to the market. Listening to these cries of sorrow squeezed out for life, one cannot help but think of the vegetable growers in their hometown, year after year, they also carry vegetables from before dawn to the city market, exchanging them for a day's worth of rice that is barely enough to fill their stomachs; they also have to bear countless miscellaneous donations and taxes. Life has pressed them so much that they can't even squeeze out a sigh when hurrying on the road.</p>
<p>The noise of the city streets is stirring up, how many treacherous merchants are again beginning to swindle and contend with those honest villagers. Between people there is always a cruel divide! The wing strings of the crickets are cut off sometime, and a few stars have also fallen asleep. The butcherbirds in the garden have already begun to sing loudly their sinister laughter, singing with abandon; alarming the sleeping sparrows, chirping and jumping on the telephone wires, innocently saying good morning to this newly awakened earth. The handcarts squeak and groan. Afterwards, the first train on the Songhu line also raises its childish voice and slides away at full speed. The fog over the fields gradually dissipates. In the sound of the early cicadas, draped in a morning gown, leaning on the window railing, watching the bright red sunrise, slowly spitting out fierce golden arrows, shooting towards my face. Suddenly, I feel a surge of inner encouragement!</p>
<p>The earth has completely awakened. Light repeats its illumination across the human world. Humanity must again shed sweat and blood for the sake of light!</p>

<h3>National Studies</h3>
<p>Feng Mingquan's "Guan Zhi of Ancient Prose"</p>
<p>Ming Yuan (960) 7:30 AM to 8:30 AM</p>
<p>"Preface to Liu Xiang's 'Strategies of the Warring States'" (6)</p>
<p>However, the state of Qin had the advantage of geography and profit. The strategists all rushed to it first. Su Qin initially wanted to ally with Qin, but Qin did not employ him, so he allied with the eastern states. After Su Qin's death, Zhang Yi united the states horizontally, and the feudal lords listened to him and served Qin to the west. Therefore, the First Emperor, relying on a country surrounded by strongholds, and the obstructions of Hangu Pass, and the benefits of Long and Shu, listened to the strategies of many people, and taking advantage of the legacy of the Second Emperor, he nibbled away at the six states, annexed the feudal lords, and possessed the empire. He relied on the accumulation of deceitful schemes, and ultimately lacked the sincerity of trustworthiness, and lacked the teachings of morality, and the transformation of benevolence and righteousness, to bind the hearts of the empire. He relied on criminal law as governance, and trusted small tricks as the way, so he burned books and buried scholars alive. He looked down on Yao and Shun, and disdained the Three Kings. The Second Emperor was even worse, with no grace descending, no feelings reaching, the ruler and his ministers suspecting each other, and blood relatives becoming estranged. The transformation of morality was shallow and weak, the norms of governance were destroyed, and the people did not see righteousness and hung on to unrest. He ruled the empire for fourteen years, and the empire collapsed greatly. This was the evil of deceit and falsehood. How far it was from the virtue of a king!</p>

<p>New Chapter in the Literacy Movement</p>
<p>Like a sea of illiteracy, laugh at neighboring countries. Sighing that China lacks improvement. Cities are like this, and the countryside is even worse. How can we wipe out shame and hope for a strong nation? Most to be pitied. Not understanding the meaning of words leads to ignorance. Truly like. A blind horse facing a pond, stumbling everywhere. Therefore, we must. Persuade with good words in a thousand ways. Therefore, we must. Investigate door to door with special details. Regardless of that. Wind-blown, rain-soaked, hardworking laborers. Regardless of that. Mothers who give birth to sons and daughters. Regardless of that. Wet nurses, cooks, and stewards in wealthy families. They must also. Find leisure time to pick up a book. For example, listening to the song "Fisherman's Light." For example, often listening to "Ten Sending Langs." For example, making friends to play mahjong. For example, going to the dance hall every day. Hoping everyone. Strive forward and do not be lazy. Do not let. Good times slip away. Know that. From ancient times, it is said that it is difficult first and easy later. Hoping everyone. Exert energy and attend classes. One day when success is complete. Part the clouds and see the light of day. Then you will know that the taste of reading is unique.</p>

<h3>Broadcasting News</h3>
<p>The Yellow River has flooded, and the Yangtze River has also burst its banks. Unprecedented disasters have created unprecedented tragedies. Fields have been submerged, houses have been destroyed, and the unfortunate victims are floating in the turbid currents, battered by the huge waves. Even those who are lucky enough to escape are left without clothing, food, or shelter, enduring the bitterness of displacement and ultimately succumbing to starvation and disease, leading to death. Mr. Lin Huayan, director of the China Children's Story Broadcasting Society and Yongsheng Radio Station, in light of this, has requested Mr. Xu Shaochang to write a story based on the facts, which will be told this week (August 11th) from 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM on Yongsheng Radio Station (frequency 1080). It is said that to make the story more realistic, sound effects will be added, such as the sound of violent winds and rain, thunder and lightning, floods, cries for help, the sound of gongs warning of danger, the sound of houses collapsing, etc., to arouse great sympathy among listeners and make them aware of the need for disaster relief.</p>
<p>Movie News</p>
<h3>Yueming Intelligence</h3>
<p>Since the release of "Confusion," until the end of July, Yuehua received 97 letters from movie fans addressed to Lang Lizhu on Yuehua's behalf, and Yue Ming received a total of 278 letters, mostly from South China. Many letters were also sent from girls' schools in the Ximen area of this city.</p>
<p>Yueming Sound Photography Studio has been rebuilt and doubled in size from its original area.</p>
<p>Ding Ding has left Shanghai. The script written specifically for Little Wu Lizhu will be rushed after he returns to Shanghai next week.</p>
<p>Kuang Zan, the inventor of the Chinese Telegraph Code, is currently dubbing the Tibetan film for Yueming, and is also recording sound for Mr. Wang of the New Era Company.</p>
<p>After Jinshan and Zhao Dan, Zheng Junli, and others successfully performed "Nora," they will rehearse another play, still directed by Wan .</p>
<p>Zheng Yisheng will use his eight months of experience in Tibet to write a realistic script similar to a North Pole expedition.</p>
<p>The Tibetan film will be dubbed in the future. A unique musician in Yueming is working hard to prepare a strange and unique piece of music with resemblances to the music of Tarzan, but with a different style.</p>
<h3>Don't Let It Down</h3>
<p>— Little Angel</p>
<p>The lack of universal Chinese children's education and the severe deficiency in Chinese children's education represent a tremendous loss for China and all its children. Indeed, children's education is the foundation of the nation's education, and its importance cannot be overstated.</p>
<p>Given the hardships and difficulties in China today, the future responsibilities of children are particularly significant. To enable these children to shoulder these arduous and significant future burdens, it is imperative to actively cultivate and nurture them, fostering a resilient strength within them. We believe that the primary factor in developing this strength is undoubtedly the provision of a positive environment.</p>
<p>Tragically, a considerable number of Chinese children are being harmed by fundamentally irrational living conditions. If we were to witness the film "Little Angel," we would undoubtedly experience a profoundly stimulating effect.</p>
<p>Indeed, the environment of children is certainly not created by the children themselves. However, who should be responsible for changing their environment?</p>
<p>We believe that the screening of "Little Angel" will cause countless parents to shed tears of shame, while simultaneously saving the souls of numerous children.</p>
<p>The appearance of "Little Angel," a film drama imbued with the essence of children's education, on the Chinese film scene today represents an exceptionally valuable contribution. For the sake of China and its children, we naturally hope that the entire film industry will continue to work hard on this.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to say: "Little Angel" was produced for families with children, and families with children should not let it down!</p>
<h3>Star's New Films Released</h3>
<p>The Star Film Company has always been a place where talent gathers. Currently, there are four films that have been completed and are awaiting public release, all of which are full-dialogue, singing, and sound films.</p>
<p>(1) "Big Family," directed by Zhang Shichuan, stars the entire cast of male and female stars from Star, depicting a large family gradually collapsing under the influence of social recession, reflecting the sinister nature of people's hearts and various negative aspects of the big city, with a wide range of elements and many humorous moments, highly suited to the tastes of the general audience.</p>
<p>(3) "Night Fragrance," directed by Cheng Bugao, stars Hu Die, Zhao Dan, and Shu embroidery Wen. It depicts the various misfortunes of a flower girl (played by Hu Die) who is lured by vanity. The plot is extremely tortuous and sorrowful, showcasing Hu Die's elaborate work after returning to China.</p>
<p>(3) "Jade Horse," directed by Xu Xinfu, stars Wang Zhengxin, Ji Jianong, Yan Yuexian, and Gu Lanrong, with the anti-drug movement as its theme. The film features grand sets, such as bizarre and winding secret rooms and tunnels, and magnificent and luxurious new-style buildings. The whole film is full of tension and terror. Reviewers know that directing martial arts detective films is Xu's forte.</p>
<p>(4) "Boatman's Daughter," directed by Shen Xiling, stars Gao Zhanfei, Xu Lai, Sun Min, and others. Lao Gao plays a worker here, which is perfect for his personality. In "Boatman's Daughter," he clearly achieves amazing results. Xu Lai, Sun Min, and others also display a variety of emotions. Director Shen Xiling is praised as the director who "understands film" the most, and here, he has achieved even greater success than "Nostalgia."</p>
<p>The five films that are in the planning stage and awaiting production are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) "Peach Blossoms After the Calamity" will be directed by Zhang Shichuan and star Hu Die and Gao Zhanfei. The script is by Hong Shen (originally published in literature). (2) "Brothers' Journey" is Zheng Zhengqiu's unfinished work "He Died Before He Could Succeed," which will now be co-directed by Cheng Bugao and Zheng Xiaoqiu, starring Hu Die, Gao Zhanfei, and others. (2) "Love Letter" will be written and directed by Li Pingqian, with Hu Die, Gao Zhanfei, and Ye Qiuxin already chosen as the main cast. (4) "Spring Flower" will be written and directed by Wu Cun, with Gao Zhanfei already confirmed for the main cast, and possibly the entire cast of "Remarriage." (5) "New People, Old People" will be directed by Cheng Bugao, with the main cast yet to be determined. All of the above are sound films.</p>
<h3>Yuan Meiyun and Child Star Liu in "Victory Song"</h3>
<h3>Publishing World</h3>
<p>Since its publication, Ying Wu News has been deeply welcomed by people in the film and dance circles because of its well-informed news and many gimmicks. It is reported that the sixth issue has now been published, with many wonderful articles such as "A Eulogy for Dancing Star Li Meimei" and "One of Yuan Meiyun's Foster Brothers"... all of which are rare gems. In addition, a flower news column has been specially opened to publish anecdotes and love histories from the flower world. This issue is particularly rich, and the dance star trailer registration has been published in succession since the last issue. There is also an article about the scandalous history of the three dance queen sisters, which will be published in the next issue.</p>
