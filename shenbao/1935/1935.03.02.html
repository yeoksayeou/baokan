<h3>救濟上海市面之商榷</h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>上海市地方恊會。市商會。銀行錢業等兩公會等團體。有鑒於最近市面蕭條。百業不振。非速圖挽救。難免江河日下。釀成不堪設想之局面。乃召集會議。討論救濟方案。并推代表謁孔財長。面陳救濟辦法。可謂急其所應急矣。其所陳救濟辦法。爲請財部令中央銀行指撥巨欵。放欵於工商業界。以調劑並穩定市面。而放欵之抵押品。則爲地産及貨物。就急則治標之意義言。此項救濟辦法。自屬適當。今孔財長已採納此種陳請。分别函令中央·中國·交通·三銀行。對於各業之提供確實抵押品。請求借欵者。務須盡力承放。以維市面。而使各業均能活潑發展。是則救濟上海市面之初歩方策已在着手進行中。但我人尚有不能已於言者。</p>
<p>上海市况之蕭條。其外來之原因。爲受世界經濟恐慌之影響。其國內之原因。則爲中國農村破産。人民購買力之薄弱。以故根本救濟之道。自當從世界市塲上及農村經濟上着眼。關於世界市塲。暫時非我人能力之所能左右。今置弗論。至復興農村經濟。就整個救濟方策言。實應與治標方策。同時並進。蓋若僅以請求銀行放欵爲出路。則充其量。亦不過暫時資金上之調濟而已。此暫時調劑後之第二歩如何。則問題又將隨之而起。至中央銀行爲銀行之銀行。其應否受不動産及貨物之抵押而放欵。則猶另一問題也。故竊謂宜以治標之方策救市面暫時之急。以復興農村。防止治標方策進行後之再陷於窘境。標本同治。話似近迂。而實爲唯一應取之道。吾人所願與今日談救濟市面諸君商榷者。此其一。</p>
<p>就上海救濟市面之治標方策言。則地産業者之自動减輕房租。實爲救濟市面之有效方法。往昔上海市况繁榮。地價與房租。隨之昻貴。其價之高。不特爲全國各地冠。亦漸占世界之地位。此所謂水漲則船高也。今市况蕭條。商品抑價競賣。尚是銷路不暢。工商業者。對於巨額房租之負擔。夫豈能勝。試觀積欠房租至數月以上者。比比皆是。甚有因而倒閉者。可以知之矣。影響所及。地價暴跌。市多虚宅。地産業者將有同歸於盡之虞。吾人深知上海地産業界。不乏明達之士。能自動减租以輕工商界之負擔。所以救濟市面。亦所以自救之道也。夫活動市面。須求貨物去路之流暢。而吸引人民購買之趣味。以促貨物去路得以流暢之方法。莫要於使貨品廉價。若房租不减。工商業者肩有重荷。以言廉價。虧累必巨。此義甚淺。普通人多能知之。地産界知之而尚多狃於近利。不能實行。故督促地産界實行减租。又爲今日談救濟市面諸君之責也。吾人願與諸君商榷者。此其二。</p>

<p>［柏林］元首希特勒今日正式宣布、以三月一日爲「自由日」紀念薩爾歸德、並特赦薩爾區內人犯數千、此項特赦係减免普通初犯之罪、「政治犯」則概不在內、薩爾區內對於國社政府之感情非常濃厚、現在接得此項命令、自當更爲興高采烈、故於「自由」紀念日將大舉慶祝、至希氏之特赦初犯、則一般人視爲係表示感謝人民於投票之時信任德國政制云、（二十八日國民電）</p>
<h3>警權前夕移交</h3>
<p>薩爾白魯根　薩爾領土之與祖國歸併雖須至明日、惟薩爾區內之警權、則已於今日正式移交於德國、其原因係以三月一日薩爾領土歸併於德之時、德國人民前往參加慶祝者不下數十萬人、秩序至難維持、德當局既須於該日開始担負維持治安之責、勢必須先一日取得警權也、今日德政府接收警權之代表爲薩森博士、薩森自薩爾統治委員會會長諾克斯手中接受警權之後、即委任衝鋒隊領袖施梅歇氏爲薩爾區警察總監、（廿八日國民電）</p>
<h3>法國國旗絶跡</h3>
<p>薩爾白魯根　法國所主管各礦産建築、所懸法國國旗、已於今晚一律缷下、十五年來、國聯會在薩爾之政權、一旦終、法國國旗從此不復見諸薩爾領土矣、明晨三人委員會主席諾克斯、將以薩爾區域政權正式移轉德國當局、德國陣綫團員三十萬人、將於明日慶祝薩爾光復故國、薩爾區域歸併德國後、將作爲特别行政區域、由內務部長費列克直接管轄、（廿八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>諾克斯膺爵位</h3>
<p>倫敦英皇今日以爵位賜與前薩爾統治委員會主席諾克斯、此素享盛名之「薩爾偉人」、遂爲聖來克爾及聖僑治級之武士長、諾克斯爵士現年五十歳、爲一沈摯之英人、具蘇格蘭人之才幹、愛爾蘭人之智慧、於此亦可推測其祖先之混合血統、今日皇室所賜之殊榮、爲終身服務帝國者所得之酬報、諾克斯爲自英國領事館躍入外交界少數人才中之一人、最初曾充舌人云、（廿八日國民電）</p>

<p>［維也納］維也納大學學生數百人、今午聚集大學禮堂、預備慶祝薩爾之歸德、方高唱日耳曼民族歌時、學校當局即鳴警隊、招呼警察、於是被捕者達二百餘名、其理由爲最近政府曾有命令公告、不准在奥國境內舉行一切有關薩爾歸德之種種游行示威或慶祝運動、（二十八日國民電）</p>
<h3>華盛頓充滿日間諜恐怖空氣</h3>
<p>喬裝汽車夫探聽消息</p>
<p>大飛艇失事啓人疑竇</p>
<p>［華盛頓］神鬼不測之日本間諜、今日又出現華盛頓官塲、自飛艇專家克那本兩次聲明、大飛艇麥康號之墮海、由於有人破壞機器所致後、衆議員西羅維立即宣稱、美國戰艦上僱用數千亞洲人、故一旦與日本開戰、彼等或將繼續破壞工作、西羅維繼稱、日本間諜在華盛頓獲得汽車夫之職務、藉此探聽官員之談話、外間盛傳日本車夫費盡心機、將汽車停上國務院及海軍部附近、希望竊聽美國官員之批評、通知東京云、西羅維爲衆院執照委員會主席、故在名義上負調查麥康號出事之責任、由渠建議、克那本始向委員會作證、克氏一再聲稱、遇難之麥康號上斐人侍役、或以酸類灌澆金屬板、致使麥康號落入太平洋中、該侍役係日人後裔云（廿日國民電）</p>
<h3>美國注意日本經濟援華</h3>
<p>認爲違反九國公約</p>
<p>［華盛頓］日來美國及若干其他九國公約之簽字國家、對於中國之財政狀况、頗爲注意、而尤以中日親善一事爲最甚、華盛頓官塲方面固不願有所討論、惟據可靠方面消息、此間當局對於目前中國之財政危機、深爲扼腕、且極關懷、究竟美國之白銀政策曾否發生損害、此間官塲對於任何恊助中國之舉皆表同情、惟不願一國單獨進行、若干熟悉情形者以爲中日親善之程度、或者不致如上海消息所傳之甚、華盛頓及東京之日人、皆稱不知有經濟助華之事、彼等堅稱日本惟欲調和中日之關係而已、按美國向來之對華政策、向以九國公約所表示之各國恊作援助中國爲基點、故對於單獨助華、大概不能贊同云、（廿八日國民電）</p>
<h3>赤白兩問題促成中日妥協</h3>

<p>紐約專家之觀察</p>
<p>［紐約］外交政策恊會專家皮歇潑今日宣稱、美國之購銀計劃、促成中國統貨之收縮、此實爲中日妥恊之主因、皮氏復論及蘇俄問題對於中國及日本所生之影響稱、兩國之共同利益、在於阻止共産黨故中日兩國因經濟的與政治的關係、遂進行相互提携、據上海傳來之報告稱、此項恊調將使日本獨覇遠東之計劃、更進一歩、同時日本將處於不得不與蘇俄開戰之地位、日本領袖現在預料此事云、（二十八日國民電）</p>

<h3>日本否認提造艦休日案</h3>
<p>［東京］外務省與海軍省今日皆否認倫敦傳來日本擬提前自一九三五年至三八年海軍停止造艦三年之説、外務省發言人今日於外國新聞記者詢及此事時聲稱、日政府並未知有此種提議、日本海軍政策已在倫敦談話時説明其目的、在根據日本提案而成立一種新協定、日政府認此提案爲公允平等、渠未見政府態度有何變更、渠亦未見山本自倫敦返國後提交政府之報告書中、有主張停止造艦之計畫云、（一日路透電）</p>
<h3>日軍部發行小册激剌戰爭情緒</h3>

<h3>英法外長巴黎談話兩國共同立塲不變</h3>
<p>確認倫敦宣言整個不可分</p>
<p>西門訪德僅限於探詢性質</p>
<p>［巴黎］本日英法兩國外長在英國駐法大使館宴會席間及宴會後、舉行談話、歷兩小時餘、參加談話者除法外長賴伐爾·英外相西門外、人數極少、且相約保守緘默、故外間無從探得消息、但聞英法外長就二月三日之倫敦宣言書、作澈底之探討後、業經確定兩國所已採取之共同立塲、並無變更、德國雖企圖將倫敦宣言書中各項要素、各相分離、然英法兩國則始終承認倘欲求歐洲之真正和平、則英法提議必須保持其不可分性、英法所提議之天空公約·多瑙河公約·東歐公約·德國重返日內瓦·簽訂軍備限制公約等各節、有同等之重要、必須同時加以討論、欲解决其中之一節、必使其他各節一併解决而後可、此外並聞西門訪德、將僅限於採訪性質、西門將向德國政府領袖説明倫敦恊定之目的及範圍、二月十七日德國致英法之覆文、僅述及天空公約一項、西門則將向德國政府探詢對於英法恊定之整個意見、嗣後西門將即返英國、俾與法國恊同考慮談判是否有再行發展之可能、屆時或將派員赴莫斯科·華沙·及捷克京城一行、至於西門訪問東歐各國首都之日期、偶而延遲、並未含有他意、蓋蘇聯固尚未作正式之邀請也、且西門赴東歐游歷、本屬限定俄波兩國、現此種計劃亦不妨略加變更、蓋捷克等國與東歐互助公約有特殊之關係、西門或亦有順道往訪之必要也、總之此次英法談話、業經重行確定英法兩國仍抱倫敦宣言書中所聲明之共同見解、查西門往訪德國之舉、法國自始表示信任、今西門啓程赴德之前、英法復有此種意見一致之表示、不可謂非極關重要也、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］據可靠方面消息、英外相西門將於下星期杪赴柏林、作二三日之勾留、藉與德元首希特勒氏籌商一切、又據新聞聯合社消息、謂西門氏或將作莫斯科及華沙之遊、惟西門將先由柏林逕返倫敦、將其與德當局所談判者向內閣報告、以資取决、如事實上有往蘇俄之必要者、則即往莫斯科、至掌璽大臣艾登是否偕西門同至柏林一節則尚未决定、因各方頗不贊成西門艾登與司丹和撲（現在日內瓦）三重要外交人員同時離京也、（一日國民社電）</p>

<h3>英暫不運用平準金鎊價續趨疲弱</h3>
<p>巴黎謡傳英美幕後諒解</p>

<p>隊兵全體動員</p>
<p>發表告市民書</p>
<p>市保安處及該處黨部、爲厲行新生活起見、特舉行淸潔運動、以引起市民之注意、原定二月二十一·二十二·二十三·三日、分别內外、施行檢查內務與掃除通衢街道、屆時忽春雨連綿、內務檢查、固不受影響、遵照規定舉行、惟對外之掃除工作、則施展爲難、以致一再展期、直至昨日、天氣晴朗、已適宜於掃除工作之推行、於是該處處長及該處黨部常委楊嘯天氏、特令飭全體隊兵黨員、遵照原定時間、一致動員、出發洒掃通衢街道、兹記其詳情如次、</p>
<p>掃除情形</p>
<p>昨日上午八時、該處各隊兵黨員、除有勤務在外、均集合隊部、由各區指揮糾導、加以細密之檢查與訓話、以期各項動作、適合處方規定、而收以身作則之效、一迄九時、各區隊振隊出發、紛紛到達各指定區域執行洒掃、一時掃帚鐵鏟、飛舞全市、塵垢穢汚、悉入籮中、擔架隊將掃得垃圾、納諸垃圾箱內、並檢視垃圾箱左右、是否淸潔、故往來頻繁、頗形忙碌、各指揮糾導、則彳亍廵梭、以求整飭、幹道掃竣、而猶未達規定實掃二小時半者、則分掃左右巷弄、故工作至爲完整細密、其區域遼闊者、直至下午一時、猶有洒掃者、執行任務、</p>
<p>宣傳一斑</p>
<p>洒掃擔架各隊、執行其規定任務時、而宣傳隊亦紛紛出發活動、除散發宣傳品外、復施行口頭宣傳、説明淸潔運動之意義與目的、辭語簡明、娓娓動聽、激發市民之愛好淸潔情緒、收效至宏、其對於市民住宅四圍、有塵穢不潔者、一面由洒掃隊、代爲洒掃、一面由宣傳隊加以勸導、務使市民樂於接受淸潔運動之本意、又聞洒掃隊代市民宅前洒掃時、各市民將奮起自動執箕帚淸除塵穢亦甚多、斯則推動民衆、轉移社會風尚、於潛移默化之中、已有顯著之成效矣、</p>
<p>檢查狀况</p>
<p>該處及黨部、爲檢視成績、評定優劣起見、爰有檢查人員之指派、昨日亦按時廵行全市、於隊員之精神及動作、均予以詳細之檢查、據該檢查人員云、洒掃·擔架·宣傳·工作大致均能勤奮從事、惟移風易俗、端在有恒、在政者固然要厲行不怠、而民衆亦須努力恊助、</p>

<h3>各界昨續商救濟申新七廠辦法</h3>
<p>滙豐態度已趨和緩</p>
<p>中央社云、匯豐銀行、此次擅自拍賣申新第七廠、國人莫不痛恨、政府對此更屬注意、兹將昨日所得消息、分誌如下、</p>
<p>呈請政府加以救濟</p>
<p>中央社云、政府對於此次申新七廠被拍賣事件、異常注意、除致電吳市長就近向英方交涉外、孔財長特於前日電令中央銀行、召集銀行界領袖、及關係各方、研商救濟辦法、中央銀行奉令後、業於前晚、召開會議、研商救濟辦法、據出席會議者語中央社記者、此次會議席上、業經商定救濟之辦法、即爲呈請政府、加以救濟、此項辦法、業於當晚電漢、向孔財長報告、須俟孔財長核准之後、始可實行、惟截止昨晚爲止、中央銀行及關係各方、尚未奉到孔財長之復電、至於呈請政府救濟辦法之內容、須俟當局核准之後、始可發表、</p>
<p>陳氏連日在滬調查</p>
<p>新聲社記者探悉、實業部部長陳公博氏、自到滬後、對申新紡織七廠事件、極爲關心、連日親自調查該廠負債實况、藉資設法救濟、以維我紗業界前途、迄至昨日止、陳氏對調查結果、認爲匯豐雖係履行條約、但行動顯屬非法、况債務人與債權人國籍殊異、决將據理交涉力爭、</p>
<p>市長私邸會商救濟</p>
<p>市長吳鐵城接奉行政院命令對申新廠事設法交涉、同時實業部部長陳公博、迭據各團體電告、即於前日來滬、會同市府籌謀挽救辦法、自與吳市長晤談後、認爲該廠取贖問題、尚有挽回希望、惟以經濟爲重心、故於昨日中午、在海格路吳市長公館、邀請金融界領袖張公權·陳行·李馥蓀·陳光甫·唐壽民·及市府秘書長俞鴻鈞·等會商補救辦法、歷時頗久、</p>
<p>匯豐表示當可挽回</p>
<p>匯豐銀行當局、鑒於我國民氣、十分緊張、故連日對此事態度、業已改變、據較可靠消息、匯豐滬行大班赫區門氏之態度、甚能原諒申新、赫氏曾非正式向關係方面表示、若申新能有辦法、則匯豐念以往中英交邦之密切、决不使之難堪、華東社記者曾於昨日往訪該行華買辦龔子漁、據稱、本人對此事始末、並未預聞、故內容如何、並未詳悉、微聞各界已積極設法援助、如各方真有誠意、則匯豐或有撤消拍賣之可能云云、</p>
<p>買方律師昨未繳欵</p>
<p>此次投標請買申新七廠之某方代理人岡本·村上·兩律師、本有定昨日繳欵之舉、惟據岡氏昨語華東社記者稱、因匯豐與申新尚有糾紛、故繳欵之日、當屬有待、至於何時繳欵、則須視匯豐能將貨物（即指申新七廠）交代爲移歸云、記者旋詢以購主究係誰屬、岡氏仍如拍賣時之笑而不答、</p>
<p>各團體昨聯合請願</p>
<p>上海申新紗廠第七廠、自被匯豐銀行非法拍賣後、本市各團體、無不憤慨、昨日上午十時、國貨工廠聯合會張子廉·總工會周學湘·中華工業總聯合會錢承緒·中華國産廠商聯合會陳炳輝·市民提倡國貨會王介安·陸星莊·機器染織公會諸文綺·聯合向市政府吳市長請願、因市長感冒未愈、由郭秘書代爲延見、首由各代表陳述申新七廠被匯豐銀行拍賣經過、倘産權一經轉移、交涉上更多困難、故此希望請求中央、撥下現欵二百二十五萬元、繳還匯豐到期欵項、否則徒托空言、與事無補、以物質上作有力之援助、庶國家主權無損害、國內實業得政府扶助而發展云云、當由郭秘書允將上述情形、轉達市長、呈請中央核辦、各代表即行辭出、</p>
<p>日報希望岡本善處</p>
<p>昨日日文每日新聞云、自申新七廠拍賣後、俄然引起社會上絶大衝動、中國方面急電紛飛、各團體激越異常、輿論亦頗强硬、其風潮日益擴大、但出面收買代理人岡本律師、因未吐露實情、以致各國人、均有揣摩臆測、特岡本爲日本人、各方咸謂其背景、係日本商社、如此遷延、徒刺激中國國民與各國人之神經、而大連汽船南滿鐵道會社等、又受多大之迷惑、因此事務之進行、發生種種障碍、且其他日本商店、在交易上、亦受惡劣影響、現值中日關係轉變之際、在極東國際情勢複雜微妙之關係上、恐非限於此區區紗廠問題、萬一不愼、難免發生其他危險的國際問題、我日本人間、深望岡本律師、加以深慮善處、最低限度、亦當闡明日本方面之立塲、夜長夢多、結果如何、頗堪注目云、</p>

<h3>證劵</h3>
<p>多空觀望中之債市</p>
<p>漲跌均見爲數極微</p>
<p>昨華商證劵交易所、市面極爲平定、仍入於盤旋之途、交易亦大爲淸减、如編遺及一九關一九善三種之遠期、則全日未有做開、大户買賣不動、市上零星及掉期交易較爲熱鬧、多空雙方以期限充裕、各存觀望、市價因擯持而入盤旋、最近漢口召開財政重要會議、其關於公債市塲必多、在目下環境無新消息時、前途不易引起波動、昨日經過、每盤均係高低不一、互有參差、上午頭盤、漲多跣少、次盤即跌多漲少、均在一二角間盤旋、除掉期交易外、新買賣甚少成交、午後兩盤、稍稍轉疲、但仍參差不齊、大都均係跌多漲少、爲數愈微、市面吊滯、無甚榮辱、市價結果、廿捲及統鹽税本月份均好五分一角、其他各種大都均小五分一角至二角、有四種則毫無上落者、廿三關亦趨於穩定、成交總數、共計祗六百零四萬三千元、兹將其漲跌結果、列比較表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<p>紐約股市跌多漲少</p>
<p>新豐洋行報告、昨（二十八日）紐約股市、趨勢盤旋、參差帶軟、綜計二月份中所做之交易、其數量之小、爲一九二一年以來之二月份所未有、昨美元對英滙價暴漲、但對金本位各國貨幣則屬低落、糖股因糖價漲而亦漲、鐵道股初開尚堅、末後因據五十一家頭等鐵路報告、在一月份內該路等之總收入增加百分之三·二、但以材料漲價、工資與税欵增高、故營業净收入反較去年一月份减少百分之二·九云云、故近收盤時又見回落、債市漲跌不一、惟鐵路債劵則獨呈挺秀、小交易所股票微升、全日成交五十七萬股、兹將道瓊斯指數列左、</p>
<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>紗花漲後回跌</p>
<p>紗市上日回漲、昨則又告下落、足見市面之虚弱矣、實以某紗價廉、銀根依然緊廹、故本月份紗雖有同業中組織多頭公司、然環境未見十分良好、大漲希望、恐不可能、不過買方均用極大力量做作、前途仍在波瀾中、</p>
<p>遠期紗降達一元半</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、因外棉傾向下游、各月均呈呆滯不前、三月期受多方之拉力尚平、惟拍至遠月趨跌、賣者益衆、拍至二三盤、聞金市不振、匯兑放長、人氣愈挫、據市塲言、某商又抛出、結果各月又跌三六八角至一元、午後塲中買户未旺、且棉花大跌、致啓齒相關之紗市、難以過漲、各月又跌五六七八角、查賣出元一一千二百包、恒德一千二百包、瑞大一千四百包、均昶九百五十包、同興五百包、生源七百五十包、大孚九百包、通記九百五十包、買進大豐八百五十包、穗隆七百五十包、愼記一千九百包、澗康九百包、源大五百五十包、頤大五百包、長豐六百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>
<p>實銷一千四百包弱</p>
<p>現紗銷路尚好、查全日各帮買去統計一千三百九十五包、行情平疲、各帮買額如下、</p>
<p>棉市趨疲、跌勢歩趨歩熾、實因海外棉市下落、匯兑一味猛升、以致採算價日廉、而上海棉花存貨雄厚、據棉業中人云、各方産地之花、尚有許多未曾運輸出境、所以對於棉市、竭力的觀疲、</p>
<p>遠月花跌進六元關</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、各月均呈大跌之狀、且賣風劇烈、美印棉市轉跌、匯兑歩長、外棉採算價日見接近、同時現棉存貨、一時不易銷罄、銀根仍緊、廠方需要减縮、故棉市脚地較鬆、人心怠懈、各月均跌四角半至六角半、午後開盤、仍屬不穩、聞金市趨下、塲中某投機界將多頭大批了結、市盤歩開歩低、市上現交易告絶、故各月重現新低峯、遠月敲破六元關口、結果各月又跌五分至三角半、查賣出潤康一萬五千四百担、長和九千四百担、均昶一千九百担、遠大一千五百担、通記二千二百担、合興一千七百担、賡豐二千担、長餘二千四百担、元一二千四百担、長豐二千四百担、益康一千五百担、買進吉豐二千六百担、大孚四千八百担、穗隆三千九百担、源大六千九百担、均昶二千一百担、愼記三千五百担、益昶一千六百担、生源三千一百担、永大一千八百担、源興昌一千五百担、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>
<p>現棉廠需停頓</p>
<p>現棉消費、益覺冷静、良以滙兑連長不已、外棉續跌、紗市又萎、廠需岑寂、生意愈稀云、</p>
<p>八月期紗花花紗等級略有升降</p>
<p>二十支富貴紗等級再降一元爲减七元</p>
<p>本市紗市交易所、於上月二十五日開棉花鑑定會議、供給二十四年八月期交割之用、結果鑑定等級升降、將第一級中乙等原加四元半、改加四元正、丙等原加三元五角、改加三元正、丁等原加二元五角、改加二元正、第二級中甲等原加一元五角、改加一元正、其餘第三級第四級均無變動、兹將更改程序及等級價格、摘錄於下、</p>
<p>第一級</p>
<p>新訂價　　舊訂價</p>
<p>甲等　加八元正　加八元正</p>
<p>乙等　加四元正　加四元五角</p>
<p>丙等　加三元正　加三元五角</p>
<p>丁等　加二元正　加二元五角</p>
<p>第二級</p>
<p>甲等　加一元正　加一元五角</p>
<p>又棉紗審查會於上月二十六日召集鑑定會議、以供二十四年八月期爲交割代用品、結果將恒豐廠之二十支富貴紗、七月期照等級减六元、現改减七元、又恒豐廠十六支富貴紗七月期照等級减十九元、現改二十元、再降一元、其餘二十支·十六支·十支紗全無變更、與七月期相同、又溥益廠牌號、現新裕廠牌紗牌未曾改動、仍係地球牌爲名云、</p>
<p>華商紗布交易市塲揭示、自三月一日起、對於三月期標花、所做新買賣、每擔增收特别證金二元、兩存賬收取一方云、</p>
<p>新棉政策未定奪前美經紀商抛賣遠期</p>
<p>昨日美棉開盤、散户了結、各月跌一至四磅音、旋以同業需求尚殷、稍轉平穩、惟經紀商因政府對於新棉政策、尚未定奪、抛賣遠期、同時三月期多須續有了結、致市價常在低峯盤旋、收盤平平、計現貨跌十磅音、期貨跌三至八磅音、英棉市况穩固、現貨漲四點、期貨漲一至四點、印棉初以多頭了結而疲、旋因日商買進而堅、卒以買户缺乏再疲、計平果爾跌三羅比、奥姆辣跌一·五羅比、白羅溪跌一·二五羅比、原電錄左、（二十八日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、一日白羅溪花之開盤預測、爲二百四十四羅比半、較上日收盤跌一二五羅比、</p>
<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>期粉麥午後狂瀉</p>
<p>金市歩跌…廠方續抛</p>
<p>麵紛粉市上午開盤後、以洋麥芝加哥小八分至一角六分坎拿大跌一二角左右、當開價時、以各廠方面、鑒於現銷之緊軋、故有現貨加價之舉、是以開價時、即因此種原因、人心堅定、近期月份、曾較前日收價開高一分至二分不等、如三四月份高至二元四角零二厘半、不料金市又生劇變、市面大落、此項國際上之經濟傾軋、似與我國之進口物品、又予莫大之便利、故二盤後、抛貨漸湧、市氣又歩歩下跌、迨至下午開盤、因事實上之傾向、利於空頭、廠方既歩歩抛售、多頭又忍痛反賣、市氣遂一落千丈、頗有無從挽救之勢、結果本月份跌三分七厘半、四五月份跌四分二厘半、（按照上午之開價則跌六七分之巨、）六月份跌四分半、七月份跌四分、八月份初開三角八分、收價祗三角零七厘半、計跌七分二厘半云、</p>
<p>小麥昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈初漲繼落之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥跌八分至一角六分、坎拿大跌一二角左右、當開價時、以洋麥小勢不巨、兼以前月底之紛市回漲、故人心反見良好、三四月份曾好二四分不等、旋以粉市不振、及金市之鬆跌、市氣已呈萎靡、迨至下午開盤、市面竟亦大跌不已、一因粉市跌勢之狂、二因阿麥之合價、價四元二角八分、一部分並傳廠家有續定之説、故人心大虚、抛賣不絶、照國際間匯市之傾軋不已、前途尚未許樂觀也、結果三月份暴跌一角四分、四月分跌一角三分、七月份跌八分、八月份標準、初開四角半、收價亦跌一角、現麥市面、因到存不多、廠化尚殷、市見平穩、開海州麥三元八角四分、明光臨淮關麥三元八角三分、頴州崑山麥三元八角四分、由福新辦去二千包云、</p>
<p>河下米市無甚榮辱</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源忽稀、共祗十餘號、（貨共近二千石）惟銷塲方面、零躉兩胃亦懈、若包胃祗辦二百餘包、故市色成到銷兩平、其各厚梗及薄稻價悉呈定局、無甚榮辱也、杜尖續軟、陰變元銷滯、亦繼下游耳、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路到船念一二號、市上各貨去胃取巧稍化、市價白粳薄稻白元小五六分客尖零銷雖呆、因存貨不多、客心頗堅、價無上落、</p>
<p>洋米晨疲午定</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况、上午空氣甚劣、因到頭不絶、進户停手覯望、市乃繼跌、幸到午後忽有漢口九江兩帮趁小收買千餘包、內地跟辦、本街進胃亦漸活絡、市乃由疲轉定、統市開出西貢二千八百包、暹邏小絞高貢各米二千包、客秈三百五十包、去胃以本街爲主、惟後形以洋米存到兩充、人心仍不免虚軟耳、</p>
<p>紅糧有供不應求狀</p>
<p>昨日紅糧市况、依然緊俏、原因大連開原價昻、來源絶少、申存紅壳已缺、致長沙帮祗可俯就歸德等糧、昨計辦去開原冲紅壳一車、價開四元一角行情、比上日再漲一角、又去歸德糧八百餘包、價自三元五角半至五角、蚌埠糧三車價爲三元四角至三角半、行情均漲五分至一角、刻下形居供不應求、市勢有榮無辱、餘外去路、似內地及東洋帮因價高故觀望、黄荳銷塲懈淡、人心趨疲、前途趨勢、暫少振作之形、</p>
<h3>南北貨</h3>
<p>蘭花子地價再漲</p>
<p>蘭花子因去冬天氣乾旱、末水貨收採有限、是以存底極缺、上月零星稍有運到、開貨已漲近十元、查昨大名輸入口、僅到十數件、據貨客函訊成本又漲、故號盤復叫高二三元、趨勢堅穩、</p>
<h3>糖市</h3>
<p>粤粗白標價無變動</p>
<p>成交一、七三五包</p>
<p>昨日糖市、趨勢平平、粤粗砂白由糖業合作公司標售出一千七百三十五包、價爲十六元六角、無上落、轉口荷二四粗白仍標原價四元八角五分、無成交、本廠綿白比前日續小一角、振裕一號爲十六元三角、二號十六元二角、三號十六元零五分、四號十五元九角、號盤有潮帮開出黄崗青等一千餘包、黄崗青爲十元三角二角半二角、隆港青九元三角半、比小五分、據汕頭函訊、去冬潮青共計出産六十餘萬包、現在已銷去三十餘萬包、故産地主觀情形、比去年市價當看有升無跌之象、且汕滙昨訊又降近十元、成本又須加高角許、廣帮開出北海片青二百數十箱、價八元九角、比跌角許、建帮開出刁青數十包、價爲九元五角、比前盤跌去三角、</p>
<h3>絲茶</h3>
<p>湖綢廠擬辦白廠經</p>

<h3>蘇州七塔</h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>蘇州向有「七塔八幢」之説。所謂「幢」，是以磚甃成，纍高七級，出屋外，自遠望之，形如浮圖而較小；相傳這是劉伯温所造，以作厭勝之用的。至於七塔，或謂城中僅見有四—北寺塔，瑞光塔，雙塔，而白塔不與—合以城外虎邱塔，靈巖塔，上方塔，便成七塔。</p>
<p>一説，蘇州七塔，是專指城中言；城外的三塔，是並在內的。那七塔，就是：北寺塔，瑞光塔，雙塔，白塔，石塔，（今已圯，石塔頭即其遺址，）尚有某塔，談者已忘其名。</p>
<p>近閲褚人穫堅瓠續集卷三，有宫巷濂溪坊塔一則云：</p>
<p>「郡中宫巷，有塔高丈餘，合圍約七八尺。塔頂乃鐵鑄者，然兩三人於下摇之，則擺動若樹木然，鈴鐸自鳴，蓋其下必有機軸，而神匠之所遺巧也。又，濂溪坊有小塔，正與宫巷口相對。故老曰，昔年烟霧中，以紅綠線在塔之半截處，兩人拽之，横牽可過，並無窒礙。後有異人識破，不復可牽矣。」</p>
<p>據此，參以前説，是蘇州城中向有八塔。如果濂溪坊小塔列爲附庸，不能作數，則適合城中七塔之説。按現在蘇州，不但濂溪坊小塔莫知其處，即宫巷塔及石塔的遺址亦不可尋。所聳峙於城中的，只有北寺塔瑞光塔和雙塔四塔而已，至於白塔，徒有其表，實無凌雲之致，似乎還配不上稱做「塔」。</p>
<h3>標準大學生</h3>
<p>— 木木</p>
<p>余識標凖大學生於衛生五香花生米攤畔，所謂「萍水相逢」者是，彼係××大學新聞學學系學生，談吐每涉及當代新聞文化界名人言行，且能仿學各教授狀態，一舉一動，唯妙唯肖，尤好交文友，勤於通信，據稱每月郵票所費，需大洋三元左右，亦云巨矣。</p>
<p>標準大學生其「標凖」之點有五：一，不穿西裝革履（軍訓制服列外）。二，不上跳舞塲，不跑狗，不溜冰，不打高爾富。三，不與紅透天的什麽皇后校花之類的異性交際（反之，賣香瓜子的阿鳳，洗衣老太婆……倒很新近）。四，不把老粗的「派克」插在衣襟上，不把挺厚的洋書帶上軍車，不帶没光的白金眼鏡。五，舉凡白米幾元一石，小黄魚幾鈿一兩……爲其他大學生所不容易得知的，彼却獨能對答如流。</p>
<p>某月某日，承其不棄，惠條約飲於附近某小酒店，京莊一壺，發芽豆一盆，乾切一攤，談笑言歡，半酣，彼拍肩謂余曰：「人生，哈，人生！我們不要把它看得太嚴重，否則，就先去了人生的真趣，可是，我們亦不能把它看得太輕渺，否則，就没有了人生的意義，不入調的瞎摩登，果然惡劣，假惺惺的表面道學，亦覺無謂得很呢。」</p>
<p>余自識標凖大學生後，確能於不知不覺中被其點破迷津，得益良多，昨承惠贈玉照一幅，布衣書生，悃幅無華，十里洋塲，能找出幾個？</p>

<h3>胞衣科學的製藥</h3>
<p>— （希農）</p>
<p>（接一月二十三日科學趣談）</p>
<p>至我們這樣的「非大夫」那更祗有希奇，神秘甚或荒誕之慈了！然而事實竟是出人意外的，近經德人愛爾哈脱博士之實驗，竟果然發見由胞衣中可以製得一種很重要的藥劑——黄體內泌素，而且是多量地存在着。黄體內泌素原爲卵巢內成熟濾胞排出卵子後之産物，在生理上具使子宫黏膜增殖並疏鬆的作用，以備容納受孕之卵子；但現亦已成爲婦科醫療上之要藥，凡易小産的婦女，注射此劑後，可不至墮胎，並當婦人器官急性出血時，有起死回生的止血作用，惟以此劑之提製甚難，且有效製劑之價值甚巨，故還不能普遍地爲臨牀上的應用。而現今據愛氏的報告，六百至八百個猪的卵巢祗能提製三十至三十五內泌素有效單位，在一個（人物）胞衣內則已能製得十單位。這樣，無疑地吾人，所認爲穢物的胞衣，在新藥界中亦已成爲重要藥劑之原料，雖然其功效與我國舊醫所經騐或想像的截然不同。</p>
<h3>妙聯拾雋</h3>
<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>此次熊秉老，與毛彦文女士，結婚於慕爾堂，賀聯已見報載者，美不勝收，傳爲佳話；日前余於席間，偶談及此，老友秦君慕三，曰：「吾亦有一聯，惜與鳳凰無一日之雅，未能博諸名流一欣賞耳！衆聞，固叩之，曰：「明月正懸雲錦妙」「好花重放燕歸前；」咸不解其用意之何在，默然者久之；秦君曰：「諸公休矣，吾特拈其姓，何索解之難如是耶？」</p>
<p>嗣秦君析爲其旨趣，皆歎服；蓋秉老姓「熊」，起筆係「厶」，此乃「雲」字之脚，而「雲」古寫如「？」，一若雲之紋錦無異，「厶」下加「月」字，是一輪明月恰懸其下，豈非好看煞人乎？此上聯之意；「熊」字左旁，係「　」，是花字之一半，似上下兩花並開，至春而怒放；下有四點，作「一」寫，非火也，乃燕字之尾，核其字義，知燕尚未歸，故曰燕歸前，此下聯之意也；余佩其拈一「熊」字，而鈎心鬬角，却在阿堵中，爰拾錄之，以博閲者一粲。</p>

<h3>世界名酒考（上）</h3>

<p>上下數千年，縱横數萬里，愛酒者不可勝數，雖以夏禹聖帝之權力，不能引起未來以酒亡國之危懼，美國全力之禁令，難阻地窖密室之私飲，酒之魔力，可想而知矣。今日世界各國中，以美酒名世者多矣，不揣譾陋，爲加考證，世有劉伶癖者或亦引爲知己歟？</p>
<p>世界名酒　世界各國有名之酒：在印度暹邏有阿拉克（即欇子酒，內中成分約計酒精六十二％，蒸溜水三十八％），日本有荒木酒，屠蘇酒，英國有滙司克法蘭西，意大利有葡萄酒，西班牙有希歐利，葡萄牙有朴的淮蔭，荷蘭有琴酒，德國有％酒，俄國有烏屋加，奥地利有克勒麻，墨西哥有巴羅克，（龍舌蘭之汁製成）西印度諸島有勒麻，蒙古中央亞細亞，巴爾幹地方之民族，盛行乳酒。以其各種類所含之酒精成分言：椰子酒四％，琴酒五十四％，滙司克，勒麻；均在五十％內外，日本十七％，葡萄酒十三％，巴羅克酒六％，皮酒四％，馬乳酒（俄）二％，牛乳酒（巴爾幹）○·八％，烏渥加含有亞爾克爾九十五％，爲世界火酒之五，自革命後，蘇聯政府爲國民保健間題，移爲國營，酒精成分，特减低至四十％，與普通燒酒不相上下矣。</p>
<p>中國名酒　中國有名之酒，以北方之高粱，南方之紹興爲首屈一指，此外尚有五茄皮酒，虎骨木瓜酒，龍眼酒等，均爲强壯身體之普通藥酒；豆淋酒（黑豆所製）爲調整尿血瘀血之藥酒，桑椹酒（桑實製）可以聰耳明目治水腫，桑酒（桑枝與根製）可以愈脚氣，中風，菊酒以愈頭痛，紫酒（鷄糞所製）以治中風，霹靂酒（熱鐵浸入酒中）以得仙氣，名目繁多，舉不勝舉，要之以治病爲目的者，無藥不可以爲酒，無酒不可以入藥，是故健胃可用肉桂，祛痰可用桔梗，去風邪則有防風酒，活血行則有益母酒，甚至發汗用麻黄之酒，下積用大黄之酒……蓋皆以藥爲主而酒爲附者矣。（未完）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>來的時候太后雖曾在這裏很高興地遊覧了半天，但此刻一路回來，伊不是已經吩咐下無論逢到什麽站都不停嗎？於是我們便立即穿站而過，連車行的速率也不曾减低，像一頭怒馬一般的馳逐着，可是那兩旁的月台上，却已黑壓壓地跪滿了許多官員，火車在他們面前開過時，他們還一齊俯伏下來，險些把腦袋碰在地上，以表敬意；然而我們的太后呢？伊心上也何嘗不知道外面有那麽許多的人，在向伊叩頭致敬，可是伊那裏高興去理他們呢！伊簡直連對他們看一眼都不屑。</p>
<p>就像這樣車不停輪的儘是趕路，連吃飯的時候，大家也覺得非常怱促，仿彿是除掉了一心想回去以外，我們對於無論什麽事情，都没有工夫兼顧了。説來真是很可笑的，我們在平常的時候，只覺得北京的那座紫禁城刻板得，兇惡得可厭可恨，誰都巴不得想走出這個圈子去散淡散淡；而現在呢，似乎又覺得那些枯寂的宫院，幽静的殿宇，真是我們的立身安命之處，萬萬缺少不得。惟恐我們出去了十幾天，這裏頭已鬧了什麽大亂子，使我們不能再過着從前那樣的生活了；因此大家都急着要知道究竟。</p>
<p>記得上奉天去的時候，我們這一起人差不多是個個精神百倍，興緻非凡，充滿着一股旅行者所常具的朝氣；而此刻是一絲一毫都没有留剩了！（二五七）</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第九回　不善恭維求人遭叱咤未能歸去隨客惑誇張</p>
<p>我是只要有飯吃，什麽都可以呀。不想今天見着那個太太，一句話也没有説，就把我娘兒兩個，駡了出來了，我事也是不容易呵！張介夫道；我們也是這樣的替你想。你看，這位賈老爺多麽有錢，桌子上隨便就擺了這些個。若是你的姑娘，跟着這樣的人過日子，那還愁什麽吃喝穿呢？胡氏本來就覺得這位賈老爺，是銀錢多得過了額，現在介夫一提，他更動心了。便道；是呀！聽説小西天住着一個開銀子店的，那是個活財神呵！就是這位老爺嗎？張介夫道：他開的不是店，是銀行。胡氏怎麽能了解銀行這兩個字呢？就瞪了眼問道：這位老爺不是説，他家裏的大洋錢，這小西天幾十間屋子都堆不下嗎？家裏不是開銀子店，那有這些洋錢呢？張介夫道：他開的比銀子店還要大。胡氏道：那就是金子店了。賈多才只好向張介夫皺了眉道：這個問題，倒不必怎樣的跟着研究。張介夫點點頭，笑道：大嫂子，你看這屋子好嗎？胡氏兩手按了膝蓋，身子向前伸着，張嘴瞪眼睛，表示很誠懇的様子，答道：這屋子怎不好？和天宫一樣呀，怪不得呌小西天了。張介夫笑道：你説這是天宫。老實告訴你罷，賈老爺家裏的毛房，還要比這好看得多呢。胡氏道：是嗎？那還了得？月英本來是低着頭，只管聽他們談判，自己不置可否的。無如張介夫説的這句話，讓他太驚奇了，不能不抬起頭來看一下。張介夫正也向他打量着呢？便笑道：大姑娘，你或者有些不肯信嗎？月英也不便答應什麽，依然是低了頭。（一四六）</p>

<h3>無極外差機修理須知（續）</h3>
<p>— 蕭明襄</p>
<p>尖聲與狂呌</p>
<p>呌聲（像再生力收音機振盪時遇到電台所發的聲音，）常因中間週率級不能合法調整至175KC，或因高週率放大級的調整綫路，選擇性不良所致，鑒别此項障碍究屬何種病因，方法亦極簡易，先將振盪級的調整電容器接成短路，即動片與固定片相連，再將音量控制器轉至最强點，在此情形下，收音機內應寂無所聞，任何電台不能收到，如振盪器停止工作時，刻度上盤仍有幾點能聽到電台者，則可斷定此呌聲之發生，由於中間週率級調整不合法，再如振盪器停止時，雖寂無所聞，但除去振盪級電容器的短路接綫，呌聲仍然發生，則都由於高週率放大級的選擇性不足，簡單的修理方法，可將天綫改至極短，改少天綫綫圈初級的圈數，或用一極小的電容器，大約500mmf聯接在天綫引綫內意，再有許多24號真空管，雖極完好，但以之作回射電子式振盪器，往往不能，往往可使呌聲免去，極爲有效。</p>
<p>重復點</p>
<p>偶而在無極外差機內收聽某一電台音樂時，迨刻度盤轉至大約相距350KC處，此電台又復出現，補救方法第一種已見上節所述，即調整中間週率，使爲極凖確的175KC，第二種方法，應改進收音機的隔離裝置，使不能直接採取，例如機身底部邊際無隔離板者，必須裝置之，其頂部亦須罩以通地之金屬板，至於機內如綫圈電容器以及栅極頂帽接綫等件，均須一一隔離完好，當可使不致發生此種病象。</p>
<p>死點</p>
<p>無極外差機，有時在高週率一段極靈效，但旋至另一段，工作完全停止，一無所聞，此種障碍常因振盪管各極的電壓不符，以致在死點處，振盪停止所譽校準各極電壓，可救活此病，振盪器如用回射電子式（Dynatron）者，尤須注工作完善，所以最好以多數同式真空管，逐一調換試之。</p>
<p>斷續音質</p>
<p>偶而在無極外差機內，音量控制器調節至最高時，音質極佳，但若將音量稍爲减弱，聲音即變爲斷斷續續，割成粉碎，遇到此種情形時，應詳查機內各真空管，有無在應插35或51等變冪式真空管之燈座上，誤插以24號真空管，放凖各真空管的地位，可矯正此鱉弊。</p>
<h3>裝製1A6之實騐報告</h3>
<p>— 張壽毓</p>
<p>省電而能有複作用的新式真空管，業餘家誰不歡迎，因此我的兄弟三四月前買一只1A6，可是裝起來試聽的結果，不是聲息全無，便是狂呌，最多不過聽見一點成音極低的大電台播音，歷次的灰心，使他疑心買來的是壞貨，索性不裝；在上月，我同兄弟到一處來任職1A6重新翻出來，也經過六七次的改良，總算得到了成功，新式管不是容易裝的；想到了同病者的苦處，所以把實騐來報告一下。</p>
<p>現在這機成績，最遠收到河北廣播電台YGQT，及香港廣播電台ZBW，收聽上海時，五十瓦特以上都收到，（收音地點爲武進鄉下，天綫南北向，高五十餘英尺，長八十英尺，地綫不佳。）音質極淸，聲音亦響，加三十號低放一級，喇叭放音極佳，（收北平時衰落現象甚劇）每天都是如此。</p>
<p>綫路如下：</p>
<p>另件表：</p>
<p>R.F.C.,R.F.C.1=4M.H.蜂窩高阻圏。</p>
<p>R.F.C.2,R.F.C.3=普通高阻圈。</p>
<p>C.C1=.0005M.F.D.　C2=.0003M.F.D.</p>
<p>C3,C4,=.1M.F.D.　　C5=.004M.F</p>
<p>D.L1,L3,用一又四分之一吋膠管，廿六號綫繞一百二十五圈，管內在接動片的一端，塞入蜂房R.F.C.一只，由R.F.C.接出花綫一根，在綫圈接栅極的一端繞三圈，爲L,L2,這是美國最流行的高週放大交連法。</p>
<p>此機係一級高放，一級檢波；收音機中，高放最難裝，現在採用R.F.C.交連法，初學的人亦極容易收良好效果，並且各波叚發音極平均，天綫能充分發揮效力，這點予成績上極大的便利；這比用初次級綫圈交連好得多。</p>
<p>裝製1A62時，要切實注意幾點：</p>
<p>（一）1A6的栅極，應當照規定的特性，接上C電，經歷次的試騐，B電九十弗打時，C電接一個半弗打最好，能使高放能力十分高超；如接在A電負極，不接C電，聲音也有，但高放不佳。</p>
<p>（二）1A6管內各極，相距甚近，非將高週率低週率各予以良好之電路，必致互相影響而成績不佳；圖中的C3,C4,C5,R.F.C.2,R.E.C.3，就是用來解决高低週率干涉的；C　的容量大小，可以各自試騐，至收音極淸晰爲止。</p>
<p>（三）1A6簾栅極的B電壓，决不可過高，更不可高過檢波B電壓；我以前找到幾種刋物上的綫路圖，真真笑話，檢波級接四十五弗打，簾栅極接六十七個半弗打，我的兄弟數十次的失敗，就上這憑理想騙稿費人的當；我佩服申報上馬希賢先生，他的綫路圖不錯，簾栅接廿二個半弗打，我相信他是實騐家。照電的動作，電子射向陽極，如非在飽和時，則陽電壓愈高，收吸電子愈多；所以簾栅如接六十七個半弗打，而檢波接四十五弗打時，無論再生圈如何圈數多，檢波級絶對不起振盪，這一點要極注意，不要再上當。</p>
<p>（四）1A6感應極厲害，所以L1同L3，要遠離而放成直角；最好真空管及綫圈都用隔離罩；并且綫圈的隔離罩要大，綫圈徑一英寸，罩徑要三英寸；不然，罩子過緊，要吸收綫圈電能，收音很低。</p>
<p>末了，講一講收北平河北廣播電台的情形：我們環境之下，本來收北平很難，因爲我們離無錫很近；無錫的興業廣播電台，週率爲1250K,C,，而河北廣播電台週率爲1220K.B.，平時總被興業電台遮没，并且興業電台調波極闊，可惡已極；現在能够每天收到北平，不得不歸功1A6的高放，興業電台與河北相差僅三十千週，雖然同時播音時，略有點混入，還不至被擾而不能收；至於北平節目，在每日下午十時至十二時播送各戲院名角京劇，戲迷是極大歡迎的。</p>
<p>我希望同志去試騐這綫路，並實騐的改良，也來一個忠實報告。</p>
<h3>C電池代替法</h3>
<p>— 崇齡</p>
<p>在無綫電收發的放大電路裏，爲了使栅極常保持負壓以避免栅路的能力消耗，及避免真空管的放大失真起見，栅路內常插入一乾電池，以使栅壓低於絲極，得保持負壓。這種電池通常便稱爲C電池，如圖一C便是。</p>
<p>在交流機裏，爲了便利起見，僅用一個交流電源；若欲於栅路另行插入乾電池，於裝置上及應用上均覺不便。於是乎代替C電池的方法，便很有用。其法係於屏路內插入一耗阻器R與屏負極接成串聯，而將栅極與此交接點相接，如圖二所示。利用屏流經R的電壓降，於是栅極便比絲極更低，成爲負壓。R的數值須視屏流及所需栅負壓的大小而定。設栅負壓爲Ec（即所需C電池的電壓），屏路直流爲Ip、於是</p>
<p>圖二的接法，雖可得到栅負壓，但是不免要將放大效力減少，爲美中不足，因爲屏流的變化經R所生的交流電壓降，回授於栅路的原故。</p>
<p>（一）傍路法　可用一較大電容器C與R接成並聯，自成一傍路。（如圖三）C的數值常在一○兆分法拉特以上，因其對於交流所生阻甚小，屏路交流部份經此傍路流行，而不致影響耗阻R所生的栅壓。耗阻交連放大器用此法固可使放大效力不致減少，而變壓器交連放大器利用此法，有時更可增加其放大效力。</p>
<p>（二）止授法（一）於屏與陰極（即絲極）間接一電容器C1以阻止回授，如圖四所示，亦可避免放大損失；因爲這樣接法，可使流經R的屏流僅爲直流。（三）止授法（二）第三種方法，係用電容器C2與耗阻R2的串聯電路並聯於R，而栅壓由C2與R2之間接出。（如國五）其R2與C2之值與圖三之RC相若，經適當配置後，其效力且可勝於第一法</p>

<h3>變壓器斷綫後之處置</h3>
<p>— 愼</p>
<p>變壓器在使用時間過多，或繞綫時距離不均，絶緣不良，致使綫圈中斷綫，普通如用電表測知確係綫圈中斷的時候，即將所有綫圈拆去重繞，但是拆去後再重繞，其間手續費了許多，結果是爲了一根很細的綫，那實在是非常不上算的一回事情。</p>
<p>因爲拆了重繞的不上算，於是有許多人拿二百二十弗打的交流電接在綫圈的二端，通電之後，使斷綫的地方自動互相銲住，這是利用電銲的方法。可是電銲的方法，雖然亦能收效，若偶一不愼，因電壓太高的緣故，常易發生意外的危險，亦不見妥當。</p>
<p>現在祇要用十二弗打的蓄電池來代替二百二十弗打的交流電，用一隻火花綫圈，再用一只斷續開關（即瞬時開關），串接在蓄電上再用綫接通於已斷綫的綫圈上去，當斷續開關開閉的時候，不絶發生斷續的電流，約半分鐘之久，即可使已斷的綫圈自動的接銲起來，這樣接銲的方法較之用二百二十弗打交流電的更有效力，而又絲毫没有危險性，比之拆除後再重繞便利很多。</p>
<p>有時候斷的程度不很深的時候，比十二弗打再少一些的蓄電池用在上面也能收很好的效果，但是有時候斷的程度太深了的時候，至多用十八個弗打的蓄電池一定能收效。</p>
<p>如果用十八個弗打蓄電池，依照上法而不能銲接，不必用再高的電壓，已無法挽救，祇有拆去了再繞一次的方法了。</p>

<h3>關於題材的選擇與批評的責任</h3>
<p>— 辛人</p>
<p>藝術的題材是多樣性的，因爲作爲這些題材的源泉的現實，是複雜的多歧的，牠的發展是曲綫的。一個才能的創作者，必然地是以綜合的形式，多樣的題材，去體現現實的真實。</p>
<p>然而，在一定的時代和社會，由於生産力發展階段的不同，便形成了一定的社會關係。這關係是極端複雜，並且常常是不能「淸一色」的。因此，作家在面對着這萬花撩亂的現實時，就發生了「題材的選擇」的問題。</p>
<p>題材選擇的必要，現在是誰都不會否認的吧。因爲在事實上，不論那一種作家，甚至那種煩瑣的經騐主義的作者——他們專門描寫「身邊瑣事」——都有「題材的選擇」的。日本現今的通俗小説家菊池寛，誰都曉得他的濫産繁作，「隨便什麽事情」都收進小説裏去。可是，倘若我們仔細一看，菊池寛作品的題材，其實都有一定的範圍，一定的挑選。他的近作「貞揁問答」攝成上下兩部的影片，哄動了一部分小市民，正是因爲他「選擇」了這個「不安時代」中小市民的落後的墮落的部分之類型的生活，再用他那違背現實的意識，形式的技巧，加以表現的緣故。</p>
<p>每個作家，誰都知道題材實有選擇之必要，然而由於社會集團意識的不同，由於才能的差别，這選擇便顯得複雜和困難。也正是因此之故，這問題才需要我們最大的注意。</p>
<p>最近才看到了關於這問題的一點小論爭，那起因是由於對於雜誌「東流」創刋號的批評。看到討論，題材選擇的必要是被承認了；因爲倘若作家和批評家都必須問：「這是不是一個題材？」便是表示他們都非有題材的選擇不可了。所以，這裏的問題是應該怎樣去選擇。</p>
<p>上面説過，一定的時代，社會，存在着一定的社會關係——典型的境遇。比方，文藝復興期的英國，那商業資本主義的文化，是有下面這四種特質的：第一，個人主義；第二，國民主義；第三，王政主義；第四，帝國主義。這種特質，就是那時候的英國社會之典型的境遇。偉大的詩人和劇作家的莎士比亞，在其諸作品中都體現着這種典型的境遇，社會的特徵。</p>
<p>可是莎士比亞倘若到這裏便停止了的話，他是不會成爲偉大的藝術家吧。他是通過這些典型的境遇，進而表現出基於典型的諸境遇而形成的典型的諸性格的。正如V.M.Friche所分析的一樣，莎氏在其諸作品裏，把一切的典型的性格，都藝術地表現了。表現在「羅密歐與朱麗葉」（Romeo　and　Jullet）中的戀愛，表現在「奥世洛」（Othello）中的嫉妬，表現在「麥克倍斯」（Macbeth）中的名譽心，表現在「哈姆雷特」中的優柔不斷……都是表示商業資本時代的個人主義的注重。又如表現在「享利第四」（King　Henry　IV）「李加特二世」（King　Richard　II）諸作中的祖國愛護和異國民的輕蔑，是當時的國民主義精神的反映。此外在Jnlivs　Caesar中所表現的君主政治的精神，在Tempest中所表現的開拓荒島的精神，都是當時的王政主義與帝國主義的社會要求的表現。莎士比亞將這些典型的東西，在社會的發展過程中體現出來，例如鄙吝商人Shylock的典型，没落貴族Antonio的典型，以及這兩方的鬥爭的過程等等。</p>
<p>從莎士比亞的例，我們窺到了一個偉大作家的「創作的秘密」。這秘密是什麽呢？就是凡偉大的藝術作品，都是通過一定時代的社會的境遇，表現出一定的典型的性格的。</p>
<p>道問題倘能好好的理解，那末，所謂題材的選擇的問題，也就迎刃而解决了。凡現實主義的作家，都得在現實裏「選擇」題材，這題材必需最能表現這時代的典型的境遇與典型的性格。在這裏也許會發生一個疑問：我們一方面説凡題材必須是典型的境遇與性格的，一方面，我們又常常説起題材的多樣性（因爲提供題材的現實是複雜多歧的，是曲綫的地發展的），這不是矛盾麽？是的，一點也不會矛盾，請看莎士比亞和巴爾札克的題材的多樣性和那典型的諸事物之統一性，就會瞭然的吧。要是現在的作家因求「典型」而趨於公式主義化，那是作者認識現實的概念化所致。</p>
<p>在上面提過的關於「東流」創刋號的批評的爭論中，主要的是爲了以「兒童心理」爲題材的小説「好調伯」。作者凡海君在那篇小説裏把題材限界在片面的描寫上，所在其中没「力」的要素，只有人道的悲哀的要素存在。這題材被指爲没有多大意義，就是説，作者以那種態度所處理成的題材，没有抓到時代的本質的方面。可是有人以爲干涉作家的選擇題材並不是批評家的責任，認爲這種指摘是文壇上的「嬰兒殺戮」現象，並且以爲批評家必需以同樣的眼光來對付一切的題材。這意見，倘若理解了上述的題材選擇的必要，倘若承認批評者的責任，正是在恊力作家深入現實，表現現實的真實，便可以見得是錯誤的。我在這裏可以把熟知的一個消息獻於空受「嬰兒殺戮」的幻影之虚驚的人——「嬰兒」非但未被殺戮，而且正在向往健康之路上成長。</p>
<h3>裝水的車</h3>
<p>— 沈聖時</p>
<p>默然地，一個兒坐在山崗的小樓上面，聽裝水的小車子咿啞咿呀地從遠處的田塍上推過去，車輪輾出凄厲的聲音：一輛車推過之後，接着第二輛的車輪聲，又咿啞咿呀地飄過來了。</p>
<p>看着裝水的小車子，我懷念起水鄉的江南的家鄉了。</p>
<p>在家鄉，江南的吳縣，我是從來没機會看到過裝水的小車子的；江南是美麗的水鄉呵！記起明朝唐伯虎的姑蘇雜詠詩：「市河到處堪摇櫓，街巷通宵不絶人」，「趕早市都淸早起，遊山船直到山邊」，要在春天，暖暖陽光浸透的河岸上，綠楊樹下，你帶着你年輕的弟弟妹妹，到河岸邊去，看淸綠的河水，水上皺着微微的波紋，有一片兩片偶然而被微風摇落下的嫩黄的柳葉，浮在水面上，隨微波輕輕地流過去，流過去；船過，河水擁起深渦的笑痕，莫怪我們的詩人要唱着「江南人盡似神仙」了。</p>
<p>春天又回來了，在遥遠的客地，我懷念起林擒色的水鄉的江南，我愛看春水船影，家鄉是聽不到裝水車的凄厲的聲音的。</p>
<p>這里的地方，三面環圍着山，淮河渦河是唯有的水道。城內没一條市河，你跑上街去，盡是凹凸不平的石路，也找不到一條橋，因爲没有水，這地方就缺少這一種建築了。</p>
<p>街上也成天不斷的推行着裝水的小車子；我們吃的水，全是從山上裝下來的泉水，山泉是這里唯一的水量的供給。</p>
<p>再告訴你那些推水車的人，是很費力可憐的，這些苦力，是終身靠這推水車子生活的。</p>
<p>車是獨個兒推的木輪車，車上裝兩大桶子水；一條十分堅厚的布帶子楞住在頭頸上面，帶子的兩端繫住在車槓上邊，然而手再把着兩條車槓用力向前推：想吧！只説頸部他要楞得多少力，這是多吃苦的工作呵！</p>
<p>那些推裝水車的苦力，每天吃最粗劣的麵綍，得一個微數的報酬，他們是要永恒地這樣繼續着做這工作，纔能解决他們每日的吃的問題。</p>
<h3>蘭都不拉拔路上</h3>
<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>從班哖對岸的碼頭開始，道路是全用泥土築成的。因爲國道的修理還没　　到這個地方，（荷蘭政府是最會控制她的國庫的。如果一個地方還没有發展至某種程度，她是不肯輕易地把一道馬路塗起柏油來的。）所以雨後的洞穴和車輪的轍跡便在太陽下化成堅硬的傷痕：而汽車便在面摇擺顛簸起來，使客人亨受一種苦痛。</p>
<p>一直到隣近萬叻榴槤的地方，才有柏油馬路。旅客們於長途顛簸之後，才舒服地透了一口氣。</p>
<p>時時在森林間碰到交通警察的關卡，車子便慢慢地行駛起來，直至停止。待警察點騐了載客的人數和車行的速率之後，車夫又常常超出法定的速率猛駛起來。偶然碰到有疑問的時候，車中的客人便應該一一備受審問，延慢了一點時間，然後才把紅旗揮起來，指示車子的前進。——這些動作是爲了連逃客和非法的子民而設的。</p>
<p>漸漸地貼近蘭都不拉拔了，於是蘇門答臘中部的丘陵地帶便在旅途上出現。車子便漸漸在道途上起起伏伏起來。</p>
<p>在一道鐵橋上，兩端正是一個廣大的斜坡。車子在一端的斜坡上爬土，一達到鐵橋的頂點，車子又慢慢地滑下去了。</p>
<p>橋下正有潺潺的暗紅色的河水在流着。夕陽照在四野，從頂端的鐵橋上望下去，四面的樹梢正被陽光所輝耀，幻成了金黄色，浮現在一片暗綠的上面。</p>
<p>突然一陣汽車的笛聲把我喚醒來。我望着前面，四五個孟加拉人正以雄壯的偉軀，載着重幾百斤的印度布匹，駕着脚踏車，同時從橋上勇猛地滑下去。</p>
<p>孟加拉人載布匹騎脚踏車的技術是很爲高强的。你看他連人帶物，重至五六百斤，却能够控制車子的重心，在丘陵間毫無掛碍地爬上和爬下，用着很多點鐘在森林道中奔馳起來，没有顯出困倦的樣子。</p>
<p>却又出乎意外地從前面的孟加拉人的伴侣中突然發出個尖叫，一個人連車子給翻進馬路勞邊的溝道里去了。於是一羣的孟加拉人趕忙停下了車子，——那車子已經滑過去很遠了——從高深的溝道中把他們的伴侣慢慢扶起來。（未完）</p>
<h3>樂以忘憂</h3>
<p>— 臧克家</p>
<p>近一二年來有一個現象，要是你是個有心人静觀起來，有種説不出的味。這就是一些新的東西變成了舊的而一些舊的東西確又變成了新的。</p>
<p>自從改用新曆以來，純粹的舊曆書是不多見了，然而日曆中却又添了第三種——陰陽合曆，中國人向來是喜歡「中庸」，這也算是「允執厥中」的一種表現。老實説就是舊曆書絶跡於人間，不過舊曆的季節也抹糊不了，因爲鄉間的人心上至今還認新曆是洋鬼子東西，舊曆雖然離開了他們的眼，然而却跑上了他們的心他們的指頭，舊的習慣和心理大約不大容易打倒，鄉下至今春聯還有寫「天子萬年」的，那是愚民無知不必苛責，不見高呼打倒迷信，還一樣有不愚的人用祈禱的方法求天求神嗎？</p>
<p>舊曆年不放假表示了「新」，然而舊曆年却不能不過，如是乎「假」還是放的，不過換了一個名辭。官民同樂幾天，大家嘗一嘗舊年的實會。過了舊年第一個勝日，自然是元宵節嘍，也用不到先查新日歷上的「望」字，大家都早已凖備着了。在各大都市裏聽説都開了烟火的禁令呌民衆們暢快幾夜，好造成一種昇平的空氣。古時上元節夜遊不禁，「與民同樂」是古今同然的，去年元宵是在青島過的，呌鞭砲聒噪得一夜没睡好。怕被人羣擠到海裏去，只到中山路頭探了探頭便被如山似海的人影人聲嚇回去了。没想到今年的元宵會跑到這個縣城裏來過。早聽説這裏的人好熱鬧，特向大都市裏花了幾百塊錢訂的烟火。自己生在個破小鄉村裏從没開過眼。</p>
<p>這回决心要見識見識。十三日下午進德會裏人就像百川會海一般湧來了，飛塵廹得白日無光。徒歩的，乘車的，騎馬的，老的，少的，村的，俏的，看罷，雜色混成的這一團！第二天更熱鬧，街市頂上的蓆棚好似降低了的青天，家家門口的紗燈好似月亮好似星。燈，不同的式樣稱着不同的彩筆繪成的連環故事，浪漫的，神怪的。人不許在街衕子裏站住脚，身子被擠得浮在半空。夕照一刻一刻的消滅，人一刻一刻的興致起來。小孩打一個燈，蓮花燈，車子燈，飛機燈…，死掣住大人的衣角在人縫裏穿，一些成隊的女孩子被擠得喳喳的呌。天空中火箭亂飛，地面上一片燈光映着一片朦朧的影。這時天上的星月没了光輝，人心裏另有了一個天地。花放過了，有飛機，有凉亭，凉亭裏還炸出了個女人，有…有我不會説的一些花樣。在没見過世面的我的眼中這真算了不起的神妙了，而歸途中還聽到人羣裏發出不滿的怨聲來。這一晚幸而掙扎着没有被擠到河裏去，回來累了一身汗。</p>
<p>所以那晚雖是聽説還更熱鬧，然而也不敢再衝鋒了。只好埋在這寂静的小屋中，任外邊嘈雜的聲音振得窗紙響。</p>
<p>「好了創疤忘了痛」，這是形容人好忘事的。在創痛之中能忘了痛尋一點開心，這種精神惟有中國「樂以忘憂」的民族才有。元宵節更把這種精神表現到最充分的地歩！</p>
<h3>嚮晚（十一）</h3>
<p>— 屈軼</p>
<p>「中國學校總是那一套」，新文學家長瘦子，覺得這一問題，倒是他做文章的絶好材料。便冒了這一句總頭，預備來感慨系之地論一下。「我在日本。我在日本—就全不是那個。中國學校裏，也是黨黨派派的。你不對，我打倒你，我來做！中國學校裏教員，全欠缺些國民觀。那個—那個，國民之觀呀！……」</p>
<p>「那麽你倆總該是一派了哪！你倆？」胡一元漫然地問一聲。腦子却又向别的方向活動起來。「可惜我没打着彩票。—真是太那個媽媽的了。娘舅！你想是不是？要是那一次，那一次，咱們和那批人講妥了條件，讓咱們來發行一種水災奬劵……噯噯！實際上，不説那次也可以，前二禮拜，我到河南去，要是這件事包定了，也就行啦！就地軍政界全不成問題，偏是河南那面—唉！總商會也太作難了。總商會—可是這個東西真不差。紙要米粒似的一粒，放在香烟上，一抽，便會通體舒暢了，通體呀—通而體之舒暢了……」</p>
<p>「唔唔！」大肚子娘舅這回沉下臉，做一種肯定的回答。「現在真是非講點出路不可。便是我銀樓，唉，討厭之至！水災之後，還來一個一二八！雖則不曾一二八到這個地面，可是總店倒了楣，可是，唉唉！……」</p>
<p>大肚子娘舅和鵝蛋臉外甥，於是又像「酒逢知己」似的大談其生意經起來。但誰也不相信，這樣景氣的大肚子娘舅，却有那麽一大担子不景氣的憂愁。</p>
<p>那位新文學家，對於這一段談話雖然覺得有點渺茫，但平時却也頗頗研究國民政治經濟學；便也挽入來説：</p>
<p>「真是天災人禍！真是天災人禍。實際上，日本爲其本國打算實無發動一二八的必要！老李你看對不對。」説着，好像恐怕冷落了坐在一邊的伴當，又回過頭向李安打一個招呼。</p>
<p>可是李安却祗一味地笑，微微地點着頭，並不參加這有關國計民生的討論。</p>
<p>「不過！」但胡一元却回過頭去，想給新文學家底話轉了一轉向，便自己一屁股仰倒長沙發上坐去；而大肚子也同時退坐到床邊上去。</p>
<p>「不過！」胡一元再「不過」了一下。可是想不起應如何接下去，但在招待朋友那個意義，他又有話説了。「不過你們歡喜抽這個嗎？」説着又把大姆指和小指伸成一直綫，作成一枝烟槍的樣子，同時，還把大姆指尖頭接在嘴邊。</p>
<p>「不，不！」郭仁立刻摇起頭來。「這是有喪國民元氣的。使不得！使不得！我在日本時候，就！」</p>
<p>「那麽，咱們開飯上來吧！」胡一元於是又挺有精神地鶻落站起，按了按電鈴。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>三老新婚</h3>
<p>— 乙</p>
<p>真是新聞年年有，今年隔外多，近來有幾位老頭兒，空房難守，不甘寂寞，大討其家主婆，倒也是民國史上的一件風流佳話。</p>
<p>自熊鳳凰和毛彦文結婚後，一般老頭兒均躍躍欲試，大喊其我也來一套，情願做一個割鬚棄袍的曹阿瞞。因此遜淸翰林而曾爲湖北議員的張海若先生，前日在北平西長安街大陸春，和楊嗣馨女士結婚，女士擅長文學，能撫琴品簫，現年三十三歳，恰與熊夫人同賡，真是無獨有偶。</p>
<p>據二十七日報載，前蘇浙皖廵閲使齊爕元，亦定於三月三日，和天津名書家華世奎之長女結婚，齊年五十有六，華女士年四十有一，年齡還算相若，老夫老妻，可謂天作之合。故在此一二個月中，而老頭兒做新倌人的，已發生三件事實，真是妙不可醬油。</p>
<p>我嘗見隨園詩話中，有某老先生，新納一位如花似玉的如夫人，樂不可支，因吟詩兩句道，「我已如舟將出世，得君來作掛颿人。」此老姓甚名誰，我已忘却，因爲其詩殊妙，故尚能記憶，不過此老既經有此悟道之言，或不致一帆風順，揚長而去，但於情不自禁時，前途風波，恐亦不暇顧到矣。</p>
<p>老頭兒討娘子，從前原不大見有這樣一回事，現在因爲被法律所束縛，只准討大，不准討小，於是花樣翻新，老頭子也只好做起新倌人。這並不是從前的老頭子有志氣，現在的老頭子無志氣，此種現象，全是環境造成，所可惜的，五綹長髯，盡付并刀剪去，真是兒女情長，能使英雄氣短。</p>
<p>現在女界高唱男女平權，但無論其平到如何地歩，惟此一點，女子總有些兒吃虧，只看見五六十歳老頭子去討娘子，而並不見有五六十歳老太婆去嫁人，危文繡和王某結婚，危的年齡尚不到五六十歳，但已飽受社會上的攻擊，但危係黎大總統之妾，故嫁作商人之婦，在王某或别有用意也。否則恐亦不敢問津矣。</p>
<h3>一個十五年前的鄰居</h3>
<p>— 不揚</p>
<p>那還是十五年前的事。</p>
<p>爲着讀書上的便利起見，我家搬到Ｌ鎭上去住了。隔壁是：一對中年夫妻的住宅，女的短短的身段，從一切舉動上十足地表現着遜淸末葉的村婦。男的是三里外一家醬園裏的夥計，長長的士布袍子上老是罩着一條藍的竹裙，一副櫃台上應用的小商人的臉永遠微笑着，很容易討小孩們的歡喜。</p>
<p>那時，我也是小孩中的一個，我也和别人一樣愛看他的笑臉。</p>
<p>他也相當地就受大人們的歡迎，在我父親面前總是執着下屬的儀式，父親也不時稱讚他的好處。爲着Ｌ鎭太偏僻了，父親寄來的信十九是呌他的店裏轉遞。每隔四五天，他總回來一趟，倘然我家有信的話，那末，他先脱去營業上應用的藍布竹裙，把長衣整理一下再到我的家來。他是多麽熱望着脱去身上的竹裙換上一件馬褂呀！也許他把這個希望放在我父親的身上了？</p>
<p>可是收入並没十分多担負却十分重的父親，被環境牽制着，使他失望了。</p>
<p>這不過是現在的追憶呢？小孩的腦袋裏是不會想到這些的，我還是愛和他玩，着他講三五天裏街上的新聞呢。記得有一天他講完新聞之後，要我到他家裏去睡，可是我不肯，後來他拿出幾個漢口的大銅板哄我，　答應了。</p>
<p>他家裏的一切都　還整齊，不過他的年齡比我家大些吧了</p>
<p>這樣，我們怪和睦地做三年鄰居。爲着環境關係，我們第二次的搬了家。</p>
<p>十五年前悠久的歳月，把我塑成一個大人了，從學校到社會，爲着自身的生活忙碌着，一直没有和他見過面。</p>
<p>在一個賬務悾惚的下午，同事王君告訴我：有一個衣衫襤褸的人要看我。可是當我見到的時候，我怔住了。瘦削而又蒼老的面龐，在我遲鈍的記憶裏再想不起是誰？</p>
<p>「你不認識我了吧？我是阿紹，和你在Ｌ鎭上鄰居過的」。</p>
<p>看我的眼光儘在他的面上打量，他漸愧地，口切地，自己介紹着自己。同時，他也用畏怯的目光望着我，倘然是在路上的話，我相信他也不認識我的。</p>
<p>倒了一杯茶，默默地大家給悠久的距離生疏着。</p>
<p>過只四十開外的人，可是他的面上十足表明着是一個年逾花甲的老翁了。眼眶深深地陷進着容得下兩個鴿蛋，顴骨高聳着，上下牙疏落得可憐，本來會講動聽的故事的嘴，現在扁扁的像個老太婆。身上並没穿着馬褂，就是原有長衫外罩條竹裙的裝束都維持不下，他穿的只是一套藍布的短衫褲，雖只現在還是料峭的春天。</p>
<p>顯然的，十五年的歳月，把他的生活大大地改變了。</p>
<p>終於——他開口了，一副老太婆似的嘴掀動着，他告訴我：在醬園裏失了業，一直間在家裏没有出路，現在真蕩不住了，想到上海來謀謀事，却巧朋友處有個飯司的缺子，　足　命不　　　月底，可領到，所以向你——暫時扣幾塊。</p>
<p>恐怕我拒絶他的要求，兩隻灰黄的眼睛緊緊地釘着我的上下唇。</p>
<p>他的别後生活我不知道，不過從兒時的好感上我得相信他的話是對的；何况他的慾望並不大，於是我毫不猶疑地答應他，還送他到門口。</p>
<p>又是一星期的間隔。</p>
<p>在會客室裏我第二次碰到他，他身上還是這們的一套。他告訴我；前趟飯司的缺子是代理的，現在那個人出來了</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>，又找不到第二個職業，上海也蕩不住，預備轉去，希望我能够再帮他一次忙。</p>
<p>他還説：我自己真不好意思向你開口，可是除了你，上海再找不到一個可以借錢的人。</p>
<p>我自己的收入真也菲薄得可憐，妻子還吵着要買一隻摩登些的手提篋，可是眼前的情景使我感動，援助一個流落他鄉的人回去不是比替妻子買裝式品更好嗎？於是，我第二次帮他的忙。</p>
<p>他走！我心裏得快活，像盡了一項人類應盡的任務。</p>
<p>一個月時間又悄悄地從日曆上溜走了。</p>
<p>出人意料地第三次我見到他，像一項已完成的任務給破壞了一樣，我開始惱怒了。我責罰他不該在一個帮你忙的人前説謊，可是禁不住他的哀求，我終於透支了下月份的薪金給他。</p>
<p>第二天，一個同事看見他還在街頭流浪着。</p>
<h3>馿</h3>
<p>— 華木</p>
<p>據説馿性很愚懦。但究竟愚懦到怎樣的程度，我從來很少涉獵動物學一類的書，可很糢糊的。不過記得七歳時祖父教我讀的一本什麽國文讀本上，就讀到一課馿蒙虎皮的寓言，説是馿羡慕虎威，有一天把虎披在身上，出去欺嚇羣獸，忽然聽到山後虎吼，急忙棄皮而逃。下面還繪着一個圖。那時覺得馿倒是很聰明有趣的東西。時時都想，幾時自己也有一隻馿把來騎騎玩玩。但是，故鄉是没有馿的，不單没人養馿，馿是什麽東西都少人知道。因此常常想起，心頭總是悵惘若失。</p>
<p>之後，年事漸長，稍能閲讀古人詩文，又每每發現古人對於馿也是非常愛好的，凡尋芳採勝，都不會少一隻馿來代歩。尤其是陸放翁的「細雨騎馿入劍門」句，覺得詩情畫意，躍然欲出。對於馿，自然又更感興趣了。</p>
<p>來上海後，以爲總可以看到馿了。當初祖父就説過江南也是很多馿的。但終歸使我失望；馬路上不單看不到馿的踪影，即騎馬的都很不容易看見。因此，我的希望就轉而寄托到蘇州去，心下常想，在春天烟雨中騎着馿探虎邱，遊天平，興趣都够詩化的。所以每當草長鶯飛的春天來到人間，就會喚起我濃郁的蘇遊宿念。</p>
<p>這個美麗的憧憬，一直做了四年，在我自然是很覺得抱憾的。不意這次南京之行，居然得在下關第一次看到想念了十餘年的馿。</p>
<p>可是，一向對馿的興趣，好感，也就給打碎得乾乾净净。</p>
<p>馿，原來真個是呆笨，猥瑣尴尬的東西！聽到牠的鳴聲就會心悸，這麽哀，這麽慘澀，無力，怯懦。短倭不配的驅體，跑起來蹣蹣跚跚的。難怪其只可背負粗重物件，比不得馬的駿逸，能够馳騁疆塲了。</p>
<p>馿的時代是過去了。我再也不會想到騎馿採勝是一番風雅韻事。因爲我到底不是古人呀。</p>
<h3>陋巷歌聲</h3>
<p>— 斯全</p>
<p>拖着遲笨的歩子踏進自家的院子，金黄的陽光從迎面高牆上反映到眼前的時候，一如無數條的金蛇在我腦海里擁擠着。妻説過的永遠不見太陽的動物，今天在我面前開展另一個局面了，然而這局面同樣像落日的餘暉一般已是壽命終止的時候了。</p>
<p>妻迎面出來，在不預料中感到我那種沮喪的樣子把她無邪的玩笑從唇邊咽回去了。我們結婚兩年，生活在歡樂中過去，今天這類的壓廹到我們肩頭來還是初次的經騐呢。</p>
<p>在房中坐定，一塊三角形的陽光還掛在牆頭，這時候我不得不是個宿命論者了。通常每年有幾天的休假，迎着初升的太陽起身的時候，妻總是輪着指頭計算，她對於我不見太陽的生活也感得興趣，不過以爲我們常做客似的太少有談笑的機會，所以對於幾天的休假，真是不肯浪費每一個鐘點的過去。如果今天是個難得的不預料的放工日子，今天的晚上我們不知有怎樣一個歡樂的聚會呢。妻常常希望我調換一個工作，你對於現在的情形能够不説是命運嗎？</p>
<p>太陽漸漸西沉，高牆上已是一片鉛灰的時候了。我的工作塲所不是剛開始勞動？我隱隱聽見生之呼號！我們兩個就静坐在房里直到瞧不淸對方的臉。妻終於在壓廹不過的空氣中燃亮了電燈，用最温柔底細聲問我感得不舒服嗎？</p>
<p>我注視着她的臉，她的驚惶的瞳孔中已貯積將難忍的淸淚，她自己明知着有一個驚人的消息傳來而强自鎭定着，我們的歡樂日子就這樣地結果了嗎？我問着自己，想用最大的聲音喊一聲「我失業了」！把我快要爆炸的心臟安定牠的脈搏。</p>
<p>巷口傳來了尖俏的歌聲，一個凄痛的影像立刻劃在我的眼前，那個彷彿小姑娘黄鶯般的歌聲是一個頭髮快班白的老者用假嗓子逼出來的呵！大概他和我同一命運，在日落的時候開始也的生活。有一天，一個難得的不預料的放工日子啊，在我們剖着雪梨分食的時候，聽見了淸脆的歌聲，妻曾笑着問我，「這小姑娘有多大年紀了」？我敏感地猜了，怎知道是個半百開外的老頭兒呢。我也曾慷慨地賜了他我一天的工資，他不絶地稱謝，那時我覺得自己太偉大！</p>
<p>如今那個老頭兒依舊用他的假嗓子生活着，而我粗壯的一個青年人却被失業的恐怖壓廹着，你能不信命運嗎？從明天起，那個老頭兒恐怕要來扣我的門，賜給我他用假嗓子換來的一支歌唱的代價呢！</p>
<p>「我能够每天見太陽了」！我不能不大聲的喊，我將要不能呼吸了。</p>
<h3>澡堂</h3>
<p>— 覺夫</p>
<p>故都雜寫</p>
<p>故都的澡堂，我以爲是一個消磨時間的最好處所。不管是誰，他只要走進裏面去細細地體味一二回，留心看看光身赤體的顧客仰的怡然自適的神情，總會覺到時間這東西，在那裏原是值不得什麽的。</p>
<p>澡堂裏面的設備和招待，説來也委實是使得人欽服；在那一個廣敞的廳堂裏，很整齊地排列着好幾十張臥榻，榻上鋪着潔白的被褥，中間置着一張矮小精緻的茶几。廳的一邊是理髮處，一邊是浴室。你一進去，就有人引你到一張榻前，爲你解開衣服，泡一壺淸新的茶放在几上。洗完澡後，就有人獻上毛巾來給你擦背抹面，倒一杯淸茶放在你的面前。要走時，就有人爲你擦鞋，穿衣服和向你道幾聲客套話。</p>
<p>如果你是覺得日子難打發過去，才走進澡堂來的，那最好多邀一位朋友同進去。於解脱衣服後，可不必那麽快就入盆，可以隨便在榻上躺下來，拿起當天的報紙，一篇一篇地看下去，報紙看得膩煩了，就坐起來，抽抽烟，喝喝茶，和朋孔友亂談閒天；如是這樣還不能盡興，花一二毛錢，呌夥計到外面買幾兩白乾，一些花生瓜子之類，來爲談助，就倍覺有趣了。於酒喝够，瓜子花生吃完之後，這時就可呌夥計打水入浴了。洗完澡後，如覺時間尚早，不妨披上毛巾，再在榻上躺下來，爽性睡個痛快。及至醒來時，穿好衣服，付完二毛錢的賬，緩歩行出外面看夫，一天的時光，已於不知不覺間過去了。</p>
<p>前時在廣州，看見人家只花個三四毛錢，租一二份報紙，叫一壺茶，一碟瓜子，三二碟點心，便能痛痛快快地度過一天，我總以爲這是打發日子的最便宜而且舒服的辦法了；而今看來，仍覺比故都的澡堂遜色一籌！</p>
<h3>短文</h3>
<p>— 林峯</p>
<p>早晨，大概離朝陽抹紅了樹梢還遠，夜來的霧，還没有退盡，窗外，掀開窗簾看時，還是迷迷糊糊的；一些晨犬的吠聲聽去還覺得是在夜裏，天是一片白，没有紅色的雲爪，灰沉的。在早晨的淸冷氣中，人們都還睡着。</p>
<p>噹啷—噹啷—那是駝鈴，在胡同裏響了。那麽一個穩捷的大動物，又走上一日之程了。</p>
<p>秋郊，「低空有斷雲，」一個大營房遠看去是灰的，營房後面有許多殘碎的墓。時有軍號聲在斷雲下震蕩；秋風送來的馬嘶聲，更是激厲。</p>
<p>我在那些墓道裏走，在一座快平了的墓旁，我發現了一根長樁，上有快要剝盡了的字：「一等兵某某病故葬此。」旁邊還寫着他故鄉的名字。</p>
<p>是邊城的夕照，破碎的城頭，有軍號聲從那裏蕩起，一陣風猛可地掃上城頭去，吹號的人，在灰塵裏不見了，但號聲却更悽厲。</p>
<p>一隊兵蹈着夕照，在號聲裏迎着風遠了。</p>

<h3>形形色色的明星們背誦對白的方法（下）</h3>
<p>— 蜜薺</p>
<p>如果你看見了意大利滑稽家亨利亞美達的片子，以爲他有趣的話，你還没有看見他背誦對白時的形狀呢。他先要怒馬似的奔跑着，然後跑得慢些，漸漸慢到像平常走路一樣。在那個時候，他就開始背誦他的對白。他時時伸着自己的巨靈之掌，猛然地向他的頭上用力拍着，如同要將對白的字句，拍進他的腦筋一樣，但是那劈拍的聲音，却十分可怕，旁邊的人聽見了、一定以爲他要尋死哩。</p>
<p>惠爾羅吉士到底是個老資格。他事前從來不預先背誦對白的。等到他到了攝影塲上，片子還没有開拍之前，他就大模大樣的問道：「今天拍的是什麽？」導演告訴了他，他於是將脚本打了開來，讀了一遍兩遍，然後就開始登塲了。但是他天份極高，對白中有不自然，不確當的地方，他就自動更改了並不用先和導演商量。等到一個拍完了，常常裏面的對白，和原有的詞句完全不同了，但是總比原有的詞句好些。當然，惠爾羅吉士是個例外，不是普通的演員所能倣摩的。</p>
<p>但是還有一個鼎鼎大名的演員，和惠爾羅吉士可以頡頏齊名的，他的行徑亦和惠爾羅吉士不相上下。他就是華雷士皮萊。他從來記不住對白的，因爲他的記憶大壞，所以就索性不去白費那份心思了。他在開拍片子之前，先將對白的詞句，大概看了一看，記取了一個大意。這樣，他就可登塲了。他在拍戲的時候，他可以「隨便」杜撰。可是他杜撰的詞句，都是極爲通順流利，絶無牽强不自然的毛病。</p>
<p>勞爾夫貝拉梅的記憶是極快的。許多演員，像詹梅賈克南，瑪格麗蘇萊文，加雷古柏，瑙瑪希拉，亞倫海爾，喬治賴甫脱，約翰巴爾斯等，都可以列入記憶迅速的一類的。勞爾夫貝拉梅先將脚本通篇看了一遍，然後每次讀十頁。他因爲舞台上的經騐極深，所以祗要連讀三四遍，就不會忘記了。這種能力，在戲劇界是不算什麽稀奇的，因爲許多舞台演員，祇要將全篇劇本讀過幾遍，就會背誦得從頭至尾，一字不錯的。</p>
<p>梅蕙絲祇有一個地方，可以背誦對白，那就是她的楊妃榻上。就是到了攝影塲上，對白臨時要加减的時候，如果是重要的話，她亦一定要退到她的化妝室裏，躺在她的楊妃榻上，將新改的對白重新背誦不可。她説惟有在一個鬆軟的榻上，全身才可以弛放，然後圍上了眼，將詞句印入她的腦筋。</p>
<p>琴慕爾和阿麗絲費，都是要對着一人長的大鏡子，練習她們的説白的。琴慕爾最注重的是她身體的姿勢。她一定要左右旋轉着，尋找到了一個最適當的部位爲止。阿麗絲費最注意的，是她口部的動態。當她説話的時候，她作着各種的面部表情，以求到最自然的表情爲止。</p>
<p>蕭麗鄧波兒的對白，是她的母親教給她的。每天晚上，她的母親將明天的對白，當作一段故事似的讀給她聽叫她跟着讀一遍又一遍，直到她自己會説了，然後才去睡覺。明天早晨到攝影塲去之前，她的母親再叫她説一遍。可是她將來很少説差過一個字音。凡是小明星，如珂拉蘇高林斯和培培琪恩，都是由她們的母親教她們的。但是她們的記憶極强，許多成人還及不到她們哩。</p>
<p>曼麗特蘭漱死去之後，獨歩影台的老皇后梅勞勃森，她的記憶力幾乎數形狀，以及她的對白的部位，長短字眼，這樣，那一頁的對白就已經攝入她的眼簾了。她可以接連攝許多頁，上台後一字不忘，因爲她可以從心裏「看見」每頁上的一個一個字的！</p>
<p>格倫達福舊喜歡高聲誦讀她的對白，這樣她可以聽到自己的聲音，辦到正確與否。她每夜練習明天的對白，直到她自己覺得不能再進歩了，然後忘記一切。等到片子開拍之前，她再拿出脚本來看一遍。</p>
<p>琪恩哈羅是事事周到的。她將脚本要細細讀到十五遍之多。但她並不用心去記憶，但使詞句由熟讀後自然印入腦筋之中。華納巴克斯德亦是時時演習，以求至美至善的。華倫威廉的手中，時時拿着脚本，不論開車，吃飯，遊戲，或走路的時候。</p>
<p>總而言之，每人有各人的特别的習慣。每個人用他或她特别的方法，去牢牢記住他所應當背誦的對白，我行我是，不管旁人的看了好笑。這就是好萊塢形形色色的一斑。（完）</p>

<h3>評「舊約新盟」</h3>
<p>— 尤兢</p>
<p>Forsaking　All　Others</p>
<p>南京映</p>
<p>首先我想説及開映在「舊約新盟」之前的顔色卡通片「Disconlented　Canary」</p>
<p>不滿於囚籠生活的金絲雀飛回自由的天空中之後，在無限歡樂中首先就見厄於兇殘的黑貓：餓了學着蜂子吸花蜜被蜂刺傷：冷了跟着鴿子歸巢又遭拒絶：於是在狂風暴雨中被雷電震動得失了棲止的地方，又受黑貓的欺侮，幾乎失了性命，最後踉蹌地奔回了囚籠。這時主人屋內的火爐正熊煎地燒着。鄰家的鸚鵡在架上吞着主人抛來的食料，一邊説：「呵，你…」。</p>
<p>這古老的，説教的寓言，由製作者用電影藝術的技巧，鮮美的顔色，「圓熟的手法」博得多少觀衆領悟地滿足了。</p>
<p>「舊約新盟」的故事很簡單，把從小在一起長大的二個男子與一位女人間的戀愛糾紛，寫得極生動曲折。</p>
<p>自然，以如此好的物質條件，能做戲的優秀演員，來演出這樣的劇本，是不難獲得如現在演出的這樣成功的，若是説一張影片的所謂成功，就止於此，就止於僅僅是技術的成功的話。</p>
<p>對於熟悉瓊克勞馥，克拉克蓋博爾與勞勃脱蒙高茂萊的觀衆，是不用多説他們的演技的。這兒，在戀愛的糾紛中，他們都拿手地用所有奔放的熱情，與活躍的青春，演成了追求，放浪，失戀的創痛與得意的滿足這一套了。</p>
<p>導演范達克（W.S.VanDyke）除了以簡潔的畫面，活潑的剪接，聚精會神在主角戲的緊急過程上之外，更苦心地運用着副角來做了成功的活動背景。如少年之一的傑夫的朋友這一角色，他在他們的緊急關頭，處處是少不得的背景。由他的無言的站立與漫不經心的起坐間，代着了不少的戲。這兒有着二次婚禮，二次跳舞會的大塲面，導演者都能恰到好處地只是接觸到，而並不拉長了無謂的鏡頭來誇張，以减弱劇情進展的緊張性。同樣在女主角初度失戀後，住在鄉下，騎馬，開車，游泳以解除精神上苦悶的時候，也不曾把膠片浪費在女角肉體的賣弄上。</p>
<p>自然全片的導演上也不是説全無缺點的，如車壞遇雨，兩人宿在荒野的房舍中這一段，就太冗長得沉悶，而不得不用，不需要的跌筋斗，火燒這些來作噱頭了。</p>
<p>對白，攝影，以及言響效果，都頗完善。</p>
<h3>評「閨女秘史」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Broadway　Bill-國泰</p>
<p>佛蘭克卡勃拉（Frank　Capra）這一偉大的電影技術家，他在每一部作品上技術的成功，真是值得我們竭誠欽佩的。他是一個完全熟練了電影技術家，他是一個成功了的導演，至少在他的導演手法上，對於這些我們是没有理由可以否認的。</p>
<p>從「太夫人」（A　Lady　For　A　Day）「一夜風流」（It　Happenend　One　Night）對於這一位偉大的技術家，我們是早已認識了的。在他的作品中，從來没有一個真實的故事，在他作品中出現的没有我們通常所可看到的人物，但是他是一個偉大的説謊者，他可以憑着他生動的電影手法，將一個我們不敢相信的虚構的故事，獲得使我們不能不相信的效果。「太夫人」中的賣蘋果的窮老太婆，在人們熱誠的帮助之下，成爲一個百萬貴婦，她的熱情，感動了流氓，也感動了尊貴的市長。在「一夜風流」中，那一對流浪的男女，憑着二人胡調的本領，構成了所謂香艷風流的種種，那些都是我們不敢相信的。但是當我們在電影院裏的時候，我們却完全給迷惑住了，雖然我們知道那些都是謊言，然而這一謊言在善於説謊的卡勃拉講來，却和	真的一樣。（直到走出了戲院，遺留在我們心頭是美麗的快感，可是這快感不久便消散了，因爲我們到底覺得那是毫無真實性的謊言啊！）</p>
<p>在這一「閨女秘史」中（Broadway　Bill的名字）和上述的二部作品一樣，完全保持了一貫的作風。出現在這一影片中的人物，是個大富翁的女婿，他不慣富翁守舊的拘束，他愛賽馬，流浪，於是憑着他的小聰明，脱離了那頑固的家庭，和他的姨妹過着放蕩生活去了。差不多是用不着解釋的，那一樣一個青年，放棄安適的生活而甘心流浪，决不是通常可見的人物。至於劇的主題，爲了愛情，爲了自己的愛好，脱離富有的家庭而流浪，也不見得有何等可取的地方。從各方面來説，這裏没有可愛的內容，換言之，我們只看説明書上的故事，乃是毫無興趣的，但是他將這故事巧妙的結構成完全成爲電影藝術的組織，更憑着他生動的導演手法，這裏在畫面上表現出來的，真使我們太感動了，即是説電影藝術的情感的發揮，真是太成功了。</p>
<p>當我們作爲電影藝術的研究而鑒賞的時候，這一影片在技術上的成功，我們可以學習不少。他是那般縝密的安排了每一塲戲的空氣或氛圍，他是那般淸楚的描寫了劇中人的個性，他是那般適當調和了速度（Tempu）的快慢，假使我們要研究美國電影的織接法，這一影片正是極好的課本。</p>
<p>至於「華納斐斯茂娜洛埃或列蒙沃邦諸人的演技，在他的指導之下，他們的成功，當然是不用説得的了。」</p>

<h3>學童慈母（Crand　Old　Girl）（六）</h3>
<p>— 叔敏</p>
<p>露蘭貝爾斯想着，不覺微笑起來。如果吉莉肯照顧「前房」的話，那勝利就靠得住了！「前房」的勝利，就是克拉倫斯戴徳的失敗。並不是她和戴徳有什麽仇恨，一定要他失敗，不過她却一定要保護她的孩子們。一回桑狄來了。密斯貝爾斯正在付錢的時候，大門又開了。桑狄和密司貝爾斯大家都吃一驚，那進來的原來是吉莉傑賴，後面跟着她手下一帮嘍囉。起初密司貝爾斯還存着奢望，她和桑狄耳語道：「我覺得我們已經佔了全部勝利了。」可是桑狄皺着眉，很懷疑地看着吉莉。他説道：「且慢些高興，事情還没有完哩。」</p>
<p>不錯的，那一般人的臉上，都帶着不服氣的神氣。他們先跑到戴德那裏，那兒冷淸淸的毫無生趣。他們於是就跑到這「前房」來，或者可以惹些是非。吉利頭一個發難，她要求桑狄和她跳舞。密司貝爾斯還不知道她懷的不是好意，就笑着對了桑狄道：「那再好没有了」。她又對着吉莉道：「吉莉，你來了我真喜歡。請你以後常常來。」吉莉傲然道：「我自有好地方去。」桑狄爲避免吵鬧起見，立即走到吉莉面前。吉莉將他的臂一搿，就跳起舞來。她一面跳，一面對着桑狄道：「我希望你跳舞跳得和擲冰淇淋桶子一樣好。」他們跳了一回，吉莉又説道：「真想不到，今天有這個福氣和你跳舞。」</p>
<p>桑狄狠狠地對她看着，然後説道：「吉莉，你爲什麽不聰明些。你祇要給你自己一個小機會，就是再好没有的女孩子了。」吉莉啐道：「呸，誰要做好女孩子？」桑狄莊重的説道：「吉莉，我想你是處處裝假，時時做作，惟恐人家不注意你。」吉莉發怒道：「哦，你説我裝假嗎？」桑狄道：「我知道，所以我喜歡你到這個地方來，因爲你在這個地方，不得不守些規矩了。」吉莉道：「或者是的……或者不！」她將桑狄一推推開了，一個人跳起一種龍巴舞起來。這一下子，秩序就大亂起來。</p>
<p>桑狄走上前去，想禁止吉莉跳那種狂舞，但是吉莉手下的一般嘍囉，一擁而上，將桑狄拳打足踢的將他打倒在地下了。密司貝爾斯急得直搓手，無法喊阻。正在這亂烘烘的當兒，大門又開了。約瑟傑賴，加貝倫特，和當地一般要人都進來了。他們是來看着密司貝爾斯的「前房」，到底是怎樣一個於小孩子有益處的地方。可是他們看是這種神氣，大家就憤怒起來。傑賴喊道：「可恥！」</p>
<p>但是他還没有講第二句話，吉莉和她的一般嘍囉，都已一陣風似的，溜得影踪全無了。他們都跳上了吉莉的跑車，風馳電掣地去了。桑狄亦就走了出來，開著貨車在後面追趕，「前房」中祇剩了密司貝爾斯一個人，去受一般大人物的訓斥和恥辱。</p>
<p>一回兒，桑狄的貨車，已經趕上了吉莉的跑車，因爲跑車的汽油用完了。大家看見桑狄的貨車趕上來，來得正好，大家呌他載他們回城去。可是桑狄不慌不忙地跳下了貨車，將吉莉輕輕一提，將她放在開車座位的旁邊。説時遲，那時快，桑狄霍的一下子，已經自己跳了上去，立即將車頭掉過來開走了，讓那一般孩子自己走回去吧。（未完）</p>

<h3>Establishment of the Wuchang Garrison Headquarters</h3>
<p>Commissioner Chiang's Admonishment to Staff</p>
<p>The Most Urgent Tasks Are None Other Than Educating the People and Disciplining the Army</p>
<p>Future Work Focuses on Opium Suppression and Promoting the New Life Movement</p>
<p>[Hankou] The Wuchang Garrison Headquarters was officially established on March 1st. A ceremony was held at 9:00 AM. Key officials such as Zhang Xueliang, Yang Yongtai, Qian Dajun, and Jin Tiyi, as well as over 400 people including Zhang Qun, Chen Bulei, and Yan Daogang, attended.

Commissioner Chiang then met in batches with personnel above section chief level from various departments at the Garrison Headquarters, led by the respective department heads and deputy heads. At 11:30 AM, he crossed the river back to Hankou for rest. Additionally, the key officials of the Garrison Headquarters were appointed by Commissioner Chiang in a handwritten note on the same day.

The Garrison Headquarters sent a circular telegram to all military and political organizations nationwide on the same day. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>[Hankou] The Wuchang Garrison Headquarters was officially established at 9:00 AM on the 1st, holding a simple ceremony. Commissioner Chiang gave an impromptu speech, providing instructions on future work. A circular telegram was sent to all parties to inform them, stating: "To the various departments, ministries, and committees in Nanjing, the Military Affairs Commission, the pacification commissioners of each province, the governments of each province, the municipal governments of each city, the commanders-in-chief, the commanders, the army commanders, division commanders, and independent brigade commanders, for your information: The Garrison Headquarters was established in Wuchang on March 1st and has commenced operations. A special telegram is sent for your review. Military Affairs Commission Chairman's Garrison Headquarters, Eastern (seal not printed)." (Central News Agency Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>[Hankou] Commissioner Chiang's speech to the staff at the Wuchang Garrison Headquarters on the 1st was as follows: "Today marks the establishment of the Garrison Headquarters. I will address the purpose and direction of the Garrison Headquarters' efforts to my fellow comrades. I believe that to realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, to revitalize the nation, and to save the country, the initial steps and most urgent tasks are none other than educating the people and disciplining the army. The future work of the Garrison Headquarters, on one hand, should intensify the supervision and suppression of remaining bandits, striving for their complete elimination within a set time frame to eradicate a source of trouble for the nation and the people. On the other hand, we should pay closer attention to reforming society, invigorating the people's spirit, and establishing the foundation for national revival. Based on this objective, what I consider urgent and wish to promote with all my strength, in a passive sense, is opium suppression; in an active sense, it is promoting the New Life Movement. Regarding opium suppression, the Garrison Headquarters' previously established six-year plan is an effective method for completely eradicating it. In the past year, the prohibition of opium cultivation in the provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui has shown results. The eradication of opium seedlings throughout the provinces of Jiangxi and Zhejiang has been particularly effective. The investigation of opium users and registration of opium addicts in Jiangsu has also yielded practical results. In the future, we should continue to implement the original plan thoroughly, aiming to extend the existing achievements to all provinces, and further achieve the goal of completely prohibiting the trafficking, manufacturing, and smoking of opium. Time passes easily; one year of the six-year period has already passed. This cannot but be hoped for from all comrades, all sectors of society, and all informed individuals nationwide, to join forces and assist. The New Life Movement, since its promotion by the Nanchang Garrison Headquarters last year, has, thanks to the concerted efforts of various regions, deeply ingrained the concept of this movement in people's hearts. The establishment of the new national life will truly begin with this. In the future, comrades at the Garrison Headquarters, in handling affairs, in addition to realizing the three principles of militarization, productionization, and artisticization stipulated in the New Life Movement guidelines, should also pay particular attention to the promotion of labor and service. I believe that only by taking labor as one's duty and service as one's purpose can life be truly meaningful. It is especially necessary to ensure that everyone can labor based on the concept of serving the country and society, in order to sweep away the past laziness and disorganization of our nation, establish a strong and united spirit, and save our country from its current poverty and difficulties. Educating the people through labor has shown results in the past; sacrificing oneself to benefit others should become the prevailing custom. The great cause of national revival must be expected from the promotion of the New Life Movement and the popularization of labor service groups. This is especially hoped for from all comrades to lead by example and lead the people of the whole country, so that everyone can fulfill their responsibilities and rise up together to contribute. As for the development of highway transportation, the organization of the people, and the popularization of education, these have been the fundamental policies for suppressing bandits since the establishment of the Nanchang Garrison Headquarters. All work that has been committed to but not yet completed in the past should continue its implementation and further enrich its meaning. In the past, the development of transportation was aimed at facilitating bandit suppression; in the future, it should aim at developing culture. In the past, raising the national intellect and seeking the popularization of people's education; in the future, education should be linked to various facilities in addition to popularization, so as to achieve the mission of educating the people and saving the country. The revolutionary cause is vast and great, but the way to start should be to prioritize the essentials. Therefore, I reveal the essentials to encourage my comrades to strive together." (Central News Agency Dispatch, 1st)</p>

<p>[Hankou] After consulting with Commissioner Chiang at the Central Bank this afternoon, Finance Minister Kong gave a special interview to the Reuters correspondent stationed in Hankou. He stated that the government's monetary policy has repeatedly stated that there will be no changes. His and Song Ziwen's visit to Hankou has nothing to do with the issue of Chinese exchange rates. He was quite surprised that the people of Shanghai attached importance to his trip to Hankou. His conversation with Chiang this afternoon was related to the preparation of the next fiscal year's budget and the discussion of currency policy in Sichuan Province. As for his views on the US silver purchase policy, they are already well known in Washington, D.C., so he did not want to say more. According to Reuters telegram from Geneva, China has a possible important role as a member of the League of Nations Administrative Council, which he was very pleased to hear.

<h3>Taxation Issues by the Mongolian Political Council</h3>
<p>Three Principles Have Been Agreed Upon</p>
<p>[Beiping] The Suiyuan-Mongolia tax dispute has shown signs of resolution since negotiations began in Peiping. Senior staff officer Xiao Renyuan of the Military Sub-Committee, and Chen Yujia and Zhang Xin, representatives of the Suiyuan Provincial Government, met with the two Princes Yun and De at Bailingmiao. The two sides' views have become closer. Detailed methods for tax collection have been drafted. Regarding the issue of setting up checkpoints, it is necessary to request instructions from the Central Government. Xiao and others have now returned to Peiping and Suiyuan. Bao Yueqing has now received a telegram from Prince De, instructing to consult with Xiao Zhenying and Shi Huayan in Peiping to resolve the issue. The Mongol side's request to set up checkpoints for tax collection in the Yi and Wu Leagues will be resolved after consultation between the two sides, and the matter will be concluded. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Relevant parties received a telegram from Xiao Renyuan stating that the Suiyuan-Mongolia tax dispute has been resolved after discussion with the Mongolian Political Council in Bailingmiao, along with the Suiyuan representatives. (1) The two regiments of Suiyuan troops that entered the Mongolian border areas such as Heisha Tuo and Wuliasu will be withdrawn immediately. (2) The tax checkpoints of the Suiyuan Provincial Government on the Mongolian border will be abolished, and the Mongolian Political Council will also not set up checkpoints. (3) A proportion of the tax revenue from goods transported from Gansu through Mongolia to Suiyuan will be allocated to the Mongolian Political Council. Both Suiyuan and Mongolia have agreed, and a formal resolution can be reached on the 1st. Xiao Zhenying has therefore cancelled his trip to Bailingmiao. The third congress of the Mongolian Political Council has been postponed because the tax revenue issue has not been resolved. Bao Yueqing is scheduled to return to the temple on the 10th to participate. It is said that the central issue of this congress of the Mongolian Political Council will be the increase in the number of security forces. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Regarding the issue of the Mongolian Political Council setting up checkpoints to collect taxes, the Military Sub-Committee previously dispatched senior staff officer Xiao Renyuan, together with Chen Qin and Zhang Qing, representatives of the Suiyuan Provincial Government, to Bailingmiao to discuss a solution with Prince De. Because the two sides, Mongolia and Suiyuan, were due to a misunderstanding, after explanation, the estrangement was completely eliminated. Prince De also expressed his willingness to make concessions. Therefore, a preliminary solution has been successfully achieved. Xiao and others went to Suiyuan on the 28th to meet with Fu Zuoyi to report on the negotiations. Fu also expressed great satisfaction and hoped that a concrete solution could be reached as soon as possible. Xiao and others then went to Bailingmiao again to meet with Prince De, conveyed Fu's views, and discussed everything in detail. It is reported that the two sides have agreed on three principles: (1) The tax checkpoints set up by Chahar and Suiyuan in Mongolia will be abolished. (2) The bandit suppression troops sent by the Suiyuan Provincial Government to Mongolia will be withdrawn. (3) A portion of the tax revenue will be allocated to the Mongolian Political Council. Now that both sides have agreed to these principles, it is expected that a complete resolution will be reached within days. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>War Zone Issues Largely Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>Sino-Japanese Representatives Complete Consultations</p>
<p>New Security Force to Take Over Defense in Mid-Month</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The war zone issues have been largely agreed upon after days of consultation in Tianjin between responsible personnel from China and Japan. The newly organized security forces of Zhang Qingyu and Zhang Yantian stationed in Yangcun and Caicun are scheduled to enter the war zone in mid-month to relieve the existing troops. The number of personnel is set at 5,000. A part of the Yutian security force will be transferred to Tongzhou, and another part will be transferred to Kaiping. Preparations for departure are currently underway. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The Sino-Japanese Tianjin Conference decided on the defense areas of the new security forces: one battalion stationed in Yutian, one battalion stationed in Ji County and Zunhua, one battalion stationed in Miyun and Huairou, one battalion stationed in Pinggu and Tong County. These belong to the Jiji-Miyun area under Zhang Yantian's command. One battalion stationed in Qian'an and Fengrun, one battalion stationed in Changli, one battalion stationed in Haiyangzhen and Shimen, one battalion stationed in Funing, one battalion stationed in Leting, and one special company stationed in Beidaihe. These belong to Zhang Qing's command. The issues in the war zone, at the Tianjin meeting, regarding the troop relief of the security forces, the crackdown on Japanese and Korean vagrants' drug trafficking organizations, and the troop transfer and reorganization of the Yutian force, are all based on the principles of the Peiping-Tianjin meeting last month, deciding on the implementation steps. In addition, discussions were held on communication, telegraph, remittance, revision and improvement of various items, and tariff rates at the various passes of the Great Wall, to avoid double taxation. The inspection methods for Japanese cargo ships at Yuguan and Qinhuangdao, both sides were unwilling to disclose because of the greater relationship. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] After the Yutian security replenishment force is transferred, the new security force will move in, numbering about 640, a full battalion, stationed in the county seat and the towns of Lin Nancang and Yahongqiao. The war zone security replenishment force of Feng Shoupeng's command will be entirely transferred to Kaiping. Zhao Lei has sent personnel to Kaiping to find suitable barracks, totaling fifty rooms, to be repaired. They can move in around the 10th. Fifty members of Feng's command arrived in Tangshan on the 27th to make advance arrangements. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>[Beiping] The person in charge of negotiating the implementation details of the war zone issues in Tianjin has reported the process to Nanjing for instructions by telegram. It is heard that the authorities still have several points that need to be considered. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The Sino-Japanese representatives in Tianjin have agreed to temporarily withhold the results of the meetings for the past several days, and that the announcement will be made simultaneously in Peiping and Changchun before the implementation. Military Attaché Takahashi will go to Changchun within days to report on the progress of the negotiations and is expected to return to Peiping around the 10th, at which time the implementation can be announced. Yin Tong, Yin Rugeng, Zhu Shiqin, and Tao Shangming met with Takahashi, Tanaka, and Kawaguchi at the guest room of the Beining Railway Garden at 1:00 PM on the 1st to discuss the unfinished items of the two-day agreement and supplementary opinions. They dispersed at around 4:00 PM. Yin Rugeng said that the details of this consultation cannot be disclosed yet because the time for public announcement has not arrived. Because the matter is in progress, it is still uncertain whether there will be any changes in the middle. The announcement will be officially made before the implementation. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Tao Shangming said that the Sino-Japanese consultations on war issues in Tianjin are only about the most important issues at present, and there are still some that need to be discussed by the Qing Commission before consulting with the Japanese side. The eastward movement of the new security force to relieve the Yutian forces, and the transfer of Sun Jizhou's command to Kaiping, are not major problems. Only the Japanese side opposes the transfer of Liu Zuozhou and Zhao Lei's commands out of the war zone for training, believing it is unnecessary. The other items agreed upon are being carried out separately. The conflict between Liu Zuozhou and the Luan County militia has been resolved through mediation in Tangshan, and they have recently been at peace. Military Attaché Takahashi left Tianjin for Peiping at 8:10 PM on the 1st and will soon go to Changchun to report. The war zone issues in Tianjin were concluded on the afternoon of the 1st. Yin and Tao are scheduled to go to Peiping on the 2nd. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>

<h3>Discussion on Relief for the Shanghai Market</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Local Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Banking and Money Trade Association, and other groups, recognizing the recent economic slump in the market and the decline of all industries, believe that unless prompt measures are taken to remedy the situation, it will inevitably worsen and lead to an unthinkable state of affairs. Therefore, they convened a meeting to discuss relief plans and sent representatives to see Finance Minister Kong, presenting relief measures in person. This can be described as addressing the most urgent needs. The proposed relief measures involve requesting the Ministry of Finance to order the Central Bank to allocate substantial funds for lending to the industrial and commercial sectors, in order to regulate and stabilize the market. The collateral for these loans would be real estate and goods. From the perspective of addressing immediate needs, these relief measures are certainly appropriate. Now, Finance Minister Kong has adopted these proposals and has separately instructed the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications to make every effort to grant loans to those in various industries who provide reliable collateral, in order to maintain the market and enable all industries to develop vigorously. Thus, the preliminary measures for relieving the Shanghai market are already underway. However, there are still things we cannot refrain from saying.</p>
<p>The economic slump in Shanghai is due to external factors, such as the impact of the global economic panic, and domestic factors, such as the bankruptcy of Chinese rural areas and the weakness of the people's purchasing power. Therefore, the fundamental solution lies in focusing on the global market and the rural economy. Regarding the global market, it is temporarily beyond our control, so we will not discuss it for now. As for revitalizing the rural economy, it should be pursued simultaneously with the short-term solutions as part of an overall relief strategy. If we rely solely on requesting banks to grant loans as a solution, it will, at best, only be a temporary adjustment of funds. What will happen after this temporary adjustment is another question that will arise. Furthermore, whether the Central Bank, as the bank of banks, should accept real estate and goods as collateral for loans is another issue. Therefore, I humbly suggest that we use short-term measures to alleviate the immediate crisis in the market and revitalize the rural economy to prevent a recurrence of the predicament after the short-term measures are implemented. Addressing both the symptoms and the root causes may seem impractical, but it is actually the only viable approach. This is the first point I would like to discuss with those who are discussing market relief today.</p>
<p>Regarding the short-term measures for relieving the Shanghai market in Shanghai, the voluntary reduction of rent by real estate owners is an effective method. In the past, when the Shanghai market was prosperous, land prices and rents rose accordingly. The high prices were not only the highest in the country but also gradually reached a global level. This is a case of "a rising tide lifts all boats." Now, with the economic slump, goods are being sold at reduced prices, yet sales are still sluggish. How can industrial and commercial businesses bear the burden of huge rents? Just look at the numerous cases of rent arrears for several months or more, and even bankruptcies resulting from them. This shows the severity of the situation. As a result, land prices have plummeted, and there are many vacant houses in the city. Real estate owners are in danger of suffering the same fate. We firmly believe that there are many enlightened individuals in the Shanghai real estate industry who can voluntarily reduce rents to alleviate the burden on the industrial and commercial sectors. This is a way to relieve the market and also a way to save themselves. To invigorate the market, it is necessary to ensure the smooth flow of goods and attract people's interest in buying them. The most important way to promote the smooth flow of goods is to make them affordable. If rents are not reduced, industrial and commercial businesses will bear a heavy burden, making it difficult to lower prices. This is a simple concept that most people can understand. The real estate industry is aware of this but is still clinging to short-term gains and unable to implement rent reductions. Therefore, urging the real estate industry to implement rent reductions is also the responsibility of those who are discussing market relief today. This is the second point I would like to discuss with you.</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Discusses Penalties for Obstructing Silver Standard Currency</h3>
<p>First Request the Central Political Council to Decide on Principles Before Deliberating</p>
<p>Draft Law on Fortified Areas and Fortresses Passed with Amendments</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Legislative Yuan held its seventh meeting on the morning of the 1st, with 69 members including Wu Shangying present. Sun Ke presided as chairman, and Liang Hancao as secretary-general. The following important cases were discussed: (1) The Finance and Criminal Law Committees reported on the draft temporary regulations on penalties for obstructing silver standard currency. Resolved: passed according to the review report. The review result is to first request the Central Political Council to decide on principles before further deliberation. (2) The Legislative Committee reported on the proposed amendments to Article 11 of the Organic Law of the Control Yuan. Resolved: passed with amendments according to the review report. It is stipulated that the Control Yuan will have 20 staff members, 10 of whom may be recommended, and the rest appointed. (3) The Military Committee reported on the proposed amendments to the Draft Law on Fortified Areas and Fortresses. Resolved: passed with amendments. The full text consists of 16 articles. (4) The Land and Legal System Committees reported on the Draft Implementation Law of the Land Law. The full text consists of 91 articles. Articles 1 to 23 were resolved and passed with amendments after a second reading. The remaining articles and other proposals will be discussed at next week's meeting. The meeting adjourned at 12 o'clock. (Central News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Finance and Criminal Law Committees of the Legislative Yuan held a joint meeting to review the Draft Temporary Regulations on Penalties for Obstructing Silver Standard Currency, and invited representatives from the Judicial Yuan to attend and provide explanations. It was decided to first request the Central Political Council to decide on principles before further deliberation. The reasons are as follows: After investigating, it was found that a currency standard should have three elements: (1) free exchange of banknotes, (2) free minting of standard coins, and (3) free import and export of silver. If any of these three is missing, it cannot be called a standard. For example, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan all used the gold standard, but due to changing circumstances, they have all abandoned it one after another. Although the methods of abandonment are different, such as the United States adopting the suspension of free exchange of banknotes, the United Kingdom adopting the suspension of free minting of standard coins, and Japan adopting the prohibition of free export of cash, the result is the same. China's currency is based on silver, and the standard coin is the silver dollar. Banknotes can be freely exchanged, silver can be freely entrusted to the mint for minting silver dollars, and silver can be freely imported and exported. Although the export of silver entrusted for export is restricted, the export of silver for international payments is still free. Therefore, all three elements of the silver standard are fully met. If the destruction of silver coins entails criminal liability, it is tantamount to preventing the export of silver, which is tantamount to depriving one of the three elements of the currency standard, and thus tantamount to abolishing the silver standard. Abolishing the silver standard is a major national policy, which should first be decided on principles by the Central Political Council before being submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation, which is more appropriate. This review result has been passed by the Yuan's meeting on the 1st. (Central News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Draft Implementation Law of the Land Law and its related regulations have been reviewed by the Legal System and Land Committees of the Legislative Yuan and submitted to the Yuan's meeting on the morning of the 1st for deliberation. The main points of the Implementation Law of the Land Law are approximately three points: (1) Matters not clearly stipulated in the Land Law that should be stipulated are stipulated in this law. (2) In areas where land administration matters have been carried out before the implementation of the Land Law, if there is a need for correction after the implementation of the Land Law, appropriate provisions are made in this law to provide relief. (3) Regarding provisions of the Land Law that need to be supplemented, they are supplemented in this law. After review, the law has 91 articles, divided into five chapters: General Provisions, Land Registration, Land Use, Land Tax, and Land Expropriation. As for the regulations related to this law, such as the Regulations on the Appointment of Survey and Deed Specialists, the Legal System and Land Committees' review opinions propose to draft them after the establishment of the central land administration agency. Since the Regulations on the Handling of Public Land have been incorporated into the Land Law and its Implementation Law, it seems unnecessary to separately formulate them. Other drafts, such as the Organic Law of the Land Tribunal, the Provisional Measures for the Land Tribunal to be Affiliated to Courts at All Levels, and the Organic Law of the Central Land Administration Office, involve important issues such as the affiliation of the Land Tribunal and the name of the central land administration agency. The review opinions of the two committees have requested the Yuan President to forward them to the Central Political Council for review and further discussion. The Yuan's meeting on the morning of the 1st only passed a part of the Implementation Law of the Land Law after a second reading. (Central News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Central People's Movement Committee Concerned About Shanghai Industry and Commerce</h3>

Currently, workers nationwide have a clear understanding of the country and the nation, and both labor and capital can cooperate sincerely and jointly assume responsibility for protecting factories. Although the request from the Beijing Women's Association to implement the Factory Law and demand equal pay for men and women is justified, these demands are not practical in today's economic recession.

<h3>Judicial Yuan Interprets Ambiguities in the Maritime Law</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Central People's Movement Committee requested an interpretation of ambiguities in the Maritime Law. The Judicial Yuan's interpretation is as follows: If a crew member dies during the employment period or dies due to the performance of duties, the Maritime Law only stipulates an additional salary. Before other compensations are stipulated, if a seafarer encounters an accident and loses his life, he should only be given an additional salary in accordance with that article. Since Article 45 of the Factory Law is not provided for in the Maritime Law, seafarers may not use it as an example. If a crew member is disabled due to an accident, before other regulations are available, Articles 60 to 64 of the Maritime Law regarding injuries should be applied. If crew members on ships are not paid salaries due to custom, if they die, it should also be handled according to custom. If, according to custom, the benefits they receive each month are regarded as their salary, then they may be given an additional proportional amount in accordance with Article 67 of the Maritime Law from the date of their death, otherwise the provisions of that article shall not apply.

All restaurants and public entertainment venues throughout the country were completely open on March 1st and 2nd to share the joy with the people. (National News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Reception Ceremony</h3>
<p>Saarbrucken The official ceremony for the handover of the Saar to Germany began at 9:30 this morning. First, the chairman of the Saar Governing Commission, Italian Baron Aloisi, and the other members signed a document with German Interior Minister Dr. Frick, stating that they would abide by the League of Nations resolution to hand over the entire Saar region to Germany. At 10:15, the Interior Minister announced the handover on the radio. At that time, all the loudspeakers throughout the region broadcast Dr. Frick's words, "The time of freedom has arrived!" At 10:30, the German flag was raised in front of the new city hall in Saarbrucken, and the administrative power of the Saar region was handed over to Mr. Booker, the local Nazi Party leader. At this point, the ceremony was completed. Those who participated in the ceremony included Mr. Hess, the representative of the German Head of State Hitler, General Goering, the Prime Minister of Prussia, Dr. Goebbels, the Minister of Propaganda, and other senior Nazi Party officials.

<h3>Speech by the German Interior Minister</h3>
<p>When the document for the handover of the Saar was signed this morning, German Interior Minister Dr. Frick addressed the Saar Governing Commission, saying that the German government firmly believes that with the Saar issue resolved, the peaceful cooperation between nations has taken a further step. He concluded by saying, "We can never tolerate German land being forcibly seized by others." After announcing the completion of the handover on the radio, Frick ordered the German flag to be raised at the Saarbrucken government office and then handed over the administrative power of the Saar to Mr. Booker, saying, "The Saar issue was resolved by the Saar people themselves, which is enough to show the struggle for justice without the need for weapons." While the handover ceremony was in progress, crowds gathered outside the office, shouting "Long live Germany!" and "Long live Hitler!" At the same time, factories and steamers all over Germany sounded their whistles, and the churches rang their bells. National flags and Nazi Party flags were hung in all cities and towns to mark the celebration. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>End of League of Nations Rule</h3>
<p>Saarbrucken The League of Nations Saar Tripartite Committee, led by Chairman Aloisi, arrived here this afternoon. After Aloisi and others got off the train, they immediately drove to the Governing Commission's office. The Chairman of the Governing Commission, General Knox, informally handed over political power to Aloisi. Aloisi immediately thanked Knox on behalf of the League of Nations for his years of service in governing the Saar. Knox soon set off to return to England, and Mr. Hamberger, the French internal special envoy, also set off to return to France. According to general opinion, the members of the Governing Commission were not very popular with the public, and it was expected that they would not want to participate in the German-Saar merger ceremony. Since they have left one after another, the only person who will act as the final official in the transfer of power will be the League of Nations representative Aloisi. Furthermore, the Saarbrucken City Council also held its last meeting under the League of Nations rule today. However, the Marxist elements seemed to have understood the changing times and did not attend. The mayor and Mr. Kritsch gave speeches on the spot, saying that the transitional period in 1935 had many difficulties, but the German government had formulated a detailed economic plan for the Saar region, and the number of unemployed people in the region was expected to decrease after the merger, by about one-third within a few months. At the end of the meeting, a solemn declaration was issued, unanimously supporting Chancellor Hitler. (National Telegraph, 28th)</p>
<h3>Hitler Suddenly Arrives</h3>
<p>Saarbrücken - German Führer Adolf Hitler arrived here by plane this morning from Berlin, landing at 12:20 PM. He then toured the city streets by car, standing alongside the driver. Crowds lined the streets and cheered. (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Hitler arrived here at noon today by car from Mannheim, where he was warmly welcomed by the public. In the morning, he flew to Mannheim in a private plane with the German Minister to Vienna, Mr. von Papen, and Dr. Bruckner, followed by three other planes: one carrying his aides and two filled with news reporters. He then switched to a car to reach here. Tens of thousands of people gathered from morning, eagerly awaiting his arrival despite the heavy rain. When Hitler's plane appeared in the sky, the cheers of the crowd reached the clouds. After the plane landed, Hitler emerged with a smile, giving the Nazi salute to express his gratitude. Soon after, the crowd gathered around the hotel where Hitler was staying, shouting "We want to see the Führer!" Hitler repeatedly appeared on the balcony, smiling and nodding his thanks. He is scheduled to deliver a "startling" speech tonight. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Führer Participates in Parade</h3>
<p>Saarbrücken - At 2:30 PM today, the people here held a grand parade to celebrate the Saar's return to the motherland. Hitler personally attended. After a large-scale demonstration at 6 PM, Hitler will deliver a speech. In addition, Hitler's party representative Hess, Propaganda Minister Goebbels, and Special Envoy to the Saar Berger will also speak at the demonstration. (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Wildly Enthusiastic Celebration</h3>
<p>Germans arriving in the Saar by train to participate in the celebration have been arriving in an endless stream all day. The crowds gathered in the streets here last night did not disperse all night. Thousands of prisoners in the Saar were also able to participate in the celebration because Hitler issued a general amnesty order, releasing all those sentenced to one year of imprisonment or less today. Leaders of the stormtroopers, the SS, and other political organizations were busy yesterday preparing to welcome people from Germany. The fact that Saar police officers appeared on the streets today for the first time in German police uniforms was also a noteworthy event. Many government officials have replaced their Saar black, white, and blue badges with German black, white, and red ones. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Announcement of Amnesty for Criminals</h3>
<p>[Berlin] Führer Hitler today formally announced that March 1st would be designated "Freedom Day" to commemorate the Saar's return to Germany, and granted amnesty to thousands of criminals in the Saar region. This amnesty is a reduction of sentences for ordinary first-time offenders; "political prisoners" are not included. The Saar region has a very strong feeling for the National Socialist government. Now that this order has been received, they will naturally be even more excited, and will hold a large celebration on "Freedom" Day. The general public views Hitler's amnesty for first-time offenders as an expression of gratitude to the people for trusting the German political system when they voted. (National dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Transfer of Police Authority on the Eve</h3>
<p>Saarbrücken - Although the Saar territory will not be merged with the motherland until tomorrow, police authority within the Saar region was officially transferred to Germany today. The reason is that when the Saar territory is merged with Germany on March 1st, no less than hundreds of thousands of Germans will go to participate in the celebration, and order will be difficult to maintain. Since the German authorities must assume responsibility for maintaining law and order that day, they must first obtain police authority one day in advance. The representative of the German government who received police authority today was Dr. Sachsen. After Sachsen received police authority from Knox, the chairman of the Saar Governing Commission, he appointed stormtrooper leader Schmelcher as the Saar District Police Commissioner. (National dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Disappearance of the French Flag</h3>
<p>Saarbrücken - The French flag, which was flown over various French-managed mines and buildings, was taken down uniformly tonight. After fifteen years, the League of Nations' power in the Saar has come to an end, and the French flag will no longer be seen in Saar territory. Tomorrow morning, Knox, the chairman of the three-member commission, will formally transfer the Saar regional government to the German authorities. 300,000 members of the German Front will celebrate the Saar's return to the motherland tomorrow. After the Saar region is merged with Germany, it will be administered as a special administrative region directly under the control of Interior Minister Frick. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Knox Receives Knighthood</h3>
<p>London - The British King today bestowed a knighthood on Knox, the former chairman of the Saar Governing Commission. This highly renowned "Saar Great Man" has become a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George. Sir Knox is 50 years old, a sincere Englishman with the talents of a Scotsman and the wisdom of an Irishman. From this, one can infer the mixed heritage of his ancestors. The honor bestowed by the Royal Family today is a reward for lifelong service to the Empire. Knox is one of the few talents who rose from the British Consulate into the diplomatic world, having originally served as an interpreter. (National dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Patriotic Demonstration</h3>
<p>A patriotic demonstration took place in the border town of Bérivillers on the Avenue de Maine in Paris. During the ceremony for the return of the Saar, the town also held the unveiling ceremony of a monument inscribed with "German loyalty, German faith, German customs, can never be taken from us."

<h3>Austria Forbids People to Celebrate</h3>
<p>[Vienna] Several hundred students from the University of Vienna gathered in the university auditorium this afternoon to celebrate the Saar's return to Germany. As they were singing the German national anthem, the school authorities called the police, and more than 200 people were arrested. The reason given was that the government had recently issued an order prohibiting all kinds of parades, demonstrations, or celebrations related to the Saar's return to Germany within Austrian territory.

<h3>Washington Filled with Daytime Spy Terror Atmosphere</h3>
<p>Disguised Chauffeurs Inquire About News</p>
<p>The Loss of the Airship Arouses Suspicion</p>
<p>[Washington] The unpredictable Japanese spies have appeared in the Washington official arena again today. Since airship expert Crabtree twice stated that the crash of the airship Macon was caused by someone sabotaging the machinery, Congressman Sirovich immediately declared that thousands of Asians are employed on American warships, so once war breaks out with Japan, they may continue to sabotage. Sirovich continued that Japanese spies in Washington obtain positions as chauffeurs to eavesdrop on officials' conversations. It is rumored that Japanese drivers spare no effort to park their cars near the State Department and the Navy Department, hoping to eavesdrop on American officials' criticisms and notify Tokyo. Sirovich is the chairman of the House Licensing Committee, so he is nominally responsible for investigating the Macon incident. On his suggestion, Crabtree testified before the committee. Crabtree repeatedly claimed that the Filipino attendants on the doomed Macon may have poured acid on the metal plates, causing the Macon to fall into the Pacific Ocean. The attendant is of Japanese descent. (National dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>The United States Pays Attention to Japan's Economic Aid to China</h3>
<p>Considers it a Violation of the Nine-Power Treaty</p>
<p>[Washington] Recently, the United States and several other signatory countries to the Nine-Power Treaty have been paying close attention to China's financial situation, especially the Sino-Japanese rapprochement. Washington officials do not want to discuss it, but according to reliable sources, the authorities here deeply regret China's current financial crisis and are extremely concerned about whether the United States' silver policy has caused damage. Officials here sympathize with any move to help China, but do not want any one country to act alone. Some familiar with the situation believe that the degree of Sino-Japanese rapprochement may not be as great as reported in Shanghai. Both the Japanese in Washington and Tokyo claim to know nothing about economic aid to China. They insist that Japan only wants to harmonize Sino-Japanese relations. According to the United States' long-standing policy toward China, which is based on the cooperation of all countries to aid China as expressed in the Nine-Power Treaty, it is unlikely to approve of unilateral aid to China.

<h3>The Red and White Problems Promote Sino-Japanese Compromise</h3>
<p>Japan's Hegemonic Plan Takes a Further Step</p>
<p>The Far East Theater of War Will Become Increasingly Imminent</p>
<p>Observations of New York Experts</p>
<p>[New York] Expert Piscopo of the Foreign Policy Association declared today that the United States' silver purchase plan has promoted the contraction of China's currency, which is the main reason for the Sino-Japanese compromise. Piscopo also discussed the impact of the Soviet Russian problem on China and Japan, saying that the common interest of the two countries lies in preventing the Communist Party, so China and Japan are carrying out mutual cooperation due to economic and political relations. According to reports from Shanghai, this coordination will further Japan's plan to dominate the Far East. At the same time, Japan will be in a position where it has no choice but to go to war with Soviet Russia. Japanese leaders now anticipate this. (National dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Ministry Discusses Sino-Japanese Cooperation Plan</h3>
<p>Eradicating Anti-Japanese Movement is a Prerequisite</p>
<p>South Manchuria Railway Company Expands to the Yangtze River and South China</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs held the second conference on the establishment of concrete measures for Sino-Japanese cooperation at 28th afternoon. Director-General of the East Asia Bureau Kuwashima, Director-General of the Commerce Bureau Kurasu, Commercial Counselor Yokotake, and other related officials attended, and Director of the Treasury Division of the Ministry of Finance Yumoto was invited to attend. After various discussions, including inquiring about the intentions of the Ministry of Finance regarding concrete measures for Sino-Japanese cooperation centered on silver issues and loan issues, the meeting adjourned after about two hours, but no final decision was reached. The Foreign Ministry's views on Sino-Japanese cooperation are generally as follows: (1) The fundamental issue of Sino-Japanese cooperation is that the Chinese side must first eradicate the anti-Japanese movement. Therefore, the National Government should take the lead in purchasing Japanese goods and prevent the anti-Japanese movement. (2) If the Chinese side expresses concrete sincerity, in addition to providing technical assistance for the self-reliance of the Chinese economic community, it is also prepared to provide loans and other financial assistance.

<h3>Japan Denies Proposal for a Naval Holiday</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] Both the Foreign Ministry and the Navy Ministry today denied reports from London that Japan intends to advance the naval holiday, stopping shipbuilding for three years from 1935-38. The Foreign Ministry spokesman said today when foreign journalists inquired about this matter that the Japanese government was not aware of such a proposal. Japan's naval policy has explained its purpose during the London talks, which is to establish a new agreement based on Japan's proposal. The Japanese government believes this proposal is fair and equal, and he has not seen any change in the government's attitude. He has also not seen a report submitted to the government by Yamamoto after returning from London that advocates stopping shipbuilding. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Issues Booklet Stimulating War Sentiment</h3>
<p>[Moscow] The Japanese military has recently issued a booklet entitled "Japan's Resolutions in Extraordinary Times." The Pravda commented, "The Japanese military's issuance of this booklet is noteworthy, especially the booklet aimed at correcting the Japanese government's foreign policy." The newspaper recalled the booklet issued by the Japanese military on October 1 last year, which aroused sharp comments around the world. "The entire content of the newly issued booklet is focused on one goal, which is to increase the 'Japanese war spirit.'" The anti-war sentiment of the Japanese people is rising, which is a serious threat to the aggressive plans of Japanese imperialism, and the growth of anti-war sentiment within the military is an even greater threat. Therefore, in order to restore what is called "Japanese spirit," the Japanese warlords have to use drastic measures. Judging from the nature of the two booklets issued by the Japanese military, there is no doubt that they were drafted by the Araki faction, because the members of this faction are the most aggressive elements of Japanese imperialism. They advocate immediate outbreak of war, as in the past. The issuance of this booklet this time is widespread enough to prove the intensified activities of these aggressive elements.

<h3>British and French Foreign Ministers Talk in Paris, Joint Position of the Two Countries Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>Confirm that the London Declaration is Entirely Indivisible</p>
<p>Simon's Visit to Germany is Limited to an Exploratory Nature</p>
<p>[Paris] Today, the British and French Foreign Ministers held talks during and after a banquet at the British Embassy in France for more than two hours. In addition to French Foreign Minister Laval and British Foreign Secretary Simon, a very small number of people attended the talks and agreed to remain silent, so there is no way to get news from the outside. However, after the British and French Foreign Ministers thoroughly explored the London Declaration of February 3, it has been confirmed that the joint position adopted by the two countries has not changed. Although Germany has attempted to separate the various elements of the London Declaration, the United Kingdom and France have always recognized that if true peace in Europe is to be achieved, the British and French proposals must remain indivisible. The British and French proposals for a Sky Convention, a Danube Convention, an Eastern European Convention, Germany's return to Geneva, and the signing of an arms limitation convention are all of equal importance and must be discussed simultaneously. Solving one of these issues requires solving all the other issues together. In addition, it is heard that Simon's visit to Germany will be limited to an interview nature. Simon will explain the purpose and scope of the London Agreement to the leaders of the German government. The German reply to the United Kingdom and France on February 17 only mentioned the Sky Convention. Simon will inquire the German government's overall opinion on the British and French Agreement. Afterwards, Simon will return to the United Kingdom to consider with France whether there is any possibility of further developing the negotiations. At that time, personnel may be sent to Moscow, Warsaw, and the Czech capital. As for the date of Simon's visit to the capitals of Eastern European countries, the occasional delay does not contain other meanings. Because the Soviet Union has not yet made a formal invitation, and Simon's trip to Eastern Europe is limited to Russia and Poland, the plan may as well be slightly changed. Because countries such as the Czech Republic have a special relationship with the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Convention, Simon may also need to visit them on the way. In short, the British and French talks this time have reaffirmed that the United Kingdom and France still hold the common views stated in the London Declaration. France has expressed trust in Simon's visit to Germany from the beginning. Now that the United Kingdom and France have this consistent expression of opinion before Simon's departure to Germany, it cannot be said that it is not extremely important. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>[London] According to reliable sources, British Foreign Secretary Simon will go to Berlin at the end of next week for a two- or three-day stay to discuss everything with German Führer Hitler. According to the News Association, Simon may visit Moscow and Warsaw, but Simon will first return to London directly from Berlin to report what he has negotiated with the German authorities to the Cabinet for decision. If there is a need to go to Soviet Russia in fact, he will go to Moscow immediately. It has not yet been decided whether Lord Privy Seal Eden will accompany Simon to Berlin, because all parties do not approve of Simon, Eden, and Stanhope (now in Geneva), three important diplomats, leaving the capital at the same time.

<h3>Simon's Speech in France on the Characteristics of the British Political System</h3>
<p>The Parliamentary System Has Been Despised by Contemporaries</p>
<p>The United Kingdom and France Should Study Each Other and Maintain It Without Change</p>
<p>[Paris] British Foreign Secretary Simon was invited by the Paris Times to give a speech on the British parliamentary system, with Prime Minister Flandin presiding. Simon concluded in his speech, "Now that various countries in Europe are competing to adopt new political systems, the parliamentary system has been despised by contemporaries. The only two major countries that can maintain the democratic parliamentary system without change are the United Kingdom and France. For this reason, it is necessary for the United Kingdom and France to study their political systems with each other." Regarding the British parliamentary system, he said that the British constitution is flexible, with no written regulations, and can be changed at any time. Therefore, without the spirit of respecting traditional concepts, this kind of constitution is very dangerous. The average life of the British cabinet is longer compared to other countries. The reason is that there are only two or three major parties in the British Parliament, and the party divisions are not as scattered as in other countries, so a stable majority party can be produced. Moreover, when the Parliament has no confidence in the government, the government can dissolve the Parliament and re-elect it. This habit is also a characteristic of the British political system. Simon went on to say that speaking here has always been a new expression of British-French friendship. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>The Hope for Peace Between Italy and Abyssinia is Only a Glimmer</h3>

The rumors have been denied by officials, who said that the two ships left Malta to cruise the Mediterranean and did not carry political characteristics. (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>The United Kingdom Temporarily Does Not Use the Equalization Fund and the Pound Price Continues to Weaken</h3>
<p>Paris Rumors That the United Kingdom and the United States Have a Behind-the-Scenes Understanding</p>
<p>[London] Today, the price of the pound continued to weaken due to the temporary non-use of the equalization fund, and was under the pressure of the withdrawal of deposits from Europe in the United Kingdom. The non-use of the British equalization fund has now caused rumors in Europe. It is said that the British authorities want to suppress the price of the pound, especially against the US exchange. According to the opinion of well-known bankers, Europe has a low attitude towards the pound because of a deep belief based on its own experience that any currency that deviates from cash will depreciate sooner or later. The US Exchange Equalization Fund has now been selling US dollars in succession in order to make the US dollar and the pound fall at the same time. This is the reason why the pound has fallen more against European and American currencies than against the US dollar. People in Paris expect President Roosevelt to raise the price of gold calculated in US dollars when the pound falls to a price of 72.75 francs and affects the US dollar. There is also a rumor in Paris that behind the scenes of the pound's depreciation is an understanding between the United Kingdom and the United States, the purpose of which is to force gold-using countries to surrender to the United Kingdom and the United States. However, people in London do not believe in this rumor. Parisian brokers are still pessimistic about the future of the British exchange, so they sold the pound tonight and reached a new low of 72.89 francs. Today, investment demand on the London Stock Exchange is still good, and most of them bought British top-class bonds and gold mine stocks. The general market situation is better than before. Since the price of the pound has fallen again when calculated in US dollars and francs, the price of gold has reached a new high of 144 shillings and one penny. In the afternoon, it continued to rise to 144 shillings and nine pennies, but there was no transaction at this price. The reason why the pound is weak is that the British authorities have not used their equalization fund to stabilize the pound price. London financial experts admit that the British equalization fund has recently suffered great losses, but they do not believe the rumors in Paris that the British equalization fund is now about to be exhausted.

<h3>A Pear Blossom Tree Weighs Down a Begonia</h3>
<p>A Thirteen-Year-Old Girl Marries a Sixty-Year-Old Man</p>
<p>Gandhi Protests for Humanity</p>
<p>Bombay, India - A wealthy Hindu man, 60 years of age, is to marry a 13-year-old girl soon. Mahatma Gandhi specially telegraphed the National Congress to protest this matter, saying that it is inappropriate for a minor girl to marry an old man. Gandhi also ordered his followers to try to resist it, so that white hair and rosy cheeks cannot form a good marriage. According to reports, a similar incident occurred in 1931. At that time, an old landlord married a young girl. On the day of the wedding, Gandhi's followers organized a funeral procession, escorting them along the street, adding ridicule. This matter has been separated by four years, and now the old story is being repeated. Recently, India has been in turmoil over the issue of constitutional reform, and now there is such a fun story, which is enough to relieve boredom. (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>The Conditions for the Siamese King's Restoration are Rejected by the Parliament</h3>
<p>[London] The King of Siam, who is living here as a lodger, previously amended the article in the criminal law that requires the death penalty or life imprisonment to be approved by the King through a bill passed by the country's parliament. The King believes that depriving him of his original privileges, he refused to approve this bill and conceived the intention to abdicate. Later, the Siamese government sent a delegation to the UK to personally ask the King to dismiss his intention to resign. The King proposed conditions for restoration, saying that the previous bill must be approved by a referendum before he would approve it and withdraw his intention to resign. The Siamese government received these conditions and delayed responding. According to The Times, the King has received an informal reply from the Bangkok government, saying that the Siamese parliament has rejected the conditions he proposed. Therefore, the King's abdication is inevitable. If so, Siam will support the King's nephew, Prince Ananda Mahidol, as the heir, but the Prince is only 11 years old. In order to ascend the throne, it is planned to organize a regency council to assist the young monarch until he grows up and personally governs. (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>

<h3>Problem of Setting Up Checkpoints on the Mongolian Border</h3>
<p>The Mongolian Side Demands the Withdrawal of the Sui Army</p>
<p>Currently Being Resolved Through Negotiations</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Most of the territory of the provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan belongs to Mongolia. Since the provinces were reorganized, the boundaries between the Mongolian banners and the county seats have not yet been clearly defined, and the tax collection is also extremely chaotic. Mongolians often collect taxes on goods passing through Mongolian territory, euphemistically calling it a road maintenance fee. In normal times, merchants transporting goods often find this burdensome, but government transportation is protected by the army, so no disputes have arisen. Recently, the issue of setting up checkpoints on the Mongolian border suddenly arose. Due to the extremely low prices of special goods from the Gansu area, there are profits to be made. The authorities of Suiyuan province, engaged in trade and migration, have already transported them many times. The Mongolians, seeing that the authorities of the province are making a lot of profit, became very envious. On February 8th, when a large batch of goods was being transported through Mongolian territory, Mongolian soldiers detained them, forcibly demanding taxes. The authorities of Suiyuan province, upon hearing this, were very dissatisfied and sent two regiments of Wang Jingguo's troops to demand the goods back by force, leading to a dispute. The Mongolian side took the opportunity to raise the issue of setting up checkpoints, while the Suiyuan province strongly opposed it, citing the lack of precedent. This is the cause of the incident.</p>
<p>After this incident occurred, the Suiyuan army and the Mongolian guards confronted each other in the areas of Heishatuo, Wuniwusu, Baiyan Mountain, and Daimiao, and the situation became tense. Both sides sent representatives to Beiping to appeal to their superiors and discuss solutions. The Mongolian representative is Bao Yueqing, and the representative of the Suiyuan provincial government is Shi Huayan, the director of the Suiyuan Reclamation Bureau and the Jin-Sui Reclamation Bureau. The parties involved in this case were originally the Mongolian side and the Suiyuan authorities, but those with ties to Chahar and Suiyuan were also involved. Therefore, in addition to the Mongolian and Suiyuan sides, people related to Chahar province were also involved in the negotiations.</p>
<p>The Mongolian side has two demands: (1) The troops of Wang Jingguo's army that entered Mongolian territory should be withdrawn as soon as possible; (2) Permission should be granted to set up checkpoints on the border between Chahar, Suiyuan, and Mongolia, and to formulate tax collection measures. After several days of negotiations in Beiping, the Suiyuan side indicated that the troop withdrawal could be done. However, regarding the establishment of checkpoints, they said that since there was no precedent, it needed to be considered. However, with mutual tacit agreement, there was room for discussion on granting considerable benefits. In recent days, the opinions of both sides have become closer, but the date of resolution is still far away. Today, Prince De also sent a telegram to his representative in Beiping, Bao Yueqing, stating that the Suiyuan army that invaded Mongolian territory was Wang Jingguo's troops, totaling more than one regiment, stationed in the areas of Heishatuo, Wuniwusu, Baiyan Mountain, and Daimiao, about five or six hundred li from Bailingmiao, forming a triangular encirclement of Bailingmiao. On the Heishatuo side, the Suiyuan army and the Mongolian guards are only about one hundred meters apart. He instructed Bao to visit the Beiping authorities to quickly order the withdrawal to avoid accidents. After receiving the telegram, Bao immediately visited He Yingqin this morning. He was out on official business, so Wang Lun received him instead. After Bao explained his intentions, Wang agreed to forward them. Shi Huayan, the representative of the Suiyuan side, has been extremely busy in Beiping in recent days, contacting all parties. The Suiyuan side's intention is that this matter can be legally and appropriately resolved by the highest military and political authorities in North China in accordance with Article 7 of the Mongolian Local Autonomy Principles passed by the Central Government, which deals with tax revenue. The Beiping authorities are also being extremely cautious about this matter and advocate for a legal and fair resolution. They have already telegraphed the Central Government for instructions. According to Shi Huayan, the relationship between Suiyuan and Mongolia has always been very harmonious. This incident was due to a misunderstanding and is now gradually being resolved. It should not be difficult to resolve. His visit to Beiping is to represent Chairman Fu Zuoyi on other official business and to discuss the issue of setting up checkpoints and collecting taxes on the Mongolian border. He has visited Chairman He and also visited Member Xiao and Representative Bao to exchange views, and there is some progress. It should not escalate. According to Bao Yueqing, the dispute between the Mongolian Political Council and the Suiyuan Provincial Government over the issue of setting up checkpoints is very fierce. The attitude of the Suiyuan Province is quite firm. The Mongolian Political Council, due to its own interests, cannot but fight for it. He visited Chairman He today, but he was out on official business, so Chief of Staff Wang received him instead. He has entrusted Wang to forward Prince De's telegram and requested fair handling. He has been in contact with all parties for several days, but there is no progress, and resolution is still difficult. It is reported that Suo Wang took the Beiping-Baotou bus at 8:00 AM this morning to Datong, then went to Mount Wutai to offer incense. He is scheduled to stay on the mountain for more than ten days before returning to Beiping. Suo Wang is paying close attention to Mongolian affairs. According to him, the issue of setting up checkpoints is extremely important to the interests of the Mongolians, and he hopes that it will be resolved appropriately as soon as possible.

<h3>Song Ziwen and Kong Xiangxi Arrive in Hankou Together</h3>
<p>Kong to Return to Nanjing Immediately; Song to Enter Sichuan</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's arrival in Hankou, military and political authorities from various places have flocked to visit him, report on official duties, and seek instructions. Song Ziwen, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Council, and Kong Xiangxi, Vice-President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, also accepted an invitation by telegram to fly west from Nanjing on the 18th in a Ford aircraft. Li Yuwan, counselor of the Ministry of Finance, and secretaries Chen Kangqi and Chen Fengyi accompanied them. They arrived in Hankou at 3:00 PM. After Song and Kong disembarked, they went to the National Goods Bank to rest. That evening, they went to the Bankers Association to visit Chiang Kai-shek. Zhang Xueliang, director of the Military Affairs Commission, hearing of Song and Kong's arrival in Hankou, crossed the Yangtze River from Wuchang to visit them and hosted a banquet to welcome them. Song and Kong have scheduled to meet with the heads of the national tax agencies at the National Goods Bank on the 1st to inquire about the tax revenue situation and to meet with the presidents of various banks. When Kong disembarked, he also made a statement to reporters, saying, "Chairman Chiang, Member Song, and I are all Standing Committee Members of the National Economic Council, and we have come to consult on important matters and to report on revenue and expenditure to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and to discuss and finalize the new budget for the 24th year. As for the reorganization of Sichuan Province's finances, Commander-in-Chief Liu Fu, [whose courtesy name is] Cheng (of Hunan), decided on the steps to be taken while in Nanjing, with the principle of unified revenue and expenditure. During the reorganization period, the Central Government has decided to subsidize 2.4 million yuan, to be allocated in three installments: 1 million yuan in the first month, 800,000 yuan in the second month, and 600,000 yuan in the third month. A branch of the Central Bank will also be established in Chongqing to provide for regulation. The silver issue is attracting worldwide attention. China has always been a silver-using country. There are no accurate statistics on the amount of silver in storage, but it is approximately 280 million yuan. Last year, the number of exports even reached 280 million yuan. In order to prevent outflow, the government had to adopt a tariff equalization policy. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective. Also, because the Chinese people like to hide silver in cellars, there is very little circulation. Therefore, we have purchased some from London for turnover. In the future, if the people trust the government and deposit their silver in banks, both sides will benefit. Financial relief is a whole problem and should be planned as a whole. As for the ban on prize savings, it is a legitimate demand, and the government will give it serious consideration." He concluded by saying that he would stay in Hankou for a few days before returning to Nanjing and that he would not be entering Sichuan for the time being. Member Song will also stay for a few days before returning to Nanjing. The trip to Sichuan has been decided, but the date of departure has not been set. (28th)</p>
<h3>Sichuan Province Abolishes Military Districts</h3>
<p>All Military, Political, and Financial Agencies to Be Completely Withdrawn</p>
<p>Liu Wenhui Also Returns the Political Power of Ningya</p>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: After the establishment of the new provincial government, Deng Xihou, Yang Sen, Li Jiayu, Luo Wei and other generals have successively returned the areas under their jurisdiction, civilian wealth, and various administrative powers to the provincial government. Tian Songyao also telegraphed Chairman Liu Xiang on the 24th, requesting that officials be sent to take over the political power of the military district, saying in his telegram, "The establishment of the provincial government, the reorganization of Sichuan's administration, is the hope of the military and civilians, and it is my long-cherished wish to complete it as soon as possible. I have already abolished the Political Affairs Office and the Security Office, and the names of all officials and personnel in the resident area's civilian financial agencies have been telegraphed. I am awaiting your government's instructions on the method of receiving the resident area, in order to transfer it. I report this respectfully, and I pray for your consideration. Tian Songyao bows respectfully." Tian has now abolished the military, political, and financial offices, and Liu Wenhui also telegraphed Liu Xiang on the 23rd, saying, "Sichuan's administration has been in disarray, and chaos has continued to this day. Fortunately, with your meritorious service, the red atmosphere has gradually subsided. From now on, we will unify the provincial administration, break up the military districts, and open up a long-term governance situation. This is both the desire of the entire Sichuan province and my long-cherished wish. I have repeatedly received instructions from Your Excellency and Chairman Chiang, which are in line with my long-standing aspirations and should be earnestly followed. I would appreciate it if you could provide detailed instructions on how to unify the administration, so that I can contact you." The evil system of military districts for many years has now been completely eliminated, which is the most gratifying first step for the future of Sichuan's administration. When Deng and Yang first returned power, Liu Xiang praised them for their deep understanding of righteousness and asked the Central Government to reward them. Chiang and Wang, in addition to sending special telegrams of commendation, also presented it to the Political Council by President Wang, requesting the National Government to issue an order of commendation. The other day, Liu replied by telegram to Wang and Chiang, reporting on the situation of compliance with the receipt of political power. The telegram stated, "Upon reading the telegrams, I admire the intention of encouraging and supervising the officials to respect the rule of law. I am deeply grateful. In addition to the 21st Army under Xiang's command, stationed in various counties to handle financial and administrative affairs, officially requesting receipt on the day of the establishment of the provincial government, and discussing the transfer of the previous files for management and clarifying the jurisdiction, Deng, Tian, Yang, Li, Luo, and others have also declared the return of political power, sending officials to receive it, and recording and reporting the names of the county magistrates in each district and county, and have all replied with commendation, and intend to add commissions separately, in order to specialize in responsibility. Now, I am again honored to receive a telegram from the General Commanders, and I will be able to follow the instructions carefully. Once the receipt is completed, I will submit a special report. I hereby present the handling situation in advance." As for the overall financial revenue and expenditure situation in Sichuan, according to Liu Xiang, "In the shortest possible time, we will gradually implement overall planning. The regular expenses of each department will be reviewed and issued monthly by the Governor's Office starting in March."</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>An Unexpected Twist in the Yixing Jailbreak Case</p>
<p>The Gu brothers, Gu Tongsun and Gu Liansun, directors of the Yixing land tax, were arrested and held in the county jail for embezzlement. However, on the night of the 16th of last month, they took advantage of an opportunity to escape. Chu Kaiyao, the county's judicial secretary, had previously acted as a guarantor for the Gus, so after the incident, fearing punishment, he also abandoned his post and fled. Zhong Jingcheng, the county magistrate, detained Chu's wife, Ms. Shao, at the county jail, interrogating her under torture, causing her injuries. Chu's mother, Ms. Xu, immediately telegraphed the Suzhou Higher Court to examine the injuries and also telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government, requesting that Magistrate Zhong be dismissed and arrested for investigation. After receiving Ms. Chu Xu's telegram, the Higher Court instructed Qian Chengjun, the chief prosecutor of the local district court, to handle the matter. Chief Prosecutor Qian, upon receiving the telegram, went to the Yixing County Government at 9:00 AM yesterday (the 1st), accompanied by Secretary Zhang Baodi, Inspector Wang Chengyi, Police Chief Zhu Wanyuan, bailiff Hang Yun, and others, in car No. 613 of the Suzhou fleet to examine the injuries of Ms. Chu Shao for verification and handling.</p>

As for the use of these property donations after collection, in addition to the original amount used previously, the remainder will be used to improve public security facilities. The Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Finance have ordered the county magistrates to be responsible for the investigation and to prepare two copies of the register before April, which should be submitted to the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Finance for verification. Magistrate Yan has already received instructions and will uniformly implement the collection according to the new regulations after the promulgation of these regulations.</p>

(2) Regarding the expansion of fundraising efforts, Magistrate Yan, Yang Hanxi, Cai Jianzhi, and Feng Yunchu were recommended to go to Shanghai to contact various charitable organizations and fellow villagers in Shanghai separately to actively solicit donations. (3) Unpaid donation registers will be issued, and the association will investigate and inform them separately by letter, requesting that the collected donations, together with the donation registers, be sent to the County Chamber of Commerce for collection before March 15th. (4) The Chamber of Commerce has a surplus of 2,416 yuan, 3 jiao, and 7 fen in national salvation funds from various industries. The Shan County Party Department sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce requesting that all of it be used for relief funds. (5) The most severe disaster areas in the county are Jiuli Township in the Fifth District and Hucun Zhaimen Chenjiaqiao Liweng Dongzhuang Yangshuxia Rangcun Xiazhuang Zhangxiang Changbang River and other townships in the Sixth District. With limited relief funds available, priority should be given to the most needy areas. The association will send a letter to the district chief and local figures of the area to come to the city to negotiate proper arrangements.</p>
<p>Strike at Zhangjingqiao Elementary School</p>
<p>At the Fifth High Elementary School in Zhangjingqiao Town, Sixth District, the frequent changes of principals in recent years have negatively impacted education, and students' performance has been declining. Therefore, on the 26th of last month, students' families gathered at the Central Teahouse in the town to discuss measures to encourage improvement. It was decided to hold a welcome meeting for Principal Jiang Zhida and all faculty members at 7:30 PM in order to connect with them. After the meeting, over a hundred family members approached Principal Jiang with a letter requesting him to strive to improve the school's education. However, Principal Jiang ignored their requests despite being asked five times. This incited public anger, and yesterday (the 1st), all the students of the school went on strike. Meanwhile, Pang Yicang, Hu Nianqian, and others submitted a petition to the County Government, County Party Department, and Education Bureau requesting the replacement of Principal Jiang in order to reorganize the school.</p>
<p>Han Guojun of Yangzhou Appeals for Disaster Victims</p>
<p>Due to the drought last autumn, there was no harvest in the 8th and 9th districts of this county. The local spring famine has left farmers without adequate food and clothing, and their fields are barren and unable to be cultivated. Magistrate Ma of the County Government and Provincial Committee Members Wang and Yu have repeatedly appealed and proposed that the Department of Finance allocate 45,000 yuan as aid for work relief. However, the disaster area is vast, and the government's efforts are insufficient to provide universal assistance. It is necessary to seek help from charitable organizations in various regions. Fortunately, the respected elder Han Shilaoren of Taixian is in Yangzhou. In addition to Yun Chu, the local official, dispatching Zhu Ganchan to Shanghai to make contact, Han also personally sent letters to Xu Shiying and Wang Yiting of the Yizhen Association, Hu Huajiang of the Zhongnan Bank, and others to appeal for help.</p>

Unfortunately, due to the thinness of the stakes, the workers used excessive force, causing the stakes to suddenly break yesterday (the 27th) around 1:00 PM, and the workers fell and were injured. Dozens of people were injured, among whom Wang Licai's son fainted at the time, his injuries being the most severe, and his life is in danger. Others also suffered head and limb injuries and are unable to work. However, each family is extremely poor and relies on wages for daily sustenance. The suspension of work due to injuries makes medical treatment even more difficult. It is not known whether there is any appropriate compensation in that area.</p>

<p>Mr. Yu Talks About the Excellent Results of the Inspection in Europe and America</p>
<p>Military Section Xu Tingyao and Others Arrived in Shanghai on the 9th</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the military and transportation inspection group, led by Xu Tingyao and Yu Feipeng, consisting of twenty-two members, was dispatched last year to inspect the military and transportation facilities of various countries in Europe and America. The mission has now been completed. The transportation section, led by Yu Feipeng, consisting of five members, arrived in Shanghai at 10:30 AM yesterday morning on the President Wilson of the Dollar Steamship Company from the United States. As for the military section led by Xu Tingyao, they have already boarded the Conte Rosso of the Italian Line in Italy and are expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 9th. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Welcome from All Circles</p>
<p>The President Wilson, on which Mr. Yu and others were traveling, entered the Songkou Port at 8:30 AM yesterday morning and arrived at the Dollar Wharf in Pudong at 9:30 AM. The welcoming personnel arrived at the wharf at around 9:00 AM, taking the city ferry and the post office's special ferry one after another. They included Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Tang Shixuan, Yang Hu, the director of the Municipal Security Bureau, Wang Zhinan, the secretary, Xu Jinyuan of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, Li Jingzong, the general manager of Eurasia Aviation Corporation, Dai Enji, the general manager of China National Aviation Corporation, Wen Yuqing, the director of the International Telegraph Bureau, Bao Keyong, the director of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, Liu Hongsheng, the general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Bian Peilin, the Shanghai Postmaster, Tao Gongchen, the deputy postmaster, Zhu Kongyang, the former member of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and over two hundred relatives and friends of Mr. Yu and others. China National Aviation Corporation also sent a plane to fly around the ship as it docked, as a gesture of welcome.</p>
<p>Arrival in Shanghai</p>
<p>Those who arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning were the transportation section of the inspection group, including the head of the group, Yu Feipeng, the vice-minister of the Ministry of Transportation, Wei Yifu, the former director of the Postal Department, Wu Baofeng, the former director of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, Chen Xu, an engineer of the Jinpu Railway, and Jiang Chuou of the military section. Jiang also returned with them. Jiang, a military advisor to the National Government, served as a member of the military section. Because his father passed away in his hometown in August of last year, and Jiang's inspection mission had not yet been completed, he could not return home to mourn. Therefore, he is now taking the transportation group home first. After arriving in Shanghai, he will not stay but will immediately rush back to his hometown in Hunan to observe mourning. After Yu and others arrived at the new customs wharf at 10:30 AM and disembarked, they returned to their residences to rest.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu's Remarks</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reporter greeted Mr. Yu on the ship and inquired about the results of the trip. Mr. Yu said that he was tired from the journey and that it was inconvenient to talk in detail on the ship. He arranged to meet with reporters from various newspapers at his private residence at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd. According to what Mr. Yu told reporters on the ship yesterday morning, he and others were sent to inspect various countries in Europe and America. They traveled to countries including Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Russia. They inspected all aspects of transportation facilities in detail. He said he would talk about the inspection process in detail later. However, the results of the trip were excellent. After arriving in Shanghai, he will take a short rest and then go to various transportation agencies for inspection for a week. He is scheduled to enter Nanjing around the 10th and then go to Wuchang to meet with Chairman Chiang. As for the inspection report, it will be compiled soon. There are many things that can be learned from the inspection to reform the country. However, how to start should be discussed in detail before proceeding.</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang's Remarks</p>
<p>According to Jiang Chuou, a member of the military section, he and his colleagues were dispatched to inspect various countries in Europe and America on May 11 of last year. The authorities of each country were able to treat them sincerely, which made the inspection very convenient and appreciated. Various industries in Europe and America are very developed. Regarding the military aspect, the inspection was led by Xu Tingyao, the head of the military section. The results of the inspection showed that the military organizations of each country are different, but they are all making progress every day, especially paying attention to the development of machinery. The progress of the air force is even more admirable and can be used as a reference. He is returning to the country with the transportation section because he is mourning his father's death and will go directly to his hometown to observe mourning.</p>
<p>Joint Banquet</p>
<p>Various transportation agencies in Shanghai, such as Liu Hongsheng of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Dai Enji and Li Jingzong of the China National Aviation Corporation and Eurasia Aviation Corporation, Wen Yuqing of the International Telegraph Bureau, and Bao Keyong of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, are hosting a banquet tomorrow evening to welcome Mr. Yu back from his long trip and to celebrate his return.</p>
<h3>Newly Appointed Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Cai Jinjun, Assumed Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu and Others Gave Instructions to Police Personnel</p>
<p>Cai is Scheduled to be Officially Sworn in on the 4th</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Cai Jinjun, the newly appointed director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, went to the Police Department with Mayor Wu yesterday morning to assume office. Director Cai will go to the Municipal Government on the morning of the 4th of this month to hold an official swearing-in ceremony. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Mayor Accompanied Him</p>
<p>At around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, the Municipal Public Security Bureau first sent the reconnaissance team leader, Mr. Lu Ying, to Mr. Cai's residence at 632 New Asia Hotel to welcome Director Cai. Director Cai then went to Mayor Wu's private residence on Haig Road with team leader Lu to pay his respects to Mayor Wu. After a brief conversation, Mayor Wu accompanied the new Director Cai Jinjun and team leader Lu to the Municipal Public Security Bureau. The bureau deployed additional police from the police brigade at the police department road as security because the new director was coming to the bureau to assume office today. The party and national flags were hung at the entrance, and the military band also stood in the front playground. When Mayor Wu, Director Cai, and others arrived at the bureau, the guards and the police brigade stood at attention and saluted, and the military band played military music. At this time, the former director, Wen Chaoji, had already arrived at the bureau and went outside to greet them and sat down in the director's office.</p>
<p>Successive Speeches</p>
<p>After Mayor Wu, Director Cai, and others talked for a while, they gathered all the staff in the bureau in the playground to give speeches. Mayor Wu spoke first, saying that although Director Wen had only been in office for a few months, Director Wen's ability and diligence had been quite meritorious. Now, due to his weakness, he requested to resign. He could not retain him, so he appointed Director Cai to succeed him. Director Cai has a lot of experience in police affairs and has followed Chairman Chiang for many years. He has a deep understanding of the revolution. The city's police affairs will definitely have a new policy in the future. Then Director Wen spoke, saying that he had been in office for several months. Because it was the winter defense period, he paid extra attention to winter defense during these months. Fortunately, with the cooperation and unity of all colleagues, he was able to pass through it safely. In the future, he hopes that all colleagues will work harder to improve the city's police affairs.</p>
<p>Director Cai's Speech</p>
<p>Today is the first day that I, your brother, have come to the bureau to assume office and start working together with all of you comrades. I am grateful for the leadership of the Mayor and the opportunity to meet with you for the first time. I feel that there are a few points I hope to share with you simply. As everyone knows, Shanghai is the largest city in the country and the center of culture and economy. Therefore, we, the comrades who are responsible for implementing government orders and maintaining social order, have an unusually important responsibility. At the same time, Shanghai is a place where Chinese and foreigners live together and the environment is complex, so it is unusually difficult to handle. Therefore, I hope that all comrades will be determined to dedicate themselves to police affairs and serve the society. In other words, we must be determined to serve the society and not have the concept of making a living. We must dedicate all of our mental and physical strength to our duties. This is the first point. Secondly, we know that the police are responsible for implementing government orders, eliminating public hazards, and increasing social welfare. The so-called "eliminating the wicked and pacifying the good, detecting evil and prohibiting violence" in the past is only a passive and remedial measure after the fact. Our main work is to prevent it in advance, especially to change the social atmosphere, which is an active method. As for how to change the atmosphere, simply put, we must implement the New Life Movement advocated by Chairman Chiang to innovate national life. What is the social atmosphere in Shanghai like? You all know it. I hope that in the future, we will earnestly pay attention to implementing the New Life Movement and lead all citizens to abide by it through the personal practice of all comrades, and then move the citizens of the whole country to implement it from the citizens of Shanghai. This is the second point. Furthermore, there is a saying, "Heaven, Earth, Monarch, Parents, Teacher," which we often hear. Even the common people have tablets for "Heaven, Earth, Monarch, Parents, Teacher." However, many people think it is superstition and do not understand it very well. Little do they know that it contains the philosophy of how to be a person and do things, which is unusually great. Especially those who serve in police affairs should know it even more and should have these conditions. The so-called Monarch is the commander. The superior to the subordinate, the police to the people, are all Monarchs. They must have the demeanor of a Monarch. They must respect, value, and love themselves and set an example. The second is Parents. The police are officials who are close to the people. They must be like fathers and brothers to their children, providing rescue, support, and care. The next is Teacher. They must use the methods of a teacher, patiently persuading and enlightening in various ways. Monarch is self-cultivation, Parents is dealing with others, and Teacher is the method. If we police officers can do this, how can we approach the people, so that the people understand, obey, assist, and we can achieve the police's closeness to the people. At the same time, we can also achieve the highest requirement of turning the people into police. Today, because there is not much time, I will only say it simply. The first is the determination of the goal, the second is the effort to focus, and the third is the working method. As for my past, although I have been serving in senior military agencies following Chairman Chiang for many years, I still feel that I do not have a deep experience in police affairs. Fortunately, under the leadership of Mayor Wu in the past few years, with the efforts of the former directors and all the comrades, we have already achieved very good results, which can be referred to more in the future. I hope that you will share half of your past experience, assist me, be content in your duties, and work together.</p>
<p>Commemorative Photo</p>
<p>After the speeches were finished, Mayor Wu and Director Cai went to the director's office to rest. Director Wen and the former secretary, Sun Pu, the director of the first section, Lin Wenquan, and others first sat in the playground with the bureau staff to take photos to commemorate the occasion. Then Director Wen and others went to the director's office and invited Mayor Wu, Director Cai, and others to take another photo in the playground and dispersed.</p>

<h3>Central and Three Other Banks Decide to Continue to Maintain Interbank Lending</h3>
<p>The City's Financial Circulation is Therefore More Active</p>
<p>Commodity Loans Wait for Minister Kong to Return to Shanghai from Hankou</p>
<p>Confer with Various Banks to Discuss Detailed Measures and Implement Them on a Scheduled Basis</p>
<p>According to the New News Agency, local associations and other organizations, in order to relieve the city's economic depression, have publicly recommended Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Yu Zuoting, and three others to meet with Minister Kong to request that the Central Bank allocate huge sums of money to directly lend to industry and commerce. It is learned that the Ministry of Finance has already issued separate orders to various banks to lend as much as possible to provide relief. The Central and three other banks have decided to continue to maintain lending to the silver and money industries. As for direct lending to industry and commerce, it will wait for Minister Kong to return to Shanghai from Hankou before discussing detailed measures and implementing them on a scheduled basis. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Decision to Maintain Silver and Money Lending</p>
<p>The Central, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications have jointly organized interbank lending to the silver and money industries around the time of the general settlement. They have lent more than seven million yuan one after another, and the city's finances have been adjusted and stabilized. As of yesterday, the borrowers have been returning the loans one after another. Although it is not a small amount, there are still more than four million yuan requesting to be extended for continued borrowing. It is learned that the Central and three other banks, in view of the recent financial situation in the city, which still needs to be adjusted, convened a meeting of the responsible persons of the three banks on the 28th of last month. As a result of the meeting, it was decided to continue to maintain interbank lending to the silver and money industries, allowing for extension. If new customers request lending, it can also be accepted within the possible range, depending on the situation. Therefore, the financial circulation in Shanghai will be more active and stable.</p>
<p>Commodity Loans Wait for Kong to Discuss in Detail</p>
<p>Regarding the request of various groups such as the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to the Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi to order the Central Bank to allocate huge sums of money to directly lend to industry and commerce in order to relieve the decline of various industries, according to the New News Agency reporter, it was learned from the financial circles that Minister Kong, regarding the requests of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and other groups, in addition to the Ministry of Finance issuing separate orders to various banks to lend as much as possible, Minister Kong has expressed that he will order the Central, Bank of Communications, and Bank of China to handle it jointly. However, the Central and three other banks have not yet received this order. According to the bank's statement, regarding commodity loans, they will wait for Minister Kong to return to Shanghai from Hankou after completing his official duties and confer with the authorities of each bank to discuss detailed measures before holding them on a scheduled basis. Fortunately, the Central, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications have decided to continue interbank lending to the silver and money industries. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance has already issued separate orders to various banks to lend as much as possible. Under these circumstances, various industries can continue to interact with relevant banks and money houses based on their past credit. In fact, various industries have received indirect relief.</p>
<p>Handover</p>
<p>After the photo was taken, the new and old directors went through the handover procedures clearly. Mayor Wu excused himself first and was seen off by the new and old directors. Then Director Wen also excused himself, and the bureau staff stood on both sides while the military band played music to send him off. Director Cai also personally saw him off to the gate and said goodbye.</p>
<p>Interview with Police Officers</p>
<p>After Director Wen left, all the bureau chiefs of the various branches and the directors of the police stations stood aside. The new Director Cai Jinjun interviewed them individually in the director's office, inquiring about the situation of the police stations of the various branches and giving detailed instructions. It did not end until noon. The chiefs of the various branches and the directors of the police stations then excused themselves from the new Director Cai Jinjun and returned to their respective bureaus.</p>
<p>Appointment of Secretary</p>
<p>This time, when Director Cai came to the bureau, the original secretary, Sun Pu, was transferred to the position of secretary of the Municipal Government. Therefore, Su Liping, the secretary of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters and acting director of the Office, was appointed to succeed him. Director Su has a lot of experience in police affairs and will definitely be able to assist the new director and provide new suggestions for the city's police affairs in the future. As for Lin Wenquan, the director of the first section, he resigned firmly because he was appointed as the director of the Quartermaster Department of the Headquarters. Director Cai will also appoint someone else soon.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu's Cold Gradually Recovering</h3>
<p>Doctors Advise to Rest and Avoid Fatigue</p>
<p>Decline Guests and Banquets</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Mayor Wu of the city, who had been bedridden for many days due to a flu, has recently recovered from the fever and is gradually recovering. However, the doctors have earnestly advised him to rest and avoid fatigue after the illness. Except for yesterday, when the new Director of the Public Security Bureau, Cai Jinjun, came to the bureau to assume office, and he made an effort to go to give a speech, all guests and banquets have been declined.</p>
<h3>City Security Department and Its Party Department's Cleaning Campaign Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Entire Troop Mobilized</p>
<p>Issuing a Letter to the Citizens</p>
<p>The City Security Department and its Party Department, in order to vigorously implement the New Life Movement, specially launched a cleaning campaign to attract the attention of citizens. It was originally scheduled for February 21, 22, and 23 for three days, separately inside and outside, to carry out internal inspections and sweep thoroughfares. At that time, there was continuous spring rain. The internal inspection was not affected, and it was carried out in accordance with the regulations. However, the external cleaning work was difficult to carry out, resulting in repeated postponements. Until yesterday, the weather was clear and suitable for the promotion of cleaning work. Therefore, the director of the department and Yang Xiaotian, the standing committee member of the party department, specially ordered all the troops and party members to follow the original schedule and mobilize together to sweep the thoroughfares. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Cleaning Situation</p>
<p>Yesterday at 8:00 a.m., all the troops and party members of the department, except for those on duty outside, gathered at the headquarters. The commanders of each district conducted detailed inspections and instructions, in order to make the actions in accordance with the department's regulations, and to achieve the effect of setting an example. Until 9:00 a.m., the troops of each district set off and arrived at the designated areas to carry out sweeping. For a time, brooms and iron shovels flew all over the city, and dust and filth were all put into baskets. The stretcher team put the swept garbage into the garbage cans, and checked whether the garbage cans were clean or not, so they were busy going back and forth. The commanders patrolled back and forth to seek rectification. After the main roads were swept, and still not reaching the stipulated two and a half hours of actual sweeping, they swept the alleys on the left and right, so the work was very complete and meticulous. Those with vast areas were still sweeping until 1:00 p.m., performing their duties.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Propaganda</p>
<p>When the sweeping and stretcher teams performed their duties, the propaganda teams also set out to carry out activities. In addition to distributing propaganda materials, they also carried out oral propaganda, explaining the significance and purpose of the cleaning campaign. The words were concise, eloquent, and aroused the citizens' enthusiasm for cleanliness, achieving great results. For those who had dust and dirt around their residences, the sweeping team swept for them, and the propaganda team persuaded them, so that the citizens were happy to accept the original intention of the cleaning campaign. It was also heard that when the sweeping team swept in front of the citizens' houses, many citizens would also rise up to automatically hold dustpans and brooms to clean up the dust and dirt. This is to promote the masses and transform social customs, and there has been a significant effect in the subtle influence.</p>
<p>Inspection Status</p>
<p>In order to check the results and evaluate the merits, the department and the party department appointed inspectors. Yesterday, they also patrolled the city on time, and gave detailed inspections to the spirit and actions of the team members. According to the inspectors, the sweeping, stretcher, and propaganda work were generally diligent. However, changing customs and habits requires perseverance. Those in power must vigorously implement it without slackening, and the people must also work hard to cooperate.</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>In order to achieve long-term practical results. After the inspectors returned to the department, it was heard that they had prepared a detailed report for the superiors to review. In addition, the director of the department, Yang Xiaotian, who is also a standing committee member, was very concerned about the cleaning campaign that was held. He arrived at the department at 8:00 a.m., and accompanied the deputy director Zeng Zesheng to drive around the city, so the officers and soldiers were more excited, resulting in such achievements.</p>
<p>Letter to the Citizens</p>
<p>Time flies, winter goes and spring comes. Before we know it, the first anniversary of the New Life Movement advocated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has arrived. The frequent national crises in our country in recent years are indeed because the imperial examination cannot catch up with others, but the decline of the inherent virtues and strengths of national survival is also one of the important reasons. This is a fact generally recognized by politicians and scholars in recent years. On the other hand, the lives of our people, whether in terms of "doing" or "surviving", have not kept up with the pace of civilization in this century, causing the backward European and American countries to regard us as barbaric and backward nations. Therefore, every time we negotiate on the international political stage, imperialists always treat us with an attitude of not being worthy to be with them, making us isolated and helpless until we fail. The government of our party, witnessing the difficulties of the times, deeply understands the origins of the national crisis. Therefore, in recent years, the implementation of education has focused on the cultivation of scientific talents as the forerunner of national construction. This is what Mr. Wu Zhihui meant by catching up head-on. However, this is only one of the political reforms in our country. To put it bluntly, it is only one of the developments of material civilization in our country, but dare not say that she can save our nation. To be honest, our country has been working hard to cultivate scientific talents since the Zeng Guofan era in the late Qing Dynasty. For decades, it has remained the same. Why can't it still save the country? Nothing else, forgetting the cultivation of the spirit. Let's look at the Meiji Restoration in Japan. He certainly extremely accepted Western scientific knowledge. Similarly, he thoroughly retained the spirit of their Yamato soul. Because he can advance both idealism and materialism, he succeeded, while we only focus on one aspect, so we failed. This is a very obvious fact, placed in front of us. After the victory of suppressing the communists, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek deeply understood the political illnesses of our country, which are due to the lack of a complete policy, resulting in a crippled scene of treating the head when it hurts and treating the feet when it hurts. Therefore, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has the supreme truth of three parts military and seven parts politics in his political theory of suppressing the communists, and the advocacy of the New Life Movement in the practice of the national rejuvenation movement. The advocacy and implementation of the New Life Movement has been a year in a flash. Have the citizens of Shanghai often reflected on whether their lives violate the creeds of the New Life Movement? Going a step further, we should assess whether our cultivation of the four virtues of propriety, justice, integrity, and shame is now worthy. At the same time, we should also review our four items of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and whether we have reached the creeds of cleanliness, neatness, simplicity, and simplicity. The citizens of Shanghai, because of their superior environment, not only bear the heavy responsibility of modern culture and economy in our country, but also are representatives of our citizens in the international community. Everyone is watching, and if the way of life is not restrained, it will be ridiculed by friendly countries, which will not only leave shame on our nation, but also hinder the opportunity for our national rejuvenation. Only by climbing high can we humble ourselves, and by traveling far, we must start from near. Do not fail to do something because it is small, and do not fail to change something because it is too detailed. Therefore, I deeply hope that the citizens of Shanghai will measure their heavy responsibility, strive to improve the New Life Movement, adhere to the principle of humility, understand the effectiveness of details, and gradually progress towards the inner cultivation of the four virtues. However, what are the humble creeds of the New Life Movement? In short, cleanliness, neatness, and order are also. If we can be clean, neat, and orderly in all aspects of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, then habit becomes nature, and we can unconsciously reach the level of modern civilization. Then, the disapproving eyes of European and American countries on our nation can naturally be transformed. Today, on the occasion of the first anniversary of the New Life Movement, I will hold a cleaning campaign with my citizens. In all aspects of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, we should always pay attention to cleanliness, neatness, and order, so as to keep pace with modern civilization. However, over time, people's feelings are normal. I hope that the citizens of Shanghai, who bear heavy responsibilities, will uphold the spirit of making persistent efforts, remove the conservatism of keeping the old, and also cultivate themselves and persuade others. If we follow the example of the spring breeze blowing on the earth, and hundreds of flowers bloom, then it is only a matter of time to change customs and habits and transform all things. However, this kind of thing cannot be accomplished by one person's strength. Everyone must be like an army, advancing and retreating in unison, to be successful. I hope everyone will work hard.

<p>Central News Agency reports that the government is paying unusual attention to the auction of Shenxin's Seventh Factory.

After receiving the order, the Central Bank convened a meeting the night before to discuss relief measures. According to attendees of the meeting, the relief measures have been agreed upon at the meeting, that is, to petition the government to provide relief. This measure was reported to Minister Kong by telegram that night and must be implemented after Minister Kong's approval.

<p>Chen Has Been Investigating in Shanghai for Several Days</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned that Mr. Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry, has been extremely concerned about the Shenxin Textile Seventh Factory incident since he arrived in Shanghai. He has personally investigated the factory's debt situation for several days in order to find ways to provide relief and maintain the future of our yarn industry. As of yesterday, Chen believed that although HSBC was fulfilling the treaty, its actions were obviously illegal. Moreover, the nationalities of the debtor and the creditor were different, and he decided to negotiate and strive for it based on reason.</p>
<p>The Mayor's Private Residence Discussed Relief</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng received an order from the Executive Yuan to find a way to negotiate the Shenxin factory matter. At the same time, Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry, received telegrams from various groups and came to Shanghai the other day to discuss rescue measures with the municipal government. After meeting with Mayor Wu, he believed that there was still hope for the redemption of the factory, but with economy as the focus, he invited leaders of the financial community, Zhang Gongquan, Chen Xing, Li Fusun, Chen Guangfu, Tang Shoumin, and Secretary-General of the Municipal Government Yu Hongjun to discuss remedial measures at Mayor Wu's residence on Haig Road at noon yesterday, which lasted for a long time.</p>
<p>HSBC Expressed That It Can Be Recovered</p>
<p>The HSBC Bank authorities, in view of the tense national sentiment of our country, have changed their attitude towards this matter in recent days. According to more reliable news, the attitude of Mr. He Quemen, the manager of HSBC Shanghai, is very forgiving of Shenxin. He Quemen has unofficially expressed to the parties concerned that if Shenxin can find a way, HSBC will not embarrass it because of the close Sino-British relations in the past. A reporter from Hua Dong News Agency visited Gong Ziyu, the Chinese comprador of the bank, yesterday and was told that he had not heard about the ins and outs of the matter, so he did not know the details. He vaguely heard that all sectors had actively sought assistance. If all parties were sincere, HSBC might withdraw the auction.</p>
<p>The Buyer's Lawyer Did Not Pay Yesterday</p>
<p>The representatives of a certain party who bid to buy Shenxin's Seventh Factory, Okamoto and Murakami, were scheduled to pay yesterday. However, according to Okamoto, who told a reporter from Hua Dong News Agency yesterday, because HSBC and Shenxin still have disputes, the date of payment should be awaited. As for when to pay, it depends on when HSBC can transfer the goods (referring to Shenxin's Seventh Factory). The reporter then asked who the buyer was, and Okamoto still laughed without answering as he did at the auction.</p>
<p>Various Groups Jointly Petitioned Yesterday</p>
<p>Since Shanghai Shenxin Yarn Factory's Seventh Factory was illegally auctioned by HSBC Bank, all groups in this city have been indignant. At 10:00 a.m. yesterday, Zhang Zilian of the National Goods Factory Federation, Zhou Xuexiang of the General Labor Union, Qian Chengxu of the China Industrial Federation, Chen Binghui of the China National Products Manufacturers Federation, Wang Jiean and Lu Xingzhuang of the Citizens' Promotion of National Goods Association, and Zhu Wenqi of the Machine Dyeing and Weaving Association jointly petitioned Mayor Wu of the Municipal Government. Because the mayor had not recovered from his cold, Secretary Guo received them on his behalf. First, the representatives of each group stated the process of Shenxin's Seventh Factory being auctioned by HSBC Bank. If the property rights are transferred, it will be more difficult to negotiate. Therefore, they hoped to request the central government to allocate the current funds of 2.25 million yuan to pay back the HSBC overdue funds. Otherwise, empty talk will be useless. With material assistance, the national sovereignty will not be damaged, and domestic industries will be supported and developed by the government. Secretary Guo promised to convey the above situation to the mayor and submit it to the central government for approval. The representatives then left.</p>
<p>Daily News Hopes Okamoto Will Handle It Well</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun said that since the auction of Shenxin's Seventh Factory, it has suddenly caused a great shock in society. The Chinese side has sent urgent telegrams one after another, and various groups are extremely激越. Public opinion is also quite strong. The trend is expanding day by day. However, the representative of the buyer, Okamoto, has not revealed the truth, so people from all countries have speculation. Because Okamoto is Japanese, all parties said that its background is a Japanese trading company. Such delay will only stimulate the nerves of the Chinese people and people from various countries, and Dalian Steamship and South Manchuria Railway Company will be greatly confused. Therefore, there are various obstacles in the progress of the matter, and other Japanese stores are also adversely affected in transactions. At the time of the change in Sino-Japanese relations, in the complex and subtle relationship of the international situation in the Far East, I am afraid it is not limited to the small yarn factory problem. If you are not careful, it is difficult to avoid other dangerous international problems. We Japanese people deeply hope that Lawyer Okamoto will consider it carefully and handle it well. At the very least, we should also clarify the Japanese side's position. Long night and many dreams, what will be the result, it is quite noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Formulates Measures for Checking Telegrams</h3>
<p>In order to make all sectors understand the situation of checking telegrams and to speed up the transmission of telegrams, the Ministry of Communications has formulated a measure for checking telegrams and distributed it to Chinese and foreign newspaper offices and various firms for reference and implementation. The details of the measure are recorded as follows: (1) The Ministry of Communications, in accordance with the government's special powers, designates telegraph offices or radio stations in important cities (hereinafter referred to as bureau stations) to send personnel to perform the duties of checking various telegrams. When necessary, the above inspection matters should be handled in consultation with local party, government, military, and public security agencies.

(3) The telegram shall not contain words that endanger the party and the country, harm public security, are similar to rumors, or leak military and diplomatic secrets. (4) All local Chinese people who send domestic and foreign secret business telegrams in the places designated by the Ministry to check telegrams, if the sender is a reputable firm, should affix the firm's stamp on the bottom of the telegram and sign a guarantee from the manager before it can be sent. The style of this stamp and signature should be sent to the bureau station in advance for record. When necessary, the secret book must still be submitted for inspection. Other people who send secret business telegrams should record the words represented by the password on another piece of paper and send it to the bureau station for inspection along with the telegram. (5) Foreign overseas Chinese who send domestic and foreign secret business telegrams in the places designated by the Ministry to check telegrams should first have the consul in the place of residence issue a letter stating that they are responsible before they can be sent. Otherwise, the consulate should affix a stamp on the bottom of the telegram to guarantee it. However, when necessary, the secret book must still be submitted for inspection. If there is no consul of that country in the local area, then record the words represented by the password on another piece of paper and send it to the bureau station for inspection along with the telegram.

(9) The sender and recipient of the telegram may inquire about the detained or deleted telegram from the original sending and receiving office, but they may not directly inquire from the inspectors. (10) The deleted telegrams should be kept strictly confidential by the inspectors and the bureau station, except for the bureau station to notify the sender on a weekly basis. (11) News telegrams shall not contain codes with unclear meanings.

<h3>The Municipal Government Arrested Rumor-Mongering Bandits</h3>
<p>Has Been Sent to the Garrison Headquarters for Interrogation</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that there is an excess of housing in the concessions of this port, but the rent is still unwilling to fall. In general, real estate companies are anxious because of the space in the houses. There are even unscrupulous people who, in view of the fact that during the previous unrest in the local area, the houses in the concessions could be used to live in, so they did not care to fabricate all kinds of unfounded rumors, causing the people in the Zhabei area of this city to be unusually uneasy. There are quite a few people who are looking for houses in the concessions to move to. The Shanghai Municipal Government secretly ordered its subordinates a few days ago to strictly arrest people who create rumors and cause trouble and severely punish them. It was heard that two rumor-mongering bandits were arrested near Yokohama Bridge in Zhabei yesterday and have been sent to the garrison headquarters for interrogation and will be dealt with by military law.</p>

<h3>The Sino-British Pharmacy Declares Closure Yesterday</h3>
<p>Inventory Pile-up Causes Financial Difficulties</p>
<p>Accountant Xie Lin Appointed to Handle Liquidation</p>
<p>According to Dagongshe, the Sino-British Pharmacy Co., Ltd., located at 406-408 Nanjing Road, has been operating for over 50 years, and its business has been known to be thriving. However, recently, due to the impact of the economic downturn, it suddenly declared its closure yesterday morning. Accountant Xie Lin has been appointed as the representative to handle the liquidation and notify all creditors to attend a meeting scheduled for March 3rd at the Daya Lou Restaurant on the Fourth Road. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for Closure</p>
<p>A reporter visited the liquidator of the pharmacy, accountant Xie Lin. According to him, the reason for the closure is due to excessive purchases. Affected by the economic downturn, sales have been sluggish, resulting in inventory pile-up and inability to liquidate. Outstanding debts are being urgently demanded. As a result, financial difficulties arose and could not be remedied, leaving no choice but to temporarily suspend business. The reporter then inquired whether there was a possibility of resuming business like Jicheng. He replied that it would depend on the outcome of the creditors' meeting. The meeting is scheduled for the 3rd of this month at Daya Lou, and notices have already been sent out.</p>
<p>Past History</p>
<p>The pharmacy was founded with capital raised by Mr. Zhang Xianda, who served as the manager himself. It has been in operation for over 50 years. During the early years of the Guangxu era, when Western medicine was still in its infancy, the pharmacy was well-managed and expanded gradually. To date, the actual paid-up capital is 100,000 yuan, and it is a limited liability company. It has registered with the Ministry of Industry and obtained a license in accordance with the Company Law. Manager Zhang is an experienced veteran in the Western medicine industry. However, despite his skills, he was unable to cope with the current economic downturn and had to declare the business closed. It is said that the total debt is less than 100,000 yuan, but the number of creditors is not small. There are concerns that financial resources are exhausted and collection will be difficult.</p>
<p>Liquidation Notice</p>
<p>Accountant Xie Lin announces on behalf of the company: It is hereby notified that the Sino-British Pharmacy Co., Ltd. has stated that due to the impact of the economic downturn, the shareholders have resolved to temporarily suspend business and entrust this accountant to discuss solutions with the creditors. A creditors' meeting is scheduled for March 3rd at the Daya Lou Restaurant on the Fourth Road. All creditors are requested to attend the meeting on time to discuss everything. Your presence is highly anticipated. This notice is hereby given.</p>

<h3>Autopsy Results of Japanese Family Cook</h3>
<p>Pus Accumulation in the Brain and Back</p>
<p>Determined to Have Died of Illness Before Death</p>
<p>Zhang Asheng, a 34-year-old man from Tongzhou, was a cook at the Donghua brothel and liquor store owned by a Japanese man at No. 23, Lane 173, Zhapu Road. On the evening of the 23rd of last month, after being beaten by his Japanese colleague, Huiichi Mizuta, he was bedridden. After being reported to the Hongkou Police Station, they sent an investigator to take Zhang to the hospital. The rescue was ineffective, and he died on the day before yesterday. The body was taken to the autopsy office on Feilun Road. The day before yesterday morning, Tang, a prosecutor appointed by the First Special District Court, arrived at the office. After an examination, it was not possible to determine the cause of death from the outside, so he ordered the forensic doctor to perform an autopsy to clarify the truth. According to reports, the forensic doctors Wei and Zhang performed an autopsy on the body on the day before yesterday afternoon. As a result, it was discovered that the deceased had pus accumulation in the brain and back, which led to his death. It was determined that the death was due to illness. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special Court, visited the autopsy office. First, he informed Xu Shunqing, the Chinese head of the police station in charge of the autopsy process, and then summoned the deceased's father, Zhang Shun'en, for questioning. Mr. Guo said that the autopsy confirmed that Zhang Asheng, a male, died of illness before death. The body was handed over to the deceased's father, Zhang Shun'en, who signed a guarantee to take it back for burial.</p>

<h3>Kidnappers in Wang Boying Case Scheduled for Sentencing</h3>
<p>Female Bandit Wants to Take Her Child to Jail</p>
<p>Wang Cai's Asks for Custody</p>
<p>Wang Boying, a director of the Great Eastern Book Company, was kidnapped by bandits on the night of February 9 at the entrance of Changfeng Lane, Tongfu Road, and a ransom of 200,000 yuan was demanded. Feng Baishun, the detective of Chengdu Road Police Station, detectives Cui Chengke and Huang Fusen, and others successively arrested the kidnappers Wang Liugen, Wang Cai's, Ma Shenzhong, Hu Amao, and suspect Wang Zhengguo, Yang Kong's, and others, rescued the victim, and sent them to the First Special Court. After several interrogations, Yang Kong's was released first, and Zhang Zhengguo was released on 1,000 yuan bail. The others were remanded in custody. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui of the Criminal Division 8 continued a brief interrogation. Because the facts were clear, he ordered the debate to begin. Then, the police station lawyer Zhang Tianyin and the defendant Zhang Zhengguo's lawyer Wu Linkun, and Ma Shenzhong's lawyer Wu Peng, and others, stood up to debate successively. After a long time, the debate was completed. At the end, the wife of Zhang Yisheng, an employee of a certain newspaper, claimed that the defendant Wang Cai's was formerly the wife of her younger brother. Later, her younger brother died of illness, leaving a child, who is now held by Wang Cai's. She inquired that her younger brother had only raised this child before his death, so she requested permission to take custody of the child in order to continue the family line. She presented a photo of her younger brother and Wang Cai's as evidence. However, Wang Cai's insisted on raising the child in prison herself, until the child could walk, before handing it over. Judge Liu ordered the debate in the case to be concluded and scheduled the sentencing for Friday morning next week. Zhang Zhengguo was still released on the original bail, and the others were remanded in custody. As for the issue of custody of the child, it will be reviewed at the time of sentencing.</p>
<h3>Young Couple's Dispute: Judge Persuades Them to Reconcile</h3>
<p>Urging Both Parties to Think About the Consequences</p>
<p>Hoping That They Will Withdraw the Charges at the Next Hearing</p>
<p>Zhou Defang, the 19-year-old second son of Zhou Bingchen, the former owner of the Sanxing Stage from Ningbo, currently resides at No. 12, Anyi Lane, Seymour Road. On the tenth day of the first lunar month of the sixteenth year of the Republic, he married Ge Lijun (19 years old), a woman from the same hometown, through a matchmaker. Ge is beautiful and well-educated, and Zhou is also a handsome young man, so their marital bliss was greater than drawing eyebrows. They have now raised two sons. However, recently, their relationship has suddenly deteriorated. Ge has returned to her mother's house at No. 37, Jixian Lane, Youheng Road, Ningdong, and has hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court against Zhou Defang for separation and maintenance, requesting payment of 50,000 yuan for living expenses. The reasons for her request for separation are abuse and the defendant's suffering from a serious illness, etc. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhang Qinglan of the Civil Division 4 of the First Special Court summoned him. In addition to submitting a written defense, Zhou Defang also hired lawyer Yuan Yang'an to defend him. The reason for his defense is that since his father, Zhou Bingchen, failed in business and planned to sell the residence in Yanghe Lane, Xinzha Road, and move to another place to save expenses, the plaintiff was extravagant and unwilling to live a simple life. She demanded that the defendant ask his father for 50,000 yuan to set up a small family separately. Because his father had failed in business, where would he get such a large sum? He婉言拒絶 (婉言拒絶) refused politely, and the plaintiff suddenly had a change of heart. She packed all the defendant's furs, clothing, etc., worth about 5,000 yuan, into ten leather suitcases and moved them to her mother's house. The defendant had no clothes to wear and asked his wife's family for them, but they were all rejected. He had reported it to the police, but now he is falsely accusing him and requesting that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. Judge Zhang first asked the plaintiff about the situation of being unable to live together. She said that since marrying the defendant, she has had two sons, who are currently being raised in the defendant's home. The defendant goes out and has affairs from time to time, and does not return all night. If she tries to persuade him, she is beaten. In December of the year before last, the defendant had a relationship with a prostitute named Fang Qing Lao Jiu from the Huile Lane brothel in room 409 of the China Hotel. I caught them, hoping that the defendant could change his mind, but he became even more excessive. When I asked the defendant when he didn't return, he replied that he was sleeping with a prostitute in Fuxiang Lane without any concern. In June of last year, the defendant contracted a venereal disease, and I was also infected. I was cured by a doctor. In July, because I couldn't bear the beatings, I attempted suicide with opium. I was rescued by first aid. On January 9 of this year, there was an argument again because the defendant returned late, and I was beaten. I reported it to the Gordon Road Police Station. Because of the marital relationship, I was told to file a lawsuit in court myself. In this situation, I can no longer live with him. Zhou Defang said in his defense that because my father's business failed, the plaintiff asked me to ask my father for 50,000 yuan. Her claims that I patronize prostitutes, stay with prostitutes, beat her, and take poison are all false and completely fabricated. I do not agree with the plaintiff's request for separation, and I am unable to pay the requested alimony. Lawyer Yuan said that both parties in this case are young people. According to the defendant's father, Zhou Bingchen, he is eager for both parties to continue living together. Today, he originally planned to bring the two sons born by the plaintiff to the court, so that the plaintiff could feel the love of her children, or could calm down and make peace. He was afraid that they would cry incessantly, so he did not bring them. However, reconciliation is the best solution in this case. Judge Zhang said that he originally intended to persuade them to reconcile, so he earnestly persuaded both parties and told them about the various advantages and disadvantages. Because it could not be resolved immediately, he ordered the postponement to March 16 to allow both parties to think about the consequences and calm their anger, hoping that they would withdraw the charges and not meet in court again before the next hearing.</p>

<h3>The Rickshaw Association Advises Rickshaw Owners to Actively Introduce Rickshaw Pullers to Register</h3>
<p>But the Rickshaw Pullers Oppose, So the Result Is Still Not Enthusiastic</p>
<p>The Association Reports to the Rickshaw Committee for Handling</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She, the Public Concession Engineering Bureau Rickshaw Committee previously requested the Engineering Bureau's board of directors to correct the situation because rickshaw puller registration was not enthusiastic. Gu Songmao, a standing committee member of the Rickshaw Association Special District Office, said that rickshaw puller registration has been repeatedly advised by the association to rickshaw owners to order rickshaw pullers to register. However, one reason is that the rickshaw pullers themselves expressed dissatisfaction with the registration, and another group of rickshaw pullers claimed that the association controlled the rickshaw owners and forced rickshaw pullers to register because the association advised them to introduce rickshaw pullers to register. Therefore, yesterday morning, they went to various rickshaw owners to earnestly advise them to actively introduce rickshaw pullers to register to avoid losses in their own business. However, when passing by Yixin Tea Garden on Guoqing Road, some rickshaw owners inside said that the reasons for the rickshaw pullers' opposition to registration were vaccination, taking small photos, and fingerprinting, so the rickshaw owners could not advise them any further. Now, the association has truthfully reported to the Rickshaw Committee for handling.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Owners Overcharging Rickshaw Rent</h3>
<p>The Rickshaw Committee Withholds Licenses</p>
<p>The rickshaw rent for public rickshaws in the Public Concession has been stipulated by the Engineering Bureau as 78 cents per day, plus the rickshaw puller mutual aid society donation collected on behalf of the pullers, totaling 85 cents per day. However, according to the Rickshaw Affairs Committee's investigation, some rickshaw owners are still overcharging the rent, in violation of the regulations. After the committee questioned five rickshaw owners concerned, they did not provide satisfactory explanations. Therefore, it was decided to withhold a total of fifteen vehicle licenses for one month or two months each to show punishment.</p>

<h3>Fu Tong Institute Constructs School and Factory Buildings</h3>
<p>Benefiting Helpless Beggar Children</p>
<p>Since the completion of the new building of the Fu Tong Institute in Yokohama Bridge, North Sichuan Road, Shanghai last year, the institute's directors Zhao Jinqing, Li Denghui, Wu Xiaogu, Mrs. Li Guansen, Mrs. He Linyi, Mrs. Guo Bingwen, and others have been working actively and tirelessly. As a result, they have gained the approval of Chinese and Western people in the community, and visitors have been coming in an endless stream. Currently, the number of beggar children received by the institute has been continuously increasing, causing the original buildings to be insufficient. They are planning to construct another school and factory building so that the beggar children in the institute can work separately, and they will派工闢路 (派工闢路) send workers to build roads next to the building to facilitate transportation. The general director, Cai Shoudao, is currently working on this. It is reported that since its establishment more than a year ago, the past achievements have been well handled. Currently, Fu Tong children Zhang Shinian, 9 years old, from Ningbo, was taken in opposite the Xinxin Company on Nanjing Road, and has been adopted as a godson by Mr. Shen from Fenghua. Huang Gengsheng, 15 years old, from Chongming, was taken in on the Bund of the Great World and has been at the institute for more than a year, and has also been taken in as an apprentice by the Huachang Ink Factory. Their actions to benefit the beggar children are truly not shallow.</p>
<h3>International Telegrams Reduced in Price Yesterday</h3>
<p>Franc Exchange Rate Changed to 95 Cents</p>
<p>International telegram fees have always been denominated in gold francs. When charging fees, Chinese telegram offices have always converted the franc into Chinese silver dollars in advance. When the telegraph office charges fees, it uses this silver dollar exchange rate to charge. It is learned that because of the fall in silver prices, the telegraph office has reduced the silver dollar exchange rate of the franc, which has been implemented since yesterday. This time, the silver dollar exchange rate of the franc was reduced from one yuan to 95 cents per franc. For example, the ordinary telegram sent to Europe costs 3.45 yuan per word, but now it only costs 3.30 yuan.</p>
<h3>French Concession Authorities Strictly Deny Rumors of Opening Gambling Houses</h3>
<p>Recently, a bizarre rumor has spread in this city, claiming that someone in the French Concession is active in opening gambling houses. These are baseless rumors. It is learned that the administrative policy adopted by the French Concession authorities remains the same as before, and the regulations and current laws decided by the French Municipal Council will be absolutely strictly enforced, without any other changes. It is learned that the French authorities will publish a notice in the newspaper to reassure all parties, stating that the rumors are untrue.</p>
<h3>Foreign Russian Staff of the Engineering Bureau Make Progress in Learning Chinese</h3>
<p>Foreign staff members belonging to the Engineering Bureau are required to learn Chinese, which is taught by the Chinese Language Office of the Bureau. Non-field staff can also attend classes. Since last year, the office has been working hard to reform, focusing on teaching efficiency and improving the treatment of teachers. The number of teachers has been reduced from 80 five years ago to 35. Among them, two teachers serve as supervisors. After this reform, the atmosphere has changed greatly. Among the students last year, whether they were learning Shanghai language or Beijing language, they all made significant progress and were able to pass the examination within the prescribed time. The Chinese Language Office is also responsible for the translation of documents within the Engineering Bureau. One group is responsible for translating English into Chinese, and the other group is responsible for translating Chinese into English. All Chinese letters sent to the Engineering Bureau, as well as the Engineering Bureau's gazettes and annual reports, are properly translated by the office.</p>
<h3>Mr. Huang Jizhi from Xiangshan Passed Away</h3>
<p>Mr. Huang Jizhi from Xiangshan has lived in Shanghai for several decades. He started his career with Confucian arts and later changed his career to commerce, engaging in shipping. He founded Taigu Jiji in Shanghai for more than 30 years. Taigu 洋行 (洋行) matters, large and small, are mostly consulted before proceeding. In his later years, he lived at home and recuperated, enjoying books and history in his daily life, and collected many bronzes and stone inscriptions. He once published a series of academic books of the Qing Dynasty. The books of Yan Xizai, Jiao Litang, Dai Zigao, Zheng Ziyin, and others are mostly circulated thanks to him. The manuscripts of Chao Junchao's Diaogualou Collection are all stored in his home, and are especially called rare books in the country. Unfortunately, Mr. Huang suddenly passed away on the 26th of this month. The business community and scholars deeply mourn him. The funeral is scheduled for 1 p.m. on March 3rd at the International Cemetery on Hongqiao Road. At that time, there will be a grand scene of plain carriages and white horses.</p>
<h3>Female Tea Room Attendant No. 1 of Dajing Class in Xinxin Amusement Park Assassinated</h3>
<p>Husband Out Working, Woman Alone at Home</p>
<p>A Young Man Came and Went Hurriedly, Then She Was Strangled</p>
<p>Xu Meiying, a young woman from Jiangwan, 28 years old, used to be a worker in a silk store. Five years ago, she became acquainted with Gu Xiaodi (30 years old this year), a coppersmith from Suzhou, and lived together. Recently, they moved to the front room on the third floor of Yuanshenchang Porcelain Store at No. 88, Father Kim Road, in the French Concession. Gu works as an auto mechanic at Yuanheng Auto Repair Company at No. 744, Lafayette Road. The woman has been a hostess No. 1 at the Dajing Class of the rooftop amusement park of the Xinxin Company for two years. Yesterday morning, Gu, as usual, went to work at Yuanheng Auto Repair Company after getting up. Ms. Xu was alone at home. At about 9 o'clock, a man identified as 甲 (Jia), about 30 years old and wearing a short coat, came to Gu Xiaodi's house. He went downstairs in about five minutes. In about two or three minutes, he returned to Gu's house. He did not go downstairs until 10 o'clock and left with a swagger. At noon, at about 12 o'clock, Gu Xiaodi returned home for lunch and went upstairs. He heard no movement from his wife. When he stepped into the room, he saw that his wife Meiying had been strangled and was lying face up on the floor. She was wearing a single short shirt and short pants. It was deduced that the woman was still asleep when she was attacked. She was strangled with her pants belt. There were claw marks on her chest and tooth marks on her right buttocks. Bloodstains were obvious. A double silk gold bracelet weighing more than one or two, a gold thread ring, a gemstone ring, and a square seal ring that she was wearing on her hand were all taken away by the murderer. He was shocked and asked the people living together. Because Gu lived alone in the front room on the third floor, and the back room was a porcelain warehouse, the residents downstairs had difficulty hearing any movement. According to Wang Nianzu (27 years old, from Wuxi), the second landlord, who is the owner of Yuanshenchang Store, a man came and went in a hurry. Gu immediately reported to the French Police Station, who sent investigators to investigate and took flash photos in the room for investigation. The body was sent to Tongren Fuyuan Branch Autopsy Office for examination. Today, they will report to the Second Special Court to send someone to examine the body. The police station has ordered its investigators to strictly arrest the fugitive murderer and bring him to justice. According to the speculation of the general public, because the deceased was a hostess, it is presumed that it was a murder for passion.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Requests the Jianghai Customs to Waive the Appeal Bond</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to the Jianghai Customs Tax Affairs Department, stating: "Regarding the matter, on the 28th of this month, we received a letter from the Chaozhou Sugar and Sundries Trade Association, stating that their member, Wenmao Trading Company, reported that they have a joint venture called Xingye Trading Company. On November 14th of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, they received 300 bags of GV brand white sugar cakes from a Hong Kong customer via the Qiongzhou Wheel, and they had already declared and paid taxes according to regulations. On November 19th of the same month, they also transported 180 bags of the same sugar cakes via the Taiyuan Wheel, and they had also declared and inspected them completely. Suddenly, the Jianghai Customs claimed that the above sugar cakes had concealed tax evasion issues. In addition to paying the supplementary tax, they also wanted to impose a guarantee deposit of 10,500 national currency yuan before allowing the case to be transferred to the higher-level appeal. Otherwise, the goods would be confiscated, etc. According to Article 33 of the Customs Anti-Smuggling Regulations promulgated by the National Government on June 19th of the 33rd year, it is stipulated that in cases where a person declares dissatisfaction, if the declarant is at risk of absconding or if execution is obviously difficult, the declarant may be ordered to provide a guarantee deposit. In this case, the declarant is a legitimate business in Shanghai and has no risk of absconding. Moreover, the goods have been detained in the warehouse. According to the litigation rules of the court, the litigation costs that the parties should pay may be reduced or exempted if the litigant's ability is insufficient, so that the people can truly receive legal protection. Now that our company is under the protection of your esteemed association, and its joint venture is facing such a difficult situation, we should request that you write to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to swiftly forward the request to the Jianghai Customs Tax Affairs Department, asking them to consider the difficulties of the business and allow Xingye Trading Company's appeal case to be exempted from paying the guarantee deposit, so that it can be transferred to a higher-level agency for appeal, thereby providing relief, etc. Based on this, we have found that Xingye Trading Company is a legitimate business with well-known credit, not a group of small vendors who engage in fraud and move around without a fixed address. Moreover, since the goods have already been detained, they are sufficient as material collateral. Regarding the payment of the appeal guarantee deposit, we can liberally exempt them. Based on the previous situation, we should write to your association, based on the situation, and forward it to the Jianghai Customs Tax Affairs Department, asking them to treat the guarantee deposit that Xingye Trading Company should pay for the appeal as an exemption, in order to show consideration, which is truly fair, etc., arriving at the association. We have checked that the Ministry of Finance issued Instruction No. 6530 of the Customs Department in July of last year, which issued the Customs Anti-Smuggling Regulations. Article 33 states that in cases where a person declares dissatisfaction in accordance with the preceding two articles, if the declarant is at risk of absconding or if execution is obviously difficult, if the punishment is a fine, the declarant may be ordered to provide a guarantee deposit, which the Customs Tax Affairs Department will temporarily keep. In this case, the party concerned has Wenmao Trading Company set up in Shanghai, and there are also joint ventures in addition to this. There is no reason for them to abandon their store and flee on their own. Moreover, there are still detained goods in the warehouse that can be disposed of. Even when it comes to the time of final execution, there will be no difficulty in execution. Since there is no situation described in that article, according to the regulations, there is no reason to order them to provide a guarantee deposit. Accordingly, we are writing to your esteemed Tax Affairs Department to investigate and hope that you will approve the exemption of the guarantee deposit in this case. We will immediately forward the company's statement of objection. If your esteemed Tax Affairs Department does not agree with our association's interpretation of the above regulations, then this case involves the interpretation of the guarantee deposit in the Anti-Smuggling Regulations, and only the Ministry of Finance can make the final decision. Our association has now submitted a request to the Ministry for instructions. Before the Ministry makes a decision, please suspend the execution of the unfinalized case and retain the right to forward their statement of objection in order to protect the legitimate appeal rights of merchants. We hereby declare this jointly."</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Requests Clarification on the Doubtful Points of Foreigners Performing Pilotage</h3>
<p>Performing Pilotage Business in the Interior</p>
<p>Is Not Permitted by International Law</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to the Shanghai Pilotage Management Committee, stating: "Regarding the matter, on the 28th of this month, we received a letter from our member, the Shanghai Shipping Trade Association, which was reorganized according to law from the Shipping Association, stating that, according to the joint statement of various member companies, since the government established the Pilotage Management Committee and issued new regulations on pilotage fees, shipping companies have many doubts because the purpose of the establishment of the committee is not very clear. For example, there are currently a group of Europeans and Americans and a group of Japanese, totaling about 40 people, operating pilotage business in the Yangtze River area. However, it is not only not permitted for foreigners to operate business in the interior according to the commercial treaty, but also for them to privately form an association to perform pilotage business, which is not allowed by international law. We do not know when the above-mentioned illegal foreign business will be revoked. Also, the pilotage fees set by the foreigners themselves and the unilateral fee rates set by the Pilotage Management Committee are in opposition to each other. Is this policy intended to reject foreigners and benefit ourselves and use it to compete, or is it to tie our own hands and feet and be content with a lowly position? The principle of legislation must be based on something, and the spirit of travel should be popular and take into account all aspects. The above two points are beyond the understanding of shipping companies and are impossible to explain. The association should write to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and forward it to the committee, asking for a reply. We hereby submit this letter for your consideration and hope that you will forward it to the Pilotage Management Committee and ask them to clarify the above two points, so as to avoid doubts and meet the expectations of the public, etc., arriving at the association. Based on this, we are sending this letter to you, hoping that your esteemed committee will investigate and quickly explain the above two points to the association so that we can inform them. We deeply hope for your assistance."</p>
<h3>The New Ford Aircraft of China Aviation Corporation Arrived Yesterday</h3>
<p>Customs Clearance Yesterday, Unloading Starts Today</p>
<p>Assembly and Test Flight in Two Weeks</p>
<p>China Aviation Corporation, in order to prepare for the Shanghai-Yunnan air route, believes that the route has many mountains along the way and is difficult to navigate, requiring durable aircraft. Therefore, it ordered a large Ford aircraft from the United States a few months ago for application. According to reliable information from China Aviation Corporation yesterday morning, the Musk ship carrying the aircraft to China entered the port at 7:00 yesterday morning and arrived at the Osaka Wharf in Hongkou at 8:00 AM. The aircraft was transported by the American Most Company. The company has notified China Aviation Corporation that it has cleared customs yesterday and will start unloading today. The aircraft will be transported to the Longhua Airport for assembly. It can be assembled in about ten days. At that time, a short-distance test flight will be conducted in Shanghai first. If the results are good, it will depart from Shanghai and fly along the Yangtze River route to Chongqing, and then to Chengdu. The second test flight will be in Yunnan. Therefore, it is expected that the Shanghai-Yunnan air route can be officially opened next month.</p>
<h3>Chu Minyi and Others Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, Chen Ce, a member of the Central Committee, and Liu Weichi of the Ministry of Interior, left Beijing together by night train at 11:00 PM the night before last and arrived at the North Station at 7:20 yesterday morning. They immediately returned to their private residences to rest.</p>
<h3>Whereabouts of Notable People</h3>
<p>Zhu Peide and Chu Minyi took the night express train to Beijing yesterday.</p>
<p>Sun Ke, Ma Chaojun, Zeng Zhongming, and Ma Yinchu took the night express train out of Beijing yesterday and arrived in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>The China Alcohol Factory Did Not Open Yesterday</h3>
<p>Postponed to the 15th</p>
<p>Increased Quantity of Goods Shipped</p>
<p>Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo, considering that the quality of domestically produced alcohol could not meet the needs of the whole country, specially consulted with Huang Jiangquan, a giant of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, to build a large-scale China Alcohol Factory. It has now been completed and is already shipping goods unofficially. It was previously reported that the factory was scheduled to hold a formal ceremony at 12:00 noon on the first day of this month at the factory in Pudong, etc. A reporter from the East China News Agency recently interviewed Huang Jiangquan at Jianyuan Company, 115 Hamilton Building. He said that the opening ceremony reported in the newspaper was a misrepresentation, because preparations have not yet been completed. It will probably be held around the 15th. He also said that the test shipments were very successful. Initially, it was 4,000 gallons, but now it has increased to 6,000 gallons per day. If it is further researched and improved, it can be increased further. There are rumors that after the factory officially opens, the goods it produces will monopolize the market, causing smaller factories to be unable to survive. This statement is unnecessarily alarming, because the amount of alcohol needed in the market is very large. Adding one more factory will not result in oversupply and affect the existence of small factories. However, he is confident that in the future, the alcohol needed by the Chinese people will no longer need to be imported from foreign countries.</p>
<h3>YMCA Lecture on the Prospects of Greater Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai YMCA in Eight Immortals Bridge held the "Shanghai" series of lectures, the audience has been very enthusiastic every time. At 7:30 tonight, it will be the fourteenth lecture (the last lecture in the series), titled "The Prospects of Greater Shanghai." Mr. Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Government, has been specially invited to speak. People from all walks of life are welcome to listen. It is also reported that after the "Shanghai" series of lectures is completed, the association will hold a "Current International Situation" series of lectures more than ten times, and will invite first-class scholars who have a thorough understanding of international issues to be the speakers.</p>
<h3>The Celebration of the Memorial Day in Caohejing is Grand</h3>
<p>Since the Battle of Qi and Lu in the Year of Jiazi, Caohejing Town in western Shanghai was the first to bear the brunt. Fortunately, the head of the defense regiment, Yang Xinzheng, took on the arduous task amidst gunfire and bullets, providing firewood, rice, and accommodating soldiers, so that the entire town was spared from ruin. Out of the people's love and support, a lantern parade is held every year in the spring for three days to celebrate. This year is the eleventh anniversary, and the completion ceremony of Jinrong Pavilion will be held. Those who go to visit from all parties will inevitably be extremely crowded. Therefore, the city government was specially requested to dispatch regiment police to the scene to maintain order in advance. After receiving the report from Mayor Wu, he specially ordered the Security Department, Public Security Bureau, and Defense Committee to provide proper protection. Seven archways have been erected in the entire town, and the electric lights are brilliant in the evening, shining like daylight. All shops have hung lanterns and decorations in front of their doors. Yesterday was the third day. In the evening, the lantern parade was assembled on Caohejing Road. Participants included the Huangjia Garden Fire Brigade, military band, student teams from various schools, Xiqin Institute, Guanshengyuan, Xinzheng Society, Defense Regiment, Public Security Bureau, dragon lanterns, pavilion lanterns, warships, lion dances, and various lanterns from the people, with a total of more than one hundred items. The entire team was about two li long, led by the chief commanders Yuan Desheng and Ding Qingzhong, parading around the street, passing through Huangjia Garden all the way to Yangjiaqiao, and returning to the original place to disperse. Qi Xueqi, the head of the Security Department's regiment, temporarily dispatched forty security team members to participate, which was an unprecedented grand occasion.</p>
<h3>The Employment Industry Organizes a Trade Association</h3>
<p>This port is a major trading port in our country, with a population of more than three million, resulting in endless theft and abduction incidents. Also, servants often collude with bandits to plot wrongdoing. Reports and discussions are often heard. The reason is that the employment agencies have always lacked a sound organization. They cannot conduct proper screening and guarantee of the servants who request introduction. Moreover, most of the employment is done privately without the introduction of agencies, and there is no guarantee, which is even more harmful. Also, among the industry, there are those who set up empty shops, specializing in drawing commissions for gambling and selling people as their main business. The dark secrets are too numerous to mention. Now, Sun Zhaobei and others are actively and meticulously preparing to organize a trade association. They have now been approved for registration by the Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. On the 26th of last month, the association certificate and seal were issued. In addition to reporting to the various management agencies, they have directly written to the various trade associations to activate the seal and start working. They have also notified all the colleagues to register and join the association within seven days. The association has already discussed and agreed on the employment regulations regarding the protection of the employing family and the industry's rules and regulations. All the methods are extremely proper and have now been submitted to the competent authorities for promulgation and implementation.</p>
<h3>Tianzhang Paper Mill Resumes Work</h3>
<p>The case of the Tianzhang Paper Mill in Lujiazui, Pudong, which caused a strike by all the workers in the factory due to the dismissal of eleven workers including Jin Changfa, has not been resolved for many days. After the labor union submitted a request to the Party and government agencies for mediation, the Social Affairs Bureau now approved the labor side to resume work first, and then mediate impartially. The labor union then held a general meeting of all workers at 2:00 PM yesterday at the auditorium of the Fifth District Cigarette Industry Labor Union. Chairman Wu Gensheng reported the purpose of the meeting. Dai Youheng, a representative of the Municipal Party Department, repeatedly persuaded them. After a collective discussion, it was decided to abide by the instructions of the Social Affairs Bureau and the advice of the Municipal Party Department and decide to resume work collectively next Monday (the 4th). They also insisted on resolving the three conditions: (1) Wages will be paid as usual during the strike period. (2) The eleven dismissed workers will be reinstated. (3) Wages should be paid on time in the future.</p>
<h3>Wang Liutang, a Key Criminal in the Assassination of Chen Zhikui, is Transferred</h3>
<p>Chen Zhikui, a Yongbo resident and owner of the Qiantai Candle Shop at 52 Dongxinqiao Street, French Concession, returned to his store at 9:00 PM on April 14, 1933. He took a detour through the small alley next door to the north and returned to his home upstairs in the store. Suddenly, he was shot in the throat and killed by thugs in the alley. At the same time, Chen Qiancheng, the store manager and also a Yongbo resident, heard the sound and rushed out to rescue him. He was also shot and injured. Afterwards, the French police arrested two criminals, Zhu Quanxing and Chen Jinlan. They confessed that they had borrowed two pistols from Wang Liutang, who lived in the pavilion room upstairs in Qianfengtai, for the purpose of fighting and going downstairs. They walked to the alley and encountered Chen, and the gun accidentally went off, causing the disaster. Zhu and Chen were sent to the Second Special Court. After three trials, the two criminals were sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment each. Zhu has been sent to prison to serve his sentence. Chen escaped from prison in the detention center on the morning of December 27th of last year before he was about to be executed. This has been reported in the previous newspaper. However, Wang Liutang, who supplied the pistol, has not been arrested by the French police until now. Recently, Wang was found to be privately transporting firearms. The public police arrested Wang (also known as Wang Liutao and Genfu, 37 years old, local resident) and his accomplices Zhou Qiusheng (24 years old, local resident, residing at 1290 Xietu Road), Chen Caibao (26 years old, local resident, residing at 26 Sanjiuli, Sanmuqiao, Longhua Road), Qian Hongfa (36 years old, local resident), and a woman, Lu Xiaomei (26 years old, local resident), in Room 315 of the Dahua Hotel at the intersection of Xizang Road and Fuzhou Road on the 12th of last month. Three pistols were confiscated and they were sent to the First Special Court for prosecution and interrogation. Wang was sentenced to four years of imprisonment, and the remaining criminals were punished separately. Jin Jiulin, the inspector of the French police, reported to the detective, requesting the Second Special Court to prepare a document and send detectives Cai Jinzhang and Bao Tan Quan Qihong to the First Special Court the day before yesterday to escort Wang and the other five criminals back to the court. Yesterday, Yao Zhaodi, the lawyer of the criminal court's detective office of the Second Special Court, said that the defendant Wang Liutang was involved in the case of Zhu Quanxing and others shooting and killing Chen Zhikui on the evening of April 14, 1933. The First Special Court was asked to transfer the defendants to the court and requested a postponement. After the detective office has conducted a detailed investigation, he will file a lawsuit for interrogation. After Judge Li Changnian verified the report and briefly interrogated Wang and others, he approved the postponement to March 11 for further investigation and interrogation. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Human Traffickers Await Sentencing</h3>
<p>Wang Runhe and Zhang Faxiang, Chinese detectives of the Hongkou Police Department, cracked a human trafficking organization at 105 North Jiangxi Road at 7:00 PM on the 20th of last month. Four people, including Jiang Yongqing, Qiao Wengui, Cantonese woman Ma Amei, and Wang Chenshi, were arrested, and a set of smoking paraphernalia was confiscated. They, along with Wang Caigen, a Wuxi woman who reported the case, were sent to the Second Special District Court. Wang was deceived from her hometown to Shanghai by Jiang Yonggui four years ago and forced into prostitution in a brothel set up by Ma Amei. After the term expired, she returned to her hometown. She is now staying at Sister Gao Sanmei's place at 9 Jing'an Temple Road. It was instructed that the defendants be returned to custody separately and the matter be postponed to allow time to investigate that Jiang and Qiao had abducted a six-year-old girl named Jin Di (Wuxi native), a fourteen-year-old girl named Min Fenghao, and an eleven-year-old girl named Zhang Fuying (both natives of Xian Liyang) from Liyang and Wuxi last month. Jin Di was entrusted by Jiang Yongqing to a Cantonese woman A Sao who lived upstairs at 105 to be introduced by a fellow countrywoman Wang Zhangshi at 9 Penglai Road. She was sold to Li Chenshi, a Cantonese woman at 582 Wuchang Road, as an adopted daughter for a price of 35 yuan, and a contract was established. Min and Zhang were entrusted by the two defendants, Jiang and Qiao, to A Sao to be introduced and sold to a certain place as adopted daughters for a total of 190 yuan. After the incident, the sellers were afraid and sent the two girls back to the front of 105 North Jiangxi Road, where they were found by police detectives. After questioning, they learned that the girls had been abducted from their original hometown. One girl Min, lived in Zhou Village, Shangpeibu, outside the West Gate of Liyang. Detectives were sent to investigate the residence and discovered that Min Fenghao had been betrothed to Zhu Songlin's son as a child bride. Zhang's father's name was Dagao. Because his family was poor, Jiang Yongqing brought her to Shanghai and sold her to others as a daughter. This was the truth. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Zehan opened the Third Criminal Court to conduct a trial. Li Zhiyou, a lawyer from the Public Concession, detailed the situation and stated that Zhang Dagao had not arrived due to lack of travel expenses, but had written a letter entrusting Zhu Songlin to come to Shanghai. He wanted to take the two girls back to court. He presented the letter for review, and said that the defendant Wang Chenshi was found to be irrelevant and requested that she be released first. The court approved it. When questioning the defendant Ma Amei, she said that the smoking paraphernalia found was not for her to eat, and the rest was Jiang and Qiao's business. She asked for consideration. Jiang Yongqing confessed that the girl Zhang Fuying was entrusted by her father to Mei Guisheng and Zhang Yongfu to introduce her, and she was taken to Wuxi, transferred to a train to Shanghai, and entrusted to Qiao Wengui and others to sell her for fifty yuan. The girl's father took twenty-eight yuan, and he and Qiao only got ten yuan. Min was handed over to him by Guisheng at Wuxi Station to be brought to Shanghai, and she was also sold for 140 yuan by Qiao's people. Jin Di's sale was decided by her mother. The rest of his confession was evasive. Qiao Wengui confessed that both girls were handled by A Sao upstairs at 105, and he got a total of seven yuan afterwards. Finally, Li Chenshi, Wang Zhangshi, and Zhu Songlin and others testified. The girl Jin Di said that Li Chenshi treated her very well. Min pointed out that Zhu Songlin was indeed her father-in-law. Zhang said that she was brought to Shanghai by Jiang Yongqing on her father's instructions. Wang Caigen said that Jiang Yongqing had deceived her into Shanghai again to sell her, so she reported to the police. Judge Wu instructed that the defendants should still be returned to custody separately and sentenced at a later date. Min was taken back by Zhu Songlin, Jin Di was temporarily adopted by Li Chenshi, and Zhang was sent to the Women and Children Relief Society to await her father's arrival in Shanghai to claim her.</p>
<h3>Jingwei Elder Advocates for Regular Donations to the Red Cross</h3>
<p>Jingwei Elder, an honorary member of the Chinese Red Cross Society, has lived in Huang County, Shandong all his life and is a very persistent philanthropist. Considering that the society's funds were insufficient, which hindered the progress of its work, he has donated one yuan per month for the past twenty years, reaching 242 times. Now, in order to popularize the common donation of the Chinese people, he has published an advertisement in various newspapers to advise the Chinese people, expressing his views. He stated that the Chinese Red Cross Society has more than 30 years of history and achievements as an international charitable organization, and its reputation is well-known. Those who have benefited directly or indirectly are countless. From now on, everyone should work hard to assist the society in order to fulfill their natural duty. Whether they join the society or not, they only need to donate one yuan per month, and the society's affairs can be permanently maintained, bringing glory to the world and seeking happiness for compatriots.

<h3>Shanghai National Products Company Sponsors National Goods Factories</h3>
<p>Voluntary Consignment Sales of Inventory Without Commission</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Company, located across from the Hong Miao Temple on Nanjing Road, recognizing that the Northeast China national goods market has been seized and that the purchasing power of the North China market has also been affected by the dumping of Japanese goods, leading to its decline, has noted that the sales of national goods factories have been severely impacted. The recent economic panic in the city is largely due to this. Based on its commitment to promoting national goods and supporting domestic industries, the company has sent letters to various national goods factories, offering to voluntarily consign their inventory in the Discounted Inventory Department on the second floor without charging commission. Other exquisite products can also be promoted through mutually beneficial agreements. Furthermore, with the special approval of the Ningbo Industrial Bank, anyone who deposits national goods with the company and holds a deposit slip can negotiate a national goods revolving mortgage, providing financial assistance to the factories. Spring discounted goods in various departments are selling exceptionally well, with the one-corner and two-corner goods in the Discounted Inventory Department being particularly popular. Yesterday, due to the scheduled sale of "Gu Ben" soap at a special sacrificial price of one yuan thirty cents, buyers rushed to purchase, causing a surge like a tidal wave, which resulted in the smashing of a large glass in the cosmetics counter.</p>

<h3>The Decision on the Location of the 12th World Games Postponed to Next Year</h3>
<p>A special telegram from Oslo, Japan United Press, dated the 1st: The issue of deciding the venue for the 12th Olympic Games was discussed by the committee on the 1st, and it was decided to postpone the decision to the time of the Berlin Games, when the committee will make a decision.</p>
<h3>Italian Representative Denies Changing Stance on the 1940 Olympic Games</h3>
<p>Japanese Representatives Actively Lobby, Finland Also Insists on Not Giving Up</p>
<p>A Havas dispatch from Nauweijing City, dated the 28th: Sugimura, the Japanese representative attending the International Olympic Committee meeting, recently told the press that the Italian representative received instructions from the government to support Japan's proposal to hold the 12th Olympic Games in Japan in 1940. Japanese representatives are still continuing to lobby in various aspects, and Japan's request has a good chance of being realized. Finland is still insisting on hosting the next games. If it is finally decided to hold the games in Finland, Japanese athletes will definitely go to Finland to participate. If it is decided to hold the games in Japan, it will be even more convenient for Japanese athletes. Count Panagosa of Italy denied receiving a telegram from the government changing his stance to support Japan, saying, "Italy supports Japan's candidacy, but will never withdraw Italy's candidacy. Moreover, most of the representatives of various countries have already received instructions from their respective countries, and the Italian delegation has no reason to change its attitude." It is generally speculated that Japan's chances are now greater than before, but it is still difficult to be certain. Everything will be clear after the vote tomorrow.</p>
<p>Today, the International Committee reviewed the report of the International Amateur Athletic Federation Committee and approved the International Basketball Federation to participate in the next Games. In addition, it was heard that the issue of women's participation in the competition was discussed, but no resolution was passed. Also, Count Panagosa of Italy suggested dividing the events of the 1940 Olympic Games into two categories: events belonging to the summer should be held in Japan, and events belonging to the winter should be held in Italy. Although the representatives of the participating countries refused to express their opinions on this matter, it was heard that this suggestion has been rejected by the committee and it has been decided that all events should be held simultaneously in the same place.</p>

However, since the Baojia system is still in its infancy, the proposed compulsion of the people to enroll should be temporarily implemented by the county government in the most well-organized areas, based on household registration, to thoroughly investigate the exact number of illiterate people, and to carefully consider the county's talents and economy to properly formulate implementation methods and conduct pilot programs first. After achieving results, it will be promoted to the entire county.

They acknowledge that during the first and second Five-Year Plans, the number of school children has increased from 11.3 million to 24 million, and the number of schools has increased from 118,000 to 167,000. At the same time, school construction costs have reached 1.1 billion rubles. However, the increase in the number of schools is far less than the increase in the number of students, leading to mathematics classes being divided into two or even three shifts (shift system). As a result, school children cannot have public holidays. The People's Committee and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party resolved that starting in the fall of 1936, no urban school should have a third shift. To complete this resolution, 374 schools capable of accommodating 240,000 students should be opened this year at a cost of 224,978,000 rubles. By 1937, the second shift in major cities will be eliminated. By 1938, the second shift will be eliminated throughout the Soviet Union. At the same time, it was resolved that the Soviet Republics, provinces, states, districts, etc. must establish school building construction departments and be responsible for the National Planning Committee drafting a school building construction plan from 1936 to 1940 to completely eliminate the second shift. Once this plan is drafted, it will be submitted to the People's Committee for approval. The Education People's Committee has been approved to add 45 million rubles for the construction and renovation of normal schools and educational institutions this year.</p>

<p>Silver Prices Rise Frequently, Foreign Exchange Floods Endlessly</p>
<p>According to foreign news yesterday, London big bars, near and far, all rose .0625. The U.S. bar footing bought in after the close at the posted price plus .0625 to .125.

Compared to the previous close, the British pound was loose by .0625 and the U.S. dollar was tight by .1875, which was a small exchange squeeze. After the opening, it loosened. The Central Bank's posted price was announced, with the British pound flat and the U.S. dollar shrinking by 1.875. The customs gold unit rose by one li, with no impact. The Chinese merchant psychology was still weak, and banks lacked buying appetite. After the opening, it hardened. Banks took advantage of the low price to buy, and although there was still struggle, sentiment was weak again due to Sassoon &amp; Co. selling spot shillings. HSBC's posted price was announced, with the British pound rising .25 and the U.S. dollar rising 3.125. The process hardened. Although banks maintained taking advantage of the low price and were slightly stable, the process still turned loose and flooded. The situation at noon was confusing. The Indian silver report rose 11 annas in the afternoon, and the trend was still loose. Chinese merchants came to buy, and although they were able to maintain, the banks' selling appetite was still strong due to the Indian silver rising again for the second time. In addition, Reuters reported that Finance Minister Kong announced in Hankou that China was buying spot silver in London, and the process was still hard, because the trend of big bars was bound to increase. By the close, the near-term selling price was one shilling seven pence 4375 for the British pound and 39.1875 yuan for the U.S. dollar. Compared to the previous close, the British pound was loose by 3.125 and the U.S. dollar was hard by 375. Chinese merchants first sold and then bought, clearing about 100,000 pounds of shillings and more than 500,000 yuan of U.S. dollars. British-American Tobacco still had settlements.

<p>Call Loan Rate Returns to 1 Fen Higher</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the beginning of the month, the silver dollar market still lacked development possibilities. The market situation was mostly the same as before. The call loan rate, after falling once the day before yesterday, returned to 9 fen yesterday, 1 fen better than the day before yesterday. Dividing the head and adding water initially opened at 2 fen, and then immediately changed to a white division. Call loan ticket transactions amounted to more than 2.5 million in the early market, more than 500,000 in new transactions, more than 300,000 in the noon market, more than 800,000 in the Small General Association, more than 500,000 in silver mortgage loan transactions were redeemed, and more than 700,000 were newly made.

<p>Jiangnan and Guangdong Minor Currencies Show Greatly Different Rise and Fall</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Jiangnan minor currency was 828.5 yuan in both the morning and noon markets, up 3 yuan from the day before yesterday. Only 6,000 jiao of transactions were made in the morning market, with no news in the noon market. The Guangdong minor currency fell 1 yuan in the morning market to 733.8 yuan, and continued to fall 8 jiao in the noon market to 733 yuan. Therefore, the result was a drop of 1.8 yuan from the day before yesterday. 210,000 jiao of transactions were made in the morning market and 35,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins were still 331,000 wen, the same as the day before yesterday, with a transaction amount of 46,340 strings of wen, equivalent to 14,000 yuan in silver.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Bond Market in a Wait-and-See Mode</p>
<p>Rises and Falls Are Minimal</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange market was extremely stable and remained in a revolving path. Transactions were also greatly reduced. For example, the forward contracts of the three types of Bian Yi, 19 Guan, and 19 Shan did not open throughout the day. Large players did not buy or sell, and sporadic and swap transactions on the market were more lively. Both bulls and bears had ample time and were waiting and watching. Market prices were driven and entered a revolving state. The recent important financial meeting held in Hankou will have a lot to do with the public debt market. In the current environment, without new news, the future is not easy to cause fluctuations. The progress yesterday showed that each trade was high and low, with mutual differences. In the first trade in the morning, rises were more than falls, and in the second trade, falls were more than rises, all revolving between one and two jiao. Except for swap transactions, there were very few new buys that were completed. The afternoon trades were slightly weaker, but still uneven, and were mostly falls more than rises, with the number becoming smaller and smaller. The market was sluggish, with little honor or disgrace. As a result of market prices, the 20-volume and unified salt tax both rose by one jiao and five fen this month, and most other types rose by only one jiao and five fen to two jiao. There were four types that had no rise or fall. 23 Guan also tended to be stable. The total number of transactions was only 6,043,000 yuan. The results of the rise and fall are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit 100 yuan).</p>
<p>New York Stock Market Falls More Than Rises</p>
<p>New Fung Foreign Firm reported that yesterday (28th), the New York stock market trend revolved, with differences and softness. The total number of transactions made in February was the smallest February since 1921. Yesterday, the U.S. dollar exchange rate against the British pound soared, but it was low against the currencies of gold standard countries. Sugar stocks also rose due to rising sugar prices. Railroad stocks opened strong, but later, according to the reports of 51 top railroads, the total income of these railroads increased by 3.2% in January, but due to rising material prices and increased wages and taxes, the net operating income was 2.9% lower than last January. Therefore, it fell back near the close. The bond market rose and fell, but railroad bonds were unique in their strength. Small exchange stocks rose slightly, and the total number of transactions throughout the day was 570,000 shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Yarn and Cotton Fall After Rising</p>
<p>The yarn market rebounded the previous day, but fell again yesterday, indicating the weakness of the market. The actual price of a certain yarn is low, and the silver capital is still tight. Therefore, although there is a multi-company organized by the industry this month, the environment is not very good, and the hope of a big rise is unlikely. However, buyers are using great efforts to operate, and the future is still in turmoil.</p>
<p>Forward Yarn Drops by as Much as 1.5 Yuan</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened, and the foreign cotton tended to go downstream, and all months were sluggish. The March period was still flat due to the pull of the bulls, but the distant months tended to fall when filmed, and more people sold. When the second and third auctions were filmed, it was heard that the gold market was sluggish, the exchange rate was lengthening, and people's morale was frustrated. According to the market, a certain merchant threw out again. As a result, all months fell from three, six, and eight corners to one yuan again. In the afternoon, the number of buyers in the market was not strong, and the cotton price fell sharply, making it difficult for the related yarn market to rise excessively. All months fell five, six, seven, and eight corners again. A total of 1,120 bags were sold, 1,200 bags of Hengde, 1,400 bags of Rui Da, 950 bags of Jun Chang, 500 bags of Tong Xing, 750 bags of Sheng Yuan, 900 bags of Da Fu, and 950 bags of Tong Ji. The buyers were Da Feng 850 bags, Sui Long 750 bags, Shen Ji 1,900 bags, Jian Kang 900 bags, Yuan Da 550 bags, Yi Da 500 bags, and Chang Feng 600 bags. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices during the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Actual Sales of 1,400 Bags Weak</p>
<p>The current yarn sales are still good. According to the statistics of all gangs buying throughout the day, 1,395 bags were bought. The market is flat and weak. The buying amount of each gang is as follows:</p>
<p>The cotton market is trending weak, and the downward trend is becoming more and more intense. The actual reason is that the overseas cotton market is falling, and the exchange rate is rising sharply, so the calculation price is becoming cheaper day by day, and the inventory of cotton in Shanghai is huge. According to people in the cotton industry, there are still many flowers from various producing areas that have not been shipped out of the country, so they are doing their best to watch the cotton market fatigue.</p>
<p>Distant Month Cotton Falls Close to the Six Yuan Mark</p>
<p>The spot cotton market opened, and all months showed a big drop, and the selling wind was fierce. The U.S. and Indian cotton markets turned down, the exchange rate stepped up, and the calculation price of foreign cotton was getting closer and closer. At the same time, the current cotton inventory is not easy to sell out in a short time, the silver capital is still tight, and the factories need to reduce their size. Therefore, the footing of the cotton market is relatively loose, and people's minds are lazy. All months fell from four and a half corners to six and a half corners. The market opened in the afternoon and was still unstable. It was heard that the gold market was trending down, and a certain speculative circle in the market closed out a large number of long positions. The market disk opened lower and lower, and the current market transactions were exhausted. Therefore, all months reappeared with new lows, and the distant months broke the six yuan mark. As a result, all months fell from five cents to three and a half corners again. A total of 15,400 dan of Run Kang, 9,400 dan of Chang He, 1,900 dan of Jun Chang, 1,500 dan of Yuan Da, 2,200 dan of Tong Ji, 1,700 dan of He Xing, 2,000 dan of Geng Feng, 2,400 dan of Chang Yu, 2,400 dan of Yuan Yi, 2,400 dan of Chang Feng, and 1,500 dan of Yi Kang were sold. The buyers were 2,600 dan of Ji Feng, 4,800 dan of Da Fu, 3,900 dan of Sui Long, 6,900 dan of Yuan Da, 2,100 dan of Jun Chang, 3,500 dan of Shen Ji, 1,600 dan of Yi Chang, 3,100 dan of Sheng Yuan, 1,800 dan of Yong Da, and 1,500 dan of Yuan Xing Chang. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices during the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Current Cotton Factories Need to Stop</p>
<p>Current cotton consumption is becoming more and more calm, because the exchange rate continues to rise, foreign cotton continues to fall, the yarn market is also withering, the factory needs are silent, and business is becoming more and more rare.</p>
<p>Slight Rise and Fall in the Grades of Yarn and Cotton in August</p>
<p>The Grade of 20-Count Fugui Yarn Drops by Another Yuan to a Reduction of Seven Yuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Yarn Exchange held a cotton appraisal meeting on the 25th of last month to supply the August 24th period for delivery. As a result, the appraisal grades rose and fell, and the first-class B grade was originally increased by four and a half yuan, but now it is changed to a positive four yuan. The C grade was originally increased by three and a half yuan, but now it is changed to a positive three yuan. The D grade was originally increased by two and a half yuan, but now it is changed to a positive two yuan. In the second class, the A grade was originally increased by one and a half yuan, but now it is changed to a positive one yuan. The remaining third and fourth classes have not changed. The revised procedures and grade prices are excerpted below.</p>
<p>First Class</p>
<p>New Price Old Price</p>
<p>A Grade Add 8 Yuan Add 8 Yuan</p>
<p>B Grade Add 4 Yuan Add 4.5 Yuan</p>
<p>C Grade Add 3 Yuan Add 3.5 Yuan</p>
<p>D Grade Add 2 Yuan Add 2.5 Yuan</p>
<p>Second Class</p>
<p>A Grade Add 1 Yuan Add 1.5 Yuan</p>
<p>Also, the Cotton Yarn Examination Committee convened an appraisal meeting on the 26th of last month to supply the August 24th period as a delivery substitute. As a result, the 20-count Fugui yarn of Hengfeng Factory was reduced by 6 yuan according to the grade in July, but now it is changed to a reduction of 7 yuan. Also, the 16-count Fugui yarn of Hengfeng Factory was reduced by 19 yuan according to the grade in July, but now it is changed to a reduction of 20 yuan, a further drop of one yuan. The remaining 20-count, 16-count, and 10-count yarns have no changes and are the same as in July. Also, the brand name of Puyi Factory and the brand name of the new Yu Factory have not been changed and are still named Earth Brand.</p>
<p>The Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange Market announced that from March 1, a special certificate of 2 yuan will be added for each new trade made for the March period spot flower, and one party will be charged for both deposits.</p>
<p>U.S. Brokers Sell Forward Contracts Before New Cotton Policy is Finalized</p>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton opened, retailers closed out, and all months fell one to four pounds. Then, because the demand from the industry was still strong, it turned slightly stable. However, brokers sold forward contracts because the government had not finalized the new cotton policy, and at the same time, many March periods had to be settled continuously, so market prices often revolved at a low peak. The close was flat, with spot falling ten pounds and futures falling three to eight pounds. The British cotton market was firm, with spot rising four points and futures rising one to four points. Indian cotton was initially fatigued due to bulls closing out, but then it was strong due to Japanese merchants buying in. In the end, it was fatigued again due to a lack of buyers. Pingguoer fell three rupees, Aomu La fell 1.5 rupees, and Bailuo Xi fell 1.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (28th telegram).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for Bailuo Xi flower on the 1st was 244.5 rupees, down 125 rupees from the previous day's close.</p>
<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Flour and Wheat Plunge Wildly in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Gold Market Declines Steadily… Factories Continue Selling</p>
<p>After the opening of the flour and wheat market this morning, foreign wheat from Chicago fell by eight to sixteen points, and Canadian wheat fell by twelve to twenty points. At the opening price, various factories, given the tight current sales situation, increased spot prices. Therefore, at the opening, due to this reason, confidence was firm. Near-term months were higher than the previous day's closing price by one to two points. For example, March and April were as high as 2.4025 yuan. Unexpectedly, the gold market experienced another drastic change, and the market fell sharply. This international economic squeeze seemed to greatly benefit our country's imports. Therefore, after the second session, selling increased gradually, and market sentiment gradually declined. By the afternoon opening, due to the actual trend favoring short positions, factories continued to sell, and long positions painfully sold in reverse. The market fell sharply, with little hope of recovery. As a result, this month fell by 3.75 points, April and May fell by 4.25 points, (according to the morning opening price, a huge drop of 67 points,) June fell by 4.5 points, July fell by 4 points, August opened at 0.38 yuan, and closed at 0.3075 yuan, a total drop of 7.25 points.</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market, after the morning opening, showed an initial rise followed by a fall in various months. Foreign wheat was quoted as Chicago down eight to sixteen points, and Canadian wheat down twelve to twenty points. At the opening price, the small decline in foreign wheat, combined with the flour market's rebound at the end of the previous month, boosted confidence. March and April were up by 24 points. However, due to the sluggish flour market and the decline in the gold market, market sentiment weakened. By the afternoon opening, the market also fell sharply. One reason was the wild decline in the flour market, and the other was the combined price of wheat, quoted at 4.28 yuan. Some even reported that factories were continuing to order, causing great anxiety and continuous selling. Given the continued international exchange rate squeeze, the outlook is not optimistic. As a result, March plummeted by 14 points, April fell by 13 points, July fell by 8 points, and August standard opened at 0.45 yuan, and also fell by 10 points. The spot wheat market saw little inventory, and factory demand was high, so the market was stable. Haizhou wheat opened at 3.84 yuan, Mingguang Linhuai Pass wheat at 3.83 yuan, and Yingzhou Kunshan wheat at 3.84 yuan. Fuxin handled 2,000 bags.</p>
<p>No Significant Gains or Losses in the Hexia Rice Market</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply from various gangs suddenly became scarce, with only ten or more dealers (totaling nearly 2,000 shi). However, on the sales side, both retail and wholesale demand were slack. Wholesale dealers only handled about 200 bags. Therefore, the market was balanced between arrivals and sales. The prices of thick glutinous rice and thin indica rice were all stable, with no significant gains or losses. Dujian rice continued to soften, and dark changes in sales were also sluggish, following the downstream trend.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 11 or 12 boats arrived from various routes in Hexia. The market slightly improved as dealers cleverly took advantage of demand. The market price of white glutinous rice and thin indica rice was slightly higher, with retail sales of extra-grade rice sluggish. However, due to the small inventory, customers were quite firm, and prices did not rise or fall.</p>
<p>Imported Rice Weak in the Morning, Steady in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday's imported rice market was in poor condition in the morning due to continuous arrivals and cautious importers. The market continued to fall. Fortunately, in the afternoon, both Hankou and Jiujiang gangs took the opportunity to buy over 1,000 bags. Inland dealers followed suit, and local demand gradually picked up. The market turned from weak to stable. The total market opened with 2,800 bags of Saigon rice and 2,000 bags of Siamese small-grain glutinous rice and high-grade rice, and 350 bags of customer indica rice. Local dealers were the main buyers. However, the abundance of imported rice in stock made the market still feel weak.</p>
<p>Red Sorghum in a Supply-Demand Imbalance</p>
<p>Yesterday's red sorghum market remained tight due to high prices in Dalian and Kaiyuan and scarce supply. Existing red shells in Shanghai were already depleted, forcing the Changsha gang to settle for Guide and other grains. Yesterday, one truckload of Kaiyuan red shells was handled, with a price of 4.10 yuan, up another 0.10 yuan from the previous day. Another 800 bags of Guide grain were sold, priced from 3.55 yuan to 3.60 yuan. Three truckloads of Bengbu grain were priced at 3.40 yuan to 3.45 yuan. Prices all rose by 0.05 yuan to 0.10 yuan. Currently, the market is in a supply-demand imbalance, with prices likely to rise. Other routes, such as inland and Japanese gangs, seemed to be watching due to high prices. Soybean sales were sluggish, and market sentiment was weakening. The future trend is unlikely to improve for the time being.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods</h3>
<p>Orchid Seeds Rise in Price Again</p>
<p>Due to the dry weather last winter, the harvest of late-season orchid seeds was limited, resulting in extremely low inventory. Small amounts were shipped last month, and prices have already risen by nearly 10 yuan. Yesterday, only a dozen pieces arrived at the Daming import port. According to letters from merchants, costs have risen again, so prices were raised by 23 yuan, and the trend is firm.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Guangdong Coarse White Sugar Price Unchanged</p>
<p>1,735 Bags Traded</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend was flat. The Guangdong Sugar Industry Cooperative Company sold 1,735 bags of coarse white sugar for 16.60 yuan, with no change. Re-exported Dutch No. 24 coarse white sugar was still quoted at the original price of 4.85 yuan, with no transactions. This factory's fine white sugar was slightly lower than the previous day by 0.10 yuan. Zhenyu No. 1 was 16.30 yuan, No. 2 was 16.20 yuan, No. 3 was 16.05 yuan, and No. 4 was 15.90 yuan. The Chaozhou gang quoted over 1,000 bags of Huanggang Qing, priced at 10.30 yuan, 10.25 yuan, and 10.20 yuan, respectively. Longgang Qing was 9.35 yuan, slightly lower by 0.05 yuan. According to letters from Shantou, a total of over 600,000 bags of Chaoqing were produced last winter, and over 300,000 bags have already been sold. Therefore, the producers' subjective view is that prices will likely rise rather than fall compared to last year's market. Furthermore, the Shantou exchange rate fell by nearly 10 yuan yesterday, further increasing costs. The Guangdong gang quoted several hundred boxes of Beihai sliced Qing for 8.90 yuan, slightly lower by 0.10 yuan. The Jian gang quoted several dozen bags of Diaoqing for 9.50 yuan, down 0.30 yuan from the previous session.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Huzhou Silk Factory Plans to Handle Raw Silk</p>
<p>European and American silk markets have been rising recently. Due to unfavorable exchange rates and strong market sentiment in Shanghai, foreign silk sales have been sluggish. Yesterday, only Xinfu Yuhe and others purchased 21 bales of raw silk, and prices were slightly weaker. Several transactions are expected for user silk. A silk factory in Huzhou has entrusted an agent in Shanghai to handle raw materials for spring weaving, estimated to require over one hundred bales of raw silk. Negotiations are currently underway, and details will be published if a transaction occurs.</p>

<p>Random Notes</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Xu Haowu)</p>
<p>Near the Paris Cinema on Avenue Joffre, there is a bald pedestrian with a cane in his right arm and a letter in his left hand, asking everyone he meets for Yangshupu. He has been asking for days and walking for days—meanwhile, people pity him and fill his pocket with money every day—yet he is still on Avenue Joffre, not a few steps closer to Yangshupu.</p>
<p>Biologists predicted long ago that the upper class would ride in cars, the middle class in rickshaws, and the proletariat in trolleys and wheelbarrows. The feet have not been used for a long time, and the ability to walk long distances is far less than before. This is also the inevitable result of mechanical progress and the adaptation of things to the environment.</p>
<p>The eyesight of the eye depends on the pupil. Many people's pupils are completely occupied by the faces and forms of others, so the fault does not lie in "criticizing others is clear; criticizing oneself is dark," but in the complete absence of one's own likes and dislikes in the eyes.</p>
<p>Someone replied, "No self in the eyes" means forgetting oneself. In this way, the masses, although they have not received a meaningful baptism and are unaware of the essence of religion, are still faithful believers in religion. Respect, respect!</p>
<h3>Seven Pagodas of Suzhou</h3>
<p>— 19</p>
<p>Suzhou has the saying "Seven Pagodas and Eight Columns." The so-called "column" is made of brick, piled high in seven tiers, protruding from the house. From a distance, it looks like a pagoda but smaller. It is said that Liu Bowen built them for warding off evil. As for the seven pagodas, it is said that only four are visible in the city—North Temple Pagoda, Ruiguang Pagoda, Twin Pagodas, and White Pagoda is not included—combined with Tiger Hill Pagoda, Lingyan Pagoda, and Shangfang Pagoda outside the city, they become seven pagodas.</p>
<p>Another saying is that the seven pagodas of Suzhou refer specifically to those in the city, and the three pagodas outside the city are not included. The seven pagodas are: North Temple Pagoda, Ruiguang Pagoda, Twin Pagodas, White Pagoda, Stone Pagoda (now collapsed, the Stone Pagoda Head is its ruins), and one other pagoda, the name of which is forgotten.</p>
<p>Recently, I read a story about a pagoda in Lianxi Lane, Gong Lane, in Volume 3 of Chu Renhuo's "Additional Collection of Firm Earthenware":</p>
<p>"In Gong Lane, there is a pagoda more than ten feet high, with a circumference of about seven or eight feet. The top of the pagoda is cast in iron. However, when two or three people shake it below, it swings like a tree, and the bells ring by themselves, indicating that there must be a mechanism underneath, a legacy of the ingenious craftsmen. Also, there is a small pagoda in Lianxi Lane, directly opposite the entrance of Gong Lane. Old people say that in the past, in the mist, two people could pull red and green threads across the middle of the pagoda, horizontally, without any obstruction. Later, a stranger saw through it, and it could no longer be pulled."</p>
<p>Based on this, combined with the previous saying, Suzhou had eight pagodas in the city in the past. If the small pagoda in Lianxi Lane is regarded as an appendage and cannot be counted, it fits the saying of seven pagodas in the city. According to the current Suzhou, not only is the location of the small pagoda in Lianxi Lane unknown, but the ruins of the Gong Lane pagoda and the Stone Pagoda cannot be found either. The only pagodas standing tall in the city are the North Temple Pagoda, Ruiguang Pagoda, and the Twin Pagodas. As for the White Pagoda, it only has its appearance, without the spirit of reaching the clouds, and it does not seem worthy of being called a "pagoda."</p>
<h3>Standard College Student</h3>
<p>— Mumu</p>
<p>I met a standard college student beside a stall selling Weizhen Five-Spice Peanuts, a so-called "chance encounter." He is a student in the journalism department of XX University. His conversation often involves the words and deeds of famous figures in the contemporary news and cultural circles, and he can imitate the state of various professors, every move being lifelike. He also likes to make friends with writers and is diligent in corresponding. It is said that the monthly cost of stamps requires about three yuan, which is also considered a huge amount.</p>
<p>The "standard" points of a standard college student are five: First, he does not wear suits and leather shoes (except for military training uniforms). Second, he does not go to dance halls, dog races, ice skating, or play golf. Third, he does not associate with the kind of opposite sex who are red-hot queens or campus belles (on the contrary, Sister Feng who sells cantaloupe, the old woman who does laundry...are very recent). Fourth, he does not stick a crude "Parker" pen in his pocket, does not bring thick foreign books on the military vehicle, and does not wear dull platinum glasses. Fifth, everything about how many yuan a stone of white rice costs, how many coins an ounce of small yellow croaker costs...is difficult for other college students to know, but he can answer fluently.</p>
<p>On a certain day of a certain month, I accepted his invitation to drink at a nearby small hotel. A pot of Jingzhuang wine, a plate of sprouted beans, and a plate of dried cuts. We talked and laughed happily. Half drunk, he patted my shoulder and said, "Life, ha, life! We shouldn't take it too seriously, otherwise, we will lose the true fun of life first, but we can't take it too lightly either, otherwise, there will be no meaning in life. Unsuitable blind modernity is really bad, and hypocritical superficial morality also feels very meaningless."</p>
<p>Since I met the standard college student, I have been able to have my confusion dispelled unconsciously and have benefited a lot. Yesterday, I received a picture of him. A scholar in cloth clothes, unpretentious and unadorned. How many can you find in the ten-mile foreign market?</p>
<p>Teacher: Why are you absent from English class every time?</p>
<p>Student: This year is the year of students using domestic goods!</p>
<h3>Pharmaceutical Production from the Science of the Placenta</h3>
<p>— (Xinong)</p>
<p>(Continued from the Science Anecdotes of January 23)</p>
<p>To us "non-doctors," it is even more strange, mysterious, or even absurd! However, the fact is surprisingly unexpected. Recent experiments by Dr. Erhardt of Germany have indeed discovered that a very important drug, corpus luteum hormone, can be extracted from the placenta, and it exists in large quantities. Corpus luteum hormone is originally produced by the mature follicle in the ovary after the egg is released. Physiologically, it has the function of promoting the proliferation and loosening of the uterine mucosa to accommodate the fertilized egg. But now it has also become an important drug in gynecology. Women who are prone to miscarriage can avoid abortion after injecting this drug. It also has a life-saving hemostatic effect when a woman's organs are bleeding acutely. However, this drug is very difficult to extract, and the value of an effective preparation is very high, so it cannot be widely used clinically. According to Dr. Ai's report, 600 to 800 pig ovaries can only extract 30 to 35 effective units of internal secretion, while 10 units can be extracted from one (human) placenta. In this way, the placenta, which we consider filth, has also become an important raw material for pharmaceutical production in the new drug industry, although its efficacy is completely different from the experiences or imaginations of old Chinese medicine.</p>
<h3>Clever Couplets Collected</h3>
<p>— Qingqu</p>
<p>This time, Mr. Xiong Binglao and Ms. Mao Yanwen were married in Moore Hall. The congratulatory couplets that have been published are countless and are considered a good story. The other day, during a conversation, I mentioned this, and my old friend Qin Mumu said, "I also have a couplet, but unfortunately, I don't have the elegance to be a phoenix for even a day, so I can't win the appreciation of famous people!" Everyone heard this and asked him about it. He said, "The bright moon is hanging over the wonderful cloud brocade" "Good flowers are blooming again before the swallows return." Everyone didn't understand what he meant and remained silent for a long time. Mr. Qin said, "Gentlemen, stop, I specially mentioned his surname, why is it so difficult to solve?"</p>
<p>Later, Mr. Qin analyzed his meaning, and everyone admired him. Xiong's surname is "Xiong," and the starting stroke is "厶," which is the foot of the word "Yun," and the ancient writing of "Yun" is like "?", as if the cloud brocade is no different, adding the word "Moon" under "厶" is a round of bright moon hanging below, is it not very beautiful? This is the meaning of the first line. The left side of the word "Xiong" is "　", which is half of the word "Hua", like two flowers blooming up and down, blooming in spring. There are four dots below, written as "一", which is not fire, but the tail of the word "Yan". Examining the meaning of the word, we know that the swallow has not yet returned, so it is said that the swallows return before. I admired his picking the word "Xiong" and fighting in the middle, but in Ah Du, I picked it up to win a smile from the reader.</p>
<p>World Oddities</p>
<h3>An Examination of World Famous Wines (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Zhaoyu</p>
<p>For thousands of years, across tens of thousands of miles, the number of wine lovers is countless. Even with the power of the sage emperor Xia Yu, it was impossible to prevent the future danger of national destruction due to wine. The full prohibition of the United States could not prevent private drinking in cellars and secret rooms. The magic of wine can be imagined. Today, there are many countries in the world famous for their fine wines. Despite my humble knowledge, I will examine them. Those with Liu Ling's love for wine may also consider me a confidant?</p>
<p>World Famous Wines: Famous wines from various countries in the world: In India and Siam, there is Arrak (i.e. rice wine, with approximately 62% alcohol and 38% distilled water), Japan has Araki Sake and Tososake, England has Whiskey France, Italy has Wine, Spain has Sherry, Portugal has Port Wine, Holland has Gin, Germany has % Wine, Russia has Vodka, Austria has Klermar, Mexico has Barroque (made from agave juice), the West Indies has Rum, and the people of Mongolia, Central Asia, and the Balkans have Kumiss. In terms of the alcohol content of each type: Coconut wine has 4%, Gin has 54%, Whiskey and Rum are both around 50%, Japanese Sake has 17%, Wine has 13%, Barroque Wine has 6%, Beer has 4%, Kumiss (Russian) has 2%, Cow Milk Wine (Balkan) has 0.8%, and Vodka contains 95% Arkel, which is the fifth-highest alcohol content in the world. Since the revolution, the Soviet government, for the sake of national health, transferred it to state-owned enterprises, and the alcohol content was reduced to 40%, which is not much different from ordinary distilled spirits.</p>
<p>Chinese Famous Wines: Among the famous wines of China, Northern Sorghum and Southern Shaoxing are the most outstanding. In addition, there are Wujiapi Wine, Tiger Bone Papaya Wine, and Longan Wine, all of which are common medicinal wines for strengthening the body. Soy Sauce Wine (made from black beans) is a medicinal wine for adjusting blood in the urine and blood stasis. Mulberry Wine (made from mulberries) can sharpen hearing, improve eyesight, and treat edema. Mulberry Wine (made from mulberry branches and roots) can cure beriberi and stroke. Chrysanthemum Wine is used to cure headaches, and Purple Wine (made from chicken manure) is used to treat stroke. Thunder Wine (hot iron immersed in wine) is used to obtain fairy energy. There are many kinds of wines, too many to list. In short, for the purpose of treating diseases, no medicine cannot be made into wine, and no wine cannot be used in medicine. Therefore, cinnamon can be used to strengthen the stomach, platycodon can be used to relieve phlegm, saposhnikovia can be used to dispel wind evil, and motherwort can be used to activate blood circulation. Even ephedra wine is used for sweating, and rhubarb wine is used for reducing accumulation... All of these are based on medicine and supplemented by wine. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Records of the Floating Fragrance of Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Qingdeling, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Although the Empress Dowager had happily toured here for half a day when she came, wasn't she already ordering not to stop at any station on the way back? So we immediately passed through the station without even slowing down the speed of the train, rushing forward like an angry horse. However, the platforms on both sides were already crowded with kneeling officials, who all prostrated themselves as the train passed in front of them, almost bumping their heads on the ground to show their respect. However, what about our Empress Dowager? She certainly knew that there were so many people outside, kowtowing and paying their respects to her, but she was not happy to pay attention to them! She simply disdained to even look at them.</p>
<p>Just like this, the wheels of the car kept rushing on the road. Even when eating, everyone felt very hurried, as if we didn't have time to take care of anything else except wanting to go back with all our hearts. It's really ridiculous. In ordinary times, we only felt that the Forbidden City in Beijing was stereotyped, fierce, and hateful, and everyone wanted to get out of this circle and relax. But now, it seems that those desolate palaces and quiet halls are our place to live and settle down, and we can't do without them. We were afraid that after we had been out for more than ten days, there would be some great chaos here, making it impossible for us to live the same life as before. Therefore, everyone was eager to know what was going on.</p>
<p>I remember when we went to Fengtian, almost everyone in our group was energetic, enthusiastic, and full of the vigor that travelers usually have. But at this moment, there was nothing left! (257)</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Nine: Failing to Flatter and Begging for Help Results in Scolding; Unable to Return Home, the Guest's Exaggeration is Bewildering</p>
<p>As long as I have food to eat, anything is fine. I didn't expect to see that lady today, and without saying a word, she scolded my mother and me out. My business is not easy either! Zhang Jiefu said; That's what we think too. Look, this Master Jia is so rich, he just puts these things on the table casually. If your daughter lives with someone like this, what do you have to worry about for food and clothing? Mrs. Hu originally felt that this Master Jia had too much money, and now that Jiefu mentioned it, she was even more moved. She said; Yes! I heard that someone who owns a silver shop lives in Little Western Paradise, he's a living god of wealth! Is that this master? Zhang Jiefu said: He doesn't own a shop, he owns a bank. How could Mrs. Hu understand the word bank? She stared and asked: Didn't this master say that his family's silver dollars, even dozens of houses in this Little Western Paradise can't hold them all? If the family doesn't own a silver shop, where do these silver dollars come from? Zhang Jiefu said: What he owns is even bigger than a silver shop. Mrs. Hu said: Then that's a gold shop. Jia Duocai had to frown at Zhang Jiefu and said: This question doesn't need to be studied that much. Zhang Jiefu nodded and smiled: Sister-in-law, do you think this house is good? Mrs. Hu pressed her knees with both hands, stretched her body forward, and opened her mouth and stared, expressing a very sincere look. She replied: How can this house not be good? It's like a heavenly palace, no wonder it's called Little Western Paradise. Zhang Jiefu smiled: You said this is a heavenly palace. To be honest with you, Master Jia's outhouse is even more beautiful than this. Mrs. Hu said: Is that so? Then that's incredible? Yueying was originally looking down, only listening to their negotiations, and not expressing her opinion. But Zhang Jiefu's words surprised her so much that she couldn't help but look up. Zhang Jiefu was also looking at him, and he smiled: Miss, maybe you don't believe it? Yueying couldn't answer anything, and still looked down. (146)</p>

<h3>Notes on Repairing Neutrodyne Receivers (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Xiao Mingxiang</p>
<p>Squealing and Howling</p>
<p>Howling (like the sound of a regenerative receiver oscillating when it encounters a radio station) is often caused by the intermediate frequency stage not being properly adjusted to 175KC, or by the poor selectivity of the tuning circuit of the high-frequency amplification stage. The method to identify the cause of this problem is very simple. First, short-circuit the tuning capacitor of the oscillator stage, i.e., connect the moving plate and the fixed plate. Then, turn the volume control to the strongest point. In this situation, there should be silence in the radio, and no radio station should be able to be received. If any radio stations can still be heard at a few points on the dial when the oscillator stops working, it can be determined that the howling is due to the improper adjustment of the intermediate frequency stage. If there is no sound when the oscillator is stopped, but the howling still occurs when the short-circuit connection of the oscillator stage capacitor is removed, it is due to the insufficient selectivity of the high-frequency amplification stage. A simple repair method is to shorten the antenna extremely, reduce the number of turns in the primary of the antenna coil, or use a very small capacitor, about 500mmf, connected in the antenna lead. Also, many #24 vacuum tubes, although in perfect condition, often cannot work when used as a dynatron oscillator, can often eliminate howling, which is very effective.</p>
<p>Repeating Points</p>
<p>Occasionally, when listening to a radio station's music on a neutrodyne receiver, the radio station reappears when the dial is turned to a position approximately 350KC away. The first method to remedy this has been described in the previous section, which is to adjust the intermediate frequency to a very accurate 175KC. The second method is to improve the isolation of the radio, so that it cannot be picked up directly. For example, if the bottom edge of the chassis has no isolation plate, it must be installed. The top must also be covered with a grounded metal plate. As for the components inside the machine, such as coil capacitors and grid top cap connections, they must all be properly isolated to prevent this problem from occurring.</p>
<p>Dead Spot</p>
<p>Sometimes, a neutrodyne receiver is extremely sensitive in one high-frequency range, but when tuned to another range, it completely stops working and nothing can be heard. This problem is often caused by the voltage of the oscillator tube's various electrodes being mismatched, causing the oscillation to stop at the dead spot. Correcting the voltage of each electrode can revive this problem. Oscillators that use the Dynatron method should pay special attention to perfect operation, so it is best to replace them with a large number of the same type of vacuum tubes, one by one, to test them.</p>
<p>Intermittent Sound Quality</p>
<p>Occasionally, in a neutrodyne receiver, the sound quality is excellent when the volume control is adjusted to the highest point, but if the volume is slightly reduced, the sound becomes intermittent, chopped into pieces. When encountering this situation, the internal vacuum tubes should be carefully checked to see if a #24 vacuum tube has been mistakenly inserted into the socket that should be used for a 35 or 51 variable-mu vacuum tube. Correcting the position of each vacuum tube can correct this problem.</p>
<h3>Experiment Report on Assembling 1A6</h3>
<p>— Zhang Shouyu</p>
<p>Amateur radio enthusiasts welcome new types of vacuum tubes that save electricity and have multiple functions. Therefore, my brother bought a 1A6 several months ago. However, the result of assembling and testing it was either complete silence or wild screaming. At most, we could only hear faint broadcasts from large radio stations. Repeated disappointments made him suspect that he had bought a defective product, so he simply stopped assembling it. Last month, when my brother and I came to work in the same place, we dug out the 1A6 again. After six or seven improvements, we finally succeeded. New tubes are not easy to assemble. Thinking of the suffering of those who are in the same boat, I am reporting the experiment.</p>
<p>Currently, this machine receives as far as Hebei Broadcasting Station YGQT and Hong Kong Broadcasting Station ZBW. When receiving Shanghai broadcasts, all those above 50 watts are received. (The receiving location is in the countryside of Wujin, with the antenna oriented north-south, over fifty feet high, eighty feet long, and a poor ground connection.) The sound quality is extremely clear, and the volume is also loud. Adding a 30-type low-frequency amplifier stage makes the speaker sound excellent (the fading phenomenon is severe when receiving Beijing). It works like this every day.</p>
<p>The circuit is as follows:</p>
<p>List of components:</p>
<p>R.F.C., R.F.C.1 = 4M.H. honeycomb high-impedance coil.</p>
<p>R.F.C.2, R.F.C.3 = Ordinary high-impedance coil.</p>
<p>C.C1 = .0005M.F.D.　C2 = .0003M.F.D.</p>
<p>C3, C4 = .1M.F.D.　　C5 = .004M.F.D</p>
<p>L1, L3: Use a 1.25-inch plastic tube, wind 125 turns of 26-gauge wire. Insert a honeycomb R.F.C. into the tube at the end connected to the moving plate. Connect a stranded wire from the R.F.C. Wind three turns at the end of the coil connected to the grid, forming L, L2. This is the most popular high-frequency amplification coupling method in the United States.</p>
<p>This machine is a single-stage high-frequency amplifier and a single-stage detector. In radios, high-frequency amplifiers are the most difficult to assemble. Now, using the R.F.C. coupling method, beginners can also easily achieve good results. Furthermore, the sound is very balanced across all wavebands, and the antenna can fully exert its effectiveness, which is a great advantage in terms of performance. This is much better than using primary and secondary coil coupling.</p>
<p>When assembling the 1A6, pay close attention to the following points:</p>
<p>(1) The grid of the 1A6 should be connected to the C battery according to the specified characteristics. After repeated experiments, a 1.5-volt C battery is best when the B battery is 90 volts. This can make the high-frequency amplification ability extremely high. If connected to the negative terminal of the A battery without connecting the C battery, there will still be sound, but the high-frequency amplification will not be good.</p>
<p>(2) The various electrodes inside the 1A6 tube are very close together. If high-frequency and low-frequency circuits are not properly designed, they will inevitably affect each other, resulting in poor performance. C3, C4, C5, R.F.C.2, and R.E.C.3 in the diagram are used to solve high and low-frequency interference. The capacitance of C can be tested individually until the received sound is extremely clear.</p>
<p>(3) The B voltage of the 1A6 screen grid must not be too high, and it must not be higher than the detector B voltage. I previously found some circuit diagrams in publications that were truly laughable. The detector stage was connected to 45 volts, and the screen grid was connected to 67.5 volts. My brother failed dozens of times because he fell for these idealized articles written by people trying to scam money. I admire Mr. Ma Xixian in the Shenbao. His circuit diagram is correct, with the screen grid connected to 22.5 volts. I believe he is an experimenter. According to the operation of electricity, electrons are emitted toward the anode. Unless it is at saturation, the higher the anode voltage, the more electrons are absorbed. Therefore, if the screen grid is connected to 67.5 volts and the detector is connected to 45 volts, no matter how many turns the regeneration coil has, the detector stage will absolutely not oscillate. This point requires extreme attention, so do not be fooled again.</p>
<p>(4) The 1A6 is extremely sensitive to induction. Therefore, L1 and L3 should be placed far apart and at right angles to each other. It is best to use shielding covers for both the vacuum tube and the coil. Furthermore, the shielding cover for the coil should be large. If the coil diameter is one inch, the cover diameter should be three inches. Otherwise, if the cover is too tight, it will absorb the coil's electrical energy, and the received sound will be very low.</p>
<p>Finally, I will talk about the situation of receiving Beijing and Hebei Broadcasting Stations. Under our environment, it is originally very difficult to receive Beijing because we are very close to Wuxi. The Wuxi Xingye Broadcasting Station has a frequency of 1250K.C., while the Hebei Broadcasting Station has a frequency of 1220K.B. Usually, it is always blocked by the Xingye station, and the Xingye station's frequency modulation is extremely wide, which is extremely annoying. Now that we can receive Beijing every day, we must attribute it to the high-frequency amplification of the 1A6. The difference between Xingye and Hebei is only 30 kilocycles. Although there is a slight mix when broadcasting at the same time, it is not disturbed to the point of being unreceivable. As for the Beijing programs, the famous opera actors of various theaters broadcast Beijing opera every day from 10 PM to 12 AM, which is extremely welcomed by opera fans.</p>
<p>I hope comrades will experiment with this circuit and improve it through experimentation and also give a faithful report.</p>
<h3>Method for Replacing C Batteries</h3>
<p>— Chongling</p>
<p>In the amplification circuits of radio transmission and reception, in order to keep the grid constantly at a negative voltage to avoid power consumption in the grid circuit and to prevent amplification distortion of the vacuum tube, a dry battery is often inserted into the grid circuit to keep the grid voltage lower than the filament, thus maintaining a negative voltage. This type of battery is commonly referred to as a C battery, as shown in Figure 1 C.</p>
<p>In AC machines, for convenience, only one AC power source is used. If a dry battery is to be inserted separately into the grid circuit, it is inconvenient in terms of installation and application. Therefore, the method of replacing C batteries is very useful. The method involves inserting a resistor R in the plate circuit and connecting it in series with the negative terminal of the plate, and then connecting the grid to this junction point, as shown in Figure 2. Using the voltage drop across R caused by the plate current, the grid becomes lower than the filament, resulting in a negative voltage. The value of R must be determined by the plate current and the required grid negative voltage. Let the grid negative voltage be Ec (i.e., the voltage of the required C battery), and the plate DC current be Ip. Then,</p>
<p>Although the connection in Figure 2 can achieve a grid negative voltage, it inevitably reduces the amplification effect, which is a flaw, because the AC voltage drop generated by the plate current change through R is fed back to the grid circuit.</p>
<p>(1) Bypass Method: A larger capacitor C can be connected in parallel with R to form a bypass (as shown in Figure 3). The value of C is often above 10 picofarads because its impedance to AC is very small. The AC part of the plate circuit flows through this bypass, without affecting the grid voltage generated by the resistor R. This method can certainly prevent the reduction of amplification effect in resistance-coupled amplifiers, and sometimes even increase the amplification effect in transformer-coupled amplifiers.</p>
<p>(2) Feedback Prevention Method (1): A capacitor C1 is connected between the plate and the cathode (i.e., the filament) to prevent feedback, as shown in Figure 4, which can also avoid amplification loss. Because this connection can make the plate current flowing through R only DC. (3) Feedback Prevention Method (2): The third method is to connect a series circuit of capacitor C2 and resistor R2 in parallel with R, and the grid voltage is taken from between C2 and R2 (as shown in Figure 5). The values of R2 and C2 are similar to RC in Figure 3. After proper configuration, its effect can even be better than the first method.</p>

<h3>Handling a Broken Transformer Wire</h3>
<p>— Shen</p>
<p>If a transformer has been used for too long, or if the winding distance is uneven during winding, resulting in poor insulation, the coil may break. Normally, if a multimeter confirms that the coil is broken, all the coils are disassembled and rewound. However, disassembling and rewinding involves many procedures, and the result is that it is a very uneconomical thing to do for a very thin wire.</p>
<p>Because disassembling and rewinding is uneconomical, many people apply 220 volts of AC power to the two ends of the coil. After energizing, the broken part will automatically weld together. This is using an electric welding method. However, although the electric welding method can also be effective, if one is not careful, it is easy to cause accidental danger due to the excessively high voltage, which is also not appropriate.</p>
<p>Now, just use a 12-volt storage battery instead of 220 volts of AC power, use a spark coil, and then use an interrupter switch (i.e., a momentary switch), connect them in series to the storage battery, and then use a wire to connect to the broken coil. When the interrupter switch is opened and closed, intermittent current will occur continuously for about half a minute, which can automatically weld the broken coil together. This welding method is more effective than using 220 volts of AC power, and there is no danger at all. It is much more convenient than disassembling and rewinding.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when the break is not very deep, a storage battery with a voltage slightly lower than 12 volts can also achieve good results. However, sometimes, when the break is too deep, a storage battery with a voltage of up to 18 volts will definitely be effective.</p>
<p>If an 18-volt storage battery is used and still cannot weld according to the above method, there is no way to save it by using a higher voltage. The only option is to disassemble and rewind it.</p>

<h3>On the Choice of Subject Matter and the Responsibility of Criticism</h3>
<p>— Xin Ren</p>
<p>The subject matter of art is diverse because the reality that serves as the source of these subject matters is complex and varied, and its development is curvilinear. A talented creator inevitably embodies the reality of truth in a comprehensive form and with diverse subject matter.</p>
<p>However, in a certain era and society, due to the different stages of development of productive forces, certain social relations are formed. These relations are extremely complex and often cannot be "uniform." Therefore, when facing this dazzling reality, writers encounter the problem of "choice of subject matter."</p>
<p>The necessity of choosing a subject matter, no one will deny it now, right? Because in fact, no matter what kind of writer, even that kind of tedious empiricist author—they specialize in depicting "trivial matters around them"—has a "choice of subject matter." Japan's current popular novelist Kikuchi Kan, everyone knows his excessive production, "anything" is included in the novel. However, if we look closely, the subject matter of Kikuchi Kan's works actually has a certain scope and a certain selection. His recent work "Zhenyi's Questions and Answers" was made into a two-part film, which caused a sensation among a part of the petty bourgeoisie, precisely because he "selected" the backward and decadent part of the petty bourgeoisie's life in this "unstable era," and then used his consciousness that violates reality and formal skills to express it.</p>
<p>Every writer knows that the choice of subject matter is indeed necessary, but due to different social group consciousness and due to differences in talent, this choice appears complex and difficult. It is precisely for this reason that this issue requires our utmost attention.</p>
<p>Recently, I saw a small debate about this issue, which was caused by the criticism of the inaugural issue of the magazine "Eastward Flow." After seeing the discussion, the necessity of choosing a subject matter was acknowledged; because if writers and critics must ask: "Is this a subject matter?" it means that they must have a choice of subject matter. Therefore, the question here is how to choose.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, a certain era and society has certain social relations—typical circumstances. For example, England during the Renaissance, the culture of commercial capitalism, had the following four characteristics: first, individualism; second, nationalism; third, monarchism; fourth, imperialism. These characteristics are the typical circumstances of British society at that time. The great poet and playwright Shakespeare embodied these typical circumstances and social characteristics in his works.</p>
<p>But if Shakespeare had stopped here, he would not have become a great artist, right? He went through these typical circumstances and further expressed the typical characters formed based on the typical circumstances. As V.M. Friche analyzed, Shakespeare artistically expressed all the typical characters in his works. The love expressed in "Romeo and Juliet," the jealousy expressed in "Othello," the ambition expressed in "Macbeth," the indecisiveness expressed in "Hamlet"... all indicate the emphasis on individualism in the commercial capitalist era. The love of the motherland and the contempt for foreign people expressed in "King Henry IV" and "King Richard II" are reflections of the nationalist spirit of the time. In addition, the spirit of monarchical politics expressed in "Julius Caesar" and the spirit of exploring desolate islands expressed in "The Tempest" are all expressions of the social demands of monarchism and imperialism at that time. Shakespeare embodied these typical things in the development process of society, such as the typical miserly merchant Shylock, the typical declining nobleman Antonio, and the process of the struggle between these two parties, etc.</p>
<p>From Shakespeare's example, we get a glimpse of a great writer's "creative secret." What is this secret? It is that all great works of art express certain typical characters through the social circumstances of a certain era.</p>
<p>If this question can be well understood, then the so-called problem of choice of subject matter will be easily solved. All realist writers must "choose" subject matter in reality. This subject matter must be the most capable of expressing the typical circumstances and typical characters of this era. Here, a question may arise: On the one hand, we say that all subject matter must be typical circumstances and characters; on the other hand, we often talk about the diversity of subject matter (because the reality that provides subject matter is complex and varied, and it develops curvilinearly), isn't this a contradiction? Yes, it is not contradictory at all. Please look at the diversity of subject matter and the unity of those typical things in Shakespeare and Balzac, and you will understand. If current writers tend to formularism in pursuit of "typicality," it is caused by the conceptualization of the author's understanding of reality.</p>
<p>In the debate about the criticism of the inaugural issue of "Eastward Flow" mentioned above, the main issue was the novel "Good Tune Uncle," which used "child psychology" as its subject matter. The author, Fan Haijun, limited the subject matter to a one-sided description in that novel, so there was no "power" element in it, only the element of humanistic sadness existed. This subject matter was pointed out as not having much significance, that is, the author did not grasp the essential aspects of the era with the attitude he used to deal with the subject matter. However, some people think that interfering with the writer's choice of subject matter is not the responsibility of the critic, and believe that this kind of criticism is a phenomenon of "infant killing" in the literary world, and also believe that critics must treat all subject matter with the same perspective. If this opinion understands the necessity of the above-mentioned choice of subject matter, if it acknowledges that the responsibility of the critic lies in assisting the writer in delving into reality and expressing the truth of reality, it can be seen as wrong. Here, I can offer a well-known piece of news to those who are falsely alarmed by the illusion of "infant killing"—not only has the "infant" not been killed, but it is growing toward a healthy path.</p>
<h3>Water-Carrying Cart</h3>
<p>— Shen Shengshi</p>
<p>Silently, a child sits on the small building on the hillside, listening to the water-carrying cart creakingly pushed past on the distant field ridge, the wheels grinding out a mournful sound: after one cart is pushed past, the wheel sound of the second cart follows, floating over creakingly.</p>
<p>Looking at the water-carrying cart, I miss my hometown in the water country of Jiangnan.</p>
<p>In my hometown, Wuxian, Jiangnan, I have never had the opportunity to see a water-carrying cart; Jiangnan is a beautiful water country! I remember Tang Bohu's Miscellaneous Poems of Suzhou from the Ming Dynasty: "The city river is everywhere where you can shake the oars, people never stop in the streets and lanes all night long," "Go to the early market and get up early, tour boats go straight to the mountain side," in the spring, on the riverbank permeated with warm sunshine, under the green willow trees, you take your young younger brother and sister to the riverbank to see the clear green river water, the water is wrinkled with slight ripples, one or two occasional tender yellow willow leaves, shaken off by the breeze, float on the water surface, gently flow past, flow past; the boat passes, the river water embraces deep eddies of laughter, no wonder our poets want to sing "The people of Jiangnan are all like gods."</p>
<p>Spring is back again. In a distant foreign land, I miss Jiangnan, the water country of Lin Qinse. I love to see the spring water and the shadows of the boats. My hometown cannot hear the mournful sound of the water cart.</p>
<p>The place here is surrounded by mountains on three sides. The Huai River and the Wo River are the only waterways. There is no city river in the city. When you run to the street, it is full of uneven stone roads, and you can't find a bridge because there is no water, and this place lacks this kind of architecture.</p>
<p>The streets are also constantly pushed by water-carrying carts all day long; the water we drink is all spring water carried down from the mountains, and the mountain spring is the only water supply here.</p>
<p>Let me tell you again that those who push water carts are very laborious and pitiful. These coolies rely on pushing water carts for life.</p>
<p>The cart is a wooden-wheeled cart pushed by a single person, with two large buckets of water on the cart; a very thick cloth strap is fastened on the neck, and the two ends of the strap are tied to the car handle, and then the hand holds the two car handles and pushes forward hard: think about it! Just say how much force he has to withstand on his neck. This is a very hard work!</p>
<p>Those coolies who push water carts eat the worst kind of noodles every day and get a small reward. They have to continue doing this work forever in order to solve their daily eating problems.</p>
<h3>Along the Landun Bulaba Road</h3>
<p>— Fei Er</p>
<p>Starting from the pier opposite Banyan, the road is entirely built of mud. Because the repair of the national road has not yet reached this place (the Dutch government is the best at controlling its treasury. If a place has not yet developed to a certain extent, it will not easily coat a road with asphalt.), so the holes after the rain and the ruts of the wheels turned into hard scars under the sun: and the car swayed and bumped in it, making the guests enjoy a kind of pain.</p>
<p>Only when near the durian orchard of Wanle, there is an asphalt road. Travelers can breathe a sigh of relief after a long bumpy ride.</p>
<p>From time to time, traffic police checkpoints are encountered in the forest, and the car slowly drives up until it stops. After the police check the number of passengers and the speed of the car, the driver often speeds up again beyond the legal speed. Occasionally, when there are questions, the passengers in the car should be questioned one by one, delaying a little time, and then the red flag will be waved to indicate the car to move forward. —These actions are set up for evading passengers and illegal citizens.</p>
<p>Gradually approaching Landun Bulaba, the hilly area of central Sumatra appears on the journey. The car gradually rises and falls on the road.</p>
<p>On an iron bridge, both ends are a vast slope. The car climbs on the slope at one end, and when it reaches the top of the iron bridge, the car slowly slides down again.</p>
<p>Under the bridge, there is a gurgling dark red river flowing. The setting sun shines on the fields, and looking down from the iron bridge at the top, the treetops on all sides are shining by the sunlight, turning into a golden yellow, floating on a dark green surface.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a burst of car whistles awakened me. I looked ahead, and four or five Bengalis, with their majestic bodies, carrying hundreds of pounds of Indian cloth, riding bicycles, slid down from the bridge at the same time.</p>
<p>The technique of Bengalis carrying cloth and riding bicycles is very superb. You see, he can control the center of gravity of the car, with a weight of five or six hundred pounds including people and objects, climbing up and down without hindrance in the hills, and running in the forest road for many hours without showing any fatigue.</p>
<p>But unexpectedly, a scream suddenly came from the companions of the Bengalis in front, and a person and the car overturned into the ditch on the side of the road. So a group of Bengalis hurriedly stopped the car—the car had already slid far away—and slowly helped their companions up from the deep ditch. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Joy of Forgetting Sorrow</h3>
<p>— Zang Kejia</p>
<p>In the past year or two, there has been a phenomenon that, if you are a mindful person observing quietly, has an indescribable flavor. This is that some new things have become old, while some old things have indeed become new.</p>
<p>Since the adoption of the new calendar, purely old lunar calendars are rarely seen. However, a third type has been added to the calendars – the combined solar-lunar calendar. Chinese people have always liked "moderation," and this can be considered an expression of "holding to the middle ground." Frankly speaking, even if old lunar calendars disappear from the world, the seasons of the old lunar calendar cannot be obscured, because people in the countryside still consider the new calendar to be a foreign thing. Although the old lunar calendar has left their eyes, it has run into their hearts and onto their fingertips. Old habits and psychology are probably not easily overthrown. In the countryside, spring couplets still write "May the Emperor live ten thousand years." This is the ignorance of the common people and should not be overly criticized. Don't you see people still using prayer to seek heaven and gods, even while loudly denouncing superstition?</p>
<p>Not having holidays for the old lunar New Year represents "newness," but the old lunar New Year cannot be ignored. Thus, the "holiday" is still taken, but with a changed name. Officials and the people rejoice together for a few days, and everyone gets a taste of the reality of the old year. After the old year, the first great day is naturally the Lantern Festival. There is no need to first check the "full moon" character on the new calendar. Everyone has already prepared for it. It is said that in major cities, the ban on fireworks has been lifted to allow the people to enjoy themselves for a few nights, creating an atmosphere of prosperity and peace. In ancient times, night tours were not prohibited during the Lantern Festival, and "rejoicing with the people" is the same in ancient and modern times. Last year, I spent the Lantern Festival in Qingdao, and the noise of firecrackers kept me from sleeping well all night. Afraid of being squeezed into the sea by the crowd, I only poked my head out at the head of Zhongshan Road and was scared back by the mountain-like sea of people and voices. Unexpectedly, this year I would spend the Lantern Festival in this county town. I had heard that the people here loved excitement, and they had specially ordered fireworks from a big city, spending hundreds of dollars. I was born in a broken, small village and had never seen anything like it.</p>
<p>This time, I was determined to see it. On the afternoon of the thirteenth, people from the Jinde Society swarmed in like hundreds of rivers flowing into the sea. The flying dust made the daylight dim. People on foot, in cars, on horseback, old, young, rustic, fashionable – what a mixed and colorful group! The next day was even more lively. The reed sheds on the top of the streets seemed like a lowered blue sky, and the gauze lanterns at every door seemed like moons and stars. The lanterns, in different styles, depicted a series of stories drawn with different colored pens, romantic and fantastical. People were not allowed to stand still in the streets, and their bodies were squeezed floating in the air. The setting sun disappeared moment by moment, and people's excitement rose moment by moment. Children held lanterns, lotus lanterns, car lanterns, airplane lanterns..., tightly clutching the corners of adults' clothes and weaving through the crowd. Some groups of girls were squeezed, chirping and calling out. Rockets flew乱 everywhere in the sky, and a sea of lights on the ground reflected a hazy shadow. At this time, the stars and moon in the sky lost their brilliance, and people had another world in their hearts. Flowers were set off, there were airplanes, there were pavilions, and a woman even exploded from the pavilion, there were... there were some patterns I can't describe. In the eyes of someone like me who had never seen the world, this was truly amazing and miraculous. On the way home, I still heard dissatisfied complaints from the crowd. Fortunately, that night I struggled and was not squeezed into the river, and I came back covered in sweat.</p>
<p>So, although I heard that night was even more lively, I didn't dare to charge forward again. I could only bury myself in this quiet hut, letting the outside noisy sounds vibrate the window paper.</p>
<p>"Good, scars forgotten pain," this is used to describe people who are forgetful. Being able to forget the pain and find a little happiness in the midst of pain, this spirit is only possessed by the Chinese nation who "find joy in forgetting sorrow." The Lantern Festival expresses this spirit to the fullest!</p>
<h3>Dusk (11)</h3>
<p>— Qu Yi</p>
<p>"Chinese schools are always the same," said the skinny New Literature advocate, feeling this issue was excellent material for an article. He started with this sweeping statement, ready to expound with great emotion. "In Japan... In Japan, it's completely different. Chinese schools are full of factions. If you're wrong, I'll overthrow you, and I'll take over! Teachers in Chinese schools lack a national perspective. That... that national perspective!..."</p>
<p>"So, you two must be in the same faction then! You two?" Hu Yiyuan asked absentmindedly, his mind already wandering elsewhere. "It's a pity I didn't win the lottery. It's really damn annoying. Uncle! Do you think so? If that time, that time, we had agreed on the terms with that group, and let us issue a flood relief lottery... Sigh! Actually, even without that time, two weeks ago, when I went to Henan, if I had secured that deal, it would have been great! The local military and political circles wouldn't have been a problem at all, but Henan's side... Sigh! The General Chamber of Commerce is too difficult. The General Chamber of Commerce... But this stuff is really good. A grain of paper the size of a rice grain, placed on a cigarette, one puff, and you'll feel completely refreshed, completely... a complete and thorough refreshment..."</p>
<p>"Hmm, hmm!" This time, the pot-bellied uncle frowned, giving a definite reply. "Now is really the time to find a way out. Even my silver shop, sigh, it's so annoying! After the flood, there's another January 28th Incident! Although the January 28th Incident didn't reach this area, the main store suffered losses, sigh, sigh!..."</p>
<p>The pot-bellied uncle and the oval-faced nephew then began to talk about their business strategies as if they were "kindred spirits." But no one would believe that such a prosperous pot-bellied uncle had such a heavy burden of business worries.</p>
<p>The New Literature advocate, although finding this conversation a bit vague, usually studied national political economy quite a bit; he also joined in, saying:</p>
<p>"It's truly a combination of natural disasters and human-made disasters! Truly a combination of natural disasters and human-made disasters. In fact, Japan had no need to launch the January 28th Incident for its own sake! Old Li, do you agree?" Saying this, as if afraid of neglecting the attendant sitting on the side, he turned back to say hello to Li An.</p>
<p>But Li An just smiled, nodding slightly, not participating in this discussion about national affairs and people's livelihood.</p>
<p>"However!" But Hu Yiyuan turned around, wanting to give the New Literature advocate's words a twist, and plopped himself down on the long sofa; the pot-bellied uncle also sat back on the edge of the bed at the same time.</p>
<p>"However!" Hu Yiyuan said "however" again. But he couldn't think of how to continue, but in the sense of entertaining friends, he had something to say. "But do you like to smoke this?" Saying this, he stretched out his thumb and little finger into a straight line, making the shape of an opium pipe, and at the same time, put the tip of his thumb to his mouth.</p>
<p>"No, no!" Guo Ren immediately shook his head. "This is harmful to the nation's vitality. Absolutely not! Absolutely not! When I was in Japan, I!..."</p>
<p>"Then, let's have dinner served!" Hu Yiyuan then stood up with renewed energy, pressing the electric bell.</p>

<h3>Three Old Men's New Marriages</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Truly, there are news stories every year, and this year there are particularly many. Recently, several old men, finding it difficult to endure empty rooms and unwilling to be lonely, have married their spouses. This is also a romantic tale in the history of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Since Xiong Fenghuang and Mao Yanwen's marriage, many old men have been eager to try, shouting, "I'll do it too!" willing to be a Cao Aman who cuts off his beard and abandons his robe. Therefore, Mr. Zhang Hairuo, a former Hanlin scholar of the Qing Dynasty and former member of the Hubei Provincial Assembly, married Ms. Yang Sixin at the Dalu Chun restaurant on West Chang'an Street in Beiping the other day. Ms. Yang is skilled in literature, can play the qin and xiao, and is currently thirty-three years old, just like Mrs. Xiong, truly a unique coincidence.</p>
<p>According to a report on the 27th, Qi Xieyuan, the former Inspector General of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, is also scheduled to marry the eldest daughter of Hua Shikui, a famous calligrapher from Tianjin, on March 3rd. Qi is fifty-six years old, and Ms. Hua is forty-one years old, their ages are still similar, an old couple, a match made in heaven. Therefore, in these one or two months, three facts have occurred of old men becoming bridegrooms, truly wonderfully indescribable.</p>
<p>I once saw in Suiyuan Shihua that a certain old gentleman, newly marrying a concubine as beautiful as a flower, was overjoyed and composed two lines of poetry, saying, "I am already like a boat about to set sail, and you have come to be the one who raises the sail." I have forgotten this old man's name, because his poem is so wonderful that I can still remember it. However, since this old man has already had this enlightened statement, he may not have smooth sailing and set off easily, but when he cannot restrain his emotions, he may not have time to worry about the storms ahead.</p>
<p>Old men marrying wives was not often seen in the past. Now, because of legal restrictions, they are only allowed to marry one chief wife, not concubines. Therefore, new patterns have emerged, and old men have had to become bridegrooms. This is not because the old men of the past had ambition and the old men of today have no ambition. This phenomenon is entirely created by the environment. It is a pity that the long beard is completely cut off with a sharp knife. Truly, romantic love can make a hero lose his ambition.</p>
<p>Now, women are loudly advocating for equal rights between men and women, but no matter how equal it becomes, women will always be at a disadvantage in this one respect. We only see old men in their fifties and sixties marrying wives, but we do not see old women in their fifties and sixties marrying men. Wei Wenxiu's marriage to Mr. Wang, Wei's age is not even fifty or sixty years old, but she has already suffered attacks from society. But Wei was a concubine of President Li, so she married a businessman, and Mr. Wang may have other intentions. Otherwise, he would probably not dare to pursue her.</p>
<h3>A Neighbor from Fifteen Years Ago</h3>
<p>— Bu Yang</p>
<p>That was fifteen years ago.</p>
<p>For the convenience of studying, my family moved to L Town. Next door was the residence of a middle-aged couple. The woman was short in stature, and everything she did fully expressed the characteristics of a rural woman from the late Qing Dynasty. The man was a clerk in a soy sauce garden three miles away, always wearing a blue bamboo skirt over his long cloth robe, with the face of a small merchant accustomed to the counter, always smiling, easily pleasing the children.</p>
<p>At that time, I was also one of the children, and I loved to look at his smiling face like the others.</p>
<p>He was also quite popular with the adults, always behaving like a subordinate in front of my father, and my father often praised his good qualities. Because L Town was too remote, most of the letters my father sent were forwarded through his shop. Every four or five days, he would come back once. If my family had a letter, then he would first take off the blue bamboo skirt used for business, tidy up his long robe, and then come to my house. How eagerly he longed to take off the bamboo skirt and put on a mandarin jacket! Maybe he placed this hope on my father?</p>
<p>But my father, whose income wasn't very high and whose responsibilities were very heavy, was constrained by his circumstances and disappointed him.</p>
<p>Is this just a recollection now? A child's mind wouldn't think of these things. I still loved to play with him, pestering him to tell me the news from the street in the past three or five days. I remember one day after he finished telling the news, he wanted me to sleep at his house, but I refused. Later, he took out a few large copper coins from Hankou to coax me, and I agreed.</p>
<p>Everything in his house was quite tidy, but his age was probably older than my family's.</p>
<p>In this way, we lived as harmonious neighbors for three years. Due to circumstances, we moved a second time.</p>
<p>The long years of fifteen years have shaped me into an adult. From school to society, I have been busy with my own life, and I haven't seen him since.</p>
<p>On a foggy afternoon of accounting, my colleague Mr. Wang told me: There was a ragged person who wanted to see me. But when I saw him, I was stunned. The thin and old face, I couldn't remember who it was in my slow memory.</p>
<p>"You don't recognize me anymore, do you? I'm A Shao, who was your neighbor in L Town."</p>
<p>My gaze kept measuring his face. He gradually felt ashamed, stammering, introducing himself. At the same time, he also looked at me with fearful eyes. If it were on the road, I believe he wouldn't recognize me either.</p>
<p>I poured a cup of tea, and everyone was silently estranged by the long distance.</p>
<p>Someone over forty years old, but his face fully showed that he was an old man over sixty years old. His eye sockets were deeply sunken, able to hold two pigeon eggs, his cheekbones were high, his upper and lower teeth were scattered pitifully, and the mouth that could originally tell good stories was now flat like an old woman. He wasn't wearing a mandarin jacket, and even the original attire of a bamboo skirt over a long gown couldn't be maintained. He was wearing only a set of blue cloth short shirt and trousers, even though it was still a chilly spring.</p>
<p>Obviously, the past fifteen years have greatly changed his life.</p>
<p>Finally - he opened his mouth, the mouth like an old woman's lifted, and he told me: He lost his job in the soy sauce garden, and had been out of work at home with no way out. Now he really couldn't stand it anymore, thinking of coming to Shanghai to find work, but he happened to find a cook's job at a friend's place, 　 not enough　life　　　end of the month, can be領到, so ask you - temporarily deduct a few塊.</p>
<p>Afraid that I would reject his request, his two gray-yellow eyes were tightly fixed on my upper and lower lips.</p>
<p>I didn't know his life after parting, but from the goodwill of childhood, I had to believe that what he said was right; moreover, his desire was not great, so I agreed to him without hesitation and sent him to the door.</p>
<p>Another week passed.</p>
<p>In the reception room, I met him for the second time. He was still wearing the same set of clothes. He told me: The cook's job last time was temporary, and now that person has come out，</p>
<h3>Page 23</h3>
<p>, and couldn't find a second job, Shanghai can't stand it anymore, preparing to transfer, hoping I can help him one more time.</p>
<p>He also said: I myself am really embarrassed to open my mouth to you, but apart from you, I can't find anyone in Shanghai who can borrow money from.</p>
<p>My own income was really pitifully meager, and my wife was still clamoring to buy a more modern handbag, but the scene in front of me moved me. Isn't it better to help a person stranded in a foreign land to return home than to buy decorations for my wife? So, I helped him for the second time.</p>
<p>He walked! My heart was happy, like completing a task that humanity should do.</p>
<p>A month passed quietly from the calendar again.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, I saw him for the third time, like a completed task being destroyed. I began to get angry. I blamed him for not lying in front of someone who helped you, but unable to resist his plea, I finally overdrawn my salary for the next month to him.</p>
<p>The next day, a colleague saw him still wandering the streets.</p>
<h3>Donkey</h3>
<p>— Hua Mu</p>
<p>It is said that donkeys are very foolish and weak. But to what extent they are foolish and weak, I have rarely dabbled in books of zoology, but I am very vague. However, I remember that in a Chinese textbook that my grandfather taught me to read when I was seven years old, I read a fable about a donkey wearing a tiger skin, saying that the donkey admired the tiger's power. One day, it put the tiger skin on its body and went out to scare the beasts, and suddenly heard the tiger roaring behind the mountain. It hurriedly abandoned the skin and fled. Below was also a picture. At that time, I felt that the donkey was a very clever and interesting thing. I always thought, when will I also have a donkey to ride and play with. However, there were no donkeys in my hometown. Not only did no one raise donkeys, but few people knew what a donkey was. Therefore, I often thought of it, and my heart was always lost.</p>
<p>After that, as I grew older and could read ancient people's poems and articles, I also often found that ancient people were very fond of donkeys. When looking for flowers and scenery, they would not be without a donkey to take a step. Especially Lu Fangweng's sentence "Riding a donkey in the drizzle into Jianmen," I felt that the poetic and picturesque scenery was about to leap out. Naturally, I became even more interested in donkeys.</p>
<p>After coming to Shanghai, I thought I could always see donkeys. In the beginning, my grandfather said that there were also many donkeys in Jiangnan. But in the end, it disappointed me. Not only could I not see donkeys on the road, but it was also very difficult to see people riding horses. Therefore, my hopes turned to Suzhou. I often thought in my heart that riding a donkey in the misty rain in spring to explore Tiger Hill and tour Tianping would be poetic enough. Therefore, whenever the season of lush grass and flying orioles came to the world, it would evoke my strong longing to travel to Suzhou.</p>
<p>This beautiful dream lasted for four years, which I naturally felt very regrettable about. Unexpectedly, on this trip to Nanjing, I was able to see the donkey that I had been thinking about for more than ten years for the first time in Xiaguan.</p>
<p>However, my interest and goodwill towards donkeys were completely shattered.</p>
<p>Donkeys are really stupid, wretched, and awkward things! Hearing its鳴声 would make you tremble, it was so sad, so astringent, weak, and cowardly. Its short, uncoordinated body was unsteady when it ran. No wonder it can only carry heavy objects, unlike the horse's swiftness, which can gallop on the battlefield.</p>
<p>The era of the donkey is over. I will never think of riding a donkey to enjoy the scenery as an elegant and refined thing again. Because I am not an ancient person after all.</p>
<h3>Alleyway Song</h3>
<p>— Si Quan</p>
<p>Dragging my heavy steps into my own yard, when the golden sunlight reflected from the high wall in front of me, it was as if countless golden snakes were crowding in my mind. My wife had said that the animal that never sees the sun, today another situation is unfolding in front of me, but this situation is just like the afterglow of the setting sun, it is the time of the end of life.</p>
<p>My wife came out to meet me, and unexpectedly felt my frustrated look swallowed her innocent joke from her lips. We have been married for two years, and life has passed in joy. Today, this kind of pressure coming to our shoulders is a first-time experience.</p>
<p>Sitting in the room, a triangle of sunlight still hung on the wall. At this time, I couldn't help but be a fatalist. Usually, there are a few days of vacation every year, and when I get up to face the rising sun, my wife always counts on her fingers. She is also interested in my life of not seeing the sun, but thinks that we are often like guests and have too few opportunities to talk and laugh, so she is really unwilling to waste every hour of the few days of vacation. If today is a rare, unexpected day off, what a joyful gathering we will have tonight. My wife often hopes that I will change my job. Can you not say that your current situation is fate?</p>
<p>The sun gradually set, and the high wall was already a piece of lead gray. Wasn't my work place just starting to work? I vaguely heard the cry of life! The two of us just sat quietly in the room until we couldn't see each other's faces. My wife finally lit the electric light in the air that couldn't be oppressed, and asked me in the most gentle and subtle voice, "Do you feel uncomfortable?"</p>
<p>I stared at her face, her frightened pupils already storing unbearable clear tears, she knew there was an amazing news coming and forcibly鎮定着, has our joyous day ended like this? I asked myself, wanting to shout in the loudest voice "I'm unemployed!"安定 My heart that is about to explode, its pulse.</p>
<p>A sharp singing came from the entrance of the alley, and a painful image immediately flashed in front of my eyes. That singing, like a little girl's oriole, was squeezed out by an old man with almost white hair using a falsetto! Probably he and I have the same fate, and at sunset, life also begins. One day, a rare unexpected day off, when we were splitting雪梨 and eating, we heard a clear singing, and my wife asked me with a smile, "How old is this little girl?" I guessed sensitively, how did I know it was an old man over half a hundred years old. I also generously赐他 him a day's salary, he constantly称谢, at that time I felt太偉大!</p>
<p>Now the old man is still living with his falsetto, but I, a strong young man, is被失业的恐怖压迫着, can you not believe in fate? From tomorrow onwards, that old man is probably going to扣 my door, and 赐给给我 his song in exchange for a falsetto!</p>
<p>"I can see the sun every day"! I can't help shouting loudly, I'm about to be unable to breathe.</p>
<h3>Bathhouse</h3>
<p>— Jue Fu</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Writings of the Old Capital</p>
<p>I think the bathhouse in the old capital is the best place to pass the time. No matter who it is, as long as he goes inside to carefully experience it once or twice, and pays attention to the expression of carefree comfort on the faces of the naked customers, he will always feel that time is not worth anything there.</p>
<p>The facilities and hospitality inside the bathhouse are really admirable. In that spacious hall, dozens of couches are arranged very neatly, covered with clean white bedding, with a small and exquisite coffee table in the middle. One side of the hall is the barber shop, and the other side is the bathroom. As soon as you go in, someone will lead you to a couch, untie your clothes for you, and brew a pot of fresh tea and put it on the table. After you finish bathing, someone will offer a towel to wipe your back and face, and pour you a cup of clear tea and put it in front of you. When you want to leave, someone will shine your shoes, put on your clothes, and say a few polite words to you.</p>
<p>If you feel that the day is difficult to pass, and only then walk into the bathhouse, it is best to invite a friend to go in together. After undressing, you don't have to go into the tub so quickly. You can lie down on the couch at will, pick up the day's newspaper, and read it article by article. If you get tired of reading the newspaper, sit up, smoke a cigarette, drink tea, and chat casually with friends. If you still can't enjoy yourself like this, spend a dime or two, call the waiter to buy a few taels of white liquor, some peanuts and melon seeds, etc., to help the conversation, and it will be even more interesting. After drinking enough wine and finishing the melon seeds and peanuts, you can call the waiter to fill the bathtub with water. After taking a bath, if you think it's still early, you might as well put on a towel and lie down on the couch again, and have a good sleep. When you wake up, put on your clothes, pay the two-毛 bill, and walk out slowly to see your husband. The time of a day has passed unknowingly.</p>
<p>Some time ago in Guangzhou, I saw people spending only three or four 毛 to rent one or two newspapers, order a pot of tea, a plate of melon seeds, and two or three plates of snacks, and they could spend the day happily. I always thought that this was the cheapest and most comfortable way to pass the day; but now it still feels inferior to the bathhouse in the old capital!</p>
<h3>Short Essay</h3>
<p>— Lin Feng</p>
<p>In the morning, probably far from the朝阳 smearing red the treetops, the night's fog has not yet dissipated, outside the window, when I open the curtains, it is still hazy; some morning dogs' barking sounds as if it is still at night, the sky is a piece of white, without red cloud claws, gray and沉的. In the cold air of the morning, people are still sleeping.</p>
<p>Clang - clang - that's the camel bell, ringing in the 胡同. Such a steady and agile big animal,走上一日之程 again.</p>
<p>Autumn suburb, "There are断云 in the low sky," a large barracks looks gray from afar, and behind the barracks are many残碎的 tombs. There is a military bugle sound震荡 under the断云; the neighing of horses sent by the autumn wind is even more激厉.</p>
<p>I walked in those墓道, next to a 快平了's tomb, I found a long stake, with快要剥尽了's words on it: "Private soldier 某某 died of illness and was buried here." Next to it was also written the name of his hometown.</p>
<p>It is the sunset of the border town, the破碎的 city head, there is a military bugle sound荡起 from there, a gust of wind猛可地 sweeps to the city head, the person blowing the bugle, is lost in the gray dust, but the bugle sound is even more凄厉.</p>
<p>A team of soldiers蹈着 the sunset,迎着 the wind远了 in the bugle sound.</p>

<h3>The Various Ways Stars Memorize Lines (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Mi Qi</p>
<p>If you found the Italian comedian Enrico Ameri funny in his films, you haven't seen him when he memorizes his lines. He first runs like a wild horse, then slows down, gradually slowing to a normal walking pace. At that time, he begins reciting his lines. He often stretches out his giant palm and forcefully slaps his head, as if to pound the words of the lines into his brain, but the sound of the slapping is terrifying. Those nearby must think he is trying to commit suicide.</p>
<p>Will Rogers is a veteran after all. He never memorizes his lines in advance. When he arrives on the set, before filming begins, he asks in a grand manner, "What are we shooting today?" The director tells him, and he opens the script, reads it once or twice, and then begins to perform. But he is extremely talented, and if there are unnatural or inappropriate parts in the dialogue, he automatically changes them without consulting the director first. By the time a scene is finished, the dialogue is often completely different from the original words, but it is always better. Of course, Will Rogers is an exception, and not one that ordinary actors can imitate.</p>
<p>But there is another famous actor, who can be compared with Will Rogers, whose behavior is also similar. That is Wallace Beery. He never remembers his lines, because his memory is so bad that he simply doesn't bother trying. Before filming, he glances at the lines of the dialogue and remembers the general idea. That way, he can go on stage. When he is acting, he can "freely" improvise. But the words he improvises are extremely smooth and fluent, without any forced or unnatural flaws.</p>
<p>Ralph Bellamy's memory is extremely fast. Many actors, such as James Cagney, Margaret Sullavan, Gary Cooper, Norma Shearer, Alan Hale, George Raft, John Beal, etc., can be classified as having fast memories. Ralph Bellamy reads the entire script once, then reads ten pages at a time. Because of his deep experience on the stage, he only needs to read it three or four times to remember it. This kind of ability is not considered rare in the theater world, because many stage actors can memorize the entire script from beginning to end, word for word, after reading it a few times.</p>
<p>Mae West has only one place where she can memorize lines, and that is on her chaise lounge. Even when she is on the set, if the lines need to be added or subtracted temporarily, if it is important, she must retreat to her dressing room, lie on her chaise lounge, and re-memorize the newly revised lines. She says that only on a soft couch can her whole body be relaxed, and then with her eyes closed, she can imprint the words into her brain.</p>
<p>Joan Crawford and Alice Faye both practice their lines in front of a full-length mirror. Joan Crawford pays the most attention to her body posture. She must rotate left and right, finding the most appropriate position. Alice Faye pays the most attention to the movement of her mouth. When she speaks, she makes various facial expressions in order to achieve the most natural expression.</p>
<p>Shirley Temple's lines are taught to her by her mother. Every night, her mother reads her tomorrow's lines as a story, and has her read along again and again, until she can say it herself, and then she goes to sleep. Before going to the set the next morning, her mother has her say it again. But she rarely says a word wrong. All the child stars, such as Cora Sue Collins and Pepe Knerr, are taught by their mothers. But their memories are extremely strong, surpassing those of many adults.</p>
<p>After Marette LeLancheur died, the old queen of the screen, May Robson, whose memory is almost a form, and the positions of her lines, their length, and specific words, so that page of dialogue is already captured in her eyes. She can capture many pages in a row, and not forget a single word after going on stage, because she can "see" each word on each page from her heart!</p>
<p>Glenda Farrell used to like to read her lines aloud, so she could hear her own voice and determine whether it was correct or not. She practiced her lines for the next day every night until she felt she couldn't improve any further, and then forgot everything. Before filming began, she took out the script and looked at it again.</p>
<p>Jean Harlow is meticulous in everything. She reads the script carefully as many as fifteen times. But she doesn't deliberately try to memorize it, but lets the words naturally imprint in her brain after familiarizing herself with them. Warner Baxter also rehearses constantly to achieve perfection. Warren William always carries the script in his hand, whether driving, eating, playing, or walking.</p>
<p>In short, everyone has their own special habits. Everyone uses his or her own special method to firmly remember the lines that they should recite. I do what I do, regardless of whether others find it funny. This is a glimpse of the various types in Hollywood. (The End)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Forsaking All Others"</h3>
<p>— You Jing</p>
<p>Nanjing Screening</p>
<p>First, I would like to mention the color cartoon "Discontented Canary" that was shown before "Forsaking All Others."</p>
<p>After the canary, dissatisfied with its caged life, flies back to the freedom of the sky, it first encounters the cruel black cat amidst endless joy. When hungry, it learns to suck nectar like a bee, but is stung by the bee. When cold, it follows the pigeons back to their nest, but is rejected. Thus, in the wind and rain, it loses its roost, and is bullied by the black cat, almost losing its life. Finally, it staggers back to its cage. At this time, the stove in the owner's house is burning warmly. The neighbor's parrot swallows the food thrown by the owner on its perch, and says, "Oh, you..."</p>
<p>This ancient, didactic fable, produced with the techniques of cinematic art, beautiful colors, and "consummate skill," satisfies the audience with its insights.</p>
<p>The story of "Forsaking All Others" is very simple, writing about the love entanglement between two men and a woman who have grown up together since childhood in a vivid and winding way.</p>
<p>Naturally, with such good material conditions, and excellent actors who can act, it is not difficult to achieve the success that it is now showing. If the so-called success of a film is limited to this, if it is only limited to technical success, then...</p>
<p>For audiences familiar with Joan Crawford, Clark Gable, and Robert Montgomery, there is no need to say more about their acting skills. Here, in the love entanglement, they all skillfully use all their uninhibited passion and vibrant youth to act out the pursuit, debauchery, the pain of heartbreak, and the satisfaction of triumph.</p>
<p>Director W.S. Van Dyke, in addition to using concise shots, lively editing, and focusing on the urgent process of the protagonist's acting, also painstakingly uses the supporting roles as a successful active background. For example, the role of Jeff's friend, one of the young men, is an indispensable background in their urgent moments. His silent standing and casual sitting represent a lot of the drama. Here, there are two weddings and two dance parties with large scenes, and the director is able to touch them appropriately, without lengthening unnecessary shots to exaggerate, so as to weaken the tension of the plot's progress. Similarly, after the heroine's first heartbreak, when she lives in the countryside, riding horses, driving, and swimming to relieve her mental distress, he does not waste film on the heroine's physical display.</p>
<p>Naturally, the direction of the entire film is not without its shortcomings. For example, the scene where the car breaks down and it rains, and the two stay in the abandoned house in the wilderness, is too long and boring, and has to use unnecessary slapstick and fires to make gimmicks.</p>
<p>The dialogue, photography, and sound effects are all quite complete.</p>
<h3>Review of "Broadway Bill"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Cathay</p>
<p>Frank Capra, this great cinematic technician, the technical success of each of his works is truly worthy of our sincere admiration. He is a completely skilled film technician, he is a successful director, at least in his directing techniques, there is no reason for us to deny this.</p>
<p>From "Lady for a Day" to "It Happened One Night", we have long recognized this great technician. There is never a true story in his works, and there are no characters that we usually see in his works, but he is a great liar, and he can use his vivid cinematic techniques to achieve the effect of making us unable to believe a fictional story that we dare not believe. The poor old apple-selling woman in "Lady for a Day" becomes a millionairess with the enthusiastic help of the people. Her enthusiasm moves the hooligans and also moves the honorable mayor. In "It Happened One Night," that pair of wandering men and women, with their nonsensical skills, make up all sorts of so-called fragrant and romantic things. Those are all things that we dare not believe. But when we are in the cinema, we are completely fascinated. Although we know that those are all lies, this lie, told by the skilled liar Capra, is just like the truth. (Until we walk out of the theater, what remains in our hearts is a beautiful pleasure, but this pleasure soon dissipates, because we finally feel that it is a lie without any authenticity!)</p>
<p>In this "Broadway Bill" (the name of Broadway Bill) is just like the above two works, completely maintaining a consistent style. The character who appears in this film is the son-in-law of a rich man. He is not used to the rich man's old-fashioned restraints. He loves horse racing, wandering, and so, with his cleverness, he leaves that stubborn family and lives a debauched life with his sister-in-law. It is almost unnecessary to explain that a young man who abandons a comfortable life and willingly wanders is definitely not a commonly seen character. As for the theme of the play, leaving a wealthy family to wander for love and for one's own hobbies is not necessarily commendable in any way. In all respects, there is no lovely content here. In other words, we are not interested in just looking at the story in the description, but he skillfully structures the story into a completely organized cinematic art, and with his vivid directing techniques, what is expressed on the screen here is really too touching for us, that is to say, the expression of the emotions of cinematic art is really too successful.</p>
<p>When we appreciate it as a study of cinematic art, we can learn a lot from the technical success of this film. He is so meticulous in arranging the air or atmosphere of each scene, he is so clear in depicting the personalities of the characters in the play, he is so appropriately harmonious in adjusting the speed (Tempo) fast and slow. If we want to study the weaving method of American films, this film is an excellent textbook.</p>
<p>As for the acting skills of "Warner Oland, Myrna Loy, or Lionel Barrymore, under his guidance, their success is, of course, needless to say."</p>

<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>Crand Old Girl (6)</h3>
<p>— Shu Min</p>
<p>Lu Lan Beiers thought, and couldn't help but smile. If Jilliken takes care of "Front Room," then victory is guaranteed! The victory of "Front Room" is the failure of Clarence Dade. It's not that she has any hatred for Dade, that she must make him fail, but she must protect her children. Once Sandy came. Miss Beiers was paying when the door opened again. Sandy and Miss Beiers were both surprised, and it turned out that Jillie Gerlai came in, followed by a group of her henchmen. At first, Miss Beiers still had extravagant hopes, and she whispered to Sandy: "I feel that we have already achieved complete victory." But Sandy frowned, looking at Jillie with great suspicion. He said: "Don't be happy yet, things are not over yet."</p>
<p>That's right, those people's faces all had an unconvinced look. They first ran to Dade's place, which was cold and lifeless. So they ran to this "Front Room" to cause some trouble. Jilly was the first to make trouble, she asked Sandy to dance with her. Miss Beiers didn't know that she had bad intentions, so she smiled and said to Sandy: "That couldn't be better." She said to Jilly again: "Jilly, I'm so glad you came. Please come often in the future." Jilly said proudly: "I have a good place to go." In order to avoid quarrels, Sandy immediately walked up to Jilly. Jilly grabbed his arm and started dancing. While dancing, she said to Sandy: "I hope you dance as well as you throw ice cream buckets." After they danced for a while, Jilly said again: "I never thought I'd have the blessing to dance with you today."</p>
<p>Sandy looked at her fiercely, and then said: "Jilly, why aren't you smarter? You just need to give yourself a small chance, and you'll be a girl that can't be bettered." Jilly spat: "Pah, who wants to be a good girl?" Sandy said solemnly: "Jilly, I think you are pretending everywhere, acting all the time, lest people don't pay attention to you." Jilly said angrily: "Oh, you say I'm pretending?" Sandy said: "I know, so I like you to come to this place, because in this place, you have to abide by some rules." Jilly said: "Maybe... or not!" She pushed Sandy away and started dancing a rumba by herself. All of a sudden, the order was in chaos.</p>
<p>Sandy stepped forward, wanting to stop Jilly from dancing that wild dance, but Jilly's henchmen rushed up and kicked Sandy, knocking him to the ground. Miss Beiers was so anxious that she kept wringing her hands, unable to shout to stop them. Just as it was in this chaotic mess, the door opened again. Joseph Gerlai, Gabe Lent, and the local dignitaries all came in. They came to see what kind of place Miss Beiers' "Front Room" was, and how beneficial it was to the children. But when they saw this kind of scene, everyone became angry. Gerlai shouted: "Shameful!"</p>
<p>But before he could say the second sentence, Jilly and her henchmen had already slipped away like a gust of wind. They all jumped into Jilly's sports car and sped away. Sandy also came out, driving a truck to chase after them. Only Miss Beiers was left in "Front Room" to receive the reprimands and shame of the big shots.</p>
<p>After a while, Sandy's truck had already caught up with Jilly's sports car, because the sports car had run out of gas. Everyone saw Sandy's truck catching up, and it was just right, everyone called him to take them back to the city. But Sandy unhurriedly jumped out of the truck, gently lifted Jilly up, and placed her next to the driver's seat. Before anyone could react, Sandy had already jumped up, immediately turned the car around and drove away, letting the children walk back by themselves. (To be continued)</p>
