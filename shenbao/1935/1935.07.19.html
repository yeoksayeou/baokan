<p>時評</p>
<h3>英美果能合作乎</h3>
<p>— 紀</p>
<p>英美合作聲浪。喧傳已久。其間消息之斷斷續續。問題之盤根錯節。實使一般注意時事問題者。有不可捉摸之感。最近遠東問題。突吿緊張。而國際和平運動。亦漸爲各國學術界與與論界所注意。於是英美合作論調。又甚囂塵上。據國民社消息。華盛頓當局曾於本月十四日公開宣稱。「美國與英國卽將實行密切合作。以維護世界和平。而此項合作之實。現且將較近年來任何時期爲有力」云云。</p>
<p>英美之合作。固爲吾人所樂聞。而英美合作之成功。亦足轉扳近頃之國際形勢。第吾人縱覽史實。殊覺英美之對立。早已成爲現今資本主義根本上之對立。當茲狹隘國家主義聲浪高唱入雲之際。英美之能否推誠相與。以維持國際和平關係於萬一。恐尙屬疑問。茲請進而論之。</p>
<p>第一。先就經濟方面言。自世界經濟會議失敗以來。英美矛盾早已走上無可調和之途徑。戰債問題延未解决。而通貨貶值之鬥爭又起。此外如增高關稅壁壘。關閉商品與原料市塲。均足使兩國貿易上之爭奪。更形惡化。現今英美兩國在中國·澳大利·亞印度·加拿大·以及拉丁美洲諸國之市塲。無論貿易上投資上無不發生直接或間接之衝突。此種市塲爭奪之激化。實使通貨戰爭。日益劇烈。兩國矛盾日益加深。</p>
<p>第二。就政治方面言。兩國經濟對立之惡化形成政治意見之鑿柄。自爲必然之事實。現今英美政治上之明爭暗鬥。幾無時或已。對遠東問題之意見既未能一致。對拉丁美洲及加拿大政治上之操縱。尤各具陰謀。美國對歐洲問題。表面上雖以不干涉主義爲既定之原則。實際上則仍有待時而動之意。使英國不得不有所顧忌。</p>
<p>第三。就軍備方面言。英國之主張。在保持其傳統的海上霸權地位。而美國之立塲。則在完成其海軍之最優勢計畫。去年倫敦海軍預備會方在進行之際。英國之總噸數主義與美國之大艦大砲政策。幾成短兵相接之勢。卒使海軍會議無期延會。而列國之造艦競爭。成爲公開之事實。</p>
<p>以上數端。皆犖犖大者。由此足知英美合作之舉。其前途之暗礁重重。非兩國各放棄其自我之立塲。决無根本成就之可言。</p>
<p>雖然。英美兩國之根本合作。固無實現之可能。但局部合作。則未始不能見諸事實。就吾人觀測英美局部合作之可能性有二。一爲東亞獨占危機之滋長。又一則爲日貨「世界的傾銷」之增大。使英美之固有市塲。感受嚴重之威脅。此種經濟上之對日衝突。現已日趨劇烈。則英美兩國在共同之立塲上。終當有一致之步驟耳。</p>

<h3>阿比西尼亞問題　意國態度緩和　不復反對國聯干涉英法步驟趨於一致現在問題集中路權</h3>
<p>（巴黎）此後數日內、意阿爭案四周之空氣可望大有進步、路透電社探悉、此種變動將出於意國緩和反對國聯干涉之方式、法政府似巳取確定之方針、贊成日內瓦調解、蓋英國曾促請法總理兼外長賴伐爾也、據羅馬傳來外交機密消息、一切豫兆頗佳、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯秘書長愛文諾今日致電行政院理事國家、準備於七月二十五日至八月二日出席特別會議、考慮意阿爭端、該電曾確切言明、國聯將考慮干涉此事云、（十七日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）國聯於七月二十五日召開會議討論意阿爭執之說　漸爲有力、國聯秘書長愛文諾今日下午曾與賴伐爾總理會商、據消息靈通方　宣稱二人討論意阿問題及國聯行政院於七月二十五日召開會議問題、此間漸信解決糾紛之最善方法、莫若聽任國聯執行其五月間通過之議决案、雖使意國之政策引起各國之共憤、因而產生其他後果、亦所有恤云、（十七日國民電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）聞阿王願以沃迦丹省之一部分割讓意國、意當局已嚴詞拒絕考慮此議、蓋以沃迦丹省爲一沙漠、全不合殖民之用也、消息靈通者現稱、啣接伊里特里與意屬索瑪里倫二地之鐵路、若不以軍隊佔領、則該路將常發生危險、而無用云、駐羅馬英大使德魯蒙爵士今日復與意相墨索里尼會談、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）自阿比西尼亞國皇帝要求美國根據非戰公約干涉意阿爭端、經美國婉辭謝却後、英美兩國間正由外交途徑商談阿國問題、一般人相信美國雖自認並無干涉之義務、但其主要目標則爲援助英國之調解工作、俾意阿爭端得以解决、消息靈通方面相信美國政府、或將派觀察員前來日內瓦云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>阿皇聲明　希望國聯處理　事前不作外交接洽</h3>
<p>（倫敦）阿比西尼亞皇帝昨向泰唔士報訪員發表談話、用以說明該國對於意阿爭端現狀之觀點、其言曰「阿國希望國聯會行政院能於七月二十五日、討論此項爭端、在行政院有所决定之前不作何項外交活動、意阿混合仲裁委員會若能在七月二十五日之前重行開會、阿國自當靜候結果、幷擬建議一種新程序、英國若向阿國直接有所建議、阿國自願加以答復、關於意阿爭端、阿國對英法意三國在一九〇六年所訂之條約、實認其爲維持和平之工具、但意國首相墨索里尼調兵運械繼續不已、其本人幷有親來東菲之說、則一九〇六年修約、雖欲加以運用、亦且無從着手又况此項條約僅有英國一國從而加以擁護乎、至於進行談判之方式各方迄無任何建議、英國外相霍爾及不管部閣員艾登二氏態度、阿國實所贊同、英國欲保持行動自由、以便對於樹立和平一點、有所貢獻、吾人毫不非議之、至自意屬伊里特里築一鐵道通過阿國、以達意屬索謀里蘭一層、意大利政府未有此項提議、他國政府亦從無此項主張、阿國政府對此問題、仍願一加討論、」關於割讓領十問題、阿國皇帝之態度、極爲鮮明、以爲交換領土則可、如僅以割讓爲事、則阿國决難承認、謂「英國如仍願將才拉港予阿國、則阿國將相等土地讓予意大利、但此項領土、究指何處、尙未决定、要之阿國北境領七、决無割讓之可能、」按阿國皇帝上次遊歐之際、曾表示該國有在紅海獲得海口之必要、茲又謂此一問題對於阿國、實有特別重要之關係、阿帝最後又云「意大利威脅和平、已昭然若揭、該國若果對阿宣戰、並將其軍隊開入阿境、則阿國政府一面立卽應戰、一面卽當向國聯會呼籲」云云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>開羅　此間阿拉伯罕報紙、登載阿王談片、謂如埃及准許意國軍用飛機越過埃境、則渠將認此爲非友好之舉動蓋此實便利意國侵略阿國之活動也、阿國現仍望能和平解决此次爭議、但亦準備出全力以維持其本國之獨立云、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）據沃佛爾報外交記者都巴麗夫人之觀察、國聯秘書長愛文諾主張英法兩國政府與意國開三角會議討論意阿問題已歸失敗、都氏並稱、此項建議本可爲法國接受、但因英意兩國之態度終成畫餅、英政府仍要求將爭端提交國聯解决、故國聯行政院在七月二十五日召開會議勢已無可避免、法國駐意大使探詢意國方面之眞意、亦無效果、蓋墨索里尼首相僅稱、欲維護意國之尊嚴、拾討伐阿國外別無他法、此外卽拒絕再有表示、墨索里尼不願繼續進行交涉、但最後或有接受和解之可能、都氏爲使意國利用國聯起見、主張意國應向國聯提出證據、證明其所提出之阿國罪狀、如破壞條約、及奴隸貿易、確係事實云、（十八日國民電）</p>
<h3>墨索里尼表示　以武力爲終始　羅馬發表新事件經過</h3>
<p>米蘭　首相墨索里尼今日在其手創之意大利人民報上著論、謂意阿爭端「旣因武力而起、必須以武力結東」云、（十七日國民電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）五月三十一日、有阿比西尼亞土着一隊、曾向意屬伊里特里邊界唐迦里地方之意兵防地、施行襲擊、以致釀成新爭端、茲官方發表此案經過詳情云、是日夜間、有屬於「達謨希答」及「阿萊答」兩部落、與來自高原一帶之阿比西尼亞人越過邊界、突然侵入意屬伊里特里境內「瑪特拉」平原地方、並向意屬各部落土、施行襲擊、意兵聞訊、立卽趕到、當將阿人擊退、是役有牧人及婦孺多名、爲阿國土人擊斃、並掠去牲畜四千頭、人口若干、隨被架去、作爲奴隸、迨意國駐薩勃港軍隊得報、派隊馳往肇事地點、則阿國土人業已越境遠颺矣（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英國軍事準備　保護菲洲屬地　惟軍力無須增加</h3>
<p>（倫敦）殖民大臣麥唐納瑪爾孔今日向下院聲稱、如意阿開戰、則英國已準偏保誕其非洲屬地之邊境、並謂甘耶地方之軍隊調動係預防意外、惟屬地軍力無須增加云、（十七日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）上議院開會、根據國聯會報吿書、討論阿比西尼亞奴隸制度、經薛西爾勛爵白克斯登勛爵及坎德伯賚大主敎先後發言、爲阿國廢止奴隸制度、進行遲緩情形解說、譵對阿皇所作努力表示稱贊、白克斯登勛爵譵說明阿國境內奴隸制度之存在「不能援爲侵略阿國之口實」云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>國聯制製問題　委員會擬成報告書</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯行政院委派審肖經濟制裁之小組委員會案已討論完畢、並已草成報吿、即可向十三人委員會提出、該會目的在增加集體保安制之效力、該會將於七月廿四日開會、討論報吿中之建議、該報吿分析預防計劃及實施制裁、甚爲明晣認禁制販運及製造軍火用之原料係預防劃、而實際制裁、或將完全與毁約國斷絕通商關係、但此項普遍禁例不應施於人民營養所必需之物品、該報吿並載稱、若干國家或將不參此項制裁、故　設法阻止此項中立國以軍火原料供給毁約國云、小組委員會本身對於其建議之能否收　亦不無懷疑、該報吿結論稱、提出之各項建議或將引起種種寶、但此適足證明小組委員會工作之艱巨云、（十五日國民電）</p>
<h3>英皇御艇假導　艦隊入海作戰　商船隊第一次參加操演</h3>

<p>（倫敦）國王喬五世、今晨　波茨茅斯軍港檢閱海軍、演習射擊時、第一次表演艦隊轟擊自動飛機情形、其法係　飛機兩架、先用放射器投送空際、　後利用無綫電加以指揮使之自由　翔、兩機中一機未及上昇　卽行傾落、一機則往來飛翔、頗爲自然、於是各艦紛紛　砲、最後被裝甲艦「羅德尼號之高射砲擊中該機上翼、遂卽落下、此外復表演轟擊巡洋艦情形、　辦法係將「望第德」號巡洋艦、亦用無綫電加以駕駛、使各艦用爲射擊之靶、總計發砲二百二十響、其中五十六響擊中「望第德」號艦身云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）自賴伐爾之二十八道緊急法令頒布至今、已有二十四小時、一般人士之批評、及報章之輿論、漸見增加、最初一般意見、皆謂政府此種措置、勇敢果斷、實足欽佩、稍後則覺政府對於公員薪俸以及他種恩給之削减已超過人民之期望、且此等人十收入减少之後、生活費用能否同時减低、實爲一大問題、社會黨與其產黨之報紙、對於止等法令一致抨擊、主張各官吏及公務員起　反　、鐵路員工及公務員聯合會現皆一致反對、並定於明日在某戲院前集會、討論應付辦法雖政府禁止一切露天集會、亦置若罔聞國會方面、亦深爲不然、巴黎迥聲報評此種辦法、亦謂犧牲過人、恐每一法人、皆將受其影響、再則政府此種復興經濟之嘗試、設其再行失敗、則勢將陷法國於破產、日報則謂、此種法令實爲政府恢復經濟地位大刀闊斧之行動小巴黎人報謂、賴伐爾必將以其過人之手腕智慧與自信、促使此等法令之實現、而七月十六實可視爲法國維護通貨復興經濟之一大關鍵、（十八日國民電）</p>

<h3>紗花　現紗產量减縮聲中　川帮銷路蟬聯不斷</h3>
<p>紗市頗挺、局勢益覺良好、因現紗銷塲益暢、蜀帮搜羅尤切、紗廠停車及歇業者甚衆、棉紗產量大减、現紗根子愈見緊抽、市面犬有提高之勢、但多數賣紗買花之投機商、安然不動、就目前狀態而論、八月期標紗、或有七十元之希望、</p>
<p>金鷄徐徐上騰</p>
<p>標紗開盤、各月又呈平滯、長豐又來拋出、檯面平常、近遠月均跌二三角、拍至二盤、塲內市氣依然閑敬多說日商又來拋賣、人氣不振、續跌三四角、但拍至三收盤、因原棉狂漲、各方現紗銷路接踵而來且交易所中籌碼物生意尤俏、塲中人心複振、買氣突盛、市盤忽然上騰、結果各月比上日收盤價均漲二四五七角至一元、查賣出振大五百包、賡豐五百包、長餘四百包、仁豐四百五十包、長豐二千一百五十包、信誠六百包、買進通記五百包、益大一千〇五十包、明德七百包、愼記一千〇五十包、益昶五百五十包、潤康四百五十包、德記五百包、一日問最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>近期花軋空愈顯明</h3>

<p>浮空爭補一瞥</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、各月形勢仍平、近月長豐拋賣而疲但拍至遠月較緊、漲一角至二角、二三盤買氣驟起、空頭在近月抵補、多頭不願放出、市盤乃愈開愈漲、至於新棉、謂漢口水患深刻、年成僅有二成把握、於是買者尤衆、檯而俏利而漲、結果各月比上日收盤價均漲四角半五角半六角、查賣出梅記二千六百擔、通記二千八百擔、源大三千三百擔、均昶一千八百擔、益昶一千八百擔、長豐三千九百擔、澗康一千七百擔、源興昌二千二百擔、買進大孚一千九百擔明德一千九百擔、賡豐一千三百擔、同豐三千三百擔、愼記三千六百擔、元一一千二百擔、大昌成一千四百擔、生源一千三三百擔、信誠一千三百擔、新華一千擔、益康二千三百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<p>（滬南）昨各帮來源愈到愈少、祇共抵六號（貨共千來石）人心略定、市况以物稀轉定、形勢似有帶堅之象、雖本街銷化平常、包胃祇納二三百包、結果各厚粳及薄稻價鮮高者已見鮮色、中市貨悉　定局、至若陰變元、更以遂日價盤跌透、現有動動、其市色頓見回升三尺、杜尖無榮辱、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨河下各路來源千號左右、市上各種去骨、白粳續化、價形高料定勢、中次緊起近角、薄稻貨稀價漲一二角、早稻定局、自元零銷頗活、情形又漲三四角、其餘各貨、無甚上落、</p>
<h3>洋米中次貨續小角許</h3>
<p>昨洋米市况、形勢復見不振、實因長江都雖日有辦裝、而銷數絕少、不似內地幇成千累萬之夥、寗波帮日有中次各擋之問津、然甬地高米滯銷、反運來申求售、　面之不振者董爲此池、昨小絞與中次各擋去化見淡、而高西貢反無囤戶求脫、因此高擋各米尙可站定、其他續小角許、全市去化共計七千多包、由漢口九江南京寗波本街等分去、內地帮巳完全停頓、</p>
<h3>豆餅盤旋黃荳帶疲</h3>
<p>昨豆餅勢居盤旋、廠餅現出者廠盤尙穩、惟回籠貨較軟、近幾日各餅去路尙熱鬧、昨開廠餅六千八百餘片、　餅一萬三千餘片、因大暑伊邇、銷塲例盛、故前途趨勢、尙有幾番變遷、黃荳廠胃、東省荳塞飽、一時並無整數辦胃、祇靠本街等零星去化、市無特色、</p>
<h3>絲茶　珍眉綠茶轉趨活潑</h3>
<p>路莊士莊等路之珍眉綠茶、本星期來、銷路略見淸淡、但茶額不多、市面尚無變化、昨錦隆保昌永興華茶等行、對於婺源屯溪歙縣溫州土莊等路貨、又復開辦、市勢轉活、惟抽芯貨、市面略佔優勝、至其他針屑鳳眉蝦目貢獻等花色、各莊亦均有零星去胃、局勢仍趨堅定、寗州紅茶、昨由德莊興成洋行辦進六百餘箱、市盤做開三十元、較前見低七八元、</p>
<h3>南北貨　新金菜號盤轉鬆</h3>
<p>金針菜自新貨登塲以來、初以廣帮去胃頗旺、極爲平定、茲聞粵港市價轉降、去胃已呆、而申市如鎭江來之大興菜仰花菜鄉莊菜衆興菜等、到數轉增、徐州菜亦陸續有到、行盤號一致見降、自元許至數角不等、地價因亦隨鬆云、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗砂白略漲五分</h3>
<p>昨日糖市、以關金步緊轉堅、公會劃盤二四粗砂白現貨以十六元成交一百包、比升五分、轉口貨呌四元八角、大古糖B嘜叫十七元三角、未成、本廠綿白亦叫升五分、一號爲十五元三角、號貨有潮帮續開正綿赤一百餘包、價爲十元〇六角、無甚上落、又枝洋白六十餘包、十二元二角半、餘乏成交、</p>
<h3>疋頭　呢絨厚貨不絕裝到</h3>
<p>秋冬需銷之呢羢厚貨、麥爾登平厚呢·直貢華特呢·套頭呢中厚嗶嘰·企呢馬褲呢·人字呢衣呢之　、邇來洋行方面、到貨陸續、其中虹拆貨帮定到者占多數、各洋行現貨占有三成、古棧及招商北棧　山棧等、近日因之堆貨日增、</p>
<h3>雜訉　瓊州牛皮久斷有到</h3>
<p>瓊州牛皮、前因匯水不合、到貨久乏、茲申瓊匯價見長、成本漸輕、市價已漸接近、昨慶元輪入口、到有十餘件、因此市勢看鬆、而仰光皮前價本不共上下、邇來開價反低、頗爲軋缺、查瓊州皮前價沙紅皮爲六十二三元、水紅皮四十二三元、白背皮五十一二元、此次新到之貨、照市象而論、大約有看降二三元譜、一時防難成盤</p>
<h3>五金　竹節鋼條回好不易　建築業衰淡影響</h3>
<p>四十尺長竹節鋼條、爲建築帮切需品、惟近來本埠地價頻跌、致建築工程亦因之而大减、外　容商亦以農村崩潰、經濟恐慌、况最近水災遍地、以此需用此種建築材料亦大减、且市貨頻到、存積奇豐、同業因經濟關係、亦有願廉價脫手消息、惜購辦者寥寥、致標準受不良環境影響、致有每况愈下之嘆、行情扯花色每頓開九十元、單零行情自一百零五元至八十七元不一、查近三日來、市上開出祇四五十噸而已、比之暢盛時代减落三分之一、故欲望其市面之轉機、恐一時不易回好也、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （朱慰萱）</p>
<p>小商號的關店大拍賣，差不多已成爲一九三九年新興的一種廣告術，因爲他們雖則天天在喊關店，但是結果是很少實現的；倒是平日專門自吹資本雄厚，營業繁盛的大公司大銀行，反而當會迅雷不及掩耳的倒閉；而且事前大都諱莫如深，絕無風聞，這大概就是所謂大公司與小商號之別吧？</p>
<p>語云：「仁者見仁，智者見智」！這是形容各人所見，自是不同，所以爲人切勿以個人主觀的見解，來批評人家的好壞；往往嫖賭吃着傾家蕩產誰都認爲壞人的浮浪子，在倡門裏賭場裏也常會被認爲好人的！</p>
<h3>爲甚麽靠左走</h3>
<p>— 佩瑜</p>
<p>記得新生活運動中，有一項信條是「走路要靠左走。」立這項信條的用意，大概是要避免擁擠而使有秩序；但是爲甚麼不靠右而一定要靠左呢？假使道路上車輛靠右行，人們也靠右走，不是同樣地可得到避免擁擠而使有秩序的效果麼？據一位英國的考據家，費了一番研究工夫，考據出很近情理，很有趣味的道理來了。他說靠左走和人體的生理上有密切關係的。</p>
<p>這裏，我們先來研究一個問題，爲甚麼我們大多數的人，善於用右手呢？據說因爲我們身軀內最重的器官「肝，是生在右面的緣故。因肝生在右面，我們便很容易的從右面轉身到左面。這樣，古時的人發覺用右手來揮舞一根棍棒，或投射一塊石子，比較左手來得容易些，經過許多時代之後，右手繼續地比左手容易訓練。</p>
<p>用手是這樣，騎馬却是相反。從左面就是和生肝的方面相反的一面，跨上馬背去，並且靠近路的一邊，騎馬比較安全些。所以馬路上靠左走的規則，是在從前人人騎馬的時候傳下來的。但在英國的鋪道上却要靠右走的，因爲在鋪道的右邊，從馬上或車上跨下來，比較容易些。馬路的規則「靠左走」，鋪道的規則「靠右走」，都是因騎馬與生理的關係而來的。</p>
<h3>木魚和龍舟歌</h3>
<p>— 闌刪</p>
<p>日前在本刊讀到張翊德君「木魚」一稿，把我們廣東民間的文學介紹了出來，佩服佩服。只是張君在文中有多少地方是誤會了的，亦有語焉未詳的，茲分別補充改正如下。</p>
<p>張君說「木魚」好像短篇的小品文藝，彈詞」好像長篇的章回小說，這就錯了。其實「木魚」是一種最冗長的分段歌曲，正似章回小說，整本唱起來非費全天以上的時候不可。但是，像短篇小說及小品文藝的，却是另外的一種，不叫「木魚」，便是很爲聞名的「龍舟歌」。</p>
<p>正因爲「木魚」太長之故，不是人人會唱的。而「龍舟歌」則短小精悍，哀怨纏綿，誰也記得而且喜歡哼它兩齣。</p>
<p>「木魚」如「紫霞杯」，「玉葵寶扇，」「背解紅羅」「梁山伯祝英台」等等眞是洋洋大觀，數萬字至十餘萬字皆有。老太太吃過了夜飯，給媳婦婢僕等恿慫着，便帶上老花眼鏡，唱了起來，一句鐘之內，可唱四五段。</p>
<p>而龍舟歌則不然，誰也會唱，我們被稱做「阿少」的固然會，卽丫環僕婦也行。最普通的是「客途秋恨，」「陳世美不認妻」，「賓玉哭靈」和「何惠羣嘆五更」等是。</p>
<p>「春蠶到死絲還有，銀燭成灰淚未收，好姻緣　成就，結相思使我恨悠悠，一塲春夢空回首，都只爲緣慳福淺枉綢繆。……美嬌妻如渡客舟，好兒女又是眼前愁，」便是哭靈中的妙句。至於士大夫之流異口同聲稱道不絕的「客途秋恨」和嘆五更，都是龍舟歌，文字美妙，悲婉凄凉，不厭千百回唱。</p>
<p>唱「木魚」和「龍舟歌」並不如張君所說的沒有節拍和高低的，却偏要自一定的調頭，我們叫作「南音」的，抑揚頓挫，非常悅耳。總之，「木魚」和「龍舟歌」都是以兒女私情爲骨的多，忠君愛國的作品雖有，因爲不合人們的口胃，只好束之高閣。</p>
<p>在廣東有一種賣唱的「盲妹」，唱得好一口「龍舟歌」和「木魚」，代價甚低。</p>
<h3>地球先生的不安</h3>
<p>— 江敉</p>
<h3>古猗園與糞翁起一</h3>
<p>— 叔範</p>
<p>糢糊人影織長廊。兵火　朝漸漸荒。樹亦吁風多感慨。鴉如爲客說滄桑。一壺生氣桃花紫。半尺微陽蘆水黃。去迹來痕都夢耳。匆匆來去爲誰忙。</p>
<h3>夜飲示糞翁起一</h3>
<p>雖無鑠骨唐衢淚。話到求　意已銷。入市黃金都化虎。蠕腸綠螘各爲潮。何年江竹擎君手。幾見　薇贖　腰。窺戶輸他屠販子。兩街鼾答馬蹄驕。</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十六回　簾幕隱啼痕難逃冷眼衣冠誇幸運會到權門</p>
<p>他笑道：程先生，有一件事，頗對不起你。志前笑道：笑話。彼此是新交朋友，並沒有什麼多大往　，這對不起三個字，從何而說起？介夫笑道：這話我不說，我想你也知道。就是……說着，聲音低了一低，　笑道　就是那位朱姑娘，已經讓多才兄藏之金屋了。本來這個　兒是很屬意於閣下的，這倒有點讓閣下割愛了。志前始而是氣向上衝，臉都　紫了。轉一個念頭，可笑了起來，把臉上的紫色平了下去。因道：這話說起來可就遠了。賈先生納寵，本來就不干我事。就算干涉到我身上，也不能要張先生來和我道歉。這件事不是很感到趣味嗎？介夫道：不，我和賈先生至好，我是可以代表　道歉的。　前想了一想，笑道：這是出於賈先生的意思呢？還是出於張先生的意思呢？介夫道：賈先生意思是有的，不過他不便說出來。我剛才由財政廳建設廳兩處回來，和多才在一處談了許久。志　道：那新娘子很快樂吧？介夫道：那是自然。你不看我穿馬褂？我就是爲了見兩位廳長的原故。要不然；加上一件馬褂，究竟也是嫌熱。志前道：那姑娘由窮得要飯，一變而作銀行家的姨太太，當然是快樂的。他說了什麼嗎？說話時，茶房已是替他開了房門。（二六九）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>我本想求伊帮助，却不料反受了伊一套很難堪的奚落，我不由就從害怕化爲憤怒了：便決意不顧一切的直接去向太后問個明白，究竟我將受怎樣的待遇。當時我也不暇思索，立刻便撇下了那女官，走進太后的寢宮中去；且因憤懣過度，連兩頰上也脹得通紅了。太后瞧我一走進去就現着很詫異的容色，因爲伊並不曾差人來召過我：而且依照宮內的規矩，我也絕對不許未經宣召而直入伊的寢宮，現在我竟公然犯了這規矩，伊自然要覺得很詫異了！我也不知道第一句話該怎麼說才好，只把雙膝跪了下去，低着頭，伏在伊的座前。</p>
<p>「德齡，你爲什麼又回來了」？伊就忙着詰問我。</p>
<p>「太后，我是特地來給老佛爺叩頭謝罪的！」我鼓着勇氣，答復了伊；但我的勇氣到底還有限，說了第一句，便禁不住哭起來了。「奴才此刻才知道不該勸阻太后不上那長廊下去散步；據說這樣，我已經是犯了大罪了，說不走就要給你老人家殺頭了，所以我急着來謝罪。求你赦了我這一遭！」</p>
<p>「站起來！」太后方才倒不怒，此刻聽我說出了原委，倒有些　怒了。便連珠價的追問我道：「是那一個告訴你的？是李蓮英嗎？還是那一個女官？」</p>
<p>不是李總管！是××告訴奴才的！」我忍住了哭，答道：「其餘的各位女官，也說伊給我說的是不錯的。」（三六九）</p>
<h3>世界之最</h3>
<p>— 大千</p>
<p>人類有不肯故步自封之心，故世界各項最高紀錄，亦日有所增進而不已，昨日之最，今日已屈居第二，甚至有不能保其第二之位置者，彙集一二，以見世事之演進，轉瞬間此數則或　　明日黃花之　歟？噫嘻！</p>
<p>世界商輪之最　世界商輪航行最快紀錄，已爲世界最大商輪最近下水之法國郵船諾曼迪號造成矣。諾曼迪號長一千零二十九呎，寬一百二十八呎，自龍骨至駕駛室頂高共一百二十八呎，噸位七萬九千二百八十，世界各輪，無有出其右者。構造時共用釘約　千萬個，粗細電綫共長約四千英里，粗細水管汽管等共長約五十英里，僱用廚子一百八十七人，茶役六百二十八人，船面水手一百零八人，其大餐　長達三百呎，尤屬駭人聽聞，最近自英國之肇順浦敦　行處女航來美，於六月三日上午十時半到達紐約港埠，凡歴四天三小時　三分　十八秒，已跨越大西洋而過，平均速度爲每小時二九·六八海里，（較英里稍大約常當我國三·三里）超過以前意大利郵船臘克斯號（噸位五萬四千）自直布羅陀海峽出發所造成每小時二八·九　海里之世界商輪最快紀錄。其間最快之一日共行七四八海里，平均每小時爲三一·一七海里，最大速度曾達　　·　九海里，乃現時世界一切商輪之最快紀錄，而超越我國火車最高速度之限度矣！諾曼迪輪　電力運動推進機，電力則　蒸汽機磨出，蒸汽機之燃料用油，蒸汽之壓力爲每方吋四百磅，溫度爲華氏表六百六十度，此種間接移動力之裝置，可減少機器之喧鬧，發電機凡四個，每個四萬馬力，共十六萬馬力，可抵大西洋中平均十個商輪動力之數，世界船舶之動力，能超過此數者惟美國軍艦中以高速度爲目標之航空母艦薩拉多加及勒克森敦而已！此二艦各爲十八萬馬力，分裝八個發電機，每個　萬二千五百馬力，諾曼迪則分裝四個發電機，故以每個發電機言，尙　上述二艦爲大。若以此電力移在陸地應用，則可供美國波士頓市全市（人口七十八萬七千二百七十一）所需，亦足使人咋舌矣！</p>
<p>世界最大之樹　美國加利福尼亞省之　中多大樹，西卦亞叢林中之大樹尤著。以前談大樹者咸以西卦亞叢林中之大樹雪爾曼大將爲世界第一大樹，地理書中亦往往載有西卦亞之名。最近有加爾金及米爾者，依據四十五年前寇恩河畔居民　勃脫所指出之大樹林，從事探訪並實際攝影測量，積年累月，乃於去　發現較雪爾曼大將史大之樹多株，其最大者底部樹幹周圍凡　百二十四呎六吋，較雪爾曼大將之底圍　百零　呎六吋紀錄尙超出二十餘呎，年齡約在四千年左右，較雪爾曼大將之　千年左右亦多凡　千年，世界樹王，當屬之此新發現者矣。此大樹之樹梢，已爲大風折去，然其高尚有二百呎，其旁之樹，大雖不及之，而高有達三百呎者。此大樹叢林以加爾金等首先從事測量之故，亦即稱之爲加爾金叢林，地點則亦加利福尼省希拉大山脈中之一部云。</p>
<p>世界最大之飛機　俄國多大飛機，載客四五十名者共已有數架，德國乃特造大飛機以壓倒之。最近德國所有之最大飛機，共裝八個推進機，全部重量爲七十噸，（約當我國十萬斤）兩翼拓展凡一百九十呎，能載客七十人，定名爲馬克遜高吉，乃現時世界最大之飛機也。</p>
<p>世界最大之天文鏡　現時世界最大之天文鏡，已在美國，鏡頭直徑凡一百英寸，安置於美國加利福尼亞省巴塞迪那市後威爾遜山頂天文臺中。乃威爾遜山前之加州理工大學，更計劃造　大逾現時最大天文鏡凡四倍之二百英寸直徑大天文鏡，進行已有數年，現已完成一百二十英寸直徑試騐鏡片一個，將來最後鏡片（即二百英寸直徑之鏡片）之厚約爲二十六英寸，重約二十噸，（約合我國三萬斤）目前亦已在紐約澆製完成，正在逐漸冷却中，本年冬可運至加州理工大學加以磨琢，預計三年內可以完成。安置此鏡之地點，已擇定威爾遜山東南約七十英里之巴洛馬山，山高約六千呎，此地點之決定，亦經各專家所組織之選地委員會五年之調查比較並討論云。此鏡完成後將特注意觀察星雲以及離地球較遠各星辰之溫度，密度及其變遷情況等，依此鏡所具之空前聚光力推測，將有不少新宇宙發現，可斷言也。</p>

<h3>節操</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>中國歷史上所謂士君子，以節操爲重，取巧躲避，却並不是儒家之道。東漢末年，黨錮禍起，張儉亡命困迫，無論投向什麼人家，只要知道是張儉，明知要惹大禍，大家甘於破家相容。范滂初繫黃門北寺獄，同囚的很多生病；滂自請先受榜掠三木囊頭暴於階下。滂遇赦歸鄉，又以張儉案株連，朝廷大誅黨人，詔下急捕范滂等。督郵吳導抱詔書閉戶伏床而泣，范滂聽到這消息，知道督郵爲的是他自己，便到縣自首。縣令郭揖解印綬，願與范滂同走，語滂日：「天下這麼大，你怎麼到這見來？」范滂道：「我死了，大禍也就完了，怎麼可以牽連到別人呢？」滂別母就獄。他的母親安慰他道：「和李膺杜密死在一起，豈不是很光榮的嗎？」黨案牽連到李膺，有人勸李膺出走。李膺道：「處事不怕難，有罪不逃刑，乃是臣下的本分。我今年已六十，死生有命，往那兒逃呢？」便就獄受毒刑而死。黨案株連所及，各人的門生故吏及其父兄，都在禁錮之列。蜀郡景毅曾叫他的兒子從李膺爲門徒：因爲未有錄牒，免於禁錮。景毅便自請免官，道：「因爲敬仰李膺的爲人，才着顧兒去從他；難道漏列名籍，便自苟安了嗎？」這種種地方，都可以想見當時士君子重節操，輕性命不肯躱避取巧的情形。</p>
<p>禍患到來的時候，親戚故舊遠嫌避禍的，本來也很多。但就儒家的氣節來說，遠嫌避禍，也是不應該的。孔融性剛直，時常和曹操相衝突。友人脂習每勸融明哲保身。後來孔融被曹操所殺，陳尸許下，沒人敢去收屍。脂習卽往撫尸痛哭，被曹換所拘囚而不顧。又如張儉因黨案逃至魯國，欲投依孔褒。恰巧孔褒不在家，孔融年僅十六，擅自收容下來。後來事泄，褒融二人均被收送獄獄。孔融挺身道：「我作主收容張儉的，請長官辦我的罪！」孔褒道：「張儉是來找我的，和舍弟沒有關係的，請辦我的罪。」吏久不能决，只好探問他們母親的意見。孔母道：「我是家長，我負責任，請辦我的罪！」一門爭死，連郡縣都不能决。我們看了這種捨身赴死的精神，千百年後還振發起來，無怪當時震盪一般人的心靈，大家都要砥礪節操了！</p>
<p>「哀莫大於心死」，假使人人以偷巧躲避爲得計，那末，中國讀書人，都要個個都變成「漢奸了」！「禮義廉恥」之說方興，我願國人注重「恥字」，就該把「節操」比一切都看重些。</p>
<h3>大油條</h3>
<p>— 欽文</p>
<p>侄子產生的那年，弟婦是在敎書的；如果辭去職務自己哺乳，生活費將要不够開支，計算的結果，認爲不如雇奶媽，雖然明知道不大妥當，也就無可奈何的做了。</p>
<p>奶媽做事很勤勞，用錢更節省，兩年中她正式的工資，好像一元大洋也不曾兌散過。從她做了奶媽以後，她丈夫按月寄歸的錢已够應付寄養在鄰居的小孩子，她的工姿如數儲蓄了。侄子斷了乳，因爲信用好，她另行凑借了幾十元；她的男人本是豆腐作出身的，就一道開起來了爿小小的豆腐店。生意倒不錯，領回小孩子，一家重聚，男做女賣，着實有人羨慕；——這已是兩年以前的事了。</p>
<p>不料一年多來，生意漸漸的淸淡了；並非豆腐做了壞，也不是因爲得罪了什麼主顧，只是爲着蘿蔔白菜等太便宜，兩三個銅子可以買到一大堆，連猪肉也一塊錢有六七斤；房租捐稅照樣重，豆腐却不能怎樣减價。除非做素菜，豆腐本來算不得什麼，誰還願意出高價來買這種東西吃呢？爲着維持，奶媽的豆腐店里就帶賣起來了油炸臭一豆腐乾；雖然不無小補，可是豆腐的銷路愈來愈差，仍然入不敷出，於是又帶賣了油條。</p>
<p>侄子已經會走路，可是家境，也愈來愈不像樣，弄得索性吃起包飯來：早餐是粥，照例有一碟油條，是一段一段切得很小的；侄子不滿足，常常嚷着要到奶媽里去吃整個的油條</p>
<p>這一天沒有太陽，也不有下雨；雖然是初夏，陰沈沈的好像是深秋時節；室內悶得很，弟婦就偕着侄子去散步。我知道，他們一經出門，總要到奶媽的豆腐店裏去走一轉，回來時恰巧在門口碰着了。</p>
<p>『吃着了油條麼？』我信口的控間。</p>
<p>『只有兩個大油條！」弟婦慨怒着回對。</p>
<p>『兩個，不是也巳够了麼？』</p>
<p>『那裏眞的是油條，是兩地木板，看去好象是兩個大油條的，交叉的釘在鬥上了，太概因爲虧室得太多，被封了！』</p>
<p>「見不到他們的人，」弟婦興奮着又說，「不知道到什麼地方去了，也許押在法院裏罷」</p>
<p>侄子早已走進房間去，弟婦還是呆呆的站在鬥口，顯得非常感動了。她對於奶媽委實懷着深厚的同情，但這有什麼用處呢。大大家早都明白，虧空一天一天的擴大，總不是個辦法，不過元法阻止蘿蔔白菜等的長期跌價；——農人重重的挑了一滿擔，元非賣得幾十個銅子，辛辛苦苦的種作，所得的報酬只很稀薄的一點點，也是够爲難的了。</p>
<p>其實弟婦自己，何嘗不是可慨的；當了多年市立小學校長的她，兩年以來只是給自己的小孩子做保姆；還做不好，因爲節衣節食得厲害！</p>

<h3>弔一個爲失戀病死的朋友</h3>
<p>— 沈聖時</p>
<p>碎一個皂泡的輕夢，</p>
<p>你偏是那麼認眞。</p>
<p>想不出最好的話，</p>
<p>撫慰你痴情的靈魂。</p>
<p>人世原不像你想的那麼天眞，</p>
<p>純正的愛情早落了難，</p>
<p>唯有黃金攀得住綺麗的夢。</p>
<p>美的全是假做的謊話。</p>
<p>人生原不是走一個圓順的圈，</p>
<p>各個夢想全會中你的意</p>
<p>你戀念的往往偏從眼前漏過，</p>
<p>最惱心的事一生在脚脛上了鎖，</p>
<p>到死也不容易放鬆。</p>
<p>唯有你攀戀的輕夢，</p>
<p>像是泡，風一吹就碎。</p>
<p>現在你摸進了幽黑的世界。</p>
<p>死是人生最大的休息，</p>
<p>墓道上的亂草閑花，</p>
<p>也許還要攀擾你的靈魂。</p>
<p>凄風雨夜，</p>
<p>也許會有一個悔恨，要敲你凝凍的心鬥。</p>

<p>通常我不大留心自己的衣衫，甚或我也並不重視臉上的油垢，以及叢草似的髭鬚。常每一個早晨起來，不等我細細揩去隔宿的垢膩，便已有等着我去幹的事了，由於這種忽忽的梳洗，很容易地餘垢留在臉上。本來我底臉並不是白哲的，所以、一有餘垢未經揩去，臉色也就晦暗無光。假如這時我忽然想到，要知道一點未來的事，而我去訪問一位年老的卜者；那末他所吿訴我的話，一定就是「流年不佳」吧！雖然，像我這樣忙迫於目前生活的人，是沒有一種雅興去訪問卜者的啊！</p>
<p>也許有人會說，「不修邊幅」是文人的癖性，而這句話對於我，都是毫不發生一點兒效用的，因爲我旣非文人，又無做文人的志願，則豈欲學名士而自嗚風雅乎。而我又豈敢！其實，倘若有人說我性慚，那末也許倒有點理由的。爲了生活，我不得不對於修飾之類的事，懶於去作了！一慚以後，便成習慣，不復可改。</p>
<p>彷彿是五月裏的某一天吧，我去訪問一個朋友，這時恰巧在朋友的富所裏，有二位小姐也和我一樣地做了我的朋友的賓客。當我走進了客室裏的時候，我發見這二位小姐，正在對我注視，又有一種欲笑不能的神氣，這可使我窘急了！因爲我平生是很少與異性交際的。但我總以爲這二位小姐，大概是在笑我的一件破爛的長衫，心頭正有點瞧她們不起。可是我的朋友却悄悄的呌我走進他的臥室裏去，吿訴我說，我的臉上有着一塊墨痕。於是，我恍然乎那二位小姐笑我的理由；同時，我也就覺得鏡子的需要了！假使當我在出門的時候，照一照鏡子，那末總可免了見笑於小姐們之前了。</p>
<p>因爲忘記不了小姐們的訕笑，我立志要去買一面鏡子，而鏡子也終於買來了！這面鏡子是很美麗的，除開了晶瑩閃亮的鏡面不說；單就那珠光玉色鵝黃的電玉框子，巳够我爲他而沉思，爲他而擊節贊嘆了！於是，我很虔誠的把他安置於我的書桌上，大約這面鏡子總能帮助我，留心一點自己的靑春的消息了吧！我想。</p>
<p>由於早熟的緣故，使我變成一個憂鬱質的年靑人——不，年靑的老人哪！是的，我覺得以「年靑的老人」這五個字，來當作我的雅蘊，是最適宜不過的。自從我有了一面鏡子以後，是更有了一個明確的證據了。不是嗎？當我每一次對鏡自照的時候，我是常常不想信，鏡中的影子，就是我啊！假若是我，那末我要問，我底靑春呢？我底靑春呢？難道我的靑春會不留下一點痕跡地去了嗎？自然，一個人在發覺自己的靑春，已無聲地萎謝了的時候，這個人的傷感，是應該用怎樣的字句，去形容方才酷肖呢？然而，我如今是只有一顆二十顆的心哪！爲甚麼我的臉如此蒼老呢？爲甚麼我的額上已經有着無可抹去的皺紋呢？遼有，還有我的靑春的活潑的笑，爲甚麼已經換成了一種熟知世故的沉默呢？啊！假使我放縱着自己的感情想下去，我是會變做藝人的呀！生活，生活，生活吞噬了我的靑春，生活塗抹了我的臉上的靑春的光彩，可怕的生活！</p>
<p>爲了避免自己的傷感，我把鏡子丟在屋角裏，讓塵灰蛛絲埋葬了牠吧！</p>
<h3>我愛寂寞</h3>
<p>— 羅洪</p>
<p>爲了給生活磨折得筋疲力盡，爲了給周圍的荊棘刺傷了我的心，我近來更愛寂寞了。到現在，我才明白一顆純潔的心，是如何容易給人損傷，一種前進的勇氣，是如何會被環境所阻擋的。你憑着正大的氣度作事，把公正分給別人，一定有人坦白地說笑你的愚蠢，而且在暗地裏向你搗蛋的。你好意爲別人作一件事或說一句話，結果會換得他人的惡意。甚至你爲自己讀一冊書，也有人會說笑你許多是非。於是一顆純潔的心，慢慢憂鬱起來，給這種汚穢之氣所包圍了。因此，在人羣的旋渦中，我深深地感到了寂寞；這寂寞的意味，把我一顆靑春的活躍的心，埋葬到灰暗的地窖去了。</p>
<p>在我的周圍，沒有希望，沒有歡樂，甚至沒有友愛。我笑的時候，悲哀的鐵掌把我揉壞了；我鼓着勇氣的時候，失望把我擋住了；於是我結果只得到了寂寞。</p>
<p>我愛寂寞，在生活上能夠有一點餘裕的暇閑，一個人寂寞地想到過去，想到將來，那是比找一個朋友說許多不相干的無聊話有趣多的；或者寂寞地獨個見置身在書堆中間，任性地讀去，跟書中的人物一起哭，一起笑，沒有人會左右你，那是比聽着別人的咒駡要强得多了。</p>
<p>我並不是學古今雅士們，故意遠避人羣，獨個見去唱高調。我只是想默默地把痛苦忍受下去，默默地把一顆心放到更有月的地方去。在寂寞中努力起來的勝利並不足誇張的，在寂寞中的失敗也不足使勇氣完全消失的。</p>
<p>有一個朋友寫信來對我說：『你爲什麼這樣沉默呢？你不會向環境抵抗嗎？……』這朋友還寫了許多關心我的話，然而對於她的好意我却不能接受的，我實在要笑我這位朋友太天眞了，她還沒有知道我像她一樣的一顆天眞的心，是怎樣的被損傷了的。</p>
<p>我願我這個不幸的命運，在寂寞中把生活安穩地打發過去。</p>
<h3>大學時代（二六）</h3>
<p>— 德國施托謨書陳隱之譯</p>
<p>他話未曾說完，我已經走到寫字檯邊把一把金幣數在桌上了。『够了麼。克里斯多夫？』</p>
<p>『我謝謝你，菲力。』他小心把金幣裝進他的錢袋裏去，袋中已經有好多金幣和銀幣了。此時我才注意他是穿着黑色的星期日服裝站在我面前。</p>
<p>「你把大禮服都穿起來了，」我問，「剛才到甚麼地方去來？」</p>
<p>「這個……」他說，一面深思地用手擦他的廣闊額頭，「我國到警察局去過啊！」</p>
<p>「你已經得到你的路照了麼？」</p>
<p>「是的，我連退職書都有了。」</p>
<p>我帶點疑問神氣凝視他。</p>
<p>「就是因爲跳舞館那件無聊事情。」</p>
<p>我突然胸中一亮。「原來如此！那麼你就是個人了？」我問他；「你看我竟然沒有想到是你！」</p>
<p>『我當時確是在塲的，菲力。』</p>
<p>『雷娜麗同你一道吧？』</p>
<p>他點點頭。</p>
<p>『你就把「土伯爵」凑了一頓？』</p>
<p>一種服了仇的微笑現出在他的嘴邊。『他們說是我打的，』他回答。</p>
<p>學生界的老對頭說這話時用着滿意的口氣，使得我對這件事情再沒有懷疑餘地了。</p>
<p>我不禁大聲笑起來。『吿訴我吧！那件事情是怎樣經過的？』</p>
<p>『這個……，菲力！你不是已經知道我同　麗一塊去的麼？」</p>
<p>『你們兩個是預先約好一塊去的麼？』</p>
<p>『是這樣一回事。』他回答。『她是一個多藝多才的人，老姨母死後她又可得到一筆小過產。』</p>
<p>我微笑地看着他。『克里斯多夫，』我說『她平素很不錯啊；就是你，你平常也不是這樣容易動手打人的！』他眼睛向前凝視了一會。『我也是莫各其妙，』他說，『我們站在隊伍裏，娜麗和我，——我到那裏去正爲助她的興趣的——那個蒼白面色的高個子走了來，他已經常常向她注視了，此時同另一個人低聲說了幾句話，便不顧排好的次序要來同她特別跳舞。</p>
<p>『那他對你的舞伴不是太混蛋了麼？』</p>

<h3>水災嚴重下的水利建設問題</h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>邇來長江黃河錢塘江及粵省三江，均告水位暴漲，沿江堤圩，沖毀甚多，洪水泛濫，災象已成。雖經各省當局，積極進行救災防水工作，然江河水勢猛漲，險象日增，民二十全國大水災的恐怖，已重現於今日。外患深重的中國，再受此打擊，今後的國計民生，愈不堪設想矣。</p>
<p>夫洪水爲患，自昔已然。我國當局，旣未能作根本治水之大計，而每次受大水威脅，又只能臨變張皇，聊盡人事。此歷來治水之惟一方法也，民二十的大水災曾給我們一個重大的警告。倘國人受此重創，能急圖防範，今日的災害，旣無法避免，亦不至如是之擴大。故今番水災的險惡，未始不是已往治水政策因循了事的結果。</p>
<p>水災本屬天禍，但人力可以勝天，只要預防得宜，克服亦非困難。然我國對於防水工作，是採取一種頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚的辦法。從未從根本上着想，作一勞永逸之計。</p>
<p>然根本治水，又豈是今日我國的經濟力量所能允許？據許多外國水利專家的考察，根本預防長江黃河水患辦法，決不在防堤的增高，而在水利的建設。蓋增高防堤，不但不是以防水溢，一旦水潰，則爲患之烈，更屬危險。但水利建設，必須籌備鉅欵，購辦水利機件，以資進行。當此國困民窮之際，我國實無此能力。近日中央社記者往訪某外籍水利專家，詢以治水辦法。據談本人對於籌欵購機治水辦法，認爲不適宜於現在的中國。但他相信中國的鋤與犁等農具，均可作爲治水的良好機件。設中國各省當局，能督率勤勞的國人，利用其鋤與犁等農具，在河流兩岸，同闢支流。同時水利機關，放棄其增高防堤的工作，而注重於水道的疏　。則旣可避免水患，又可引江水灌漑田禾，實一舉而數得。我們並非水利專家，對於水利建設，自屬一無所知。惟據該水利專家所云，上述意見，自信足供中國水利當局的研究。望國人注意及之。</p>
<h3>妬</h3>
<p>— 拓人</p>
<p>「蘭姑娘眼」一個刺耳的名字撲進所長的耳朶裏，他用着尖銳而憤出着怒火的眼睛向着書記官的臉上一瞟，不移動的釘在書記官的臉上。眼睛突然的注視，這使書記官感到一陣可怕的威脅，但他不能逃避，他只好又依心下氣的說：</p>
<p>「所長，我說，趕快的把蘭姑娘討來吧，省得每天跑來跑去」。</p>
<p>書記官囁嚅的說出這話來，他想這一下可一定把所長的心事說中了吧！然而出於意外，所長還是一聲不響，眼睛還是死釘在書記官的臉上。到了這樣的地步，書記官也感到自己的失敗，沒趣，他也沉默起來。</p>
<p>在十幾分鐘的沉默之後，書記官伸手在寫字臺上摸了一根雪茄，送給躺在沙法上的所長，自己却含着一枝紙烟。於是兩人暫時用抽烟來代替了沉默。終於所長開口說：</p>
<p>「你總不會想到，從昨晚到現在，我始終解決不了一個問題」。</p>
<p>所長說定之後，眼睛又釘到書記官的臉上。專會奉承和誰都知道他是很會想些狡猾陰險的事底書記官，這時以爲是說話的時候了，他於是微笑着說：</p>
<p>「所長，像所長這樣的人還有什麼難以解決的問題？那筆欵子我已經計劃好，一切都不成問題，照我的計算，每月……哼，每月最少得有五六千，而且……」</p>
<p>書記官滔滔不絕的說下去，所長聽得不耐煩了，他截斷了書記官的話頭不再給他說下去的說着：</p>
<p>「不是那麼回事，你知道嗎？那可恨的傢伙，我……</p>
<p>書記官知道說不對路，馬上就改口的問着：</p>
<p>「那個？與所長作對嗎？是不是商會的主席不讚成抽建築費？或者是……啊！眞是可恨。所長：這些都不必慮它吧！」</p>
<p>書記官是每年帮所長專門籌劃一些錢的問題的，所長所有煩難的事，也不過是這些，所以他儘在這些問題上打注意，但所長却自己說出來了。</p>
<p>「媽的，黃士琦這傢伙，我一定要措置他…」他停了一下，吸上一口雪茄又說：「他難道不知蘭妹我是下月就要娶來的嗎？他哼，還想去鬼混，你想，昨天晚上他還去她那裏」。</p>
<p>突如其來的這幾句話把書記官楞住了，這眞是出他意料之外，原來所長是爲着這末一件搜索全個腦袋都不會想到的事情。他沉默了幾分鐘才對着所長說：</p>
<p>「那麼……蘭姑娘怎樣呢？黃士琦那傢伙眞不是好東西」！</p>
<p>「她？她還有怎麼樣，我願意討她，難道她還不願意嗎？不過黃士琦那傢伙是非措置他一下不可」！</p>
<p>書記官聽了所長的回答，卽低着頭沉思的吸着紙烟。本來專門想些狡猾陰險的事的書記官，對這問題也只好沉默一下了，他向着心裏，腦際，腸中，他身上所有的機靈的各部分去搜索。過了有一刻鐘的時間，他很嚴肅地望着所長說：</p>
<p>「措置他最好的法子是把他免職，不過名目要用得堂皇點，那就是「秘狎私娼」，不過，恐怕太便宜了他。</p>
<p>所長聽了書記官用着「秘狎私娼」的罪名加在黃士琦身上，認爲到也不錯，但他又想，這還是措置得太輕點。於是所長那一臉的怒火漸漸地消滅下了，他笑着的對書記官說：</p>
<p>「你眞聰明，這辦法很不錯，馬上就辦，寫一張告示一封免職的信吧」！</p>
<p>書記官得了回答，那狡猾陰險的臉上，浮起了一陣勝利的微笑。</p>
<p>於是所長的辦公室中一切又歸於靜默，只有書記官在寫字臺上寫告示和公函發出來的索久久地聲音在嚮着。（完）</p>
<h3>擺夷風物小誌</h3>
<p>— 淡洱</p>
<p>擺夷人，生在海棠　的邊緣上。算是中國地方，該係中國人；然而，中國人一向的老習慣，還不曾除去，稱他們爲「四夷」的夷，所以叫擺夷。而大部分的人，當然又不知道有這種人的存在。</p>
<p>是在雲南的邊境處，多居叢山綿延的山谷溪旁間。西面接緬甸，南面隣安南。水擺夷，多住水邊，旱擺夷，盡處山上。</p>
<p>臨水的水擺夷，臉色很白凈秀緻，幽閒的，隔絕的，獨生長在秀美的大自然的恬靜清雅的山水悠奏的圖畫裏，人們是特別的飄然自若。臨水的竹林蕭蕭，日夜不息的嚮着出塵的樂曲，在輕鬆的南風中散盪。這兒，濃蔭的大竹林，遍處皆是。擺夷人的屋子，便不像我們高巍笨重的灰土房，而都是用竹蓋造的竹樓，山下，水上，一列列的竹樓，顏色極配自然的山水的容姿，風陣陣掠過山林，碧波，他們的竹樓，竹樓便彷彿也飄飄欲舞，悠然像活生生的一叢竹，一支草似的，令人望之心神會不覺怡然</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>而動，如春水盈盈的心潮，像暢流的碧波，揚長湧盪。</p>
<p>竹樓都分上下兩層，外觀很飄緻可人，上層住着擺夷，雖然簡樸，倒分外素雅自然。他們特別會講究清潔，臨食前後，桌上總必須放盆清潔的凉水，洗手後才得就食，筷子是土產的竹筷子，用過一次便棄掉，每次換新。這很像文明人們的風習；然而竹樓下層，却盡是畜類之窩，養着各種的家畜，畜糞及亂草遍地皆是。樓之上下，截然不同的兩個世界。</p>
<p>自來雲南人都看他們爲野蠻人，不與通婚，往來極少，通漢語及識漢字的當然很難得；可是，中國人畏遠之，漸漸的，他們却多通英語法語等洋話。衣裝也就日漸歐化，比我們稱他們爲夷的雲南人摩登得很多，很多女人，就像上海那些時髦女人那麼洋化。</p>
<p>洋人的傳教者，不只會到交通利便的都市來傳播上帝的福音，就是那偏僻得連我們中國人都不知道的擺夷的居處，也有他們的足跡。</p>
<p>於是，近緬甸的，多近化英人，近安南的，多近法人，一切都用夷而洋，而隔離海棠葉的主人更遠了。</p>
<p>他們最歡喜歌舞，樂器雖簡單，舞踏也多屬於粗線條之類，但其天眞活潑，和熱烈自然，却極能表現出他們那獨特的民族的風性。不過，洋的勢力愈浸愈濃，連歌舞也多歐化了。</p>
<p>山歌，那是擺夷人，很醉人的民間詩歌，當我游蹤過擺夷的竹林間，雖所不識其音，但那特別輕清，眞摯，自然的音調，令人很悅耳。現在正是大都市的炎夏的酷熱時候，追憶到俱是清幽凉，快得透滑的擺夷處所的山和水，使人很自然的沉醉在回憶的夢中去。</p>
<p>旱擺夷，生活形態便沒有水擺夷的清快，他們都住在山上，物產沒像水擺夷的豐富，便養成他們很刻苦的性質，有一種和現社會全然不同的生活精神。他們的民族性，並不像中國人所稱的夷那麼野蠻呢。他們的人口約佔雲南十分之一二，然而，都在「洋化」去了。雖住在海棠葉的邊緣，却已漸漸在變色，而還爲海棠葉的主人所不知道。</p>
<h3>女人</h3>
<p>— 震寰</p>
<p>天暗啦！</p>
<p>蒼茫的暮色帶來了漸漸深濃的灰黯。</p>
<p>從牛角尖那家帶買捲烟的小酒店裏挨出了門刀疤阿林，肚子裏灌滿了熱刺刺的「菉荳燒」。兩條沉滯得提不起力的軟癱的腿，扛了上半截歪歪斜斜的身子，一幌一幌地，拖着不穩定的遲純的步調，街燈，寥落的，一盞跟一盞亮着淡澹的光，黑暗常使他輕觸着低可碰頭的屋檐。</p>
<p>拐個灣，穿過那邊的金家牌樓，就是市梢了。一片僻野的郊外，孤單地，蓋着個枯黃稻草的屋面，那纔是他的家啦！</p>
<p>「開門哪！」裝着嘶嗄的聲音喚：</p>
<p>「嗅！是阿林叔嗎？」從門縫裏攢出來的女人嬌滴滴的清脆聲音：</p>
<p>接着，伊呀——門開啦！跟夜風沖進來的阿林身上含有「菉荳燒」的火辣辣的濃郁氣味。</p>
<p>「喔唷，洋燈火險些給吹熄啦！」女人像輕柔的飛絮似微弱的聲息：</p>
<p>「多……謝你，嫂子」，阿林的舌尖呆滯得有些作怪。他的那雙紅絲佈滿了的醉眼，骨溜骨溜投在女人扭扣鬆散的棉襖上，一種不可避免的卑劣的念頭，像掀起了波浪似打旋在他的混雜的腦海裏。</p>
<p>「這女人挺漂亮啦！」微笑，吝嗇地溜過他的嘴角，半嚮，又好像記憶起什麼似沉默下去了！</p>
<p>（飄起了彷彿隔離一屢微微的淡霞似渺茫的影子，在過慣了閒適生活的流浪在興隆鎭上的某一個年頭兒的石榴花開時，他認識了從×埠避禍而來的大眼順生跟他的年輕老婆，因爲大家都秘密的幹着販私的事業的緣故，兩個子就在菩薩跟前拆上三支細香的磕起響頭來。——當然順生的年輕老婆，跟大哥的稱呼而尊爲嫂子了。可是順生這倒運的傢伙，在事業上走洩了風，被懸衙門裏派來的人，戴上鐐銬的抓了去，縣太爺辦了他一年零八個月的官司。但，這女人呢，終於在阿林那種仗義的態度之下，被接到他的家。鎭上的人都稱贊阿林這傢伙有情有義！）</p>
<p>「啊！阿林叔，這回你又喝得醉醺醺的！」女人手裏的洋燈火照射在阿林那張出神的赤紅的臉膛上。</p>
<p>「呵……又是醉醺醺的，好嫂子，我……阿林想得你眞苦惱啊！」阿林的嘴唇顫抖着，使他全身的皮肉隨着戰慄地起了劇烈的激動！</p>
<p>「算什麼啊！阿林叔，難道你發酒瘋嗎？」女人就一下子慌張着，睜大了驚異的眼。</p>
<p>「好嫂子，我沒有發酒瘋啊！我想跟你耍上一回！」</p>
<p>「哼！你該想想你那大哥！」</p>
<p>「噢！順生嗎？他在監牢裏啊！好……嫂子，你……答應了吧！」阿林的臂膊，迅雷似撲近了女人的胸前。</p>
<p>「耍嚷啦……」女人手裏的洋燈火被摔碎在地上，她的兩條嫩肥的手臂，給阿林緊緊地握住了！這亡失在强暴和鄙夷的權威下的她，慵倦地使她屈服在阿林的氣喘的動態中！</p>
<p>被阿林的手臂摔倒在一堆乾燥的稻柴上的洋燈，這時候粗一條細一條的活躍的金蛇般的火熖，頓時，蔓延了全屋子。</p>
<p>恐怖提醒了阿林的迷惑着的沉醉！他顧慮不到身邊的那具曾經遭受過殘酷的手段所玩弄的肉體，同時他拋棄了死的襲來，冒着濃烟給溜逃了！</p>
<p>可憐的女人，她消失了靈魂似昏迷地半僵着！頃刻被捲進烈火的旋律中，吱吱喳喳的燒成了漆黑的一團！</p>
<p>第二天，鎭上散佈了阿林的死訊，火燒塲上擠滿了人，可是，他們都遺忘了這屍身是順生的年輕老婆啊！</p>

<p>雲烟烟烟雲籠簾房。月濛濛濛月色昏黃。陰霾霾一座瀟湘館。寒凄凄幾扇碧紗窗。呼嘯嘯千箇琅　竹。草青青數枝瘦海棠。病懨懨一位多愁女。冷清清兩個小梅香。只見他，薄囂囂囂薄羅衫薄。黃瘦瘦瘦黃花容黃。眼忪忪忪眼愁添懷。眉蹙蹙蹙眉恨滿腔。靜悄悄靜坐湘妃榻。軟綿綿軟靠象牙床。黯淡淡一盞殘燭淚。冷冰冰半杯煎藥湯。可憐他，氣喘喘。心蕩蕩。嗽聲聲。淚汪汪。血班班濕透了薄羅裳。情切切切情情忐忑。歎連連連歎歎凄凉。可憐奴，生離離離別故土後。孤棲棲棲跡寄他方。路迢迢雲程千里隔。白茫茫總望不到舊家鄉。虛縹縹只怕倒是黃泉近。到不如，請求求早些去赴無常。你看他，神惚惚萬念皆空虛。影單單諸事盡滄桑。只見那，夜沉沉夜多慘淡。聲寂寂聲息愁更長。只聽得，風颯颯颯風風凄凄。雨霏霏霏雨雨猛猛。滴呤呤銅壺漏不盡。打冷冷鐵馬響叮噹。篤嚨嚨風禁簾鈎動。屑瀝瀝雨點打寒窗。叮噹噹鐘聲敲三下。北鼕鼕譙樓打五更。那妃子是，冷颼颼冷風禁不起。夜漫漫夜雨愁斷腸。從此後病汪汪病魔入膏肓。</p>

<h3>Rising Water in Weishan Lake Covers Sandbars; Investigation Reveals Nanyang Lake Water Inflow; No Sight of Yellow River Flood Yet; Construction of Northern Jiangsu Embankment Begins Yesterday in Subei and Tongfeng Simultaneously</h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) A long-distance phone call from Pei County this afternoon reported that water was seen rising in Weishan Lake yesterday, covering sandbars for about half a li. The water was very clear. An investigation revealed that it was Nanyang Lake water gradually flowing into Wei Lake. No major Yellow River flood flow has been seen yet. Pei County has set up guard posts along the lake shore to transmit water information. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Northern Jiangsu Embankment on the southern shore of Weishan Lake in Pei County began construction today. Pei County dispatched 60,000 laborers. All government agencies were fully mobilized, sending out supervisors. The embankment starts from Chengzi Temple in northern Pei County, connecting with the old embankment in Yutai, and extends eastward to Fang Village in northern Tongshan, near the canal sluice gate. Construction in Tongshan and Feng County is proceeding simultaneously. Supervisor Ding Chaowu arrived in Xuzhou from the province this morning and is scheduled to go to Pei County tomorrow morning to inspect the Weishan Lake water situation and Yellow River flood prevention work. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Chief of Staff of the Special Commissioner's Office, Wang Picheng, and representatives from various counties inspected the Xiaoxin Embankment against Xuzhou in Lanfeng today. According to reports, the embankment is built more than ten li northeast of Lanfeng City, close to the southeastern bank of the Yellow River, and is a mix of stone and earth. It is 2,260 meters long and has been under construction since May 24th, with a deadline of August 2nd for completion. The project is very solid and can prevent Yellow River water from flowing eastward. The Yellow River Commission believes that the river's course at that point curves to the southeast, and plans to partially excavate a new channel straight to the northeast to facilitate river flow and reduce siltation. This is currently being planned. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Li Yizhi and Others Head North to Inspect River Breach Situation</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman of the Yellow River Disaster Committee, Li Yizhi, Standing Committee Member of the Water Conservancy Association, Kong Xiangrong, Deputy Director of the Water Conservancy Department, Zheng Zhaojing, accompanied by League of Nations water conservancy engineering expert, Mr. Potter, and water conservancy advisor, Wan Hefo, traveled north on the Tianjin-Oil train on the evening of the 18th. They are going to the Yellow River area to inspect the breach situation and supervise flood prevention and emergency repair work. Zheng Zhaojing will be gone for two weeks and may pass through Hankou on his return trip. They will first go to Jindi and then inspect Linpuji, Jinan, Kaifeng, Zhongmu, and other places along the way. They will discuss prevention and control measures with Commissioners Li and Kong at any time during the trip. At the breach site in Shandong Province, land materials are being transported first for emergency repairs depending on the situation. It should be easier to resolve when it gets dark. According to today's situation, the water levels of both the Yellow River and the Yangtze River are receding, and the situation in Hankou is easing. Secretary-General Qin, who was originally scheduled to depart north on the 18th, has cancelled his trip due to pending association affairs. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Director of the Shandong Construction Department, Zhang Honglie, came to Nanjing to attend the water conservancy conference and requested the central government to allocate funds for disaster relief at the breaches. He returned to Jinan on the evening of the 18th to report back. It is said that after Zhang returns to Shandong, he will replace Chairman Han to take over Jindi. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Kong Xiangrong and Xu Xinwu passed through Xuzhou from Henan to Beijing yesterday and today, respectively. According to them, they visited Linpuji and found five breaches with a total width of 540 meters. The water flow is very rapid and will inevitably flood Wei Lake. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Flood Prevention Measures for the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers; Water Conservancy Association Has Detailed Proposals</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Water Conservancy Committee of the Economic Commission held a regular meeting on the 16th and had detailed proposals for flood prevention measures for the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers. These are currently being finalized. It is understood that the gist of the proposals is that for the Yangtze River, regarding the breach at Mahua Embankment, it has been decided to urge local authorities to find ways to raise and transport materials, and water conservancy agencies will send more engineers and staff. The central government will provide financial assistance to restore the embankment and prevent disasters in a short period of time. As for the emergency repair work in the Hankou area, the conference decided to build solid flood defenses and take appropriate precautions in the near future. Regarding the fundamental management of the Yangtze River, the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Association has proposed: (1) a fundamental flood prevention plan, (2) an embankment construction plan, and (3) a Dongting Lake management plan. The conference discussed these extensively, and because of the large amount of funding required, they were submitted to the Economic Commission for review. Regarding the Yellow River, the water situation has not yet escaped danger, and the future is worrisome. It has been decided to actively carry out protection measures. In addition to allocating special funds and dispatching engineering personnel, Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces are ordered to discuss detailed plans together. In recent years, various parties have recognized the need for unified administrative power in the management of the Yellow River. The committee members discussed this thoroughly and will first consult with local water conservancy agencies and then find ways to unify them. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It is reported that of the 30 cases discussed at the two meetings of the Water Conservancy Association the day before yesterday, 11 cases were announced on the 18th. The remaining 19 cases belonged to requests for additional funding. Because the operating expenses for the 24th year have already been determined in total and distributed separately, additional funds require additional procedures, so replies were sent separately. As for the above 11 cases, they were handed over to the respective water conservancy agencies for handling in accordance with the resolutions. After the tenth case, the fundamental management plan of the Yangtze River, was passed, it was handed over to the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Association to prepare a detailed plan and submit it for review. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Economic Commission decided on the method for closing the breach in Mahua Embankment: 1. The Yangtze River Water Conservancy Association is responsible for supervision and guidance. 2. Director of the Jiangxi Engineering Bureau, Qiu Ju, is responsible for working with the three provinces to undertake the breaching work. The required expenses will be handled by the three provinces according to established practice. 4. The Economic Commission and Hubei Provincial Government will each allocate 50,000 yuan for application first. The Yangtze River Water Conservancy Association and the relevant departments of the three provinces have been ordered to implement it. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Han River Water Continues to Recede Yesterday; Construction of the Second Flood Defense Embankment Halted</h3>
<p>(Hankou) The water level in Hankou today was 50 feet and 5 inches, a decrease of 4 inches from yesterday. The water level outside Zhang Gong Embankment was 53 feet and 5 inches, a decrease of 7 inches from yesterday. Except for the dangerous section at the Jin Kou area, which is still undergoing emergency repairs, work is also being done on other sections and the major embankments of Wuhan, but the danger is becoming less and less than yesterday. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Mayor of Hankou, Wu Guozhen, said that an emergency meeting of government officials and businessmen in the city originally decided to build a second flood defense embankment along the Ping-Han Railway from Qiaokou to Jin Kou, which would require about 400,000 sacks and 5,000 workers and be completed in five days. Currently, there are difficulties with materials and funding, and the Xiang River has been receding for days. This embankment is no longer urgently needed. If Zhang Gong Embankment becomes dangerous again, Danshui Pond will be blasted and the river water will be diverted into the Yangtze River. During the flood season, there should be no flooding in the urban area. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Over the past 24 hours, the inland water has gradually decreased. Although the reduction is very slight, it is enough to strengthen people's hopes that the most dangerous period has passed. This morning, the water level was 50 feet and 5 inches, compared to 50 feet and 9 inches yesterday morning. Flood prevention officials are hoping that the river water will gradually fall. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Nanjing Garrison Reinforces Embankments</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Nanjing Capital Flood Prevention Committee's garrison embankment reinforcement project began on the 18th, with work divided into sections. From Shangxin River to Beihoukou, the embankment is two kilometers long, and the low point is less than one foot from the water surface. Chief of the Training Corps, Gui Yongqing, dispatched 1,200 soldiers from the training corps to reinforce the embankment, raising it by two feet across the board. From Jiangdongmen to Saihongchang, there are many rivers flowing into the Yangtze River, and the embankments are crisscrossed. They are about four kilometers long, with varying heights, some only a foot away from the water. The Gendarmerie Headquarters dispatched 700 soldiers to undertake the construction work. Other sections, such as Dasheguan from Niangniang Temple to Beihoukou to Sanwen River, and the Jiangbian Zhongshan Road intersection to Yanggong Temple, have low points only inches away from the water, and high points no more than two feet. The Public Works Bureau will handle the emergency repair of these three sections. The garrison embankment reinforcement project is expected to be completed within three days. The Police Department sent a team to defend all sections along the river, responsible for embankments along the river. The required soil will be taken from the vicinity of the embankments. The municipal government issued a notice stating that the river water is rising continuously, and the embankments along the river in the city are in a dangerous state and urgently need to be repaired and raised as soon as possible. The government, after consulting with various parties, decided on flood prevention measures and the training corps and the Gendarmerie Headquarters will assign soldiers to implement the work. The government will send personnel to be responsible for guidance and will immediately carry out emergency repair and reinforcement projects. However, the amount of soil required is very large and will be taken from the vicinity of the coast. It is hoped that the villagers in these areas will not obstruct the taking of soil during the progress of this work to avoid delaying important public affairs. If there are any losses, the municipal government will properly compensate them after the completion of the flood prevention work. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The municipal government is concentrating the transportation of flood prevention materials and will need to use some of the city's trucks. The Public Works Bureau has notified the automobile industry to requisition ten vehicles first, starting from the 18th, which will be requisitioned in rotation to participate in the transportation work. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Xiaguan Water Level Report</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 18th, the Yangtze River water level in Xiaguan was even higher during the high tide. The Engineering Bureau recorded 6.814 meters at 7:00 AM, 6.80 meters at 8:00 AM, 6.768 meters at 9:00 AM, 6.860 meters at 10:00 AM, and 6.951 meters at 11:00 AM. From 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM, it rose to 7.042 meters. At 3-4 PM, it retreated to 7.012 meters, an increase of 0.060 meters compared to the previous water level, totaling about two inches. Officials from the Engineering Bureau said that the bureau's records sometimes differ slightly from those published by the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Association, which is due to slight differences in the recording time and wave surges, which made it impossible to be completely consistent. However, the standards for observing the water level itself are the same. The embankment of the Yangtujiadi Embankment in Xiaguan collapsed the day before yesterday, causing severe turbulence. Cracks appeared in the embankment, with slight subsidence, only about thirty meters. The Public Works Bureau immediately sent Engineer Ke and other technicians to recruit more than 200 workers to supervise emergency repairs, working around the clock. On the 18th, the construction continued, and the situation has eased. As for the section of the Second Marmal Road in Xiaguan, the streets were flooded by about an inch due to water immersion in the ditches, which has also been prevented. This was caused by tidal water overflowing, and everything will return to normal when the water recedes. According to past practice, the tide is largest today, and it will be more stable in two days. In the current situation, Nanjing City can be guaranteed to be safe. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Flood Disaster; Relief Association Established</h3>
<p>(Zhenjiang) The Jiangsu Flood Disaster Relief Association was established on the 18th and held its first meeting, passing 12 articles of regulations.

After the meeting, a standing committee meeting was held, and Yu Jingtang was elected as Director of General Affairs, Shen Baixian as Director of Flood Prevention, Wang Yiting as Director of Fundraising, and Cheng Jingsheng as Director of Disaster Relief. The General Affairs and Flood Prevention groups were established first, and it was resolved to ask the provincial government to quickly order all flood prevention areas to repair the embankments as soon as possible.

<h3>The Story of Ou Guocai Escaping from the Bandit Den</h3>
<p>(Peiping) Ou Guocai, chief of the Machinery Section of the Tangshan-Luan County section of the Beining Railway, was kidnapped by bandits on the 15th of this month. Yin Tong, director of the railway bureau, ordered a strict search, but there were no clues. Unexpectedly, Ou suddenly escaped from the bandit house and returned on the morning of the 17th. He immediately went to the Public Security Bureau to report the incident. In the afternoon of the 17th, Ou moved his family to Tianjin to live temporarily. According to Ou, he had not suffered in the bandit den for several days.

<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>Telegram from Baoding (titles omitted): This month, I have repeatedly received telegrams from the Magistrate of Changyuan County stating that the Yellow River's water level is rising sharply, creating a critical situation. While I was ordering them to do everything possible to reinforce the dikes, subsequent reports indicated that the river overflowed on Jia day (the 9th), inundating more than 300 villages in three provinces, affecting over 100,000 people. Their homes, fields, and graves were all engulfed by the flood. Crops and livestock perished together in the terrifying waves. Those drowning desperately hoped for rescue, and those starving awaited food. The disaster is truly tragic and extremely urgent. Moreover, for the past three years, reports of disasters have been unceasing, leaving few survivors with little vitality. Last year, the Guantai breach was closed with the combined efforts of the Central Government and Hebei Province, giving hope for recovery. Now, the people have suffered another catastrophe, and the pain is even deeper. I, Zhen, have just taken office and, upon hearing of the tragedy, am distraught at midnight. I have already allocated funds from the province's available resources and sent personnel to investigate and distribute aid, and have ordered them to work with local officials and gentry to seek relief. However, the disaster is too great, and the provincial treasury is empty. Alone, it is difficult to bear. I earnestly implore you to have pity on these survivors and compassion for their suffering, and quickly devise methods for relief. Zhen and the 100,000 disaster victims deeply pray and look forward with urgency. Shang Zhen, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, bows (17th).</p>

<h3>Can the United States and Great Britain Cooperate?</h3>
<p>— A Discussion</p>
<p>The clamor for cooperation between the United States and Great Britain has been going on for a long time. The intermittent news and the intricate problems have made it difficult for those who pay attention to current affairs to grasp the situation. Recently, the Far East issue has suddenly become tense, and the international peace movement has gradually gained attention from academic and public opinion circles in various countries. As a result, the theory of US-British cooperation has once again become rife. According to National News Agency reports, Washington publicly declared on the 14th of this month that "the United States and Great Britain are about to implement close cooperation to maintain world peace, and the substance of this cooperation will be more powerful than at any time in recent years," and so on.</p>
<p>Cooperation between the United States and Great Britain is certainly welcome. The success of US-British cooperation would also be enough to reverse the current international situation. However, after reviewing historical facts, I feel that the opposition between the United States and Great Britain has already become a fundamental opposition in present-day capitalism. At a time when the clamor for narrow nationalism is rising to the clouds, whether the United States and Great Britain can sincerely cooperate to maintain international peace is doubtful. Let's discuss it further.</p>
<p>First, in terms of economics, since the failure of the World Economic Conference, the contradictions between the United States and Great Britain have already embarked on an irreconcilable path. The war debt issue has not been resolved for a long time, and the struggle for currency devaluation has arisen again. In addition, raising tariff barriers and closing commodity and raw material markets have only worsened the trade competition between the two countries. Currently, the United States and Great Britain are in direct or indirect conflict in the markets of China, Australia, India, Canada, and Latin American countries, both in terms of trade and investment. The intensification of this kind of market competition is intensifying the currency war and deepening the contradictions between the two countries.</p>
<p>Second, in terms of politics, the deterioration of the economic opposition between the two countries will inevitably form a basis for political disagreement. The open and secret political struggles between the United States and Great Britain are almost constant. They have failed to reach a consensus on the Far East issue and are engaging in schemes to manipulate Latin America and Canada politically. Although the United States ostensibly adheres to the principle of non-interference on European issues, in reality, it still intends to wait for an opportunity to act, which forces Great Britain to be wary.</p>
<p>Third, in terms of military preparedness, Great Britain's claim is to maintain its traditional maritime hegemony, while the United States' position is to complete its most advantageous naval plan. Last year, during the preparatory meeting for the London Naval Conference, Great Britain's total tonnage principle and the United States' big ship and big gun policy almost came to blows, which ultimately led to the indefinite postponement of the Naval Conference and the open fact of naval arms race among the nations.</p>
<p>The above points are all major ones. From this, it can be seen that the road to US-British cooperation is full of hidden reefs. There can be no fundamental success unless both countries abandon their self-centered positions.</p>
<p>However, although fundamental cooperation between the United States and Great Britain is impossible to realize, partial cooperation may not be seen as a matter of fact. From our observation, there are two possibilities for US-British partial cooperation. One is the growing crisis of East Asian monopoly, and the other is the increasing "global dumping" of Japanese goods, which poses a serious threat to the inherent markets of the United States and Great Britain. This kind of economic conflict with Japan has now become increasingly fierce, so the United States and Great Britain will eventually take a consistent step on a common ground.</p>

<h3>Abyssinian Issue: Italian Attitude Softens; No Longer Opposes League of Nations Intervention; British and French Steps Tend Toward Consensus; Current Problem Centers on Right of Way</h3>
<p>(Paris) In the next few days, the atmosphere surrounding the Italo-Ethiopian dispute is expected to improve significantly. Reuters has learned that this change will come from Italy's softening of its opposition to League of Nations intervention. The French government seems to have taken a firm approach, supporting mediation by Geneva, as requested by British Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval. Diplomatic sources in Rome say that all signs are quite favorable. (17th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol today telegraphed member states of the Executive Council, preparing to attend a special meeting from July 25 to August 2 to consider the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. The telegram explicitly stated that the League of Nations will consider intervening in this matter. (17th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The talk that the League of Nations will convene a meeting on July 25 to discuss the Italo-Ethiopian dispute is gaining momentum. League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol met with Prime Minister Laval this afternoon. Well-informed sources claim that the two discussed the Italo-Ethiopian issue and the League of Nations Executive Council's convening of a meeting on July 25. It is increasingly believed here that the best way to resolve the dispute is to allow the League of Nations to implement its resolution passed in May, even if it provokes the indignation of various countries over Italy's policies, and causes other consequences. (17th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) It is reported that the Ethiopian Emperor is willing to cede part of the Wogadan province to Italy. The Italian authorities have sternly refused to consider this proposal, claiming that Wogadan province is a desert and completely unsuitable for colonization. Well-informed sources now say that the railway connecting Eritrea and Italian Somaliland will be dangerous and useless unless it is occupied by troops. British Ambassador to Rome Sir Drummond has met with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini again today. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Since the Emperor of Abyssinia requested the United States to intervene in the Italo-Ethiopian dispute based on the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the United States politely declined, the United States and Great Britain are discussing the Abyssinian issue through diplomatic channels. It is generally believed that although the United States admits that it has no obligation to intervene, its main goal is to assist Great Britain's mediation efforts so that the Italo-Ethiopian dispute can be resolved. Well-informed sources believe that the US government may send observers to Geneva. (17th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ethiopian Emperor Declares: Hopes League of Nations Handles; Will Not Make Diplomatic Contacts Beforehand</h3>
<p>(London) The Emperor of Abyssinia gave an interview to a reporter from the Times yesterday, explaining the country's views on the current state of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. He said, "Ethiopia hopes that the League of Nations Executive Council can discuss this dispute on July 25. Before the Executive Council makes a decision, no diplomatic activities will be undertaken. If the Italo-Ethiopian Mixed Arbitration Committee can reconvene before July 25, Ethiopia will naturally await the results and intends to propose a new procedure. If Great Britain directly makes any suggestions to Ethiopia, Ethiopia is willing to respond. Regarding the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, Ethiopia truly regards the treaty signed by Great Britain, France, and Italy in 1906 as a tool for maintaining peace. However, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's continued troop deployments and arms shipments, and the talk that he himself may come to East Africa, make it impossible to implement the revised treaty of 1906, even if one wishes to. Moreover, is only Great Britain supporting this treaty? As for the manner of conducting negotiations, no suggestions have been made by any party. Ethiopia truly approves of the attitudes of British Foreign Secretary Hoare and Minister without Portfolio Eden. Ethiopia does not object to Great Britain's desire to maintain freedom of action in order to contribute to the establishment of peace. As for the construction of a railway through Ethiopia from Italian Eritrea to Italian Somaliland, the Italian government has not made this proposal, nor has any other government made this claim. The Ethiopian government is still willing to discuss this issue." Regarding the issue of ceding territory, the Ethiopian Emperor's attitude is very clear, believing that exchanging territory is acceptable, but Ethiopia will never recognize ceding territory alone, saying, "If Great Britain is still willing to give the port of Zeila to Ethiopia, then Ethiopia will cede equal land to Italy, but the location of this territory has not been decided. In short, the territory on the northern border of Ethiopia will never be ceded." According to reports, when the Ethiopian Emperor last toured Europe, he expressed the necessity for the country to obtain a port on the Red Sea. Now, he said that this issue is of particular importance to Ethiopia. The Emperor finally said, "Italy's threat to peace is already obvious. If the country declares war on Ethiopia and sends its troops into Ethiopian territory, the Ethiopian government will immediately fight back on the one hand and appeal to the League of Nations on the other." (18th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Cairo: Local Arabic newspapers published excerpts from the Ethiopian Emperor's statements, saying that if Egypt allows Italian military aircraft to cross Egyptian territory, he will consider this an unfriendly act, as it facilitates Italy's activities in invading Ethiopia. Ethiopia still hopes to resolve this dispute peacefully, but is also prepared to exert all its strength to maintain its national independence. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to Madame de Thubali, the diplomatic correspondent for L'Oeuvre, League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol's proposal for the British and French governments to hold a tripartite meeting with Italy to discuss the Italo-Ethiopian issue has failed. Thubali also said that this proposal could have been accepted by France, but because of the attitudes of Great Britain and Italy, it ultimately became a pie in the sky. The British government still requires the dispute to be submitted to the League of Nations for resolution. Therefore, the League of Nations Executive Council's convening of a meeting on July 25 is unavoidable. The French ambassador to Italy's inquiry into the true intentions of the Italian side was also ineffective. Prime Minister Mussolini only said that he wanted to safeguard Italy's dignity and had no other choice but to attack Ethiopia, refusing to make any further statements. Mussolini is unwilling to continue negotiations, but may eventually accept a reconciliation. In order for Italy to utilize the League of Nations, Thubali advocates that Italy should submit evidence to the League of Nations to prove that its accusations against Ethiopia, such as violating treaties and engaging in the slave trade, are indeed facts. (18th National Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Mussolini Indicates Will Use Force From Beginning to End; Rome Releases New Account of Events</h3>
<p>Milan: Prime Minister Mussolini wrote an article today in Il Popolo d'Italia, the newspaper he founded, saying that the Italo-Ethiopian dispute "began with force and must end with force." (17th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) On May 31, a group of Ethiopian natives attacked the Italian army defense line in Tangari, on the border of Italian Eritrea, leading to a new dispute. The official statement of the details of this case is as follows: on the night of that day, Ethiopians belonging to the "Damo Sita" and "Ale Da" tribes, and from the highlands, crossed the border and suddenly invaded the "Matra" plain in Italian Eritrea, and attacked the local Italian tribes. Upon hearing the news, the Italian army immediately rushed to the scene and repelled the Ethiopians. In this battle, many herders, women, and children were killed by the Ethiopian natives, and 4,000 heads of livestock and some people were looted and taken away as slaves. When the Italian army stationed in Sabog Port received the report, it sent a team to the scene of the incident, but the Ethiopian natives had already fled far across the border.

<h3>British Military Preparations to Protect African Territories; But No Need to Increase Military Strength</h3>
<p>(London) Colonial Secretary Malcolm MacDonald told the House of Commons today that if Italy and Ethiopia go to war, Great Britain is prepared to protect the borders of its African territories. He said that the troop movements in the Ganze area were to prevent accidents, but there was no need to increase military strength in the territories. (17th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The House of Lords convened a meeting to discuss the Abyssinian slavery system based on the League of Nations reports. Lord Cecil, Lord Buxton, and Archbishop of Canterbury spoke successively, explaining the slow progress of Abyssinia in abolishing the slavery system, expressing praise for the efforts made by the Ethiopian Emperor. Lord Buxton explained that the existence of slavery in Abyssinia "cannot be used as a pretext for invading Abyssinia." (17th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Sanctions Issue; Committee Prepares Report</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Executive Council's small committee on economic sanctions has completed its discussion and drafted a report, which can be submitted to the Committee of Thirteen. The purpose of the committee is to increase the effectiveness of the collective security system. The committee will meet on July 24 to discuss the recommendations in the report. The report analyzes prevention plans and the implementation of sanctions very clearly, recognizing that prohibiting the trafficking and manufacturing of raw materials used for armaments is a prevention plan, while actual sanctions may completely sever trade relations with the violating country. However, this universal ban should not be applied to goods necessary for human nutrition. The report also states that some countries may not participate in these sanctions, so it is necessary to find ways to prevent these neutral countries from supplying the violating country with arms and raw materials. The small committee itself has some doubts about whether its recommendations can be effective. The report concludes that the various recommendations put forward may cause all sorts of problems, but this is enough to prove the difficulty of the small committee's work.

<h3>Royal Yacht Guides Fleet in Simulated Naval Battle; Merchant Fleet Participates in Exercise for the First Time</h3>
<p>(London) Today, the King, aboard his royal yacht, guided the fleet in a simulated naval battle. One of the unique aspects of this exercise was the use of specially designed shells by the cruisers to bombard radio-controlled target ships. These shells shattered upon impact. Following this, four of the largest battleships, with twenty large cannons of [unclear, illegible character] feet, bombarded a target ship traveling at twenty nautical miles per hour. Additionally, several aircraft, controlled by radio, launched fierce bombardments against the warships, which retaliated with [unclear, illegible character] anti-aircraft fire. Several torpedo boats [unclear, illegible character] bombarded the cruiser "Nelson," but were repelled by cannon and machine gun fire. After the exercise, the entire fleet sailed past the royal yacht, on which the King was [unclear, illegible character].

In addition, a simulated bombardment of a cruiser was demonstrated. [unclear, illegible character] The method involved using the cruiser "Vindictive," also controlled via radio, as a target for the ships to fire at. A total of 220 shots were fired, of which 56 hit the hull of the "Vindictive." (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>France Vigorously Implements Austerity Measures; Opinions Vary Among Factions; Large Problems for Civil Servants; Laval Delivers Radio Address</h3>
<p>(Paris) Following the government's announcement of austerity orders to save substantial funds and balance the budget, a sense of optimism has returned to the country. The stock exchange, most sensitive to public sentiment, has shown a positive reaction. Government bonds have soared in price, as the nation's financial position is expected to improve. However, shares in electricity, mining, munitions, and real estate companies have all fallen, as they are directly affected. It is reported that veterans have agreed to accept reduced pensions. However, the attitude of both veterans and civil servants will be revealed at a meeting scheduled for July 19th. Today, Laval delivered a radio address, urging the entire nation to cooperate in defending the stability of the franc, so that he can focus on dealing with diplomacy and handling peace affairs. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the government issued legal orders to balance the budget and reduce government spending, the trade unions of various public utilities decided to notify their members to hold demonstrations in Paris and the provinces to show their opposition. The various unions here have decided that, regardless of the circumstances, they will convene a large demonstration at the square in front of the National Theatre from 6:30 PM to 8:00 PM on Friday to protest the government's measures to reduce salaries. The Railway Workers' Union, the Postal Workers' Union, and the Unified General Confederation of Labour have joined forces. They believe that the government's mandated salary cuts for civil servants will have a far greater [unclear, illegible character] impact on middle and lower-level personnel than on senior personnel. As for the measures to reduce the cost of living stipulated in the order, they are, in practice, almost entirely superficial. Even if the cost of living is reduced, the proportion will certainly not match the proportion of salary reductions. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Twenty-four hours have passed since Laval's twenty-eight emergency decrees were issued. Criticism from the general public and commentary from newspapers is gradually increasing. Initially, the general opinion was that the government's measures were courageous, decisive, and admirable. Later, there was a feeling that the government's cuts to civil servants' salaries and other benefits had exceeded public expectations. Moreover, there was a major question as to whether living expenses could be reduced at the same time after the income of these people was reduced. The Socialist Party and its Communist Party newspapers unanimously attacked these decrees, advocating that all officials and civil servants rise up in [unclear, illegible character] opposition. The Railway Workers' Union and the Civil Servants' Union are now united in their opposition and have scheduled a meeting in front of a theater tomorrow to discuss how to respond, disregarding the government's ban on all outdoor gatherings. The National Assembly is also deeply dissatisfied. The Echo de Paris commented that these measures are overly sacrificial and feared that every French person would be affected. Furthermore, if the government's attempt to revive the economy fails again, it will plunge France into bankruptcy. Le Journal stated that these decrees are a decisive action by the government to restore its economic position. Le Petit Parisien stated that Laval will certainly use his extraordinary skills, wisdom, and confidence to promote the implementation of these decrees, and July 16th can be regarded as a major turning point for France to maintain its currency and revive the economy. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The cabinet meeting last night resolved to ban all demonstrations and marches so that the government could calmly implement its plans to protect the franc and implement austerity measures. The Ministry of the Interior warned the heads of all police stations to strictly comply with this order, which also prohibits gatherings of veterans and civil servants. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval delivered a radio address at 8:00 PM this evening, explaining the significance and scope of the government's distribution of substitute legal orders, stating that the main purpose of these measures is to maintain the value of the franc. He said, "Recently, regarding monetary policy, some people advocate devaluation, while others advocate inflating the currency. Those who advocate devaluation forget that the franc has already been devalued by four-fifths compared to the pre-war gold franc, while those who advocate currency inflation cannot avoid causing chaos in the monetary system. We cannot condone all of this and are willing to take a different path. The people celebrated the Republic Day and our free system last Sunday in a cheerful and solemn atmosphere. We must know that the Republic and freedom are difficult to preserve if the nation's finances cannot be independent, because there is no free country without sound finances." Laval also said that France's total national debt was 260,000,000,000 francs five years ago, but has now increased to 340,000,000,000 francs. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister Laval made a five-minute radio broadcast address today, vehemently defending the emergency decrees issued yesterday to balance the budget and maintain the currency. Laval believed that France today only has two paths to take: one is a government with courage and action, and the other is revolution. The steps taken by the government today belong to the former. The government's actions are necessary to maintain the soundness of the French currency. The treasury must have a surplus to balance the budget, and if the budget cannot be balanced, political unrest will cause France to lose its prestige on the international stage. Although Laval's words were like this, the general public is extremely dissatisfied with the government's economic decrees. Former Minister of Subsidies, Rifflard, asked veterans to rise up in opposition, and the trade unions have also protested against the reduction of civil servants' salaries. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The emergency substitute legal order issued yesterday affects income from all aspects, so it is not welcomed, but it has not caused excessive resentment. The people of the whole country are dealing with it calmly. This order is actually gradually being recognized as necessary to reform the national finances and revive the industry. The reaction of the Paris Chamber of Commerce is quite good. Prime Minister Laval made a radio address to the nation tonight, saying that he would fully implement the austerity plan, and at the same time, he would take strong steps to restore industries. The French government must choose between devaluing the franc and protecting the franc. The people of the whole country will inevitably feel the same sacrifices, but after the economic situation improves, this sacrifice can be automatically reduced. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<h3>Archduke Otto: Another Saying About Going to Austria</h3>
<p>Brussels: It was learned here today that Archduke Otto of Habsburg, the successor to the Habsburg imperial family, is now planning to return to Austria to assume the position of regent without immediately taking the throne, and his mother, Empress Zita, will hold the title of regent. According to this plan, it was learned from a letter from Archduke Otto to the mayor of Langenlois, Austria, in which the Archduke thanked the mayor for inviting him to be an honorary citizen. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Archduke Otto of Austria recently wrote to the mayor of Langenlois, roughly saying that he would come to Austria in the near future to take on the position of regent. However, this letter has been banned from publication by the government authorities today. According to speculation here, the possibility of Archduke Otto taking on the position of [unclear, illegible character] regent is very small. First, after this matter is realized, international disputes will immediately become more serious. Second, Prince Starhemberg is now seeking to monopolize power and may not be able to easily allow Otto to obtain this title. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>

<p>Vienna: According to unverified private news from the Bulgarian capital, the Bulgarian government has arrested former Prime Minister Georgiev to prevent a rumored coup against King Boris. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<h3>Third International to Hold Congress</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Seventh Congress of the Communist International (i.e., the Third International) is about to open, and representatives from 59 countries will attend, with a total number of more than 400 people. Most of the representatives have already arrived here, but the locations where the prominent representatives are staying are kept secret, as the representatives are trying to avoid contact with people outside the Communist Party. Dimitrov, a Bulgarian Communist Party member who was detained on suspicion of arson in the German Reichstag fire case and released in February last year, will also attend this congress. It is generally believed that Dimitrov will be the most important figure in the Seventh Congress. He was originally from Bulgaria, but after coming to Russia, he acquired Soviet citizenship. His position in the Third International is becoming increasingly solid. Many members of the Communist Party believe that he is a promising figure in the future. Therefore, in this congress, he is likely to be elected chairman of the Third International after [Grigory] Zinoviev. (Note: Zinoviev was expelled from the Soviet Russian Communist Party in 1925 and removed from the position of chairman of the Third International.) Also, the Seventh Congress is expected to last for several weeks. The reports submitted by the representatives of the Communist Parties of various countries will be discussed separately.

<h3>New French Cruiser Launched</h3>
<p>Saint-Nazaire, France: The new cruiser "La Marseillaise" was launched here today. Navy Minister Pietri delivered a speech, saying that the government has decided to build six light cruisers for reconnaissance purposes. "La Marseillaise" is the second of these six ships. He also said that in the past 14 years, the total tonnage of ships built by public and private shipyards has reached 400,000 tons. The characteristic is that the ships built all belong to the same structural system and are no different. In addition, Pietri also said that France's current submarine fleet is the most powerful submarine fleet in the world, whether measured by total tonnage or by the tonnage of each ship.

<h3>British and American Political and Business Circles Pay Attention to Developing the Market [unclear, illegible character] in Our Country; Manchester Chamber of Commerce Representatives Meet at the British Department of Commerce; Optimistic Expressions from the American Far East Economic Survey Mission</h3>
<p>(London) A delegation from the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, representing the textile, chemical, and machinery industries, met with senior officials from the Department of Commerce today. Sir Ross, the Director of the British Economic Advisory Mission to China, also attended the meeting, which lasted for an hour and fifteen minutes. After the meeting, an official statement was issued, roughly stating that the Chamber of Commerce representatives detailed the difficulties currently encountered by Lancashire in its trade with China and presented their opinions.

<p>(Washington) Forbes, the leader of the American Far East Economic Survey Mission, today presented the potential of Sino-American commercial and economic relations to the National Foreign Trade Council, using optimistic language, saying that China has great opportunities for American investment, such as transportation, public utilities, mining, and general industries, all of which can be places for American investment. China is now mature and can be industrialized. However, the American silver policy has an adverse impact on businesses in China. China has extremely high hopes for expanding trade, almost unmatched by any other country in the world. Chinese Ambassador Shi Zhaoji, Japanese Ambassador Saito, and Far East Director of the State Department, Hanbeck, also gave speeches in succession. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate Agriculture Committee today reviewed McCollum's proposal to cancel 50% of the silver trade duty. It was quite supportive of this proposal. The case was sent to the Agriculture Committee instead of the Banking Committee because it was certain that the Agriculture Committee would immediately review it and support it. The same plan was sent to the Banking Committee several weeks ago, but the committee has not taken any action so far. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(San Francisco) Democratic Senator Pittman is now proposing to merge the Four Silver Mining Companies of the Virginia, Walker, Anthers, and Mexico.

<h3>Puppet State Requests Establishment of Representative Offices from Outer Mongolia</h3>
<p>Manzhouli: The representative of the "Manchukuo" Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Kamachi, presented the following matters to the Outer Mongolian representative on the 17th:</p>
<p>(1) The "Manchukuo Government" requests the establishment of a Manchukuo government representative office in the Republic of Outer Mongolia to avoid various disputes in the future.</p>

<p>(4) Please convey this proposal to the government in Urga. (Nichi-Ren Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Soviet Russian Consul General here protested to the "Manchukuo" Ministry of Foreign Affairs today because the Harbin Times published an article on Tuesday stating that the "Manchukuo" government had decided to close four Russian consulates in "Manchukuo" to retaliate against the Soviet Union's refusal to allow the "Manchukuo" government to establish consulates in Hailar and Blagoveshchensk.

<h3>Continued Clashes in Northern Ireland; Six Deaths</h3>
<p>Belfast, Northern Ireland: The clashes between the Irish Nationalist Party and the Orange Order on the occasion of the Irish National Day last Friday have not yet subsided. For the sake of maintaining order, the police have specially invited the local garrison to jointly guard against it. Today, when some people held a public funeral for the martyrs who died in the street fighting last week, someone from the opposition secretly placed a machine gun in a hidden place and shot at the mourners, which again caused a conflict between the two sides. The police immediately came out with tanks, gun cars, and machine guns to suppress it, and it finally calmed down. At the same time, disturbances continued in various places, and arson occurred everywhere, causing the firefighters to be exhausted. As of now, there have been six deaths. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<h3>US Neutrality Bill</h3>
<p>(Washington) There are three draft laws on the issue of neutrality. The first advocates prohibiting the transportation of arms to belligerent countries, and abolishing protection for domestic ships carrying goods to belligerent countries. The second advocates refusing to issue secret photos to US citizens traveling to belligerent countries. The third advocates prohibiting loans to belligerent countries. When the Senate Foreign Relations Committee discussed this issue today, Republican Senators Vandenberg and La Follette made passionate arguments, saying that Congress should promptly vote to abolish the protection of ships carrying goods to belligerent countries. The committee decided to form a subcommittee and order it to consult with experts from the State Department to agree on a satisfactory method so that the United States could maintain its neutrality in wartime. According to Secretary of State Hull, he had requested the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to postpone submitting to the Senate the two bills prohibiting loans to belligerent countries and refusing to issue passports to US citizens traveling to belligerent countries. At the committee meeting today, Republican Senator Nye, Democratic Senator Clark, and La Follette put forward arguments, saying that if the subcommittee cannot find a compromise solution, this issue should be directly submitted to the Senate for discussion by them. There are currently three trends regarding this issue in various aspects of the United States, and where to go is still undecided, namely: (1) The Senate favors the United States maintaining a neutral position, regardless of right or wrong; (2) The State Department wants to retain the right to determine which is the aggressor so that it can be blocked off alone; (3) The White House does not want Congress to pass any laws so that it can be used freely. The Foreign Affairs Committees of both houses of Congress are currently discussing the control bill for the manufacture and sale of arms. President Roosevelt hopes that after this bill is passed, it will satisfy all those who advocate neutrality and leave the Neutrality Bill to be discussed at the next session of Congress. This seems to be the continued effort of the senators so that they can achieve something. (Havas, 17th)</p>

<h3>Wuhan New Flood Control Plan: Two Lines of Defense Constructed in Case of Emergency, Ye Peng Resigns, Chamber of Commerce Cables Requesting Retention, Liu Shoupeng Fully Responsible for Flood Control in the Provincial Capital</h3>
<p>Hankou Communication: Since the day before yesterday, the river water has been receding. For the past two days, it has continued to recede by two inches. Today's water mark is 50 feet and one inch, and the situation is relatively relieved. However, the dikes are still not safe. Wuhan has formulated new flood control plans, and the responsible personnel have also changed. Initially, the entire Zhang Gong Dike in Hankou was in danger, and various sections presented dangerous signs from time to time. The Jianghan Engineering Bureau could not supply the necessary materials and was unable to carry out repairs on the spot, resulting in continued seepage and then collapse. The Gousao Tree section in the middle collapsed 30 to 40 yards in two days, and there was a risk of breach. Fortunately, all sectors of the Party, government, military, and police were fully mobilized, supervising and forcing more than 20,000 conscripted laborers to rescue desperately, averting the danger. Ye Peng, the director of flood control, and Wu Guozhen, the mayor who assisted in flood control, and Chen Xizeng, the director of public security, stayed on the dike, forgetting to eat and sleep for three days, and the tense atmosphere was evident. Today, the Gousao Tree dam construction project was completed. Ye resigned from his position as director due to illness. He Chengjun and Zhang Qun personally went to the Zhang Dike to persuade him to stay. Ye said that his hemorrhoids were very serious and that all the dangerous works had been repaired. He still handed over the flood control affairs of the dike to the Jianghan Engineering Bureau for full management. Wu Guozhen and Chen Xizeng also left the dike one after another, because yesterday's official and commercial meeting decided on a new flood control plan to raise the Pinghan Railway dike surface from Qiaokou to Nieko as the second line of defense. Wu and Chen both had to preside over this, so they really had no time to take care of the Zhang Dike. Today, the reporter visited Wu at Gousao Tree. According to him, the second line of defense was originally scheduled to start construction today, and 3,000 workers have been recruited, and 300,000 sandbags have also been ordered. Because other materials are not ready, the construction will be changed to tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. That evening, dangerous signs occurred again above and below Jingkou on the Zhang Dike. The Hankou Chamber of Commerce and the Hubei Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation held an emergency meeting to decide to cable Chairman Jiang, Director Zhang Xueliang, Chairman Zhang Qun, and Director He Chengjun to retain Ye Peng to continue to be responsible. The original telegram roughly stated, "This flood is rampant, continuing to rise, the Jianghan River is turbulent and the situation is dangerous, and the Zhang Gong Dike, which is relied upon as a guarantee for Hankou, is difficult to defend against, with continuous seepage and day and night repairs, with problems all around. It is feared that the situation from twenty years ago will be repeated. Since Commander Ye Peng was appointed as the director of flood control, he has rectified the work, unified the command, and worked on the dike for several consecutive days, not shirking his responsibility. Especially in the Gousao Tree section, the dike body collapsed and was in imminent danger. Thanks to Commander Ye's effective supervision of the construction and protection, the situation has now been turned from danger to safety. It was touch and go. Upon hearing that Commander Ye resigned due to illness, we were extremely shocked. We fear that a slight neglect in flood control will result in failure. We earnestly request your swift retention, so that he can immediately continue to be responsible and achieve complete success." In Wuchang, the construction of the second line of defense has now begun, starting from Hanyangmen and ending at Lufangkou. Because transportation of soil is more convenient, it can be completed within days. The original flood control committee had inconsistent authority. Today's plenary committee meeting decided to change the organization and appointed Director of the Construction Department Liu Shoupeng as the chairman, taking full responsibility for unified command, and Public Security Director Cai Mengjian and County Magistrate Yang Disheng as deputy directors. Yang was also ordered by the military camp to fully command the rescue work on the Wuzhong Dike, and another battalion of soldiers was dispatched to assist. If the water does not rise again, there may be no cause for concern. (17th)</p>
<h3>Fujian Province Military Progress in Suppressing Bandits, Zhang, Zhou, Liu, and Su's Remaining Forces Now Being Encircled and Suppressed by Various Armies</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Communication: After the division of districts and pacification in Fujian Province, the southern and northern Fujian areas have gradually been cleared of bandits. However, in Yongding and Pinghe counties in western Fujian, and in Dabu and Raoping areas bordering Guangdong, there are two groups led by Zhang Dingcheng and Zhou Lixing, who are harassing. They have been encircled and suppressed by the Fujian Army's Li Mo'an Division and the Guangdong Army's Huang Renhuan Division, but the bandits are able to break through and flee, making it difficult to wipe them out. After consultations between the armies of the two provinces, it was learned that the bandits were able to survive because they were familiar with the terrain, used remote villages and deep mountain valleys as nests, and used various means to oppress or lure villagers to be used by them and to provide them with food. Therefore, it was decided to implement a policy of clearing the fields and fortifying the walls, ordering the scattered people living in remote mountain villages to move within the defense lines of the stationed troops, taking out all food and utensils, and demolishing the houses so that the bandits could not gain a foothold on the plains. They can only flee into the mountains, and then the army will block the roads in and out of the mountains, so that they are surrounded in the mountains and cannot sneak into the villages to loot. Then, patrol teams will be organized to investigate and arrest scattered bandits in the border areas of the two provinces, in order to eliminate them as soon as possible. As for the Liu Ying and Su Yu groups in the eastern Fujian area, in the areas bordering Fuding, Shouning, and the Zhejiang Province counties of Taishun and Qingyuan, they once sneaked into the Zhejiang border, but were intercepted by the Zhejiang Security Team and retreated into Fujian territory. Colluding with local Communists Xie Zuolin, Fan Yisheng, and others, they are active in the three counties of Shouning, Xiapu, and Fu'an. Now, the 87th Division and the newly编 Tenth Division of the Security Regiment have each dispatched a part of their troops to advance towards the bandit areas. Yesterday, the Security Regiment defeated the Fan Yisheng group at Xietan, more than 30 li away from Shouning, killing four bandits and capturing seven alive. The remaining bandits fled towards the back mountain, and the regiment is pursuing them. Also, Liu brigade of the 87th Division also made contact with the Xie Zuolin group in the Tuoxi area of Xiapu County. Liu brigade selected soldiers to organize a lightly armed guerrilla team, with 20 to 30 people in a group, to go deep into the bandit area to search and clear the ambush. Furthermore, the First Regiment of the New Tenth Division encountered a pseudo-guerrilla team in Guanyang, Fu'an, the day before yesterday, and a fierce battle broke out. They held each other for a day and a night, but the bandits did not retreat. Afterwards, the government troops launched a forward charge, and the bandits could not hold on and began to flee towards Shangqi. Guanyang was then recovered by the government troops. Yesterday, the New Tenth Division dispatched personnel to escort more than 200 rifles, several mortars, and other trophies seized in the bandit suppression operations in eastern Fujian to the province for delivery to the Ordnance Department for storage.

<h3>A Lubricating Old Man Accuses Ma Zhanshan of Forcibly Claiming to Be His Son, Who Had Escaped Out as a Child, After Investigation, the False Accusation Is Reversed</h3>
<p>Tianjin Communication: Ma Zhanshan has been living in seclusion in the British Concession of Tianjin for a long time. Unexpectedly, a few days ago, he was suddenly accused by an old man from Fengrun County, Ma Rong, who claimed that Ma Zhanshan was his own son, who had left home as a child. Now that he had found his whereabouts, he went to seek recognition, but was rejected. Therefore, he had no choice but to accuse him of abandoning his parents. After the District Prosecutor's Office approved the complaint, it immediately summoned both parties to court for investigation at 10:00 a.m. on the 12th of this month. The plaintiff, Ma Rong, reported his arrival, wearing a blue gauze mandarin jacket, a blue feather gauze gown, blue silk socks, blue formal wool shoes, and an old-fashioned straw hat. Although he was over seventy years old, he was still in good spirits. On that day, Ma Zhanshan sent his secretary, Du Gouruo, to report on his behalf. At about 11:00 a.m., the prosecutor, Yu Jiancheng, opened the court and interrogated them separately. He questioned the plaintiff in great detail and briefly questioned the defendant's representative. He ordered the court to be opened at 10:00 a.m. on the 13th, and Ma Zhanshan himself had to appear in court.</p>
<p>Ma Zhanshan's Statement</p>
<p>According to Ma Zhanshan, "My ancestral home is indeed Fengrun County, but I have been living in Huaide County, Liaoning, for about ten generations. My father's name was Ma Chun. He had three brothers, ranking third. My eldest uncle, Ma Guang, and my second uncle, Ma Ling, are both deceased. Now I have several nephews who are all in Tianjin. My father died of illness in Huaide on September 26th of the sixth year of the Republic of China, at the age of 57. At that time, I was serving as a battalion commander. When he was buried, all relatives and friends were notified, and everyone knew about it. My mother, Liu, died of illness when I was eleven years old. I was taught by my father most of the time. This spring, Ma Rong, an old man, asked to see me. I met him twice in the courtyard. He said that I was his son and that I had a hitching post behind my left ear. I asked him to touch it, but there was no such characteristic. He said that I was not the real Ma Zhanshan and must be an impostor. I thought that he might have lost a son and was sick with worry, so I did not want to investigate further. I asked people to persuade him to leave. Unexpectedly, he actually filed a complaint in court. According to him, I am 52 years old and was born on the eighth day of the twelfth lunar month, which is completely wrong. I am now 51 years old and was born on October 25th at midnight. The accusations are obviously absurd. Because I have special circumstances, it is inconvenient for me to appear in court to confront him, but if necessary, I will definitely appear in court in person."</p>
<p>Ma Rong's Statement</p>
<p>According to Ma Rong, "I am currently 73 years old, a native of Fengrun County, east of Tianjin, living in Zhongxin Village. I have two sons and one daughter. The eldest son, named Zhanshan, was born to my ex-wife, Lü. The second son was born to my second wife in Qianjinzai, outside the pass, and is named Shoushan. He is currently 33 years old and still outside the pass. Zhanshan's childhood name was Laohu. He was born on the eighth day of the twelfth lunar month in the tenth year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty. After he was born, I went to Qianjinzai to work as a cook in a shop and did not often go home. When Zhanshan was seven years old, in the sixteenth year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu, his mother, Lü, died of illness. He then begged for a living with his "two braids," begging during the day and sleeping on the streets at night, which was very pitiful. Later, I returned to Fengrun and managed to send the two children to a friend's house for foster care. I still went out to earn a living. When Zhanshan was twelve years old, his sister died of illness, and Zhanshan also disappeared. After inquiring everywhere, there was no news. I returned to Qianjinzai and remarried. After the September 18th Incident, I heard about the anti-Japanese hero Ma Zhanshan, and I suspected that he was my lost son, but I had no way to prove it. Later, a fellow villager, Bai, who was a train driver, said that he had seen Ma Zhanyou and that he was indeed my lost son. I then had the intention to find him, but I could not pass through because of the chaos. Later, I heard that his troops had arrived in Harbin. I went there alone, but there was a flood in that place, and I did not succeed. On October 26th of last year, I went to Beiping to inquire, but he was not in Beiping. I returned to Tangyou to my relatives and entrusted Ma Fa of Xiaomazhuang, Fengrun County, to inquire. Because Ma was the father-in-law of the former Tianjin Mayor Zhang Ting'e, I was helped by him and received a letter from Mayor Zhang. Later, I received a reply saying that Ma Zhanshan was indeed a native of Fengrun County and now lives in the British Concession of Tianjin. Because I had lost my son for forty years, I was very happy to have found his whereabouts. So I came to Tianjin on the eighth day of the first lunar month this year. I went to the British Concession to find him, but his servants would not allow us father and son to meet. Unable to do so, I went back again and entrusted Ma Fa to write a letter, writing in detail my photo and the childhood of Zhanshan. Later, Ma Zhanshan replied, still not admitting it, saying that I was talking nonsense. So I came to find him many times again, but still could not see him. Once, he sent a person surnamed Fu to see me, and I scolded him. The last time, I saw him inside the door, but he still would not recognize me, so I filed a complaint."</p>
<p>False Accusation Is Reversed</p>
<p>At about 11:00 a.m. on the 13th, the court was reopened for investigation. Ma Zhanshan did not appear in court and sent his secretary, Du Gouruo, again, bringing with him an enlarged full-body photo of Ma Zhanshan himself. Regarding the two points of Ma Rong's accusation, (1) the son that Ma Rong recognized as lost had a hitching post next to his ear, but Ma Zhanshan did not. (2) The son that Ma Rong lost was 52 years old and was born on the eighth day of the twelfth lunar month, while Ma Zhanshan himself was 51 years old and was born on October 24th. In addition, Ma Zhanshan lived in Huaide for ten generations, and everyone knew about it. There were relatives and friends who could testify. Moreover, the son that Ma Rong lost was originally named Jinshan, while Ma Zhanshan was originally named Zhenbang. When he reached the position of battalion commander, Wu Junsheng changed his name to Zhanshan on his behalf. He refuted them one by one. Ma Rong still said that the photo was a forgery and that Ma Zhanshan himself had to appear in court or list three generations of ancestors. The court believed that Ma Rong's reasons were insufficient and dismissed him immediately, allowing for further investigation next time. At the same time, Du Gouruo, representing Ma Zhanshan, filed a charge of false accusation against Ma Rong, using the above points as reasons to prove that Ma Rong fabricated facts and insulted his reputation. The Prosecutor's Office immediately accepted the case, interrogated him, and ordered Ma Rong to post bail and await summons. This matter has proven that although Ma Rong did lose a son, it was not the Ma Zhanshan he was referring to. He only had this recognition because he missed his son so much. It is said that when Ma Rong went to Ma's residence several times before, Ma Zhanshan thought that he was old and missed his son, which was understandable, and intended to help him so that he could go to find him. Unexpectedly, Ma Rong believed that this Ma was that Ma and ended up filing a complaint. As a result, the evidence was not accurate, which can be said to be superfluous. (13th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Holds Police Guard Conference</h3>
<p>—Proposals Focus on Training and Funding—</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: Since Guangdong Province has organized police guard teams in various counties, districts, and villages, the reserve and preparatory teams of various counties have been trained one after another, and the local self-defense forces have gradually established a foundation. However, in terms of funding, the fees have been taken from the field donation. Recently, the financial authorities changed the land tax levy and cancelled the food money. The local police guard funding association should also be abolished at the same time. In the future, police fees will be paid by the county government from the land tax retention counties. In order to coordinate the police guard affairs of the entire province, the authorities have scheduled a provincial police guard conference on the 8th of this month. Prior to that, each pacification area was ordered to first convene the deputy directors of the compilation and training offices of each county in the pacification area to hold a police guard preparatory meeting in each district office in order to collect proposals and submit them to the conference for discussion. Until the end of last month, the police guard preliminary meetings in each pacification area were held in turn. The provincial police guard conference was held as scheduled on the 8th of this month. The meeting place was in the guard office of the headquarters on Yuehua Road. The attendees included Luo Xianxiang, director of the military affairs department of the East District Pacification Office, Wang Hongrao, director of the military affairs department of the South District Pacification Office, Liu Zhenyuan, director of the military affairs department of the Northwest District Pacification Office, Liu Shiliang, director of the military affairs department of the Qiongyai Pacification Office, Liu Weishan, director of the military affairs department of the Central District Pacification Office, and Feng Zhuoxun, director of the guard office of the headquarters, police guard inspectors Xue Hanguang, Chen Jing, Geng Hanchi, Liang Fangpu, etc. The opening ceremony was held at 8:00 a.m. that morning. Chairman Chen Jitang gave a speech to the officers, with the main idea of ​​encouraging the officers in charge to earnestly train the police guard teams, create a strong popular armed force, defend the local area, directly defend themselves and indirectly defend the country. Chen left his seat after speaking, and then Chairman Feng Zhuoxun reported on the meeting matters. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon. In the afternoon, a meeting was held to sort out the proposals. The meeting continued on the 9th to discuss the proposals. It was heard that there were more than 100 proposals from various districts. Those with the same nature were merged separately, for a total of more than 80 cases. The cases were mostly about reforms in training and issues of income and expenditure. The meeting will not be adjourned until all cases have been discussed.</p>
<h3>Qin Dechun Delays Return to Zhangyuan Due to Illness, Song Zheyuan's Whereabouts Still Undetermined, Xiao Zhenying Returns to Beiping to Comfort Qin on Behalf of Song</h3>
<p>Beiping Communication: Regarding the position of Chairman of the Chahar Provincial Government, since Song Zheyuan was dismissed and the Central Government ordered Qin Dechun, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, to act as his agent, Qin initially sent a telegram expressing his desire to advance and retreat with Song due to moral considerations, leaving Zhang to come to Beiping. Later, due to a sense of responsibility, he was responsible in Beiping for handling the Zhangbei negotiations with the Japanese side. Afterwards, because Song's whereabouts have not yet been resolved, his desire to leave became stronger and his intentions became particularly negative. Chahar Provincial Committee member Xiao Zhenying had been running around to stabilize the Chahar situation as soon as possible, but the result was to wait for the central government's decision.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Central Government's dismissal order, Song Zheyuan resolutely left Zhangyuan and returned to Tianjin to rest, taking care of the overall situation. Qin, who had followed Song for many years, although he received an explicit order to act as his agent, did not actually take office due to his private friendship. His continuation of handling the Zhangbei negotiations after requesting resignation was probably driven by a sense of responsibility to serve the country. During the negotiation period, Qin's hard work and willingness to bear hardships were known to everyone. Therefore, after the settlement of the negotiations, Qin planned to move to a quiet place to recuperate, both to treat his insomnia and to change the air.</p>
<p>Qin Dechun was originally scheduled to return to Zhangyuan within days to handle the affairs of the Civil Affairs Department. However, because there were matters to be negotiated with the Japanese side in handling the aftermath of the Zhangbei negotiations, the date of return to Zhang has not yet been determined. Matsui, the military liaison officer of the Kwantung Army stationed in Zhangyuan, came to Beiping yesterday (13th) morning and visited Qin with Takahashi Tan, the military attaché of the Japanese Embassy in Beiping, for a long talk. The content was nothing more than discussing the aftermath of eastern Chahar. According to unofficial sources that evening, at the end of the talks, Qin had been working hard for a long time and had collapsed once. He was revived with ginger soup.</p>
<p>So far today (13th), it has been proven that Qin suffered hemoptysis last night (12th), and the situation is serious. Many Chinese and Western doctors were urgently invited to diagnose and verify that the small blood vessels at the costal cartilage joint between the eighth and ninth ribs of Qin had ruptured, and it was not lung disease. Although there was no major danger, the doctor ordered absolute rest and no movement. Qin originally planned to be admitted to the hospital for treatment, but he had to stay at home to rest. Upon hearing of his illness, people came to visit and express their condolences, but Qin did not receive them.</p>
<p>Xiao Zhenying went to Tianjin on official business a few days ago and originally planned to stay for a short time. Upon receiving the news of Qin's illness, he returned to Beiping at 6:42 p.m. today (13th). According to him, Qin's illness was not a major problem, and he hoped that he would recover soon. His return to Beiping was purely to visit him. Song (Zheyuan) was very concerned about Qin's illness. His trip to Sichuan was temporarily postponed. After leaving the station, Xiao went to Fuyou Street to meet him and conveyed Song's intentions.</p>
<h3>Jiangbei Canal Works Bureau Prevents Yellow River Water from Entering Jiangsu, Provincial Government Orders Canal Works Bureau to Take Strict Precautions</h3>
<p>Yangzhou Communication: On the 14th, the Jiangsu Provincial Government approved a telegram from the Yellow River Conservancy Commission stating that after the Xiaomin embankment between Dongzhuang and Linpuji in Shandong Province overflowed, the water勢猛涨不已 rose sharply, and the water势恐将趋向鲁西湖河 was feared to be trending towards the Luxi Lake River, and the Jiangsu Canal would also be in a tight spot, so they hoped that they would order them to be strictly on guard. Regarding this case, the Provincial Government had previously received a telegram from Commissioner Xu of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission through the Construction Department and immediately telegraphed orders to various counties to rush to repair the embankments within their jurisdictions in order to be prepared and dispatched Zhou Guangyue, a guiding engineer from the Construction Department, to inspect. Now, a reply telegram has been sent to the Jiangbei Canal Works Bureau here to step up prevention to avoid danger. Upon receiving the telegram, the Bureau immediately relayed a telegram to Ge Hanlou, the head of the Engineering Section of the Bureau stationed in Qingjiangpu, to be the special commissioner for supervising the repair of embankments in Pizhou, Suyu, Sihong, and Huai'an counties to prevent the Yellow River, and ordered personnel to go to the four counties to join the respective county magistrates in rushing to repair the embankments and stepping up prevention. At the same time, Feng Dan, the director of the Huaipizhou section of the project office, was ordered to assist in the compliance, and the county magistrates of Huaipizhou, Suyu, Sihong counties were ordered to investigate all embankment projects in their territory. If there were any defects, they should quickly conscript laborers to repair them and not delay in the slightest. Furthermore, at 5:00 p.m. on the 15th, the Canal Works Bureau received a telegram from Director Feng of the Huaipizhou section stating that Shandong Province was planning to divert the Yellow River water into Weishan Lake, requesting that the province be consulted and requested that the Shandong Provincial Government be stopped as soon as possible to avoid harming neighboring areas and harming northern Jiangsu. Upon receiving the report, the Bureau also telegraphed the province requesting approval to send a telegram to stop them.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Water Patrol Team Captures Bandits</p>
<p>The water patrol team of this county reported that there were bandit ships berthed at the Huang and Qiao ports at the junction of Song and Jin. The squad leader Xia Shutang and Li Xiusheng led a team to search and arrest. When they arrived at the scene, a man on a bandit ship窜 out jumped out and escaped ashore. They chased him to the vicinity of the Fengshui Longshen Temple and captured him. According to him, his name was Gu Alin, 21 years old, from Jinshan, and he made a living by fishing. They then went to the boat and copied the objects, including fifteen pieces of clothes, four pieces of silver ornaments, and four pawn tickets. They were immediately escorted to the team headquarters for interrogation and sent to the county government for handling according to the law.</p>
<p>Red Cross Society Appeals for Relief</p>
<p>The Songjiang Branch of the Red Cross Society of China has been handling the reception of refugees in Zhejiang Province at the reception center and sending them back to their places of origin. The expenses are very large. Although the chairman, Zhou Xuewen, and others have made donations, the deficit is too large, and fundraising is difficult due to the passage of time. They have no choice but to telegraph the National Government Relief Committee to appeal for relief. The original telegram said, "Xu Ci, Chairman of the Relief Committee of the National Government, the National Government Relief Committee, the case is that this association has repeatedly telegraphed for instructions before handling the reception center for refugees in Zhejiang Province. Wang Yiting and Yingguang have consulted several times and agreed to be responsible for sending them back. Then, on February 29th of this year, Jian Dai telegram opened by the Jun Council, and respectfully learned from Qin Dian that thousands of refugees from Xiashao and other places escaped to Song, and your Council raised funds to set up a reception center, and you have set up a reception center with enthusiasm and kindness. In addition to sending a letter to the Shanghai Fundraising Early Disaster Relief Association of various provinces for deliberation, a special telegram will be issued to reply, etc. are all on file. This association has been approved by the Jun Council to assist. We started to act with a good courage. It's hard to open the door to charity, and the number of victims has been increasing. More than 16,000 people in total came to the station for support. Among them, Haining suffered the most serious disaster, so the number of people was also large. The former county magistrate of Haining, Wang, tried his best to care for the victims. My colleagues at the meeting deeply admire him. Afterwards, we discussed sending the victims. On the 11th of the month, the new regulations were revised and no transportation was allowed. This association could not send them for a while, delaying the month and the cost increased. The handling was not good, and the blame could not be resigned. Fortunately, the Red Cross heard about the two executive directors Wen Lin, and repeatedly telegraphed the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to inform the ministry. Meng Fu Nian Zai Bao, Yunru asked, and then won the allocation of transportation, reaching six times. The victims in Zhejiang Province were able to return to their hometowns and work with peace of mind. My colleagues in the association should thank you with nine bows. Now, the association has checked the accounts of various items, in addition to the food and rice, thousands of stones, the medicine, and the purchase of train tickets for the victims to return to their homes, and the round-trip transportation expenses of the staff, etc., for a total of about 20,000 yuan. After offsetting the income and expenditure, there is still a debt of more than 4,000 yuan, and the rice account alone is still more than 2,000 yuan. This association is a legal charitable organization and not a borrower, and the credit prospect is related to the overall situation. We have always admired the Jun Council for upholding the Prime Minister's purpose of saving the victims, planning the national relief atmosphere, and filling the truth with strength. We dare to ask for a remedy to complete the reputation of this association, and the national red will also have glory. If you ask again, Songjiang is only a small place with weak resources. (1) During the Xinwei flood, all parties enthusiastically contributed a large amount, but after the end, the government did not have a cross of praise. (2) During the January 28th Shanghai War, the local donations were not small, and the remaining money was forcibly retained for other local purposes. No one was allowed to allocate a penny to provide assistance. Therefore, good people cannot but be indifferent, and charitable organizations cannot but be affected. Recently, I learned that a county held a county government meeting and embezzled more than 15,000 yuan of the remaining money from the Xinwei flood. The Jun Council is busy with the greater and distant matters, and does not have time to consider the district. If this is the case, the future will be long. How can we persuade those who are kind and charitable? This is to report the situation. I still ask you to correct it in order to maintain good deeds. In short, this association was approved by the Jun Council to assist in the past, and had to cry out in the future. When there is pain, parents will be called, and human nature is generally the same. Moreover, when the victims were sent back to their hometowns in the middle, because the Railway Department approved free of charge, the transportation expenses assumed by the Jun Council were not used at all. They can be used to relieve the disaster. The telegram is frightening, and I am waiting for orders in an urgent manner. Zhu Jiuwang, Chairman of the Songjiang Branch of the Red Cross Society of China, Sheng Yuanyin, Speaker, Geng Jiaji, Chairman of the Economic Committee, Zhou Xuewen, Chairman of the Board, fish seal."</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Chief of Public Safety Bureau Resigns to Take Responsibility</p>
<p>Since the occurrence of the bizarre murder case in Guanlong Lane within the city, over twenty days have passed. Although the patrol officer suspected of being a major suspect has been handed over to the court for investigation, the true perpetrator has not yet been apprehended. On the 18th, the First Precinct dispatched a police officer to Hangzhou to arrest the Buddhist monk Keguang, who had left Suzhou before the incident. Zhang Han'gan, Chief of the Public Safety Bureau, felt that the case involved as many as seven police officers and that Patrol Officer Hong Shiqin seemed to have incited the crime, while the bureau had failed to take adequate precautions. Therefore, on the 18th, he submitted a request to the Department of Civil Affairs, asking to resign to take responsibility.</p>
<p>Middle School Student Drowns While Practicing Swimming</p>
<p>Sun Yuqing, a high school student at Suzhou Chunyi Middle School, was 18 years old and from Wuxi. His father was a teacher at National Central University. On the evening of the 17th, Sun Yuqing and four or five classmates practiced swimming by the riverbank outside Loumen North Gate. Because Sun Yuqing was not familiar with the water, he tragically drowned. His classmates retrieved his body and reported it to the police precinct in charge, who then reported it to the local prosecutor's office. On the 18th, officials were dispatched to conduct an inspection, and relatives and friends were instructed to prepare a coffin for burial. His family has been notified by his classmates and will come to Suzhou to handle the aftermath.</p>
<p>Water Police Chief Inspects Water Police</p>
<p>Zhou Weilie, chief of the Second Water Police District stationed in Suzhou, along with Inspector Jin Xiangtai, departed from Suzhou to inspect the Seventh and Eighth Squads in Kunshan and Changshu. The day before yesterday, they came from Yu to Wuxi and first went to Ganlu to inspect the Ninth Squad and its first detachment. Yesterday (the 17th), they continued to Huangbudun to inspect the headquarters of the Ninth Squad, and at 9 o'clock, they inspected the Second Detachment stationed in Nanfangquan. It is scheduled to go to Yixing today (the 18th) for inspection. According to Chief Zhou, the inspection showed that the performance of each squad was good. The provincial government is indeed determined to improve the water police, but due to economic constraints, it has not been possible to implement the plan fully. The salaries of the water police are now not as heavily in arrears as before, currently only two months behind. If the provincial economy becomes more prosperous, the future of the water police will naturally have renewed hope, he said.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Reorganization and Establishment of the All-Zhejiang Native Place Association</p>
<p>The Ningbo and Shaoxing natives in Kunshan County originally had a native place association organization, with a history of over a hundred years. The association's assets were quite substantial. However, there were few members, so the association's affairs were handled by the chairman, Xu Jingbo. Despite Xu's painstaking efforts for over twenty years, he still failed to gain the favor of his fellow villagers. At the members' meeting on the 6th of this year, Xu resigned from his position. The members then elected seven people, including Li Zhihui and Xu Chufang, to prepare for the reorganization of the Zhejiang Native Place Association to show expansion and solicit members. Approval was immediately obtained from the political authorities for preparation. By the 15th, everything was ready. The establishment meeting was held at 10 a.m. Officials from the county party headquarters and the county government were sent to attend and provide guidance. Representatives from various agencies also attended the meeting. Over two hundred members were present. Li Zhihui served as chairman, performing the rituals. Li reported on the preparations. The association's constitution was then discussed, followed by the election of nine executive committee members: Li Zhihui, Chen Boying, Ma Huating, Chen Yuxian, Han Zhimin, Chen Yuyu, Xu Chufang, Guo Linshan, and Kuang Chunfan. Zhang Wenxin, Chen Zhiren, and Wang Jianbo were elected as alternate executive committee members. Yin Shenong, Xu Jingbo, and Luo Xingwei were elected as supervisory committee members. Chen Minglan was elected as an alternate supervisory committee member. The meeting adjourned after taking a group photo and having a meal.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Barber Kills Modern Wife</p>
<p>Ma Awu, a 28-year-old resident of No. 14 Bodugang, outside the South Gate of this county, worked as a barber in the Xinxin Barber Shop on Jiejing Bridge. His wife, A Ren, dressed in stylish clothes and leather shoes, had an affair with Zhao Jinkui, who performed Tanhuang opera. Recently, she eloped with Zhao and secretly made a hundred-year pact to live together in Zhou Tieqiao, on the border of Wuxi and Yixing, to pursue their love. This was discovered by her husband, Ma Awu, who went to Yixing with a sharp knife to find them. He found them in front of a theater in Zhou Tieqiao. In a fit of anger, Ma pulled out the knife and stabbed A Ren twice in the chest, killing her on the spot. Afterwards, Ma surrendered himself to the local public safety station, stating what had happened. The station sent police to arrest Zhao Jinkui, the adulterer, and escorted them to the county government for interrogation. The county government sent officials to conduct an autopsy.</p>
<p>Fifty-Nine Straw Sheds Burned Down</p>
<p>The Niupengtou area outside the Tongyang Bridge South, outside the South Gate, is a gathering place for immigrants from north of the Yangtze River, with straw sheds lined up densely. At 4 p.m. the day before yesterday (the 17th), a fire broke out in the straw shed of A San's family, accidentally spreading to the neighboring sheds. The fire blazed into the sky, making it difficult to control. Fire brigades from various sections rushed to the scene to extinguish the fire, which was eventually put out. A total of fifty-nine sheds were burned down, with losses estimated at over ten thousand yuan. The cause of the fire was determined to be Liu's wife, who was cooking a fried egg dish and negligently left the fire near firewood.</p>
<p>Dissolution of Eleven Cooperatives</p>
<p>The county government of this county previously requested the Department of Construction to dissolve eleven organizations that were loosely organized, with stagnant businesses, and were virtually defunct. These were: the Third District Wansi Bridge Silkworm Cooperative, the Seventh District Yingnan Township Irrigation Cooperative, the Fourth District Motang Township Credit Cooperative, the Second District Xizhuang Township Majiaqiao Credit Purchase Guarantee Cooperative, the Ninth District Qijia Township Credit Cooperative, Ganke Township Credit Cooperative, Wujiagang Credit Cooperative, Xinqiao Township Credit Cooperative, the Fifth District Batou Credit Cooperative, Longtangan Credit Cooperative, and the Fourth District Shengdian Township Credit Purchase Cooperative. The Department of Construction has now issued an order approving the dissolution and liquidation according to law.</p>
<p>County Magistrate Wang Streamlines Prison Sentences</p>
<p>County Magistrate Wang Baoxuan, concerned that the recent hot weather and outbreak of epidemics have caused overcrowding in prisons, especially with a large number of opium offenders (about 100 cases) awaiting trial, leading to daily deaths, believed it was imperative to streamline the situation. He visited the county prison substation and other places with Wu Gengshi, the director of the adjudication division, and instructed Director Wu to actively adjudicate pending opium cases, pronounce judgments according to law, and order those already convicted to be released on bail or have their sentences converted to fines.</p>
<p>Appeal to Exempt Cloth Factories from Double Taxation</p>
<p>The Cloth Factory Trade Association of this county stated that factories such as Meiheng, Daxin, Jinghua, Yunhua, Zhenye, and Xinyi are all located in the rural areas and have already paid business tax. In the urban areas, they only have transshipment locations. The import and export of yarn and cloth are not sales activities. Now, the Business Tax Bureau is ordering them to pay tax, which is not only double taxation but also increases the cost of national loans and hinders sales. This is contrary to the government's aim to promote industry. Yesterday, they sent a letter to the county chamber of commerce, requesting that, according to the Business Tax Collection Regulations, the Department of Finance and the Department of Industry be instructed to order the bureau to stop this practice to protect domestic goods. They also requested that the Business Tax Bureau be informed in advance that direct collection from cloth factories should be suspended until instructions are received from the departments to avoid disputes.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Autumn Locusts Found Again in the Seventh District</p>
<p>Locust nymphs previously appeared in the reeds of Zhaiqiao, Fangqian Qianlingtai, and Dacheng and other four townships in the Seventh District of Wujin. The county government sent officials to the countryside to organize locust control associations with the district, township, and village chiefs to mobilize villagers to actively catch them, and the infestation was eventually suppressed, without damage to the seedlings. However, the locusts were not caught in time in Yixing, so swarms of locusts occasionally flew over. The Department of Construction ordered that measures be taken to eliminate them. It has been reported that autumn locusts have recently been found in the Lingtai Township area of the district, still in the nymph stage. District Chief Qu Hao, upon receiving the report, in addition to sending personnel to supervise the township farmers to search and catch them, urgently came to the city yesterday (the 17th) to report the situation. He then returned to the district. He Xiqi, the deputy director of the Sericulture Improvement District, inspected the actual situation on the afternoon of the 18th, in order to start eliminating them and avoid the spread of the harm.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Select High-Quality Seeds for Grain Storage</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government considers warehouse storage an important administrative priority for famine relief. In recent years, various counties have suffered from frequent droughts and floods, and impoverished farmers have been unable to afford seeds. Although various counties have the practice of storing grain for seed, it has been stored for too long, and its germination ability is limited. In the future, when counties increase their grain reserves, 70% of the increase should be stored for famine relief, and 30% should be used to select high-quality seeds, distinguishing their types, and storing them in separate warehouses. The following points should be noted regarding the storage of high-quality seeds: (1) Seeds produced in the current year should be selected for purchase and storage; (2) Purchase should be made locally so that the seeds can adapt to the local climate and fully develop; (3) Seeds with higher yields should be selected, and those that are free from insect pests and diseases; (4) Attention should be paid to the ventilation and humidity control of the warehouse to prevent the stored grains from losing their ability to germinate; (5) Before storage, wind winnowing or screening should be used to eliminate inferior seeds and remove impurities; (6) If the seeds are distributed to farmers for use, the warehouse should guide the farmers in using saltwater to select seeds and immersing them in warm water. The parts regarding storing grain for famine relief should still follow the various regulations of the local warehouse storage management rules, the outline of the measures for storing grain for famine relief, and the detailed rules for the food management committee of each county, strictly managing the storage and paying close attention to the quality when purchasing and storing the grain. The provincial government ordered the Department of Construction to select and dispatch specialized personnel during the harvest period to investigate and designate the best seeds for purchase and storage. It also formulated a method for managing seeds and issued instructions to the county governments to comply with it.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Children's Year Implementation Committee Meeting</p>

<p>Provincial Electricity Authorities Liaise for Flood Control</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial flood control authority has designated four districts to be responsible for flood control, which was issued by the provincial government on the 16th. Now, the Grand Canal Engineering Bureau has received a telegram from Provincial Chairman Chen, stating that, in order to coordinate and respond to areas that need flood control and involve more than two districts, the relevant flood control authorities should promptly inform and contact each other to facilitate progress. This is of utmost importance. In addition to sending telegrams separately, it is especially ordered to comply. On the 17th, the Canal Engineering Bureau forwarded the telegram to the Jipeng section for compliance.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Crackdown on Drug Trafficking Organization</p>
<p>Song Mingqi, Chief of the Public Safety Bureau of Nantong County, believing that drugs within the county had not been eradicated, secretly gathered information. The drug trafficking gang had a well-planned distribution network, with contacts in Liuqiao and deliveries in city hotels. Undercover officers made purchases, and the locations of the gang's lairs were discovered: one on the west end of the city, at Duanping Bridge, and another in the Water Police Station Lane, behind the Wanlong Pawnshop in Hexi. Detective teams simultaneously raided the locations, arresting key suspects Yu Yongxue, Shen Kangyi, Bai Yucai, and Qian Zhenzi Liangyu. A large quantity of heroin, ledgers, and Red Pill brand stamps and wooden seals were seized. Witnesses and evidence were handed over to the county government. Key suspect Liu Zizhi is still at large.</p>
<p>Selection of Administrative Commissioner Undecided</p>
<p>Zheng Yitong, the Administrative Inspector of the Nanjiang District, has been promoted to a member of the Jiangsu Provincial Government. Luo Shishi was originally appointed as his successor, but Luo declined the position. The selection of a candidate is currently undecided.</p>
<p>Riverbed Burial Case Taken to Public Prosecution</p>
<p>Chen Yuanxuan, from Yuxi, had a conflict with local ruffian Cao Si due to frequenting prostitutes and gambling. Chen was fatally struck in the waist by Cao with a wooden stool. Realizing he had caused a death, Cao Si, along with Meng Sanjiaozi, Cai Er, and Xu Haikui, discussed burying Chen Yuanxuan's body at the bottom of the Shijia River.

<p>Since the opening of the county's Village Chief Training Institute, regulations stipulate that it be held in two phases, each lasting three weeks, entirely using a military system. Internal facilities are extremely strict. Most of the village chiefs in training cannot endure the hardship, and impersonation has occurred. On the 15th, it was discovered that Tan Liurong, the village chief of Nantancun, Xienan Township, First District, had his hired laborer impersonate him, and Yao Hongsheng, the village chief of Liubao, Dingshu Township, Seventh District, had his younger brother Yao Xiaobing impersonate him. The institute's director, Yan Jian, verified the facts and sent them to the county for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Resolution of Weicheng Silk Factory Dispute</p>
<p>All the male and female workers of the Jiaxing Weicheng Qingji Silk Factory appealed to the Party and government for relief because the factory had decided to increase working hours and reduce wages starting from the 8th. After many days of mediation by the Party and government authorities and Gu Suming, chairman of the county chamber of commerce, an agreement was finally reached because neither side was willing to yield. The workers resumed work on the 12th. It is understood that from then on, wages would be increased by four points per machine and per worker. The three-shift system was changed to a two-shift system, and wages were increased by five points. The tenth-day promotion was still given as before. Both sides have reached an understanding and the dispute has been resolved.</p>

<p>Ungrateful Son Viciously Beats Mother, Breaking Her Arm</p>
<p>Wang Zicai, the owner of the Ximen Tailai Inn, was extremely disobedient. On the 17th, he demanded money from his blind mother and, when he did not get it, viciously beat her. His wife also assisted in the assault, breaking the blind old woman's left arm bone. She fell to the ground in pain and cried miserably. After someone reported it to the Public Security Section, the injured person was sent to the county for examination, which confirmed the injury. Immediate medical treatment was ordered, and the ungrateful son and daughter-in-law were ordered to be arrested and severely punished.</p>

The bandits who had been captured and sentenced to death were Long Guofan, Peng Jun, Yu Chengji, Xu Buxiang, Zai Shihe, and two accomplices, Zhang Jiayou and Zhang Jiesan. Zhang Jiesan was the captain of the county government's secret investigation team and was suspected of taking bribes to release bandits from the Hengyu Shigaodian in the city.</p>
<h3>Correspondence</h3>
<p>Letter from Lawyer Zhang Tianbai</p>
<p>To the editor: I am writing on behalf of my client, Pan Baorong, who claims that he was astonished to read a news item titled "Xiding Thoroughly Investigates Qingwen Zhang Wu's Embezzlement" in the local correspondence section of the Shen Bao on July 9th. After investigation, it was found that Zhang Baorong's position is as the drawing team leader and internal inspector. According to the inspection rules, he has the authority to correct errors in Wu's map. Zhang Baorong has corrected no less than thousands of Qingzhang maps in various villages in Jiading County, as evidenced by the land registration book. Moreover, there is no ownerless public land in Jiading Fifth District, except for Yangzhong, so Beixin Township, where Baorong resides, is part of the Fifth District and is naturally no exception. Furthermore, the land deeds purchased by Baorong have the signatures of the original owners and intermediaries, so how could they be forged? All of the Sichuan products owned by Baorong have been applied for registration, and the public announcement is about to expire. No affected owners have filed a complaint. This clearly shows that Baorong has not engaged in any embezzlement while serving in the Qingzhang team. Moreover, the Jiangsu Provincial Land Bureau has not sent anyone to Jiading to investigate this case recently. Ribao Rong has been sick and has requested to resign since July 1st, but has not yet received Tenfeng's approval after half a month. Therefore, the rumor of suspension is unfounded. It is evident that all the reported sections are untrue. Therefore, I am writing to the Shen Bao on behalf of my client to request an immediate correction. I hope that you will publish this letter in the "Correspondence" section. I am, [signed] Lawyer Zhang Tianbai, July 18th.</p>

<h3>Opium Treatment Hospitals to be Established in Zhabei, Western Shanghai, Pudong, etc.; as Many Beds as Possible to be Provided for Forced Admission</h3>
<p>According to Guomin She, since the establishment of the Anti-Opium Commission in Maojianong, Nanshi, this city, on the 1st of this month, the commission has been implementing measures for opium prohibition. Police Chief Cai Jingjun has instructed all bureaus and stations to assign personnel to register opium smokers within their jurisdictions. Health Bureau Chief Li Ting'an has ordered the vigorous expansion of opium treatment centers to accommodate as many opium smokers as possible for treatment. However, the existing Longhua Opium Treatment Center and the Nanshi Municipal Public Hospital are inadequate due to the limited number of beds. Therefore, opium treatment hospitals will be established in Zhabei, Western Shanghai, and Pudong within the shortest possible time. Plans call for the hospitals to provide as many beds as possible to force opium smokers to enter for treatment. It is said that the establishment of these opium treatment hospitals is currently in the fundraising stage and will be implemented soon.</p>
<h3>The National Goods Alliance Suggests Controlling Industry; will Submit Detailed Plans to the Ministry for Approval and Request Expedited Loans from the Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>The National Goods Promotion Alliance Committee of this city held a standing committee meeting at its headquarters at 3 p.m. yesterday. More than ten people attended, including Gu Xiyuan, Hu Xiyuan, Lu Guozhuang, Zhang Zilian, Jiang Zhonghe, Ma Jisheng, Cheng Shouchong, Wang Xingyi, Chen Yiting, and Lu Zhixue. The meeting was chaired by Lu Zhixue. It was reported that in recent years, various light industries in our country have seemed to progress rapidly on the surface, but in reality, the unrestricted establishment of factories and the production of shoddy goods have caused the credit of domestic goods to decline sharply. Industrial products cannot reach perfection without sophisticated equipment and years of experimentation and research. However, it often happens that foremen or assistants of factories, who know only a little, go out and set up factories. With extremely simple equipment and extremely loose organization, they launch products on the market in just a few months, and even claim to be old brands. This is truly absurd. The inferiority of their products is imaginable, so they can only use low prices to attract customers. Society is dissatisfied with them, and this leads to a general loss of faith in domestic goods. People would rather buy foreign goods. This has a huge impact on domestic factories that produce high-quality products, and the crime of inducing Chinese people to send their money abroad is even greater. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's request that the government implement industrial control is based on this reason. Some believe that after the implementation of industrial control, the number of factories will inevitably decrease, making the unemployment problem even more serious. However, factories that produce substandard products cannot stabilize themselves, and factories that produce standard products cannot consolidate themselves due to the price disruption. Perhaps they will all perish together, making the unemployment problem even more serious. However, the workers of factories with high-quality products and more developed businesses will naturally increase, which is better than the former situation. As a large group of domestic factories, the alliance should submit a presentation stating the urgency and necessity of industrial control while the government is still hesitant about the industrial control issue, and request that it be put on the agenda for implementation as soon as possible. As for the detailed rules for industrial control, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has already drafted them in detail and submitted them to the government. The alliance should have its own proposals, and at the same time report the progress of the loan application. As a result of the discussion, (1) It was resolved to submit a request to the Ministry of Finance for a quick loan to industrial and commercial businesses to save them from their plight. (2) It was resolved that the entire plan for industrial control should be reported to the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry should adopt and approve it in accordance with the Ministry of Industry's approval.</p>

After staying in Shanghai for a short time, he will return to Beijing to complete the transfer of the Supreme Court.</p>
<h3>Requests for Disaster Relief for Flood-Stricken Provinces</h3>
<p>Communications Received from the Red Swastika Society</p>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, mountain floods have erupted in various places. Hubei, Jiangxi, and other provinces have already suffered disasters in succession. The counties of Fancheng, Tianmen, and Gucheng are especially devastated. In recent days, the Yellow River has also breached its banks, and the provinces of Shandong and Hebei have suffered renewed catastrophes. The Joint Office of the Southeast Branches of the Red Swastika Society in this city has successively received requests for disaster relief from the Red Swastika Societies in Hubei, Shandong, and other provinces. These are recorded below. (1) Telegram from the Jiangxi Provincial Disaster Relief Committee: Raise funds for the drought relief associations of various provinces. Red Swastika Society General Office. Hua Yang Righteous Disaster Relief General Association, please note. En Wei two telegrams, all seen and considered. Jiangxi Province has suffered both banditry and frequent droughts and floods. Without urgent relief, the lives of the people will be difficult to sustain. In addition to the previous report to your association of 13 counties affected by floods, for a total of 24 counties in three reports, we now additionally report Wuyuan, Leping, Fengxin, Dongxiang, Pengze, Yiyang, Yujiang, Duchang, Guangfeng, Guixi, Qianshan, and other twelve counties reporting flood disasters. The situation is especially severe. It is observed that this major flood is causing disasters, and the rising water exceeds all previous records. In some places, the water level has risen by more than 18 feet in a single night. Currently, the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake are both experiencing floods, advancing simultaneously. The inland areas are flooded, and there is no way to drain the water. Many embankments have been submerged and breached. Even those that have survived are in constant fear. The displaced people have left their homes and live in the mountains, lacking food. Cries for help shake the mountains, and telegrams of urgency are like stars in the sky. If urgent relief is not provided, they may resort to desperate measures, which is a cause for concern. This committee lacks the resources to provide aid and has no magic touch. We cannot bear to ignore their plight, but we are also unable to help with our bare hands. In this time of dire need, we can only send another telegram to plead for the people's lives. We humbly request that you consider the extraordinary severity of the disaster in Jiangxi and immediately provide charitable assistance to save the lives of the people. The entire population is eagerly awaiting your benevolent response. Jiangxi Provincial Disaster Relief Committee Chairman Lu Xianjia (seal). (1) Telegram from the Wuhan Office: The embankments in the various counties of Hubei have been breached one after another, causing losses to crops and drowning people. The severity of the disaster and the extent of the affected area are even greater than in the year of Xinwei [1931]. More than 30 large ships have been dispatched to Hankou to handle emergency relief nearby. We earnestly request that you quickly raise funds for assistance. We respectfully plead for the lives of the people in more than 20 counties. (1) Telegram from the Yichang Red Swastika Society: Yichang has been experiencing continuous rain for four days and nights. Floods converge, and the water depth in the plains is more than ten feet. Crops and houses have been swept away by the flood. Countless people and livestock have died. The situation is extremely tragic. We have organized rescue teams together with people from all walks of life to provide rescue and relief. What is especially tragic is that in the Xiaoxita area, more than 400 households were washed away by the water in one night, leaving only about 20 households. More than 500 people died. In total, more than 20,000 people in this city have been affected by the disaster, without clothing or food. We urgently request that funds be allocated for relief. (1) Telegram from the Jiujiang Red Swastika Society: The Yangtze River is overflowing. The counties of Tianmen and Gucheng in Hubei Province have been completely submerged. The bodies of people and livestock are floating down the river past Xun. Our society has formed teams to retrieve and bury the bodies. Please inform the branches in Qing, Tong, Wu, and Jing to pay attention in their respective areas to prevent epidemics. Jiujiang Branch, Qia. (1) Telegram from Fancheng: On the night of July 6th, Fancheng experienced torrential rain. By the morning of the 7th, the Xiang River had risen violently by more than ten feet. The houses in the city were submerged, and even the higher places were blocked by the flood. Thousands of people were drowned, and half of the houses collapsed. Outside the city, there was a vast expanse of water, and the number of dead was even greater. The heartbreaking and tragic scene cannot be described by any words in the dictionary. By the morning of the 10th, the water level had receded slightly, and the city was filled with cries of mourning, even more tragic than before. The dead cannot be buried, and the living, whether rich or poor, are all crying out for food. Local government agencies and gentry have formed a flood relief committee to provide temporary relief to the victims. However, the flood was so fierce that the water rose by more than six feet in an hour, making it impossible to escape in time. Goods and food were all submerged by the water. This is an unprecedented catastrophe. The victims are on the verge of death, desperately hoping for relief. In addition, Fancheng's commerce has collapsed in recent years and is no longer a city. How can they survive this great hardship? We urgently report the situation and earnestly plead for immediate relief to save the lives of the people. Your great kindness and virtue will be forever remembered. Fancheng City Flood Relief Committee (seal). (1) Telegram from the Jinan Red Swastika Society: The Zhencheng River has breached its banks, and the water is flowing southeast, causing severe disasters in Heze, Yuncheng, Juye, Dongping, Jiaxiang, and other counties. The flood season is still ongoing, and it is difficult to block the breach. The Jinan Society has sent a rescue team to Zhencheng to handle emergency relief. However, the disaster is widespread, and funds are lacking. We deeply hope that all branches will quickly raise funds and send personnel to provide emergency relief. Jinan Swastika Society, Pu.</p>
<p>It is reported that after receiving the telegrams, the organization sent the tragic details of the floods in Hubei and Shandong to various branches in the southeast, calling for a joint effort to raise funds for relief. Telegrams were also sent to the branches in Jing, Wu, Tong, and Qing to quickly form rescue teams to retrieve and bury floating corpses along the river to prevent epidemics.</p>
<p>Guangdong Organizations Remit Funds for Disaster Relief</p>
<p>The Gao Ming Association of Guangzhou, due to the sudden rise of the Xijiang River and the extremely tragic situation, urgently requested relief and telegraphed the Guang Zhao Association to request compassion and immediate relief to save the people affected by the disaster. Yesterday, the Guang Zhao Association and the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Business Federation jointly remitted 3,000 yuan to provide disaster relief.</p>
<p>Hubei Association Receives Telegram from Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Shanghai Hubei Fellow Association yesterday received a telegram from the Hankou Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Hubei Provincial Federation of Commerce, which read, "To all charitable organizations, we respectfully inform you that during this year's summer flood season, continuous rain has caused endless flooding. Recently, the Han River and the Yangtze River have risen simultaneously, and the embankments along the banks have been breached. In particular, Fancheng and Xiangyang in the upper reaches of the Han River have been completely submerged, with water reaching ten feet high, and the people have become fish. Han, Mian, Tian, and Qian have been submerged in a vast expanse of water. The rapid currents have swept away residents who could not escape in time, drowning hundreds of thousands of people. Corpses are floating everywhere, a sight that is unbearable to witness and a tragedy that is unbearable to hear. Wuhan is located at the confluence of the two rivers, and the situation is precarious. The existing embankments are all in danger of collapsing and are being reinforced day and night. Even if they can be preserved, it will only be a small area that is unharmed, while the disaster is even more severe than twenty years ago. Those affected by the disaster are struggling to provide relief and are in dire need of assistance. We earnestly ask that you consider the previous circumstances and show great compassion, either by allocating public funds to provide emergency relief or by donating from your private wealth to help the survivors. We appeal for benevolent governance and call out in unison. The telegram is urgent and expresses our deep concern. Hankou Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Hubei Provincial Federation of Commerce, together respectfully plead." Xiao.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications to Reorganize Navigation Administration; Director Gao to Draft Plan</h3>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reports that the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, in view of the decline of the shipping industry, resolved at a general meeting of members to request the government to allocate 10 million yuan in shipping industry bonds for relief. It also decided to implement self-restraint and to cooperate to prevent competition among companies. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, San Bei Steam Navigation Company, Ning Shao Steam Navigation Company, Butterfield &amp; Swire, Jardine Matheson, Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, and six other companies have reached a concrete agreement on cooperation on the Yangtze River route, which will soon be implemented. The reorganization of other shipping routes is also in progress. The Ministry of Communications, in order to reorganize the national navigation administration, has instructed Gao Tingzi, Director of the Navigation Administration Department, to draft a reorganization plan. It has also instructed the Shipping Industry Association to maintain the status quo on all routes before the plan is promulgated. It has ordered the Maoli wheel of the Maoli Steamship Bureau and the Hongxing wheel of the Daxing Company to temporarily suspend operations. Requests to the Shanghai Navigation Bureau for permission to open new routes have reportedly been referred to the Ministry of Communications.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo Route: Recent Decline in Shipping Industry</h3>
<p>Since the four companies operating on the Ningbo route began cooperating and sharing profits, business has improved considerably. In recent years, it has been difficult to make profits on various routes along the coast and the Yangtze River. However, the four companies operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, such as Xin Jiang Tian, Xin Ning Shao, Ning Xing, and Xin Beijing, have all had annual surpluses. Even the Xin Hong Xing wheel of the Daxing Company has been profitable. However, in the last month or two, the shipping industry on this route has also been affected by the sluggish market and the lack of purchasing power among the people. Exports have plummeted, and freight revenue has fallen sharply. The companies initially thought it was a fluke, but recently it has been happening on every voyage. The Ningbo wheels traveling from Shanghai to Ningbo are earning an average of 300 yuan for freight, and in some cases only 200 yuan, which is only one-tenth of the normal amount. Inbound freight to Shanghai, apart from a small amount of cotton, is also lacking. Import freight rates have also fallen drastically. According to people in the companies, the decline in business on the Shanghai-Ningbo route is unprecedented since the founding of the Republic. They also said that frequent natural disasters and rural bankruptcy mean there is little hope for recovery. This is a great misfortune for the shipping industry.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Newly Purchased Seagoing Vessel Named Haiyun (Sea Cloud), Operating to Lianyungang Because It Is a Seagoing Vessel</h3>
<p>The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company purchased the seagoing vessel Dafei from France. It was initially purchased under the name of Liu Hongsheng, so it was temporarily renamed Hongyuan. After arriving in Shanghai, it entered the Jiangnan Shipyard for inspection and repairs. The company has now completed the acceptance and decided to send it to Lianyungang (Old Wharf) to transport cargo for combined transport, in order to avoid renting ships from other companies and spending more than 100,000 yuan per year on rent, thus reducing unnecessary expenses. The chief captain of the company's ship department discussed the renaming of the ship with General Manager Liu. As a result of the discussion, it was decided to name it Haiyun (Sea Cloud) because it is operating to Lianyungang and is also a seagoing vessel. The captain and crew are also being considered. The company is also reporting to the Ministry of Communications, the Navigation Administration Bureau, and the Jianghai Customs to request registration and the issuance of a sailing license. It will then be deployed to the Shanghai-Lianyungang route as a regular service after the repairs are completed.</p>
<h3>Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to Launch Tung Oil Loan Program; Zhejiang Construction Department to Send Personnel to Shanghai for Negotiations; General Bureau of Savings and Remittance Has Agreed to Allocate 100,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The China News Agency reports that the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department has stated that the Jinquchu areas of eastern Zhejiang are rich in tung oil, and the amount of oil produced and sold abroad each year is not small. Tung oil is a major export product. In order to relieve the farmers' economic hardship and improve production methods, in addition to ordering the counties that produce tung oil to organize cooperatives, it is also negotiating with the financial community to borrow large sums of money to launch a seedling loan program to provide farmers with capital to expand planting and fertilization. However, the counties that produce tung oil are located in remote areas, and most of them do not have financial institutions to handle the tung oil seedling loan program, which makes it very difficult. The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau is planning to allocate funds to launch a rural loan program in order to promote the prosperity of the rural areas of Zhejiang Province, which may provide an opportunity for cooperative management. The department has specially sent Chen Zhongming, director of the Cooperative Management Office of the Agricultural Management Committee, from Hangzhou to Shanghai to negotiate cooperative arrangements with the person in charge of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau. The results of the meeting were very satisfactory. The General Bureau of Savings and Remittance has agreed to allocate 100,000 yuan for the tung oil seedling loan program in Zhejiang Province, and the amount of loans will be distributed according to the amount of tung oil produced in each county. After further consultation, the contract can be formally signed. In order to actively proceed with the plan, the Construction Department has ordered the counties that produce tung oil to formulate loan plans and improvement plans. Currently, four or five counties have submitted their plans in compliance with the order. The Construction Department will determine the loan method after all the county plans have been submitted and will then transfer the loans to the farmers through the cooperatives.</p>
<h3>Xu Shiying and Others Continue to Send Telegrams, Reporting on Their Inspection of the Disaster Area; Anhui Inspection Completed, Arriving in Jiangxi Tonight</h3>
<p>Xu Shiying, Chairman of the National Government Relief Committee, led a group including Relief Committee Secretary Huang Bodu, Hu Mai, Section Chief Zhou Kui, and his son, on the Jiang'an wheel westward to Jiangxi on the 16th. They arrived in Anhui Province on the 17th, passed Wuhu in the evening, and passed Anqing on the morning of the 18th. Anhui Chairman Liu Zhenhua has met with Xu, and it is reported that the Anhui Provincial Government will form its own relief association for the relief efforts in Anhui Province, which the Relief Committee will assist. Xu sent a telegram to Shanghai on the morning of the 18th, stating that he would arrive in Jiujiang, Jiangxi, at 7 p.m. on the 19th and would pass through Hubei Province and arrive in Hankou in the afternoon, and then travel to Changsha by the Yuehan Railway's Hunan-Hubei section.</p>
<h3>No Genuine Cases of Cholera Have Occurred in This City</h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau issued a statement yesterday stating that the news report in the newspapers yesterday (the 18th) that two genuine cases of cholera had been discovered at the Hongkou Epidemic Hospital had attracted the attention of the Municipal Health Bureau. The bureau immediately sent personnel to the hospital to investigate. According to the hospital director, Wang Boyuan, no genuine cases of cholera had been discovered. However, two patients with vomiting had come to the hospital for treatment. Yesterday, a reporter from a news agency called to inquire whether any cholera patients had been discovered. The hospital staff informed the reporter that two patients had come to the hospital for treatment. The reporter mistakenly assumed that these two patients were cholera patients and issued the erroneous news report. The hospital will request a correction to avoid misrepresentation. The Municipal Health Bureau has strictly instructed the hospital to inform its staff that they should not casually release information about illnesses without scientific verification to avoid misleading the public.</p>
<p>According to yesterday's report, the draft was adopted from the East China News Agency. The correction letter is now compiled as follows:</p>
<p>Wu Liande wrote: Sir, I have read in today's newspaper that genuine cases of cholera have been discovered in the city. Our office attaches great importance to this matter. We have inquired with Dr. Lin Chunshan, the medical director of the Hongkou Epidemic Hospital, who stated that this is not the case. We request that you take steps to correct this information immediately. We have always admired your newspaper as a leader of public opinion. In the future, if you have any news about cholera, please inform our office first by telegram, and we will be happy to provide a sincere response. If the information is false, please do not publish it to avoid misleading the public. This letter is sent to you for your information and handling. Sincerely, Wu Liande, Chairman of the Shanghai Temporary Office for the Prevention of Cholera, July 18.</p>
<p>The Hongkou Epidemic Hospital wrote: Sir, we were shocked to read in the local news section of your newspaper on the 18th of this month that a genuine case of cholera had been discovered in the city. The number of people examined at our hospital as of yesterday was 1,226, not 452, and there were no cases of Lin Shixin or Li Chen's family suffering from genuine cholera. Moreover, the hospital's medical affairs are managed by Drs. Lin Chunshan and Zhu Xiaofang, and there is no director named Wang Boyuan. In addition, if a patient suffers from genuine cholera, it is impossible for them to be cured in the afternoon after being admitted to the hospital in the morning. It is clear that someone is spreading rumors with ulterior motives. This matter concerns the peace and security of the entire city, and it is urgent to clarify the truth. In addition to reporting this matter to the Municipal Health Bureau for investigation, we are sending this special letter to request a correction to clarify the facts. Sincerely, Hongkou Epidemic Hospital, July 18.</p>

It states that the Regulations for the Presentation and Inspection of Ship Entry and Exit Documents were issued on September 19, 1934, under Notice No. 1384.

<h3>Ministry of Industry to Revise Factory Registration Regulations; Unregistered Factories to Complete Procedures Within Six Months</h3>
<p>The Shih She News Agency reports that the Factory Registration Regulations were formulated by the Ministry of Industry and promulgated for implementation in December 1931. However, the number of factories that have registered according to law is still small. It is now reported that the Ministry of Industry, in order to vigorously implement this work, has specially revised and published the original regulations and formulated a factory registration certificate form, ordering the Construction Department of each province and the Social Bureau of each city to comply. The revised registration regulations stipulate that all factories owned by Chinese citizens that regularly employ 30 or more workers or use mechanical power for manufacturing shall complete registration within six months of the promulgation of these regulations. Those who fail to register after the deadline may be punished in accordance with the Administrative Execution Law and ordered to complete registration. New factories that fail to apply for registration within two months will not be heard. After receiving the document, the Social Bureau of this city has formulated various forms and certificates in accordance with the law and issued them to various factories for registration. As the factory sites are located in busy urban areas, the noise and smoke generated often arouse the opposition of the general public. In order to protect industry, maintain social order, and take both sides into account, a separate Notification on the Management of Factory Site Addresses has been formulated and implemented last year. Existing factories are required to apply for permits within a prescribed period, and new factories must apply to the Social Bureau for approval before starting construction.</p>

<h3>Interview with Telegraph Bureau Director Bao Keyong on the Communication Status in Flood-Stricken Areas; Wired Telegraph Slightly Affected, Wireless Telegraph Reporting Normally</h3>
<p>In recent days, the river water has risen violently in various places along the Yangtze River, and wired telegraphs have been reported to be obstructed due to the collapse of telegraph poles. A reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Mr. Bao Keyong, director of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, to inquire about the communication status in the flood-stricken areas. According to Mr. Bao, the volume of telegrams in Wuhan and Jiujiang is usually quite high. Although it is still possible to communicate during the floods, the time delay has become a problem. Shashi is also experiencing similar difficulties, but since the volume of telegrams is low, there is no significant impact. Wuhan and Jiujiang have always communicated directly, but now they have to detour through Zhengzhou, which also causes delays. As for wireless telegraphs, they are still reporting normally, even in the flood-stricken areas, and are not affected at all. However, due to the obstruction of wired telegraphs, the volume of telegrams has become quite congested.</p>

<h3>Lawyers Association Admonishes Lawyers to Compete in Self-Reflection and Mutual Improvement</h3>
<p>The Republic of China Lawyers Association issued a notice to lawyers' associations in various provinces, stating: This is for the purpose of notification. The lawyer system, in modern civilized countries, has a duty to utilize the law to eliminate the contradictions accumulated in human real life, or to resolve the obvious struggles in human real life. In other words, it is to integrate people's real life with the law, thereby forming a path of common compliance and establishing a foundation of social trust. However, those who are not fully educated, have questionable conduct, tarnish the reputation, and are criticized by the world, also exist. This is undeniable. The Association looks outward and feels anxious. It believes that lawyers in our country today should be loyal servants who love and protect the law, and vanguards who protect human rights. The responsibilities are so solemn. However, due to a small number of colleagues who have disgraced their duties and tarnished their reputation, giving people reasons for criticism, and damaging the entire profession, every time it is thought of, it is with great regret. Recently, judicial officials have admonished legal professionals with extreme severity, and the earnestness of rectification overflows from their words. Our lawyers are one of the three major judicial professions. How can we not feel ashamed? Despite the many shortcomings of this writing, in order to uphold the principles of self-respect and autonomy, it offers advice that is unpleasant to the ear but beneficial to practice. It is hoped that all members of our associations, from now on, will break through considerations of personal relationships, seriously investigate all members, and strive to compete in self-reflection and mutual improvement, thinking about how to establish a model for the future and how to wash away the stains of the past, being vigilant against selfish desires for material things, and spontaneously generating a sense of justice. The impact will not only allow the legal profession to restore its inherent glory, but also benefit the people and the country.</p>

<h3>Before the Xinwei Relief Society, a Large Number of Refugees Seek Boat Tickets; the Society Declines Due to Financial Reasons</h3>
<p>Shanghai's economy is depressed, factories are closed, workers are unemployed, and the number of people from disaster areas in various provinces coming to Shanghai to make a living is increasing daily. Therefore, making a living is difficult, and drifting at sea is pitiful. Yesterday afternoon around 3:00 PM, more than two hundred refugees gathered at the entrance of the Renji Hall on Yunnan Road. They were repeatedly dispersed, but they returned again and again, pleading with the Xinwei Relief Society to issue free boat tickets. However, the Society, due to the large number of vagrants in the area who seize the opportunity to mix among them, obtain boat tickets, and then sell them, while genuine refugees are unable to obtain relief, and also because of limited finances, had already issued a notice to stop issuing free tickets. It was unable to meet the demands of the refugees. Unexpectedly, the refugees were numerous and noisy and refused to leave, waiting at the door until 8:00 PM before dispersing reluctantly.</p>
<h3>Cai Fei, Seeking a Magic Cure, Suddenly Hit by a Stray Bullet</h3>
<p>Cai Ronggen, 35 years old, a local resident of No. 35, opposite the Nanxin Bridge Cement Factory on Longhua Road, Nanshi, his wife, Cai Fei, 30 years old, from Longhua, because their son was ill, Cai's wife Fei, accompanied by a woman named Cai Linzhen, went to Longhua Temple to offer incense and seek a magic cure for their son's illness. Therefore, around 9:00 AM yesterday, while walking through the intersection of Xiaomu Bridge Road on Longhua Road, suddenly a stray bullet flew over and hit Cai Fei's left lower abdomen. She immediately fell to the ground in extreme pain. Her companion, Cai Linzhen, reported the incident to the Second Defense Office of the nearby Security Corps, but they refused to accept the case, instructing her to report to the Public Security Bureau for handling. Subsequently, the woman hired a rickshaw and sent the injured Cai Fei to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. Because the hospital examined Fei's abdomen for bullets, but no family members were at the hospital to take responsibility, the bullets could not be removed. Fortunately, she was still conscious and there was probably no danger to her life. The incident was learned by the Ximen Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, which immediately dispatched a detective team led by Squad Leader Shen Wenda, Foremen Fang Lin, and detectives Bian Wenguang to investigate. They investigated where the bullet came from and injured the person, and also investigated nearby military and police units, but there was no live ammunition target practice. Director Li still ordered detectives to investigate for verification and ordered Shanghai Hospital to find a way to quickly remove the bullet from the woman's abdomen to save her life.</p>
<h3>French Concession Establishes Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Branch, Clinic Already Open</h3>
<p>The National News Agency reporter made a special trip to the newly established Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Branch on Beile Road in the French Concession of this port. An official of the Association, Mr. Yan, led a visit to the various departments: the Rickshaw Pullers Clinic, Dispensing Room, Classroom, Storytelling Room, Broadcasting Room, Bathroom, Dormitory, etc. Currently, due to the hot weather, the clinic is already open. Other parts are still under internal renovation, and will be implemented step by step after the work is completed. It is said that the Association headquarters shows educational films every Sunday to improve the knowledge of rickshaw pullers.</p>
<h3>French Concession Wood Industry Opposes Sanitation Tax, Writes to Various Groups Seeking Abolition</h3>
<p>There are forty to fifty wood businesses in the French Concession of this port. Two years ago, the French Concession Public Works Bureau notified the wood businesses to donate for a classified business sanitation license. The wood businesses, having been established for many years without this sanitation tax, could not accept it and unanimously expressed opposition. They jointly wrote to the Fourth District Branch of the Second Special District Citizens Association of this city, asking them to forward it to the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the French Concession to argue with the Public Works Bureau, and the result was that the donation license was waived. Unexpectedly, this month, the wood businesses suddenly received a written notice from the Classified Business Office of the French Public Works Bureau stating that from now on, they should donate a classified business license to the bureau and pay an examination fee of two or ten yuan. Upon receiving the notice, the wood businesses were panicked and said that they had firmly opposed the extra donation by the bureau two years ago, and they had already negotiated its cancellation. Moreover, at a time when the market is depressed and industries are declining, they were really unable to bear it. They jointly wrote to the Second Special District Citizens Association, the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association, and the trade association of this city yesterday, requesting that they make a strong case. At the same time, they are also starting to organize a temporary office for the wood industry trade association of the French Concession, in order to unite and fight to the end.</p>
<h3>Overview of the Public Concession's Suppression of Narcotics</h3>
<p>According to the report of the Public Concession Police Department for June, the patrol unit continued to seriously suppress opium and narcotics within the concession. A total of eleven reports of searches were obtained by the Central Police Station, and forty-one opium offenders were arrested. A total of one hundred and ten cases were searched by various police stations, and three hundred and forty-one offenders were arrested. A total of one hundred and twenty-nine opium offenders were sentenced to imprisonment, of which forty-five were also fined. A total of one hundred and eighty-nine were only fined.

The total amount of fines paid by various opium offenders this month was 14,830 yuan and 20 Japanese yen.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Crime Statistics for June</h3>
<p>According to the report of the Acting Chief Superintendent of the Public Concession Police Department for June, a total of 1,240 crime cases were reported this month, a decrease of 193 cases compared to May, but an increase of 124 cases compared to the same month last year. The main reason for the increase is the large number of petty theft cases. If we consider the number of criminals arrested, there were only 1,252 people this month, which is not a decrease compared to April and May. In addition, there were 144 people who committed crimes in previous months but were only arrested in June, and 67 people were arrested on behalf of other local authorities. If we classify the crimes by type, there were 24 cases of armed robbery, 25 cases of burglary, 23 cases of home robbery, and 19 cases of shop robbery (18 arrests), 72 cases of petty theft (59 arrests), 6 cases of receiving stolen goods, and 49 cases of snatching. The vehicles reported stolen included two cars and 49 bicycles. Two cars and 17 bicycles were recovered. The total value of stolen property reported this month was over 150,070 yuan. The total value of stolen property reported last month was only slightly less than 72,000 yuan. The reason for the increase this month is that one case involved the embezzlement and misuse of over 65,000 yuan of public funds. The total value of recovered property this month was over 27,000 yuan. In June, 20 men and 15 women reported suicides to the police. Four communist criminals were arrested this month, one was released on bail, and the remaining 30 were still in custody. A total of 1,268 communist books were seized. Furthermore, there were two factory strikes in the Public Concession in June, affecting a total of 1,514 workers. The time lost due to work stoppages totaled 32,592 days.</p>
<h3>Ye Jiaxing and Others Suggest Transferring Ritual Funds to Disaster Relief, Yesterday Sent Letters to Various Groups for Submission to the Central Government</h3>
<p>Ye Jiaxing, a member of the Commercial Research Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Ye Ping, a secretary of the Social Affairs Bureau, in view of the extreme severity of floods in various places and the widespread misery, yesterday sent letters to various groups in this city, requesting that they be submitted to the Central Government, ordering all provinces and cities across the country to transfer the funds for folk rituals to disaster relief, so as to achieve real benefits. The original letter stated: "We are writing to you because since the beginning of summer this year, floods have caused disasters in various places, mountain floods have broken out, and rivers have overflowed. In addition, continuous rain has caused water levels to increase sharply. The provinces of Shandong, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi have all suffered great calamities. Bridges have been washed away, dams have collapsed, autumn crops have been submerged, and houses have been swept away. Wherever the floods have reached, nothing has been left behind. Hundreds of counties, large and small, have become swamps. The area of the disaster area is estimated to be over one million square li, and the number of compatriots affected has reached twenty to thirty million. Misery is everywhere, and they are crying for food. The severity of the disaster is almost the same as that in the 20th year of the Republic of China. Now, the authorities in various provinces are urgently providing relief, or engaging in rescue operations, or allocating relief funds. Even if it is a drop in the bucket, it can save one in a thousand or a hundred. However, recently, it has been reported that superstitious people in the interior are even collecting money to perform rituals to pray for disaster relief. To waste useful money on useless purposes is a great waste of money and labor. Considering that when the flood disaster was extremely severe in the 20th year of the Republic of China, there were no rituals performed in various places, and now the disaster has reappeared, it is clear that they are of no practical help. Moreover, our country today has reached the extreme of economic collapse. Every expenditure must be worth one yuan's equivalent, so that there is no waste of money and the people receive real benefits. Jiaxing and others, in view of this, hereby request that you jointly forward this to the Central Government, ordering the various provinces and cities to instruct the various county governments that if there are folk rituals that collect money, the funds should be transferred to repairing embankments, controlling water, and providing post-disaster relief in the disaster area, so that all people will benefit deeply."</p>

<h3>Wind and Rain Yesterday Morning and Evening, Heat Wave in This Port Slightly Reduced, Hailstorm for Several Minutes Around 3:00 PM, South Pacific Typhoon Now Moving Northwest</h3>
<p>The weather in this city has been hot recently, especially the previous two days. Therefore, summer epidemics have been successively discovered. Yesterday, due to wind and rain in the morning and evening, the heat wave has slightly subsided. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Morning and Evening Wind and Rain</p>
<p>The heat wave in this port has been very high recently, all around 100 degrees. The previous two days, due to the heat and sultriness, many summer epidemics were discovered. Yesterday morning around 2:00 AM, there was a rainstorm with thunder. At 5:15 AM at dawn, a strong southeast wind rose again. Therefore, the temperature before noon reached a maximum of 91.05 degrees Fahrenheit. At 2:00 PM, it rose to over 94 degrees. At 3:35 PM, the weather suddenly turned cloudy and clear, with thunder booming. Hail fell for four or five minutes, followed by showers. It stopped at 4:15 PM. A gentle breeze blew, and the weather quickly cleared. Therefore, the heat wave was less intense than the previous day.</p>
<p>Beneficial to Crops</p>
<p>Since the beginning of summer in this port, the weather has been very moderate. Although the Yangtze River flood is severe, it has not been affected in any way. Even Songjiang, Jinshan, Qingpu, Jiading, and Baoshan counties near Shanghai have neither shallow rivers nor high water levels. Therefore, irrigation for crops is very suitable. Although the heat has been high for a week, there has been a rainstorm every day. According to farmers, the climate during this summer is very beneficial to agricultural products.</p>
<p>Boatman Killed by Lightning</p>
<p>In the past two days, the weather has been extremely hot and abnormal. The thermometer reading is often above 100 degrees, and showers fall from time to time. Yesterday (the 18th) morning, the weather was still sultry. Around 4:00 PM, the weather suddenly changed, with dark clouds gathering, lightning flashing, thunder rumbling, and heavy rain pouring. Suddenly, a thunderclap struck. There were six boatmen inside a lighter docked at Dongjiabo Litu in the south of Shanghai, all sheltering from the rain in the cabin. Upon hearing the sound of thunder, they all fainted in shock. After a while, the boatmen woke up and checked the number of people. Only five people were left. One of them, a certain person, was missing. While they were wondering, they suddenly heard a commotion on the shore. The boatmen went ashore to check and found that a certain person had been struck to death at the north side of the Dongjiabo pier, kneeling on both feet, shirtless, with the skin on his chest scorched by lightning, his hair also burnt and curled, and his cloth pants unburnt. His head was burnt and his face was swollen, and his death was terrible. For a while, the onlookers blocked the road.</p>
<h3>High Tide in This City This Morning, Yesterday's Tide Exceeded Forecast</h3>
<p>A high tide was detected in this city starting at 2:05 AM this morning. Due to the northeast wind last night, the height may exceed the 11 feet 7 inches record forecast by the Whangpoo Conservancy Board. At 1:50 AM yesterday morning, the Whangpoo Bureau water level record (Suzhou Creek Estuary) had reached 11 feet 2.2 inches, 8 inches higher than the forecast of 11 feet 6.2 inches. At 2:00 PM, it had exceeded 12 feet. Last night, the night tide began at 11:35 PM, and the peak was at 1:21 AM this morning. The highest tide was at 1:26 AM. This morning, the highest tide started to rise at 12:19 AM, and the rush was from 1:20 AM to the highest tide at 2:05 AM. Since it coincided with the collision of incoming and outgoing tides, the rise will exceed the forecast.</p>
<h3>The Hurricane in the South Pacific is Still Advancing, Whether it Will Hit Shanghai is Still Unknown, Hurricane Center Reaches 120 Nautical Miles</h3>
<p>The hurricane discovered in the South Pacific is now moving northwest. According to the report from the observatory yesterday morning, the hurricane has now blown to 126 degrees east longitude and 19 degrees north latitude, approximately northeast of Luzon. The center of the wind force is 120 nautical miles, so the wind is very strong. The direction is northwest. Whether it will hit Shanghai is still uncertain because it is far from Shanghai. The hurricane is moving fast. The morning before yesterday, it was still hovering between 130 degrees east longitude and 3 degrees north latitude. In one day, the difference in latitude and longitude reached five or six degrees.</p>
<h3>Three Died of Heatstroke, Court Separately Investigated</h3>
<p>Recently, the weather has been hot and the heat has been oppressive. The day before yesterday, three men and women in the Public Concession died of heatstroke on the way. The police stations in charge sent detectives to transport the bodies to the Feilun Road morgue for investigation.

<h3>Ministry of Finance Sets Reporting Measures to Reward Seizure of Smuggling, Strictly Prevent Smuggling and Tax Evasion by奸商, Rewards for Customs Officers and Informants After Seizure</h3>
<p>In order to prevent the奸商 from evading taxes and smuggling, the Ministry of Finance has formulated four measures for issuing bonuses for seizing smuggling ships, and has notified the customs to know. The measures are as follows: (1) Whenever the customs seizes a smuggling vessel in operation, or seizes smuggling civilian ships, sailing ships, sampans, etc., when the customs dismantles them, it should follow the current profit-sharing method, and auction the ship. Half of the value that can be obtained (up to a limit of 1,000 yuan), or the total number of dismantled parts that can be converted into money, whichever is higher. As for informant bonuses, they can only be calculated based on the total number of separately converted parts. (2) Whenever the customs seizes a smuggling vessel operated by machine, with a registered tonnage of less than 100 tons, or seizes smuggling civilian ships, sailing ships, sampans, etc., when the customs converts them for use as patrol boats, the customs should purchase them at half of the value that can be obtained from the auction of the ship (up to a limit of 1,000 yuan). The bonuses for the officers and informants will be calculated according to the purchase price. (3) Whenever the customs, after reporting to the Inspector General of Customs and verifying it, disposes of it in other ways (such as selling it to government agencies, etc.), the amount of bonuses issued to customs officers and informants shall be determined by the Inspector General of Customs. (4) Whenever the customs seizes a smuggling vessel operated by machine, with a registered tonnage of 100 tons or more, and the customs converts it for use as a patrol boat, or sells it with the approval of the Inspector General of Customs, the price at which the customs purchases the ship, and the amount of bonuses for customs officers and informants, shall be determined by the Inspector General of Customs.</p>

<h3>Second Special Court - Prison Riot Erupts - Bowls and Chamber Pots Thrown Everywhere - Offenders Sent to Police Station for Interrogation</h3>
<p>In the heavy crime section of the detention center of the Second Special District Court, prisoners awaiting appeal for crimes such as murder and robbery suddenly started arguing over a trivial matter at 11:00 AM yesterday. The argument quickly escalated into mutual insults and physical altercations, with cries for help reaching the outside. The prisoners even threw bowls and chamber pots, leaving the prison cell and corridor littered with broken pieces of bowls and human waste. The guards on duty were unable to stop them. The detention center immediately reported the incident to the Central Police Station in Lujiawan. A large group of Chinese and foreign detectives, led by the Western Section Chief and a detective supervisor from the Police Department, arrived and quelled the disturbance after about half an hour. The prisoners involved in the riot were identified as Li Guochen (the mastermind behind a murder case in a hotel, originally sentenced to death, appealed to the Supreme Court, and sent back for retrial, recently resentenced to life imprisonment by the Third Branch of the High Court), Li Shiying (a key suspect in the assassination of Wang Bin and Cao Qingcheng, inspectors of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau of the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, originally sentenced to death, appealed to the Supreme Court, sent back for retrial, still maintaining the original sentence, currently still appealing), Tao Yongchang (a key suspect in the assassination of Cao Adi, originally sentenced to 15 years in prison, recently extorted money from Wang Xinggao, a fellow prisoner, prosecuted by the Police Department and sentenced to another six months in prison, both cases are currently on appeal), Wang Deyu (killed his cousin Ding Fugen in an attempt to seize property, originally sentenced to death, currently appealing to the Supreme Court, recently acquitted in the extortion case against Wang Xinggao), and Lu Bujiang, Chen Dekuan, Chen Yonggui, Liu Quansheng, and Jin Changfa, who were involved in robbery, theft, and drug-related cases. The nine prisoners were taken to the police station for interrogation. When the prisoners were brought out, Li Guocheng and Wang Deyu were bleeding from head wounds caused by the beating. They were supported by police officers and bailiffs, appearing to be severely injured. It is rumored that the cause of the riot was that Li Guocheng, while in detention, wanted the other prisoners to acknowledge him as the "old boss" and extorted 30 yuan in "protection money." The prisoners refused to obey, leading to the argument and fighting. The veracity of this account remains to be verified.</p>
<h3>Monk Commits Suicide by Drowning - Eight Pawn Tickets Found Nearby</h3>
<p>The body of a monk who committed suicide by drowning was discovered off the coast of Baotai in Wusong the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the Wusong Life Saving Bureau's patrol boat recovered the body. The monk, wearing a cotton robe, appeared to be around 50 years old and a traveling monk from elsewhere.

<h3>Xinhua Bank Robbery Verdict - Wang Zhitin Sentenced to Eight Years, Zhu Paoyan Fined 300</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 4th of last month, at about 10 a.m., three robbers armed with weapons broke into the Xinhua Bank branch on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. They stole 4,766.70 yuan in cash and fled. They opened fire in the Hehe Lane to resist arrest, killing a female servant and wounding Xue Guoxun, a gatekeeper of the lane. They fled to Chongqing Road in the International Settlement and killed a passerby. As a result, one of the robbers, Wang Zhitin from Anhui, 20 years old, was arrested at number 27, Ma'an Lane, Chongqing Road. A pistol was found on him and taken to the French Police Station. It was discovered that the pistol belonged to Zhu Paoyan, a native of Ningbo, who lived at number 31, Continental Apartments, Rue Luban, and was the general secretary of the Yi Minghua Bank. Zhu was arrested and the case was transferred to the Second Special District Court. The Police Department lawyer prosecuted Wang for robbery and murder and Zhu for violating the regulations on the prohibition of military firearms.

<h3>Police Request Ban on Publication of "New Life Weekly" - Petition to Court to Issue Ban Expected to be Decided Today</h3>
<p>Because "New Life Weekly" published an article titled "Chatting About the Emperor," which contained slander against the Emperor of Japan, Zheng Yue, the Chief Prosecutor of the First Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, filed a public prosecution against Du Chongyuan, the editor and publisher of the journal. The Criminal Court of the court ruled that Du be sentenced to one year and two months in prison, and he has already been sent to prison. It has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper that the legal department of the Municipal Council, although the magazine had been banned from selling, there was no explicit ban on publication. Therefore, yesterday morning, the police lawyer Ru Baoyi filed a petition with the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The written application stated that the "New Life Weekly" has been ordered by the court to ban the sale of the magazine, but there is no explicit provision for prohibiting its publication. Therefore, according to Article 41, paragraph 1 of the Publishing Law, they request the court to issue an order prohibiting the publication of "New Life Weekly" in order to facilitate compliance. Judge Yu Huating, along with Judges Zhou and Xiao and Prosecutor Zhong, presided over the First Criminal Court. After the police lawyer Ru clarified the reasons for the request, Judge Yu announced that the matter would be reviewed again today.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council - Reorganization of the Orchestra - Committee Proposes Dissolution and Reorganization - Board Decides to Retain Until Next Year</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council, with the intention of saving expenses, previously discussed reorganizing the existing Municipal Council Orchestra. This matter was referred to the Music Committee for detailed review. The questions were whether the existing Municipal Council Orchestra should be reorganized to save money and whether an organization should be retained that was similar to the existing organization. The sub-committee prepared a report stating that there was a real need to seek savings in the orchestra's expenses, as the orchestra's expenses reached 278,500 yuan last year, not including the cost of renting the concert hall and office. Therefore, the Music Committee proposed disbanding the existing orchestra and forming a new orchestra. The sub-committee drafted a plan for organizing the new orchestra, suggesting that after the new orchestra was established (excluding concert hall rent), the expenses would not exceed 200,000 yuan, thus saving 78,500 yuan per year. The four points suggested by the sub-committee are briefly summarized as follows: (1) The Municipal Council should retain an orchestra of the same size as the current one, but at a lower cost. (2) The Board of Directors should automatically disband the existing orchestra. The contracts of all musicians who have received letters of appointment should be terminated immediately. Those who are temporarily employed should be given one month's notice of termination and dismissed at the same time as the musicians with letters of appointment. (3) The date of disbandment should be decided by the Board of Directors, as the issue of disbanding the orchestra may require a decision by the taxpayers at the next annual meeting. (4) After the current orchestra is disbanded, a new orchestra should be organized immediately. Salaries should be calculated according to grade and should not enjoy the various benefits enjoyed by other employees of the Municipal Council. Contracts should be limited to one year but may be renewed annually. The organizational outline includes one director, one deputy director, one military music instructor, and 44 musicians. After detailed discussion, the Music Committee unanimously agreed to disband the existing orchestra and proposed organizing a new orchestra according to the plan prepared by the sub-committee. However, the timing of the dissolution still needs careful consideration. According to the Acting Director General, the existing orchestra should be retained until April of next year, after the taxpayers' annual meeting, so that taxpayers can freely decide (1) to dissolve it completely, (2) to retain the existing orchestra, or (3) to organize a new orchestra. The Director of Finance also agreed with the Acting Director General's proposal, advocating that April 30 of the following year be set as the expiration date of the orchestra members' contracts. After repeated discussions by the members, the suggestions of the sub-committee were slightly revised and submitted to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors discussed the above proposals for a long time. According to the Board of Directors, (1) the future of the Municipal Council Orchestra should not be decided by the Board of Directors, but should be handled by the taxpayers as in the past. (2) After the taxpayers decide in the future, whether to completely disband or reorganize, the Board of Directors, in order to facilitate rapid implementation, should set the expiration date of the current musicians' contracts as close as possible to the date of the taxpayers' annual meeting. (3) May 31 of the following year seems to be an appropriate time. (4) The reorganization plan proposed by the Music Committee should be submitted to the taxpayers. Subsequently, the Board of Directors unanimously passed the following resolutions: (1) The future of the Municipal Council Orchestra should be submitted to the next taxpayers' annual meeting. (2) The Board of Directors should notify the musicians holding letters of appointment of the termination of their contracts. The musicians who are temporarily employed should be given one month's notice of termination and dismissed at the same time as the musicians holding letters of appointment. (3) The date of this dismissal is set for May 31, 1936. (4) If the taxpayers advocate retaining an orchestra of the same size as the current one, the orchestra should be organized according to the outline prepared by the sub-committee of the Music Committee. At this point, the much-debated question of the existence of the Municipal Council Orchestra has temporarily come to an end, pending the decision of the Western expatriate taxpayers' annual meeting next April.</p>

<h3>New Methods for Cooling Off on City Ferry</h3>
<p>The weather has been extremely hot these days, with people sweating profusely. The evenings are especially stifling, making it uncomfortable to stay at home. In light of this, the city ferry has been operating late-night cooling services, which have been extremely crowded with tourists. For those who have official duties and want to cool off in the evening but should not return home too late to avoid affecting their work the next day, here are two cooling off methods: (1) After work hours, at 5 or 6 PM, take the city ferry to Gaoqiao, then take a public bus directly to the beach. You can swim and bathe as you please. The bathing area has a large cafeteria with exquisite Western food, various cold drinks, and Yangzhou dim sum at very affordable prices. After dinner, rest and walk along the beach under the moonlight, feeling refreshed. Leave the beach at 5:40, take the bus to the pier, and take a special ferry back to Shanghai, arriving at the Beijing Road pier at 11 PM. (2) After finishing work, take a bath at home and have dinner at the waterfront restaurant at 7 PM. The restaurant overlooks the Huangpu River, making it extremely cool and free of mosquitoes. Linger for an hour or two, enjoying the moonlight and the shimmering waves, which add to the serenity. At 8:30, take the late-night cooling ferry to Gaoqiao or Wusong, returning to Shanghai at 12:30. Several hours of refreshing leisure will wash away all the noise and bustle.</p>

<h3>Case of Two Women Contending for Child - Still No Solution - Examination Results Indicate Both Have the Possibility of Bearing Children - The Court Must Still Investigate and Interrogate</h3>
<p>Chen Zhou, the wife of the late real estate tycoon Chen Yide, who lived at 260 Route Belles in the French Concession, was recently sued in the civil court of the Second Special District Court by Chen Yipei, Chen's concubine, who lived at 2, Jiusi Lane, Rue Puech, seeking a ruling to return her biological son, Chen Xiongguan (also known as Xiongyi). After several court hearings and summonses, because both plaintiffs claimed that Xiongguan was their own biological son, the presiding judge stated that unless scientific methods of examination were used, it would be insufficient to prove who Chen Xiongguan was born to. Therefore, he ordered both parties and Chen Xiongguan to be sent to the Zhenru Forensic Research Institute for examination to make a final decision. This has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. The Forensic Research Institute, based on the appearance, physique, and blood of the plaintiff Chen Yipei, the defendant Chen Zhou, and Chen Xiongguan, conducted a detailed examination and concluded that both Chen Yipei and Chen Zhou had the possibility of bearing Chen Xiongguan. They determined that Chen Xiongguan's age was between eight and twelve years old. They also verified that Chen Zhou had been pregnant and given birth. They have reported the details to the court. Yesterday morning, at 10:30 AM, Judge Ma reopened the civil case in the Seventh Court. The plaintiff's lawyer was present, and the defendant was represented by a lawyer. The court asked the plaintiff if they had received the appraisal report from the Forensic Research Institute and that the examination fee of 43 yuan would be borne equally by both parties and the plaintiff should pay it promptly. The court also asked if there was any other evidence to present. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that the plaintiff was in financial straits and could pay the fee within days. The lawyer also requested an investigation that the plaintiff stated the child was born in July 1926, while the defendant stated the child was born in October 1925. If the child was indeed born to the defendant, then Chen Yide should have requested registration with the Catholic Church. This is a regulation in the Catholic Church that the birth of a child must be registered with the year, month, day, and time of birth. The defendant's lawyer retorted that the burden of proof was on the plaintiff, but the plaintiff could not prove whether they had cohabited with Chen Yide, or whether they had conceived and given birth during the cohabitation period, so how could they have this child out of thin air? The plaintiff Chen Xing had died young, and if she were still alive, she would be 15 or 16 years old, definitely not the current Chen Xiongguan. The court examined the statements and then ordered that the case be investigated further and summoned again at a later date.</p>

<h3>Taxpayers' Association Appeals for Exemption from Tax Increase for "Tada" Cart Industry</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association yesterday sent a letter to the Municipal Council, which reads as follows: "Dear Sirs, We have received a letter from the Shanghai Nantong Fellow-Provincials Association stating: 'According to a letter jointly signed by our association members Feng Daoyuan and more than 200 others, the "tada" cart industry relies on manpower to transport goods for customers, working hard to make a living. Since the development of mechanical transportation and the emergence of trucks that monopolize the market, business has been declining, and the huge seasonal taxes (10 yuan per season) must be paid reluctantly. The hardships are numerous, and we are worried about freezing and starvation. Now, several industries in Shanghai are declining, and the situation is unprecedentedly bleak. Our industry is on the verge of collapse due to the sharp decline in passenger and cargo traffic. Unexpectedly, news has come that the Public Concession Municipal Council, disregarding the difficult times, has decided to increase the taxes on the "tada" cart industry by 50%. Upon hearing this, we were horrified. While it may increase the authorities' income, the increased levies will directly declare the "tada" cart industry dead and indirectly increase social concerns. After discussion, we unanimously expressed our inability to bear the tax increase and specially requested your association to consider the plight of our fellow townsmen and the hardships of the laboring class and provide assistance.' The "tada" cart industry is affected by the economic downturn and faces difficult livelihoods, which is a visible fact. Increasing taxes now will only speed up its collapse and increase the number of unemployed. According to the previous letter, we hereby request your association to consider the difficult times and the hardships of the "tada" cart industry and promptly strive to get the Public Concession Municipal Council to cancel the tax increase in order to secure their business." Representatives of the "tada" cart industry also sent a letter to the association with the same request. The tax increase on the rickshaw industry has already been brought to your attention in a letter requesting you to consider the difficult times and promptly cancel the tax increase. The previous reasons are the same, and we request you to quickly adapt to the social and economic environment and cancel the tax increase in order to secure the legitimate livelihood of the industry and avoid increasing the number of unemployed in society. This is our sincere hope."</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor, I am writing in response to the news item "Concubine Sues Widow and Son After Overseas Chinese Lin Yuting's Death" published in your newspaper on the 18th of this month. It said, "Lin Yuting's estate, worth hundreds of thousands, is entirely managed by his legal wife and son Lin Ruobo. Now, Lin Yuting's concubine, Lin Jiangsong, has hired a lawyer to request the partition of the estate, on the grounds that she has been abused by the legal wife and son since her husband's death, making it unbearable to live together." This is far from the truth. After my late father's death, the estate was only around 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, and nearly half of it has been spent on household expenses in recent years. As for the allegations of abuse, they are even more untrue. Lin Jiangsong voluntarily left home after my late father's death, and there was no abuse. This must be a misunderstanding by your reporter based on hearsay. I hope you will correct this to reflect the truth. Sincerely, Lin Ruobo, July 18.</p>

<h3>Securities: Big Players Strongly Absorb, New Buyers Emerge, Troop Reduction Dramatically Rises by $1.05</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange, continuing the previous rising momentum, the rising trend became more and more profound, big players and tycoons absorbed, never slackening, retail investors and new buyers emerged one after another, pushing the boat along the water, making the market prosperous and prosperous. Under the encirclement of the current bad environment, it can have such a good situation, which is not the power of support between big players. However, the delivery period for this month is only a few days, and whether the huge amount of long positions can have the strength to take delivery of goods is still a question, and the short positions of No. 78 and others are very large in number, and their strength is also very impressive. The market situation at the close yesterday has shown weakness. If a certain party's absorption is slightly frustrated, the bond market will have a downward trend. Yesterday, after the opening of the morning market, continuing the previous rising momentum, the rising trend became more and more profound, and the troop reduction dramatically rose by as much as 80 cents. The subsequent bonds, after 48.53 and other continued absorption, did not progress without progress. The buying enthusiasm stimulated retail investors, and new buyers emerged one after another. The second market was inherently downward according to the situation, but through the support of retail investors and 48 and others, it was able to maintain its current state, and then continued to rise by about 50 cents, which is really rare. By the 22nd level and below, the number of profit-taking long positions began to increase, and the 23rd level fell back by more than 50 cents. In summary, the results of the market prices in the two markets were not consistent. The troop reduction dramatically rose by a huge amount of $1.05, while the 23rd level fell back by 20 cents. The total turnover was 19,545,000 yuan. The following is a comparison table of the high and low results.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Current Yarn Production is Decreasing Amidst Rumors, Sichuan Merchants Continue to Buy</h3>
<p>The yarn market is quite strong, and the situation is getting better and better, because the current yarn sales market is more and more smooth, Sichuan merchants are especially eager to search, and many yarn mills are stopping and closing down, the production of cotton yarn is greatly reduced, and the current yarn roots are becoming more and more tight, and the market has a tendency to increase. However, most speculative merchants who sell yarn and buy flowers remain calm. Judging from the current situation, the August contract yarn may have the hope of 70 yuan.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Slowly Rising</p>
<p>The opening of the contract yarn was flat again in various months, and Changfeng came to sell again, and the table was normal. The near and far months both fell by 20 to 30 cents. When shooting to the second market, the market atmosphere in the market was still leisurely, and many said that Japanese merchants came to sell again, the popularity was not good, and it continued to fall by 30 to 40 cents. However, when shooting to the third closing, due to the sharp rise in raw cotton, the sales of current yarn from all parties came one after another, and the trading of chips in the exchange was especially popular. The popularity in the market recovered, and the buying enthusiasm suddenly rose. The market suddenly rose, and as a result, each month rose by 2, 4, 5, 7 cents to 1 yuan compared with the closing price of the previous day. It was found that 500 bales were sold by Zhenda, 500 bales by Gengfeng, 400 bales by Changyu, 450 bales by Renfeng, 2,150 bales by Changfeng, and 600 bales by Xincheng. 500 bales were bought by Tongji, 1,050 bales by Yida, 700 bales by Mingde, 1,050 bales by Shenji, 550 bales by Yichang, 450 bales by Runkang, and 500 bales by Deji. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices of the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Contract Yarn Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Up and Down Balance</p>
<p>July 163.9 163.5 163.9 Up 0.40 16,700</p>

<p>Total 191,600</p>
<p>Current Sales Are Still Smooth</p>
<p>The current yarn sales market is more and more smooth. It is found that all the statistics of various gangs buying are 1,588 bales, and the market price has risen by 1.5 yuan. More than 300 bales of Japanese yarn were traded. The purchase amount of each gang is as follows:</p>
<p>Sichuan 320 Ningbo 5 Shantou 80 Luzhou 30</p>

<h3>Recent Bull Squeeze in Cotton Market Becomes Increasingly Apparent</h3>
<p>The cotton market's upward trend is intensifying, with the July and August futures contracts showing particularly strong upward momentum. This is due to bullish traders controlling the market and remaining steadfast, deepening the expectation of a short squeeze. Many short sellers are showing signs of panic, and covering their positions is not uncommon. New cotton futures for distant months have also been spurred to rise. According to market sources, the severe flooding in the Hubei region has led to rumors that cotton production will only reach 20% of normal levels, resulting in a surge of new buyers.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Short Covering Frenzy</p>
<p>At the opening of the Shanghai Cotton Exchange, the market situation for all months remained stable initially. Near-month contracts were weaker due to selling pressure from Changfeng, but distant-month contracts were tighter, rising by 1 to 2 jiao. Buying interest surged during the second and third trading sessions, with short sellers covering their positions in near-month contracts and bullish traders unwilling to release their holdings, causing the market to rise further and further. Regarding new cotton, rumors of severe flooding in Hankou, with only 20% of the crop secured, led to an even greater influx of buyers, pushing prices up rapidly. As a result, all months closed higher than the previous day, with gains ranging from 4.5 to 6.5 jiao. The reported sales were: Mei Ji 2,600 dan, Tong Ji 2,800 dan, Yuan Da 3,300 dan, Jun Chang 1,800 dan, Yi Chang 1,800 dan, Changfeng 3,900 dan, Jian Kang 1,700 dan, and Yuan Xing Chang 2,200 dan. The reported purchases were: Da Fu 1,900 dan, Ming De 1,900 dan, Geng Feng 1,300 dan, Tong Feng 3,300 dan, Shen Ji 3,600 dan, Yuan Yi 1,200 dan, Da Chang Cheng 1,400 dan, Sheng Yuan 1,330 dan, Xin Cheng 1,300 dan, Xin Hua 1,000 dan, and Yi Kang 2,300 dan. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day were as follows:</p>

<p>Total        586,300</p>
<p>Mills' Spot Purchases Sluggish</p>
<p>Sales of spot cotton remain flat. Although cotton futures have risen, mills' appetite for purchases remains sluggish. Sources include 250 bales of Yao cotton and 150 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<p>Anqing Cotton   37.00   Purchased by Shenxin Factory   162 bales of spot goods delivered to the factory</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton   46.50   Purchased by Da Kang Factory   150 pieces of spot goods delivered to the factory</p>
<p>US Cotton Reverses Upward After Initial Decline</p>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton opened lower due to selling by brokers and Wall Street, with losses ranging from 2 to 10 points for various months. However, as the market widely believed that the circuit court's ruling was unreliable, Liverpool merchants and local traders all started buying. The wheat and stock markets were strong, triggering a market rebound. Trading volume is currently thin, so even small purchases can trigger a rally. Favorable weather reports are not attracting sellers. Ultimately, near-month contracts strengthened due to buying by industry players. Except for the May contract, which fell by 2 points, the remaining months rose by 2 to 11 points. Spot English cotton fell by 6 points, while futures fell by 3-4 points. Indian cotton initially weakened due to selling by European exporters but later strengthened due to buying by speculators. Gujerat fell by 1.5 to 2 rupees, Oomra fell by 2.25 rupees, and Broach fell by 1.75 to 2.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (Telegram of the 17th)</p>

<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for the April/May Broach cotton contract on the 18th is 224 rupees, up 1 rupee from the previous day's close.</p>
<h3>Grains: Flour Lacks Upward Momentum</h3>
<p>The flour market initially continued its positive trend but then leveled off. This was because Chicago prices rose by around 1 yuan for near-term contracts and 7-8 jiao for distant-term contracts. Canadian wheat rose by 1 jiao. Market sentiment initially favored foreign wheat, capitalizing on the previous day's momentum. Recent bids continued to be strong, rising by about 1 fen, but market sentiment remained stable during the second trading session. However, as large mills increased their selling, the market turned downwards from the third trading session onwards. Subsequent trading became sparse, with little activity on both sides. Domestically, all wheat-producing areas have been affected by flooding, making the future of grains a matter that cannot be taken lightly. However, due to tight credit, traders are inevitably hesitant, resulting in weaker buying power than before, which is also preventing the market from rebounding strongly. As a result, the current month remained unchanged, August rose slightly by 0.5 fen, September remained unchanged, October rose by 0.25 li, November rose by 0.5 fen, and December remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Wheat Trading Stalls Amidst Watchful Waiting</h3>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market in the morning and afternoon, all months showed a consistent trend of stagnation. Although foreign wheat prices were reported to have risen, market sentiment was largely cautious and watchful. Because the current month is subject to a spot squeeze, mills are mostly taking a wait-and-see approach, seemingly unable to support the market. Distant-month contracts were slightly better due to customer buying. However, there is no expectation of significant improvement in the short term. Yao Wan wheat opened at 3.38 yuan, followed by 3.35-3.36 yuan. Wu Yi wheat was 3.34-3.35 yuan, Nanjing and Hezhou wheat were 3.21-3.23 yuan, Baoying wheat was 3.35 yuan, Wuhe wheat was 3.36 yuan, and Luhe and Danyang wheat were 3.27 yuan. Yangzhou wheat was 3.35 yuan, Gaozi wheat was 3.23 yuan, Jiangxinzhou wheat was 3.24 yuan, and Puzhen wheat was 3.65 yuan. Fuxin sold 9,000 bags.</p>

<h3>River Rice Arrivals Scarce with Fresh Color</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the sources from various merchants became increasingly scarce, with only enough to cover the shipments arriving on the 6th (totaling about 1,000 shi). Market sentiment stabilized slightly, and the market turned stable due to the scarcity of goods, showing signs of strengthening. Although sales in the local market were normal, orders only amounted to 200-300 bags. As a result, the prices of high-quality japonica and thin indica rice were fresh and high. Medium-quality goods were mostly stable. As for Yinbian Yuan rice, its price had been falling daily, but now it has shown signs of rebounding by 3 jiao. The price of Du Jian rice is volatile.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, arrivals from various river ports were around 1,000 bags. Various grades of polished, white japonica rice continued to sell, and prices for high-quality goods were expected to rise. Prices for medium- and lower-quality goods edged up by nearly 1 jiao. Thin indica rice was scarce and rose by 1-2 jiao. Early rice was stable, and Zijinling rice was selling actively, rising by 3-4 jiao. The prices of other goods remained mostly unchanged.</p>
<h3>Imported Rice: Medium and Lower Grades Edge Up Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the imported rice market showed signs of weakening again. Although shipments were still being arranged along the Yangtze River, sales were minimal, unlike the domestic merchants who sold thousands of bags. Ningbo merchants were inquiring about medium- and lower-grade goods, but high-quality rice from Ningbo was experiencing slow sales and was being shipped to Shanghai for sale, which was the main reason for the market's weakness. Yesterday, sales of small and medium grades were weak, while there was no demand from hoarders for high-quality Saigon rice. Therefore, the prices of high-quality rice remained stable, while other grades edged up slightly. Total sales for the city amounted to more than 7,000 bags, with merchants from Hankou, Jiujiang, Nanjing, Ningbo, and the local market purchasing the goods. Domestic merchants have completely stopped buying.</p>
<h3>Bean Cake Fluctuates, Soybeans Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the bean cake market fluctuated. Factory cakes remained stable, while recycled goods were softer. Sales of various cakes have been brisk in recent days. Yesterday, 6,800 pieces of factory cake and 13,000 pieces of Zhabing cake were offered for sale. With the Great Heat approaching, sales are typically strong, so the future trend is expected to change several times. As for soybeans, factories in Shandong province were full and unable to purchase large quantities. Sales relied on scattered purchases from local merchants, and the market was unremarkable.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Zhenmei Green Tea Becomes More Active</h3>
<p>Sales of Zhenmei green tea from the roads of Luzhuang and Shizhuang have been slightly sluggish this week, but supply is limited, so the market has remained unchanged. Yesterday, Jinlong, Baochang, Yongxing, Huacha, and other firms resumed trading in goods from Wuyuan, Tunxi, Shexian, Wenzhou, and local Zhuang roads, and the market became more active. Extracted tea dominated the market, while various grades of needle-shaped, phoenix eyebrow, shrimp eye, and tribute teas also saw scattered sales. The market situation remains firm. Ningzhou black tea was imported by De Zhuang Xing Cheng foreign firm in 600 boxes, with a market price of 30 yuan, down 7-8 yuan from before.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: New Golden Lily Buds Weaken</h3>
<p>Since the arrival of new golden lily buds, the market had been stable due to strong demand from Guangdong merchants. However, prices in Guangzhou and Hong Kong have reportedly fallen, and demand has stalled. At the same time, arrivals from Zhenjiang, such as Daxingcai, Yanghuacai, Xiangzhuangcai, and Zhongxingcai, have increased, and Xu Zhou lily buds have also been arriving continuously. All merchants have lowered their prices uniformly, ranging from a few fen to several jiao. Land prices have also fallen accordingly.</p>

<h3>Textiles: Woolen Fabrics and Heavy Goods Arrive Continuously</h3>
<p>Woolen fabrics and heavy goods for autumn and winter sales, such as Melton cloth, plain heavy cloth, Zhigong Huate cloth, sweater cloth, medium-heavy serge, khaki cloth, riding breeches cloth, herringbone cloth, and coat cloth, have been arriving continuously from foreign firms recently. The majority of these are bonded goods. Foreign firms currently hold 30% of the spot goods. Ancient warehouses and Zhao Shang Bei Warehouses and Zhaoshan Warehouses, etc. have seen their stock of goods increase daily recently.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous News: Qiongzhou Cowhide, Long Interrupted, Arrives</h3>
<p>Qiongzhou cowhide had been scarce due to unfavorable exchange rates. Now that the Shanghai-Qiongzhou exchange rate has risen, reducing costs, market prices have gradually converged. The Qingyuan ship imported more than 10 pieces yesterday, which has loosened market expectations. The previous price for Rangoon hide was not comparable, but recent quotations have been low, creating a shortage. Previously, the price for Qiongzhou cowhide was 62-63 yuan for red sand hide, 42-43 yuan for red water hide, and 51-52 yuan for white back hide. Based on the current market situation, the price of the newly arrived goods is expected to fall by 2-3 yuan, making it difficult to complete transactions in the short term.</p>
<h3>Metals: Ribbed Steel Bars Difficult to Recover - Impact of Declining Construction Industry</h3>
<p>40-foot-long ribbed steel bars are essential for the construction industry. However, with frequent declines in land prices in Shanghai, construction projects have been greatly reduced. Furthermore, foreign traders are facing rural collapse, economic panic, and widespread flooding, which has greatly reduced the demand for this type of construction material. Frequent arrivals have resulted in huge stockpiles. Due to economic conditions, some traders are willing to sell at low prices, but there are few buyers. The standard is negatively affected by the adverse environment, leading to a worsening situation. Quotations for mixed colors are 90 yuan per ton. Retail prices range from 105 yuan to 87 yuan. In the past three days, only 40-50 tons have been offered for sale on the market, a decrease of one-third compared to the prosperous period. Therefore, it is feared that it will not be easy for the market to recover in the short term.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Zhu Weixuan)</p>
<p>The closing-down sale of small shops has almost become a new advertising technique in 1939, because although they shout closing down every day, they rarely actually do so. On the contrary, large companies and banks that boast about their strong capital and prosperous business often collapse with the speed of lightning and without any prior warning. This is probably the difference between large companies and small shops?</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "The benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom"! This describes how each person sees things differently, so one should not criticize others' good and bad based on personal subjective opinions. Often, a profligate son who gambles and indulges in pleasure until he is ruined is considered a bad person by everyone, but he is often considered a good person in brothels and gambling dens!</p>
<h3>Why Walk on the Left?</h3>
<p>— Pei Yu</p>
<p>I remember that one of the tenets of the New Life Movement was "Walk on the left." The purpose of establishing this tenet was probably to avoid congestion and maintain order. But why walk on the left and not on the right? If vehicles drive on the right and people also walk on the right, wouldn't it achieve the same effect of avoiding congestion and maintaining order? According to a British researcher, after much research, he has come up with a very reasonable and interesting explanation. He said that walking on the left is closely related to human physiology.</p>
<p>Here, let's first study a question, why are most of us better at using our right hand? It is said that because the heaviest organ in our body, the "liver", is located on the right side. Because the liver is on the right, we can easily turn from the right to the left. In this way, people in ancient times found that it was easier to wave a stick or throw a stone with their right hand than with their left hand. After many eras, the right hand continued to be easier to train than the left hand.</p>
<p>The use of hands is like this, but riding a horse is the opposite. Getting on the horse from the left side, which is opposite to the side where the liver is located, and staying close to the side of the road is safer. Therefore, the rule of walking on the left side of the road was passed down from the time when everyone rode horses. However, on British pavements, you have to walk on the right, because it is easier to get off the horse or vehicle on the right side of the pavement. The road rule "walk on the left" and the pavement rule "walk on the right" both came from the relationship between riding and physiology.</p>
<h3>Wooden Fish and Dragon Boat Songs</h3>
<p>— Lan Shan</p>
<p>I recently read Mr. Zhang Yide's "Wooden Fish" article in this journal, which introduced Cantonese folk literature to us, and I admire it very much. However, Mr. Zhang has misunderstood many places in the article, and there are also places that are not explained in detail. The following is a supplement and correction.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang said that "Wooden Fish" is like a short essay, and "Bullet Songs" is like a long novel, which is wrong. In fact, "Wooden Fish" is a very lengthy segmented song, just like a novel. It takes more than a whole day to sing the whole book. However, something that resembles a short story or essay is another kind, not called "Wooden Fish", but the very famous "Dragon Boat Song".</p>
<p>Because "Wooden Fish" is too long, not everyone can sing it. But "Dragon Boat Songs" are short and concise, with melancholy and lingering emotions, and everyone remembers and likes to hum a few verses.</p>
<p>"Wooden Fish" such as "Purple Xia Cup", "Jade Sunflower Fan", "Unbinding the Red Silk Robe", "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai", etc. are really magnificent, with tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of words. After the old lady finishes her supper, she is encouraged by her daughters-in-law and maids to put on her reading glasses and start singing. She can sing four or five sections in an hour.</p>
<p>The Dragon Boat Song is different, everyone can sing it. We who are called "A Shao" can sing it, and so can the maids and servants. The most common ones are "Autumn Regret on a Journey", "Chen Shimei Denies His Wife", "Bin Yu Cries at the Funeral" and "He Huiqun Sighs at the Fifth Watch".</p>
<p>"The silkworm spins silk until it dies, and the candle sheds tears until it is ash. A good marriage is achieved, but it fills me with endless sorrow. A spring dream is empty, all because of shallow fate and no cause for love..." These are wonderful lines from the funeral song. As for "Autumn Regret on a Journey" and "Sighing at the Fifth Watch", which are unanimously praised by the literati, they are both Dragon Boat Songs, with beautiful words and sad and poignant tones, which can be sung a hundred or a thousand times without getting tired.</p>
<p>Singing "Wooden Fish" and "Dragon Boat Songs" is not without rhythm and pitch, as Mr. Zhang said, but it must follow a certain tune, which we call "Southern Music", with ups and downs, which is very pleasant to the ear. In short, "Wooden Fish" and "Dragon Boat Songs" are mostly based on love between men and women. Although there are works that are loyal to the emperor and patriotic, they are not to people's liking, so they are shelved.</p>
<p>In Guangdong, there is a kind of "blind girl" who sells songs, singing a good "Dragon Boat Song" and "Wooden Fish" for a very low price.</p>
<h3>Mr. Earth's Unease</h3>

<h3>Guyi Garden and the Dung Old Man Qi Yi</h3>
<p>— Shu Fan</p>
<p>Fuzzy human figure weaving long corridor. War fire towards the wilderness. Trees also sigh wind more sentiment. Crows like guests say vicissitudes. A pot of vitality peach purple. Half a foot of warm sun reed water yellow. Traces of leaving and coming are all dreams. Hurriedly come and go for whom busy.</p>
<h3>Night Drink Shows Dung Old Man Qi Yi</h3>
<p>Although no bone-melting Tang Qu tears. Words to request already eliminated. Entering the market golden all turn into tigers. Squirting intestines each become a tide. What year Jiang bamboo holds your hand. How many times see Fern redeem waist. Peeping through the door losing to butcher vendors. Two streets snoring answer horse hoof proud.</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>

<p>Chapter Sixteen: The Curtain Hides Tears Hard to Escape Cold Eyes, Clothing Brags About Luck, Meeting Power</p>
<p>He smiled and said: Mr. Cheng, there is one thing, quite sorry to you. Zhiqian smiled and said: What are you talking about? We are new friends to each other, and there is not much to it. Where does these three words "sorry" come from? Jie Fu smiled: I don't need to say this, I think you know. It's just... Saying, his voice lowered, and he laughed, "It's just that Miss Zhu has already been kept in a golden house by Brother Duocai." Originally, this child was very interested in you, but this is a bit of you letting go. Zhiqian was initially angry and his face turned purple. After a thought, he laughed, and smoothed the purple color on his face. Because said: These words can be said to be far away. Mr. Jia's concubine has nothing to do with me. Even if it interferes with me, you can't ask Mr. Zhang to apologize to me. Isn't this thing very interesting? Jie Fu said: No, I am very good with Mr. Jia, I can represent say sorry. Zhiqian thought for a while and laughed: Is this from Mr. Jia's meaning? Or is it from Mr. Zhang's meaning? Jie Fu said: Mr. Jia has an intention, but it is inconvenient for him to say it. I just came back from the two places of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Construction, and I talked with Duocai for a long time. Zhiqian said: Is the bride very happy? Jie Fu said: That's natural. Don't you see me wearing a mandarin jacket? I am because of seeing the two directors. Otherwise; adding a mandarin jacket is also very hot. Zhiqian said: That girl has changed from being so poor that she wants to beg for food, to becoming a banker's concubine, of course she is happy. What did she say? While speaking, the porter had already opened the door for him. (269)</p>
<h3>Imperial Incense Drifting Record</h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Deling of Qing, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>I originally wanted to ask her for help, but unexpectedly I was subjected to a very embarrassing ridicule. I couldn't help but turn from fear to anger. I decided to ignore everything and go directly to the Empress Dowager to ask for a clear understanding of how I would be treated. At that time, I didn't have time to think, and immediately left the female officer and walked into the Empress Dowager's bedroom. Moreover, because of excessive anger, my cheeks were flushed. The Empress Dowager looked very surprised when I walked in, because she had not sent anyone to summon me: and according to the rules of the palace, I was absolutely not allowed to enter her bedroom without being summoned. Now I openly violated this rule, so she naturally felt very surprised! I didn't know what to say first, so I knelt down and bowed my head in front of her seat.</p>
<p>"Deling, why are you back again?" she quickly questioned me.</p>
<p>"Empress Dowager, I am here to kowtow to the old Buddha and apologize!" I mustered up my courage and replied to her; but my courage was limited after all, and after saying the first sentence, I couldn't help but cry. "This servant now knows that she should not have dissuaded the Empress Dowager from going to the long corridor to take a walk; it is said that in this way, I have committed a great crime, and it is said that if you don't leave, you will be beheaded, so I am anxious to apologize. Please forgive me this time!"</p>
<p>"Stand up!" The Empress Dowager was not angry just now, but now she was a little angry when she heard me tell the truth. She asked me questions like a pearl: "Who told you? Is it Li Lianying? Or which female official?"</p>
<p>"Not Chief Manager Li! It was ×× who told this servant!" I suppressed my crying and replied, "The other female officials also said that what she told me was true." (369)</p>
<h3>World's Greatest</h3>
<p>— Da Qian</p>
<p>Humans have a mind that refuses to be complacent, so the world's highest records in various fields are constantly being improved. Yesterday's best is today's second, and some may not even be able to maintain their second position. Compiling one or two examples to show the evolution of world affairs, perhaps in the blink of an eye, these records will become outdated? Alas!</p>
<p>World's Largest Merchant Ship The world's fastest sailing record for merchant ships has been set by the recently launched French liner Normandie, the world's largest merchant ship. The Normandie is 1,029 feet long, 128 feet wide, and 128 feet high from the keel to the top of the bridge. It has a tonnage of 79,280, surpassing all other ships in the world. About ten million rivets were used during construction, about four thousand miles of electrical wire of various thicknesses, and about fifty miles of water and steam pipes of various thicknesses. It employs 187 chefs, 628 tea servers, and 108 deck sailors. Its grand dining hall is 300 feet long, which is even more astonishing. Recently, it sailed on its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to the United States, arriving at the Port of New York at 10:30 AM on June 3, taking four days, three hours, three minutes, and eighteen seconds, having crossed the Atlantic Ocean at an average speed of 29.68 nautical miles per hour (slightly larger than a mile, about 3.3 *li* in our country), surpassing the previous world record of 28.9 nautical miles per hour set by the Italian liner Rex (54,000 tons) departing from the Strait of Gibraltar. The fastest single day covered 748 nautical miles, averaging 31.17 nautical miles per hour, with a maximum speed reaching .9 nautical miles, which is currently the fastest record for all merchant ships in the world and exceeds the maximum speed limit of our country's trains! The Normandie's electric propulsion motors are powered by electricity generated by steam engines. The fuel for the steam engines is oil, with a steam pressure of 400 pounds per square inch and a temperature of 660 degrees Fahrenheit. This indirect power transmission system reduces the noise of the machinery. There are four generators, each with 40,000 horsepower, totaling 160,000 horsepower, which is equivalent to the power of ten average merchant ships in the Atlantic Ocean. The only ships in the world with more power are the American warships Saratoga and Lexington, aircraft carriers designed for high speed! These two ships each have 180,000 horsepower, divided into eight generators, each with 22,500 horsepower. The Normandie has four generators, so each generator is even larger than those on the aforementioned two ships. If this electricity were applied on land, it could supply the entire city of Boston, USA (population 787,271), which is also astonishing!</p>
<p>World's Largest Tree Among the many large trees in California, USA, the large trees in the Sequoia Grove are particularly famous. Previously, people who talked about large trees regarded the General Sherman tree in the Sequoia Grove as the world's largest tree. Geography books also often mention the name of Sequoia. Recently, Galkin and Meers, based on the large forest pointed out by Boutte, a resident of the Kaweah River, 45 years ago, engaged in exploration and actual photographic surveying. Over the years, they discovered several trees last year that were larger than the General Sherman tree. The largest one has a trunk circumference of 124 feet 6 inches at the base, exceeding the General Sherman's base circumference record of 10 feet 6 inches by more than 20 feet. It is about 4,000 years old, more than 1,000 years older than the General Sherman's 3,000 years. The title of world's tree king should belong to this newly discovered one. The treetop of this large tree has been broken off by strong winds, but it is still 200 feet tall. The trees next to it, although not as large, are up to 300 feet tall. This large tree grove is also called the Galkin Grove because Galkin and others were the first to carry out measurements. The location is also part of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California.</p>
<p>World's Largest Airplane Russia has several large airplanes that can carry 40 to 50 passengers. Germany has specially built a large airplane to overwhelm them. The largest airplane currently owned by Germany is equipped with eight propellers, has a total weight of 70 tons (about 100,000 catties in our country), a wingspan of 190 feet, and can carry 70 passengers. It is named Maxon Gorky and is currently the world's largest airplane.</p>
<p>World's Largest Telescope The world's largest telescope is currently in the United States, with a lens diameter of 100 inches. It is located at the Mount Wilson Observatory in Pasadena, California, USA. The California Institute of Technology, located before Mount Wilson, is planning to build a 200-inch diameter large telescope, which is four times larger than the current largest telescope. Work has been underway for several years, and a 120-inch diameter test lens has now been completed. The final lens (i.e., the 200-inch diameter lens) will be about 26 inches thick and weigh about 20 tons (about 30,000 catties in our country). It has already been cast in New York and is gradually cooling down. It can be transported to the California Institute of Technology this winter for grinding. It is expected to be completed within three years. The location for installing this telescope has been selected on Mount Palomar, about 70 miles southeast of Mount Wilson. The mountain is about 6,000 feet high. The decision on this location was made after five years of investigation, comparison, and discussion by a site selection committee organized by various experts. After the telescope is completed, special attention will be paid to observing nebulae and the temperature, density, and changes of stars farther away from Earth. Based on the unprecedented light-gathering power of this telescope, it can be asserted that there will be many new cosmic discoveries.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Order Instructs Nantong College to Genuinely Improve</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued an order on the 18th to the private Nantong College. The original order stated, "The Ministry has sent personnel to inspect the college. According to the submitted report, after careful review, the college aims to cultivate practical talents and has been operating for many years with some success. However, there are many areas that need improvement. The key points are highlighted as follows: (1) Although the college's land area is large, it has not been fully utilized. There is no fixed income for operating expenses, and there have been frequent deficits in recent years. The board of directors should find ways to fully develop the land to increase the foundation and raise funds to meet current needs. (2) The college's agronomy, chemistry, and dyeing and chemical engineering departments have poor equipment and few students. Given the current financial difficulties, consideration may be given to suspending them. The main courses can be incorporated into the agronomy and textile departments. Expansion can be considered when the college's funds are sufficient in the future. (3) The college's curriculum can still focus on practice. In the future, it is necessary to increase opportunities for students to conduct independent research. Teachers are dedicated and diligent in guidance. However, the few professors teaching basic subjects in the medical and textile departments should be carefully selected. (4) The college's science equipment is generally complete, but the experimental equipment for basic subjects in the medical department is particularly simple. Efforts should be made to integrate the courses with the agricultural department for utilization. The soil and fertilizer research equipment of the agricultural department and the main equipment of the dyeing and chemical engineering department of the textile department need to be enriched. Books and magazines should be selectively added. (5) The college's agricultural science buildings are old, and the medical science capacity is narrow, both of which need to be repaired or expanded. The textile testing hall of the textile department should be built and completed as soon as possible. The college is hereby ordered to comply with these instructions, genuinely improve, and report."</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Education Department Orders Middle Schools to Enrich Science Experiment Equipment to Enhance Students' Experimental Skills</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Education Department believes that most middle schools have not purchased complete equipment for physics, chemistry, and biology experiments, so students only know the theory and cannot experiment, which reduces students' experimental skills, which is extremely important for their academic future. Therefore, it specifically ordered all middle schools to enrich various scientific equipment as soon as possible. If there are economic difficulties, those that are easy to obtain can be purchased first for students to experiment with.</p>

The team's planned itinerary before departure was to first go to Shanghai and Nanjing, then to Suzhou and Hangzhou, and return via Xiamen and Shantou.

<h3>Integrity</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>In Chinese history, the so-called scholar-gentlemen valued integrity above all else. Taking shortcuts and evading responsibilities were not the Confucian way. During the late Eastern Han Dynasty, when the Disaster of the Partisan Prohibitions arose, Zhang Jian was forced to flee for his life. Regardless of which family he sought refuge with, as long as they knew it was Zhang Jian, knowing that it would cause great trouble, everyone was willing to ruin their families to accommodate him. When Fan Pang was first imprisoned in the Yellow Gate Northern Temple Prison, many of his fellow prisoners were ill. Pang volunteered to be the first to be flogged and subjected to the three types of torture, his head covered and exposed on the steps. When Pang was pardoned and returned home, he was implicated in Zhang Jian's case. The court issued a decree to arrest Fan Pang and others. Wu Dao, the postal inspector, embraced the edict, closed his door, and wept on his bed. Fan Pang heard the news and knew that the postal inspector was doing it for his own sake, so he went to the county to surrender himself. Guo Yi, the county magistrate, resigned his official seal and was willing to go with Fan Pang, saying to Pang, "The world is so big, how did you come to this end?" Fan Pang said, "If I die, the great disaster will be over. How can I implicate others?" Pang said goodbye to his mother and went to prison. His mother comforted him, saying, "To die with Li Ying and Du Mi, is it not very glorious?" The Partisan Prohibitions implicated Li Ying, and someone advised Li Ying to flee. Li Ying said, "It is not difficult to deal with things, and not escaping punishment for one's crimes is the duty of a subject. I am already sixty this year, and life and death are ordained. Where can I escape to?" He went to prison and died from the toxic torture. Those implicated in the Partisan Prohibitions, including their students, former officials, and their fathers and brothers, were all on the list of prohibitions. Jing Yi of Shu County had his son become a disciple of Li Ying. Because there was no official record, he was exempt from the prohibitions. Jing Yi voluntarily requested to be dismissed from office, saying, "Because I admired Li Ying's character, I asked my son to follow him. How can I be complacent just because his name was omitted from the list?" From these various instances, one can imagine the situation at that time, where scholar-gentlemen valued integrity, disregarded their lives, and were unwilling to evade responsibilities and take shortcuts.</p>
<p>When misfortune strikes, many relatives and friends will avoid suspicion and disaster. However, according to Confucian principles, avoiding suspicion and disaster is also inappropriate. Kong Rong was upright and often clashed with Cao Cao. His friend Zhi Xi often advised Rong to be wise and protect himself. Later, Kong Rong was killed by Cao Cao, and his body was displayed in Xuxia, but no one dared to collect it. Zhi Xi went to caress the body and wept bitterly, disregarding being detained by Cao Huan. Similarly, when Zhang Jian fled to the State of Lu because of the Partisan Prohibitions, he wanted to seek refuge with Kong Bao. It happened that Kong Bao was not at home, but Kong Rong, who was only sixteen years old, took him in without authorization. Later, the matter was revealed, and Bao and Rong were both arrested and sent to prison. Kong Rong stepped forward and said, "I was the one who took in Zhang Jian. Please punish me!" Kong Bao said, "Zhang Jian came to me, and it has nothing to do with my younger brother. Please punish me!" The officials could not decide for a long time, so they had to ask their mother for her opinion. The mother said, "I am the head of the family, and I am responsible. Please punish me!" The whole family struggled to die, and even the county could not decide. When we look at this spirit of sacrificing oneself for righteousness, it still inspires us thousands of years later. No wonder it shook the hearts of ordinary people at that time, and everyone wanted to hone their integrity!</p>
<p>"The greatest sorrow is the death of the heart." If everyone considers it advantageous to take shortcuts and evade responsibilities, then every Chinese scholar will become a "traitor"! As the saying of "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame" is flourishing, I hope that the people of our country will pay attention to the word "shame" and value "integrity" above all else.</p>
<h3>Large Fried Dough Sticks (You Tiao)</h3>
<p>— Qin Wen</p>
<p>The year my nephew was born, my sister-in-law was teaching. If she resigned to breastfeed herself, the living expenses would not be enough. After calculating, she thought it was better to hire a wet nurse, although she knew it was not very appropriate, she had no choice but to do it.</p>
<p>The wet nurse was very diligent and saved even more money. In the two years, she didn't seem to have exchanged her formal salary of one yuan. Since she became a wet nurse, the money her husband sent home every month was enough to cover the children fostered in the neighbors. Her salary was saved in full. When the nephew was weaned, because of her good credit, she borrowed dozens of dollars more. Her husband was originally from a tofu-making family, so they opened a small tofu shop together. The business was not bad. They took back the children, reunited the family, and the man made the tofu and the woman sold it. It was indeed envious - this was two years ago.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, over the past year or so, business has gradually become sluggish. It was not because the tofu was made badly, nor was it because she offended any customers. It was just that radishes and cabbages were too cheap. Two or three copper coins could buy a large pile, and even pork was six or seven catties for one yuan. Rent and taxes were still high, but tofu could not be reduced in price. Unless it's a vegetarian dish, tofu is not considered anything. Who would be willing to pay a high price to buy this kind of thing to eat? In order to maintain the business, the wet nurse's tofu shop started selling fried stinky tofu. Although it was a small supplement, the sales of tofu became worse and worse, and it was still not enough to make ends meet, so they started selling fried dough sticks (you tiao).</p>
<p>The nephew could already walk, but the family situation became more and more dismal, so they simply ate lunch boxes: breakfast was porridge, with a plate of fried dough sticks, which were cut into very small pieces. The nephew was not satisfied and often clamored to go to the wet nurse's to eat whole fried dough sticks.</p>
<p>This day there was no sun, nor was it raining. Although it was early summer, it was as gloomy as late autumn. It was very stuffy indoors, so my sister-in-law took her nephew for a walk. I knew that once they went out, they would always go to the wet nurse's tofu shop for a turn, and I happened to meet them at the door on their way back.</p>
<p>"Did you eat fried dough sticks?" I asked casually.</p>
<p>"There are only two large fried dough sticks!" My sister-in-law replied angrily.</p>
<p>"Two, isn't that enough?"</p>
<p>"That's really a fried dough stick, it's two pieces of wood, it looks like two large fried dough sticks, crossed and nailed to the front of the shop, probably because of too much debt, it was sealed!"</p>
<p>"Couldn't see them," my sister-in-law said excitedly, "Don't know where they went, maybe they were held in court."</p>
<p>The nephew had already walked into the room, and my sister-in-law was still standing blankly at the entrance, looking very touched. She really had deep sympathy for the wet nurse, but what's the use of that? Everyone understood early on that the debt was growing day by day, which was not a solution, but there was no way to stop the long-term decline in the price of radishes and cabbages - farmers carried a heavy burden, but they could only sell them for a few dozen copper coins. It was difficult enough to plant and work hard, and the reward was only a very small amount.</p>
<p>In fact, my sister-in-law herself was not to be lamented. After being the principal of a municipal elementary school for many years, she had only been a nanny for her own children for two years. She couldn't do it well because she had to save money on food and clothing!</p>

<h3>Condolences for a Friend Who Died of Lovesickness</h3>
<p>— Shen Shengshi</p>
<p>A fragile dream, like a soap bubble bursting,</p>
<p>You took it so seriously.</p>
<p>I can't think of the best words</p>
<p>To comfort your infatuated soul.</p>
<p>The world is not as innocent as you imagined;</p>
<p>Pure love has long fallen into hardship.</p>
<p>Only gold can hold onto beautiful dreams.</p>
<p>All the beauty is just fabricated lies.</p>
<p>Life is not a smooth circle;</p>
<p>Not every dream comes true according to your wishes.</p>
<p>What you yearn for often slips through your fingers,</p>
<p>And the most vexing things are chained to your ankles for life,</p>
<p>Not easily loosened until death.</p>
<p>Only the fragile dreams you clung to,</p>
<p>Were like bubbles, shattered by a single gust of wind.</p>
<p>Now you have entered the dark world.</p>
<p>Death is life's greatest rest.</p>
<p>The wild grass and idle flowers on the grave path</p>
<p>May still disturb your soul.</p>
<p>On stormy, rainy nights,</p>
<p>There may be a regret knocking on your frozen heart.</p>
<h3>Mirror</h3>
<p>— Luo Jia</p>
<p>Usually, I don't pay much attention to my clothes, and I don't even care about the oil on my face or my unkempt beard. Every morning, before I can carefully wipe away the overnight grime, there are already things waiting for me to do. Because of this hasty grooming, it's easy to leave some dirt on my face. My face isn't naturally fair, so any dirt left uncleaned makes my complexion dull and lifeless. If at this moment I suddenly thought of wanting to know something about the future and went to visit an old fortune teller, then what he would tell me would definitely be, "Your luck is not good this year!" Although, someone as busy with the present as I am doesn't have the refined leisure to visit fortune tellers!</p>
<p>Perhaps some might say that "sloppy appearance" is a quirk of scholars, but this saying has no effect on me at all, because I am neither a scholar nor do I aspire to be one, so why would I want to imitate famous scholars and feign elegance? And how dare I! In fact, if someone said I was ashamed, that might be somewhat reasonable. For the sake of living, I've had to become too lazy to bother with things like grooming! Once ashamed, it becomes a habit, and I can no longer change it.</p>
<p>It was probably one day in May when I went to visit a friend. It so happened that in my friend's parlor, there were two young ladies who were also guests, just like me. When I walked into the parlor, I found that these two young ladies were staring at me with an expression as if they wanted to laugh but couldn't, which made me very embarrassed! Because I rarely socialize with the opposite sex in my life. But I always thought that these two young ladies were probably laughing at my tattered long gown, and I was a little disdainful of them in my heart. However, my friend quietly called me into his bedroom and told me that there was a smudge of ink on my face. Then I suddenly understood the reason why the two young ladies were laughing at me; at the same time, I also felt the need for a mirror! If I had looked in the mirror when I went out, then I could have avoided being laughed at by the young ladies.</p>
<p>Because I couldn't forget the young ladies' mockery, I resolved to buy a mirror, and the mirror was finally bought! This mirror is very beautiful, not to mention the crystal-clear and shiny surface; the pearly and jade-colored, goose-yellow bakelite frame alone is enough for me to ponder and applaud! So, I reverently placed it on my desk, thinking that this mirror would help me pay attention to news of my youth!</p>
<p>Because of premature maturity, I became a melancholic young man—no, an old young man! Yes, I think the phrase "old young man" is the most suitable for my elegant self-description. Since I had a mirror, I had even clearer evidence. Isn't that so? Every time I look at myself in the mirror, I often can't believe that the shadow in the mirror is me! If it is me, then I want to ask, where is my youth? Where is my youth? Could it be that my youth has withered silently without leaving a trace? Naturally, when a person discovers that their youth has withered silently, what kind of words should be used to describe that person's sadness in the most accurate way? However, I now have only a heart of twenty! Why is my face so old? Why are there already indelible wrinkles on my forehead? Moreover, why has the lively smile of my youth been replaced by a kind of silence that knows the ways of the world? Ah! If I indulge in my feelings and keep thinking about it, I will become an artist! Life, life, life devoured my youth, life painted over the radiance of youth on my face, terrible life!</p>
<p>To avoid my own sadness, I threw the mirror into the corner of the room, letting dust and cobwebs bury it!</p>
<h3>I Love Solitude</h3>
<p>— Luo Hong</p>
<p>Because I am exhausted from being worn down by life, because my heart has been pricked by the thorns around me, I have come to love solitude even more lately. Now, I understand how easily a pure heart can be damaged, and how easily courage to move forward can be blocked by the environment. If you act with uprightness and give fairness to others, someone will surely laugh at your foolishness openly and sabotage you secretly. If you kindly do something or say a word for others, the result will be their malice. Even if you read a book for yourself, someone will laugh at you and spread rumors. So, a pure heart slowly becomes depressed, surrounded by this filthy air. Therefore, in the whirlpool of crowds, I deeply feel loneliness; the meaning of this loneliness buries my youthful and active heart in a gloomy cellar.</p>
<p>Around me, there is no hope, no joy, not even friendship. When I laugh, the iron palm of sorrow crushes me; when I muster courage, disappointment blocks me; so, in the end, I only get loneliness.</p>
<p>I love solitude, to have a little leisure in life, to think alone about the past and the future, which is much more interesting than finding a friend to say many irrelevant and boring things; or to be alone in a pile of books, reading freely, crying and laughing with the characters in the book, with no one to interfere with you, which is much better than listening to others' scolding.</p>
<p>I am not learning from the elegant scholars of ancient and modern times, deliberately avoiding the crowd and singing high-pitched tunes alone. I just want to silently endure the pain and silently put my heart in a place with more moonlight. The victory achieved by striving in solitude is not worth exaggerating, and the failure in solitude is not enough to make courage completely disappear.</p>
<p>A friend wrote to me and said: "Why are you so silent? Won't you resist the environment?..." This friend also wrote many words of concern for me, but I cannot accept her kindness. I really want to laugh at my friend for being too naive. She doesn't yet know how my innocent heart, like hers, has been damaged.</p>
<p>I wish that this unfortunate fate of mine would spend my life steadily in solitude.</p>
<h3>University Days (26)</h3>
<p>— From the German of Storm, translated by Chen Yinshi</p>
<p>Before he finished speaking, I had already walked to the desk and counted a handful of gold coins onto the table. "Is that enough, Christoph?"</p>
<p>"I thank you, Philip." He carefully put the gold coins into his money bag, which already had many gold and silver coins in it. Only then did I notice that he was standing in front of me wearing his black Sunday clothes.</p>
<p>"You've put on your formal dress," I asked, "where have you been just now?"</p>
<p>"This..." he said, thoughtfully rubbing his broad forehead with his hand, "I went to the police station!"</p>
<p>"Have you gotten your passport yet?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I even have my letter of resignation."</p>
<p>I stared at him with a questioning look.</p>
<p>"It's because of that silly thing at the dance hall."</p>
<p>Suddenly, my mind lit up. "So that's it! So you're the one?" I asked him; "Look at me, I didn't even think it was you!"</p>
<p>"I was indeed there, Philip."</p>
<p>"Was Rena Li with you?"</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>"So you gave the 'Count' a beating?"</p>
<p>A smile of revenge appeared on his lips. "They say I hit him," he replied.</p>
<p>The old nemesis in the student world said this with a satisfied tone, which made me have no doubt about the matter.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but laugh out loud. "Tell me! How did that happen?"</p>
<p>"This..., Philip! Don't you already know I went with Rena Li?"</p>
<p>"Did you two make an appointment to go together?"</p>
<p>"That's how it happened." he replied. "She is a very talented person, and after Aunt's death she can get a small estate."</p>
<p>I looked at him with a smile. "Christoph," I said, "She is usually very good; it's just you, you are usually not so easy to hit people!" He stared ahead for a while. "I was also baffled," he said, "We were standing in line, Nali and I, —I went there just to help her interest—the pale-faced tall guy came, he had often stared at her, and at this time he said a few words in a low voice to another person, and he wanted to dance with her specially regardless of the order.</p>
<p>"Then wasn't he too rude to your dance partner?"</p>

<h3>The Problem of Water Conservancy Construction Under Severe Floods</h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>Recently, the Yangtze River, Yellow River, Qiantang River, and the Three Rivers of Guangdong Province have all reported a surge in water levels. Many embankments and dikes along the rivers have been destroyed, and floods have become a disaster. Although the authorities of various provinces have been actively carrying out disaster relief and flood prevention work, the water of the rivers is surging fiercely, and the dangerous situation is increasing day by day. The terror of the national flood disaster of 1931 has reappeared today. China, which is deeply troubled by foreign aggression, will suffer another blow, and the future national economy and people's livelihood will be even more unimaginable.</p>
<p>Floods have been a disaster since ancient times. Our country's authorities have neither made a fundamental plan for water control, nor can they only panic and do their best when threatened by major floods each time. This is the only method of water control throughout history. The great flood of 1931 gave us a major warning. If the Chinese people can learn from this severe injury and urgently take precautions, today's disasters, if they cannot be avoided, will not be so widespread. Therefore, the dangerousness of this flood is not the result of the past water control policies of following the old ways and doing nothing.</p>
<p>Floods are originally a natural disaster, but human power can overcome nature. As long as prevention is appropriate, it is not difficult to overcome. However, our country adopts a method of treating the head when the head hurts and treating the feet when the feet hurt for flood prevention work. Never think about it from the root and make a permanent plan.</p>
<p>However, can fundamental water control be allowed by our country's economic strength today? According to the investigation of many foreign water conservancy experts, the fundamental method of preventing the floods of the Yangtze River and Yellow River is not in raising the dikes, but in the construction of water conservancy. Increasing the dikes is not only not a way to prevent flooding, but once the water collapses, the disaster will be even more dangerous. However, water conservancy construction must raise huge funds to purchase water conservancy machinery for implementation. At this time of national poverty and people's poverty, our country has no such ability. Recently, a reporter from the Central News Agency visited a foreign water conservancy expert to inquire about water control methods. According to the discussion, he believes that the method of raising funds to purchase machines for water control is not suitable for the current China. But he believes that China's hoes and plows and other agricultural tools can be used as good machines for water control. If the authorities of various provinces in China can supervise the hardworking Chinese people to use their hoes and plows and other agricultural tools to open tributaries on both sides of the river. At the same time, the water conservancy organs should abandon their work of raising the dikes and focus on the dredging of the waterways. Then not only can floods be avoided, but also river water can be diverted to irrigate fields, which is a gain in many ways. We are not water conservancy experts, and we know nothing about water conservancy construction. However, according to the water conservancy expert, the above-mentioned opinions are confident enough for the Chinese water conservancy authorities to study. I hope the Chinese people will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>Jealousy</h3>
<p>— Tuo Ren</p>
<p>"Miss Lan's Eyes"—an ear-piercing name rushed into the director's ears. He darted a sharp, fire-spewing glance at the clerk, his eyes fixed unmovingly on the clerk's face. The sudden stare made the clerk feel a terrifying threat, but he couldn't escape. He had no choice but to say, swallowing his pride, "Director, I say, hurry up and bring Miss Lan over. It'll save you from running back and forth every day."</p>
<p>The clerk stammered out these words, thinking that he had certainly hit the director's secret heart this time! But unexpectedly, the director still didn't say a word, his eyes still fixed on the clerk's face. At this point, the clerk also felt his own failure, felt awkward, and he fell silent as well.</p>
<p>After a dozen minutes of silence, the clerk reached out on the desk and groped for a cigar, offering it to the director, who was lying on the sofa, while he himself held a cigarette. So the two temporarily used smoking to replace the silence. Finally, the director opened his mouth and said,</p>
<p>"You would never think that from last night until now, I haven't been able to solve a problem."</p>
<p>After the director finished speaking, his eyes fixed on the clerk's face again. The clerk, who was good at flattery and known to be very good at thinking up cunning and insidious things, thought it was time to speak. So he said with a smile,</p>
<p>"Director, how could someone like you have any problems that are difficult to solve? I've already planned out that sum of money, everything is no problem. According to my calculations, every month... Humph, every month we should have at least five or six thousand, and..."</p>
<p>The clerk went on and on, but the director became impatient. He interrupted the clerk and said, no longer letting him go on,</p>
<p>"That's not it, you know? That hateful guy, I..."</p>
<p>The clerk knew he had said the wrong thing and immediately changed his tone, asking,</p>
<p>"Who? Is someone opposing you, Director? Is it that the chairman of the chamber of commerce doesn't approve of drawing construction fees? Or... Ah! How hateful! Director, you don't need to worry about these things!"</p>
<p>Every year, the clerk was responsible for planning some money matters for the director. All the director's difficult matters were nothing more than these, so he paid attention only to these issues. But the director spoke out himself.</p>
<p>"Damn it, that guy Huang Shiqi, I must deal with him..." He paused, took a puff of his cigar, and said again, "Doesn't he know that I'm going to marry Lan Mei next month? He, humph, still wants to fool around. You think, last night he even went to her place."</p>
<p>These sudden words stunned the clerk. This was truly unexpected. It turned out that the director was troubled by something that no amount of searching would uncover in his entire brain. He was silent for a few minutes before saying to the director,</p>
<p>"So... How about Miss Lan? That guy Huang Shiqi is really no good!"</p>
<p>"Her? What about her? I'm willing to marry her, wouldn't she be willing? But that guy Huang Shiqi must be dealt with a bit!"</p>
<p>After hearing the director's answer, the clerk lowered his head, silently smoking his cigarette. The clerk, who was specialized at thinking of cunning and insidious things, could only be silent on this matter. He searched his heart, mind, gut—every clever part of him. After a quarter of an hour, he looked at the director very seriously and said,</p>
<p>"The best way to deal with him is to dismiss him, but the reason must be grand, that is, 'secretly consorting with prostitutes.' But, I'm afraid that's too easy on him."</p>
<p>After hearing the clerk use the crime of "secretly consorting with prostitutes" on Huang Shiqi, the director thought it was not bad. But he also thought that this was still too light of a punishment. So the anger on the director's face gradually faded, and he said to the clerk with a smile,</p>
<p>"You're really smart. This method is very good. Do it immediately. Write a notice and a letter of dismissal!"</p>
<p>Having received the answer, a victorious smile floated on the clerk's cunning and insidious face.</p>
<p>So everything in the director's office returned to silence, with only the sound of the clerk writing the notice and official letter on the desk resonating for a long time. (End)</p>
<h3>Small Chronicle of the Customs of the Bai Yi</h3>
<p>— Dan Er</p>
<p>The Bai Yi people live on the edge of the Chinese begonia leaf. They are considered part of China and should be Chinese people; however, the old habit of Chinese people has not yet been removed, and they are called Yi, one of the "Four Barbarians," so they are called Bai Yi. And most people, of course, do not know of the existence of such people.</p>
<p>They live in the border area of Yunnan Province, mostly in the mountain valleys and streams between the continuous mountains. To the west, they adjoin Myanmar, and to the south, they border Annam. The Water Bai Yi mostly live by the water, and the Dry Bai Yi live entirely on the mountains.</p>
<p>The Water Bai Yi, who live by the water, have very fair and delicate complexions, and are leisurely and isolated, growing alone in the tranquil and elegant landscape paintings of the beautiful nature. People are especially detached and carefree. The bamboo forest by the water rustles, ceaselessly playing celestial music in the gentle southern breeze. Here, dense bamboo forests are everywhere. The houses of the Bai Yi people are not like our tall and heavy gray earth houses, but are all bamboo buildings built with bamboo. Below the mountains and above the water, rows of bamboo buildings are extremely harmonious with the natural landscape. When the wind sweeps through the mountains and forests and the blue waves, their bamboo buildings seem to dance lightly, as leisurely as living bamboo clumps and grasses, making people feel inexplicably cheerful.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Moving, like the overflowing spring tide, like the free-flowing blue waves, spreading and surging.</p>
<p>The bamboo buildings are divided into two floors, and the exterior is very delicate and lovely. The upper floor is inhabited by the Bai Yi, and although it is simple, it is exceptionally plain and natural. They are particularly particular about cleanliness. Before and after meals, a basin of clean cold water must be placed on the table, and they must wash their hands before eating. The chopsticks are local bamboo chopsticks, and they are discarded after each use, with new ones replaced each time. This is very similar to the customs of civilized people; however, the lower floor of the bamboo building is entirely a den for livestock, raising various kinds of domestic animals, with animal manure and weeds scattered everywhere. The upper and lower floors are two completely different worlds.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, the people of Yunnan have regarded them as barbarians, not intermarrying with them, and rarely interacting with them. Of course, it is very difficult to find those who speak Chinese and know Chinese characters; however, the Chinese are afraid of going far, and gradually they are more fluent in foreign languages such as English and French. Their clothing has also become increasingly Westernized, and they are much more modern than the Yunnan people who call them barbarians. Many women are as Westernized as those fashionable women in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Foreign missionaries not only come to cities with convenient transportation to spread the gospel of God, but their footprints can also be found in the dwellings of the Bai Yi, which are so remote that even we Chinese people do not know about them.</p>
<p>Therefore, those near Myanmar are more assimilated by the British, and those near Annam are more assimilated by the French. Everything is Yi but Westernized, and they are even more distant from the owner of the Chinese begonia leaf.</p>
<p>They love singing and dancing the most. Although the musical instruments are simple and the dances are mostly of the rough-line type, their innocence, liveliness, and natural enthusiasm are extremely capable of expressing their unique national character. However, the influence of Western forces is becoming more and more pervasive, and even singing and dancing are becoming more Westernized.</p>
<p>Mountain songs are very intoxicating folk poems of the Bai Yi people. When I traveled through the bamboo forests of the Bai Yi, although I did not know their meaning, the especially light, clear, sincere, and natural tones were very pleasant to hear. Now is the time of the scorching heat of summer in the big cities, and recalling the mountains and waters of the clear, cool, and refreshing Bai Yi places makes people naturally intoxicated in the dreams of memory.</p>
<p>The Dry Bai Yi have a less leisurely life than the Water Bai Yi. They all live in the mountains, and their products are not as abundant as those of the Water Bai Yi, so they have developed a very hardworking nature and a spirit of life that is completely different from that of modern society. Their national character is not as barbaric as the Chinese call them Yi. Their population accounts for about one-tenth or two-tenths of Yunnan, but they are all "Westernizing." Although they live on the edge of the Chinese begonia leaf, they are gradually changing color, and are still unknown to the owner of the Chinese begonia leaf.</p>
<h3>Women</h3>
<p>— Zhen Huan</p>
<p>It's getting dark!</p>
<p>The vast twilight brings a deepening gloom.</p>
<p>Knife-scarred A Lin staggered out of the small tavern by the sharp bend, where he had bought cigarettes and filled his belly with hot "Green Bean Brew." His two heavy, limp legs struggled to support his crooked upper body, swaying and dragging his unsteady, sluggish steps. The sparse streetlights, one after another, emitted faint light, the darkness often causing him to brush against the low eaves of the houses.</p>
<p>Turning a corner and passing through the Jin Family Archway, he would be at the edge of the city. In the lonely, desolate outskirts, covered with a withered yellow straw roof, that was his home!</p>
<p>"Open the door!" he called out in a hoarse voice:</p>
<p>"Oh! Is that Uncle A Lin?" a delicate, clear voice of a woman squeezed through the door crack:</p>
<p>Then, with a creak, the door opened! A Lin, carrying a fiery, strong smell of "Green Bean Brew," rushed in with the night wind.</p>
<p>"Oh dear, the lamp almost blew out!" the woman's voice was as weak as a soft catkin:</p>
<p>"Th... Thank you, Sister-in-law," A Lin's tongue felt sluggish and strange. His drunken eyes, filled with red veins, rolled over the woman's loosely buttoned cotton jacket, and an unavoidable, base thought swirled in his confused mind like a rising wave.</p>
<p>"This woman is quite pretty!" A smile, sparingly, slipped across the corner of his mouth, but after a moment, as if remembering something, he fell silent!</p>
<p>(A faint shadow, like a wisp of distant rosy clouds, floated past. In a certain year when he was accustomed to a leisurely life wandering around Xinglong Town, during the flowering of the pomegranates, he met Big-eyed Shun Sheng, who had come from × Port to escape trouble, and his young wife. Because they were both secretly engaged in smuggling, the two of them knelt before the Bodhisattva, lit three thin incense sticks, and kowtowed loudly. - Of course, Shun Sheng's young wife addressed A Lin as "Brother" and respected him as "Sister-in-law." But Shun Sheng, that unlucky fellow, had his business exposed and was arrested by men sent from the magistrate's office, who put him in shackles. The county magistrate tried him for one year and eight months. But this woman, in the end, under A Lin's righteous attitude, was taken into his home. The people in the town all praised A Lin for being a man of honor and loyalty!)</p>
<p>"Ah! Uncle A Lin, you're drunk again!" The light from the woman's lamp shone on A Lin's flushed face, which was in a trance.</p>
<p>"Heh... drunk again, good Sister-in-law, I... A Lin misses you so much!" A Lin's lips trembled, causing his entire body to shiver violently!</p>
<p>"What's this! Uncle A Lin, are you talking nonsense in your drunken stupor?" The woman panicked, her eyes widening in surprise.</p>
<p>"Good Sister-in-law, I'm not talking nonsense in my drunken stupor! I want to have some fun with you!"</p>
<p>"Humph! You should think about your Brother!"</p>
<p>"Oh! Shun Sheng? He's in jail! Good... Sister-in-law, you... agree, won't you!" A Lin's arms lunged toward the woman's chest like lightning.</p>
<p>"Help...!" The lamp in the woman's hand was smashed on the ground, her two tender, plump arms were tightly gripped by A Lin! Overwhelmed by the authority of violence and contempt, she wearily succumbed to A Lin's panting movements!</p>
<p>The lamp, knocked over by A Lin's arm onto a pile of dry straw, at this moment, the thick and thin, lively, golden snake-like flames, immediately spread throughout the house.</p>
<p>Terror awakened A Lin's confused intoxication! He didn't care about the body beside him that had suffered cruel manipulation, and at the same time he abandoned the approaching death, braving the thick smoke and fleeing!</p>
<p>Poor woman, she was half-paralyzed in a coma, as if her soul had disappeared! In an instant, she was engulfed in the melody of the raging fire, crackling and sizzling as she burned into a black mass!</p>
<p>The next day, news of A Lin's death spread throughout the town, and the scene of the fire was crowded with people, but they all forgot that the corpse was Shun Sheng's young wife!</p>

<p>The smoke swirls, shrouding the curtained room. The moon is hazy, its light dim and yellow. A misty, misty Xiao Xiang Lodge. A bleak, bleak few windows with emerald silk. A whistling, whistling thousand bamboo canes. Green, green several slender crabapple branches. A weary, weary, melancholy woman. Cold and lonely, two small plum blossoms.

Her eyebrows furrowed, furrowed, furrowed, her eyebrows filled with hatred. Quietly, quietly, she sits on the Xiang Fei couch. Softly, softly, she leans on the ivory bed. A dimly, dimly lit, half-burnt candle. A cold, icy, half cup of decocted medicine. Pitiable, panting. Her heart wavering. Coughing sounds. Tears welling up. Blood stains moistening her thin silk skirt. Earnestly, earnestly, her feelings uneasy. Sighing again and again, her sighs mournful. Pitiful, leaving, leaving, separating from her homeland.

<p>Continuous wind and rain beat against the silk window. A young woman in her boudoir. The cuckoo cries sadly. Moved by her heart, tears welling up. Only to see that, the bright moon hangs in the sky, as clear as possible. Causing her to see the bright moon and feel even more heartbroken. All day long she misses her husband. Mournfully guarding the ivory bed. She hates her husband, how difficult it is to part with him. Saying that he would return home in less than half a year. Time passes easily, hiring people to grow old. A year alone in the quilt, doubly mournful. Surely you, by nature, are amorous and greedy for beautiful women. In brothels, you have made a new pair of amorous lovebirds. Soft jade and warm fragrance delay your future. Laughing happily all day, forgetting your wife. Or perhaps you have become acquainted with a woman of beautiful face and moonlike appearance, a woman of passionate feelings. Enjoying yourself in a foreign land. Nearly a year has passed without news. Few discuss the matters in my heart. I am diligent in household affairs morning and night. I miss my husband until the fifth watch every night. Spring breezes and autumn moons pass easily. When people grow old and their beauty fades, their hearts are most wounded. I am resentful that you have no thought of home. The joy of the boudoir is just a dream. Do not mention good flowers and a full moon. The flowing water heartlessly secretly wounds itself. I, when I think of sad things. I am even more heartbroken in the sound of the wind and rain. The cuckoo cries continuously, filled with hatred.</p>

<h3>Fragments from Diantong</h3>
<p>Yuan Muzhi's "Cityscape" will gather all the characteristics of the city, and pay more attention to civic sports. The other day, on the French Republic Memorial Day, a temporary location team was formed to go to the French Park to capture the lanterns, arches and the marching crowds in front.</p>
<p>The Diantong basketball team had a friendly match with the Shanghai Magnesium team at the Yanshupu Road Fire Brigade cement court, resulting in a score of 21 to 16, with Diantong winning.</p>
<p>Miss Wang Ying recently bought many exquisite sofa beds, writing desks, etc., and has moved into the Diantong actress dormitory.</p>
<p>Diantong photographer Yang Longming has a deep understanding of photochemistry. He also arranges the lighting very appropriately on the set on weekdays. It is expected that the photography of "Freedom God" will have very good results.</p>
<p>Shi Chao, a newcomer in "Freedom God," has achieved such results on his first time on the silver screen, and Diantong attaches great importance to him.</p>
<h3>Further News on the Re-performance of "Nora"</h3>
<p>In the re-performance of "Nora," because Wei Heling, who played the role of Dr. Nan Hai, returned to his hometown due to his mother's illness, the role has now been invited to be played by Zheng Junli of Lianhua Company. Zheng has always been extremely cautious in his acting. In addition to stepping up rehearsals, he immediately discusses the personality of Nan Hai and his position in the play with others whenever he has time. In the future performances, the acting is bound to have a unique place. It is also heard that after the last public performance, many people from the academic community wrote to say that the ticket prices were too high, and they were unable to appreciate it. This time, a special kind of low-priced ticket for the academic community is set up to make up for the regrets of the last time. The location of the public performance has been decided as Lake Society, and the date has been decided as the 21st of this month. Seat tickets have now begun to be sold. Simalu Modern Bookstore, Shanghai Magazine Company, China Magazine Company, Lequn Magazine Company, Times Bookstore, and Xiahui Road Women's Bookstore are all acting as agents.</p>
<h3>Fragments from Lianhua</h3>
<p>Cai Chusheng's new work after "New Woman," the script has been completed and will be sent to Beijing for registration soon. The male lead is set to be Zheng Junli and Ge Zuo, and the female lead is planned to be played by Li Zhuozhu.</p>
<p>The "Wild Goose" song sung by Wang Renmei in her recent work "Little Angel" has been recorded by Baidai Company with excellent results.</p>
<p>Ma Xuwibang's "Wild Geese Descending on the Cold River" is working extremely intensely. This play stars Chen Yanyan, so Chen has been extremely busy on the set recently.</p>
<p>Lianhua's sound film "Waves Washing Sand" this year is set to star Jin Yan and Zhang Zhizhi. Screenwriter and director Wu Yonggang is now working on the scenes, and will be going to Qingdao to capture location shots in the near future.</p>
<p>Wan Zuozhi, the protagonist of "Little Angel," and Yin Xiucen, the fattest man in China, are learning to swim. Ge could not swim, so he laid prone on Yin's back, his form resembling a monkey riding an elephant across the river in "Tarzan Couple."</p>
<p>A secret screening of "The Great Road" has taken place. According to viewers' news: "This film is more realistic than the previously sensational 'Humanity,' depicting human love to its peak. There is no doubt that it will win the sympathy of the general audience when it is released later."</p>
<h3>Li Keng's "Old Man" Song</h3>
<p>Since "Goddess," our little star Li Keng has not had any new works released, and his many viewers are naturally looking forward to it.</p>
<p>"The Great Road" is his recent work, and only one location shot is missing for the entire play to be completed successfully. Li Keng plays Zheng Junli in his childhood here. The plays he performed were all very important, and he achieved unprecedented success.</p>
<p>The film he is preparing to star in is "Childhood China," which is a long-promoted children's epic. This film is entirely dialogue and singing, and is directed by Fei Mu.</p>
<p>Because he was filming a sound film, Li Keng had already learned Mandarin very well. Now he has also hired a teacher to start learning to sing. Recently, Baidai Company has recorded the "Old Man" song into a record, and this record will be published soon. We believe this record will be very popular.</p>
<h3>The Protagonist of "Cityscape" is the Young Tang Na</h3>
