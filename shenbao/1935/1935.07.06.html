<h3>消弭東菲戰禍　英積極外交行動　時局關鍵繫於法國態度　阿王請干涉陷美於窘境　非戰公約又遇一試金石</h3>
<p>（巴黎）賴伐爾總理今日復與英國大使會談意阿爭端、據外交方面傳出消息、英政府對於阿比西尼亞問題、已在各國京城採取外交行動云、（四日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）路透社探悉意阿爭案之重心、現已移至巴黎、英國刻正以國聯會員之資格、根據其集體的義務向怯探詢、英國之政策、似不閃避其義務、惟其他有關係之各國如拒絕分荷担負、則英國亦不欲獨負全責、衆信英國决不能援引國聯盟約第十六條發起對侵略國實施經濟制裁之計畫、英國現方努力阻止東北菲戰事之發作、而表明衆不能盼望英國獨負在進行中似將發生之任何危險、任何行動非先商諸自治領、决不實施、諸問題之須審愼考慮者、其一爲阿比西尼亞戰事所將及於菲洲他部之可能的彩饗、菲人現皆密切注視爭案談判之進行、法政府亦極注重阿比西尼亞問題、其願消弭戰禍之熱誠、不亞於英、聞法國之政策主張遠避國聯、因意國對於此事、劍　弩張、稍一不愼易觸其怒也、惟仍將竭力藉直接談判取解决之方法、但今須知者、從容討論之時期行將窮盡、（五日路透電）</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞京城此間今日得悉、阿比西尼亞政府已向美國請求、考慮如何可以强迫意國遵守凱洛格公約之方法、此項請求聞係交由此間美國代辦亨森、轉達華盛頓云、（四日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）國務院今日表示接得阿比四尼亞之請求干涉意阿爭端、因美意阿三國皆爲凱洛公約之簽字國也、按今日官方曾否認接得此項請求、現雖已有此宣布、但當局仍不願作何批評、（四日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）據今日此間政界消息、阿比西尼亞國王昨以請願文致駐阿美代辦、請美國對於意阿爭議援用凱洛格非戰公約一節、國務總理赫爾將極審愼考慮覆文、消息靈通各界感覺此文已陷美國於甚窘之地位、若覆文拒絕此請、則將爲人認爲閃避公約義務、若美國援引該約、則極易與意國發生糾紛、美國鑒於前兩次援用該約均無效果、故衆　美國唯一可能的行動、厥爲宣布美國不承認以武力兼併士地、如對「滿洲國」一案之所爲、（五日路透電）</p>
<h3>麥唐納說明　英國外交政策　始終信守國聯盟約義務　和平事業端賴國際合作</h3>
<p>（倫敦）樞密大臣麥唐納頃發表無綫電廣播演說、答覆外間對於政府外交政策之種種批評、略謂、「目前國際形勢、難以樂觀、余知之甚審、然其責固不僅在一國之政府、一國政府斷不能强制其餘各國政府之行動、一般批評政府外交政策者、往往不加審察、、其意若謂世界各國除英國外、均無行動自由、英國可强令怯德意日等國服從其意志、而一切和平事業、則可僅由吾人獨力以成之、苟然則豈不謬乎、英國政府在國聯會·及巴黎·羅馬·斯特萊薩歷次談判、態度光明、凡志願恊助和平創造之選民、均無不贊成此種政策、吾英國政府對外行動、顯示維護和平之决心、已不止一端、而薩爾問題之解决、尤爲其最明顯之一例、吾人始終信守國聯會會員國之義務、且承認應與美國密切合作、凡所以促進世界和平者、吾人過去已盡力爲之、今後　當更盡力以爲之」云云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>倫敦官塲表示　經濟封鎖尚談不到</h3>
<p>（倫敦）羅馬及巴黎方面盛傳、意大利若堅欲向阿比西尼亞作戰、英國對竟將採取經濟封鎖之手段云云、唯據此間官塲今夜宣稱、此種辦法現尙談不到云、（五日國民電）</p>
<h3>英議員紛質問　艾登建議惹起反響</h3>
<p>（倫敦）最近不管部閣員艾登至羅馬時、曾吿意相墨索里尼、謂英國願以英屬索瑪里倫之地一隅割讓阿比西尼亞、使有通海出路、今日下院開會時、諸議員紛起質問、殖民大臣馬爾康麥唐納答稱、艾登試探的建議中所述之地、乃才拉港、長約五十哩、廣約十二哩而與阿境相接、其居民夏季約三千人、冬季約七千人、腹地無固定之居民、僅游牧之部落按時前往耳、旋保守黨議員彼得麥唐納請政府於重提此試探的建議時、應先嚴重考慮帝國各處部落民衆所將發生之惶恐、全院聞之大爲歡迎、殖民大臣於是又追述艾登之建議附有凡英國割讓與意阿兩國之任何土地、英屬各部落應享有其上之水草權、議員繼起質問者接續不斷、後由議長斐資羅發言制止始已、（四日路透電）</p>
<h3>英欲借重於法　對東歐約不復反對</h3>
<p>（倫敦）據消息靈通人士所稱、一旦意國進攻阿比西尼亞、怯國若在日內瓦方面援助英國行動、則英國對於陸空軍備問題、準備考慮與法國成立妥協、現聞英國對於訂立東歐公約、已不復表示反對、惟對維持奧國獨立問題、則英國是否願負明確之義務、尙不可知云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>維持國聯威信　倫敦人士言論一致</h3>
<p>（倫敦）泰晤士報評論意大利興阿比西尼亞之現行爭端、以爲此案乃係「歐洲事件、自當由各關係國　照國聯會盟約所載各項原則、而由外交途徑圖謀解决、」幷無悲觀理由、特英怯兩國二月三日倫敦宣言書所規定之稈序、已因意國對於阿比西尼亞國之威脅、而較爲難於實現耳、夫維持國聯會之威信、自屬當務之急、但菲洲英屬怯尼亞·索謀里蘭。及蘇丹三處邊境地帶、英國所有利益與夫英國在埃及所處地位、亦當同時加以顧慮云云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）孟却斯脫保衛報評論英國政府對於阿比西尼亞問題之政策、謂以國聯會會員國之資格而論、英國雖當担任集體義務、但其本身並無單獨義務、「至以英國人民而言、必須他國均能履行會員國之義務、英國乃可有所作爲、英國政府若出以單獨行動、决非人民所能贊同、」或謂「時局關鍵係　巴黎、」爲此言者殆以防止戰禍之責諉諸法國、實則各國外交策略、無論結果如何、而阿比西尼亞問題仍當由國聯會加以討論也」云云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）國聯會協會頃在劍橋開會、對意阿爭端問題一度奔議後、决議敦促內閣採用最嚴峻之措施、以維持和平、及保持國聯會處理國際爭端之最上威權、（四日哈瓦斯　）</p>
<h3>法國方面態度　祇須不礙意法友誼　任何建議均願考慮</h3>
<p>（巴黎）英國大使克拉克爵士、於本日午後拜會賴伐爾總理、按英國內閣昨日曾討論阿比西尼亞問題、克拉克與賴伐爾會晤、當與此項問題有關、外交界人士指出法國亟欲覓得和平解决意阿爭端之辦法、賴伐爾總理曾在日內瓦宣稱、任何建議足以解决意阿爭端、只須不至妨害意怯友誼者、渠無不樂向意國提出云、法國此種態度現在仍無變更、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國政府向法國交涉、謀於必要時由英法共同行動、向國聯會要求經濟制裁、以解决意阿爭端、此間意國方面人士認爲英國此項交涉、僅係一種外交手段、英國眞正政策並不在此、英國輿論最近多鼓吹維護國聯會之權威、英國內閣態度多半係受此項輿論之影饗、意國方面人士並以爲法國决不至贊成對意國採取非友誼的政策、英國之舉勤至多不過向輿論表示、英國政府已盡其力所能爲、以維持和平而已、且卽令英國封鎖蘇彝士運河、意國亦不難覓得外國船隻、裝運意國軍隊及軍火以至東菲云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>意法締有軍事盟約</h3>
<p>（倫敦）晨報數家今日登載意阿爭議事、謂怯國未必依允對干意國適用制裁條文、因怯國新近與意簽定條約、附有協定書、准意國在阿比西尼亞有自由行動權、並聲明怯國在鐵路區域外對阿無利益關係也、此項法意協定、在實質上等於軍事盟約、使怯意參謀部得以大减其邊境之防軍、故法意邊界軍力極薄、意軍儘可自由調赴菲洲、（五日路透電）</p>
<h3>紅海法屬島讓與意</h3>
<p>（巴黎）據英國報紙載稱、法國政府以紅海中法屬杜美拉島讓與意國、該島本係怯屬索謀里倫與意屬愛里德里之交界、最近法國參謀總長甘茂林將軍游歷羅馬時、曾將該島讓與意國云、據怯國負責方面宣稱、該島係於本年一月七日讓與意國、與法意協定中之殖民地協定及最近兩國間之軍備談話、均無關係云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法報譏英政策矛盾</h3>
<p>（巴黎）法國報紙現批評英國對於意阿爭執之態度、謂英國前不願用國聯盟約、以制裁德國、今乃對於意阿爭議、突欲援用盟約、何前後矛盾乃爾、巴黎迴聲報載裴爾隄那一文、謂英國以國聯生死所繫之事件訴諸國聯、其旨趣在防衛菲洲邊境、而非歐洲邊境、如法國不智加入此種担任、則意國將引希特勒爲同志矣云、急進社會派工作報謂英國之擁護國聯盟約與制裁條文、殊足令人驚異、蓋距今不久英國曾簽定英德海軍條約、而破壞凡爾賽和約也、該報又謂、怯總理賴伐爾必不捨棄意國云、（五日路透電）</p>
<h3>仲裁委會開會　聆取意代表之聲辯</h3>
<p>海牙意阿爭端　合仲裁委員會、於昨日開會時、聽取意大利代表萊沙奈敎授之聲辯、萊氏要求委　會規定日期時間及地點、俾意方召集曾目擊或親聆華爾華爾事件之土著蹬人、到會陳述當時情形、所有證人、將以飛機載往南歐指定地點、仲裁委員會委員將卽赴該處聆取證辭、然後再折回施威寗根繼續開會云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>意報痛斥英國</h3>
<p>（羅馬）意國報紙經過兩星期之沉默後、今日復向英國痛事攻擊、「意大利報」社評中稱、英國係在經濟及政治雙方宣傳、以謀完全佔領阿此西尼亞、一般人以爲反英之評論旣如此其多、大概首相墨索里尼禁止意報攻擊英國之命令、業已取消矣、（四日國民電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）意大利報紙本日複登載評論、抨擊英國對阿比西尼亞問題之態度、晚郵報謂、英國欲仗義執言、以挽救公道正義、其實際固如此乎、英國經略阿比西尼亞、處心積慮已非一日、最初則謀壟斷查那湖之水利、繼復在阿國干貝拉區域、設立英國貿易根據地、甚至設關征稅、建設公路、以獨佔該地之白金礦開採權、最初英國財圑曾設立阿比西尼亞銀公司、致引引起一九二九年之阿國金融風潮、目前英人復在阿國設立一地產公司、以期壟斷查那湖週圍士地之開發權、蓋阿國對於外國勢力侵入、曾百方阻難、嗣後英國許與阿國政府以種種讓步、並允許援助阿國國防、該公司之創立、乃始獲得阿國政府之接受由是則英國所謂維持公道、其用心亦不難槪見矣云云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）意阿兩國他日發生衝突時、英國擬經由國聯會而以經濟制裁手叚、對付意大利一項問題、此間輿論已有所顧慮、巴達諾郵報載稱、「此係英國對於意大利一種威脅、萬難成爲事實、」意大利日報載稱、「經濟封鎖、非用武力不能實行、英國所由以國聯爲後盾者、其目的僅爲本國利益設一屏藩、以事掩飾、俾克逐漸獨占阿比西尼亞領土、蓋此項獨占行動、幷已開始矣、」意大利郵報于申述英國在阿國境內種種活動之後、發出結論云、「英國對阿比西尼亞之雄圖、突因意大利之行動、而爲之揭發無餘、且因而受有極大之障礙、世人當知英國在財政上給予阿比西尼亞之援助、阿國業已接受、而用爲軍事經費矣」云云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>柏林談話結果　德波維持親善關係　檢討歐洲一般問題　雙方意見大體一致</h3>
<p>（柏林）德國與波蘭去年宣佈友誼後、東歐事態因以安定、今爲更臻親善起見、波蘭外長貝克乃應德政府之請來游柏林、今日與德元首希特勒晤談、此爲兩國當道在採行友好政策後之第一次會見、衆料波蘭對於英德海軍協定之影響、未免稍覺不安、故欲得關於此項恊定在德國波羅的海政策上有何影響之保證、具克與希特勒談四小時後、發出一文、表示會晤時曾和平討論此問題、及與歐洲大局有關如俄法互助恊定等等之其他事伴、貝克聲稱、此次談話、乃一九三四年宣言之積極貢獻、去年宣言已成維持和平之要素云、德政府公報稱、雙方以坦白精神進行談話、彼此頗多同意之處云、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>照例發表公報</p>
<p>（柏林）官方昨晚發表文吿稱、波蘭外長貝克留此兩日、使希特勒總理及德政府官員得與開誠討論之機會、所討論者係與德波二國及一般歐洲政策有關之問題、雙方意見大體上已告一致、茲並確定一九三四年一月二十六日之德波宣言、不僅大有造於兩國之相互關係、且成爲維護歐洲和平之建議的要素、無任榮幸、貝克外長復鄭重表示、五月二十一日希特勒總理關於波蘭之宣言、及其對於德波協定永存不渝之期望、已引起波蘭方面之共鳴、波蘭茲亦切望對德善鄰關係之日進無疆、兩政府深知兩國接壤、將繼續維持密切之關係、並以全力促進歐洲之和平云、（四日國民電）</p>
<p>兩國諒解範圍</p>
<p>（柏林）波蘭克與希特勒元首談話之際、對於任何國、尤其是對於蘇聯與怯國、似未計擬何項敵對計劃、關於但澤自由市及波蘭走廊兩項問題、貝克上校並無鮮明表示、據波蘭方面消息、波蘭對於歐洲現行疆界、仍主張維持現狀、不願有所更張、至德國重整軍備之舉、旣由英德海軍協定予以認可、波蘭人士因而爲之極度不安、貝克上校聞曾向希特勒元首要求保證、謂在任何情勢之下、均當維持海上交通之自由、然則波德兩國諒解之眞實範圍、不難推測而知、卽兩國間具有恒久性之現行懸案、不因此項談話而有所損益、雙方談話結果、僅約定對于此項問題當會同覓求和平解决方案而已云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎深切注意</p>
<p>（巴黎）波蘭外長貝克上校與德國元首希特勒談話內容、力守秘密、各報均加以注意、「日報」因貝克上校拒絕接見法國各報記者、特表示抗議、謂「貝克上校向德國各報記者所發表之宣言、頗爲含混、令人不可捉摸、由是則貝克與希特勒之會晤、其性質之重大、固不宜誇張、然亦不能估量過低、」晨報則謂、雙方談話雖無具體結果、但就波蘭立塲而論、貝克上校此行之成就、當屬重要、」埃克西有報載稱、「貝克所發表之宣言用意深長、就外交界人士之印象、認爲係針對法國而發、」著名政論家多美松則在斐加洛報發表一文、評論和約修改問題、其言曰、「第三帝國今雖視德波同盟有利於彼、然究能歷若干時日、則非吾人所可知者矣、」（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>波報表示欣慰</p>
<p>華沙波蘭各報對於柏林方面歡迎外長貝克之熱誠、表示滿意、多謂波外長訪問柏林、於十八世紀後尙爲第一次、可見此舉實爲東歐新時代出現之佐證、各報對於希特勒親應貝克之歡宴、尤為欣慰、波蘭日報於社平中聲稱、見克外長此行之結果已充分證明德波不侵犯條約所造之良好關係、有增無减、絕無悲觀之成分、波蘭快報云、波蘭外長今次於拍林所受之優遇、設於二年以前、未必有此可喜之結果也、另有軍事機關之報紙聲稱、貝克之使命不僅於德波關係上極爲重要、且與全歐局面亦有極大影響、觀於德報所發表之公報、可見貝克此行之目的、實已完全達到、又有一報以爲兩國見解、經此一度交換、更見融洽一致云、（五日國民電）</p>

<p>（南京）蘇聯駐日大使優列尼夫氏於五日午後三時二十分至外務訪廣田外相、達二小時半、關於曾由蘇聯方面提出所謂越境事件之抗議問題及滿蘇國境共同委員會之設立問題等等、行使重要會商、優列尼夫大使於會見時、據謂根據本國政府之回訓、曾於前月二十六日在廣田優列尼夫會見當時、由廣田外相提議設立滿蘇國境糾紛處理之委員會案、蘇聯政府答覆承認此項提議、惟對於今後之折衝方怯及其具體方案、當由蘇聯政府充分考慮、甚望日本方面亦當加以研究云、廣田外相對此諒解蘇聯政府贊成設立國境委員會之趣旨、卽將此案通知「滿洲國」面、關於折衝方法、須充分商妥、業經如此答覆矣、五日之會見關於設立國境委員會之開始交涉時期及其交涉地點、尙未談及、但今後日滿蘇三國對於上項折衝方怯充分商妥之後、擬卽從速開始交涉、其步驟大致如此、至優列尼夫大使於五日會見之際、對於曾由蘇聯提出所謂日軍越境問題、毫未接觸、前電有誤特此註明、（五日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）駐滿大使南次郞五日報吿外務省、謂日滿官憲奉外務省訓令後、極力進行調查日滿軍越境事件眞相、然如蘇俄政府抗議中所謂、日滿兵士越境及軍艦侵犯俄等、全非事實、蘇俄故意宣傳此種事件、並對日政府提出抗議、其用意在何、殊難諒解、或計國境共同委員會設立問題、情形有利、亦未可知（五日日聯電）</p>

<p>機製國貨工廠聯合會、以中國酒精廠狂跌售價、陷害同業、呈請中央民運會實業部請求制止、原文云、中國國民黨中央執行委員會、民衆運動指導委員會、國民政府實業部鈞鑒、頃據美龍酒精廠·中華酒精廠·夏光酒精廠·等聯名函稱、查酒精向屬舶來品、自民國十三年美龍酒精廠開始製造、始有國貨、然亦僅製少數、供自用而已、直至二十二年冬、始擴大製造、每日可出酒精一千五百加倫、而中華酒情廠亦於同年成立、每日可出酒精六百加倫、夏光酒精廠於二十三年春成立、每日可出酒精三百至四百加倫、原料均採用國內農產品、至於酒精售價、每加倫自一元五角至一元六角、其成本在八角至一元二角之間、除各種特別費用外、尙可少沾微利、而敝廠等對於售價、向抱和衷共濟之旨、互相維持、乃自二十三年三月間、實業部准中國酒精廠之請、通令蘇浙皖三省區內不准再設酒精工廠、藉資維護、其已成立之工廠、須就原有生產量製造、不准再事擴充產量、以免無謂之兢爭、並限一個月內呈部登記、過期槪作後立工廠論、同年三月二日、社會局登載新申兩報佈吿、會字第二四二號、限制已成立之各廠、其生產額以原有產量爲限、不得再事擴充等因、各在案、敝廠等亦次第</p>
<p>遵令登記</p>
<p>惟二十柜年八月間、外商遠東酒精廠及太平洋酒精廠、先後成立、生產量一爲四百加侖、一爲五百加侖、設在租界內、未向實業部登記、且已過規定登記之期、而中國酒精廠爲華僑所創辦、旅外已久、不知祖國情形、起先出品、（於本年三月間）每加侖售一元五角、其實暗盤爲一元四角、迄今未滿二月、一再跌價、現每加侖僅售九角八分至九角六分、暗盤實售八角五分、此種搗亂市面之舉動、雖外國傾銷辦怯、亦無若此之懸殊與迅速、以致夏光中華兩酒精廠、被迫停工、現美龍廠亦受相當損害、卽中國廠自身、亦感虧折影響、查該廠產額、本爲四千加侖、現已增至七千加侖、並在報端實傳、每日將有一萬五千加侖之生產、按上所述、該廠不但欺朦同業、跌價搗亂市面、抑且違背政府公吿之限制、恣意大量生產、啟國貨同業無謂之競爭、祝該廠製造原料、舍國內農產品不用、反而仰給於外貨之糖蜜、尤爲對於政府提倡國貨、救濟農村之原則、大相悖謬、値此農村破產、工商凋疲、外國</p>
<p>傾銷政策</p>
<p>虔視耽耽之秋、而該廠絕無進展實業之遠謀、徒恃資力雄厚、併吞國貨同業、反使國內之外國酒精廠、造成立足機會、言之至堪痛心、敝廠等迫不得已、瀝述詳情、聯合環請貴會、以國貨集團之立塲、作中流砥柱之措置、俾我酒精工業不致同歸於盡、母任翹企仰望之至、　情到會、查現在酒精之消費量、統計本外埠用於工業醫藥燃料者最多、每日三千介侖、租界內作飮料者、約一千介侖、共計銷數每日僅四千加侖、按照各廠生產統計、產銷兩額、相差過鉅、國貨酒精廠之失敗、將成事實、按中國酒精廠創辦之初、旣泰實業部通令各酒精廠、須一律限期登記、並不准再事擴充產量、以免無謂之競爭、社會局登報公吿、亦有同樣之主張、則中國酒精、一再擴充產量、一再狂跌售價、故陷同業於停頓、蔑視通令如弁髦、殊屬非國貨酒精業前途之福、本會鑒於國內工商業、正在風雨飄搖中、難安緘默、理合據情電呈鈞會部、迅賜召集各該酒精廠到部、垂詢實在情形、或將產量售價、援照原案、予以切實限止、以免無謂之競爭、而弭同業之惡感、或另籌統制之方策、俾維酒精業於永固、不勝仰賴之至、</p>
<p>民運會批</p>
<p>民運會一零三九三號批答云、呈爲中國酒精廠擴充產量、狂跌售價、故陷同業於停頓、請轉令制止由、世代電悉、已函實業部查核辦理矣、仰卽知照、此批、</p>
<p>實業部批</p>
<p>工字一二七五二號批答云、代電一件、爲轉據美龍酒精廠等函請設法制止中國酒精廠增加產量、及狂跌售價由、世代電悉、業經據情飭知中國酒精廠、本同業互助之旨、會同該會與各酒精廠、商榷進行、仰通知各廠會集恊商、並將商榷情形、具報、此批、</p>

<h3>特載　劉海粟報告歐遊經過（七）</h3>
<p>二·此次播揚藝學增高中國國際地位：——短見者流，天天只在希望出個好外交家，能够拿些從橫椑圖怎樣神通靈敏的手段，就可以使中國國際地位增高，這眞是夢想！中國現在是一個貧乏到極端的民族，這是歐人所深知的，歐洲人的成見，就以爲中國的現象是：共產黨的搗亂，經濟破產，盜匪綁票，政治黑暗，文化落後，水旱天災等！他們除了要使用經濟侵略的計劃以外，對於中國的輕視已非一日了。我們的所謂外交家，在國際上那裏有什麽「地位，所以也不能駡他們不敢說話，此非人的問題，乃惡劣之環境使然也。要使中國國際地位增高，對於各項問題之圖謀解决，固然要緊，而對於中國文藝復興運動尤爲急要。因爲近代歐洲各民族的發展，無一不是先經過偉大的藝術運動與思想運動的。現在稱强世界的各國，同時也是近代文化發達的各民族。如法，英，俄，德，意諸國。當他們的國力尙未展開以前，在先，終是有許多偉大的思想家與藝術家本着百折不回的精神從事偉大的思想運動和藝術運動以鼓起大衆獨立堅强的人格，和獨立不懼的發展。因爲偉大的藝術家和思想家實爲一民族之靈魂。從此次在各國展畫而引起各國人之尊崇中國民族，可以證之。一九三四年二月十一日「德國前途」報所刋批評撮要復述之因爲顯然代表着最多數覜衆的意見：「……我第一次，旣無目錄又無說明者，毫無準備地徘徊於此精美畫林之中，足有三小時，我只覺得倘怳迷離於一環夢之中。宇宙裏竟還有這樣更高尙而優秀的世界，較之我們更爲高尙與靜潔。猶如一百二十年前我們的大詩人與大美術家之理想國一樣。這種智慧的民族，現在竟還有一般強蠻持武力之國家，確乎飛擲着炸彈而設法殘忍之。但是他依然活着而且很幸福地存在着。我希望到中國去，伴此具有無上和諧聰明的人，學其一切，而以其精妙之繪畫向人說述…第二次我伴著一位旣未研究又非畫家如我者的鄉間女子，可是她也有感受性與精微的感覺，他與我有同樣的美麗的印象。第三次我逢着一個軍人，他也收藏着一切新的古的繪畫，他也與我同樣想而排外者，在此也開顏低首心悅誠服而接受他人，如何對此文化之邦拋擲炸彈，加以焚毀悔，頓悟，這樣超悅高尙的民族是不可侵侮的。……」又德國美術史家孔威廉博士，在柏林日報發表評論其中有一段也這樣虔誠地說：「……中國現在尙不得平靜偉大的中原　遭顚撲波折；千百年來盛傳的哲理，為之粉碎，西方的科學工業高唱着凱旋之歌·可是中國的靈魂不死，因爲繪畫是中國精神圾大創造之一，他始終保守着他自己所創造的特質，而且向前演進着，由其深長的根幹供給着養料使之水存而至於無窮。這也是中華民族的象徵……又中國現代畫展在英倫開會時，英人亦有數百篇批評，一九三五年三月三十日泰晤士報刋社論一篇　爲國際間所注目，茲亦節錄於次：（次完）</p>

<p>後市開盤八二二元七角、旋由二元九角逐步下游、大德成萬豐恒餘義豐永同裕潤脫手、退至一元、福興永慶發永滿恒努力維持、大起掙扎、入後印銀反小一一安那、恒餘福興永迎祥爭購、即漲到三元八角、恒餘迎祥大德成福興永趁高供條退爲二元半、福興永福泰永惠祥福妥日昌元茂永乾元永等紛紛爭購、更升至六元、福餘益餘鴻興恒昌永趁高售條、跌至四元七角、惟申豐福興永尙進、又五元升至六角、印銀二次勿動、此後徘徊於五元左右、涵恒略有脫手、降爲四六角、收盤爲八二四元八角、收市後平穩、徘徊於五元左右、查一天間最高價八二九元二角、最低價五八二一元、計有八元二角起仆、結果較前收又跌十元零一角、</p>

<h3>劃頭微見寬鬆</h3>
<p>拆息如故：銅元又長一千</p>
<p>昨銀洋市況、政府救濟貸欵已實行分配、難有數家因抵押品關係、沾潤至微、究以市場中驟增此大批頭寸、於金融現狀、不無少補、故形勢已漸呈寬鬆、而久未搖動之劃頭加水已逐步下游、微露懈怠、開盤即跌一角、改爲五角、終以四角五分收盤、較之前市已跌落一角五分矣、惟洋　方面穩定如故、早午兩市仍同爲一角、與前相同、拆票交易、早市轉賬二百四十餘萬、新交易五十餘萬、午市交易二十餘萬、小總會中交易八十餘萬、洋押欺交易取贖六十餘萬、新做出七十餘萬、鈔票收回一百六十餘萬、發出方面流通券八十餘萬、暗記券四十餘萬、各路滙欵六十餘萬、客路來源二—萬、去胃四十萬、銀行收解消息、外商銀行收票票欵一百六十餘萬、各種貨墊等雜欵收解三百二十餘萬、特種匯欵四十餘萬、外匯結欵九十餘萬、出倉四十萬、華商銀行收解票欵二百五十餘萬、各秤貨墊等雜狄收解三百九十餘萬特種匯欵五十餘萬、外匯結欵七十餘萬、進倉二十萬、日商銀行收解票狄二百五十餘萬、各種貨墊等雜狄收解三百四十餘萬、特種滙狄四十餘萬、外匯結欵八椒餘萬、進倉二十萬、錢莊洋公單收解三千五百餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解四百三椒餘萬、又江南小洋、早午市均仍爲八百三十元、與前日相同、交易方面、早午兩由均無聞、廣東小洋、早市會漲二角、開七百三十五元、午市改出五元、爲七百三十四元九角、故結果較前日跌三角、做出交易、早市二十二萬角、午市十四萬角、銅元又續長一千文、爲三百四十一千五百文、交易數額五萬一千二百二十五串文、合代價洋一萬五千元、又票據交換總數、銀元一千一百八十一萬六千四百三十六元三角一分、內計交換總數銀元四百八十五萬四千零二十一元二角、滙劃銀元四百六十六萬九千七百十元零六角七分、代收總數錢業二百二十六萬八千一百七十九元五角五分、外行一萬四千五百二十四元八角九分、</p>
<h3>證劵　債市在盤旋醞釀中</h3>
<p>散戶稍有供出　挫落角左右</p>
<p>昨華商證券交易所、因多空雙方之擯持、趨勢竟入盤旋、全日市況沉悶、市價盤旋於、三角之間、進出方面、比較散戶佻出較多、良以其在環境銀根變重牽制下、未免稍有怯意耳、趨勢前途恐尙須經過相常之醞釀也、昨日經過以上午開盤散戶供出頗多、各債影響挫落石分至三角許、次盤步調即未能一致、市價起伏、完令隨籌碼之供求、午市開盤、依然混沌、此起彼仆、極盡恍惚之能事、收盤因某帮略有結出、比較挫落爲多、綜計全日市價結果除九善微漲五分、餘均一致跌落半元左右、成交德額共八百、十萬元、茲將其高低結果、列比較表如左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>紗花　日商大辦棉花</h3>
<p>棉市續堅、七八月期趨勢愈挺、因多頭拉力頗强、軋空風說、異常濃烈、一般浮空、活動扒補、故近期獨堅、午後聞標金回跌、市勢略形鬆懈、不過日廠現棉需求大暢、</p>
<p>近月市態較俏</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、近月形勢頗緊、且多頭把持不放、檯面頗昂、報載魯省棉田受天旱之患、多數田畝未能播秤、損失極大、但又一消息、陜西棉產狀况良好、且邇來雨水調勻、生產尙佳、所以人心平常、結果各月均比上日收盤價漲五分至一角、午後開盤、七·八·月期趨勢殊挺、二盤發現高峰、但拍至三收盤、有一部分多頭出籠、市價回跌一角、結果七月期與上午收盤價同、遠跌一角半、查賣出賡豐四千八百擔、大孚一千一百擔、泰興一千二百擔、均昶二千八百擔、義成二千三百擔、長豐一千擔、潤康二千擔、長和一千四百擔、買進合興一千五百擔、大孚一千五百擔、愼記一千二百擔、潤康一千一百擔、信誠五千九百擔、長和一千七百擔、均昶痰千四百擔、生源一千三百擔、益康二千七百擔、源興昌一千六百擔、一日間圾高低價及收盤價如下、</p>
<p>原棉交易奇暢</p>
<p>現棉鎖費、漸形發展、日廠需要大為活躍、且各廠購辦幣續不絕、成交共計二千四百十三件、來源計姚花七〇〇包、</p>
<h3>本月紗多頭了結</h3>
<p>紗市續疲、局勢錯雜、人心未能定、但多數心理、對於市價、依然看跌、因日紗通行各方、售價較廉、華紗交易或受影響、惟邇來現紗銷路、益覺發展、華北一路、購辦日形起色、</p>
<p>金　又見軟落</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月均呈平定之象、但拍至二三盤、聞現紗交易較前爲少、且售價不動、人氣平靜、結果各約比上日收盤價微跌一二三四角、午後開盤形勢突落、因金市回小、長豐又來拋出、拍至二三槃、多頭在本月份了結、遠月帶挫、但新賣者未見踴躍、因現紗客帮成交中日紗仍有兩千餘包、結果近月比上午收盤價跌六四角、遠跌　二三角、查賣出大孚一千一百包、明德三百包、合興三百包、均昶九百包、泰昌四百包、長豐一千六百包、大昶四百五十包、買進益大四百包、長餘三百包、恒德五百包、益昶四百包、協成六百包、合興三百包、泰興四百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>
<p>紗路一千包強</p>
<p>現紗銷塲尙佳、查全日各帮買本統計一千零二十六包、行情與上日相仿、惟十支組紗獨俏、日紗成交一千餘包、行情略有參差、各帮買額如下、</p>
<p>天津　五八五　威海衛六〇　內地五五　汕頭五</p>
<p>廣東　二〇　蕪湖二〇　徐州三〇　厦門一〇</p>
<p>長沙　一五〇　南京一</p>
<h3>美棉停市英印再漲</h3>
<p>昨美棉因國慶節停市、英棉現貨漲二點、期貨漲一二點、印棉初因多頭獲利了結及歐洲出口商賣出而疲、後因期貨商與日商買進而昂、計</p>
<p>平果爾漲一羅比、奧姆辣漲〇·五至一·五羅比、白羅溪漲〇·七五至二·五羅比、原電錄左、（四日電）</p>
<h3>五日來華北紗銷大暢</h3>
<p>日紗估一萬包：華紗六七千包</p>
<p>自日紗有復入標準開拍消息以來、華北一路在本星期一至今日止、對於日紗大爲搜羅、購辦異常濃烈、據調查所得、共計約有一萬包之譜、其他帮採辦較少、行情棉紗飛漲三·四元、三十二支·四十二支綫價漲起五·六元、至於華紗銷塲、亦較前爲發展、銷去約有六七千包、天津幫買去華紗僅係組紗、就以上情形推測、存紗或可减縮、查查最近中外存紗量、爲六萬五千餘件云、</p>
<h3>糧食　粉麥不堪洋麥打擊</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、又呈極度不安、各月份成交暢旺、上下午之跌度、亦達二四分之巨、以洋麥報價、芝茄哥無市、坎拿大跌四五角不等又傳澳洲小麥、前日廠方曾成交二船、價康至四元四角九分、或傳說四角七分、且歐洲麥價、亦跌度甚猛、此種種原因、賣氣大暢、但有浮空抵補、及廠方之出檔、故半日中做六十餘萬包、迨至下午開盤、心更見不振、因謠傳洋麥定價又鬆、祗喊四元四角、是否續定、雖不能證實、惟有此喊價、拋戶力量、自然更盛、即大廠之拋貨、亦步步低壓、故遠期又落二分零、國內新麥上市無幾、洋麥又來傾銷、前途局面、振作恐又不易也、結果本月份較前日跌二分、八月份跌二分七厘半、九月份跌三分二厘半、十月份跌三分七厘半、十一月份跌四分、十二月份跌四分二厘半云、</p>
<p>昨期麥市面、上下午開盤、各月份均一致低疲、以洋麥報價、坎拿大跌四五角、利物浦則跌一元三五角之巨、報價旣一致大落、現洋麥之合價、又步步廉宜、由此推測、似乎國外之過剩、猶不减於前、傾銷我國、又所難免、因此市塲人心、均感不安、賣氣旣盛、市面亦：再下落、在國內水旱災荒之餘、有此景象、亦殊匪夾所思也、結果本月份跌三分、八月份跌六分、九十月份跌七分、現麥情形、車麥仍無做開、船麥微有見交、價低一二分、惟送廠居多、故少正式喊開、</p>
<p>加拿大小麥　七月三日　七月四日　上落</p>
<p>八月份　八二·五〇　八·二五　跌一·二五</p>
<h3>河下米昨見回漲　—洋米長江帮交易突旺—</h3>
<p>本米（滬南）昨日各帮來源計到蘇同帮四號、南港八號、靑角松泗四號、共十六號、（貨共三千餘石）銷塲因天陰人心稍安、本街稍有動辦、故形勢轉定、市色似有帶緊之象、至結果若蘇同粳價已見回起數分至角許、惟南港早稱以來源較多、薄稻以包胃停辦、僅呈平定之局、而觀後勢、倘或天雨、更有挺秀之望、餘如陰響元亦無榮辱、羊尖因絕貨已久、昨一朝上市、未免形勢占鮮、（滬北）來源十號左右、河下存船已稀、市上白粳去胃高料平淡、中次轉鮮、價形高貨定勢、中次見緊數分至一角、白元來貨仍有、零化不多、市形又小一二角、薄稻貨稀銷活、市價定立、</p>
<p>洋米昨市居定局、去路內地帮雖見停頓、而長江幫交易突旺、九江漢口各帮進胃均　南京去路亦佳、因長江方面遭受水災在市辦裝也、本街續有應酬、全日開出西貢七千包、小絞二千五百包、高貢碎米暹遇蘇更地等共計千餘包、總共仍有萬包以上之交易、故行情仍得站住、客秈則由內地辦去溫州機米二百包、</p>
<h3>安東餅市回軟　本埠豆餅漲風已殺</h3>
<p>昨日豆餅市况、（一）因天已轉陰、（二）爲大連餅續有拋出、安東餅市又回軟、致市氣轉變、但實需尙有問津、故市面站定、大勢轉入盤旋、統市計開輪海中餅一千片、牛莊黑餅三百片、路貨大速亦邊餅四千片、將貨大連光邊餅一千片、各廠四牌餅七千片、又七月照交八千片、又七天交一千片、</p>
<h3>絲茶　六月份紐約生絲存底調查</h3>
<p>今歲滬埠對外絲銷、以六月份最爲可觀、然紐約生絲銷用仍無起色、上月份紐約生絲鉗用較前月又减少四千六百三十三包、茲將六月紐約生絲存低報吿列左、</p>
<p>類別　進口　消用　存底</p>
<p>日本絲　三八、〇〇二三三、一三一　三九、六六六</p>
<p>歐洲絲　三九〇　三七一　五三九</p>
<p>上海絲　五九二　二二　一、四五八</p>
<p>廣東絲　—　—　三四六</p>
<p>俄國絲　—　一五</p>
<p>共計絲　三八、九八四　三三、七二八　四二、〇一八</p>
<h3>綠茶銷路尚稱不惡</h3>
<p>昨日綠茶銷路仍暢、路莊縣珍眉綠茶、協和同孚等行買進、做開六十四五元、較前提漲三四元、屯溪源等路珍眉、連日到貨不多、市上存底絕薄、致無大宗交易、惟針眉秀眉珠茶等貨、法莊銷路活動、低莊貢熙、白頭莊亦多需要、</p>
<h3>糖市　國產棉赤號盤轉挺</h3>
<p>昨日糖市以關金轉降、趨勢疲弱愈甚、公會劃盤二四粗砂白現貨呌十六元、轉口貨約四元八角、均未成交、太古糖及本廠綿白等呌價如前、亦乏進出、惟國產正綿赤自漲價以來、走銷見活、前昨兩日、由潮帮號家共開出六百包之譜、身色俱佳者開十一元六角、以次自十一元二三角至十一元、市勢轉挺、價亦略漲、</p>
<h3>南北貨　為統一市價起見　北貨業組織金菜公司</h3>
<p>金針菜登新以來、如徐州清江衆興等貨、次第已到、閩廣等帮均有採購、昨據鎮江長途電話、首批新仰花菜亦已到鎭、申市行方正在接治採購、即可運申云、</p>
<p>又訊、申市北貨同業、鑒於以往競爭、結果極難獲利、故對於本届新金菜上市、特集資組織一公餘有限公司、統一市價、以收合作之效、昨已成立、於進出方面、均能一致、試辦一個月、如有成續、則再謀機續、惟限於金菜一項、他貨不與云、</p>
<h3>五金　點錫僵局仍難打開</h3>
<p>點錫市面、近因環境不佳、各帮觀望不辦、到貨則頻頻裝來、販買之客戶及紹興之錫波莊、均受銀根緊迫、及農村崩潰影響、均停止採辦、是以成交之鮮少、標準鬆、如正號荷蘭鍚每担估一百六十元、副號一百五十元、瓜硔錫開一百四十八元五角、番條錫估一百四十元、福足錫開一百五十九元、斗錫估一百四十八元、均比前市回落一、二元不等、無如近來同業急謀出手、但買戶靜而不動、因此趨勢異常沈寂、茍非大批交易、行情尙有續疲之日也、</p>
<h3>狹條馬口鐵街銷獨盛</h3>
<p>狹條馬口鐵、新近客帮買賣平靜、惟本街生意異常興奮、蓋廠家方面因行情高貴、故多下宇採辦狹條鐵以代之、因狹條鐵價廉而物美也、查昨市成交二百餘箱、其價每箱美貨售二十元零五角、英貨售十九元七角半、法貨開十八元五角、聞由北蘇州路一帶五金號售出、</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （徐小庭）</p>
<p>纖微的細雨，不一定向屋子裏鑽進，組織紛雜的社會，不一定使靑年子弟墮落。屋子免鑽雨，須要補漏縫，靑年子弟免墮落，須要灌以相當之知識。</p>
<p>反對貞操是浪漫婦女，反對讀書是墮落靑年。其實在貞操圈子裏求生活的婦女，有時會不貞操。在讀書的環境裏求學問的靑年，有時會不去求學。事在人爲，時勢造英雄，環境有時會改移本性。</p>
<p>救濟農村雖然要經濟補助。但種子改良，肥料研究，在在須要注意。從一方面着想是死的，從多方面着想是活的。</p>
<h3>女子與美</h3>
<p>— 張凰</p>
<p>只要是一個女子，在靑春時代總有幾年是很美麗的，不過伊們大都不能自知罷了。</p>
<p>女子之中，若有臉龐果眞長得非常美麗，或者非常話潑的，或者體態果眞長得非常瀟灑的，這在伊們是决不會不自知曉的了！</p>
<p>伊們發現同性問的美麗者，能比男子們更優爲而且更迅速些。伊們並能傾羨同性的美麗出於十分眞誠，全不攙含入一絲妬意若無特別緣故。</p>
<p>伊們自然最喜自己得有美麗，並出全力使達「有美皆備，無麗不臻」的程度；所謂「女兒愛好自天然，」不必有何作用，如「女爲悅己者容」這等心理存在。所以伊們常怕靑春易逝，每個女子大概不惜那化妝品的消耗量與歲俱增的，雖然伊正在靑春年少，容光煥發的時期，若使有人戲弄伊，說：「什麼幾天不見，你似乎消瘦了好些！放寬點懷抱罷，不値得自己弄得這般氣色　一伊必會相信這人的言語，對伊自己懷凝起來的。又若有人恭維一個三四十歲的老女道：「什麼你長是這麼年靑的！要是你再略爲留意一點裝飾，你不還是在十七妙年華時代麽？」我知伊雖在平日常常歎惜痛恨於伊的姿容漸趨衰老，伊要感謝這人替伊訂正那歷來神經過敏的謬念，使伊瞿然醒將過來了，你可知道伊這時內心裏橫添着何等莫名的快威，同時讚佩這人是唯一的識者，儘伊在表面上是照例的的謙遜不遑：「喔唷，我們是老太婆了」阿！</p>
<p>實在，女子們與美的關係確是勝於男子們多多的。但瞧罷，在電話裏或無線電播音裏傳來的女子口音，多數是嬌脆的；在街路上行走的女子體態，多數是嬝娜的，要是你不在劈面碰見，也不想追過頭去瞧一個究竟，這一點特別的天賦，原是女子們的生命綫啊！</p>
<p>我在這裏同情於女子的特美，願天下女孩兒都成安琪兒，亞們！</p>
<h3>當心</h3>
<p>— 涓隱</p>
<h3>特徵</h3>
<p>— （花鈴）</p>
<p>有一外人，漫遊亞洲，把他的行程，結束在加拿大。他對於每一個所在，都有一些兒奇妙的發現。</p>
<p>不錯，他的奇妙的發現，有些是道人之所未道，而且是往往被別個旅行者所忽略的。</p>
<p>這自然是挺有趣的，因此，我現在摘錄幾條在下面：</p>
<p>檳榔嶼—說的都是英國人，但是你向任何一憫「英國人」詢問，結果，總是蘇格蘭人。</p>
<p>科侖布—充滿着狡猾不過的商人。</p>
<p>澳大裏亞—有的是熱的肉饅頭和熱咖啡。爪哇—那是一個都市沒人愛，而郊外却有人滿之患的所在。</p>
<p>英屬馬來—街道是淸潔，平坦，顯着是嚴格管理着的，空氣是顯着嚴肅。</p>
<p>暹羅—那是個用鬥魚作勝負的所在。</p>
<p>緬甸—宗敎的色彩，是比了東方的任何一國爲濃厚。</p>
<p>中國—人們是沒有一定的進食時間和進食的次數的。可以閒談着挨過整天的。</p>
<p>上海—那是一個華麗的都市，夜生活是、永遠沒有完結的。</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十五回　苦口婆心不平空拍案錢聲燈影可憐正賣人</p>
<p>志前心想，土海旅館裏，類乎這樣的事，也不知道有多少，何必對這件事放心不下。於是在網籃裏抽出一本書來，放在燈下看。剛看了兩行，自言自語的說了一句不行，便高聲叫着茶房。茶房提了開水壺進來，問是要開水嗎？志前道：我不要開水，我問你一句話。那張先生屋裏，剛圍了許多人，又弄着洋錢響，他們鬧些什麽。茶房微笑着，沒有答復。志前道：好像那朱姑娘已經賣給那姓賈的了吧？房茶笑道：也不算賣！就算給一把五十塊錢禮金，把人收過去。若是賣，賈先生還可以多出幾個錢的。因爲朱家人只不肯斷了來往，賈先生說，以後的拖累，一定很多，所以就不加錢了。不過他也總要　一頭，因此說好了，今日晚上，一面交錢，一面就要交人。賈先生有的是錢，只當把這一多塊錢嫖掉了，也不把來當回什麽事，志前道：今晚上就把人送了過去，爲什麽這樣快？茶房道：人家已交出錢來了，人不送去，他怎麽肯答應？他那樣痛快，交錢出來，不就爲的是……茶房說着話見志前的顏色不好看，自走了。志前呢，明覺得這件事與自己無千，可是心裏頭總覺得喝醉了酒一樣，非常的不自在，書是不能看了，睡又睡不着，只是在燈下悶坐着。約有一小時之久，遠遠的聽到這小西天的後門，有人敲着嚮。隨着這院子裏的茶房，就向後門走着去了。（二五八）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>那四位御醫老爺給太后所開的藥方上一般都有十二樣藥味開着，其中大約有一半是互相雷同的，有一半是谷別的；總計起來，也有二十多樣。太后却把他們的藥方逐一看下去，一路看，一路便把各種藥的性　問那老太：——也有幾樣是伊自己向來知道的，那就不用再問：還有幾　是伊雖然知道，却不十分肯定，或者已忘掉了，便都得問那老太監。—這樣且看且問，儘　合伊自己意思的記下，待到揀滿了十二樣，伊就不再揀下去了於是那司書的太監便另外用一張白紙，恭恭敬敬的把伊老人家所揀出來的十二味藥物　正了。這樣就造成了第五張的藥方。這一張第五張的藥方是兼採原來那四張藥方之長（？）而集合成的，原來那四張藥方上的藥物，都有一二或三四味被採用在內，所以也可以說是一張混合體的藥方；但這些原來不在同一張藥方上的藥物，如此胡亂混合起來，性質是否相宜，有無衝突，太后却絕不注意，也不再讓那四位御醫取去研究研究。然而這一張混合藥方要是　出了什麽亂子來，那四位御醫却又逃不了責任。無怪我那時在旁邊瞧着，幾乎詫異得失聲叫喊了。</p>
<p>「現在藥方己寫就了。」太后又瞧着我說道：「德齡，還是若你去走一次吧！當那四個呆笨的醫官在給我準備藥的時候，你必須很小心地監視着他們」！（三五八）</p>
<h3>報販阿五</h3>
<p>— 白丁</p>
<p>每天，當太陽剛爬上了東山，還沒有多少時候，那個依着販報生活的阿五，便很急促地在祇有三塊板搭成的牀上起來了，披一件七穿八洞的破衫兒，也不洗臉，便這樣地怱忽跨開疲意的脚步，向販報的總匯集處——望平街進發了。每天，刻板起實行着，無論天氣怎樣壞，下雨，下雪，發大風，不必說，照例地要冒着風雨出去的。他明白，這是爲了生活，爲了吃飯，不這樣便沒有飯吃，沒有了生命。</p>
<p>終年的辛勞，把阿五磨折成一個癆病鬼的模樣：兩顆眼珠深深地陷在眶子裏，面孔是蒼自得沒有一綃血色，面頰骨高高地聳起，乾癟的嘴唇，瘦削的下巴，驟然碰到會看成了一個猴子一般。</p>
<p>於是，同伴們替他起了一個綽號：「猴子阿五。」</p>
<p>鐘聲才響了六下，十分之九九的人們還都甜蜜地睡在夢鄉裏。然而阿五却已像走馬燈一樣的把剛從望平街批來的報向各家各戶在分發了。</p>
<p>阿五是一個辛勤的人，他除了早上替人家發報外，在晚上沒有事，他還得販了些夜報來，在街頭巷尾，像飛也似的喊賣，當然，那也是風雨無阻的。</p>
<p>據他對我說，他這樣的儉勤，家裏還不能一飽，因爲除了他自己之外，他還有一個六十餘歲的父親，和一個妻子，兩個孩子呢？</p>
<p>可憐，他在前幾天爲了受着風雨的打擊遍身發熱了。實在不能支撑着來送報，所以，這幾天送報的是他一個旣小且弱的十五齢的孩子呵！</p>

<h3>楊梅雜談</h3>
<p>— 紅羊</p>
<p>楊梅也是仲夏的一種佳菓，色紫味梅也是仲夏的一甘，形如刺栗而小，無皮有核，在端陽節後，便上市了。最好的楊梅，大如胡桃，色比紫綬，汁多核心，入口甘潔，沒有酸澀的弊病，在水菓中，可稱是可口的一種。</p>
<p>楊梅的產地甚多，蘇州太湖洞庭山所產生的，與自沙枇杷齊名，其餘浙江蘭谿等地，也有很多的出產，品質也不亞於洞庭所產，還有一種白楊梅，較紫色的略小而扁，核小如黃豆，甜味如蜜，比了紫色的，還得勝過幾分，只是出產不多，除了當地的人，可以嘗到之外，別地絕少得見，不能有這種口福。</p>
<p>平常食楊梅之法，多先將楊梅用冷開水或沙濾水洗凈，略放鹽花，使融化在楊梅的上面，如此可以殺除楊梅上寄生的虫類，這也因了楊梅無皮，虫類容易寄生在菜上，食鹽有消毒殺虫的功效，所以有這種食法。現在市上所售的楊梅之外，還有用冰鎭冷的一種，食時越發覺得齒類流芳，凉爽可口了。但是這冰鎭楊梅的食法，並不是從今日方始，在以前早已有了，吳寬楊梅詩中，有欲知其冷好，千顆薦冰盤盤的詩句，便是有冰鎭楊梅的鐵證。</p>
<p>關於楊梅的佳話很多，三國時，「楊脩年九歲，孔融指其父所設之楊梅，示脩曰，此君家果也，　應應聲曰；未聞孔雀是夫子家禽。」梁時，「任防爲新安太守，郡有蜜嶺產楊梅，舊爲太守所採，昉以採時甚險，且多毒物，即時停之。」齊時，「王虛之庭中楊梅，隆冬三實，人謂孝盛所致。」這都是一時的佳話。</p>
<p>楊梅的別名亦多，有驪珠，一陸游詩，未愛滿般　惟火齊，先驚探頷得驪珠。」鶴頂，「徐階詩，折來鶴頂紅涇，剜得龍睛血未乾。」聖僧，「潛確類書載，揚州人稱白楊梅爲聖僧。」紅實，「郭正祥楊梅詩，紅實綴靑枝，爛　照前塢。」金丹，「兵珂詩，雲池看大樹，霞室試金丹。」　彈，「徐階詩，三春葉底靑丸小，五月枝頭　彈圓。」隋珠，「李東陽詩，名從傳　遙分派，價比隋珠亦稱情。」這都是楊梅著名的別稱。</p>
<p>據「西湖亭實」載，杭州楊梅塢，在南山近瑞峯石塢內，有一老嫗姓金，其家楊梅甚盛，俗稱楊梅塢，所謂金婆楊梅是也。可見杭州亦有楊梅的產生，而且以人得名，自然是楊梅的佳種，但是在現在，並沒有再聽得有金婆楊梅的名稱，連杭州楊梅塢的地名，也並不存在，這可眞是楊梅產生區域的滄桑。</p>
<p>「貴耳集」職，閩士赴科，吳士赴調，各以鄉產自誇，閩曰茘枝，吳曰楊梅，有題於壁上者曰，閩鄉玉女含冰雪，吳郡星郞駕大雲。從這記載看來。吳郡的楊梅，可以與茘枝並稱，且早已名聞全國，並不是從今日始了。</p>

<h3>量子論指示下的無線電波</h3>
<p>— 浩</p>
<p>在量子論未曾發明時，解釋電磁波最有力的學說，當推波動說了，自從愛因斯坦發明了相對論後，量子論便根據他奠定了一個穩固的基礎，並且推翻了波動說的一部份，那末量子論對於電磁波怎樣解釋的呢？</p>
<p>他說：「我們知道世界上一切物質都是由原子所構成，而原子則又爲一個原子核（Nucleus）和圍繞在他周圍的幾個電子（Electrons）所組成。電子繞原子核而轉動，速度爲每秒二千二百公里，速度旣這樣大，那末他的離心力必定也很大，但是爲什麼不飛出去呢？就因爲有原子核中遊離的陽電子（Protons）和遊離電子間的吸力的緣故，其吸力的大小和距離有關，故倘電子從外層的軌道移至內層軌道時，或從內層軌道移至外層軌道時，必有相當能力放出或吸入，電子旣是世界上一切物質的最小單位，那末此種吸入或放出的能力，當然是能的最小單位，叫做能量子，（Ouantum）這種放射出來的能量子，便以每秒三十萬公里的速度向四方射出，每秒中放射出的能量子的組數就是此種電磁放射的週率，兩組相鄰的能量子問的距離，就是此種電磁放射的波長，倘這週率在六萬到一千五百基羅週中時，便是短波無綫電波，在一千五百到六百基羅週時，便是廣播無綫電波」。</p>
<p>以上不過是一個簡略的說明罷了，諸位假使要詳細研究，那末請參考專門討論量子論的書籍，這裏因篇幅關係，只得從略了。</p>
<h3>壓電式聽筒</h3>
<p>— 泡</p>
<p>有壓電作用（Piezo-electric　cffect）之物質，當受到壓力或張力時，其表面上即發生一種電壓；反之若加以電壓，則其體態上卽發生變更。利用此種特點，若以已受音樂調幅之電壓施諸一塊有壓電作用之物質上時，卽產生一種相應的體態變更、此種體態變更，若能設法用一種機械結構以激動空氣，則可得原來之音樂聲矣。壓電式聽筒（Piezo-electric　head-phone），卽根據此原理造成，其結構與普通磁石式聽筒完全不同。</p>
<p>壓電式聽筒乃美國The　Brush　Development　Co.出品，外形如甲圖，其中所用具有壓電作用之物質，爲羅氏鹽晶體（Rochelle　Salt　Crystal,）卽酒石酸鈉鉀）計八分之五英寸見方，〇·〇一英寸厚。聽筒全體重量僅六盎司。</p>
<p>此式聽筒之靈敏度異常高超，迴阻在一千週率時爲五萬歐姆；其工作週率之範圍，則可自六十週至一萬週。當接入收音機使用時，接法與普通聽筒相異，詳細如乙圖，圖中之阻流圈或耗阻器，乃用以做末級眞空管之屏極負載者。</p>
<h3>德國的電視</h3>
<p>— 彥</p>
<p>美國的電視還未實現，而英德因政府的帮助，電視已開始廣播了，歐洲的其他國家都羣起摹仿，並且可以說歐洲人是犯了激烈的電視狂。</p>
<p>在柏林有兩個十吋直徑的銅環，已出現在四百五十呎高的天空中，此後電視不是什麽專門的名詞，而變成通俗化了，這兩個銅環就是「柏林電視廣播電台」的天綫，從這奇特的天綫上播出十五廷電力的超短波，差不多能播及週圍五十哩。每一個電視廣播電台有二座廣播機，一座就是普通的發音機，還有一座就是播影機。無綫電接收者或電視的觀衆，也用一座特別的接收機去接收，這種接收機的影慕有四時高六時闊與十吋高十二吋闊二種。</p>
<p>對於電視節日的調整是很客易的，因爲兩電視電台的波長有七公尺的空間，這就是說在這波段裏電台很少。接收機的選擇性是不生問題的，兩個電視電台同時播送也沒有防礙。</p>
<p>「柏林電視廣播電台」已經用七公尺的波長廣播電九個月了，顯出來的影是黑自二色，但平常總是帶點籃色或錄色。如果電視電台都像「柏林廣播電台」一樣用「一百八十綫形「（180　lines　manner）那麽不但頭部，就是全身的動作也可以表現出來。</p>
<p>收影機每具的價格是二百五十元到五百元美金。電視接收機可分爲二部，一部是收音，一部是收影及顯影。陰極綫是收影機的主幹。</p>
<p>最近德國造了一輛電視車，車頂上有一架標準活動攝影機，能四週隨意轉動。那中空的攝影機的支　物是用來輸送已攝好的底片到暗室裏去—卽汽車的車身。利用特別的器具與很快的化學作用，把這底片顯出。那未乾的底片經過了abtastgerat而分成一百八十條綫，並且每綫都有强弱電流之分別。傳影機把這照片播到空中去，無綫電觀衆就能接收了。</p>
<h3>最新式複作用眞空管1C6之特性</h3>
<p>— KMK</p>
<p>自複作用眞空管問世以來，業餘家莫不羣起試騐，互相研究，該眞空管非僅工作上給予吾人莫大之便利，而佔地又小，便利已極。</p>
<p>1A6眞空管爲直流複作用眞空管之一種，其管內共包含五個柵，其詳細特性在本刋已屢有介紹。其標準用途，係專用於直流超外差式收音機。如第一級檢波及局外振　等工作，但爲省電計，故在設計上各極電流皆求低小。用於超外差式收音機中，祗要將各附件配得準確，工作上當然不生問題，然使用該眞空管於普通回授式收音機，却不能得到美滿的成績。因此各國製造廠爲改良求精又有1C6眞空管之相繼問世，其內部各極之構造，與1A6管無　，不同者，不過各極電流稍强耳。</p>
<p>1C6眞空管之絲壓為二弗打，絲流爲一百二十千安培，（較1A6加强一倍），屏極最大耐壓爲一百八十弗打，屏流一·五千分安培，簾柵極電壓爲六十七。五弗打，電流爲二千分安培，第一個柵極爲發振電路之輸入極，第二柵極爲發振電路陽柵極，係代替發振電路之屏極用，電流爲〇·一一千分妥培，第三與第五兩柵極卽　柵極，第四柵極爲高週率電浪輸入極，至於各極徘例燈脚與1A6相同，該眞空管非惟用於超外差式收音機，成効驚人，就是使用於別項工作，亦能得到相當之効果也</p>
<h3>業餘隨筆</h3>
<p>— 劉同康</p>
<p>音量控制器在收音機中，應用作「過荷」的調劑，不用說，這是任何人都知道。</p>
<p>普通調節管理再生的電容器或燈絲變量電阻雖也能使音量增減，但這不能認爲是良好的方法，而且這也是要使收音機的靈敏度，眞空管效力减弱，絲極受損。</p>
<p>在低週率放大級裝置音量控制器以限制電壓的輸入，是比較妥穩安全，然而困難問題又相繼發生，當此法使用於設有多級高週率放大的收音機時，檢波級將因負荷過度而產生失眞現象。</p>
<p>調節高放管簾柵壓電，以控制音量，似乎較爲有效，然而也不是十全的方法。</p>
<p>在目下，應用最廣，收效最宏的音量控制法，莫如在應用可變係數放大高放管時，調節其丙負電壓以控制其放大係數，而同時再增减天綫輸入電能。</p>
<p>然而在直流收音機內畢竟，因眞空管構造工的關係，應用此法的不多，其實這也並無絲毫的困難，這里介紹的卽是一例牠的裝置綫路見圖一。</p>
<p>V是高放管，C是OOIMFD固定電容器，R是5000歐姆固定電阻，RFC是85MH長波式高阻圈，C、是丙電（它的電壓須視眞空管而定，如43號，則須用二十二個半弗打）Ri卽是音量控制器，阻力約爲50000歐姆-100000，歐姆</p>
<h3>初裝收音機之步驟（二）（續）</h3>
<p>— 學綸</p>
<p>（三）電源變壓器</p>
<p>電源變壓器一名為代甲丁電器，其作用係將交流市電降壓為甲電，以供眞空管之絲樞，及另一昇壓或降壓之綫團，將其電流整流為乙電，以供各眞空管之屏樞，所以電源變壓器為一收算機之供電樞紐，設計必須準備，構造必須堅固，使收音機工作合法，而經久耐用也構造內容，則匪特工料窳劣，且電壓電流，亦不合我輩自裝收音機之用，必不可購。</p>
<p>關於電源變壓器之詳細設計法，本刋與各雜誌中，俱有記載，茲不　述。本機所需之電力，約爲六十V，A，可按照下表自繞，倘初進同志，覺自製不易，則以委託國貸廠家代製較妥。</p>
<p>亞美或中雍二號　鋼片　至四十公厘厚，約重二磅。</p>
<p>二二號鐵夾一付</p>
<p>初級二二〇弗打，用美制二六號漆綫繞九三八圈。</p>
<p>次級高壓六導〇弗打，用美制三二號漆綫二四五六圈，抽中心分綫。</p>
<p>絲樞六·三弗打，用美制一八號漆綫二六圈，抽中心分綫。</p>
<p>整流絲樞五弗打，用美制一六號漆綫二一圈，抽中心分綫。</p>
<p>自繞時先取硬紙板製一線軸，內面積爲三二公厘×四〇公厘，熔蠟浸透，繞絕緣布一二層後繞　級綫　，其外再裏絕緣布一二層，絕緣布之外，裏香烟錫紙一層，兩端不可接觸，一端接一導綫，聯鐵心通地，此種裝法，可以免除交流聲不少，次級高壓綫圈繞於初級之外，仍用絕緣布隔離，最外層繞低壓綫圈兩枚，用蠟紙絕緣，全部綫圈繞畢後，將　鋼片一一插入，鐵夾夾緊，電源變壓器已製成矣。（待續）</p>

<h3>民族運動與文化運動</h3>
<p>— 葉靑</p>
<p>從事民挨運動的人，往往鄙視文化運動。以爲那是把人拉進圖書室的辦法。對於反對帝國主義，不惟沒有關係，而且轉移民衆視綫，分散民衆力量。因而對於文化運動不僅鄙視，甚至加以咒詛。</p>
<p>它方面，從事文化運動的人，亦不理解民族運動的意義，往往認然那是徒呌口號的辦法。他們主張敎育救國，科學救國。在「九一八」時代，他們把烟拿戰役中的黑格爾舉出來，呌人學他，安心讀書著書。</p>
<p>這都是各有所偏，各有所蔽的。其實，民族運動與文化運動二者應當統一。爲甚麼呢？因爲實踐不能離開理論，理論不能離開實踐。要</p>
<p>互相結合。　　　成一個完整的生活歷程。</p>
<p>那末，民族運動便有籍於文化運動了。</p>
<p>第一，所謂民族運動，應該是被壓迫民族大多數人的運動。這就必要有一個理論來喚起大家，統一意志和整齊步武。然而被壓迫民族常常是落後民族，其大多數人智識水準很低。所以散播理論這件事，非形成一個運動不可。並且於中還有提高智識水準的必要。這當然須借助於文化運動。</p>
<p>第二，帝國主義之侵略被壓迫民族，有一種理論作口實。甚麼人種優劣呀，甚麼開化落後民族呀，非常好聽。而且它還要用基督敎來麻醉民衆，辦學校來製造洋奴。被壓迫民族在這時，必須要有一個理論與它對抗。不揭破它的面具，連自己的團結都感困難，因爲他的意識被帝國主義征服了。</p>
<p>到這裏，不顯然見得被壓迫民挨應該有他自己的文化運動麼？這是他的民族運動的起點和工具。民族運動有賴於文化運動。義和團時代已經過去了，原始暴動的方式和簡單的排外方式都用不着。</p>
<p>它方面，文化運動也有資於民族運動。</p>
<p>文化是人類適應環境以謀生活的工具。被壓迫民族在受帝國主義侵略時，生存發生問題，應該要把文化運動與民族運動聯繁起來。這就是說，文化運動當成爲反帝國主義運動之一種。</p>
<p>這樣，文化運動的路綫就必須是民挨運動。換言之，它是被壓迫民族之精神的獨立自由的宣言。因此它應該以反對帝國主義文化爲口號。一般人口中的西洋文化或歐洲文化，就是帝國主義文化。胡適的歡迎西洋文化和陳序經的全盤西化，只是呌我們自動爲帝國主義之精神奴隸的花言巧語。以民族運動爲路綫的文化運動，必在反對帝國主義意識中反對它在被壓迫民族文化中的洋奴買辦。</p>
<p>民族運動和文化運動經過了交互滲透的結合，雙方都有補益。在民族運動方面，有覺悟的民衆，有嚮導的理論，它便近代化了，容易收功。而在文化運動方面，則有獨立的意識，有創造的精神，可以在發現發明的領域與先進國並駕齊驅。</p>
<p>在這裏，假如那自甘作歐洲帝國主義在中國　推銷它的文化的洋奴買辦非笑我的發現發明時，我將答道：你上帝國主義文化的當了！依它，白種人爲天之驕子，有色人是生就的劣種，你現在確實以劣種自居，連發現發明的志氣都不敢有。你太配當亡國奴了。我們呢？我們要當人，我們要完盡我們對於文化的責任，我們要創造文化。</p>
<p>落後民族能創造文化麽？能。我在本刊前期已證明落後民族只要從世界文化發展之尖端出發就能創迭文化。對於歐洲的哲學，科學，文學呢？批判地吸納，排除其糟　而吸收其精華。哲學，我們要新物質論而棄此外的一切；科學，我們要自然科學，對社會科學則多取事實少取理論；文學，我們要技術和意識之優良者。至於孕育有未來文化的新芽，我們則以之作創造的模式，發揚而光大之。總括一句，使被壓迫民族脫離精神上的殖民地之痛苦，得着他在文化方面應有的自由發育，而從此成爲世界文化前進中的推動者之一員。這不是我們——被壓迫民族中人——從事文化運動者的責任麽？</p>
<p>凡不敢說創造文化的人，請他退出文化界去。讓我們來高張反帝國主義文化的旂幟，宣布中國民族精神上的獨立自由！</p>
<h3>北平圖書館的幾種索引</h3>
<p>— 史略</p>
<p>（一）國學論文索引</p>
<p>（二）文學論文索引</p>
<p>（三）中國地學論文索引</p>
<p>現在中國索引的編纂方式，是五花八門，還無一精確詳密的格式產生。所以我們引用某種索引，開始總要瞭然這種索引編輯排檢的方式及其特長，方始濟事。北平圖書館所纂的索引。按以上幾種，牠是有一個共同性。大概牠們的材料都取自雜誌；牠們的性質都算作一個專的學門；牠們的編排都是以篇目內容來分類。所以我們可把這種索引名之爲「專門的雜誌論文篇目分類索引」。</p>
<p>這種索引惟一的特長，便是給與該學門的研討者，以參考雜誌論文極大的便利。比如我們想研究該學門中的某一問題而無從着手，那麽即可翻檢該索引中的某一部類；再從部類中的每條「按圖索驥」，觸類旁通，則該問題不難迎刃而解。因爲這種研究法；在深邃方面，可以知其問題眞實的歷史演變的程序；在廣博方面，可以探知各家系派之主旨論言——由於編輯者預先費了苦心，把內容相同的論文歸納到一堆，研討者非但省了亂事翻檢的功夫，從而更免掉盲目搜求的苦力了！</p>
<p>惟是「分類法」，在現今中國的圖學中，尙無一標定法則尤其是在論文上，恐怕千古以後，也難成立一種不可推移的守則。所以一般的圖學家把「分類」名之爲「藝衛」的，而非「科學」的。因此，分類的索引，差不多的很難作到人人以爲盡善盡美，一無可疵之處；况且在論文方面，有很多的含了多種問題，有很多的難於歸納到某一種部類去——這樣，編之者困難，檢之者也就不易了。是故，我們要引用這種索引的時候，首要的，就得知道淸楚了牠劃分的類目。以下，略將三書分別述之。</p>
<p>國學論文索引，已出三編，初編於民國十八年七月出版。編著者爲王重民先生，先生邃於國故，精通目錄之學。其後記自稱此書編輯開始於民國十四年夏。計收雜誌八十二種，得論文三千數百十篇。自民國十七年七月以上，二三十年來國學之著述，概己搜羅輯入。其分類　網目，計為：一總論；二羣經；三語言文字學；四考古學；五史學；六地學；七諸子學；八文學；九科學；十政治法　學；十一經濟學（附貨幣實業商業等）；十一一社會學；十三敎育學；十四宗敎學；十五音樂；十六藝術；十七圓　目錄學——蓋此目融合中西，變通四庫舊章而標以適應時代之名目者。此後，續編，二編一本此格，每於子目略有更動。計續編爲徐緒昌先生輯。民國二十年七月出版。收雜　　章八十餘種。論文量數，略與前編等。三編爲劉修業女士輯。民國二十三年十月出版。收雜誌報章一百九十二種，論文數量較前約增一倍。卷末添增一「所收刋物創刊年月表」，似爲蛇足。</p>
<p>文學論文索引，已出有續編。初編爲民國二十一年一月出版。據王重民先生序稱，本書與國率論文索引同時纂起。初爲張新虞先生編，繼由北平圖書館索引組陳璧如女士幷李芝軒女士續輯成之。計收雜誌　章共一百六十二種。由光緒三十一年起，至民國十八年十二月止。書分上中下三編。上編爲文學總論。其分類總綱目爲。。一通論；二文學義意和起源；三文學性質；四文學分類；，五文藝思潮；六文學創作；七文學批評；八文學家，九文學研究法；十文學與其他；十一各國文學。中編爲文學分論，其綱目爲：一詩與歌謠；二辭賦；三詞；四戲曲；五小說；六神話故事；七兒童文學；八其他。下編爲文學家評傳，其綱目爲：中中國文學家評傳；二日本文學家評傳；三印度文學家評傳；四俄國文學家評傳；五英國文學家評傳；六法國文學家評傳；七德國文學家評傳；八意大利文學家評傳；九美國文學家評傳；十西班牙文學家評傳；十一波蘭文學家評傳；十二荷蘭文學家評傳；十三挪威文學家評傳；十四丹麥文學家評傳；十五其他各國文學家評傳及合傳。外有附錄五：一文學敎學法；二文學，目；三文學書籍介紹；四文果家介紹；五文壇消息。續編爲劉修業女士編輯。計收雜誌　章一百九十三種。二十二年十一月出版。內容所收材料，續前編時間至民國二十二年五月止，其分卷分類大致同前；子目亦略事變動。惟此書額外收入文藝論著十種，計爲；中國文　論戰集，李何林編；中國現代女作家，賀玉波編著；中國文學史綱要，賀凱編著。文藝論集，郭沫若著；文藝自由論辯集，蘇汶主編；世界文學家列傳，孫　工編；現代中國文學家，錢杏邨編；現代中國女作家，黃英編；現代中國女作家，草野編著；現代的評傳，現代書局編——按此事，乃爲突破前例。所收十種書，有論文總集，有雜傳，且有文學史，性質及不相同；各該書又非出類拔萃之名著。且若李編中國文藝論戰集，郭著文藝論集內諸論文，率爲前編已收入者——這樣，非但乖異前體，選書未精，且有前後重覆之嫌；想來編者於此諸端，沒有什麽思索吧？</p>
<p>中國地學論文索引。民國二十三年四月出版。書凡兩册。爲王庸先生，茅乃文先生合編。計所收雜誌自光緒二十八年起至民國十六年穴月止。內容論文，性質不純限於地理學。凡所述自然狀態及人文事實之有地域性者，均經收入。其主要類目，計爲；一地誌及游記；——地文（附古物）！三民族；四政治；五交通；六經濟；七歷史；八地理圖書。（附中國地學與地學家）。卷末附有地名著者兩索引，似此編製，較前二書於引用上，其便利當爲增强。</p>
<p>此外，聞該館尙有兩大巨著，淸代文集篇目分類索引，及石刻著錄索引，尙在印編中。大約不日即可出而問世。（五月二十四日）</p>
<h3>各書局印象記（續）</h3>
<p>— 李衡之</p>
<p>二十二　作者書社</p>
<p>在北平，有個「著者書店」，在上海有個作者書社。二者的性質是有些不同的。平津一帶有幾個「敎員作家」（因並非全是大學敎授，故未能稱爲敎授作家）或是爲了自己的書沒有地方印，或是爲了受書店剝創，或是以爲自己用作課本的一定銷路好，所以組織了一個著者書店，自己出錢印書，交給自己的書店發賣。作者書社也是根據「作者自己出書」的需要而產生的，其與著者書店不同的地方，是社的本身全係中間經售商性質，非若著者書店即是著者組織，略近出版合作社的情形。</p>
<p>在外國，出版者與發售者已頗多分工的組織，而在中國，作者書社還是創舉。據說，作者書社的主人就是以前商務印書館代售部的主任。商務利用其分館多，聲譽大，寄售書籍銷路自有把握，而且又因爲有許多書販，全靠商務書籍爲業之故，對於商務賬務自必不敢不理，故給商務代售書籍，不會有「收不回賬」之虞。現在世界書局之外，何以會有世界出版合作社與大華書局，也就是這個緣故。自從一二八以後，商務的代售部取銷，也許當事者鑒於，商務代售部營業的發達，因而自組作者書社。若然，則在營業方面實有考慮的必要。</p>
<p>第一，作者書社不能與商務代售部相比。商務代售者所恃的有衆多的分館，內地以商務書籍的生命綫的各書商不敢拖欠賬狄，所以對於（一）如何把書推銷到各地去，（二）如何把賬歡收回來，這二點毫無問題。而現在作者書社所恃的是什麽呢？</p>
<p>第二，作者書社如把代售書籍分寄於內地各經售者，必然的會發生折扣上與付欵上的困難，在著作者自己，以爲把自己的書對折交作者書社發售，已是廉到無可再廉，然復交於內地經售者，對折收欵算是最高價格，而且內地經售者即使把書售出，未必即將欵交來，而大部作者，却不會諒解這點的，這是一個嚴重的矛盾，而首當其衝的就是作者書社。</p>
<p>第三，中國一般文化水準未發達到較高程度，私人及「非出版界的」團體出版書籍數量不多，作者書社似很難即以之爲營業主源，如仍以經售「書業中人」的出版物爲主要營業商品，則以普通一般代售書店無異，——事實上，作者書社漸有走上此路的傾向。</p>
<p>第四，近來各書店代售營業日趨發達，因其出版物之宣傳廣吿，自易招致讀者，如生活，開明，等家，代售的範圍，似有凌駕作者書社之勢，這未始不是作者書社的一個很大打擊。</p>
<p>在這種情形下，作者書社的路　　難走得通，作者　　　成立已有二三年，其未能充分發展，想亦就是這種客觀原因所限制。</p>
<p>作者書社自身不是一個出版者？本無印象可言，不過其　業的方法是新颕的，有足引起五人注意。常聞有人提　上海各書店成立聯合販賣方法，　方法很可參酌作者書社的情形。</p>
<p>李衡之啟事——各書局大概均以六月底爲會計年度終了，本人擬調查一年來各書局營業情形，以爲出版界令後之參考。至懇各書局將一年來：（一）出書數量及種類，（二）營業數額，（三）所有因難，（四）今後計劃等各點，詳爲示知，待略加整理，即於本刋發表，事關出版事業之前途，想荷各書局鼎力玉成。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>實非所願與不得已</h3>
<p>— 宸</p>
<p>前日報載老北門警所近派巡邏警，在民國路新橋街一帶，搜捕沿途拉客賣淫之野雞，因爲某種關係，祇獲兩口。帶所訊辦云云。上海娼妓之多，不但獨霸東亞，而且可以稱雄世界。據燕京大學美敎授花克的統計，一百三十人中，即有妓女一人，確切與否，不得而知。不過去年九月公共租界工部局僅以三五日的工夫，就捉捕上二百三四十人，弄得來特院新舊女監，滿坑滿谷，臭不堪聞，這大槪是讀者還可記得的事情。由此我們不難推想，如果民國路新橋街一帶的妓女，完全拿來警所的拘留所，是立刻可以「滿坑滿谷，臭不可聞」的。</p>
<p>這種奇景雖未顯露，但是却吿訴我們這一都市病態現象的慘狀。卽從這兩個妓女的口供中，知道她們是上有父母下有子女，爲了要「養活全家」，便「不得已」與「實非所願」的出此下策。我想不用談甚麽人類不平，單以人道主義出發，也不能不說妓女的生活是十二萬分的悲慘苦痛。每日送舊迎新的皮肉生涯，這本身已經是等於生理上精神上與自我蹂躪了，何况其間還有　層黑暗的剝削的索取。眞的，除了世上眞有那種先天淫蕩的「潘金蓮種子」，誰也不願走入這火坑，然而爲了生活，就「不得已」。</p>
<p>這就同自殺的事態一樣，雖然人人皆知生命有無上的價値，可是到了「萬事皆空」或者「人窮志短」的時候，便「不得已」走到自我的大解脫；賈淫亦復如是。誰也曉得將肉體作商品是一最悲慘的事情，然而不走此「下策」，就只好餓死。</p>
<h3>歸來</h3>
<p>— 覺夫</p>
<p>是一個初夏的黃昏。血紅的驕陽，雖還依戀地斜掛在遠處的峯巓上，但初夏所特有的晚風，已將所有的一切熱氣帶走了。</p>
<p>吃了許多年糧的阿竊，懷着一顆愉快的心，拖着一條受了傷的腿，不曉得曾爬過多少個山，越過多少條水，時日縈迴在他腦子中的那一個山　，這時終被他瞥見了。</p>
<p>在那一個山　中，隱伏着一個住有五六家人家的小村落，村落中就有他阿福的一個家。留在他的家中的，有一個妻，一個兒子，一個六十多歲的娘。他曾在那里埋葬了他三十多年的歲月，那里的每一棵樹，每一塊石頭，每一條曲折難辨的小徑，他都全記得：就七八年前當他被拉去食糧時，家中留存有多少隻雞，多少隻山羊，……這些他現在還能很淸楚地背出來。——這個家，不，這個整個山　，他是熱愛極了！</p>
<p>他走了許多天路，這時軀體雖然疲倦得不堪了，但他仍很快樂，很興奮，他巴不得一下子就跳進那一個傍依在山坡上面的大叢林中去。他一邊　地走着，一邊就在私自這麽盤算着：娘這時大槪是在燒飯了？那一個恐還在山上砍柴吧？小福子說不定已長得像自己一樣高大了？爸恐已認不得兒子了？……失踪了這許多年的遊子，這是突然地回來，娘一看見，她一定會喜得發狂，不，會落淚；那一個一看見，也一定會哭，說不定還會駡；就整個村子，想也會因了他這突如其來的歸來，而引起一塲不小的騷動的。他得吿訴他們他所身歷過</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>的一切，他得將他今後的計劃，願望，……統統對他們伸述，直至敎他們「破涕而笑！」……</p>
<p>他這麼想着想着，久已和他握別了的笑影，這時不覺又重浮上他削瘦的面孔來。他快樂極了，他整個身心，都全溶化在快樂的長流中！</p>
<p>他張着二度失神的眼睛，儘在東面溜溜，西面溜溜，好像是在找尋一件什麽最心愛的東西似的。他將眼前所看見的一切，來和遺留在他腦子中的那一個影，細細地做一個對比；他總希望從這一對比中，能找到一件什麽來證實他的記憶的準確。但他到底是失敗了，橫在他眼前的景物，他看來好像有些陌生。他記得，往前從山脚通進去，是有一條尺把寬的山路，臥在山路左面的，是一片五六畝大的稻田；他還記得，不管是那一個黃昏，從山脚看上去，常可看見裊裊的炊烟，從濃綠的林叢頂梢上飄出來，可以看見成羣的山羊，環繞着牠的主人，在山坡上到處亂奔着着，有時還能聽見犬吠，牛叫，孩子的吵鬧聲，……，但是現在呢？山路已找不到了，稻田已在蔓草叢莽中隱沒了：炊烟沒有了，山羊看不見了，牛羊的叫聲，孩子的吵　　聲，……也一同銷沈得無彩無踪了！——整個山，，是全淪沒在寂寞的深淵中！</p>
<p>阿福有點驚奇。他懷疑他的眼睛，懷疑他的腿，是否已看錯了方面，走錯了路了？但當他重抬起頭來，細看遠近的山頭，附着在山頭上的石壁林木時，……又覺得，這些他都十分熟面，親切，和留在他腦子里的那一個影並沒有什麼異樣。這時他有點着慌了，他那一顆興奮的心，有點灰冷了。他狂急地移開脚步，披開榛莽，直向那藏着他的家的林叢中奔過去。但及至他一穿進去時，他所不敢想像的可怕的景物，果在他的跟前出現了：他的家沒有了，所有的屋子，有的已完全坍倒了，有的已被蔓草野藤緊封着了，有的已被野火穿通了頂，只剩四幅墻壁元立在那里了！在這里，沒有人聲，沒有犬吠，整個村子全充溢着一種凄冷可怖的氣雾。向晚歸來的山鳥，盡在樹巓高噪着，生長在墻壁的裂口中的狗尾草，盡在那兒默默地點着頭。懷着一顆愉快的心，不曉得走過多少山，越過多少水，跳奔回來的阿福，終於在一棵山茶樹的旁邊倒下來了！</p>
<h3>日子</h3>
<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>日子悠悠地過去，生命越來越短促了。眼看見日曆一張一張地撕過去，無情的歲月把生命撕磨得越來越微薄。在回憶中，童稚之年尙依稀地存在腦中，那只知玩要而不知一切的無知的境界，倐忽間便去得那麽悠遠。便是在少年時期，那一味沈浸在書中，而不知海闊天空包藏萬象的社會現象，想起來也還似乎在昨日。却不料人已跨越了許多時日，到現在不但社會和人生的滋味深深地嘗透，精神旣不像往日的天眞活潑，而身體也顯然受盡了消磨，不像少年時期的壯健了。</p>
<p>人有時眞是滑稽和可笑；在無聊時盼望着日子的早過，到日子已過去，而回憶春甜蜜的過往時，却又害怕來日的到臨。所謂時間，本是呆板板地有一定的界限的，却因人事的關係，而生出愛戀或惜惡的戚情來。說時問的價値是跟隨人事而變遷的，那是深悉此理的了。</p>
<p>日子對於別人的感覺怎樣，我不知道。在我，日子却是很可愛戀的。每每在百忙中，看見待理的事件還成疊地堆積的時候，我每每咀咒日子的快過，而心裏永遠掛記着那些待理的事件。雖然有時心情也會墮落在寂寞與無聊問，而盼望日子的早過，但當掙扎了軟疲的身體，勉力提起了精神，把時間消磨在各種心愛的事業上時，日子又覺得可愛，而希望牠能像螞蟻般的慢慢爬過了。</p>
<p>在現在，當少年時期已過去，而老年尙未來臨的時候，對於日子，我尤覺得特別寳貴。過去的已是過去了，而未來的還沒到來，對於現在，我應當怎樣利用着這精力充裕的年齡，去從事我所喜歡的事業，使日子不會浪費地消耗下去，那便是我所以寳貴我的日子的原由了。雖然對於諺語所謂：「少壯不努力，老大徒悲傷。」的話，我是不十分佩服的，但想着一個人如果不能把日子好好地利用去實行他的志願，或滿足他的向上的嗜好，我却覺得可憐和可慘了，</p>
<p>不幸的是人的日子每每不能受人的支配：天旣使人必須把他的精力的大部分耗費去獲取維持生活的糧食，而人事的錯綜複雜又常常把人拉出於好好利用日子的圈內而轉向到浪費的垃圾堆中去。人的生命是短促的，日子和人身的精力都是極有限制的，則我雖要寳貴日子，而日子却不肯受我所珍貴了。那文有什麽說的？</p>
<p>這些時來，對於日子更另有一番更深的感覺：眼看得鬍子是一天一天長起來和密集起來了，而所做的事業却還沒有一點可以見人的成績。另一方面，則人事的糾紛越來越複雜，幾乎使我迫進到不能自由運用我的時間的界限。這種打擊固然一方面可以更加刺激我向我的前路邁進，而另一方面精力的消耗也着實令人害怕。我設想假若有一天我的精力消耗至極度而令我軟癱無力了，則事業對於我只成一種夢想，那時的幻滅感一定很是深刻，而我更不能不咀咒起無</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>情的日子來了！</p>
<p>日子，消廳了人間的壯志雄圖，也成就了人間的勳功偉　，牠，對於我，又將把我造成什麽東西來呢？</p>
<h3>旱象</h3>
<p>— 桀人</p>
<p>書一陣急劇的鈴聲振盪着空間時，各個小房間裏藏着的人，都受了鞭策似的，一個個的走出來，一齊集中到市塲裏去。整個市塲頓時變得鬧　鬨，恣意的談笑聲，雜然的充塞在每一個角落裏。</p>
<p>隨着鈴聲嚮定，再過三五分鐘後，那只鐘噹噹噹噹的　了幾下，台後蓊着一色制服的所員，在鐘聲中一個一個的走上台，台上絡續轉出「開市」，「六月期」，「開盤」等幾個字，人聲似乎被稍壓下去。但是當站在台中央的拍板人的手指在空中開始做着手勢時，台下的人立刻又騷動起來。「二分半」，「二分七厘半」，「扯扯」，「扯扯」，你一聲，他一聲，直着喉嚨的喊。同時，幾十只手伸來伸去，空氣是十分緊張，每張面孔都呈着惶惶然若臨大敵的樣子。</p>
<p>拍板人眼睛凝視着台下，手指在空中不住做着各種手勢，一邊把板在檯上一拍，一邊嘴裏很快的念着：</p>
<p>十八號二十號二千，二十五號三十一號三千，…</p>
<p>那個坐在拍板人旁邊的記錄員，他的手如發條開足了，只管在揮動。那邊掛牌地方；黑底白字的牌子也一塊塊迅捷的掛出來。那些站在「非經紀人請勿入內」欄外的人，都引頸在望牌上的數字，各人面孔的表情，有欣然以喜，和嗒然若喪，彷彿整個生命是繫在那塊牌上一般。</p>
<p>一塊塊接運掛出來的牌子，它數字的比數，是一塊跟一塊的高上去，市塲裏的空氣顯得益發緊張了。</p>
<p>市面步步漲！</p>
<p>還要漲！洋麥也大一元多。</p>
<p>雨不落，旱要成，五六角行情不希奇！</p>
<p>是呀！看樣子，市面只會好，不會小。</p>
<p>差不多又要同去年一樣了！</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>市面上議論紛　，人人帶着一副驚愕的神色，對目前的形勢，發表各自的意見。</p>
<p>從「開盤」「二盤」」「三盤」至「收盤」，中間是稍稍停一會兒。又接下去是「七月期」以至「八月期」「九月期」「十月期」十一月期」，和「開盤」以至「二盤」三盤」「收盤」，台上的拍板人手在動，嘴在喊，台下的人也是手在動，嘴在喊，這樣的繼續着，一直到台上轉出「閉市」二個字，於是緊張的空氣才鬆弛下來，大家也慢慢的散開了。</p>
<p>守仁夾在人羣中，正走出塲口，後面忽有人向他就撞，回過頭一看，是二十一號的小李，小李是像只小麻雀，跳跳蹤蹤，沒有一刻安定，收市後不是拉誰談女人，便是找人打架。他向守仁扮扮鬼臉，笑嘻嘻的說：</p>
<p>爛大塊頭，挑你不死，要請客！</p>
<p>守仁雖然是個胖子，却最恨人叫他「大塊頭」，因爲這顯然太不恭敬了。可是今天小李叫他「大塊頭」他非但不氣，反而會心的向他笑了笑，管他走到自己的房間去。</p>
<p>一回到房間裏，守仁便倒在沙發中，昨夜馬將叉得太晏，剛才又在市塲裏嘶喊一陣，是使他很感到疲倦的。他閉起目，想養一會神，但是他的神經却不讓他安靜，想想今天的市面，「自開盤」後就逐步的漲上去，這樣子，不要又同去年一樣了嗎？驀地裏，回憶喚醒了他，去年也是這樣呀！不過去年是眼睜睜的讓它白過去，今年可不能輕放過，也得學一次乖呀！前天報上登着，有幾處地方已在鬧旱災，無論如何，照這樣子旱象是釀成，看看天，太陽血紅的，不要說雨，恐怕要比去年還要旱得利害吧！</p>
<p>忽然在膝上一拍，元的從沙發裏站起來，在室中踱着，一會又坐下。</p>
<p>刻刻可以不回出，這幾分行情也賺不好，朝後行情正要好哩！</p>
<p>他不免怨恨自己太沒果斷，明明行情還要看好，爲什麽要緊回出？雖然只回出少數，不過可以多賺，却變得少賺，心裏總有不甘，而懊惱着的。可是這懊惱畢竟也是暫時的，因爲他覺得還有更大的希望在前，立刻將這懊惱不知拋到那裏去了。</p>
<p>也罷，就少賺些，手裏還多着的，可非揑到有七八角行情不回出，這行情不希奇。旱吧！旱得越利害越好，這行情怕它不到嗎　？</p>
<p>他立起身，伸一伸懶腰，走到窗前望望天空，天空掙藍的一片，沒染半絲雲兒，太陽是血血紅，高掛在當中。</p>
<p>哈，旱象准成了！</p>
<p>這樣自語時，嘴角浮上一個微笑，一個滿意的微笑呀！</p>
<h3>鐵柵窗外</h3>
<p>— 里昂</p>
<p>兩三個月前吧，我經過這裏的時侯，正在翻造房屋，在暖和的流着桃花馨香的氣息裏，泥水匠，木匠，下手小工哼着由歌，手忙脚亂的工作着，每天上下午兩次，總痴呆呆的站着看，看他們打地椿。豎鋼條，澆氏敏士，砌石塊，鋪鋼板。起童機憤怒的噴吐黑媒烟，「轟隆隆，豁啦啦……」不斷地叫着，一個粗暴的醉漢似的，把幾丈長的木柱子恨命往地底打下，泥土經這番傾軋，開始伸張各個方面的勢力而震動附近一帶的房屋。</p>
<p>地工完畢，牆垣一天一天的加高，紅色的磗塊，灰色的傳塊，又闊又厚，年紀小的童工搬不上四五塊便哼　着移不開步子了。普通的居屋是不需要這樣堅實的磚塊的，廠屋吧？不見烟囪和風筒。堆棧吧？不配裏面有許多牆壁……我把這疑問保持着，等事實來解决。每天，依然有兩次，痴呆呆的站着，看許多泥水匠把牆垣向上建……高，高，高，像一堵城堡。</p>
<p>牆垣工稈成功，氣候已是初夏，熱烈的陽光射照着紅色灰色的牆磚和烏黑發亮的屋頂，裏面的裝置看不見了，我想不會考究，因爲從來沒有看見考究的材料運進去除掉自來永管，電綫，組糙的鐵條以外。牆垣上窗洞是有的，可開得那樣高，而且，又開始有鐵匠在每個窗洞口裝置鐵柵了。我始終疑惑裏面是怎樣的一個所在？曾經問過一個瘦猴子般的鐵匠，他却蹲得高高的，帶着討厭的神色俯首望我一眼，我很識相地走了，脊背似乎出冷漢。</p>
<p>接通了電流，鐵窗裏面，從黑暗中透出幾點發黃的柔弱的燈光，又那樣的稀少，像烏雲層層浮於天空的夜晚，偶爾從雲隙裏見到一二顆星粒般的。我這顆探求奇跡的心始終叫我留意這座堅牢的屋子的進展。可是，那排裝鐵柵的窗口又裝上鐵皮罩子了，留一個空口向天空，空口四沿又鑲上鋼刺，銳利得驚心，這是防範的設置呵！我從此認識了這座屋子的威嚴。</p>
<p>我的料想：鐵窗柵裏面一定黑暗得不成世界了，難道將來住這屋子的人不喜歡光明？人類是不習　生活在黑暗中的，那麽，故意把光明摒隔在外面，而不給予人們享受，總不能不算爲是一種　　吧？</p>
<p>不是嗎，無論那堵牆有多麼厚，終祗是一牆的阻隔罷了。每天的太陽光，每天的月亮光，每天的淸快的風和自然流蕩的氣息會降臨到鐵柵窗外。</p>
<p>鐵柵窗外更換着四季的氣候和景色。飄流着孩子的笑，婦女的笑，一切活躍的聲音，和悅的聲音。鐵柵窗裏的人雖有眼睛却看不見季節的臉，雖有耳朶却聽不見自然的歡聲。他們被限制在他們的世界裏過着同一本日歷上的光陰。今天我走過這裏，見紅牆脚下已生了幾顆靑草，沾着雨露，欣欣向榮，這在鐵柵窗一裏是不會有的吧！我瞪着憂愁的眼睛望着地上。、</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the case of Fujian Province's proposed issuance of public bonds for clearing old debts, the Legislative Yuan stated that after the entry of the Party Army into Fujian in the 16th year of the Republic [i.e., 1927], the province's debt titles were complicated and the amount of debt was very large. Even based on the figures listed by the provincial government, it already exceeded 7 million yuan. The current issuance of public bonds for 5 million yuan is still insufficient for repayment, and the market price of the old public bond treasury bills is very low. All old debts to be repaid must be registered first, and the principal and interest of the debts must be determined one by one. Then, they should be reported to the competent authority for review and transfer to the Legislative Yuan for further discussion. Therefore, the Legislative Yuan only approved the case of Fujian Province's issuance of 3 million yuan of local construction public bonds on the 5th. The case of clearing old debt public bonds was not approved. (5th Instant Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

It is heard that after Doihara reports in Changchun, if the issue of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation becomes concrete, Doihara may still go to Beiping, Tianjin, and other places to negotiate everything with all parties. When Doihara passed through Shenyang, he issued a statement, roughly saying that after the resolution of the Hebei-Chahar and other issues, the economic circle in North China will inevitably present a vibrant appearance, so the future relationship between Japan and China is still quite optimistic.

<h3>Yugoslavia's Internal Stabilization Movement</h3>
<p>— Ang</p>
<p>The reorganization of the Yugoslav cabinet last month was the result of the unexpected success of the anti-government faction in the parliamentary re-election on May 5th. The deeper cause was the assassination of King Alexander on October 9th last year. Ever since the Marseilles Affair shocked the world, Yugoslavia has deeply felt the need for internal political reform. Thus, Wang Fubi, who had always been in a detached position, and Ye Fudi recruited figures from past and present parties to form a mixed cabinet. Now, with Finance Minister Situ Yadi, who sympathizes with the Croats, the so-called "Comfort Cabinet" has been organized. This cannot be said to be a major change in Yugoslavia's internal politics.</p>
<p>Yugoslavia is a newly emerging country after the war. Its domestic ethnic complexity is the highest among the Balkan countries. It currently has approximately 94,000 square miles of land, more than double that of Serbia before the war. The population is approximately 14 million, more than triple that of before the war. Domestic political problems have come with the expansion of national strength. At the beginning of its founding, it was originally based on Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes as the ethnic foundation, and the Corfu Treaty of 1917 as the political foundation, with the common support of the Hella George dynasty to implement a constitutional republic of the three ethnic groups. However, as things changed, the political ideologies of the Serbs and Croats tended to be extreme. The Serbs, with new enemies and old hatreds surrounding them on all sides, believed that they could not survive without centralized unification. The radical party, holding power, gradually became autocratic. The Croats and Slovenes, who were accustomed to German culture, regarded the Slavic culture of the Serbs as superior, and their belief in Roman Catholicism was opposed to the Greek Orthodox religion of the Serbs. Therefore, they were unwilling to be oppressed for a long time. Since the founding of Yugoslavia, the internal politics have been mired in open and secret struggles over the issue of centralization and decentralization, and there has been no peaceful day. During this period, cabinet members were murdered, party leaders were attacked, the Croatian province twice brewed independence, anti-government parties were repeatedly banned, the king personally exercised dictatorship, and the constitution was revised by decree, until the great outbreak of the Marseilles Affair in October last year.</p>
<p>The leader of the Croatian opposition party, Magiak, was imprisoned in January last year for demanding autonomy, but was pardoned after the Marseilles incident. People regarded this as a precursor to Yugoslavia's efforts to win back the people's hearts. When Ye Fudi formed a cabinet, he also issued a declaration of governing the country, advocating the equality of all people and planning to reform administrative agencies to make the provinces autonomous units, striving to implement a system of both centralization and decentralization under a unified government. Recently, the parliament has been re-elected, and all parties that were previously dissolved have been allowed to form new parties to engage in elections. From the surface, it seems that the internal situation has gradually become more compromised. In fact, the fundamental differences between the ethnic groups have not been quietly eliminated. The imperial constitution of 1931 has a provision that political parties must not be organized on the basis of religion or local boundaries, intending to disperse the strength of the opposition, which has been deeply resented by the Croats. Now, not only does this provision still exist, but during the election process, the official did not hesitate to use police force in the Croatian province to arrest a large number of opposition parties. Sixty-seven elected opposition members subsequently agreed not to go to the new parliament at a meeting in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia. When the cabinet tide rose again, the regent summoned the leader of the opposition party, Magiak, to Beijing for consultation. Magiak recommended that the Chief of the Army General Staff, Ye Guowei, organize a neutral cabinet and make the restoration of free elections to complete the constitutional parliament as its mission. Before the discussion was completed, Magiak quietly returned to Zagreb on the day the new cabinet of Situ Yadi was established. Is this not a manifestation that the three ethnic groups cannot fundamentally cooperate?</p>
<p>Although the new prime minister announced the general policy of the government to the parliament yesterday, saying that the government will formulate laws in accordance with public opinion so that the majority of the people can participate in the government, and sincerely requested the whole country to eliminate ethnic prejudices, stop political disputes, and cooperate in seeking the country. Since the new government has made this further expression in this stalemate, the three ethnic groups, which have always been uneasy, may not find it difficult to reorganize and unite under mutual understanding, and the ethnic problems of Yugoslavia may be solved from now on.</p>
<h3>Eliminating the East African War: British Active Diplomacy, the Crux of the Situation Lies in France's Attitude, and the King of Abyssinia's Request for Intervention Plunges America into a Predicament; the Kellogg-Briand Pact Faces Another Acid Test</h3>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister Laval held another meeting today with the British Ambassador regarding the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. According to news from diplomatic sources, the British government has already initiated diplomatic actions in various national capitals concerning the Abyssinian issue. (National Telegraph, 4th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Reuters has learned that the focus of the Italian-Abyssinian case has now shifted to Paris. The United Kingdom, as a member of the League of Nations, is cautiously inquiring based on its collective obligations. The UK's policy seems not to evade its obligations, but if other relevant countries refuse to share the burden, the UK does not want to bear the full responsibility alone. It is widely believed that the UK will not invoke Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant to initiate economic sanctions against the aggressor. The UK is currently striving to prevent the outbreak of war in Northeast Africa and is making it clear that it cannot be expected to bear any risks or actions that may arise in the process alone. No action will be taken without prior consultation with the Dominions. One of the issues that needs careful consideration is the possible impact of the Abyssinian war on other parts of Africa. Africans are now closely watching the progress of the dispute negotiations. The French government also attaches great importance to the Abyssinian issue, and its enthusiasm for eliminating war is no less than that of the UK. It is said that France's policy advocates staying away from the League of Nations, as Italy is extremely tense about this matter, and a slight mistake could easily provoke its anger. However, it will still strive to find a solution through direct negotiations. But it must be known now that the time for leisurely discussions is coming to an end. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>It was learned here today in the Abyssinian capital that the Abyssinian government has requested the United States to consider how to force Italy to comply with the Kellogg-Briand Pact. It is reported that this request was submitted to Mr. Henson, the U.S. Chargé d'Affaires here, for transmission to Washington. (National Telegraph, 4th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The State Department stated today that it has received Abyssinia's request for intervention in the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, as the United States, Italy, and Abyssinia are all signatories to the Kellogg Pact. According to reports, officials had previously denied receiving this request. Although this announcement has now been made, the authorities are still unwilling to make any comments. (National Telegraph, 4th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to political circles here today, the King of Abyssinia sent a petition yesterday to the American Chargé d'Affaires in Abyssinia, requesting the United States to invoke the Kellogg-Briand Pact regarding the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. Secretary of State Hull will carefully consider the reply. Well-informed sources feel that this document has placed the United States in a very difficult position. If the reply rejects this request, it will be seen as evading the obligations of the pact. If the United States invokes the pact, it could easily lead to a dispute with Italy. In view of the fact that the previous two times the pact was invoked were ineffective, it is widely believed that the only possible action the United States can take is to announce that the United States does not recognize the annexation of territory by force, as it did in the case of "Manchukuo." (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<h3>MacDonald Explains British Foreign Policy: Always Adhering to the Obligations of the League of Nations Covenant, the Cause of Peace Depends on International Cooperation</h3>
<p>(London) Lord President MacDonald recently gave a radio broadcast speech, responding to various criticisms from the outside world regarding the government's foreign policy, roughly saying, "The current international situation is difficult to be optimistic about, I know this very well, but the responsibility does not lie solely with the government of one country. The government of one country cannot force the actions of other countries' governments. Those who generally criticize the government's foreign policy often do not examine the facts carefully, as if all countries in the world except the United Kingdom have no freedom of action, and the United Kingdom can force countries like Germany, Italy, and Japan to obey its will, and all peace undertakings can be accomplished solely by us. If that were the case, wouldn't that be absurd? The British government's attitude at the League of Nations meetings and the negotiations in Paris, Rome, and Stresa has been clear. All voters who are willing to help create peace agree with this policy. Our British government's external actions have shown our determination to safeguard peace in more ways than one, and the resolution of the Saar issue is one of the most obvious examples. We have always adhered to the obligations of member states of the League of Nations and recognize that we should cooperate closely with the United States. We have done our best in the past to promote world peace, and we will certainly do our best to do so in the future," and so on. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>London Official Circles State That Economic Blockade Is Not Yet Being Discussed</h3>
<p>(London) It is widely rumored in Rome and Paris that if Italy insists on going to war with Abyssinia, the UK will take economic blockade measures. However, according to official circles here tonight, this approach is not yet being discussed. (National Telegraph, 5th)</p>
<h3>British Members of Parliament Ask Questions One After Another; Eden's Suggestion Arouses Repercussions</h3>
<p>(London) Recently, Minister Without Portfolio Eden, when he went to Rome, told Italian Prime Minister Mussolini that the UK was willing to cede a corner of British Somaliland to Abyssinia to provide it with an access to the sea. When the House of Commons met today, members of Parliament asked questions one after another. Colonial Secretary Malcolm MacDonald replied that the land mentioned in Eden's tentative suggestion was the port of Zeila, about fifty miles long and twelve miles wide, adjacent to the Abyssinian border. Its population is about three thousand in the summer and about seven thousand in the winter. The hinterland has no fixed residents, only nomadic tribes visit from time to time. Then Conservative MP Peter MacDonald asked the government that when re-mentioning this tentative suggestion, it should first seriously consider the panic that will arise among the tribesmen in various parts of the Empire, which was warmly welcomed by the entire House. The Colonial Secretary then reiterated that Eden's suggestion was conditional on British tribesmen enjoying water and grass rights on any land ceded by the UK to Italy and Abyssinia. Members continued to ask questions one after another, which was stopped by Speaker FitzRoy. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>Britain Wants to Rely on France; No Longer Opposes Eastern European Pact</h3>
<p>(London) According to well-informed sources, if Italy attacks Abyssinia and France assists British action in Geneva, the UK is prepared to consider a compromise with France on the issue of land and air armaments. It is now reported that the UK no longer opposes the conclusion of an Eastern European Pact. However, it is not yet known whether the UK is willing to assume clear obligations to maintain the independence of Austria. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>Maintaining the Credibility of the League of Nations: London People's Opinions Are Consistent</h3>
<p>(London) The Times commented on the current dispute between Italy and Abyssinia, believing that this case is a "European event and should naturally be resolved through diplomatic channels by the countries concerned in accordance with the principles contained in the League of Nations Covenant." There is no reason to be pessimistic, but the procedure stipulated in the London Declaration of February 3 by the UK and France has become more difficult to implement due to Italy's threat to Abyssinia. Maintaining the credibility of the League of Nations is of course a matter of urgency, but the UK's interests in the border areas of British Kenya, Somaliland, and Sudan in Africa, as well as the UK's position in Egypt, should also be taken into account at the same time. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian commented on the British government's policy on the Abyssinian issue, saying that as a member state of the League of Nations, the UK should assume collective obligations, but it has no individual obligations. "As far as the British people are concerned, the UK can only do something if other countries can fulfill the obligations of member states. The British people will not approve of the British government taking unilateral action." Some say that "the key to the situation lies in Paris," which is probably to shift the responsibility for preventing war to France. In fact, regardless of the outcome of the diplomatic strategies of various countries, the Abyssinian issue should still be discussed by the League of Nations. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) The League of Nations Association recently held a meeting in Cambridge. After discussing the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, it resolved to urge the cabinet to adopt the most stringent measures to maintain peace and preserve the supreme authority of the League of Nations in handling international disputes. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>France's Attitude: Willing to Consider Any Suggestions as Long as They Do Not Hinder Italian-French Friendship</h3>
<p>(Paris) British Ambassador Sir Clark visited Prime Minister Laval this afternoon. The British cabinet discussed the Abyssinian issue yesterday, and Clark's meeting with Laval was related to this issue. Diplomats pointed out that France is eager to find a peaceful solution to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. Prime Minister Laval stated in Geneva that he would be happy to put forward to Italy any suggestion that would resolve the Italian-Abyssinian dispute as long as it did not harm Italian-French friendship. France's attitude has not changed at present. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>(London) The British government is negotiating with France to seek joint British-French action to request economic sanctions from the League of Nations to resolve the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. Italian sources here believe that this British negotiation is only a diplomatic means, and the UK's real policy is not in this. British public opinion has recently been advocating the maintenance of the authority of the League of Nations, and the British cabinet's attitude is mostly influenced by this public opinion. Italian sources also believe that France will certainly not agree to adopt an unfriendly policy towards Italy. The UK's actions are at most to show public opinion that the British government has done its best to maintain peace. Even if the UK blockades the Suez Canal, Italy will not find it difficult to find foreign ships to transport Italian troops and military supplies to East Africa. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>Italy and France Have a Military Alliance</h3>
<p>(London) Several morning newspapers today published articles about the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, saying that France may not agree to apply sanctions to Italy because France recently signed a treaty with Italy, with an agreement attached, allowing Italy freedom of action in Abyssinia and stating that France has no interest in Abyssinia outside the railway area. This Franco-Italian agreement is essentially a military alliance, allowing the Franco-Italian general staff to greatly reduce their border defenses. Therefore, the military strength on the Franco-Italian border is very weak, and Italian troops can freely be transferred to Africa. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<h3>French Island in the Red Sea Ceded to Italy</h3>
<p>(Paris) According to British newspapers, the French government ceded the French island of Doumeira in the Red Sea to Italy. The island is located at the border between French Somaliland and Italian Eritrea. Recently, French Chief of Staff General Gamelin ceded the island to Italy during his visit to Rome. According to French officials, the island was ceded to Italy on January 7 this year and has nothing to do with the colonial agreement in the Franco-Italian agreement or the recent arms talks between the two countries. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<h3>French Newspapers Ridicule Britain's Contradictory Policy</h3>
<p>(Paris) French newspapers are now criticizing Britain's attitude towards the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, saying that Britain was unwilling to use the League of Nations Covenant to sanction Germany, but now it suddenly wants to invoke the Covenant for the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. Why is it so contradictory? Le Petit Parisien published an article by Pierre Berthé, saying that Britain is appealing to the League of Nations for an event that concerns the life and death of the League of Nations, its purpose is to defend the borders of Africa, not the borders of Europe. If France unwisely joins this undertaking, Italy will cite Hitler as a comrade. L'Oeuvre, a newspaper of the Radical Socialist Party, said that Britain's support for the League of Nations Covenant and sanctions is surprising, because not long ago, Britain signed the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and undermined the Treaty of Versailles. The newspaper also said that French Prime Minister Laval will certainly not abandon Italy. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<h3>Arbitration Committee Meeting: Listening to the Defense of the Italian Representative</h3>
<p>The Permanent Arbitration Committee on the Italian-Abyssinian dispute met yesterday in The Hague and heard the defense of Italian representative Professor Le Sasha Nai. Le asked the committee to specify the date, time, and location for the Italian side to summon native witnesses who had witnessed or heard about the Walwal incident to attend the meeting and describe the situation at that time. All witnesses will be flown to a designated location in Southern Europe. Members of the arbitration committee will go there to listen to the testimony and then return to Scheveningen to continue the meeting. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>Italian Newspapers Denounce Britain</h3>
<p>(Rome) After two weeks of silence, Italian newspapers today resumed their attacks on Britain. An editorial in "Il Giornale d'Italia" stated that Britain is carrying out propaganda on both the economic and political fronts in order to completely occupy Abyssinia. It is generally believed that since there are so many anti-British comments, Prime Minister Mussolini's order prohibiting Italian newspapers from attacking Britain has probably been lifted. (National Telegraph, 4th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italian newspapers today published comments again, criticizing Britain's attitude towards the Abyssinian issue. Corriere della Sera said, "Does Britain really want to uphold justice and fairness? Britain has been planning to manage Abyssinia for more than a day. At first, it tried to monopolize the water conservancy of Lake Tana, and then it established British trading bases in the Gambella area of Abyssinia, even setting up customs to collect taxes and building roads to monopolize the right to exploit the platinum mines in the area. Initially, a British financial group established the Abyssinian Silver Company, which led to the Abyssinian financial turmoil in 1929. Currently, the British are setting up a real estate company in Abyssinia in order to monopolize the development rights of the land around Lake Tana. Abyssinia has resisted the intrusion of foreign forces in every possible way. Later, the British government promised to give the Abyssinian government various concessions and allowed it to assist in Abyssinia's national defense. The establishment of this company was only accepted by the Abyssinian government. From this, it is not difficult to see Britain's intentions in maintaining justice." (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The local public opinion has been concerned about the issue of Britain's plan to use economic sanctions against Italy through the League of Nations when conflicts occur between Italy and Abyssinia in the future. The Il Popolo di Roma stated, "This is a threat to Italy from the UK and it will be very difficult to turn it into a reality." Il Giornale d'Italia stated, "Economic blockade cannot be implemented without the use of force. The UK's use of the League of Nations as a shield is only to set up a barrier for its own interests in order to cover up the gradual monopolization of Abyssinian territory. This monopolization action has already begun." Il Messaggero, after elaborating on Britain's various activities in Abyssinia, issued the conclusion that "Britain's ambition for Abyssinia was suddenly exposed and greatly hindered by Italy's actions. The world should know that the financial assistance that Britain gave to Abyssinia has been accepted by Abyssinia and used for military expenditures." (Havas, 5th)</p>
<h3>Results of Berlin Talks: Germany and Poland Maintain Friendly Relations, Review of General European Issues, Both Sides Largely Agree</h3>
<p>(Berlin) After Germany and Poland announced their friendship last year, the situation in Eastern Europe stabilized. Now, in order to further enhance friendship, Polish Foreign Minister Beck came to Berlin at the invitation of the German government. Today, he met with German Head of State Hitler. This is the first meeting between the leaders of the two countries since the adoption of a friendly policy. It is expected that Poland feels somewhat uneasy about the impact of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and wants to obtain assurances regarding the impact of this agreement on Germany's Baltic policy. After four hours of talks with Hitler, Beck issued a statement saying that the problem was discussed peacefully during the meeting, and other events related to the overall European situation, such as the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance agreement, etc. Beck said that the talk was an active contribution to the 1934 declaration. Last year's declaration has become an element of maintaining peace. The German government's bulletin said that the two sides conducted talks in an open spirit and agreed on many points. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Public Communique As Usual</p>
<p>(Berlin) The official statement released last night said that Polish Foreign Minister Beck stayed here for two days so that Prime Minister Hitler and German government officials could have the opportunity to discuss issues related to the two countries of Germany and Poland and general European policies in good faith. On the whole, the opinions of the two sides have been unified. It is also determined that the German-Polish Declaration of January 26, 1934, is not only conducive to the mutual relations between the two countries, but also an advisory element for maintaining European peace, and we are greatly honored. Foreign Minister Beck solemnly stated that Prime Minister Hitler's declaration on Poland on May 21 and his expectations for the permanent and unchanging German-Polish agreement have resonated with the Polish side. Poland also hopes that the good neighborly relations with Germany will improve day by day. The two governments know that the two countries are adjacent to each other and will continue to maintain close relations and do their best to promote peace in Europe. (National Telegraph, 4th)</p>
<p>The Scope of Understanding Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>(Berlin) When Polish Minister Beck talked with Head of State Hitler, it did not seem to plan for any hostile plans for any country, especially for the Soviet Union and France. Regarding the two issues of the Free City of Danzig and the Polish Corridor, Colonel Beck did not make clear statements. According to Polish sources, Poland still insists on maintaining the status quo for the existing borders in Europe and is unwilling to change them. As for Germany's rearmament, since it has been recognized by the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, Polish people are extremely uneasy about it. Colonel Beck was heard to have asked Head of State Hitler for assurances that the freedom of maritime traffic must be maintained under any circumstances. In that case, it is not difficult to infer the true scope of the understanding between Germany and Poland, that is, the existing outstanding cases of permanence between the two countries will not be damaged by these talks. As a result of the talks, only an agreement was reached to jointly seek a peaceful solution to the problem. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>Paris Pays Close Attention</p>
<p>(Paris) Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck's conversations with German Head of State Hitler have been kept secret. Newspapers are paying attention to them. "Le Journal" protested because Colonel Beck refused to meet with reporters from French newspapers, saying that "Colonel Beck's declaration to German reporters was quite vague and elusive. Therefore, the nature of the meeting between Beck and Hitler should not be exaggerated, but neither can it be underestimated." Le Matin said, "Although there were no concrete results from the talks, from the perspective of Poland's position, Colonel Beck's achievements on this trip should be important." L'Excelsior reported that "Beck's declaration was profound and, according to the impression of diplomats, was aimed at France." Famous political commentator Domeison published an article in Le Figaro commenting on the issue of treaty revision, saying, "Although the Third Reich now sees the German-Polish alliance as beneficial to it, it is not known how long it will last." (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>The Polish Press Expresses Gratification</p>
<p>Warsaw The Polish newspapers were satisfied with the Berlin side's warm welcome to Foreign Minister Beck. Most said that the Polish Foreign Minister's visit to Berlin was the first time since the eighteenth century, which shows that this move is indeed a proof of the emergence of a new era in Eastern Europe. The newspapers are especially pleased that Hitler personally responded to Beck's banquet. The Polish Daily newspaper stated in its editorial that the results of Foreign Minister's journey have fully proved that the good relationship created by the German-Polish non-aggression treaty has increased unabated, and there is absolutely no pessimism component. Polish express news said that the excellent treatment received by the Polish Foreign Minister in Pahlin this time may not have been such a gratifying result two years ago. Another military agency's newspaper stated that Beck's mission is not only extremely important for German-Polish relations, but also has a great impact on the European situation as a whole. Judging from the announcements published by the German newspaper, it can be seen that the purpose of Beck's trip has been fully achieved. Another newspaper believes that the views of the two countries have become more harmonious and consistent through this exchange. (National Telegraph, 5th)</p>
<p>Commemorating the Fallen Soldiers</p>
<p>(Berlin) Polish Foreign Minister Beck continued to exchange views with Foreign Minister Neurath yesterday. Mr. Beck then visited the Berlin Memorial Hall for Fallen Soldiers of the European War. Army Chief of Staff Blumberg, German Army Commander-in-Chief Fritsch, and other senior officials were all present to welcome him. After accepting the salute of the guards, Mr. Beck entered the memorial hall to lay a wreath and stood in silence for several minutes to commemorate the fallen soldiers of the European War. Yesterday, Polish Ambassador Lipski held a banquet. Prime Minister Hitler went to the embassy to thank the Polish Foreign Minister and also attended. The crowd in front of the embassy was cheering loudly. (National Telegraph, 4th)</p>
<h3>The Soviet Russian Navy Changes to Display a New Flag</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Russian Navy will henceforth display a new naval flag stipulated by the Central Executive Committee. Its style is a white background with a blue border below, with a five-pointed star in the middle and a hammer and sickle valley one. After this flag is used, the current red flag will be abolished.

<h3>The Soviet Union Again Expresses Approval to Japan for the Establishment of a Border Joint Committee; The Russian Ambassador and the Japanese Foreign Minister Talk for Two Hours; and Hope That Japan Will Study Specific Plans; Japan Believes That the Invasion of Russian Territory Is Not a Fact</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Soviet Ambassador to Japan Yurenev visited Foreign Minister Hirota at the Foreign Ministry at 3:20 pm on the 5th and reached two and a half hours. He held important consultations on the issue of protesting the so-called border crossing incident proposed by the Soviet Union and the establishment of a joint committee on the border between Manchuria and the Soviet Union. It is said that during the meeting, Ambassador Yurenev, according to the reply from his country's government, said that during the meeting between Hirota and Yurenev on the 26th of last month, Foreign Minister Hirota proposed the establishment of a committee to handle disputes on the border between Manchuria and the Soviet Union. The Soviet government replied that it recognized this proposal, but the future negotiation methods and its specific plan should be fully considered by the Soviet government, and it is hoped that Japan will also study it. Foreign Minister Hirota immediately notified "Manchukuo" of this understanding of the Soviet government's approval of the establishment of a border committee. Regarding the negotiation method, it must be fully agreed upon, and it has been replied in this way. The meeting on the 5th did not mention the start time and location of negotiations on the establishment of a border committee. However, after the three countries of Japan, Manchuria, and the Soviet Union fully agree on the above negotiation method, it is planned to start negotiations as soon as possible. The steps are roughly like this. As for Ambassador Yurenev's meeting on the 5th, he did not touch on the so-called issue of Japanese troops crossing the border that was raised by the Soviet Union. The previous telegram was wrong, so I would like to make a note of it. (Nichi-Rengo, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Ambassador to Manchuria Minami Jiro reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 5th that after Japanese and Manchurian officials received instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, they tried their best to investigate the truth about the border crossing incident by Japanese and Manchurian troops. However, as the Soviet government protested, such as Japanese and Manchurian soldiers crossing the border and warships invading Russia, etc., are not true. It is difficult to understand why the Soviet Union deliberately publicizes this kind of incident and protests to the Japanese government. Or it may be that the situation is favorable for the establishment of a joint border committee. (Nichi-Rengo, 5th)</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Air Defense Exercise in Japan</h3>
<p>To be held simultaneously in Tokyo, Kawasaki, and Yokohama from this morning until tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) From the 6th to the 7th, Tokyo, Kawasaki, and Yokohama will hold air defense exercises. Approximately 350,000 personnel from the three cities' defense corps will participate. In addition, numerous special defense corps from large stores, factories, temples, and women's groups will also participate. The exercise will begin around 11:00 AM on the 6th, simulating a scenario where several dozen aircraft from a certain country, loaded with incendiary bombs, attack Tokyo with the aim of bombing it. The defense corps will begin operations based on this scenario. Each district defense group will reinforce its designated area by 2:00 PM, aiming to completely defend Tokyo against dozens of simulated enemy aircraft. From 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM, these aircraft will be detected over the three cities, attempting to bomb the congested area around Shinjuku Station. The defense corps headquarters and district defense personnel will strive to rescue, provide fire protection, and evacuate from fires and injuries caused by the aircraft's bombing. At night, more than forty enemy aircraft, divided into over ten teams, will attack, dropping incendiary bombs everywhere. Citizens will completely enter alert and control until sunset. During each air raid, strict control measures will be implemented, plunging Tokyo into darkness to provide cover. Anti-aircraft guns and machine gun emplacements will be set up everywhere to repel the enemy aircraft. At dawn on the 7th, enemy aircraft will engage in a dawn battle with ground troops. During the blackout on the night of the 6th, no light will be allowed to leak from railways or any transportation facilities. These measures will be implemented, with vehicles operating in the darkened city, creating a realistic combat situation. As a result, Tokyo was already bustling with preparations for the air defense exercise on the 5th. (Jiji News Agency, 5th)</p>

<h3>Key Austrian Figures Travel to Italy and Hungary; Restoration Movement Takes Another Step</h3>
<p>(Vienna) Today, the Parliament has approved the government's decision to repeal the law exiling the Habsburg royal family and return their former assets. This is another step in Austria's move towards restoration. Simultaneously, Vice-Chancellor and leader of the Home Guard, Prince Starhemberg, flew to Rome today, widely believed to be to consult with Italian leader Mussolini regarding the recent developments concerning a possible Habsburg restoration. Furthermore, Defense Minister Vaugoins also flew to Budapest, the capital of Hungary, today, reportedly to meet with leaders of the Hungarian legitimist movement. (Reuters News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) The State Council's passage of the law repealing measures against the Habsburg royal family has caused a great stir in political circles here. It is now understood that the bill not only stipulates the restoration of the royal family's private property, but also, in principle, acknowledges the Habsburg royal family's right to return to the country. The Secretary-General of the State Council, Gawainski, along with several financial experts, is currently negotiating with representatives of the royal family residing in Belgium. The heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Archduke Otto, has been informed of the government's intentions. There is much discussion about the impact of Archduke Otto and Empress Zita's return on the political situation. Everyone is wondering when their return will take place. Well-informed sources believe it will be in the autumn. (National News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) The bill is currently being discussed by the Economic Council established under the January 1934 constitution. The amendments to the bill regarding the status of the Habsburg royal family are mainly in two areas: (1) Currently, members of the royal family traveling abroad must change their names. In the future, they can be issued Austrian government passports by Austrian authorities. (2) The state will provide the royal family with living expenses, even when residing abroad. However, the government currently does not favor any member of the royal family residing in Austria for a long time, and monarchists also do not advocate for immediate restoration to avoid international difficulties for the government. (Havas News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Archduke Otto declared in Belgium that he would not return to Vienna unless he could ascend the throne. However, this point is still uncertain. (National News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>Foreign Minister's Statement: (Vienna) After the State Council meeting, Foreign Minister Weidigg explained that the bill has nothing to do with restoration. "I believe the issue of restoration is not yet timely. The Austrian government has always adopted an honest and transparent approach. Austria will not take any steps that could cause disputes in Europe. This should be trusted by foreign countries. Therefore, foreign countries should not object to the bill presented today," he said. (Havas News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>Reactions from Various Countries: (Paris) The repeal of the law exiling the Habsburg royal family, requested by the Austrian government, is considered inopportune by the local newspapers. Le Petit Parisien reported, "Under the current situation in Europe, the Austrian government should have avoided such a move, as Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia will see this as a prelude to the restoration of the Habsburg royal family. This is a pretext for war that the Little Entente countries can invoke." L'Écho de Paris believes that the situation in Central Europe may become complicated. Le Populaire, the Socialist newspaper, stated, "If the Austrian government's move is used as a pretext for restoration in the near future, it will inevitably lead to a serious crisis of war." The Communist Party's organ "L'Humanité" said that the Austrian government's move is a threat to peace. Le Journal published a statement by Weissner, the leader of the Austrian monarchists, stating, "The only way to stabilize the situation in Austria and maintain its independence is to restore the traditional monarchy. The successors of the Austro-Hungarian Empire need not doubt the Habsburg royal family's return to the throne, as this is the only way to prevent the development of Pan-Germanism." L'Excelsior said, "Austria cannot survive independently of its neighboring countries and should not offend them, which Austria deeply knows. Austria is courageous and courteous, and has no provocative behavior towards any country." (Havas News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Yugoslav ambassador to France, Spalajković, visited Premier and Foreign Minister Laval this morning, reportedly to discuss Austria's repeal of the order exiling the Habsburg royal family. According to responsible sources, Laval made a statement on March 15 to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate, stating that the French government's policy on the restoration of the Habsburg royal family is completely the same as that of the Little Entente countries. France's attitude has not changed to this day, but it believes that the measures taken by Austria this time are only related to Austria's internal affairs, so there is no need to take any diplomatic steps. It is regrettable that Austria has taken such measures under the current circumstances, as it is feared that this will cause disputes in Central Europe and hinder the signing of the Danube Pact. (Havas News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Regarding the issue of the Habsburg royal family's restoration in Austria, Italy does not object, but because this matter may cause a backlash from the Little Entente countries, and to achieve the success of the Danube Conference, Italy must reach an agreement with the Little Entente. Therefore, Italy is currently taking a cautious stance. It is rumored that Austrian Vice-Chancellor Starhemberg is on his way to Italy. According to official statements, it has become a tradition for Starhemberg to come to Italy every year to inspect the Austrian youth summer training camp. This visit was not arranged in advance and has nothing to do with the Habsburg restoration issue. (Havas News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>Prague: Regarding the Austrian government's request to amend the law exiling the Habsburg royal family, responsible sources in the Czech government believe that it will not affect the Austrian political system. However, if this matter leads to the issue of restoration, the Little Entente countries will have a strong reaction. According to indirect sources, Empress Zita, the former queen of Austria, and Archduke Otto, the heir to the throne, have not benefited from the government's bill. As for the returned property, it is only privately owned by the royal family, and the former royal property is not included. (Havas News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>Belgrade: Yugoslav political figures believe that the Austrian government's proposal to amend the law exiling the Habsburg royal family is the first step in Austria's preparation for restoration, and they express surprise and unease. (Havas News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>The Demise of a Royal Grandson: (Berlin) After the Austrian government abolished the law against the Habsburg royal family, there was hope for the royal family to rise again. However, Archduke Ferdinand, a key figure in the royal family, unfortunately passed away here today at the age of 66. His later years were very bleak. Thirty years ago, he renounced his title and became a commoner, changing his name to Hoferlin. He initially served as a colonel in the Austrian army. In 1902, he fell in love with a young actress and wanted to marry her, so he resolutely renounced his hereditary rights and title, changing his name to Hoferlin. He then left Austria and returned to Switzerland. In 1907, he divorced his wife. Soon after, he fell out with the royal family. Not only was his throne not guaranteed, but all of his royal private property was confiscated by the government. As a result, he became extremely poor. In order to make a living, he later worked as a cafe waiter, journalist, insurance salesman, shop assistant, etc. He wandered from Switzerland to Berlin to Vienna, leading a nomadic life. Eventually, he returned to Berlin. Several years later, he married another woman. In addition to several books, his writings mainly consisted of short pieces about the Viennese royal family.

<h3>The Big Name Secret Society Incident is Resolved Through Mediation; Peaceful Resolution Expected</h3>

<h3>Central Government Sends Personnel to Estimate the Renovation of the Confucius Temple in Qufu</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Tang Wencong and Zhong Lingxiu returned to Beijing after going to Shandong to estimate the cost of renovating the Confucius Temple. Tang stated that the estimated budget for the renovation of the Confucius Temple is over 1.1 million yuan. The original plan by the Shandong Construction Department required 890,000 yuan.

Outside of the Confucius Temple, the attached areas, such as the renovation of the Yan Temple (estimated at over 40,000 yuan), the road surface from the Confucius Temple to the Confucius Forest (estimated at tens of thousands of yuan), and the road from Yanzhou to Qufu (estimated at over 80,000 yuan), are necessary to renovate at the same time, as these places are essential routes for Chinese and foreign visitors to the Confucius Temple. Furthermore, 100,000 yuan is needed for the workers' pay, and 50,000 yuan is tentatively set aside for design and supervision fees over two years, totaling approximately 1.1 million yuan. The Central Government previously discussed allocating 200,000 yuan, with the remainder to be apportioned among the provinces according to the same ratio used for the construction of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum.

<h3>Tax-Exempt Passports for Foreign Rice Are Sold at a Discount by Officials and Merchants</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Citizens such as Xu Yisai submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance stating that some officials and gentry who had obtained tax-exempt passports to import foreign rice were not actually selling the rice at a fair price.

They also provided a copy and serial number of a passport obtained in Liu'an, requesting that the Jianghai Customs and other customs offices be instructed to detain any such passports encountered.

<h3>Shang Zhen Arrives in Beiping to Prepare to Take Office in Baoding</h3>
<p>Discusses the gradual improvement of the North China situation and will frequently travel between Tianjin and Baoding after taking office.</p>
<p>(Beiping Correspondence) Shang Zhen, the newly appointed Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, arrived in Beiping last night (3rd) from Tianjin after handing over the duties of Acting Mayor of Tianjin. At 7:00 PM that evening, Wang Kemin, the Acting Chairman of the Beiping Political Reorganization Committee, hosted a banquet for Shang at the Guest House. This morning (4th) at 7:00 AM, Shang visited Xiao Zhenying, the Chairman of the Chahar Provincial Committee, and then Qin Dechun, the Acting Chairman of Chahar Province, at North Military Horse Division to have cordial talks. Around 9:00 AM, he went to the Temple of Heaven to preside over the graduation ceremony of the second class of the 32nd Army's non-commissioned officer training course. He returned to his residence at 11:00 AM and met with reporters, discussing everything freely. An account of his remarks is as follows. Shang first discussed the date of his departure for Baoding to take office. It is not yet fixed because the new provincial department heads of Hebei Province, such as Li Peiji, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department, He Hongji, the Director of the Education Department, Lu Xian, the Director of the Construction Department, and Committee members Nan Guixin, Liu Yinan, and Liang Ziqing, have all arrived in Beiping one after another. Li Jingrong, the Director of the Finance Department, is still in Hankao and is awaiting his trip north. Committee member Zhang Yinwu will arrive in Beiping from Boye within the next few days. The departure date for Baoding can be determined after all the department heads and committee members have arrived and all affairs in Beiping have been arranged. It may be as late as next week. The date of taking office can only be determined after arriving in Baoding. Regarding the reforms to be made in Hebei Province, he plans to carefully formulate plans after taking office and assessing the needs. He is prepared to go with Director Lu to inspect various parts of the province in the near future to understand the people's situation. He has been away from political life for a long time, and he will do his best to work hard. He will personally inspect the three counties of Dongming, Changyuan, and Puyang, which were flooded last year, in order to plan relief efforts. Regarding the situation in North China, after the diplomatic issues have been resolved, things have gradually improved. Because both sides have been sincere in the past, the future situation will inevitably improve further, and Hebei Province can calmly engage in construction under stable conditions. This is what he hopes for. The bandits in Fengtai have been completely suppressed, and there is no need to worry about the security of Beiping and Tongzhou. The whereabouts of the bandit leader Bai Jianwu have been reported to have been expelled by the authorities of the Japanese concession in Tianjin. Rumors that Shi Yousan and Hao Peng have been active recently are probably not true. As far as he knows, they are residing in Tianjin and have not been active. Finally, Shang said that after taking office in Baoding, he will frequently travel between Tianjin and Baoding because he also needs to personally oversee the Tianjin-Guzhen Security Headquarters. One division of his troops is currently stationed in Lutai, east of Tianjin, one division is stationed between Beiping and Tianjin, and only a small number are stationed in Baoding. The headquarters of the 32nd Army will remain in Beiping for ease of command. In order to facilitate office work, the Hebei Provincial Government has decided to establish an office in Tianjin, and the position of director will be selected from those with experience in handling local diplomacy.

<h3>Rampant Society Bandits in Daming</h3>
<p>Occupy police stations, arbitrarily intercept and rob, surround county towns, and cut off communications.</p>
<p>(Tianjin Correspondence) The people in the counties under the jurisdiction of the Daoming district in southern Hebei are strong and aggressive. In recent years, due to successive droughts and poor harvests, and because the soil of the area is barren and infertile, the residents have been privately setting up salt ponds to boil saltpeter for sale in various places to make a living. Since last year, the Changlu Tax Police Bureau, under the order of the Changlu Salt Transport Commissioner's Office, dispatched a large force to forcibly destroy the private salt ponds for the sake of maintaining administrative authority. The residents, because their source of livelihood was cut off, gathered to resist. The local Red Spear Society, Yellow Sand Society, Big Sword Society, and Heavenly Gate Society organizations, which practice heresy, gather thousands of people into a group. Because the tax police filled in the saltpeter ponds, they all rose up to confront them. Zhao Dehuai and Zhao Derong, brothers and leaders of the Red Spear Society in Jiematou Village, Er District, Daming County, took the opportunity to incite the ignorant masses with the words of resisting taxes, rejecting officials, and abolishing various burdens on farmers, forming the Yellow Sand Society Jin Sheng Dao, occupying dozens of villages in the territory of Er District, and dividing Er District to confront the government. They secretly contacted the Big Sword Society and Red Spear Society in various parts of eastern Shandong, taking each other as support. Saltpeter smugglers and starving people from Handan, Xingtai, Quzhou, and Jize also rose up in response, forming various illegal organizations. As a result, the power of the society bandits spread extremely widely, and Daming secretly held the power to issue orders and control everything. On the 25th of last month, Zhao Dehuai suddenly led 2,000 members to seize the Zhen'an Public Security Sub-Bureau. Shang Xun, the Chief of the Shuangmiaoji Sub-Bureau, Jin Bochang Qiu Rugang, and the Squad Leader Huang Fusan are all missing and are rumored to have been killed. After the bandits occupied the various villages and towns, they stationed two to three hundred society bandits in each place and posted slogans, leaflets, and notices everywhere. Zhao Dehuai called himself the Commander-in-Chief of the Baoda People's Autonomous Army and established a headquarters in Shuangmiaoji. Many treacherous people from various places went to join him, and his momentum was great. Jin Taji and Shuangmiaoji are wharves on the banks of the Pangwei River. After the bandits occupied them, they looted passing ships. The Tianjin Fukang Shoufeng Flour Company purchased 1,400 bags of wheat from southern Hebei, which were all looted by the bandits in Jin Taji. The losses of other goods transported to various places by water are countless. At the end of last month, the Magistrate of Daming County sent someone to invite Zhao Jinsheng, the nephew of Zhao Dehuai, to the county town to conduct peaceful negotiations. After Zhao Jinsheng arrived, the county magistrate, Cheng Yanheng, detained him as a hostage because the long-distance telephones of Daming, Xingtai, Jize, and Quzhou were cut off by the bandits, demanding that Zhao Dehuai come to see him. This aroused the anger of the bandits, and on the 29th of last month, they besieged Daming, sealing off external communications. Most of the society bandits moved to Dongtushan, five li away from the county town. There was a major shock in the city. Guo Xipeng's troops of the 4th Cavalry Division stationed in Daming contacted the tax police and militia to tightly close the four gates for defense. County Magistrate Cheng sent a telegram to the Hebei Provincial Government for emergency assistance and personally led the police and militia to defend. The society bandits claimed that they must occupy Daming as a base. The Hebei Provincial Government has sent two Special Commissioners to investigate and arrived in Daming on the first of this month. They met with Guo Xipeng and Cheng Tingheng to discuss countermeasures and planned to first ask the local gentry to come forward to mediate. If it can be resolved without the use of force, that would be the best, but if forced by the situation, they would have to suppress them. (3rd)</p>

According to the latest survey, the disaster areas in the West River counties are the most widespread in Sihui, Guangning, Gaoyao, and Gaoming, followed by Sanshui and Nanhai, and then Heshan and Zhongshan.

In Guangning County, the riverbanks of over 100 townships in the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and ninth districts have suffered collapsed houses and submerged rice fields, with losses of hundreds of thousands of yuan and over 100,000 disaster victims. The disaster is unprecedented in decades. In Gaoyao, in addition to the disasters reported previously, Chitangwei in the ninth district also collapsed. The total loss of rice in the county is about 600,000 to 700,000 yuan, with 60,000 to 70,000 disaster victims. In Gaoming County, 13 weirs collapsed, and about 60,000 mu of rice fields were flooded, with 70,000 to 80,000 disaster victims. On the 20th, Chen Dengwei in the fifth district also collapsed, and on the 24th, Sanzhouwei in the sixth district collapsed over twenty zhang after unsuccessful attempts to rescue it, turning dozens of villages into a swamp. In the Yier Water County, in addition to the collapsed weirs, Qian County, Kuigangwei, Lubaowei, Mumianwei, and Qianguowei were all in danger in mid-June. Fortunately, officials, civilians, and defense forces were mobilized to rescue them. Termite nests were plugged with wooden stakes and sandbags. After three or four days and nights, they were turned from danger to safety. In Nanhai County, Biyuanwei, Dachawei, Dongcunwei, Shaliwei, and Yinkengwei in the first district, Fuzhouwei, Tiewei, Shawei, and Shanmenwei in the seventh district, all had breaches, and 50% of the rice fields were flooded. In addition, in the second district, Nangun Chongfuwei, in the third district, Wucha and Dakengbei, and in the fifth district, Wangzhi and Liang'an, all had floodwaters invading, and in the tenth district, Cunyuanwei also had floodwaters invading. In Heshan County, on June 21st, floodwaters rose sharply, and on the 23rd, they rose even higher. The water depth at the county office's head gate was so deep that it submerged the top. Yuanzhouwei in Louchong Township in the first district had a breach of over a zhang, and the outside of the weir was a vast expanse of water. Yuetangwei was rescued by over 300 people for two days and nights, avoiding collapse. The other Xiashan Township, Xiwei, Shuikouwei, Kucaowanwei, Guzhongwei, and Luojiangwei all had small breaches. Shagu Road, Shatao Road, Shalong Road, Longgu Road, and Longjin Road in the county were all damaged by floodwaters, with bridges and roadbeds destroyed, and passenger vehicles were temporarily suspended. The loss of rice is about one-fifth. In Zhongshan County, after the 20th of last month, the central sea of Xiaolan Town in the third district and the area around Dahuangpu Doumen had 7 to 8 chi of water on the ground, or even over a zhang deep. Houses, fish ponds, and rice fields in the district were completely submerged. Overseas Chinese merchants in Hong Kong have recently donated funds for relief distribution.</p>
<p>After the authorities received reports from various counties, the Civil Affairs Department has allocated 1,000 yuan each for Guangning, Sihui, and Gaoyao to provide disaster relief. On the 28th of last month, the Renai Charity Hall sent a relief team with 30,000 catties of white rice to Sihui and Guangning counties to provide relief. On the 29th, they purchased another 70 bags of rice and sent personnel to Gaoming and Gaoyao counties to provide relief to the refugees in the disaster area. (July 1st)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Procedures for Rectifying Disaster Relief Transportation by Train</h3>
<p>The Songjiang Branch of the Red Cross Society sent off the fifth group of disaster victims from Zhejiang on April 15th, totaling 1,891 people, to Xiashi. On April 21st, they sent off the sixth group of disaster victims, totaling 3,029 people. All were transported by train allocated by the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations. A telegram was sent to the Zhejiang Provincial Government to put the matter on record. Now, the branch has received an official letter from the Railway Administration stating that the transportation procedures were agreed to be rectified after the event, but have not yet been received, and cannot be pending for long. The branch stated that when sending off each of the batches of refugees at that time, they received a respectful telegram from the Zhejiang Provincial Government, as well as a telegram to the Ministry of Railways to arrange train transportation back to their hometowns. They mistakenly believed that the two batches of disaster victims had already been reported by the Zhejiang Provincial Government to the Ministry of Railways for verification and transportation, and therefore did not complete the rectification procedures. They have now sent a special letter to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, earnestly requesting that it be quickly reported to the Ministry of Railways to order the Railway Administration to investigate and comply, in order to correct the procedures.</p>
<h3>Punishment for Fire on Steamer Mid-Voyage</h3>
<p>The Litong steamer, which operates between Tinglin and Songjiang, was rented from the Nanqiao Company. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 3rd, while sailing from Songjiang back to Tinglin, a fire suddenly broke out in the engine room between Yexie and Shengzimiao, engulfing the entire ship. Passengers panicked. Those who were strong swam away, while women and children cried in fear. Fortunately, the chief of the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau was on board and urged everyone to remain calm. He also brought the ship alongside the shore, allowing women and children to escape the danger. The ship and the cargo were destroyed by the fire. The chief mechanic, Hu Yuxiang, was not on board and hired Xu Abing as a substitute. The assistant mechanic, Wu Xianglin, suffered burns to his left shoulder. It is reported that the cause of the fire was a leaking water pipe, which caused the engine to overheat. Sparks fell into the gasoline, leading to an uncontrollable situation. The chief mechanic, Hu Yuxiang, is difficult to exonerate, and the county government has already transferred the case to the local court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Candle Industry Labor-Capital Dispute Over Salary Reduction</h3>
<p>The Wuxian Candle Industry Association, recognizing the recent decline in business and the difficulty for each store to maintain operations, resolved through industry discussion that all workers in each store would have their salaries reduced by 20% and the monthly allowance would be cancelled. Upon hearing this news, the workers in each store were extremely panicked and convened a meeting of representatives from each store on the 5th. After unanimous public resolution, they firmly rejected the capital side's salary reduction conditions. The capital side also held a meeting on the 5th, believing that salaries must be reduced in order to save expenses. Both parties have now submitted their cases to the county party headquarters, requesting relief. The party headquarters will convene a mediation meeting within days.</p>

After interrogation, a letter was sent to Zhang Shifa in Nanjing to identify her. Unexpectedly, after the letter reached Nanjing, it was returned to the bureau, stating that Ms. Liu had not behaved properly by running away with someone. If she were allowed to go home on her own, it might be inappropriate. Therefore, Ms. Liu was sent to the relief home for temporary care, awaiting her husband to come to Yangzhou to identify her and reunite them.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Detective Team Captures Two Notorious Bandits</h3>
<p>The detective team of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau received a report on the 28th of last month that the ringleaders of the Babaidu kidnapping case and the Jiu Fuzhu Shop robbery case, Chuan Tianzi (i.e., Chuan Dianyuan) and Zhang Zhengcai, were hiding in the Puliuzhou area of Shierwei, Yizheng. Many detectives were dispatched to proceed in the rain. They were arrested and searched, and one gun and ammunition were found. Bandit Chuan attempted to escape but was shot in the buttocks. Two boatmen involved in the same case, Li Shi and He Shi, were also arrested. They confessed to both cases and stated that the kidnapping case of Yin Liquan's family at the Hongqiao Bridge in Yangzhou was also committed by them. Since accomplices are still at large, they will be arrested and the cases will be submitted to the Garrison Headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Qixia Sues Case to Zhenjiang for Appeal</h3>
<p>The Qixia Mountain Rural Normal School and the monks of Qixia Temple had a dispute over land, and both sides used violence, resulting in injuries. Both went to the Jiangning Court to request injury examination. After the criminal court of the court summoned them four times, the monks and students were each fined ten yuan on the 29th of last month. Both parties refused to accept the judgment. The monks hired lawyer Chen Changzhi, and the rural teachers hired lawyer Meng Puqing to write a petition to the Fifth Branch of the High Court to file an appeal. It has been submitted yesterday. This case is the first criminal appeal case from the Jiangning Court's Zhenjiang Branch.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Yuping Road to Shangrao by Mid-Month</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was previously disrupted due to flash floods along the line that destroyed bridges, road surfaces, steel rails, and other projects. Now, all repairs have been completed. Passenger cars from Hangzhou to Yushan have been selling tickets directly since the 5th. The night express train has also resumed at the same time. The floods along the Yuping Road in Yushan, Shangrao, Guixi, and Youqing County have gradually receded, and construction is proceeding as usual. Track laying has passed the Shadu area and is only twenty miles from Shangrao. It is expected to reach Shangrao by the middle of this month. The Nanchang Main Factory, planned for the road, has purchased civilian land ten miles south of Nanchang to design factory buildings for construction. The capital is currently set at over 700,000 yuan, and some machinery has arrived from Germany.</p>
<h3>All Banks Have Sales Surplus</h3>
<p>More than 20 banks in Hangzhou have completed their previous settlements and are open as usual, all with surpluses. The exact numbers are as follows: China and Local banks, each 180,000 yuan; Central, Communications, and Xingye banks, each 90,000 yuan; Jianye 80,000 yuan; Shiye 40,000 yuan; Zhongnan, Salt, and Agricultural and Industrial banks, each 20,000 yuan; Chufeng, Savings, and Zhongshi banks, each 10,000 yuan; Dianye, Huidi, and Tongyi banks, each 5,000 yuan. In addition, the newly established Farmers, Liangzhe, and Jianghai banks each had a surplus of 2,000 yuan or more. The surpluses of the branches and offices in each county are not included in the calculation.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing: Extension of the Foil Monopoly</h3>
<p>Due to the stagnation of sales of tin foil, a major product of Shaoxing, the tax revenue has been greatly affected. The Department of Finance has decided to implement a provincial-wide foil monopoly within the 24th year to increase revenue. As the monopoly method is a new creation and is jointly run by officials and merchants, the preparatory work is time-consuming. It will not be established according to the original date. The inaugural meeting will be held on July 10th, and implementation will begin in August. The monopoly foil company will also be established on August 1st.</p>
<h3>Haimen: The Strike at Dasheng No. 3 Factory Resolved</h3>
<p>The Dasheng No. 3 Factory in Chang Lezhen, Sanqu, experienced a strike on the 7th of last month due to layoffs and wage reductions. Despite repeated persuasion by party and government agencies, work has not resumed and has been delayed until now, almost a month. On the 3rd, Zhang Gongren, the party affairs instructor of the Fourth District of Sanqu, formulated seven solutions and ordered the county party headquarters to follow them. The solutions are as follows: (1) Dasheng No. 3 Factory should resume work within three days. (2) The overall reduction in work standards should be at 88%. (3) Female workers who give birth will receive a subsidy of five yuan from the factory, and the evening shift allowance is set at four cents. On national memorial days, if there is no holiday, wages should be increased by half (i.e., one and a half times the wage). (4) The eight workers in custody will be released on bail. (5) Factory staff may join the union in accordance with the law. (6) If the factory encounters any situation in which workers are arrested in the future, it should be submitted to both the party and government for handling, and should not be executed without authorization. (7) After work resumes, workers must not stop work to make demands again. If there are any suggestions for improvement on both the labor and capital sides, they should be formally discussed with the factory through the union. Both labor and capital sides are satisfied with the plan, and the factory has decided to resume work on the 5th.</p>

<h3>Mayor Wu: A Message to Citizens on Promoting Literacy Education - Expressing Sincere and Eager Expectations for Citizens and Literacy Teachers</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Government has designated this year as the Year of Social Construction, and deeply believes that literacy education is the starting point for revitalizing the nation, enriching national strength, and building society, it resolutely plans to universally promote literacy education in this city starting from July 1st this year, with the goal of empowering the city's 500,000 illiterate people with the opportunity to receive education and become literate within one year, so as to directly improve their intelligence and indirectly enrich the strength of the nation's struggle for survival. At the same time, in the spirit of quick and practical work, since the establishment of the Literacy Education Committee, various preparatory tasks such as surveying illiterates, dividing educational districts, compiling textbooks, and training teachers have all been prepared before the end of June, and classes will officially begin on July 1st. I once said that July 1st of the 24th year is the most meaningful and memorable day in the history of education in this city. Now, at the beginning of classes, I would like to express my feelings to all citizens of the city and the teachers who are working on literacy education, and express my sincere and eager expectations for them. (1) Expectations for illiterate citizens: The only important target of literacy education in this city is, of course, illiterate citizens. The reason why we want to forcibly promote literacy education is not to interfere with your freedom, but to fulfill the obligations that a modern government should fulfill. In other words, it is entirely for your own personal benefit. This literacy education movement is especially a rare and unmissable opportunity for you. Some people instinctively feel the difficulty of the livelihood of the common people and thus doubt the need for literacy education. However, they do not know that the greatest function of literacy education lies in enhancing the knowledge and ability of the common people, which is precisely the fundamental and effective way to solve their livelihood difficulties and improve their living standards. (2) Expectations for literate citizens: The target of the literacy education movement is indeed illiterate citizens, but promoting literacy education is also the responsibility that we who are literate should share. If you want to establish yourself, establish others; if you want to succeed, help others succeed. In terms of social solidarity, whether the lives of the majority of common people are stable or healthy is not only closely related to us, but also a problem that we should pay attention to together. If we look at the problems of China from the innermost layer, it is only by improving the intellectual ability of the majority of the people that we can cultivate the vitality of the country, inspire the strength of society, promote the development of various industries, improve the livelihood of the people, and raise the status of the nation. Therefore, I have repeatedly said that literacy education is the basic work of saving and building the country. In this important sense, I want to eagerly hope that the literate citizens of this city will not stand idly by, but should bravely arouse their enthusiasm for educating and saving the people, and take on this important task of saving and building the country to the best of their ability. (3) Expectations for all literacy teachers: Those who bear the direct responsibility for promoting literacy education in this city are, of course, all literacy teachers. Therefore, the success or failure of the literacy education movement in this city, or the quality of the results, naturally depends on whether all literacy teachers can work diligently and earnestly. Because of this, in addition to strict selection, we have also trained them in advance, hoping that all teachers will not forget the purpose of our training, and do not forget the mission you have been entrusted with. Your coming is not for status, not for remuneration, in other words, not for rights, but for service, for fulfilling responsibility, for saving the people, and for saving the country. Life should be for the purpose of service, and we should aspire to do great things. Since literacy education is the basic work of saving and building the country, the mission that you have been entrusted with is truly great and should not be belittled. I hope that everyone will be mindful of the suffering of the people and the difficulties of the country, and consistently work with the motivation and purpose of establishing oneself to establish others, achieving oneself to help others achieve, and saving oneself to save the country, with the spirit and perseverance of sincerity, patience, and tireless teaching, to complete this most practical and basic great cause of saving and building the country.</p>
<h3>Fu Rulin Discusses Flood Control Work Along the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the water level in various sections of the Yangtze River has been rising continuously, and the situation is quite serious. In order to understand the truth, the reporter visited Fu Rulin, chairman of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission, at his residence yesterday. According to him, when the National Economic Commission merged the national water conservancy agencies last year, it was stipulated that the provinces and cities along the Yangtze River should plan their own flood control and dike repair work. However, flood control work is extremely important. How should provinces and cities be contacted between provinces? How should they cooperate in sections? How should the dikes be raised and thickened? In order to coordinate the overall situation, the Central Government, two months ago, the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission convened the authorities in charge of water conservancy in the provinces and cities along the Yangtze River to hold a flood control meeting. Detailed discussions were held on flood control work. For example, how the dike repair work should be carried out by the provinces and cities along the Yangtze River, and how the funds should be planned, were discussed separately at the meeting. In recent months, the water level of the Yangtze River has risen, and the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission has notified the provinces and cities along the Yangtze River to pay special attention. Now that the river water continues to rise, the government is naturally paying great attention. The Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission will send engineer Zhu Gonggan and engineers to various ports to conduct on-site inspections and urge the water conservancy personnel of the provinces and cities along the Yangtze River to actively carry out their work so that the floods will not cause disasters.</p>
<h3>Chu Minyi Discusses The Good Progress of President Wang's Medical Treatment But the Dangerous Period Has Not Yet Passed Four Weeks of Treatment Are Still Needed After the Fever Subsides</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the reporter recently interviewed Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, and asked about President Wang's condition. According to him, President Wang arrived in Shanghai on Monday (the 1st). Due to severe pain in his gallbladder, he was unable to get out of bed. When he got off the train in Zhenru, he went directly to Noel Hospital in a Red Cross car. The doctor ordered absolute rest in order to make the treatment effective. Therefore, he has refused to see guests for several days. I (Chu said of himself, according to the note, Chu is also a doctor) went to the hospital with Dr. Noel this afternoon to visit him. When I saw President Wang, I was afraid of tiring his spirit, so I did not talk to him. The bed on which President Wang was lying was propped up with wood, with the end of the bed about five or six inches higher than the head of the bed. According to Dr. Noel, this is to prevent the liver from pressing down on the gallbladder, so that the bile in the bile duct can flow easily. After I left, Dr. Noel said again that the President's gallbladder is still inflamed, and the temperature is still around 38 degrees. It is not yet known whether it will become a gallbladder abscess. We are now trying our best to avoid surgery. According to the treatment in recent days, the progress has been better, but the dangerous period has not yet passed. What we need to pay the most attention to is that even if the fever has subsided and the dangerous period has passed, four weeks of strict treatment are still needed. Because the source of the disease in the gallbladder has not been removed, and there are still diseases such as diabetes and gastrointestinal problems, the situation is complicated and must be treated from the root.</p>

<h3>The Shanghai-Wuxi Road Will Be Completed by the Deadline of Ordinary People Vehicle service will begin on August 1</h3>
<p>The company has stipulated fares for the entire line, and will hold regular exams for recruiting drivers.</p>
<p>According to Da Gong News Agency, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has set a deadline of July 15 for the completion of all the construction work on the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway. The Shanghai-Wuxi long-distance bus, which runs on the road, has decided to officially open to traffic on August 1. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Construction to Be Completed on Schedule</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Wuxi Highway is the first main line of transportation in Jiangnan, with a total length of more than 140 kilometers. Since the construction was supervised by the Highway Administration Office of the Jiangsu Construction Department in April last year, it was originally scheduled to be completed in February of this year. However, due to the inability to complete the construction in time, it has not been completed yet. Now, the Construction Department believes that this project cannot be delayed any longer, and is supervising the construction day and night. Yesterday, it also notified the Shanghai-Wuxi Long-Distance Bus Company that all projects must be completed by July 15.</p>
<p>Vehicle Service to Begin on August 1</p>
<p>After receiving the notice from the Construction Department, the Shanghai-Wuxi Long-Distance Bus Company has been actively preparing for the opening of traffic. All the vehicles needed have been assembled. The stations along the way, except for the Shanghai main station which cannot be completed as scheduled and a temporary station is being built, the stations in all the towns and cities along the way must be completed by July 15. According to Wu Zhongheng, director of the transportation department of the company, the board of directors of the company has decided to officially open to traffic on August 1. The Suzhou-Changshu branch line will also be opened to traffic at the same time, and there will be no further delays.</p>
<p>Fares for Each Station Stipulated</p>
<p>There are a total of 24 towns between Shanghai and Wuxi, including Shanghai, Luyang, Nanxiang, Malu, Shigangmen, Jiading, Waigang, Gelongzhen, Xinfeng, Taicang, Shuangfeng, Zhitang, Yaozhen, Zhitang, Baimao, Gulicun, Donghu, Donggang, Changshu, Liantang, Yangjian, Anbo, Dongting, Wuxi, and Zhoushanbang. The fares have been stipulated by the company. Shanghai to Wuxi is 140 kilometers, at 3 cents per kilometer, totaling 4.10 yuan. During the opening period, there is a 20% discount, totaling 3.36 yuan. The rest can be inferred in the same way. There is also the Suzhou-Changshu branch line, which passes through nine towns including Changshu, Mochen, Xinzhuang, Wuta, Jiejing, Weijing, Tangqiao, Lumu, and Suzhou. The fare for the entire trip is 94 cents.</p>
<p>Recruiting 60 Drivers</p>
<p>As the Shanghai-Wuxi Long-Distance Bus Company is about to open to traffic, it has temporarily begun recruiting 60 drivers since July 1. Many people have been enthusiastically signing up at the company's preparatory office on the second floor of No. 666 Beijing Road in recent days. The company has now decided to hold an examination at Nanyang Middle School, Rihui Bridge, Longhua Road, from the 16th to the 20th, from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM daily.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over Competitive Sales by Chinese Alcohol Factories; Ministry Urges Industry to Negotiate</h3>
<p>The Federation of Machine-Made National Product Factories submitted a petition to the Ministry of Industry of the Central People's Livelihood Movement Committee, requesting a halt to the drastic price reductions by the China Alcohol Factory, which were harming fellow businesses. The original text stated: "To the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the Guidance Committee for the People's Movement, and the Ministry of Industry of the National Government, sirs: We, the Meilong Alcohol Factory, the Zhonghua Alcohol Factory, and the Xiaguang Alcohol Factory, respectfully submit this joint letter. It has come to our attention that alcohol has historically been an imported product. It was only when the Meilong Alcohol Factory began manufacturing in the thirteenth year of the Republic that we began to have domestic goods. However, even then, only a small amount was produced for self-use. It was not until the winter of the twenty-second year of the Republic that production was expanded, with a daily output of 1,500 gallons of alcohol. The Zhonghua Alcohol Factory was also established in the same year, with a daily output of 600 gallons of alcohol. The Xiaguang Alcohol Factory was established in the spring of the twenty-third year of the Republic, with a daily output of 300 to 400 gallons of alcohol. The raw materials are all domestic agricultural products. As for the price of alcohol, it has been between $1.50 and $1.60 per gallon, with a cost of between $0.80 and $1.20. After deducting various special expenses, a small profit can still be made. Our factories have always adhered to the principle of harmony and mutual assistance in pricing, maintaining each other's interests. However, since March of the twenty-third year of the Republic, the Ministry of Industry approved the request of the China Alcohol Factory and issued a notice to the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, prohibiting the establishment of any new alcohol factories in the region, in order to protect the existing ones. Factories that had already been established were required to manufacture within their original production capacity and were not allowed to expand production any further, so as to avoid unnecessary competition. They were also given one month to register with the Ministry, with any factories established after that period being treated as newly established factories. On March 2nd of the same year, the Bureau of Social Affairs published an announcement in the Xin Shen Bao newspapers, document number 242, restricting the production of established factories to their original capacity and prohibiting further expansion. Our factories have complied with the order and registered accordingly.</p>
<p>However, in August of the twenty-fourth year, the foreign-owned Far East Alcohol Factory and the Pacific Alcohol Factory were established one after the other, with production capacities of 400 gallons and 500 gallons respectively. These factories were located in the concessions and did not register with the Ministry of Industry, and the deadline for registration has already passed. Furthermore, the China Alcohol Factory, which was founded by overseas Chinese, has been away from the motherland for a long time and is not aware of the situation. Initially, its products (in March of this year) were sold for $1.50 per gallon, but the actual price was secretly $1.40. In less than two months, the price has been reduced repeatedly. Currently, each gallon is sold for only $0.98 to $0.96, with an actual secret price of $0.85. This kind of disruptive market behavior is even more drastic and rapid than foreign dumping. As a result, the Xiaguang and Zhonghua Alcohol Factories have been forced to suspend operations, and the Meilong Factory is also suffering considerable damage. Even the China Alcohol Factory itself is feeling the effects of the losses. It has been found that the factory's production capacity, which was originally 4,000 gallons, has now been increased to 7,000 gallons, and it has been widely reported in the newspapers that it will soon have a production capacity of 15,000 gallons per day. As mentioned above, the factory is not only deceiving its fellow businesses and disrupting the market by lowering prices, but also violating the government's public announcement on restrictions, recklessly producing in large quantities, and inciting unnecessary competition among domestic goods companies. Furthermore, the factory's manufacturing raw materials do not use domestic agricultural products, but instead rely on imported molasses, which is particularly contrary to the government's principles of promoting domestic goods and rescuing the rural economy. At a time when the rural economy is bankrupt, industry and commerce are declining, and foreign</p>
<p>dumping policies</p>
<p>are being closely watched, the factory has no long-term plans for industrial development, but relies solely on its strong financial resources to merge with domestic goods companies, creating an opportunity for foreign alcohol factories in the country to gain a foothold. It is heartbreaking to say. We, the undersigned factories, are compelled to state the details and jointly request your committee to take measures as a mainstay from the standpoint of the domestic goods group, so that our alcohol industry will not perish together. We look forward to your response with great anticipation."</p>
<p>After receiving the petition, the committee found that the current consumption of alcohol, according to statistics, is mostly used for industrial, medical, and fuel purposes in the local and foreign areas, amounting to 3,000 gallons per day. In the concessions, about 1,000 gallons are used for beverages, for a total sales volume of only 4,000 gallons per day. According to the production statistics of various factories, the difference between production and sales is too large, and the failure of domestic alcohol factories will become a reality. At the beginning of the establishment of the China Alcohol Factory, the Ministry of Industry issued a notice to all alcohol factories, requiring them to register within a time limit and prohibiting further expansion of production capacity, so as to avoid unnecessary competition. The Bureau of Social Affairs also published a public announcement with the same proposition. Therefore, the China Alcohol Factory has repeatedly expanded its production capacity and drastically reduced its prices, causing its fellow businesses to shut down and disregarding the notice as if it were nothing. This is not a blessing for the future of the domestic alcohol industry. The Association, in view of the fact that domestic industry and commerce are in a precarious situation, cannot remain silent. It is reasonable to report the situation to your committee and department, requesting you to summon the relevant alcohol factories to the Ministry as soon as possible to inquire about the actual situation, or to impose realistic restrictions on production and prices in accordance with the original plan, so as to avoid unnecessary competition and eliminate the resentment of fellow businesses, or to develop another unified plan to maintain the alcohol industry permanently. We are extremely grateful for your reliance.</p>
<p>Reply from the People's Movement Committee</p>
<p>The People's Movement Committee's reply number 10393 states: "Regarding the submission concerning the China Alcohol Factory's expansion of production capacity and drastic reduction of prices, which have caused fellow businesses to shut down, and requesting that the situation be stopped. Your telegram has been received. The Ministry of Industry has been instructed to investigate and handle the matter. Please be informed."</p>
<p>Reply from the Ministry of Industry</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry's reply number 12752 states: "A telegram on behalf of the Meilong Alcohol Factory, etc., requesting measures to be taken to stop the China Alcohol Factory from increasing production capacity and drastically reducing prices. Your telegram has been received. The China Alcohol Factory has been instructed to work together with the Association and other alcohol factories in the spirit of mutual assistance to discuss and proceed. Please notify the factories to convene a meeting for consultation and report the details of the consultation. This is the reply."</p>

<h3>Unprecedented Ocean Route: First Dutch Ship Did Not Arrive Yesterday</h3>
<p>Delayed by Fog, Arriving This Morning</p>
<p>The Royal Netherlands Mail Steamship Company, to facilitate transportation between Asia and Africa, has opened an unprecedented ocean route from Shanghai to South Africa and Shanghai to East Africa. The Shanghai Java Shipping Company has been appointed as the general manager. The first ship, the "Good Hope," departed from Hong Kong last month, passing through Bangkok, Singapore, Batavia, Looderi, Mauritus, Liulin, Datama Tiewei, Cuanpeng, Lulundun, Bolle, Shanyinba, Mombasa, Maxi, Singapore again, Hong Kong, and then arriving in Shanghai. The ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday morning, but was delayed by fog and will now arrive this morning. It is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the South Africa route on the 7th and arrive at the Cape of Good Hope in Africa on August 25th. It will return to Hong Kong on September 27th.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi Visited Song Yesterday to Exchange Important Opinions</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, drove to the private residence of Song Ziwen, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Council and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of China, on Qiqi Road at 4:30 PM yesterday to talk for about 45 minutes. It is reported that Kong's visit to Song was not only to discuss general financial issues, but also to exchange important opinions on central government affairs.</p>
<h3>Phone Rate Increase in Shanghai West and North Extra-Settlement Road Areas</h3>
<p>Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Informs the Company: No Rate Increase for Users in Those Areas</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company's increase in telephone rates has sparked strong opposition from all sectors. It is now reported that the business community has already requested the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to ask the Municipal Government to instruct the Bureau of Public Utilities to negotiate and stop the increase. As the matter is of great importance, the reporter went to the Bureau of Public Utilities to inquire about everything. He was informed that the Public Concession and the French Concession are giving serious consideration to the Shanghai Telephone Company's increase in telephone rates in the two special districts and are currently hiring experts to review the matter, hoping for a fair resolution. However, in the extra-settlement road areas of Shanghai West and Shanghai North, the sovereignty belongs to the Municipal Government. If the company needs to increase the telephone rates for telephones installed in those areas, it must first obtain the permission of the Municipal Government. Otherwise, all telephone users in the aforementioned areas must not be charged higher rates. The Bureau has already sent a letter to the company ordering it to comply.</p>
<h3>Jiang Lun: Public Apportionment Repeatedly Postponed</h3>
<p>Implementation Changed to Beginning on the 16th</p>
<p>The implementation date for the Yangtze River Six Companies' public apportionment of water transportation fees, which was postponed to the 8th of this month by the second meeting, has been telegraphed to all branch offices of the six companies along the Yangtze River for compliance. All procedures for foreign branch offices are also being rushed to be completed before the 8th. Unexpectedly, as the implementation date approached, another problem arose. A certain foreign shipping company among the six companies made a special request for an additional 185 deductions. The proposal created a hidden obstacle for the future of the public apportionment, and the implementation on the 8th once again became a pie in the sky.</p>
<p>Further Discussion and Postponement: Representatives of the other five Chinese and foreign shipping companies held another joint meeting to discuss how to resolve the situation. After discussing the matter all day, it was decided that the request made by the company was difficult to accept. Therefore, on the one hand, all companies were reconvened for further deliberation, and on the other hand, consultations were held with the company to find a way to resolve the situation. At the same time, it was publicly agreed to postpone the implementation date for the third time, changing it to the 16th of this month. A notice has been issued.</p>
<p>Notification to All Ports: Yesterday, the Chinese and foreign shipping companies within the Yangtze River Public Apportionment agreement issued an urgent notice to the branch offices in Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Anqing, Jiujiang, Hankou, Shashi, Yichang, etc., informing them that there had been another change in the Yangtze River Public Apportionment and that implementation on the 8th was no longer possible. Please have each branch office temporarily maintain the status quo.

<h3>"New Life Weekly" Case: Court Hearing on the 9th</h3>
<p>Police Make Every Effort to Search for Yi Shui; Arrest Warrant to Be Issued If Necessary</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, regarding the case of "New Life Weekly" publishing the "Interrupted Words of the Emperor," after the Second Branch of the High Court filed a lawsuit against Du Chongyuan, the person in charge of the publication, the hearing has been scheduled for the 9th. It is reported that the court believes that Yi Shui, the author of the article, must be summoned, and the patrol room has been ordered to summon him. However, as the patrol room does not know Yi Shui's address, it has been unable to summon him for the time being. Therefore, the court has notified the Public Security Bureau to assist in the summons. The Public Security Bureau has ordered all branch offices and stations to handle the matter strictly. According to the reporter's investigation, although the police of the Public Security Bureau have been searching for days, Yi Shui has not been summoned as of this time. It is reported that the Public Security Bureau and the patrol room have stepped up their search and will definitely arrest him for investigation. If necessary, an arrest warrant will be issued.</p>
<p>Reuters reported from Tokyo on the 5th that Foreign Minister Hirota reported to the Cabinet today on the negotiations between China and Japan regarding "New Life Weekly," saying that the negotiations are ongoing. However, according to sources here, China may readily accept Japan's request to resolve the case.</p>
<h3>Consul General in New York, Ye Keliang, Returns Home to Report for Duty</h3>
<p>Approximately 35,000 Overseas Chinese in New York, Many Unemployed Due to Economic Panic</p>
<p>Ye Keliang, our Consul General in New York, recently received an order from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to return home to report for duty and will be transferred to another post. Ye has now returned to Shanghai and is staying at the New Asia Hotel. He is scheduled to go to Nanjing next week to report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Yesterday, a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency interviewed Ye at the hotel. He spoke in detail about the recent situation of overseas Chinese in the United States, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Statistics: According to statistics from the Consulate General last year, there are currently approximately 80,000 Chinese residing in the United States. The distribution of the population is as follows: New York has the largest number, approximately 35,000; Chicago is second, approximately 21,000; San Francisco has approximately 5,000; and other ports have a total of approximately 20,000. Due to the impact of the global economic panic, most of the overseas Chinese in the United States are unemployed. In American factories, only members of labor unions can participate, and non-Caucasians are generally not allowed to join. Therefore, most overseas Chinese are employed in restaurants and laundries. Currently, the number of unemployed accounts for 40% of the total.</p>
<p>Business Situation: Regarding the business situation, China's past exports to the United States, such as tung oil, silk, tea, carpets, etc., are now being seized by Japan in the silk market and are declining daily. However, a portion of silk is still welcomed by the United States, as Chinese silk is resilient and cannot be matched by Japanese silk. However, the cost is high because we use manual labor, while Japan uses machines and is constantly improving. If our silk can be improved and catch up, there is still hope for recovery. In the past, the United States relied entirely on our country for the import of tung oil to supply industrial use. In recent years, the United States has planted tung trees in the dripping southern part, planting in three provinces. It has now been five years, and the results are said to be quite successful. In another five years (ten years of tung), oil can be produced. At that time, our country's tung oil exports to the United States will suffer a major blow.</p>
<p>Entering Nanjing Next Week: The relationship between the governments of China and the United States and the feelings of the overseas Chinese has always been strong. Although the United States' implementation of the silver policy has been unfavorable to us, this is their country's self-defense policy and is not intended to cause harm to China. The price of silver has now risen to one ounce, from $6.30 to $7.70, and will continue to rise in the future. Roosevelt's revival movement is being promoted with the support of the silver policy. Agricultural products have been able to increase prices, but other products have also plummeted, so the recession still shrouds the entire United States. Our overseas Chinese, affected by this, are experiencing an increasing number of unemployed. Our country's products shipped to the United States are being sold at prices that are too low and damaging to the cost, making it impossible to promote sales. Finally, Ye told the reporter that he is scheduled to enter Nanjing next week to report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<h3>British Railway Expert, Han Meng, Suggests Reducing Freight Rates on Both Railways</h3>
<p>Both Railway Bureaus Have Begun Research</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency, Major General Han Meng, a renowned British railway expert and senior advisor to the National Government, was invited by the National Government to China to inspect the national railway administration. Han Meng has now completed his inspection of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways and told Wu Shaozeng, Deputy Director of both railways, "The environment for both railways is becoming increasingly difficult due to the intense competition from waterways. Inland waterways, outer waterways, highways, and road construction are all very convenient for transportation. The only way to remedy the situation is to reduce freight rates. However, to reduce freight rates, transportation costs must be reduced. To reduce transportation costs, general expenses and storage fees must be reduced." Wu, Deputy Director of both railways, has now submitted the matter to the Freight Rate Research Committee of both railways for research.</p>
<h3>Ma Xiangbo Praises Zhang Taiyan's Lectures</h3>
<p>Mr. Ma Xiangbo, a 96-year-old man, wrote an article to promote Zhang Taiyan's lectures in Suzhou, saying: "Mr. Zhang Taiyan of Yuhang is a scholar of ancient learning and a great man of today. He lives in seclusion and has chosen to build his home in Suzhou. Now, at the request of his disciples, he has opened a lecture hall to teach. His disciples are all talented scholars and virtuous women. In this time of darkness and turmoil, they are studying the evolution of the universe, embodying benevolence to grow, and gathering for a joyous meeting. They are collecting from all schools of thought and delving into the six arts, establishing etiquette as the foundation and crowning human relations. It is expected that Zheng Gong's village will be ignorant, and Dong Zi's tent will have many wise strategies. I am delighted with this grand event and rejoice in my advanced age. I write this to celebrate those who come after us."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Transportation Announces the Sorting Out of Old Accounts of Various Telecommunications Administrations</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation accumulated a large number of old debts of various telecommunications administrations during the era of the Beijing government. Not only was the situation complex and the outside world unaware of the details, but the repayment of principal and interest was repeatedly delayed, and even without a solution. The government's credibility was greatly affected. Since the establishment of the National Government, the successive ministers of the Ministry of Transportation have attempted to sort out the matter, but no solution has been found. After Minister Zhu Jia-hua took office, he ordered the Telecommunications Administration to actively proceed with the sorting out of old debts. On the one hand, he negotiated with the major foreign creditors to reduce the principal and interest or to exempt the interest, and to agree on a method of repayment by installments. On the other hand, he prepared funds to repay on time. The total amount of all debts was approximately 64 million silver dollars, and the total amount of debts to be repaid was approximately 48.5 million silver dollars. After offsetting, the amount of debts waived by the creditors was approximately 15.5 million silver dollars. Since the sorting out, as of May of this year, the Telecommunications Administration has repaid various debts on schedule, totaling more than 900,000 silver dollars. The Ministry of Transportation is now making public the situation and amount of these old telecommunications debts, as it has never been disclosed to the outside world before. Even the responsible personnel in the Ministry were mostly unaware of the exact amount due to the complexity of the situation. Now that the sorting out has been completed, it should be disclosed to the public. Therefore, in mid-April, the Shanghai Lixin Accounting Firm and the British Kezuoshi Accounting Firm were entrusted to jointly examine these accounts and files and issue a certificate. The certificate will be published in Chinese and Western newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai. The Lixin Accounting Firm will also be entrusted to publish the detailed table of old debts of various telecommunications administrations that have been sorted out and the audit certificate. The certificate is recorded as follows: We have examined the accounts of the Ministry of Transportation of the National Government for the sorting out of old debts of various telecommunications administrations, and the attached "Overview of the Sorting Out of Old Debts of Various Telecommunications Administrations." The facts and debt amounts stated are consistent with the agreements and exchanges of letters between the Ministry of Transportation and the various creditors in the agreement for the liquidation of old debts, as verified by these accountants. We have also separately inquired with the various creditors and received confirmation that there are no errors. The debts paid since the signing of the new agreement have also been verified to be correct. We hereby certify.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang People's Education Hall to Hold New Invention Exhibition; Shanghai Office Opens to Collect Submissions</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial People's Education Hall, in order to promote cooperation between inventors and investors and to truly encourage the interest of Chinese people in scientific research, is requesting submissions from inventors across the country to hold a large-scale exhibition of new inventions by Chinese people. The method is to collect new products from inventors across the country, along with various related materials, such as the invention process, uses, manufacturing techniques, existing capital, or investment amount, factory equipment, or factory environment, and create charts for public exhibition. As inventors across the country are scattered in various places, collection is difficult. In addition to the cases that have obtained patent rights from the Ministry of Industry, we have already sent invitations based on the cases. For other inventions that have not yet been registered, or that are in the process of being submitted to the Ministry, or that have completed the procedures and are awaiting investment cooperation, in order to facilitate contact, in addition to the Zhejiang Provincial People's Education Hall in Hangzhou, a Shanghai office has been established at Yubinqi Chinese Typewriter Office, 2nd Floor, No. 115 Hankou Road, Shanghai. Starting today, we have begun collecting submissions. If inventors in this city or nearby have any questions, they can contact us nearby. It is reported that the opening of the exhibition is imminent. Those who wish to participate must do so quickly to avoid missing the opportunity.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yangtze River Steamer Jiangshun Damages a Pontoon Boat; Anchor Chains Snapped, Damage Significant; Personnel Dispatched for Inspection and Repairs</h3>
<p>The Jiangshun, a Yangtze River steamer of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, damaged a pontoon boat when docking in Nanjing on its voyage from Shanghai to Hankou. The damage was severe. Yesterday, the company dispatched personnel to Nanjing for inspection to prepare for repairs. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Damaged Pontoon Boat</p>
<p>The Jiangshun is the premier large Yangtze River steamer of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, classified as a first-class vessel. The steamer has a registered gross tonnage of 4,327 tons and operates on the Monday/Thursday regular schedule. The captain is an Englishman, W. McIlwaiu. On this voyage from Shanghai to Hankou, it was carrying a large amount of upstream cargo and many passengers. On the 4th of this month, the steamer arrived in Nanjing. As usual, it berthed alongside the wharf to load and unload cargo and embark and disembark passengers. As the captain was directing the docking, a large pontoon boat was moored alongside the Nanjing wharf, held in place by six large anchors, to facilitate the docking of Yangtze River steamers and the unloading of cargo. Unexpectedly, the Jiangshun, through an act of carelessness, collided heavily with the pontoon boat. The six massive anchor chains securing the pontoon boat were snapped by the Jiangshun. The anchors sank to the bottom of the river.</p>
<p>Pontoon Boat Adrift</p>
<p>With the anchor chains severed, the hull of the pontoon boat was also struck. The pontoon immediately broke its moorings and began to drift. The pontoon boat had a very large capacity, originally capable of carrying six to seven hundred tons of cargo. Emergency measures were immediately taken. Dockworkers towed the pontoon boat back to the wharf to prevent it from drifting away. A telegram was immediately sent to Shanghai to report the incident and request prompt repairs to the broken chains to avoid disrupting the regular schedule of steamers. The Jiangshun, due to schedule constraints, continued its voyage to Hankou after loading and unloading cargo and passengers, proceeding upstream as usual.</p>
<p>Personnel Dispatched for Inspection</p>
<p>Yesterday, after receiving a report from the Nanjing branch, the Shanghai head office then received a report from Captain McIlwaiu of the Jiangshun, along with a statement on the matter of responsibility for the collision with the pontoon boat. Upon receiving this information, the head office considered the matter to be of great consequence, and the extent of the damage was still unclear. General Manager Liu Hongsheng instructed the Shipping Department to promptly investigate the matter. The Shipping Department then appointed An Qibang, the head of the retained ship department, to travel to Nanjing yesterday to thoroughly inspect the damage and oversee the repair work. An departed for Nanjing yesterday.</p>
<h3>The Truth Behind the Suicide Jump of a Xin Xin Waitress; Stemmed from a Marriage Dispute; Argument with Mother Led to Separation</h3>
<p>Tao Guizhen (also known as Ah Feng, age 17), a waitress at the rooftop garden of the Xin Xin Company and a native of Changzhou, suddenly jumped from the roof around 9:00 PM the night before, committing suicide. This was previously reported in this newspaper. Subsequently, after the police from the Lao Zha district took the body to the funeral home on Avenue Petain for examination and dispatched detectives to investigate, it was learned that the woman's mother, Tao Zhang, currently resides at 131 Avenue Foch and earns a living by doing laundry. Previously, the mother and daughter lived together in peace. Unexpectedly, two months ago, the daughter had a dispute with her mother over her right to choose her own marriage partner. This caused a deep rift between the two. As a result, the daughter once attempted to swallow gold in a suicide attempt but was rescued. From then on, the daughter separated from her mother and rented a residence at 43 Mill Street in the French Concession with her close friends Wu Xiuying and Wang Qiaozhen. Around 7:00 PM the night before, she left home to work at the company. Later, a regular customer from Tianjin with the surname Wang came to the company and gave the woman two yuan without ordering tea, then abruptly left. Soon after, the woman suddenly jumped from the building, committing her second suicide attempt. It is unknown why she took this drastic measure. It is difficult to ascertain the reason for this suicide. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, arrived at the funeral home to examine the body. After briefly questioning the woman's mother, Guo concluded that the deceased, Tao Guizhen, female, died of a head injury sustained in a fall. The body was released to her mother, Tao Zhang, who signed a statement to take it back for burial.</p>
<h3>Case Against Cheng Linsheng and Others; All Failed to Appear in Court Yesterday; Lawyers Requested a Postponement</h3>
<p>Cheng Linsheng and Gan Yize, shareholders of the Gentae Hohe Flour Factory, and Li Quanshen, the manager, were recently sued in the First Special District Court by Xu Yiming, a Cantonese resident of 171 Tangshan Road, Lane 1, House 17, for forgery. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yang Zhaoxin of the First Special Court summoned them to the Eighth Criminal Court. All three defendants had lawyers appear in court, stating that Li Quanshen had a sudden case of diarrhea, Gan Yize had been ill for several days, and Cheng Linsheng had gone to Hangzhou on urgent business. All were unable to appear in court to answer the summons and requested a ten-day postponement. Judge Yang reviewed the request and, as the defendants had not appeared, it was difficult to proceed. He granted the defendants' request and announced a postponement.</p>
<h3>Juxingcheng Bank Embezzlement Case; Longtime Clerk Implicated; Sued Along with an Employee; Court Opened Hearing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Zhang Weiqi, an employee of the Juxingcheng Bank at 276 Jiujiang Road, suddenly abandoned his position and fled at the beginning of last month. After auditing the accounts, Director Yu Yuanhui discovered that Zhang had embezzled 49,126.32 yuan. It was also discovered that Zhang had an account under the name of the Jinti Trading Company at the Jin Cheng Bank, initially depositing 2,500 yuan, and with later transactions exceeding 20,000 yuan. The address listed for the Jinti Company was upstairs at Lin Ji's place on Mill Street. Yu investigated and found that the address was actually the residence of Yu Fujie, the head clerk of the Juxingcheng Bank. Believing that Zhang and Yu were jointly involved in the embezzlement, he sued Zhang and Yu in the First Special Court. After an initial summons, Zhang was ordered to be arrested. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yang Zhaoxin continued the hearing, ordering Yu Fujie to appear in court with his defense lawyer, Huang Yuping. According to Yu's testimony, the old clerks and servants of the bank were not allowed to disobey the orders of the bank if the bank had orders, so Zhang Weiqi instructed me to deposit the account at Jin Cheng Bank and write the address of the Jinti Company as my residence. I had no right to question it, and I only followed orders. I had no involvement in the embezzlement. Judge Yang stated that further investigation was needed and adjourned the hearing.</p>
<h3>Sister-in-Law Sues Brother-in-Law; Sister-in-Law Could Not Be Summoned for Court Hearing; Judge Instructed the Defendant to Help Find Her</h3>
<p>Shen Qianyuan, a Ningbo native from the Sanxing Tobacco Company at 71 Yulin Road, had a seven-year-old daughter after his wife, Rong, passed away. With no one to care for the child, he entrusted her to his sister-in-law, Rong Yuelan, who had married Shi Jianqing and lived at 7 Yulin Road. Shen visited his daughter frequently at his sister-in-law's house. Over time, he and Yuelan became involved. Recently, they had a daughter who is now ten months old. The two suddenly had a disagreement and became estranged. Rong Yuelan sued Shen in the First Special Court for abandoning her and their young child. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yang opened the Eighth Criminal Court to hear the case. According to the bailiff's report, Rong's address could not be found, so the summons could not be delivered. Therefore, Rong did not appear today. Shen appeared on time. According to his testimony, although he had a relationship with his sister-in-law, he did not know whether the child was his, because Rong had relationships with other men. He had already paid Rong 100 yuan to end the relationship, but now she was filing a lawsuit. The court believed that if the plaintiff did not appear, the litigation would inevitably be delayed. Therefore, the defendant was ordered to help find her and submit a report to the court after finding her. If her whereabouts could not be found, the court would issue a public notice according to law. The defendant, Shen Qianyuan, agreed to help find her and report back. Judge Yang adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<h3>Yan Luqing Imprisoned; Carried Dozens of Books; Prepared for Study in Prison</h3>
<p>Zhou Jinggeng, a comprador at the Schmeidel Accounting Firm at 9 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, had his office broken into and robbed of 12,000 yuan in cash on the afternoon of June 9th of last year. The case involved Zhang Zuming, Zhuang Jimeng, Wang Shuyou, Tang Qingyue, and others. The French police arrested them and prosecuted them in the Second Special District Court. The victim, Zhou Jinggeng, appointed lawyer Yan Luqing to appear in court and file a collateral private prosecution, seeking damages. Subsequently, Yan and Zhou extorted 60,000 yuan from the families of Zhang and Zhuang to settle the case but failed. They then extorted 2,000 yuan from the family of Tang. The families reported the matter to the French police, who investigated and confirmed the facts. The police department then filed a public prosecution against Yan Luqing in the Second Special Court for extortion. After a trial by Judge Xiong Huiping, Yan Luqing was sentenced to two years and six months in prison on July 28th of last year, fined 800 yuan, and deprived of public rights for five years. During the appeal period, he was allowed to leave on bail by paying 8,000 yuan. Meanwhile, the Disciplinary Committee of the High Branch Court of Lawyers proposed disciplinary action and decided to suspend Yan from his duties and notify the Shanghai Bar Association to remove him from membership. Yan refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the High Branch Court and the Supreme Court, but both courts rejected the appeal. The Supreme Court sent the case file and verdict to the High Branch Court, which dispatched police to deliver the verdict, as reported in this newspaper earlier. It is now learned that the execution warrant and judgment from the High Branch Court were delivered simultaneously, ordering Yan to report to the court for execution at 9:00 AM yesterday. Yesterday, Yan Luqing reported to the High Branch Court on time, carrying dozens of books, preparing to read and study in prison. Judge Xiong Huiping of the High Court opened the court, summoning Yan Luqing to the front. After briefly questioning his age and background, the judge informed him that the case had been appealed and rejected by the Supreme Court, confirming the original judgment. Today, he was being summoned to the court to execute the prison sentence and pay the fine. Yan responded in the affirmative and stated that his appeal was well-founded and that there was hope for a retrial. However, the court sent the reasons in the judgment, which did not result in a retrial, so he was dissatisfied. The judge then advised Yan that if new evidence were discovered, he could request a retrial. He then ordered the bailiffs to take Yan down and send him to the Second Special District Prison on Rue Massenet for execution.</p>
<h3>Case of Obscenity; Yang Jiaju Appealed; Concluded Hearing in Court Scheduled for Sentencing</h3>
<p>Yang Jiaju, son of Cantonese lawyer Yang Guoshu, was previously sued in the Criminal Court of the First Special Court by a woman named Shen Yuan for seducing her seventeen-year-old daughter, Shen Shu--, and committing obscenity. She also filed a civil suit seeking damages of 5,000 yuan. The Special Court concluded the hearing and acquitted Yang, dismissing the plaintiff's civil suit. It is now learned that Shen Yuan refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Second High Branch Court. Yesterday morning, Presiding Judge Yu Huating and Judges Xiao and Shi took the bench to hear the case. The appellant, Yang Jiaju, appeared in court with his representative lawyer, Liang Bohua. The plaintiff, Shen Yuan, did not attend due to illness. The appellant's representative lawyer then rose and stated the grounds for the appeal, divided into two points. The first point was that Yang Jiaju had seduced Shen Shuyun and taken her to the Nanjing Hotel to commit adultery without the appellant's consent. The second point was that Yang had written two notes, causing Shuyun to mistakenly believe that they had a marital relationship, and thus submit to his adultery. The appeal also included the civil suit. Next, Shen Shuyun testified that she was seventeen years old, from Suzhou, born on February 13th of the eighth year of the Republic of China. She currently lives with her mother at 4 Puyutang Street, Taoshachang, in the city. She has nine older siblings, all of whom are married. She is the youngest, the fourth sister. One of her sisters lives in Hong Kong. At the age of fourteen, she went to Hong Kong to study at Ying Wa Girls' School for three years. In August of last year, she dropped out of school and came to Shanghai because of her mother's illness. The defendant, Yang Jiaju, had previously met her when he was friends with her brother-in-law in Hong Kong. On December 5th of last year, she went to her sister's house to play. Yang suddenly called and asked if her sister was home. She replied that she was not. Yang said that her sister was waiting for her at the Dahua Ballroom and that he would pick her up in his car. A short time later, Yang arrived in his car. She unsuspectingly got into the car with him, and they went straight to the Dahua Ballroom. Because she did not see her sister, she wanted to go back. Yang then said that he would go out with her to look for her. She was lured to the Nanjing Hotel, where he committed adultery and broke her chastity. However, Yang stated at the time that he had no wife and was willing to marry her. She was misled by his sweet words and lost her virginity. The next day, they went together to Yang's office on the upper floor of the Shanghai Commercial Trust Company at the intersection of Henan Road and Beijing Road, where Yang wrote a note. Later, because Yang did not fulfill the agreement, she repeatedly went to his office to inquire. She was also repeatedly cheated on. Because the note written by Yang was not effective, she later went to lawyer He Sui to sign another contract, which was certified by lawyer He to prevent future changes. Unexpectedly, Yang still went back on his word, so she filed a lawsuit. She is now asking a lawyer to punish him, not to pursue financial compensation. At this point, the appellant's representative lawyer stood up and said that the case was independently filed by Shen Yuan as the legal guardian. According to her, Yang must compensate her for 5,000 yuan. Yang Jiaju testified that Shen's brother runs a brothel. Because he was forcing Shen to become a prostitute, Shen did not agree and asked me for help. She wanted to be a dancer. On December 5th of last year, I danced with Shen at the Dahua Ballroom and gave her 30 yuan. Afterwards, we spent the night together at the Nanjing Hotel. Later, because her brother intended to extort money, I dared not go out with Shen again. There was no adultery in the office. There are three people in my office, how could I do such a thing? This can be investigated. Under the arguments of the lawyers from both sides, Presiding Judge Yu adjourned the arguments and scheduled the sentencing for the morning of the 12th of this month.</p>
<h3>No. 6 Ferry Maiden Voyage; Night Run for Evening Cool Tonight</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Xingye Trust City Ferry Management Office's newly built No. 6 ferry has been under construction since spring and summer by the Hexing Machinery Manufacturing Factory. It was completed at the end of last month. The size and style of the boat are largely similar to the No. 5 ferry, but the sturdiness of the materials and the richness of the decorations are even better than the No. 5 ferry. The maximum speed can reach 13 knots per hour, which is even higher than all other ferries. The boat's interior layout has now been completed. It is scheduled to make its maiden voyage tonight (6th) and operate a night run for evening cool. It will depart from the Beijing Road pier at 8:30 PM. It is expected that ladies and gentlemen will travel together to enjoy the ride.</p>
<h3>Case of Fighting and Murder Between Two Chauffeurs; Friendship Turned to Enmity Over a Chess Game; Two Brawls Led to Tragedy</h3>
<p>Gu Wenquan, a native of Wuxi, was a chauffeur for a foreigner at the Great Northern Telegraph Company, driving car number 159. Sun Ganquan (also known as Li Afu) was also a chauffeur. The two cars often parked near 34 Avenue Edward VII, so they became good friends with close feelings. On the afternoon of the 28th of last month, Gu and Li, because their masters were in office, gathered to play chess to pass the time. Due to disagreements over the game, they clashed five times. They wrestled with each other three times, but others persuaded them to stop. At 2:40 PM, Sun argued with Gu again, and then they fought. At that time, Gu punched Sun in the face with his fists, causing Sun to lose his balance and fall to the ground. His head hit a piece of redwood on the ground, causing him to be injured and bleeding from his mouth and nose. After the police arrived, Sun was sent to the hospital for treatment, and Gu was detained in the general police station. After investigating, Detective Gao Yanrong of the Shanhua team sent Gu to the First Special Court, requesting detention. However, Sun died at 3:00 PM on the 29th due to his serious injuries. The prosecutor of the First Special Court confirmed that the death was caused by a fall after being beaten. Yesterday morning, the police sent Gu to the First Criminal Court. Police lawyer Ru Bao--- filed the indictment. According to the investigation, Gu did not intend to cause Sun's death, so he was charged under Article 279 of the new criminal code. The family of the deceased then hired lawyer Yan Yinwu to file a civil suit, requesting that Gu be ordered to compensate the deceased's monthly funeral expenses of 45 yuan for a period of ten years. Gu Wenquan testified that the deceased had repeatedly come to beat him, so he punched him in the face. He did not know if he hit him. Presiding Judge Feng Shide reviewed the testimony and, because the two witnesses had not arrived, he ordered a postponement.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Insists on Divorce; Unable to Bear Husband's Abuse; Judge's Mediation Fails</h3>
<p>Gu Jinlin, a local young woman in her early twenties with considerable beauty, was married to Huang Shouan, who ran a rice shop at 450 Qujiazhai, Gaoqiao Town, Pudong, through an arranged marriage. At the beginning of their marriage, the couple's relationship was fairly good. However, due to trivial family matters, they often quarreled. Recently, the couple's relationship deteriorated further. Therefore, Gu Jinlin could no longer bear it and hired lawyer Pan Zhensheng to file a lawsuit in the local court, requesting a divorce. The lawsuit stated that the defendant, Huang Shouan, was fond of wandering, did not work properly, and indulged in gambling, pawning all of the plaintiff's dowry and clothing. When she tried to persuade him, she was beaten. The defendant's mother, on the other hand, smoked opium all day and night. She often accused the plaintiff of not serving her properly and incited her three daughters to help her beat the plaintiff. She often forced the plaintiff to return to Ningbo to borrow money. If she did not comply, she would first scold the plaintiff for being useless, and then beat her. The defendant's mother and son knew that the plaintiff was covered in injuries, so they locked the bedroom and did not allow her to leave. After the injuries healed, she was restored to freedom. The plaintiff was in this human hell, and the abuse she suffered made it impossible to live together. She attempted suicide by jumping into the river several times, but was rescued. On December 15th of last year, she was forced to return to Ningbo to borrow money. Unexpectedly, after she returned home, the defendant falsely accused the plaintiff of committing adultery and fleeing, and reported her to the court. Fortunately, the court was fair and found her not guilty. The defendant's intention was to insult and harm her. In this situation, the couple's relationship was completely broken. Therefore, she was forced to request a divorce and the return of her dowry. After receiving the lawsuit, the court summoned both parties to a hearing yesterday morning at 8:30 AM by Judge Sun Jikang. Both the plaintiff and the defendant appeared in court with their lawyers. First, the plaintiff, Gu Jinlin, recounted the events and requested that the divorce be granted. Next, the defendant, Huang Shouan, testified that he was twenty-two years old and denied the plaintiff's allegations. He claimed that the plaintiff was lazy and spent all day gossiping and laughing with the neighbors, neglecting her household chores. He had repeatedly advised her that they were a small family and should not waste their time. Unexpectedly, the plaintiff not only did not listen, but also unreasonably made trouble for him. Earlier, she used the excuse of returning to Ningbo to visit relatives and did not return. He went to pick her up several times, but she hid and refused to see him. Recently, she listened to gossip and requested a divorce. However, he was a small businessman and it was not easy to marry a wife. The wedding cost a lot of money, and he asked for a chance for reconciliation. After hearing the testimony, the judge repeatedly tried to persuade both parties, but the plaintiff insisted on a divorce, and reconciliation was hopeless. The debate then began. The judge considered the matter concluded and scheduled the sentencing for 10:00 AM on the 10th.</p>

<p>After the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Naval Department had an embezzlement case involving official Feng Zifan, the Naval Department's military tribunal has already tried the case and sentenced Feng to four years and two months in prison. At the time, according to Feng's testimony, there were also two officials from the shipyard, Gao Zese and Shen Leifen, who were also suspected of being involved in the matter. Because Gao and Shen had already fled after the case, the Naval Department specifically ordered the shipyard to arrest them.

<p>The Fuhui Bank, located at 107 Gaobaolu Road, near the Eight Immortals Bridge in the French Concession, has been in business for less than two years.

It is also said that there is a criminal case against them under investigation.</p>

<h3>Progress of Jiangsu Agricultural Bank; Profit of Over 170,000 in the First Half of This Year</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank, which has always aimed to provide relief to rural areas, inherently cannot meticulously calculate profits and losses. However, in the current era of social depression, with the decline of all industries and economic hardship, all relief efforts rely on funding. Therefore, the bank, in addition to actively carrying out rural relief work, is also committed to increasing its working capital to enhance its ability to provide rural relief. It is reported that the bank's financial statement for the first half of this year shows a surplus of 173,310 yuan, exceeding the bank's surplus record for the first half of previous years. Furthermore, the bank's warehouse storage collateral this year has reached 5 million yuan, and loans for green crops have also reached 4 million yuan, all of which are provided to ordinary farmers with extremely low-interest funds or in-kind loans, which is of no small benefit to rural areas.</p>
<h3>First District Party Headquarters Suggests Banning Shop Names Using the Term "Overseas Chinese"; The Meaning of "Qiao" Refers to Being Abroad; Its Use Within the Country is Quite Inappropriate</h3>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, the First District Party Headquarters submitted a document to the Municipal Party Headquarters yesterday, stating: "The 27th Sub-branch has reported that various shops in the city often use the term 'Overseas Chinese' in their names, such as Overseas Chinese Sock Factory, Overseas Chinese Bathhouse, Overseas Chinese Store, etc. At first glance, it almost makes one wonder if Shanghai is not part of our country. Furthermore, the meaning of the term 'Qiao' originally refers to residing temporarily abroad. The combined term 'Overseas Chinese' is a common term for our people residing abroad. Conversely, people from England, America, and France residing in our country are also referred to as 'British Overseas Chinese,' 'American Overseas Chinese,' and 'French Overseas Chinese.' It would be appropriate for our people to establish shops abroad using the term 'Overseas Chinese,' but it is quite inappropriate to use it for shops located within our own country. It is not only unsightly but also creates controversy with neighboring countries. Upon examination, other domestic areas do not have such inappropriate and incongruous names. These shops are merely seeking peculiar names without considering the fundamental national identity, and it is necessary to ban them. It is requested that a strict order be issued to replace them within a limited time to improve appearances." The Municipal Party Headquarters, after receiving the report, considered the suggestion to be insightful and decided to send a letter to the Social Affairs Bureau for review.</p>
<h3>Municipal Defense Council Intensifies Political Training; Zhang Xiaotong Appointed as Political Training Officer</h3>

Zhang is an alternate supervisor of the Municipal Party Headquarters and has extensive political knowledge and experience. The council has already submitted a report to the Municipal Government for record yesterday and has issued separate orders to the defense corps in various districts to take note.</p>

<h3>Lawyers Association Submits Petition to Various Courts Requesting Attention to Safeguarding Lawyers' Duties; Fifty to Sixty People Storm Lawyers' Lounge; Lawyers Cannot Be Subject to Any Interference from the Opposing Party</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association submitted a petition to courts at all levels yesterday, stating: "Regarding the matter of respectfully requesting instructions to pay attention to safeguarding lawyers' duties: According to a letter from member Huang Han, 'Member was appointed by Cen Zhisheng and 65 others in a case against the Tongfu Company Rental Office in the District Court (Civil Case No. 10432 of the 23rd year). Han was commissioned by Ni Jingui of the defendant Tongfu Company Rental Office as a litigation agent. On the afternoon of the 20th of this month at 2 PM, Han appeared in court as an agent. After the court session, while Han was in the lawyers' lounge, suddenly 50 to 60 people from the plaintiff's side stormed into the lounge and questioned Han, saying that he should not attack the plaintiff. Han informed them that lawyers' defense and attacks in court are the lawful exercise of their duties, and if the opposing party has reasons, they can present them to the court. They have no right to illegally interfere. However, the plaintiffs, relying on their numbers and power, raised their hands as if to inflict violence on Han. Fortunately, other colleagues present and the plaintiff's attorney, Yu Hualong, intervened and prevented him from being harmed. The plaintiffs then shouted insults loudly in the corridor outside the lounge, threatening to harm Han. To prevent the situation from escalating, Han had to endure it temporarily. It is believed that lawyers represent litigation according to law, which is a duty entrusted by the state, and they cannot be subject to any interference or intimidation from the opposing party. If this is not stopped by law, lawyers will be threatened everywhere and unable to perform their duties. This matter concerns the interests of the entire legal profession, so we are reporting the facts and asking the association to take preventive measures against the aforementioned situation, and respectfully request a resolution on how to handle it.' The Executive and Supervisory Committee at its 198th joint meeting resolved to submit a petition to courts at all levels for attention and to notify all members. In addition to sending separate letters to all members, we are formally submitting this document to respectfully request your attention, which is in the public interest."</p>
<h3>Repatriated Overseas Chinese from Japan; Sixty-Sixth Batch Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday; Pan Jinmu and Others, Totaling Twenty-Five People</h3>
<p>The 66th batch of repatriated overseas Chinese from Japan, including Pan Jinmu, Ying Zha Dang, Wu Wenyuan, Zhang Shimao, Wu Jinfa, Zhu Zhenchang, Ye Zongqi, Wu Tiantang, Chen Lianxing, Li Kang, Huang Wenfa, Zhao Chonggan (all from Yongjia, Zhejiang), Lin Ruimei, Wang Chunzai (from Qingtian, Zhejiang), Wu Lianhe (from Guangdong), Lü Guangfa (from Shandong), and others totaling sixteen people, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM aboard the Japanese ship Rokkakumaru. They are staying at three inns: Sixteen Pei Laogongxin, Xin Gongxin, and Wanlai. According to the overseas Chinese, speaking to a reporter from the Nihon Mainichi Shimbun, there were a total of twenty-five people being repatriated this time. In addition to the sixteen mentioned above, the remaining nine are from Fujian and Ningbo, etc. They each have relatives in Shanghai, so they went to their relatives after disembarking. Currently, half of us will return to our hometowns, and half plan to work at the Overseas Chinese Amusement Village.</p>
<h3>The Crisis of Kala-Azar in Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Society on Rennie Road, despite its best efforts to appeal for assistance and provide aid due to the widespread drought last year, has yet to resolve the matter. Unexpectedly, a type of Kala-Azar (i.e. Spleen Enlargement Disease) has broken out in various counties of Northern Jiangsu this spring, which is even more severe than the drought. Once infected, death is certain sooner or later if not treated. The symptoms initially resemble malaria with fever and chills, followed by the formation of lumps in the abdomen. Over time, this progresses to loss of appetite, weakness and emaciation, abdominal pain, night sweats, bloody discharge, blindness, and rotting gums. Those afflicted with this disease are mostly young children and able-bodied adults. Initially, there were only a few cases, which then spread to each other. Recently, the number has grown to over 100,000 people, and the spread is rapid, becoming more widespread and turning villages into ruins. The entire society is facing a precarious situation. Currently, the deadly flames are gradually trending southward, and the future is truly frightening. Although there is a German injection solution that can effectively treat this disease, the medicine is very expensive and requires long-term injections. Treating one person's illness costs no less than dozens of yuan. Bankrupt villagers cannot afford this, and eight or nine out of ten die due to lack of funds for treatment. It has been heard that villagers, unable to afford treatment, are resorting to drawing lots to seek treatment. For example, if a village has Kala-Azar and fifteen people cannot afford treatment, each person will contribute one yuan in cash, accumulating fifteen yuan, and then draw lots. The winner will take this money for treatment, while the remaining fourteen people can only wait for death. What could be more tragic than this in the world? Mr. Wang Shuxiang, a respected member of Northern Jiangsu society, witnessing this tragedy, was deeply moved and painstakingly researched ancient prescriptions from various books. Finally, he fortunately obtained a secret prescription that has repeatedly proven to be remarkably effective, having already cured hundreds of people. Moreover, it is cost-effective and easy to administer, costing less than one yuan to save a life. As a result, patients from various counties, upon hearing this news, flock to seek treatment every day, bringing the elderly and the young. The tragic situation is unbearable to witness. However, Mr. Wang, limited by his personal financial resources, cannot provide treatment to everyone, and feels deeply distressed. Recently, he came to Shanghai in person to request assistance from the Society. However, the Society, having used all its relief funds to assist with last year's drought, can only lament its helplessness. However, if this disease is not quickly eradicated and allowed to spread, it will not only bankrupt the rural economy but also, over time, become a racial problem. It is hoped that kind-hearted people from all walks of life will quickly provide assistance to eliminate this catastrophe. It is reported that Mr. Wang is currently staying in Shanghai. Those interested in researching this prescription or providing financial assistance can inquire at the Society.</p>
<h3>Dr. Xia Qichang Returns to China; Arriving Today on the Conte Verde</h3>
<p>Mr. Xia Qichang, from Dangtu, Anhui, is 27 years old. He graduated from the medical department of St. John's University with a bachelor's degree and has worked at Tongren Hospital and Guangren Hospital in this city. Numerous patients have been cured by him and have praised him. However, Mr. Xia was determined to pursue advanced studies, so he went abroad to Austria last summer and entered the Poli Klinik hospital to specialize in research. He then went to America for practical training. It is reported that Mr. Xia has completed his studies and departed on the Italian ship Conte Verde on June 12th to return to China, and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today. Mr. Xia's relatives and friends will be welcoming him at the dock.</p>

<h3>Storyteller Assaulted by Ruffians; Sparked by Failed Extortion Attempt</h3>
<p>Shan Minggao, a native of Suzhou, has been setting up a storytelling stall near Tangshan Road on Avenue Edward VII, enjoying a thriving business. He attracted the attention of Shen Ronggen (from Ningbo), a local ruffian. The other day, Shen went to Shan and, under the guise of an excuse, extorted ten silver dollars from him. Shan only gave him thirty copper coins, which Shen refused, leading to a verbal altercation. Shen left in anger, saying, "Just wait and see." At around 8 PM that afternoon, Shan was still at the same location, performing his storytelling as usual. Shen Ronggen arrived with a person known as Xiao Mao. Without asking any questions, they dragged Shan out of the crowd and brutally beat him with fists and feet, knocking him to the ground. Xiao Mao then used the wooden signboard he was carrying to strike Shan's head and face repeatedly, causing profuse bleeding. Shan cried out for help. Police Constable No. 1914, upon hearing the alarm, rushed to the scene and arrested Shen. Xiao Mao escaped during the chaos. The injured Shan was taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment. The suspect Shen, along with the signboard, was taken to the Huishan Police Station, where the incident was reported to the station chief and ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Lawyer Wang Yaotang of the Shanghai Municipal Council stated the circumstances and added that his accomplice Xiao Mao was still at large, requesting a postponement. Subsequently, Constable No. 1914 presented the signboard for inspection. The victim, Chen Minggao, testified about the assault. When questioned, the defendant's testimony was evasive, claiming that he only asked the plaintiff for cigarette money and asking for leniency. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered him to be detained and scheduled a new date for investigation.</p>
<h3>Lu Shenfa, a Local, Entangled in a Cohabitation Dispute with a Female Tea Server; Falls Victim to a "Honey Trap"</h3>
<p>Wu Yueying, a 22-year-old woman from Hangzhou residing at No. 315 Avenue Foch, French Concession, is a female tea server at the New World Company rooftop amusement park on Nanjing Road. She is beautiful and has not been formally married, but she has many male admirers. Lu Shenfa, a local man from Changzhou, residing at No. 3 Linmaoli, Zhizaoju Road, Nanshi, who runs a leather wallet factory, is 29 years old and unmarried. Last month, while visiting the New World Company, he encountered the woman. After being seduced and charmed by her, Lu, considering himself unmarried and the woman seemingly willing to marry him, agreed to become her lover. On the evening of the 22nd of the same month, Lu spent the night at her home and began preparing to cohabit. On the morning of the 4th of this month, suddenly a gangster from Pudong, Wu Hongxiang (30 years old, resident of Caishi), along with several others, rushed to the woman's home. At the time, Lu and the woman were still in bed, not yet having gotten up. Wu immediately claimed to be the woman's husband and accused Lu of adultery with his wife. He first violently beat Lu and then dragged him to a teahouse, demanding 20 silver dollars to settle the matter. Afterwards, Lu believed that the woman and others had intentionally set up a "honey trap" to extort him, and he reported it to the French police. Detective Zhang Xueyong rushed to the woman's home on the morning of the 5th and arrested Wu Hongxiang and Wu Yueying. Yesterday, they were taken to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Lawyer Fei Xizhen of the Police Department requested a postponement of the investigation. Subsequently, the plaintiff, Lu Shenfa, testified, "Last month, I went to the New World Company and met the woman. She said she was not married and was willing to spend her days with me. Because I also have no wife, she asked me to go to her home. I also wanted to marry her. As for the night of the 2nd, I went because it was raining, and she asked me to stay overnight. The next day, she asked me to give her 5 dou of rice, intending to cohabit with her. Later, she wanted me to pay off her debts. Because I learned that she had sworn an oath to a foster father, I stopped going. Her foster father came and demanded 20 yuan from me. Wu Hongxiang also came out, claiming to be her husband, so I didn't dare go again. Later, someone persuaded me to still go and cohabit, guaranteeing that there would be no problems in the future. I felt relieved and went again, and also paid her rent of 14 yuan. On the evening of the 3rd, I stayed at the woman's house. On the morning of the 4th, Wu Hongxiang led many people to catch me in the act of adultery. First, he slapped me twice and then dragged me to the teahouse, demanding 100 yuan to settle the matter. Finally, I paid 20 yuan and was able to escape. Later, I thought that they intentionally set up a honey trap to deceive good people, so I was unwilling to accept it and reported it to the police," he said, completing his testimony with tears in his eyes, filled with endless sadness. Wu Hongxiang confessed that he had been in a relationship with Wu Yueying for three years. The rest of his statement was ambiguous. Wu Yueying testified that the plaintiff did not want her and that her manager, Xiao Nanjing, was asked to mediate and resolve the matter. There was no conspiracy to extort money. After reviewing the testimonies, Judge Li Changnian ordered a postponement of the hearing for ten days and ordered the defendants to be detained.</p>

After a while, he went out to buy a snack and, while at the entrance of the Tiantian Restaurant across the street, was suddenly surrounded by five or six strangers.

<h3>The Minsheng Paper Mill Lawsuit Continues</h3>
<p>Zhao Guanqing, the founder of the Minsheng Paper Mill in Zhabei, unintentionally decided to cease operations in November of the 19th year of the Republic and leased the factory grounds and all assets to Zheng Liucheng and others for operation. They changed the brand to Minsheng Yuji, with Ye Yinshan (son of Shanghai tycoon Zi Hongying) and Zhang Deming as internal responsible shareholders. Subsequently, Zheng and others violated the lease agreement, and in the 21st year, Zhao filed a lawsuit with the Shanghai District Court, requesting restoration to the original state and compensation for the arrears. A final judgment was made, and during the compulsory enforcement, the machines, etc., moved to the Shanghai Die Paper Mill by the defendants Zheng Yicheng and others, were seized and auctioned. The lawsuit has dragged on for several years and has not yet been resolved. Recently, Zhao Guanqing again filed a private lawsuit in the Criminal Court of the District Court, accusing Zheng Yicheng, Zhang Deming, Ye Yinshan, and others of fraud and damage, hiding property that should be subject to enforcement, assuming a sale, and obstructing creditor's rights. After several hearings by Judge Cai, the three defendants were ordered to each provide a solvent shop as bail for release pending further instructions. Details were previously reported extensively. It is now reported that Zhao Guanqing was severely beaten while accompanying enforcement officers. Zhao then hired someone to carry him to the court for a medical examination, claiming that he was instigated by Zhang Deming and others to have the workers assault him. Prosecutor Du Jiasheng confirmed that the injuries were real and instructed Zhao to seek medical treatment himself. The other day, Zhang Deming and Cai Qihou, the factory's bookkeeper, were summoned to court for investigation. After the investigation, they were ordered to be detained for further investigation. Yesterday morning, representatives from the Social Affairs Bureau, Tan Peiyan, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Yuan Hongjun, as well as Zhao Guanqing, who was still injured, were ordered to attend court, represented by his son Zhao Yangchun. After being interrogated by Prosecutor Du, Zhang Deming and Cai Qihou, who were in custody, were summoned again for further investigation. As a result, Zhang Deming and Cai Qihou were ordered to be returned to custody pending thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Bandits Executed in Qingpu County; Notification Received by French Police</h3>
<p>The Detective Team of the First District Maritime Public Security Division of Minhang, in conjunction with Chinese and Western detectives from the French police, cracked a kidnapping case last month at a woodwork shop behind the Great World amusement park. They apprehended Gao Changgen and Qian Mao Nu, the kidnappers of Shen Junchun's young son, A'gang, from Zhujiazhuang, Qingpu County, and rescued the hostage, Shen A'gang. However, the son of a Mr. Jiang from Bei Wangbang had already been killed and his body abandoned in the river. The kidnappers were immediately extradited to the Songjiang County Public Security Bureau, where Detective Team Leader Yang Shijie took the two bandits back to Songjiang and then transferred them to the Qingpu County Government. After interrogation and confirmation of the facts, they were sentenced to death. The sentence was submitted to the Provincial Government for approval and then telegraphed for execution. On the morning of the 30th of last month, Qingpu County detectives escorted Gao and Qian to the scene of the crime and executed them by firing squad. Yesterday, the Qingpu County Public Security Bureau sent a letter to the French police requesting confirmation.</p>
<h3>Carelessness Causes Fire at Fuxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory on Lujiabang Road; Bookkeeper Detained for Investigation</h3>
<p>The Fuxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory at No. 1070 Lujiabang Road, Nanshi, was jointly established by Lu Jinquan and others from Shaoxing in the first month of last year. Unfortunately, at around 2:30 AM yesterday, the electric wires inside the dyeing workshop at the back of the factory, due to disrepair over the years, caused an electrical short circuit and ignited a shed. The fire spread rapidly. Police officers on patrol from the Sanguantang Police Station of the West Gate Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau noticed the fire and immediately reported it to the fire departments in various districts via telephone. Fire trucks rushed to the scene to extinguish the fire. The fire was extinguished after about half an hour. A shed was destroyed, with minor losses. Due to the chaotic scene, Police Chief Zhang Yaodong led police to maintain order and investigate the cause of the fire, taking the bookkeeper from Shaoxing, Xu Zihong, to the station for questioning. It is reported that the factory had fire insurance coverage of 30,000 yuan with Tianyi and Baofeng Insurance companies.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Hotel Guest Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>A guest came to the Great Shanghai Hotel on Nanjing Road, Xiangfen Lane, a few days ago, claiming to be Liu Jun, a local, 30 years old. He stayed in room 401 on the fourth floor. Observing his behavior, he seemed to be quite financially strained. Unexpectedly, at around 10:30 AM yesterday morning, the tea server on that floor suddenly heard moaning from the room. He knocked on the door, but there was no response for a long time. Realizing something was wrong, he quickly reported to the front desk, who opened the door and entered the room. They found him lying stiff on the bed, unconscious. Traces of poison were left near his pillow, indicating suicide by poisoning. They urgently reported to the police station, who sent him to the hospital, but he died due to severe poisoning before he could be treated. The body was immediately sent to the coroner's office for examination. They are currently searching for the family members, but the deceased's name is uncertain, making the investigation difficult. Since the Central Bank built the Qiujiang Road Wharf, the demand for land in the city center has increased sharply, mainly because the land price there is low, all kinds of public facilities are complete, the transportation is very convenient, and the hope of future development is great. Although the current market is sluggish, and the real estate prices in the concession have plummeted, the land price there has risen instead, because the original price was already low, and the future prospects are high. Now, those who talk about real estate all recognize the land in the city center as the most promising location in the future. According to the current land price in the city center, the highest price is in the areas around Zheng Tong Road, Guohe Road, the new stadium and park near the municipal government. This location is the best first-class residential area, and it is one of the smallest areas in the city. The price is as high as 6,000 yuan or so, and it is not easy to buy. It is now heard that the Real Estate Department of Xinhua Bank on Jiangxi Road is entrusted to sell real estate there.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Dear Sir, I read a news item in the "Local News" column of your newspaper on July 1, which stated that "Artificially dyed green jadeite was found in the Shanghai Jade Market". After investigation, it was found that it was not in accordance with the facts. The dyed emerald horse-eye was accidentally purchased by me. After it was identified, it was submitted to the market affairs council for inspection and confirmed to be true. According to industry regulations, the owner of the goods, Gu Yisheng, was fined as an example. Your newspaper mistakenly published that I was the owner of the goods, which is not in accordance with the facts. However, merchants value credibility the most, so I dare not remain silent, and I specially write this letter to ask you to correct it and clarify the truth. This is for the consideration of the editor. Respectfully, Wang Jinchang, July 5.</p>
<h3>Special Article Liu Haisu Reports on His European Tour (7)</h3>
<p>2.  This Promotion of Art Education Enhances China's International Status: Those with short-sighted views only hope that a good diplomat can use some magical means to enhance China's international status. This is just a dream! China is now a very poor nation, which Europeans know well. Europeans believe that China's situation is: the Communist Party is causing trouble, the economy is bankrupt, bandits are kidnapping people, the politics are dark, the culture is backward, and there are natural disasters such as floods and droughts! In addition to using economic aggression plans, they have looked down on China for a long time. Our so-called diplomats have no "status" internationally, so we can't blame them for not daring to speak. This is not a problem of people, but of a bad environment. To enhance China's international status, it is important to solve various problems, but it is even more urgent to promote the Chinese Renaissance movement. Because the development of modern European nations has always gone through great art and thought movements. The countries that are now called strong in the world are also the nations with developed modern cultures, such as France, Britain, Russia, Germany, and Italy. Before their national power was developed, there were always many great thinkers and artists who engaged in great thought and art movements with an indomitable spirit to inspire the public's independent and strong personality and independent and fearless development. Because great artists and thinkers are the soul of a nation. This can be proved by the fact that the exhibition of paintings in various countries has aroused the respect of people from various countries for the Chinese nation. The summary of the criticism published by the German "Future" newspaper on February 11, 1934, clearly represents the opinions of the most numerous audience: "...For the first time, without a catalog or explanation, I wandered through this beautiful forest of paintings for three hours without preparation, and I only felt dazed in a dream. There is such a higher and more excellent world in the universe, which is higher and purer than ours. It is like the ideal country of our great poets and artists 120 years ago. This intelligent nation is now being brutally bombed by some strong and armed countries. But it is still alive and existing very happily. I hope to go to China, accompany these people with supreme harmony and intelligence, learn everything from them, and tell people about their exquisite paintings... The second time I accompanied a country woman who, like me, had not studied or painted, but she also had sensibility and subtle feelings, and she had the same beautiful impression as I did. The third time I met a soldier who also collected all the new and old paintings, and he also hated and excluded outsiders like me, but here he also smiled, bowed his head, and accepted others sincerely. How can he bomb and destroy this cultural country? He repented and realized that such a transcendent and noble nation is inviolable..." Also, Dr. Kong William, a German art historian, said sincerely in his commentary published in the Berlin Daily: "...China is now not peaceful, and the great Central Plains has suffered setbacks. The philosophy that has been盛傳for thousands of years has been shattered, and Western science and industry are singing a triumphant song. But the soul of China is immortal, because painting is one of the greatest creations of the Chinese spirit. He has always preserved the characteristics he created and is evolving forward, and his deep roots provide nourishment to keep him alive forever. This is also a symbol of the Chinese nation..." Also, when the Chinese Modern Painting Exhibition was held in England, the British also had hundreds of criticisms. The editorial published by the Times on March 30, 1935, attracted international attention. Here is also an excerpt from it: (to be continued)</p>

<h3>Principal He Bingsong of Jida University Issues Statement: Detailed Account of Accepting the Appointment and Future Management Policies for Jida University</h3>
<p>—Shanghai Alumni Association Recommendation for Mr. He—</p>
<p>The position of president of National Jinan University has been filled by the central government's appointment of Mr. He Bingsong. Yesterday, our reporter made a special visit to Mr. He, who kindly issued the following statement:</p>
<p>Since returning to China after studying in the United States in the fifth year of the Republic [1916], I was introduced by Mr. Cai Yuanpei to Peking University and Beijing Higher Normal School, where I served as a lecturer in history for many years. It was not until the eleventh year of the Republic [1922] that, at the urging of Mr. Jiang Menglin and others, I went south to establish Zhejiang First Normal School and participate in the planning of Zhejiang University. At the time, I found it quite difficult to cope. Later, I was introduced by Mr. Wang Yunwu and Mr. Zhu Jingnong to the Commercial Press, where I worked as an editor and translator for more than ten years, which suited my personal interests. Therefore, in recent years, I have repeatedly declined invitations from Mr. Yang Duanda, Mr. Zhou Gengsheng, and Mr. Zhu Liuxian. This spring, I was honored to serve as the chairman of the China Academic Society, planning the affairs of the society, and I felt even more that my knowledge was insufficient.</p>
<p>Recently, Minister of Education Mr. Wang Xueting and various members of the board of directors believed that the position of president of Jinan University was of great importance and insisted that I take on the responsibility. I consistently declined due to my limited talent and learning, but they did not agree. At the same time, the Shanghai municipal party and government authorities also repeatedly urged me, making it impossible for me to refuse. Now that the official appointment has been announced, it concerns serving the country, and a national university is of great importance to national culture. Therefore, I cannot stubbornly decline and must comply. I will temporarily resign from the Commercial Press to devote myself to the duties of president.</p>
<p>As for the improvement of university affairs, I previously consulted the central government and have since given it detailed consideration. I deeply feel that there are many threads to unravel. For example, regarding curriculum issues, in addition to the need for fundamental reorganization and no longer creating courses based on individual instructors, how should we focus on cultivating teachers for Nanyang [Southeast Asia] and researching Nanyang commerce, in order to realize the special mission of Jinan University? Also, regarding financial issues, in addition to naturally ensuring absolute transparency, how should we plan for a reasonable allocation to ensure the balanced development of research work in all departments and colleges of the university? Furthermore, regarding the equipment of books and instruments, in addition to urgently enriching the essential parts, how should we strictly comply with regulations to effectively supplement them so that all teachers and students have abundant research materials? Moreover, regarding the overseas cultural affairs, which are greatly related to our country's future outward development, how should we plan various research methods, objects, and purposes to conduct them effectively, in order to contribute to the country? Furthermore, regarding the attached secondary school, where most students are children of overseas Chinese, how should we focus on modern national training to live up to the trust of their parents? All of these matters cannot be decided without gathering experts and deliberating at length. I am currently starting the research and will prepare a report within a set time, selecting the key points to be submitted to the ministry for approval and implementation.</p>
<p>As for whether an atmosphere of academic research can be created throughout the university and whether the academic performance of all students can be greatly improved, it all depends on whether the professors are suitable for their positions. Therefore, the issue of selecting professors for the entire university is of utmost importance. I have carefully considered this and prepared a list to be submitted to the ministry for approval. Once the instructions are received, formal invitations can be issued, and so on.</p>

(10) Regarding the request to allow overseas Chinese students graduating from the attached secondary school who have passed the entrance examination to enter the university department without further examination, he said he would consider it and then implement it, and so on.</p>
<h3>Children of This City: Return Gifts to American Children: 10,000 Items Collected by the Education Bureau; Reply Letters Printed and Ready to be Sent to the United States</h3>
<p>The American World Children's Friendship Association, in order to promote friendship among children worldwide, sent a large number of American drawings last year. The local Education Bureau distributed them to elementary school children in this city and collected return gifts, totaling 10,000 items, which are scheduled to be sent out by the end of this month. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Return Gifts: All 10,000 return gifts to American children have been collected by the local Education Bureau. They include the Children's Morning News Special Edition on the Construction of Greater Shanghai, which features copperplate-printed photos of construction in this city, as well as photos of Chinese scenery and handicrafts made by elementary school children, such as shuttlecocks, and portraits of Sun Yat-sen. Each item has 10,000 copies. Reply letters to American children, printed in both Chinese and English, have also been printed. The cover features the Chinese and American flags, and the back cover features a photo of Director Pan of the Education Bureau, the leader of the children of this city. The printing is exquisite, and the packaging of the various gifts is also quite elaborate.</p>
<p>Reply Letter to the United States: Dear American children, we received your large letter last year and many beautiful pictures, which allowed us to see the famous mountains and rivers of your country, inspiring our imagination. We are extremely grateful and delighted. Our Shanghai is mistakenly praised by various countries as the fourth largest commercial port in the world. Our dear American children must be thinking about it. Now, we will tell you about its general situation. Shanghai covers an area of 1,600 square li and has a population of over 3 million. It is located at the midpoint of our country's coastline, bordering the Yellow Sea to the east and connected to the Yangtze River, the Shanghai-Nanjing, and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways to the north. There are steamships going back and forth with major commercial ports around the world, making water and land transportation very convenient. In terms of scenery, there are Fanwang Pagoda Garden and Bansong Garden, which are very lush with trees. In terms of commercial areas, there are Nanshi, Zhabei, and the concessions. Since the success of our National Revolution, the government, considering that the commercial area is too far from the harbor (Wusong), making it inconvenient for merchant ships to enter and exit, began constructing the central district of Shanghai in the 20th year of the Republic [1931], realizing our ideal plan for Greater Shanghai. Now, the municipal government and its bureaus of health, public works, social affairs, education, and land have moved into the new buildings in the central district in the 23rd year of the Republic [1934] to conduct business. Residents' houses and roads have also been built one after another. There are also sports fields, libraries, schools, etc., which are also being actively constructed. In Wusongkou, wharves are being built to facilitate the loading and unloading of goods by merchant ships from various countries arriving at the port. The Nanjing Road area is the most prosperous for commercial business, followed by Zhabei, and then Nanshi. Shanghai has a population of over 3 million, and children account for three-tenths of the total. Among them, some have not yet entered school, because our country's elementary school system in the past did not implement a compulsory system like other countries around the world. However, it will gradually be improved in the future, so that every child in the country will attend school. As for the elementary school curriculum, in addition to the national language, arithmetic, history, geography, nature, hygiene, and civics, there are many extracurricular reading materials. Among them, the most popular is the Children's Morning News. This newspaper is half pictures and half literature, and its content is very rich. It strives to include any material that is beneficial to children. Reading it not only brings us endless fun, but also greatly benefits our studies. Therefore, almost every elementary school student in Shanghai already has a copy. The two newspapers we are sending you this time are the Children's Morning News. We have said too much. Are you annoyed? However, we have an ancestor, named Laozi, who had two famous sayings: "The rich give wealth, the benevolent give words." Therefore, we sincerely hope that you will not mind the distance and often communicate with us to guide us and report good news to us. We would be very grateful. Finally, we have prepared some gifts for you, which are listed on a separate list, so we won't say more here. As for the making and using of shuttlecocks, we have specially asked the Children's Morning News to publish a special issue to send to you, which you can understand at a glance. "A goose feather sent from afar is a small gift but full of affection." Please accept our sincerity. Goodbye, and wish you happiness. The children of Shanghai, Republic of China, bow.</p>

<h3>Municipal Wuben Girls' High School: New School Site Determined; Admissions on the 7th and 8th of This Month</h3>
<p>Municipal Wuben Girls' High School is the oldest girls' school in this city, having been established for 34 years. Recently, due to the old school buildings and small grounds, renovation was inconvenient, and expansion was impossible. Therefore, Principal Yan Zhenyu consulted the Education Bureau to plan a relocation and construction project. It is now known that it has been approved by the Municipal Government and the Municipal Education Bureau. A site of over fifty mu has been selected next to Zha Yin Road in the central district, with a construction cost of 350,000 yuan. Construction is scheduled to begin next semester, in preparation for moving into the new buildings during the winter vacation. In order to ensure that the construction and equipment of the new school buildings fully meet the ideals of modern girls' education, Principal Yan, along with the heads of various departments, visited famous high schools throughout the city this semester to learn from their experiences. It is also known that teachers, students, and alumni of the school will organize a committee to raise funds for a memorial hall to commemorate Wu Huaijiu, the founder of the school, at the site of the new buildings, to serve as a place for alumni gatherings and for teachers and students to improve their moral character and relax. It is expected that in half a year, the only municipal girls' high school in this city, beautiful and magnificent, will stand in the new urban area and become a model for girls' schools throughout the city.</p>
<p>In addition, it is reported that the first admissions of new students have been scheduled for registration on the 4th, 5th, and 6th of this month, with the examination starting on the 7th. As for transfer students for all grades, they will not be admitted because the quota is already full.</p>

After two years of study, he obtained a master's degree in economics. Mr. Jia has conducted particularly detailed research on tariff issues and has written a treatise with outstanding insights. He has now returned home after completing his studies and is scheduled to arrive at the North Bund Pier of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company at 3:00 PM today aboard the Conte Rosso.

<p>Zhaohe Middle School: Zhaohe Middle School in this city was founded in the 21st year of the Republic [1932]. Most of the founders are important figures in the central party and government. Yang Hu, director of the Security Bureau of this city, is particularly responsible in practice. The school was originally established to commemorate the Fourth Year of the Republic [1915] campaign against Yuan Shikai, in which Yang led the Zhaohe warship to launch an uprising, a glorious revolutionary history. The main purpose is to cultivate useful youth and provide them with practical and rigorous training to instill the knowledge of the new era. Therefore, the tuition fee is particularly lower than ordinary schools, equivalent to that of provincial middle schools. In the past two years, the number of students has increased significantly, and school affairs have progressed rapidly. Last semester, Mr. Yang resolutely accepted the election of the board of directors and became the headmaster. He has spared no effort in promoting school affairs in the past six months. As the original school address on Lubangsheng Road was located in a factory area, which affected the physical and mental development of students, a new school building and dormitory for boys and girls were specially leased and built at 990 Xujiahui Road. The construction is also underway. The teachers and staff hired next semester are mostly full-time and are graduates of famous universities at home and abroad. The new school site was originally the villa of a senior foreign military officer. The building is magnificent, and the location is secluded. It has now been fully moved into the new school site on July 3rd and is scheduled to recruit new students for the first time on July 15th.</p>

<h3>The Sino-Youth Tonight Aquatic Arts Performance - Six Public Programs, Eleven Performances</h3>
<p>The Sino-Youth Swimming Team will hold an aquatic arts performance tonight at 7:30 PM at the Sino-Youth Swimming Pool on Sichuan Road, with various public programs.

There will also be a water polo performance, which is rarely seen in Shanghai. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Tonight's Program</p>
<p>(1) 50-Yard Freestyle (Public), (2) Apple Swim, (3) Women's 50-Yard Freestyle (Public), (4) Three-Legged Swim, (5) 100-Yard Backstroke (Public), (6) Driving in Reverse, (7) 200-Yard Freestyle (Public), (8) Aquatic Tug-of-War, (9) Women's 100-Yard Breaststroke (Public), (10) Blindfolded Bell Robbery, (11) 100-Yard Breaststroke (Public), (12) Candle Swim, (13) Mixed Relay, (14) Fancy Diving, (15) Three-Style Relay (Married vs. Unmarried), (16) String of Firecrackers Wreaking Havoc in the Water Palace, (17) Water Polo (Married vs. Unmarried)</p>

<h3>Table Tennis Federation Prepares to Face Japan - Elects Seven Preparatory Committee Members - To Hold Inter-Port Championship</h3>
<p>The China National Table Tennis Federation sent the Chinese table tennis team to Japan to participate in the "Far East Table Tennis Tournament" during the Far East Games in 1930. Recently, with the National Games of our country scheduled to be held in Shanghai on October 10th, in case table tennis cannot be included in the championship at the National Games, the "National Table Tennis Inter-Port Championship" will still be held. In recent days, various ports have been sending letters inquiring and joining. The federation, considering this to be a matter of national importance, has been actively preparing. However, fearing that there would be too much work for too few people, it specifically convened a committee yesterday to elect Sun Shengzhang, Yu Bin, Zhang Yongren, Lu Zhongqiu, Lin Zecang, Shen Dingyi, and Lin Zemin as the "National Table Tennis Preparatory Committee" to emphasize their responsibilities. Any ports wishing to join or inquire can send letters to the "China National Table Tennis Joint Championship Preparatory Committee," No. 56, Nanjing Road, Shanghai (or send to Mr. Yu, No. 115, Hankou Road, for forwarding).</p>
<p>Recently, the National Table Tennis Federation has also received an invitation from the table tennis team of Rikkyo University in Japan (i.e., the so-called Tokyo Table Tennis Team) to come to Shanghai for a challenge. It is heard that the team departed from Japan in April this year to Dalian and then to Shanghai. The team has three major athletes, including Fujimura, who are the three most outstanding players in Japan. Other team members are also extremely fierce and can represent the "Japan National Table Tennis Team." The Chinese Table Tennis Federation, in view of this, has been preparing early to respond to the challenge. In recent years, the progress of table tennis in our country has been extremely rapid. In the Sino-Japanese competition, it is still unknown who will emerge victorious.</p>

<h3>Finance - The Bullish Front Wavering - The Gold Market Filled with Selling Pressure - Resulting in Another Fall of Ten Yuan and One Fen -</h3>
<p>The gold market suddenly experienced a period of fluctuations yesterday, mainly because the bullish sentiment wavered, and many floating orders were executed. Confidence waned, and prices nearly fell to the 820 yuan mark. However, due to continuous heavy buying by large players and a reduction in Indian silver imports, the market finally stabilized somewhat. Early in the morning, news came from overseas that the US market was completely closed. Only large gold bars in London remained flat for both near and far terms. Forward silver in Montreux rose by 2.5 to 3 percent. Exchange rates rose slightly. Spot gold in London fell by 7 pence. When pre-market trading opened, it immediately fell to 32.3 yuan, failing to maintain its position. Large players took the opportunity to sell bars, soon breaking the 30 yuan mark and retreating to 28 or 29 yuan. The Central Bank's announced prices were flat for both British and American currencies. The customs gold unit fell by 7 cents. The listed standard price for gold was 863.2 yuan. Afterwards, supply and demand from large players were inconsistent, and there was much struggle. The morning opened with low prices, and the market continued to weaken after the opening. However, buyers maintained support at low prices, resulting in some rebound. The exchange rate announced by HSBC was flat for both British and American currencies, and the market hovered without direction. In any case, banks' appetite remained full, and the foreign exchange market hardened. Sellers continuously moved, gradually pushing prices lower. The Hong Kong market also loosened accordingly. Confidence was strangely timid, and bullish positions continued to be unloaded. There were also some short-selling flows, resulting in extremely strong selling pressure and a rapid decline. Later, banks took advantage of the cheap prices to buy back in, and large players vigorously purchased at low prices, resulting in some rebound. However, confidence had not yet stabilized, and the trend at noon remained weak. The market immediately trended downward after the afternoon opening. However, in general, large players continued to buy heavily, leading to a prolonged struggle. Unexpectedly, the Indian silver report showed a small reduction of one anna, causing sellers to feel disappointed and being pulled up. Although there was some oscillation, the banks' appetite was strong, and buyers repeatedly moved, while short-sellers took the opportunity to enter, resulting in a rebound. The source of supply was still abundant even after the rise, leading to a slight pullback. However, confidence had stabilized. The Indian silver price remained unchanged for the second time, and the final situation was peaceful. The market was extremely weak throughout the day, and the spot market was the same. The swap spread was 2.5 yuan in favor of the bullish side. Below is a record of the market situation for the day.</p>

<p>The afternoon opened at 822.7 yuan, then gradually declined from 2.9 yuan. Dadesheng, Wanfeng, Hengyu, Yifeng, Yongtong, and Yurun sold, retreating to 1 yuan. Fuxingyong, Qingfayong, Manheng made strenuous efforts to maintain support and struggled greatly. After entering, the Indian silver price unexpectedly decreased by one anna, causing Hengyu, Fuxingyong, and Yingxiang to scramble to purchase, immediately rising to 3.8 yuan. Hengyu, Yingxiang, Dadesheng, and Fuxingyong took advantage of the high prices to supply gold bars, retreating to 2.5 yuan. Fuxingyong, Futaiyong, Huixiang, Futuo, Richang, Yuanmao, Yongqian, and Yuanyong and others competed to purchase, rising further to 6 yuan. Fuyu, Yiyu, Hongxing, Hengchangyong took advantage of the high prices to sell gold bars, falling to 4.7 yuan. However, Shenfeng and Fuxingyong still advanced, rising to 6 yuan.

As a result, it fell by 10 yuan and 1 fen compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price, based on the Central Bank's listed standard price for gold, decreased to 863.2 yuan. Based on the closing price, it was approximately 38 yuan less, which was about 6 yuan more than the previous close. The recorded prices for this month were 823 yuan for August and 823 yuan for this morning. The water supplement prices were 823 yuan in the morning and 825 yuan in the afternoon. The price of pure gold was increased by 10 yuan to 838.8 yuan. The spot market was still weak, and the swap spreads were unfavorable to the bullish side. Buyers were even more on the sidelines, and the supply side was even more eager. The price for Tianjin goods was increased by 13 yuan and 7.5 cents, sold by Yingfenghheng to the Tianjin gang for 350 taels. The price for cast gold was only increased by 15.5 yuan, sold by Taikangkangrun to the silver shop gang for over 100 taels. The swap traders were even more timid, and there was a lack of short-sellers, so the discount was even higher. A large bullish trader named Yuanyi offered 105 gold bars to Shengyida at a discount of 2.5 yuan, due to Yuanyi's eagerness to short sell, releasing spot goods and recovering cash. There were 630 gold bars remaining in this month's notes, excluding public notes. There were a total of 15 bullish traders and 1 short seller.</p>

However, the demand from banks was higher than the supply, and the final trend was slightly tighter.

<h3>Call Money Shows Slight Easing</h3>
<p>Interest rates remain unchanged: Copper coins increase by another 1,000.</p>
<p>Yesterday's silver dollar market situation: The government's relief loans have been actually distributed. However, only a few have benefited slightly due to collateral issues. Ultimately, this sudden increase in a large amount of funds in the market has somewhat supplemented the current financial situation. Therefore, the situation has gradually eased, and the long-unchanging call money rate has gradually declined, showing slight easing. The opening immediately fell by one dime, changing to five dimes, and finally closed at four dimes and five cents, a decrease of one dime and five cents compared to the previous market. However, the silver dollar aspect remained stable. Both the morning and afternoon markets remained at one dime, the same as before. In the call loan transaction market, over 2.4 million was transferred in the morning, with over 500,000 in new transactions. In the afternoon market, there were over 200,000 in transactions. There were over 800,000 in transactions among small general associations. Silver dollar pledged transactions involved redemption of over 600,000 and new issues of over 700,000.

<h3>Securities - The Bond Market Is in a Period of Oscillation and Brewing</h3>
<p>Retail investors show some supply - A drop of around angles.</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, due to the tug-of-war between the bullish and bearish sides, the trend entered a period of oscillation. The market was dull throughout the day, and prices oscillated between angles. In terms of inflows and outflows, there were more retail investors offering for sale, perhaps due to some timidity under the constraints of the changing environment of heavy silver funds. The future trend may still need to go through a considerable period of brewing. Yesterday, the morning opening saw quite a bit of supply from retail investors, affecting the various bonds with a drop of between stone angles and three angles. The pace of the second session was unable to be consistent, and price fluctuations completely followed the supply and demand of chips. The afternoon opening was still chaotic, with one rising and the other falling, to the extreme degree of confusion. The closing was mostly lower due to the settlement of some groups. In summary, the result of the price throughout the day was that, with the exception of Jiusheng, which rose slightly by 5 cents, the rest all uniformly fell by about half a yuan. The volume of transactions totaled 8.1 million yuan. The high and low results are listed in the comparative table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton - Japanese Merchants Purchase Large Quantities of Cotton</h3>
<p>The cotton market continues to be firm, and the trend for July and August deliveries is becoming increasingly strong. Because the bullish pull is quite strong, rumors of short squeezes are extremely intense. General floating short positions are actively covering, so the near term is uniquely firm. After noon, it was heard that the price of gold fell back, and the market showed a slight easing. However, the current demand for cotton from Japanese factories is great.</p>
<p>The near-month market state is more lively.</p>
<p>The opening of the cotton tender market saw a rather tight near-month situation, with the bullish side holding on tightly, keeping the prices high. It was reported that cotton fields in Shandong Province suffered from drought, and most fields were unable to sow, resulting in great losses. However, there was another piece of news that the cotton production situation in Shaanxi was good, and recently the rainfall has been well-distributed, so production is good. As a result, people's hearts were normal. The result was that each month's price rose by 5 cents to 1 dime compared to the previous day's close. After the afternoon opening, the trend for July and August deliveries was particularly strong. A peak was found in the second session, but when bidding closed, some of the bullish traders exited, and prices fell back by 1 dime. The result was that the July delivery price was the same as the morning closing price, and the long-term price fell by 1 dime and 5 cents. It was found that Gengfeng sold 4,800 bales, Dafu 1,100 bales, Taixing 1,200 bales, Junchang 2,800 bales, Yicheng 2,300 bales, Changfeng 1,000 bales, Runkang 2,000 bales, and Changhe 1,400 bales. Hexing bought 1,500 bales, Dafu 1,500 bales, Shenji 1,200 bales, Runkang 1,100 bales, Xincheng 5,900 bales, Changhe 1,700 bales, Junchang 1,400 bales, Shengyuan 1,300 bales, Yikang 2,700 bales, and Yuanxingchang 1,600 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Raw cotton trading is unusually smooth.</p>
<p>Spot cotton transactions are gradually developing, and the need for Japanese factories is greatly active. Furthermore, the factories' purchase of currency continues uninterrupted. A total of 2,413 pieces were traded. The source of goods was 700 bales of Yaohua cotton.</p>
<h3>Most Bullish Positions in This Month's Yarn Concluded</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to be weak, with a complicated situation and people's hearts unable to be determined. However, the majority of psychological opinions are still bearish on the market price, because Japanese yarn is circulating in all directions and the selling price is cheaper. The trading of Chinese yarn may be affected. However, in recent times, the sales of existing yarn have become increasingly developed, and the purchase of goods along the North China route has been improving daily.</p>
<p>Gold is Weak Again</p>
<p>The pre-market opening of the yarn tender market saw all months presenting a flat and stable appearance. However, when bidding reached the second or third round, it was heard that the trading of existing yarn was less than before and that selling prices were unchanged. The popularity was calm. The result was that each contract month slightly fell by 1 to 4 angles compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening saw a sudden fall in the situation because the price of gold fell back, and Changfeng came to throw out goods again. When bidding reached the second or third round, the bullish traders concluded their positions for this month. The price for longer-term contracts took a hit, but new sellers were not eager because there were still over 2,000 bales of Japanese yarn involved in the transactions between existing yarn customers and Japanese gangs. As a result, the near-term contract fell by 6 to 4 angles compared to the morning closing price, and the long-term contract fell by 2 to 3 angles. It was found that Dafu sold 1,100 bales, Mingde 300 bales, Hexing 300 bales, Junchang 900 bales, Taichang 400 bales, and Changfeng 1,600 bales, and Dachang 450 bales. Yida bought 400 bales, Changyu 300 bales, Hengde 500 bales, Yichang 400 bales, Xiesheng 600 bales, Hexing 300 bales, and Taixing 400 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>The Yarn Route Is Strong with 1,000 Bales</p>
<p>The sales field for existing yarn is still good. It was found that the total number of bales bought by all gangs throughout the day was 1,026 bales. The market was similar to the previous day. However, the 10-count yarn was particularly popular. Over 1,000 bales of Japanese yarn were traded, and the market was slightly uneven. The purchase amount for each gang is as follows:</p>
<p>Tianjin 585, Weihaiwei 60, Inland 55, Shantou 5</p>
<p>Guangdong 20, Wuhu 20, Xuzhou 30, Xiamen 10</p>
<p>Changsha 150, Nanjing 1</p>
<h3>American Cotton Market Closed, British and Indian Markets Rise Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was closed due to the Independence Day holiday. Spot British cotton rose by 2 points, and futures rose by 1 to 2 points. The Indian cotton market initially weakened due to bullish traders taking profits and European exporters selling, but later rose due to futures traders and Japanese merchants buying. The counts</p>
<p>for the flat goods rose by one rupee, the Amra rose by 0.5 to 1.5 rupees, and the Bai Luo Creek rose by 0.75 to 2.5 rupees. The original telegram record is on the left (4th telegram).</p>
<h3>Large Sales of Hua Bei Cotton Yarn in the Past Five Days</h3>
<p>Estimated at 10,000 Bales of Japanese Yarn: 6,000-7,000 Bales of Chinese Yarn</p>
<p>Since the news of the resumption of standard auctions for Japanese yarn, North China has been actively seeking and purchasing Japanese yarn from Monday to today. According to surveys, the total volume is estimated at around 10,000 bales. Other groups purchased less, causing the price of cotton yarn to soar by 3-4 yuan. The price of 32-count and 42-count thread increased by 5-6 yuan. The sales of Chinese yarn have also increased compared to before, with approximately 6,000-7,000 bales sold. The Tianjin group only purchased blended yarn. Based on the above situation, it is speculated that yarn inventories may decrease. Recent surveys show that the total inventory of Chinese and foreign yarn is over 65,000 pieces.</p>
<h3>Food Grains: Flour and Wheat Cannot Withstand the Impact of Foreign Wheat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market was extremely volatile again. Trading in all months was brisk, with price drops reaching 24 cents. The quoted price for foreign wheat was unavailable for Chicago wheat and dropped by 45 cents for Canadian wheat. It was also reported that the factory had traded two ships of Australian wheat the day before yesterday at a price as low as 4.49 yuan, or rumored to be 4.47 yuan. Furthermore, European wheat prices also fell sharply. Due to these various reasons, selling pressure was high, but there were floating short coverings and factory offerings, resulting in a trading volume of over 600,000 bags in half a day. At the opening in the afternoon, sentiment became even more pessimistic due to rumors that the fixed price of foreign wheat would be further reduced, with a quotation of only 4.40 yuan. Although it could not be confirmed whether this would be the final price, the selling pressure naturally intensified with this quotation. Even the large factories were lowering their prices step by step, causing futures prices to fall another 2 cents. With little new domestic wheat entering the market and foreign wheat being dumped, it will be difficult to stimulate the market in the future. As a result, this month's price fell by 2 cents compared to the previous day, August fell by 2.75 cents, September fell by 3.25 cents, October fell by 3.75 cents, November fell by 4 cents, and December fell by 4.25 cents.</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market opened lower across all months in both the morning and afternoon. The quoted price for foreign wheat showed a drop of 45 cents for Canadian wheat and a significant drop of 1.35 yuan for Liverpool wheat. With such a consistent drop in quoted prices, the combined price of foreign wheat is becoming cheaper and cheaper. Based on this, it seems that the surplus of foreign wheat has not decreased from before, and dumping in our country is inevitable. As a result, market sentiment is uneasy, and the market is declining again. Amidst the domestic water and drought disasters, this situation is truly unexpected. As a result, this month's price fell by 3 cents, August fell by 6 cents, and September and October fell by 7 cents. The current state of wheat is that there is still no trading in rail wheat, and there is slight trading in ship wheat, with prices lower by 1-2 cents, mostly sent to factories, so there are few formal auctions.</p>
<p>Canadian Wheat July 3 July 4 Change</p>
<p>August 82.50 8.25 Down 1.25</p>
<h3>He Xia Rice Rebounded Yesterday - A Sudden Surge in Foreign Rice Transactions by the Yangtze River Gang</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the total supply of local rice (Shanghai South) from various groups was 16 shipments, including Su Tong Group No. 4, Nan Gang No. 8, Qing Jiao Song Si No. 4 (totaling over 3,000 stones). Due to the cloudy weather, market sentiment stabilized slightly, and there was some activity in the local market, leading to a more stable situation. The market appeared to be tightening. As a result, the price of Su Tong Japonica rice rebounded by several cents to about a dime. However, Nan Gang early rice was said to have a larger supply, and Bo Dao rice sales were suspended, resulting in only a stable situation. Looking at the future, if it rains, there is hope for a rebound. Other varieties like Yin Xiang Yuan also remained unchanged. Yang Jian rice, due to a long-term shortage, saw fresh activity upon its arrival in the market yesterday. (Shanghai North) Supply was around 10 shipments. The inventory of river rice was scarce. The local market for white japonica rice was sluggish for high-quality rice after deglutination, but medium and low-quality rice became fresher, with high-quality rice holding steady in price and medium and low-quality rice tightening by several cents to a dime. There was still a supply of white yuan rice, but sales were small, and the market price dropped slightly by a dime or two. Bo Dao rice was scarce and selling well, and the market price remained stable.</p>
<p>The foreign rice market was stable yesterday. Although sales to inland groups were suspended, there was a sudden surge in transactions by the Yangtze River Gang. Various groups from Jiujiang and Hankou were actively purchasing, and sales to Nanjing were also good. This was due to the floods in the Yangtze River region, which prompted purchases in the local market. There were also continued sales in the local market. A total of over 10,000 bags were traded throughout the day, including 7,000 bags of Saigon rice, 2,500 bags of Xiaojiao rice, and over 1,000 bags of Gao Gong broken rice, Siamese rice, Su Geng Di rice, etc. As a result, the market price remained stable. For Ke Xian rice, 200 bags of Wenzhou machine rice were purchased and sent inland.</p>
<h3>An Dong Bean Cake Market Softens - The Rising Trend of Local Bean Cake Has Been Halted</h3>

<p>Yesterday, green tea sales remained brisk. Lu Zhuang County's Zhen Mei green tea was purchased by Xie He Tong Fu and other firms, opening at 64-65 yuan, a rise of 3-4 yuan from before. Zhen Mei from Tun Xi Yuan and other areas arrived in small quantities in recent days, and the market inventory was very low, resulting in no large transactions. However, sales of Zhen Mei, Xiu Mei, and Pearl Tea from French plantations were active, and there was also a high demand for low-grade Gong Xi and Bai Tou Zhuang teas.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Domestic Cotton Red Label Rebounds</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was weakened by the drop in customs gold. The Chamber of Commerce quoted 16 yuan for spot No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar and about 4.80 yuan for re-exported goods, but no transactions occurred. The quoted prices for Taikoo sugar and the factory's cotton white sugar remained the same, and there was also a lack of activity. However, since the price increase of domestic cotton red label sugar, sales have been active. In the past two days, Chao Bang firms sold a total of 600 bags, with those of excellent quality opening at 11.60 yuan, followed by prices ranging from 11.23 yuan to 11 yuan. The market rebounded, and prices also rose slightly.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: To Unify Market Prices, the North Goods Industry Organizes Jin Cai Company</h3>
<p>Since the arrival of new day lily, goods from Xuzhou, Qingjiang, Zhongxing, and other places have arrived one after another, and Fujian and Guangdong groups have been purchasing them. According to a long-distance telephone call from Zhenjiang yesterday, the first batch of new Yang Hua vegetables has also arrived in Zhen, and the Shanghai market is currently receiving and purchasing them and will transport them to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that the Shanghai North Goods industry, in view of the past competition, which resulted in very little profit, has specially organized a public limited company to raise funds for the launch of the new golden day lily, unifying market prices to achieve the effect of cooperation. It was established yesterday and can be consistent in terms of imports and exports. It will be piloted for one month, and if successful, it will continue. However, it is limited to the golden day lily and does not involve other goods.</p>
<h3>Metals: The Stalemate in Spot Tin Remains Difficult to Break</h3>
<p>The spot tin market has recently been affected by the unfavorable environment, and various groups are watching and not purchasing. However, goods are frequently being shipped in. Customers who sell and the tin foil shops in Shaoxing are affected by tight credit and the collapse of rural areas and have stopped purchasing. As a result, there are very few transactions. The standard is loose, with No. 1 Dutch tin estimated at 160 yuan per dan, No. 2 at 150 yuan, Gua Hong tin opening at 148.50 yuan, Fan Tiao tin estimated at 140 yuan, Fu Zu tin opening at 159 yuan, and Dou tin estimated at 148 yuan, all lower than the previous market by 1-2 yuan. However, colleagues have recently been eager to sell, but buyers are staying still, so the trend is unusually quiet. Unless there are large-scale transactions, the market price may continue to decline.</p>
<h3>Narrow Strip Tinplate Street Sales Are Particularly Strong</h3>
<p>The narrow strip tinplate market has been quiet recently for out-of-town buyers, but the local street business has been unusually active. The factories are purchasing more narrow strip iron to replace tinplate due to the high prices. Narrow strip iron is cheaper and of good quality. According to yesterday's market, over 200 boxes were traded, with American goods selling for 20.05 yuan per box, British goods selling for 19.75 yuan, and French goods opening at 18.50 yuan. It is reported that they were sold by hardware stores along North Suzhou Road.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Xu Xiaoting)</p>
<p>The slight drizzle does not necessarily seep into the house, and the complex and diverse society does not necessarily corrupt young people. To prevent rain from entering the house, it is necessary to repair the leaks. To prevent young people from falling, it is necessary to instill appropriate knowledge.</p>
<p>Opposing chastity is the characteristic of romantic women, and opposing reading is the characteristic of degenerate youths. In fact, women who seek a life within the confines of chastity may sometimes be unchaste. Young people who seek knowledge in a reading environment may sometimes not seek knowledge. It depends on human effort. Circumstances make heroes, and the environment can sometimes change one's nature.</p>
<p>Although economic subsidies are necessary to help the countryside, attention must be paid to seed improvement and fertilizer research. Thinking from one aspect is dead, while thinking from multiple aspects is alive.</p>
<h3>Women and Beauty</h3>
<p>— Zhang Huang</p>
<p>As long as a woman is in her youth, she is beautiful for several years, but most of them are unaware of it.</p>
<p>Among women, if someone is truly very beautiful, or very lively, or truly very dashing, they will definitely be aware of it!</p>
<p>Women can discover beauty in the same sex better and faster than men. They can admire the beauty of the same sex with sincerity, without a trace of jealousy, unless there is a special reason.</p>
<p>Naturally, they most want to have beauty themselves and do their best to achieve "having all the beauty, without any lack of beauty." The so-called "daughters love themselves naturally" does not necessarily have any purpose, such as the "women dress for the pleasure of men" mentality. Therefore, they are often afraid that youth will fade away. Each woman probably does not hesitate to increase the consumption of cosmetics with age, even if she is still in her youth, in her radiant period. If someone teases her and says, "I haven't seen you for a few days, and you seem to have lost weight! Relax a little, it's not worth making yourself look so tired!" She will definitely believe this person's words and become suspicious of herself. Also, if someone compliments an old woman in her thirties or forties and says, "Why are you always so young! If you pay a little more attention to dressing up, wouldn't you still be in your wonderful teenage years?" I know that although she usually laments and hates the gradual aging of her appearance, she will thank this person for correcting her long-held hypersensitive misconception, making her suddenly wake up. You know how much inexplicable joy is added to her heart at this time, and at the same time, she praises this person as the only one who understands, even if she is humbly on the surface: "Oh, we are old women!" Ah!</p>
<p>In fact, the relationship between women and beauty is much greater than that of men. But look, the voices of women transmitted on the phone or on the radio are mostly delicate; the figures of women walking on the street are mostly charming. If you don't meet them face-to-face, you won't want to turn around and take a look. This special gift is the lifeline of women!</p>
<p>I sympathize with the special beauty of women here and wish that all the girls in the world will become angels, amen!</p>

<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Fifteen: Bitterly Persuading with Sincere Words, Not Just Empty拍案, The Sound of Money and Shadows of Lamps Pitifully Sells People</p>
<p>Zhiqian thought to himself that there were probably countless similar things happening in the Tu Hai Hotel, so why bother worrying about this one? So he pulled a book out of the net basket and put it under the lamp to read. He had only read two lines when he said to himself that it wouldn't work and loudly called for the tea attendant. The tea attendant brought in a kettle of boiling water and asked if he wanted boiling water. Zhiqian said: I don't want boiling water, I want to ask you something. In Mr. Zhang's room, many people were gathered just now, and there was the sound of foreign money, what were they doing? The tea attendant smiled and did not answer. Zhiqian said: It seems that Miss Zhu has already been sold to that man named Jia, right? The tea attendant laughed and said: It's not really selling! It's just giving a gift of fifty dollars and taking the person over. If it were a sale, Mr. Jia could pay more money. Because the Zhu family just didn't want to sever ties, Mr. Jia said that there would definitely be a lot of burden in the future, so he didn't add money. However, he still had to spend a sum, so it was agreed that tonight, the money would be handed over and the person would be handed over at the same time. Mr. Jia has plenty of money, he just treats this little bit of money as if he had spent it on prostitution and doesn't care about it. Zhiqian said: The person will be sent over tonight, why so fast? The tea attendant said: They have already handed over the money, if the person is not sent over, how can he agree? He paid the money so happily, isn't it all for the sake of... The tea attendant saw that Zhiqian's expression was not good and left on his own. Zhiqian, on the other hand, clearly felt that this matter had nothing to do with him, but he felt very uncomfortable in his heart, as if he were drunk. He couldn't read the book, and he couldn't sleep, so he just sat under the lamp feeling depressed. After about an hour, he heard someone knocking on the back door of Little Western Paradise from afar. Following that, the tea attendant in the courtyard walked to the back door. (258)</p>
<h3>Records of Floating Imperial Fragrance</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The prescriptions that the four imperial physicians prescribed to the Empress Dowager generally had twelve kinds of medicinal herbs, about half of which were the same, and half of which were different; in total, there were more than twenty kinds. The Empress Dowager looked at their prescriptions one by one, and as she looked, she asked the old eunuch about the properties of the various herbs—there were also a few that she herself had always known, so there was no need to ask again; there were also a few that she knew, but was not sure of, or had forgotten, so she had to ask the old eunuch. In this way, she selected what suited her best and wrote it down. When she had picked out twelve, she would no longer pick any more. So the writing eunuch used another piece of white paper and respectfully wrote down the twelve herbs that her old self had picked out. In this way, the fifth prescription was created. This fifth prescription combined the strengths (?) of the original four prescriptions and was a collection of them. One, two, or three or four herbs from the original four prescriptions were used in it, so it could also be said to be a mixed prescription; but the Empress Dowager did not pay attention to whether the properties of these herbs, which were not originally on the same prescription, were compatible or conflicting, nor did she let the four imperial physicians take them away to study them. However, if this mixed prescription caused any problems, the four imperial physicians could not escape responsibility. No wonder I was almost so surprised that I cried out when I watched from the side.</p>
<p>"Now that the prescription has been written," the Empress Dowager looked at me and said, "Deling, you should go this time! When those four stupid medical officers are preparing the medicine for me, you must carefully supervise them!" (358)</p>
<h3>Newspaper Seller A Wu</h3>
<p>— Bai Ding</p>
<p>Every day, when the sun just climbed up the east mountain, not long after, A Wu, who lived by selling newspapers, would get up hurriedly from the bed made of only three planks, put on a tattered shirt with seven holes and eight patches, and without even washing his face, he would hurriedly cross his tired feet and set off towards the general assembly point for newspaper sellers - Wangping Street. Every day, he rigidly practiced this, no matter how bad the weather, whether it rained, snowed, or was a big wind, there was no need to say, he would go out in the wind and rain as usual. He understood that this was for living, for eating, if he didn't do this, he would have no food to eat, and no life.</p>
<p>Years of hard work had worn A Wu into a consumptive ghost: his two eyeballs were deeply sunken in their sockets, his face was as pale as if there was no blood in it, his cheekbones were high, his dry lips, and his gaunt chin suddenly made him look like a monkey.</p>
<p>So, his companions gave him the nickname: "Monkey A Wu."</p>
<p>The bell had only rung six times, and ninety-nine percent of the people were still sweetly sleeping in dreamland. However, A Wu had already distributed the newspapers he had just picked up from Wangping Street to each household like a revolving lantern.</p>
<p>A Wu is a hardworking person. In addition to delivering newspapers for people in the morning, he had nothing to do in the evening, so he had to sell some evening newspapers, shouting and selling like flying in the streets and alleys, of course, that was also regardless of wind and rain.</p>
<p>According to what he told me, even with such frugality and diligence, his family could not get enough to eat, because in addition to himself, he also had a father in his sixties, a wife, and two children?</p>
<p>Pitifully, a few days ago, he had a fever all over his body from being hit by the wind and rain. He really couldn't support himself to deliver newspapers, so, these days, the one delivering newspapers was his fifteen-year-old child who was both small and weak!</p>
<p>Small Gardening</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Notes on Yumberry</h3>
<p>— Red Sheep</p>
<p>Yumberry is also a kind of fine fruit in midsummer, with a purple color and plum flavor. It is shaped like a small spiny chestnut, without skin and with a pit. It is on the market after the Dragon Boat Festival. The best yumberry is as big as a walnut, with a color like a purple ribbon, juicy and coreless, with a sweet and clean taste, without the drawbacks of sourness and astringency. Among the fruits, it can be called a delicious one.</p>
<p>There are many places that produce yumberry. The ones produced in Dongting Mountain in Taihu Lake, Suzhou, are as famous as Zisha loquats. There are also many products in Lanxi, Zhejiang, and other places, and the quality is no less than that of Dongting. There is also a kind of white yumberry, which is slightly smaller and flatter than the purple one, with a pit as small as a soybean. The sweetness is like honey, which is even better than the purple one, but the production is not large. Except for the local people, who can taste it, it is rarely seen elsewhere and cannot have this kind of deliciousness.</p>
<p>The usual way to eat yumberry is to first wash the yumberry with cold boiled water or sand-filtered water, and then add a little salt flower to melt on the top of the yumberry. This can kill the insects that parasitize on the yumberry. This is also because the yumberry has no skin, and insects are easy to parasitize on the vegetables. Salt has the effect of disinfecting and killing insects, so there is this way of eating. In addition to the yumberry sold on the market now, there is also a kind that is chilled with ice. When eating, it feels even more fragrant and refreshing. But this way of eating ice-chilled yumberry did not start today. It already existed in the past. Wu Kuan's yumberry poem has the line "If you want to know how cold and good it is, a thousand pieces are recommended on an ice plate", which is ironclad proof of ice-chilled yumberry.</p>
<p>There are many good stories about yumberry. During the Three Kingdoms period, "When Yang Xiu was nine years old, Kong Rong pointed to the yumberry set up by his father and showed Xiu said, 'This is the fruit of your family,' and Xiu responded and said; 'I have not heard that the peacock is a bird of the master.'" During the Liang Dynasty, "Ren Fang was the prefect of Xin'an, and the county had the honey ridge that produced yumberry. It was formerly collected by the prefect, and Fang stopped it immediately because the collection was very dangerous and there were many poisonous things." During the Qi Dynasty, "The yumberry in Wang Xuzhi's courtyard had three fruits in the middle of winter, which people said was caused by filial piety." These are all good stories of the time.</p>
<p>There are also many other names for yumberry, such as Lizhu. "Lu You's poem, 'I don't love the full ship, only the fire, I was surprised to find Lizhu.'" Heting, "Xu Jie's poem, 'I broke off the red Heting, and dug out the dragon's eyes before the blood was dry.'" Saint Monk, "Qian Que Lei Shu records that Yangzhou people call white yumberry Saint Monk." Red fruit, "Guo Zhengxiang's yumberry poem, 'Red fruit decorated with green branches, shining on the front house.'" Jindan, "Bing Ke's poem, 'Looking at the big tree in the cloud pond, trying Jindan in the Xia room.'" Maru Tan, "Xu Jie's poem, 'The green pill is small under the leaves in March, and the Maru Tan is round on the branches in May.'" Sui Zhu, "Li Dongyang's poem, 'The name is from the transmission, and the price is more expensive than Sui Zhu.'" These are all famous other names for yumberry.</p>
<p>According to "Xi Hu Ting Shi", Yangmei Wu in Hangzhou is located in Rui Feng Shi Wu near Nanshan. There is an old woman surnamed Jin, whose family's yumberry is very prosperous, commonly known as Yangmei Wu, the so-called Jin Po Yumberry. It can be seen that Hangzhou also produces yumberry, and it is named after people. Naturally, it is a good kind of yumberry, but now, there is no longer any name of Jin Po Yumberry, and even the place name of Yangmei Wu in Hangzhou does not exist. This is really the vicissitudes of the yumberry producing area.</p>
<p>"Gui Er Ji" states that the Min scholar went to the imperial examination, and the Wu scholar went to the adjustment, each boasting about their native products. The Min said lychee, and the Wu said yumberry. There is a topic on the wall that says, "The jade girl in Min Township contains ice and snow, and the star king in Wu County drives a big cloud." From this record, the yumberry in Wu County can be compared with lychee, and it has long been famous throughout the country, and it is not from today.</p>

<h3>Radio Waves Under the Direction of Quantum Theory</h3>
<p>— Hao</p>
<p>Before the invention of quantum theory, the most powerful theory to explain electromagnetic waves was the wave theory. Since Einstein invented the theory of relativity, quantum theory has established a solid foundation based on it and overturned part of the wave theory. So, how does quantum theory explain electromagnetic waves?</p>
<p>It says: "We know that all matter in the world is composed of atoms, and an atom consists of a nucleus and several electrons surrounding it. Electrons orbit the nucleus at a speed of 2,200 kilometers per second. Since the speed is so high, its centrifugal force must also be very large. But why doesn't it fly out? It is because of the attraction between the free protons and free electrons in the nucleus. The magnitude of the attraction is related to the distance. Therefore, when an electron moves from an outer orbit to an inner orbit, or from an inner orbit to an outer orbit, it must release or absorb considerable energy. Since electrons are the smallest unit of all matter in the world, then the ability to absorb or release energy is naturally the smallest unit of energy, called a quantum. These emitted quanta are emitted in all directions at a speed of 300,000 kilometers per second. The number of groups of quanta emitted per second is the frequency of this electromagnetic radiation. The distance between two adjacent groups of quanta is the wavelength of this electromagnetic radiation. If the frequency is between 60,000 and 1,500 kilocycles, it is a shortwave radio wave; at 1,500 to 600 kilocycles, it is a broadcast radio wave."</p>
<p>The above is just a brief explanation. If you want to study it in detail, please refer to books specializing in quantum theory. Due to space limitations, it can only be omitted here.</p>
<h3>Piezoelectric Headphone</h3>
<p>— Pao</p>
<p>When a substance with piezoelectric effect is subjected to pressure or tension, a voltage is generated on its surface; conversely, if a voltage is applied, its physical state changes. Utilizing this feature, if a voltage that has been modulated with music is applied to a piece of material with piezoelectric effect, a corresponding change in physical state will occur. If this change in physical state can be used to agitate air by means of a mechanical structure, the original music sound can be obtained. A piezoelectric headphone is made based on this principle, and its structure is completely different from that of an ordinary magnet headphone.</p>
<p>The piezoelectric headphone is produced by The Brush Development Co. in the United States, and its appearance is as shown in Figure A. The material with piezoelectric effect used in it is Rochelle Salt Crystal (sodium potassium tartrate), measuring five-eighths of an inch square and 0.01 inches thick. The entire headphone weighs only six ounces.</p>
<p>The sensitivity of this type of headphone is extraordinarily high, with a impedance of 50,000 ohms at 1,000 cycles; its working frequency range can be from 60 cycles to 10,000 cycles. When connected to a radio, the connection method is different from that of ordinary headphones, as shown in detail in Figure B. The choke coil or resistor in the diagram is used as the plate load for the final vacuum tube.</p>
<h3>German Television</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>While American television has not yet been realized, television broadcasting has already begun in England and Germany with the help of the government. Other European countries are imitating them, and it can be said that Europeans are experiencing an intense television craze.</p>
<p>In Berlin, two ten-inch diameter copper rings have appeared in the sky at a height of four hundred and fifty feet. Since then, television has become a popular term rather than a specialized one. These two copper rings are the antennas of the "Berlin Television Broadcasting Station." The ultra-short waves with fifteen kilowatts of power are broadcast from this unique antenna, which can reach an area of about fifty miles around. Each television broadcasting station has two broadcasting machines, one is an ordinary sound transmitter, and the other is a video transmitter. Radio receivers or television viewers also use a special receiver to receive the signals. The screens of these receivers are of two sizes: four inches high and six inches wide, or ten inches high and twelve inches wide.</p>
<p>The adjustment of television channels is very easy because there is a seven-meter space between the wavelengths of the two television stations. This means that there are very few stations in this band. The selectivity of the receiver is not a problem, and there is no interference even if two television stations broadcast at the same time.</p>
<p>The "Berlin Television Broadcasting Station" has been broadcasting on a wavelength of seven meters for nine months. The images displayed are black and white, but they usually have a slight blue or green tint. If television stations all use the "180-line manner" like the "Berlin Broadcasting Station," then not only the head but also the movements of the whole body can be displayed.</p>
<p>The price of each video transmitter is from 250 to 500 US dollars. Television receivers can be divided into two parts, one for receiving sound and the other for receiving and displaying images. The cathode ray tube is the main component of the video receiver.</p>
<p>Recently, Germany built a television van. There is a standard motion picture camera on the roof of the van, which can rotate freely in all directions. The hollow camera support is used to transport the filmed footage to the darkroom inside the van body. Using special equipment and rapid chemical reactions, the film is developed. The undried film is divided into 180 lines by the abtastgerat, and each line has a different intensity of current. The image transmitter broadcasts this picture into the air, and radio viewers can receive it.</p>
<h3>Characteristics of the Latest Dual-Function Vacuum Tube 1C6</h3>
<p>— KMK</p>
<p>Since the advent of dual-function vacuum tubes, amateur enthusiasts have been eager to experiment and research with each other. This type of vacuum tube not only provides us with great convenience in its operation but also takes up little space, making it extremely convenient.</p>
<p>The 1A6 vacuum tube is one type of dual-function vacuum tube, and it contains a total of five grids inside. Its detailed characteristics have been introduced in this publication many times. Its standard use is specifically for DC superheterodyne radios. It can be used for first-stage detection and local oscillation, etc. However, in order to save power, the current of each electrode is designed to be low. When used in a superheterodyne radio, as long as the accessories are properly matched, there will naturally be no problems in operation. However, using this vacuum tube in an ordinary regenerative radio cannot achieve satisfactory results. Therefore, in order to improve and refine, manufacturers in various countries have successively introduced the 1C6 vacuum tube. The structure of each electrode inside is the same as that of the 1A6 tube, the only difference being that the current of each electrode is slightly stronger.</p>
<p>The filament voltage of the 1C6 vacuum tube is 2 volts, and the filament current is 120 milliamperes (twice as strong as the 1A6). The maximum plate voltage is 180 volts, the plate current is 1.5 milliamperes, the screen grid voltage is 67.5 volts, and the current is 2 milliamperes. The first grid is the input electrode of the oscillation circuit, the second grid is the positive grid of the oscillation circuit and is used to replace the plate of the oscillation circuit, the current is 0.11 milliamperes, the third and fifth grids are the suppressor grids, and the fourth grid is the high-frequency current input electrode. As for the arrangement of the electrode pins, it is the same as the 1A6. This vacuum tube is not only used in superheterodyne radios with amazing results, but can also achieve considerable results when used in other applications.</p>
<h3>Amateur Notes</h3>
<p>— Liu Tongkang</p>
<p>It goes without saying that everyone knows that a volume control in a radio is used to adjust "overload."</p>
<p>Although ordinary adjustment of regenerative capacitors or filament variable resistors can also increase or decrease the volume, this cannot be considered a good method, and it also reduces the sensitivity of the radio, weakens the effectiveness of the vacuum tube, and damages the filament.</p>
<p>Installing a volume control in the low-frequency amplification stage to limit the input voltage is relatively stable and safe, but difficult problems arise one after another. When this method is used in a radio with multiple stages of high-frequency amplification, the detection stage will be overloaded and produce distortion.</p>
<p>Adjusting the screen grid voltage of the high-frequency amplification tube to control the volume seems to be more effective, but it is not a perfect method either.</p>
<p>At present, the most widely used and effective volume control method is to adjust the C-bias voltage of a variable-mu high-frequency amplification tube to control its amplification factor, while simultaneously increasing or decreasing the antenna input power.</p>
<p>However, in DC radios, after all, due to the structural relationship of the vacuum tube, there are not many applications of this method. In fact, this is not difficult at all. The example introduced here is shown in Figure 1.</p>
<p>V is the high-frequency amplification tube, C is a 0.001 MFD fixed capacitor, R is a 5,000 ohm fixed resistor, RFC is an 85 MH long-wave high-impedance coil, C, is the C-bias (its voltage must be determined according to the vacuum tube, such as No. 43, then 22.5 volts must be used), Ri is the volume control, and the resistance is about 50,000 ohms-100,000 ohms.</p>
<h3>Steps for Assembling a Radio for the First Time (2) (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Xuelun</p>
<p>(3) Power Transformer</p>
<p>A power transformer is also called an AC-DC converter. Its function is to step down AC mains voltage to A voltage to supply the filaments of the vacuum tubes, and another step-up or step-down coil rectifies its current to B voltage to supply the plates of each vacuum tube. Therefore, the power transformer is the power hub of a radio, and the design must be prepared, and the structure must be solid, so that the radio can work legally and last for a long time. The construction content is not only poor in materials, but also the voltage and current are not suitable for our self-assembled radios, so it must not be purchased.</p>
<p>The detailed design method of the power transformer is recorded in this journal and various magazines, so I will not repeat it here. The power required for this machine is about 60 VA, which can be wound by yourself according to the table below. If beginners feel that it is not easy to make by themselves, it is better to entrust a domestic manufacturer to make it.</p>
<p>Asia-America or Zhongyong No. 2 steel sheets to 40 mm thick, weighing about two pounds.</p>
<p>A set of No. 22 iron clips</p>
<p>Primary 220 volts, use American standard No. 26 enameled wire to wind 938 turns.</p>
<p>Secondary high voltage 600 volts, use American standard No. 32 enameled wire to wind 2456 turns, draw the center tap.</p>
<p>Filament 6.3 volts, use American standard No. 18 enameled wire to wind 26 turns, draw the center tap.</p>
<p>Rectifier filament 5 volts, use American standard No. 16 enameled wire to wind 21 turns, draw the center tap.</p>
<p>When winding by yourself, first take a hard cardboard to make a spool, the inner area is 32 mm × 40 mm, soak in molten wax, wrap one or two layers of insulating cloth, then wind the primary winding, and then wrap one or two layers of insulating cloth on the outside, and then wrap a layer of cigarette tin foil on the insulating cloth, the two ends must not be in contact, one end is connected to a wire, and the iron core is grounded. This kind of installation can avoid a lot of AC noise. The secondary high-voltage coil is wound outside the primary winding, and is still insulated with insulating cloth. The outermost layer is wound with two low-voltage coils, insulated with wax paper. After all the coils are wound, insert the steel sheets one by one, and tighten the iron clips. The power transformer is made. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>National Movement and Cultural Movement</h3>
<p>— Ye Qing</p>
<p>People engaged in the national movement often despise cultural movement, thinking that it is a way to pull people into the library. Not only is it unrelated to opposing imperialism, but it also shifts public attention and disperses public strength. Therefore, they not only despise cultural movement, but even curse it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, people engaged in the cultural movement do not understand the significance of the national movement and often think that it is just a way to shout slogans. They advocate saving the country through education and saving the country through science. In the era of the "September 18th Incident," they cited Hegel in the Battle of Jena and called on people to learn from him and concentrate on reading and writing books.</p>
<p>These are all biased and obscured. In fact, the national movement and cultural movement should be unified. Why? Because practice cannot be separated from theory, and theory cannot be separated from practice. They must be</p>
<p>combined with each other to form a complete life course.</p>
<p>Then, the national movement depends on the cultural movement.</p>
<p>First, the so-called national movement should be the movement of the majority of oppressed nations. This requires a theory to awaken everyone, unify their will, and align their steps. However, oppressed nations are often backward nations, and the intellectual level of most of their people is very low. Therefore, spreading theory must be formed into a movement. And there is also the need to improve the intellectual level. This, of course, must be achieved through cultural movement.</p>
<p>Second, the imperialism invasion of oppressed nations has a theory as an excuse, such as the superiority of races, the civilization of backward nations, which sounds very good. And it also uses Christianity to numb the masses and run schools to create foreign slaves. At this time, oppressed nations must have a theory to confront it. If it does not expose its mask, even its own unity will feel difficult because its consciousness is conquered by imperialism.</p>
<p>At this point, isn't it obvious that oppressed nations should have their own cultural movement? This is the starting point and tool of their national movement. The era of the Boxers has passed, and the way of primitive riots and simple xenophobia are no longer needed.</p>
<p>On the other hand, cultural movement also depends on the national movement.</p>
<p>Culture is a tool for human beings to adapt to the environment in order to make a living. When oppressed nations are invaded by imperialism, their survival becomes a problem, and they should link cultural movement with the national movement. That is to say, cultural movement should become a type of anti-imperialist movement.</p>
<p>In this way, the line of cultural movement must be the national movement. In other words, it is the declaration of the spiritual independence and freedom of oppressed nations. Therefore, it should take opposing imperialist culture as its slogan. The Western culture or European culture that people generally talk about is imperialist culture. Hu Shi's welcoming of Western culture and Chen Xujing's complete Westernization are just flowery words and sweet talk that call us to become spiritual slaves of imperialism automatically. Cultural movement with the national movement as its line must oppose the foreign slave comprador in its anti-imperialist consciousness in the culture of oppressed nations.</p>
<p>After the interactive integration of the national movement and cultural movement, both sides will benefit. In terms of the national movement, with conscious masses and guiding theory, it will be modernized and easy to achieve success. In terms of cultural movement, it will have an independent consciousness and a creative spirit, and can keep pace with advanced countries in the fields of discovery and invention.</p>
<p>Here, if the foreign slave comprador who willingly promotes the culture of European imperialism in China sneers at my discovery and invention, I will answer: You have become a lackey of imperialist culture! According to it, white people are the darlings of heaven, and colored people are born inferior. Now you do regard yourself as inferior, and you don't even dare to have the ambition to discover and invent. You are too worthy of being a slave of a fallen country. What about us? We want to be human, we want to fulfill our responsibility for culture, we want to create culture.</p>
<p>Can backward nations create culture? Yes. I have proved in the previous issue of this publication that backward nations can create culture as long as they start from the cutting edge of world cultural development. What about European philosophy, science, and literature? Critically absorb them, eliminating their dross and absorbing their essence. For philosophy, we want new materialism and abandon everything else; for science, we want natural science, and take more facts and less theory for social science; for literature, we want the best of technology and consciousness. As for the new buds that contain the future culture, we will use them as a creative model, promote and glorify them. In short, let oppressed nations get rid of the pain of spiritual colonies and gain the free development they deserve in culture, and from then on become one of the promoters in the advancement of world culture. Isn't this the responsibility of us—people in oppressed nations—who are engaged in cultural movement?</p>
<p>Anyone who does not dare to say that they can create culture, please withdraw from the cultural world. Let us raise the banner of anti-imperialist culture and declare the spiritual independence and freedom of the Chinese nation!</p>
<h3>Several Indexes of the Peiping Library</h3>
<p>— Shilue</p>
<p>(1) Index of National Studies Papers</p>
<p>(2) Index of Literature Papers</p>
<p>(3) Index of Chinese Geography Papers</p>
<p>At present, the compilation methods of Chinese indexes are diverse, and no precise and detailed format has been produced yet. Therefore, when we cite a certain index, we must first understand the editing and indexing methods and its characteristics of this index before it can be useful. The indexes compiled by the Peiping Library, according to the above, have a commonality. Generally, their materials are taken from magazines; their nature is considered a specialized discipline; and their arrangement is based on the content of the articles for classification. Therefore, we can call this type of index "Specialized Classified Index of Magazine Article Titles."</p>
<p>The only feature of this index is to provide researchers in this discipline with great convenience in referring to magazine articles. For example, if we want to study a certain problem in this discipline but don't know where to start, then we can check a certain category in the index; then, from each entry in the category, "follow the clues," and through analogy, the problem can be easily solved. Because of this research method, in terms of depth, one can know the true historical evolution process of the problem; in terms of breadth, one can explore the main points and opinions of various schools—thanks to the editor's preliminary efforts, the articles with the same content are grouped together, the researcher is not only spared the effort of random searching, but also avoids the hard work of blind searching!</p>
<p>However, "classification" has no standard rules in today's Chinese bibliography, especially in papers. I am afraid that even after thousands of years, it will be difficult to establish an immutable rule. Therefore, general bibliographers call "classification" "artistic" rather than "scientific." Therefore, it is almost impossible for a classified index to be perfect and flawless in everyone's eyes; moreover, many papers contain multiple problems, and many are difficult to summarize into a certain category—in this way, it is difficult for the compiler, and it is not easy for the checker. Therefore, when we want to cite this index, the first thing we have to do is to know clearly the categories it divides. Below, I will briefly describe the three books separately.</p>
<p>The Index of National Studies Papers has been published in three series. The first series was published in July 1929. The editor is Mr. Wang Chongmin. Mr. Wang is versed in national studies and is proficient in bibliography. The postscript claims that the editing of this book began in the summer of 1925. It collects 82 magazines, with 3,000 plus papers. Since July 1928, the writings of national studies in the past two or thirty years have been generally collected and compiled. Its classification is: 1. General; 2. Classics; 3. Linguistics; 4. Archeology; 5. History; 6. Geography; 7. Schools of Thought; 8. Literature; 9. Science; 10. Political Science and Law; 11. Economics (attached to Currency, Industry, and Commerce, etc.); 11. Sociology; 13. Education; 14. Religion; 15. Music; 16. Art; 17. Bibliography—this category combines Chinese and Western, transforms the old rules of the Four Treasuries, and marks it with names that adapt to the times. After that, the sequel and the second series followed this pattern, and each subcategory was slightly changed. The sequel was edited by Mr. Xu Xuchang. Published in July 1931. Collect more than 80 chapters. The number of papers is roughly the same as the previous series. The third series was edited by Ms. Liu Xiuye. Published in October 1934. Collects 192 magazines and newspapers, and the number of papers is about twice as many as before. A "Table of the Founding Years of the Collected Publications" is added at the end of the volume, which seems superfluous.</p>
<p>The Index of Literature Papers has been published in a sequel. The first series was published in January 1932. According to Mr. Wang Chongmin's preface, this book and the Index of National Studies Papers were compiled at the same time. It was initially compiled by Mr. Zhang Xinyu, and then by Ms. Chen Biru and Ms. Li Zhixuan of the Peiping Library Index Group. A total of 162 magazines and chapters are collected. From the 31st year of Guangxu to December 1929. The book is divided into three series: upper, middle, and lower. The upper series is a general discussion of literature. The general outline of its classification is: 1. General Theory; 2. Meaning and Origin of Literature; 3. Nature of Literature; 4. Classification of Literature; 5. Literary Trends of Thought; 6. Literary Creation; 7. Literary Criticism; 8. Literati; 9. Literary Research Methods; 10. Literature and Others; 11. Literature of Various Countries. The middle series is a specific discussion of literature. Its outline is: 1. Poetry and Ballads; 2. Rhapsody; 3. Ci; 4. Opera; 5. Fiction; 6. Myths and Stories; 7. Children's Literature; 8. Others. The lower series is a critical biography of writers. Its outline is: 1. Critical Biographies of Chinese Writers; 2. Critical Biographies of Japanese Writers; 3. Critical Biographies of Indian Writers; 4. Critical Biographies of Russian Writers; 5. Critical Biographies of British Writers; 6. Critical Biographies of French Writers; 7. Critical Biographies of German Writers; 8. Critical Biographies of Italian Writers; 9. Critical Biographies of American Writers; 10. Critical Biographies of Spanish Writers; 11. Critical Biographies of Polish Writers; 12. Critical Biographies of Dutch Writers; 13. Critical Biographies of Norwegian Writers; 14. Critical Biographies of Danish Writers; 15. Critical Biographies of Writers from Other Countries and Collective Biographies. There are five appendices: 1. Literary Teaching Methods; 2. Literary Items; 3. Introduction to Literary Books; 4. Introduction to Literary Figures; 5. News from the Literary World. The sequel was edited by Ms. Liu Xiuye. A total of 193 magazines and chapters are collected. Published in November 1933. The content of the collected materials continues the time of the previous series to May 1933, and the division of volumes and classification are roughly the same as before; the subcategories have also been slightly changed. However, this book additionally includes ten literary works, namely: Collection of Chinese Literary Debates, edited by Li Helin; Modern Chinese Women Writers, compiled by He Yubo; Outline of Chinese Literary History, compiled by He Kai; Collection of Literary Essays, written by Guo Moruo; Collection of Literary Freedom Debates, edited by Su Wen; World Writers Biographies, compiled by Sun Songgong; Modern Chinese Writers, compiled by Qian Xingcun; Modern Chinese Women Writers, compiled by Huang Ying; Modern Chinese Women Writers, compiled by Caoye; Modern Critical Biographies, compiled by Modern Bookstore—according to this matter, it is to break the precedent. The ten books collected include collections of papers, miscellaneous biographies, and literary histories, which are different in nature; and each book is not an outstanding masterpiece. Moreover, if Li compiled the Collection of Chinese Literary Debates, and the papers in Guo's Collection of Literary Essays are mostly those that have been included in the previous series—in this way, it is not only contrary to the previous style, and the selection of books is not refined, but also has the suspicion of repetition before and after; I think the editor has not thought about these things?</p>
<p>Index of Chinese Geography Papers. Published in April 1934. The book has two volumes. Co-edited by Mr. Wang Yong and Mr. Mao Naiwen. The magazines collected are from the 28th year of Guangxu to July 1927. The nature of the content papers is not purely limited to geography. All those who describe the natural state and humanistic facts of the region have been included. Its main categories are: 1. Topography and Travel Notes;—Geotext (attached to Antiquities)! 3. Ethnic Groups; 4. Politics; 5. Transportation; 6. Economy; 7. History; 8. Geographical Books. (attached to Chinese Geography and Geographers). At the end of the volume, there are two indexes of place names and authors. It seems that this compilation will enhance its convenience in citation compared with the previous two books.</p>
<p>In addition, I heard that the library also has two major works, the Classified Index of Articles in Qing Dynasty Literary Collections and the Index of Stone Inscriptions, which are still in the process of printing and compilation. It is expected that they will be released to the public soon. (May 24)</p>
<h3>Records of Impressions of Various Bookstores (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Li Hengzhi</p>
<p>Twenty-Two: The Author's Bookstore</p>
<p>In Peiping, there was an "Author's Bookstore," and in Shanghai, there is the Author's Publishing House. The natures of the two are somewhat different. In the Peiping-Tientsin area, there were several "teacher-writers" (because not all were university professors, they couldn't be called professor-writers) who either had no place to print their books, or were being exploited by bookstores, or thought that their books used as textbooks would definitely sell well. So, they organized an Author's Bookstore, investing their own money to print books and handing them over to their own bookstore for sale. The Author's Publishing House also arose from the need for "authors to publish their own books." The difference between it and the Author's Bookstore is that the Publishing House itself is entirely of an intermediate distribution nature, unlike the Author's Bookstore, which is an author's organization, somewhat similar to a publishing cooperative.</p>
<p>In foreign countries, publishers and distributors already have quite specialized organizations, but in China, the Author's Publishing House is still an innovation. It is said that the owner of the Author's Publishing House was previously the director of the Commercial Press consignment department. The Commercial Press took advantage of its many branches and great reputation to ensure the sales of consigned books, and because there were many booksellers who relied entirely on Commercial Press books for their business, they naturally dared not neglect their accounts with the Commercial Press. Therefore, consigning books to the Commercial Press would not have the worry of "not being able to recover the accounts." Now, in addition to the World Book Company, there is the World Publishing Cooperative and the Dahua Book Company for this reason. Since the January 28th Incident, the Commercial Press's consignment department was abolished, perhaps because the person in charge saw the development of the Commercial Press consignment department's business and thus formed the Author's Publishing House themselves. If so, there is indeed a need for consideration in terms of business.</p>
<p>First, the Author's Publishing House cannot be compared to the Commercial Press consignment department. What the Commercial Press consignment department relied on was its numerous branches, and the booksellers in the interior who depended on Commercial Press books for their livelihood dared not delay their accounts, so there was no problem at all with regard to (1) how to promote the books to various places, and (2) how to recover the accounts. But what does the Author's Publishing House rely on now?</p>
<p>Second, if the Author's Publishing House consigns books to various distributors in the interior, difficulties will inevitably arise in terms of discounts and payments. The authors themselves think that handing over their books to the Author's Publishing House for distribution at half price is already as cheap as can be, but if they are then handed over to interior distributors, receiving payment at half price is considered the highest price. Moreover, even if the interior distributors sell the books, they may not immediately hand over the payment, but most authors will not understand this point. This is a serious contradiction, and the first to bear the brunt is the Author's Publishing House.</p>
<p>Third, since the general cultural level in China has not reached a higher level, the number of books published by private individuals and "non-publishing" organizations is not large. It seems very difficult for the Author's Publishing House to rely solely on this as its main source of business. If it still relies on distributing publications from "people in the book business" as its main business commodity, then it is no different from ordinary consignment bookstores—in fact, the Author's Publishing House is gradually tending to go down this road.</p>
<p>Fourth, recently, the consignment business of various bookstores has become increasingly developed. Because their publications are widely advertised, they easily attract readers. For example, the Life Bookstore, the Kaiming Bookstore, and others seem to have surpassed the Author's Publishing House in terms of consignment scope. This may well be a major blow to the Author's Publishing House.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, it is difficult for the Author's Publishing House to succeed. The Author's Publishing House has been established for two or three years, and its failure to fully develop is probably limited by these objective reasons.</p>
<p>Is the Author's Publishing House itself not a publisher? There is no impression to speak of, but its business method is novel and sufficient to attract people's attention. It is often heard that someone suggests that Shanghai bookstores establish a joint sales method, and this method can be considered in light of the situation of the Author's Publishing House.</p>
<p>Li Hengzhi's Notice—Most bookstores generally consider the end of June as the end of the accounting year. I plan to investigate the business situation of various bookstores over the past year as a reference for the publishing industry in the future. I earnestly request that various bookstores provide detailed information on the following points over the past year: (1) the number and types of books published, (2) the amount of business, (3) all difficulties, and (4) future plans. After some slight整理, it will be published in this journal. This matter concerns the future of the publishing industry, and I hope that various bookstores will do their best to help it succeed.</p>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>Truly Unwilling and Unavoidable</h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>The newspaper reported the other day that the Lao Beimen police station recently dispatched patrol police to search for prostitutes soliciting customers along the Minguo Road and Xinqiao Street area. Due to some reason, only two were caught. They were taken to the station for questioning, and so on. The number of prostitutes in Shanghai not only dominates East Asia but can also be said to be the champion of the world. According to statistics from Professor F. of Yenching University, there is one prostitute for every 130 people. Whether this is accurate or not is unknown. But last September, the Public Concession authorities only took three to five days to arrest over two hundred and thirty or forty people, causing the new and old women's prisons in the Municipal Council to be packed to the brim and reeking. This is probably something readers still remember. From this, we can easily imagine that if all the prostitutes in the Minguo Road and Xinqiao Street area were brought to the police station's detention center, it could immediately be "packed to the brim and reeking."</p>
<p>Although this spectacle has not manifested, it tells us the tragic state of this urban pathology. From the confessions of these two prostitutes, we know that they have parents above them and children below them. In order to "support the whole family," they "unavoidably" and "truly unwillingly" resorted to this last resort. I think, without talking about human inequality, just starting from humanitarianism, one cannot help but say that the life of a prostitute is twelve thousand times more miserable and painful. The daily life of seeing off the old and welcoming the new is already equivalent to physiological, mental, and self-trampling, not to mention the layers of dark exploitation and exaction in between. Really, except for those "Pan Jinlian seeds" who are inherently lewd in the world, no one wants to enter this fiery pit, but for the sake of life, it is "unavoidable."</p>
<p>This is the same as the state of suicide. Although everyone knows that life has supreme value, when "everything is empty" or "when people are poor, their ambitions are short," they "unavoidably" go to self-deliverance; Jia Yin is also the same. Everyone knows that making the body a commodity is the most tragic thing, but if you don't take this "last resort," you can only starve to death.</p>
<h3>Returning</h3>
<p>— Juefu</p>
<p>It was a summer evening. The blood-red, proud sun, although still lingeringly hanging on the distant peaks, but the summer's unique evening breeze had already taken away all the heat.</p>
<p>A-Qie, who had eaten many years of grain, with a happy heart, dragging an injured leg, not knowing how many mountains he had climbed, how many rivers he had crossed, the one mountain 　　　 in his mind day and night, was finally glimpsed by him at this moment.</p>
<p>In that one mountain 　　　, hidden a small village of five or six families, in the village was A-Fu's home. Left in his home, was a wife, a son, a mother over sixty years old. He had buried more than thirty years of his life there, every tree there, every stone, every winding and indistinguishable path, he remembered them all: even seven or eight years ago, when he was dragged away to eat grain, how many chickens, how many goats were left in his home... he could still recite these very clearly now. -This home, no, this whole mountain 　　　, he loved it extremely!</p>
<p>He walked many days, and although his body was now exhausted, he was still very happy, very excited, he couldn't wait to jump into that large forest next to the hillside. While 　　　 walking, he was secretly planning: Mother is probably cooking? That one is probably still cutting firewood in the mountains? Little Fuzi might have grown as tall as himself? Dad is afraid that he won't recognize his son? ... A wanderer who had been missing for so many years, this was a sudden return, when Mother saw him, she would surely be overjoyed, no, she would shed tears; when that one saw him, she would surely cry, maybe even scold; even the whole village, would probably cause a small commotion because of his sudden return. He had to tell them what he had experienced</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>everything, he had to state his future plans, wishes, ... all to them, until he taught them to "turn their tears into laughter!" ...</p>
<p>As he thought about this, the smiling expression that had said goodbye to him long ago, now unknowingly floated back onto his gaunt face. He was extremely happy, his whole body and mind, were completely melted in the long river of happiness!</p>
<p>He opened his twice-lost eyes, looking around in the east, looking around in the west, as if he was looking for something he loved most. He compared everything he saw in front of him with the one shadow left in his mind; he always hoped to find something from this comparison to prove the accuracy of his memory. But he failed in the end, the scenery in front of him, looked somewhat unfamiliar to him. He remembered that going forward from the foot of the mountain, there was a foot-wide mountain road, lying on the left side of the mountain road, was a five or six mu large rice field; he also remembered that no matter what evening, looking from the foot of the mountain, he could often see wisps of smoke, floating from the top of the dense green forest, he could see flocks of goats, surrounding their owner, running around everywhere on the hillside, and sometimes he could hear dogs barking, cows mooing, children's noisy voices, ..., but now? The mountain road could not be found, the rice field had disappeared in the weeds: the smoke was gone, the goats could not be seen, the sound of cows and sheep, the sound of children's noise, ..., had also disappeared without a trace! -The whole mountain, was completely submerged in the abyss of loneliness!</p>
<p>A-Fu was a little surprised. He suspected his eyes, suspected his legs, whether he had looked in the wrong direction, walked the wrong road? But when he raised his head again, looked closely at the distant and near mountain peaks, the stone walls and trees attached to the mountain peaks, ... he felt that these were very familiar,亲切, and there was no difference from the one shadow left in his mind. At this time, he was a little flustered, his excited heart, was a little cold. He moved his steps frantically, pushed aside the榛莽, and ran straight into the forest that hid his home. But when he broke in, the terrible scenery that he dared not imagine, appeared in front of him: his home was gone, all the houses, some had completely collapsed, some had been tightly sealed by vines, some had been pierced through the top by wildfires, leaving only four walls standing there! Here, there was no human voice, no barking of dogs, the entire village was filled with a kind of desolate and terrible mist. The mountain birds returning late, were all 高噪着 on the treetops, the dogtail grass growing in the cracks in the walls, was silently nodding there. A-Fu, who had walked across many mountains and rivers with a happy heart, and jumped back, finally fell beside a camellia tree!</p>
<h3>Days</h3>
<p>— Feier</p>
<p>The days pass slowly, and life is getting shorter and shorter. Watching the calendar being torn off page by page, the ruthless years grind life thinner and thinner. In memory, the childhood years still exist vaguely in the brain, that ignorant state of only knowing how to play and not knowing everything, disappears so far away in a flash. Even in adolescence, that wholeheartedly immersed in books, and not knowing the social phenomena of the vast sky containing all things, it still seems like yesterday when I think about it. Unexpectedly, people have crossed many days, and now not only the taste of society and life has been deeply tasted, the spirit is no longer as innocent and lively as it used to be, and the body has obviously been exhausted, not as strong as in adolescence.</p>
<p>People are sometimes really funny and ridiculous; when bored, they look forward to the early passage of days, but when the days have passed, and they recall the sweet past, they are afraid of the coming of the future. The so-called time is inherently rigid with a certain limit, but due to human affairs, it produces the feelings of love or hatred. It is a deep understanding of this principle that says that the value of time changes with human affairs.</p>
<p>I don't know how the days feel to others. For me, the days are very lovely. Often in the midst of busyness, when I see the events to be dealt with still piled up in stacks, I often curse the fast passage of days, and I always remember those events to be dealt with in my heart. Although sometimes my mood will also fall into loneliness and boredom, and I look forward to the early passage of days, but when I struggle with my limp body, try hard to cheer up, and spend time on various favorite careers, the days feel lovely again, and I hope that they can crawl slowly like ants.</p>
<p>Now, when adolescence has passed and old age has not yet arrived, I feel especially precious for the days. The past is already past, and the future has not yet arrived. For the present, I should use this energetic age to engage in my favorite career, so that the days will not be wasted, that is the reason why I cherish my days. Although I don't quite admire the proverb: "If you don't work hard when you are young and strong, you will only grieve when you are old," but I think it is pitiful and tragic if a person cannot make good use of the days to fulfill his wishes or satisfy his upward hobbies.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, people's days often cannot be controlled by people: Heaven has made it necessary for people to spend most of their energy to obtain food to maintain their lives, and the complexity of human affairs often pulls people out of the circle of making good use of the days and turns them to the garbage heap of waste. Human life is short, and the days and the energy of the human body are extremely limited, then although I want to cherish the days, the days are not willing to be cherished by me. Then what is there to say?</p>
<p>In these times, I have a deeper feeling for the days: watching my beard grow longer and denser day by day, but the career I am doing has not yet achieved any results that can be seen. On the other hand, the disputes of human affairs are becoming more and more complicated, almost forcing me into the limit of not being able to freely use my time. This blow can certainly stimulate me to move forward on my way on the one hand, but on the other hand, the consumption of energy is really frightening. I imagine that if one day my energy is exhausted to the extreme and makes me limp and weak, then career will only become a dream for me, the sense of disillusionment at that time must be very deep, and I can't help but curse the un</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>feeling days!</p>
<p>Days, extinguish the grand ambitions of the world, and also achieve the meritorious deeds and greatness of the world, what will it create me into?</p>
<h3>Drought</h3>
<p>— Jieren</p>
<p>When a burst of rapid ringing of the bell shook the space, the people hiding in each small room were whipped as if, and walked out one by one, and gathered together in the market. The entire market suddenly became闹 　哄, arbitrary laughter,杂然充塞 in every corner.</p>
<p>Following the ring of the bell, after another three or five minutes, the clock struck a few times, and the members of the institute, wearing uniforms, walked onto the stage one by one in the ringing of the bell. The words "Opening Market", "June Term", "Opening" and other words were successively turned out on the stage, and the human voice seemed to be slightly suppressed. But when the finger of the auctioneer standing in the center of the stage began to gesture in the air, the people under the stage immediately rioted again. "Two and a half points", "Two points seven and a half points", "Pull, pull", "Pull, pull", you shout, he shouts, shouting straight from the throat. At the same time, dozens of hands stretched out, the air was very tense, and each face showed a panicked look as if facing a great enemy.</p>
<p>The auctioneer's eyes stared at the stage, his fingers constantly making various gestures in the air, while拍板 on the table, his mouth quickly念着:</p>
<p>No. 18 No. 20 two thousand, No. 25 No. 31 three thousand, ...</p>
<p>The recorder sitting next to the auctioneer, his hand was like a fully wound发条, only moving. There on the hanging plate; black background white characters牌子 also迅捷 hung out one by one. Those standing outside the "Non-Brokers Please Do Not Enter"栏外, were all引颈望牌上的 numbers, each person's face expression, there are欣然以喜, and嗒然若丧, as if the entire life is繫 in那块牌 on general.</p>
<p>One after another接运 hung out的牌子, its数字的比数, is一块跟一块的高上去, the market 里 的空气显益发得紧张了。</p>
<p>The market is rising step by step!</p>
<p>Still want to rise! Foreign wheat is also more than one元多.</p>
<p>The rain does not fall, and the旱要成, five or six角行情 is not希奇!</p>
<p>Yes! Seeing, the market will only be good, not small.</p>
<p>Almost as same as last year!</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>市面上議論紛　, everyone with a一副惊愕的神色, to the current形勢,发表各自的意见。</p>
<p>From "Opening", "Second Pan", "Third Pan" to "Closing", the middle is pause for a while. Again接下去 is "July Term" to "August Term" "September Term" "October Term" November Term", and "Opening" to "Second Pan", Third Pan", "Closing", on the 台的拍板人手在动,嘴在喊, the 台下的人也是手在动,嘴在喊, in this way continued,一直到台上转出 "Closing" 二个字, 于是紧张的空气才鬆弛下来, 大家也慢慢的散开了。</p>
<p>Shouren夹在人群中, is out走出塲口, from behind suddenly have person向就撞,回过头一看, is twenty-one号的小李, Little Li is like just small sparrow, 跳跳蹤蹤, 没有一刻安定, closing 之后不是拉谁谈女人,便是找人打架. He向守仁扮扮鬼脸,笑嘻嘻的说:</p>
<p>Rotten big piece head,挑你不死, want treat!</p>
<p>Shouren Although is a胖子,却最恨人叫他"大块头", 因为这显然太不恭敬了. But today Little Li called him "大块头" he non only not气,反而会心的向他笑了笑,管他走到自己的房间去.</p>
<p>一回到房间里,守仁便倒在沙发中,昨夜马将叉得太晏, 刚才又在市塲里嘶喊一阵, 是使他很感到疲倦的. He闭起目,想养一会神,但是他的神经却不让他安静, 想想今天的市面,"自开盘"后就逐步的涨上去, 這樣子, 不要又同去年一样了吗? 蓦地里, 回忆唤醒了他, 去年也是这样呀! 不过去年是眼睁睁的让它白过去, 今年可不能轻放过, 也得学一次乖呀! 前天报上登着, 有几处地方已在闹旱灾, 无论如何, 照這樣子旱象是酿成, 看看天, 太阳血红的, 不要说雨, 恐怕要比去年还要旱得利害吧!</p>
<p>忽然在膝上一拍,元的从沙发里站起来, 在室中踱着, 一会又坐下.</p>
<p>刻刻可以不回出,这几分行情也赚不好,朝后行情正要好哩!</p>
<p>He could not help but resent himself for being too indecisive. It was clear that the market was still looking good, so why did he have to close it back? Although only a small number were closed back, it was possible to earn more, but it became less to earn, and he was always unwilling and懊恼着. But this懊恼毕竟 is also temporary, because he feels that there are even greater hopes ahead, and immediately will be this懊恼不知抛到那里去了.</p>
<p>It's okay, just earn less, there are still more in hand, can not be揑 to have seven or eight角行情不回出, this行情 is not希奇. Drought! The more severe the drought, the better, this行情怕 it not 到吗?</p>
<p>He stood up,伸一伸懒腰,走到窗前望望天空,天空挣蓝的一片,没染半丝云儿,太阳是血血红,高挂在当中.</p>
<p>哈,旱象准成了!</p>
<p>Thus since the language,嘴角浮上 a smile, a满意的微笑呀!</p>
<h3>Outside the Iron Grate Window</h3>
<p>— Li Ang</p>
<p>Two or three months ago, when I passed by here, the house was being renovated. In the warm air flowing with the fragrance of peach blossoms, the masons, carpenters, and apprentice workers were humming folk songs and working busily. Every day, twice in the morning and afternoon, I would always stand there blankly, watching them打地桩. Erecting steel bars,澆氏敏士,砌石块,铺钢板. The child machine喷 angry吐 black coal smoke, "轟隆隆,豁啦啦……" constantly叫着, like a violent drunkard, hate命往 down wooden poles several丈长 into the ground, the soil经 this番倾轧, began伸张各个方面的势力而震动附近一带的房屋.</p>
<p>The ground work完, the walls一天一天的加高, red 色的磗块,灰色的传块,又阔又厚,年紀小的童工搬不上 four or five块便哼　着移不不开步子了. Ordinary居屋 is not need 这样坚实的砖块的, factory house? Not see烟囱和风筒.堆栈? Not配里面有许多墙壁… I put this疑问保持着,等事实来解决.每天,依然有两次,痴呆呆的站着,看许多泥水匠把墙垣向上建……高,高,高,像一堵城堡.</p>
<p>The wall工稈 successful, the climate already is early summer, hot烈的陽光射照着紅色灰色的墙砖和乌黑发亮的屋顶, 里面 the arrangement is not see, I想不会考究,因为从来没有看考究的材料运进除掉自来永管, 电綫,粗糙的铁条以外. There were window holes on the wall, but they were opened so high, and, also, the blacksmith began to install iron gates in each window hole. I have always doubt what is inside? Once asked a瘦猴子般 的铁匠, he却蹲得高高的,带着讨厌的神色俯首望我一眼, I very识相地走了,the ridge似乎出冷汉.</p>
<p>Connected to electricity, iron window inside, from the darkness透出 a few points发黄的柔弱的灯光, also那样的稀少, like烏雲層層浮于天空的夜晚, 偶尔从云隙里见到一二颗星粒般的. My this颗探求奇迹的心始终叫我留意这座坚牢的屋子的进展. But, that row装铁栅的窗口又装上铁皮罩子了,留一个空口向天空,空口四沿又镶上钢刺,锐利得惊心, 这是防范的设置呵! I 从此认识了这座屋子的威严.</p>
<p>My料想: 铁窗栅里面一定黑暗得不成世界了,难道将来住这屋子的人不喜欢光明?人类是不习　生活在黑暗中的,那么,故意把光明摒隔在外面,而不给予人们享受,总不能不算为是一种　　吧?</p>
<p>Isn't it, no matter that wall有多么厚,终只是一墙的阻隔罢了. The daily sun, the daily moonlight, the daily清快的 wind and naturally flowing气息会降临到铁栅窗外.</p>
<p>The iron栅窗外更替着四季的气候和景色.漂流着孩子的笑,妇女的笑,一切活跃的聲音, 和悅的聲音. They have iron栅窗里的人虽有眼睛却看不见季节的脸,虽有耳朶却听不见自然的欢声. They are being restricted to their world 过着同一本日历上的光阴. Today I walk through here,见红墙脚下已生了几颗靑草,沾着雨露,欣欣向荣, 这在铁栅窗一里是不会有的吧! I瞪着忧愁的眼睛望着地上.、</p>

<p>"Dream of the Red Chamber: Lament of Xiangfei"</p>
<p>A life adrift, devoid of joy, Miss Lin murmurs to herself beneath the silk gauze window. Oriole, having received Bao Yu's instructions, comes to deliver a precious gift and calls out from within. Zijuan, hearing this, rushes to greet her, welcoming her into the Xiaoxiang Pavilion with smiles and words of cheer. Oriole says it's just a small token, expressing his sentiments, a local product from the South for Miss Lin. Soon, Oriole is seen returning to the inner chamber, while the maiden sits in a daze, her brows furrowed. This is all because seeing the gift stirs up memories of her homeland, and now she no longer resides in Jiangdu but in the capital. Ill-fated beauty, Heaven is too cruel. How painful it is that her parents passed away so early. Her uncles and aunts, closest relatives, have all left this world, and even her siblings are gone. She can only rely on her uncle's family to live, and this kind of daily life is like enduring suffering. Who would specially come to the capital to visit her, bringing some products from Yangzhou for her? Thinking of this, her heart breaks, and she wishes she could end this life instantly. The clever Zijuan quickly tries to comfort her, her words flowing like a waterfall, saying, "My lady, your body is usually so delicate. Since taking medicine, it has been very effective. It's not good to be worried, depressed, and keep it bottled up in your heart. My lady, Oriole brought you something from the South. You should be grateful for Miss Xue's deep affection. My lady, the master and mistress both pity you, constantly caring for you and inviting doctors. You must cherish your precious body and not let excessive worry lead to illness. My lady, opening your heart is the most important thing. In the future, you will surely have good fortune." Miss Lin doesn't believe these good words and is filled with sorrow. Fortunately, Master Bao Yu comes to comfort the beauty in person, and she then turns her frown into a smile.</p>

<h3>"Metropolitan Landscape" - Essence Record</h3>
<p>Life in the metropolis is like the scenery in a kaleidoscope, colorful and ever-changing, unfolding scene after scene every day. We, who live within it, rarely get a complete picture due to various reasons. The play "Metropolitan Landscape," written and directed by artist Yuan Muzhi, gathers many essences of the metropolis into one, including the old goods stalls that hide filth, the ever-changing stock exchanges, the pawnbrokers who exploit profits, the disguised gambling of candy peddlers, and the bookstores that promote culture. As for the pathological aspects of the metropolis, like the patients groaning in the beds of sanatoriums, the emaciated starving people in the slums, all kinds of shapes and colors, Wu Yin Xian uses his camera to shake out the deformed monsters of the metropolis.</p>
<h3>Fragments of "The Jade Horse"</h3>
<p>In Xu Xinfu's "The Jade Horse," there is a scene of a morphine production factory, the set design of which took great effort. The props used are especially complex. For the item of Chu medicine bottles alone, thousands of medicine bottles were purchased from glass bottle manufacturers.</p>
<p>The old woman, Gong Jianong, plays a villain selling drugs in "The Jade Horse." Wang Zhenxin plays a detective squad leader. Yan Yuexian plays a shrewd and capable socialite. Between them, there is also a tragicomedy of a love triangle.</p>
<p>Sun Min and Gu Lanjun are siblings here. Sun Min is a young master who lives day to day in a daze, while Lanjun is a smart, capable, and sensible girl.</p>
<p>The opening scene of "The Jade Horse" is a cartoon. In the picture, there is a ferocious demonic shadow. On the right side of the black demonic shadow, there are many demonic flames, their light blazing. On the left side, there are many people who have not been poisoned. The demonic shadow jumps, making seductive gestures. Then, many people walk past the demonic shadow and all become weak and powerless. Suddenly, an electric light flashes and there is a thunderclap. The black demonic shadow immediately flees, and gradually an anti-drug order appears. This very meaningful cartoon is concise and to the point, expressing the main theme of the play even more clearly.</p>
<p>The ending of "The Jade Horse" is that the drug production factory is busted, Yan Yuexian is killed by stray bullets, Gong Jianong is arrested, and the owner of the drug trafficking business is also killed, which makes the audience clap their hands with joy.</p>
<p>The directorial techniques of "The Jade Horse" show that every aspect has been deeply considered and carefully planned. The actors of "The Jade Horse" all fit their roles perfectly, performing with competence and pleasure. The settings of "The Jade Horse" are all magnificent and splendid, novel and worth seeing.</p>
<h3>Everyone Flocking to See "Triumphal Song"</h3>
<p>According to general film distributors, as long as it is a film directed by Bu Wancang, there is no need to see a sample film, and it can be booked in advance. The reason for this is of course due to the good results Bu Wancang has achieved over the years. Looking at his direction of the film "Humanity," wherever it goes, everyone flocks to see it, which makes film distributors tremble with excitement.</p>
<p>Recently, the tragic and tortuous plot of Bu Wancang's "Triumphal Song" can truly be called an unparalleled masterpiece. Moreover, with early disaster as the background, it can also arouse the sympathy of the people of the country. In particular, Bu Wancang's hard work on this film is astonishing. Every hour, the composition is meticulously studied, and the facilities are all novel and powerful. As for the acting being divine, that goes without saying.</p>
<p>"Triumphal Song" is two-thirds completed. Inquiry letters from theaters everywhere have already poured in. It was once heard that a certain film distributor said, "The beginning of the year is not good, but I still have a glimmer of hope, namely Bu Wancang's 'Triumphal Song.'" The phrase "In the future, everyone will flock to see 'Triumphal Song'" can truly be a portrait of Bu Wancang.</p>
