<h3 id="c20">對於四聖奉祀官之希望 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>自四聖奉祀官就職。有謂為無殊日月之重光。亦有謂是乃復古之表徵。其實孔子之道。自有其不可磨滅者在。决不能以一般人之毀譽而增損其毫末也。</p>
<p>中山先生嘗謂中國政治哲學。為歐美所不及。而所謂中國政治哲學者。大抵屬於孔子學說之體系。中山先生又諄諄以恢復中國固有之道德技能為言。此指忠孝仁愛信義和平以及正心誠意修身齊家治國平天下。固無一非孔子之道也。</p>
<p>吾人所當學於孔子者。試舉重要諸點言之。（一）學其為學之精神。孔子之時。竹簡木刻。得書至難。且藏之官中。非士大夫不得閱讀。散在列國。又非集中整理。無後研究。孔子來自民問。而能盡窺羣書之奧。復求其所不知者。問樂於　弘。問禮於老聘。問官於鄭子。學琴於師襄。刪詩書。訂禮樂。修春秋。贊周易。以其為學之勤且專。故能有此偉大之成就。孔子嘗言其為學之道矣。曰。「吾非生而知之。好古敏以求之者也。」又曰。「發憤忘食。樂以忘憂。不知老之將至。」足見其求學典趣之濃厚。至老不倦之精神。視今之一得常識便引為滿足。與夫未嘗讀書而妄肆批評者。其相去不可以道理計。且將官中之學。普及於民問。傳而之四方。孔子之功也。微孔子。中國文明之發展。必將遲延多少時期矣。</p>
<p>（二）學孔子之敎學精神也。孔子因材施敎。有敎無類。故其所造就者衆。其敎人也以詩書六藝。六藝者。禮樂射御書數也。禮樂所以陶冶品性。發揚情感。射御所以習武事。强身體。書數則為一切科學之根本。身心兼修。文武相資。名實俱重。故其所敎育成材老亦衆。自後世但知以詩書敎人。不知以六藝敎人。而尙文之積習以成。自在上者以六經取士。籠絡人心。開獵取高官利祿之途徑。而孔學遂不堪問矣。自以規行矩步。靜坐空談。為居敬窮理之功。而民族萎靡。國勢衰弱。至不可收拾矣。故孔子敎學之精神亡。亦卽中國積弱。之所由來也。</p>
<p>（三）學孔子之奮鬥精神也。孔子之世。一列國爭奪之世也。强凌弱。衆暴寡。有強權。無公理周。天子徒擁虛名。不能制諸侯之橫行。戰爭不絕。人民塗炭。孔子乃欲以仁義之道。藉古聖先王之名。服諸侯之心。拯人民於水火。故栖栖皇皇。不遑寗處。度其東西南北之生活。此其為國為民為道之精神。實深入乎人心。足為後世法也。</p>
<p>（四）學孔子大無畏之精神也。孔子不畏强禦。誅少正卯墮三都。其明證也。故其修春秋。筆則筆削則削。而亂臣賊子懼。又能折衝於樽俎之間。弭患於俄頃之際。當其佐魯公以會齊侯於夾谷也。萊人刧之以兵。孔子責以大義。齊侯慚。乃返魯之侵地以謝過。設無孔子之大無畏精神。烏能退萊夷之兵。而收回失地於壇玷之間耶。</p>
<p>（五）學孔子尊王攘夷之精神也。當孔子之世。夷狄之雜居中國者。其勢漸張。孔子憂之。故創尊王攘夷之說。以引起羣衆之注意。所謂尊王者。名為尊周王。而對夷狄言。周王乃為中國之代表。尊王實卽尊中國也。雖孔子之後。夷狄之為患於中國者。有五胡之亂。有遼金元淸之入主中國。而終能光復舊物者。皆為孔子尊王攘夷之說猶能深入於人心也。後人果能實行孔子之道。「殺身成仁。」「舍生取義。」則民族精神斯可發揚矣。</p>
<p>近人對於孔子之道。常「不得中道而與之。」崇之者幾欲比之於耶佛。要知孔子學說。乃人道而非神道。不具備宗敎之條件也。至欲以讀經救國。求之論理不可通。求之事實不可能。惟孔子之道。為吾人不可不知之道。而此浩如烟海之經籍。深奧之文句。漸不能為現代人所誦讀。則如何使人人有得知孔子學說之機會。此其繼述整理之工作。不得不望諸聖賢後裔。孝經之引詩曰「無念爾祖。聿修厥德。」四聖奉祀官其念旃。</p>

<p>（一）蒙古當局雖已證明日本軍官犬養及其隨從俄人哈布拉於蒙古境內被捕、雖此二人對此已有書面證明、但此二人在接得君等要求之前卽已釋放、此可證明蒙古之善意及渴望和平、（二）當些一人釋放時、彼等所有物之大部（包括馬及馬車）亦均發還、為求更進一步表示其和平願望、蒙古且將彼等所有物之被扣部份、全部送還日本軍官及其同伴、（三）為求避免再有邊境事件發生、蒙古提議召集蒙滿共同委員會、以就地審査各種邊境事伴、（四）余等提議此委員會、應設置於日本軍官及其隨從俄人六月二十三日被捕之境內、蒙古預先聲明、如能證明彼等被捕於滿洲境內、願向滿洲道歉、並懲罰負責拘捕人員、（九日塔斯電）</p>

<p>長江輪警犬查烟　嚴禁茶房私販　不准旅客吸烟</p>
<p>中央厲行禁烟、全國限期肅淸、各方均在積極進行中、唯江海輪船、因在水上流動、依然販土售吸、視若無覩、現在禁烟機關、對於水道商輸、亦已着手嚴査、且用警犬協助、業已破獲多次、茲先從長江船起、碳禁私販售吸、並請輸公司協助矣、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>江輪販吸長江輪船、向為私運川土之策源地、自上海厲行檢査後、江輪運帶烟土、已有戒心、但洋旗船內茶房、仍有私售燈吸·供客購買、及下水時夾帶私土、赴各埠私售者、依然不絕、殊於烟禁前途、大有妨礙、故禁烟檢査隊、對於江輪厲行稽査、己經切實試辦、期將長江船私土來源與販售燈吸節、根本肅淸、</p>
<p>警犬稽查首都禁烟稽查隊、懲於江輪茶房等詭計百出、收藏極密、卽有携帶、難於檢獲、該隊隊長董良翰等、特訓練警犬檢査隊、專任搜索江輪之責工其法係令警犬登輪、至各處房間及艙內、利用犬鼻嗅覺、比較人力搜查、事半功倍、縱令密藏、終被警犬嗅出、此次該隊試用警犬查烟、已在長江輪中破獲一案結果人證均獲、</p>
<p>破獲私土警犬斑在南京、試査江輪烟土時、適招商局江新輪、由漢下水抵京、檢査隊隊長董良翰·分隊長周鏡淸·率帶警犬數頭、上船搜抄、初時遍査無有、及至官艙基號房間、警犬突向該艙門狂吠、分隊長周鏡淸、令管理此艙茶房、將門開啟、檢視之下、未有形跡發覺、後由警犬、在該艙複壁板內嗅出、卽經拆視、內有私土三十餘兩、並已煎成烟膏無數、更有烟具全套、復命警犬嗅尋帶土之犯、乃將茶房蔣正島拖住、訊問一過、確為渠所帶、立卽解送法院究辦、</p>
<p>輪局嚴禁此案發生後、招商總局得到該隊報吿、已由劉鴻生向江新船長査詢、知係茶房所私帶、除將長江輪茶房、改辦一新章、厲行登記、而將行為不正者、分別斥退外、同時由總局發布通吿、遍貼該局所有各江輪中、（一）嚴禁船上茶房等私帶禁物、犯者立予法辦不貸、（二）禁止船上私自燈吸、卽旅客有自帶烟具等、亦所不許、（三）將此禁令及取締辦法、張貼各艙、</p>
<h3 id="c136">招商局　擴展南華四新輪航業 <a href="#c136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>縮減行駛程期……改爲十日一趟　年可增廿四班……多收七十餘萬</p>
<p>招商局新海輪、自開航以來、因客票低廉、艙位優異、營業甚佳、今香港已允給發客牌、交涉成功、以總船主沈際雲堅持之决心、開中國航界未有之先例、不特國體攸關、于航權亦爭回不少也、今局內銳意發展、增加班次、年可盈餘數十萬元、茲將詳情査述如下、</p>
<p>港方騐船</p>
<p>七月一日起、香港政府、已承認中國輪可以取得香港客牌、華人船主、不必再經考騐、招商局海亨海利海貞等三船、本可由滬赴港時、卽開售香港客票、惟為愼重航程計、該三輪在赴港時未售港票、蓋船到香港時、卽請香港港務局上船騐勘、卽行請港當局給發客牌、須俟此客牌取得、方可出售港客票、故該三船必下班至滬、始可發售港票也、</p>
<p>旅客擁護</p>
<p>四海輪自將頭二三等船票價減低後、旅客之多、也于意外、幾斑班滿船、最近半個月來、各該海輸離滬時、甚至後到之客、無票可售、而由粵汕各埠來滬亦然、故四海輪客脚之售額、超出預定數目、近數班四海輪往來南華一次、僅乘客票價、實收恒在七千六七百元、船未進口、定艙位者已紛至査來矣、</p>
<p>增派航班</p>
<p>現在四海輪每行南華汕港厦粵一趟、往來行期、約十二日半、然在實際上、殊不需此多時、各船常在較預定日期提前進口、茲該局鑒於此路營業之佳、收入之巨、船行可以增快、决議將四海輪航程期縮短、改為每十天一趟、則一個月內至少可多行兩次、全年卽可多開二十四趟、每趟貨脚兩項、至少可收三萬元、則全年可增加七十二萬元、各項開支照舊、不過燃煤略予增多耳、</p>
<p>計劃實行</p>
<p>關於四海輪之加班行駛、年可多得巨額運費、而於支付庚欵本息、可綽乎有餘、故劉鴻生總經理已諭業務科主任何墨林、總船主沈際雲、船舶科主任等會商、迅將四新輪增班之事、早日實現、今各主任已在改訂四船之沿途航程、與留停時日、並計議縮短海程等等、一俟通盤籌委、便卽實行、大致不久卽可實現也、</p>

<p>担保事務實則被吿與廠內風馬牛不相關、被吿平日係在事務所內辦公、問、這據上程李恬志為何不簽字、答、她不識字、所以不簽字而蓋章、對於法律上亦可以發生同等效力等語、訊至此、時已過午、官諭展期再審、被吿徐益、諭着收押、徐聆諭當庭請求仍交原保、並稱被吿身為律師、决無逃亡之虞、問官謂曰本案情節重大、　雖准允、乃命　丁帶下收押候示、</p>

<p>下屆在柏林舉行之世界運動大會、歐洲各國咸在積極籌備、波蘭各界、尤感甚大興趣、業由體育專家組織出席世運籌備委員會、經過最精密選拔、已决選送者、計田徑賽員八人、拳術員八人、賽船員十人、劍術員八人、馬上球隊、足球隊、籃球隊各一隊、騎術員十一人、及滑氷員六人、已選中各選手、均送至中央體育館嚴格訓練、</p>
<p>田徑實力</p>
<p>波蘭參加世運之田徑隊、取精兵主義、故僅選取最高紀錄保持者男女八人、去的波蘭田徑隊與意大利交戰、結果意大利以六十九與五十四之比獲勝、但在波羅的海各國運動會中、波蘭以一三四分佔首位、愛少尼亞一二九分第二、拉脫維亞七十二分第三、又去年波蘭女田徑隊員曾應聘訪日、以六十二對三十七分獲大勝、應選之田徑員最著名者為郭索新斯基、萬米二萬米三萬米之長途賽跑、曾戰敗世界冠軍芬蘭選手諾米氏、大會中當有一番極劇烈之角逐也、女子方面現握有世界短距離賽跑紀錄之淮蘭息芝小姐、為舉世所稱道、最近百米有十一秒成績、二百米有二十四秒成績、包辦冠軍、亳無問題、其次為握有世界女鐵餅紀錄之威斯小姐、睥睨一切、殊難與之爭勝也</p>
<p>球隊狀况</p>
<p>波蘭各項球隊實力、雖不能謂為最強、但實力確在水平綫以上、足球實力、依去年作戰經過而言、則曾以三對三和奧國、一對零勝德國、二比三敗於瑞典、馬上球隊及籃球隊亦極強硬、至網球方面、去年台杯賽中、曾以四比一勝保加利亞、五比零勝愛沙尼亞。希臘·丹麥、而二比三敗於法國、波蘭全國網球錦標希勃遠、曾戰勝法國網球名將鮑羅屆拉、</p>
<p>滑氷劍術</p>
<p>歐洲極注重比劍、去年在華沙舉行之歐洲劍術比賽大會、波蘭獲第六及第八名、團體賽中獲第三席、滑氷賽中、去年波蘭曾以三十比十八勝捷克、著名選手郭威西及畢拉小姐、曾獲歐洲錦標賽中第三名、又奈林小姐　啟羅米空距離賽中、獲得十秒又五九·八秒之世界紀錄、又女子射箭、波蘭去年獲世界錦標、寇可斯夫人則獲世界個人錦標、輕重量拳擊去年波蘭敗於德國及匈牙利、但戰勝奧國及捷克、故明年大會中必有一番劇戰也、</p>

<p>— 朱少飛</p>
<p>孩子時喜歡跟同夥割羊草的孩子們捕松鼠養的，瞧見樹上邊了有窩，總得拼命那末地搶在前爬上樹，衣衫給樹枒撕破了，甚至忙昏得草籃會空空地回到家裏去，給媽媽打，挨餓，是常有的事。</p>
<p>現在已近三十歲的人了，仍是這末的孩子氣，有相熟的人回鄉去，誠懇地託他們給我買一隻來，可是總會說着忘記了，或是買不到的話來回答我，想來要他們帶這種東西太麻煩了吧？</p>
<p>去年春天裏，三弟來申學生意的時節，他進門第一句話就說着：「二哥我袋裏給你帶一隻松鼠呢。」他把行李放下了手，松鼠就在袋裏掏出來交到我的手掌裏。開懷呵，欣喜地把它安置在一變開着方洞的紙匣裏，晚上捧着放在枕頭邊。</p>
<p>手有一下閒喂着牛乳跟蛋糕給它吃。因着家人不時給我不入耳的語調：「養了松鼠可靠着有飯吃了，比侍候爸媽更孝順呢，」他們又希望着阿松有給小花貓當老鼠吃掉的一天，阿松像是跟他們有了深仇似的，可是小花貓早跟它做了同伴了，小花貓跳到東它也跳到東，它跳到西小花貓也跟着到西。</p>
<p>天微明它就打窗洞口爬出去玩了，「啷啷」地響着頸項邊的銀解譯子。我在閒着時要它來逗着玩，叫一聲「阿松來！」它就在遠遠的地方飛般地來了，跳上了我的身，偎在懷裏邊，怪親熱地就像捨不得離着我出去玩了。</p>

<p>風凉茶館在我們的鎭落上是應時的特產，但和秋扇一般命薄，只要秋風一起，就被人捐棄了!然而在炎炎的盛暑，也算挺出風頭。因為距離鎭上太遠，所以聰明的老闆就利用女子來招徠茶客。茶客們沒有一天不在擁擠的，每天自晨至晚總是座無隙位，可是風凉的本旨早已失却了，你倘去喝一碗茶，受到人們擁擠的一股熱氣，會使你熬受不住。但是這班茶客天天像「如蟻附羶」，老闆却笑逐顏開的像一尊彌勒佛，來了一位主顧。就忙不迭喚女堂倌泡茶，這可算他夏季大宗收入的妙法。</p>

<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十六回　簾幕隱啼痕難逃冷眼衣冠誇幸運曾到權門</p>
<p>他想到了這裏，就戚到這個世界不但是醜惡而已，實在是殘忍。於是情不自禁的伸手在桌上一拍。恰好這桌上的媒油燈，巳有了相當的年齡，燈心的轉扭，已經很是鬆動，在這一下桌子震動的當中，燈心辮子突然向下一落，幾乎熄滅。志前這末醒悟過來，自己為這事，已經動了手了。這眞有些奇怪，朱月英的事，和自己有什麽相干？要這樣的生氣。難道眞個要白捨一百五十塊錢，免得這姑娘出賣不成？那樣一來，不但賈多才彼此要結下深仇大恨，就是王北海也會更種下了誤會。而且這一百五十塊錢，也僅僅只能維持朱月英的現狀，在他那種惡劣的環境之下，恐怕遲早還要是被賣掉。白捨一百五十塊錢，又有什麽用？自言自語的說了一聲睡罷，這就上床展被睡覺了。這很讓人感到奇怪，天天晚上所蓋的被，這時展動着，彷彿有一陣微微的脂粉香氣，送到鼻子裏面來。為了這種香氣，向然又會聯想到朱月英身上去。所以頭靠到枕上以後，眼睛雖然閉上，心裏頭反是極其慌亂，什麽所在，都牽連着想到。似乎聽到前面大客堂裏的掛鐘，打了兩下嚮。心裏想着，像月英那女孩子，雖然，是很柔懦的樣子，只管讓人去欺侮。但是看他的一種潛意識，却是很能抵抗，也許他對於賈多才這種惡魔，這個時候，還在作最後的掙扎，要擺脫開來。那末，這個時侯，他正需要着人去帮助他了。（二六一）</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>因為那濾器的網眼做得還不怎樣精細的緣故，第一次濾過之後，仍有少許藥渣留在藥汁內，還當然是不能送去給太后喝的：於是他們便三番兩次的濾着，直濾到完全沒有渣澤了，才敢傾入太后的玉碗中去。可是藥汁儘有多咧！而且是特地多煮的他們便把那四柄磁杯也一起注滿了，我不禁懷疑還有誰要喝送個藥啊？</p>
<p>此刻是一切都準備好了，便有人去奏明了太后，不一會，這人又帶着太后的懿旨退出來了，吩咐那四位御醫一起再進伊的便殿中去。於是太后的那柄玉碗在前引領，我第二，其次便是四位御醫，殿後的是一個太監捧着那四柄磁杯。到了太后的前，四位老爺還要先瞌一套頭，然後跪下。我瞧那玉碗授到了太后的手內，急回頭去瞧時，只見那四個小磁杯却已分別捧在四位御醫的手內了；顯然很尷尬地捧着，但每個人都在竭力的忍耐。接着，就像軍操一樣齊整地把磁杯凑到各人的嘴唇上，仰起脖子，一飲而盡。我那時眞覺十二分的出平意外，差不多就要笑出來了，好容易才忍住：並且我想到藥汁必然是很苦的，他們竟能這樣一口氣的吞下，眞非訓練有素不辦。而且我仔細瞧他們臉上，簡直一些表情都沒有，這股勇氣倒着實可以佩服！（三六一）</p>

<p>— 汪敏</p>
<p>曩於該書之餘，搜集今物而古稱者如干，為文刊諸本刊：意在供談助也。茲復續有數條，因並誌之。</p>
<p>吾人日常所用之物，燈檠古稱玉荷，席則古稱　苗，苗適作曲，故又稱　曲。女人之裙古稱繞衾，半臂則古稱繡掘。又燭台古稱蓮炬，蓋其器以金為蓮花之形，是蓮炬本非燭名也。</p>
<p>摩登女性，近多以蔻丹染指甲，作深紅淺絳之色，美麗悅目，較舊時用鳳仙花搗汁而染色者，自更可愛。按古有甲煎之名，據李義山詩註：陳帆據漢宮香方之語，謂是以一種香木末黃如蜜房者，合香收氣，煎時以指試，至脂凝甲上……。又據陳藏器云：甲煎以請藥及美果花燒灰，和　治成，可作口脂，想亦如蔻丹之類耳。</p>
<p>今時食品而古代別有名稱者，其見之古籍，尤為不鮮，如角黍於南史宋時，名曰裹蒸。燒餅於唐元宗時，名日胡餅。元宵卽湯糰，而古名糖糙。　子古稱寒具。饅頭古稱籠餅。又以鷄鴨生魚等名種乾肉凍成之食品，古亦有稱：而曰「瘃臘」。</p>
<p>小兒玩具，有所謂抽陀羅者，吾鄉俗各地鴿子，古時亦有此器，稱之「空鐘」，按其形製，卽地鴿子也。</p>
<p>近以測氣候者曰天文台，且有儀器，第前代亦有此法，按後漢書，戴有候氣之法，竹為管，葭莩為灰，為室三重，布緹縵室中以為案，加律於上，氣至灰飛云云，此項候氣之所，名曰緹室，意卽天文台歟？</p>

<p>— 沿</p>
<p>靑谷村莊，是屬於日本鳥取縣的氣高郡，在歷史方面，也有相當地位，因為在古時平民的殘黨，經過壇浦戰爭失敗後，侍奉天皇及神器，逃到其地，故在靑谷　莊附近的岩美郡字部野村地方，有安德天皇的陵墓。等到慶長年間，豐臣秀吉侵略朝鮮，當地有靑年名呌磯邊十四郞的，在沙塲上屢建奇功，受到天皇的賞賜，因此靑谷村落的名稱，日本人都熟悉起來了。</p>
<p>全村莊的人口，約四千名，姓以「磯邊」「岩鼻」「海節」「小岩」「蛇穴」「岩道」「竹林」「冲島」等為多，名以「申松」「末子松」「淸正」「岩松」「　　」「　　」「　　」「　　」為多，所以在村莊以外的人，只要問起姓名，就可知道那人是否從靑谷村莊來的。</p>
<p>村莊一帶盛行大家族主義，普通每家人口，自六七名以至二十名，根據他們的習慣，長子先結婚，遂後次子三子，順次結婚，結婚以後，各夫婦都在一室裏生活，就是到了四十歲或五十歲的時候，兒女成羣，弟兄等仍在一處生活的，也不以為奇。如果家長死了以後，長男獵任為一戶之主，在日本呌做戶主，同時次男三男，就各携妻子兒女，實行分家，所謂分家，實在限於經濟，不能建造住房，所以往往由長子略給資財，使他們到北海道樺太等地方去經商，或作移民到南美洲東三省的，每年也不在少數，他們自成為一種派別，呌做靑谷村落系。</p>
<p>從靑谷村莊各家的家長，組織一種集會，每月在磯邊氏的家裏，舉行一次，每兩月選舉「島頭」一次，島頭就是統制該村莊的最高權威者，各家長都有選舉權和被選舉權，當選島頭到了以後，就負責管理全村莊的事務，島頭得雇用辦事員六人，襄理一切村務。</p>
<p>磯邊氏的家產，非常寬大，所以這村莊的市塲，也附設在裏面，同時兼有倉庫的效用，而這村莊最有共產意養的生活，却在生產的分配一點上，普通男子結網採薪，女子種菜縫衣，到了一定的時日，各人都拿了自己的東西，聚集在磯邊的家裏，由鳥頭和辦事員，按照供需的關係，决定市價，由供需兩方，各將自家所需要而應當受領的東西，拿回家裏，剩餘的東西，就歸公有，島頭視察當日的勞働狀態，分別給予動勞賞金，這種分配辦法，完全是共產性質，差不多是像在數千年前的原始時代。</p>
<p>根據這村莊的規定，凡滿十五歲以上的男女，分配時都得受領一分，十五歲以下的，只能受領半分，襁褓幼兒，只能受領三分之一，凡是做直接勞働的人，得享受分紅權，長期生病的人，或是殘廢者，也得領受半分，至於當兵遊學的人，同樣地享受全分，他們過着這種特殊生活，所以對於法律知識，簡直可以說沒有，我預備去考察一次，探得群情以後，再吿讀者。</p>

<h3 id="c226">「奇事中的奇事」 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>十年前，看了上海戲劇協社的娜拉公演，（用歐陽予倩改編本愧儡之家）扮娜拉的王毓淸女士體貼入徵，把觀衆都威動了：每個人耳裏都響着「奇事中的奇事」那一句話。前週看了上海業餘劇人的娜拉公演，扮娜拉的藍蘋女士更能表現娜拉的堅强意志，觀衆更感動了；那句「奇事中的奇事」依舊縈繞在每個人的耳裏。究竟等待了十年或百年，這「奇事中的奇事」會眞實地出現不？我曾經幾次這樣推想過。</p>
<p>娜拉對郝爾茂說：『柯樂克的信在信箱裏的時侯，我萬想不到你會服從他的條件。我以為你一定要對他說，「你儘管發表這件事！」發表之後，我以為你一定會挺身出來把一切罪名都擔在自己身上，說道，「這件事情是我做的。」』郝爾茂說：『我日家替你做事，忍窮忍苦，我都願意。但是世上沒有男子肯為了他所愛的女子犧牲自己名譽的。』假使換一個說法，郝爾茂果然挺身出來把一切罪名都擔在自己身上，他願意為了他所愛的女子犧牲自己的名譽，奇事果然出現了，那就怎樣呢？娜拉可以很快樂地住下去嗎？英國有一年輕姑娘，在不幸的機會給暴徒强姦了，她曾在公堂露面一次。從此她變成畸零的人，無論親友故舊都避之若晚。後來有一靑年思想家，他眞誠地愛上了她，和她結了婚，可是社會還是那麼一個古老社會，那對夫婦永遠是畸零的夫婦，只好遠離他們自己的家鄉躲到山谷中去。所以奇事卽算是出現了，而社會上的定型禮法，傳說思想，宗敎經典，法律條文，依舊板着鐵靑的檢孔對着他們，他們這一對也還是非屈優或逃避不可。</p>
<p>所以娜拉不再期待奇事的出現，她要期待那「奇事中的奇事」；其體地說：她相信有一天，定型禮法破滅了，傳統思想倒墮了，宗敎經典毀棄了，法律條文改變了，目前這社會完全換個樣兒了，那才是奇事中的奇事眞實出現。娜拉說：『我相信第一要緊的，我是一個人，同你是一樣的人——或者至少我要努力做一個人。我知道大多數人都同你一樣說法，並且書上也是那樣說。但是從今以後，我不信大多數人同書上說的話了。一切的事情，總得我自己去想，總得我自己明瞭懂得。』這是一種挑戰的姿態，她站在世界面前，說：『我要看看究竟是我錯了還是世界錯了。』</p>
<p>娜拉走了以後，郝爾茂忽然起了一種希望心，自言自語道：『啊！奇事中的奇事？』這奇事中的奇事，當然不獨對於娜拉是一種希望，對於郝爾茂也是一種希望。不過坐在海岸中看風雲，不肯駕駛着生命的船到狂風暴雨中去掙扎，如何能搖得到彼岸？娜拉也罷，郝爾茂也罷，終究是一種期待而已，我從金城大戲院走了，胸中有這樣一種空虛的感想。</p>
<h3 id="c227">東海記 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 沃圃</p>
<p>—曲拾—</p>
<p>東海記，太曾王曦（季旭）撰。有道光十一年宛鄰書屋刋本。衍漢東海孝婦事。</p>
<p>王曦這個人的生平，不很群細知道。所能够考出的：他是大畫家王原祁的五世孫，常州著名文人張惠言兄弟張琦的女壻，琦字宛鄰，本書便是丈人替他刻的了。他的夫人是號稱昆陵四女當中量小的一個，呌張紈英（若綺）。他的幾個女兒，王采蘋（澗香）采藥，采藻，采芹，都能詩，以采蘋最有名，稱咸同中閨媛一大手筆。張紈英王采蘋母女，近來談婦女文學的，都還有得說及，但是她們的丈夫或父親，却沒有這幸運，反湮晦不甚為人所知，雖然還留下一本東海記。</p>
<p>譚正璧中國文學大辭典張紈英條，云王曦早卒。曦作東海記是在道光五年，道光十一年刻成時，似仍在世，否則序跋中，必有說起。包世臣道先九年的序，有「季旭世家子，異日出而臨民」的話，其時他年事好像還輕，也不曾得到科第。紈英的降生，最早當在嘉慶四五年（因為她第三個姊姊綸英生於嘉慶三年）他們且已生下了四個女孩，假定夫婦同庚或相差不遠的話，大概王曦死時，總在三十五歲以後，不能說是很早的了。王采蘋的境遇，也極慘淡，據說她的丈夫亦是早卒。</p>
<p>東海記是郯城令周履端囑託王曦做的。周氏陽湖人，大概他們是因張家而來的交往。在王唱之前，本已有山陰陳某的一本東海記傳奇，見包序周跋及自序。今不知尙有傳本否？他們都晚這一本「未為得實」，或「不足聳動觀感」，自然是抬高王曦的說法。包序中又說陳作：「顧雜以近世之法，又其文不辭」，照語意看來，也許不是南北曲，而是皮畫劇本，亦未可定？</p>
<p>關於以東海孝婦為題材的戲曲，早在元劇裏，巳經王實甫，梁進之，王仲元三人都有同名的一本</p>
<p>東海郡于公高鬥</p>
<p>不幸這三種全佚，竟未有一本流傳，致我們不能揣知其內容怎樣？但依題名的昭示，顯然都是以决獄的能吏于公為主體叙寫的，主角似幷非孝婦。關漢卿有一本</p>
<p>感天動地竇娥寃</p>
<p>今存於元曲選中。關氏是元劇作家之始，故竇娥寃的時代，當在幾本于公高門之前。這雖不是寫的東海孝婦事，實是頗受這故事的影響而另行製作的。在第三折一煞裏，有幾句曲文道：「做什麼三年不見甘霖降，也只為東海曾經孝婦寃，如今輪到你山陽縣。」第四折寳天章曾對州官詳述：「昔日漢朝，有一孝婦，守寡，其姑自縊身死，其姑女吿孝婦殺姑，東海太守將孝婦斬了。只為一婦含寃，致令三年不雨。後于公治獄，彷彿見孝婦抱卷哭於廳前，于公將文卷改正，親祭孝婦之墓，天乃大雨。今日你楚州大旱，豈不與此事相類。」人末了詞云：「莫道我念亡女興他减罪消愆，也只可憐見楚州那大旱三年；昔于公曾表白東海孝婦，果然是感召得靈爾如泉。」一再援引，這些都可以看出關氏的有意影用東海孝婦事為粉本。孝婦抱卷哭於廳前一節，他書似幷無說及，恰為寳天章刷卷，寳娥現魂的塲面所依據。我們更拿漢書，搜神記，太平御覽等書記的孝婦事，來和竇娥寃比較，將他類似各點摘列如下：</p>
<p>東海孝婦</p>
<p>地點今山東鄭城</p>
<p>少寡</p>
<p>以姑縊死有</p>
<p>殺姑的嫌疑</p>
<p>誣服就刑</p>
<p>自誓無罪</p>
<p>血上旛竿</p>
<p>五月下雪</p>
<p>死後枯旱三年</p>
<p>祭塚表墓後雨</p>
<p>竇娥</p>
<p>地點今江蘇</p>
<p>淮安（距離不遠）</p>
<p>少寡</p>
<p>以張驢兒父</p>
<p>毒死有謀害的嫌疑</p>
<p>誣服就刑</p>
<p>自誓無罪</p>
<p>血飛旗槍白練</p>
<p>六月下雪</p>
<p>死後大旱三年</p>
<p>雪寃後雨</p>
<p>故竇娥的故事，正是東海孝婦事的改造和衍化。孝婦的本事，在漢書最初的記載，原很直率單簡，到了干寳等以後，已有逐漸蟺變的痕踪，綠增出血上旛竿等節目。大概到了金元，更有所傳翼，如抱卷哭於廳前是。在關氏的結搆裏，便又添出若干枝葉，若干人物來；把殺姑改成殺一個外人，情節羅得繁複，張驢兒賽盧醫等，紛紛的出塲了。本底子的重要人物于公，則幾於消失，彷彿部分化身為實大章，做了女主人公生身之父。這樣，以于公為中心的，遂移轉到以悲劇的主演人自己為中心。故事旣較活躍，更見抒寫的力量。後來葉憲祖袁于令輩的金鎖記，那是根據了竇娥寃再改編的，內容又有了大的變化：張驢兒的父親，換成了母親，竇娥的丈夫蔡昌宗會並未死亡，而寳娥終因六月降雪，救了她千鈞一髮的性命；結果是大團圓，失去了悲劇的氣分。現在皮黃裏的六月雪，是從金鎖記取材的，還沒有什麽歧異。至於忠實於本事，有如從于公高門一系下來的，則有這裏所說的東海記。</p>
<p>關漢卿的竇娥創造出來之後，每每就有拿來和東海孝婦並論·或混作一談的情形。鄭黃縣志以孝婦姓竇氏，（據王曦自序）或竟逕稱竇娥，（見孫星衍重修孝婦廟碑記）孫氏和陸繼輅都以為就是受了「觀優」和「元人詞曲」的附會。包世臣也說：「世所傳六月霉傳奇，或借孝婦為言」，可見東海孝婦和竇娥差不多已將融成一體了。孝婦本姓周，父嫁周姓，亦事所或有；必狃於同姓不婚之戒，以為孝婦之玷，强辯其非，劇中單稱靑姐，而不著姓，殊覺未免迂腐也。</p>
<p>王作共十六齣。因忠實於本事，故大抵完全根據上述漢書搜神記太平御覽等記載舖排，，除掉「冥讀」一齣，報復陷孝婦於罪的問官，是不必要的蛇足外，郤無甚變動增飾之處。張琦跋云：「與云亭淸容相伯仲，而得意處直逼臨川矣」，力加贊揚，標榜女夫，固可如是云云，總覺太過譽了點。然持與諸庸下的淸人傳奇相較，自尙不惡，如第十齣「夢感」，寫小姑的悔恨心理；第十一齣「報旱」，對官府的諷刺，都還很値得一讀的。</p>

<p>— 德國施托漢著陳隱之譯</p>
<p>娜麗把她的手抽回去，我們便帶點拘束神態默默無言地並步走向那條街上去，她的家便在這條街底盡頭。當我們走到街旁那個宮邸花園大門時候，街上有一羣人迎面走來，從他們的高聲說話裏，我認出有幾個是我的最荒膺學友。我們不知不覺便把腳步停止了。</p>
<p>「我們從花園穿過去吧！」我說。</p>
<p>「那太遠了！」</p>
<p>「也遠不了好多！」</p>
<p>我們傳穿過大門走上一條寬闊道路，這路在兩旁荊棘短來時之中通向一個為標樹歎子所遮蔽的蔭道去。</p>
<p>這裏，在短垣這面或那面，祇有舉國了的團圓，沒有樹，因此歸來的黑暗幷不會害得我看不見在我身旁走着的小姑娘。她現在，在這幽靜的地方，果眞到我身邊來了。</p>
<p>除了我們以外，似乎沒有一個人在道古舊的公聞裏，園裏靜得很，我們在沙上行走的每一步聲音，都可聽得出來。</p>
<p>「你不願意握着我的手麽？」我問。</p>
<p>她搖搖頭。</p>
<p>「為甚麽不呢？」</p>
<p>「不！——怕有人來的。」</p>
<p>我們來到成了穹臨形的桃櫸樹蔭道了。</p>
<p>這裏暗黑得很，因為兩旁不遠的地方都有這類的蔭道，而蔭道間的草地又佈滿了黑體號的陰影。我祇曉得娜麗在我身邊走着，因為我聽見她的呼吸和輕微的步聲，但我看不見她。此時我忽然想起：我今天下午是為捕捉蝴蝶而出門來的。</p>
<p>「現在你給我捕捉到了，」我說；黑暗壯了我的胆子，我便把她那垂下的手抓住幷緊緊地握着。</p>
<p>她讓我握着手；但我覺得她顫抖起來，我的小孩子的心也跳到咽喉上來了。</p>
<p>我們便道樣慢慢走着。</p>

<p>— 高植</p>
<p>太陽偏西了，七月初的熱氣漸漸减少，從窗口吹進來的風使人生了輕快之感。漸漸地黃昏來到了。</p>
<p>白天的喧囂暫時减少，弄堂裏的人聲也少了。天空却熱鬧起來，紅霞，金黃色的護，反着强光的白雲緩緩移動着，靑天高遠碧澄澄的，都市的屋頂遮往了落日，但夕陽無限好的光風在我依在窗邊時深深地感覺到。</p>
<p>我終於帶着輕輕的倦意坐到靠背椅裏，慵慵地靠着，看被風吹動的字屏，微微搖蕩，屏脚的橫木撞在牆上，作着輕脆的聲音。我默默地凝視着淡黃色的牆，看黃昏漸漸在屏條的字上籠罩着濃厚的暗色，暗色的影子從牆頂牆脚和房角湧了出來，如埋伏的兵，漸漸從四周向房中作包圍的形式而伸展着。</p>
<p>我燃着蠟燭，燭光在微風中搖曳，黃色的火焰在深暮的暗色中無力地寂寞地存在着。房裏安靜，空廓，燭的黃色火燄和房角裏衝出的黑暗在作着靜穆的爭鬥，彼此衝突着，對抗着。</p>
<p>我看着輕輕擺動的屏條上的字，一度被黃昏後的暗色所籠罩的字又被黃色的燭光照明亮了一點，但屏條上的字仍然是不很分明，我感覺到還些字裏的朋友的精神是活在紙上的。</p>
<p>我沉默着，不想什麼，眼睛是睜着的，心却睡着了。我存在半醒的感覺中。偶然地，淡淡地，想起十五六年前跟亡父讀書時的情形，草芯的紅蠟燭的黃燄搖擺着，在靜穆中我斷續地跟着背誦「中庸」文注的聲音，顯得很沉寂似的，父親偶而發出的話聲也是很寂靜的。</p>
<p>這淡然的影子又飛去了，我的心乃空廓得如初夜的天空。屋裏沒有一點聲音，我彷彿忘了自已的存在。</p>
<p>初夜的氣吹進了窗子，屋角顯得更黑暗，黃色的燭燄也顯得更加明亮。眼看着字屏，心却睡得更熟了。</p>
<p>在初夜的搖曳的燭光中我靜坐着，漸漸地我的眼皮也重了。窗外都市的鬧聲隨着映在天空中的霓虹燈光一道在天空中波動着。夜色漸深沉。……</p>

<p>「喉嚨不舒服，你也不檢査檢查就算了麼？」</p>
<p>「檢査？」這位還沒有戴上方帽子的醫學士有些老羞成怒了。「你囉嗦什麽，相信就是了。檢查，檢査要特別掛號！」用鼻子哼了一聲，好像這句話就可以止住別人的嘴。</p>
<p>「你說沒有毛病，孩子瘦下好多天了，沒有毛病就瘦麽？」妻不服氣，接着說。「你用特別掛號來嚇人哪，特別掛號也不是掛不起的，可是犯不上請你這樣的高手！」</p>
<p>醫學士有些急了，因為別的看病的人都在緊釘釘注視着他，他的臉上急出汗珠子來。他拍了一下桌子：</p>
<p>「去，快去，別在道裏發神經病，到神經病醫院去療治罷。」</p>
<p>我可老大不高興，妻的話雖然說的過火，但是並沒有錯！而且，一羣看病人裏面恐怕只有她一個人敢於說出口，別人，雖然內心裏憤憤不平，當面還要管他呌幾聲「先生」，為的要求他一點歡心，好加細一點看毛病。醫生看病本該鄭重其事的才對，這樣草草率率的看，還不講道理，實在失去救人的本旨。我也替妻抱不平。接下去說：</p>
<p>「先生，且莫生氣吧，沒有戰過方帽子，火氣太盛了。你別看不起這些病人，沒有這些病人來看病，請問你將來可指望什麼生活？這些人是你的主顧啊，你賣的是貨色，不是擺架子發脾氣。」</p>
<p>他更氣，跳起來，甩動着白衫袖，要捉我，意思要把我拖出去，可是當他眞捉到我的肩膀時，倒讓我把他摔了一下，險些摔個根斗。看護嚇慌神，但她還是替院裏人說話：</p>
<p>「作什麼？你要打人？報吿院長」</p>
<p>她按着鈴子，鈴子噹噹噹的響。</p>
<p>我一點也不在意，他們這是在要把戲，我明白，只可惜我不怕。</p>
<p>「報吿院長？」我心平氣和地說。「這些看病人就是我的證人！到底誰先動手？動手，你們能動得過我？在學校裏我作過運動員，我練過拳，你們再添十個八個也不是對手！你們能治病，可治不去別人的氣力！院長麽？我倒認得，他來更好，省得我再去找他報吿你們的劣跡！我等在這裏，你們辦罷。」我這種近於流氓無賴的行徑，想不到倒嚇住了兩個逞兇的人，最後，還是那未來的醫學士上來陪了禮。</p>
<p>我們並不是要他陪禮就算了，實在痛恨他們的蠻橫！我們總覺得他們對待病人太不客氣，病，本是到院裏去治病，反面會因此招到一身火氣。</p>
<p>「預備下午特別掛號麽？」</p>
<p>出了醫院，妻問詢着我。</p>
<p>「生氣是生氣，看病是看病，只有等下午了。」我回答着，難過得很。「我們能掛起特別號的固然很好，別的掛不起特別號的人又怎樣呢？不是還要受他們的凌侮麽？」</p>
<p>「希望人人少生病。」</p>
<p>「那你還不如希望醫生們多裝出一點和氣的面孔。」</p>
<p>晚上，妻眼看孩子的病症還不見好，抓住我的手笑着說：</p>
<p>「我去學醫好不好？」</p>

<h3 id="c231">艾登的「憑天命」 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 方殷</p>
<p>記不起在什麼地方聽人說過：今年是「旅行外交年」。這句話似乎很不錯，今年各國的外交活動的確很有些採取這種旅行外交的趨勢，像麥唐納之訪意，西門艾登之訪德波俄，賴伐爾之聘問莫斯科……這些外交人物的長途跋涉，確是數年來所不常見到的事。反之，會議外交在今年就特別顯得冷落，國聯會所也幾乎可以門前堪羅雀了。</p>
<p>艾登這位翩翩公子，是「旅行外交年」中最活躍的一員，他走過的路也特別比別人來得長遠些，剛從柏林歸來，繼之又往華沙，莫斯科去，最近，又復奉命去巴黎和羅馬旅行了，而且，還將要重度至柏林去唔希特拉呢。</p>
<p>照理，這位翩翩年少的「旅行外交家」，在這次英國內閣的更迭中，最應該獲得外交大臣這一席位的，但是結果是因爲年紀和經驗的關係而落選了。這樣，眞使我們替這位翩翩公子爲之悔氣。</p>
<p>但是，這還沒有什麼要緊，「來日方長」，我們就拭目以待他的來日吧！因之，我們非得看看他在新閣成立後的外交活動不可。</p>
<p>現在，他居然又爲意阿事件而至羅馬去，和黑衣宰相慕沙里尼討價還價的在商量着東菲的交易了。結果呢？天曉得！</p>
<p>不過，從他的談話中，倒也未甞不透露了一些兒，然而最神秘的，還在於他說了這樣的話：「此行結果」，「一切均當憑天命而已」。這個「憑天命」，似乎已經輕輕隱示着如許苦衷和困難了。</p>
<p>當意大利正在緊急的佈置軍事的現在，這「憑天命」三字倒很容易洩出一些火藥氣味來的，可是這並不止是艾登旅行的倒霉，我想最大的倒霉還在於貧弱的阿北西尼亞這個國家。</p>
<p>現在，艾登復商得了法總理兼外交部長賴伐爾的同意：「不阻英德解决局　了。那麼，艾登的重度到柏林之行，想來總該來得順利一點，如果不至又是一切「憑天命」的話，說不定倒會給希特拉的鐵臂拉一拉他，指向東望積極的用火藥氣來幹一次「人爲的」「解决」呢！</p>
<p>由於這，倒使我們想起那第一次大戰前的外交旅行來了。</p>
<h3 id="c232">眼的分類 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 容</p>
<p>從前有一次害了眼病，到一個專門眼科醫生那裏去治療，診視一過之後，據說是不甚要緊，心纔放鬆下來，同時在他壁問，看到了許多希奇古怪的眼睛掛圖，他指着講解給我聽，告訴我人們的眼睛共分若干種類，他的話是那樣的多，而那些構圖又是那樣繁複，以致我完全記不清楚；等到出了大門，早已把他的話忘了個干干凈凈，只有那些紅的，紫的，藍的，黃的斑爛顏色，依舊不曾從眼府逝去，因而在腦中留下一個模糊的印象。</p>
<p>從那以後，我就知道人類生理構造原不如我們歷來所想像的那麼簡單，那麼千篇一律，僅就極細微的眼睛一物而論吧，就可分爲若干種類，而這却是我們在日常生活中所忽略了的。</p>
<p>後來把我這意思告訴了一個友人，他聽了不禁大笑起來，說我未免太書獃氣了，說眼睛只有兩種可分，一種是中國人的黑眼睛，另一種是西洋人的碧藍眼睛，這是千眞萬確不容否認的分法，此外立了許多名目，盡了許多構圖，都是多餘的能力浪費，都是無聊的庸人自擾。我被他駁得無話可說，因爲他的話也不是沒有相當理由，也就默認了下來。</p>
<p>一件看似模糊的事情未甞不可尋出一條清楚的跡象，就拿他的話來說吧，我們不是已經從那武斷式的論證中發現了一個區分的標準來了嗎？「顏色」！就是這古怪的東西！一種是黑的，另一種是碧藍的，還有比這再清楚，再明晰，再合理的事實嗎？一個最普通，最淺顯，而爲人所共知的事，我偏不信，卻要去相信那眼科醫生的胡謅，眞像他所說的那樣「庸人自擾」了，想到這裏，不禁自己啞然失笑起來。</p>
<p>此後我便永遠保存着這種信念，處在這華洋雜處的大都會裏，給我實驗的機會也眞多，看了些西洋人，又看了些中國人和日本人，把我的意思弄得更其强固起來。眼睛有兩種：一種是黑的，一種是碧藍的；這是和一加一等於二那樣的眞理，這是不折不扣的現實！</p>
<p>可是等我在這人海中混跡了幾年之後，我的意念開始發生動搖了，我漸漸地對自己懷疑起了，因爲人類的眼睛，雖然可以分類，但那分類却絕不如我所想像的那樣簡單，單單憑藉着眼球的表面的顏色而加以觀察，那麼這論斷也就未免失之膚淺與錯誤。不是嗎？爲什麼在我這短短的涉世經驗中，竟發現了許多絕不能單純地用黑與碧藍來形容的眼睛呢？</p>
<p>人的意志也許可因涉世的緣故而一天比一天沉落，可是思想却一天比一天明白了，在不斷的觀察中，我發現了一個可以挼爲眼睛分類的標準，只有這標準纔是最可靠的，這就是：青眼與白眼。</p>
<p>說是青眼與白眼，其實並不是表面上顏色的區別，這其間的差異，這很可從一個人的神情態度上觀察出來。譬如，這是一個既無地位，又無財產，更無聲望的窮小子，那麼無論你走到什麼地方，你都可以看到白眼，而這種觀察却並不是由於你的色盲。反之，你是一個有地位，有財產，有聲望的達官富紳，巨商名流時，那麼無論你走到那裏，向你投射過來的全是青眼。在你下面的人奉承你，在你上面的人獎飾你，女人對你表示好感，同事向你客客氣氣，圍繞在你四週的就全是這種熙和的春風，你絕想不到自己是生在一個冷酷寡情的宇宙裏。有時一個人在一生中可以兼遇到這兩種眼睛，破落戶是先看青眼後看白眼，暴發戶是先看白眼後看青眼。同時人類也並不是有一種是白眼，而另一種是青眼的，每一個人可以同時具備這兩種眼睛，以備見着地位，財產，聲望不同的人時可以分別拿出對付。而且這種分法是超越了古今中外的範疇，橫亙於我們社會生活之核心的，所以是最恰當的分法。不信嗎？請你到十字街頭去試試看！</p>
<p>我想以後的生理學教科書中「眼部」的一章都該加上一句：「眼，分青白二種，各依對象人物之經濟地位而變化。」</p>
<h3 id="c233">老船主 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 新野</p>
<p>夥計們將船攏了岸，繫定了纜索，等乘客全從蹺板上走上了碼頭；於是大家都忙碌地起貨物，老船主却坐在後梢火艙面上，倚着那支舵牙抽旱烟去了。</p>
<p>船上是顯得十分地忙亂，起貨，掃艙，落蓬，倒檣，搭棚，啟舵，蓋平基等，還有一個小夥計是在預備燒晚飯。</p>
<p>「今朝天氣恐怕靠不住，我看還是</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>先把油布放開了吧」！老船主望望天，看見天空中已經糊上了一層深灰色的雲版，也就意識到這是將要下雨的徵兆了。</p>
<p>這條港在從是很曾熱鬧過的，譬如老船主在年靑的時候，他還在一隻客貨船上當一名攔頭夥計，後來才陞了老大：那時這條港里總常常有十多條客貨船停泊着的。可是現在却冷落得像死了一般了。除了這隻破船還時常在這裏出進外，差不多沒有船隻會走進這條港裏來灣一灣的。况且那條港離開鎭市約莫有一哩多路遠，兩岸全是土山，港畔有一條呢路，要是下了雨的當兒是非常濘滑的，但是老船主自家兒沒有碼頭，所以祇好在這裏靠岸。港稍有一隻破亭子，那隻船便也寂寞地在那兒停靠了下來。</p>
<p>天是漸漸地黑下來了，船裏那盞桅燈已點上了一支火，那昏黃無力的燈光下，他們圍坐在一起，開始在吃夜飯了。</p>
<p>下雨了；蓬布上發出了一種淸脆而節拍的聲音，這聲音在這幽靜的夜裏織奏出了撼人心弦的調子。</p>
<p>「桅窗間去關了吧；可不是？我料早到今天晚上要下雨的」！老船主一碗飯捧在手裏，但他却頓時止住了正在扒飯的筷，指着一個小夥計這樣說。</p>
<p>這一晚老船主睡在臥艙裏，無論如何總睡不着：想想自家兒除了這條破船外，一身之外竟沒有長物！他如今是五十八歲的人了，然而他四十年的生活是在水面上度過的，並且他現在已是一個沒有了家鄉的，孤獨的飄泊老人了。他記得五年前的這時還有一個破落的家，老婆雖然死了已經將近十年，可是他有一個兒子也要二十歲快了；雖則有了這樣大的孩子，還不能馬上使他安息，但是至少也能够替他一分力的，誰知道老天不生眼睛，他的唯一的一個兒子也竟然在前年的夏天患霍亂而死了！他現在依靠了這條破船過日子，今天東，明天西，一年三百六十天在水面上飄流：然而這條船恰恰正像他一樣老邁而疲憊得有些行走不動了。並且，因為年久失修的緣故，所以不但油漆已經剝蝕光，而有許多地方已在滲水了，一扇蓬布也破得遮不牢風；如果航行在較遼闊點的河面上，只要一遇風波，那就有些意外危險的。不過他自己也明白這個，所以他總常常這樣說：</p>
<p>「這隻船實在舊得可憐了，再要不修是不能拖下去啦！但是近來的生意又這樣的淸，開一趟船，連了開火倉還不够，那裏上得起岸呢？像這隻船要是上一起岸，我想至少也得要四五百塊錢的……！」他這樣的話說了總要三四年了，而且說過也不知有幾百回了；但是直到今日還是沒有上過一回岸。莫說上岸吧，甚至連揩水油都沒有給它揩過。</p>
<p>他想想有些悲哀，眼角裏也不覺有些兒水汪汪了；想到他不久的將來也會同這隻破船一同地沉到水底下去的！</p>
<p>「漏！漏！船底裏在進水了」！他正在繼續地想，却被一種驚恐的呼聲打斷了。</p>
<p>「在那裏」？他雖然明白這隻船各處都己有了漏洞，但還是裏這樣問一句。</p>
<p>「貨艙裏，大艙裏全有水啦」！</p>
<p>「桅艙裏，來梢裏也在漏啦」！</p>
<p>「怎麼辦」！他己經艙裏起來，聽得雨聲仍在蓬布上克克克的饗着，平基上全給漏濕了。望望幾處艙底的水，泊泊地古向裏面流；他束手無策的站在那裏，看着水越冒越多，儘在艙底下積深起來。</p>
<p>「怎麼辦」？他搓着手，在艙面上打了幾個轉回，又抓抓頭髪，終於想不出個補救的辦法！</p>
<p>夥計們却都忙着用東西去堵，但是漏洞太多，這樣那裏能够堵得住呢。</p>
<h3 id="c234">明嫂的故事 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 達雲</p>
<p>魚肚白的天色，行雲慢慢地飛着，半圓的月亮懸在中天，迷迷離離的，沒有光彩，世界好像是尙在靜止的狀態中。</p>
<p>灶披間是這麽的昏暗，黑黝黝的，沒有半點生氣。這時，明嫂偷偷地從扶梯上沙沙地下來走，經過灶披間，扭亮了電燈，閃閃的低度的紅色電光，射着她的蒼黃而又瘦削的臉龐，很淸楚的瞧出兩隻小山峯似的突出的顴骨，和那金魚眼似的一對浮而路眸子她的頭髮是零亂的，像一堆蓬草蓋覆在頭頂上，不充足的睡眼使她這對浮露的大眼睛表現着懶懶的疲倦。</p>
<p>當她感到工作繁忙，越做越不開交的時候，她時常暗地裏背着人流淚，嘆氣，而怨着自家的不辰的命運。</p>
<p>明嫂沒有嫁到胡家來的時候，因為家裏姊妹們太多的緣故，而自己又生成一副不大伶俐的口舌，不善逢迎長輩，因此時常不得長輩的歡心，於是家裏人是都對處處存着歧視，幸而她對於世事都能够看得開，不存介在懷裏，所以，絲毫沒有覺得被人們歧視的苦惱。然而，她的情性雖則漠視一切，但她自從出娘胎便不大歡喜笑，這正是象徵着她她走上了悲苦的世界來了。</p>
<p>當她母親未產下她以前，據說家裏的一切都很順利的。可是，自從她降臨到這世界上那年，壯健的母親便生了一塲大病，躺在床上過着十幾天的輾轉苦楚的生活，這使她疑惑到明嫂的不是，求神問卜，也都說是明嫂的「八字」太硬，不會蔭福父母。那年又適逢水災，村前的堤防，給洪流衝潰了，村前後的一望無際的稻田，頓成一片洪濤，村上人都戚到天災臨頭，誰也愁眉不展地憂心着。在這憂悶的氛氣裏，她幾乎成為全家埋怨的的，像犯人似的給人們打，罵，奚落，出出悶氣，誰也不會同情她，憐情她！</p>
<p>到了明嫂長大了的時候，覺得自家的姊妹們合不來。她總是整天地獨自個兒做着家裏的粗細的雜務，空閒時便獨個兒踽踽地走到田賸上，坐在大樹下，呆望着業縫裏的藍納悶。遠遠地聽到父親習慣的咯咯的咳嗽，她便驀然地站起來，跑回家去，那古老的大樹，就是她兒時唯一的朋友，和諧的伴侶，她對於一切好像沒有更多的企求。</p>
<p>十八歲那年，父母總算完了他的責任，把她配給村上的明哥，那時她憧憬着出嫁後過着新環境的幸福的生活，和明哥的伶俐，能幹，這愉快的憧憬，在她的腦際迥旋着，一直到她嫁到明哥的家裏。</p>
<p>然而明哥却沒有如她的理想中的伶俐，能幹，因為他從小就受了父母的溺愛，和無微不至地珍護，把他弄成一個痴人。</p>
<p>明嫂旣感到了丈夫的缺陷，她的一切的新的希望都成為鏡花水月，生活的磨難比在家裏更為繁重，她的壑達的情性已漸漸地含着悲鬱的氣分了，而且現在她又是一個有着三個兒女的母親，她强健的身體給一斧一斧的剝削殆盡，她沒有從前一般的獃氣，她己充分地認識了悲哀了。</p>
<p>當她瞧見床上的兒女們睡得正酣的時候，她偷偷地下床上，沙沙地走下扶悌，預備做她磨不盡的工作。她疲憊的眼睛，望着窗外迷離的月亮，和灰色的天空裏慢慢的行雲出神，此外，一切都靜穆穆的，世界好像睡着。</p>

<p>— 朱芩</p>
<p>車吐若黑姻突從七時十五分開出，西支車站在晨陽的溫意裏遠去了！我站在窗口，回頭瞥視那煩熱的檳城，是變成了一片淸澈而又模糊的超實在的世界，在這世界裏只留得一副黑眼睛了！在我眼前映出了深沉的光芒。我威到一陣歡喜，也不知還是恨惘，我是和檳城小別了。</p>
<p>我愛好旅行，旋行給與我不單是調換那煩悶不潔的空氣，牠是積極地會使得我的身心多得一種壯堅的感受；自然的偉大，人類的靈戚，一上火車，我嗅着那煤烟的氣息，我威到一種無可宣說的歡喜，己經是許多日子，我好像關閉在竹籠裏的小鳥，不得自由飛翔於我所想望的世界。</p>
<p>一踏上火車，令我欣喜與興奮的，還不單是那新的環境將要到來，還有是那一個回憶的綫索是如此溫情地又展現在我眼前了！呵！這西支車站曾經堆積有我幾多的悲愁與喜愉的感覺啊！現在我是第三次和它小別。</p>
<p>直到火車開出，八個人坐位的車廂空空的終只有我一人，我覺得一種像在自已寓居似的那樣安靜，但，又略威到一點沒有旅伴的寞寂！我把自已的箱子安放在行李欄上，還有那隨手携帶的小紙傘，我對它注視了好久，牠們現在是我這短短的旅程中唯一的親切伴侶了！</p>
<p>火車迅速地開着，窗外飛過的是一些檳城東郊的野景，一些樹木掩映着一些高大的樓房，最引住我的目力的，是從樹影裏透出的大大的白字「古勃」酒的廣告牌，人的感覺眞奇怪，現在這些白字也會使我感到一些親切之味，引起我對檳城一些戀念的述想，我兩眼望着窗外簡直忍制不住我自已的暗笑。</p>
<p>「這裏有坐位嗎？小姐：」一句突然的星加坡語把我驚醒了，我回頭一看是一位本土的年靑姑娘立在車廂門口，笑容可掬地問：「對不起！小姐。」</p>
<p>「有的，有的，你請自已的便，假使你願意到這車廂裏來。」我回答，用本士語。</p>
<p>「好我謝謝你！」她說完魷轉身去，不二分鐘工夫，便把她的手提箱帶了過來，坐了對面窗邊的一個坐位。她謹愼而小心地把小皮箱放在靠窗，頭倚住了窗板，二眼就閉了起來，當然，我敢相信她决不是想睡，她是為遮掩她幻想的秘轉而這樣的。我想。</p>
<p>「你到什麽地方去？小姐。」她忽地張開二眼問了我，我全然沒有預備她會同我攀談的，雖然本土人最歡喜與陌生人閒談，所以這一句十分容易回答的談竟也會使我窘了起來。</p>
<p>「你到坡力嗎？你應該去一次，那邊的風景眞不壞！」她又接着說。</p>
<p>「我是到白加邨去，」我說：「你是到吉隆嗎？」</p>
<p>「不，我是去納正河的，還要換公共汽車呢，去年我會到坡力去玩的，也只須二小時的路程好了。」</p>
<p>這中覇沉默了，但，片刻的交談，己使我的心田感到熱活起來，我們在沉默問體味了人生最舒洽的一剎那，這時各人都望着窗外，原來窗外飄起雨來了！</p>

<p>— 虞</p>
<p>電影是近代科學發明的一大奇蹟。除了娛樂之外。兼有教育的功能。世界上電影事業發達的。要算美國。他的製造大本營在好萊無情。這差不多是盡人皆知的。除了美國之外。要推英國和德國。蘇俄雖很努於這種新興事業。若要和英美比較。就很遠了。電影藝術除能陶冶情感。增加人生興趣之外。對於科學商業的供獻。也不可以忽視的。現在單拿他與汽車事業的關係說一說。就可以明瞭電影和商業的重要了。</p>
<p>據英國卡佛爾影片公司經理洛夫氏的觀察。實事影片的效用大致可分為三點。（一）促進商品的銷售。一種商品在行銷之先。一定要獲得買眾和銷售商對於這種商品的確切明瞭與信仰。如果銷售員對買眾說明商品製造的經過。機械和工廠情形。單憑口講是沒有用的。在機器和工廠不能跟了銷售員跑的困難情形之下。唯一的方法祇能借重影片了。（二）教導經銷商和推銷員。使他們確切明瞭商品的生產經過。和怎樣去找尋銷售市塲。對付各種買客。（三）作業務上的一般推進。維持商品的信用和名聲。在一種新出品上市的時候。作為普遍的宣傳</p>
<p>汽車的製造情形。駕駛的便易舒適。和各種改良地方。都能利用銀幕來映演於大眾之前。引起和提醒他們的注意。因此而銷數增進的。為例甚多。像福特汽車公司便是一個好例子。他們利用了電影。在已往的一二年中。所銷的車輛在七五，〇〇〇和一〇〇，〇〇〇輛之間。「鋼鐵贊」一片在支加哥百年進步展覽會中。引起大眾的注意和欣賞。最近一張片子。名叫「這三十年來」，本事出自名小說家費爾史湯的手。大為銷售商及公眾的歡迎。這張片曾獲得影評人的好評。又為美國電片生產商及銷售商預觀委員會選為是月七大佳片中之一。</p>
<p>古特立區的胎輪也借重了電影而得暢銷。在一九三四年時。銷數較之一九三三年增加了美金一、〇〇〇、〇〇〇元。公司中的員司都說這是受電影宣傳之賜。因為銷售商看了這種影片之後。便能設法獲得更大的銷路。和對於顧客更滿意的服務。著名的聖開司脫橘子。谷名花旗橘子。他每年的銷路本來已經不錯。自從加利福尼亞菓商公所利用電影來推銷之後。橋港地方的菒商職工。看了他們這張「合夥為利」的影片之後。在十天之中銷去了三列半的橘子。比了往昔增加了一倍。在汽車事業中心點的底特羅各菓店中。一星期內銷去橘子和檸檬飲品三二、〇〇〇件。勃發洛一家公司從每星期二百四十六箱增加到每星期一千二百零三箱。紐約羅吉司脫各菓店的營業。所增約百分之二百。影片對於銷售的力量。真不小呀。</p>
<p>美國各汽車公司所出的實業影片。為數很多。較著的為福特公司的「鋼鐵贊。」奧笛華出品。「這三十年中。」卡拉佛爾出品。納許公司有一張。勃頓華姆士出品。吉特異一張。為哈恩臺出品。通用公司的雪佛蘭一張。哈恩臺出品。哇爾特斯麻別爾一張。出品者同。古特立區兩張多是卡拉佛爾出口。此外係飛休車身公司。強賓發火塞。赫特森。克雷斯勒等。多有各種不同的影片。</p>
<p>製作良好的實業影片。至少要給幾十萬至一百萬人觀看。而所獲得的效果。都沒有錯誤的。上面所說的福特「這三十年中」一片。據估計看過的人至少在一〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇左右。因為這張牌子不僅在支加哥的百年進步展覽中映演。就是普通的電影院裏也常開映的。</p>
<p>美國的實業影片製造商都是經騐豐富的專家。是好萊塢的正宗所以製片時的導演佈景配光收音等一筆不敬。而良好的實業影片又須有完美的腳本。係福特的「這三十年中」便是出於文學家之手。無怪其能吸引最多數的大眾了。現在的實業影片較了以前進步多多。決不是一張僅僅紀錄工廠工作情形的片子。一定要能抓住觀眾的心理。引起他們的欣賞。方能達到最後所希望的目的哩。</p>
<h3 id="c244">馬迪汽車公司舉行十五週年紀念 <a href="#c244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>特刋行精美紀念冊</p>
<p>愛多亞路四川路轉角美商馬迪汽車公司。以本年為該公司創業十五週紀念。特刋行精美小冊。以誌慶祝。按於此十五年間。大小汽車行家之經改組或閉歇者。殆已指不勝屈。惟馬迪汽車公司。自距今十五年前。開始草創以來。特序進展。日臻發達。今已一躍而為中國汽車經售商中之一巨孹。當初開辦較馬迪為早。迄今依然存在之汽車公司。綜計僅尚餘兩家耳。</p>
<p>馬迪公司。素以組織健全。服務週到。並富於熱忱毅力。與勇往邁進精神。為一般人所稱道。故凡有裨於中國汽車界人士之一切運動。該公司率先參加。且莫不竭全力以從事。計其出色當行。為世人公認。確以馬迪為第一者。約有下列多端。</p>
<p>一·首先設立「屋內」汽油站於愛多亞路四川路轉角。自後同業逐繼起裝設。竟相仿效。</p>
<p>二·首先建築大樣子間。陳列客車及運貨車。現該建築（愛多亞路四川路轉角）仍為中國境內最大之樣子間。計可陳列大汽車二十二輛。</p>
<p>三·首先築造鋸齒式日光房屋。為多年來中國境內最大之汽車修理部。自後同樣結構之建築物多所。蓋卽皆照樣仿造者。</p>
<p>四·中國境內之有汽車修理坑。自馬迪始。</p>
<p>五·首先裝運水壓升降及高壓潤滑機來華應用。</p>
<p>六·上海之有特別構造並裝配起重機之汽車修理專車。自馬迪始。</p>
<p>七·首先訂定分期付款辦法。並登報廣告。（其標語為旣可分期付款。何必徒步。）</p>
<p>八·霓虹燈與汽車廣告牌子之採用。均以馬迪為第一。該公司至今尚擁有霓虹燈汽車牌子兩面。為中國境內之最大者。</p>
<p>九·「賣了還是服務」與「適合人人財力及用途之汽車。」兩標語。乃馬迪所最先發明。而為十年來帬相仿用者。</p>
<p>十·青島與芝罘間之汽車旅行路線。其首先出發試探並完成之者。馬迪是也。（該次旅行。費時共兩天半。嗣後公路卽沿此線造成。行旅稱便。計其哩程。尚不足六小時。）</p>
<p>十一·滬杭及南京間之汽車往返路線。其首先試探完成之者。馬迪是也。</p>
<p>十二·首先以「家庭旅行汽車」運來中國。並首先以此汽車。旅行中國各處。</p>
<p>此外以馬迪為第一者。尚有三項。惟該公司總理馬迪氏。深自謙仰。雅不欲表白於世。緣此數項。均與其本人有關也。</p>
<p>馬迪汽車公司。於一九二三年起。受任為派卡汽車公司駐華經理。於一九二四年起。受任為克雷斯勒汽車公司經理。一九二五年起。經理利華汽車。一九二七年起。經理順風牌汽車。一九二九年起。經理第沙多及霍戈運貨車。及至最近。該公司復受任為康海狄塞爾運貨車經理。並聞此項新車。不日卽可供獻於世。</p>
<p>馬迪公司營業。及於全中國。至其所營之業務。範圍殊廣。凡關於各種客車及商業運輸車之推銷保管及修理等事宜。無小包括在內。其規模之恢宏。實力之雄厚。早為人所稔知。該公司大班兼總經理為馬迪氏。副總經理為施密斯氏。至於營業部經理。則為海士林氏。馬迪氏生平關心最切之一問題。厥為如何促進中國各地良好道路之建設。關於此層。氏於過去十五年間。竭力從事。未嘗或懈。此種熱忱。蓋尤為時彥所欽佩不置者。此次該公司十五週紀念。曾有請其略述感想者。則曰。『溯自十五年前。本公司草創以來。賴諸同仁。其中多數卽為本公司之股東。竭智盡忠。毅力協助。得以漸次進展。日益發達。以躋於今日之地位。此余所深致感佩者。今後公司曁諸同仁。果能秉前此精神。繼續努力。以謀發揚光大。而共享福利。則尤為余所渴望者』。</p>
<h3 id="c245">一九三五年的格蘭亨新汽車 <a href="#c245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— 欽</p>
<p>一九三五年的汽車市塲上。充滿了大批低價的車輛。這恐怕也是因了大眾的購買力降低的緣故。所以今年的格蘭亨（Groham）新車。當然逃不出要「價廉物美」四字。新車的輪底闊計「百十一吋。機器是六汽缸式。三吋　四吋。」形式的汽缸頂。總汽缸容量共一六九·六立方吋。發動馬力計六十匹。每分鐘轉數是三千五百轉。　四門轎車的重量共二千七百磅。這輛一九三五年式的新車有無數的優點。不僅是售價上十分克己。而經常貨也很便宜。它的汽油銷耗量十分經濟。據廠家試騐後的報告。說是每加侖汽油可走二十六哩至十六哩。後者數字乃在車行每小時七十哩的速率時的計錄。一九三五式的格蘭亨汽車除此六的汽缸車以外。還有特別六汽缸。八汽缸。與超量八汽缸等式。不過它們的模型仍是一九三四年式的。祗有細瑣的地方加以改良。車身同時也改進了許多。這三種汽車的內部尺寸同去年的還是一樣。但是那低價的六汽缸車稍有不同。其內部的長度與闊度均經稍減。水箱方格改成很狹的。鑲板也十分適合於流線形。後鑲板的斜度比去年大。這些僅是外表上最顯著的改良。新車的車後地位很寬敞。預備車輪除了四門轎車是放在車外之外。都可以藏進車後的箱中。這樣可以增進車身的流線形。</p>
<p>車框是更加堅固。那X式的車框又經改善。把前部的兩腳更伸長。固定在旁樑上。然後再變向內部。同一要有橫板連結。成一K字型。堅固異常。</p>
<p>彈簧裝置。和去年的式樣無多改變。是裝在旁樑之外。前彈簧的力量是每吋一百五十二磅。後彈簧的力量是每吋一百二十磅。從偏心卷軸的測騐上。我們知道前彈簧的週期是一百。後彈簧是九十。而重量的分佈約在四十至六十之間。</p>
<p>發動機部的支持點有三處。全用軟橡皮以吸收震動。兩點是在前面。與水平而成一斜度。其餘一點是支持在傳力機的後部。汽缸的全部都用水套。汽門的四周也用水冷卻。這樣可以發動機更加耐久經用。不易損壞。</p>
<p>超　八汽缸車的動作。改進很多。與高速率時一般。這是因為改用了四臂的新鋁製進汽管的緣故。此種改變可以使發動機的原力增加。約增馬力在十匹以上。扭轉力在七磅呎以上。從化汽器上看來。這種新的進汽管需要一個更大的化汽器。那舊式的氣流向下的方法在這裏似乎不十分適宜。因為在低速率時其節制未能靈敏如常。所以在格蘭亭車上就用了司曲郎勃式的化汽器。用兩隻化汽器來供給燃料。這可使汽車在低速率時的行動。更增效力。</p>
<p>其他的優點。在超特八汽缸車上有電氣自動掣的裝置。還有鑄鐵做的車掣鼓。在普通的八汽缸與特別六的汽缸的車上均裝有司曲郎勃式的化汽器。八汽缸車上共用兩隻。特別六汽缸車上則用一隻。各種格蘭亨車上都裝有司伯式直接避震器。所以車子的行駛非常平衡。這些都是今年新車上的特點。總之。價廉兩字尤是格蘭亨新車的標識。</p>

<h3 id="e19">President Wang's Condition <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Today, the reporter visited Luo Guanglin, the attending physician of President Wang, to inquire about President Wang's condition. According to him, President Wang has been feeling discomfort in his stomach, intestines, liver, and gallbladder for several months, and he has had severe pain from time to time. An X-ray taken in May revealed gallstones. At that time, many doctors had already begun to study whether or not he should undergo surgery. After Dr. Noel's examination on the 26th of last month, it was found that the bile ducts had begun to become inflamed. Fortunately, there was no fever yet. Dr. Yi advised him to take leave for treatment immediately. President Wang believed that the country was in dire straits and it was not time to rest, so he did not follow the doctor's advice and continued to work with illness. On the evening of the 27th, he began to have a fever. On the 28th and 29th, the fever increased sharply. On the 30th, the fever reached 103 degrees, and he was dizzy all day long. After Dr. Noel's examination, it was believed that he had cholecystitis and cholangitis. If he was not treated strictly immediately, he was afraid that he would develop cholangio　abscess, which would require surgery. Because President Wang had a history of diabetes, surgery would not be easy to recover. In addition, because the liver had swollen repeatedly, its position had changed slightly, so the position of the gallbladder was also three ribs higher than that of ordinary people. This can be seen on the mountain X-ray. If surgery is performed, three ribs must be removed, which will take two and a half hours, which his body cannot withstand. Therefore, he must stop working immediately and engage in treatment to avoid the danger of surgery. Even if surgery is performed, he must first have sufficient rest due to his mental and physical condition. Therefore, he went to Shanghai with the doctor that night to check the results of the blood test. He has been addicted to chemistry. Dr. Noel has consulted with other doctors and is preparing for surgery. There was a slight turnaround on the 4th and 5th of this month. If there are no changes in the future, he can be stabilized by injection. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

In reality, the Way of Confucius possesses an inherent and indelible quality, and it cannot be augmented or diminished in the slightest by the praise or criticism of ordinary people.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Yat-sen once stated that Chinese political philosophy surpasses that of Europe and America. This so-called Chinese political philosophy largely belongs to the system of Confucian doctrines. Mr. Sun Yat-sen also repeatedly spoke of restoring China's inherent moral skills, referring to loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, peace, as well as rectifying the heart, making intentions sincere, cultivating oneself, regulating the family, governing the state, and bringing peace to the world. None of these are outside the Way of Confucius.</p>
<p>What we should learn from Confucius, let us discuss important points: (1) Learn his spirit of learning. In Confucius' time, bamboo slips and wood carvings made obtaining books extremely difficult. Moreover, they were stored in official repositories, inaccessible to anyone but the elite. Scattered among the states, they were not centrally organized, hindering future research. Confucius, coming from the common people, was able to thoroughly explore the depths of various books and sought out what he did not know, asking Hong about music, Lao Pin about rituals, and Zhengzi about government. He learned to play the zither from Shi Xiang, deleted the Book of Poetry and Book of Documents, established the Book of Rites and Book of Music, revised the Spring and Autumn Annals, and praised the Book of Changes. Because of his diligence and dedication to learning, he was able to achieve such great accomplishments. Confucius once spoke of his way of learning, saying, "I am not born with knowledge; I am one who loves antiquity and diligently seeks it." He also said, "Engrossed in study, I forget food; joyful in it, I forget my worries, unaware that old age is approaching." This fully demonstrates his profound interest in learning and his tireless spirit even in old age. Compared to those who are content with a smattering of knowledge and those who criticize recklessly without ever having read a book, the difference is immeasurable. Furthermore, he disseminated the knowledge of the official repositories to the common people and spread it to all directions. This is Confucius' achievement. Without Confucius, the development of Chinese civilization would have been delayed for many years.</p>
<p>(2) Learn Confucius' spirit of teaching. Confucius taught according to aptitude, and he taught without discrimination. Therefore, he cultivated many talents. He taught people with the Book of Poetry, Book of Documents, and the Six Arts. The Six Arts are rituals, music, archery, charioteering, writing, and mathematics. Rituals and music are for cultivating character and expressing emotions; archery and charioteering are for practicing military affairs and strengthening the body; writing and mathematics are the foundation of all sciences. Cultivating both body and mind, emphasizing both the literary and the martial, valuing both name and reality, he cultivated many talented individuals. Later generations only knew to teach people with the Book of Poetry and Book of Documents, but not with the Six Arts, and the ingrained habit of valuing literature became established. Those in power used the Six Classics to select officials, to win over people's hearts, and to open up paths to high office and lucrative positions, and thus Confucianism became untenable. Taking adherence to rules and regulations, sitting in silence and empty talk, as the merit of reverent reflection and thorough investigation of principles, the nation became weak, and the state's power declined to the point of being beyond repair. Therefore, the spirit of Confucius' teaching was lost, which is also the reason for China's accumulated weakness.</p>
<p>(3) Learn Confucius' spirit of struggle. Confucius' era was an era of contention among the states. The strong oppressed the weak, the many bullied the few, there was only might, no justice. The Zhou emperor held only a nominal title, unable to restrain the rampant behavior of the feudal lords. Wars were incessant, and the people suffered immensely. Confucius therefore wished to use the Way of Benevolence and Righteousness, invoking the names of ancient sages and wise kings, to subdue the hearts of the feudal lords and rescue the people from fire and water. Therefore, he traveled restlessly, without leisure to settle down, experiencing life in all directions. This spirit of his for the country, for the people, and for the Way, deeply penetrated people's hearts and served as a model for later generations.</p>
<p>(4) Learn Confucius' spirit of great fearlessness. Confucius was not afraid of the powerful and overbearing, as evidenced by his execution of Shaozheng Mao and the demolition of the Three Capitals. Therefore, in his revision of the Spring and Autumn Annals, he wrote what should be written and deleted what should be deleted, and rebellious ministers and villainous sons were afraid. He was also able to resolve conflicts at banquets and quell disasters in moments. When he assisted Duke Lu in meeting with the Duke of Qi at Jiagu, the Lai people threatened him with soldiers. Confucius rebuked them with great righteousness, and the Duke of Qi was ashamed and returned the occupied territory to Lu to apologize. Without Confucius' spirit of great fearlessness, how could he have repelled the Lai barbarian soldiers and recovered the lost territory at the conference?</p>
<p>(5) Learn Confucius' spirit of respecting the king and repelling the barbarians. In Confucius' time, the influence of barbarians living among the Chinese was gradually increasing. Confucius was concerned about this, so he created the doctrine of respecting the king and repelling the barbarians to attract public attention. Respecting the king meant nominally respecting the Zhou king, but it was directed at the barbarians. The Zhou king was the representative of China, and respecting the king was actually respecting China. Although after Confucius, the barbarians caused trouble for China, with the Rebellion of the Five Barbarian Tribes and the Manchus of the Liao, Jin, Yuan, and Qing dynasties ruling China, in the end, the old order was restored, all because Confucius' doctrine of respecting the king and repelling the barbarians was still deeply rooted in people's hearts. If later generations can truly practice the Way of Confucius, "sacrificing one's life to achieve benevolence" and "abandoning life to uphold righteousness," then the national spirit can be promoted.</p>
<p>Modern people often "fail to find the middle way" regarding the Way of Confucius. Those who revere him almost equate him with Jesus and Buddha. It should be understood that Confucianism is a doctrine of humanity, not divinity, and does not possess the conditions of a religion. As for wanting to save the country by reading the classics, it is untenable in theory and impossible in reality. However, the Way of Confucius is a path that we must not ignore. However, these vast classics with profound and difficult sentences are gradually becoming unreadable by modern people. Therefore, how to enable everyone to have the opportunity to learn Confucian doctrines? This task of continuing and organizing must be entrusted to the descendants of the sages. The Classic of Filial Piety quotes a poem saying, "Do not forget your ancestors; cultivate their virtues." The Sacrificial Official of the Four Sages should bear this in mind.</p>

<p>(London) Guo Taiqi, the Chinese envoy, has now been promoted to ambassador. Today, he entered Buckingham Palace to meet the British King. According to ambassadorial custom, three royal carriages were dispatched, each drawn by two chestnut horses. The coachmen and postilions were all dressed in scarlet uniforms, wearing feathered hats, to carry him into the palace (the ambassador provided his own vehicle). Accompanying him were Counselor Chen of the embassy, naval attaché Zeng, and three other staff members. Ambassador Guo rode in the first carriage, accompanied by Sir Clive, the ambassadorial master of ceremonies. Ambassador Guo personally presented his new credentials, and the British King greeted him with joy and spoke with him for several minutes.

<p>(Tokyo) Matsumoto Tadao, Special Envoy of the Foreign Ministry, has returned to Japan at 8:30 AM today after touring various parts of China for approximately 50 days, during which he met with key figures in the Central Government, North China, and Southwest China. He had been working to adjust Sino-Japanese relations from the sidelines.

<p>The Hague: After today's meeting of the Italian-Ethiopian Mixed Arbitration Commission, negotiations reached a stalemate, and it was decided to abandon the work and not hold any more meetings. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italians are neither surprised nor particularly disappointed by news that the commission investigating the Italian-Ethiopian dispute, convened in Scheveningen, may suspend its meetings, as they believe that the dispute cannot be resolved through negotiation. From all appearances, Italy wishes to seek satisfaction through military action. Several sources openly state that they wish for war to begin before August 25th, as that is the date on which the case is to be submitted to the League of Nations. Others say that Italy will not launch an attack until at least 250,000 troops are assembled in East Africa, as the Ethiopian army numbers about one million. The exact number of Italian troops currently in East Africa is difficult to determine. It is currently believed that the large army stationed in the Italian colonies in East Africa, including native troops, numbers about 150,000. The supply of food and water and the fact that the rainy season must end around September are also important reasons for not launching an immediate war. The Italian Army General Staff has already determined the strategy for attacking Ethiopia, but unless the League of Nations takes coercive measures, war will not break out until at least the end of August. According to reliable sources, the Italian government may not agree to the League of Nations' proposal that if the investigative commission fails, arbitrators should be appointed before July 25th. Therefore, people here believe that the negotiation process set by the League of Nations is now a dead letter, and Italy will proceed with its own direct method of resolving the dispute.

<p>(London) League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol met with British Foreign Secretary Hoare and Minister Without Portfolio Eden at the British Foreign Office today. After the meeting, a statement was released saying that they had discussed various issues that the League of Nations should handle in the near future. The statement did not mention the Abyssinian affair. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol arrived here last night from Geneva and will discuss the Italian-Ethiopian dispute with British Foreign Secretary Hoare. If the commission investigating the Italian-Ethiopian dispute, convened in Scheveningen, fails to appoint arbitrators by July 25th, then the case must naturally be handled by the League of Nations Council.

<p>(Geneva) If the negotiations of the Italian-Ethiopian investigative commission in Scheveningen have indeed broken down, the Ethiopian government will likely ask the League of Nations Council to convene a meeting immediately. Whether to convene an emergency meeting will be decided by Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov, the chairman of the Council. The League of Nations now believes that the situation is almost at a dead end. If the League of Nations Council convenes a meeting before the scheduled date of August 25th, Italy may refuse to attend. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e26">Wal Wal Sovereignty Issue Prompts Arbitration Stalemate: Britain and France Still Seeking Compromise <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The Hague: Rumor has it that the Italian-Ethiopian Mixed Arbitration Commission has halted its work due to conflicting opinions between the representatives of both sides. The commission was originally scheduled to hold a meeting today, but it has been canceled. Although the reason for the breakdown is kept secret and cannot be ascertained, it is said to be due to the Italian-Ethiopian border issue raised by the Ethiopian representative, Professor Sist of the University of Paris, last Friday. The Italian representative believed that the commission's authority was only to determine responsibility for the Wal Wal incident, so he refused to discuss the border issue. The Ethiopian side, on the other hand, believed that it was necessary to first prove whether Wal Wal was Ethiopian territory before the responsibility for the incident could be determined. At the League of Nations Council meeting on May 25 of this year, Italian representative Baron Aloisi had agreed that the Mixed Arbitration Commission could discuss any factors that could affect the resolution of the dispute, especially the interpretation of border treaties. However, after the Arbitration Commission met, the Italian representative suddenly overturned the previous agreement, and the arbitration work fell into a stalemate. It is said that the representatives of both sides will hold an informal meeting tomorrow to decide whether the commission should continue its work. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Scheveningen: The work of the Italian-Ethiopian dispute arbitration commission was completely suspended today. The commission has been meeting here for several weeks according to the provisions of the 1928 arbitration treaty between the two countries, and now it has reached a stalemate. The Italian-Ethiopian dispute originated from border conflicts between the two countries, the earliest of which occurred last November, when an Ethiopian tribe invaded the Italian Somaliland. With the establishment of the Arbitration Commission, the active preparation of both sides for war, the mutual disputes between Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Ethiopian King Selassie, each holding to his own position, and the recent request for the United States to uphold the non-war pact, the hope for mediation has become increasingly dim. (Guomin, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) Diplomatic circles generally believe that the League of Nations cannot exercise a strong policy against Italy, so the possibility of invoking Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, requiring economic sanctions, if Italy attacks Ethiopia is no longer being considered. Well-informed sources point out that the only way to resolve the Italian-Ethiopian dispute is for France to come forward to mediate, so that Italy and Ethiopia can compromise. Currently, the British and French governments are holding negotiations, hoping to find an effective way to avoid war between Italy and Ethiopia. When the House of Commons discusses foreign policy on the 11th of this month, Foreign Secretary Hoare will explain the policy adopted by Britain. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) Professor Yarvens, the diplomatic correspondent for the Morning Post, recently published an article explaining the origins of the proposals made by Minister Without Portfolio Eden to the Italian government, stating that Britain had already proposed to Ethiopia in 1925 to cede one-tenth of British Somaliland to Ethiopia in exchange for the benefits of the upper reaches of the Blue Nile. In addition, Britain also proposed to allow Ethiopia to use the port of Zeila in British Somaliland and build a railway to connect Zeila with the Ethiopian capital. This proposal was negotiated at the time, and Italy expressed its support, but it failed due to opposition from Ethiopia and France. When Eden departed for Rome, the British government decided to re-propose the old matter in order to resolve the Italian-Ethiopian dispute. (Havas, 9th)</p>

<h3 id="e28">German Shipbuilding Program: Britain Has Plans to Expand Navy <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) Based on the recent Anglo-German Naval Agreement, the German naval shipbuilding program is as follows: New ships already built and to be built in 1935: (1) Two battleships of 26,000 tons, armed with 28cm caliber guns; (2) Two cruisers of 10,000 tons, armed with 20cm caliber guns; (3) Sixteen destroyers of 1,625 tons, armed with 12.7cm caliber guns; (4) Twenty submarines of 250 tons, the first of which will be commissioned on June 29, and the remaining two have also been built; Six submarines of 500 tons and two submarines of 750 tons. The construction of the first aircraft carrier and the 1936 shipbuilding plan have now been completed. The shipbuilding plan after 1936 is still being planned. (Guomin, 8th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Berliner Tageblatt commented on the government's published shipbuilding program for this year, saying that this shipbuilding program is very moderate. The British battleship "Hood" has a displacement of over 46,000 tons and a gun caliber of 20cm. The French battleship Dunkerque also has a slightly larger tonnage than the German battleship of the same class, and its gun caliber is 33cm. Italy's four largest battleships all have a gun caliber of 30cm, which is much larger than the German battleship's gun caliber of 28cm. The report also said that the main purpose of the warships built by Germany is for use in the Baltic Sea and the North Sea. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) There was absolutely no objection here to the notice of Germany's 1935 shipbuilding program. Only a few newspapers made some criticisms, but they were all satisfied that the numbers of ships listed in the notice were much smaller than the provisions of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. Taking submarines as an example, the total tonnage is only 9,000 tons, which is less than one-tenth of the submarine tonnage of other naval powers. It is clear that the intention is only to defend the coastal areas. The Daily Telegraph correspondent believes that Germany's naval plan has been influenced to some extent by the French naval plan, as its first-line battleships are intended to counter the French Dunkerque-class battlecruisers. (Guomin, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Telegraph's naval expert, Piwart, predicted today that Britain's shipbuilding plan seems to include ten new-type cruisers. The number of light surface ships and naval aircraft for dealing with submarines will also be greatly expanded. The number of aircraft is approximately limited to two per cruiser or battleship. Piwart further said that Britain not only does not regard the United States as a naval competitor, but also sees the expansion of the United States Pacific Fleet as the only guarantee of preventing war. (Guomin, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) According to the Daily Telegraph, the Washington Naval Treaty will be abolished from the year after next, and British cruisers will no longer be limited to 50 ships. At that time, the number of British cruisers should be increased to at least 60 ships. Furthermore, Admiral Jellicoe, former First Lord of the Admiralty, Petty, and former Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Keyes, advocate that Britain must have 70 cruisers. (Havas, 9th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) The German army held its first mechanized exercise in the south of Saxony and the north of Bavaria, northwest of the Czech border. Führer Hitler, Defense Minister Blombach, and Army Commander-in-Chief General Fritsch all went to observe the exercise. The theme of the exercise was the transportation of troops. Assuming that enemy aircraft and artillery bombed the station, the military authorities should requisition private freight and passenger cars for transportation. The exercise was held in the dark, and all vehicles had their lights turned off. (Havas, 8th)</p>

<p>The Issue of the Jurisdiction of the Halaha Temple is the Crux: Japan to Issue Statement on the Arrest of Inukai</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The 12th meeting of the Manchurian Conference was held on the 6th, but it broke down due to Mongolia's strong stance. The Japanese government, in response to the statement by the Acting Prime Minister of Mongolia regarding the illegal arrest of Japanese surveyor Inukai, and the TASS news agency's distortion of the truth of the incident, decided to issue an important statement within days, clarifying the attitude of the Japanese government. (Nichi-Ren, 9th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) "Manchukuo" announced today that the Manchurian-Mongolian conference in Manchuria had its 12th meeting on the 6th, and the result was not good. It came to a standstill over the issue of the jurisdiction of the Halaha Temple. The "Manchu" side insisted that it belonged to "Manchu" based on historical grounds, while Outer Mongolia insisted that it belonged to Russia, and they argued over the original agreement. (China United, 9th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The "Manchukuo" Second Public Bond of 30 million yuan for purchasing the Chinese Eastern Railway will be issued by the underwriting banking group this week under the following conditions: interest rate of 4%, issue price of 98 yuan per 100 yuan face value, and repayment period of 10 years. (Dentsu, 9th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) In a speech delivered on July 5, the acting chairman of the Mongolian government, Choibalsan, pointed out that the "Manchu" Foreign Ministry representative Ganji (transliteration) had demanded from the Mongolian delegation chairman Sambuu in Manchuria that the Japanese officer Inukai and his guards, who had been arrested in Mongolian territory, should be immediately returned to the puppet government, that Mongolia should apologize to the puppet government, and that the person responsible for arresting the Japanese officer should be punished. A reporter from the TASS news agency stationed in Kulun has now confirmed that after Mongolia received news that the puppet government would make these demands (when Sambuu had not yet received the Japanese notification regarding the request of July 4), it immediately instructed Sambuu to make the following important statement to the Japanese and Manchu authorities:</p>
<p>(1) Although the Mongolian authorities have proven that the Japanese officer Inukai and his Russian follower Habura were arrested in Mongolian territory, and although the two men have written proof of this, the two men were released before your request was received. This can prove Mongolia's goodwill and desire for peace. (2) When these individuals were released, most of their belongings (including horses and carts) were also returned. To further express its peaceful wishes, Mongolia will also return all of the withheld parts of their belongings to the Japanese officer and his companions. (3) To avoid further border incidents, Mongolia proposes to convene a joint Mongolian-Manchu committee to review various border incidents on the spot. (4) We propose that this committee should be set up in the territory where the Japanese officer and his Russian follower were arrested on June 23. Mongolia declares in advance that if it can be proven that they were arrested in Manchu territory, it is willing to apologize to Manchu and punish the personnel responsible for the arrest. (TASS, 9th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry today declined to comment on the official note recently sent to Outer Mongolia regarding the arrest of Japanese and "Manchu" surveyors on the "Manchu"-Mongolian border, citing the reason that the Foreign Ministry "does not know what relationship the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia actually have." The spokesman said that the Foreign Ministry only knew that "Manchukuo" had issued a protest regarding this arrest incident because the arrest location was within "Manchukuo" territory, but the Outer Mongolian authorities claimed that the arrested person had illegally crossed into Mongolian territory. This matter is still to be determined, but the negotiations regarding this matter have nothing to do with the ongoing "Manchu"-Soviet conference, as that conference is currently only discussing the border issue of the Halaha Temple. People here generally believe that Moscow's reference to Ulan Bator's report as "official" news this time has confused both Japanese and "Manchu" officials and non-officials alike, because it has always been rumored that Outer Mongolia is controlled by the Soviet Union, and its foreign policy is no exception.

<p>(Nanjing) The Navy convened a first provincial conference this morning at the minister's residence, with the participation of Chief of the Naval Technical Department Nakamura, Vice-Chief of the Electrical Command Department Kato, Vice-Minister Hasegawa, and other senior officials, to decide on the budget for the coming year. However, the amounts requested by various departments from the financial departments have reached 1 billion yuan, of which new requests exceed 600 million yuan. The Navy Ministry also believes that the expenditure is too large and will leave the rest for the following year, except for those that are urgently needed. Therefore, it has only approved about 300 million yuan, which, combined with the base budget of 400 million yuan, amounts to about 700 million yuan. The main items of the proposed new requests are roughly as follows: (1) Subsidies for warship construction in the eleventh year (156 million yuan); (1) land and water facilities preparation costs; (1) aviation corps equipment costs; (1) warship refitting costs; (1) armament improvement costs.

Britain plans to convene a five-nation economic conference on China, including Britain, the United States, Japan, France, and Italy, in October after Mr. Rose, a special envoy to China, arrives in Shanghai.

<p>Japan Expands Aviation Industry: Ten-Year Plan Drafted</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Aviation Industry Investigation Committee Secretariat, composed of representatives from the Army, Navy, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Communications, has deliberated on a ten-year plan to expand civil aviation in eight sessions and has reached a consensus. It is scheduled to convene the Aviation Committee on the 12th to formally approve the plan. As the Secretariat hopes to expand air routes, the original budget of 190 million yuan has been increased to over 200 million yuan. The plan reportedly includes expanding the facilities of the existing six airfields, establishing three new airfields, establishing fifteen new local airfields and temporary landing sites, constructing international air routes, training aircraft crew members, controlling the aircraft manufacturing industry, and establishing aviation radio stations. These urgent needs are expected to be completed in three to four years. (9th, Japan United Press Telegram)</p>

However, the purpose of the US purchases is to prevent silver prices from falling rather than to raise prices. It is learned today that the current multilateral settlement is a natural result of the surge in silver prices in mid-April of this year. Although the market conditions at that time were quite abnormal, the future development is still entirely in the hands of the US government. If the United States continues its previous policies, the market conditions will still be artificially distorted. The US absorbed as much spot silver as possible offered here on Monday this week, but prices fell sharply, making speculators hesitant. Therefore, a large sell-off will be a natural trend, especially in India. Experts here believe that the current speculative situation has gradually become more normal, and there are buyers behind the short sellers. (8th, National Telegram)</p>
<p>(New York) Bank street exchange merchants indicated tonight that the exchange rate of the British pound against the US dollar in the foreign exchange market today has significantly increased, possibly due to the US Treasury Department increasing its silver purchases abroad, rather than any changes in international currency conditions. Today, the British pound has reached the same exchange rate as the highest this year, so those engaged in foreign exchange are paying close attention. (8th, National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The London Financial Times commented on the US silver policy today, stating that according to private telegrams from the US, although the US has not refused to purchase silver, it will no longer actively purchase silver, as President Roosevelt seems to have realized that the cost of buying off the pro-silver faction of Congressmen is too high. If President Roosevelt refuses the demands of the silver politicians, the sale of silver will be like a tidal wave. (9th, Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Albany: After heavy rains, rivers in New York State have flooded, inundating many roads to a depth of four to six feet. Many bridges and dams have been washed away, and many houses have collapsed, with much damage to crops. Almost no part of New York State has been spared from the floods, with 14 deaths by drowning and 4 missing. Estimated losses are no less than $2 million. In the Basset area, 75 cars and streetcars are trapped in the water. Gas and electricity supplies have been cut off in Connersville. The police station, fire department, and Salvation Army offices are sheltering refugees and are filled to capacity. In Mahopac Village, the water is 10 to 12 feet deep. 600 feet of railroad track have been washed away on the Canajoharie Railroad, and four trains are currently stranded in Buffalo, unable to proceed.

<p>(New York) After heavy rains, New York State has been followed by floods. Residents in low-lying areas have evacuated. Twenty-three people have already drowned. Hundreds of travelers on roads in the central part of the state are stranded. Sidewalks along the railroads have been washed away, and many bridges have collapsed. The largest city in the disaster area is Ithaca, which is now the headquarters for relief efforts. Most unfortunately, there were also fires during the floods. A very large gas depot in Hornell Town caught fire, threatening to spread. Because the depot could explode at any time, a small spark could start a prairie fire. Currently, there is no accurate detailed report on the loss of life and property in the floods. (8th, National Telegram)</p>

<p>Advocates Supporting Roosevelt</p>
<p>Council Bluffs: Today, Sinclair spoke in the hometown of former President Hoover's childhood, advocating that in the next presidential election, Hoover should not be elected again. In today's economic panic, we must not form another third party, nor can we abandon President Roosevelt and elect Hoover. I do not intend to insult Hoover, but I do not want him to be the next president of the United States. Sinclair, originally a socialist and a well-known American writer, is currently the nominal leader of the California Democratic Party. Last November, he launched the "End Poverty in California" (EPIC) plan and participated in the California gubernatorial election, which failed. Recently, Sinclair visited Roosevelt, seeking to promote his "EPIC" plan nationwide. Sinclair's statement against the formation of a third party is likely to have a significant impact on the current political situation in the United States. In recent days, liberals and radicals have gathered in Chicago to advocate the formation of a third party, and the American Republican Political League has also used Sinclair's "EPIC" as a slogan. Therefore, Sinclair's move carries significant weight. (8th, National Telegram)</p>

<p>(Rome) The Greek Minister of War, General Kondylis, arrived here yesterday morning with several senior officials.

Veterans of the Italian war gave him the first reception in Rome yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, and he was received by Deputy Foreign Minister Suvich at 6:00 PM. As for seeing the Italian King and meeting with Prime Minister Mussolini, dates have already been set. Therefore, judging from various circumstances, it is quite difficult to believe that the so-called trip is of a private nature. It is said that the main issues to be discussed are the Mediterranean Pact and the restoration of the Greek monarchy, in order to test the extent to which the two countries can cooperate.

<p>(Paris) The Fifth International Astronomical Congress is scheduled to be held within this week. Most countries in the world have sent representatives to attend, totaling about 300 people. The Congress has a standing committee of 35, whose responsibility is to record achievements and coordinate work. Astronomy, as a science, cannot succeed without the concerted efforts of all countries in the world. For example, drawing celestial charts, compiling star catalogs, observing parallax, measuring the speed of light radiation, the movement of light bands, determining longitude, and other various issues all require the precise division of labor and cooperation of 550 astronomical observatories around the world to achieve success. One of the main tasks of this Congress is to unify astronomical research methods, specialized terminology, publishing endeavors, and even instruments worldwide. The Chinese Ministry of Education has appointed Gao Jun and Pan Pu as representatives to attend the Congress. (9th, Havas Telegram)</p>

To commemorate this glorious event, we must understand the reasons for success, which are approximately as follows: (1) The ability to earnestly implement the teachings of the Premier, who stated that the first step of the National Revolution must be to eliminate domestic obstacles; (2) The existence of a strict organization, enabling the Party Army to concentrate its strength despite its small numbers; (3) The ability of the entire group to unite sincerely and work together. In addition, the entire nation hoped for the Revolutionary Army's success, enabling it to conquer all and break through all obstacles; (4) The recognition of the need for education among Revolutionary Army soldiers, hence the emphasis on wisdom, benevolence, and courage as the foundation of education.

After the ceremony, Chairman Chiang delivered a speech for one hour and twenty minutes. At 11:00 AM, photographs were taken, and the meeting adjourned. Chairman Chiang's speech is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"Principal Wang and Comrades, today we gather at Sichuan University to hold Premier Sun's Memorial Week. This is the first time I have met with all the faculty, staff, and students, especially the graduating class. I am able to meet you here today, which is truly a rare opportunity. Taking this opportunity, I would like to speak to you about the purpose of our studies, the essence of education, and the responsibilities and things that everyone should pay attention to. As you all know, the general public in Sichuan and even the entire country are suffering greatly. Many of you faculty, staff, and students come from rural areas, and you must know more deeply than we do about the suffering of the general public in your hometowns. Now that the suffering of the general public is so profound, we should find ways to relieve them. We should definitely find ways to relieve the suffering in our own hometowns, and we should also find ways to relieve the suffering of the general public throughout the country. This responsibility of saving the country and the people should be shouldered by us intellectuals, especially the students in the universities. We must understand that the purpose of our studies is to save the country and the people, to seek happiness for the people, and to win glory for the country. As the ancients said, "The rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of every individual." We intellectuals, as those who are aware and perceptive in society, should especially understand this principle. We must first establish the great aspiration of saving the country and the people in our pursuit of knowledge to save the country and the people, in preparation for serving the society and the country in the future. Do not think that after studying in school for a few years and graduating, you can get a diploma, go out to teach, or do other things in society, or even become an official and get rich. If the purpose of studying is only this, only seeking personal comfort and having nothing to do with the suffering of a family, a village, or the entire society, then it completely violates the purpose of learning and being a person, and it is not the original intention of national education to educate the general youth. We must have the ambition to be concerned about the world, to take the world's affairs as our own responsibility, just like what the ancient Yi Yin said, "If there is a single man or woman in the world who has not received the favor of Yao and Shun, it is as if I pushed them into a ditch," and what Fan Zhongyan said, "Be the first to worry about the world's worries and the last to enjoy its pleasures." The purpose of general students seeking knowledge should be like this, and the purpose of general faculty and staff teaching students is to teach them the knowledge of self-cultivation, family governance, state governance, and world peace to save the country and the people. Only in this way can it be considered true education, and only in this way can the effect of education be generated. Only students educated in this way can truly shoulder the responsibility of saving the country and the people. Every year, many students graduate from schools in Sichuan, but why do they not seem to be of much benefit to Sichuan and the country? Why can't they improve society and relieve the suffering of the general public in Sichuan and throughout the country? Nowadays, some people think that the reason why social customs are corrupt and the general public is suffering so much is due to the poor quality of the army, and therefore they hate soldiers. But this is only one of the important reasons, and it can even be said that it is not the fundamental reason. The fundamental reason is that the people who are responsible for education, the general students, and all the intellectuals in society have not fulfilled their responsibility to lead the people and transform society. They themselves have no ambition and do not fulfill their responsibilities, and they only blame the soldiers. This is not right. Everyone should also know that the suffering of the entire society cannot be relieved by one person or a few people. It requires the concerted efforts of the general faculty, staff, and students, as well as all the intellectuals in society, to work together and share the responsibility in order to achieve it. Sichuan University is the highest institution of learning in Sichuan. The general students of Sichuan University have an even greater responsibility to Sichuan. Now you should ask yourselves whether your morality, spirit, and intelligence are sound, whether you can be a model for the general public in society, and whether you are trusted and admired by them, and whether you have the foundation to lead the people, transform society, and benefit your hometown. If you do not have such aspirations now, if you do not cultivate yourselves in this way, if you do not make such preparations and efforts, then when you graduate in the future, you will not be able to contribute to the society and the country, and you will not be worthy of being university students, and you will be ashamed of the country and your parents. When we talk about the methods of leading the general public in society, from the root, it lies in education. Whether they are faculty members, graduates, or undergraduates, or people in the education field, or officials in government agencies, they are all intellectuals cultivated by the country and have the responsibility of education. To fulfill this responsibility, we must make everyone who comes into contact with us, in terms of morality, spirit, and academics, be influenced by us for the better, and be able to work together with us to increase the interests of the society and the country.

<h3 id="e108">Hope Lost for Resumption of Work at Liujiang Mine: Tao Shangming's Negotiations with Ii Are Ineffective; Over 3,000 Employees of the Coal Mine Have Been Laid Off <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The dispute between the Liujiang Coal Mine and the Taiji Coal Mine had previously evolved from a local diplomatic issue into negotiations between the provincial government and the Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin. When the Hebei Provincial Government had not yet moved to Baoding, one side assigned Councilor Chen Dongsheng to be responsible for contacting the Japanese side, while the other side telegraphed the Peiping Military Branch, the Political Reorganization Committee, and the Ministries of Industry and Foreign Affairs in Nanjing, hoping to obtain an order from above from the highest Japanese embassy to seek a solution. However, just as Japanese Consul-General Kawayue in Tianjin agreed to withdraw the Japanese police from the power plant of the Heishanyao Mine in Liujiang and restore water pumping, the Hebei Provincial Government suddenly received an order to move to Baoding. The Director of the Department of Reconstruction was busy with the relocation and had no time to attend to this matter. For over a month, the overall situation in Hebei has not been stabilized, and this matter has fallen into a standstill in negotiations. On July 18, the shareholders of the Liujiang Mine held a meeting in Shanghai and drafted a backward-step plan to achieve a peaceful solution. The person in charge of the mine was unofficially sent to negotiate with Mr. Ishida Hisatomo, the Japanese manager of the Taiji Mine. Ishida expressed a tough stance, insisting that the mining area belonged to Taiji Mine. Not only would it not be returned, but compensation must also be paid for the years of encroachment. If the Liujiang Mine insisted on resuming work, then it would be reorganized into a Sino-Japanese joint venture with the Taiji Mine. The Liujiang Mine considered the conditions to be too harsh and did not have room for negotiation, so the negotiations yielded no results. The Ministry of Industry, upon Liujiang Mine's repeated pleas to resolve the matter in accordance with the Mining Law to avoid prolonged delays and heavy losses, ordered Tao Shangming, the Commissioner of the Ao-Yu Administrative Area, to be responsible for negotiating with the Japanese side. Tao proposed a method of persuading and explaining, and on July 3, he went to Yumenguan to discuss with Ii. As a result, he learned that the Japanese side's attitude had not changed, and there was little hope for a peaceful resolution. He telegraphed Tangshan on the 4th to report to the Ministry of Industry. Zheng Songhua and Fang Zhiwu, the persons in charge of the Liujiang Coal Mine, returned to Qinhuangdao at the end of last month after attending the shareholders' meeting in Shanghai. They immediately rushed to finish the closing, waiting for news from Tao Shangming. When they learned that there was no hope for a turn, they issued one month's salary for July to all 3,000 employees of the mine on the 5th and laid them off. A management committee was formed to take care of the machinery, mining area, warehouses, and property. Only 20 workers were left at the mining area power plant to take on the water pumping work to prevent the well from being destroyed by water. However, the negotiations will not stop during the process. The mine has been operating for more than 30 years, producing both anthracite and bituminous coal. The coking coal is particularly good and is the only good coal mine in North China run by Chinese merchants. It has been very profitable over the years. Now it has been abandoned due to the Japanese coveting it and using the excuse of competing for the mine. The total loss of the mine's property is estimated to be over 40 million yuan. The coal reserves that have not been mined are extremely rich. The coal stored in the Qinhuangdao wharf and warehouse alone reaches over 600,000 tons, all of which are sealed off and cannot be transported and sold. The losses of railways and all other attached buildings are also considerable. The Japanese police did not express any opinions when the mine voluntarily stopped mining, and the monitors have not yet been withdrawn. It is unknown when these negotiations will be resolved.

<p>The Guangkan Wheel, which travels between Kunshan and Taicang, was operating the Fuliu Bridge route on the 5th. In the afternoon, when the ship was sailing through Taicang, Yu Jinbiao, an off-duty officer from the 12th team of tax police, boarded the ship without a ticket. Han Xiangsheng, a staff member of the ship, asked him to buy a ticket, but to no avail, and a brief quarrel broke out. When the ship passed Shatou Town, it should have been traveling slowly. Yu Jinbiao jumped onto a wooden raft, intending to go ashore. The crew member Hui Xiangsheng went forward to negotiate with Yu and was pulled onto the raft by Yu and taken to the team headquarters, where he was privately hung and beaten. At the same time, other officers detained the ship. After the beating was completed, he was sent to the Shatou Public Security Bureau with a written statement. Upon hearing the news, all the ships went on strike starting on the 6th. Fortunately, the Party and government agencies and the ship authorities worked with the county chamber of commerce to come up with a solution. The employees sent Zhao Yaoru and three others as representatives to negotiate together. Fortunately, all the employees were able to accept the mediation. The matter of the injured party who was beaten will be transferred to the judiciary for handling. Normal sailing resumed on the early shift on the 8th.</p>

<p>Due to continuous rain followed by mountain torrents in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the river level has been rising continuously, and the water has reached the shore at various ports along the lake. Various shipping companies in Shanghai, such as China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Butterfield &amp; Swire, Jardine Matheson, Sanpei Steam Navigation Company, Ning Shao Steam Navigation Company, and Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, have specially sent official letters to various merchant guilds yesterday, stating: "Due to the continuous rise of the Yangtze River and the potential for flooding in Hunan and various ports along the lake, cargo stored in the engine rooms of various shipping companies at those ports should be taken care of by the cargo owners to ensure safety. Otherwise, the shipping companies will not be responsible for any losses. Furthermore, for the sake of protecting the cargo, if the shipping companies move the cargo, the responsibility will still be borne by the cargo owners, and the costs will be collected from the consignees when the goods are shipped in the future.

<h3 id="e118">Strict Boycott of Siamese Rice, Siam Seems to be Gradually Softening. Another Inspection Group Will Come to China at the End of the Month to Prepare for Negotiating a Sino-Siamese Treaty. <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>According to the New News Agency, it has been more than two months since the anti-Chinese incidents occurred in Siam. People in our country are quite indignant about this, and various groups have risen to help, automatically banning the transportation and sale of Siamese rice, and implementing economic sanctions against Siam to awaken the Siamese government. Recently, a large batch of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai. Various aid groups sent standing committee members such as Huang Jianzhong to conduct strict investigations to see if any Siamese rice was mixed in. At the same time, they also visited Gu Shengyi of the Rice Industry Association to inquire about the results. It was learned that the foreign rice, totaling 50,000 bags, was from Saigon, Vietnam, and no Siamese rice was mixed in. It was also learned that the Siamese government, in view of the strict boycott of Siamese rice by the Chinese people, which has severely impacted the economic prospects of the rice industry, is now gradually softening its stance. It will send another inspection group to China at the end of this month to investigate the real situation of the boycott of Siamese rice and indirectly exchange views with the Chinese government on establishing diplomatic relations, in order to prepare for the signing of a Sino-Siamese commercial treaty.</p>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Federation reported yesterday that China will organize a delegation to Siam for investigation. The association hopes that this could become a reality and will promote it, because sending a delegation to Siam can meet with the Siamese authorities and recount the friendship between the two countries in East Asian history. It can also inspect the scope of the businesses of the three million overseas Chinese in Siam, which is not to be taken lightly.</p>

<p>Mr. Chiang Tso-pin, the Chinese Ambassador to Japan, has returned to China on leave. He arrived in Shanghai at 8:00 AM yesterday morning on the President Grant of the Dollar Steamship Lines. Representatives from the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs went to the port to welcome him. After disembarking, he went to the International Hotel to rest. He took the night train to Nanjing at 11:00 PM last night. It has not yet been decided whether he will go to Sichuan to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Mr. Chiang's leave is for one month, and he will return to his post after the leave expires. The affairs of the embassy will be temporarily handled by Counselor Ding Shaoji. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrival in Shanghai: The President Grant, on which Ambassador Chiang arrived, entered the port at 3:30 AM yesterday morning. The welcoming personnel from various circles in Shanghai took a special launch from the Jianghai Customs Wharf at around 7:00 AM yesterday morning to the Dollar Dock to welcome him. They included Yu Ming, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Secretary Zhou Gui, Section Chief Zhao Tiezhang, Secretary Tang Shixuan representing Mayor Wu, Secretary Wang Zhinan of the Municipal Security Office, Wu Kaisheng, former acting Chargé d'Affaires in Switzerland, and dozens of relatives and friends of Mr. Chiang.

<p>Ambassador Chiang's Speech: Ambassador Chiang met with reporters from various newspapers in the reception room of the President Grant and gave a speech, saying: "I have no mission on this return to China. It is purely because I have been stationed abroad for two years and have not yet returned to China, so I have specially requested leave to return to China for a visit. On the one hand, I will report the progress of my mission abroad to the central government, and on the other hand, I can inspect the domestic situation. I plan to stay in the country for one month and then return to my post. I will not stay in Shanghai for long and will go to Nanjing immediately. However, because President Wang is being treated for illness in Shanghai, I plan to visit President Wang in Shanghai first. Whether I will go to Sichuan to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has not yet been decided. I plan to take advantage of this leave to return to my hometown of Yingcheng for a visit."</p>

<h3 id="e120">Yesterday was the Anniversary of the Northern Expedition Pledge Ceremony. Representatives from All Walks of Life Held a General Assembly Yesterday. <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 9th) was the 9th anniversary of the National Revolutionary Army's pledge to launch the Northern Expedition. The Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, in order to commemorate the spirit of struggle and sacrifice of the soldiers led by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, specially followed the central government's regulations and convened representatives from all walks of life to hold a commemorative meeting. All circles in Shanghai hung flags to celebrate, but there was no holiday. The authorities of the Chinese and foreign concessions took strict precautions to prevent disturbances by criminals. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives</p>
<p>Jiang Huaisu of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Wang Zongjian of the Jianghai Customs Supervision Department, Gao Jie of the Second Branch of the Higher Court, Tan Gengxin of the Municipal Audit Office, Lin Kecong of the Municipal Women's Association, Zhang Lichun of the Municipal Education Association, Du Mengsen of the Cooperative Enterprise Promotion Association, Lu Yinchu of the Chinese Labor Association, Wu Zishi of the China Promotion of National Goods Association, Zhu Shide of the China National Goods Maintenance Association, Wang Longzhang of the Popular Common Sense Guidance Association, and more than 200 representatives from various agencies, organizations, schools, and party branches such as the Shaoxing Fellow Association, the Changzhou Fellow Association, the Fifth District Stevedores Union, the Binshan Fellow Association, the Pharmaceutical Industry Union, and Tongji University.</p>
<p>General Assembly Staff</p>
<p>Chairman Jiang Huaisu, Recorder Tong Muge, Master of Ceremonies Huang E, Receptionists Huang Xiangru, He Yuanming, Li Erbai, Zhang Hanyun, Li Boqing, Wu Xianren, Zhu Diaochun, Du Mengsen, Lin Kecong, Wu Di, Bao Huizhong, etc. The Public Security Bureau dispatched police to maintain order at the meeting.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After the ceremony, the chairman gave a report, stating: "Today is the 9th anniversary of the National Revolutionary Army's pledge to launch the Northern Expedition in Shao Guan. Recalling the reorganization of the party in 1924, the party's organization became more solid, and on July 5, 1926, General Chiang Kai-shek was appointed as commander-in-chief, and on the 9th, the oath was taken and the Northern Expedition was launched, completing the mission within three years. Reviewing the party's past work, many weaknesses were found. The previous work was mostly unrealistic. Since the weaknesses of the past have been identified, we should change course. At present, the party and government are focusing all their efforts on the literacy movement, because literacy is one of the party's seven movements, giving the people practical benefits. When we commemorate the oath of the National Revolutionary Army, we should intensify the current literacy movement. Second, in the current state of global economic recession, everything in the country is in turmoil. Whether it is agriculture, industry, commerce, or education, all are agitated by the trend and fall into a state of turmoil, such as the increase in the number of unemployed and the arrogance of students. It is not known that things are extremely contradictory. On the one hand, China feels that there is no talent, but on the other hand, it is overflowing with affairs. The reason is that all circles are constantly moving and not settling in their careers. Therefore, today's commemoration of the oath of the National Revolutionary Army should especially strive for stability. Furthermore, since the Red Bandits have been supervised and suppressed by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, their power is exhausted and it is not difficult to eliminate them in the shortest possible time. From then on, we can devote all our efforts to construction and implement the party's propositions," and then shouted slogans and adjourned the meeting.</p>
<p>Hanging Flags to Celebrate</p>
<p>All agencies, organizations, schools, and party branches in Shanghai, in addition to sending representatives to the commemorative meeting convened by the Municipal Party Headquarters on the 9th anniversary of the National Revolutionary Army's oath, all hung flags to celebrate and congratulate. In the past, every year on the "79" anniversary, all agencies and schools had a day off. Now, because the central government has revised the commemoration method, all offices in Shanghai, except for holding commemorative meetings and hanging flags to celebrate, are open as usual.</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Concession Alert</p>
<p>Yesterday was a national commemorative day. The Shanghai Public Security Bureau, in order to prevent criminals from taking advantage of the opportunity to cause chaos, specially ordered its subordinate branches and police stations to increase patrols and dispatched inspectors and detectives to go out separately and together with the police on duty to inspect suspicious pedestrians. At the same time, patrols were increased, and special attention was paid to the roads adjacent to the Chinese Concession. The police departments of the Public Concession and the French Concession also ordered their respective police stations to send more detectives to patrol separately, paying special attention to the areas near factories to prevent reactionary elements from disrupting public order.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Verdict in the "New Life Weekly" Case: Du Chongyuan Sentenced to One Year and Two Months in Prison, No Appeal Allowed, No Bail Allowed, and Imprisoned Immediately <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The "New Life Weekly" office in Fuxing Lane, Fuzhou Road, in the 15th issue of the second volume of the magazine on May 4 this year, contained an article entitled "Idle Talk About Emperors" written by Yi Shui, which was suspected of defaming the Emperor of Japan. The Shanghai Municipal Government instructed the Municipal Public Security Bureau to request the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court Procuratorate to investigate. Zheng Yue, the chief prosecutor of the court, opened a court to investigate Du Chongyuan, the publisher and editor of the magazine, and Yi Shui, the author. Because Yi Shui's address was unknown, repeated summonses were unsuccessful. Zheng's chief investigation concluded that the society should bear criminal responsibility and ordered him to pay 500 yuan and a commercial guarantor to be released on bail and await further proceedings.</p>
<p>File a Public Prosecution</p>
<p>Now, Chief Prosecutor Zheng, in accordance with Article 310, Paragraph 2 of the new Criminal Law, Article 325, Paragraph 2 of the old Criminal Law, and Article 116 of the new Criminal Law on the crime of defamation, filed a public prosecution against Du Chongyuan in the criminal court of the same level. Yesterday morning, Yu Hua, the presiding judge of the Second Branch of the Higher Court Criminal Court, together with Judges Zhou Han and Xiao Xiefen and Chief Prosecutor Zheng, opened a criminal court for trial. The patrol of the police station, fearing an accident, specially dispatched a large number of detectives to guard around the court. At the same time, the Second Branch of the Higher Court also sent more than a dozen bailiffs to maintain order in the courtroom. However, the audience was still crowded. Du Chongyuan also came to the court with his lawyer Wu Kaisheng. First, Judge Yu</p>
<p>summoned Du to the defendant's column and asked about his age, address, and occupation. According to him, he was 38 years old, from Huaide County, Liaoning Province, working in Jiangxi, and temporarily residing in the "New Life Weekly" office in Shanghai, serving as the publisher and editor of the magazine. Because he had not been previously convicted of a criminal offense, Chief Prosecutor Zheng immediately rose to present the charges, stating: "The defendant in this case is the editor and publisher of "New Life Weekly". The 15th issue of the second volume of "New Life Weekly" contained an article entitled "Idle Talk About Emperors" written by Yi Shui.</p>
<p>The article mentioned the heads of friendly countries, and especially mentioned the Emperor of Japan, and contained defamatory remarks. The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau requested this office to investigate. Under investigation by this prosecutor, because the author Yi Shui</p>
<p>was repeatedly summoned without success, and the defendant in this case is the editor and publisher, he should bear full responsibility. In accordance with Article 310, Paragraph 2 of the new Criminal Law, Article 325, Paragraph 2 of the old Criminal Law for the crime of defamation, and Article 116 of the new Criminal Law, the original punishment should be increased by one-third. The court is requested to impose a heavy sentence in accordance with the law." Then, Du Chongyuan confessed that he had been running an industry in the Northeast. After the Northeast Incident, he came to Shanghai to be the organizer of the "New Life Bookstore" and the publisher and editor of the "New Life Weekly". The magazine was sold by the "Life Bookstore". At the beginning of April this year, I went to Jiangxi to run an industry, and an editor named Chen Xiang acted as my agent, so</p>
<p>I did not see this manuscript. At this time, Du's lawyer Wu Kaisheng immediately presented a letter to prove that Du was indeed in Jiangxi at that time. Then, Du continued to confess that after seeing the article in the "New Life Weekly", he knew that the author was using the eyes of a scholar to criticize the monarchical system of various countries. However, it can be determined that the author was not a student studying in Japan, so he did not understand the different situations and systems of Japan and other countries. However, the article seemed to admire the Emperor's learning very much. I am a student who has studied in Japan. If I were in Shanghai at that time, this manuscript would never have been published. But I should bear the responsibility for the oversight, so I now express</p>
<p>regret and apology. As for Yi Shui, because the manuscripts he submitted were unpaid, there is no address to check. The original manuscript is also impossible to find. I don't know if he knows about the occurrence of this case." At this point, the court ordered the debate to begin. Chief Prosecutor Zheng requested a sentence in accordance with the law. The defense of the defendant's lawyer Wu was briefly stated that because the defendant was not in Shanghai at that time, this unfortunate incident occurred. The responsibility for the oversight cannot be avoided. However, the defendant has expressed his apology and regret in court, and the articles charged by the prosecutor seem to be inconsistent. He should be acquitted. If the court believes that the defendant should bear</p>
<p>criminal responsibility, please impose a suspended sentence or a fine in lieu of imprisonment in accordance with Articles 74 and 41 of the Criminal Law." Judge Yu then declared the debate concluded, adjourned the court for deliberation, and then returned to his seat to announce the verdict: Du Chongyuan, jointly defaming by disseminating texts, sentenced to imprisonment for one year and two months, the 15th issue of the second volume of "New Life Weekly" confiscated. The defendant's lawyer requested a fine in lieu of imprisonment, which was not allowed by the court. He requested to be released on bail during the appeal period, which was deemed final because appeals were not allowed in accordance with Article 61 of the Criminal Law, so bail was not allowed. At that time, the people in the audience stood up and shouted and discovered leaflets. The bailiffs and detectives tried their best to stop them for a long time before dispersing those people.</p>

<p>Dai Enji, general manager of China National Aviation Corporation, previously went to Nanjing to visit Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Communications to report everything and planned to inspect Sichuan by plane. However, he turned back due to bad weather. According to Dai, he reported to Minister Zhu on the progress of the Charles Aircraft in the United States flight test, since the results were not perfect, purchase was discontinued. The reason for this purchase is that the aircraft on the Yangtze River route have been flying for a long time and need to be replaced with new aircraft. He also plans to purchase aircraft with more seats that can carry more mail. It is best to fly from Shanghai to Wuhan in four hours to seek speed. Everything is currently in the active planning stage. As for the Chongqing-Yunnan route, due to weather conditions, it only operates to Guiyang. It will be launched in Kunming in a few days, once a week, to seek convenience.</p>

<p>A telegram from Singapore calls for the addition of a large batch of goods. Contact at 425 Bazilu.</p>
<p>The Zhongxing Trading Company was organized by Cantonese merchants Chen Guili and Chen Guifei, with the purpose of promoting national goods and developing overseas trade. Last autumn, they sent personnel twice to investigate the international trade situation, carrying exquisite national products to Singapore and various islands in Nanyang. They chose places to display them, which had a very good effect. Seeing this, the company specially sent Mr. Chen Guifei to Nanyang this summer, carrying various exquisite samples. He first exhibited them at the Singapore Chamber of Commerce and the Great World Amusement Park, which was warmly welcomed by the overseas Chinese, who praised the rapid progress of China's industry. He once hosted a banquet for various circles to strengthen connections. Consul General Diao, Consul Shi Zheng, Deputy Consul Li, the president and vice president of the Chamber of Commerce, newspaper reporters, and business figures attended. They expressed their willingness to support Mr. Chen's efforts to develop international trade. Mr. Li Chunrong, the manager of the Great World Amusement Park, was willing to lend the site for display to promote publicity. It can be seen that overseas Chinese are happy to use national goods. Currently, the company has received a telegram from Singapore calling for the addition of a large batch of goods to meet the demand. It is said that many domestic manufacturers have brought samples to the company at 425 Bazilu to discuss business in recent days.</p>

<p>To Delay Implementation or Reduce Tax Rates</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factories United Association received a letter from the Henan Provincial National Goods Factories United Association yesterday stating: "We recently read in the newspaper that the draft Provisional Income Tax Regulations has been approved by the Central Political Conference and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. Although it has not been officially promulgated, we fear it will be implemented soon. While income tax systems exist in other countries, they present several difficulties when applied to our national conditions. Therefore, the government has repeatedly proposed and carefully considered its implementation. However, the current tax rate, adopting a progressive method, with the highest rate reaching two hundred per thousand, is excessive. Recently, industry and commerce have been depressed, and finance is extremely tight. We hope the government will provide relief by slightly reducing all taxes to alleviate the difficulties of businesses and encourage development. Imposing heavy taxes now is akin to treating a weak patient with harsh medicine, leading to imminent demise. Factories in Henan province find it difficult to bear the existing consolidated tax and business tax. Adding this new tax will likely exceed their capacity, and other provinces likely share the same sentiment. We propose to jointly appeal to the government to show compassion and benefit industry and commerce by delaying implementation or reducing the tax rate before it is promulgated. This matter is of great importance to the future of industry and commerce. Your association, being widely respected nationwide, must have comprehensive plans. We urge you to provide detailed guidance to ensure unified action." It is understood that the association plans to submit this to a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members for further review.</p>

<p>Riri News reports that the second group of the National Guangdong College of Law Judicial Inspection Group, comprising twenty-four members led by Professor He Xueji, arrived in Shanghai a few days ago aboard the China Merchants Bureau's Hai Zhen steamer and is staying at the Guangdong East Middle School. The group has already visited Mayor Wu in the city center and inspected new construction. Yesterday, they visited the First and Second Special District Courts and prison facilities. Today, after visiting various cultural institutions, they will travel north to Nanjing, Jinan, Qingdao, Hankou, and other places to continue their inspection.

<h3 id="e132">Ministry of Finance Informs Shanghai Municipal Government That Expropriated Land Should Be Exempt from Taxes Immediately <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Land Already Expropriated But Not Yet Exempt Should Be Cleared Up Promptly. Taxes Already Collected Should Be Refunded in Full.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government recently received a communication from the Ministry of Finance stating that, in accordance with General Chiang Kai-shek's telegram from the Qin Military Commission, it is imperative to give land prices and tax exemptions for the expropriation of people's land for road construction in various provinces, so as to respect private rights and interests. However, in recent years, various localities have faced financial difficulties, and issuing land prices may not be possible immediately. Exempting land taxes is easier and should be implemented in advance to demonstrate consideration for the people's livelihood while developing transportation. If land has been expropriated but land taxes are still required to be paid, it is forcing people to fulfill obligations they should not have to, which is detrimental to their livelihood. In the future, when constructing roads and expropriating private land, the area of expropriated land, the amount of tax, and the names of the owners should be thoroughly investigated and measured by the county government within three months of land use. A clear list should be compiled and reported to the provincial government, which should then submit it to the Ministry for verification. In the meantime, the land taxes and various surcharges should be temporarily suspended. Once the Ministry's approval is received, the exemption should be granted. Land expropriated previously that has not yet been exempted from taxes should also be cleared up promptly according to the same procedure. This instruction has been sent to the provincial governments in the bandit suppression areas for compliance. A special telegram has been sent for your information. Signed, Chiang Kai-shek, etc. Having received this, and noting that regulations for the exemption of taxes for highway land use in various provinces and cities have been jointly formulated, submitted to the National Government, approved, and promulgated for implementation, the Ministry has carefully reviewed the matter and proposes three practical measures for tax exemption: (1) For private land that has been expropriated but not yet exempted from taxes, the expropriating agency should promptly clear it up and submit a list to the Ministry for verification and exemption. Taxes already collected should be refunded in full according to the verified list, starting from the date of expropriation, upon presentation of receipts by the original owner. Collection should be suspended during the period of list verification and submission. (2) For private land currently being expropriated, a list should be compiled and submitted to the Ministry for verification and exemption, with collection suspended in the meantime. (3) For private land to be expropriated in the future, a list should be compiled and submitted to the Ministry for verification and exemption as soon as the expropriation is approved, so that tax exemption can be granted upon implementation of the expropriation. In addition to telegraphing the General Headquarters, notifications have been sent to the provincial and municipal governments for compliance. Accordingly, this is communicated for your information.</p>

<p>Yangtze River Steamer Police Dogs Inspect for Opium Strictly Prohibit Stewards from Selling Privately Passengers Not Allowed to Smoke</p>
<p>The central government is strictly enforcing the ban on opium, and the entire country is working actively to eradicate it within a specified period. However, river steamers, being mobile on the water, continue to sell and smoke opium openly, as if nothing is happening. Now, opium suppression agencies have also started to strictly inspect waterways and commercial shipments, and are using police dogs to assist. They have already solved several cases. Starting with Yangtze River steamers, the sale and smoking of opium will be strictly prohibited, and shipping companies have been asked to assist. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Yangtze River Steamers Selling and Smoking: Yangtze River steamers have long been a source of private opium smuggling. Since Shanghai strictly enforced inspections, Yangtze River steamers have become wary of carrying opium. However, stewards on foreign-flagged ships still privately sell opium and provide smoking equipment for passengers to purchase, and they still smuggle private opium to various ports when disembarking. This severely hinders the future of opium suppression. Therefore, the opium suppression inspection team is strictly inspecting Yangtze River steamers and has already begun practical trials to fundamentally eliminate the source of private opium and the sale of smoking equipment on Yangtze River steamers.</p>
<p>Police Dog Inspection: The Capital Opium Suppression Inspection Team, punished by the fact that stewards on Yangtze River steamers use all sorts of tricks to hide opium very secretly, making it difficult to detect even when they are carrying it, Team Leader Dong Lianghan and others have specially trained a police dog inspection team to be responsible for searching Yangtze River steamers. The method involves having police dogs board the steamers and go to various rooms and cabins, using their sense of smell to search, which is twice as effective as human searches. Even if opium is hidden secretly, it will eventually be detected by the police dogs. This team has already used police dogs to solve a case on a Yangtze River steamer, and both the perpetrator and the evidence have been seized.</p>
<p>Seizure of Private Opium: When the police dog squad in Nanjing was testing the inspection of opium on Yangtze River steamers, the China Merchants Bureau's Jiangxin steamer, which was traveling from Hankou, arrived in Beijing. Team Leader Dong Lianghan and Squad Leader Zhou Jingqing led several police dogs to board the steamer for a search. At first, they found nothing, but when they reached a first-class cabin, the police dogs suddenly barked wildly at the cabin door. Squad Leader Zhou Jingqing ordered the steward in charge of the cabin to open the door. Upon inspection, nothing suspicious was found. However, the police dogs sniffed out opium hidden inside the cabin's false wall. Upon being dismantled, over thirty taels of private opium, numerous prepared opium paste, and a complete set of opium smoking equipment were found. The police dogs then sniffed out the opium smuggler, and steward Jiang Zhengdao was apprehended. After interrogation, it was confirmed that he was the smuggler. He was immediately handed over to the court for prosecution.</p>
<p>Shipping Bureau Strictly Prohibits: After this case occurred, the China Merchants Bureau received a report from the team, and Liu Hongsheng inquired with the captain of the Jiangxin steamer and learned that it was smuggled by the steward. In addition to reforming the Yangtze River steamer steward system, strictly registering them, and dismissing those with bad behavior, the General Bureau issued a notice and posted it on all of its Yangtze River steamers: (1) Stewards and others on the ship are strictly prohibited from carrying contraband. Violators will be prosecuted without leniency. (2) Smoking opium on the ship is prohibited. Passengers are not allowed to bring their own opium smoking equipment. (3) This prohibition and the enforcement measures will be posted in all cabins.</p>

<p>Reduce Travel Time...Change to Once Every Ten Days...Annual Increase of 24 Trips...Additional Revenue of Over 700,000</p>
<p>Since its inaugural voyage, the China Merchants Bureau's Xinhai steamer has been enjoying excellent business due to its low ticket prices and excellent cabin accommodations. Hong Kong has now agreed to issue passenger licenses, a successful negotiation thanks to the determination of General Manager Shen Jiyun, setting a precedent in Chinese shipping. This is not only important to national dignity, but it also reclaims a significant amount of shipping rights. The Bureau is now determined to develop and increase the number of voyages, which could result in an annual surplus of several hundred thousand yuan. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong Vessel Inspection</p>
<p>From July 1st, the Hong Kong government has recognized that Chinese ships can obtain Hong Kong passenger licenses, and Chinese shipowners no longer need to undergo examinations. The China Merchants Bureau's Haiheng, Haili, and Haizhen steamers could have sold Hong Kong passenger tickets when traveling from Shanghai to Hong Kong. However, to ensure the safety of the voyage, these three steamers did not sell Hong Kong tickets on their voyage to Hong Kong. Instead, upon arriving in Hong Kong, they requested the Hong Kong Port Authority to board and inspect the ships and apply to the Hong Kong authorities for passenger licenses. Hong Kong passenger tickets can only be sold after these licenses are obtained. Therefore, these three ships must return to Shanghai before they can sell Hong Kong tickets.</p>
<p>Passenger Support</p>
<p>Since the price of first, second, and third-class tickets on the Sihai steamer was reduced, the number of passengers has exceeded expectations. The ships have been almost fully booked on every voyage. In the past half month, when these ships left Shanghai, latecomers could not even buy tickets. The same was true for those coming to Shanghai from Guangdong and Shantou. Therefore, the revenue from passenger tickets on the Sihai steamer has exceeded the expected amount. Recently, each round trip of the Sihai steamer to Nanhua generates over 7,600 to 7,700 yuan in passenger ticket revenue alone. Before the ships even enter port, there is already a rush to book cabins.</p>
<p>Increase Voyages</p>
<p>Currently, each round trip of the Sihai steamer to Nanhua, Shantou, Hong Kong, Xiamen, and Guangdong takes approximately twelve and a half days. However, in reality, this much time is not needed. The ships often arrive in port ahead of schedule. Recognizing the excellent business and high revenue on this route, and that the ships can travel faster, the Bureau has decided to shorten the Sihai steamer's travel time to once every ten days. This would allow for at least two additional voyages per month, or twenty-four additional voyages per year. Each voyage would generate at least 30,000 yuan in cargo and passenger revenue, which would result in an annual increase of 720,000 yuan. Operating expenses would remain the same, with only a slight increase in fuel consumption.</p>
<p>Implementation Plan</p>
<p>The additional voyages of the Sihai steamer will generate a significant amount of freight revenue annually, which will be more than sufficient to cover the payment of Boxer Indemnity principal and interest. Therefore, General Manager Liu Hongsheng has instructed Chief of Business Section He Molin, General Manager Shen Jiyun, Chief of Shipbuilding Section, and others to discuss and implement the increase in voyages of the four new steamers as soon as possible. The chiefs are already revising the routes and layover times of the four ships and discussing ways to shorten the sea voyage. Once a comprehensive plan is developed, it will be implemented soon. It is expected to be realized in the near future.</p>

<h3 id="e137">Continued Hearing of the Madame Cheng Li Tianzhi vs. Xu Yi Case Yesterday's Interrogation Concludes with Official Order for Xu Yi's Detention <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Cheng Li Tianzhi, the wife of the owner of the Chinese Gentai Cooperative Factory, recently filed a complaint with the procuratorate of the local court against Xu Yi, a Guangdong native currently working as a lawyer, accusing him of forging a legal counsel agreement and defrauding her of 20,000 taels, plus interest, totaling 27,000 taels. After a clear investigation by Prosecutor Li Fen, Xu Yi was ordered to be released on bail pending further proceedings. These details were previously reported. It is now known that Prosecutor Li has formally indicted Xu Yi on charges of forgery and other crimes, stating that the defendant Xu Yi is suspected of violating Articles 224, 234, Paragraphs 1 and 2, and 363, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law. Due to the gravity of the offenses and the interconnectedness of the crimes, the punishment should be increased in accordance with Article 74 of the same law. The case stems from an unexpected letter sent by Xu Yi to Cheng Li Tianzhi in October of last year, claiming that she had retained him as her legal counsel for one year in October 1932, with a fixed fee of 20,000 taels, and that the principal and interest totaled approximately 37,000 taels. He demanded that Cheng Li Tianzhi settle the matter promptly. He also forged the legal counsel agreement signed by Cheng Li Tianzhi, which he admitted to writing himself in court. After the agreement was written, Gentai Factory Manager Li Quanshen took it to Cheng's house with him to be stamped, and the Gentai Factory acted as guarantor, affixing the Gentai Factory's seal and letterhead. When questioned, Cheng Li Tianzhi denied ever retaining legal counsel or affixing her seal. Li Quanshen also denied any knowledge of the matter and claimed that Xu Yi had worked at the Gentai Factory for over two years, starting in February 1931, handling documents. The Gentai Factory's seal and letterhead on the agreement were stolen at the time. If Gentai had indeed acted as guarantor, with whom was the agreement made? Given that Xu Yi had previously held a position handling legal documents at the factory, he had the opportunity to take and use the seal. Therefore, Li Quanshen's claim that Xu Yi stole it can be believed. Furthermore, Cheng Li Tianzhi did not personally sign the agreement, and there is no other concrete evidence to prove the authenticity of the seal. It can be confirmed that Cheng Li Tianzhi is a woman, and all external affairs are handled by her husband. There is no need for her to retain legal counsel. The case was heard yesterday morning at 11:00 am in the Tenth Court by Judge Tan. Cheng Li Tianzhi, accompanied by her lawyers Li Shirui and Li Shaopeng, testified, stating that she is 51 years old, from Ningbo, and resides on Jing'an Temple Road. "I usually rely on signatures. I have never had this oval seal. Did you retain Xu Yi as your legal counsel?" She replied, "Everything is handled by my husband. There is no need for legal counsel. Also, our family follows the traditional family system. Even if there were a contract, the family would have a secretary." "Do you have any familial relationship with Xu Yi?" She replied, "Xu Yi is my sister's son-in-law. He is married to my younger sister's daughter." Next, Li Quanshen testified that he is 46 years old and did not guarantee the legal counsel fee. Because Xu Yi is a relative, he allowed him to work at the Gentai Factory. He said, "The Gentai Factory's seal was always kept by me. Later, I was unable to take care of it, so I entrusted it to the accountant surnamed Ye. I asked Xu Yi to help take care of everything. Now, the accountant surnamed Ye has also fled. As for Xu Yi, after he came out of school, I thought of our kinship and let him handle documents and work as a clerk at the factory." Finally, Xu Yi testified that he is 30 years old, from Zhongshan, Guangdong, and is currently a lawyer. The prosecutor's indictment states that the defendant guaranteed the factory's affairs, but in reality, the defendant has nothing to do with the factory. The defendant usually works in his office. "Why didn't Cheng Li Tianzhi sign the agreement?" He replied, "She is illiterate, so she did not sign but affixed her seal. In law, this has the same effect." By this point, it was past noon. The judge adjourned the hearing and ordered Xu Yi to be detained. Xu Yi immediately requested to remain released on bail, stating that as a lawyer, he would not flee. The judge said that the circumstances of the case are serious, and although it was permitted, he ordered the bailiff to take him into custody pending further notice.</p>
<h3 id="e138">New Material for Amazing Sights Past and Present A Miraculous Tale of a Broken Mirror Rejoined <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Deng Tonghui, a 24-year-old from Huzhou, comes from a wealthy family. His wife, Chen Peilan, is also from a prominent local family. They are both in their prime and have been married for two years. Their love has always been strong. Last year, Deng came to Shanghai to do business. With ample free time and being young and carefree, he frequented dance halls and spent lavishly without restraint. He attracted a following of flatterers. This spring, his wife learned of his activities in their hometown and rushed to Shanghai, hoping to live with him and劝谏 him. Unexpectedly, Deng, being young and headstrong, felt that being controlled by his wife would be embarrassing. The more she 劝谏, the more indulgent he became. Arguments became frequent, and their feelings gradually cooled. Deng's temper also became rough, often physically abusing Peilan. His wife, greatly angered, returned to her mother's home and filed for divorce in court, demanding a one-time payment of 50,000 yuan for alimony. Deng also hired lawyer Bao Sheng to file a counterclaim, claiming that Peilan suffered from a hidden illness that prevented her from bearing children, making it impossible for them to live together as husband and wife. Both sides held firm to their positions, and the lawsuit dragged on for half a year without resolution. Recently, news of a reconciliation emerged. Reporters repeatedly inquired with relevant parties to uncover the truth behind the broken mirror rejoined. Initially, after Deng came to Shanghai, he was romantic and loved to dance. He became infatuated with a dancer named Fengmei and soon had a physical relationship with her. Due to his promiscuity, Deng contracted gonorrhea, a very mild case that he did not care about. Peilan's hidden illness was actually transmitted by Deng. Deng later used this as a ground to attack his wife, which was a malicious accusation. After the lawsuit began, Deng became even more unrestrained, indulging in extravagant pleasures every night. The gonorrhea he contracted worsened, and his physical strength gradually declined. Suffering from the illness, he realized the inappropriateness of his past behavior and repented, vowing to reform himself. However, months of medical treatment were ineffective. Disheartened, he contemplated suicide. Fortunately, he finally received guidance from a famous doctor and purchased and took a safe and effective medicine. Within a month, his illness was gone. Overjoyed, he remembered his former love for his wife and went to her home, begging for forgiveness. Peilan had no malicious intent towards Deng and inquired about what had happened. In the end, Deng expressed his infinite gratitude towards Le Duneng. His wife was pleasantly surprised to hear that Peilan also took Le Duneng to treat her gonorrhea, which was completely cured with just one box. Deng's case was more severe, but it was also completely cured with a specially formulated medicine, Le Duneng. It was an unexpected coincidence. As a result, both sides withdrew their lawsuits and reconciled as before. (Editor's note: Le Duneng effectively cures gonorrhea, and its efficacy is unmatched by ordinary gonorrhea medicines. Le Duneng not only acted as a peacemaker in the Deng couple's reunion, but also played a crucial role in bringing them back together. It is truly a remarkable story.)</p>

<p>Since the beginning of summer, the national weather has been unpredictable, with rampant epidemics. All local epidemic hospitals have reported being full, with later arrivals unable to be accommodated. Doctors have been very busy, giving one or two boxes of Golden Dragon Supreme Oil to those with milder conditions, instructing them to take it at home. As a result, those with quick minds have rushed to buy and take it themselves. For a time, all cigarette shops and pharmacies were unable to meet the demand. At the same time, the Shanghai Supreme Company's competition sales method in the New World spread rapidly. The whole of Shanghai was immediately stirred up, because the oil, which usually sold for three dollars for fifty packets, was now selling for only one dollar, or just two cents per box. Given its extraordinary efficacy and the fact that the supreme oil governing all diseases was sold at such a low price, the New World shopping center has recently been crowded with people, seven or eight out of ten of whom went there to buy Supreme Oil. In particular, general economic philanthropists spend two or three dollars to buy large quantities and give them to friends and relatives. It is said that the oil is exclusively managed in this port by the New Star Pharmacy at 57 Hankou Road, Shanghai. Please call 91979, and it can be delivered to your door immediately, without delivery fee.</p>

<p>Wang Jincai, thirty-three years old, from Nantong, has been a traveling salesman for the Xiangyu Hardware Store on Xihua Road. At the end of last month, due to decreased appetite and weak limbs, he took leave to recuperate at his brother Jinsheng's house on Bazhi Road. The previous morning, his stomach pain became severe. He heard someone say that opium could relieve stomach pain, so he went to the nearby den of vice to ask for some. As he was leaving, he suddenly saw a large group of detectives coming with great momentum. Jincai's face immediately turned ashen, and he stood as still as a wooden chicken. The detectives saw that he was holding a paper package and looked flustered, so they searched him and found opium residue, assuming he was a member of the underworld. They intended to take him to the police station. Jincai vehemently denied it. At that time, Jinsheng also arrived after hearing the news, and together with nearby shopkeepers, they provided proof and explanation, and he was released. Onlookers were like a wall. Someone who knew him told Jincai, "You only need to buy 'Unique Spiritual' medicine pills from the pharmacy and take them. I guarantee it will relieve your pain and improve your appetite." Jincai immediately bought and took "Unique Spiritual," and sure enough, the medicine worked wonders, and he was endlessly grateful.</p>

<p>The weather in this port has been erratic for the past ten days, with alternating sunshine and rain, and varying temperatures. When sleeping at night, it is necessary to cover oneself with a thin quilt. Unexpectedly, the wind direction suddenly changed yesterday morning, and a northwest wind came slowly. Therefore, upon waking up, it immediately felt unusually stuffy and hot. The room was very humid, and the sunlight was sometimes visible and sometimes obscured, making people feel physically and mentally uncomfortable. The Fahrenheit thermometer rose to 91.4 degrees. Therefore, after nightfall, most people were cooling off by the roadside and in the alleys.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Indian Banaji's Feat of Walking the World Has Arrived in Shanghai from Bengal <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The Zi Lin Newspaper reported that Indian Banaji, age thirty-three, set out from Bengal in 1933 on the feat of walking around the world. He arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. According to his account of his journey, after passing through India, he arrived at Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan. Because the Afghans and Persians started a political dispute, he was forced to turn back. Later, he arrived in Rangoon and switched to cycling to Hong Kong, passing through Myanmar, Penang, and Singapore, and then taking a steamer to Hong Kong. He plans to take a route through Nanjing, Beijing, Shenyang, and Korea to Japan in two weeks. Mr. Banaji said yesterday that it is surprising that this great country does not have accessible highways. He has encountered hundreds of miles without roads on his journey. This is only the beginning. As for whether he will go to Vladivostok and Moscow after arriving at the port, because he can cycle there, it is feared that the authorities will not allow it. To take the route through the United States, it is of course necessary to go through many waterways. Mr. Banaji has been robbed no less than five times on his journey, losing everything. The first time was the most serious, encountering tribes specializing in raiding in the wilderness on the way to Kabul, and being imprisoned in a village. Fortunately, a British soldier's team searching for a lost companion passed through the village and released him. When a reporter asked about the purpose of his world tour, Mr. Banaji replied that he plans to closely investigate the economic and social conditions of the countries he passes through, believing that this is the best way to obtain such information. Mr. Banaji is currently staying at the Indian Temple on Baoshan Road, waiting to decide whether to cycle along the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou highway or take a train directly to Beijing, and then plans to leave Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e144">The Bureau of Weights and Measures; Re-inspected Measuring Instruments Yesterday Morning; Director Zhou Ziming Attended and Supervised the Inspection; A Total of More Than 200 Measuring Instruments Were Inspected <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The Bureau of Weights and Measures of this city started inspecting the measuring instruments of rice shops at the Rice Shop Guild at approximately 9:00 AM yesterday morning. Director Zhou Ziming personally went to supervise the inspection. A total of more than 200 pieces were inspected. It is scheduled to inspect measuring instruments in Pudong and other places this morning. The details are reported as follows:</p>
<p>Start Inspection</p>
<p>Because the measuring instruments of various rice shops in the territory are chaotic and in need of re-inspection, the bureau specially dispatched commissioners Cai Kexing and others to start inspecting the measuring instruments of various rice shops in the area of Gaochang Temple at the Rice Shop Trade Association in Danfeng Building, Xinkaihe, Nanshi, starting at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. The "sheng" and "dou" were calibrated with rice, and the "he" was calibrated with water. Those that meet the standards will be issued a certificate of conformity by the bureau, and a hard seal will be stamped on the bottom of the instrument. Those that do not meet the standards will be immediately instructed to hire a coppersmith to re-solder them. It is stipulated that they will be inspected again the next day. If they are still unusable, they will be ordered to be destroyed and not allowed to be used again. The work was stopped at approximately 4:00 PM, with a total of more than 200 measuring instruments inspected. It is heard that the association will uniformly assign numbers to all members, regardless of membership (on a per-store basis). In the future, old "sheng" and "dou" and copper "sheng" and "dou" will no longer be allowed to be used, and all will be replaced with zinc measuring instruments.</p>
<p>Director Supervision</p>
<p>Director Zhou Ziming of the bureau considered this re-inspection to be of utmost importance. In order to handle it seriously, he personally went to the association to supervise the inspection at approximately 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon. The entire executive committee of the association, Lu Wenshao, Zhang Nianxuan, Shi Hongdong, Zhang Pinhua, and more than 20 others, cordially received him. Director Zhou then inspected the inspection procedures for two hours, and returned to the bureau with his staff at approximately 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Collecting Measuring Instruments</p>
<p>The area stipulated by the bureau of inspection and the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs for the association to inspect the measuring instruments of its members and non-members has been decided by the executive committee of the association. In addition to dispatching several staff members to assist the inspectors yesterday morning, it also assigned several members to go to the area of Lan Nidu in Pudong and the riverside area in Puxi to collect more than 80 measuring instruments from various rice shops. It is learned that there are more than 10,000 measuring instruments in rice shops throughout the city, and it is estimated that the inspection period will take at least fifty days to complete.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Socialite Fu Jingqing; Accused of Abusing a Maid; Medical Examination Proves the Adopted Daughter's Injuries; Fu Posts Bail and Awaits Trial <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Zhen'er, a Sichuan girl, thirteen years old, was told by a woman in her hometown last year that she could be brought to Shanghai for employment and receive generous wages. The girl's mother believed it to be true, so she handed the girl over to the woman, who took her out and sold her for seven yuan. She then brought her to Shanghai to be raised and used. Recently, she was resold to Fu Jingqing, a Sichuanese woman (also known as Wen Hao, thirty-two years old), who lives at No. 29, Ya'erbei Lane, Ya'erbei Road, French Concession, and works as a female admirer in the Shanghai Film Company (also known as Ms. AA, a well-known socialite in Shanghai), to be a maid. Later, Fu's sister returned to Sichuan and resold the girl to Fu Jingqing as a servant for twenty yuan. At first, they were at peace, but recently Fu Jingqing often beat the girl because she was careless in her work and did not clean the clothes properly. At approximately 9:00 AM on the 8th of this month, Fu beat the girl again because she did not clean the pillowcase properly. She first beat her with a wooden stick, and then whipped her body with a feather duster, leaving bruises all over. The girl fled to the road, wandering and crying. She was found by Chinese Constable No. 159 and Vietnamese Constable No. 207 of the French Police Station, who inquired about the details and took the girl to the police station. After the head of the police station questioned her, he sent the girl to Guangci Hospital, where the injuries were confirmed to be real. He then sent detective Zhang Bingcheng to arrest Fu Jingqing. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Police Station Lawyer Yao Zhao stated the case and prosecuted her for the crime of injury under Article 277 of the new Criminal Law. Then, the victim, Zhang Zhen'er, testified about the circumstances of the beating, and said that she now requested to be sent back to her hometown in Sichuan. When questioned, the defendant, Fu Jingqing, said that the girl was the adopted daughter of my sister, and was temporarily staying with me because my sister returned to Sichuan. She also hired a lawyer to defend her. Judge Shu Chang ordered a postponement to the 12th, and ordered that the victim be sent to the forensic department for examination of the injuries before further questioning. The defendant was ordered to post a 500-yuan store guarantee. The defendant was introduced by her brother to a Russian doctor ten years ago to quit smoking. As a result, she was drugged with medicated cigarettes by the Russian doctor and stole thousands of dollars in cash. She was involved in litigation at the former French Concession Public Trial, which was published in various newspapers and caused a sensation.</p>
<h3 id="e146">The Trial of the Dongjiadu Ferry Accident Concluded; Sentencing Scheduled for the 5th <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Zhao Jintao, the owner of a ferryboat at the Dongjiadu Wharf in Nanshi, sailed to Pudong with passengers at 6:20 AM on June 4th. When approaching the Pudong Wharf, it was hit by the Chunhua Steamer, causing many deaths by drowning. The Water Police arrested Zhao and the boat crew, Huang Yonghua, and others, and sent them to the District Court for questioning and detention. The details have been reported previously. It is now known that Zhao Jintao was carrying as many as twenty-five passengers that day (the Public Works Bureau stipulates that large boats can carry twenty passengers and small boats can carry fifteen passengers). The steering was inevitably sluggish. At that time, the ferry was sailing approximately five or six zhang away from the Pudong Wharf when it encountered the Chunhua Steamer sailing south. The steamer immediately sounded its horn to warn the ferry to stop moving forward. Zhao Jintao and others ignored the warning and instead steered forward forcefully, causing the disaster. All the people on the boat fell into the water. In addition to rescuing twenty people, including Tao Linxiang, five people drowned, including Qiu Xueyu and the woman Zhu Gongshi. Their bodies were recovered one after another, and their families identified them and provided coffins. The bodies of three others have not yet been found. Prosecutor Zhao Fujia, who was handling the case, has completed the investigation and filed a lawsuit with the Criminal Court in accordance with the law. At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, Judge Shao Qinzhi opened the trial. First, it was stated that Zhu Gongshi, who had died, suffered a tragic death due to Zhao Jintao's negligent driving. The victim had been suffering from illness for many years and had an elderly mother above her, relying entirely on the victim's wife to sell paper ingots to earn a living. Now that she has died tragically, the victim's family has lost their support. It is requested that compensation be sought for clothing, coffin, funeral, and compensation expenses, etc. Next, Qiu Huilin testified that he was fifty-four years old, from Suzhou, and that the deceased Qiu Xueyu was his son. The ferry company has already given me compensation and coffin burial expenses, so I do not want to be involved in the lawsuit. Zhao Jintao testified that he was thirty-seven years old, from Shanghai, and that his ferry had already sailed close to the Pudong Wharf when the Chunhua Steamer did not follow the nautical route, causing the disaster. It had nothing to do with my ferry, and I was unwilling to pay compensation. Huang Yonghua testified that he was sixty-six years old, from Shanghai, and that his testimony was the same as Zhao Jintao's. At this point, Prosecutor Zhao was invited to the court to present his opinion. Then, Wang Dachun, the lawyer hired by Zhu Yangsi as the private prosecutor's agent, stated that the expenses for Zhu Gongshi's clothing, coffin, salvage, etc., were approximately 200 yuan. Zhu Gongshi could earn more than 30 yuan per month. Now, at a minimum of 20 yuan per month, please pursue 2,400 yuan calculated over ten years. The total is 2,600 yuan. The judge considered the hearing to be concluded and scheduled the sentencing for the 15th of this month. The defendants were returned to custody to await instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Inmate Throws Feces in Jail; Provoked by Using Too Much Tap Water and Quarrel With Guard; Sentenced to Three Months in Prison for Resentful Feces Throwing <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Wang Desheng, from Zhenjiang, twenty-six years old, was arrested by the French Police Station and transferred to the Second Special District Court in May for a prisoner robbery case, and was sentenced to three years and two months in prison. He was confirmed and sent to the Second Special District Prison on Masinan Road to serve his sentence. On the 5th of this month, Wang committed the act of washing his feet at the tap water faucet. When Guard Zhang Chongyou caught sight of Wang's wasteful use of tap water, he stepped forward to stop him. The inmate was not convinced, resulting in a conflict. The guard immediately reported the information to his superior officer, who punished Wang. Wang then transferred his anger to Guard Zhang Chongyou. The next day, Wang was working in the factory. Taking advantage of Guard Zhang's unpreparedness, Wang threw a package of pre-prepared feces at Zhang's head and face, causing Zhang's face, mouth, nose, and clothes to be stained with gold. Zhang was enraged and reported to the warden that Wang's lawlessness was extreme. After the warden sent Wang to the French Police Station for investigation, he was transferred to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court yesterday morning. Judge Shu Chang brought him in for interrogation. Police Station Lawyer Yao Zhao Di stated the case and prosecuted him for the crime of insulting a public official in the course of his duties under Article 140 of the new Criminal Law. When questioned, Wang Desheng testified that because he saw other inmates washing clothes and hair at the tap, he also went up to wash his feet. When Guard Zhang came, the others had already run away. He asked me who had opened the faucet, and I replied that I did not know. He went to report to the section chief. I confessed to him and begged for mercy, but he refused and instead cuffed me for eight hours and confined me in a dark cell for two days and two nights, without seeing the light of day. I was angry for a moment, so I threw feces at him. Then, the plaintiff, Guard Zhang Chongyou, stated that tap water in the prison was originally available for anyone to use. Warden Sun, because the consumption has been increasing recently, stipulated opening times and locked the faucet with a lock. The defendant was washing his feet, and I asked him who had opened it. He didn't say, and said he would show me the consequences, so I reported to the section chief. The next day, he threw feces at me. At this point, the judge announced the start of arguments and then declared the conclusion. The court sentenced Wang Desheng to three months in prison for insulting a public official in the performance of his duties. After the sentence was pronounced, the defendant was taken away by the bailiff and returned to custody.</p>

<p>The home of Chen Buzhao, from Qingjiang, at No. 70, Fulu Lane, Yangshupu Road, was broken into on the evening of May 27 at approximately 11:00 PM. Valuables worth more than 400 yuan were robbed. Before escaping, the robbers fired a gun, seriously injuring Chen and causing his death. Zhang Zhongyang and Shi Jinzhu, who lived together, were also injured by gunshots. Liu Yulong, from Siyang, and Tang Bingguang, from Guangdong, the bandits in this case, hid in the French Concession. On the 12th of last month, they colluded with Chen Bao, from Changzhou, and Lin Changgen, from Shaoxing, to rob valuables from Fushunxiang Button Shop at No. 138, Ailaige Road, and were arrested. After questioning by the Second Special District Court, they were sentenced to various terms of imprisonment. Liu and the other four bandits were brought back to the Police Station by Chinese Detective Sun Afu and Detective Su Yinggen of the Yangshupu Police Station and sent to the First Special District District Court for questioning and detention. It was rescheduled for investigation of the group during the period from February 10 to March 5, when they ganged up and robbed the homes of Wang Daishi at No. 14, Xinzha Road, and Zhou Yinshi at No. 5, Zhoujiazui Road, of clothing and silver worth more than 700 yuan. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi opened the Third Criminal Court for investigation. Council Lawyer Wang Yaotang explained the previous situation. Then, victims Zhang Juyang, Shi Jinzhu, and the owners Wang Daishi and Zhou Yinshi testified about the circumstances at the time. The defendants' testimonies were ambiguous. The court ordered that they be returned to custody and scheduled sentencing.</p>

<p>Wang Ating, a Ningbo peddler who stayed at an inn, thirty-four years old, picked up a pawn ticket for a wireless radio on the road a few days ago. The ticket stated that the pawn amount was 21 yuan. Wang handed the ticket to Yu Renchu (thirty-three years old), a fellow villager who lived at No. 3, Guian Lane, Ailaige Road, and worked as a boat crew member, and entrusted him to sell it on his behalf. Yu handed the ticket over to Gong Wenlang (thirty-one years old), a detective from Yangzhou, No. 175, French Police Station, who lived at No. 94, Huanghe Road, and agreed to redeem it, value it, and give him the ticket price. Gong agreed that if the machine was a high-quality item after redemption, he would give him five yuan for the original pawn ticket price. Gong then prepared the principal and interest on the morning of the 8th and went to Fuhe Pawnshop at No. 427, intersection of Bubo Road and Beile Road to redeem it, totaling 21 yuan and 8 jiao in principal and interest. Unexpectedly, after redeeming it and inspecting the goods, although it was a five-tube machine, it was of inferior quality, and now it was worth more than ten yuan on the market. Gong then requested that the machine be pawned again at the original price, sacrificing the interest. However, the pawnshop clerk, Weng Guangtong, from Chaozhou, refused to allow it. Even if he reduced the price by half, he would not accept it. Gong immediately accused him of fraud, resulting in an argument. Later, Gong instructed Yu to report to the police station. After questioning by the head of the police station, because Gong was a public official and should not accept pawn tickets or embezzle lost property, he was first dismissed from his post and Wang Ating, who had first picked up the pawn ticket, was arrested and taken into custody together. Yesterday, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Police Station Lawyer Yao Zhao Di stated the case and requested a postponement for investigation. After Judge Shu Chang briefly questioned the defendants, he ordered a rescheduling for the 12th and the defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<p>The weather has been poor recently, with continuous rain, and slight carelessness in diet and daily life easily leads to illness. The Hudong area is home to a large number of laborers, so there are more epidemic sufferers. The Chinese Epidemic Hospital at the intersection of Huade Road and Tilanqiao has been open for more than half a month, providing day and night treatment without charge. Recently, the average number of people seeking treatment at the hospital has exceeded 300 per day. The number of people hospitalized for treatment is also large. The beds provided by the hospital are insufficient, and more than 100 have now been added. It is widely beneficial to the common people. The hospital was founded by philanthropists in Shanghai and exempts all expenses for diagnosis, treatment, medicine, and hospitalization for patients. It is also heard that the Beijing Road branch across from the Zhongfa Pharmacy and the Dongyouheng Road Tonghua Road intersection branch are also providing diagnosis and medication at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Shanghai Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory Shareholders' Meeting; Discusses the Formation of a Resumption Design Committee <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Textile Printing and Dyeing Company is a well-equipped textile printing and dyeing factory in this port. The printed and dyed cotton fabrics produced by the company are all spun, woven, printed, and dyed in-house. Over the years, its business has been very developed. Since the second half of last year, due to the impact of the market, financial stagnation has occurred, and this year it has entered a state of shutdown. On March 29th of this year, the company's shareholders' meeting resolved to resume work on April 10th. However, the planned plan could not be realized due to market conditions. The company's authorities believe that the textile printing and dyeing industry is an important foundation of the national economy. More than 5,000 employees rely on it for their livelihood when work is started. If work is suspended for a long time, it will not only result in the loss of shareholders' capital, but will also have a huge impact on the country and society. Therefore, an extraordinary shareholders' meeting was convened yesterday to discuss the resumption plan. More than 200 shareholders attended, including Yu Zhendong, Chen Xiaodie, Shen Zhongyi, and Zhang Zilian, and unanimously resolved to organize the company's resumption design committee, which was composed of three supervisors and one person elected from the shareholders' meeting. The three committees elected by the shareholders were Zhang Zilian, Jiang Zhonghe, and Wang Zixiang. The four committees elected by the board of directors and supervisors were Zhang Rongchu, Shen Zhongyi, Chen Xiaodie, and Zhou Zhiqing, and Zhang Zilian was elected as chairman. Zhang Zilian then stated the guidelines for the resumption design to the shareholders, saying that the company has been forced by various environmental pressures, resulting in today's situation. However, all the equipment and organization of the company can be called the most perfect textile printing and dyeing factory in the country. In this autumn of market downturn, there is no way out except to request government assistance. The government has always had good intentions in maintaining the national industry. The industrial and commercial mortgage loans and credit loans held this time are the only countermeasure to save the urgent needs of industry and commerce. The company's situation is very consistent with the relief regulations issued by the Ministry of Finance. Minister Kong, Vice Minister Xu, and various leaders of industry and commerce in this port are very eager to protect the company. It is hoped that all shareholders and employees will remain calm and wait for the government to find ways to provide relief. I am a shareholder and have been entrusted with important responsibilities by the conference, and I will do my best to ensure that the company resumes work, so that the national industry will not collapse due to individual disintegration, and the more than 5,000 employees will not harm society due to unemployment. Several routine cases were then discussed and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>On June 24th, the Customs received a tip that the diamonds of the China Diamond Polishing Company at No. 3, Lao Yong'an Street, were smuggled in without paying taxes. They immediately went to search the premises together with the police and found diamonds worth 300,000 yuan, which were sealed and stored in the police station. They also accused British citizens Gregory Changobote and Ibeck Gee, who were related to the company, in the British Consulate. Ibeck Gee is currently not in Shanghai. After questioning by Examiner Haines and the police court, the case was concluded a few days ago. Because the plaintiff could not prove that the diamonds seized were smuggled in, the two defendants were acquitted. The diamonds seized, worth 300,000 yuan, remain in place and will be dealt with after Ibeck Gee returns to China.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Railway Bureau Continues Improvement Plans: Rickshaw Project at Shanghai North Station <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>To improve passenger service, the Shanghai-Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration has implemented measures to regulate rickshaws serving passengers at Shanghai North Station. A system of ticket sales and boarding has been established, with the Samsung Rickshaw Company providing vehicles and handling the operations, as previously reported. Since the implementation of this system on July 1st, rickshaw pullers have been registered and wear yellow uniforms, making them easily identifiable to passengers. Passengers purchase rickshaw tickets (each with two parts) and are required to present the ticket to the puller only after reaching their designated destination. Passengers retain one part of the ticket for verification. Since passengers do not directly pay the pullers, the pullers can no longer engage in price gouging. Passengers generally praise these improvements. According to the bureau's previous practice, rickshaws entering the station were required to pay a license fee of 50 cents per month per vehicle. Now, 200 rickshaws are specially designated to serve passengers, and the bureau issues free licenses to these vehicles, reducing the burden on operators and pullers. The bureau sacrifices 2,400 yuan in revenue annually. It is reported that the bureau, considering the high cost of renting rickshaws for business use (12 cents per vehicle per day) plus the puller's wage of one yuan, plans to contact the Shanghai Municipal Council for assistance. The Council would issue special licenses for public rickshaw pullers and manufacture new-style vehicles specifically for passenger service, reducing costs. The current rickshaw fares would then be lowered. When hiring pullers in the future, priority would be given to existing pullers, so this measure would not negatively impact their livelihoods.</p>

<p>The British-owned Music Industries Company has been charging radio stations within China a copyright fee of 150 yuan per month per station, along with six other demands. The dispute remains unresolved. The American side continues to insist on its six demands. Radio stations in this city refused to broadcast recordings managed by the company—including Pathé, Brunswick, Victor, and Gaoting—starting on July 1st, and engaged lawyer Zhu Ya Kui to draft a rebuttal. The record company responded by reiterating its demands. Meanwhile, foreign broadcasters in Shanghai continued to play the recordings as usual. More than thirty radio stations in this city believe that prolonged delay is not a solution. They plan to resume broadcasting Pathé recordings immediately, arguing that the company's demands have no legal basis. If further disputes arise, they will negotiate resolutely. It is reported that the radio stations tested the broadcasts for one hour yesterday.</p>

Although the construction of various facilities, such as the swimming pool and dance floor, has been proceeding day and night, some parts are not yet completed. It has now been decided to postpone the opening for a few days, and another public announcement will be made. The facilities of the Sports Garden's swimming pool are superior to those of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Hongkou Swimming Pool. After its opening, it will be a good place for sports for citizens and students in the city center.</p>
<h3 id="e161">A Record of the Silk Industry Bank's Gathering <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Industry Bank on Hankou Road in this city has been operating for four years since its establishment in 1931. Through dedicated management, it has built a strong reputation, leading to increasing business and staff. Yesterday marked the third anniversary of the bank's establishment. The staff of the head office and local branches jointly organized a gathering at Xu Garden on Connaught Road in the evening to celebrate. In addition to more than a hundred bank employees, Ms. Zheng Xia of the Greater Shanghai Singing Society, Mr. Chen Jianchen of the China Harmonica Association, and others participated, creating a lively atmosphere. The dinner began at around 7:00 PM. During the meal, Mr. Wang Yansong, the bank's general manager, and Mr. Luo Qinghua, the deputy manager, delivered speeches, encouraging everyone to uphold the bank's spirit of serving society, to work hard, and to engage in beneficial self-cultivation and entertainment during their leisure time. As the dinner drew to a close, the bank staff, Mr. Chen of the China Harmonica Association, and the Greater Shanghai Music and Singing Society performed various entertainments to enhance the atmosphere. In particular, the "Black Man Dance" performed by Mr. Yu Songquan, who covered his entire body in charcoal, was so comical and absurd that people burst into laughter. Mr. Wang Yansong also sang a section from "Sitting in the Palace" as the grand finale. The event concluded with a raffle. Each colleague donated an item in advance, and then lots were drawn, essentially exchanging gifts. One particularly interesting moment was when Mr. Wang Yansong won a handbag containing a pair of men's and women's slippers, as if it were specially prepared for his frequent travels. Ms. Zhu Yaode won a live chicken, causing an uproar. Ms. Mao Xiachu won an item, which turned out to be the marble pen holder that she herself had donated, a remarkable coincidence. The gathering ended and people dispersed at around 11:00 PM.</p>

<p>The rickshaw pullers of the Shanghai Special District have been organized into a mutual aid association by the Municipal Council for more than ten months, and have collected 180,000 yuan in mutual aid fees. However, the accounts have not been made public, leading to dissatisfaction among the pullers. They convened a meeting of puller representatives at 6:00 PM yesterday, chaired by Chen Guoliang. The following resolutions were passed: (1) Demand that the Municipal Council mutual aid association publish the 180,000 yuan accounts; (2) The mutual aid association should be managed by the pullers themselves in labor-management cooperation, with representatives from the Municipal Council and municipal government agencies supervising; (3) Abolish rickshaw puller registration to prevent the unemployment of 20,000 pullers; (4) Chen Guoliang is responsible for handling the above matters, and if necessary, will petition the central government.</p>

Yesterday, Judge Wu Zehan held a hearing and ruled that all three defendants were not guilty.</p>
<h3 id="e164">American Petroleum Company Street Vendor Embezzles Funds <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Shi Guangyu, a native of Ningbo, was employed as a street vendor for the American Petroleum Company. Recently, a Westerner at the company, Mr. Mirishero, discovered that Shi had embezzled a large sum of 16,000 yuan in public funds. He reported the matter to the general patrol station, which ordered Chinese detective Wu Chunrong to arrest Shi. Yesterday morning, Shi was escorted to the First Special District Court's Criminal Tribunal. The police lawyer, Ru Baoquan, stated that the defendant had been embezzling since January of this year until the date of his arrest, totaling 16,000 yuan. The method used was private conversion. Since the investigation is not yet complete, he requested detention. The defendant, Shi Guangyu, testified that according to company practice, checks received from customers should not be delivered to the company before they are due. After receiving the checks, he deposited them in the Foch Road branch of the China Industrial Bank, but about 7,300 yuan was lost due to the bank's collapse. The court asked that assuming the money was lost as he said, then what was the rest of the sum used for? Shi replied that he was speculating in American public bonds and stocks which he lost. He engaged lawyer Ye Fu Kang to defend him. The judge of the Criminal Tribunal, Qian Hongye, reviewed the testimony and ordered that the case be re-examined at a later date. Shi posted a bail of 10,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Lin Chen, a woman from Ningbo, was 17 years old. Her father-in-law, Lin Zhongzhen, worked as a comprador in a warehouse in Pudong, so her family also lived in Zhangjiabang nearby. Recently, she suddenly suffered severe headaches and abdominal pain. To facilitate treatment, she returned to her mother's home in Ningbo a few days ago (currently residing at No. 14, Lane 689, Zhaofeng Road). Despite seeing doctors multiple times, her condition did not improve. On the day before yesterday, unable to endure the pain, she suddenly conceived a pessimistic thought and secretly swallowed opium to commit suicide. Her father, Chen Cai Zhao, discovered her groaning in bed. She was rushed to Renji Hospital, but treatment was ineffective, and she soon died. The hospital reported the incident to the Jiaxing Road police station, which ordered detective Zhang Desheng to investigate. The body was transported to the Fei Lun Road morgue. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, arrived to examine the body. The examination confirmed that Lin Chen had died from opium poisoning. The body was released to her father-in-law, Lin Zhongzhen, for burial.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Fire on Guoging Road in Zhabei Claims Another Life Yesterday <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The chicken and duck shop opened by Su Asheng at No. 51 East Guoging Road in Zhabei caught fire the day before yesterday morning, resulting in three deaths and injuries, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It has now been learned that Su Rendi, the adopted daughter-in-law who was burned in the fire, died at Baolong Hospital at around 4:00 AM yesterday due to severe injuries. The hospital notified the Xin Zha branch, which dispatched local officer Shen Xiaowu to report to the Shanghai District Court for examination. The body was transported to the Fei Lun Road morgue in Hongkou for examination. In the morning and afternoon, prosecutors from the First Special District Court and the Shanghai District Court arrived to conduct the examination and fill out the coroner's report. The body was handed over to the local officer, with instructions for the deceased's parents-in-law to prepare a coffin for burial. It is also reported that the shop owner, Su Asheng, and his wife, Su Li, were the first to escape and were unharmed. Reports stating that the chicken and duck shop was opened by Li Chao Kui from Jiangbei are completely false. Li Chao Kui is actually a police officer stationed at Post 21 of the Wuzhen Road police station of the Xin Zha branch, and was on duty when the fire broke out that night.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Handcart Operators Oppose Increased Taxes; Preparatory Committee for Mutual Aid Association Established; First Meeting Held Yesterday and Declaration Issued <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The handcart operators within the concession have established a preparatory committee for the Shanghai Handcart Operators Mutual Aid Association to oppose the Municipal Council's tax increase. The first meeting was held at the Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, with more than 80 people attending. Chaired by Shen Yong, the meeting resolved: (1) To elect Shen Yong, Zou Shisong, Yang Chunfu, Wu Zhengyuan, and Chen Baoshan as standing committee members; Zhang Baobao, Cheng Zhongdao, and Gao Youyu as general affairs; Ye Wenhua, Ke Huaxing, and Wu Guocai as propaganda; Zhang Wenyuan, Bian Longbiao, and Ding Hongshan as investigation; Cui Hexiang, Qiu Miaosheng, Zhu Miaogen, and Jiang Ade as registration; (2) To solicit members to be handled by the propaganda, investigation, and registration sections; (3) Preparatory expenses will be temporarily covered by the organizers; (4) The association's location will be handled by the general affairs section; (5) To issue a declaration opposing the increased taxes on handcarts. The declaration stated: "Our handcart industry relies on physical strength to transport goods for customers, working hard to earn a meager living. Since the rise of mechanized transportation, such as trucks, our business has been plundered, and our lives have become increasingly difficult. The economic downturn that has swept through Shanghai, coupled with last year's drought and the resulting rural bankruptcy, has led to a decline in the entire market. As a result, passenger and freight transportation has decreased significantly. This is a common suffering faced by the entire transportation industry, and especially by our handcart industry. At a time when all industries are sluggish, the citizens of Shanghai are seeking to reduce rents and taxes. Unexpectedly, the Vehicle Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council in the Public Concession, disregarding the difficulties of the times, has resolved to increase taxes on our handcarts by more than double starting this autumn. The new tax on our handcarts is 5.15 yuan, a shocking increase. The cost of a handcart is at most 20 yuan. The amount of tax increased by the Municipal Council, calculated over the four seasons of the year, actually exceeds the cost of the handcart. This is the ultimate oppression of hard labor. The Municipal Council of the Concession is the highest administrative body in the Special District and bears the responsibility for social order. At a time when the market is in a slump, it should reduce taxes to alleviate commercial hardship. Instead, it has intensified its efforts, imposing exorbitant taxes on us laborers, which is tantamount to putting our handcart industry to death. Driven by livelihood, the operators cannot tolerate the Municipal Council's decision to increase taxes. In addition to organizing a mutual aid association to concentrate our strength and express our firm opposition, we have also sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Concession to argue our case based on reason. We hope that people from all walks of life will provide us with their sympathy and assistance. We sincerely thank you for this declaration."</p>
<h3 id="e169">Thirteenth Aviation Lottery Ticket Sales Brisk <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>The lottery draw for the 13th Aviation Highway Construction Lottery Ticket is scheduled to be held publicly in Shanghai on August 9th. The lottery ticket office has issued a public announcement. Since the issuance of these lottery tickets at the end of last month, sales have been very brisk. Both Chinese and foreign people have been actively purchasing tickets, and the number of letters from overseas Chinese to the office requesting to purchase tickets has been overwhelming. Previously, the lottery tickets were drawn every two months, with 500,000 tickets issued each time. Among these, 50,665 tickets were winning tickets. The office felt that the above method involved too much time per draw and that there were too few winning tickets compared to the large number of tickets issued. In order to increase the chances of winning and generate interest among ticket buyers, it was decided that starting from the 13th issue, the draws would be held monthly, with 300,000 tickets issued each time. New prize tiers were also established to increase the number of winning tickets. The proposals were submitted to the Ministry of Finance and then to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. According to the new method, the total amount of funds remains at 50% of the number of tickets issued. The prize distribution is as follows: First Prize, a single prize of 250,000 yuan; two more Second Prizes than before; sixteen more Third Prizes; ninety more Fourth Prizes; two hundred and fifty more Fifth Prizes; five hundred more Sixth Prizes; the original Seventh Prize is eliminated; two First Prize matching number add-on prizes, eight Second Prize matching number add-on prizes, in addition to prizes for matching the last two digits and the last digit of the First Prize. The total number of winning tickets is 31,034. Overall, the number of tickets issued each time is reduced by two-fifths compared to before, while the proportion of winning tickets is increased by more than 630 tickets compared to before, so the chances of winning for ticket buyers are greater than before. Furthermore, changing the issuance period from two months to one month is particularly appealing to the general psychology of ticket buyers, so brisk sales are a natural outcome.</p>

<p>The Advantages of Domestic Soy Sauce Coloring: Soy sauce is a purely domestic product of our country and an essential ingredient in Chinese cuisine. Its widespread use is well known. Soy sauce manufacturers must add coloring to achieve a beautiful appearance. Traditionally, the coloring agent used in our country is made from malt and broken rice, cooked into maltose syrup by hand. However, with the advancement of science, chemical methods can now be used, taking cornstarch as raw material and adding other medicinal ingredients to produce glucose as a substitute. The cost is, of course, lower. However, after precise research, it has been concluded that soy sauce made with maltose syrup is superior. Soy sauce made with the new method of coloring turns red when cooked with meat, while soy sauce made with cornstarch coloring turns black. Furthermore, when maltose syrup and cornstarch coloring are separately mixed with soy sauce and exposed to sunlight, one turns red and the other yellow, one clear and the other cloudy. The difference in quality is easily discernible. Therefore, experienced soy sauce manufacturers now use maltose syrup as a coloring agent to ensure both color and appearance are excellent. However, there are also new and old methods for making maltose syrup coloring. The new method uses machines for cooking, achieving sufficient color intensity and transparency. However, the only commercially available maltose syrup coloring made with machines is the Foshou Brand from Tianchu Factory and the Sanxing Brand and Guohe Brand from the China Chemical Industrial Society. The Guohe Brand is available in red and blue versions. All the above coloring agents are entirely domestic products. Other miscellaneous brands are unreliable.</p>

<h3 id="e187">Japanese Sports Medical Consultation Office Announces: Track and Field Athletes Suffer the Most Illnesses <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Japan Associated Press) In order to promote sports in Japan and improve the physical condition of athletes, the Sports Research Institute was established within the Ministry of Education in Showa 8 (1933), along with the affiliated Sports Medical Consultation Office. According to the office's announcement, in the past two years, a total of 3,223 athletes have sought treatment at the office. In terms of the types of sports, track and field athletes account for the largest number of patients, followed by American football, baseball, and fencing. The most common complaint is chest pain, followed by gastrointestinal disorders and joint pain in the feet. In terms of the types of illnesses, lung diseases are the most common, affecting 213 people, followed by heart disease (41 people) and pleurisy (38 people). The high incidence of tuberculosis among athletes is a significant concern. Furthermore, in sports such as swimming, which involve short periods of exertion, athletes excrete large amounts of red blood cells and protein in their urine. In normal people, this would be a sign of kidney inflammation, requiring absolute rest, but it is irrelevant in athletes. This phenomenon is truly peculiar. The office plans to study the relationship between different sports and diseases in order to resolve these mysteries.</p>

<h3 id="e190">Polish Athletes Selected to Participate in the World Games; Retrials and Various Ball Games Gather at the Central Sports Hall for Training <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>(European Correspondence) European countries have recently promoted sports, and significant progress has been made. Emerging nations such as Poland and Czechoslovakia are particularly noteworthy. Outside Warsaw, the capital of Poland, there is a large Central Sports Hall. The surrounding scenery is extremely beautiful, and the facilities are complete. The hall was established in 1928 at the initiative of the late national hero Marshal Józef Piłsudski, with the aim of developing sports to assist military education. The main purposes of the hall's establishment are: (1) to train the best sports instructors and guides for schools, armies, social organizations, and other institutions; (2) to study advanced sports training methods and conduct experimental work; (3) to train special sports skills such as swordsmanship, boxing, and fitness exercises. The hall is equipped with track and field grounds, swimming pools, various ball courts, male and female game grounds, and combat rooms. The training period for men and women is two years, including four semesters. Students must spend three weeks in winter camp and four weeks in summer camp each year. The winter camp is located in the mountains or foothills, mainly for ice skating, boxing, riding, and archery training. The summer camp is located by a lake at the foot of a mountain, mainly for swimming, rowing, and track and field training. Since its establishment, the hall has cultivated numerous talents.</p>
<p>Attending the World Games</p>
<p>European countries are actively preparing for the next World Games to be held in Berlin. People from all walks of life in Poland are particularly interested. A preparatory committee for attending the World Games has been organized by sports experts. After careful selection, the athletes selected include eight track and field athletes, eight boxers, ten rowers, eight fencers, a polo team, a soccer team, a basketball team, eleven riders, and six ice skaters. All selected athletes have been sent to the Central Sports Hall for rigorous training.</p>
<p>Track and Field Strength</p>
<p>The Polish track and field team participating in the World Games adopts a strategy of elite troops, selecting only the top record holders, eight men and women. In a previous match between the Polish and Italian track and field teams, Italy won with a score of 69 to 54. However, in the Baltic Sea Games, Poland ranked first with 134 points, followed by Estonia with 129 points and Latvia with 72 points. Last year, the Polish women's track and field team was invited to visit Japan, winning a major victory with a score of 62 to 37. The most famous of the selected track and field athletes is Gyso Xin Szki, who defeated the world champion Finnish athlete Mr. Nommi in the 10,000-meter, 20,000-meter, and 30,000-meter long-distance races. There will be a fierce competition at the Games. Miss Huanlan Xizhi, who currently holds the world record for short-distance running, is highly regarded and has recently achieved 11 seconds in the 100 meters and 24 seconds in the 200 meters, and there will be no problem winning the championship. Next is Miss Weiss, who holds the world record for women's discus, looking down on everything, making it difficult to compete with her.</p>
<p>Team Status</p>
<p>Although the strength of the Polish teams cannot be said to be the strongest, their strength is definitely above the average. In terms of soccer strength, according to last year's operations, they tied with Austria 3-3, defeated Germany 1-0, and lost to Sweden 2-3. The polo and basketball teams are also very strong. In tennis, they defeated Bulgaria 4-1, Estonia 5-0, Greece and Denmark in last year's Tai Cup, and lost to France 2-3. Hibert, the national tennis champion, defeated the famous French tennis player Boro Gera.</p>
<p>Ice Skating and Fencing</p>
<p>Europe attaches great importance to fencing. At the European Fencing Competition held in Warsaw last year, Poland won sixth and eighth place individually and third place in the team competition. In ice skating, Poland defeated Czechoslovakia 30-18 last year. Famous athletes Mr. Guo Weixi and Miss Bira won third place in the European Championships. Miss Nairin won a world record of 10 seconds and 59.8 seconds in the Qi Luomi distance race. In women's archery, Poland won the world championship last year, and Mrs. Koukes won the world individual championship. In light-heavyweight boxing, Poland lost to Germany and Hungary last year but defeated Austria and Czechoslovakia, so there will definitely be a fierce battle in next year's Games.</p>

<p>Zhen Ri</p>
<p>On the 9th, the Ministry of Education issued an instruction to the private Zhen Ri University, stating, "The Ministry previously sent personnel to inspect the school and submitted a report that was reviewed and approved. The school's financial allocation is sufficient, it emphasizes equipment, faculty and staff are dedicated to their full-time duties and are diligent in their work. The training of students is quite strict and commendable. However, the following points still need to be earnestly improved: 1. The school's medical college has both a general medicine department and a dentistry department, which is inconsistent with the university regulations that medical colleges should not have separate departments. The name of the general medicine department should be cancelled, and the dentistry department should be changed to a specialized course. 2. Important positions in the school should be filled by Chinese scholars, and the disparity in treatment between Chinese and foreign teachers should be improved. 3. The school admits many unregistered middle school graduates as new students, and in the future, it should strictly review their qualifications and carefully select and admit them. In addition, the Chinese language proficiency of the students is generally weak and special attention should be paid during the entrance examination. You are hereby ordered to comply and report accordingly."</p>
<p>Da Xia</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Education issued another order to the private Da Xia University, stating, "The Ministry previously issued key points for improvement to the school. However, the inspectors reported that the school has not complied with the previous order. Therefore, the following key points are specifically highlighted and must be earnestly improved and reported for review: 1. The management of the school's business school is not satisfactory. However, the graduates of the business school have good career prospects, so it is provisionally allowed to continue on a trial basis. The enrollment quota should be reduced next year, and the content should be greatly enriched. 2. The school's finances have a large annual deficit. The board of directors should raise additional funds to increase income and reduce office and temporary expenses to reduce expenditures, in order to achieve a balance between income and expenditure. 3. The salaries of the school's teachers are very low. The number of part-time teachers should be reduced as much as possible, and the salaries of full-time teachers should be increased. 4. The chemical department's instruments and reagents need to be supplemented, and the advanced equipment for the soil science department above the third grade is not configured. The physical equipment of the mathematics and physics department is very lacking and should be added and supplemented separately for application. The curriculum of the mathematics and physics department is also too complex and should be re-compiled. 5. The school's enrollment is still too lenient. In the future, the standards should be raised and admission should be stricter. The aspect of regular training and management should also be rectified. This order."</p>
<p>Shanghai Law College</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education also issued an order to the private Shanghai Law College the day before yesterday, stating, "The Ministry previously issued key points for improvement to the college. The inspectors reported that the college has paid attention to implementing the previous order for improvement. However, there are still many shortcomings. The following points are specifically highlighted for your attention. You must earnestly improve and report accordingly: 1. Increase the number of full-time teachers who can take responsibility, improve their treatment, and reduce the number of part-time teachers. 2. More Western books should be added to the library for research and reference. The library management methods should be improved properly. 3. Pay attention to students' regular training and improve teaching methods to foster a culture of academic research and improve students' level. The entrance examination must be conducted strictly. 4. The board of directors should quickly clear the old debts to avoid affecting the progress of the college. This order."</p>

<h3 id="e199">The 14th Joint Graduation Ceremony of Municipal Private Schools was Held Yesterday; a Total of More Than 2,000 Graduates from 59 Schools; Government Subsidy Averaging 3 Yuan and 8 Jiao Per Person <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>The 14th joint graduation ceremony of municipal private schools in this city was held yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM in the auditorium of the Municipal Public Education Preparatory School on Wenmiao Road. Graduation certificates and badges were distributed on the spot. Participants included party representatives Huang Zaoxiong, Section Chief Jiang and Li Wanyu of the Municipal Bureau of Education, principals of private schools, and this year's graduates, totaling more than 2,000 people. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Chairman Jiang, Bai, Ke, and Tang, after performing the rituals, first reported the following: "Today is the joint graduation ceremony of the 14th Municipal Public School in this city. This year, there are a total of 59 schools, 74 classes. 3,540 students enrolled, some of whom dropped out midway. There are more than 2,400 graduates, accounting for 67%. This year's expenses totaled 9,100 yuan. Calculating based on the graduating students, the government provides an average of 3 yuan and 8 jiao per person. The Bureau of Education is specifically responsible for the meaning of running public schools, because it recognizes the pain of illiteracy. You are all citizens of the Republic of China, and because of illiteracy, you cannot understand the situation of the country and society. Therefore, running public schools is one way to enable everyone to read and understand the way to be a person. At the same time, everyone can serve the country and society. The municipal government recognizes the importance of literacy, so in addition to running public schools, it has recently run literacy schools, so that illiterate people can recognize more than 600 characters after one month. You are studying in public schools, recognizing 1,000 characters in four months, which is more fortunate than the students in literacy schools. I hope everyone pays attention to the fact that the purpose of going to school is to learn how to be a person and do things. After graduation, you must step up your learning and should be responsible for passing on what you have learned to illiterate people. This way, you will not fail the teachers' teachings, the government's cultivation, and the expectations of society."</p>
<p>Representative's Speech</p>
<p>Next, Huang Zaoxiong, the representative of the Municipal Party Department, delivered a speech, saying, "Graduation does not mean that you should not study. It is just the end of a stage. Learning is endless. After graduation, you must continue to strive for progress and pass on what you have learned to others. More than 80% of the Chinese population is illiterate, especially women. Four months ago, you were all illiterate. Now, without spending any money, you have become literate, which is much more fortunate than the general illiterate population. I hope everyone works hard and makes progress." Then, student representatives Qiu Songmei from the First Experimental Public School and Yang Yuexian from the Third Experimental Public School delivered thank-you speeches, and then a group photo was taken and the ceremony dispersed.</p>

<p>Management has gradually attracted the attention of the Chinese people, but only in recent years. During this period, since the establishment of the China Industrial and Commercial Management Association, it has actively promoted management and spared no effort. The "Industrial Management Training Class" jointly organized by the association and the China Federation of Mechanical Engineering Associations last year was specifically designed to cultivate scientific management talents. Nearly 100 students have graduated from the two sessions. Now, everyone is seeking to conduct further research together and promote the development of scientific management in China. Therefore, an alumni association was organized at the China Industrial and Commercial Management Association yesterday afternoon. Zheng Eryi and others were elected as directors on the spot, and Li Nai and others were elected as supervisors. Cao Yunxiang, Tu Zheyin, and Tang Ze made earnest speeches to the students.</p>

It was decided to add vocational application subjects starting next semester, so that each student can choose to learn what they need to prepare for employment. It is also heard that the school has organized an enrollment committee and will start registration from today.</p>
<p>Shanghai School for the Deaf and Mute</p>
<p>The calligraphy and painting exhibition of the Shanghai School for the Deaf and Mute on Xilin Heng Road, Laoximen, was held at the YMCA on the 2nd and 3rd of this month. It is reported that the results were very good. All the remaining calligraphy and painting tickets were sealed and stored separately by the organizer, Mr. Zhang Shouyong. The most valuable masterpiece at this exhibition was Mr. Wang Yiting's painting of He Jing releasing a crane, which was drawn by a gentleman from the Bank of Communications. A painting of ink bamboo was drawn by Soong Tzu-wen. A painting of pine trees was drawn by the Cloth Exchange. Mr. Zhang Yongni, a director of the school, donated the first collection of the Siming Series, which was drawn by the Gold Exchange. Xie Gongzhan donated ten pieces, eight of which were drawn. The remaining two paintings of sea cranes and cranes of longevity by Wang Yiting, as well as couplets, Huang Binhong's landscape Siming Series, and the works of other famous artists, were all sealed and stored by the organizer Zhang. How to handle them will be decided after the organizer Zhang and others discuss it. In addition, the school has recently reduced tuition, board, lodging, and miscellaneous fees and expanded the number of free places in order to reduce the burden on parents of deaf and mute students. Day after day, mute students have been coming to register for admission in an endless stream. It is reported that the school is scheduled to open on August 25th.</p>

<p>Things that can be done don't need to be said; things that can't be done even less need to be said. Things that have been done don't need to be said; things that have never been done even less need to be said.

<h3 id="e204">A Song <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Shaofei</p>
<p>When I was a child, I liked to follow my companions, cutting goat grass, catching squirrels to raise them. Whenever I saw a nest in a tree, I would desperately try to be the first to climb the tree. My clothes would be torn by the branches, and I would even be so busy that I would return home with an empty grass basket. Being beaten by my mother and going hungry was a common occurrence.</p>
<p>Now, I am almost thirty years old, and I am still this childish. When people I know well go back to their hometowns, I sincerely ask them to buy me one, but they always say they forgot or couldn't buy one. I guess it's too much trouble for them to bring such a thing.</p>
<p>Last spring, when my third younger brother came to Shanghai to study business, the first thing he said when he entered the door was, "Second brother, I brought you a squirrel in my bag." He put down his luggage and took the squirrel out of the bag and handed it to me. I was overjoyed and happily placed it in a paper box with a square hole. At night, I held it and put it next to my pillow.</p>
<p>Whenever I had free time, I fed it milk and cake. Because my family constantly said things that I didn't want to hear, "Raising a squirrel is more reliable than having food to eat; it's more filial than serving your parents," they also hoped that A Song would be eaten by the little tabby cat as a mouse. A Song seemed to have a deep hatred for them, but the little tabby cat had already become its companion. When the little tabby cat jumped to the east, it also jumped to the east; when it jumped to the west, the little tabby cat also followed it to the west.</p>
<p>When the sky was slightly bright, it would climb out of the window to play, the silver bell around its neck ringing. When I had free time, I would call it over to play. When I called out "A Song, come here!" it would fly from afar, jump onto my body, and snuggle in my arms, as if it couldn't bear to leave me to go out and play.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Cool Tea House <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Master of Spring Rain Pavilion</p>
<p>The heat of the sun is gradually increasing the degree marked on the thermometer. General modern women have already put on thin cicada-winged short-sleeved gauze shirts, and the lower body is still naked, wearing hollow high-heeled leather shoes with bare feet. Although the "Carnation" white powder is rubbed from the thighs to the toes, it can't hide the faintly visible frostbite black scars on the heels. If we don't concentrate our gaze and stare intently, how can the slight scars be so obvious? If she discovers that you are staring foolishly, you may hear her scold you for being a mischievous ghost. How great is the attraction of fleshy legs! No wonder so many young people are attracted to the cool tea houses to drink tea. Speaking of the location of the cool tea houses, it is indeed very good. Although it is so far from the hustle and bustle of the city, people are also willing to come, because there are quiet mountains, clear green springs, and crisscrossing rice fields, a very poetic natural landscape painting. If you don't appreciate it for a while, wouldn't you be letting down the mountain spirits? What's more, there are intoxicating powder legs?</p>
<p>Cool tea houses are a seasonal specialty in our town, but they are as short-lived as autumn fans. As long as the autumn wind rises, they are abandoned! However, in the scorching summer, they can be said to be quite prominent. Because it is too far from the town, smart bosses use women to attract tea drinkers. There is not a day that the tea drinkers are not crowded. From morning to night, there is always no empty seat. However, the original intention of coolness has long been lost. If you go to drink a bowl of tea, the heat from the crowd will make you unable to bear it. But these tea drinkers are like "ants clinging to fat" every day. The boss smiles like a Maitreya Buddha, welcoming every customer. This can be regarded as a great way for him to earn a large income in the summer.</p>

<p>Thinking to this point, he felt that the world was not only ugly, but also cruel. He couldn't help but reach out and slam his hand on the table. Coincidentally, the kerosene lamp on the table was already quite old, and the wick turner was very loose. In the midst of this table shaking, the wick suddenly fell downward, almost extinguishing. Only then did Zhiqian realize that he had already taken action for this matter. This was truly strange. What did Zhu Yueying's affairs have to do with him? Why was he so angry? Could it be that he really wanted to give away one hundred and fifty yuan to prevent this girl from being sold? If that were the case, not only would Jia Duocai and he become bitter enemies, but Wang Beihai would also have even more misunderstandings. Moreover, this one hundred and fifty yuan could only maintain Zhu Yueying's current state. In her harsh environment, she would probably be sold sooner or later. What was the use of giving away one hundred and fifty yuan for nothing? He muttered to himself, "Let's go to sleep," and then went to bed and lay down. It was very strange; the quilt he covered every night, when he spread it out at this time, seemed to have a faint fragrance of rouge powder wafting into his nose. Because of this fragrance, he would inevitably think of Zhu Yueying again. Therefore, even though his eyes were closed after his head rested on the pillow, his heart was extremely flustered, and he was thinking about everything. He seemed to hear the grandfather clock in the front parlor strike twice. He thought to himself that a girl like Yueying, although she seemed very gentle and easily bullied, her subconscious was very resistant. Perhaps she was still making a final struggle against a demon like Jia Duocai, trying to break free. In that case, she needed someone to help her at this moment. (261)</p>

<p>Because the mesh of the filter was not very fine, there were still some medicinal dregs left in the medicinal juice after the first filtering. Of course, it could not be sent to the Empress Dowager to drink. So they filtered it again and again until there were no dregs at all before daring to pour it into the Empress Dowager's jade bowl. But there was a lot of medicinal juice! And it was specially cooked more of. They filled the four porcelain cups as well. I couldn't help but wonder who else wanted to drink the medicinal concoction?</p>
<p>At this moment, everything was ready, and someone went to inform the Empress Dowager. After a while, this person came out with the Empress Dowager's decree, ordering the four imperial physicians to enter her private hall together again. So the Empress Dowager's jade bowl led the way, I followed second, then the four imperial physicians, and a eunuch holding the four porcelain cups brought up the rear. When they arrived in front of the Empress Dowager, the four gentlemen had to kowtow first before kneeling down. I saw the jade bowl handed to the Empress Dowager's hand, and when I quickly turned my head to look, I saw that the four small porcelain cups were held separately in the hands of the four imperial physicians. They were obviously holding them awkwardly, but everyone was trying their best to endure it. Then, as neatly as if they were doing military drills, they brought the porcelain cups to their lips, tilted their heads back, and drank them all in one gulp. At that time, I really felt twelve points of surprise and almost laughed out loud. I barely managed to restrain myself. And I thought that the medicinal juice must be very bitter, yet they were able to swallow it in one breath like that, truly only possible with proper training. Moreover, I looked closely at their faces, and there was practically no expression at all. This courage was really admirable! (361)</p>
<h3 id="e209">Continued Notes on Modern Objects with Ancient Names <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Min</p>
<p>Previously, I collected some modern objects with ancient names from that book and published them in this journal. The intention was to provide some conversation material. Now, there are several more items, so I am recording them here as well.</p>
<p>Among the things we use daily, lamps are called "jade lotus" in ancient times, and mats are called "　苗," which is suitable for music, so it is also called "　曲." Women's skirts are called "wraparound quilts" in ancient times, and half-sleeved jackets are called "embroidered digs." Also, candlesticks are called "lotus torches" in ancient times, presumably because the utensils were shaped like lotus flowers made of metal. Therefore, "lotus torches" were not originally the name of candles.</p>
<p>Modern women often dye their fingernails with shellac, making them deep red or light crimson in color. They are beautiful and pleasing to the eye, and more charming than using the juice of balsam flowers to dye them, as in the old days. According to the annotations of Li Yishan's poems, there was an ancient name of "jia jian." Chen Fan cited the fragrance recipes of the Han Palace, saying that it was made from a kind of fragrant wood powder that was yellow like honeycombs, mixed with fragrance to collect the scent, and tested with the fingers when frying, until the grease solidified on the nails... According to Chen Zangqi, "jia jian" was made by burning the ashes of herbs and beautiful fruits and flowers, mixed with 　and treated. It could be used as lip rouge, presumably like shellac.</p>
<p>There are many modern foods that have different names in ancient times, which can be found in ancient books. For example, "jiaoshu" (粽子) was called "wrapped dumpling" during the Song Dynasty in the Southern Dynasties. "Shaobing" (燒餅) was called "hubing" (胡餅) during the Tang Dynasty of Emperor Xuanzong. "Yuanxiao" (元宵), or tangyuan (湯糰), was called "tangzao" (糖糙) in ancient times. 　Zi (餜子) was called "hanju" (寒具) in ancient times. "Mantou" (饅頭) was called "longbing" (籠餅) in ancient times. Also, foods made by freezing various kinds of dried meat, such as chicken, duck, and fish, also had a name in ancient times: "zhu la" (瘃臘).</p>
<p>Among children's toys, there is the so-called "spinning top," which is called "digezi" (地鴿子) in the local dialect of my hometown. In ancient times, there was also this device, called "kongzhong" (空鐘). According to its shape, it is the same as "digezi."</p>
<p>Recently, the place for measuring the climate is called an observatory, and there are instruments for it. However, the previous generations also had this method. According to the Book of the Later Han, Dai You had a method of observing the weather, using bamboo tubes and reed ash, with a triple-layered room and silk curtains inside as a table. The laws were placed on top, and when the air arrived, the ash flew up, etc. This place for observing the weather was called "tishi" (緹室), meaning perhaps the observatory?</p>
<p>Notes on Local Customs</p>
<h3 id="e210">Sketches of Customs in Various Parts of Japan <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Along</p>
<p>Aotani Village belongs to the Ketaka District of Tottori Prefecture, Japan, and has a considerable historical status. In ancient times, remnants of commoners, after failing in the Battle of Dan-no-ura, served the Emperor and sacred objects and fled to that place. Therefore, in the Azube-no Village area of Iwami District, near Aotani Village, there is the mausoleum of Emperor Antoku. During the Keicho era, when Toyotomi Hideyoshi invaded Korea, a young man named Isobe Juro repeatedly performed outstanding feats on the battlefield and was rewarded by the Emperor. As a result, the name of Aotani Village became familiar to the Japanese people.</p>
<p>The village has a population of about four thousand people. Common surnames include "Isobe," "Iwahana," "Kaizetsu," "Koiwa," "Hebiana," "Iwamichi," "Takebayashi," and "Okishima." Common given names include "Shinmatsu," "Suekomatsu," "Kiyomasa," "Iwamatsu," "　　," "　　," "　　," and "　　." Therefore, people outside the village can tell if a person is from Aotani Village just by asking their name.</p>
<p>The village area is dominated by large familyism. Ordinary families have from six or seven to twenty members. According to their custom, the eldest son gets married first, followed by the second and third sons in order. After marriage, each couple lives in the same room. Even when they reach the age of forty or fifty, with children and brothers still living together, it is not considered strange. If the head of the family dies, the eldest son assumes the role of head of the household, which is called "koshu" (戶主) in Japanese. At the same time, the second and third sons take their wives and children and carry out family division. The so-called family division is actually limited by economics. Because they cannot build houses, the eldest son often gives them some property to go to Hokkaido, Sakhalin, or other places to do business, or to immigrate to South America or the three northeastern provinces of China. The number of these immigrants each year is not small. They have become a kind of faction, called the Aotani Village lineage.</p>
<p>The heads of households from various families in Aotani Village organize a kind of gathering, which is held once a month at the Isobe family's house. Every two months, they elect a "Shimatou" (島頭), who is the highest authority in the village. Each head of household has the right to vote and be elected. After being elected, the Shimatou is responsible for managing the affairs of the entire village. The Shimatou employs six staff members to assist in all village affairs.</p>
<p>The Isobe family's property is very large, so the village market is also attached to it, and it also serves as a warehouse. The most communistic aspect of this village's life is in the distribution of production. Ordinary men weave nets and collect firewood, and women grow vegetables and sew clothes. At a certain time, everyone brings their own things and gathers at the Isobe family's house. The Shimatou and staff members determine the market price according to the relationship between supply and demand. The supply and demand sides each take home what they need and are entitled to. The remaining things become public property. The Shimatou observes the labor status of the day and gives labor rewards accordingly. This distribution method is completely communist in nature, almost like in the primitive era thousands of years ago.</p>
<p>According to the village's regulations, all men and women over the age of fifteen receive one share in the distribution. Those under fifteen receive only half a share, and infants in swaddling clothes receive only one-third of a share. All those who do direct labor enjoy the right to share dividends. People who are chronically ill or disabled also receive half a share. As for soldiers and students, they enjoy a full share in the same way. They live this special life, so they can be said to have virtually no knowledge of the law. I plan to go and investigate once, find out the general sentiment, and then inform the readers.</p>

<p>Disappointment with US Banking Policy, Silver Market Expected to Rise but Instead Falls. The Hong Kong Market's Continuous Tightening Drives Local Buying Interest. The Gold Market's Open Market Also Rose to $854.</p>
<p>The exchange rate market yesterday saw a sharp tightening of about two pennies in the Hong Kong exchange rate, which drove local buying interest and led to fluctuating prices. According to foreign telegrams, a large deal in London suddenly decreased by 25 in the near term. Sources said that after the market closed, the United States was only buying at or below 0.0625 or 0.125. The New York silver price decreased by half a cent. The forward silver price in Montedry fell by 5.5 to 7 cents. The price of raw gold in London fell by three pennies. The British pound strengthened against the US dollar by one and a half points. The British pound strengthened against the French franc by sixteen pounds. The US dollar strengthened against the British pound by one point. The US dollar strengthened against the French franc by half a point. The exchange rate market opened in the morning with a near-term selling price of one shilling and seven pennies for the British pound and thirty-nine yuan and thirty-one two-fifths for the US dollar, which was tighter than the previous closing price by about 0.0625. However, this price was short-lived and difficult to maintain. After opening, Chinese brokers stepped in to buy, and the Bombay positions also tightened. The HSBC bank's listed prices were down by 0.125 for the British pound and 0.25 for the US dollar, and the process tightened further. The full-warehouse exchange rate had tightened by 0.125. Sources said that there were many buyers and no sellers. Wasson &amp; Co. and others were also buying, and the trend was upward. Reuters reported that the London Financial Times's observation that the United States would no longer force the purchase of silver had little impact. Before long, Reuters reported that the price of silver in India was expected to rise by four annas in July. Although the price in the black market for gold had risen to over 50 yuan, sellers then surged, and suddenly the price fell back. The Hong Kong exchange rate hardened further by 0.125. After the noon closing, Reuters telegrammed that the Hong Kong market had suddenly tightened by 0.4375, and the British exchange rate had tightened to 2.075, which was because of the influence of the London Financial Times's report that there would be a selling trend in the silver market. As a result, the market repeated the tightening trend. After opening, the Hong Kong market tightened again and again, for a total of half a penny. Therefore, although Joe Zhifu tried to block it, he was helpless as the reported price of silver in India plummeted by sixteen annas. Sources said that there was a closing of positions on the part of many and a lack of buyers, and that the US's silver purchase policy was seen as disappointing. Demand exceeded supply, and the price of the US dollar rose sharply. The price in the black market for gold also rose. HSBC's listed prices were revised down by 0.125 and 0.25. Banks took the opportunity to sell at a high price, so although the Hong Kong exchange rate tightened by 0.125, the situation stabilized somewhat. Finally, the price of silver in India rose back by eight annas. Although the Hong Kong exchange rate was still tight by 0.125, the process rapidly loosened. The closing price for the near term was one shilling and six pennies and eight seventy-fifths and seventy-five paired for the British exchange rate, and thirty-eight yuan and sixty-eight seventy-fifths for the US dollar, which was tighter than the previous closing price by 0.375 for the British pound and 0.6875 for the US dollar. Chinese merchants bought 50,000 pounds in British currency and $300,000 in US currency. The price in the black market for gold rose from 44 yuan to 54 yuan, and finally settled at around 49.5 yuan. The day's trading record is as follows:</p>

Various market prices have therefore not changed temporarily.

<p>Yesterday, after consecutive days of sharp declines on the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, market prices had fallen significantly. As a result, short sellers who had profited came out to cover their positions, and new longs became active again. Demand on the floor suddenly became strong, and a rebound began. All bonds rose uniformly, and market prices gradually advanced. As a result, there was a significant rebound of three to five cents or even more than one yuan compared to the previous day. However, the closing situation suddenly turned hesitant, indicating that the pressure on the floor was still very strong. The future trend could not be optimistic. Yesterday's process: at the morning opening, prices initially remained stagnant, and new low prices were found for various bonds. The situation began to change from the ninth, and the fourteenth and twentieth bonds began to cover their positions, and the fifty-third bonds also engaged in absorption. Demand suddenly became strong, and a rebound began. All bonds rose sharply by about half a yuan uniformly. The gold short-term bonds suddenly became weak due to the selling of the fourth bond, but finally, due to the activity of the new longs, the twenty-third level rebounded again. In the second session, the thirty-fifth and fifty-ninth bonds continued to absorb, and various bonds continued to rise. Gold short-term bonds rose sharply by as much as one yuan due to special demand. Before the close, the fourteenth, thirty-fifth and southern bonds were still in strong demand, continuing to rise by about half a yuan. The situation in the rear gradually weakened, and the price of the sixth bond suddenly fell by more than two cents due to long positions closing out. In total, the total transaction volume for the day was 23,225,000 yuan. The comparison table of the high and low results is listed on the left. (Unit: Yuan, Transaction Unit: Hundred Yuan)</p>

<p>Xinhua Yangxing reported that yesterday (August 8), the New York stock market saw a lively market and rising prices due to good industrial reports, such as steel production increasing to 35.3%, an increase of 7.6% compared to last week. In addition, Finance Minister Morganthau stated to the Congressional Budget Committee that the most serious crisis in the United States had now passed. Small exchange stocks rose slightly and unevenly, and the bond market fell slightly and unevenly. The total daily trading volume was 1.31 million shares.

<h3 id="e214">Yarn Flower: Japanese Yarn Merchants Seize Opportunities During Low Prices <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and was sluggish in the afternoon, but the situation remained relatively stable. Due to heavy pressure from sellers, most were bearish. According to market sources, only the Japanese-owned and Chinese-owned factories, such as Nihua and Donghua, bought heavily during price dips. Therefore, the market rebounded after the fall. However, the overall environment remained unfavorable and credit remained tight. Furthermore, the base had become weak, with an increasing number of Chinese factories in Shanghai reducing production or shutting down. Production volume had decreased by nearly 50% compared to before, which may alleviate the downward trend in the future.</p>
<p>Recent Yarn Prices Broke the 60 Yuan Mark</p>
<p>In the morning trading of standard yarn, prices for all months fell sharply, with a particularly strong downward trend. It was rumored that Hengfeng Factory had delivered Fugui yarn, but this was questioned by reporters. While the factory had inventory, the spot market price was three to four yuan higher than the exchange's standard yarn price. The factory had already completely stopped production and had no output. However, speculators were desperately trying to sell, leading to active selling. This month, prices broke through the 60 yuan mark, reaching 159.5 yuan (equivalent to only 114 taels of standard silver). However, some sources said that Japanese merchants had been buying during recent price dips. As a result, prices for all months fell by 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.8 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon, due to foreign merchants covering their positions and Tongcheng also entering the market, prices gradually rebounded, and the market became slightly tighter. As a result, prices for all months rebounded by 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. Sales included 1,850 bales from Yi Da, 1,100 bales from Tai Yu, 750 bales from Sen Tai, 800 bales from Renfeng, 550 bales from Yuan Yi, 2,050 bales from Hengchang, 650 bales from Da Chang, and 1,000 bales from Shen Ji. Purchases included 2,600 bales from Da Fu, 500 bales from Tong Ji, 700 bales from Yuan Da, 1,250 bales from He Xing, 2,350 bales from Shen Ji, 550 bales from Tai Chang, 1,450 bales from Yi Chang, 1,500 bales from Changfeng, and 550 bales from Da Chang. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Standard Yarn	Highest Price	Lowest Price	Closing Price	Change	Inventory</p>
<p>July	160.5	159.5	160.5	-0.50	25,150</p>
<p>August	162.6	161.5	162.6	0.10	44,500</p>
<p>September	163.9	163.0	163.9	0.10	43,700</p>

<p>December	166.4	165.5	166.4	…	8,650</p>
<p>Total	189,000</p>
<p>Continued Yarn Sales</p>
<p>Current yarn sales are still good. Total sales for the day by various groups are estimated at 658 bales. Market sentiment is weak. Japanese yarn sales reached 200 bales, with steady prices for 16-count and 20-count yarns. Fine yarn thread prices are falling. The purchase amounts by various groups are listed below:</p>
<p>Guangdong	315</p>
<p>Inland	140</p>
<p>Haizhou	95</p>
<p>Wuhu	10</p>
<p>Xuzhou	10</p>

<p>The cotton market rebounded after falling, and the situation is quite bullish. This is because the US cotton acreage report did not show a significant increase, reporting 29,166,000 acres, an increase of 1,142,000 acres compared to last year's 28,024,000 acres. However, market prices fell slightly by 1 to 5 points. Recently, the calculated price of imported cotton is two yuan higher than before. Therefore, foreign merchants are buying in the cotton futures market, making the market trend more bullish than the yarn market.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Buy Zheng Biao Cotton</p>
<p>In the morning trading of standard cotton, prices for all months fell sharply with a strong downward trend. Due to the acreage report showing an increase compared to last year, sentiment was uniformly bearish, and sellers rushed to the market. The November contract broke through the one yuan mark. Unexpectedly, Japanese merchants took advantage of the price drop to buy again, with substantial volume. Prices gradually rebounded around 3 PM. As a result, recent prices were similar to the previous day's closing price, with the far months rising by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. In the afternoon, sellers continued to exert pressure until around 3 PM, when market sentiment suddenly tightened. Japanese merchants' buying was particularly strong. The reason was that exchange rates were extremely tight, with the unofficial premium on the exchange reaching 850 yuan, more than 10 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. Therefore, the market turned bullish. As a result, prices for all months rose by 0.05 to 0.1-0.2 yuan compared to the morning closing price. Sales included 9,600 dan from Tong Ji, 1,200 dan from Da Fu, 2,600 dan from Da Feng, 2,100 dan from Yuan Da, 3,400 dan from He Xing, 1,500 dan from Chang Yu, 2,700 dan from Tai Chang, 2,200 dan from Yi Chang, and 1,600 dan from Sheng Yuan. Purchases included 1,500 dan from Da Feng, 6,500 dan from Da Fu, 4,300 dan from Gengfeng, 2,600 dan from Shen Ji, 7,000 dan from Chang He, 4,900 dan from Run Tai, 2,100 dan from Xin Cheng, 2,500 dan from Sheng Yuan, and 1,800 dan from Yuan Xingchang. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>July	32.10	31.70	32.10	——	103,100</p>
<p>August	31.70	31.40	31.70	Up 0.05	163,700</p>

<h3 id="e218">US Cotton Weather Report Favorable <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened lower due to unfavorable news from Liverpool. The weekend weather report was favorable, and brokers closed long positions. Mills, domestic merchants, and Liverpool were selling. Prices for all months fell by 4 to 11 points. Demand was limited. Prior to the report's release, there was limited limit-price trading. Afterwards, brokers bought again, and prices rebounded slightly. Local merchants sold, and spot merchants also sold in anticipation of the new crop. Near the close, the market was supported by strength in grains and stocks, and local merchants bought, resulting in a firm close. The spot price fell by 5 points, and futures prices fell by 1 to 3 points. English cotton spot prices were unchanged, and futures prices fell by 1-2 points. Prior to the US cotton government report, Indian cotton saw longs closing positions and European exports selling. Broach fell by 0.75 to 1.75 rupees, Oomra fell by 0.75 to 1.75 rupees, and White Western fell by 1 to 1.25 rupees. Original telegrams are recorded on the left (dated the 8th):</p>

<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed signs of stabilization. Chicago wheat rebounded by 0.04-0.05 yuan, and Canadian wheat rose by 0.008 yuan. The market believed that the improvement in imported wheat and the severity of the Yangtze River floods indicated that, without the pressure of imported wheat, prices would likely rise significantly. Milling factories were hesitant to lower prices due to the uncertainty surrounding imported wheat. Therefore, trading volume was not high, and the market remained stable. In the afternoon, trading was even quieter, with only over 90,000 bales traded. Both local and out-of-town customers considered buying, but were wary of the impact of imported wheat and chose to wait and see. As a result, July and August contracts were up 0.0075 yuan, September up 0.005 yuan, October up 0.0075 yuan, November up 0.001 yuan, and December up 0.0125 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Shanghai Wheat Inventory at 100,000 Bales <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Current Truck Wheat Falls by 0.1 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, futures wheat was stable, but the spot month opened lower due to the existing inventory in the market, which had reached approximately 100,000 bales. New arrivals were expected, and after merchants in various inland producing areas ordered imported wheat from Shanghai, market sentiment softened significantly. Therefore, the spot month was pressured by the reality of the situation and had to ease, trading 0.02-0.03 yuan lower than the previous day. Far-month contracts were stable due to the impact of the floods and customers' lack of hedging. In the afternoon, the spot month did not open, while far-month contracts remained stable. Under the current circumstances, if imported wheat does not flood the market, the market can temporarily stabilize. As a result, the spot month was up 0.03 yuan, and September/October were up 0.04 yuan compared to the previous day. In the spot wheat market, truck wheat was being traded, with both sides making concessions. Prices fell by 0.1 yuan compared to the previous week, with Kai Yao Bay Yanghe wheat at 3.37 yuan, Gaoyou wheat at 3.35 yuan, Yangzhou wheat at 3.33 yuan (second grade at 3.28 yuan), Liuhe wheat at 3.32 yuan, and Tangshi wheat at 3.36 yuan. Fuxin bought 1,500 bales, Xinda bought 6,000 bales, and Shenda bought 2,000 bales.</p>

<p>Selling Price Gradually Increases by 0.05 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the imported rice market continued to be firm. Due to the flooding of the Yangtze River, demand from the Jiangxi and Hubei provinces remained strong. Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces also continued to purchase. In addition, local demand within Shanghai was also present. Therefore, speculators' sentiment grew stronger. As Shanghai's inventory gradually decreased, sellers became more reluctant to sell. Prices for all grades rose uniformly by 0.05 yuan. A total of 10,000 bales of Saigon rice, 3,000 bales of small-milled rice, and over 1,000 bales of Suzhou and Jing rice were sold. The market outlook remains stable.</p>
<p>Clear Weather Causes Rice Market to Fall</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, over 30 merchants arrived with goods (totaling over 6,000 piculs). As the weather cleared, sentiment softened. Sales in the local market were unusually quiet. Traders were quoting prices, but only 600-700 bales of cheap Japonica and Indica rice were sold by the Qingdao and Yantai merchants. Consequently, prices for all grades of glutinous rice immediately fell by 0.1-0.2 yuan. Prices for non-glutinous rice also fell by approximately 0.1 yuan. The market for Yuan rice also showed signs of weakness.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the number of merchants arriving at the river docks remained low, approximately 16-17. Sales of high-grade white glutinous rice were not very encouraging. Medium and lower grades were traded with price reductions. Early-season non-glutinous rice was sluggish. The market for Yuan rice remained stagnant in the morning, but activity picked up slightly in the afternoon. Transactions with demanding customers were scarce. Market prices for high-grade white glutinous rice fell by several cents to nearly 0.1 yuan. Medium and lower grades fell by over 0.1 yuan. Prices for non-glutinous rice fell by a little over 0.1 yuan. Prices for early-season rice also fell by a little over 0.1 yuan. Yuan rice continued to fall by 0.1-0.2 yuan. The afternoon market stabilized, with demanding customers showing a neutral to weak attitude.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Sugar Market: Raw and White Sugar Only Rise by 0.02 Yuan <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market showed a slight tightening trend due to rumors that the unofficial premium on Customs Gold Units had reached 1.755. However, in the end, it seemed that there was no strength to rise. At the public auction, 24 lots of white sand sugar were initially bid at 16.05 yuan, but there were no takers. Later, 50 bales were traded at 15.97 yuan, only up 0.02 yuan. Transit goods at 4.8 yuan were also not auctioned. Taikoo Sugar B and M were bid up by 0.05 yuan, to 17.55 yuan. Local-made fine white sugar was unchanged. At the market, only the Jian Gang group offered a few hundred bales of Quanzhou red sugar. Prices varied depending on the quality of the goods, with higher grades at 10-9.8 yuan, ordinary grades at 9.6 yuan, and lower grades at reduced prices. Due to exchange rates, Dongbai sugar rose slightly, with M grade at 16.2 yuan, N grade at 16 yuan, and YPO grade at 15.7 yuan. Dongchi sugar was at 11.9 yuan, unchanged.</p>

<p>The first batch of new Daxing golden needle mushrooms, totaling 70 bales, arrived yesterday. The quality was good, and they were immediately purchased by Guangdong merchants in their entirety. New Xuzhou vegetables continued to arrive, and because of their bright color and drier condition, Guangdong merchants were also very welcoming. A total of over 330 bales were purchased yesterday and immediately loaded onto ships for distribution and sale. Market prices were stable and lacked any upward or downward movement. It is reported that a second batch of over 70 bales of new Daxing vegetables will arrive in Shanghai today.</p>
<p>Zhangzhou Branch Prices Upside Down</p>
<p>The harvest of Lan bamboo branches turned poor this season. Since the arrival of the new crop, only three batches totaling a few hundred boxes have arrived. Although the quantity is small, sales have been slow, and quoted prices are very weak. If calculated based on cost, the prices are nearly 10 yuan below, which is a situation rarely seen in recent years.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the foreign firms' tea market, the transaction of Tunxi's high-grade extracted bud precious eyebrow green tea was still booming. British firms such as Tongfu, Xiehe, Jinlong, and Baochang were all buying. In addition, due to the floods, no goods from Wuyuan had arrived, making the market even more bullish. Prices for upper and middle-grade goods were raised by 2-3 yuan. The other needle eyebrow, pearl tea, and Gongxi varieties also had scattered sales. The sales of Qimen black tea had been stagnant for a long time. Yesterday, Xiehe Foreign Firm bought over a thousand boxes, and selling prices fell slightly.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Metals: Flag Brand Tinplate Not Much Spot Inventory <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>Flag Brand tinplate is a high-grade type of new tinplate. Therefore, high-end printed cans and advertising signs must use Flag Brand tinplate. Although there are many substitutes from Germany, England, and France, the quality and properties of Flag Brand tinplate are superior. However, the price is also higher than other types. Therefore, its sales are not as active as other types. As a result, few traders in the market stock this product. Recently, the circulating inventory has suddenly become scarce. According to a survey, traders have not purchased this product for over half a year. Therefore, there have been no recent imports, causing prices to rise steadily. The current market prices are estimated at 16 yuan per box for 90 lbs, 31.75 yuan for 180 lbs, 17.5 yuan for 100 lbs, 34 yuan for 200 lbs, and 31.25 yuan for 170 lbs. It is reported that a total of 250-260 boxes were sold in the past two days, reportedly purchased by tin printing factories.</p>

<h3 id="e227">"A Miracle of Miracles" <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Ten years ago, I saw the Shanghai Drama Society's production of Ibsen's "A Doll's House," (using Ouyang Yuqian's adaptation). Ms. Wang Yuqing, who played Nora, was so empathetic that the audience was deeply moved. Everyone's ears echoed with the phrase "A miracle of miracles." Last week, I saw the Shanghai Amateur Dramatists' production of "A Doll's House." Ms. Lan Ping, who played Nora, was even better at portraying Nora's strong will, and the audience was even more moved. The phrase "A miracle of miracles" still lingered in everyone's ears. After waiting for ten or a hundred years, will this "miracle of miracles" truly appear? I have imagined this several times.</p>
<p>Nora says to Helmer, "When Krogstad's letter was in the mailbox, I never imagined that you would comply with his conditions. I thought you would definitely say to him, 'Go ahead and publish it!' After it was published, I thought you would definitely stand up and take all the blame yourself, saying, 'I did this.'" Helmer says, "I work for you every day, enduring poverty and hardship, and I am willing to do it all. But there is no man in the world who is willing to sacrifice his own reputation for the woman he loves." Suppose, Helmer had indeed stood up and taken all the blame himself. He was willing to sacrifice his own reputation for the woman he loved. If the miracle had indeed appeared, what would happen then? Could Nora live happily ever after? There was a young woman in England who was unfortunately raped by thugs. She appeared in court once. From then on, she became an outcast. Whether it was relatives or old friends, everyone avoided her as if she were a plague. Later, a young thinker sincerely fell in love with her and married her. But society was still that old society. The couple was forever an outcast couple, and they had no choice but to leave their hometown and hide in the valleys. So, even if the miracle did appear, society's rigid etiquette, traditional thinking, religious scriptures, and legal articles still stared at them with iron-faced condemnation. The couple would still have to compromise or escape.</p>
<p>Therefore, Nora no longer expects the appearance of a miracle. She expects that "miracle of miracles." Specifically, she believes that one day, rigid etiquette will be destroyed, traditional thinking will collapse, religious scriptures will be discarded, and legal articles will be changed. The current society will be completely transformed. Only then will the miracle of miracles truly appear. Nora says, "I believe that the most important thing is that I am a person, the same as you—or at least I want to try to be a person. I know that most people say the same thing as you, and that's what the books say. But from now on, I don't believe what most people and books say. I have to think about everything myself. I have to understand and know everything myself." This is a posture of defiance. She stands before the world and says, "I want to see if I'm wrong or if the world is wrong."</p>
<p>After Nora leaves, Helmer suddenly feels a glimmer of hope and says to himself, "Ah! The miracle of miracles?" This miracle of miracles is, of course, not only a hope for Nora, but also a hope for Helmer. However, if you sit on the coast watching the wind and clouds and refuse to steer the ship of life into the storms, how can you hope to reach the other shore? Whether it's Nora or Helmer, it's ultimately just an expectation. As I walked out of the Jincheng Theater, I felt a sense of emptiness in my chest.</p>
<h3 id="e228">東海記 <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— A Fertile Field</p>
<p>— Scraps Picked Up —</p>
<p>The Tale of the Eastern Sea, written by Wang Xi, whose courtesy name was Ji Xu, was published in the eleventh year of the Daoguang reign by the Wanlin Study. It elaborates on the story of the Filial Daughter-in-Law of the Eastern Sea from the Han Dynasty.</p>
<p>Details of Wang Xi's life are not widely known. What can be ascertained is that he was a fifth-generation descendant of the great painter Wang Yuanqi and the son-in-law of Zhang Huiyan and his brothers, renowned literati of Changzhou. Zhang Qi's courtesy name was Wanlin, and this book was engraved for him by his father-in-law. His wife was Zhang Wan'ying (Ruoqi), known as the smallest of the "Four Daughters of Kunling." His daughters, Wang Caiping (Jianxiang), Caiyao, Caizao, and Caiqin, were all capable of poetry, with Caiping being the most famous, hailed as a major figure among boudoir talents during the Xianfeng and Tongzhi reigns. Recent discussions of women's literature still mention Zhang Wan'ying and Wang Caiping, the mother and daughter, but their husbands or father have not been so fortunate, fading into obscurity despite leaving behind "The Tale of the Eastern Sea."</p>
<p>Tan Zhengbi's "Great Dictionary of Chinese Literature" states that Wang Xi died young. Wang Xi wrote "The Tale of the Eastern Sea" in the fifth year of the Daoguang reign, and when it was published in the eleventh year, he seemed to still be alive; otherwise, the preface and postscript would have mentioned it. Bao Shichen's preface, written nine years earlier, mentioned, "Ji Xu is from a scholarly family, and one day will emerge to govern the people." At that time, he seemed to be young and had not yet obtained scholarly honors. Zhang Wan'ying was likely born as early as the fourth or fifth year of the Jiaqing reign (since her third sister, Lunying, was born in the third year of the Jiaqing reign). They had already given birth to four daughters. Assuming the couple was of the same age or not far apart, Wang Xi likely died after the age of thirty-five, which cannot be considered very early. Wang Caiping's circumstances were also extremely bleak; it is said that her husband also died young.</p>
<p>"The Tale of the Eastern Sea" was commissioned by Zhou Luduan, the magistrate of Tancheng, to Wang Xi. Zhou was from Yanghu, likely due to their connections through the Zhang family. Before Wang Xi, there was already a "Tale of the Eastern Sea" play by a Chen from Shanyin, as mentioned in Bao's preface, Zhou's postscript, and the author's preface. It is now unknown whether any copies still exist. They both considered this book "not quite factual" or "not enough to stir up emotions," which was naturally a way to elevate Wang Xi's work. Bao's preface also said that Chen's work "mixed in methods of recent times, and its writing was not well-organized." Judging from the wording, it might not have been a Kunqu or Yiyang opera but rather a shadow puppet play, which is also possible.</p>
<p>Regarding plays with the Filial Daughter-in-Law of the Eastern Sea as a theme, there were already Yuan plays with the same title by Wang Shifu, Liang Jinzhi, and Wang Zhongyuan.</p>
<p>Eastern Sea Prefecture, Yu Gong Gao Dou</p>
<p>Unfortunately, all three of these are lost, and not a single copy has survived, preventing us from knowing their content. However, based on the title, it is clear that they all focused on Yu Gong, the capable official who judged the case, with the filial daughter-in-law seemingly not the main character. Guan Hanqing wrote a play titled</p>
<p>"The Injustice of Dou E Moves Heaven and Earth"</p>
<p>which exists today in the "Selected Yuan Plays." Guan was the originator of Yuan drama writers, so "The Injustice of Dou E" was likely written before the several plays about Yu Gong. Although it does not depict the events of the Filial Daughter-in-Law of the Eastern Sea, it was greatly influenced by this story and created separately. In the final verse of the third act, there are several lines that say, "Why has it not rained for three years? It is because of the injustice of the filial daughter-in-law in the Eastern Sea. Now it is your turn, Shanyang County." In the fourth act, Bao Tianzhang explained in detail to the state official: "In the past, during the Han Dynasty, there was a filial daughter-in-law who remained a widow. Her mother-in-law hanged herself, and the mother-in-law's daughter accused the filial daughter-in-law of killing her mother-in-law. The prefect of the Eastern Sea executed the filial daughter-in-law. Because of one woman's injustice, it did not rain for three years. Later, Yu Gong adjudicated the case and seemed to see the filial daughter-in-law holding a scroll and crying in front of the court. Yu Gong corrected the document and personally offered sacrifices at the filial daughter-in-law's tomb, and then it rained heavily. Today, your Chuzhou is experiencing a severe drought; is it not similar to this event?" The final lines of the play say, "Do not say that I am considering my deceased daughter to reduce her guilt, but I pity Chuzhou for the great drought of three years. In the past, Yu Gong vindicated the filial daughter-in-law of the Eastern Sea, and it was indeed a miracle that brought forth rain like a spring." The repeated references show that Guan intentionally used the story of the Filial Daughter-in-Law of the Eastern Sea as a basis. The section where the filial daughter-in-law holds a scroll and cries in front of the court is not mentioned in other books and serves as the basis for Bao Tianzhang examining the scroll and Bao E appearing as a spirit. We can further compare the story of the Filial Daughter-in-Law as recorded in the "Book of Han," "Records of Spirits," "Taiping Yulan," and other books with "The Injustice of Dou E" and list their similarities as follows:</p>
<p>Filial Daughter-in-Law of the Eastern Sea</p>
<p>Location: Present-day Zhengcheng, Shandong</p>
<p>Young widow</p>
<p>Suspected of killing her mother-in-law, who hanged herself</p>
<p>Wrongfully convicted and executed</p>
<p>Vowed innocence</p>
<p>Blood splattered on the banner pole</p>
<p>Snow fell in May</p>
<p>Drought for three years after death</p>
<p>Rain after offering sacrifices at the tomb</p>
<p>Dou E</p>
<p>Location: Present-day Huai'an, Jiangsu (not far away)</p>
<p>Young widow</p>
<p>Suspected of poisoning Zhang Lver's father</p>
<p>Wrongfully convicted and executed</p>
<p>Vowed innocence</p>
<p>Blood splattered on the flag spear and white silk</p>
<p>Snow fell in June</p>
<p>Drought for three years after death</p>
<p>Rain after clearing the injustice</p>
<p>Therefore, the story of Dou E is a modified and evolved version of the story of the Filial Daughter-in-Law of the Eastern Sea. The story of the filial daughter-in-law, as initially recorded in the "Book of Han," was very straightforward and simple. By the time of Gan Bao and others, there were already traces of gradual changes, such as the addition of the blood splattering on the banner pole. Probably during the Jin and Yuan dynasties, there were further additions, such as crying in the court while holding a scroll. In Guan's structure, several branches and characters were added; the killing of the mother-in-law was changed to the killing of an outsider, and the plot became more complex, with Zhang Lver and Sai Luyi appearing on stage. Yu Gong, the important figure in the original story, almost disappeared, seemingly partially transformed into Shi Dazhang, the protagonist's biological father. In this way, the focus shifted from Yu Gong to the tragic protagonist herself. The story became more active and showed greater power in expression. Later, Ye Xianzu and Yuan Yuling's "Tale of the Golden Lock" was a rewritten version of "The Injustice of Dou E," and the content underwent major changes: Zhang Lver's father was replaced by his mother, Dou E's husband, Cai Changzong, did not die, and Bao E ultimately saved her life at the critical moment because of the snowfall in June; the result was a happy ending, losing the tragic atmosphere. The "Snow in June" in present-day Peking opera is based on "Tale of the Golden Lock" and does not have much difference. As for being faithful to the original story, like those descended from the Yu Gong Gao Dou lineage, there is "The Tale of the Eastern Sea" discussed here.</p>
<p>After Guan Hanqing created Dou E, people often compared her to the Filial Daughter-in-Law of the Eastern Sea or confused them. The Zheng Huang County Gazetteer states that the filial daughter-in-law's surname was Dou (according to Wang Xi's preface), or even directly calls her Dou E (see Sun Xingyan's revised inscription for the Filial Daughter-in-Law Temple). Sun and Lu Jilu both believed that this was influenced by "watching opera" and "Yuan dynasty songs and plays." Bao Shichen also said: "The "Legend of June Snow" that has been passed down borrows the Filial Daughter-in-Law as a vehicle," which shows that the Filial Daughter-in-Law of the Eastern Sea and Dou E have almost merged into one. The Filial Daughter-in-Law's surname was originally Zhou, and marrying someone with the same surname was possible; insisting on the prohibition of marrying someone with the same surname as a blemish on the Filial Daughter-in-Law and forcefully arguing that it was not true, and only referring to Qingjie in the play without mentioning her surname, seems overly pedantic.</p>
<p>Wang's work consists of sixteen scenes. Because it is faithful to the original story, it is largely based on the aforementioned records in the "Book of Han," "Records of Spirits," and "Taiping Yulan," except for the scene "Reading in the Underworld," where the official who falsely accused the Filial Daughter-in-Law is punished, which is an unnecessary addition, there are not many changes or embellishments. Zhang Qi's postscript says: "It can be compared to Yun Ting and Qing Rong, and its successful parts directly approach Linchuan," praising it vigorously. Boosting his son-in-law is certainly understandable, but it feels like too much praise. However, compared to the mediocre Qing dynasty plays, it is not bad; for example, the tenth scene, "Dream Sensation," which describes the regret of the younger sister-in-law, and the eleventh scene, "Reporting the Drought," which satirizes the government, are both worth reading.</p>

<p>— By Stohan, Germany, translated by Chen Yinzhi</p>
<p>Nali pulled her hand back. We walked in silence toward the street with some restraint. Her house was at the end of that street. When we walked to the gate of the palace garden by the street, a group of people came toward us. From their loud voices, I recognized several of my most unruly school friends. We stopped unconsciously.</p>
<p>"Let's go through the garden!" I said.</p>
<p>"That's too far!"</p>
<p>"It's not much farther!"</p>
<p>We walked through the gate onto a wide road, which led to an arbor covered by cedar trees between low thorny hedges on both sides.</p>
<p>Here, on this side or that side of the short wall, there were only rounded bushes, without trees. Thus, the darkness of the return would not prevent me from seeing the girl walking next to me. She really came close to me in this quiet place now.</p>
<p>There seemed to be no one else in the old public garden except us. The garden was very quiet. Every step we took on the sand could be heard.</p>
<p>"Don't you want to hold my hand?" I asked.</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"No! - I'm afraid someone will come."</p>
<p>We came to the arbor of peach and elm trees formed in the shape of a dome.</p>
<p>It was very dark here, because there were arbors of this kind not far away on both sides, and the grass between the arbors was covered with bold shadows. I only knew that Nali was walking next to me because I could hear her breathing and light footsteps, but I couldn't see her. At this time, I suddenly remembered that I had gone out this afternoon to catch butterflies.</p>
<p>"Now you've been caught by me," I said. The darkness strengthened my courage, and I grabbed her drooping hand and held it tightly.</p>
<p>She let me hold her hand, but I felt her trembling, and my childlike heart jumped to my throat.</p>
<p>We walked slowly in the same way.</p>

<p>— Gao Zhi</p>
<p>The sun was setting. The heat of early July was gradually decreasing. The wind blowing in from the window made people feel light and cheerful. Gradually, dusk arrived.</p>
<p>The hustle and bustle of the day temporarily decreased, and the voices in the alley also became quieter. The sky, however, became lively. Red clouds, golden yellow clouds, and white clouds reflecting strong light moved slowly. The blue sky was high and clear. The rooftops of the city blocked the setting sun, but I deeply felt the infinitely good scenery of the sunset when I leaned by the window.</p>
<p>I finally sat down in the armchair with a slight sense of fatigue, leaning against it languidly, watching the screen of words blown by the wind, swaying slightly. The crossbar at the foot of the screen bumped against the wall, making a crisp sound. I silently stared at the light yellow wall, watching the dusk gradually envelop the thick dark color on the words on the screen. The dark shadows surged out from the top, bottom, and corners of the wall, like ambush soldiers, gradually extending from all around the room in a form of encirclement.</p>
<p>I lit a candle. The candlelight flickered in the breeze. The yellow flame existed weakly and lonely in the dark color of the deep twilight. The room was quiet and empty. The yellow flame of the candle and the darkness rushing out from the corners of the room were engaged in a solemn struggle, colliding and opposing each other.</p>
<p>I looked at the words on the screen, swaying gently. The words, once shrouded in the dark color after dusk, were illuminated a little by the yellow candlelight, but the words on the screen were still not very clear. I felt that the spirit of the friends in some of these words was alive on the paper.</p>
<p>I was silent, not thinking about anything. My eyes were open, but my heart was asleep. I existed in a semi-conscious state. Occasionally, faintly, I remembered the scene when I was reading with my late father fifteen or sixteen years ago. The yellow flame of the red wax candle wick swayed. In the solemn silence, I intermittently followed the sound of reciting the "Doctrine of the Mean" annotations, which seemed very silent. My father's occasional words were also very quiet.</p>
<p>This faint shadow flew away again. My heart was as empty as the night sky. There was not a sound in the house. I seemed to have forgotten my own existence.</p>
<p>The air of the early night blew in through the window. The corners of the room appeared darker. The yellow candle flame also appeared brighter. Looking at the screen of words, my heart slept more soundly.</p>
<p>I sat quietly in the flickering candlelight of the early night. Gradually, my eyelids also grew heavy. Outside the window, the noise of the city waved in the sky along with the neon lights reflected in the sky. The night grew deeper and deeper...</p>

<p>"You didn't even bother to check your throat when it was feeling uncomfortable?"</p>
<p>"Check?" The medical student, who had not yet received his mortarboard, was a little embarrassed and angry. "What are you nagging about? Just believe me. Check, checking requires a special appointment!" He snorted through his nose, as if this sentence could stop someone's mouth.</p>
<p>"You said there's nothing wrong, but the child has lost so much weight in the past few days. Does weight loss come from nothing?" The wife retorted, "You're trying to scare people with special appointments. It's not like we can't afford a special appointment, but it's not worth hiring a master like you!"</p>
<p>The medical student became a little anxious because other patients were staring at him intently, and beads of sweat appeared on his face. He slapped the table.</p>
<p>"Go, go quickly, don't act crazy here. Go to a mental hospital for treatment."</p>
<p>I was very unhappy. Although the wife's words were excessive, they were not wrong! Moreover, she was probably the only one among the group of patients who dared to say it. Others, even though they were indignant inside, would still call him "Doctor" to please him a little so that he would examine them more carefully. Doctors should take treating patients seriously, but treating them so hastily and unreasonably goes against the purpose of saving people. I also felt sorry for my wife. I continued:</p>
<p>"Doctor, don't be angry. You haven't worn your mortarboard yet, so you're too hot-tempered. Don't look down on these patients. If these patients didn't come to see you, what would you expect to live on in the future? These people are your customers. You're selling goods, not putting on airs and getting angry."</p>
<p>He became even angrier, jumped up, and waved his white coat sleeves, trying to grab me, intending to drag me out, but when he really grabbed my shoulder, I threw him off balance, almost making him fall. The nurse panicked, but she still spoke up for the hospital.</p>
<p>"What are you doing? You want to hit someone? Report to the director!"</p>
<p>She pressed the bell, and the bell rang loudly.</p>
<p>I didn't care at all. They were putting on a show. I understood, but unfortunately, I wasn't afraid.</p>
<p>"Report to the director?" I said calmly, "These patients are my witnesses! Who made the first move? Make a move? You can't beat me! I was an athlete at school. I practiced boxing. Even if you add ten or eight more, you're no match! You can treat illnesses, but you can't treat other people's strength! The director? I know him. It's better if he comes, so I don't have to go find him to report your misdeeds! I'll wait here. You do what you want." This near-thuggish behavior unexpectedly frightened the two bullies. In the end, the future medical student came up to apologize.</p>
<p>We didn't just want him to apologize. We really hated their rudeness! We always felt that they treated patients too impolitely. People come to the hospital to treat illnesses, but instead, they get angry.</p>
<p>"Are you preparing for a special appointment this afternoon?"</p>
<p>After leaving the hospital, my wife asked me.</p>
<p>"I'm angry, but we still need to see a doctor. We can only wait until this afternoon," I replied, feeling very sad. "It's good that we can afford a special appointment, but what about others who can't afford a special appointment? Won't they still be insulted by them?"</p>
<p>"I hope everyone gets sick less often."</p>
<p>"Then you might as well hope that doctors put on a more amiable face."</p>
<p>In the evening, seeing that the child's illness had not improved, my wife grabbed my hand and said with a smile:</p>
<p>"Would it be good if I studied medicine?"</p>

<h3 id="e232">Eden's "Relying on Heaven's Will" <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Yin</p>
<p>I can't remember where I heard someone say that this year is the "Year of Travel Diplomacy." This statement seems quite apt; this year, the diplomatic activities of various countries do indeed seem to be adopting this trend of travel diplomacy, such as MacDonald's visit to Italy, Simon Eden's visits to Germany, Poland, and Russia, and Laval's envoys to Moscow… these long journeys of diplomatic figures are indeed rare events that have not been seen for several years. Conversely, conference diplomacy seems particularly deserted this year, and the League of Nations headquarters can almost be described as desolate.</p>
<p>Eden, this elegant young man, is the most active member of the "Year of Travel Diplomacy." The road he has traveled is also particularly longer than others. He has just returned from Berlin, then went to Warsaw and Moscow. Recently, he was again ordered to travel to Paris and Rome. Moreover, he will once again go to Berlin to meet Hitler.</p>
<p>Logically, this elegant and youthful "traveling diplomat" should have been the most likely candidate to obtain the position of Foreign Secretary in this change of the British cabinet. But in the end, he lost the selection due to his age and experience. This truly makes us feel sorry for this elegant young man.</p>
<p>But this is not very important. "The future is long," so we will wait and see what he does in the future! Therefore, we must see his diplomatic activities after the establishment of the new cabinet.</p>
<p>Now, he has actually gone to Rome for the Abyssinian affair, haggling with the Blackshirt Premier Mussolini about the East African transaction. What will be the result? Heaven knows!</p>
<p>However, from his conversation, he did reveal some things, but the most mysterious thing is that he said this: "The result of this trip," "Everything should be left to Heaven's will." This "relying on Heaven's will" seems to have lightly hinted at so many difficulties and hardships.</p>
<p>When Italy is urgently deploying military forces, these three words "relying on Heaven's will" can easily reveal some gunpowder smell. However, this is not just Eden's unlucky trip. I think the biggest misfortune still lies in the weak and poor country of Abyssinia.</p>
<p>Now, Eden has again obtained the consent of French Premier and Foreign Minister Laval: "Not to obstruct the British and German solution to the situation." Then, Eden's return trip to Berlin should be a little smoother. If it is not again "relying on Heaven's will," perhaps Hitler's iron arm will pull him, pointing east and actively using gunpowder to do a "man-made" "solution"!</p>
<p>Because of this, we are reminded of the diplomatic travels before the First World War.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Classification of Eyes <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Rong</p>
<p>Once, I had an eye disease and went to a specialist ophthalmologist for treatment. After the examination, he said that it was not very serious, and I felt relieved. At the same time, I saw many strange and bizarre eye charts on his walls. He pointed to them and explained them to me, telling me that people's eyes are divided into several types. He said so much, and the diagrams were so complex, that I couldn't remember anything clearly. By the time I left the door, I had already forgotten everything he had said. Only the red, purple, blue, and yellow colorful colors still hadn't disappeared from my eyes, leaving a vague impression in my mind.</p>
<p>From then on, I knew that the physiological structure of human beings was not as simple and uniform as we had always imagined. Just take the very small thing of eyes. They can be divided into several types, but this is what we have neglected in our daily lives.</p>
<p>Later, I told my idea to a friend. He couldn't help laughing and said that I was too bookish, saying that eyes can only be divided into two types: black eyes of Chinese people and blue eyes of Westerners. This is an undeniable fact. Creating many other names and diagrams is a waste of energy and pointless worrying. I was speechless after being refuted by him, because his words were not without reason. So, I silently agreed.</p>
<p>A seemingly vague thing can still be found a clear sign. Taking his words as an example, haven't we already found a criterion for distinction from that dogmatic argument? "Color"! That's the strange thing! One is black, and the other is blue. Is there anything clearer, more obvious, and more reasonable than this fact? I didn't believe in the most ordinary, superficial, and well-known thing, but I wanted to believe in the nonsense of the ophthalmologist. Just like what he said, I was "pointlessly worrying." Thinking of this, I couldn't help but chuckle to myself.</p>
<p>After that, I always kept this belief. Living in this cosmopolitan city where Chinese and foreigners live together, there are many opportunities for me to experiment. After looking at some Westerners, and then looking at some Chinese and Japanese people, I made my meaning even stronger. There are two types of eyes: one is black, and the other is blue. This is as true as one plus one equals two. This is an unquestionable reality!</p>
<p>But after I mingled in this sea of people for a few years, my idea began to waver. I gradually doubted myself, because although human eyes can be classified, the classification is definitely not as simple as I imagined. Just relying on the surface color of the eyeballs for observation makes the argument too superficial and wrong. Isn't it? Why, in my short experience of the world, have I discovered many eyes that cannot be simply described as black or blue?</p>
<p>A person's will may sink day by day due to worldly affairs, but thoughts become clearer day by day. Through continuous observation, I found a criterion that can be used to classify eyes. Only this criterion is the most reliable. This is: favorable and unfavorable glances.</p>
<p>To say favorable and unfavorable glances is not actually a difference in surface color. The difference between them can be observed from a person's expression and attitude. For example, if you are a poor young man with no status, no property, and no reputation, then no matter where you go, you can see unfavorable glances, and this observation is not due to your color blindness. Conversely, if you are a high-ranking official, a wealthy businessman, or a famous celebrity with status, property, and reputation, then no matter where you go, all the glances cast at you are favorable. Those below you flatter you, those above you praise you, women show affection for you, and colleagues are polite to you. All around you is this warm spring breeze. You would never think that you were born in a cold and indifferent universe. Sometimes, a person can encounter both types of glances in a lifetime. Down-and-outs see favorable glances first and then unfavorable glances. Upstarts see unfavorable glances first and then favorable glances. At the same time, it is not that one type of person has unfavorable glances and another type of person has favorable glances. Every person can have both types of eyes at the same time, so that they can be used separately when they see people with different status, property, and reputation. Moreover, this method of classification transcends the categories of ancient and modern China and foreign countries, straddling the core of our social life, so it is the most appropriate method of classification. Don't believe it? Please try it at the crossroads!</p>
<p>I think that in the future, the chapter on "Eyes" in physiology textbooks should add a sentence: "Eyes are divided into favorable and unfavorable glances, which change according to the economic status of the person being looked at."</p>
<h3 id="e234">Old Boatman <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Xinye</p>
<p>The crew moored the boat to the shore and secured the ropes, waiting for all the passengers to walk off the gangplank onto the dock. Then, everyone busied themselves unloading cargo, while the old boatman sat on the deck of the aft cabin, leaning against the rudder post and smoking his dry tobacco pipe.</p>
<p>The boat was extremely busy, unloading cargo, sweeping the hold, lowering the sails, taking down the masts, setting up the awning, starting the rudder, covering the base, etc., and a young crew member was preparing to cook dinner.</p>
<p>"The weather today is probably unreliable. I think we should</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>unfurl the tarpaulin first!" The old boatman looked at the sky and saw a layer of dark gray clouds plastered across it, realizing that it was a sign of impending rain.</p>
<p>This port used to be very lively. For example, when the old boatman was young, he worked as a leading crew member on a passenger-cargo boat and later became the boss. At that time, there were always more than a dozen passenger-cargo boats docked in this port. But now it was as desolate as death. Apart from this dilapidated boat that still frequently came and went, almost no boats would enter this port to dock. Moreover, the port was about a mile or so away from the town, with earthen hills on both sides, and there was a muddy road along the bank. When it rained, it was extremely slippery, but the old boatman didn't have his own dock, so he had to moor here. There was a dilapidated pavilion at the end of the port, and the boat also docked there lonely.</p>
<p>The sky gradually darkened, and a mast lamp was lit in the boat. Under the dim and feeble light, they sat together and began to eat dinner.</p>
<p>It started to rain; the tarpaulin made a crisp and rhythmic sound, weaving a heart-stirring melody in the quiet night.</p>
<p>"Close the mast window! Didn't I expect it? I predicted it would rain tonight!" The old boatman held a bowl of rice in his hand, but he suddenly stopped the chopsticks he was using to shovel rice, pointing at a young crew member and saying this.</p>
<p>That night, the old boatman slept in the cabin and couldn't fall asleep no matter what. He thought about how, apart from this dilapidated boat, he had nothing else to his name! He was now fifty-eight years old, and he had spent forty years of his life on the water. And now he was a lonely, wandering old man without a home. He remembered that five years ago, at this time, he still had a dilapidated home. Although his wife had been dead for nearly ten years, he had a son who was almost twenty years old. Even though he had such a grown child, it couldn't immediately give him peace, but at least it could share some of his burden. Who knew that heaven didn't have eyes, and his only son had died of cholera in the summer of the year before last! Now he relied on this dilapidated boat to make a living, going east today and west tomorrow, drifting on the water for three hundred and sixty days a year. However, this boat was just like him, old and tired, and somewhat unable to move. Moreover, because it had been in disrepair for a long time, not only had the paint peeled off, but many places were leaking water, and a tarpaulin was torn and couldn't hold out the wind. If it were to sail on a wider river, as long as it encountered wind and waves, there would be some unexpected dangers. However, he himself understood this, so he always said:</p>
<p>"This boat is really pitifully old, and it can't be dragged on without repairs! But business has been so slow lately that even covering the cost of fuel is not enough. How can I afford to go ashore? If this boat were to go ashore for repairs, I think it would cost at least four or five hundred dollars...!" He had been saying these words for three or four years, and he didn't know how many hundreds of times he had said them. But until today, it still hadn't gone ashore once. Not to mention going ashore, he hadn't even given it a coat of tung oil.</p>
<p>He felt a bit sad, and his eyes couldn't help but become watery. He thought that he would soon sink to the bottom of the water together with this dilapidated boat!</p>
<p>"Leak! Leak! The bottom of the boat is taking on water!" He was still thinking when he was interrupted by a panicked cry.</p>
<p>"Where?" Although he knew that there were already holes everywhere in this boat, he still asked this question.</p>
<p>"In the cargo hold, there's water in the main hold!"</p>
<p>"It's leaking in the mast cabin and the stern!"</p>
<p>"What to do!" He had already gotten up from the cabin, hearing the sound of rain still beating on the tarpaulin, and the base was all wet from the leaks. Looking at the water at the bottom of several cabins, gurgling and flowing inside, he stood there helplessly, watching the water bubble up more and more, accumulating deep under the cabin.</p>
<p>"What to do?" He wrung his hands, paced back and forth on the deck a few times, and scratched his head, but he couldn't think of a way to remedy the situation!</p>
<p>The crew members were busy using things to plug the holes, but there were too many leaks, how could they plug them all?</p>
<h3 id="e235">The Story of Sister Ming <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Da Yun</p>
<p>The sky was the color of fish belly, clouds were flying slowly, and a half-round moon hung in the middle of the sky, hazy and without luster. The world seemed to be in a state of stillness.</p>
<p>The kitchen was so dim, dark and lifeless. At this time, Sister Ming quietly walked down the ladder, rustling, passing through the kitchen, and turned on the electric light. The shimmering, low-intensity red light shone on her sallow and thin face, clearly revealing two small mountain-peak-like protruding cheekbones, and a pair of bulging eyes like goldfish eyes. Her hair was disheveled, like a pile of weeds covering the top of her head, and insufficient sleep made her pair of bulging eyes show a lazy fatigue.</p>
<p>When she felt that her work was busy and she was getting more and more bogged down, she often secretly shed tears, sighed, and complained about her unfortunate fate.</p>
<p>Before Sister Ming married into the Hu family, because there were too many sisters in her family, and she was born with a not-so-clever tongue and was not good at flattering elders, she often failed to win the favor of her elders. Therefore, the people in her family were prejudiced against her everywhere. Fortunately, she was able to see things in the world with an open mind and did not harbor resentment, so she did not feel the bitterness of being discriminated against in the slightest. However, although her temperament disregarded everything, she had never liked to laugh since she was born, which symbolized that she had embarked on a world of sorrow.</p>
<p>It was said that before her mother gave birth to her, everything in the family was going smoothly. However, in the year that she came into this world, her strong mother fell seriously ill and lay in bed for more than ten days, living a life of torment. This made her doubt Sister Ming, and when she sought divination from gods and asked fortune-tellers, they all said that Sister Ming's "eight characters" were too strong and would not bring blessings to her parents. That year also happened to be a flood year. The embankment in front of the village was breached by the flood, and the boundless rice fields in front of and behind the village instantly became a sea of ​​floods. The villagers all felt that a natural disaster was coming, and everyone was frowning and worried. In this depressing atmosphere, she almost became the object of blame for the whole family, like a prisoner being beaten, scolded, ridiculed, and venting their boredom, no one would sympathize with her, pity her!</p>
<p>When Sister Ming grew up, she felt that she didn't get along with her sisters. She always did the rough and miscellaneous housework all day long by herself, and when she was free, she would walk alone to the edge of the field, sit under a big tree, and stare at the blue in the gaps between the leaves, feeling bored. From afar, she heard her father's habitual cackling cough, and she suddenly stood up and ran home. That ancient big tree was her only friend and harmonious companion when she was a child. She didn't seem to have any more requests for everything.</p>
<p>When she was eighteen years old, her parents finally fulfilled their responsibility and married her to Brother Ming in the village. At that time, she longed for a happy life in a new environment after marriage, and Brother Ming's cleverness and ability. This pleasant longing swirled in her mind until she married into Brother Ming's family.</p>
<p>However, Brother Ming was not as clever and capable as she had imagined, because he had been spoiled by his parents since he was a child, and he had been taken care of with meticulous care, turning him into a fool.</p>
<p>Since Sister Ming felt the shortcomings of her husband, all her new hopes became castles in the air. The hardships of life were even more burdensome than at home. Her magnanimous temperament had gradually contained a sad mood, and now she was a mother with three children. Her strong body was exhausted little by little. She didn't have the same stupid energy as before, and she fully realized the sadness.</p>
<p>When she saw her children sleeping soundly on the bed, she secretly got out of bed and walked down the ladder, rustling, preparing to do her inexhaustible work. Her tired eyes stared at the hazy moon outside the window and the slowly moving clouds in the gray sky in a daze. Besides, everything was silent, and the world seemed to be asleep.</p>
<h3 id="e236">A Short Farewell to Penang <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Qin</p>
<p>The train, like spewing black smoke, departed from the Western Branch Station at 7:15 a.m. The station faded away in the warmth of the morning sun! I stood by the window, glancing back at the bustling and hot Penang, which had transformed into a clear yet blurred, surreal world. In this world, only a pair of dark eyes remained! A deep glow reflected in front of me. I felt a surge of joy, or perhaps it was melancholy, as I bid a short farewell to Penang.</p>
<p>I love to travel. Travel not only provides me with a change from the stifling and unclean air, but it also actively strengthens my mind and body. The grandeur of nature, the sensitivity of humanity - the moment I board the train, I smell the scent of coal smoke, and I feel an indescribable joy. For many days, I felt like a caged bird, unable to fly freely to the world I longed for.</p>
<p>Stepping onto the train, what made me happy and excited was not just the new environment that was about to arrive, but also the thread of memories that unfolded so warmly before my eyes! Ah! How many feelings of sadness and joy had accumulated at this Western Branch Station! Now, this was the third time I was bidding it a short farewell.</p>
<p>Until the train departed, the eight-seat carriage remained empty, with only me. I felt a sense of tranquility, as if I were in my own residence, but also a slight sense of loneliness without a travel companion! I placed my suitcase on the luggage rack, along with the small paper umbrella I carried. I stared at them for a long time. They were now my only close companions on this short journey!</p>
<p>The train sped along. Outside the window flew by some wild scenery on the eastern outskirts of Penang, with trees shading some tall buildings. What attracted my attention the most was the large white advertisement for "Gu Bo" wine that peeked through the trees. Human perception is truly strange. Now, even these white characters could evoke a sense of familiarity, prompting me to recall some fond memories of Penang. I looked out the window and could hardly suppress a smile.</p>
<p>"Is this seat taken, miss?" A sudden sentence in Singaporean Mandarin startled me. I turned to see a local young woman standing at the carriage door, asking with a charming smile, "Excuse me, miss."</p>
<p>"No, no, please feel free to sit down. If you'd like to come into this carriage," I replied in the local language.</p>
<p>"Okay, thank you!" she said, then turned away. In less than two minutes, she brought her suitcase over and sat in a seat by the window opposite me. She carefully and cautiously placed the small suitcase by the window, leaned her head against the window panel, and closed her eyes. Of course, I dared to believe that she was not trying to sleep; she was doing so to conceal the secrets of her fantasies, I thought.</p>
<p>"Where are you going, miss?" She suddenly opened her eyes and asked me. I was completely unprepared for her to strike up a conversation with me, although locals are most fond of chatting with strangers, so this easily answered question actually made me feel embarrassed.</p>
<p>"Are you going to Poli? You should go once. The scenery there is not bad!" she continued.</p>
<p>"I'm going to Bukit Mertajam," I said. "Are you going to Kuala Lumpur?"</p>
<p>"No, I'm going to Nashong River. I still have to change to a public bus. I went to Poli last year. It only takes two hours."</p>
<p>There was silence in the carriage, but a moment's conversation had made my heart feel warm. We tasted the most comfortable moment of life in silence. At this time, everyone was looking out the window. It turned out that it had started to rain outside!</p>

<p>Opening Passage: "Peach Blossom Fan"</p>
<p>Liu Sheng eloquently spoke of rise and fall, a famous scholar, emulating the madness of Chu. Gold and powder floated, the flowing water passed, unbearable past events evoke vicissitudes. Imagine that, a handsome young Marquis, forlorn in a lodging, leaving his hometown, only loving the moon above Meixiang Tower, drunk on the spring scenery of Moling. And see that, Xiangjun, peerless beauty, eloquent tongue, especially him, Hou Fangyu, favored by the Marquis' discerning eyes, a tune on the pipa, expressing tender feelings. Suddenly, banners and drums, the sound of war drums began to move, the vast Yangtze River at dusk. Alas, the royal aura of Jinling exhausted, a bloody wind swept down on Yangzhou in ten days. At that time, the Donglin Party, evil ministers and traitors, state affairs were in chaos, disaster arose. Joyfully unaware of the pain of national subjugation, singing and dancing to please the monarch every day. That Xiangjun, refusing the summons to sing, who knew that her beautiful brows concealed a chivalrous heart, a brocade inscription passed on a palace fan, my heart will never fail Marquis Hou. Only see that, bloodstains on the peach blossom fan, a belly full of grievances, the melody is empty, leaving the weeping willows of Baimen, the green mountains still shining on the setting sun. Listen to him, Jingting's sandalwood clapper, Kun opera music, each playing their sad strings, turning out new words to sing the Wheat Song, undulating and drumming Yuyang. Sometimes, accompanied by fishermen and woodcutters, singing throughout the long Jiangnan melody. Only hear that, the singing is all desolate.</p>

<p>Fengming Advertising Agency, Rose Radio Station Mr. and General Affairs Director Hua Zhenya are enthusiastic young people in social undertakings. Now, in view of the fact that the summer season has arrived, and epidemics are rampant, most of which are caused by the citizens' negligence of hygiene, resulting in disasters. For the sake of the present, to avoid this disaster, it is necessary to awaken the citizens' attention to hygiene. Therefore, it was decided on the 21st of the lunar calendar to jointly organize a grand hygiene movement broadcasting conference with well-known national medical groups, senior comedic writers, the three major singing groups "Shanghai Society", "Mingyue Society", and "Nightingale Society" of Shanghai, as well as famous actors and amateurs. Mayor Wu and famous people in Shanghai were also invited to give speeches. It is expected that there will be a lively event that will benefit the citizens a lot.</p>

<p>Zhou Jianyun and Hu Die's Return to Shanghai Album</p>
<p>Zhou Jianyun and his wife and Ms. Hu Die landed at the Sanma Road New Customs Wharf at 8:30 AM on the 8th. There were about 2,000 welcomers and more than 40 cars. Zhou and Hu shook hands and nodded to the welcomers, and then took a car directly to the Mingxing Company in Fenglinqiao for rest.</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM, a large reed shed was set up in the photography field, with more than 1,000 seats. The welcome meeting was opened by all the actors and actresses. Yuan Ludeng, Zhang Shichuan, Zheng Zhengqiu, and Dong Tianya were elected as the presidium. In addition to all the company members, there were also reporters from various newspapers, and Zhou and Hu's close friends attended the welcome.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Zhongying, the director-general of the Central Film Department, came to Shanghai to welcome them. He went to the ship to greet them in the morning, and in the afternoon, he attended the welcome meeting and delivered a speech. His words were quite sincere, which showed that the Central Government attached great importance to Zhou and Hu's trip abroad.</p>
<p>Zhou Jianyun reported on his travels around the world, which lasted for three hours and was not finished. The listeners were all moved. Due to time constraints, the meeting did not close until 7:00 PM. After the meeting, the guests went to the reception room for tea and snacks, and the company members received a piece of paper.</p>
<p>Cheng Bugao's sound masterpiece "Tuberose", starring Hu Die, has some unfinished shots. Miss Hu will start to finish it after a few days of rest, and it is scheduled to meet the audience during the best period.</p>
<p>It is said that the seventh issue of Mingxing Bimonthly is to welcome Zhou and Hu's published texts and report to readers. It is expected that the sales of the seventh issue of the magazine will be even better.</p>

<p>That night, the Yi Hua Company resounded with drums and gongs, and firecrackers popped from time to time. In the photography studio, hundreds of mercury lamps blazed brightly. A magnificent 19th-century wealthy man’s residence—Shang Guanwu's—occupied the entirety of the studio, a sprawling 160 feet in length and 80 feet in width, the largest of its kind in China. In front of the main entrance stood a multi-colored archway. The courtyard was lined with nameplates of officials from bygone eras. The grand hall was filled with congratulatory scrolls, longevity peaches, longevity cakes, octagonal lanterns... while the stage showcased a performance of "Heavenly Blessing." Director Ying Yunwei orchestrated the actors' movements, Zhou Ke adjusted camera angles and lighting, and Fang Peilin busied himself with set design and props. Beads of sweat trickled down everyone's faces in the 98.4-degree heat.</p>
<p>Two hundred and fifty extras played male guests. Another two hundred and fifty played female guests. The sounds of congratulatory wishes were incessant.</p>
<p>The birthday star, Shang Guanwu, radiated joy. General Zhang—Zhang Zhizhi—who once commanded awe, also brought his niece—Hu Ping—to offer birthday greetings, making the birthday star even more honored.</p>
<p>Eat up, don't be shy, have another cup. Blessings of full fortune, the Eight Immortals celebrating longevity...</p>
<p>At three o'clock in the morning, the mercury lamps dimmed their brilliance.</p>

<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Film is a great miracle of modern scientific invention. In addition to entertainment, it also has an educational function. The United States boasts the most developed film industry in the world. Its manufacturing headquarters are in Hollywood. This is almost universally known. After the United States, England and Germany are next. Although Soviet Russia is working hard at this emerging industry, it is far behind England and the United States in comparison. Film art can not only cultivate emotions and increase interest in life, but its contribution to science and commerce should not be ignored. Now, let’s just talk about its relationship with the automotive industry to illustrate the importance of film and commerce.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Lowe, manager of the British Carvel Film Company, the effect of factual films can be roughly divided into three points: (1) Promoting the sale of goods. Before a product is marketed, it must obtain a clear understanding and belief in the product from buyers and distributors. If a salesman explains to buyers the manufacturing process, machinery, and factory conditions of a product, it is useless to rely on oral explanations alone. In the difficult situation where machines and factories cannot follow the salesmen around, the only way is to rely on films. (2) To teach dealers and salesmen to clearly understand the production process of goods, and how to find sales markets and deal with various customers. (3) General promotion in business, maintaining the credibility and reputation of goods. When a new product is launched on the market, it serves as a universal promotion.</p>
<p>The manufacturing situation of automobiles, the convenience and comfort of driving, and various improvements can all be shown to the public on the screen, arousing and reminding their attention. There are many examples of increased sales as a result. The Ford Motor Company is a good example. They have used films, and in the past one or two years, they have sold between 75,000 and 100,000 vehicles. The film "Steel Praise" attracted public attention and appreciation at the Chicago Century of Progress Exhibition. A recent film, called "These Thirty Years," based on a novel by the famous novelist Fieldstone, has been welcomed by distributors and the public. This film has received critical acclaim and has been selected as one of the seven best films of the month by the American Motion Picture Producers and Distributors Preview Committee.</p>
<p>Goodrich tires have also been selling well thanks to films. In 1934, sales increased by US$1,000,000 compared to 1933. Employees of the company said that this was due to film publicity. Because after the distributors watched this kind of film, they could find ways to obtain greater sales and more satisfactory service for customers. The famous Saint Kaistal oranges and Guming Flag oranges have always had good annual sales. Since the California Fruit Growers Exchange used films to promote them, after the merchants and employees in Bridgeport watched their film "Partnership for Profit," they sold three and a half trainloads of oranges in ten days, twice as many as in the past. In Detroit's various fruit shops, the center of the automotive industry, 32,000 pieces of orange and lemon drinks were sold in one week. The sales of one company, Bergval, increased from 246 boxes per week to 1,203 boxes per week. The business of Roche Brothers in New York increased by about 200%. The power of film on sales is really not small.</p>
<p>American automobile companies have produced many industrial films. The more notable ones are Ford's "Steel Praise," Audi Hua's "These Thirty Years," Caravel's products, Nash Company's products, Burton Holmes's products, Gitteri's products, Harn Thai's products, General Motors' Chevrolet's products, Harn Thai's products, Walters Maple's products, and the producers are the same. Goodrich's two films are mostly exported by Caravel. In addition, there are various films from Fisher Body, Strongbin Faser, Hudson, and Chrysler.</p>
<p>A well-made industrial film should be viewed by at least hundreds of thousands to one million people, and the results obtained are all accurate. It is estimated that at least 10,000,000 people have watched Ford's "These Thirty Years" mentioned above. Because this brand is not only screened at the Chicago Century of Progress Exhibition, but also often screened in ordinary cinemas.</p>
<p>American industrial film manufacturers are all experienced experts and are the orthodox of Hollywood. Therefore, the director, set design, lighting, and sound recording are all taken seriously during the production. A good industrial film must also have a perfect script. Ford's "These Thirty Years" was written by a writer. No wonder it can attract the largest number of people. Today's industrial films are much more advanced than before. It is by no means just a film that records the working conditions of the factory. It must be able to grasp the psychology of the audience and arouse their appreciation in order to achieve the final desired purpose.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Muddy Motor Company Celebrates 15th Anniversary <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>Special Publication of Exquisite Commemorative Album</p>
<p>American Muddy Motor Company, located at the corner of Edward Road and Sichuan Road, is publishing an exquisite booklet this year to celebrate its 15th anniversary. During these 15 years, most large and small automobile dealers have either reorganized or closed down. However, Muddy Motor Company has been making steady progress and developing since its inception 15 years ago. Today, it has become one of the giants among car dealers in China. Of the car companies that started earlier than Muddy, only two still exist today.</p>
<p>Muddy Motor Company is known for its sound organization, thoughtful service, enthusiasm, perseverance, and courageous spirit. Therefore, the company takes the lead in participating in all activities that benefit the automotive industry in China, and it always does its best. There are many aspects in which the company is recognized as the best by the world:</p>
<p>1.  It was the first to set up an "indoor" gas station at the corner of Edward Road and Sichuan Road. Since then, other companies have followed suit.</p>
<p>2.  It was the first to build a large showroom to display passenger cars and trucks. The building (corner of Edward Road and Sichuan Road) is still the largest showroom in China, with a capacity to display 22 large cars.</p>
<p>3.  It was the first to build a sawtooth-style sunlit house, which has been the largest car repair shop in China for many years. Since then, many buildings with the same structure have been built, all modeled after it.</p>
<p>4.  Muddy started the first car repair pit in China.</p>
<p>5.  It was the first to ship hydraulic lifting and high-pressure lubricating machines to China for application.</p>
<p>6.  Muddy started the first specially constructed and equipped crane car repair truck in Shanghai.</p>
<p>7.  It was the first to establish installment payment methods and advertise them in newspapers. (Its slogan was: "Why walk when you can pay in installments?")</p>
<p>8.  Muddy was the first to use neon lights and car billboards. The company still owns two neon car billboards, which are the largest in China.</p>
<p>9.  "Service after the sale" and "Cars that suit everyone's financial resources and needs" were first invented by Muddy and have been widely imitated for ten years.</p>
<p>10. Muddy was the first to start exploring and complete the car travel route between Qingdao and Zhifu. (The trip took a total of two and a half days. Afterwards, the highway was built along this route, which is convenient for travelers. The mileage is less than six hours.)</p>
<p>11. Muddy was the first to explore and complete the round-trip car route between Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Nanjing.</p>
<p>12. It was the first to bring "family travel cars" to China and the first to travel around China in this car.</p>
<p>In addition, there are three other aspects in which Muddy was the first. However, Mr. Muddy, the general manager of the company, is very modest and does not want to reveal them to the world. Therefore, these items are all related to himself.</p>
<p>Muddy Motor Company has been appointed as the agent in China for Packard Motor Company since 1923. Since 1924, it has been appointed as the agent for Chrysler Motor Company. Since 1925, it has been the agent for Lever Motor Company. Since 1927, it has been the agent for Shunfeng Motor Company. Since 1929, it has been the agent for Di Sado and Hoggo trucks. Most recently, the company was appointed as the agent for Kanghai Diesel trucks. It is said that this new car will soon be offered to the world.</p>
<p>Muddy Company's business covers the whole of China, and its business scope is very wide, including the sales, storage, and repair of various passenger cars and commercial transport vehicles. Its scale and strength have long been well known. The company's director and general manager is Mr. Muddy, and the deputy general manager is Mr. Smith. As for the sales manager, it is Mr. Heslin. One of the issues that Mr. Muddy is most concerned about in his life is how to promote the construction of good roads in various parts of China. He has been working hard on this for the past 15 years, and he has never slackened. This enthusiasm is especially admired by the people of the time. On the occasion of the company's 15th anniversary, someone asked him to briefly describe his feelings. He said, "Since the establishment of the company 15 years ago, thanks to my colleagues, most of whom are shareholders of the company, who have dedicated their wisdom and loyalty and helped with perseverance, the company has been able to gradually progress and develop day by day to reach its current position. This is what I deeply admire. In the future, if the company and my colleagues can continue to work hard in the spirit of the past to seek development and share benefits, it is what I especially desire."</p>
<h3 id="e246">1935 Graham New Car <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>The automobile market in 1935 was filled with a large number of low-priced vehicles. This may be due to the decline in public purchasing power. Therefore, this year's Groham new car certainly cannot escape the words "cheap and good." The new car's wheelbase is 111 inches wide. The engine is a six-cylinder type, 3 inches by 4 inches, with a cylinder head in the form of a cylinder. The total cylinder capacity is 169.6 cubic inches. The engine horsepower is 60 horsepower. The number of revolutions per minute is 3,500 revolutions. The weight of the four-door sedan is 2,700 pounds. This 1935 new car has countless advantages. Not only is the price very self-denying, but the regular goods are also very cheap. Its gasoline consumption is very economical. According to the manufacturer's report after the test, it is said that it can travel 26 miles to 16 miles per gallon of gasoline. The latter number is the record when the car is traveling at a speed of 70 miles per hour. In addition to the six-cylinder car, there are special six-cylinder, eight-cylinder, and super eight-cylinder types of the 1935 Graham car. However, their models are still the 1934 type. Only minor improvements have been made. The body has also been improved a lot. The internal dimensions of these three cars are the same as last year. But the low-priced six-cylinder car is slightly different. Its internal length and width have been slightly reduced. The radiator grid has been changed to a very narrow one. The panels are also very suitable for streamlining. The slope of the rear panel is greater than last year. These are just the most obvious improvements on the outside. The rear of the new car is very spacious. Except for the four-door sedan, the spare wheel can be hidden in the rear box. This can improve the streamlining of the body.</p>
<p>The frame is more solid. The X-shaped frame has been improved again. The two legs of the front part are extended longer and fixed on the side beam. Then it changes to the inside. It must also be connected with a horizontal plate to form a K shape. It is extremely strong.</p>
<p>The spring device has not changed much from last year's style. It is installed outside the side beam. The force of the front spring is 152 pounds per inch. The force of the rear spring is 120 pounds per inch. From the eccentric drum test, we know that the period of the front spring is 100 and the rear spring is 90. The weight distribution is about 40 to 60.</p>
<p>There are three support points for the engine department. All are made of soft rubber to absorb vibration. Two points are in the front and form an angle with the horizontal. The remaining one point supports the rear of the power transmission machine. The entire cylinder is water-jacketed. The area around the valve is also water-cooled. This can make the engine more durable and less prone to damage.</p>
<p>The movement of the super eight-cylinder car has been improved a lot. It is the same as when at high speed. This is because the new aluminum intake pipe with four arms has been used. This change can increase the original power of the engine by about 10 horsepower or more. The torque is more than 7 pound-feet. Judging from the carburetor, this new intake pipe requires a larger carburetor. The old-fashioned downward airflow method does not seem very suitable here. Because its control is not as sensitive as usual at low speeds. So the Stex Langley carburetor is used on the Graham car. Two carburetors are used to supply fuel. This can make the car more effective when acting at low speeds.</p>
<p>Other advantages: The super-special eight-cylinder car has an electric automatic brake device. There are also brake drums made of cast iron. The ordinary eight-cylinder and special six-cylinder cars are equipped with Stex Langley carburetors. Eight-cylinder cars use two. The special six-cylinder cars use one. All Graham cars are equipped with Spershi direct shock absorbers. So the car runs very smoothly. These are the characteristics of this year's new car. In short, the two words "cheap and good" are especially the sign of the Graham new car.</p>
