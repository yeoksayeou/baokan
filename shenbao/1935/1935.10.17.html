<p>— 庭</p>
<p>自意阿戰爭爆發以後。海外電訊傳來。各國物價頗呈扶搖直上之勢。舉其著者。如東京銅價於一日之間漲日金三角。而意大利在遠東進行購糧之際。仰光米價及印度股票亦一時飛漲。卽在我國。重要商品之價格。如鋼鐵顏料絲紗米麥雜糧等莫不步步上漲。推原其故。實以世界二次大戰之危機。日趨深烈。意阿爭戰所引起之國際衝突。有使歐洲大陸及其他世界列强捲入漩渦之可能。世界物價一方因軍事上之需要激增。一方因商人之國積居奇。始有此上漲之趨勢也。</p>
<p>夫戰爭危事也。然亦足使少數國家坐獲其利。如第一次世界大戰。美國因而由債務國一躍為債權國。日本因而奠成戰後國力膨脹之基石。其他太平洋沿岸若干國家之社會生產力亦因而以次向上。皆其顯例也。然我中國在上次大戰期間。旣未乘世界物價膨脹之機。擴大其國內社會生產。且遠東形勢。又今昔懸殊。在此大戰危機之週期。恐吾國商人非惟無利可圖。　且將大遭其殃矣。然則我國經濟究宜如何以謀出路乎。竊以為所當努力者。有二端焉。</p>
<p>一曰。我國必須力求工農業生產之進步。方能岡存。夫戰爭之發生。實造因於一二野心國之市塲掠奪。然乘戰爭之機會而促進自國之生產。必强有力之國家始優為之。中國以積弱之餘。欲於大戰爆發之後。步伍他人。享局外之暴利。時至今日。已為勢所不可能。所以然者。蓋國內工農生產。已瀕破產之境。國內市塲。已有因戰爭之故而更受外力挾持之　。然而死中求活。則仍唯有努力生產耳。</p>
<p>二曰。我國必須力求銀價之穩定。目下之世界銀市。美國仍握操縱之大權。世界銀價之高下。對於中國物價。時時發生甚巨之影響。設銀價果能安定。則世界物價之上漲轉足促進中國生產之發展。反之。我國經濟。如長此承受銀價繼續向上變動之打轚。則臨到世界非常動亂之時代。尚復有何出路之可言乎。</p>
<p>戰爭危機下决定今後中國經濟出路之絛件雖非盡在於此然以上兩者固其最要也</p>

<p>意阿開戰以來、國聯對意、已實施經濟制裁遠東與歐洲間航　、遂發生重大變化頗有紀載之價值爰為分誌如下、</p>
<p>荷輪停往意境</p>
<p>荷蘭東亞輪船公司、行駛上海與歐洲班輪、每月開駛一船、其航路自上海而至荷蘭·鹿特丹·Rottordam中途須經過蘇彝士河·經地中海、而到意大利之其內佛·Genoa然後再至德荷、今因意阿戰事發生、行駛地中海商輪、須增保兵險、住　境者取費更巨荷蘭東亞公司，以國聯巳議决對意經濟制裁遠東運意之貨勢必大减、該公司中荷班輪、巳由總行議定、將航路變易、電告滬行、今後由滬返歐之船、概行悴裝赴意貨、並令各輪、不再往意國海口、運赴德荷、該公司已經照辦、</p>
<p>德郵改變輪埠</p>
<p>北德公司新造三特快郵船遠東起點在上海、歐洲第一要港、為　國之其內佛、故該三輪二十三天海程、卽係指上海至其內佛港而言、滬上旅客乘北德特快郵船者、船票多至意國、從其內佛轉火車、再至歐洲各國大陸、詎料意阿風雲不變、遠東航輪已受重大影響、各國郵船、為避免糾紛與危險計、巳相率不往、北德公司亦有電報到滬、將中歐三特快班輪航綫變改、從上海開出後、不再到意境其內佛或納布爾兩埠、改至法國馬賽為第一個港岸、旅客均在法國轉車、本月十九日出口之太里亞號、Tkier與下月十四日出口之香霍斯脫輪等、均不再赴意、直達法國、甚至中歐綫內之各貨輪、亦不往意國矣、</p>
<p>華貨運意大减</p>
<p>現在英法各國商輪、巳經停止運貨到意大利、此舉巳影響到遠東之對歐貿易、我國運意去貨、向以芝麻為大宗、巳停頓多年、至今歲始見起色、方有大批芝麻裝去、詎近來忽因戰關係、巳使我國運意芝麻大减、記者特往調査、知在意阿發生戰事後、芝麻運意、巳經阻停、輸出大减、其他生仁等運意、亦數額無多蓋辦貨者、均皆止辦而停止續運故也、</p>
<p>兵險問題解決</p>
<p>運歐去貨、凡通過地中海與蘇彝士河者、統須加保兵險　運往意國者、則更非加保兵險、輪公司不敢代裝、英法等各保險行、均拒保運意貨、茲本埠巳有美商聯合意商、組織一保險公司、專保運意貨物、業在廣東路設辦事處、巳經開始承保、故運意貨之保兵險問題、巳告解决矣、</p>

<p>— （黃連）</p>
<p>「人貴自立，又貴合羣。」這兩句話誰都知道的。</p>
<p>不過，「自立」與「合羣」，是互相連繫的：缺一不可！</p>
<p>假使祇右「自立」！而不能「合羣」！那麽猶比是「一盤散沙！」</p>
<p>反之，祇有「合羣」！而不能「自立！」那就成爲熙熙攘攘的「一團寄生虫」而已！</p>
<p>因爲必須要個個「自立」！才能增加「合羣！」的堅强性！</p>
<p>猶比十枝箭，枝枝已斷，那麽併在一起，也是無用。十枝箭，一枝未斷。併在一起，那就不容易折斷啦！</p>
<p>人人「合羣！」才能鞏固「自立」的壁壘！譬如一塊鐵，一爈火，當然要被它所熔化。集千百塊鐵在一起，一爈火就無從可以熔化了。</p>
<p>所以希望四萬五千萬的同胞！人人要有「自立」的精神！同時還要有「合羣」的組緞！這就是國家前途的一綫新希望！</p>

<p>— 田舍翁</p>
<p>我的鄰人方老先生，年已花甲，非禮弗視，非禮弗言，一鵝行鴨步的道學先生也。因爲膝下只有愛女二人，都已出嫁。伯道無兒，不但方老先生自己常常憂愁。還時常受了弟婦的譏笑一，心裏更加不快；這便是引起方老先生「租妻」的動機。</p>
<p>有一天的晚上，我記得方老先生，左手執了一支旱烟管，右手拿了一本曆本，鵝行鴨步地來和我的祖母談天。祖母皺着額癟着嘴，笑迷着老眼對方老先生道「聽說鄉下嫂嫂—卽方老先生新租的夫人—可喫紅蛋了。恭喜！恭喜！將來養一個小賓賽，大家酒要多喝幾盃咧。」方老先生笑呵呵地答道：紅蛋是有喫了，養男養女，我却不能保證，阿彌陀佛，這全靠菩薩帮忙吓！說着，把口裏的烟，雲霧似的，噴了出來。我站在祖母膝前想道：這也許是方老先生剛在「念咒」吧。</p>
<p>方老先生把烟斗在地上敲去烟灰，隨把所拿的曆本，翻了幾葉，遞給我祖母瞧。我偷眼瞧去，只見×月××日的上面，打一個紅色小圈，我心中非常納罕。只見方老先生伸出瘦長的指頭，指着紅色小圈道：這天，我到鄉下渾家去住過夜，現在有這小小紅圈兒爲證。算起來，伊已有孕三個月了，祖母道：唔！原來如此。</p>
<p>現在小方先生已經二十一歲了，雖然狀貌舉止，不很像方老先生。我記起這個有趣的故事來，要是有人說懷疑的話，我情願來做證人，不知道這本「結晶之證」的曆本，到如今有否存在？</p>
<h3 id="c163">最近的鹽潮 <a href="#c163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— 憶秋</p>
<p>餘姚二海濱一帶數百里，居留着十萬餘以鹽爲生的鹽民，仗着他們的血汗，氣力，在烈日和鹹水中，掙得一家的衣食，每一斤鹽只能賣二三銅元，生活是十分凄苦而堪憐，最近，鹽厫因存貨堆積，停收額鹽，更使他們處於絕境了。</p>
<p>因着上述的原因，這兩天相公殿一帶的鹽民，起了極大的風潮，許多鹽民包圍着鹽厫，强迫開秤，而厫方又因述年虧累，存貨山積，堅持不允，雙方衝突多次，幾乎閙出亂子，後來經人開導，鹽民們才推出了代表到杭州向鹽述使署去請願，各厫的負責經理，大多不敢住在厫裏，避往他處去了。</p>
<p>至於鹽厫方面存貨山積的原因，是受了精鹽傾鉗的影響，據鹽厫中人說：『江浙的鹽運，都是包稅專營制，譬如某一鹽商，每年包繳稅捐若干萬，得專營某一地的鹽運，從前，鹽厫方面每年總有贏餘，稅金也繳得出，鹽民們也有飯吃，但近年來政府又允許了精鹽的運銷，精鹽產自北方，因收價低廉，所以價格並不高於餘姚粗鹽，民間改食精鹽者日多一日，精鹽的勢力也一天天澎漲起來充斥各地，侵奪了粗鹽的市塲，所以鹽厫方面每年虧蝕，餘姚的鹽民也就岌岌可危了』。</p>
<p>雖然，近來聽說浙江鹽運使已擬就折衷辦法，允許鹽厫照定額六折收鹽，但鹽民們是否答應，鹽厫方面這六折收進的新鹽是否銷得出，還是個問題；就算鹽民答應了，但厫方本已存貨山積，要是再收進新貨仍滯銷不動的話，難保明年不舊調重彈停收—額鹽—我以爲這總不是根本的辦法，兩個人的飯，决不能併給一個人去吃！希望腎明的當局善體斯旨，加以澈底的改革才是，小子大膽，决不敢爲監商辯護，實在是眼看着十餘萬已處絕境的鹽民們心有不忍，知其癥結而不敢緘默而已。</p>

<p>第二十回　掙命看嬌孫抱頭落淚荒年憶往事種麥招殃</p>
<p>老太太也不說話，將那枯蠟似的左手，一把將他摟抱着，眼淚水如拋沙一般滴了下來。月英嗚咽着，朱胡氏扯了他一雙衣袖，也嗚咽着。胡嫂子站在一邊，看了他這三代，那一副凄凉的情形，也不由得心裏痠痛萬分，隨着三人哭了起來。這一下子，將全旅館裏的旅客都驚動了，圍着他們看。及至問起所以然來，雖不便公然的就批評賈多才不對，也都點點頭，歎着那無聲的悶氣。大家圍觀之間，茶房看得這情形圖大了，這就找着胡嫂子道：喂！你是知道我們這裏而情形的，你無緣無故，帶了這麽些個人到這裏來哭，成什麽樣子？賈老爺回了，我吃罪不起。你們快走罷！朱老太擦了眼淚道：我不能走，我走就沒有命了。好容易看着我們孩子一面，我就走開嗎？茶房道：你不走開，還打算賴在我們這過廳裏不成，這可是個來往路頭上。胡嫂子見他們祖孫三代，扭住着一團，若是想猛然的就把他們拆開，有點不容易，便皺了眉道：立刻要他們走，我沒有這樣的力量，賈老爺的屋子，我們不敢胡亂進去，我看就在這裏找個小房間，讓他們坐着談一會子把這一點意思說完了，他們自然也就散開的。茶房淡笑道：你倒說得那樣輕悄，我們開了房間讓他們進去談話，這房　歸那個認？最小的房間，我們還要賣八毛錢一天呢。（三四一）</p>

<p>這幾隻浴盆的外表表雖然是相同的，可是底下都有暗號做着，　以分別它們的用處，萬萬不能弄錯。（如其不小心而弄錯了，太生是决不肯善休的。）——滿盛着溫水，一直抬到太后的足旁才放下。太后便把雙足一起沒人了盆中去，導那四個宮女照着先前的方法，給伊擦肥皂，換手巾，一直到塗抹那耐冬花露。我冷眼從旁看去，不久就發現那四個宮女的手術確是異常的嫻熱而敏捷，伊們知道用多少的氣力才可以把那些浸透了水的毛巾絞到將乾，用多少的肥皂擦在那毛巾上方始適宜，還有用怎樣輕重的手法，才能給太后擦凈污垢而不使伊　得痛楚，以致於怎樣拍法，才容易將那花露拍乾；這種種顯然不是一朝一夕之功所能熟習的，那末伊們當最初所費的一番學習的功夫，不用說是很久的了！我想假使把伊們當做一種具有專門性的藝工看待，也不能算是怎樣過分的抬舉。</p>
<p>下半身擦洗完事之後，太后便立卽將那陲褲穿了起來，而　洗澡的工程，也就跟着宣告圓滿了。可是慢一些，還有一步最後的手續咧！那四個宮女還得另外取起一組（四條）新毛巾來，給太后揩擦手指和面部。自始至終，畢竟換了幾次的新手巾，我已不很記得了，但讓我告訴你們，宮內有十們宮女，整天不做別事，專在那裏給太后擔任漿洗衣服等類的工作，你們就可以知道卽使伊老人家每洗一次操要用四十條的毛巾，也不是什麼不可能的事了！（四三七）</p>

<p>— 楚玉</p>
<p>我們到了夏李，往往要發生了很重的體臭，這體臭依白種黃種男性女性而不同的。但是各人發散的體臭，多以汗爲主，所以也可稱爲汗臭，個人的汗臭，依個人的食物而異其排泄，就是各人的皮膚表面分泌的汗腺，是由各人的肺臟腎臟腸胃等各機關，對於身體的機能，起了排泄作用。氣候炎熱，皮膚的血管膨脹，汗腺分泌尤旺，就是分泌汗腺，把必要以上的體溫，放散到外面，所以我們出了汗以後，就可以調節體溫的。好比身體患病，有寒熱的時候，如服了解熱的藥，那汗腺就會分泌，於是出了一身大汗，那熱就立刻可以退去的。照這樣看起來，汗與衛生，關係實在很大，現在我們要注意下列數點：（一）腐敗的汗，要刺激皮膚，汗出皮膚立叩腐敗，所以發生異臭，汗臭刺激皮膚，非常厲害，小兒們常受汗臭刺激，要减弱皮膚的抵抗力，而目要患濕疹癐毒，那末，出汗以後，應當立即洗滌，不使積留，婦女蓄髮甚長，多秸了汗，容易脫髮。（二）寢時出汗，非常危險，因爲睡熟的人，出了汗後，體溫减低，容易感冒傷風，重則要患肋膜炎，肺尖加答爾，若是精神疲倦，胸部衰弱的人，出了寢汗，那是一種疲勞素毒物，極不相宜，故爲預防出寢汗，可在臨寢時，飲一杯溫牛奶。（三）還有一種腋臭，愈加難受，腋臭多因性慾發育而生，小兒時代，决無腋臭，而且男千腋臭與女子腋臭不同，這是性的雌雄關係而別的。至於身體中體臭最强烈部分，以汗腺密集的部分爲最大，就是腋下，掌，足蹠，鼠蹊，等部。（四）大凡飲食物與汗的影響很大，譬如早飯吃後，食物的成分，即混入汗中，排出皮膚之外，北方人很喜歡吃葱蒜，所以有葱蒜氣，麝香鹿到了思春期，在生殖腺中，分泌了芳香物質。（五）全世界人種中體臭最大的，爲黑種，次爲白種，可是體臭到了年老，也會消減的，因爲年老的人，其機能已經閉塞了。聽說楊貴妃客貌很好，然而伊有兩種大毛病，就是有口臭與腋臭，唐明皇請太醫服以荔枝，口臭漸除，又用香水洗浴，以解腋臭。秘魯王是最喜歡體臭的人，他選后時，令貴婦人們聚集於黑暗的跳舞塲中，等到婦女們舞蹈了半小時，身體出汗的時候，王即鑽到婦女們中，以體臭最烈的，就定爲王后，這種奇癖，眞與嗜痂之癖，無獨有偶啊。</p>

<h3 id="c183">全國木刻聯合展覽會印像記 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>現在大概不會再有人懷疑木刻書在美術上的地位了吧。但在兩三年前，牠正和眼前的小品文一樣，受著大畫家或者大話家們的鄙　，以爲不配進書苑。然而今竟何如？由於幾個靑年藝術家的努力，木刻畫重又拾起頭來，不但進步，而且普遍，有力，成了大衆藝術的先鋒，足以扯毀藝術至上主義者的神聖旗幟，給沈寂的賮壇添一點生氣。</p>
<p>基於這種緣故，我很高興地去參觀了這次全國木刻聯合展覽會。</p>
<p>這個聯合展覽，最初是在北平，其後是天津，濟南，漢口，太原，這回是第六次，在上海。像我這機門外漢，而且又是草草的瀏覽一過，居然也會覺得有興趣，足見那木刻的感人之深了。</p>
<p>展覽會除了現代木刻外，還有古代版畫，民間年畫，木刻用具等的陳列，總計約有七百多件。古代版畫大都是明刊本，也有宋元及金的作品，多數是佛經和民間小說里的挿圖。年　以北平王麻子的爲最多，也最好。</p>
<p>但主要的，當然還得推現代木刻這一部，這一部分里的作品，雖然幼稚，却比較明快，有勁，和現實生活貼切·古代版書旣然不及物深刻，民間年晝也沒有牠生動，這眞是近兩三年來中國畫壇的珍貴的收獲。</p>
<p>這些作品里，有創作，也有世界名作的臨慕。如李樺的怒馬，賴少麒的靑春，就是兩幅很成功的模仿。創作方面，最可注意的是野夫的許多作品，這位作家的成績很平勻，題材的剪取，也彷彿經過相當的考慮，如建築第一聲，馬路如虎口，出喪等。至於水災，大肚鹽（見本刊），悲哀等幾幅，雖然是從連續　里描出來的，但那刻劃的精妙，畫意的有力，手法的熟鍊，在在都說明他是一個很有希望的木刻作家。</p>
<p>羅清禎的早期作品，頗能兼有野夫的長處，然而他現在好像是在改變作風了。由大刀關斧，一變而爲細針密縷，這在力的一方面，好像要差一點。然而他的那幅牛和放牧歸來，却還是不可多得的。</p>
<p>此外如張望的丐，　　的一樣的面孔，陳葆眞的力，段幹靑的兩只手，戴隱郞的瞠目，　濤的討債，沃　的田中餐，王興拴的討乞，張慧的農忙和前進是光明的，都很剛健，而且有意思，不失爲上好的作品。</p>
<p>通觀這次的木刻，頂成功的，我以爲是人物的臉部表情，差不多每一個作家都很注意到這一點。瞠目，一樣的面孔等且不說吧，便是幾幅人像，如段幹靑的甘地肯像，楊塡的巴比塞像，鄧靑的肖像等，這些大概是從照相里揭取下來的吧，然而都很能够逼眞，傳神。</p>
<p>更其難得的，是野夫的兩幅磚書，這是一種新的嘗試，磚刻比木刻更經濟，就眼前這一點成績看來，那前途的違大，光明，是可以預料的。</p>
<p>最後要提到連續畫了，倘使我的記憶不錯，那末，這次展覽會里好像只有一幅許崙音的日出之前，是完全的連續畫，那是寫一個小學教師的遭遇的。許先生和金緊野先生，是全國木刻聯合展鑒會的最先發起人，現在金先生帶了這些作品到上海人的眼前，可是許先生却於幾星期前，悄悄地離開這一個世界了。我實在爲他悼惜。</p>
<p>中國的木刻畫，雖然發源最早，然而一向被人輕視，壓抑，幾乎衰微得看不見了，現在要拿這一點點成績，去和比，德，法，英，蘇聯等國相比較，當然是幼稚得很的。因爲我們的確還沒有麥綏萊勒（FransMasereel）·米非爾特（Meffert，伯蘭頓（ConatantLeBreton），南桑（Pamela'dA．Nalhan），畢斯凱來夫（N．I．Piskarev）和珂那舍維支（V．Konashevich）。然而我們却已經有了努力，有了由這努力而開出來的花朶，我們期待他鮮艷，美麗，茂盛。</p>
<p>這是我看了全國木刻聯合展覽會後的一偭希望。</p>
<h3 id="c184">某夜（上） <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— 西村</p>
<p>正像黑暗和光明是兩種相反的對比一樣，黑夜和白天也是一樣的全然不同。在黑夜，你，不能像在白天似地看得見晴朗的天空，和飛翔着的各式各樣的白雲；擺在你面前的只是昏黑的天慕和稀疏的星子；在夜里，也不能如白天般呌你看淸楚遠方的前路，目力所及的範圍只是很有限的一片片的晤影，路燈更會把黑夜額外托出一副暗淡的影像來。白天里的繫閙情形，到夜里是完全變成冷靜的了，是的，黑夜的馬路上處處都給你伸出淸幽的寂靜。</p>
<p>那時候我因爲職務上的關係，每天夜里必要在一條長蛇般的馬路上走一躺的。時候總在午夜時分。那時的街上眞是淸靜極了，一個人都沒有，只有忽閃忽現的影子和沉重的脚步聲來緊陪着我的寂寞。還有時，由於偶然刮起一陣風，就會從頭上飛下一兩片落葉，悄悄的，就滑到馬路上不響一聲了。說起來秋天的馬路上一向是不缺少落葉的。</p>
<p>一個人在寂靜的馬路上走着，這是很有一種說不出的意味的，那時的聽覺最爲敏捷，遠方有一種極小的聲音，像落棄掃地的聲昔，和市招飄動的聲晋都能够聽得很淸晰的，若是汽車的喇叭聲和工廠馬逹聲響，不消說聽得來更是一淸二白的了。</p>
<p>那一天晚上，在同一時間，照例的我又在馬路上走起來，預備回到鴿子窩一般的屋子里去歇夜，當我走不到一半的路程時，我似乎聽到近處有人在喊着，先還聽不出喊出的字句，過後讓我聽淸了。</p>
<p>「賣孩子——誰——要買——孩子？」</p>
<p>聲音拉得長長的，很顯然的讓我猜到了一定是呼喊的人沒有加足了氣力，而從那微弱的聲音中，又很可以猜測到這中間似乎是存有某種難堪的隱痛在着。</p>
<p>我想起來一回事情。前些天，不是每天都讓我從報紙上看見一些驚人的消息麽，那些消息全是用大號字標題登在報紙的第一版的，水，水呀，那是說水災呀，從南到北，從東到西，全個國士之內差不多全佈滿了水息了。而當我每次看到那些連續刊載的水災通信時，更常常要引起一種感傷，悲慟的情調。那時我一方面爲災民悲，一方面也就很自然的想到河務工程的不被重視那件事情上。報紙上還說到上海這里已有好些災民來了，聽說地方當局爲的怕發生意外，多生事端，正在設法遺散遠去，可是遠去到什麽地方去呢，我當時想，不是處處都有水麽。</p>
<p>因此，讓我聯想到莫不是災民在呌苦呀！他們沒有家，留他們的身子在馬路上過夜自然是很可能的；他們沒有錢，然而他們却不能不吃飯，只有賣孩子求解脫了，這不但可以呌他們多吃幾頓飯，不是也减輕了負擔麽。可是，孩子究竟是他們的血肉，所以還是有些捨不得，連累得他們的喉嚨喊起來也不大痛快了；他們固然希望能够給孩子找個售主，但是，他們又何嘗不在希翼孩子能够賣不出去才好呢！</p>
<p>「賣孩子——誰——要買——孩子？」</p>
<p>第二次喊聲又呌出來了，我在這時恰好走到了他們的面前。在一座洋房的山牆外，一個還能避風的處所，那里躺着三個人。街燈的光亮還能够映出他們三具灰土土的臉。男人和女人是中年人，大約是夫妻，孩子掛着滿臉鼻涕，約有四五歲，自然該是他們的孩子了。他們身上穿的全是些破爛連檻褸還不如的衣服，夜寒難以抵禦，全在打着冷戰。他們擠在一塊取暖。一點也沒有猜錯，他們正是難民。男的向我撇出一副意外而又帶有乞憐的無光眼色，在我的身上溜了一轉，然後開口了：</p>
<p>「先生，作作好事罷，把孩子買了去好不好？」</p>
<p>我呆站着，沒有出聲，我不知道該回答什麼話語好。他們眞是三個人麽？比三具髏骨差不多呢。他們這種前程無路坐以待斃的樣子，又有些像被牽入宰作里的牛和猜。他們的生死是操在別人手里的。女的趁我不出聲時響着沙啞的嗓子搭上話：</p>
<p>「先生，沒有法子，家里的水，唉，水淹了。屋子，田地，都淹完了。沒有法子。先生，行行好事罷，把孩子買去罷。」</p>
<h3 id="c185">憶房總的夏 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 香山</p>
<p>夏，海面透過來爛熟的菓味的素風，滲着海藻的鮮味，是多麽　洋洋的氣息呀！</p>
<p>棉似的雲，疊堆在憂　的天空裏，灰色的海鷗，沿　海岸，在雲際裏　　着弧綫和罔形，這悠悠然的翱翔的飛舞，讓倦於旅的傷愁的人，景仰並引領。</p>
<p>讓房總半島和三浦半島挾着的東京灣，平坦地展在天幕的下面，釀造無數的想像和冥想的種子；而那一片無涯的在半島頂點下的太平洋，蕩蕩然的眞不知看過了幾百萬年的宇宙的歷史，毫無所感地，一波一波地頻擊着元立於靑空中的燈塔的周團。</p>
<p>移到房總半島的北條以來，將倦於世俗的眼，移眺蒼然的大海和蜿蜒在半島上的靑山；當海嘯經過海岸的靑蒼的坊波柏林以後，就輕盈地爬過畝然的稻田，襲進叢叢的山岡，發出洞徹天地的瀏亮而驚人的聲音。這時，停在山坡的神社屋脊上的麻雀，就點點亂舞，像天空撒播着芝麻的種子；而那啾啾的騷音，和着刮破了半面的神社的大幟的　　聲，就驚破了在屋簷下畫陲的看社人的好夢。</p>
<p>呵，海是雄渾而淡泊的呵！憑着這無止境的大海，而溯憶起自己的整天價的瑣碎的生涯，實能感到渺小而可恥恥</p>
<p>朝上，村道還沒有跫然足音的時候，推開窗戶，在八尺見方的小院裏徘徊起來，清冽的露珠，沾染了和服的長袖。這露珠是像淚一般的晶瑩，宛如別離之夢剛醒時，滿枕滿袖所沾染的一般。</p>
<p>在蔓着牽牛花的井裏，汲起澈　的冷水洗臉時，不　然　吟起賀茂的千代女的俳　　：</p>
<p>「蔓延於吊桶上　牽牛呵！為你，從鄰家討來了井水。」</p>
<p>從這首俳句裏，能感到女人的一種多麽柔和的性情來，為着不忍把夜夾蔓在吊桶上的牽牛摘斷，因此無法打水，紙好從鄰家討要井水，這種對於生物的愛，眞是我所渴望的呀！然而這紙是種過去的存在吧！</p>
<p>等到白日散滿金光在宇宙之時，登上西濱的城山，向下眺望，則　白色的砂灘，靜　地仟海水冲擊，河童們所穿的各色的海浴衣，像紅綠黃等色的田圃的野花，點綴在海灘上，而那放置在岩石上的海水草帽，宛如忘了隨漸退去的火具，懶洋洋地蟄伏着，這裏，那裏，紛樹着像雨後毒　般的遮日傘。這時，遠處有二三十個漁夫漁婦，在曳拉魚網，從網上掉下來的水珠，映着日光，五色般的燦然炫眼。有一種俚歌的合唱聲，節奏地歌着，海中，一帆船，滿孕海風，負着一船的陽光，蹴碎金波，疾馳而逝，去了。</p>
<p>看着這種海的景緻，使我憶起英國美貌女作家，K．ManSrield的灣頭小景（Atthebay）來，這海灣雖不是蛾眉月灣（CrescentBay），然而她的細膩的文緻，不也帖合着道下面的館山灣嗎？</p>
<p>正當深沈於思索之中，山鳥的聲音陡地在倚靠着的松樹梢上，呌了起來。</p>
<p>呵！海是充滿了愉快和亭樂，使人忘記了一切苦難的生涯，像夢　利似地沈於忘　的境界裹。——當憑几半睡時。海村的鷄啼着悠長的報午聲音時，海村的老年人在葡萄架下　着千鈞重的眼皮時。</p>
<p>這時。祇有燦燦的陽光，並樹叢間知了的聲音像油剪似地滿澈於天地之間，而我從這煩雜的聲音裏，能感到現實的煩惱，同時能悟到寂然的境界；難道靈魂常是跟隨着這煩雜的現實在折磨着的嗎？　或是寂然地這　了呢？這時，一片夏雲。掩過銀杏樹，嫋嫋的百合花瓣上，現出來愁容和蔭影。雖然百合花是樓植在八角金盤的大葉下，但懼於將到來的夏雨的威脅，是一樣地感到戰　和失神吧！</p>
<p>我煩惱，我感到空息的恐怖，凉風從海面透了過來，並帶來了海灘上的年靑人的笑聲和歌曲，但我卻覺我的心更被煽動起來；待掛在簷下的風鈴，響起清冽的聲音時，拾頭望天，一羽海鷗，翱然越空而過，眼裏留下了自在的姿影。這時，遠山近岡，茂鬱像被蒸爆一般，而再環視小院中靜寂的狀態，和自己憑几而臥的安靜，感到一種難言的滋味。</p>
<p>『臥趙着，閑眺悠悠之浮雲，在夏的居室。』</p>
<p>這句志田野坡的徘句，是述着在安暢的滿着綠蔭的居室裏，眺望自在的淨雲之騷人的行爲。這是多麽超然的境界呀！唉！讓眼閉起來吧！沈睡在漠漢不知的夢裏，儘令潺潺的汐見川的流聲，在旅人的枕旁瀉</p>
<p>待醒來時，黑幕從海的對方掩了過來，羣山蒼蒼欲暮，水際漫起烟靄，迷濛難辯。，遠處的鄉土舞踴的大鼓之聲盈耳，海村的小戲院也奏起招徠客人的樂音，當抬頭望屋的西隅時，在望火臺的頂上，掛了塊血紅的晚霞。</p>
<p>黑夜到來了，海的潮氣侵骨，房東的孩子，用屬拍着小手，又指點着墨黑的天空，緩緩地唱着童謠：</p>
<p>一個星兒瞧見了，</p>
<p>在雲兒傍喲！</p>
<p>二個星兒瞧見了，</p>
<p>在……</p>

<p>— 江馬修作任鈞譯</p>
<p>在我的家裏，大家也集攏來，把老婆婆安慰了一番。除了說這雖然毫無疑義是件悲哀的事情，但實際上也是件很有名譽的事情之外，也就別無安慰的方法。特別是母親，她還談起了東京的靖國神社的事情；她懇懇切切地告訴她聽：戰死者都在那兒被祭祀，每年要大祭兩回，並且無論怎樣高貴的人們都要到那兒去參拜。</p>
<p>在母親說着話的當兒，老婆婆比較要來得平靜些了。並且，全然好像是聽着稀有的說教一般地，一壁不斷地流着眼淚，一壁對於每一句話都深深地表示首肯，像是很滿足似地聽着。</p>
<p>「從你的話聽來，」她抽着鼻涕說：「眞令人覺得十分不敢當。如今，我已經眞正地懂得名譽這回事了。謝謝你。眞正是名譽，名譽！我要快些回去好好地告訴我的丈夫聽。雖然如此，可是……那勇造……」</p>
<p>說起勇造，她又哇的一聲地哭倒了。母親更用各種話語去勸解她，然後叫掌櫃的陪着她，把牠送到家裏去。</p>
<p>依據後來更詳細的報告，勇造乃是死於那可怕的二零三高地的攻擊戰。他從來就常常以男敢和大胆使人驚嘆。那一天，他也在彈雨當中站在突擊隊的前頭邁進。當他倒下去的時候，全身實在已經中了二十三個子彈。而且，人家將他搬到帳篷裏之後，他還生存了十個鍊頭的時間。</p>
<p>他馬上被昇爲伍長，由於超羣的　績，還得到了功六級的金鷄勳章。功六級的伍長，這實在是件破格的事情。前例是極少的。並且還發下了一筆三百兩的慰勞金。</p>
<p>燒飯老婆婆非常得意而且與高得了不得。</p>
<p>「怎麽樣，功六級嘿！是僩伍長啦。就是鎭長老爺也趕不上我的兒子呢。恭喜，恭喜，那裏還有比這更有名譽更值得高興的事情呢！」</p>
<p>然後，她就跑到我的母親跟前，這麽說：</p>
<p>「喏，太太！可以領到三百塊錢，我簡直完全跟做夢一樣呢。請你想想吧，三百兩，這筆錢可不算少啦。我們從有生以來也沒有見過那麽一筆大欵子，想起來，連頸也會發暈呢。雖然如此，可是我已經幾成了有錢人哪！」</p>
<p>「眞是一件好事。」母親回答她：「那是因爲你有着能幹的兒子呀。沒有看見嗎，鎭上的人都在欣羨着你呢。他們都在說：「這不光是你個人的名譽，同時也是鎭上大家的名譽」。』</p>
<p>老婆婆高興得哭泣起來，眼淚汪汪地。</p>
<p>『想起來，我的兒子眞可憐；可是，覺得也實在死得好。人雖然死了，靈魂却還在；在東京的靖國神社裏給人們祭記着，也不會有什麽不滿足。古語說得好：『人生僅一世，而流芳則千古」。』</p>
<p>『當然。話雖如此：但是，政府也實在很到，很值得感謝呀。』</p>

<p>國貨在今日，總算奮　得有些成效了，除了一般迷信洋貨，存心不肯愛國的以外，不要說中國人歡喜中國貨，中國人服用中國貨，量近許多外國人，也很重視中國貨，很歡喜服用中國貨。前日扶輪會席上，美國商務參贊安諾德氏演講：『如何促進中國國外貿易』他說：中國若要促進國外貿易的話，開宗明義的第一要圖，是要人人有自信力，還要集中人人的心思才力，然後中國貨纔有出路。數個月前，有幾個美國經濟考察團游歷廣州，在商會會議席上，有某曾員請求美國人多用華茶，但數小時前，當地銀行界假某大華人所設的飯店宴請該團圑員時，所用的茶，不是中國茶葉，乃是道地的舶來品。並且還和入牛乳，殊失中國人品茶不主攙和其他物品，以免亂味的傳統習慣。原來中國商人，或其他各界接待外賓時，甚或於本國人互相酬酢中，每喜採用外茶，並不算爲奇事的。有時竟在中國政府自辦的火車中以及大旅館大酒樓中，要嘗華茶也不能到口。所以經濟團員，曾向中國主人進言：最好請中國人自己先用華茶，使華茶在中國得先普遍，然後再來勸人，以此類推，可知要擴張國際貿易，須得從本國做起。安氏這一番話，很有深意。記者聽了十分地慚愧不置。近來國際貿易局時常有接到外國公司採用國產的委託，有的願爲中國貨作忠實的宣傳或販賣，有的願爲中國貨，作義務的陳列或展覽。尤其是值得欣幸而光榮的，上海南京路的上海電力公司，沿路櫉窗裏，完全陳列着亞浦耳出品的電燈泡，並且還盛稱其光亮省電，這不由地使人有些奇怪，上海電力公司，大家都知道他是洋商的，向來聽說非舶來品是不願意陳列。亞浦耳燈泡，是中國貨，洋商方面，爲什麼倒用起中國貨來呢？因爲洋商們很有眼力，認爲這種貨品，值得採用一下，並不是說了洋商一提倡，便認爲我們的國貨聲價十倍。須知經營任何事業，只要能脚踏實地做去，一旦有了成績，自然可以引起人們的信仰和贊美，不過先得自己有自信力量，遲早總可使人家十分滿意。亞浦耳廠，不過是一個例子罷了。</p>

<p>「八百英雌齊拍手，居然奪得錦標歸。」這次全國運動大會各項運動以女選手最爲出色，最有精彩。各國貨工廠以女選手爲國民之母，今筱民族之强盛，擊於女同胞者甚大，爲鼓勵女同胞注意體育起見，因有歡連之　。記者認爲女選手之任務，不僅從事運動，注意體育已也，諸女選手，均爲各地優秀之分子，均屬各地學生界之領袖，苟能以服用國貨爲各地倡率，更矢志爲國貨界作有力之宣傳，抱定非國貨不用之素志，爲　淡岑寂之學生　貨年，作暮鼓之叩，以關國貨界之新生路。則諸君之爭光於體育界旣大，復造福於國貨界者更多。記者更誦一言，以贈諸君。</p>

<h3 id="c191">全運會與國貨 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 肖白</p>
<p>在雙十節那天，第六屆全國運動大會，於十餘萬觀衆熱烈的情緒中，正式開寡了。我們在那天看到這樣偉大的空前的大會盛況，自然雖也覺得中國前途是十分有望，民族復興，國家富强，都在我們掌握之中，現在，該會從開幕到今天，很快的又是七天，我們除了慶祝他們成績格外成功外，却又要提出一些關於民族經濟繁榮，整個產業前途的希望者，敬獻於大會全體運動員和數十萬的觀衆們。</p>
<p>我很深切地覺得，這次全運會的舉行，和國貨運動的進行，很有着相當的關係，大家曉得，今年是學生國貨年，是以學生爲主體，大家共同前進的一個國貨年頭，而在這次全運會中，也是以各地學生爲中堅的，所以我想他們倘能發揮些提倡國貨的效能，大家肯稍盡力一點，那末，它對國貨前途的收效，一定不小，現在，我敢寫出我對於全運會，具着的兩個熱烈希望。</p>
<p>第一，大會中運動員和觀衆都應努力服用國貨：在會塲四周，據我參觀所得，果也可以看到幾家國貨工廠的臨時商塲，但是專販洋貨的商店，却也不少，尤其是對於飲食品，我竟看到有不少舶來的汽水，啤酒，麵包，大菜等，使我覺得，因了這樣一個光榮的大會，而却替洋貨做大量的推銷，這實是大大的錯誤，所以，我很熱烈的希望全體的大會觀衆和運動員，你們對於在會塲內的一切消費，都應極力服用國貨，以盡自己做國民的天責。</p>
<p>第二，國貨界應有圑結在該會實施官傳的必要：這一次大會的觀衆，當然十分熱鬧和擁擠，通常每日人數總在十萬左右，該會舉行十天，總人數恐要在數十萬人以上，在這樣一個龐大的盛會中，我覺得國貨界實很有集團宣傳的必要，以我的見解，最好能由許多國貨工廠，公司等聯合印成若千介紹國貨的小冊子或傳單等，向大會觀衆散發，這一定是一個很有意義和價值的工作。</p>
<p>其他，如國貨界招待大會選手，和會塲四周應有國貨標語，挿岡的佈置等，也是很念需的，總之，國貨運動是和體育運動一樣都是眼前我們救急存亡的迫切問題，需要大家加以努力而促其成功。</p>
<h3 id="c192">敬告國貨廠商 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>在此提倡國貨聲中，國貨工廠像雨後春筍般的興起來，這也是一個極好的現象。不過各工廠總感覺到已方勢力薄弱，不能和外人競勝；而又貨品不能暢銷，隨時有「後難爲繼」之嘆。於是有的說是世界不景氣，以致是這樣；也有的說是木國人太不愛國，不肯購用國貨。這兩點也許是有些關係，但不能便認爲國貨不能暢銷的最大癥結。我以爲「物必自腐，而後蟲生。」貨物的不能銷行，國人的不加愛護，自己本身一定也有可議之點在。否則人非叔實，何至認賊作父呢！吾以爲目下國貨工廠最大最重的兩點毛病，便在「經濟不健全」和組織不健全，」因此便有許多缺點，隨之發生。現在菩把這兩點分論於後：</p>
<p>怎叫做經濟不健全呢？這一點很容易明白的，譬如一個工廠，欲組織健全，最低限度須十萬元，發起人和贊成人倒拿不出這許多本錢來；而中國人投資於工業，又是不大情願的，所以招股也不大容易：那末不得不向親友們東拚西凑，一萬元也好，二萬元也好，便把工廠開起來。各種設備，當然因陋就簡；貨物因之也不能加以改進。倘沒風浪打擊，也可將就過去；一遇外商加以競爭，便有朝不保夕的危險。這是經濟的不健全，也便是我們國貨廠商的第一大缺點。</p>
<p>怎叫做組織不健全呢？這便從經濟不健全而來的。一個工廠，因了資本不充裕，不能請得優秀的人才來處理一切，那末組織上自然會呈現著紊亂和不合科學化。而且還爲了資本的關係，這一個大股東介紹一個技師？又一個大股東介紹一個帳房，實在是爲了面子關係，不得不讓他們濫竽充數，這還會有好的成績嗎？所以一個組織不健全的工廠，也會使生產力落後，財產力消耗，這便是我們國貨工廠的第二缺點。</p>
<p>希望熱心國貨的廠商們，一方面向前努力；一方也要把這兩點缺點革除才是。</p>
<h3 id="c193">從全運會想到健兒們的足下 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>

<p>「昔晋文以追念從亡有功的介之推，故國復興，而之推已抱木死！文公穿木展以紀念之，時常悲呼足下，」這一段故事，值得我們變通和取法的，在這民窮財盡的今日中國，健兒們旣是復與民族的動力，足下的運動鞋，以及平常服用的衣履，非國貨不穿牠，是毫無猶豫的，陳嘉庚公司，雖不幸給予我們的痛心史！但正泰廠，廣東兄弟廠的回力球鞋，大中華橡膠廠的跑鞋，和許多橡膠廠的出品，還有供吾人極滿意的選擇啊。</p>

<p>— 潘逸民</p>
<p>—值得介紹之有希望新工業—</p>
<p>王樹衡君，係寳山王詠仁先生之公子，今夏畢業於滬江大學工業化學系，王君平時對於科學，悉心研究，頗具心得，最近由豆餅及豆渣中提取可代舶來品—乾牛酪—之工業原料！植物性酪素，試騐已獲成功，王君示以所製之豆酪樣品及應用該酪素製成之三夾板，成績非常優美，據王君云；此三夾板惟用以證明豆酪素確可代替舶來品乾牛酪而已，酪素在其他工業上之應用，不知凡幾，如一各種膠黏物質，特別如色，鑲，塗，蓋之用，二，人造之堅硬鑲料如電木及人造角質物等，三，照相軟片，四，化裝品五，肥皂六，紙七，人造絲八，人造皮九，壁紙十，油漆十一，藥品十二，食品十三，隔竄器十四，皮鞋油十五，按糜十六，礦油凝結劑十七，防水布十八，除虫粉十九，印染業二十，精練酒類，在近三十年來，酪素工業在歐美各國，突飛猛進，其製取事業之地位，亦日見重要，牛乳產量不足之國家，必須向國外輸入酪素，例如德國年由美法運入大量之酪素，每年之消耗量約在一五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇磅左右，美國在一九一八年，僅製八·〇〇〇·〇〇〇磅，在一九二七年，增至一八·〇〇〇·〇〇〇磅至一九二八年後，年由國外輸入二八·〇〇〇·〇〇〇磅之鉅，再就阿根廷一地而言，一九三二年，酪素之輸出，爲一九三〇噸，至一九三三年，增至四四二四噸，其他如新西蘭，比利時等諸國，又何嘗不年年增加，王君鑒於酪素之消耗量，殊足驚人，而又感於牛乳中之合量，若是之小，似大有尋求新泉源供給之必要，因思及酪素係一種蛋白質，而我國聞名於全世界之主要出品—大豆—豈非可供給此原料之理想物品，旋卽着手提取，結果確能提出，但王君感於以豆爲原料，較牛乳雖已便宜，但成本仍覺尚高，且豆油當先行提凈，手續麻煩，不若由豆餅及豆渣中設法提取，則成本旣低，而手績亦簡，因即繼續研究，經多次精確之試騐，最近竟獲成功，從此我國可不再仰給外貨，以杜塞一鉅大漏扈，植物性酪素實爲我國有希望新工業之一，記者咸於欲振興實業，須從我國固有之特物上着想，庶幾可收事半功倍之效，以我國今日大豆之重要地位而言，此項工業實有使其發展之必要，且最足使記者愜意者，卽原料爲我國特產，固不待言，而應用之藥品，均爲我國之自製品，自始至終，不用絲毫外貨，此亦爲國貨工業中所難能者也，苟我國實業界志士，能奮然以興，共起而與王君合作，則數年之後，何患不能與外貨抗衡，駕而上之也。</p>

<p>提倡國貨的聲浪，喊得震天價響，但一部分的人，在口頭不妨儘是高喊口號，而其實際對於衣食服用一切，你若是去細心的檢査一下，恐怕大多數都是舶來品，他何以要如此言行不符，口是心非呢？他是在愛學時髦嗎？不—在我和鄰居的閒談中，也可以推想到一般人的心理了。鄰人說：「現在的國貨種類固然多得很，但是有些物品，質地太粗劣！而且不耐久用！也有價目比洋貨還貴！那得不令人見而生憎！不得不購用洋貨了」。原來一部分的人，購用洋貨，是爲了國貨的粗劣，價貴，不耐久用，是的，在國貨中具有這幾種情形的，當然有的，是無庸諱言的。</p>
<p>不過：你應該知道，物力維艱！一件物品的製成，要化去幾許的時間，經濟，和手續，精力的，請看那物質文明的歐美，研究製造一件機械，很有本人盡畢生心力，不能造就，便由他的兒子繼續研究下去，倘　兒子一坐，還不能造成的話，便又遺傳孫子，再繼續刻苦研求！必須要使他的工作，全部完成爲止，這並非作者的胡說，凡能明瞭世界情形的人，也許都知道的。如此看來，凡物創造，必非短時間，所能够達於雜善盡美之境！在幾種新創的國貨請你們不應該加以深責！嫌它粗劣和不耐用。至於貨價的貴，亦因創造之始。採用高價的原料，以求出品的精美，所以售價也不得不提高一些了。總之；在工商凋敞經濟恐慌達於極點的我國現代，除全民衆服用國貨，以挽救危亡外，別無他策！若論自製品低劣等等，也祇好『看在國貨面上』，樂於購用才是。</p>

<p>— 陳遵源</p>
<p>本刊仰葊先生歌頌新近之兩大發明，一是向次濤湯仲明二君的木炭汽車，一件是鍾靈君的中國植物油燈，的確，這實在是國貨界值得歌頌的事，但木炭汽車早已有許多人知道，試用的也很多，讚美者幾遍滿全國，用不到我來多說話，惟是植　油燈爲新近才發明，國人知道的還寥寥無幾，仰葊先生也不過歌頌其犖犖的大優點，現在，我再把植物油燈詳細的告訴國人，這是我愛護國貨的良心所驅使，並非有意要替鍾君做僞宣傳。</p>
<p>大家都知道的，目前我國經濟的危機，已將到了不可收拾的地步，所以年來時常有人高唱塞止漏卮，復與農村，政府也從這些努力，實在的，要挽救經濟危機，惟有减少久超和救濟農村，査我國每年入超有五萬萬元，煤油一項，就有一萬萬元，幾佔全數五分之一，這麼巨大的漏卮，的確令人　嘆，然煤油的消耗，則完全用在燃燈火方面，夫以我國內地民衆日日所必需的煤油，日日仰給於外國，一旦國際戰爭爆發，洋商壟斷居奇，這是必然的，倘若因爲戰爭而封銷，來源斷絕，則萬家燈火，將告熄減，這又是一件多麽可驚的事呢？鍾君眼光遠大，乃從事研究，經四年的苦心，遂發明中國植物油燈，利用天然或人爲的壓力將械物油不斷的壓到燈頭，燈就可以燃點了，燃燈的植物油包括好多種，荳油，菜油，花生油，棉子油，生物油和一切的草子油等大可以利用代替煤油，因爲這些種物油完全是中國最富的產品，就地取利，而就不用向外國供求，這麽一來，我們每年可减少了利權外溢年約一萬萬元了，同時農村增加生產也就一萬萬元，可减少失業人數約數百萬人，這當然值得提倡，至燈的式樣也很多，檯燈，掛燈，風雨燈（卽桅燈），大的小的，簡單的，華麗的都有，且已得到政府的專利了，該公司發起人丁廷標先生等現在已集了好多資本，預備設廠，雙十節的時候就可出貨，前天邀我到該公司的籌備處參觀各式的燈樣，我才相信他們所說的（一）價廉（二）安全（三）衛生（四）省油（五）光亮都是眞的，我才佩服他們眼光的精明，回家後，思念不忘，願國人注意之，更盼望施行復興農村的領袖們格外注意。</p>

<p>各項泳式以仰泳爲最難、故參加女子百公尺仰泳者寥寥無幾、僅分兩組舉行、每組取四名、粵梁詠嫻下水後、即出人頭地、以一分四十秒七破楊秀瓊保持之一分四十五秒二全國紀錄、桂龐永芳亦非弱者、努力追趕、終點僅差四尺餘、可謂難能、秀珍近習仰泳、頗具功夫、昨列第三、第二組美人魚楊秀瓊畢竟非凡、餘子遠非其敵、下水後二十公尺處、即分先後、果然一路領先、終點距最後京選手李和珍達三十餘公尺、成績一分四十三秒、破其本人保持之全國紀錄、惟較梁詠嫻尚差三秒許、决賽時當有一番劇烈爭鬥、</p>
<p>陳振興平全國紀錄</p>
<p>男五十公尺自由式複賽、第一組陳振興果然壓倒陳其松而獲首席、成績平全國、閩潘威廉於最後衝刺先滬梁偉生而列第三、第一組菲陳懷望、確具功夫、雖不敵港之李羅敏及馬華之陳鴻成、但已壓倒粵之王秀山、李羅敏昨日出發頗佳、衝刺亦好、此項决賽時、滬梁偉生倘能發搏其最佳功夫、或有獲取亞軍希望、</p>
<p>人魚複賽再創遠新</p>
<p>女子五十公尺自由複賽、兩組結果、盡成港粵天下、馬滬閩桂盡被淘汰、最可惜者滬劉索嫺於預賽時以卅七秒六、造在全國新紀錄、但於複賽中竟被薩惠英淘汰薩於預賽時、成績在四十二秒以上、複賽中猛晉殊速、楊秀瓊果然不負衆望、於第一組複賽中、再以卅六秒破遠東及全國紀錄、實屬難能、粵劉桂珍於第二組獲首席、陳玉輝力掙得第四、</p>
<p>俯泳複賽蛙王稱雄</p>
<p>男二百公尺　泳複賽上塲、蛙王小郭、大刀闊斧、一路先導、劉琨王耀民、努力奮爭、壓倒馬華何士東列二三席、第二組劉美修確具功夫、安坐首席、惟陳福星仍失敗於菲島黃兩宜、黃出發並不佳、但中途速度甚快、倘能於起點下功夫、亦上駟材也、桂軍劉琨、於第一組中、力追蛙王、姿勢美妙、雖敗猶榮、</p>
<p>李羅敏壓倒陳其松</p>
<p>最後節目男子百公尺自由泳、爲最富興趣之一項、計分六組、每組取三名、馬華吳文鑑、壓倒曾阿福佔第一組首席、標王軍梁顯明、實力雄厚、粵王秀山力爭失敗、梁安然得第二組首席、經三組梁偉生、一分十秒八、尙未發揮其全力、第四組粵之吳年勝桂軍黃景煥約半尺、第五組陳振興仍領先導、終點閩潘威廉僅落後二尺、陳成績一分七秒八、第六組李羅敏功夫老到、終點竟以一身之差、壓倒保持全國佳者、閩潘威廉、確具實力、倘能努力爲之、决賽中頗有希望也、</p>

<p>王季淮屈居第三</p>
<p>五項運動、昨日殊少精彩、因郝　德無資格參加、陳賽球又自動棄權、王季淮成績退步、故競賽情形、異常鬆懈、參加比賽者共十五人、彭永馨、畢慶華、董翰文、田景堯四人、中途退出、堅持到義者共有十一人、結果山西之紀茂德、以二六〇三分獲得冠軍、紀爲去年華北第一、廣東之黃英傑、努力掙扎、躍居第二席、黃昨於賽中、特別努力、於最最後一次、千五百米終塲時、竟暈倒、紀茂德之勝利、得力於最後之一千五百米、在此一項中、共得八百餘分、而其他各項成績、亦極平均可觀、按此次係採用新式計分法、約合舊計分法二千九百餘分、茲將全部成績誌下、</p>

<p>遼隊始終居前　滬隊苦追不及</p>
<p>昨日之千六百公尺接力、因出席者只有九單位、故將預賽改爲决賽、計參加者爲馬華·北平·上海·湖北·湖南·南京·廣東·遼寗·靑島九隊、就中實力最强者、爲上海遼寗兩隊、上海隊由姚戴寗跑第一棒、李培德跑第二棒、重淑昭跑第三棒、戴淑因跑第四棒、遼寗隊由金長顯跑第一棒、吳景耀跑第二棒、李世銘跑第三棒、劉長春跑第四棒、起步時、于震江即居首位、廣東之梁韻明居第一位、上海之姚戴寗居第三位、至第二更不易追上、至第三棒、上海爲董叔昭、遼寗李世銘、李佔先十米、董在後苦追、先超過廣東、但終不能追上遼寗、至第四捧、劉長春出一發最快、戴淑國在後苦逐、至千五百米處、戴已氣竭力盡、速度頓减劉則健步如飛、一路直衝終點、成績三分四十秒、惜未能打破全國紀錄、全部成績如下、</p>

<p>十項前半部、昨已賽完、張齡佳以二九零一分佔首席、昨日賽完前半部者、共有十五人、預料名次、今日尚有升降、故須待後半部結東後、始能决定正式分數、昨日除張得二九零一分外、遼之周長星、與滬之葉嵩平各得二八零零分、周爲去年華北運動會十項冠軍、後半部成績較優、昨雖與葉並列第二、但今日或有超出張齡佳之可能、故冠軍亞軍、將爲周張兩人爭之、北平之王士林、福建之吳景祺、遼寗之夏樹福、廣東之梁植初均有入選前六名之希望、</p>

<p>前湖北總領隊劉昌合、抗議王郝徐選手資格問題、大函昨亦正式函覆該領隊、謂土季淮已查明並無問題、郝春德徐亨業由大會取消其本屆比賽資格、選手資格問題、至此正式結束、</p>

<p>邱飛海對錢耀彬同時複賽　王文正直落三敗於許承基</p>
<p>全國網球大會至昨日止、已達複賽週、昨單打半複賽、上海林　華邱飛海幾乎全軍覆沒、在極度危險而以爲必敗之局面下、倖得勉度難關、分別將馬來亞林望蘇及陳其安二人淘汰、遂得參與今日之複賽、亦云幸矣、另兩組爪哇許承某以直落三擊敗王文正、頗爲容易、王起初抵抗甚力、但連負兩盤後、竟無心戀戰門志全消、錢耀彬對曾端才之比賽一如滬馬之戰、亦經五盤之久長逐鹿、錢卒以抵抗到底之精神、獲彼最後之勝利焉、</p>
<p>今日林許複賽</p>
<p>單打所剩最後四人、爲第一單打許承基林寳華、第二單打邱飛海錢耀彬、即於今日下午一時起舉行複賽、兩組優勝者日後再决錦標、許承基之呼聲、自是最高、按照本屆大會訂定之規程、冠軍之外、尚須另决二三四名、假定邱飛海擊敗錢耀彬、林寳華敗於許承基、則林邱二人、尚須作同單位之兄弟戰、以决第二第二名、</p>
<p>重申特訂規程</p>
<p>本屆網球錦標制度、與前不同、爲促進競爭興趣起見、特訂類似公開性質之比賽、兼計團體名位、其法固善但各單位均不明究竟、以致弄巧成拙、病端叢生、本報曾一再申論、奈當局不謀補救辦法、時至今日、各賽員因利害關係、才明瞭此種特殊之競賽方法、得勝者固屬喜出望外、失敗者無不怨聲載道、今半複賽結果、馬華林望蘇陳其安王文正、均已先後淘汰、照章第四名亦已絕望、而錢耀彬旣入複賽、則已穩得第四矣、寗非笑話、如編排秩序、不將第一及第二單打分開鄭列、（先得理想中之最佳八名提出、再將其餘之第一第二單打選手混合編列））或不致有目前之弊端百出也、</p>
<p>滬馬雙打改期</p>
<p>又比賽秩序排列、亦殊欠妥善、五盤　勝制之比賽、絕對不能在同一日之下午舉行、時間旣不够精力尤不濟、如昨日馬華對上海之比賽、單打劇戰五盤之後、尚須繼續再賽雙打、更以單雙打之選手均係相單、單打賽後、各人已疲備萬分、幾有舉步爲難之勢、如何能冉賽雙打、且天色亦晚、不得不改期、爪哇對四川之雙打、因單打完畢較早、雖繼續舉行、仍半途而止、未能結束、成二比一盤、四川佔先、延至今日上午九時續賽、滬馬則改於明日上午九時、茲將昨日單打競賽經過、分述如下、</p>
<h3 id="c213">林寶華 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>經狂風暴雨　而重覩虹霓</p>
<p>雙林之戰、經五盤苦鬥、始决勝負、林望蘇爲有名之牛皮糖、而林寳華之耐心、顯見長足之進步、否則必爲望蘇敗矣、至其獲勝要訣、在能善用切球、否則亦决不能攻破林望蘇之牛皮擊抽也、</p>
<p>挽救狂瀾</p>
<p>開首一盤、二人抽來抽去、望蘇穩健有加、竇華屢有目殺、連負三局、霎時間、林望蘇以五比一遙領前導、林寶華不甘　伏、抖擻精神、用或遠或近、或左或右之切　誘望蘇奔跑、果然藥到病除、馬到成功、連得四局、造成五五平手、望蘇兌不能越過勝盤之最後一局、旋六比六後、寳華以攻破望蘇之發球局、下局自己發局、遂以八比六挽救狂瀾、反敗爲勝、</p>
<p>一蹶不振</p>
<p>之態、管束力薄弱、球多自殺、月萎靡不振、殺氣全無、望蘇穩健如昔、專以兩角拍球窘敵、竟使寶華一籌莫展、在輕描淡寫中、望蘇以六比一勝、下盤起、寳華以全力攻擊、取得首局後、忽又一蹶不振、每况愈下、鬥志消失望蘇再勝六比一、極爲容易、｜</p>
<p>難關重重</p>
<p>斯時林寶華疲畢露、咸以爲必敗無疑、第四盤競爭不久實華即以一比四負、時邱飛海隣塲邱飛海、亦已連負兩盤、岌岌可危、在傍觀戰之上海綱球隊指導張子震、觸景情傷、溜之大吉、不忍覩彼二人之慘敗結果、良久、再來時、張見形勢大變、忽又拍手蹈足、喜出望外、蓋此是林寳華在二比五、三比五、四比五、　有幾次僅差一記失盤之千鈞一髮中、力堵黃河决口、重登　席、反以七比五打個平手矣、</p>
<p>女子四白公尺接力决賽糾紛眞相之一（起點時上海在第六道（一）馬來（二）河南缺席（三）靑島（四）江蘇缺席（五）北平（六）上海（七）廣東（八）福建（王開及國際社攝）</p>
<p>重見虹霓</p>
<p>荀延殘喘、苦盡甘來、加以數千觀衆拍掌捧塲、寶華精神益振、態度興奮、雖極度疲惓、反不覺其疲矣、反之、林望蘇屨次可勝而敗、反覺心慌意亂、越是小心、越不濟事、第五盤中、望蘇反不及林寳華之穩健、且一再自投羅網、實華之反手抽球、或近則網側、或深入底角、使望蘇招架爲難、三比一時、邱飛海已得勝休戰、實華特趨前握手慶賀、難兄難弟、狀殊悽惻、未幾、林寳華亦自四比一而五比二、卒以六比三重見釘霓、望蘇慘敗、邱飛海亦即掏前與寳華擁抱一番、相視作苦笑、觀者亦爲之神傷、</p>
<p>女子四百公尺接力决賽糾紛眞相之二（終點上海在第五道（一）馬來（二）缺（三）靑島（四）北平（五）上海（六）缺（七）廣東（八）福建</p>

<p>吃盡苦中苦　方爲人上人</p>
<p>邱飛海對陳其安、上塲兩盤中、邱各以四比一佔優、而結果反各以四比六連負兩盤、危急萬分、竟不意往後連陞三級、反敗為勝、亦之險矣、</p>
<p>得而復失</p>
<p>邱陳二人擊法如同一轍、各以軟球攻擊、每球之勝負、必經極久之來往、二人殺氣全無、狀甚幽默、邱飛海風頭頗佳、四比一先據勝勢陳其安奔跑還擊、不稍示弱、打成各四、邱竟一籌莫展、反以四比六負、下局情形同前、邱又以四比一再佔上風、但結果又以四比六敗、惜之至、</p>
<p>連陞三級</p>
<p>老邱雖老、後勁當足、雖負兩余仍有把握可贏果然老邱成竹在胸、不慌不忙、步步爲營、徐圖宏展、連陞三級、雨過天靑、第三盤六比二、寫寫意意、第四盤劇戰甚久、驚險萬狀、老邱卒以五比五接、連下二局、七比五、飛過海洋、太平無事、饅後一盤、陳其安疲於奔命、自殺頻逞、邱又以六比一吃得苦中苦、方得人上人、</p>
<h3 id="c215">許承基 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>連拔三城　容易之至</p>
<p>爪哇名將許承基、球藝超羣、不同凡響、連日作戰、一路順風、從未失敗一盤、實屬難能可貴、昨戰四川代表王文正、亦以直落三獲得複賽權、王文正原係滬上好手、惟與許相較、不啻小巫之見大巫、且性情魯芥、涵養全無、運動員應有之精神道德、更絕無僅有、勝則志高氣昂、目空一切、敗則怒容滿面、怨天尤人、自暴自棄、敷衍了事、故其失敗也宜矣、</p>
<p>表演美滿</p>
<p>昨日戰情、初起時局勢緊張、表演美滿、王連失兩盤後、即一蹶不振、形勢散漫、第一盤戰後、王始扳回一局、旋許又以四比二局遙領前茅、次局王發球、接連雙失誤、斷送是局、許籍犀利之發球、以六比二先獲首盤、</p>

<p>牽絲扳藤　劇戰五盤</p>
<p>爪哇曾瑞才、球藝平平、惟以耐久見長、四川錢耀彬不過爾爾、但偶有峻急抽搫、比數變方、半盤第二盤、錢小心應戰、大有起色、以四比一、五比三、一再佔前、曾拚命反攻、造成各五平手、入後錢又連取兩局、七比五各勝一盤、第三盤歷時最久、你一局我一局、各不相讓、而每記須來往上數次、方分高下、各一各二、直至各六、小錢居先、是時手力乏、野球自殺、屢見不鮮、因之被曾加上兩局、以八比六告終、休息再戰、小錢勇氣倍增、出球有力、隨心所欲、一帆風順、連勝四局、曾見局勢危險、奮起力追、果然風頭轉移、打成各四和局、但劇戰之下、已感力竭、錢見有機可乘、乃拚命抽擊、頻施壓迫、六比四造成各二盤平手、</p>
<p>再接再厲</p>
<p>下盤爲生死關頭、各出全手以爭、但小錢自得上盤後、鋒頭史健、並有從旁打氣者、一冉鼓勵、故形勢急轉直下、三比一、四比二、高居上風、曾沈着應戰、不動聲色、並以牛皮糖之方法窘敵、錢則火星直冒、一味抽壓、不料用足勁道、都成野球、或則自殺、曾則以選待勞、步步高陞、三元連中、反以五比四後來居上、下局曾發球、以四十對三十勝、再得一球、即可高唱凱旋、惜功敗垂成、自殺造成平手、入後又因求勝心切、隨處碰壁、手則穩健有加、小心謹愼、以七比五獲得最後勝利、</p>

<p>第一盤王發球得利、許承基照樣還敬、造成各一、入後二許上綱攔殺、連勝三局、以四比一佔先、十錢拚命力追、加上兩局、以三比四落後、旋被二許高壓據綱、勝利雙收、以六比三結束、第二盤王錢破釜沉舟矢志報仇、二許雖奪得首局、但得不償失連負五局、四川組以五比一高居上風、二許小心翼翼、鎭靜作戰、名將威風、確屬不凡連陞三級、僅以四比五落後、其間雙方短兵相接競爭極烈、一時空氣極度緊張、惟四川組以機不可失、竭力進攻、終以六比四奪回一盤、第三盤、二許知大敵當前、不敢輕視、遂悉心進取砲彈式之發球、重若泰山之高壓、迭建功勳、王錢亦抱雪恥壯志更爲小心、追隨左右、寸步不離尤以小錢奮發有爲、表演特佳、雙方時或短兵相接、時或長抽來往、精彩之處、掌聲雷動、五比四·六比五·二許一路居先、小錢發球、造成和局、旋王錢反以七比六超前、下局王發球、二許各一野球、光局終塲、四川遂以八比六後來居上、時天色已晚、展期續賽、</p>

<p>四十九比三十九</p>
<p>南京對菲律濱男籃球次賽、於昨日上午九時、在體育館內舉行、開賽前刻鐘、四週看　、已告客滿、四十分鐘劇戰結果、憑共區區富之經騐、迅急之投籃、以四十九對三十九之比數、戰敗菲軍詳情如後、</p>
<p>梅花陣勢　堅如金湯</p>
<p>南京隊初以唐　堃張長淸李震中王士選趙志華五將應戰、菲島楊家將、亦未出塲、開賽未一分鐘、李震中雙手一揚、紀錄遂開、繼復罰進一分、菲島馬文九還以顏色、亦中一球、小唐指揮之軍、排成梅花陣勢、堅如金湯、得隙即以迅雷不及掩耳之手段、深入敵軍腹地、破籃而返、分數激增、遙遙以二十三對十領前、菲軍見勢不佳、楊氏兄弟、先後出馬、果然各將身手、初上塲即大顯顏色、一口氣追成十八對二十三、此時李靂中唐　堃忽奮起當年神勇、以極優美之傳遞、連擲帶罰、以二十八對二十結束上半時、</p>
<p>小唐離塲授衣帶詔</p>
<p>易地再戰後、大將唐寳堃、忽聞被罰下塲、全塲為之靂動、李中鐸謹　衣帶詔、號令之軍、鎭靜應戰、張長淸不辱使命、連建兩功、高長明易趙志華登塲、後防愈覺鞏固、菲軍主將楊叔方、因前日戰湖南告時傷腿、實力因受影響但尤免强應戰、一度進成二十八對三十之局勢、但南京五虎、用死拼方法、緊緊看住李震中、又中二球、高長明又遠轉建功又將菲隊拋落、此時京隊張晨淸、菲隊蘇文秀、同時四次犯規、陣勢遂各有搖動、菲隊旣不能超前、南京亦不能多獲、在相持局面之下、鑼聲一響、南京同鄉、眉飛色舞、四十九對三十九、力克菲島、</p>
<p>經騐較差</p>
<p>綜觀昨日兩軍、球藝各有千秋、菲島行軍之迅速、國內無出其右、惟慘遭淘汰經騐　差、甚鮮變化、個人技術、如楊叔方施家器馬文九輩實可列第一流選手南京憑其豐富之經騐老練之打法、以柔克剛、小唐昨日望之似不甚實力、但其專司派司之職、每球之獲、均與其有極大之關係、李震中恃其天賦之身材、跳球時估得不少便宜、後衛高長明進可以攻、退可以守、京隊如早將此人登塲、或不致受偌大威脅、總之菲隊之敗、非技術之不及、實係少臨正式大戰、經騐較差之故耳、</p>

<p>四十一比三十二分</p>
<p>上海對湖北之　賽、於昨晨十時舉行、在一般人意料之中、濕隊必遭淘汰無疑、豈知滬隊昨日如睡獅之初醒、一改前日對山西作戰萎　不振之狀態、小馮出沒敵陣、矯捷非常、孫寳慶把守後方、建功甚偉、長脚陸功過於罪、全隊含作尤佳、湖北隊一籌莫展、僅賴葛克一人、恃其身長力壯、爭得不少江山、劉振元雖有數度優美之表演、然功不能補過、尹鴻祥老、後防遂有空虛之感、該隊上塲如能鎭靜應付、終塲前各能繼續看守、或不致如昨日之慘敗也、</p>

<p>北平對靑島之戰、於昨日下午一時舉行、昨日靑島隊之動作、極爲遲緩、得球在手、舉棋不定、坐使敵人防守網佈成、遂不得已而出之於遠投、又因心慌意亂、每難中的、反造成對方得球近攻之機會、北平隊則以高速度之派司及籃下之投擲、其打法與菲島、如出一輙惟經騐變化、則過之、如該隊獲得决賽權、南京之錦標、恐尚有幾分棘手也、</p>
<p>山綫跳球後、牟作雲如燕子穿簾敵籃兩破、李鶴　身高力壯、跳球佔盡便官、籃下一托、　不費力、牟右鋒三罰三中、以十對〇佔先、靑島遠敗失射、又成十七對二、張毓才扳回數分後、成二十四對六、終以二十五對七大勝上半時鳴金再戰、孔　益連獲三分、張王鋒亦各中一只、頗有轉回危局之勢、斯時平隊柱石牟作雲、四次規犯、被罰下塲、靑軍　　直攻、看看已近、至十八對三十六分數距離不遠，平隊急將李鶴鼎調任衛士、于敬老劉雲章又大事猖獗、靑隊又形落後、終以六十一對三十一、北平獲複賽權、</p>

<p>滬曰馬港明日複賽　今日收兵小作休息</p>
<p>昨日足球複賽兩塲上午九時、香港以八比一痛擊北平、平軍出全力監峴球王李惠堂行動、完全採取少輸主義、結果能扳回龔、確極光耀、下午四時、馬來亞戰天津、津方陣綫實力均有可觀、極　抵抗能事、但五鋒傳球遲緩、內衛亦錯悞重重、終陷於不可收拾地步、結果五比零、河北覆敗、香港與馬來亞獲得複賽權、今日休息一天、十八日滬粵馬四隊爭决賽權、健兒角逐、當有一希極劇烈之競爭也、</p>

<p>扳回一隻免吃鴨蛋</p>
<p>昨晨九時</p>
<p>香港對北平之足球戰開始、變方實力懸殊、北平全取守勢、反攻機會絕少、三四人追隨球王李惠堂、然李乘輒射球、屢能中的、殊難能可貴、開賽後、港隊全軍進攻、黎兆榮首開紀錄、李惠堂繼之、又勝一球、平軍見來勢太兇、　師防守、而黎兆榮在混亂中再奏凱歌、成三與零之比、旣而平右翼朱成明盤球深入、衝過　榮照防綫、距門三碼、拼命脚、球觸柱入網、鋼門措手不及、徒喚奈何、其後混戰良久、黎兆榮　機又是一隻、此時李惠堂因平隊監視過嚴、轉讓中堅黃美順活動、姜順不負所托、遠射中的、最后球王亦獲一球、上半時以六比一告終、勝利諸香港、</p>
<p>易地再戰</p>
<p>平方調集全軍、坐鎭門前、排爲一字長陣、抵抗侵略港隊攻城凡二十分鐘求有建樹、因改以鄭季良任　鋒、李碩友、何家强先後整上陣、練習脚頭、於是攻勢稍懈、平軍乃稍稍出動、還他顏色、無奈鋼鬥利害、難越雷池一步、而黎兆榮鄭季良又先後攻陷一球、下半時結果二對零、總分八比一、香港獲　複　槍、</p>

<p>頭項脚盤戰極神妙　冀軍五鋒稍嫌遲緩</p>
<p>馬冀之戰</p>
<p>昨日下午四時開始、河北攤有孫　敬·姜璐·陳而德諸宿將、實力不弱、戰來尚有精神、惜冀軍五鋒動作失之遲緩、內衛綫亦較薄　馬來亞傳球迅速、頭頂腳　咸極神妙、目勇敢絕倫　攻門功夫尤有研究、翼　能保　零對五之紀錄、已羅難能矣、</p>
<p>戰幕旣啓</p>
<p>混戰十分鐘後、　慶福接到後方傅　妙球、前　到後方　　妙球、首開紀錄、　軍不甘雌伏、孫福來　聯邊防進攻、然爲　德　林西挾　阻、未有發展、俄而姚勝華繼謝建功又獲一球、其後二十分鐘內、冀門雖險軍反攻、憔閃球運不佳、脚并沒有亦不甚準確、乃不賽效、未幾、姚勝華崔　重來冉陷一城、上半塲成　比〇、馬華隊佔先、</p>
<p>繼續作戰</p>
<p>下半時冀隊全取攻勢力求恢復失地、然屢攻不下、又被梁來佛乘間打進一只、開下半塲紀錄、姜璐大勢去、難以挽回乃誓師邊陲、進窺敵陣、無李脚頭無靈、又爲黃錦柏將球救出、孫永泉快馬加鞭、亦　陷敵、未幾張德明彈不虛發、命中馬軍要害、又爲黃柏抵當出來、尹金振得前街妙傳、快馬加鞭、奔馳上陣、勢成單刀、但爲劉世藩所截、冀隊反見得勢、三鋒出拐子馬陣聯成　氣、進陷馬防、蔡文禮　岸麟回師救駕姜璐雖趨前恊助、亦未　功、謝慶福於將完塲時、因前衛遠送高球、又得　　入綱、成　比　、總結果五比零、馬來亞勝、　勢如下、</p>

<p>女子綱球、昨日僅有雙打複賽兩塲、山西上海兩對姊妹花、因寮務懸殊、成　面　之局擊、山西組連以兩個光盤獲得　　　、四川馬華兩組、形勢尚稱平均、故稍有競爭、惟雙方技術平平、無足可取、四川組以穩健勝、俱與普滬相較、恐不足與之抗衡也、　觀　近形勢、山西穤得冠軍、滬隊有亞軍希望、四川馬華分列三四、昨賽鈷　如下、</p>
<p>王氏姊妹</p>
<p>球　高明、搭配雙打、尤為佳妙、春菁善攻、春藏善守、攻守兼備、相得益彰、魏家同胞、略遜一籌、麥谷穩健可取、租同欄網見長、兩人合作、似　聯絡、因之時有錯誤、予對五襲擊之機會、春藏於單打半複賽中、相遇麥谷、劇戰三盤、慘遭淘汰、心實不甘、昨日雙打、狹路相見、分外眼紅、故開賽降、晋軍即取攻勢、炮火連天、彈如雨下、滬隊陣裏風聲　淚、草木皆兵二王手下無情大施壓迫、而魏抬架爲難、還手無力、兩盤結束、鴨蛋成變、</p>

<p>熟門一熟路馬來先勝</p>
<p>馬來亞男排球、昨日挾其餘威、力殺福建、馬來有又名鄭心敏之勇、而全隊無合作功夫、其勝似倖於一時、今日複賽、輪對廣東、恐非用一白二十分力量、難言取勝、馬來僑胞、其各勉諸、第一局開始、福建吳必盛發球、馬來欄網失利、先失一分、比輪　廖家德發球直追、收獲二分、好成均勢、從此你來我往、彼此在有得失、惟馬來究以熟門熱路、得以二十一比十九之、分差數、先卜第一局、</p>
<p>砲大震天流彈四射</p>
<p>第二局閩方急圖反攻、馬來防閑亦力、中排兩冀殺、雙方皆用火功、前排閂門、乃大見重要、惟以彈雨之密、遂致砲聲震大、看台座客、亦無時不有流彈危險、上半局以十一對七、馬來佔優勢、下半局福建吳必盛發球、平直而急、馬來後陣恐慌、一度混亂、失落七分、於是又成平局、馬來差幸、球心之靈、認閩軍旣報瓊餚、亦應投以桃李、乃連手還報、一氣四分、裁判員當宣佈勝屬馬來、是局比數爲二十　對十六、</p>
<p>放過機會坐失要寨</p>
<p>第三局、並無特殊顏色、福建實力有限、二局爭殺、已非易事、時軍心慌張、自殺甚多、且攔綱殺球、僅利於平切若因勢硬殺、則易爲敵區頭排關門拒客、閩方於此過門不熟、故屢有機會、皆遭敗北、拼殺結果爲廿一比十五、馬來遂以三對〇之勝利、得複賽權、</p>

<p>實力懸殊餓虎撲犬</p>
<p>起廣東排球、向來大有名頭、本屆錦標形勢、足與上海相抗者、亦惟此羊城健兒、北平隊雖亦並不算弱、但與廣東相較、則　乎後矣、第一局廣東先發制人、一神老將丯彩、確屬鎭　鍜練、但見球點落下、辄中故都防地、一時平方陷入四路包抄之啼、左右衝突、終無出路、第一局結果、二十一比八、實力之　、以概可見、</p>
<p>一度堅張終仍不振</p>
<p>第二局、北平　見生動、粵國諸角、亦因驕輕敵、於平北氣燄頓高、上半局以十一比九佔先、下半局廣東依然不振、昔日威風、於今何在、遂急下苦功、北平以是局天下大勢、已之有其　、亦不敢放鬆一步、於是分數緊接、長靠短打、各盡　職、是役情彩、確屬不少、顧於各二十一時、仍爲廣東力殺而敗、比數爲二十二對二十一、</p>
<p>直　三局粵將凱捷第三局北平捉襟見時、上塲即有守無攻、紀錄報分、動輙廣東、上半局北平僅得五分、下半局仍是不景氣、側座雖有拉拉隊、亦屬隔岸觀火、無關得失、終局時爲二十一對十、廣東以直落三凱捷、得複賽權、</p>

<p>一串連珠選報喜訊</p>
<p>北平與河北、猶香　與廣東、般人皆謂本是同根生、相煎何太急、下午一時由郭子萍裁判開賽、河北莊進輝首開紀錄、但時未閱久、北平即反攻得勢、串連珠、選報喜訊、上半局址一比六、平軍先下一局、聲氣頓壯、</p>

<p>心亂如蔴飲恨千古</p>
<p>第三局冀方大用功夫、安淑卿韓燕蓀於休息時間、早經商就夜襲渝營、故是局初上塲後、突起風雲、平方　瀕危境、一時鶯嗔燕咤、酷似天災人福、大難臨頭、半局換塲、冀方已以十一比五佔優勢、迨區域變更、北平小姐何世瑾、盛努之下、橫掃千軍、進佔甚多、　進旅退之局、北平又居上風、河北心亂如　、竟一失足中、飲恨千古最後之勝利、仍歸北平、比數爲二十一對十五、北平得複賽權、</p>

<p>蘇州小姐來勢可怕</p>
<p>女排球湖南前　馬來亞、頗覺聲色並茂、昨戰江蘇、前排殺手多失、後排救險不力、其　故意彈琵琶歟、則爲觀衆一般之疑問也、三時開賽、江蘇無錫蘇州兩地之精銳、操練未久、共敗自宜、上塲以後、湖南首開惡戰、江蘇禮讓爲懷、一輸半打、耐尼無錫同鄉看臺上亦有不少、見此情形、連喊加油、張嘉佩袁國榮總算掙氣、追獲數分、半塲終結、湖南湘軍仍居前導、換過壁壘、江蘇　　平發球、　長身玉力、粗膀大脚、大有南人北相氣慨、球前如窮、湘軍老鄉、啊呀不迭、中排翟美英、前二年平屬上海著名排球戰將、現雖略見落伍、但活潑可人、則未減當年丯彩、於是前中後、一致聯絡、搭配平均、使龍鑑平連造八分、湖南姐姐、頓時英雄氣短、以十三比二十一先負一局、</p>
<p>努力進攻再見顏色</p>
<p>第二局江蘇　舊用力進攻、湖南殺手劍、竟然無從施展、觀衆皆爲莫名厥妙、上半塲分數雖極接近、惟下半塲中、江蘇中後排表演獨隹、撲地救出險球甚多、泥裏嬌娘、亦顧不得口紅胭脂、湖南娘姑、似亦經騐不足、見江蘇連連得分、即至手足無措、其實江蘇隊於輕襲時固能守、而血戰時不足言攻、湘軍則未見及此馴致發球時連次自殺、以十七比二十一再敗於江蘇、</p>
<p>看出破綻一馬當先</p>
<p>第三局、湖南稍變陣容、而指導員於江蘇破綻、亦詳加指示、陳嘉傑劉興衡、居然一馬當先、開路衝鋒、江蘇張嘉佩人長手弱、湖南三斧頭畢竟不凡、一時抵抗無術陣綫大亂、瞿美英雖滿塲飛舞、獨木究不成林、於是以十二比二十一初敗於湘軍、第四局、湖南見江蘇吃硬不吃軟、似已尋獲漏洞、對　發藥、當然白發百中、江蘇一失再失、旁觀者先爲担心、打足氣筒、仍是一籌莫展、於是自十一比九換塲、而至二十一比十七終局、江蘇湖南、成二對二之平手、</p>
<p>五戰三勝淘汰江蘇</p>
<p>五局勝負要關、少不得大家要小心冀冀、蘇州小姐、本擬拉出後備名角馮玉珍上塲、惟馮自田賽競爭失敗後、心緒不寗、芳軀違和未復、於是仍以原班應戰、然以　　已慣之師、怎能經此長時間之殺伐、故欲圖保持平衡局面、亦幾難得、上半塲以十比十一　居不風、下塲爭　　起、無如以殺球技術、動輙反身平出、湖南易於防阻接救而終歸淘汰、比數爲十八對二十一、湖南以三比二得女排球複賽懽、</p>

<p>男子摔角决賽結果</p>
<p>男子組摔角決賽於十六日上午仍在國術塲舉行、各戰將準時到塲、環立四週、此乃摔角最後之一幕、勝敗在此一舉、故各戰將虎視耽耽、披上戰甲、摩拳擦掌、咬牙切齒奮力殺敵、以博最後之勝利、故爲最精彩之一塲、南京大力士馬文奎乘其戰勝之餘威出塲待戰、應戰者爲山東胡煥彬、胡知非馬之敵手、自願棄權、北平大胖子張文山雖曾爲馬所殺倒、但一夜之休養已能恢復原氣、先與山東胡煥彬交鋒、胡亦不甘示弱、連戰二合、無分勝負、但張大胖子於第三第四次比賽時用其全力將胡扭倒地上、於是大胖子仍得名列亞軍、輕量組之譚祖秀中量組之下恩富亦力戰羣雄得最後之勝利、茲將優勝名次錄後、</p>

<p>常熟龐媛玉小姐、前左蘇省運動曾時曾轟動一時、不料麗小姐於由次全運會中、除跳高獲得第五名外、其他如百公尺跌遠等均遭落　、近日深居　出、</p>
<p>有見短跑家李森小姐之　名者覺其　灑老練、不知女子　　據左右謂、李小姐於事　對簽名曾式卜過數用苦功、故有用等筆織、信不信由你、</p>

<h3 id="c258">東菲又將成立一傀儡國 <a href="#c258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>意阿之戰，雖國聯已判定意大利爲東菲戰事的戎首，决議引用　約第十六條，對意實施制裁，但此舉並不能使墨索里尼畏懼，改變其軍事行動。據羅馬近日傳來消息，官塲方面，已公然表示，墨索里尼計劃有阿國的一部分領十中，另立新國，而以底格勒省前任省長，最近以一萬二千人，投降意軍的葛夫柴，爲該國的傀儡皇帝。這段新聞，雖然極平淡，但却比那些佔　奪地，投彈殺人的戰報，來得引人注意。</p>
<p>說起新國的建立，及傀儡呈帝的出　，並不　東菲佔　。在三年前，東亞卽有這一個奇跡。不過將來這塲醜劇，或許又要在東菲，由另一班角色扮演一番。　眞是無獨有偶。原來近今　大之　人國者，自己不願胃大不韙之名，給旁人指為是侵略國。於是為掩盡天下人的耳目計，它們便想出一個巧妙的方法，在侵略地建立一新國，再尋一個人來做這新國的傀儡首領，自己就暗躱在背後操　指揮，這時倘有人要出來干涉，它們便說，這是一種「已成的事實」，而且又於已無干，叫你無法對付。這種策略，三年前有人試騐過，果然成功，如願以償。故現在意大利亦想東施效　，計劃要這一套把戲。</p>
<p>不過要擁一個傀儡做皇帝，却亦是一伴難事。因爲傀儡皇帝，並非隨便任何人都有資格做，一定要尋一個有特殊地拉的人物才成。東亞的傀儡皇帝，大家都知道，是一個最合格的人物。東菲這一個未來的傀儡皇帝，雖與阿王並無血統的關係，但據他自稱，他是一八七二年至一八九九年，治理阿國的約翰四世的後裔，這屨歷亦是再合格沒有的。怪不得羅馬某報，在葛夫柴倒戈投意之後，要標出一「合法的王位承繼人已向阿京的僭號者叛變」的題目，說葛夫柴爲新羅門王的嫡裔，而前王曼耐立克及今王哈理賽拉西，俱屬僭位。而且又有某報要指出當一九三二年，意王愛麥虞限三世，巡閱伊利特里亞時，曾延見底格爾省各大酋長，卽葛夫柴亦在其列，這人當時曾要求意大利加以優待，並向意相墨索里尼，表示服從之意。</p>
<p>葛夫柴的背叛阿王，於意大利十分有利，意軍總司令部，以爲這是軍事勝利的朕兆。聞意軍得其合作，南向進發，以斷京吉鐵道，當再無重大的阻碍。倘有其他酋長來降，則征服阿國所需時間，當可大爲减少。似此，東菲新國，不久或可成立。而叛將葛夫柴，亦可以大做其傀儡國王矣。</p>
<h3 id="c259">塡表 <a href="#c259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— 達</p>
<p>黃之興在翠綠濃蔭的棕櫚樹底下沿着修長的柏油馬路踉踉蹌蹌地走着，右手不住地摸着熱辣辣的發燒的臉頰，從他身旁擦過的黑得像炭頭般的異國的人們，他們的那雙耿耿閃溜溜的眼睛，在今天的黃之興看起來，無論如何總覺得是蘊含着一點侮辱，鄙視的神氣，這越使他對於異國人的憎恨，他握緊拳頭，恨恨地打着自己的左手的掌心，憤怒地自語着：</p>
<p>「媽的，老子眞不想再蹬住在這臭地方！——誰道不在這臭地方討生活就會餓死嗎？」心火熊熊地燒着，燒着，像天空里炎炎的太陽。</p>
<p>黃之與是個年紀約莫二十左右的年靑的小夥子，剛卒業中等教育之後，爲了减輕家庭里的負擔和帮助家庭的一部份的經濟，他不得不離開鄉井，飄到南國來渡着冷板橙的生活，然而年來的異國的華僑教育，受居留政府的種種的苛刻的束縛，限制，與刁難，這冷板橙是很難捱過的，尤其是在這兒當教書匠的，先决的條件，得讀懂那西藏文似的異國底怪異的文字，受他們的嚴厲的考試，方才成功哩！</p>
<p>當他每天苦心的在燈光下很吃力地讀熟那些怪異的異國文字的時候，心窩里總是憤憤然地，像有一股猛烈的火燄在冒着，想：「幹嗎要讀這撈什子文字呢，我又不想教他們的番文？」</p>
<p>然而，爲了生活，黃之興不得不忍住心窩里這股猛烈的火，埋着頭死死板板地讀下去。</p>
<p>今天，一淸早，校長周先生就衝進教員宿舍來，嘴巴圓圓的張開着，兩隻眼睛笑瞇瞇的賸一條綫縫，看樣子準是有什麽興頭兒。他一衝進來就大聲地嚷若：</p>
<p>「小黃，恭喜你！教育部來了公函，你的番文已考及格了，祇要你等一會到部里去塡寫一張表就行了。」</p>
<p>「嗯…」微微地點點腦袋。</p>
<p>他木然地完全沈浸在過去的回憶里。他想起到這里來當教書匠已經整整的半年了，在這半年中，他無時無刻不在過着私倡似的偷偷摸摸的生活，這自然是因爲他還未能考番文及格的緣故。記得有一次，他正在講臺上對學生大講着國文作法。當他講到正够勁兒的時侯，陡然地一個茶房忽忽忙忙　闖進來，吃吃艾艾地說：「黃先生，査—學員—來了！」於是，他急忙地走下臺來，一溜烟似地；另外又級里的年長而又能懂　文的學生，站上講臺上去代替一下，像這樣的滑稽劇，在這半年中不知道扮演過多少趟，現在他已算够上當敎書匠的資格了，從今後他總算是一個出過字的公倡，用不着　暗地里偷偷摸摸　摸索了。想到這里，不自　地抿着嘴微微地笑着。</p>
<p>吃過早飯之後，黃之興穿著得很齊整地到教育部里去。在會客室里，他孤單單的坐着，耐心地等下去，看門頂上的壁鐘一秒一秒迂緩地走着，一直捱過三個鐘頭，他覺得從外面走過的那些拖着尾巴的「奔龍」（裙似的底服裝）的教育官，在他們的心眼中，誰個都沒有他的存在？於是，他的心火又在熊熊地燃燒着，「媽的，老子眞沒有耐心來吃這一碗飯呢！」心底里這麽地響着。</p>
<p>陡然地，從小門探出半個黑炭頭似的腦袋來，問：</p>
<p>「幹嗎，中國人？」一種若無其事傲然的神氣。</p>
<p>「填表。」淡淡地回腔。</p>
<p>「進來。」隨手遞給他一張表格。</p>
<p>從姓名，籍貫以至於「犯過罪否？」和「敢擔保不違犯政府的勾當？」這些滿含着侮辱的條文，黃之興都忍耐着性子平心的塡寫，雖則越塡寫越使他的心靈刺傷得疼痛得難堪。最後就是臨到蓋着十多個的指印。</p>
<p>「幹嗎要蓋指印呢？」黃之興有點不服氣地問。</p>
<p>「誰敢擔保你們這些下流的中國人？」哈哈地獰笑着，鄙夷地。</p>
<p>「你們才是下流的東西！……」冒着的氣已經忍壓不住了，火山似地爆發出來。</p>
<p>「拍…拍…」送過來兩下沈重的巴掌。「狗，給我滾，下流的東西！配得上做教師嗎？你知道這是什麽地方？……滾！」</p>
<p>「媽媽的，老子眞不想再蹬在這齷齪的地方！……」恨恨地把表擰成一團，用力地扔在地上，頭也不回地路出了教育部的大門。</p>
<p>黃之興在翠綠濃蔭的棕櫚樹底下踉跟蹌蹌地走着，右手不住地摸着熱辣辣的發燒的臉頰，他覺得從他身邊擦過的那些黑的像炭頭似的異國的人們，他們的那雙耿耿的眼睛，都蘊藏着一點對他侮辱，鄙視的敵意。</p>
<h3 id="c260">盲歌女 <a href="#c260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— 梁啟筠</p>
<p>盲歌女阿鳳有着浮萍一般的命運。——流浪，飄零。浮在水上似的無定止的生活是多凄苦的呢。</p>
<p>她，由鄉村流到市鎭，由市鎭又流到大都會來了。她體諒過北地的風氣是怎麽地樸質，剛毅，沈着；和南國的景物是怎麽地艷　，嫵媚，溫靜。但，她也史懂得生活是辛酸的，苦澀的。於是，時日多了，飄流之於她，正像每個人都要喫飯一樣。</p>
<p>古卜賽人的故事是美麗的：可是，她的心却是悒鬱的。……</p>
<p>據說藝術是會感動人的心境。阿鳳未曾進過學校，而且，從十二歲起，雙目就失了明，所以壓根兒就不懂得什麼叫做藝術。然而，到處受人不因器官的缺陷底憎厭而反去奉迎她，這是她深引以爲榮幸的一回事呢。</p>
<p>那一晚，天色分外地淸朗。</p>
<p>明澈的深秋下弦月，在凝潔的淡墨色的天空上，趨赴着永遠走不完的旅程。</p>
<p>星星閃爍着發光的眼珠子。</p>
<p>阿鳳的眼珠子已經有六個年頭不曾閃過亮了。——隕落的黑子呵。</p>
<p>大亞酒樓的喜筵上，有一個賓客，（那脚色是曾爲阿鳳的藝術所感動過的。）倡議在萬朶紅綠俺映的花叢中，點綴一朵小小的靑色的花，是別有一番風味的。</p>
<p>於是，這百多個俗物又得一次聆到盲歌女的動人的藝術。</p>
<p>阿鳳來了。</p>
<p>俊俏的高樹子，身體裏在深紫　色的衣服中。許多人都太息地惋惜地說：</p>
<p>——幹嗎她少了一對閃亮的星呢</p>
<p>短瘦的雅片鬼型的岑　弄着曲調的過門。隨着，盲歌女開口啦。「霸王別姬」，多慷慨，激昂，而又感傷的曲子呵。琴聲和曲聲，在沈　的，渴抑着自己的情感的，幾乎是窒息的空氣里邊打着旋轉，打着旋轉。……</p>
<p>曲聲像波，人們的心緒像浪，彼此一同起，一同伏。</p>
<p>在人們的情威達到最緊張的高峯時，驀地，曲完了。於是，許多人的情感又好像在火熱的烈日下，驟然掉進冰窖里似的。大家壓抑在心胸里的一口氣，直至這時纔得鬆下。</p>
<p>同情於她的人都又爲她太息了。</p>
<p>（是呵，多可憫惜的事情呢。十八歲的大姑娘，因了器官的缺陷，就失掉了天賦給人底靑春的愉樂。現在是，出賣着自已的情感，蘊藏在心底深處的悲哀呢。</p>
<p>（——孤零，漂泊，流浪，靑春的怨慕，……</p>
<p>（獨身者的悲哀呵。）</p>
<p>接着，在人們的讚頌的掌聲中，她走了。並且，遺留下一個悒鬱的微笑給大家。</p>
<p>或許她裝着愉快的樣子，不讓別人知道她心里的隱秘的憂怨。——</p>
<p>她，盲歌女阿鳳，有着浮萍一般的命運。</p>
<p>——流浪，　零　浮在水上似的無定止的生活是多凄苦的呢。</p>
<p>但，她需要飄流，正像每個人都需要喫飯一樣。</p>
<p>因此，雖然吉卜賽人的故事是美魔的；她的心却永遠是悒鬱的了。……</p>

Participants included Commander Tada, Staff Officer Ishii of the Tianjin Garrison Headquarters, Lieutenant Colonel Ido, Lieutenant Colonel Wakishiro, Military Attaché Murata, Military Attaché Takahashi stationed in Ping, Military Attaché Matsui stationed in Chahar, Military Attaché Hanaya stationed in Jinan, etc. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Dalian) As a result of discussions between the Kwantung Army and the South Manchuria Railway (SMR), the SMR will continue to invest in the Xingzhong Company to actively develop North China. The head office will be located in Tokyo, and branch offices will be established in Shanghai, Dalian, Tianjin, Guangdong, Osaka, and other important related locations. Its main objective is to restore trade relations between China, Japan, and Manchuria, with particular emphasis on developing resources and revitalizing agriculture in North China. The capital is set at 10 million yuan, with an initial payment of 2.5 million yuan. Subsequently, external capital will be absorbed or debts will be incurred as development capital. The main business will still be the promotion of Manchurian special products to China. However, the capital of the Xingzhong Company seems rather small, but it is merely an intermediary agency, and its internal control is still dominated by the influence of the SMR. The Xingzhong Company is an agency for implementing Japan's China policy. Therefore, the Xingzhong Company will also engage in mining and road construction in North China. Initiating projects under the name of the Xingzhong Company is easier to implement and also looks more respectable on the surface. (16th Hualian Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Regarding the matter of the Taiji Mining Company occupying and exploiting the Liu River Mine, representatives Fang Zhiwu and Zheng Songhua of the Liu River Mine recently engaged lawyers in Tianjin to draft a complaint and submit it to the Tianjin District Court in accordance with the Mining Law, accusing Taiji Company of encroachment. The court has already forwarded the documents to the Hebei Construction Department and the Linyu County Government to investigate the case files for review before a trial can be held. The railway, wharf and warehouses of the Liu River Mine leading to Qinhuangdao are now taken over by the Japanese Kwantung Army, designated as a special line for coal transport, and Taiji Company is tasked with being responsible for mining 10,000 tons per month for supply. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Since the Fengzhi War, the railway transporting coal between Qinhuangdao and the Liu River Mine has been forbidden for use by Japanese people, which has prevented the Sino-Japanese joint venture Taiji Coal Mine from mining coal until today. However, as a result of recent negotiations by the Kwantung Army with the North China authorities, they took over the railway in August, and the Taiji Company decided to start mining coal.

<h3 id="e30">China's Economy in the Midst of a War Crisis <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— Ting</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Italo-Ethiopian War, overseas telegrams report that prices in various countries are soaring. Notably, the price of copper in Tokyo rose sharply within a single day. As Italy proceeded to purchase grain in the Far East, the price of rice in Rangoon and Indian stocks also skyrocketed temporarily. Even in our own country, the prices of important commodities, such as steel, pigments, silk yarn, rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains, are steadily increasing. The underlying cause is the increasingly grave crisis of a second world war. The international conflict triggered by the Italo-Ethiopian War has the potential to engulf the European continent and other world powers. World prices are rising due to increased military demand and hoarding by merchants, hence this upward trend.</p>
<p>War is a crisis, but it can also allow a few countries to reap profits. For example, during World War I, the United States transformed from a debtor nation to a creditor nation. Japan laid the foundation for its post-war national power expansion. The social productivity of some countries along the Pacific coast also increased as a result. These are all clear examples. However, during the last World War, China did not seize the opportunity of rising world prices to expand its domestic social production. Moreover, the situation in the Far East is vastly different now compared to then. During this period of war crisis, I fear that our country's merchants will not only fail to profit, but will also suffer greatly. Therefore, how should China's economy seek a way out? I believe that efforts should be made in two areas:</p>
<p>First, China must strive for progress in industrial and agricultural production in order to survive. The outbreak of war is caused by the market plundering of one or two ambitious countries. However, only powerful countries are capable of seizing the opportunity of war to promote their own production. China, with its remaining weakness, wants to follow others and enjoy windfall profits after the outbreak of a major war. This is no longer possible today. The reason is that domestic industrial and agricultural production is on the verge of bankruptcy, and the domestic market is likely to be further controlled by external forces due to the war. However, to seek life in death, the only way is to strive for production.</p>
<p>Second, China must strive for the stability of silver prices. Currently, the United States still holds the power to manipulate the global silver market. The level of world silver prices has a significant impact on Chinese prices. If silver prices can be stabilized, the rise in world prices can promote the development of Chinese production. Conversely, if China's economy continues to suffer from the continued upward fluctuation of silver prices, what way out can there be when the world is in a state of extreme turmoil?</p>
<p>Although the conditions that determine the future of China's economy under the war crisis are not limited to these, the above two are the most important.</p>

<p>France Asks Britain to Reduce Military Strength to Ease Situation, Britain and Italy's Attitudes Cold Towards Peace Proposals</p>
<p>(Paris) French Foreign Minister Laval still believes that the Italo-Ethiopian reconciliation will be a success. Although both Britain and Italy have expressed indifference to being mediators, Laval himself is not discouraged. Laval now hopes that the Pope will invite representatives from the British, French, and Italian governments to participate in a peace conference at the Vatican. The reasons for the current discord between Britain and France are as follows: (1) Laval's proposed reconciliation terms to Mussolini have been deemed unacceptable by the League of Nations and Britain. (2) The French government has not yet provided a satisfactory concrete response to Britain's inquiry regarding British-French naval cooperation in the Mediterranean. (3) Britain is displeased with Laval's support for Mussolini's request that the British navy withdraw its domestic fleet from the Mediterranean. (4) Mussolini's request for France to jointly guarantee the Brenner Pass, a key point between Germany and Austria, is gaining traction. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Paris) It is reported that the peace conditions proposed by France to Italy include the following: (1) The Italian army maintains its current position in Abyssinia. (2) Tigray Province, because its governor, Gokchai, has surrendered to Italy, is to be changed to an autonomous region under Italian protection. (3) Italy receives the provinces of Ogaden and Harar. (4) Italy is allowed to build railways through British territories to facilitate communication between Eritrea and Somalia. (5) Abyssinia is placed under the trusteeship of the League of Nations, with Italy as the primary trustee. Impartial observers here do not believe that Britain will agree to this plan. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to official sources here, when French Premier Laval and Italian Ambassador Cerruti spoke on Sunday, neither side put forward any constructive proposals. A political spokesperson told a Reuters reporter today that while Geneva is considering sanctions and the air is filled with threats against Italy, we believe it is not appropriate to discuss the resolution of the Italo-Ethiopian War. The people in the Abyssinian territory occupied by the Italian army are friendly towards Italy, which proves the correctness of our policy. We are now proceeding in accordance with this policy.

<p>Reducing Military Strength in the Mediterranean, Britain Sends Written Response to France</p>
<p>(London) This morning's cabinet meeting decided on the British Ambassador to France, Clerk's, reply to French Premier Laval, who had recently asked if the Mediterranean fleet could be reduced to normal strength to ease the situation. It is expected that the British Ambassador to France will convey this reply to Laval tonight. London political circles believe that the number of troops in Italian-owned North African Libya has continued to increase significantly in recent days, making the situation serious. The reply will state this point. It is believed that Laval's proposal regarding the British fleet is accompanied by other proposals that have not yet been disclosed. As for the Italian government's statement to France that Italy cannot protect the Brenner Pass without French assistance, the French Premier did not mention it to the British Ambassador. Tonight, French Ambassador to Britain Corbin visited the British Foreign Office. (Reuters Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) It is now known that when French Premier Laval met with the British Ambassador to France on October 14, he mentioned that reducing British military strength in the Mediterranean to a normal level could improve the situation in Abyssinia. He also mentioned Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's statement to French reporters that the number of Italian troops in the Italian North African colony of Libya could also be reduced. At that time, the British Ambassador did not give a direct response on behalf of the British government, but it is expected that the British Cabinet will consider this matter. The British fleet had concentrated in the Mediterranean before the League of Nations invoked Article 16 of the Covenant, so the issue of reducing military strength is a matter for Britain to decide alone. This conversation is unlikely to affect British-French relations, as they are currently very close. It is generally recognized that Laval is eager for the war to end soon.

According to Paris newspapers, French officials are deeply concerned that the relationship between the United States and Italy is becoming increasingly tense and fear that conflicts may occur during this week's discussions in Geneva on implementing sanctions against Italy. However, the allied countries that are in contact with France will likely support Britain in establishing effective sanctions at that time. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) According to Havas News Agency's diplomatic correspondent, the British government has instructed its ambassador to France, Sir Clerk, to continue negotiations with the French government so that the British Navy can use French naval bases in the Mediterranean if the British fleet in the Mediterranean is attacked by Italy. This issue is mostly related to purely technical aspects, and the British government hopes that the British and French naval departments will study it as soon as possible. (Havas Telegram, 15th)</p>

This attitude is not only unfair to Ethiopia but also sacrifices the main principles of adjusting international relations. Therefore, Britain is prepared to participate in any actions that the League of Nations deems necessary to fulfill treaty obligations. Therefore, we are quite surprised by France's current selfish policy.

<p>(Rome) The Italian newspaper "Il Giornale d'Italia" recently published an editorial stating, "The current conflict is not a conflict between Italy and the League of Nations, but a conflict between Britain and Italy. Italy had notified the British government as early as January and February of this year of its intention to use force in East Africa. At that time, Italy invited Britain to jointly study this issue, but Britain ignored it. When the mobilization of the Italian army was completed, Britain suddenly interfered. The proposals made by Britain to Italy offered only two paths: one was to make Italy completely surrender, and the other was to make Italy take serious risks. Britain wanted Italy to choose one of these two paths, and rejected all other means of reconciliation. On the other hand, it forced the League of Nations to implement sanctions and took unilateral naval and financial sanctions even before the League of Nations voted to decide on sanctions. From this perspective, who can believe that the British government's current policy still has a trace of friendship towards Italy?" (Havas Telegram, 15th)</p>

<p>Eden Moves to Boycott Italian Goods, Countries Fail to Reach Consensus</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations is tightening its net on sanctions against Italy. The Economic Subcommittee today read for the first time a list of items essential for military operations and will then continue to consider applying to prohibit these items from being sent to Italy. The list has not yet been published and is said to be divided into two categories: one includes gasoline, coal, and cotton, which are mostly produced in non-League of Nations member states; and the other includes iron, ammonia, and precious metals such as tungsten, which are almost entirely produced in League of Nations member states. It appears that a ban on the first category of goods will have to wait until an agreement can be reached with non-member states before it can be implemented, while it seems that an application to immediately prohibit the second category of goods from being imported into Italy will be made. It is reported that the committee's goal is to start with items that are supplied to Italy entirely or mostly by countries participating in sanctions. The issue of ships, vehicles, manufactured goods, and semi-manufactured goods will be transferred to the Committee of Military Experts. It is reported that the Committee of Military Experts has agreed to expand the list of war materials issued by the US government to include various instruments used in chemical and incendiary warfare, and various gases used in war should be included in the list of prohibited items. The Economic Committee will consider the issue of boycotting Italian exports tomorrow. (Reuters Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Sanctions Committee's Economic Group met today. The British representative, Eden, proposed to immediately begin boycotting general cargo, but since the representatives of various countries have not yet reached a consensus on this proposal, it has been postponed until tomorrow for discussion. The Netherlands, Belgium, the Soviet Union, Sweden, and Turkey have expressed their support in principle, but the wording of the resolution still needs to be revised. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Economic Subcommittee held a short meeting today to discuss the proposal by British representative Eden to boycott Italian exports. The Swiss representative raised some reservations, and the meeting was adjourned at 12:10 PM until tomorrow to allow the representatives time to study Eden's written proposal. Romania, the Soviet Union, Sweden, and Turkey supported Eden's proposal without dissent. The proposal states that the governments intend to prohibit the import of all goods entrusted, produced, or manufactured in Italy or Italian territories. Existing contracts are not exempt from the ban, but goods in transit and personal luggage of travelers transported from Italy and Italian territories are exempt from the ban. Eden declared at the meeting today that 70% of Italy's exports are transported to League of Nations member states. Although Italy is now trying to reduce the import of luxury goods, its gold reserves are flowing out steadily, and the price of the lira has fallen sharply. Prolonging the war will reduce Italy's purchasing power. If a ban is implemented against Italy, its gold resources will be greatly affected. (Reuters Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) This agency's reporter claims that during the Economic Sanctions Committee's discussion of the sanctions plan proposed by British Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, Eden, this morning, the French representative, Coullonteur, explained his country's position, saying that his country is prepared to carry out the various obligations stipulated in Article 16 of the Covenant and will not oppose economic and financial sanctions measures. He added that the proposals made by the British delegation should be supported if their effectiveness is maximized, and that when countries prohibit the import of Italian goods, it is necessary to prevent Italian goods from being transported through other countries. In addition, the representatives of Switzerland, Poland, and Spain have all made reservations regarding the British proposal. (Havas Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Economic Sanctions and Economic Mutual Assistance Committees established by the 18-nation subcommittee of the League of Nations Sanctions Committee were established today. The Economic Mutual Assistance Committee met this morning, with Spanish representative Contos as chairman. After discussions, it was unable to proceed with its work due to a lack of trade figures between Italy and the League of Nations member states. It was decided that the League of Nations Secretariat should copy and send trade statistics between Italy and various countries today so that the subcommittee could proceed with its work based on these figures tomorrow. The objective of the Economic Mutual Assistance Subcommittee is to prevent certain countries from suffering excessive trade losses as a result of implementing sanctions. Regarding this point, Subcommittee Chairman Tangdus declared that the subcommittee's task is not to try to compensate member states for the losses they suffered as a result of implementing sanctions. Member states that participate in sanctions must be prepared to make sacrifices. However, those who sacrifice too much should be given assistance to reduce their sacrifices, which is the objective of the subcommittee's work. In addition, the Economic Sanctions Subcommittee met at 3:30 PM, chaired by the Portuguese representative Vasconcelos. (Havas Telegram, 15th)</p>

<p>(Rome) Responsible parties believe that until the end of the Italian-Abyssinian War, the solidarity of the League of Nations members against Italy will be difficult to maintain. They say that the League of Nations members were not entirely united on the implementation of sanctions, and after a considerable period of time, they will gradually split. Economic figures believe that Italy can resist economic sanctions without feeling any difficulty, at least until the beginning of the East African rainy season next year. By that time, the East African war will surely be able to come to an end. Furthermore, the National Institute for International Trade has already developed plans to resist economic sanctions, and can deal with various sanctions separately. In addition, the general public has not completely given up hope of achieving a peaceful resolution within the scope of Geneva, believing that if the League of Nations can, according to Article 12 of the Covenant, allow a portion of Abyssinian territory to be placed under Italian mandate, there is still room for a turnaround in the situation.

<p>Warsaw A semi-official source here declared, "Poland does not wish to evade the implementation of sanctions against Italy in accordance with the resolutions of the League of Nations. The League has decided yesterday to prohibit loans to Italy. This move, in terms of the relationship between Poland and Italy, can be said to be completely irrelevant, because currently, due to Italy's difficulty in paying for goods exported from Poland, the exchange between the two countries is greatly restricted, and the Italian-Polish trade agreement has not yet been signed due to Italy's currency difficulties. Under these circumstances, Poland has no possibility of lending to Italy. As for the economic sanctions, they will naturally affect Poland's exports to Italy. Poland will not refuse to participate in the sanctions, but will demand reasonable compensation from other members of the League of Nations, especially regarding coal, because in 1934, Poland's total coal exports amounted to 9,880,000 tons, and exports to Italy accounted for as much as 1,700,000 tons."

<p>(Paris) After meeting with senior officials here, US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau is quite pessimistic about the future of international monetary stabilization. According to the Bank of France, the US Treasury Secretary held private meetings with French Prime Minister Laval and Bank of France Governor Tannery. Morgenthau is said to be dispelling the impression that he is currently undermining any currency stabilization plan. Bankers are convinced that the implementation of sanctions against Italy will cause turmoil in the economic world and will cause the world to stagnate in a state of depression for a long time. Morgenthau had lunch with the Governor of the French Bank today. After the meal, Morgenthau declared that the war debt issue was not mentioned in the talks. The Treasury Department does not attach importance to the inflow of gold into the United States, because so far the gold shipped to the United States has been done by individuals, and no national banks of European countries have participated in it. Regarding the issue of currency stabilization, Morgenthau only said that if European countries are willing to discuss it, the United States is always happy to comply.

<p>(Geneva) Abyssinian representative to France, Minister Haile Wold, recently met with a Havas News Agency reporter and gave an interview. The reporter asked if there was any possibility of negotiations between Italy and Abyssinia at present. Haile Wold replied, "Unless the Italian troops withdraw from Abyssinian territory, there is no possibility of negotiations between Italy and Abyssinia. We must wait until Italy completely returns the territories it has invaded before any negotiations can be carried out." Haile Wold also said, "Our country also has frequent border disputes with the East African territories of Britain and France, but they are always resolved amicably, because Britain and France have always adopted a tolerant attitude, which is not the case with Italy. Now that Italy and Abyssinia have been involved in war, no matter how difficult it is at present, Abyssinia will do its best to resist in order to achieve final victory. If necessary, Abyssinia will not hesitate to resist for twelve to fifteen years. On the other hand, Italy has launched a long and arduous expedition, and it will be difficult to maintain for a long time in the sweltering climate unsuitable for Europeans.

<p>(Rome) According to intelligence obtained from here, the situation on the East African front is roughly as follows: (1) The Abyssinian army has begun a counterattack, and both flanks of the Italian army are under threat, especially the Italian army on the right flank near the city of Axum. (2) The Abyssinian army is conducting local attacks along the Setit River in many places on the border between Axum and British-Egyptian Sudan, but all have been repelled by the Italian army. The main force of the Italian army did not participate in the battle, but only soldiers were commanded by military adjutants to respond to the battle. (3) Residents of the Gojjam Province (in northwestern Abyssinia) are now reported to be disobeying orders from the Abyssinian central government. This move is sufficient to undermine the Emperor's authority to control the army. The former governor of the province, Nairu, has been detained since 1933. The current governor is Gemilu, but the people still loyal to the former governor. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)</p>

<p>Tax Police Captain Killed While Escorting Prisoners</p>
<p>The First District Unit of the Zhapu Tax Police stationed a sub-unit in the Hongni Town area to carry out patrols. On the night of the thirteenth, they arrested five smugglers in the Hongshu Township area, along with five loads of illegal salt. The smugglers spoke with a northern accent. The salt was all stored in flour sacks. They were immediately escorted to the sub-unit, where the sub-unit captain, Gu Huafang, questioned them briefly and ordered them to be detained. Sub-unit captain Gu was only 21 years old. He had been transferred from another location and had only been on duty for three days. He was not aware of the interests of the local salt smugglers. After the arrest, he was overjoyed. At 1:00 AM on the fourteenth, he led five police officers and prepared a document to escort the prisoners to Zhapu, ordering each of the smugglers to carry their original loads. When they reached Yangshu Jing Bridge, he ordered four of the police officers to return to the station, leaving only one, Ruan Youcheng, armed with a gun, to follow behind. Gu was carrying a short gun and led the way in the dim moonlight. Around 2:00 AM, they reached Daimudun, a desolate area with few houses, and it was late at night. The salt smugglers each pulled out shoulder poles and attacked Gu and Ruan. Because they were outnumbered, they were both killed. At dawn, the Second Sub-Bureau of the Zhapu Public Security Bureau received a telegram from Han Bingsheng, the Bao Chief of the Thirty-Second Bao, and learned of the tragedy. They immediately telegraphed the county government and requested an inspection. At 9:00 AM, Zhu, an investigator from the county government, accompanied by a coroner, went to the scene by car. Wang Hongqi, the district chief of the First District of the Tax Police, was also in the city on official business and went with Zhu. It was found that Gu Yuanfang's left eye was struck by a shoulder pole, disappearing without a trace. His skull was shattered. His right hand was clenched, and his left foot was straight, indicating that he had fought before his death. Ruan Youcheng had more than eight shoulder pole injuries. Both bodies were covered in blood and unrecognizable, a terrible sight to behold. One gun was looted, and the other was broken. The five loads of illegal salt, except for the scattered ones, were still carried away by the smugglers. It is not known where they went. It is said that the last time a civilian killed an official was during the Guangxu Guimao year, when Yu Sanqiang killed Deputy City Chief Shen. This is the second time.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Foreign Ships and Domestic Goods Cannot Reach Italy <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>American and Italian Businesses Jointly Establish an Insurance Company</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Italo-Ethiopian War, the League of Nations has implemented economic sanctions against Italy. There have been major changes in shipping routes between the Far East and Europe. This is worth documenting, so it is presented below in detail.</p>
<p>Dutch Ships Stop Going to Italy</p>
<p>The Dutch East Asia Shipping Company operates a liner service between Shanghai and Europe, with one ship sailing each month. The route is from Shanghai to Rotterdam, Netherlands, passing through the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean Sea, arriving in Genoa, Italy, and then proceeding to Germany and the Netherlands. Now, due to the Italo-Ethiopian War, merchant ships sailing in the Mediterranean Sea must increase war risk insurance. Those residing in Italy are charged even more. The Dutch East Asia Company believes that, since the League of Nations has resolved to impose economic sanctions on Italy, the volume of goods shipped to Italy from the Far East will inevitably decrease significantly. The company's Sino-Dutch liners have been decided by the head office to change the route. They have telegraphed the Shanghai office, stating that ships returning to Europe from Shanghai will generally refuse to load goods destined for Italy and instruct ships not to go to Italian ports to transport goods to Germany and the Netherlands. The company has already complied.</p>
<p>German Mail Ships Change Ports</p>
<p>The starting point in the Far East for the North German Company's newly built three express mail ships is Shanghai. The most important port in Europe is Genoa. Therefore, the 23-day sea voyage of the three ships refers to the journey from Shanghai to the port of Genoa. Passengers in Shanghai who take the North German express mail ships mostly have tickets to Italy. They transfer by train from Genoa to various countries on the European continent. Unexpectedly, the situation in the Italo-Ethiopian War is changing rapidly, and the Far East shipping has been greatly affected. In order to avoid disputes and risks, postal ships from various countries have stopped going to Italy. The North German Company has also sent a telegram to Shanghai, changing the route of the Central Europe three express liners. After departing from Shanghai, they will no longer go to the Italian ports of Genoa or Naples, but will instead go to Marseille, France, as the first port of call. Passengers will transfer by train in France. The ship Taitalia, Tkier, departing on the 19th of this month, and the ship Xianghuositelun, departing on the 14th of next month, will no longer go to Italy but will go directly to France. Even cargo ships on the Central Europe route will not go to Italy.</p>
<p>Chinese Goods Shipped to Italy Decrease Significantly</p>
<p>Currently, commercial ships from Britain and France have stopped shipping goods to Italy. This move has affected the Far East's trade with Europe. In the past, sesame was the main export to Italy. Exports had stagnated for many years, but started to recover this year. A large shipment of sesame was being prepared, but recently, due to the war, Chinese sesame exports to Italy have decreased significantly. A reporter made a special investigation and learned that after the outbreak of the Italo-Ethiopian War, sesame exports to Italy had been halted, and exports had decreased significantly. The number of other exports to Italy, such as raw peanuts, has also been minimal. Those who handle goods have stopped handling them and have ceased to continue shipping them.</p>
<p>War Risk Insurance Problem Solved</p>
<p>Goods shipped to Europe that pass through the Mediterranean Sea and the Suez Canal must all be insured for war risk. Those shipped to Italy must also be insured for war risk, or the shipping companies will not dare to load them. Insurance companies in Britain, France, and other countries have refused to insure goods going to Italy. Now, an insurance company has been established in this port by a joint venture between American and Italian businesses. It specializes in insuring goods shipped to Italy. An office has been set up on Guangdong Road and has already started providing insurance. Therefore, the war risk insurance problem for goods shipped to Italy has been solved.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Bank of China: New Bills Exchanged for Old; Bank's Issuance Volume Decreases This Year <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai, 16th (Reuters) - A Reuters reporter visited Mr. C. Tai, the Secretary-General of the Bank of China, this morning to inquire about rumors that the Bank of China was printing more new banknotes. Mr. Tai replied that the new banknotes in question were printed in April of this year and were simply a routine measure to replace worn and damaged banknotes. The reporter also inquired whether the Bank of China intended to expand the circulation of banknotes. The Secretary-General replied that the amount of banknote circulation depended solely on commercial demand. The total amount of banknotes issued by the Bank of China was available for public inspection. According to the existing figures, the amount of banknotes issued this year was lower than last year and 1933 due to limited commercial demand.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Repair of Jiangnan Seawall: Entire Project to Be Completed Next Month <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>According to the National News Agency, the Jiangnan Seawall project suffered slight damage during the typhoons in July and August of this year. The Jiangsu Provincial Government, recognizing that the Jiangnan Seawall was a safeguard for the lives and property of the people of Jiangnan, deemed it urgent to repair it. Therefore, it allocated 100,000 yuan in August of this year as repair funds and established the Jiangnan Seawall Engineering Office in Binshan under the Jiangsu Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau, appointing Mr. Liu Yeqiu as director. It is now known that the Jiangnan Seawall project has been under construction, with stone work as the main focus. Laborers are hired through a contract system. According to the office, the repair work this year focuses on the four counties of Baoshan, Changshu, Songjiang, and Taicang. Moreover, since major repairs were carried out last year, the repairs this year are relatively easier. The project is now largely completed and is expected to be fully completed by the end of next month.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Liu Zhongying Writes to the Taxpayers' Association, Suggesting the Municipal Council <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Not to Disregard the Livelihoods of Lower-Level Civil Servants in the Name of Accepting Austerity Measures</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Mr. Liu Zhongying, the Executive Committee Member of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Shanghai Concession, sent a letter to the association yesterday, which stated: "Dear Sirs, since Mr. Xu Xiaochu and other executive committee members of this association have suggested that due to the economic downturn, which has affected the tax revenue of the Shanghai Municipal Council in the Public Concession, that measures should be taken to reduce expenses in advance to ease the burden on the citizens, the news has spread and received widespread support. This clearly indicates that since Shanghai was drawn into the vortex of the global economic recession, the economy has been depressed, and commerce has declined, which is beyond doubt. Recently, there have been frequent reports of old shops, claiming to have been established for decades, declaring bankruptcy and liquidation due to difficulties in maintaining business. Furthermore, companies and firms with considerable history, in order to struggle for survival, are attempting to survive by cutting expenses, laying off employees, and reducing salaries, or are being closed down by the court for failing to pay overdue rent due to high rents, which are too numerous to count. In this extremely panic-stricken market, shops that are still operating feel precarious. However, it is found that the recurring expenses of the Municipal Council rely entirely on the land and house taxes paid by merchants and residents within the concession as the main source. According to the Council's revenue budget for 1935, it is over 11.8 million yuan, and comparing it with the actual collection for the first half of 1935 (January to June), it is already short by 260,000 yuan. If considering the entire year, it is self-evident that the revenue from taxes will decrease due to the economic downturn, shop closures, and resident migrations, resulting in vacant houses. However, examining the expenses within the administrative scope of the Municipal Council, foreign staff, in addition to receiving huge salaries, also receive subsidies for expenses such as rent and education. Their comfortable living is several times higher than that of administrative offices in the vast domestic regions. Even the music band, which citizens believe should be abolished, has spent over 125,000 yuan in the first half of this year, while the education expenses for the Chinese population, who account for nine-tenths of the concession's population, are less than 5%. This sufficiently proves that the Council's bias towards one side and its failure to manage expenses properly are undeniable. However, it has recently been heard that after Mr. Xu Xiaochu and other members of this association suggested reducing expenses, the Council has adopted an attitude of having to accept this austerity measure. If necessary, the living expenses of lower-level detectives and other staff have already been reduced. For example, each detective used to receive a monthly salary of 23 to 25 yuan and a transportation allowance of 12 yuan. Now, the transportation allowance has been cancelled to show austerity. However, there has been no reduction in the original salaries of the foreign staff who waste large amounts of money on the music band. This kind of action, which protects one side and conceals the opinions of others, is truly inappropriate for the Council and disheartening for us Chinese taxpayers. In my opinion, the minimum living expenses for each person in Shanghai are no less than 30 to 40 yuan per day. Now, detectives and others rely entirely on this income to cover their expenses. Once it is reduced, their stimulation will be profound, and the unforeseen events that residents within our concession will suffer will also be expected. Now, the Municipal Council disregards the livelihoods of lower-level civil servants and specializes in protecting the interests of foreign staff within its sphere of influence. We Chinese taxpayers find it difficult to remain silent. Therefore, I urge your association to suggest to the Municipal Council that in this situation where the shadow of the economic downturn pervades all of Shanghai, in addition to cutting unnecessary and wasteful expenses and reducing the salaries of foreign staff who receive huge salaries, for lower-level civil servants who rely entirely on the lowest salary to maintain their lives, do not achieve the opposite result in the name of austerity, because the meager income is not as large as the huge expenditure of a single music band unit under the Council's annual budget."</p>
<h3 id="e107">Impoverished Opium Smokers in the Concession Area to Be Allowed to Register by Alternate Means <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Those Who Know Each Other May Act as Mutual Guarantors; Registration Will Also Be Permitted Even if No Guarantor Can Be Found</p>
<p>According to the Ta Kung Pao, in order to expand anti-smoking publicity and urge opium smokers to register voluntarily within the extended registration period, the Municipal Police Bureau and the Anti-Smoking Committee have dispatched more than ten investigators to cooperate with the police stations in each district. They have been divided into five groups and have been holding open-air speeches along the streets in the southern and northern districts of Shanghai since yesterday morning to explain the meaning of registration. The audience is extremely crowded. Dai Lizhen, the director of the Opium Smoker Registration Section of the Police Bureau, has also prepared ordinary measures to facilitate the registration of impoverished opium smokers in the concession area who have no guarantor and will submit them to the bureau chief for approval and implementation. The proposed measures are recorded below: Since the extension of the deadline for voluntary registration, the bureau's persuasion work has been extremely intense, and the number of registered opium smokers has gradually increased. Currently, only a small number of opium smokers residing in this city have been identified by the bureau as not having registered. Since the Shanghai Municipal Government and the concession authorities negotiated that all opium offenders found in the special zone would first be sent to the city's drug rehabilitation hospital for 20 days of abstinence, and then sent back to the court for execution after the term, opium smokers residing in the concession are in constant fear and are very willing for the bureau to handle the matter flexibly and allow them to voluntarily come to register. It is now found that most of the opium smokers under the jurisdiction of the Laobeimen Police Station are those who reside in the concession and come to this city to smoke opium, and another part are impoverished opium smokers who are constantly moving and unable to find a guarantor, and have not registered according to the regulations. The total number is estimated to be about four or five thousand people. If the deadline for compulsory registration is reached and they are all arrested, opium smokers will have to be subject to legal sanctions, and the bureau will not be able to accommodate them, which will also increase the difficulty of handling the matter. It is now planned to eliminate registration obstacles within these two weeks and find ways to register all the aforementioned omitted opium smokers. The bureau will dispatch all investigators to cooperate with the competent Laobeimen Police Station, and the police will be assigned to carry out segmented investigation and persuasion work. If the police force is insufficient, the bureau chief will be requested to assign a police company, and all officers and police will assist in the handling. The goal of this investigation and persuasion is to persuade all opium smokers to register. Those who reside in the concession should be ordered to leave a correspondence address in this city and register according to the regulations. Impoverished opium smokers should be allowed to have those who know each other act as mutual guarantors. Those who voluntarily want to quit smoking should also be allowed to register even if they cannot find a guarantor. First, they should fill out an application form, then affix their fingerprints, and issue a receipt for release. The application form and fingerprint paper will be submitted to the bureau for future transmission to the drug rehabilitation hospital for treatment. All investigators and police should carry application forms, guarantee forms, and various publicity materials, and investigate opium smokers at any time and handle registration procedures at any time. Those who still stubbornly resist after a long period of persuasion should be sent to the police station to be forcibly registered. By doing so, registration can be popularized. If other branch bureaus have omitted opium smokers, they should also follow the aforementioned methods and actively handle them to achieve quick results.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Explains: Donation Books of Charitable Organizations Are Exempt from Stamp Duty; Receipts Should Be Affixed Accordingly <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce replied to the Guangdong Hospital Fundraising Committee yesterday: "We received your letter of the 15th of this month, requesting us to clarify whether donation books, donation registers, formal receipts, and temporary receipts used by charitable organizations, as stipulated in Article 3, Section 6 of the Stamp Tax Law, which stipulates that account books used by charitable organizations are exempt from stamp duty, should be affixed with stamps. We will answer as follows: (1) Article 3 of the Stamp Tax Law stipulates that all items exempted from tax that use the term 'certificates' in general refer to all types of certificates, which can be exempted from stamping, and the scope is broader, such as Sections 1 and 3 of the article. Those that specifically indicate one type that can be exempted from stamping naturally cannot extend to other types in addition to the specified one. Section 5 of the article stipulates that account books used by individuals or families are exempt from stamping, and Section 6 stipulates that account books used by educational, cultural, or charitable organizations are exempt from stamping. The scope of exemption for Sections 5 and 6 is the same, limited to account books only, and naturally cannot extend to matters not stipulated for exemption in the law. According to this standard, donation receipts are cash receipts, and all amounts of 3 yuan or more should be affixed with stamps according to the tax rate. However, if a temporary receipt is issued first, and a formal receipt needs to be issued later, it can be stated in the temporary receipt that it will be exchanged for a formal receipt with stamps affixed to avoid misunderstanding. The reason is that the same type of certificate cannot be required to be stamped twice according to the law, and the temporary certificate issued does not need to be stamped. The temporary receipt in Section 14 of the tax rate table and the temporary share subscription receipt in Section 17 can be compared. (3) Article 1 of the Stamp Tax Law states that all types of certificates stipulated in this law should pay stamp tax in accordance with this law. In other words, certificates not stipulated in this law do not need to be affixed with stamp tax. The nature of the donation register can be used to collect money from people, but whether to donate or not is purely at the discretion of the donor and is different from a voucher for collecting money, which the other party has an obligation to pay. Therefore, the donation register can never be compared to a book for drawing money. In addition to this, there are no identical or similar provisions, and it can be exempted from stamping according to the law."</p>
<h3 id="e115">Shipping Merchants Request Amendment to Stamp Tax Law; Three Representatives Go to Nanjing Today; Also Request Revision of Maritime Law <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>All shipping merchants in Shanghai strongly opposed the new stamp tax regulations promulgated by the central government in September, which required each bill of lading to be affixed with a stamp worth 20 cents. The minimum amount for a bill of lading is only 50 cents. If a stamp tax of 20 cents is paid, how can the shipping companies sustain themselves? Therefore, it was proposed to the Shipping Association to discuss remedies, and the association submitted a request to the Legislative Yuan for review. Later, the Shipping Association received a reply from the Legislative Yuan stating that it had been submitted to the Finance Group of the Legislative Yuan and that the revision would be reviewed on the 18th of this month, and ordered the Shipping Association to send representatives to Nanjing to attend the meeting in order to consult opinions. The Association also found that there were still points in the Maritime Law that needed to be revised, and that the Maritime Court needed to have maritime experts participate in order to be impartial. Therefore, the results of the discussion at yesterday's executive meeting were that the Association elected representatives Yuan Ludeng, Wei Wenhan, and Wang Zigang to go to Nanjing today to attend the financial meeting of the Legislative Yuan to discuss the revision of the Stamp Tax Law and to present requests for revision of the Maritime Law.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Fundraising All-Province Water Disaster Relief Association received a letter yesterday from Cheng Yiqing, the Jiangsu Investigation and Relief Director, forwarded by Du Yuncheng, a disaster investigation committee member, stating, "Respectfully informing you, recently received a letter from Mr. Du Yuncheng, a disaster investigation committee member from this office, stating that he was instructed by your office's investigation telegram last month to immediately go to Su, Shuyang, and other counties to investigate the disaster and submit a report. He proceeded to Su County on the 1st of this month, arriving on the 2nd. The next morning, together with County Magistrate Zhang Naifan, he went from Xiguan along the west embankment to Zaohe, then crossed the river eastward and northward to the Wan Zhen area for inspection. Only Huangdun Lake and the Canal embankment overflowed, forming a single body, submerging over ten villages, resulting in a localized disaster that was not extremely urgent. County Magistrate Zhang supervised the civilians to repair the damaged embankments. That evening, they stayed at the Zhen Shang Inn. Unexpectedly, at around 10 PM, the Yihe River's southern embankment north of the town suddenly burst. The sound of the rushing water was deafening, like a mountain collapsing and breaking. The clamor of human voices resembled ten thousand horses galloping. It was followed by parents calling for their children and children crying for their parents, turning into mournful wails, their voices hoarse and exhausted. At that time, it was deep night and pitch black, making it impossible to distinguish east from west. The water flow was turbulent, and rescue boats could not sail upstream. County Magistrate Zhang and Yuncheng embraced each other in sorrow, unable to do anything. At four o'clock in the morning, Yuncheng established a reward system for saving lives, arbitrarily subsidizing 500 yuan on behalf of your office. County Magistrate Zhang explained that for each life saved from the water, a reward of five yuan would be given. As a result, more and more people were rescued. By noon, 163 people had been saved, their bodies soaked and their faces pale. They were then given artificial respiration and warm soup, and fortunately, all were saved. However, looking at the vast land, it was an ocean in all directions, with corpses floating, and even chickens and dogs were not spared. Over seventy people were seen drowning who could not be rescued because they could not reach the high mounds and treetops. The number of those not yet discovered has not been tallied. Several thousand disaster victims gathered on the upper and lower dikes of the town, crying for food. Most of their stored grain had been washed away, and their homes were gone. It is essential to provide urgent relief. Temporary shelters have already been arranged. The breach is approximately ten yards wide, and the water flow is extremely fierce, directly pouring into Luoma Lake. As a result, the areas around Maling Mountain and the eastern embankment of the Canal have become a waterlogged land, with a depth of about two zhang in some places. In total, the number of disaster victims in Suqian County awaiting relief is no less than 50,000. Moreover, Luoma Lake is located downstream of the Su River breach, and the nearby Second, Third, and Eighth districts are likely to continue to be submerged. This is the disaster situation in Suqian. On the 5th, they went to Shuyang, where the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth districts were affected. In total, there are approximately 47,000 to 48,000 disaster victims. Among the affected areas, the Liutang River burst, pouring into the Zhangjiayuan, Machang, and Qianshiji areas in the southeast. At the same time, the Chai Mi Wan Gong Liang rivers also overflowed. Currently, officials and civilians are desperately reinforcing the northern embankment of the Chai Mi Wan Gong Liang rivers and the Central Canal throughout the night. If they burst again, the entire county will be submerged. The disaster situation will not be limited to this. The expansion of the disaster in Suqian, endangering the Shuyang dikes, is indeed extremely serious. Among the disaster areas in this province, Xuzhou's Pi County has the most extensive area and the most disaster victims. However, Yao Wan in Suqian is the most in need of food and has the most tragic disaster situation, which is unique and cannot wait until winter for relief. In addition to the 2,000 yuan telegraphed by this association, along with the county government, for lifesaving and rescue efforts, the Jiangsu Provincial Water Disaster Relief General Association has appointed Committee Member Du as the temporary emergency relief director and allocated an additional 6,000 yuan to carry out temporary emergency relief. As for Shuyang and the East China Sea areas, the Provincial Relief General Association has also allocated funds for lifesaving and rescue efforts. Meanwhile, Mr. Xiao Qingqing of the Xiaohui Society in Beiping has been employed to go to Zhenji with 10,000 yuan. In a blink of an eye, it will be cold. The eight counties of Pi, Tong, Pei, Feng, Su, Mo, Hai, and Guan all need to raise funds for relief. The disaster area is vast, and the relief funds are meager, which is already challenging. However, the Liutang River in Lianshui has burst again, causing a disaster. Considering the number of disaster victims in various counties in the province, it is feared that it has reached 1.6 to 1.7 million. Moreover, the Yellow River is flowing eastward without end, and there is no way to stop it. Chairman Chen, Directors Yu and Shen, and other directors are deeply concerned about the people and are working day and night to prevent and provide relief, sparing no effort. However, the strength of officials and civilians is limited, and disasters continue to occur. If this continues to flood, half of the country will be flooded, which will be extremely cruel and unprecedented. Other provinces have already passed the peak of the crisis, but the people of Jiangsu are experiencing an even more dire situation. Therefore, we urgently appeal to the General Assembly to show compassion and hold an emergency meeting to allocate 500,000 to 600,000 yuan in advance to carry out emergency winter relief to save these survivors. As for reversing the tide and implementing effective fundamental solutions, Mr. Han Zhishi, Leng Yuqiu, and other local scholars, along with new and old water conservancy experts in the province, have developed practical plans that require no less than six to seven million yuan. Coupled with the loss of hope for spring wheat and the need for relief work, a total of ten million yuan is needed. In short, to preserve our nation and consolidate the capital region, seven to eight million yuan is the minimum required. However, the people's wealth has been exhausted, and the provincial treasury is empty. It is hoped that the government will issue funds to show benevolence, which is what the people desire. We also propose to telegraph the central government to urgently allocate 8 million yuan in relief funds, in addition to raising funds to plug the breach, in order to provide work as relief, drain the water, and implement emergency spring relief and agricultural relief, addressing both the symptoms and the root causes. The overall benefit will be great. With tears in our eyes, we await your favorable response."</p>

<h3 id="e120">County Fifth District Urges Land Registration <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Registration Deadline Extended to One Month Starting October 21st</p>
<p>Since the Fifth District of Shanghai County has been handling land registration, there have been many errors found during surveying. Those who have requested corrections have been repeatedly asked to resubmit and pay fees, causing unbearable additional losses to the public. Many people are taking a wait-and-see attitude and have not registered. Therefore, the District Chief Xing Zhigang has requested the County Land Bureau to reduce the resubmission fees for surveying to alleviate the burden on poor farmers. He also urges the residents of Chenhang, Tangkou, and Tiqiao townships, stating: "This land registration involves significant property rights for the public. Previously, the provincial bureau set the urging period from September 20th to October 20th. Now that the urging period has ended, if you continue to delay and wait, once the registration is closed, you will inevitably lose your property rights and regret it too late. It is now decided that from October 21st, the post-registration announcement period will begin, with a deadline of one month. If any errors are found, please submit proof documents and request objections for corrections. Do not neglect this to protect your property rights."</p>

<h3 id="e122">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Plans to Improve Business on the Four New Ships <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Yuanheng Lizhen Four New Ships of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which sail between Hong Kong and Guangdong, are essential to the company's lifeline. Therefore, efforts are constantly made to rectify and improve them. The business and shipbuilding departments often send personnel on board to conduct on-site inspections to improve them. Recently, the general affairs, business, and shipbuilding departments consulted on seventeen reform measures for the Four New Ships, which were issued to each ship yesterday for review and implementation. The original document is as follows: (1) The chief mate, second mate, and purser should supervise the steward to ensure that the food for the passengers is handled properly. (2) Cooks and waiters often sleep soundly and naked on the decks of first-class cabins when it is hot, which is unsightly. The chief mate and second mate should strictly prohibit this. (3) Service staff are often very lazy, and the purser and assistant do not strictly manage them, resulting in messy dishes and even gathering on sofas to chat or nap. The purser should be responsible for strictly prohibiting this. (4) Service staff are not allowed to eat in the main dining room. (5) Entertainment equipment should be placed in the account room and only taken out when guests need entertainment. (6) Haiyuan previously hired an extra hand to wash bowls, which is similar to the "cold water class" system and should be immediately prohibited. (7) After the ship arrives at the port, canvas beds and chairs are placed everywhere, often resulting in loss and damage. The captain, together with the purser, should inspect the ship after it arrives at the port and supervise the service staff to handle them properly. (8) Service staff are not allowed to go ashore after arriving at the port without the purser's permission. If they need to go ashore, they should hand over the keys to the purser and notify the purser of their return time. Those who are late will be considered tardy. The purser should be responsible for supervising all the staff on the ship. (9) Responsible personnel in each department should strictly prohibit the sale of berths. (10) Food should not be placed in the luggage room, and luggage should not be placed in the walkways. (11) The floors of the third-class cabins must be washed clean with water by the service staff after arriving at the port. (12) The first and second-class cabins are not very clean. The purser should effectively lead the service staff to carry out cleaning work. (13) Service staff's wake-up time in the morning is 6 AM in autumn and winter and 5 AM in spring and summer. They are not allowed to sleep late. The purser should inspect to see if anyone is sleeping late at that time. The time for service staff to get up when the ship arrives at the port is determined by the purser. (14) The purser should re-determine the shifts for service staff, with four people per shift. There must also be four people on duty at night, and they should be inspected at any time to prevent them from sleeping. (15) Service staff on the ship should wear uniforms. Those who wear casual clothes will be considered absent from work. (16) The captain, purser, and steward should inspect the passenger areas of the entire ship every day at 11 AM, fill out a report, and send it to the bureau. (17) The captain, purser, and steward should convene service staff and waiters at any time for training, and provide instructions on improving their work.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Tenth Regular Meeting of the Anti-Smoking Association and Visit to the Shanghai North Drug Rehabilitation Hospital <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the Shanghai Anti-Smoking Committee's deadline for voluntary registration of smokers in the city will expire at the end of this month. From next month, forced registration will begin. Fearing that smokers do not understand the details and are hesitant, various publicity materials have been drafted, and lecturers have been assigned to form a propaganda team with the Municipal Public Security Bureau to set off in the city and Zhabei 　Dong Gaoqiao area to publicize and lecture, so that smokers can understand the meaning of registration and enthusiastically go to the Public Security Bureau to register. In addition, the committee visited the Shanghai North Drug Rehabilitation Hospital on Tiantong'an Road, Zhabei, at the invitation of Li Qian'an, Director of the Municipal Health Bureau, to inspect the hospital's internal facilities. They also held a meeting in the hospital's conference room. Committee members Shi Xiaolai, Chu Qiaolian, Wang Yiting, Wang Boqi, Du Yuesheng, and the association's secretary Gui Yuhua, Cai Bubai, section chief Lin, and Wang Yu attended. Director Li, Section Chief Shen, and Dean Mei received them and guided them to visit the first, second, and third wards, explaining the methods and procedures of treatment in detail. The wards were well-ventilated, and the food for the smokers was also very sanitary. It is said that smokers who quit and are discharged from the hospital gain an average of five hours in weight. In addition, each room is equipped with a radio to regulate the smokers' minds and bodies so they will not feel lonely. Outside the wards, there are gardens 　 corners for smokers to do light exercise. The committee members praised the hospital's thorough facilities. They then went to the conference room, where they were offered tea and refreshments. Director Li delivered a speech, saying, "I am very honored to have the opportunity to invite everyone here today to visit. Everyone has expertise in the anti-smoking industry, and I hope you will not hesitate to give us your advice. If there is an opportunity in the future, we would like to gather together again to discuss the progress of anti-smoking efforts." Committee member Yan Fuqing then stood up to give a thank-you speech. This was followed by the tenth regular meeting. The attendees were committee members Yan Fuqing, Zai Boqi, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng (Xiaodai), Chu Qiaoqing, Wang Yiting, and the attendees were Li Tingan, Shen Gao, Mei Zhuosheng, Gui Yuhua, Wang Yu, and Lin Fu. Chairman Yan Fuqing, and recorder Cai Bubai A. Report Items: (1) Reading the resolutions of the previous session, (2) Reporting the work progress. B. Discussion Items: (1) Yan Fuqing proposed that the Municipal Government be requested to transfer the association and the Health Bureau to designate concurrent drug rehabilitation hospitals, so that smokers can voluntarily receive treatment and avoid顾已 cases. The reason attached: This city has allocated funds to establish four free treatment hospitals for drug rehabilitation, which is enough to give smokers a way to reform themselves. However, those who go to receive treatment must first register with the Public Security Bureau, and upon arrival at the hospital, they must have their photos taken and fingerprints taken. To quit addiction, they must also fill out a statement of quitting at the Public Security Bureau. Although the above procedures are for examination and verification, those who have addictions are still hesitant to go forward during the period when forced smoking cessation has not yet been implemented. Those with better financial conditions are even more reluctant to accept future restrictions. At the same time, they are also afraid of seeking medical treatment for smoking cessation, which is too expensive, and the method of smoking cessation is not appropriate. It seems to have an impact on the future of smoking cessation. It is feared that the number of people who voluntarily quit smoking at the moment will decrease because of this. When forced smoking cessation comes, the number of people will be too large. Moreover, the situation in Shanghai is special. Some smokers live in special zones. In order to encourage treatment, it is proposed that this association suggest to the Municipal Government, based on the provisions of Article 4 of the Organizational Regulations, that the Municipal Government consult with the Health Bureau and designate several formal hospitals to concurrently handle smoking cessation, with the government subsidizing a portion of the costs and sending personnel to supervise the hospitals from time to time. The procedures for admission and discharge should generally follow the hospital's regulations, and there is no need to go through the registration, photography, fingerprinting, and signing procedures to avoid hesitation. As for the examination method, the smoking cessation hospital can submit a list of the names, genders, ages, occupations, detailed addresses, admission and discharge dates, and names of doctors who have or have not quit to the Public Security Bureau and this association for compilation and examination on a monthly basis. Whether or not it is appropriate, I hope that a public resolution will be made. (Resolution) Passed. The two municipal governments are requested to check and handle it. Adjourned.</p>

<p>Director Cai of the Municipal Public Security Bureau believes that the Public Security Bureau is responsible for maintaining public order throughout the city. To consolidate the city's security, special attention must be paid to the training of senior police officers. Therefore, he has specifically stipulated that training senior police officers is one of the four major tasks of the Public Security Bureau. Training instructors in each sub-bureau and police station are responsible for the actual training. Police chiefs and police officers must all receive training. The General Bureau will send Dong Xianfu to inspect from time to time, and explain the main points of the Public Security Bureau's four major tasks to the police chiefs to implement the purpose of training lower-level cadres and prevent administrative separation between the Public Security Bureau's upper and lower levels. With good lower-level cadres, the police service can be improved under supervision and guidance, and the original intention of training the police can be achieved. It is reported that the bureau is determined to thoroughly implement the training of senior police officers. It is absolutely not allowed to delay, perfunctorily, or neglect the duty. Therefore, only training instructors in each sub-bureau and police station are currently ordered to actively work, and the deadline has not yet been specified.</p>

When abroad, he had the opportunity to read newspapers from his motherland and felt that the newspaper industry in our country has also made rapid progress in recent years. However, in order to accelerate the advancement of the current stage of the Chinese news industry, our colleagues still need to make continuous efforts.

<p>The Datong News Agency reports that yesterday, another shop declared liquidation: (1) Yu Da Xie Ji Sauce Garden, located at 732 Huade Road in this city, has been in business for over a decade. The shop owners are Chen Xuanxuan and Chen Jingping, brothers from Nanhui. Yu Da Zhen Sauce Garden on Yinxiang East Street and Yangjia Bing Wan Yu Sauce Garden on Ma Yushan Road are its branches. In addition, Yu Da Zhan (located at the bridgehead of Huade Road and Linqing Road) serves as the main warehouse for the three branches, occupying a large area. Due to sluggish market conditions and inflexible capital turnover, it owes more than 100,000 yuan, making it impossible to maintain operations. Lawyer Yang Li has been entrusted to declare liquidation. (2) The Da Du Hui Shoe Store at 198 Guangxi Road, known for its high-quality women's shoes, holds a prominent position among women's shoe businesses in the Xiaohuayuan area. Recently, affected by market conditions and slow business, the shop owner, Zhang Baokui, has entrusted lawyer Shen Jue to represent the liquidation. Creditors and debtors must register or settle their claims with lawyer Shen's office within fourteen days.

<h3 id="e137">Taxpayers' Association Requests the Municipal Council to Respect Laws and Regulations and Not to Favor Li Quewei <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Municipal Council Employees Dare to Disobey Regulations, and it is Difficult to Punish Public Buses for Repeated Accidents</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "We are writing to inform you that we have received a joint letter from twenty-two citizens, including Zhu Shaohao, Wu Chuncai, and Luo Binqiu, stating that they read in the newspaper that a shocking car accident occurred at the entrance of the Hankou Road Stock Exchange at around 1:00 PM on the 8th of this month. The victim, Mr. Li Chuanbin, was on the sidewalk and was killed by a car driven by Li Quewei, a Westerner from the Municipal Council, who recklessly drove onto the sidewalk. This is a great tragedy. After learning about this, we were all shocked and extremely disturbed. Therefore, we are writing to you to request that the Municipal Council negotiate with reason and severely punish the Western employee who caused the accident, so as to ensure that other Western drivers will not dare to commit similar tragedies in the future, to appease public anger and protect the safety of pedestrians. We were processing this matter when we received a letter from Mr. Li Chuansi, the brother of the deceased, stating, "My younger brother, Chuanbin, a native of Wuxian, was 23 years old and worked as a wireless telegraph operator for the Shanghai branch of the Central News Agency. At 1:55 PM on the 8th of this month, he was walking east on the south sidewalk of Hankou Road from his dormitory at Tongan Lane to the news agency office in the Continental Mansion. Unexpectedly, when he reached the door of 421 Fuyong Silk Store (next to the Shanghai Hotel) on that road, Li Quewei C.H. Ridgway, an inspector from the Municipal Council's Revenue Office, drove a concession-plated car No. 8497 eastward without following traffic regulations, driving onto the south sidewalk and knocking my brother down from behind, breaking his leg bones, injuring his internal organs, and destroying the window sill of Fuyong Store. My brother only cried out for help once before losing consciousness. The Fuyong Store called the police and the Red Cross Society sent an ambulance to the scene for emergency treatment. He was taken to Renji Hospital, but died of his injuries. I received the news and rushed to Shanghai overnight, but my brother's body was already at the Forensic Examination Office on Helun Road. At 10:00 AM on the 9th, Judge Pei from the Shanghai First Special District Court questioned the Westerner Li Quewei, who admitted the circumstances of the accident, but falsely claimed that the accident was caused by the slippery road due to rain. The police and vehicle officials, who are also British, said that my brother was walking on the sidewalk and was not at fault, but the accident was unavoidable due to the slippery road. Their statement is absurd and hateful. According to regulations, Hankou Road is a one-way street from west to east, and cars should drive in the middle. However, the Westerner, relying on being an employee of the Municipal Council, did not follow the regulations and drove recklessly, causing this disaster. I immediately requested the court to detain the Westerner, but because the defendant is British, it could not be done according to the law. I think that if cars can recklessly drive onto the sidewalk and injure pedestrians without responsibility due to slippery roads, then no country would have such a law. Otherwise, the sidewalk can be renamed the car lane. How can the lives of pedestrians be protected? My brother's sacrifice is a small matter, but the safety of all citizens is a major concern. I am reporting the incident with tears and begging for justice and fairness. Moreover, Hankou Road is a one-way street, and the speed of cars is regulated. Cars should proceed in an orderly manner. Even if the road was slippery, no other roads with heavier traffic than Hankou Road that day, or cars driving on Hankou Road, had similar accidents. The fact that Inspector Li Quewei caused the accident proves that he did not follow traffic regulations and recklessly disregarded human life, causing this disaster. Furthermore, Li Quewei is an employee of your Bureau, and he dares to disobey the traffic regulations set by your Bureau. Your Bureau should find it difficult to excuse him for the accident in the same way that you punish Chinese public buses for repeated accidents. Based on the above, we hereby request that your Bureau respect the traffic regulations it has set and not abandon them. The employee Li Quewei should be immediately reported and suspended from duty, and the matter should be judged fairly according to the law to appease the people and uphold justice, so that humanity and the law can be maintained to satisfy the public."</p>

<p>One Thief Pulled Out a Gun and Tried to Resist Arrest; All Criminals Admitted to Planning a Robbery</p>
<p>Detective Shang Wu of the Huizhi Police Station received a tip-off the other day that a gang of thieves was gathering upstairs at a pancake shop at 125 Baker Road, plotting illegal activities. He and Western Detective Yang went to the address at 6:30 PM the day before yesterday and arrested seven thieves: Li Yueqing, Hu Xueming, Gu Qingyu, Wang A'er, Xu Zhande, Zhang Wenqi, and a woman, Xu Wangshi. At the time, Hu Xueming pulled out a pistol from his side, attempting to resist arrest, but was disarmed by the detectives, who seized a pistol with six bullets, as well as several pieces of jewelry. They were all taken to the police station, detained separately, and escorted to the Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, requested that all the arrested criminals be detained. The defendants, after being arrested, admitted that they intended to rob the city that night and gathered there beforehand. Li Yueqing, Hu Xueming, and Xu Zhande confessed to robbing two households at 49 Lane 4 and Lane 336 on Tongfu Road in June and July of this year. The seized jewelry was robbed from the French Concession. As the investigation of this case is not yet complete, a postponement was requested. Judge Wu Zehan reviewed the confessions, briefly questioned the defendants, and ordered them to be detained for seven days for further review.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Chen Lan, Who Once Escaped, Was Arrested Again, and Plotted a Second Jailbreak <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>He Sawed Through His Shackles and Two Iron Bars of His Cell; Three Bed Sheets Were Torn and Twisted into a Rope More Than Ten Feet Long</p>
<p>—His Actions Were Discovered by the Guard Before He Could Make a Move—</p>
<p>Murderer Chen Jinlan, nicknamed Snake Skin Jinlan, 32 years old, was involved in the murder of Chen Zhikui, the owner of the Qianfeng Feng Candle Shop on Xinqiao Street on the evening of April 14, 22nd year of the Republic of China, along with Zhu Quanxing from Wuxi. Zhu was arrested first, and Chen fled back to his hometown. In January of the following year, the French police sent officers to Ningbo to arrest Chen and bring him to Shanghai, where he was sentenced to 14 years in prison by the Second Special Court. After appeals to the High Third Branch Court and the Supreme Court, the sentence was reduced to 12 years. Chen was detained in the detention center of the Second Special Court and was about to be executed when he suddenly escaped from prison on December 27th of the previous year, resulting in the dismissal of the warden and the prosecution of guards Fang Yuqi and Zhou Wenjin. Fang was sentenced to two years and six months in prison, and Zhou was sentenced to two years. They appealed, but</p>
<p>Chen Escaped</p>
<p>and went to Hankou. Unable to make a living, he sneaked back to Shanghai and hid in the home of his fellow villager Bian Wuchang at 32 Lao Yong'an Street. On April 15th of this year, Detective Yang Zhongfang and Lu Dongliang of the Baofang detected and arrested Chen, and brought him to the Second Special Court, where he was sentenced to four years in prison. Chen appealed to the High Third Branch Court, which reduced the sentence to one year and six months. On August 16th, the High Third Branch Court sent Chen to the Second Special Prison to serve a sentence of 13 years and six months, stipulating that the time he had previously spent in the detention center would be deducted, and the sentence would expire in the year</p>
<p>37th of the Republic of China</p>
<p>on January 28th. After Chen was arrested, Warden Gao Xiaopian was reinstated by order of the ministry, as Chen's escape did not occur during Fang and Zhou's shift. Therefore, the High Third Branch Court declared them not guilty. After Chen was arrested, it was learned that he escaped at around 1:00 AM, during the shift of internal and external guards Yang Xingcun and Yan Ling. Yang and Yan were detained and transferred to the Second Special Court, where the prosecutor's office brought charges. After a trial by the Criminal Court, they were fined and dismissed. This is a historical dispute regarding Chen's escape. After Chen entered prison, he was assigned number 447 and detained in cell number 1 on the fourth floor of Block A. It was unexpected that the criminal in prison, regarding his</p>
<p>Undying Ambition</p>
<p>to escape, recently planned another jailbreak and acquired a steel saw about five inches long. Over the past three or four nights, he sawed through the shackles on his feet and two iron bars on the iron door of his cell. He also tore open his three bed sheets and twisted them into a cloth rope more than one zhang long, hoping to escape by hanging down from the window. After preparing everything, at 9:15 PM on the evening of the thirteenth (August), when all the prisoners were asleep, he crouched on the ground and peeked out of the iron door, and was discovered by guard Gong Keyuan (29 years old, from Anhui) on patrol, who secretly ordered another guard, Jin Zhenduo (37 years old, from Anhui), to report to Warden Mao Shun. The prison cell of Chen was searched,</p>
<h3 id="e140">First Special Court Continued Hearing Yesterday on the Postal Bureau Robbery Case <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Witnesses Described the Scene; Sikong Admitted to Carrying a Sack</p>
<p>a sack, a cloth rope was found, and Chen was taken out, shackled with heavier chains, and Xu Xinbao, a prisoner in cell number 10 in the same room (27 years old, from Jiangyin, sentenced to nine months in prison for theft and entered prison on August 7th), was isolated in another room. The next day, the warden reported to his superiors and found that prisoner Ji Quan (50 years old, from Pudong, sentenced to one year in prison last year for helping to traffic morphine and entered prison on December 22nd of last year), who was detained in cell number 12 on the third floor with number 557, was suspected of collusion. He was also taken out and shackled. Warden Sun Xiong prepared a document to transfer Chen and Xu to the prosecutor's office of the Special Court for</p>
<p>Investigation and Prosecution.</p>
<p>At 4:15 PM yesterday afternoon, Chief Prosecutor Wang and Secretary Zhao Yifen specially opened the Second Criminal Court and ordered the two prisoners to be brought to court for interrogation. First, guards Gong Keyuan and Jin Zhenduo reported the circumstances of the discovery and presented the seized steel saw and cloth rope. Chen Jinlan confessed to plotting an escape and admitted that he had been planning it for three weeks. Ji Jinquan talked to me about my previous escape from the detention center, and I had the idea of escaping again. About ten days ago, Ji found a saw and was playing with it at the window. I asked him for it. In the past three or four days, I first sawed through the iron bolt on the iron door at night, and then</p>
<p>sawed through the shackles</p>
<p>inside the quilt. On the night of the 13th, I peeked out of the door and was discovered by the guard. Ji Jinquan denied colluding and providing the saw. I am a handyman in prison and deliver tea and meals and empty chamber pots. I have known Chen for two months. Chen often asked me for vegetable soup, and sometimes I didn't give it to him because there wasn't enough, and he hated me and argued with me several times. Guards Chen Rensheng, Zhao Qi, and Zhu Kun know about it. Besides, I don't work in the workshop, so how could I have a saw to give him? And I only have three weeks left on my sentence. He is a serious offender with more than ten years. How could I collude with him to escape?</p>
<p>I am being falsely accused.</p>
<p>Please investigate. Xu Xin confessed that I was transferred to Chen's cell for only ten days. He does abacus during the day and we each sleep at night. I don't know about him sawing the iron door and shackles. I didn't see Chen having a saw or twisting cloth, etc. According to Warden Wang Yushou, the transfer of prisoners in the prison is under my management. Xu was transferred to cell number 1 on the fourth floor of Block A for only ten days. Prisoner Ji usually behaves well and is assigned to do chores, etc. Prosecutor Wang reviewed the confessions and ordered Chen and Ji to be held in the detention center and Xu to be sent back to prison for execution, pending further investigation and interrogation.</p>
<p>First Special Court Continued Hearing Yesterday on the Postal Bureau Robbery Case; Witnesses Described the Scene; Sikong Admitted to Carrying a Sack</p>
<p>On the morning of the 9th of last month, the Shanghai Postal Bureau was transferring a large sum of money, more than 91,000 yuan, when it was robbed by armed bandits who shot and killed two guards, Lü Ruilin and Yuan Bingshu, and wounded guard Zhou Yuchen. The robbers then escaped by car. Subsequently, the police successively arrested more than ten suspected men and women, and after repeated interrogations, dismissed those who were not involved. Eight men and women, including the monk Sikong, who came from north of the Yangtze River (also known as Ji Rentang), were detained separately. Judge Jiang Shuzi of the First Special District Court personally went to Tongren Hospital to question Zhou Yuchen and to the robbery site at the post office for an on-site investigation. All these details have been reported previously. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Jiang opened the court and ordered the men and women criminals, including monk Sikong, Qiu Guobin, Li Yisheng, Li Xueshi, Wu Pangui, Wang Chenshi, Ji Chenshi, and Chen Qiushi, to be brought to the court. Several witnesses were also summoned. First, lawyer Li Zhishan of the police department stated the</p>
<p>circumstances of the arrest</p>
<p>of the criminals. He then stated that Li Yisheng, Wu Pangui, and Li Xueshi were not prosecuted previously. It has now been investigated that Li Yisheng and Wu Pangui are both involved and are being prosecuted together with Sikong, etc. However, Li Xueshi still needs to be investigated further and should remain in custody. He then presented the clothes and accessories purchased by the criminals with the stolen money to the court. The court immediately questioned Li Xueshi, who stated that Liu Xiaosi's sister, the mother of Zhu Xiaomao, was being detained by officials in Funing, and asked me to go to</p>
<p>Funing to Shanghai</p>
<p>on the sixth day of the ninth month. I arrived on the ninth day. Xiaomao gave me more than 200 yuan and asked me to take it back for use, etc. Judge Jiang, because the police department still needs to investigate the part about Li Xueshi, ordered him to be remanded in custody and interrogated again next Wednesday. He then began to investigate the facts of the crime of the other defendants. The Chinese and Western detectives from Disweilu Police Station reported the circumstances of the arrest of the defendants. Then, a Western detective from Hongkou Police Station reported going to the post office to</p>
<p>investigate the situation</p>
<p>after the robbery occurred. The court then summoned Yang Binglin, an employee of the Postal Bureau's Revenue and Expenditure Office, to ask about the circumstances of the robbery and injury. According to Yang, at 9:46 AM on September 9th, the money transport vehicle of the Savings and Remittance Bureau drove to the post office square. I and Zhu Xijiu escorted the money downstairs, all of which were banknotes, totaling 91,937 yuan, stored in a sack. The old accountant carried it on his shoulder, with the old accountant in front, followed by two guards. I and Zhu Dianzhi had just gone downstairs when we suddenly heard gunshots, and Zhou Yuchen immediately fell to the ground. I was shocked and</p>
<p>ran back upstairs</p>
<p>to escape. Therefore, I didn't see or know how Lü Ruilin and the old accountant were shot. The location was originally the post office's parking lot, etc. Zhu Xijiu's statement was similar to Yang's. According to Gu Dawei, a post office driver, at that time, I saw the money being transported downstairs and went into the car to sit in the driver's seat. Suddenly, I heard a gunshot and Zhou Yuchen had fallen in front of the car. I knew there was a robbery and escaped from the car. Therefore, I didn't see the old accountant and another guard being shot and killed by the robbers. I only saw one of the robbers</p>
<p>wearing a black long gown.</p>
<p>A Western mechanic from the post office's automobile workshop testified that he saw four robbers running through the automobile workshop and fleeing to Tongtian Road, where they entered a car parked at the corner of the New Asia Hotel and drove away. The four robbers, one carrying a sack, threatened him with a pistol to prevent him from making a sound. He can't remember the faces of the robbers now, but he felt that one of them was wearing a black long gown. Bao Pinpu, a painter from the post office's automobile workshop, testified that he also saw a robber carrying a sack, and the robber holding the gun was wearing a black long gown. According to the letter carrier Ye Xiujin, he</p>
<p>was returning from outside</p>
<p>and saw about five or six robbers getting out of the car. Most of them were holding pistols, and they quickly got into the car. He quickly used a pencil to record the license plate number of the robbers' car on the door. According to Kong Xianrong, a driver from the Dalai Automobile Company, that morning, the robbers came to hire a car, saying they were going to the city center. Initially, there was only one person in the car, and when they passed Qimei Road, four more people came. Then, someone forced me out of the car with a pistol and</p>
<p>tied me up in the wilderness.</p>
<p>They all spoke with a Yancheng accent. The two people who tied me up, if seen, can still be identified, etc. In addition, postal workers Zhu Xinfa and Fan Qing'er, postal police officers, all testified to the circumstances when the Chinese and Western detectives escorted Sikong to the post office to reenact the robbery, and Sikong admitted to carrying the sack and that Liu Xiaosi fired the gun. At this point, because it was getting late, the court ordered all the defendants to be remanded in custody for further interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Lei Wen Petitions for Bankruptcy, Willing to Abide by the Court's Judgment <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>According to the Da Mei Evening News, Mr. He Fu, the liquidator of three companies, including American Feng Bank, previously sued Lei Wen in the U.S. Court for China for illegally receiving remunerations of 135,000 taels each from American Sheng Bank, American Dong Bank, and Puyi Real Estate Company, requesting the court to order the payment of interest. The case was heard this morning (16th) by Chief Justice Hillermeck. First, Dr. Xue Laite, the lawyer for Mr. He Fu, stated that an agreement had been reached to merge the three cases. The original plaintiff requested the repayment of the remuneration received from the three companies with interest. However, since the funds from American Dong Bank had been repaid by Lei Wen, only the interest from January 1932 to February 23, 1933, at an annual rate of 6%, was requested. Subsequently, Mr. Lei Wen's lawyer, Mr. Evans, announced that Mr. Lei Wen was willing to abide by the court's judgment and would soon file for bankruptcy voluntarily. Therefore, Mr. Hillermeck stated that since the defendant had this intention, there was nothing to be done in court and ordered Mr. Xue Laite to draft the judgment and send it to Mr. Evans before adjourning the court. Although Mr. Lei Wen was present in court today, he did not say a word. Due to today's developments, the court will issue an order for Mr. Lei Wen to pay the funds requested by Mr. He Fu and will appoint a custodian to manage Mr. Lei Wen's assets to liquidate them for repayment. After the adjournment, Mr. Evans stated that Mr. Lei Wen's bankruptcy petition would likely be filed within this week and that he would invite his creditors, including representatives of the three closed companies and the custodian of Puyi Real Estate Company, to participate in a meeting to elect a custodian of Mr. Lei Wen's assets. It is reported that Mr. Lei Wen's residence on Hongqiao Road will also be included in his assets. Mr. Evans' statement in court today was lengthy. After he finished, Mr. Xue Laite stated that Mr. Evans' statement did not mention Mr. Lei Wen's embezzlement and receipt of funds from Puyi Bank.

<h3 id="e143">Strange Incident with Lili Automobile: Circular Hole in the Glass <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>A Loud Bang, Smaller on the Outside, Larger on the Inside. Passengers in the Car Showed No Unusual Behavior.</p>
<p>At 10:30 AM yesterday, the Third Branch of Lili Automobile Company on Avenue de Sapey in the French Concession received a phone call from Qingxin Middle School on Lujiabang Road in the Nanshi area, requesting to hire a car to be sent to Zhengyi Middle School in Fahuazhen. The company's accountant immediately dispatched driver Jiang Alin (from Yangzhou) in car number 13857 (Municipal Permit No. 4757). Upon arriving at Qingxin School, a person, appearing to be a teacher, around 40 years old, boarded the car. Jiang Alin immediately drove at full speed towards Fahua. Unexpectedly, when the car reached the intersection of Avenue Courbet and Avenue de Sapey in the French Concession, driver Jiang Alin suddenly heard a loud bang on the windshield. Upon careful inspection, he discovered a small circular hole, resembling one caused by a gunshot. However, before the sound, no gunshot had been heard. Jiang immediately became suspicious. Upon delivering the customer to Fahua and returning to the branch, he immediately reported the incident to the accountant. To be cautious, the accountant ordered Jiang Alin to drive the original car to the French Police Station. The police chief immediately dispatched several Chinese and Western detectives to conduct a detailed investigation at the scene of the incident. However, after inquiring with nearby shops and residents, all stated that they had not heard any gunshots at the time. The most peculiar thing was that the hole on the window was smaller on the outside and larger on the inside, the outer hole as small as a grain of rice, and the inner hole as large as a longan, resembling a shot from inside the car to the outside. However, at the time, there was only one customer inside the car, and the customer showed no unusual behavior. The police are currently investigating.</p>

Afterwards, the police took the landlord, Mr. Ji, and the child to the police station.</p>
<h3 id="e145">The Great World: Actor Wu Junshan Accidentally Kills a Man with a Punch <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Accusations of Harassment of Female Performers, Victim's History of Inappropriate Behavior; Protecting Cousin Leads to Assault, Resulting in Accidental Death</p>
<p>Wang Meizhen, originally named Wang Meizhen, a fifteen-year-old female performer from Shanghai, residing at No. 34, Yunchunfang, Julai Road, in the French Concession, performs in the Great World amusement park's Da Jing opera troupe. Wu Junshan (30 years old, from Jiaxing), residing at No. 3, Gaosheng Lane, Danshui Road, who performs martial roles in the Great World Peking Opera troupe, is Wang Meizhen's cousin and a fellow student. On the 15th, Wang took a break from work and visited her cousin Wu Junshan at Gaosheng Lane on Danshui Road. At 2:00 PM, she accompanied Wu to the Great World on Rue Sainte Marie, walking west along Julai Road. Unexpectedly, Guan Jinshan, a native of Changshu, around 30 years old, a waiter at the Malishi Xiyuan Tea House, passed by Julai Road and, upon seeing Wang's beauty, followed closely, harassing her with flirtatious words and indecent jokes. Wu Junshan witnessed Guan's misconduct and felt indignant. He initially tried to dissuade Guan, but Guan ignored him and continued his harassment. When they reached the intersection of Julai Road and Rue Sainte Marie, Guan even grabbed Wang's hand. Wu, upon seeing this, immediately intervened. Guan responded with abusive language. Wu, in a moment of anger, feeling that Guan was beyond reason, punched Guan in the right cheek. Guan, upon being struck, lost his balance and fell backward, his head hitting the stone curb of the pedestrian sidewalk. He was injured and immediately lost consciousness. Wu Liren, patrolman No. 403 stationed there, and detective Xu Guilin, who were passing by, apprehended Wu Junshan and hired a car to take the injured Guan Jinsheng to the Central Police Station in Lokawei. After interrogation by the police chief, Wu was detained. The police also ordered Guan to be sent to Guangci Hospital. Due to severe head trauma, medical treatment was ineffective, and Guan died at 3:30 AM the following morning. The hospital notified the police, who sent the body to Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for autopsy. At noon yesterday, Wang Ren, a prosecutor from the Second Special District Court, was appointed, along with a forensic doctor and a clerk, to inspect the body at the funeral home. It was determined that the deceased, Guan Jinsheng, died from injuries sustained from being punched and falling. According to a report by Detective Zhang Chunsheng, and the testimonies of patrolman No. 403 and the woman Wang Meizhen, the situation at the time was as described above. Since the deceased's family was not in Shanghai and no one came forward, the official ordered the body to be temporarily buried by the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home, pending family identification. The police then escorted Wu Junshan to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, where Judge Zhang presided over the trial with Clerk Gao Yanmao. Fei Xizhen, a lawyer from the Police Department, presented the case, stating that the Police Department's investigation into the defendant's injury resulting in death was not yet complete and requested a postponement pending further investigation. The defendant, Wu Junshan, testified that the deceased was drunk yesterday and, along with four other people, was making lewd comments all the way from Chengdu Road. He first warned the deceased, but he ignored him and grabbed his cousin's hand. He then pushed him, and he fell to the ground. Now he is dead. It was a momentary mistake, and he had no animosity towards him. The woman, Wang Meizhen, testified that the deceased was harassing her, asking her if she wanted to go to a hotel room. She scolded him, but he grabbed her hand. She pushed him away, but he tried to grab her again. Her cousin first warned him, but he ignored him and then hit him. She had already walked away when the deceased fell. Patrolman No. 403 testified that he only saw the defendant fighting with the deceased, and the defendant punched the deceased in the face, causing him to fall and become motionless. He then apprehended the defendant and hired a car to take the deceased to the police station and then to the hospital. He knew nothing else. Detective Xu Guilin reported to the court that the deceased was initially unconscious but regained consciousness after being sent to the hospital. He stated that the defendant punched him, causing him to fall. The body was sent to the prosecutor for examination this morning. The court reviewed the testimonies and adjourned the hearing to the 25th. The defendant was remanded in custody. It was also reported that after the autopsy, an elderly man, Mr. A, claiming to be the deceased's father, went to inspect the body. He stated that the deceased had an elderly mother and brothers in his hometown, and he had already sent a letter to notify them to come to Shanghai to claim the body.</p>

<p>According to the Continental News, at 5:00 PM on Tuesday, a Chinese man in Western attire came to the Hongkou Automobile Company at 1609 North Sichuan Road and hired a car, saying that his car had broken down in Jiangwan and he needed a car to tow it to a repair shop. When the car reached Qiujiang Road, two foreigners flagged it down and boarded the car. They then ordered the driver to drive to Rue St. Cotta, saying that they wanted to send a girlfriend to Xinghua Lou on Fuzhou Road. They then suddenly ordered the driver to go to Jiangwan Road. While driving on Route Pichon, the driver saw in the rearview mirror that the two foreigners were pulling out handguns from their raincoats. He immediately stopped the car and begged them not to shoot. However, they gagged and tied him up and abandoned him in a field by the road. They then sped away in the car. The driver then shouted for help and was found by two passersby who heard him. They called the police and released him. They also reported the incident to the police stations of the Public and French Concessions, requesting their assistance in the investigation. The car was later found by Public Concession patrolmen at the corner of Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road at 9:30 PM. According to the police, the three men robbed the car for kidnapping purposes.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Key Suspect Luo Yusheng Demonstrates the Two Murders <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Judges and Clerks Listen Quietly in the Next Room; Luo Admits His Guilt Only After Seeing the Judge</p>
<p>The wife of the late former Ningbo District Court Prosecutor Jin Zhaojin, Jin Dai Shi, also known as Baozhen, and her children lived on the third floor of 459 North Henan Road, near the intersection of Elgin Road. On the morning of the 23rd of last month, she was found murdered in her bedroom. The hired maid, Ms. Luo, was also murdered. Afterwards, detective Shang Wu from the relevant Huishi Police Station arrested the key suspect, Luo Yusheng, a native of Yiwu, Zhejiang, and the current director of academic affairs at Mingchen Elementary School on Xinqiao Road in Nanshi. The victims' property and an axe were recovered. The case was transferred to the First Special District Local Court for repeated interrogations. As reported previously, Judge Liu Yugui, in charge of the case, found that Luo always denied the murders during the trials. However, according to Detective Shang's report, Luo confessed in the police station that he colluded with a man surnamed Xu and a man surnamed Ma, meeting at the intersection of North Henan Road and Laobazi Road, and then going to Jin Dai Shi's residence. Taking advantage of the absence of her children, who had gone to school, he kept watch downstairs while Xu and Ma went upstairs and murdered Jin Dai Shi and the maid. Then he entered the room to steal property. When Luo was confronted with this information, he claimed that the confession was coerced by the police, making it difficult to determine the truth. To clarify the truth and avoid wrongly accusing anyone, Judge Liu, accompanied by the clerk and trial lawyer Zhang Tianyin from the police station, went to the scene of the crime at 459 North Henan Road, near the intersection of Elgin Road, on the afternoon of the previous day. After inspecting the scene, they went to rest in a small room next to the victim's bedroom. After a while, Detective Shang and others brought Luo Yusheng upstairs to the victim's bedroom and asked him about the murders. Luo, initially unaware that the judge, clerk, police station, and lawyer were in the adjacent room, and unguarded, spoke freely as he had in the police station. He recounted how he had kept watch downstairs while Xu and Ma murdered Jin Dai Shi and the maid, and then how he went upstairs to steal property. Detective Shang and others waited until he had finished speaking before taking him to the adjacent room. Luo, upon seeing the judge sitting there, the clerk recording his previous statements, was shocked and lost color. Judge Liu then asked, "You have repeatedly claimed in court that your confession in the police station was coerced. Now, there is no coercion of any kind, and you have confessed so much yourself. Your confession must be sincere." The clerk then read the transcript aloud. Luo bowed his head and confessed his guilt. Judge Liu, knowing that before the crime, the perpetrators had met at the intersection of North Henan Road and Laobazi Road, wanted to clarify the facts. He ordered a car to be driven to that location, with Luo being escorted by Detective Shang. A patrolman was stationed there. Judge Liu ordered Luo to demonstrate where he had gotten out of the car, where Xu and Ma were waiting, how he held the axe, who was in front and who was behind when they left. Luo's demonstration was vivid. The patrolman drove away bystanders to maintain order while observing the demonstration, so he could testify in court today. Luo, though cunning, would find it difficult to deny the facts. Judge Liu's handling of this case was particularly painstaking.</p>

<p>According to the Continental News, a Western woman, Ms. Staitain-Co, residing at No. 210 Huanlong Road, filed a complaint with the French police, claiming that she was assaulted by an Italian couple on the night of October 8th and requested a thorough investigation and intended to sue in court. According to her statement, at around 5:00 PM that day, she met an Italian man on Avenue Massenet who offered her a ride home in his car. After entering the car, he drove to Lokawei and stopped in front of a building near the Second Special District Court. A woman, the Italian man's wife, came out and got into the car. The car then drove west towards Hongqiao Road. Before reaching Hongqiao Road, the Italian couple assaulted her, tore her clothes, cut her hair with scissors, and subjected her to other ill-treatment. When the car reached Hongqiao Road, they pushed her out of the car. She fainted by the roadside. Fortunately, two young men, probably British, saw her while driving by in a car and helped her into their car and took her home. The French police were skeptical of the woman's statement but conducted an investigation. It is reported that a report has been prepared and will be sent to the Italian authorities today or tomorrow. At the same time, Mr. Pu Laimi, who is handling this case, has placed an advertisement asking the two young men who drove the woman home that day to come to the police station to testify.

<p>Zhang Aben Confesses the Details; Shen Yougen Also Detained</p>
<p>The harm of flower gambling is worse than floods and fierce beasts. Its deep poisoning of society is truly hateful. Therefore, Director Yan of the Municipal Public Security Bureau previously ordered a strict ban, and the joint meetings of the heads of various sub-bureaus, regardless of jurisdiction, worked together to search and arrest those involved. Those engaged in it initially became somewhat secretive. However, over time, it revived. At 1:30 PM the other day, patrolman Chen Shusheng of the City God Temple Police Station, led police officer Wang Hanzhang, in checking household registrations within the jurisdiction, to the room of Gu Qian Shi (62 years old, from Suzhou) at No. 137 Sipaifang. A man, Zhang Aben (20 years old, from Wuxi), looked flustered. Upon inspection, 54 flower gambling slips, two yuan and eight jiao in silver, 14 jiao in small coins, and copper coins were found. Because the amount of money did not match, he was asked where he sent the lottery tickets. He said that the main lottery booth was not fixed. To avoid being caught by the police, he sometimes hired a large taxi to open the lottery booth in the car. He also stated that the flower gambling tickets he collected were entrusted to him by Chen Jiagui, who owned a rice store at No. 153 Erpailou. After being taken to the police station, Chen Jiagui and Chen Zhang Shi were immediately detained. During interrogation, they denied the charges. Also, at noon yesterday, the station received a report from detective Yuan Zhigang that Jiang Chunsheng and Jiang Fubei, both from Ningbo, were privately collecting flower gambling funds in Anning Lane, Guanyilu. Director Liu dispatched patrolman Qiang Yude to lead police officers to arrest them and seize flower gambling books and folded flower gambling slips. According to Jiang, they were entrusted by Shen Yougen, the son of Shen Fandai, who specializes in collecting flower gambling funds. Since Shen Fandai had been arrested repeatedly, the police were ordered to detain Shen Yougen for interrogation and hand him over to the General Bureau for strict punishment.</p>

<p>— (Huanglian)</p>
<p>"People should be independent and also cooperative." Everyone knows these two sentences.</p>
<p>However, "independence" and "cooperation" are interconnected: neither is dispensable!</p>
<p>If there is only "independence" but no "cooperation"! Then it is like "a heap of loose sand!"</p>
<p>Conversely, if there is only "cooperation"! But no "independence!" Then it becomes a bustling "mass of parasites!"</p>
<p>Because it is necessary for everyone to be "independent"! To increase the strength of "cooperation!"</p>
<p>It is like ten arrows, each broken, then putting them together is useless. Ten arrows, none broken. Putting them together, then it is not easy to break!</p>
<p>Everyone "cooperates!" to consolidate the bulwark of "independence!" For example, a piece of iron, a furnace of fire, will naturally melt it. Gather hundreds of pieces of iron together, and a furnace of fire will have no way to melt it.</p>
<p>Therefore, I hope that the four hundred and fifty million compatriots! Everyone must have the spirit of "independence"! At the same time, there must also be the organization of "cooperation!" This is a new line of hope for the future of the country!</p>

<p>My neighbor, Mr. Fang, is already sixty years old, and is a Confucian gentleman who does not look at or speak of anything improper. Because he only has two beloved daughters who are both married, and has no son to inherit his legacy, not only is Mr. Fang himself often worried, but he also often suffers the ridicule of his sister-in-law, making him even more unhappy. This is what led Mr. Fang to "rent a wife."</p>
<p>One evening, I remember Mr. Fang, holding a dry tobacco pipe in his left hand and an almanac in his right, walking slowly to chat with my grandmother. My grandmother, wrinkling her forehead and pursing her lips, smiled with her old eyes at Mr. Fang and said, "I heard that the country wife—that is, Mr. Fang's newly rented wife—is eating red eggs. Congratulations! Congratulations! In the future, when you have a little Binnsay, we will all have to drink a few more cups of wine." Mr. Fang replied with a chuckle, "The red eggs are being eaten, but I can't guarantee whether it will be a boy or a girl. Amitabha, it all depends on the help of the Bodhisattva!" As he spoke, he puffed out smoke from his mouth like clouds. Standing in front of my grandmother's knee, I thought: Maybe Mr. Fang was just "chanting."</p>
<p>Mr. Fang knocked the tobacco ash off the ground with his pipe, then flipped through a few pages of the almanac and handed it to my grandmother. I peeked at it, and saw a small red circle marked on × month ×× day. I was very surprised. I saw Mr. Fang extend his thin, long finger and point to the red circle, saying: On this day, I went to the country to spend the night with my wife. Now I have this small red circle as proof. Counting it, she is already three months pregnant. My grandmother said: Hmm! I see.</p>
<p>Now, young Mr. Fang is already twenty-one years old, although his appearance and demeanor are not very similar to Mr. Fang. When I recall this interesting story, if anyone doubts it, I am willing to be a witness. I wonder if this "proof of crystallization" almanac still exists today?</p>
<h3 id="e163">Recent Salt Crisis <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Yiqiu</p>
<p>In the area of the two seacoasts of Yuyao, hundreds of miles, live ten thousand salt farmers, relying on their blood and sweat, strength, in the scorching sun and salt water, to earn a family's food and clothing. Each pound of salt can only sell for two or three copper coins, and their lives are very miserable and pitiful. Recently, salt barns have stopped collecting extra salt due to accumulated inventory, further plunging them into despair.</p>
<p>Due to the above reasons, a great crisis has arisen among the salt farmers in the Xiangongdian area in the past two days. Many salt farmers surrounded the salt barns, forcing them to open the scales, but the barns, due to years of losses and accumulated inventory, insisted on not allowing it. The two sides clashed many times, almost causing a riot. Later, after persuasion, the salt farmers elected representatives to go to the Salt Commissioner's Office in Hangzhou to petition. Most of the responsible managers of the barns did not dare to live in the barns and fled to other places.</p>
<p>As for the reason for the accumulated inventory in the salt barns, it is due to the impact of refined salt dumping. According to people in the salt barns: "The salt transport in Jiangsu and Zhejiang is a tax-inclusive monopoly system. For example, a certain salt merchant pays a certain amount of tax every year and has the exclusive right to transport salt in a certain area. In the past, the salt barns always had a surplus every year, the taxes could be paid, and the salt farmers had food to eat. But in recent years, the government has also allowed the transportation and sale of refined salt. Refined salt is produced in the north, and because the purchase price is low, the price is not higher than that of coarse salt from Yuyao. More and more people in the folk are changing to eat refined salt, and the power of refined salt is growing day by day, filling various places and encroaching on the market of coarse salt, so the salt barns are losing money every year, and the salt farmers in Yuyao are in danger."</p>
<p>Although, recently, it is said that the Zhejiang Salt Transport Commissioner has drafted a compromise solution, allowing the salt barns to collect salt at 60% of the quota, it is still a question whether the salt farmers will agree and whether the barns can sell the new salt collected at this 60% rate. Even if the salt farmers agree, but the barns already have accumulated inventory, and if they collect new goods and they remain unsold, it is difficult to guarantee that the old tune will not be repeated next year—stopping the collection of extra salt—I think this is not a fundamental solution. The rice for two people can never be combined to feed one person! I hope that the wise authorities will understand this point and make a thorough reform. I, as a small person, dare not defend the salt merchants, but I really cannot bear to see the hundreds of thousands of salt farmers who are already in despair, and I know the key problem but dare not remain silent.</p>

<p>Chapter 20: Struggling for Life to See Beloved Grandson, Embracing Each Other and Shedding Tears, Remembering the Past in a Famine Year, Sowing Wheat and Bringing Disaster</p>
<p>The old lady didn't say anything, put her withered, waxy left hand around him, and tears fell like thrown sand. Yueying sobbed, Zhu Hu's held his sleeves and sobbed too. Sister-in-law Hu stood on the side, looking at these three generations, at their miserable situation, and couldn't help but feel pain in her heart, and started crying with the three of them. This immediately alarmed all the travelers in the inn, who gathered around to watch. When they asked what happened, although they couldn't openly criticize Jia Duocai for being wrong, they all nodded and sighed at the silent frustration. As everyone watched, the tea room saw that the situation was getting out of hand, so he found Sister-in-law Hu and said: Hey! You know the situation here, you brought these people here to cry for no reason, what kind of look is that? If Mr. Jia comes back, I can't afford it. You guys go away! Old lady Zhu wiped away her tears and said: I can't leave, I will die if I leave. I finally got to see my child, how can I leave? The tea room said: If you don't leave, are you planning to stay in our lobby forever? This is a thoroughfare. Sister-in-law Hu saw that these three generations were clinging to each other, and it was not easy to tear them apart suddenly, so she frowned and said: I don't have the strength to make them leave immediately. We don't dare to enter Mr. Jia's room randomly, I think we should find a small room here and let them sit down and talk for a while, and when they finish saying what they want to say, they will naturally disperse. The tea room smiled indifferently: You said it so easily, we opened a room and let them go in to talk, who will pay for the room? The smallest room costs eighty cents a day. (341)</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Although the appearance of these bathtubs is the same, they all have secret signs underneath to distinguish their uses, and they must not be confused. (If they are accidentally confused, the Empress Dowager will definitely not let it go.)—Filled with warm water, it was lifted all the way to the Empress Dowager's feet before being placed down. The Empress Dowager then immersed both feet in the basin, and the four palace maids, following the previous method, soaped her, changed towels, and continued to apply the Camellia Oil. I watched coldly from the side, and soon discovered that the skills of the four palace maids were indeed exceptionally skilled and agile. They knew how much force to use to wring the soaked towels almost dry, how much soap to apply to the towels, and how gently to rub off the dirt without causing the Empress Dowager pain, and how to pat the oil dry; obviously, these skills could not be mastered overnight. Then the effort they spent learning in the beginning must have been very long! I think it would not be an exaggeration to treat them as specialized artisans.</p>
<p>After washing the lower body, the Empress Dowager immediately put on her trousers, and the bathing process was declared complete. But wait, there is still a final procedure! The four palace maids had to take another set (four) of new towels to wipe the Empress Dowager's fingers and face. After all, I don't quite remember how many times new towels were changed, but let me tell you, there are ten palace maids in the palace who do nothing all day except wash the Empress Dowager's clothes, etc. You can know that even if the old lady uses forty towels every time she washes, it is not impossible!

<p>The fragrance of sweet osmanthus and the opening of golden chestnut barrels indicate that it is already the mid-autumn season! White clouds caress my house, and I often dream of my lovely hometown, Wuxi. I remember in the autumn of a certain year, the farmers who rented the graveyard offered Du chestnuts for sale, their fragrance was refreshing and their golden color was lovely. They were indeed the genuine goods from Niangniangtang in Huishan, and one yuan could buy half a kilogram. After removing the skin, mix them with Hunan lotus seeds and cook them for breakfast. You don't need to add much sugar to feel that they are fragrant and sweet. Sweet osmanthus and chestnuts are not easy to cultivate, and the yield is very small. In the past, there were many customer chestnuts that were used as fake, and the villagers were very angry. They asked my friend Lawyer Jiang Gongjian to warn and protect them, and they gradually disappeared. This year, because someone bought the whole batch with a hundred taels of gold, the market price is extremely high, and one tael of gold can only buy fourteen taels.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Sweat <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Chuyu</p>
<p>When we arrive in summer, we often develop a strong body odor, which varies depending on race (white or yellow) and gender (male or female). However, the body odor that each person emits is mainly sweat, so it can also be called sweat odor. A person's sweat odor varies depending on their diet. That is, the sweat glands that secrete on the surface of each person's skin play an excretory role in the body's functions through the lungs, kidneys, stomach, and other organs. When the weather is hot, the blood vessels in the skin expand, and the secretion of sweat glands is particularly strong. That is, the secretion of sweat glands releases the excess body temperature to the outside, so after we sweat, we can regulate body temperature. Just like when the body is sick, with chills and fever, if you take antipyretic medicine, the sweat glands will secrete, and then you will break into a sweat, and the heat can be relieved immediately. As such, sweat and hygiene are really closely related. Now we need to pay attention to the following points: (1) Decayed sweat will stimulate the skin. Sweat is secreted and quickly decays, so it produces a strange odor. Sweat odor stimulates the skin very severely. Children are often stimulated by sweat odor, which reduces the skin's resistance, and they are prone to eczema and sores. Therefore, after sweating, it should be washed immediately to prevent accumulation. Women with very long hair accumulate a lot of sweat, which can easily cause hair loss. (2) Sweating while sleeping is very dangerous, because people who are sound asleep experience a decrease in body temperature after sweating, which can easily cause colds. In severe cases, it can cause pleurisy and pulmonary catarrh. If a person is mentally tired and has a weak chest, sweating while sleeping is a type of fatigue toxin and is extremely unsuitable. Therefore, to prevent sweating while sleeping, you can drink a cup of warm milk before going to bed. (3) There is also a type of armpit odor, which is even more uncomfortable. Armpit odor is mostly caused by the development of sexual desire. There is no armpit odor in childhood, and the armpit odor of men and women is different, which is related to sexual dimorphism. As for the most intense body odor in the body, the part where the sweat glands are densely packed is the greatest, that is, the armpits, palms, soles, groins, etc. (4) In general, diet has a great influence on sweat. For example, after eating breakfast, the ingredients of the food are mixed into the sweat and excreted outside the skin. Northerners like to eat green onions and garlic, so they have the smell of green onions and garlic. When musk deer reach puberty, they secrete aromatic substances in their reproductive glands. (5) Among all the races in the world, the body odor is the greatest in black people, followed by white people. However, body odor will also decrease with age, because the functions of the elderly have been closed off. It is said that Concubine Yang was very beautiful, but she had two major problems, namely bad breath and armpit odor. Emperor Tang Ming asked the imperial physician to give her lychees, which gradually eliminated the bad breath, and used perfume to bathe to relieve the armpit odor. The King of Peru liked body odor the most. When he chose a queen, he ordered the noble women to gather in a dark dance floor. After the women danced for half an hour, when their bodies sweated, the king would burrow into the women, and the one with the strongest body odor would be chosen as the queen. This peculiar habit is truly unique, similar to the habit of eating scabs.</p>
<p>Literary News - There were the most essays in the Ming Dynasty. Famous writers were praised by contemporaries. Yuan Zongdao, Yuan Hongdao, and Yuan Zhongdao of the Gong'an School and Zhong Xing and Tan Yuanchun of the Jingling School were considered outstanding essayists of the Ming Dynasty. In fact, writers such as Xu Wenchang and Tang Bohu in the flourishing period of the Ming Dynasty and Chen Jiru and Tang Xianzu in the late Ming Dynasty were not necessarily above the Yuan and Zhong School. Now the owner of Dadao Bookstore has specially released his family's collection of Xu Wenchang, Chen Jiru, Tang Xianzu, Tang Bohu, Zhu Yunming, and Wen Zhengming's complete works, compiled into the Complete Works of Six Famous Essayists of the Ming Dynasty, and handed it over to Jiuzhou Bookstore on Fourth ____ Road for pre-sale.

<h3 id="e169">Finance　December Officially Begins　Standard Gold Suddenly Boosted by Major Players <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Actually Rose to 926 Yuan and a Half</p>
<p>The spot market of gold futures ended yesterday, and the December futures officially began. Major players competed to boost the price, which was suddenly surrounded by buying interest. Sellers, who were already in the process of being eliminated, were caught off guard. The supply of chips in the market was extremely tight, showing a great potential for soaring. Unfortunately, industry players were over-invested in long positions and had limited funds. They took the opportunity to close out positions at high prices, so although the situation looked good in the morning, there were many reversals during the day. In the early morning, the overseas silver market showed that both the British and American markets were flat. The forward silver price in Montreux remained unchanged or decreased by up to one and a half points. Exchange rates uniformly increased. The spot gold price in London decreased by half a penny. It was reported that 50 million yuan of new banknotes from the Bank of China had already been printed in Shanghai, but the approval from the Ministry of Finance was still pending. This news somewhat stimulated the market sentiment. In addition, with the end of the spot market, many short sellers were pre-emptively buying. Because long positions were actively traded previously, the pre-market trading outside the exchange opened at 16-17 yuan, showing a trend of demand exceeding supply. Major players such as Da De Cheng, Fu Xing Yong, Da Da, and Fu Yu entered the market. The Central Bank's official gold price was announced, with both British and American prices decreasing. The Customs Gold Unit increased by 1.2%. The standard gold price rose to 928.5 yuan, actually breaking through the 20 yuan mark. After the opening, because the Jewish merchant Qiao Zhibu dumped forward shillings, it retreated within 20 yuan and once turned to decline. However, because major players competed to purchase and banks also took on a large number of orders, it soon broke through 20 yuan again. The domestic market was also tight and rose even more. It was anticipated that the HSBC's official prices for British and American currencies would be flat. Later, HSBC took advantage of the high prices to sell, and long positions took advantage of the high prices to close out, gradually returning to flat. It once fell back to within 20 yuan, but the buyers saw the low price and competed to purchase, easily recovering. Afterwards, major players repeatedly purchased, and the Guangdong trading group also came to pursue, lacking supply sources and rising steadily. The prediction was that Indian silver would shrink by two annas. The trend was firmer at noon. Although the future looks high, it is inevitable that it will fluctuate, because it seems that the Chinese buyers are already full, and the ability to add more is limited. The market situation for half a day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 920.3 yuan, an increase of 15 yuan compared to the previous close. If the spot premium is removed, it is good for 9 yuan. Then it was 0.5 yuan. Da De Cheng, Hui Xiang, Heng Yu, Da Fa, Yong Fu Xing, and Yong sold off, falling to 17 yuan. Citibank bought December shillings for half a penny. Da De Cheng, Fu Yu, Da Da, and Heng Yu came in, rising to 20 yuan. Qiao Zhibu came to the market to buy December shillings for half a penny. Wan Yu, Heng Yu, and Hui Xiang sold off, retreating to 18.2 yuan. Heng Chang Yong, Yong Li, Ri Chang, Fu Yu, Yong Da, and Da came in, breaking through the 20 yuan mark again, rising to 23 yuan. Zhejiang sold November US dollars for 125. Ding Kang, Da De Cheng, Chun Yuan, and Yong sold off, falling to 1.5 yuan. Heng Chang Yong, Da De Cheng, Fu Xing, and Yong came in, rising again to 4.3 yuan. It was anticipated that HSBC's official price would not change. People's hearts were still calm. Da Da, Da De Cheng, Yuan Mao Yong, and Wan Xing sold off, retreating to 0.5 yuan. Da De Cheng, Da Da, and Tong Yi bought, while Yong Li, Da De Cheng, and Da Da sold again, and the Overseas Chinese HSBC sold shillings, breaking the 20 yuan mark, falling to 19.3 yuan. Da Da, Heng Yu, and Tong Fu took advantage of the low prices to enter at 21 yuan. Da Da, Da De Cheng, Yi Cheng sold again at 19.5 yuan. Yuan Yi, Fu An, Tong Fu, Heng Yu, Yuan Mao Yong, Yong Qian Yuan, Yong Yong Li rushed to buy, gradually rising to 23.3 yuan. Fu Yu, Tong Tai Chang, and Heng Yu sold, falling to 1.7 yuan. Da De Cheng, Da Da, Yuan Chang Yong, Heng Yu, Hui Xiang, Yi Feng, Yong Fu Yu, and Hong Xing rushed to buy, and it rose again to 4 yuan. Da De Cheng, Fu Xing, Yong Shen Feng, Da Da, and Li Feng repeatedly sold off, falling to 20.7 yuan. Heng Yu, Da De Cheng, Fu Xing, Yong Hui Xiang, and Yong Li entered again at 5.3 yuan. Citibank came out with December US dollars at 6875. Da Fa Yong, Heng Yu, Heng Chang Yong, and Yong Li all sold, but with the prediction of Indian silver shrinking by two annas, Ying Feng Heng and Ding Kang were still buying and the market was more bullish. Fu Yu and Da De Cheng sold off, falling to 4.1 yuan. Fu Xing Yong bought vigorously, rising to 5.7 yuan. Fu Yu and Shen Feng were still selling, retreating to 4.4 yuan. Fu Xing Yong, Yuan Sheng Yong, Yuan Mao Yong, Da Fa Yong, and Qian Chang Xiang re-entered and rose to 6.5 yuan. The noon closing was 926 yuan. After the close, Fu Yu, Da Da, and Yong Li sold off, once retreating within 5 yuan. Fu Xing Yong and Heng Xing vigorously entered, finally rising again to above 6 yuan.</p>
<p>The final price was the Central Bank's official standard gold price, which rose to 928.5 yuan. In terms of the closing price, it was about 2 yuan higher and 15 yuan weaker than the previous close. The November registered price was 920 yuan, and the December price was 926 yuan. The morning water supplement was 920 yuan. The price of red gold was reduced by 2 yuan to 918.3 yuan. Tianjin goods were increased by 1 yuan, and refined red was increased by 3 yuan, but there were no transactions. The spot premium was not small, and the spot price had to be cheaper. The spot trend was uncertain, and transactions were rare. Initially, short positions posted a premium of 6.23 yuan. Yong Feng, Fu Xing Yong, and Da De Cheng posted a premium, falling to 5.9 yuan. Heng Chang Yong, Da De Cheng, Shen Feng, Yi Feng, Yong Ying Feng Heng posted, gradually rising. Finally, Yi Cheng posted to Ying Feng Heng 7 times, actually rising to 6.7 yuan.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was still active. In summary, Fu Xing Yong, Heng Chang Yong, Heng Yu Sheng, Da Jia Tai, Da Chang Xiang, Yong Feng, Shun Mao, Yuan Chang Yong, Ri Chang, Shen Feng, Da Da, Tong Tai Chang, Yi Feng, Yong Hui Xiang, Wan Feng, and Qing Fa Yong were on the buying side. Da De Cheng, Li Feng, Yuan Mao Yong, Heng Yu, Chun Yuan Yong, Qian Chang Xiang, Shun Li, Wan Xing, Yong Li, Da Fa Yong, and Rui Xing were on the selling side. Heng Chang Yong and Shen Feng bought first and then sold. Ri Chang, Qian Chang Xiang, and Hui Xiang sold first and then bought. The Dalian group Wan Yu sold more than 100 times, Shunli sold less than 200, and the Guangdong groups Sheng Da and Heng Xing each bought more than 400 times.</p>
<p>Checking the market situation for half a day was quite firm. The morning opening was 920.3 yuan, and the noon closing was 926 yuan. The highest price was 926.5 yuan, and the lowest price was 917.7 yuan, with a fluctuation of 8.8 yuan. As a result, it beat the previous closing by 20.07 yuan. If the spot is removed, it rose by 14.75 yuan. The total number of transactions for the day was 43,413.</p>
<p>Those November contracts that have not yet been settled are even more scattered. The long positions include Heng Yu with more than 400, Yuan Da Yong and Hui Xiang with more than 200 each, and Yi Feng Yong, Tian Feng, Yi Sheng Yong, Heng Cheng Feng Yong with more than 100 each.

British currency rose by 375 against the US dollar, British currency rose by 3 pounds against the French franc, the US dollar rose by 125 against the French franc, and the US dollar rose by 375 against the British currency. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with a near-term selling price of 1 shilling and 6 pence 0625 for British currency, and 36.9375 yuan for US currency, compared to the previous closing, the British was tighter by 0.0625 and the US was tighter by 125. This is because the Chinese merchants are more bullish, and the Central Bank's official prices were announced, with British currency decreasing by 125 and US currency decreasing by 25, and the Customs Gold Unit rising by 1.2%. After the opening, the Jewish merchant Qiao Zhibu dumped forward shillings and was still loose, but the banks' buying appetite was quite strong and still easy to maintain. It was anticipated that the HSBC's official prices for British and American currencies would be flat. At this time, the banks' demand and supply were uneven, and the situation was uncertain. However, the process was extremely mediocre, and after wandering, the gold market was suddenly surrounded by buyers. Mobil Oil settled US dollars, causing the domestic market to gradually tighten. The prediction was that Indian silver would shrink by two annas. After tightening at noon, the foreign exchange market closed with a near-term selling price of 1 shilling and 6 pence for British currency, and 36.8125 yuan for US currency, compared to the previous closing, British currency was tighter by 125 and US currency was tighter by 25. Chinese merchants' buying and selling were uneven, and the settlement was average. The Jewish merchant Qiao Zhibu sold forward shillings, HSBC sold near-term, and Jiaotong and others bought. The transaction prices for half a day are recorded below.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Long-Term Loans Still Tight <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The current (i.e. the end of October) long-term funding, for various expiring long-term settlements, and the situation of new transactions, feels quite deserted. At this time when long-term loans are most needed, in previous years there would be at least three or four points of achievement that could be announced. Now, because banks and money shops are seeking to secure their own foundations, most are unwilling to indulge in indiscriminate lending, even a small transaction of one or two thousand must go through a serious investigation and require a reliable shop guarantee before it can be done. Otherwise, simply transferring the old loans that cannot be recovered is already a favor. It is naturally impossible to ask for new loans. Therefore, at present, ordinary shops, because their own economies are insufficient, have always relied on the financial community for long-term loans to help with turnover, but now they have nowhere to turn. According to yesterday's market situation, money shops did slightly open up a small number of long-term loans, but they were only small transactions of two or three thousand and five or six thousand, and there were no reports of transactions over 10,000. These small transactions all have considerable guarantees, and the interest rates are all above 9 yuan, with terms of six months and five months. The total amount is less than 100,000. As for long-term deposits that have expired, since the previous day (the 15th) has passed, those expiring on the 20th of this time are about 1 million. Although half of them have been transferred, the money shops feel it is difficult to return half of them and must wait until the due date to determine. This year's mainland gangs, such as Su, Xi, Chang, Song, Jia, He, Hang, and Hu, both deposits and loans have a long-term term. Yesterday, it was reported that most of the long-term deposits must be repaid, and most of the long-term loans owed may not be able to be repaid as desired. According to reliable news from the financial community, money shop peers are now privately setting long-term repayment methods. Those who truly cannot repay their debts should not be forced to do the impossible and should be allowed to transfer the debts, but the term cannot follow the old precedent (six months) and must be determined according to the situation, either three months or four months, so as not to harm the harmony of the business.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Securities　Old Bulls Emerge One After Another　The Bond Market's Decline Becomes More Severe <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>The Rise Was Only in the First Round　Ultimately Crushed by Short Positions Adding More</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange's market situation was turbulent and extremely volatile, with rapid changes that made people dizzy. The market price could not be raised after this kind of boost, which made the bulls even more disappointed. Rumors arose in the market, speculators were exhausted, the number 48 bull actually emerged, and the number 16 short continued to add more, which made people even more shocked. The number 47's large-scale selling was said to be emerging on behalf of others. Looking at the overall market situation, coupled with the lack of improvement in the environment, the future is still difficult to be optimistic about. Yesterday's process was extremely lively for buying customers at the opening, with a tendency to rise sharply, and the more it rose, the stronger it became. Although number 16 was actively selling among most of the customers, the market price still felt quite strong. After many days of fatigue and decline, this return wind may continue to rise. Unexpectedly, in the next round, number 16 tried its best to suppress the price, selling off its holdings as much as possible, and people's hearts were shocked. The budding rise was frustrated, and the market price fell across the board. The rise in the first round fell completely in the next round, and even exceeded it. The popularity was lost again. After the afternoon opening, the selling sentiment was even stronger. The 23rd custom and the Zhenglu crazily fell by 1.4 yuan, creating the lowest record. The closing disbandment also crazily fell by 1.35 yuan. After entering, it was slightly firmer, but it still did not feel like it was recovering. The market price ended with a decrease of small numbers of corners to 1.75 yuan. The total number of transactions was approximately 30 million yuan. The results of the rises and falls are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan).</p>

<p>The yarn market is trending strong, and a surge in prices has suddenly begun. This is mainly due to the soaring spot gold price. Rumors are rampant in the market, suggesting the resurgence of inflation.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton Prices: Spot Gold Closes at a Peak; Surge in Yarn Prices Resumes</p>
<p>Speculators are scrambling to cover their positions, and sentiment is high. The previously sluggish yarn market has suddenly become extremely active. Many parties are continuously increasing their positions, leading to a tightening market. In reality, cotton yarn sales have been quite brisk recently, and factory inventories have decreased significantly. Given favorable news, the upward pressure is even stronger.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Market Activities</p>
<p>In the morning, the spot yarn market opened with consistent gains across all months. Spot gold prices jumped wildly, and market rumors were rife, all favorable to the bullish side, completely reversing the previous day's artificial atmosphere. The opening gains were moderate, but the market gradually tightened after the second session. News from Osaka's Sanpin yarn exchange initially showed a decline, followed by a rebound. By the close, retail investors, seeing improving conditions, actively covered their positions, resulting in gains ranging from 90 cents to $1.10 or $1.20 across all months compared to the previous day's close. Upon the afternoon opening, news of spot gold closing at a peak and rising prices at Osaka's Sanpin yarn exchange further boosted market sentiment, with particularly strong buying interest. The market situation eased slightly after the second session. By the close, spot yarn trading was reported to be weak, with nearby months seeing larger declines. As a result, all months rose by $1.20, $1.30, or $1.40 compared to the morning close. Reported sales included 400 bales of Mei Kee yarn, 400 bales of Tu Fu yarn, 1,100 bales of Feng Yi yarn, 800 bales of Da Fu yarn, 450 bales of Yong Chang yarn, 350 bales of Jin Chang yarn, 350 bales of Sen Kang yarn, 850 bales of Chang Feng yarn, and 450 bales of Yong Da yarn. Buyers included 300 bales of Da Fu yarn, 650 bales of Tai Yu yarn, 400 bales (assumed) of Ren Feng yarn, 1,000 bales of Jian Kang yarn, 400 bales of Xin Cheng yarn, 950 bales of Da Ji yarn, 400 bales of Yi Chang yarn, and 550 bales of Tong He yarn. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Sluggish Spot Yarn Sales</p>
<p>A total of 543 bales were reportedly purchased by various dealers today, with prices rising by 50 cents. The purchase amounts for each dealer are listed below:</p>
<p>Changsha 55</p>
<p>Guangdong 120</p>
<p>Jiangxi 10</p>
<p>Ningbo 15</p>
<p>Xiamen 15</p>

<p>Shantou 45</p>
<p>Xuzhou 3</p>
<p>Anqing 5</p>
<p>Fujian 5</p>
<p>Yunnan 70</p>
<p>The cotton market is showing even stronger gains, and the trading floor feels particularly lively. This is due to rising spot gold prices, exchange rate fluctuations, and the strength of the American and Indian cotton markets. News reports indicate that the Bank of China plans to issue an additional 50 million yuan in Shanghai currency, further fueling market speculation. Speculators are actively buying, causing prices to rise steadily.</p>
<p>Active Spot Cotton Buying</p>
<p>The spot cotton market opened in the morning with gains across all months, and buying interest was particularly strong. The trading floor lacked supply because the previous day, many retail investors had been misled by rumors and panic, leading them to aggressively sell short in large quantities. Yesterday's situation was the opposite, with spot gold prices rising sharply, and American cotton also stabilizing and rising by 5 pounds. As a result, buyers gathered, and prices rose steadily. All months closed up by 25 to 45 cents compared to the previous day's close. The afternoon opening saw news of spot gold closing at a peak and rising prices at Osaka's Sanpin cotton exchange, further boosting the market. However, some profit-takers emerged after the second and third sessions, leading to a slight retracement. Nearby months closed up by 5 to 20 cents compared to the morning close, while distant months remained flat. Reported sales included 1,500 bales of Da Fu cotton, 1,100 bales of Yuan Yi cotton, 700 bales of Sen Kang cotton, 1,200 bales of Xie Cheng cotton, 1,800 bales of Tong He cotton, 1,100 bales of Xin Heng cotton, 2,600 bales of Sheng Yuan cotton, and 2,200 bales of Yong Da cotton. Buyers included 2,200 bales of Jian Kang cotton, 900 bales of Tong Fu cotton, 800 bales of He Xing cotton, 900 bales of Gu Da cotton, 2,100 bales of Sheng Yuan cotton, 2,200 bales of Xin Cheng cotton, 2,500 bales of Yi Kang cotton, 1,700 bales of Chang He cotton, 1,800 bales (assumed) of Yuan Da cotton, 1,900 bales of Da Feng cotton, 800 bales of Da Fu cotton, 900 bales of Sen Kang (assumed) cotton, 1,200 bales of Yi Cheng cotton, and 1,300 bales of Yi Chang cotton.

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with sluggish trading. Favorable news from Liverpool prompted Far Eastern and Liverpool traders to buy, with gains of 3 to 5 pounds across all months. Hedge selling was normal, and there was little trading from outside the industry. Traders are awaiting developments, and the weather remains favorable. Spot cotton prices are firm due to demand from factories and exporters. Subsequently, hedge selling increased, and prices retreated. As a result, spot prices rose by 5 pounds, while futures rose by 1 to 3 pounds. British spot cotton fell by 4 points, and futures fell by 1 to 2 points. Indian cotton was sold by Japanese traders but was overturned by large-scale buying by speculators. Pingle rose by 1.5 rupees, Omra rose by 0.5 rupees, and Bai Luoxi rose by 0.25 rupees.

<p>The flour market opened in the morning with a sharp rise, followed by a return to flat. Foreign quotations showed Chicago up by 3 to 5 cents, and Canada up by 2 to 3. Market sentiment was initially buoyant due to rising foreign wheat prices and persistent inflation rumors, leading to strong buying interest. Prices rose by 1 to 2 cents across all months. Subsequently, buying interest waned, and inflation rumors subsided, causing the market to return to flat. In the afternoon, trading was lighter, and the market saw a lack of development in buying and selling due to the international situation remaining serious and rumors circulating about domestic political issues.</p>

<p>The wheat futures market saw stable conditions across all months after opening in the morning. Although trading was not brisk, sentiment was positive due to rising foreign wheat prices by 2 to 35 cents. Nearby months saw continued gains of 2 to 3 cents, while distant months remained largely unchanged. However, the afternoon opening saw a decline of 3 to 5 cents across all nearby and distant months due to the tightening and softening of the flour market and prevalent political rumors. According to industry insiders, if foreign wheat prices approach parity, sentiment should gradually ease. Otherwise, the footing will remain firm and is not expected to loosen excessively. The spot wheat market remains expensive, with high-quality Danyang wheat priced at $4.45. Mid-grade wheat is also selling well, with Dongtai Gaoyou wheat priced at $4.42 and Hankou wheat at $4.35. It is estimated that 5,000 bags were handled by Fu Xin.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, over 30 boats arrived from various regions (carrying nearly 7,000 loads). With the weather clearing, sentiment turned sluggish. The opening market saw price drops of 10 to 20 cents for each category. Sales of thinly packaged rice were only 300 to 400 bags, also down 20 to 30 cents. Kiln-grown rice dropped by a few cents, high-quality Xin Jing rice dropped by 10 cents, and Du Yang and other types of new rice also dropped by a few cents. Old and new rice remained weak.</p>

<p>Market Sentiment is Unusually Bullish</p>
<p>Since silk prices in New York and Yokohama have been rising frequently, Lyon has also been purchasing goods at new high prices. Recently, overseas orders have been quite active. Due to insufficient supply in the ports, silk prices are also trending towards peaks. Amidst the sluggishness of various industries, the silk market appears to have further upside potential. Unfortunately, the raw material supply is insufficient, preventing us from maximizing sales. Yesterday, Ren Ji and Mitsui competed for over 300 bales of white factory silk, with unusually high prices reported.</p>

<p>Selling at Half the Price is Inappropriate</p>
<p>Since the closure of foreign firms in Hankou, the market for white tung oil has become precarious. New oil has arrived in Shanghai, with prices opening at $45 per load, a drop of around $40 compared to old oil, selling at half the price. This is an unprecedented situation. Futures opened at $40, but foreign firms are not eager to take spot oil, so there is no distinction between futures and spot prices. Foreign firms have sent telegrams to Europe and America for inquiries, but there have been no replies. The overseas market has experienced a slight pause, and the market's decline is within expectations. The peak season for new oil is approaching, and a price of $40 may not be sustainable.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw rising prices for all sugar types, including green, red, and white sugar. With the customs gold standard rebounding, having been at 1.826, the trend tightened. The association set the opening price for spot No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar at $17.70, with some transactions. Later, the asking price rose to $17.75, and the asking price for re-export goods was $5.70, but no transactions occurred. East Red NKC was bid at $13.80, but no transactions occurred. No. 8 East White was at $17.65, and re-export goods were $5.60, both with transactions. No. 9 was at $17.60, and re-export goods were $5.60, but no transactions occurred, up by 5 cents. Zhen Ji No. 1 refined white sugar from the local factory was at $16.90, up by 10 cents. Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5 remained unchanged. The Sugar Cooperative Company's bid for 550 bags of Five Sheep Yue coarse white sugar was $17.75, up by 10 cents. Also, 404 bags of Dutch coarse white sugar were sold at the full price, and the bid for Guangdong refined white sugar rose by 10 cents, but no transactions occurred. Locally produced Chaoqing new arrivals were bid at $11.50, and refined red sugar was bid at $13.50, but no transactions occurred. The trend is firm.</p>

<h3 id="e183">Impressions of the National Woodcut Exhibition <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>By now, probably no one would doubt the artistic status of woodcuts. But just two or three years ago, they were being scorned by great painters or great talkers, just like the current essays, as unworthy of entering the art world. But what is the situation now? Thanks to the efforts of several young artists, woodcut painting has regained its head, not only progressing but also becoming widespread and powerful, becoming the vanguard of popular art, enough to tear down the sacred banner of art-for-art's-sakeists and add a bit of life to the silent art scene.</p>
<p>For this reason, I was very happy to visit this National Woodcut Exhibition.</p>
<p>This joint exhibition was first held in Beiping, then Tianjin, Jinan, Hankou, and Taiyuan. This is the sixth time, in Shanghai. As an amateur and a casual browser, I still found it interesting, which shows how deeply touching the woodcuts are.</p>
<p>In addition to modern woodcuts, the exhibition also includes displays of ancient prints, folk New Year pictures, woodcut tools, etc., totaling over 700 pieces. The ancient prints are mostly Ming editions, but there are also Song, Yuan, and Jin works, mostly illustrations from Buddhist scriptures and folk novels. The New Year pictures are mostly from Wang Mazi of Beiping, which are also the best.</p>
<p>But the main thing, of course, is the modern woodcuts. Although the works in this section are immature, they are relatively clear, energetic, and closely related to real life. Ancient prints are neither as profound, nor are folk New Year pictures as lively. This is truly a valuable harvest for the Chinese art world in the past two or three years.</p>
<p>These works include originals and imitations of world masterpieces. For example, Li Hua's "Angry Horse" and Lai Shaoqi's "Youth" are two very successful imitations. In terms of original works, the most noteworthy are many works by Yefu. This writer's achievements are very consistent, and the selection of subjects seems to have been carefully considered, such as "The First Sound of Construction," "The Road is Like a Tiger's Mouth," and "Funeral Procession." As for "Flood," "Big Belly Salt" (see this publication), and "Sadness," although they are drawn from serial comics, the exquisite carving, the powerful imagery, and the skilled technique all indicate that he is a very promising woodcut artist.</p>
<p>Luo Qingzhen's early works are quite capable of combining the strengths of Yefu, but he seems to be changing his style now. He has changed from using large knives and axes to fine needles and dense threads, which seems to be a bit weaker in terms of strength. However, his "Cow" and "Returning from Pasture" are still rare.</p>
<p>In addition, Zhang Wang's "Beggar," XXX's "Same Face," Chen Baozhen's "Strength," Duan Ganqing's "Two Hands," Dai Yinlang's "Staring Eyes," Yu Tao's "Debt Collection," Wo XXX's "Meal in the Field," Wang Xingshuan's "Begging," and Zhang Hui's "Busy Farming" and "The Future is Bright" are all very vigorous and interesting, and are undoubtedly excellent works.</p>
<p>Looking at this woodcut exhibition, I think the most successful thing is the facial expressions of the characters. Almost every artist pays attention to this. Not to mention "Staring Eyes," "Same Face," etc., even several portraits, such as Duan Ganqing's portrait of Gandhi, Yang Tian's portrait of Barbusse, and Deng Qing's portrait, etc., are probably taken from photographs, but they are all very realistic and vivid.</p>
<p>What is even more rare are Yefu's two brick books, which is a new attempt. Brick carvings are more economical than woodcuts. Judging from the current achievements, the great and bright future can be predicted.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to mention serial comics. If my memory is correct, then it seems that only Xu Lunyin's "Before Sunrise" is a complete serial comic in this exhibition, which is about the experiences of a primary school teacher. Mr. Xu and Mr. Jin Jingye were the earliest initiators of the National Woodcut Joint Exhibition. Now Mr. Jin has brought these works to the eyes of the Shanghai people, but Mr. Xu quietly left this world a few weeks ago. I really mourn for him.</p>
<p>Although Chinese woodcut painting originated the earliest, it has always been despised and suppressed, and it has almost declined to the point where it is invisible. Now, to compare this little bit of achievement with countries such as Germany, France, England, and the Soviet Union, it is certainly very immature. Because we really don't have Frans Masereel, Meffert, Conatant Le Breton, Pamela'dA．Nalhan, N．I．Piskarev, and V．Konashevich. However, we already have efforts, and flowers blooming from these efforts. We expect them to be bright, beautiful, and lush.</p>
<p>This is a hope I have after seeing the National Woodcut Joint Exhibition.</p>
<h3 id="e184">A Certain Night (Part 1) <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Cun</p>
<p>Just as darkness and light are two opposite contrasts, night and day are also completely different. In the dark night, you cannot see the clear sky and the flying white clouds as you can in the daytime; all that is presented before you is a dim sky and sparse stars; at night, you cannot see the road ahead as clearly as you can in the daytime, and the range of your vision is only a limited area of shadows. The streetlights make the night extra dull. The bustling scene of the daytime is completely transformed into calmness at night. Yes, the roads at night stretch out with a quiet solitude everywhere.</p>
<p>At that time, because of my work, I had to walk along a long, snake-like road every night. The time was always around midnight. The streets at that time were really quiet, with no one around, only the flickering shadows and heavy footsteps closely accompanying my loneliness. And sometimes, due to a sudden gust of wind, one or two fallen leaves would fly down from above, quietly gliding onto the road without a sound. Speaking of which, the roads in autumn are never short of fallen leaves.</p>
<p>Walking alone on a quiet road is very meaningful. At that time, the sense of hearing is the most acute. Even the smallest sounds in the distance, like the sound of sweeping the floor and the sound of shop signs fluttering, can be heard very clearly. Not to mention the sound of car horns and factory motors, which are even clearer.</p>
<p>One night, at the same time, I was walking on the road again as usual, preparing to return to my pigeon-nest-like room to rest for the night. When I was less than halfway there, I seemed to hear someone shouting nearby. At first, I couldn't make out the words, but later I heard them clearly.</p>
<p>"Selling children—who—wants to buy—children?"</p>
<p>The sound was drawn out for a long time, which clearly suggested to me that the person shouting must not have had enough energy, and from that weak sound, I could guess that there seemed to be some kind of embarrassing hidden pain in it.</p>
<p>I remembered something. In the past few days, haven't I been seeing some shocking news in the newspaper every day? Those news were all published on the front page of the newspaper with large headlines, water, water, that is to say, floods, from south to north, from east to west, almost the entire country was covered with floodwaters. And every time I saw those continuously published flood reports, it often aroused a sense of sadness and grief. At that time, I was sad for the victims on the one hand, and on the other hand, I naturally thought of the neglect of river conservancy projects. The newspaper also said that some victims had come to Shanghai. I heard that the local authorities were trying to disperse them far away in order to prevent accidents and create trouble. But where were they going, I thought at the time, wasn't there water everywhere?</p>
<p>Therefore, it made me think that perhaps the victims were crying out in pain! They had no home, and it was natural for them to spend the night on the road; they had no money, but they couldn't help but eat, so they could only sell their children to find a solution. This would not only allow them to eat a few more meals, but would it also reduce their burden? However, children are ultimately their flesh and blood, so they are still somewhat reluctant, which makes their throats not very comfortable when shouting; they certainly hope to find a buyer for their children, but they are also hoping that their children will not be sold!</p>
<p>"Selling children—who—wants to buy—children?"</p>
<p>The second shout came out again, and I happened to walk in front of them at this time. Outside the wall of a Western-style building, in a place where they could avoid the wind, three people were lying there. The light of the street lamps was able to reflect their three gray faces. The man and woman were middle-aged, probably husband and wife, and the child, with a snotty face, was about four or five years old, naturally their child. They were all wearing clothes that were even worse than rags, and it was difficult to resist the cold of the night, and they were all shivering. They huddled together for warmth. I wasn't wrong, they were indeed refugees. The man gave me an unexpected and pitiful look, glanced over me, and then opened his mouth:</p>
<p>"Sir, do a good deed, buy the child, okay?"</p>
<p>I stood there blankly, without speaking. I didn't know what to say. Were they really three people? They were almost three skeletons. Their appearance of having no way forward and sitting and waiting for death was somewhat like cows and pigs being led into a slaughterhouse. Their life and death were in the hands of others. The woman took advantage of my silence and added in a hoarse voice:</p>
<p>"Sir, there's no way, the water in the house, alas, the water flooded it. The house, the fields, all flooded. There's no way. Sir, please do a good deed and buy the child."</p>
<h3 id="e185">Remembering the Summer in Bōsō <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Xiangshan</p>
<p>Summer, the sea breeze brings the aroma of ripe fruit, mixed with the fresh scent of seaweed. What a vast and vibrant atmosphere!</p>
<p>Cotton-like clouds pile up in the melancholic sky. Gray seagulls glide along the coast, tracing arcs and net-like shapes in the sky. This leisurely soaring and dancing inspires and guides those weary of travel and burdened with sorrow.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Bay, nestled between the Bōsō Peninsula and the Miura Peninsula, stretches flatly beneath the sky, breeding countless seeds of imagination and contemplation. And the boundless Pacific Ocean, at the tip of the peninsula, seems to have witnessed millions of years of cosmic history without feeling a thing, relentlessly crashing wave after wave against the lighthouse standing tall in the azure sky.</p>
<p>Since moving to Hōjō on the Bōsō Peninsula, I have shifted my world-weary gaze to the vast sea and the green mountains winding along the peninsula. When the sea breeze passes through the green cypress forest along the coast, it lightly climbs over the lush rice paddies and rushes into the thick hills, emitting a loud and startling sound that pierces the heavens and the earth. At this moment, the sparrows perched on the ridge of the shrine on the hillside scatter in a flurry, like sesame seeds scattered across the sky. And the chirping noise, along with the tearing sound of the shrine's large flag ripped halfway by the wind, shatters the caretaker's sweet dreams under the eaves.</p>
<p>Ah, the sea is magnificent and indifferent! Relying on this boundless sea, I reflect on my own trivial daily life and truly feel small and ashamed.</p>
<p>In the morning, before the village path hears any footsteps, I open the window and wander in the small courtyard of eight square feet. The clear dew clings to the long sleeves of my kimono. This dew is as clear as tears, like what soaks the pillow and sleeves after waking from a dream of farewell.</p>
<p>When drawing clear, cold water from the well covered with morning glories to wash my face, I can't help but recite the haiku by Kaga no Chiyo:</p>
<p>"Morning glories twine</p>
<p>around the bucket. For you,</p>
<p>I borrow well water</p>
<p>from my neighbor."</p>
<p>From this haiku, one can feel a woman's gentle nature. Unable to bear plucking the morning glories twining around the bucket, she cannot draw water and has to borrow it from a neighbor. This love for living things is what I yearn for! But this is only a thing of the past!</p>
<p>When the white sun spreads golden light across the universe, I climb Castle Mountain in Nishihama and look down. The white sandy beach is quietly lapped by the seawater. The colorful swimsuits, worn by children, are like wildflowers of red, green, and yellow, scattered on the beach. And the straw hats placed on the rocks, like forgotten embers fading away, lazily lie dormant. Here and there, parasols, like poisonous mushrooms after rain, are scattered. At this time, twenty or thirty fishermen and fisherwomen are hauling in fishing nets in the distance. The water droplets falling from the nets reflect the sunlight, sparkling with five colors. A rhythmic chorus of folk songs rises. In the sea, a sailboat, full of sea breeze, carries a boatload of sunlight, crushing the golden waves and speeding away.</p>
<p>Looking at this seaside scenery, I am reminded of the short story "At the Bay" by the beautiful English writer Katherine Mansfield. Although this bay is not a Crescent Bay, doesn't her delicate writing fit the Tateyama Bay below?</p>
<p>Just as I was lost in thought, the call of a mountain bird suddenly rang out from the pine tree I was leaning against.</p>
<p>Ah! The sea is full of joy and happiness, making people forget all the hardships of life, sinking into a state of oblivion like a dream—when half-asleep on the armrest. When the village rooster crows its long midday announcement, the old people in the seaside village are struggling to keep their heavy eyelids open under the grape trellis.</p>
<p>At this time, only the bright sunlight and the sound of cicadas in the bushes, like oil being cut, fill the heavens and the earth. And from this noisy sound, I can feel the troubles of reality and at the same time realize a state of silence. Is the soul always tormented by this noisy reality? Or is it silently resisting? At this moment, a summer cloud covers the gingko tree, and a sorrowful expression and shadow appear on the delicate lily petals. Although the lily is planted in the shade of the large leaves of the Fatsia japonica, it is afraid of the threat of the approaching summer rain, feeling the same trembling and absent-mindedness!</p>
<p>I worry, I feel the terror of suffocation. A cool breeze blows from the sea, bringing the laughter and songs of young people on the beach, but I feel my heart is even more stirred up. When the wind chime hanging under the eaves rings with a clear sound, I look up at the sky. A seagull soars across the sky, leaving an image of freedom in my eyes. At this time, the distant mountains and nearby hills are lush, as if steamed and burst open. When I look around again at the quiet state of the small courtyard and my own peacefulness leaning on the armrest, I feel an indescribable taste.</p>
<p>'Lying down, leisurely watching the floating clouds, in the summer room.'</p>
<p>This haiku by Shida Noe describes the behavior of a poet gazing at the free and pure clouds in a comfortable room full of greenery. What a transcendent realm! Alas! Let my eyes close! I fall asleep in an ignorant dream, letting the murmuring sound of the Shiomi River flow by the traveler's pillow.</p>
<p>When I wake up, darkness sweeps over from the other side of the sea. The mountains are green and dim in the dusk, and a haze rises from the water's edge, making it difficult to distinguish. In the distance, the sound of the village's Bon dance drums fills my ears, and the seaside theater also plays music to attract customers. When I look up at the western corner of the house, a blood-red sunset hangs on top of the fire lookout tower.</p>
<p>Night has arrived, and the sea's moisture penetrates the bones. The landlord's child claps his small hands and points to the inky black sky, slowly singing a nursery rhyme:</p>
<p>One star seen,</p>
<p>Beside the clouds yo!</p>
<p>Two stars seen,</p>
<p>In…</p>
<p>………………</p>

<h3 id="e187">Honorable Old Woman (9) <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Ema Shū, Translated by Ren Jun</p>
<p>In my house, everyone gathered around and comforted the old woman. Aside from saying that although this was undoubtedly a sad thing, it was actually a very honorable thing, there was no other way to comfort her. In particular, my mother also talked about the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo; she earnestly told her that the war dead were enshrined there, and that there were grand festivals twice a year, and that no matter how noble people were, they had to go there to worship.</p>
<p>While my mother was speaking, the old woman became calmer. And, just as if she were listening to a rare sermon, while constantly shedding tears, she deeply nodded to every word, listening as if she were very satisfied.</p>
<p>"From what you say," she said, sniffing, "it really makes me feel very unworthy. Now, I really understand what honor is all about. Thank you. It's really an honor, honor! I'm going to go back and tell my husband properly. Even so, but... that Yuzo..."</p>
<p>Speaking of Yuzo, she burst into tears again. My mother tried to persuade her with various words, and then asked the shopkeeper to accompany her and take her home.</p>
<p>According to later, more detailed reports, Yuzo died in the terrible attack on 203 Hill. He had always been admired for his bravery and boldness. That day, he also stood at the head of the assault team in the hail of bullets. When he fell, his body had already been hit by twenty-three bullets. Moreover, after people moved him into the tent, he survived for another ten hours.</p>
<p>He was immediately promoted to corporal, and because of his outstanding achievements, he also received the Golden Kite Medal, Sixth Class of Merit. A corporal with the Sixth Class of Merit was really an exceptional thing. There were very few precedents. And a consolation payment of three hundred taels was also issued.</p>
<p>The cooking old woman was very proud and unusually elated.</p>
<p>"How about that, Sixth Class of Merit, huh! He's a Corporal. Even the town elder can't match my son. Congratulations, congratulations, what could be more honorable and happier than this!"</p>
<p>Then she ran up to my mother and said:</p>
<p>"Look, madam! I can get three hundred dollars, I'm just completely dreaming. Think about it, three hundred taels, that's no small amount of money. We haven't seen such a large sum of money in our lives, thinking about it makes my head spin. Even so, but I've almost become a rich person!"</p>
<p>"It really is a good thing," my mother replied, "that's because you have an able son. Don't you see, the people in the town are all admiring you. They're all saying, 'This is not only your personal honor, but also the honor of everyone in the town.'"</p>
<p>The old woman cried with joy, her eyes full of tears.</p>
<p>"Thinking about it, my son is really pitiful; but I also feel that he really died well. Although the person is dead, the soul is still there; being worshiped by people in the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, he won't have any dissatisfaction. As the old saying goes: 'Life is only for one lifetime, but reputation lasts for a thousand years.'"</p>
<p>"Of course. Even so, the government is really kind and very grateful."</p>

<p>Hubei and Shanghai Meet Yesterday</p>
<p>The much-anticipated small ball demonstration was held at the stadium yesterday afternoon at three o'clock. The players from Hubei Province had all been through hundreds of battles. Jiang Chao was agile, Shao Yougong steady, Huang Jingui lively, Fu Zhibin fierce, and Huang Guorong exquisite. The players were connected throughout, forming a perfect whole. Shanghai's mixed team had Tang Zuolin and Shen Longzhang guarding the iron gate, with Yu Qiaxing and Yu Chuhua on both sides, and Zhang Jinhai and Cao Qinfang as the front line, supplemented by Shen Jinda and Li Zushou, like a tiger with wings added. The team's fighting power was also very strong. The two sides competed fiercely, with countless highlights. The entire audience cheered. To find out the winner and loser, please read the sports news in today's Shen Bao.</p>
<p>According to reports, the balls used in the demonstration were Yongzi brand balls approved by the Shanghai Small Ball Association, produced by Yonghe Industrial Company, and can be considered standard balls.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Chinese People Should Have Self-Confidence <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Yang'an</p>
<p>National products today, finally have had some success, except for those who generally believe in foreign goods, deliberately unwilling to love the country, not to mention that Chinese people like Chinese goods, Chinese people use Chinese goods, measure recently many foreigners, also value Chinese goods very much, very happy to use Chinese goods. The other day at a Rotary Club meeting, American Commercial Counselor Arno said in a speech: "How to Promote China's Foreign Trade" he said: China, if it wants to promote foreign trade, the first task is to make everyone have self-confidence, but also to concentrate everyone's thoughts and talents, and then Chinese goods will have a way out. A few months ago, a few American economic missions toured Guangzhou, at the Chamber of Commerce meeting, a certain member requested Americans to use more Chinese tea, but a few hours ago, when the local banking community held a banquet for the mission members at a hotel set up by a large Chinese, the tea used was not Chinese tea leaves, but authentic imports. And also added milk, which is very contrary to the traditional Chinese habit of drinking tea without mixing in other items, so as not to mess up the taste. Originally, Chinese businessmen, or other sectors, when receiving foreign guests, or even when they are interacting with each other, often like to use foreign tea, which is not considered a strange thing. Sometimes even in the Chinese government-run trains and large hotels and restaurants, it is not possible to taste Chinese tea. Therefore, the economic mission members once advised the Chinese hosts: it is best to ask the Chinese people to use Chinese tea first, so that Chinese tea can be popularized first in China, and then come to advise others, by analogy, we can know that to expand international trade, we must start from our own country. Mr. An's words are very profound. The reporter felt very ashamed after listening to it. Recently, the International Trade Bureau often receives commissions from foreign companies to use domestic products, some are willing to make honest publicity or sales for Chinese goods, some are willing to make free display or exhibition for Chinese goods. Especially worthy of rejoicing and glory is that the Shanghai Electric Power Company on Nanjing Road in Shanghai completely displays the light bulbs produced by Ya'pu'er in the windows along the road, and also praises their brightness and power saving, which can not help but make people feel a little strange. Everyone knows that the Shanghai Electric Power Company is a foreign company, and it has always been said that it is unwilling to display anything other than imports. Ya'pu'er light bulbs are Chinese goods, why are foreign companies using Chinese goods? Because foreign companies have very good eyes and think that this kind of goods is worth using, it is not said that foreign companies advocate it, and then think that our national goods have ten times the price. It must be known that as long as you can do any business down to earth, once you have made achievements, you can naturally arouse people's belief and praise, but first you must have self-confidence, sooner or later you can make people very satisfied. Ya'pu'er Factory is just an example.</p>

The national goods factories regard the female athletes as the mothers of the nation, and today Xiao's national strength is greatly attributed to the female compatriots. In order to encourage the female compatriots to pay attention to sports, there is a congratulatory meeting. The reporter believes that the task of female athletes is not only to engage in sports, and pay attention to physical education, all female athletes are excellent members of various places, and are leaders of the student community in various places. If they can take the lead in using national goods in various places, and vow to be powerful promoters for the national goods industry, and hold the ambition that no national goods will not be used, to make a sound for the quiet student national goods year, to open up the new road for the national goods industry. Then the glory of the gentlemen in the sports world is great, and the benefits for the national goods industry are even greater. The reporter recites one more word to give to the gentlemen.</p>
<p>Heroines are passionate, and they are concerned about the country's products. Today, we share a welcome banquet, and we predict a successful industrial success.</p>
<h3 id="e191">The All-China Games and National Goods <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Bai</p>
<p>On Double Tenth Day, the Sixth National Games officially opened amidst the enthusiastic emotions of more than 100,000 spectators. We naturally felt that China's future was very promising and that national rejuvenation and national prosperity were in our hands when we saw such a grand and unprecedented event that day. Now, from the opening of the conference to today, it has been seven days quickly. In addition to congratulating them on their particularly successful achievements, we also want to offer some hope for the prosperity of the national economy and the future of the entire industry to all the athletes and hundreds of thousands of spectators at the conference.</p>
<p>I deeply feel that the holding of this All-China Games is closely related to the promotion of national goods. Everyone knows that this year is the Student National Goods Year, which is a year of national goods with students as the main body, and everyone is moving forward together. In this All-China Games, it is also based on students from various places. Therefore, I think that if they can exert some effectiveness in promoting national goods and everyone is willing to do a little bit, then its benefits to the future of national goods will certainly be great. Now, I dare to write out my two enthusiastic hopes for the All-China Games.</p>
<p>First, athletes and spectators in the conference should strive to use national goods: around the venue, according to my visit, I can also see temporary markets of several national goods factories, but there are also many stores that specialize in selling foreign goods, especially for food and beverages. I have seen many imported sodas, beers, breads, and big dishes, which makes me feel that it is a big mistake to do a lot of promotion for foreign goods because of such a glorious conference. Therefore, I sincerely hope that all the spectators and athletes of the conference should do their best to use national goods for all consumption in the venue, in order to fulfill their national duties as citizens.</p>
<p>Second, it is necessary for the national goods industry to have a group to implement official publicity at the conference: the audience of this conference is certainly very lively and crowded. Usually, the number of people per day is about 100,000. The conference is held for ten days, and the total number of people may be more than hundreds of thousands. In such a huge event, I feel that the national goods industry is very necessary to carry out group publicity. In my opinion, it is best to jointly print some small booklets or leaflets that introduce national goods by many national goods factories, companies, etc., and distribute them to the audience of the conference. This must be a very meaningful and valuable work.</p>
<p>In addition, such as the national goods industry's reception of the athletes of the conference, and the arrangement of national goods slogans and stakes around the venue, are also very necessary. In short, the national goods movement is as urgent a problem for our survival as the sports movement. Everyone needs to work hard and promote its success.</p>
<h3 id="e192">A Word to National Goods Manufacturers <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>In this voice of advocating national goods, national goods factories are springing up like mushrooms after the rain, which is also an excellent phenomenon. However, all factories always feel that their own strength is weak and they cannot compete with foreigners; and the goods cannot be sold well, and there is always a sigh of "difficult to continue in the future." Therefore, some say that the world is in recession, so it is like this; others say that the people of our country are too unpatriotic and unwilling to buy national goods. These two points may be somewhat related, but they cannot be regarded as the biggest crux of why national goods cannot be sold well. I think that "things must rot from within, and then insects will grow." The failure of goods to sell, and the lack of protection by the people of our country, must also have something questionable in themselves. Otherwise, people are not Uncle Shi, how can they recognize a thief as their father! I think that the two biggest and most important problems of national goods factories at present are "unsound economy" and unsound organization," so there are many shortcomings that follow. Now I will discuss these two points separately:</p>
<p>What does it mean to have an unsound economy? This point is easy to understand. For example, a factory, if it wants to organize well, must have a minimum of 100,000 yuan, but the initiators and supporters cannot come up with so much capital; and Chinese people are not very willing to invest in industry, so it is not easy to raise shares; then they have to borrow from relatives and friends, 10,000 yuan is good, 20,000 yuan is good, and then open the factory. Of course, various equipment is simple; therefore, the goods cannot be improved. If there is no storm attack, it can barely get by; once foreign businessmen compete, there is a danger of being unsafe in the morning and evening. This is an unsound economy, which is the first major shortcoming of our national goods manufacturers.</p>
<p>What does it mean to have an unsound organization? This comes from the unsound economy. A factory, because of insufficient capital, cannot hire outstanding talents to handle everything, then the organization will naturally present chaos and incoherence. Moreover, because of the capital relationship, this major shareholder introduces a technician? Another major shareholder introduces an accountant, which is really because of face, and they have to let them fill the numbers, how can there be good results? Therefore, a factory with an unsound organization will also lead to backward productivity and depletion of property, which is the second shortcoming of our national goods factories.</p>
<p>I hope that the national goods manufacturers who are enthusiastic about national goods will work hard on the one hand; on the other hand, they must also eliminate these two shortcomings.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Thinking of the Feet of the Athletes from the All-China Games <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>Autumn is high and horses are fat! Thousands of athletes gather together, each showing their unique skills, raising their palms high and leaping far! How magnificent! Therefore, the writer thinks of the feet of the athletes, are they wearing national goods running shoes, ball shoes? Or mostly non-national goods? By extension, there is a need to examine and reflect on sports shirts and sports pants!</p>
<p>Athletes, you devote yourselves to sports, you are the pillars of the country! You are the key to reviving the nation! Then from top to toe, pay attention to your feet, in order to benefit the development of the national goods industry! This is especially important.</p>
<p>"In the past, Duke Wen of Jin missed Jie Zhitui, who had contributed to the country's revival, but Zhitui had already died hugging a tree! Duke Wen wore wooden clogs to commemorate him, and often cried out, 'Your feet!'," this story is worth changing and learning from. In today's China, where the people are poor and the treasury is empty, the athletes are the driving force for national revival. The sports shoes under your feet, as well as the clothes and shoes you usually use, should be national goods without hesitation. Although Chen Jiageng Company unfortunately gave us a painful history! But the Warrior brand ball shoes of Zhengtai Factory, Guangdong Brothers Factory, the running shoes of Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory, and the products of many rubber factories, still provide us with extremely satisfactory choices.</p>
<p>Athletes! Get up! The responsibility of promoting national goods and recovering rights and interests rests on all of you brothers and sisters.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Fudan's 30th Anniversary National Products Exhibition <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Qiao Yunsun</p>
<p>—Observations and Other Matters—</p>
<p>Jiangwan Fudan University is a leading private university. It was established before the founding of the Republic of China, splitting off from Aurora University. At that time, the school was headed by Mr. Ma Xiangbo, a senior figure in education known as the "Ninety-Six Old Man." It has now been 30 years since then. According to the words of ancient Chinese sages, "Thirty years is one generation." It has thus passed through one generation. While it is common in Europe and America to see universities with two or three hundred years of history, in China, the pursuit of fame and wealth through the imperial examination system has hindered the advancement of modern education. A university with such a long history is worth celebrating and is quite rare. According to public opinion, their business school has earned quite a reputation, and their journalism department has also achieved remarkable results. Earlier this month, they celebrated their 30th anniversary. In addition to holding a grand ceremony, each department held academic achievement exhibitions. I first made a general tour and then specifically visited the National Products and Industrial Exhibition. University education is originally a source of economic prosperity and national salvation, and business schools are even more responsible for spreading the seeds of prosperity for the people. Regarding the various academic exhibitions, they have collected a great deal of material, providing insights for visitors to study. The National Products and Industrial Exhibition consists of six rooms, featuring companies such as Tianchu MSG Factory, Family Industrial Cooperative, and Central Chemical Glass Factory, among others. Among them, the Xinsheng Chemical Factory is a testing ground founded by their alumni. We know that no matter how brilliant the insights, if they are only theoretical, they will not be practical. The reason why China's national economy has declined to this point is that there is too much talk and too little action. Fudan graduates are actually able to apply what they have learned. Although Xinsheng is not a well-known industrial institution, it is able to break the old record of "it cannot be put into practice," which is very worthy of praise. Isn't it like guaranteeing a wife and raising a son? The exhibits this time include sporting goods, stationery, cosmetics, medical supplies, and daily necessities. Each manufacturer has a representative to greet visitors, and transactions are also being conducted. It seems that these displays can cater to the tastes of university students. However, every time there is a national products campaign, we always see these same old faces. I believe that most of the industrial and commercial sectors are still stuck in traditional ways. It must be understood that the national products movement requires the entire national commercial community to promote it together, and various groups of people must work together to advocate for it. For example, the vegetable oil lamp invented by Mr. Zhong Ling, as introduced by the editor of this publication, Yang Weng, is a kind of national product that most people hope to see. In short, no matter what kind of temporary market it is, the audience will never be limited to a certain group of people. Whether directly or indirectly, gentlemen of the national products and industrial and commercial groups should broaden their horizons and not be confined to one corner.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Wang Shuheng's New Contribution to the National Products Sector: Successful Experiment with Vegetable Casein <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Yimin</p>
<p>—A Promising New Industry Worth Introducing—</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Shuheng is the son of Mr. Wang Yongren of Baoshan. He graduated from the Department of Industrial Chemistry of Shanghai University this summer. Mr. Wang usually studies science with great care and has gained considerable experience. Recently, he has successfully extracted an industrial raw material from soybean cake and soybean residue that can replace imported dry casein! Mr. Wang showed samples of the soybean casein he produced and plywood made using the casein. The results were very good. According to Mr. Wang, this plywood is only used to prove that soybean casein can indeed replace imported dry casein. Casein has countless other applications in industry, such as: 1. Various adhesives, especially for coloring, inlaying, coating, and covering; 2. Artificial hard inlays such as bakelite and artificial horn; 3. Photographic film; 4. Cosmetics; 5. Soap; 6. Paper; 7. Artificial silk; 8. Artificial leather; 9. Wallpaper; 10. Paint; 11. Pharmaceuticals; 12. Food; 13. Insulators; 14. Leather shoe polish; 15. Emollients; 16. Mineral oil coagulants; 17. Waterproof cloth; 18. Insect repellent; 19. Dyeing industry; 20. Refining alcoholic beverages. In the past 30 years, the casein industry has made rapid progress in Europe and the United States, and its position in the manufacturing industry has become increasingly important. Countries with insufficient milk production must import casein from abroad. For example, Germany imports a large amount of casein from the United States and France every year, with an annual consumption of about 15,000,000 pounds. In 1918, the United States only produced 8,000,000 pounds, but in 1927, it increased to 18,000,000 pounds. After 1928, it imported as much as 28,000,000 pounds annually. In Argentina alone, casein exports were 1,930 tons in 1932, increasing to 4,424 tons in 1933. Other countries such as New Zealand and Belgium have also been increasing year by year. Mr. Wang, noting the astonishing consumption of casein and feeling that the amount of casein in milk is so small, believed that it was necessary to find new sources of supply. He considered that casein is a kind of protein, and China's world-famous main product—soybeans—would be an ideal item to supply this raw material. He immediately started extracting it and was indeed able to extract it. However, Mr. Wang felt that although using soybeans as raw material was cheaper than using milk, the cost was still too high, and the soybean oil had to be purified first, which was troublesome. It would be better to find a way to extract it from soybean cake and soybean residue, which would reduce costs and simplify the process. He continued his research and, after many precise experiments, finally succeeded. From now on, China can no longer rely on foreign goods to block a huge loophole. Vegetable casein is indeed one of China's promising new industries. The reporter felt that to revitalize industry, we must start from China's inherent special products, so that we can achieve twice the result with half the effort. Considering the important position of soybeans in China today, this industry must be developed. What pleases the reporter most is that the raw materials are China's special products, needless to say, and the applied medicines are all Chinese-made products. From beginning to end, no foreign goods are used at all, which is rare in the national products industry. If Chinese industrialists with lofty ideals can rise up and cooperate with Mr. Wang, then in a few years, why worry about not being able to compete with foreign goods and surpass them?</p>
<h3 id="e196">For the Sake of National Products <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>The cry to promote national products is deafening, but some people may be shouting slogans in words, but in reality, if you carefully examine everything they wear, eat, and use, most of them are probably imported goods. Why would they be so inconsistent in words and deeds, saying one thing and meaning another? Are they trying to be fashionable? No—I can infer the general psychology of people from my conversations with neighbors. A neighbor said: "There are indeed many kinds of national products now, but some items are of too poor quality! And they are not durable! Some are even more expensive than foreign goods! That makes people dislike them! We have no choice but to buy foreign goods." It turns out that some people buy foreign goods because national products are of poor quality, expensive, and not durable. Yes, there are indeed some national products with these characteristics, which cannot be denied.</p>
<p>However, you should know that resources are scarce! It takes a lot of time, money, procedures, and effort to make an item. Look at the materially civilized Europe and America. To research and manufacture a machine, someone may devote their entire life to it and still not be able to create it. Then their son continues the research. If the son cannot create it in his lifetime, he will pass it on to his grandson, who will continue to study diligently! They must make their work complete. This is not the author's fabrication. Anyone who understands the world situation probably knows this. From this, we can see that the creation of anything cannot reach perfection in a short time! Please do not criticize the newly created national products too harshly! Don't dislike them for being crude and not durable. As for the high price, it is also because at the beginning of creation, high-priced raw materials are used to seek the excellence of the product, so the selling price has to be raised a little. In short, in modern China, where industry and commerce are depressed and the economy is extremely panic-stricken, there is no other way to save the crisis than for all the people to use national products! As for the inferiority of domestic products, we can only "look at the sake of national products" and be happy to buy them.</p>

<h3 id="e198">Wishing the Chinese People to Pay Attention to Chinese Vegetable Oil Lamps <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Zunyuan</p>
<p>Mr. Yang An of this publication praised the two major recent inventions, one is the charcoal car of Mr. Xiang Citao and Tang Zhongming, and the other is the Chinese vegetable oil lamp of Mr. Zhong Ling. Indeed, these are really things worth praising in the national products industry. But many people already know about charcoal cars, and many people have tried them. Praisers are everywhere in the country, so I don't need to say more. Only the vegetable oil lamp has only recently been invented, and few Chinese people know about it. Mr. Yang An only praised its major advantages. Now, I will tell the Chinese people about the vegetable oil lamp in detail. This is driven by my conscience of loving national products, and I do not intend to do false propaganda for Mr. Zhong.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, the current economic crisis in our country has reached an irreparable point. Therefore, in recent years, people have often chanted to stop the leaks and revitalize the countryside. The government is also working hard on these efforts. In fact, to save the economic crisis, we must reduce deficits and relieve the countryside. According to the investigation, our country's annual deficit is 500 million yuan, and kerosene alone accounts for 100 million yuan, almost one-fifth of the total. Such a huge leak is indeed lamentable. However, the consumption of kerosene is entirely used for lighting lamps. The kerosene that the people in the inland of our country need every day is supplied by foreign countries every day. Once an international war breaks out, foreign merchants will monopolize and hoard goods, which is inevitable. If the source is cut off due to the war, then the lights of thousands of families will be extinguished. This is another shocking thing! Mr. Zhong has a broad vision, so he engaged in research. After four years of hard work, he invented the Chinese vegetable oil lamp. Using natural or artificial pressure to constantly press the oil to the lamp head, the lamp can be lit. The vegetable oil for lighting includes many kinds, such as soybean oil, rapeseed oil, peanut oil, cottonseed oil, biological oil, and all kinds of grass seed oil, which can be used to replace kerosene. Because these kinds of oil are entirely the richest products of China, taking profits locally, and not having to supply from foreign countries, in this way, we can reduce the outflow of rights and interests by about 100 million yuan every year. At the same time, the countryside increases production by 100 million yuan, which can reduce the number of unemployed people by several million. This is of course worth promoting. As for the style of the lamp, there are also many kinds, table lamps, hanging lamps, storm lamps (that is, mast lamps), large and small, simple and gorgeous, and they have also obtained the government's patent. Mr. Ding Tingbiao and other founders of the company have now raised a lot of capital and are preparing to set up a factory. They can ship goods on Double Ten Day. The day before yesterday, I was invited to visit the company's preparatory office to see various styles of lamps. Only then did I believe that what they said about (1) low price (2) safety (3) hygiene (4) oil saving (5) brightness was true. Only then did I admire their keen vision. After returning home, I thought about it and couldn't forget it. I hope that the Chinese people will pay attention to it, and I hope that the leaders who implement the revitalization of the countryside will pay special attention.</p>

<p>— Ye Yiyi</p>
<p>Every intellectual has the responsibility and determination to promote and use national products.</p>
<p>Chinese women should use Chinese cosmetics, because Chinese cosmetics are not non-existent, nor are they bad. Like the famous Mei Lanfang, even though he has traveled all over Europe and Asia, he still uses Chinese cosmetics.</p>
<p>Domestic manufacturers should make comparison tables and identification tables of their respective products with imported products, print them into booklets, and distribute them to customers for publicity. I think that doing this would definitely be a very interesting advertisement.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the seventh day of the National Games. The men's and women's swimming competitions, which attracted the most attention, opened yesterday at the swimming pool. The audience was extremely large. Liang Yongxian and Yang Xiuqiong each set new women's records. In the all-around athletics, the Shanghai team was greatly reduced in strength, and the Liaoning team has hope of winning the championship. All ball games have reached the quarterfinals. Yesterday, the semifinals and quarterfinals of men's and women's tennis singles and doubles, and the semifinals of men's basketball, were particularly sensational. Today, all ball games are in the quarterfinals. The women's softball championship game will be held between Hebei and Shandong at 2 pm.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Women's 100-Meter Backstroke Heats: Liang Yongxian Sets New National Record, Excellent Time of 1 Minute 40.7 Seconds, Possible to Defeat Yang Xiuqiong Today, Yang Xiuqiong Breaks Far Eastern Games Record in 50 Meters <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>The men's and women's swimming competitions, which are the focus of public attention, started at 1 pm yesterday. Spectators scrambled to get in, and tickets were sold out long ago. The press seats were occupied by non-journalists, and there was no place to stand. The intense interest in swimming is also a good phenomenon. Yesterday, all were heats and quarterfinals. Among the men, Chen Zhenxing's 10.8 seconds in the short-distance 50 meters defeated Guangdong's Chen Qisong, averaging the best national record. Frog King Guo Zhenheng represented Guangdong, but did not show his power, probably because it was a heat. In the women's group, Yang Xiuqiong broke her own record set at the Far Eastern Games in both the heat and the quarterfinals, most notably, in the 100-meter backstroke heat, Miss Liang Yongxian of Guangdong broke Yang Xiuqiong's national record with a time of 1 minute 40.7 seconds, reducing the 1 minute 43 seconds made by Xiuqiong yesterday by a huge 2.5 seconds, and there is a real possibility of defeating Xiuqiong. I hope Miss Liang will do well today and give the people a new experience.</p>
<p>Chen Zhenxing's Best in Six Groups</p>
<p>The men's 50-meter freestyle quarterfinals were divided into six groups, with the top three in each group advancing. The audience's eyes were focused on Chen Qisong of Guangdong, Chen Zhenxing of Hong Kong, Liang Weisheng of Shanghai, and Yang Jimo of Malaysia. Qisong and Weimo were in the first group, thinking that the competition would be fierce and that good results would appear, but Yang Weimo retreated before the battle, Chen Qisong's strong enemy had gone, and he safely led. Min Hong Anxun relied on his final efforts to overwhelm Zeng Afu of Hong Kong. In the second group, Su Fangneng of Guangxi started well, but unfortunately, he repeatedly changed his breath midway, which greatly reduced his speed, and barely managed to get third place. Liang Weisheng reached the finish line first in the second group with 29.5 seconds. Liang Xianming of Guangxi was eliminated by a hair's breadth. There were no outstanding people in the fourth group. Zheng Huaiwang of the Philippines actually got the first place in 30 seconds. Zhou Zhaohua, a young general from Zhejiang, was indeed good, and was not far from Zheng, ranking third. In the fifth group, Chen Zhenxing stood out from the crowd. He was the last to enter the water, but he took the lead midway. Although Huang Rixiong tried his best to catch up, he only overwhelmed Huang Jinghuan of Guangxi to rank second, with a time of 28.9 seconds, which was the best in each group. In the sixth group, Li Luomin's sprint was very good. Qing Lu Shou xiao lost to Liang Hao of Guangdong and failed to be selected, which is a pity.</p>
<p>Yang Xiuqiong Breaks Far Eastern Games Record</p>
<p>The women's 50-meter heats were held in four groups, with the top four in each group advancing. In addition to Liang Rihong of Malaysia, Li Xiachao and Wei Shaosheng of Guangxi, Liu Suxian of Shanghai, Shi Huizhi and Yang Mary of Fujian, and six others occupying a seat, the rest were all from Hong Kong and Guangdong. Yang Xiuqiong started last in the fourth group, but she took the lead before long, and reached the finish line, throwing off Liang Yuzhen of Guangdong by more than five meters, with a time of 36 seconds, breaking her own Far Eastern Games record of 36.92 seconds, and her own national record of 38.2 seconds. Liu Suxian of Shanghai overwhelmed Yang Xiuzhen in the third group, and also broke Yang's national record with a time of 37.6 seconds. In addition, Chen Yuhui lost to Huanqiong by half a foot, with a good result. Only six people started in the second and third groups, so three were selected. The Wu Wenjin and Wenjing sisters happened to be ranked fourth in the two groups, and unfortunately failed to be selected, which is a pity.</p>
<p>Frog King Xiao Guo Takes the Lead</p>
<p>The 200-meter breaststroke heats were divided into six groups, with the top three in each group advancing. In the first group, Chen Fuxing of Hong Kong took the lead as soon as he started. He Shidong of Malaysia surpassed him by two feet at 100 meters. Fuxing tried hard to catch up, but Shidong took the lead. In the second group, Huang Eryi of the Philippines overwhelmed Liu Zenghou and Fang Zongyu with a time of 3 minutes 14.4 seconds, which is very difficult. It is a pity that Lao Jicheng, the general of Malaysia, did not come, which reduced the color a lot. In the third group, Frog King Xiao Guo Yuanxing of Shanghai and Jian Erjie were in the same third group. Jian recovered from his sore and Ye Quan, Guo's big enemy, had gone, so he was aloof and leisurely, leading the way all the way, winning the second place by more than 20 meters at the finish line, and reaching as many as 35 meters from the third place. However, because of the lack of competition, the results were not satisfactory. In addition, Wang Yaomin of Guangdong in the fifth group had quite old skills, and Liu Meixiu in the fourth group had a beautiful sprint, each taking the first place. Jian Erlian of Shanghai dived more than 30 meters after entering the water, which won a lot of applause. He and Zhong Shoujun in another group failed to be selected by a slight margin, which is a pity.</p>
<p>Liang and Yang Break National Records in Backstroke</p>
<p>Among the various swimming styles, backstroke is the most difficult, so there are very few participants in the women's 100-meter backstroke, and it is only held in two groups, with the top four in each group advancing. Liang Yongxian of Guangdong stood out after entering the water, breaking the national record of 1 minute 45.2 seconds held by Yang Xiuqiong with 1 minute 40.7 seconds. Pang Yongfang of Guangxi is also not weak, and worked hard to catch up, with only four feet left at the finish line, which can be said to be difficult. Xiuzhen has recently practiced backstroke and has quite a bit of skill. She ranked third yesterday. After all, the mermaid Yang Xiuqiong in the second group is extraordinary. The others are far from her opponents. She took the lead 20 meters after entering the water. Sure enough, she led the way all the way, and the distance from Li Hezheng, the last Beijing athlete, at the finish line was more than 30 meters, with a time of 1 minute 43 seconds, breaking her own national record, but it was still about three seconds slower than Liang Yongxian. There should be a fierce battle in the finals.</p>
<p>Chen Zhenxing Ties National Record</p>
<p>In the men's 50-meter freestyle quarterfinals, Chen Zhenxing did indeed overwhelm Chen Qisong and won the first place, with a time that tied the national record. Pan William of Fujian sprinted at the end and took third place before Liang Weisheng of Shanghai. Zheng Huaiwang of the Philippines in the first group is indeed skilled. Although he is no match for Li Luomin of Hong Kong and Chen Hongcheng of Malaysia, he has overwhelmed Wang Xiushan of Guangdong. Li Luomin started well yesterday, and his sprint was also good. If Liang Weisheng of Shanghai can exert his best skills in this final, he may have hope of winning the runner-up.</p>
<p>Mermaid Recreates Far Eastern New in Quarterfinals</p>
<p>The results of the two groups of the women's 50-meter freestyle quarterfinals have all become the world of Hong Kong and Guangdong. Malaysia, Shanghai, Fujian, and Guangxi have all been eliminated. The most regrettable thing is that Liu Suqian of Shanghai created a new national record with 37.6 seconds in the heats, but she was eliminated by Sa Huiying in the quarterfinals. Sa's score in the heats was above 42 seconds, and she made rapid progress in the quarterfinals. Yang Xiuqiong did not disappoint the public and broke the Far Eastern and national records again with 36 seconds in the first group's quarterfinals, which is truly difficult. Liu Guizhen of Guangdong won the first place in the second group, and Chen Yuhui struggled to get the fourth place.</p>
<p>Frog King Triumphs in Breaststroke Quarterfinals</p>
<p>In the men's 200-meter breaststroke quarterfinals, Frog King Xiao Guo slashed and led the way all the way. Liu Kun and Wang Yaomin struggled hard and overwhelmed He Shidong of Malaysia to rank second and third. Liu Meixiu in the second group is indeed skilled and sits securely in the first place, but Chen Fuxing still failed to Huang Liuyi of the Philippines. Huang did not start well, but his speed was very fast in the middle. If he can work hard at the starting point, he is also a good material. Liu Kun of the Guangxi army chased Frog King hard in the first group, and his posture was beautiful. Although he lost, he was still glorious.</p>
<p>Li Luomin Overwhelms Chen Qisong</p>
<p>The last program, the men's 100-meter freestyle, is one of the most interesting items. It is divided into six groups, with the top three in each group advancing. Wu Wenjian of Malaysia overwhelmed Zeng Afu and took the first place in the first group. Liang Xianming, the standard bearer of the army, has strong strength. Wang Xiushan of Guangdong tried hard but failed. Liang safely got the first place in the second group. After the third group, Liang Weisheng, 1 minute 10.8 seconds, has not yet exerted his full strength. In the fourth group, Wu Niansheng of Guangdong beat Huang Jinghuan of the Guangxi army by about half a foot. In the fifth group, Chen Zhenxing still led the way. Pan William of Fujian was only two feet behind at the finish line. Chen's score was 1 minute 7.8 seconds. In the sixth group, Li Luomin was skilled, and at the finish line, he overwhelmed Pan William of Fujian, who maintained the national best, by one body length. Pan William of Fujian is indeed strong. If he can work hard, he has great hope in the finals.</p>

<p>Wang Jihuai Ranks Third</p>
<p>The pentathlon was less exciting yesterday, because Hao Xinde was not qualified to participate, Chen Saiqiu also withdrew voluntarily, and Wang Jihuai's performance declined, so the competition situation was unusually relaxed. A total of 15 people participated in the competition. Peng Yongxin, Bi Qinghua, Dong Hanwen, and Tian Jingyao withdrew midway. A total of 11 people persisted to the end. As a result, Ji Maode of Shanxi won the championship with 2603 points. Ji was the first in North China last year. Huang Yingjie of Guangdong struggled hard and jumped to second place. Huang worked especially hard in the competition yesterday, and fainted at the very last 1500-meter finish. Ji Maode's victory was due to the last 1500 meters, in which he scored more than 800 points, and the scores of other events were also very average and considerable. According to the new scoring method used this time, it is equivalent to more than 2,900 points in the old scoring method. The complete results are recorded below.</p>
<p>(1) Ji Maode (Shanxi) 2603 points</p>
<p>(2) Huang Yingjie (Guangdong) 2594 points</p>
<p>(3) Wang Jihuai (Shanghai) 2507 points</p>

<p>Liaoning Team Leads from Start to Finish, Shanghai Team Unable to Catch Up</p>
<p>Yesterday's 1600-meter relay race, due to only nine participating units, the preliminary round was changed to a final. The participants included Malaya, Beiping, Shanghai, Hubei, Hunan, Nanjing, Guangdong, Liaoning, and Qingdao, nine teams in total. Among them, the strongest were the Shanghai and Liaoning teams. The Shanghai team had Yao Daining in the first leg, Li Peide in the second leg, Dong Shuzhao in the third leg, and Dai Shuyin in the fourth leg. The Liaoning team had Jin Changxian in the first leg, Wu Jingyao in the second leg, Li Shiming in the third leg, and Liu Changchun in the fourth leg. At the start, Yu Zhenjiang immediately took the lead, followed by Liang Yunming of Guangdong in first place, and Yao Daining of Shanghai in third place. It was not easy to catch up in the second leg. In the third leg, Shanghai had Dong Shuzhao and Liaoning had Li Shiming. Li led by ten meters, and Dong struggled to catch up from behind, overtaking Guangdong first, but ultimately unable to catch up with Liaoning. In the fourth leg, Liu Changchun made a very fast start, while Dai Shuguo struggled to chase from behind. At the 1500-meter mark, Dai was exhausted and her speed decreased, while Liu strode forward, sprinting straight to the finish line, with a time of three minutes and forty seconds. Unfortunately, they failed to break the national record. The complete results are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Liaoning Team: Jin Changxian, Wu Jingyao, Li Shiming, Liu Changchun</p>
<p>(2) Shanghai Team: Yao Daining, Li Peide, Dong Shuzhao, Dai Shuguo</p>

<p>The 400-meter relay preliminary of the all-around competition was held at 10:30 AM on the 16th. Only nine teams participated: Qingdao, Beijing, Guangdong, Malaya, Hebei, Suiyuan, Liaoping, and Shanghai. They were divided into two groups, with the top four from each group advancing. Malaya, in the second group, competed fiercely with Shanghai, but was disqualified because the third runner stepped out of the lane. The eight qualified teams are scheduled to compete in the final on the afternoon of the 17th. The rankings and results of the two groups are as follows:</p>
<p>First Group</p>
<p>First Place: Guangdong Team</p>

<p>The first half of the decathlon was completed yesterday, with Zhang Lingjia leading with 2901 points. A total of fifteen athletes completed the first half of the competition yesterday. It is expected that the rankings may still fluctuate today, so the official scores will not be determined until the second half is completed. Yesterday, in addition to Zhang's 2901 points, Zhou Changxing of Liaoning and Ye Songping of Shanghai each scored 2800 points. Zhou was the decathlon champion of last year's North China Games and has better results in the second half. Although he is currently tied for second place with Ye, it is possible that he will surpass Zhang Lingjia today. Therefore, the championship and runner-up positions will be contested by Zhou and Zhang. Wang Shilin of Beiping, Wu Jingqi of Fujian, Xia Shufu of Liaoning, and Liang Zhichu of Guangdong also have hopes of finishing in the top six.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Overall Situation of the All-Around Championship: Liaoning and Shanghai are Evenly Matched <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>The all-around competition will conclude today, with the remaining events being the second half of the decathlon and the 400-meter relay. According to yesterday's situation, Liaoning Province has already obtained twelve points, while Shanghai and Guangdong have each obtained nine points. In today's decathlon, Zhou Changxing of Liaoning can secure at least the runner-up position, and Xia Shufu can also be selected for the fifth or sixth place. Liaoning can score six to seven points in the decathlon, while Shanghai can only have one athlete selected, scoring at most two to three points. In the 400-meter relay, Shanghai is guaranteed to win the championship and score seven points, while Liaoning can only be selected for sixth place and score one point. Based on the cumulative scores of the two days, Liaoning can obtain 19 points, and Shanghai can also obtain 19 points. The two sides are evenly matched, and it remains to be seen who will emerge victorious.</p>

<p>Photos Prove that Beiping Also Ran Out of Their Lane: Why Isn't Their Qualification Canceled Under Similar Circumstances? The Inspectors Didn't Discover the Error at the Time.</p>
<p>In the women's 400-meter relay final, the Shanghai team ran out of their lane. Guangdong team protested, and Wang Kai's photograph proved this. The chairman of the judging committee, Zhang Boling, considered the evidence conclusive and ruled that the Shanghai team's qualification should be canceled. The details have been reported in yesterday's newspaper. The organizing committee officially announced the decision yesterday. However, after receiving the organizing committee's notice and the evidence from Wang Kai's photograph, the Shanghai team discovered that the Beiping team also ran out of their lane. The Beiping team's starting point was the fifth lane, but according to the photograph taken by Wang Kai, it was in the fourth lane. Therefore, the Beiping team should also be disqualified. Furthermore, after the 400-meter relay final was completed, the error was not discovered on the field, and the chief judge also signed the announcement, making the final decision. Therefore, it is questionable whether after-the-fact photographs can be used as evidence to protest and cancel qualifications. Shao Rugan, the head of the Shanghai delegation, has verbally protested to Zhang Boling, the chairman of the judging committee, and it will be discussed when the judging committee meets today. As for the Guangdong side, having already won the case, the organizing committee will return the 50-yuan guarantee in full today.</p>
<p>Organizing Committee Responds to Hubei Team Leader</p>
<p>A previous letter from Liu Changhe, the head of the Hubei delegation, protesting the eligibility of Wang, Hao, and Xu, was also officially replied to by the organizing committee yesterday. It stated that Tu Jihuai had investigated and found no problems, and that Hao Chunde and Xu Hengye had been disqualified from this year's competition by the organizing committee. The issue of athlete eligibility is now officially concluded.</p>
<p>Organizing Committee Responds to Sichuan Team Leader</p>
<p>Liu Shenzhan, the head of the Sichuan delegation, previously protested the error in the martial arts record. The organizing committee officially replied to the Sichuan delegation yesterday, stating that regarding the soccer issue, your team has already withdrawn the protest. As for the martial arts and archery, it has been verified that the score is 100.8, not 108.</p>
<p>Letter from the Sichuan Team Leader to This Newspaper</p>
<p>Liu Shenzhan, the head of the Sichuan delegation, wrote to this newspaper, saying: "Dear Editor, regarding the two points of our team's protest against the soccer match, they are entirely based on facts. Yesterday (the 15th), your newspaper published the referee's response: (1) '...judging by the facts, the referee would not randomly blow the whistle without reason.' Our team also feels that 'judging by the facts, the Sichuan team would not protest without reason.' (2) '...but there was no rest period in between. Sichuan players went off the field for a short break at the 15-minute mark. Therefore, the Sichuan team's timing was probably mistaken by deducting this rest time.' This is not the case. Going off the field for a break was not limited to the Sichuan team, and it was not for three minutes. We hope your newspaper can publish a correction. As for our team's attitude, it has been extremely open. When our team verbally protested to the referee, he politely replied without saying, 'I don't understand, you can report it directly to the organizing committee,' which would have been impolite. Otherwise, this protest would not have been filed. Since it has been submitted for discussion, our team has consistently stated that we have no desire for victory or to cause trouble. Our intention is to inform the organizing committee and ask them to pay attention. We appreciate the commendation from both Dr. Zhang and Dr. Wang, and there will be no further dispute. We hope you will understand our sincere intentions. Sincerely, Liu Shenzhan, Head of the Sichuan Delegation, October 16th."</p>

In an extremely dangerous situation where defeat seemed inevitable, they managed to overcome the difficulties and eliminate Lin Wangsu and Chen Qinan of Malaya, respectively, thus earning the right to participate in today's quarterfinals. This can be considered fortunate. In the other two groups, Xu Cheng of Java defeated Wang Wenzheng in straight sets, quite easily. Wang initially resisted strongly, but after losing two sets in a row, he lost his will to fight and his morale completely collapsed. The match between Qian Yaobin and Zeng Duancai was similar to the Shanghai-Malaya match, lasting for five long sets. Qian ultimately won through his spirit of resisting to the end.</p>
<p>Lin and Xu to Compete in the Quarterfinals Today</p>
<p>The final four remaining players in the singles competition are Xu Chengji and Lin Baohua for the first singles, and Qiu Feihai and Qian Yaobin for the second singles. The quarterfinals will begin at 1 PM today. The winners of the two groups will compete for the championship later. Xu Chengji's voice is naturally the highest. According to the regulations set by this year's tournament, in addition to the champion, the second, third, and fourth places must also be determined separately. Assuming that Qiu Feihai defeats Qian Yaobin, and Lin Baohua loses to Xu Chengji, then Lin and Qiu will still have to fight a brotherly battle within the same unit to determine second and third place.</p>
<p>Reiterating the Special Regulations</p>
<p>The championship system for this year's tennis tournament is different from the past. To promote competitive interest, special competition rules similar to open competitions are adopted, and team rankings are also taken into account. However, the method is well-intentioned but has led to many problems because various units do not fully understand it. This newspaper has repeatedly discussed this, but the authorities have not sought remedies. Only now, with the tournament underway, do the players understand this special competition method due to the stakes involved. The winners are naturally overjoyed, while the losers are full of complaints. Now that the semifinals are over, Lin Wangsu, Chen Qinan, and Wang Wenzheng of Malaya have all been eliminated, and their hopes for fourth place are dashed. On the other hand, since Qian Yaobin has entered the quarterfinals, he is guaranteed fourth place. Isn't this a joke? If the order of play had not separated the first and second singles players (by first selecting the best eight players in the ideal order, and then mixing the remaining first and second singles players), the current problems would not have arisen.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Malaya Doubles Rescheduled</p>
<p>Furthermore, the arrangement of the competition schedule is also inadequate. A five-set match cannot be held in the afternoon of the same day. There is not enough time, and the players' energy is depleted. For example, in yesterday's match between Malaya and Shanghai, after a grueling five-set singles match, they had to continue playing doubles. Moreover, the players for both singles and doubles were the same people. After the singles match, everyone was exhausted and barely able to walk. How could they play doubles again? And since it was getting late, it had to be rescheduled. The Java-Sichuan doubles match was started earlier, but was still stopped halfway and not finished. With the score at two sets to one, Sichuan was ahead, and the match was postponed to 9 AM today. The Shanghai-Malaya match was rescheduled to 9 AM tomorrow. The course of yesterday's singles matches is detailed below.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Lin Baohua <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>After a Storm, Seeing the Rainbow Again</p>
<p>The match between the two Lins was a hard-fought battle of five sets before the winner was decided. Lin Wangsu is a famous "gum ball," while Lin Baohua's patience has clearly improved significantly. Otherwise, he would surely have been defeated by Wangsu. The key to his victory was his ability to use slice shots effectively. Otherwise, he would not have been able to break Lin Wangsu's tough defensive style.</p>
<p>Saving the Day</p>
<p>In the first set, the two players traded shots back and forth. Wangsu was very steady, while Baohua made many unforced errors, losing three games in a row. In an instant, Lin Wangsu took a commanding lead of 5-1. Lin Baohua refused to give up and mustered his spirits, using slice shots that were sometimes deep, sometimes short, sometimes to the left, and sometimes to the right to lure Wangsu into running. The effect was immediate and successful. He won four games in a row, making the score 5-5. Wangsu was unable to cross the last hurdle to win the set. After 6-6, Baohua broke Wangsu's serve in the next game and then held his own serve, thus saving the day with a score of 8-6.</p>
<p>A State of Collapse</p>
<p>His control was weak, his shots were often unforced errors, and his morale was low. Wangsu was as steady as ever, using angled shots to trouble his opponent, rendering Baohua helpless. Wangsu easily won the set 6-1. In the next set, Baohua attacked with all his strength and took the first game, but then suddenly collapsed, getting worse and worse and losing his fighting spirit. Wangsu won again, easily, by 6-1.</p>
<p>Full of Difficulties</p>
<p>At this time, Lin Baohua's fatigue was evident, and everyone thought he would surely lose. The fourth set was not long in progress when Baohua was down 1-4. Qiu Feihai, who was playing on the adjacent court, was also in a critical situation, having lost two sets in a row. Zhang Zizhen, the coach of the Shanghai tennis team, who was watching the match, was saddened by the scene and slipped away, unable to bear to see the tragic defeat of the two players. After a long time, when he came back, Zhang saw that the situation had changed dramatically and suddenly clapped and stomped his feet, overjoyed. This was because Lin Baohua, at several points, had narrowly avoided losing the set when he was down 2-5, 3-5, and 4-5. He had managed to stop the dike from bursting and regained his position, tying the score at 7-5.</p>

<p>Seeing the Rainbow Again</p>
<p>Barely surviving, enduring hardship and finding happiness. In addition, thousands of spectators were clapping and cheering him on, boosting Baohua's spirits and making him excited. Although he was extremely tired, he didn't feel his fatigue. On the other hand, Lin Wangsu, who had failed to win several times when he could have, felt panicked and confused. The more careful he was, the less effective he was. In the fifth set, Wangsu was not as steady as Lin Baohua and repeatedly fell into his own trap. Baohua's backhand shots, either close to the net or deep into the corners, made it difficult for Wangsu to defend. When the score was 3-1, Qiu Feihai had already won and was resting. Baohua went forward to shake hands and congratulate him. Two tragic brothers, looking at each other and smiling bitterly. The onlookers were also moved.</p>
<p>Soon after, Lin Baohua went from 4-1 to 5-2 and finally won with a score of 6-3, seeing the rainbow again. Wangsu was defeated miserably. Qiu Feihai also ran forward to embrace Baohua, and they both looked at each other and smiled bitterly. The audience was also saddened by this.</p>

<h3 id="e214">Qiu Feihai <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Only by Enduring the Bitterest of Hardships Can One Become a Person Above Others</p>
<p>In the first two sets of Qiu Feihai vs. Chen Qinan, Qiu led with 4-1 each time, but ended up losing both sets with a score of 4-6. The situation was extremely critical. Unexpectedly, he then rose three levels in a row and turned defeat into victory. This was also a close call.</p>
<p>Gaining and Losing Again</p>
<p>Qiu and Chen had the same style of play, both attacking with soft shots. Each point was won and lost after a very long back-and-forth. Neither player had a strong killing instinct, and the scene was very humorous. Qiu Feihai was in good form, taking the lead with 4-1 first. Chen Qinan ran and returned the shots, not showing any weakness. They tied the score at 4-4, and Qiu was at a loss, losing the set 4-6. The situation was the same in the next set. Qiu took the lead again with 4-1, but ended up losing again with a score of 4-6. This was a great pity.</p>
<p>Rising Three Levels in a Row</p>
<p>Although Old Qiu is old, he has enough stamina. Although he had lost two sets, he was still confident of winning. Sure enough, Old Qiu had a plan in mind, remaining calm and composed, taking one step at a time, and gradually expanding his lead. He rose three levels in a row, and the sky cleared after the rain. He won the third set easily with a score of 6-2. The fourth set was a long and dramatic battle. Old Qiu managed to tie the score at 5-5, then won the next two games, 7-5, flying over the ocean and being safe and sound. In the last set, Chen Qinan was exhausted from running and made many unforced errors. Qiu won again with a score of 6-1. Only by enduring the bitterest of hardships can one become a person above others.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Xu Chengji <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Winning Three Cities in a Row is Extremely Easy</p>
<p>Xu Chengji, the famous general from Java, possesses extraordinary and unparalleled ball skills. He has been fighting continuously and smoothly, without losing a single set. This is truly commendable. Yesterday, he fought against Wang Wenzheng, the representative from Sichuan, and also won straight sets to secure a spot in the semi-finals. Wang Wenzheng was originally a skilled player in Shanghai, but compared to Xu, he was like a small sorcerer meeting a great one. Moreover, he is crude and impatient, completely lacking cultivation. The sportsmanship and morality that an athlete should possess are even more absent. When he wins, he is arrogant and disdainful of everyone; when he loses, his face is full of anger, blaming heaven and others, abandoning himself, and being perfunctory. Therefore, it is fitting that he failed.</p>
<p>Perfect Performance</p>
<p>The situation in yesterday's battle was tense at the beginning, with a perfect performance. After losing two sets in a row, Wang became disheartened and his form became scattered. After the first set, Wang managed to pull back one game, but Xu then took a commanding lead with a score of 4-2. In the next game, Wang made consecutive double faults while serving, losing the game. Xu used his sharp serve to win the first set with a score of 6-2.</p>

<p>Admitting Defeat</p>
<p>Amidst the cheers, Wang was especially careful, calmly responding to the battle. Xu showed a slight carelessness, repeatedly committing suicide under the net. As a result, Wang won two games first. Xu returned the favor, creating a 2-2 tie. Wang desperately attacked, using both draws and pressure, taking the lead again at 4-2. Unexpectedly, the good times did not last long. Chengji displayed his skills, drawing backhands and forehands, going straight from the sidelines, with unpredictable movements both near and far. Wang was exhausted from running around, and had to admit defeat. Xu reversed the situation from defeat to victory with a score of 6-4. In the third set, Xu's brilliance was further revealed, with immense arrogance, breathing loudly. Against a tough opponent, they pulled and tugged, fought fiercely for five games before a winner was decided. After the match, they were all exhausted and complained endlessly.</p>
<p>Each Two Ties</p>
<p>At the beginning of the battle, [Xu] had gone on a roll and taken the lead with a score of 5-1. [Wang] tried hard to catch up, adding two games, but ultimately lost the first game of the Shanghai-Malaysia singles semi-finals to Lin Wangsu, who was using a backhand (top), Qiu Feihai with a smash (middle), and Lin Baohua (bottom) (photographed by Ye Changlie) with a score of 3-6. After losing four games in a row, Wang saw that the situation was gone, and became disheartened and without fighting spirit, so the situation became lax. Xu finished the third game with a score of 6-1.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Qian Yaobin <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Pulling and Tugging, Fighting Fiercely for Five Games</p>
<p>Zeng Ruicai from Java has mediocre ball skills, but he is known for his endurance. Qian Yaobin from Sichuan is only so-so, but he occasionally has sharp draws and pressure, changing the score. In the second game, Qian responded carefully and improved greatly, repeatedly taking the lead at 4-1 and 5-3. Zeng desperately counterattacked, creating a 5-5 tie. Afterwards, Qian took two more games in a row, with a score of 7-5, each winning one set. The third game lasted the longest, with each side winning a game, refusing to give way. Each point required several back-and-forths before a winner was decided, with 1-1, 2-2, and so on until 6-6. Little Qian took the lead, but at this time his arm strength was lacking and many uncontrolled shots were seen. As a result, Zeng added two games, ending with a score of 8-6. After resting and fighting again, Little Qian's courage doubled, his shots were powerful and as he wished, everything went smoothly, and he won four games in a row. Zeng saw that the situation was dangerous and rose up to chase hard. Sure enough, the momentum shifted, and they tied at 4-4. But after a fierce battle, he felt exhausted. Qian saw an opportunity and desperately drew and hit, frequently applying pressure, creating a 6-4 score and tying the sets at 2-2.</p>
<p>Continuing Efforts</p>
<p>The next set was a matter of life and death, and each side used all their strength to compete. But since Little Qian had won the previous set, his momentum was strong, and there were people cheering him on from the sidelines to encourage him, so the situation took a sharp turn for the worse, with scores of 3-1 and 4-2, taking a high lead. Zeng responded calmly, without showing any expression, and used the "sticky" method to trap the enemy. Qian then got angry and only drew and pressed, but unexpectedly, all his force became uncontrolled shots or self-destructed. Zeng waited patiently, carefully and cautiously, and gained the final victory at 7-5.</p>

<p>In the first set, Wang's serve was successful, and Xu Chengji returned the favor, creating a score of 1-1. Afterwards, Er Xu went to the net to intercept, winning three games in a row, taking the lead at 4-1. Shi Qian tried hard to chase, adding two games, and trailed at 3-4. Then Er Xu used high pressure to control the net, winning both victories, and ending with a score of 6-3. In the second set, Wang and Qian broke the boat and vowed revenge. Although Er Xu won the first game, they lost more than they gained, losing five games in a row. The Sichuan team took a high lead at 5-1. Er Xu carefully, and calmly fought, and the reputation of the famous general was indeed extraordinary, rising three levels in a row, trailing by only 4-5. In the meantime, the two sides engaged in short-handed combat and competition was extremely fierce, and the atmosphere was extremely tense for a while. However, the Sichuan team seized the opportunity and tried their best to attack, and finally won back a set with a score of 6-4. In the third set, Er Xu knew that a great enemy was in front of them and did not dare to underestimate them, so they carefully advanced with cannonball-style serves and high pressure as heavy as Mount Tai, and repeatedly made achievements. Wang and Qian also held the ambition to avenge their shame and were even more careful, following them closely, and especially with Little Qian's active efforts and excellent performance. The two sides sometimes engaged in short-handed combat, and sometimes exchanged long draws, and the wonderful moments were met with thunderous applause. At 5-4 and 6-5, Er Xu took the lead all the way. Little Qian served, creating a tie. Then Wang and Qian took the lead with a score of 7-6. In the next game, Wang served, Er Xu had one uncontrolled shot each, ending the game with Guangju, and Sichuan then took the lead with a score of 8-6. It was already late, and the game was postponed.</p>

<p>Philippine Team Lacking Experience Defeated by Nanjing Team Qing and Yue Teams Fail Ping and Ji Win Semi-Finals Spots</p>

In the first game, Nanjing vs. Philippines, Nanjing suddenly changed its style yesterday, abandoning its consistent aggressive play and using fast passes and long passes to defeat the enemy, resulting in the elimination of the Philippines with a score of 40 to 39. In the next game, Shanghai vs. Hubei, the Shanghai team swept away its listless state from the previous day and, after a bloody battle, eliminated the strong Hubei team.

<h3 id="e222">Nanjing Slightly Defeats the Philippines The Philippine Army Loses Due to Lack of Experience <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>49 to 39</p>
<p>The second game of the Nanjing vs. Philippines men's basketball match was held yesterday morning at 9:00 AM in the gymnasium. A quarter of an hour before the start of the game, the surrounding area was already full. After 40 minutes of fierce battle, Nanjing relied on its rich experience and rapid shooting to defeat the Philippine army with a score of 49 to 39. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Plum Blossom Formation Solid as a Fortress</p>
<p>The Nanjing team initially used Tang Baokun, Zhang Changqing, Li Zhenzhong, Wang Shixuan, and Zhao Zhihua as their five generals. The Philippine Islands Yang family generals also did not appear on the stage. Less than a minute after the start of the game, Li Zhenzhong raised his hands and the record was opened. Then he made another free throw. The Philippine Island Ma Wenjiu returned the favor with a shot. The army commanded by Little Tang formed a plum blossom formation, solid as a fortress. When they had the opportunity, they used lightning-fast means to penetrate the enemy's hinterland and return with a basket, and the score increased sharply, taking the lead by 23 to 10. The Philippine army saw that the situation was not good, and the Yang brothers came on the field one after another. Sure enough, the generals showed their skills, and they showed their colors as soon as they came on the field, chasing to 18 to 23 in one breath. At this time, Li Lizhong and Tang Baokun suddenly rose up to their former glory, using extremely beautiful passes, and shot and free throws, ending the first half with a score of 28 to 20.</p>
<p>Little Tang Leaves the Stage Giving Instructions</p>
<p>After changing sides and fighting again, General Tang Baokun suddenly heard that he was fined off the stage, and the whole audience was shocked. Li Zhongduo respectfully listened to the instructions and ordered the army to respond calmly. Zhang Changqing did not disgrace his mission and built two more achievements. Gao Changming replaced Zhao Zhihua and took the stage, and the rear defense became more consolidated. The main general of the Philippine army, Yang Shufang, was injured in the leg when he fought Hunan the previous day, and his strength was affected, but he still reluctantly fought, and once reached a situation of 28 to 30. However, the Nanjing Five Tigers used a desperate method to tightly guard Li Zhenzhong, and scored two more goals. Gao Changming made another long-range contribution and threw the Philippine team down again. At this time, Zhang Chenqing of the Beijing team and Su Wenxiu of the Philippine team committed four fouls at the same time, and the positions of both sides shook. The Philippine team could not overtake, and Nanjing could not get much more, and in a stalemate, the Nanjing fellow villagers were beaming and defeated the Philippines with a score of 49 to 39.</p>
<p>Lack of Experience</p>
<p>Looking at the two armies yesterday, their ball skills each have their own merits. The speed of the Philippine Islands army is unmatched in the country, but they were eliminated due to poor experience and lack of variation. Personal techniques, such as Yang Shufang, Shi Jiaqi, Ma Wenjiu and others, can be listed as first-class players. Nanjing relied on its rich experience and sophisticated play, using softness to overcome strength. Little Tang did not seem to be very strong yesterday, but his job of specializing in passes had a great relationship with every ball he got. Li Zhenzhong relied on his natural height and stole a lot of cheap shots when jumping the ball. The defender Gao Changming can attack and defend. If the Beijing team had put this person on the stage earlier, it might not have been so threatened. In short, the Philippine team's defeat was not due to a lack of skill, but due to a lack of experience in formal large-scale battles.</p>

<p>Forty-One to Thirty-Two Points</p>
<p>The Shanghai vs. Hubei game was held at 10:00 AM yesterday. As expected, the wet team would be eliminated. Who knew that the Shanghai team woke up like a sleeping lion yesterday, changing its listless state in the previous day's battle against Shanxi. Little Feng appeared in the enemy's formation, extremely agile. Sun Baoqing guarded the rear and made great contributions. The long-legged Lu Gong had more merits than faults, and the whole team had excellent coordination. The Hubei team was at a loss, relying only on Ge Ke, who relied on his tall and strong body to win a lot of territory. Although Liu Zhenyuan had several excellent performances, his merits could not make up for his faults. Yin Hongxiang was old, and the rear defense became empty. If the team had been able to calmly deal with the situation on the stage and continue to guard before the end of the game, it would not have suffered such a disastrous defeat as yesterday.</p>
<p>Flustered Free Throws Missed</p>
<p>Referee Song Junfu blew the whistle to start the game. The long-legged Lu Zhongen got support from the rear and scored two points with one hand. Feng Nianhua's mind was wandering, and he shot two points with an arrow, and the scoreboard hung high at six to zero. The Hubei army was shocked. At that time, Hubei team center Chen Zongqi and defender Sun Baofa committed continuous fouls. The Hubei team members were flustered and missed three free throws. The whole audience sighed in unison. Who knew that things would improve. Center Ge Ke turned around under the basket and scored two goals in a row, and Zhenyuan shot from a long distance, also hitting the target, and the score became eight to seven. The Shanghai team's Little Feng added four points, and Center Ge really scored, scoring four goals alone, returning to take the lead with twenty to seventeen in the first half.</p>
<p>Smooth Sailing Everything Comes True</p>
<p>At the beginning of the second half, after Wang Ruo scored one point with a free throw, Sun Baofa robbed halfway and scored two goals, chasing to twenty-four to twenty-three. Liu Zhenyuan made another special contribution, and the score became twenty-nine to twenty-three. The Shanghai team urgently called a time-out and continued to send Feng Nianhua on the stage. After a long battle, they returned to take the lead with thirty-three to nineteen. At this time, the atmosphere was extremely tense. The Shanghai team's rear defense became more and more strict, and the Hubei team's shots jumped out of the basket every time. The Shanghai team was smooth sailing, everything came true, and they overcame the strong Hubei team with a score of forty-one to thirty.</p>

<p>Sixty-One to Thirty-One</p>
<p>The battle between Beiping and Qingdao was held at 1:00 PM yesterday. Yesterday, the Qingdao team's movements were extremely slow. With the ball in hand, they were hesitant and sat back to let the enemy's defensive net form. Therefore, they had no choice but to throw it from a distance, and because they were flustered, it was difficult to hit the target, creating an opportunity for the opponent to get the ball and attack nearby. The Beiping team, on the other hand, used high-speed passes and throws under the basket. Its play was exactly the same as that of the Philippine Islands, but its experience and changes surpassed them. If the team wins the finals, Nanjing's championship may still be a bit tricky.</p>
<p>After the mountain line jumped the ball, Mou Zuoyun broke through the enemy's basket twice like a swallow piercing the curtain. Li He was tall and strong, and occupied all the official positions when jumping the ball. He threw the ball under the basket without any effort. Right forward Mou scored three free throws out of three, taking the lead with a score of ten to zero. Qingdao lost and failed to shoot from a distance, and the score became seventeen to two. After Zhang Yucai pulled back a few points, the score became twenty-four to six, and he finally won the first half with a score of twenty-five to seven. After the golden bell sounded again, Kong Yiyi scored three points in a row, and Zhang Wangfeng also scored one goal each, which had the momentum to turn back the crisis. At this time, the mainstay of the Ping team, Mou Zuoyun, was fined off the court after four fouls. The Qing army went straight to the attack, and it looked like they were getting closer and closer to 18-36, and the score difference was not far. The Ping team quickly transferred Li Heding to the position of guard, and Yu Jinglao and Liu Yunzhang became rampant again, and the Qing team fell behind again. In the end, Beiping won the semi-final rights with a score of sixty-one to thirty-one.</p>

<p>Sixty-Two to Twenty-Five</p>
<p>Hebei's victory over Guangdong, like Beiping's victory over Qingdao, occupied an absolute advantage with the two words "swift and accurate". Center Liu Cuan became tall and strong, and the Guangdong and Vietnam athletes were eclipsed in comparison. This was already a big loss. In the sound of the silver horn, the competition began. The Hebei team immediately launched an extremely fierce offensive as soon as they started, and the artillery fire was continuous, and the Cantonese basket was repeatedly trapped. Right forward Wang Hongbin was as swift as a monkey, taking the lead with ten to one and thirty-one. The Cantonese army counterattacked once, and Luo Ji'an scored several goals, but the building was about to collapse, and one tree could not support it alone. Therefore, it was defeated by seventeen to twenty-two in the first half. After the rest and re-fight, Cantonese general Dong Dingfen was fined and left the field, and the entire army became more and more chaotic. The Hebei forwards fired and robbed, and won a great victory with sixty-two to twenty-five.</p>

<p>Shanghai Says Malaya and Hong Kong to Replay Tomorrow; Troops Rest Today</p>
<p>In yesterday's two football replay matches, Hong Kong thrashed Beiping 8-1 at 9:00 AM. The Beiping team used all its strength to monitor the action of football king Li Huitang, completely adopting a strategy of minimizing losses. The fact that they were able to pull back Gong was indeed extremely glorious. At 4:00 PM, Malaya played Tianjin. The Tianjin lineup showed considerable strength and resisted as much as possible, but the forward line's passing was slow, and the inner defense also made many mistakes, ultimately falling into an irreversible situation, resulting in a 5-0 loss. Hebei was defeated again. Hong Kong and Malaya gained the right to replay. Today is a day of rest, and on the 18th, the four teams from Shanghai, Guangdong, Malaya, and Hong Kong will compete for the final right. The athletes' competition will surely be an extremely fierce one.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Hong Kong Eliminates Beiping <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>Football King Li Huitang Monitored</p>
<p>Manage to Score One to Avoid a Shutout</p>
<p>Yesterday Morning at 9:00 AM</p>
<p>The football match between Hong Kong and Beiping began. The disparity in strength was significant. Beiping adopted a completely defensive stance, with very few opportunities for counter-attacks. Three or four players followed football king Li Huitang, but Li seized the opportunity to shoot, often scoring, which was commendable. After the start of the match, the Hong Kong team launched a full-scale attack. Li Zhaorong opened the scoring first, followed by Li Huitang, who scored another goal. Seeing the fierce momentum, the Beiping team focused on defense, but Li Zhaorong scored again in the chaos, making it 3-0. Then, Beiping's right-wing Zhu Chengming dribbled deep, broke through Liang Rongzhao's defense, and from three yards away from the goal, desperately kicked the ball, which hit the post and went into the net. The goalkeeper was caught off guard and could only despair. After a long period of melee, Li Zhaorong seized another opportunity to score. At this time, because Li Huitang was monitored too closely by the Beiping team, he transferred the activity to center-back Huang Meishun. Jiang Shun did not disappoint and scored with a long shot. Finally, the football king also scored a goal. The first half ended with a score of 6-1, with Hong Kong victorious.</p>
<p>Change Sides and Fight Again</p>
<p>Beiping adjusted its entire army, stationed in front of the goal, and formed a long line to resist the invasion. The Hong Kong team attacked the city for twenty minutes without success. Therefore, Zheng Jiliang was changed to the forward position, and Li Shuoyou and He Jiaqi were successively sent onto the field to practice their shooting skills. As a result, the offensive slowed down slightly, and the Beiping army slightly moved out to retaliate. However, the steel gate was too strong, making it difficult to cross the threshold. Li Zhaorong and Zheng Jiliang then scored a goal each. The result of the second half was 2-0, with a total score of 8-1. Hong Kong won the replay.</p>

<p>Head and Foot Skills Extremely Wonderful; Hebei's Five Forwards Slightly Slow</p>
<p>The Battle Between Malaya and Hebei</p>
<p>Started yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. Hebei had veterans such as Sun Jing, Jiang Lu, and Chen Erde, and their strength was not weak. They still showed spirit when fighting, but unfortunately, the Hebei army's five forwards were slow in action, and the inner defense line was also relatively thin. Malaya's passing was fast, and their head and foot skills were extremely wonderful. They were extremely brave and had studied the art of attacking the goal. It was already difficult for Hebei to maintain a 0-5 record.</p>
<p>Once the Battle Began</p>
<p>After ten minutes of melee, Xie Qingfu received a wonderful pass from the back, moved forward and scored the first goal. The Hebei army was unwilling to give in. Sun Fulai joined the side defense and launched an attack, but was blocked by Chen Erde and Lin Xifu, and there was no development. Soon, Yao Shenghua succeeded Xie Jiangong and scored another goal. In the next twenty minutes, although the Hebei goalkeeper counterattacked dangerously, his luck was not good, and his feet were not very accurate, so he did not achieve the desired effect. Before long, Yao Shenghua and Cui Chonglai attacked again and captured another city. The first half ended with a score of 3-0, with the Malaya team taking the lead.</p>
<p>Continue to Fight</p>
<p>In the second half, the Hebei team took a full offensive, trying to recover the lost ground, but they failed to attack repeatedly. Liang Laifu took the opportunity to score another goal, opening the record for the second half. Jiang Lu realized that the situation was dire and difficult to recover, so he vowed to go to the frontier and spy on the enemy's formation, but Li's foot skills were not effective, and Huang Jinbo saved the ball. Sun Yongquan spurred his horse to full speed, but was also trapped by the enemy. Before long, Zhang Deming shot without fail and hit the Malayan army's vital point, but was blocked by Huang Bo. Yin Jinzhen received a wonderful pass from the front street and spurred his horse to full speed, rushing into battle, forming a one-on-one situation, but was intercepted by Liu Shifan. The Hebei team seemed to gain the upper hand, and the three forwards formed a "crutch horse" formation, attacking the Malayan defense. Cai Wenli and An Lin returned to rescue, and although Jiang Lu stepped forward to assist, it was not successful. Xie Qingfu, when the game was about to end, scored again because the midfielder sent a high ball from a distance, resulting in a 5-0 victory. The overall result was 5-0, with Malaya winning. The lineups are as follows:</p>

<p>Yesterday in the women's netball, there were only two replay matches in doubles. The two pairs of sister flowers from Shanxi and Shanghai, due to the disparity in skill, formed a one-sided situation. The Shanxi group won the two games easily. The situation between the Sichuan and Malaya groups was relatively even, so there was some competition. However, both sides had mediocre skills and were not worth mentioning. The Sichuan group won with stability. Compared with the Shanghai group, they may not be able to compete with them. Looking at the current situation, Shanxi is expected to win the championship, and the Shanghai team has hope for second place, with Sichuan and Malaya ranking third and fourth. Yesterday's results are as follows:</p>
<p>Wang Sisters</p>
<p>Good at playing, especially good at doubles. Chunqing is good at attacking, and Chuncang is good at defending. They have both attack and defense, complementing each other. The Wei family sisters are slightly inferior. Mai Gu is stable and commendable, and Zu Tong is good at the net. The cooperation between the two seems to lack connection, resulting in occasional mistakes and giving the opponent opportunities to attack. Chuncang met Mai Gu in the singles semi-replay and was eliminated after a fierce battle of three sets, which she was very unhappy about. Yesterday's doubles match was a head-on collision, and she was particularly resentful. Therefore, at the start of the game, the Jin army immediately launched an offensive, with artillery fire and bullets raining down. The Shanghai team was in turmoil, and everyone was on high alert. The two Wang sisters were ruthless and exerted great pressure, while the Wei sisters were having difficulty and were unable to fight back. At the end of the two games, a shutout was achieved.</p>
<p>The Battle Between Chuan and Ma</p>
<p>Started on time. The Malayan overseas Chinese were intimidating and won a game. The Sichuan ladies were unwilling to be weak and won two games in a row. The Malayan girls tried again and were ahead 3-2, 4-3. The Sichuan ladies tried their best to maneuver and tied the score. Then they announced their victory with 6-4. In the midst of renewed fighting, the Malayan girls were in low spirits and were always at a disadvantage. Although they intended to fight to the death, they were slightly weaker and were eventually eliminated with a score of 6.</p>

<p>In the men's volleyball competition, several teams have already been eliminated. The remaining six teams are Shanghai, Hebei, Hong Kong, Guangdong, Beiping, Malaya, and Fujian. Except for Shanghai and Hong Kong, which have already entered the replay week, the four teams from Guangdong, Beiping, Fujian, and Malaya competed yesterday. As a result, Guangdong defeated Ping 3-0, and Min also defeated Yue 3-0. The replay will begin this afternoon. The two games yesterday were as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e232">(1) Malaya Defeats Fujian <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>Familiar with the Road, Malaya Wins First</p>
<p>The Malayan men's volleyball team, riding on its remaining power, powerfully killed Fujian. Malaya had the courage of Zheng Xinmin, but the whole team lacked cooperative skills. Their victory seemed to be a fluke. In today's replay, they will face Guangdong. Unless they use one hundred and twenty minutes of strength, it will be difficult to win. The Malayan overseas Chinese, you must encourage each other! At the beginning of the first game, Fujian's Wu Bisheng served, but the Malayan net failed, losing a point first. In the next round, Liao Jiade served and chased straight, gaining two points and forming a balanced situation. From then on, you come and I go, with gains and losses on both sides. However, Malaya was familiar with the road, winning the first game with a score difference of 21-19.</p>
<p>The Cannon Shakes the Sky, Stray Bullets Fly Everywhere</p>
<p>In the second game, the Fujian team urgently tried to counterattack, and Malaya's defense was also strong. The middle row killed on both sides, and both sides used fire power. The front row's closing the door was very important. However, due to the density of the bullets, the sound of the cannon was loud, and the guests in the stands were always in danger of stray bullets. In the first half of the game, Malaya had an advantage with a score of 11-7. In the second half, Fujian's Wu Bisheng served, straight and fast, and the Malayan rear array panicked, and there was a moment of confusion, losing seven points. So, it became a tie again. Fortunately, Malaya's ball was spiritual. Recognizing that the Min army had reported Qiong Yao, they should also reciprocate with peaches and plums, and they repaid it with four points in a row. The referee then announced that the victory belonged to Malaya. The score of this game was 20 to 16.</p>
<p>Missing the Opportunity, Losing the Stronghold</p>
<p>The third game had no special color. Fujian's strength was limited. The struggle for the second game was already not easy. The army's morale was panicked, and there were many suicides. Moreover, blocking the net and killing the ball was only beneficial to a flat cut. If they killed it hard due to the situation, it would be easy for the enemy's front row to close the door and refuse guests. The Min side was not familiar with this, so there were many opportunities, all of which were defeated. The result of the fight was 21-15, and Malaya won the replay with a victory of 3-0.</p>
<p>Malaya Lineup: Situ Jie, Li Mu, Liao Jiade, Wen Yanwei, Huang Xiuren, Liang Juhe, Lin Tianci, Weng Liande, Zheng Xinmin</p>
<p>Fujian Lineup: Wu Bisheng, Chen Xueshen, Ma Shaosong, Zhen Qinglin, Li Baosheng, Liao Dengming, Li Gengyuan, Zheng Qiming, You Tingyun</p>

<p>Great Disparity in Strength, a Hungry Tiger Pounces on a Dog</p>
<p>Guangdong volleyball has always had a great reputation. In this year's championship situation, the only team that can compete with Shanghai is this Yangcheng athlete. Although the Beiping team is not considered weak, compared with Guangdong, it is far behind. In the first game, Guangdong took the lead. The old general Feng Cai was indeed a town training. When the ball landed, it hit the capital's defense. At one time, Pingfang fell into a four-way encirclement, and there was no way out. The result of the first game was 21-8. The disparity in strength can be seen.</p>
<p>Once Tenacious, but Still Not Prosperous</p>
<p>In the second game, Beiping seemed lively. The Guangdong players also underestimated the enemy due to their pride. The momentum of Pingbei suddenly increased. In the first half, they took the lead with 11-9. In the second half, Guangdong was still not prosperous. Where is the prestige of the past today? They quickly worked hard. Beiping believed that the general trend of this game was already theirs, and they did not dare to relax a step. So the scores were closely linked. They worked hard at long and short hits. The game was indeed colorful. Gu Yu was still killed by Guangdong at 21, and the score was 22-21.</p>
<p>Straight Three Games, Guangdong Will Triumph In the third game, Beiping was caught off guard. As soon as they entered the court, they had defense without offense. The recorder reported the score, and it was often Guangdong. Beiping only scored five points in the first half. In the second half, the situation was still not good. Although there were cheerleaders on the side, they were onlookers and had nothing to do with the gains and losses. At the end of the game, it was 21-10. Guangdong won the replay with a straight three.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Hebei and Jiangsu were eliminated one after another. The male volleyball team will enter the replay week at the same time with the Shanghai vs. Ping and Xiang vs. Yue matches.</p>

<p>A String of Beads Announce Good News</p>
<p>Beiping and Hebei are like Xiang Yu and Guangdong. People say that they are from the same root, so why should they fight each other so urgently? The game started at 1:00 PM, judged by Guo Ziping. Hebei's Zhuang Jinhui opened the scoring, but before long, Beiping counterattacked and gained the upper hand. A string of beads announced good news. The score was 1-6 in the first half, and the Ping army won the first game, and their momentum increased.</p>
<p>Jade Arms Strike High, Without the Slightest Mercy</p>
<p>Beiping has an average talent and responds easily. Since they have the advantage, they are attacking with all their might. But because they forget the front and take care of the back, they are snatched away by the 8 ratio from 8. Switching to fight again, the 冀 has advanced to 20 to 16. It can be turned into a crisis, but the Beiping's Xiao Xiao Fenji's front attack and guarding, a time of apricot moon round eyes, jade arms high support, without any feelings, even under six points, with twenty-two pairs of twenty wins the second game.</p>
<p>The Heart Is as Chaotic as Hemp, Drinking Hate for Eternity</p>
<p>In the third game, Ji Fang worked hard. An Shuqing and Han Yansun had already discussed a night raid on Yu Camp during the break. Therefore, as soon as the game started, a sudden wind and cloud arose. The flat square was on the verge of danger. At one time, the oriole was angry and the swallow was chanting, which was very similar to a natural disaster. At the change of the semi-game, Ji Fang had an advantage with a score of 11-5. When the area was changed, the Beiping lady He Shijin, under the great anger, swept thousands of troops and occupied a lot. With the situation of advancing and retreating, Beiping once again took the upper hand. Hebei's heart was as chaotic as a hemp, and he lost his foot in the end. The final victory still belonged to Beiping. The score was 21-15, and Beiping won the replay right.</p>

<h3 id="e236">(2) Hunan Defeats Jiangsu <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>The Suzhou Lady's Momentum Is Terrible</p>
<p>The women's volleyball team in Hunan went to Malaya, and felt that both sound and color were very good. Yesterday, they fought against Jiangsu, and the front row killers lost a lot, and the back row was not good at saving. Is it a deliberate playing of the pipa? It is a general question for the audience. The competition started at 3:00. The elite of the two places of Jiangsu, Wuxi and Suzhou, have not been trained for a long time. After taking the stage, Hunan opened the war first, and Jiangsu yielded, losing half a dozen. Many of Wuxi's fellow villagers also cheered, and Zhang Jiapei and Yuan Guorong finally earned their breath and chased several points. At the end of the half, the Hunan Xiang army was still leading the way. After changing the walls, Jiangsu sent out a flat ball with a long body and jade strength, with a rough arm and big foot, with the heroic spirit of a southern man and a northern phase. The ball was like a poor one, and the Xiang army's old folks kept exclaiming. In the middle row, Zhai Meiying, the famous volleyball player in Shanghai two years ago, is now slightly outdated, but she is still lively and cute, and her style has not diminished. Therefore, the front, middle, and back are united, and the match is average, making Long Jianping create eight points in a row. The Hunan sisters suddenly became heroic, and lost a game 13-21.</p>
<p>Work Hard to Attack, and See the Color Again</p>
<p>In the second game, Jiangsu attacked with great effort. The Hunan killer sword could not be used. The audience was puzzled. Although the score in the first half was very close, in the second half, the Jiangsu middle and back rows performed exclusively, and they saved a lot of dangerous balls on the ground. The Jiao Niang in the mud did not care about lipstick and rouge. The Hunan girls seemed to lack experience, and they were at a loss when they saw Jiangsu scoring points in a row. In fact, the Jiangsu team was able to defend when it attacked lightly, but it was not enough to attack in a bloody battle. The Xiang army did not see this, so even committed suicide when serving, and lost to Jiangsu again by 17-21.</p>
<p>See the Flaws, Take the Lead</p>
<p>In the third game, Hunan slightly changed its lineup, and the instructor also gave detailed instructions on Jiangsu's flaws. Chen Jiajie and Liu Xingheng took the lead and charged forward. Jiang Jiapei in Jiangsu had long hands and weak hands. Hunan's three axes were not ordinary after all. For a time, there was no way to resist, and the battle line was in chaos. Qu Meiying was flying all over the court, but a single tree could not make a forest. Therefore, they were first defeated by the Xiang army by 12-21. In the fourth game, Hunan saw that Jiangsu ate hard but not soft, and seemed to have found a loophole. They took the right medicine, and of course they hit the mark. Jiangsu lost again and again, and the bystanders were worried first. Even if they filled the gas cylinder, they were still at a loss. Therefore, from 11-9 to 21-17, Jiangsu and Hunan became equal with 2-2.</p>
<p>Win Three Out of Five, Eliminate Jiangsu</p>
<p>The key to winning or losing in five games is that everyone has to be careful and cautious. The Suzhou lady originally intended to pull out the backup star Feng Yuzhen to the stage, but after Feng's failure in the field competition, she was unhappy, and her fragrant body was unwell and had not recovered. Therefore, she still responded with the original team. However, with the already accustomed teacher, how can they withstand this long-term battle? Therefore, it is difficult to maintain a balanced situation. In the first half, they were living uncomfortably with a score of 10-11. In the next battle, there was no way to prevent and rescue, and they were finally eliminated. The score was 18-21, and Hunan won the women's volleyball replay game with 3-2.</p>

<h3 id="e237">Men's Wrestling Final: Beiping Team Protests; National Arts Section Explains Three Reasons; Protest Likely Illegitimate <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>The men's wrestling finals, divided into heavy, medium, and light weight classes, were completed yesterday morning, with six finalists chosen from each class. However, the Beiping City representatives protested to the National Arts Section yesterday afternoon regarding the medium weight champion, Bu Enfu (contestant number 1528) from Hebei Province.</p>
<p>Bu Enfu, originally paired with Zuo Xiwu (contestant number 1673) from Shandong Province, failed to respond to the roll call by an official with a Southern accent during the first preliminary round on the afternoon of the 11th. The referee on site initially assumed he had forfeited the match. The Hebei team leader later discovered that Bu did not understand the accent and explained this to Referee-in-Chief Chu Minyi. Chu initially stated that, according to the rules, it should be considered a forfeit. However, since the national martial arts were still in a developmental stage, the primary goal was to promote the sport. Therefore, leniency was granted, and Bu was allowed to participate in the next round. Fortunately, after the next round, there would be further matches including the semi-finals, the second semi-finals, and the finals, and the victors were not difficult to judge. Unexpectedly, Bu won the championship during yesterday's final, leading to dissatisfaction from the Beiping City representatives, who lodged a protest with the National Arts Section yesterday afternoon. Referee-in-Chief Chu Minyi, upon receiving the protest, detailed the reasons for allowing Bu to participate in the second round and sent the information to the Judging Committee. The Beiping team's letter of protest and the National Arts Section's explanation are transcribed below:</p>
<p>Beiping Team's Letter of Protest</p>
<p>To whom it may concern:</p>
<p>Contestant number 1528 and 1673 were drawn together for the medium weight class in men's wrestling and should have competed. However, contestant 1528 did not appear during the preliminary round. According to the special rules of the competition, this should be considered a forfeit. Yet, contestant 1528 reappeared in the semi-finals and participated in the competition. Our unit finds this difficult to accept and therefore submits this protest. We request a reply.</p>
<p>Beiping Representative Team (October 16)</p>
<p>National Arts Section's Explanation</p>
<p>In response to the protest letter from the Beiping Representative Team, the reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In men's wrestling, Hebei Province contestant number 1528 participated in every match from the preliminary round to the finals. However, during the roll call of the preliminary round, he did not respond because of the accent, despite being present. The Hebei Province martial arts instructor, Hao, noticed and requested the referee-in-chief to resolve the matter. Referee Chu ruled that the contestant's failure to respond was due to a peculiar dialect and should not be considered a forfeit. Therefore, he permitted the contestant to participate in the second round. The statement in the protest letter that "[Bu] did not appear" is likely a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>(2) The special rules of the competition only apply to track and field, all-around sports, swimming, and ball games. Martial arts competitions have their own specific rules. Article 12 of the martial arts rules stipulates that "failure to appear at the specified competition time will be considered a forfeit." However, the contestant was indeed present at the wrestling competition. His failure to respond was due to a different dialect, so he cannot be considered absent and therefore cannot be considered to have forfeited. Furthermore, Article 13, section 2 stipulates that "contestants must not leave the arena arbitrarily after assembly; otherwise, failure to appear when one's turn comes will still be considered a forfeit." The contestant assembled with the other competitors and did not leave the arena. Therefore, he cannot be considered to have forfeited.</p>
<p>(3) Article 40 of Chapter 21 of the competition regulations stipulates that "legitimate protests in competitions should be formally submitted in writing, signed and stamped by the head of each unit, to the Jury Committee within one hour after the conclusion of the event." The representative team did not lodge a protest during the preliminary round, nor during the semi-finals or the second semi-finals. Only after the completion of the finals and after the ranking of the winners had been determined, after several days, did they lodge a protest. This is likely inconsistent with the regulations. Furthermore, the protest letter does not contain the signature or seal of the team leader. It is questionable whether it can be considered a legitimate protest.</p>
<p>The wrestling finals results are attached for your reference. We hope this is appropriate.</p>
<p>Submitted to the Jury Committee,</p>
<p>Chu Minyi, National Arts Section (October 16)</p>
<p>Protest Unlikely to Stand</p>
<p>Zhang Boling, Chairman of the Judging Committee, after receiving the above explanation and the Beiping team's letter of protest, believes the facts are very clear and the National Arts Section acted appropriately. He stated that there was no need to convene a meeting that evening. Mr. Li, the team leader of the Beiping team, visited Referee-in-Chief Chu Minyi at the National Arts Section in the afternoon. After Chu explained the reasons in detail, Mr. Li realized that the matter was due to a misunderstanding. He immediately returned to the team and explained Chu's reasoning to the athletes. Based on the above situation, the protest is unlikely to stand.</p>
<p>Men's Wrestling Finals Results</p>
<p>The men's wrestling finals were held at the National Arts Arena on the morning of the 16th. The wrestlers arrived on time and stood around the arena. This was the final act of wrestling. Victory or defeat would be decided here, so each wrestler watched intently, donned their battle gear, warmed up and prepared to fight their hardest to win the final victory. Therefore, it was one of the most exciting matches. Ma Wenkui, the strongman from Nanjing, entered the arena with the momentum of his previous victories. Hu Huanbin from Shandong challenged him, but Hu knew he was no match for Ma and voluntarily forfeited. Although Zhang Wenshan, the large man from Beiping, had been defeated by Ma before, he had recovered his strength after a night's rest. He first faced Hu Huanbin from Shandong. Hu was also unwilling to show weakness and fought two rounds without a clear winner. However, in the third and fourth matches, Zhang used all his strength to twist Hu to the ground. Therefore, the large man remained in second place. Tan Zuxiu of the light weight class and Bu Enfu of the middle weight class also fought valiantly and won the final victory. The winning rankings are recorded below:</p>

<p>Individual Weapon Finals</p>
<p>The National Arts individual weapon finals, divided into men's and women's groups, were held at the National Arts Arena on the afternoon of the 16th. All less skilled athletes were eliminated, and those participating in the finals were elite. In the women's group, He Xiuyuan from Nanjing performed the Kunwu sword, moving with orderly steps and wielding the sword with great agility. In the men's group, Wang Zizhang from Shandong and Wei Fengde from Shaanxi performed Taiji sword and Taiji spear, respectively. The names were similar, and their scores were also comparable. After evaluation by the judges, their total scores were both 124.3 points. Referee Chu decided that they would perform again on the 17th so that the judges could make a more precise judgment and determine the final ranking.</p>
<p>Women's Group</p>
<p>Rank | Name | Weapon | Unit</p>
<p>1st | He Xiuyuan | Kunwu Sword | Jing (Nanjing)</p>
<p>2nd | Zhang Qie | Eight Trigram Sword | Ping (Beiping)</p>

<p>5th | Zhang Baozhong | Bagua Double Swords | Ping (Beiping)</p>
<p>6th | Lu Zhanyuan | Da Li Flower Spear | Ping (Beiping)</p>
<p>Note: Because Wang Zizhang and Wei Fengde had the same score, the order cannot be determined until after the opponent's weapon finals this afternoon.</p>
<p>Free Weapon and Fist Performance</p>
<p>After the individual weapon finals for men and women, there was still time. Referee Chu, in order to satisfy the audience's interest, specially invited martial arts instructors and athletes from various regions to freely perform various sword, spear, stick, and fist techniques for two hours. The performances were brilliant, and the applause was thunderous. In particular, the fist techniques of the two children from the Beiping Minzhong Martial Arts School, and the group fist routines of the Hunan martial arts team led by Zhu Guozhen, such as attacking Tongbei, Xingyi Eight Postures, Tongbei Liuhe, and Baji, were most outstanding. The group sword routines, such as the Bagua sword and the Xingyi Duishi sword, were also very impressive. The performances concluded at around 5 PM.</p>
<p>Mongolian Wrestling Team Returned North Yesterday</p>
<p>The Mongolian wrestling team, consisting of 11 members, was invited to the games to give wrestling performances. They originally planned to stay in Shanghai for a few more days and prepare to perform in the capital. However, they were not accustomed to the climate and felt unwell. Therefore, they took the Pinghu train back north yesterday morning. Chu Minyi, the head of the National Arts Section, personally went to the station to see them off.</p>

<h3 id="e241">First Sound of Small Football Performance: Shanghai Defeats Hubei <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>Hubei Leads in the First Half, Shanghai Comes Back to Win in the Second Half; Shanghai-Hong Kong Representative Teams Final Battle on the 20th Should Be Even More Exciting</p>
<p>The small football exhibition game was held at 3:00 PM yesterday on the tennis court inside the track and field stadium. The Shanghai mixed team played against Hubei. The players from Hubei were mostly veterans, while the Shanghai team was a mixture of elite players from various teams. Both sides were evenly matched, and the performance was quite exciting. As a result, Shanghai won 5-3. The battle situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>Hubei Leads in the First Half</p>
<p>The game started at 3 o'clock. With a whistle from referee Zhang Leyin, both sides entered the battle. The Hubei players were brave and extraordinary. Xiao Jiangchao was stationed in the central area, looking majestic. The vanguards Huang and Huang Guorong were agile and unpredictable. The Shanghai team's players all had unique personal techniques. Unfortunately, because the team was hastily assembled from the best players from each team, the coordination was lacking. At the beginning of the game, Hubei's Huang Jian received a pass in the middle and scored with a sweeping kick, opening the scoring. The Shanghai team tried hard to counterattack, probing several times. Wu Qixiang was able to turn danger into safety, remaining calm. Then, Deng Zhiyang launched an attack from the left flank and passed the ball to Huang Guorong, who scored again with a light touch. After Hubei scored two goals in a row, their momentum surged. The Shanghai team's players worked hard to counterattack. Zhang Jinhai ran quickly, and Li Zushou bravely broke through two checkpoints. Wang Zishou received a pass and took advantage of the enemy team's chaotic formation to score a goal. After a stalemate, the first half ended, with Hubei leading 2-1.</p>
<p>Shanghai Comes Back to Win in the Second Half</p>
<p>After a short break, the teams switched sides and fought again. The Shanghai team's players had improved their coordination after half an hour of play. Within a few minutes of the start, Li Zushou scored two goals in a row, putting Shanghai in the lead 3-2. The Hubei team desperately counterattacked. Tang Zhulin's iron gate was well-deserved. Yu and Shen, the two defenders, also performed their duties well, so the Hubei team could not find an opening for a long time. In the midst of the confusion, Wang Zishou secretly attacked, and Cao Qinfang received a pass in the midfield. Wang Dekang saw the fierce attack and rushed forward but missed. Wang Zishou took the opportunity to shoot another goal, which went into the net. Hubei lost three goals in a row. Seeing that the situation was hopeless, each player did not dare to slack off. Huang Guorong lived up to expectations and pulled back a goal, making the score 4-3. As the game time was coming to an end, the competition between the two sides became fierce, and the performance became particularly exciting. Huang Qinfang of the Shanghai team stole the camp and attacked the stronghold, penetrating deep into the enemy's formation. After a few passes, he was near the enemy's goal. He kicked the ball towards the corner of the goal, and Weng Kefa failed to save it. Another goal was lost. The game ended, and Shanghai won 5-3, reversing the defeat. There is one more small football exhibition game, which is the battle between the Shanghai City representative team and Hong Kong. It is scheduled to be held on the 20th. Li Yichen, Xu Jingcheng, and Cao Qiuting will all play for Shanghai. Li Qiuwang from Hong Kong will also participate. The performance will be more exciting and should surpass yesterday's game. The line-ups are recorded below:</p>

<p>The uniforms of the Liaoning athletes participating in this National Games are very simple, with white shirts and black trousers. This is very different from the red and green worn by other units. Can you guess what the black and white colors represent? Does it make you feel sad?</p>
<p>Shanxi Surprises with Five Event Wins</p>
<p>Ji Maode, a veteran from Shanxi, surprisingly won five event championships in this National Games. This shows that sports are gradually developing in the interior.</p>
<p>Many Spectators for Small Football</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were no fewer than several thousand spectators watching the exhibition game between Hubei and Shanghai small football. The north and south stands were packed. This shows Shanghai's enthusiastic attention to small football competitions.</p>
<p>Tall Man Watching Basketball with Short Man</p>
<p>Yesterday, during the basketball semi-final rematch between Hebei and Guangdong at the gymnasium, Zhang Xihu, a tall former Zhejiang athlete, happened to meet a short man from the Hebei team. The two shook hands and exchanged greetings at the entrance, which was very interesting. The audience surrounded them spontaneously.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Special Feature on Female Athletes <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai women's basketball stars, Ms. Chen Rongming and Chen Rongtang, are both exceptionally strong and have superb basketball skills. People often mistakenly think they are a pair of sisters. In fact, one was born in Sichuan and the other is from Fujian. They have the same surname but different ancestors.</p>
<p>Ms. Pang Yuanyu from Changshu made a sensation at the previous Jiangsu Provincial Games. Unexpectedly, in this National Games, in addition to winning fifth place in the high jump, she failed in other events such as the 100-meter sprint and the long jump. She has been staying home recently and rarely goes out.</p>
<p>Some people who have seen the signature of sprinter Li Sen feel that her writing is free and experienced. Few knew that Ms. Li put in a lot of effort to practice her signature. It is said that she practiced for several years, so her writing is so skilled. Believe it or not.</p>
<p>The two mermaid sisters, Yang Xiuyi and Yang Xiuzhen, are often accompanied by Chen Yingxing and Liang Weisheng. No wonder Li Huitang also often walks alongside Liang. Unaware people often mistakenly think they are a pair of lovers. After the Shanxi women's tennis expert, Ms. Wang Chun, lost the singles match to Shanghai player Wei Maigu, Ms. Wang sighed loudly. Her expression was delicate and her performance was very good.</p>
<p>Some people say that the female athletes from Guangdong are petite, the female athletes from Hong Kong are healthy and beautiful, the female athletes from Shandong are strong, and the female athletes from Shanghai are "black and beautiful." Female athletes like to eat snacks, especially candy, such as Durian and chocolate, which are very good for digestion. Also, Liangxiang chestnuts and spiced beans are also very profitable.</p>
<p>To meet female athletes in the female dormitory, you must fill out a visitor form; otherwise, you will be rejected. According to the dormitory staff, from morning to night, the number of visitors exceeds several hundred. Among these hundreds of people, most are young men in suits. Guangdong's Ms. Zhang Jieqiong took the 50-meter championship from Li Sen and broke her 6.9-second record. Ms. Zhang's eyes went straight with anger. Ms. Zhang told reporters yesterday that "a gentleman will take revenge in three years." She will show her what she's got at the 7th National Games.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Poolside Anecdotes <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>Chaos When the Mermaid Enters the Arena: Whenever Yang Xiuqiong enters the arena to compete, the audience cheers loudly and stands up to see her true face. The order is disrupted. The spectators in the west stands shout, "Can't see, please sit down!" non-stop.</p>
<p>Shanghai Athletes Look Like Male Nurses: The Shanghai team athletes all wear white bathrobes, with only the words "Shanghai City" sewn on the back. An old man in the stands said, "This looks a bit like male nurses in a hospital."</p>
<p>Athletes Wait for the Starter, Mr. Guan: Yesterday, before the start of the fifth group of the men's 200-meter breaststroke, the starter went into the gate and walked down the corridor for some business. As a result, the athletes waited for a long time. Finally, the announcer shouted, "Mr. Starter, please return to your post quickly!" Then we saw Guan hurry back.</p>
<p>What Does Neither Male nor Female Look Like? Yesterday, the weather suddenly became hot, which was unprecedented after the start of the season. The audience shouted, "It's so hot! It's so hot!" For a moment, the women had no umbrellas to avoid the sun, so they put them on the heads of the men who came with them. An elderly person said, "What does this look like, neither male nor female?"</p>
<p>Modern Women Become Consular Officials: The weather was very hot yesterday, and modern women were complaining about the heat. For a moment, they could not think of any way to solve it. On the command platform, it was discovered that two modern women were wearing paper hats folded from newspapers in the shape of long boats to block the sun. The two ends of the hat were pointed, and wearing them looked a bit like the hats worn by consuls. Therefore, for a moment, there were quite a few modern women who became consular officials.</p>
<p>Fierce Competition, Referee Surprised: When the second group of the men's 50-meter semi-final took place, the competition between the athletes was very fierce. When they reached the finish line, it was suddenly difficult to distinguish the victors. The chief referee at the finish line was shocked and issued his command red flag to notify the referees to pay attention.</p>
<p>Guo Zhenheng Truly Lives Up to Expectations: Guo Zhenheng, who was once famous, entered the arena yesterday for the third group of the men's 200-meter breaststroke preliminary round. The female athletes from Guangdong on the poolside cheered for him with all their might. As a result, he lived up to expectations, finishing with a time of 3 minutes and 8.7 seconds, the best time in yesterday's six groups.</p>
<p>Two Gunshots Distressed the Athletes: During the first group of the 50-meter semi-final, an athlete made a false start, and the starter fired the second gun, ordering the athletes to return. However, because the first and second shots were fired in succession, some athletes thought nothing of it, resulting in two athletes strenuously moving forward. Although the staff shouted for them to come back, it was ineffective. Finally, they found a way to have the referees order them to stop, but they had already reached the finish line and protested endlessly. The starter was very understanding and specially postponed the race for ten minutes.</p>
<p>Big Cat Li Sen Visits the Swimming Competition: In the middle of the competition, Big Cat accompanied Li Sen and another male track and field athlete to sit in the 1.5 yuan seats and watch the battle. Li Sen was wearing a blue turned-down collar shirt and white suspender trousers, with a light red sports coat draped over his shoulders. He answered questions and seemed very pleased.</p>

<p>The Sixth National Games, the 16th, was the seventh day. The audience from all walks of life is increasingly crowded. It is learned that for the convenience of the audience, from now on, all private cars can drive directly to the outside of the wire fence of the venue to get off. However, after the audience gets off, the cars must still be parked in the Zheng Yi Road parking lot for private cars designated by the organizing committee.</p>

Mayor Wu and Director Pan will be invited to attend and deliver speeches to the guests. Officials and staff of the National Games and the press will be present. The association originally intended to entertain all athletes, but due to the lack of suitable locations in Shanghai, it had to specialize in entertaining female athletes.</p>

Meal allowances will be distributed on the spot, and gifts will be forwarded.

<h3 id="e252">An Interview with Muslim Athletes <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>Representatives of the Chinese Islamic Cultural Association, the Humanitarian Monthly Magazine, and other Islamic organizations, in order to host a banquet for Muslim athletes from various provinces and cities, departed from the Zhejiang Road Mosque at 8 AM yesterday. They first went to the Chunhua Lou Halal Restaurant in the venue to inquire about the number of Muslim athletes. As they did not get the desired information, they wrote several notices and posted them at the entrances of various Islamic centers so that the athletes could be aware. They also exchanged pleasantries with Mr. Ma, the father of Ma Ruilan, a female sharpshooter (who was a martial arts champion of the Qing Dynasty). The representatives explained their intentions. According to Mr. Ma, there are about eighty Muslims participating in this National Games, including dozens from Henan, including several girls. At that time, strongman Wang Ziping and others also arrived, and the intentions were explained again. Mr. Wang and others then introduced the representatives to Mr. Hai Jifang, the top marksman, and explained their intentions. They had already known about it and said they had seen the news in the newspaper. The task of checking the number of Muslim athletes here was entrusted to them. Later, the representatives met with seven or eight athletes from Xinjiang and explained their intentions, which was met with great joy. Later, the representatives went to the dormitories of the athletes from various provinces and cities to visit and were helped by non-Muslim athletes from various teams to meet with Muslim athletes. Muslim male and female athletes came from more than a dozen provinces, totaling about a hundred people. At the same time, for the convenience of the reception, the representatives decided to host a banquet at the Chunhua Lou Halal Restaurant in the National Games venue at 5 PM on the 18th and invited Mr. Ma Renfu, the leader of the Henan Province martial arts team, to coordinate with athletes from various regions in modern times.</p>

<p>The result of the National Table Tennis Competition after two finals is still a triangular situation. The match between Shanghai and Macau almost ended unhappily due to a misunderstanding. Fortunately, the Shanghai team took the overall situation into consideration and reluctantly sacrificed themselves. However, if Macau could defeat Jiangsu, they could have taken the large silver cup back to the south. Unfortunately, they were defeated, and the championship dream was temporarily shattered. It remains to be seen who will emerge victorious between the Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Macau teams. The replay will be scheduled separately and held at the Central Auditorium.

<h3 id="e257">Defeated by Beiping 6-10, Hebei Ranked Fourth <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>Evenly Matched, Tense Situation, Shanghai and Guangdong to Compete in the Finals Tomorrow</p>
<p>In the baseball championship, Beiping played against Hebei yesterday for the third and fourth places. Beiping scored ten points with fifteen hits, defeating Hebei, who was relegated to fourth place. Tomorrow afternoon, Beiping will play against the losing team of the finals for the second and third places. The umpire yesterday was Liu Dacheng, the base umpires were Hou Luoxun, and the recorder was Li Xijun. The score was ten to six, with Beiping winning. The pitcher for Beiping was Gu Zhiwei, followed by Luo Zongxing. The pitcher for Hebei was Zhang Minhui, followed by Gong Qingzong.</p>
<p>Liao Fu's Hit Creates Two Points</p>
<p>Beiping initially used Xu Xiliang to fight, which was unsuccessful and withdrawn. Chen Maohua then took the field, base-running, stealing bases. Chen took the opportunity to reach third base, and Gu Zhiwei also safely reached first base. In the next round, Liao Fu hit a powerful hit. Chen Maohua and Gu Zhiwei, who were on the bases, returned safely to the bases. Although he did not succeed in achieving his goal due to the obstruction of later players, he was instrumental in Beiping's initial score of one point, which made a great contribution to the team. Hebei continued to attack, and all three players were shut out. In the first inning, Beiping scored two points, and Hebei scored one point. In the second inning, Hebei's momentum gradually increased. After three players from Beiping retired, Zhang Huimin safely hit first base. The pitcher from Beiping made a mistake in throwing, and Guan Yingdi did not occupy the base, with the enemy at third base. The situation was serious. Fang Zheng hit a low, fast ground ball, and Zhang returned to the base. Hebei then occupied all three bases. Unexpectedly, the subsequent hitters had difficulty entering the gate, and the dangerous situation subsided.</p>
<p>Equal Strength, Mutual Display of Skills</p>
<p>The third inning was the most dangerous of all innings, and it was also a display of the skills of both sides. Xu Xiliang of Beiping safely hit first base. Chen Maohua hit a high ball, which the center fielder missed. Xu advanced to second base, and Chen occupied first base. Hebei gave Gu Zhiwei a base, and Xu and Chen each advanced a base. All three bases were full. Liao Fu suddenly hit a double, and Xu, Chen, and Gu all returned. Gu Tingchang then hit a base hit, and Liao also returned to the base. Fortunately, the pitcher and third baseman of Hebei cooperated to make a double play. Gu Tingchang and Yu Mingxin of Beiping were ambushed, and the situation calmed down. Beiping scored four points in total. It was then Hebei's turn to bat. Chen Bingshou safely reached first base and secretly stole second base. Luo Zongqiang ran and stole to first base, and Chen reached third base. Zhang Minhui hit a triple, and Chen and Luo both returned. Zhang took advantage of the opponent's confusion and returned via third base. All three Hebei players who took the field managed to return, turning defeat into victory. The reliance on this inning was due to the continuous occurrence of "three strikeouts," which ultimately led to the loss of opportunity. In the third inning, Beiping scored four points, and Hebei scored three points.</p>
<p>After a Fierce Battle of Nine Innings, the Superior Team Ultimately Wins</p>
<p>Beiping has average talent and stronger strength. It took the lead in the first three innings and maintained its advantage in the last six innings. There was no progress in the fourth inning. In the fifth inning, Beiping had four consecutive hits, but only Gu Tingchang returned. The others were ambushed before returning to the base. In the sixth inning, Gu Zhiwei's hit from Beiping sent Xu Xiliang back to the base. Beiping added another point. Hebei made no progress in these fifth and sixth innings. The seventh inning was again a relative situation. Beiping had a total of three hits, and Yu Mingxin and Xu Xifan returned to the base. Hebei had one hit, and Chen Bingshou and Luo Zongqiang also returned to the base. In the following two innings, the offense and defense were tight, and neither team achieved its goals. As a result, Beiping won Hebei by ten to six.</p>

<h3 id="e258">Another Puppet State to be Established in East Africa <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>—Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Although the League of Nations has determined that Italy is the aggressor in the East African war and has resolved to implement sanctions against Italy under Article 16 of the Covenant, this move will not deter Mussolini or change his military actions. According to recent news from Rome, officials have openly stated that Mussolini plans to establish a new country within a portion of Abyssinian territory, with Gefchai, the former governor of Tigre province who recently surrendered to the Italian army with 12,000 men, as the puppet emperor of the country. This piece of news, although very bland, is more attention-grabbing than those war reports of occupying land and dropping bombs.</p>
<p>Speaking of the establishment of a new country and the emergence of a puppet emperor, it is not unique to the occupation of East Africa. Three years ago, there was such a miracle in East Asia. However, perhaps this farce will be played out again in East Africa by another group of characters. It is truly a coincidence. It turns out that the great powers of today do not want to bear the name of being an aggressor, so in order to deceive the world, they have come up with a clever method: to establish a new country in the occupied territory and then find someone to be the puppet leader of the new country, while they secretly hide behind the scenes and direct the operation. If anyone tries to interfere at this time, they will say that this is a "fait accompli" and that it has nothing to do with them, leaving you unable to deal with it. This strategy was tested by someone three years ago and was successful, achieving the desired result. Therefore, Italy now wants to follow suit and plans to use this trick.</p>
<p>However, to support a puppet as emperor is also a difficult task. Because not just anyone is qualified to be a puppet emperor. You must find someone with a special background. Everyone knows that the puppet emperor of East Asia is the most qualified person. This future puppet emperor of East Africa, although he has no blood relation with the Abyssinian king, claims to be a descendant of John IV, who ruled Abyssinia from 1872 to 1899. This resume is also more than qualified. No wonder a Roman newspaper, after Gefchai's defection to Italy, headlined "A Legitimate Heir to the Throne Has Rebelled Against the Usurper in the Abyssinian Capital," saying that Gefchai was a direct descendant of the new Solomon king and that former King Menelik and current King Haile Selassie were all usurpers. Moreover, some newspapers pointed out that when King Emmanuel III of Italy inspected Eritrea in 1932, he met with the major chiefs of Tigre province, including Gefchai, who at that time requested preferential treatment from Italy and expressed his obedience to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini.</p>
<p>Gefchai's betrayal of the Abyssinian king is very beneficial to Italy. The Italian military headquarters believes that this is a sign of military victory. It is said that with his cooperation, the Italian army will advance south to cut off the Jiji Railway, and there will be no major obstacles. If other chiefs come to surrender, the time required to conquer Abyssinia can be greatly reduced. In this way, a new country in East Africa may soon be established. And the traitor Gefchai can become its puppet king.</p>
<h3 id="e259">Filling Out the Form <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>—Da</p>
<p>Huang Zhixing was walking staggeringly along the slender asphalt road under the emerald green shade of palm trees, constantly touching his hot, feverish cheeks with his right hand. The black, charcoal-like foreigners who brushed past him, with their gleaming, sly eyes, seemed to Huang Zhixing today to contain a hint of insult and contempt. This made him hate the foreigners even more. He clenched his fists and angrily hit the palm of his left hand, muttering to himself furiously:</p>
<p>"Damn it, I really don't want to stay in this stinking place anymore! -- Who says you'll starve to death if you don't make a living in this stinking place?" The fire in his heart was burning fiercely, like the blazing sun in the sky.</p>
<p>Huang Zhixing was a young man in his twenties. After graduating from secondary school, in order to alleviate the burden on his family and help with part of the family's finances, he had to leave his hometown and float to the southern country to live a life of hardship. However, in recent years, overseas Chinese education in foreign countries has been subjected to various harsh restrictions and difficulties by the resident government. This hardship is very difficult to endure, especially for those who teach here. The prerequisite is to be able to read the strange foreign characters that look like Tibetan, and pass their strict examinations before you can succeed!</p>
<p>When he was painstakingly studying the strange foreign characters under the lamp every day, a feeling of anger always welled up in his heart, as if a raging flame was rising, and he thought, "Why do I have to read this damn language? I don't want to teach their foreign language!"</p>
<p>However, for the sake of life, Huang Zhixing had to suppress the raging fire in his heart and bury his head to read on stubbornly.</p>
<p>Today, early in the morning, Principal Zhou rushed into the teachers' dormitory, his mouth wide open and his eyes narrowed into a line with a smile. It looked like something exciting was happening. As soon as he rushed in, he shouted loudly:</p>
<p>"Xiao Huang, congratulations! The Ministry of Education has sent an official letter saying that you have passed the foreign language exam. You just need to go to the Ministry later to fill out a form."</p>
<p>"Hmm..." He nodded his head slightly.</p>
<p>He was completely immersed in past memories. He remembered that he had been teaching here for a full half a year. During this half year, he had been living a life of secrecy, which was naturally because he had not yet passed the foreign language exam. He remembered that once, he was lecturing on Chinese composition on the platform. When he was getting into the swing of things, suddenly a tea servant rushed in in a hurry, stuttering: "Mr. Huang, the inspectors... the inspectors... are here!" So he hurriedly stepped down from the platform and slipped away. Another senior student who could understand the foreign language stood on the platform to take his place. Such a farce had been played out countless times in the past half year. Now he was finally qualified to be a teacher, and from now on he was finally a publicly recognized prostitute, no longer having to grope around secretly in the dark. Thinking of this, he couldn't help but smile slightly.</p>
<p>After eating breakfast, Huang Zhixing dressed neatly and went to the Ministry of Education. He sat alone in the reception room, waiting patiently. The clock on the top of the door ticked slowly, and after three hours, he felt that none of the education officials with their "running dragons" (skirt-like lower garments) walking outside noticed his existence. So the fire in his heart was burning again, "Damn it, I really don't have the patience to eat this bowl of rice!" That's what was echoing in his heart.</p>
<p>Suddenly, half a charcoal-like head poked out from the small door and asked:</p>
<p>"What do you want, Chinese?" In a nonchalant and arrogant tone.</p>
<p>"Filling out a form." He replied faintly.</p>
<p>"Come in." He handed him a form.</p>
<p>From his name and place of origin to "Have you ever committed a crime?" and "Do you dare to guarantee that you will not violate the government's affairs?" Huang Zhixing patiently filled out these insulting clauses, even though the more he filled out, the more his soul was stabbed and hurt unbearably. Finally, it came to stamping more than ten fingerprints.</p>
<p>"Why do you have to stamp fingerprints?" Huang Zhixing asked a little unconvinced.</p>
<p>"Who dares to guarantee you low-class Chinese?" He laughed ferociously and contemptuously.</p>
<p>"You are the low-class ones!..." The anger that had been suppressed could no longer be held back, and it erupted like a volcano.</p>
<p>"Slap... slap..." Two heavy slaps were delivered. "Dog, get out of here, you low-class thing! Are you qualified to be a teacher? Do you know what this place is?... Get out!"</p>
<p>"Damn it, I really don't want to stay in this filthy place anymore!..." He angrily twisted the form into a ball and threw it on the ground with all his might, and walked out of the gate of the Ministry of Education without looking back.</p>
<p>Huang Zhixing was walking staggeringly under the emerald green shade of palm trees, constantly touching his hot, feverish cheeks with his right hand. He felt that those black, charcoal-like foreigners who brushed past him, with their gleaming eyes, all contained a hint of insult, contempt, and hostility towards him.</p>
<h3 id="e260">Blind Singer <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>—Liang Qiyun</p>
<p>The blind singer Afeng has a destiny like duckweed - wandering, drifting. How sad it is to live a life of uncertainty, floating on the water.</p>
<p>She flowed from the village to the town, and from the town to the metropolis. She has understood how simple, resolute, and calm the customs of the north are; and how beautiful, charming, and gentle the scenery of the south is. But she also knows that life is hard and bitter. Therefore, as time goes by, drifting is as natural to her as eating is to everyone.</p>
<p>The story of the Gypsies is beautiful: but her heart is melancholy...</p>
<p>It is said that art can move people's hearts. Afeng has never been to school, and has been blind since she was twelve years old, so she doesn't understand what art is at all. However, she is deeply honored to be welcomed everywhere instead of being hated because of her physical defects.</p>
<p>That night, the sky was exceptionally clear.</p>
<p>The bright waning moon in late autumn was on its way to its endless journey in the pure, light ink-colored sky.</p>
<p>The stars twinkled with shining eyes.</p>
<p>Afeng's eyes had not twinkled for six years. -- Fallen black dots.</p>
<p>At the wedding banquet in the Daya Restaurant, a guest (who had been moved by Afeng's art) proposed to adorn a small blue flower among the thousands of red and green flowers, which would have a special flavor.</p>
<p>So, these hundred or so vulgar people got to hear the moving art of the blind singer once again.</p>
<p>Afeng came.</p>
<p>A handsome, tall tree, her body wrapped in a deep purple dress. Many people sighed and regretted:</p>
<p>-- Why is she missing a pair of shining stars?</p>
<p>The short, thin opium-addict-like Cen made a prelude to the tune. Then, the blind singer opened her mouth. "Farewell My Concubine", what a generous, impassioned, and sentimental tune. The sound of the zither and the song were spinning in the silent air, which was suppressed with emotions, almost suffocating. ...</p>
<p>The sound of the song was like a wave, and people's moods were like the waves, rising and falling together.</p>
<p>When people's emotions reached the most intense peak, suddenly, the song ended. Then, many people's emotions seemed to suddenly fall into an ice cellar under the hot sun. Everyone who had been holding their breath in their hearts was finally able to relax.</p>
<p>People who sympathized with her sighed for her again.</p>
<p>(Yes, what a pity. An eighteen-year-old girl, because of her physical defects, has lost the joy of youth that nature has given her. Now, she is selling her own emotions, and hiding the sorrow in the depths of her heart.</p>
<p>(-- Loneliness, wandering, drifting, the resentment of youth,...</p>
<p>(The sorrow of a single person.)</p>
<p>Then, in the praising applause of the people, she left. And, she left a melancholy smile for everyone.</p>
<p>Perhaps she pretended to be happy, not letting others know the secret grievances in her heart. --</p>
<p>She, the blind singer Afeng, has a destiny like duckweed.</p>
<p>-- Wandering, drifting How sad it is to live a life of uncertainty, floating on the water.</p>
<p>But she needs to drift, just as everyone needs to eat.</p>
<p>Therefore, although the story of the Gypsies is magical; her heart will always be melancholy...</p>

<p>Opening: "Spring Chamber's Morning Thoughts"</p>
<p>The rising sun reflects upon the small pavilion, adorning the embroidered boudoir with spring slumber. The song of the oriole startles the lingering dreams on the winding path, sitting alone in a solitary quilt, feeling the chill of the morning. Hastily arranging her disheveled hair, her beautiful face separated by powder. Slowly tying her silk skirt, her slender waist feeling the looseness of the belt. Embroidered flowers adorn her three-inch lotus shoes, with red tips peeking from the green silk leggings. Lightly stepping, she approaches the window, first raising the beaded curtain. She sees only the tender green on the branches, glistening with dew from the overnight rain, and cheerful spring birds frolicking in the woods. A range of green mountains stretches into the distant peaks, kites flying towards the white clouds. The solitary pagoda shadow stretches high in the vast sky, the constant sound of gongs filling the air, a lively autumn festival. Red peach blossoms by the courtyard hold the overnight dew, green willows sway with the morning mist. The sound of flower vendors beckons from the street ahead, butterfly-like women with wine and powder dance before the window. Never tiring of the many spring scenes, she then sits at her dressing table to arrange her beautiful face. Preferring fragrant orchids to idle flowers, she adorns her hair with a jade hairpin. Gazing at her reflection, she sees a captivating beauty, like an immortal banished from the lunar palace. Ten thousand measures of sorrow weigh heavily on her heart, most fearing that beauty brings a difficult fate. She is naturally of unparalleled beauty, with skin like ice and bones like jade, but sadly, she is not yet engaged. Fearing she lacks the talent to attract a worthy husband, she cannot predict the year of her marriage. Even if she eventually enters the bridal chamber after the wedding, she fears a violent storm will break the paired lotus flowers. Thinking back and forth, her worries increase, her fate resting in the confines of her chamber, at the mercy of heaven. All things are beyond human planning, and the red dust is but a dream. Life is futile if not enjoyed.</p>

<p>It is said that Miss Yu Xueli of the Meiling Troupe has withdrawn from the group. (To be verified.)</p>
<p>Amateur piano virtuoso Miss Jiang Lingdi, is currently twenty-nine years old, is from Jiangsu, and is amiable and kind. Her singing truly possesses the sound of orioles and birds, and the broadcasting world will gain an outstanding new talent.</p>
<p>Among the singing groups in the broadcasting world now, the widest scope is the Mingyue Society, the lowest is the Mingmei Troupe, the largest number of members is the veteran Yanyan Society, the smallest is the Dingxiang Society, the best is the Shanghai Society, and the worst are the Bailaomen Society and the Hawaiian Society.</p>
<p>It is said that Mr. Wu Ruijun, the chief editor of a certain newspaper in Hankou, has recently been dissatisfied with by all sectors of the city, and there is talk of deporting him. (To be verified.) The reason is that he exclusively promotes modern young girls and attacks others in the newspaper.</p>
<p>The old-brand Meihua Concert was indeed founded in the spring of 1932 by Mr. Ma Tinglong and Mr. Liu Mohong. The band of the association all have Western conductors, and the results are satisfactory and truly satisfying to all sectors. The association has undergone several reorganizations due to the occupational relationships of its members, and the association is amateur in nature, and has participated in various school recreational gatherings, and there are newspapers and publications from 1932, 33, and 34 that can prove it. It is truly an old-brand Meihua Concert. All sectors should pay attention. It is heard that someone recently bought the name of the association and is preparing to broadcast a great program.

<p>Someone recently called Miss Yu Xueli of the Meiling Troupe a reckless social butterfly. (Meaning unknown.)</p>
<p>The singing of the Mingmei Troupe is okay, but it's a pity that the musicians lack experience.</p>
<p>Recently, there have been rumors that the sisters Yan Fei, Lin Ying, and Ye Hong are going to Taiwan, and there have also been rumors that they are going to Suzhou, but these are not true. Amateur singing star Miss Gu Huihong, is currently twenty years old, is fluent in literature and writing, and is indeed a leader in the broadcasting world. Miss Jiang Yunyu is sixteen years old, is lively and clever, and is good at singing. Both are proficient in piano. The New Brand Yanyan Society once changed its name to Yanyan Society in this newspaper due to the name of the old brand Yanyan Society. It has now been changed to Shanghai Yanyan Society, so please do not misunderstand.</p>
<p>The Rhine Society on Yasheng Radio from 4:30 PM to 5:15 PM, was originally named the Xiaguang Society. They report as the Rhine Society on the radio, but promote themselves as the Xiaguang Society outside. Its purpose is unknown. (Above from Xinminshe)</p>
<p>A certain Mr. Hu, the leader of the Songfeng Troupe, received broadcast advertising fees and also swindled the mandolin from the troupe members and fled. Two months later, the leader of the Qunying Troupe, a certain Snake, also collected advertising fees and also swindled the mandolin from the troupe members and fled. One took the mandolin, and one took the mandolin. All that's missing is a piano, otherwise, it could be established as an "evil country" or "monster gathering society," etc.</p>
<p>"A person who called himself Hu Jie (or Wu Jie), who loves music, saw an advertisement for the Nightingale Society recruiting members, so he signed up. After the test, the reply was 'The piano playing technique is not up to par' and he was rejected." At a banquet one day, Chen, who runs the radio station, told me this. After hearing this, a question arose: Who is the examiner? "If it is" Lu Xi's "place," I would like to ask Miss Lu Xi whether her technique is legal?</p>
<p>On the twelfth, a Western-dressed, dark-faced big reporter "Zhanda" (according to the newspapers, the big reporter Zhanda is the snake chief of the Hongguang Society) came to the Lidi Radio Station and distributed wedding invitations with the surname Zhu to the broadcasting ladies of a certain troupe. However, according to the ladies, "What Zhu surname? Who is the Zhu surname? We don't even know who this Western-dressed reporter is! We don't know if he is having a stroke or what...?" (Above Tonglei)</p>
<p>It is said that Miss Liying, the president of the Baijimen Society, used the name Liying when she was studying.</p>
<p>The members of the Qingxin Art Society have recently been completely changed.</p>

<p>After the Ying Society disbanded, the ladies have not yet received a penny of their salaries. (Above Mengying)</p>
<p>The little sister Yao Li of the Dingxiang Society has also made a male friend, and he is a foreign boy with green eyes and yellow hair. This boy can speak Chinese very well, but he is not very willing to speak.</p>

<p>Hu Die, after touring Europe and watching Soviet dramas, often told her colleagues at the Star Film Company that they should perform a drama on a large scale, because Soviet dramas are truly captivating. Just take the set design as an example, you can see flowers bloom and fall on the stage, the moon wax and wane, and a light boat drifting on the lake.</p>
<p>Encouraged by Hu Die, everyone became enthusiastic, and they seemed to have a good interest in performing dramas. Let's do it, so there was this performance of "The Moon is Round."</p>

Therefore, the great success of "Hero of the Times" can also be said to be greatly helped by Zhou Ke's photography. In fact, the film of "Hero of the Times" is too beautiful.</p>
