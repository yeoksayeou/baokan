<h3 id="c9">世界通貨政策之前途 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— 仁</p>
<p>今日世界經濟各方面之現象。殆皆為壁壘森嚴之對立。以及由此對立而引起之尖銳的鬥爭。以貨幣問題言。有英美等通貨膨脹政策之存在。同時亦有法瑞等通貨收縮政策之存在。前者紙幣之集團與後者黃金之集團顯係對立。而世界通貨政策之前途如何。亦將視此對立鬥爭之結果如何以為轉移。</p>
<p>目前世界經濟恐慌愈益深刻。生產過剩亦愈益顯著。各國為苟延其現存之經濟組織計。誠非減低其幣值以利輸出不可。故在此情狀之下。紙幣集團與黃金集團之鬥爭。前者自立於優勢之地位。如本年三月末。比利時正苦經濟狀態日趨惡化。及其舉國一致內閣成立。即宣告金本位之脫離頓使黃金集團感受日暮途窮之慨。即其最顯著之一例也。</p>
<p>比利時放棄金本位之方法。殆與美國前年放棄金木位之手段完全相同。即（一）金兌換停止。（二）法定平價減低。（三）平價減低後之益金。作為匯兌平衡資金。此種放棄金本位之方法。實可謂為晚　金本位停止之特徵。當歐戰時各國金本位之停止也。其手段皆僅為金兌換之停止與金輸出之禁止。至若平價之減低能當皆為金本位制回復時之手段。而今日則不然。金本位停止同時即實行平價之減低。其所以如此者。乃欲提出匯兌之平衡資金。蓋金本位停止之結果。匯兌市價即趨於低落。欲防止匯價低落後不安全之動搖。即不能不有賴於匯兌平衡資金而平價減低與金本位停止之同時並進。即所以使從來保有之黃金。在名義上加多。然後以此名義上加多之金保有作為唯一之匯兌平衡資金之來源。此種依平價減低而取得平衡資金要亦為今日世界通貨政策之一特徵也。</p>
<p>本年以來。世界集團之命運。已願呈分崩離析之狀。荷蘭政府為遏止黃金之外流已實施事實上之匯兌管理。瑞士政府亦有實行減低貨幣成色之議。意大利政府曾於五月間嚴令私人保有之外國證券交於銀行。列入外匯局賬中。實行緊密之外匯管理。本月二十二日又發表命令。解除意大利國家銀行對於所發紙幣必須有現金準備百分之四十之責任。實際上蓋已放棄其金本位矣。此種山雨欲來風滿樓之狀態。實足證明金集團之基礎。已在飄搖顛簸之中。至若素稱金集團盟主之法國。以年來之經濟狀態論。則匯價高勝物價低落。失業大增，財政短絀。事實上實早應放棄金本位以求超脫。其所以猶欲保守金本位者。其大部分原因。則由於法國一九二八年減低平價五分之一時。曾昭示全國。將不再使國民蒙不利。故年來雖經濟狀態日惡。政府猶不能不以巨大之犧牲。以維持金本位也。</p>
<p>現法國金融情形。表面上雖因賴伐爾內閣全權法案之通過。而呈稍安之象、實則黃金滾滾外流。仍無已時。法政府將此種黃金外流現象。全諉罪於投機之結果。無如事實上所昭示者。顯為法國金本位根本上必然之結果。</p>
<p>山　　論可知今日紙幣集團與黃金集團之鬥爭。實已至於短兵相接之時。　　此鬥爭之過釋中金集團頗有失敗之危險假使將來金集團果由失敗遭遇至於　　。　　集團之對立。自將消減，世界通貨政策中金紙之對立亦將消減。申言之。即今日金集團之諸國。將一齊加入於紙幣本位國之集團中。取同一之步調。而世界通貨政策之前途。將因此而發生一新的轉變矣。</p>

<p>（倫敦）今日海軍部口頭聲稱、昨日每日通報所報英海軍七年造艦計畫之說、完全出於猜測、海軍部决定置諾不理云、今晨各早報載稱、造艦新程序刻在籌議中、但尚未有最後之决定、晨郵報稱、英國現已遭遇必需同時建造十一艘新主力艦之局面云、彙聞報謂政府內部意見、頗爲紛紜、而海軍部對於增加海軍效能之最善方法、亦復主張不一、有主張逐漸廢除舊艦者、亦有主張迅速建造德國式之袖珍戰艦者云（三十日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）英國自一九三六年至一九四二年之七年間、投以一萬萬五千萬鎊之巨欵、樹立大造艦計劃、已誌前報、茲據日本海軍當局之非正式推算、其情形如左、</p>
<p>主力艦　一四艘　四九萬噸</p>
<p>航空母艦　一〇艘　二二噸</p>
<p>巡洋艦　七二艘　五五噸</p>
<p>驅逐艦　一四二艘　二〇噸</p>
<p>潛水艦　五七艘　七噸</p>
<p>以上合計　二九五艘　一五三噸</p>
<p>如完成上項計劃時、則英國保有之勢力、總計推定爲一百五十二萬噸、比較現有勢力之一百一十九萬三千五百噸、約可增加三十四萬噸、卽增至二成八分有奇、惟上項推算、係作爲代換老艦建設新艦後、將該老艦概行廢除之推算、倘不廢除、則其全部保有之勢力將近二百萬噸、抹煞軍縮精神、而明目張膽實行軍擴、是以日本海軍對於此案、以爲軍縮會議迫近之際、而樹立此項龐大計畫、誠不得不爲世界和平憂、如其造艦宣言之內容亦復若是、則與其追逐於此、反不如由國防見地上觀察、實行自主之軍備、則於財政上效果豈啻天壤之別、故世上抱有此項見解者頗非少數云、（三十日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）據聞英國政府預想華盛頓及倫敦兩海軍條約將滿期失効、對日美法意等各海軍國發出通告、表示自一九三五年至一九四二年爲止、投經費一億五千萬金磅、淸算老朽軍艦、建設新銳海軍、日本政府現尚未接其通告、然如此消息係事實、英國確有企圖釀成實現建艦宣言以代比率主義之機運、而使軍縮會議前途更爲昏頓、據日海軍意見、英國所企圖之建艦宣言案、係似日本提案而非者也、日本主張之共同最大限制度、規定各國所必要軍備之最少限度、而各國在其範圍內建造軍艦、故毫無宣言之必要、尤其以一九四二年保有量爲某準之建艦案、不外於此率主義之延長、吾人不得不反對之、（三十日日聯社電）</p>

<p>閩省體育之橷猷及南遊歸來之感想　吳蕰瑞　吳澂　程登科</p>
<p>福建省敎育廳廳長鄭心南、當代有名科學家也、自主持閩省敎育以來、政績卓著、鄭氏抱科學救國之宏願、故數年來費五六萬金、創設一極完善之科學館於省會中心、使省會公私立原校、就近應用、不必自備科學儀器、其所收效力省經費、不言可知、其中凡上課敎室、學生實騐室、及專門研究室等、無不應有盡有、近且由省會中之科學設備、而推及全省切實規定上年度為科學年、補充各校經費設置科學儀器、一年以來、已具鶵形、鄭廳長又見閩省人士之文弱、國民體育之重要、科學設備之外、應擴充體育設備、樹推進學校體育之基礎、故又毅然定二十四年度為體育年、聘中央大學體育科講師吳德懋為省政府參議兼體育督學、會同第三科長唐翼冲辦中小學暑期講習會、內設體育組、令中小學敎員及社會敎育機關、派員聽講、邀請該省體育家方萬邦回閩講學、方因不能全期駐閩、再邀同人等為之相助、此為同人等閩遊之由來、</p>
<p>體育組到有男女學員九十六人、所有目科、頗為切實鄭廳長乘同人等在閩之便、復召集全省中等學校校長、開體育討論會、為謀全省體育之推進、而集全省公私立學校校長于一堂、開專門會議、此實為體育同人與中學校長携手之創舉、在此次會議席上、規定以全校經費百分之一至百分之三、為體育經費、學生所繳納之運動費、須保持獨立、不得移用、由校長呈准敎廳、再行動用、在本體育年度中、各校務必將最低體育設備置備就緒、得由體育督學視察考成、加以褒貶、鄭廳長並深知要推行體育、當以敎育人才為先題、故决於二十四年度起、在福州師範開設體育師範班、以為幹部人才之造就、作推進全省體育之張本、省立師範之設有體育科者、除河北省外、未之前聞也、以上種種、俱為此次會議良好之收獲、</p>

<p>（一）體育界從此大團結閩省體育指導員林蔭南、體育界之老前輩也、福建體育之得有今日、林君一手之功、今知體育年內任務之重要、决非少數人之力量所能為、特以領袖地位、倡體育界大同盟、消除個人私見學系派別之爭、共謀全閩體育之推進、而達復興民族之天職、其見地之正切、為同人所欽佩、今而後、閩省體育進展、皆林君登高一呼喚醒迷夢之功也、</p>
<p>（二）學員之專心研究在閩省數週、適値酷暑、而各學員每天上午有五小時之學科、下午二三小時之術科、有時夜間並開討論會、而各學員好學不倦、見疑即問、此秤好學之心、實可欽佩、同人等自愧學淺、而處此情境、是不能不勉為其難、　途追憶、猶有餘樂也、（未完）</p>

<p>— 吳雅非</p>
<p>椿先生是一位清朝的舉人，他在不久以前還曾給一般人擁戴過的，可是他現在除了息影林泉，以岐黃問世之外，對於任何時事都不加顧問，他彷彿要從此遁跡世外，悠然地消磨其晚景了。</p>
<p>他近來有些厭惡這世界，原因是因為這世界給他的印象太壞了；所以對於現在的任何事物都感到有些悲哀。然而最使他生氣的，應該是他的兒子和女兒的行為，太不成個樣子。</p>
<p>「嗨！我自己太糊塗，悔不該去給他們進什麽勞什子的洋學堂；現在讓他們變成了個另不成男，女不成女，還像個什麽樣兒！年輕輕的大姑娘可以整天到外面去軋男朋友，小夥子家一天到晚不想做事，只挾了女人上電影院跳舞場去講戀愛；出醜，唉！這世界……」他想到這里，簡直火冒了起來：「父親不能管束兒女，那真豈有此理」！</p>
<p>的確，椿先生是世代書香的後裔，怎能去同一般沒門檻的人家比呢？如今他的兒子女兒竟敢不服他的家教，而偏瘋狂般的在外面去交際，這不是故意和他搗蛋嗎？那真是把他幾根黃鬍子也根根氣得反豎起來。</p>
<p>「啊！反了，反了，世界給弄到了這般地步，男女不分，還成話嗎？並且連了老子也管束不了兒女了。什麽見了父親叫也不叫一聲，一見面就要錢，不給就嚷家庭革命；好，從明天起，就不准他們進門，登報脫離骨肉關係」。他在書房里團團轉的打着圈子，自言自語的咕嘟着，說到登報脫離骨肉關係的時候，用拳頭擊着桌子，彷彿增加了他不少勇氣。</p>
<p>覺得有些疲了，便在窗口一隻靠椅上坐了下來，提起一把小花茶壺，喝了一口參　湯，好像頓把胸口頭的一股氣平了下去。</p>
<p>他剛才嘴里雖然說了要登報脫離骨肉關係，然而此刻平心靜氣的一想，却又不對，這不但要使親戚朋友笑話；況且我秦家也只有那一綫根苗，「不孝有三無後為大」，不行，還是再好好的教導他們吧！他這樣一想，一切怒氣都消了</p>

<p>世界上祇有英格蘭的人是最富于保守性的話，那末及木先生就是十足地英格蘭人的典型，他是一位公子哥兒，但是他却和別的公子哥兒不同，他已經是快到六十歲的老公子了，他的不同的地方是：普通的公子哥兒，大都喜新厭舊，好高鶩遠，他却不然；他不厭故，尤其不喜新，更怕人談到高遠的問題；他對於一切新的事，物，都懷疑，詛咒，非難，譏詐，除非新鑄的銀幣，新印的鈔票，他沒法兒不用，他住的房子，是在一個很古舊的弄堂裏，房子的保險期，在十幾年前，就已經超過了他因要保存元氣，不但終年不洗澡，連局部的脚，都難得洗一兩回，他指甲長了不肯剪，他的牙齒鬆了，甚至馬上要落下來了，他不肯請牙醫生替他拔掉，說是要保全父母遺體，他吃福建金獅牌皮絲烟，三十年沒有換過牌子，他同時也吸老美女雪茄烟也是三十年如一日，他的臥室角落裏堆積雪茄烟的空盒，頂到天花板，從不肯把它棄去。他的桌上，有十五年前的破申報紙做墊子，他每天午飯吃一碗，晚飯吃兩碗。儘管沒有飽，或者吃不下，從來不肯增減一口。他櫥上有二十九年前的僧帽牌香烟盒，有四十幾年前的舊緞帽，有十幾年前的竹耳挖，有……年前的……總之走進他的屋子，就好像進了古物陳列所。</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>這種富于仁愛心的作為，雖說是在我們中國的歷史上已數見不鮮，而歷代的君主中，更不乏這樣愛民如子的人物；可是不論伊老人家此舉還是自創的主見，還是有心要效法古人，總可算是很夠人欽佩的。</p>
<p>我因為曾經知道有這么一件事情，所以很相信伊也是一位富于仁愛性的老太太，伊一定會眷念着那個叛臣過去的功績，以及他的家庭，決不能很乾脆地決定他應受的處罰。</p>
<p>論到處罰，最嚴重不過的自然是殺頭或絞決了！其次就是由朝廷下一張詔書給他，教他自己服藥自盡，或自刎，自縊。依着現在這一個廣東巡撫的罪狀而論，殺頭和絞決當然是太兇了；比較相稱的，就要算賜令自裁了。可是太后心上還覺不忍，那麼就隨便讓他過去了嗎？不；不，太后雖富于仁愛心，却也不肯故意偏護他，失却公正的意義；於是下面的一條上論，便在第二天上經軍機處發表了。不消幾日，全中國都知道了這件事情。</p>
<p>「奉上諭：廣東巡撫××貪贓枉法，聲名狼藉，前派戶部尚書××，刑法侍郎××等前往查辦，據覆奏勘查屬實，應即革職，發往黑龍江永不敘用；其家產並着江蘇省（因為那犯案的巡撫的老家是在蘇州）巡撫××飭由地方官查封籍沒，欽此。」</p>
<p>這個處罰看起來似乎還是很輕的，而且這種種都是在三十多年以前所發生的，但它的影響所及，却一直到現在還不曾消減。（三七八）</p>

<p>所以在表面上，張介夫再不幫忙呢，他不負責任。好在自己在這裏，還有一夜勾留，也許再去敷衍敷衍他，可以得着他一點好處。浣花出着神，呆了一陣。偶然回過頭來，却看到程志前隔了玻璃窗子，向他微笑。便點頭道：程先生今天沒有出門去。志前隨便的答應着沒有出門去。這句話說完，心裏可就想着，人家心理正在難受，何必這樣冷冷的對着人家。便點頭笑道：恭喜你，現在可以回江南了。他答道：嗐！這那裏談得上恭喜。這好比一個坐牢的人，快要出牢門。可是出了牢門以後，究竟怎麼樣，一點也不知道，也許不過三天，我就活餓死了。他口裏說着，人向屋子走了來。志前和他相了許久，人家既走了進來，沒有將人家推了出去的道理，便笑道：請坐罷。由　裏分別了，再到南方去，就不知道是否能會面了。浣花倒不料志前能這樣表示好感，假使用好言語和他談談，也許他能夠助一臂之力，便笑道：你看，像甘肅逃難來的那位朱家姑娘，他會嫁了賈先生作姨太太，這不是人生悲歡離合，都很難說嗎？志前笑道：楊小姐的意思，以為那位朱姑娘，很是得意嗎？浣花　說，倒是頓了一頓，有一句　答復不出來，因為志前，已經斟了杯茶放到他面前，　就　起茶杯來喝了一口。（二七八）</p>

<h3 id="c159">世界最大的大胖子 <a href="#c159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>德國唯一的大胖子羅白德魯芹道夫，Robert　Ruggendorf　最近在羅斯堡地方亡故了。他的身體計重五百三十九磅，平日以公開展覽他的胖身材為生活。他出去旅行時，只能搭坐運貨的火車，因為客車的門太小，不能容他出入之故，所以他自己特備了一輛摩托車，可以容得下他那一座肉山的，以作遠行之用。他所住的屋子，前門特別放大，比他的鄰居的門，大到一倍以上，他那胖的程度，也就可想而知了。</p>
<p>然而魯芹道夫雖胖，還比不上英國人愛德華白拉德Hdward　Briaht在他死的時候，身重六百十六磅，身圍五英尺六英寸，胸圍六英尺十一英寸，他的臂膊的中段周圍　英尺六英寸。他並不供人展覽，以販賣雜貨為生，終於為了他的身體一天胖一天，在三十歲上就死了。他死了之後，馬爾屯地方有人賭東道，說是五個二十一的男子，可以包裹在他的半臂裏頭，那知結果竟可裹住十個人，那半臂還是挺挺的。白拉德身後遺有一妻與子女五人。他的生性很愉快，食量比了普通的人也並不這樣大，不過在他去世以前的數年中，每天要喝啤酒一加侖。在他死後，棺木不能扛出大門，只得打開了牆壁，方能扛將出去。</p>
<p>以上二人胖雖胖了，但是還有一個世界最大的大胖子，他的名兒喚做但尼兒藍白德Daniel　Lamber在他死前的幾天身重七百三十九磅，腰圍九英尺四英寸，他的一條腿周圍三十七英寸。他每製一件衣服，成衣匠索價二十金鎊之巨。他生在英國勒西斯德地方，力大如牛，六百磅的東西很容易地舉將起來。曾有一次，有一頭馬戲班中的大狗熊，在街上欺侮一頭狗，他大抱不平，和那狗熊扭打起來，終於打敗了它，把那狗放走了。藍白德在少年時代也是一個很有功夫的游泳家，他那胖大的身材，高高地浮在水面，他的背上可容二個壯男子站立着，好像站在木筏上一樣。</p>
<p>藍白德的父親並不是胖子，他的身材與普通不相上下，他是勒西斯德牢獄中的獄卒。到得他年老退休的時候，就由藍白德繼續担任獄卒的職務。他的心地恰像他的身體一般的大，所以對待囚犯們特別的寬大，從無虐待他們的事情。後來因服務勤勉，一步一步的升上去，竟升到了典獄官的地位，在他退休時，政府中還給與他一筆優厚的養老金。只為他生得太胖了，不論走到那裏去，往往有許多人圍着他瞧，所以他退休之後，無事可做，也就索性作公開的展覽了。他雖不依此為生，然而與其關閉在自己的家裏，那又無妨借他的胖身材出去掙錢呢？他住在辟開狄來，作為展覽的所在，他的氣派很大，甚麼都很講究，常有當時的重要人物前去看他，更使他的身價增高不少。一連幾年，他的展覽事業十分發達，爭下了很多的錢。後來在林肯歇埃的史丹福鎮中去世，但他至今還是保持着世界大胖的最高紀錄。</p>
<p>白拉德以三十歲死，藍白德以四十歲死，而最近的魯芹道夫以四十七歲死，可見身體的發胖，實在也是一種病症，凡是大胖子往往不能享高年的。</p>

<h3 id="c174">「盛世危言」 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>淸朝末年，浙江山陰人湯壽潛曾經刊過盛世危言這樣一部書。我讀那書時，年紀還很輕，現在想來，印象很糢糊。前年，看見一本由廣州寄來的盛世危言一類的東西；其中擔心亡國滅種的大禍就要到來，叫國人早日警惕，早日奮發。一番有心人的話頭。國人裏面，這般擔驚害怕人未始沒有，如黃遵憲（公度）就在甲午戰役以後寫過這樣的詩：</p>
<p>『一自珠崖棄，紛紛各效尤。瓜分惟客聽，薪盡向予求。</p>
<p>秦楚縱橫日，幽燕十六州。未聞南北海，處處扼咽喉！</p>
<p>弱肉供强食，人人虎口危；無邊畫甌脫，有地盡華離。</p>
<p>爭聞三分鼎，橫張十字旗。波蘭與天竺，後患更誰知？』</p>
<p>時間過了幾十年，滅種的大痛固不曾嘗到過；亡國在預料中，也不一定有什麽大苦難，一般人還是可以熙熙攘攘過快樂的日子的。「盛世危言」一種的說法，有人也就以為如「彗星尾巴掃到地球，地球將要毁滅」那樣預言，當作海外奇談那樣「姑妄聽之」就够了。</p>
<p>西漢文帝時，有一位得文帝寵愛的書生—賈誼，他有所陳對，文帝還前席以聽，但是賈生陳情對策，總是痛哭流涕長太息。以文帝那樣聖明之君，而賈生痛哭流涕長太息以言，才是道盛地的世危言。賈生自己彷彿十分不得志似的，過汨羅為弔屈原，後來哀傷短命以終，若以比之另一位痛哭流涕長太息的書生—　錯，因為帮皇帝去翦除宗室，惹起七國連兵的大禍，自己做了淸君側那口號的犧牲品，賈生的危言可說幸運多了。惟盛世方可以危言，有文帝那樣聖明之君，賈生的痛哭流涕長太息才不至觸忌諱；明哲所以保身，聖人給我們說了一個聰明的辦法。東漢末年，黨錮之禁，先後二十餘年，士大夫被殺戮囚禁的以千百計。後來中常侍呂彊吿訴漢靈帝，說：『黨錮久積，人情多怨，若久不赦宥，輕與張角合謀，為變滋大，悔之無及。』靈帝怕了起來，才解除黨禁。不久黃巾亂起，東漢也就終結了。那時候有一位書生—仲長統，每回談論時俗，必發憤嘆息。他所著的那部昌言，斥責「君臣宣淫，上下同惡」的政局，攻擊「連棟數百，膏田滿野」的豪族，言下已斷定漢運之將終。這也是賈生痛哭流涕長太息式的危言，其遭時忌，自在意中；可是他自己的態度却非常消極，祗要過『居有良田廣宅，背山臨流，溝池環匝，竹木周布，塲圃築前，果園樹後，舟車足以代步涉之難，使命足以息四體之役，養親有兼珍之膳，妻孥無苦身之勞；良朋蒞止，則陳酒肴以娛之，嘉時吉日，則烹羔豚以奉之。』的退隱生活，就够滿意，所以雖昌言一番，還沒有什麽大罣礙的。</p>
<p>寫到這里，我又想起另一種盛世危言來。明淸之交，東南大儒黃宗羲寫過一本明夷待訪錄，現存的祗有薄薄的一本。依我們推測，原書至少要比現存的要多四五倍；這些不見了的，都是經過淸初那些聖明之主，康熙，雍正乾降刪削掉的；稽古右文的十全皇帝，給明夷待訪錄來一套凌遲大刑。黃宗羲的意下，以為箕子陳洪範，武王洗耳恭聽；他的待訪錄總有一天可見天日，那料後世的武王，却要叫孔子删詩書，把洪範篇割裂得不成樣兒的。所以危言祗能說得空泛一點，要說得切實如明夷待訪錄那樣，祗好照太史公所說藏之名山傳之其人的辦法了。</p>
<p>有人說：韓非子的亡徵，不是更切實的盛世危言嗎？韓非子列舉四十七種可亡的徵象，（亡徵者，非曰必亡，言其可亡也。）其中有最切要的幾種說：『羣臣為學，門子好辯，商賈外積，小民內困者可亡也。用時日，事鬼神，信卜筮而好祭祀者可亡也。喜淫刑而不周於法，好辯說而不求其用，濫於文麗而不顧其功者可亡也。恃交援而簡近鄰，怙强大之救而侮所迫之國者可亡也。好以智矯法，時以私雜公，法禁變易，號令數下者可亡也。出軍命將太重，邊地任守太尊，專制擅命，徑為而無所請者可亡也。見大利而不趨，聞禍端而不備，淺薄於爭守之事，而務以仁義自飾者可亡也。』後來韓國果以此亡了國，其他楚齊燕趙也以此亡了國，韓非子的言，皆不幸而言中。屈原自沉汨羅以前，還可寫一篇長的九篇短的痛快發牢騷的文章，而韓非子所列舉四十七種亡徵，可以全部保存到如今。假若生當稽古右文的十全皇帝時代，韓非子能免於明夷待訪錄的遭遇嗎？</p>
<p>以上說的都是古老的故實。</p>
<h3 id="c175">科學不是馴良的小孩 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>科學的進步，日見其速。從原始人到希西沃特，Hesiod希臘詩人，約五萬或五萬年以上。從希西沃特到達文齊Leonardo　da　Vinci約二千五百年。從達文齊到佛蘭克林Franklin為三百五十年。從佛蘭克林到今日，為一百五十年。每一時代的成績，總比前一時代豐富得多。</p>
<p>人類本身，今很幼稚，但是科學還在牠的襁褓中哩。我們的智識，好比一個球，隨時所學知的一切，都築在球的面上，我們所不知道的，是球外的空間，—無涯。</p>
<p>三十年前的科學，在今日已屬陳腐了。舊日的科學圖書庫，簡直是一大堆死的事實，塵垢滿封，無人問津，但是這種漠視往往覺得太過分了些。</p>
<p>科學家是人類中最高尙的種，他們不但覺求實現，　　還能使人類的前途增加些光明。</p>
<p>人類今日的奮鬥，是一個征服的戰爭，我們必須努力制勝大自然的力量，而利用牠們。但是知己知彼，才能百戰百勝。所以我們欲求取勝，必須先知道牠們，倘若不知敵人何在，從何處下手進攻呢？</p>
<p>科學的最大工具，便是人的腦子。智力比望遠鏡顯微鏡電流計更重要，更有力。創造的精神發揚不休，所以科學進步的希望，幾無窮盡。</p>
<p>科學不受時間的限制，不屬於任何一國，不屬於任何一洲，不屬於任何一世紀，甚至不屬於這世界，也不屬於太陽系，却是屬於宇宙的。</p>
<p>我們或以為科學家和普通人類的行逕不同，這是一種謬想。科學家也是一個人，往往是很平常的人，不過他們的工作，超過其他人類的努力。假使你要藐視科學，必須愼防自己，因為牠的背後，隱藏着永久　　　，無限的力量，和造化。</p>
<p>美術的工作，無論令人如何欽仰，但不過是一種理想的反映。科學却以現實的斷片貢獻我們。換句話說，美術是人類的，科學是超人類的。</p>
<p>科學家有發明家，批評家，和學者種種的分別。這些人各有特性，一位眞正科學家，能將這許多特性融化於一爐，但很少集合在一個人身上。科學家專心研究，有時偏重一種性質，也有時太缺乏別種性質。</p>
<p>發明是從堅忍得來的，著名科學家無一不有偉大的榮耀的固執性。</p>
<p>自信力是科學家最需要的。當他進化驗室時，必須具着信念，和耶教徒受難殉身的那種熱忱。</p>
<p>世界上有幾種大　明，並非成於科學家之手。如英國醫學家靳勒（Jonner）發明種牛痘法，法國醫學家拉內萊克，Lanenec）發明診斷學之類。又如法國的外交家雷　（F　de　Leseps）本非工程師，但他成功的事業，勝過數百精幹工程師的工作。（按雷氏為蘇彝士運河的計畫者）。</p>
<p>理想的科學家，除去他的科學研究之外，絕無其他奢望，不關心權利的得失。他在化騐室中，消磨他的寶貴光陰，左右只圍着專心學習的學生三四人，每天由化騐室出來時心裏總瑩繞着種有創造性的好夢，在他的面前，永遠射着像燦爛明星似的光芒，引道他到一種或大或小新發明的事物上。</p>
<p>現在各國已建有許多完備的化騐所，燃着明亮的電燈，設備了精緻奇異的儀器。但是拉伏西爾，（Lavoisier法國化學家，改良火藥的製法，發見空氣的成分，關明酸素的性質。）巴斯特，（Pateur）法國化學家，及顯徵鏡學者，發明　　之理，研究恐水病種痘治療法。）居理，（Jurie法國化學家，發日銑　。）及　他許多工作者，都在都們貧陋小屋中成　他們偉大的發明。</p>
<p>科學不是一個　良　和有禮貌的小孩子，只要　些　慰　　愛，便够了。牠是　　的，冷嚴的，不受憐憫的，往往為了一點極微細的愛好，不惜作年歲月悠久的大犧牲。</p>
<p>極大的發明，可用一句短語包括凈盡的。拉伏西爾說：「生命是化學的現象。」巴斯特斷定萬病都是寄生物為患」。化學物理醫學三種，不過是這兩種主題的發展罷了。</p>
<p>盲欵和盲信，同出一源。無任何證據而輕信，和不相信任何證據，是同樣的愚妄。</p>
<p>一位眞正科學家，必定敢革命的。他對於公認最尊嚴的學理，也必抱着懷疑的態度，他必討論一切，他必密切研究一切，科學思想，出於好奇，醫學思，在求安全。但是醫學家的安全，必須以科學家的好奇為根本。</p>
<p>科學中有曰種學術系統，一切都是精細的，並且是極端精細。但是歷史的和描寫的科學，牠們　範圍。比實騐　科學，狹窄多了。化學和物理學，現在已超勝　切。物理學能使我們透視各物的性質。</p>
<p>這一　科學史，就是　科史。這些錯誤，有的很大，有時極可　。但就整個而論，前者之失，後者之師，他們的錯誤，也有益於人的。</p>
<p>自拉伏西爾之後，生命可用科學力產生的種種明證，不再有何疑義。但這一切生活的燃燒，並不是生命唯一的旨趣。　謂造化忍耐地造成無量數的生物，使之有各各不同的形體，精巧複雜的機關，專為了多產生些熱力，水，和炭酸，那是誰也不能相信的。故生活世界的化學力，必須成一種工具，却不是一種結果。</p>
<p>勤苦工作，不足成功一個大發明，即小發明，也不會因此而成的。許多勇士，曾經過科學家勤苦的生活，但是他們成就些什麽呢？他們把機會和智慧都辜負了。</p>
<p>科學的歷史，證明除去算學以外，一切進步，都不能專靠着由圖書館或研究所感發生的學理而得到的。必須時常觀察，時常實騐，才能得到進步。</p>
<p>種實騐，無論計　如何拙劣，實施如何　笨，總比一種光明的學現，更有價値。</p>
<p>未來的發明，是無窮盡的，萬物　隱　中，都埋着無量的寳　　。</p>

<p>『於是我走向她家去，果然不出我所料想，我在姨母屋裏一間側房裏遇見她，她的家政就在那兒。她站在房子中間，面孔蒼白，牙齒咬着嘴辱，咬得血流到　下。所有抽履和箱筴，全給她打開了；花邊和布片撒滿地周圍地上。「娜麗！」我喊，「你幹甚麽，娜麗？」但她好似沒有聽見我說話。—「星期日跳舞館有人跳舞麽？」她問。「跳舞館？—那同你有甚相干！」—「我要跳舞去！」—「你？你的寳貝知道了要說甚麽話呢？」—「我的寶貝同我有甚麼相干！」—此時她已經戴起了帽子幷從衣櫥裏把圍巾取出來，然後她打開一個小箱子，她平素積蓄的錢就放在這小箱子裏面；—她平素雖然喜歡化錢在裝飾上面，但總歸積蓄了幾個錢為的將來不至於光着身子到新郞家裏去。現在她扯開紙包，把錢裝到衣袋裏去。「你同我去，好麼？」她問，但她堅邀我去，我便跟隨她去，因為我還希望打消她的跳舞念頭。但我的話都是白費了的，因為她急忙忙地同我在街上走着，旣不聽我一句，又不看我一眼。</p>
<p>「當我們走進市塲站在布店櫃檯前面時候，她便呌店夥拿出最好看的綢緞和最時髦的錦紗來看，這些她平時在本城最高貴人家裏才看得見的。她在這些中間找來找去，幷弄得亂七八糟糟一大堆。店夥還拿出來一件貨品。「買花料的太太如果出得起價錢的話……！」他說，幷把手放在這透明的衣料底下。「不相干，」娜麗說，「她是出得起價錢的」。—我暗中觸了她一下，因為我現在明白了她是要買這貴重的衣料給自己用的。「娜麗」，我輕輕說，「我請你回想一下吧，你要這貴重的東西做甚麼？」—但她毫不留意，她呌店夥把衣料剪下來，把亮晶晶的錢數在櫃檯上，她彷彿沒有想到她流了多少時候的苦汗才能賺得這些錢。「不要管我，」她說，當我總拉着她手臂時候，「我總要穿一次好衣裳，我幷不比這裏最美的人兒醜些啊！」</p>

<p>先是眼睛裏併出了無數的火花，這無數的火花，凝成了他那媽媽的蒼白的臉龐。斑白的蓬鬆的髮絲，無力地飄搖着；深陷的眼巢裏，稀少的睫毛上，堆着孤苦淚，簌簌地滴落下來，把瘦的臉，全都潤濕了。</p>
<p>幕地，低垂的帳頂，化作了一座龐大的西式的建築，繼而又昏昏然的，一切的輪廓都麻糊地放大起來，他的軀殼又似乎被運到了一座新建的精緻洋房裏面，一個帶着黑色玳瑁邊眼鏡的中年人，不斷地對他說：</p>

<p>壁上的時鐘，淸晰地，也似乎特別警吿他似的，有力地敲着四下了！夏夜是短促的，向東的玻璃窗，己透上曙光，斷脚的凳子，堆得凌亂的檯子，碎了燈泡的煤油燈與瓶罐，都顯現出它們矇瞳的綫條來了這樣一來，又使諒夫起了一陣强烈的煩燥；尤其他在檐心着痔的復發後，起了痙擊似地一陣發悸；終於就使他企圖利用極下作的方法來催眠一下。</p>

<p>「做什麽？諒夫，你別嚇死人！」活潑的康雨首先那們問他。</p>
<p>諒夫自已這時候也醒了，知道是慣例的夢懨，但非常不好意思接見康雨的問話，反閉息地不敢動一動，祗做沒有這回事似的。一直到康雨的鼾聲復作，才大模大樣地翻了一個身。仍不多一歇，來了一陣凌亂的脚步聲，這使他不能再安眠了。諒夫就不留戀地抱着酸軟而瘦備的腿，扛着頗有重量而發脹的頭，鑽出床來。</p>

<p>— 宸</p>
<p>滬市商界領袖王一亭氏頃語新聲社記者，謂我國今日經濟衰頹狀况，危殆已至於極，一國之立國，以民為本，民本動搖，國又何以立。因以商人資格，鑑國內存銀缺乏，列强操縱金融手叚，日趨精密，我國處境困難，亟宜改革，乃條呈當局，早定具體辦法，以資應付，而固民本。</p>
<p>我國自古就有一句名言：「國以民立，民以國存」，這句話假若是用「現代化」來解釋，就是國家的存在，在於保民裕民，而人民的幸福，卽在能有一個强盛獨立的國家。其實這二者是二而一的東西，國家的强在於有無富裕的人民，而人民的富裕卽可决定國家强盛；不然，這一國家便包含着內部的矛盾。</p>
<p>因為我國的情形，最近已是由工業衰退，農村破產而日益發展到金融危機財政危機了。特別是美國白銀政策實施後，中國白銀流出，已經極度的動搖了中國的貨幣單位。列强在這時候便表現着各種「帮助」中國的「好意」，主張中國應當同美元英磅黃金等發生聯繫，當然，假若還想固固「民本」，這些盛意我們是難以領受的。</p>
<p>不過，要中國幣値穩固，不發生財政金融危機，先得平衡國際收支，要平衡國際收支，便須遏止外貨的大景輸入，與我國工農業的復興。因之，我們奉勸努力於「固民本」的諸君，問頭是如何去創造達到這一目的先决條伴，否則民本」便無從固起。立國就大成問題。</p>

<p>「飄吧！飄到天涯海角……飄到……」</p>
<p>徐徐把目光望到山頭，快樂得驚顫</p>
<p>「看，那輪在向上升的月亮，那金盤，那……」</p>
<p>好像一顆伸手可摘的金果，忘却了這是人間。週遭幽沉，靜穆，美謐。嶺南的輕鬆透骨的凉風，不休的吹着四面皆通的灰白色的凉亭，亭裏好幾個靑年人，倒在水門汀上，靠着亭柱，不是失神，是沉在塵外的境界裏，忽然，有誰個慢慢的，委婉的說：</p>

<p>拿把傘，穿着薄薄的短衫袴，背個小包袱，嘻哈豪壯的上凉亭，等月出待開行。然而，夜凉月色好，山間美醉留人戀，慢慢又慢慢，遲遲不行。</p>

<p>— 月山</p>
<p>有人把北平叫做「文化城」，其實近代文化的物質基礎，北平的好像不如上海的來得穩靠。就拿幾個名氣大一點的書局來說吧：商務，中華，總廠都在上海；等而下之，關明，現代，等書局，在北平的祇是支店而已，發行上，印刷上，各書局好像都以爲上海較北平爲便利，實際上上海也是來得比北平便利；那麼文化城一名，好像應交給上海才對，爲什麼北平反倒是文化城呢？</p>
<p>細想起來，北平旣不是商業城，政治城，或工業城，而照人口說又是全國第二大城；這樣坐第二把交椅的大城，不給牠一個漂亮一點的名字，像是總不合適的。於是在比較上說，北平還是文化城的；反正北平教授學生夠多，詩人文人也夠多，名爲文化城也不致於太過分，太名不符實的。我想，這就是「文化城」的來源吧。</p>
<p>我們且看文化城裏的文化街。</p>
<p>且不要誤會，說是北平真有這樣的一條街叫做文化街；沒有。文化街就是琉璃廠，俗名叫廠甸。琉璃廠其實也並沒有真的製琉璃的廠，祇是那麼叫；這就像松樹街不一定有松樹，羊肉胡同不一定便有羊肉什麼的，一樣；祇是那麼叫。至於爲什麼，就是更老的老北平也是弄不清楚的，不用說我。</p>
<p>至於琉璃廠爲什麼叫文化街，這個我却知道。原因是：書店多，紙筆店多，賣畫賣帖的店多，賣古玩古物的店也多。我且說句趣語：文化街裏的「文化店」（這麼叫吧。）的招牌，個個都寫得夠神氣，絕沒有難看的，醜的，由這一點也可看出文化街的一點風味來。</p>
<p>說得更實際些，文化街不應祇是琉璃廠，琉璃廠東口外的楊梅竹斜街也應叫文化街的，世界，開明等書局就在那斜街上，其他古玩紙筆店，也不在少數；不過比起琉璃廠來，好像總是遜一籌的。文化街與斜街都東西向的，中間隔着一條名子來得有趣的街：一尺大街，一尺大街並不長也不大，祇是略形彎曲，生生把文化街與斜街分開；要不然斜街是滿可以名爲琉璃廠而同享文化街之名的。</p>
<p>無論怎麼說吧，琉璃至楊梅竹斜街這一帶總是有些文化色彩的。這一帶的「文化店」大部分還是賣舊書的多，其次就得說是字畫店（裱糊拓帖等店屬此類），最少的是寥寥可數的幾家賣新書的店。於此也可見文化街的大概的。北平究竟是多少年的文人出沒地，舊書舊帖這類東西，自然要來得多些的。陽曆年和陰曆年的正月頭半月，是廠甸開放的時期，所謂開放，也不過是臨時加個市塲，凑凑熱閙而已。開放期中，由和平門過師範大學以至南新華街南端，足有二里長的一條街，滿是賣舊書舊帖的攤子，文人者流連其間者，自然不在少數；這總可見舊書在北平的勢力了。</p>
<p>新書業中，祇有商務印書館的門面來得漂亮，有樓；這是文化街裏的唯一的一座樓，想來和上海高樓櫛毘的文化街一定是兩樣的。文化街就正像文化城，古老，簡陋；舊書舊帖把文化街支撐起來，新書籍的勢力，在文化街是並不大的。至於新雜誌等書，銷售地已不是文化街了，東安市塲和西單市塲是牠門的本營，買雜誌而上文化街，多半是會失望的。</p>
<h3 id="c182">荷 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 胡思衷</p>
<p>多時未見荷花了，這次回家後看見庭院裏一缸荷花，正含雹待放，心中異常歡悅。古人說「荷是花之君子」，這說法並不是使我歡愛茶花的緣故，因爲我既不是所謂上流的君子人，照物以類聚，性有偏嗜的原則，則我自然不會以君子人的資格，來鑒賞比擬做君子的植物了。我愛牠，却毋寗說是環境的促成，和基於愛好自然的本性。幾年來困住在都市上海，滿眼是街道的烟塵，和蜂房似的的密密叢叢的屋宇，要想看一點清淡樸素的值物，實在是頗不容易的。更加被生活所壓制，要到像半淞園之類的中國式花園去玩賞一些青翠的值物，也沒有時間了。近來幸而有一個機會給我避到清靜的鄕下，在自己的家中看到清秀的植物，使精神與眼界一新，怎麼不會令人歡快呢？</p>
<p>此外，荷花這種值物確足令人愛。你看那圓圓的葉子，帶着青翠的秀色，支在娉婷而溫柔的枝梗上，隨風搖擺，確實可愛。便是那小小的嫩葉，披在水面上，或捲起了穉葉，用小小而柔弱的嫩枝，支成一支小傘般，蔭覆在大葉子的下面，有如嬌小而嫩弱的嬰孩一般可愛。花蕊從一點小小的含苞，一直長大，待到含苞待發，已經長成得有如艷光煥發的少女了。待將來花心怒放，綠瓣變成白色，在一缸的青蒼中，露出個個的白蕊來，實在足令人見了心悅。如果再展開了花心，把黃色的花絲像垂纓般倒覆，惹得一兩隻小蜜蜂在那兒翱翔，那更有趣了。</p>
<p>回家時正遇着多雨天，長日不出門，便靜靜地坐在庭院前，鑒賞那一缸秀色。在雨中，荷花是更覺可愛了。那葉子，被雨滴所打擊，略略一斜，雨珠便在光滑的葉面上傾溜，然後便被溜出來了，滴碎在地上，像真珠的進碎一樣。有時葉心的凹處滿貯着雨珠，傾瀉不出，便圓溜溜地在葉心上不住地滾盪，更覺好看。雨中的荷花更覺可愛，瓣子被雨水所染濕，越覺新鮮，對於人越有一種鮮明味。雨絲在水面上攪起縐紋，在一盆污泥上，水面却異常清澈，實在是助人清興不少。</p>
<p>對於荷，還能惹起一點溫馨的回憶的，是在十七歲的那年。那時學校放暑假，避居在鄉中。每日黃昏，我總同同學林姑娘，一齊散步於一個荷塘邊上。在晚風襲襲的當兒，嗅着風送來的陣陣花香，看遊魚在荷梗的隙縫間遊泳，更因池塘的廣大，荷花無數，使滿眼是潔白的花蕊，在倆人的心間鼓起純真的情感，我們每每步行到深夜，方才回去睡覺。如逢月夜，我們更樂得心跳。那時茶葉田田，葉面上的露珠，受着月光的映射，晶瑩瑩地很覺可愛。在滿眼是田園的清靜的鄉間，一池淺水，空氣間盪漾着香味，對於年青人的純真素樸的心情，和因此激發出來的溫馨的話語想見來，實是深堪回味的。及後東奔西走，純潔的友情是失去了，而秀美的荷花也很少看見。到現在，才能再在自己鄉的庭院，看到這小小的一缸，也是慰情聊勝於無了。並且對於失去的溫馨的回憶，使人對於友情和荷花，一同愛戀起來這可以說是我愛好荷花的緣故了。</p>
<h3 id="c183">紅蛋 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 敬嘉</p>
<p>妻子的肚子一天天地大起來了，朋友們見面時，總是這樣嚷着：</p>
<p>「恭喜，恭喜！幾時請我們吃紅蛋呢是？」</p>
<p>在面子上，我總是帶着微笑來敷衍他們的，可是在心裏，他們這種恭喜的聲音簡直就像一把專門刺心的鋼刀似的！</p>
<p>自己並不是一個不喜歡小孩子的人，往常看見親友鄰舍家的小孩子們時，總帶着一種歡樂的心腸的。無論心中有多煩的事，只要一看見小孩子，就會釋然了。自從結婚以後，我就希望着能早些有一個孩子，然而現在這希望已將實現了，而我的心中反像擱了一塊大石頭似的。有一種難堪的憂慮已隨着妻子的肚子的漸大在我的心中生長着了！</p>
<p>孩子的確是一個家庭中的天使，他可以供獻許多的快樂給家庭間。然而必須在相當的條件下才可以有這種天使的，沒有相當的條件，即使有了孩子，也不過是一種累贅而已。像我，決沒有資格做一個小天使的父親的。我的每月所入，不過是僅能維持夫妻倆最低的生活程度，再要添出人來，就難以過活了。在這種情形之下，我怎樣配有一個小天使呢！不過是累贅罷了！</p>
<p>妻也是個愛孩子的，當她發覺有孕時，曾開心得把淚都笑出來過的。她老在幻想着有了孩子後的一切。她說她要好好地做一個母親，把孩子變成一個頂天立地的漢子。自小就要使他有良好的習慣，身上要乾乾淨淨地，要不貪嘴，不胡閙，不浪費，不……將來給他進學校，使他有學問，好爲國出力，也可以替父母爭口氣過來……</p>
<p>爲了不忍打破妻的甜夢，我總是笑着附和着她的意見的。她說「要爲孩子買水手裝」，我答應着；她說要爲孩子買高尚的玩具，我答應着；她說「將來要把孩子送到好些的學校裏去，卽使學費貴點也不要緊」，我也答應着。我寗願讓我自己的心碎，我却不願意把她這一些幻想中的快樂也給消滅了。</p>
<p>然而畢竟妻的甜夢被她自己打破了。她發現我有時老縐着眉，就懇切地追問着我有什麼隱痛。起初我用不相干的話騙她，後來瞞不住了。我只得嘆了口氣道：</p>
<p>「我也想把孩子變個有爲的人物的，然而，有許多農人的子弟都具有超特的天才的，然而他們並沒成大人物，不過也是一個農人而已，窮人是沒辦法的！且不要談到以後吧，就是生了孩子時，朋友向我們要紅蛋，已經夠受的了！</p>
<p>於是妻也在心中生長着一種極難堪的隱痛了。她不再幻想，她也覺得孩子並不是我們這樣的家庭中所該有的了。</p>
<p>現在，妻已將臨盆了。每逢朋友向我們討紅蛋時，我們連裝上微笑的面具向他們敷衍的勇氣都沒有了。</p>
<p>紅蛋也得在相當的條件之下才能有的何！</p>

<p>蘭芝掌前別娘親。灃文禮數貌彬彬。俯身　跪鄧塵挨地。　　　。媳婦這。不能侍奉耍婦寗。婆婆聽。怒氣生。啟口聲聲罵賤人。快快與我滾回去。從今後。宛如拔去眼中釘。又把委香親女喚。將你嫂嫂的年庚取出莫留停。好呌她。琵琶別抱去嫁他人。兄妹聞言齊跪下。哀哀求告老慈親。可能夠。看着親生兒女面。饒她一次免生嗔。不料娘親心似鐵。將年庚擲向地中心。抽身直入房中去。哭壞了。季香蘭芝與仲卿。姑嫂而今要離別。蘭芝。臨去倍叮嚀。望妹妹。不忘初七和下九。更須要返娘家君自珍。雖然日後重迎接。但是我。家中有兄與慈親。未識可能哀憐我。實是心中愁萬分。只望。君心堅固如磐石。石邊蘆葦似儂心。夫妻立刻生離別。一陣心酸涕淚零。人間最苦在長亭</p>

<p>在藝華公司裏，發現了「牧童」「英雄」和「美人」。</p>
<p>牧童是「時勢英雄」導演應雲衛，原來那一天在烈日底下拍戲，應雲衛在導具間裏弄了一頂大得不可言狀的草帽放在頭上，這情形正如牛背上的牧童，然而裘逸葦指為「鐵公鷄」中之張嘉祥，因張嘉祥一語即引出一個英維來，便是尙冠武，乖乖這位先生的身材才高大，令人望之即會痴想楚霸王頂羽的氣概，一姜修說，尙冠武曾與徐琴芳合演過「霸王別姬」，「　狂呌，幾乎把虞姬的靈魂兒嚇掉，可見他足像一位英雄，應雲衛請其飾「時勢英雄」中之英雄，是眞上海人所云「配胃口」了。</p>
<p>然而尙有一美人在那裏？別急：你瞧紗窗移時，麝香熏人，半厲斜現，姿色驚人，斯何人耶？即英雄之對象，美人胡萍是也！胡萍在「時勢英雄」中飾美人，其魔力大焉，常聞娥眉微　，即英雄惶急，應雲衛此種手法，頗見功夫，待將來銀幕映出，必呌人心折之至了。</p>

<p>國產偵探鉅片「黑影」，為大長城影片公司圾偉大出品，不日將在金城大戲院公映。片為高占非，王元龍，胡萍，張美玉，尙冠武，袁叢美，張志直及徐華園諸大明星所合演。此外尙有陳大悲和吳文超等在片中扮演要角，故事係述一奸刁惡毒的靑年，以財迷心竅，疉犯血案，復因其所採用殺人方法，神出鬼沒，捉摸不定，大偵探為之束手無策。劇情曲折離奇，引人入勝，自始至終，使觀衆浸在恐怖迷惑的空氣中。近來影迷心理，對於偵探影片，似極感興趣，如最近在大光明開映的「一身是膽」，在賣座方面，已獲得最大之成功，故預料「黑影」之公映，定能轟動一時，蓋不但因其為偵探片，且如此衆多之明星，合演一片，亦為國產影壇以前從未有過之奇蹟云。</p>

<p>阮玲玉的「婦人心」公映後，我們又發現「奇蹟中之奇蹟」「黑影，」主演者為胡萍，高占非，王元龍，袁叢美；章志直，尙冠武，張美玉，徐莘園等。恐怕你生了眼睛，近沒有看過這樣好看的偵探片。</p>
<p>新華社聞已抵漢，江曼莉與妙音團顧紅均有新奇「演出」云</p>
<p>王獻齋是銀幕上的壞蛋，此次明星通訊中，他在「大家店」中難得做一次好人，但是昨日的銅板却請他做了「中人」，眞是抱歉之至。</p>

<p>— 篔</p>
<p>溯自一九三五年起。寳塔克汽車公司。蓋已加入低價類汽車業。而予汽車界人士以又一新貢獻。按此貢獻無他。蓋卽該公司新出六汽缸車是也。此項出品。與該公司改良盡善之直列八缸車。實相伯仲。舉凡該公司去年實施於八缸車之若干重要改革與進步。以及關於設計與搆造之一切特色。此取價較低之六缸車。殆莫不兼而有之。六缸車車身式樣。綜計有雙門及四門轎車。雙門篷轎車。轎跑車。運動轎跑車。以及兩用轎跑車等多種。</p>
<p>一九三玉年式寳塔克汽車。最顯著特色之一。厥為其工程師。獨能以臻於至善之瀉落式流綫型。實施於車之整個部份。而同時復能使其恰到好處。不稍涉離奇。致反有損於審美觀念是也。按此為寳塔克所獨有之特色。固已有目共賞。無待詞費。惟考此種新頴式樣。所以克底於成。則首應歸功於飛顯無風陣式通風堅實鋼「塔頂」車身之採用。緣此種搆造所具有之安全舒適與美觀程度。實已登峯造極。迥非以前任何飛顯車身所可同日而語也。其整輻堅實鋼車頂。支持於鋼托之上。與車身其餘鋼料部份。互相焊合。彌極牢固。於是乘客置身車中。其上下左右。遂不啻為鋼甲所環繞。則其絕對安全。殆可不言而喻。</p>
<p>寳塔克新車。與以前搆造不同之又一特色。則為採用大加改良之水壓塞車。配有雙層及三層封裹車制鼓。水與塵埃槪無侵入之虞。新車車門。闊度大增。而尤以雙門式各車為甚。極便上下。倍覺舒適。所有各式車輛。內部地位。均較寬暢。車座亦皆加闊。頭部地位大見增加。至於雙門式車輛之分隔式前座。則為新創式樣。尤覺出色當行。水箱與發動機罩。形式美觀悅目。翼翅板與車頭燈。均作瀉落式。V式屏風窗。向為車身特色之一。低價類車輛之裝用之者。實以寳塔克為第一。</p>
<p>寳塔克各式新車上之行李間地位。概大增加。轎式車輛。係於其後方特闢行李間。而備胎亦卽可藏置於其中。至於篷轎式車輛。則因裝配行李箱。故行季裝儎地位。尤為寬宏。關於機械方面。實塔克新車所具有之種種進步。尤覺不勝枚舉。膝灣動作部份。現裝置於二又四分之三寸之扭力管上。益臻鞏固。彌極安適。至於轉向輪比率。現增至十七·五比一。故轉向尤為便易。全部電氣系。容積大增。而開始發動。亦因而格外靈便。至於化油機歧管方而之種種改良。則使發動時所需要之轉熱時間。得以縮短。此外如潤滑系及保冷系。則仍保持原狀。按關於機械方面。最堪注意者。端推銀質合金接連桿軸承。緣此種合金。對於高速度駕駛時所生之大量熱度。其抵抗力實非以前所用任何金屬所可冀及也。寳塔克新車。較一九三四年式尤為堅强。如以重量而論。六缸四　　車　　　三千四百磅。至於改長　缸車。則為三千五百五十磅。要而言之。不論引擎底盤或車身方面。寳塔克蓋皆改良盡善。無懈可擊。此其安全·可靠·舒適·效用·以及經濟合算。所以無不出類拔萃也。</p>

<p>(Tianjin) At approximately 10 PM on the 29th, the No. 2 mine shaft of Zhao Ge Zhuang in the Kailuan mining area collapsed due to continuous rain and softened ground. Over 150 workers were trapped underground. After the accident, the mine's engineers immediately led hundreds of workers in rescue efforts. However, the collapse was too severe, and the mine was flooded with water several meters deep, making rescue difficult. As of late evening, no one had been rescued, and there was no hope for the survival of the 150 workers. The families of the workers, upon hearing the news, gathered at the mine, weeping and urging swift rescue. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to outside sources, the Kailuan Zhao Ge Zhuang coal mine's No. 2 mine shaft collapsed. After the mine made every effort to excavate and rescue, most had been rescued by the 30th. It has been ascertained that eleven workers are missing, and three have died underground. Their bodies have been found. The mine is continuing excavation. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Heavy rains in various counties of the Luan Yu region have continued until the 30th. The water levels of all rivers continue to rise, creating a vast expanse of water along both banks of the Luan River. The number of flooded farmlands and houses has increased. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Continuous heavy rains in eastern Luan have caused rivers to overflow, with ground water reaching a depth of more than a foot. The Kailuan Zhao Ge Zhuang coal mine experienced flooding on the evening of the 29th, when surface water eroded the tunnels and flooded the underground mine. After discovery, the engineering personnel were able to protect it effectively, preventing expansion. However, some workers were unable to escape while working and were drowned, resulting in three deaths and eleven missing. The accumulated water in the mine was drained by pumps by the morning of the 30th, and work has resumed as usual. The mine is currently discussing the arrangements for the deceased workers.

<p>(Tianjin) Another breach, about ten feet long, occurred in the stone embankment of the upper Luan River on the 28th. Nearby residents are trying to repair it. Farmlands on both banks have been flooded. Civilian ships and steamers have suspended operations. After the villages were flooded, Li Chang, the deputy, and others arrived in Luan County and petitioned County Magistrate Chen Zengshi for relief. The county government has telegraphed the provincial government for instructions. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Another breach, about ten feet long, occurred in the stone embankment of the upper Luan River on the evening of the 28th. The people are making every effort to repair it. Water from the breach is flooding inward, and there is no farmland that hasn't been flooded. Village chiefs and deputies have jointly appealed to the Luan County Magistrate to expedite disaster relief and repair the breach. Due to the rising waters of the Luan River, small steamers have also suspended operations for five days, completely cutting off waterway transportation. (30th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The rivers in Tianjin all rose slightly on the evening of the 30th. The Jin Tang Bridge, Jin Gang Bridge, and Hai River all rose by five inches. The Da Ji Bridge Southern Grand Canal and Ziya River rose by six inches, with a significant increase in flow. According to the Water Conservancy Association's assessment, they will continue to rise significantly in the next few days. The Southern Grand Canal Bureau received a telegram from Song Rong, a defense member of the first section, on the 30th, stating that from the 27th to the 29th, the water level had risen by another 3.13 inches, leaving only a few inches of the embankment above the water surface. The turbulent flow and recurring dangerous conditions make it extremely difficult to cope with the lack of funds and materials. He requested immediate assistance to prevent mistakes. Jiang Yankun, the Director of the River Bureau, and Zhao Mingxin, the supervisor, are scheduled to depart tomorrow to inspect the area. (30th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Due to several days of heavy rain in Tangshan City and disrupted transportation, commodity prices have soared. A 30-jin bag of rice has increased by one yuan, and a 30-jin bag of flour has increased by 70 cents. Each egg costs one cent. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 30th, the heavy rain in Tangshan continued without a break, resulting in a disaster. The Xinli Grain Market and streets were flooded with two to three feet of water, with streets eroded into ditches.

<p>Zhou Lisheng Returns to Peiping to Discuss Conditions in Southern Hebei</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhou Lisheng recently inspected the Southern Hebei area and returned to Peiping on the evening of the 29th. According to his account, he first went to Baoding Kaifeng Nian Tou and then inspected the north bank of the Yellow River, also visiting refugees in Changyuan. On his return trip, he visited Shijiazhuang. The main Yellow River embankment has not breached, but the people's embankments near Changyuan are quite dangerous, with tens of thousands of disaster victims urgently needing relief. The disaster situation in Southern Hebei is greater than in previous years, but still small compared to the entire country. The four large embankments on the south bank of the Yellow River are quite dangerous and are currently undergoing emergency repairs. The provincial government had previously decided to allocate 160,000 yuan for emergency repairs, but it has not yet been issued. He has already sent a request to urge the matter. If emergency repairs are not made, the future is worrisome. After the Taihang embankment was closed two years ago, the central government allocated 60,000 yuan for inspection, but only 20,000 yuan was used at the time, with the remaining 40,000 yuan being held by the River Affairs Bureau for reserve. He has now telegraphed the provincial government to order the return of the funds because there are still many dangerous conditions in the Taihang embankment. If it is not closed, a breach would allow the water to reach the Jin embankment. If the Jin embankment breaches, it would greatly affect the safety of Peiping and Tianjin, so it is necessary to do everything possible to close the breaches to avoid a major disaster. He inspected the political situation in several counties and will publish his findings after organizing them. In short, the people's suffering has reached an extreme. It is heard that a family of five spends no more than ten cents a day. This is due to political corruption, but the oppression of foreign economies is also a major factor. He will stay in Peiping for one or two weeks and continue to tour the counties to submit the findings and proposed solutions to the supervisory committee for approval and implementation. Furthermore, Zhou Lisheng telegraphed Shang Zhen on the 30th, requesting the prompt return of the 40,000+ yuan special funds borrowed by the River Affairs Bureau for repairing the Taihang embankment in order to carry out repairs and to allocate flood control funds at any time. River workers should constantly urge and ensure that funds and materials are not lacking and that protection is strengthened. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Shandong Representatives Investigate Dyke Construction in Northern Jiangsu, Rising Water in Weishan Lake Strains Northern Pei, Shao Hanyuan Overseeing Construction</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Sun Zorang, the director of a branch of the Shandong Rural Construction Research Institute, entrusted by the people of western Shandong, and two representatives of the people of western Shandong came to Xuzhou to investigate the dyke construction situation in northern Jiangsu. Sun and others went to Pei from Xuzhou this morning and inspected along the dyke. It was found that the dyke was built on the west bank of Weishan Lake and has nothing to do with Weishan water entering the canal. With the accumulation of lake water, there are two ways to discharge it: the Hukou Shuangzha and the Lanjia Ba. After Sun and others conducted an on-site investigation, they should be relieved. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Weishan Lake dyke in Tongjing has been progressing rapidly since construction began and will be completed by the end of the month. County Magistrate Wang Gongsuo is still overseeing construction on the Weishan bank. After completion, it was decided to build another Jing Mountain transverse dyke outside the main dyke. It was found that the Jing Mountain dyke is near the Lanjia Ba, and its construction can shield Lanjia Ba. Wang also scheduled to convene a comfort meeting for the township heads of the eastern dyke in Wuduan Zhacheng on August 2nd and 3rd. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) A Pei dispatch reported that the Weishan Lake water rose sharply yesterday, with a very fast current. Xiazhen on the northeast bank and Yangguantun on the northwest bank were both affected. The water level in the sixth district of Pei County rose far, and most of the land and houses along the lake were affected. The current is continuing to flow from the north bank to the south bank. The closest point of the water to the newly built western Weishan Lake dyke in northern Pei is less than a li, and northern Pei is under strain. Shao Hanyuan has been going to the dyke for days to oversee construction to prevent overflow and is expected to be completed in four or five days. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) A long-distance telephone call from Pei County this morning stated that the Weishan water rose sharply again by one zhang yesterday morning and is still rising. It was found that the reeds in Nanyang Lake had all been cut down by the Shandong people, so the water rushed down very quickly. The water head has approached the San Shui Lou in northern Pei. The Pei County government sent Wang, an administrative officer, to Xuzhou to buy sacks to transport to Pei for emergency repairs. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The various agencies and groups in Xuzhou, led by the county party headquarters, jointly telegraphed Provincial Chairman Chen and Construction Department Head Shen, requesting them to come to Xuzhou to inspect the large dyke and provide guidance on preventing the Yellow River. The general idea is that Weishan Lake is a large defense project in northern Jiangsu. If it is not strong, the Yellow River may seize the canal and enter the Huai River. Not only will the Huai River diversion project fail, but the flood and submersion damage to the counties in northern Jiangsu will be ten times greater than in southern Shandong. We dare to ask you to personally inspect, approve, and direct the rescue of the overall situation in northern Jiangsu. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Zhang Shouqian, Li Tianni, and Liu Xinwo, representatives of the various Yellow River disaster associations, inspected the Weishan Lake dyke construction and returned to Jinan today. They said that the Jiangsu dyke will be completed immediately, obstructing the water discharge, which will cause backflow, and the Jinpu Railway is at risk of being washed away. The people of Shandong are angry. If there is no proper solution, there may be an accident. The National Economic Commission telegraphed the Shandong Yellow River Disaster Association today, stating that it is currently consulting with Han Fuju and Li Yizhi to discuss a fundamental rectification plan that takes into account both Jiangsu and Shandong, without discrimination.

County magistrates who fail to suppress bandits will be severely punished after investigation. Song Kentang's division is currently besieging the bandits in Wenan and Ba County. Due to the heat, more than 30 soldiers have fainted from heatstroke, and several are missing. The two counties of Wenan and Ba are currently besieging the reed marshes and dividing them into nine districts to carry out the suppression. The province will be divided into thirteen districts, implementing the commissioner system after research. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Qi Wenping's remaining bandits, numbering 1,500, were discovered in Luotun, north of Luan County City, and seem to be trying to invade the county seat. Luan County City has been put on alert. Fearing that bandits will invade and kidnap students, the schools have advanced the summer vacation. (30th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e9">The Future of World Monetary Policy <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>Today, the various aspects of the world economy mostly present a scene of heavily fortified opposition and the sharp struggles arising from this opposition. Taking the currency issue as an example, there is the existence of inflationary monetary policies in countries like Britain and the United States, and at the same time, there are deflationary monetary policies in countries like France and Switzerland. The group of paper currencies and the group of gold are clearly in opposition, and the future of world monetary policy will depend on the outcome of this opposition and struggle.</p>
<p>Currently, the world economic panic is becoming increasingly profound, and overproduction is becoming more and more obvious. In order to prolong their existing economic organizations, various countries must reduce their currency values ​​to facilitate exports. Therefore, under this situation, in the struggle between the paper currency group and the gold group, the former stands in a position of superiority. For example, at the end of March this year, Belgium was suffering from a deteriorating economic situation. When its national unity cabinet was formed, it announced its departure from the gold standard, immediately causing the gold group to feel a sense of impending doom. This is one of the most obvious examples.</p>
<p>The method by which Belgium abandoned the gold standard is almost exactly the same as the means by which the United States abandoned the gold standard the year before last, namely: (1) the suspension of gold convertibility; (2) the reduction of the legal parity; and (3) the surplus gold after the parity reduction is used as an exchange equalization fund. This method of abandoning the gold standard can be said to be a characteristic of the late suspension of the gold standard. When various countries suspended the gold standard during the European War, the means were only the suspension of gold convertibility and the prohibition of gold exports. As for the reduction of parity, it was generally a means for restoring the gold standard system. But today it is different. The suspension of the gold standard is implemented simultaneously with the reduction of parity. The reason for this is to propose the exchange equalization fund. The result of the suspension of the gold standard is that the exchange rate on the market will tend to decline. In order to prevent the unsafe fluctuation after the exchange rate declines, it is necessary to rely on the exchange equalization fund, and the simultaneous advancement of parity reduction and the suspension of the gold standard is to nominally increase the gold reserves that have always been held. Then, the gold reserves nominally increased in this way are used as the only source of the exchange equalization fund. This kind of obtaining equalization funds by reducing parity is also a feature of today's world monetary policy.</p>
<p>Since this year, the fate of the world gold group has shown signs of disintegration. The Dutch government has implemented de facto exchange control to curb the outflow of gold. The Swiss government also has discussions on reducing the fineness of its currency. In May, the Italian government strictly ordered private individuals to hand over foreign securities held to banks and include them in the foreign exchange bureau's accounts, implementing tight foreign exchange control. On the 22nd of this month, it issued another order, relieving the Bank of Italy of its responsibility to have 40% cash reserves for the banknotes it issued. In reality, it has already abandoned its gold standard. This state of impending storm is enough to prove that the foundation of the gold group is already in a state of swaying and turbulent. As for France, which has always been known as the leader of the gold group, judging from its economic situation in recent years, the exchange rate is higher than the price level, unemployment has increased sharply, and the fiscal deficit is significant. In fact, it should have abandoned the gold standard long ago in order to break free. The main reason why it still wants to maintain the gold standard is that when France reduced the parity by one-fifth in 1928, it announced to the whole country that it would no longer cause the people to suffer losses. Therefore, although the economic situation has deteriorated day by day in recent years, the government still has to maintain the gold standard at a huge sacrifice.</p>
<p>Although the current financial situation in France seems to be slightly stable due to the passage of the Laval Cabinet's plenary powers law, in fact, the massive outflow of gold continues unabated. The French government blames this outflow of gold entirely on the result of speculation, but the facts show that it is obviously the inevitable result of the French gold standard fundamentally.</p>
<p>From the above discussion, it can be seen that the struggle between today's paper currency group and the gold group has actually reached the point of close combat. During this struggle, the gold group is in danger of failure. If the gold group suffers defeat in the future, the opposition between the two groups will naturally be reduced, and the opposition between gold and paper in world monetary policy will also be reduced. In other words, the countries in today's gold group will all join the group of paper standard countries, taking the same steps, and the future of world monetary policy will undergo a new transformation as a result.</p>

Seriously injured people were calling for help in the darkness, and their voices were extremely miserable. The corpses were lying on the ground, a tragic sight. Among the passengers who were killed, there were some well-known people, but the details are currently unknown. The total number of passengers was 8 in first class, 270 in second and third class, and about 300 including the security guards. Among them, 100 were injured and 20 died.

<p>(Changchun) The detailed report of the train attack incident is as follows: At 8:50 pm on the 29th, when the train was traveling at a point 67 miles between Tumenling and Yingchengzi, about 170 bandits who had attempted to attack had already removed the nails on the right side of the line. At this time, the train suddenly made a loud noise and overturned on the ground. The locomotive, baggage car, third-class car, and second-class dining car were crushed and fell to the ground one after another. The "bandits" lurking on the west side of the line immediately opened fire. Although the security guards came out to fight back, they were outnumbered. The "bandits" shouted, boarded the train together, and killed anyone they met with pistols, and began to loot property. At this time, a security guard escaped, carried his portable telephone, and rushed to Tumenling Station to report to his team and forwarded the message to Changchun. As of midnight, the number of dead and injured that had been identified was: 12 dead, including 8 Japanese, 3 "Manchukuo" people, and 1 Soviet person; 10 seriously injured, including 5 Japanese; 1 slightly injured Japanese; 5 missing Japanese and 20 "Manchurians." (30th, Communications Agency)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The "bandits" who kidnapped many Japanese and Manchurians have escaped from Tumenling to the northern mountains. The Japanese and Manchu armies are now pursuing them urgently. The mountains are sparsely wooded and hilly, with no place to hide. To the north is the turbid Songhua River, and to the southwest is the警戒京賓 Line, so it is very difficult for the "bandits" to escape. The kidnapped people should be rescued within a day or two. In addition, it seems that Director Gaozhu of the Jilin Office of the協和會 has also been kidnapped. (30th, Communications Agency)</p>
<p>(Changchun) Although the system and the leader of the bandits who robbed the train a few days ago have not yet been found, judging from their fierce and brutal behavior, they may be communists unique to Jilin. It is also possible that the incident occurred in what can be said to be the safest section of "Manchukuo." From this, it can be seen that the actions of this group of bandits were very thoughtful and a planned attack. (30th, Japan United News)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Communications has decided to start building 13 important national air routes next year. However, in order to ensure the absolute safety of the air routes, it also plans to start building a national aerial wireless network at the same time next year. This plan has already been included in the first phase of the 民問 aviation promotion plan, and about 8 million yuan is expected to be spent from the special accounting as the total cost. Therefore, about 1.5 million yuan will be needed next year. The plan includes the establishment of aviation-specific wireless stations at airports between Tokyo and Dalian, in addition to the aviation wireless radio station already set up by the Central Telecommunications Bureau. In addition, the existing wireless stations in eight places such as Fukuoka will be expanded, that is, in addition to the existing medium-wave wireless telegraph, short-wave wireless telephones will be added. This short-wave is specially used for air-to-ground communication to indicate the direction and location of the aircraft. As for the key points of the Northeast Air Route of Japan, such as Sendai, Aomori, and Sapporo, powerful aviation wireless radio stations will be newly established. In addition, a similar aviation wireless radio station will also be established near Songjiang on the Inner-North Korea Line. This year, it is planned to first complete the wireless equipment between Tokyo and Palau. In the future, the aviation wireless network connecting Hokkaido, Taiwan, the mandated territory, the mainland, and Dalian will be actively completed. (30th, China United Press)</p>

<h3 id="e14">British Admiralty Denies Seven-Year Shipbuilding Plan, Japanese Side Takes Great Pains to Estimate It <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>(London) The Admiralty today verbally stated that the Daily Mail's report yesterday on the British Navy's seven-year shipbuilding plan was purely speculation, and the Admiralty has decided to ignore it. This morning, various morning newspapers reported that a new shipbuilding procedure is currently being planned, but no final decision has been made. The Morning Post said that Britain is now facing a situation where it is necessary to build eleven new capital ships at the same time. The News Review reported that opinions within the government are quite divided, and the Admiralty also has different opinions on the best way to increase naval effectiveness. Some advocate gradually abolishing old ships, while others advocate quickly building German-style pocket battleships. (30th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Britain will invest a huge amount of £150 million over the seven years from 1936 to 1942 to establish a large shipbuilding plan, which has been reported in previous newspapers. According to an informal estimate by the Japanese naval authorities, the situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Capital ships: 14 ships, 490,000 tons</p>
<p>Aircraft carriers: 10 ships, 220,000 tons</p>
<p>Cruisers: 72 ships, 550,000 tons</p>
<p>Destroyers: 142 ships, 200,000 tons</p>
<p>Submarines: 57 ships, 70,000 tons</p>
<p>Total above: 295 ships, 1,530,000 tons</p>
<p>If the above plan is completed, the total strength possessed by the United Kingdom is estimated to be 1.52 million tons, an increase of about 340,000 tons compared to the existing strength of 1.1935 million tons, that is, an increase of more than 28%. However, the above estimate is based on the assumption that after replacing old ships with new ships, the old ships will be completely abolished. If they are not abolished, the total strength possessed will be nearly 2 million tons, obliterating the spirit of disarmament and openly implementing military expansion. Therefore, the Japanese navy believes that establishing this huge plan as the disarmament conference approaches is truly worrying for world peace. If the content of the shipbuilding declaration is also like this, it is better to observe it from the perspective of national defense and implement autonomous military preparations, then the financial effect will be vastly different. Therefore, there are quite a few people in the world who hold this view. (30th, Japan United News)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is reported that the British government expects the Washington and London Naval Treaties to expire and become invalid, and has issued a notice to naval powers such as Japan, the United States, France, and Italy, stating that from 1935 to 1942, it will invest £150 million in gold to liquidate old warships and build new and sharp navies. The Japanese government has not yet received its notice. However, if such news is true, the United Kingdom does have the intention to create an opportunity to realize a shipbuilding declaration in place of proportionalism, making the future of the disarmament conference even more confused. According to the Japanese navy, the British-attempted shipbuilding declaration case is similar to the Japanese proposal but not. The common maximum limit system advocated by Japan stipulates the minimum limit of armaments necessary for each country, and each country builds warships within its scope, so there is no need for a declaration at all. Especially a shipbuilding case that takes the amount possessed in 1942 as a certain standard is nothing more than an extension of this rateism. We cannot but oppose it.

<h3 id="e15">U.S. Government Appoints Economic Advisor to China, Mr. Booker is Familiar with Silver Issues <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Officials announced today that the government has appointed Mr. Booker as an inspector of China's economic situation, due to his familiarity with silver issues and other finances. Mr. Booker is currently a professor at Jinling University in Nanjing and has been reporting on China's economic situation to the Washington government for a long time. However, the nature of his reports has not been announced. Officials are unwilling to say whether this appointment is related to the British government's dispatch of its economic advisor, Mr. Leith-Ross, to China, only saying that he is a financial advisor to the U.S. Treasury Department. It is known that Mr. Booker is the person who recently divorced the "大地" writer Pearl S. Buck. (29th, National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The British government has sent Financial Advisor Sir Leith-Ross to China recently to investigate the monetary and financial situation in China. British people holding Chinese government bonds have therefore organized an action association a few days ago to negotiate with the British Foreign Office, requesting them to protect the interests of Chinese bondholders. During the House of Commons meeting today, Member of Parliament Linstr inquired Foreign Secretary Hoare about the results of this negotiation and what steps the government intends to take. Hoare replied, "Regarding this matter, the government cannot say anything more than what it has stated before. If there is any opportunity in the future that is beneficial to this request, the government will never let it go." (29th, Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Yesterday, the Chinese foreign exchange market fluctuated violently, which caused considerable concern in the United States. According to speculation by London financial circles this morning, the U.S. government seems likely to send a financial representative to Nanjing to jointly study the Chinese monetary situation with British financial representative Sir Leith-Ross and French representative Renault-Ciais. It is generally believed that the U.S. silver purchase policy has created various difficulties in China, and the United States has considered this. As for the purpose of the U.S. sending a financial representative to China, it is to cooperate with British and French representatives to find ways to alleviate China's monetary instability and facilitate China's economic recovery. The United States believes that China's economic recovery is a major condition for restoring world economic prosperity, so the United States attaches great importance to this move. It is also generally believed that after foreign experts go to China, they can allow the Chinese government to consider the recommendations made by various foreign governments and then decide to reform the Chinese monetary system.

<p>(Paris) It is generally believed here that the League of Nations Council meeting on Wednesday will surely pass peacefully and listen to Italy and Ethiopia negotiate a solution before August 25. Observers now believe that this dispute will still be handled by the Mediation Committee, but they believe that the real mediators are actually British Minister without Portfolio Eden and French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval. Eden will pass here today on his way to Geneva, and Laval will meet with him. At the same time, according to a Reuters telegram from Geneva, all sectors related to the League of Nations believe that the result of the meeting on Wednesday will depend on Britain's attitude. Judging from the current situation, Britain does not seem to agree to simply hand the dispute over to the Mediation Committee. There is no doubt that France is willing to postpone the matter for a week, but everyone feels that if Britain advocates it first, France will surely agree. It is generally believed that the League of Nations Council is unlikely to hold public meetings for a day or two this time, given the possibility of serious consequences. It will probably hold private talks to seek a common position. (30th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian delegation has departed for Geneva tonight, and Italy's participation in the League of Nations Council emergency meeting has become a certainty. However, it is still difficult to predict what attitude they will take in Geneva. Well-informed sources here say that Italy's attitude will depend on the development of the League of Nations debate. Italian officials believe that the League of Nations debate should be limited to deciding on future mediation procedures. Italy will probably be defended by a number of lawyers and experts. The leader of the delegation is Sir Aorosi. (29th, National Telegram)</p>

Polish Foreign Minister Beck and Czech Foreign Minister Benes will not attend. The Small Entente countries will be represented by Czech Envoy to Switzerland Silesky, while Czech Envoy to France Ususky will represent the Czech government. As for the British chief representative, Minister without Portfolio Eden, he will pass through Paris today and meet with French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval before arriving here by the same car tonight.

<p>(London) British cabinet member Eden departed by plane at 12:30 this afternoon. According to reliable sources, the British delegation is heading to Geneva without a fixed resolution on the attitude that Britain should adopt. Eden has the authority to make a plan according to the circumstances. However, it is expected that Eden's conversation with French Premier Laval in Paris this afternoon will allow Britain and France to reach an understanding on this attitude. It is likely that these statesmen will travel together to Geneva to attend the League of Nations Executive Council meeting tomorrow evening to discuss the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. According to custom, the first meeting of the Executive Council is not open to the public so that participants can draft an agenda. It is expected that before the meeting, Executive Council Chairman Litvinov, Laval, Eden, and Italian chief representative Aloisi will hold private talks. There are two key points in Britain's policy on the Italian-Abyssinian issue: one is to maintain peace, and the other is to uphold the authority of the League of Nations, as the League is the mechanism by which countries undertake to submit their disputes for resolution. The exchange of views between Britain and France has proven that the same is also the French government's objective. As for the procedures to be adopted in handling this matter, it will be decided by the League of Nations Executive Council. The general opinion, especially in Paris, is that a slight delay may be beneficial to the matter, as this period of hesitation may provide an opportunity for continued mediation, and the financial and economic impacts after the outbreak of war may also be factors in preventing war. It is widely believed that the Executive Council meeting will ask the Mediation Committee to continue its efforts to seek a resolution. If no result is achieved by August 25, the League of Nations will appoint a fifth arbitrator. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(London) According to well-informed sources, the British representative attending the League of Nations Executive Council meeting has been instructed by the government, before departing for Geneva, to adopt all possible means to resolve the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia in accordance with the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant. However, Britain maintains its original position, namely that the scope of the Executive Council's discussion should not be limited to the Walwal incident, but should be a comprehensive exploration of the issue of Italian-Abyssinian relations. If this procedure is adopted, the Executive Council may entrust the representatives of Britain, France, and Italy to seek a compromise within the framework of the League of Nations, in accordance with the 1906 Tripartite Treaty regarding Abyssinia. However, it should be noted that neither Italy nor Abyssinia should take advantage of this period of negotiations to engage in military preparations. To this end, Britain hopes that Italy will promise not to engage in war during the negotiation period. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>

Therefore, the total price of stocks and public debt has now increased by US$30 billion compared to before, a figure not much different from the current total national debt, and far exceeding the cost of the New Deal. (2) Automobile sales in the first half of the year increased by 31% compared to the same period last year. (3) Steel industry production is also more active than before. (4) Construction in the first half of the year increased by 51% compared to the same period last year. (5) Electricity industry production in the first half of the year increased by 7% compared to the same period last year. (6) Bank clearing increased by 8%. (7) The total value of agricultural products this year is US$8.5 billion, an increase of US$1 billion compared to last year. (8) The total profit of various commercial firms in the first half of the year increased by 2% compared to the same period last year. (National News Agency dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Congressmen representing the western gold and silver mining regions, seeing that President Roosevelt's wealth tax bill greatly harms the interests of the western gold and silver mining industry, have risen up to oppose the bill. Nevada Democratic Congressman Heron argues that the excess profits tax in the bill will greatly harm the interests of the gold and silver mining industry, so he asked the Senate Finance Committee to reconsider the bill before submitting it to the House of Representatives, but the Finance Committee replied that it was too late to save. Therefore, Heron has asked the silver-supporting congressmen in the House of Representatives to meet on Tuesday morning to discuss adding amendments. It is said that this amendment is roughly the same as the one added to the financial bill in 1918, namely that the profits of the gold and silver mining industry are exempt from the excess profits tax.

<h3 id="e33">British and German Journalists Kidnapped East of Zhangbei and Baochang: German Journalist Muller Released <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) British journalist Jones and German journalist Muller were kidnapped yesterday in the area east of Zhangbei and Baochang. After receiving the report, Qin Decun, Chairman of Chahar Province, who is recuperating in Beiping, telegraphed the Chahar Provincial Government to investigate the truth as soon as possible and find ways to rescue them quickly. According to related sources, the incident occurred in Baochang. The area where they were kidnapped is only maintained by local militia, whose strength may be relatively weak. This reporter visited Qin Decun this afternoon, but Qin was unable to meet due to illness. According to a person close to him, the Zhangjiakou telephone reported this matter this morning, stating that the British man Jones and the German man Muller held passports to travel to Erlian on the Zhangku Highway within Outer Mongolia, and were traveling by Deutsch-Asiatische Petroleum Gesellschaft car to Bailingmiao, Beile Temple, and other places. Then they went to Duolun. Yesterday, they took the original car back to Zhangjiakou, but did not take the Zhangduo highway, but instead took the dirt road to the northeast, heading south. When they traveled to Guanmazhou, 50 li northeast of Baochang, they were suddenly robbed by bandits. This is the correct official report obtained from Zhangyuan. It has been found that the foreign affairs of Chahar have just begun. The area of Baochang and Guyuan is maintained by a small number of security teams. The security teams have recently entered the area and are not familiar with the local situation, while the Guanmazhou area is close to the border line, with barren grass and sparse population, and there are no security teams. The two British and German journalists risked going deep, which led to the kidnapping incident. The provincial government has ordered the county magistrates of Baochang and Zhan Yuan and the security team leader to quickly dispatch personnel to investigate and search, hoping to cooperate in rescuing them as soon as possible. According to a spokesman for the British Embassy, after the embassy received a report that Jones had been kidnapped in the area east of Baochang, it telegraphed Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen, who is currently vacationing in Beidaihe, for instructions. At the same time, the embassy has notified the Beiping Military Branch to find ways to assist in the rescue. Military Attaché Shaw of the embassy is currently traveling in Outer Mongolia and has been telegraphed to ask him not to return to Beiping for the time being, and to go to Zhangyuan to cooperate with the Chahar Provincial Government in making every effort to rescue them. A spokesman for the German Embassy stated that German Ambassador Trautmann is currently vacationing in Beidaihe. The embassy has telegraphed the ambassador about Muller's kidnapping and has also notified the Beiping and Chahar provincial authorities separately, requesting them to find ways to rescue him as soon as possible. During the rescue period, the embassy does not intend to make any further statements. (Special dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The German journalist kidnapped in Chahar was released by the bandits on the 30th and will arrive in Zhangyuan on the 31st. The British journalist has not yet been released. The British Embassy has sent Counselor Sahanman to visit Wang Kemin at 10:00 AM on the 31st, asking him to expedite the rescue. It is reported that the bandits have put forward conditions, demanding 100,000 yuan and 200 automatic pistols. (Special dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a telegram from Zhangyuan this afternoon, Dr. Muller, a German journalist who was seized by bandits in Baochang on Saturday, has been released. It is reported that Muller is currently traveling by car to Zhangyuan, but Jones, who was also seized, is still being held. The British Embassy in China has lodged representations with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing and the Beiping Military Branch today. Qin Decun, Chairman of Chahar, is currently in Beiping. It is said that he has telegraphed the county magistrates of Baochang and Zhangyuan to find ways to rescue them. Jones is currently being held in the mountains northeast of Baochang. The Russian chauffeur and a Chinese servant who escaped from the bandits have now arrived in Zhangyuan. According to them, the kidnapping took place at Guanmakou (transliteration), 15 li northeast of Baochang. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The news of Muller's release was telegraphed by Muller himself from Baochang to Zhangyuan, saying that he had no clothes at all. The reason why Muller was released and Jones is still trapped in the bandits' den is not yet clear. People from all walks of life are very concerned about Jones, as he cannot speak Chinese, and it is feared that there is no one in the bandits who can speak English. Military Attaché Miller of the British Embassy went to Zhangyuan today. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>

<h3 id="e67">Dutch East Indies Anti-Chinese Issue: Diplomatic Negotiations. The Focus of Negotiations is on Overseas Chinese Laws and Immigration Restrictions. The Dutch Side Has Already Provided a Formal Response on the Issue of Legal Treatment. <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The Dutch East Indies has been actively implementing economic exclusion measures to resist foreign economic forces, particularly against overseas Chinese residing in the Dutch East Indies. This is because the number of Chinese residing in the Dutch East Indies is large, and their economic gains have been greatly harmed by these exclusionary measures. Since June of this year, hundreds of overseas Chinese residing in the Dutch East Indies have been forced to return to China due to these exclusionary measures, damaging the development of overseas Chinese trade. After receiving reports, the Chinese government instructed Jin Wensi, the Chinese envoy to the Netherlands, to negotiate with the Dutch Foreign Minister de Graeff and actively engage in talks. It is learned that Envoy Jin has recently submitted a report to the Chinese government detailing the negotiation process, which provides a detailed account of the two major issues of legal status for overseas Chinese and Dutch East Indies immigration restrictions. The details of this report, as well as the Chinese government's note to the Dutch Foreign Ministry and the Dutch Foreign Ministry's recent note to Envoy Jin, are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Issue of Restricting Immigration of Overseas Chinese <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Over 1.2 million overseas Chinese have gathered in the Dutch East Indies. The economic undertakings they operate not only occupy an important position there but also have a significant relationship with the domestic economy. Therefore, the relationship between China and the Netherlands is becoming increasingly complex, and all issues between the two countries must be resolved quickly and well to strengthen friendly relations. Since 1933, the Dutch East Indies has been affected by the global economic panic and proposed immigration restriction measures the year before last as a means of relief. The contents of the measures include: (1) Specifying the total annual immigration quota, which was set at 12,000 people for both last year and this year, to be evenly distributed among 15 nationalities; (2) If the number of entries does not reach the quota, the number of immigrants may be increased by each nationality, but may not exceed one-tenth of the total number of immigrants of that nationality to the Dutch East Indies during the ten consecutive years before the implementation of the new regulations; (3) After the quota limit is reached, only nationalities whose immigration quota has not been reached will be allowed to continue to immigrate until the limit is reached. When this regulation was first submitted to the Dutch East Indies National Assembly, all levels of Chinese society believed that if the regulation were passed and implemented, not only would the Chinese policy of emigration to the south be hit, but also the existing economic position of overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies would be fatally shaken. According to the average number of Chinese entering the country from 1923 to 1932, the annual average was approximately 29,200 people. Even according to the average from 1929 to 1932, the annual average was approximately 16,900 people. If the new immigration regulations are followed, the legal quota for Chinese immigrants each year would be only 800 people. Therefore, after the Chinese people heard this news, public opinion was turbulent and resentment was widespread. The former acting representative of the Chinese embassy in the Netherlands submitted very simple notes to the Dutch Foreign Ministry on June 29th and August 22nd of the same year, urging it to consider the status of overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies and to prevent the regulation from being passed hastily. Unfortunately, the Dutch East Indies National Assembly passed the immigration regulation on September 6th of the same year, and the Dutch government also approved it. After Envoy Jin Wensi took office, he repeatedly negotiated with the Dutch Foreign Ministry and urged it to respond as soon as possible. On December 4th, 1933, he sent a new note (original text attached) to the Dutch Foreign Ministry, explaining the government's views in detail based on the economic history and relationship of overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, their commercial status, and the unequal impact of the implementation of the new regulations on overseas Chinese. He urged the Dutch government to change its attitude and declared that it reserved the right to raise this issue again in the future. At the same time, he hoped that the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies would consider China's views when setting the annual immigration quota and requested that it adopt necessary measures to ensure that the provisions of Section 18, Item B, Section 1 of the new regulations could be implemented and that the statements made by the Dutch government representatives in the National Assembly could be fulfilled.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Issue of Equal Legal Treatment <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Article 163 of the Dutch East Indies Constitution stipulates that all Europeans, Americans, Japanese, and those born in other countries whose family laws are the same as Dutch law are collectively referred to as Europeans. Chinese and Arabs are collectively referred to as Eastern Foreign Residents. There are many points of unequal treatment. The most notable is that cases involving Europeans are tried by judges who are proficient in law, while this is not the case for Eastern Foreign Residents. Also, in criminal cases, Europeans are arrested by the court according to law, while Eastern Foreign Residents are arrested and detained by the police station. The facilities and treatment enjoyed by European detention centers and prisons are also superior to those of Eastern Foreign Residents. For these unequal treatments, our overseas Chinese have endured them for hundreds of years. After the success of the Northern Expedition of the Revolutionary Army and the establishment of the National Government in Nanjing, the foundation of unification was somewhat stabilized. The former Dutch Governor, Mr. Anobies Cornelis Dirk De Graef, the current Dutch Foreign Minister, stated in his speech at the opening of the 11th regular session of the National Assembly on June 15th, 1929: "The government of the Republic of China will promulgate a family law on January 1st of next year. If it can be implemented, the overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies can be treated equally with the Dutch in law." However, the family law promulgated by our country was implemented successively from May 5th, 1931, succeeding various laws in the 20th year of the Republic. The legal treatment of our overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies has not yet been equal to that of Europeans, Americans, and Japanese. Therefore, our country's diplomatic authorities stationed in the Netherlands have continued to negotiate with the Dutch government, hoping that overseas Chinese can obtain equal legal treatment. Recently, the Dutch Foreign Ministry sent a note to our country's embassy in the Netherlands on May 2nd of last year, stating that regarding the legal status of our country's overseas Chinese, except for the fact that the criminal procedure law still needs to be improved, in terms of civil law, civil procedure law, commercial law, and criminal law, they can be considered to be treated the same as Europeans. Envoy Jin reported this to the ministry and instructed Consul General Song in Batavia to conduct a thorough investigation, which confirmed that this was the actual situation. However, this matter still requires further effort in order to achieve satisfactory results. It is hoped that the people of the country will pay close attention to it at all times.

<p>Since its establishment, the Industry and Commerce Revitalization Council has been discussing the causes of the decline of industry and commerce and formulating revitalization plans. The deputy directors of the investigation team, Xi Yushu and Xu Xiaochu, together with the deputy chairmen of the committee, Wang Yansong and Jin Runxiang, and the deputy directors of various groups, Zhang Naiqi, Luo Qinghua, Yan Miaosheng, and Ren Jinping, have been meeting with leaders and experts from various industries according to the preliminary work procedure. Experts and leaders who have agreed to attend the meetings include Zhu Yangchen, Zhang Wuyun, Hu Juewen, Gao Shiheng, Zhou Bangjun, Zhang Huikang, Li Kangnian, Shen Weiting, Zheng Hairuo, and Ma Jisheng, among others. The opinions expressed are extremely valuable. It has been learned that Wang Yansong, the chairman of the council, has summarized the opinions of various parties and plans to first complete the investigation report on the scope of 43 industries. The content of this report focuses on two points: one is the internal and external causes of the decline of various industries, and the other is effective recommendations for rescuing the decline. At the same time, the implementation of the revitalization plan is also being planned and researched. Now, in order to speed up the completion of this report, Wang has specially sent letters to the leaders and experts of various industries, inviting them to serve as advisory committee members to jointly assist. The original letter and the list of advisory committee members are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Letter of Appointment <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Dear Sir, Since the attack of the economic panic has invaded our China, because the domestic industries have not had a sound organization, they have felt painful in self-defense. As a result, the phenomena of rural collapse, industrial and commercial decline, and financial turbulence have formed one after another. If we do not take this opportunity to rise up and strive for struggle, not only will we not be able to survive, but also the disaster of national subjugation and genocide will be inevitable. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, in view of this, organized this association based on the resolution of the Sixth Congress, in order to fulfill its responsibilities. However, this matter is of great importance and cannot be achieved overnight. It is necessary to gather experts widely, thoroughly explore the causes of the disease, and determine the plan. Then, the work can be carried out effectively. I have long admired you as the leader of an industry. Regarding the key to the decline of the industry and the development plan, you will not hesitate to impart your knowledge and guidance. Therefore, I am writing to invite you to serve as an advisory committee member of this association. I hope that you will be mindful of the national crisis and generously assist. This is my sincere hope.</p>

<p>The Great American Evening Post reports that the severe hurricane, which passed through Taiwan yesterday (the 29th) and last night at times exceeding 60 miles per hour, will spare Shanghai. However, Fuzhou is currently suffering a major blow. Although the wind speed has decreased to 30 miles per hour today (the 30th), navigation on the southern coast is still hindered. China Aviation's flights to Guangzhou did not depart as scheduled today. A Japanese plane flying from London to Tokyo, and an Italian government plane gifted to Chairman Chiang, were both stranded in Hong Kong due to poor weather. Shanghai's ships are operating as usual, but many ships heading south must have taken shelter in Anning yesterday. There are few or no ships traveling to or from Fuzhou and Xiamen today. The hurricane is moving west-northwest and landed today, so it will gradually diminish. Its center will strike slightly north of Fuzhou and south of Xiamen. The climate in Shanghai is very unstable, and there will likely be showers. Although the temperature is still quite high, the heat has been slightly reduced due to a gentle breeze.</p>

<p>The Shaanxi Provincial Government, previously for the construction of the Wei River Diversion Canal, specially sent Lei Baohua, Director of the Provincial Department of Construction, to Shanghai to negotiate. As a result, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Kincheng Bank, and the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank jointly loaned 1.5 million yuan. The loan contract was signed in Shanghai on November 15th of last year. The funds were to be disbursed in five installments starting from April 1st of this year. A reporter from the New News Agency learned from the Bank of China yesterday morning that the Shaanxi Provincial Government has already received two installments of the Wei River diversion loan this year, totaling 600,000 yuan. The construction of the Wei River diversion project is about to be completed, and the expenses used can be reduced according to the budget. The Shaanxi Provincial Government consulted with the lending banks and decided to reduce the Wei River diversion loan from 1.5 million yuan to 900,000 yuan or 1 million yuan, and a new contract will be revised separately. The representative of the banking syndicate, the Shaanxi office of the Bank of China, is currently negotiating directly with the Shaanxi Provincial Government, and it is generally nearing completion. Once the new contract is signed, it will be submitted to the Shanghai head office for record.</p>

<p>The China Press reports that American educator Dr. Schmitt believes that the United States' Far East policy is of utmost importance given the current situation, so he has come to the Far East to investigate everything on the ground. Dr. Schmitt has been a professor of modern history and chairman of the history department at the University of Chicago since 1925. He will stay in China for at least two months to investigate what he calls the "real situation." Dr. Schmitt is one of the leading historical writers in the United States today and is the author of "The Coming of the War", published in 1930. In 1931 he won the Pulitzer Prize for History. After touring Japan for a month, he took a short trip to Hong Kong and Manila and arrived in Shanghai on Sunday (the 28th). A representative of the China Press visited him. According to him, although many people in the United States are worried about war, they all earnestly hope not to be dragged into any war. Dr. Schmitt personally does not believe that war cannot be avoided, and said that if a war breaks out in the Far East, it will definitely be between Russia and Japan, not between Japan and the United States.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Lawyer Raven and Mr. Evans Protest to Mr. Hefford; Trial of the Case Will Be Held Around September or October <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The China Press reports that on Monday, Raven's lawyer, Mr. Evans, on behalf of Raven and the staff of the three companies formerly run by Raven that are currently being liquidated, sent a public letter to Mr. Hefford, the liquidator of the American Oriental Banking Corporation, protesting against the statements made by Mr. Hefford to news reporters regarding the handling of affairs of the related companies, saying that they impede the collection of rent by Probst, Hanbury &amp; Co., Ltd., and the liquidation of the other three companies. Although Mr. Hefford is responsible for speaking frankly without fear, it is hoped that in the future he will speak purely on facts and not criticize the former employees of the companies. The letter also refutes Mr. Hefford's claims that the American Oriental Banking Corporation was already empty and on the verge of bankruptcy before the liquidation, and that the bank's failure had nothing to do with the Shanghai monetary crunch. It states that Mr. Hefford should check the accounts of the American Oriental Banking Corporation, American Eastern Banking Corporation, Probst, Hanbury &amp; Co., Ltd., and Probst, Hanbury &amp; Co., Ltd., at the end of December 1934 to know the actual shares of the companies at that time. Near the end of 1934, the American Oriental Banking Corporation's cash reserves, as a proportion of deposits, were likely higher than those of other banks. Later, due to the monetary crunch, depositors rushed to withdraw money, resulting in the emptying of cash reserves. The fixed deposits of the other three companies, after maturity in previous years, were mostly renewed, accounting for 75% of the total. In the winter of 1934 and 1935, due to the extremely tight monetary situation, it was impossible to borrow cash from banks even with reliable securities as collateral. Therefore, depositors, needing money urgently, did not renew their deposits after maturity, and the three companies had to do their best to collect cash to meet the withdrawal of deposits. Their assets had not decreased compared to the past, and the total amount of their liabilities had not increased. When the companies were in urgent need, they had to borrow cash from the American Oriental Banking Corporation with their securities as collateral. Although the bank may not have lent money based on the shares of its affiliated companies, this is another issue entirely and should not be referred to as fraud or bankruptcy. The directors of the companies are all representatives of Shanghai's business community and are responsible. It seems unlikely that they would try to maintain a failing business or commit fraud. The letter was personally delivered to the representatives of the newspapers by Raven. Mr. Evans, after writing the letter, returned to Tianjin last Saturday and will come to Shanghai again when Raven's trial is scheduled. The trial of the case will probably not begin until around September or October, because Mr. Hefford's lawyer, Mr. Schletter, and Raven's lawyer, Mr. Evans, need time to prepare their arguments.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Yu Qiaqing Talks About Deciding to Resign as Chairman of the Shipping Association; Difficult to Compete with Japanese Ships; Joint Transportation Has Only Lip Service; Great Pain and Mixed Feelings; Resigning to Apologize <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Since the news of Mr. Yu Qiaqing's letter of resignation from the positions of standing committee member and chairman of the Shanghai Shipping Association and standing director of the China Shipping Cooperative Society was reported, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency specially visited Mr. Yu at the Sanbei Company to inquire about everything. Mr. Yu was kind enough to express his views as follows: I went to Japan to observe military exercises in the 16th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. After returning to China, seeing the rapid progress of the Meiji Restoration and the assistance of Prime Minister Ito and Viscount Shibusawa to the government, I was moved. Because I am a businessman, and the shipping industry is the crown of all businesses, and imitating Shibusawa's management of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha, I was determined to manage the shipping industry. The shipping industry is essential for the circulation of goods and convenient transportation, and it is also a powerful tool for military transportation in case of emergency. For forty years, I have been earnestly working towards this goal without懈怠. The steps I took were to first operate domestic shipping routes and then try to develop international shipping routes. Therefore, I founded Ning Shao, acquired Hong An, and operated the Sanbei and Ning Xing companies. However, the idea of international shipping routes has never been forgotten. Because there were few like-minded compatriots at that time, I expanded by borrowing money. I not only adhered to the above-mentioned principles, but also sought livelihoods for the majority of employees. I never considered my own interests. During that time, I repeatedly requested the government to formulate maritime laws to protect ship owners. The current status of Chinese ship crewmen is also an undeniable fact. The Customs, which was presided over by foreign advisors, originally stipulated that ships longer than 200 feet were not allowed to employ Chinese crewmen. I used my own ships and property as collateral to fight for the gradual insertion of people with experience from the deck and engine room. Because there were no suitable people at the time, people with experience, although slightly lower in academic qualifications, were able to cope with the service. This was originally a temporary expedient. Therefore, I further sought ways out for the graduates of the first Wusong Merchant Marine School, and levied an additional 30% tonnage tax from shipping colleagues to revive the Merchant Marine School and to support the establishment of the Maritime Affairs Bureau in order to recover the maritime administration operated by the Customs on behalf of the government. All of this came from a sincere enthusiasm. I never expected the shipping industry to decline day by day. The burdens have been added layer upon layer, and I am unable to save myself, which has earned me the rebuke of "spinning a cocoon around myself." I cannot help but sigh. The Shanghai Shipping Association was established out of necessity in July of the 16th year of the Republic of China. In November of the 20th year of the Republic of China, it was reorganized into the Shipping Industry Association. Since December of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, it has been renamed the Shipping Industry Association. I have been mistakenly elected by my colleagues to serve as president, member of the presidium, and chairman of the standing committee for eight years. The matter is obligatory, and it is also related to my own interests, so I have not dared to resign. During that time, I provided military transportation for the government and fought for the sovereignty of the industry, and I was exhausted. In recent years, the collapse of the rural economy, the financial crunch, and the decline of the shipping industry are unprecedented. The Japanese ships have lower expenses and are subsidized by the government, which makes it even more difficult to compete. At this time of exhaustion, at this critical moment of survival, this is not the day I should resign. However, a hundred feelings are mixed, and there is no end to them. After the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was nationalized and withdrew from the association, it formed a situation of confrontation between state-owned and private enterprises. Although the Provisional Constitution clearly stipulates the provisions for encouraging and protecting private shipping enterprises, they have not been realized. After several struggles for land and water combined transportation, private enterprises were allowed to receive the same treatment as state-owned enterprises by the government, but they have not yet been involved. Other measures clearly delineate boundaries. I have appealed to the government for relief for five years, but there has been only lip service, with no practical measures implemented. There is no hope of maintaining or developing. Looking back at the development of the Japanese shipping industry over the past forty years, with shipping routes all over the world, all its success lies in the cooperation between the government and the people, which has made it what it is today. How can it not be disheartening? The recovery of maritime rights and the development of international shipping routes are beyond my ability. I believe I am no longer capable of doing so. I depend on future talents. As for shipping cooperation, it is the only way to save the current difficulties and is supported by myself and all my colleagues. If it is handled impartially, it will be effective. However, the preparation and design has been going on for a year, and the establishment of the board of directors has been three months, but nothing has been done, as if it were a mere formality. I am ashamed of being a standing director, but after careful consideration of the situation and looking around the environment, the effectiveness has not been seen, and disputes have arisen again. In short, at this time, I can neither win the sympathy of the government nor live up to the expectations of my colleagues. If this continues, I will mislead myself and others, and it will become more and more serious. I can only sincerely resign from the positions of standing committee member and chairman of the Shipping Association and standing director of the Shipping Cooperative Society, and apologize to the government and my colleagues. I have already made up my mind.</p>

<p>After the entire Shanghai-Wuxi highway project was completed on the 15th of this month, the Shanghai-Wuxi Long-Distance Bus Company originally planned to send personnel on the 20th to inspect and take over the project. However, the representative of the Jiangsu Construction Department, Mei Chengchang, the director of the engineering office, went to Beijing on official business, so he was unable to take over. It was then rescheduled to be handled yesterday. Mr. Mei specially came to Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, he accompanied the company's representatives, including assistant manager Zhu Kaichou, director of the transportation department Wu Zhongyu, director of the business department Jiang Yuren, and staff member Ye Gongzhen, to travel by car. All the projects along the way were listed, inspected, received, and taken over. The procedures were very simple. The company has decided to hold a traffic ceremony at the Changshu station on the 15th of next month and has invited Mr. Chen Guofu, chairman of Jiangsu Province, and Mr. Wu Tiecheng, mayor of this city, to perform the ribbon-cutting ceremony to make it grand. The company's staff is currently busy preparing everything.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Hong Kong Taoist Society Sends Personnel to Shandong for Disaster Relief; China International Famine Relief Commission Cables Shandong and Han for Protection <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Taoist Society Relief Team believes that the Yellow River's water has surged this time, and the areas of northern Jiangsu and western Shandong have become a flooded country, with countless people and animals drowned and property losses that cannot be estimated. At this time when the government and the people are in mutual distress, it is impossible without the cooperation of all parts of the country to provide relief. The society's president, Chen Ruiji, out of his care and concern, personally donated a large sum of money and sent Chen Zhonghao, Feng Zaisheng, Huang Hengjie, Li Xiangquan, and other four people to Shanghai to transfer to Shandong to distribute emergency relief. Chen and others arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and stayed at the Great Eastern Hotel. Because they were unfamiliar with the people and the place, yesterday morning they specially took a letter to the China International Famine Relief Commission on Renji Road, requesting assistance in planning and instructing everything. The commission gave them a proper reception and promised to send a telegram to Han Fuju, chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, to send personnel to protect them and provide assistance. Chen and others took the Pinghu train north at 4:00 p.m. yesterday. The original letter from the group and the famine relief commission's telegram to Shandong and Han are recorded as follows: (1) Dear Sirs, disaster has struck China, the Yellow River is raging, the water is deep in the north and south, and the heat is intense in the east and west. At this time of poverty and financial exhaustion, looking around, there is no time for self-help, leaving millions of refugees waiting to die day and night. How can we not sigh? We and others, with the compassion to relieve disasters and distress, are willing to save the lives of the disaster victims, and we are willing to donate a large sum of money by our president, Mr. Chen Ruiji, out of his determination to relieve the hungry and the drowning. We have specially sent our staff to Shanghai from Hong Kong and are temporarily using the Great Eastern Hotel as our office. We will depart for Shandong within days, but the matter is complicated and we are unfamiliar with the people and the place. We have long admired your benevolence, and we are sure that you will have a well-thought-out plan for disaster relief work. We dare to send a letter, hoping that you will not hesitate to teach us and help us plan and guide us. We are sincerely grateful to you, the Shanghai China International Famine Relief Commission. (2) To Chairman Han of the Jinan Provincial Government, greetings from the Morality Society. The Hong Kong Taoist Society Relief Team, Chen Zhongmeng, Feng Zaisheng, Huang Hengjie, and Li Xiangquan, four members, departed from Shanghai by train on the afternoon of the 30th to personally distribute emergency relief in Shandong. Please order your subordinates to take extra care to protect them, send personnel to the station to receive everything, and provide detailed guidance to facilitate their work. We are deeply grateful, China International Famine Relief Commission, 30th.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Red Swastika Society Relief Team Reports That Yellow River Water Continues to Rise, Which Is Worrying <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The United General Office of the Southeast Chinese Societies of the World Red Swastika Society received reports yesterday from the relief commissioner and the Jining Red Swastika Society Relief Team, stating that the Yellow River's flooding and its relationship with Jiangsu Province, as well as the current miserable situation of the disaster victims in various counties, were so upsetting to read that they could not help but shed tears. Among the various sectors of Shanghai, there is no lack of benevolent people. Can they not be saddened by reading this?</p>
<p>Report from the Relief Commissioner The Red Swastika Society, upon receiving the news of the Yellow River breach, immediately sent a relief commissioner to the disaster areas of Ji, Jin, Yu, Zhen, and Yun counties to investigate the disaster situation. According to the report, this time the Yellow River breach, upstream on the south bank, has spread from Zhen County's Linpu gathering to He, Yun, Ju, Jia, Dong, and Wen counties. Recent measurements show that the main trend is southward, towards Shan, Ji, Ning, Jinxiang, Yutai, and then gradually entering Jiangsu Province via Tengyi. The area that has already been affected by the disaster is 300 li in both length and width, and there are more than 2 million disaster victims. At this time of entering the hot season, it is the period of continued rising water. If it continues to flow like this, it will swallow the canal and merge with the lake, not only causing disaster to southern Shandong, but also harming northern Jiangsu. If the channel is seized and the Yellow River shifts south, what a terrible change it would be. It is reported that Jiangsu Province has strengthened its defenses, and the work is very strong. It is hoped that all sectors of Jiangsu Province will cultivate good fortune, wear their hair disheveled, and coronate themselves in order to save the disaster-stricken areas. Invisibly, they can pray to avoid future disasters. Extreme poverty and calling out to heaven is the constant feeling of people. Doing good and receiving blessings is a clear instruction from ancient times.</p>
<p>Telegram from the Jining Red Swastika Society The flood this time is unprecedented. Our relief team set off by boat, but could only reach Jiaxiang and Juye from Jining, and could not reach Yuncheng, let alone Zhencheng. Along the way, the villages we saw, except for those that were completely washed away, had only rooftops left. Women, children, and the elderly, whether rich or poor, were either standing in the water, perched on rooftops, or gathered on broken embankments clinging to large trees, without clothes, food, or anyone to turn to, crying for help. It was unbearable to hear. The team members could not help but cry loudly at this terrible sight. Alas, who doesn't have parents, who doesn't have a wife and children? How can we not be saddened? The team members immediately gave them baked pancakes and fried noodles in the water and sent them to the receiving stations in various counties. The exact number of people and animals washed away cannot be investigated at this time because the flood has not receded. Under the hot sun, those disaster victims who cannot land are suffering from the heat, and at night they are exposed to the wind and dew. When it rains, they are covered in mud and water, and when it is sunny, their skin is scorched. If they are not rescued urgently, the living will gradually die. In the torrents and giant waves, are there not rich merchants and wealthy gentlemen, high officials and powerful gentry? Even if gold and silver are piled up like mountains, they cannot save themselves at this moment, let alone save others. From a well, you cannot save people. Now we are fortunate to be above the well, so it is a good time to save people. Saving people is saving ourselves, this is the time! Recently, more than 1,000 disaster victims who have escaped from Jining and Jiaxiang arrive at the train station every day. Our society gives each person one jin of steamed buns every morning and evening. In four days, we have boarded more than 8,000 people. It is still unknown how many more cannot get out of the water. We urge all societies to appeal to all sectors of society to send teams to the disaster areas as soon as possible, hire more boats, prepare more dry food, and bring more medicines to rush to the rescue. We sincerely cry out and beg for the disaster victims in western Shandong, and await your telegram in response.</p>

<p>Central News Agency reports that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, in order to strengthen Sino-Italian relations, specially gifted Chairman Chiang a new Savoia-Marchetti S.72 plane, piloted by Colonel Scaroni and Major Tondi. They arrived in Hong Kong on the 28th. It was originally scheduled to fly to Shanghai the next day, but it was delayed due to bad weather along the way. According to the reporter's inquiry at the Italian Embassy in this city, the plane was still stranded in Hong Kong on the 30th. It is expected that the weather will improve on the 31st and it can fly to Shanghai, arriving at Longhua Airport around 3:00 or 4:00 p.m. At that time, the Italian embassy and consulate will send personnel to welcome and take care of them.</p>

<p>Since the Central Trust Bureau was approved by the Executive Yuan and ordered to be actively prepared by the Central Bank, it has been ready for a long time and has established various rules and regulations, which have been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval and can be opened for business. The bank held a board meeting the day before yesterday to discuss the candidates for directors and director of the bureau. It was decided to nominate Kong Xiangxi, Zhang Gongquan, Xu Kan, Ye Zhuotang, and Song Ziliang as directors, with Kong Xiangxi also serving as chairman. As for the position of director, it will be selected from the directors. Two deputy directors have also been decided and will be announced in the coming days. It is said that the bureau has been ordered to take over the business of the Sino-French Savings Society. After sending personnel to receive them separately, the matter will be temporarily put aside. Once the bureau starts business, it can resume the collection and settlement of the savings.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the Local Yellow Wine Industry Association, requesting the Ministry of Finance to approve the reference to the alcohol method, that is, all local yellow wine sold in the Chinese area should pay the full tax, and the sales in the special zone should be temporarily tax-exempt to relieve merchants' difficulties. After forwarding the telegram, the Ministry of Finance replied yesterday, "We have received your telegram, Dai. After the alcohol tax was changed to a unified tax, Chinese factories in the concession have complied. However, because a few foreign factories used treaties as an excuse to refuse to pay taxes, the Tax Affairs Department has discussed boycott methods. For the alcohol designated by Chinese factories to be sold in the concession, they are allowed to temporarily account for it. This method is temporary. Once foreign factories comply, it should be cancelled. There have been precedents when unified taxes were opened for cigarettes and other items. If local yellow wine is purely manufactured by Chinese merchants and has no relationship with foreign merchants, there is no boycott to speak of. How can it be referred to? The Local Yellow Wine Industry Association of Shanghai requested to retain the half-tax stamp on sales in the concession when the local wine was changed to a fixed tax two years ago. Now, it is advancing to demand tax exemption, which is not in line with the situation. You should immediately forward instructions to the association to notify all the same trades to pay taxes according to the regulations and not to bother us again."</p>

<p>The National Federation of Commerce yesterday sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance of the National Government, requesting the immediate allocation of Guangdong Province lottery bonds to provide relief. The original telegram stated (brief summary): "We have received a letter from the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Commerce stating that our province has been affected by the global economic recession, resulting in financial depletion, commercial collapse, and the near bankruptcy of rural areas and factories. Various chambers of commerce and citizens have repeatedly sent letters and telegrams to our association, stating that the Ministry of Finance, while in Guangdong, issued the first, second, and third lottery bonds, which have been outstanding for ten years without repayment of principal and interest. They jointly request that we forward this to the central government for immediate allocation to provide relief. This bond was originally issued by the Ministry of Finance in Guangdong to fund the Northern Expedition. On September 11, 1929, the 195th meeting of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang resolved that the central government would be responsible for repayment. Furthermore, the National Government has already repaid the bonds issued in Hubei and is in the process of settling the securities issued during the warlord era in Beiping, repaying them on schedule. However, our province's first, second, and third lottery bonds have been uniquely delayed indefinitely. It is only fair that the debts owed to the people and businesses of Guangdong Province be cleared early to revive commerce." The telegram urges that the Federation of Commerce petition the central government to expedite the repayment to help relieve financial difficulties. The telegram from the Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce, Lin Kanghou, is respectfully submitted.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Salvation of Black Fever Sufferers: Hope to Establish Branch Offices in Counties for Universal Relief <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Black fever, originating from north of the Yangtze River, spreads rapidly and is often fatal. Recently, Wang Junshu, a respected gentleman from Huaiyin, Jiangsu Province, came to Shanghai to share a remarkably effective secret remedy, which has been repeatedly reported in the past and has attracted attention from all sectors, prompting generous donations of medicine. Since Mr. Wang came to Shanghai to purchase large quantities of medicine and could not stay long, he entrusted the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Charity Relief Association on Renji Road to receive donations and help the masses. The association recently received a letter from Mr. Wang, which is transcribed below: "Received your letter and remittance of 4,400 silver dollars, which is acknowledged. The number of people seeking medicine for black fever is increasing daily, adding approximately 20 to 30 people each day, which is unstoppable. Currently, we need to administer three doses of medicine daily, and some people travel over a hundred miles to obtain it. At present it is the hot summer and it is already like this. The amount of medicine needed daily is difficult to predict. If charities can set up branch offices in each county, relief can be provided universally, and our operations will not be overwhelmed. Manufacturing the medicine is a complex process, and the honey pills must be made by hand. Entrusting a pharmacy to manufacture the medicine is unreliable, and we are concerned that they may not be able to keep up with demand. Therefore, we will look for multiple pharmacies to manufacture the medicine, which will increase labor costs and make it difficult to monitor. Currently, we are building three tin-roofed rooms in the backyard of the pharmacy to be used specifically for manufacturing the medicine. We are also building a furnace for refining copper sulfate, which will require one or two additional workers. Those who come to the pharmacy to seek medicine are divided into two categories: those who have already received medicine and those who have not. Those who have already received medicine must be asked about their condition after taking the medicine, and details must be noted on a form. Those who have not received medicine must be asked about their name, age, place of origin, address, date of onset, and symptoms, and details must be noted on a form, along with the date of medication. Each person is given four days' worth of medicine, and they must return on the fifth day to report their symptoms and effectiveness, which must be recorded on a form before another four days' worth of medicine is given. This procedure may seem tedious, but it is necessary to obtain accurate information. It would be best to ask the Red Cross to send people north to establish branch offices in each county, which would provide more widespread relief. Refining copper sulfate is the most labor-intensive part of the manufacturing process, which we can do here. The other ingredients can be mixed independently. The medicine should be mainly in the form of pills, supplemented by medicinal wine and plaster. The pills alone can cure the disease. The medicinal wine is not suitable for young children and should not be consumed in large quantities by women, so little wine is used. Two ingredients in the plaster are extremely difficult to find, and even if found, they are not available in large quantities. Therefore, we should use whatever is available. The focus should remain on the pills. Please inform the Red Cross that it would be best if many philanthropists set up offices in each county to eradicate this disease." This letter was from Wang Bao-huai. It is reported that the association has conveyed this to the Red Cross, hoping that they can find a way to establish branch offices in each county to provide universal relief to the people. Although there are people who continue to donate money and medicine, the road ahead is long, and the need for funds is vast. It is hoped that philanthropists will work together to maintain this effort, and that many hands will make light work.</p>
<h3 id="e99">After the Sinking of the Xin Maoli Steamer: No Proper Arrangements for the Victims; Dinghai Fellow Townsmen in Shanghai Meet to Discuss Solutions <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The Xin Maoli steamer sank at the Dinghai Wharf on July 13. The tragic deaths of the passengers and the circumstances of the rescue were detailed in the Dinghai Zhou Newspaper. Over half a month has passed, and the shipping company has made no statement regarding its responsibility for the tragedy, nor has it announced any arrangements for the aftermath. The Dinghai Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai believes that since the accident occurred in Dinghai and many of the victims were from Taizhou and Dinghai, it is inappropriate to remain silent. Therefore, a 14th Standing Committee Meeting was convened on Monday, July 29, to discuss solutions. The attending members were Yuan Yang'an, Chen Gengxin (representing Yuan Yang'an), Pan Shanglin, Zhu Baofeng (representing Pan Shanglin), and Zhou Xiangsheng. The attendees were Ding Zihua, Lu Ruixing, Chen Dafang, Jiang Xinzhao (Jiang Mengyun), Le Nanting, and Hu Zhizhai. Yuan Yang'an chaired the meeting, and Hu Zhizhai recorded the minutes. (A) Report Items: The chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, followed by Jiang Mengyun's report on the sinking of the Xin Maoli steamer, citing three reasons: 1. The steamer was a used vessel purchased from abroad. 2. The cargo was loaded too high, making it top-heavy. 3. The doors were too low, making it easy for water to enter. He said that before the voyage, he had visited the ship and specialists had already noted the various dangers. The Maritime Administration, as the governing body, ignored these points. If the steamer had been thoroughly inspected, this tragedy would not have occurred. Therefore, this tragedy was not an act of God but entirely man-made. (B) Discussion Items: What should be done regarding the Xin Maoli steamer tragedy? Resolutions: 1. Send a letter to the Dinghai County Government to investigate thoroughly. 2. Send personnel to Dinghai to investigate the truth. 3. Petition the Ministry of Communications to send personnel to investigate thoroughly. 4. Work together with the Taizhou Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai to handle the matter. 5. Organize a tragedy committee to be responsible for handling the matter. Chen Dafang, Lu Shoulun, Shen Rongan, Zhou Xiangsheng, Pan Shanglin, Jiang Mengyun, and Yuan Yang'an were appointed as committee members. It was also decided that a special committee discussion would be held this Wednesday (July 31).</p>

<p>The National Products Exposition on Nanjing Road was originally scheduled to open tomorrow (August 1). Factories in Shanghai that participated had already begun preparation. However, the National Products Exposition has received letters requesting participation from factories in other locations, such as Suzhou and Hangzhou. The letters also request that the opening date is slightly delayed so that these factories can hurry to Shanghai for preparation. The flood relief entertainment event of Shanghai also send their representatives to contact the National Products Exposition, intending to hold a fund-raising event at the exposition. Both parties have come to an agreement. After deliberation, the exposition decides to approve the request to postpone the opening date to August 5, opening at the same time as the flood relief entertainment event, in order to expand advertisement. The exposition already sent a notice to national products factories in Shanghai. The notice states: "We are sending this letter to inform you that the opening of the National Products Exposition, which was originally scheduled for August 1st, has been changed as the Shanghai flood relief entertainment event will be held at the remaining space of the exposition, scheduled to open at the same time as the commercial sector. The event requests for a postponement, as factories in Suzhou and Hangzhou also sent letters requesting a postponement to participate. After the deliberation of the board, it was decided to postpone the opening to August 5 so that all parties can have adequate time to prepare. Beside informing the flood relief entertainment event to speed up preparation, we are also informing you to let you know. Please take note, and please send people to the exposition to decorate from today until the 3rd. Given the fundraising entertainment event, it is expected that people from home and abroad will participate.

<h3 id="e103">Shanghai Municipal Council's Reasons for Not Prosecuting the Da Zhonghua Case <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the fire at the Da Zhonghua Celluloid Factory on Xiaoshadu Road last month, which caused extensive damage and spread to nearby residences, there have been inquiries about whether the Shanghai Municipal Council has taken any action. The explosion and fire at the factory were a major incident, resulting in 25 deaths and 44 injuries. The Shanghai Municipal Council is deeply concerned about this matter, but it has not been able to take any legal action. According to the Criminal Procedure Law of the Republic of China, if the injured parties file a private prosecution, the local authorities cannot simultaneously file a public prosecution. In the Da Zhonghua case, the families of the victims and the injured have already filed a private prosecution with the First Special District Court after the incident. The First Special District Court has also held several hearings on the case. Due to the provisions of the procedural law, the Shanghai Municipal Council cannot file a public prosecution. However, it can provide all available evidence to the families of the victims and the court for reference. Furthermore, the Shanghai Municipal Council does not intend to issue any formal statement before the case is concluded.</p>

<p>The Jinghu and Huhangyong Railway Administration yesterday issued a notice to restore the original timetable for passenger trains on the Hangzhou Section Gongchen Bridge branch line: "Since the Gongchen Bridge branch line passenger trains were changed to stop at the Gongchen Bridge Station Dengyun Bridge freight platform, and because the platform lacks shunt line equipment, the shunting process was time-consuming, the train schedule was slightly changed. Now, the station's shunting lines have been relaid, making shunting easier. It is hereby decided that from August 1 (today), all passenger trains on the branch line, except for train numbers 217 and 218, will resume operation according to the times specified in the current No. 5 timetable. All timetables specified in the previous Notice No. 397 will be canceled from the same date.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Rickshaw Owners Petition on Behalf of Rickshaw Pullers Against Compulsory Registration: Unsatisfactory Outcome <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The French Concession Police Department's plan to implement compulsory registration for public rickshaw pullers from August 1 has caused unanimous opposition from rickshaw owners and pullers. The Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Association sent representatives Zhang Chuanyang, Qian Yuanjin, and Song Yaokun, with a petition, to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to request representative Yuan Hongjun to petition the Police Department. The head of the department, Guan Xuan, and the head of the station, Bo Ze, personally received the representatives, indicating that it was inconvenient to negotiate the rickshaw owners' request to suspend registration for now. If the rickshaw owners approve the registration, other issues cannot be accommodated. The representatives argued that although the 7,100 rickshaw licenses were donated by 195 people, there were over a thousand rickshaw owners, and even if the owners agree, each rickshaw puller has freedom, so they could not act on their behalf. Moreover, the association's petition was based on the resolution passed by the general assembly, and they could not change the proposal casually. Therefore, the outcome of the negotiations was not satisfactory. According to observers, if both parties hold extreme positions without a compromise, disputes will inevitably arise. The original petition from the Rickshaw Industry Association is transcribed below: "We, the Rickshaw Industry Association, respectfully submit this petition regarding the French Concession's public rickshaw puller registration. We have received instructions from your department to complete the registration within a specified period and have posted the processing methods. According to reports from rickshaw owners, although the owners have repeatedly advised the rickshaw pullers to comply with the regulations and register, the pullers' previous experiences of the police arbitrarily seizing permits and imposing heavy fines have made them fear the police department. Therefore, even if this registration is out of the good intentions and policies of the authorities, the rickshaw pullers find it difficult to trust. Moreover, the rickshaw pullers work hard all day, with calloused hands and feet, barely able to feed themselves, and the registration fees are too burdensome. Therefore, they unanimously refuse to register, declaring that they would rather be beggars and starve to death than register. Their attitude is firm, leaving the rickshaw owners with no options. If the owners force them, the pullers will inevitably abandon their rickshaws, which would greatly harm the rickshaw owners' business and impact municipal traffic. The public is worried. Please request the French Concession Police Department to consider the difficulties of the rickshaw industry and revoke the order. Your department's registration of rickshaw pullers only allows rickshaw owners to advertise and advise rickshaw pullers, and the right to register remains with the rickshaw pullers. Since the rickshaw pullers have unanimously expressed their opposition, it is necessary to carefully consider and re-evaluate the situation. We have heard that your department plans to ban unregistered vehicles from operating and force rickshaw pullers to register. If this is implemented, it will cause external disputes and greatly harm the rickshaw owners' business, which is not a good phenomenon for municipal traffic. Therefore, we have sent three committee members, Zhang Huaiyang, Yu Dakin, and Song Yaokun, to pay our respects and present the matter in person. We hope that you will grant us an audience and consider the difficulties of the rickshaw owners, revoking the order to register rickshaw pullers."</p>

<p>The Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that the Haikuo patrol ship Guanwei seized a Japanese motorboat off Songkou on June 1, confiscating a large batch of smuggled artificial silk, worth about 100,000 yuan. The patrol ship's captain, a British man named Baker, due to bonus issues, indignantly had the Japanese Consul General issue an affidavit proving that the artificial silk was seized outside of Chinese territorial waters. Later, Haikuo pointed out that the affidavit was not in the correct format, so it was re-issued at the British Consulate General. As a result, Japanese lawyer Okamoto, representing the cargo owner, requested Haikuo to return the confiscated goods, stating that the goods were being transported from Lushunkou to Hong Kong. Haikuo claimed that the smuggled goods were intended to be unloaded near the Shanghai coast and had already been confiscated and auctioned off. Okamoto issued three letters, but received no response. Therefore, on July 25, he made a formal request, setting a three-day deadline for a response. Haikuo has not yet responded, so Okamoto is considering further action.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Case of China Industrial Bank: Court Notifies Settlement Plan, Creditors' Meeting Scheduled for This Afternoon to Discuss and Resolve Lu Xihou's Settlement Plan <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The China Industrial Bank has been in liquidation since its collapse on October 11th of last year, and the court has yet to make a decision. The court-appointed accountant, Xu Yongzuo, is in charge of the liquidation. It is now known that the First Special District Court issued a notice and a settlement plan yesterday. A meeting of creditors is scheduled for 1:00 PM today at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to discuss and resolve the matter. The court's notice and settlement plan are detailed below:</p>
<p>Court Notice: The First Special District Court of Jiangsu and Shanghai issued a notice yesterday, stating: "Regarding the case of Lu Xihou, Lu Mengxiang, et al., being declared bankrupt by the China Industrial Bank, a creditors' meeting is scheduled for 1:00 PM on July 31st of this year at the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, located at the corner of North Henan Road and North Suzhou Road in Shanghai. Creditors are required to bring their debt registration certificate and creditors' meeting admission card to attend the meeting on time. If unable to attend in person, a representative may be appointed with a power of attorney. In addition to sending a summary of the settlement plan, this notice is hereby given. Included are a summary of the settlement plan, a ballot, and nine yes/no votes. This notice is issued to the creditors of the China Industrial Bank."</p>
<p>Settlement Plan: Lu Xihou, Lu Mengxiang, et al., the debtors of the China Industrial Bank who declared bankruptcy, proposed the following summary of the settlement plan: "The total amount of debt owed by the China Industrial Bank is now proposed to be settled at forty percent (i.e., forty yuan for every hundred yuan). Of this, twenty percent will first be paid off from the proceeds of the sale of all assets of the China Industrial Bank. If the proceeds are insufficient to cover the aforementioned twenty percent, the shortfall will be covered by Lu Xihou. In addition to the aforementioned twenty percent, for the remaining twenty percent to be paid, the debtors will separately sue the debtors of the China Industrial Bank to recover the debts. If the amount recovered exceeds twenty percent of the total liabilities of the China Industrial Bank, it will still be distributed to the creditors in proportion to the total amount of debt. If the amount recovered is less than twenty percent of the total liabilities, the shortfall will still be covered by Lu Xihou."</p>
<h3 id="e114">Aviation Lottery: Explanation of Drawing Procedures <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The National Government Aviation Highway Construction Lottery has been issued for twelve periods. In order to improve the process, the office submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to change the drawing to once a month starting from the thirteenth period, and to reduce the number of tickets to 300,000. The number of winning tickets has been increased compared to the past, which is likely to attract the interest of ticket buyers. Sales for this period have been brisk, as already reported in various newspapers. As the drawing for the thirteenth period is approaching (August 9th), this reporter visited the office to inquire. According to the person in charge, in order to make the drawing procedures clear to ticket buyers, they are planning to print an explanation of the drawing process, so that people can fully understand it. The detailed drawing method and accompanying diagrams are detailed below for the benefit of readers.</p>
<p>Copper Drawing Machines: The drawing uses three copper machines (A, B, and C), mounted on iron stands. The machines are surrounded by semi-circular steel frames, allowing them to rotate freely. The interior of each machine is equipped with copper gears and wooden agitators. When the machine rotates, it agitates the small balls stored inside, evenly distributing them as they pass through the copper gears. Both the top and bottom of each machine are equipped with butterfly-shaped spring gates, releasing one small ball at a time, which rolls along a copper groove into a glass container.</p>
<p>Two Types of Balls: The small balls are divided into two types: ticket number balls and prize level balls, all made of pomelo wood. (1) The ticket number balls are placed in machines A and B. Machine A is larger, containing 3,000 ticket number balls, numbered from "0000" to "2999," representing the first four digits of the ticket number. Machine B is smaller, containing 100 ticket number balls, numbered from "00" to "99," representing the last two digits of the ticket number. (2) The prize level balls are placed in machine C, totaling 125. Among them, one is engraved with "1," four with "2," twenty with "3," and one hundred with "4." For example, if the prize level ball drawn is "1," it is the first prize. If "4" is drawn, it is the fourth prize. For the fifth prize (300 winners) and the sixth prize (600 winners), after the 125 prize level balls have been drawn, 1,000 ticket number balls, numbered from "000" to "999," are prepared separately, injected into machine C, mixed evenly, and three balls are drawn in sequence. All tickets whose last three digits match the three digits on the first ball drawn win the fifth prize. Tickets whose last three digits match the three digits on the second or third ball drawn win the sixth prize. For example, if the first ball is "213," the second ball is "465," and the third ball is "987," then all tickets whose last three digits are "213" win the fifth prize, and those whose last three digits are "465" or "987" win the sixth prize. All tickets whose last two digits match the last two digits of the first prize number win the seventh prize. Tickets whose last digit matches the last digit of the first prize number win the eighth prize, but those who have already won the seventh prize cannot also claim the eighth prize. The tickets with numbers immediately above and below the first prize number win the first prize consolation prize. For example, if the first prize number is "123456," then the numbers "123455" and "123457" win the first prize consolation prize. The tickets with numbers immediately above and below each of the second prize numbers win the second prize consolation prize. Since there are four second prize numbers, there are a total of eight second prize consolation prizes.</p>
<p>Drawing Order: During the drawing, supervisory committee members appointed by the National Government Aviation Highway Construction Lottery Committee, together with representatives from the local court, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Bankers' Association, will be present to supervise. First, the machines and balls used for the drawing are inspected in public. After the inspection, the balls are injected into the respective machines, and after multiple agitations, the drawing begins. All three machines simultaneously release one small ball, which rolls into the glass container at the end of each groove. The announcers standing beside the machines take out the balls under their charge and announce them in order. First, announcer A announces the four-digit number drawn from machine A. Next, announcer B announces the two-digit number drawn from machine B. Finally, announcer C announces the number on the ball drawn from machine C. The numbers on the two balls drawn from machines A and B are combined and read in order, which is the winning ticket number. The number on the ball drawn from machine C is the prize level won by that ticket. For example, if the number drawn from machine A is "1234," the number drawn from machine B is "56," and the number drawn from machine C is "1," then ticket number 123456 wins the first prize. If the number drawn from machine C is "4," then ticket number 123456 wins the fourth prize, and so on.</p>
<p>Strict Supervision: Each ticket number ball and prize level ball drawn is embedded on a ball board. In addition to reporting the numbers clearly under strict supervision, major prizes must be passed to the supervisory personnel for inspection, and the numbers on all three balls are photographed to emphasize their importance. The ticket number balls drawn from machines A and B are returned to their respective machines for continued drawing after verification, so that each ticket has an equal chance of winning. However, the prize level balls drawn from machine C are not returned. If the number of a small ball drawn from machines A and B has already won a prize, then any duplicate numbers drawn from the second time onwards will be considered invalid and immediately re-shuffled with the prize level balls drawn from machine C and re-drawn. A diagram is attached above.</p>

<p>At 8:30 PM the night before last, a fire broke out accidentally in the shantytown area south of Yangjiadu Beicaoni Pond in Pudong. The bamboo walls and thatched roofs were all highly flammable, causing the fire to spread rapidly. In addition, the southeasterly wind was exceptionally strong, adding fuel to the flames, which spread uncontrollably.</p>
<p>Although Director Zhao of the Shantou District Fire Brigade, Standing Committee Member Shen Yu of the Yangjing Town Fire Brigade, and other fire brigades from Laobaidu Tangqiao dispatched personnel to assist in the rescue efforts, they were unsuccessful. Hundreds of straw houses in the area were</p>
<p>Completely Destroyed within Three Hours. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that Yang Zhongquan, the police chief of the Yangjiadu Police Station in charge of the area, ordered senior officers to investigate yesterday morning and estimated that approximately 700 straw sheds were destroyed or demolished, affecting approximately 500 households and</p>
<p>Over 5,000 Disaster Victims, including men, women, children, and the elderly. The severity of the disaster was greater than the previous fires. Furthermore, the Yangjing District Sixth Literacy School, located in Xichang Dongli in the area, was in session when the fire broke out. The students rushed home to salvage their belongings, and the teachers also hurriedly moved school equipment and books. Fortunately, the school building was saved by the firefighters' efforts, but</p>
<p>School Equipment and Books were Lost. The person responsible for the fire has been identified by the police station as Xu Zhengkai (also known as Xu), a native of Jiangbei. Xu had four straw sheds. Xu, his wife Wang, and his grandson lived in the two southern sheds, and his daughter-in-law lived in the two northern sheds. The cause of the fire is said to be that when catching bedbugs,</p>

The original text reads: "Due to the economic downturn and the sharp drop in prices, women's clothing styles are constantly changing, and so are men's clothing styles. As a result, matured goods are outdated and no one cares about them. In order to maintain the pawnbroking industry, it is announced that starting from August 1st, the maturity period will be changed to twelve months. Upon maturity, customers who wish to retain their goods can extend the term at any time by adding interest. All goods pawned before this date will still be subject to the original regulations.

<h3 id="e120">Two Deaths by Fire on Min Guo Road Yesterday <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>At 3:10 AM yesterday morning, a fire broke out at the New Xin Laundry Company at 679 Min Guo Road in the Chinese Concession, owned by Yan Zhihua, and on the third-floor attic of the landlord Yan Le at 683 Min Guo Road, due to carelessness. At that time, the wind was strong and the fire was very fierce, spreading to 679. Police officer Yu Pengjun of post No. 7 noticed the fire and immediately reported it to the Lao Bei Men Police Station, which then reported it to the fire brigade. A fire engine rushed to the scene and extinguished the fire, which took about an hour. Two buildings were destroyed, and an unknown man and a six-year-old girl named Ling Di were burned to death on the attic of 683. Afterwards, the police took Yan Zhihua, the owner of New Xin at 679, and Yan Le, the landlord at 683, to the station for questioning. According to Yan Zhihua's statement, "I live on the upper floor of 679 Min Guo Road. I don't know the cause of the fire. I have over 1,000 yuan of fire insurance. The dead man and girl are not from my family." According to Yan Le's statement, "I am the landlord at 683. The fire started in the attic on the third floor. The tenants are Lin A'san, an old woman, and a six-year-old girl, Ling Di. But the old woman is dead. Lin A'san has rented another house elsewhere. The dead girl is Ling Di, but I don't recognize the other man." Director Shen reviewed the statements and, as the case involved a fire and two deaths, ordered it to be sent to the bureau for strict handling.</p>
<h3 id="e121">British-American Tobacco Company Executive, Harris, Drills Well at Residence, Eruption of Flames, Fire Spreads Approximately Two to Three Zhang, Injuring Two Laborers, One of Whom Has Died <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, at 12:00 noon yesterday, a well-drilling project at the residence of Harris, the executive of the British-American Tobacco Company, located at 251 Yu Ni Gan Road (new address 284-286) on the western end of Da Xi Road in the western part of Shanghai, caused a eruption of flames, injuring two laborers. The Central News Agency reporter, considering this a novel incident, made a special visit to investigate.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Harris' Residence: Yu Ni Gan Road, located on the western end of Da Xi Road, was built by the former Shanghai Municipal Council in the extraterritorial area. Although the trees planted on both sides have matured, the road surface is still earthen. Along the road, aside from a small Catholic church and the residence of Harris, the British-American Tobacco Company executive, all are farmland. Harris' residence is located on the north side of the road, covering approximately ten acres, surrounded by a short fence. A driveway winds to the house, which includes two new-style Western houses. The one in front is a two-story building, said to be occupied by Harris' daughter and son-in-law. The one in the rear is a three-story building, where Harris, approximately sixty years old, lives with his three sons. In addition, there are workshops, stables, and dog kennels, as well as a water tower. The remaining open space is maintained by a gardener, planting flowers and fruit, creating a pastoral atmosphere.</p>
<p>Well Drilling Causes Disaster: The fire-spewing well is located in the northwest corner of the residence, drilled to provide drinking water due to the inadequate water tower (there are no tap water pipes laid on this road). The well is approximately six to seven feet in diameter and five zhang deep, contracted to a foreign well-drilling company. With most of the work completed, the reporter found only three to five laborers resting, awaiting the foreman's orders. According to one of the laborers who witnessed the well explosion, the well walls are made of cement and steel reinforcement. Although spring water bubbled up from the bottom of the well, it was mixed with mud and unusable. Therefore, following the architect's instructions, several small holes were drilled in the well walls to allow water to seep into the well, preventing mud from forming. However, when laborers Wang Arong (age 18, from Shaoxing) and Li Zhifu (age 53, from Ningbo) entered the well and began working with axes, the contact of iron and stone generated sparks, which ignited a certain gas at the bottom of the well, causing an explosion. The sound was like thunder, heard by nearby farmers. Flames shot out of the well, reaching approximately two to three zhang into the sky. The thick hemp rope used for the windlass above the well was scorched, and the wood also showed signs of burning, illustrating the intensity of the fire at that moment.</p>
<p>Injured and Deceased Workers: Afterwards, the two laborers, Wang and Li, were rescued from the danger, their bodies charred black. They were immediately sent to Baolong Hospital on Buck Road for treatment. Wang Arong died from his injuries at 4:45 PM yesterday. Li Zhifu is still in critical condition and may not survive. The well owner, Harris, has ordered the work to be stopped, or perhaps the wellhead will be covered, as no one is willing to work in the well at any price.</p>

<p>At the Wu Palace establishment located at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Fujian Road around 7 PM the night before last, a young man and woman suddenly arrived and checked in. The hotel's front desk clerk assigned them room number 412 on the fourth floor. The man identified himself as Zhang Rulin, 22 years old, a local resident, and the woman as Chen Chanjuan, 20 years old, from Nanxiang. The couple behaved normally that evening and went to sleep early. However, around 3 AM yesterday morning, the tea servers on that floor suddenly heard sounds of vomiting coming from the room. The tea servers, thinking the occupants were suffering from heatstroke, approached and knocked on the door. Receiving no response after a long wait, they grew suspicious and pushed the door open. They found the man and woman lying across the bed, faces pale and unconscious. Realizing something was wrong, they immediately reported to the front desk, who in turn notified the police station. The couple was transported by car to the hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the poisoning was not severe, and they are expected to recover. It was learned that the man, Zhang Rulin, is currently employed at Lanwei Advertising Printing Company and resides at No. 1 Yihe Lane, Fangxie Road, Nanshi. He and the woman, Chen Chanjuan, are deeply in love. However, due to family obstacles, their marriage faced difficulties. Out of resentment, they attempted suicide.

<p>The Hongda Money Exchange at the intersection of Edward Road and Shandong Road regularly dispatches an employee every morning between 9 and 10 AM to various banks to exchange large sums of money into banknotes. This routine was known to bandits, who planned to rob them. On the 27th of this month, several bandits gathered to discuss their plan of action. However, their scheme was discovered by Chief Detective Su Changsheng, Detective Wu Chunrong, and Plainclothes Detective Tian Jinfu of the General Police Station. They, along with Chinese and foreign detectives, secretly laid in ambush near the exchange. Before long, the bandits Qian Kunshan (also known as Chunshan) from Zhenjiang, Chen Wanjin from Changzhou, Shen Tugeng from Shanghai, and Zhu Guozheng from Suzhou approached. The detectives rushed forward and arrested them all. A loaded pistol containing eight bullets was found on Chen Jinsheng. They were all taken back to the police station. According to their confession, Yang Yikun from Zhenjiang had provided them with information. Yang worked at the exchange. The detectives then arrested Yang and detained him as well. Yesterday, they were taken to the No. 1 Special Court, First Division. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian explained the circumstances of the arrest and requested a postponement for further investigation. Presiding Judge Feng Shide reviewed the report and briefly questioned each defendant before adjourning for further investigation.</p>

<p>Zheng Yue'en, also known as Cao Jintai, and Wei Qingchu, also known as Sanzi, both from Funing, committed multiple acts of robbery and arson in their hometown, as well as in Taizhou and Dongtai, last autumn. They fled to Shanghai. Recently, detectives from the Zhenjiang Garrison Headquarters, along with informant Zhang Dayi, arrested nine accomplices in the French Concession and handed them over to the No. 2 Special Court. Zheng and Wei were apprehended at 11:30 PM on the 26th of this month at Hankow Road and Yuanfang Road, taken to the Hongkou Police Station, and detained at the No. 1 Special District Court. Yesterday morning, Detective Hu Zhen of the garrison headquarters submitted an official letter to the Hongkou Police Station, requesting their transfer. The two were handed over to the Second Criminal Division. Municipal Council lawyer Wang Yaotang described the past events, stating that relatives (namely the informant Zhang Dayi) of the robbed residents of Funing County were present in court to identify them. They claimed that the two defendants and their accomplices had robbed the Chen family of their belongings at gunpoint last autumn and burned down seven houses, which was reported to the county government at the time. Furthermore, Detective Hu Zhen of the Zhenjiang Garrison Headquarters submitted a public notice stating that the two defendants had committed numerous crimes in Funing, Taizhou, and Dongtai, and informed the court about the transfer of the nine accomplices arrested in the French Concession. Municipal Council lawyer Wang expressed his agreement.

<p>Dai Chongli, a Ningbo fishing boat loaded with sand and gravel for sale in Shanghai, arrived at Dongpu Beach across from the Wusong Yunzaobang on the morning of the 27th of this month at 8 AM. The British Taikoo Company merchant ship "Haikou" was departing and, failing to avoid collision, struck the fishing boat amidships, causing it to sink immediately. Afterward, the sunken boat was moved by the tide and grounded near the Paotaiwan Customs Outpost (commonly known as "Huang Chuan"). The Zhanghuabang River Conservancy determined that the location was within a shipping lane used by vessels, and if the boat were not salvaged, it would obstruct the passage of ships. Consequently, the Junchupu Bureau Chief Engineer was commissioned to salvage the sunken boat. Yesterday afternoon, while the work was in progress, a diver named Yan Zhaolang, over 30 years old, from Jiangdong, Wusong, wearing a diving suit (i.e., a rubber suit), entered the water. He would work for about 50 minutes, then rest on the boat for 5 minutes before diving again. Less than 5 minutes into his second dive, the worker responsible for cranking the pump belt (which provided air) shouted because Zhaolang was not responding. The diving suit was pulled onto the deck, and the diver was found suffocated inside the rubber suit, with blood gushing from his mouth and nose. He was immediately transported to Wusong Health Hospital, but attempts to save him were unsuccessful, resulting in his tragic demise.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Zhabei Water and Electricity Company Changes Wusong Water Supply Fee Collection Method; Municipal Public Utilities Bureau Has Submitted to the Municipal Government for Approval <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The water supply in Wusong and other areas of this city has been contracted to the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company since February of this year, with the approval of the Municipal Government. Water pipes have already been laid by the company to Wusong Town. Although the town is within the city limits, the residents are relatively poor. Therefore, a revised fee collection method has been proposed to encourage water connection and achieve the goal of providing clean drinking water. The regulations stipulate that residents in the Wusong area who install 13mm and 20mm water meters will be exempt from paying the deposit. The monthly rental fee for a 13mm water meter is 20 cents (silver dollar), and for a 20mm water meter, it is 30 cents (silver dollar). Regardless of the number of houses, the water fee deposit is uniformly four dollars per household. For water meters of 25mm or larger, the regulations of the Water Sales Business Charter will still be followed. Connection fees will be calculated based on the actual cost of labor and materials according to the size of the water meter installed. If the calculated cost of labor and materials exceeds the amount stipulated in the regulations, the actual cost of labor and materials will be charged to ensure accuracy. This method has been submitted by the company to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau for approval by the Municipal Government for a two-year trial period to promote water usage.</p>

In addition to contacting Osaka and Kobe to investigate accomplices, the details of the case have not yet been determined.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctor Zhu Shuping Accused of Negligence; Two-Year-Old Child Dies, Causing Dispute; Case Concluded and Judgment Today <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Shuping, a traditional Chinese medicine pediatrician from County Kettle at No. 500 Changsha Road, treated the two-year-old child of Sun Hu's family last month. After diagnosis, he determined that the child was suffering from lingering illness after measles with dangerous symptoms. After prescribing medication, the child did not respond to the treatment and died shortly after. Sun Hu's family claimed that the death of her child was caused by the Ephedra and Aconite prescribed by Zhu, and filed a criminal complaint against Zhu Shuping for negligence. Zhu denied that the prescribed medication had any impropriety and filed a counterclaim against Sun Hu's family for false accusation. The First Special District Court summoned the parties and, with the consent of both parties, sent the prescription to the Traditional Chinese Medicine Association for expert evaluation, as previously reported. Yesterday afternoon was the date for the continued hearing of the case. Judge Liu Yugui first distributed the evaluation report from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Association to the lawyers for both parties for review. The lawyer for the plaintiff, Shen Yong, stated that he could not trust the evaluation report because the Traditional Chinese Medicine Association was a professional organization, and requested that the prescription be re-evaluated by an academic organization to ensure fairness. The defendant's defense lawyer, Zhang Enhao, objected, stating that the previous decision to have the Traditional Chinese Medicine Association perform the evaluation was agreed upon by both parties, so why change the decision now? Furthermore, Shen was already a member of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Association and its legal advisor, and should not have contempt for or distrust the official organization and the report it had produced after deliberation. At that time, lawyer Shen presented a medical book, stating that it could prove the defendant's improper use of medicine. The court then questioned the defendant, Zhu Shuping, who stated that both Ephedra and Aconite were effective in opening the lungs and treating lingering illness after measles, and that the other medicines either helped to resolve phlegm or had the effect of strengthening the foundation. In short, all the medicines in the prescription were related, and treatment should not rely entirely on medical books. Furthermore, the child's illness was very severe, and he had told the people holding the child and so on. Next, the plaintiff, Sun Hu's family, stated that the child's illness was quite mild that day, so they only asked the wet nurse to take the child. If the illness had been serious, even if they did not invite a doctor to the house, they would have taken the child themselves. However, the child died that night after taking the medicine, so they were certain that the death was due to the wrong medication. At the end, after mutual debate between the lawyers for the two parties, Judge Liu ordered the parties to wait for the pronouncement (today) in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Wang Boqun, the former Minister of Transportation of the National Government and currently a Central Committee member, commissioned the Xinfengji Construction Company at No. 381 Huade Road to contract the entire construction project of a residence at No. 31, Lane 1136, Yuyuan Road in June 1931. However, the artificial stone part of the project was contracted to Lixing Foreign Company, Le Praleson. Due to difficulties in receiving payment, work was once stopped. In December 1932, the project was resumed and completed. It was agreed that all wages would be paid by the homeowner and that Xielong engineers would issue two payment certificates totaling 2,392.585 silver dollars. However, the money has not been paid to date, and repeated requests have been ineffective. Le Praleson hired lawyer Ge Zhaoji to file a claim in the civil division of the First Special District Court against Xinfengji Construction Company and Wang Boqun, requesting a judgment ordering the repayment of 2,392.585 silver dollars to the plaintiff, plus overdue interest at 2% per annum, and the payment of litigation costs. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Hong opened Civil Division 6 and summoned Wang Boqun's lawyer to court to raise a jurisdictional issue, stating that Wang's residence was located on a road built beyond the concession boundaries and should be under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai District Court. However, the plaintiff's lawyer argued that although Wang's residence was located on a road built beyond the concession boundaries, Xinfengji was located in the Public Concession, so the court had jurisdiction. Judge Shen adjourned the case for a continued hearing.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 26th of this month, the Zhabei Xinzha Detective Squad Leader Bao Ziying received a tip that kidnapping bandits named Xiao Lusong and Xiao Maohan were hiding in the Lujiabang area of Nanshi, and that they may have conspired with Xiang Yi, the owner of the sand casting factory on Hongnan Road in Zhabei. The squad determined that Xiao Lusong had indeed committed a kidnapping case, so Squad Leader Bao reported to Bureau Chief Ruan. That afternoon around 7 PM, he dispatched the head and deputy leaders Dong Wenrui and Liu Changpei, and detectives Fang Chao fu, Mao Gongzhao, Zang Lu, Sun Youzhi, Zhang Shuwen, and Yin Ruifu in disguise, along with police officers Zhou Qingxuan and others from the local patrol police station, to go to the address. At the Laohuzao (stove) at No. 2, Lane 75, Shangyuan Street, Lujiabang, they arrested Xiao Lusong and three suspects. After interrogation, Xiao Lusong, who changed his name to Wu Miaoshuang (i.e., Xiao Lusong), 32 years old, from Tongzhou, with no fixed address, admitted that he had kidnapped a young master surnamed Wu in the Shangwenmen area of Xiaoximen five years ago in May. His accomplices at the time were Lu Liangguang, Jiang Laohu, Pan Fayin, etc. After the victim was kidnapped, Lu Jianglin and others hid him on a boat under Zhoujia Bridge in the old harbor. Later, they negotiated the ransom on the Bund on the Great Road and received a total of 15,000 silver dollars. Lu Liangguang gave him 500 silver dollars at the Huizhong Hotel to spend, which was true. He did not know about the current kidnapping case and said that he could ask Xiao Maohan. Xiao Maohan currently lived at No. 41 Caoxiewan, Lujiabang. Pan Fayin was currently facing charges and was arrested in Tongzhou last March by inspector Zhang Qing tang. After receiving the confession, the squad dispatched the original detective team to No. 41 Caoxiewan, Lujiabang, and arrested Xiao Maohan and brought him back to the case. Xiao Maohan, whose current name was Zhu Baosheng (i.e., Xiao Maohan), 45 years old, from Tongzhou, stated that three years ago, Lu Liangguang had asked him to fight someone behind the slaughterhouse. He was arrested by the police and served two years in prison. After being released from prison, he had a dispute with Lu Liangguang. At that time, Lu Liangguang had kidnapped a victim and gave him 500 yuan of ocean money to compensate. Wu Miaoshuang knew that he had obtained this money, so he dragged him out today. He did not know about the current kidnapping case. There were three other people: Yu Shunji, 31 years old, from Nantong, living in Lane 75, Shangyuan Street, Xiaonanmen; Jiang Daxing, 23 years old, from Haimen, living in Xinqiao area, Hongqiao Town. Both of them claimed that they were having tea at the Laohuzao when they were mistakenly arrested. The third was Lu Miaolin, also from Tongzhou, living at No. 28, Lianhua Lane, Lujiabang. He stated that he and Lu Liangguang were cousins, but they did not interact, so he did not know what they were doing. He did not expect that when they caught him, they would bring him here. After reviewing the statements, the questioner considered the case to be significant and requiring further investigation.</p>

<p>Sheng Zecheng, a descendant of the late Qing Dynasty grand guardian Sheng, was sued by Xue Wanhuan and Zhang Changgen from Yancheng through a lawyer for criminal self-prosecution of damaging graves at the First Special District Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the hearing at Criminal Division 3. According to the plaintiffs, Xue and Zhang, there was a mound of earth on Meibaige Road. Recently, Sheng Zecheng hired someone to transport the coffins on the grave site, remove the fence, and intended to build houses. They were directors of the township association for the gravesite. The lawyer for the self-prosecuting plaintiffs stated that the gravesite had been the subject of civil litigation in 1932, and the result was that the land was ruled to be managed by the association and could not be sold. The case file number was 1457, and the court was requested to access the file to clarify the matter. The defendant did not appear, nor was there a lawyer representing him. An investigation found that there was no person named Sheng Zecheng at No. 526 Jing'an Temple Road, so the summons was returned. Judge Jiang ruled that the case would be adjourned for seven days, and the self-prosecuting plaintiffs were ordered to direct the summons for further review.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Another Woman Sues Ruan Kaiji for Illegal Detention and Obstruction of Freedom <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Ruan Kaiji, the former chief of the Xinzha Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, who had already been suspended from his position, along with bureau members Zheng Zuhan and others, jointly filed a lawsuit in the local court accusing him of dereliction of duty, etc. The court held several trials, and the result was that the accusations made by Zheng and others lacked sufficient evidence, and a decision was made not to prosecute. Unexpectedly, recently, another woman, Tu Xu Shi, sued Ruan Kaiji in the local court for illegal arrest and abuse of power, as well as Jiang Weiyu for false accusation. The details of the case and the court hearing are recorded below. It is said that a local man named Tu Axiang, who lives at No. 1446 Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, is a standing director of the municipal cattle slaughtering industry union. At the end of last month, a small number of workers in Jiang Weiyu's Jiangxiangxing cattle slaughtering workshop went on strike. When the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs was mediating impartially, Jiang Weiyu believed that the striking workers were instigated by Tu Axiang, so he reported to the Xinzha Branch and sent police to summon Tu Axiang without success. Therefore, Tu's wife, Tu Xu Shi, was detained at the bureau. The next day, she was sent to the Public Security Bureau and released. Three of the striking workers were detained by the branch and sent to the local court. After the prosecutor's interrogation, they were also given a decision not to prosecute. Now, Tu Xu Shi has hired lawyer Lu Qi to file a direct complaint with the criminal court of the local court, accusing Jiang Weiyu of false accusation and colluding with Ruan Kaiji, the chief of the Xinzha Branch, to illegally detain her and obstruct her freedom, requesting a thorough investigation. After the court received the complaint, Judge Tan Zhuohong specially opened the tenth court at 10:00 AM yesterday to hear the case. The plaintiff, Tu Xu Shi, and her lawyer Lu Qi arrived in court successively. The defendants, Jiang Weiyu and Ruan Kaiji, also hired lawyers Fan Gang and Zhang Fukang to appear in court and defend them. First, Tu Xu Shi testified that she was 31 years old, from Qingpu. On the first day of this month, at about 4:00 PM, Jiang Weiyu led the police to her house and asked if her husband, Tu Axiang, was at home. She replied that her husband had left for Suzhou a few days ago due to some business. Jiang and others did not believe her and went into the bedroom to search. Because there was no trace of her husband, Jiang and others ordered her to go to the police station with them. She said that she had many children at home and no one to take care of them for the time being, and even if she went, the police station would have to make arrangements in advance. Unexpectedly, Jiang and others ignored the situation and slapped her repeatedly, handcuffed her with Western-style handcuffs, and dragged her to the police station for detention. When she said this, she could not help but shed tears. The judge ordered the defendant Jiang Weiyu to the stand, who stated that he was 27 years old, a local, and lived at No. 687 Jiaotong Road. The judge asked her how she would defend herself against the charge of obstructing freedom. Jiang replied that after the strike occurred in his shop on July 1, the striking workers said that it was Tu Axiang who instigated them. He immediately reported to the police station, and the police station ordered him to point out Tu Axiang and bring two policemen with him. The judge asked why Tu Xu Shi was detained. Jiang replied that he did not know, but at that time, Tu Axiang was out, and she voluntarily went to the police station. Tu Xu Shi said sternly that they used coercive means to arrest her. She was eating dinner, and they beat her and searched her husband in her house. She told them that her husband had gone to Suzhou. She went to the room to change her shoes, and they said she was going to escape. They kicked her and beat her, and because she refused to go, they handcuffed her. Lawyer Lu Qi stated that Ruan Kaiji had not arrived today. Did the court's summons receive? The judge then turned to lawyer Fan Gang and said that Ruan Kaiji must comply with the summons and appear in court next time. Lawyer Fan agreed. Lawyer Lu Qi added that the Central Government, the Central Party Department, the Control Yuan, the Municipal Government, and other agencies were paying attention to this case and thoroughly investigating it. The judge then adjourned the court for further joint trial.</p>

<p>Zhao Jishan, a native of Zhenjiang, who lives at No. 71 Xinkangli, Kangnuo Road, and is a Chinese medicine practitioner at Guangyi Hospital on Roberts Road, is 32 years old this year. He married Leng (34 years old this year), a woman from the same village, seven years ago. Because she did not bear any children, Zhao also took his sister-in-law's younger sister, Zhong Zhendi (25 years old this year), as a concubine. They lived together for five years and had a daughter. Because the wife and concubine lived together, they often quarreled, causing Leng to be intolerable to the concubine. Zhao, harboring evil intentions, on the afternoon of the 4th of this month, ostensibly took his wife, Leng, to the Great World for entertainment. At 7:30 PM, Zhao lured Leng to the fifth floor of the amusement park, along the roof platform facing the Edward Road side near the dance stage, and pretended to say to Leng, "Let's hug each other to test each other's weight." First, Leng lifted Zhao up. After putting him down, Zhao lifted Leng up and threw her over the railing, trying to kill her. Fortunately, Leng grabbed the railing in fright and shouted for help. A waiter named Zhu Jinfu rushed to rescue her and sent her and Zhao to the cashier, who handed them over to the patrolman and sent them to the French Concession Police Station. Investigator Ma Yizhi was dispatched to investigate and escorted Zhao to the Special No. 2 Court. The police legal advisor filed a public prosecution according to Article 276 of the new criminal law for attempted murder. Judge Li Changnian held several hearings to investigate the details, which have been recorded in this newspaper. The trial of this case has now concluded. At the beginning of the verdict yesterday, at 9:00 AM, Judge Li came to the first criminal court and ordered the defendant Zhao Jishan to be brought to the stand. After briefly questioning his age and origin, he announced the verdict: Zhao Jishan was sentenced to five years of imprisonment for attempted murder. The number of days of detention before the judgment is finalized will be counted as one day of imprisonment. During the appeal period, he was ordered to be transferred to the detention center for further instructions. It is said that the defendant expressed dissatisfaction with the verdict and intended to appeal.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Guangzhou Municipal Middle Schools to Implement Coeducation Separation <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>To be Implemented Starting This Academic Year</p>
<p>Designated Municipal No. 2 Middle School to Enroll All Female Students</p>
<p>Guangzhou Municipal Elementary and Secondary Schools have always been coeducational. Recently, in order to improve the efficiency of education and enable male and female students to concentrate on their studies, the Municipal Bureau of Education proposed that municipal middle schools separate male and female students for instruction. This was discussed at the 158th Municipal Administrative Meeting and immediately resolved to implement coeducation separation, with the names remaining the same. Municipal No. 1 Middle School and No. 3 Middle School were designated to enroll only male students, and Municipal No. 2 Middle School was designated to enroll only female students. No. 1 and No. 2 Middle Schools each reduced one senior and junior high school class, while No. 3 Middle School increased two senior and junior high school classes. Teachers' salaries and benefits were standardized, with senior high school teachers receiving eight yuan per hour and junior high school teachers receiving six yuan. The budgets of each school were based on the principle of not exceeding the total budget for this year. The implementation was scheduled to begin in the autumn of this year (the 24th year of the Republic). According to recent investigations, after the case was passed, municipal middle schools have begun preparations, and the number of classes in each school has changed. The reason is that the Second Middle School has a total of 13 classes of male and female students, and now it completely accepts 11 classes of female students. The First Municipal Middle School originally had 20 classes of male and female students, but now it has reduced two classes to 18 classes. The Third Municipal Middle School originally had 4 classes of male and female students, and now it has increased four classes to 8 classes. Although the number of classes in the three schools may increase or decrease this time, they actually offset each other, but the original budgets of each school need to be slightly modified, but there is no increase in municipal expenditure.</p>
<p>As for municipal elementary schools, they are still coeducational. The Municipal Bureau of Education recently received a subsidy of 50,000 yuan from the central government, which will be used to expand short-term compulsory elementary schools starting this year in order to accommodate out-of-school children in the city. Private schools in the city are still strictly prohibited, and those with good results will be subsidized according to their grades, while those that have not improved will be ordered to disband. In addition, the Bureau of Education recently selected one or two elementary schools in the city to test the new four-year system. It is reported that the results are quite good, and it will be designed to promote this four-year elementary school system in the autumn. (July 28)</p>

The battle against Jingwu the night before last can also be described as a grand occasion. Langya's defeat last night was entirely due to the slackness of the first two groups.

Tomorrow night they will face the United Cup champion Post Office Team. The day after tomorrow (August 2nd) they will battle the Shanghai United Team, still to be held at the Central Auditorium (originally scheduled for the Japanese Club due to the small address).

<p>The Guangdong swimming team's trip to Hangzhou, led by team leader Li Rixin, took the Zha Jing intermodal train to Hangzhou last Saturday and returned to Shanghai with honors yesterday morning. The harvest from this trip was richer than the last time the China Youth team went to Hangzhou. On the 28th, in the confrontation with Changfeng, all programs, totaling eight items, except for the 50-meter freestyle and 400-meter freestyle, which did not break the Zhejiang provincial record, the remaining six items broke the provincial record in four items and created new records in two items. All first and second places were taken by the Guangdong team, and the most valuable achievement was Huang Rixiong's 100-meter backstroke, with a score of 1 minute 24 seconds, approaching the national record held by Liu Shixi in the preliminary selections of the 10th Far Eastern Games, shortening it by 6 seconds compared to Zhou Ruiqin's 1 minute 30 seconds the last time the China Youth team went to Hangzhou. His 100-meter freestyle was also created by Huang Rixiong, with a score of 1 minute 14.3 seconds, also better than Zhang Rongguang's 1 minute 17 seconds the last time the China Youth team went to Hangzhou. Although other items broke the Zhejiang provincial record, the scores were less than those achieved by the China Youth team in Hangzhou. The full results are recorded below:</p>
<p>Fujian Province's Plans for Physical Education and Reflections on Returning from a Southern Tour Wu Yunrui, Wu Cheng, Cheng Dengke</p>
<p>Zheng Xinnan, Director of the Education Department of Fujian Province, is a famous contemporary scientist. Since taking charge of education in Fujian Province, his achievements have been remarkable. Mr. Zheng has a grand vision of saving the country through science, so in recent years he has spent 50,000 to 60,000 yuan to establish an extremely well-equipped science museum in the center of the provincial capital, so that public and private primary schools in the provincial capital can use it nearby without having to prepare their own scientific instruments. The savings in expenses are self-evident. The classrooms, student laboratories, and specialized research rooms are all fully equipped. Recently, the scientific equipment in the provincial capital has been extended to the entire province, and it has been clearly stipulated that the last year was Science Year, supplementing the expenses of each school to set up scientific instruments. In the past year, it has already taken shape. Director Zheng also sees the weakness of the people of Fujian Province and the importance of national physical education, so in addition to scientific equipment, physical education equipment should be expanded to build a foundation for promoting school physical education. Therefore, he resolutely designated the 24th year as Physical Education Year, hired Wu Demao, a lecturer in the Physical Education Department of Central University, as a consultant to the provincial government and a physical education supervisor, and together with Tang Yichong, the third section chief, held summer workshops for primary and secondary schools, with a physical education group set up inside, ordering primary and secondary school teachers and social education institutions to send personnel to attend lectures, and inviting Fang Wanbang, a physical educationist from the province, to return to Fujian to lecture. Because Fang could not stay in Fujian for the entire period, he invited colleagues to assist him. This is the reason for the colleagues' trip to Fujian.</p>
<p>The physical education group had 96 male and female students. All the subjects were quite practical. Taking advantage of the colleagues' presence in Fujian, Director Zheng also gathered the principals of secondary schools throughout the province to hold a physical education discussion meeting. In order to promote the advancement of physical education throughout the province, he gathered the principals of public and private schools throughout the province in one hall and held a specialized meeting. This is truly a pioneering effort for physical education colleagues to join hands with middle school principals. At this meeting, it was stipulated that 1% to 3% of the total school expenses should be used for physical education expenses. The sports fees paid by students must be kept independent and not be misappropriated. The principal must submit it to the Education Department for approval before it can be used. In this physical education year, each school must have the minimum physical education equipment ready, and the physical education supervisor will inspect and assess them and give praise or criticism. Director Zheng also deeply knows that to promote physical education, the education of talent must be given priority, so it was decided to open a physical education normal class at Fuzhou Normal School starting in the 24th year, in order to train leading talent and make a foundation for promoting physical education throughout the province. The establishment of a physical education department in a provincial normal school is unprecedented except for Hebei Province. The above are all good results of this meeting.</p>
<p>In addition to the 7th Division, the Fuzhou garrison also has a military police regiment. Soldiers are often seen doing freehand exercises on the sports field and playing ball games, adding a lot of color to the sports field. Ji Zhangjian, the head of the military police regiment, has achieved excellent results in Fujian and is deeply loved by the people, and he is very supportive of physical education. He often personally takes the lead as a model for the soldiers, ordering physical education instructor Wu Zibin to hold various ball game round-robin competitions and regimental sports meets in each team under the regiment's jurisdiction. According to Regiment Head Ji, a large-scale military and police sports meet will be held soon to promote physical education.</p>
<p>Hot springs are a specialty of Fuzhou, and bathhouses are everywhere. The attention to detail can be said to be the best in the country. It is also heard that the provincial capital plans to set up a large-scale hot spring swimming pool jointly run by the government and businesses to cultivate the people's ability to engage in water activities. The design drawings for this swimming pool have already been drawn by engineers and will be started as soon as funding is available.</p>
<p>Director Zheng not only pays attention to school physical education but also to social physical education. In this physical education year, he will also promote it at the same time, ordering each county to improve the existing sports fields and add new sports fields if they do not have them. Whether it is in politics, academics, or work, if there are certain steps and annual plans, nothing will not be successful. After a two-week tour of Fujian, the colleagues had this very good impression and were deeply pleased for the future of physical education in Fujian Province. The following is a general summary of the thoughts on the tour of Fujian:</p>
<p>(1) The physical education community will be united from now on. Lin Yin'nan, a physical education instructor in Fujian Province, is a veteran of the physical education community. Fujian's physical education has what it has today thanks to Lin's efforts. Now knowing the importance of the tasks in the Physical Education Year, it is definitely not something that the strength of a few people can do, so he takes a leading position and advocates a grand alliance of the physical education community, eliminating personal prejudices and academic factional disputes, and jointly planning the advancement of physical education in Fujian Province to achieve the heavenly duty of revitalizing the nation. His correctness of vision is admired by the colleagues. From now on, the progress of physical education in Fujian Province will be due to Lin's call to awaken the confused dream.</p>
<p>(2) The students' focus on research in Fujian Province for several weeks, just in time for the hot summer, and each student has five hours of academic subjects every morning and two or three hours of technical subjects in the afternoon. Sometimes there are discussion meetings at night, and each student is eager to learn, asking questions when they have doubts. This scale of eagerness to learn is truly admirable. The colleagues are ashamed of their shallow learning, and in this situation, they cannot help but try to make it difficult. Pursuing memories along the way still has some joy. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— (Xu Jiawu)</p>
<p>Time passes by in a clickety-clack manner, and people advance like oxen in the process of conquering nature.</p>
<p>Space-time is the warp and weft of the universe; however, without people, who use different perceptions and energies in different environments to think and create, how could space-time, however great, weave into a pattern of different colors that hangs forever?</p>
<p>"An inch of time is an inch of gold, but an inch of gold cannot buy an inch of time." Clever and skillful socializers, after eating their fill, interpret the saying literally, holding a fiftieth-plus-one birthday celebration today, and a sixtieth birthday celebration tomorrow, as if the continuation of life and the accumulation of time are something worth boasting about and rejoicing in!</p>
<p>"Young in age, inexperienced in the world"; "Hair already white, why not die sooner?" Originally ephemeral beings in space-time, how many ambitions and achievements are lost in this traditional, passive view of age!</p>
<h3 id="e164">Mr. Chun <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Yafei</p>
<p>Mr. Chun was a scholar who passed the imperial examination in the Qing Dynasty. Not long ago, he was admired by many people, but now he has retired to the countryside, making a living as a doctor. He no longer advises on any current affairs, as if he wants to escape from the world and leisurely spend his old age.</p>
<p>Recently, he has become somewhat disgusted with the world, because the world has given him a bad impression; therefore, he feels somewhat sad about everything now. However, what makes him most angry is the behavior of his son and daughter, which is completely out of line.</p>
<p>"Oh! I was too foolish, I regret sending them to those foreign schools; now they have become neither male nor female, what are they like! Young girls can go out all day long to flirt with boyfriends, and young men don't want to work all day long, but take women to the cinema and dance hall to talk about love; it's a disgrace, alas! This world..." Thinking of this, he almost burst into flames: "It's absurd that a father can't control his children!"</p>
<p>Indeed, Mr. Chun is a descendant of a family of scholars, how can he compare himself with ordinary families without thresholds? Now his son and daughter dare to disobey his family education and go out to socialize like crazy, isn't this deliberately messing with him? It really made his yellow beard stand up in anger.</p>
<p>"Ah! It's rebellious, it's rebellious, the world has been brought to this point, men and women are indistinguishable, how can it be! And even the father can't control the children anymore. What's with not even saying hello to the father when they see him, and asking for money as soon as they meet, and clamoring for a family revolution if they don't get it; okay, from tomorrow on, they won't be allowed to enter the house, and I'll publish a notice disowning them." He paced around the study in circles, muttering to himself, and when he said he would publish a notice disowning them, he hit the table with his fist, as if it added a lot of courage to him.</p>
<p>Feeling a little tired, he sat down on a rocking chair by the window, picked up a small teapot, and took a sip of ginseng tea, as if it calmed the anger in his chest.</p>
<p>Although he just said that he would publish a notice disowning them, now that he thought about it calmly, it wasn't right. This would not only make relatives and friends laugh; moreover, my Qin family only has that one line of descent, "There are three forms of unfilial piety, the worst is to have no descendants," no, I should still teach them well! Thinking like this, all anger subsided.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Conservative <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Wan</p>
<p>If only Englishmen are the most conservative people in the world, then Mr. Ji Mu is the epitome of an Englishman. He is a playboy, but he is different from other playboys, he is an old playboy who is almost sixty years old, his different places are: ordinary playboys, mostly like the new and hate the old, ambitious, he is not; he does not dislike the old, especially does not like the new, more afraid of people talking about ambitious problems; he is suspicious of, curses, criticizes, and ridicules all new things, unless they are newly minted silver coins, newly printed banknotes, he cannot not use them. The house he lives in is in a very old alley, and the insurance period of the house has exceeded ten years ago. Because he wants to preserve his vitality, he not only does not take a bath all year round, but even his feet are rarely washed once or twice, he refuses to cut his nails when they grow long, his teeth are loose, and he even refuses to ask a dentist to pull them out, saying that he wants to preserve the remains of his parents, he eats Fujian Golden Lion brand skin silk cigarettes, and has not changed the brand for thirty years, he also smokes Old Beauty cigars, also thirty years as one day, his bedroom corner is piled up with empty cigar boxes, reaching the ceiling, and he never wants to abandon them. On his table, there is a broken Shenbao newspaper from fifteen years ago as a cushion, he eats one bowl for lunch and two bowls for dinner every day, even if he is not full, or can't eat it, he never wants to add or subtract a mouthful. He has a monk's cap brand cigarette box from twenty-nine years ago on his cupboard, an old satin cap from forty years ago, a bamboo ear pick from ten years ago, and... years ago... In short, entering his house is like entering a museum of antiques.</p>

<p>— Princess Der Ling, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Such compassionate actions, though not uncommon in our Chinese history, and among the monarchs of past dynasties, there was no lack of those who loved their people like children; but whether His Oldness created this idea himself, or whether he intentionally emulated the ancients, it can always be considered admirable.</p>
<p>Because I knew of such an incident, I firmly believe that she was a kind-hearted old lady, and she must have been mindful of the traitor's past merits and his family, and could not decisively determine the punishment he should receive.</p>
<p>When it comes to punishment, the most severe is naturally beheading or hanging! The next most severe is for the imperial court to issue an edict instructing him to commit suicide by taking medicine, or by slitting his throat, or by hanging himself. According to the current crimes of this Guangdong governor, beheading and hanging are certainly too cruel; a more appropriate punishment would be to order him to commit suicide. However, the Empress Dowager still felt unbearable in her heart, so should he just be let off? No; no, although the Empress Dowager was compassionate, she would not deliberately favor him and lose the meaning of impartiality; thus, the following memorial was issued by the Grand Council the next day. Within a few days, all of China knew about this matter.</p>
<p>"By imperial decree: The Guangdong Governor ×× is corrupt and perverts the law, and his reputation is tarnished. The former Minister of the Ministry of Revenue ×× and the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Justice ×× were sent to investigate. According to the report, the investigation is true, and he should be dismissed immediately and sent to Heilongjiang, never to be employed again; his property should also be seized by the Jiangsu Province (because the hometown of the offending governor is in Suzhou) Governor ×× and ordered by the local officials to be sealed and confiscated. Respect this."</p>
<p>This punishment seems to be very light, and all of this happened more than thirty years ago, but its impact has not diminished to this day. (378)</p>

<p>Cat Taboos Two Rules (1) A pregnant cat, if it eats too many chicken bones, the fetus will vanish. (2) When a kitten is first born, within three days, a person born in the Year of the Tiger (i.e., born in the year of Yin) must not look at it, or the mother cat will certainly eat its young. This is an old wives' tale, and it has been proven to be true, but the reason for it is incomprehensible.</p>

<p>Chapter Seventeen: Do Not Ask a Daughter's Body Difficult to Say Hidden Pain Contend to See Noble Person's Face Commonly Admire Noble Demeanor</p>
<p>So on the surface, Zhang Jiefu would not help anymore, he was not responsible. Fortunately, he was here, still staying for one night, maybe if he tried to get around him again, he could get some benefit from him. Huanhua was lost in thought, dazed for a while. Accidentally turning his head, he saw Cheng Zhiqian smiling at him through the glass window. He nodded and said: Mr. Cheng did not go out today. Zhiqian casually replied that he did not go out. After saying this, he thought to himself, people are feeling distressed, why be so cold to them. So he nodded and smiled: Congratulations, you can go back to Jiangnan now. He replied: Alas! There is no reason to congratulate. It's like a prisoner who is about to leave the prison gate. But after leaving the prison gate, what will happen, he doesn't know at all, maybe in just three days, I will starve to death. As he spoke, he walked towards the room. Zhiqian chatted with him for a long time, since people had already come in, there was no reason to push them out, so he smiled and said: Please sit down. Separated from the capital, going south again, who knows if we will ever meet again. Huanhua did not expect Zhiqian to express such goodwill, if he used good words to talk to him, maybe he could lend a helping hand, so he smiled and said: You see, like that Miss Zhu from Gansu who fled the famine, she will marry Mr. Jia as a concubine, isn't this human life's joys, sorrows, partings and reunions, all difficult to say? Zhiqian smiled and said: Miss Yang thinks that Miss Zhu is very proud? Huanhua paused in his speech, unable to answer, because Zhiqian had already poured a cup of tea and placed it in front of him, so he picked up the teacup and took a sip. (278)</p>

<h3 id="e171">The World's Biggest Fat Man <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>Robert Ruggendorf, Germany's only fat man, recently died in Rossburg. His body weighed 539 pounds, and he made a living by publicly displaying his fat figure. When he went on trips, he could only ride in freight trains, because the doors of passenger cars were too small to allow him to enter and exit, so he had a specially prepared motorcycle that could accommodate his mountain of flesh for long journeys. The front door of the house he lived in was specially enlarged, more than twice the size of his neighbors' doors, so one can imagine how fat he was.</p>
<p>However, Ruggendorf, although fat, was not as fat as the Englishman Edward Bright, who, at the time of his death, weighed 616 pounds, with a circumference of five feet six inches, a chest circumference of six feet eleven inches, and a mid-arm circumference of one foot six inches. He did not exhibit himself to people, but made a living by selling groceries, and eventually died at the age of thirty because his body became fatter and fatter every day. After he died, someone in Maldon bet that five men of twenty-one could be wrapped in his sleeve, but the result was that ten people could be wrapped in it, and the sleeve was still stiff. Bright was survived by a wife and five children. He was very cheerful in nature, and his appetite was not that much larger than that of ordinary people, but in the years before his death, he drank a gallon of beer every day. After his death, the coffin could not be carried out of the door, so the wall had to be opened before it could be carried out.</p>
<p>The two people above were fat, but there was also the world's biggest fat man, whose name was Daniel Lambert, who weighed 739 pounds a few days before his death, with a waist circumference of nine feet four inches, and a leg circumference of thirty-seven inches. Each time he had a suit made, the tailor charged a huge sum of twenty gold pounds. He was born in Leicester, England, and was as strong as an ox, easily lifting 600 pounds. Once, a large circus bear bullied a dog on the street, he took great offense and fought with the bear, eventually defeating it and letting the dog go. Lambert was also a very skilled swimmer in his youth, his large body floating high on the water, his back able to accommodate two strong men standing on it, as if standing on a raft.</p>
<p>Lambert's father was not fat, his figure was about average, he was a jailer in the Leicester prison. When he retired in his old age, Lambert continued to serve as a jailer. His heart was as big as his body, so he treated the prisoners with particular kindness, never mistreating them. Later, because of his diligent service, he rose step by step, eventually rising to the position of warden, and when he retired, the government gave him a generous pension. Only because he was too fat, wherever he went, many people would surround him to look at him, so after he retired, he had nothing to do, so he simply made a public exhibition of himself. Although he did not make a living from this, rather than being confined to his own home, why not go out and make money with his fat body? He lived in Piccadilly, where he was exhibited, his style was very grand, everything was very particular, and important figures of the time often went to see him, which made his value even higher. For several years, his exhibition business was very prosperous, and he earned a lot of money. Later, he died in the town of Stamford in Lincolnshire, but he still holds the highest record for the world's fattest man.</p>
<p>Bright died at the age of thirty, Lambert at the age of forty, and the recent Ruggendorf died at the age of forty-seven, so it can be seen that being fat is indeed a disease, and fat people often cannot enjoy old age.</p>

The exchange rate gradually stabilized, and buyers gradually became active and increased in price. Rumors continued to rise, and it broke through the 900 yuan mark again. Many parties took advantage of the high prices to exit again, which easily led to a decline. It was predicted that Indian silver would fall by one anna, which had little impact.

<h3 id="e175">Chinese Banks Vigorously Sell Off, Foreign Exchange is Tight Both Overtly and Covertly <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign電, London large bills recently contracted by 0.1875, far contracts by 0.25, the New York silver market remained unchanged, the forward silver price in Montreux contracted by 0.1 to 0.4 cents, London spot gold rose by one and a half pence, the pound against the dollar contracted by 0.125, the pound against the franc did not move, the dollar against the pound contracted by 0.375, the dollar against the franc increased by 0.25, morale recovered, the exchange rate opened in the morning with the near-term selling price of sterling at one shilling and six pence, and the US dollar at 37.1875 yuan, which was 0.0625 tighter for sterling and 0.1875 tighter for the US dollar compared to the previous close. The Central Bank's listing was announced, with the UK contracting by half a penny, the US contracting by 1.0625 yuan, and the customs gold unit soaring by 4.8 cents. The trend remained tight after opening, but later, commercial banks such as Continental National Products had strong selling pressure, and the banks' appetite also exceeded supply, and the process of turning loose was quite fast. It was predicted that HSBC's listing would show a contraction of 0.25 in the UK and a contraction of 5.625 in the US. Foreign banks maintained the low prices, and there was slight struggle, but the Bank of Japan Mitsui and the Chinese Bank Continental continued to sell off, and the supply exceeded demand. The process was once surprisingly tight, but Western commercial banks slightly closed positions at the low prices, which was still sustainable. When the selling pressure stopped, the process also flattened, and Da Tong and others closed positions, and the process gradually tightened. It was predicted that Indian silver would contract by one anna, and the overall situation at noon was hovering, and the post-market was flat. Continental still had selling, but because morale recovered and the banks' willingness to take positions was still strong, the process gradually tightened. There were many fluctuations in the middle, and the situation was less impressive than the gold market. The contraction of Indian silver by one anna also lacked impact. Later, the Hong Kong market loosened, and there was fear of positions, and the domestic market also turned firm. The closing price for the near-term selling price was one shilling and six pence for sterling and 37.1875 yuan for the US dollar, which was 0.0625 tighter for sterling and 0.1875 tighter for the US dollar compared to the previous close. Chinese merchants closed positions for a small number of shillings, but about 300,000 US dollars. Chinese commercial banks Continental National Products sold off, foreign commercial banks closed positions slightly, and the day's transactions are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Financial Market Conditions Gradually Improve - Call Loan Interest Rate Still at One Dime ...

<p>Although yesterday was still one day away from the end of the month, all banks were handling affairs in advance to consolidate credit. Therefore, market conditions remained intricate. However, call loan interest rates remained at two cents in both the morning and afternoon. There was no improvement in overdrafting with insufficient funds, indicating some availability in capital. Conditions had improved over the previous month. Transactions in discounted paper totaled over 2.8 million yuan in the morning session, and over 300,000 in new trades. The afternoon session saw over 200,000 in discounted paper transactions. The small clearing house saw over 600,000 yuan in trading.

<h3 id="e177">Surge in Securities and Public Bonds to Tax and Supervision Interest <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Business Securities Exchange began trading September futures. Before the market opened, the sentiment was extremely firm and bullish, with a strong potential for limit-up surges. Rumors of currency inflation were widespread, and the prices of cotton yarn and raw cotton had already soared, making investors particularly speculative. Unexpectedly, large institutional investors suddenly sold off substantial amounts, creating a contradiction between initial bullishness and later bearishness. Market sentiment was dampened and prices eased. However, most gains were considered excessive, and a correction was inevitable. Amidst the devaluation of currency and the noise surrounding inflation, fluctuations are expected. Investigations reveal that most financial institutions had already disposed of their inventories, leaving no large amounts for sale. Retail investors generally preferred holding cash in banks. If the environment and news remain unchanged, prices will likely rebound after a slight dip, continuing the abnormal development. Currently, most bond prices remain below 70% of their face value. Yesterday's trading was extremely chaotic. At the open, the "Compilation and Dispatch" bonds rose by nearly one yuan, and the "Troop Reduction" bonds rose by about two yuan. Later, the upward momentum gradually weakened, and the surge stopped at "Tax and Supervision" bonds. Sellers, such as those holding bonds numbered 4, 14, and 21, actively sold, causing subsequent prices to fall by a few cents. Investor sentiment shifted with the trend, and the second session saw a uniform decline. "Troop Reduction" bonds plummeted by 1.4 yuan. The downward trend stabilized somewhat but did not stop entirely. Therefore, the second session's prices were uniformly lower than the opening prices. Overall, the results showed that earlier bonds performed better, rising by 12 cents to 85 cents, while later bonds declined by 2 cents to 8 cents. The total trading volume was 29,521,000 yuan. The price changes are summarized in the table below (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>The July term "Golden Rooster" brand cotton yarn was launched on January 8th of this year, with the yarn price at 189.50 yuan. Subsequently, due to disappointing yarn sales, tight credit, and a major crisis in banks and money shops, bankruptcies were frequently reported. The yarn price declined sharply, and Japanese firms profited greatly from massive short positions. Until recently, the low price reached 158.90 yuan, setting a new low since the exchange was founded. Unexpectedly, the low market price triggered new buying activity. At the same time, rumors about currency notes were rampant, and short positions were heavily covered. After a prolonged decline, the market rebounded strongly once it gained momentum, and the upward movement was difficult to contain. It was rumored that a certain bank and other parties entered the market, actively buying. As a result, the upward trend became increasingly vigorous. In the final session, the price soared to 173 yuan. Within less than two weeks, the difference between the high and low prices was 14.10 yuan. The intensity of the surge was deeply concerning. In the end, only 850 bales were actually delivered out of the remaining 3,650 bales, with the rest being settled privately. The settlement price on the 3rd was 169 yuan. The names of the brokers and the number of bales for both the delivering and receiving parties are listed below:</p>

<p>The July term raw cotton was launched on February 8th of this year, with the price at 38 yuan. Later, due to poor conditions of American cotton, the decline of the yarn market, and the stagnation of cotton mills, coupled with the blockage of cotton from the Northwest, which was transported to Shanghai, the stock of raw cotton in Shanghai reached 100,000 bales. At the same time, the financial panic in Shanghai intensified, and the market price declined in a straight line, creating an overwhelming sense of hopelessness. The lowest price reached 30.04 yuan. Until recently, bullish parties, citing low prices and weak demand, prepared to squeeze shorts. The news was urgent, and the market price reversed sharply from the low, with margin calls soaring. Rumors of currency inflation were rampant. The market price was pushed higher and higher. In the final session, the price reached 35.50 yuan. In the end, only 8,100 bundles were actually delivered out of the remaining 17,300 bundles, with the rest being settled privately. The settlement price on the 3rd was 35 yuan. The names of the brokers and the number of bundles for both the delivering and receiving parties are listed below (unit: bundle):</p>

<p>The yarn market remains firm, and the market is filled with bullish sentiment. However, the conditions of cotton yarn overseas are weakening. The rumors of currency inflation and the devaluation of the national currency in this region are enough to cause uncertainty among investors. It is also said that certain banks and other parties have organized bullish companies to prepare to squeeze shorts in the August term. As a result, the market situation is turbulent. However, spot yarn prices have not increased significantly. Due to the high prices, customers' appetite has become sluggish. In reality, the financial situation in the interior is not yet sufficiently relaxed, farmers are struggling, and commodity prices are soaring, making purchasing power increasingly weak. Customers bought a total of 440 bales, and prices rose by one or two yuan. The purchase amounts of each customer group are listed below:</p>
<p>Guangdong 285  Xuzhou 20  Inland 10</p>
<p>Nanjing 5  Ningbo 10  Changsha 100</p>
<p>Zhenjiang 10</p>
<p>The cotton market is very firm, and the sentiment is boiling, with a consensus of bullishness due to the soaring yarn market and the various rumors in the market, all of which are positive. However, the situation of American cotton is lackluster. Only the margin calls have broken through the 900 yuan mark. Spot cotton trading is quite light. The sources are said to be 200 bales of Yao cotton and 300 bales of Tong cotton.</p>

<p>American New Cotton News Favorable  Yesterday, the American cotton market opened quietly. Liverpool news was unfavorable. Local and Liverpool parties sold, and each month's price fell by 1 to 8 points. Trading was light, and buyers were discouraged. Although the stock market rose in the afternoon, it was not enough to trigger new purchases. The market is currently stagnant. Cotton harvest and weather news are favorable. Finally, the market price fell again due to sales from local and New Orleans parties. The market stabilized before closing. Spot prices fell by 10 points, and futures prices fell by 8 to 13 points. English cotton spot prices fell by 2 points, and futures prices rose by 1 point. Indian cotton saw short covering and speculative buying, while operators took profits on long positions. Pitgole rose by half a rupee, Oomra rose by 1.5 rupees, and White Row Key rose by 1.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated July 29th):</p>

<h3 id="e184">Grains Thin Rice Arrivals, Prices Fall, Eastern New Rice 1 Yuan Lower than Initial Opening Price <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Local Rice (South Shanghai): Yesterday, rice market arrivals were all thin rice, accounting for thirteen or fourteen, with a total of nearly three thousand piculs. Therefore, although the Tianjin group undertook to buy 500 to 600 packages of thin rice, the situation eventually softened, and prices fell by more than one corner. As for Su Tong Japonica and South Port early rice, fortunately, there were no arrivals, so although sales in this street were weak, the market price was still able to stabilize. The supply and demand are similar to the original market, and there is no prosperity or decline in the market. Lu Jian rice is quite popular due to several days of out of stock. Dong Xin rice is selling at two corners, with the price opening at ten yuan, which is one yuan lower compared to the initial opening price. (North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were fourteen or fifteen ships from various sources downstream. Various types of white Japonica rice in the market were average, and the price trend was stable with a slight fatigue. Dong Xin Japonica rice had a strong trading volume, about two hundred or more piculs. Retail sales were sluggish, and the price was fatigued by two corners. Scattered transactions of white yuan continued to take place, and the price trend increased slightly by a corner. Gao Yang Jian rice was priced up by two corners due to its scarcity. The other types of rice were neither prosperous nor declining.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice: Yesterday, the sales volume of this rice by local customers had decreased. 5,800 bags of Saigon rice and 700 bags of Siamese rice with small strands were offered for sale all day, with a total transaction of less than 7,000 bags. As customer demand was weak, the market seemed to have a tendency to decline. However, both buyers and sellers were unwilling to let go easily, as the current inventory had decreased, and rumors of the silver issue and inflation were rampant, so they were even more unwilling to sell. Since the sellers insisted on not selling, the market then tended to stabilize again, and the later trend turned strong.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Excitement High, Flour and Wheat Become Expensive <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Flour Market: The distant futures market is once again showing an upward trend. Foreign wheat is reportedly up two corners in Chicago and up eight cents in Canada. At the time of opening prices, because this month is the last day, both buyers and sellers were engaged in closing out positions, so only in the three or four sessions did it rise by one point, and then it returned to flat. As for the various future months, due to the increasing rumors of inflation and the gradual rise in the price of gold, as well as the silver issue, the sentiment both inside and outside the industry is uniformly good. The buying interest is particularly strong, and the transaction volume has reached more than 700,000 packages. Large factories are still engaged in hedging sales, with a quantity of about 100,000 or more. However, the sentiment is still developing, and the market atmosphere has not been hit. Before the pros and cons of the inflation issue are clarified, it seems to be beneficial to the good prices of goods. As a result, this month is unchanged, August rose by 1.75 points, September rose by 1.5 points, October rose by 2.75 points, and November rose by point.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the futures market for all months showed a frantic upward trend. Although foreign wheat prices were up by only eight cents to one corner, the market sentiment was extremely excited. Industry insiders believed that the current wheat prices were very high, and the prices in various producing areas were also rising. Therefore, the opening prices were already strong. In the middle of the day, due to the rise in the flour market and the increasing rumors of inflation, buyers both inside and outside the industry were extremely enthusiastic, and the market rose step by step. As a result, each month showed a huge increase of up to one corner and one point, and the total increase also reached nine points to one corner. In this situation, it seems to be completely dominated by inflation rumors. As a result, August rose by one corner, September rose by one corner and one point, and October and November each rose by nine points. Spot wheat also rose by three to five points due to customer sales. However, in terms of the high-end goods, it has secretly risen nearly a corner. The opening price of Yangzhou wheat is 3.48 yuan, and the secondary wheat is 4.5 points, Zhenjiang wheat is 3.435 yuan, Shandong Yaowan Yanghe wheat is 3.62 yuan, Gaozi wheat is 3.478 yuan, Luhe Sixhe wheat is 3.5 yuan, Wuhe Sizhou wheat is 3.54 yuan, and Jiangbei wheat is 3.52 yuan. Fuxin shipped 7,500 packages, and Shenda shipped 1,000 packages.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market, due to the gradual increase in customs gold, the future price has reached 1.810, and the trend is suddenly tight. The association divided the market. The spot price of No. 1 coarse granulated white sugar was called 16 yuan, 3 jiao and 5 fen the day before yesterday. The transaction that was not completed yesterday was actually completed at 16 yuan and 6 jiao for 600 bags. The price increased by 3 jiao and 5 fen before and after. The transshipment price was called up by 2 jiao, which was 5 yuan. The Taikoo Sugar B mark was called 17 yuan and 8 jiao. The No. 1 cotton white sugar from this factory was called 15 yuan and 8 jiao. Neither of them were completed. The Hao market had Chaoji offering dozens of bags of Zhiyang, 11 yuan and 4 jiao and 5 fen. Zhengmian red for more than 50 bags, 11 yuan and 4 jiao, the Bang gang offered more than 200 bags of Xinghua red from Xun, 11 yuan to 10 yuan and 9 jiao, which all rose by one or two jiao. The Eastern White Red Sugar saw a consistent increase. The ER mark was called 16 Eastern Red Sugar 8 jiao and a half, the Mark was 8 jiao, the TP Mark was 7 jiao and a half, and the N Mark was 6 jiao, called 12 yuan and 4 jiao. (In the past, the No. 1 coarse white of the Japanese store was divided into 16 yuan and 4 jiao. The word "fen" was mistakenly placed after the word "jiao". It should be corrected.)</p>

<h3 id="e188">"Words of Warning in a Prosperous Age" <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>In the late Qing Dynasty, Tang Shoupeng of Shanyin, Zhejiang, once published a book called *Words of Warning in a Prosperous Age*. I was very young when I read that book, and now my impression is vague. The year before last, I saw something similar to *Words of Warning in a Prosperous Age* sent from Guangzhou; it worried that a great disaster of national subjugation and racial extinction was imminent, urging the people of the country to be vigilant and strive early. It was the heartfelt words of a concerned person. Among the people of the country, there were certainly those who were fearful, like Huang Zunxian (Gongdu), who wrote such poems after the Sino-Japanese War:</p>
<p>"Since abandoning Zhuyai, everyone has followed suit. Partitioning is only heard by guests, and when the fuel is exhausted, they turn to me for help.</p>
<p>In the days of Qin and Chu's diplomacy, the Sixteen Prefectures of You and Yan were lost. Never have I heard of the Northern and Southern Seas being everywhere choked.</p>
<p>The weak are preyed upon by the strong, everyone is in the tiger's mouth; the boundless map is divided, and all the land is leaving China.</p>
<p>Who cares about the Three Kingdoms, with the cross flag spread everywhere. Poland and India, who knows what the future holds?"</p>
<p>Decades have passed, and we have never tasted the great pain of racial extinction; national subjugation, as expected, does not necessarily involve great hardship, and most people can still live happy and bustling lives. Some people think of the "Words of Warning in a Prosperous Age" as a prediction like "a comet's tail sweeps across the Earth, and the Earth will be destroyed," treating it as a foreign tale and "listening to it just for fun."</p>
<p>During the reign of Emperor Wen of the Western Han Dynasty, there was a scholar named Jia Yi who was favored by Emperor Wen. When he made recommendations, Emperor Wen would listen attentively, but Jia Sheng's petitions and strategies were always accompanied by weeping and long sighs. Even with an enlightened ruler like Emperor Wen, Jia Sheng's weeping and long sighs were the words of warning for a prosperous era. Jia Sheng himself seemed very frustrated, crossing the Miluo River to mourn Qu Yuan, and later dying young from grief. Compared to another scholar who wept and sighed—Yuan Ang, who, by helping the emperor to eliminate the imperial clan, provoked the disaster of the Seven Kingdoms Rebellion and became a sacrifice to the slogan of "clearing the emperor's court"—Jia Sheng's words of warning were much more fortunate. Only in a prosperous era can there be words of warning, and only with an enlightened ruler like Emperor Wen could Jia Sheng's weeping and sighing avoid causing offense; prudence is the way to protect oneself, and the sages have given us a clever method. In the late Eastern Han Dynasty, the prohibitions against party members lasted for more than twenty years, and thousands of scholar-officials were killed and imprisoned. Later, the eunuch Lü Qiang told Emperor Ling of Han: "The prohibitions against party members have accumulated for a long time, and people are full of resentment. If they are not pardoned soon, they may conspire with Zhang Jiao, and the trouble will become greater, and it will be too late to regret." Emperor Ling became afraid and lifted the ban on party members. Soon after, the Yellow Turban Rebellion broke out, and the Eastern Han Dynasty came to an end. At that time, there was a scholar named Zhongchang Tong, who always sighed with indignation when discussing current affairs. His book *Chang Yan* denounced the government where "rulers and ministers indulge in licentiousness, and superiors and inferiors share the same evil," and attacked the powerful clans with "hundreds of interconnected buildings and fields full of fertile land," predicting the end of the Han Dynasty. This was also a Jia Sheng-style warning of weeping and sighing, and it was expected that it would be resented by the times; however, his own attitude was very passive, only wanting to live a reclusive life where he had "good fields and spacious houses, backing onto mountains and facing streams, surrounded by ditches and pools, with bamboo and trees all around, a threshing ground in front, and an orchard behind, with boats and carriages sufficient to replace the difficulty of walking, and servants sufficient to relieve the labor of the four limbs, nourishing parents with delicacies, and wives and children without the hardship of physical labor; when good friends come to visit, serving wine and delicacies to entertain them, and on auspicious days, slaughtering lamb and pork to offer." He was satisfied with this, so even though he spoke out boldly, he had no major worries.</p>
<p>Writing this, I am reminded of another kind of words of warning in a prosperous age. At the turn of the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the great scholar Huang Zongxi of the Southeast wrote a book called *Mingyi Daifang Lu* (*A Plan for the Prince*), of which only a thin volume remains. We speculate that the original book was at least four or five times larger than the existing one; these missing parts were all deleted by the enlightened rulers of the early Qing Dynasty, Kangxi, Yongzheng, and Qianlong; the "Ten-Complete Emperor" who revered antiquity and valued literature subjected *Mingyi Daifang Lu* to a slow and painful execution. Huang Zongxi believed that Jizi presented the *Hong Fan* (Grand Norm) and King Wu listened attentively; his *Daifang Lu* would one day see the light of day. Little did he expect that later King Wus would want Confucius to delete the *Book of Songs* and mutilate the *Hong Fan*. Therefore, words of warning can only be spoken in a vague way; if they are to be as specific as in *Mingyi Daifang Lu*, one can only follow Sima Qian's method of storing them in famous mountains and passing them on to the right person.</p>
<p>Someone said: Isn't Han Feizi's *Signs of Ruin* an even more specific words of warning in a prosperous age? Han Feizi listed forty-seven signs of ruin (signs of ruin do not necessarily mean inevitable ruin, but indicate the possibility of ruin). Among them, the most essential are: "If ministers study, disciples are fond of arguing, merchants accumulate wealth abroad, and the common people are in internal distress, the state can be ruined. If people rely on auspicious days, serve ghosts and gods, believe in divination, and are fond of sacrifices, the state can be ruined. If people are fond of cruel punishments and do not adhere to the law, like to argue without seeking practical use, and indulge in flowery writing without regard for its effectiveness, the state can be ruined. If people rely on foreign aid and neglect their neighbors, and rely on the help of powerful states and despise the countries they oppress, the state can be ruined. If people like to use cleverness to circumvent the law, often mix private interests with public affairs, frequently change laws and prohibitions, and issue orders repeatedly, the state can be ruined. If the command of armies and the appointment of generals are too important, and the defense of the borders is entrusted to high-ranking officials, who act arbitrarily and make decisions without seeking permission, the state can be ruined. If people see great benefits but do not pursue them, hear of dangers but do not prepare for them, are shallow in matters of defense, and try to adorn themselves with benevolence and righteousness, the state can be ruined." Later, the state of Han was indeed ruined by these, and other states like Chu, Qi, Yan, and Zhao were also ruined by these. Han Feizi's words were all unfortunately accurate. Before Qu Yuan drowned himself in the Miluo River, he could still write a long *Nine Chapters* and short, satisfying articles to vent his grievances, while Han Feizi's forty-seven signs of ruin can be completely preserved to this day. If he had lived in the era of the Ten-Complete Emperor who revered antiquity and valued literature, could Han Feizi have avoided the fate of *Mingyi Daifang Lu*?</p>
<p>The above are all old stories from the past.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Science Is Not a Docile Child <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Te</p>
<p>The progress of science is becoming faster and faster. From primitive humans to Hesiod, the Greek poet, it was about 50,000 years or more. From Hesiod to Leonardo da Vinci, it was about 2,500 years. From da Vinci to Benjamin Franklin, it was 350 years. From Franklin to today, it has been 150 years. The achievements of each era are always much richer than those of the previous era.</p>
<p>Humanity itself is still very young, but science is still in its infancy. Our knowledge is like a ball, and everything we learn is built on the surface of the ball. What we do not know is the space outside the ball—boundless.</p>
<p>Science from thirty years ago is now obsolete. Old science libraries are simply large piles of dead facts, covered in dust, with no one asking about them, but this neglect is often too much.</p>
<p>Scientists are the noblest kind of people, they not only seek realization, but also add some light to the future of mankind.</p>
<p>The struggle of mankind today is a war of conquest. We must strive to overcome the forces of nature and utilize them. But to know oneself and one's enemy is to win every battle. Therefore, if we want to win, we must first know them. If we do not know where the enemy is, where do we start the attack?</p>
<p>The greatest tool of science is the human brain. Intelligence is more important and more powerful than telescopes, microscopes, and galvanometers. The spirit of creation flourishes endlessly, so the hope for the progress of science is almost infinite.</p>
<p>Science is not limited by time, does not belong to any one country, does not belong to any one continent, does not belong to any one century, does not even belong to this world, nor does it belong to the solar system, but it belongs to the universe.</p>
<p>We may think that scientists and ordinary people behave differently, but this is a misconception. Scientists are also people, often very ordinary people, but their work exceeds the efforts of other people. If you want to despise science, you must be careful, because behind it lies permanent, unlimited power, and creation.</p>
<p>The work of art, no matter how admirable, is only a reflection of an ideal. Science offers us fragments of reality. In other words, art is human, science is superhuman.</p>
<p>Scientists have inventors, critics, and scholars of various kinds. These people each have their own characteristics. A true scientist can melt these many characteristics into one, but they are rarely combined in one person. Scientists focus on research, sometimes emphasizing one aspect and sometimes lacking other aspects.</p>
<p>Invention comes from perseverance. Famous scientists all have great and glorious tenacity.</p>
<p>Self-confidence is the most needed by scientists. When he enters the laboratory, he must have the belief and the enthusiasm of a Christian martyr.</p>
<p>There are several great inventions in the world that were not made by scientists. Such as the English physician Jenner's invention of the smallpox vaccine, the French physician Laennec's invention of diagnostics. Also, the French diplomat Lesseps was not an engineer, but his successful career surpassed the work of hundreds of capable engineers. (Note: Lesseps was the planner of the Suez Canal).</p>
<p>The ideal scientist has no other desires besides his scientific research and does not care about the gain or loss of power. He spends his precious time in the laboratory, surrounded only by three or four students who are dedicated to learning. Every day when he comes out of the laboratory, his mind is always filled with creative dreams. In front of him, there is always a light like a bright star, guiding him to a new invention, large or small.</p>
<p>Now, many complete laboratories have been built in various countries, with bright electric lights and sophisticated and strange instruments. But Lavoisier (French chemist, improved the method of making gunpowder, discovered the composition of air, and clarified the properties of oxygen), Pasteur (French chemist and microscope scholar, discovered the principle of fermentation, and studied the rabies vaccination treatment), Curie (French chemist, discovered radium), and many other workers all completed their great inventions in poor and humble houses.</p>
<p>Science is not a docile and polite child who is satisfied with some comfort and love. It is harsh, cold, and merciless, and is often willing to make great sacrifices over the years for a very small hobby.</p>
<p>The greatest inventions can be summed up in a short phrase. Lavoisier said: "Life is a chemical phenomenon." Pasteur determined that all diseases are caused by parasites. Chemistry, physics, and medicine are nothing more than the development of these two themes.</p>
<p>Blind suspicion and blind faith come from the same source. Believing without any evidence and not believing any evidence are equally foolish.</p>
<p>A true scientist must dare to be revolutionary. He must also hold a skeptical attitude towards the most respected theories. He must discuss everything, he must closely study everything. Scientific thought comes from curiosity, medical thought is in the pursuit of safety. But the safety of doctors must be based on the curiosity of scientists.</p>
<p>There is a kind of academic system in science, everything is fine and extremely fine. But the historical and descriptive sciences have a range that is much narrower than that of experimental science. Chemistry and physics have now surpassed everything. Physics can give us insight into the properties of all things.</p>
<p>This history of science is a history of mistakes. Some of these mistakes are very large, and sometimes extremely ridiculous. But on the whole, the losses of the former are the teachers of the latter, and their mistakes are also beneficial to people.</p>
<p>Since Lavoisier, there is no longer any doubt that life can be scientifically produced. But this burning of all life is not the only purpose of life. It cannot be believed that creation patiently creates countless organisms, giving them different shapes and sophisticated and complex machines, solely for the purpose of producing more heat, water, and carbonic acid. Therefore, the chemical force of the living world must become a tool, but not a result.</p>
<p>Diligent work is not enough to make a great invention, and even a small invention will not be made because of it. Many warriors have lived the diligent life of scientists, but what have they achieved? They have failed both opportunity and wisdom.</p>
<p>The history of science proves that, with the exception of mathematics, all progress cannot be achieved solely through theories inspired by libraries or research institutes. It is necessary to constantly observe and constantly experiment to achieve progress.</p>
<p>An experiment, no matter how clumsy the plan is, or how clumsy the implementation, is more valuable than a bright theory.</p>
<p>Future inventions are endless, and countless treasures are buried in everything hidden.</p>

<p>— Written by the German writer Storm, translated by Chen Yinzhi</p>
<p>"So I went to her house, and as I expected, I met her in a side room in her aunt's house, where her housekeeping was. She was standing in the middle of the room, her face pale, her teeth biting her lips, biting them until blood flowed down. All the drawers and boxes were opened by her; lace and pieces of cloth were scattered all over the floor around. 'Nali!' I shouted, 'What are you doing, Nali?' But she seemed not to hear me. — 'Is there dancing in the dance hall on Sunday?' she asked. 'Dance hall? — What does that have to do with you!' — 'I want to go dancing!' — 'You? What would your sweetheart say?' — 'What does my sweetheart have to do with me!' — At this time, she had already put on her hat and taken out her scarf from the wardrobe. Then she opened a small box, in which she usually kept the money she had saved; — although she usually liked to spend money on decorations, she always saved some money so that she would not go to her bridegroom's house naked. Now she tore open the paper package and put the money in her pocket. 'Are you coming with me?' she asked, but she insisted that I go, so I followed her, because I still hoped to dissuade her from dancing. But my words were all in vain, because she hurried along the street with me, neither listening to a word I said nor looking at me.</p>
<p>"When we walked into the market and stood in front of the cloth shop counter, she called the shop assistant to bring out the best-looking silk and the most fashionable brocade gauze to look at, which she usually only saw in the houses of the noblest people in the city. She searched among them, making a mess of things. The shop assistant also took out a piece of goods. 'If the lady who buys the flower material can afford the price...!' he said, putting his hand under this transparent material. 'It doesn't matter,' Nali said, 'she can afford the price'. — I secretly touched her, because I now understood that she was going to buy this expensive material for herself. 'Nali,' I said softly, 'I ask you to think again, what do you want this expensive thing for?' — But she paid no attention, she called the shop assistant to cut the material, and counted the shiny money on the counter. She seemed not to think about how much sweat she had shed to earn this money. 'Don't mind me,' she said, when I kept pulling her arm, 'I always want to wear good clothes once, I am not uglier than the most beautiful girl here!'"</p>
<h3 id="e191">Sleepless Night (Part 2) <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Long Zaitian</p>
<p>Space expanded infinitely, and time gradually passed. Kang Yu and Meina's breathing gradually made him jealous; and the sound of the wind in the tops of the poplar trees grew tighter and tighter, causing the two windows to rattle, making the late night even more eerie and frightening; the sound of the chain on the wall that broke through the silence insisted on chiming twice... Liangfu then deliberately turned over hard, making his bed vibrate to boost his courage. But after a moment of calm, the wounds that life had given him, the pale face of his mother who had encountered unexpected misfortune, crept like insects onto his swollen meninges.</p>
<p>First, countless sparks burst out in his eyes. These countless sparks condensed into the pale face of his mother. Her sparse, gray hair swayed weakly; in her sunken eye sockets, few eyelashes were covered with lonely tears, which dripped down, wetting her thin face completely.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the drooping top of the bed transformed into a huge Western-style building. Then, in a dizzying manner, all the outlines blurred and magnified. His body seemed to have been transported to a newly built, exquisite Western-style house, and a middle-aged man wearing black tortoiseshell-rimmed glasses kept saying to him:</p>
<p>"We are looking for people based on the work, not looking for work based on the people. If two people or one person can do the job, we will never add another. We never have anyone idle..."</p>
<p>After hearing this unnecessary "official talk," he couldn't help feeling indignant and planned to reply to the middle-aged man forcefully, but he couldn't make a sound. It turned out that the quilt was pressing on his upper chest, and everything was quiet. So Liangfu pushed the quilt away a little and turned over again.</p>
<p>The clock on the wall, clearly and as if to warn him especially, forcefully struck four times! The summer night was short, and the eastern glass window had already let in the light of dawn. The broken-legged stool, the messy pile on the table, the kerosene lamp with the broken bulb, and the bottles and jars all revealed their hazy lines. This, in turn, caused Liangfu to feel a strong sense of irritation; especially after the recurrence of the mole on the edge of his eyelid, he felt a spasm-like tremor; finally, it made him attempt to use extremely base methods to induce sleep.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was truly effective? He fell asleep hazily. But after a short while, he woke up with a loud shout.</p>
<p>"What's wrong? Liangfu, don't scare me to death!" The lively Kang Yu was the first to ask him.</p>
<p>Liangfu was also awake at this time, knowing that it was the customary sleep paralysis, but he was very embarrassed to receive Kang Yu's question, and instead held his breath, not daring to move at all, pretending that nothing had happened. It wasn't until Kang Yu's snoring resumed that he grandly turned over. Before long, a messy sound of footsteps came, which made him unable to sleep peacefully anymore. Liangfu then reluctantly hugged his sore and thin legs, carried his rather heavy and swollen head, and climbed out of bed.</p>

<h3 id="e193">Strengthening the People's Foundation <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Yiting, a leader in Shanghai's business community, recently told a reporter from the New Voice Society that the current state of economic decline in our country is extremely precarious. The foundation of a country lies in its people, and if the people's foundation is shaken, how can the country stand? Based on his qualifications as a merchant, he observed the lack of silver reserves in the country and the increasingly sophisticated methods of foreign powers manipulating finance. He believed that our country's situation was difficult and in urgent need of reform. Therefore, he submitted a proposal to the authorities, urging them to establish concrete measures as soon as possible to cope with the situation and strengthen the people's foundation.</p>
<p>Our country has always had a famous saying: "The country is established by the people, and the people exist with the country." If this sentence is interpreted in a "modern" way, it means that the existence of the country lies in protecting and enriching the people, and the happiness of the people lies in having a strong and independent country. In fact, these two are two aspects of the same thing. The strength of the country lies in whether there are prosperous people, and the prosperity of the people can determine the strength of the country; otherwise, this country contains internal contradictions.</p>
<p>Because in our country's situation, recently, the industrial decline, the rural bankruptcy, and it's increasingly developing into a financial crisis and a fiscal crisis. Especially after the implementation of the American silver policy, the outflow of Chinese silver has extremely shaken China's currency unit. The great powers at this time are expressing various "good intentions" of "helping" China, advocating that China should establish connections with the US dollar, British pound, gold, etc. Of course, if we still want to strengthen the people's foundation firmly, these kindnesses are difficult for us to accept.</p>
<p>However, if China's currency value is to be stable and avoid financial and fiscal crises, we must first balance international payments. To balance international payments, we must curb the large-scale import of foreign goods and revive our country's industry and agriculture. Therefore, we advise those who are working hard to "strengthen the people's foundation" to ask themselves how to create the preconditions for achieving this goal. Otherwise, the "people's foundation" will have no way to be strengthened, and the founding of the country will become a major problem.</p>
<h3 id="e194">A Walk in the Deep Mountains on a Summer Night <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Er</p>
<p>Mountains, shady forests, ancient temples, pavilions, the sound of bells, white houses, young people, soft and low murmurs, all shrouded in the misty, bright, silvery gauze, silver mist-like moonlight, an endless expanse of haziness, drunk and wanting to dissolve; people, as if in a dream, on the moon in the sky: the hearts of young people, so fluttering?</p>
<p>"Float! Float to the ends of the earth... Float to..."</p>
<p>Slowly turning their gaze to the mountaintop, trembling with joy</p>
<p>"Look, that moon rising upwards, that golden plate, that..."</p>
<p>Like a golden fruit that can be plucked with a hand, forgetting that this is the human world. The surroundings are quiet, solemn, and beautifully tranquil. The light and refreshing breeze of Lingnan, incessantly blowing through the gray-white pavilion open on all sides, several young people in the pavilion, collapsed on the terrazzo floor, leaning against the pillars, not lost in thought, but immersed in a realm beyond the mundane, suddenly, someone slowly, gently said:</p>
<p>"Let's go, take advantage of the moonlight to walk at night!"</p>
<p>"Oh,... the cool breeze is so wonderful, the night is so intoxicating, slowly..." A companion responded slowly, as if reciting poetry.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>On hot summer nights, this Han Mountain Valley by the Han River, more cool and beautiful than the seaside, the foothills, have all become good places to escape the summer heat, a dreamland for young people. At night, they often abandon their stuffy dormitories, go to the cool pavilions on the mountain foothills to cool off, sometimes falling asleep leisurely, reluctant to return even in the middle of the night. The school vacation has begun, and the people inside the white houses are all restless. Mothers urge them to return, and homesickness stirs, so they pack their luggage with their fellow villagers and return home. The route back home is full of towering mountains and ridges, young people, in order to accustom their feet to the stinging thorns on the path of life, do not sit in sedan chairs carried by others, willingly letting their tender feet be pricked and worn by the thorns. But in the fierce summer sun, the stifling heat is like being burned while climbing endless high mountains and sloping ridges, which is often daunting for young people. So they pat each other on the chest and shout—don't be afraid! It's good to walk in the cool of the night!</p>
<p>Take an umbrella, wear thin short shirts and trousers, carry a small bag, and cheerfully and heroically go to the cool pavilion, waiting for the moon to rise before setting off. However, the night is cool and the moonlight is beautiful, the beauty of the mountains intoxicates and keeps people lingering, slowly and slowly, delaying the departure.</p>
<p>"Don't fall asleep! The cool night is intoxicating, but the journey must be taken!"</p>
<p>The moon rises higher, the night becomes more beautiful, the travelers become more intoxicated, leisurely, densely, but the time of deep intoxication passes especially quickly. The croaking of frogs gradually intensifies:</p>
<p>"Friends, let's go! It's almost midnight, let's go! That distant and difficult journey!"</p>
<p>Several times urging each other, several times struggling, dragging soft and deeply intoxicated legs forward: go! Go!, the heroic and beautiful voices of young people, resound in the beautiful and intoxicated night.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the night curtain hangs deeply, a piece of haziness: in the distance, lush and verdant, mountains and sky, blocking the way. Distant, boundless, the tender hearts of young people, will tremble slightly. However, we must go! The road that must be taken! Lift up your spirits, embolden yourself, and hurry on your way firmly. Breaking through the dark mountain valleys, the shadowy winding paths, the grass nests, and then turning into even darker mountain hollows, one stage after another, deathly silent, quiet, desolate to the point of extinction, desolate, only the misty and faint moonlight, leaking out from the cloud crevices, stealing a photo, allowing pedestrians to walk, in addition, the wind gently shakes the mountains and forests, playing a sad and low whispering rustling sound, human shadows, footsteps, lonely travelers, constantly emboldening themselves, step by step climbing up, the soles of their feet drunk and sore, people tired, but, the journey is long, so we can only keep walking: ahead is the endless dark deep mountain.</p>
<p>In this deep mountain night, the young people, again discover that there are fellow travelers between the mountain hollows ahead. Unconsciously, they gather more courage, echoing each other with loud shouts, hurrying to catch up:</p>
<p>Panting as they catch up, the tired hearts of the young people are even more ashamed. It turns out to be a team of male and female coolies, carrying loads of about a hundred pounds on their injured shoulders, gasping and panting as they move forward, their tense expressions, their voices, make people feel tragic! Their lives are even harder! They not only have to walk this thorny mountain road in the dark night, but also have to bear this heavy burden on their shoulders, and yet they still struggle hard, young and unburdened people, how should they work doubly hard! The hearts of the travelers, are moved by the hard-working coolies. They continue to walk in a large group: "Go! Friends, take advantage of the dark night to hurry on the road, finish the dark night, and wait for dawn to reach your destination;"</p>
<h3 id="e195">The Cultural Street of Beiping <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Yueshan</p>
<p>Some people call Beiping a "cultural city," but in fact, the material foundation of modern culture in Beiping seems to be less solid than that of Shanghai. Take a few of the more famous bookstores, for example: the Commercial Press, the Zhonghua Book Company, and their main factories are all in Shanghai; and so on, the Guanming Book Company, the Modern Book Company, and other bookstores, only have branches in Beiping. In terms of distribution and printing, all the bookstores seem to think that Shanghai is more convenient than Beiping, and in reality, Shanghai is indeed more convenient than Beiping; then the name "cultural city" seems to should be given to Shanghai, so why is Beiping the cultural city instead?</p>
<p>Thinking carefully, Beiping is neither a commercial city, nor a political city, nor an industrial city, and in terms of population, it is the second largest city in the country; it seems inappropriate not to give such a large city sitting in the second position a more beautiful name. So, comparatively speaking, Beiping is still a cultural city; anyway, Beiping has enough professors and students, and enough poets and men of letters, so it is not too much, or too untrue to call it a cultural city. I think, this is the origin of the "cultural city."</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the cultural street in the cultural city.</p>
<p>Don't misunderstand, thinking that there is really a street in Beiping called Cultural Street; there isn't. Cultural Street is Liulichang, commonly known as Changdian. Liulichang doesn't actually have any factories that actually make glass, it's just called that; this is like Songshu Street not necessarily having pine trees, Yangrou Hutong not necessarily having mutton, and so on; it's just called that. As for why, even the oldest of the old Beiping people can't figure it out, let alone me.</p>
<p>As for why Liulichang is called Cultural Street, I do know this. The reason is: there are many bookstores, many stationery shops, many shops selling paintings and calligraphy, and many shops selling antiques and curios. Let me say something interesting: the signs of the "cultural shops" (let's call them that) in Cultural Street are all written quite impressively, there are absolutely no ugly ones, or bad ones, from this point alone, you can see a bit of the flavor of Cultural Street.</p>
<p>To put it more practically, Cultural Street should not only be Liulichang, Yangmeizhu Slanting Street outside the east entrance of Liulichang should also be called Cultural Street, the World Book Company, the Kaiming Bookstore, and other bookstores are on that Slanting Street, and there are also quite a few antique and stationery shops; but compared to Liulichang, it always seems to be inferior. Cultural Street and Slanting Street both run east-west, separated by a street with an interesting name: Yichi Dajie (One-Foot Street), Yichi Dajie is not long or big, it is just slightly curved, separating Cultural Street and Slanting Street; otherwise, Slanting Street could very well be named Liulichang and share the name of Cultural Street.</p>
<p>No matter what, the area from Liulichang to Yangmeizhu Slanting Street always has some cultural color. Most of the "cultural shops" in this area still sell old books, followed by calligraphy and painting shops (mounting and rubbing shops belong to this category), the fewest are the few shops selling new books. From this, you can also see the general picture of Cultural Street. Beiping is, after all, a place where men of letters have frequented for many years, so there are naturally more things like old books and old calligraphy. The first half of the first month of the solar and lunar years is the period when Changdian is open. The so-called opening is just adding a temporary market to join in the fun. During the opening period, from Hepingmen through Normal University to the southern end of Nan Xinhua Street, there is a street two li long, full of stalls selling old books and old calligraphy, and men of letters naturally frequent it; this shows the power of old books in Beiping.</p>
<p>In the new book industry, only the facade of the Commercial Press is beautiful, with a building; this is the only building in Cultural Street, and I imagine it must be different from the cultural street in Shanghai with its rows of tall buildings. Cultural Street is just like the cultural city, old and simple; old books and old calligraphy support Cultural Street, and the power of new books is not great in Cultural Street. As for new magazines and other books, the sales locations are no longer Cultural Street, Dong'an Market and Xidan Market are their strongholds, and buying magazines and going to Cultural Street will mostly be disappointed.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Lotus <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Sizhong</p>
<p>I haven't seen lotus flowers for a long time. This time, when I came home, I saw a pot of lotus flowers in the courtyard, just budding and waiting to bloom, and I was extremely happy in my heart. The ancients said, "The lotus is the gentleman among flowers." This statement is not the reason why I love camellias, because I am not a so-called upper-class gentleman. According to the principle of gathering things by category and having personal preferences, I naturally would not use the qualifications of a gentleman to appreciate and compare plants that are like gentlemen. I love it, but I'd rather say it's the prompting of the environment and based on the inherent nature of loving nature. For several years, I've been trapped in the city of Shanghai, with streets full of smoke and dust, and dense clusters of houses like beehives. It's really quite difficult to see a little bit of light and simple plants. Moreover, being suppressed by life, I don't have time to go to Chinese-style gardens like Bansong Garden to admire some verdant plants. Recently, I was fortunate to have an opportunity to escape to the quiet countryside, and seeing the elegant plants in my own home refreshed my spirit and vision, how could it not make people happy?</p>
<p>In addition, the lotus flower is indeed a plant worthy of love. Look at those round leaves, with a verdant and elegant color, supported on graceful and gentle branches, swaying in the wind, truly lovely. Even those small tender leaves, draped on the water surface, or curled up tender leaves, using small and delicate tender branches, supporting like a small umbrella, shading under the large leaves, are as cute as petite and delicate infants. The flower buds grow from a small bud, all the way until they are budding and waiting to bloom, they have already grown to be like radiant young girls. When the flower hearts bloom in full bloom, and the green petals turn white, revealing individual white stamens in a pot of green, it is truly pleasing to see. If the flower heart is further unfolded, and the yellow stamens are inverted like hanging tassels, attracting one or two small bees to soar there, that would be even more interesting.</p>
<p>When I came home, I encountered many rainy days. I didn't go out for a long day, so I quietly sat in front of the courtyard, appreciating that pot of elegant color. In the rain, the lotus flower is even more lovely. The leaves, being struck by raindrops, tilt slightly, and the raindrops slip on the smooth leaf surface, and then slip out, dripping and shattering on the ground, like the smashing of pearls. Sometimes the concave part of the leaf heart is filled with raindrops, unable to pour out, so they roll roundly and continuously on the leaf heart, which is even more beautiful. The lotus flower in the rain is even more lovely, the petals are wetted by rainwater, and they feel fresher, giving people a kind of fresh taste. The rain threads stir up wrinkles on the water surface, and on a pot of mud, the water surface is exceptionally clear, which is truly helpful in clearing the mood.</p>
<p>For the lotus, it can also evoke a little bit of warm memories, which was in the year I was seventeen. At that time, the school was on summer vacation, and I was living in the countryside. Every evening, I always walked with my classmate, Miss Lin, together by a lotus pond. In the moment when the evening breeze swept through, smelling the bursts of fragrance carried by the wind, watching the swimming fish swim in the gaps between the lotus stems, and because of the vastness of the pond and the countless lotus flowers, so that the eyes were full of pure white stamens, stirring up pure emotions in the hearts of the two people, we often walked until late at night before going back to sleep. If it was a moonlit night, we would be even more delighted. At that time, the tea leaves were lush, and the dewdrops on the leaf surface, reflecting the moonlight, were crystal clear and very lovely. In the quiet countryside, with eyes full of fields, a pool of shallow water, and the fragrance wafting in the air, it is deeply evocative to imagine the pure and simple mood of the young people, and the warm words that were inspired by it. Later, as I rushed around, the pure friendship was lost, and I rarely saw the beautiful lotus flowers. Now, I can only see this small pot in my own courtyard in my hometown, which is also a consolation. And the lost warm memories make people love friendship and lotus flowers together, which can be said to be the reason why I love lotus flowers.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Red Eggs <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Jia</p>
<p>My wife's belly is getting bigger day by day, and when friends meet, they always shout:</p>
<p>"Congratulations, congratulations! When are you treating us to red eggs?"</p>
<p>On the surface, I always deal with them with a smile, but in my heart, their congratulatory voices are simply like a steel knife specially stabbing my heart!</p>
<p>I am not a person who dislikes children, and I always have a happy heart when I see the children of relatives, friends, and neighbors. No matter how troubled I am, as long as I see a child, I will feel relieved. Since getting married, I have been hoping to have a child as soon as possible, but now that this hope is about to be realized, my heart feels like it has a big stone on it. A kind of unbearable worry has been growing in my heart as my wife's belly gets bigger!</p>
<p>A child is indeed an angel in a family, and he can offer a lot of happiness to the family. However, there must be considerable conditions to have such an angel. Without considerable conditions, even if there is a child, it is just a burden. Like me, I am definitely not qualified to be the father of a little angel. My monthly income is only enough to maintain the minimum living standard of the two of us, and it will be difficult to live if we add another person. In this situation, how can I deserve a little angel! It's just a burden!</p>
<p>My wife also loves children, and when she found out she was pregnant, she was so happy that she cried with laughter. She was always fantasizing about everything after having a child. She said that she would be a good mother and turn the child into a strong man. From a young age, she would give him good habits, keep him clean, not be greedy, not make trouble, not waste, not... In the future, she would send him to school so that he would be knowledgeable and be able to contribute to the country, and also bring honor to his parents...</p>
<p>In order not to break my wife's sweet dreams, I always smiled and agreed with her opinions. She said, "I want to buy a sailor suit for the child," I agreed; she said she wanted to buy high-end toys for the child, I agreed; she said, "In the future, I want to send the child to better schools, even if the tuition is more expensive, it doesn't matter," I also agreed. I would rather break my own heart, but I don't want to destroy her fantasies of happiness.</p>
<p>However, my wife's sweet dream was ultimately broken by herself. She noticed that I often frowned, and earnestly asked me if I had any hidden pain. At first, I deceived her with irrelevant words, but later I couldn't hide it. I had to sigh and say:</p>
<p>"I also want to turn the child into a promising person, but, many farmers' children have extraordinary talents, but they didn't become great people, but just remained farmers, there's nothing poor people can do! Let's not talk about the future, even when the child is born, and friends ask us for red eggs, it will be unbearable enough!"</p>
<p>So, an extremely unbearable hidden pain also grew in my wife's heart. She no longer fantasized, and she also felt that a child was not something that our kind of family should have.</p>
<p>Now, my wife is about to give birth. Every time friends ask us for red eggs, we don't even have the courage to put on a smiling mask and deal with them.</p>
<p>Red eggs can only be had under considerable conditions!</p>

<p>The Cangzhou Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road, now, for the sake of providing coolness and entertainment for all sectors, spared no expense to open the never-before-opened Cangzhou Garden as an open-air cinema, equipped with Western Electric Company's sound equipment. It opened yesterday, showing the film "Lonely String Elegy" starring the screen heartthrob George Raft, with seats divided into two types: one yuan and fifty cents.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Shepherd Boy Hero and Beauty <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>In the Yi Hua Film Company, the "shepherd boy," "hero," and "beauty" were discovered.</p>
<p>The shepherd boy is Ying Yunwei, the director of "Hero of the Times." It turned out that one day, while filming under the scorching sun, Ying Yunwei fashioned an extraordinarily large straw hat in the props room and put it on his head, resembling a shepherd boy on the back of a cow. However, Qiu Yiwei pointed to Zhang Jiaxiang in "Iron Rooster," because Zhang Jiaxiang's words led to Ying Wei, who is Shang Guanwu. Goodness, this gentleman is so tall that one would immediately imagine the demeanor of Xiang Yu, the Conqueror of Chu. Jiang Xiu said that Shang Guanwu had co-starred with Xu Qin芳in "Farewell My Concubine" and "went wild," almost scaring away the spirit of Yu Ji. It can be seen that he looks like a hero. Ying Yunwei invited him to play the hero in "Hero of the Times," which is truly what the people of Shanghai call "matching his appetite."</p>
<p>But where is the beauty? Don't rush: Look, as the gauze window is moved, the musk fragrance assaults the senses, and a figure is faintly revealed, with stunning beauty. Who is this person? She is the hero's object, the beauty Hu Ping! Hu Ping plays the beauty in "Hero of the Times," and her magic is great. It is often said that when her delicate eyebrows are slightly raised, the hero becomes anxious. Ying Yunwei's technique shows considerable skill. When it is screened in the future, it will surely move people's hearts to the utmost.</p>

<p>The domestically produced detective masterpiece "Black Shadow," a great production by the Great Wall Film Company, will soon be screened at the Jin Cheng Grand Theatre. The film stars Gao Zhanfei, Wang Yuanlong, Hu Ping, Zhang Meiyu, Shang Guanwu, Yuan Congmei, Zhang Zhizhi, and Xu Huayuan. In addition, Chen Dabei and Wu Wenchao also play important roles in the film. The story tells of a cunning and vicious young man who is blinded by greed and commits a series of bloody crimes. Moreover, the methods he uses to kill are elusive and unpredictable, leaving the great detective helpless. The plot is full of twists and turns, captivating the audience and immersing them in an atmosphere of terror and confusion from beginning to end. Recently, movie fans seem to be extremely interested in detective films, such as "Covering One's Body in Courage," which recently premiered at the Da Guangming Theatre, has achieved great success in terms of box office revenue. Therefore, it is expected that the premiere of "Black Shadow" will cause a sensation, not only because it is a detective film, but also because so many stars are co-starring in a film, which is a miracle that has never happened before in the domestic film industry.</p>

<h3 id="e207">Overview of the 1935 Buick New Car <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>Since 1935, the Buick Motor Company has joined the low-price car industry, providing another new contribution to the automotive industry. This contribution is none other than the company's newly released six-cylinder car. This product is comparable to the company's improved and perfected straight-eight-cylinder car. All the important reforms and progress that the company implemented on the eight-cylinder car last year, as well as all the design and construction features, are also available on this lower-priced six-cylinder car. The six-cylinder car's body styles include two-door and four-door sedans, two-door convertible sedans, coupe, sports coupe, and multi-purpose coupe, among others.</p>
<p>One of the most prominent features of the 1935 Buick car is that its engineers were uniquely able to achieve the ultimate streamlined design and implement it on the entire car, while at the same time ensuring that it was just right, without being bizarre, which would detract from the aesthetic appeal. This is a unique feature of Buick and is already widely appreciated, so there is no need to elaborate. However, when considering the success of this novel style, the credit should first be given to the adoption of the Fisher No Draft Ventilation Solid Steel "Turret Top" body. The safety, comfort, and aesthetics of this structure have reached their peak and are incomparable to any previous Fisher body. The entire solid steel roof is supported on steel brackets and welded together with the other steel parts of the body, making it extremely strong. Thus, passengers in the car are surrounded by steel armor, making their absolute safety self-evident.</p>
<p>Another feature of the new Buick car that differs from previous structures is the use of greatly improved hydraulic brakes, equipped with double-layer and triple-layer sealed brake drums, which are not vulnerable to water and dust. The new car doors are much wider, especially on the two-door models, making it easier to get in and out and more comfortable. All models have more interior space, and the seats are wider. Headroom has been greatly increased. As for the split front seats of the two-door models, they are a new creation and particularly outstanding. The radiator and engine cover are beautiful and pleasing to the eye. The wing panels and headlights are streamlined. The V-shaped windshield has always been a feature of the car body, and Buick is the first to use it on low-priced cars.</p>
<p>The luggage compartment space on all new Buick cars has generally increased. Sedan models have a special luggage compartment in the rear, where the spare tire can also be stored. As for convertible sedan models, the luggage space is even more spacious due to the installation of a luggage rack. In terms of mechanics, the various improvements of the new Buick car are too numerous to mention. The knee-action part is now mounted on a 2 3/4-inch torque tube, making it more robust and comfortable. As for the steering ratio, it has now been increased to 17.5:1, making steering easier. The entire electrical system has greatly increased in capacity, making starting easier. As for the various improvements in the carburetor manifold, the warm-up time required for starting is shortened. In addition, the lubrication and cooling systems remain the same. In terms of mechanics, the most noteworthy feature is the silver alloy connecting rod bearing, which is much more resistant to the high temperatures generated during high-speed driving than any metal used before. The new Buick car is even stronger than the 1934 model. In terms of weight, the six-cylinder four-door car weighs 3,400 pounds, while the extended eight-cylinder car weighs 3,550 pounds. In short, Buick has improved and perfected every aspect of the engine, chassis, and body, making it impeccable. This is why its safety, reliability, comfort, utility, and economy are all outstanding.</p>
